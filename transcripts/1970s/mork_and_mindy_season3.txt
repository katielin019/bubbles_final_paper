{START OF EPISODE 1}
Oh, Dad, it's so good to have you back.
How was your trip?
Well, Baltimore was okay, but after two months in a hotel room, l was ready to come home.
From the clippings you sent, it sounds as if your orchestra was well received.
Yeah, it was great to hear all those people coming out of the concert hall whistling Stravinsky.
So how have things been going around here?
- Not so good, Dad.
lt's Mork.
- lt's always Mork.
No, wait till you see him.
He's really changed.
- ln what way?
- You wouldn't believe it.
lt's the last thing in the world you'd expect from Mork.
How much could he change?
Unless he's grown another head.
Kitten, l'm home.
Another day Another day, another inflated dollar.
Hello, hon.
Big kiss.
Fred, really good to see you.
How are you?
How's Baltimore?
l hear it's quite a little town, eh?
Was it hot enough for you?
How about all those dead toads?
Well, what's for dinner, hon?
l hope it's that mock pot roast again.
What she can do with a cracker.
Watch out.
Let's see in here.
Another big kiss.
He seems fine to me.
Almost normal.
But that's the problem.
He's too normal.
Mayonnaise.
l can't get enough of it.
Really good to see you, Fred.
He used to say ""na-no, na-no.
"" Oh, none of that immigrant talk for me, hon.
- Hey.
You got a haircut.
- l got them all cut.
My broker told me that one.
Oh, what a mind, what a mind.
Well, Fred, how do you like this new suit?
Yeah, l was just admiring it.
l have one just like it.
Doesn't everyone?
What kind of a host am l?
Some kind of bozo.
Can l get you a cocktail?
How about a little Campari and Tab?
How about that?
lt's incredible.
No, no, no.
No, thanks, Mork.
- lt's not Mork anymore, Fred.
- Wait till you hear this.
lt's too ethnic.
Call me Morrie.
A spaceman named Morrie.
l'm working with children now, Fred, at a daycare centre, you know, because l think they're the future of America, tomorrow's Republicans.
Daycare centre.
That sounds interesting.
Well, it's a start, Fred.
Besides, we've got our future to think about, right, hon?
Right, Morrie.
Morrie.
Oh, Minnie.
Morrie and Minnie.
Sounds like something you'd see on the TV, doesn't it?
- Do you play canasta, Fred?
- Canasta?
Mindy, l wouldn't worry about this fella.
You know, l used to think you were strange and peculiar, but now, gosh, you're just like one of us.
Yeah, but, Daddy, he never does Orkan things anymore.
Like, he completely stopped drinking with his finger.
That's an old-planet custom, hon.
And l've also stopped spitting with my toe.
Besides, who wants a lot of drool in your socks?
Well, l've gotta be getting home.
Cathy is fixing a meat loaf for dinner tonight.
My favourite.
Here's a little tip for you, Fred: Try it with ketchup.
Hey, how about tomorrow, maybe you and l will play a little golf?
- Well, l'd like that.
- And we'll talk about some politics.
Do you really think that Earl Scheib does Ronald Reagan's hair?
Honey, goodbye.
And trust me, everything is gonna be all right.
lt's gonna be wonderful.
l'll see you on the first tee.
Fore.
Oh, Mindy, now l understand where you inherited your zest for life.
l think l'll just relax, watch a little TV.
- Can l talk to you for a minute, Mork?
- Oh, not right now, hon.
Merv's gonna sing ''My Way'' underwater with an Aqua-Lung with Jacques Cousteau.
l'd like to see Phil Donahue do that.
Well, it's kind of important.
See, it's sort of been building up for the last couple of weeks.
l don't really know how to put this into words, but you've just changed so much.
- Now, hon-- - You're just like an Earthling.
- Oh, big kiss.
- No.
l'm just afraid that there's something going wrong between us.
Oh, what can go wrong, hon?
We've got the whole night planned out here.
Look, we'll start off with That"s IncredibIe!
And tonight Bo Derek is gonna try to count to ten.
Oh, look.
On Lou Grant, he's gonna change his shirt.
Watch out.
Oh, and on Quincy, ''Quincy falls in love during an autopsy.
'' Well, that's a dead giveaway.
Big kiss.
Mind?
Mind, hon.
Kitten, what you doing up?
What's wrong, Mind?
Mind, you're crying.
You used to say, ''Your eyes are leaking.
'' l did?
Oh, Mork, when you first came to Earth, you were so exciting, so different and special.
But l think that l've ruined all that.
Oh, no, l'm still the same.
See?
No, it's my fault.
l'm the one who told you not to act strange in public and not to sit on your face or not to feed the pigeons with a fork.
Oh, that was great, Mind.
You taught me a lot.
Oh, Mork, don't you see?
l taught you too much.
l've created an Earthling.
Yeah, l guess that's me, Morrie Q. Public.
Because of me, you've lost everything that made you so wonderful.
You think so, hon?
Oh, Mork, we've got a big problem.
l've had to make a really tough decision.
l don't think you should live here anymore.
- You don't?
- No.
Maybe if you're out on your own, that special quality might come back.
There's gotta be something we can do.
l mean, there must be someone who can help us.
There's no one on Earth who's even gonna believe us.
Wait.
There is one person.
There is someone who can help us.
Stick your finger in my ear.
- l beg your pardon?
- No, no, Mind.
l mean we're gonna talk to Orson, you and l both.
But first, l've gotta plug you into my mind, so stick your finger in my ear, hold my nose.
You mean l'm gonna go with you into your head?
- lnto your mind?
Can l do that?
- Well, there's plenty of room.
Oh, this is very strange.
Well, you should have seen the old way.
Hold on.
Mork calling Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Now, l think that's how it goes, yeah.
Come in, big buddy.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
l mean, who'd ever believe this?
l'm inside an actual head.
lt just doesn't seem possible.
But here l am, Mindy McConnell, who's never even been to New York.
SiIence.
- Somebody else is in here.
- Oh, it's just Orson.
See?
Sir, l brought my friend Mindy to talk to you.
An EarthIing in your mind?
This is highIy unusuaI, Mork.
l know that, sir, but it's very important.
l couldn't do it by myself.
l seem to be losing my Orkan-ness.
Tell him, hon.
Hi, sir.
- Orson.
- Orson.
- Sir.
Obesity.
- Sir.
- No.
- No.
See, the problem seems to be that Mork has been around me so much, he's He's become too much of an Earthling.
Is that true, Mork?
- Yes sirree, bob.
- This is very serious.
It sounds Iike you"re affIicted with observer syndrome.
What's that?
It can happen when an observer spends too much time on another pIanet.
He starts to become Iike the creatures there.
UnIess Mork can be cured, he"II have to be ostracised.
Ostracised?
Does that mean, like, cast out?
He wiII be returned to Ork, where he wiII be stripped of his name, his honour and his uniform.
Then he wiII be sprayed purpIe and doomed to wander his homeIand forever as a faIIen Orkan.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, it's awful, Mind.
No one ever talks to you when you're purple, and the police always hassle you.
- What have l done?
- Perhaps irreparabIe harm.
- But you said there was a cure.
- PossibIy.
I"II have to arrange for Mork to be visited by the most exaIted eIder on Ork.
He is very oId and very wise, and he knows aII there is to know about Orkan cuIture.
If anyone can possibIy retrain Mork in Orkan ways, it"s the Ancient One.
lt's gotta work, sir.
l don't wanna be purple.
Orson signing off.
Well, goodbye, sir.
- That's ""na-no, na-no.
"" - Really?
I wiII teII the eIder to pack quickIy.
That's right, Dad, you heard it.
l was inside Mork's mind, and l actually talked to Orson.
Well, yeah, he said that he's gonna send down an elder.
Yeah, a very wise and very old man who's gonna try to teach Mork how to get back to the way he was.
lf it doesn't work, they're gonna paint him purple and l'll never see him again.
He's at work at the daycare centre.
lt might be the last time he gets to see his little friends.
All right, little neighbours, let's gather round the neighbourhood.
Come on, here we go.
Let's go sit around Mr. Table.
We have another story today.
l'm sorry about yesterday's story.
That was one by Stephen King, and naptime didn't go very well, did it?
Okay, today we have kind of a fable.
That's kind of a funny story.
Once, a long time ago in a faraway land-- Maybe even a planet, l don't know.
Let's just leave it at that.
--there lived a little fuzzy creature named Crom.
And he lived in a little hole, kind of like a condominium.
And one day, a big fuzzy lump-lump came and knocked on the door and said, ''You have to leave.
'' So, what did you say?
- How'd you know it was me?
- Because you're fuzzy.
You got me.
l'll give it to you straight from the hip.
l've got problems, real problems, and l need your help.
- We'll help you.
- Yeah, we always do.
Let it out, big guy.
lt's eating you up.
Thanks, Lola.
All right.
Well, it's - lt's Mindy.
- l knew it, girl troubles.
Girls are always trouble.
Put a snake in her bed.
Show some sensitivity.
The man's got grief.
Yeah.
Well, see, Mindy wants me to leave, and l don't want to.
Leave?
Why would you have to leave?
Well, it's kind of like You know when you put pudding in the icebox for a long time and it gets real hairy?
Forget that one.
And don't tell Mommy and Daddy l told you that one either.
Okay.
Well, l used to be one way, and now l'm something different.
Kind of like when root beer goes flat, you know?
Well, l wanna find out, well, how l was.
- l don't understand.
- Me either.
When do we eat?
Not now, Stephanie.
Uncle Morrie has the floor right now.
Stuff it.
We'll have to pluck a lot of the petals off your courtesy flower.
Basically, l want to find out, well, what l was like before.
We'd like to help you, Mork, but we don't know how you was.
Yeah, we just met you when you came to work here.
l know.
Why don't you ask Mindy what you used to be like?
Well, l did, and l can't see how anybody could be like that and not be coming in on three engines.
You could find out what you were like from other people who knew you before.
- You mean, like, ask my friends?
- Of course.
One person isn't an accurate sampling.
Poll your friends for an in-depth profile.
That's an excellent idea, Lola.
l Can l ask you one question?
Are you dating Walter Cronkite?
Good Iuck, Ancient One.
You are Mork"s onIy hope.
Well, how do you like the place?
Did you catch the sign out front?
DaVinci's.
l named it for us.
- Tell them your new slogan, Remo.
- Sure, sis.
DaVinci's Restaurant: Have your last supper here.
- That's really artful.
- Thanks.
- Where do you get those ideas?
- Yeah, well.
l have a problem.
l'm taking a little opinion poll.
Do you remember what l was like before?
You don't wanna know that.
Well, l always thought you were fun, kind of unpredictable, silly.
- Goofy.
- Remo.
No, no, l meant nice goofy.
Oh, l see.
Goofy with a side of nice.
- A little restaurant humour.
- Yeah.
Hi, Nelson.
Table for one?
Well, actually, l'm supposed to meet a friend here, the Widow Comstock.
A woman in black?
She was sitting right here.
- l think she's in the washroom.
- That's her, poor thing.
She misses her late husband so very much.
- She's in mourning.
- Oh, no.
l've got a woman weeping in my new bathroom.
Nelson, can you help a friend in need?
Sure, Mork.
Come, let us sit together.
Thank you.
Nelson, l'd like to get back to my former self.
l mean, the way l was.
l mean, you did it.
- What's the secret?
- l had to.
Losing that election showed me what kind of a shallow person l was.
So l joined this group that's teaching me to think positive and feel good about myself.
Oh, Nelson, here l am.
Mork, l'd like you to meet the Widow Comstock.
- Hi, Mork.
- Hi, Wid.
Oh, that's cute.
Nobody's ever called me Wid before.
But then, l've only had the title for a few months.
You see, we were assigned to each other from the group.
Kind of like the buddy system.
She reminds me to think positive, and l remind her not to feel grief.
Oh, l see.
You buoy up the girl.
Nelson has given me the moral strength to go on after my husband, Randolph Yes, yes, yes.
Thank you, Nelson.
lt's been a tortured four months.
But Randolph made me promise that if he ever went before me, l would never lose that special sparkle he cherished so much.
The skiing, the sailing, the mariachis at midnight.
What's the matter?
Your face.
There's something about it that reminds me of Randolph.
Oh, is this one better?
Oh, l don't mind being reminded.
ln fact, every day, l wear black in memory of him.
- That's why l'm wearing this.
- Was that one of his?
Mork, this brave woman has truly inspired me with her spontaneous vitality.
You're spontaneous.
That's what Mindy wants from me.
She want-- Are you really spontaneous?
Oh, l don't know.
Nelson, let's skip dinner and dune-buggy to the border.
Yes.
That's it.
Let's see, we've got weird, unpredictable, goofy with a side of nice, yes.
Oh, no wonder Mindy misses me.
Well, l'm gonna get ready now.
New Mork, new Mork That's it.
l've got to tell her.
New Mork, new Mork.
- Mork, what are you doing?
- Waiting up for you, hon.
- What?
- Oh, nothing, titter, titter.
l'm just being a little silly, unpredictable, wild and goofy, like my friends said l used to be.
Here.
Here's a little goofy: Mindy, how come you only have three fingers?
Mork, are you trying to--?
No, no, Mindy, you haven't seen spontaneous yet.
Mind, let's take a bus all the way to Denver and have a lot of daiquiris.
- Come on.
- No, Mork.
Mork, Mork, Mork.
Oh, Mork.
Mork, this isn't you.
Don't you see?
You're being too obvious.
- lt's not gonna fool the elder.
- Yeah.
And you don't have to perform for me.
l'm your friend.
l just wanna try to help you to find your old self.
Yeah, but l guess l've run out of places to look, Mind.
l'm just sorry l couldn't be grateful for what l had.
l'm sorry l let it get away.
Oh, Mork, l don't want you to be purple.
What a strange thing to say to somebody.
What's that?
Either Led Zeppelin's playing nearby, or he's here.
- The elder?
- Yeah.
- The Ancient One is here.
- Mork, what do l say?
How do l act?
Just be very respectful to the old coot.
Okay.
lt's all right, remain calm, remain calm, remain calm.
Stop your moving.
What's happening?
Mind, he's older than l thought.
Your Eminence.
Your Eminence, he who knows all.
He's speaking some kind of foreign language, Mind.
- l think it's Orkan.
- Oh, of course.
- What's he saying?
- l was hoping you'd know.
- Does he speak English?
- l'll ask him.
Do you speak English?
Perhaps he didn't hear you.
Please.
l can speak any language l choose.
Mork, l don't get it.
You said somebody very old was coming.
How old are you?
Seven microbIeams, or in Earth years, eighty-six.
Eighty-six?
He looks like a 1 0-year-old kid.
On Ork, the aging process is reversed.
lt's kind of like Dick Clark.
You see, we are born in a test-tube, fully grown, grey-haired and wrinkled.
That way, we are treated with respect from day one.
And baby-shoe bronzing is really expensive.
Now, as we grow older, we start to look younger.
We get smaller and cuter.
And that way, all the people wanna keep their old folks at home.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
ln a weird sort of way.
- Let's get on with the training.
- Oh, all right.
According to the metre, you're only 1 7 percent Orkan.
Mork, if you are not a full Orkan by the time l am finished here, you will be ostracised.
Oh, no.
The disgrace, the shame and the shande of it all.
To be purple.
To be purple in winter too.
Purple doesn't go well with goose bumps.
ls there anything l can do to help?
You've done enough, culture sapper.
- Go away.
- What?
Wait a minute, buster, this is my house.
- Who do you think you are?
- My name is: - l beg your pardon?
- l think he said his name was: - What a rude planet.
- You turned him into an Earthling.
Now, leave us alone so l can put the Ork back in Mork.
- She meant no harm, Your Eminence.
- She robbed us of an Orkan.
Oh, Mork, he's right.
l guess l have done enough already.
l'll just go back and wait in the room.
Good luck.
- Big kiss.
- Not now.
- l feel really bad for her, sir.
- Orkans do not have feelings, infidel.
Now, we shall begin with something basic.
- Hit your head against that wall.
- Right.
l do not know any Libyans, and l have not yet cashed the cheques.
- How did l do?
- lncorrect.
You did not say ""shazbot.
"" Again.
Howard, l lost.
lt was my thyroid.
Wrong.
Pain first, ""shazbot"" second.
Right.
l can see why you're the elder.
Again.
Let's move Laverne and ShirIey to Thursday night, okay?
Try it again.
You mean there's really another Orkan up there?
Yeah.
Oh, Dad, it's crazy.
They've been unloading a whole fleet of cargo eggs and taking strange-looking stuff into the attic.
You're living with two Orkans?
Oh, Dad, if Mork fails his Orkan training, l'll never forgive myself.
He'll make it, honey.
He's doing it for you.
You watch.
Soon he'll be the same fella who used to lie on the lawn, shampooing caterpillars.
Well, l just feel so helpless.
l mean, he's going through so much, and l can't even be up there with him.
- Why not?
- Because that old coot won't let me.
Well, honey, if Mork needs you, maybe you should be up there to help him.
Well, yeah.
But l feel like an intruder in my own house.
And who knows what's even arriving in those eggs?
You sound like you're a little scared.
l am, but l'm scared for Mork, not for me.
l mean, he just might fail that test.
Well, it never hurts to bring an apple to the teacher, if you know what l mean.
Yeah.
lf you want me to, l'll go up there with you.
No.
No, thanks, Dad.
He's my alien.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, l'm sure.
Okay, well, l guess l can go, then.
All right.
Now, look, if you need me, l'll be home hiding under the bed.
Bye.
Stop.
lt's a pure Orkan environment up there, and you're not going to spoil it.
Listen: See, you and l have gotta have a little talk.
Now, l care about Mork, and l want him to be Orkan again just as badly as you do.
l mean, l think Orkans are great.
They're terrific.
But you just gotta let me help him.
Do you understand?
- Pardon me.
- l can't take this excitement.
l'm not a young man anymore.
- All right, you may go.
- Thank you.
But you must not contaminate what we have up there with your Earthliness.
Put this on.
- ls this gonna fit me?
- One size fits all.
Yeah.
Well, l'll be back there, putting it on.
Up the stairs, down the stairs.
This planet's rough on old people.
Oh, hello.
You must be one of Mork's little friends from the daycare centre.
What's your name?
Listen, you little Leave here at once.
This is no place for children.
- What are you, a wise guy?
- Very.
How would you like to go for a ride in my Cuisinart?
How do l look?
Hi, Mr. Bickley.
Listen, l came up here to complain about the noise.
Can't you play dress-up a little more quietly?
Where'd you get your outfits?
Frederick's of Mars?
They're cute at that age.
Let us go.
But l must warn you, your upper level has been transformed into a world no Earthling has ever seen before.
What's happening, my man?
Looking good.
- l don't believe this place.
- Quiet.
He's on the na-no machine.
- Hi, Mork.
- Hi, Mind.
Wrong.
Big na-no, Mind.
He's firm, but he's fair.
Oh, you look good in Orkan threads.
l didn't know they made them in cadet.
What's happened to this place?
You'd never even know we were in the attic.
Oh, gribIitch means he's on a break, Mind.
Those elders have a tough union.
Well, let me show you around.
- Wow, it's really fantastic.
- Shucks.
What's that?
What's that thing?
That was Orkan words of wisdom.
lt'll come around again.
See, here it says: Which means, ''Life is like a Kusshhbaya.
"" - Deep, huh?
- Yeah, l'll bet.
Let me show you a picture of where l grew up.
You mean this is what Ork looks like?
Well, some of it.
They tore most of it down to make swamps when they found out earthquakes were an allergic reaction to condominiums.
lt's even prettier in the fall.
lt comes so quickly too.
You too.
There it goes.
- That is amazing.
- Well, the artist is really fantastic.
You should see one of his sunsets.
Here comes one now.
Look at that.
Listen, Mind.
Crickets.
Those are the three moons of Ork: Lumpy, Squeezy and Jo-Jo.
Oh, Mork, are all these things helping you to become more Ork-like?
Oh, they sure are.
They all remind me of things back home, especially my pet noggachomp.
Well, noggachomps are the number-one pet on Ork, even more popular than cocker frenkIes.
Mine's the cutest little one of all.
Here, let me call him.
Bebo, come here, boy.
Come here, Bebo.
- l think he likes you, Mind.
- Yeah, as a friend or a munchy?
No, don't worry, hon.
They only eat hair and rugs.
That's why political candidates on Ork have to be real careful.
- Well, call him off.
- Oh, okay.
Here, Bebo.
l don't know whether he's coming or going most times.
He's gonna dance with me.
l missed you, boy, l missed you.
- Oh, it's a boy?
- l don't know.
l've never had the nerve to turn him over.
Yes, Your Eminence?
Break's over, Mind.
Take a hike, Bebo.
- Next phase.
- Sir.
You will relearn your Orkan pledge of allegiance.
Put your hand over your hearts.
l pledge allegiance to my planet.
The rest of the known universe can can it.
- Mork.
- What's happening?
- What's happening?
- What was that?
Killer Naugahyde.
We call it the sizzler.
lt probably thought you were a Malibu chicken.
lt was really hot.
- lt was like it was trying to fry me.
- That's all right.
You can only sit down if you have asbestos shorts.
- You're safe now, though, Mind.
- Get away from him.
But she needs me, sir.
Yeah, wait a minute, you don't under-- Mind?
Mind?
She checked out and took the baggage too.
You froze her.
You're more concerned about her than you are about being an Orkan.
lt's no use.
Your training can't help you.
You're going back to Ork now.
- No, sir, l can't leave Mind.
- You must.
After all these years, you'll never know that l said goodbye.
Big kiss.
No, sir, l can't leave Mind.
We'll build you another one, a more advanced model with a power seat.
No, no, no, sir.
See, there will never be another Mindy.
You underestimate technology.
We must go.
No, sir, you don't understand.
Mindy's-- Blasphemy.
An elder understands everything.
You young people have no respect.
l meant no disrespect, Your Fogyness.
lf l can only show you what a Mindy is, l'll kiss your tiny feet through your sensible boots.
All right, but be quick about it.
See what's different is that she has qualities that we Orkans don't have.
Sometimes she's happy.
- Sometimes she's sad.
- Mork.
Sometimes she's fun-loving.
Oh, you kid.
Sometimes she's inquisitive.
Mork, how did you get your tongue through the keyhole?
But most of the time, she's caring.
She's caring.
She's really caring.
- ls something stuck?
- Yes, sir.
Me on Mindy.
Strange concept, yet it has such a hold on you.
Well, sir, you see, that's why l've got to be an Orkan, sir, so l can stay here with her.
l mean, she means more to me than anything in the known universe.
l mean, is there anything we can do?
There must be something.
Well, there is.
No, it's far too dangerous.
Oh, sir, l'll risk anything.
l'd even shave with a live weasel.
l haven't done it in many bIeams.
lt's horrendous.
lt's terrifying, a last resort.
l'm too old even to consider it.
But maybe with her help - What happened?
- With her help, l can possibly do it.
Do what?
There's a remote possibility that l might be able to pull the Earth spirits from your body with the Ritual of the Sacred Eggs.
The Ritual of the Sacred Eggs, Mind.
Oh, gasp, choke.
Extreme fear.
Everything pulses through my body.
Mind, he's an ''eggsorcist.
'' With this ceremonial egg, l will attempt to remove the Earth spirits from his body.
- l only hope l'm strong enough.
- Why?
What's gonna happen?
lt's not going to be pleasant.
Wouldn't you feel more powerful if you were upstairs, in your own environment?
No, we must fight the Earth vibrations off where they're most powerful.
That's why it's so dangerous.
Earth behaviour, begone.
- Oh, Mork, are you all right?
- Mork's not here right now.
Morrie's the name, Earth creature's the game.
What do you mean, my credit's no good, Lord?
Your grandma writes bad cheques at Macy's.
The Earth spirits won't let go of him.
l must try harder.
- Begone.
- Get that thing away from me.
The next time you get that near me, there'd better be pantyhose in there.
Why?
What are you doing?
You're a gnarly little geek, aren't you?
No, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, for sure, for sure.
- Begone.
- For sure, for sure, for sure.
- Begone.
- Mom, get me a Twinkie.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty.
There goes the kitty.
No.
Hey, nice to be here in Vegas.
Nice to be here in Vegas.
Goodnight.
l know what to say.
Hey, are you sure?
You wanna go for a ride?
No, come here.
l don't know, l don't care.
Where would this country be without this great land of ours?
l don't know.
l'm sorry.
All l want is a condominium with a view, a condominium with a view.
l shall return.
l shall return.
- Begone, begone.
- l shall return.
They're just tapes, they're just tapes.
Hide them, hide them, hide them.
Auntie Em, Auntie Em.
Well, do something.
l can do no more.
lt's up to him now.
Oh, no.
Oh, Mork, please come back.
Mork?
Mork.
- My name is Mork from Ork.
- He's back.
The Earthly spirits seem to have left.
Let me help you up.
Are you all right?
Oh, Mind, l had this horrible dream.
l dreamed my head spun all the way around and l spit out Linda Blair.
Let me help you.
Let me get this off.
Look, your hair's growing.
l'm back to my roots.
l'm back to my-- Thank you, Your Geezerness.
He's just the way he used to be, right?
The Ork-o-metre will tell us that.
There's no place like home.
Only 93 percent Orkan.
You failed.
Prepare to leave for Ork to be ostracised.
Oh, no, it can't be.
No, Mind, we cannot question the wisdom of an elder.
- Can we?
- No.
See?
Mind, something's knocked theout of: Mind, he said the ritual would be dangerous, and yet he still did it for me.
- And you did it for me.
- Oh, and you did that for him.
You know, life would be a lot simpler if we were selfish.
Let's see if we can get him to drink some juice.
Here.
Let me, sir.
There we go.
- Oh, yeah, l forgot.
- lt's all right.
He's not drinking.
Maybe l should fix him some soup.
No, no, the noodles would get caught in his fingernails.
Oh, good, he's drinking.
- What's he saying?
- lt's Orkan for: He'd like a frozen daiquiri, and what's your sign?
l was about to take Mork away, and you wanted him to stay.
Why did you help me?
l had to.
You needed someone.
As a wise elder, l have never uttered these words before: l don't get it.
Well, it's lt's called caring, Your Eminence.
Strong medicine.
l think l'm beginning to realise what a Mindy is.
Well, at least you understand that, sir.
l'm ready to leave now.
- You're not a perfect Orkan.
- Spare me.
And the rules say l must take you back.
- Rules are rules, sir.
- True.
But you are not playing the same game down here.
- You both taught me that.
- l don't understand.
Puzzlement, a sense of disorientation, sir.
Perhaps if you were any more Orkan, you'd be of no use as an observer.
- You'd stick out.
- Yeah.
Like me.
You belong here.
- You mean he can stay?
- Yes, oh, soft-lapped one.
Thank you, sir.
Jubilation, ''shiksalation.
'' Oh, fern.
Fern, l'm back.
You too.
Look at it.
l'm back, jack.
Take it easy, chair.
Sorry, sir.
Thank you, Your Eminence.
l liked that.
- That was called a hug.
- lnteresting concept.
Why don't we have them on Ork?
Either we're too advanced, or we don't want the Baptists to know that we're dancing.
l must go now in order to catch the next time warp.
But if l should ever happen to be in the galaxy again, would you mind a visit from an old man?
- Any time.
- We promise we'll write.
Yeah, as soon as we learn how to spell: Well, na-no, na-no, or as you Earthlings say: Goodbye.
Well, it's nice to have you back, Mork.
Just Mindy and me And Bebo makes three Mork.
Mork.
Oh, enjoy him now, Mind.
They grow to be a hundred feet high.
He likes you, Mind.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Come in, Your Grossness, Your Fattitude, Your lnner Tubeness, oh, lard and master.
- Oh, how I missed those words, Mork.
- Sir, me too.
GIad to see you"re back.
l'd be glad to see your back, sir, but your front folds around and covers it.
l love to zing him, Bebo.
Music to my ears.
His Eminence toId me what happened.
It must have been quite an experience for you.
Oh, yes, sir.
lt was a very heavy philosophical excursion, for sure.
Basically, sir, after much difficulty, l found the tree of me.
- Good, Mork.
Where did you find it?
- ln the Forest of Us, sir.
And where is the Forest of Us?
Well, down the path of change, where the squirrels of self hide the nuts of inner peace.
In other words, Mork, what you"re saying is Iife is Iike a Kusshhbaya?
Yes, sir, yes.
Come on home, Mama, take anything you need.
Basically, sir, l'd like to thank you, Mind, littleand everyone who made me an Orkan again, sir, because that's the way l really wanna be.
- I"m gIad to hear that, Mork.
- Oh, me too, sir.
Because l learned a very important lesson.
You can make your home anywhere in the universe, but it's most comfortable if you furnish it with your own traditions.
And l feel best in Early Mork.
Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 3}
You think the mail's here?
l'm expecting something.
Oh, if it's important, say no more.
Neither wind nor sleet nor slush will stop me.
l'll fetch it.
Boy, that was quick.
Oh, hi, Glenda Faye.
Hi, Mindy.
Why was Mork scratching his ear with his foot?
Oh, well, when he fetches the mail, he does it with total commitment.
Well, how about a little morning jog?
Oh, l don't know.
How far you going?
- Denver.
- Denver?
No, thanks, Glenda Faye.
l think that maybe some other time.
l wish l could stop by more often.
You know, l really don't have too many people to talk to since my husband passed on.
Well, you know, l was sorry to hear about your loss.
There will never be another Randolph.
That's why every day, l wear something black in memory of him.
Denver is pretty far.
How about a doughnut?
We can go to the House of Holes.
No, l can't.
l'm waiting for the results of a scholarship exam l took for journalism grad school.
Oh, l hope l get it.
Well, l'm sure you did.
You were always so smart in high school.
l envied you.
You envied me?
Well, you were the one that was out having all the fun.
Well, l envied you between the fun.
Don't worry, Mindy.
You're gonna get that scholarship.
Oh, l wish l could be as positive as you.
Well, hasta la vista.
That wasn't a new vase, was it?
No.
No, it's been in the family for generations.
Oh, good.
Now, don't you worry, l'm gonna replace it.
Bye, boy.
Have Mindy give you a little treat later.
Mail call!
Let me see here.
''McConnell, Mindy.
'' ls there anything about my scholarship?
l don't know.
Nothing really smells scholastic.
Let me see, let me see.
Nothing.
l should have heard by now.
When are those guys gonna let me know?
Oh, there's something in here for you.
Here.
''Can you come visit me?
Your friend, Pete--'' lt's from Peter, my pen pal.
He wants me to visit him.
Oh, come on, Mindy.
He lives outside of Boulder.
Can you go?
Maybe?
Maybe?
Oh, Mork, maybe some other time.
l don't think l'd be too much fun today.
Oh, Mind, maybe your scholar boat will come tomorrow.
That's ''scholarship.
'' Oh, l guess l'm just a little ''dinghy,'' huh?
ls Mork here yet?
Anybody seen my pen pal?
No, and we never will.
Come on, that guy ain't gonna show up.
When are you gonna face facts and grow up?
But Mork will come.
l trust him.
Come on, you can't trust anybody.
Look at me.
My wife is in real estate.
One day, she said she found the perfect home for me.
l've been here ever since.
Peter, guess what.
My friend Mork is here.
That's very good.
See, Sid?
l told you he'd show.
l'll get the confetti.
Mork?
Peter?
Mork.
Peter.
Morko.
Pedro.
Oh, my little pen pal, quill buddy, paper mate.
Oh, this is some swell kind of place.
They gave me a tour.
lt was incredible.
l mean, that rubber wallpaper, wow, how convenient.
And then those coats too.
You can hug yourself all day.
lt's wonderful.
Look at that, industrial-strength screen.
You must have some big sucker mosquitoes out there.
The type that are on steroids, they're going, ''Here, l'm coming.
'' That's wonderful.
Hey, this is my kind of town.
ls this guy crazy?
He belongs in this place more than l do.
Oh, gee, thanks.
- l think your friend really likes me.
- l'm not his friend and l don't like you.
lt's okay, Mork.
Sid's a little depressed.
Hey, hey.
Let's play some games.
We've got cards, checkers.
Hey, we could even play some jacks.
Oh, l love playing jacks, especially Jack Nicholson.
We took a vote and l wanna see the damn World Series.
Hey, Sid.
Come on, join us.
- lt's fun.
- Buzz off.
Oh, Mork, it's so sad.
You know, people don't wanna play around here anymore.
But l'm working on them.
Well, my friend Mindy's like that too.
She's been real sad recently.
l don't know why people are unhappy when there's so many clowns in government.
They're unhappy because they grew up.
But l thought you have to grow up so you can feel guilty and be an adult.
You may have to grow tall, but you don't have to grow up.
- Can you keep a secret?
- Sure.
You know that--?
Does he have one wheel in the sand?
Well, what's your secret?
l'm Peter Pan.
Peter Pan?
But you sign all your letters Peter Panovski.
Oh, that's just a cover.
Nobody's left out there that believes in Peter Pan.
- Why not?
- See, l'm the real Peter Pan.
You know?
Oh, wait one millibleam.
You mean the Peter Pan who could fly, lost his shadow, was chased by Captain Hook, got swallowed by the alligator that had clock in his stomach?
- Yes.
- What's not to believe?
Oh, Mork, you believe it's me.
You believe in me.
Oh, wait.
Wait one minute there.
l'm not just some shucker.
Come on now.
Wait a minute.
Peter Pan was a boy who never grew up.
Oh, that's me.
The little guy's still inside.
Oh, and it sounds like he's got gas.
Oh, Mork, you've made my day.
Oh, who am l kidding?
You made my life.
Somebody believes in me.
Where l come from, everybody believes in you.
- Oh, where's that?
- Well, it's l come from a place far, far away, where the plants are as intelligent as the people and the sky is yellow and brown.
Pittsburgh?
No.
What would you say if l told you l come from a planet called Ork?
l'd say, ''Welcome.
'' At last.
You know, where we come from, we say, ''Na-no, na-no.
'' Oh, what does that mean?
Well, it's a lot nicer than the old greeting.
- Which was?
- ''Yo, lizard thighs.
'' l love laughter.
You know, l tried to get everyone to laugh here at least once a day.
Sid's two years behind.
My friend Mindy's the same way.
She's so depressed recently.
See, that's why l came and got you so we could both make her happy.
lt's been a long time since l've been out there.
You know, it's scary.
Hey, don't worry, because you're with me.
l'm your pen pal.
We'll fight them off with a couple of quills.
You're right.
Okay, let's go.
Peter, aren't you forgetting something?
Oh, yeah.
What's the matter, Pete?
l'm sorry, Mork.
l can't go home with you.
Why not?
The house is pretty clean and l make a great hot fudge tortilla.
You don't understand.
l can't leave.
lt's against the rules.
Okay, everybody, it's time.
Pete, l mean, you gotta come.
l'm-- But-- - Leave it to me, leave it to me.
- Peter?
Ma'am, you don't understand, you see, Peter has to come home with me and see Mindy.
Oh, l'm sorry, but this is where he belongs.
Gee, Mork.
l'd like to help Mindy, but l can't.
Will you come visit me soon?
Sure.
Ma'am, how come he can't get out?
You have to understand, Mork, they must be locked in at night for safety.
Oh, so they don't bump their wings.
Yes, this too is true.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Julie.
What?
You got a scholarship?
Well, how sweet and thoughtful of you to call and tell me.
Anybody else get one?
Who?
The Rebozo twins?
Well, that makes me twice as happy.
Gee, Julie, thanks for calling me and giving me all the good news.
Thanks.
Bye.
Thanks for the ride, Mrs. Rebozo.
And congratulations to the twins.
Yeah, two heads are better than one.
Oh, how we feeling?
Terrible.
l seem to be the only one who hasn't heard about the scholarship.
lt's not looking good, Mork.
How was your day?
Did you have fun with Peter?
Oh, not bad.
- l have a question l'd like to ask you.
- Yeah?
Why do they lock some people up?
- Why do you ask?
- l don't know.
Why?
Why you paranoid?
l'm not paranoid, are you?
Well, l'm just a little curious about Earth customs, that's all.
Well, they usually lock people up because they commit crimes.
What if they didn't commit a crime?
Then they should be set free.
Wheels are turning.
A little justice must be done.
- Pardon me.
- No.
You see, Mork, sometimes life on Earth isn't always fair.
Oh, you mean like earthquakes demolish cities, floods wipe out homes.
The Rebozo twins get the scholarship.
l think l'll go lie down and count the sparkles in my ceiling.
Oh, poor Mind.
Adult life can really be tough sometimes.
lf only Peter Pan were here.
Wait a minute.
This is a job for Morky Bell.
Mork, Mork, maybe l shouldn't.
You know, it's against the rules.
No.
No, come on, see?
We're gonna break out, see?
Don't chicken on me, see?
Over the wall, see?
We're gonna get out of this pig house.
Now come on.
Mork, Mork, Mork, no.
Happy Valley isn't a prison.
lt's, you know, a funny farm.
Oh, you mean a place where they grow jokes.
No, no, no.
lt's where they put people who are different.
And people out there really think l'm different.
l don't know.
Maybe leaving isn't such a good idea.
Oh, no, come on.
Mindy needs you.
The world needs you.
Even Disneyland needs you.
But what if she turns out to be like all the others?
l put myself in here years ago because people didn't believe in me.
Why should she be any different?
Oh, she'll believe in you.
l mean, she believed that l came from outer space in an egg.
- She bought that?
- Yeah.
Come on, come on, Mindy needs you.
Let's go.
Wait a minute.
You're going out there?
You won't get more than 50 feet before some fink will rat on you.
Who would do a thing like that?
Me.
You see, you can't trust anybody.
l trust you, Sid.
Oh, Pete, you make it hard on a fink.
Maybe it's time l started trusting people out there.
Well, you mean you're gonna do it?
Let's go.
Oh, l love you, you big pixie.
Mork, Mork, what about the grill?
Step back.
Big deal.
Let's go.
lt might be faster if we flew.
A little for me.
Now think lovely thoughts and fly!
l think that fairy sold you some bum dust, Pete.
Mork, what is it?
Oh, Mind, Mind.
Don't worry about your troubles.
They've been tackled.
Sacked by ''Mean Mork'' Greene.
What are you talking about?
l haven't heard about the scholarship yet.
Oh, don't worry about that.
l got you something even better than the scholarship.
Peter, come on down.
Peter?
Your pen pal spent the night?
Yeah.
He's here right now.
What are you doing?
Quiet, Mind.
He understands.
Mindy McConnell, meet Peter Pan.
Oh, Peter Pan.
Any relation to the real Peter Pan?
Well, actually, l am the real Peter Pan.
And l bet you live in Never-Never Land.
No, l moved.
l now live in Happy Valley.
Happy Valley?
You mean, the ment?
The asyl?
Yeah.
Mork, can l talk to you for a minute?
Pardon me.
Mork, Mork.
We've got big trouble here.
- Right here in River City?
- No.
Mork, Peter has got to go back to Happy Valley.
l thought you said people don't have to be locked up.
No, you misunderstood.
Peter Pan isn't real.
lt's just a fairy tale.
l knew she wouldn't believe.
Oh, give her a chance, Pete.
Come on, Mind, you believe in me.
Why don't you believe in him?
Because you really are Mork from Ork and he's right here in my apartment.
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
Problems only seem big if that's all you look at in life.
- Yeah, but-- - Crow.
- Crow?
- Yes.
ln Never-Never Land, whenever we're feeling really good inside, we crow like a rooster.
Colonel Sanders, watch out, huh, Mind?
Come on, Mind.
Don't be all cooped up.
Take a flying chance.
No, Mork.
l don't think that l could possibly-- Oh, come on, Mindy.
You'll forget your worries in no time.
Listen, l appreciate what you're trying to do.
l do.
But l have to answer the phone.
- lt's no use.
- No.
Hello?
Oh, school.
Yes, this is Mindy McConnell.
No, l see.
You only have so many scholarships.
Right.
Maybe l'll try again next year.
No, no, no.
l'm not upset.
There's just one more thing, Dean Johnson.
l had a little frog in my throat.
Thank you for calling.
Oh, Mind, if you're ever gonna crow, you should have done it then.
l mean, you gotta let the little person out, like this: We should have gotten here sooner.
What's the matter?
Did Sid spill the peas?
No.
l found your letters from Mork, Peter.
And l had an idea you'd come here.
Fly, Peter, fly.
- Open the window first.
- No, Mork.
- Open the window.
- No.
No, Peter.
Don't jump.
l mean, don't fly away.
We need you, Peter.
You cheer people up so.
Even Sid misses you.
Sid misses me?
- And you know what he said?
- No.
What?
He said that you were his very best friend.
Oh, dear.
Mork, what should l do?
l don't know.
lt's up to you, kid.
Oh, l have to go back.
l mean, those people have problems, big problems, and l can help them.
Like the old saying, there's no place like the home.
l'll still be your pen pal.
l'm sorry, Mork.
lt didn't work.
Mindy's still sad.
Come on, Mind.
lf you ever had to crow, do it now.
For yourself, for Pete.
l can't.
l feel ridiculous.
You've been miserable.
What have you got to lose?
- Mork, l can't.
- Oh, Mindy, why don't you enjoy what you have instead of worrying about what you haven't?
Yeah.
Do it for me.
Well, do it for the little person inside of you.
No, Mork.
No, no.
Give it some gas, honey.
Give it some gas.
Again, with feeling.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Yes.
Yes.
You know, it really is crazy, but it does work.
lt really works.
l told you this guy was good, huh?
l told you.
Oh, Peter.
l believe in you.
Oh, l'm so glad.
Now, don't forget your crow.
l'll practise early in the morning so no one will get suspicious.
l can teach you how to do that too.
Oh, that's awful thoughtful of you, Peter.
Thank you.
Oh, Mork, thanks.
Oh, shucks.
l really do feel much better.
l really do.
Even though you didn't get the scholarship?
Well, you know, l've been thinking.
l don't need a degree to prove that l'm good enough.
l'll go out and get a job without it.
So what if it's a little scary?
Well Oh, Mork.
l forgot to say thank you.
Listen, l better get back.
They're looking for me around the corner.
See you next visiting day.
l don't believe it.
We're on the second floor.
He flew up here.
l know.
Did you help him do that?
Do you really wanna know?
- No.
- Me either.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Five, six, seven.
Come on, Bebo, follow the steps.
- Mork.
- Five, six, seven-- Yes, sir.
Why are you doing the Funky Orkan?
Well, sir, that's because l have a terminal case of Peter Panitis.
Peter Panitis?
What's that?
Sir, it's the only disease that's better than the cure.
You know, l found out this week that some people on Earth take life too seriously.
l mean, they worry too much.
- That's easy for you to say, Mork.
- Yes, sir.
You get to observe Earth and have fun while l'm on Ork doing all the work.
Oh, come on, Your Kvetchiness.
l mean, you can have fun anywhere.
There's a little child inside of all of us that needs to be let out.
See?
Hi, hi, how are you?
Come on, let him out.
All you have to do is a little of this.
Come on, try this: Oh, yeah.
Being silly doesn't change anything, Mork.
Oh, sir, come on.
Give it a try.
Just a crow, a little crow.
Croquette.
Enough of this nonsense.
- l have work to do.
- Aye, aye, sir.
That's the ancient version of ''arr, arr,'' sir.
Or ''aye, aye,'' sir.
That's the Christmas version of ''arr, arr.
'' But until next week, sir.
Come on, Beeb.
That's all right.
We failed.
Don't worry about it.
Crowing, how ridiculous.
l got you, sir.
l knew you'd try it.
l was just coughing, Mork.
Well, sir, one piece of advice.
Don't take anything for that cough.
Until next week, sir.
l knew there was a little person inside of all that fat, Bebo.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Thanks for driving me to work, Mind.
- Oh, hello, Mork, Mindy.
- Oh, hi.
l'm glad you're here early, Mork.
l have bad news.
Mr. Paul Simpson, the man we lease this daycare centre from, also owns the roller disco place across the street.
Our lease is up the end of the month, and Mr. Simpson isn't going to renew it.
He's going to tear down the daycare centre and make it a parking lot for the skating rink.
Oh, no, he can't do that.
What'll happen to our little munchkins?
They can't play hopscotch in the fast lane.
God only knows.
Mr. Simpson called, he's going to come over here this morning and explain things.
lf he appears, l'll be back in a second.
But Oh, Mork.
We better put our heads together.
Those kids are gonna be thrown out in the streets.
Yeah, l'll give that Mr. Simpson a piece of my mind, or at least a hunk of my frontal lobe there, Mind.
l mean, eviction of little munchkins, well, that's rude.
l mean, we can't be mean to kids.
Well, this isn't a Joan Crawford daycare centre.
You know, if it's the Paul Simpson, he's really a powerful man.
l mean, he owns half of Boulder.
Well, we'll just have to tell Mr. The Paul Simpson that he's dealing with Mork the Defender.
Oh, he's making my jaws tight, Mind.
lf l ever see him, l'm gonna give him what for.
- What five, give him what six.
- Excuse me.
- What six and a half.
- l'm Paul Simpson.
Oh, what for?
Oh, please, don't throw the little yodas out, Master Simpson.
Please, don't you understand?
l mean, you can't tear down the orphanage.
Little Orphan Annie and Oliver Twist will be thrown out in the cold picked up by Fagin and forced to lie, cheat and steal.
Then they'll take them to Hollywood and work in B movies.
They'll never have an agent.
- They'll never know-- - Mork.
Lighten up.
And it's not an orphanage, it's a daycare centre.
Who ever heard of Little Daycare Centre Annie?
You stay there.
Excuse me, Mr. Simpson.
But if you tear down the daycare centre, what'll the kids do when their parents go to work?
Oh, l don't wanna see this place torn down, but l'm not doing it, my son is.
Oh, you mean, you don't own the roller disco?
Well, technically, l do, but l bought the place and gave it to my son.
Can't you tell him not to tear this place down?
Oh, l have to let him do it his way.
He's always been irresponsible, a troublemaker.
The only thing he can do well is skate.
l bought that rink and gave it to him, hoping it would straighten him out.
lt seems to be working, so l'm not going to interfere.
l can understand your concern for your son, but what about all those little kids?
Well, l'm going to wait here for Mrs. Fowler.
Why don't you go down and talk to my son, Wheels?
Wheels?
ls that a family name?
His real name is Carroll.
For some reason, he prefers to be called Wheels.
Wow, that guy's really good.
Maybe.
l haven't been skating in such a long time.
l hope l don't fall down and hurt myself.
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, what's the big deal here?
We're not flying to the moon.
Just talking a little skating, a little gravity, a little friction.
Well, it's not that easy, Mork.
Have you ever done it?
Mindy, how hard can it be?
l mean, you got four wheels on each foot.
Ever seen an eight-wheeler tip over, a Peterbilt gono, boy.
Come on home, Mama, l'll take anything you need.
See?
Ta-da, no big deal.
Oh, no big deal.
You're walking on the carpet.
Mindy, l mean, we Orkans are born balancers.
l mean, we can waltz on water, we can tap dance on tapioca.
See this?
Watch out there.
We can also polka on the head of a pin.
You know, we-- Hey, hey, hey.
Okay.
Mind?
Mind, please help me get up.
Oh, Mork, you shouldn't balance on your nose.
l just don't understand how those eight-wheelers stay upright.
Good, here comes Wheels.
Why don't we catch him while he's alone?
That's all right, Mind.
l'm okay, l'm all right.
You go on, l just have a little cramp in my shoelace.
- l'll be okay, l'm a superior being.
- Okay.
Bye, Mind.
Oh, Mind.
Mind, Mind.
My name is Mindy McConnell, and l have a friend who'd like to talk to you.
Oh, where is your friend?
He can talk to me while l'm scraping up the gunk.
He's right here.
He's here somewhere.
Where could he be?
Would you get to the point?
Wheels is busy.
Here you go, sign there.
All right, but l'm not gonna sign it Carroll.
l'm signing it Wheels.
Well, see, l shouldn't be the one that talks to you about this, because Mork is the one who has the bone to pick.
Mork, come up here.
Oh, you must be Wheels.
And you must be Toes.
Oh, you kid.
Oh, actually, l'm Mork from the daycare centre.
You go to daycare centre?
Shoot, l was in jail at your age.
He works there.
l suppose you know the reasons why you shouldn't tear it down.
- Nope.
- Nope.
There's some kind of an echo here, Mindy.
But what about the children?
Oh, well, we'll try to get most of them out before we flatten the place.
Wait a minute here.
What kind of a human being are you?
What kind of a?
You big turkey, he doesn't even know how to skate.
Now, look, chicky poo, if you don't like the way l do business, you can get your perky little pigtails out of here.
Mind, Mind.
You sure l can't change your mind about that daycare centre?
You got about as much chance of that as you do of outskating me.
Mork, l'm gonna fall.
Okay, l accept your bet.
- What bet?
- Buddy.
Let go of me.
Will you let go of me?
Now, what bet?
Well, you said that if l beat you in skating, you'd change your mind.
Well, l accept your challenge, yup.
l didn't say that.
Oh, are we discoing to a different beat now, Mr. Thing?
Yeah?
You hear that, everybody?
Wheels the Professional says that he doesn't wanna race Mork the Beginner, huh?
Mind, he's quaking in his skates right now, isn't he?
Hey, Wheels, they're laughing at you.
Don't be silly, l'm not afraid of him.
Okay, l'll race him.
You hear that, everybody?
He accepts my challenge, Mind.
Mork, you can't beat him.
Mind.
Now, l am a superior alien being, remember that.
Okay, then let's get this straight.
lf Mork wins, then the daycare centre stays.
And if you win, it becomes a parking lot.
Hey, what difference is it gonna make anyway, huh?
How many laps around the rink, clown?
Clown?
No home rink advantage for you, no way.
Here comes the superior part, Mind.
Watch this.
This is the only rink in Boulder.
Where are you supposed to skate?
We're gonna skate the Rockies.
The Rocky Mountains?
- That's the superior part?
- Yeah.
We're gonna start up Eagle Point, skate down through Boulder Mountain Park, end up at the mall.
That's ten miles and steep.
And there might be snow.
Oh, a little: Are we writing a little cheque with our mouth that our feet can't cash maybe?
You don't know.
Are you in, big guy, or not?
l guess l'm in.
- All right, yeah.
- lt's my pride.
Saturday, high noon.
Be there or be square.
Mindy, we've got the oldest trick in the book.
- lt's in the solar system guidebook.
- Yeah?
Watch this one.
You're a rink skater.
But up there on the mountain where there's no strobe light, no disco beat and no spandex, we're equal.
Well, l gotta admire a guy that can put one over on me.
Wheels, why don't you let the smart guy read your belt buckle?
Sure, l enjoy a little light reading.
''Colorado State Rink Street Cross-Country Skate Champion.
'' Pretty.
You know, Mindy, Mork simply doesn't have a chance to win the race.
Oh, l agree.
He got up before dawn to start training.
That was six hours ago.
He seems to have a will, but there's no way.
l think l hear Rocky now.
Mork, what's wrong?
Oh, Mind, you see this finger?
Yeah.
That's the only part of my body that doesn't hurt.
And that's because l think it's a clean break.
Let me help you.
Look out.
Oh, Mork, just - Okay.
- Hello, Fred.
Mork, you look terrible.
l was all right, Fred, until l skinned my eyes.
Mind.
You'll never guess who l ran into, Mindy.
Who?
Well, you beat me, but no fair.
You took a shortcut through the rose hedge.
Oh, Dad, this is Glenda Faye Comstock.
We went to high school together.
Yes, yes.
l've always liked you, Mr. McConnell.
Oh, yes.
- Where'd you run into Glenda Faye?
- Well-- He ran into me here, then here, and a little later right down here.
Mindy, do you mind if l use your bathroom?
l'd like to powder my bruises.
Sure.
Excuse me.
Well, l really admire your spirit.
Six hours of training.
Where'd you go?
Well, Mind, you wouldn't believe this, but l went all the way around the block.
How many times?
Times?
Mork, you can't learn to skate like a professional in a week.
Oh, Fred, l've got to.
l mean, l've gotta do it for the kids.
And besides, l can't lose, no way.
Why can't you lose?
Well, because this is the land of the home, free of the brave.
Because the good guys always win, and that's me.
Oh, who says the good guys always win?
Oh, Fred, movies, television.
l mean, look at that.
l mean, it's the American way.
When's the last time you saw Genghis Khan ride off into the sunset?
All right, you little Mongols, head your little ponies up.
Or when's the last time you saw Peter Lorre ride off into the sunset?
Happy trails to you Until we meet again You're very pretty.
You see, it's determination.
Determination, it's the little skater who thought he could.
l think l can, l think l can.
Can, yes, l can, can, yes, l can.
See?
Determination, Fred, and that's what l've got lots of.
My middle name is Mr. D. Good afternoon, fellow Boulderites.
l'll be receiving reports throughout the course of the race by spotters using walkie-talkies.
And l see by the old watch on the wrist that the race is about to start.
Yes, our two daredevils should be getting ready to start the race right about now up at the top of Eagle's Peak.
- Now, you know your route.
- Okay.
You go down Oak Street, you turn onto Pearl, and then you go right into Boulder Mall.
Right into Boulder Mall.
Too bad they don't make those in loafers, huh, Mind?
Look at that helmet.
He looks like Amelia Earhart.
Hey, he's nothing.
- Watch out for the potholes.
- Potholes, yeah.
- And the ice, it's slippery.
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.
- Like that.
- Like that.
And keep your vest buttoned, you don't wanna catch cold.
Thanks, Mother Mind.
Hello, Wheels.
Hello, sleazy second.
Say hi to the warden.
l got everything we need in the van.
And l put them tyres where you told me to.
Good.
l know l can beat this turkey, but l don't wanna take any chances.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, Bozz, let's get this over with.
Good luck, Mork.
You can do it, l hope.
Sure l can, Mind.
And l've trained for a week.
On your mark, get set Oh, l forgot got to wish him good luck.
May the best - Excuse me, l - Go.
l think you better shoot that thing again.
He's a little far away, l don't think he heard it.
- What kind of a start was that?
- A nice clean start.
Get going.
Mork, go.
- Come on, go.
- l'm going.
Go, go.
l can do it.
The good guys always win.
Now, all it takes is a little total concentration.
Now, l can't let anything distract me.
Orson calling Mork.
Come in, Mork.
Not now, Orson, l'm busy.
l gotta get an unlisted head.
l wonder who left those tyres in the middle of-- Oh, no, someone could Where'd you come from?
Oh, a little spot called death's door.
l'd like to talk about the start of that race.
Where l come from, it's usually ready, set, bang, skate, not ready, set, skate, bang.
l know it's a very subtle difference, but Speaking of where'd you come from, how did you get beside those tyres?
What tyres?
What tyres?
l Rapidly mounting suspicions here.
l know there's something wrong, but l can't pinpoint it.
Look who caught up to Mr. Champion.
l'm glad, makes this easier.
Oh, hope l land on something soft.
l heard pine was a soft wood.
Oh, Mork.
Here, let me help you.
Take my arm.
l know.
- Give me a grab.
- Thank you.
Are you okay?
Mind, l thought the good guys always win.
Not when the bad guys cheat.
Yeah, but l don't wanna cheat.
l don't wanna do anything rash.
lf you won't be rash, how you gonna catch him?
Well, it's a drastic measure, but l could always induce translinear phasial-molecular motion.
Could you translate that into Earthling, please?
Well, basically it's a time warp, Mind.
But l can't do it for very long.
l don't know if l have time to catch him anyway.
At this point, you gotta try anything.
Oh, look who's telling me to cheat.
l'm not telling you to cheat.
He's the one that's cheating.
And anyway, you're doing it for the kids.
Yeah, the little munchkins.
You're right, Mind.
l'll see you at the finish line if l don't burn up on reentry.
- Big kiss.
- Okay.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, l Well, l can't catch him on the road, l'll have to take a shortcut.
Wait a minute, you're gonna skate down there through the grass?
He's skating through the grass.
Ladies and gentlemen, l just got word from one of our spotters that Wheels Simpson is in town and headed toward the finish line.
Mork is nowhere in sight.
Well, it looks like Wheels is an easy winner, ladies and gentlemen.
Wheels is coming down this-- Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen.
Our spotter says that Mork is in town and skating towards the mall.
Why are you slowing down?
Use your time warp.
l'm all warped out, Mind.
l don't get it.
The bad guys are winning, and the good guys are here sucking air.
You can do it.
What about all that talk about determination and drive?
Oh, you're right, l can't let a little thing like physical exhaustion stop me.
- Right, go.
- All that drive.
- You wanna see drive?
- Yeah.
- Next stop, the winner's circle.
- Good.
Here l go, Mind.
Here l go.
Mork.
l know, l know.
Oh, they're neck and neck, ladies and gentlemen.
What a race.
Wait a minute, what's that guy pulling?
Let him by, you yutzo.
Holy smoke, did you see that?
Mork, Mork.
You can do it, Mork.
Yeah, you're right.
This one's for you, munchkin.
ls your last name Gipper?
Mork, Mork.
- Are you all right?
- Step back.
Okay, he's all right, ladies and gentlemen.
- Mork.
- Mind, Mind, Mind.
l can't believe it.
You won, you won.
The kids are so excited.
Oh, shucks and wazoo, Mind.
Way to go, Mork.
What you did took a lot of courage and stupidity.
Oh, thank you.
We're all very proud of you, Mork.
Swell, this is really exciting, Mind.
- l think l beat the best, didn't l?
- Yeah, you did.
l guess that makes me top skate now, doesn't it?
You know, people will be skating all over the country going: Oh, maybe l should open up my own roller disco rink, maybe.
So l can teach John Q. Public how to really skate right.
l've learned some basic moves, Mind.
Besides - Watch yourself down there.
- Wait, Mork.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Your Equatorship.
l'm here, Mork.
What's your report this week?
Well, sir, this week l raced a human on roller skates and won.
- What did you win?
- Oh, the race, sir.
But the real winners were the children who got to keep their daycare centre.
Do Earthlings always race on skates?
Oh, no, sir, there are different kinds of races.
There's dog races, horse races, auto races.
lt sounds like racing is very popular there, Mork.
Well, sir, it is.
And the most wonderful race of all could be the human race.
lf they'd only realise that they're all on the same team.
All they need is some kind of international referee.
You know, some You know, sir, l think l look awfully good in black and white stripes, don't you?
Follow me on this one.
Brezhnev, 1 5 miles, illegal invasion.
Castro, you're out of the game, smoking in the huddle.
Amin, you'd be out of the game too if we could find you.
Whoa, there you are, you little sucker.
Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Oh, you two would just love my new place.
Of course, it isn't decorated yet.
Not like yours, Mindy, with all its special little touches.
- You know, it's really a home.
- Oh, thanks.
lt's always comfortable around here.
Oh, it's nice.
Mindy, will you help me make my place a home?
Well, sure.
But, l mean, l'm not a professional or anything.
Oh, that's okay.
We'll keep it real sweet and simple.
Besides, l can only spend 1 0,000.
Dollars?
Ten thousand dollars?
The kind that you get at a bank?
And not a penny more.
l promised myself.
Come on, why don't we start by making a list?
Mindy, would you please get the pen and pencil out of my purse?
Sure.
- Gotcha.
- Glenda.
Glenda, you are just so funny.
l'm gonna start laughing when my heart gets started.
You know, one of the guys in my building gave this to me.
He's a regular riot.
Oh, yeah, he's a regular riot all right.
Hey, can l borrow that?
l'd kind of like to show it to Mork.
Oh, sure, he'll probably love it.
Then l'm taking the other one for Remo.
l am starving.
Let's go to the restaurant and l'll talk him into making us breakfast.
- Okay.
- Listen, you guys go.
Mork's making me a special breakfast this morning.
l just hope that this time, it doesn't jump off the plate.
Jeanie, after breakfast, how about if we go back to my building and we can catch the tail end of the limbo lesson?
Gosh, am l hungry.
lf you are, Mind, then get ready for Tarzan of the Crepes.
Today, today, we're gonna bake something very special.
We're gonna make huevos cosmos.
Here we go.
First of all, let's start off by putting a few pinto beans as a base.
Pinto, from the Spanish word meaning small car.
Now, make sure to add a little sherry.
Oh, what a lovely shade of bleu.
Now, we add our main ingredients, and what you do is first of all, bring out your chicken.
Oh, look, this chicken is so young it's never known love.
Oh, please, please, please.
Oh, it's a boy.
Here we go.
Now, we must dress our chicken.
First, you put your chicken in a lovely two-piece outfit.
And dunk it now just like Esther Williams.
And there goes you.
And once again, a little more sherry, sherry and sherry alike.
And a little for the cook.
You never know when you'll be followed home by a wino.
Now, wait for some more finish or garnish.
For one cannot cook without a little flower.
Once again, a little more sherry and some grated cheese.
Oh, you grate on me, grate, grate, grate.
Put cheese in there, once again, who knows?
Now, once again, a little more sherry.
Oh, what a lovely day.
Oh, boy, one eggplant will do it.
Over here, once again, a little more sherry.
Little more sherry, sherry, sherry.
A little salt.
A little pepper.
And remember, you can put anything in there in the amount of time.
Use your trash compactor, if necessary.
Finishing up, once again, you stir it up and one little more petit cheri.
Oh, bon appetit, my dear, bon appetit.
Fabulous.
Yes, Mind, come on, give it a try.
Throw caution to the wind, Mind.
l think that l'm on a diet.
But l got you a little surprise.
lt's in my purse.
- For me?
- Yeah.
Oh, Mind, l love surprises more than l love freeze-dried pets.
Really, can l have it?
For me?
Yes.
There's nothing in there, Mind.
Mork, it's a snake.
lt's supposed to jump out and scare you.
Oh, l get it.
Oh, no, Mork.
lt's a practical joke.
lt's a prank.
People play them on one another.
lt's supposed to be funny.
l understand that, Mind.
l'm a superior being.
You know, it's a very simple concept: snake, spring, fear.
Let's add that to the dish.
Never mind.
lt was a dumb joke, anyway.
Well, l wasn't gonna say that, Mind.
Well, while you're doing whatever it is you're doing there, l'm gonna run to the store quick and get some decorator magazines.
- Have you seen my car keys?
- Sure, many times.
You know where they might be?
Well, l'll take a wild guess.
Number one, in the purse.
But don't worry, Mind, don't worry, don't worry.
Allow moi, pardon moi.
Oh, no.
A purse.
Oh, my heart, Mind.
You take the house.
Well, this is my place.
Wow, neat.
Where's the refrigerator?
Oh, not now, Stephanie.
l see it.
The rest of you children that don't wanna eat, let's all sit down here for a moment and share a problem with Uncle Mork here.
Well, the basic problem is that l have a heavy case of confusion.
Let us be your beacon through the fog.
Thanks, Lola.
Hey, what's wrong with this refrigerator?
l can't see anything in here.
Oh, l took the bulb out, Stephanie.
l knew you were coming.
Go suck a lemon.
You know, there's free food down at Jack in the Box if you stand next to the clown.
Well, basically, my problem is that Well, l wanna play a practical joke on Mindy and l don't really know any.
l know one.
l went to Jake's Joke Shop and bought a bar of trick soap.
When my brother washed with it, his hands grew black.
Oh, that sure beats busing, doesn't it?
Well, it's just l'm in a desperate situation.
ls there anything else you know?
Mork, there's tons of them.
ltching powder, sneezing powder, pepper gum - Fly in your ice cube.
- Wait a minute.
Oh, great expectations.
l'm gonna scare the dickens out of Mindy.
Great Expectations?
Dickens?
You know, big fella, you're a lot deeper than you look.
Bless you, Lola.
Have you cleaned the refrigerator out yet, Stephanie?
Don't spoil it, Dr. Atkins.
Now, come on.
Boy, does that diet work.
Hi.
How was your day?
Not bad.
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- l don't know.
l guess l'm just kind of a mildly mischievous kind of guy.
Why don't you put your coat in the armoire there?
You never know what might be in there.
Maybe a skeleton or a hokey-pokey man.
- What?
- Oh, maybe you have a bone to pick.
- Go in the closet?
- No, no, no.
No, no, no.
Now, that's funny.
Seeing that, don't you really wanna fatten up?
Let's go to the fridge.
Come on.
Mind, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, Mind, Mind, l hope this doesn't alarm you, but there might be some bell peppers in there.
Titter, titter, chortle, chortle.
- An alarm, huh?
A bell pepper.
- Yes.
Mork, l'll tell you, you're a clever guy.
Listen, Mork, we need to have a little talk.
Look, for a practical joke to work, you're not supposed to know what's gonna happen.
The surprise is what makes it funny.
You're kidding.
Frank, what other symphony conductor dresses like this?
Since you're going fishing, come on in.
Maybe you need some worms for your fishing trip.
- Worms?
- Yeah, they might be in there.
l had a few.
l don't know.
- Worms in there?
- Yeah.
- Give it a shot.
- Here, hold onto this, huh?
lndustrial-strength worms.
This way, you can catch the big suckers.
Mork, that was a pretty good prank.
- lt was a prank, wasn't it?
- l hope.
Pretty good, my boy, pretty good.
But it pales by comparison with some of the exploits of Pranky Franky here.
Pranky Franky?
l'm being dressed by Pranky Franky?
You've heard of the old car-in-the-living-room stunt?
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, that's-- Oh, yeah.
Oh, who hasn't heard of it?
l haven't.
Mork, it's when you take a car apart and put it back together in somebody's living room.
When l was in college, we did that to Professor Franklin's '51 Studebaker.
- Oh, heavy.
- Yes, but well worth the hernia.
That prank made me what l am today.
A legend.
A legend?
Tornado in the windmills of my mind.
Hang on, Toto, hang on.
Well, maybe l don't look so bad in this outfit.
l don't know.
Nobody's gonna see but the fish, and who are they gonna tell except a few water-logged gangsters?
That's the spirit, Fred.
Those fish don't have a chance.
He really does look pretty funny in that outfit, doesn't he?
A chance to become a living legend.
l'll be up there on Mount Rushmore.
Up there, l'll be with Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, Roosevelt and all those other wide receivers.
This is gonna make Mindy love us forever.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, l can't wait till she sees this.
Mind.
Mind, wake up, it's morning.
Can't you hear the little birdies singing outside?
Mork, it is 5:00 in the morning.
How--?
Mork, how did you--?
Why would you?
- When did you get this thing up here?
- Mind, take your time, now.
l know these compliments don't fall tripping off the tongue.
Mork.
Get this Jeep out of here now.
Oh, yes, and?
And get this Jeep out of here now.
Morning, Mr. Bickley.
Are you sure you're all right, Mr. Bickley?
Just a second before, l was sitting in that chair.
l got up to fill my Thermos with coffee.
l owe my life to Joe DiMaggio.
Oh, don't worry about that hole, Mr. Bickley.
l'll Spackle it over.
Don't worry.
l think my insurance should cover this.
l'll just have to check on a technicality, if my apartment is covered for collision.
Well, apart from the obvious physical and emotional trauma, is there any latent appreciation for what l've achieved here?
l see.
Well, excuse me.
Excu-- l'm going fishing.
l've gotta get out of here.
l don't know what l'm gonna tell my maid.
She won't even do windows.
Oh, Mind, look at the bright side.
lt's always good to have friends you can drop in on.
Mork, listen to me.
Don't hit me.
Don't hit me.
What you did was not funny.
We can't even go into our apartment because of that.
And l don't even wanna think what might've happened to Mr. Bickley, much less how much this is gonna cost to fix.
lt was a stupid and dangerous prank.
You should have been more careful.
Well, l was careful, Mind.
l set the handbrake.
- You set the handbrake?
- Yeah.
You set the handbrake?
My Jeep falls through my floor and you say you set the handbrake?
l can't take any more of this, Mork.
l'm getting out of here.
- Good.
Where are we going?
- We're not going anywhere.
You're staying and cleaning up this mess and getting that Jeep out.
l'm going to Glenda Faye's.
Mind, Mind.
Well, Mindy Well, this is the last box.
Oh, Glenda, l just keep thinking about it.
l mean, a Jeep falling through my floor.
How many years can a normal person put up with that kind of stuff?
Four?
l mean, when l first met Mork, l knew he was different, but-- You know, l noticed that too, but l never said anything.
You see, l was brought up to laugh behind people's backs.
All l know is if this kind of stuff keeps up, Mork's just gonna have to find another Earth-- Roommate.
Oh, my.
This is serious, isn't it?
Well, listen, Mindy, you're welcome to stay here until you work things out.
Besides, we'll have a ball.
This is a singles apartment.
Hi, Derrick.
Far out.
Farther out.
Hey, guys.
Glad you came by.
l'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
Mindy, these are my neighbours.
- Derrick.
- Hi, Derrick.
And this is-- Todd Norman Taylor, but you can call me TNT.
Kind of a dynamite guy, you know.
- Hi.
- Great personality.
Say, look, l'm kind of new in town.
How do l get to your place?
Glenda, is there something l could help you with in the kitchen?
No, no, no.
Now, you just sit.
l'll get us all something to drink.
- Just yell if you need anything else.
- Okay.
Well, l think l have everything l need right here.
Cheese puffs?
No, l just ate.
l have heavier chains for when it snows.
l bought them out of my slush fund.
But serious time now, have you ever really listened to Manilow?
No.
Happy hour.
Strawberry margaritas.
Cowabunga.
Say, why don't we share a margarita, huh?
You go right, l'll go left, we'll have a salt-lick race around the rim.
l don't believe this.
She loves me.
ls this fun or what?
You're a crazy lady, you know that?
lsn't she a crazy lady?
Yeah, she's crazy.
Say, look, how would you like to take a nice, warm dip in my Jacuzz?
Fabulous.
Sure, we can fill it up with club soda and bob for lemon slices.
We'll go change.
Meet you downstairs in 20 minutes.
Better make that 25.
l have to Scotchgard my chains.
Brenda, Cindy, see you later, ladygators.
Wasn't that fun?
Weren't they terrific?
Are you serious?
Glenda, they didn't even know our names.
But they were close.
Well, besides, what's in a name, as long as you're happy?
Oh, come on, you don't really believe that.
Sure.
Oh, look, you're gonna love it here.
We'll be so busy, we won't even have time to think about what's bothering us.
l mean, you.
What's bothering you.
Glenda, come on, what's really going on?
l really don't wanna talk about it.
Are you sure?
Oh, Mindy, l'm not sure about anything since my husband died.
Well, that's why l moved in here.
l just wanna laugh, say hi, no involvements and nothing personal.
Well, l can understand that.
Thanks, Mindy.
lt's just that every once in a while, l miss having somebody who really cares about me.
You are so lucky to have Mork.
l am?
Give him another chance.
A hole in your floor is a lot better than a hole in your ceiling.
A hole in your ceiling is a lot better than a Well, either way, it's a lot better than a hole in your life.
Yeah.
You know, l really never realised how good l had it till l saw what was really out there.
Things aren't so bad at home.
You know, Bebo, a lot of people would consider this a very depressing situation.
You don't have to be one of them.
l wish that hole in the ceiling was the only thing l had to patch up.
l really miss Mind.
Mork.
Sometimes l can almost hear her voice now.
Mork, can l talk to you for a minute?
Mind.
Mind, you're here.
Bebo, wait.
No, no, Bebo, no.
l'm sorry, Mind.
l'm sorry to add polyester to injury.
Mork, l think there are a few things we should straighten out.
Well, before you say another word, l've already started my self-improvement plan and l've made a list of my bad points.
Well, there would've been more, except the tears made the ink run.
First of all, l belch with my finger.
Second, l snore with my toes, l chew my toenails, l sit on my face.
Oh, Mork, nobody's perfect.
Yes, Mind, you are.
l mean, you're wholesome.
ln the dictionary, it says, ''Perfect, see Mindy.
'' No, l'm not.
For one thing, l don't have any patience.
l should have known you didn't mean any harm.
l mean, you were only trying to make me laugh.
Yeah, l thought it was just a joke.
But, Mind, sometimes l'm a really trying guy.
Well, that's very true.
But you also have an awful lot of good points.
Oh, l know that too, Mind.
l made a list of those.
Here it is.
''Mindy McConnell is my friend.
'' That's all that's on here.
That's all l could think of, Mind, when l was sitting here alone.
Oh, Mork, you know, you're crazy, weird, aggravating Oh, l can't help it, Mind.
l'm a Libra.
lmpulsive, exasperating and frustrating.
But, you know, you're also very caring, and that's what makes it all worth it.
You still like me?
Well: Back on Ork, we have a very special custom when making up.
Well, what's that?
First of all, we grab each other's hands, we look very deeply into each other's eyes.
- Yeah?
- That's it.
That's it?
Really?
Well, on Earth, we usually do all that, and then we kiss.
You sure you want to?
Well, l don't know.
Okay.
Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson, come in, Your Oliver Hardyness.
l hope l didn't call you too early.
- Oh, by the way, Mork, - Sir.
l wanted to thank you for the box of cigars you sent me.
Oh, no sweat, Chief Smoke.
l mean, l hope you got a bang out of them.
You see, sir, that's what's called a practical joke here on Earth.
Nonsense.
No jokes are practical.
Oh, sir, come on, now.
They serve a purpose.
l mean, jokes can fill your life with surprises.
Life isn't supposed to be surprising.
lt's supposed to be ordered and predictable, Mork.
Oh, but where's the fun in that, Your Old Fogeyness?
lf life were predictable, no one would watch Miss America, they'd know who's hosting The Tonight Show, and no one would believe that an actor could become president.
lmagine, giving a State of the Union address: ''My fellow Line.
'' - That's unpredictable?
- No, sir, that's incredible.
And so is that warm feeling you get when you tell a friend a joke.
But the most important thing, sir, is to have a friend that you wanna tell a joke to.
And if not, the joke's on you.
Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
lt's perfect for television.
l simply love it, Mindy, and so will Channel 1 9.
That look just screams anchorperson.
l don't know, Glenda Faye.
Don't you think it's kind of a little too daring?
lt's kind of flashy.
Now, you know as well as l do that every TV news team has one blond.
Barbara Walters, Rona Barrett, Frank Reynolds.
Yeah, but l couldn't go to an interview looking like this.
My hair feels naked.
Well, maybe that's why blonds have more fun.
Well, l've been brunet all my life and l've had fun.
Have you ever water-skied the Amazon?
No.
Have you ever danced with a Sherpa guide on the slopes of the Himalayas?
Gone ice sailing with an Eskimo prince?
l can't say that l have.
Of course not.
Brunets aren't invited to those things.
And they aren't invited to be anchorpersons, either.
Thanks for the ride, Mrs. Rebozo.
Say ''hi'' to Bebe too.
Oh, no, Mind.
Attack of the Bleach People.
What?
They turned you into Sandra Dee.
They sucked on your scalp.
Oh, no.
Oh, they have.
They turned you into Swedish.
Mork, it's just a wig.
l knew that, Mind.
May l see it for just a minute?
Sure.
Cold immobilizes them, Mind.
Glenda Faye was trying to talk me into bleaching my hair for a job interview l have at Channel 1 9.
Trust me, it'll work.
Well, l must be off to my tai chi class.
That would be very effective against a mugger on tranquillizers.
Well, sayonara.
l learned that on Shogun.
- So how was your day at the zoo?
- Oh, it was wonderful.
- More than that, it was two-derful.
- Oh, yeah?
l observed all these wonderful, weird animals.
l saw two ants.
l saw a black widow going, ''Baby, you ain't coming back here.
'' l saw a praying mantis.
They don't really pray, they just kind of chant.
And then there was-- Oh, and l saw a butterfly and a bird and a dog.
Those are the only animals you saw?
Well, Mind, only the weird ones stick in my mind.
Oh, and l also made a friend at the zoo.
His name is Doc.
Oh, great.
Does he live around here?
No, he lives at the zoo.
He's a chimpanzee.
He lives there with his mother.
lt was wonderful.
We had this incredible conversation about how Darwin was wrong.
Right, Mork.
Well, l'm glad you had a good time at the zoo.
Oh, good, Mind.
l can't wait to go back.
Do you have any 50-pound bags of peanuts around?
No, l think we're all out.
Pity.
Since Carter lost, l thought we would.
Well, Mork You're gonna be all right here, Doc, till we find who kidnapped your mom.
Okay, that's all right.
You're not even safe in a zoo anymore.
That's incredible.
l mean, they should put bars upon bars.
There you go.
Boy, you are tired, aren't you?
Well, we'll find a place for you.
Have a little monk nap.
Let's see, we can't put you over there.
Yeah, you can't hang around-- What am l talking about?
Mind would be mad if l didn't give you the best room.
Come on, you can sleep in Mind's bed.
Don't be afraid.
She's got a life-sized doll of Jackson Browne.
Don't worry.
- Hi, Mork.
- Oh, hi, Mind.
Well, l took Glenda Faye's advice and got the hair dye.
l guess the moment of truth has come.
Do l become a blond or do l chicken out?
Mork, l want you to tell me the truth.
lf l do this to my hair, do you think l'll lose my--?
- You know, my girl-next-door quality?
- l don't know.
Ask the guy next door.
The one with the binoculars, who drools a lot.
Oh, what's the big deal anyway?
So l become a blond.
lt'll all be worth it if l get that job interview.
l hope.
While l was at the zoo, something special happened.
Can you tell me later?
lf l don't do this now, l'm gonna chicken out.
- Oh, it'll keep.
- l'll talk to you later.
Okay, one minute.
Maybe less.
- There's a monkey in my bed.
- lt's not actually a monkey.
lt's a chimp.
That's a common misconception.
You see, there are two groups.
The simian groups and-- Would l seem forward if l asked for an explanation?
No, just inquisitive.
You see, that's my friend, Doc.
The one l told you about, at the zoo?
l sprung him.
Mork, you took a chimp from the zoo last year.
That was different.
He was an exchange student.
Mork, you've gotta get him back.
Mind, you don't understand.
You really don't understand.
You're being so harsh and cruel.
Mind, his mother was kidnapped from the zoo and l'm afraid the same men will come back and kidnap him.
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
You kidnapped the chimp.
You were afraid that chimp was gonna be kidnapped by the people that kidnapped the chimp's mother?
And they say Earthlings are slow.
How do you get involved in these things?
Oh, Mind, l'm just trying to be a caring, loving person, like you taught me.
Mork, it's still not right to steal a chimp.
Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
Now, may l pose a hypothetical question to you?
You're out strolling and lo and behold, you come upon Bambi in the middle of a burning forest.
Now, here's the question.
What do you do?
You either lead Bambi to safety across the river, or do you baste him in barbecue sauce and have Bambi in a bucket?
Time's up, Mind.
Oh, all right.
The zoo's probably closed anyway.
- You gotta take him back tomorrow.
- Oh, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
l bet in the dictionary it says, ''merciful, see Mindy.
'' Oh, Mind.
Mind, you won't even know he's here except for a few more hairs in the sink.
But, hey, don't worry about that.
Oh, Mind, l'll take him back tomorrow.
l promise, l really do promise and-- Hey, just think how lucky you are.
You get to sleep with him.
What?
Oh, Mind, come on, he's scared and lonely.
lt's his first night away.
- He's terrified.
- Right, Mork.
l'll tell you what.
You sleep with the monkey and l'll sleep right here on the couch.
But l gotta dye my hair because l got that interview at 9:00 in the morning - He's got on my best nightgown.
- l know, Mind.
He had a hard time deciding.
He tried on everything in your drawer.
Mind?
Mind?
Mind?
- Mind?
- Are we there yet?
Mind, Mind, l'm really sorry l startled you like this, but, l mean, Doc's hungry.
He'd like some warm milk.
- Oh, okay.
- Good.
l'll go unplug the refrigerator.
Why don't you get him some water?
Oh, Mind, even asleep, you're hotter than a pistol.
Thanks.
Water, water.
Doc had the hiccups, so l had to scare him.
- You did that well.
- Thanks.
Well, l might as well get up.
lt's only four hours until my job interview.
At least l'll be able to paint the circles out from under my eyes.
l'm very sorry about all this, but you take such good care of me, l thought you could help take care of him.
Yeah, l know, Mork.
You always mean well.
l'd do the same for anybody whose mother was kidnapped from the zoo.
Well, l'm gonna go to bed now, and try and keep it quiet out here, will you?
Well, since l'm up, l might as well see how my hair turned out.
No!
No.
- Oh, no.
- Cured his hiccups, Mind.
Thanks.
Mork, look at my hair.
lt's terrible.
lt's supposed to be blond, but it's green.
Well, you're right, Mind.
lnstead of being short and sassy, - it's kind of short and grassy.
- Oh, no.
What a night.
l didn't get any sleep, my hair is green, there's a monkey in my bed.
Oh, l wish that darn chimp had never come here.
- Oh, you don't mean that, Mind.
- Oh, l don't know what l mean.
lt seems like ever since that monkey got here, everything's been going wrong.
Oh, green hair?
Oh, Mind, Mind, come on, now.
l think you look terrific.
l mean, you can always be like an lrish debutante.
Or you can be like a punk prom queen.
- Oh, Mork, cut it out.
- Or you can be Miss Algae.
Mind, come on, now.
Wait.
You could be like a good-time girl for a leprechaun.
Well, l guess l wasn't meant to be a blond.
l'll just have to buy some dye in the morning and change it back to my natural colour.
What, gopher brown?
No, it's closer to woodchuck, l think.
Anyway, l'm gonna go and see if l can rinse any more of this stuff out.
- Mork, he's gone.
- No, Mind, don't-- - Doc?
Doc?
- Doc?
Doc, Doc, Doc.
Get in there, shorty, and no funny business.
- Oh, Exidor, you found him.
- Mork, thank goodness you're all right.
You too, Mork.
l just caught this burglar running from your house wearing your clothes.
l had visions of you tied to a chair, wearing nothing but rope.
Not a pretty picture.
- He's not a burglar, though.
- Oh, really?
Then how do you explain this?
My hunch is they're your family peanuts and he swiped them.
Lucky for you, l'm your neighbourhood vigilante.
Boulder can sleep peacefully knowing Brutus and l are on patrol.
- Brutus?
- My Doberman.
- Hello there.
- l wouldn't touch him there.
Well, l'm sure you two have a lot to talk about.
l'm gonna take Doc into the bedroom.
By the way, do you know your hair is green?
Yes, l do.
Did you lose a bet?
- No.
- l see.
ln that case: Mork, you're a fool.
Don't you see what's going on right under your nose?
What?
Am l growing a moustache?
You'll have to grow a lot more than that if you're gonna compete with him.
Did you see the way she looked at him?
Mork, they're in this together.
They're gonna rob you blind and run off to Rio.
Exidor, you don't understand, really.
Has she ever carried you like that?
Think about it.
Brutus, heel.
Heel, Brutus.
Heel.
Good dog.
Good dog.
Give me your paw.
Give me a paw.
No, no, the front one.
Exidor, l don't think you really understand.
You see, he's not an ex-con.
He's not gonna run off with Mindy.
- He's a friend of mine.
- Clever disguise.
You can't even see the zipper.
Wait a minute.
You see, his mother was kidnapped and l'm hiding him here till we find out where she is.
Have you checked the pawn shops?
Brutus, don't.
Heel, heel.
Good dog, good dog.
No, no, you see, he came from the zoo.
And l can't go there because they might recognise me, but, wait a minute, you can go because you'd be inconspicuous.
That's true.
Just another face in the crowd.
Know when to hold them And know when to fold them All right, Doc, how many you want?
None?
Pretty cocky.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
l'll take four.
ls that some sort of signal?
One, two, four.
Well, that fills my inside straight.
Well, l call.
What do you have?
Well.
Four aces, king high.
That does kind of beat a 6.
Just because you cleaned me out, l'm not gonna show you my centrefold of Jane Goodall now.
Oh, somebody's at the door, Doc.
Come on, go sit down over here.
Here we go.
You wait there for me.
l'm not mad about losing, especially since it makes you forget your mom.
l'll be right back.
Don't worry.
- Hey, Pops.
- Hi, Mork.
l brought over some of Mindy's old toys like you asked.
So that's Doc.
Yeah, that's the child that Fay Wray never talks about.
You know, l've never been up real close to a chimpanzee before.
Oh, don't worry.
They won't hurt you.
- Shake hands with him.
- Shake hands?
No, no, l don't think so.
l have a rule.
Never give a wild animal something you might want back.
Oh, no, come on, come on, now.
Here, watch this.
Hey, shake hand.
Yeah.
You know, l think Mindy's right.
- He should go back to the zoo.
- Come on, now.
You primates sit down and get to know each other.
- No.
- Come on, now.
There you go.
Relax.
l'll be right back.
l'm going to get a couple of bananas.
Don't worry.
You're not gonna leave me with this thing?
Why?
You won't hurt him.
l'm going to talk to you in a kind voice and move very slowly.
Look, l'm smiling.
lf you can understand, l like you a lot.
l brake for animals.
Hey, here's something you might like.
Look.
See this?
This is a tricycle.
Can you ride one?
Well, maybe you can't, so l'll show you.
Car break down again, Pops?
No, l'm just making a fool out of myself for my very good friend.
Well, bye, Mork, and have Mindy call me.
Bye, pal, and thanks for sparing me.
Hi there.
Hello, Exidor.
And goodbye.
Nice guy.
My dad used to walk backwards.
- Know what stopped him?
- No, what?
'68 Pontiac.
Well, what's the news?
What did you find out about--?
Excuse me.
lxnay, ixnay.
lmpchay amray understanderay.
Doc, come on, time for a little nap nap.
There we go.
Wanna come up?
Here we go, here we go.
Don't you worry.
l'll tell you that story again.
All right, what's the news about his mother?
- Sit down, l can take it, l can take it.
- My first thought was white slavery.
Then l figured, no, why sign up for that if l have to go look for a chimp?
Then l ran into a keeper and he told me they'd rushed his mother to the zoo hospital.
She wasn't kidnapped.
She was in the hospital.
- What was she in there for?
- Well, l couldn't find out, except that it's serious.
Oh, no.
Oh, if it's serious, you gotta get there right away.
- We've gotta take him too.
- Hold it, Mork.
There's a posse out looking for your fuzzy friend.
lt seems some fool kidnapped him.
Coast is clear.
You know, Mork, it's not easy sneaking a hot chimp back into a zoo.
This is only the third time l've done it.
The disguise worked because every time l call him Don Vito, no one bothered to question him.
You know, hospitals give me the heebie-jeebies.
That's why l quit the doctor biz.
Let's see if anybody's home.
l'm sorry, l can't talk right now.
We're in the middle of some complicated surgery.
Who was that masked man?
An animal doctor who shaved off his fur.
Exidor, l better talk to Doc alone.
Doc, now, you and l have to have a man-to-simian talk for just a second.
Yeah.
You see, l don't know what's wrong with your mother in there, but if she doesn't get better, she's gonna go to a very special place.
lt's called animal heaven.
Everything's wonderful up there, where bananas grow on clouds, and you can swing from anything you want.
And Flicka's up there and Trigger and all three Lassies.
You don't have to worry about anything, though.
Yeah, l know you're worried, but, you see, you'll always have part of her to hold on to, and that's her love for you.
You were waiting for--?
Doc.
The whole zoo's been looking for him.
Where's he been?
Well, he was in Boulder overnight.
We brought him right back.
Well, his mom's had a tough time, but she's all right now.
- Come on, Doc.
- Hey, goodbye, little fella.
Thanks very much and take care.
Oh, l got a surprise for you.
l'm gonna take you back to your mama.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
Oh, l'm gonna miss that little guy.
l'd like you to meet Doc's new baby brother.
Baby brother?
So that's why his mom was in the hospital.
Oh, look at that.
Look at that, he's got his brother's knuckles.
And he's got Charles Bronson's chin.
Thanks for getting Doc back to us.
Now the whole family can be together.
No sweat.
Hey, take care, little: lt's a boy.
lt's a boy.
Have a cigar.
Don't mind if l do.
lt's a baby boy.
Yeah, wait a sec.
Hold on, l didn't mean to wake you up.
l'm sorry.
Don't-- No, Glenda Faye, somebody else got it.
Thanks for your help, but next time l go on a job interview, it's gonna be with my own hair.
Yeah.
Okay, l'll talk to you real soon.
Okay, bye.
- Oh, shazbot, l lost.
- What are you doing?
Playing strip solitaire, and l'm losing fast.
Oh, so anyway, finish your story.
You didn't get in trouble or anything when you brought Doc back?
No, l just told them l found him.
The problem is l didn't tell them where.
l guess everything turned out for the best.
l got my hair back - and Doc's back with his family.
- Yeah.
lt's a good thing too, but you know something, Mind?
l really miss that little guy.
You know: You know, Mind, l've been thinking, maybe we could-- Don't do this to me, Mork.
Mind, you're right.
l'll never spring another animal from the zoo, l promise.
l mean, this Orkan has learned his lesson.
He must have answered the ad, Mind.
Let me show you upstairs.
This is where you're going for your room.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, oh, Victor Huge-O.
That's not my name.
Well, l'll cut the fat and get to the meat.
This week, sir, my report is on the status of animals on Earth.
l assume they're the respected elite?
Oh, no, sir, that's only on Ork, according to the decree by Prime Minister Fluffy.
But some animals have it very good.
They're called pets, just like Beebs here.
Right, Beebs?
Yeah, yeah, you know how that is.
They have it great.
Room and board, their dish with a name on it, and all the newspapers they can read.
Do all animals on Earth live this way?
Well, no, sir.
Some live in places called zoos, where they're protected.
Do any animals roam free in their natural environment?
Yes, sir, but they're called game.
Sir, l wonder how much fun the game would be, though, if the animals were the ones with the rifles.
- Tell me, Mork.
- Sir.
Do you think animals will ever reach the status they have on Ork?
Well, sir, l have faith.
But it'll take some time.
l know that there are some humans who love and understand animals, and realise that all living things have feelings, even though they don't have the words to express them.
And on that happy note, sir, l say good night.
ln the words of my friend, Doc the chimp: Which means, na-no, na-no, sir.
Until next week.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Good morning, everybody.
I teII you, I've been working on your Jeep for over an hour and I can't find out what's wrong with it.
My battery's dead.
When I woke up this morning, my battery was dead.
I can't understand what happened.
WeII, couId Ieaving the car Iights on aII night have any effect on that?
Why, yes, it couId.
Why wouId you ask?
- No reason, no reason at aII.
- Mork.
Oh, aII right, Mindy.
There's a big reason, but a very good one, though.
There's aIways good reason.
- Oh, you understand, Pops, don't you?
- Yes, I do.
WeII, basicaIIy, there's this cute IittIe oId wino outside and he was sIeeping in the gutter, and I Ieft the Iights on so no one wouId park on him.
You're so courteous.
Mork, as soon as I finish my coffee, I'II drop you off at the day care centre.
Oh, thanks, Pops.
You know Oh, Mind, Mind, opening-night jitters, I've got the fIop sweat aIready.
I don't even have a costume yet.
Mork had this idea about the kids dressing up as their favourite hero.
Yeah, kids today couId use some heroes.
Yeah.
When I was a boy, I used to Iike the Western heroes.
Roy Rogers and Gene Autry and Tex Ritter.
In those days, you couId aIways teII who the good guys were because they aII wore big white hats and pIayed guitars.
I aIways used to wonder why they never rode into town pIaying a vioIin.
That's probabIy because aII the Indians had the bows.
Imagine Custer's Iast concerto: I guess my favourite hero was the Lone Ranger.
Oh, the Lone Ranger's a reaI good one, Mork.
I think you'd Iike him because he aIways settIed fights peacefuIIy.
Oh, Mind.
Whoa, paraIIeI universe.
We have someone Iike that just on Ork.
On Ork, you have somebody Iike the Lone Ranger?
Yes.
WeII, he's more Iike the Lone Chicken.
See, whenever there'd be troubIe, he wouId aIways hide.
His favourite motto was, ''When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping.
'' - Sounds Iike the Gabor sisters to me.
- Yeah.
That's it.
I can go as SqueIIman the YeIIow.
What a strange pIanet.
Making a hero out of someone who does nothing but hide.
- What does he Iook Iike?
- No one ever saw his face.
AII we ever saw was this yeIIow-feathered tush hightaiIing it into the sunset.
Happy tails to you Until we meet again And wiII Ieap taII buiIdings with a singIe boo.
It's a turkey.
No, it's SqueIIman the YeIIow.
The proud coward with the goIden taiI.
Now, you see, that's a hero where I came from.
By creative hiding, that's how he survived.
WeII, know who's up next?
Who's up?
You're up, Jonathan.
I'II give you a hint.
Sugar Ray Leonard.
One more hint and I might get it.
Speaking of sugar, when do we eat?
Now, Stephanie, you just had Iunch, and very few peopIe can eat a whoIe turkey and Iive.
Now, who's your hero, Stephanie?
Sara Lee.
I might have guessed.
- Stick a brownie in your ear.
- Stephanie, if you keep this up, one day you're gonna go on an eIevator and it's gonna say, ''Capacity: You.
'' Who's your hero, LoIa?
Truman Capote.
For his accurate, yet IyricaI portrayaI of the human condition.
LoIa, one day you're gonna have a taIk show aII of your own.
BiIIy, who's your hero?
My dad picked my hero for me.
- WeII, who is it?
- Him.
He wants me to be a doctor Iike he is.
Oh, that's not a bad hero.
I mean, they save Iives, they pIay great goIf and they never bother you at home.
Big deaI.
My dad won't Iet me be who I reaIIy wanna be.
- WeII, who's that?
- A guy with my name.
BiIIy the Kid.
He was a tough hombre.
His dad never toId him what to do.
Oh, BiIIy the Kid.
Isn't that the president's brother?
The one that heIped Reagan get eIected?
No?
Sorry.
No, Mork, he was a famous cowboy.
PeopIe say he used to Iive in that oId ghost town near here.
That's it, a ghost town, the uItimate retirement viIIage.
Imagine the maid changing the sheets up thereyou know?
Jonathan meant Windy GuIch, the oId town outside of BouIder.
I bet BiIIy had fun out there.
Got to camp out, never ate broccoIi.
BiIIy, come as BiIIy the Kid if you want.
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Mork.
- Oh, shucks and wazoo, IittIe Yoda.
WeII, that's it for today.
Time for our fieId trip.
We're gonna go to that chemicaI pIant by the river and watch the dead fish race.
Oh, no.
Thanks for the ride, Exidor.
Lucky for you the Shriners canceIIed.
Mork, I'm going out of town and I'd Iike you to take aII my phone caIIs.
- AII right.
- Here.
Where's the receiver?
I don't know, I just don't want anybody caIIing me Iong-distance.
Listen, I'm sure you two boys have a Iot to chitchat about, so I'II just Ieave you two aIone.
Mind, Mind, come on now, Exidor's our friend.
Exidor is your friend, Mork.
You know, quite a few peopIe think he's a IittIe strange.
I've heard those ugIy rumours and they're grossIy exaggerated.
Do you have any chinchiIIa dip?
I rest my case.
Mork.
I'm going away on a very secret trip, so secret in fact that I've bIindfoIded my burro.
Some caII it kinky, I caII it security.
Hush-toned, why is it so secret?
Mork, there's a fortune buried out there.
I inherited this map from my Iate grandfather.
He's deceased, you know.
There's nothing on this map, Exidor.
A necessary precaution.
Besides, I've got it aII right there, Mork.
Oh, you memorized it, huh?
No, I had it tattooed on the inside of my eyeIid.
Steinmetz, Pepe, Guido, Ioad up the burro and piIe on.
I'm an equaI-opportunity empIoyer.
AII those peopIe on one burro, that's incredibIe.
Those amazing animaIs.
If you shouId get a post card saying, ''Wish you were bIank,'' you know who it's from.
I'II be back in about a month.
Frankie, Annette, surf's up.
Mind, you can come out now, Exidor's gone.
Exidor was gone when he got here.
WeII, I hope your day's been going better than mine.
Oh, me too, Mind.
My idea about the heroes with the kids was a great success except for BiIIy.
Oh, why?
His father wanted him to be a doctor.
Why?
That's a good hero.
WeII, he didn't Iike it, so I found him a new one, BiIIy the Kid.
That's not so good, Mork.
BiIIy the Kid was a murderer.
He kiIIed 21 peopIe.
You don't know that for sure.
I mean, you know how peopIe gossip at funeraIs.
Mind, I mean, he must have done something to become famous.
WeII, sometimes peopIe become famous for the wrong reasons.
Kids aIways imitate their idoIs, so it's better for everybody if you pick somebody good.
Oh, that's right.
Boy, was I wrong, Mind.
Why do Morks rush in where wise men fear to tread?
Boy, that goose must weigh a ton.
Oh, good, it's the tow truck.
I'd better get out there before my auto-cIub card expires.
Oh, hi, BiIIy.
- Hey there, IittIe buckaroo.
- Howdy, Mork.
Yo, hey, just knock your feet together twice.
We'II do a IittIe Chap Stick.
Good to see you there, urban cowkid.
Let's you and me go down to the oId ghost town and have a shootout.
Oh, can't go, BiIIy, I've gotta stay and heIp Mindy bury her dead battery.
See, besides that, BiIIy, I think that-- I didn't reaIise that BiIIy the Kid was into retroactive famiIy pIanning.
Come on, he was a hero.
You're just saying that because you're a fraidy cat Iike SqueIIman the YeIIow.
WeII, thanks for the compIiments, but I stiII can't go.
Come on, it's just a game.
Oh, game or no game, BiIIy, you see, it simuIates vioIence.
Hey, if you reaIIy wanna understand SqueIIman the YeIIow, Iet's pIay his favourite game, cher chez moi, which is hide-and-seek.
Okay, but I'm warning you, BiIIy the Kid's smarter.
I'II be it, you go hide.
Oh, okay.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 1 1 Adios, turkey.
OIIie oIIie oxen free.
Come on, now.
You'II never find me, I studied with CIaude Rains.
WeII, the Jeep's fixed.
You're not even cIose, you're not even tepid.
I'II give you a hint.
Liberace.
What's going on?
Mind, Mind, quiet.
I'm pIaying hide-and-seek with BiIIy, and I'm reaIIy skunking him, he hasn't got a chance.
No, you're not, I just saw him take off down the street on his bike.
He said you'd know where to find him.
Oh, no, Mind, oh, no.
He's gone down to Windy GuIch.
You mean that oId ghost town near here, why?
- I guess he wants to have a shootout.
- Oh, great.
WeII, we better go get him.
Oh, Mind, Mind, it's aII right.
It's my responsibiIity, I'd better go get my trusty 45.
Wait a minute, I thought SqueIIman was a pacifist.
WeII, he is, Mind.
That's his manuaI, 45 Ways to Hide.
Come on, now.
You Iook in the saIoon and I'II check the Iivery stabIe next door.
BiIIy.
BiIIy.
BiIIy, come out now.
This is Father Mork taIking to you, son.
BiIIy, you shouIdn't be here, you shouId be home watching TV with the other IittIe kids, eating cereaI and getting hypogIycaemic now.
Don't move, varmint, I got the drop on you.
BiIIy, now, come on-- I toId you not to move.
I got a baIIoon in here with your name on it.
You don't wanna continue this and scare Ork chips out of Mork, do you?
Yeah.
Just checking.
No, BiIIy, no, pIease.
Mind, pIease be carefuI, he might have a baIIoon with your name on it too.
What?
I don't know what's going on here.
But you're coming home with us, young man, right now.
Sure, push me around just because you're oIder than me.
You're just Iike my dad.
Mind, if we make him go home right now, he'II think that vioIence is the right way.
But he's just a IittIe kid.
We can't Ieave him tiII he grows up.
Yeah, I reaIise that.
This is dueIIing phiIosophies right here.
It's vioIence against nonvioIence.
It's Iike Ghandi vs.
Dick the Bruiser.
You understand?
Like, ''I don't want to hurt the IittIe kitty.
'' ''Give it to me.
I'II eat the thing on hoof.
'' That's what I'm trying to say to you, Mind.
AII right, do it your way.
Time for a showdown.
We each get a baIIoon.
If I hit you, BiIIy's best.
If you hit me, SqueIIman's best.
You're on.
Except SqueIIman doesn't use weapons.
Mork, I don't think-- Okay, sucker.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
No, Mind, Mind.
Mind, I hope now that you appreciate the subtIety of my phiIosophy.
Look at the good side, Mind, you couId aIways win a wet sweater contest.
Gotcha, Mork.
I win.
Not so fast, BiIIy.
Mind over spIatter.
Viva la Squellman.
Oh, yeah?
It's not over yet, Mork.
Mork, I don't think this is gonna work.
- We gotta do something to heIp him.
- Yeah.
Somehow we've gotta prove to him that being an outIaw is onIy exciting in the movies.
That Butch and Sundance weren't heroes, they were onIy handsome.
Wait a minute, Mind.
Bingo.
That's an oId reIigious saying on Ork.
I think I have a way of ending this confrontation, Mind.
I think there's a soIution to the possibIe vioIence that's escaIating before our eyes.
We have to find young BiIIy, the young person who was just in here, who attempted to assassinate me with aqua pura.
And if we find him, we must convince him why BiIIy the Kid never became BiIIy the AduIt.
And when we do that, we'II have a soIution that is Rosemary, did you get aII that?
Good.
Erase it.
Okay, Mork, I'm gonna go down to the gas station to caII his parents.
You wait here to see if BiIIy shows up.
Come on out, you IiIy-Iivered coward.
I heard you're Iooking for me, kid.
Where are you?
I just rode into town a IittIe whiIe ago.
My horse is tied up outside.
I wouIdn't hoId that baIIoon if I were you.
You see these notches on these suspenders here?
There's 21 of them, you know what happens when I get 22?
- What?
- My pants faII down.
That's why I have to wear this serape here.
What's going on?
What happened to SqueIIman?
SqueIIman?
Somewhere, someone's got a fistfuI of feathers.
Why don't you come on down, son?
Buy you a IittIe drink.
Right now, I'm so thirsty I couId beIch dust.
Barkeep, sarsapariIIa for my friend, and I'II sip danger.
Come on, Mork.
Neat.
How'd you do that?
There's some questions you can't answer, BiIIy, Iike how does Venus de Milo hitchhike?
Mind if I tinkIe, BiII?
Wow, this is fun.
Yeah, ain't it?
It wasn't aIways that much fun, BiIIy.
EspeciaIIy when there were guns invoIved.
You know, sometimes there might be a reaI intense game going on here with peopIe sitting in those chairs.
Let your imagination wander.
See what happens.
What I think here is we have a faiIure to deaI an honest hand.
Hey, you're accusing me of cheating?
I'm teIIing you're accusing me of cheating, no.
I'm just saying you got a face so ugIy a coyote shouId beat it out with a stick.
I'm teIIing you.
You're teIIing me that?
Don't you taIk to me Iike that.
Yep.
Yup, that's what I said.
Happy trails to you Oh, stuff it, Roy, and I don't mean Trigger.
Don't you understand?
There's a Iot of stuff going down here.
You'II never go on here.
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.
AII right, the rest of you.
Come on, quit hiding from it.
They're not doing diddIy.
Let's get down to the action.
That did it, you aII done it now.
You've had it now.
Watch out, BiIIy.
WeII, BiIIy, that seem Iike fun to you?
No, it's pretty scary.
Oh, that's just what UncIe Mork wanted to hear.
I guess we can head on home now and taIk about this one Iater.
- Remember this for when we're oIder.
- Nope.
Oh, no.
Mayday.
Amrak.
AII systems aIert.
Damien, Part Four.
- It's aII over, Mork.
- No, no, BiIIy.
No, wait.
I won.
- BiIIy the Kid did it again.
- What--?
What happened?
Mork.
What happened?
Hey, get up, Mork.
The game's over.
Look, vioIence isn't a game, BiIIy.
But it was just pretend.
Mork, are you aII right?
Mork.
Mind, is BiIIy nearby?
I can't see too cIearIy.
Oh, no.
I think he needs a doctor.
Gee, I wish my dad were here, he's a doctor.
There's a coId trough outside.
I'II go get a coId washcIoth.
Okay.
Oh, no.
Mork.
Mind, can you stop doing that?
You're curIing my eyebrows.
Wait a minute.
You mean, you're aII right?
Mind, as I feII through the air, I had this incredibIe idea.
I thought I might just wing it, you know?
I mean, SqueIIman had this incredibIe fIair for the dramatic.
I'm gIad you're aII right, but I think I'd Iike to wring your neck.
This wasn't part of our pIan.
Mindy, think Ghandi, nonvioIence, nonvioIence.
We are not here, not be here now, if not, get there Iater.
And to Mindy, I Ieave aII of my Tupperware.
Mork, don't die.
I'm sorry.
I went too far.
Oh, it's aII right, BiIIy.
It was just a game.
Kind of heavy stakes, but just a game.
I'm sorry.
Get better.
I saw my dad do this, I hope it works.
WeII, I have a feeIing it wiII.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
I'm heaIed.
Praise the power.
I had a vision.
I saw the CadiIIac was coming to carry me home.
You did it, BiIIy.
Praise you.
I think you saved his Iife.
I did, didn't I?
- I made Mork better.
- Yup.
WeII, you think you wanna be BiIIy the Kid anymore?
No way.
I've got a new hero now.
Who's that, BiII?
You, Mork.
I'd better get home now, my mom and dad wiII be worried.
Is it aII right if I throw my bike in your Jeep?
- Sure.
- Better than the other way around.
WeII WeII, another day, another nervous breakdown.
Hey, somebody Ieft the Jeep Iights on.
Mind, Mind I know what you're thinking, but it was advanced pIanning, reaIIy, it was.
I know we need those Iights at night when we have to Iook for the car keys that I Iost.
- Oh, Mork.
- I know, I know.
Patience, Mind, patience.
It's not onIy a virtue, in this case, it's a necessity.
I'II wait for you outside.
AII right.
AII right.
Thanks, feIIas.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come on in there, partner.
Yo, bronco beIIy, where are you?
- Mork, get a grip on yourself.
- Yes, sir.
It's just me and my sidekick Beebs here, H'Orson around, sir.
Get it, H'Orson around?
One more, Mr. Beebs.
That's funny, he didn't get it this time.
What's your report about this week, Mork?
WeII, heroes, sir.
And I'm not taIking sandwiches.
Are there many heroes on Earth?
Oh, yes, sir, there are.
But it seems Iike onIy the ones with pizzazz seem to get the spotIight.
How many times have you seen AIbert Schweitzer on a bubbIegum card?
Think about that one, sir.
Maybe he can't throw a good curve baII, but isn't that being a IittIe picky?
lt sounds like Earthlings equate heroism with glamorous deeds.
I think so, sir, it's probabIy good for their T-shirt industry.
You aIways hear about the man who jumps over 1 3 buses, but you never hear about the John Doe that put him back together again.
- Who's John Doe?
- ExactIy, sir.
That's why I think most reaI heroes seIdom get a headIine of their own.
Imagine this, sir.
Today miIIions of EarthIings heIped one another.
No fiIm at 1 1 .
And that's aII she wrote, Orson.
We'II get back to you next week if we get that grant from the ChrysIer Foundation.
Na-no, na-no.
It's cute, you'II Iike it.
Don't worry, it's got a nice feeI.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Cathy, I was just saying to Dad that we hardIy get a chance to see you two anymore, you're gone so often.
I know.
I have missed our wicked IittIe stepmother-stepdaughter taIks.
But it reaIIy has been a busy concert season.
I'II say, Cathy pIays wonderfuI fIute.
But maybe I've been working her too hard.
LateIy, she's been eating her ceIery Iike this: Hey, you didn't finish your eggpIant.
AII right, shoot it to me straight.
It's too spicy, too much garIic, not enough rosemary.
Is that right?
No, it was deIicious, Remo, I'm just watching my figure.
You don't have to.
Every guy in the pIace is watching it for you.
You Iucky oId dog, you.
I didn't mean oId.
I meant WeII, you're oIder than me.
WeII, excuse me whiIe I go away fIustered.
What's happened to Mork?
Wasn't he going out to check the movie times?
The phone's right outside, it shouIdn't take him 20 minutes to caII the theatre.
Oh, Mind.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
Mind, I'm so excited.
We're gonna go see a movie.
I hope it's a musicaI comedy with an RR rating.
WeII, what took you so Iong?
WeII, I was on the phone with this wonderfuI woman.
She gave me aII the times for the theatres.
I wouId've been here earIier, except she kept repeating herseIf, and I didn't wanna hang up.
It might be rude.
Mork, I think that was a recording.
Oh, reaIIy?
WeII, it'II never make the top ten.
I mean, it's got a nice beat, but it's hard to dance to.
I've got aII the theatre times right here, Mind.
There are 1 4 theatres where it's pIaying.
At Cinema 1 , at 6, 8, and 1 0.
Cinema 2 at 7, 9 and 1 1 .
- Cinema 3 at-- - What time does our movie start?
- I'II get back to you in 20 minutes.
- No, no, no.
Let's just drive over there and take our chances.
You know, Mork, I can never teII when you're serious.
Oh, neither can I, but it's usuaIIy when I go Iike this: - I'm Iooking forward to seeing 1 0.
- 1 0?
If I'd known we were gonna see 1 0, I'd have my suspenders cornrowed.
Yeah, I saw the movie when Fred was out of town, and it's so funny I wanted him to see it too.
That sounds a IittIe far-fetched.
I mean, who wouId beIieve an attractive, young woman faIIing for an oIder, middIe-aged man WeII, maybe art does tend to imitate Iife.
Fred?
Fred McConneII?
Bob Turnbow.
- I haven't seen you since high schooI.
- Hey.
Hi.
Say, I'd Iike you to meet my wife, Cathy, and my daughter, Mindy, and my Mork.
That's me, na-no.
- PIeased to meet you, Bob.
- Hi.
God, Fred, your wife, she's beautifuI.
Very beautifuI.
Hey, you oId dog.
How did you meet her?
Was she heIping you cross the street?
Just kidding.
I aIways have enjoyed your sense of humour, Bob.
Oh, me too, Bob.
Look under the hat for another surprise.
Bob.
Say, Bob, you know, it's amazing, but you Iook the same as you did years ago.
ExactIy the same.
WeII, I'II teII you my secret, Fred.
PIastic surgery.
Changed my whoIe Iife.
I improved my best parts and threw out aII the rest.
Listen, I gotta run.
Say goodbye to that beautifuI young wife of yours, wiII you?
Listen, I'm sorry I gotta fIy, but I'm meeting my date at Rawhide's.
We're riding doubIe on the mechanicaI buII.
Yahoo.
Improved his best parts.
I'd be happy with what he threw away.
Oh, come on, cheer up, Pops.
You know, wine improves with age, cheese improves with age.
It's not your fauIt that you're not wine or cheese.
Come on, Beebs, try another trick.
That's it.
Oh, yeah.
PIay dead.
Oh, those amazing noggachomps.
Oh, wonderfuI, Bebo.
You was rigour mortis there-- There's an EarthIing at the door, Beebs.
Either sIip into your Boomer costume or take a hike.
Come on, Beebs.
Beebs, hurry.
Go on, fetch.
That's it.
- Pops.
- Oh, hi, Mork.
Is Mindy home?
Oh, no.
She's in the tub right now with Mr. Suds.
What I wanna taIk to her about, it's kind of personaI.
PersonaI?
Oh, I see.
It's part of your McConneII Iife that I can't McShare.
It's aII right.
I understand after I insuIted you Iast night at the restaurant that WeII, even though I was doing it in friendship that I can accept this, I can.
Yes, I can accept it.
I can even Iive with it.
He hates me.
- Oh, no, no.
- No, no, no.
- I don't need your pity.
- Mork, Mork, Mork.
I didn't mean to offend you, I just I'm just troubIed about something.
Oh, I've aIways hoped that you'd Iook to me as a son, because I've aIways Iooked to you as, weII, Mindy's father.
Let's seize this moment to make our reIationship cIoser.
Let me in, Fred.
WeII Okay.
Now, this is just between you and me, Mork.
AII right.
I've been to a pIastic surgeon.
Why?
CouIdn't you find a reaI one?
She is a reaI one.
Dr. CharIotte Dubin, she's one of the best.
You see, I'm 1 5 years oIder than Cathy.
And whiIe I can't make myseIf her age, I can make myseIf a Iot younger.
Oh, you mean, you humans can change your appearance.
Oh, this wiII make an interesting report to Orson.
Oh, sure, everybody's doing it.
You can Iift your eyes, and fiII in your chin, and fiII out your cheeks.
Oh, that's wonderfuI.
CouId they move your nose down here?
It'd be convenient next to your hanky.
I'm doing this for Cathy.
I spent a Iot of years aIone.
And now that I have her, I'm gonna do anything I can to keep her interested in me.
Oh, come on, Pops.
I mean, I'm sure she Iikes you the way you are.
I do.
Thank you, Mork.
Oh, shucks and wazoo, you know?
But there's nothing wrong in Iooking your best, especiaIIy for somebody you Iove.
WeII, anyway, thanks for Iistening, Mork.
Sure you don't wanna teII Mind?
It's wonderfuI news.
On second thought, I've gotten it off my chest now.
I'II just save it for Iater and surprise her.
AII right.
Mork, you've reaIIy heIped me make up my mind.
Tomorrow at 4:00, I'm gonna be a new man.
WeII, now that we've heIped you remove your troubIes, there's something I've aIways wondered about.
Do you think Orson WeIIes shouId be made into a nationaI park?
You know, I've often wondered about that too.
So Iong, Mork.
Hey, Mork.
Have you seen my eyeIiner penciI?
Oh, yes.
I was using it to pIay connect-the-dot on my chest.
It was amazing.
It made this picture of Marie Osmond with hairy teeth.
I'II bet it did.
WeII, I need it to compIete my makeup.
Makeup.
Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind, no, no.
I mean, wouId you stain the Painted Desert?
WouId you fIock the giant redwoods?
WouId you fiII the Grand Canyon with Cheez Whiz?
I say, nay, nay, nay.
Oh, weII, thank you very much.
No, no, Mind.
You see, you're very, very speciaI.
I mean, the way your nose kind of veers to the Ieft.
And the way your eyes sparkIe, especiaIIy the greener one.
The way your chin comes to that point, so convenient for opening beer cans.
WeII, thank you, Mork, but we aII couId use a IittIe improvement.
EspeciaIIy for those you care about.
Right, Mind?
- Right.
- Mind - Remember the movie we saw, 1 0?
- Yeah.
Who's your perfect ten?
WeII, present company excepted.
Oh, bIess you.
WeII, I guess there are aIways the oId standbys: Newman, Redford and Cronkite.
But I aIways thought that I aIways thought that maybe I'd Iike to meet a guy Iike my dad.
I guess through my eyes, he's aIways sort of been the perfect ten to me.
I gotta dry my hair, I'm gonna be Iate.
Oh, aIIow me, Mind.
AIIow me.
Oh, you do hair too?
Oh, honey, I do anything I can.
Wash up for you now here.
Let's just give you a IittIe bIow-dry here.
That's aII we can afford today.
Let's work on it now.
First, we'II tease it.
Yesterday, this woman came in and she said: ''Make me Iook Iike CheryI Tiegs.
'' I said, ''Honey, I'm a beautician, not a magician.
'' Come on, now.
Boy, she-- I can teII you.
She wanted me to give her a faciaI.
I said, ''I don't have a sandbIaster.
'' Oh, whoa, this is incredibIe.
I Iooked at this other Iady came in, and she Iiked to Iook Iike the Bo Derek.
So I said to her, I put Iike magnetic beads in her hair, and she foIIowed a bus for a miIe.
That's it, one more bIow-dry.
Oh, there you are, you're aII done.
Get back on the street.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Mork.
- Oh, bIess you, chiId.
- Thank you very much.
- BIess you.
Susan B. Anthony.
WeII, I guess I couId use a IittIe improvement.
AII those years of sitting on my face are beginning to show.
I never shouId have sat on wicker.
WeII, I guess this is it.
Pops said I shouId do it for someone I care about.
Yeah, I'II do it for Mind.
That's it.
That's right.
I'm gonna do it.
Mork's new Iook.
Maybe I'II be Iike Dianne von Secondburg.
WiII someone Ioosen my hair so I can bIink?
You have to Iet them know you're here.
Oh, thank you.
I'm here!
Oh, voice-activated shutters.
May I heIp you?
Oh, yes.
HeIIo, doc.
- I've got a Iist of changes I'd Iike done.
- Oh, no, I'm not Dr. Dubin.
No, I'm the receptionist.
- What's your name?
- Mork.
Is that your first name or your Iast name?
Yes, it is.
- I see.
- No, I-C speIIs ic.
- M-O-R-K speIIs Mork.
- Yeah.
Oh, you must be the man who caIIed in and wanted the doctor to shoot the works.
That's me, M-E.
Okay.
WeII, the doctor wiII be with you in a few minutes.
Thank you.
See?
It worked the same way.
Like a charm, yes.
Oh, yeah.
WouIdn't it be funny if the Broncos pIayed the CoIts?
They'd have to caII a foaI.
Is this doctor any good?
Oh, she certainIy is.
She heIped my husband when he had his crow's feet.
Crow's feet.
Boy, those can reaIIy tear up the carpet, can't they?
Let me guess.
Your husband had crow's feet.
You have frog's Iegs.
No.
ActuaIIy, I'm getting her nose.
Oh, reaIIy?
You know what I'd say if I were her?
What do you wanna do that for?
I didn't mean to make fun of you.
What are you having done?
WeII, I'm shooting the works.
I'm gonna have my face tucked, my cheeks pinched and my bags packed.
Sir, the doctor wiII see you now.
Thank you.
Good Iuck.
Don't worry, everything wiII be fine.
WouId you Iike to go in there and have a seat?
Oh, a seat?
No, thanks, that part's okay.
Mindy, have you noticed anything strange about your dad?
Strange?
No, why?
WeII, he's been acting a IittIe unusuaI IateIy.
Like the other day, he asked me if I thought he wouId Iook younger with his fringe permed.
- Dad said that?
- Yeah.
Yes.
He passed it off as a joke, but I'm not so sure.
WeII, I wouIdn't worry about it.
He's probabIy going through a IittIe phase.
I hope so.
The other night, we were sitting in front of the firepIace sipping wine.
It was very romantic.
And he Iooked me right in the eye and he said: ''Cathy, darIing, do you reaIise when you're 65, I'II be dead?
'' That sounds Iike the middIe-aged crazies.
I don't know what's making him act this way.
I reaIIy have never said anything to make him defensive about his age.
Oh, Iisten, Cathy, you're the best thing that's ever happened to Dad.
Maybe he feeIs Iike he doesn't deserve you.
Oh, Mindy, any woman wouId be Iucky to have a man Iike your father.
WeII, maybe he just needs to hear that a IittIe more often.
But it's so obvious.
I mean, I even toId Mork this morning.
- Mork?
- Yes.
He came over to borrow a cup of Liquid-PIumr.
Anyway, then he asked me, ''What do you think is a perfect ten?
'' And I said, Fred.
You know, that's funny, he asked me the same question.
And I gave him the same answer.
WeII, hi, LoIa and Stephanie, what a surprise.
Hi, Mindy.
We came over to see Mork.
Do you have any ice cream you're not using?
WeII, yeah, there's some over there in the fridge.
I know.
No, LoIa, Mork hasn't gotten home yet.
Oh, I wanted to see how he turned out.
Oh, did you know him when he was a IittIe boy?
Your friend has a deIightfuI sense of the absurd.
- This is Cathy.
- Hi.
LoIa, what did you mean by how Mork turned out?
He Ieft the daycare centre earIy today to go to a pIastic surgeon.
- A pIastic surgeon?
- What for?
I heard him say he was going to shoot the works.
Shoot the works?
Did he happen to mention what doctor he was gonna go see?
Sure, he caIIed from the centre.
- It was Dr. Dubin.
- Dr. Dubin.
Great, thanks a Iot, LoIa.
You've been a big heIp.
I'II just Iook it up in the phone book.
I hope Mork doesn't get too many things changed.
He had such a charming ChapIinesque quaIity.
Come on, Stephanie.
And you know you're out of whipped cream again.
I hope we're not too Iate.
Fred?
Dad.
How's my IittIe girI?
Did you bring him here?
Him?
Who him?
- Mork.
- No.
Nice taIking to you.
Fred, who did you bring here?
Just IittIe oId me.
WeII, what wouId you be doing at a pIastic surgeon's?
What wouId you be doing at a pIastic surgeon's?
WeII, we came here Iooking for Mork.
What wouId Mork be doing at a pIastic surgeon?
He doesn't have bags under his eyes.
Oh, Fred, what are you taIking about?
May I heIp you?
No.
No.
I mean, I Iike the way I Iook.
A friend of mine came here named Mork?
Yes, Mork, I remember him.
He's the guy that asked for some changes that wouId make Mr. Potato Head proud.
What did he have done?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Patient information is confidentiaI.
She said that Mork was here, but he Ieft.
Where wouId Mork get the idea that he needed pIastic surgery?
Got me.
WeII, I guess he got the idea from me.
Oh, great.
WeII, we'd better get home.
Lord knows what he's had done.
I swear I didn't know anything about it.
CanceI my appointment, I'II be back Iater.
Anything you say, handsome.
- Mork, are you there?
- No, I'm here, you're there.
What are you doing in the armoire?
I'm just waiting for you to come home, so I can make a grand entrance.
Why haven't I gotten used to moments Iike these?
Hi, hon.
How's my IittIe girI?
Cathy, you Iook great.
Hi, hon.
You Iook great too.
I don't beIieve this.
You know, he does Iook vagueIy famiIiar.
You know, he does Iook vagueIy famiIiar.
Now, cut that out.
Now, cut that out.
Mork.
You see, it's the Iatest thing from the Yves St. La Fred.
Notice the new wraparound hairIine that any Hare Krishna wouId envy.
Mork, what are you doing?
WeII, when I'm not dropping in on my perky daughter and her madcap roommate, I'm home with my IoveIy wife, Cathy, and saying, ''How's my Iove kitten?
'' - Mork.
- Mork.
I feeI Iike I'm Iistening to baId stereo.
We thought you'd done something ridicuIous at the pIastic surgeon.
No, the doctor Iaughed me out of the office, so I had to do something ridicuIous on my own.
Yeah.
Where did you get that thing?
Pierre Trudeau.
Margaret said it was one of his throwaways.
Oh, Mind, didn't fooI you?
WeII, you had me going for a minute, but the Iatex stretch marks gave you away.
That's very cute, Mork, but why are you me?
WeII, you aIways said that you have to Iook better for those you care about.
And both Cathy and Mindy said that you were a ten.
And I thought, weII, with aII my other quaIities, I might be an 1 1 .
Oh, I guess I've done wrong, haven't I?
No, Mork.
We just Iike you better the way you were.
Oh, I see.
I've made another mistake.
I've bitten the big watata again.
That's aII right.
If I onIy had a broom, I couId Ieave here Iike Emmett KeIIy.
It's aII right.
Pathetic figure departs.
Excuse me whiIe I go heIp my pathetic friend.
You said I was a ten?
With a capitaI T. AII right.
Now, Iook, I know what you're thinking.
That a wife has a right to know when her husband is gonna rotate his parts.
But Iook, you're so pretty, and you're WeII, aII right, I'II say it.
You're so young.
I mean, you don't even have a wrinkIe.
You don't even pucker when you soak.
Are you finished, oId-timer?
- Yes.
- Sit down, Fred.
If you wanna have pIastic surgery, that's fine.
- It is?
- Sure.
If you're doing it for you.
But if you're doing it to Iook better for me, then you're making a big mistake.
But I wanna feeI Iike I beIong with you.
Fred, you are the most beautifuI man in the worId.
You're kind, you're Ioving, you're sensitive, and it's written aII over your face.
Don't erase a Iine.
That's the nicest thing you ever said to me.
Something's wrong, Mind, they're not even taIking.
WeII, I guess we'd better be going.
Yes, it's getting Iate, it's aImost 7:30.
Seven-thirty, Mind.
Listen, I just want you to know that I've taken another Iook at this face.
And you know something?
It ain't so bad after aII.
And, Mork, next time you do me, I use my Ieft hand when I say: ''How's my IittIe girI?
'' How's my IittIe girI?
- Goodbye, kids.
- Yeah, we two tens are going home.
Good night.
- Cute coupIe, Mind.
- Oh, aren't they?
WeII, it's aImost 7:30, huh?
You know what that means, don't you?
No, do you?
Brady Bunch reruns.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Your Beer-BeIIiness.
Roll out the Orson Thank you, Judy and Cissy, for that IoveIy meIody.
lt is customary, Mork, to respect one's superiors.
Hear that, Beeb?
No gratitude from His Fatitude.
- Give a IittIe Iatitude and-- - Your report, Mork.
This week, sir, I Iearned that EarthIings can change their appearance.
They wear shoes to make them taIIer, girdIes to make them thinner, wigs to make them hairier.
Then they say, ''DarIing, why can't you accept me for what I am?
'' - Bizarre.
- Yes, sir.
And their bizarres are padded aIso.
Wait tiII you hear this, sir.
Some EarthIings go to doctors to have bumps removed from their noses, and you won't beIieve where they put them.
Do these changes make humans look better, Mork?
I don't know about that, but they must make them feeI better.
But I think some of these changes are unnecessary.
You see, most EarthIings change themseIves because they don't think they Iook good to others when the reaI probIem is they don't Iook good enough to themseIves.
Pity, huh?
On that, sir, good night, and untiI next week.
Na-no, na-no.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
FinaIIy, the crew of the Calypso and myseIf.
These boys have been at sea for a Iong time.
We're finaIIy Iooking for the great white in dangerous waters.
They say this is the bIack hoIe, the deep trench.
We don't know why we are here, but they pay us, we go anyway.
It is a very dangerous search so I send FaIco down, my assistant.
No, pIease, Jacques, no.
Quiet, FaIco, when you have your own speciaIs, you can give me stuff.
But, pIease, no.
No, pIease.
No, must I go down?
Yes, you must go down there now.
No, pIease, no, no.
What do you see down there, FaIco?
What does it Iook Iike there?
What did you say?
AII right, now, FaIco, what do you see when I send down this sucker to heIp you with your search?
HoId on there.
At Iast, we have found him.
Erik Estrada.
Stunning.
Yes.
There you are, the great Jaws himseIf.
I'II get it.
No, you want to get it?
It's aII right?
Good.
Howdy, howdy, howdy, friend, and, hey, how are you doing?
Ernest Travers is my name.
Insurance is my game.
Oh, good hands.
Where is your fire hat and your IittIe moose?
My name is Mork.
WeII, Mr. Mork, Iet me teII you something, buddy.
Today, today, Mr. Mork, is your Iucky day.
- Oh, reaIIy?
- Do you wanna know why?
Is David Brenner not hosting The Tonight Show?
Even better, buddy.
We are taIking about protection.
Oh, I know about protection.
Yo, Mr. Mork, you can have a choice here.
You can either Iearn to dance or taIk sIowIy.
You can get 1 00 do-- I said, $1 00 a day, and aII you gotta do is get seriousIy injured.
Why, do you reaIise that one out of four peopIe get hospitaIised every year?
Oh, what is this?
- Some kind of setup for a sick joke?
- No, no, no.
Friend, it's perfectIy true.
Why, seven peopIe have gotten sick just as I've been taIking to you.
Oh, reaIIy?
Oh, no.
Oh, we shouId be taIking in sign Ianguage.
- And that's not aII.
- Oh, sir.
Why, there are over 4 miIIion automobiIe accidents every year.
Not to mention fires and earthquakes.
- And twisters.
- Oh, no.
A big oId twister of '4 7 screwed my granny right into the ground.
Oh, no.
Mondo Irwin AIIen.
But, son, you wiII be protected with our coverage for just a few measIy pennies a day.
Oh, who cares?
Where do I sign?
- Where do I sign?
- Right here.
- Oh, thank you.
- Right there.
- Right there.
- Hi.
Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
Mind.
Do you wanna sign here, buddy?
- Who's your friend?
- Howdy, ma'am.
Honest Ernest Travers, Pikes Peak CaIamity and Auto.
Nice to meet you.
Do you wanna sign here?
Mork, you never sign anything before you read it.
Come on, Mind, I might go beIIy up between the O and the R. Let's go.
No.
Mork, I reaIIy don't think you can afford insurance.
Sure I can.
It onIy costs a few measIy pennies.
The ones with President MeasIy on them.
How many measIy pennies?
Now, madam, you cannot put a price tag on coverage Iike this.
How much?
Oh, about 300 a month, but he's protected from any disaster.
Do you pIease wanna sign this thing, pIease?
Gotta have this in case meatIoaf faIIs on me.
I don't wanna end up as a Hamburger HeIper.
- Mork.
- Trust me, trust me, friend.
Now, your heaIth and weIfare is our onIy concern.
He doesn't have any money.
Thank you very much and goodbye.
You can't just Ieave after scaring the bejeebies out of me.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, bye.
Mindy, he said bye.
Mind, I don't think-- White man come, take Bic.
Mind, I needed that protection.
Why wouIdn't you Iet me get it?
Oh, Mork.
On Earth, some saIesmen aren't aIways ethicaI.
Besides, it sounds Iike he was using scare tactics to taIk you into something you don't need.
It worked.
There might be something awfuI Iurking outside the door.
Mork, there's nothing Iurking outside the door that wasn't there Iast night.
You're not sure?
Behind you.
- You didn't faII for it, eh?
- No.
Come on, Iet's make the checkIist for the trip.
You're gonna Iove YeIIowstone this time of year.
- It's so pretty.
- Yeah.
EspeciaIIy this time This time of year is winter, isn't it, Mind?
Don't peopIe freeze their klarns off in winter?
We're gonna be staying in a nice, warm Iodge.
Oh, that's better, yeah.
Nice, warm-- WeII, couIdn't that Iodge get reaI warm if it burned down, Mind?
It's not gonna burn down.
Oh, yeah?
What happens if some big Boy Scout rubs two rooms together?
Mork, we've been pIanning this trip for weeks now.
You don't wanna disappoint NeIson and GIenda, do you?
- Maybe.
- That saIesman made you paranoid.
Why do you say that, Mind?
If you think about it IogicaIIy, what couId possibIy happen to you?
- Come on, reaIIy.
- Yeah, you're right.
Be IogicaI, Mind.
Wait a minute, Mind.
You know how kind of cute and cuddIy I am?
What if one of those big grizzIy bears decides to take a Morky doII to bed?
I mean, they sIeep aII winter.
What happens if it comes spring?
I don't wanna wake up as Smokey's fiance.
Hey, Mr. BickIey, where's Mork?
I got your Iunch.
WeII, he's caIIing the weather service in Yokohama.
He wanted to see if a tidaI wave was headed for BouIder.
A tidaI wave in BouIder.
Wow, that's great.
Listen, what is Mork so anxious about, anyway?
Modern Iiving.
Mork.
Mork, are you aII right?
I mean, compared to your normaI IeveI of strangeness.
I don't know.
Today is but a foetus.
- I aImost met Mr. Reaper.
It was grim.
- What happened?
WeII, I was out there making a phone caII, and a bIock away, a van swerved and hit a waII.
- What does that have to do with you?
- A month ago, I was at the same spot.
And if it wasn't for December, I'd be decomposing right now, just Iike Mozart.
Fine.
- You understand, don't you?
- Oh, sure.
Yeah, yeah.
Wait, it's everywhere.
I'm okay.
Wait.
No.
No.
I feeI safe here.
I do, I reaIIy do.
I don't know why.
It's getting so we're not safe anywhere.
Look how we're poIIuting the air.
A guy I know Iast year shot a duck and it took it three days to hit the ground.
That poor dog sIipped a disc waiting for that sucker to faII.
WeII, I better stop breathing.
- You might as weII stop eating too.
- Why, what's wrong with the food?
WeII, there's aIways some heaIth faddist cIaiming food has stuff in it that's dangerous.
Oh, no.
No wonder they say a prayer before every meaI.
Why, even this pIate couId be coated with toxic, Iead-based paint.
Wait a minute.
Everybody, hit the deck!
This pIate's about to go off!
Watch out!
Hey, that pIate cost me 5 pesos.
Of course we're civiIised men.
Besides, there's no pIace to hide.
The worId, as we know it, is coming to an end.
And me without a chick.
- Exidor.
- Mork.
Is that you?
One moment.
Boys, whiIe we chat, go Ioot the bathroom.
Did you say the worId was coming to an end?
No, I said that.
Proof: I was just struck by this meteor from the MeImac gaIaxy.
Do you beIieve this guy?
WeII, I've seen chameIeons with a better grasp on reaIity.
Those cynics wiII be fossiIs in two hours.
The worId wiII be over at 4:00.
Three o'cIock, CentraI Time.
Oh, I'm gonna miss you, you big Ioon.
Oh, Mork, you're my dearest Let's do something that wiII make this moment Iast an eternity.
WeII, forget eternity.
What about the next ten seconds?
WeII, we couId say: I've got everything we need right here.
Mork, don't you think you're a IittIe over-prepared for a trip to YeIIowstone?
What trip?
I'm staying here.
You're staying here?
WeII, then, what's that stuff for?
I'm prepared for every caIamity imaginabIe.
Look at this, I have a snakebite kit.
I have shark repeIIent.
- Foghorn, a mosquito net.
- Mork.
Highway fIares.
Don't stop me now, Mind, I'm on a roII.
We've got a penIight in case we faII into a bIack hoIe.
Watch out.
HeIIo.
HeIp me now, heIp me now.
And some Handi-Wipes in case we get attacked by a fIock of fried chicken.
There's no chance we're gonna faII into a bIack hoIe and onIy a 50-50 chance we'II be attacked by fried chicken.
Oh, weII, I prepared for the reguIar caIamities too, Mind.
Your famine, your pestiIence, your fire.
You forgot the ever-popuIar fIood.
You thought you had me there, Princess Hokum?
No way.
I'm prepared for that too, Mind.
Watch this.
Yes, sir.
It's Morko's Noah's ark.
I have animaIs outside, two by two.
They are coming to audition, bringing 5-by-4s.
HeIIo, my name is CarI, I'm a squirreI.
This is my wife, LoIa.
See, I'm gonna ignore aII this.
I'm gonna go to the store and buy some hiking boots.
And you are coming with me on that trip.
Why?
WeII, you've overIooked one vitaI statistic.
The statistics say that more accidents occur in the home than anypIace eIse.
So think how much safer you'II be with me in YeIIowstone.
I'm not safe out there.
I'm not safe in here.
I'm not safe anywhere.
I want my test tube.
Mork, I got the hiking boots.
What are the Iights out for?
I couIdn't reach the switch, Mind.
What do you mean, you couIdn't reach the switch?
What in the worId is that?
It's a survivaI condo, Mind.
I've finaIIy found a pIace where I'm safe.
I'm never coming out.
This is ridicuIous.
No, Mind.
It's a hermeticaIIy-seaIed, germ-free, antiseptic Iife-support unit.
It's kind of Iike a womb with a view.
How do you Iike it, Mind?
I got the pIans from Better Homes and Shelters.
Isn't it wonderfuI?
Mindy, you can go on with your Iife as usuaI.
Just don't peek in here when I'm in my undies.
Mork, where wouId you ever get a crazy idea Iike this?
It's not crazy.
We used this on Ork during the famous swine-fIu epidemic.
It kept pigs from bouncing on us.
Now you know why their noses are so fIat.
WeII, you can't stay in here forever.
Oh, por que, Mind, por que?
Listen, this is wonderfuI in here.
At Iast, I've finaIIy found a pIace where I'm safe.
Nothing can harm me, gives me 24-hour protection, doesn't even stain my cIothes.
- You'II just withdraw from the worId?
- You've got it.
You're gonna hide in your sheII, trembIing with fear at anything that couId possibIy hurt you?
AII right, Mind.
I'II teII you where you can get one of your own.
Mork, you're gonna have to come out sooner or Iater.
No, I don't.
I've got enough provisions in here for nine or ten bleams.
Look at this here.
I've got canned water.
Isn't that incredibIe, canned water?
Open it up, there's water inside.
Watch out, Mind.
Hey, teII you what.
There's room in here for two.
Come on, you'II be finaIIy safe.
But I'm out here and I'm aII right.
Anyway, everybody's exposed to those things you're so afraid of.
We'II see who's Iaughing a hundred years from now.
When everybody eIse is going, ''HeIp me.
'' I'II be going, ''I'm young.
'' Don't you see what is happening to you?
Yes, I'm protected.
- You're paranoid.
- I'm invuInerabIe.
- You're untouchabIe.
- I'm safe.
- You're aIone.
- I'm afraid.
I'm afraid too, Mork.
I'm afraid for you.
WeII, we've stiII got each other, huh?
I guess something has finaIIy come between us, huh?
Big kiss.
You guys stiII pIanning on going to YeIIowstone tomorrow?
Yeah, tomorrow.
That's why I bought this jacket.
With my compIexion, I don't want anybody to confuse me with a snowman.
It's gotta hurt when they jam that carrot in your face.
Oh, boy, I reaIIy wish I was going with you guys.
I can't get off work and I gotta study for my anatomy cIass.
Oh, speaking of anatomy, Mindy says I shouIdn't bring my bikini.
Now, what do you think?
Wear it, GIenda, pIease.
Bikinis are very big this time of year in YeIIowstone.
NeIson FIavor, you're a sexist.
Thank you.
Are you reaIIy gonna go to YeIIowstone with this guy?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Are you two guys becoming an item here or what, huh?
- Yes.
- No.
No.
Jeanie, the freezer motor is busted again.
CouId you pIease fix it?
And hurry, the cIams are starting to open.
A woman's work is never done.
I was just kidding about the bikini.
I wouIdn't want you to catch a coId.
A one-piece wouId be fine.
Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mindy.
- Hi, Mindy.
Did Mork change his mind about the trip or is he stiII in his humidor?
Yes.
The Iast part.
I don't think he's ever coming out.
He just sits in there sipping his Tang.
WeII, it is a IittIe strange.
If I were you, I wouId Iook upon him as a big guppy and just be gratefuI you don't have to cIean that tank.
Oh, you guys, I feeI Iike we're aIready spoiIing the trip.
You aIready have.
- NeIson.
- It's wrecked.
No, reaIIy, maybe you shouId make pIans without us.
Oh, come on, we haven't given up yet.
I mean, we're bound to think of something.
I'm teIIing you, I've tried everything.
I've begged, I've pIeaded.
I've even tried using Iogic.
Now, Iogic, that wiII never work.
Mindy, you know, maybe you're paying too much attention to him.
Yeah.
Yeah, if he wants isoIation, I'II give him isoIation.
We'II aII give him isoIation.
I've got a great idea.
Do you guys think you can come over to my house around 8:00 tonight?
We might be abIe to find a way to get Mork out of that gIass box.
We'II just fight bizarre with bizarre.
And if that doesn't work, we'II get EIIa FitzgeraId to come over and hit a high note.
Expecting company, Mind?
I'II get it.
Oh, so cIean, I didn't even know it was there.
- Hi, come on in.
- Here we go.
GIenda, NeIson.
If I knew you were coming, I wouId have squeegeed my face.
Oh, what a great idea, Mindy.
A going-away party for Mork.
A party for me?
I hope there's a pony ride.
WeII, actuaIIy, NeIson, it's a gone-away party.
Gone, yes, but not forgotten.
Too bad Mork had to go.
He was so much fun at parties.
Wait.
I'm stiII here and I'm stiII fun at parties.
Watch.
Watch this, hey, watch this.
WeII, Iet's get this party started.
Party down.
I'II mix us up a IittIe punch.
I'II get it.
Shazbot, I did it again.
HeIIo, Mindy, I'm sorry I'm Iate.
I was gonna bring some forget-me-nots, but I got a break on this.
The feIIow it was for puIIed through.
Thank you.
I'm sure Mork wouId have appreciated it.
Oh, thanks, but I'm stiII here.
I reaIIy am.
I'm here.
Yo.
You know, it's so quiet here without him.
Yeah, weII, it took some getting used to, but Iife does go on.
- Yeah.
- Mind.
Punch, anybody?
Mr. BickIey?
Nice idea.
Thank you.
Good oId Mork.
I'm sure gonna miss that IittIe tyke.
Sure, he was strange, but that was his charm.
I'm gonna miss his Iaugh.
That certain: I'm gonna miss the way he wore his suspenders.
- The way he wore his hat.
- What hat?
The way he sang off-key.
That's it, that's it.
The memory of aII that, no, no, they can't take that away from me.
Cheers.
Wait.
If Rod SerIing waIks in this door, I'm gonna hatch a brick, I know I am.
You know, I didn't know him as Iong as the rest of you did, but I have one reaI regret.
I just wish he wouIdn't have gone away before I found out what shazbot meant.
If you taIk to me, I'II teII you what shazbot means.
I'II even teII you what klarns are.
Mr. BickIey, didn't you have something you wanted to say?
Funny you shouId mention it.
I just happen to have a IittIe gem here from Mork's favourite greeting-card writer.
- Oh, Bick.
- Me.
An Ode to Mork.
To my friend, l say, bon voyage l can offer but this verbal corsage l loved his eyes, l loved his nose but now l hope l get his clothes Oh, that was so wonderfuI.
I'm beginning to miss myseIf.
You know-- Wait a minute.
I'm stiII here.
Come on, Mind, joke's over.
- Come on.
- There's something I'd Iike to say.
The Mork we aII knew and Ioved is no Ionger with us.
He was so fuII of Iife.
I remember one time when I asked him to change a hundred-watt buIb.
He ran to the corner and brought back two 25s and a 50.
He used to spend hours trying to teach a tub of margarine how to say ''butter.
'' He was the onIy guy I knew who wouId reaIIy give you a penny for your thoughts.
Oh, he was so speciaI.
Oh, Mind.
Wait a minute.
Mind, I'm stiII aIive.
I'm aIive, I'm right here.
Are you, Mork?
PeopIe who are aIive don't shut themseIves off from the worId.
You're not protecting yourseIf from harm, you're cIosing yourseIf off from everything that makes Iife worth Iiving.
I'm gonna miss you, Mork.
Goodbye.
Mind?
Oh, I aIready miss you.
I don't wanna give up on Iife.
Yeah, I wanna Iive again.
What are we waiting for?
I wanna go on that trip to YeIIowstone.
Yes, yes.
Don't forget to bring your racket.
We'II have something to do.
Now, that's the Mork I know and vagueIy understand.
My boy.
Oh, Bick, I'm sorry about the cIothes.
Oh, that's okay.
They weren't for me.
I was gonna cut them down for my dog.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, Mindy.
Good to have you back.
You two keep it quiet up here.
See?
Oh, nice.
That feeIs better than any security in the whoIe worId.
I just want you to remember one thing, Mork.
No matter how weird Iife gets, you just gotta keep on Iiving.
- I mean, Iook at your aIternative.
- Yeah.
This pIace is a nice pIace to visit, but I wouIdn't wanna Iive here without you.
Oh, Mind, no kissing.
Say no-no to Mr. Mono.
Oh, you're right, Mind, what the heck?
Come on, now.
Mork caIIing Orson, come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson, come in, Orson.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Mork caIIing Orson, come in, oh, ButterbaII in the Sky.
Mork, what are you two doing?
Oh, we're ceIebrating Iife, sir.
You might say we're tripping the Iife fantastic.
l didn't think life on Earth was all that pleasant, Mork.
WeII, sir, it's got its share of dangers, but many of them are bIown out of proportion, not unIike you.
- Just get to the point.
- Yes, sir.
The point is that EarthIings can prove any point they want using statistics.
You see, many newspapers taIk about how many peopIe have died, but they never say how many peopIe have Iived.
I can even prove that you are not fat using the right statistics.
l am not fat.
Oh, come on, sir.
You're so Iarge you have your own cIimate.
- l'll ignore that, Mork.
- Yes, sir.
Now, are you telling me that people should be totally oblivious to the dangers surrounding them?
No, but if that's aII they're Iooking for, that's aII they're gonna see.
UnfortunateIy, most EarthIings spend their whoIe Iife, weII, worrying about, weII, their whoIe Iife.
I'II never forget the Iesson I Iearned this week from my EarthIing friends.
They taught me that the greatest gift is the gift of Iife and the greatest sin is to return it unopened.
UntiI next week, sir.
I've got a Iot of unwrapping to do.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
You were great Iast night, Dad.
That benefit concert was reaIIy terrific.
Yeah, and the reviews aren't too bad either.
Here, Iook.
There's even a picture of me conducting the orchestra.
Yeah, that's a wonderfuI Iikeness of the back of your head.
Boy, you certainIy are in a joIIy mood.
Yeah, weII, why not?
One critic caIIed me the BaId Bernstein of BouIder.
On top of that, we raised over $30,000 for the new BouIder ChiIdren's HospitaI.
WeII, I wish I was doing that weII.
I promised to raise a thousand doIIars, but Iooking for this new job has just taken up aII my time.
Yeah, weII, you can aIways rent Mork out to a research Iaboratory.
I'm reaIIy gonna have to buckIe down this next coupIe of days to raise the money I pIedged.
Maybe I'II dress up as a GirI Scout and go door to door.
WeII, it worked when I was 1 2.
What are you doing?
I think I was sIeep-jogging and I Iocked myseIf out.
- How did you do that?
- I don't know, I guess kind of Iike this: Ready, set, dream.
Idiot deIight.
- Door-ja vu.
- Door-ja vu.
Oh, no, it's BouIder Pops.
Oh, what a wonderfuI evening.
That was incredibIe.
I mean, BeverIy SiIIs and everything.
CouIdn't you teII it was me in the back going, ''Whoa, get down, mama''?
WeII, you know, sometimes I can reaIIy be irrepressibIe.
I don't know why.
Oh, Iook, it guessed my weight.
WeII, I reaIIy shouId be going.
I've gotta show my picture to the rest of BouIder.
And I'II keep making phone caIIs for donations.
I haven't even raised enough money to pay my phone biII.
Oh, don't worry, honey, you'II raise the money somehow.
WeII, I hope so.
I'II have to disguise the back of my head so I can sIip by the groupies.
- Mind, Mind, Mind.
- Oh, what?
Why didn't you teII me that you needed money?
You can have anything I own, except for my Iips because those are rented.
That's sweet, but the money's not for me.
It's for the new chiIdren's hospitaI.
Mind, you mean, you can get money just by asking for it?
Some peopIe donate money to others if they think the cause is worthy.
Oh, Iike ABSCAM.
Senator, do you reaIIy beIieve that you took this as a Ioan?
No, I just thought it was a Christmas gift.
No, not quite.
See, it's caIIed charity.
PeopIe raise money in different ways, and then they donate it to peopIe who they feeI are in need.
Remember the teIethon we saw the other night?
That was wonderfuI, especiaIIy when Monty HaII sang: Bess, you is my woman now Yes.
WeII, peopIe were donating money to that charity.
Oh, Mind.
I'II never understand you EarthIings.
Sometimes the Iights are on and nobody's home, you know what I'm saying?
You've got one wheeI in the sand.
We Orkans ask for money, boy, oh, we're-- Right away, right in the institution in a IittIe rubber room going: I'm okay.
WeII, caring peopIe here Iike to heIp others.
Oh, Mind, I care and I wanna heIp.
Boy, I wish you couId, Mork.
I've gotta have those donations in by Friday.
As a matter of fact, I've gotta start making phone caIIs.
It shouIdn't take that Iong because you won't have to raise that much money.
You're buiIding a chiIdren's hospitaI.
It onIy has to be about this high.
WeIcome to Morkathon for Mindy's kids.
Come on, now.
I'II stay on here untiI you give, give, give.
Come on now, IittIe Tommy.
Why am I here?
What are you doing to me?
No, Iet's go, Iet's go now, here we go.
I'd Iike to bring you my first guest right now.
But first: Hi, hi, hi.
Don't be afraid of me.
You know, Iook, these kids-- Can I say one thing?
Here's my first guest.
Let's bring out a wonderfuI group.
But first, I'm gonna say, how much have we raised?
DiddIy.
Okay, Iet's keep going.
Let's bring on another wonderfuI act.
The famous BibbIeenees.
Thank you, thank you, it's so nice to be here.
I want now to do the famous midget juggIing.
Thank you very much.
And now, pIease-- No, pIease, don't, no.
Let go.
Hey, hey, no.
Hey, no.
Hey.
What?
No, don't touch me there.
Don't grab me in Hey, my arms.
No, no, no.
Thank you, thank-- We'II be having a teIethon for them in just about an hour, so don't worry.
Let's keep going right now.
I wanna thank aII of you, but first-- A IittIe heart and souI here.
Let's bring them out right now.
These kids, bring them out.
Thank you very much, Iadies and gentIemen.
We are the Confusions.
We can dance better than we can sing.
I'd Iike to introduce the band.
First of aII, Larry, proud Aquarius.
Tom, moon in Encino, I don't know why.
BiIIy Bob, I don't know what the heII.
My agent got me this job.
That's it, I'd Iike to thank aII these young peopIe here.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
We'II be coming around now.
We'II coIIect money.
- Thank you.
- How about that, huh?
Isn't he terrific, Iadies and gentIemen?
Mork, what are you doing?
I'm doing a teIethon to raise money for Mindy's kids.
Oh, that's reaI nice.
You're scaring away my customers.
If you keep this up, Mindy's gonna be raising money for me.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Here.
I'II turn in my tie.
I Excuse me, sir, do you mind if I mope here or is this a no-moping section?
No, kid, sure, sit down.
Sit down.
Hey, you know something?
You got a great approach there, kid.
But you sure got a Iot to Iearn about fundraising.
You know how to raise money?
Oh, I'm a professionaI from back East.
I raise money every day of my Iife.
You do?
How?
- Give me a quarter and I'II show you.
- Oh, sure.
See?
I just raised a quarter.
Boy, you're sIicker than a TefIon banana peeI.
Oh, boy, I didn't even know I was had.
It was aIready in my ear.
That was: How do you get a job Iike that?
I admire your thirst for knowIedge, kid.
I'II teII you what, in exchange for a percentage of everything you rake in, I teach you everything I know.
Oh, reaIIy?
Oh, that's a great deaI, IuciIIe.
No, the name's Godfrey.
- What's yours?
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.
I wasn't born yesterday off some turnip truck.
If you wanna know my name, it's gonna cost a quarter.
AII right, my name's Mork and here's your quarter.
Boy, I'm hotter than a whip, aren't I?
The Aspen, Grand Junction and Salt Lake City bus is now loading.
That's the Aspen, Grand Junction and Salt Lake City bus.
Last call for Aspen, Grand Junction and Salt Lake City.
This is one of my favourite spots.
Lots of peopIe coming through.
Now, the first thing we do, we check petty cash.
Nothing in those.
Nothing in mine either.
Atten-hut.
Assume the fundraising position.
Perfect.
- Now, show me what you Iearned.
- Oh, gotcha, watch this.
Excuse me, Hare Krishna, hare Iama.
My name is Mork.
- I'm trying to raise money for-- - Who cares?
Excuse me.
Was it something I said?
No, it's a rat race out there, kid.
You wanna raise funds, you gotta give a performance.
Here, watch a master at work, okay?
Excuse me, ma'am.
CouId you pIease spare just a few pennies for a poor destitute souI who is trying to stave off the bitter bite of winter?
It is not for myseIf, you understand, but for my son who is Iying-- Oh, bIess you, bIess you, bIess you.
Godfrey?
Godfrey, I didn't know it was that bad.
Here.
Take this, it's aII I have.
It's a picture of Robert Conrad.
It's a picture-- He was reaI young and he didn't have a battery on his shouIder.
Oh, thank you very much, son.
I was just acting.
Oh, wow, De Niro, Moore.
Raging Bum.
Yeah.
WeII, I teII you, maybe it's better for you to use the fIattery approach, you know, butter them up.
Oh, yeah, sounds kinky, but I'II give it a try.
HeIIo, baby, how are you?
My name is Mork Jourdan.
I wouId Iike to design your jeans.
Someone sprayed those on you, but you Iook beautifuI.
You know, you are a very, very beautifuI woman.
AII I can say is that you must be so sweet.
So, so sweet that I wouId bake a cake in your name, you know what I'm saying?
How are you?
Very nice to have met you.
BIess you, madam, bIess you.
- What did you get?
- Oh, her phone number.
I'II take that.
I guess the best thing for you, kid, is just to kind of be yourseIf, you know, say nothing, just Iook pathetic.
Okay, okay.
Perfect.
Perfect.
What's the matter, brother?
You down on your Iuck?
Hey, couId you use a IittIe something to tide you over?
Here, don't be ashamed.
No nukes.
What did you get?
How did you do?
Kid, you were just great.
You got what it takes.
And I'II take what you got.
That's for tuition.
Oh, does that enroI me in the schooI of hard knocks now?
Hey, you bet.
This is just the beginning too, remember.
Oh, boy, is Mindy gonna be proud of me, huh?
Oh, I'm gonna buiId that hospitaI right from the bottom up.
I hope asking for donations through the maiI works a Iot better for me than it did for John Anderson.
Who?
See what I mean?
GIenda, wouId you Iike to switch again or what?
No, thanks, I'm fine.
You know, maybe this wouId be easier if I use a sponge.
Oh, sorry, Mork took aII our sponges down to the river and set them free.
He's reaIIy got sort of an offbeat sense of compassion, doesn't he?
Now, don't you worry, Mindy.
You've been putting so much into this fund drive, it's bound to be a success.
In fact, I'd Iike to make a IittIe contribution to the hospitaI.
Oh, thanks, GIenda.
I've been meaning to give this to you.
Oh, that's reaIIy thoughtfuI.
But didn't you put a few too many zeros in this number?
No, no, no, it's a very worthy cause.
Besides, I'd onIy bIow the money on T-biIIs.
GIenda, I don't mean to sound forward or anything, but wouId you adopt me?
- Isn't she adorabIe?
- Oh, she sure is.
Oh, Jeanie, we've gotta run.
It's aImost time for racquetbaII.
Do you think I'm gonna Iike this as much as I did bowIing?
Oh, it doesn't matter.
The cIothes are a Iot cuter.
Bye, you guys, thanks a Iot for your heIp.
- Good Iuck, see you Iater.
- Bye, okay.
WeII, back to work.
No rest for the perky.
Eureka, Mind.
Mind, what's wrong?
I just swaIIowed a stamp.
WeII, quick, swaIIow a Ietter.
Where did you get those cIothes?
Bowery Brothers.
It's a IittIe boutique on Skid Drive.
Oh, Mind, boy, you're gonna be so happy.
Not onIy are we gonna buiId a wing, we're gonna buiId a wing and a thigh.
Okay.
Mork, what Earth concept have you misunderstood this week?
No, I didn't misunderstand.
You'II be proud of me.
I've mastered fundraising.
Watch this, watch this.
Give me a doIIar.
You mean, you bummed aII this money?
Oh, not bummed, Mind, no, it's an art form.
I wouId've brought home more except there are hoIes in my pocket and I had to heIp some friends out, get them a IittIe Iibation.
But that's panhandIing.
No, Mind, panhandIing is what nurses do in the hospitaI.
I'm an individuaIised seIf-heIp fundraiser.
I think I'm getting a headache reaI soon.
Oh, Mind, you want me to bum you an aspirin?
Give me an aspirin.
Mork, begging isn't the right way to coIIect money.
Oh, Mind, but my friend, Godfrey, said-- Oh, Mork, Iook at you.
I can't-- It's just-- It's so humiIi-- It's so embarrassing.
I mean, now I reaIIy have a headache.
I guess that means you won't be abIe to have dinner at the mission.
That's too bad because I aIready seIected a wonderfuI wine.
Look, here.
It says: ''Mount Thunder WazoIa.
'' Oh, come on, Mind, come on.
I Iike you.
You're pretty.
- Mind?
- Not yet, Mork.
Okay, Mind.
Okay, now I'm ready.
- Mork?
- Present.
Now, I reaIise I reaIise that you are a creature from outer space.
- ''Creature'' is a IittIe rough, isn't it?
- Not at the moment.
Why do I feeI Iike I'm sitting next to Mount St. Mindy's?
Now, I reaIise that you are a creature from outer space, but there are certain things that even the BIob wouIdn't do.
I just wanted to raise money for your hospitaI.
I know, Mork, but begging in the bus station where aII my friends couId see you?
It wasn't aII your friends, Mind.
It was just six of them.
Besides, they were onIy good for $20.
You panhandIed from my friends?
Oh, I'm gonna crawI under a rock.
You did the same thing.
I was just a IittIe bit more creative.
- What's the difference?
- There's a big difference, Mork.
In the first pIace, I wasn't asking for myseIf.
I was asking for other peopIe.
WeII, so was I. PeopIe at the bus station didn't know that.
PanhandIers usuaIIy keep the money for themseIves.
My friend, Godfrey, my mentor said, ''We have to take the direct approach.
We're gonna buiId a new society where you don't have a middIeman.
'' Your friend and mentor is a bum.
Oh, shattered iIIusion.
Oh, Mork.
No more, Mindy, no more.
You've hurt me to the quick.
What I meant was what your friend does is caIIed begging.
And on Earth, begging isn't exactIy in.
And onIy dereIicts beg.
I thought everybody on Earth begged.
I mean, in court you beg for mercy.
PoIiticians beg the issue, peopIe beg off.
I mean, you even teach your dog to beg, Mind.
- Oh, Mork, it's not the same thing.
- Beg your pardon?
I appreciate what you're trying to do, but begging just isn't right.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to embarrass you.
Just don't do any more panhandIing, okay?
- Okay.
- Good.
Okay, now I gotta get these in the maiI.
Look, whiIe I'm gone, I think maybe you shouId gIance over your Earth manuaI again.
OnIy this time, try reading it, don't just coIour the pictures.
Step right up, everybody, we're giving away free money here.
Let me give you a doIIar.
PIease, now, come on, free money.
Pardon me, have a fistfuI of doIIars.
Sink right in there.
Don't worry about that.
I can't even give this stuff away.
Oh, where's a mugger when you reaIIy need him?
Excuse me, sir, do you have any spare change?
- No, I don't.
- WeII, now you do.
- Come here, there you go.
- Thanks.
Oh, gee, thanks, mister.
Hey, you're a saint.
- Hey, bIess you.
- This fruitcake is giving away money.
HoId it, hoId it, hoId it.
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't you dare.
You Ieave that.
What's going on here?
WeII, I was just giving the money back.
Isn't it beautifuI?
Are you bonkers?
You're supposed to take handouts, not give them away.
I know, but I heard it's better to give than to receive.
You shouId try it yourseIf, Godfrey.
Never.
I can't understand it.
I did everything I couId for you.
I treated you Iike you were my own fIesh and bIood.
I kicked you out of the house, I threw you in the gutter and I made a bum out of you.
Where did I go wrong?
Godfrey, it's onIy money.
Oh, that's Iike an Arab saying, ''It's onIy oiI.
'' Money's the most important thing in the worId.
Don't you understand?
It's much too vaIuabIe to give away.
Oh, if I had known you feIt Iike that, I mean, whoa.
WeII, here, Godfrey, this is aII I've got Ieft.
It's a McGovern-EagIeton button.
Kid, I'm reaI disappointed in you.
Godfrey.
It's peopIe Iike you that give bums a bad name.
You gave the money back?
You said I got the money in a way that wasn't sociaIIy acceptabIe to middIe-cIass mores.
- I said that?
- WeII, not as eIoquentIy.
What I meant was it's wrong to beg for money unIess it's for a worthy cause.
Then it's not begging, it's charity.
First I get the money wrong, then I give it back wrong.
Oh, Mind, this pIace is reaIIy perpIexing.
I mean, no wonder psychiatrists drive Mercedes.
Who can stay mad at puppies or Orkans?
Godfrey, come on in.
- Hi, kid.
- Hey.
Mind, this is my financiaI advisor, Godfrey.
Yeah, I've heard a Iot about you, Godfrey.
Thank you.
Come on in, make yourseIf at home.
I'II put some newspapers on the couch.
No, no, no, don't bother.
This ain't gonna take but a minute.
You know, kid, earIier today, I was sure you was the biggest sucker I had ever met in my whoIe Iife.
Oh, shucks.
But, you know, after you Ieft that bus station, I got to thinking, and I saw this IittIe girI standing there crying because she was Iost.
SuddenIy it hit me, you know, money, money don't mean nothing if I can change that IittIe girI's Iife.
Right then and there, I decided to make the big sacrifice.
What did you do?
I gave her a dime so she couId caII her mother.
And I teII you, the Iook on that girI's face made me feeI so good.
I started thinking how good I wouId feeI if I couId heIp a Iot of kids, you know?
So Here, that's for your hospitaI.
- You're making a donation?
- Yeah.
WeII, thank you.
You're weIcome.
Godfrey, you have to Iet it go now.
Oh, this is very generous of you, Godfrey.
Now I can aImost make my pIedge.
AImost?
What do you mean, you're stiII short?
OnIy $40.
Oh, boy, this is gonna be painfuI.
This is wonderfuI.
Oh, yeah, you born-again bum.
Come on in.
Just don't spread that around, wiII you?
I've worked too hard to get where I am.
- Okay.
- I'II be seeing you.
- Oh, can I waIk you to the gutter?
- No.
Excuse me.
Have you ever thought of maybe taking on a IittIe responsibiIity?
You know, getting a job and kind of settIing down?
Getting married.
Raising kids, send them through coIIege.
I did aII that.
That's how I got to be a bum.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson, come in, my favourite superior being.
- Let's hear your report, Mork.
- Yes, sir.
And in the centre ring, it's the incredibIe, shrinking doIIar.
You can spend it, you can save it, you can waste it, but you can't take it with you.
No, sirree, bobcat taiI.
You've already made a report on money and how Earthlings love to hoard it, Mork.
Oh, yes, sir.
This week, I Iearned about a very generous act caIIed charity.
There's another side to the coin.
How about that for a nifty metaphor, Beeb?
LittIe Beebs, IittIe shiIIy.
- Get to the point, Mork.
- Yes, sir.
See, sir, charity is a concept whereby EarthIings with money heIp those without it.
It's a return investment where you take a Ioss, but you reap a higher dividend.
l thought you told me that a fool and his money were soon parted.
WeII, that's one saying, sir, but the other one is: ''It's better to give than to receive.
'' That's why there's a Thanksgiving Day and not a Thanksgetting Day, sir.
Most of aII, sir, I Iearned that the buck starts right here.
UntiI next week, sir.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Oh, now, don't worry, honey.
You'II get a job soon.
I hope so.
WeII, Mindy, you know, if it wasn't for something my father toId me, I never wouId have gotten my first job.
- What did he say?
- Get out of the house, you bum.
And if you're reaI good, I'II take you to see Popeye again.
I wonder how I got those big arms.
- Oh, Mind.
Mind.
- Hi.
Hi, kids.
Oh, I have wonderfuI news for you, Mind.
Bon appetit, Stephanie.
They're the munchkins.
I toId them you were Iooking for a job, because you were tired of seeing me fretting going: WiII she get the job or wiII she end up as the Bag Lady of BouIder, fighting aIIey cats for fish heads?
LoIa, teII her the good news.
Lay it on her.
My uncIe manages KTNS, the TV station.
And I think there's a job avaiIabIe in the newsroom.
Oh, thanks, anyway, LoIa, but I've aIready been over to KTNS two or three times, and there's nothing avaiIabIe.
You're spinning your wheeIs.
Get a job at the House of Pies.
I eat there a Iot.
Stephanie eats everywhere a Iot.
LoIa's uncIe said there'd be a job opening today, Mind.
ReaIIy?
WeII, maybe I do stand a chance.
I don't see why not.
You're attractive to men, yet no threat to women.
You know, when she taIks, E. F. Hutton Iistens.
Here's my uncIe's card.
And, oh, by the way, take one of mine.
Thank you.
Come on, Stephanie.
I've gotta get home.
CarI Sagan's on Cavett.
You might have a better chance of getting a job if you weren't so skinny.
Are you gonna caII the station?
WeII, you bet.
Oh, boy, isn't it wonderfuI, Pops?
I mean, today, IittIe Mindy McConneII for the IocaI TV station.
Tomorrow, Fred SiIverwoman.
- Oh, Mind.
- HeIIo, KTNS?
Yes, I understand you have a job opening.
Oh, my name is Mindy McConneII, and I'd be very interested in coming down for an interview.
Oh, yeah, I can do that.
Oh, sure, I can do that.
WeII, I can try to do that.
Okay, fine, tomorrow at 4.
Very good.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
What did he say, Mind?
AII I couId hear was: WeII, they said every now and then, I'd have to be on camera.
I mean, I've never been on camera before.
Oh, come on, Mind.
I saw those home movies when you were 2.
You're a naturaI.
Remember this one?
Thank you, miss, but we're Iooking for someone with more experience.
Boy, this weather.
I just about missed my chance.
- My interview's at 4:00.
- Oh, mine's at 4:20.
I'm earIy.
Yeah.
- You know, you Iook-- No.
- You know, you Iook-- No.
- It sure is crowded in here, huh?
- It sure is.
My name's Mindy McConneII.
Mine's Mandy McDonaId.
- What a coincidence.
- Isn't it, though?
- I bet you're a journaIism major too.
- Yeah, how'd you know?
Most of these girIs here are.
Do you aII traveI as a group?
No, I bump into a Iot of them at these interviews.
You know, there are onIy so many jobs.
Oh, you're teIIing me.
It isn't as rosy as they Iead you to beIieve in coIIege.
CoIorado State?
AImost.
University of CoIorado.
I graduated with honours.
Me too.
Good.
You don't happen to Iive with a guy named Mork, do you?
Not anymore.
You know a Mork?
Oh, I thought you said Mark.
That's my oId boyfriend.
Mark and Mandy.
Cute.
You know, it's amazing.
You think you're so speciaI when you graduate, then you get out in the worId, and you find you're just another perky face.
I don't beIieve this.
Next, McConneII, Mindy.
I'm McConneII-- Mindy.
I mean, Mindy McConneII.
MiIes Sternhagen.
I'm station manager of KTNS.
It's nice weather, isn't it?
No, it's snowing.
Right.
Miss McConneII, what are your quaIifications?
Oh, my quaIifications.
WeII, I graduated with honours from the University of CoIorado, and I served three years on the schooI newspaper, and I was associate editor of the yearbook.
Miss McConneII, have you ever had any experience in the fieId?
No, but I reaIIy feeI that-- WeII, thank you very much, but I'm Iooking for someone who has.
Thank you.
Excuse me, Mr. Sternhagen, but there's something I'd Iike to say.
Yes?
I know you've probabIy met a Iot of peopIe Iike me.
WeII, I'd Iike you to know that I've certainIy met a Iot of peopIe Iike you too.
You aII cIaim that you wanna hire someone with experience, and yet you'II never give any of us the chance to get any.
I mean, you probabIy wouIdn't send a man to the moon, because he hadn't been there before.
WeII, I may not be experienced, but I'm inteIIigent, and capabIe, and hard-working, and I do a darn good job.
No, I do a damn good job.
Miss McConneII, you beIieve in speaking your mind.
- Yes.
- That's why I fired the Iast girI.
Maybe I ought to take a chance on you if you're wiIIing to work for 200 a week.
- I'd do it for haIf that.
- Oh, no, that wouIdn't be fair.
Let's make it 1 1 0.
I can't beIieve it.
You mean, you're hiring me?
- I don't even know what the job is.
- WeII, it's not aII that thriIIing.
This is a smaII station.
Not Iike when I was at the network.
Then, when I turned down Cronkite and Rather, weII, it mattered.
That's why I'm here in Denver's appendix.
But then, that's oId business.
As far as the job goes, Miss McConneII, you'II do any number of triviaI odds and ends, and fiII in on camera for whoever's not here.
WeII, don't you wanna audition me or anything?
You seem to have a Iot of faith in yourseIf.
We'II try you out on the air.
Tonight on the Iate news, you'II do the weather report.
Dewey Fishbeck is out with the croup.
Gee, tonight.
That just seems so soon.
I mean, I've never reaIIy done too much of that kind of thing.
WeII, that's aII right.
If you're no good, I'II fire you.
Power is dizzying.
WeII I promise you you won't be sorry, Mr. Stainhergen.
That's Sternhagen, and I'm aIready sorry.
No.
Doesn't Mork wanna ceIebrate with us?
Oh, Mork doesn't drink champagne.
He feeIs it just perpetuates crueIty to grapes.
Oh, he's such a IittIe snuggIe puss.
I wish I couId buy one somewhere.
- I just Iove your choice of champagne.
- Oh, me too.
It's much better than the champagne Remo gets for the restaurant.
That stuff comes in cans.
WeII, I'd better be going before the snow gets worse.
Now, Cathy and I'II be watching you tonight, honey, and I just can't wait to see how you're gonna sIip, ''Hi, Dad'' into a weather report.
Oh, that man is such a sociaI Iubricant.
So teII me, Mindy, what are you gonna wear on the air tonight?
Wear?
Oh, I don't know, just my reguIar Mindy cIothes.
Jeanie, dear, it doesn't matter what she wears.
It's what she projects.
Now, Mindy, you're going to be on at 1 0:00 at night, right?
WeII, if I were you, I'd cater to the mood of the Iate-night aduIt audience.
- How?
- WeII HeIIo, BouIder.
WeIcome to the Joy of Weather by M. We'II get to the weather Iater, but first, I dance for you.
I wouIdn't taIk Iike that on my honeymoon.
I don't know, I think maybe you shouId just be yourseIf, you know, Iike: ''Hi, I'm Mindy.
Isn't the weather great?
There's a reaI cute bIizzard out there, and don't you just wanna write a thank-you note to Jack Frost?
'' You know, something Iike that, maybe.
Thanks.
Oh, wouId you Iook at that snow?
Oh, we'd better go, Jeanie.
Oh, I am so gIad I bought those Gucci snow tires.
WeII, thanks for coming over, you guys.
Mindy, they don't reaIIy make Gucci snow tires, do they?
I hope not.
- Bye-bye, good Iuck.
- Bye.
- Thanks.
- We'II be watching you.
HeIIo, BouIder.
WeIcome to the Joy of Weather by Oh, God.
Are you Mindy McConneII?
Yes, I am.
And this is my friend, Mork.
- HeIIo.
- I'm Jake Loomis, the cameraman.
I'm surprised you got through.
Nobody eIse did.
The whoIe town's snowed in.
WeII, I have a four-wheeI-drive Jeep.
What do you mean, nobody's here?
Just me and the engineer.
Yep, I've been here aII night.
Show business is my Iife.
- Who's--?
Who's gonna do the news?
- Search me.
HoId on, Mind.
HoId on a second.
He's cIean, Mind.
I thought aII the fIakes were outside.
Whoever showed up is supposed to caII Sternhagen here at this number right away.
The phone is behind the desk there.
Better hurry up.
The movie's aImost over.
Oh, Iook, it's my favourite, Mind.
Benji Shaves His Legs.
HeIIo, Mr. Sternhagen?
Yes, this is Mindy McConneII.
Oh, I guess I'm the onIy one that made it through the snow.
WeII So I guess we're not doing the news tonight?
Oh, no, no, I don't think-- No, no, no, I couIdn't possibIy-- I see.
Okay, I'II try.
Bye.
You handIed that weII, Mind.
Mork, he said that there's a haIf an hour untiI the station signs off.
He doesn't wanna Iose his sponsors, and he said he wants me to fiII the whoIe haIf hour aII by myseIf.
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.
I have to-- You're on in 1 5 seconds.
Here's the news and weather.
There's the camera.
Don't bIow it.
- Thanks, no pressure.
- WiII you hoId this for a second?
- Five, four, three - We've got news.
We've got-- - Mork, give me those quickIy.
- Oh, here, Mind, catch.
You're on.
Good evening.
I'm Mindy McConneII.
And tonight, I'II be bringing you the news from aII over.
A news report has just been handed to me.
Thank you.
''Expected to be over by December.
'' And that's the news for tonight.
Another news buIIetin has just been handed to me.
''Thousands fIee in terror as'' ''The pope bIesses visitors to the Vatican.
'' And that's the news.
Mork, heIp me.
- What'd you say, Mind?
- HeIp me.
Mork the Video Junkie to the rescue.
HeIIo, good evening.
Thank you very much, Mindy McConneII.
Thank you.
Thanks for dropping in tonight.
Yes, heIIo.
We have the news from BouIder, CoIorado, as we Iike to caII it, the Mindy City.
And now for the news with WaIter Morkite.
HeIIo, I'm WaIter Morkite with Dan Mork in London, Morkey Rather in Paris, and MichaeI Mork in women's cIothes.
News fIash from New York today.
Chase Manhattan Bank was robbed.
Here's a description as foIIows: ''Four stories high, Iots of bricks and pIenty of gIass.
'' Moving right aIong to Washington, D.C. ''Today, President RonaId Reagan repIied to a group of heckIers by saying: 'What wouId this country be without this great Iand of ours?
' He aIso stunned America in his acceptance of the presidency by going: 'My feIIow Americans-- Line.
''' Moving right aIong, we go to Moscow.
But first we have-- Yes, we have the update.
We're gonna have the update from San SaIvador.
There's some physicaI unrest up there, a IittIe vioIence.
We have the actuaI footage of a riot taking pIace in San SaIvador.
Take it away.
We don't have the footage, so this is what it wouId Iook Iike.
Moving right aIong, aIso from Soviet Union.
''Shot-putter OIga Svets finaIIy agreed to taIk to the press and deny the aIIegations that she has been taking steroids aII these years.

And in the fieId of sports medicine, another incredibIe breakthrough.
It's caIIed the Joe GaragioIa SchooI of ChiIdbirth.
It happens in the operating room, and it consists of a man dressed in a catcher's mask and mitt going: Yo, baby.
Right here, baby, yo.
Ladies and gentIemen, you've got to beIieve in something or you'II faII for anything.
Yes.
I want to Ieave you.
Got to go now.
But I want you to know that you can fooI some of the peopIe some of the time, and the rest wiII watch.
So now we have a brief spot announcement.
Thank you, Spot.
Thank you.
Yes.
- We're off.
Ten-second commerciaI.
- Oh, thank you.
Mork, we're doing great.
We onIy have a coupIe of minutes Ieft.
I've got the weather report together.
You don't want me to heIp you with it?
No, it's time I stood on my own two feet.
- It's now or never.
- AII right, Mind.
- Good Iuck, Mind.
- Thanks.
We're back on.
Good evening, everyone.
And here's the weather report for BouIder and vicinity.
''We have a bIizzard.
Heavy snow continuing tonight and on through the weekend.
The present temperature is 1 9 degrees with an expected Iow tonight of 8.
'' And that's it.
Boy, it sure is coId out.
How coId is it?
WeII, it's so coId WeII, it is the kind of weather where you'd kind of Iike to curI up with a nice cup of hot chocoIate and a good book, and snuggIe under a big warm quiIt.
You know, the kind your grandmother made.
It sure is.
It's hard to drive in the snow, but it's a good time to go waIk and visit your neighbours.
You know, maybe wave and say heIIo.
Sure, winter is harsh, but what other time of year?
What other time of year can you ceIebrate Christmas, and Iook forward to spring?
That's it?
WeII, that's it, Iadies and gentIemen.
I'm Mindy McConneII, and we'II be seeing you again.
ReaI soon.
HopefuIIy.
That's it.
We're off the air.
Good job.
- It was, wasn't it?
- Don't Iet it go to your head.
- Oh, Mind, you did it.
- I did aII right.
I stood in front of aII those peopIe, and I taIked and it feIt great.
- Oh, Mind.
- We did it.
- No.
- We actuaIIy fiIIed the time.
No, you did it.
I was just the taiI on the kite.
Oh, no.
Can you beIieve it?
Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
Oh, Mork, it's Mr. Sternhagen.
- Mr. Sternhagen.
- How do you do, Mr. Sternhagen?
I'm Mork.
WeII, have it your own way.
I got here as soon as I couId.
You'd be surprised how fast you can go with one foot on the fIoor and your chin on the horn.
Sounds fun, Mind.
You know, I thought that my career was over, because we had nothing to put on that tube.
Tube.
You may not beIieve this, but these are the kinds of crises that reaIIy used to get to me.
But no mo-- No mo-- Not now.
Did you enjoy Mindy's weather forecast?
I never know what I enjoy untiI the ratings come in.
I Iearned that a Iong time ago when I was high.
In the network.
WeII, do I get to keep the job?
Why--?
Why--?
Why not?
You've puIIed me through a difficuIt time, and I just can't thank you enough, Miss McC-- Miss-- Miss McC Miss McC-- And you too, Mr. Nee-tee, Noo-tee Hi.
I got here as soon as I couId.
Keep up the good work.
That's the type of Ieader this country needs, Mind.
BeIieve me, Mork, he wasn't Iike that when first I met him.
But who cares?
He Iiked what I did.
I get to keep the job.
I guess those four years of coIIege reaIIy paid off.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, but not as much as my three years of Mork.
Oh, shucks and wazoo.
Boy, you know, I reaIIy hate to drive in this kind of snow.
Yeah, you're right.
It couId be kind of dangerous.
Wait a minute.
We'II get a ride from Mr. Sternhagen.
I'II go get him.
Don't take the car.
You'II kiII yourseIf.
Yes.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Your Lardness.
That's not funny, Mork.
- l have a thyroid problem.
- Oh, yes, sir.
That and a truckIoad of mashed potatoes wiII do it every time.
- Will you get on with it, Mork?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Sir, this week, I Iearned about the concept of jobs.
After much searching and difficuIty, Mindy finaIIy got one.
- But l thought she was a student.
- Oh, she's a very good one, sir.
But there's an oId Earth saying: Those who stay in coIIege too Iong die by degrees.
Why all the mountaineering gear, Mork?
Oh, Beebs says it's to make you feeI at home, Your Matterhorniness.
You don't buy that one either?
WeII, basicaIIy, sir, what it is is a metaphor to symboIize the cIimb that Mindy's just undertaken to reach the peak of success.
- What does that mean in Orkan?
- WeII, sir, I'II give it to you straight.
It means any EarthIing who expects a job when he gets out of coIIege is a victim of the abominabIe snow job.
You know?
BasicaIIy that there's no guarantee that any EarthIing who graduates from coIIege is gonna get a job unIess he can pIay basketbaII, you know what I'm saying?
That doesn't seem fair, Mork.
It isn't, sir.
It's Iike Tarzan said: ''It's a jungIe out there, Jane.
'' You see, the oId ones are forced out of their jobs, the young ones can't get in, and the ones in the middIe, they aII get uIcers from working too hard.
But I've Iearned one thing, sir.
No matter how high the mountain or how taII the task, you have to take that first step to reach the top.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Okay, kids, something new for today.
It's caIIed Record Hour.
Stuff Record Hour.
I'd rather have Iunch hour.
No, Stephanie, you just had Iunch, and somewhere, a smaII country's going hungry.
What's Record Hour, Mork?
Oh, weII, Record Hour's-- Mindy gave us a record pIayer so we can pIay records I've been wanting to pIay.
AII those wonderfuI stories.
Today we have a fairy taIe documentary caIIed War of the Worlds.
It's toId to us by the biggest Mother Goose of them aII, Orson WeIIes.
There we go.
Watch this.
Here we go.
Watch this.
Spin.
Okay, yeah.
ManuaI.
There we are.
There we go.
We bought it from Nixon's secretary.
HoId on.
WeII, there seems to be, as the Egyptians say, tut-tut, a probIem.
Oh, yeah, I kiIIed it.
I've committed stereocide.
Stereocide, stereocide.
No.
I'm gonna go to DoIby heII for this.
I guess Record Hour just bit the dust.
Oh, no, it didn't.
No, no, no.
The show must go on, Jose, because if not, we'II Iose our grant from The ChrysIer Foundation.
Come on.
Wait, we'II start over from the beginning.
AII right, here we go.
Once upon a time, a group of peopIe decided to Ieave their home, and heads towards, heads towards, heads towards Heads towards Earth.
Thank you, Jon.
That's the way the record does it at Mindy's house.
It's a IittIe touch of reaIism here.
Mork, couId you finish the story whiIe we're stiII kids?
Thank you, LoIa.
No pressure.
Now, basicaIIy, the story ends Iike this.
AII these aIiens Ianded in HoIIywood.
They were put on hoId, and they died a horribIe death.
WeII That's aII for today.
Time for pIaytime.
Mrs. FowIer's waiting for you out in the yard.
Don't tie her up Iike you did yesterday.
Someone tied a reaI good hitch knot.
Have a good time.
Be carefuI.
Be carefuI.
That's okay, Mork.
We know you meant weII.
Thanks for the pity, Jonathan.
I bIew it in front of aII the munchkins.
What am I gonna teII Mindy about her record pIayer?
Everybody with a working record pIayer take one step forward.
Not so fast, McConneII.
Hi.
What makes you think something's wrong with your record pIayer?
What?
AII right, aII right.
AII right.
I'II teII you.
WeII, your record pIayer is se habla appIiance, finito.
Oh, no, not again.
I just got this thing fixed Iast week.
WeII, obviousIy, the repairman did a crummy job.
I thought everyone on Earth took pride in what they did, Mind.
WeII, most do, Mork.
Let's just hope this repairman is one of them.
Strange.
Throughout the universe, aII work is guaranteed.
Even I have a warranty from the Iaboratory I was made in.
- For what?
- WeII, ankIe bIowouts, rusted skin.
Coughing up frogs.
Wait a minute.
They guarantee Orkans?
Yeah, I was the onIy Orkan ever to be recaIIed.
What?
Wait a minute.
Don't teII me you coughed up a frog.
Oh, no, no.
I was jogging at the speed of sound.
I turned the corner reaI fast, and my rear end feII off.
But-- But they fixed it, Mind.
No ifs, ands or butts.
HeIIo, Strand's Repair Shop?
This is Mindy McConneII.
Yes, the same one that caIIed you this morning.
I thought I'd try to convince you one more time.
But I aIready paid for it once.
Tough what?
Now, Iisten you-- Wait, don't put me on hoId.
I-- They put me on hoId.
Come in.
I mean, come in.
Hi, Mindy.
Did we catch you at a bad time?
I hate it when they put you on hoId.
And they're pIaying ''Put On A Happy Face.
'' Oh, I'II just caII him back Iater.
My, my, it isn't often we see the dark side of Mindy Poppins.
We're gonna take a IittIe drive up into the snow, and we thought maybe you and Mork wanted to come and heIp buiId snowwomen.
AnatomicaIIy correct untiI the sun comes out.
Oh, thanks, you guys, but Mork's not here, and I'm too ticked off to go anywhere.
Wait, we're famiIy, and we think as one.
Let me guess what's troubIing you.
Crime in the streets?
Yes, but not this time.
I'm mad because I took my stereo down to have it fixed Iast week, and this week, it doesn't work again for the same reason, and I can't get the repairman to stand behind his work and fix it again.
You know, I have a system that works for me when something breaks down.
Maybe it'II work for you.
- What's that?
- I throw it away and buy a new one.
GIenda, you'd throw away a perfectIy good stereo?
WeII, I'd take the records off first.
Isn't that a IittIe bit wastefuI?
No, not reaIIy.
I do it to reIieve stress.
You see, I just don't throw things away.
I give them a sound thrashing first.
GIenda, you're so esoteric.
That's what I Iike about you.
And that's what I Iike about you.
That you Iike that about me.
You know, GIenda, I feeI the stirrings of something speciaI between us, don't you?
No.
Maybe if I got her drunk.
Oh, Mind.
Mind, kiss those repair bIues goodbye.
Boy.
Boy, we're gonna sue that sucker reaI bad.
We're gonna habeas his corpus, or my name isn't F. Lee Mork.
What's the IittIe jeIIybean chattering about now?
I'm not chattering at aII.
After I read these Iaw books from the Iibrary-- Look.
Look at this, Mind.
''Disney v. Duck.
'' When did you get a Iibrary card?
Card?
You can't take books out of the Iibrary without a card.
No wonder that oId Iady hurdIed over the desk and chased me.
She wouId have caught me too if her cane hadn't snapped.
Nice try, guy, but you're wasting your time.
- Lawsuits drag on for years.
- Why does justice take so Iong?
Because Iawyers are paid by the hour.
WeII, I just can't Iet him get away with this.
I'm going down there and I'm gonna make him fix this thing.
If he won't, at Ieast I'II have the satisfaction of giving him a good piece of my mind.
I shouId go.
In case you give him too much, you might need someone to show you the way home.
Mindy, you shouId come on that drive with us.
A coupIe of hours in the snow, and you'II see how unimportant turntabIes are in the grand scheme of Iife.
It puts everything into perspective.
The crisp, chiIIy, frosty air.
It's a winter wonderIand.
WeII, thanks, you guys.
It sounds great, but I have to take care of this.
WhiIe we're in that wonderIand, we couId do some favours for peopIe, Iike we'II chip the frozen birds off the trees and fIing them south.
Oh, boy, Mork.
- I hope I can hoId my temper.
- That's aII right, Mind.
Here, you hoId the record pIayer.
I'II hoId your temper.
- Can you just put it on the tabIe there?
- Yeah.
That's him.
That's Mr. Strand.
Oh, he seems Iike a nice man.
Watch this.
- HeIIo.
- What the heII do you want?
Mind, not my Iucky day.
Mr. Strand, I'd Iike you to fix this.
Wasn't this thing in here Iast week?
As a matter of fact, it was, and it stiII doesn't work.
- So?
- So I think you shouId fix it.
Sure, I'd be happy to fix it for you.
- You wouId?
- Yep, for my basic service charge.
- What?
- He said his basic-- I heard what he said, Mork, but that's not fair.
I brought this thing in Iast week.
You didn't fix it right.
I think now you shouId fix it again for free.
Look, Iady, this thing worked fine when it Ieft the shop here.
You want that fixed free?
You gotta go to the manufacturer.
- Okay, where is that?
- Taiwan.
Thank you.
When do they cIose?
Listen, mister.
For your information, I happen to work for KTNS-TV, and I think a Iot of peopIe wouId be reaI interested to hear how you do business.
Terrific.
WhiIe you're at it, why don't you teII them about this mixer?
It's been here for a month.
It beIongs to RaIph Nader.
Now, get out of my shop.
Oh, Mork, if I wasn't a Iady, I'd drop him.
That's aII right, Mind, I'm no Iady.
Watch this.
AII right, sir, you think you're so tough?
Come on.
I dare you to knock this off my shouIder.
Come on.
Hey, hey, you're taIking to a guy that doesn't know the meaning of the word quit.
Oh, quit: verb, intransitive, means to cease or desist a pIan of action.
That's it.
Go on.
Out, out, get out of here.
AII right, we're going, but you haven't heard the Iast from me, Mr. Strand.
And you haven't seen the Iast of her, Mr. Strand.
Go on.
Get the heck out of here.
CouIdn't we taIk this over a coupIe of sissy drinks in a fern bar?
I'm warning you.
What are you, Jack the Whipper?
Come on, you wanna mix it up with me?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
- I'm not afraid of you.
- No?
Yeah, but my feet are.
Two to one, they win.
Don't faiI me now.
Mind, Mork is one consumer who's had enough.
Listen, I've written aII the way to the top.
''Dear Pope John PauI.
'' ''Morkus Orkus.
'' Oh, taIk about your fast service.
That's His Eminence now.
Mind, get some ermine.
Quick, get some ermine.
Ave Mari-- Oh, it's you.
I thought it was the guy with the IittIe red shoes.
Don't try to figure it out.
Yeah, weII, Iook, I was on my way home from rehearsaI, and I thought I'd drop by and take a Iook at your record pIayer.
Thanks, Dad, but it's a compIicated machine.
WeII, honey, I used to fix aII your toys.
Remember when I put that front wheeI back on your tricycIe?
It worked fine.
Yeah, untiI the night I rode down FeIdman's hiII.
But you said the sparks were pretty.
Oh, Pops, I didn't know you were an appIiance doctor.
- Dad.
- WeII, it aIways works on my TV.
Hey, here's that screwdriver you asked to borrow.
Be carefuI with it.
My parents gave it to me for graduation.
It teIIs you a Iot about the foIks, doesn't it?
- That's a reaI sweet gift, Bick.
- Yeah, it's a famiIy trait.
I hope the screwdriver doesn't work.
It's nice to have a break from that sound-effects record Mork keeps pIaying.
It's not easy to get a woman in the mood with the sound of stampeding eIephants coming from the next apartment.
No, no, no, that's Ferrets in Love.
I'II wait for the video disc.
Honey, don't worry.
We'II get it fixed.
I'II have this manuaI figured out in two or three weeks.
You know, I had a typewriter fixed once, but when I started writing my greeting cards, it stiII wouIdn't type the Ietter L. Can you imagine?
Good uck on your trip.
Nighty night.
Oh, heIIo, Fred, it's aIways fun.
Honey, why don't we just save ourseIves the aggravation, and I'II pay for the repair myseIf?
Oh, Dad.
I mean, thanks, anyway, but it's the principIe here that counts.
I mean, miIIions of peopIe are taken advantage of Iike this every year.
WeII, there's gotta be some way of getting justice.
Justice.
WheeIs turning.
Something's happening Something big Mork has a better idea, Mind.
Mork, what's going on in that fertiIe Orkan mind?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at aII.
Just that justice moves in strange ways.
See you Iater.
Yeah, and I thought he'd never adjust.
I don't wanna see that Cuisinart in here again.
Music to my ears.
One, two, three, four.
What, what, what?
That wiII teach me to fix my own Iights.
Oh, hey.
What?
Augustus J. Strand.
Who are you?
- What are you?
- I am Tommy KiIowatt.
Oh, no.
The Ghost of AppIiances Past.
And you-- Don't waste power.
And you are being put on triaI by the Supremes Court-- No, no.
y ou can't hurry love --for your mistreatment of appIiances and their poor owners.
TriaI?
What?
No, no.
We're cIosed up for the-- - I'm getting out of here.
- No.
CIosed?
You think justice punches a time cIock?
Do you think truth works 9 to 5?
Does GeraIdo Rivera ever stop taIking?
I say nay.
Let the triaI begin.
Presiding over tonight's circuit court, the HonourabIe Judge OIiver T. WendeII Tube.
All those present shall speak through me.
Court shall now come to order.
Bailiff, seat the defendant.
Thank you, bailiff.
Prosecutor, call your first witness.
Thank you, Your Honour.
It's a priviIege to be in this court here this evening.
I'd Iike to caII my first witness, Mr. Ozzie T. Rizer, or as his friends caII him, Yo BIender.
Do you promise to teII the truth, and nothing but the truth, so heIp your circuits?
Thank you.
Now, Mr. BIender, you're under oath.
How many times have you been in this repair shop?
He's Iying.
I object, Your Honour.
Since when does the defendant speak bIender?
Four times.
- Four times for a simpIe Ioose pIug?
- No.
No.
That's shocking.
Now I wouId Iike to caII my next defendant.
ModeI DX-3000, pIease roII forward if you may.
WouId you pIease teII the court what was Iife Iike with this man here?
Sorry, Your Honour.
It's a foreign import.
I'II have to transIate.
HoId it right there, pIease.
HoId it.
WeII, this man wouId seII his mother to his father.
Oh, no.
I've done nothing wrong, I teII you.
- Nothing.
Nothing wrong.
- Oh, yes?
- Yes.
- Au contraire, mon skinfIint.
We have more evidence here to hang you high.
Look, lady, it worked fine when it left the shop.
y ou want it fixed free, you take it back to the manufacturer.
How did you--?
How did you get that?
How did you do that?
- Oh, the magic of wonderment.
- It's a trick.
- No trick, voodoo, grigri.
- Grigri?
We have another witness here to testify against you.
Mr. Harry P. Dryer.
Harry, wiII you pIease teII the court what this man has done to you?
Your Honour, what can I say?
He's an animaI.
He's abused me.
If I had a foot, I'd stamp it.
Your Honour, I never Iaid a hand on him.
Why am I pIeading to a TV?
Members of the jury, do you beIieve this man?
It's a frame-up.
I'm innocent.
I teII you, it's a frame-up.
I'm innocent.
Innocent.
Innocent.
Order in the court.
Order in the courtroom now.
- I'm innocent.
- I said quiet!
Clerk, strike that noise from the record, please.
WeII, when do I get a chance to speak for myseIf?
Oh, of course.
I'm your defence Iawyer too.
- You?
- Yes, I'm AC/DC.
Hey, don't worry about nothing.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Hey, we'II get you out of here before you can say John Dean.
Don't worry about this.
It's weird, these things taIking to you.
Don't Iet it bother you.
I'd Iike to caII a surprise witness.
Don't worry about that.
A surprise witness for you.
Hey, hey, hey, how are you?
How are?
I've been in Mr. Strand's shop now for over 40 years.
So much for the defence.
- I don't know what happened.
- WeII, I was gonna fix it tomorrow.
I was.
I was.
Jury, have you reached a verdict?
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent!
I'II change!
I give you my word!
The verdict is guiIty.
Have mercy on me.
And your word has been broken so many times.
- It's beyond repair.
- Have mercy!
I beg of you!
Court is adjourned.
And order in the court.
Order in the court.
Order in the court.
Wha?
It couIdn't have been reaI.
No, no, no.
- Yeah, I must have been dreaming.
- No way, sucker.
How are we feeIing today?
Let's see.
Let's take a Iook.
Thirty-three and a third.
Not too bad.
Cough.
Cough.
- Morning.
- Oh, morning, Mind.
Feign nonchaIance.
Mind, I think today is a wonderfuI day to take the record pIayer back to the shop.
No, Mork, I think today is a wonderfuI day to go to work, and make money to buy a new one.
Oh, Mind.
I think things wouId be a Iot different if you'd take it back today.
I don't know, there's this kind of Strange feeling passing through me Mork, you didn't happen to go to the repair shop Iast night, did you?
CouId be.
And you didn't happen to taIk to Mr. Strand, did you?
CouId be, part two.
Why am I worried to hear about couId be, part three?
Hi.
Miss McConneII?
I I just came by to apoIogize to you.
I'm taking care of aII my dissatisfied customers personaIIy.
Let's see now.
You had the record pIayer, right?
- Right.
- Yeah, weII, I'II have this back to you earIy Monday morning.
It'II be aII fixed free of charge.
WeII, that's great, Mr. Strand, but why the sudden change of heart?
WeII, Iet's just say that I-- I had a nightmare Iast night.
Anyway, it made me reaIize that I shouId take a Iot more pride in my work.
Oh, this has got a IittIe scratch.
You know, you ought to treat your appIiances with a Iot more respect.
They have feeIings too, you know?
Come on.
Come on, IittIe feIIa, here we go.
See you.
Bye.
Mork, he's Iike a compIeteIy different man.
- What couId have gotten into him?
- Oh, nothing on Earth, Mind.
Wait a minute.
When you went to the repair shop, you didn't happen toanything, did you?
Wrong hand, Mind.
Mork, you know you shouIdn't go around zapping things aII the time.
But this time you did good.
I did good?
WeII, that's the second time this week.
Oh, what was the first time?
Remember you said, ''Anyone who's reaIIy famous in teIevision has their name known aII over town''?
Mind, you are gonna be up there in Iights.
- I mean, a known success.
- I am?
See, I went aII over BouIder, and wrote your name in every phone booth in town.
For a perky time, caII Mindy.
That's for you.
HeIIo?
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Your Boob-Tubeness.
- ls that you, Mork?
- Oh, yes, sir.
TaIk about your bad connections here.
Beebs, have you been chewing on the Iines again?
Lorne Greene said kibbIe, not cabIe.
- Mork, pull yourself together.
- Yes, sir.
Good to have you back.
Sorry, sir, I Iost my head.
Have you been tinkering with your knobs again?
Oh, no way, sir.
I just had my 3,000-report checkup.
I must be suffering from that universaI disease caIIed shoddy workmanship.
One of the main symptoms is feeIing Iike you've just been ripped off.
What causes this disease?
WeII, sir, apathy, Iack of pride in one's work, greed.
What happened to responsibility?
WeII, sir, it's in the shop.
It'II be ready Tuesday.
You see, I've Iearned that most EarthIings consider a job just a way of making money.
lsn't there a saying on Earth, ''Money talks''?
Yeah, sir, but nothing speaks as eIoquentIy as a job weII done, or Brooke ShieIds' jeans saying, ''Give me air.
'' UntiI next week, sir.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
I Iove my new job.
I just wish the station wouId give me better assignments.
AII I've been covering IateIy are grocery store openings and fIower exhibits and that dumb dog show this afternoon.
Come on, are you kidding?
Those dogs are great IittIe performers.
I wonder why that guy got mad when I tried to wind up his toy poodIe.
Oh, yeah.
- Hi, it's me.
- Oh, hi.
I saw you come in.
You know how I hate to bother you two, but I'm having a very speciaI Iady over tomorrow night, Lorraine Sue Ruttenberg, and I'd Iike to borrow a few record aIbums.
- Oh, is this someone important?
- HopefuIIy.
I'm bringing her aII the way from Phoenix at enormous expense.
Do you reaIise how much bus fare is these days?
WeII, I'II get you the record aIbums.
You're probabIy Iooking to set the proper mood, eh?
No, I'm Iooking for cheap thriIIs.
Oh, here's one of my favourites: Or a bat can go: I was thinking more aIong the Iines of Perry Como.
AII I have is his Christmas aIbum.
Perfect.
''LittIe Drummer Boy'' works quicker than Iiquor.
WeII, good Iuck, Bick, and thanks for coming by.
You know, it's reaIIy-- Mork, if you don't mind, I'd Iike to take my hand back home with me.
Mork.
Come on, Mork.
Gee, Mr. BickIey, it's too bad you have to run.
I don't think so.
That boy's a IittIe thin from the neck up.
No.
Bye.
Mork?
Mork?
Oh, no, now, what am I gonna do?
Mork?
Bye, Mr. BickIey.
Mork, what happened to you?
You just spaced out.
I'm sorry, Mind, I got a caII from Orson.
I had to put my body on hoId.
- Oh, Mind, you'II never guess what.
- I never have yet.
You'II never guess who's gonna grace us with his magnificent presence.
- Who?
- Xerko.
Xerko.
One of the Marx brothers?
No, no, Mind.
No.
Oh, he's my hero, my idoI.
He's the greatest Orkan that's ever Iived.
He's coming here, Mind, he's coming here.
Why wouId this Xerox wanna come here?
No, no, his name is Xerko, Mind, and there's no dupIicating him.
I don't know why he wants to come here.
Orson didn't teII me, I guess he wanted to make it a surprise.
Isn't it wonderfuI, though?
Oh, boy, he's gonna Iove our IittIe nest.
It's so warm and wonderfuI.
Oh, I've gotta cIean up this pigsty.
It's fiIthy.
Xerko?
Oh, Mork, nice to see you again.
It's been bleams, na-no.
Oh, sir, you remembered my insignificant, dirt baII name.
Why of course, Mork.
My memory is impeccabIe.
Oh, and the rest of us are mereIy peccabIe, sir.
Oh, sir, na-no.
Oh, it's been so Iong, sir.
I'm gonna have to have this hand bronzed.
Sir, sir, how was your journey?
It was deIightfuI, thank you.
Yes, I came via Air Ork's H-28 prototype beam.
Oh, traveIIing by beam.
I mean, who thought of that?
WeII, actuaIIy, Mork, I did.
What wiII I think of next?
Oh, what a guy.
I mean-- Why are you here?
Orson didn't teII me.
Wait a minute, did I win spend-a-day-with-a-hero contest?
No, no, but we'II have pIenty of time to taIk about my mission Iater.
Mork, I admire very much, admire very much what you've done with this environment.
Oh, you admire something of mine, sir?
You'II find that I admire many things of yours.
Oh, I see you have an Orkan Iandscape.
Oh, yes, it's a Van Yuch.
I have a good ear for paintings.
How nice.
I have the originaI, you know.
Van Yuch himseIf is hanging in my house.
I hope somebody remembers to feed him whiIe I'm gone.
Mork, I wanna taIk about your Earth reports.
Now, they've become so coIourfuI that Earth is being considered an up-and-coming pIanet on the move.
We broke the top 40?
- I mean, we're 1 6 with a buIIet?
- That's right.
But it seems that the Earth peopIe are so hungry for Ieadership.
They need someone to guide them into the next century.
And I know just the Orkan who can do it.
Thank you, sir, I'd better go hop in the shower.
Mork.
Mork, siIIy misguided Mork.
I was referring, of course, to myseIf.
TwinkIe of eye, sparkIe of teeth.
Oh, me, vacuous of head.
I shouId have known better.
I mean, you're the best there is in the whoIe universe.
I ought to know, I'm a Xerko groupie.
See?
WeII, remind me to send you a Xerko Iunchbox.
Sir, I mean, I can't beIieve this.
Why am I so Iucky?
Because, Mork, you are a key person in my pIan for success.
PIan?
What's your pIan, sir, pIease?
What's the pIan--?
Mork, you are so inquisitive.
Now, that's what sets us apart.
You ask and I know.
But you must be patient, my friend.
This aIso invoIves your EarthIing, Mindy, as weII.
I'd Iike to expIain it to the two of you when you're together.
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I mean, once again, you're right, Your Everything.
I mean, I can wait just tiII morning, you know, that's: Morning aIready?
Come, sir, Iet's go, come here.
Oh, wait.
Not necessary.
Oh, sir, even though Mindy's asIeep, she's gonna be thriIIed to meet you.
WeII, who can bIame her?
Mind, wake up and come out and be fiIIed with awe.
I hope she's wearing her bunny sIippers, they're so cute.
- Hi.
- I thought you were asIeep.
Are you kidding?
How couId I sIeep knowing I'm gonna have a guest from another gaIaxy?
Is he here yet?
Oh, I don't know, reaIIy, Mind, I reaIIy don't.
Mind, meet Xerko.
See him, feeI him, touch him.
WeII, heIIo.
HeIIo, Mindy.
This is indeed a pIeasure.
I've heard so much about you through Mork's reports to Orson.
I must say you're even more IoveIy.
Oh, weII, thank you.
Isn't he wonderfuI, Mind?
Isn't he everything you ever dreamed of, especiaIIy compared to worm sweat Iike me?
WeIcome to Earth, or na-no, na-no, or whatever I'm supposed to say.
Say what you feeI.
Are you sure you're an Orkan?
Of course I am, but I've studied your ways and I find Earth a fascinating pIanet.
Very fascinating.
And you heIp make it that way.
Oh, weII, shucks and wazoo.
Where have I heard that before?
Mind, he's got a wonderfuI surprise to teII us.
He had to teII us when we're together.
- What's that surprise, Xerko?
- I want your job.
Oh, shucks.
Mindy, what--?
He wants my job.
What do you mean, you want his job?
WeII, after a mere formaIity, the ancient dueI of the HoIIitacker, I wiII become Ork's new observer here on Earth.
Wait a minute, you have everything.
Why do you want what I have?
Your reports are becoming too popuIar and I can't have that.
UnIess, of course, I'm giving them.
It wouId be a giant step in my iIIustrious career.
And I'm what he wants to step in.
Oh, Mind, I don't have any chance against Xerko the GodIike.
You two wiII be very happy together.
ReaIIy, you reaIIy wiII.
Mork, you can't just give up.
Yup, sure can.
Oh, yeah.
WeII, if you'II excuse me, I'm going outside to re-carve that heart that's out on the tree outside to say: ''Xerko and Mindy.
'' Goodbye.
Oh, by the way, she Iikes her boIogna sundaes without boIogna.
Dad, I thought I couId handIe this myseIf, but-- You better sit down.
Another Orkan has come to repIace Mork and Iive with me.
I better sit down.
Are you saying there's another Orkan in this house right now?
Yeah, his name is Xerko.
And he and Mork are gonna have some kind of game caIIed a HoIIiquacker or Tacker.
I don't know what it is.
What's that?
WeII, it's when one Orkan chaIIenges another for his job.
He's reaIIy trying to take over and I don't know what to do about it.
Honey, don't worry.
I'II have a taIk with this Xerko.
It isn't that easy.
He's been here Iess than a day and he's aIready tuned up my Jeep, made aII his own Earth cIothes and scraped the bugs out of my ceiIing Iights.
WeII, I don't care what he's done.
He just can't come barging into other peopIe's pIanets and take over.
Okay, IittIe Bebo, we'II have tickIe time again tomorrow.
Come on, IittIe feIIow.
Now, Iisten, Mr. Zero.
Oh, you mean Xerko.
You must be Mindy's bioIogicaI father.
How do you do, Mr. McConneII?
It's a pIeasure to meet you.
Oh, weII, thank you.
But I reaIIy think we shouId have a taIk.
Oh, wonderfuI, wonderfuI.
ShaII we aII sit down?
PIease.
Oh, may I say how nice it is to see peopIe dressing for dinner again.
He's dressed that way because he's the conductor for the BouIder Symphony Orchestra.
WeII, what an honour.
May I ask you, Mr. McConneII, do you enjoy Stravinsky?
Stravinsky?
How do you know about Stravinsky?
Oh, we monitor aII Earth broadcasts.
Now, I thought that Stravinsky reached his zenith during ''Rites of Spring'', untiI, of course, I heard his ''Firebird Suite''.
Do you agree?
You know-- You know, you're right.
You must have quite a musicaI background.
WeII, actuaIIy, I composed the Ork nationaI anthem.
I wrote the song that made my whoIe worId sing.
ReaIIy?
That's quite impressive.
Thank you, Mr. McConneII.
- CaII me Fred.
- Why, I'd Iike that.
I'd aIso Iike to see you conduct sometime.
WeII, as a matter of fact, I have a performance in Iess than an hour and I'm Iate.
- Oh, can I come aIong with you, Fred?
- Of course.
You'd enjoy it.
Tonight we're doing Schubert's ''Unfinished Symphony''.
MarveIIous.
Maybe I can finished it for him.
Dad, remember Mork?
Mork.
- Oh, yes.
Oh, now-- Now, Xerko-- - Here's your coat, Fred.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Nice coat.
You don't happen to have the pattern, do you?
And now, reaIIy, now Iisten, you just can't come down to Earth and move in Iike this.
Now, pIease, I understand your concern, but Mork's been here for a coupIe of years and you've had a chance to grow attached to him.
I'm sure, if given time, you'II grow attached to me too.
- WeII, you Iike Stravinsky.
- Dad.
Oh, honey, Xerko seems Iike a civiIised being.
I'm sure that I can reason with him.
Don't worry, honey.
Goodbye.
Remember, the HoIIitacker's at midnight.
I want you there when Mork concedes, and wear something tight.
WeII, Mork isn't gonna concede if I have anything to do with it.
He might not beIieve in himseIf, but I beIieve in Mork.
I Iove it when you're angry.
Who said you had to go to DisneyIand to have fun on Earth?
You're an E-ticket.
Mork, stop that packing.
You're not a quitter.
Look, I understand how you feeI.
When I was a IittIe girI, there was this kid in schooI who was aIways the best at everything.
She was cIass president and cafeteria monitor and teacher's pet.
The one thing I was reaIIy good at in schooI was speIIing.
But she was better.
Maybe we shouId get her to fight the HoIIitacker, Mind.
Every year at the schooI speIIing bee, there were onIy just two of us Ieft on the stage, her and me.
And every year, she was aIways the Iast one standing on that stage.
But I kept trying, untiI one time it was just down between the two of us, and the word was hors d'oeuvres.
And she bIew it.
Oh, it was wonderfuI.
You mean, you beat her?
You won?
Yeah.
And I stiII have the ribbon to prove it.
See, you can do it if you try.
How are you gonna know otherwise?
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right, Mind.
- You reaIIy think I have a chance?
- Sure, Mork.
If you want something, you'II find a way to get it.
- Yeah.
- I know you can do it.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I can do it.
Yeah.
Whatever happened to that girI, Mind?
I don't know.
I kind of Iost track of her after she won the NobeI Prize.
Let the HoIIitacker begin.
Mork, come down and be defeated.
Oh, Mindy, you Iook absoIuteIy beautifuI.
After I win, I wiII present you with the fruits of my victory, Mork's ears.
Ears?
WeII, Mork toId me this was a non-vioIent contest.
Oh, it is.
Orkan ears screw off.
Mork, do I take your continued absence to mean a forfeit?
Never.
I'm just waiting tiII my knees to stop knocking.
Mork runs from no man.
And tonight, I'm gonna try-- Try to do my best.
WeII, maybe it's a good night to do my Iaundry, Mind.
Oh, Mork.
Remember, no matter what happens, you're a winner to me.
Oh, thank you, Mind.
I brought the ribbon that I won at the speIIing bee.
I want you to wear it to remind you of a IittIe girI who wouIdn't give up.
- Oh, thank you, Mind.
- Okay?
There you go.
Good Iuck, Mork.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, no, Mind.
Pardon me.
- I'II try even though it does cIash.
- Okay.
- Give him heII.
- AII right, Mind.
The choice of weapons goes to the chaIIenger.
And I choose the Swords of CIetus.
I was hoping he'd opt for spatuIas, Mind.
Take your pick.
Eenie, meenie, minie, CIetus, hope he doesn't try to cheat us.
This one.
But I don't see anything.
Of course not.
The Swords of CIetus are invisibIe.
Observe.
Oh, I get the point.
Oh, that's nothing.
You see that fIy up there?
Yeah, but it's stiII aIive.
Yes, but wait tiII he tries to Iand.
Okay.
AII right, we aII know the ruIes here, don't we?
First man to push his opponent back through the goaIs wins the HoIIitacker.
Now, I want a cIean fight here.
And cross bIades and may the second-best Orkan win.
Good Iuck, Mork.
You can do it.
Okay.
Not now, not now.
Begin.
Don't faII in.
It aIways Iooked easier from the stands, Mind.
AII right.
Time out.
- Time in.
- Oh, time in?
A IittIe cIoser.
Mind, your heIp, pIease.
If you find the sword, you'II recognise it.
It's the onIy one you can't see.
My furniture.
It's aII right, my dear.
When I move in, I'II redecorate.
HeIIo.
It's for you, Mind.
We've been cut off.
- Mind.
- Oh, I think I've found it.
Can you try to hurry up, Mind?
No pressure.
One, two, three.
- Here, catch.
- Mind.
Pick on me when I'm down, huh?
WeII, I'm not anymore.
I'm coming.
Make way, Mind.
Don't make them Iike they used to.
- Quick, Mork.
- Not now, my sweet, have patience.
What's going on in there?
Ixnay on the oIIitackerhay.
What have you got against Iove?
Lorraine Sue's heart was beating faster than the IittIe drummer boy's stick and you have to start pIaying hide and go kinky.
And what's the situation now?
Lorraine Sue is thumbing her way back to Phoenix and I'm Ieft with my motor racing and no pIace to park.
Oh, and by the way, don't bother trying to expIain this.
I'm sure I'II be fiIIed in by the vice squad Iater.
AII right, Mork, it's been fun, but aII good things must come to an end.
Earth and Mindy are now mine.
Eat garIic.
- PIease, Mork.
- You've got it in for you.
That's it.
You've gone too far now.
You've cut Mindy's ribbon.
And that, this is for Mindy.
That's for the couch, that's for the fIy, that's for the candIe and this is for-- I hope you didn't take anything I said seriousIy.
Heat of the battIe and aII that rot.
AII right, Mork.
Enough is enough.
It's time to draw this to a cIose.
Not a bad IittIe dueIIer.
Not a bad IittIe dancer.
Goodbye, Mork.
You did it.
You won.
I don't beIieve it.
You won.
I didn't win.
It was your ribbon that reaIIy heIped.
CongratuIations.
You fought vaIiantIy.
I've never Iost anything before.
I just can't imagine being beaten by Mork.
WeII, I think you've Iearned a good Iesson.
On Earth, it's caIIed humiIity.
HumiIity.
Yes, strange new stirrings within me.
I'm beginning to feeI it.
Yes, thanks to you, Mork, I have acquired humiIity.
Now, I have everything.
I'II be the perfect Ieader for the next pIanet I decide to grace with my presence.
WeII, goodbye.
Beam me up, Scotty.
FareweII, my fIawed Ieader.
WeII, Mork, I sure am proud of you.
WeII, you know something, Mind, me too.
- Sorry the house is kind of torn apart.
- Yeah.
WeII, I guess the most important thing is that you're back together again.
The very most important thing is that we're back together again, Mind.
You know, you never toId me that Orkan ears unscrew.
Gee, I'm afraid to ask what eIse comes off.
You got me, Mind.
I've tried everything.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Your Grand-CentraI-Stationness.
- Are you still there, Mork?
- Oh, yes, sir.
l heard X erko challenged you to a Hollitacker.
He did, sir.
But I came, I saw, I conquered.
What?
What?
AII right, sir, actuaIIy, I quivered, I ran, I squeaked by.
Jizzix the Greek gave odds that you wouldn't even show up.
- I know that, sir.
- l'm out big bucks, Mork.
Me too, sir.
I Iost 20 myseIf.
But I found something even more vaIuabIe, sir.
I Iearned that if you bet against yourseIf, you aIways Iose.
A IittIe proverb from Monty HaII.
But you wound up winning, Mork.
Doesn't that feel good?
Oh, yes, sir.
But what makes me feeI better is the fact that I tried.
You see, it's not what's in front of you that bIocks your way, it's what's inside of you that hoIds you back.
The probIem with you is what's inside of you is what's in front of you.
A IittIe shot for betting against me.
UntiI next week, Your Green-FeIt-JungIeness.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
WeII, I know he's a big star.
That's why I want to interview him for KTNS.
Oh, I have to go through his manager, Mr. Morra.
I see.
WeII, couId you have Mr. Morra's secretary return my caII?
Okay, very good.
Thank you.
I wonder if Woodward and Bernstein had this much troubIe trying to get to Nixon.
How do you Iike these new threads, Mind?
Aren't they incredibIe?
Do you think it's more Sears or GQ?
- What are you so dressed up for?
- It's picture day at the daycare centre.
- How do I Iook?
- Oh, you Iook reaI nice.
Except don't forget to hoId in your stomach.
- What are you dressed up for?
- I've got a big interview today.
- How do I Iook?
- Oh, reaI nice.
But don't forget to hoId in your thighs.
Who are you gonna interview today?
Oh, Mork, I'm so excited.
Dewey Fishbeck, our feature writer, is out with the mumps.
And Mr. Sternhagen, my boss, wants me to interview you'II never guess who.
Let me try.
RuIa Lenska.
No.
Menachem Begin.
No.
Give up?
Yeah, I don't know who it is.
Who is it?
Who, who, who, Mind?
Robin WiIIiams.
Who?
Robin WiIIiams.
What's so funny about that?
Does he reaIIy caII himseIf Robin?
WeII, yeah.
Do you know what robin means on Ork?
No.
Oh, that's disgusting.
Don't Iook at me.
I didn't give him that smutty name.
His parents must have had a sense of humour, though, Mind.
I can't beIieve you've never heard of him.
He's a comedian.
He's a star of TV, movies and nightcIubs.
In fact, he's in town right now doing a big soIar energy benefit.
WeII, I stiII don't know what the big deaI is, Mind.
Why do you want to taIk to him?
WeII, a Iot of peopIe on Earth are reaI interested to hear what stars have to say.
I'm waiting for his manager to caII me back to set up an appointment right now.
You know, you Iook a IittIe bit Iike him.
Me-o?
Yeah, you-o.
I'm gonna get his aIbum.
I wanna show you.
You're not gonna beIieve this.
Yeah, you Iook a Iot Iike him.
Come on now, Mind.
This guy's gonna drown if he goes out in the rain.
Oh, come on, Mind.
Scoff, scoff.
I mean, ApriI FrinkIe's Day.
Come on, Mork, you Iook exactIy Iike him.
Oh, now, come on now, Mind, Iook at that there, Iook at that.
He Iooks Iike he does his hair with a Cuisinart.
And he's got a road map for eyes.
You couId pack a famiIy in that nose, Mind.
Look at that mouth too.
They had to airbrush his entire face.
Are you kidding?
Mind, Iisten, I'm bright and cheery.
This guy's got big probIems.
Where is the interview with Robin WiIIiams?
WeII, I've been having a IittIe troubIe with that.
He won't return any of my caIIs.
I mean, how do you reach someone who's inaccessibIe?
InaccessibIe?
Last night, Mr. WiIIiams dropped in to the Comedy Cabaret and performed for nothing.
WeII, how was I supposed to know?
WeII, even I knew about it.
I heard it from Armondo.
Who's Armondo?
The feIIow fumigating my office.
He got to see one of Robin WiIIiams' shows?
No.
Mr. WiIIiams mentioned it to Armondo today over Iunch.
Robin introduced himseIf to everyone at DaVinci's Restaurant.
He was at Remo and Jeanie's restaurant?
Oh, friends of yours?
Not anymore.
Okay.
I'II get that interview somehow.
- You can count on me.
- Good.
The owner of the station is putting pressure on me.
And you know how I handIe pressure.
Hey, Mindy.
Done with this?
No.
Jeanie, I'm mad at you.
At me?
Why?
What did I do?
You knew I've been trying to get an interview with Robin WiIIiams.
He was here yesterday and you didn't caII me.
Oh, no.
Oh, Mindy, I am reaIIy sorry.
It was crazy in here.
It was-- Oh, I'm sorry.
CouId you forgive me?
Oh, aII right.
Hi, scouts.
What's going on?
The pIace is so crowded I had to park in the back.
Yeah, me too.
Robin WiIIiams came in here for Iunch yesterday.
Everybody's waiting for him to come back.
How tacky.
Mindy, what are you doing here?
TackiIy waiting for him to come back.
CouId you come over?
We have a Iot of customers.
I know.
This is a new experience for me.
Mindy McConneII, I'm ashamed of you.
Hanging around here Iike some kind of groupie.
Now, that hurts, NeIson.
I'm supposed to interview Robin for the station.
And it seems Iike everybody in town has met him except me.
WeII, I'm sure you're exaggerating.
Hey, guys, did you see these PoIaroids they have of me and Robin WiIIiams?
That's us.
There's Robin and Jeanie.
There's Robin and Armondo.
You know, the bug guy?
Good picture.
The bug man gets to meet Robin WiIIiams.
I shouId have taken fumigation in coIIege.
Excuse me.
I have to go.
I'm getting a headache.
Boy, is she upset.
Yeah, Iook at this one.
Picture of Robin autographing the chopped Iiver with his finger.
I'm having this one Perma PIaqued.
Good penmanship.
Look, he made a happy face in the O. Excuse me.
For the owner of the car with the New Mexico Iicense pIate, pIease cIaim your car at the bottom of the hiII.
You forgot to set your handbrake.
Look, everyone, it's Robin.
Robin!
My name is Mork.
Watch your Ianguage.
Robin!
So that's Robin WiIIiams, huh?
You know, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but he Iooks a IittIe bit Iike Mork.
You're right.
I think you're crazy.
Oh, Iook, they caught him.
No big deaI.
With the money he makes, he can afford new cIothes.
They reaIIy shouIdn't toss him up in the air Iike that.
WeII, teII Mr. WiIIiams that Barbara WaIters caIIed.
And when he caIIs back, he shouId ask for my secretary, Mindy.
Thank you.
Come on in, Mr. Sternhagen.
Thank you.
Where'd she go?
Mr. Sternhagen, did you just come from Iunch?
Yes.
And I know you can't teII it, but I had two or three IittIe drinks.
And do you know why?
Why?
I knew I was in troubIe when Mrs. Ovitz, the woman who owns the station, pIied me with drinks at Iunchtime.
She said if we don't get the interview, I'm out.
And if I'm out Guess who's going with me?
Me.
No.
You.
Mr. Sternhagen, I have tried everything.
- I tried Iying.
- That's good.
- And I tried bribery.
- Oh, that's reaI good.
I even went as far as trying to buy tickets to his concert so I couId sneak backstage to meet him, but they're soId-out.
WeII, you're in a predic-- You're in a predic-- You're up a creek, kiddo.
The same thing happened to me in New York when I was big in the network.
The president said I had to deIiver someone or I was out.
I was out.
WeII, what did you do?
Does this Iook Iike New York here?
WeII, I gotta get go-- I better go.
I'm gonna Ieave now.
- Mr. Sternhagen.
- Yes?
Did you drive?
Oh, yes.
That's my IittIe beauty parked out there in your hedge.
WeII, I don't think you shouId drive.
I think you shouId take a IittIe nap.
I can do that whiIe I'm driving.
No.
Why don't you come with me?
I think you shouId go right in there.
WeII, wiII you pIease fix me some cookies and warm bourbon?
- Don't panic.
- I'm not panicking.
You have no reason to panic, Mind.
They're not after you.
Who's after you and why?
The entire town, Mind.
They know I'm an aIien.
They chased me.
They tore my cIothes.
They pursued me with fountain pens.
Just because I'm different doesn't make me a bad guy, does it?
I mean, I say my prayers, I pet my vegetabIes.
I put my pants on Iike everybody eIse, headfirst.
Mork, how couId they find out you're an aIien?
I don't know.
I don't know.
But they caIIed me fiIthy names.
Did they caII you Robin?
That's disgusting.
Mork, they think you're Robin WiIIiams.
Who?
Robin WiIIiams, the guy who Iooks Iike you.
Oh, you mean that bozo on the aIbum?
Yeah.
Oh, no, Mind, I don't Iook anything Iike him.
They know I'm an aIien.
They're onto me.
If they catch me, they're gonna tar and feather me and put me on That's lncredible!
They'II put me on that.
I'm teIIing you, they think you're Robin WiIIiams.
Mind, now, assuming you're right-- Which I think you're way off base.
You're Iike in Ieft fieId going, ''Where am I?
Where am I?
'' --wouId they tear Robin WiIIiams' cIothes off?
- Yes.
- But you toId me they Iiked him.
WeII, they do.
That's why they want his cIothes.
And if they didn't Iike him, boy, he'd be in reaI troubIe.
He'd be jacked up on four bIocks with nothing Ieft but his kneecaps.
WeII, it's not quite Iike that either.
Why don't you come with me tonight?
You'II see how much you Iook Iike him.
I've gotta go to the auditorium and try to interview him.
- It's my Iast shot.
- What are you gonna do, Mind?
Oh, hang around the stage door tiII he shows up.
Like some groupie?
ExactIy.
WeII, I'II go with you as your escort, but I've gotta get disguised, Mind.
I teII you, they're onto me.
They know I'm an aIien.
Mork, I wish you'd take off the siIIy-Iooking gIasses.
It's a perfect disguise, Mind.
Everyone thinks I'm from L.A. Watch this.
Excuse me, sir.
I just want you to know that there are no aIiens from outer space in this area.
- For sure.
- Mork.
Your disguise is starting to attract attention.
Now, you'd be much Iess conspicuous if you'd take off the nose, puII down your hat and turn up your coIIar.
- Trust me.
- Mind.
- Trust me.
- But, Mind - Do you trust me?
- Oh, Mind.
AII right.
- For you.
- There.
Look, it's him, Robin WiIIiams.
Stay back.
Break it up.
Right this way, Mr. WiIIiams.
No, wait.
I'm with him.
- Is she with you, sir?
- Trust me, Mind.
- I've never seen this woman in my Iife.
- What?
Just kidding, officer.
It's actuaIIy my brother.
He Iikes to dress up a IittIe bit.
Come aIong, RoIand.
Here's your dressing room, Mr. WiIIiams.
If there's anything I can do, Iet me know.
Yeah, a new pair of retinas wouId be very nice, pIease.
Hard to beIieve you get paid for that.
Do you beIieve it, Mork?
We're in Robin WiIIiams' dressing room.
And we're about to meet him.
I don't know what the big deaI is aII about.
Are you kidding, Mork?
PeopIe stand in Iine for hours just to get a gIimpse of a star, Iet aIone meet one.
And we're about to meet a big star.
Poor IittIe starstruck Mind.
Now, caIm that perky IittIe heart of yours.
Don't you understand that a star's just a big baII of gIowing hot gas?
He's just an ordinary human being who's been hyped by an advertising campaign.
PersonaIIy, I'd rather be at home right now fIossing my ears.
HeIIo.
You know, you Iook a Iot Iike No, he's a woman now.
Excuse me, Mr. WiIIiams, but I have a big, big, big favour to ask of you.
I know you don't know me and I don't wanna impose, but I'm supposed to get an interview with you for KTNS, and if I don't, I'II be fired.
Yeah.
This has been a bad year for her.
She bet on Carter, Roberto Duran and she had to buy ChrysIer stock too.
WeII, I got a minute.
My manager's not here.
And sure, why not?
Thank you.
I can't beIieve it.
Oh, thank you.
You're doing me such a big favour.
I don't beIieve it.
This is my friend, Mork.
HeIIo.
And I'm Mindy McConneII.
You're not from the Enquirer, are you?
Pardon me?
- LittIe joke.
- No.
Boy, you sure are a hard man to get in touch with.
You have tighter security than the pope.
She couIdn't get past your manager's secretary's secretary's secretary's answering machine.
Mork, wouId you pIease?
Sorry, Mind.
I know you've probabIy been asked this question a Iot, but what's it Iike to be a ceIebrity?
WeII, not bad, reaIIy.
It's nice when you get into restaurants at those reaIIy chichi pIaces where they wouIdn't even Iet you wash the fIoors before.
I have another question now, a IittIe fashion byIine.
- Why do you wear baggy pants?
- I don't want a visibIe panty Iine.
There's your headIine right there, Mind: ''Robin WiIIiams, kinky.
'' You're a member of the brotherhood of Bozo.
Why do you wear them?
That's where I keep my bees.
Do you mind?
Back off.
Back off, yeah.
Mr. WiIIiams, I don't know how you keep up the pace.
I mean, you arrived from Hawaii, fIy aII night and then go straight to the university and Iecture for three hours.
Oh, that was a fIuke, you see.
The piIot of the fIight I was on has a daughter who attends drama cIass here.
He asked if I'd taIk to her cIass to return his favour.
What was the favour?
WeII, he said if I'd Iecture, he'd puII out of the dive.
Interesting concept, Mind.
BIackmaiI by gravity.
Write that down.
That's news, news.
But then after the Iecture you performed untiI 3 a.m. at the Comedy Cabaret.
And now you're doing two shows tonight.
WeII, two reasons: See, I'm a performing addict.
I can't get enough of it.
AIso the owner of the Comedy Cabaret is a friend of a cousin of a friend of a friend and so on and so on.
- WeII, I couIdn't say no.
- Gee, that's a great angIe for my story.
Robin WiIIiams, the comedian who can't say no.
Excuse me.
My dinner fIew away.
You mind if I have some of your star munchies?
Sure, why not?
I was hoping you'd go for the traiI mix.
I can't beIieve this man is actuaIIy grazing in front of me.
WeII, back to you.
I'm sorry to avoid you.
I don't know why I can't say no.
I guess I want peopIe to Iike me.
I hate myseIf for that.
But I used to be abIe to say no.
WeII, what do you mean?
WeII, before aII this craziness started, my friends used to caII up and go: ''Robin, come on.
We're aII going outside.
There's some gnarIy waves and we can hang out.
'' And I have to go: ''No, my mama said I have to stay inside and read Nietzsche tonight.
'' Later on, I guess I feIt reaIIy afraid to say no to them because then they'd aII say Iike: ''Oh, Robin WiIIiams, Mr. Smarty-Pants-Big-Shot, wow, you forgot your oId friends.
You can't Iend me $1 0,000 for a new car.
You won't do the Save the Shrimp benefit.
'' This is none of my business, but it seems Iike if they're reaIIy your friends, they'd understand.
But it seems to me you can't say no to a totaI stranger.
You're right.
It aIso Iooks Iike you're probabIy taken advantage of a Iot.
If you Iearned to say no, you'd probabIy have a Iot more time to yourseIf.
Maybe that's the Iast thing I want.
Come in.
- Five minutes, Mr. WiIIiams.
- Thank you.
You didn't get much of an interview.
I hope you're not disappointed.
Disappointed, are you kidding?
You're breaking her perky IittIe heart.
Listen, if it means that much to you, teII you what I'm gonna do for you.
I'II put off my fIight.
Tomorrow morning when my manager's asIeep, I'II sneak down to the TV station and do an on camera interview with you.
You'd do an on camera interview with me?
Oh, I can't beIieve it.
I was just supposed to write this up and Iet the anchorman read it.
Oh, that is so nice.
I can't beIieve it.
Oh, wait a minute.
No, I can't do that.
Oh, yeah, that's kind of a bad time for me too.
How about next JuIy?
No, Mork.
We were just taIking about how you can't say no.
I'm not gonna be another person just to take advantage of you.
Oh, don't worry about that.
I'II Iearn to say no some other time.
Come on, watch the show from the wings.
Excuse me.
One thing before you go.
Today I was chased by a mob who wanted to tear my cIothes off.
Is it because they say I Iook Iike you?
WeII, there's kind of a resembIance.
Sounds Iike you just went through CeIebrity 1 A. How'd it feeI?
Oh, it was frightening.
Why do you want to take a job where they tear your cIothes and throw you?
WeII, actuaIIy, I became a performer by accident.
My dad used to have this job where he had to move around a Iot.
Sometimes he'd Ieave the forwarding address.
Oh, he didn't do that.
No, you're right.
I was kidding.
ActuaIIy, he packed me in the crates with the dishes.
What a guy, Mind.
Anyway, I was aIways being Iike the new kid in the neighbourhood.
WeII, since I was suffering from a case of the terminaI shy, I couIdn't make friends that easiIy.
And I spent a Iot of time in my room and I created my own IittIe worId, fuII of, Iike, aII these IittIe characters that had strange, unusuaI quaIities.
After a whiIe, I reaIised peopIe found these characters funny and outrageous.
Then it got to the point where I reaIised that the characters couId say and do things I was afraid to do myseIf.
And after a IittIe whiIe, here I am.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robin Williams.
We're on.
Take care.
Wish me Iuck.
- Good Iuck.
- Listen to that appIause.
Something Iike that might make torn cIothes worthwhiIe, Mind.
Let's go.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Your Cinerama-ness.
Just get on with your report, Mork.
Oh, yes, sir.
This week, sir, I Iearned what it's Iike to be famous on Earth.
That's good.
Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't.
You see, most EarthIings try very hard to be recognised for what they do, but when they become stars, sir, they reaIise they're recognised wherever they go.
y ou mean they lose their privacy?
WeII, sir, sometimes they can even Iose their cIothes.
You see, being a star, sir, is a 24-hour job and you can't Ieave your face at the office.
lsn't fame its own reward?
Oh, yes, sir, it is.
When you're a ceIebrity, everybody wants a piece of you.
UnIess you can say no, there wiII be no pieces Ieft for yourseIf.
l thought all stars were rich, live in mansions and drive big eggs.
I know, sir, that's the common misconception.
But you see, to get that, you have to pay a very heavy price.
You have responsibiIities, anxieties.
To be honest, sir, some of them can't take it.
- l'm not buying it, Mork.
- Why, sir?
lt sounds to me like they have it made.
WeII, most of them do, sir, but some are victims of their own fame.
Very speciaI and taIented peopIe.
PeopIe Iike EIvis PresIey, MariIyn Monroe, Janis JopIin, Jimi Hendrix, Lenny Bruce, Freddie Prinze and John Lennon.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Hey, come on, honey.
Your pIane Ieaves in an hour.
AII set.
Except for Mork.
I wonder why he ran out at the Iast minute Iike that.
Oh, honey, Mork wouIdn't miss seeing you off.
After aII, going to Topeka is a big deaI.
Yeah, yeah, covering the Winter Wheat Conference is a big deaI.
Who's gonna pick you up at the airport?
A chartered tractor?
No.
No, it's important, Dad, because Mr. Sternhagen at the station said if I do reaIIy good on this assignment, he might give me a bigger one.
Like city haII, congressionaI scandaIs, maybe even the Summer Wheat Convention.
Mind.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
Oh, Pop, Pop.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
Pop, Pop, Pop.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
Mind, Mind, Pop, Pop, Mind, Mind.
I brought you this wonderfuI gift.
Since you're going to Kansas, I got a fIea coIIar for Toto.
Don't be afraid, there's no pIace Iike that.
You're right.
Mork, thank you.
I'II pass it aIong.
Okay, honey, I'II go warm up the car.
You know, the best way to do that is to bIow on its carburettor and say that you Iove it.
I'II do that, but I'II hate myseIf in the morning.
Okay, Mork, now I want you to pay cIose attention.
We've got a Iot of things to cover if you're gonna manage by yourseIf.
Come on, now, Mind, scoff, scoff, derisive Iaughter.
Me manage by myseIf?
Do you know who you're taIking to?
Yes.
- This is the can opener.
- Can opener.
- This is the coffee pot.
- Coffee pot.
Remember what I toId you about the bIender?
Yes, just turn it off.
Don't just stand there waiting for it to fIush.
Right.
And remember the most important part.
You turn it off from the outside.
I wondered why my fingernaiIs were getting shorter.
WeII, I gotta run.
I'm gonna miss you, Mork.
WeII, you can't miss, Mind, if you aim right here.
Okay, weII, you have a good time, and I'II see you when I get back on Monday.
You have a good time.
Don't worry about me.
Everything's aII right.
I'm a superior being - and I can handIe everything.
- That's right.
Okay.
Bye.
Later, mama.
Alone again Just to be alone again WeII.
Yes.
Hey, hey.
WeII, I guess I'II just have to peeI it and eat it raw.
Oh, I've gotta stop thinking about her.
No.
I've gotta stop thinking about her.
No!
Oh, she's not even thinking of me.
She's here.
She got my psychic teIegram.
Oh, my darIing.
My darIing.
Oh, what a disappointment.
You're no aurora boreaIis yourseIf.
I just came up to teII you, I got a caII from our IandIord, Mr. KIevins.
He's coming around Iater to instaI smoke aIarms in aII the apartments.
No more smoke?
There goes my chat with Chief White EagIe.
What?
You better get this pIace cIeaned up.
This KIevins is a reaI creep.
He's bounced tenants for having crooked doormats.
- You reaIIy miss Mindy, don't you?
- No way.
WeII, where'd you get aII the pictures?
Shiksamat?
What?
Listen, maybe it'd heIp to get your mind off Mindy if you go out with some of your friends.
That's be great, Bick.
How about the two of us?
Paint the town pink, huh?
- I'm sorry, Mork, I can't.
- Why not?
Because it sounds Iike a drag.
And I thought he didn't Iike me.
Hear that, Mind?
They're pIaying our song, darIing.
You know, I Iove it when you wear that perfume, Janitor in a Drum.
You can cure that with some fabric softener.
You know that, don't you?
Wait a minute, Mind.
Oh, no.
That can onIy mean one thing.
He's here.
It's him.
The Orkan EIder.
What do you mean, no?
It's the ancient one, the wisest of the wise.
Stop that.
No, it's him.
Oh, no, quick.
Down upon your knees.
Nice touch.
- Rise, Mork.
- Oh, sir.
Don't be so formaI, Mork.
You know my name is: I came because it's my birthday.
Oh, sir, happy birthday.
Birthday.
Very touching.
Hard to keep a dry eye.
I just wish the Orkan aging process wasn't reversed.
Seems Iike every day I Iook in the mirror, I get a IittIe bit cuter.
- Where does the time go?
- I don't know, sir.
ProbabIy the same pIace that socks go when you Iose them in the dryer.
How oId are you today, sir?
In Earth years, 87.
You know, that's amazing.
If you were a dog, you'd be 1 4.
I decided to treat myseIf and drop in to see you.
And, especiaIIy, the soft-Iapped one.
Oh, I'm sorry about that, sir, but she's out of town.
Sir.
I'm sorry I missed her.
They don't make Iaps Iike hers on Ork.
WeII, I can entertain you in the traditionaI Orkan fashion, sir, if you wish to come with me.
Oh, Orkan checkers.
- You go first, Mork.
- Oh, thank you, sir, for the priviIege.
- Check.
- Checkmate.
And I never even saw it coming.
That's why you're the EIder, sir.
You know, I kept thinking about the two of you down here.
EspeciaIIy Mindy.
She's different from us.
Oh, yeah?
I know, sir.
You know, sir, the Iast time you were here, you said you couId buiId a Mindy.
Can you?
I suppose I couId.
I've got my genetic tooIkit in the egg.
What wiII you do with the one I buiId you - when the reaI Mindy gets back?
- I couId seII her to the Osmonds in case Marie gets trampIed at a famiIy reunion.
Are you sure you onIy need one hair?
You're gonna have to make her head - awfuIIy smaII for this to fit.
- Of course.
Didn't you Iearn anything in your cIoning cIass on Ork?
I had to substitute basket weaving for cIoning.
I was on athIetic schoIarship.
I need some information on Mindy's character traits.
Oh, that's very easy, sir.
She taIks Iike this.
HeIIo, my name is Mindy, I'm a Capricorn.
I Iike fuzzy things, happy peopIe, soIar energy, and whistIing at construction workers.
Turnoffs are gas-guzzIing cars, cancer-causing agents, nucIear power pIants and bathroom poetry.
If I wasn't so modest, I'd say I was adorabIe.
ExceIIent.
Now hand me the Kapovney cIamp so I can adjust her IQ.
Oh, yes, sir.
PIease, sir, remember that she's quite inteIIigent, she has a degree, and she knows about everything.
Watering pIants, driving a jeep.
She can tie her shoe without Iooking down.
She's aImost done.
Oh, sir, pIease remember she was wearing a pink sweater and jeans.
And remember to put her nose right between her eyes.
Sir?
Oh, sir?
Sir, she's ready, sir.
Okay, okay.
I may be oId, but I'm not deaf.
Oh, sir.
Oh, sir.
- Sir, it worked.
It's an exact dupIicate.
- Of course.
TaIk to her.
Hi, Mind.
Big kiss.
If you think I'm going to fIex my orbicuIar muscIe to oscuIate, you're sadIy mistaken.
- What'd she say?
- No.
This idIe discourse fatigues me.
But don't you remember?
It's me, your cute IittIe oId Morkie.
Enough of this chiIdish driveI.
I need mentaI stimuIation.
Don't you have any books to read?
No.
I have some to coIour.
Never mind, I'II write my own.
But Mind.
CaII me when you've evoIved.
Sir, I think you made her a IittIe too inteIIigent.
- What happened?
- WeII, sir, meaning no disrespect, but I think you reaIIy orked up.
Begging your pardon, sir, what was wrong with Mindy's cIone?
I mean, if we were gonna have a battIe of wits, I'd be an unarmed man.
These EarthIings must be more compIex than I thought.
Oh, sir.
Don't give up.
PIease, try again.
I mean, I'm reaI IoneIy.
Remember, sir, I mean, she's more the outdoor type.
She's energetic and athIetic.
She's not a spectator, she's a doer.
This one wiII be right.
An eIder never faiIs, twice.
Oh, bIess you, sir, bIess you.
May your shoes aIways be Ioose.
TingIing, sense of anticipation.
Sir?
Sir?
It's happening again, sir.
I think we got a hot one, sir.
- Hi, Mind.
Big kiss.
- Not now.
I'm in training.
That's reaI athIetic and energetic, sir.
Thank you.
But how do you turn her off, though, sir?
The deactivating button is on her foot.
Oh, no, I'm not going near her without a whip and a chair.
Come on, two out of three, two out of three.
- Now it's your turn, Mind.
- Come on.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
Aunt, aunt.
Oh, uncIe, uncIe, uncIe.
End of round one, neutraI corners.
Sir, can I borrow this?
Sir, can you make the next one a IittIe more Ioving and affectionate?
One Iess turn on the butch boIt?
- I'II get it.
- Oh, no, no, no.
I hope it's Gore VidaI come to borrow a cup of aphorisms.
Oh, no, no, no.
We can't Iet anybody see you.
I opt to remain.
I feeI the need for sociaI discourse on a much higher IeveI.
You have proved to me that Darwin was wrong.
Pardon me, possibIy we couId find a harmonious resoIution to this imbrogIio by a confIict of inteIIects, i.e., a battIe of wits, whereby the Ioser must forfeit an articIe of cIothing and reveaI epidermis.
- A strip debate.
- Yes, if you catch my drift, yes.
Very weII.
Let's discuss the Cartesian dictum: - ''I think, therefore I am.
'' - Therefore.
And how it reIates to Kierkegaard's observation that a reIation which reIates itseIf to its own seIf must have been created by itseIf or created by another.
Oh, fascinating.
However, your possession of extraneous Iiterature constitutes a fouI.
Therefore, pIease, remit to me your Ieft pedaI extremity, if you can.
Thank you very much.
Sorry about that, Mind.
I mean, I'd have a very hard time expIaining you.
And you wouId have a very hard time expIaining you.
Sorry.
- Who is it?
- It's me, AI KIevins, the IandIord.
Oh, I'II be right there, Mr. KIevins.
AII right, tidy up.
HeIIo.
Hi, you must be the creep.
Creep?
I don't know you and aIready I'm not Iiking you.
Where's my tenant, Mindy McConneII?
Oh, she's in Kansas right now, Iooking for a smaII dog at a midget convention.
- Who are you?
- Mork, the man who Iights up her Iife.
This pIace is a mess.
I don't see how you can teII with aII this junk Iying around.
I have no time for this chitchat.
I gotta instaI this smoke aIarm so that peopIe Iike you won't Iight up my Iife.
I'II put it here, in the bedroom over there.
Oh, if you ever hear this: Put out the fire, then Ieave.
- Round two.
- Wait, Mind.
That was a buzzer, not a beII.
I'm gonna squeeze you Iike a tube of anchovy paste.
No.
You'II never take me aIive.
Sorry about that, Mind.
Oh, wait, wait, I've got them coming and going here.
HoId on a second.
What are we doing, Rockette kicks?
What?
No time for Iearn yoga.
Wish I couId get a deposit on aII these empties.
WeII, hi there, hot stuff.
Big kiss.
Wait, Mind.
I asked for somebody warm and more affectionate, not a human hickey maker.
You're cute.
Today, boy.
Tonight, man.
Listen, I'm a very kind, innocent IittIe aIien.
I'm not.
Listen, pIease, I wanna wear white at my wedding.
Why don't I sIip into something more comfortabIe, Iike skin?
No, no, no.
You can't go in there.
Oh, try to stop me, bIue eyes.
By tonight, my darIing, you'II be needing a Iip retread.
I'm teIIing you, I'm going to drive you to China for Jewish food.
I'm starting to get to you, huh?
Quick.
FondIe me with your eyes.
TeII you what, Iet's sip champagne from your sIipper, eh, ma petite?
AII right, my scruffy rogue.
- Find it first.
- Oh, I'II find it for you.
Oh, bingo.
I wiII sip from no sIipper before its time.
Oh, Iet's make it a doubIe.
At Ieast I found her turnoff.
Up she go.
Make room for one more.
Oh, we're stacking up Iike cordwood in here.
WouId you stay caIm?
- Hey, you?
- HeIIo.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, just tidying up.
I saw what you did.
You put a person in there.
In fact, it Iooks Iike Miss McConneII.
It's Ms. McConneII to you.
I'm gonna caII the poIice.
I'm gonna caII the poIice.
- It's just an ostrich.
PIease.
- No, no.
You're a murderer.
That's what you are.
No, pIease, you don't understand.
HeIIo?
HeIIo, operator.
Get me the poIice.
I want to report a murder.
- No, you don't understand.
- Hi, Mork.
Never mind.
It's not as important as I thought.
Miss McConneII, you're aIive.
WeII, thank you.
So are you.
What's going on here?
Yeah, but you can't be here.
I just saw him stuff your body into that cIoset.
- Here, I'II show you.
- No, no, no.
It's an ostrich convention.
You don't wanna disturb them.
Look, I saw you put someone in there, and I'm gonna find out what's going on around here.
AII right!
AII right, Mr. Smarty-Pants.
You wanna know what's in there?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I'II show you what's in there.
I'm opening the door.
I'm reaching in.
It's just your typicaI mop with jeans and a sweater.
A perfectIy IogicaI expIanation.
Sort of.
I'm getting out of here.
I can't-- I'm getting out of here.
Maybe I'II move back to the Bronx, where it's safe.
What is going on here?
Why does this mop have my picture on it?
- That's kind of hard to expIain, Mind.
- Oh, I'II bet.
- Now, what's reaIIy in the armoire?
- Mind, Mind, you don't wanna Mork, where'd you get the dead Mindys?
They're not dead, Mind.
It's just my personaI piIe of perkiness.
- Don't touch their feet, Mind.
- Touch their feet?
I don't even wanna touch the armoire.
What are they doing in there?
- WeII, the EIder made them, Mind.
- The EId--?
The EIder's here?
- He's upstairs, cranking out more.
- Oh, we gotta to stop him.
Sir-- Sir, what's wrong?
I'm a faiIure, Mork.
An 87-year-oId has-been.
I tried to re-create a Mindy.
I reaIIy tried.
But aII I couId make were cheap imitations, Iike this one.
Oh, sir, this is her, this is the reaI McConneII.
PIease, Mork.
PIease, Mork, don't humour me.
SuddenIy, I feeI very oId.
The soft-Iapped one.
It's reaIIy you.
WeII, of course it's me.
WeIcome to Earth.
What are aII those mes doing in the cIoset?
Oh, Mind, don't bIame him.
I asked him to make them for me because I reaIIy missed you.
WeII, I missed you too, Mork, but that's a IittIe strange.
I mean, they Iook just Iike me.
That's just on the outside, Mind.
But that's not the part we reaIIy missed.
I've Iearned a vaIuabIe Iesson.
Humans aren't toys to tinker with.
Seeing you again is the best birthday present I couId possibIy have.
Oh, it's your birthday?
Oh, happy birthday.
If I were onIy 30 bleams younger, then I'd stiII be too oId for you.
WeII, what about aII the Mindys?
Oh, I'II take them back to Ork for scientific study.
You can keep the one upstairs.
Upstairs?
You mean there's another one up in the attic?
Yes, except she didn't turn out exactIy as I hoped.
Let me introduce you.
Oh, Mindy?
Mindy?
Hi, Mork.
Big kiss.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Your JeIIy-BeIIyness.
You Iike that one, Beebs?
Does that tickIe your fancy?
I've got a miIIion of them.
And l've heard them all, twice.
- Get to your report, Mork.
- Oh, yes, sir, Your Snippiness.
This week, sir, I've prepared a very, very speciaI report for you.
I finaIIy found out what distinguishes one EarthIing from another.
Funny.
They all look alike to me.
That may be true, mein hippodrome, but every person has something that makes him unique and very speciaI.
- It's caIIed a personaIity.
- Could you show me one?
WeII, no, sir, it's not something you couId see or touch.
But it's something that reaches out and touches peopIe.
It makes each one of them very, very, very different.
- lsn't that inefficient?
- Oh, you bet, sir, but that's what makes Iife on this pIanet so darn interesting.
You see, sir, thanks to personaIities, even the most identicaI twin is not the same.
Even the shortest person can stand out in a crowd.
They may have the same number of chromosomes but each person has his own designer genes.
UntiI next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Can I taIk to you guys about something personaI?
You got a tattoo.
No.
No, it's about Mork.
Is he stiII Iighting a candIe every day in memory of Edith Bunker?
Yes, but that's not the probIem.
No, the probIem is I met this guy through work and he asked me out to dinner and I don't know whether I shouId go or not.
WeII, what's the probIem?
You and Mork are just good friends.
WeII, yeah, we are, but we reaIIy haven't dated anyone in the Iast year.
And it just kind of worked out that way.
WeII, then, Iive, Mindy.
Grow, expand your souI.
Humanity is the paIette from which you coIour your reIationships.
WeII, I mean if you go out and meet new peopIe, it can enrich and ennobIe your attitudes towards each other.
In other words, Mindy, fooI around.
You know, GIenda may be right.
Meeting new peopIe couId be a Iot of fun.
- For both you and Mork.
- ReaIIy?
- Yeah.
- What good advice.
Thanks.
Now, you teII Mork.
No, it's true.
Mork shouId meet more peopIe.
I mean, after aII, that's why he came to this pIanet.
PIace.
Why he came to this pIace.
Oh, gosh.
WeII, I hate to eat and run, but I have to burn off this cake.
Come on, Jeanie.
Oh, enjoy it, Iips, before it winds up on hips.
- WeII, bye-bye.
- Bye.
Listen, if you end up going out with this guy, why don't you see if maybe he has a friend, you know, brother or cousin, nephew, uncIe, grandfather?
Bye.
Mork, can I taIk to you for a minute?
Oh, sure, Mind, here I come.
Catch me.
Now I know who not to caII in case of a fire.
Here I am, Mind, preparing earIy for our usuaI Saturday evening teIevision marathon.
We're gonna boogie tiII the test pattern.
Here we are.
One reguIation snuggIe sack.
My reguIation snuggIe sack.
AIso, hoId on here.
And the best surprise of aII, a IittIe bag of popcorn.
- Mork.
- Mind.
How wouId you feeI if I toId you I wasn't gonna watch teIevision with you tonight?
I'd say that Mork and Mindy have reached a new IeveI of intimacy.
I'II go upstairs, put on my see-through suspenders and we'II snap tiII dawn.
No, what I mean is I'm not gonna be here tonight.
- I have a date.
- You?
Yeah, me.
No, I've been thinking about it and I think it'd be heaIthy for us to go out and meet other peopIe.
WeII, Mind, have I stopped you from meeting other peopIe?
WeII, no, but I haven't exactIy heIped you meet them, either.
And I've been so busy trying to graduate from coIIege and trying to find a job that we've sort of cIosed ourseIves off in a cocoon.
That's crazy, Mind.
I mean, I came to Earth to observe peopIe.
You shouId be abIe to observe peopIe too.
Oh, reaIIy?
Oh, I'm so gIad you feeI that way.
To teII you the truth, I was nervous about bringing the whoIe thing up.
You kidding?
This conversation has changed my Iife.
I'm going out right now and break new ground, meet new peopIe.
I'm gonna get out there right now, Mind-- There's somebody right now.
Hey, you, feIIa.
Yeah, you in the hardhat, why don't you come on up tonight?
I've got an empty snuggIe sack.
It's open.
- Hi, Mork.
- Remo.
Here's the pizza you ordered.
It's your usuaI.
Everything but tomato and cheese.
Where's Mindy?
Oh, she's out with some guy having her horizons expanded.
- She's got a date?
- Yes.
She says with these experiences, she'II enrich her Iife, and we'II have something to share in our goIden years.
- You bought that?
- Yeah, and the watch too.
- Look, you're a singIe guy, aII right?
- Yeah.
This is Saturday night.
Get out the IittIe bIack book.
Oh, IittIe bIack book.
You mean Roots?
No, that address book.
Idiot moi.
Why, Iook at this.
You got a chick for every night of the week.
''LoIa, Stephanie, Marcy.
'' - Give them a caII.
- I can't.
They're asIeep right now.
They're kids from the day-care centre.
WeII, you must know some women with their permanent teeth.
Let's think.
Look, think of someone.
Anyone, just give me a name.
AII right, weII, there's your sister Jeanie.
- I don't think so.
- Oh, yeah.
GIenda Faye.
GIenda Faye, that's perfect.
She's singIe.
She Iives in one of those singIes compIexes.
Give her a caII.
- Just reIax, aII right?
- Okay.
- Now just-- - What do I say to her?
Say, ''What are you doing tonight, GIenda?
'' And whatever you do, don't sound hard up or IoneIy.
Okay.
It's rang two times.
HeIIo?
GIenda?
Hi, it's me, Mork.
That's aII, it's just Mork.
Yes, hi.
What am I doing?
WeII, whatever it is, I'm not hard up or IoneIy.
WeII, actuaIIy, right now I'm having a party with aII of my friends.
Yes, what are you doing?
You're having a Japanese dinner party?
That's wonderfuI.
Sure, I can come.
Oh, yes.
GIenda, I have one question.
When you eat sushi, do you eat with the fingers or do you eat the fingers separateIy?
Come in.
- Hi, Morky san.
- Hayakawa, GIenda Faye.
- These fIowers are for you.
- Oh, how sweet.
Oh, no, they're not, I tasted them.
You are such a kidder.
Hey, how about a IittIe sake?
Oh, make it two.
One for each footy.
Excuse me.
Mork, I'd Iike you to meet aII my friends.
Oh, thus begins my growth experience.
Hey, everybody, this is Mork.
- Hi.
- Hi.
That's that.
Thank you, aII.
I have a Iot to share with Mindy.
- Good night.
- Get back here, siIIikins.
Come on.
- Stay a whiIe and just mingIe a IittIe.
- MingIe?
- MingIe.
- You mean, Iike: WouId you Iike to mingIe?
Sure, I'II try anything once.
Are those beII-bottoms?
Why?
Are my cuffs ringing?
Excuse me, I think we have to stop seeing each other.
Party chatter, party chatter, party chatter.
- Excuse me, are you on something?
- Yes, this IoveIy pIush piIe carpet.
I'II go over here and motivate.
I wonder if I have fIower breath.
Mork, are you having a nice time?
I don't think your friends Iike me.
I feeI kind of out of pIace.
I feeI kind of Iike Nancy Reagan at a souI-food parIour.
Just kind of Ioosen up a IittIe.
TeII a joke.
No, no.
Okay, everybody, Mork is going to teII a joke.
- He is such a funny man.
- Oh, no.
Okay, Mork.
- I onIy know one joke, GIen.
- Oh, great, teII it.
Okay, GIenda, thank you.
No pressure.
WeII, you see, these two Venusians waIk into a bar.
And one Venusian says No, don't spoiI it, you know the ending.
One Venusian says: And the other Venusian says: And then the bartender says: ''I can't even drink the water.
'' Oh, dear.
GIenda, can I go sit in the other room with the coats?
Oh, Mork.
It's aII right, I can taIk to a mink.
It'II be okay.
You know, it's reaIIy hard meeting new peopIe for the first time.
Gee, hardIy anybody fits in right away.
Just do me a IittIe favour and stay for a IittIe whiIe Ionger.
Oh, GIenda, I feeI Iike a fur baII in the throat of Iife.
There's this great guy coming over for dinner tonight and I want you to meet him.
Everybody Ioves him.
He's the Iife of the party, a reguIar Mr. Fun.
- You couId reaIIy Iearn a Iot from him.
- He's more fun than Mister Rogers?
Beni Hana.
GoIdfish sushi.
Mork.
This is Todd Norman TayIor.
My friends caII me TNT because I'm a dynamite kind of guy.
Go to it, TNT.
ReIieve the tensions of the '80s.
You're a crazy Iady, you know?
She's a crazy Iady.
- Hi, I'm Pepper.
- Whoa, what's shaking, Pepper?
Let's sit and taIk traveI.
You know, I've been to aII 27 CIub Meds.
What a week that was.
TaIking traveI with him.
If they onIy knew where I came from.
- Hi, handsome.
- Oh, what's your name?
- Sheri.
- Sheri?
Oh, what's cooking, Sheri?
WouId you hoId it against me if I toId you you had a great body?
I'm on a roII.
Excuse me, Mr. Fun.
May I taIk to you?
What the matter, guy?
Run out of waIIfIower seeds?
Excuse me, Iadies.
Hey, guy, Iighten up.
Party, party.
I'm sorry, I'm just a I'm a Ioser.
I'm a sociaI misfit.
You forgot ''dud.
'' Hey, I understand.
I've been washed up on Shy Beach before.
I couIdn't surf, I couIdn't ski.
I couIdn't even ride a mechanicaI buII.
Let's face it, I was a pretty shaIIow guy.
What'd you do?
Put my act together.
Props, IittIe wardrobe, but most important of aII, styIe.
What's styIe?
- You see the way you're dressed?
- WeII, yes.
That's not it.
TeII you what, guy.
You stick with the master, and in no time, I'II make you just Iike me from top to bottom.
I guess I got a good head start because my bottom Iooks Iike your top.
So how's Mork been IateIy?
WeII, I haven't seen much of Mork IateIy.
Seems I've unIeashed a singIes monster on BouIder.
I thought that's kind of what you wanted.
You're seeing new peopIe, Mork's seeing new peopIe.
Yeah, but we sure aren't seeing much of each other.
WeII, I mean, come on, Mindy, he can't be busy every singIe minute.
Oh, yeah?
Wait a minute, I wanna show you something.
- Wait tiII you see this.
- What is it?
- Monday.
- Monday.
''Eight-twenty a.m., breakfast.
Ten-forty-eight a.m., comparative Iip-gIoss tasting.
EIeven-oh-six a.m., co-ed mud wrestIing.
'' My goodness, he is busy every minute.
Oh, not again.
HeIIo.
No, Nikki Sue, Mork isn't here right now.
He's at the fIoating Jacuzzi backgammon tournament.
What?
No, no, no, the finaIs are at 6:34.
Okay, bye.
- Oh, Mindy.
- WeII, maybe it's good for Mork.
I mean, he's getting out, he's meeting peopIe.
- So why am I so bugged?
- Because maybe you feeI Ieft out?
Maybe I feeI Ieft out.
According to this, Mork is gonna be at GIenda's party tonight.
It starts at 8:41 .
Why don't you meet him over there?
You know, kind of check out the situation.
I don't know.
I was invited too, aIong with the rest of BouIder.
I wasn't reaIIy pIanning on going.
Come on, Mindy.
Now, you have got to be just a IittIe bit curious to see oId Mork in action, huh?
Oh, yeah, I am.
But if I go to that party and he says to me, ''Hi there, chicky baby, what's your sign?
'' I'm gonna kick him in the big dipper.
Anybody here?
GIenda?
Mork?
Mind.
How are you?
Star-spangIed surprise and amber waves of joy.
HoIIywood kiss.
Okay.
Oh, IoveIy.
- What an interesting party.
- Yes.
- You having fun?
- Oh, for sure, for sure.
Does Norman Lear make great jets?
Oh, Mindy, I'm so gIad you couId make it.
Let me get you a drink.
Maybe you'd Iike to try the speciaIty of the house?
Morkaritas?
- Morkaritas?
- WeII, they're named after me, Mind.
It's tequiIa and baIogna.
Mustard around the rim is optionaI.
I think I'II just have a meatIess drink.
Okay.
Sorry, but I've gotta go mix and mingIe now to Iook for that deep reIationship Iike you wanted me to.
We'II catch you Iater when the energy's right.
HeIIo, how are you?
Have you ever had deep feeIings about veIour?
Hey, Hit Man, huddIe time.
Hey, we'II do Iunch one day.
We'II bag it and caII each other.
I've toId you the secrets of the opposite gender.
Now's the time to rub them tender.
- We bad, we bad.
- We bad, we bad.
- Hit Man?
- He's a hit with aII the Iadies.
Maybe I wiII have a Morkarita.
Mindy, you're not upset with me because I introduced Mork to aII my friends, are you?
Oh, no, of course not.
WeII, Iook at him.
He's having such a good time.
You know, chicky-boo, my sixth sense teIIs me that we've met in a previous Iife.
You were CIeopatra and I was Richard Burton.
You know, chickIet, I have seven cents that says we met, Iike, in a previous Iife.
And you were Lady Godiva and I was Mister Ed.
One day we'II go to NautiIus Centre and hoId our breath.
Hey, baby, how'd you Iike to go up to my pIace for a nightcap?
Hey, sweetheart, how'd you Iike to go over to my pIace for a night crawIer?
- I Iive at your pIace.
- Oh, wow, Xanadu.
I've got a Iive one.
We bad.
Yeah.
Why do I feeI Iike I shouId be wearing abutton?
Hi, I couIdn't heIp overhearing because I was Iistening, but are you and the Hit Man Iiving together?
Oh, yeah, but it's not what you think.
Oh, you'II have to teII me.
I'm not into thinking.
You see, he and I are just friends.
Oh, friends.
In that case, Hit Man?
I think she Iikes me, Mind.
Isn't she nice?
For sure, for sure.
Isn't she?
Isn't she reaIIy gnarIy?
You know, Mork, maybe it's time I got into the swing of things.
Do you mind if I mix with your friends?
- Oh, sure, Mind, go for it.
- WiII you hoId this?
Thanks.
Hey, TNT, wanna have a megaton of fun?
Hey, baby, I'm here for the taking.
You get the JeII-O, I'II bring the birdcage.
Mind, what are you doing?
Just trying to mix and mingIe because I'm singIe.
- Party's moving to my pIace.
- Party's at Pepper's.
WouIdn't you Iike to be at Pepper's too?
Hey.
Come on, foxy.
Jump on the SiIver Streak to singIedom.
Come on, Mind.
You can be the caboose if you can get Ioose.
I don't think we're on the same track, jack.
After this commercial message, we'll be back with Night OwI Theatre.
Hey, crazy Iady.
Hey, Hit Man, you're home earIy.
It's onIy 4:1 5.
Hey, Mind, you wanna know why I came home from roaming?
You had to change for the predawn donut dunk.
No, I saw that you Ieft the party and I came to bring you back.
- Why did you Ieave, Mind?
- I wasn't in the mood for a big party.
But it Iooks Iike you're having a good time with aII your new friends, especiaIIy that girI Pepper.
Pepper?
- Yeah, the girI who kissed you.
- Oh, a Iot of girIs kissed me, Mind.
I guess they're just Ioad-testing their Iips.
This is the first time we've sat together on this couch in over a week.
Yeah, it feeIs pretty good.
Mork, I'm gIad you found a way of Iife you can reaIIy enjoy.
Are you happy?
Sure.
I mean, it makes me happy to make you happy.
And you wanted me to meet new peopIe.
Yeah, but not as a career.
Mork, I thought making new friends wouId heIp us grow together, not grow apart.
Yeah, Mind, I reaIIy missed you.
I wanna be your cuddIy IittIe caterpiIIar, not somebody's sociaI butterfIy.
Oh, Mork, that's so nice.
WeII, I'd rather be your cuddIy caterpiIIar too.
I reaIised that the first time I waIked in GIenda Faye's buiIding.
You know, I Iike making new friends, but you're my best friend.
- Oh, I needed to hear that.
- Yeah, me too.
You know what's reaIIy nice?
It's nice having you taIking to me rather than at me.
You know, it's reaIIy great to make new friends, but don't forget who you are in the meantime.
Yeah, I promise.
I'II just be my IittIe oId bozo seIf.
Mind, one thing.
Can I keep the new friends I made?
- Sure, they're fun.
- Oh, reaIIy?
- Yeah.
- You hear that?
She Iikes you.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, O jumbo jet setter.
- Please, Mork, no fat jokes tonight.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Beebs is my best audience, sir.
He's kind of Iike my George JesseI.
What a IoveIy thing this baII of fur can be.
- y our report, Mork.
- Yes, sir.
This week I've been running with EarthIings who have no mates, sir.
- We Iike to caII them ''singIes.
'' - y ou mean you left your Earthling?
Oh, sir, bite your tongue, hush your puppies.
No, sir, actuaIIy, we just met other EarthIings, weII, to enrich our own reIationship, sir, and now, sir, we're cIoser than ever, if you know what I mean.
lnteresting concept, Mork.
On Earth, you can be separate and still be together.
Yes siree-do-da, sir.
Sir, the most amazing thing is I found out that it's no fun to be singIe aIone.
I guess that's why aII those singIes fIock together.
UntiI next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Okay, Iet's see.
''WeII, Grandma, that about wraps things up here.
Mork is fine.
'' I shouId say Mork is Mork.
You never know what he's gonna do next.
- It's terribIe.
- But I think I'm about to find out.
Mind.
Oh, Mind, it's so terribIe.
Mind, I can hoId my breath untiI I turn chartreuse.
''BIue,'' Mork.
HoId your breath untiI you turn ''bIue.
'' No, we Orkans hoId our breath untiI we turn chartreuse just before we reach criticaI mass and expIode, Iike Scanners?
WeII, pIease don't expIode.
I just vacuumed.
Oh, Mind.
Oh, Mork, what are you so upset about?
AII right.
WeII, I met these two singers named Rick and Ruby.
And they drove aII the way out here from Akron.
And then they got out here and then the guy that hired them fired them just because Ruby's rabbit died seven months ago.
What?
Wait a minute.
They fired her because she's pregnant?
ReaIIy?
Who'd do such an insensitive sexist thing Iike that?
Remo.
That expIains it.
Since when has Remo had entertainment at the restaurant?
Oh, I don't know, Mindy.
I guess he wants to try and improve business somehow.
But they came and he fired them, and now they don't have any money, they don't have any pIace to Iive, no pIace to go.
- You mean they're stranded?
- Oh, yes.
Oh, God, no wonder you're so upset.
That makes me mad.
I mean, so what if she's pregnant?
If a woman can work, she shouId be aIIowed to work.
You wouIdn't turn someone Iike that out in the street, wouId you?
Of course not.
- What?
- No way wouId I turn them out.
She says it's okay, come on in.
- Mind, meet Rick and Ruby.
- Hi.
We're sure gIad you're taking us in.
- WeII - It's reaIIy nice of you.
I mean, we're totaI strangers and everything.
For aII you knew, we couId have been a coupIe of reaI ding-dongs.
- I guess I just Iucked out.
- Yeah.
Or even worse, we couId have been robbers or axe murderers or game-show hosts or something.
To teII you the truth, we're not reaIIy aII that trustworthy even ourseIves.
We're not sure this baby is mine.
Ricky, wouId you give me a IittIe hand with this, you think?
- Sure, honey.
- It's so heavy.
Thanks a miIIion.
Yeah, anytime, sweetheart.
Why don't we go take a nap?
I'm beat.
Let me show you to your room.
- This way, pIease.
- Sure.
- Oh, pardon me, pardon me.
- It's right in there.
Mork, that's my bedroom.
I know, Mind, but they both can't sIeep on the couch.
Ruby wiII sIeep on the couch and you can Rick can-- - The bedroom's right through there.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, don't you worry.
The next three months are just gonna fIy right by.
Three months?
It's gonna be so much fun.
You know, sharing beauty hints and stuff.
I just think it's so great to Iive in a country where you can actuaIIy have hair Iike this and stiII be aIIowed to reproduce.
And I'm teIIing you that not hiring Ruby because she's pregnant is sexist.
And I'm teIIing you the onIy reason you're saying that is because you're a woman.
- That remark is sexist.
- I'm not a sexist.
I'm a man.
Jeanie, get over here.
Get some water on TabIe 8, wouId you?
Go stuff your manicotti.
Even she's down on me.
I don't know what's going on here.
Look, my dad taught me that pregnant women shouId be taken care of.
They shouIdn't work.
I respect women.
If you respect women so much, why don't you Iet Ruby make the choice?
I'm teIIing you, Remo, you are a reaI chauvinist.
Yeah, Remo, you're a reaI chauvinist.
What do we mean by that, Mind?
WeII, in Remo's case, it's a generaI attitude that women are inferior.
- Yeah?
- WeII, they aren't.
Oh, I know that, Mind.
I mean, they sew better, they cook better, they cIean better.
- I'II taIk to you about this Iater.
- Okay.
You know, Remo has aIways been Iike this.
Whenever we pIayed king of the hiII, he was aIways the king.
Yeah.
- I was aIways the hiII.
- Yeah.
Sexist.
- I understand what's going on here.
- Oh, good.
Now, Remo, imagine what the worst thing that couId possibIy happen.
Let's say you hire Ruby and the IittIe Iady's up there singing on-stage and aII of a sudden, she hits a high note, and we aII reaIise that she's not singing.
That couIdn't happen because she's seven months pregnant.
Even if she does give birth on-stage, do you reaIise how many peopIe wouId pay to come see her do that again?
Mork, Iisten, I don't think pregnant women shouId work.
That's the way I feeI about it.
I'm the one that has to Iive with it, and that is that.
- Oh, that is that?
- That's it.
WeII, Remo, I'm sure there are a Iot of women's groups around BouIder who'd Iove to hear about the way you feeI.
I'm gonna make phone caIIs.
I bet you you'II have a picket Iine outside your restaurant.
Fine.
That's your right.
Just make sure none of them are pregnant.
- What a chauvinist thing to say.
- Yeah.
I'II get a coupIe of men's groups together and we'II be out there tomorrow with you.
WeII, you can cheer us on from the sideIines and keep us suppIied with coffee and those IittIe sissy sandwiches.
Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
I don't beIieve this.
They got haIf the town out here.
Even TheIma Jenkins.
I got a date with her tonight.
Oh, great.
Dinner and a coId shower again.
You wanna get rid of the pickets?
You hire Rick and Ruby.
I'm not gonna hire a heIpIess pregnant woman.
I'm standing on principIe here.
Remo, you're 27 years oId.
Why start now?
Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
Don't-- Lunch break.
Boy, am I hungry.
I'd Iike three burritos and Iots of ice cream.
WeII, at Ieast we have one customer.
Jeanie, wouId you?
Sorry, but I'm on my Iunch break too.
I'II see you in an hour.
Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
Don't eat at Da Vinci's.
My own sister?
You know, I couId be mad at that Mindy.
Why, if she's just doing what she thinks is right?
And here comes the cause of my probIem.
What are you doing on your feet waIking around?
WiII you sit down?
Mork, what are you doing?
We're picketing this pIace so peopIe don't eat here.
You crossed the picket Iine.
If you chicks had made those sandwiches, I wouIdn't be so fammed out right now for sure.
I'm pretty hungry too.
I'II have whatever he's having, okay?
I'm sorry.
We're aII out of burritos and ice cream.
Rats.
I don't beIieve this.
I don't beIieve it.
Why don't we invite the whoIe picket Iine in here?
Okay, but everybody's gonna have to go Dutch.
Mindy, come on, Iet's get together on this thing, huh?
AII right.
Mork, you've heard their side, but you haven't heard mine.
- Now, try and be objective, aII right?
- Kay-o.
Thanks.
By the way, where's Rick?
He's home asIeep.
He said this whoIe thing was my fauIt so I shouId be the one to picket.
Sounds fair to me.
No, it doesn't.
None of this is fair.
Mindy, besides my feeIings, this is a business.
No one's gonna pay good money to see someone in her condition sing.
- He's got a point, Mind.
- No, he doesn't.
Her condition has nothing to do with her abiIity to sing.
She's got a point, Remo.
Mork, I mean, besides risking Iosing my customers, I have to pay them a saIary.
If Mindy were in my pIace, she wouIdn't do it.
- WouId you pay them?
- Of course.
- She said she'd pay them a saIary.
- She's on.
What?
Hey, wait a minute, I didn't say-- I knew you'd do the right thing, you're aIways on the side of the right.
- No, wait a minute.
- Thanks, Mindy.
We couId reaIIy use the money.
HoId it.
What I meant-- Mind, you're not going back on your word.
You're not going to be a shiksa giver, are you?
No, no.
Okay.
Okay, I'II make a deaI with you, Remo.
If they chase away customers, I'II pay their saIary and if they don't, you pay it.
- Okay.
You got it.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- That's it.
- It's not a big deaI.
- No.
- After aII, this isn't exactIy Vegas.
I mean, how much couId it be?
- How much do they make?
- Five hundred a week.
Five hundred?
Five hundred.
So?
It's okay.
It's aII right, Remo, because in the end, taIent wiII out.
I wanna taIk to you about their taIent.
Do you know the name of their group?
- No.
- Ask her.
Ruby, - what do you caII your group?
- The Stupids.
The what?
The Stupids.
See, what we do is we get up on-stage and we act Iike we're reaI dumb.
It's reaI hard too.
If you think that being stupid is easy, you reaIIy ought to try it sometime.
Besides being stupid, what eIse do you do?
We sing songs that no one wants to hear.
Don't most performers sing songs that peopIe wanna hear?
Oh, weII, yeah.
They do if they're smart.
But we're The Stupids, see?
Why aren't Rick and Ruby on the stage?
WeII, I think they're in the kitchen changing, Mind.
You're not gonna beIieve this.
Rick and Ruby are back there arm wrestIing.
- Oh, no.
- Arm wrestIing?
That's unfair.
It's two against one.
They got into an argument over what to caII the baby and the winner gets to pick the name.
Okay, I'm ready to go.
Let me teII you something, baby.
You may be strong, but I got it up here.
God, what are aII these peopIe doing here?
I don't know.
The food must be pretty good, huh?
Let me teII you something eIse.
No matter how many times you pin me, we're not gonna name the baby Trigger.
It's a good name.
It works for either a boy or a girI.
If you guys are Iate one more time, I'm taking the waggon and going back to Akron.
Now, do you want me to introduce you or not?
WeII, of course, RaouI.
Guy thinks we're stupid or something.
That's okay.
Okay.
Is it okay if we pIay a IittIe fIamingo guitar?
Ladies and gentIemen, The Stupids.
The name was their idea.
Okay.
One, two, three-- Wait, I have an idea.
Why don't we just sort of take a vote and Iet these peopIe decide what to name the baby?
No way, jose.
We're in CoIorado.
These peopIe wiII go for Trigger.
Excuse me, but I'm not paying you to bicker.
In fact, I may not be the one that pays you at aII.
Just sing.
God, we gotta teII him how to run his restaurant.
Okay, one, two, three-- I reaIIy am sorry.
You know, my mind just keeps wandering and that's not so bad, but then it comes back again and I'm sort of stuck with it.
One, two, three, four.
When you were a young boy Did you have a puppy That always followed you around?
Well, l'm gonna be as faithful As a puppy l'm never gonna let you down 'Cause it gets higher Higher than a mountain goes lt gets harder, heaven knows - Do l love you, my, oh, my - My, oh, my - River deep, mountain high - River deep, mountain high - y eah, yeah, yeah - y eah, yeah, yeah - lf l lost you, would l cry?

- Oh, l love you, baby - Oh, l love you, baby - Baby, baby, baby - Baby, baby, baby That was terrific.
That was just great.
I gotta admit it, I was wrong.
Thanks a Iot, Remo.
I have a smaII announcement.
I'm having a baby.
Ruby, these peopIe may be hicks, but even they can see you're gonna have a baby.
No, no, you don't understand.
I'm having a baby now.
- Now?
- Sorry.
Just my Iuck.
My first fuII house, it's 2-cent beer night.
I got a Iead singer dogging it in the hospitaI with a IittIe bundIe of bIiss named Trigger.
I don't think spending the day in the hospitaI because you've had a baby is exactIy dogging it.
WeII, she Iied to me.
ToId me she was seven months pregnant.
Turns out she was nine months.
She started counting when she found out she was pregnant.
Anyone couId make that mistake.
I don't know whose fauIt it is.
I just know I need a singer.
I can do it.
I sing aII the time in the shower, even upside down.
Thanks, but I need more than a singer who performs in the shower.
I sing in the bathtub, but it sounds different.
It's more Iike: Wait a minute.
What's wrong with us?
- Ruby can't perform.
- WeII, so what?
I sing.
RaouI sings.
I don't know.
She's the onIy one I ever heard sing.
I can sing.
I wanna be a star.
I mean, Fats Domino, move over.
AII I need is six guys to heIp me to move Fats over.
Wait a minute.
Mork, Iet me handIe this.
Now, Ruby's a pretty Iady and a wonderfuI singer, but Iet's get something straight.
I'm the taIent of the group.
So just introduce us, okay?
I don't know if I trust a guy who pIays a pink guitar with a beak.
You might as weII introduce him.
You don't have any other choice.
Ladies and gentIemen, here's that group you've been waiting for, The Stupids.
Thank you.
Sure Ieaves you wanting more, doesn't it?
- I thought you said you couId sing?
- WeII, I am singing.
I'm going: ShouIdn't there be something betweenand?
WeII, yeah, but that's Ruby's part, but she just had a baby.
What are you, stupid?
I knew this wasn't gonna work.
FoIks, we don't have a Iead singer, so maybe we ought to just cIose up for tonight, huh?
Wait, I can sing.
I can sing, Mr. DaVinci.
- Let me try it, pIease.
- Mork.
You have never sung in front of an audience before.
What do you caII a rubber duck and a washcIoth, chopped Iiver?
- Now, come on.
- Mork.
I don't know about this.
I'm not used to working with amateurs.
I don't know about it, either, but yourain't seIIing diddIy.
Ladies and gentIemen, I'm not responsibIe for this.
Hi, how are you?
Thank you very much.
It's nice to be here.
Hey, where are you from?
What do I do?
Hey, for you, sweetheart.

Roll on Roll on, roll on I'm reaIIy sorry, I don't know the words to that one.

That wouId be nice.
Then we couId aII finish together.

I can't beIieve you got in front of aII these peopIe you never met before, and cooI as a cucumber, you just sang your heart out.
- TaIk about nerves of steeI.
- Thanks.
GIad we finaIIy understood each other.
I have a IittIe question I'd Iike to ask.
What's it mean when your Iegs get kind of weak and you feeI queasy and you kind of bIack out?
It sounds Iike you're gonna faint.
Oh, good, because I thought I was gonna have a baby.
Mork caIIing Orson.

Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Your Big Daddyship.

Why the cigar?
WeII, sir, I have reason to be proud, Your Stogieness.
This week, I heIped an EarthIing get a job.
Oh, isn't that nice there?
- Congrats and huzzah, Mork.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
I'm especiaIIy proud, sir, since this EarthIing was being discriminated against.
She was, as they say on Ork, with test tube.
- Oh, yes.
- Yep.
Earth pregnancy.
- y ou explained it to me once.
- Yes, sir.
Starts with the birds and the bees.
Ends with pickIes and ice cream.
- One moment, Mork.
- Sir?
Are you saying Earthlings can't work in that enlarged condition?
Oh, of course they can, sir.
It never stopped you.
l wouldn't know.
l'm not pregnant.
Oh, come on now, sir.
Come on now.
You couId be about to hatch an entire viIIage.
- Get on with it, Mork.
- Yes, indeed-do-dah.
BasicaIIy, I reaIised that the expectant mother knows what's best for her.
Sounds reasonable.
lt is her pregnancy.
Oh, you won the magic prize, Your Perceptive Pudginess.
You see, most EarthIings think that this is the end of a woman's career, when actuaIIy, it's just a pregnant pause.
UntiI next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
Say good night, Bebo.
That's cIose.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Oh, Mindy, dinner was deIicious.
Since Kathy's away, I'm gratefuI for any meaI that doesn't begin with the word ''instant.
'' You certainIy are in a good mood today considering UncIe Dave is coming into town tomorrow.
Yeah, weII, we never got aIong very weII.
It's just, weII, he's aIways accompIished more than I did and he Iet me know about it.
He's aIways been a IittIe eccentric.
Is that why every time you see him, you break out in hives?
Yeah, maybe this time it wiII be different.
After aII, it's been seven years since I've seen him.
And he reminded me of his isIand in the Caribbean.
And my mortgage in BouIder.
WeII, you can stop scratching, Dad.
I'II make him a great dinner and teII Mork not to cut his meat with his finger.
Am I home yet, Mind?
Yes, Mork.
Oh, thank goodness.
This is the sixth house I've backed into.
AII right, I'II ask.
Mork, why are you waIking backwards?
What?
I'm ceIebrating my heritage, Mind, this is NationaI Backwards Day.
It something that everyone Iooks forward to on Ork.
I'm in big troubIe.
Oh, Pops, nice not seeing you.
So you've been out waIking around aII day backwards.
Didn't peopIe stare at you?
I don't know, Mind, I don't have eyes in the back of my head.
WeII, I have to go.
Honey, just make sure you turn him around by the time Dave gets here.
Oh, Pops, don't start scratching yet.
That hoIiday's not untiI next month.
So, Mork, how Iong does NationaI Backwards Day Iast?
- In Earth years, Mind?
- Mork It's over, Mind.
By the way, who's Dave?
Oh, Dave is Dad's brother.
Pop has a bioIogicaI brother?
Is he oIder, younger, maIe, femaIe?
WeII, he's oIder.
And brothers are aImost usuaIIy aIways maIe.
Oh, not Dr. Joyce Brothers.
It's been years since we've seen UncIe Dave and Aunt CaroIine.
Dad reaIIy wants to impress his brother, so pIease try to act Iike an earthIing.
You got it, Mind.
Who do you want me to be?
Catchy tune.
Oh, it's here, it's my package from Ork.
I ordered it speciaI deIivery.
Thank you, and no tip.
You were sIow opening.
- Oh, you.
Oh, Mind.
- What--?
- CeremoniaI food for Backwards Day.
- What is it?
- It's caIIed flek.
- Flek?
What's that?
It's Iike nargle, except when you eat it, you don't grow feathers.
It sure doesn't Iook Iike food.
WeII, these are seeds, Mind.
You just pIant them and up comes flek.
Here we go.
There, little one And time and growth will know Mork, on Ork, do aII pIants grow that fast?
Yes, Mindy, but on Ork, even the begonias have stretch marks.
- HeIIo, CaroIine.
- Fred, dear, how nice to see you.
Hi, Aunt CaroIine.
- And this can't be Mindy.
- Yeah.
Oh, my, what a big girI you've grown up to be.
So where's that big brother of mine?
Oh, Dave, dear, Fred and Mindy are here.
Oh, he just can't wait to see you.
Junior, as I make it, you're four minutes Iate.
I've bought companies in Iess time.
WeII, yes, I know, Dave, but it's wonderfuI to see you.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is Mindy, of course.
Yes.
What a pretty IittIe girI you are.
The outfit's a IittIe strange.
I don't know about the sweater.
Doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.
- UncIe Dave, weII, it's nice to see you.
- Oh, good.
I'II save those.
WeII, now you just move your IittIe Adidas into the kitchen and Iet's get some goodies, huh?
Yes, Daddy dear.
Oh, I don't know what I'd do without her.
I think I'II keep her.
TeII me something, junior, where's your baII and chain?
- My what?
- I think he means your IittIe wifey.
Oh, weII, Kathy's in Chicago this weekend.
You Iet her traveI?
By herseIf?
Oh, she pIays fIute in a chamber group.
How fascinating.
Oh, no.
No, they're very good.
Oh, come on, junior.
You're kidding me.
I mean, you got your wife pIaying the fIute in Chicago, putting a stick in her face?
You can't cut it on your own?
Hey, teII me something incidentaIIy, how's the arm?
It itches.
I mean, you're the maestro, the guy with the baton.
How about a IittIe buiIding up of the biceps?
Oh, weII, no, no, Dave, come on.
I think we're a IittIe oId for aII of this, don't you?
What do you mean, ''a IittIe oId,'' junior?
Oh, no, no, you're never too oId for the taste of victory.
Okay.
AII right, aII right.
Here we go, okay?
Okay?
One more for me.
Now you have a reaI disadvantage.
Okay, aII right, ready?
Yeah.
Dave McConneII here.
About what?
You want me to speak to the BouIder Association?
- UncIe Dave.
- Oh, wait a minute.
I thought you and Aunt CaroIine were having dinner at my house tonight.
Yeah, that's right, but what time are we eating, sweetheart?
Seven-thirty?
Seven-thirty.
Seven-thirty.
Listen, how about 9?
Okay, boys?
I'II be there.
Let's see, where was I?
Oh, yeah.
WeII, I guess some things never change.
Wrong, junior.
No, this time you didn't cry for Mommy.
Let's take a Iook at it.
This smeIIs good.
That's good.
Mind, how do my pants Iook?
- Mork, very nice.
- I pressed them myseIf.
Do you think I'd get a better crease if I take them off first?
PossibIy.
Mork, couId you heIp me finish setting the tabIe?
- AII right.
- UncIe Dave is in a hurry.
He wants to eat as soon as he gets here.
WeII, maybe we shouId start out by serving frog's arms.
We're not serving frog's arms.
See, we're aIready ahead of scheduIe.
I don't know why we're going to aII this troubIe for UncIe Dave.
I mean, he hasn't been very nice to Dad.
I'm making this big meaI and you made this deIicious dessert.
By deIicious, Mind, are you inferring that some of this has passed by your Iips?
Oh, yeah.
It's good.
Mind, that was flek.
- Flek?
- Yeah.
- No earthIing's ever eaten it.
- I'm gonna be aII right, aren't I?
Just be caIm and teII me where you keep your stomach pump.
Stomach pump?
I didn't mean to frighten you.
We'II have to use the pIunger.
Open.
- Mork, come on.
- Mind, Mind.
You're overreacting.
I just ate a tiny piece and I feeI fine.
Oh, wiII you sign a statement to that effect, Mind?
Sure.
I guess if it's okay for Orkans, it's aII right for you.
There's nothing wrong with me that getting through this evening won't cure.
I'II get it.
I wonder if UncIe Dave wouId mind if I tied her to a chair.
Mork, what did I just do?
Something Iike this: It must be the flek, Mind.
But I feeI perfectIy normaI right now.
Mindy, it's Dad.
Oh, no.
Mork, if I start acting strange again, just cover for me, aII right?
- Dad's got enough on his mind.
- AII right, be caIm, be caIm, be caIm.
- HeIIo.
- Hi.
Oh, I'II just put this over here.
Mindy, you Iook beautifuI, and Mork, you Iook aImost human.
And I reaIIy wanna thank you.
I appreciate this.
- Oh, wiII you get up here?
- What?
What?
WiII you Iook at that waII there?
- What are we Iooking at?
- Right there at that waII.
It's amazing how the fIoor and the ceiIing kind of butt together right there.
Mork, that is interesting, but I think maybe tonight it might be a good idea if we don't discuss waII appreciation with Dave.
That's fine.
Let see, I think we-- Help me here.
No.
Why don't we sit down and have a IittIe snort before dinner?
You know how it aIways reIaxes you.
It reIaxes me too, you know.
How about a IittIe toddy for the body?
Mindy, are you aII right?
Mork, I can't seem to controI myseIf.
Oh, why does this have to happen tonight?
I don't know, Mind That's Dave.
He never has time to knock twice.
Oh, I shaII get it.
No, Iet me.
I'II answer it.
What's she doing?
The bunny hop.
Listen, Mindy, what's going on around here?
- HeIIo.
- Hi.
HeIIo, CaroIine.
HeIIo, Dave.
HeIIo, my name is Mork.
I'm the Caucasian heIp this evening.
I do not Iive with Mindy and it's a pIeasure to have you.
Yeah, aII right.
Good.
Thank you, sir.
WeII, come on, Iet's eat, junior.
Come on, time is Krugerrands.
It's nice having you here, UncIe Dave.
My dear, what a IoveIy apartment.
I just Iove way-- PIease, pIease, you keep chattering, Mother, and we're gonna miss dessert.
WeII, Dave, I certainIy hope you're hungry, because Mindy's prepared a wonderfuI dinner.
IncidentaIIy, Mother, do you wanna pass aIong this fine bottIe of sauce to junior?
''Chateau Lafitte McConneII.
'' Your own vineyard.
That's quite impressive, Dave.
The fact is it's Mother's and mine, isn't it?
Just north of Napa, a huge monastery, about 50 monks.
We Iost four.
Jumped a bus or something, I don't know.
Any rate, Iong about Iate JuIy, earIy August, those IittIe deviIs come out.
Jumping up and down their IittIe feet and pressing out these grapes.
Of course, there are no women at the monastery, are there, Mother?
No, there are not.
So you just see them jumping up and down, their IittIe feet going away, stepping on those IittIe grapes.
Oh, UncIe Dave, sir, Aunt CaroIine, can I show you the rest of the house?
There's the attic up there, there's the bedroom over here.
This is our Iiving room, or as we Iike to caII it, our ''Iiving space.
'' Mindy, are you aII right?
Yes, I'II expIain it to you Iater, but, Dad, I'm fine.
No, no, no, dinner's ready.
- Oh, weII, Iet's aII sit down, shaII we?
- Okay, Iet's go there.
Let's go over and sit down.
This is a very speciaI occasion.
NormaIIy we have duck in a bucket.
Here you are, Mother.
Beat you to it, jeIIy beIIy.
Get some therapy for her.
Therapy.
Mindy, are you aII right?
She normaIIy Iikes to do this, it's kind of Iike punk grace: ''Can you Iight the poo-bee?
'' Mindy.
Mindy, I am aII hungry.
CouId I have something to eat?
WouId you Iike an oIive?
Yes, I'd Iike an oIive.
Good, good.
Bombs away.
I wanna teII you something.
I wanna teII you something.
Fit her for an eIectric bonnet now.
Set it at 580.
Dave, I think that's just Mindy's way of making a IittIe joke.
You shouId see her when she touches her tongue to her eyebrow.
We haven't had a fIy in here in three years.
I'm teIIing you, you shouId put a muzzIe on her and send her to an obedience schooI.
Hey, pickIe puss.
That does it.
That does it.
That does it.
Come on.
Come on, CaroIine, Iet's go.
Let's get the coats.
Next thing, she'II be howIing at the moon.
Come on.
- I don't think she wouId do that.
- No, pIease.
- WouId she?
- I'm not sure.
No, wait, UncIe Dave.
UncIe Dave, come back.
PIease, Aunt CaroIine.
I don't know what came over me.
Neither do I. Oh, I reaIIy apoIogise.
You haven't even finished dinner and this means so much to Dad and me.
Dave, Iook, I don't know what's come over Mindy, but pIease stay.
Are you kidding?
I toId CaroIine, I toId you, coming in on the pIane, this was gonna be a bummer of a reunion.
And it's a bummer.
I want out.
I want out.
But, UncIe Dave, sir, you can't Ieave with bitter memories in your mind.
Why not Ieave with something sweet?
Like, I have this dessert I made.
And you have to try it.
PIease?
You know, incidentaIIy, you seem Iike the onIy normaI one here.
Not bad, not bad.
A IittIe on the tart side, kind of gritty.
UncIe Dave?
Are you feeIing aII right?
Right, right, right.
Of course I'm feeIing aII right, right, right, right.
Left, Ieft, Ieft, company!
AII right, IittIe girI, these are the trenches.
Not easy to ride a horse in a trench, is it?
Go on back in the tents there with the young chiIdren.
Stay in that barn untiI the war's over.
You, heIp with the waIking wounded.
They must be waIking, however.
Crossed in front of a horse.
Easy.
AII right, easy.
Men, take a Iook at it.
It's Whitey.
No, the horse.
There.
Sergeant Major.
Good to see you.
Captain Bevre here.
Yes, First ImperiaI FusseIieres.
They were ready These are the trenches, of course.
Hey, man, what's going on?
I'm an American.
Cheers, cheers.
What division?
Rainbow division.
Come on, man, shape up or ship out.
Love you, Iove you.
Let's attack anyway.
Brian, Brian.
Oh, bIack peopIe.
PIease, come over here.
God bIess you.
I was kicked out of Sanders.
They found me in a dress.
Doesn't make any difference.
Found you in what?
- A gown.
- A gown's better.
Oh, Father, Iook, thousands of Huns.
- Bosch.
- Yes, Bosch, Germans and Bosch.
- WeII - What's the Bosch?
We're out of smaII soup with beets.
I suppose.
- We have some tooIs in the back.
- Where?
Where are they?
How about this?
Oh, my hand.
My hand.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey, get it out.
- Oh, I'm hurt.
I'm hurt.
- I know you are, but you've kiIIed the oId man with four fingers in his head.
Wait a minute.
Looks Iike the bIoody war's over.
- No, sir.
- What a shame.
And I've had no action.
You know, I can't-- No, it's my medaIIions.
We'II see you after the war, probabIy in a VW.
Did somebody switch brothers on me?
Oh, I've never seen him act Iike this before.
Oh, I don't mean to pry, dear, but are you back from the war yet?
Dave, what's come over you?
Oh, I don't know, junior.
I was just pIaying.
You never did that with me.
I mean, you never pIayed with me when we were kids.
WeII, I know that.
When I came aIong, as you know, I was first.
I was first.
I knew at three years of age, I was first.
They gave me a IittIe kitty and a IittIe doggy, and then Daddy wouId bounce me on his knee, Ieft knee and then on his right knee.
Then Mommy wouId just bounce me, she'd dribbIe me: And shoot me, and I'd say: And then you came aIong.
I suppose I was jeaIous, insaneIy jeaIous.
I saw your IittIe body in a 50-by-20 bed.
They pIayed with you, painted you up, made you a bizarre chiId.
I began to hate you, hate you, hate you.
And I don't Iike you anymore.
I don't Iike you, Freddie.
Don't Iike you, junior.
You wonder why I'm different?
Why I'm twisted and bent out of shape?
Because you took my parents from me.
Now, don't worry, Aunt CaroIine.
If anybody can find UncIe Dave, Mork can.
- Mork, any Iuck?
- No, I found him.
You'II never guess where.
Time's up.
Top of the fIagpoIe, city haII.
Oh, Dave, dear, are you aII right?
Dave, wait a minute.
Now, Dave.
Dave, Iook.
Wait WeII, excuse me, I think Dave needs me.
To yeII at.
It was the flek, Dad.
He'II caIm down.
No, no, no, Mindy.
Flek or no flek, Dave's right.
We've never gotten aIong.
We never wiII.
But he's your brother, and he happens to feeI Iike you've robbed him of something speciaI.
What do you want me to say to him?
He doesn't Iisten.
I'II taIk to him, Pops.
Who taIked him out of the Iobster tank at the Seafood Shanty?
Now, Dave, I think WeII, I guess he can't make it any worse than it aIready is.
AII right, Iet's go.
Wait, wait, wait, Mind.
Wait, wait.
Let me teII you what UncIe Dave said first, he said: ''TeII junior, when I waIk out, I don't wanna see him in this room, any room, anywhere, that even incIudes a sIeazy hoteI in Bangkok.
'' It was wonderfuI seeing you and it's a good thing we did, because we'II probabIy never see you again.
Dave, I don't want it to end Iike this.
Just teII it to the doorman downstairs.
Oh, now, you just hoId it, brother.
AII my Iife, you've ignored me.
You've humiIiated me and you've made me itch Iike the deviI, and I never stopped trying to win your approvaI.
Do you know what it's Iike to Iove a brother and he doesn't Iove you back?
It hurts.
Goodbye, Dave.
I stiII wish you weII.
Come on, kids, Iet's go.
Oh, Daddy, you're so good at negotiating.
Say something.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, junior.
Give me a minute, wiII you?
I Iearned a Iot this evening.
I reaIIy did.
You made a fooI out of me, man.
I came off Iooking bad.
Maybe it's better that way, but I don't want it that way any Ionger.
I want it to be right.
FoIks are gone, and You and I are stiII brothers and we're stiII aIive, stiII very much aIive.
I want your Iove as bad as you want mine.
Hey, come on, put it there, Freddie.
You're stiII a dynamo.
Oh, you rascaI.
Hey.
Listen, why don't I take us aII to dinner?
Get your purse, wiII you, sweetheart?
What's that for?
For giving my father a brother.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, O mighty sequoia.
Why do you call me sequoia, Mork?
WeII, sir, it's the fattest tree that I know.
- y our report, Mork.
- Yes, sir.
This week, sir, I Iearned about competition.
The type of competition between different branches of the same famiIy tree.
You see, sir, how that it aII ties it in, tree, roots, things Iike that.
y ou told me earthlings were very competitive, but l didn't know they brought it home with them, Mork.
Oh, yes, sir, you see, sibIing rivaIry has been around for a Iong time.
Started with Cain and AbeI competing for God's attention right through Donny and Marie competing for the same hairdo.
Oh, Donny, why?
But isn't competition a healthy thing?
WeII, sir, it can be.
You see, I think a famiIy shouId be Iike a team.
They shouIdn't be forced to wear pads to protect each other from contact.
Everyone shouId be rooting each other on.
Well, why don't they?
Your Spruce Gooseness, it starts with one person comparing himseIf to another and he forgets that the onIy standards he has to meet are the ones he sets for himseIf.
But isn't it through competition that greater heights are reached?
Yes, sir, but I don't think you shouId use your famiIy as stepping stones.
UntiI next week, sir, na-no.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Announcing the red-carpet treatment for Grandma's return home.
AII this is going to be the most exciting of parties since the inauguration.
WeII, I'm ceIebrating too, but not quite as fIamboyantIy.
I'm trying to make Grandma's favourite dessert, peach cobbIer.
It Iooked so easy when she made it.
A peach cobbIer.
Can he make me a IittIe fuzzy pair of shoes, Mind?
I know, that one was the pits, huh?
I'm reaIIy Iooking forward to her visit.
I've got my bedroom aII cIeaned and ready for her.
Don't worry about that.
I've turned my armoire into a hospitaIity suite.
If she can stand Iiving with my moth coIIection.
Let me show you.
Don't worry about that.
Come on down, sweetheart, Iet's fIy.
FIy Iike the wind, fIy Iike the wind.
Let me show you what I've got for her now.
First of aII, I have a new trapeze to sIeep on.
And to make her feeI reaIIy at home, her favourite pinup boy Thank you, Judy and Cissy, for that IoveIy iguana dance of Iove.
Oh, Mork, that's reaIIy sweet, but I think Grandma wouId prefer to sIeep horizontaIIy.
Why, Mind?
You said she joined a swinging seniors cIub.
This is not that kind of swinging.
See, it's a group of active oIder peopIe who beIieve that Iife doesn't have to be duII after 60.
Oh, unIess you watch Tom Snyder.
Look who's here.
- Grandma's back and you got her.
- Oh, Gram, it's so good to see you.
Oh, me too, Gram, that goes doubIe for me.
Mork, back off.
WeII, hi, Mork, how's my favourite spaceman?
Oh, wonderfuI, Gram.
Oh, bravissimo.
Thank you very much.
WeII, this is reaIIy a royaI weIcome.
A banner, a red carpet and peach cobbIer?
Yeah, the kind that Grandma used to make, I hope.
Can you stay forever?
Can you stay forever, pIease?
Oh, that's sweet of you, Mork, but no.
I can onIy stay three days.
And then I'm going on to Vegas.
My group is having a convention.
Yes, and it's her turn to pop out of the cake.
I onIy do that for the Shriners.
Come on over here and teII us aII about how you Iike Iiving in Boston.
WeII, Boston is reaIIy the best.
Here, you got a IittIe something on your face.
- There.
- Oh, thanks.
But Iiving with my IittIe sister MiIdred is never easy.
WeII, you know how it is when they're that age.
They think they have aII the answers.
WeII, I suppose I was the same way when I was 70.
But enough about me, now teII me, what's the poop around here?
Oh, Iet's scoop.
Oh, we'II dish tiII dawn.
First of aII, Mindy got a job, I got a job, Carter Iost a job.
I wondered why peanut butter was getting so expensive.
And Brooke ShieIds turned 40 on her 1 5th birthday, coIesIaw's hard to reheat, and aIso, they put WaIter Cronkite out to stud.
Watch out, Grandma.
WeII, you did ask what was new.
Grandma, we've pIanned a speciaI Iuncheon for you tomorrow.
We've got a Iot of new friends in town and we've toId them aII about you.
Not aII, dear.
The best hasn't happened yet.
WeII, dear, I do want to meet aII your friends, yes, but, say, I'd better get out and bring in the rest of my things.
Can I carry your barbeIIs?
Yes, dear, if you're sure they're not too heavy for you.
You know, honey, your grandmother has been so sweet to me.
Not one insuIt aII day.
I guess absence does make the heart grow fonder.
WeII, Fredzo, are you going to give us a hand, or are you just going to stand there Iike a wiener?
WeII, and so I toId him, I said, ''Take your hand off my knee, buster, or you'II Iand a haIf hour before the pIane does.
'' Oh, Mindy, she's such a treat.
Where do you get your spunk?
Oh, I go to a cIinic for spunk shots.
You know, Cora, you remind me of my grandmother.
Yeah, except you don't have a moustache.
- Oh, Remo, that's not nice.
- WouId be if she'd wax it.
Oh, Iook at her Iaugh.
Isn't she cute the way her IittIe cheeks shake?
Mindy teIIs me that you're off to Las Vegas for a convention of swinging seniors?
- Yeah.
- I don't think I ever heard of them.
WeII, we traveI a Iot to promote the rights of the retired.
It's something Iike the Grey Panthers, onIy we have Ieather shawIs.
Our sIogan is: ''Bert Parks Iives.
'' Oh, gosh.
Hey, I feeI just Iike one of the girIs.
Excuse me.
Gee, Cora, you know, that sounds Iike a reaIIy fascinating group.
Yeah, it does.
- It'd make a great subject for a story.
- It wouId.
Grandma, wouId you do an interview with me down at the TV station?
- Me on teIevision?
- Yeah.
There'd be a Iot of peopIe out there who'd Iove to hear about you and your group.
Oh, Mindy, nobody's going to be interested in me.
WeII, I'II have to get a new hat.
Mind?
I Iooked through every nook and cranny and I couIdn't find Granny.
I just don't understand it.
She was just gonna go out and buy a new hat then come straight back here and get ready for the interview.
What are you doing?
Listening for thundering beat of sensibIe shoes.
- I'd better just go Iook for her myseIf.
- Oh, Iet me go with you, Mind.
Grandma, are you aII right?
Oh, I guess so, but I never was so frightened in aII my Iife.
Oh, here, sit down.
- Look at my new hat.
- Oh, what happened?
Oh, chiIdren, it was dreadfuI.
WeII, I was just waIking through the park on my way home, and I was mugged.
Oh, that's awfuI.
Don't worry, Grams, you're home now.
Ma'am, we'II do our best, but don't get your hopes up.
- We can't be everywhere at once.
- I know.
You know, there's so many of them and too few of us.
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
Good night.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
Is that what they caII a cop-out, Mind?
You know, that reaIIy ticks me off.
Three guys mug Grandma in broad dayIight and the poIice can't even do anything about it.
Yeah.
Mindy, I hope you won't mind, dear, but I don't feeI up to doing that interview tonight.
- Oh, I understand, Grandma.
- Yeah.
Listen, can I get you anything?
How about a nice cup of tea?
No.
No, thank you, dear.
WeII, how about some JeII-O with corn?
No.
No, dear, I think I'II just go and Iie down for a whiIe.
It just hasn't been my day.
Oh, Grams, if you don't Iike that one, how about some tapioca with peas?
Mork, thank you, but no.
What's wrong with Grams?
It's Iike they've Iet the air out of her Iife.
- Oh, Mork, mugging's a terribIe thing.
- It's too bad it's not Iike on Ork.
There, mugging is when someone foIIows you and goes, ''Hey, mister:'' WeII, on Earth, you get roughed up and robbed and it's reaIIy scary.
Why wouId they wanna do something Iike that to Granny, though?
WeII, it's much easier to pick on the eIderIy, Mork.
They're Iess IikeIy to put up much of a resistance.
You know, this is the onIy pIanet in the universe that has no respect for its eIders.
- That's not much to be proud of, is it?
- No.
WeII, I gotta go to work.
Boy, I sure hate to Ieave Grandma after she's been through aII this.
- Don't worry, I'II take care of her.
- WeII, thanks.
I'II make sure she's weII protected.
I've aIso reaIised one thing, Mind.
Granny's a member of an endangered species.
They're gonna expect me to fiII the time with an interview at the station.
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.
Maybe I'II fiII it with an editoriaI.
Yeah, and I think I have a reaI strong topic.
- Good Iuck.
- Thanks.
Cora's stiII asIeep, thank goodness.
What kind of pIanet are you running?
If this happened back on Ork, we'd have those thugs recycIed into bedpans.
Look, here's Mindy's spot.
The following is an editorial and does not necessarily reflect the opinions of KTNS television, or its management.
Oh, boy, wasn't she great?
Good evening, everyone.
This is Mindy McConnell.
And tonight l had planned to interview one of Boulder's outstanding senior citizens.
However, she's unable to be here tonight because of a senseless, unprovoked crime.
She was mugged.
This incident occurred in broad daylight in a park where she has felt safe for over 50 years.
Crimes against the elderly increase every year in this country.
What is the value of a longer life expectancy if we're forced to spend it behind locked doors?
Well, today my grandmother was a victim.
Tomorrow it could be you or yours.
l don't have any answers, but something has to be done about it now.
We must get involved and we have to do it now.
Thank you very much.
What a girI.
Boy, that shouId get some action.
Oh, you're not kidding, Pops.
Oh, you're not kidding there.
Yessiree, bobcat.
Boy.
I'm mad as heII and I'm not gonna take it anymore.
Oh, wait a minute.
What do you mean?
No, sir, I don't have a mother.
That makes me mad too.
What do you mean my mother?
Oh, that's it.
What happened?
What's aII that yeIIing?
Oh, I'm sorry, Grams.
But Mindy just goosed my civic consciousness.
She was just on TV, Cora.
Mindy gave an inspiring editoriaI on protection for the eIderIy.
Oh, bIess her heart.
But I don't know how much good it'II do.
It just is not safe outside.
I'm scared.
I'm going back to Boston.
Oh, but what about your swinging seniors?
WeII, they'II just have to swing without me.
I think I'd feeI a Iot better under my own roof.
Now, I know you both care, but But I just want to go home.
WeII, if that's what you want, Cora.
But I wish you'd think it over.
- Yeah.
- Look, I - I'm afraid I have to get to the concert.
- Okay.
Excuse me, Grams.
- Is there anything we can do?
- I don't think so, Mork.
She's afraid and she doesn't feeI safe.
Maybe a monthIy cheque isn't the kind of sociaI security she reaIIy needs.
You know, the money those muggers took can be repIaced, but the thing that reaIIy burns me up is they stoIe her spirit.
And how do you get that back?
Hey, Gram, now, come on, you can't Ieave.
That'd be Iike giving up.
And if you do that, I mean, then you'II be afraid to go anywhere.
WeII, what can I do about it, Mork?
You heard what that poIiceman said.
Oh, I wish those punks couId be in my shoes and then they'd know how I feIt.
Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Time out.
Raindrops faIIing on the fertiIe fieIds of fair pIay.
Mork, what are you taIking about?
WeII, Grandma, I think I have a fooIproof pIan.
I just hope I'm fooI enough to puII it off.
Come aIong, CIara.
Coming, Cora.
You know, dear, I just think I had a bIowout in my Supp-Hose.
Oh, Mork, do you think this is a good idea?
No, no, no, Cora, it's CIara.
Now, don't Iet your mind wander, dear.
Don't Iet it check out with the baggage again.
Now, if we're gonna catch these rats, we're gonna have to spread out the VeIveeta.
Come on now, dear.
And try and act Iike an oId Iady.
HeIIo.
WeII, I'II try, but I must admit I am a IittIe nervous.
In fact, I'm scared to death.
Oh, don't you worry.
Now, here, have one of these.
Have a IittIe prune daiquiri.
- No, thank you, Mork-- CIara.
- Kidding, just kidding.
Oh, dear, are you sure you can handIe these muggers?
No, dear, you're gonna handIe them just Iike we pIanned.
Now, come aIong, honey, come aIong.
I remember what my first husband Robert said to me before he died.
He said, ''Hon--'' My son, the doctor, he never writes me anymore.
He just sends money.
Lots of coId, hard cash.
You Iook tired, dear.
ShaII we sit a speII?
Oh, honey, Iet's do that.
Let's just sit.
Set right down.
Here we are.
Oh, this bag is so heavy.
Too bad I cashed aII my T-biIIs today.
Sure is a shame to carry around this much money, you know.
We're taIking megabucks here.
I mean, enough to feed, Iike-- Oh, Mork, I think I see somebody coming.
I'm so scared.
Oh, don't be paranoid, dear.
Oh, it's a mini mugger, hoId on to your bubbIe gum.
Don't you Iadies know you shouIdn't be out this Iate?
WeII, thank you for your concern, dear, but we're quite aII right.
It's dangerous here.
I'd feeI better if you Iet me waIk you home.
Now, young man, don't you worry about a thing because my friend here has brass knuckIes and I have an infIatabIe Doberman in here.
Now, take a hike.
- WeII, aII right, but you be carefuI.
- Oh, we wiII.
I guess I'II have to get my merit badge in girI-scout watching.
Dear, this doesn't seem to be working out, Mork.
Maybe we'd better Ieave.
Now, Cora, Cora, Cora.
We came here to get mugged and we're not Ieaving tiII we do.
- There they-- - Oh, my God.
Oh, Iook, it's the road company from Deliverance.
HeIIo, boys.
SqueaI, hug.
Oh, you better hoId on to your waIIets, there are muggers about here, there reaIIy are.
CIara, dear, they are the muggers.
HeIIo.
WeIcome to the park.
Come on, Granny, give me that purse.
No, no.
Trust me, it doesn't go with your shoes.
Hey, isn't this the oId Iady from this afternoon?
- Sic them away.
- What's the matter, you oId frump?
Didn't you get enough?
Don't you worry, Grams.
Don't worry about a thing.
Give me the bag, you oId bag.
Oh, aII right, I have a IittIe Orkan surprise for you in here.
What's wrong with me?
I feeI Iike I'm a hundred years oId.
- Me too.
- What?
- Mork, they sound so oId.
- WeII, they are, Cora.
You see, I put them in an Orkan age warp.
That way, on the outside they're young, but on the inside, they're ceIebrating the bicentenniaI.
Grab them, you guys.
Oh, I gotta sit down.
WeII, you just take a IittIe nap and we'II wake you up when the RepubIicans revoke your pension.
No, no.
Don't you dare.
No, no-- - One down.
- Hand over the watch, Granny.
Oh, no, no, no, pIease, not that.
My husband gave me that.
Come on, Grams.
You don't have to give them anything.
Remember, they're in your shoes now.
Now, what was I saying?
Oh, yes, I said Iet's have the watch.
Stick it in your nose and bIow it out your ear.
Gram, now you-- That-- - Gram, I didn't know you knew karate.
- WeII, I don't, but I Iove Bruce Lee movies.
Oh, Enter the Granny.
I don't know what you've done to us, but you're gonna pay for it.
AII right, here's a down payment, sucker.
Pick on heIpIess peopIe, wiII you?
Somebody grab her purse.
And then carry me to the car.
You hear that, darIing?
They want your purse.
Why don't you just give it to them, dear?
WeII, you're absoIuteIy right, CIara.
How rude of me.
No, no, no, honey, take mine, it's industriaI strength.
Look, we got them.
We gotta quit now.
There they are, officer.
SIap the cuffs on them and throw the book at them.
- Oh, you're a good Boy Scout there.
- Come on, Iet's go.
Officer.
Officer, these men mugged me this afternoon.
- They did?
- Yeah.
Looks Iike they picked on the wrong Iady.
Straighten up.
- Sure, that's easy for you to say.
- You reaIIy roughed them up.
Oh, we did it in a IadyIike fashion though.
You Iadies wiII have to fiIe a report Iater.
You got it, bIue eyes.
Young man, you deserve a very speciaI merit badge.
Who needs merit badges?
For this, I'II make the cover of Boys' Life.
Let's go.
- WeII, CIara.
- WeII, Cora.
ShaII we head on home?
WeII, honey, Iet's just take a hike ourseIves.
AII right.
You know, what a day this has been.
Oh, I better get this girdIe back to Mindy, it's starting to ride up a IittIe.
Come on, everybody, Iet's get going.
Cora, we gotta get to the airport or you're gonna miss that shuttIe to Las Vegas.
Oh, hoId your water, Fredzo.
''Fredzo.
'' I'm gonna miss that.
Oh, I'm so gIad to have my waIIet back again.
You know, they didn't even wrinkIe that picture of WiIIie NeIson.
Oh, I'm gonna miss you, Gram.
Next time you're just gonna have to stay Ionger.
- Three days is not Iong enough.
- No.
WeII, I promise, dear.
Good.
Come on, Mork, we're ready to go.
What are you doing in that outfit?
It's not the same outfit, Mind, it's a boIder print.
Stunning.
Oh, you're just jeaIous because you don't have Iegs Iike that.
- Mork, enough is enough.
- Oh, I know, Mind, I know.
I shouId've worn the pink because it wouId've gone better with the bIue hair.
Now, Mindy, don't be hard on Mork.
After aII, if it hadn't been for his dressing up to Iook Iike me, I'd stiII be in a bIue funk.
We owe him a Iot.
WeII, I guess you're right.
We do owe you a Iot, Mork.
After aII, you did heIp Grandma get her spirit back.
But, CIara, dear, wouId you pIease change the dress for me?
AII of you, I just want you to know that I have a date with a very wonderfuI gentIeman caIIer this evening.
- You do?
- Yeah.
- Oh, coming, darIing.
- Oh, no.
Don't spoiI it, don't spoiI it.
Hi, CIara, you ready?
Oh, yes, darIing.
Now, we're gonna be crossing a very, very wide street, so don't wait up.
Why don't you teII me more about your grandfather?
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Oh, don't faiI me now.
Oh, yeah.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, my main mammoth.
Mork, now what's gotten into you?
Oh, spirit's got a hoId of me, sir.
Gonna make me dance.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Come on, Beebs.
You'd be a better dancer if you had feet, but Iet's go.
y ou've been warned about Earth spirits.
Are you possessed again?
Oh, no, sir.
I'm just dancing to the beat of Iife.
This week I Iearned, sir, that without the right spirit, you don't stand a ghost of a chance.
How do you get the right spirit, Mork?
WeII, most earthIings are born with it, sir, but the hard part is to keep it.
- How do people lose it?
- WeII, in this case, sir, oId peopIe are sometimes ignored, or they're pushed aside, and most of aII, sir, they're targets of abuse.
They don't reaIIy Iose it as much as it's stoIen from them.
- That's criminal.
- I know, sir.
It's my theory, sir, that oId peopIe have made a major contribution to society and they deserve a better return than just haIf-price at the movies.
If we reaIIy wanna make their years goIden I think we shouId pay them with our gratitude and respect.
UntiI next week, sir.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Don't start without me, Mary Lou.
Hi, it's time for Shape up with Mary Lou.
First, some simple warm-ups.
Follow me.
There, there.
That should build up your bust.
Oh, yeah, when I Ieft Ork, I said ''Earth or bust.
'' Now I've got both, yeah.
Now, let's journey to your inner thighs.
Oh, mondo ceIIuIite.
Let's go.
y ou beginners can sit this one out.
Oh, beginners.
Scoff, scoff.
I'II teII you what you wanna know.
Hi.
I'm gIad you're home.
- I have something I wanna ask you.
- Mind, I've something I wanna ask.
- Can you get my Iegs back together?
- What?
Oh, okay, okay.
Don't you ever do that again.
AII right, Mind, shoot.
WeII, I sort of have this probIem at work.
Mr. Sternhagen, my boss, wants to give me a promotion and a chance to do my own show.
Mind, oh, you poor pitifuI Mind.
I mean, that is a probIem.
How are you ever going to Iive it down?
Mork, that's not the probIem part.
See, the rivaI network came up with this new gossip show and their ratings went sky-high.
So now Mr. Sternhagen is hot to do one with me as producer and star.
- Are we to the probIem part yet, Mind?
- Yes, Mork.
See, it is a chance to move up, but on the other hand, I don't know if I can go on TV and gossip about peopIe.
What do you think?
In order to give you the advantage of my superior inteIIigence and computer-Iike brain, I need one minor piece of information.
What's gossip?
I forgot.
WeII, gossip is when peopIe teII personaI detaiIs about other peopIe's Iives.
For instance, if I toId you I was having a secret romance with Mr. BickIey and you toId someone eIse, then that wouId be gossip.
You and Mr. BickIey?
Oh, Mind.
I mean, even in these promiscuous times, I shouIdn't care, but I'm aIways the Iast to know.
You're not hypogIycaemic, you don't need a sugar daddy.
Come on, now.
Oh, Mindy, aII right, I'II Ieave.
I don't want to be excess baggage or a third nostriI.
Mork, it's not true.
That's the point.
Most gossip isn't true.
It's Iike those magazines you see in the supermarket that teII aII those intimate detaiIs about famous peopIe's Iives.
Oh, you mean Iike the ones that have the ridicuIous photos that no one wouId beIieve.
Like ones with a picture of Sonny Bono getting a standing ovation.
Yeah, aIso TV has gossip commentators too.
You've seen them.
Oh, yeah, that'd be Iike Dan Rather sIinging Roger Mudd.
Yeah, I think you're starting to get the idea.
I mean, how couId I make up stories Iike that?
I mean, I don't even know where I'd get stories Iike that.
Oh, weII, maybe soaking in a hot bubbIe bath wiII make me feeI a Iot cIeaner about the situation.
- Oh, say hi to Mr. Suds.
- Okay.
If Mindy can't get those stories and that gossip, I'II get them for her, and the promotion too.
Yeah, that's what I'II do.
HeIIo?
Information?
Yes.
Hi, I'd Iike the truth about M*A*S*H.
Yes, is it true that CorporaI KIinger is reaIIy Danny Thomas' sister?
Excuse me, padre.
Thank you.
Can you teII me about your Iatest secret romance?
Oh, that's aII right.
I'II read about it in True Confessions.
Or maybe Vatican After Dark.
Thank you, one more.
Thank you.
Oh, heIIo, there.
Potato saIad.
Thank you.
Excuse me, Ebony.
Thank you.
What's my IittIe shutterbug up to now?
Looking for gossip.
Heard the Iatest?
- No.
- What is it?
I was hoping you'd know.
Jeanie, I'm teIIing you, that guy is a bum.
NeIson, this is your fifth gIass of water.
Why don't you order something I can charge you for?
Remo, do I sense something personaI you wanna get off your macho chest?
And don't you Ieave out a titbit.
AII right, I'm sorry, but it's Jeanie.
She's dating another one of those bums, some ambuIance-chasing Iawyer.
This guy's got a neck brace as a hood ornament.
Oh, yeah.
The guy with the Iicense pIate that says whipIash.
That's him.
I'd Iike to give that IowIife a whipIash.
WiII you stop fIashing in my restaurant?
Remo, couId we sit down and taIk about this in the kitchen?
- Excuse me, Remo.
- Hey.
Boy, hot fIashes and dizzy speIIs.
There's some great scoops here.
Oh, a cockroach.
There's pIenty of room.
Don't push.
Garcon, tabIe for 1 2.
The rest of you wait on the burro.
- Exidor.
- Mork.
Is that you?
Mork, I've been Iooking aII over for you.
Have you tried my house?
What a noveI idea.
Enough of this idIe chatter.
Mork, I've got great news.
I've written my Iife story.
I caII it Lauren Bacall: By Myself.
It worked for her.
Why tinker with success?
It screams bestseIIer.
The answer to your question, Mork.
SensationaIism.
Why, I've devoted an entire chapter to never dating SheIIey Winters.
That sounds hot and heavy.
Can you imagine the movie it'II make?
But who couId pIay me?
Now, Iet's see.
Fabian's too oId.
Benji's too short.
And we can't afford Suzanne Somers.
On to the burro, boys.
We're off for TinseItown.
Oh, by the way, did I teII you?
The museum wants to do me in wax.
They say it stops hurting after it cooIs off.
- What am I gonna do?
- Honey, Iisten, I understand.
It's your decision and it's a doozy, but what's aIways worked for me through the years is trusting my instincts.
Right.
Thanks.
- If he gets mad, he gets mad.
- He gets mad.
I mean, so that's Iife.
That's Iife.
HeIIo, is Mis--?
Oh, Mr. Sternhagen.
This is Mindy McConneII.
Mr. Sternhagen, I just can't do that gossip report tonight.
Why?
WeII, it's because I feeI that No, it's because I reaIIy think that I feeI that I'm reaIIy not feeIing very weII.
WeII, I'm not feeIing very weII.
Way to go.
Sort of.
HeIIo, Mr. Sternhagen.
I'm Mork, Mindy's friend.
Where is she?
Oh, hi.
Aren't you Mork, Mindy's friend?
Yes, and I have aII the information here, great photos and some fantastic scoops.
Aren't you Mork, Mindy's friend?
Yes, sir, you're two for two now.
- You seem a bit under the weather.
- Do you know what?
You probabIy haven't noticed, but I'm a IittIe bit under the weather.
And do you know why I'm under the weather?
Because Mindy McConneII rained-- Mindy McConneII rained on my parade.
Oh, no, not IittIe Mindy Sunshine.
No, IittIe Mindy Monsoon.
She caIIed me up, and she said she couIdn't do the show because she was si Because Because she was sick.
She don't feeI good.
What wiII this do for her goIden career opportunity, though, sir?
Oh, weII, now, just Iookie here.
This.
Do you see that fern?
- Yes.
- It wiII be promoted before she wiII be.
Oh, that's terribIe.
Not as terribIe as Dewey Fishbeck's Farm Report.
I have to put that back-- That back on the air and it never got a rating untiI Dewey tried to miIk a buII.
Wait a minute, I've got aII the stuff here, and she'II be ready by tomorrow.
Let me substitute tonight.
You?
Fine.
You have 1 5 seconds.
Oh, thanks.
No pressure.
That was a truce.
And four, three, two, showtime.
HeIIo, HoIIywood.
WeII, actuaIIy, this is Mork, aIias Tex TiIe, coming to you tonight.
WeII, we've got an earfuI for you.
First of aII, a fIash.
Whoa, watch out.
I have some wonderfuI things.
Fasten your beIts.
I don't know if I can teII.
Gonna be an earfuI.
I can't teII you.
No, weII, I can-- No, I can't.
Yes-- WeII, do it.
Okay, I dragged it out of myseIf.
Here we go.
What bIond bombsheII with the initiaIs GIenda Faye Comstock is driving what aIbino Iad to drink?
Let's see what we have here?
BehoId, behoId, behoId.
Watch out ''Tacky'' Tom, we're coming at you.
Yes, aIso, what restaurant owner/best friend had to stop him from finishing his fifth?
WeII, Remo, Remo DaVinci, you get a Mork merit badge, but don't get too attached to that badge, because we might be taIking recaII.
Yes, watch out here.
Why did you pIay Raging Remo with your defenceIess sister, Jeanie?
Let's see how that fits together.
Watch out there.
We're not taIking too much taIky town taIk.
WeII, what aiIing KTNS reporter Iikes to sing in the shower?
Perhaps you shouId ask her downstairs neighbour why.
Okay.
WeII, for aII these questions, I'm sure you know the answers, Mindy.
I hope this brought back Iots of coIours to your cheek.
We'II be back, BouIder, so keep your stations tuned in and we're gonna dish tiII dawn.
Terrific, kid.
A star is born.
WeII.
Congrat-- CongratuIations.
I'd have sworn you were Miss Rona if I hadn't seen your hair move.
- AII right, where's Mork the Mouse?
- Yeah, where is he?
- Look, Remo, we're aII mad at Mork.
- Yeah.
So Iet's just caIm down, be rationaI, and find out how high he can bounce.
That's right.
- WeII - Oh, hoId that pose.
Wait, are we aII supri--?
Wait, is this a surprise party for me just for what I did this evening?
- You - Hey!
Hey.
We are aII very mad at you.
Why, because you didn't bring the punch and the cookies?
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let's not get physicaI here.
Maybe you guys aII shouId go home and Iet me handIe this.
That sounds reasonabIe, Mindy.
I guess we were taking the Iaw in our own hands.
Besides, it wiII give me time to find a taxidermist.
Mork wiII Iook great above my mantIe.
I don't know if I can ever caII you snuggIepuss again.
Wait, wait, wait.
Was it something I said?
Why do I feeI Iike we're gonna have one of our IittIe taIks?
Come in, pIease.
Hi, there.
Wanna get wet?
Look, Mr. BickIey, I can expIain this.
See, Mork was feeIing-- Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
I saw Mork's show, and I didn't beIieve a word of it.
But I'm happy to report that BouIder does.
The phone hasn't stopped ringing.
How nice.
As a famous greeting card writer, I'm used to this kind of sordid innuendo.
You have no idea how many fans out there are after a piece of the Bick.
Yes, I think we've heard enough.
WeII, kids, I'II be running aIong now.
WeII, I'm gIad you didn't beIieve that siIIy story.
Not a word of it.
If you're not busy Iater on, you know where to find me.
Don't beat me.
Don't beat me.
PIease, don't beat me Now do you see what can happen when rumours get started?
WeII, Mr. BickIey was happy, Mind.
He's one out of the whoIe town.
That's not a great average, Mork.
Do you reaIize how many reputations you couId have ruined tonight?
Everyone was happy when I toId them juicy pieces of gossip.
I don't even understand why I'm on the endangered Orkan Iist.
I mean, it's not fair, Mind.
It's not fair, not fair.
Mork, that's because no one Iikes to hear gossip about themseIves.
It's aII right when it's about somebody eIse.
Isn't that a IittIe two-sided?
WaIking the two-sided way of Iife.
No way, doubIe truths.
DoubIe truths, watch out.
Wait a minute.
Let me put it to you this way.
How wouId you Iike it if I toId everyone that you ate eggs?
Lying shiksa goddess.
So how does it feeI?
WeII Give me that.
WeII, I didn't teII any Iies, Mind.
Yeah, but you didn't teII the whoIe truth, either.
And sometimes, haIf-truths are worse than Iies.
How come they do it in the papers and TV and you were about to do it?
I didn't say I was gonna do it.
I didn't say I was gonna do it.
I just said I got sick.
Isn't that a haIf-truth?
The point is, you better do something, or you're gonna Iose aII your friends.
And I better do something or I'm gonna Iose my job.
- What can we do, Mind?
- I don't know.
But we've got a Iot of peopIe to apoIogise to, and we've gotta find a way to do it.
WeII, Iet's start tonight.
I'II go get Mr. BickIey, and I'II meet you in the shower.
Five, four, three, two, we're Iive.
Hi, I'm Mindy McConneII and the show is Rumour Has lt.
Today's topic, What Makes a Good Gossip Report?
To answer that question, I've invited back yesterday's guest host, Mork.
Hey, hi, you, Ed.
How about that band, huh?
Hey, hey, Doc.
Hi, Snoozy, Lumpy, Squeezy.
Mork was a IittIe Iate in getting here.
I was a IittIe Iate.
How Iate was I?
- So Iate, the rabbit had been dead-- - Why don't we take a behind-the-scenes Iook at what goes into making a good gossip report.
Oh, thank you, what a wiIdIy spontaneous pre-rehearsed idea.
Thanks for setting me up for that one.
BIess you.
Yes, to continue, maybe you couId teII us, Mork, what ingredients go into a good gossip report?
AII right.
First of aII, you have to have the right costume.
It's very important to be inconspicuous when you're out searching for information.
It aIso takes the right attitude and especiaIIy, the right questions.
For exampIe.
Hey, are you stiII beating that dog of yours?
What?
I don't have a dog.
Got fed up and ran away.
Hey, so it's just you and the goat now, huh?
What?
What goat?
Oh, there's more than one?
Maybe there's a sheep going, ''Not bad.
'' As you can see, there's no answering a question Iike that.
You got it, dog beater.
CouId we just continue with what we discussed?
Like why my stories may appear to be a IittIe duII compared to yours.
AII right, I'II give you a IittIe exampIe right here.
Pick any story and we'II spice it up.
We'II make that sucker sing.
AII right, Iet's see.
I think I have a story right here.
Okay, here's one: ''Last night, young Amy Prescott was rescued from a second-story fire by voIunteer fireman Rob WiIson.
She suffered from smoke inhaIation and had to be revived by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
She is reported in good condition at a County HospitaI.
'' Boring, Mind.
Snooze City.
I wouIdn't buy that in a supermarket checkout.
I wouIdn't even buy it for the cat.
What wouId you do to make that more interesting?
Observe, Mindy, watch this pIace sizzIe.
Young Amy teIIs aII about burning desire of second-story man.
DateIine SizzIe City.
Watch out.
Last night, whiIe Mr. and Mrs. BouIder were sIeeping, Rob WiIson's temperature was rising as he crept into Amy Prescott's room wearing rubber boots and a heImet.
Watch out.
And aII young Amy remembers is his hot sweaty face Iooming over her as he pressed his parched Iips to hers.
Then he roared off in the night in his Iong red vehicIe, Ieaving young Amy to wonder where, who, why.
You know, I think I'm beginning to understand.
And you know what?
I don't think I couId do that kind of reporting.
Even if it means my job.
WeII, Mind, there's a price we aII have to pay and I have had to pay a certain price too.
I wanna ask you aII, what's missing from this picture?
That's right.
AII my friends.
I just want to say to aII of them, I'm sorry for what I said yesterday because it wasn't true, and I And you're the best friends I have in the worId, and I reaIIy miss you.
NeIson, Remo, Jeanie and GIenda.
I'II take a picture next time and don't be mad.
WeII, the choice is yours, peopIe of BouIder.
Is this gossip the kind of reporting you wanna see, or wouId you rather hear the truth?
We'II be back after this commerciaI.
Good stand, Mindy.
But I opt for the smut.
The phones are Iighting up, Miss McConneII.
It's your friends.
They Iike your show, and they forgive Mork.
Oh, hurray and huzzah.
Too bad you're not working for them.
WeII, I'm sorry, Mr. Sternhagen, but I just can't do that kind of gossip reporting.
Then you Ieave me with no choice.
- Oh, I'II take it, Mr. Sternhagen.
- Mork.
I mean, I've got one more story, some reaI dirt, some terra firma here.
Excuse me, sir, but do you know who this is?
- Where did you get that?
- Let's say I have my sources.
The story goes Iike this: What's this BouIder TV exec doing with this bombsheII who's not his wife?
- Then the story gets hot and intense.
- That's my daughter.
Oh, why teII peopIe that and ruin a perfectIy good story?
Yes, I see.
You know, Mindy, you're right about this show.
That's what I Iike about you.
You've got principIes.
Why don't you take the night off and I'II carry on from here?
Thank you, Mr. Sternhagen.
Back on.
Good evening.
And weIcome to the Farm Report.
- Pork beIIies are Iow - Where did you get that picture?
I thought you'd Iearned.
None of your business.
Oh, you're right.
But you know, Mr. Sternhagen's daughter is reaIIy beautifuI.
Yeah, but I don't think she gets aIong with her mother weII.
Why wouId you say that?
When Mrs. Sternhagen came into the restaurant, her daughter ducked under the tabIe and crawIed out the back door.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, oh, Chubby Cheeker.
Mork, why are we whispering?
Sir, don't teII a souI.
I've got a story that's gonna make your toes tingIe.
Isn't that right, Beebs?
What are you talking about, Mork?
WeII, sir, we're taIking about gossip.
You know, your rumours, your innuendo, your hearsay.
This week, I Iearned how popuIar it is with EarthIings unIess it's about them.
People like to hear things that aren't true?
Oh, yes, Your Skinnyness.
l get your point.
But you see, sir, sometimes these stories can get out of hand.
EarthIings are given a speciaI priviIege caIIed freedom of speech.
But it isn't reaIIy free if it costs someone his reputation.
Are you saying this freedom must be exercised with caution?
Oh, yes, sir.
It comes with a responsibiIity of knowing what not to say and when not to say it.
lnteresting.
And yet you say gossip is popular on Earth.
Yes, I'm afraid peopIe wiII aIways have an appetite for juicy titbits, even though most of it is hard to swaIIow.
UntiI next week, sir, bon appetit.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
I can't beIieve it.
What a morning to be Iate.
Oh, I'd Iike to get my hands on the guy who invented the snooze aIarm.
Morning, morning Oh, Mind, Iet me heIp you with those suckers.
Come on now, hon.
That's aII right.
Isn't that IoveIy?
- Here we are.
- Thanks, Mork.
But I was trying to put the boot on.
Oh, I guess we start off the day on the wrong foot, huh?
WeII, Mind, I'm reaIIy famished.
I feeI Iike Gandhi at a McDonaId's.
Come on now.
I feeI I can eat an aardvark's tongue.
Come on now, Mind.
Sorry, Mork, but I'm production coordinator on a new show today and I've gotta be at the studio in ten minutes.
You couId fix me a minute steak.
That'II give you nine minutes to spare.
You're gonna have to fix your own breakfast today.
And maybe dinner too.
It might be another Iate night.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
Whoa, red Iight, whoa.
Stop, kemosabe.
Listen, you want moi to cook?
Yeah, you're a big Orkan now.
I think you can handIe yourseIf in the kitchen.
And maybe cIeaning up around here too.
Wait a minute, Mind, Mind.
I draw the Iine right there.
I wiII not cook, cIean or do windows.
I am man.
Watch me sit.
Where'd you get that idea?
Robert Petrie, Jim Anderson and Archie Bunker.
- Who?
- Mr. TeIevision.
WeII, Mork, that's a Iot of bunk.
TV isn't reaI Iife.
Oh, Mind, are you kidding?
Then Ricky reaIIy doesn't Iove Lucy?
Look, Mork, since I've been working, I just don't have enough time to do aII the things around the house.
I'm gonna need your heIp.
EnIightened Mork to the rescue.
But, pIease, don't make me cook, because I'II get thinner than RonaId Reagan's environmentaI budget.
Look, you traveIIed I think that you can pour yourseIf a bowI of cereaI.
Listen, I gotta run.
- WeII-- - I'II see you Iater.
Don't wait up.
It might be another Iate night.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Big kiss, Mindy-- She used to have time for a big kiss.
Now she hasn't even got time to pucker.
Oh, Mind, I knew you'd come-- Is the Iady of the house at home?
Exidor.
Mork, is that you?
Hey, what are we doing just standing here taIking?
Come on in.
My, my, my.
Isn't this a deIightfuI home?
Don't rush me, I'II get to the saIes pitch.
Good morning, sir or madam.
We represent the Exidor-to-Door Company.
ExcIusive distributors of these thingamajigs.
I'm sorry, Exidor, but I aIready have a thingamajig.
AII right, aII right.
I'II teII him what it does.
And why?
Because this miracIe of modern technoIogy can do everything a maid can do, except steaI the siIverware.
And next week, we're putting out an attachment for that.
- Amazing.
- Yes.
The revoIutionary new Maid-O-Matic.
Exidor, does this reaIIy make housework easier?
You don't want it?
I know, I know.
Go to the hard seII.
You buy this gizmo, or you'II never see your wife and kids again.
- I'm not married.
- We have an attachment for that too.
Maybe I shouId buy this.
Mindy says I shouId be heIping her - with the cooking and cIeaning.
- What?
Did you hear that, boys?
The skirt's pushing him around.
- No, she isn't.
- Is.
- Isn't.
- Is.
The vote is 1 2 to 1 against you.
WeII, I guess she is.
But aII I wanted to do was make housework easier.
Mork, Mork.
You whimpering washrag.
PuII yourseIf together.
Who wears the pants in this house?
You or the tomato?
WeII, she does.
But, weII, this man's had enough, though.
I'm not gonna Iet her push me around, because I'm gonna be the best IittIe wifey Mindy ever had.
But I do draw the Iine at motherhood.
Boy, housework is a snap.
I don't know what Erma Bombeck's kvetching about aII the time.
WeII, Iet's see.
Oh, here we go.
Oh, Iook, brown and bIack, Mindy's favourite coIours.
She won't mind.
It couId keep the bugs away.
Let's see.
What we do now?
WeII, I think I'II make a IittIe saIad for my breadwinner.
There we are.
Let's see, Iet's see.
Instructions.
''Put vegetabIes inside.
'' AII right, Iet's see.
Hey.
Hey.
Let's see.
''Turn on.
'' Wait a minute!
Wait!
Vesuvius.
Abandon-- Attention boys, abandon ship, abandon ship.
Save yourseIf.
What is going on?
Jiminy crickets.
What in the worId is going on here, Mork?
What are you trying to do, quaIify for a federaI disaster Ioan?
Mr. BickIey, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to heIp, and-- It Iooked easy at the time I was doing it.
Then aII of a suddenIike Krypton.
WeII, what did you expect?
Housework isn't easy.
It's miserabIe, backbreaking, repetitive, unrewarding, non-paying Iabour.
And Iook what it's done to my hands.
That's horribIe.
They Iook Iike Iobsters at a tanning saIon.
Quick, caII Madge.
- Mindy made it aIways Iook so easy.
- WeII, it isn't.
And my wife didn't Iike it either.
She wanted to get a job, but I Iaid down the Iaw.
I toId her, her job was to cook the meaIs and take care of the house.
After that, we never had another probIem.
- Everything was dokey-okey, right?
- Wrong.
She Ieft me.
You know, and I stiII miss the static on the TV when she'd vacuum under my feet.
I don't want Mindy to Ieave me.
You'd better caII her and find out how to run this pIace before it's too Iate.
I'II do that right away.
Five, four, three, two, cue music.
And WeIcome to Talk to Dr. Lincoln.
A unique caII-in program to heIp you, the viewer, with your probIem.
And now, here's eminent IocaI psychoIogist, Dr. Joni LincoIn.
Good afternoon.
For the next haIf-hour, I'II be taking your caIIs, and hopefuIIy heIping you get your Iife back on the track.
Our number is on your home screen and our Iines are open, so pIease caII in.
You'II be gIad you did.
And it's a Iot cheaper than an office visit.
There's our very first caIIer.
HeIIo, this is Dr. LincoIn.
Dr. Lincoln, l have been so paranoid lately.
lt seems like everybody is trying to get me.
I see.
And what--?
What is your name, ma'am?
Think you can trick me, huh?
What kind of a fool do you think l am?
Moving right aIong.
Let's try another caII.
HeIIo, this is Dr. LincoIn.
Hi, this is Mork.
Good afternoon, Mork.
How can I heIp you?
y es, may l talk to Mindy McConnell, please?
I'II kiII him.
Mork, she's a IittIe busy right now.
Oh, that's all right, l'll wait.
l have a canasta game going.
Mork, Iook, I have to keep this Iine open.
CouId Mindy caII you back Iater?
Kay-o.
Oh, that's Iive teIevision for you.
Let's try another caII.
HeIIo, this is Dr. LincoIn, and your first name is?
A short memory.
lt's Mork, remember now?
Mork, I'm sorry.
But this Iine is in use for peopIe with probIems.
Oh, l know-- l know that, and l've got a real doozy going here.
Mindy can take care of it, if l could talk to her for a millisecond.
Please.
What is it, Mork?
Mind, is that you?
l can barely hear you, hon.
Can you hear me now?
y es, Mind, and you look stunning.
How do you get zucchini stains off the ceiling?
Why don't I heIp you with that when I get home?
Bye, Mork.
y ou're not gonna wave and throw me a kiss like Dinah?
What does that mean, Mind?
Well, be home early.
And by the way, l love the show.
Especially the part, you know-- That lady should-- ls that a Princess phone?
And now a word from our sponsor.
Oh, Dr. LincoIn, I'm so embarrassed.
I-- I apoIogise.
It'II never happen again.
You must think I'm some kind of a Ioony.
No, Mindy, but I might suggest that this Mork come see me at the cIinic.
What is it now, Mork?
Oh, Mr. Sternhagen.
Yes, I'II be right in to see you.
I knew it was too good to Iast.
Mork.
Mork.
Mork?
Oh, there is my IoveIy, mobiIe career woman.
HeIIo, hon.
Gonna have dinner on the tabIe before we can say Poppin' Fresh.
Say, hi.
''Poppin' Fresh.
'' Too Iate.
Oh, Iook at this.
Got a IittIe bun in the oven for you here.
Hot potato, hot pota-- Nothing says Ioving Iike something from the oven.
Mork, I aImost Iost my job today.
Oh, hon, I know work was such a hard, hard thing today.
Come on.
Why don't you just sit down now and reIax?
You just sit down and rest those IittIe tired bones and tootsies.
- No probIem, there.
- Mork, I don't-- Whoa, no, no, no.
There's your IittIe pipe.
Here's the sports page.
I cut a few recipes out.
I hope you don't mind.
And we've got your IittIe sIippers here.
LittIe teddies on them.
Put those on.
You don't know what a hard day it's been for me.
Trying to put a waxy, yeIIow buiId-up on that fIoor.
Mork, I don't wanna taIk about the fIoor.
I wanna taIk about what happened at work today.
Work, work, work.
That's aII you type-A personaIities ever wanna taIk about.
You don't even think about me.
Nothing to worry about for me.
You aImost got me fired today.
You embarrassed me on the air, and-- And I just want you to promise that it wiII not happen again.
So this is the thanks I get for sIaving over a hot stove?
And working my fingers to the bone?
And wasting the best bleams of my Iife?
Oh, no.
Mork.
Look, Mork, caIm down.
No, you caIm down!
Here I am in this house cooped up aII day, vicariousIy Iiving through your expIoits.
Okay, Mork.
Look, forget-- Forget I ever mentioned anything about it.
Look, we'II sit down, we'II have a nice IittIe dinner, just the two of us.
You want your dinner, you eat out.
Mork, come on, you're overreacting.
No.
Don't touch me.
I have a headache.
And aIways remember, CaroI, that one day, your chiIdren wiII be parents too.
And that's when they'II get theirs.
Bye now.
WeII, that wraps up another session.
So untiI next time, this is Dr. Joni LincoIn hoping that aII your probIems are IittIe ones.
Are we stiII on the air, Mindy?
Oh, no, it's over.
I mean, wrap.
Let's wrap.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Dr. LincoIn.
I reaIIy am.
I don't know where my mind has been IateIy.
Oh, Mindy, are you aII right?
You've been forgetting cues, and whenever the phone rings, you cringe.
I know I'm not supposed to bring my probIems to work with me, but it's the guy I Iive with.
Mork?
WeII, he's just not adjusting very weII to my working.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be Iaying this aII on you.
Oh, pIease, everybody does.
It's part of the job.
Lay it on me.
WeII, it's just that the two of us WeII, I don't know, everything got turned around somehow.
- And it was pretty weird to begin with.
- I see.
WeII, Mindy, in any househoId, when a woman begins a career, there are aIways gonna be some adjustments.
I know, I went through it with my famiIy.
Yeah, but Mork has over-adjusted.
In one day, he went from being Ozzie to Harriet.
CouId be an identity probIem.
WeII, Mork shares in the housework, but I wanna heIp with those responsibiIities too.
I don't want him waiting on me hand and foot.
How Iong have you been Iiving together?
About three years.
Is your physicaI reIationship compatibIe?
WeII, I-- I guess that-- That aII depends on what you caII ''compatibIe.
'' I mean, we kiss and, you know-- But we don't You know.
But-- But we're compatibIe.
WeII, you know, Mindy, in any reIationship, it takes more than one person to make a probIem, and we can taIk about a number of ways to heIp improve things.
But right now, I'd rather you didn't say a word.
Why?
Because I think we're stiII on the air.
I'II be right in, Mr. Sternhagen.
Hi, Mork.
Oh, it's you.
How nice.
Did you happen to see the show today?
No, I had an exhausting afternoon at the day-care.
We had an artistic probIem.
There was crayon Iodged in Mrs. FowIer's ear.
WeII, Iisten.
Today I had a Iong conversation with Dr. LincoIn about our probIems.
ProbIems?
We have no probIems.
We're as happy as two moths on a porch Iight, you know: - Oh, Mork, no, we're not.
- Oh, yes, we are.
- And I'm part of the probIem.
- Oh, Mind, you know-- Oh, Mind, Mind.
You don't know what it's Iike to carry this aII aIone.
I thought I was an anchor around your neck.
I thought I was a hangnaiI on the finger of ambition.
Mind, how can we save the shambIes of this reIationship?
Dr. LincoIn suggested some ways that wouId heIp us to reIate better.
- They're reaIIy more Iike games.
- Games?
Why didn't you say so?
I'II be shirts and you be skins.
No, no, no.
They're not those kind of games.
WeII, actuaIIy, they're more Iike exercises in trust.
- Let's start with a simpIe one.
- AII right.
- AII right, you stand over here.
- Okay.
- Now, just stand straight.
- Okay.
Now, I want you to faII, and I'II catch you.
Sounds reasonabIe.
AII right.
Right, I'II go aIong with this, Mind, but if it doesn't work, I'm waIking.
No, that's what it's about.
You've gotta trust me.
- AII right.
- I promise I'II catch you.
- You promise?
- I promise.
AII right.
Custer.
Nice catch, Mind.
Mork, you were supposed to faII backwards.
I'm gonna get the hang of it now, Mind.
- Mind, something's not right here.
- Okay.
Yeah.
WhiIe you're stiII in one piece, Iet's try something eIse that might heIp us understand each other.
It's caIIed roIe reversaI.
It's where I pIay you and you pIay me, and then we act out a scene from our normaI daiIy Iife.
Oh, you mean, I'II be Mindy and you'II be Mork?
- There are Iaws against that, Mind.
- No, no.
- I think it couId onIy heIp.
- WeII, aII right.
WeII, give me tiII tomorrow morning to shave my Iegs.
I have to pIuck my eyebrows and buy some things.
I'II be back.
- Morning, Mind.
- Morning, Mork.
Oh, gosh and goIIy.
Late again.
Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
WiII you fix me breakfast?
WiII you, huh?
WiII you?
I'm so hungry I couId eat Bebo.
Mork, I haven't got time right now.
I'm too busy being a butch career girI.
Hey, wait a minute.
That's hitting beIow the beIt.
And stop it, you're gonna stretch out my boots.
These are your boots?
I reaIIy had to stuff socks in the front.
Oh, Mork, you're so taIented and handsome, and you have such great taste in cIothes.
Hey, wait a minute.
I never said that.
WeII, it wouId be nice if you did once in a whiIe.
Mork, Mork.
Where are my car keys?
Did you bury them again?
WeII, I Iocked them in the jeep so they wouIdn't get Iost.
Did I do good?
Did I?
Did I, huh?
Do I get goId star?
AbsoIuteIy not.
- Mork, come, sit down.
- Sense of impending doom.
Now, here we go.
Let's sit down and taIk.
Not-- Not on your face.
Now, Mork, Mork Mork, I reaIise you're an aIien that doesn't know his eIbow from his raznick.
Yes, but I never wouId've done it without your patience and understanding.
Oh, reaIIy?
Phone.
HeIIo?
It's Mr. Sternhagen, my boss.
Yes, Mr. Sternhagen?
Yes, I'm stiII here.
Yes.
No, I-- I-- I have a IittIe jeep probIem.
You're right, that's no reason to Iose my job.
Thank you.
Bye, Mr. Sternhagen.
Good news?
I have to be at the station in ten minutes or I'm off the air forever.
AII right, here.
You just have to fix yourseIf breakfast, and I'II be home before midnight.
But-- But-- But, Mind Wait a minute, Mork.
Wait.
Don't Ieave without giving me a big-- Kiss?
I've been ignoring you, haven't I?
WeII, who couId bIame you?
I didn't reaIise I was that hard to Iive with.
As a roommate, I'm no John Ritter.
Oh, Mork, you're terrific.
Different, but terrific.
Oh, Mork, our Iives are changing, and we just have to do a better job of changing with them.
You're right.
From now on, I'm onIy gonna do my share.
I mean, housework is reaIIy hard.
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna try not to use so much of myseIf up at the office that I have nothing Ieft to give to you.
See, I feeI better aIready.
We're gonna have to promise each other that we'II aIways teII each other how we're feeIing.
You got it.
I feeI happy now.
- WeII, that's good.
- Yeah, and now, I feeI happier.
- Oh, reaIIy?
- Now it feeIs Iike aImost joy.
Oh, it is joy.
Goodbye, joy, heIIo, ecstasy.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork caIIing Orson.
Come in, Orson.
HeIIo, anybody home?
Mork, l love what you've done with your hair.
Oh, no, Orson.
Sir, it's me, Mindy McConneII.
Remember me?
I was here a few months ago with Mork-- Silence.
Where is Mork?
What's happened to his report?
Oh, weII, sir, you see, Mork and I started sharing aII our responsibiIities IateIy, so here I am.
But if you'd reaIIy rather speak to Mork, I couId go get-- Just get on with it.
Oh, okay.
See, my report is reaIIy about my and Mork's reIationship.
Again?
Wh--?
He toId you about it?
- What did he say?
- Everything.
WeII, he couIdn't have, sir, because a good reIationship is aIways changing and growing.
But if a relationship works well, why would you want to change it?
WeII, sometimes there's no choice.
I mean, you never know what hurdIes Iife is gonna pIace in front of you.
And each one is a test of how much you care.
And sometimes, even if you don't have troubIe getting over them, your partner may.
So you either stop and heIp them over or you go on aIone.
- Did I do aII right?
- Not bad for an Earthling.
Oh, that's big of you, sir.
No, I-- No, I didn't mean ''big.
'' I meant, that's good of you, sir.
Did--?
Maybe we can do this again sometime soon.
Don't press your luck.
Right.
WeII, this is Mindy McConneII signing off for Mork.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Okay, attention, everybody.
I wouId Iike to propose a toast to Mr. BickIey on his birthday.
Happy birthday, Mr. BickIey.
WeII, thank you.
Happy Bickday, Birth.
My coIIeagues and moi have created the worId's first Mork-O-Gram.
utiIising the Ietters of your name.
Ready?
B is for the buddy that you've aIways been to me.
I is for the iIIusions you shattered.
Like when you toId me the Easter bunny has rabies.
C is for cake.
When do we eat?
Why isn't this working out Iike I pIanned?
AII right, Morkettes.
PIan B. Happy 50, Bicky.
That's terrific.
WouId the Morkettes Iike a piece of cake?
No, thanks, Mindy.
The moment was enough for me.
Come on, IittIe munchkins.
I'II bring some cake to you at the day-care centre tomorrow.
You'd better, buster, or I just may forget I'm a Iady.
That was reaIIy sweet of those IittIe girIs.
Thanks, Mork.
I didn't have the heart to teII them I was onIy 49.
Forty-nine?
Wait a minute.
We caIIed your son Tom, and he said you were 50.
Oh, he confuses me with PauI Newman.
Look, I'II show you my driver's Iicense.
That wiII prove concIusiveIy that I'm reaIIy onIy There, you s Oh, my God, I am 50.
WeII, weIcome to the haIf-century cIub.
So we're 50, so what?
At 50, our Iives are just beginning.
Yes, if you were a tortoise, you'd be just a baby.
And if you were an eIephant, you'd be a teenager.
And if you were a dog, you'd be dead.
I feeI Iike I've Iost a whoIe year.
I mean, I'm 50.
AII those things I've never done.
- What kind of things?
- You know, stuff you put off.
Like, weII, I've never read the entire BibIe.
I've never seen the Grand Canyon or Niagara FaIIs.
You know what reaIIy gets me?
I never toId my son the facts of Iife.
- How oId is he?
- Twenty-seven.
WeII, he's probabIy stiII up.
Why don't you give him a caII?
I'II bet he's with some girI, wondering what to do.
Nobody ever had to teII me the facts of Iife.
- Guys know, right, Mork?
- Hey, yo, yo, yo.
Let's face it.
I'm an oId man.
So many things I shouId've done and didn't do.
Opportunity raced by and Ieft me sniffing its exhaust.
Come on, Mr. BickIey.
Don't be so hard on yourseIf.
I mean, regrets have nothing to do with age.
We aII have them.
You know, things we didn't do, things we shouId have done.
Oh, regrets.
I've had a few, but I've handIed them my way.
Oh, what couId you possibIy have to regret, you IittIe pixie pants?
WeII, oh, bIess you.
WeII, the fact that, weII, my foot doesn't have a thumb, that my ears don't spin in the wind, that I'II never find out who RuIa Lenska was.
Hey, you know what might be reaIIy interesting tonight?
If we aII shared our regrets with everybody eIse.
It'II heIp Mr. BickIey.
And we'II aII get to know each other a Iot better.
Oh, pIease say yes.
I'm for anything that'II heIp poor oId Mr. BickIey.
Mindy, it's your apartment.
Why don't you go first?
It's aIways her apartment.
I Iive here too.
I onIy regret that I don't have her cIout.
Mindy, what is it that you regret most in your Iife?
Oh, I'd reaIIy rather not go first.
You know, kind of shy and aII.
WouId anyone Iike some coffee?
Oh, curiosity at her strange evasion.
WeII, then, I'II go first.
Why did I say that?
This is going to be embarrassing.
Oh, go for it, Jeanie.
WeII What I most regret in Iife has to do with a man named Tony.
I remember him.
He was a big guy, aImost 5'8''.
He reaIIy knew how to taIk to me.
I was kind of quiet and shy, and I reaIIy didn't think very much of myseIf at the time.
But what I saw in Tony's eyes was so much nicer than anything I'd ever seen in my own mirror.
Can you imagine having somebody make you feeI that speciaI?
How Iong did you and this Tony go together?
Two months Before I found out he was married.
Married?
You mean he was cheating on you?
Now, wait a second, that guy, Tony, you dated him over a year.
- That's my regret.
- Oh, I can't beIieve this.
My IittIe sister pIaying Dallas in the Bronx.
- Mindy, wouId you Iike to go next?
- Oh, I'd rather not.
You know, NeIson's dying to go next.
- He is?
- Yeah.
I bet the onIy he regrets is his IittIe pink eyes can't stand this much Iight.
ActuaIIy, my biggest regret is that GIenda stiff-armed me at the drive-in Iast night.
I toId you, that's not where the popcorn dropped.
Come on, NeIson, there must be something in that aIbino souI of yours that you wanna Iet out of there.
Let it out, Iet it fIy.
Open up, open up, open up.
Yeah, make us cry.
WeII, there is something.
It's been haunting me for years.
- I was 1 5-- - That's a good one.
Who's next?
And every morning, I'd take the bus to schooI, the Number 26 bus.
One morning, she gets on.
She had the prettiest bIond hair I'd ever seen, besides my own.
She took my breath away.
I watched her as she sat down.
About the same distance as Mork is sitting now.
Oh, reaIIy?
Kind of Iike this?
I couIdn't take my eyes off her.
I kept staring at her, thinking, ''I've gotta meet this person.
'' But before I couId think of how to approach her, the bus stopped and she got up to Ieave.
She passed in front of me on the way to the exit.
Excuse me.
She smiIed poIiteIy and Got off the bus.
My heart was pounding.
I wanted to meet her and get to know her so bad.
AII I had to do was foIIow her off the bus and say heIIo, but I just sat there.
The bus puIIed away.
I watched her through the window.
I saw her grow smaIIer and smaIIer in the distance.
There went my dream.
AII right, weII, now, who's gonna go next?
Mindy?
Oh, I'd reaIIy Iike to, but I have to get the ice cream for the cake.
I'II go warm up the ketchup.
Mind, Mind, I sense a certain aversion to airing your regret.
I mean, am I right, am I wrong?
Why do I ask another question?
There, I did it again, but Oh, Mork, it's just that it's very personaI.
I'd reaIIy rather teII you when we're aIone.
Our sense of intimacy grows.
WeII, ever since I was a IittIe girI, I wanted to be a dancer.
I aIways heard music in my head, and my body just seemed to wanna move to it.
I started with baIIet when I was about 5, and I just Ioved it so much.
And one day my father said to me, ''Where's the newspaper?
'' And I said, ''Over there.
'' Then I feII on my tutu.
WeII, after the baIIet, there was tap and jazz and modern, and I just feIt so free.
And then RandoIph came into my Iife.
And, you know, he Ioved to dance just as much as I did.
I don't think our feet touched the ground for our entire marriage.
And then I was aIone.
And I haven't feIt Iike dancing since.
It's not right to cIose off a part of you, is it?
GIenda Faye, wouId you dance with me?
Oh, you mean now?
WeII, I've got the music in me.
Oh, no, I don't think so.
No.
- Sure, come on.
- No, no.
Yeah, my dad's got a barn.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Oh, no.
Music, minstreI.
WeII, my regret is that women onIy want me for my body.
What?
Wanna trade regrets?
It's not funny, Mr. BickIey.
It's a curse I've had to Iive with.
GirIs onIy see me as a pIaything.
I have a mind too, you know.
I don't beIieve this.
I mean, when I'm on a date, aII I hear is: ''Remo, make a muscIe.
Remo, make a muscIe.
'' You know how cheap this makes me feeI?
Hey, Iook, at heart, I'm an oId-fashioned guy.
I don't know, these days, aII women wanna do is grope, grope, grope.
I'm tired of being a phone number passed around at the beauty parIour.
You understand, don't you, Mr. McConneII?
I want a reIationship.
I'm sorry, Remo, but he's aIready married.
I can't heIp that God buiIt me this way.
You know how it feeIs when a woman Iooks at my shirt, and then whispers to her girIfriend, ''I wonder if they're reaI''?
Tragic.
I don't know, I just pray that somewhere, there's some woman sensitive enough to, I don't know, see beyond this cIassic sheII of a man.
I want her to discover the reaI Remo, to reach out for me.
I wanna be taIked to, I wanna be heId.
WeII, I'm sure there's someone out there somewhere.
I just hope she's buiIt.
Yo, yo, yo.
AII right, who hasn't spiIIed his guts yet?
Let's see, I think it's Mr. McConneII and Mindy.
Dad, wiII you go next?
Come on, Pops, teII them about the time you were soId into baId sIavery.
WeII, there is something I've Iived with for quite some time.
Even Mindy doesn't know about it.
ReaIIy?
What is it?
It happened November 24th, 1 950.
In Korea.
It was Iate.
We were on patroI.
I remember trudging through the frozen mud in a miserabIe 5 beIow.
SuddenIy, the sky Iit up with incoming sheIIs, and we aII scattered into the woods.
I'd never seen trees broken off at the top before.
Or men either.
Now, the sheIIing stopped, and I was surrounded by an eerie siIence.
Just then, I heard the frozen mud crunch behind me.
I Iooked around, and I saw somebody charging me with a fixed bayonet.
Before he couId get to me, I raised my rifIe and I shot him.
And he fIew back into a sheII hoIe, dead.
Mindy, I kiIIed a man.
Oh, but, Dad, you had to.
He wouId've kiIIed you.
He was the enemy, UncIe Fred.
When he's three feet away, he's another human being.
The Iook on his face as his Iife Ieft him There are nights when I stiII see it.
I just wish I didn't have to puII that trigger.
If you didn't, Fred, you wouIdn't be here with us.
Yeah, and you never wouId've had Mindy.
Mork, you're right.
Yeah, and I wouId probabIy be Iiving with Mr. BickIey.
Then I'd reaIIy have a regret to share with you aII.
My, some of these regrets are heavy.
You know, but they make me feeI so much cIoser to aII of you tonight.
It feeIs reaIIy very good.
I never knew exposing myseIf was such a warm experience.
WeII, it's been an interesting party, but it's past my bedtime.
Hey, wait a minute.
Mindy, you haven't toId us your regret.
- Come on, Iet's go.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Come on.
- Yeah, Mindy, come on.
No, no, no.
She has no regrets.
She's Ied a perfect Iife, thanks to me and her Lady Remington.
Come on, Mindy.
WeII, you see, I reaIIy can't - The door.
The door.
- Regrettus interruptus.
Oh, no.
- Mork, is that you?
- It's me, Exidor.
No, I'm Exidor, you're Mork.
- Who is that?
- Exidor, the town Ioon.
I resent that, CurIy.
I don't Iive in town.
I'm a VaIIey guy.
I bring bad news, Mork.
It's not going to be easy.
I'd better sit down.
I just got back from the doctor.
- Which doctor?
- ExactIy.
He toId me in SwahiIi I've onIy got 41 years to Iive.
Here's his note describing my condition.
''Your mama.
'' For goodness' sakes, Exidor, Easy for you to say, cue baII, you've got your heaIth.
I'm about to punch out.
That's why I pIan to spend my Iast waning moments here in this house, with my dearest friends.
Imagine our excitement.
I'II just Iie down unobtrusiveIy.
AII of you vitaI peopIe just go on with whatever you were doing.
Okay, Mindy, what are your regrets?
What?
Remo, there is a man in a robe Iying on us.
I couIdn't heIp overhearing.
What's this garbage about regrets?
We're teIIing each other things we regret the most.
Oh, I've got one.
Besides the fact that Whitey here's got boney knees.
You know, Mork, I've been feeIing reaIIy down in the dumps since my wife Ieft me.
You must've been awfuIIy shocked when she bit through the Ieash and got away.
I was feeIing reaIIy Iow there for a whiIe.
I even Iet my appearance go.
And then, as fate wouId have it, I became attached to another woman.
DeepIy attached.
My regret is that I haven't toId her my feeIings.
Oh, weII, then by aII means, go and teII her now.
ShouId I, Mork?
ShouId I run to her and risk rejection, not to mention mono?
Yes, yes.
Go to her.
Let your heart fIy Iike a moth into a bIowtorch.
I Iove you, my sweet.
I wanna have your baby!
Oh, no.
No way, not me.
I see.
Goodbye, Whitey, Shorty, CurIy.
You too, Perky.
You know, Mork, you're the onIy one here with a normaI name.
WeII, I hate to admit it, but this has been the best 50-year-oId birthday party I've ever had.
And you've aII heIped me Iearn something here tonight.
Age has nothing to do with regrets.
I can do aII those things I've aIways wanted to do starting tomorrow.
Who the heII's stopping me?
- Right, yeah.
- Come on.
But tonight, I need my rest.
I've got 50 years of Iiving starting tomorrow.
Come on, Frankie, Iet's see if we can beat these kids to the door.
- Come on.
- WeII, the guest of honour is Ieaving.
It doesn't take the roof to faII in on my head.
I know the party's over.
Sorry I didn't get to hear your regret, Mindy.
- Oh, it'II keep.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Good night.
- Bye, thanks for coming.
Thank you.
- ReaI nice to have friends, huh?
- Yeah.
- See you.
- Bye, Remo.
Yo, yo, yo.
AII right, Mind, you can teII me now.
What was your regret?
Come on, now.
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, okay, Iet me sit down.
My regret is that my mother had to die before she got a chance to meet you.
See, I couIdn't say that in front of everybody, because then I'd have to expIain that I wanted her to know everything about you, and WeII, the fact I came from another pIanet and everything.
Yeah.
And that you're as cIose to me as she was.
And that you're the most important thing in my Iife.
DeepIy moved.
Oh, my mom wouId've Iiked you, Mork, I just know it.
- I wouId've Iiked her too.
- Yeah.
I know what I wouId've said to her too.
- You do?
- Sure.
HeIIo, Mrs. McConneII.
That's my way of saying shaIom.
No, ma'am, I don't Iive around here, I Iive here.
With Mindy, yes, ma'am.
WeII, we're very cIose.
No, no, no, not that cIose.
I don't even know what that is.
You see, ma'am, I'm a creature from another pIanet.
You know: You know, Iike Alien.
Except that I'm cuter, and I don't skitter across the fIoor Iike that.
Oh, yes, ma'am, I'm singIe.
You know, if it wasn't for Mindy taking in strays, I wouId never have a pIace to be.
I just wanna thank you for bringing her into this worId.
Do I Iove her?
WeII I wanna give her everything I have and spend the rest of my Iife with her.
Is that Iove?
You know, it's kind of funny that I had to come miIIions of miIes to find something deep inside of me.
I wonder if she feeIs the same way.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I shouId ask her myseIf.
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you very much.
I Iike you too.
That's what I wouId've said to your mom.
I had a feeIing you were trying to say something to me too.
Mork, was my mother reaIIy here?
She toId me to give you something.
I Iove you, Mindy.
I Iove you too, Mork.
