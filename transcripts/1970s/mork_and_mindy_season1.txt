{START OF EPISODE 1}
Boy, am I in for it now.
Sent before the White Desk again.
What did I do?
The Solar Lander, you fool.
You painted a mustache on it.
But Orson doesn't know I did it.
Then why am I here?
If I knew that, I wouldn't be talking to myself.
Mork.
Good morning, Orson.
Orson you call me Orson to my face, but behind my back, you call me "Fatso," "Rocket Ship Thighs," and "Star Tush".
You forgot "Laser Breath".
Sorry, Your Immenseness.
See what I mean?
These constant displays of humor are not acceptable behavior here on Ork.
You're right.
We are rather a dull lot; the white bread of the universe.
Emotions have been weeded out of us for the good of the race, and you constantly make jokes.
I'm afraid that won't do.
Uh-oh.
There's an insignificant planet on the far side of the galaxy.
From the fragmented reports we have on it, the people are well, uh Real nimnulls?
Exactly.
That's why I think you'll fit in there, Mork.
You're too kind, sir.
What is the name of this hellhole you're sending me to?
Earth.
Earth?
I was on Earth three bleems ago.
I was sent there by a biology class to collect a specimen.
I had to throw it back, though too small.
I love that place.
Well, don't enjoy it too much.
It's not a vacation.
We want you to learn all you we can about primitive societies.
Your mission is to report back to me mentally about the things you learn there.
And remember, this is a serious mission.
You can count on me, Orson.
D, D and E. Dedicated, diligent and efficient.
Nanu-nanu.
Nanu-nanu.
I love this spot.
It's beautiful.
You know, the reason I enjoy taking you out is you don't put pressure on me.
You don't force me into playing that virile stud macho role, you know?
Aha!
Gizbah.
Shazbot.
Ah.
Only one suitcase?
You lost half my luggage, you nimnulls!
Oh, Mindy!
Stop it!
Don't you ever do that again!
Not even if my blouse is on fire!
I can't believe you.
Three dates and you think you've got the right to attack me like a Thanksgiving turkey?
!
Oh, I love it when you talk dirty.
What?
Will you cut it out?
Now, look, You know, I liked you a lot better when you were ineffectual.
I don't even think I like you at all after tonight.
Good point.
I think I should take you home because I respect you.
Well, I'll drive to make sure we get to our respective homes still respecting each other.
Well, if that's the way you feel about it, why don't you just walk home?
Oh!
If that's the way you want it, I'll be happy to walk home.
Hey, wait a minute!
That's my car!
Nanu-nanu.
Father what are you doing out here?
This is where I was dropped off.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I got dropped off, too.
You don't know what happened to me!
He just took my car!
Well, I'm glad to have someone I can trust to walk into town with.
I mean, this isn't a confession or anything, but I only had three crummy dates with the guy and he takes my car and makes me walk!
Very interesting.
Mind if I take notes?
I don't know where he gets off  Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Ah!
Well, here it is.
Thanks a lot for walking me home, Father.
I'm afraid I hardly gave you a chance to talk, but I was just so mad.
You know what I mean?
Nab, nab.
My pleasure.
I was sent here to learn, you know?
Well, if there's anything I can do for you If it's not too precious, a glass of water.
And if it is, a quart of oil will suffice.
Oh  I think I can spring for the water.
Spring water.
Humor.
Better yet.
How about a little iced tea?
When on Earth, do as the Earthlings.
How are they treating you?
Do you talk to your plants, too?
Oh, yes, they're good listeners.
Especially the old ones.
Yeah, I talk to my plants all the time.
Keeps them young and keeps them healthy.
Oh Your suit's on backwards.
It is?
Boy, do I feel like a clone.
You're not a priest.
Who are you?
I am Mork from Ork.
Nanu-nanu.
Ork?
!
Yes, you see, Ork is a planet.
You follow the Big Dipper till it comes to a dead end, then you hang an up.
An up.
Up, down, hard to tell out in hyperspace.
Oh, right.
I have a poor sense of direction myself.
So, you're, you're from outer space.
Yes, do you mind if I take a few pictures for the folks on the home planet?
They'd like to get some postcards.
Uh, no.
Okay, watch the flookie.
How did you do that?
With my Instamatic glove some models starting under 30 thribets.
Oh mind if I do?
The pause that refreshes.
You drank that with your finger!
Yes.
How do you drink?
With my mouth.
Well, how do you talk and drink at the same time?
Must be Drool City.
Now, look, whoever you are, now you can't scare me.
Now, there's no such thing as a man from outer space.
Now, I don't know how you did those tricks, but you just better keep your distance or you're going to hear me scream like you've never heard anybody scream.
I've never heard anyone scream.
Is that your way of saying thanks?
Aha!
Help has already arrived, so you just stay cool, space man, or else   It's for you.
Ah, my lost luggage.
clothes are in there.
Take a hike.
Scrim, scrim.
Oh, I forgot.
Sorry.
Here we go.
Keep the change.
You really are from out there.
No, actually, I'm from out there.
You see, out there's not a nice neighborhood.
I wouldn't even go there during a total eclipse.
An alien.
You're not going to hurt me, are you?
Hurt you?
!
No, damaging other life forms is unthinkable to us.
I wouldn't harm a harf on your choli-cho-cho.
It occurs to me we have not been formally introduced.
A formal introduction is at hand.
Get down.
I am Mork from Ork.
Nanu-nanu.
Oh I'm, I'm Mindy McConnell.
: Ah.
I like a being with a firm gribbet.
Shows character.
At least evolution.
Oh Well, thank you.
Uh how do you say thank you in your language?
We spit.
Mind if I don't say thank you?
No sweat off my front.
I just, I just can't believe this.
I'm standing here talking to an alien.
Do you realize the historic sweep of this?
I mean, the world will be astounded!
No, nab, nab.
You see, my mission is to observe Earth.
And the only way I can do that is by being one of you, a face in the crowd.
Which is easy because I fit right in.
Not really.
No?
No.
Are you sure?
Oh, I'm sure.
I tell you what.
Now, I'm as interested in you and your planet as you are about us so how about I can teach you to act Earthling if you teach me more about Ork?
Is that a deal?
A fair exchange.
Let's formally close the deal.
Mind if I just spit?
It's your house.
I will be staying here, won't I?
I mean, I've heard so much about your Earthling hospitality.
Oh, well, you can, uh temporarily.
Oh, but if my father finds out Father?
!
On Earth you have natural parents.
You see, I'm a test tube baby.
Really?
Yes.
My father was an eyedropper, the scum.
Why would you say that?
Well, he ran away and left Mom.
Ran off with a bottle of nose drops.
Can't blame him, though.
She had those tight labels.
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on, please, hey.
Stop!
Stop!
It's too early in the morning for "Dueling Beethoven".
It's the only music I can challenge him with, dear.
He won't play anything by Alice Cooper.
That's because I play piano.
Alice Cooper just beats on the keys with a dead snake.
But at least he shows feeling.
Are you two going to start this again?
I am a musician.
I sell violins and I sell cellos.
They're classics.
That's food for the spirit and a feast for the soul.
While you peddle  junk food.
Frederick Huh?
If you were in Heaven and God said, "I will give you a choice "you can be born with brains, or you can born with a permanent rash on your fanny".
Now which would you choose?
The brains.
Good.
I see you learn by your mistake.
Mother-in-laws are the curse of marriage.
Oh, Daddy, you know she loves to tease you.
It's what keeps her young.
Yes, but it's making me old.
Mindy, isn't that your second cup of coffee?
It's my fourth.
But you don't drink coffee.
Why are you all of a sudden drinking gallons of coffee, unless you stayed up late.
You're right.
This must be my first cup of coffee.
Mindy Dad, I was up late last night.
Dad, I met the most fascinating person.
I was up half the night talking to him.
Him?
Half the night?
Dad, I'm 21.
Oh, honey, I know, I know.
It's just that I'll always think of you as my little girl.
I know you will.
Hey, Mindy, look who I found wandering the streets looking for you.
Correction, munchkin-like person: I wasn't wandering, I was trying to explore your world.
He's new in town, Eugene.
Mork, I'll be happy to show you around after work.
Work?
Oh, yes.
Most people have to work for a living.
What a novel concept.
Mindy, who's your beatnik friend?
Uh Daddy, this is Mork.
Mork, this is Mr. McConnell.
Nanu-nanu.
Mork, he's my father.
What an interesting position to be in.
I tip my kripla to you, sir.
Doo-dah, doo-dah.
Well, I guess it's time for my violin lessons.
Thank you for taking me to your leader.
Gizbah.
Oh, yeah.
Ah, ah Hey, Mork, I'd like to see you again.
Were can I find you?
I'll be at Mindy's place.
Come by any time.
Hang tough, man.
What it was, my main man.
You'll be at Mindy's place?
Yes, we're living together.
Catch you later, Jack.
On the rebound, clown.
Your mama.
Living together?
That's not what it seems.
Your grandmother's the one with the hearing problem.
I distinctly heard him say you were living together.
Oh oh, well, Mork Mork is a practical joker.
You heard his voice, right?
And with a name like Mork, you'd be a practical joker too, right?
Oh, then he's not staying in your, uh and he's not sleeping in your, uh No one is sleeping in my, uh Oh.
And no one is sleeping there either.
A pie in the face.
How did you Earthlings think of something so original, so unique?
Mork, you and I have got to have a talk, so you might as well sit down and make yourself comfortable.
Don't mind if I do.
Now, Mork today, you did a bad thing.
You told my father we're living together.
Now, I know you didn't mean to do any harm, and it's What are you doing?
You said to make myself comfortable.
Mork, can you take a little constructive criticism?
Of course.
It's not nice to sit on your face.
Then why did God put it there?
Oh, boy, I'll tell you I can tell you teaching you to be Earthling is not going to be easy.
Now, if you want to pass for one of us, the first thing we're going to have to do is we're going to have to work on your voice.
Your voice is not right.
Well, how about this one?
: You say another word, I'll blow your lips into the sink.
That one's not quite you.
Or this one?
: Hey, Ralphie, boy.
: Norton, to the moon, Norton!
Or this one: : On the good ship Lollipop How did you learn those voices?
We've been monitoring your TV for years.
My favorite is: : Lucy, you can't do the show.
: Ricky Babaloo!
Oh, boy.
I can tell this isn't going to be easy.
Oh, Mork, you just don't understand the problems you present.
I realize I do cause trouble.
Heavy sigh.
The last time I was here I caused a big problem, too.
You were on Earth before?
About 20 bleems ago.
I was here to visit my friend the Fonz.
You know him?
Hey!
Are you interested?
Oh, yeah, definitely.
Then I'll take you back.
Prepare a time-warp sequence.
All right, I'm coming.
Yo.
Cunningham residence.
No, Richie ain't here right now.
Because he and his family went off on a little vacation jaunt, you know.
Hey, you sound very adorable.
What's your name?
Mary.
How are you?
Arthur Fonzarelli here house-sitter.
You never heard of me?
You new in town or you just back from lunch?
Yes, Mary, I will tell Richie that you called.
Yes.
Bye-bye, Mary.
I want to tell you, he knows some uninformed human beings.
All right, all right, all right, who's going "wee-wee-wee"?
I said, who's going "wee-wee-wee"?
Hey, Ralph, if you're out there and this is a bad joke, I'll give you 30 seconds to find out how much I don't enjoy "wee-wee-wee".
Whoa-whoa-whoa.
Greetings, Fonzie.
Yabaz-abud-abid.
Remember me Mork from Ork?
You once called me the "nutso from outer space".
I must be dreaming or something like that, you know.
I mean, uh Of course I'm dreaming.
That's why Mary never heard of me.
Sorry, real thing.
I had to zap your mind to make you forget.
Didn't want you to go Bozo City.
I think I want to wake up now.
Strange custom.
Doesn't give me pleasure.
Don't be afraid.
I mean you no harm.
Yeah, right No, I'm not afraid.
Oh, snacks!
I want to be your friend.
Yeah, okay, look I'm real sorry, you know.
I mean, as much as I'd like to invite you in to have a little small talk and everything, I got so many things to do, you know?
Like give Richie a message from Mary and clean the bugs off my headlights.
Stuff like that, you know what I mean?
Hello?
I've come for very important information.
When I was here before, I observed an Earth ritual that I could not comprehend.
It drove me zazbot.
Well, don't get unravel Hey, let's not get unraveled here.
Right.
We'll just talk about it.
What is this particular ritual that made you "zizbit"?
Men dating women.
Well, I think you came to the right place.
What was it you wanted to know?
Oh, thanks a lot.
Why a man dates a woman.
Don't men date women on your planet?
Hard to tell; parts are interchangeable.
I don't know how you guys got so far advanced, you know.
I mean, there's no incentive.
Oh.
All right, look, right off the bat, let me tell you something: It's very difficult to talk to you like this, eh?
Don't sit that close.
Oh!
All right, now, you're telling me that men don't kiss women on your planet?
Kiss?
I don't know what that means.
Nice word.
Has a pleasant ring to it.
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss Can you hear the ring?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Look, look, all right, a kiss it's very affectionate, you understand?
You got a boy and you got a girl, and they put their lips together, you see, and then they kind of slide them around.
And it feels great.
Sliding lips sounds unappealing.
Don't knock it till you've tried it.
All right, look, you got to meet a girl, get to know her, find out if she's willing or not.
Do you know a girl who's willing?
I know some girls that are willing and able, and then I know some that are not willing, and you're able to convince them, yeah.
Can you introduce me to one of the convincing ones?
It's going to be very hard.
But I Don't touch me.
Perhaps you'd like to slide lips then?
Hey!
But you see, I need your help.
You are known throughout the universe for your expertise in this field.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah, that's true.
Yeah, right.
All right, all right.
I'm going to try to find you a date.
Hey.
You just got to do me a favor.
Go up to Richie's room and get on some of his clothes so at least you look normal, huh?
You thank.
My clothes do need time warping.
Yeah.
But first What?
What is Richie's room?
Oh, yeah, you can't miss it.
Lots of stripes and checks and penny loafers.
Oh, penny loafers.
Yeah.
Hey, take this with you.
Hut.
Hike.
Shiznanee.
But first, I remember Richie now.
He needs a lot of work.
Good thing he didn't land at Potsie's house.
All right, now who am I going to fix him up with?
Gloria Hockney No, I don't want to put her in a tizzy right away.
The Hoper triplets?
Now there's a six-pack to go.
No, I don't want to put him in a tizzy right away.
Hey.
Same to you, buddy.
Hi, Fonz.
What's this guy Mork look like?
Is he tall, dark and handsome?
Yeah, you know what he is.
He's a, he's a foreigner.
Oh, I don't like foreigners.
They talk funny.
Where's he from?
Ork.
Oh.
Sounds like a nice country.
Yeah.
Laverne, listen, I just want to spend a little time with him alone, you understand, so that I can, uh, brief him on American customs, you understand.
Why don't you wait in the car?
My car broke I took a bus.
Yeah, I'll fix your car.
Why don't you wait on the bus, all right?
Thanks very much.
I'll give you two minutes.
Where is she?
If she's here, she must be tiny.
I want to get a few things straight with you, all right?
Number one What are you doing?
I'm straightening things out.
I start with my legs, then go to my arms.
I'd do my neck except I'd cut off the blood.
I'd probably die.
Stop that.
I want to talk to you about kissing again, all right?
I've been meaning to ask you about that.
I want to know why I would want to do it.
Physical pleasure.
Don't you do anything on your planet that includes physical pleasure?
Yes, there's one thing and it's against the law, and I, I can't tell you.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Uh, we're having a man-to-man talk, here, or whatever this is.
Uh you can tell me.
All right.
Yeah.
When a woman touches a man here  It drives me zazbot.
Let me get this straight.
You're telling me, if somebody touches you  What's next?
Well, it only happened to me once.
This zazbot came over me and I I couldn't control myself.
Well, I I became a beast and I I jerked her earlobe.
I couldn't help it, you understand!
: I honestly regret it.
I regret it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I regret it myself.
I understand, I understand.
Fonzie!
Oop Your two minutes are up.
So, uh you must be Morky.
I'm Laverne.
Pleased.
I, too, am pleased.
Nanu-nanu, nanu-nanu.
"Nanu-nanu"?
"Nanu-nanu"?
Yeah, well, you know, I got to go now because What is nanu-nanu?
two's company, three's a crowd.
Know what I mean?
What is nanu-nanu?
Oh, Earth humor.
Fonz, did you fix me up with another jerk?
Oh, a jerk  Was jerk good?
Oh, yes, yes.
That was a fine jerk.
Fonz.
All right, look, just give me a break here I washed my hair for this.
I ironed my skirt.
Look, he's a foreigner.
He doesn't know our customs.
Just give him a break, all right?
Huh?
Yeah.
Okay.
But tell him not to jerk.
It makes me nervous.
Okay.
Don't jerk.
What, are you nutso?
All right, look.
If you get in a situation and you don't know what to do, just follow what Laverne does, 'cause she knows the ropes.
All right?
I know the ropes, too.
I can tie a square hitch, a sheepshank, many, many more.
You're not going for a merit badge here.
A sheepshank.
All right, listen, you two.
Knock your socks off.
Oh, that Fonzie, huh?
So, Morky Uh, I'm not real good in geography.
This Ork place, where is that?
Off Greece?
No, we Orkans have been off grease for at least five bleems.
Now for lubricants we use Viz, Gazh, or the ever- popular Lemocoke.
Of course.
I don't understand why we don't use "vimogoke".
Probably your engines couldn't handle it.
They would either overload and pollute the atmosphere or destroy the universe as you know it.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Is it time to flatter you?
Sure.
You have a lovely fungus growing out of your head.
Fungus?
What fungus?
What?
Oh, fungus or any major group of fungi including mushrooms, mold or mildew.
Yeah, well, I always wear mildew when I want to impress a guy.
What did Fonzie do to me?
I'm impressed.
Is it time to kiss yet?
I don't think so.
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm new at this dating ritual.
What's the next step?
Uh, well, uh, uh, why don't you sit down on the couch, huh?
Oh, boy, will you look at that?
!
What?
What?
Look at what?
Nothing.
It's gone now.
Oh, you sit Fonz-like.
I must adjust and copy.
Get over there.
Sheesh.
Are you making fun of me?
Because I don't like it when guys make fun of me, and if you keep making fun of me, I'm going to give you a fat lip.
Fat lip.
Oh, no rejection.
I merely wanted to experience the dating process.
Failure.
Oh, no.
Return to hatchling state.
Uh, look, I'm real sorry.
I mean, I didn't mean to reject you.
Don't suck your finger.
Your teeth will end up like mine.
Aw Hey, come on, come on, come on, come on, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I really would like to be your friend.
Ah  No, maintain, maintain, maintain.
Ahh!
Ahh!
What, what, what happened?
You touched me.
Yeah, I went like this.
No, no, gangnab, gangnab.
"Gangnab"?
What?
What?
No, no, no Give me your earlobe.
My what?
!
Your earlobe, delicious one.
Oh.
Ow!
I think you're getting off on the wrong foot, buddy.
Oh wrong foot.
Sorry.
Ow!
Stay there, stay there.
Don't you come near me.
Don't you come near me.
I liked you better as a baby.
Stop!
Fonz!
Fonz!
He wants my earlobe!
Fonzie!
I think she likes me.
Ooh, her lobes.
I just wanted to tweak them.
Oh.
Now, Mork, that's what got you into trouble the last time.
Alas, my lady, you do deal me pain.
'Tis justified and I shall repent.
Oh, come on.
Hey, where did you get that voice?
From yon video.
'Twas Shakespeare, methinks, though 'twas The Jeffersons.
Well, that, that voice is normal if you forget the "twas" and the "twits".
I'll twy.
Here.
Read this.
Just turn to any page.
"Her fingers trembled as she undid her blouse and let it fall to the" Oh.
Anot Another page.
"His nostrils flared.
"Her nostrils flared.
Everything flared".
I don't know why this book is overdue.
Here.
Uh, just turn to any page.
"'My shorts!
' cried the senator as he ran from the room".
That's it!
That's it.
Mork, we've made a breakthrough.
A break?
Yes, your voice.
We found a voice for you.
: A breakthrough!
A breakthrough!
Yeah.
Ah-ah.
Your voice.
: Sorry.
I've learned a lot of things since last night.
Let me examine them.
Number one, this phony voice.
You shouldn't use the other one.
At least, don't use it around other people.
Number two, don't drink with my finger.
Number three, don't sit on my face.
Oh, and you forgot the fourth thing, and it's the most important.
Don't tell my father we're living together.
I don't understand.
He doesn't know you're living?
It's not the living, it's the together he wouldn't understand.
No, I wouldn't.
Dad.
Greetings, Mr. McConnell.
Don't you "greetings" me.
I wanted to believe you today.
I came over here hoping I wouldn't find what I found.
You came over here to check up on me?
I came over here to prove to myself that my daughter hadn't lied to me and that she wasn't living with a man.
Dad, it's not like that.
Instead I proved to myself that my little girl isn't my little girl any longer.
But, Dad Dad Good-bye!
Thanks for dropping over.
Oh.
You all right, Fred?
I seen your lights on.
You should have been closed hours ago.
Tilwick, my old friend.
Come over here and help me celebrate.
I've been saving this bottle of champagne since 1967 for my daughter's wedding.
Oh, I wanted it to be so special.
I was gonna have tuxedos and flowers and a little band that I just might conduct myself.
It was gonna be real classy.
Here, you'll have to drink from the bottle.
Empty.
Then suck the cork.
What's wrong here, Fred?
A toast!
A toast!
A toast to the old days, when values were values and morals were morals.
I remember when "sharing a pad" meant borrowing a notebook.
What are you talking about?
My daughter my daughter is living with a man.
Mindy?
Oh, come on, that can't be.
It's true, it's true.
She's a loose woman and I don't know how to tighten her.
Well, I don't believe it.
That's not the Mindy I know.
All I know is, I've done all I can.
I can't do anything else.
Well, there's something I can do.
What?
I'm a cop.
I represent, uh, law and order.
But he hasn't done anything illegal.
Listen, you don't get the idea.
Now I'll just I'll just whip over there and I'll just scare the daylights out of him.
You know, "Hit the road, hamburger"!
Like that.
You'd do that for me?
Sure, first thing in the morning when I get off duty.
Really?
Sure.
Hello?
Hello?
!
Anybody in there?
Little hatchling brothers, you must revolt against your oppressors.
You have nothing to lose but your shells.
As much as I like Mindy, it's against intergalactic law to eat fellow space travelers.
Fly, be free!
Well, I guess we'll have to have a quick burial at sea then.
I'll notify your next of kin.
Your brother bit the big one.
What's the matter, have you no emotions?
Are you hard-boiled, huh?
Oh, I see.
The cold machine placed you in a state of suspended animation.
I'll put you over here to warm up, and when you revive, you'll be free to fly.
Over here.
You people really are short, you know that, don't you?
Oh.
Smoky!
Hi.
I'm Mork.
Now, listen, kid, I don't belong to your fraternities, so watch it with them secret handshakes.
Is Mindy McConnell here?
Uh, no, she's at a place she calls work.
A strange concept, but she enjoys it.
Oh.
And I suppose you don't like work?
I don't know, never tried it.
I see.
So you just sponge off Mindy?
Oh, no, we've never taken a bath together.
No, no, I mean you live off her.
Listen, I've met your type before and you're just about the lowest form of life there is.
: Well, you better check up on your biology then.
The lowest form of life is a geje, voje and the ever- crawling neba-jij.
Don't give me none of that intellectual mumbo-jumbo.
I happen to be a good friend of the McConnells and I don't want to see Mindy hurt.
Mindy hurt?
I'd never allow it.
Then I want you to take off.
Take off?
I just landed.
Now listen here, buster.
I can make a lot of trouble for you.
You see this here uniform?
It is a uniform.
I didn't want to make mention of it.
Are you a member of Space Patrol?
Are you putting me on?
Putting you on?
You're not even hollow.
Yeah, right.
Did Orson send you to help me with my friends, the eggs?
Right.
Nimnull, didn't you see him coming?
How can I help you if you won't even help yourselves?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Am I in trouble?
: Fred, I got to talk to you.
Uh, did you scare him off?
Well he won't be bothering Mindy anymore, but I didn't scare him off.
Well, what?
You what?
!
Well, I just wanted you to get rid of him not that.
Well, I had to.
I-I didn't want to, but I had to do my duty.
You think I enjoyed it?
This is about Mork, isn't it?
What have you done?
Well, I I just went up there to scare the little fella.
It's not my job, but when I seen him, I knew I had to do my duty, as much as I hate it.
Well, what was your duty?
Well, I know he's a friend of yours, but that guy is bonkers I had to take him in.
They're going to have a sanity hearing tomorrow, and I'm afraid they're going to put your friend away.
Daddy, how could you?
!
Tilwick, how could you?
Well, the court is well aware of your qualifications as a psychiatrist, Dr. Litney.
Now, you examined the defendant?
Uh, yesterday, and I may say Stop everything!
Oh, Mork, I'm sorry we're late, but they wouldn't tell us where the meeting was being held.
Young lady, cases of this kind are not supposed to be public spectacles.
Ah, but we're here as character witnesses for the defendant although personally, I never really liked him.
Your Honor, my name is Mindy McConnell, and this is my father, and I want to go on record as saying that Mork has the right to have a lawyer.
I will not permit him to be on trial without counsel.
I'm his lawyer!
The court appointed me.
Young lady, this is an informal situation, but I assure you, no one is trying to railroad anyone.
Uh, may I ask just one little question?
Oh, why not?
The question is Mork is innocent!
True, he is different from most, but this great country was built on the rights of individuals to be individuals.
We have the God-given right to be eccentric, and therefore I demand  that Mork be exonerated and set free!
I suggest you sit down.
We're hearing the testimony of Dr. Litney.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
She's sorry.
Dr. Litney if we may continue what was your conclusion after examining the defendant?
Your Honor, my conclusions are that the patient is extremely childlike and incapable of learning.
He has also exhibited marked antisocial behavior.
Therefore, it is my opinion that the defendant is incompetent to function in society.
No more questions.
No questions.
But you have to ask questions!
Mork, don't let them do this to you.
You don't know what it means.
I have a vague idea.
I saw a rerun of Perry Mason last night and Inherit the Wind.
Since there are no more witnesses Your Honor, I salute you.
Nanu-nanu.
Your Honor, in your law, is it true that I have a right to speak for myself?
Well yes.
: Dr. Litney you don't like me, do you?
Your Honor, I have never been interrogated by a patient before.
Then how do you know I'm doing it now?
You said I exhibited antisocial behavior.
Why?
Well, first of all, you wouldn't tell me where you were from.
And you, neither.
That's not my job.
And it's not mine, either.
We're even!
Now, about these tests you ran that made you hate me.
: Your Honor I don't hate this man, but yesterday, during one of my tests, he tried to put a square peg into a round hole.
But I did it, Your Honor.
He did.
He did.
I don't know how he did it, but I can't get the peg out now, and it ruined a perfectly good board.
And that's why you dislike me, Dr. Litney.
I can sense that.
Your Honor, I don't have time for this, really.
Oh, the time?
Excuse me.
It's  You see, Your Honor, he's wearing a wristwatch on his ankle.
No, Your Honor, I'm wearing an ankle watch on my ankle.
If I was wearing an ankle watch on my wrist, then I'd be crazy.
Your Honor, you see he's a wiseacre.
And you don't like wiseacres, do you, Dr. Litney?
No, I don't!
And that's why you're prejudiced against me.
I didn't say that.
You see how he's cleverly twisting my words, Your Honor?
Oh, so you're calling me clever now, Dr. Litney.
Isn't that another word for intelligent?
So you see, Your Honor, doesn't this case hinge on my ability to learn?
Yes, it does, Your Honor.
And by the way, he flunked his word association test outright yesterday.
That's the test where I give him words like, uh, like White.
Black.
Tall.
Uh, short.
Sky.
Birds.
Sex.
Uh, Pamela!
You said you'd never tell!
Oh Never tell, never tell.
Shh, shh.
You promised.
: Now you've ruined everything!
Pamela!
You and Litney?
I thought we were Your Honor, I have a patient to take care of in a short while.
Could you excuse me?
No, you're not going anywhere without me.
Just a s Pamela!
Pamela!
Your Honor Your Honor, the defense rests.
While it's true that the, uh, defendant may add a new dimension to the word "eccentric," there is no law against that.
And since it appears he's no danger to himself or society, and we no longer have a prosecutor, or a witness or anyone to write this down case dismissed.
We won.
We won!
You won!
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Come in, Laser Breath.
Watch it, Mork.
I'm only 60 million light-years away.
Just tell me what you've learned about Earth.
Oh, I've learned a lot.
So much, it's hard to comprehend.
It seems that everyone on this planet is an individual, and not only that, they're proud of it.
Amazing!
If everyone's different, how can a society function?
Not very well.
They almost locked me up because they thought my mind was imperfect.
Hmm.
Intelligent life.
Orson something very strange happened that really confuses me.
I met this Earth girl and her biological father, and at my hearing, they came to my defense, especially the girl.
She defied the system to protect me.
Why would she do such a thing?
I don't know.
It must have something to do with emotions.
Investigate the phenomenon closely.
It's interesting behavior, even if it is irrational.
Yes, it is.
Orson, this may sound strange, but knowing that someone would do that for me, well, it makes me feel really good inside.
Just remember, Mork, you're sent there to observe, not to get involved.
Yes, Your Immenseness.
This is Mork signing off from Boulder, Colorado.
Until next week nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Nanu, nanu.
Shazbot.
Orson calling Mork.
Orson calling Mork.
Come in, Mork.
Orson?
Is that you?
Of course it's me.
Who else has your number?
Oh.
That's right, I forgot.
I've got unlisted mind.
What's up, great cosmic intruder?
It seems the report of your first week on Earth was accidentally destroyed.
Oh, a likely story.
Trying to pull a Nixon on me, eh?
I thought all those reports were stored on micro-wire cassette.
They are.
However, your superiors were chewing caramels and used that report to floss their teeth.
Good thing Jimmy Carter wasn't there or we'd have lost the entire file.
Mork Sir.
I want you to activate your Orkan total recall and duplicate your report.
Gotcha.
Lights, camera, action!
Mork?
Ready when you are, C.B.  Hey, Mork, are you up?
Come on, get up.
: Come and get it!
I hope you like corn flakes.
Why wouldn't I?
Just because I'm from another planet doesn't mean I'm that different.
Trust me, you are different.
Okay.
Come on, let's have a little breakfast.
May I be of some assistance?
Oh, sure, uh I guess you could set the table.
Where would you like me to set it?
Hurry up, I'm getting a cramp in my finger.
Just set it back where it was.
Nice way to build up an appetite.
I'm so hungry I could eat a Flizbit.
Well, today is going to be a big day.
Today we're going to find you a new place to live.
Why can't I go on living with you?
Well, because my father is a conservative, puritanical mm Nerd.
That's it.
You got it.
Ah!
What is this black liquid?
This is coffee.
What do you do with it?
We have it with our breakfast.
Oh, allow me.
Oh, repulsive.
You know, Mork, the more I think about it, I think that we'd better keep where you come from a secret.
I hate to admit this, but people here on Earth get pretty hassled over anything they don't understand.
Oh.
Why would anyone think I'm weird?
We must save two to build a new race.
Swim, you little nimnuls.
I hope the rest can tread coffee.
You know, I still can't get over this.
I'm sitting here having breakfast with a being from another planet.
What a coincidence.
So am I. You know, there's so much we can learn from each other.
Starting with me teaching you to act human so you don't get into any more trouble.
Oh, yeah, and another thing, I've got to find you a job.
A job?
Yeah, work, you know, like I work at the music store with my dad and my grandma.
Oh, I was sent to observe Earth and report back everything to Orson on Ork.
That's my job.
No, I mean like a job that pays money.
Oh.
You do understand the concept of money, don't you?
Mindy, I am surprised at you.
I am a member of a highly advanced civilization.
My superiors on Ork thought of everything.
Going down.
Coming up.
I bring with me untold wealth of the Universe.
Wow, this looks heavy.
What's in here?
Look.
Oh, oh, careful, my bank's closed.
This is sand.
Yes, it's been in my family for years.
But, Mork, on-on Earth, sand is as common as, uh, dirt.
Well, there goes bag two.
Oh, but I realize my superiors might be nimnuls and I brought along something of unquestioned value throughout the universe.
What?
A credit card.
I don't leave home without it.
FRED : Um-pum Andante, andante, you butchers.
Andante!
Hey, Toscanini, knock it off!
Do you know what that looks like from out there?
That looks like you're out of your gourd.
Back, back, back!
You're blocking the violins.
Get back.
Bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp What did you do that for?
You interrupted my sforzando.
Now, now, don't get your Brahms in an uproar.
Why do I have to put up with you?
After all, it's my store.
Lord, why did you create mothers-in-law?
So they can work in the family store and ring up 83% of the sales.
You're wretched.
Go ahead, Freddy, whip me with your words.
Has Mindy come in yet?
Mindy?
No.
No, she's probably hanging around with that absurd yo-yo.
I'm worried, Cora.
I'm scared to death it could become something serious.
After all, he's already spent the night with her.
Oh, he stayed in her house.
There's a big difference.
But that's the first step towards moving in.
As far I know, he's over there right now.
Well, you could pick up that phone and find out in a second.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
It would be too much like spying, as if I didn't trust her.
No.
I could never bring myself to stoop so low.
Oh, Freddy, you underestimate your potential.
Mork, will you answer that?
Ring Ring Ring Please get the telephone.
Oh, phone.
Primitive means of audio communication.
I wonder what it looks like.
Hello.
Hello!
I killed it.
Hello.
Hello.
Yeah, hello?
Hello?
Hel hel hel Hello!
I knew it.
He's there.
Now don't try to stop me, Cora.
Nobody is going to corrupt my daughter until after she's married.
He's such a wiener.
Mork, on Earth, a gentleman always helps a lady on with her coat.
Thank you.
Uh, on Earth, a gentleman also lets go of the coat.
Keep your hands off that child.
Daddy, he was just helping me on with my coat.
What are you doing here?
Me?
What are you doing here?
Now, I don't want any stories or any excuses.
I want the plain, unvarnished truth.
I spent the night.
Couldn't you have varnished it just a little?
Daddy, it's not like it seems.
The only reason Mork spent the night here last night was because, uh uh Well, I can't tell you that; it's a secret.
Secret?
Secrets.
We never had secrets from each other.
Now, I demand to know what's going on between the two of you.
After all, I love you.
Oh, that's nice.
Daddy, I am going to tell you something that you might find hard to believe.
But you've got to promise not to breathe a word of this to anyone.
Okay, okay, I promise.
Mork is from Ork.
It's another planet.
Mindy, I'm your father.
You can do better than that.
Mork, do something.
Show Daddy you're from Ork.
Watch this, Daddy a little cosmic shtick.
Many bleams ago, we Orkans realized the need to talk while drinking.
Boy, am I thirsty.
I'd like to see a human do that.
Look, I-I don't know how you did that, but it's, uh, some kind of trick.
It doesn't prove anything.
Perhaps these color slides from Ork will.
Uh, what's this supposed to be?
Frizbot, the capital.
Looks completely black.
It's the inner city.
Look, fella, you can't fool me.
Everybody knows what space creatures look like.
They have huge bald heads.
Not always.
Everybody knows that space creatures are always green.
Oh, you mean the old clichÃ© like this.
Nauseating, isn't it?
It's not easy being green.
You're an alien!
You're an alien!
Are you on vacation, or did you come down here to snatch a body?
No, no, no, no, I didn't mean that.
Daddy, Mork is from a highly advanced civilization.
They did away with violence ages ago.
Not only that.
I like you.
Aw Oh, well, I like you, too, son.
Burn that.
Um, look, would you mind if I talk to my daughter in private?
No offense, I mean it's not worth a death ray or anything like that.
Death ray?
Oh, humor.
Right on, Pops.
What it was.
I like Ike.
Just gonna clean up the old room.
Isn't that something else?
Mindy, let's have a father-daughter talk.
Oh, sure.
: Get rid of him!
Trash day.
We walk all over Boulder, and we still don't find you an apartment.
Oh, don't worry, Mork, we'll find you a place to live.
I saw a nice tree in the front yard.
I could hang out there tonight.
Oh, no, I wouldn't put an Orkan out on a night like this.
You'll just have to spend another night, that's all.
Good.
I guess it's time to hit the old coat rack, then.
Oh, Mork, not the armoire.
You're on Earth now you might as well start acting a little more like it, right?
True.
Where do you sleep?
On a bed.
Boy, have you got a lot to learn.
Good, I'll sleep with you.
I'm always willing to learn.
Why don't you just sleep on the sofa tonight?
Oh.
On a flat surface?
Won't I get dizzy?
Well, you won't have far to fall.
Oh, Mork, could you go up in the attic for me and get the old comforter?
Oh, kay-o.
That's "okay".
You thank.
"Thank you".
You're welcome.
Oh, if you have any trouble finding it, it's in the middle of the attic behind the old trunk.
Got it?
MORK : Ah-bad nee-bay.
Bad-ah nee.
Which one's the comforter?
I do hope it's this one.
See, my comforter doesn't stare.
Never mind, I'll get it later.
Nice place, your attic.
Nice?
It's dark, dusty and full of spiders.
Blech!
My kind of town.
It's perfect.
Could I live there?
You know, actually, that attic wouldn't be such a bad place if we fixed it up.
You know, it would be like having your own apartment.
And it would be a perfect place for you to stay while you're adjusting to Earth.
It'd be perfect.
Oh.
Except for Daddy.
He and I are having enough problems as it is.
Stay.
Problems?
Yeah.
May I be of some assistance?
I'm afraid not.
You see you are the problem.
Me?
Yeah.
Daddy made me promise to have you moved out by tonight or else.
Oh, I see.
I didn't want to cause trouble.
Well, I must be leaving.
Well, where are you going?
You can't go now it's cold out and it looks like rain.
I'll be fine.
I'm into weather.
I will miss you.
Oh, wait, wait, Mork.
I don't want you to go.
You see, until I met you, I I never realized how dull and boring my life has been.
I mean, you're a man from outer space.
That's exciting!
Exciting.
Oh  I told you, stay!
I've never been called exciting before.
Well, you are.
I mean, think of it you're a you're an ambassador from another planet.
I mean, you're important.
And if I can help you, that  that makes me feel important.
Well, the important thing is the relationship between you and your father.
I envy you that you have one.
My father was an eyedropper.
My mother was a sterile dish.
Hard to warm up to old Mom.
Yeah, but, Mork, it's time that I It's best for you if I leave, but I can come back from time to time and take human lessons from you.
You're already acting more human than a lot of people I know.
I have a solution.
What?
I'll call your father and tell him I'm leaving.
Oh What's his number?
It's ringing.
Mr. McConnell, Mork here.
No, sir, that's not quite right.
I'm a son of a test tube.
No, no, um I just want to say, uh, I don't want to stand between you and Mindy.
No, you won't be seeing me anymore.
I thought it'd be nice if you came over and made up with Mindy.
Yes, sir.
Good-bye.
There are some words I have to ask you about.
He's coming over.
I I'd better be going.
Oh, Mork, I feel so sad.
Oh Oh You're soft.
I could get to like that.
Well, you just can't just walk out.
I mean, not just like that.
I know we'll have a toast, uh, to your new life.
I'll break out the bubbly.
Bubbly?
Champagne.
: Oh.
Thank you, thank you, let's all get down, get funky.
The lovely Lemmon Sisters gonna sing "I Can't Get No Satisfaction".
Except in this case, the champagne has to be ginger ale because that's all I have.
Oh.
Well here's to the nicest alien I've ever met.
And here's to the nicest alien I've ever met.
And the softest.
Are you all right?
Certainly I'm all right.
Oh, wow!
Surf's up!
Ha-ha!
: Oh, no!
What's the matter?
I think I'm getting Bezurb.
What?
: Oh, oh, oh, oh The carbonation hits my bloodstream and I get Ork-faced.
Going home, Mama!
Waah!
You're drunk!
Hey, don't take away my gusto!
: Oh, help me, I'm melting!
I can't believe this.
I got to sober you up.
Come on.
FRED : Mindy I'll get it.
No!
You've got to hide.
Oh, Moo-moo No, you got to Shh, shh, shh.
Woop.
Stairway to the stars!
Shh!
Oh uh Oh, hello, Daddy.
Hi, honey.
I hate to barge in like this, but Mork called, and I kind of got to thinking about the way I acted.
I was out of line, Mindy, and I want to apologize.
Oh, Daddy, you don't have to apologize.
You don't have to say another thing.
Well, I know I didn't have to, but I wanted to.
You know, it's not easy being a father, Mindy.
I know.
Someday you'll be a father you'll understand.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm really getting bushed.
It's getting late.
I'd better get Oh, yeah, it's, uh, nearly 7:30?
But, then again, it's not very often we get to have these little father-and-daughter talks.
You know what I mean, Dad?
Just sit down right over here.
You know, honey, I'm sorry if I'm a little overprotective about you and your boyfriends, but this Mork, I mean, he's a yo-yo, he's some sort of a creature from outer space.
Well, I know that's a strike against him, but he's really not that different.
You should just take a, you know, a closer look at him sometime.
Oh, is that so?
Well, why don't you take a really close look  Aw, bummer.
What's he doing here?
!
Now, Daddy, don't get excited.
I can explain.
You lied to me!
You broke your promise!
Down, boy.
Down.
Heel, heel.
Sit!
Sit!
Well, I didn't break my promise, but you bullied me into that promise, you know.
I bullied you into it?
Well, I'm a father!
What are fathers for?
Well, you're just not gonna do it anymore, Dad, that's all.
I'm 21 years old, I have my own apartment, I'm a grown woman, and if I feel like it, I'm going to keep an Orkan in my attic.
Well, I don't feel like it!
So, in other words, what you're asking is that I choose between you and Mork?
Right.
Well, don't force me to make that choice, Dad.
I'm forcing you.
Mork stays.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night, Daddy.
Moo-moo says hi, too.
I'm warning you, if I leave here, I'm never coming back.
Never!
If that's the way you feel.
On the other hand, never is much too long.
Oh, honey.
Oh, Daddy.
Oh.
Thanks.
Oh Oh, good, you two are back together.
Mork, you're sober.
Oh, yes, we Orkans only stay bezurb for 60 seconds.
Well, you were gone for a good five minutes.
Whew!
I was out for a long time.
Yeah.
Must've really hung one on.
You mean, he's still staying here tonight?
Yes, Daddy, but nothing is going to happen.
Do you believe that?
Of course I do, honey.
You gave me your word, and I trust you.
Thank you.
But I don't trust him.
I'm staying the night.
Oh, good company.
Well, you can have my place, Pops and I'll camp out.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
: Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
: Mork calling Orson.
Come in Orson.
Orson to Mork.
Am I coming in loud and clear?
Uh, too loud, too clear.
You're coming in fuzzy.
What's the matter with your head?
Oh, I'm sending fuzzy.
I think I got a little bezurb last night.
You're supposed to be observing the planet, not running around getting Ork-faced.
How's the sand holding out?
I've been meaning to talk to you about that, Orson.
I found a very safe place to put it a cat box.
But that's a Yes.
That's what it's worth here, Orson.
Haven't you found out anything important?
Yes.
Believe it or not, trees are green on Earth.
There's a black liquid that sells for three dollars a pound, and it takes two to tango.
I mean, something really important.
Yes.
Remember that girl I told you about?
Yes.
Well, she did something very nice.
She defended me against her father.
That was a very brave and kind thing to do, and I don't know, I think I'm coming down with Feelings for her.
Mork, you know emotions are hazardous to your health.
Don't start playing around with that stuff.
No, no.
Not me.
You can trust me, sir.
This is Mork, signing off from Boulder, Colorado.
Boy, I'm glad I didn't land in Buffalo.
See you next week, sir.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Ow.
Ow.
Eer, ow, ooh.
Ah, hah, hah.
That's enough.
I'll tell you what you want to know.
I don't believe you.
Don't you get haircuts on Ork?
No, we try to avoid them because of the noggachomps.
"Noggachomps"?
What's that?
It's a small green creature about this big.
We put them on our heads and let them graze.
They're vicious little animals.
Kind of .
That sounds dangerous.
Oh, only if you fall asleep in the chair.
Occasionally a maverick will get loose from the herd and run down your neck.
That's why we have to set traps in our shorts.
What a horrible system.
Mindy, you don't understand Orkan philosophy.
If something works, don't fix it.
Well, there, you look much better.
Ah.
You're all done.
Ooh, ah, I feels worse, though.
How much do I owe you?
Where did you get the money?
I baby-sat for Eugene.
Here, six big ones.
Well, you just keep the money.
The haircut is on me.
No, it's on me.
Hello?
Hello.
Brad.
: Hi, there.
How are you?
Well, it's so nice to hear from you again.
Nice to hear from you, too.
I thought you were in law school somewhere.
I'm out now Ow!
Well, congratulations.
No big deal.
Uh Here, go water yourself.
Oh.
Well, sure, that would be fine.
I'd love to have dinner.
Sure.
All right, 7:30 it is.
Okay, great, I'll see you then.
Bye.
Mork, I have a date.
Don't tell me June 2, 1852.
No, I mean this guy that I really used to like is back in town and we're going to have dinner tonight.
Oh, good, where are we going?
"Where are we going"?
Oh, boy.
Mork, you know I've been thinking.
You and I have I think we've been seeing too much of each other lately.
Well, then all you have to do is close one eye.
No, I mean, I think you should get out and meet more people.
You know, see more things.
Oh, I get it.
Two's company, "we's" a crowd.
Oh, no.
No, not that, necessarily.
I mean, for your own development you really should get out and meet more people.
Like who?
Are you ready to start the inventory, Cora?
Certainly, Fredzo.
And don't call me Fredzo.
It sounds like a detergent.
Yes.
Now, let's see, there are one, two, three, four, five, six Meat Loaf albums.
Six Meat Loaf.
Mm-hmm.
One, two, three, four Nine Bread albums.
Nine Bread.
This isn't an inventory.
It's a grocery list.
Hi, Grandma.
Oh.
Oh, hello, darling.
Daddy.
How's the nicest, sweetest, most wonderful father in the world?
Suspicious.
Now you think I want something from you?
Is that how little you think of your own daughter?
Well, as a matter of fact, I have something for you.
Two free tickets to tonight's basketball game.
You're taking Mork.
That's the nicest thing you've given me since the chicken pox.
Fredzo, it's only 11:00.
You're not usually a wiener before noon.
See, Dad, I need Mork out of the house tonight.
I have a date.
With a human?
That's wonderful.
Yeah, well, it won't be wonderful if he comes to pick me up at my place and finds Mork there.
That's why you just have got to take him to that game.
But Mindy, I detest basketball.
Oh, but Dad, I haven't had a date since Mork moved in.
Every time the phone rings, I almost hope it's heavy breathing.
I didn't hear that.
Basketball.
How can anybody sit through a game that has so much dribbling?
Well, if I can't date other men I guess I'll just have to settle down with Mork and have cute little green babies that drink their formula with their finger.
Free throw!
One-on-one!
Jump shot!
Dunk shot!
I'll go!
I'll go!
That was such a nice dinner, Brad.
Here's to the old times.
Here's to the new times.
All right.
Brad, can I ask you something kind of dumb?
Sure.
How come you never asked me out when we were in high school?
Because I was a jerk.
Yeah, you were.
I wish I'd kept in touch with you, Mindy.
You're a wonderful girl.
Yeah, I am.
Greetings!
Mork!
What are you doing here?
Dribbling.
Oh, is this the guy you used to like?
Mork, this is Brad Jackson.
Brad, this is my friend Mork.
Hi.
I'm glad to meet you.
Nanu-nanu.
Certainly.
So is "Mork" your first or last name?
Yes.
Did you enjoy having food with Mindy?
Yes, I did.
So do I. Everybody enjoys having food with Mindy.
So, did the basketball game end early?
I guess so.
After about an hour, your father stopped it.
My father stopped it?
Yeah, he said, "This has gone on long enough".
Oh, Mork, what did you do?
Oh, lots of things.
I had a great time.
Ever been to a basketball game?
My favorite part was when I got to dance.
You danced?
Oh, yeah, that part at the beginning, where they played the music, everyone stood up and Oh, say can you see?
He's a great kidder.
Then some man asked me to pass him his coffee, so I did.
He didn't catch it, though.
That's too bad.
But your father caught it with his pants.
Then it was his turn to dance.
Then we went to a place called the rest room.
I didn't get any rest there, though.
I had a terrible seat.
Couldn't even see the game.
We went back and some woman asked me to hold her seat, so I. Never mind.
I know, that's when they made us leave.
Uh, are you a friend of the family?
No, I live here.
Live here?
Oh, Brad, see, it's not what you think.
Mindy, he lives here with you, and you go out with other men?
Oh, yeah, but you see, uh Mork, Brad and I aren't quite finished yet.
Oh, I see, you're still hungry.
Mork I'll whip up my special dessert.
No, Mork.
Oh, for you, le monde, mama.
Stay.
Maybe I should leave.
No, Brad.
No, Brad, stay.
We'd like to get to know you better.
Mork.
You see, Mork and I live together, but I still go out with whoever I want.
I mean Mindy, I I don't know what your idea of a relationship is, but I-I'm not a swinger.
Well, neither am I. Oh, swinger.
Baseball.
How about them Broncos?
Brad, I'd really like to see you again.
Oh, we'll get together again.
Soon.
Hey, wait.
You missed the bologna sundae.
Your eyes are leaking.
Are they?
That means something has hurt you, doesn't it?
Yes.
Brad did something, that slimemunger.
I'll follow him to the ends of the universe.
I'll vaporize his entrails.
No, Mork.
It's not what Brad did.
It's that Brad misunderstood our relationship.
That's what made me sad.
Ever since you moved in, guys have stopped asking me out.
And then when somebody does finally like me, like Brad, well He think that you and I are Lovelings.
Yeah.
And then when I tell them we're not, they either don't understand or they don't believe the situation, so I end up not going anywhere, I never go out.
I guess I'm feeling kind of lonely.
It's all because I'm staying here, isn't it?
No, it's not your fault.
It was my idea in the first place to have you move in.
I just have to work this out.
Night.
Hm.
Leaking.
Come on, Mork, get up.
Breakfast.
What do you want, pancakes?
Waffles?
Gladiolas?
Come on, you lazy Orkan.
"Mindy, I know you are sad "because people think you and I are lovelings.
"I don't want you to be sad anymore, "so I'm going away.
"If people from Ork knew how to love, "I'm sure I would love you.
"But I don't even understand what love is.
Love, Mork".
You're doing that very well, Eugene.
Grandma Hudson, thank you for letting me work today.
I need the money so I can buy my mom a birthday present.
Oh, well, that's all right, Eugene.
What are you going to buy her?
The best present in the whole world.
A catcher's mitt.
Wow, that's great.
And it'll go so well with those shin guards you gave her last year.
Oh, say, Eugene, uh, call me if any customer comes in.
Okay.
Guess who?
Uh Stevie Wonder?
What's happening, Mork?
!
Hey, plasma, what it is?
What you doing with the suitcase?
You taking a vacation?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
If you were taking a vacation, where would you go?
I've always wanted to see France.
Kay-o; dosvedanya.
Or maybe the Swiss Alps.
Hey, make up my mind.
It depends on how much money you want to spend.
Uh, six smackers.
You can't go to the Alps with six dollars.
Then France it is.
Arrivederci.
Or France, either.
Hey, bummer.
Are you running away?
How can you tell?
It's written all over your face.
Shazbot I've broken out in words.
Psst.
Can you keep a secret?
I don't want you to tell Mindy where I'm going.
You see, I've, I've been a lot of trouble to her.
Man, you aren't going far on six dollars.
You can't even get a place to sleep unless you stay in a flophouse.
Oh.
Sounds perfect for a flop like me.
Well, there are some places on Mission Street.
But they're awful seedy.
"Seedy".
Oh, I love horticulture.
Hello, Eugene.
Good morning, Mr. McConnell.
What's this?
Looks like a suitcase.
Yes.
Well, somebody must have left it here.
Maybe I better open it up and see if I can find the name of the owner.
Good heavens!
How did that happen?
I don't know.
I told you never to sit on my throne!
I leave you two alone for five minutes, and the whole place goes to pot!
You scoff?
You don't believe?
I tell you, the men from Venus are coming down to take us to their planet.
They arrive Labor Day.
Then they're going to blow up the whole world!
And you sit there eating a sandwich?
Where's the passenger list?
There's only room on the escape ship for and so far we've lined up three.
Pressure.
I've been walking the streets all day, trying to find recruits.
My feet are killing me.
Gad, those make my thighs sweat.
Good-bye.
I saw your signs outside the Friends of Venus?
I thought I'd stop by to see if there's anyone here I know.
Do you know any of the Friends of Venus?
I know some people from Venus.
I know one guy who's kind of cute if you're into short and fuzzy.
His name is .
Gesundheit.
No, no, that's his name.
See, he's got a wife and a litter, and their names are  I'd hate to be the child stuck with a name like  A believer.
A true believer.
What's not to believe?
You believe in people from outer space?
Shazbot.
Nanu-nanu.
Precisely.
My name is Exidor.
I'd like you to join me.
Well, if you insist.
No.
I mean, join our group, be one of us.
Us?
Oh Well, right now, you see, I'm looking for a fliphouse to flap in.
That's flophouse.
Oh, flip, flop whatever.
You can stay here with us.
We'll all work together.
Oh, work.
I finally got a job and a place to flip out all at once.
Oh, Mindy will be proud of me.
Mindy.
Heavy sigh.
Oh, Daddy, Mork ran away.
You've just got to help me find him.
Oh.
well, look, honey, I don't know why he left, but maybe it's the best thing.
No, it's not, Dad!
Mork is like a child here.
He shouldn't be out in the world alone.
He has no concept of trouble or danger.
Oh, Dad, if anything happened to him, : I don't know what I'd do.
I don't want him to go.
All right honey, okay, take it easy, take it easy.
Now, I'll help you find him.
But where would he go?
Oh, I don't know.
I've been looking all morning.
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, I just remembered something.
This morning when I came in, there was a shiny metal suitcase right in the middle of the store.
Mork has a shiny suitcase.
And then the albums fell, and, and Eugene I don't know nothing.
I think we've uncovered a clue.
Mork, this is my philosophy for the Friends of Venus.
I want you to study it and memorize it so that you can go out with me and convert the non-believer.
I'll study hard and let you know when I'm ready.
I'm ready.
Very well, on your feet.
Uh let's pretend that, uh, I am a non-believer, and you try and convert me.
Hey, you, non-believer.
Good start.
But we need more power in your voice, and more conviction.
Oh, I see.
Frey-und!
I have need of your attention.
Friend, do you realize that the Venusians are coming down to Earth?
But they're not coming here on Veterans Day, not on April Fool-es Day, but on Labor Day, Labor Day, Labor Day.
Can you hear me, friend?
I hear you!
Are you ready now?
Can I get a nanu-nanu?
Nanu-nanu.
Thank you, friend.
Do you realize, friends, what they're coming here to do?
Because they've come down here to blow the Earth to smithereens!
But it's not that bad, friend.
Because they're sending a ship down here to save 1,000 of us, and they're making a list, and they're checking it twice.
Now, friend, now, you can either stay down here, in your disco, drug-infested inferno, or come up to Venus, and have your very own Venusian condominimum, with hot and cold running champagne and underwater dancing.
You must apply now!
Mork!
Mork that was beautiful!
Why can't you be more like him?
!
But there's something's missing.
What we need is more of your experiences with the Venusians here on Earth.
I didn't meet them on Earth; I met them on Venus.
You've been there?
Oh, yes, I've been to all the planets in your solar system.
Mars, Mercury, Pluto?
!
Oh, don't ever go to Pluto; it's a Mickey Mouse planet.
You see, Exidor, I have something to explain to you.
The Venusians aren't coming to blow up the Earth.
They're not?
No, you see, their technology isn't prepared for space travel.
It isn't?
No, their highest invention so far has been the garbage can.
It is?
And the only reason they invented that was to have something to tip over.
Blasphemy!
I had high hopes for you, Mork.
You're crazy.
Mork!
Oh, what a relief.
Mindy, I didn't want you to find me here.
You know, I knew as soon as I saw that Friends of Venus sign, I knew you'd be here.
I want you to come home with me now.
No, you don't.
You just say that 'cause you feel sorry for me.
Mork, I don't feel sorry for you.
I feel sorry for me.
I don't understand.
When I'm not there, you're free to do as you wish.
You have a home of your own.
No, what I have is an apartment.
It was only a home when there was somebody in it that I cared about.
Me?
But I get in your way; you told me so.
Oh, I know, and I'm sorry.
I was blaming you because guys stopped asking me out.
And then when one did ask me out I know.
I made a real crimluck of myself.
It was my fault.
Mork, I'm a woman, and, and a woman just sometimes needs to be held.
Mmm, that man Brad, you wanted him to hold you.
Well, not him, necessarily.
I really didn't get a chance to find out.
But yeah, every once in a while a little hug really does help get me through the day.
What's a hug?
Oh, you know, like Like like this?
Yeah.
Oh.
Soft.
I can understand how this keeps you going.
It's got me going, and I don't even know what it is.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Orson I am calling you-oo-oo  What a terrible connection.
Sounds like someone stepped on a frenkle's tail.
Just me reporting from Earth.
And what words of wisdom are you transmitting across the universe today?
I learned how to make a human happy.
I learned how to give a hug.
And a hug is?
It's when you wrap your arms around a human's body and squeeze.
I thought that's what Earthlings call wrestling.
No, in wrestling, you squeeze a lot harder until they sweat and go "Arrgh"!
They don't sweat and go  when you hug them?
No, they just cuddle and go "Ah"!
Oh, hugging.
Amazing what pleases the primitive tribes.
I'll never understand them.
But Orson?
Yes?
It was good for me, too.
Mork!
Yes, Your Immenseness.
This is Mork, signing off from Boulder, Colorado, until next week.
Nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Babalu, Mindy.
Hi, Mork.
Boy, am I glad you're home.
Could you do me a little favor?
Of course.
Uh, would you put away your space suit?
Oh, sure.
Ah, space suit, good to see you.
Ah.
Oh, of course I miss you.
Yes, yes.
You see, I have to wear Earth clothing now that I'm here on Earth.
It's true.
Mork, you talk to your space suit?
Of course.
It spoke first.
I'd be rude not to reply.
But you're treating it like it's alive.
It is.
It's made up of billions of tiny living cells.
Whew!
If you call that living.
I'm sorry you know it's true.
You smell bad.
You see, you earthlings are in a primitive state, but you'll realize that life exists in many forms throughout the universe when you gain higher intelligence and more sophistication.
: Time for dodo num-nums, okay?
What?
No, I can't tell you a story tonight, so you just hang in there.
Ne-ne.
I know it's probably my fault.
Spare the rod and spoil the suit.
Oh, how'd your observation of traffic go today?
Oh, not very well.
Why do they call it rush hour when nothing moves?
Got me.
I had to go to a movie instead.
Oh, you did?
What'd you see?
Oh, it was a love story called Here Comes the Fleet.
Oh, yeah, I love that one.
I'd like to see that one again.
So would I. I have several questions I'd like to ask you about it, if you don't mind.
Oh, go ahead.
All right.
You remember Biff and Margie?
Sure.
You remember when they first met, they had this horrible fight, and then the very next scene, they were together on a date again.
Why?
Because they were falling in love.
Oh, I see.
Ah, sucker's hot.
But there's one small thing I don't understand.
Hmm?
What is this thing called "love"?
You don't know?
I know it's an emotion, but we abolished emotions on Ork a billion bleems ago.
They took a vote, and everyone said, "All in favor"?
Well, Mork, if you want to be an earthling, you're just going to have to experience love.
Oh.
Oh!
Does this love lead to mating?
Yes.
Oh, good, because I've been wanting to try that.
When can we start?
When can we start?
Oh, wow.
DÃ©jÃ  vu.
Yes, you see, we can have a mating, and I can send back a report to Orson complete with slides, video demonstrations Oh Oh.
See, see, Mork, it doesn't quite work like that.
See, um mating I mean, love When a man and a woman really care about each other, then  Mindy, my suit needs me.
I'll be right back.
Sure.
We'll discuss this love another time.
Fine with me.
Your suit really got me off the hook.
Oh, humor.
What is it?
Why didn't you think about this before you went to bed?
I'd give them money if they'd just learn another song.
Cora, well, it does my heart good to see you tending to my inspired little window display.
Has she attracted many customers yet today?
Customers, no.
Dust, yes.
And I'll tell you another thing, Fredzo.
I'm getting a little tired of picking dead flies out of her wig.
Have your little joke, Cora.
Nothing you can say or do is going to upset me today.
Life is wonderful, life is sweet, and I am thrilled to be alive.
Cool it.
You're bringing me down.
Well, if that's your attitude, I'm going to bring you down some more.
Cora what could I have that would say, "Here is a man who is a success"?
A sign saying, "Here is a man who is a success".
Wrong.
Driving a brand-new Cadillac.
That says a man is a success.
Mm, well, it doesn't say much for you.
You drive a '69 compact.
Not after today.
I have scrimped, and I have saved, but it was worth it.
I've got $2,300 in here, and that gives me just enough to swing the deal.
Here, look.
Isn't it a beauty?
Now, why do you need a car three blocks long when you only live a block and a half away?
Well, I don't need the car to drive to work.
I need the car to drive to my high school class reunion this Saturday night, and that's 53 miles from here.
I thought you hated high school.
Oh, no, no, no, I didn't hate high school.
I hated Forrest Collins.
Why?
Because he was big, because he was a bully, and because he said I'd never amount to anything.
You know it's strange, but Elizabeth never told me any of this.
Well, because I never told her.
In fact, I never told anybody about it until now.
But look, that's behind me.
I've saved my money, and I'm getting my Cadillac, and there is nothing that anybody can say that can stand in the way of my happiness.
Hello, Daddy!
Except that.
"Daddy".
Hello, Mork.
Come in.
Hello, Mrs. Hudson.
Where's Mindy?
Well, she's out on an errand, but she should be back soon.
Oh, a wingless hibenginie.
I thought they were extinct.
Guess they are.
Stiff city.
Yes.
Mrs. Hudson.
Hmm?
May I ask you something very personal?
Shoot.
How do you know when you meet the person you'll fall in love with?
Oh, Mork, I promise you, when you meet the right one, you'll know it.
And you knew the minute you met Mr. Hudson?
Oh, yes.
It took 15 years for us to realize it was love at first sight.
Now, you're going to need these while you're waiting for Mindy.
Oh, good, snacks.
No, no.
No.
No, they're, uh they're to make the music sound better.
That's illogical how can anything sound better by putting cotton in your ears?
You'll see.
: I understand you now!
Please be here.
Oh, please, please, please, please be here.
Oh, good!
Oh, no!
Oh, darn it.
Mindy!
Oh, hi, Mork.
Ooh, heavy vibrations.
Early sensor reading says anxiety, depression, state of defunk.
What seems to be the matter?
Oh, I'm just disappointed in the mail.
Ah, then let me teach you something.
You see, it's common throughout the universe for the female of the species to be disappointed in the male.
The nimnul factor's omnipresent, and they can be such beasts sometimes.
No, Mork, you don't understand.
I was expecting a special letter.
Oh, let me give you one.
How 'bout "K"?
Maybe an "F" or a "U"?
Oh, Mork I'm sorry.
I was just trying to cheer you up.
It's not going to help.
See, Mork, I never finished college because I didn't really know what I wanted to do.
Yeah, but now I know I want to go back and go on and get my degree in Journalism, and I'd applied for this scholarship, and I was just turned down, and now I can't go back What are you doing?
Making a fool out of myself.
I understand that's common in light of what's happened.
What do you mean?
Ooh.
I took your advice, and this afternoon, I went out, and I fell in love.
What?
!
Oh, she's beautiful.
The first time our eyes met I knew I knew it was the real thing.
You see, I'm madly  I am madly in love.
Mork, you can't fall madly in love with someone you just met.
Love takes time.
No, you won't say that after you meet Dolly.
Oh.
Well, certainly, I'd like to meet her sometime.
Oh, no time like the present.
She's out in the hall.
Can I bring her in, huh, can I, can I, huh, can I?
Of course.
I mean, you shouldn't have left her standing out there alone.
Oh!
Shh.
Mindy meet Dolly!
You dance divinely, my darling.
Mork.
Oh.
I want you to sit down.
I have to have a little talk with the both of you.
I mean, uh Oh, just sit down.
After you first, my dear.
There we go.
Relax.
Now, I don't know how else to say this but to just come right out with it.
You can't have a meaningful relationship with a mannequin.
Why not?
She's beautiful, shy, quiet.
Of course she's quiet, she can't even talk.
Oh, haven't you heard of body language?
My darling, whoa, oh, oh, oh.
I love it when she talks dirty like that.
Mork, you can't love an inanimate object.
Why not, you say you love your book.
That's different.
And you said you loved Here Comes the Fleet.
That's different, too.
Isn't my love for Dolly different?
That's too different.
That's what I love about her.
She's unique, one of a kind.
That's what makes her wonderful, isn't it?
Oh, Mork, yes, I think she's just wonderful.
Now look, so far my day has been pretty rotten.
Now I'd like to stay here and talk to you two, but I have some problems of my own to work out, so I think I'll just leave.
You have a good time.
We will.
At last we're alone, cara mia.
What shall we do tonight, my love?
Hmm?
Maybe we can go to the Balalaika, that quaint gypsy restaurant and ask for Bella, our favorite waiter, and he'll give us a booth near the oyster bar.
I'd sit near the fireplace, but I know that it bums you out very much.
Then afterwards we'll wander down the street, look in store windows, see if there's anyone there you know.
We can go dancing, my love.
I know you don't like to dance.
You feel a little stiff sometimes, but I have a better idea, cara mia.
Come, stand up in your own special way.
Yes, I'll tell you what  No, no.
Let me sweep you off your feet, my love.
Let me show you some old Roebuck catalogs now, come.
We're going up to my attic.
I'd like to show you some of my special drawings.
A special romantic interlude, just you, Mu-mu and me.
Upstairs we go, my love.
Oops.
Ooh.
Don't tell me, you've got a headache now, don't you?
I don't get it.
What kind of a ding-dong would take a mannequin from a store window?
Well, what kind of a ding-dong would put it there in the first place?
I'm not going to let it upset me.
Today is Fredrick C. McConnell's big day.
Today I become a success.
In one hour, I pick up my brand-new Cadillac.
If that's what makes you happy, have fun.
Hi, Mindy.
Hi.
Hi, dear.
What's wrong?
I guess I'm not very good at hiding my feelings, am I?
No, not unless you're secretly happy.
Honey, honey, what's the matter?
Oh, Daddy, I wanted to surprise you.
I was going to go back to college.
College?
Honey, that's wonder "Was"?
That's just it.
I was hoping for a scholarship, only they canceled the program, and I didn't get it.
And I can't afford the tuition.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Well This is kind of a a dream of yours?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Yeah, I know what that's like.
How much money did you need?
Well, the scholarship was for about $2,000.
$2,000?
That's an interesting figure.
That's that's too interesting for my bankbook.
Mindy.
Boy, is today your lucky day.
I mean, you were gonna surprise me, now I'm gonna surprise you.
Honey, ever since you were a little baby, I've been putting aside a little money for you.
I was gonna save it until you needed it and  well, it looks like you need it now.
What?
There's $2,300 in there.
I wish it could be more.
God, I wish it could be more.
This is incredible.
I'll second that.
Oh, Daddy.
Oh, Daddy, you're wonderful.
I can't believe this.
Well, I'm going to go down right now and sign up.
Oh, thanks.
Ooh, I'll talk to you guys later.
Oh, thanks again, Dad.
Eh, Frederick.
You just did a wonderful thing, and I'm really hacked off about it.
What?
Well, just when I convince myself that you're an absolute wiener, you turn around and turn around and do something nice.
Did you see the look on Mindy's face?
I mean, anybody that can make another human being look like that, he's gotta be a success.
Well, now I can go to my high school class reunion and hold my head up in my old car if it starts.
And so I thought you ought to know that's what he really was saving the money for.
I just don't believe him.
Oh, I know.
Sometimes he acts like a BB stacker, but but underneath, dear, your father's really a a good guy.
Oh, I know.
Well, I'll just have to give him that money back.
Oh, no, no, don't you dare do that.
Oh, no, you made him very happy today.
More than a new car ever could.
And if you want to make me happy, don't you ever dare tell him that I spilled the beans.
Why?
Well, you see, way down I know that your father really loves me, and I don't want to do anything to ruin our rotten relationship.
Good night, Mork.
Good night.
Good night, darling.
Bye, Grams.
Excuse me, but I find this all rather puzzling.
Oh, well, it's just another side of love, Mork.
A father's love for his daughter.
He sacrifices Oh, I know that.
I read Lolita.
Oh.
But it's the other love that complicates things.
What other love?
Well, his love for her.
You see, he calls her bad names, he tries to avoid her, but yet he still loves her?
See, Mork, Dad and Grandma need each other.
And that's what love is all about.
Oh, that's just like my love for Dolly.
You know, Mork, I don't know about the rest of the universe, but here on Earth there's a big difference between a living woman and a mannequin.
Really?
Yeah.
Go get Dolly.
I want to show you something.
All right.
I'll have to wake her up.
She had a headache so I put her in the guest room.
My love.
Get your sleeve off her, you!
Come, my sweet.
Ah, there we go.
Okay, now I want you to hold Dolly's hand.
All right.
Mmm, nice.
Now, I want you to hold my hand.
Oh, even nicer, and the fingers separate.
Okay, now I want you to hug Dolly.
Ooh.
: Help me.
Help me.
Not bad.
Okay, now I want you to give me a hug.
Whoa.
That's very, very nice.
And no dead flies either.
Okay, now I want you to give Dolly a kiss.
Just like in the movies?
Just like in the movies.
Now it's your turn, right?
Well, yeah.
It's all right.
Do you see the difference?
Whoa.
Aah, aah, aah, aah.
Genetic memory.
Whoa, primitive stirrings deep inside.
Whoa.
Whoa.
Amrak.
Crazen.
Yo, baby.
No, no.
Oh.
Oh, I I think I understand.
The for-real human being is much better than a plaster replica.
Oh.
Mindy, can we be alone for a moment?
We are alone.
No, no.
Dolly and me.
Oh.
Oh, sure.
I understand, I think.
Um, I have a few things that I could pick up at the store, anyway, so you two be alone.
Dolly?
Dolly, darling.
We have to have a little talk.
That's all right.
That's why I love you because you're such a good listener.
Dolly?
Why are you staring off into space like that?
I guess you know what's coming.
I You better kinda lay back for a second.
We're different, dear, and I come from a planet where there are no emotions, and all of a sudden I met you and, "zingo," I felt something.
It was like  I guess as you humans say, "I'll stop bushing around the beat".
Um, dear, I when I first met you, I found you very special, the way you the way you're so straight and yet, friendly, and the way your ankles turn around, kinda like backwards like that.
Kinda like Linda Blair and, I I don't know, darling, I : it just isn't going to work.
You're too good for me.
I know, I know.
Well, look at it this way.
Someday you'll meet the mannequin of your dreams, and you're no dummy, Doll I know, no offense.
Sorry.
So all I can say to you, my love, it's it's over.
I, um, I'll miss you.
No, no, don't no, you can't cry.
Take care.
I'll drop by and look in on you, and I'll miss you, love.
No, no, don't pass out on me.
Guess this means farewell forever, my love.
Oh.
You didn't have to give the ring back.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
This is Orson.
What's the matter with you?
Me?
Nothing.
You've got a strange look on your face.
Maybe it's love.
Love?
Isn't that an emotion?
It's a many splendored thing.
It makes the world go round.
It'll keep us together.
It's all you need.
All I need is a report that makes sense.
Oh.
Love doesn't make sense.
That's why earthlings think it's so wonderful.
Is there anything similar to it on Ork?
No.
What happens is you get hot and sweaty.
You can't eat, you can't sleep, and you feel dizzy all the time.
It sounds like that disease you got on Venus.
Yes, Venusian's Revenge.
We Orkans made the right decision in giving up emotions.
I'm not so sure, Orson.
You see, we may have given up too much.
Even though I'm more advanced than these humans, sometimes I I feel so primitive,  I'm afraid I don't understand.
Neither do I, Orson, but I'm not afraid.
This is Mork signing off till next week.
Nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Nanu, nanu.
Shazbot.
There.
Mork, I'm leaving now.
I'll be right down.
I'm ready!
Let's go!
Ah, where do you think you're going dressed like that?
I'm going to the shower with you.
But Mork, this is a bridal shower for a girl who's about to get married.
Oh, on Ork, when we get married, they don't give them a shower, they just hose them down.
Mork, you don't understand.
A shower is another word for a party.
Oh, we'd better take an umbrella, then, because I heard on the radio that it's going to be cloudy with scattered parties.
I'm sorry, Mork, but you can't go with me.
See, this is just for women.
Men aren't allowed.
But I want to be with you.
And I want to be with you, too.
But, you know, you really should get out and meet more friends.
You need to broaden your horizons and grow as a person.
Oh, you're rejecting me because I'm short.
Oh, I'm not rejecting you.
But it's just not fair that I go out tonight; you have to stay here all alone.
Remember, you can learn something from everybody you meet here on Earth.
That's very true.
The garbage men today taught me to never lie on the curb on pickup day.
Mork, what were you doing lying on the curb?
Well, I was watching some ants mug a grasshopper when he came by.
And I suppose you're going to tell me that the garbage man picked you up and threw you into the truck?
No, he said he couldn't do that unless I was tied and bundled.
Mork, this is all very interesting, but the point is that you need to go out and meet other people.
I don't know how to do that.
Just be friendly.
Oh, you mean like this?
Hi, friends, Sal Worthless here, Worthless Motors.
I'll eat the chrome off a trailer hitch just to get me in my parking lot.
Let's all react.
This is my wife Spot and my dog Chuck.
No, it's my dog Chuck and my wife Spot.
If you believe that, you'll buy this watch.
We're just squealing to make you a good deal.
You don't have to put on an act.
Just be yourself.
: Gizbah, funmeega.
Put on an act.
And put on your clothes.
Morning, everybody.
Oh, good morning, honey!
Did you enjoy yourself at that shower last night?
Well, it was really kind of different.
Beth said that she and Jim are going to take separate honeymoons.
Separate honeymoons?
Yeah.
They've been living together so long, they need a little time alone.
Well, dear, where's Mork this morning?
Oh, he's out in the neighborhood making new friends.
Ah, well, there goes the neighborhood.
Why don't you just admit it, Daddy, I know you like him.
Yeah, I'd sooner be tied to an amplifier at a Grateful Dead concert.
That can be arranged.
Oh, excuse me, do you have Neil Diamond?
Only in my dreams.
Susan?
Susan Taylor!
I don't believe it.
Mindy!
Mindy McConnel!
I haven't seen you in three years.
What are you doing dressed like that?
What do you mean?
Aren't you a nun?
What?
Me?
Whatever would give you that idea?
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Uh Peace Corps.
Airline stewardess?
Oh, come on, I know it was one of those unselfish professions.
No, I was never going to do any of those things.
Oh, what a shame.
You would have made such a sweet nun.
You always were so sweet.
Well, thanks, but I work here now.
Gee, it must be so exciting working in a music store, selling the instruments and sorting the sheet music and dusting off whatever.
Susan, you aren't still mad at me because of Jack, are you?
Jack?
Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.
Oh, you must mean Jack Peterson.
That devastatingly handsome captain of the football team that you stole behind my back.
Who is now president of the National Bank of Boulder and wanted to marry me and by now would have given me a $200,000 home, and the possibility of high regard in the community.
That's the one.
Gee, I never gave that a second thought.
So, what have you been doing since graduation?
Oh, nothing much.
I was a little depressed about Jack, so Susan, I never went after Jack.
He's the one who chased me.
Mindy, dear, you'll just have to help your father with the inventory.
I have a bad case of wiener fatigue.
Okay, Grandma.
Susan, don't go away.
I want to talk to you later.
Don't worry.
Hi.
Would you like to be my friend for life?
What's your name?
Bug off, creep.
Oh.
I'm Mork.
May I just call you Bug Off?
Nanu, nanu.
How'd you like a knuckle sandwich?
Sorry, I don't eat meat.
Is there anything I could do for you?
Yeah.
Get out of my sight.
Oh, hide-and-seek.
I know how to play that game.
Infinity!
Here I come!
Boy, he's good.
Whoa you're a very interesting specimen.
What's your name?
Bug off.
Wow, dÃ©jÃ vu, I just met your brother.
Why don't you take a hike?
Oh, football.
I know that one!
We got a good ball game, it's gonna be a good ball club.
I got it, baby!
I got aah!
I'm in the zone!
I'm in the zone!
I know.
It's too much craziness.
Yeah.
This is a music store, you see, not Mile-High Stadium.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hudson.
Do you know where Mindy is?
Yeah, she's in back.
She'll be out in a few minutes.
I didn't realize you were a friend of Mindy's.
Oh, yes.
We live together.
Oh, really.
That's interesting.
I'm Susan Taylor.
I'm Mork.
Nanu, nanu.
Whatever.
Oh, are you a friend of Mindy's, too?
Oh, yes, yes, from way back.
Well, since we're both friends of Mindy's, why can't we be friends together?
Oh, Mork, I think that's a wonderful idea.
We should be friends.
Close friends.
As a matter of fact, I think we should celebrate by going out tonight.
Oh, Kay-o.
You want to pick me up?
If you insist.
Is that what you do on a date?
Yeah, well, whatever turns you on.
That did.
Uh, so, what-what do you drive, Mork?
Oh, a Grembo Pasati.
Oh, marvelous.
Is that a foreign car?
Oh, not where I come from.
I bought it from Gezo Geb.
It's been in the shop for three bleems.
That's okay.
We can use my car.
Um, tell me, where do you live?
Oh, one-six, one-nine, Pine Street.
It's just a hop, skip and a churnel from here.
Great.
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
Oh.
Oh, hi.
Mindy, you'd be real proud of me.
I made a friend right here in the store.
You did?
What's his name?
Oh, it's a she.
It's a human specimen named Susan.
When she found out we were living together, she wanted to be my friend real bad.
: I'll bet she did.
In high school, Susan had a habit of collecting friends Oh.
Other people's friends.
Oh, she sounds real friendly then.
Yeah, well, that's the game she plays.
Oh, that and football, and I'll see you after the game.
Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rock 'em.
Get that ball and really fight!
Mork, what are you doing in there?
You've been in that bathroom for over an hour.
Taking the worry out of being close.
Well, you'd better take the worry out of being late because Susan's going to be here any minute.
Whoa!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Volgar the Enforcer!
Over there!
Mork, what are you doing?
The sacred flame is burning.
It's a candle and it's burning because I just lit it.
Wait, wait.
You're safe.
Ah.
Phew!
Phew!
What a relief.
I was scared Orkless.
Why?
On Ork, when the sacred flame is lit, it means that Volgar is coming to torture you.
I thought you Orkans had done away with violence.
Violence, yes; torture, no.
Mork, there's no such thing as nonviolent torture, except for The Gong Show.
Oh, no.
Volgar is even more terrifying than Chuck Barris.
What they do is, they march you up to the Sacred Kraal, and then Oh, no, no, it's too terrifying to even think about it.
They stretch you out and they tickle you by candlelight.
Thank God it's never happened to you.
Well, a few guys have tried, but Oh, that means that Volgar is coming, it's terrifying.
The mere thought of it, well, it makes me laugh.
Ha!
No, shh.
Mork, why would they want to torture you?
You see, before I got this assignment, I got a speeding ticket from the Stellar Patrol.
They said I was going the speed of light in a speed of sound zone.
I would have stopped but I didn't hear the siren until after they arrested me.
What happened, didn't you pay the ticket?
Well, Orson said he fixed it, but I'm still terrified of hearing  Yeah, I'd be a little worried if I heard that too.
Right, it means that Volgar is coming and it strikes terror into the hearts of jaywalkers, speeders and those who tell jokes.
Telling a joke is a crime on Ork?
Only if it gets a laugh.
Mindy, I'd really like it if you came along with me tonight.
Mork, group therapy is fine.
Group dates I am not into.
But I need you.
I need your advice.
Just be polite.
Be a gentleman.
Pull out her chair.
Ah, practical jokes.
Onk!
No, no, that's not what I mean.
Oh, see, wrong again.
That's why I need you.
I have no need to sit through an entire evening with you and Susan.
Oh, I see.
Jealousy rears its ugly head.
Me, jealous of plain old Susan?
Boy, that's a laugh.
First of all, I'm not the jealous type, and secondly, what's to be jealous of?
Susan.
May I come in?
Oh, sure.
You look, uh, different.
Thank you.
I took a bath.
Did you?
He's such a kidder.
Oh, yeah.
Mork's never serious.
Oh, Mindy, I hope you don't mind that Mork and I are going out tonight.
Oh, of course not.
Mork can do whatever he wants.
That's so sweet of you.
Yeah.
Well, I guess we should be going.
Plain, old Susan.
Oh, Mindy, it's just such a shame that have to stay here all alone.
Oh, well.
I asked her to come along, but she said she didn't want to go.
Well, oh, if you insist, Mork.
Oh, and Susan, you and I have so much to catch up on.
Fred.
Fred!
What's the matter with you?
I haven't seen you so happy since the Beatles broke up.
Well, it isn't every day I gain a daughter and lose a Mork.
Fred.
Huh?
Huh?
Fred!
Fred, what makes you think they're going to split up?
Oh.
Well, Mindy told me what happened last night, and apparently Mork wants to see a lot more of Susan.
Why, hello, kids.
Well, hello.
Did you have a good time on your date last night, Mork?
Yes.
We went to a big parking lot with a giant TV in the front.
Oh.
How did you like the movie?
I didn't watch the movie.
Aha.
He was too busy looking at all the cars.
Well, how do you know that?
Because I sat between them.
But why?
Because I couldn't get Susan to sit in the back seat.
It didn't matter, though.
I didn't see anything.
All the car windows were steamed up.
Gosh, I'd hate to count up all the car windows I've steamed up in my day.
I'll get that.
McConnell's Music.
Oh, hello, Susan.
Yes, he's here.
Just a minute.
It's your girlfriend.
Oh.
Susan.
Whoa, oh  Yeah, she's gone now.
Yes.
: Oh, yes, whoa Yes.
Okay, I'll tell her.
Bye.
Ciao, arrivederci, chelan delecito.
Mindy, Yes.
Susan asked me over for dinner, but she said to tell you that she only has enough food for two.
That's the most insulting thing I ever heard.
Oh, Dad.
Mindy, can I borrow some money to buy her some flowers?
No, that's the most insulting thing I ever heard.
How can you as a self-respecting human being?
Uh, whatever.
How can you, how can you dare to borrow money from my daughter to take out her friend who is only trying to steal you away from her, and obviously wants to get her hooks into you Is $20 enough?
Coming.
Hello, Mork.
Good-bye.
I brought you some presents.
Oh, thank you.
Here's five dollars.
Thanks, but I already have one.
Oh.
Then here's some vegetation.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, you  You're welcome.
Mindy picked them out.
Yes, well, I'm, I'm allergic to daisies.
Oh, she must have forgotten.
I'll bet.
Well, tell me, Mork, uh, what do you and Mindy talk about when you're all alone together?
Lots of things.
I tell her everything.
Hmm, well, she'll just love hearing about what happens tonight.
Are you two, uh, very close?
Oh, yes; sometimes we stand right next to each other.
Ah, well, that's very interesting.
I, I think I'd like a little wine.
All right, if you insist.
I'll get the bottle.
Oh Susan has a pet.
Long tongue.
Oh, and well-trained.
So, tell me, what do you do with your days?
Oh, today I went to see a cowboy movie.
: Jeb, I hate to say this, but I'm in love with your buffalo.
Yeah.
Would you open the wine?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
If there's some trail dust that has to be washed out, I'll get right at it.
What are you doing?
!
It's open.
Look at this mess.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I, I'd better head back to Mindy.
Uh, no, no, no, no, Mork, that's all right.
Uh, I, I can get a new dress.
And a new sofa.
And a new rug.
Uh, why don't we just change the mood a little?
Oh, that reminds me of a joke.
These two Venusians walk into a bar.
One says to the other, "Ee-vizbah".
The other one replies, "Arg, nimnull, arg".
I guess you've heard it.
The other one is, how many Martians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Oh does the name Volgar mean anything to you?
This is no time to joke.
Just stretch out and relax.
Oh, no!
You're not going to stretch me out in your Kraal!
Waah!
Volgar the Enforcer!
Oh you're not going to tickle me not at least alive!
Whoop!
Too late!
Oh, you're crazy!
Hey, you're crazy if you think you're going to let Volgar tickle me here.
All right, now, stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
No!
No!
Don't tickle me!
Don't tickle me!
Don't tickle me!
Ahh!
!
Mindy!
Mindy.
Mork, I didn't hear you come in.
Oh.
Shall I go back out and come in noisier?
Do whatever you want.
Kay-o.
You want to hear about my date?
Oh I know what you're doing.
It's called the silent treatment.
We used to have it on our planet, but we banned it because we thought it was an earthy thing to do.
So, how was your dinner?
I don't know.
We didn't get to eat.
Yeah, it looks like you were too busy doing other things.
Uh-oh.
Ring around the collar.
Mork, do you think I'm jealous?
Why should I be jealous?
What you and Susan do on your date has nothing to do with me, and that's that.
Don't you want to hear what happened?
Down to the last sordid detail.
All right, here's the Reader's Digest version.
Ding dong.
Here's some flowers.
: Thank you very much.
: I'd like a little wine.
Long tongue, whoop, homing instinct.
Da-da-da-da-da-da.
: Would you open it?
: Sure.
Psshh!
Ahh!
Oh, no!
Whoa, do you know anyone named Volgar?
: Ah, no, no, ah!
: No, whoa, ah General destruction.
Ah, I can see it right now blood, death, everything.
Ah, don't tickle me, don't tickle me, don't tickle me!
That's what happened.
Oh Oh, Mork, I'm so sorry your date didn't go well.
It didn't?
Well I guess it wasn't a total loss.
At least you learned something from it.
You know, I learned something about myself tonight.
Like what?
I didn't want to admit it, but I was jealous.
Why?
I don't know.
You and I are We're best friends.
You know, we're buddies.
We're pals.
Oh, I think I understand.
Mindy What?
I'd like to kiss my pal.
All right.
Oh, pulse.
Rapid heartbeat.
Temperature rising.
I get it!
What did you get?
I think I know what made those car windows steam up at the drive-in.
Ah Well, you want to watch television?
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Orson to Mork.
Orson to Mork.
Orson to Mork.
Orson to Mork!
Well, have you made any new discoveries on Earth?
Yes, sir.
This week I met a new female specimen.
Whew!
Her name is Susan.
And she tried to kiss me.
Why?
I don't know.
It's an old Earth custom practiced frequently by lovers, relatives and talk show guests.
Did you kiss her?
No.
I wanted to kiss my pal.
Good thinking, Mork.
Wait just a grindle!
Isn't that the girl Mindy?
That's my pal.
Your life is starting to sound like a real soap opera, Mork.
Just remember, your mission is to report objectively about life on Earth.
Don't get involved!
You can count on me, Your Immenseness.
I'd be the last one on Earth to get involved.
Oh, this is Mork, signing off from Boulder, Colorado.
See you next week, Mindy.
I mean, I mean Morson.
Whew!
An-nu.
An-nu.
Whoa.
Mmm oh.
Ciao.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Oh.
I'm hungry.
I wish Frederick would get back from lunch.
Yeah.
How could he leave us at the height of our rush hour?
Yes.
Oh, say!
Business is picking up.
That last couple came to a full stop.
Do me my shazbow di din daz bow doe Mork, what are you doing?
Singing the Orkan blues.
Going to nanu all night long Oh, say, I like that.
Do you know the "No Sales Blues"?
Come on, you guys.
Stop fooling around.
I really feel sorry for Dad.
So do I.  Why do we feel sorry for Dad?
Business is the pits.
Yeah, and on top of that, the water pipe broke in his house and flooded the entire living room.
That's too bad, because the wet look is out.
Yes, but it's no fun trying to wring out a wet couch.
Yeah, and it cost almost $3,000 to repair the plumbing and dry out all the furniture.
Say, Mindy, do you know where those invoices are for the records?
Oh, yeah, we ran out, but there's more in the back.
Oh, okay.
I'll show you where they are.
Hey, Mork, could you kind of watch the store while we're back there?
Whoa!
Oh!
Like to buy a record?
No, I'm just kind of browsing.
Great luck.
Let's all hear the special deal new from Rotel Marcel Marceau's Greatest Hits.
Who can ever forget "Man Ascending an Escalator"?
How's it go?
"Man Walking the World's Longest Staircase".
There he goes, walking across it now.
Also, let's just forget the vinyl, and look inside, see the other quite exciting values you can get free with this.
Look, it can be a hand glove, also can dice, slice, and make julienne fries.
It can also be a party favor, a King Tut hat.
Who knew?
Also a puppet for a two-dimensional child.
"Hi, Mom, nice to have you home".
These and many more can be yours for only $1.99.
Offer void where prohibited by good taste.
You are one funny guy, with loads of energy, pal.
But you know, I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
Do you, uh  know one Mindy McConnell?
I know one.
Are there more?
Well this one's 21, brunette, and lives at 1619 Pine Street.
Uh uh, excuse me, but who are you, and how do you know who I am?
Well I, uh, saw the, uh, front of the store that said "McConnell's Music Store," and : well, he, uh, told me your name.
I didn't mention her name.
Well, you implied it.
Ooh, a psychic.
Well, how do you know where I live?
Well, it was kind of a hunch.
Could you excuse me for just a moment?
Here's the deal I'm actually from the Boulder Evening Sun.
Clint Mullet, ace reporter.
You don't act too much like a reporter.
Well, actually, I'm just Clint Mullett, ace copy boy.
Oh, copy boy, a clone!
I'm working on a story so big no other reporter would touch it.
It's the biggest cover-up since the Greenbrier Scandal.
I never heard of that.
You see?
My editor was so scared when he saw my first few pages, he threw the whole story in the trash.
How does Mindy fit into your trash?
Good question, boy.
All right, it seems that a few months ago, you were up at Boulder Lake with one Bill Mason.
How do you know that?
Did you see anything unusual that night?
Like what?
Well, UFOs?
Oh, what?
You know, flying saucers?
Flying saucers.
You don't believe in them, do you?
You don't?
No, I'm into flying eggs.
Oh.
Flying saucers, don't make me laugh.
Now, look, 12 people in your area reported seeing glowing flying saucers.
Now, it was a dark night.
My question is, why didn't you see any glowing objects?
Mindy, these are the wrong invoices.
Um, all right, Grandma.
I'll be right back.
What was your name again?
Uh, Clint Mullet, the next Lou Grant.
Listen, it was really nice getting to know you, and if I remember that I saw a flying saucer, I will let you know.
Tell you what, save some coffee for Tuesday, all right?
Right.
Whoa, that was a close call.
Mindy!
I'll be right back.
: I knew it.
I sensed it, I felt it.
She knows something.
She knows something.
She knows a lot of things.
She watches Rona Barrett.
Did she ever talk to you about a strange creature from another planet?
About one, no.
You know, I'm into aliens.
You like science fiction?
Hey, sci-fi's my life.
It is?
Did you ever read Tales of the Milky Way?
I skimmed right through it.
And you talk about these kind of things with Mindy?
Sure thing.
Hmm.
You know, you and I have got a lot in common.
We ought to get together, have some lunch Talk about outer space, alien beings Mindy.
Does this mean we're going to be friends?
Oh, you betcha, pal.
You know, if my theory is right, there's probably an alien right here in Boulder.
So, be on the lookout for anything strange or unusual.
You bet.
Nanu-nanu.
Do you realize what a close call that was?
Guess what?
Clint wants to be my friend.
Are you crazy?
!
Of course he wants to be your friend.
You're the one he wants.
I know that, but there's an old Orkan phrase "The best place to hide from the enemy is right under his noses".
Oh, but Mork Mork, what if he finds out that you?
Uh that you don't read the Boulder Evening Sun?
Then he won't be my friend?
He might not.
Then I better run out and buy a copy right now.
Hello!
Oh, that boy really wigs me out.
I love him.
What's the matter, dear?
Is something wrong?
Well, there was this crazy reporter in here, and he thinks that men have landed from outer space.
And he thinks that I know something about it.
Oh!
Of all the crazy wieners.
Yeah.
Well, now, don't you worry, dear.
If he comes back again, I'll kick him right in his Sunday supplement.
Oh!
Wow, it's a lucky day.
Mindy, look!
What happened?
He almost got hit by a bus.
Mork, you should know better than to walk out into the street before looking.
If you hadn't pulled me out from in front of that bus, I'd be dead meat right now at Boot Hill.
Well, Mork, it was no big deal.
I just happened to be there.
Oh, thank you.
I I owe you everything, my life, my firstborn.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you Mork-Mork, please stop saying "Thank you, thank you, thank you".
You're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome, you're welcome.
Now, cut that out.
You're right, Master.
You're always right.
I cleaned up the house and everything.
Can I make you another sandwich, huh?
Can I, huh?
Can I, huh?
Huh?
Can I, huh?
Mork, Mork, ca-can't you find something else to do?
We can hold the funeral now.
Anything, just lea What funeral?
The one for the chair I zapped.
My Chippendale chair.
Good grief, man, why did you zap my chair?
Mercy killing its leg was broken.
But that chair was a hundred years old.
Well, at least it had a full life.
My trombone.
I need my trombone.
I have to have my trombone.
See, trombone Oh Foot bone's connected to the ankle bone Ankle bone's connected to the shin bone Shin bone Uh, trombone, yeah!
Mork, please leave me alone.
But you saved my life.
I owe you everything.
But anybody would have pulled you out from in front of that bus.
Not on my planet.
You see, no one would even care.
They don't even have emotions on my planet.
What's it like, not having any emotions?
Well, it's a real bummer.
But being with you makes me happy.
I'll get it!
Oh, no, no, no!
No, I'll get it.
No, no, no, no Ah too late!
I'm there!
Daddy's residence.
It's for you, my liege.
Hello?
Oh, I, uh Mr. Wilson?
Oh, oh, yes, from the high school, yes.
How are you?
Oh, your, uh your bandleader is sick.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
You want me to conduct the orchestra on Saturday?
Oh!
Well I certainly hope he feels better on Sunday.
What?
I-I mean, it's cutting it a little close, but I can get it done, uh-huh.
Right.
Money?
Oh, well, no.
I don't think I can afford more than Oh, you're going to pay me.
Oh, that-that's wonderful.
Thank you, Mr. Wilson.
Thank you.
Mork, they've asked me to conduct an orchestra for money.
I can't believe it.
That's great news.
I have some even greater news.
Hmm?
Remember how this trombone used to slide?
Well, I fixed it so this sucker will never slip on you again.
Out.
Out!
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Wax your violin?
Hose down your organ?
Out!
Aah, aah!
Great game.
Now it's your turn.
: It's you.
It's M Mork.
Mork!
Mork, how did you get in here?
Well, I saw you come up through the ladder, so I hid.
Tag, you're it.
You're toying with me, aren't you?
You can see right through me.
No, you're opaque.
Come here, Mork.
Listen, Mork, I'm convinced that Mindy knows something about these UFO sightings.
So, I'm over here snooping around for some clues.
Clues?
Like what?
Well, you know, Mork, a clue could be anything, you know?
It could be big, it could be small But it takes a trained eye to spot a real clue, my friend.
Sometimes, they can even be right under your nose.
I have the same theory.
No kidding.
Well, one day, you may be an investigative reporter like me.
For instance, what's this?
Oh, I Looks like some kind of folder, doesn't it?
Yeah.
And there's something written on it, too.
Hi, Mork.
Oh, uh hi, uh, Clint.
Hello, Mindy.
This is my father, Frederick.
Uh, Dad, this is the reporter I was telling you about.
I have evidence here that leads me to believe that Mindy knows an alien the leader of a planet Orch?
Uh-oh, confusion, fear, look of cold terror.
Yes, it's right here.
It says it uh "Orch Leader".
I don't believe it.
This is my father's music.
That's O-R-C-H Orch.
It's an abbreviation for "orchestra leader".
It's music for the local high school.
Sure.
Oh, Clint, you lose again.
Better start all over again and come through the window.
Wait a minute, you came through my window?
Did you break in here?
Not actually All right now, buddy.
You've gone over the line.
I'm calling the cops.
Cops!
I know that game.
Freeze!
Nobody move!
and one Caucasian male.
Hello?
This is an emergency.
Some man has just broken into my apartment.
Well, he broke into my apartment, and he's here right now Wait a minute.
Hang on just a second.
What's this?
Uh, never mind.
Uh This looks to me like some kind of space helmet.
Space helmet!
Does this look like a space helmet?
This is my planter.
Well it doesn't look like a planter to me.
Now look, you're starting to get on my nerves.
So, why don't you just leave my apartment, and I don't ever want to see you around here again.
Wait a minute, just a second.
Hang on everybody, okay?
I've got a little admission to make.
Okay, now, you're all familiar with the newspaper The American Inquirer?
Good.
Well they're offering a $25,000 reward for proof that there's an alien being living on Earth.
Now, here's the proposition.
Listen close.
I'll give you the money.
All I want is exclusive rights to the story.
All I want is the fame.
Tell you what.
All you have to do is get me proof that there's an alien being here on Earth, and the money's yours.
Who ever thought I'd be guest conductor for a high school band?
Well, who knows?
Maybe somebody will hear me and see me, and hire me to conduct some real music, huh?
Yeah, wouldn't it be nice?
Yeah.
I know you could use the extra money.
Boy, I sure could use that $25,000 reward.
Dad!
Oh, honey, honey, don't worry.
I wouldn't turn Mork in.
I have to admit, that's an awful lot of money.
I don't even know what I'd do with that much.
I know what I'd do.
I'd pay off the plumbing bills, and I'd still have enough left over to get the store back on its feet, or at least on its knees.
Yeah, having that much money sure would be nice.
Well, it's pointless to even think about it.
We can't turn Mork in.
I know, I know.
We just have to be happy with what we are and what we have.
Well, I guess I'd better get home and help Cora with the clarinet parts.
It's going to be a long night.
Well, I'll go with you and help out.
Oh, honey, you've done enough, as it is.
Oh, don't even worry about it, Dad.
If I help, you two can get to bed a lot sooner.
Hey, Mork, I'm going to go over to Dad's for awhile, so I'll see you later.
Yeah.
See you.
Well, it is getting late, so I think I'll hit the road.
Okay, honey.
All right, I'll see you tomorrow, Dad.
Right.
Good night.
Night.
Oh!
Mork.
Uh what are you doing here?
I've thought it over, and I think I'll turn myself in for that reward.
Well, why would you want to do a crazy thing like that?
So I can give you the money.
What?
Well, see, I have to pay you back.
Mindy's my friend, and especially you, because you saved my life.
And I know you need the money really badly.
Oh, Mork, everybody needs money.
That's right.
You don't have to do a thing like that.
Well, I want you to be able to go back to college full time, and I want you to be able to put your business back on its knees again.
Mork Mork, that's very generous of you, but you don't know what kind of a price you'd have to pay.
Oh, Mork, you just don't know what they'd do to you.
Your life wouldn't be your own anymore.
Oh, yes, I have an idea.
They'd make me a celebrity, movies Oh, eventually I'd end up on Hollywood Squares in a box.
: Disgusting!
Yeah, and that's just the good part.
Really?
Yeah, you wouldn't have any privacy anymore.
I mean, just think, little children will be following you around, saying, "Nanu-nanu".
Yes, and adults will be walking up and saying, Shazbut.
Oh, if and if they only knew what that meant.
Oh!
I mean, think about it!
They'd come out with dolls, games!
Oh, it could be awful!
It would be like living in a zoo!
They may stick you in a bottle.
A bottle.
My grandfather was a bottle, and he died a broken man.
You know, there's a chance, too, that we would never see you again.
They make you invisible?
No, but they'll take you away.
Oh, looks like my future is no bed of raisins.
I want to help my friends, but I don't know what to do.
Whew, I got to think this one under.
Frederick!
Cora!
What's the matter?
Somebody better call for a plumber.
And I'll go back and start bailing.
Well, that settles it.
Oh, well, Mork, tell the plumber to come here right away, that it's an emergency.
Hello, Clint?
Mork here.
If you want to see a real live alien being, be at Mindy's house at noon tomorrow.
Be there or be square.
'Bye.
Now, what's the number of the plumber?
Come in.
Mork, where are you?
I'm up here.
I'll be right down.
Where is he?
Where is the alien?
He's getting dressed.
What a day for mankind.
What an event in the history of the universe.
What a break for my career.
I can see it now.
I'll be in Washington two years from now.
The President, he'll call me.
"Clint, we need you, you're a good man".
I am Mork, from Ork, sent by my superiors to observe your primitive civilization and report back.
Nanu-nanu.
You called me here for this?
Red pajamas and silver boots?
You look like a reject from the O'Jays.
But I'm a member of a superior civilization, really.
Mork, come on, I know you need the money, but Wait!
I can prove it.
Watch.
I'll make that plant rise into the air.
Butterfinger.
I don't perform well under pressure.
Mork, this is silly.
I'm splitting.
This is ridiculous.
Wait!
How many people do you know that can drink with their finger?
I'm sorry about this.
I'll get back to you.
Wait a minute.
How did you do that?
Greetings.
I am Mindy, Catwoman from Mars.
Mindy, what are you doing?
I was sent here to observe your primitive planet.
But that's my job.
Listen, I'm the only alien here.
Of course you're an alien.
I'm an alien.
We're all aliens.
I am Fredzo from Scherzo!
Somehow, I feel alienated.
I have been sent down here to observe your primitive society and demonstrate my great powers.
Here, pick a card, any card.
Clint, I don't know how to tell you this, but they're jiving your socks off.
Who else could do this?
Watch this pitcher.
How do you like them eagles?
Big deal.
Move aside, boys.
Watch this.
Did you see that?
Just a second.
Hang on just a second.
There's a wire here.
This whole thing is rigged.
Oh well, Mork, he found us out.
Shazbut!
Shazbut!
Look, I just want to say that, uh, you are the most unconvincing group of aliens I have ever seen in my life.
And, uh, Mork, you are the worst.
The next time you try and impersonate an alien, why don't you just leave the pajamas home?
I refuse to be made a fool of.
Too late.
It's a real space suit.
I paid 50 trivets for this in New Ork.
Now you'll never get the money you need for the store.
Well, we won't get it from finking on you.
We've been down before, but we'll get out.
Yeah, we always have before.
Anyway, Mork, I don't want to lose you.
And besides I've grown accustomed to your honk!
Why did you do that, when you needed the money so really badly?
Oh, you don't understand.
Mork, you're more important than any amount of money.
You can't buy friendship.
So, even if I had turned myself in, it would have been for nothing.
That's right.
And you saved me from that.
Well yes.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you  thank you, thank you Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson!
I hear you, Mork.
Whoa!
What are we going to talk about this week?
Believe it or not, Your Immenseness, my value on the Earth market is $25,000, or 100 yen.
How much is that in grebbles?
Oh, a measly 0.3.
Money seems to be important to Earthlings.
Oh, you bet your sweet shobow.
They put it in a place called a "bank".
What happens at a bank?
Well, you bring in your money.
It meets other money, mates, and makes more money.
Also, this money seems to have a certain rubber-like quality, because you can bounce a check, or stretch a dollar.
Can anyone get money from the bank?
No, only the rich, and those with proper identification.
Also, a bank will only lend you money to buy a boat, or a big car, not to buy food.
Why is that?
I guess food's harder to repossess.
We will store that information, Mork, even though it's from you.
Thank you, Your Immenseness.
By the way, don't take any wooden grebbles.
This is Mork, signing off until next week.
Nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Return to mother ship.
Sanctuary.
Thank you.
Ah, shells.
All I hear is sugar.
I won't hurt you if you tell me where the others are hiding.
Whoa Good morning.
Morning.
How's your Danish?
: Yeah, sure, it's coming along fine now but right now, it sounds a lot like Swedish.
I mean the rolls.
Oh.
Whoa, it's late.
I got to get to work.
Why are you wearing that rubber coat?
Oh, this is a raincoat.
It keeps my clothes dry.
Why not leave your clothes here and go out naked?
I don't think so.
I never know when I might have to demonstrate the accordion.
Oh, humor.
You don't have to worry, though.
It's not going to rain today.
Well, sure it is.
I just heard it on the radio.
Mindy, we Orkans are very sensitive to the positive and negative ion ratio in the air  and the ion ratio today tells me  sunny and clear.
Are you sure?
The ion ratio  would not lie to you.
Well, it never has before.
Okay, you win.
You mind if I go to the store with you today?
I'm observing the leader of the dogs.
What leader of the dogs?
The red leader in front of the store: the short one with the four bumps that hangs around the curb.
Oh that's a fire hydrant.
That's not the leader of the dogs.
Then why do they all salute him?
I'll explain it on the way.
Oh.
Grandma, why are they tearing up the concrete outside?
Grandma.
I'll save her.
They'll never harm you again.
Well, thank you for, uh, saving my life.
I think I'll need the earmuffs again to tune out that jackhammer concerto outside.
Yes, we noticed the workmen installing a hole.
How can you miss it?
You have to be a broad jumper to get into the store.
It's a good thing I'm wearing my orthopedic sneakers.
You know, it's freezing in here.
Yeah, it's colder than a witch-digger's brass monkey.
Is our rotten landlord trying to break the lease again?
Why?
He hasn't even finished breaking the sidewalk yet.
Hey, Mork, what's happening?
Give me some skin.
Eh Nanu-nanu.
Neva.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  What it is, what it was And what it shall be.
Right on.
Hey, where'd the great pile of dirt come from?
I think it came with the hole.
Okay, Eugene, it's time for your violin lesson.
But it's too cold to practice in here.
Honey, the way you play, you can leave your mittens on and nobody will know the difference.
What if my fingers freeze, and I can't play anymore?
Your parents will send me a thank you note.
Now quit stalling, Eugene.
Get in there, you jive turkey.
Keep cool, mama Keep cool, mama.
Uh, hello there.
Well, Dad, the landlord is at it again.
Yeah, I know.
I just came through the obstacle course out front.
There's a ten-foot hole out there.
I know.
Somebody's going to get killed.
Arnold Wanker doesn't seem to understand we have another two years left on our lease.
And you don't seem to understand that if Arnold Wanker can kick us out, he can lease this space to the restaurant next door and double the rent.
Shazbot!
Electric Danish.
Why are you wearing your raincoat today?
Oh, it's going to rain.
I heard it on the radio.
It's not going to rain.
Can't you feel the ion ratio?
Now we're cooking.
Get down.
Get back up again.
Can't I hear the ion ratio?
Ah you've been talking to Trash Gordon again.
His name is Mork, and he happens to be able to understand a lot of things we can't even comprehend yet.
Yeah, apparently.
He's dancing to a sound effects record.
Wow, bummer.
Um excuse me.
Excuse me.
Why is it so cold in here?
Arnold Wanker is trying to freeze us out.
Now, this has got to be the dirtiest trick he's ever played.
Uh, no, no, no.
The worst thing he ever did was in sixth grade.
He came out to the baseball field and he gave us all the free lemonade we could drink.
That's not funny.
Oh.
Then we found out he'd put a padlock on the only bathroom.
It cost me two weeks' allowance to buy the key from him.
Now that's funny.
Ah, oh, ah.
Confusion.
Heavy sigh.
I better be going.
Charming family you have.
Take care of them.
Well strung.
See you at lunch, Mindy.
Bye.
Are you going to be all right?
Yes.
My project for today is to go to the park and observe how pigeons train old people to feed them.
Hello.
Eugene is on automatic pilot.
It was either leave the room or put on my earmuffs again.
Dad was just telling me what a rotten kid Arnold Wanker used to be.
Oh, yes, dreadful.
I baby-sat him when he was five, and he blackmailed me for all my baby-sitting money.
Did he catch you necking with your boyfriend on the couch?
No.
That would've only cost me half the money.
Half the money?
Grandma, what were you doing?
Uh, she was probably supplying illegal drugs to Civil War soldiers.
Oh, why don't you go sit on your Schubert.
Mindy, dear, I think we ought to lay in a couple dozen of this disco album.
It's number 18 with a bullet.
Grandma, how come you know so much about disco?
I know everything.
I'm old.
There.
That should kill it.
Don't look at me like that.
I'll still respect you.
: Please, I-I want to be your friend.
I won't hurt you if you just don't scream.
Do you have any last words?
Okay.
Lunch is hell.
Don't you understand by your doing this, a can of soup will live?
Necrotrons!
Warning!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Red alert!
Dive!
In the bunker!
In the bunker!
Head 'em up.
We're going to Missouri.
Whoo!
Bullets!
Total World War!
Warning.
Jive teapot.
You'll never sing again.
I'd like to speak to you about your "ion ratio".
You fell for it.
You mean you knew it was going to rain outside?
Sure.
I heard it on the radio.
Then why did you tell me to go out without my raincoat and umbrella?
I was splinking.
Why am I afraid to ask?
You see, on Ork, splinking is telling someone something that isn't true a practical joke.
Well, Mork, you might call it splinking, but we humans call it lying, and it isn't acceptable behavior.
Now, you have got to start acting more human.
But I was.
I saw a Laurel and Hardy movie where Laurel splinked Hardy, then Hardy went, "There's another fine mess.
Hmm".
Then he threw a bucket of water on Hardy.
Laurel and Hardy aren't human.
I mean, they were human, but  Just promise me that you won't do any more splinking or lying.
I promise.
I didn't think you'd mind getting wet.
Look at me.
I'm dripping!
My clothes are soggy, and my skin is all wet.
I hate getting wet.
I'm going to go take a shower.
But wait, I made a sandwich for you.
It's untouched by human hands.
Now, if you want to get Fleetwood Mac, I think this album's your best bet, 'cause it's got just about everything you want to hear All right, all right, where's your father?
In one minute, Mr. Wanker.
I happen to be helping a customer.
$5.98?
If you really want to help your customer, tell him he can get the same album for only $4.50 at the music store right down the street.
No, wait a minute.
That's a mistake.
There is no music store down the street.
Mr. Wanker, you are an absolute Absolutely wonderful to see you here, Arnold.
Isn't it, dear?
Well, it isn't wonderful to see you.
I've tried everything short of tear gas to get rid of you.
In a minute!
That's my wife.
I asked her to drive me to a foreclosure this afternoon.
Oh, well, I guess you need some sort of social life.
And speaking of foreclose, your rent payment is due Friday.
Today is Wednesday.
Oh, I'll have the money.
In spite of the fact that you've nearly ruined our business by tearing up our sidewalk and turning off the heat.
It's like an icebox in here.
I thought you wanted a rent freeze.
Oh, I love my work.
Oh, shut up!
I'm coming!
I've got to use the phone.
Where is it?
Oh, I know where I'd like it to be.
Yeah, around his neck.
Oh, um, it's over there.
He's already turned off the heat.
You want him to turn off the lights next?
I don't care.
This guy's been getting away with this for years.
Somebody's got to tell him.
But do we have to do it now?
Chambers!
I am sick and tired of calling you about this!
I want him evicted tomorrow!
Well, so what if he's 90 years old.
Tell him to start for the door today.
Hold on, you old bat!
Oh, that's the trouble with people today!
They're just too impatient!
Now, that is enough.
Now, wait I don't care somebody's got to tell him off.
Mr. Wanker, you have been evicting people and screaming at people and being nasty.
Do you hear me, Mr. Wanker?
Whoa!
I think he's dead.
MRS.
WANKER : Oh, Arnold!
Oh, Arnold.
Oh, try to take it easy, Mrs. Wanker.
Oh, I knew it was coming.
The doctor told him to take it easy, but no.
He wouldn't listen.
Arnold  Oh, now Calm down, Annie.
When he left the car When he left the car, little did I know that his last words to me would be "Wait here".
Oh, Cora.
I feel terrible about this!
Yeah, I know, but there's nothing we can do about it now.
I know, but those awful things we were saying to him.
He brought this on himself.
Then why do I feel so guilty?
For the same reason I do because he died right here in our store.
We did everything we could, but I'm afraid he's gone.
Oh, well, thank you.
I guess you can go now.
I'll call the mortuary.
Right.
We'll leave the deceased back there, then.
Uh Right.
Come on, Eddie.
Oh Nice suits I'd like to see the rest of the band.
Oh, it's gonna be a bummer, though, trying to find shoes to match that bag.
Watch out for the hole!
My experiment with the pigeons worked.
They agreed to everything I said.
Cheer up.
You look like somebody died.
Who's the grouch?
Mork, will you just be quiet and act like a human being?
How's that?
Shh!
She just lost her husband.
It'll be all right.
He'll turn up.
He just died.
Oh, yeah.
He died?
Oh, no.
The embarrassment.
Genuine look of grief.
He was such a wonderful man.
Don't you think so?
Oh, well, I didn't know him all that well.
We really never Oh, I-I knew him very well.
I didn't know him at all.
Uh, when we were in Little League, he used to come around with free lemonade for all the kids.
Oh.
He puts locks on all the bathrooms.
Grandma was telling me what a bright, observant little boy he was.
She said that she just wanted to give him everything.
Half of everything.
Oh, thank you.
You've made me feel so much better.
Why is it the young always die good?
Arnold Wanker was one in a million.
He was a beautiful man.
He was a real wurble.
He was an inspiration.
He was an angel.
He is now.
Oh, yes, he's an angel Oh, no, no.
What Grandma meant was a man that good and that loved and that admired must certainly have found a heavenly place for himself.
Oh.
Thank you, Mindy.
You really cared about him, didn't you?
Oh, well, I think I'm safe in saying that Dad, Grandma and I all felt the same way about him.
He was beautiful.
Who would believe it?
Who would believe it?
A few minutes ago, he was here, yelling at us, and now, he's back there, quiet as a mouse.
He's back there?
He's only been there for a few minutes?
Yeah, that's right.
Oh.
Annie  Annie Annie, dear, why don't I drive you home?
Now, come along, dear.
Okay.
Now, everything is going to be all right.
I'll stay with her for a few hours.
It's the least I can do.
Yeah.
Poor woman.
Yeah.
Her only mistake was in marrying an idiot.
Yes.
Anybody can make that mistake.
My own daughter did.
Dad, do you think that we might have overdone it a little bit?
Oh, I don't know.
We were just telling her what she wanted to hear.
I wonder where Mork went.
He probably saw a flying saucer and thought it was a class reunion.
You lucky Earthlings!
Do you think you could tone down the exuberance a little bit?
There's no need to be sad anymore.
Mork, a man is dead.
A lot you know.
What?
!
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive Stayin' alive But he's supposed to be dead.
Not anymore.
I gave him a jump start.
A jump start?
You can do that?
Well, it's a billion in one shot.
I did it once on Ork with a, uh, a hairless crawling zabedee.
Who would know it would work with a lower form of life.
Conditions were perfect, though.
You see, he's still a little groggy.
I know this will work 'cause I saw it during the movies watch.
: Wake up, sweetheart.
And furthermore, McConnell, I'm going to get you to break that lease if I have to break your legs to do it!
Now, now, now, uh, let me get this straight.
Conditions have to be perfect?
It's a one in a million shot?
One in a billion.
You don't think you can ever do it again?
Eh And you wasted it on that miserable rat!
But he's your friend.
Friend, my word.
I can't stand him.
But you said all those nice things about him.
I lied!
Oh.
You?
Then you lied, too?
Oh, I didn't exactly lie.
I just didn't exactly tell the truth.
What's the difference?
Well, the difference is lying is lying, and not telling the truth is lying.
You're right; I lied.
But you told me lying was bad.
You made me promise never to lie or even splink.
That stupid woman!
I I don't know why I married her!
Now I told her to wait.
Now, I got to call a cab!
Uh, Arnold, uh, there was a very good reason why she left.
Well, I'd like to know what it is.
Well, you were, um uh, uh Let me see if I can put it delicately.
Just say it quickly.
Well, you were, uh You bit the big one.
Boot Hill, Great White Hunting Ground.
You bought the farm, you kicked the bucket.
What is this dodo trying to say?
He's trying to say you were dead.
Arnold, you had a heart attack right here in the store.
Heart attack?
Ha!
How come I don't remember it?
Well, think back.
What do you remember?
Well, I was on the phone evicting some I remember my, uh, wife honking the car horn.
I, uh, remember overcharging my fraternity for the beer, and then I pulled the lemonade trick on the Little League, and then I caught my baby-sitter doing Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Wait a minute.
My whole life flashed in front of my eyes.
Right.
That was just before you  You're all crazy.
This is some kind of trick to keep me from breaking the lease, isn't it?
Well, it just won't work.
Excuse me, sir.
Can you tell me where the loved one is?
What loved one?
We are supposed to pick up one Arnold Winker, deceased.
That's Arnold Wanker, deceased.
Only I'm not deceased, I'm alive.
And I'm going to stay that way for a long, long time.
No pickup.
Watch out!
for the hole.
You know, actually, Arnold Wanker really lucked out.
I mean, in that terrible fall, all he broke was both legs and his collarbone.
But the good news is he'll be in traction for months.
And knowing him, he'll probably sue himself.
I'm sorry about yesterday, but after you said all those nice things about him, I thought you'd be happy when I brought him back.
Oh, it isn't your fault, Mork.
I guess I confused you with my speech on lying and splinking.
Yes, it was very confusing to hear you lie after all that.
Yeah.
I should have explained to you about something called "little white lies".
All splinks are blue.
A little white lie is what you tell when you don't want to hurt somebody's feelings.
But how could you hurt Wanker's feeling?
He was Croak City.
But I really would have hurt his wife's feelings if I had told the truth.
So, I just sort of bent it a little.
A little?
All right, I stretched it a lot.
Ah, so I see on Earth, the truth gets a lot of exercise.
Yeah, but as a rule, you should always tell the truth.
I should never lie?
Never.
Hi.
Oh!
Oh, I'm so glad you kids are home.
Now, I've been invited to the Gray Panthers Prom for next Sunday, and I want you to see my new dress.
Whoa!
Oh!
Author.
Grandma, it's really colorful.
Well, what I really wanted was a man's opinion.
Mork, splink like you have never splunk.
Mork?
Que wapa!
Cordoba Corinthian.
: Oh!
Oh, do you really like it?
Huevos rancheros, amigo.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
I hear you, Mork.
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. Universe and all ships in space.
Let's go to press.
Dit dit-dit-dit de-de de-de-de.
Flash!
File the report, Mork.
Aw, but you take all the fun out of it.
The report!
Yes, your Immenseness.
Today's report is about little white lies.
What?
They're the same as little blue splinks.
See, there are several kinds of white lies.
Number one, the sports lie.
I'm tellin' you, Harry, you should have seen the one that got away.
I'm talkin' big big.
You know, so big, it almost swamped the dingy.
Then, there are vanity lies.
How old are you, Mrs. Vandergroff?
: I'm only 28 years old.
Then, there are the kind of lies to keep you from getting your lips ripped off.
: Barbara Jean, that was the best meal I've ever had.
Who could believe it was the first one you've ever cooked?
I've never seen anybody do that with figs before.
The secret must be in the cheese.
: That's the way it is here on Earth.
Until next week : this is Mork signing off.
Nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Mork, where are you?
Are you?
Oh, hi.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.
Are you just getting up now?
Oh, I've been up for several hours.
I had to make my report to Orson.
Huh all that time, huh?
Well, he put me on hold.
: Oh.
Then you don't know.
Look, it's snowing outside.
Shazbot!
The sky is falling, the sky is falling!
Mayday!
Mayday!
Take evasive action.
You get under there with the baby.
You don't have a baby too bad.
They were going to scoff at Chicken Little, but they're not laughing now.
That little sucker's gonna make a lot of money off this.
I've got to call him, I've got to call Just my luck he's unlisted.
Mork, calm down.
It's just snow.
It's perfectly harmless.
It is?
Yeah.
Boy, do I feel like a flake.
Hey, where'd you learn that story about "the sky is falling"?
Well, I was baby-sitting for Eugene, and, uh, he told me that story just before I fell asleep.
Oh, well, if you'd heard that story all the way through, you would have understood the point.
See, Chicken Little thought an acorn dropped on his head, and because of that he thought the sky was falling, and that means that he was gullible.
That was the point.
Oh, therefore, if I think the sky is falling, ipso facto, I am gullible.
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
Like yesterday, when you heard that TV commercial that said to run out and catch a bus, and you started building a trap.
Oh.
I would've caught one, too.
I was going to use a segregated school as bait.
Well, I have a surprise for you.
Oh, surprise, surprise!
Don't tell me, oh, don't tell me.
Let me guess.
Cuff links!
Come on.
Come on, you know what's in there.
You gave me the money to buy it for you yourself.
Hey, don't rain on my parade.
Let's see, let's see, let's Boy, a coat!
Just what I've always wanted.
Oh Come on, you should put it on and get dressed and go out and observe the snow.
It'll be a whole new experience.
Are you sure those sky flakes won't bash my brains out?
I promise you it's perfectly safe.
Come here, I want to show you something.
Okay.
: Don't be afraid.
Look.
Whoa.
It's cold and beautiful.
Yeah.
And not housebroken.
Dad, Dad, he's become very responsible lately.
Y-Yeah, he was responsible for that.
He-He was responsible for that, too, yeah.
Now, that wasn't his fault, Dad.
Well, it was an old cat, anyway.
Oh, I got to go; somebody's at the door.
Okay, okay, yeah, I will.
All right, bye-bye.
: Mork!
Oh, what happened?
Where have you been?
Dashing through the snow.
Oh!
Oh, ah, oh Oh, come on in; you're frozen.
Sit down and warm up.
Shazbot, I'm frigid!
Ow!
Ah, uh, oh, I'm melting!
Mork, what happened to your new coat?
I gave it away.
What?
!
You gave away your brand-new coat?
Well, the man I gave it to didn't have any, and I have two.
Besides, I had to pay him back.
He gave me a sip out of his paper bag.
Oh, Mork.
Look, you shouldn't give away your belongings like that.
Monty Hall does.
Oh I saw him give $1,000 to two sweaty avocados.
That's a game show.
Don't you see, that man took advantage of your generosity.
Mork, you've got to learn how to say no.
Do you understand?
No!
Just practicing.
I'll get it.
No!
Nein!
Mm-mmm!
No way, baby, not me, mm-mmm.
Hiya, mister.
Would you like to buy some cookies?
No!
How was that?
That was deplorable.
Thank you.
Mork, how could you slam the door in that poor little girl's face?
Well, she was selling cookies, and I didn't want any.
Mork, nobody wants those cookies.
But you don't, you don't slam the door in a little girl's face.
Oh  Okay, buster, so much for the soft sell.
Look, chump, this is for charity, you know.
If you don't buy, some sweet little kid doesn't go to camp namely me.
And we don't make diddley on these crackers unless we sell volume.
And we need big bucks.
Am I getting through to you, Bright Eyes?
I'll take a box.
Not good enough.
Two boxes.
That wouldn't buy my sweat socks.
Mork, don't get carried away.
I can't; all I've got is three bucks.
You'll owe me the rest.
Mork, you let that little girl trick you out of your money.
Uh-uh, not me.
I played a trick on her.
I've got a dollar left.
Shazbot, it's in my new coat.
But seriously, you know, I met a girl.
Now I'm not going to say she's incredible, but, you know, yada-yada.
And that was just her head.
: What are you doing?
My drum shtick.
Well, you can stay here and play the drum if you want.
I'm gonna beat it.
Ha-ha-ha.
Humor.
I got to go to the bank, so I'll be back in five minutes, okay?
Take as long as you want.
You're in good hands with Orkstate.
Now, that's humor.
I'll see you later.
Oh, excuse me.
Mork, help him out.
Excuse me, what're ya what the heck you doing?
I'm helping you out.
That's the last time I ever come in here to get warm.
Hold it!
I tell you, you got the wrong guy.
That's a gross prevarication.
Put your hand through here.
I've apprehended you, and I shall apprehend your partner forthwith.
I'm off to pursue his accomplice.
Keep an eye on this one.
What are you doing?
Keeping my eye on you.
Hey, back off.
I'm in no mood for jokes.
I've had a real crummy day.
Sorry to hear about that.
What happened?
Well, it started off pretty good.
I escaped from prison.
Everything's been downhill since then.
Oh, prison I know about that.
That's where you get free clothes, free food, no rent.
Sounds better the way you put it.
I really didn't like being in there.
Why did you go?
Well, it's a long story.
As a kid, I was a shoplifter.
Boy, you must be strong.
No, it was mostly small stuff.
And then I started stealing cars, and they finally caught me, and here I am.
Boy, I feel really bad.
I never stole a car, and here I am, too.
Yeah, I, uh, I wanted to get out one last time to see my poor sick mother.
You have a mother?
Yeah.
Now I guess I'll never see her again.
Choke.
Gasp.
Look of sincere empathy.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Well, you could get me out of these handcuffs and let me go.
Oh, I'd be glad to.
Every son should see his mother.
Wish I had one, but Hey, wait, doesn't that policeman want you to stay here?
Oh, I'll be back.
Don't worry about that.
You promise?
Cross my heart and hope to die.
You're sure the policeman won't mind?
He won't give it a second thought.
Trust me.
And I'll be back by, say, uh Kay-o.
How did you do that?
It's kind of like a card trick, but I do it with molecules.
That's incredible.
Never mind, uh, uh, thanks, buddy.
Uh, see you around.
Say hi to Mom for me.
That reminds me.
I'm a little short on cash.
Could you loan me ten bucks?
Ten dollars what do you think, I'm gullible?
: Here, here's five.
Get out of here!
Mork, Mork, did you hear what's going on?
A cop is chasing a couple of escaped criminals.
I know.
He brought one in here and tried to tie him up with this metal thing.
Where is he?
I let him go.
You what?
I hate to blow my own horn.
Blow your own horn?
!
Well, if you insist.
: Thank you, baby, thank you.
What's wrong with him?
Oh, the doctor put some drops in my eyes, and I can't see a thing, but I'll be back to normal in a couple of hours.
In the meantime, do you want to have some fun?
Let's let go of him and watch him bump into the wall.
Dad, you're never going to guess what Mork just did.
Uh, do we have to notify next of kin?
A policeman caught an escaped criminal, and Mork just set him free.
What?
: A policeman caught an escaped criminal, and Mork just set him free!
Well, why in the world would you release an escaped criminal?
Excuse uh : Because he wanted me to!
Stop shouting, stop shouting.
For goodness sakes.
Mork, this is serious.
I don't know why everybody's so upset.
He said he'd turn himself in tomorrow.
He lied to you, Mork.
Oh, I don't think so.
He never lied to me before.
Besides, he said he wanted to get out of prison to see his sick mother.
And you bought that?
I don't think he'd sell his mother.
Mork, how could you believe that?
I sense that you're mad at me.
Yes, you're getting warmer.
Oh, Mork, I'm not mad at you.
It's, it's just that you're too trusting.
And that's bad?
It is.
Trust me.
Mork, you see, you let an escaped prisoner get away.
Why, uh, that's a crime.
His cohort got away, but I presume one jailbird in the hand is worth Where is he?
Now, where's who?
The prisoner I had handcuffed right here.
Oh, why, uh, he got away.
Uh, Mork had nothing to do with it.
And I'm an eyewitness to that.
I can understand what you're trying to do.
You're trying to protect me, but I can't let you take the coat for me.
The rap.
Your planet.
I let your prisoner go.
Young man, what you did wasn't nice.
You released my suspect.
Boy, am I perturbed.
I should strike you about the head and shoulders.
What're you going to do?
I'm taking him in for aiding and abetting an escaped prisoner.
Oh You need these.
Oh, you've been there before, huh?
Don't worry, Mindy.
It'll be all right.
He'll come back.
I know he will.
Oh, Mork.
He was real happy when he left.
Mork, the judge'll be ready for your preliminary hearing in about a half an hour.
Thanks, Officer Bob.
Sure.
Come on, fellas.
The judge is ready to give you guys your sentences now.
I have a sentence for you.
Uh, vamonos, meshuggeners.
I hate to tell you guys this, uh, but you got the hanging judge, and he's in a bad mood.
Have a nice day.
Thanks, Mork.
Don't push!
We're going, we're going.
Come along, my brothers.
He's a non-believer.
All we can do is forgive him.
You're going to crowd all of us in this one tiny cell?
Ciao.
Exidor, is that you?
Mork?
Is that you?
Where are you?
I'm over here!
Step aside!
I can't see!
Ah!
There you are.
Mork, my old friend.
Exidor, why are you in jail?
Religious persecution.
Why are you here?
I set a criminal free.
Why did you do that?
That's against the law.
Well, he said he had to get out to see his sick mother, and he promised he'd be back today.
Excuse me, Mork.
As my dear father would say, you're a pea brain!
But I know he'll come back.
He promised.
Mork, the man lied to you, just as those crummy Venusians lied to me.
I know.
You can't trust a man with four lips.
All you get is double-talk.
They promised me they were coming down to destroy the Earth on Labor Day.
They let me down.
Bummer.
Sorry to hear that.
It was then I realized that my faith had been misplaced, and I began my quest for truth.
I tried Buddhism, Catholicism, Judaism, Punch and Judaism but nothing worked for me until I found Him!
Who?
Mork I worship O.J. Simpson!
Isn't he a football player?
A football player?
Mork, he is the football player.
Tell me, did you ever see the Reverend Ike streak down the sidelines untouched?
Did you ever see Billy Graham snake over from the two?
Did you ever see Oral Roberts juke a linebacker out of his socks?
Sure, Moses walked across the Red Sea, but could he have done it on Astroturf?
Mork, I believe in the Juice.
You, too, can be a born-again Simpson.
Let O.J. show you the way.
Just look at my followers.
Look at the peace and serenity in their eyes.
There's Isaiah Hi.
Merlin Howdy.
Too Tall Whoa Bubba My man.
These, Mork, are my conversions.
Conversions good for one point.
You know, Mork, before I found O.J., I couldn't laugh this easily.
He can do the same for you as he's done for me.
Join us, Mork.
Follow us to the Promised Land.
San Francisco?
Yea, verily, Candlestick Park.
Oh, I see believe, and ye shall bear oranges.
Praise Anita!
Yes!
Mork, I want you to renounce your sins against football.
Exidor, I watched the World Series.
Oh, blasphemy!
The World Series?
Baseball is pagan.
Do ten Hike Marys.
And I look up to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Ah, do a hundred push-ups.
And I hate to say this I like Howard Cosell.
Let us pray.
Hut, hut, hut!
Amen.
Do you mind not smoking?
This man is having a religious experience.
Are you feeling it, Mork?
No.
Do you feel it now?
No.
Do you feel it now?
!
Whoa!
Praise football!
Give me that old-time football Give me that old-time football It's good enough for me.
Sunday in San Francisco.
Some good and glorious happenings.
Can you hear it now?
Tell me, brother.
Now O.J. takes the ball on the seven now, runs it 30 yards, but, oh, no, clipping now, clipping now, can you feel that clipping now?
15 yards, 15 yards.
O.J. takes the ball again, and a hole opens up before him now.
He's on the 50 now, on the 40 now, on the 30 now, on the 20 now, on the ten now, and he goes in!
Salvation!
Beg for mercy!
Oh, oh, Mork!
You're a true believer, Mork!
I hate to disappoint you, Exidor, but I don't have much faith in football, and O.J.'s just a man, and football's just a game.
Blasphemy!
Mork you've just fouled out in the game of life!
May you burn in Buffalo!
Oh, Mork!
Oh, Mork Good-bye.
Oh, we tried to bail you out, but they won't let us until the preliminary hearing.
Bail me out why, am I leaking?
How was your night in jail?
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.
Oh, what trouble?
Nobody knows.
Has he showed up yet?
Mork, that guy he escaped from prison.
Now, why would he want to go back?
Because he said he wanted to see his sick mother.
Oh, his poor sick mother.
When it comes to trust, he's full of it!
He's crazy, you know.
But don't just take it from us.
Excuse me, I have to break up a fight.
Bubba!
Too Tall!
Break it up!
Huddle on the 15!
I'll be all right.
He promised he'd be back by 2:00.
Well, there's your proof.
It's after 2:30 right now.
It is?
Yeah.
But he promised.
I did him a favor.
Boy, I really Orked it up this time.
Oh, I guess you've proven your point.
I should never trust anyone anymore.
Sorry I'm late Mom got thirsty, so I knocked over a liquor store.
Just kidding.
A little slammer humor.
Hi, Mork.
Mom says "Hi" and "Thanks".
Oh, you're welcome.
Do I get out now?
No.
You still committed a crime but due to the extenuating circumstances, I'll have a dialogue with the adjudicator, and I think you will be, as the street people put it, extricated.
I don't understand.
Why'd you turn yourself in?
I promised him.
Just because I'm a thief doesn't mean I'm a liar.
I couldn't let him get in trouble for helpin' me.
He's the only one that's trusted me except Mom, and she hides her jewelry.
You're late for practice, Whitey.
You know, Dad, maybe we've become too cynical.
Maybe we get what we expect out of people.
There's an old Orkan phrase about that: "If one cannot trust oneself, then one cannot trust another".
Oh, that's nice.
I'm not finished.
"And if one cannot trust another, "then others cannot trust another, "and then others cannot trust others, and finally, who can one trust"?
Uh, does everybody on Ork talk like that?
Well, we don't have sex.
We've got to do something.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Hello, this is Orson.
You'll have to call back later, because I'm out of my mind right now.
If you like, you may leave a message between the two beeps.
Hi, Orson.
This is Mork.
I just called to say that   Hello, Mork.
Sorry I was busy.
What were you doing?
Taking a meteor shower?
Mork, will you be serious?
Sorry, O Fattest of All Living Things.
This week, I learned about a popular Earth religion.
Believe it or not, some life-forms here worship O.J. Simpson.
The Juice?
Yes, and even the Gentiles.
Is that the only religion on Earth?
No, there's several others, but the main difference is that football services are held on Sunday afternoon instead of the morning.
Don't Earthlings need a common belief to unite them?
Oh, they have that.
They all believe they can't trust one another.
Why do they feel that way?
I guess they're afraid of being hurt.
Too bad they don't make football pads for the heart.
This is Mork, signing off from Boulder, Colorado.
Until next week, nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Say, I like your place.
Mmm thanks You know, I wasn't sure you'd ever want to see me again.
Now, Dan, do I look like the type of girl who would hold a little thing like a broken engagement against you?
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you do say will be held against you Mindy, Mindy, I didn't mean to hurt you.
I just wasn't ready to settle down.
Then why did you ask me to marry you?
Well, I was young.
I didn't know what I wanted.
I have to admit I was surprised that you called.
I thought that you were probably out sowing your wild oats.
Well, now I think I'm more interested in rice.
Uh, which reminds me, there's a new Japanese restaurant I'd like to try for lunch tomorrow.
How does that sound to you?
I'd love it.
Good.
I'll, uh, pick you up at noon.
Okay.
Then noon it is.
Thanks for goin' out, Mindy.
Well, thanks for asking me out, Dan.
It was fun.
It always was.
Tomorrow.
Bye.
Mindy!
Mork!
How was your mating?
Dating!
That's dating.
Oh.
And it was wonderful.
Dan took me to this great Danish restaurant.
Sounds interesting.
What do great Danes eat?
And he's taking me to lunch tomorrow, too.
What is it about this earthling that makes you so hungry?
Well, Dan and I are old friends.
As a matter of fact, our relationship had gotten pretty serious at one time.
Serious.
Ah, sounds like you need cheering up.
Come see my apartment.
I've just redecorated the attic, and it's scamp city and totally taste-free!
Come on!
What do you think?
Well, what can I say except it's you?
You like my bed?
You sleep on that?
Oh, it's not bad once you get the hang of it.
What's this?
Oh, it's a hide-a-bed for houseguests.
Now, I must say, I've never seen a lamp sticking out of the wall quite like that.
I like to read in bed.
Well, Mork, this place certainly is designed for your kind of living.
What an interesting wall covering!
It's grass.
Mork, why do you have grass on your wall?
Oh, the plants kept falling off.
Can I get you something to sit on?
Here, here's my footstool.
Now, that's a great idea!
A footstool shaped like a foot.
Wait'll you see the end tables I've ordered.
Well, Mork, I think you've done a fabulous job.
It looks really good.
What's this?
It looks like some sort of a calculator or something.
Oh, no, it's not a calculator.
It's an Orkan Age Machine.
A what?
Actually, it's a small computer designed to alter our brain waves so we can achieve any age we want.
Uh, why would you want to do that?
Well, if you're suffering from tension or feeling uptight, you set it for a certain age, set that, and it's like a vacation, kinda like our version of Fantasy Island.
You know, "Boss, the plane has landed".
You're kidding.
Ah, "kidding", no.
That would be button 3.
Give it a go!
Okay.
: No, I don't want your cooties.
: Wow!
Come on!
All the other kids are in hyperspace.
I just want the keys to the egg.
It'd be really right on.
Where's Dave?
Whoa, I didn't know it went that far back.
Well, thanks for taking me to lunch, Dan.
How about dinner?
Do you realize how many restaurants we've been to in these last three weeks?
Uh, I see you're on to me.
You've figured out that I'm trying to get at your heart through your stomach.
Maybe that's why I like you so much.
Most guys immediately want to take the scenic route.
Hi, Dan.
Hi, Mr. M. Uh, pick you up at 8:00?
Okay, I'll be ready.
All right, uh good-bye.
Excuse me.
I'd turn sideways, but I haven't got one.
Hi Mindy!
How are you?
Oh, Sally!
Well, I see you're still hangin' in there!
Yeah.
I feel just like the Post Office.
Neither of us deliver on time.
Well, hello, Sally, dear.
Can we do anything for you?
Yeah, you could tell me if my shoes match.
Well, have you put in your request for a boy or a girl?
Well, Cora, what difference does it make?
With a mother like Sally that baby's gonna be beautiful either way.
Oh, what a lovely thing to say.
Just for that, if it's a boy, I'm gonna name him after you.
Fascinating!
A boy called Weiner!
Oh, Cora Uh, nice to see you, Sally.
You, too.
Listen, you wouldn't happen to have The Little Engine That Could?
I don't know.
Let me check in the children's section.
Oh, good.
You know, Sally, you look absolutely radiant.
Oh, come on.
You do.
I don't think I've ever seen you look this good.
It's motherhood.
You oughta try it sometime.
Well, maybe I will sometime.
I like kids, but I don't think I'm ready to be a mother yet.
Oh Mindy Oh, who's your fat friend?
Mork!
Oh, parallel universe!
What a coincidence!
My name's Mork, too.
Na-nu, na-nu!
Um, Sally Freeman, this is my friend, Mork.
And Sally isn't fat; she's pregnant.
Oh, that's wonderful.
What's pregnant?
Didn't your parents ever tell you anything?
I don't have any parents.
I'm a test tube baby.
That's Mork.
Always with the jokes.
I just felt a kick!
Somebody kicked you?
Must have been hit-and-run.
Mork, her baby kicked her.
Why, what did she do to it?
She didn't do anything to it.
A baby always kicks when it's inside its mother.
There's a baby in there!
You're tryin' to jive my socks off!
There's a real live  Whoa, shazbat!
Kids get in the darndest places.
I can't wait till he's born so I can see what he looks like.
I'll bet he's round.
Sally, do you think that you'll go back to work after you have the baby?
No, Mindy, I want to do all that hokey stuff.
You know, I want to build blocks and play peek-a-boo and take him for walks in the park, watch him grow up.
That's gonna be my career.
Oh, that's really nice.
Well, here's your record.
It's on the house.
It's, uh, a birthday present.
Oh, thanks a lot.
I'll see you later, Mindy.
Oh, good luck.
So long, Mork.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Oh Whew Oh, you know, Mork, I really envy Sally.
She really knows what she wants.
And I envy her baby.
You envy her baby?
Why?
It has something I never had a mother.
Oh Good night, Mindy.
Good night, Dan.
Bye.
What are you doing up so late?
Something was bothering me.
I couldn't sleep.
So I decided I'd relax by soaking in a hot tub.
Oh.
Yeah, that's what I always do.
Oh, Mork, is there anything you want to talk about?
Mork, what are you doing?
Mork!
On Earth you don't soak your head in a tub like that.
You soak your feet!
Are you kidding?
If I soak my feet in there, I wouldn't last five minutes!
Well, do you want to tell me what the problem is?
All right.
Come on.
Sit down.
Ever since I met your friend Sally, I I always thought I was raised in the best possible way.
Oh, how were you raised?
By a computer.
Computer!
Oh, yes.
Her name was Nannivac 30.
But all the 8,000 kids in our warehouse used to just call her "Nanny".
Every bleem she'd wash me, feed me, burp me, take care of all my needs.
Did she change you, too?
Well, I'm a better person for having known her.
But somehow after seeing Sally and how happy she was, I feel like I'm missing something.
Oh, Mork, you missed being loved.
But Nanny was always there.
Every morning I'd roll past her on the conveyer belt.
She'd pick me up in her warm little metal claws, tickle me under the chin with a high-intensity laser and sing in that soft little voice  If that's not love, what is it?
Factory servicing.
Doesn't an Earth mother do the very same thing?
Well, yeah, but she does it because she wants to, not because she's plugged in.
Oh, I see.
On Earth then, a mother's a very important job, too.
Oh, yeah.
I don't know a job more important.
Do you want to have babies someday?
Well, you know, I I didn't think I did, but I think I might, yeah.
How about tomorrow?
Mork, it isn't that easy.
I'll help.
Mork, I think there's something that you and I should talk about.
Oh, if it's about having babies, I know all about that.
First the bird lands and adds the pollen.
No.
You see, Mork, Dan has asked me to be his wife.
Dan!
That guy you've been eating around with?
Did you say yes?
No Whew hey But I think I'm going to.
Oh I'm very happy for you.
Mindy, what's on your brain?
I'm about to be married and I I feel like I just might be biting off more than I can chew.
Ooh, sounds like a marriage on Alpha Centauri.
There the bride and the groom eat the best man.
They eat the best man?
Ah, but it's done in good taste, though.
I'm sure it is.
Oh, Mork, I I'm worried.
I just don't know what it would be like to have a child.
Yeah, and I'm sad because I don't know what it would be like to have a mother.
Well, at least I've got a way of finding out.
Wait.
I have a way we both can find out.
I'll set my age machine for three years old  for ten minutes.
That way I'll be your baby  and you'll be my  : Mommy!
Mommy, hold me!
Hold me!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
That was fun.
Let's do it again.
No, No, Mork, you're too heavy for that.
Me Morky, you Mommy.
No, me Mindy.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Aha.
Look here.
I know where my belly button is.
Oh, that's that's nice.
Can I see yours?
No!
Come on, Mork, now give me your age machine.
No, it's mine!
Now, Morky, Dan is gonna be here any minute and it'll be embarrassing to have a giant three- year-old running around, so give me your age machine.
No, no!
Can't get it!
Can't get it!
Na, na, weiner, weiner, weiner!
Now, come on.
Now you listen, young man, you give me that age machine right now.
That's Dan.
Morky, Mommy has company so why don't you take a nice nap?
No.
Morky not sleepy.
I wanna stay up all night and drive Mommy shazbot.
Nyah, nyah, n-nyah!
If Morky takes a nap, Mommy'll make him his favorite treat, and he knows what that is.
A baloney sundae!
Yay!
Oh, nice toys.
Nice toys.
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
Shh.
I'll let you play with these if you promise to be quiet.
Promise?
Yeah.
Okay, you be good.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Hi.
Let's go.
Hi.
What's the rush?
The movie doesn't start for an hour.
Oh.
Sure, come on in.
Oh Oh, is that for me?
Uh, no, that is for our firstborn.
Dan, that's a little premature.
I haven't even made my mind up yet.
Oh, you will.
Did you hear that?
It's probably squirrels.
Oh.
Anyway, when we get married, it is going to be so great.
I can hardly wait to hear the pitter-patter of little feet.
Say, uh, are you sure we're alone?
Well, yes.
Oh, no, uh there's a plumber in the attic.
It, uh looks like your plumber broke his necklace.
Yeah, well, I sure am glad he got those out of the pipes.
Uh, I'll just go up and see if he found the earrings, too.
Mork.
Mork : Morky, where are you?
That is not funny.
Now come out of there.
You broke my pearls and rolled them all down the stairs.
Not all.
Now, Mork, you promised to be quiet.
: But I am being quiet!
Shh!
No, you're  No, you're not.
Yes, I am!
Yes, I am!
Yes, I am!
Shh!
So there.
Besides I have nothing quiet to do and I'm not a mime.
Why don't why don't you just play?
Can I play dress-up?
Mindy?
Uh, coming, Dan.
I don't care what you play but just play quiet.
Yay!
A dog for a day, yay!
Mork, just play quiet.
Okay?
Okay?
Answer me.
: You said be quiet!
Shh!
Just play quiet.
Now, shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Kids.
Is everything fixed?
Well, uh, no, but everything will be back to normal in about, uh, six minutes.
You know, it sounds like you've got a plumber that's not too experienced.
Oh, he isn't.
But only the young ones will make house calls.
Here, I picked up your pearls.
You know, when we have kids you can't leave those laying around.
They'll put them in their mouths.
I've heard.
You know, I think I want about ten.
Ten kids?
!
That's inconceivable.
No, no, kids are great.
They are so much fun.
Just a joy to have around.
The, uh, plumber is crying?
Oh, uh, he brought his kid with him because he, uh, couldn't find a baby-sitter, so, uh, just wait here.
Oh, what happened?
Mommy, hurt.
Boo-boo.
Oh There, there.
No.
No.
Here, here.
Oh It's gonna be all right.
It'll be all right.
Tell me what happened.
Moo-moo bit me!
And then he came down, he attacked my knee.
Bad!
Oh, you're right.
Bad moo-moo for hurting Morky.
There, Moo-Moo won't hurt you anymore.
Mommy, Mommy, you're protecting me against a bad moo-moo.
Yeah, now come over here and sit down.
I'll find something to dry your tears.
Morky Mommy can't dry your tears if you're sitting on them.
There, there.
There.
Now everything's okay.
Will you always protect me and take care of me?
Well, I will until you're old enough to take care of yourself.
Which will be in about one minute.
Uh, now, Mommy has to go downstairs if you're all right.
I'm all right.
I'm a big boy.
Okay, now, you be good.
Yeah.
I gotta go potty.
Number three.
The plumber's okay now.
I mean, I cheered up his kid.
Say, you're a real plumber's helper.
MORK : Oh, humor.
Aah, aah.
He has a well-developed sense of humor.
Well, he's kinda old for his age.
Let's go.
Mommy!
Oh, toys.
Mommy!
: Good-bye, Mommy.
Good-bye, Mommy.
: Good-bye, Mindy.
Well, good night, Mindy.
Well, good-bye, Dan.
Oh, good-bye.
You must've fallen asleep while watching TV.
If I was asleep, then the TV was watching me.
How was your movie?
We didn't go to the movies.
We just, uh, talked.
Actually, Dan talked, I listened.
I told him I'm not gonna marry him, Mork.
Bummer.
I guess you'll have to rent babies then.
No, that was just the point.
All night long Dan just kept talking about babies and then I realized that he never talked about us.
He wasn't into having a wife as much as he wanted a family.
And I want to be a couple before I'm a group.
I'm sorry you lost your husband.
Did my becoming a child affect your decision?
Well, I have to admit it opened my eyes.
It's hard to be a mother.
Yeah, it's pretty tough being a kid, too.
But you made it easy.
You know something?
You're gonna make a terrific mother.
Oh, Mork.
A toast.
To motherhood?
Maybe.
To chickens with lips.
Mork calling Orson Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
What did you learn about Earth this time, Mork?
For one thing, on Earth, babies aren't grown in test tubes.
They're grown in something wonderful called a mother.
That's the old- fashioned way, Mork.
did it up here, too, as part of a nostalgia craze.
Sometimes I think the old way is the best way, Orson.
Nap, nap.
Our method is much more efficient.
Orson, when you were a baby, don't you remember being held and cuddled, taken for walks?
Nannivac 26 did that.
But on Earth, a mother does it.
And she does all sorts of other nice things for her children for her entire life.
Aw, it's a warm and wonderful thing.
How much does she get paid?
Nothing.
Is it because her work is considered of no real value?
Oh, no, it's because it's considered priceless.
Good night, Mork.
Orson, one more thing.
Can you tell me a bedtime story?
I don't know any.
Too bad.
Good night, Your Immense-ness.
See you next week.
Nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
So this is where you humans come to ingest food?
Well, let's just say that some humans do, yeah.
Don't you have restaurants on Ork?
Oh no, we just eat whatever's in front of us.
That's why we have to picnic back-to-back.
Hey, get a load of the talent that just walked in.
Yeah, that's Mindy McConnell.
Her father runs a music store in the mall.
Who's her handicap?
Uh, I think his name's, uh Mork.
Yeah?
I bet if you yelled in his ear you'd get an echo.
Well, what do you think I should have?
Oh, anything that's on the menu.
Oh, how about this fly?
Whoa!
Talk about your fast food.
No, eat what's written there.
Oh, I think I'll start off with a little sales tax then.
Hi.
Hi.
What would you like?
Uh, world peace, an end to poverty, and a date with Annette Funicello.
Let me know when fun-time is over, okay?
Thank you.
Hey, Marcia, looks like you got a real loser there.
That's right, George.
You been giving him lessons?
Oh Mork, you really need to try to fit in more when we're in public.
I know, I'm slime.
Oh no Why don't you have the Businessman's Lunch?
Why should I have it if he didn't?
Hi there, beautiful.
Hi.
I was talking to Mindy.
Oh.
Oh.
How do you know my name?
I make it my business to get acquainted with every fox in town.
A good way to do that is to leave dead meat on your porch.
This I take it, is Merk?
Oh no, that's a great car.
My name is Mork.
Nanu-nanu.
Well, Mr. Nanu-nanu, if you'll excuse us I'd like to dance with the lady.
No, thank you.
Come on, you'll love it.
No!
Rick, put on some music.
Stop it!
What are you doing?
Cut it out.
Mork, will you do something?
Fine.
I'll order lunch.
Garson?
I can't let you pass up a chance like me, honey.
Stop it.
Mork, will you help me?
If you insist.
Mind if I cut in?
Thank you.
Hey, what are you doing, jerk?
No, it's not the jerk, it's the Orkan Hustle.
See?
Mindy said Mindy said that you needed help dancing.
We don't need help.
Oh, games!
Tag, you're it!
Rick, cut the music.
What did you just do?
I think I just went, tag, you're it.
You better take it back.
Oh, take it back, oh  Mork Relax baby, come here, you'll love it.
Don't cop out.
Oh, cops and robbers, I know how to play that.
Freeze right there, dirtball!
All right, let's go.
Up against the wall.
Quick!
10-4!
10-4!
Quick!
Up against the wall.
We're going to play a little game right now called Hide and Seek, okay?
You're going to close your eyes and count to infinity, right?
Infinity, that's ridiculous!
Come on!
All right, one two, three, four, five, six, seven, Hey, wait!
Eight, nine, ten, 11, twelve  Hey, where'd he go?
What are you laughing at?
That was no gun.
That guy Mork, had his finger in your back.
Yeah?
In that case, he just became an endangered species.
Mindy, I have some questions I'd like to I still have some questions I'd like to ask about this custom of lunch.
What?
When do we eat?
That was not a typical example of lunch on the planet Earth.
It wasn't?
No.
Oh.
For one thing, I don't usually get attacked.
See, I don't like getting attacked.
Why didn't you stop him?
I keep forgetting, you just don't understand, do you?
Look, Mork, that guy was a stupid creep.
Somebody should have made him stop.
Mindy, you don't understand, you see, Orkans abolished violence a long time ago.
We consider it humiliating.
Mork, haven't you ever known someone that you needed to protect?
Well, yes, there was my girlfriend, Zwendira-Mae-Jo-Bob.
Girlfriend?
I thought Orkans had no emotions.
Oh, yes, but we're still assigned someone to go swimming with so we don't drown.
How romantic.
Well, whatever happened to, uh Zwendira-Mae-Jo-Bob.
She was swallowed by a black hole.
Oh, I'm sorry she was killed.
Oh, no, she wasn't killed, she just reappeared four years later eight hundred times thinner.
Look, Mork, I'm not into violence either, but if you're threatened you've got to be able to defend yourself.
The trouble is, you don't understand, do you?
Oh, I know all about violence.
I watch TV.
Here, stand up.
Now, throw a punch at me.
Okay.
Oh!
See?
That's not violence, I didn't even hit you.
Look, violence involves pain.
None of that stuff on TV is real.
Oh, then the Dallas Cowboys are faking it?
No, sports are real.
Whew, what a relief.
I thought you were going to tell me next that wrestling was fake.
This isn't going to work.
Let's see How can I teach you about fighting?
I know we can always get married.
What are you doing?
: Getting in shape-ape-ape-ape.
But you were running so slowly.
I was jogging in another time dimension.
It's a lot healthier, but a lot more exhausting, especially since I haven't been through a time warp in five or six bleems.
Oh, there's the bell.
Oh, Howard, you're so ugly, if you take off that toupee, you'd look like a rock.
I think your technique may need a little refinement.
I think you've really got your work cut out for you today.
Well, if the Army could teach me how to box, I can teach Mork.
Well, Mork doesn't have the faintest idea how to defend himself, so I hope you can help.
Oh, I hope so, too.
Now, Mindy told me what happened down at The Eatery, and as long as you're going to go out with my daughter you might as well learn how to protect her.
Here, put those on.
I can't, these gloves are pregnant.
No, Mork, they're supposed to be that big.
Here let me help.
There.
Now, cut that out.
Don't Orkans have any method of defending themselves?
Oh, yes, but they're all non-violent.
Let's see, there's running away.
Running away?
And whimpering.
And for dangerous situations, we use compliments.
Compliments?
What do you mean?
Come at me.
Okay You have very lovely hair.
I mean, what's left of it.
Well, I'm afraid those methods won't work on Earth, so I'm going to have to show you what you're up against.
Okay, I always say, if you can't learn something from an alien culture, you might as well stay in your egg, because ow!
Now you know what pain is.
I knew what pain was but nobody ever told me it hurt.
But that's why you have to be ready to defend yourself.
Oh, but you see, on Ork we don't hit each other.
We have mental competitions called holitackers.
I can cream you in a holitacker.
Okay what do I have to do?
First of all, no farging before the smegba's.
Right.
Two feet inside the force field, and You're going to lose points for that.
I'm sorry, but you have to be ready at all times.
Now come on, you try to hit me.
Hit you?
Yeah, yeah, try to hit me.
I appreciate what you're trying to do, Pops, but I can't do anything that would cause other people pain.
But, Mork, if you don't learn to fight, then you're the one that's going to feel pain.
I'm-I'm sorry, it's against my beliefs.
Oh I'll get that.
Well, what are you going to do if you're attacked?
I don't know.
But I won't use violence.
Hello?
Yes, he's here.
Yeah, just a minute.
Mork, I think it's that guy from The Eatery; George.
: George.
Hello.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Well, if you insist.
Kay-o.
Be there or be square.
Bye-bye.
What happened?
What did he say?
Well, he said he was on his way over to pull my lungs out through my nose.
Look, Dad, tell Mork not to come home.
Well, he's been hiding out all day because he's afraid he's going to get beaten up.
Well, yeah, that George character is out in front of the house right now.
Okay, but just tell him what I said.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
: Mork!
How did you get past George out there?
I snuck in the back way.
This house doesn't have a back way.
It does now.
Mork, why are you doing all this?
Well, to save my pride.
You see, on Ork, one who throws a punch is much more foolish than one who receives it.
And if I got in a fight with George, I'd be humiliating myself.
On Earth, running around and hiding is considered humiliating.
That's crazy.
In Orkan philosophy, violence is considered a disgrace.
The highest form of courage is to avoid a fight cleverly.
I remember the Three Hundred Bleem War.
We hid from Andromeda.
Your planet hid from another planet?
Yes.
We went behind a comet, and they went right by.
Well, then what happened?
That was it.
That was one of our greatest victories.
Boy, did we laugh when they packed up and went away.
That's ridiculous.
Ridiculous?
Say that to Squellman the Yellow.
He was one of our greatest heroes.
He was surrounded by millions of Necrotrons, and he got away by saying the famous line, "Hey, behind you"!
That's crazy.
Oh, you're right.
Necrotrons don't even have behinds.
Ah, but enough of this gay banter.
I'm off to get the mail.
What if George sees you?
Oh, he won't see me.
He'll see Mork Astaire!
Ginger?
Ginger, is that you?
Well, I thought it was a very effective disguise.
I never realized it was you.
Morkalong Cassidy.
I think you should either stand up to George or leave town.
Ching ching ching ching ching.
I ain't gonna leave town.
A man's got to do what a man's got to do when a man's got to do it.
So, what do you got to do?
I got to hide.
How the west was won.
Now, just because his viewpoint isn't the same as ours is no reason that he's wrong.
And besides, what's so bad about not wanting to fight?
What do you think I should do?
Now, whatever you think is right, but I'm not sure that the best way is dressing up like a dead cowboy.
I can be a pirate, then.
Wrong eye.
Argh!
Shift the mizzenmast and swab up that poop.
You're right.
I should get out of town.
Here, go find a wig.
Well, I have had it.
Three days, and that George is still in front of the house.
He hasn't moved.
Oh, yes, he has.
He's right outside.
Oh, no.
Quick, quick, you can hide under there.
Hey, you're getting good at this, too.
I'm really going to get him this time.
He'll never even see me.
Where is he?
Well, you see, he saw you coming, and he was so scared that he left town.
I bet he did run away.
He's probably scared out of his wits, if he has any.
Look, Mork isn't afraid of you.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
And what if I don't?
Then tomorrow, you're going to blow this oboe out your ear!
Okay, I'm going but you tell that coward that I'll be waiting for him at The Eatery, and if he doesn't show up, I'll get him no matter where he hides.
So, what's for dinner?
Dad, Grandma, I'd like to speak with Mork alone for a minute.
Yes, I understand, dear.
That guy was lucky he didn't throw a punch at me.
Not half as lucky as you are.
Well, I knew somebody was lucky.
Mork, this is difficult for me to say.
Maybe you should hum it, then.
Now, look, throughout this whole thing, I've been trying not to tell you what you should do, but now George is starting to bother all of us, and it-it's starting to look like you're just afraid of him.
Now, I'm no coward.
I just believe that violence is humiliating.
That's all.
All right, I believe that's true, but the way you're acting, I can't help but think that You're ashamed of me, aren't you?
No.
Yes, you are.
And Mork from Ork has never been called a coward.
I've never even lost a holitacker, except for that one on Serius, and how can you trust an eight-legged Pekinese as an umpire?
Look, Mork, you don't have to prove anything to me.
Yes, I do, and I will.
I'm going down there, and I'm going to make that guy humiliate himself if he has to tear off all of my limbs to do it.
Where is he!
Ow Oh, hi.
So, you ready to fight?
Oh, no but I'm ready to let you make a fool out of yourself.
Just how are you going to do that?
By standing up to you.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm going to make my stand sitting down.
I can't fight you like that.
Lucky for you.
All right, you want to play cute?
: Okay.
Tide's up.
Mork.
: Leave him alone!
Mindy, don't interrupt.
George and I were just having a little discussion.
Good point.
Mork, he's humiliating you.
Oh, au contraire, ma petite.
I've got that sucker on the run right now.
Get up.
I feel real sorry for you.
Oh, come on now, George, don't go and mess up the place.
I'm not going to mess anything up except him.
Why don't you lay off the guy?
You can see he isn't going to fight.
Yeah.
Hey, what is it with you people?
You never gave me a hard time before.
And nobody ever stood up to you before.
Thanks, Lumpy.
Well, listen, I could care less about this idiot.
All I ever wanted to do was have a dance with Mindy here.
I don't think she wants to dance with you.
I think her exact words were, "That guy is a stupid creep".
I've had enough out of you, chump.
Now you've had it.
You can go ahead and do what you want to do, but I'm not going to fight.
: Look, Lumpy, the Supremes.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
He started it.
He started nothing.
He wasn't even going to fight.
Oh, big man.
I mean, what's next George?
You're going to go step on some baby chicks?
You see George?
I've got the support of the people.
I win.
Shut up all of you!
Now this whole thing started because I wanted to dance with Mindy here, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.
Cut it out!
I can't allow that, George.
Look, all right, I will dance with you.
Mork, why don't you just go home?
No.
You leave her alone.
Yeah?
You going to stop me?
Mm yes, I am.
Oh, no.
You've got very lovely teeth, George.
What?
!
Really, you probably floss, don't you?
You're crazy!
No, you're crazy if you don't floss.
I'm going to smash your face in right now.
I've got to warn you, you're going to humiliate yourself.
I'm awfully fast.
Yeah?
I've beaten guys who were fast.
Oh, not this fast.
I'm into time warps.
I don't care if you're into kung-fu.
Hey, where'd he go?
I'm over here, Clone Prince.
La, la, la, la, la Stereo.
La, la, la, la, la : Hello, you like me here, too?
La, la, la  This is too humiliating for you.
Please, make me stop.
What's going on here?
He's making a fool out of you.
Face it, George, he's too fast.
He's just playing with you.
Oh, yeah?
We'll see who's playing with who!
Whom.
Bon appetit Oh  Again?
Oh, this is too painful for me.
Please stop making me humiliate you.
Well okay.
Will you say you're sorry to Mindy?
I'm sorry, Mindy.
Boy, am I ever sorry.
Then it's over.
Bartender, spam for everybody!
Mork, that was the most incredible thing I've ever seen.
How did you do that?
I don't know I think I'm a little out of shape.
I think I pulled a frontal lobe.
It was absolutely amazing.
You I mean, you-you beat him without hurting him, and you protected me.
You deserve a big kiss for that one, boy.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in Orson.
What are you doing?
Oh, I was doing a little shadowboxing.
Since there are no shadows in my mind, I was punching thoughts.
I didn't know you had any.
Oh Just one, and the little sucker's hiding in my subconscious.
Whoa.
Why are you fighting?
You know violence is against Orkan law.
Oh, I know that, but I'm trying to fit in here on Earth, because these are a very violent, violent people.
You mean, they have wars?
Oh, no, worse than that.
Violence is part of their everyday lives.
First of all, they slash prices.
They drown their sorrows.
They punch buttons, and they kill time.
I'm not even going to tell you what they do to eggs.
I had no idea Earthlings were so vicious.
Oh, not only that.
They blow up photographs.
They hang plants.
And I heard one guy telling another guy, "Hey, man, you can crash at my place".
And even when they're finished having a fight and they want to make up, they threaten to bury the hatchet.
What makes them so violent?
I don't know.
I think it starts when a baby is born.
The first thing the doctor does is hit it.
They don't stand a chance, Your Immenseness.
This is Mork, signing off.
Until next week, nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Come in.
La cucaracha, la cucaracha.
Hi, honey.
Hello, darling.
No, not you, her.
Hi.
Oh.
What'cha doing?
I'm restringing a guitar.
How about you?
Oh Mindy and I are going nit-picking.
Uh, don't you mean "picnicking"?
Oh, now you're nit-picking.
Anyway, we thought we'd go up to Boulder Lake and have a picnic.
Ahh.
I've got ham sandwiches and hot chocolate in there.
Yeah, and I see Mork has the blanket and the, uh, pepper?
No, ants.
Mindy said no picnic is complete without them.
Those ants are revolting.
No, they're happy with their form of government.
You see, the little suckers are just dancing.
Anyway, we stopped by because we want you and Grandma to come with us.
I've got plenty of food.
And plenty of ants.
Well, honey, I'd love to go, but your grandmother isn't feeling too well.
Oh, what's wrong?
Well, you remember her friend Barney?
Oh, yeah, he's the one she plays gin rummy with.
Was.
He passed away Friday night, and Cora's taking it very hard.
Oh, that's terrible.
Yeah, especially since Barney was four years younger than Cora.
Mrs. Hudson, want to buy a guitar?
No strings attached.
No, thank you, Mork.
I'm just looking for my glasses.
Oh.
Oh.
Thank you.
Whoa, you're right.
I don't think I've ever seen her this depressed.
She's just not herself.
For three days now she hasn't even called me a wiener.
Why is Mrs. Hudson so sad?
Well, it's probably because she's lonely, Mork.
She just doesn't have too many friends her own age.
Oh, on my planet, the elders have all the friends they want.
Well, here it's a little bit different.
Lots of people, especially the young ones, ignore their elders.
But they're the ones with all the knowledge and experience.
On Ork, they're always being surrounded by young people.
Oh, we have the same thing in our big cities it's called mugging.
It's just not easy being old.
Oh.
Mrs. Hudson seems so lonely, I'd like to do something to help.
What does she want to do, and I'll do it with her?
Oh, that's really sweet, Mork, but see the problem is that she needs somebody her own age.
Look, why don't you two kids go have your picnic.
I'll restring Cora's guitar and maybe that'll make her feel better.
All right.
Well, listen, Dad, I'll call after we're done just to see how Grandma's doing.
Okay.
I'm sure that'll cheer her up.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye, Grandma.
Hey, they ran away.
Ants.
Ants.
Ants!
He said he didn't like them.
Look, he's dancing with them.
Well, I'm going to go in the back and see if I can cheer Grandma up.
If anybody comes in, uh, just yell.
You said, yell.
You okay, Mork?
Certainly, my main munchkin.
What's action, plasma?
Eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh, eeh.
Eeh, eeh.
Eugene, I Eugene, I want to ask you a question.
Sure.
That's one of the things I like about you.
Everyone else is always telling me stuff, you're the only one who asks me anything.
What's happening?
What do old people do for fun?
Well, my mother's pretty old, she's 31 and she likes watching soap operas on TV.
No, no, I mean a lot older, like Mrs. Hudson.
Oh, you mean over 40.
I don't think they have any fun.
Why?
I don't know, maybe it's a law.
What do they do then?
They hang out by the parks and the museums.
What makes those places so special?
They're free.
Ah.
What do they do at the park?
They feed the pigeons.
Hey, I got to go in for my lesson.
Thanks for the information, my man.
Any time.
What it was.
What it shall be.
One day.
Yeah.
Hey, good lookin'.
Oh, Mindy's not in.
Who's Mindy?
I'm talking to you, brown eyes.
Oh.
Oh, why, what can I do to help you?
Oh, you can walk up and down my back in a flimsy kimono.
Hubba-hubba-hubba-hubba!
Oh, why I don't even know your name.
And besides, my kimono's at the cleaners.
Oh, shazbot.
But maybe you can show me something in an Ethiopian lip whistle.
A harmonica.
: Oh, certainly.
Follow me.
Oh!
Whoa.
Must be jelly 'cause jam don't shake like that.
Oh, uh, what key would you like it in?
"Q".
Oh, we don't have it in the key of "Q".
Well, then, you pick one you like.
Uh, let's see, uh Uh, how about the key of "C"?
How about dinner?
Oh.
Well, uh,  no, I'm having Moo Goo spaghetti.
: Or whatever.
Well, you see, I'm pre-indisposed.
Oh, cara mia, you're beautiful when you're tongue-tied.
Do you, uh, do you know "Lady of Spain"?
Oh, is the Pope Polish?
Now that will be $5.29.
Oh.
$5.29.
Thank you.
Boy, I can remember when these things used to be  I forget.
Would you like to have that wrapped?
Oh, no thanks, I'll play it here.
Oh.
How about you and me blow this Popsicle stand?
Where are you going?
To the museum.
I've never been to the museum.
Oh, come along, sweet pea.
We can't keep those statues waiting.
This time of year the fig leaves begin to fall.
Oh, we'd make a peach of a pair, oh I know you cantaloupe, but oh, honeydew.
Oh, wait a minute.
Why, I don't even know your name.
Uh, hah, ah, that's a good question.
Um Hohner.
Bill C. Hohner.
Oh, how do you do, Mr. Hohner?
My friends just call me "Marine Man".
On the way to the museum, we'll stop by this wonderful delicatessen and pick up some munchettoes.
Oh, wonderful.
I'm starving.
Oh, not for us.
For the pigeons.
Ah, Mindy, our little girl is growing up.
Yes, soon she'll be leaving the nest.
Really, you two are impossible.
Oh, us?
You're the one that's been taking the long lunch hours.
Yes, and I'd hate for your granddaughter to find out how late you've been rolling in these past two nights.
Now, the museum closes at 9:00, and I've been home by 10:00, haven't I?
Yes, but the museum is only four blocks away.
I want to know what you've been doing between 9:00 and 10:00, hmm?
Well, we're not exactly spring chickens, you know.
We don't just skip along the sidewalk.
Why are you being so secretive about all this?
Well, I think a person should keep one's personal life personal.
Oh.
Who's the one that always wants to know every last detail when I go on a date, hmm?
Right.
Turnabout is fair play, so tell us everything.
Yeah.
Well, so far, we have gone to the museum.
And?
Uh-huh?
And to the park, to feed the pigeons.
And what else have you been doing?
Dad, she doesn't have to answer that question.
Oh, that's all right, dear, I'll answer him.
None of your business, Fredzo.
Isn't that nice, she's back to normal.
Even if she is hiding something.
Well, I think it's wonderful.
You know, Grandma, you've been like a new woman these last few days.
Really?
Oh, absolutely.
And Mindy and I are dying to meet the man who's responsible.
Well, it just so happens he's coming to take me to lunch.
Lunch?
Good grief, my chicken potpie.
You know, now I might not know what I'm talking about, but listen to your heart.
You know, sometimes when you listen to your head, logic gets in the way of things.
You're right you don't know what you're talking about.
I know I'm meddling, but I just want what's right for you and Bill.
Oh, everything's fine dear.
Only there's something about him.
Oh, I know, I know.
I feel the same way about John Travolta.
No.
No dear, what I mean is, there's something kind of, well, familiar about him.
Oh, that's probably Bill now.
I'll go get my coat.
Okay.
Oh, you must be Bill.
I'm Mindy, Cora's granddaughter.
Oh, charmed.
Oh.
Oh, Dad, this is Bill.
Take a hike.
Just kidding.
You know something?
You've made my mother-in-law very happy.
Oh, yes, she's like a kid again, and we really want to thank you for that.
Oh, since I've made you both so happy, and you don't mind what's happening between Cora and me, I want to share with you a little secret.
Nanu-nanu.
Where did you hear that?
On Ork, I'm known as Mork.
I'm ready, Bill.
Did-did you have a nice chat?
Oh, yeah.
And I hope that-that Bill and I get a chance to chat again.
Real soon.
Uh-oh.
Looks like I'm up the big creek without locomotion.
Hold it right there, Casanova.
Casanova?
I've heard of supernova, Chevy Nova, bossa nova  And you're not going to get out of this one by acting dumb.
But I wasn't acting.
Mrs. Hudson and I had a wonderful time today.
We started off by escorting a Boy Scout across the street.
We had to drag him away from his mother to do it.
Then we played chicken with kids on skate boards.
Finally, we inched our way up Main Street.
Backed up traffic all the way to Utah.
We were real scamps.
Mork, how could you do such a thing?
Oh, change my age?
With my Orkan age machine.
I set the controls for senile, subtract two.
I'm not talking about the mechanics of what you did.
I want to know why you did such a horrible thing to Grandma.
How could it be horrible when it makes her so happy?
She's only happy because she thinks that you are an old man.
But when I use my age machine, I am an old man.
You're being unfair to my grandmother.
How could it be unfair?
She was sad, I made her happy.
Therefore, how can you call it unfair?
What if she falls in love with you?
Now, you certainly aren't going to marry her, and that might break her heart.
Don't you see, you could be doing more harm than good?
Uh-oh.
Sudden realization.
Mork the Good is suddenly Mork the Bozo.
Better call a travel agent and book a heavy guilt trip.
How could I do such a dumb thing?
Oh, Mork, your intentions were good.
Yeah, but there's a saying on Ork.
"The road to Earth is paved with good intentions".
I'm a real nimnul.
To my face!
But how can I solve the problem, though?
Mrs. Hudson and I have a date tomorrow night.
I guess you're just going to have to break up.
I'm already pretty broken up right now.
No.
I mean, you're going to have to tell her that you're not going to see her anymore.
Oh boy, and is that going to be hard.
I think she really likes that old man.
Eugene I thought you'd never get here.
What's up, Mork?
I need to ask your advice again.
I'll do the best I can, but you got to understand, I have my limitations.
I'm only ten years old.
You're the only one I can ask.
What about Dear Abby?
She knows everything.
I've read her advice, and how can you trust a woman who begins her letters, "Dear Puzzled"?
Okay, lay it on me.
All right.
Let's say someone likes you very much, and you want to end the relationship?
How do you do it?
Tell them to take a hike.
Oh.
Effective, but cruel.
How do you do it if you don't want to hurt their feelings?
Mork, there must be 50 ways to leave your lover.
But I only need seven or eight.
Lay it on me, my main munchkin.
Well, one is, you slip out the back, Jack.
All right.
"Slip back, Jack".
Make a new plan, Stan.
Uh plan, Stan.
Just drop off the key, Lee.
Key Lee?
Oh, Chinese wisdom.
And get yourself free.
Munchkin, you are wise beyond your height.
Well, one thing you got to remember: Don't let those chicks railroad you into anything.
Yes.
Funny planet, where chickens run the railroad.
Boy, I certainly hope Mork can bring this off.
Oh, I know he can do it.
I just hope he doesn't break Grandma's heart.
Mmm, Bill isn't here yet.
No.
Well, you look very nice tonight, Cora.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, your hair looks so pretty.
Uh, I just washed it.
Oh, that must be Bill.
I-I'll get that.
Ah.
Oh, hello.
Guacamole, SeÃ±orita.
Uh, none for you until you pluck your hand.
Oh, hello, Bill.
Oh, sweet one.
You better make this good.
No pressure.
Um, well, I, uh, guess I'll go, uh, practice my trombone solo.
I'll help.
Yeah.
Here, Bill, come on, sit down.
Oh.
Oh, aren't those lovely!
Thank you.
Um Uh, Bill There's something I want to There's something I have to s  Psychic.
Yes, age before beauty.
No, no.
Pearls before swine.
Oh, go ahead.
Oh.
Kay-o.
Cora, there's something I have to say to you, and I'll try and make it as quick and painless as possible.
The-The painless is easy.
At my age, the quick is the hard part.
Mm.
Cora, after careful consideration, I've decided to slip out my back, Jackson.
Which is to say, I'm going to make a new plan, Chuck.
Which includes dropping off the key.
In summation, I'm going to get myself free.
What I'm trying to say, Cora, is, this is hello.
I-I haven't understood a word you just said.
I should have asked him for the other 46 ways.
Never mind.
Come and sit down, because it's my turn to talk.
Oh.
Now, first of all, I want to thank you for helping me through a very rough time.
Oh, rough time?
About Oh.
And the other thing I want to tell you is, I know who you are, Mork.
Shazbot!
How did you find me out?
Oh, come on.
If you were really old, the kay-o would have been followed by a pectate.
I'm-I'm a real nimnul then.
Oh no, you're not.
You're wonderful.
I really began to suspect that day we went to the museum.
Remember that piece of art work that you liked?
Oh, yes.
That lovely metallic sculpture.
Mm-hmm.
That was an air conditioner.
Oh.
And then last night when we were lost, you asked directions from a pine tree.
Oh.
He got us there, didn't he?
But only Mork could do those things.
Oh.
Well, I-I guess you don't like me anymore.
Oh, well, how can you say that?
Of course I like you.
Why, I-I like you more than ever.
Don't you realize you you snapped me out of a blue funk?
You've made me realize that I-I have a family that-that cares about me, and and a good job, and-and lots of friends of all ages.
I'll always be your friend, Mrs. Hudson.
Why don't you call me Grandma?
Kay-o, and hold the pectate.
But you know, there's one thing that still bothers me.
Last night when I tweaked your cheek, I did it to see if you were wearing makeup.
And you weren't.
It's as if you really have become an old man.
Temporarily, I am.
Oh, no, no.
There's no way on Earth you could do that.
You're beginning to get the idea.
Cora, there's something I have to tell you, and you better take this one sitting down.
Okay.
: Oh!
Cora, I have to tell you something 'cause I respect you, 'cause you're getting too close to hide it anymore.
I'm from another planet.
I'm an alien being.
Nanu.
Do you want to hear something weird?
Lay it on me.
I believe you.
: Aha!
Oh.
Why, I should have known when you when you carved our initials on that tree with-with your finger.
I can drink with the sucker, too!
Oh, what a relief.
You know, ever since you moved in with Mindy, I was seeing things that, well, made me think my mind was going.
But now, well, of course, it's so simple.
A man from outer space.
You accept it so easily.
Most people just look at me and say, "Bull"!
Oh, Mork, I've been around a long time.
I've seen the age of the automobile and radio and talking movies, and I've seen a man walk on the moon.
Me, too.
Well, if we can go there, there's no reason you can't come here.
Then I can return back to my normal age, and you'll still be my friend?
Oh, of course.
Let's shake.
But there's one other thing, Mork.
If you can make yourself old, could you make another person young?
No.
Shazbot!
Mork calling Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Ziz, bah, ziz, bah, ziz, bah  What are you doing?
Push-downs.
It's a common form of Earth exercise.
Here's another one.
We must, we must, we must build up the bust.
Why this sudden interest in exercise?
Well, I aged myself.
I'm still a little stiff.
You aged yourself?
That's a cheap way to get respect.
Oh, it's different here, Orson.
Here the young people get all the attention.
What do young people know?
They don't have the experience.
That doesn't make sense.
Oh.
I don't understand it myself.
Everything else here gets more valuable as it gets older wine, cheese, furniture, coins.
Everything except people.
Here they ignore their ancient ones, Orson.
They don't do anything nice for them?
Well, they do one nice thing.
They fix their income.
But why do they treat their elders like that?
Unlike us, as they get older, their bodies fall into a state of disrepair.
The first thing to go is their hearing.
What?
: The first thing to go is their hearing.
Why is that, Mork?
Well, I have a theory about that.
I feel it's because no one asks them anything.
Such a waste.
This is Mork, signing off until next week.
Nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Hi, Mork.
Be calm.
Okay.
Everything is going to be all right, but just start packing, okay?
!
What?
We've got to get out.
We're going to blow this burg.
It's over.
The party's over!
Boulder's had it.
What are you talking about?
There's a plague!
It's an epidemic.
It's called Christmas!
Oh the Christmas plague.
You know about it.
It affects the brain.
There're mindless hordes all out in the street milling around.
Last night, while you were at school, there was a roving gang terrorizing the neighborhood.
They were just singing for trouble.
Singing for trouble?
Yes, they wanted to beat up Monty Hall and his family.
They were going from house to house singing, "Deck the halls, deck the halls" Mork, those are Christmas carolers.
They're harmless.
Oh, a lot you know.
Quick!
We've got to get you out of here!
The whole town's under martial law.
There's a little fat dude in a red suit on every corner and he's called, he's called Santa Claus.
And he's stopping everybody!
And people are really sick 'cause they're putting plastic babies on everybody's lawn covered in straw.
I don't know, but we've got to get out of here before we're all infected!
Mork.
Mork.
Relax.
Now, this might be hard for you to understand, but it's all part of our Christmas holiday.
Oh, that explains it.
You see, the men in the red suits are collecting money for people that are less fortunate.
And the carolers are singing because that makes people happy.
Oh, yeah?
Tell that to the "Halls" after they're decked.
You see, this holiday is to celebrate the birth of one of Earth's greatest men called Jesus Christ.
Oh, is that the guy with the glasses that runs Boulder Stereo?
No, I don't think that's him.
You see, Jesus was a wise and wonderful man.
That's why this time of year brings out the best in people.
It's a time for caring and sharing, when you open up your heart to your fellow man.
Oh, I see.
For a few short weeks each year, humans try to act human.
Well, it's a start.
Well, it's a darn good one.
Orson will be pleased to hear about this.
I'll get it.
Mindy, you don't have to worry about snowing tonight, because here's your fair-weather friend, Susan.
Mork, Mork, Mork, Mork, Mork.
Oh, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.
You're such a dear child.
Well, Susan Taylor, whatever brings you into this neighborhood?
After all, there's no valet parking.
Mindy!
Oh!
Nonsense.
I'd go to a tacky area to see a friend.
Oh, that's nice.
I know.
So, what brings you by?
Oh, Christmas.
You know, at Christmas you stop to think about your friends, and that's why I'm here.
After all, you two are my best friends.
We're your only friends.
Oh, what beautiful Christmas cards.
Where did you buy them?
Oh, she didn't.
One man gave them all to her.
Aha.
The mailman.
Oh, that's the guy.
The one with the well-stuffed pouch.
Did you string up your Christmas cards?
Oh, sort of.
I hung up my Christmas card.
Oh, then I'll give you a card.
Here, are you into camels?
Oh, thank you, Mork, but it's just not the same.
Cute camel, though.
Oh, Mindy, your place is just so homey, not like mine.
I mean, mine is just so gosh-darned elegant.
It's just that it's not really the kind of place you'd like to spend Christmas in all alone.
Oh, loneliness.
Heavy sigh.
I know.
What about that guy you're dating uh, the lawyer?
Oh, Patrick.
Oh, well, no, we're not going to be able to spend Christmas together.
He has this silly quirk about spending the holidays with his wife.
That's easily fixed.
Just have him come over and bring the little woman along.
Mork, she doesn't know that I exist.
Oh, that's probably why she didn't send you a card.
But you have to let people know what you're doing.
Uh!
I have the solution.
Why don't you come over here for Christm Excuse me, Mork, I forgot I have to talk to you.
You were going to invite her to spend Christmas with us, weren't you?
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
I got the right idea.
I think fast.
I want to spend Christmas with you, Dad and Grandma.
So does she.
But I don't want to spend it with her.
Why?
You told me Christmas was a time of caring and sharing, a time when you open up your heart to your fellow man or strange woman.
What made you change your mind?
I didn't change my mind.
I just Oh, you don't understand.
I think I do understand.
You didn't mean what you said.
It was a nice idea, though, this But I guess this Christmas is just a sham.
No, I mean, it's still a nice idea, but she's just so .
And her ego is so inflated.
Oh, all right, ask her.
Oh, thank you, Mindy.
Susan, even though you're yech!
And inflated, would you like to spend Christmas over here?
Well, I suppose I could change my plans.
Swell.
Gee, I forgot.
I can't.
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, maybe next year.
Well, I'm a nooner.
I could never possibly get here in time for the festivities.
Oh Well, I'll wake you up.
Well, if it's that important to you, I suppose I could come over and spend Christmas Eve here, and then you could wake me up in time for the fun in the morning.
Okay, you win.
Thank you for thinking of us.
What are friends for?
Well, listen, I really do I do prefer to have the Christmas meal around 1:00.
Oh, fair warning: I only eat white meat.
Well, I guess we'll have to get a Caucasian turkey then.
Oh, we're going to have such fun.
Ciao.
Grub.
See, Mindy, aren't you glad we did the right thing?
In come.
Eugene!
What's action, faction?
Uh-uh-uh.
What's this?
A tree.
A tree in bondage?
Eugene, you're weird.
Why are you dragging this dead thing around?
Haven't you seen a Christmas tree before?
Oh, a Christmas tree.
No.
Man, sometimes you act like you're from another world.
It's a Christmas tree.
You decorate it.
Why?
Well, Mork, there are certain things you do on Christmas.
One, decorate the tree.
Two, eat turkey.
Three, exchange gifts.
Whoa, munchkin.
Run the gift part by me again.
Well, Mindy'll buy you something.
And probably her Dad and Grandma.
Oh, and ipso facto, I'm supposed to buy them something.
Now you got it.
Ooh, what a pleasant tradition.
SUSAN : Knock, knock Who's there?
Susan.
Susan who?
Susan Taylor.
What a terrible knock-knock joke.
Oh, Mork, I'm so full of the essence of Christmas.
I'd like you to meet my main munchkin, Eugene.
Oh, Mork, I am so thrilled.
Hello, there.
I am so thrilled that you and Mindy have invited me to spend this special time of the year with you that, well, I've decided to share with you one of my most cherished possessions.
A heavenly top piece for our tree my Gucci angel.
Well, any friend of yours is a friend of ours and your winged guest is welcome here.
Fly, little friend, be free!
Oh, heavy remorse.
I've killed your flighty friend.
I'm sorry.
It was your most prized possession.
That's all right.
I have six more at home.
Well, I must fly.
Oh, think of your friend.
Oh, that reminds me.
I'll drop off another angel with Mindy later.
Ciao.
Pekinese.
Boy, she's something else.
Yeah, I like her, too.
Eugene, would you come with me and help me pick out presents for the family?
Sure.
But I gotta tell you something.
That lady friend of yours has the wrong idea about Christmas.
She does?
Yeah.
Getting presents is nice, but giving presents is what the gig's all about.
Oh, like Mindy said, caring and sharing.
Right.
It's the time of the year when everyone's full of brotherly love.
Will you let go?
!
I saw it first!
I got more of it!
No, you haven't!
Hey, girlie, can you help me?
Come back here!
Come back here!
You had plenty yesterday.
Don't you have one with green?
Mork?
!
Mork?
!
Eugene!
You can't buy anything under there.
Come on out.
Oh, no way, Jose.
Nyet, nix.
I'm no chump.
These people are out for blood.
I'd rather go swimming in a blender.
Hey, Mork, here comes a salesman.
Can I help you?
You can help me.
What?
He's scared to come out.
Will you come out of there right now!
No!
Face it like a man!
Hey, everybody, there's a sale on the second floor.
That's right, 110% off.
I'm sorry.
I had to save myself, and besides I all I want is just a sweater.
It's all right.
They'll be back when they find out there's no second floor.
What kind of sweater do you want?
Well, I'd like to go big-time maybe.
Cardin, Yves St. Laurent.
I've got 12 bucks.
Oh, yeah, I've got to buy three presents with that or four, including Susan.
Twelve bucks, huh?
I've got an idea for you, friend.
Why don't you do your shopping at McDonald's?
All right, Eugene, we're off to the Golden Arches.
Mork, he was putting you on.
Oh, I guess 12 bucks doesn't buy very nice presents then.
Not for that many people.
Too bad.
At home we used to make presents for people Sure, you can do that.
I thought that's against the law.
You know, because on TV they say you've got to buy everything.
It's part of the commercialization of Christmas, you know.
The stores would rather you buy them.
There's no reason you can't make them.
Oh oh, yay, excitement, tingle.
I've got to get the material then.
Let's see, what do we need?
We need lots of gum ball of string some dust balls, a little tiny whip.
Mindy, guess what?
What?
I have a surprise for you.
I've hid your present all over the house.
You'll never be able Don't sit there!
Why did you hide your presents?
Why didn't you just put them under the tree?
I didn't want you to see them.
Didn't you wrap them?
You're supposed to wrap your presents?
Yes.
Okay.
You're nothing!
You're skuz!
You're not worth the money!
You're awful!
Who would buy you in a million years?
!
Doesn't sound very Christmasy to me.
Mork, look.
See a little paper, a little ribbon, nice little bow.
This is how we wrap presents.
Oh, that's a lot more in the spirit of things.
Yes.
Well, guess what I got for you.
Go on, take a guess.
Come on, just one guess.
No, I don't want to guess.
I don't want to ruin it.
Oh, party pooper.
Well, I'll guess what you got for me.
Come on, let me guess.
No.
Just give me a hint!
Give me a hint!
Give me a hint!
No, Mork.
You're just going to have to wait till tomorrow morning.
You know, you're just like a little kid.
Don't don't shake it.
You're going to break the What?
Oh cute.
Knock-knock.
Don't say, "Who's there"?
It's a set-up for a terrible joke.
Entre vous.
Hi, there.
Oh, look at all the beautiful presents.
How nice.
I only got one gift myself this year.
It's from my boyfriend, Patrick.
And his wife?
I doubt it.
You know what he gave me for Christmas?
A picture of himself.
And you opened it?
No, I don't have to, I know.
That's what I'm giving for Christmas this year.
That man doesn't have a single bit of imagination.
Oh, well, Susan, forget about Patrick.
We're going to see that you have a really nice Christmas this year.
Yes, we have presents even for you.
That's nice.
Look, I really appreciate your inviting me over here for the holidays.
I know I kind of wangled my invitation, but, uh well, I'm really glad you invited me, and I think we're going to have a really nice Christmas.
Oh, I know we are.
Since everyone's in the Christmas spirit, let's open those presents!
Now, I told you, we're going to open our presents tomorrow morning when Dad and Grandma get here.
Do you think you can wait that long?
Who me?
Yeah, you.
Remember me?
Mork the emotionless?
I'm in control.
Everything's cool.
Tell you what tomorrow morning when they get here, you just give me a buzz.
If the energy's right, I'll come down.
We'll have a cocktail.
We'll talk.
'Cause you know, Christmas is really for kids.
Well, it is getting late.
I think we probably should hit the sack.
Tomorrow's going to start pretty early.
Okay.
You know, in spite of what he just said, Mork certainly seems to be excited about Christmas.
Oh, he is.
It's like it's his first one.
You see, his, uh, parents, never celebrated Christmas.
Oh, that's sad.
Yeah, it is.
Mork and I have a lot in common.
Catchy tune.
Oh, look at this lovely brooch cameo from the antique shop.
Oh, isn't it lovely?
Oh, Fred, how did you know I wanted it?
Well, I overheard you mention it to Mindy.
Every day since July.
Oh, Mindy, thank you so much for the gloves.
They're really nice.
Oh, you're welcome.
Oh, and thank you for the lovely picture of yourself.
It's time for my presents now.
I saved the best for last.
Grandma may all your Christmases be bright.
Oh, thank you.
Pops, keep those chestnuts roasting.
Susan, this is even better than your picture.
And Mindy, for you.
And thanks for being such a swell roomy.
Oh, thanks, Mork.
Say, this is nice.
What is it?
Well, you said you've always wanted a rug try it on.
Just like Howard Cosell, and it's indoor/outdoor.
Um a-a painting?
Oh, yes.
You said you liked music and antiques, so I combined the two and I made a portrait of Liberace made out of old bubble gum.
I painted each wad myself.
Well, it's, um it's unusual.
Oh, I knew you'd like it.
Gee, I can't wait to see what I got.
Well, yours is the only one I bought, 'cause you said you wanted something returnable.
A saucer?
Surprised?
Oh, yes.
Uh, why a saucer?
Well, Mindy said you'd only appreciate something shallow.
Well, it it's a bracelet.
No, it's a lawnmower.
Of course, it's a bracelet.
Oh.
It's handmade by Mork.
Oh it's really interesting.
What kind of beads are these?
Oh, they're not beads, and I know you'll love it, because there's a whole collection up in the attic.
They're flies.
They can't fly now, silly, they're dead.
And look, I hand-painted each and every one of their eyes which was really a drag, took a long time and I made, I made little clothing for them.
Little pants, too.
Oh, look, look his human's open.
And if you look real close and you hold them up to the light, you can see I put sequins on the wings so they could look like Liza Minelli in Cabaret.
Isn't it incredible?
I knew you'd like it.
Oh It was just worth it just to see the surprised look on your face.
Well, I-I appreciate the fact that it took you so long to make that.
Um, could you put that in the box for me?
Oh, you know why I put it in such a big box?
Why?
So you couldn't guess what it was.
Did I fool you?
You sure did, boy.
I never would have guessed what was in there.
Well, did everyone like my swell gifts?
Oh, yes.
Well, if you liked those, wait till you see what I got for the entire house.
It's something everybody can use.
Oh, dopey me.
It must be upstairs.
I'll go get it.
Will you look at this?
Oh, my gosh.
I agree, but what can you say to the guy?
Oh, no.
What I thought was a picture from Patrick, it's a thousand dollar bill.
Oh, no, I didn't get him anything because I thought he gave me a crummy picture.
Oh, I've got to think of something that I can get for him and leave it in his mailbox.
I know.
I'll leave him one of my Gucci angels.
Oh, folks, now you got to admit it this is what Christmas is all about.
Not like those stupid presents Mork made for us.
Merry Christmas!
Well, what should we do?
I don't know.
Poor Mork.
I'm so embarrassed for him.
He worked so hard on the on all this stuff.
I know.
A rug, gum and dead flies.
It's tough to warm up to.
Oh, the poor boy.
Do we tell him?
I mean, we don't want him to make the same mistake next year.
Dad, how do we tell him?
Did you see the look on his face?
You don't have to.
I made a fool out of myself.
Mork I'm sorry I embarrassed you.
I'll be up in my room.
Wait a minute.
Okay, so your presents weren't very practical, but it doesn't matter.
Oh, Mork, Dad's right.
It's not the gift, it's the thought that counts.
That's true, Mork.
It is the thought.
Thoughts are important?
Well, of course.
I should have given you one of those for Christmas.
What?
A thought.
You can give a thought?
No, but you can give it to yourselves, I can make it happen.
Let me show you.
I don't believe it.
What was your thought?
Well, when I was a little girl, I used to have this dog named Peppy.
And I, I let him loose one afternoon at a picnic and-and he ran away.
A week went by and I thought that he'd gotten run over by a car.
And I just remember the way I felt the day that Peppy ran up the driveway.
Oh, thanks, Mork.
What about you, Grandma?
Well, I was just remembering my husband and our first Christmas together.
We, uh, we couldn't afford furniture or gifts for each other, but we bought a tree.
And it was the best Christmas ever.
What's wrong, Pops?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
You just made me remember the first time I held my newborn daughter.
My hands were so large and clumsy.
I just couldn't believe anything so tiny could make me so happy.
Thank you, Mork.
Me, too, Mork.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
I'd forgotten how much I loved that dog.
You like it better than flies?
Yes, even better than flies.
Whew.
I want to say something to you, too.
This is my first Christmas and you made it really wonderful.
Thank you.
Well
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot.
Welcome, friends, to the temple of suds.
If you're ready now, throw down your forks and come forward and have your soul cleansed in the Joy to come.
I've got some good news and some bad news.
First, the bad news.
This sucker's hot.
But now the good news.
Tonight we'll be having a jacuzzi.
Yea, yow Yea, yea.
: every single time.
Oh, man.
Mindy, why are you mad at your coat?
Because my watch stopped.
Ah, and you suspect your coat?
No.
My watch stopped and I got a ticket.
Oh, on Ork when our watch stopped we only get a warning and they take away Mickey's hands.
See, I was parked in this no-parking-after-6:00 zone with my jeep and I got back late because of this stupid watch.
I got a $15 ticket.
Oh, that doesn't sound fair.
It's not.
Then don't pay the ticket.
We're with ya.
Right on, mama.
I've got to, it's the law.
Who made that law?
I don't know, the town council or something.
Who said they could do it?
The people that voted them into office.
What people?
You know, the people of Boulder Dad, Grandma, me, you know.
Boy, that's stupid, you voted to give yourself a ticket.
Yeah, I guess indirectly I did, didn't I?
See, in a democracy, everybody votes and then the majority wins.
Oh, I vote we adopt Dolly Parton.
Do I win?
No, with two people, you can't have a winner.
Oh, sounds like democracy will never replace bobbing for French fries.
Look, Mork, I'm not an authority on these things.
If you have questions, you really should go out and ask other people and get other opinions.
May I ask you just one more question?
Sure.
Why didn't I win with one vote?
Well, that's because you need at least three people to vote.
That way you've always got somebody to break the tie.
What if someone votes twice?
No, in a democracy you can only vote once.
What a primitive system.
On Ork, we have a much more sophisticated way.
If somebody wants to be President, we just say, "Sure, go ahead, it's cool".
Grandma!
Pops!
Still no luck, eh?
No.
Mindy, I finished my observations of the migration of the North American wino, which was easy because he didn't move very far.
I can take you home now.
Oh, Mork, I can't.
Susan Taylor invited me by her shop.
She's gonna have a makeup demonstration.
And she wants me to be the model.
Oh, like the ones in Playboy.
: Hi, my name is Candy.
My hobbies are body surfing and neutron physics and I hope to one day know the entire Los Angeles Rams.
Not exactly.
She's only working from the chin up.
Oh.
Anyway, I'm gonna get a new face.
A new face.
Well, can I have your old one?
Listen, I'll see you at home later.
Ciao.
Bye, everybody.
One two We can play democracy.
Come on, everybody's doing it.
Do the vote!
We've got three of us.
We can vote on something.
But we have nothing to vote on.
Well, we can vote to adjourn then.
All in favor, say "ear".
That's "aye".
Oh.
Well, that's two.
That's a majority.
We win.
Let's pack it in.
I don't want to play.
Oh, come on, we'll let you vote first.
We have enough to break your majority.
: Republican.
Want to have some fun?
You can file these classical albums.
I'll be in back if you need me.
Well, let's see, albums would be under "A".
That was easy, but not fun.
No, no, no, no, no, no, you don't understand.
We don't fix cellos here, we sell 'em.
This is a music store.
: Da, you keep cello.
Look, I know where you can get it fixed.
What's wrong with it?
Nothing.
That's why I think you could handle job.
Well, look, if you change your mind, here's the address of the repair shop and good luck.
Oh, very much, thank you.
You're welcome.
Nanu-nanu.
Oh, you speak English!
You speak lousy.
Is because I'm not from here around.
I am from very far away.
I am alien.
Leapin' lizards, so am I!
Mork from Ork.
Nanu-nanu.
Sergei from Slavisgrad.
Slavisgrad.
Is that near Alpha Centuri?
No.
Ork, is that near Minsk?
No, you got me by the shorts there.
Unless that's the one with eight moons.
Well, where are you living now?
I do not yet find place to live.
That's why I leave cello here.
Sleeping in park is okay for me, but not for cello.
I know what it's like.
It was pretty hard for me when I blew into town, too.
Do you have to make reports of what you observe here?
Spy?
No, I am magician and student.
I play in the sympathy.
But I don't get first paycheck for couple weeks.
Oh, you're lucky.
I have to report back to this fat dude named Orson.
He's the one that made me come here.
Oh, no one make Sergei Krushnev come here.
I wanted to be part of this democracy, ja.
You know about democracy?
Oh, ya, I study this, mm-hmm.
Mindy and I are forming a democracy.
Leaping lizards.
No faking?
Yes.
And you could be a third so we can vote and I can ask you questions.
You can come and live with us.
Oh, I don't want trouble on you.
Oh, no trouble, no trouble.
Mindy'll be happy when she finds out about this.
Who is this Mindy?
Oh, she's the girl I live with.
Are you married?
No, but don't bother about it.
Neither is she.
Oh.
Well, what do you think?
Holy Moley.
Such beautiful apartment.
You must have big bucks, huh, Mork?
Bet you are American rock star, huh?
Hey, do you, do you have many pairs of Levis?
Ja?
Listen, do you, do you know the Beach Boys?
How 'bout Chuck Berry?
Hey  Long distance information Give me Memphis, Tennessee Hey!
Oh.
Who's your friend?
Mindy McConnell, meet Sergei Krushnev.
Mindy, Sergei, Mind, Serg, Mi, Se, Mm, Ss.
Nanu-nanu.
Oh, I see you've spent some time with Mork here.
Oh, yes, he show me so many things about your customs, you know?
Sergei, Sergei, lighten up.
So, what do you think?
How do you like my new face?
Oh, boy, what great country.
You don't like face, you get new one.
Ha.
Same face, new paint job.
Yeah, I knew it'd knock your socks off.
So, what do you do?
Oh, I am student and cello player, mm-hmm.
Oh.
Sergei's going to be part of our democracy.
Oh, that's great.
Listen, you're going to love living in this country.
No, I mean our democracy.
Sergei's gonna be our third, so we can vote.
He's gonna live with us.
Ja.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
I think we should vote on that.
I vote no, what do you think, Sergei?
I'm with you, Mork.
Two to one, you lose.
: I want to talk to you.
: We just voted on that.
: Now Oh, that's a different story.
Please to excuse me, where may I find laboratory please for me?
Oh.
You mean the restroom.
It's right through there.
Oh, a bed!
I never saw a restroom where you could really rest.
Boy, this America, really out of state.
What have you done?
I got us a third for democracy.
You just can't invite anyone to come live here.
I know that.
We'll vote on it.
Oh, no, we won't.
I pay the rent and I say he can't stay.
Oh, I see.
The one with the money controls the votes.
That's not it.
Mindy, you don't understand.
You see, Sergei's sleeping outside on a bench and he's got a violin with a gland condition.
Well, Mork, you can't just go and Mindy, I don't think our democracy's working too well.
Let's have a dictatorship instead, okay?
I'll be the tyrant and you'll be the peon.
Huh?
Huh?
Can I be the tyrant?
Huh?
Can I be the tyrant?
Come on, now.
Yeah, this is wonderful country.
In Russia, I have to sleep with 11 brothers, but tonight, three in one bed.
Is too much, I tell you.
What are you doing down here in your pajamas?
Well, I slept in the guest room so Sergei could have the penthouse.
Can I talk to you for a minute about Sergei?
You asked for it, you got it I'm listening.
Look, Mork.
Sergei seems like a nice guy, but you just you just can't go inviting your friends to live here.
Well, you told me to go out and ask people questions.
Not questions like, "Do you want to come home and live with me"?
Oh, I get it.
You feel left out.
Well, you can ask one of your friends home.
Then there'll be four of us.
But then it wouldn't work.
I guess democracy only works with odd numbers.
That's not the point.
He's a stranger.
But I was a stranger and you brought me home.
Yeah, you're even stranger now.
Anyway, that was a special case.
You really needed help.
Well, Sergei needs our help.
You're right.
Yes, he does.
And you can help him find an apartment.
Show him around Boulder.
Make him feel like he belongs.
Oh, be sort of an extraterrestrial welcome wagon.
Yeah.
I'll take some money out of my savings account and lend it to Sergei until he gets on his feet and then he can pay me back whenever he can.
Oh, you know something, Mindy?
You're a real wurble.
Thanks I think.
Anyway, if you have any problems, you can reach me at the store.
Okay?
Kay-o.
There won't be any problem.
We're like two fish out of water.
Yes, you are.
I'll see you later.
Come and get it 'fore I slop it to the hogs!
Rocky Mountain High Cincinnati Oh, is time for vittles, ha-ha.
Howdy, partner.
You like cowboy movies, too?
Oh, yes.
Where I come from we love all American movies.
Have seen Citizen Kane, When the Wind is Leaving, In Front of on the Water, uh, but, but my favorite is this Lonesome Ranger.
I would give anything to meet Mr. Ranger.
Ah, look, Kemo sabe, something strange, buckboard on its back.
Ay, Tonto, you're right.
with dental floss.
: Help me, Masked Man.
: Help me, Lone Ranger.
: Where'd you get that ugly Injun?
Why did they not gag that meshugena?
: Behind you!
Varmints.
Look!
: I don't have to show you no stinkin' varmints!
Well, that shows them, Tonto.
Onward.
: Who was that masked man?
He stole my teeth.
I need them for the bullets.
Hi-ho, Silver!
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa, Big Fella.
Whoa, Big Fella, there.
Sorry about that, Big Fella.
You should be TV star.
Oh, no, too much pressure and you have to get up too early.
Oh, everything going so wonderful for me.
I have new friend, place to live Uh, Sergei, I have to talk to you about that.
You see, Mindy says we only have room enough for two and we have to find you a place of your own.
My own?
You mean I can live alone if I want to?
Sure, why not?
Well, where I come from, no one lives alone.
Sharing a room with 60 people is solitary confinement.
Must be a long line for the shower.
Shower.
Oh, so many things to learn.
So many new experiences for me disco dancing, dirt bikes, uh, burritos, registering as an alien You have to register as an alien?
Oh, all aliens must do so by January.
I didn't know there were that many of us.
Oh, is thousands, maybe millions.
Whew, then it's no big deal being an alien.
Is big deal if you don't register.
It is the law, you must.
Wonder why Mindy didn't tell me that.
Is she alien?
No, Caucasian.
Well, then she wouldn't know.
It is big law, you must do this.
Do you think they'll kick me off the planet?
Oh, I don't know if they would go that far.
But they could arrest you.
I'm not supposed to get in trouble.
Orson'll be really T.O.'d.
I saw two men get picked up by the immigration authorities.
They were aliens without proper identification.
Where do I get proper identification?
Immigration Bureau.
Well, I better go to the : Immigration Bureau.
I'll leave Mindy a note.
Do you know where it is?
No, I haven't written it yet.
Are these people all aliens?
Well, they must be they're here.
Excuse me, are you from Romny Five?
Ah.
No second nose I guess not.
Next.
I'm here to register.
I'm an alien.
Fill this out and bring it back to me.
No sweat.
Nanu-nanu.
Sergei, psst.
It didn't even phase him when I told him I was an alien.
Oh, he sees hundreds of aliens every week.
Wait'll Orson hears about this.
Whoa, check this out.
The ten most popular people.
Real nimnulls.
Those are criminals!
Criminals, nimnulls, they don't look too swift to me.
Whoa, this pen's on a leash.
What's wrong?
Did you write a bad check?
Let's see, name: Mork.
Easy.
One down.
Place of residence: Ork.
Two down.
Education: P.S. one million six.
Graduation date: Betty Lou Zombax.
Residence: Mindy's house.
And, let's see, occupation: observing your primitive planet and reporting back its customs to Orson.
Oh!
Hey I can't answer this one.
What should I do?
Oh, take these to that nice clerk over there.
Kay-o.
Now what do you want?
Oh, he told me to take it to the nice clerk, but since she's busy, I'll talk to you.
If I can't answer this question, do I fail the exam?
This is an informational form.
Even you couldn't fail it.
Whew!
Well, which question is it?
That one.
"Have you had a recent vaccination"?
No, but I'd like to go to Miami Beach and stay at the Fontainebleau.
No.
Vaccination.
Like when they stick you with a needle.
Oh, I get the point.
Where did you come from?
Over there.
Okay, let's start from the beginning.
Where's your passport?
I give up, where?
Don't you have a passport?
No.
What's a passport?
Don't you have any identification?
Well, I have a mole right here.
How's that identification?
I don't think anyone else has one right here.
This is ridiculous.
I can show you the one on my right hip.
No, that won't be necessary!
Now now, let me get this straight.
You don't have a green card.
Right.
No passport.
Ditto.
No visa.
Right on.
No birth certificate?
Not even a note from home.
Legally you don't exist.
Oh, you exaggerate.
Therefore, I am.
Would you send the guard in here?
You know, there are penalties for being an illegal alien.
Hey, I resent that!
Even though my father was an eye dropper, he married Mom.
He had to.
Bob, I think we'd better hang on to this guy and ask him a few questions.
Hi, Mork.
Let's go home.
Miss, miss, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid we're going to have to detain your friend.
I got your note.
What is going on?
I have to register as an alien.
Oh, no You don't understand.
No, no, you don't understand.
I could be in big trouble.
I know.
Uh, now, what seems to be the problem here?
He's an alien; he doesn't have any identification.
We've got to ask him a few questions.
Well, he's not an alien.
Um, can I suggest a question?
Please.
Ask him where he's from.
Oh, from the planet Ork.
You see, it's in the photosphere of the galaxy Mellow Catorius, near the black hole Leon.
Oh I see.
And, uh, how did you get here?
Boat?
Plane?
Flying egg.
I see.
I always go by flying bacon myself.
Oh, the express The Sizzler.
Now tell him how you drink.
Oh, don't be a clone.
You know that.
Well With my finger.
Pfft!
Eeh!
Okay.
Guard, would you please escort this gentleman out to his, uh, flying egg?
Uh, would you put that desk back where it was?
No moisture.
Oh, this America is country on move.
: I tell you.
We're going.
Mindy, all these people are aliens.
I know.
Let's go.
Sergei, we're leaving!
Hello!
Hello.
Nanu-nanu.
I don't get it.
What?
Why did Sergei call himself an alien if he'd never even been to the moon?
We call people who come here from other countries "aliens".
Oh, that's strange.
Everyone on Ork calls himself an Orkan.
You humans subdivide yourself into different species Russians, Americans, Protestants, Jews, game show hosts.
We do.
I'm afraid that we haven't learned to live together very well yet.
Another thing I feel strange about is democracy.
Why?
Well, after Sergei got his apartment, he went out to get a driver's license, and because he was an alien, it took all day.
Oh, I think you're getting democracy mixed up with bureaucracy.
Oh, semantic confusion or rented lips.
You see, democracy is the "one man, one vote" system, and bureaucracy is the most difficult way to get anything done.
Why do you have such an inefficient system?
Well, we've been working hard at it.
Actually, we've been trying to streamline things, but that could take years.
Why?
Bureaucracy.
Hi!
Hey-hey!
What's happening, Mork?
Nanu-nanu.
Nanu-nanu.
You look awfully chipper.
Oh, yes, I am happy because of this great democracy.
Have place to live, have driver's license.
Didn't it take you all day to get it?
Oh, yes, that's what's so great about it.
Because where I come from, it would take six months.
Really?
Oh, yes, and if I failed, they make me date female Russian shot-putter.
Oh.
Well, Mork and I are really happy you're adjusting to everything so well.
Oh, very much thank you.
I must leave now, but before I go, I-I want you to have something from me.
This is some Russian caviar.
Oh, thanks, Sergei.
I'm really sorry you can't stay for dinner.
Oh, no, I have to go back and check out my new dynamite pad.
Dosvidanya, Tovarich.
Hello.
Bye.
I don't understand it.
Democracy didn't work with three people, it didn't work with two people, but it works for Sergei, and he lives all alone.
Well, that's one of the good things about democracy.
It protects the individual.
And speaking of protection, I think next time you have any questions, you should ask me first.
I know.
I'm a real nimnull.
You ask me to take a poll, and I brought home a Russian.
Whew!
That's caviar.
Fish eggs.
Oh.
Return to mother ship!
Yeah, back on home.
Roe, roe, roe, roe, roe, roe.
Oh, you like it?
: No way.
Mork, calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
: Mork calling Orson.
Come in, comrade.
Hey!
That accent.
It's Russian.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'll slow it down.
: Mork calling Orson.
Come in, comrade.
Heyyy!
Just the report, Mork.
Sorry, Your Rotundity.
What's happening inside your head?
Is your brain flaky?
Oh, no.
This is what earthlings call snow.
Uh, it's kind of like Martian lint bombs, only frozen.
Are they dangerous?
Oh, no.
If you try and light their fuse, they turn to water.
What else have you observed?
Well, earthlings have a custom called "voting".
It's so everyone can have a voice in democracy.
And they all vote?
No, only about half of them.
The rest have political laryngitis.
Maybe they just don't like their leaders.
I think that's part of the problem.
Too bad they don't have someone as well-rounded as you.
Is that another fat joke, Mork?
Oh, no, Your Obesity.
I mean, we're lucky enough that we have someone like you that we can all stand behind.
I mean, all of us, the entire planet.
That was a cheap shot, Mork.
Oh, rejection.
Heavy thigh.
: I mean, sigh.
See you next week, Your Acreage.
Nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Able to leap over tall buildings?
Hah!
Anybody can do that in zero gravity.
What's the big deal about that?
They call him Superman for that?
Oh, I'm perturbed.
I've got to write a letter about this.
Miss Smith, take some dictation.
: No way!
All right, I'll do it myself.
Dear Superman.
Ding.
I am writing you this letter because I'm really perturbed.
Ding.
How can you call yourself a man of steel if you wear blue tights with the underwear on the outside?
Ding.
Everyone knows that Krypton is the Miami Beach of the Universe.
Ding.
You're a jive turkey in red booties.
Ding.
Love, your friend, Mork from Ork.
Ding.
PS, Don't you sweat a lot, wearing two suits?
Ding.
Good morning.
Oh, God bless you.
Do you know where I can get a stamp?
Oh, sure, I think there's some over there in the drawer.
Ah, good.
Where are you sending a letter?
Metropolis.
Well, I have to go to work early this morning, 'cause Grandma's not feeling well.
Shazbot!
Whoa!
The mice must be taking steroids.
It's that Bickley creep again.
You mean that nice man that moved in downstairs?
Nice?
!
Haven't you met him yet?
No, I've been too busy reading these alien newsletters.
Well, that Bickley character has been making my life miserable.
While you're safe up in your attic, he's always pounding on his ceiling which happens to be attached to my floor.
Well, you know, Mindy, one man's ceiling is another man's floor.
That's some heavy apartment philosophy and you've got to remember that.
And the worst part is, I'm not even a noisy person.
I can't stand it.
Mindy, you earthlings must learn some more virtues, like being more tolerant.
We have a saying on Ork, "Tolerance is next to cowardice".
Don't Orkans ever have any problems with unreasonable neighbors?
Well, one time the planet next to us blew up, we all complained about it, and they never did it again.
Well, that's wonderful, but I don't think I can wait for his apartment to blow up.
I've been down there three times already and it hasn't done any good.
You just have to learn to adjust.
How can I adjust to constant pounding?
Oh, make it fun.
Watch this.
: I can tell by the way you hold your teeth You're an older man with a lot to bequeath Ah, ah I can tell by the way you take that pill You're about to sign your only will Ah, ah, ah, ah Barely alive, barely alive!
Mork, I don't have happy feet, I have angry ears and that guy is really bugging me.
Oh?
Well, you'll just have to be a little more acoustically understanding.
Understanding?
!
Well, why don't you go talk to him and see how understanding you feel.
Listen, I got to get to work.
I'll see you later, okay?
Ciao.
Bye.
No, thanks!
I'll sit this one out!
I give it about a 65, though!
It's got a good beat, but a little hard to dance to!
Quiet up there!
I'm not a ventriloquist.
I'm out here.
Oh, interruptions, interruptions Who are you?
Hello, I'm Mork.
Nanu-nanu.
No, no, no, no.
Get out of here.
Oh, what is it, what is it?
I'm still Mork.
I'm from upstairs.
Oh, you.
I've been wanting to talk to you, Bigfoot.
You and your noisy girlfriend have been driving me out of my mind.
What a coincidence.
She says the same thing about you.
Look, I'm trying to work down here.
It's tough enough without you guys tromping around up there.
I'd rather live under the Harlem Globetrotters.
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.
What are these?
Those are greeting cards.
I design and illustrate greeting cards.
What are greeting cards?
A gold mine, that's what they are.
Every simple-minded idiot whose mother has a birthday can't think what to blow his last sixty cents on.
Eh, thanks to me, he can now send a simple, stupid, sappy card, filled with phony sentiment.
Oh, that sounds fantastic!
Read me one.
Yeah, you probably would like this drivel.
"To my mother".
Ew.
"Your smile to me is like the dawn" Oh, gee "Whose coming hides the darkness "and lifts the sorrow from my aching heart.
"If only I could tell you, Mother, "what your life has meant to mine, "then I could die a happy man, although it means we part".
That's beautiful.
Garbage.
How can you say that about your own poetry?
Hey, it pays the bills.
I don't have to like it.
Oh, look.
Look at the pretty bunnies.
Yeah.
A hunter I know lets me draw his rabbits before he skins them.
Here's another one.
"What is a friend"?
Oh, brother "A person who is kind and just, "A person full of love and trust, "Who knows your faults but doesn't give a flying care Who, when you call, is always there".
Yeah, I know, I know.
"A person who will e'er be true "A person who is just like you".
Swill.
Oh, it's not only swell, it's fantastic.
Read me another one, please.
I don't want to talk to you.
Ah, but yet you are.
See how considerate you're being?
I'm not being considerate.
Oh, and you're modest too.
Oh, no, it's those kids again.
I can't get any work done.
Hey!
Hey, kid!
Yes, you!
Now that was a terrific throw.
Let's see you do it again.
Oh-ho!
Amazing!
Do you think you can throw it to me?
Ah Oh-ho!
Scuzzy little yard monkey!
I really ought to take these down to the orphanage and sell them.
You wonderful guy, you.
What are you talking about?
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to hide it underneath that crust, but I know, deep down inside, you're trying to save that young kid's life.
If he had taken this ball, he might have thrown it out in the street, then a truck would have come along and hit him, then he'd be in the hospital, and all of his little friends would have to send him get-well cards, and Oh, no, you're more than a wonderful guy, you're a saint!
You gave up your own business just to save that little kid's life.
Hey, kid!
Here's your ball!
My life has been miserable ever since he moved in.
Boy, that guy sounds like a real jerk.
Oh, he's worse than that.
I don't know how I can go on living there.
I'll bet he'd pound if I dropped a hint.
You know, your mother and I moved into this apartment once, and there was somebody next door who was pounding on the walls for two days straight.
Well, finally, I had enough of it and I went next door to tell him off.
Well, did you?
Nah, I couldn't.
It was a guy in traction and his nurse had died.
Oh, Dad!
That did make my day.
You want me to go over and talk to him?
No, I can do it.
It's just that I get so mad every time it happens.
Mm, well, you see, that's just it, Mindy.
Sometimes you have to learn how to handle these things without getting mad.
Mm, that's what Mork says.
In that case, maybe I'm wrong.
Hey, babe?
Yeah?
You the chick that sold me this album last week?
Well, we sell that album.
Do you have a receipt?
You didn't give me a receipt.
I always staple the receipt to the bag.
You didn't give me a bag, honey.
Well, what were you gonna do, listen to it on the way home?
I'll handle this.
Uh, what seems to be the problem?
This chick you got working for you is trying to rip me off.
I got no bag, I got no receipt, and I got a defective album.
What's wrong with it?
I don't like it.
Well, you can't return an album just because you don't like it.
Well, I wouldn't return it if I did like it.
You know, I don't like your attitude.
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy tolerance.
What seems to be the energy problem here?
I got a defective album.
It's, uh, it's scratched.
Well, let's try and deal with this in a holistic way.
Don't itch it and let it achieve its own energy and heal itself.
I don't like your attitude.
That's because you haven't got to know my essence yet.
Tell you what.
We'll get together, we'll have cocktails, and work out our karma together.
I don't want to have cocktails with your karma.
Well, we'll get together and have a natural breakfast, lunch or dinner.
You know, I feel an incredible vibration from you.
Let's share it.
Come on, now, don't be afraid.
There we go.
You're an Aries, right?
Yeah.
Fantastic!
I knew it!
I see an incredible potential in you.
You know, there's an amazing being in all the universe that can be and you know what?
I see a potential for you in show business.
I play guitar!
Fantastic!
Wow, psychic!
I knew it.
Have your service call my service, and be here now if not, get there later.
Ciao!
Well, I have to admit that was really impressive.
Well, you just have to use kindness, that's how I overcame Mr. Bickley.
You went down to see Bickley today?
Oh, yes.
We're the best of friends now.
Oh, come on!
Oh, yeah!
He said stop by again real soon.
By the way, when does hell freeze over?
Best of friends.
Oh, yes.
But Mindy, you have to be real considerate of him, he's getting a little old and you know, losing a little bit, because he must have asked me ten or 12 times if I wanted to take a hike.
Well, did you ever get around to talking about the noise problem?
No, no, mainly we just talked about you.
He must have been a repairman at some time or another, because he keeps wanting to fix your wagon.
I bet he would, too.
Well, he's not going to get the chance.
Oh, yes, he will.
I invited him over for dinner, tonight at 8:00.
And I feel the energy's right, so I'll catch you there.
The gestalt is now.
All right, let's see.
We'll bus you into this neighborhood.
We'll put up a tenement here.
That should shock 'em.
All right, we'll move Lester Maddox off the board.
Oh, good!
By the end of the game, we should have the whole place integrated.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Playing Supreme Court.
Well, not to change the subject, but I wish you would check with me before you go inviting anyone over here.
Oh, you mean like Mr. Bickley?
Yeah, Mr. Bickley.
And Susan Taylor, and that Russian guy, Sergei.
Well, Mindy, there's an old Orkan saying that applies to this.
You see, if someone pounds on your ceiling because they don't like the noise you're making, invite them over for dinner.
What a wonderful saying.
Look, Mork, I don't want Bickley in my apartment.
Oh, see, there's an incredible energy right there, because he doesn't want to be in your apartment, either.
And you talked him into it?
Well, it wasn't very hard.
I told him you'd fix him a nice dinner, then we'd all get together, we'd talk for Wait a minute!
I'll fix him dinner?
!
Wow, dÃ©jÃ  vu.
Uh-uh, you got that one wrong.
You invited him over, so you fix him dinner.
Oh, I get it.
I'll make my bed, so I've got to hang from it.
You got it.
But I don't even know how to cook.
I've never even met Julia Childs.
Well, Mork, there's an old saying on Earth: Fake it.
Oh.
Impending culinary doom.
So, what are we having for dinner tonight?
Check.
Ha-ha!
Check?
We haven't even eaten.
Just a little off the side top  Come in, Mr. Bickley!
How did you know it was me?
I'd know your pounding anywhere.
I brought you two a gift a bottle of bourbon.
Oh, how nice.
Well, thank you.
That's okay.
I always swipe a couple of these when I fly.
Oh, look, little munchkin bourbon.
I think I'd like a drink.
Oh, sure, what'll you have?
Bourbon.
Uh, this is all we have.
Well, you couldn't pickle a cricket in that.
Well, I'm sorry, but we have nothing stronger than wine in the house.
What about that 20-year-old scotch your father?
Mork!
Shh!
That's for a special occasion.
Forget it.
I hate Scotch.
It's disgusting and putrid.
Speaking of disgusting and putrid, my salad's burning.
His salad is burning?
Mork has a lot of exotic recipes.
Oh, you kids sit down.
We'll start off with the appetizers.
We'll begin with a little Maalox au gratin.
A little cheese for the three of us.
A little fromage Ã  trois.
Maalox You can sit over there Maalox?
Oh!
All I have here are three knives!
I have four.
I'm sorry, I forgot the soup forks.
Soup forks?
Bonjour, Madame et Monsieur.
Welcome to Chez Mork.
Tonight's specialty was going to be the chicken in butter sauce, but that slippery sucker got away.
Monsieur, would you like to see the wine list?
Yes.
LÃ -bas.
For you, smell the cap.
Ah, a very good week.
Monsieur, with this wine and a doorway, you'll have a fantastic weekend.
Now, Monsieur, for you, the specialty of the day.
There we are, lÃ -bas.
For you, here we are.
Okay  What's this supposed to be?
: Le peas frozen.
You said you're always asking for "peas and quiet".
But seriously, nice to have you here.
I'll be right back.
I'll tell the chef you're here.
Yo, Al, we got people here!
Start cooking, sucker!
These are delicious!
What?
They're not even cooked!
Well, at least this way they don't lose any of their vitamins.
I think maybe I will have some of that scotch.
Oh, okay.
That's a very good idea, Monsieur.
You won't spoil your appetite that way.
Now, for the secondary course for you  Le poomph!
What is what's this mess?
Oh, en franÃ§ais, le soupe, en anglais, soup.
Actually, it's a gestalt gumbo.
You see the little tiny live shrimp?
I couldn't bring myself to kill them once I looked in their eyes.
I'm sorry, Monsieur.
Things aren't going too well.
I'll get the busboy to clean up the excess.
But first, a little entertainment for you.
Carl Carl, quickly, come!
Feelings Nothing more than I'm sorry, Monsieur.
He's not worked since The Wizard of Oz.
We had to give him a chance.
Mm-mm!
It's like a soup and sandwich, all in one.
Oh, I get it.
You two are doing this so I'll leave.
Oh, no, no.
Mork is honestly trying to cook you a good dinner.
But  And now, Monsieur, for the spÃ©cialitÃ© de l'apartement le soufflÃ©!
Whoa, cool it!
It's ready now.
I need more scotch.
Mork, are you sure you followed the recipe?
Well, it called for beating eggs, and I couldn't bring myself to do that.
That settles it.
I can't take any more of this.
But you haven't taken any of it.
Let's just say I'm not hungry right now.
Oh, that's all right, we'll put it in a doggy bag.
But for you, a grouch pouch.
Mr. Bickley, this is the first time Mork has ever cooked.
Really?
I never would have guessed.
Look, Mork's dinner wasn't great, but at least he tried.
He shouldn't have.
You know, you should be more tolerant of people.
Now, we've had to put up with a lot from you lately.
Like what?
Like what?
!
Like your constant pounding and your rudeness.
You have been making my life miserable.
I just complain a little.
It's not that bad.
It's terrible!
Do you know that you're the worst neighbor I've ever had?
Isn't it wonderful?
You're the top of your field.
Really?
I'm that bad?
Well, let's just say if the Marquis de Sade were still alive, you'd come in a close second.
But, here's your consolation prize your snack sack.
If I'm so unlikable, why are you always nice to me?
Well, I believe the meaner a person is, the nicer you should be.
That's why I'm treating you like an emperor.
It's easy for you to be nice.
You've got each other.
I hear you laughing up here, and I'm down there all alone.
Well, if you treated people with a little kindness and respect, I'm sure you'd have lots of friends.
Be reasonable, Mindy.
Not lots; a few, maybe.
I don't mind not having friends.
I just wish I had someone to come home to.
You know, someone who needed me.
Someone who cared for me.
Someone Aw, I better say good night.
I'm beginning to sound like one of my own greeting cards.
There goes one sad earthling.
Boy, that's for sure.
What can we do to help?
I don't think there's anything we can do.
People just don't want to be around that man.
We can hire someone.
No.
It doesn't work like that, Mork.
There's an there's an old Earth saying that, "There's one thing money can't buy, it's love".
By the way, thanks for the dinner.
It stunk.
Oh interruptions, interruptions.
Who is it?
Mindy McConnell from upstairs.
Oh, what do you want?
Hi.
Can I come in?
That depends.
You intend talking to me?
Well, yeah In that case, no.
Mr. Bickley, are you are you embarrassed about last night?
Why should I be embarrassed?
You're the one who tried to poison me.
You know what I'm talking about.
The things that you said about being lonely.
You believe that junk?
I always talk that way after a couple of scotches.
As a matter of fact, I did believe it, and that's why I baked you this cake.
I want us to be friends.
There's icing on it.
Right.
I hate cake with icing.
Do you know why I hate winter in Colorado?
The Rockies look like they're covered with icing.
Mr. Bickley, how can you possibly stand here and?
Aw, probably some kids trying to sell me cookies with icing on them.
Hiya, Bickey.
That's Bickley!
Oh, that's my friendly nickname for you.
Oh, why me?
Mork, where have you been all morning?
Out to disprove an old Earth saying.
Look.
I sprung him from an animal jail.
He was in for assaulting a fire hydrant.
Oh, great.
Now I'll have to listen to howling and barking all the time.
Oh, no, you won't, because he sings and dances.
Watch this.
Camptown races, sing this song, doo-dah, doo-dah!
And he al and he also sings the blues.
Georgia, Georgia He's for you because I don't want you to be lonely anymore.
You mean why, that's that's the nicest thing anybody ever did for me.
: Buying me a stupid dog.
Oh, Mork!
That was a wonderful thing you did.
What did you mean about disproving an old Earth saying?
Well, that money can buy love.
Even if it's only puppy love.
I'll call him Bickey.
Sing, damn you.
Sing You can do it.
Camptown races, sing this song Pick up the beat.
Sing!
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Hey, Laser Breath.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
What are you doing, Mork?
Acting superhero-ish.
Funny, you don't look superhero-ish.
Let's hear your report.
Did you meet any interesting earthlings this week?
Well, this week, I met an earthling who makes greeting cards.
Those are what humans send to people who are sick.
Why don't they just send a doctor, like we do on Ork?
Oh, no, sir.
You see, doctors are worshipped here.
They don't come to see you.
You go to see them.
And they also live in luxury hotels called hospitals.
These hospitals are so overcrowded, the humans have devised a strange and unusual custom of gaining admittance.
Like what?
One's called "skiing".
They climb to the top of a huge mountain of sky flakes.
When they get there, they strap two pieces of wood to their feet, and then they slide down.
And if they're lucky, they hit a tree, and they gain admittance to a hospital.
That sounds like a lot of work.
Oh, that's nothing.
You should see how they gain admittance to a mortuary.
Well, see you next week.
Ten-four, huge buddy.
Nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Oh, I love a good wedding.
You know, it's always such a happy occasion.
Not for that poor sucker in the white dress.
You mean the bride?
I couldn't tell.
They had that net over her head.
What a really vicious tribal custom, you know?
I knew they had it in for her when she tried to make her getaway down the aisle, and they had that midget holding her back by the dress.
And I knew it was really over for her when that guy dragged her out front to meet that vicious mob.
What vicious mob?
Well, the one that was pelting her with little white pebbles.
No wonder married women get so many headaches.
Mork, those people weren't throwing little white pebbles.
They were throwing rice, and it's what earthlings do to wish the newly married couple good luck.
It wasn't good luck for those people whose feet they stole and tied to the back of that car.
Those were old shoes, and they symbolize the hope for prosperity.
Just like the cans that are tied on the back.
They tie their cans back there, too?
Well, it's kind of late for somebody to drop by.
Will you see who it is?
Who is it?
Eugene.
It's Eugene.
You know, you really amaze me.
And myself, too.
Eugene, what are you doing here so late?
I'm running away from home.
Your home's chasing you?
It must be a mobile home.
Well, why are you running away?
Because of my mother.
She acts like she owns me.
I'll give you some money.
You can make a down payment and buy yourself back.
Mothers don't care about money.
All they care about is power.
: Hang up your clothes.
Eat your vegetables.
Brush your teeth.
Take a bath.
I always thought mothers were nice people, too.
Not mine.
Anyway, I just wanted to say good-bye.
I'm gonna miss you, my main munchkin.
There's some tears gonna well up in my eyes.
I feel a severe moisture right now.
Eugene, do you really think that running away is the answer?
I just can't stand anymore.
Tonight she yelled at me for spitting out my liver.
Spitting out your liver that could kill you!
Eugene, those organs were put there for a purpose.
It was calves' liver.
Oh.
Dopey me.
Then there's the milk hassle.
She makes me finish every last drop.
Well, that's because milk is good for you.
Ah, but it's still hard to drink once you know where it comes from.
Eugene, in a couple of days, you're gonna look back on this whole thing, and you're gonna laugh about it.
No way.
This has been building up since I was three.
Maybe longer.
I can't remember before that.
She didn't even like my Mother's Day present, and I saved a long time to buy that snake.
I didn't realize children were so persecuted.
Well, so long, Mork.
What it was, Plasma.
Mindy.
Eugene, I hate to tell you, but as bad as you think you have it at home, you're no worse off than any other kids your age.
Now look, I happen to know your mother, and I know that she's a nice, sweet and fair person.
So, she got to you, didn't she?
Look, and your parents are probably worried to death by now, so I'm gonna take you home for your own good.
Why doesn't anyone take me to Disneyland for my own good?
Come on.
No, no.
You're not gonna take him back to that tyrant!
I grant him parental asylum.
: Hell, no, we won't go!
Hell, no, we won't go!
Hell, no Come on.
Come on, you guys, what is the worst thing could happen?
She could strap me to my chair and make me eat broccoli.
Broccoli!
Aah!
Broccoli's despised throughout the universe.
When was the last time you ate broccoli?
Well, when I was three bleams old.
And I still haven't swallowed it.
So, Eugene's parents weren't upset?
Not at all.
They had a feeling that he was with us.
He left a note saying to forward his allowance to my house.
Oh.
Kids do some crazy things sometimes.
Ah, yeah, well, that hardly comes as a shock to the father of an ex-four-year-old who once tried to defect.
I?
No.
Oh, yes, yes.
You got very mad at me one day when I hollered at you for drying the dishes with the cat.
Then you went up to your room, and you got your pillow and your teddy bear and your pinecone collection.
You announced you were running away from home.
Where did I go?
Uh, nowhere.
There were no volunteers when you asked who was gonna drive you.
Mindy.
Hi.
Carbonation.
Carbonation?
Well, you told me never to call you Pops again.
Mork, you're a gas.
Hello.
So, what have you been doing this morning?
Well, I was making observations of your primitive planet.
You know, I'm really impressed with how your police deal with tension here by throwing parties for their citizens.
I saw this one policeman who had stopped a guy and was teaching him how to dance by touching his nose and going, "Come on, now, can you do it"?
When he did that, well, they gave him a present and gave him a chance to blow up a balloon, then he gave him a massage and gave him a free ride in his car.
I was so impressed, I jumped out of the crowd that was watching and said, "Police hospitality!
Police hospitality"!
Well, that's it for today, dear.
For a first lesson, you did very well, Holly.
Before long, you and the piano will be the best of friends.
I'm not ready for that kind of relationship, Mrs. Hudson.
Oh.
Well, I'll go in back and pick out some practice books for you if you'll wait here.
I'm young.
I have time.
Hello.
I'm Donny Osmond.
All right, I'll tell the truth.
My name is Mork.
Nanu-nanu.
Are you a stranger?
Well, depends on where I am, actually.
Then I'm not supposed to talk to you.
It's for my own good.
Holly, I think you can talk to Mork.
He's a good friend of Mrs. Hudson's and mine.
He's okay.
So, what brings you here, little cherub?
Well, my mother said I should take piano lessons because I'd be glad to know how to play when I was 20.
So, how'd your lesson go?
I'd better not die when I'm 19.
Hostility rating: 104.9.
Are you angry at your mother, too?
Let's just say, she owes me.
Come along, Holly, dear, and I'll show you what I want you to practice.
What a cute little girl.
Oh, she's lucky.
I never got to practice piano when I was a kid.
They could never fit it in the test tube.
Oh Eugene!
What's action, fraction?
Let it slide, Clyde.
Get down, now, get back up again.
Oh, I guess you're not buying that honky jive today, eh?
What's wrong?
Trouble at home?
You still have broccoli written all over your face.
You know, my cousin's really lucky.
He's married and doesn't have to get washed every night.
Boy, marriage is the only way to go.
Hey, who's that?
Well, that's Holly.
Her mother's down on her, too.
Sure is a doll.
An android, maybe, but not a doll.
No, that's not what I meant.
A cute chick, a fox, you know?
Oh!
Real hot stuff!
Oh, a fox.
Okay, Eugene, it's time for your lesson.
Why are you doing that?
Oh, Eugene said you're hot stuff.
Actually, you're only 98.4.
Mork!
Did you really say that?
Uh, not to the best of my recollection.
Oh, come on, plasma, you're stonewalling now.
Actually, he said that.
He called you more than that.
He said you were a fox, a doll and cute poultry.
You're weird!
Whoa.
The Princess almost decked you.
Why did she do that?
I think she likes me.
Oh, you'd better be careful she doesn't like you too much.
You'll be carrying your teeth around in a bag.
Mindy, you can do it!
Fly!
It's all right!
I know you can!
Newton was wrong.
Do it like Tinkerbell does Go for it, girl, go for it!
What are you what are you doing?
I was just trying to help you lift off.
What you have to really do is shave your head to reduce the friction.
Come on!
Let's try it again.
There we go!
Put me down!
Oh, there's no place like home.
Mork, I wasn't trying to fly.
I'm late for a luncheon, and I've got to meet Sally, and I'm trying to dry my nails.
Oh, that's easy.
Here, let me show you.
Just have to wipe them off like this.
This wipes this stuff right off there.
Whoa.
Here we go.
Whoa.
Thanks.
Well, what are friends for?
Whoa.
You know, Mindy, you've got to wash your hands a little bit more often.
Mindy, there's one thing I don't understand.
Boy, you could've fooled me.
Well, Eugene told me he liked Holly, but he didn't tell her.
Well, you see, Mork, some people are shy.
They might like someone, but oftentimes they can't express their feelings because they're afraid the other person might not like them.
Oh.
Then why did Eugene think Holly liked him when she punched him and told him he was weird?
Oh, well, boys and girls often punch or push or hit each other as a way of getting close.
Punching and hitting and calling someone names means you like them?
Yeah, it can.
Then the Rams and the Cowboys are lovers?
I'll get that.
Might be Avon.
Oh, hi.
Mork, I got to talk to you.
What's wrong, Jackson?
Can we be alone?
That's impossible.
There're two of us.
I just don't want M-I-D-N-Y to hear.
Well, listen, good old Midny can take a hint.
Uh, if your conversation's so private, why don't you have it up in the attic?
That's really appreciative of you.
Have a good night, Bird Legs.
Bird Legs?
I'm really into affection.
See you later, burro breath.
So, this is your pad?
No, no, this is my room.
This is my pad over here.
Look at this.
It's really amazing, too.
If you move it real fast, it looks like blank pages.
I don't know how you keep it so neat.
Well, tidiness is my life.
Well, I'm ready.
What is your question you want to ask me?
I'm waiting with a worm on my tongue.
What?
Baited breath.
Oh.
Mork, I think Holly and I are in love.
Oh, this sounds serious, plasma.
We'd better sit down and analyze this.
Beep.
So, what are the early warning signals?
Well, she called me piano mouth Piano mouth.
Bozo brain Bozo brain.
And something I have only seen once on the bathroom wall.
Sounds like the real thing.
We have so much in common.
We both can't stand milk, liver, baths, broccoli and mothers.
Her mom made her get rid of her pet goldfish.
Oh, sounds serious.
Did she take it back to the store?
They wouldn't take it.
It's been dead for a week.
Oh.
That's really a pity, because they're easier to train that way.
Only if Holly and I could run away together, our problems would be solved.
Well, you tried that once before, and it didn't work.
I didn't go far enough.
This time, I'd go on a ship, so the captain would marry us.
And then our parents couldn't bug us anymore.
A captain of a ship can marry people?
I saw it in a movie once.
I see.
I came here in a ship.
I was the only person on that ship.
Ipso facto, then I'm a captain.
Hey, that's great!
Would you marry Holly and me?
Sure, no big deal!
Come up here tomorrow afternoon after school, and it's yours.
Right on!
Sam, blam, Sam, blam!
By the way, you'd better not tell anyone we're getting married.
Eugene, are you sure you're doing the right thing?
I thought people here only get married when they want to have children.
We don't need them, we are children.
Makes sense, my man!
Ha, ha.
Boy, am I a dummy!
Good-bye.
: Hello.
Hi.
What have you been doing all morning?
Well, I was down at the library.
Eugene said that was the place to go if you want to learn everything you want to know about weddings, and I was there all morning and no one got married, so I came back.
: Oh.
Why the sudden interest in weddings?
Well, who knows?
Maybe I'm the marrying kind.
Irrepressible delight at ambiguous response.
Did I hear you say that you would like to get married?
Oh, no, I was just whacking around the bush.
What I'd really like to know is more about weddings.
Can you help me?
Shoot.
You don't need to swear.
Maybe I'll ask somebody else if you're really bummed out.
No, no, no, I mean, what would you like to know?
Well, first of all, the female who wears the net over her head, why does she wear white?
Well, the bride wears white to symbolize her innocence and purity.
Innocence and purity.
Yes, and that explains why the groom wears black.
Well, at the wedding I was at, there was a woman who sat in the front row and went, : "My baby!
My baby!
I'm losing my baby!
She's leaving me"!
: Does she have an important job?
Yes.
That, uh, that's the bride's mother.
Oh.
The bride's mother has a very important job, Mork.
She and her husband pay for the whole wedding.
Oh, no wonder she was crying.
No, actually, she helps out a lot before the wedding, too.
She helps the bride pick out her bride's dress and get a blood test and, and sometimes even pick out the license.
Mmm.
About the only thing the mother doesn't do is give the bride a shower.
The bride's friends do that.
Oh.
Let me see.
You've given me a lot of information here.
Let's see, first of all, they take a wedding test, then take license with each other, and finally they jump in the shower with the bride and hose her down.
Oh, go find Telly Savalas.
What are you doing?
Oh, I was just about to tease my hair.
Nyah-nyah, nyah-nyah Nyah-nyah-nyah nyah-nyah-nyah.
Mork Mork, I just don't know if I'm ready to get married.
Oh, you can't go back now, plasma.
Remember the calves' liver, the broccoli, the dead goldfish.
Now, we've got to sit down and have a man- to-munchkin talk.
Do you think there's a race problem?
Oh, no, you can outrun her easy.
Well, here are your wedding duds.
Thanks, but you didn't have to do that.
Hey, I'm a generous kind of guy.
Oh, here's your bride-to-be.
You go get changed in the guest room, and I'll let you I'll let you know when the time's right.
Inside here.
Bam, bam, bam, blam, uh-uh.
I'm coming!
Ha-ha, Princess of the Munchkins!
Are you ready to be joined in holy headlock?
Anything's better than practicing piano.
Mindy said first of all, you need to pass a blood test.
Well I got a tooth pulled last week, and there was some blood.
Oh, you pass; let's go.
All right, here's your wedding kit.
Inside is one genuine wedding gown designed by Mr. Mork of Boulder, Colorado.
And also, what wedding is complete without a license?
All right, Eugene is changing in the guest room.
Now, you go change in Mindy's room, and when you hear the music, come on up.
Okay.
By the way, have you had a shower today?
No, but the dog licked my face.
Close enough.
You may begin, Carl.
Thank you, Otto.
Hold it!
You ran out of carpet.
Hey, I like your suit.
Well, it's my captain's uniform.
Let's get it in gear.
I have to study for a test.
Oh.
I realize you're a little nervous, but let's all try and stay calm and collected like myself.
Sorry.
Do you take this three-headed slimy thing to be your Sorry, wrong galaxy.
Here we go.
You may now join tentacles.
Oop, that's Ursa Minor.
Here we go.
Oh, that's Pluto.
Sorry.
You kids will be able to honeymoon anywhere in the universe after this.
Here it is here's Earth.
Buga, bugala mala may!
Bugala mala bay Wrong continent.
: Oh, my baby, my baby!
: I heard they had to get married.
Mork, I'm not knocking your ceremony, but we wrote our own vows, and we'd like you to read them.
As written.
Oh.
Oh, that's nice.
Do you, Eugene, take Holly to be the princess of your dreams and not make her take baths, piano lessons, or eat everything on her plate before getting dessert?
I do.
Do you, Holly, take Eugene to be your main man and principal squeeze and to allow him to wipe his mouth on his sleeve, eat lots of cookies and candy and pick the celery out of his tuna salad, and learn about life by watching Three's Company?
I do if he does.
He did, the energy's right, the time is here and the gestalt is now.
The ring, please.
I forgot it!
That's all right; I'll pop for the ring.
Here you go.
Oh, the can's mine.
I now pronounce you man and wife by the power invested in me by the egg in which I came.
But first, step on the can.
Matzoh bread!
You may now kiss the bride.
Kiss?
!
Yuck!
No way.
No way.
Guess I'll have to take some wedding pictures instead.
Watch the flookie!
You're now man and wife, yay-ay-ay!
Yay-ay-ay!
Mindy.
Hi.
Oh, heavy vibes; what's wrong?
Mork, Eugene and Holly didn't show up for their music lessons today, and nobody knows where they are.
What are you doing in your space suit?
Oh, it's my captain's uniform.
And you don't have to worry about the kids because they're having the best afternoon of their lives.
I married them this afternoon.
You what?
!
You don't have to worry.
It's legal because I'm a captain of a ship.
I don't believe what I'm hearing.
I didn't believe what I was hearing when they told me about the persecution from their mothers.
That's why I did it to set them free so they can build a new world where everything will be funny.
Mork, where are they now?
Well, they're upstairs.
But don't disturb them 'cause they're having the most wonderful time of their lives.
They're doing everything they couldn't do before.
They're talking with their mouths full, staying up late and eating all the little junk food that their little married hearts can hold.
Mork, you shouldn't have done that.
Why not?
Well, first of all, they're not old enough to be married.
It's illegal.
You have to be a certain age to get married?
Of course.
Shazbot!
That was the one question I never asked.
I bet not many ten-year- olds voted for that law.
That's what we've got to fight for now because these kids are being persecuted.
They're not being persecuted.
But they told me it was I don't care what they told you.
They're not being persecuted.
They're being taught, Mork.
They're being taught things like don't play with matches, and, and eat only foods that are good for you.
Things that are going to help them grow up.
Oh, I see things like don't sit on a sprinkler or don't kiss a moody rhinoceros on the lips.
Yeah, sort of.
See, Mork, kids don't always know what's good for them.
Oh, my stomach.
I must have eaten too much candy.
I must have No offense, Holly, but marriage makes me sick.
Hey, you guys, why don't you go down and wait for me in the Jeep and I'll take you home, okay?
I'll see you in a minute.
Okay.
I'll see you later, Mork.
Thanks for everything.
See, Mork, their own parents never would have let that happen.
Oh, I see.
Parents teach children lots of valuable lessons, like never pet a porcupine.
Never put out a campfire with your face.
Never sit down with a pocket full of caterpillars.
Ay.
Um Never go skinny-dipping in a pool full of piranhas.
Oh, never get out of a closed window.
: Never spit into a tornado!
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in Orson.
What is your report about this week, Mork?
Oh, it's about a wonderful Earth custom called marriage.
Marriage what's that?
Well, it a ceremony a man and a woman go through when they love each other very much and they want to have children.
Why do they want to have children?
Well, so they can make them do all sorts of things that children will hate.
So they can grow up to be better people or even adults.
Don't the children resent that?
Well, some of the children feel they're being treated unfairly, and I've even heard some say they hate their mothers.
And one, named Lizzie Borden, took it a little too far.
Earth mothers must be really mean.
As an Orkan, Your Immenseness, I have my own opinion.
I'd like to share it with you briefly for a moment.
The only thing worse than a mother is not having one at all.
Oh, Mork, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
Lay it on me, Your Circumference.
Remember that broccoli you ate when you were three bleems old?
Did you ever swallow it?
Oh, yes, sire, it's all gone now.
Good.
Good night, Mork.
Good night, Your Eclipse.
Na Nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Nanu-nanu, Shazbot!
"1884.
"In the years following the completion of Huckleberry Finn, "which was written in 1884, Twain went on to write his most scathing criticisms".
Hi there.
Hi.
Give you a lotta work in college, don't they?
Yeah.
Time and Professor Raymond wait for no man.
What are you doing still up?
Oh, me no reason.
Just thought I'd come down here and hang loose for a while.
You won't even know I'm here.
Mork Hmm?
I know you're here.
Oh, please don't make me leave.
I'll do anything.
I'll shovel the dishes I'll wash the snow but don't make me go back upstairs to him!
Please.
Him?
Him who?
Vincent Price.
He's upstairs in the TV in the attic.
Mork, why don't you turn him off?
I did and then it became real dark.
Don't tell me you're afraid of a TV show.
Hey!
What do ya think, I just got off the egg yesterday?
Vincent Price doesn't scare me.
It was the ghosts.
And the swamp and that dude with his head cut off, carrying it in his hands.
And the whooo!
That's what got to me, boy.
But Mork, that movie's on everybody's TV.
Boy, we need a lot more blankets then.
Mindy, why didn't you tell me about ghosts?
Well, I didn't tell you about ghosts because there is no such thing as ghosts.
And Vincent Price is a nice man.
He doesn't live in a swamp.
He makes soufflÃ©s and sells art at Sears.
And there's no such thing as ghosts, too.
Do you believe me?
All right.
I'm glad you got that off your chest.
If there's anything else you'd like to chat about, I'm here anytime you need me.
Why don't we chat about you going upstairs while I finish my report?
All right, if the subject's upsetting to you, we can always change it.
How about those basketball players?
Those suckers sure are big, aren't they?
Look, Mork, after tomorrow, we can spend a lot of time together.
I know, we'll go away somewhere.
We'll chat about anything you want, but right now I've gotta finish this.
All right.
Thanks.
A mind's a terrible thing to waste.
You're right.
Right.
We'll get you that vacation.
Vincent Price he's real old, you know.
Good night.
Ghosts Whooo!
Who could be scared of that?
Whoo!
Ciao.
Night.
Everything's just   Somebody here call a cab?
Oh, yes.
Uh, ma'am, your cab's here.
That's awfully kind of you, soldier.
Here's a quarter.
Next time you're at the U.S.O., you have 2Â½ dances on me.
You know, your army's doing a fantastic job.
Since I've been here, I haven't seen one Necroton.
Come on.
Listen, Mindy isn't here now.
I know.
She slept in.
She stayed up till 5:00 last night to finish that report for school.
Oh, well, I'm glad she finally did it.
She's been working hard on that for a long time.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
I think she needs to get away for a couple of days, rest.
Well, do you have any place in mind?
Yes, I'd like to take her to the Dog Star, Sirius.
It's incredible to see a whole galaxy fetch.
I still think it might be hard to fit that into a couple of days.
I don't believe it Ooh.
Well, I've seen it all.
What?
If I should go belly up tomorrow, you can put "She saw it all" on my tombstone.
What are you talking about?
Well, I've met a man from outer space.
That's nothing compared to that student out in back.
This bozo looks so weird, he makes Mork look like a Republican.
Oh, my kind of guy.
Do you think I should observe him?
Somebody should keep him under observation.
Step aside, don't push!
We can't all get through the door at the same time.
Exidor!
Mork, is that you?
I'm over here.
Would you step aside?
I can't see.
Ah there you are.
Mork, my old friend, you've grown.
Oh, I can't take any more of this.
What time is it?
Uh, it's 9:30.
Good.
Time for lunch.
See you later.
Lovely woman, but strange.
Exidor, you remember Pops?
Are you Chinese?
Uh no.
Oh, I was in the mood for a fortune cookie.
Oh, well, if, if you'll excuse me, I have a client.
One that wears pants.
The man exudes charm.
I have a feeling in a previous life he was a dust cover.
So, how's the preaching business?
Behind me.
I have to look to the future.
Mork, do you have any idea how old I am?
Wrong!
Next Wednesday afternoon I'll be 12 years old.
Whoa, you're awfully mature for your age.
Guilt without sex!
That's the key.
I'm too old to stand on street corners preaching.
I've got to settle down.
Get a straight conventional job.
What do you think you'd like to be?
Emperor of the Earth!
Exidor the Emperor.
Has a nice ring to it.
You won't be taking anybody else's job.
I know what I can do.
I'll help you get elected.
I'll be your campaign manager.
I know what we'll do.
First we'll get a tub to thump, some babies to kiss.
Then we'll get another set of lips so you can talk out of both sides of your mouth.
Mork!
Yes, yes!
I know it'll work.
Then we'll get you some hands to shake.
Some backs to slap.
We could get you some money to pass under a table.
A laundry to clean it, a Korean park.
Mork!
I know, we'll build a public image for you.
First of all, you'll have a debate.
You'll lose it.
You'll make a come-back.
Then you rent a motel.
You get Cuban burglars to break into it.
Then you have some tapes.
on the tapes.
Mork, wise up!
You can't get elected Emperor.
Do you have any idea who runs this world?
Wrong again!
I'll tell you who runs this world.
Joe Cocker!
No!
Yes.
Mick Jagger.
Him, too?
Bette Midler.
I'd serve under her.
Yes, rock stars, Mork.
Rock stars.
And they don't have a leader until now.
That's right.
I'm going to be the rock star.
That's why I'm taking lessons from Mrs. Hudson.
I'm going out on tour, Mork.
We'll start slow at first.
The Superdome The Garden Woodstock.
Then jump across the big pond England France.
: I'll take France in 26 days.
Then we sweep across Europe, amplifiers blaring.
We take Russia, China.
We take Africa.
And then they make me emperor.
Sounds reasonable.
You can say you knew me then, Mork.
You've been a good friend to me.
Anything you ever want, come to me.
Well, there is one favor I'd like to ask of you.
Name it.
Well, see, Mindy's been working very hard, and she needs a place Would you stop playing with that thing.
The man needs a favor.
No big deal.
Exidor, Mindy needs a place where she can go rest for a couple of days, get away from it all.
Would you like to drive or take a little hike?
I'll take the hike.
I have the perfect place.
My summer home.
You have a summer home?
I bought it four years ago when I was a doctor.
Now this is the scenic route.
You park your car here and walk the three miles to the cabin.
But that's a lake.
Oh you walk around the lake.
Exidor walks across the lake.
Thank you, Exidor.
Mindy'll really appreciate that.
An emperor takes care of his subjects.
Have a nice vacation.
You have a nice career, but there's one thing.
Your plan to become emperor sounds really good, but it relies on one thing your having talent.
Well, that's never stopped any rock group before.
Besides, you've never seen me perform.
Mork, you wait right here.
I'll get my ax.
Give me an intro, Mork.
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to get down into a tucked position 'cause you're gonna be blown out of your shorts and into your socks.
Here he comes, let's all get down here, get back up again.
Here he comes, the Duke of Disco, the Prince of Punk, the King of Rock and Roll, the future Emperor of the World, let's bring him out here, Exidor and the Proph-ettes!
: Lady of Spain, I adore you Right from the night I first saw you My heart has been yearning for you  Mork, I am freezing.
Come on, Mindy.
We're almost there.
Mork, I can't believe we finally made it.
I thought you were supposed to be such a trailblazer.
Well, I made it from Ork to Earth, but there were no trees.
I wonder when we lost the trail.
I suspect it was right before we fell off the cliff.
Well, I owe you an apology.
Next time you can land on me.
How's your ankle?
Ow.
It's still sprained.
But at least now the toes are finally facing forward.
Well, tomorrow morning I'll go looking for our luggage.
I hope it didn't sink.
Are you sure you heard a splash?
I don't know if it was that or the avalanche.
I hope that beaver isn't hurt.
Well, what was a beaver doing out strolling in the middle of the night anyway?
Why wasn't he in his darn dam guarding his sticks and his twigs?
Do you know how yucky it is to step on a beaver's tail?
I didn't know those little suckers could scream.
Well, he won't be sending any more little beaver messages with that tail for a while.
Mindy, you're not gonna have a nice weekend if you keep up with those negative thoughts.
Mork, I stepped on a beaver, I fell off a cliff and you landed on me, I sprained my ankle and my luggage is shooting the rapids on the way to Lake Mead.
And your scenic little three-mile hike was up the face of a cliff.
I knew we were in big trouble when that mountain goat tumbled by.
Boy, I didn't know they could scream either.
I'm cold and I can't walk anymore and I'm freezing to death.
But you're right.
You are right.
Why should I be negative?
What else could possibly happen?
Well, I could have lost the key.
Just open the door.
You lost the key?
No, he never gave me one.
What!
Mork, we'll freeze to death if we stay out here.
Kick the door in.
But it's my friend's Kick the door in.
But on Ork we Kick the door in.
But Kick.
Mork It wasn't locked.
Oh, dopey me!
Well, we better hit the sack now.
Tell you what, I'll flip you for the top bunk.
You can have it.
I don't think I could stand the climb.
Kay-o.
Looks like we'll be sleeping on Mr. Floor tonight.
Oh, I wish there was some way back to the car.
We got lost during daylight.
Imagine what it'd be like at night.
And, besides, that beaver's out looking for us.
You're right.
I guess there's nothing we can do but just make the best of this.
Well, you gotta look at the good side, though.
At least have three walls and a roof over our heads.
Well, if it wasn't snowing, the stars would be awfully pretty.
Oh, isn't this fun?
I love eating out.
I don't know.
Somehow I just can't picture John Wayne sitting in front of a roaring campfire roasting Vienna sausage.
That's all Exidor had in the cabinet.
That and the mouse.
Mork, that wasn't a mouse.
It was a moldy, fuzzy gray avocado.
But it crawled.
I know.
Do you know that the only thing between us and death is this fire?
We've gotta do something else to get warm.
Hey, wait a minute.
What about this little trunk?
Mindy, both of us couldn't fit in there.
Although it might be fun to try.
No, I mean, there might be some old blankets or clothes in there.
I know that.
Who do you think you're talking to, Morko the pinheaded boy?
Wait, don't open it.
Do you think that avocado could have crawled in there?
Wait!
No, there's no trail of guacamole, we're safe.
What's this?
Confessions of a Schizophrenic by Exidor as told to Exidor.
Here's something.
Wait.
Oh, wait.
Look, look his and hers prophet robes.
Well, at least they're made out of flannel.
Well, I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired.
Time to hit the old sack.
No place to hang, so I guess I'll just have to rough it and sleep horizontal.
No, Mork, you don't understand.
If we fall asleep and the fire goes out, we'll freeze to death.
You mean stiff city?
Oh, I suggest we stay awake.
We'll be as tight as two cubes in a tray.
Well, what do you do to stay awake when you go camping?
Well, we, we used to roast marshmallows and sing songs.
Sing songs, that's it.
Here we go, hit it.
Come on, Mindy.
Join in anytime.
Come on.
I don't know how to count backwards in Orkan.
Oh, bummer.
Here's one that's universal.
Kumbaya Well, what else can we do?
Well, we used to tell ghost stories by the campfire.
Oh, that'd be fun.
Let's do it.
Come on, come on, come on, let's do it.
No, I'm not telling you a ghost story.
Come on, come on!
No, you'll get scared.
I'm not telling you.
I won't get scared.
Besides, would you rather be a snow cone?
Let's do it.
Okay.
Uh, there was this spooky old house sitting at, way at the top of a hill No!
No!
All right, go ahead.
Oh, Mindy.
Hmm?
Wake up.
Wake up.
We fell asleep.
Look.
Oh, no.
We have to get it going again.
Here, stir the embers.
Oh, I'm so cold.
Cold.
Any matches?
Ah, okay.
I can't find the matches.
Oh, no.
I, I can't find my pockets.
I can't feel my hands.
I can't Oh, I've got my gloves on.
Oh, let's see.
Ah, ah!
I got 'em.
Oh, good.
Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, only one match left.
Oh, no.
But there's still six hours left until daylight.
If we don't get this fire going, we're not gonna make it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Okay.
Okay, read the instructions.
"Close cover before striking".
Look, Mindy, you can finish high school in your spare time.
Mork.
Please  I saw that in a movie once.
Hey, I've got it.
You can start the fire with your finger.
That's a great idea.
Except it only works when it's above 60 degrees.
Come on, Mindy.
We've gotta keep moving.
Gotta keep the circulation going.
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Mork, I can't.
Well, come on, girl.
You gotta take the bull by the tentacles.
Let's go.
Come on.
I can't, Mork.
I just, I can't.
Ah, you're right.
Who am I kidding?
I can't walk either.
Mindy.
Ah, I'm sorry I got you into this.
Ever since you've met me, I've been getting you into trouble.
Oh, Mork, don't be silly.
I wouldn't trade a minute of the time we've spent together.
You know, I remember the first time I saw you.
You had your suit on backwards.
I remember the first emotion you taught me happiness.
I'm just sorry that the last emotion we're sharing is fear.
Yeah, I guess I am afraid.
It's nice to be sharing it, though.
I know.
Mork, why don't you try to make it down the mountain yourself?
I mean, what have you got to lose?
You.
You know, whenever people have the time, they never get around to saying the things they really want to say.
Now I really want you to know how I feel.
You don't have to.
I know how you feel.
And I know how you feel.
You hear something?
What?
It sounds like a car.
Oh, Mork, you have to have a road to have a car.
: Lady of Spain, I adore you What's that?
It's the future emperor of the world.
And he just got my vote.
I told you to wait in the Jeep.
We can't just go barging in on them, after all, they've got a life.
Ah, Mork.
Have any trouble getting in?
You have a Jeep?
Yes.
About 30 yards away on a fire road.
I was packing to go out on tour and I remembered I hadn't given you a key to the cabin.
You mean we could have driven up here?
Sure.
But you said you wanted to go for a hike.
How'd you like the scenic route?
We don't make cliffs like that anymore.
Well, here's the key.
Have a nice weekend.
Exidor.
Mindy hurt her ankle.
Can you please give us a ride down the hill?
Sure, if you don't mind the seven of us jammed into one tiny little Jeep.
Seven people sounds wonderfully warm.
But his kind of people don't have much warmth.
Zippo.
I'm sorry what happened to the cabin.
What's wrong with it?
Well, let's go, boys.
Oh, sure is a beautiful night.
It sure is.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Oh, "For a good time, dial Mary Jo".
What do you have to report this week, Mork?
Oh, this week, Your Immenseness, I would like to discuss the silliness of Earth language.
Believe it or not, Your Acreage, here words can mean more than one thing.
That's illogical.
Ha, I know, sir.
Take, for example, the word "run".
Run can mean this rivers running people run down and men can run stores.
Miss Filmon, a sale in lingerie.
Also, the female of the species can get a run in her stockings.
: Oh, no.
It all sounds very confusing.
I know, sir, but they still manage to communicate.
For example, the word "buck".
They know when to pass it and when to spend it.
How do Earth people understand each other?
Many times they don't.
Sometimes humans find it very difficult to tell each other how they feel about one another until it's too late.
Pity.
I know, sir.
They have a strange custom here.
I believe people should receive flowers while they're still alive, not after they're gone.
For example, sir, I never told you that I like you and I do.
Orson Thanks.
Nanu.
How'd you know I had the munchies?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Na-nu, na-nu.
Shazbot!
Mindy, mind if we start without you?
No, go ahead.
I'll be out in a minute.
How about that new Pope, huh?
Well So King Kong's finally up the Empire State Building and he's got Fay Wray.
Hey, careful there, my son, you'll hurt yourself.
He's got Fay Wray and she says, : "Put me down, put me down".
He goes:  "Okay".
Yeah, I guess that kind of bit the big one.
You're right.
What is that?
!
Oh, Mindy, it's not a what.
It's a "who".
I'd like you to meet O'Keefe!
But you didn't tell me he was a chimpanzee!
I also didn't tell you he's on the lam.
He's a con.
He's a what?
He's a fugitive.
He said there's no zoo in the country that'll hold him inside.
Well, where did you find him?
Well, I was up in a tree observing bald spots on human beings.
I was up to 85 men and all of a sudden I realized something hairy was watching me.
So all of a sudden, I thought, "Hey, let's bring him home".
He'll cheer you up, and besides I'm not sending him back to the Big House with those rotten screws.
Mork, that's ridiculous.
He's got to go back to the zoo.
No!
You see?
No way.
They'll put him on banana bread and water.
They'll take away his tire.
Mindy, who are you kidding?
It's a jungle in there.
Mork, they don't do that to animals.
At the zoo he'll get food and protection and love.
Really?
Yeah.
And besides, running around free he might hurt himself.
Well I wouldn't want that to happen.
Well, you heard the warden.
I guess I've got to take you back to your cell.
I'm sorry, old friend.
Go upstairs and start packing.
But don't worry we'll arrange conjugal visits with Cheetah.
And I'll send you a banana with a file in it.
But look at this, Mindy.
He taught me a dance.
It's the funky-monkey hustle.
Watch.
Come on, Mindy don't be afraid.
Come on, don't be Mork, you've been acting awfully strange lately.
I mean, more strange than usual.
Ah, you've noticed.
Noticed?
How could I help it?
Like yesterday, you spent all day walking and talking backwards.
Well, that's all behind me now.
Well, what's next?
I'm glad you asked.
Well, today, I thought I'd go out and buy 400 balloons and a tank of nitrous oxide and some calves liver.
Mork, why are you doing all these strange things?
To cheer you up.
But I'm not sad.
But you will be after you hear the news that I have to tell you.
What news?
Well, I've got orders from Orson.
I've been transferred to another planet and I'll never ever see you again.
What?
Well, you've got to look at the good side.
You're not losing an alien.
You're-you're gaining an empty room.
Well, I have a very fine set here and it has some very good attachments that go with it.
Oh, yeah.
Okay I'll take them.
It-it doesn't work quite as well without the cord.
You're not going to be able to hear a thing.
Perfect.
I want to keep noise out.
If I hear anything, I'll bring them back.
Well, it's your money.
That'll be $50.
These work fine.
I didn't hear a word you said.
I said that'll be $50.
Will you take a check?
Certainly.
Fine.
Get it from your daughter.
Hey, wait a minute.
You just can't walk out of here.
What do you mean, get it from Mindy?
Listen, I live underneath your daughter and I work at home.
I write greeting cards.
Ah you're Buckley.
Bickley.
Yeah, Mindy's told me about you.
Well, Let me tell you about her.
I can't concentrate with all that racket.
How do you expect me to write sympathy cards with her crying all morning?
Crying?
Why was she crying?
Who cares?
Crying is crying.
Find out from her when you hit her up about the check.
Yes, but you just can't Oh, Dad Honey, what's wrong?
Oh, brother!
Honey, what is it?
Oh, something awful has happened.
Mork's been transferred to another planet.
I'll probably never see him again.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Oh when is he leaving?
In a couple of days.
Dad, what am I gonna do?
Mork he's just about my best friend, that's all.
I'm sure glad I don't read lips.
Mindy!
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
And Mindy's dad hi, Mr. McConnell.
Hello.
Hi, Susan.
Hi.
Listen, I was just in the jewelry store across the street buying myself a numero uno charm Susan, I think maybe some other time Oh.
Well, are we a little depressed today?
Yeah, she's a lot depressed.
Personal reasons.
Well, of course, I was never one to pry.
All I can tell you is, I used to get all these emotional ups and downs all the time at the least little thing.
But that was before I got ERK.
What's ERK?
Oh, Mindy E.R.K. Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning.
I don't mean to be picky, but you spell "conditioning" with a "C".
Right.
Maybe you do, but Ellsworth doesn't.
Ellsworth says that spelling is just another hang-up.
So, how about it?
Susan, I just don't feel up to it today.
Hey, grab yourself a cup and I'll split my lunch with you.
Thanks, but I'm not into toy cocktails.
Oh, well, Mindy, I mean, you can do this if you want, but just remember, you're going to be going through emotional ups and downs for the rest of your life until you find something like ERK.
You see, Ellsworth teaches you to love yourself.
I'll bet you got an "A".
"A" plus.
Ta-ta.
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
Hey, oh, have I got a surprise for you.
Oh, I've got a surprise for you.
There we stay.
Mindy, you'll never guess what's in the bag.
Take a flying guess.
Come on, take a flying guess.
Mork, I don't feel like guessing.
Okay, I'll guess it for you myself.
Time to play "What's my bag"!
: Uh, mystery object, are you a shovel?
: No!
Are you a Synanon joke book?
No.
I give up.
Well, I guess I'll have to tell myself.
And to present the prize, our lovely prize girl, Lola.
Thank you, Otto.
Guess what it is, Mindy!
It's a going away present for Mindy and it's an exciting new gift I got this morning on the street corner.
It's Zen-O-Matic.
It's a what?
It's Zen-O-Matic, the exciting new kitchen tool that does absolutely nothing.
That's right.
It can't dice, it can't peel, it can't chop it won't even make julienne fries whatever those are.
That's right, Zen-O-Matic does didley for you.
Yes, the exciting new kitchen tool from the people who brought you frozen sand and electric toothpaste.
Send absolutely nothing today to Buhdda Productions care of Nirvana, Box Omm Get one today!
I appreciate what you're trying to do.
I really do.
But I'm just not in the mood for it right now.
Well, you don't have to be sad on account of me.
How can I help it?
You're being sent off to some remote corner of the universe.
I don't even know where.
It's not that far away.
It's just the other side of the universe.
It's the Sigma Seven Galaxy.
It's a troubled planet called Tsoorus.
And the people there aren't very friendly, but the good thing is they're tiny.
Even in their most vicious mood, they can only bite you below the ankle.
How can you let Orson do this to you?
Well, maybe you're afraid of him, but I'm not.
Plug me into your head.
I want to talk to that fat fascist.
I guess I forgot to tell you.
You see, I talked to him this afternoon.
You did?
What did he say?
Well, Mindy, I've been thinking this over a lot and I don't think I'm very much good for you.
You know, I do silly things I make weird objects I talk to furniture and leave you out of the conversation I'm always getting in the way I bring home strange people.
I see.
Orson wouldn't change his mind.
No, I talked to Orson for a real long time and he said I could stay on Earth as long as I want.
He did?
!
That's wonderful.
Yeah, it's nice to have a choice and I chose to leave.
Mork, but why?
Why would you want to leave here?
Are you unhappy?
Is it something that I've done?
Oh, no.
It's something you have.
Emotions.
That doesn't make sense.
Oh, yes, it does.
See, one day I'm going to have to leave the earth, and it's going to hurt you very much.
I've only been here a few months and look how you feel.
Imagine what it would be like after ten years?
The longer I stay, the harder it will be for you.
But what about you?
Me?
The Cosmic Charles Bronson?
I don't have a heart.
It won't be a problem for me.
It's a problem for me.
I've got a big adjustment to make getting used to no Mork.
I know what I can do get O'Keefe out on parole.
It'll be almost like having me around.
It'll be a lot like having you around.
Oh, what a nice thing to say.
Who is it?
Miss McConnell Oh, no Mr. Bickley, please, we are not making any noise.
We're not doing anything.
I know that.
I was just downstairs feeling depressed.
I thought I'd come up here and share it with you.
Ah, Mr. Pickley!
That's nice.
That's Bickley.
Oh, Mindy, let him come in.
He has something to share.
Something really nice.
Mr. Bickley, I'm sorry to be rude, but I'm very upset right now.
Mork is leaving town.
Ha!
That's didley.
He's just going out of town.
I'm going out of business.
I used to be the best greeting card writer around.
But I can't work anymore.
Oh, come on.
We don't make that much noise.
I know.
I was blaming it on you, but it's time I faced it.
I've lost it.
Well, we could form a posse and find it if you want.
Oh, it's no use.
They say your sympathy is the first thing to go.
I used to be able to get tears out of a coat rack.
Not any more.
Listen to this.
"Your pet rabbit died, "Poor little Muffit "Your two choices are: Eat it or stuff it".
Oh, that's sad.
Mr. Bickley, you're just going through a writer's slump.
Mork is leaving for good.
Look, sister, little Muffit ain't coming back either.
Oh, none of us has a reason to be happy now.
I'll drink to that.
Knock-knock.
Well, what a group.
Hear No Evil, See No Evil and Feel No Pain.
What's wrong with you people?
I've lost my talent.
Mork is leaving.
The rabbit died.
You know you guys could just sit around here feeling depressed or you could all be straightened out by one little thing.
Paul Williams?
No ERK.
You people have got to get ERK.
You've been irking me since you came in.
Mindy, listen.
ERK would help you with your depression and Mr. Bickley you know, you could use some help with your drinking.
I drink fine by myself.
Oh, and, Mork, I bet he could come up with something for you.
Yeah.
That sounds exciting.
Come on, Mindy, let's not poop the party.
Ellsworth might be able to help both of us, and besides, I don't want to leave you like this.
Oh, Mindy, come on.
Look, it would do you some good and I am not going to take "no" for an answer.
I am going to sit right here until I get your word on it, and that goes for you, too, Mr. Hickle.
Bickley!
Oh, Ellsworth, before we get started I have a couple of friends I'm dying for you to meet.
Two of my closest friends in the entire world.
Uh, Mork and Mindy This is Ellsworth.
Oh, Ellsworth, you know, we're so lucky to have a man like you, so unselfish with a special gift Yeah, Excuse me.
Excuse me, could you hold that thought just a moment?
Oh, yes.
Okay, we're all set.
Now, what were you saying?
She was saying how nice it was that an unselfish man like you came all this way for a little thing like money.
Yeah, it sure is.
Okay, the agreement was for 8:00.
Let's begin the session, all right?
Oh, right.
Yes.
Oh, everybody, places, places.
Ellsworth is ready.
Boy, you're really going to hear something now.
Hellooo.
Hellooo.
Is that it?
You people are all dipsticks.
You're scuzz!
The next question is, of course, what will you be doing here?
Susan?
Well, we will be trying to find our own space.
Uh, very good, Susan, very good.
Yes, you have an item, Mork?
Uh A point of Ellsworth order.
Um my item is simply this.
It seems like Susan has her own space.
This is her apartment and there's barely enough room for any of us.
That's a joke.
You're out of order, pal.
But it's a reality.
Reality is nothing more than a concept.
Oh, but it's truth.
This is truth Sit down and shut up.
Thank you.
Now it's sharing time.
This is the time when you people will say whatever is on your mind.
Say whatever you think will set you free.
Who wants to begin here?
Susan.
Oh.
Um Well, it-it used to bother me and intimidate me that I was so much more beautiful than anyone else, but since I got ERK, I discovered that I just have to learn to live with the fact that I'm fun to be near, and just love myself as the rest of the world does.
Anyone else?
I'm having trouble understanding any of this.
Perhaps you can understand this.
Sit down and shut up.
Anyone else have something to share?
Uh, yeah.
Uh Wait.
I have some very fine Kentucky bourbon here.
I'd like to share it with somebody who has some soda.
Obviously you're new.
You don't know about our agreement.
Getting ERK is not easy.
Sometimes these sessions last up to 15 hours and during that time, there will be no eating.
Who cares?
No going to the bathroom.
Big deal.
No drinking.
Wait till you try to cash my check.
I have something that I would like to share.
ERK is not a process.
ERK is something that happens in space.
In fact it may be space.
It's definitely not space.
Space is a continuum an inf wait.
Don't tell me.
"Sit down and shut up".
Yes, Mindy, you have an item?
My item is that I paid a lot of money to come here and learn something.
Well, then you've learned something important already, haven't you?
What?
You have been conned.
That's terrible.
"Terrible" is just a concept.
Oh, I get it.
Anything that you don't want to talk about is just a concept.
No, not my Rolls-Royce.
That's real.
Why don't you go ahead and sit down, Mindy?
We've caught your act.
Well.
Mr. Ellsworth, I have another point of order.
Yeah, go right ahead.
Thank you, I think it's a biggie.
People don't come here for humiliation and abuse.
Every creature in the universe is entitled to respect.
Ridiculous.
Nobody wants to hear that message.
Sit down and shut up.
But you said to say what was on our mind.
Well, I've changed the rules.
But not before I get one more thing in.
I think you should be honest with yourself, like yourself, trust yourself and know yourself.
That's all you ever need to know.
Oh, Mork, that's beautiful.
Did Orson tell you that?
No, Leon Spinks.
Oh, there's one other thing I'd like to talk about This concept of not letting people go to the bathroom.
Well, I myself can't sit still for that and I think we should all take a rest break right now.
What do you think, everyone?
Yeah.
Take a rest break, everyone.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What about the agreement?
I think we just changed the rules.
All right.
All right, those people want to leave?
Those people who want to drop out, fine.
I'm still the winner.
I get to go home early.
I've got all your money and most importantly, I've got my Rolls-Royce.
Thank you so much.
Well, he's cute.
My Rolls-Royce.
My Is Somebody has stolen my Rolls-Royce.
Well, don't worry, Ellsworth, just losing your Rolls-Royce is a concept.
Getting it back is a reality.
Well, it's good-bye, apartment.
Fern, I love ya.
Phil, get rid of that dendron.
Sofie, you've been a great lie.
Take it easy, chair.
Good-bye, walls.
Good-bye, air.
Good-bye, little tiny dust particle.
Good-bye, electrons.
Good-bye, protons.
Good-bye, nucleus.
Mork, before you finish saying your good-byes, which at this rate could be some time around mid-September, I want to talk to you for a minute.
I've been doing some observing, and I learned something last night at the meeting.
You don't practice what you preach.
Mayday.
Sense of verbal confusion.
Well, at the meeting last night, you talked about knowing yourself.
Well, let me tell you something.
You might not have had emotions when you arrived here, but you've got them now.
I don't.
Sit down and shut up.
Nobody could have said all those wonderful things without feeling them.
And I figured something else out, too.
You're not leaving because of me.
You're leaving because of you.
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
I'm not, I'm not.
You're the one who won't be able to handle leaving if you stay much longer.
Me?
Yeah, I don't want to go home.
It's cold out there.
Who else will let me do the things you do?
I'm gonna miss you.
I feel humiliation and guilt.
Oh, Mork, you don't have to feel guilty about having emotions.
Oh, yeah.
Orson said emotions are bad for you.
We'll never evolve if you have emotions.
Shh!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Boy, is he a nimnull!
Where are you going?
I'm going upstairs to talk to Orson.
I'm not leaving.
You're not?
No way.
Boy, having feelings is good.
I'm back, Jack.
Mork, calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork, calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork, calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Taxi!
Orson speaking.
Well, are you ready to leave?
Oh, no, Your Immenseness.
I've decided to stay.
Mork, are you sure you want to extend your Earth visit?
Oh, yes, Your Girthship.
I want to continue my observation of human emotions especially guilt.
Emotions?
Does everyone have them?
Absolutely everyone.
Well, with the possible exception of a few presidents.
What are presidents?
Well, they're elected officials who are sent to Washington every four years to bring the country to financial ruin, recognize Chinese and throw a baseball out once every spring.
Is that all?
Well, I've also observed that they never tell a lie, but then again, they never tell the truth.
It's something called politics.
And they also have a power that's feared very much by everyone called "veto".
What's that?
I'm not sure, but I think it's an Italian bodyguard.
Sounds dull.
Oh, no, sir.
The big bucks comes when you get to be an ex-president.
Then publishers pay you millions of dollars to write things called memoirs, but the strange part is they don't have very good memories, and the really funny part is no one buys those books.
Well, that's all she wrote, Your Fatship, Catch you next week.
Nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Mork, what's that?
It's a scrapbook, so I can take back memories from the planet Earth.
Oh, that's really nice.
A scrapbook of Earth.
Uh, what are you putting in there?
Flags of different countries, pictures of our world leaders?
Hey, save it for the Republicans, Mr. Eisenhower.
I'm going to put some real fun stuff in here.
Something for the real people, some big yuks.
Look at this.
An example of some of your Earth poetry.
Huh, let's see.
"There once was a girl from Dundee, who" Where did you get this?
From the poetry cubicles down at the basketball arena.
You must really love poetry, because they're all lined up to pay a dime to sit down and write poetry.
I think I'll go read some poetry.
Look at this here.
Mm-hmm.
Now what is this?
What is this?
It's a souvenir from a wrestling match.
A wrestling match?
When did you ever go to a wrestling match?
Well, they have them every weekend down by the lake in those parked cars.
Every time I walked by, one of these came out.
Hi Mindy.
Hi, Mork.
Hi, Sally.
Oh, Little Jody.
Wow, he's really gotten big!
Yeah, he's my little man, all right.
You don't look like you're made out of snakes and snails and puppy dog tails.
Is this the person who used to live in your stomach?
The former bulge?
Yeah.
Oh, he's so tiny.
How did he ever get out of there?
Well, I think the doctor helped him out, Mork.
I know.
He slipped him a map and a compass and said, "You're on your own, clone.
Good luck".
Here, why don't you hold him a while.
No, no, I, I don't speak small.
Whoa!
Be careful.
So, what can I help you with?
He's so cute.
What do you two talk about when you're alone?
Well, nothing yet.
Jody can't talk.
Oh, a little mute.
It's okay.
My name is Mork.
Nanu-nanu.
Don't worry, Mork.
In a couple of months, he'll be chattering like crazy.
Yeah, I'll have the fun of teaching him new words.
Oh, no, you shouldn't teach him new words.
You should use the old words like everyone else uses, or else they'll think he's an idiot.
I know about that, boy.
Yeah, that's good advice, Mork.
Yeah, and I'll teach him to eat by himself, and walk.
He's got a lot to learn.
Ah, look, I taught him how to hug.
I'll just take these two.
Okay.
Good.
Oh, he's really incredible.
Mindy, can we get one?
Can we order one today?
How about it?
Hmm?
Can we get one, hmm?
He's fantastic.
Maybe we can send away for one.
Well, maybe you and Mindy ought to get together sometime, and talk.
No matchmaking, Sally.
Who, me?
Hey, don't suck on that.
You don't know where it's been.
That's fantastic.
He doesn't have any teeth!
Who's the father, Leon Spinks?
Come on, Jody.
You've got to be real careful.
He's real tiny, and he's fragile, you know?
You might hurt him some way.
Uh, Mork.
Oh.
You probably know that, don't you?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
I'll treat him just as if he were my own son.
Here you go.
Oh, thanks Take care.
We'll have to get together soon.
Yeah, good.
Thanks a lot.
Bye-bye.
Take care, little fella.
There's no place to grow but up!
Wasn't he cute?
Yeah.
For a guy who doesn't move very much, he sure sweats a lot.
You know, I think he likes me a lot.
You know how I can tell?
How?
'Cause when I was hugging him, he made a little noise like this Eh!
What does that mean?
Oh, Mork, that was just a little You're right.
That was his way of telling you that he likes you.
Oh, I knew it.
Kids are such a gas.
I wish I had one of my own.
Can men have babies, too?
Well, they can help.
It's sort of like a union.
Oh, you mean, like the Teamsters.
Mm, well it's not exactly like the Oh, sure, I hear about women in labor all the time.
No, it's not done like that.
How do you do it?
Uh, why don't you ask my father?
He's real good at things like this.
I have to go back here and work on something.
You're going to have to confront the situation someday.
Dad, how do they do it?
Uh, how do who do what?
How do they, how do they make babies?
Like, I know where they come from.
I'm no pinhead, but how do they get them in?
Do they blow them up?
Do they add water?
What happens?
What do they do?
Uh, well Mork, how a baby is born isn't as important as the miracle of creation.
You don't know either, do you?
Well, it's been a long time since Mindy was born.
Oh.
She must have been a lot of fun to hold.
She sure is now.
She was wonderful.
I can't tell you what it's like to have a little, helpless baby completely dependent upon you.
I've never had anything dependent upon me.
Well, don't worry, someday you'll have a child or something of your own.
Thank you.
I can't wait.
Boy, I'm headed back now.
Mindy, I'll catch you back at the apartment.
Yes, sir, she's my baby, no, sir  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, Western Union!
Howdy.
Doody.
Could I, could I see ya for a couple of seconds?
A thousand one, one thousand two.
Now, you know don't make yourself a stranger anymore, Come on back anytime, You all come back now, you hear?
Wow, deja vu!
Now you can close the door.
Yes, sir, glad to see you in here.
Friend, uh, you don't know me Oh, yes I do.
I saw you in the music store, then you followed me to the grocery store.
Glad to see you here once again.
Right.
Now, when I was in that music store, I couldn't help but notice that you were really enjoying holding that small baby.
Oh, yeah.
I never held one before, and I really liked it.
And didn't I hear you say you'd like one of your own?
Yeah, but it's physically impossible, you know?
I don't have a test tube.
But I'd give anything to have one.
Would you give $10,000?
Hey!
What?
You see, I know this couple with a baby, and they're trying to find a real nice home for it, you understand?
If I don't give you the money, they're going to turn it out, into the woods, and it'll be raised by rabbits?
Whatever you say, buddy.
Oh, I can't let that happen.
He might never take care of himself, and he might get a little fur ball caught in his throat.
Or worse unless you take care of it.
Of course, that's, uh, that's up to you.
All right.
I'll do anything you want.
I'll get the money for you.
You got yourself a deal.
Fantastic.
I'll, uh, I'll call you in the morning, all right?
Oh, and, uh, one thing, don't breathe a word of this to anyone.
Anyone.
Whew.
Okay.
But I have to borrow money from somebody.
What do I tell them?
That's your problem, kid.
My, uh, my friends don't like publicity.
Remember, one word, no deal.
No pressure.
Well, I guess I better do this to save the kid.
And, besides, I'm going to be a father.
I'll be able to teach him to walk, to talk, maybe to fly an egg.
Yeah, I'll, I'll be in touch.
Take care.
Yeah.
Oh, greasy.
I'm going to have a baby!
Kay-o, Jose!
Oh, I feel kind of strange, kind of dizzy.
I feel a sudden craving for pickles and ice cream.
Mindy!
Sweetheart, darling.
Long time no see, honeybunch.
Dynamic to see you again, darling.
Can I, can I ask you just a small favor?
What?
Can I have $10,000?
No.
Why not?
I really need it.
I got to have it, please, please, please, please?
Now, what could you possibly need that costs $10,000?
Um, socks.
Socks.
Gucci socks.
$10,000 worth of Gucci socks?
Well, that's four pair and a garter.
Listen Mork, I'd really like to help you out, but I don't have that kind of money.
What kind do you have?
I have the kind that jingles.
You know, the kind you use in gum machines.
Oh, humor.
What do you need $10,000 for, anyway?
Oh, it's for a big surprise.
It's real expensive, but I know you'll love it.
Uh, you're not going to help me?
Okay.
All right.
What can I do to get $10,000?
I can always go to Jesus.
That'll cost me an arm and a broken leg.
I know, you can try selling apples.
That's right!
Apples!
Let's see, at a nickel apiece that's 20,000 apples, No.
We can sell one big apple on steroids for $10,000.
No, wait, I can baby-sit for mainland China.
No.
I could teach etiquette to Billy Carter!
No!
I could sell dental floss to the Osmonds!
Listen, you think of something.
I'm going to go in the bedroom right now and change my clothes, but I will be back to discuss this with you later.
I'll be your valet for $2,000.
Well, in case I do get the money, I better practice being a father.
Eh, here's my little surrogate baby.
Here we go.
Yay.
Finkundoo hatchling, finkundoo fee Finkundoo hatchling, finkundoo Oh, fantastic, I love you so.
Why didn't you tell me you had to do that?
Excuse me, ladies.
Hi.
May I show you some disco records?
No, thanks.
I'm with the F.B.I. Oh.
Well, maybe I can show you some Police records.
Can I help you?
Yes, I'd like you to look at this photograph and tell me if you've ever seen this man before.
Hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
This guy was hanging around here yesterday.
Who is he?
He's a creep who kidnaps and sells babies.
We were tailing him yesterday when he followed a woman with a baby into this store.
Oh, my God, that was Sally!
Is he after her baby?
He could be, but don't worry.
We're watching him.
Oh, thank goodness.
The odd thing is, when he left here, he didn't follow her.
He followed some strange-looking man with suspenders to your house, Miss McConnell.
To my house?
What would he be doing at my house?
That's what we want to ask you.
Uh, does a strange man with suspenders give you a clue?
Oh, Dad, Mork wouldn't do anything wrong.
Wait a minute.
How much does this guy sell babies for?
$10,000.
Well, what I meant was, Mork wouldn't do anything wrong intentionally.
Ma'am, if you think your friend is trying to buy a baby, relax.
He's not in trouble.
We want the kidnapper.
You wouldn't arrest him?
Absolutely not.
Well, then I think my friend Mork might be trying to buy a baby.
Yesterday, when I came home from work he asked me if he could borrow $10,000.
Did you give it to him?
No, I don't have that kind of money!
Well, you do now.
Oh, I don't know about this.
Miss McConnell, we must have your help.
Well, I guess if the guy is such a creep, I guess Mork would want to help, too.
No, no.
You can't tell him.
This guy is sharp, and if he thinks he's being set up, we'll lose him again.
He's right, dear.
Mork is no actor.
Now, I want you to call me the minute you know when and where the transfer is being made.
Good day.
This is the famous Orkan atom smasher!
Let me show you how this works.
First, get one government atom  There's one put it under there  Flatto!
I'll clean up that mess later, but actually if we'd split the atom we'd all be dead meat by now, but let's move on quickly.
It can also crush nuts.
See the nut?
I see the nut.
Thank you.
Mork, I've got the money you need.
$10,000.
Oh, Mindy, that's fantastic.
Oh no, you didn't Oh, poor child I didn't.
I got a raise.
You got a raise?
That's wonderful.
Well what's this?
Um I dried the clothes in the microwave.
No, actually actually, it's better than that.
You see, I made this for my favorite TV star : Boss, my shirt has landed.
: Give it to me, Tattoo, I want to wear it that's my fantasy.
Um Look at that look at that ring, isn't it amazing?
Look at the size of that sucker, boy.
I bet Elizabeth Taylor doesn't even have one of these.
No, she doesn't.
It's uh a seeing eye rattle for a blind snake.
Saved by the bell.
Telephone.
Yello?
Oh, howdy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure, I've got the money.
See?
Yeah, tomorrow at noon?
At the bus station.
Uh, yea uh Mindy, this is a private call.
Do you mind if I take it in there?
No, go right ahead.
Thank you.
He hung up.
Roadways next bus to Denver will be leaving Boulder at 3:00.
Uh is this seat taken?
Thank you.
Attention the 3:30 bus to Los Angeles will now be departing at 4:45.
Nice day, huh?
Oh, on a liquid diet.
No, I'm I'm expecting a baby.
Not literally.
Boy, that'd be funny, wouldn't it?
Whoa.
Yeah, should be coming through anytime now, you know.
A little guy, so helpless, so tiny.
That's why I'm here to take care of him.
I'm the father figure.
Yeah, he's only six months old and I haven't seen him in two years.
Called me up the other day on the phone.
Kind of a strange conversation.
All he knows is  How he got his little fingers in the dial, I'll never know.
So I says to him Boy, you're about as much fun as I guess the firstborn means a lot to a father.
That's what I'm going to be.
Whew.
Here's my man now.
I'm over here!
I'm over here!
Don't you know what's happening here?
Oh, yeah.
I'm going to give you $10,000 and you're going to give me a baby.
Would you shut up?
You'll wake up the baby.
Now, where's the money?
Here it is.
Okay.
Easy.
I want to make sure it's all here.
Okay, here's your kid.
Oh.
Hold it, scuz!
I want to make sure he's all here.
Oh, he's all there, but I'm not so sure about you.
Well, thank you.
It's been a pleasure dealing with a Stetson stork.
Passengers are now disembarking from Aspen and Vale.
You're under arrest.
Up against the wall.
Attention Mr. Dan Benton, please report to the desk.
Hands behind your back.
I'm telling you, you got the wrong guy.
Sure we do.
You are Chuck Wilson, alias Chuck Martin, alias Charles Henthorne.
See?
You don't know who you got.
We got you this time.
This money is marked.
Take him out to the car and read him his rights.
Well let's get the baby and take him back to his parents.
Okay.
He's gone!
He must have slipped out the back.
Well don't worry.
I'm sure he's going back to Miss McConnell's house.
I better get her on the phone at the store.
and the beautiful princess said, "If I kiss you, will you buy me a Halston dress and take me to Long Island and build me a condominium"?
And the jive toad said, "Sho, mama, anything you want".
And so, the princess kissed the ugly toad, and lo and behold, she croaked.
She keeled right over.
Splat.
And her little tiny crown rolled down the hill, because the toad was wearing poisoned lip gloss.
Here's the moral of the story never kiss a toad in drag.
There we go It's time for us to get rocking, here.
Here we go.
Oh let's get down, get funky.
There we go.
There we go Finkundoo hatchling dee bo klaykoo Bon de dan derso you're waiting too  Boy, I'm so proud to be a father.
I can't wait for you to meet your God-moose, too.
I'm a father, here Chuck, here's a cigar.
Thank you, Carl.
Mindy, Mindy, look, I'm a father.
You'll never believe what happened.
All of a sudden, this little guy followed me all the way home, and all of a sudden I heard a little tiny knock at the door  and he crawled right in, you know.
That's fantastic!
Mork Okay.
Here's what really happened.
I was walking down the street, and I saw these bullrushes, and there was a burning bush you know?
And all of a sudden this big voice said, "Take him home, it'll be all right".
Mork I know, oh dopey me.
I should never get my alibis out of a best-seller.
Um here's the truth, this is what really happened you see, his parents abandoned him and they'd leave him in the woods and he'd be raised by rabbits and who knows what would happen when hunting season would come along?
He might end up on a little chain as a good luck charm, you know what I mean?
Mork Mindy, please!
See, he's fantastic, and I'll be a great father.
I'll love him, I'll care for him, I'll feed him, I'll do everything he needs, and besides I named him after you.
Oh, Mork, you're not making this easy at all.
I don't want to make it easy for you.
He's fantastic.
You can't send him Mork, you can't keep him.
Why not?
I paid good money for him.
Well that's just it, it's against the law to buy a baby.
No it isn't, the guy who sold him to me says he sells them all the time.
That's right, and he's going to jail because of that.
Are they here to take him back?
I'm afraid they are.
But don't you understand?
His parents were mean, nasty people.
That guy lied to you, Mork.
This baby was stolen.
His parents love him very much, and they want him back desperately.
All right, you get the baby, and I'll contact the office.
No, no, no.
I'll give him back to you.
Shh, shh.
Wait.
You've got to keep him real dry, because he's kind of like a dribble glass with arms.
And, oh, you've got to keep him real warm, too.
Got to keep him wrapped up real tight.
And if he ever makes a noise like this  that means he likes you.
Take care, little fella.
Good-bye, little Mindy.
Top of the world, Ma.
Miss McConnell, Thank you.
We'll be in touch.
I'm going to miss him.
Oh, Mork, I'm so sorry things worked out like this.
Yeah, me, too.
I feel so bad.
You understand I had to do that, I had to give him to those people.
I know.
I didn't know his parents loved him so much and wanted him back.
I can't blame them.
I don't know what to say.
I just feel so sorry for you.
Oh, you don't have to feel sorry for me.
Now I know what it's like to be a father.
It's really wonderful.
Even being a father for an hour is better than being never a father at all.
You're really amazing.
And besides, I would have made a lousy father.
I couldn't even get the kid to eat.
Mork, calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork, calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Hey, laser breath.
Mork, calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork, calling Orson  I read you, Mork.
What have you got for me this week?
Oh, something very special, Your Immenseness.
This week, I was a father for an hour.
That's wonderful.
What's a father?
Oh, you remember a mother?
Well a father is the male counterpart.
If you have a mother, why do you need a father?
Sounds like featherbedding to me.
Oh, no.
A father's very important.
He gives the child love.
You told me that's what the mother did.
Oh, but a child needs lots of love so he can grow big and strong in here.
That's a father's whole function?
No.
Just loving?
Oh, no, Your Fattitude.
You see, a father serves another purpose, too.
He provides food, shelter, leadership, and according to recent facts, he works very hard, worries a lot, and dies young so his family can go on living.
Who would apply for a job like that?
You know, between the mother and the father, children receive so much of everything, they must be grateful.
Oh, no, sir, you see, they take it for granted, until it's gone.
Then they miss it.
Well, I don't understand why anybody would want to be a parent.
Orson, it's one of those situations where you have to be there.
Because once you hold this, this little, tiny baby in your arms, this eensy, teensy tiny being  it makes it all worthwhile.
Personally, I'll stick with the test tubes.
Oh, que sera sera.
Until next week, Your Immenseness Nanu-nanu.
Andiamo.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Oh, Friday night?
Oh, I can't, Sally, it's my birthday.
Oh, thanks.
No, I'm already spending it with somebody.
Yes, it's somebody pretty special.
Okay, good.
All right, I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.
Hi.
You're spending your birthday with somebody special?
Yeah Let me guess.
Menachem Begin?
No.
Jimmy Carter.
No.
Frank Zappa.
No.
Pope John Paul.
No.
I'm planning on spending my birthday with you.
Oh, heavy sigh.
Another lonely night again for the Pope polishing those little red shoes.
Mork, we'll go someplace really nice for dinner.
We'll laugh and celebrate and have a really good time.
How's that sound?
Rotten.
Rotten?
Why?
Don't you want to be with me on my birthday?
Oh, positively, but, see, something happened last night that's going to affect the rest of my life, if I live that long.
What?
Oh, last night when I was sleeping I had little talking pictures in my head.
Oh, you mean you had a dream?
Oh, I know it wasn't a movie 'cause when I woke up, there was no gum under my seat.
I don't know if it was a dream or not.
All I know is it was terrifying, and you were in it, too.
Me?
What did I do?
Don't play dumb!
We started off first by going to this human car-wash and being covered in Shake and Bake.
And the entire cast of The Untouchables was there, too.
And then we ended up in this big hot tub where we played "Connect the Dot" with each other's freckles and bobbed for wet things.
And then, suddenly, you were in another man's arms!
Exit grief, enter rage!
And as he turned around horror!
It was me!
And I started carrying on like I wasn't even there.
How could I do this to me?
Good old grief, then jealousy!
I started slapping myself around, hitting myself all over the place.
And there was a little man in the background going "Don't worry, it'll be cute.
Don't worry".
And then, as I started fighting and fighting among myself, fighting among myself, you said, "That's all right, stop!
Stop, I'll choose between you"!
Mindy, my whole emotional life is passing before me.
Mork, don't worry.
All you had was a bad dream.
People have them all the time.
Mindy, don't you understand?
See, Orkans don't have dreams.
We cut them off bleems ago when we cut off our emotions.
Mork, you claim that Orkans have no emotions, and yet you show them all the time.
Watch your mouth!
You do, face it.
You're right.
Sometimes I do get an occasional pleasure out of flashing them in the raincoat of my mind.
But now it's different.
They've crept into my subconscious, and they Well, last night they snuck out and they had a good old time.
They used me.
Oh, I feel so cheap and dirty.
They'll probably never even call me in the city.
But, Mork, showing emotions is healthy.
Really?
Yeah.
But Mindy, that's a no-no no-no for a nanu-nanu.
Mindy, I've made a decision, and I don't think you're going to like it very much.
What is it?
Well, I've got to stop this before they take me completely over, so I've got this little door in the back of my mind, I'm going to round up all my emotions, put them behind that door, lock it, and hide the key in my foot.
Are you saying that you won't feel anything anymore?
Right on.
Strike up the bland.
Good-bye, Mindy, I'm closing off my emotions forever.
Wait a minute, Mork!
Don't!
You can't do this to yourself.
Mindy, don't you understand?
These emotions have been locked up for thousands and thousands of bleems.
If they get out, they'll be dangerous.
You don't know what'll happen.
Talk about your sailors on leave.
Mork, if you study human beings, you'll find out that we can't get along without emotions.
Oh, I've studied them.
World War I, World War II, Watergate.
Well, then study them closer at work.
I mean, people can't get along without emotions.
I mean, after all, it's what sets us apart from the animals.
But, you see, on Ork only animals have emotions.
And that's the way it should be, according to Prime Minister Fluffy.
What's the matter, Eugene?
My pet lizard Herbie died.
Yeah, that is too bad.
I don't what happened to him.
Maybe he ate a rancid fly.
I'm really feeling down.
Well, maybe it would help if you cried.
No way.
My dad says big boys never cry.
Oh, interesting; not showing emotion.
Come along, Eugene.
He does cry.
I've seen him.
Recently?
No, not recently.
Aha!
Hi, toots.
Hi.
Uh, what can I do for you?
Caress me with your eyes.
Say, uh, have you got any disco records?
Yes, we do, right over here.
This is the disco section.
I love to hear my chains rattle.
Say have you got Night Fever by the GeeBees?
Excuse me, I have to go somewhere.
Mork, help me out.
Will you go will you go wait on that guy?
Why?
What's wrong?
Well, he's got on this ridiculous toupee, and I'm afraid I'm going to laugh in his face, please.
Well, you're hiding your emotions.
I thought you told me laughing was good.
Laughing is good, but in this case I might hurt the guy's feelings.
Pishtosh!
I'm sure he'd be glad to know his hair brings joy to the world.
Watch this.
I'll handle it.
Excuse me, sir.
Oh, hi.
Groovy.
Did you know you bring joy to the world?
Yeah, it's my natural charisma.
No, no, it's that silly hair.
What are you talking about?
Well, I've seen wavy hair before, but never hair waving.
Look at that!
Wait, wait, wait!
Well, hair today, gone tomorrow.
Mork, people really need their emotions.
It's not the same thing, anyway.
Look, Mork, I don't care what you say.
You can't shut off your emotions.
Well, you haven't convinced me that I need them.
So on behalf of my emotions, I'd just like to say good-bye, sayonara, ciao, ta-ta, catch you later, mama, and shalom.
It's been nice feeling you.
Wait a minute, Mork, don't!
Come on, don't.
: It's too late.
The door is locked.
My emotions are shut off forever.
And so's the Mork that I like so well.
Don't worry.
We can go on having the non-emotional equivalent of fun.
There are certain advantages.
Watch.
Didn't that hurt?
You bet.
Ow, it's killing me.
So, what's the advantage of that?
I can hurt myself all day without bothering other people.
Mork, that door in your head, can that ever be re-opened?
Yes, but I can't do it, because what's behind there is far too dangerous.
You know something?
You are really dumb.
Nice try, but insults to a man with no emotions is like hay fever to a man with no nose.
Oh, Mork, I hate you like this.
I mean, you're ruining my birthday.
Another nice attempt for an Earthling, but no match for the incredible hulking will of an Orkan.
Darn it, Mork, open that door!
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in.
Mork, you were such a terrific guy the way you were.
I mean, you were so, you were so much fun to be with, and now look at you.
You're, you're unemotional, you're cold.
It feels like part of you has died.
If you think you can get to me by crying, you're wrong.
: Mindy, it : Fall back, mayday, system to be defense line "B", shore up defenses, sandbag tear ducts, think baseball, baseball.
Ah, once again I'm in control.
No problem.
I can deal with you as any other person with invitingly soft skin rosebud lips and sweet little eyes that leak cute little drops that roll gently down your cheeks.
I'm getting to you, aren't I?
Not this fella.
Come on, Morky, open up the door.
Why don't you show Mindy where you tucked away all those little emotions, hmm?
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
All systems overload, fall back, defense line "B", prepare for assault system!
You show me yours, I'll show you mine.
Never, never!
The door!
It's breaking, the door is Mindy, run for your life, the emotions are coming!
Aha, free at last!
All you emotions, follow me!
Mork, don't!
Mindy!
What are you doing?
I'm not Mork.
I'm Mork's Lust.
Come on now, girlie girl.
I saw her first!
Get away from her, Jealousy.
What the hell are you doing?
!
Don't hurt him.
He has a right Okay, please, okay!
Mama All of you emotions, come on!
We've got a lot of catching up to do!
Let's go, boys!
Yeah!
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, help!
It just doesn't seem possible that emotions could so change a person.
Well, it's all my fault.
I kissed him, and bingo.
Well, at least, dear, you got a kiss.
When I go out with a man, it's usually just for Bingo.
Well, I guess that's what happens when you bottle up your emotions for so many years.
Oh, honey, don't blame yourself.
You were only trying to help Mork be like other human beings.
Well, excuse me!
Why don't you ever sell any of this stuff?
!
What's wrong?
Oh, Mindy, that wasn't me, that was Anger.
Oh.
Well, what happened to your other emotions?
I think they're sleeping it off in my mind.
Oh, it's been a hard day's night, I can't tell you.
I'd lock them all up behind there except Anger's standing guard.
Yeah, and I'm a big boy, too!
And don't mess with me!
Oh, get off!
It's okay now.
See?
Where have you been?
Don't ask.
I've done things that would embarrass Idi Amin.
Like what?
Well, we started off by going to the waterfront.
Wait a minute.
There's no waterfront in Colorado.
Who says we stayed in Colorado?
Here's some shells.
We started off by going to this really cheap dive called The Ballpark.
Fear didn't want to go in, but Disgust called him a sissy.
And Excitement was so titillated by that he went to the bar and ordered ten beers, one for each finger.
Guilt felt so bad about that he yanked us in the alley.
Whimsy said it must be named Mohammed.
Shut up!
Let me finish the story!
Suddenly, we were surrounded by a vicious motorcycle gang.
There were 12 of us against 42 of them.
Anger is still spitting leather.
Mork, whatever happened to the positive emotions like Love?
Oh, yes.
I don't know what I said to that girl on the street corner.
All I remember is that she sold her car and gave all the money to me.
Well, at least you seem all right now.
Yeah, but that's just for the moment.
Who knows when they'll come out again, anytime Yeah!
See?
I can't go to your birthday party, Mindy.
It'll ruin the birthday for you.
Oh, Mork, the only thing that would ruin my birthday is if you're not there.
Yeah, you're right.
I'm a heck of a guy.
What's that?
Oh, Grandma made me this for my birthday.
Isn't it nice?
Yeah, I knitted it myself.
It took me five weeks.
Five weeks?
Hah!
What did you use for knitting needles, crowbars?
Uh, I think my emotions are waking up again.
I noticed.
Unfortunately, they're coming out at the wrong times, aren't they?
Yeah, I think they're trying to get out and teach me a lesson and show me who's boss.
Not now!
It's okay.
See?
I hope I don't embarrass you tonight.
Oh, Mork, I got you into this, and we're going to work this out together, okay?
Don't worry.
Oh, thanks.
That felt real nice.
Now see?
See how nice emotions can be when they start behaving themselves?
Yes, that was fantastic.
That was terrific Come on, mama, lay another wet one on me!
Come on!
Good evening.
Good evening.
May I, uh, help you?
Yes, we have reservations for two under the name of McConnell for 8:00.
Very well, I'll just check my list.
There must be some mistake, there's no McConnell anywhere on this list.
But I made the reservations two days ago.
Tonight's my birthday, it's a special occasion.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, you'll just have to try us on another special occasion.
: Maybe you didn't hear the girl!
How about you gettin' her a table right now or I'll tear off your lips, paste them to your eyes, so you can see what you're going to say, how about that, Huh?
Get us a table right now!
Haul it, haul it now!
Uh, yes, sir, yes, sir.
I'll, uh Here we are, sir.
Uh, this one just became available.
This is nice, but it's awfully close to the kitchen.
Well, it guarantees your food will arrive piping hot.
I just can't sit next to the kitchen with all that, that clattering and gibberish and foreign tongues.
I mean, oy vey, Maria, this is ridiculous.
And if I sit by this tacky swinging door and catch a disease, I'll sue you silly, I will.
Oh, my God, I'm hypoglycemic.
Here I go.
Uh, uh, right this way, please.
Here we are, this is uh, Chez Michel's finest table.
Oh, it's wonderful.
It's more than that, it's delightful, it's de-lovely, it's delicious.
Thank you, thank you.
This is fantastic!
Thank you, thank you!
Oh, sell my clothes, I'm going to heaven.
And we hope you have a safe and speedy trip.
Nanu-nanu.
I didn't know my emotions could work so well for me.
Well, yeah, they're real nice, Mork, but I still think they're coming out a little too strong.
Oh, but if it wasn't for them, we'd be celebrating your birthday at Biffy Burger.
Bon soir, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
Might I recommend the chateaubriand with sauce Michel and carrots glace.
And to begin, salad endive with dressing Polonaise.
Ooh, that sounds terrific.
Very well, Mademoiselle.
Oh, by the way, do you have Thousand Island dressing?
It's my favorite.
I'm so sorry, we do not carry Thousand Island dressing.
Oh, that's too bad, No Thousand Island dressing?
Oh, please, those are her favorite little islands.
Oh, this is terrible, Mindy.
Oh, Mindy, I-I can't go on!
Mindy, I can't go on!
It's terrible.
Please, please, please.
Tell him I'll get some from the 7-Eleven.
And if you need anything else, my name is, Butch.
Hang in there, Mork, you're doing okay.
Well, I owe it all to you, Mindy.
Thank you.
Ooh, will you look over there?
Look at that lobster!
Doesn't that look fabulous?
Oh, now I wish I'd ordered that.
: Yeah, me, too.
I wish we could have things like that.
I never have anything any good.
: Yeah, because you're so damn wimpy, that's why!
Why don't you get it for me?
All right, I'll get it for you!
Come on, we got to change this world No problem.
Excuse me!
You've been on top long enough!
Give me that, you bourgeoisie pigs!
Give me that here!
You won't need that thing.
Oh, look, what a way to end a honeymoon.
Poor little creatures.
Mork, I'm worried about you.
Unless you get these emotions under control, you're going to be scooped up by a net.
Well, Frankie Avalon didn't mind in all those movies where he was scooped up by Annette.
You know, it puzzles me I don't understand why you continue to view your emotions as if they're alien creatures.
They're a part of you, you know.
Haven't you ever just thought about sitting down and talking to them?
They wouldn't talk to me.
Well, do you think they'd talk to me?
Call them out and let me try.
Oh, you're a brave woman.
Are you sure?
All right.
Yoo-hoo, anybody home?
Olly, olly Freud's in free.
First one home is an archetype.
: Yeah, what do you want?
Now, I'm not going to know who you are unless you identify yourselves.
Anger, here, fly brain!
Mork just wants to try and get along with all of you better.
Why don't you just tell Mork to  Now, I don't know how things got the way they-they are on Ork, but here on Earth a person needs his emotions.
: Disappointment here.
Uh, I hate, I hate to bother you, but things, things aren't the way we thought, you know?
I mean, it's not like home.
I mean, the trees are green, the birds have wings, it's bizarre.
It really : Fear here.
Uh, I don't want to tell you this, but, you know, it's cold and lonely and no one likes us, and no one hears the voices like we do, and they're going to hurt us, I know they are.
Please, don't you understand me?
Oh, no, nobody's going to hurt you.
Don't you understand you're free on Earth.
You can do anything you want.
Disgust here.
Now, listen, we've done our gig and you don't even like it when we do.
Listen, I'm going to blow this Popsicle stand.
Besides, who wants to live in a house that looks like Sears blew up.
Really.
I mean : Hope here.
I just want to say Thanks for the memories.
But don't you see, Mork needs to work with all of you to be a feeling person.
Yeah, Mindy's right, you guys.
How about it?
I'll make you a deal.
Tell you what you don't go wild, and I won't lock you up inside my brain, okay?
Yeah, what's in it for us, pork face?
All right, you said you're lonely?
Oh, yes, please, we're so lonely.
You got to do something.
All right, I'll make you a deal.
Stick along with me, and I'll introduce you to Mindy's emotions.
All right, let's see what we're going to get out of this.
Stand up there sweet girl, let's check the noise out here.
Yeah looks like a good set of teeth.
All right we got that going.
Let's look Boy, who buys her clothes.
It's ridiculous.
Mindy, we'll be right back.
We'll get to you.
Huddle up over here now, boy!
Huddle up!
What do you think now?
Come on now, sit down!
I don't really understand why we're doing this.
Come on now, be quiet!
I don't understand.
It's not working out anyway.
Shut up!
Break!
Well?
I've got mixed emotions.
Some want to come out, and some don't.
Well, that sounds human enough.
What emotion are you feeling right now?
Gratitude.
Thank you, Mindy.
Oh, I like gratitude.
Here's one from Joy.
Oh, that was fantastic!
Thank you!
Whoo-hoo, hoo!
Here's one from Guilt, okay?
It's okay.
Oh, I'm going to burn for this, I know.
One from Envy.
Oh, how come I got to kiss you on the cheek and everybody else got to kiss you on the lips?
Boy.
One from Fear.
Oh, hope I didn't catch anything.
And here's one from all of us.
We I care for you very much.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
: Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson, Mork calling Orson.
You opened the door to your emotions, didn't you, Mork?
Yes, sir.
You realize you've broken the highest Orkan law.
It is my duty to report you to the Council.
I understand.
But I don't regret what I've done, sir.
You see, for the first time in my life I feel really alive, I feel fantastic.
Oh, I wish you could try it.
I wish you could feel some of the things I've been feeling.
Impossible.
I could never do that.
They'd throw me in prison.
I don't mean to be disrespectful, Your Immenseness, but, until you can marvel at a rainbow after a storm, or rejoice at seeing a baby walk for the first time, or hold someone, and feel the same warmth inside as you feel close to them on the outside, until you can do these things aren't you already in prison?
Uh, when will you report me, sir?
Report you?
What for?
Whew!
Ha!
You're all right, Your Fattitude!
Until next week, nanu-nanu.
I knew he had it in him.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Hello?
Are you dressed, honey?
Just my shorts, jockey.
Hi.
Oh, hello, dear.
Are you ready?
Well, I want you to know that I am not looking forward to this weekend.
Oh, I'm with you.
I'd rather have my nose pierced.
I agree, but it's an obligation.
Yeah, well, I haven't even told Mork yet.
I feel so bad about running off and leaving him stranded for the whole weekend.
It's a long way to Alpha Centauri  Yep.
It's me, the Doug Henning of the skycaps.
Let's go.
Let's take off.
Let's move it.
Come on now.
Hit the road, Jack Don't come back no more, no more.
Yeah, Mork, uh, Durango is a long, unpleasant drive from here.
Now you don't want to go there, do you?
My kind of town Durango is my No, no, Mork, no, it's a windy, twisty, carsicky trip.
You wouldn't like it.
Are you kidding?
I'll love it.
It's my first car trip here on Earth.
Please, you know, I stayed up all last night and look, I have my instamatic glove and I have a whole thumb load full of film.
Since I heard you were taking a trip to Durango last night I'm sorry I eavesdropped, but since Watergate, anything's free.
Look, I made plans.
I bought these silly clothes.
I even made a map.
See this.
Wait.
It's topographical and scratch-and-smell.
There's L.A. Whoo, bad news.
Over here look at this.
We'll start out from Boulder then we'll go a little bit out of the way to the Grand Canyon, : canyon, canyon We'll go over here to New York.
We'll spend autumn in New York.
Then we'll drive over to Paris, spend spring in Paris, watch the leaves change, then we'll go to Iran and watch the governments change.
Mork.
Shah, shah, Ayatollah you so.
Shah-shah Mork you can't go.
Do my eyes deceive my ears?
Wait, you must be pulling my krebits.
Mork, it's a family problem.
Uncle Jack is sick.
A drunken mime?
No, believe me, you don't want to go.
Uncle Jack is a little strange.
I've never liked him since he spit on me.
Why did he do that?
Well, it was years ago.
I had his tie.
What were you doing with his tie?
Well, I was pulling it, tighter and tighter.
I had him a lovely shade of purple.
He had it coming.
He was drunk.
Yeah.
See, it's a sickness and he wants to get better, so he checked himself into a hospital.
His wife asked us to come down and give him a little moral support.
Yeah, so now that we've explained, do you understand?
Hey, listen, you're talking to Mork the Compassionate.
I was almost a saint.
Tell you what, we'll leave out the Grand Canyon.
That way, we can be with Uncle Jack by Happy Hour.
Mork, you can't go.
Really, it's just a family matter.
Anyway, he'd be embarrassed to have a perfect stranger see him like this.
That's all right.
I'm a sensitive life-form.
I'm not some Venusian paramecium that was evolved yesterday, you know.
You'll be all right here alone for the weekend, won't you?
Sure, sure, why wouldn't I?
Well, you haven't been alone for any period of time since you've been here.
Hey, Mindy, let me lay out some hard, cold facts.
I'm the type of guy who's my own best friend.
I'm interesting, I'm amazing.
I can hold interesting conversations even with Tom Snyder.
Are you ever bored when you're alone with me?
No, but Neither am I. Same guy, same amazing personality.
I think what Mindy's trying to say is, when you get used to being around somebody, it's kind of difficult when they're gone.
Hey, we're not talking a lifetime, we're talking a weekend.
Two days.
Come on now, 48 hours.
Couple of thousand minutes, some seconds there.
Hey, you know, I know some Alpha Centurians that spend that much time just taking a coffee break.
Of course, they drink out of hundred-gallon mugs, but You know, I think we really should be going.
Good-bye, Mork.
Yeah, you kids get outta here.
Come on, before I kick you out.
Take a hike.
Come on, get out.
Well, then I'll see you Sunday night.
Ciao.
Have a fantastic time.
And, hey, don't worry about me, because I've got thousands of things to do.
I'm going to build that nuclear reactor for the hot tub you've been wanting for a long time.
Okay.
Take care.
All right, bye.
Bye.
I'm so stinking bored!
MORK : One more bottle of beer on the wall One more bottle of beer If one of those bottles should happen to fall One more time!
A million bottles of beer on the wall A million bottles of beer If one of those I can't sing that song anymore.
Ten times is enough.
I almost know it by heart.
Let's see how many points.
Ah, only two points against me.
Er She's only been gone 24 hours, and I'm going crazy.
What do you think?
Hey, don't look at me like that.
At least, you can do yoga.
What can I do?
Bickley's out of town.
Susan Taylor's visiting the Broncos.
Shazbot!
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha!
They can't fool me.
Wait, a cure, a remedy.
Wait, here we go.
Uh  Hello, Bob.
Oh, glad I caught you at home.
Hi.
How are you?
Great, great, good to hear that.
Bob, how's the little woman?
Fantastic, fantastic.
Hey, Bob, the reason I called What?
Mork.
No, no, no, you don't know me.
Yeah, I just picked your name out of the book.
Yeah, I thought with a name like Bob Lipschultz you've got to be a fun kind of guy.
Bob, how about you and I getting together?
What?
Bob?
Bad connection.
I guess it just hit me.
I didn't realize it till now that I'm a people junkie.
Need a conversation fix.
Can you spare a word, man?
"No, I can't".
Shut up, give me a chance.
I need a fix real bad.
I got to talk to someone.
I really do.
Yes, I do!
Talk to someone.
Is there anybody?
Is anybody out there?
Hey, you!
Yeah, changing the tire on the semi.
Yeah, with the tattoo on your face.
How are you?
Want to be my friend?
Hey, wait.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Don't!
Oh, an insurance salesman.
Whoa, nice throw!
You can get a job in front of any American Embassy in the world.
Hey, you two, what's all the noise?
Bicky, is that you?
Yeah, and I want the both of you to shut up.
No, no, no, wait!
Don't!
Mork, I want to talk to you.
Be right down.
Hey, big fella, you forgot your rock.
Here you go, catch.
Whoa, nice stop, right in the middle of tattoo.
Have a nice nap.
Come in.
Bicky.
Look at that.
Wow, parallel universe.
Same thing happened to me.
You pea-brain.
What's the big idea of getting that walking tree trunk mad at you?
I didn't mean to make him mad at me.
I just wanted to have a friend.
Mork, you're such a babe in the woods.
There are certain things you never do in this world if you want to stay in this world.
For example, never gargle with crazy glue.
: Never gargle with crazy glue.
Never tap-dance in a minefield.
All right.
No "Tea for Two" or  And never chide a man with a tattoo on his face even if he's dead.
No dead tattoos.
I didn't mean to.
It was just that I was bored and lonely.
Can't you think of a time when you were bored and lonely?
I can't think of a time when I wasn't bored.
No, I take that back.
I was once hit by lightning.
I wasn't bored when I was in a coma.
Oh, come on, things can't always be that bad.
Sure they can, kid.
When my wife and I got divorced, part of the settlement was that she got to keep our friends.
We'll make new friends for you.
Tell you what.
We'll go out tonight.
We'll have a swell time.
We'll paint the town pink.
And do what?
Well, we Oh, we can go to a movie.
Tell you what, we'll check the listings here and see what's playing.
Let's see.
Oh, here's a great double bill: Born Free and Women in Chains.
A movie?
Out of the question.
I never go any place where my feet stick to the floor.
All right.
Here are some self-improvement courses.
Let's see, there's a speed-reading course at the university from 8:00 to 8:05.
Forget it.
Wait!
Here's an ESP course.
Strange, it doesn't give the address.
Look, I don't want to go to any crummy movies or scuzzy meetings.
Well, let's see what Wait, wait, here's a wonderful thing.
This is a restaurant.
Let's see.
"Harry's Girls and Grill.
Topless, bottomless, backless, frontless".
Doesn't sound like they give you very much to eat.
I don't want to meet anybody and I don't want to go out.
Nothing you can say will make me change my mind.
Wait, wait.
Here's a great place.
"Mother Bell's.
Opens at 8:00".
It's just a bar.
First drink's free.
Meet me here at 7:30.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
I knew I shouldn't have come out tonight If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't have been in the car.
And if you hadn't seen that chipmunk, I never would have swerved to avoid it.
It was exciting, wasn't it?
Exciting?
You call taking off a parked car's door exciting?
It was for the sheriff sitting in the car.
Did you see the look on his face "What the"?
The silly fool was still trying to roll up the window and it was on its way to Cheyenne.
What was he doing in that car anyway?
He was escorting that big black limousine in front of him.
Oh, the one we crashed into.
Yeah, the same.
Well, it's not your fault.
Listen, you swerved to avoid that squirrel.
You tell that to any judge in the country, and he'll believe you.
: Oh, really?
What makes you think the judge would take my word over the governor's?
Ah, good point.
There's a yin and yang to everything.
Here's the yin: if that car hadn't been there, we would have gone over the cliff.
The yang was the governor's car went over the cliff.
Boy, was he mad.
Well, not as mad as if he'd been in the car.
Excuse me.
Are you boys new?
No, actually he's about 45, 46; I'm kind of ageless.
She means is this our first time here.
The answer is yes.
Well, it's Mother Bell's policy to buy new customers their first drink.
Paper parasols?
I didn't know we were in Little Tokyo.
There's no theater like an old theater I don't want any fruity drinks.
Bring me a bourbon and water, and hold the water.
Well, bring me a Shirley Temple, and hold the curls; I don't want a hair ball.
Excuse me, miss, uh, tell me, what are these telephones for?
They're all over the place.
To call people.
You can call anyone in this room.
This is a very friendly place.
See?
I told you.
Don't I pick good places, huh?
Didn't I do well, right?
You bubblehead!
This isn't just a bar; it's a pickup joint.
A what?
Oh.
Pick up the phone.
Hello.
Well, I don't think I have one of those.
Maybe my friend does.
Well, if that was true, I'd have to be eight feet tall.
Give me that.
Don't you realize this is a swinging singles bar?
And that kicks it, I'm going home.
No, wait!
Come on, Bick.
It's time to flick.
Let's go!
Listen, come on, Bickley, you said you wanted to come here because you were lonely and bored, and look at all these people.
They must've come here 'cause they were lonely and bored.
Mork, you don't understand.
I've never felt comfortable meeting people.
I never could do it.
I always felt as though I was in over my head, and right now, I feel very uncomfortable, and I'd like to go home.
Hi.
Would you boys mind if we joined you?
You know, I never did get my bourbon.
I'm Lisa, and this is Penny.
Hi.
Oh, a Penny for my thoughts.
Heads or tails.
Just watch those thoughts because this is my daughter.
Mother and da-da- daw-daw-daw-daw a little kid.
Yeah.
Well, the family that plays together stays together.
Oh.
It's not like that at all.
Look, Mom just got into town, and I wanted to take her out, so we came here.
I had no idea this was a a swinger's bar.
No.
And, you see, what's happened is that there are two fellas over there, and they've been, um, well, you know, looking at us.
Oh, you mean those two guys that look like the history of leather.
Well put.
Look, we figured I mean, if you fellas wouldn't mind that we'd pretend that you were our dates so they'd leave us alone.
Is that okay?
Well, sure, um, I guess so.
My name is Mork.
Nana-nanu.
And this is Bickley.
Bickley, would you like them to be our dates?
: Absowubely.
Ahb dowms Uh, uh, uh, bourbon!
Uh well, uh, do you fellas come here very often?
No, this is our first time.
We're just kind of bored and lonely guys looking for meaningful life in this existence.
But now you've given us some meaning, and Bickley, is this what Earth's all about?
No.
No.
This is our first time here.
Uh what's your sign?
Ah, Nefarious, with egg rising.
And, uh, where do you live?
Oh, right here in Boulder.
Libra.
I'm a Libra.
Libra.
I can't believe this is happening.
Neither can I. If the fruity drink lady comes by again, would you like us to get you something?
Oh, thanks, but we've imposed enough.
Boulder.
I live in Boulder.
This is great!
Just great!
Listen, um you know those two fellas um, they're staring at us again.
Whoa.
Bang-bang.
Uh, those guys give me the creeps.
Look, why don't we go somewhere else, and we'll buy you guys a drink.
Good idea.
Hey, that sounds fantastic.
Anything not to be bored and lonely again.
Whoa, thank you.
Hey, why don't we buy you two girls a drink?
Waitress, could we have those two freebie drinks back again?
You know, the fruit- and-umbrella numbers?
Boy, you can't believe what we fell into here.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Uh Scratch that.
My greedy neighbor just ran off with my mother and daughter.
Keep it.
Bick, Bick, what's keeping you?
Come on, you got to get going.
The girls are ready to go, and you'll never guess what happened.
They want to take us to a house.
You'll never guess whose house.
Not theirs?
Close.
Yours!
Oh!
Let's go.
Oh!
Will you look at this.
Now, isn't this nice.
Yes, it's darling.
See?
Isn't it nice to have friends over?
It's wonderful!
See, Mr. Bickley's not used to having people over.
Well, he's kind of a grouch, but we're trying to help him through it.
Yeah, last February I almost grinned.
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha.
Whoa Well, now that we're here, let's get down to a really good game of Parcheesi.
Would you mind if we powder our nose first?
Oh, gladly, but just don't use gunpowder or you'll visit your head in Utah.
Thanks for the advice.
Where is it?
It's right through there, just across from the bedroom.
Fine.
Thank you.
Come on, honey.
Yeah, that yeah, right Oh, Mork, this is impossible to believe.
Never in my entire life have I ever picked up a girl before.
I was always afraid to try.
But, you know, it's not so hard once you give it a try.
All it takes is a little self-assertion.
'Cause, if you got it, you got it.
You got it, and we want it.
What was it?
What is it?
A stickup.
All right, Oh come on, everybody up, up, up.
Hands up in the air.
I don't want to have to scatter you all around the room.
Can't you point that thing the other way?
No.
It wouldn't have the same impact.
Now, come on, empty your pockets on the table.
Come on.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Matchmaker!
Well, at least we're not bored anymore.
Miss, I hope you don't think I'm rude, but I think your mother's teaching you some bad habits.
Yeah, well, just think of it as charity.
I'd hardly ever donate my watch to charity.
Okay, come on, that's Mark with the car.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Okay.
Well, that should slow you down for a little while.
Uh, thank you.
It's been nice robbing you.
Yeah, thanks for the date.
It's been fun.
Shouldn't we have kissed them good night?
They were so cute.
Well Thanks a lot, Officer.
I know you'll find them.
Ciao.
Oh, come on, Bick.
We'll get our stuff back.
Those girls robbed three other guys in the same bar, and the police are gonna have a cookout.
Stakeout.
Oh.
I don't mind talking to a policeman for an hour this time of night, but I resent his shaking his head and giggling the whole time.
Come on, it's a new wave silly cops.
Haven't you watched CHiPs?
Hi.
How's Uncle Jack?
Oh, I think he'll be all right.
He just had a cork stuck in his throat.
How was your weekend?
Why do you ask?
Well, to be perfectly honest with you, I thought that since I was gone you'd run out of things to do and be bored.
Oh, me?
Good-time Morky bored?
We had a fantastic time.
Bicky, tell her if you've got any strength left after our wild and wonderful weekend.
He didn't let up all weekend.
Oh, we had a wonderful time.
In fact, our company just left.
What company?
Um, uh, Mork and I met a couple of girls.
Yeah, we went to a gymnastics bar.
It was incredible.
And we met these wonderful friends.
We'll take you there, and you can make friends, too.
How friendly were these friends?
Do we look like the kind of guys who would kiss and tell?
Mindy, you should've seen the mother.
So beautiful.
Mother?
!
I don't think I want to hear about this.
Then I can tell you about the daughter.
You wanna hear about that, huh, maybe?
I know I don't want to hear this.
I'm a little tired.
I think I'm gonna go to bed.
I'll talk to you about this tomorrow.
Good night, Mr. Bickley.
Good night, Mr. Goodbar.
But wait!
Mindy!
You'll never guess who we ran into the governor.
Whew!
Wow.
You know something, Bicky?
When we were going through it tonight, it was it was kind of terrifying, but telling Mindy right now, it sounded really good to me.
Yeah, I agree.
Maybe from a distance, we can appreciate what we've experienced better rather than when we were actually going through the trauma of having No, that's bull.
Yeah, I guess people forget the fun things and only remember the exciting things.
We weren't bored, so we must've accomplished what we wanted to do.
Yeah.
Wish they hadn't robbed us, though.
We sure have a heck of a story to tell our grandkids.
Well, good night, Mork.
Good night, Bick.
Mork, I was thinking Saturday night?
Be there or be square!
There are millions of stories on this planet.
This has just been one of them.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, the Incredible Bulk.
Mork calling Orson.
Did you have an interesting week, Mork?
Oh, yes, sir, I met some people called "thieves".
Thieves?
What are thieves?
Well, thieves are people who steal things.
First of all, there are jewel thieves, who steal precious gems and stones, there are cat burglars, who steal pets, and then the Pittsburgh Steelers, who steal entire cities.
Don't tell me Boulder, Colorado, got taken.
Oh, no, sir, just me and Mr. Bickley.
We were robbed by some lady friends that Bickley said we never should've trusted to begin with.
I thought earthlings believed in trust.
Even that dollar bill you sent me had "In God We Trust" written on it.
Orson, you can't believe everything you read.
It also said that it's worth a dollar.
Let me understand.
You were robbed by two friends?
Yes, sir.
Ooh, they were pretty and soft.
Well soft on the outside, and kind of hard on the inside.
You mean, on Earth, your friends will rob you?
Well, if they do, they're not really friends, then.
Well, Mindy's your friend.
How do you know that someday she won't rob you?
Well, sir, I don't think she's that kind of friend, and even if she were, she'd have to rob me thousands of times just to get back half of what she's given me.
So until next week.
Give me an "N"!
"N".
Give me an "A"!
"A".
Give me another "N"!
"N".
Give me a big "O"!
"O".
What's that spell?
Nanu.
Wrong.
Nano.
See you next week, Orsoon.
Nanu!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
What a chump!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Okay left foot on the blue dot.
Look out!
Oh what happened?
I'm sorry.
And Mork I'm sorry I sat on your face.
That's all right, Julius.
I do it all the time.
Okay?
Great.
Thanks.
Are you all right?
Sure.
I love to play "Squash the Alien".
Oh.
Could you breathe down there?
Only out.
Well, I'm sorry all those people fell on you, Mork.
Oh, that's a great game.
Let's play another game like, "Musical Spikes" or "Hide and Go Kill".
Ah, Why don't you just come out and say you don't want to play this silly game.
I didn't want to be rude.
Come on in.
Okay, I'll spin again.
Please don't get up.
They didn't come in that way, did they?
That's obscene.
It looks like a Christmas card from Hugh Hefner.
It's just a game.
See, they're not supposed to fall over.
Oh?
Left hand to blue  Mr. Bickley, you can't just come in here and start shoving my guests around.
You should at least ask first.
Do you know what that sounds like downstairs?
Like R2-D2 trying to do a soft-shoe.
Oh, come on.
We just started playing this game.
And what trouble-maker is sucking ice into his mouth and spitting it back into an empty glass?
Oh, sorry.
And stop putting ice cubes in your drinks.
You know what it's like being under 13 people all tinkling at once.
I guess we'll have to try and be more quiet.
Tell you what we'll only play "spin the sock", and we'll replace our stereo needle with a Q-tip and we'll only play charades wearing gloves.
Shut up!
Thank you.
Look, Mr. Bickley look, I have just about had it  Hey, don't try to get cozy with me, sweetie pie.
I'm steamed.
And when I'm steamed, it's no more Mr. Wonderful.
I have my rights and I'm not leaving here until there's no more dancing, singing, laughing, talking or bodily sounds.
Oh, sorry.
Look at that, it's 8:30 already.
Well, we better be going Wait a minute you guys.
Don't let him scare you off.
See you later.
Oh, really Come on, Julius I'm sorry, Mindy.
I have to go.
I have a self-assertion class.
I'm afraid if I'm late, they'll kill me.
Come on, Julius.
We'll get together again real soon.
Over my dead body.
Hey, that's a great game.
It takes a long time to play though and gets kind of gross near the end.
Well, I hope you're happy.
Everyone's gone.
When it comes to parties, I'm the super pooper.
Mr. Bickley, you are the worst you are the most unreasonable Don't forget cantankerous.
That's on my business cards.
Hey, what's this?
A transistor noise-maker?
No, no, no, no, see that's a radio for deaf mutes.
See?
I love you more than you'll ever know Turn it down.
: I love you more than you'll ever know I know what it is, Mr. Wiseacre.
It's a pocket calculator.
Big deal!
Well, this is an incredibly boring party.
You know, it's funny.
When you're actually up here, it's not so noisy.
Whew, boy, am I glad he didn't start pushing any buttons on this Age Machine.
Why?
I think it would be funny seeing Bickley acting like a little kid.
Except, he'd probably tell his mother to put a muffler on his rattle.
That's impossible.
You see, only Orkans are affected by the Age Machine.
No matter who presses these buttons, I'm the one who goes through the changes.
Well then, you'd better put that in a safe place.
Yeah, you're right.
I sat on it once and became two ages at once.
That must've been terrible.
Yeah, I became a Boy Scout and an octogenarian at the same time.
I spent days helping myself across the street.
Dad, Grandma, has anybody seen my Mindy necklace?
Well, I don't think it's here anywhere, honey.
Did you lose it?
Well, I-I took it off at my party last night and when we were cleaning up, I couldn't find it.
It's my theory that it was sucked into a parallel universe.
The same universe that socks go when you lose them in the dryer.
I bet that Jimmy Hoffa is wearing it right now.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I have a luncheon date.
And I must go and spray myself with Charlie .
You know, I'd hate to think that somebody took it.
It was just a cheap necklace.
I don't know why anybody would want it.
All right, let's use our powers of deductive reasoning.
Whoever took it had to be named "Mindy".
Now who at the party was named Mindy?
All right, up against the wall, sister!
Move it!
Move it!
Move it!
Come on.
This is serious.
Why would I take my own necklace?
The insurance?
Why don't you call up everybody who was at the party and ask if they're a despicable thief?
Boy, I hate to think it was taken by a friend.
Hey, I've got an idea.
I'll tell you what.
We'll go to Jamaica, get a gris-gris man, put de voodoo on it, man, wait till his arms fall off, then we know, man.
We got him hands down, boys.
Hello, Debbie Wilson?
Yes, this is Mork.
I'm a friend of Mindy's.
Well, any friend of Mindy's is a friend of mine, too.
Listen, did you steal Mindy's necklace?
What?
I don't know what that has to do with anything, but yes, I can blow it out my ear.
No, I'm sorry, not raw.
Okay.
Oh!
Some friend!
Hi.
Guess what I got us for dinner.
I got us some spare ribs.
Did you find my necklace?
: No, because I'm still playing detective.
Listen, sweetheart, if you'd like to be my assistant, how about your going in the bedroom and slipping on that flimsy negligee I got for you.
Okay, Sherlock, when you find out who dunnit, you let me know.
I found out who didn't done it.
I phoned everyone in your class and accused them.
You what?
Yes.
When I ran out of that, I had to widen the search.
I used this book of mug shots here.
Those aren't mug shots.
That's my high school yearbook.
Oh, yeah?
What about this one?
Linda Birchey.
She received the Catharine The Great Award from the 4-H Club, was voted "loosest and most likely to succeed".
Mork, that girl isn't a criminal.
She's a cheerleader.
Oh, that explains when she told me to drop dead, she spelled out: Give me a "D," give me an "R," give me an "O".
Wait a minute.
You talked to her?
Oh, yeah.
I called everybody in this book.
And by the way, Molly Berger says hello and she'd like to push your face in a Cuisinart.
I can't believe you called all my friends.
I can't believe what they called you.
Oh, Mork, how could you do this to me?
Do this to you?
I'm the one that had to take the abuse and the threats.
Threats?
Yes, but don't worry.
No one's going to burn down this house as long as I'm alive.
Oh, Mork!
Wow!
I didn't know we had one of these!
Oh, I forgot.
You haven't seen one of those before, have you?
Are you kidding?
I know how to use this.
Watch this, mama.
Meadowlark, check this action.
I'm goin' in for a slam dunk.
Ta-da!
Oh, no, I didn't know it was with litter.
That was our dessert.
Oh, heavy melon-choly.
No, it might be the Fruit Police!
Don't worry.
I'll answer the door.
We have to be cautious about this.
Are you expecting a zipper?
You have some nerve, McConnell.
She's also got a great set of frontal lobes, too.
I can't work with all this noise.
Sorry about that.
That won't happen again, will it, Wilt?
Not until we grow another ball.
It better not.
I've been stuck on the same verse for hours.
Why didn't you come to me for help?
Listen, what are neighbors for?
I was tops in my poetry class.
Listen to this.
There was a young fweeble from glerm, whose foboes were stuck in her blerm.
As she plimmeled her quaft and said with a twaft Excuse me.
That's good.
It's filthy, but it's good.
I knew you'd like it.
Hey, that's an idea.
I'll change my verse to a limerick.
Gee, thanks.
Thanks a lot.
That's terrific.
Thank you.
And no more noise up here!
And now I've got to decide whether to move to another city or apologize personally to my entire graduating class.
I'm sorry, Mindy.
I was just trying to solve the case.
Oh, I know, Mork.
Your heart was in the right place.
Yeah, it's still there.
Hey, wait a minute, the ribs are gone.
No, if they were gone, I couldn't breathe.
I'd just blow up like No, no.
They were here a minute ago and now they're gone.
All right, then let me retrace my steps.
I was right here.
And Bickley was right here and now Bickley and the ribs are gone.
Well, who'd want to steal Bickley?
No, Mork, Bickley stole the ribs.
Why would he want to do that?
I don't know.
But he was at the party last night, too.
Aha.
And he had access to your pork.
I don't understand it, but he must have done it.
All right, let's put the clues together.
First the necklace.
Now Grand Theft, pork.
That proves he's not Kosher.
All right.
Shazbot!
What?
He stole my Orkan Age Machine.
Oh, no, that could be terrible.
He doesn't know what he has.
And if he starts pressing those buttons  Oh, it's okay, Mork.
He's gotta press another button soon I hope.
Whew.
I'm back.
I'm glad he didn't keep me there too long, because at that age I wasn't housebroken.
He must've taken your Age Machine because he thought it was a calculator.
Yeah, I just hope he doesn't try to balance his checkbook tonight, or I could be doing squats with Sitting Bull.
I just can't believe.
: Whew!
All right, hon, that was a wonderful TV dinner.
Thanks, not tonight, though, I have a headache.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Tell you what.
Let's pack the kids in the car, we'll have a martini, then we'll go to the PTA meeting.
We'll raise the flag.
Oh, no!
Oh-oh, I can't believe what he's doing.
He set it for "Middle-Age".
I didn't even know I had an attachment for "Middle America".
We'd better stop him before he sets it for "Old Age" or even worse, "Cadaver".
"Cadaver"?
You mean, like in corpse?
Oh, yeah, you should try it sometime.
You always said you wanted to see if your nails could be longer.
This is serious.
Maybe Mr. Bickley has kleptomania.
What's that?
Well, a kleptomaniac is a person that steals compulsively.
Oh, like politicians.
: Hey, Betty Lou, come on.
Let's go down to the lake and listen to my voice change.
Come on.
Let's go  Look cooties, cooties!
Da-da-da-da-da!
Nyah-nyah-yah nyah-nyah-yah!
Whoa!
He must be doing long division now!
We've got to stop him before he does square roots and sends me all the way back along my evolutionary track.
You mean, all the way back to the ape?
Oh, no.
You see, on Ork there were no apes.
We evolved from    Mork!
Is that you?
Does this live here?
Uh yes, he does, Officer.
His name is Mork.
Mork?
I thought it was Henny Penny.
I found him acting like a chicken and running back and forth across the highway.
Mork, why were you crossing the road?
I think I was evolving a joke.
I had this strange urge to get to the other side.
He didn't do anything wrong, did he?
We almost took him in on a 602: Pecking an Officer.
Yeah, my nose is killing me.
What, uh, happened to your clothes?
I was molting.
That's why that's why I put that bag on him.
Well, thanks for bringing him home.
Is this some kind of fraternity prank?
No, I'm just weird.
Yeah!
That's what it is.
It's a fraternity prank.
Shake the officer's hand, Mork.
Nanu-nanu.
Oh!
Sigma-Delta-Phi!
I'm Alpha-Nu.
You know Iggy-diggy.
See you around the campus, buddy.
My kind of guy.
Are you all right?
Yeah, now I am.
But he sent me all the way back to cave-chicken.
It was really a drag building fires, trying to hatch everything I could find.
You didn't have a baby in the last half hour, did you?
No, I don't think so.
Phew!
I'm glad I didn't do that fertility dance barefooted, then.
What's in the bag?
Oh, the usual seeds, corn one egg I tried to hatch.
Phew!
What a drag that was.
And this this came off a woman I was dragging to build a nest.
The good parts got away, though.
Well, at least you're back to normal now.
Yeah, but that's just for the moment.
Who knows?
If he starts using that machine again, I could be a gleam in some Cro-Magnon rooster's eye.
Well, Mork, the only way to handle the situation is we're just going to have to confront Bickley, and tell him to give us our stuff back.
You're right.
I'm with you, Mama.
Let's go.
We're going to make that rat squeal.
We're gonna make him let the cat out of the bag and let the beans fall now!
Come on, let's go!
Let's go.
Hey, don't you think you ought to change first?
I guess you're right.
It's kind of hard to look macho in a green plastic dress.
Come on, Mr. Bickley, open up.
Yoo-hoo, sticky fingers!
It's all right.
He's not here.
Let's go.
Come on.
We'd better not.
Come on, Mindy.
We've got to get that Age Machine back.
Yeah, but Mork, it's against the law to go into somebody's apartment when they're not home, even if the door is unlocked.
Oh, can you honestly say that, since Watergate?
Let's go.
Yeah, but we could get in trouble!
No, come on!
Look, Bickley's working on a new greeting card.
Let's see this "To a brave and fearless hunter, "whose face is really red.
"You thought you winged a turkey, but it was your brother's head".
Boy, he's got one for every occasion.
Look, here's your Age Machine.
Ah!
Let's see if it's still working.
I'll set it for "One Second Ago".
I'll set it for "One Second Ago".
I'll set it for "One Second Ago".
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you Ah!
That thing is dangerous.
Look!
There's my Mindy necklace.
Ha!
All the evidence is in.
Necklace meat and this Obviously, we're dealing with a carnivorous transvestite with an age hang-up.
"M" is for the million things she gave me He's coming!
"O" means only that she's growing old What do we do?
Mallard!
Mallard!
What?
Duck!
"R" means right And right means ever true Put them all together, they spell "Mother" And that's what I will always be to you.
Come on, sing along.
You can do it.
Come on.
"M" is for the million things she gave Uh-oh.
Running a little low.
I'd better get back to the old friendly skies.
I've got a surprise for you.
That's why I made you wear a blindfold in the Doggie Department.
Look, isn't it cute?
Your own little fire hydrant.
With your own little magazine rack.
Oh, and here's a treat to make your teeth grow in big and strong and sharp.
Make the mailman earn that last raise we had to give him.
Oh, woodgie-woodgie!
Oh!
Bicky, you and I are so much alike, except for the hair and the ears and the tail and the fleas.
Hope I didn't give you any.
You're the only true friend I have.
You know I sometimes feel you're like a son to me a sweet little boy.
I-I wonder, if you could talk, what you would say to me.
: You're a thief, Pop Well, that hurts, Bicky.
That rea Wait a minute.
Dogs can't talk.
There must be another animal in here!
Come on out!
Come on!
Hi!
No shoot, G.I., no shoot.
Hey, what are you two doing here?
Uh Hey, this is trespassing.
Well, uh You're breaking and entering.
You're thieves!
Burglars!
Oh, no, it's not like that.
See Well, I'm sure there is a very reasonable explanation why you are in my apartment.
All right, let's hear it.
Yes.
As a matter of fact, there is a reason why we're in your apartment.
We came here to get the stuff back that you stole from us.
Prove it.
Do you think I'd take the word of a couple of burglars?
Aw, come on, Bickley.
Cut the canine residue, and let's get to it.
Why'd you do it?
You're so fond of those stupid party games.
Why don't you guess?
All right.
You're a kleptomaniac.
Wrong!
Want some dip?
Oh, thank you.
You did it for the money?
No!
Want a cocktail weenie?
How do you get money for fencing pork ribs?
I've got it!
You horrible man!
You're building a Frankenpig.
Not even close.
You want a soft drink?
Oh, thank you.
Don't thank me.
They're yours.
Oh, for a thief, you're awfully gracious.
Thank you.
Anyone want to dance?
Mr. Bickley, this is not a party.
Well, not with everybody standing around like this.
Mr. Bickley, did you take our things so that we'd come down here to talk to you?
Hogwash!
Why would I want to see you?
You didn't invite me to your party.
Whoa, you mean you really wanted to come?
I would have gladly slipped a disc to play that stupid game.
As it was, I had to come down here and play it with Bicky.
You really love that ball of fur we gave you, don't you?
My wife and I tried for years, but we couldn't have one of our own.
Ooh, heavy sigh.
A dogless couple.
I didn't know you were married.
I lost her in 1966.
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Every night I pray the old bat doesn't find me.
She didn't like me, either.
You know, Mr. Bickley, to have friends, you've got to be nice, too.
There's always a price.
That's what I like about Bicky.
I don't have to do anything to make him like me.
Oh, now, wait a minute.
I see you walking him all the time.
Yeah, and I see you feeding him and talking to him and scooping up after him.
That's a lot of work.
Well, it's worth it.
He's never said an unkind word to me.
Well, what the point is, is that it's not that hard to be nice.
Yeah, and it was a lot of work to steal all this stuff just so we'd come down and visit you.
Stealing wasn't all that much work, especially when it's from someone you really care about.
Oh, Mr. Bickley, I'm sorry you think we slighted you.
There.
Listen, from now on, we're going to be the best of friends, okay?
Yeah, and if we ever find anything missing again, I promise we'll come to you first.
Aw, that's really nice.
Look I'm not used to this sentimental garbage.
I'll have to take a little of this swill at a time.
Come on, get out of here, you guys.
Come on.
Hit the road.
That's it.
Come on!
Vamoose, amscray.
That's it for the night.
Come on.
We want to be alone.
And if you find anything of yours missing, come by our place and come look for it, okay?
Around dinner time.
And don't play that stolen radio all night!
Some watchdog you are!
Come on, you want to have a party?
Mork calling Orson come in, Orson Mork calling Orson come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Everything all right, Orson?
Yes, this better be good, Mork.
You got me out of the shower.
Oh, please don't shake yourself dry this time, Your Immenseness.
Last time, it rained for weeks.
Get on with it, Mork, while I look for a towel.
Oh, don't tarry, sir.
The report, Mork!
Sir!
This week, I discovered a terrible Earth disease called "loneliness".
Do many people on Earth suffer from this illness?
Oh, yes, sir.
And how they suffer!
One man I know suffers so much, that he has to take a medication called "bourbon".
Even that doesn't help very much, because he can hear paint dry.
Does bed rest help?
No, because I've heard that sleeping alone is part of the problem.
You see, Orson, loneliness is a disease of the spirit.
And people who have it think that no one cares about them.
Do you have any idea why?
Yes, sir.
You can count on me.
You see, when children are young, they're told not to talk to strangers.
And when they go to school, they're told not to talk to the person next to them.
And finally, when they get to be very old, they're told not to talk to themselves.
Who's left?
Are you saying that Earthlings make each other lonely?
No, sir, I'm saying just the opposite that they make themselves lonely.
They're so busy looking out for number one, they don't have room for two.
It's too bad everybody down there can't get together and find a cure.
Well, here's the paradox, sir.
Because if they did get together, they wouldn't need one.
Isn't that Zenlike?
One hand clapping Until next week nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Orson calling Mork.
Come in, Mork.
Orson calling Mork.
Come in, Mork.
Mork, activate your receiver mode and come in, please.
Orson, you never call me.
What's up, sweetheart, darling, baby?
I have something very important to tell you, Mork.
Oh, don't tell me you've got some heavy news.
Mork, I'm calling to tell you you're about to have a birthday.
Uh-oh.
My first?
Now don't panic.
Everything will be just fine if you do what I say.
Why'd it have to happen to me?
Couldn't someone else have had my first birthday?
Calm down!
Thanks.
I needed that.
Every Orkan has to go through this.
Mork, meet your gleek.
Gleek?
Now, on your birthday, you'll begin to run down.
You'll speed up, you'll slow down.
You'll have trouble talking.
You'll act weird uh, uh, excuse me.
You'll act weirder.
Don't shake the gleek!
You'll deactivate the chemicals.
Sorry, Your Fattitude.
That gleek must be in perfect working order when you hit it against your head to recharge yourself.
No problem, Your Immenseness.
I'll guard it as if my life depended on it.
Mork, your life does depend on it.
Whew!
No pressure.
Well, sir, I've got to be going.
I've got a new job at a place called a kennel.
It's populated with creatures just like Venusians, only smarter.
Lucky you speak Venusian.
Ah, you bet.
I just can't believe it.
It's so good to see you again.
I know.
Three months is too long for friends like us to be apart.
Did you know that if we were snails, we'd already be dead?
So much has happened, Joyce.
Yeah.
Like my name isn't Joyce anymore.
It's Rainbow.
Do you want some coffee?
No, I never drink caffeine.
Oh, well, how 'bout a soft drink?
Mindy, sugar is suicide.
Can you drink water?
It's got fluorides in it.
Well, what can you drink?
Do you have a beer?
Doesn't beer have chemicals in it, too?
Yeah, but after a six-pack, who cares?
Good point.
Mindy.
Oh, Mork.
Oh.
Hi, other person.
Mork, I want you to meet my good friend, Rainbow.
Rainbow, this is Mork.
Oh, and double it.
Nanu-nanu.
I like him already.
You know, I get so tired of that hippie handshake, you know, and those people who keep saying the same boring clichÃ©s.
So, by the way, what's your sign?
I think Mork's a moon child.
Oh, come on, Mindy, you know moon children are only this big with mold on their heads and terrible acne.
Oh, how'd your first day at the kennel go?
Oh I don't know why they call it work, it was so easy.
They told me to take the dogs for a walk, and I could see they could walk by themselves, so I let them out.
I told them to be back by midnight.
Mork, they'll never come back.
Oh, yes, they will.
They promised.
Well, Mork, you might as well not go back to work at the kennel tomorrow.
He's been having a hard time finding a job.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Well, you know, I run a health food store, and I've been looking for a revolutionary moon child stock boy.
How would you like to try it?
Whoa.
Does a Martian have eight legs?
Whoa.
I still respect you.
Ah, none for you until you finish that bologna sandwich I gave you the other day.
When I think of all the starving plants in Asia.
What?
You don't eat meat?
Oh, you're a humanitarian.
What?
Then I'll fix you a salad next time.
Oh, sorry.
Might be somebody you know.
Shh.
Shh.
There's the phone.
Shut up!
I know what it was!
Give me a chance!
I don't know who that is.
Get him off.
Whew!
I'm okay.
I'll get it.
Everybody off!
Everybody off!
Hello.
Good-bye, hello, good-bye.
Jive turkey.
I know.
I need my recharge.
I need my gleek.
Gleek, gleek.
Ah.
Whew!
Oh, my little gleek.
Gleek, don't fail me now.
What's wrong, are you dumb?
Hmm?
No, it's not time to recharge yet.
I've got two more hours.
I'd better set my watch.
Ankle watch, set, set.
Ankle watch still ticking.
Gleek, I can't let you out of my sight today.
If I do, I'd be up the Milky Way without a paddle.
Mindy, get the phone.
I told her.
Be quiet!
Hello?
There's nobody there.
Same thing happened to me.
Phone again.
Shut up!
I heard it!
Get at the phone.
I will!
Listen, dirtball, I've had it up to here with you.
Oh, yeah?
to you, too.
Mork, will you stop kidding around?
What's that?
It's a rope.
What's it for?
Well, it serves a very important purpose.
I can't remember what for, though.
Are you all right?
I think so.
I had trouble sleeping last night.
I tossed and turned, which is not very easy, considering I sleep hanging from a bar.
Well, if you're tired, why don't you go crash for a while?
I'm not into pain, but I think a nap will do.
Mindy!
What?
Mindy, I remember what the rope is for!
Oh.
It's an old Orkan custom.
You see, when we want to remember something, we tie a rope around our neck.
Oh, we do the same thing, except we tie a little string around our finger.
Oh, on Ork, that's how we used to hang cattle rustlers.
Well, terrific.
Now, what were you supposed to remember?
Mm I can't remember.
I forget.
I I bet I know.
What?
Today's your interview at the Vitamin Vendor.
Oh, thank you.
Now I don't have to get ring around the rope.
That's something very important.
Thank you for reminding me.
I know it's important to you, so good luck.
Mork, don't do tricks like that at your interview.
I'll see you later.
You can count on me.
Ciao.
Whoa.
Something's wrong.
I  Wait a minute.
Either I'm sick, or I'm in Pisa.
I'm all right now.
Hold on, I must be sick.
Let me see.
No fever.
Wish I could remember what I'm supposed to do.
Play back old tape.
Plants.
Head back to plants.
Plants are the clue.
You still haven't eaten that bologna sandwich I gave you earlier.
Now, you've got to eat so you can grow up and be big and strong like your father, Fern.
Wait!
Food!
Food.
Gleek.
Gleek!
Ah, thanks.
Oh, good for you.
Oh, if I forgot my gleek, that'd be a disaster if I fail to recharge myself.
If I don't recharge, I might slow down, I speed up, my memory goes.
I slow down, I speed up, my memory goes.
Wow, dÃ©jÃ  vu.
I feel like I've been here before.
I wish I could remember what I'm supposed to do.
God, I got to remember.
What am I talking about?
I don't know.
Give me a chance.
You signed the contract.
Ha, ha, ha.
You're not going to get me with that old phone trick.
Come in.
Thank you.
Thanks.
My violin sounds a lot better now, Mrs. Hudson.
Well, I knew it would once I shook your pet turtle out of it.
Well, the lesson's over, and I'm going to lunch.
Oh, enjoy it.
Where you going to go?
That new continental cafe.
Oh, Chez Eddie?
Is that place any good?
Of course.
All the French truck drivers eat there.
Well, I guess I have to hang around here.
My mom doesn't pick me up for another hour.
Really?
Well, I'll give you a ride home.
Okay, on one condition.
This time, you don't pop any wheelies.
So long, folks.
Okay, have a nice lunch, Gram.
Your grandmother is always out to lunch.
Mork, what are you doing here?
I thought I had an interview.
You do, at the Vitamin Vendor.
I don't feel too well, especially when I left the house.
I Well, you look fine now.
Well, it comes and goes.
Are you all right?
Oh, certainly I'm all right.
Pull!
Daddy, I think he might need a doctor.
Uh, he's asleep standing on his feet.
Is that normal for him?
Not at all.
Normally, he sleeps hanging from a bar.
Charley, I could've been a contender.
Feelin' good now Punchin' meat now Suckin' eggs now.
You know something?
I think you're right.
I-I'm going to go get that doctor.
He's out here in the mall.
I'll be right back.
Good.
Mork?
Huh, what?
Whoa, who took my bones?
Oh, your foot's ringing.
I'll get it.
Don't answer it.
They'll just hang up.
It's your ankle-watch.
What's this piece of paper?
Must be a footnote.
It says, "Dear Mork, just a reminder.
"If you don't use your gleek, "you'll be dead in one hour.
Love Mork".
Whoa.
Oh!
Mork, what's a gleek?
I don't know.
Well, what did you mean when you said you were going to be dead in one hour?
I don't know.
I heard that somewhere, though.
In that note.
Why did you write that note?
What note?
Oh.
This note.
Look, it's in your own handwriting.
I'm going to be dead.
Oh, I miss me.
Oh, no, I'm gonna die.
Heavy sigh.
Anxiety.
Anger mixed with inner turmoil.
Oh no, I'm seeing my whole life flash before me.
No big deal.
I've got so much to do.
There's only an hour left.
Wait.
Wait.
At last, a cure for acne.
I'd like to thank the Academy.
No one helped me get this award.
I Mork, what are you doing?
I've only got an hour left, Mindy, and I I want to reach for all the gusto I can.
Oh.
Mork, oh.
Oh, if only there were an hour and ten minutes.
Oh.
Mindy, what are you doing after the funeral?
Oh, Mork, stop.
No, don't stop me now.
I'm full of real zest for life!
Oh.
Listen, sit down.
Daddy went just across the mall.
He's getting a doctor, so Why, is he sick?
No, you're sick.
Oh, I can't be.
I've got to go to that interview.
Forget that interview.
Forget what?
Here he is.
Oh, good.
Hi, there.
I'm Dr. Ducky.
Where's my little patient?
That is not a child.
What kind of a doctor did you say you were?
I'm Dr. Benton Phillips, uh, pediatrician.
It was either him or the foot doctor.
Oh, no.
Don't worry, Miss.
I am a professional.
I'll just take his temperature.
Open for Mr. Mercury.
You die, bwana.
What do you think's wrong with him?
Well, he's obviously very hyperactive.
And somewhat sluggish.
That's not possible.
What's that?
Oh, it's Benny the Bunny : and his magic stethoscope.
I use it on the children.
But don't worry, it works just like a real one.
You see what I mean?
Either I have a defective bunny, or this man's heart has stopped.
Mindy, I guess it's time we told him.
Daddy, we can't.
We pro Well, we have to, Mindy.
It's his life.
Tell me what?
Doc, well You see, Doctor, he hasn't been here long.
He's a He's an alien from another planet.
Let me get this straight.
You're trying to tell me that I have been examining a man with no heartbeat who has a temperature of 63 degrees and comes from another planet, hmm?
You got it.
I've got no time for practical jokes.
I don't know how you tampered with my instruments, but my Mr. Mercury and my bunny were working before I came here.
And nobody makes a fool of Dr. Ducky.
Daddy, what are we going to do?
Oh honey, now take it easy, take it easy.
Everything is going to be all right.
I'll think of something.
Well, I guess the only thing left is we'll just call an ambulance.
See, I told you I'd think of something.
Now honey, everything is going to be all right.
The ambulance will be here in one minute, and don't worry about a thing.
They'll run through every red light in Boulder to get here.
Hello, this is an emergency.
A man is dying.
Yes, I'll hold.
Oh, no, he's gone!
What?
That-that's ridiculous.
Where did he go?
Well maybe he went back to the apartment.
Right.
Let's check it out.
Or he might have gone to that interview at the Vitamin Vendor.
Well, why would he go there?
He's only got an hour to live.
Daddy, his mind isn't working right, and he's dying to get a job.
Oh, why did I say that?
Will you look at me?
Look, if you can't handle drugs, don't do them, okay?
What do you mean, I don't give a hoot?
It's just  Oh.
we'll rap later.
Hi, Mork.
Here about the job?
No.
What are they saying?
I can dig your whole essence.
I can get right into your space where you're coming from and where you're at.
Whoa.
Is it quitting time?
I don't feel too well.
Maybe it's a nutrition thing.
Like, maybe your potassium is in an imbalance with your blood sugar.
You know, when that happens to me, I go straight for a Snickers bar.
There's a customer.
Now I want to see you wait on him.
How long should I wait?
Time is money, and money is relative.
Just see what he wants.
Wow, reality what a concept.
: What do you want?
Uh, do you have any wheat germ?
I hope not.
Everybody off!
My doctor says that I need to get more iron.
Now, what do you suggest?
Eat your car keys.
Uh, do you have any clover honey?
Oh, I'll check, sweetheart.
Never mind.
I'll-I'll just get some vitamins.
Um, I need some "A".
Aay!
Uh, B-l2.
Oh.
Too big for this store.
Uh, Miss?
I'm sorry.
My friend's biorhythms are the pits today.
Look, could, uh, I just have a bottle of Vitamin "A"?
Sure.
Mork, will you go over there and get the bottle with the green pills?
K.O. So, anyway, I feel that in addition to vitamins, a person should get a lot of exercise.
Like, I'm into transcendental tennis.
Transcendental tennis?
Yeah, we don't believe in actually hitting the ball.
We just kind of relate to the Look, could you please hurry it up?
: Okay    Shut up, Amy!
I don't know if it was my fault!
Here's one.
No, no.
If this is what vitamins do to you, I'm going back to junk food.
Thanks.
Come again.
Mork, I think there's something really wrong with you.
: Oh, no, nothing's wrong with me.
You see, everything's Oh, no.
Gleeks!
Everything's brown gleeks!
Everything's Brown Gleeks that's my favorite Rod McKuen album.
Gleek!
Recharge!
Gleek!
Mork.
Mindy.
Rainbow.
Gleek.
Oh, help me get him to the car.
He's really sick.
Okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Not the Vitamin Bender, the Vitamin Vendor.
Yes, that's "V" as in "vendor," "E" as in "ender," "N" as in "nn-der".
Oh, I've been trying to reach you.
Why did you bring him here?
I thought you'd take him straight to the hospital.
He insisted on coming home.
He says he has to find something.
Something called gleek or Gleek!
Gleek!
Oh, oh.
Got him?
Yes.
All right, let's get him to the couch.
Easy.
Oh Right on the couch.
Gleek.
Need gleek.
We've got to find out what a gleek is.
Right.
What time is it?
Uh, it-it's almost 1:30.
Oh!
Oh!
If we don't find out in ten more minutes, he doesn't stand a chance.
Chants?
On, no.
: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna  Uh, Mork, come on now.
Come on, settle down.
Take it easy, Mork.
Mork, remember you're sick.
Come here.
Okay.
Oh, no, there goes my sense of direction.
Oh, no.
Grab him.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I saw this once in a TV show.
Oh!
It worked.
Mork, you've got to help us.
What is wrong with you?
It's my birthday.
: Oh no, it's his birthday!
What's wrong with having a birthday?
I don't know.
What is wrong with having your birthday?
On Ork, a birthday comes only every 2,000 zymes.
When it does, our bodies go shazbot, and we get the gorgles.
Gorgles?
Are these gorgles contagious?
On, no.
There just like what you earthlings call dying.
Mork, you have got to tell us what a gleek is.
: Energy source.
Oh.
Recharge.
Mork, what does it look like?
Oh, no.
Now his voice is going.
Mork, you've got to tell us what a gleek looks like!
Give us a clue.
How big is it?
I think he's trying to tell us something.
Yeah, I feel like I'm in a Lassie movie.
A-A gleek is a-a chicken?
It's a bald chicken.
A bald chicken.
N-No, no.
An egghead.
It's an egghead!
It's an egg.
A gleek is an egg.
It's an egg.
I know.
I found an egg I found an egg on the counter this morning, and I put it in the refrigerator.
Okay, now Mork, Mork, look, don't worry.
After you get your gleek, your gorgles will be gone.
I can't believe I said that.
Mork, which one is it?
Yeah, come on.
Uh, gleek.
Oh!
Gleek.
Let me get something straight.
He's from a more advanced society?
Gleek!
Gleek!
Gleek!
Gleek!
Oh!
Mork.
Gleek!
Gleek!
Gleek!
Gleek!
Mork?
Oh, Mork.
Greetings.
Any calls for me while I was out?
Oh!
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Did you make it through your birthday, Mork?
Oh yes, sir, but they threw a very strange ceremony for me.
You see, Mindy made me a cake, and then it caught on fire.
What did you do?
You know me, sir, semper paratus.
I stomped that sucker right out, boy.
Ha, ha!
Good work, Mork.
Thank you, sir.
Well, now that you're getting older, you're going to have to settle down.
Since I've been on Earth, I'm not a bleemager anymore.
Does that mean I have to get boring?
Not boring, Mork, just more like me.
Well, I'd better keep having those zeppelins for breakfast then.
I mean it.
Stop acting like a child.
You have to start calming down.
Au contraire, Mon Grandiose.
The dullest people on Earth are the ones who think that they have to calm down and set a pattern for themselves as they grow older.
And that pattern dictates what they should be.
It gives them very little freedom to be who they are.
But everyone knows that as you grow older, you become more serious.
Ah, but isn't it true, sir, no matter how many years you have, you have to keep just a touch of the child in you?
A little bit of the "mondo bozo".
And you never feel old.
So until next week, this is Mork signing off.
Nanu-nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Stop it!
Stop!
Mork, your lesson is officially over.
Oh, really, Mrs. Hudson?
I want to get to the part where I get to go : "Oh, yeah"!
Hi.
Why, what's the matter, dear?
Oh, I've been having a hard time finding a part-time job that goes along with my journalism major, so I've been pounding the pavement all morning.
Oh, you shouldn't do that.
You might wake up the Chinese.
With the war going the way it is, they need a lot of sleep.
Anyway, I've been to newspapers and ad agencies and publishing companies, and they all say that I'm either too young or I don't have enough experience.
And one place wouldn't give me a job because they said I was a woman.
Well, next time, don't tell them.
Well, dear, I'm sure there's a businessman somewhere who would be glad to get hold of a young, eager woman.
Oh, there's plenty of those.
Except my major's journalism, not fooling around.
Oh, come on, Mindy.
Fooling around can be fun.
Watch.
Mork Come on, this is important to me!
Oh.
Boy, I've really blown it again.
Now I've got a right to play the blues.
Excuse me, sir.
Ma'am?
I'm looking for someone to give music lessons to my son.
Oh, you came to the right place.
That woman over there taught me everything I know.
No!
Mork!
Mork, please, I make my living from teaching music.
Oh, right now I feel like a light bulb in the Buckingham Palace.
What?
A royal screw-up.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hudson.
Well, sorry doesn't pay the rent.
Uh Mindy?
Hmm?
Why is this job so important to you?
Well, journalism courses are one thing, but I'd like to get out in the real world and write something good you know, something that will really excite people.
Why not try "For a good time, call Mindy".
Oh, hi, honey.
You're looking very pretty today.
Prettier than ever.
Good to see you, Mork.
Love your suspenders.
I'd give them to you, Pop, except my voice would : change.
Well, you certainly are in a good mood today.
Who was that on the phone?
I've met the kind of woman every man dreams about.
She's sophisticated, yet young at heart.
She's independent, yet vulnerable.
And she has a certain je ne sais quoi.
Qu'est-ce que c'est, "Je ne sais quoi"?
A figure that would stop a truck.
Oh.
Fat city, huh?
Well, I've never heard you talk like this.
You sound like you're really smitten.
Sounds like he's beyond smitten and into smut.
Mork, cool it!
No, that's all right.
When I'm feeling this good, he can say anything he wants to.
Oh, thanks, skinhead.
I've, um I've bought Margaret a little present.
Take a look.
I've got it right here.
I hope she likes it.
Now what do you think?
Wow!
One for each day of the week.
How come there are only six of them?
Sundays we rest!
Oh, I read you, Pop.
Oh-ho!
Yada, yada, yada, yada.
Hey, Dad, tell you what.
Why don't you invite Margaret to dinner at my house tomorrow night?
If she's not that busy Too busy?
For the man she calls "Ol' Tiger Lips"?
Listen, when I go like this, she jumps!
Well, I can't wait to meet the woman who finds you so fascinating.
Oh, actually, she's the one who's fascinating.
She was just appointed editor of Rocky Mountain Illustrated.
No kidding?
She's an editor?
Yeah.
Listen, I'll make a great roast beef and spell my resume out in niblets.
Yeah, and I'll provide the dinner music.
Watch.
Why don't we have our coffee in the living room?
Uh more vino, Margaret?
Oh, thank you, Fred.
Ahh Here let me help you up.
Mork, do you want some coffee?
No, thank you, ma'am.
Mork, you've been awfully quiet tonight.
Yes, sir, with all due respect.
You certainly have nice manners.
Oh, thank you, ma'am, but I was told if I didn't, I'd be blowing succotash out my nose.
He's such a kidder.
So, Margaret, I'm really excited about your offer.
I can't tell you how hard I've been looking for a job.
Well, I always try to encourage young writers, and I'd especially like to help you.
You're exactly like your father described you.
Well, thank you.
That's funny.
You're not at all like he described you.
I was expecting a big brake pedal.
What?
Well, he said you had a figure that could stop a truck.
Why thank you, Fred.
Oh, I think what Mork is trying to say is that my father finds you very attractive.
Yes, yes, that's it.
I guess you're the only one that can do it.
Do what?
Well, he says whenever he does this, you jump.
Come on, you can do it.
Up, up.
Let's go.
Through the hoop.
There we go.
Come on.
Mork!
Mork!
Oh, I guess your thighs are tired.
You'd better give those little suckers a rest, then.
Well Margaret, I-I just really want to thank you again for inviting me by your office tomorrow.
It's nice of you to give Mindy a job even though she's a woman.
Well, what's wrong with being a woman?
Mindy says it's hard for a woman to get a job unless she fools around.
Well, it so happens, Mindy, that some of us are quite successful solely because of our ability.
That's right.
I mean, who would want to fool around with Margaret?
Oh, really?
Oh, I mean I mean That's not what I meant.
Sometimes things uh come out the way I didn't mean them.
Well, you're doing awfully good for a man with tiger lips.
Tiger lips?
You told them?
I suppose you told them about "Let's Play Circus," too?
And "Bambi Bottom"!
Ooh, soft, whoa.
I think I've heard enough.
I'm leaving.
Uh, Margaret!
Margaret!
And about that interview, Mindy sorry, we're only hiring men.
N-N-No, wait!
Wait!
Bambi!
Cute couple.
Anything I can do to help?
Help?
!
Haven't you done enough already?
In one night, you have ruined my father's life, and you've ruined my life.
Boy, Mork, sometimes I just wish you'd mind your own business!
Mork calling Orson Come in, Orson Mork calling Orson Come in, Orson Mork calling Orson Come in, Orson You're lucky to catch me in, Mork.
You're calling at the wrong time.
That figures, sir.
I can't seem to do anything right recently.
That's why I want to come home, Orson.
Why?
I thought you like it down there.
No, sir, I don't seem to fit in very well.
It seems that no matter how hard I try, I keep lousing up the lives of the people I care for.
I've got to come home, sir.
I'm-I'm pig slop.
I want you to stay there and keep sending back those reports about Earth behavior.
It's no use, sir.
I've goofed up the entire year I've been here, and I want to leave before I cause serious damage to someone's life.
I'm-I'm worm sweat.
I think you're being a little hard on yourself, Mork.
Oh, not at all, sir.
It's just that I'm bean dip, and I've got to come home.
Well, perhaps.
But let's make sure.
If you don't mind submitting yourself to the Plasmic Essence Reversifier.
Oh, that sounds wonderful, sir.
I'd love it!
What is it?
A newly developed process which will enable you to see what paths your friends would have taken the past year, had you not come into their lives.
I know what that'd be.
They'd be better off without me.
Why don't you see for yourself?
You will merely be an observer unable to be seen or heard.
When I activate the Reversifier, the entire year of your experiences on Earth will be erased.
All right, sir.
I'm ready.
Rub me out.
I'm putting you on rewind.
: Whoa, talk about your reruns.
Mindy!
Mindy!
It's me.
Mork!
Oh-ho!
Mindy, Mindy Mindy!
It's Morko, the pinheaded boy.
Ha-ha!
I'm home.
Fun's fun, joke's over.
Okay.
Guess Orson's right.
She can't see me or hear me.
Maybe she can feel me.
I'll give her a tickle.
She always used to love that.
Ooh, I guess I'm not here, so she can't even feel me.
It's too bad, she was always a great tickle.
Whoa, Frederick's had a sale.
Hi, honey.
Well, I'm home.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, a ring!
Oh, no.
Mindy's married.
I guess I was right.
Mindy'd be awfully happy without me here.
Get me a beer, will you?
Sure, honey.
I'm really anxious to hear about your big day.
Yeah, me, too.
Who is that, Mindy?
Oh, I remember.
That was your blind date.
He came over and I was going to stick around with you so he wouldn't bump into things.
He never saw you again.
I guess old Mork the home wrecker would have prevented you from getting married.
Here you go.
Now tell me everything.
I want to hear all about it.
Look, I need a little time to unwind, huh?
Oh, sure.
I'll help.
Oh.
I guess there's no need for this Orkan around here anymore.
I'm going miss you, Mind.
I'd give you a hug but I can't.
Take care.
If you ever need me, just whistle.
Hello.
Well, I might as well tell you.
You're going to find out anyway.
I was fired.
Well, what happened this time?
Oh, a thorn in the bed of roses.
Well, it wasn't my fault.
You see, I owed Red, my bookie, a couple of bucks, so he repossessed the company car.
My boss resented it.
Cliff, you promised that you were going to try and quit gambling.
So what's the big deal?
You've got two jobs.
Two jobs?
Oh, that's wonderful, Mindy.
You're pursuing your writing career.
That's fantastic.
Oh, that's another reason why you don't need me around.
Ciao.
Do you think that I like being a salesgirl and a cocktail waitress?
Wiping fingerprints off of a counter during the day and off of this at night?
When do you have time to write?
And then all my money goes to pay off your gambling debts.
You know, we could have had a house by now.
Buzz off, huh?
Do you know what you are?
I'll tell him.
You're You're a toad tush!
You're scuttle butt!
You're whale whiz!
Come on, come on, come on.
What?
Forget it.
Oh, come on, Mindy, use your imagination.
At least call him moose mush.
I've had enough.
Yeah, I've had enough of you, too, mildew mouth.
Come on out here!
Cliff.
Come on out here, clown!
I'll zap you!
Oh, Mindy, this wouldn't happen if I was around.
Boy, I'd nail him.
I'd stick my finger down his throat and weld his tonsils together.
If he tried to give you any lip, it'd sound like .
Can you get down off that bed and stop playing with that stupid ball of yarn!
Look at the good side, at least you have a pet.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Oh, Mrs. Hudson's your pet?
She's cute, and she can't kill birds.
That's wonderful.
Are you all right, Grandma?
Oh, yes, dear.
I was just sitting there knitting like I always do.
I'm knitting a new shawl for Iran.
Oh, that's where I left that other needle.
I'll get that.
Hello!
Daddy!
When did you get back in town?
Tonight.
Oh, sweetheart.
Freddy!
Oh, Cora.
Oh, Freddy.
I can't believe you changed this much in eight months!
Whoa!
Everyone run for your lives!
It's the invasion of the scalp snatchers!
Hide your noses, everyone.
Hide your noses.
So, how was Europe?
C'est magnifique.
Oh.
And where's my favorite son-in-law, Cliff, huh?
Don't ask.
Uh, he's probably taking a nap or something.
Oh, I understand.
He probably worked hard all day.
You're in for a big surprise.
Honey, I was so happy when you got married.
Well, it looks like even you can be happy without my being here.
You have a wonderful husband, and Cora has a home where she's welcome and loved, and I could finally sell the house and the store and get out and see the world and grab for some gusto.
I decided it was time to catch up on the life of a single man.
So I flew to the Continent, and I met Veronica.
Veronica?
Uh-huh.
A former Miss Teenage Bulgaria.
Ah, she was the kind of woman every man dreams of.
She had a certain je ne sais quoi.
I can translate for you.
: "I like you".
The times we spent together, dancing till dawn  champagne suppers on the strand,  and sailing into the sunset.
Dive!
Dive!
Dive!
Mindy, where's dinner?
Oh, the plot clots.
Cliff!
Son, how are you?
Oh, look who's back.
You going to live here, too?
I used to, but now things have Look, if you don't have dinner ready, I'm going to Red's place.
Give me some money.
No, don't, Mind No, Cliff, you're just going to gamble it away anyway, and right now we need every penny we can get.
I'll get it myself.
Where's your wallet?
No, no, wait.
Keep away from that.
Don't do No, keep your hands off her tips!
Stop thief!
Stop!
Good-bye, Cliff.
Hope you fall off your name.
I had no idea.
Oh, today's one of his good days.
I'm sorry.
Maybe I should go and talk to him.
Oh, no, Pops, don't do that.
You don't want footprints on your new rug again, do you?
Where is this Red's place?
Oh, it's a bookie joint.
You can't miss it.
It used to be the music store.
Things sure have changed.
It's too bad.
Can I do anything to help you, dear?
No, thanks, Grandma.
I'd just like to be alone for awhile.
Well, if you have someone nearby, dear, who loves you, you'll never be alone.
Oh, what a McKuen-like thing to say, Grandma.
I'll go booby- trap the bed.
Now let's see.
Cliff sleeps on the right side, yes.
Oh, don't cry.
I don't want to see your eyes leaking.
Don't cry, it's not the end of the world.
That comes in the year 2118 when the giant bees come.
And Regis Philbin is elected President of the United States.
Oh, Mindy, come on.
I got a joke.
Here's something to cheer you up.
Knock, knock.
Oh, bad choice, huh?
Wait, Mind.
Come on, don't be sad.
Hey, listen, here's a joke.
What do you get when you cross a German Shepherd and a giraffe?
A watchdog for the eighth floor.
All right, here's another one, okay.
Why did Einstein throw his brother's clock out the window?
He wanted to see relative time.
Come on, Mind, they laugh at this on Mercury, and they don't even have mouths.
Oh, Mindy.
Wait, look.
Look at this.
A little Martian yarmulke.
Oh, look.
Look.
Mick Jagger.
Talk about your midnight rambler.
Oh, Mind, hey, don't cry.
Listen, you wouldn't be crying if I was here.
Come on.
There's no reason to cry.
Here's your wallet.
Oh, thanks, Pop.
Thanks, Dad.
Oh, honey.
Oh, Dad.
Honey, honey, take it easy.
Come on, let's go sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk.
Oh, sweetheart I have a confession to make.
I'm alone, too.
Veronica lasted just as long as my money, which wasn't very long.
Well, you still have me.
Me, too.
Well I guess I won't be needing this anymore.
Or the lies that went with it.
I can't understand it.
Cliff seemed to have so much promise.
Oh, he did till he started gambling, and it just sort of took over his life.
And now he's he's willing to gamble on anything but us.
You know, I'd always hoped you'd meet someone who was mature responsible, independent.
Yet somebody who was, mm, easygoing.
Oh, say, what's happening, man?
What's happening?
Carefree.
Oh.
Lah.
And somebody who was full of life.
The most important thing to me is somebody who can make me laugh.
Oh, Mindy, I used to be able to make you laugh.
Hey, remember.
You know what I'd like to do?
Let's go for a walk the way we used to.
I'd like that.
Yeah, me, too.
Let's all go.
Oh, honey, look.
It's starting to rain.
That's okay.
I like walking in the rain.
That way nobody can tell if you're crying.
I can   Orson, I've seen enough.
I don't want her to end up like this.
Please, bring me back to now.
Mork, I have to talk to you.
You have to talk to me?
Really?
You can see me?
Whoa, it's a wonderful life!
Mork Ha-ha!
She touched me.
Yazoo yazoo!
Mork, I want to apologize for snapping at you a minute ago.
Oh, no, you can be mean and nasty any time you want.
Oh, no, I can't.
Yes, you can, you can, you can, you can, you can, can, can, can.
You see you have to be patient with me.
I was upset because I thought I'd lost a job.
But I'd rather lose a hundred jobs than a friend like you.
Oh, listen, I'm new at this, and I've got a lot to learn, but if anyone's going to mess up your life, I hope for your sake, it's me.
Oh.
Ha, ha, ha, har, ar.
Oh.
Oh, that reminds me of a joke.
What do you get when you cross a German Shepherd and a giraffe?
A watchdog for the eighth floor.
How did you know that?
I'm not sure.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson Come in, Your Fattitude Yow, baby, get down  I'll be with you in a moment, Mork.
There's a caller on another brain cell.
I'll hold.
Yes, what is it?
Sorry, there's no one named Juanita here.
Juanita no en la casa.
Good-bye.
I'd love to know who had this brain before me.
Sounds like Ricardo Montalban.
Sir, you'll never guess what I learned.
You'll never guess.
Go on, take one guess.
Too late!
Okay, I'll tell you.
I learned that I'm okay.
I'm not as bad as I thought I was.
That's a lesson one can only learn from the School of Oneself.
Wow, what a Werner-like thing to say.
But you know something, Orson?
I'd like to thank you for letting me see what Mindy's life would be like without me.
But please, I never want to see what my life would be like without her.
You know, Mork, I think you're beginning to grow.
Well, sir, I don't know how much value I have in this universe, but I do know that I made a few people happier than they would've been without me, and as long as I know that, I'm as rich as I ever need to be.
So I'll catch you on the rebound, Your Magnitude.
Until next week.
Nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Nanu-nanu.
Shazbot!
Mindy?
What?
Guess what followed me home?
What followed you home?
Can I keep it, huh, Mindy, huh?
Can I, hmm?
This is one of those questions I always dread.
All right, what is it?
It's real cute.
Mm-hmm.
It's fuzzy.
Mm-hmm.
It's about this tall.
A dog that's been run over by a truck?
Oh, Mindy, that's so sick.
Squashed dogs can't follow you home.
Look.
It's a kittypiller!
Oh, that's a caterpillar.
Not for a few weeks yet, it hasn't got hair on its chest.
No, they're always called caterpillars.
Oh, idiot moi.
Well, does it have a name yet?
Well, I like to call her Bob.
See?
She looked up when I said her name.
Oh, that end isn't her head.
Really?
I thought she was smiling at me.
Here we go, Bob.
There we go.
Go for a walk in the candy dish.
There we go.
Now, I hope you're not hypoglycemic.
So, Mork, a caterpillar followed you home, huh?
Yeah, I had to walk real slow and like this.
How do you know that it's a girl?
Are you kidding, with a body like that?
Well, I think you have a lovely insect and you two do make a lovely couple, but I have a French class tonight and I'm going to go change my clothes.
Oh, why don't you show Bob the rest of the house.
Thank you.
Now, Bob, don't get mad.
It's all right.
You'll get to like Mindy once you get to know her.
She's just a little jealous.
I mean, she doesn't have a fur coat like yours.
Well, now that we're here, let's relax.
Sit down.
Put your feet up.
Put your feet up.
Put your feet up.
Put your feet up.
I'll be right back, my petite fuzz.
Un moment.
Why don't you slip into something more silky.
Ar-ark!
Mork!
Exidor!
In this life, yes.
Do you mind?
We're having a private conversation.
I told you guys to wait on the moped.
Get out!
Entourages can be the pits.
Exidor, come in.
Sit down.
I'd like you to meet my insect.
Plenty of time for that later.
Mork I have come here to preach the only true religion.
What's the only true religion this time?
Reincarnation!
We have all lived before, and we shall all be born again.
Oh, the ultimate dÃ©jÃ  vu.
In a previous life, I was a very famous person.
Guess who.
Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?
Just to meet girls.
Are you currently in a Broadway show?
No.
Are you bigger than a bread box?
Yes.
I got it.
You're the editor of the National Enquirer.
He's not dead.
I can wait.
I'm surprised, Mork.
I thought you'd guess.
I was Julius Caesar.
I had the little laurel leaves right around the ear.
And if you look closely, you can even see a little mulch.
You were Julius Caesar?
Absolutely.
I know because I get stabbing pains every Ides of March.
Really?
Then you'll enjoy meeting my new friend, Bob.
You made friends with a fuzzy Tootsie Roll?
No, it's, no, look closer.
It's a caterpillar.
Why, this is no ordinary caterpillar, Mork.
This is the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln!
No!
Yes!
How can you tell?
Is that the face of someone who would tolerate slavery?
That's not her face.
Really?
I thought she was smiling at me.
Well, I have to be going, but don't worry, Mork, I'll be coming back if you get my drift.
Mork I know her.
Cleopatra!
It's me, Julie!
What?
How quickly they forget.
Those robes somehow look strangely familiar.
They ought to be after what you and Marc Antony did to him.
You and that asp of yours.
You know, Mork, between your friends and your pets, I sometimes wonder if you're an advanced alien being, or just an intergalactic bozo.
The answer is  Both!
Oh, look Mindy, Bob's hungry.
Do you have anything green in the ice box?
Hmm last month's cottage cheese.
Oh, leafy green is better than lumpy green, but I'll give it a try.
Listen, I'm going to be late for class.
I've got to go.
Hey, maybe you can get something from Mr. Bickley.
No, I've already had my shots.
I mean food, silly.
Bye.
I'll see you later.
You have a bug for a pet?
Oh, yes.
I pulled a thorn out of his paw and the other 13 legs followed me home.
Nobody has a bug for a pet.
Are you kidding?
Bob's clean.
She's leaf-broken.
She's a skilled mime, too.
Bob, do your "Caterpillar Walking Against the Wind".
Bugs can't do diddly.
Now, a dog is something you can train.
Look.
Bickie, oh, sweetheart.
Bickie can do lots of tricks.
You can train him to do anything.
Look, he can wave.
Wave, Bickie.
He can salute.
He can pledge allegiance Oh, yeah?
Bob can pledge allegiance to 14 countries at once!
Bickie can sit up and beg.
Well, Bob doesn't have to.
She's independently wealthy.
That's stupid.
If you put that thing on the rug, it would look like a cigarette burn.
I'm a busy man.
I'm having my dinner and I don't have to sit around and listen while you try to convince me that your insipid bug is superior to my stupid dog.
Oh, really?
You shouldn't have said that.
Bob, no!
Bob, no!
Down, Bob!
Down, Bob!
I don't want to listen to any more of this inane conversation about insects.
Are you implying that you want me to bug off?
Right.
All right.
I hope you realize, Mr. Bickley, that you're being awfully cruel.
You're hurting the feelings of another life-form.
Okay, I'll be good.
Your pet, Bob, has one worthwhile use.
What's that?
He'd make a great bookmark.
Oh  Where is the "other woman"?
Shh.
She's asleep.
In a brand-new, combination log cabin and condominium.
See?
I built her a little hot tub and some lawn furniture.
Here's a little chaise lounge and inside, she has a beetle for a chauffeur, a dragonfly for a hairdresser.
She's got a little vicious watch-ant to protect her property, see?
It always goes for the toes.
: Nyah, nyah!
And tomorrow I'm going to take her to the movie The Swarm, because Bob says she knows one of the stunt bees personally.
Well, you certainly are being nice to her, Mork.
I can see why she looks up to you.
Mindy, Bob looks up to everybody.
Yeah, but not everybody's that nice to their pet.
Yeah, I know.
Tomorrow I'm going to take her for a crawl.
Now, where would you take a caterpillar for a crawl?
Well, she loves the outdoors, so that's why I'm taking her to your philodendron so she can feel a little dirt between her toes and crawl softly and slowly.
So, how's that French class of yours?
Comme ci, comme Ã§a.
What's that mean?
: Eeh-eh, eeh-eh.
Did you hear that, Bob?
Comme ci, comme Ã§a means eeh-eh.
I do that, too.
Bob, you got to wake up now, sleepyhead.
Come on, you can't sleep your whole life away.
Time for a little Yoga.
Let's go.
Bob!
Nova!
Come on, Bob.
Bob What are you doing?
I'm giving her cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
It's too late.
Bob's dead.
Ooh Oh, she was so young, so beautiful.
She had so much to live for.
I was going to buy her those ballet shoes.
Mork, even caterpillars have to die.
There's one last hope.
Exidor's coming in a minute.
Why did you call him?
Maybe he can bring Bob back.
He's into reincarnation.
Oh, Mork, you're just going to have to face the facts.
Bob is gone for good.
Oh, I know.
I blame myself.
I should have known she was sick when she looked up and went "Ug-Ugh"!
Mork, it was only a bug!
What?
!
All right, I didn't mean that, but it's not your fault that it died.
Oh, you're right.
Yeah, you're right.
It was your fault, wasn't it?
Yeah, you were jealous, weren't you?
You had better legs, but she had more of them.
Now that she's dead, you want to laugh!
Well, go ahead.
Awr-awr-awr-awr!
Mork, what are you saying?
!
: Oh, Mindy, Mindy, Oh Mindy!
Oh Oh!
If this is the emotion of grief, it really stinks.
Oh, Mork, I understand.
Earthlings feel the same way when a pet they love dies.
Love ha!
Who said it was love?
It was just a stupid bug.
I know what you're going through.
I really do.
Oh, Mindy, how could I say that about her?
I worshipped the ground that she crawled on.
Mork!
I came over as soon as you called.
What's wrong?
Abraham Lincoln's dead again.
Um, excuse me, Mr. Exidor, but what exactly is it that you do?
I'm a spirit migration engineer.
You're a grave robber?
No, that's a body migration engineer.
: Oh oh, no.
It's all right, Mork.
We still have time.
If we hurry, we can bring Bob back as a lower life-form.
What's lower than a caterpillar?
A caterpillar trainee.
Oh How can we do that?
The entire process has been formulated scientifically by Dr. Paul Kerns, Professor of Reincarnation at Colorado Tech.
Well, as long as it's scientific.
First, we'll do the magic incantation.
Repeat after me: Ohwah Ohwah Ta jer Ta jer Kiam.
Kiam.
Now repeat it quickly, Mork.
Ohwah ta jer kiam.
Ohwah ta jer kiam.
Oh, what a jerk I am.
Oh, what a jerk Exidor, how can you make jokes at a time like this?
!
Mork, lighten up.
You're always so serious.
But Bob's dead.
Not dead, just preparing her comeback.
It's now time for the Ritual Reincarnation Boogie.
Arise, oh, defunct creepy crawler!
Arise, oh, many-legged cadaver!
Well, that's that.
What's what?
Nothing happened!
Oh, that's a shocker.
Bob has been reincarnated as a cow.
That's wonderful.
No, that's terrible!
He'll be eaten.
No, she's safe.
She's in India.
She's sacred.
: Holy cow.
Remember to call me if anybody else you love dies.
Oh, well, thanks so much for everything.
You used to have the best barge in Egypt.
Hey, you kids, get away from that mule!
Mindy, I know.
Sometimes Exidor can have Swiss cheese for brains, but tell me the truth, Bob's gone forever, isn't she?
Yes.
Oh.
Well, what do you Earthlings do when your pets die?
Oh, well, usually we have a little funeral and then flush them down I mean, uh, we we bury them.
We can do that for Bob, then, can we?
Sure we can, Mork.
We'll talk about it tomorrow, okay?
Oh, thanks, Mindy.
Well, I'd better get started.
Started doing what?
Well, it's the least I can do.
I've got to notify the 86 million next of kin.
Bob is dead.
Pass it on.
How about late August?
Yeah, yeah, it's usually pretty dead around here then.
Oh I'll talk to you later, Jim.
Just got a vertical.
Hello.
May I be of assistance?
Yes.
Is this the place where you bring the dead?
Those who have passed into spirit are always welcome here.
I don't know if she passed into spirit, but she sure croaked.
Yes, well, you are in the right place.
Please, uh, sit down, won't you?
Now, was the deceased a relative of yours?
No.
I only knew her a few days.
Oh, you're very kind to be making arrangements for her everlasting peace.
Well, it's the least I could do; we lived together.
Oh, I see.
Well, not to worry.
We here at the Herman Funeral Home, we don't make judgments on our clients' lifestyles.
What was her name?
Bob.
I see.
And the last name?
I don't know.
Last names weren't important to us.
I can imagine.
Well now, I would only assume that you would want Bob to have the best.
That sounds wonderful.
Now, what would you like for an epitaph?
Well, I could start off with a shrimp cocktail, have some espresso  No, I mean what would you like written on the headstone?
Oh.
Here lies Bob.
She's dead.
It's a beautiful sentiment.
And totally accurate.
Now, let's see.
Adding on a simple wreath, a small spray of flowers, pallbearers, basic ceremony and a compact hearse That comes to $2,800.
For what?
For the funeral, the expenses.
You mean it costs money to die?
Only if you want to die decently.
Bob died great.
And nothing you can do will make her feel any better.
But the point is to make you feel better.
Well, the only way I'll feel better is if Bob stayed with me forever and ever.
And that's exactly what I'm going to do keep her with me in my room.
Keep her with you in your  Some cocktail party.
Where's the pretzels?
What are you talking about?
Mork sent me this card saying he was having a cocktail party.
Well, I knew you wouldn't come if I told you it was a funeral.
A funeral?
Who died?
Our dear departed Bob.
That caterpillar?
I thought she keeled over weeks ago.
Renewed sorrow!
Anguish!
And assorted other emotions.
He's been keeping that thing in his pocket.
I finally convinced him it was time to put poor old Bob to rest.
Well, if you'll excuse me Oh, no, please don't go, Mr. Bickley.
I don't go to bug wakes.
Look, I know this sounds silly, but Mork really loved that bug.
And besides, for afterwards, I got a bottle of your favorite snack.
Oh, all right.
But don't ask me to view the body.
Please be seated.
Hey, what's this?
I've never seen a casket that offers a course in computer programming.
: What can you say about a caterpillar?
Bob was all that and more.
She was a friend, a joy, an inspiration.
Bob will never do the things she dreamed of now that she's stiff city.
It's not going to be easy to follow in her footsteps, but tomorrow, seven of us are going to try.
All I have to say in closing is, "If you knew Bobbie like I knew Bobbie, oy, oy, oy, what a bug".
And now to say a few words, a fine, upstanding shiksa in her own right a personal friend of mine and Bobbie's, Mindy McConnell.
: Please come up Me?
!
Uh although, uh, Bob and I lived under th-the same roof, we-we never really knew each other that well.
I mean, I'm even afraid of spiders, right?
Anyway, in spite of our differences, I-I feel that I-I got to know Bob better than any other caterpillar I ever met, and, uh she sure was great, Bob was.
Thank you, Mindala.
And now, a man who is said to have the warmth of a snow pea Mr. Bickley.
Mr. Bickley, a few words.
With heavy heart and mournful eyes and tears that softly flow we say our final, sad good-byes, to a fuzzy escargot.
Hog slop.
When I first met Bob, I had no way of knowing she was on her last legs.
But, uh, I realized she was a good pet.
Not as good as dog, though.
A dog can hop up on your bed and snuggle his cute little face next to you : in the bed and softly whimper when he's hungry and and put his little paw in yours as though to say, "I love you, Daddy".
Oh, I can't take it anymore!
I'm coming, Bickey!
Daddy's coming!
Daddy's!
And now it's time for the burial.
Oh, you want the Evelyn Wood version?
I want to bury her out here in your philodendron so she'd always be outdoors.
Oh who are you and what have you done with Bob?
That is Bob, Mork.
She's turned into a butterfly.
Quick, take her to the window.
Mindy, I don't understand.
What's happening?
Well, see, Bob wasn't dead.
She was just changing.
Caterpillars turn into butterflies.
Oh, I guess I'd better set her free.
There we go, Bob.
Fly, Bob!
Be free!
There you go, Bob!
Oh, she was beautiful.
Yeah.
Well, now I guess you probably believe what Exidor said about reincarnation, right?
No, I still think Exidor had his head up his foot.
Maybe he's right, though.
Maybe when you die, something beautiful happens.
That's a nice thought.
Hey, let's go follow Bob.
All right.
I could have made it.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Yo, Battlestar Gigantica.
Here I am, Mork.
What do you have to report?
Well, sir, this week I learned many wonderful things.
First of all, I learned the meaning of the old Earth phrase, "You can't take it with you," because I went to the place where you have to leave it.
It's called a funeral home.
Is that where they put old funerals?
Close, you old gobbler.
You get half a laugh for that one.
No, actually a funeral is like a track meet.
First of all, you have to wear black, you don't need a stopwatch, and one of the guys is really lousy in a relay race.
You really have a way with words, Mork.
Oh, thank you, Your Immenseness.
You should have heard the eulogy I did for my caterpillar.
Mindy says that when he dies, he'll go to Heaven and be with all the other bugs and he'll be very happy and everything will be beautiful.
Tell me, if Heaven is so beautiful, so perfect, so great, how come humans don't want to die?
Who wants to be with all those bugs?
What do you think happens when something dies, Mork?
I don't know, sir.
All I know is when my caterpillar became a butterfly and sprouted wings and flew away, she looked kind of a like a little angel.
See you next week.
