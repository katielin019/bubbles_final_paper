{START OF EPISODE 1}
Waiting for the Robert E. Lee?
No, sir, it's Major Burns.
He was due back from "R" and "R" at 2400 hours.
I sent out the daily report and said he was back.
You've been here all night?
- At 0400 hours, I had to go to the latrine.
- You took the scenic route.
- Yes, sir.
- Check his tent?
He could have come in while you were sitting with Batman and Robin.
- No, I checked.
- It's not like Burns.
He's a lousy surgeon, a pain in the butt however, he's always on time.
- I know.
That's why I'm worried.
- Relax.
Cigar?
- Won't it stunt my growth?
- What do you got to lose?
Is it habit forming?
No.
I've been smoking five cigars a day for 45 years.
- Never got the habit.
- That's good to know.
-  - So far so good.
- Mm, when do I suck?
- I'll let you know.
Now.
Couple more times.
There you go.
Nothing like a good cigar on a bright, clear morning.
Or Cream of Wheat.
I can't believe it.
There's some sausages left.
- Frank Burns isn't here.
- Thank you.
- What's that, Klinger?
- Scrambled eggs.
Would you like a glass?
- You got a straw?
- Just ran out.
Pass.
Ah, bonjour, mademoiselle.
Comment allez- vous?
Ah, it feels good to come home from a hard day at the factory sit down with my loved ones for a delightful repast.
You do have a way with words.
Yeah, I talk real good.
- Where's Major Burns?
- Not back from leave yet.
It was very thoughtful of you two to arrange for his "R" and "R".
It was that or go bonkers.
That midnight whimpering.
You say he actually wept into his pillow?
His pillow, his pants, everything.
- I've never seen a man fall apart like that.
- Plucky chap, though.
He did stand up at her wedding as best man.
Because we held him up.
You know, l-I've never wanted to bring this up before but I have a suspicion that Major Burns and Major Houlihan were somewhat attached.
They knew each other in the biblical sense.
- Both testaments.
- Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
He's a married man.
My worst fears are confirmed.
That's it, son.
There you go.
Oh.
Oh, that cigar.
Oh, it's all part of growing up.
You feel better?
Colonel, how can you smoke these things?
- You get used to it.
I got sick on my first one.
- How old were you?
I was nine.
The cigar was 11.
Is that how come you're so short?
How would you like to be a P.F.C.?
You're tall.
Oh, choppers.
I can't see anything.
Is it Burns?
No, sir, it's coming from the north.
It must be wounded.
- There's more than one.
- Alert the staff.
- Okay if I throw the cigar away?
- You got a cold?
- No.
-  - Choppers!
Choppers!
-  - Choppers!
Choppers!
-  Salkowitz, gimme a hand!
- Hey, you're a medic.
- Our battalion aid station got hit.
Crummy war.
- All right, pre-op and move it.
- What a mess.
Some of these guys got clobbered twice.
Once on the line - then three hours later at the aid station.
- Their lucky day.
Move him into pre-op.
Father?
So young.
The younger they get, the older I get.
You're lucky, Sergeant.
That's not too bad.
We'll have you out of here in no time.
Hey, Doc, can you make it a little worse?
I don't wanna go back up there.
Well, we'll see.
Maybe I can drop a stitch.
Medic!
Get him to pre-op.
Start an I.V. And give him some plasma.
Hell of a time for Burns to be late.
We can use every inept surgeon we can get.
When's Margaret due back from her honeymoon?
Two more days.
Superficial.
Post-op.
I wish I was with her.
- For crying out loud, she's with her husband.
- I wouldn't peek.
Sirs, one of the wounds is a doctor.
Dr. Berman, I'm Dr. Pierce.
Don't waste your time, Doctor.
We just met, already he's kibitzing.
- Right hemothorax, full of blood.
- Don't talk.
Pericardial tamponade, full of blood.
We'll fix you up, Doctor.
Fragment near the heart.
You got a rabbi?
We got a priest who loves Al Jolson.
- Get him.
- Knock that off, Berman.
Nobody dies around here without my say-so.
Be careful.
- What do you think?
- I gotta try.
I just hope Father Mulcahy can pray right to left.
-  How's Berman?
- I got a chest tube in.
He's still bleeding.
- Can he travel to Seoul?
- He may not even make it to post-op.
Klinger.
- What's the matter?
- Snapped my garter belt.
Don't expect a Purple Heart.
Special case there.
We need a nice, slow ride.
There you go, Sarge.
Didn't even tingle, did it?
- You're gonna be fine.
- Finished already, huh, Doc?
- Local anesthetic, seven stitches.
- Can't you find anything else?
A hangnail, but the manicurist doesn't come in on Mondays.
- Klinger?
- What am I, the only medic in the shop?
You're loved, you fool.
Command me, oh tall one with the Presbyterian features.
- Bed rest, then ambulatory.
- Bed rest, then ambulatory.
Where the hell is Burns?
If we're lucky, he deserted.
You don't suppose No, no, no, no.
- What?
What?
- No, it's ludicrous.
- Come on.
What?
What?
- Well, Margaret's on her honeymoon in Tokyo and Frank's late getting back from Seoul.
- You think Frank went to Tokyo?
- What could he do there?
Put saltpeter in Penobscott's teriyaki.
-  - You boys are getting punchy.
I don't know why.
Six hours of surgery is like a walk in the Vienna woods.
My varicose veins are pounding.
- I can hear them.
-  Done and done.
Klinger!
This is crazy.
I gotta get on the horn to "l" Corps.
See if we can trace Burns.
We need another surgeon.
Over there.
Just park it there.
Get my bag, Corporal.
Major Houlihan, is that you?
No, it's Amelia Earhart.
Who do you think it is?
- You.
- Oh, you dumb ninny.
How come you're back so early from your honeymoon?
- You're not my father.
- No, ma'am.
I sure am glad to see you though.
We got a terrible lot of wounded, and Major Burns isn't back from "R" and "R" yet.
He isn't?
All right, I'll get changed and get right over.
- Did you have a good time?
- Oh, stuff it.
- That's nice.
-   - MASH 4077.
-  I got it, Radar.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Colonel.
- Colonel Potter here.
Who's this?
- I didn't know you had it, sir.
- I've got it.
- Yes, sir.
You certainly do.
- What was your name again, Sergeant?
Sergeant Williams, sir.
Military Police, "l" Corps.
Do you have a Major Frank Burns in your unit?
Medium build, beady eyes, weak chin?
That's him.
He was involved in an incident here in Seoul.
And our report says that while drunk he accosted a blonde WAC.
Kept calling her Margaret.
Acted like he was shampooing her hair.
And then begged to clip her toenails.
Ran off before we could apprehend him.
Is he there, sir?
No, and he's long overdue.
Keep me posted, Sergeant.
- Jackass Burns.
Radar.
- Yes, sir.
Is he on his way, sir?
On his way to a Section Eight.
He's down in Seoul flipping his beanie.
Get hold of a Colonel Baldwin at Tokyo General.
- Tell him we're desperate for a surgeon.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be in O.R. If my legs get me that far.
- I think you're tired, Colonel.
You know, Radar, you should have gone to medical school.
- Hello, Tokyo.
- Hello, Tokyo.
## Double pair, royal.
That's 121 points -  - ##  - And the game.
- Damn cribbage!
Ah, Colonel, for a brief moment, you thought you had me but I scooted away.
What's the damage, Winchester?
Well, in round figures you owe me $672.11.
-  - Colonel, I want to thank you - for teaching me this game.
- Colonel?
Colonel Baldwin here.
Yes?
I told you not to call me when I'm in conference.
Oh, yeah, that's Potter's outfit.
What do they want?
How long do they need?
- No, it's impossible.
-  Colonel, made a small error.
You owe me $672.17.
It's possible.
Care to put your head in the noose again?
I'd love to, but you won't have time.
For the next 48 hours, you belong to a MASH unit that's short a man.
MASH?
That's one of those traveling medicine shows, isn't it?
Right.
Grab the next flight to Seoul and get out to Colonel Potter at the 4077 th.
Why send your best doctor into a war zone?
Relax.
It's just like two days here except for the artillery and the snakes.
- Better get moving, Winchester.
- Surely you jest.
Surely you go.
We got a new surgeon on the way.
- A Major Charles Emerson Winchester.
-  I knew a Winchester.
-  I knew an Emerson.
-  I got an Uncle Charles.
Well, at least we won't be working with a stranger.
Corporal Klinger?
X rays on Brophy.
Coming!
I can give you this in 8x 10s, wallet-size or our matchbook covers.
- You certainly move fast, Klinger.
- Basic delicatessen training.
Put your finger on that artery.
Scalpel.
- Major Houlihan!
-  Look who's here.
What a pleasant surprise.
- Uh-oh, Lulu's back in town.
- Keep working.
Keep working.
I'll take over, Baker.
You look exhausted.
Mrs. Penobscott, it's a pleasure to have your finger in my work again.
How come you're back here so early?
Shouldn't you be wearing out your Do Not Disturb sign?
- Heard you were busy.
More sponges!
- Major, heard you were back.
Baker, get back in here and help the colonel.
- Now I know you're back.
- Tell us about your honeymoon.
Just the dirty stuff.
Captains, please.
Mrs. Penobscott's feelings.
That's what we want to hear about.
Private Picetti X ray hot off the press.
Gloryosky, Sandy.
Do I behold the ravishing Mrs. Penobscott?
Yes, Klinger, I'm back.
So get moving.
Yes, Major Houlihan.
Never heard of anybody coming home early from a honeymoon.
They had to throw a bucket of water on me and the missus.
Did you have a good time?
Clamp.
Clamp.
We need more suction.
If you don't wanna tell us about your honeymoon, I understand.
- I appreciate that.
- But I hope you took pictures.
You know, Private, if you are very careful you can hit every pothole along the way.
Sorry, sir, but I've only got two hands.
Yes, I noticed that.
I'm a doctor.
How much more of this must my kidneys endure?
About 20 miles, sir.
Wonderful.
- What's happening?
- The enemy, sir.
Mortars.
The enemy?
Here?
Good God!
Turn right!
Right!
Left!
Left!
- Follow me, sir.
- Where?
- Take cover.
- When do they stop?
- When they hit something.
- Very comforting.
Hit the dirt!
Good Lord, what do we do now?
Sit tight, hold your breath and pray if you got 'em.
- What about the jeep?
- Don't worry about it, sir.
It's paid for.
Better stay put, Major.
Now we can go.
- How?
- A.T. A.T.?
Alternate transportation.
You're on your own now, sir.
I'm going back to headquarters.
Good luck to you.
Extra, "extrey," read all about it.
Latest news in the Stars And Stripes.
U.S. Enters war in Korea.
- Get your latest news right here.
- Excuse me.
It's a little shack in the compound marked "latrine".
- Immediate seating in the mezzanine.
- It isn't that.
- I want to ask you something.
- Go.
Are you a guy, or a hairy broad with a deep voice?
I'm all man, Clyde.
The clothes are a dodge.
- A what?
- If I keep wearing women's clothes maybe they'll give me a Section Eight and send me home.
- Oh.
How long you been at this?
- Two years, April 22.
- Oh, it's not just a dodge.
- What do you mean?
If you've been dressing like this for two years, you are a Section Eight.
- That's what I keep telling 'em.
- Let me tell 'em.
I'm a lawyer.
Captain Schaeffer.
Adjutant General Branch.
I'm telling you.
I can get you a discharge.
Captain, if you can help, I'm your slave.
- No problem.
- Oh, Captain, my Captain.
Set me free and for the rest of your life, I'll bring you belly dancers their navels stuffed with chopped liver.
You're perfect.
Hey, listen, Doc.
I'm sure there's something inside that you missed, huh?
It hurts right about here.
Comes with the territory.
That's our canned corned beef.
But, Doc, I don't wanna go back.
I can't say as I blame you.
Would you like to talk to Father Mulcahy?
Okay, but I'm an atheist.
- Really?
- Swear to God.
Uh, let's check Private Leland's chart.
How you feeling, Dr. Berman?
Critical.
I know you've got a chest tube in, and the lung's re-expanded.
I repaired the laceration of the ventricle, so there's a weak area in the myocardium.
In other words, a ventricular aneurysm.
- Yeah, it looks that way.
- So it's "Good night, Nurse".
You just rest and stabilize.
And, if necessary, we'll tackle the aneurysm.
You doctors are all alike.
- Did you tell him about the aneurysm?
- Yeah.
- Gonna try it?
- None of us have ever seen that operation.
- What are you gonna do?
- I think I'll hide in the woods till the war is over.
-  - I got it!
You got it!
I know I've got it.
Potter here.
Yeah, Sergeant.
Oh, not Burns again.
He was on this bus, and he sat down next to a Red Cross lady.
Tried to bite off her buttons.
He kept hollering, "Margaret!
Mar" Is that his wife?
No, just a well-built ship that crossed his wake.
Have you got him locked up?
Well, not exactly, sir.
You see, the lady screamed and the bus stopped, and he jumped out the window.
Look, Sergeant, do me a favor.
When you finally lasso him put him in a padded stall.
For your trouble Put this toward some shock absorbers.
- You staring at me, Corporal?
- Oh, no, sir.
No, I'm sorry, sir.
It's just we don't get too many strangers around here standing up.
Charming place.
An inflamed boil on the buttocks of the world.
What is that odor?
Uh, north wind, cesspool.
East wind, latrine.
- The wind is from the south.
- Oh, that's the kitchen.
Sir, are you the doctor we've been waiting for?
That's quite likely.
Major Charles Emerson Winchester, Surgeon.
Corporal Walter Eugene O'Reilly, Company Clerk.
- Shall I get your bag, sir?
- Of course.
Where will I find your commanding officer?
Uh, in his commanding office.
Uh, this way.
- Ooh, I'm sorry, sir.
Do you mind?
-  Not at all.
- Skoal.
- Anita Ekberg.
- Ingrid Bergman.
- Sonja "Heinie".
- Sir, this is Major Charles Emerson, uh - Winchester.
- Winchester.
- Radar, don't talk with your hands full.
- Welcome to MASH 4077, Doctor.
- Yup.
Drs.
Pierce, Hunnicutt.
- Hawkeye.
- Doctor.
- B.J. - Doctor.
Major, you have no idea how glad we are to see you.
This is our first break in 36 hours.
Have a snort.
- Thank you.
No.
- Got your papers, Winchester?
- Gee, what swell gloves.
- Calf.
Oh.
- Where you from, Charlie?
- Charles.
- Oh.
- We're pretty informal up here.
We get very close.
I don't intend to be here long enough to get chummy.
- Well, I'll drink to that.
- I'll join you.
Impressive, Doctor.
Harvard Med.
Massachusetts General.
What were you doing in Tokyo?
Demonstrating new surgical techniques.
- Up here, it's strictly meatball surgery.
- Patch 'em up and get 'em out.
That's rather primitive, isn't it?
We've got a 98% survival rate, cowboy.
- Charles.
- No offense intended, Colonel.
Offense accepted, Major.
And you can Look.
We're all a little tired.
Let's not get off on the wrong foot.
Colonel, I'm going to eat now, sir.
- What are they having, Radar?
- Breaded Spam cutlets.
- Every meal an adventure.
- Do the officers eat similar rations?
Yep.
We're all just one big, unhappy family.
- Don't we have a choice?
- Two.
Rosie's bar across the road or starvation.
Duncan Hines recommends the latter.
Colonel, Dr. Berman is going into heart failure.
He can hardly breathe.
- Let's go.
-  Ventricular aneurysm.
- Why the panic?
- Can you do anything about it?
- I've done at least a dozen.
- Successfully?
No offense intended, Major.
- Offense accepted.
- Let's hang out your shingle, Major.
More light on the heart.
That light flickers.
You gotta synchronize your blinks.
-  It's our number two generator.
- Switch to number one.
Number one was stolen by some locals.
It's now a taxicab in Pukch'ang.
- More suction.
-  Suction.
Thank you.
There's your aneurysm.
Now, the main difficulty here, gentlemen is that the aneurysm may have a clot in it.
If you don't do this very carefully it could break off and go to the brain.
Then it's "Good-bye, Charlie".
- Sorry.
Charles.
- So that's how you do this.
- You oversew the aneurysm.
- Mm-hmm.
Good work, Remington.
- Winchester.
- Oh, uh - Still with us, Hunnicutt.
- 100 over 70.
- Beautiful, Doctor.
-  Voila.
- Ready to close.
-  Fine work, Doctor.
Considering the circumstances, I would say extraordinary.
Major Winchester, sir, may I ask a question?
- You may.
- Could I stop by sometime for a cup of ego?
Wasn't that wonderful?
Such marvelous technique.
The whole family has gifted hands.
Mother's a concert pianist.
My dad can get an olive out of the bottom of a jar with one finger.
- And leave the pimento behind.
- Oh, yeah.
Frontline humor, I suppose.
Crude and boorish.
You gotta admit though, these jokers'll make you laugh.
Colonel, sir, I got Major Burns on the telephone.
- He's calling from Seoul.
- About time.
You coming, Margaret?
It's an obscene phone call.
- Crude and boorish.
- Crude and Boorish.
A great act.
- He plucked chickens.
- And she jumped through an awning.
Yeah, I understand, Sergeant.
Thank you.
Put him on.
Burns?
Not so fast.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
You are?
- What's up?
- I should have listened on my own phone.
Opportunity missed is an opportunity lost.
- Ralph Waldo Emerson.
- Writer of note.
- Writers of notes get famous?
- Please, I'm on long distance!
- Sorry, sir.
- Okay, Burns.
I'll take care of it.
Right, Major.
Right.
The same to you.
- What's the latest on Burns?
- This one's a doozy.
He saw an officer and a blonde walking down the main drag.
- And in his state - Bombed?
Boiled.
Mistook them for Penobscott and Houlihan.
Well, this couple went into a public bath, stripped down, got in the water.
A man and a lady in the same water?
- Baptists.
- Oh.
Frank jumps in with them, still in uniform.
Wow!
Grabbed the woman and started crying.
Suddenly, he realizes he's in the water with the wrong couple.
Mrs. Kester hollered bloody murder.
Wait a minute.
You mean Brigadier General and Mrs. Kester?
In the buff.
They're holding Burns for psychiatric observation.
Perfect!
And then hang onto your skivvies he's being transferred out of here.
- Transferred?
- Out of here?
You Frank is being transferred?
You mean for good?
- That's right.
- Holy cow.
They can't do that to us.
There's so much more we wanted to say to the fink.
And all of it rotten.
You realize this reduces the enemy to just North Korea.
This calls for a toast.
You too, Radar.
- Special occasion.
- Thank you, sir.
A toast.
What shall it be?
- Something tender.
- Something sentimental.
Right.
Good-bye, ferret face.
- Let's put it over here.
- Okay.
- What does he got in here?
- I don't know.
Ain't this the final kick in the butt?
We pack so Major Bonkers can get outta here.
Not an easy task.
Each object holds such unpleasant memories.
The laundry.
One pair of shorts, perfect condition.
Mine.
- One pair of shorts, holes, buttons missing.
- Frank's.
One pair of socks, perfect condition mine.
You're pretty quick with the socks, fella.
- One pair of socks, holes Frank's.
- Frank's.
- This is gonna be easier than I thought.
- Matter of having a system.
-  - Entrez- vous.
Colonel Potter said you were packing Frank's things.
There's something of mine I'd like back.
I don't think that's possible.
- Margaret, please.
We packed so carefully.
- I'll bet.
- May one ask what it is you're looking for?
- It's personal.
- The torn shorts are right on top.
- I'll slap you.
- Bully.
- Ah, here it is.
-  - This is none of your business.
- What is it?
- A picture of Margaret in a bikini.
- Let me see.
- No.
- Give you a nickel.
- No.
- Show you where the horse bit me.
- Not interested.
- Oh, come on.
How does she look?
- Beautiful.
A goddess.
- Really?
- Oh!
Yum!
Yum!
Yum!
- You're spitting on it.
- I'm gonna faint.
Margaret, put it back.
It'll keep him crazy.
Why torture him?
Frank wasn't all that bad.
- Compared to what?
- Well, he's no Donald Penobscott.
- Compared to what?
- Well, he's no Donald Penobscott.
In some ways, Donald is no Frank Burns.
- Uh, Margaret - Margaret, wait a second.
- Would you care to elaborate on that?
- No, I wouldn't.
Margaret.
Look, if you've got something you want to get off your chest - I promise you it won't go beyond this tent.
- Oh!
No, thank you.
I'd sooner tell Walter Winchell.
- Might make you feel better.
- Why should I trust you two?
Because we're all you've got.
Because we care.
- Come on, Margaret.
Have a drink.
- Come on.
Sit down.
You don't have to tell us if you don't want to.
But sit down.
You look upset.
- Have a drink.
- What'll it be, gin or gin?
- How's that?
-  -  - Terrible.
Thank you.
- Something went wrong, didn't it, Margaret?
- Your word of honor?
- Sure.
- What about him?
- Him too.
- Well the first two days were perfect.
Then after that, it was like being on a honeymoon with my old auntie.
What happened between the second and third day?
Nothing.
We were having a wonderful time tennis, shopping.
A lovely party that evening at General Weiskopf's.
- Lyle was a charming host.
- Lyle?
General Weiskopf.
He's an old friend.
We stayed up and talked and laughed until 3:00 in the morning.
Was the groom in the room?
Sure.
He was right there listening.
What happened after the party?
- Nothing.
- As in "nothing"?
He stopped talking.
He stopped smiling.
He stopped everything.
As in "everything"?
Well, Margaret, don't you think that's it?
- What?
- That's probably it.
Donald was competing with your whole past.
Some guys can't take that pressure.
The male libido can be a very fragile thing.
Oh, poor Donald.
Oh, he'll get over it.
It happens all the time.
Frank never had that problem.
- Frank didn't need it.
He had every other one.
- Oh, I know.
I know.
Frank Burns was a little too "by the book" for you guys, but I personally have some very fond memories of our friendship.
That dirty rat!
My alarm clock.
He said the bellboy took it.
That fink!
Margaret, remember the fond memories.
Oh, I'll give him a fond memory.
Bottoms up, Frank.
Schaeffer, this is none of your business.
Colonel, please, you're shouting at my lawyer.
You are holding a legitimate Section Eight here.
- Lay it on him, mouthpiece.
- A guy hanging onto a dodge this long is a legit psychotic, believe me.
Look, Captain, it doesn't matter.
Teddy Roosevelt had a transvestite in his outfit.
Rode sidesaddle up San Juan Hill.
- Is that true, Captain?
- Could be.
- They all wore such big hats.
- We're sunk.
Oh, no, we're not.
I'm preparing my client's brief for General Phelps.
-  - And, you, as my client do not talk to this man unless I am present.
- Sir, phone call from Tokyo General.
- Got it.
Come on, Klinger.
You and your lawyer, take a hike.
Colonel, I am going to convene a formal hearing on this.
Good.
Klinger, I suggest you wear your black sheath with pearls.
Basic black before 5:00?
Really.
Potter here.
Yes, of course I still need a new surgeon.
Who?
MacKenzie?
Look, Baldwin.
I've seen that clown's 201 file.
He's a boozer.
Chief engineer on the Red-nose Express.
Martinelli?
I've seen his surgery.
Let me give you a tip.
Sew his fingers together and make him a psychiatrist.
What about Winchester?
Yeah, I know he's temporary.
Make him permanent and it's a deal.
Good.
Oh, really?
I'll remember that.
- Radar, are you there?
- I was, sir, but now I'm in here, sir.
- Where's Winchester?
- He's getting ready to leave.
- I wanna talk to him pronto.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me back a Snickers bar.
- With nuts?
- No.
- Milky Way.
Damn partial.
Here we are, for your refreshment pleasure before we present the ravishing Boom Boom Goldfarb and a trained owl synthetic ice cream, synthetic sherbet, synthetic spumoni.
Each and every cup contains a $5,000 pair of Swiss binoculars.
Hey.
This offer limited time only.
Time's up.
Watch it, Mac.
Who wants melting ice cream?
But, Father, I don't want to go back anymore.
- Son, we all feel fear.
It's quite natural.
- But, Father Without fear, one would stand in traffic and get run over.
It's nature's way of protecting your life.
Father, it's not my life that I'm concerned about.
Excuse me?
I killed three people.
I saw their eyes.
Father, I just don't wanna kill anymore.
- Pierce?
- Chuck?
- Well, you're leaving.
What's in a name?
- How're you feeling?
Dr. Berman, this is Dr. Winchester.
He saved your life.
Thank you.
I thought I was a goner.
Yes, I can understand that.
I think I've just been insulted.
Very observant.
Blood pressure?
I can't believe it.
Dr. Pierce tells me that your technique was extraordinary.
To him, perhaps.
Well, I'm on my way.
Good luck, Dr. Berman.
- You're not on staff here?
- Oh-ho, no.
This was just a stopover in a stagnant backwater of the war.
- Gentlemen.
- Ta.
- I don't think he likes it here.
- I wonder why.
This time of year, we offer so much more than Monte Carlo ringworm, shingles, dysentery and at decent prices.
## Where is that blasted jeep?
Is this the best you've got?
I got some private stock, but it'll cost you a nickel more.
Oh, let's splurge.
Wow.
We don't get too many guys like you in here.
Yes, I'm painfully aware of that.
Make it two one for me, one for yourself.
What?
I wouldn't drink that.
I have a stomach and a family to think of.
Oh, I found I found him.
Major Winchester.
Uh, don't go away, sir.
The colonel wants to see you.
Colonel, I found Major Winchester.
Well, I hope he's succinct.
My jeep will be here momentarily.
- I do hate long good-byes.
- I found him.
- Oh, Winchester.
- Can we hurry this up?
I checked the O.R., the Mess Tent, the latrine, everywhere.
And then I come in here, the Officers Club, and here he was.
He was here.
His gear was here.
And then I was - Radar.
Radar.
Type that up in triplicate.
- Yes, sir.
I found him.
Well, it's very kind of you to see me off.
I would ask you to join me in a farewell drink, but there just isn't time.
Oh, we'll have plenty of time.
- Oh?
- I've got some good news, Major.
You're assigned to us permanently.
- Impossible.
- Orders are cut.
It's final.
No!
No.
Colonel Baldwin assured me this is just temporary.
Is this the same Colonel Baldwin who owes you $600?
-  Yes.
- Need I say more?
You mean to tell me that I have to stay here just because somebody owes me $672.17?
- That's ridiculous.
- Of course it's ridiculous.
- You're staying because I need you.
- And if I refuse?
You'll be making gravel at Leavenworth.
Comprende?
- Comprendo.
- Good.
- Comprendo.
- Good.
Well, Major Winchester, I can't tell you how happy I am you've decided to join us.
And remember, if you ever have a problem, feel free to stop in.
My tent flap is always open.
##  Attention, Corporal Klinger.
Report to Colonel Potter's office, on the double.
And bring your lawyer.
- Now that's what I call fast action.
- Let me do the talking.
You're the solicitor, Captain.
M.P.'s!
My own escort.
Klinger, you wonderful, crazy person, you're going home.
I can smell downtown Toledo now.
- Corporal Klinger and lawyer reporting, sir.
- New scarf?
- Sears, Honolulu.
- Nice.
- Post-debutante department.
- Sorry I missed your cotillion.
I expected other officers, Colonel.
A review board.
- Road apples, Private.
- Uh, Captain, Colonel.
- Private, Corporal.
- Private?
Well, tsk, caught again.
Hold it.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
I thought Button it.
Button it.
- Let him talk.
- You're my lawyer.
Your lawyer is a buck private, and he's no lawyer.
I beg your How's that?
According to his captain, a real captain Schaeffer here has been bucking for a Section Eight longer than you have.
- A loony?
- Busted twice done four months in the slammer, has impersonated a doctor a bombardier, a tank commander - even a chaplain.
- A chaplain.
At this very moment somewhere in America You shyster!
Why'd you lie to me, get my hopes up?
I thought you'd understand.
You're my own kind.
-  - They gonna send me home?
- I doubt it.
- I feel like crying.
Let it all out, stud.
He's all yours, boys.
Well, hang in there, Klinger.
I was an M.P. Once too.
Don't feel bad, son.
Guy's a real pro.
You'll make it someday.
- You think so, sir?
- Absolutely.
Never say die.
You're a real inspiration, sir.
Sir?
Sir, Major Burns is on the phone.
- He says he wants to talk to you and B.J. - I'm busy.
He says it's the last time he'll ever talk to you.
I can't pass that up.
Take care, Doc.
B.J. Hey, thanks, Hawkeye.
Don't go around condemning yourself.
Always get two doctors' opinions.
What's that you said, Charles?
How we doing?
Oh, we're doing fine.
Thank you.
How you doing?
Oh, really?
Well, you'll get used to it.
- He'll talk your ear off.
- Seems a bit cold.
He's got great hands.
Can hit to right field, but no heart.
- You'll soften him up.
- I doubt it.
He takes two arrogant pills after every meal.
Let's go.
Yes, Frank, yes.
We packed everything.
He wants to know if we folded his underwear.
And we ironed your pleats.
What?
He wants to talk to you.
Yes, Frank.
You what?
Uh, Frank, we both think that's wonderful.
Yeah.
Frank, we're proud to have known you.
Yeah.
Best of luck in your future, Frank.
Bye, Frank.
Hey, come on!
I'm responsible for that!
You seem a trifle irked.
The army, in its infinite wisdom has not only cleared Frank of the charges they have assigned him to a veterans hospital in Indiana and promoted him to lieutenant colonel.
- Oh, no, no, no no!
- I was just gonna complain to my congressman.
Yeah?
No, no!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Ah!
O'Reilly, just the man I want to see.
- Me?
- Is there anyone else in this room?
- No.
- Then it must be you.
- Get me Tokyo General Hospital.
- On the phone?
No, open the window and yell.
Take that bag of phone and do whatever voodoo you do and get me Colonel Baldwin.
That won't do you any good, sir.
You're staying.
You pusillanimous little squirt.
Don't you dare to tell me I'm staying!
- You get on that phone!
- But I can't, it's - No buts.
You start cranking.
- Yes, sir.
I'm cranking.
I am.
I'm cranking.
But it's broken.
Somebody madder than you got to it first.
Corporal, I assure you.
Nobody in Korea is madder than me.
I'll take your word for it, sir.
- Corporal, fix the phone!
- Fix it.
Okay.
- I don't care how.
What I care is when.
- No, I'll fix it.
- And the when is now.
- Yes, okay.
Right.
Because if you don't, I am going to Winchester, you're not going anywhere.
Colonel, l  I think I should tell you that my father knows Harry Truman.
He doesn't like him, but he knows him.
Fine.
You have Dad call Harry then Harry'll call me, and maybe we'll work something out.
In the meantime, vamoose.
All right, Colonel, I am vamoosing.
But know this.
You can cut me off from the civilized world.
You can incarcerate me with two moronic cell mates.
You can torture me with your thrice-daily swill.
But you cannot break the spirit of a Winchester.
My voice shall be heard from this wilderness and I shall be delivered from this fetid and festering sewer.
I think he's getting the hang of this place.
Ah!
Over there.
Oh.
Hello.
- Oh.
Hello.
- How are you?
- Who's this?
- Dollar a day.
Funny name for a Korean.
Oh, goody, you found it.
You actually wear that?
Sure.
When I'm operating on pilots.
- Contact.
- Contact.
Keep the air force on your side of the room.
Attention, all personnel.
All those with body lice, report for dusting at 1330 hours.
Dysentery at 1420 hours.
Toe fungus at 1500.
Good Lord, what sort of a pesthole have I fallen into?
You'll get used to it.
The pests grow on you.
E-E-Easy!
A little to the left.
Now you got it.
- Where do you want this, Doc?
- In Tokyo, actually.
Tempo, Doc.
I got a lice appointment.
- Set it down anywhere.
- Over here.
Thank you much.
Dismissed.
- Nice hat, Klinger.
New?
- For tea dancing.
Who is that creature?
Corporal Klinger first man to kill a caribou with a beaded purse.
- Finish!
- You have not done the corners.
- Finish!
- You haven't made my bed.
Finish.
Why me?
Why me?
Practically chief of thoracic surgery at Boston General in this godforsaken dump.
Me.
A man who can hum all four parts of the Schubert string quartets - and quote Spinoza from memory.
- Well, that's the army.
- You know, supply and demand.
- That's why you were picked.
Just yesterday we were saying we were short a Spinoza man.
- I'm a leg man, myself.
- And very funny.
Remind me to slap my knee.
Attention, all personnel.
MASH 8063 is overloaded.
Their casualties are on the way.
- That's us, Charlie.
- Let's go.
It's Howdy Doody time.
-  Come on, Chuckles, shake it.
- Let's go.
- Are you speaking to me?
- What's taking you so long?
In this camp, cleanliness is next to impossible.
You have to kill the germs.
Don't hang around for the funeral.
Look how high he's scrubbing.
Maybe he's going to operate in evening gloves.
Gentlemen, I do one thing at a time.
I do it very well, and then I move on.
Can you doctors wiggle your collective keister?
I've got three tables facing the war.
One of them is a tricky bowel resection.
B.J. Or I will take it.
Dr. Pasteur is still pasteurizing himself.
Well, uh, maybe we'd better wait and let him do it.
It's kind of complicated.
As soon as you can, Winchester.
- All right.
- What's so great about him?
I do one thing at a time.
I do it very well and then I move on.
Gentlemen, please pay close attention to this bowel resection.
I don't want to have to show it to you twice.
I'm not gonna play second scalpel to this garbanzo for the rest of the war.
Why don't we avoid the Christmas rush and start hating him now?
-  Done.
-  Klinger!
Take him to post-op.
Leave in the I.V.
This kid's running up an awful big tab.
He's on Diners Club.
I'll take this guy.
Let me see that X ray, please.
Shattered patella.
Put him to sleep.
We're kind of falling behind, Colonel.
- Winchester.
- Oh, really?
- Can I help?
- Is there a prayer for my varicose veins?
Well, there's a mailman's prayer that might be effective.
Really sell it, Padre.
Next patient.
We're two up on you, Winchester.
Shift into high gear.
I refuse to rush through a bowel resection.
This is the rush hour, Major.
Better get in the fast lane.
Sponge.
For your information, I'm doing meticulous work.
Neatness don't count in meatball surgery.
Is harassment standard operating procedure?
Page 26 of the surgeon songbook.
Another ambulance just pulled in.
Eleven wounded.
Really bad.
Holy Moly.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Father.
- More?
Why do people always wait till the last minute to get shot?
-  - Major, we can't spend two hours on a bowel resection.
Charles, move on!
I'm moving on as fast as I can.
I'm finished here, Charlie.
Let me show you.
You show me?
Certainly not.
-  Doctor, we do have shortcuts.
- Shortcuts are sloppy surgery.
- More suction.
- Doctor, if we can't control the bleeding, we're gonna lose him.
- B.J., take over.
Winchester, watch him.
-  Move it.
- Now see here.
- Wounded egos come later.
For now, just watch.
- Two big clamps.
-  Another customer.
I'll take him.
Give him a magazine.
I'll be right there.
When you're in a hurry, cut the mesentery between two big clamps - and forget daintiness.
- Throw in a layer of catgut and interrupted silk in the serosa.
Maybe eight sutures on the anterior side.
Mucosa to mucosa, muscularis to muscularis.
- Serosa to serosa.
- And Natchez to Mobile.
- It'll leak.
- No, it won't, and it'll only take 20 minutes.
Klinger, let me see that X ray again.
It's me again.
Klinger had to, uh, uh Oh, to be in the latrine, now that spring is here.
Winchester, don't feel so bad.
You'll catch on.
I felt like an intern in there.
Everybody does in the beginning.
First thousand patients are the hardest.
Second day, it gets easier.
I don't I don't think I can adjust to this.
Look.
We know you're a good surgeon.
Even though some good surgeons wash out under these conditions, you won't.
- You're gonna make it.
- Sure you will.
We're not any better than you.
It's just that by sheer repetition, we've gotten fast.
Well you may be right.
If you people did it, I certainly can.
Way to go, Charlie.
Come on over to my office.
We'll have a couple of belts.
Thank you, no.
If you don't mind, uh I'd rather be alone.
That is not a happy person.
Would you rather have Burns?
- He was more fun to be cruel to.
- Do me a favor.
No practical jokes, no horsing around until he gets broken in.
Okay?
I wish you told us that before we put the snake in his bed.
##   Hey, we got us a new record player.
Please, Beej, Mozart.
Have you no respect for classical music?
Are you kidding?
I got the "William Tell Overture" - by Spike Jones.
- Oh.
##  Clever.
Very clever.
Please Mozart.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Oh, Lieutenant, your journal came.
Radar, you have anything for me?
Do l Well, l-l - Hi.
- Radar.
- Do I have - Did I get a letter?
Oh, no.
I don't think so.
But if I may say, that's a very nice towel you're wearing, Lieutenant.
Look at this, you dodo.
You're standin' here talkin' to yourself.
Jerk.
- Mail call.
- Sensational.
Anything in a blue envelope, smells as though it was written by a girl in a summer dress a spray of lilac at her elbow?
You got a letter from your congressman that the mail truck threw into Colonel Potter's corral by mistake.
- I think I'll pass.
- I'll take anything from my family, no matter how it smells.
- It smells like crayons.
- You sure it's not from my congressman?
Hey, Radar, what's up?
You look down.
Well, to tell you the truth Can I talk to you guys?
- To tell you the truth, why not?
- Pull up a bunk.
Hey, thanks.
Um Well, I'm very concerned about something which concerns my life here.
- What's the trouble, Andy?
- Well I don't think that this place is turning out to be that great an experience for me.
I work under terrible pressures, and there's lots of death and destruction and stuff but other than that, I don't think I'm getting much out of it.
I knew there was something wrong with this place.
I mean, the army's supposed to It's Well, it's supposed to make a man out of you, isn't it?
It depends which sex you are to start with.
You have to meet them halfway.
I'm just basically the same person that I was, that I came in with.
You think you could've run an outfit this big before you came over here?
- That's just being a good clerk.
- What would you rather be?
- Okay.
Now, listen.
This is just, uh, talk.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I mean, it's just sort of thinkin' out loud.
- Yeah, right.
- What do you want to be?
- Oh.
A hot lover.
Or even a cold one, I don't care.
What makes you think the army can help?
When my Uncle Ed came home from World War I his mother could tell by the look in his eyes that he hadn't been a good boy in France.
She cried for three days.
I just know when I go home, my mother's gonna take one look at me and chuckle for a week.
Radar, you're working yourself into a froth over nothing.
Oh, nothing, huh?
Look, it's not such a big deal.
Write yourself a weekend pass borrow a Jeep and go down to the Pink Pagoda in Seoul.
Find some nice lady who reminds you of your father and let nature take its course.
You mean, go to the Pink Pagoda in Seoul, make friends with a lady and let nature take its course?
Well, that's another way of putting it, yes.
Maybe you're not cut out for a life of depravity.
Stick to sniffing letters.
Yeah, but I'm the only one that's gonna leave this place younger than I was when I came.
So go to Seoul.
Get it over with.
Y-You mean actually go to Seoul and you know?
A little "you know" never hurt anybody.
Some of our greatest presidents did "you know".
Let him wait till he's elected.
Don't rush him.
- Who's rushing him?
He's over 12.
- Radar, relax.
- When the time is right, you'll go.
- Your glasses are fogging.
Go.
Okay.
Okay, I will.
Next week.
Now!
Okay.
Okay.
Now.
You know something?
I feel different already.
I think I'm getting a fever.
Hey, any of you guys from Iowa?
Yeah.
You headed that way?
Oh, no, I'm going into Seoul to, uh - I'm, uh  I'm just goin' into Seoul.
- I wish I was.
It's been so long since I've been to Seoul to, uh  Hardly know what it's like anymore.
- Right.
-   I want X rays here pelvis and lumbar areas.
All right, this guy can wait.
Let me look at this other man over here.
-  All right.
Come on.
Get him in here!
- Shoulder wounds.
Uh, get some plasma.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Let me look at his chest.
- B.J!
- Coming, Mother.
B.J., it's Radar!
Oh, my God.
- What did I do to him?
- You didn't do anything to him.
- He was hit by mortar fire.
- Is his chest all right?
I don't know.
We'll have to look around in there.
Get him in there and prep him.
What a stupid thing!
I sent him through the middle of a war on a date.
- Come on.
Let's check the rest of these guys.
- Could've killed him!
What the hell was he doing out there in a Jeep anyway?
What a waste.
I'll go in and see how bad it is as soon as they get him to sleep.
- I'm gonna work on him.
- Why don't you let B.J.?
You don't look that relaxed.
I'm working on him!
Okay, fine.
Can I have it quiet?
I'm trying to operate.
Right.
We're just carving turkeys.
- Shut up, Charles.
- Are you gonna keep us in suspense or you gonna tell us how he's doin'?
It's not as bad as it looked.
There's a lot of muscle damage, but the vital organs are okay.
So why, may I ask, are we being treated to this inordinate demand for silence?
I'll explain later, Charles, while I'm sitting on your chest - so Hawkeye can beat you with both fists.
- Criminy!
Will you guys cork it?
We're up to our ankles in wit.
Innkeeper, buy everybody a drink.
It's on me.
There's no everybody left, Hawk.
My My swallower's gone back to camp.
- Nothing but a fickle camp swallower.
-  - You did great.
- Yeah.
No, really.
You did great.
He'll run like a new model in a few weeks.
- I thought I killed him, you know?
- I know.
- He's such a cute little guy, you know?
- Yeah.
You know that my hands were shaking?
I had butterflies.
I've held people's hearts in my hand, and with him I was nervous.
- Am I boring you?
- I've heard this four times already.
- I know how it ends.
- How does it end?
I wasn't here for the early show.
You start crying and sing "Somewhere over the Rainbow".
Can we go home?
#If funny little bluebirds fly Away above the sky so high # #Then why, oh, why Oh, why, oh, why ## - Will you shut him up?
- Sh-Shh.
That's the third time tonight he's awakened me with that idiotic song!
Oh, really?
Oh, really?
That happens to be the national anthem of Iowa from where comes Judy Garland, the Tin Man and Radar O'Reilly!
I think you will find that the characters lurching through your febrile mind come from Kansas.
- Wake me up early.
I want to check Radar in post-op.
- I'll check Radar.
You sleep it off.
Unclench your toe!
And clench your mouth.
Clench yours, you hairless parsnip!
Rise and shine, folks.
Incoming on the helipad.
All personnel, grab your socks.
I think we better let him sleep.
The man said "all personnel".
Charles, he's only been asleep for two hours.
You know his body hasn't had time to detoxify.
His body should have thought of that last night.
- Rise and shine, glue brains.
-  What?
- What?
- Surgery, Hawk.
Good.
Have my brain removed.
Sleep.
If things get rough, I'll send for you.
Oh, no.
Colonel Potter's not gonna rush me in my work just so he can sleep off a gallon of hooch.
Don't yell!
- Stay here and sleep, Hawk.
- I'll do my share.
- Is this my shoe?
- That's your pants.
Good.
Where do they go?
- In your case, over your head.
-  Really, Charles, if that weren't so amusing, one might laugh.
-  - Not over here.
Well, who's next?
I'm nearly finished.
We're real proud of you, speedy.
Wipe.
-  How's it going, Hawk?
- I can't talk.
I'm operating.
- Oh, where is the badinage of yesteryear?
- Shut your hole, Charles!
- What's eating him now?
- This breakfast session caught us a little off guard.
Aren't you over here on the American plan?
Heh!
Well said, Colonel.
- Pertinent and pithy persiflage.
- Oh, pooh pooh pa-doo.
- Who's got free hands?
- What's the matter?
I need somebody to suture this mesentery while I step outside for a minute.
Hold it in.
Stand on one foot like the rest of us.
- Charles, are you free?
- Yes, but I don't see why this should come off my time.
You know why just as well as I do.
Have a little heart.
Winchester, get your persiflage over there.
Pierce, go out and come in again.
Let's get on with this.
If you'll excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, with your very kind permission I'm gonna, uh - What is it with him?
- We got home kind of late last night.
Well, kind of late this morning.
And you think he poisoned himself on the hors d'oeuvres at Rosie's bar.
- Well, that's just dandy!
- Colonel, you know nothing like this has ever happened before.
It better not be happening now!
Baker!
Tell Pierce to get back here tout de suite!
- He's a little indisposed right now, Colonel.
- Indisposed?
He's laying over an oil drum throwing up.
Well, well, well.
How the mighty have fallen.
## Look, you can walk around with your brains at half-mast 24 hours a day for all I care but when that chopper hits the pad I expect you to be able to tie a slipknot in a matchbox.
-  - It's incomprehensible to me that a surgeon of your caliber would walk into an operating room with a bag on.
Okay, let's hear some talk.
What's your explanation?
I screwed up.
- I presume it won't happen again.
- That's right.
Well, this little talk has been terribly reassuring.
God, I hate this place.
You seemed to be enjoying it well enough last night.
I thought I was celebrating, but I was really drinking in anger.
Every time I thought of Radar lying on that table with his chest laid open in front of me I socked another shot into my body.
'Cause I didn't have anyone else's body to sock.
Have you seen him today?
He's doin' great.
I'll go in there when I can screw a smile on my face.
I'll lend you one of mine.
Got a drawer full of 'em.
So that's your secret.
I can't tell you what a jerk I feel like.
Listen, anybody'd feel like a jerk if they'd done what you did.
- Thanks.
That really perks me up.
- That's all right.
- Hiya, kid.
- Hey, Klinger.
Gee, you look nice.
Yeah, I don't get to wear this suit much and it took me hours gettin' the darts out.
Here, I brought you some flowers.
Oh, I didn't know cornflowers was bloomin' yet.
They're not.
I got 'em off of one of my hats.
Don't put 'em in water.
The color'll run.
- Oh.
Thanks a lot.
- Sure.
So, listen, what'd they say?
Is everything gonna work right and everything?
Well, uh, B.J. was by before, and Major Winchester.
They said I was gonna be all right.
Has Hawkeye been around to check you over yet?
No, not yet.
He's feeling a little out of sorts.
Yeah, so I hear.
Well, well, well, what have we here?
- Listen.
I'll see ya, okay?
- Right.
Thanks a lot, Klinger.
Radar, I told you a hundred times never go driving in Korea without a steel parasol.
You're gonna be fine.
I even put a little extra muscle in your arm so you'd look good at the beach.
How long am I gonna be laid up, sir?
"Sir"?
Aren't we being kind of formal?
I mean, after all, I did walk barefoot through your pectorals.
- Can you do that?
- Yeah.
Oh, good.
I hear you had to leave the O.R.
This morning.
That's right.
I did.
Somebody said you had to go outside to throw up.
- That's right.
- How come?
I've always wanted to barf on Ouijongbu, and I just thought the time was ripe.
It wouldn't be anything else, would it?
No, unless it was the fact that most of my blood came out of a scotch bottle.
I wouldn't know about that.
I'm not a doctor.
But I am, so I'm not allowed to be human.
Is that it?
You walked out on a patient - and Major Winchester had to finish for you.
- So?
I'd have done the same for him if he was sick.
Well, a lot of people don't look at it like you were sick, Hawkeye.
A lot of people look up to you here.
They admire you and they kind of feel like they want to be like you.
And, gee, when you walk out on an operation well, they kind of feel like you let 'em down.
And if they can't depend on you well, they figure, well, maybe there's no point in depending on anything.
Look, you can't lay all that on my shoulders.
Don't you know how much this place stinks?
Don't you know what it's like to stand day after day in blood?
In the blood of children?
I hate this place.
And if I can't stand up to it to your satisfaction then, then the hell with it.
How dare you?
The hell with your Iowa naivete and the hell with your hero worship and your teddy bear and while you're at it, the hell with you!
Why don't you grow up for crying out loud?
I'm not here for you to admire!
I'm here to pull bodies out of a sausage grinder if possible, without going crazy.
Period!
Come on.
Cut it out.
Stop it, will ya?
You ninny!
I don't know how it happened.
One minute we're talking, and the next minute I'm standing there watching this crazy man scream at Radar.
- Why don't you go back and talk to him again?
- I don't think I can face him.
- I can't believe I did it.
-  - Hello?
- Come in, Father.
I wonder if I might, uh, uh Have a seat, Father.
I just left Radar.
Now Hawkeye, please accept this in the spirit intended.
You're under enormous pressure here and l-I just want to know one little thing.
Have you lost your mind?
Father, you don't know how sorry I am.
I mean th-that boy is lying there in a hospital bed with tubes sticking out of his body and you, you call him a ninny?
Father I'm incensed!
I'm outraged!
Wh-Where's your decency, man?
Y-Your humanity?
I'm acrimonious!
- Father - I'm not a man given to physical demonstrations of emotion but let me tell you, I am persuaded to violence.
- Go ahead, Father.
- Well, I think I will!
I'm glad you let it out, Father.
Well, as a matter of fact I found it particularly unsatisfying.
And if you want to know the truth, it's entirely possible I've broken my toe!
Gee, you have a marvelous effect on people.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Are you nuts?
- I think I must be, yes.
- I think you are.
I no sooner give you a lecture on one patient than you go in and try to destroy another!
Maybe we should aim you at the Chinese.
- I'd like to talk to you.
- This ought to be good.
- What is the matter with you?
- Just a minute, Major.
- I have something to say on that subject - Hang on.
You'll get your turn!
I'll get my turn?
I'm the commanding officer.
- I beg your pardon, Colonel.
Go right ahead.
- Thank you.
Your behavior is incomprehensible again!
You have a boy there, fresh out of the cornfield who is highly vulnerable and impressionable - not to mention the fact that he worships you - Although why, I can't see!
And you make this kid the target of the most bellicose barrelful of Bull Durham - anybody's ever heard you utter.
- And I, for one, have heard you utter plenty!
If you don't mind, I rehearsed this as a single.
And you're doing fine.
Really.
Gee, Major, I appreciate that.
Now will you clam up?
This boy's been told he's nothing more than a pimple on a flea by the man whose opinion he values more than anyone in the world!
And I think you damn well better do something about it!
- Now what do you think?
- I think you're right.
Wha I never got to say anything!
- How's Radar doing?
- He's doing fine.
You're not gonna talk to him again, are ya?
I just want to sit with him for a minute.
I feel awful.
He's so fragile, you know?
Radar, I'd like to apologize.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can just forget it.
Just forget it!
Hell with me, huh?
The hell with you!
How 'bout that?
And another thing.
I wanna tell you something.
Anybody says anything about Iowa better be prepared to back it up, pal!
I'll give you a fistful of Iowa "naiveteness" right in the puss!
- How about that?
- No, let him go.
You know, I don't need you to tell me what's what.
I know what's what just as well as you do.
So why don't you just crawl back in your bottle of booze and pickle yourself?
Well, sitting with all your friends, I see.
Gee, Charles, you were the one person I was counting on for a little compassion.
This may come as a surprise to you, but I really do feel for you.
- Yeah?
- My, yes, I certainly do.
A very painful episode for a surgeon of your expertise to endure.
Actually, you know, I had a similar experience once myself.
A little, uh, peccadillo backfired nearly got me thrown out of school.
Of course, I was 14 at the time.
I wasn't a grown man like you are.
Doctor, do try to learn a little self-discipline.
I'm working on it right now.
Oh.
How's everything going here?
Oh, sir, I was just thinking about you.
I was going over the duty roster in my head.
If I had some paper, I could get it out for ya.
Oh, that's okay, Radar.
Rest your roster.
Klinger will work on it.
I understand you and Hawkeye had a little to-do.
Yes, sir.
- He's very fond of you, Radar.
- Oh, really, sir?
You know, they say time heals all wounds.
It's true.
Look, next week when you're up and walking around, you may run into Hawkeye and you'll probably start talking about the weather, or the food, or something.
Before you know it, you might realize he's the same guy you always liked when you looked up to him.
In fact, you might even like him better now that you can see him more eye to eye, if you know what I mean.
Oh, I know what you're trying to say, sir.
Well, good.
We'll see.
Hawkeye, long time no see, you know?
Yeah, I've been staying away from the firewater, Rosie.
- You got trouble with your liver?
- No.
Hi, Rosie.
Hi, Radar.
- Sit.
- Okay, thanks.
- Grape Nehi?
- Uh, yeah, I guess so.
- Uh, Hawkeye?
- A beer, I guess, Rosie.
Okay.
Hi, sailor, you come here often?
- Oh, hi.
- Mmm.
Sure is some stretch of warm weather we're havin'.
Yeah.
It, uh, really has been warm.
It's been, uh, very warm.
Yeah.
Did you try that breakfast this morning?
The, uh, sausages were ice cold.
Yeah, I heard about that.
I just usually give them a sniff, you know?
But, uh, I, I heard they were really cold.
- Yeah, they were really - Cold.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
Sure is some stretch of weather.
- Warm.
- Yeah.
Oy.
Look, I'd like to say I'm sorry.
This whole thing probably never would've happened if I wasn't so guilty about getting you wounded in the first place.
Well, gee, that wasn't your fault.
And if you really have to worship the ground I walk on, I guess I can take it.
Well, that's okay.
Um, I'd just as soon not.
Well, okay.
That's nice too.
One grape Nehi.
One beer.
##  - Hey, Radar, it's not your birthday, is it?
- No, why?
You just got some costume jewelry from President Truman.
- I think he's sweet on you.
- Huh?
- Okay if I nail that on?
- Hey!
- That's a Purple Heart.
- Oh, good, I hate it when presidents get fresh.
Wow, a citation.
I wonder what my mom's gonna say.
She'll probably say her boy has changed over here.
- And she'll be right.
- Yeah, I guess so.
You still gonna talk to us now that you're a hero and everything?
Oh, sure.
I still talk to ordinary people.
Radar, I'm gonna do something now I've hardly ever done before.
- You're not gonna kiss me, are ya?
- Mm-mmm.
-  Thank you, sir.
- Don't get hurt again, will ya?
That's probably what my mom will say.

- Somebody put "X" before "W".
- I did.
- Why?
- I lost my head in the heat of battle.
-  - I got it!
Beatcha!
MASH 4077.
Colonel Potter.
Yes.
I'm the C.O. What?
Well, that's impossible.
There must be some mistake.
I've seen the man work.
I can assure you, Colonel there is no need for an investigation.
Very well.
If you insist.
It's none of my business, sir, but your lips are turning white.
Provost marshal's office.
They're sending a colonel up here to investigate B.J. - Wow!
- Claim he's an impostor, not a doctor.
Ooh!
He took some blood out of my arm the other day.
Radar, the man's a doctor.
Whoa, Habibi!
Easy!
Easy, Habibi!
Whoa, Habibi!
Easy!
Easy, Habibi!
- Don't bump your humps.
- What do you want?
Bad timing, my faithful camel.
- Camel, my butt.
-  Isn't she a magnificent beast?
A two-humper.
Easy.
Easy.
Whoa, Habibi.
Whoa.
Stop that!
Sorry, sir.
High-spirited camels spit.
- Why is it Tuesdays are always the worst?
- Isn't she a beauty, sir?
Those gleaming yellow teeth, set against her brown camel-hair coat.
Klinger, I'm gonna write home to my mom about this one.
With Habibi's permission, oh "bespeckled" one of the pale flesh.
Look at her, Colonel.
Gracious transportation with economy.
A thousand miles per hump.
- Klinger, I got a big problem.
Now blow.
- As you command, sahib.
Come, oh faithful ship of the desert.
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
I can hear the call of the oasis now.
Sir, I know there was no camel in here, but there's a smell.
Lebanese aftershave.
- Two trays, Klinger?
- One for me and one for my camel, Habibi.
Oh.
Is your camel with you?
Right at my side.
I surmised that was the case.
Klinger, can I make a personal observation?
Sure.
Oh!
Cease!
Stop curling your lips.
You'll get your potatoes.
If you'd take all the energy you devote to these discharge schemes and put it into prayer the war would be over and you'd be home.
My Toledo priest is working on that.
Hold the meat loaf.
A camel is not a carnivore.
No spitting.
Watch the spitting.
Ah, tapioca!
But if you want the finest tapioca in the world, get thee to a nunnery.
So why don't I drop over to your tent around 9:30 tonight?
I'll bring a canteen of gin and some Fig Newtons and, uh, we'll, uh - Cheese it, the cops.
- Hawkeye.
- Father.
- Jennifer.
- Father.
- Don't let me interrupt.
- Oh, no.
Nothing important.
We were discussing the ups and downs of doctor/nurse relationships.
- Always the professional.
- Oh, yeah.
- Sir, can I eat?
It's meat loaf.
- Enjoy the mystery.
- Hawkeye, where's B.J.?
- Am I my doctor's keeper?
I've got to see him.
Something very important.
- What's up?
- There's a provost marshal coming here.
He's going to investigate B.J. Claims he's an impostor, not a doctor.
I could have told you that.
He's a piano player in a bawdy house.
- Wild talk today.
- Your tapioca's blushing.
I told this colonel it's crazy, but they're still investigating.
- Who's investigating?
- The provost marshal.
- Who?
Me?
- You.
- Say you're not a doctor.
- Shucks, I knew they'd find out.
- Excuse me.
- Don't go.
After B.J. Exposes himself - there's gonna be dancing.
- Oh, sure.
- It goes on and on.
- I think he's a spy.
- Are you a spy?
- I'm not allowed to say.
Pierce, I've had a bad day.
What league are the Brooklyn Dodgers in?
- League of Women Voters.
- So far he's right.
Who got down on one knee and sang "Mammy"?
- Father Mulcahy.
- Right again.
I prefer to observe rather than participate in this.
Colonel Potter, I must talk to you right away.
- Is it medical?
- No, it's personal.
- Not now, Major.
- It's important!
It's always important!
When's the last time I came to you?
I ask so little.
- And she gives so much.
- You stay out of this!
- I'm out!
I'm out!
- Please, Colonel, I must see you right away.
All right.
In my office in half an hour.
The army has no gratitude.
- Talk to the owners.
- Listen, you guys, serious up.
That colonel will be here this afternoon.
Come on.
This is ridiculous.
The army has all my credentials Acme Medical School.
Residency at Joe's Hospital and Auto Supply.
And then there's my practice at Schultz's Mortuary.
I know all that, but this Colonel What's-his-name Bardonaro sounded pretty sure of himself.
W-Wait a minute.
Is that Leo Bardonaro?
- That's the bird.
-  The spy laughed, refusing both cigarette and blindfold.
Leo Bardonaro is an old friend of mine from Stanford.
Stationed not far from here.
He lives for practical jokes.
I knew there had to be a herring in the pickle barrel.
This whole bit must be his way of saying he's gonna come see me this afternoon.
- You're not a spy?
- Sorry.
You've ruined my whole evening.
I was gonna take a date to your execution.
-  - Yeah.
You gotta watch out for this guy.
You never know what he's gonna do.
He was best man at my wedding.
Formal occasion, so he wore a white towel and black tie.
- No carnation?
- My honeymoon, he put a lizard in my alligator bag.
- So your bag wouldn't be lonely.
- Naturally.
Yo, B.J.!
- Leo!
Hey, how you doing?
- Great.
Great.
Good to see you.
Leo Bardonaro, Hawkeye Pierce.
Uh Just checking for a hand buzzer.
Oh, come on.
Kid stuff.
No imagination.
Hey, listen.
You really had our C.O. Going crazy earlier.
Really?
That's great.
- How 'bout a belt?
- Uh, did he make it?
No, no, no.
I manufacture.
He's just a shipping clerk.
- Oh, good.
Cigar?
- No, thanks.
- Oh.
B.J.?
- Sure.
What, are you crazy?
It's probably loaded.
Kid stuff.
We gave that up 10 years ago.
Our practical jokes are creative.
We don't put bombs in cigars.
It spoils the taste.
I'll take that one.
- Eh - Here.
Gimme that.
Here.
Hey, remember that time in the dean's office?
Mmm!
One time One time we stole a taxicab.
Took it apart completely and put it back together in the dean's office.
- With the meter running, I hope.
- Ran it up to 800 bucks.
Mm.
What do you call this stuff?
- Old underwear.
- Strained through G.I. skivvies.
- Terrific.
- Leo, what brings you up to the boonies?
- I'm goin' home.
-  Hey, I had to say good-bye.
Got my orders in my jacket.
I'm heading stateside.
- You dog.
I would give anything to go home.
- What, are you homesick?
He cries himself to sleep so often, he's gotta wear water wings to bed.
It's lucky you bunk with a guy that's got a sense of humor.
He's serious.
Hey, I got a plane to catch.
What time is it?
- It's 1:30.
- 1:30.
Bye.
Wait a sec.
You just got here.
Well, listen.
I gotta cut it short.
If you're ever in America, be sure and look me up.
I'm in the book.
- Where do you live?
- What Where do I live?
Philly.
My father's in Crabapple Cove, Maine.
Would you call him, Leo?
Why?
Is his name Leo too?
No jokes.
Just tell him I'm fine, and I'm happy he's not here.
Glad to do it.
Sure.
Hey, B.J. - Hey, Leo.
All right, buddy.
- Take care of yourself.
-  - I'll call Peg as soon as we land in Frisco.
- Would you?
I'd appreciate that.
- I couldn't resist the provost marshal bit.
- No problem.
No problem.
- Sorry, fella.
- Hawkeye, it's been a pleasure.
- Me too.
-  -  Bye.
Yo!
He gotcha!
He gotcha!
-  -   Oh, he gotcha!
But I must get to Tokyo.
I must see Donald!
- No, I can't spare you.
- Three days!
Nope.
- Colonel, may I be clinical?
- Shoot.
It's important for Donald's morale and personal well-being.
You see, Donald is a man, and you know how men are.
You've been away from Mrs. Potter a long time.
Surely, you must feel yearnings.
Yeah, she does make a hell of a raisin cupcake.
You've forgotten what it's like to be young!
Listen, missy, I don't take those cold showers just 'cause I'm dirty.
Well, then you do understand.
I mean, Donald is very virile.
- Here's the supply record.
- Will you butt out!
This is man talk!
I'm sorry, sir!
Colonel, please, let me put it another way.
- How's he doing?
- His vital signs still aren't stable.
Give him another unit of plasma and continue I.V.s as ordered.
Uh, Captain Hunnicutt?
The tall chap in the bowling shoes.
I know who he is.
These M.P.s wanna see him.
B.J., didn't you see the No Parking sign by the latrine?
I only stopped to mail a letter.
I only stopped to mail a letter.
- Captain Hunnicutt?
- The same.
We're from the provost marshal, and I'm sorry to say you're under arrest, sir.
Bardonaro again.
- His way of saying good-bye?
- Probably.
Look, uh, Sergeant.
This is all a big joke.
I'm very busy.
- We've got a lot of people to tend to here.
- Captain, this is no joke.
Here's the arrest order.
By order of Major General Fox?
Who's Fox?
Short, red-haired guy with the long nose, steals chickens.
I'm afraid you'll have to come along, Captain.
- Oh, bull!
- Now, sir.
- Blow, will you?
I'm busy.
- I-I'll get the colonel.
Look, guy.
This is all a joke.
Forget it and I'll get you some silk stockings.
- Sorry.
- Then how about some for your girl?
I went to school with this guy.
He's a captain.
Biggest practical joker in the world.
Do you read me?
Bottle of scotch?
How about a free operation?
Appendix?
Gallstones?
What's this about one of my surgeons being arrested?
- It's got to be Bardonaro again.
- Let me see the order.
"Willful misconduct"?
This is no practical joke.
This is a bona fide charge.
Enough of this fooling around.
Let's get down to some serious bribery.
How about $14 in unmarked bills?
- You're in serious trouble.
- Mm-hmm.
I'll get on the switchboard so you can call Major General Fox.
-  -  Klinger, take your shovel and hit the road.
- Just cleaning up the mess my Habibi made, sir.
- Bull.
- Oh, no, sir, camel.
- Out.
- As you command.
-  General Fox is on the line, sir.
General Fox?
Sherm Potter.
Right.
The M.P.s are here now.
What's this all about, Fred?
He what?
Girls?
Steaks?
Naked in the tub?
Oh, in the hall.
Can't be.
He was here.
What proof?
We'll be there.
Good-bye, General.
- What?
- Supposedly, 10 days ago in Seoul - the general was staying at the Grand Hotel.
- The Grand Central Hotel.
In the next room, you were throwing a wild party Ioud music with a bunch of bimbos.
- I thought we were friends.
Why wasn't I invited?
- You?
I wasn't even invited.
Then you went out on the balcony and barbecued steaks.
Teriyaki steaks on a hibachi.
Radar, were you listening on the other phone?
A little.
Well, the general's room filled with smoke, somebody yelled "Fire," and forced the general and his secretary to run into the hallway, naked.
- Naked?
- He, uh - was dictating to her.
- Mm.
Uh, in the bathtub.
Oh, sure.
And chickens have pyorrhea.
- Colonel, I was here 10 days ago.
- With me.
- We were having a company sock wash.
- Who was there?
- The dirty sock crowd.
- Colonel, I have orders to get the prisoner back by 2100 hours.
- Okay, okay.
- What do you mean okay?
You're gonna give in to a naked general when I got wounded in post-op?
A naked general still outranks a dressed wound.
- We'll cover for you, Beej.
- Let's go, Captain.
Uh, can I say something?
Uh, Captain Hunnicutt - Mm-hmm.
- I'll write you every day, sir.
Thank you, Radar.
Even if you're there for three years.
Thank you, Radar.
Don't worry, son.
We'll have this cleared up before you know it.
This whole thing is so stupid!
- That's exactly what Dreyfus said.
- Buzz off.
Now, look, son.
We'll gather up all the work logs.
We've got plenty of proof you were here.
Hawkeye and I'll be along as quick as we can.
B.J., I just heard.
Here.
Take these rosary beads.
- Thank you, Father.
I'm not Catholic.
- It can't hurt.
If it doesn't work, you can use them to strangle the guard.
We'll be about an hour behind you.
I'll come on a conjugal visit.
Knock off the didoes, Pierce.
We've got work to do.
I'll need you as a witness.
- Anything I can do?
- Pray.
Oh.
That's all I ever get to do.
- Colonel Potter, I must talk to you.
- Not now.
But you've got to let me go to Tokyo.
I must see Donald.
If I don't, Donald'll go crazy.
- Major, we've got a crisis!
- So has Donald!
Pierce, there might be some duty logs in post-op.
Aye, aye.
Margaret, I have a prescription for your problem.
- Oh.
- A tall, dark surgeon with the hands of Paganini - and the eyes of George Raft.
- I'm a married person.
- Get going, Pierce.
- Uh-huh.
Shave and put on your class "A" uniform.
Got it.
Bow tie and saddle shoes.
Colonel, I'm begging you.
I sympathize with you, Major.
Your Colonel Penobscott is away from the one he loves.
So tell him to take two laps around Tokyo preferably in a cold rain.
Habibi!
Ha!
- You sure you put everything in there?
- Yes, sir.
- Daily reports and duty logs.
- Good man.
I also put in some of your ear swabs, sir.
Good.
I wax up on these trips.
Where the hell is Hawkeye?
Captain Pierce!
Keep shouting like that, you'll break your glasses.
Sorry I'm late.
My zipper was mildewed.
Let's go.
Left at Chang Yung, right to Miju left at Chikchisa, then Yang Pong into Seoul.
Got all that?
- I'll follow the yellow brick road.
- Whatever.
- Hi.
- Shut up.
Get a call through to my husband Lieutenant Colonel Donald Penobscott, H.Q., Second Army Division, Tokyo.
Oh, sorry, ma'am, colonel's orders.
No personal calls until after 1700 hours.
How would you like to be up to your knees in floor?
Roger.
Sparky?
Sparky!
Oh, hi, Sparky.
It's Radar.
Listen, I gotta get through to Tokyo.
- Oh?
- What?
Uh, Sparky, this is top priority.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Um, I'm sorry, ma'am.
One of their generators burned out and they won't get another frequency till after midnight.
-  -  Oh, look what you've done!
My in-going and my outgoing.
- Now it's all in my out.
- Stuff it, you little shrimp!
- What l - No!
No, no, no.
- Ma'am, ma'am, this is all official stuff.
- I'm sick of it!
- I'm sick of all of you!
- Oh, no!
- I'm sick of the army!
- That's all in alphabetical order!
For Pete's sake!
"Oh, we need you, Houlihan.
We need you".
Always me!
Always me!
Why?
Why?
Why?
Well, you've been in the army a long time.
You're older.
Thanks for nothing!
You're very dependable and kind to the enlisted.
This man occupied a hotel room adjacent to mine.
He created an inordinate amount of smoke, interrupting my official dictation motivating me into a drafty hallway.
But, General, the duty logs, the daily reports.
Everything shows that Captain Hunnicutt was at the 4077.
Well, anybody could have signed those.
That's the oldest dodge in the army.
- I have Captain Pierce as a witness.
- He was with me in surgery.
I took some shell fragments out of a South Korean soldier.
Right.
That corporal who gave you the water buffalo horn for an ashtray.
What time were you two supposed to be in surgery?
Uh, right here.
Um, 0600 to 1117.
Plenty of time to get to Seoul by chopper.
He never left camp.
We had a company sock wash that night.
Colonel, did you witness this company sock wash?
Uh, it was for the younger crowd.
General, we have overwhelming evidence.
So do I. Photostat of the hotel register.
"B.J. Hunnicutt and a party of favorites"?
Sir, that's not my signature.
That signature could be forged.
The oldest dodge in the army.
All boils down to your word against ours.
What do these say to you?
Always trust your car to the man who wears a star.
- Clam up, Captain!
-  I have additional evidence.
Hunnicutt, you left in such a hurry, you left your hat.
- Sir, that's not my hat.
- Put it on.
General, I have never seen this hat as long as my head has lived.
There's one way to prove it.
Put it on.
It's his hat, all right.
Let's celebrate our victory over the brass.
Pull over under that tree, Hawkeye.
- Rest stop!
- B.J., break out one of those bottles.
You got it!
Practical jokes.
You can have them.
- That miserable Bardonaro.
- Ahh!
That'll clean your rifle barrel.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Easy, Hawkeye, easy.
Don't talk to the driver while he's drinking.
- Practical jokes are really cruel.
- Right.
- Right.
Vicious.
- Right.
- Sadistic.
- I couldn't agree more.
If I ever see that Bardonaro again, I'll break every sadistic bone in his body.
Ah, you'll see him again.
Remember when I took his coat?
- Huh?
- In the Swamp, with the cigar bit?
- I took his coat?
- Yeah?
I swiped his travel orders.
Colonel Potter?
Colonel Potter, I gotta speak to you.
Get rid of this dead soldier, soldier.
- Sir, but I still gotta speak to you.
- You walk funny.
- Poor toilet training.
- Colonel, this is important.
- Radar, baby.
Kiss me, you fool.
- Whew!
Holy mackerel.
Colonel, you gotta do something about Major Houlihan.
- An officer and a gentleman.
- You gotta let her see her husband or something.
You know what she did?
She kicked me and then she messed up my files from "M" to "Z" and everything.
- And then she got mad.
- Colonel Potter!
- Oh!
- Say no more.
You've convinced me.
Get packed.
You're going to Tokyo.
Give my love to Donald.
You know, I like a major with hot lips.
- And I'll tell you why.
- Why?
Exactly.
- Did I fall down?
- No.
I didn't think so.
Klinger.
Klinger.
Klinger.
Ah, Colonel, sahib.
You have returneth.
Good news, bugle beak.
I brought a discharge from Seoul.
Oh, be still my throbbing heart.
It's for the camel.
He can pack his humps and leave anytime.
It's always the other guy.
Oh, Leo!
Oh, you!
- You creep!
- Hey, look, fellas.
I'm really sorry about the General Fox thing.
Okay?
Sorry don't feed the bulldog.
- No, seriously.
I'm very sorry.
- Uh-huh.
I didn't know General Fox was right next door.
- B.J.?
- Yeah.
- Can I have my travel orders back?
- Tr-Travel orders?
What travel orders?
I haven't seen any travel or - Have you seen any travel orders?
- I saw my first robin.
Come on, Beej.
I haven't seen my folks for two years.
- Oh, poor guy.
- Oh, really?
- Come on.
Come on.
- All right.
All right.
- No, no, no, no.
Don't do it.
- It's okay.
- On one condition.
- Yo.
We shake hands and promise no more practical jokes.
Okay, okay, deal.
Gimme the papers.
- Don't forget the handshake.
- Right.
Right.
- Ah!
- Ah!
- Oh, you  - All right.
All right.
- Here.
- Like I said, I'll call Peg.
Okay.
Good.
Leo, you  - How do we get to Kimpo Air Base?
- It's, um No, I don't have any wheels.
Wheels!
Take our jeep.
It's parked in front of the hospital.
- It's all gassed up.
- It's all gassed up.
- I don't know how to thank you guys.
- I do.
Blow.
Yo.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, oh, Hawkeye, the tent is spinning around.
- Which way?
- Clockwise.
Mine's going counterclockwise.
Maybe together we're sober.
- Hi.
Hey, B.J. - Huh?
- While you was away, this mail come for you.
- Okay.
Thank you, Radar.
- Bardonaro!
- Bardonaro, you creep!
Bardonaro!
You see Look what he did.
Look what I got.
A bill from that hotel in Seoul, in my name for damages 580 bucks.
We What the hell are we laughing at?
Well, he'll be walking back here in about an hour.
He'll be walking back?
The only thing gassed up in that jeep was us.
- To my dear wife.
- To my darling wife.
To Goldie, the waitress at Barney's Bar and Grill.
-  - Come in.
- Hi.
- Well, look who's back.
-  How was Tokyo?
- Oh - Never mind Tokyo.
How's Donald?
- He's in wonderful shape.
- He's so relaxed now.
- Good.
Is that a jug?
Thank you for giving me leave.
Thank you.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I have some things to rinse out.
-  Would you do my underwear?
-  And my socks?
Another time, Captains.
- Huh.
- Didn't even get a rise out of her.
She's no fun when Donald's relaxed.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Attention all personnel.
You're not gonna believe this but there's a new shipment of wounded in the compound.
Please report for triage.
I told you you wouldn't believe it.
I've got multiple compound fractures and severe abdominal trauma.
- This guy better go first.
- I got a sucking chest in the balcony, Doctor.
This guy better go before first.
Whole blood and prep him, stat.
- Get that down tight, will ya?
- Yes.
Sidney, what are you doing here?
I don't know.
I thought I was getting on the crosstown bus.
Do you give transfers here?
How did you get this red stuff all over your head?
Well, you might find it hard to believe, but I was doing therapy in a foxhole with that boy.
- We started to get overrun by some of those Chinese fellows.
- Oh, group therapy.
Then to discourage the Chinese, our artillery started lobbing shells into the area.
That discouraged all of us.
- How's my tuchus?
- Fine.
Just a little diaper rash.
Get the clothes off these Chinese patients add 'em to the Chinese uniforms we got from our last session and burn 'em.
- They're infested.
- Yes, sir.
Sidney, what happened?
Well, it's a long story but it's the last house call I'll ever make.
When I first saw this boy, he had to be carried into my office.
He wasn't wounded.
He'd seen three of his buddies killed in 24 hours.
Hysterical paralysis.
How'd you get him back to the front?
We used to send these cases home.
- The problems just stuck with them all their lives.
- Hmm.
But if the trauma is recent enough and the defenses haven't built up to the point where they'll resist treatment - it'll yield to talking.
- Hmm.
But you gotta get them right back to their unit.
So how come you wound up in the foxhole?
Doing a follow-up.
You can't just send them out and forget 'em.
Major Winchester, I'm terribly sorry.
Would you mind stepping outside and scrubbing up?
I kind of doubt that'll be necessary, Major.
I just spent seven and a half minutes scrubbing.
- Yes, but that was before you touched your nose.
- I beg your pardon.
Your nose.
You touched your nose.
You're no longer sterile.
If you operate now, you'll contaminate the field.
Of course.
That is precisely what I would do, if in fact I had touched my nose, which I didn't.
Major, I saw you touch your nose!
Major, do you think my face is insensate?
Don't you think if I had touched my nose, I would have felt it?
I just felt something over my lip.
Maybe you touched my nose.
You touch his nose, you'll have to marry him.
Colonel Potter, I clearly saw Major Winchester touch his nose.
You naughty boy.
Colonel, I refuse to spend another seven and a half minutes scrubbing up because of this woman's paranoid hallucinations!
She's a pretty good observer, Winchester.
I did not touch my no I did not touch my nose.
You did touch your nose!
I saw you touch your nose!
It's the battle of the noses, ladies and gentlemen.
Who do you think is ahead?
- Well, Winchester was ahead for a while, but he blew it.
- Say, that's disgusting.
How am I expected to operate in here if I must continually leave to wash my hands?
-  Don't touch your nose!
-  Idiots.
Careful you don't scald yourself with that coffee, Major.
You have definite problems with depth perception.
Oh, I know what I saw, Major.
A nose is a nose is a nose.
Where are you two kids gonna be eating?
I'd like to sit on the other side of Korea.
- Why don't you stuff it?
- What are you getting mad at me for?
- I didn't touch my nose.
- But you did.
- No, I did not.
- You did.
- You most certainly did!
- I did not touch my nose!
Excuse me, sir.
Mommy's got dinner ready, but I can't find my daddy.
He's this big hairy man in an undershirt.
Fascinating case, eh, Sidney?
What do you make of it?
Well, it's either a serious regression to childhood or possibly some kind of borderline schizophrenia.
Regression.
That one.
All of a sudden I feel real small, you know?
Maybe I should sit down and tell you about it.
- I'm so glad we're not late for the dinner show.
- Toast of Broadway strikes again.
- I got it.
Smell this.
- Oh, come on.
Don't start with me.
- I know what it smells like.
- I mean it.
I can't eat if you do that.
Just take a sniff.
If you took a raw egg and buried it in a shoe - under a chicken coop - I told you not to do that!
How am I gonna eat this stuff?
- Am I right?
But a brown egg.
A brown egg, right?
- Will you shut up?
Who gave you permission to steal my personal private property?
I'll tell my daddy you did that.
He's got big long hairy arms.
- So's your old man.
- Radar, I need it.
It proves I'm crazy.
- Major Freedman said so.
- It proves you're crazy 'cause you carry a teddy bear, huh?
- Will you stop?
I'm halfway home.
- How'd you like to get knocked all the way home?
- Smell this.
- Will you, for crying out loud, stop making me smell your food?
- I can't eat as it is!
- You know, you're completely deficient in imagination.
- You're completely deficient.
- Let's have it quiet in here.
- Look what you're doin'!
You're hurting him!
- I haven't done a thing!
Let's calm down.
- Just give it a little try.
Come on.
- No!
- If anyone touched my nose, you did!
- Huh!
I wouldn't touch your nose with a ten-foot pole!
- Hello.
Testing.
-  One, two, three.
Sidney, wait up.
I'm kind of glad you're here.
These people are fallin' apart.
- How long they been acting like that?
- Couple of weeks.
No rest.
Nothin' but work.
This unit is running as smoothly as a pig on stilts.
It was a little quieter in that foxhole this morning.
Sidney, what would you say to seeing a few of the folk - on an informal basis while you're here?
- Sure.
Why not?
Use the V.I.P. Tent.
I'll discreetly direct a few of the loonier ones your way.
Just make sure they come in one at a time.
Listen, I'm no head doctor, but I think they need a little diversion.
You know, something to break the routine.
Some square dancing or some Sure!
Square dancing.
That's the ticket!
- They're kind of exhausted - Look, I'm their commanding officer.
If I say dance, they hoof.
Did you hear what I said?
Maybe you better save an hour for me.
Watch out, Major.
We're gonna light a fire here.
So stand back.
Will you hold on?
I got another load to put on there.
So put it on.
What do I care?
I wanna go to dinner.
- I haven't eaten since reveille.
- What's the fire for?
We're burning the Chinese uniforms.
They're infested.
If we had to burn every louse in this camp, we'd have to burn this camp.
Look, I just wanna do my job and go and eat.
- Am I stoppin' you?
- You keep passin' remarks back and forth.
Trouble with you is you're too sensitive!
-  -  Come in.
I hope I'm not disturbing you, Major.
Not at all.
Nice to see you, Major.
Well, I'm here primarily as a favor to Colonel Potter.
Sure.
What's up?
I have a problem by the name of Charles Emerson Winchester.
Winchester is your problem?
- He's insane.
- Really?
He has no grasp of reality.
For instance, uh, just to give you an example It's insignificant really.
He touched his nose in surgery and won't admit it!
Is that crazy, or is that crazy?
Classic.
How often does he go for his nose?
The point is he denies it!
He's completely irrational!
How do I know what he'll try to touch next?
Ah-hah.
What's that supposed to mean?
"Ah-hah".
I know an "Ah-hah" when I hear one.
- You think I'm infatuated with him, don't you?
- Is that what I think?
Well, let me set your mind at ease, Major.
The only reason he goes for his nose is because it's the only living thing around here that would have him!
I don't know.
He seems like a decent person.
Intelligent, a certain amount of wit.
And money.
Let's not forget his money which he's constantly flaunting in front of us with his laundered hankies and his monogrammed caviar.
- I suppose you think I find money attractive.
- I have no idea.
Money is far down on my list, Major.
Money comes second, maybe even third.
Second.
Anyway, the man is totally self-absorbed!
What do you think of him?
Well, he seems basically normal.
- Uh-huh.
In other words you think he's crazy about me.
- I do?
Well, I just wouldn't be too sure about that if I were you.
-  - Come in.
Uh, if you have any more pain, Major, just take some aspirin.
Oh, thank you, Margaret.
I'll go now.
I'm sure you have some sort of mental problem to discuss.
Now I ask you.
Did I say anything to provoke that?
I tell you, Major, that woman is verging on a very serious breakdown.
If I had any confidence at all in psychiatry  I would recommend, uh, treatment.
Thank you.
Was there anything else you wanted to talk about?
Hardly.
I do not intend to be part of Colonel Potter's psychiatric cattle drive.
I just dropped by to say that I won't be dropping by.
Would dropping by make you uncomfortable?
No.
Don't waste your clinical come-on with me, Doctor.
I had my fill of psychiatrists at the age of nine.
And no, I don't care to talk about it.
And no, I don't care to talk about it.
Look, the point is she is the one who is obsessed.
She watches my every movement.
My body seems to be of intense interest to her.
Which I suppose you find, uh, very revealing, right?
Hmm.
In other words, the woman's crazy about me.
Huh?
Please, don't make me laugh.
I don't know whatever got into me.
Okay, let's light it.
Come on.
Come on.
What are you waitin' for?
You know, if we toss this crate on over there it could really be a nice little fire.
Yeah.
Right.
Nice.
Tom, you're gonna be fine.
You'll need a little more surgery down in Seoul, and some therapy, but you're gonna walk.
Well, I don't know if you guys take tips but my dad is the king of the hardware business in Cleveland.
You need a sink or anything, I can get you a dozen.
- King of the hardware business.
Maybe he can get us a throne.
- You name it.
- Why don't you get a little rest?
- We'll check you later.
Okay.
If I'm not here, I've just gone dancing.
- Sidney.
- How's the kid?
- Oh, you gotta see him.
- He's doing great.
I can't believe he was a basket case a week ago.
He's cheerful.
He's joking.
I don't know how you did it.
The big thing is getting them back to the front as fast as possible.
It really works.
Come on in.
You're in for a real treat.
How ya feelin', Tom?
How am I feelin'?
You crud!
I'll tell you how I'm feelin'.
I feel like I had my damn legs blown off!
How do you think I'm feelin'?
I'd be back home walkin' around on two good legs if you hadn't sent me back to that ridge.
Tom, you were able to walk back to the ridge because of the work we did together.
Why don't we talk about it for a few minutes?
Don't come near me, you butcher!
Now, I'm telling you.
You get him outta here, or I am gonna wreck this place.
If you change your mind, I'll be in my tent.
Well, you seem to be getting your strength back.
Anything we can get you A baseball bat?
A crowbar?
Sorry I raised my voice back there, Doc.
I want you guys to know that I'm grateful for what you did for me.
Good night.
Klinger.
My, how you've grown.
Seems like just this morning you were a little girl in Mary Janes.
Can I talk to you, Major.
I hear you got your shingle out.
I realize I've only told you about a hundred and twelve times but I can't help you with the Section Eight routine.
Oh, I don't wanna talk about getting out.
I wanna talk about being crazy.
Well, this is a novel approach.
Go on.
No, I mean it.
I'm afraid I'm going crazy.
- You want me to lie down?
- What's the problem?
Well, I look at myself in the mirror lately, and I see this guy in earrings, pillbox hat, veil maybe a little choker of pearls.
And I ask myself "Would a sane man dress like this"?
I'm tryin' to convince them, and I'm convincing myself.
- You're actually worried?
- Major, I think I'm really goin' nuts.
Gina Lollobrigida used to make me drool and last week I looked at a picture of this beautiful, voluptuous woman and all I could think of was "How could she wear a peasant blouse with a tweed skirt"?
Now is that "el flippo" or what?
Look, you're in the crazy business.
Fashion consciousness is just a tool of the trade.
Doc, I go to sleep wondering if my pleats will hold out for another day.
My palms got sweaty last week when I read that cocktail-length hems are going longer in the back, and I just don't have the material.
Now that's sane, right?
Klinger, let me ask you something.
Why do you want to get out of here?
Why?
Well, there's, there's lots of reasons.
I guess death tops the list.
I don't want to die.
And I don't want to look at other people while they do it.
And I don't want to be told where to stand while it happens to me.
And I don't want to be told how to do it to somebody else.
And I ain't gonna.
Period.
That's it.
I'm gettin' out.
You don't like death.
Overall, I'd rather lay in a hammock with a couple of girls than be dead.
Yes.
Listen, Klinger.
You're not crazy.
I'm not?
Really?
You're a tribute to man's endurance.
A monument to hope in size 12 pumps.
I hope you do get out someday.
There would be a battalion of men in hoopskirts right behind you.
- Thank you, Doc.
- Anytime.
- Anything else I can help with?
- No, I gotta get goin'.
I got some nylons soaking.
May I ask what's going on here?
Well, sir, we were burnin' the Chinese uniforms, sir, because they're infested.
Are you telling me some Chinese soldier came in here wearing an American ladder?
Oh, uh, l-I guess that must've just slipped up there by mistake, sir.
Well, you better slip it back off, Zale or your service record is liable to get one giant hotfoot.
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
You see how loony they're getting?
You know, this may be just what they need.
Major, when people are suffering from overwork do you usually prescribe arson?
Because if you do, I'm gonna take another look under that bandage.
Look, Colonel, they don't want to burn the whole camp, just carefully selected bits of it.
Actually it's a pretty controlled response to this place.
They might actually have found themselves that pressure valve you're looking for.
All right, let me have your attention.
I am reversing my previous order.
You are hereby directed to assemble one regulation, bon-type fire.
-  - Psst.
Psst.
Psst.
- Psst.
- Did you want to see me, or have you sprung a leak?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't want to go into your tent 'cause I was afraid somebody might think I was crazy.
What can I do for you?
- I think I'm goin' crazy.
- Why is that?
- Well, it's about my teddy bear.
- He's been acting strangely?
- Huh?
- What about him?
Well, I never say anything to the guys when they kid me about sleepin' with it.
Except now and then I think about it in the back of my head.
And when you told Klinger that it proved he was crazy 'cause he carried a teddy bear I started thinkin' about it in the front of my head.
Radar, you can't prove anything about anybody by what he carries.
MacArthur carries a swagger stick.
That doesn't prove he's a general.
Yeah, but me and my teddy bear are very close.
I mean sometimes I talk to it.
Does it ever talk back?
- No.
- So?
Do you know how many people write letters to Romeo and Juliet and think I Love Lucy is real?
And those people are living nice safe lives with towels and sheets.
They're not up to their ankles in mud, blood and death the way you are.
But what happens when I go back home?
My guess is you probably won't need him anymore.
I won't need him anymore?
That's okay though, 'cause I have a feeling I will.
Look, officially we don't care what goes on inside your head.
We're just interested in the same part of you that your tailor is.
We're sending you to a guy in Seoul who's gonna turn you back into a 38 long.
If I know Sidney Freedman, all you have to do is say the word and he'll get in this ambulance and drive all the way down to Seoul with you.
- I'm telling you as your doctor.
You oughta think about it.
- Well Why don't we get Sidney and you can talk to him?
Yeah, see how you feel about him?
All right.
All right, yeah.
I'll talk to him for a minute.
Sidney?
Sidney?
It's Tom.
I think I have another house call for you.
Let's go.
He may let you ride with him back to Seoul.
You interested?
Are you kidding?
- Hi, Tom.
- Hello, Doc.
Dr. Pierce and Dr. Hunnicutt thought I should talk to you before I go down to Seoul, and I thought that would be a pretty good idea too.
- Sure, Tom.
- I mean, I may never get to see you again.
Sure.
Doc, I know I've been rough on you.
And I know you didn't mean to do me any harm although I have never been harmed so much in my life.
And I am never gonna forgive you as long as I live.
- Tom, come on, will ya?
- I'm sorry, Doc.
I don't care if they fix me up better than brand-new down there.
I'll never forget what it felt like being back in that foxhole when you knew what I'd been through.
I'll never forget how it feels to get my legs shot up and I'm never gonna forget how much I hate you.
Good-bye, Doctor.
All right.
Put him inside.
Sorry, Sidney.
Well, he may do all right.
-  - It's very possible that getting his anger out on me is the best thing for him.
On the other hand, I'll never know.
Come in.
Oh, hi, Father.
I didn't expect to be seeing you in here.
Yes, well, uh - Please.
- Oh, thank you.
Well, l-I've come about a friend.
I see.
What's his problem?
Well, things aren't going so well for him and he's feeling a little low.
- Who is your friend, Father?
- You.
I wonder if a good antidote might be to think about all the successes you've had.
I would think you've had a few, no?
Sure.
I've sent dozens of kids back to the front and they're fine now.
It hurts to think you might lose even one, though, doesn't it?
See, when Pierce or Hunnicutt lose one he's out of his misery.
But when I lose one, I've lost a mind.
When I lose one, I've lost a soul.
Well, I guess it's all in how you look at it.
Sounds like they're having a good time.
Well, they're following your prescription.
You've certainly done an admirable job here.
Why don't you come on out and take a little of your own medicine?
You know, this wasn't my idea.
It was theirs.
They have an uncanny knack for health here not to mention antic lunacy.
Ho-Ho-Hold it!
Wait a minute!
Here goes.
- The army cookbook!
Yea!
-  ##    Yeah, Colonel Potter!
One, two, three!
A cot.
How can you do that?
It's just an object.
It has no intrinsic value.
It's just a thing.
Besides, it's yours.
#Keep the home fires burning #  #While your hearts are yearning # #Though your lads are far away # #They dream of home # #There's a silver lining # #Through the dark cloud shining # #Turn the dark cloud inside out # #Till the boys come home ## Come on, Radar.
We gotta start a new day.
I can't find it, sir.
Oh, wait a minute.
Here it is.
##  You know, it sounds a little better.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
##  Dear Mother and Dad I have only been here a short while, but it seems forever.
MASH 4077 is truly a nightmare.
It is either too cold or it is unbearably hot.
I needn't tell you again I won't be happy until I am out of here.
I have even contemplated shooting myself in the foot.
But you know how much I enjoy the annual Debs' Cotillion.
Mail!
Hunnicutt.
Hunnicutt.
Hunnicutt.
Pierce.
And two for our high-class society major, Winchester.
Klinger, you are really full of it.
- We are what we eat, sir.
-  Almost forgot.
Captain Pierce's nudist magazine.
Hmm.
A nudist wedding.
- The bride is wearing white sneakers.
- My Lord!
- Sir?
- My nephew Felix is being discharged from the service because of fainting spells.
- Really, sir?
- Mm-hmm, and very strange.
Everything seems to go a sort of dark gray.
- Yes?
Yes?
- And then he experiences dizziness.
- Go on.
- And then he swoons and, uh, passes out.
Ohh!
Klinger, come off it.
When a person faints, he falls forward.
False alarm.
Mail!
Somebody sent me a person.
Come on, Klinger.
Up, up.
- Where am I?
- Let's go.
Up.
Oh!
Captain Pierce.
You got here just in time.
- The craziest thing happened.
- Oh, yeah?
Suddenly, everything went a dark gray.
Then I experienced dizziness.
Then I fainted, falling forward.
What is that?
- I think you got a whiff of your own breath.
- Oh, sorry.
My mother sent me a garlic pie.
Want dibs?
- I had an apple on the train.
-  Attention, all personnel.
Colonel Potter speaking.
Klinger, where the hell's the mail?
- I love that man.
-  Uh-oh.
- Peg got poison oak.
- Where?
- In the woods.
- That can be painful.
Frazier Continental down seven points.
Who are they playing?
A major financial loss is hardly a laughing matter.
- I apologize.
- Do you expect me to believe that?
- I wouldn't if I were you.
- This is incredible!
- What, what?
- I'm going to heaven.
- That is incredible.
- Beej.
- You remember Nurse Gilmore?
- Yeah, she was engaged to the navy dentist.
She just became disengaged.
All of a sudden the red light has turned green and she's inviting me to spend the weekend with her in Seoul.
Sounds like she's making a three-day pass at you.
I can't believe it.
To think that someone with such grace, wit, sensibility, intelligence and charm would be sending for little old me.
- Who'd have thought it?
- Certainly not I. This woman has the patent on wonderful.
Smell that.
Is she wonderful?
- Yeah, wonderful.
- Oh!
That's wonderful.
Pity you have to decline the invitation, Pierce.
You are Officer of the Day all weekend.
- Beej, take O.D. For me, will ya?
- I can't.
I'm in O.R. -  - Charles, come on, as a friend.
- Not even as an enemy.
- Charles!
Sorry.
O.D.?
O.D. Is a duty.
I've already done mine.
Weekend's your turn.
Look, I'll take all your duty for the next three days if you'll just work this weekend.
I hate working weekends.
What difference does it make?
Every day is a holiday in Korea.
- It's just the thought.
- I'll let you use my aftershave.
- Kerosene makes me break out.
- Money?
You can't buy me.
How much?
How much did you lose on the Frazier Continental thing?
- Four thousand dollars.
- Deal.
Come on!
How much have you really got?
- Twelve dollars and 80 cents.
- Ha!
- Boutonniere money.
- He'll owe you the rest.
- Sorry.
- Charles, you don't understand!
This woman This She Roses have fistfights to see who could smell like her.
Her wit is so sharp, you could shave with it.
When they heard the sound of her laughter, six nightingales got out of the business.
- This She's got - All right, all right, all right.
I'm giving in merely because I can use a three-day vacation from you.
Now, please don't get the idea that I'm doing it because I am generous or worse, amiable.
Trust me.
No one will ever think of you as anything but completely rotten.
- Thank you.
-  - Oh, listen, I need some clean shirts.
- The laundry lady broke her rock.
Why don't these people get a service contract?
- I need shirts, shorts, socks and a jeep.
- What size jeep?
- Thirty-four.
Loose in the seat.
- You could use a haircut.
Let's see Klinger about the jeep.
- How's my nostril hair?
- I'd look, but I'm afraid of the dark.
Sorry.
A brief interruption.
Pierce and Hunnicutt were regaling each other with their version of wit dirty laundry and nose hair.
Constant exposure to these two cretins annoys me and aggravates my-my misery more than I can tell you but, always hopeful I am endearing myself to the C. O the man responsible for my presence in this cesspool.
He's a tough, bandy-legged little mustang, but guess what?
He paints.
He's somewhat of a primitive.
He's no Churchill, surely, but I have agreed to pose for him.
Raise your chin a little, Winchester.
Boy, you've got a tough ear.
It's all lobe.
- Dad's.
- Fat-eared cuss, eh?
May I speak, sir?
Long as you don't move that ear.
Sir, I have been here interminably.
- Time flies when you've got good duty.
- Sir, you don't understand.
- I feel that my talents are such that - I cleaned your brushes, sir.
- Good man.
- I couldn't find any turpentine, so I used yesterday's soup.
- Cleanest they've been in years.
- Gee, that's wonderful, sir.
- Thank you.
- Who is that?
Guess.
I better go polish your horse.
As I was saying, sir - I feel I could be more useful in Tokyo or even the States.
- Not to me, Commissioner.
This meatball surgery of yours is causing my skills to deteriorate.
- They're wasting away!
- Don't change the color of your face!
I'm out of umber!
- And I'm out of patience!
This place is driving me mad!
- Cool off, Winchester!
- How can I cool off in this godforsaken pesthole?
- You're here, so get used to it.
You haven't lifted a finger to get me transferred.
- That's right, and I don't intend to.
- I think you ought to consider Not again, Major!
I've had enough of your beefing!
I need you here, and you'll stay here like the rest of us.
Here.
Your face is finished.
Father, you must know someone influential.
I know what about that former brigadier general who's now a doorman at The Plaza?
I understand he's very close to Arthur Godfrey.
Well, keep trying.
Please.
Interesting thing about military units quite often, one discovers that the actual day-to-day routine is dependent upon one small enlisted man.
Here at 4077 it's a myopic farm boy, Corporal Radar O'Reilly.
Okay, there's a razor in here and some shaving cream and a toothbrush.
Ooh, by the way, I, uh, got you two T-shirts from the officers' supply.
- Gee, that's really - Shh, shh, shh.
If anybody found out, I wouldn't be allowed to see the movie for a month.
- Oh.
Shh.
- Saturday's Bogart.
Waiter, if me and the boys wanted to eat mucilage - we would've ordered mucilage.
-  Hey, listen, remember what Captain Hunnicutt said about your pills.
The purple ones are for pain.
That's "P" for pain, "P" for purple.
The white ones are for sleep.
"W" for white, "W" for sleep.
"W" for Well, you can work that out.
- Hey, all that's on the bottles.
- Oh, yeah.
That's a good idea.
Okay, your bus leaves in an hour.
Get to the departure lounge early.
That's the dead tree by the latrine.
Listen, Corporal, my buddy in that bed leaves tomorrow.
Can I stay one more day and go with him?
We've been together since basic.
- Oh, sure.
I could work that out.
- Certainly not.
You go when you're scheduled, soldier.
- Thanks for nothin'.
- Don't worry about him.
I can fix it.
Captain?
He's the chief surgeon.
What is it, Radar?
I'm in a hurry.
I gotta get my body to Seoul.
Yes, sir.
McCloud wants to wait till tomorrow and go home with his buddy but Major Winchester says he's gotta go today.
Winchester, Winchester.
Tall chap?
Looks like a cat who swallowed a sour mouse?
Don't worry about it.
Go tomorrow.
What does the war care?
Hey, thank you, sir.
Say, you carry a lot of weight around here.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, listen while you're waiting, have you seen our cockroach collection?
Uh, no.
Takes an hour, but it's well worth the time.
The humidity here is disastrous.
Please send me some deodorant.
I don't care about the others I don't want to offend myself.
To continue about Corporal O'Reilly I upset him the other day, which I can ill-afford to do.
His telephone is my sole contact with the outside world.
I must attempt to mollify him and try to contact Tokyo.
Corporal, I was rather harsh with you in post-op.
Remember?
Well, I brought you this case of grape Nehi as an apology.
Oh, grape Nehi.
At Rosie's it costs me a buck a bottle.
Price is no object when you're doing something for a friend.
-  Colonel Potter says no long distance - I wanna make a call - phone calls.
- To Colonel Baldwin in Seoul.
- How did you know I was gonna say that?
- That's why they call me "Radar".
- This is an emergency.
-  Even in an emergency.
Can you tell me what I'm about to say now?
Yes, sir, but I promised Father Mulcahy I wouldn't use those words.
-  -  Come on, Beej.
You gotta have a pair of pajamas.
Look around.
You had a pair when you got here.
I had a lot of things when I got here faith, hope, sanity, a liver.
Ahh!
Charming.
- I wouldn't wear that.
- You're right.
It's too hot for fur.
- Wait, wait, wait!
- What, what, what?
Don't throw it toward the kitchen.
You know how they are.
-  - Oh, good.
One down, two to go.
- Charlie, you got pajamas.
Just lend me one pair.
- No.
- Just the tops.
- No.
- The bottoms.
You can keep the string.
- Forget it.
All right, but you're no longer my best friend.
What about you?
No pajamas, Hawk.
You'll have to rely on your personality.
- Gotcha a jeep.
- Great!
- Klinger, can you loan him some pajamas?
- No.
But I got a lovely, low-cut peignoir chickadee red with Oriental peacocks embroidered over each breast.
- Sounds pretty risque.
- Should be for eight books of green stamps.
Get outta here!
Socks, shorts, shirts Aftershave.
- Ah, be my guest.
Babalu Number Five.
- Ah.
One for the master.
One for the desk clerk.
And one for the little girl who waits in the room.
- Laundry.
- Oh, good.
You got your rock fixed.
- Five bucks.
- See him.
- Five bucks.
- He gets the cleaning, and I get cleaned.
Shirts, socks, shorts Ahh!
Pajamas!
- Those are mine, Pierce.
- Just for two nights.
No.
My mother gave me these for my birthday.
- It's time they went to a party.
- Pierce, come on With my compliments.
Attention, all personnel.
Incoming wounded.
- No, no, no, no!
I'm going to Seoul.
- Let's go, lover.
No, you don't understand.
Gilmore, roses, nightingales, room service.
No, no, no.
O.R. Blood, sutures, scalpels.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Dad, you have got to get me out of here.
Talk to Senator Griswold.
After all, you paid good money for him.
I am doing my best to adjust to these bizarre people.
There is a transvestite corporal with dreadful taste in clothes and a head nurse who is part seductress and part Attila the Hun.
You did beautifully, Doctor, removing shrapnel from that liver.
Thank you.
I was graded quite highly in liver.
- I didn't know you had a sense of humor.
- I haven't.
I suppose you've performed that operation a hundred times.
Hardly.
There's very little shrapnel flying around Boston.
You do have a sense of humor.
Humor is the opiate of the incompetent.
Terrific words just roll right out of your mouth.
It must be wonderful.
No, my dear.
Brilliance can be very lonely.
Things are getting a dark gray.
The room is swimming.
- I'm going!
I'm going!
Save the towels!
- Oh, Klinger.
Pay no attention.
It's a new discharge ploy.
Big mistake.
Always know your audience.
I hate a guy who stays through two shows.
- Oh!
Oh!
- Something wrong?
My eye.
There's something in I think there's something in my eye.
- Would you mind?
- No.
I'll get closer.
I see no foreign matter.
You have such small pores.
A Winchester never perspires.
- There's absolutely nothing in your eye.
- I can feel it.
I'll check again.
Oh, terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
Oh, dear.
Father, there's no need for "Oh, dear".
I'm a married woman.
Oh, yes, of course.
I forgot.
Well, pax vobiscum.
I'm not sure he believes there was no hanky panky.
- Well, there wasn't.
- Then why are you sweating?
I can see her now, checking her watch for the 60th time this minute.
Watch what you're doing.
You'll turn yourself into a living statue.
- I gotta get to Seoul.
- As long as you're plastering yourself you might as well do the walls too.
- Colonel, I gotta talk to you.
- Hurry up, before that stuff on your mouth hardens.
What do I have to do to get out of here?
I operated on 30 people.
I bandaged everybody in post-op three times.
I repaired the anesthesia machine.
I mixed enough plaster of Paris to plaster Paris.
And speaking of Paris, if I don't amours toujours in Seoul ce soir you're gonna have an unknown soldier on your hands.
- Okay, I'll stand in for you.
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
I'd give you a hug, but in my condition I might not be able to stop.
B.J., Corporal Graham's bleeding and going into shock.
I'll have to open him up again.
Go!
- Sorry, son.
- Who's complaining?
Look at me.
I'm one foot closer to Seoul.
Our spiritual guide through this Oriental purgatory is a cock-eyed optimist who sounds like Dennis Day.
- Ah!
Good news, Major.
- Hello.
- Hot water thawed?
- Better.
One of your patients will recover.
Don't pull your cross on me, Lieutenant.
Oh!
Forgive me.
What I mean is Doren, that highly critical patient was saved by your operation.
- Oh.
- My prayers were answered.
- Thank God.
- Thank me, Father.
I'd prefer to think that my surgical skills are responsible.
Aha!
That's what I prayed for.
One of my tent mates is a relatively inoffensive chap named B.J. Hunnicutt.
Excellent surgeon, in spite of the fact that he was born, raised and studied in California.
Notwithstanding, he's certainly no adult delinquent like Pierce.
I was quite touched by Hunnicutt's concern for my mysterious loss of weight a month ago.
- Hunnicutt.
- Winchester.
- Where's your friend Pierce?
- Today's Thursday.
- So?
- Nurses hang their underwear on the line.
He takes a sandwich and makes a day of it.
Nudist magazines, underwear watching.
- Why this constant preoccupation with sex?
- Lack of occupation with sex.
Good Lord.
What's the matter?
Well, l I never noticed it before.
I seem to have dropped some weight.
You certainly have.
Must not be eating enough.
- Well, I can't stand the food.
-  Tell you what you gotta do.
When you've been here as long as I have, you learn to use internal propaganda.
You brain has to teach your taste buds to lie to your stomach.
You've, uh, made that adjustment?
- Not necessary for me.
My wife's a lousy cook.
- Oh, come now.
Oh, really?
You don't believe me?
Try some of this cake.
But be careful.
- See?
- Mmm.
No, now, wait.
This isn't bad.
- Really?
- In fact, it's delicious.
- Very good.
You catch on fast.
Take some more.
- Well, one piece perhaps.
- No, no, no.
Take the whole thing.
- Oh, I couldn't.
- Please.
- Thank you.
My.
This food is disappointing.
Forgive the cook, Father, for he knows not what he does.
That's a great deal of food, Major.
The man's been losing weight, Father, wasting away.
- Well, he looks the same to me.
- Looks the same, you say?
This frail, emaciated nebbish is not the same robust surgeon who recently swelled our ranks.
Put a little pepper in your powdered eggs.
It kills the warehouse flavor.
Well, I still can't see any difference.
Father, observe the hollowed cheeks, sunken eyes.
Soon, you can play xylophone on these ribs.
Ooh!
That burns.
- I'll take that sweet roll, Hunnicutt.
- Be my guest, Charles.
- We'll have those pants filled out in no time.
- Here, take this.
- Potatoes?
- Rumor has it.
- Drink your milk, Charles.
- Thank you, Hunnicutt.
- Don't talk with your mouth full.
Eat, eat.
-  All clear.
Now, whose are these?
- Levine's.
- Beanpole Levine?
- The same.
- I'm glad you're not my enemy.
Never assume.
Check the door.
Clap hands.
Here comes Charlie.
-  - Shh, shh, shh!
- You're a vicious fiend.
- Worse than you?
- By far.
- Nicest thing you ever said to me.
Thank you.
- Oh, my pleasure.
- My pleasure.
- Anytime.
- Do I actually hear the sound of manners?
- This is a recording.
- Of course.
- Hey, does this look like fungus?
- Hmm?
You're going to meet a curly headed woman with a large mole and a DeSoto sedan.
The Fulcrum school of comedy.
Raise your arms and lower the humor.
- You all right, Charles?
- Everything okay?
Yes.
I can't seem to button my trousers.
- You've forgotten how?
- No.
Well, I've been eating like a horse for the past month.
I seem to have put about three inches around the middle.
Oh.
Well, it's time it's time for a diet.
- Maybe some exercise.
- Yes, and now.
- Now.
- Mm-hmm.
So, uh, what's next with him?
Starting tomorrow, he gets taller.
What a time to get hit with another load of wounded.
I should've been in Seoul in Gilmore's arms last night.
- She'll keep.
- If room service doesn't run out of ice.
More silk.
More 3.0 silk.
Come on, hurry!
Come on.
Slow down, hot pants.
This'll be your last patient, I promise.
Anybody need any help?
Father, would you run down to the Regency Hotel in Seoul and keep a young lady company until I get there?
- You I can trust.
-  I'm afraid she'll have to settle for the Gideon Bible.
Now, you see here, what I've done here is I've done the anastomosis in two layers chromic for the mucosa and silk for the serosa.
This way, see, it won't have to be redone later.
Come on, Charles.
You've taken twice as long with that guy as necessary.
Patch 'em up and save their lives.
Let Tokyo General press the lapels.
If it wasn't for you, I could've been out of here an hour ago.
I'm merely sharing my expertise with the less learned.
Oh, put it in a sack.
Klinger!
Somewhere through a misty haze I hear my name called.
- Any more patients out there?
- Just one.
- Bring him in.
- He's here.
Up!
Up!
One more phony faint, and you're on the front lines.
- Now get this patient into post-op.
- Sir, you're turning mean.
After 12 hours of surgery, what do you expect, Albert Schweitzer?
Out!
Out!
- Need any help, Pierce?
- Almost finished.
Ha!
A scar is born.
And with that, I bid you a hasty adieu.
Bye, all.
Your jeep'll be here in a minute.
Klinger, I thank you, and Nancy thanks you if she's still speaking to us.
- You know, that uniform looks great.
- It's one of a kind.
Uh-huh.
My mother made it for me for the school play out of crepe paper.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your -  -  -  -  Captain!
Captain!
Captain Pierce?
Hey, Captain, time to go.
Come on.
You know.
Ahh.
Thanks, Nancy.
Finally, a peaceful moment to conclude this tape.
The would-be Lothario Pierce is sound asleep and the 38-hour day is done.
Now, Mother and Dad I will put this as eloquently and succinctly as possible.
Get me the hell out of here!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
If it gets any darker in here, we won't have to go to your place.
- Now this one's going.
- Klinger, a lightbulb, on the double.
If I can find my way out of here, sir.
Ouch.
-  Gel foam.
- Easy on the gel foam, troops.
- We're running low.
- We're running low on everything but customers.
Colonel, did those buffoons at Headquarters give you any reason why the supplies are late?
- Yes, they said there's a war on.
- There is?
I can't see it.
- I think they should call it on account of darkness.
-  That's subtracting some light from the subject.
Somebody must've shut the refrigerator door.
These are the most deplorable conditions I have ever seen.
I would operate in Braille if my fingers weren't frozen.
Sorry, Charles.
We're all out of fur-lined rubber gloves.
Not to mention the chinchilla shorts.
A pity we are not out of juvenile prattle.
Sorry, I got carried away.
I'd like to be carried away to somplace warm.
- Got one, sir!
Ow!
-  Klinger, in this light, you look just like Boris Karloff's sister.
-  Thank you, sir.
- Where'd you get the bulb?
- From one of the tents, Colonel.
- Good man.
Somebody will just have to skip writing home tonight.
Hope Mrs. Potter doesn't mind.
Oh, swell!
What happened to rank has its privilege?
It went out with the bulb, sir.
- 4.0 silk.
- We're out.
- 3.0 silk.
- Out.
- Well, what have you got?
- Klinger's sewing kit.
All right, let me have some thread.
Anything in white.
Hold the sequins.
Sorry, sir, the lab needs a bulb in a hurry.
Just a moment, Klinger.
Haven't I exhausted my quota of sacrifices for the day?
- Take his bulb.
- Oh, of course.
We wouldn't want to inconvenience you.
After all, a man of your delicate sensibilities can't be expected to function under deplorable conditions.
Please, take this one.
Yes.
- Just a moment, Klinger.
- Make up your mind, sir.
This climbing is murder on my hose.
Pierce, I hope you're not suggesting for a moment that you're a better doctor than I am under deplorable conditions.
No, just that your attitude is deplorable under any conditions.
If that is a gauntlet you have just thrown down, I take it up with relish.
One gauntlet with relish, hold the mustard and onions.
Klinger, take my bulb.
- Do I hear a rebuttal?
- Klinger He's captain, I'm a major, that's an order.
I'm a corporal, this is a ladder and that's the bulb.
Attention, all personnel.
Attention.
Supply truck now in the compound.
The supplies have arrived, Colonel.
Glory be.
I don't claim to know much about fashion but you look like the dog's dinner.
You try and color coordinate in the dark.
Ah.
You, madame.
If you can guess what this is, you win a lifetime supply of anchovy sherbet.
- That's an ice cream churn.
- Please, no prompting from the studio audience.
Those birdbrains.
Talk about coals to Newcastle.
- At least coal we can burn.
- Where are the lightbulbs?
No lightbulbs.
Also no bandages no gel foam, no sutures and no heating oil.
- No kidding.
- What's in all the crates?
Salt tablets, mosquito netting, insect repellant probably a thousand gallons of suntan lotion.
Peachy.
You realize somewhere in the tropics an outfit has just opened several crates of parkas, snow boots and lightbulbs.
Ship me there.
I'll get to the bottom of it.
- Freeze.
- That's what I'm doing.
Driver, what ignoramus is responsible for this?
Any one of a dozen.
Would you mind signing this?
Sign nothing.
We can't use any of this, Sergeant.
- It's all yours now.
- Mule fritters!
You've gotta haul it back to H.Q!
I'm sorry, Colonel.
I'm not authorized for returns.
Would you mind signing this, please?
I'm overdue at the 8063.
Let them get their inflatable pool and swim fins an hour later.
Didn't you wonder why you were delivering ice cream churns to a MASH unit in the middle of winter?
Yeah, I used to wonder about stuff like that but it was keeping me up nights, giving me worry lines, so I cut it out.
- Very wise.
- If I was you, I would try and look on the bright side.
- There's a bright side?
- Oh, yeah.
Summer is just six months away.
- Excuse me.
- There's something we can use.
- Let's go.
- An empty mailbag.
Wrong, sir.
There's a package in it.
- It's for you.
- For me?
- Finally, an air conditioner.
- It's a book.
- A book?
You mean a real book, between covers, with words and everything?
I wonder if I still know how to read?
It's a mystery The Rooster Crowed at Midnight.
"Another brain-teasing, spine-chilling whodunit from the prize-winning pen of Abigail Porterfield"!
- Dibs!
Dibs!
- Me next!
Come on, B.J!
- Finally!
- I beg your pardon?
It took you six minutes and three decks of cards to read that page.
Two pages.
One on this side, one on that side.
That still comes out to 78 cards a page.
Nobody reads that slowly.
I'm not reading.
I'm savoring.
Savor faster.
I'm desperate.
I'd trade my soul for a laundry list.
Go over to the Mess Tent, read the alphabet soup.
How would you like a club in the mouth?
Relax, relax, will you?
I'll be finished with this, uh, Tuesday, latest.
- Tuesday?
- Wednesday?
Look, I'm sitting here reading your shoe size and not believing it, I might add.
- I'll never make it till Tuesday.
- What page are you on?
- Twenty-one.
- Twenty-one?
At the rate you read, the murderer would have escaped to Venezuela by now.
Give him a break.
It doesn't have pictures.
I could let Charles read it first, you know.
- Beej, I'm begging you!
- Here.
- Chapter one.
-  Reading.
This just might be better than sex.
It certainly takes longer around here.
- How would you know?
- Charles, please, I'm savoring.
- Here.
Read a shoe.
- Thank you.
"A sleepy spaniel ambled across the lawn past the gardener, dozing on his rake"  This is so exciting.
You don't understand!
We're running out of everything!
Somebody cut up my best petticoat to make bandages!
The colonel wants to know when do we get our supplies.
That's not good enough, bimbo.
Oh, yeah?
Well, don't be surprised if you wake up at the bottom of the Yalu River wearing a cement kimono.
Same to you, fish bait!
##  -  - Ow!
Wow!
Open-toed shoes!
Oh!
Oh!
- Who's there?
- It's Charles.
Oh, I'm busy, Major.
What is it?
Are you too busy for chapter three of The Rooster Crowed at Midnight?
- No, no, come in.
- Whoo!
I brought this over just as soon as I was finished.
- How sweet.
Thank you.
- Not at all.
It's gonna be difficult to read in this light.
Would you like me to read aloud to you?
- No.
- No trouble at all, Margaret.
The Winchesters have always had extraordinary eyesight, particularly at night.
I can see a cat before he sees me.
I'll be happy to.
Of course.
Here.
Well, all right.
Here.
Chapter three.
The Rooster Crowed at Midnight.
- Abigail Porterfield.
- Yes.
"As the wind howled through the stately old elms "Jessica's heart ached with longing for the young Randolph.
"She could best be described as a prize thoroughbred swift, hot-blooded and highly responsive to the whip".
"And yet Randolph was her equal a raging stallion.
"To call him merely virile would be to damn with faint praise.
"Jessica remembered that exciting interlude in his garden "when he'd suddenly appeared through the hedge.
"'Wench, you make my blood boil,' he whispered  "He whispered passionately.
"'Ever since I first laid eyes on your silken limbs "and your ripe, golden bosom, I vowed to make you mine.
' "Jessica knew in her heart that if it weren't for Lord Cheevers's cold-blooded murder "she would, at this very moment, be standing before the panting Randolph "her flimsy black negligee in tatters "her nakedness a golden-tinted paradise illuminated only by flickering candlelight".
It's just amazing how much heat one of those things can give off.
Yes, yes.
"Rendering unto this towering Caesar of the maiden's boudoir that which is rightfully Caesar's".
- Major - "In her mind's eye Jessica saw him aflame with passion".
- Major!
- "Unable to bridle his all-consuming lust - he moved toward her nearer and nearer".
- Major, stop!
- What?
- I'll read the rest myself.
- But I'm not finished.
- Oh, yes, you are.
But, Major, he's unbridled.
- I think you'd better get dressed and leave.
- Dressed?
- Your scarf, Major.
- Hmm?
Oh.
- Of course.
-  - Good night, Charles.
- Good night, Jessica.
Margaret.
Margaret.
What Bozo got beet juice on page 42?
- Are you sure it's beet juice?
- What else could it be?
- Since we don't get borscht, even on Mischa Auer's birthday, my guess is blood.
- No!
- My guess isn't blood?
- This is horrible.
- The last page is missing.
- You better be kidding, fella.
No, I'm not kidding.
Here, look for yourself.
"A hush fell over the drawing room as Inspector Langley "casually lit his pipe and announced "'I can now disclose the identity of the murderer.
The killer's name is"' It's that blasted Langley's fault.
If he hadn't stopped to light his pipe, we'd know who did it.
-  - Okay, okay, okay.
Hold it.
Don't panic.
I've read hundreds of these things.
I had it figured out - Okay, Sherlock, whodunit?
- Elementary, Watson.
The murderer is the Reverend Homer Butterfield.
- Holy Toledo!
- How are we gonna tell Father Mulcahy?
- I gotta have proof, gumshoe.
- He's not a real reverend.
Don't you remember how confused he became on Scriptures the day of the foxhunt?
That was after he fell off the horse.
Besides, he's nearly 90.
- He says he's nearly 90.
- Uh-huh.
But can you expect the truth from a madman who's already killed 11 people, two pigs and a canary?
Nurse.
- I've a man in pain here.
- I'll be there in a minute.
She'll be here in a minute.
It's a miracle any of you patients survive.
Here, I'll have to do it myself.
The nurses are insubordinate and the doctors are lunatics.
It was never like this at Boston General.
Nurse.
- Nurse!
- What's the matter?
Well, uh, this man was in pain.
I just gave him an injection of morphine.
Now he's hardly breathing.
- There's a pulse, but just barely.
- This is what you gave him?
- Yes.
- This is curare.
Didn't you read the bottle?
- Well, uh - Oh, God.
Bigelow, get me an Ambu bag.
Kellye, Prostigmin and atropine, fast.
How was I supposed to know that was pure curare?
Completely paralyzed.
Move!
It's dark over there.
This could have happened to anyone.
Damn it.
Will you stop worrying about yourself and think about your patient?
I am, for heaven's sake.
You think I want this poor man to die?
It would be the worst thing that ever happened to me.
- He's starting to breathe on his own.
- His pulse is stronger.
- He's gonna make it.
Nice going, Hawk.
- Beautiful job.
Anytime you need a masseur, you bring the towels, I'll bring the rubbing alcohol.
All right.
The excitement's over.
Let's get back to work.
I guess we're being dismissed.
Major Disaster has it under control.
Winchester, does your immense vocabulary include the words "thank you"?
Hunnicutt, let's not get maudlin.
Bringing a dead man back to life is a class act.
- It deserves some appreciation.
- What makes you think that man would've died?
Well, for openers, he was paralyzed and couldn't breathe.
Hunnicutt, a few facts.
Any first-year medical student knows how to resuscitate a patient.
I know what you're thinking.
And  It wasn't even my fault.
Who speared this guy with curare, a passing pygmy?
Hunnicutt, I was goaded into relinquishing that lightbulb.
If you'd only open your eyes you'd see how dark it is in here.
Less light is no excuse.
I know what you're going to say.
And  If you say it, you'll wake up in Fat Lip, Arizona.
I still don't buy your solution to the murder.
Reverend Butterfield was like a father to me.
Is anybody interested in a woman's opinion?
Interested?
I could bite one in half.
The murderer has to be Lady Penelope, the woman scorned.
I knew a lady named Penelope once.
Everybody called her Penny.
I thought she was worth a lot more.
I agree with B.J. Reverend Butterfield did it.
- No, he didn't.
- No, he didn't.
I completely forgot about Lord Armbruster's nephew, Randolph.
I knew an Armbruster once.
She had a Will you shut up?
Go on, B.J.
It couldn't have been Reverend Butterfield.
You recall, he set sail from Australia and didn't dock in Southampton until two days after the murder.
- Maybe he jumped ship.
- And swam the last 500 miles?
Therefore it had to be the nephew, Randolph.
He had motive.
He was in love with Cheevers's mistress.
But how did Randolph get into the locked library?
- Ah, back to you, Sherlock.
- Through the secret panel behind the bookcase.
- Come on!
- You're just not used to deductive reasoning.
Randolph played in Huntley Manor as a child.
If there'd been a secret panel in the bookcase, he'd have known about it.
- Plus there was insanity in the family.
- That's the part I like best.
- Case closed.
- That's using the old brainpan.
Now if you could only solve the case of the short supplies.
But hurry.
The electric lightbulb is becoming a filament of my imagination.
- B.J.?
- Yo.
It couldn't have been the nephew, Randolph.
- Why not?
- Randolph suffered from vertigo.
- He got dizzy if he stood on his toes.
- So?
So, he never could have climbed out on the roof and dropped the gargoyle on Sir Winslow.
- You're right.
-  I told you it wasn't Randolph.
It had to be Maurice, the French accountant.
- How you feeling?
- Alive, they tell me, thanks to you.
My press agent gets What military madness brought you here?
I was out on patrol.
On the way back to my company I found another man's footprints in the snow.
That's good, you know.
You walk in his tracks, and you're safe from the mines.
- Then the footprints stopped.
- Stopped?
What do you mean?
Where the snow turned to slush.
I stood there a while in his last clear step.
I was afraid to move.
But it was so cold anything had to be better than standing there freezing to death.
I was wrong.
I took one, maybe two steps.
That was it.
- Better get some sleep.
- Thanks, Doc.
Well, Pierce.
Not one witticism about the criminal returning to the scene of the crime?
Not that, uh Not that you wouldn't be somewhat justified.
- I admit that what I did to that boy was totally inexcusable.
- Uh-huh.
Well, per perhaps not totally.
After all, I had been in surgery for 14 straight hours.
And it was dark in there.
But is that any excuse for misreading a label?
I said, "Is that any excuse for misreading a label"?
Not really.
If that man had died his blood would be on my hands.
You might at least acknowledge that it takes a courageous man to admit when he's wrong.
You might at least say something!
- What do you want from me?
- At the moment, simple acknowledgement.
If you wanna vacuum your conscience, why don't you go see Father Mulcahy?
He's offering absolution right around the corner.
Why are you so unfeeling about my feelings?
I don't give a damn about your feelings.
A man almost dies, and all you can think about is how it affects you.
- Only you.
- Now, just a minute.
You wanna know why you can't work in the dark?
There's no limelight.
Without an audience, a patient means nothing to you.
You just don't care.
- I care enough to be brilliant at what I do.
- Yeah, fine.
- Technically, you're among the best around.
- Ah!
Now we're getting somewhere.
But if I were hurt, I'd want Hunnicutt or Potter to work on me.
- But if you say I'm that good - They'd bust a gut to save a life.
- You wouldn't even work up a sweat.
- I was sweating when I saved that boy's life with my scalpel.
You didn't start to sweat until after you'd used the hypodermic.
- Envy, isn't it, Pierce?
- Envy?
It's envy.
I saw it at the beginning.
You envy my skill, my expertise.
- All I envy is your chutzpah.
- Don't you spit at me.
You sanctimonious Back Bay That's enough!
Do you deny calling me a superior surgeon?
Not quite.
I called you a superior sturgeon.
You're the biggest lox in Korea.
Will you forget about him?
I finally found the solution to The Rooster Crowed at Midnight.
- Charles did it.
- Stop already.
I've really solved it.
I've had enough of your deductive reasoning.
All right.
I admit some of my deduces were wild.
But no more guesses.
This time we go straight to the source.
You mean we're being transferred to Huntley Manor?
- I'll need new boots for the moors.
- All we have to do is call the author.
According to the jacket blurb, Abigail Porterfield has been living in Sydney, Australia for the past 60 years.
Sixty years?
How old is she?
- Ninety-seven.
- We better hurry.
Miss Porterfield?
She's alive.
Miss Porterfield, my name is B.J. Hunnicutt.
I'm a doctor serving with the U.S. Army in Korea.
I No.
No.
I've never met Dr. Sun Yat-sen.
Because he's Chinese and he died over 30 years ago.
Yes, ma'am.
It's a tragedy.
Miss Port No, I wouldn't know where to send flowers.
She's not getting any younger.
Don't keep us in suspenders.
Ask her who did it.
Miss Porterfield, we've all been enjoying your book The Rooster Crowed at Midnight, very much.
Who's the murderer?
Yes, ma'am.
Your book.
The Rooster Crowed at Midnight.
But our copy of the book is missing the last page.
We were wondering if you'd pass on the solution to us.
- Don't say "pass on".
- Quiet.
The American dentist?
- Oh, right.
- Hallelujah.
Ma'am, there's no American dentist in the book.
- Oh, not so right.
- Yes, I'm sure of it.
This one takes place at Huntley Manor, remember?
Eleven people are murdered, starting with old man Cheevers.
Yes, yes, yes, that's the one.
The Rooster Crowed at Midnight.
Right.
Uh-huh.
Oh, really?
- Really?
Why?
- Who?
Who?
- Really?
Why?
Why'd he do it?
- Who is it?
- Come on.
- Uh-huh.
I get Oh, that's terr Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Miss Porterfield.
It's been terrific talk No.
No, ma'am.
- No, ma'am, I never met Pearl Buck either.
- Come on.
Thank you, Miss Porterfield.
You take care of yourself.
Please.
Bye.
- Who?
Who?
Who?
- Mr. Cheevers's stepson, Avery Updike.
I knew he wasn't the loving offspring he pretended to be.
You're right, sir.
His eyes were too close together.
- That's a good motive.
- It was the will.
He was going to eliminate everyone that stood between him and the inheritance.
How was he gonna kill 35 people - Easy.
Send them to Korea.
- Okay, we got that settled.
If you can find your way to the door, scram.
And, Hunnicutt, next time you get a book, rip out all the pages.
- Aah.
-  Hey, we know who did it!
- The winning murderer is Avery Updike.
-  - Who was Avery Updike?
- The evil stepson.
What was his motive?
I'll come over later and explain it in detail.
I know your motive.
What was his?
-  -  Attention, all personnel.
Here we go again, folks.
Supply truck in the compound.
What'll it be this time?
Pith helmets and Bermuda shorts or the latest in submarine wear?
Your guess is as good as theirs.
I'm sorry, fellas.
There's been a terrible mistake.
You got everything you asked for.
Gauze pads, rubber gloves, boxes and boxes of sutures.
- We're a hospital again!
-  - No lightbulbs?
- Oh, let there be lightbulbs.
You want lightbulbs?
You got 600 of them.
There's a broken heart for every one of these.
Attention.
Colonel Potter speaking.
I hate to put a damper on your supply party but I've got some bad news for you.
Avery Updike couldn't possibly have killed Sir Winslow.
- What?
- He was locked in the linen closet with Jessica when Winslow was beaned with the gargoyle.
- Sorry, troops.
- You know something?
He's right.
- Who did do it then?
- All right.
I confess.
I did it, and I'm glad.
I hated Sir Winslow.
I hated them all.
I don't even remember their names, but I hated them anyway.
- What about the two pigs?
- I killed the pigs because they were going to squeal.
- And the canary?
- He was going to sing.
- He's mad, you know.
- Yes, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad!
- You wanna sign this, sir?
- Yeah, sure.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Where was I?
Ah, yes.
Mad!
I got Sir Winslow first, and now you're next.
I'm going to gnash on your neck, strangle your lips chew on your ears, and then we'll have some fun.
- Would you like me to finish that, sir?
- Thank you.
No.
I can manage.
How's that feel?
- It's still in one piece.
- Ah, Pierce!
- Uh-huh.
- Pierce, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday and I must agree you do have a point.
Perhaps I am more involved with my own problems than with those of my patients but I assure you from here on out they will receive my constant and undivided attention.
Charles, you've convinced me.
You certainly are attached to your patients.
- You think you can find your way back?
- Hmm?
Nurse, would you take care of this, please?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Get her down right over there.
- Hawkeye?
- Yeah?
- Take a look at this.
-  Oh, dear.
- What do you think?
- You'd better dress those burns stat.
- Get Winchester to cover for you out here.
- Get her into pre-op.
Start a saline I.V.  Pierce.
There's a child in that car with a dislocated clavicle.
- Get him inside and have him x-rayed right away.
- I'll check him in a second.
- Just get him inside.
- Colonel, the principle of triage is to take the neediest first, not the best dressed.
- What's the problem?
- What makes her think I have to take a clavicle before something else?
She didn't.
I told you.
I got a busted femur here.
When do I take her?
What are you getting so cranky about?
You do the femur first, then do the clavicle.
Just get to the kid as soon as you can.
Pierce?
You called, mon Colonel?
Madame Min's mother's back at her estate.
She needs medical attention.
- This is all pretty light stuff.
I think we can spare you.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, possibly I could stop by around I'll explain to you later what an ass you're making of yourself.
- Park your carcass in that car.
- Thank you.
If Scott and Zelda drop by, have them wait by the pool.
Nice wheels.
I guess this heap must've set you back quite a bundle, huh?
You don't talk much, do you?
I know it's very lower class of me to get upset, but when the local countess butts in on a line of sick people, I get a fast case of rising gorge.
When a person you love is in pain, it is very hard to wait.
- They're all in pain, lady.
-  This is it?
This is the estate?
Yes.
As you can see, many artillery shells fall short of the mark.
-  -  Tell her I have a diploma and everything.
She wants me to change into my everyday clothes.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.
Let's see what we got here.
-  Look.
I'm a doctor.
See?
This is Lieutenant Gleason.
She's just been transferred from Tokyo.
- Hi.
I'm Peggy.
- I'm Bobbie.
- Why don't you help change this?
- I'll show you your tent later.
- Yes, Major.
Come on over here and put one of these on.
No use getting dirty.
Ooh.
Things really move fast around here.
Five o-clock this morning, I was dancing down the Ginza with a lieutenant colonel under one arm and a bottle of hot sake in the other.
- A farewell party, huh?
- Yeah.
- Must've been tough leaving Tokyo to come here.
- Well, I'll tell you I was glad to get away from that dimwit colonel.
- All hands and no brains.
- Let's hold down the chat, Lieutenant.
Major, that is the last you'll hear from me about old Donald Dimwit.
- Old Donald?
- Yeah.
What a cluck.
- What?
- Major, I'm sure it couldn't have been your Donald.
Well, of course not!
What was his last name?
Uh, well, we didn't actually get to know each other on a last-name basis.
Ohh.
But he was a cluck?
- Uh, well, in an amusing sort of way.
- Uh-huh.
- Major, don't you think we oughta change this dressing?
- Right.
And later on you can tell us all about Donald Cluck.
- What'll I do now?
- Just keep away from her for a couple of days.
- Gleason, you're at my table.
- And watch out for the scalpels.
I think your mother may have pneumonia.
I gave her some medication but there's really not much to do but let it take its course.
- I'll come back tomorrow to see how she's doing.
- Thank you, Doctor.
-  - That your daughter?
No.
She and her mother lost their home in an air raid.
Her father died a year ago in the war.
We had some room, so I just asked them to stay with us.
- What about the others here?
The same?
- Yes.
The same.
Eight people stay with us.
- How do you manage?
- Not so bad.
We have some chickens for eggs.
We grow vegetables in the garden.
There's a well about a mile away where we get water.
You haul water from a mile away?
How can you do that?
That's where the water is.
- I guess I owe you an apology, huh?
- For what?
Can I help with anything?
Can I get you some medicine, some clothing, some food?
I wanna make up for some of those wonderful things I said before.
- Do you speak any French?
- Just a petit peu.
- You need something translated?
- No.
I just want to hear it again.
I studied in Paris when I was young.
And then there was the very intelligent man from our village a doctor, used to come to the house.
We would talk in French about art, literature.
He's gone now, huh?
All the men in the village are gone, except the very old and the very young.
These people are very dear to me but no one here know La Rochefoucauld.
Isn't he the one who said, "Evil to him who evil thinks"?
- "Honi soit qui mal y pense"?
- Yeah.
- No.
- No.
Well, then, I don't know who he is either.
You know, you have a fantastic attitude.
That you can go through all of this and still smile is wonderful.
I guess nothing is all that bad unless you think it is.
- You do know La Rochefoucauld.
- I do?
- That's from one of his poems.
- Oh.
"One is only as happy or unhappy as one imagines".
You know, uh Je suis poulet a la poetry.
- What?
- What did you mean to say?
That I'm pulled toward poetry.
- What did I say?
- You said you was a chicken.
- Nice-looking taxi driver.
- That's a fantastic woman.
You know, she's taken in a bunch of widows and kids to live with her?
- That's why I put her at the head of the line.
- Why didn't you tell me?
Because when they make you a colonel they take the bone out of your head that makes you explain orders.
- We're gonna drink your whiskey.
You wanna join us?
- As long as you're buying.
You think she'd be willing to see me again and again and again and again?
- Is this your heart going thumpity-thumpity-thump?
- Oh, do yourself a favor.
- Don't fall in love during a war.
- Why shouldn't he?
Because war is cruel.
For every hello, there are two good-byes.
- I wonder if she'd go out to dinner with me?
- Love and war don't mix.
The rockets' red glare is no candlelit supper.
You realize you're talking to the post?
I might as well.
I ain't gettin' anywhere with him.
Aha!
Mm.
Your hands are for surgery.
Would you have dinner with me?
- Would you like to share our evening meal with us?
- No.
I mean, let's have dinner.
Let's go out.
- Where?
- Uncle Ho's.
We can eat by candlelight.
Uncle Ho has been bombed out for six months.
I know.
You can always get a table there now.
-  - No.
It's all right.
- We're finished.
We're done.
Tell her we're done.
-  -  - Okay.
Rest up.
Rest up.
Come on.
What do you say?
We can take our own food.
We'll get a break from the war.
I'll pick you up tomorrow night around 7:00, okay?
Okay.
If you touch one of my artichoke hearts, I will cut out yours.
Charles, I met somebody who means a great deal to me, and I want this to be special.
- Please?
- All right.
Here.
With my compliments.
And have a really romantic evening, Pierce.
Wild boar goulash?
That s sounds really, uh, interesting.
Oh, mm-mmm.
The can's a bit swollen.
You better have her taste it first.
I think I'll try the Mess Tent.
I hope our table's ready.
I hate waiting at the bar.
You'll love this place.
It's so informal.
Designed by the famous Italian architect, Al Fresco.
- Candlelight.
- Violin music.
##  - What is that?
- Beethoven.
- It's the only violin music I had.
- Nice.
I brought some kimchi and some dried fish.
- I hope you like dried fish.
- I love dried fish.
I hope you love pork and beans.
- What's the matter?
- I'm afraid.
- Of what?
- That this will go too far.
That I will feel something I haven't felt in a long time.
Kyung Soon, I'm touched by you.
By the way you sit in a bombed-out house and makejokes in French.
Even by the way you yank vegetables out of the ground and carry water from a mile away.
And I like the way you pat the chickens when you take their eggs away.
And your eyes have shot their arrows into my heart.
- That's from Dante.
- I know.
I got that out of a Classic Comics edition of The Divine Comedy.
I thought it wouldn't hurt to throw it in.
So how about me?
You think I'm cute?
I'm touched by you, too, because you care about my people and I like your laughter, your warmth.
And your eyes have shot their arrows into my heart too.
- So what are you afraid of?
- Of everything.
- Will you dance with me?
- I don't think we should.
Will you?
Please?
Yes.
What does "Kyung Soon" mean?
Does that mean anything?
It means I'm bright and obedient, but my father used to tease me.
I'm not very obedient.
What does "Hawkeye" mean?
That's just the name of a character in a book my father liked.
It just means eye of the hawk.
- What is hawk?
- It's sort of a cute vulture.
And your father named you this?
Birds like that are very big in our country.
On Thanksgiving, we eat a turkey, which is kind of a vulture with a double chin.
- We have Thanksgiving too.
It's called Choosuk.
- Mm?
The autumn festival.
On that day, we travel to the graves of our ancestors honor them with rice cake and rice wine.
Do you have custom for that day?
Our custom is to try to eat everything we see the turkey, the table a couple of chairs.
It's gonna be light soon.
- You have to go?
- Yeah.
They told us to expect casualties right after dawn.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
I have to go now.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
I have to leave.
- So long.
- So long.
I'm getting in my jeep, and I'm driving away now.
- Here I go.
I'm leaving.
-  All right.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Lieutenant, I was just thinking about you.
Major, I really don't know any more about Donald than what I told you.
Who was thinking of Donald?
But as long as you brought him up was he wearing a Masonic pinky ring?
- I don't think it was him, Major.
- Wait a minute.
It couldn't have been him.
Donald wasn't even in Tokyo last week.
- Oh.
- The man you were out with must have been a total drip.
He was a lunatic.
He kept licking my fingernails.
- Licking your fingernails?
- Isn't that creepy?
It was him!
It was him!
It was him!
It was Donald!
It was him!
Captain, that lady you examined the one with pneumonia?
- She's taken a turn.
They think she's dying.
- Oh, God.
- They want you right away.
- I can't.
I'm trying to put this kid's spine back together.
- There's a little boy waiting outside.
What'll I tell him?
- Tell him I'll be there soon.
- Have a jeep waiting for me.
Retractor.
- Retractor.
Why does everything bad always happen at once around here?
- You probably like to hunt and fish, don't you?
- I beg your pardon?
Well, what was the attraction?
Are you athletic?
Firm muscles, is that it?
As far as I know, all I have is firm fingernails.
- What the hell is going on?
-  Major, would you get on the phone see what's holding up our shipment of hemostats?
- I'll have someone do it immediately.
- I'd rather you did it.
- I'm rather busy right now.
- I'd really rather you did it, Major.
- Certainly, Colonel.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Okay, okay.
I get the point.
I'll straighten her out later.
Thank you, Colonel.
I couldn't leave.
I was in surgery.
- I know.
- I'm so sorry.
She kept asking for you, you know in that demanding tone that she has.
That she had.
Colonel Potter, there was no reason to transfer Lieutenant Gleason.
I can handle my personal feelings about her.
Look, Margaret.
I once had a beautiful gelding could jump over a fence as easily as you could step over a crack in the sidewalk.
Only trouble was, every time the horse saw my wife's blue Pontiac he tried to jump over it.
Now, one of 'em had to go.
I could've shot the horse divorced my wife, or sold the car.
- What do you think I did?
- You could've painted the car.
You know, I never thought of that.
Anyway, you're more important to me than Gleason was so I had her transferred, period.
Well, I guess it's over and done with.
I told them to send her as far away from here as they could.
Not Tokyo?
Gee, I never stopped to think about it.
You never You I should've shot the horse.
Kyung Soon, you wanna answer me?
I stay in this place because it was my mother's house, out of respect for her.
- Even there's nothing left of it.
- All right.
So you won't stay in this house anymore.
Why do you have to leave Ouijongbu?
How can I stay here?
How can I do that to the children?
I can't even let them play in the fields because of the land mines.
In another two years, the boys would learn to be thieves, and the girls What do you think will happen to the girls?
So where will you take them?
There's a missionary school in the South, near Changnyeong.
At least they get an education there.
- How will you live down there?
- I've sold everything we had of any value.
Some silver.
That dress I had.
The phonograph.
- You sold the phonograph?
- And I traded the car for a pair of oxen.
- Why?
- A car needs gasoline but the oxen can eat grass at the side of the road.
- You're being awfully practical.
- I thought you liked that about me.
The way I dug for vegetables and carried water.
Kyung Soon, how can you leave?
How can I stay?
##  Look, out of this whole war, at least there are two weeks you won't wanna forget.
- Doesn't that help?
- Would it help you?
No.
I guess not.
Charles, do you have to poison the air with that smell?
Why don't you go on over to Rosie's, let her fix you some Korean food?
Because the only thing capable of consuming Korean food has four wheels and flies.
All right.
- Where's my steak?
- It is now a Korean welcome mat.
- You lunatic!
- You better take a walk, or I'm gonna make you eat that.
You haven't the courage to confront a man face-to-face.
You attack his meat behind his back.
- Charles - Colonel Potter!
I can't let her go.
Let her go.
Do you have room for this?
Yes.
Thank you.
- Do you know what record this is?
- Yeah.
I wanna tell you how much it's meant to me having you come into my life but there aren't words for it.
- Will you write me?
- Of course I will.
Long letters full of everything you're going through, every detail of what you do.
Yes.
- And I'll write you too.
- Yes, please.
- And we won't stop, no matter what.
We'll keep writing.
- Yes.
- Not just for a month or two.
- No.
We keep writing.
I'll never see you again.
We'll write a few notes as a graceful gesture of futility and I'll never see you again.
-  - This place stinks.
- Right.
The food stinks.
The liquor stinks.
- And the smell stinks.
- You said it.
- And the war stinks.
- It certainly does.
What are you agreeing for?
You're one of the things around here that stinks.
So what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna take him back.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna let her go.
That stinks.
It certainly does.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Sir.
Corporal Klinger reporting as ordered, sir.
Yeah, I've signed about four miles of paperwork.
- Get it started to Seoul.
- Right away, sir.
Give those mice at Headquarters something to nibble on.
And l Klinger, you're out of uniform.
I mean, uh, you're in uniform.
- Yes, sir.
- Was it something I said?
- No, sir.
- Listen, if it's about that backless green sheath you wore on Friday, I only criticized it because it was too tight.
- That's all behind me, sir.
- It certainly was.
I sort of grew up over the weekend, sir.
I realized I love army life, and I wanna be a success at it, sir.
- And this is a way to start, sir.
- Klinger.
- This is another Section Eight caper, right?
- No, sir.
We've staggered down this road before.
You've got a razzle-dazzle going.
- Wrong, sir, respectfully.
- I'm gonna love this one.
- It's got a lot of reverse topspin.
-  Corporal Klinger.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir!
- Headquarters, Colonel Abrams.
- Hi, Mike.
What's the poop?
Tomorrow, huh?
What?
Yeah, sure.
Perimeter roadblocks.
M.P.s will oversee it.
Okay, we'll cooperate.
Adios.
All right, General Gung Ho.
We got a job.
Headquarters is gonna issue new military money.
- We're exchanging scrip again, sir?
- Got to.
Only way to cross up the counterfeiters and the black marketeers.
Therefore, this base will be closed to all traffic, in or out starting 1600 hours tomorrow.
- No exceptions.
Comprende?
- Si, si, sir.
I better make an announcement.
Give everybody time to dig out their old blue money and exchange it for red.
After tomorrow, blue will be outdated.
Worth zilch!
Permission to take a ten-minute break, sir.
- Granted.
Why?
- I'd like to get in some close order drill before lunch.
- Ten-hut!
-  About face!
Forward, march!
Hep, ho, hep, ho It's gotta be a caper.
- 120 / 60.
- Is that good, Doc?
Better than mine.
For your condition, you're in great condition.
Excuse me, sir.
I'd like to talk to that man.
Sarge, if you wanna arrest that guy, you're gonna have to wait six weeks.
- No, sir.
He's a buddy of mine.
- Then go ahead.
- How ya feelin', Boone?
-  All in one piece.
Nurses told me they had you on that operating table for quite a while.
He was a good boy.
He slept through the whole thing.
And while he slept, we discovered shrapnel on his property.
Attention, all personnel.
This is Colonel Potter.
- Prove it.
- Tomorrow we'll be issued new army money.
Red for blue.
Have all your old scrip ready for the exchange or the only place you'll be able to use it is in the latrine.
He's not talking to me.
I lost all my money in the cockroach races.
- I told you to stay away from the track.
- How could I?
It's in my bunk!
Hey, Maxwell.
I got 400 I won in a crap game.
Could you exchange it for me?
I'm kinda laid up.
Oh, in that case, sure.
I appreciate what you gentlemen did for him.
By the way, my name is Maxwell.
If there's anything I can do for you, let me know.
How about arresting this war for disturbing the peace?
That is very nice, Mr. Kim.
My compliments to your talented fingers.
I tailoring very goodly for Winchester sansen.
Goodly, indeed.
Coat fits good over shoulder.
Pants fit cute over tushy.
- That's terribly colorful, Mr. Kim.
- Roger Wilcox.
Thirty-six bucks.
You pay now.
Mr. Kim, I have an idea that will mean much more money than that for the both of us.
- I have a proposition.
- Thirty-three bucks.
Mr. Kim, listen.
Tomorrow the army is calling in old scrip.
Ah, yeah.
Red for blue.
That news all over town.
That scrip is meant only for military personnel.
It's not meant for your people.
However, I'm prepared to overlook that.
- In fact, I am prepared to help them.
- What kind of help?
Tomorrow, Mr. Kim, we buy up from your people all the old scrip before the deadline not quite at face value.
- How much not quite?
- Ten cents on the dollar.
- Savvy?
- I savvy.
Ninety percent profit for you.
Two percent of that is for you, Mr. Kim.
Oh, you big sport.
Thirty bucks.
Mr. Kim, I need your help.
Why you do this?
You loaded American.
Buy tailor-made clothes.
Please, 29 bucks.
Mr. Kim!
It's not the money.
It's the hunt.
It's the challenge of scenting the spoor of opportunity and tracking it down.
Besides, we're merely acting as business agents for your people.
They're not allowed on the base.
After tomorrow, the old scrip is worthless.
We're doing them a big favor.
Mr. Kim honest man.
No can make phony baloney with my people.
Please, $28.
Mr. Kim, it is either a check now that may take the rest of the war to clear or cash tomorrow if you help with my little plan.
What time we leave tomorrow?
I think I got a counterfeit bill.
Looks legit to me.
A perfect likeness of Mao Tse-tung.
I don't know.
"In Buddha we trust"?
- Ah, Mr. Kim.
- Of Hart, Schaffner and Kim.
Hawkeye sansen.
B. J. Sansen.
Are you adding to the Winchester wardrobe?
I add to his wardrobe, but he no add to my pocket.
- He didn't pay you?
- He only pay me compliment.
Holding money back until I help him with big deal.
- What's the big deal?
- All around my village, they got old money.
He make me take him tomorrow.
Buy one dollar scrip from people and pay only ten cents.
- You, uh - Yeah.
Hang on, Mr. Kim.
We'll see what we can do.
Mr. Kim very grateful.
Dress shirt in it for both of you.
- How about that?
- Charles is just what this place needs - a robber baron who makes house calls.
- It's greed.
- He's a greedy fink.
- We need a way to sink that fink.
Where'd you get all this money, kid?
Nine straight passes.
Then someone rolled a grenade in the game, and we all crapped out.
- Well, this will all be new scrip tomorrow.
Gotta run.
-  Sergeant, we'd like to take you up on that favor.
- Name it.
- We want you to play a game of cops and robbers tomorrow.
- We'll supply the robber.
- Where?
- A couple of miles out of camp.
- Well, what time?
- About 1500, 1600 hours.
- Give or take a hundred hours.
Ah, sorry, guys.
I can't.
I gotta be here to exchange Boone's scrip.
Tell you what.
You do us our favor, and we'll do you his favor.
- We love to exchange favors.
- Okay with you, Boone?
I guess so.
I trusted them with my life.
You got a deal.
- May I join you, Father?
- Mm, of course.
I want to pay you the money I owe you.
Oh, w-well, sit right here.
Thanks.
And bless you for an honest woman.
Oh, uh, don't you owe me another 10?
- No.
- Oops!
Sorry.
They were stuck together.
- Ah, shearing the flock again, Father?
- Yes.
And I was one of the lambs.
He clipped me for 23 bucks.
As a matter of fact, she was holding a straight and tried to sandbag me.
I had a full house.
But it's all worthwhile, mind you.
For the children's Christmas fund.
I can see it now.
Father Mulcahy, Bishop of Las Vegas.
-  - Ah, look who's here.
- Oh, hi, Colonel.
- Hello, Colonel.
- You'll never believe what I'm gonna tell you.
- Then why listen?
Ha!
Pierce, sometimes you can be very amusing.
And then there's now.
- Ah.
Sorry.
- I have an order from Headquarters - to give an entrance examination to West Point - Oh.
To Are you ready for this?
Corporal Max Klinger.
- You're right.
I don't believe it.
- West Point?
- That's impossible.
- God works in mysterious ways but this is a corker.
By special messenger yet.
Obviously, some Toledo politician has gone wacko!
Ah, how time flies.
One day our little brown-eyed girl is running around in a floppy hat and a beard, and the next day she's off to West Point.
He did it.
That brilliant screwball finally did it.
He's getting out of the service by joining the army.
To think that loony bird will be attending the same school that produced MacArthur and my Donald.
- Makes me want to retch.
- Yeah, how could Klinger pick a place like that?
- You - I take it back!
I take it back!
Hep, ho, hep, ho, hep, ho, hep, ho, hep, ho!
Detail, halt!
- There's "Old Nose and Guts" now.
- Oh, Field Marshal?
Sir!
- You wanted me, sir?
- Klinger?
Your application to be tested for West Point has been green-lighted.
Excellent, sir.
A plebe at last, sir.
- When do I leave, sir?
- As soon as you knock off the "sirs" and pass the test!
Child's play for a cadet.
- Congratulations, my boy.
- Thank you, Father.
Klinger, how did you pull it off?
It was my Uncle Gus, sir.
- The uncle that got out of World War I as your Aunt Gussie?
- Yes, sir.
He's, uh, "good buddies" with a certain congressman.
And catered the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
- He's a biggie, sir.
- Connections.
Why is it always connections?
Sure.
Uncle Gus calls congressman.
Congressman calls Pentagon.
And voila.
The debutante with the hairy legs becomes a cadet.
All right, Klinger.
Get ready for the exam.
Dismissed.
Yes, sir!
Thank you, sir!
I think we have a wonderful chance of beating Navy this year, sir.
- More than dismissed!
-  I'd have thought my horse would have a better chance of getting into West Point.
- On looks alone.
- Probably figured it was easier to get thrown out of West Point than Korea.
Sure.
First exam, he cheats.
They catch him, throw him out, and he's free.
He's not there yet.
They don't just let in any Tom, Dick and Mary.
Imagine, a chance to go to the Point.
Keep your hopes up.
Maybe someday they'll let in women.
- Wouldn't that be wonderful?
- Oh, yeah.
It would give a new meaning to "lights out".
Hey, Zale, where's my money?
I'm goin' on "R" and "R".
' Oh, yeah.
Sure, kid.
Here, hold this.
That's, uh five, 10, 20.
There you go.
Do everything I'll be dreamin' to do.
Hmm.
Wait a second, Zale.
You said double or nothing.
Where's the other 20?
- I said double or nothin' to 10.
- Twenty, you welsher!
- Ten, you thief!
- You wanna hold it down.
We're trying to swallow.
- "Thief"?
- Sorry.
Rotten crook!
Here.
Eat those words!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill him!
Why do they always start the show during dinner?
- Let's stop them before they get hurt.
- I hate the sight of ketchup.
- Break it up!
- Yes, sir, as soon as I rearrange his teeth!
Zale, those who live by the sword shall perish by the sword.
Aw, forget it, Father.
I'm just gonna break the jawbone of an ass!
- You take Zsa Zsa.
I'll get Eva.
- Come on.
Come on, come on.
Break it up.
You two palookas are confined to quarters for 48 hours.
- But I'm going on "R" and "R," sir.
- Would you like to try for double or nothing?
- No, sir.
- Then hit the showers.
Rest of you, as you were.
Come on!
Well, that got us out of dinner, anyway.
Shall we pass up dessert?
It's marble cake.
- I didn't bring my chisel.
- Race you to the latrine.
Oh, wait a minute.
That guy's money.
Wait a sec.
Anybody see a canvas bag?
Anybody see somebody steal a canvas bag?
Anybody ever see a captain chew up a tent?
- Charles - Don't bother asking, Pierce.
The answer's still no.
How do you know I'm gonna ask for money again?
- Oh.
All right.
What is it?
- Can I borrow 400?
Pierce, for the last time all my money is tied up in a financial venture.
Give an I.O.U. To your patient but don't penalize me for your gross negligence your bungling carelessness, your stupid I need a loan, not a lecture.
Forget it.
Yeah, he wouldn't take your money if you got on your hands and knees.
Not so fast.
Try me.
I will see you later at the exchange, Pierce if, of course, you don't lose your way.
Yeah, a fool and his money have just departed.
What am I gonna do?
I can't beg, I can't borrow, I can't catch the guy who knows how to steal.
If you're Charles, you just give the patient a bill for 400 and call the whole thing even.
I'm gonna tell Boone the truth.
I better go alone.
There's no sense his beating up the both of us.
Attention, all personnel.
Exchange of scrip will begin at 1600 hours.
Bring your cash before it turns to trash.
Come, Mr. Kim.
We haven't much time.
Just keep my shirt on.
- How ya feeling, Boone?
- Better.
Thanks.
Better.
Good.
That's good.
Good.
- Good.
- Everything okay, Doc?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Everything's good.
Very good.
Well, no, not so good.
Uh Duh Actually, it stinks.
Boone, somebody stole your money.
- What?
- There was a fight in the Mess Tent.
I turned my back for two seconds, and the bag was gone.
You telling me I'm out 400?
No, you're fine.
I'm out 400.
I'll wire my father and have it for you in a couple of days.
Oh, sure.
They're shipping me out tomorrow.
- I'll send it to you.
- Yeah.
And you'll go out of your way to get it to me.
- Right?
- That's right.
Yes.
Doc, don't try to con an M.P. I've seen scams like this before, and from higher-ranking officers than you!
If I weren't flat on my back, you'd be flat on yours.
- Boone, I give you my word - Aw, get out of here, phony!
Believe what you want.
You're gonna get that money back, whether you like it or not.
Hawkeye, I heard about the $400, and I am shocked!
- Father, he'll get it back.
- I know he will but I'm appalled at this venal breach of one of God's commandments.
I'm going to broadcast an appeal to the conscience of the thief.
Just in case, tell him there's a five-dollar reward in it for him.
Attention, all personnel.
Well, uh, not all personnel.
This is Father Mulcahy, addressing the one personnel who stole the money entrusted to Captain Pierce.
You may think you've reaped a profit by this act but as ye sow, so shall ye reap!
Robbery itself is a sin but robbery of your comrades-in-arms is an abomination before the Lord and a really dirty trick!
- That should do it, Father.
- Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord!
- Oh, ye generation of vipers!
- I think that did it.
And he who blasphemeth against the Holy Spirit better that man had never been born!
- We're a little late, so good night, folks.
- Uh, yes.
Well, uh, bless one and all.
Uh, how'd I do?
Father, if that guy doesn't return the 400, he's deaf.
Ninety-two, ninety-three ninety-four, ninety-five.
You've only got But I can be generous.
Here is a brand-new, crisp, Yankee ten-dollar bill.
Thank you.
Uh, gentlemen.
With all due respect to your national custom could we all please hold the bowing to a minimum?
Just one sort of group bow when I leave.
Thank you very much.
Now, is there anyone I haven't changed?
I think Major finish off all people.
Good, because I have to be getting back.
Thank you all, gentlemen, very much.
I hope this little transaction has helped to cement the bonds of friendship between our two great nations.
Very well.
Now you may bow.
- Ha so.
- Ha so.
- Thank you.
Why can't they just shake hands like everybody else?
-  - Au revoir.
That G.I. Joe your friend?
I only make tailoring for him.
May the seat of his pants turn into scorpion.
Corporal Klinger, sir.
Ready to take the West Point exam.
- All right, Klinger.
Sit right there.
- Yes, sir.
Ready!
Sit!
- Ready, sir.
- This examination will consist of several parts covering general intelligence math, history, geography, world politics the role of the military in national development, and the law.
- I'm kind of weak on law.
- But very strong on getting around it.
You have three hours to complete the questions.
B.J. And I will be proctoring you.
I already had my physical, sir!
- Ahem!
All set?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Okay.
Go.
And good luck.
"Mary's mother sent her to the store "to get nine large cans of beans.
"Mary could only carry two cans at a time.
How many trips to the store did Mary have to make"?
- Sir, do I get time for coffee breaks?
- Negative.
- You have three hours.
- It'll take most of that to answer this question.
What kind of a family would only feed their children beans?
Sorry, Major.
No vehicles beyond this point.
"No vehicles beyond" That's utterly ridiculous!
- Well, the road's been mined, sir.
- Now, look here, uh, Sergeant.
I'm with the, uh, and I have to get back for a very important operation.
I'm a surgeon.
You see?
Well, I've got my orders, sir.
Look, Sergeant.
It is imperative that I rejoin my unit!
Sir, the 4077 is over there, just the other side of the hill.
If you start walking, you can probably be there in about an hour.
- I haven't got an hour.
- Then you'd better run, sir.
Don't get impudent with me.
Just trying to be helpful, sir.
This is without a doubt the most inconvenient war in history.
Sir, I don't understand this question.
It's perfectly understandable to me, Klinger.
"Describe the political changes which came about as a result of Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo".
That's an illegal trick question!
Klinger, what happened after the Battle of Waterloo?
Well, uh, soldiers went home.
The kids were glad to see their fathers.
The wives were glad to see their husbands.
They ate some snails and like that.
- And we thought he didn't know the answer.
- I'm gonna get a drink.
Wheelbarrow lady!
-  - You're sure?
-  - Thank you.
Thank you, little mother.
For your trouble.
Bless you.
"Physical similarities have been noted "between the Eskimos of the Arctic "and Mayan Indians of the Southern Hemisphere.
Give three theories for this 'phenomenum".
' - Traveling salesmen?
- Now I'll have a drink.
Could you give me a little hint?
Any help at all.
It's an exam, Klinger.
It's against the rules.
Oh, what kind of a test is this?
Math, geography, history.
Why don't they ask me what kind of earrings to wear for an afternoon drill or how to accessorize those drab gray tunics?
They save that important stuff till your senior year.
Sir, I'm pleading with you.
Help me get just one thing right.
All right.
I shouldn't do this.
You spell Klinger with one "G".
Oh.
Thank you, sir.
I was nervous.
- Now, about these Eskimos.
- No dice, kid.
You mean I've washed out?
First thing you got right all day.
Attention, all personnel.
Scrip exchange will begin in one minute.
Proceed in a calm and orderly fashion to the exchange table.
Watch your hands!
I got 45 bucks of my own.
At least I can give Boone a down payment.
Cheer up.
You're no worse off than Charles.
- I hope that's one crook we've caught.
- Attention, all personnel.
Scrip exchange is now under way.
No one allowed in or out until exchange is completed.
-  - Halt!
"Halt"?
What do you mean?
What do you mean, "Halt"?
"Halt," as in "stop," sir!
- I-I'm coming in immediately.
- Belay that, sir!
No one allowed aboard till further notice.
Orders from the bridge, sir!
- "Bridge"?
- Aye, aye, sir.
I Nonsense!
What are you doing in a hat?
I expect to be a midshipman at Annapolis very soon, sir.
I think we have a wonderful chance to beat Army this year.
Get out of the way, Popeye!
Permission to come aboard denied, sir!
I've got to exchange all this!
- You can deep-six it, sir.
- Pierce, Hunnicutt will you tell this saltwater daffy to let me in!
Sorry, his job is to keep out the riffraff and the profiteers.
If I don't get in to exchange this, it will all be worthless!
Will you gentlemen exchange this for me?
Oh, no.
You see, that's against the rules.
Wait a minute.
Maybe we could bend the rules a tad.
- You think so?
Well - Let me see what you got.
Uh, those bundles, uh, are bills in hundred-dollar increments.
Okay.
At ten cents on the dollar that comes out to $40 for 400.
- Forty?
- That's right.
Boone gets his, and you get yours.
You keep this with our compliments.
Why, this is highway robbery!
- Oh, uh, Shore Patrol.
- Aye, aye, sir!
Would you take care of this man?
He wants to report a crime.
Now, what's your problem, sir?
Three fifty, three seventy-five $400 in brand-new scrip, hot off the press.
Boy, I never expected to see this again, or you.
Hey, I'm I'm sorry for what I said, Doc.
I don't blame you.
It's probably my shifty eyes and the white mask I wear.
Hawkeye!
The money!
It was returned!
Somebody left the money in my tent, and in brand-new scrip.
- My speech worked.
- It certainly did, Father.
Look at this.
Another 400 from another thief.
My.
Two atonements, with one speech.
Why don't you keep this, Father.
Take the orphans out for dinner and a show.
Oh, why, thank you, Hawkeye.
My goodness.
It was effective, wasn't it?
"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord".
"Oh, ye generation of vipers".
- There goes a sweet, lovable ham.
- Hawkeye?
Perhaps I could broadcast every Sunday.
- Yes.
A commandment a week!
- I wonder if thou shouldst.
Well, it was just a thought.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
-  Look at this guy.
He's covered with tattoos.
-  Oh!
My, yes.
He has them practically everywhere.
He has them everywhere.
- Cast of thousands.
-  Any big stars?
Wow!
Eagles, anchors, women, ships, women Look at Louise.
- Quelle robust!
- Klinger, please.
Father Mulcahy is a full-time priest.
Sorry, Father.
You think the real Louise is built like that?
- If she is, I'm in love.
- # Lydia, oh, Lydia Have you met Lydia # - # Lydia the tattooed lady ## -  Beats me why anybody would want to turn himself into a walking peep show.
-  Status, Colonel.
- What do you mean, "status"?
A striving for distinction from without where birth has failed to supply it from within.
Now, Charles, here, was born with all the distinction he's ever gonna get.
You actually question that natural superiority of the highborn?
Of course not, I was born on top of the refrigerator.
Delivered by the iceman, no doubt.
All you inherited, Charles, were blue eyes and a blue-chip portfolio.
- Ah, money, money, money.
- Quiet, he's praying.
Only the common people truly believe that the world turns on a dime.
Ah!
Ah!
I think we're gonna get another Winchester epigram here.
Some people are born with a taste for money and the rest are born with a craving.
All this talk about money.
I've spent my entire medical career in the army.
Thirty years a doctor, never sent out a bill.
My, my, you have missed all the fun, haven't you?
- Damn it.
Sponge.
-  What's the matter?
He's hemorrhaging.
Clamp.
What a mess.
Clamp, Cooper.
I think I'd better Excuse me.
Cooper!
Come back here!
Margaret, I need some hands.
Gimme some sponges.
And a clamp.
Thank you.
Some suction in here.
Okay.
What's with her?
She isn't working out.
People who don't have a stomach for this don't belong here.
You're right.
Let's all go home.
Cooper!
That was inexcusable.
I know.
It's just that sometimes it's so pitiful.
That soldier, he couldn't have been more than 18, just like my kid brother.
Suppose he were your kid brother!
Would you want his nurse going to pieces?
- I'm sorry!
- What good is sorry?
This isn't a class in etiquette.
It's a MASH unit.
We save lives 98% of the time.
I know, Major.
That's why I asked to come here.
I'm a good nurse.
A good nurse doesn't fall apart like a teary-eyed schoolgirl.
- That's not fair.
- What do you think that does to morale?
Major, don't you feel anything?
What I feel, I control.
That's a part of my job.
- You just do your job while you still have one.
- What's that supposed to mean?
That means, Cooper, fall apart one more time and you'll be out of here before you can say "Florence Nightingale".
Understood?
Not so fast, boy.
Chew each bite 40 times.
- Who's mutt?
- Nobody's.
He's just been hanging around.
Yeah?
Don't let him hang around too long.
Keeping an animal is against regulations.
Who am I to break regulations?
Get him cleaned up and make sure he only eats scraps because if he doesn't, you will.
- Yes, ma'am.
-  - You're cute.
- Thank you, Major.
- Him.
- Oh.
This is the last darn sock I darn till the war is over.
- What if it's another Hundred Years' War?
- I'll get another sock.
- What was that war about?
- About a hundred years.
How'd you like to have been in that one for the duration?
At least you wouldn't have to tell your grandchildren about it.
They'd be in it.
- Aah-aah!
-  - Yeah?
- Are you decent in there?
- No, but give us a minute.
We'll take off our clothes.
- Oh, well.
- What an unexpected pleasure.
- Oh, you know how this ends?
- Can we talk to you for a minute?
- It's about Major Houlihan.
- She's leaning on Cooper something awful.
- Yeah, so I notice.
- You better tell Cooper not to lean back.
Do you think you could talk to Hot Lips?
I don't know how much more Cooper can take.
She's havin' a rough time.
So are the surgeons she's walking out on.
Maybe she shouldn't be here.
- No.
She's a good nurse.
She's just young and inexperienced.
- Like our patients.
This place takes getting used to.
Took me a while, and I used to work emergency in Chicago - Accidents, suicide, homicide.
- Ah, the good old days.
Why boot her out just because her emotions aren't packed on ice yet?
Do you think you could buy her a little time?
- Sure, we can buy her a little time.
- And a little drink.
- Little dinner.
- Little breakfast.
- Good night, Doctors.
- Good night.
In the mood for some company, Major?
- Oh, very well.
- Good.
- Food like this demands some good conversation.
- Oh?
A little discourse to take your mind off the main course.
And how's your Colonel Penobscott, Major?
Top military form.
This war's the best thing that ever happened to him.
Outside of you, to be sure.
Thank you.
- Is there anything wrong?
- Maybe we should join the others.
- What?
- Join the others.
We're alone.
- So?
- You know how these people talk.
- Yes, I do.
They talk very poorly.
- They thrive on gossip.
Why should two people eating together be the subject of gossip?
- Major will you please stop whispering?
- Why?
Because I want them to hear that we aren't saying anything.
- We aren't saying anything.
- That's what I want them to hear.
- Perhaps, I just I better leave.
- No, no!
That's worse.
They'll think we had a fight.
Father!
Please join us.
Well, I was going to, but you looked like you wanted to be alone.
- I told you there was something cooking between these two.
- Mm-hmm.
- See?
- I wonder what this is?
- Brochette de combat boot.
- I'm glad they left the laces in.
- They're disgusting.
- They're children.
This is disgusting.
They don't even chill the salad forks.
- He's a fun date, isn't he?
- You have single-handedly taken all the whimsy out of this war.
And speaking of the war, Margaret, how about pulling back to the 38th parallel?
- Come again?
- Nurse Cooper.
- The kid could use a break.
- I've given her several.
- Heartbreaks don't count.
- She's supposed to be here to help patients, not be one.
- She's trying, Margaret.
- And she's failing.
You've spent plenty of time in the O.R. You know some people take longer to anesthetize.
- She may work out just fine.
- Maybe, maybe not.
We can't take the chance.
At any rate, she's my responsibility and it's a responsibility I do not take lightly.
Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
- Rather spirited woman.
- What seems to be the trouble here?
Oh, these warm salad forks are beginning to get to her.
- Hi.
My name is Corporal O'Reilly.
- Corporal Hendrix.
- How you feelin'?
Okay?
- Pretty good.
I saw your tattoos when they operated.
Oh, yeah?
Which one did they get?
- Hmm?
- Well, which tattoo got clobbered?
Oh, uh, Louise.
Oh, not Louise.
How bad is she?
Well, her face is still pretty, and her legs are the greatest.
- What about the rest of her?
- There isn't any.
Why couldn't it have been Betty?
Louise was fantastic.
Whenever I got the hiccups, she'd do stuff that'd knock your eyes out.
- Wow.
- Guess I'll have to get a tattoo artist to put her in a sarong.
- Hm!
Then she'll look just like Dorothy Lamour.
- Can they do that?
- Oh, yeah.
Those guys are good as Rembrandt.
- Who?
You've heard of him.
The painter.
Oh, we have aluminum siding.
Well, I guess I'm lucky I've still got Betty and Marie, my snakes.
- I'm thinking of getting a tattoo myself.
- Oh, don't do it yourself.
- No?
- You need an expert.
- One of those Rembrandts?
- Smartest move you can make.
Look, I can give you a half-dozen reasons for gettin' tattooed.
- Yeah.
- You look tough.
- Yeah.
- You feel great.
- Yeah, go ahead.
- The women won't leave you alone.
That's enough.
- Campbell, relieve Cooper here.
- Major, I can handle this.
That's all right.
Campbell will handle it.
Cooper, I know you've been under a strain.
That's why I'm relieving you permanently.
Major, I know I have problems, but believe me, I can work them out.
I hope for your sake you can.
But not here.
We don't have the time.
- I'm transferring you out.
- Major, please.
Another week.
- I'm sorry.
- That's it?
- That's it.
-  Major, I need help here.
- Take his arm.
- Okay.
It's all right, soldier.
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.
"I therefore recommend that Nurse Sandra Cooper be transferred immediately.
Respectfully, Major Margaret Houlihan".
You're one lollapalooza, Major.
- Oh, Radar?
- Yes, sir.
- Would you tell Maj.
Houlihan - I told Maj.
Houlihan you wanted to see her.
You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- Uh, Colonel?
- Yes?
- What do you think about gettin' a tattoo?
- Why, do I need one?
- Not you, sir.
Me, sir.
- Oh, oh.
- A panther or a Marie?
- A what?
- A panther or a Oh, never mind, sir.
- Radar, leave the tattoos to the navy.
- Why, sir?
Don't you like 'em?
They're dumb.
Back in World War I, I had a friend your age got himself tattooed.
Put his girlfriend's face smack dab in the middle of his chest.
- Gee, that's swell.
- Swell.
Couple of years later he sprouted hair on his chest, turned her into the bearded lady.
- Wow, that's awful.
- Look, son, what do you need a tattoo for?
Five years from now, you'll want to get rid of that panther.
- What do you do?
Shoot 'im?
- You're right, sir.
I won't get a panther.
I'll get a girl.
- Just get Major Houlihan, will ya?
- I'm on my way.
Here.
Don't turn me in for this.
Okay?
- Colonel wants to see ya.
- Good.
Uh, ma'am, you mind if I ask you a question about your husband's body?
- What?
- Does it have any tattoos on it anywhere?
You're sick!
Request denied.
She stays.
- Did I hear you correctly?
- I hope so, Major.
I always understood the nurses to be my responsibility.
- And the 4077 th is my responsibility.
- Oh, look, Colonel.
We all know she's a very sweet girl, but she's a crier.
So was Mrs. Potter when I married her.
But after a few months she settled down and for 38 years come April, she's been a mighty fine wife.
- I'm very happy for both of you, Colonel.
- Thank you, Major.
The point is, if I had let a few tears get to me - I'd have dumped Mrs. P back in 1913.
- Cooper isn't your wife.
She's my nurse.
She's my responsibility.
If she goes to pieces every time a patient moans or bleeds, she's useless to this unit.
Now, Major, Cooper's just going through her own little baptism of fire.
I don't give a damn about her baptism!
I care about the patients.
So do I!
But she still needs our support.
So long as she doesn't quit on herself, we won't either.
Look, give the girl a chance.
If it doesn't work out, I'll personally throw her bags on the jeep.
- I'll give her a chance if that's an order.
- Then it's an order.
- Ease up on the girl.
- Oh, of course, Colonel.
- Lord knows I wouldn't want to do anything to upset her.
-  Thank you, Major.
I knew you'd understand.
Says here MacArthur took a little walk with Truman on the beach of Wake Island.
What do you suppose Doug said to him?
Your left, your left, your left, right, left.
And Truman said, "Doug, it's all right if you want to invade China, but you'll have to go alone".
- But, Harry, with a division you get eggroll.
-  I do hope that you two vaudevillians realize that you're slandering one of the greatest military minds of the century.
- Truman?
- MacArthur!
Ohh, Dugout Doug.
You are infuriating.
You refuse to concede how much MacArthur has done for us.
He has a point.
Doug's got the whole country wearing sunglasses.
Even my wife smokes a corncob pipe.
I'm sure she was smoking it before MacArthur.
He's a scamp!
A scamp, I tell you!
- See here, gentlemen - Mail, sirs.
You are interrupting, Corporal.
It would be refreshing if just once the two of you would end an argument intelligently.
- All right.
Just this once.
-  - You find that amusing, Corporal?
- Not anymore, sir.
Which do you guys like better, tigers or snakes?
- Depends on the sauce.
- What are you talking about?
I want a tattoo, but I'm not sure what kind to get.
How 'bout a calendar?
At least for a year it'll be useful.
Make it a tie.
No restaurant'll ever refuse you.
You must have an opinion on this, Charles.
- Well - Epigram time.
As a matter of fact, tattoos are the common man's way of investing in art.
- There.
Have them tattoo that on your chest.
- Radar, you're not serious.
Oh, yeah.
I'm gettin' a tattoo over at Rosie's bar after chow tonight.
- Why a tattoo all of a sudden?
- 'Cause I'm tired of bein' a nobody.
I want to be the object of respect, fear and sex.
All you're gonna be the object of is scorn, ridicule and tittering.
Why would anybody want to hang a picture on his body - that he wouldn't be caught dead hanging on his wall?
- Gentlemen!
- Don't interfere with this boy's freedom of expression.
- Yeah!
It is the inalienable right of every human being to make a fool of himself.
- And he oughta know.
- Thanks a lot, sirs.
You helped me make up my mind.
- What's it gonna be?
- When I get there, I'll definitely flip a coin.
-  - Radar, if you're really gonna go through with this - at least let us meet you there when you have it done.
- So you can razz me some more?
No, Radar.
We just want to make sure conditions are as antiseptic as possible.
- Oh, yeah.
Good.
- Now we promise, no more needling.
Oh, I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to say that.
It just came out.
It was an accident.
I knew you were watching me before I turned around.
- Should I go pack?
- I'm afraid not.
Colonel Potter doesn't want you transferred.
He seems to think there's hope for you.
- I guess he's just an old softie.
- He can afford to be.
He doesn't work as closely with you as I do.
- Does this mean that you're getting off my back?
- For the moment.
Oh, but don't worry.
Colonel Potter'll change his mind.
One day he'll be resecting a bowel and he'll yell for suction and retraction and there won't be anybody there to give it to him because you'll be God knows where crying your eyes out.
- That won't happen, Major.
- Oh?
I won't give you the satisfaction.
From now on, I'm going to be just as tough and unfeeling as you are.
- Well, Radar, what's it gonna be?
- Think it oughta be "Mother".
Two Scotch on the rocks and a grape Nehi for the expectant mother.
- No, I'll have a beer.
- What?
No grape Nehi?
Guys with tattoos always drink beer.
Radar, you know anybody who's got a tattoo?
- Just the guy over at post-op.
- Anybody else?
Uh, no.
Guys with tattoos don't pal around with guys like me.
I think you ought to get a second opinion.
Uh, anybody here got a tattoo?
Yeah, I got a few.
What's it to ya?
Our friend here could use some advice from the man who owns one.
- Sure.
What do you wanna know, pal?
- I was wondering what to get.
- What do you have?
- Several.
- Wow!
- Marine emblem.
Semper fidelis.
- Latin for "always faithful".
- I'd want to meet the girl first.
- Sergeant, can we buy you a drink?
- Yeah.
Another grape Nehi.
- You like grape Nehi too?
- Hate it.
I'm not allowed to drink booze.
- How come?
- On account of my mother.
- What?
You promised her you wouldn't drink?
- No.
She gave me hepatitis.
See "Mother"?
I got it from a dirty needle in Seoul.
- I can't touch another drop for six months.
- Wow!
If the hepatitis don't get ya, that stuff will.
Oh, the sacrifices we make for our mothers.
Take my advice, kid.
Don't get anything.
- He said it, Radar.
We didn't.
- Look, I don't know you guys, right?
-  Right.
- Forget the disease.
Forget the pain.
- It might be a shot in the arm now - A thousand shots.
But someday you're gonna meet a cute little dame, and she's gonna be crazy about ya.
Then you're gonna roll up your sleeve, and she's gonna see that stupid tattoo and the twinkle in her eye is gonna go right out the window.
So, what do you think, Radar?
I think I'll, uh, wait a little.
Oh, hiya, Sarge.
Glad you found 'em.
He was lookin' all over for you guys.
- Klinger!
- Oh, I see!
So you guys didn't know each other, huh?
You said you weren't gonna butt in!
- It's dangerous.
- We were trying to save your skin.
- O'Reilly.
Corporal O'Reilly.
- Yeah!
- You're next.
- Okay.
I'm gonna get it, and it's gonna be a snake.
Huh huh!
I think.
Klinger, you're next.
- Me?
- Yeah.
We're gonna tattoo a zipper on your mouth.
- So they all left together.
- Oh, no!
- Are you gonna finish that?
- No.
Why?
You actually want more of this stuff?
- Not for me.
I'm collecting scraps for the puppy.
- Oh, didn't you hear?
- Hear what?
- He was killed this morning.
- Oh, no.
How?
- Ran in front of a jeep.
- Aw, gee, that's a shame.
- Somebody should've tied him up.
Why'd they let a dog run loose around here anyway?
- I'm gonna wash my hair.
I'll see ya later.
- Save some hot water for me.
- Where'd he come from?
- Nobody knows.
Hejust strolled in here one day.
- Klinger was feeding him.
- See ya later.
- Can I use your nail polish?
- Sure.
Which color?
- Peach.
- Peach?
Okay.
I think the red'd look better.
Right this way.
We have a lovely table for one with a view of the mosquito netting.
Margaret.
Aren't you staying for the floor show?
The cook's gonna confess.
- Excuse me, please.
- Hey, are you okay?
- Leave me alone!
- What's your hurry?
Let's talk a little.
- What do you want?
- You look all choked up.
I don't think it's the food.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Anyway, it's none of your business.
It might help to talk.
Look, two ears, no waiting.
Will you stop annoying me?
Fine!
I thought something was bothering you, and I wanted to help.
You're always trying to get into my head when there's nothing there.
Look, Margaret, sooner or later, this place gets to everybody.
I don't fall over, Captain.
Everything around here will be just fine if there's a little less leaning and a lot more leadership.
We need obedience.
We need discipline, not this chaos.
Doctors like you constantly out of uniform, nurses who don't belong in uniforms - dogs running around loose in camp.
- Dogs?
They're getting run over by jeeps.
- Get out of here!
- No, your emotions are all churned up.
You're not doing yourself a favor keeping a cork on it.
Let it out.
Let out what?
There is nothing to let out!
I'm not churned up.
I'm not emotional.
If you wanna cork something, go cork your mouth.
Go, go.
- Will you just get out - Margaret, I saw you sneaking food to that dog all week.
This morning he got run over.
You trying to tell me you're not upset by that?
I've got people dying all around me.
You think I'd get upset because a dog gets run over?
Why should I get upset about a about a little dog?
- How's he doing?
- Much better.
He's resting.
- Cooper - Yes?
I've been a little rough on you.
I want you to know that I'm sorry.
- You mean that, Major?
- Yes, I do.
This place gets to everybody, and sooner or later, you can't help but let it out.
That's very understanding of you, Major.
Thank you.
Why the change?
None of your business.
Just get back to work, and don't let it get to you.
I won't, Major.
- Come on, Radar!
Show it to us.
- Not now.
I'm busy working.
- When you work, you should roll up your sleeves.
- So we can see your tattoo.
- That won't do it, sir.
- Must be on his chest.
- Radar, take off your shirt.
- That won't do it either.
Heh!
Radar, did you tattoo your tush?
I didn't want you guys talkin' me out of it, and I didn't want anybody to see it either.
- Radar, we're not just anybody.
We're your comrades in arms.
- Your bosom buddies.
Aw, come on!
A person has a right to their own nudeness.
That doesn't even make sense.
You dropped your pants for the tattooist.
- He's a stranger.
We're family.
- More than that, we're doctors.
We need to check for infection.
Oh, no, no, no.
- Radar, let's see it.
- No, sir, sir.
Corporal, and for the time being you still are a corporal, let me remind you of one thing As your commanding officer, it's my duty to inspect any part of this camp.
Colonel, do you mean to tell me that I'm gonna have to Drop 'em.
Oh, boy.
- Okay.
But this is under protest.
- Understood.
- Wow!
- Betcha it's the Mona Lisa.
- With that smile?
- There!
Well, I'll be hornswoggled!
- Will you look at that?
- This is embarrassing.
- It's a teddy bear.
- But it's so tiny!
Well, he didn't want anything ostentatious.
- I didn't want anything showy either.
- Well, you did it, Radar.
- No "butts" about it.
- You're gonna have to live with that for the rest of your life.
- No, no, it'll come off.
- Only when the bottom drops out.
No, I was afraid of that dirty needle, and I had him draw it on with ink.
- It'll come off when I take a bath.
- My God, it is permanent.
- Oh, Radar?
-  Yes, sir?
-  - Did you send out those Uh, yeah.
I did sir.
I mailed out the forms three days ago.
- Thank you.
- Uuh!
-  - You had me worried.
Thought you were havin' an attack.
- So now it's body building.
- At least muscles are something you can really show off.
Yeah, but you wind up being a slave to your body.
Then you get tired of lifting weights and all those muscles turn into flab overnight.
Chuck it, Radar.
- Think I will, sir.
- Good boy.
Now, if you really want to do some lifting go to the Mess Tent and lift some of those oatmeal cookies.
- You know, the ones with the stale raisins.
- Ones with the stale raisins.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Attention, all personnel.
More Olympic results from Helsinki.
In the men's water polo competition, the U.S. Splashed to a fourth-place finish.
I wonder what they give you for fourth place.
They name you Miss Congeniality.
Hey, mind if I sit down?
I don't know.
Who's behind that food?
- Join us, Ames.
Just put the tray down easy.
- Come on, you guys.
Lay off.
I got enough troubles without hearin' from you two.
Care to spill 'em between bites?
The army's kicking me out.
They say I'm too fat to be a good soldier.
- Maybe they're just trying to save on food.
- I've been in for 15 years.
Now I'm gonna lose my job, my pension, everything.
Damn army.
You want your bacon?
I got a great idea: Don't eat.
Look, I'm too far gone.
I only got 10 days until my orders come in.
What's the difference if I'm 20 pounds overweight or 30?
Beej, I don't believe Ames here is familiar with the amazing Pierce-Hunnicutt quick-loss plan.
- Huh?
- It's famous.
Simple diet and exercise.
Twenty pounds in 10 days.
If not completely satisfied, your blubber cheerfully refunded.
What do you say?
- You know, I'd appreciate that a whole lot.
- Okay.
Here's step number one.
- That hurts.
- You look thinner already.
Hey, you're in luck.
No one's touched the chipped beef.
Here.
Eat it before it curls my nose hairs.
- Ah, ah, ah.
- Ah, ah.
- Take it away, Klinger.
- Sarge!
How can you resist that rich, gray slop?
It's either lose weight or be thrown out of the army.
Wait a minute.
- They can discharge you for being fat?
-  Yeah.
Let me at it!
Let me at it!
You're a lucky dog, Penobscott.
Manila's a swell spot for "R" and "R".
When you get there, first place you wanna go What?
Okay.
I'll tell her.
Heh heh!
Adios.
Colonel, I understand there is a phone call from my husband.
- Make that a "was," Major.
Penobscott couldn't wait all day.
- Oh, rats!
- Did he leave a message?
- He says he wants to spend as much "R" and "R" with you as he can.
- That's why he'll be here Friday to pick you up.
- Donald's coming here?
- Oh, don't worry.
We'll dust.
- Oh, that big, thoughtful hunk of bear!
Well put.
Now, listen, Major.
When you get to Manila, first place you wanna go Oh, thank you, Colonel.
Thank you so much.
First place you wanna go is the Blue Machete Cafe.
You'll love it, Major.
Around post-op to the nurses' quarters, past the Mess Tent.
That's past the Mess Tent, not through the Mess Tent.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- Ready.
Go!
Keep your knees up.
How can a guy eat that much?
- He should be transferred to the nearest famine.
- We're wasting our time here.
We could be in Helsinki training track stars and chasing Viking women.
Hmm.
Speaking of which, Father Mulcahy gave me great odds on Zatopek in the marathon.
- You bet on Zatopek?
- Of course.
He's already won two long races.
That's what I mean.
He's all tired out.
Now he's gotta run a marathon Ha!
Hawkeye, what you know about sports would fit on the tip of a javelin.
- Oh, yeah?
What makes you such an expert?
- My two varsity letters.
Two letters and a scholarship.
You?
An athletic scholarship?
That's right.
The coach's daughter paid me to leave her alone.
Can't go no more.
- You're doin' great, champ.
Lookin' good.
- Thank you, sir.
You know, we're making tremendous progress here.
Colonel, I'd like to speak to you.
Whew!
Klinger, what is that?
A pungent yet satisfying delicacy of my native land.
You wanna hunk?
Eh!
Right shoulder arms with that.
All right, whistle beak.
Lay it out for me, extra quick.
Sixty more pounds, and I'm homeward bound.
- You're gonna eat your way to a discharge.
- I call it "food for freedom".
- I call it "suicide by salami".
- I'll take my chances.
- Okay.
When you can't get through that door, come see me.
- I'll be wearing a size 30.
Colonel, an ambulance has turned over in the compound.
You better come on the double.
- Anybody hurt?
- The driver was a bit shaken up, but he'll be all right.
- No one else inside?
- No.
- Thank God.
- I already did.
All right, buffalo breath.
Let's move.
Keep that thing downwind.
Oh, boy.
When are these drivers gonna learn this isn't the Indy 500?
Well, it looks like we got enough bodies here.
Let's get this horse on his feet.
Sir!
Can I go slip into something more comfortable?
Move one step, and you'll need that salami for a cane.
- Go ahead, Margaret.
You push.
I'll grunt.
- Wimp!
- On the count of three, we heave.
- I may heave on two.
- Pierce, there's a space here.
- What's wrong with you, sad sack?
Oh, well, Colonel, it's, uh, my hands.
Um, I can't afford to, uh, catch them on anything.
Get in there before we use you as a crowbar.
I'll get over here by the cross.
Okay, let's go.
Uno, dos, tres, heave!
All right.
This time let's mean it.
Ready?
- Heave!
-  Klinger, your heart isn't in this.
- No, but his breath sure is.
- Wait till I catch my second wind, sir.
- Oh, please.
- My hamstrings are playing "I Surrender, Dear".
We've got enough people here.
We should be able to toss this wagon around like a volleyball.
- Colonel, it's too heavy.
- Cow cookies!
This group is limp as a noodle.
Your wonton is wilted.
Need some help, Colonel?
Sure do.
We just ran out of muscle.
Join the party.
Just over at Rosie's bar we heard you had some trouble.
- Uh, you folks can stand aside.
We'll handle this.
- Just the four of you?
Well, actually, it's, um, more than we need.
Sure you don't wanna warm up?
Maybe flip over a jeep?
- Too heavy, huh?
- Aw, it's all done with mirrors.
Thanks, boys.
Next time call us.
Don't hurt yourselves.
Why don't we go to the Mess Tent?
They're serving humble pie.
-  -  Hold it.
We're not finished yet.
You people are in sorry shape.
This is a mobile hospital.
If we ever have to bug out, you won't be able to lift a tent pole.
- I'm a surgeon.
I'm not a circus roustabout.
- You're a clown.
- You're a buffoon.
- Bozo.
Bottle it.
Starting tomorrow at 0700, all personnel will fall out for daily calisthenics.
- Oh, Colonel!
- Oh, no!
Pierce and Hunnicutt, you're doing it for Ames.
You can do it for everybody.
You've just picked up a whole new bunch of volunteers.
Dismissed.
Stupid M.P.s. Five or six more tries, we would've had it.
- Hut, two, three, four.
- One.
- Hut, two, three, four.
- Two.
- Hut, two Wait a minute, wait a minute.
- That's two.
- You in the woodwind section.
- Brass.
- You in the woodwind section.
- Brass.
Why aren't you playing toe touchies?
Gentlemen, we're all just fooling ourselves here.
Isn't that what the army's all about?
Morning exercise is futile at best.
When one arises, the body is more subject to postural hypotension.
- You tell 'em, Doc!
-  Blood flows away from the brain and blacking out becomes a distinct possibility.
Well, what it all boils down to, gentlemen is that you're not getting one toe touchie out of me.
-  I second that!
- Charles, could we have a word with you, please?
Briefly.
See, we'd like to get this over with, so we'd kind of like your cooperation.
-  - And if we don't get it we're gonna wash our dirty socks in your Chateauneuf du Pape.
- You wouldn't!
- And rinse them in your Earl Gray Tea.
You would.
On the other hand circulatory stress does aid in the prevention of arterial sclerosis - and I'm certainly all for that.
-  - So, hands on hips, please.
-  Mm-hmm.
Let's try some jumping jacks.
- Ah!
- For those of you who are eating breakfast leave out the jumping part.
Ready?
Begin.
- One, two - If I strain anything before Donald gets here - I'll kill Colonel Potter.
- One, two, one, two.
- Was it something I said?
-  Ten hut, all you mopes.
This is your C.O., the guy who set up this little wingding.
Remember me?
Couldn't help but notice that some of you are less than delighted with the program.
Well, we're gonna straighten that out.
Those of you who still have the energy will report to the Mess Tent right now.
Those of you who don't have the energy will report three minutes earlier.
Same to you.
- Sir, do anything but don't yell.
-  Quiet!
When I give an order, I expect it to be carried out.
This camp will exercise, and it will get in shape.
You can bet your chubby cabooses on that.
However, I do realize standing in line flapping your wings can get a little boring.
- From the first flap.
- So, in my usual, quiet, effective way I've come up with a little plan to alleviate that problem.
We've all been following the Olympics pretty closely.
- We'd all like to be there.
- Or anywhere else for that matter.
But since we can't, we're going to hold our own little Olympics right here.
- Give 'em Helsinki, Colonel.
- We'll divide up into two teams come up with our own events, and compete against each other.
Brilliant, huh?
Hmm?
Brilliant, Colonel, but not too well received.
I just know I'm not gonna have anything left for Donald.
Oh, did I forget to mention the little incentive?
- Each member of the winning team gets three days "R" and "R".
-  -  - Colonel, I for one will give 150%!
- Always helps to sweeten the pot.
- Pierce, Hunnicutt you mind going up against each other as team captains?
- What do you say, powder puff?
- Well, it'll prove who's the fairest in the land.
- Where do we pick up our whistles, Colonel?
- Good.
The three of us'll meet later in my office, go over the ground rules.
The games start tomorrow at 0800, and may the best team win.
Actually, it's "better" team, Colonel.
Dismissed!
Next to a good mass, there's nothing more stirring than the Olympics.
Ah, yes, the Olympics.
Where every four years people from all nations gather together and sweat.
- You know you're in for a beating.
- You wanna bet?
- Money?
- What's money?
I want respect.
- What do you got in mind?
- I don't know.
Nothing fancy.
I'd like to sit on a throne and have you cower at my feet.
We're a little short of thrones.
How about a wheelchair?
- Okay.
The loser has to push the winner around in a wheelchair.
- For a week.
- Shake.
- If you can stand my grip.
- Eh heh!
Let the games begin.
-  Aah!
Don't do that!
##  The mast colors of 67 countries and their legions of athletes stand as symbolic pigeons are released awaiting the arrival of the sun-kindled Olympic flame.
The legendary Paavo Nurmi is anchorman in the historic relay from Greece to Finland receiving an ovation as he lights the stadium torch.
##    Water to put it out!
Somebody get some water!
Now the start of the marathon, which is to see a great runner in action Emil Zatopek of Czechoslovakia.
Number 903 is Zatopek.
These distance demons are challenging the marathon course which stretches over 26 miles, 385 yards.
The struggle is too much for some, as exhaustion takes its toll.
But the remarkable Zatopek runs the classic marathon in two hours, 23 minutes, three and 2/10ths seconds, for a new Olympic record.
Take your positions for the crutch race.
Fifty of the most grueling yards you'll ever see.
It takes stamina, balance, a good sense of direction and strong armpits.
No starts till you hear the sound of the gun.
I want a good, clean race.
I know how sneaky you people are, so I'll be watching carefully.
- Remember, no jabbing, tripping or blocking.
- There goes our game plan.
If God had intended man to be in a crutch race, He would have given him two broken legs.
Just stay out of my way, lard hips.
On your crutches.
Get set.
-  - ##  -  Go yellow!
- Oof!
- You did that deliberately!
- If you can't jump over a crutch, you're no athlete!
- Now I'm mad!
- Ooh!
You  - I won!
I won, I won, I won!
- ##   In the pole vault, Don Laz of the United States charges toward the bar, up and over, to capture second.
Here's the Reverend Bob Richards, mainstay of the United States pole vaulting entry in a study of his winning jump.
Without the pole, he still jumps this time for joy.
All right, all right.
I know I know we've lost the last two events.
But that's only a temporary setback.
I have every reason to believe we're gonna go out there and win this thing!
- All right.
I'm with you, Captain.
-  - Margaret, you wanted to say a few words?
- Yes, thank you, Captain.
You people stink!
You're slow!
You're lazy!
You have no spirit!
Do B.J. And I have to carry this whole crummy team?
Now I want you to get out there and fight!
Fight, fight, fight!
Let's take it to them!
Let's cut out their hearts!
Let's win!
Thank you, Captain.
65,000 Olympic Games observers at Helsinki are treated to new athletic thrills as they watch the running of the exciting 3,000-meter steeplechase.
This grueling event, equivalent of one and 8/10ths miles puts a premium on alertness as well as versatility and skill.
America's Horace Ashenfelter and Russia's Vladimir Kazantsev are neck and neck in a pulsating duel and Ashenfelter overcomes the final hurdle to pull away.
F.B.I. Man Horace Ashenfelter hits the tape first in the fastest 3,000-meter steeplechase ever run.
8.45 and 4/10ths seconds.
The object is to stay up in the saddle.
-  Uh-huh.
- It's not far, only 50 yards but it's tough when you're bouncing around.
Now, you ladies'll ride like this.
- Select your partners.
Post time in five minutes.
-  Okay.
Take it down easy, Dobbin.
Hey, you're lookin' thinner.
Lieutenant Colonel!
Darling!
Colonel!
Hi, honey.
Pull her into the garage.
Dinner's on the table.
Have a nice day at the war?
Look who's here!
- Colonel Potter.
- Colonel, how are you?
- How you doin'?
Good to see you all again.
- Slice of heaven for us too.
- So this is Lieutenant Colonel Penobscott.
- Oh, yes!
Oh, you two haven't met yet.
Donald Penobscott, meet Daddy Warbucks.
- This is our new surgeon, Major Charles Emerson Winchester.
- Pleasure to meet you, Charlie.
I've heard a lot about you, Donny.
Penobscott, you're just in time to catch the last two events of our gala 4077 th Olympics.
So far, your little missus there has been quite a standout.
-  - What's this?
What's this?
We can't leave yet.
If our team wins, we get three extra days of "R" and "R".
- Three extra days?
- Yes!
- We could even get out of the hotel.
-  We can discuss the itinerary later.
- Okay.
Let's get this show on the road.
- You're my strength, Donald.
- Give 'em hell, army.
-  Nurses, take your stations.
- Come on, Klinger.
You gotta carry me.
- I can't make it, Major.
If they told me I was going home today, I couldn't lift my bag.
- All right.
Get up.
I'll carry you.
- Oh, no!
- I can do it.
Come on.
I'll help you.
-  - It's the salami, isn't it, son?
- All 10 of them, sir.
- Dismissed.
- Oh, thank you, sir, from the bottom of my belly.
- What am I supposed to do?
- I guess you'll just have to sit this one out.
- Captain Pink!
- Uh, oh, Colonel?
There's a little boy over there who looks like he wants to play.
Of course!
Donald!
Colonel Penobscott, I need your broad shoulders.
Stop!
Hold it, time out and just a doggone second!
- You're gonna be my partner in the nurse carry.
- I am?
- Yes!
- Colonel, this is the 4077 th Olympics.
- Gorgeous George is just an out-of-town relative.
- Objection sustained.
- The purpose of this is to build up our own people.
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- There'll be a little something for you in your chambers later.
-  That's not fair!
No, dear, the colonel's right.
These are your games.
Anyway, with my athletic ability, Pierce's side wouldn't stand a chance.
Wait a second.
Now wait a minute.
- What do you mean, "wouldn't stand a chance"?
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I'm sure it would be, uh, competitive.
- You bet your brass.
Course, a guy who was All-American in track and wrestling at West Point doesn't often lose to a bunch of army doctors.
Just a second, jocko!
Would you like to put your muscle where your mouth is?
As a matter of fact, I'd really like that.
- Pick up your wife, cadet.
- Ha ha!
Well, I guess you're in it, Colonel.
Everyone up and at 'em.
- Here we go!
-   Ready?
Get set.
Back up!
Back up!
Mae Faggs, Barbara Jones, Janet Moreau, and Catherine Hardy race Uncle Sam to victory in 45 and 9/10ths seconds a new world and Olympic record.
Great goin: Gals.
We're proud of you all.
All right.
Here's how we're gonna break this tie.
We will chose one name from each team at random and those two will run the dreaded obstacle course.
And the lucky participants are For the Pink Elephants, Lieutenant Colonel Penobscott.
And for the Yellow Blackbirds, Sergeant Ames.
-  - Bye-bye, Blackbird.
Boy, you are gonna lose so big!
The dreaded obstacle course.
First man to make it through alive wins.
Take it easy on those tires.
We need 'em for thejeeps.
Don't worry about him.
Those muscles are rented.
For all the marbles.
On your mark, get set -  -    Go on!
Go on!
Run, run!
- Hey, Colonel!
- Save your breath!
Margaret, we still have seven whole days.
If you hadn't been showing off, we could've had 10 whole days!
You can't go on like this just because I lost a doggone race.
A race!
A race!
That wasn't just a race!
That was the Olympics!
All right!
Fine!
Stay here with the winner.
I'm goin' to Manila.
What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?
Just move over!
If we're gonna go, we might as well get there.
Come on, Margaret.
It's only a race.
At the 1952 Olympics end, the U.S.A. Rules the sports realm.
The Olympic flame will burn again four years hence when, with God's help, the nations of the world will compete again on the peaceful field of sports.
-  Great to be in shape, huh, Father?
- Oh, never felt better.
Wheel me up to the chopper pad, Hives.
I want to look down upon my kingdom.
I'm so happy you're not taking advantage.
- You're lucky I don't want to go to Seoul.
- Hawkeye!
B.J.!
We did it!
- They just weighed me, and I made it by three whole ounces.
- That's a load off my mind.
- You're back in the army.
My condolences.
- I owe it all to you two.
- Don't blame us.
You did all the work.
- You deserve this more than I do.
- Have a seat.
- No, no.
Sit down.
- Come on.
I'm gonna push ya.
Come on.
- All right.
- Where to, Sergeant?
- Where else?
The Mess Tent.
We gotta celebrate.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
All right, gentlemen.
Without interrupting your knitting let me get right with it.
Now, here's what we can expect in the way of casualties in the next 24 hours.
I think that you'll find that these figures reflect my customary pinpoint accuracy.
- Hawk, can you go just a little faster?
- You want it fast or round?
The push begins at 0900.
Now, we're in for bloody, hand-to-hand combat.
Hill 403 is a maze of trenches, foxholes and craters.
- Why don't you go after Hill 404?
- It's got a nice view of 405.
- And it's closer to the cemetery on 406.
- Can we continue, Colonel?
Yes.
Of course.
Button it, boys.
Colonel Bloodworth isn't here for fancy patter from the Weisenheimer twins.
And I, for one, would like to know how many casualties are coming in.
- What's so choice about Hill 403, Colonel?
- The enemy owns it.
So contact a good Realtor and make him an offer.
Calculating a division of men supported in depth by artillery mortar fire and tanks against seasoned troops, also backed by artillery we figure a grand total of 280 to 290 casualties passing through this unit in the next 24 hours if the weather holds.
- What if it rains?
- Then add another 20.
There are 20 guys who better pray like hell it doesn't rain.
I figure all 300 better pray like hell this guy is wrong.
"This guy" is never wrong.
It's all here!
The days, the battles, the numbers, all pinpointed and on target.
- Dead on.
- War is a science.
- Casualties can be predicted with mathematical precision.
- Really?
How many times do 30,000 bullets multiplied by 400 artillery shells go into 280 bodies?
I don't appreciate your sarcasm, Pierce.
I don't appreciate your insensitivity.
Those figures you reel so trippingly off the tongue are made of flesh and blood.
But, please, don't pass up Hill 403 on my account, not if you've gone to all that trouble.
-  Silencio, Pierce.
- Look.
I don't have to listen to this every time I show up.
Then stop showing up.
Maybe we'll stop getting casualties.
- Sounds like you almost believe that.
- Take out the "almost" and you're right again, with pinpoint accuracy.
- You came on a little strong.
- Would've been worse if I had my knitting needles.
- Relax.
Those eagles on his shoulders have claws.
- Those aren't eagles.
- They're vultures.
- I sense a certain hostility in you.
Hostility?
I got nothing against the guy.
Take away his ledgers his numbers, his pinpoint accuracy I think he's kind of cute.
- Chow?
- Not chow.
- Masterpieces of the culinary arts.
- Right.
Chow.
- Would either of you happen to have a quarter?
- All this for a quarter?
- I have to pry off the cover.
- Of course.
Cover charge.
- Uh, Pierce, would you mind opening the pheasant?
- Would I mind?
My taste buds are setting a table on my tongue.
My salivary glands are having a flash flood.
- What's that stuff?
- Haven't you ever seen truffles before?
Nobody knows the truffles I've seen.
- Here you are, gentlemen.
- Oh, goody.
Mmm-mmm.
Chopped liver.
- That is pate de foie gras.
- I happen to know Paddy DeFoiegras, and this isn't him.
That was great.
What else have we got?
- "We"?
- Aren't we having dinner?
- We even dressed for it.
- Gentlemen, your dinner awaits you in the Mess Tent.
One lousy piece of liverwurst, and that's it?
Well, that's ample reward for opening a can.
You're not gonna share this with your bunkies?
My bunkies have palates that are obviously more attuned to Spam on a shingle.
You mean, you're gonna make us just sit here and watch you eat?
No.
That would be sadistic.
I will go elsewhere.
Bon appetit, gentlemen.
- How do you like this guy?
- I'd like him rotating on a spit.
- I hope your caviar turns to fish eggs.
- I hope you can't get a table.
- Bless your heart.
- I hope he saves some for us.
-  - Who is it?
- Major Winchester.
- Oh, just a second.
Mm-hmm.
- Uh, Major, have you dined?
- No.
Not yet.
- Good.
- What?
Wh-What?
Prepare yourself for the finest meal you've had in Korea perhaps in your life.
Ohh!
Why, that looks "scrumpt-u-ous".
Tonight's menu begins with Beluga caviar.
-  - Followed by truffles.
- Nobody knows the truffles I've seen.
- What?
I might've guessed.
Moving along quickly to the pate followed by the smoked oyster and a true epicurean delight - Devonshire pheasant.
- Ohh.
All accompanied, very discreetly, by a Montrachet 1947.
Ohh!
And I was on my way to hash!
-  Hash.
- ##  This is not hash, Margaret.
I'll help you set, Margaret.
There we are.
Thank you, ma'am.
To civilization in Korea.
This is it.
- My favorite toast is a poem.
- Oh, Margaret, do.
Speak it.
Well, here it goes.
"Look out, teeth.
Look out, gums.
Look out, liver.
Here she comes".
Civilization in Korea.
-  - And now, the caviar.
- Mmm.
Ohh, l - Which, my dear Major must never, never, never be touched by a metal utensil.
- Oh, really?
- Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm.
Only wood.
Of course, in such a primitive place, one must learn to adapt.
- Voila.
- How clever!
- Now, open wide and say "ah".
- Ah.
Mmm.
Delicious.
- Isn't it?
- Oh.
The last time I had caviar was with General Hardcastle in West Berlin, and we Oh never mind.
- Ahh.
- There we are.
- Mmm.
- No, no, no, Margaret.
Follow me.
There are certain things that still call for the barbaric approach.
- Don't you agree?
- Oh-ho-ho.
Completely.
- You can't do that with army hash.
- It doesn't fall apart this easy.
- Well?
- Oh, is this the way pheasant's supposed to taste?
- It tastes funny.
- Oh, Margaret, I assure you.
This is the way a pheasant is supposed to taste.
It is, after all, a game bird.
Well, I'm game too.
-  Mmm.
- Mmm.
Attention, all personnel.
Choppers and litterjeeps headed this way.
All medical teams report for triage.
- How untimely.
- I know.
Well, shall we, uh, meet later for some petit fours?
Ooh!
Certainly not.
But you can stop by for dessert.
- More Hill 403.
- Bloodworth's parade of casualties.
The sun's shining.
Maybe he'll fall short of his quota.
What a shame.
It'll ruin his day.
- Let me have a leg splint.
- How does it look, Doc?
- You're gonna be waltzing with Mathilda in no time.
- Honest?
You're so healthy, you're gonna have to twiddle your toes while we take care of guys who are really in trouble.
Just going to immobilize this till we get to you later.
What's that "1"on your helmet?
A bunch of us have 'em.
When we got off the boat at Inchon this morning a sergeant came up and chalked a "1," "2," or "3" on our helmets.
- Ones got sent to the front.
- Ah, the lucky ones.
- Where'd the twos and threes go?
- Someplace safe, I guess.
- You just got off the boat a few hours ago?
- Yeah.
This is some cruise.
You're liable to take the same boat back.
Yeah.
At least this time it'll be headed in the right direction.
- Where you from?
- Toledo, Ohio.
No kidding?
You can expect a visit from a hairy guy wearing a dress.
- It's not Mathilda, is it?
- I don't know.
I never waltzed with him.
- A pilot, huh?
- Hence the wings, Pierce.
I'm sure Bloodworth didn't figure any pilots.
Well, then this man's obviously an impostor.
Get him and his wounds out of here.
- Business is boom-booming.
-  Who knew this war was gonna catch on?
Give the people what they want, they don't mind going a few thousand miles out of their way.
-  -  That's just your opinion, Charles.
- You look terrible.
- The air in here is foul.
It was the pheasant that was foul.
- Whoever heard of eating a canned bird?
- Major, can you keep it down?
I hope I can.
We're probably getting botulism.
Major, I assure you we are not ill.
Then why are you whiter than your mask?
I tell you that bird was rotten.
- Major - We ate a rotten bird!
Major, can we terminate this nauseating discussion and get back to this man's bowel?
After all, this man's bowel i Wh Colonel, we need help here.
-  Where's Winchester?
-  On the floor.
He can't operate from there.
His arms aren't long enough.
Sweet Nefertiti!
What's the matter with him?
- Tummy ache.
Advanced.
-  What from?
- Probably from something we didn't eat.
- How are you, Major?
-  -  He'll live.
-  He may not want to.
-  Move him out.
-  Hold on, sir.
-  He's heavy.
-  Yeah.
This place could use a full-time bouncer.
- Who can take over?
I'll take it, Colonel.
Kellye, close for me.
- I'll need some fresh gloves.
-  You look a little green around the gills yourself.
Just keep your eyes off my gills and on your patient.
- Clamp.
- Clamp.
- Lap sponge.
- Sponge.
-  Retractor.
-  Metzenbaum.
All right.
Knock it  off.
-  - What was the final score in there?
We beat Bloodworth by 77 "healthies".
- Looks like Mr. Right was wrong this time.
- Maybe his slide rule is stuck.
- What do you say to some schnapps?
- I'm in.
Not me.
I'm gonna go find Bloodworth and toast him with a nice, tall glass of gloat.
You're only askin' for trouble, son.
Nah, I'm just gonna cheer him up.
He's probably crying in his ledger.
Well, look who's here: Colonel Bo Peep, counting his sheep.
- What do you want, Pierce?
- Let me have a beer, okay?
Ah, there is no joy in Bloodville tonight.
Ask me why.
- Look, Pierce - I thought you'd never ask.
In the battle for Hill 403 just to pinpoint your accuracy.
- You don't say?
- Oh, but I do say.
- You were off by 77, scorekeeper.
- I was, huh?
Don't let it get you down.
If the war doesn't work out for you you can always go back to the States and predict traffic fatalities.
- Or if you live long enough, there's always the apocalypse.
- Attention, all surgical teams.
More wounded coming in via ground vehicles.
Proceed to O.R. Okay, hotshot.
There you go.
And don't be surprised if there are 77 more.
- What'd you do?
Shoot 'em yourself?
- That's it, Captain.
- I've taken all I'm gonna take off you.
- I haven't even begun.
- Let go of me, Captain.
- You make me sick.
The way you reduce human life to cold equations.
God, I hate that.
And I hate your rotten ledger, your diary of death.
But what I hate most, you you grim reaper, is that you actually love your job.
- I said let go of me.
- I'll let go of you.
This is a serious charge.
Bloodworth says you hit him.
That's ridiculous.
- You didn't hit him, did you?
- Who, me?
I might've grabbed him, pushed him, shoved him, but the wall hit him.
Pierce, if you were my son, we'd be on the way to the woodshed.
Colonel, I've already put myself over my own knee.
You don't have to do it.
What did you think you were doing?
You rave against violence and insensitivity then to prove your point, you attack a man.
Guilty as charged.
Refer all my patients to Leavenworth.
Bloodworth isn't kidding.
Neither am I. You deserve a court-martial.
This is the U.S. Army.
You don't push ranking officers around.
- Look, Colonel - Not another word.
Dismissed, Captain.
Uh-huh.
Hawkeye.
I'll talk to Bloodworth.
Maybe I can convince him how desperately we need surgeons even stupid ones.
Thanks, Dad.
- Danker?
- Mathilda?
- Hey!
Toledo!
- Where else?
Don't move.
Let me take it all in.
- When were you there last?
- Two weeks ago.
Only two weeks ago!
When was the last time you had a Packo Hungarian hot dog?
- Three days before I left.
- I knew it.
I could smell it on your breath.
- You had mustard, chili and hot peppers.
- Amazing.
Not to this nose.
Where do you live?
- Locust and Ontario?
- Michigan and Galena.
- And you made it out alive?
- Sure.
I took my basic training at Le Grange pool hall.
In all the time I was there, not once did I see anybody use a cue stick on a ball.
- How long you been here?
- As long as it takes a tough street kid to learn to wear a dress.
- Hey, tell me about the Trianon.
Is it still jumping?
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Girls still get in for a buck.
Fifty cents if they look human.
The Trianon!
Every night, I dream I'm jitterbugging with Agnes Goames.
##  Then, at intermission, we'd steal away to the veranda and watch the kids bust windshields.
- You know, I never got caught.
- I gotta go, kid.
I'm breakin' my heart.
Wait.
I got somethin' for ya.
A matchbook from the Trianon.
Matches made in heaven!
I'll keep 'em forever.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Colonel, you got a minute?
- Only a minute.
Shoot.
- I'd like to talk about Pierce.
- Colonel, save it for the trial.
- Look, I want you to drop the charges.
- You "want"?
- I'd like you to drop the charges.
- I'm dropping nothing.
- Now, if you'll excuse me - Wait, Colonel.
Pierce is the best surgeon I've got.
What good's it gonna do to lock him up somewhere where he's no use to anyone?
If you'd discipline your men instead of coddling them that hothead would've known better than to attack a superior officer.
Bloodworth, there's nothing you can teach me about discipline or running a MASH.
Now, I want I'd like that man cleared of the charges.
Then get him a good lawyer.
I'll see you in 24 hours.
Pierce shouldn't have pushed you.
He should've decked you!
- How could I do such a dumb thing?
- I give up.
How?
You know what gets to me is I let him get to me.
I actually pushed him.
- He just may have a case.
- I'd say open and shut.
- You know, you'd make a hell of a witness for the prosecution.
- You're gonna make a better one.
Isn't there some kind of legal thing about justifiable pushing?
Here, sir.
Lieutenant Johnson asked me to give his flight jacket to you for saving his life.
- It's no big thing.
- The collar's all wet.
Sorry, sir.
I ran out of hankies.
I didn't want to come in here and cry in front of you.
It's unmanly.
- Wanna talk about it, soldier?
- It's my problem.
I can handle it.
- He saw Danker.
- Danker.
#We're strong for Toledo That's where the buckeyes all grow #  # In any old weather we'll all stick together # #In old T-O-L-E-D-O ## - Menopause?
- Toledo heartburn.
- Whose flight jacket?
- Gift from a secret admirer.
- You have an admirer?
- Lieutenant Johnson.
- The pilot I operated on?
- I operated on him.
You were under him.
Just a moment.
I was the physician of record.
You merely assisted.
Ergo, any remuneration is mine.
- What Socrates is trying to say is he wants the jacket.
- I don't need a translator.
- I want the jacket.
- Why don't you split the fee and give him the zipper?
- I'll give him a sleeve with my fist in it.
- All right.
Very well.
We'll let Colonel Potter decide.
I don't care if he goes to MacArthur.
He's not getting this jacket.
Shut up about the stupid jacket!
You interrupted a Zane Grey gunfight because of a school yard spat over a jacket?
That jacket is rightfully mine!
Major, get your mind off collecting fees.
- This is the army, not Park Avenue.
- This is Hell's Kitchen.
- See those boots?
Picture them kicking you across the compound.
-  - May I?
- Sure.
You know my hours: 11:00 p.m. To reveille.
- Well, perjury must have its day in court.
- Approach the bench.
Colonel, I don't want anything as inconsequential as a jacket to come between Charles and me.
- Winchester, it's yours.
- Hunnicutt, I misjudged you.
- You're a bigger man than I gave you credit for being.
- Model it for us, will you?
- Of course.
- Explain to me Why am I here?
- It's too small.
- I don't know.
I kind of like it.
You knew this all the time.
You tried it on out there.
It's only big enough for a pip-squeak.
- You mean like me?
- Exactly.
Not exactly.
Colonel, you got yourself a jacket.
Attention, all personnel.
Ambulance in the compound.
We've got wounded.
Case dismissed.
Thanks for dropping by, Winchester.
I'm gonna love this.
Get this guy into pre-op.
Three units of whole blood.
This guy's out of the war.
Sorry, son.
-  A severe thoracic trauma back there.
-  Shattered patella.
This guy's got a belly wound, but I don't think there's any penetration.
More pressure dressings up there.
This guy's got a skull fracture.
Get him to pre-op, stat.
-  Bloodworth.
- You take care of him.
I think he'd rather have it that way.
- What happened, Colonel?
- Hill 403 fell on me.
- How bad is it?
- Not so bad.
There are plenty of guys ahead of you.
- This is one time it's good to be at the end of the line.
-  This guy can wait.
Must be gratifying to you, Pierce.
The grim reaper on his own list.
Come on.
Let's get this skull fracture into pre-op.
-  Just relax, Colonel.
- Who is that?
You're in the very capable hands of Major Charles Emerson Winchester.
- Your humble surgeon.
- Anyone but Pierce.
Don't worry.
I wouldn't trade this private for all the colonels in Korea.
Don't you worry, Colonel.
I'll have you up and prosecuting in no time at all.
Charles, I'd stab you in the heart if you had one.
There it is.
Ribs with a side of shrapnel.
Aren't you the lucky one, Colonel?
You're about to be spared the pain of Pierce's rapier wit.
That does it, Charles.
It's hypodermics at 20 paces.
If I had a rubber glove, I'd slap you with it.
You'll be my second.
Cut the dueling and do the cutting.
Get on with it.
Sponges!
Suction!
Give me some retraction!
I have to expose it.
- You need some help?
- No.
It's under control.
I thought that shrapnel was just lying next to the artery, but Old Faithful tells me it penetrated.
All right, Colonel.
I'm all yours.
Continue I.V.s and take his temperature every two hours and if he starts to bleed again, holler.
- I'll come running.
- You better get some sleep.
You've been here all night.
That's funny.
It just seems like dusk to dawn.
Pierce, I wanna see ya.
- You in pain?
- Never mind.
I wanna talk to ya.
Oh, fine.
What do you wanna talk about?
Books?
How 'bout Death Takes a Holiday?
- Don't you ever stop with the wisecracks?
- Only long enough to make a joke.
Oh, boy, you're a pistol.
I wanna talk to you, you make a joke.
The nurse asks you about your work, you make a joke.
You take shrapnel out of a kid's chest, you make a joke.
- Hopefully not the same joke.
- There you go again.
What do you expect?
I spent the last 48 hours digging pieces of Hill 403 out of kids whose biggest worry a week ago was how to cover a hickey.
Joking about it is the only way of opening my mouth without screaming.
I know.
I've spent the last 48 hours watching you.
- It wasn't pretty, was it?
- No, it wasn't.
That hill back there, where I got clobbered all that screaming.
I'm used to screaming, but not from me.
In the ambulance bus, a kid died next to me.
Heard the rattle.
I thought I was next.
I'll never forget.
None of us will.
Pierce, a push in a barroom It just doesn't stack up against all that.
I, uh, can't see myself going ahead with the court-martial.
Well, I'm too tired to argue with you.
You need to get your rest too.
Don't go away, Pierce.
Let's see if we can settle this out of court.
- How are you, Colonel?
- Better.
Good.
Because if you proceed with this court-martial, you're in for a hell of a fight.
- Colonel, before you roll up - Son, I'll handle this.
Colonel, I've been soldiering 30 years - long enough to know a good surgeon - The charges are dropped.
No matter how dim-witted or impulsive, is worth his weight in gold.
- Colonel, they're dropped.
- What's dropped?
- The charges against Pierce.
- They are?
- Yes.
- Oh, well.
That's different.
Thanks, Colonel.
I knew you'd see it my way.
There, cowboy.
Now you know what a little tact can do.
Uh-huh.
Mmm-mmm.
Klinger, this is incredible.
Did I tell ya?
Packo's Hungarian hot dogs are the pride ofToledo.
- Mmm.
- I could kiss that Danker.
First the matchbook, then this.
- Keep 'em comin'.
- Try those chili peppers.
They'll put hair on your tongue.
- Come on.
- No, no, no.
- What is that tantalizing odor?
- It ain't chopped liver.
- Looks like you got enough to feed an army there.
- Here you are, sir.
- Hawk, pass the relish, will you?
- Yeah.
- Charles, would you open that for us?
- Thank you.
-  - It looks delicious.
-  - Gentlemen, we're forgetting our guest.
- Here you go.
- Charles, how does that look to you?
- Wonderful.
- What do you want on it?
- A touch of mustard.
- Touch of mustard.
- Touch of mustard.
Okay.
- Mmm.
- Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.
- Chopped with chili?
What's this?
-  Ample reward for opening a jar.
- Your sophisticated palate is no match for this pedestrian swill!
- Besides, it's Hungarian.
- Oh-ho-ho!
Charles, Charles, Charles.
- It's all yours.
- Thank you.
- Not so fast.
Save some for Margaret.
- This is for Margaret.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
##  # La donna e mobile Oh, what I ate today # # Pasta fazul and army gruel # ##  Do you realize that you are singing two entirely different operas, and they are both out of tune?
- Don't blame me.
I didn't write this stuff.
- As you were.
I'm always as I were, but thanks anyway.
I need a volunteer for a business trip.
I haven't volunteered since my draft board tied me up in a gunny sack and sent me over here.
The 8063rd is all agog over our arterial transplant technique.
And "gog" they should.
We're fantastic.
You know, what you need is a humility transplant.
- Unfortunately, you'll never be a donor.
- How unkind.
They heard we know how to save a leg when the artery's destroyed and the C.O. Up there begged me to send him my best surgeon - to demonstrate the technique.
- Oh, now really, Colonel.
I'm far too busy to go traipsing over to every MASH unit that's too lazy to read a paper on the subject.
You just powder your buns, Major.
I'm sending Pierce.
I thought you said "volunteers".
- I was breaking it to you gently.
- Why me?
- Indeed, why him?
- Yeah, why him?
Because he's done dozens of them.
My goodness, but you boys are competitive.
Hurry up in there!
Your time was up ten minutes ago!
You leave in the morning at 0800, so pack up your old kit bag and, uh, give us a little smile.
- I'm not so sure I love this.
- And pick a nurse to go with you.
I'm not so sure I hate it either.
- Will you hurry up in here?
- Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
-  - Ladies, ladies.
Before you go in there and scrape off your current layer of Korea we have a request for one doctor and one nurse to demonstrate arterial transplants at the 8063rd.
Captain Pierce will be the doctor And one of you lucky folks will be the nurse.
I need someone who can explain this procedure fast and simple.
Someone with good hands who's about who does not have a tendency to giggle in the dark.
If you remember, Captain I assisted when Dr. Borelli taught you that operation.
Yes, and you were wonderful, Major.
Just wonderful.
Could I take a look at your hands?
You're not gonna look at her hands or any other part of her.
I'm going with you.
Well, I think a doctor should choose his nurse.
I'm going with him.
Period.
End of sentence.
- Comma.
She is in charge of the nurses.
- You said it!
Exclamation point.
Let's put it on a volunteer basis.
Why don't I go with this volunteer here?
Because this is a nursing staff, not a harem.
Margaret, may I tell you something in short, easy-to-understand words?
Tell her tomorrow at 0800.
Now, hit the sack.
Now I'm sorry I didn't use all the hot water.
- Hurry up.
We'll be late.
- Put them in there, Sabu.
- If it please you, Effendi.
- Why should I be offended?
- Is that how you're gonna be dressed?
- I try to look my best.
You know how jealous those other doctors can be.
Here's a box of sulfa and six cans of fancy cling peaches.
These aren't your puny slices.
These are giant half peaches, big as your fist.
I thought we'd stop at a Howard Johnson's.
I hate to eat in the car.
This ain't for you, Skeezix.
I want you to do a little trading.
See if they've got some penicillin.
Don't take less than 50 vials of penicillin for those peaches.
Here, Major, before you go.
You got a letter from Col.
Penobscott.
Thank you.
Would you mind standing back?
Why?
Is something gonna jump out of it?
I don't want you reading over my shoulder.
- What is all this stuff?
- Lipstick, nylons, perfume - And a jar of Charles's caviar.
- You can only get so far with peaches.
- Did Charles mind?
- Didn't say a word.
Didn't even wake up.
You be sure and call us when you get there so we'll know you're all right.
- Yes, Dad.
-  - Boy, he sure packs a lot in a few sentences.
- Mind your own business.
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
- What don't you do?
- I'll think of something.
- Can we go?
-  He stole my caviar!
- Bye, folks.
We'll write.
He stole my caviar!
##  - Do you have to sing?
- I didn't bring my tap shoes.
- You have a grating voice.
- Oh, it's just a modest voice.
- I never thought of it as great.
- Grating.
Ting, ting.
- Hello.
- What?
It's a game, right?
Like knock, knock?
You say, "Ting, ting".
I say, "Hello".
Okay, go ahead.
Hello?
What's the joke?
The joke is that of all the people I could've driven 40 miles into the wilderness with, I had to get an orangutan.
Look, Margaret, why don't we make the best of this?
There's no reason we can't pass the time pleasantly.
Why don't you read me your letter?
Why don't you eat your steering wheel?
- Just trying to be friendly.
-  - What are you doing?
- Getting out of here.
What do you think?
- Keep moving!
- You watch how fast I move once I turn around.
Straight ahead!
They're not gonna hit anything!
They're hitting the road!
You don't call that anything?
What are you gonna do?
Go backwards all the way home?
I'm trying to find a place to turn around!
-  - Maybe you're right.
- On the other hand - Are you trying to get us killed?
Get this car in gear and start driving that way!
Maybe you haven't noticed They're lobbing shells over there.
Ignore them!
Okay!
I can't hear you anymore.
Do you read me?
Tell me if you read me, damn it!
Every other word.
Say again.
- Not too clear.
- What's happening?
What's the problem?
The 8063rd had to bug out.
The North Koreans were so close they were practically in their chow line.
-  What about Hawk and Margaret?
Are they with them?
- I don't know.
- All I get now is static.
- Can you try another frequency?
8063rd, this is MASH 4077.
What's happening?
This is 8063rd.
Do you copy?
Over.
This is 4077.
Pierce and Houlihan Are they with you?
They never showed up.
Damn it.
Why didn't you tell us you were gonna move?
Happened too fast.
If they take the same road back there's a chance we'll see them.
- How big a chance?
-  - You keep trying.
I'll get Potter.
- They bugged out.
That means we're behind enemy lines.
Let's get out of here.
Hurry, will you?
- I'm hurrying.
- Let's go!
We're going!
We're going!
- Why are you taking this road?
- Because they're not shelling it.
I try to avoid roads that are in the process of disappearing.
-  - What's that?
Artillery.
Don't be such a coward.
-  - That!
Oh, that.
Don't pay any attention.
If you don't mind, I'm gonna go into a mild panic.
There's just something wrong with the motor.
Get out and fix it.
Oh, okay.
Sure.
No problem.
I'll have this thing going in no time.
- What are you doing?
- You have to know how to treat these brutes.
I had a stubborn Studebaker once.
The only thing they understand is a good, swift kick in the radiator.
Open the hood.
That's this, right?
There.
It ought to be all downhill from here on.
Probably something very simple, like maybe a broken buckle on the fan belt.
- Let me see.
- I thought you'd never ask.
Maybe the muffler unraveled.
Or maybe the Maybe the radiator cap has snapped its brim.
I tried that already.
Margaret, face it.
The patient is dead.
Why don't we pull a sheet over its headlights and move on?
Why don't we pull a sheet over its headlights and move on?
-  - Hey.
Come on.
- I hope you're not blaming me for that.
- How can a grown man be so mechanically incompetent?
- I take a lot of cabs.
- Oh!
Come on!
Boy, I wouldn't want to be those guys when the colonel finds out his jeep is missing.
Oh!
Geez!
Captain, my chief surgeon and my head nurse are lost behind enemy lines.
Don't you think "l" Corps ought to find them?
Tell him you want to talk to the general.
Will you pipe down?
Captain, I got the feeling I'm talking to a broken record.
Get me General Roberts.
You're afraid that's impossible?
Try not to be afraid, Captain.
You're supposed to be a soldier.
When he comes in, I would really appreciate a little jingle on the talking machine.
How can they let them wander around behind enemy lines without lifting a finger to help them?
They're expecting some action in this area and don't want to send up a spotter plane - for fear it'll tip off the enemy.
- Ridiculous!
I don't accept that!
What are you getting mad at me for?
I'm just delivering the message.
What did you do the day you were drafted?
Shoot the Western Union boy?
First I tipped him.
Look, I want somebody to find them.
- So do I!
- I want somebody to start looking right now!
Stop dogging me, will ya?
Heel!
Heel!
# Peas, peas, peas, peas # # Eating Goober's peas # # Goodness, how delicious eating # Will you stop that?
- That's a Civil War marching song.
- Not another idiotic note!
I was just trying to be military.
You know, you shouldn't read while you walk.
It makes you grunt.
Butt out, you you You can't even fix a simple case of engine trouble.
- What kind of a man are you?
- Certainly not a serviceman.
- In more ways than one.
- Come here.
Come here.
Come here.
- Where are you going?
- There's a YMCA over here.
Let's see if we can check in for the night.
Act like you got a mustache.
Cute.
This place is a handyman's delight.
- A real fixer-upper.
-  I'm not staying in here.
It's a perfect target.
Margaret, some forward observer's probably using this hut as a registration point.
- He's not gonna destroy his own benchmark.
- That's right.
I didn't know you knew anything military.
I learned it at the movies.
Abbott and Costello Meet Hitler.
I just don't want to walk around out there while it's raining artillery shells.
Margaret, stay where you are.
I'll be back in a minute.
- You're not going out there.
- Hard to believe, isn't it?
You just said it was raining artillery shells.
- I'll run between the drops.
- I'm coming with you.
Oh, no.
Every time we try to do something together, we have a 20-minute debate about it.
I won't argue with you.
Let's go.
Just make sure you keep low.
Lower!
- I'll dig a tunnel.
- You know absolutely nothing about soldiering.
I do not want to discuss my every breath with you.
- I'm not saying a word.
- Good.
I'm not a buttinsky.
Do it your way.
Go by yourself.
- Thank you.
- But keep low.
Keep low.
Stay down.
Hurry up!
Stay there!
What are you doing?
Get out of there!
-  - Stay down!
Keep low!
Stay down!
Keep low!
Keep low!
What's the matter with you?
You run out there and risk your life and then you come back without him?
He's dead.
All right.
You can get off me now.
- Yeah, well, uh - You better get off me, buster!
- I think I got something stuck in my leg.
- Oh, my God.
Wait a minute.
-  - Margaret, there's no time for that now.
Look at my wound.
Oh, will you be quiet?
You're hurt.
Do you want some morphine?
How bad is it?
I can hardly feel it.
You got a hunk of wood in there.
You want me to take it out?
Of course I do!
If I want a souvenir, I'll go to a gift shop.
I'm gonna pour some alcohol on it.
It might sting.
Stop twitching!
You're making this very difficult!
- Forget it.
Leave it in.
- Just hold still.
Will you be quiet and hold still?
I can't get ahold of it.
I don't want to make things worse.
No, me neither.
No.
- There.
Ah.
-  - You want to look at it?
- Don't be morbid.
Just clean it off and put a dressing on it.
- Let me give you a shot of morphine.
- Stop pushing the morphine.
Okay, but this is gonna hurt a little.
That's all right.
I'm tough.
- Uh-huh.
-  - I haven't even started yet.
- I'm just practicing.
- Where's Colonel Potter?
- Checking his list of classmates to see who can help find Captain Pierce and Major Houlihan.
Well, I have an appointment with him.
It's absolutely crucial that I see him.
Still trying to get transferred, huh, Major?
Are you addressing me?
Major, we're both looking for that great exit sign in the sky.
- We're soul mates.
- What we are is cell mates.
Beyond that minimal similarity, there's a vast difference which I can easily demonstrate by having you assigned to eternal K.P., if you get my drift.
Relax, Major.
I'm on your side.
Maybe we could, uh, trade a few secrets butter each other's bread, if you get my drift.
Why don't you knit yourself a giant cesspool and go for a swim?
- I'm treading water right now, Major, just like you.
-  I hope that's good news.
MASH 4077 th.
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
General Roberts!
He could get me out of here in a minute if only he could see my outfit.
What a waste.
I'll get Colonel Potter.
General Roberts?
This is Major Charles Emerson Winchester.
I just thought you'd like to know, sir, there's been quite an error in assignments here.
There's someone here who should be in Tokyo.
Yes, General.
I-I am he.
Sad to say, I'm terribly overqualified for this very pleasant little outfit, and l I beg your pardon?
No.
General, I'm not wearing a dress.
No.
You have me confused with a lunatic.
You don't?
May I ask what you mean by that?
No, I will not get a good grip on my nylons!
How dare you!
Hello, General.
Hello.
- The line's dead.
- Indeed it is.
Our conversation was short and un-sweet.
- What did he say, Charles?
- That idiot thought I was Klinger!
Roberts never was too bright.
What's his estimate of the situation?
He told me to take my application for transfer and tuck it in my bra until the war was over.
- What did he say about Hawkeye and Margaret?
- What What?
- You idiot.
- You know how long we've been trying to get through to him?
I'm gonna get you your transfer to another hospital, pal as a patient!
Gentlemen, I am as concerned about them as you are.
I I was temporarily blinded by the opportunity.
I will get General Roberts on the phone and straighten the whole thing out Stay away from that phone, or you'll be bunking with my horse.
I'm putting through the call myself.
Then I'm gonna sit here until somebody can find Pierce and Houlihan!
Listen, I want to apologize.
I'm sorry I insisted on going ahead when we started getting shelled.
Oh, that's all right.
You come from a long line of courageous military people.
Insanity is hereditary.
- I suppose I deserve that.
- No, you don't.
I was being kind.
I was upset.
I wasn't thinking clearly.
What's eating you, anyway?
What is it, the letter?
- What's in it?
- Never mind!
What are you laughing at?
I just remembered.
You're gonna be sorry you were mean to me when you see what I brought.
Probably a bottle of that liquid rat poison of yours.
Forget it.
Ha-ha on you.
- Japanese scotch.
- Oh.
- So how good could that be?
- How good does it have to be?
Give me the bottle.
Is that cup clean?
It can't be too dirty.
Whatever's in the bottom is still alive.
Just pass the cup.
Do you think we'll ever get out of here?
I was just gonna ask you the same question.
I don't like the war, you know.
I hate it.
I hate the destruction.
The stupidity of the waste.
The disruption of personal lives.
- Margaret, what's in the letter?
- Oh, well It probably would, uh, hand you a laugh, actually.
For instance This is only the beginning.
"My dear Darleen" - Is that your nickname?
- No.
- Why is he calling you Darleen?
- He's not calling me Darleen.
He put this letter in the wrong envelope.
"My dear Darleen.
"How long it's been since we walked together "on the beach at Oahu.
"I can still see the moonlight splashing on your shoulders and hear the gentle whoosh, whoosh, whoosh of the waves".
His last letter to me dealt entirely with a self-loading semiautomatic submachine gun.
My letter went "clickety, click, click," whereas hers goes "whoosh, whoosh, whoosh".
- And splashing moonlight.
- "I know you've heard I'm married.
"I'm sure you'd like her.
She's competent and a hard worker.
"She'll make an excellent hostess when we return to the States.
All in all, a sturdy woman".
- Sturdy!
- Sturdy is nice.
Sturdy can be uh, quite, uh I mean nothing to him!
If I were a half-ton truck, he'd be more lyrical about me.
And the worst thing is this stupid woman with the ocean whooshing all over her toes is this minute reading the letter he meant for me.
I'm sorry, Margaret.
You must really hurt.
Hurt?
You know what it feels like to give your heart to somebody?
To live just for a glimpse of his handwriting in the mail?
To lose sight of his picture because you've covered it with lipstick?
And then to find out you're sturdy?
And then to have them lob artillery shells at you, huh?
It's certainly been an interesting day.
Margaret I wish there was something I could say to ease the pain.
I'm all right.
I've always taken great pride in the fact that I can adjust to anything.
- Why don't you get it out of your system?
- I'm fine!
Thanks for the drink.
- You want some more?
- Oh, a sip, maybe.
I'll sleep over there.
Oh, I think I should warn you If you come over here for any reason during the night, announce yourself.
- I intend to swing this to kill.
- Good night.
-  - What?
What?
What?
- Stop it!
Will you stop it?
- Margaret, wait a minute.
We're people!
You can't shoot at us like we're animals!
You want to drive us crazy?
You want us to go insane?
Is that what you want?
- Shut up!
- Why don't you let us have one hour of sleep in peace?
-  -  Stop it!
Stop it!
You don't even know whether we're Americans or Chinese or Koreans!
- Margaret, come here.
- I'm sorry.
I'm afraid.
- Me too.
So am I. - I don't like being afraid.
It scares me.
Me too.
I'd feel a lot braver if I weren't so scared.
- Please hold me.
- I'm holding you.
- I can't feel it.
Hold me.
Hold me.
- Margaret, I'm holding you.
-  - Will you cut it out?
You want to kill us?
- For cryin' out loud, cut it out!
- Stop it!
Will you stop it!
- Just leave us alone!
- Will you cut it out!
- Have you heard anything yet?
- I've been ready to pounce on that telephone for two hours.
- Not a jingle.
- If only we could get some news.
Any news.
You boys better get some sleep.
We're gonna miss 'em in O.R. Tomorrow.
I can't sleep.
I keep expecting him to walk through the door.
I've said an entire novena in one night.
I guess we'll just have to wait.
- I'm sure they're all right.
- They must be going through hell out there.

- Will you, for cryin'out loud, cut it out!
- Stop it!
Will you stop it!
- Just stop it!
Just leave us alone!
- Will you cut it out!
If only we could get some news, any news.
You boys better get some sleep.
We're gonna miss 'em in O.R. Tomorrow.
I can't sleep.
I keep expecting him to walk through the door.
I've said an entire novena in one night.
I guess we'll just have to wait.
- I'm sure they're all right.
- They must be going through hell out there.
Colonel, this guy you said couldn't wait has been waiting 45 minutes.
All right.
Hold your horses.
B.J.?
I got him.
Put him down on the end and get him ready.
- Send Kellye over here to close for me.
- Kellye, thread your needle.
- Father, retract this for me.
- Right.
Great.
Musical scalpels.
Give me a clean gown.
I hope you're shaking a leg, Winchester.
Colonel, my graceful fingers are dancing o'er the innards of this hapless doughboy and, when I am done, I shall be done.
- I'm sorry I asked.
- That's what I had in mind.
Anybody know where Hawk and Margaret are and why nobody's out looking for them?
- I spoke to the chaplain at "l" Corps a few minutes ago.
- And?
No help.
They still won't send up a spotter plane for a search.
- His C.O. Just won't budge.
- Did you tell him we're desperate?
Rather vividly.
I'm afraid my anger may cost me a few days in purgatory.
- Your heart was in the right place, Father.
- I wish mine was.
Right now, it's in my mouth waiting for somebody to do something.
You know, his abrasive personality to one side Pierce was a skilled surgeon.
Charles, it's a bit premature to be speaking well of the dead.
Colonel, did you get through to the 8063rd yet?
Still floating on a sea of static.
- A little more retraction there, if you please, Father.
- Oh, yes.
Sorry.
I'm afraid I'm not as sharp a nurse as Margaret.
If the truth be known, Margaret was a superior nurse.
Charles, will you quit talking about them in the past tense?
How would you like me to talk about them in the future tense?
Yes, actually.
We could all say a little prayer that they'll come home tonight.
That's not too far in the future, is it, Major?
Touche, Father.
Oh, yeah.
-  - Hmm.
Mm.
Well.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Did you sleep well?
Gee, I don't know.
I was unconscious most of the time.
How about a nice, big breakfast?
Great.
What'll we do, call room service or go down to the coffee shop?
Do we still have those canned peaches?
- I don't know.
I'll see.
- No.
You just rest.
I'll fix breakfast.
Oh.
Oh.
I wish we had the caviar.
Yeah.
Oh, no peaches.
- Crackers and jam.
- Well.
Well, that's not so bad.
That's all right.
A continental breakfast.
- The continent of Atlantis.
- The what?
- That's the one that sank.
- Oh.
Yeah.
That's like a joke.
Similar.
You know, I really love your sense of humor.
There have been times in the O.R. No one could see under my mask I was smiling at everything you said.
Sometimes I'd be standing right next to Frank and you'd get off a really good one on him and I'd just be grinning from ear to ear.
- No kidding.
-  How did you feel about me under your mask?
You know, a lot of the stuff that came out of my mouth and through my mask was just fatigue and craziness.
I know.
I think I always knew.
I mean, I've always felt that you were a very attractive very, uh attractive person.
And there we were, hiding behind our masks all the time.
- Yeah.
- If only I'd have known before I met Donald.
- You know?
- Yeah.
Oh!
I must look awful.
You look fine.
Wonderful.
Ah!
Here I am no lipstick, no comb dust all over my face.
Well, I guess if I could pass muster on a morning like this I can't be that bad.
- You look great, Margaret.
- Oh!
I wish I had my toothbrush.
If I don't keep my teeth polished, they get positively dim.
You have the whitest teeth I've ever seen.
Oh, l-I always thought they were my weak point.
- Margaret, you could read by your teeth.
-  You know what I like about you?
You don't shower a woman with empty praise.
You say very little.
But when you do give a tiny, little compliment it means so much more.
- Doug, have you got a second?
- Hey, Beej, how's it goin'?
Lousy.
Pierce and Houlihan have been missing for a day and a half.
We can't get "l" Corps to send a plane to look for them.
I know.
I got orders to stay on the ground too.
If we don't find them, the North Koreans will.
- I'm not just gonna sit here and let that happen.
- You're not?
- No.
We're not.
- "We"?
- You, me and my chopper?
- The three and only.
You and I could get into an awful lot of trouble, and so could my chopper.
- I don't have any authorization.
- You fly through machine gun fire to pick up wounded G.I.s. What kind of authorization do you have for that?
Anybody from "l" Corps sees us up there there ain't gonna be a sling big enough to hold our butts.
Aylesworth, nobody's gonna see us up there but the North Koreans.
- All they got is guns.
- All right.
All right.
You know I can't turn down a chance to get shot at.
Margaret, you certainly are a delicious cook.
Wait until you see what I do with leftovers.
Well, here we are two sleepy people by dawn's early light hoping they won't get shot before lunch.
Who'd have thought we'd wind up together like this?
Makes you stop and think, doesn't it?
There's somebody out there!
Get down!
- Get down?
I can't get up.
- No, no, no, no!
Stay there.
It-It's all right.
Don't panic, darling.
We'll be all right.
- It's a North Korean.
"Darling"?
- We'll be fine.
Just relax.
Margaret, there's a man in uniform out there, and he's not here to read the meter.
- We gotta get outta here.
- He-He won't come in.
Look, he's scavenging.
He filled his pockets and he's coming in here to look for more goodies.
- Come on!
-  My leg doesn't work.
It stiffened up overnight.
Try to move!
Please!
He's almost here!
Oh, forget it.
Hide!
Hide!
Come here, come here!
Get under.
Come on.
Get down, get down.
Don't touch him!
He may be booby-trapped.
He's got a belly wound.
God, this guy was out there stealing pennies from a dead man.
He's only got a couple of hours left himself.
What crazy place is this?
- How hungry can they be?
- He could have killed us.
I doubt it, not if you'd offered him breakfast.
Who knows how many more there are out there?
-  - What's that?
It's a chopper.
It's one of ours!
- We're saved!
- Margaret!
Hey!
Hey!
Here we are!
Hey!
Hey!
Here we are!
Hey!
- Nothing.
How about your side?
- Not a thing.
MASH 4077 to Red Four.
Over.
-  - Give me that.
Come in, Red Four.
Do you read me?
- That's Potter.
- Well, do we answer?
Suppose the radio's broken for another five minutes.
I know you can hear me, damn it.
Now pick up the phone.
Is he gonna be mad when we get back.
Not if we find them.
Let's keep looking.
- No!
Oh!
Oh!
- They gotta be here.
Where are they?
Listen, you nitwits!
You are in such big trouble you're gonna need a lawyer just to land again.
First my chief surgeon and my head nurse disappear, and now you.
Wait a minute.
What's that?
It's a MASH jeep.
- Colonel Potter, it's B.J. I think we found them.
- What?
Where are you?
Uh-oh.
Doesn't this thing go any faster?
-  - They got the antenna.
-  Let's get outta here!
-  -  - Oh!
Oh!
Hawk Hawkeye!
Ah!
Ah!
They were hit!
They went back!
Did you hear the shooting?
Come on!
We've gotta get outta here!
- Where's the sulfa?
- Come on!
They'll be here any minute!
- Here it is.
- Darling, will you move, please?
- There are people out there who want to kill us!
- Give me a hand here.
- You're not taking him with us?
- Don't be silly.
This is our date.
- I'm gonna give him a quarter and send him to the movies.
- He's the enemy!
That's funny.
He bleeds just like our side.
- Ah!
- My leg is coming along really well.
Listen to me.
You've got to try to walk.
They'll be here any minute.
They'll find him.
- Suppose they don't come in here.
He'll die.
- Everybody comes in here!
We came in.
He came in.
It's Grand Central Station in here!
Move!
Please!
Look.
I love how brave you are.
It's thrilling, really.
I love to see a strong man who takes charge like that.
Now do what I tell you!
Walk to that door!
Ah, my brave soldier.
You're wonderful.
You're my inspiration.
Shake a leg!
You wanna trade places, fella?
Let me tell you, Hunnicutt.
Stealing a U.S. Army helicopter is slightly more serious than grabbing the family car Saturday night.
I think we found them.
We spotted a jeep, and I think I saw Margaret.
- You know the coordinates?
- Yeah.
I got 'em.
Come on.
The North Koreans are backing off.
The 8063rd can send out a search party.
- Sorry about the chopper.
- I'm taking it out of your allowance.
- I like my men neat.
- And not on the rocks?
When we get back, I'm gonna get you a new shirt.
This one's nice, but I hate it.
This shirt has stains on it that hold fond memories for me.
You know, you don't have to make a joke about everything.
- Just about most things.
- I'll have you in tow soon.
- Don't you ever shave?
- Just my legs.
- You know all the time when we were insulting each other?
- Yeah?
Every once in a while I'd wonder what it would be like to be you know, close to you.
- Did you?
- Oh.
We can We can be honest with each other now.
Yes, I did.
Sure.
And there you were wasting time with all those other women.
Well, waste not, want not.
I guess we have a problem, don't we?
- We do?
- What are we gonna tell Donald?
Tell Donald?
What-What "What are we gonna tell Donald"?
- About what?
- About us.
About what happened.
Uh, well what do you usually tell him?
What do I usually tell him?
- No, I mean - Yes?
-  - Did you just hear something?
- What do you mean, what do I usually tell him?
- Margaret, somebody's out there.
- What do you mean by that crack?
- Quiet.
Get under that bush.
- I'm waiting for an explanation, mister!
Come on, come on.
Get up.
- Oh, hi.
- Would you be Captain Pierce and Major Houlihan?
- That's right, yeah.
- We're from the 8063rd.
- Oh!
- You must be pretty glad to see us.
Glad?
Glad?
- Glad?
- Stop laughing!
- Margaret, it's over.
- No, it isn't!
Not by a long shot, buster!
So once the new section of artery is in place you do an end-to-end anastomosis.
We're using a new vascular clamp designed at the 4077 th.
It allows us to stop the bleeding without crushing the artery.
- Scissors.
- Scissors!
Thank you.
It's a lot like a coarctation of the aorta where the narrowed area is removed and you sew the two ends together.
- It's new, but it's safe for the patient.
-  Make sure the wound is well irrigated, nurses or you're liable to have a doctor turn on you viciously.
Be sure to ask for the right instruments, doctors or you're liable to get handed something you didn't expect.
Time is important here.
Whatever he asks for, give it to him immediately whether you think he can handle it or not.
And that does it.
Doctor, would you close for me?
- Major Houlihan, can I see you outside?
- Certainly.
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- Not a thing, Captain.
- What's eating you?
- I'll tell you what's eating me.
You're driving me crazy.
We got along a lot better until we started to get along so well.
Now all of a sudden, you're the queen and I'm the "Mirror, mirror on the wall".
- Is that so?
- If I had to tell you you were beautiful one more time I was gonna put it on a record.
- Are you trying to say I'm vain?
- Who, me?
- And demanding, I suppose?
- Look, I don't mind but all this genuflecting is making my pants baggy.
Let me tell you something, buster.
Sir Walter Raleigh you ain't.
You think you're not demanding?
You think it isn't vain to expect me to laugh at every stupid thing that comes into your head?
And the sloppiness, the crudity!
And stop trying to improve me.
- Just leave me the way I am.
- Gladly.
Just a second.
I'm not finished.
Let's keep this out of the operating room.
When we walk into surgery, I expect us to cut into the patients, not each other.
I'm a professional, Captain.
When we get back to the 4077 th no one will see the faintest sign from me we've had even the mildest disagreement.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Shall we go back in for questions now?
- Certainly.
Here's to our dear friends Hawkeye and Margaret who, thank God, are still with us, body and spirit intact.
- Amen.
- I'll see your amen and raise you two hallelujahs.
A "Hallelujah Chorus" of hallelujahs.
They ought to be back in a couple hours.
I don't mind telling you.
I was scared clear down to my jodhpurs.
We all were, Colonel.
I don't imagine they had too terrific a time of it themselves.
Those two?
Probably at each other's throats the whole time.
Oh, I don't know.
Sometimes in adversity the coldest of enemies can close ranks together joining hands, as it were, sustaining each other.
- Maybe he's got a point there.
- I never looked at it quite that way.
You think they, uh, joined hands?
They may have even sustained each other.
Not to mention closing ranks.
What do you think, Father?
I think I'm in over my head.
The 8063rd!
- What's the trouble?
- A house fell on me.
-  You're kidding.
-  Hello, Colonel!
Here we are, Margaret.
Sit right there.
- Oh!
- Let's get it all set up for you.
We welcome back our wandering children with open arms.
And so they don't get lost again, we have a couple of little gifts for them.
- Klinger.
- A MASH compass.
If from this camp you ever stray this little compass will point the way.
Aim this arrow to where you ain't and you'll come home with no complaint.
In case you go traveling again here are your passports.
"This is a chief surgeon and a head nurse.
"Do not give them candy or let them loose.
"Please return to MASH 4077 where they will be given hot soup clean jammies and a kiss on the head".
- Ah!
-  Welcome home.
Welcome home.
And our undying thanks to the bad little boys who disobeyed orders and went out and found 'em B.J. Hunnicutt and Doug Aylesworth.
# Oh, we went lookin' for ya because we both adore ya # # But don't you ever do it Don't you put us through it # # Don't you ever do it again ## - Yea!
-  Thank you.
Thank you all.
You're warm and affectionate and lovely.
And you're so nice to come home to.
Isn't that right, Major?
Yes.
Indeed it is, Captain.
I can't tell you how glad I am you found us.
I can't tell you how glad I am you found us.
-  - Oh, boy!
Am I glad you found us.
- Uh-huh.
- You really saved my life.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
Hell hath no fury like a woman sustained.
- You got any idea what that was all about?
- I think so, yeah.
How'd you like to save my life again?
- Sure.
You want me to fight her for you?
- I need some advice.
We were scared and lonely, and we turned to each other.
Only I turned away first, and I guess I've insulted her.
And I don't know what to do about it.
- Talk to her.
- Yeah, well, I've thought of that.
Only I'm afraid, if we make up, it's liable to start all over again.
- Are you afraid of her or of you?
- Why should I be afraid of me?
Sounds like maybe you felt something for her, and it scares you.
I felt something for her?
Are you nuts?
I felt something?
- You know who you sound like?
- Romeo Montague?
Hot Lips Houlihan.
You got her denial routine down pat.
Don't be crazy.
Well, actually even while I was screaming and yelling at her a while ago a part of me was remembering the night before.
So talk to her.
What's the worst that can happen that you'll have to admit she stirred something in you?
Give a little.
You got plenty to spare.
-  - Yes?
Don't call the police.
I just wanna talk.
- Hurry up.
Don't let anyone see you.
- Nobody saw.
You can't hang around my door like this.
You want people to talk?
Margaret, I came to level with you.
I don't think anything could ever come of it because we're so different but something happened to us out there, both of us.
Maybe we cared for each other a little bit more than either of us would like.
I don't see why we can't own up to that.
We might even turn out to be friends.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Nothing happened out there, not a thing.
Nothing happened?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Not unless you took advantage of me while I was drunk.
For a minute, I was afraid I might like you too much, but I don't think I have to worry.
No, wait.
Just a second.
Here.
Sit down.
Yeah?
I think we can be friends.
- Okay.
- I would agree to that.
Fine.
Well, I'll have my lawyer draw up a contract.
I'm sorry.
I'm not a very open person sometimes.
Nothing will be different, not between you and me or you and Donald.
I don't expect things to be the same with Donald.
You're not leaving him?
All he did was accidentally send you a letter he wrote to somebody named Darleen.
I'm sure the one he meant for you was just as nice.
I'm sending him a letter back a very carefully worded letter.
"Dear Hank".
Do you like "Hank"?
Or maybe I should make it "Dirk".
- Or "Lance".
- "Hank" is nice.
"Hank" will make him crazy.
"Dear Hank "I'll never forget that night we spent in that abandoned hut.
"You gave me your warmth and your caring when I was afraid.
"And now I think, from time to time, when I'm afraid again "I may have the courage to let another person know it.
"You've helped me to grow a little.
Thank you, Hank".
Thank you, Darleen.
The Swedish MASH at Chorwon just heard about our arterial transplants.
- I don't wanna hear the rest.
- You guessed it.
They want a demonstration.
I think Pierce and Houlihan have done their duty.
That leaves one of you two.
Colonel, I refuse to run the risk of going through what the two of them went through.
They were bombed, wounded, hounded by the enemy.
They came back here bloody and limping.
Outside of one moment of glory in the operating tent the whole trip was for them one gargantuan disaster.
-  What are you smiling at?
- I'm not smiling.
- What are you smiling at?
- Who's smiling?
I'm not smiling.
- What are you smiling at?
- This isn't smiling.
I'm serious.
- All right.
Let's cut out the smiling.
- Who's smiling?
All right, all right.
I'll go.
I'll do it.
But when I come back, there better not be any smiling.
- Who's smiling?
- Who's smiling?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
This needs more heat.
Put it in the sun.
- You want it fermented, not melted.
- Don't argue with me.
- I majored in this.
- Top fifth of your class?
Sir?
Captain Hunnicutt - Radar, not so loud.
You wanna bruise it?
- I'm sorry.
- Shh.
- Hold on to your livers.
I'm going in for a taste.
-  - How can you sirs do that to yourselves?
- Everybody's gotta have a hobby, Radar.
- Ours is committing suicide.
What do you got?
Hopefully, one air conditioner.
Oh, no, it's a telegram from your wife.
You know, Mrs. Hunnicutt?
- Telegram?
- Yeah.
- Just phoned it in.
- It's in Korean.
No, that's my handwriting.
"Dorman ready to sell us our acre in Stinson Beach.
Stop.
Need $200 by the 15th for down payment.
Stop.
Love, Peg.
Stop".
Radar, stop.
- Yahoo!
- Sir, people are looking!
- I can't believe it!
- Good news?
Peg and I have wanted this property ever since we were married.
It's got trees, the beach, a view of San Francisco, everything!
Sounds all right if you're willing to settle for everything.
The 15th?
Hawk, today's the 15th!
I gotta have this money today, and I don't have it.
Well, don't look at me.
I just spent my last five bucks on a subscription toFrolicking Nudists.
Saved 50 cents off the newsstand price.
- Radar, could you - Sixteen dollars and 27 cents.
- But it's all yours.
- Well, that's a start.
You can get a tree with a view.
Damn!
Now somebody else will buy that land and put up a shopping center.
##  Uh, speaking of that somebody - Good morning, Charles.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Corporal.
- Warm today, isn't it, Charles?
- I wouldn't know.
- Charles, B.J. Needs $200.
Lend him some, will ya?
- Very subtle, Hawk.
- $200?
That's a lot of money.
- Not for you, sir.
- Of course not for me.
I was referring to Pierce's depleted friend.
Charles, I need it to make a down payment on some property that's very important to me.
I don't know.
It would mean parting with most of my ready cash.
I like to stay liquid.
- Hence, the rubber sheets.
- Slip back into your coma, Pierce.
It's a matter of life or death.
Look, tomorrow's payday.
You'll have it back in your hand just as soon as I get paid.
Well, you obviously can't leave town.
Charles, I'll be indebted to you for the rest of my life.
It'll take him that long to pay you back.
- Radar - Don't hug me.
Get this money to Peg.
- I'm halfway there already.
- I'm depending on you.
Oh, sir?
Congratulations, and many more of 'em.
- Go, go, go, go!
- All right!
Fine.
- This calls for a toast.
- Of that?
Mother Pierce's Liquid Land Mine.
- You sip it.
- You sip it through a fuse.
Thank you, no.
I make it a point never to consume anything that's been aged in a radiator.
He knows what he's missing.
- To God's little acre.
- And his gardener.
Attention!
Attention!
Incoming wounded.
First medical team report to the chopper pad.
Well, celebrate fast around here.
-  Ready for the next one, Klinger.
- Captain Pierce got the last guy.
Please, take the rest of the siege off.
Okay, if anyone wants me, I'll be in my tent marinating the old bunions.
-  Bon "appe-feet".
- Corny.
Corny.
Take it away, Klinger.
The leg goes in traction.
Ladies first.
Roy!
- See you for dinner, Beej?
- Our little spot.
Hunnicutt, could I trouble you for a consultation?
On my way.
This small bowel look perforated to you?
I can't see it.
Retract the liver.
Both my hands are tied up at the moment.
Could you do it?
As long as I'm in the neighborhood.
Fresh gloves.
Retractor.
So, you're moving up to real estate, eh?
Stinson Beach is not real estate.
It's heaven with a view.
Dad owned some property like that once.
Out on the Cape.
Hyannisport.
Gee, we loved to go there.
Then this large family moved in next door.
Nouveau riche.
Played a perpetual game of touch football on their lawn.
Naturally, we moved out.
They'll let those nouveaus live anywhere.
Wipe.
I've got some photos of my property, if you're interested.
Of course I'm not interested.
You know, you were extremely fortunate that I was around with that money.
- Thanks again.
- Oh, don't-don't mention it.
It did work out well for you though.
Peachy.
No perforations here.
- Good.
Do me a small favor?
- If it's small enough.
- Just kidding, Charles.
What is it?
- Uh, close the patient for me.
- Well, it's your patient.
- Just this once.
I'm due in post-op in half an hour.
I'd really like to grab a little bite first.
That's not the usual procedure, Charles.
Just this once?
It's been a long day what with casualties, business transactions.
Right.
Go grab your bite.
Thank you.
I think I should've stolen the money.
And here, where this rock is, will be the living room.
- Or maybe the garage.
- I hope you make up your mind before you lay down carpeting.
Good morning, Charles.
Good morning, B.J. - No, I do not want to look at your land.
- You're jealous.
Olive drab with envy.
- Ahh.
- What time's pay?
At 11:00 or 1100 hours.
I can never keep that straight.
Good.
We have time to enjoy breakfast and still recover from it.
Which one of these shirts goes best with my pants?
- Uh, the green one.
- You're right.
It matches my skin.
Hurry up, okay?
Yeah.
Hunnicutt, before you leave, I sure could go for a cup of coffee.
So go.
Pot's on the stove.
See, I'd like to, but I have this bad back.
Would you be a good egg and pour me a cup?
Winchester, is this some kind of game?
Game?
"Close for me".
"Get me a cup of coffee".
I have the feeling I've become your $200 houseboy.
Well, I'm certainly surprised at your attitude.
If you feel that way about it, I'll get it.
It's just a simple little thing, for heaven's sake.
Ooh!
Please, leave.
- Anything else?
- No.
Take it black.
See you at 11:00.
Are you still in Korea?
I thought you got smart and went home.
Can you believe the nerve of that guy?
Wait.
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.
"Oh, Hunnicutt, since I lent you that money would you be a good sport and simonize my head"?
- Don't give him any ideas.
- You're a schnook.
Thanks.
That's nice.
You're the kind of guy who lets that kind of guy get to you.
So you massage the clown's ego for 24 hours.
What do you care?
You're still the one with the Golden Gate in your backyard.
You're right.
You know, sometimes it takes a simple mind like yours - to work things out.
- I'm glad I could be of help.
- Hunnicutt, do get the door.
- Of course.
Thank you.
Donald has a brilliant system.
I send him my pay, and he sends me an allowance of $30 a week.
- It's a swell system.
- He says by the time the war is over we'll have saved enough to buy our off-post dream house.
- When we got ours, it came with a mother-in-law.
- Ah.
Fortunately for me, World War I started the next day.
Sang Mu is waiting behind Rosie's.
- Hot dog!
- Who's Sang Mu?
Korea's answer to Marshall Field's.
Six floors of merchandise jammed into one ricksha.
Part of my pay's going to a spiffy blanket for my little mare.
- I think she's using you.
- Wait'll you see the string of pearls Sang Mu set aside for me.
- Klinger, when are you gonna give up this inane masquerade?
- Ask him.
Sir, permission to whisper in your ear?
- What's the problem?
-  What do you mean, there's not enough pay?
That Never mind that.
Just spit it out, son.
Okay.
Headquarters in Tokyo fouled up and sent part of our pay to a bakery unit in Guam.
It's gonna take at least a week to straighten it all out.
-  - At ease, at ease.
Shut 'em up.
All right, Radar, take whatever money came pool it, and pay off the enlisted men until the well runs dry.
-  - Colonel, what about the officers?
- S.O.P., Major.
- To hell with regulations!
Ooh, Major.
Don't yell at my bird.
I'm sorry, sir.
It's just that Donald will be so disappointed.
Forget about Donald.
What am I gonna do about Winchester?
Simple.
Ask for a second mortgage.
Sweetheart, I'm only asking for a week's advance.
It's not as if it were my fault, darling.
Listen, Donald, I send you every paycheck.
You can shoot some back for once.
Then cash in one of our lousy savings bonds!
- It's been five minutes, Major.
- How would you like me to stuff this up your nose?
No, thank you, ma'am.
But we do sort of need our telephone.
- You'll get it when I get off!
Now, get out!
- Right.
I cannot believe you are gonna be this cheap.
What?
A guy can't even have his own office.
What?
I hope your colonel's well.
I think it's about time we made some changes in our little system.
Send the money!
Donald, don't you dare hang up on me!
You just sit there and listen to this!
Love's a wonderful thing, son.
Oh, Colonel.
- Donald and I were merely - Say no more, Major.
Why don't you hold back a few dollars from your pay?
- Uh, from now on, I will.
- You're learning.
I appreciate the advice, sir.
- Advice is cheap.
- So is Colonel Donald.
- How dare you!
- Well, you said it first.
Excuse me.
Twerp!
That fella's married to a live grenade.
He's lucky.
He's in Tokyo, out of range.
- You want to send a telegram to Mrs. Potter?
- Radar, I want to send - Must be important.
- It's kind of important.
- Shoot, sir.
- She's gotta send me 50 bucks or I'll lose Sophie's new blanket.
- I could lend you the money, sir.
- Oh, nice gesture, son.
- But it wouldn't be right.
- Why not?
- 'Cause you I'd have to pay back.
- Better believe it.
I mean, uh, you're right again, sir.
Colonel.
## Looks like you're gonna be my only business this whole week, sir.
- What'll you have?
- A little peace and quiet.
-  - Hey, what'd you do that for?
That was "Manana".
Frankly, Sergeant, that aboriginal noise that you call music makes me want to upchuck.
- Don't you have any Rachmaninoff?
- Nah.
- We don't get any vodka here, sir.
-  - Let's find another Officers Club.
- Come on.
- Is he still bothering you?
- Yes, he is.
- That's childish and chicken.
- Is not.
- Is too.
- Is not.
Is too.
Childish and chicken.
Come here.
It's a little quiet in here.
- Let's have some music.
- ##  -  - Mind if we join you, stranger?
It's a semi-free country.
Charles, congratulations on that splenectomy this morning.
That was really great work.
- Well, thank you, Pierce.
- It's 120 degrees.
Why aren't you sweating?
In the first place, I don't sweat.
I perspire.
And in the second place, I don't perspire.
Beers for everybody, Zale.
- You payin'?
- Yeah, just put it on my tab.
- In that case, the bar's closed.
- The bar is what?
Captain, you've already run up a tab of - Can you believe this guy?
- After all you owe him.
You better not come down with anything I can cure.
No cash, no firewater.
- I'm starting not to like Korea.
- Just a moment, Pierce.
Let me handle this, please.
Here you are, Zelmo.
That should clear his ledger.
Charles, sometimes you can be a real prince.
- Said the pauper.
- Three beers, Zale.
- Just two.
- Stick around.
- We'll talk about all the old times we're gonna have.
- Perhaps manana.
- You'll be sorry.
- Don't be crazy.
- Winchester, thanks again.
- Oh, don't-don't mention it.
Uh, Pierce, I could use that beer a little later.
- Anytime.
- Good.
I'll be off duty around 10:00.
Be a good chap, bring it to me in the Swamp, all right?
I have the uneasy feeling I've just been had.
Perhaps that's because you've just been had.
He actually ordered me to get him a beer.
- You actually said, "Anytime".
- The nerve of that guy!
- You're being childish and chicken.
- I am not.
- Are too.
- Am not!
Are too.
Childish and chicken.
- The nerve of that guy!
- Sit down, will ya?
- You're scuffing the dirt.
- Who does he think he is, the Merchant of Korea?
Stop crying.
It's only a pound of flesh.
- A pound of flesh, my butt.
- Wherever.
What do you suppose the sentence is for firing an officer out of a Howitzer?
## Very pretty.
Spike Jones?
Hardly.
It's the drinking song from the first act of La Traviata.
- Here.
Sing this.
- Ah.
Thank you, P A bit warm.
- Bring up the Howitzer.
- Relax, will ya?
Take it easy.
- Let's play cards.
- I don't wanna play cards.
Of course you do.
A little game at the Officers Club.
Just the usual crowd you, me, Charles Charles?
Charles!
Perfect.
Charles.
- How about a little poker?
- Oh, thank you, no.
It's not really my game.
Now, if you had a cribbage board Sorry, there's only one in the whole country, and they're using that at the peace talks.
If the stakes bother you, we could play penny ante.
What's the point of playing at all?
- How about dollar ante?
- Well, all right.
But I must warn you, I'm a very lucky person.
Oh, we all are.
That's why we're in Korea.
- Let's round everybody up.
- Before you can say, "A pair of deuces".
- That was a stroke of genius.
- True.
Now how do we stake ourselves?
- We beg.
- Bad knees.
You take the high road.
I'll take the low road.
And I'll be in the chips before you.
- Halt!
Who goes there?
- Ask me nice.
- Captain Pierce?
- Probably.
How would you like to make a lot of money?
Of course.
What kind of a psycho do you think I am?
Hunnicutt and I are getting up a poker game.
- We've invited Winchester to be the rube of honor.
- Ooh!
I'm in!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Before you hit the casino - can you make a donation to the underprivileged?
- You?
- Me.
- Hey, you can have the blouse off my back.
Just the money.
I really should stay here.
My sermon still needs a big finish.
We've got a rookie in the lineup tonight.
Charles Emerson Winchester.
- Is he any good?
- What do you think?
I'll ad-lib the ending.
-  Oh, Major?
- I'm not here.
Oh, I love what you've done with this room.
Did you make a special trip over here just to harass me?
Well, that and to ask for your hand in a poker game.
Poker game?
Look around you.
I can't even afford the buck and a half to have my laundry done.
- Do what I do wear the same thing every day.
- Yuck.
Margaret, take the advice of an old and trusted lech.
Hunt up some money from your nurses and join in the fun.
We're turning Winchester into "Losechester".
Charles?
He doesn't play poker.
- Not after tonight.
- Oh!
That's unfair.
It's practically robbery.
With a little money, you could have all this folded professionally.
- When do we start?
- We ante up in the Officers Club in 10 minutes.
- Colonel - I heard.
I heard.
I'll see you at the table.
- Radar.
- Buzz off.
- Radar!
- Buzz off.
I'm sleeping.
Colonel!
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I don't know who I'm buzzing off when I'm asleep.
Quite all right.
Son, I wanna take you up on that loan.
- Now?
- A hot poker game waits for no man.
Ooh!
How hot is it, sir?
- Major Winchester's sitting in.
- Major Winchester?
Is it okay if I save some so I can get in it?
Radar, around our house we always carve the ham equally.
That's wonderful, sir.
Is it okay if I save some so I can get in it?
Of course.
I should've found a way to tell you that.
'Round and 'round they go.
Here come the cards.
There goes your dough.
Major Houlihan, I'm really surprised to see you sitting in on this game.
Oh, a little poker always relaxes me.
- Hurry up with those cards!
- Okeydokey.
- ##  - Nu?
Oh, my.
Well, I'll, uh, hmm, open for 10.
- I'm in.
- Call.
Replacements, anybody?
Oh, gee.
Well, I'll I'll take four.
Very good, Charles.
You're starting with one of a kind.
- Two.
-  I'll see that and raise 10.
-  Give me one.
- Keep it in your garter, Klinger.
The bullpen's over there.
- Thought you were on guard duty.
- I bribed Nurse Able in takin' over.
I'm gonna miss Sang Mu's pearls.
Oh, well.
Caution to the wind.
- I'll bet two dollars.
-  I'll keep them company and raise you 20.
Call.
Well, no sense in bein' greedy.
We're gonna be here all night.
Call.
Call.
Mm-hmm?
Three kings.
-  - He always wins the first hand.
Until tonight.
I believe that, uh, a straight beats three kings.
- What?
- A four-card draw, and he gets a straight?
It's awfully lucky, wouldn't you say?
More like blessed.
- ##  -  I don't believe this is happening.
First the war.
Now this.
-  Whose idea was this?
- Ask the five card stud.
Look at him.
He doesn't sweat.
I never saw anybody who doesn't sweat.
Sure you have in the Reptile House.
I'm gonna fold while I still have a little left for the orphans.
Oh, here, Father.
Please.
Give them my Give them my best.
Yes.
Well, good night, everyone.
Good night, Mr. Chip.
##  Hmm.
What do you think?
I agree.
I'm in.
- Don't you know anything from the second act?
- # Raise you 20 # - Curtain going down.
- You deal, Charles.
- Haven't you two masochists had enough?
- Yes.
Deal.
- Come on.
Deal the cards.
- Will you deal, please, sir?
Well, I hate to break your losing streak, gentlemen but I'm going out for a little fresh air.
- We'll have some sent in.
Deal.
- Come on!
Deal!
-  - I'll be back.
I'll be back.
I've just been using the same muscles for three hours.
I thought I'd stretch the others.
##  I'd give Radar's last dollar to know how he's doing it.
- You're almost there, sir.
- Maybe he's cheating.
How?
I hid all the aces.
It's not the winning I mind.
It's that damn smugness.
##  - And that insipid whistling.
- Coming out of that insipid face.
He doesn't even stop when he's got a bad hand.
He just keeps whistling louder.
He whistles louder when he's got nothing.
When he's got nothing!
He whistles louder when he's got nothing!
Oh!
- "Rhapsody in Bluff".
- Folks, I think we've got him.
-  - What?
What?
I'm sorry, but those orphans need the money more than you.
After tonight, they'll have enough cash to buy every parent in Korea.
- Winchester is finished.
- We got him by his mezzo-soprano.
I heard this about $60 ago.
- We got a new scouting report.
- Please.
It's useless.
There's nothing you can say to change my mind.
That whistling he does gets louder when he's bluffing.
- Are you sure?
- Would we lie to you?
Let's get to it.
Oh, wait.
I have an extra 20 in my boxing glove.
I'll raise it 10.
You in, Chuckles?
Ten?
I'd love to stay in, but l I'm a little short.
- Do either of you fellows still owe me any money?
- Paid it all back an hour ago.
Ah.
Well, I was decent enough to loan you guys some money.
Say no more, Charles.
Will 20 do?
- And 20 from me.
- Thank you.
You're going to regret your generosity.
Raise you 30.
## -  I can see that.
- I call.
And to think I've always hated opera.
##  Isn't anyone gonna fold?
Just a bunch of masochists.
Major, you're sweating on the cards.
- Oh.
-  Come on.
You called.
- A pair of sixes.
-  Pair of sixes, hey.
Can anyone, or everyone, beat a pair of sixes?
- Jacks over eights.
-  Well, that's good.
Well, looks like you're the joker, Major.
What do you say we call it a rout?
We'll cash in later.
Thank you, Charles.
This will make Donald very happy if I tell him.
All right, Radar, this makes us even.
- You can trust me.
- I know, sir.
- You say "I know," but you keep counting.
- I know, sir.
From the orphans, Major.
Father, thank you.
-  Thanks very much, Winchester.
Lovely evening.
- ##  -  Good morning, Major.
-  Well, it certainly looks as though I've been taken to the proverbial cleaners.
You've been proverbially washed, dried, folded, and put in the dryer.
Oh, Pierce, I've spent more than this on a late night snack at home.
You gotta admire a guy who takes it so well.
I'm a Winchester, Hunnicutt.
A Winchester.
My, my, my.
This place certainly is a mess.
You know, it's the Officers Club.
I think an officer should clean it up.
- Perhaps someone who owes us a favor.
- A Winchester, Hunnicutt.
- A Winchester.
- Are you implying that I should clean up?
Are you forgetting we loaned you money?
Oh, that's right.
You did.
Don't worry about it, Hawk.
He's a swell guy.
He'll do it.
We'll be in the Mess Tent having iced cappuccino.
Uh, would you put out some fresh flowers?
Don't forget the window.
And clean the drapes.
And keep out of the liquor cabinet.
# Manana # # Manana # # Manana is good enough for me # Yeah, I've got the bottle of dirt right here with me.
It's just like I remembered it.
We'll start building the day I get home.
Okay, the second day.
It's ours, Peg.
All ours.
Yeah.
I love you too, sweetheart.
Give Erin a kiss for me.
And the dog.
Till then.
Bye, Peg.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Attention, all weary members of the 4077 th.
Eighth Army Headquarters wishes to commend us for our tireless efforts during the last three days.
However, all requests for overtime are denied.
Remember when we were interns, and there were still only 24 hours in the day?
- I can't even remember yesterday.
- That's because it is yesterday.
It won't be today until I get a night's sleep in between.
-  -  Am I sinking to my knees or are you rising in the air?
Best thing for a tired body.
You oughta try it.
I tried it.
I couldn't pass the bar.
You go to sleep tired, you wake up tired.
This gives you energy.
I got a fifth of energy waiting for me in the Swamp.
If you'll unhook your chin from that pipe, you can lead me there.
- Couple more.
-  What an ordeal.
Seventy-two hours straight.
I'm prayed out.
Absolutely prayed out.
Don't forget, Father.
God was on six days straight.
He was a lot younger then.
Well, sweet dreams.
That old chaplain looked like a young boy just a few days ago.
- What about us?
-  You look like the High Lama of Shangri-La.
You look like an 8-by-10 picture of Dorian Gray.
I'm gonna get my new bar of soap, take a long shower and sleep, sleep, sleep.
- You really know how to live.
- You?
I plan to take a long bubble bath preferably with a nurse who has her own car and doesn't live with her folks.
Sorry, sir, all we have to offer is cold rainwater in a 50-gallon drum.
- Sold.
-  Aww!
Little Boy Blue Blood is starting on his horn again.
- Ah, music to my rear.
- How can he do that to us in our condition?
No respect for the dead.
##  From the fashionable Swamp Room high above midtown Ouijongbu come the sadistic sounds of Doc Winchester and his all-moose orchestra who ask the musical question, "Why us"?
- Cut!
- Take five, pops!
I don't think he can hear us!
I think you're right.
Easily fixed.
Put down that horn.
We have your head surrounded.
Gentlemen, I've just finished an arduous session of work and now it is time to play.
Why don't you play something a little less harmful, like a bazooka?
-  - What do you think?
- Disgusting!
- ##  Remove that sock.
Oh, okay.
We're about to hear Pierce's "Unwashed" Symphony.
- Remove them.
- What, me touch something that filthy?
- I'm a surgeon.
- You are pushing me toward violence.
Go ahead!
Beat me to death!
Just don't play that thing!
I will play "that thing" whenever I feel like it.
That thing may be the only thing that keeps me from going mad in this cultural Death Valley.
Let's hit the showers before we hit him.
Hear!
Hear!
It's about time the two of you bathed.
- Oh!
Do we offend you?
- Constantly.
He finds our offensiveness offensive.
Your odor is taking the curl out of my horn.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
If you're thinking what I'm thinking.
Are you thinking of stinking?
Make you a deal, Winchester.
You knock off the horn, we shower.
- And if I refuse?
- The more you blow, the worse we'll grow.
Haven't you children learned yet that you can't intimidate me?
Oh, yeah?
Wait'll we age a couple of days.
- We'll curl your nose.
- Reek away, gentlemen.
I will play this thing as long as there is music in my soul and breath in my body.
Morning, sirs.
For your dining pleasure, we have London broil, abalone almandine and a taste bud tantalizer potatoes au gratin.
All right, nostrils.
What've you really got?
- Powdered eggs.
- We had powdered eggs yesterday.
- They're leftovers.
- Hit me with the crepes, garcon.
They're lighter today.
I can hold them up with one arm.
These manhole covers aren't bad.
I may go back for seconds, God willing.
Even the coffee's good.
I wonder what they left out of it.
Mmm.
Here's a cozy booth for nine.
- May we join you breakfast clubbers?
- Sure.
Park 'em.
You fellas will be surprised.
The food's rather good today.
- Shows what a little faith can do.
-  Mmm!
Edible.
Did the wind just suddenly shift?
Seems to be coming from the stable.
Don't blame my horse.
I just washed her down this morning.
Funny.
This was good a minute ago.
Excuse my boardinghouse reach.
I guess you boys haven't had a chance to shower yet.
Oh, yeah.
We had the chance.
Syrup?
We didn't shower anyway.
Thanks.
I see.
Any special reason, like it's National Pig Week?
- Nope.
- You know, in one way you outrank me.
But not where it counts.
Answer up.
It's a dirtiness strike.
When our bunkie gives up his new horn, we'll give up our old dirt.
- That's disgusting!
- That's the idea.
Excuse me, Colonel.
I've lost my appetite.
I'm going to the garbage dump for a breath of fresh air.
Oh, you'll love it.
The bluebottle flies are gorgeous this time of year.
## Hear that?
And that's from the balcony.
How'd you like to live in the front row?
Just make sure the three of you work this out fast.
By tomorrow his nose will be running for cover.
No offense intended, but I'd be happy to burn some incense around you.
Thanks, Father.
Just a prayer for peace and quiet.
Attention.
Attention, all personnel.
Incoming wounded.
All surgical teams to O.R. On the double.
- So much for breakfast.
- Not again.
Yes, again!
Nothing like a good day's work to top off a good night's work.
Let's go.
Hold it!
You two stay behind me.
- What are you doing tonight?
- Writing home.
Suppose I gave you something to write about?
- You wouldn't like the way it ends.
- Give me a chance.
I'm fun, ruggedly handsome and have my own typewriter.
You're a bit aromatic, sir.
Oh, yeah.
I'm a hopeless aromatic.
No.
I mean, you really stink, sir.
- In a few days you'll get used to it.
- I'm not that flexible.
Look, I tell you what.
Don't bathe for three days.
Let your bacteria have a ball.
Then we'll cancel each other out.
Well, I'm canceling you out right now.
There she goes with her nose in the air.
Snob.
-  Wish I could've done more here.
- Nothing more you could do.
It's kind of primitive, but it'll hold him till the boys in Tokyo can rebuild his cheek.
He'll need a lot more than physical attention.
That kind of wound goes a lot deeper than the skin.
- What's worse, the enemy didn't do it.
He did.
- Not self-inflicted?
No, his rifle backfired.
The bolt caught him in the face.
- Oh, how unfortunate.
- Yeah.
Klinger!
- Sir!
- Post-op, and handle him carefully.
- Yes, sir.
Donahue!
- No, never mind.
I'd like to do it.
Gee, you're a nice guy, Father.
Well, I'm a priest.
We specialize in nice.
Ready to close, 3.0 silk.
And a clamp for my nose, please.
The odor is overwhelming thanks to my two rancid colleagues, who shall remain nameless.
- Could he mean us, Dr. Nameless?
- I believe he does, my rancid colleague.
With your permission, Colonel, I'd like to drop a little hint.
Captains Pierce and Hunnicutt, take a shower, you dirty stinkers!
- I take umbrage at that.
- I used to take umbrage, but it gave me morning sickness.
Listen, you swamp rats.
Enough is enough.
Bathe, will ya?
- Hear!
Hear!
- Finally, a mandate from the people.
Look who's talking!
None of this would have happened if it weren't for your sawed-off tuba.
- It's a French horn.
- Blow it out your Champs-Elysees, Pierre!
- That's telling him, Margaret.
- You shut up!
Look, Winchester, there's a nice canyon about a mile up the road.
You can blow that horn till you're blue in the face.
- The enemy would shoot at me.
- I think we're getting through to him.
Good news, everybody!
No more wounded.
- Thank heaven.
- And the manager thereof.
How 'bout this, then?
You and I go out on Main Street, stand back to back - take 10 paces, turn and talk dirty.
- No.
Sorry, fella, but you're normal.
You've just won a 60-day tour of the front.
- Well, how do you feel, Saunders?
- How would you feel?
You've been giving your nurse a bad time.
You've gotta let her change the dressing.
I was doing her a favor.
I don't want her looking at me.
I don't want anyone looking at me.
You're alive, son.
You'll be going home soon.
Home.
I don't wanna go home.
Everybody just be staring at me, or worse, lookin' away.
No one's gonna do that.
They all will, especially Linda.
- Your wife?
- My girl.
I've been looking at her all day.
Pretty.
She's beautiful.
We were gonna get married, but one look at this face and forget it.
Your Linda must have more to her than that.
She's never gonna buy this.
I don't blame her.
Her looks are very important to her.
We were voted the handsomest couple at Allerdice High School.
Now what are we?
Beauty and the beast?
There you go again, jumpin' to conclusions.
Give those plastic surgeons a chance.
My face is busted up.
No matter what they do, it's gonna be patchwork.
You won't accept this, but you've been very lucky.
- Lucky?
- You heard me.
Lot of handsome kids are going outta here without arms and legs.
Yeah, right, Doc.
Guess I'm just about the luckiest guy in the whole world.
##  - How are your earplugs working?
- Great.
I can't hear a thing.
- Shall we?
- Ready when you are, B.O. You just keep playing, Charles.
This won't take a second.
- Contact!
- Bomb bay doors open, and Bombs away!
- His eyes are watering!
- But not enough!
Try to offend a little harder.
We did it!
We brought his lips to his knees.
We have met the enemy and we are his.
Whew!
Glad to see you boys are working this out.
Major, will you shut your mouthpiece?
Why didn't we think of that?
I thought I told you kids to change your diapers.
- Not till he stops tooting.
- Well?
Never!
- However, there is an alternative.
- Goody.
Put me in different quarters.
Fine.
There's an empty bunk with the enlisted men.
Enlisted men?
That's totally unacceptable.
Rather wear a gas mask.
- Good!
Wear it.
Just don't play it.
- Malodorous trolls.
Look, I'm in no mood for the Hatfields and the McCoys.
I came here to drown my sorrows and cauterize my liver.
- Got some vintage stuff.
- How vintage?
- It's fermented longer than we have.
- That old?
All right.
Let's have it.
But don't get too close to me.
My serve.
-  - Hmm.
- That'll rip the tar paper off the roof.
- It hits the spot.
- And rubs it out.
- Tough day at the office, Colonel?
- I don't even want to talk about it.
- Give us a clue.
Sir, come quick!
Saunders swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills!
There's your clue.
- Pulse is weak, but it's there.
- His respirations are really suppressed.
Stay with it, guys.
- Where'd he get the barbiturates?
- Drug cabinet, sir.
- That cabinet is supposed to be locked at all times.
- He smashed the glass.
- Where the hell were you?
- I went into the supply room for just a second.
Why didn't you send someone?
Damn it!
From now on, this man is not to be left alone.
- Yes, sir.
- Pass the word.
- How's he doing?
- He's gonna make it.
This time.
That wasn't very smart, son.
You should have let me die.
At 22?
Mm-mmm.
Too many years ahead of you.
I don't even get the satisfaction of being a hero.
Dumb accident.
My own gun blows up in my face.
Hail the conquering fool.
A man isn't a fool just because he's the victim of an accident but he is one if he lets it ruin his whole life.
If there's one thing I don't need right now it's Norman Vincent Peale.
So save the "everything's gonna be all right" speech for the next guy.
You're very stubborn, aren't you?
Well, so am I. Now, remember, I want a 24-hour watch on him.
Capisce?
Yes, sir.
How quaint.
Sidewalk cafe in the mud.
Very French.
Complete with snails.
Sorry, sirs.
You can't come in.
Did the health department finally get wise to this place?
The entire company signed a petition.
You gotta eat outside.
Come on, Klinger.
We're not that bad.
You are to this bazoo.
Accurate as a Swiss watch.
- And big as the Swiss Alps.
- Flattery still gets you a table outside.
Have a seat.
I'll bring your food.
Whew!
- Where would you like to sit?
- This side.
I love to watch the buzzards swooping down on the garbage dump.
Ah.
Eating outside, I see.
- Mm-hmm.
- Very chic.
Reminds me of the Via Veneto in Rome.
I dined alfresco when we went there for an audience with the pope.
- The pope?
- Numero uno.
Pull up a crate and tell us about it, Father.
- No, I'm expected inside.
- Father.
- Is it because we smell bad?
- Well, uh I, uh Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
How should I put this?
Yes, because of that.
- Jesus ate with the lepers.
- He was an exceptionally good sport.
Whew.
Here you are.
- Sweets for the sweet.
- Uh, busboy, can we have some water?
Only if you bathe in it.
Beej, would you mind trading seats with me?
Can't resist the buzzards?
- No, I just want to be upwind of you.
- Of me?
Isn't it one of life's peculiarities how some people can be sensitive to the aroma of others and yet totally oblivious to the noxious fumes emanating from themselves?
What are you trying to say, Charles?
Just that some people have a certain kind of body chemistry that makes them, uh, well, more pungent than others.
Speaking of body chemistry, you're dangerously close to blowing yourself up.
I didn't want to hurt your feelings, but  You reek, fella.
My eyes aren't watering 'cause I'm homesick, buddy.
Oh, really?
Let me tell you something, buster.
- ## - There he goes again.
We can't even have a good argument in peace.
All right!
That does it.
The irresistible force is about to polish off the immovable object.
-  -      This is getting ridiculous.
Suffering sheep-dip.
Time for a permanent intermission.
Oh, my God.
Saunders!
Now what's going on?
We only turned our backs on him for a second, and he was gone.
I told you to keep an eye on him!
All right, let's split up.
- That's enough, Saunders!
- Get away!
Leave me alone!
- Put it down.
We're gonna talk.
- No more talk!
- Just let me die!
- You're not gonna die on my time.
-  -  It won't stop me.
I'll find another way.
I want to end this.
Don't you understand?
Just leave me alone!
All right.
You want to do it?
Let's really do it.
You'll need some help.
You've screwed up everything else.
You might as well get this right.
Put the mask over your face.
Go ahead.
I won't stop you.
Do it.
Do it!
Go on!
Do it!
Here, let me help you.
You want death?
We got plenty around here.
Suck it in, punk!
Come on!
- What's the matter with you?
- Come on!
- You're crazy!
You're trying to kill me!
- Of course.
That's what you want.
You want to die, and I'm here to help you!
Get away!
If you come near me, I'll belt you!
That's more like it.
Now you're fighting to stay alive, aren't you?
The part of you that wants to stick around is stronger than the part that wants to end it.
Okay.
Hang on to that.
Come on, son.
Let's get some rest, son.
I'm too old for this kind of crap.
I think I tore my shorts.
- Ready, Klinger?
- Ready.
Get set!
- Hit it!
-   Bravo!
Bravo!
Cease watering!
Second wave!
Fire!
Bravo!
I love it!
Drown the cretins.
Sponge detail!
Hey!
Watch I don't care what you do to me, but those lice you killed were women and children.
-  -  How well do we know each other?
-  - There They're dry.
- Here, where are you taking that?
- Where it belongs.
- Hold it, Margaret!
Margaret!
-  Third wave!
Oh, Margaret, no.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Margaret, no!
- No!
-  You barbarians.
You Visigoths!
Do you realize you have taken the last vestige of western civilization left here and you have run it under your pagan wheels?
-  -  Bravo.
Encore!
Encore!
- The horn I never really -  I fear the moment of retribution is at hand.
Yours, I believe.
All right.
Who's responsible for all this?
I see.
Beginning at 2200 hours, you are all hereby confined to the Officers Club for the duration of the whiskey.
Pierce, Hunnicutt and Winchester are buying.
Great idea.
Colonel Forget it, Charles.
If we pay, you pay.
Colonel, what about my horn?
Oh, by all means, Winchester, bring it along.
We'd love to hear it.
- What day is it?
- Tuesday.
- We oughta celebrate.
A whole week of silence.
- And fresh air.
-  - Come in!
Ah, good!
Sang Mu!
How'd it turn out?
- How'd what turn out?
- You aren't through with me yet, gentlemen.
- Sang Mu has rebuilt my horn.
- And I just took a shower!
- Very hard to get parts.
- I'm sure you did your best.
Had to get parts from different horns, but I fit very nicely, okay?
Okay.
I'm gonna have my eardrums pierced.
- There's There's no mouthpiece.
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, "yeah"?
-
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
-  Suction.
- Suction.
- How's the pressure?
- You're okay, Colonel.
130 over 80.
Ready to close, 3.0 silk.
Get this man draped so I can get on with it.
This'd go a lot easier if I had a magic wand.
In lieu of your surgical shortcomings?
Oh, he got you that time, Mandrake.
How can my head ever compete with his?
Mine's all covered with hair.
- He got you that time, baldy.
- Would you boys use those scalpels on your patients?
More suction.
Damn, Margaret!
It's bleeding again.
Can't you hold that clamp any tighter?
Cursing is not necessary.
I'm doing the best I can.
It's this damn instrument!
I know.
I know.
Just stay in there.
If you can't stop that bleeding, this transplant won't work.
We might as well write off the leg.
- I'm ready when you need me.
- Thanks, Father.
What I really need is a clamp that's small enough to control an artery without crushing it.
- Well, don't we have one?
- No.
This clamp is mainly for heart surgery.
It's just not designed for the smaller arteries of the leg.
- It's holding for now.
- Attagirl, Margaret.
- Why don't we get the right one?
- It's not that easy, Padre.
The right one doesn't exist.
Sponge.
Some of the work we're doing on these kids hasn't even hit the textbooks yet.
Chalk it up to the insanity of war, Father.
Enemy advances bring medical advances.
If this war goes on long enough, we'll find a cure for everything.
- If there's anybody left to be cured.
- Progress.
The Korean conflict.
Dedicated to better health through suffering.
Doctor, this won't work.
I need both hands to hold this clamp.
All right, Father.
I can use your hands now.
Work suction.
- Right, Hawkeye.
-  Take that.
- Thank you.
- Progress.
Two hours on that kid's leg, and I don't think I did a damn bit of good.
He'll probably lose it when he gets to Tokyo.
Tricky operation with the wrong instrument.
Don't punish yourself, Hawkeye.
How come the army can make a gun that'll level a village 30 miles away but they can't come up with a tiny surgical tool that'll help save a man's leg?
Give 'em some time.
Could be no one's ever thought to ask.
- So let's ask.
- Ask?
Why not beg?
- Where do we go?
- Well, official channels could take forever.
I remember when I applied for permission to get married.
By the time the papers came through, my son was divorced.
- Strike official channels.
- The guys who can come through are the Corps of Engineers.
We just tell 'em what we want they'll deliver.
They don't have to deliver.
We'll pick it up.
Tell me, Colonel.
How are these bridge builders going to forge such a delicate instrument Bulldozer?
Winchester, those guys could build a sailboat from a pair of skivvies.
Well, what do we do?
Call?
Write?
Send up smoke signals?
What?
You finish sprucing up.
I'll get 'em on the horn.
- Hey, we're inventors.
- More like dreamers.
- There's always one skeptic.
- Charles, have a little faith.
Where would we be today if Alexander Graham Bell hadn't invented the busy signal?
If Joseph Cotten hadn't invented the cotton gin?
You can go on in your usual sub-humorous way, gentlemen but no army engineer has the expertise to produce anything more than a glorified potato peeler.
You know, you have to admit.
He makes a lot of sense.
All the more reason to try.
All the more reason to try.
- Freeze!
- What is it?
- It's gone!
- What's gone?
My wedding ring, you idiot!
It just disappeared!
I went to put it on, and I couldn't because it was gone!
- Margaret, calm down.
We'll help you look for it.
- Where'd you put it last?
On the shelf above my clothes.
I always wrap it in tissue paper and put it there before I scrub.
Oh, Donald's still paying for that ring.
My God, the woman's raving.
All you're gonna find in there is old sweat.
He'll kill me!
It was exquisite!
Fourteen-karat gold with tiny stones all around it every other three a diamond chip!
He must've searched five-and-dimes the world over to find that ring.
There was an inscription from Donald inside "Over hill, over dale, our love will never fail".
When it comes to poetry, Donald's right up there with the pros.
- I've got to get it back!
- Hey, is this how you guys keep your room?
Klinger, have you seen my wedding band?
It was in the nurses' changing room, wrapped with tissue paper.
- White tissue paper?
- Yes.
Sitting on a shelf next to a coffee cup?
Yes, yes, that's it!
You found it!
Thank God!
Oh, bless you, Klinger.
I, uh I sort of threw it away.
Threw it away!
Margaret, we'll go through the garbage.
We'll find it.
That'll be kind of tough.
The garbage truck just left.
Stop explaining and go catch the garbageman!
Not a chance.
He's gotta be miles from here.
- Klinger!
- I'll get a jeep.
Margaret.
Margaret.
He'll find it, believe me.
- That put her mind at ease.
- You have to know how to talk to her.
You're an engineer.
For you it's like making a big tie clip.
Oh, come on, fella.
You gotta be kidding.
- What?
- He says he's never done anything like this before.
If you can't land on it or drive over it, he doesn't want to try it.
- Give me the phone.
- Uh-oh.
Now you've done it.
Young man, this is Colonel Sherman Potter.
My bird wants to talk to your bird.
Patch me through to Colonel De Roo on the double.
He's adorable when he's gruff.
Colonel De Roo?
Colonel Potter, MASH 4077.
No, no.
Our latrines are plenty deep.
I called to ask you boys a special favor.
We need to modify a hunk of surgical equipment.
We can design it, but we can't make it.
You can?
Oh, that's swell.
Ninety days?
That stinks.
Ninety days?
Charles operates faster than that.
You're sure you can't spare one man right now?
"Wunderbar".
Nice talking to you, and I'll try to remember you're on our side.
For the next 90 days, he's got his whole outfit building a dam on the river at Sepyong.
Darn dam!
Why don't they draft a brigade of beavers?
Well, Colonel, now somebody's asked.
How are you boys at "do it yourself"?
Well, here we are in the fender and body shop.
Step one: Take a break.
Wait, wait.
It can't be that hard.
Let's take it apart first.
And then that way, it'll be, you know, apart.
I'll handle this.
Give me a screwdriver.
Mr. Screwdriver coming up.
I'm working on a clamp, not an ocean liner.
I'll have to look in the children's department.
Anything smaller, I have to call the downtown store.
It amazes me that a man that can perform miracles in surgery can be so mechanically inept.
When I'm loosening a screw, do I go this way or that way?
I'll call Larry, Moe and Curly.
Ah, here it comes.
There.
You're a genius.
Now what do we do?
Well, straighten one of these out and go from there.
How do you straighten one of these out?
Well, let's see.
It's made of surgical steel.
Designed to precise specifications.
An alloy of delicately balanced components.
- Hit it with a hammer.
- Of course.
Gentlemen.
What are you doing here?
Well, the colonel said the two of you were gonna try and build the clamp yourselves.
I said to myself, "Charles, this you have got to see".
- Sadist.
- I want you to pretend I'm not here, gentlemen.
Just go about your business, and I will blend into the woodwork.
- What's in the bag?
- My lunch.
I want to eat along.
Hit it with the hammer, will ya?
- Will you stop laughing!
- Please, I'm not here.
You can hit it harder.
The landlady won't mind.
- Will you let me do it my way?
- We're gonna be here forever!
- Please, let me have it.
- Fine.
Here.
Thank you.
You know, if you were half a nice guy you'd be helping us instead of turning it into a picnic.
Oh, get off it, Pierce.
The two of you are fumbling around like a couple of Sunday plumbers.
None of us has the expertise to make the instrument we need.
At least I have the sense to admit it.
- That's for being right.
- Thanks.
- Meet you later under the showers?
- No soap.
- Prude.
- Another nurse down the drain.
Hey, I hear you guys are lookin' to get some new kind of surgical gizmo built.
- It's a clamp, Zale, and yes, we are.
- Know somebody that could do it?
- Sure.
Sure.
Me.
- You know somebody else?
Look, I am a master craftsman.
Nobody appreciates that 'cause I'm stuck in Supply.
Yeah, there's very little demand for supply.
- You know that jukebox at the Officers Club?
- Both songs.
Who do you think puts it back together after the marines visit?
Zale, this is a little more delicate than a jukebox.
Delicate schmelicate.
I can fix or build anything.
With a screwdriver, I'm a regular Leonard da Vinci.
All right, here's the gizmo.
Basically, we need a clamp with a new kind of a handle.
More sensitive.
And jaws that won't crush the artery.
- Right, right.
- Maybe a screw that's sensitive to pressure.
Sure.
Of course.
Hey, I can see it now.
Zale's gift to medicine.
Sleek, compact, streamlined, gorgeous.
Just make it work, Leonard.
- Klinger!
- Why didn't I keep on driving?
- Well?
- You know, Major you have a very natural beauty.
Why hide it with a lot of jewelry?
Look, I went through every garbage bin in Korea.
I even dove into a pile of burning rubbish 'cause I saw something shiny.
It was only a lousy gold watch.
Please, get a rifle.
Shoot me.
Put me out of your misery.
Oh, no.
You're not gonna get off that easy.
From now on, I'm gonna make your life so rotten, you'll wish you were in combat!
Major, I'm tired, I'm dirty and I burned my nose.
On top of that, I'm due on K.P. In five minutes and I won't have a chance to shower!
How are you gonna make my life any more rottener?
I'll work on it!
No, no.
That's your move.
- Are you sure?
- Definitely.
- But he can take my knight.
- No, he can't.
Your knight's protected by your queen.
- You know, I've heard about those two, but I never believed it.
- Make your move.
All right, MacArthur.
Let's see you return from this.
Checkmate, bunkmate.
- Brilliant move you gave me!
- Never touched your knight.
I'd be happy to give you a handicap, Pierce but you've already got one Hunnicutt.
-  - Gather around and strike up the band.
- Zale has done it again.
- You finished?
- Not five minutes ago.
- Well, come on.
Let's see it.
I haven't been this excited since I played Superman in the phone booth with Betty Dinkle.
Ta-da!
Zale, for the first time, you've done it again.
Feels good.
The handle looks like the right length.
I hope you don't mind.
I carved my initials on it.
Z.Z. Zelmo Zale.
May I take a look at that nutcracker?
Ah, the acid test.
The "jack-acid" test.
Here you are, Charles.
Thank you.
What's not to love, huh, Doc?
Well, the jaws should be tighter when it's closed.
It'll never hold like this.
- Sorry, Zelmo.
- Give me that.
Never hold, huh?
Look at that.
Is it coming off?
Is it coming off?
Zale, it won't come off.
Oh, easily fixed.
We'll just loosen that screw.
- You're tightening it!
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Having some trouble?
No!
Zale, will you hurry?
My eyes are leaving their sockets.
- Give me a second.
- Let me try.
- Be careful.
You'll break it.
- It was built broken.
I am now officially in extreme pain.
You don't believe me?
- Just a minute.
I built it.
I'll fix it.
- All right.
- The stupid thing is jammed!
- This would've gone over great during the Inquisition.
Oh!
Now look what you done!
What I done?
You're some master craftsman!
Zale, go back to your drawing board and blow it up.
I give it my best, and this is the thanks I get?
I was gonna make you another one, but just for that crack, I won't!
- Thank you.
- I should get a medal: The Purple Hand.
Gentlemen, far be it from me to rub salt in an open wound but, uh, I told you so.
That's right.
You build us that clamp and whatever we've got is yours.
Come on, Hawk.
What have we got an engineer could want?
- Nurses?
- Hey, no way.
- Not a chance.
Uh-uh.
- Sure.
You got 'em.
Are you nuts?
I don't even know you!
Will you be quiet?
I'm negotiating.
Yeah, Saturday night.
A unit party, yeah.
How many?
Well, we can either get you four brunettes or two dirty blondes and a redhead.
Great.
No problem.
And the potato salad's on me.
Thanks again.
Oh, what I did.
Oh, I've never seen her like this.
She's gonna keep it up until we drop.
Yeah, Hot Lips Houlihan: Blonde land mine.
I wish she'd take my wedding ring.
- It'd be worth a divorce to have her off our backs.
-  - Enter the mausoleum.
- Hello, "goils".
Hello.
- What do you want?
- Love and respect.
- But we'll settle for love.
- We came to ask you a little favor.
Save it.
Hot Lips has us booked through Christmas.
When you hear what we have to say, you're gonna jump right into our arms.
- Fill 'em in, Beej.
- Me?
You do the filling.
It was your idea.
Here it comes.
Behind every great inventor is his nurse.
- What's the favor?
- You have the rare opportunity of participating in an historic medical moment.
- The favor, Hawkeye?
- The engineers will redesign this clamp if you'll go to their unit party Saturday night.
- Oh, no way.
- No.
Sorry.
Out.
- I was wrong.
They love the idea.
- Forget it, Hawkeye.
- You'll be the guests of honor.
- It's not our honor they want.
We've heard about their unit parties.
Those guys are animals.
Go for a couple of hours, slap a few faces, then run for your lives.
It's for a good cause.
Not even if it meant peace on earth.
When I give you nurses a job to do, I want it done right.
What are you two doing in here?
- Is this where they're holding the Ginsburg bar mitzvah?
- Oh, stuff it.
I just spot-checked your inventory.
You're off by 10 thermometers.
God knows what else you missed.
I want you to go back over there and recount everything.
- Oh, Major, that'll take hours.
- At least.
Move it.
Now!
- Well?
-  Behind every great inventor Get out, get out, get out.
Let's give the engineers another call.
Maybe they'll settle for some nudist magazines.
- I'll even throw in my magnifying glass.
- No sacrifice too big for you.
Gentlemen, you're in luck.
Just two days left in summer clearance sale.
We're saving our money for your back-to-school sale.
Okay, go.
If you can't spot quality, who needs you?
Now that's a salesman.
Maybe we could find a pacifier for Margaret.
Okay, my friend.
What do ya got for a couple of big spenders?
- The more you spend, the more I got.
- Oh, yeah?
You wouldn't happen to have a gold ring with tiny stones all around it?
You wouldn't like what I got.
Every three stones a diamond chip.
Every three stones a diamond chip?
- You got one of those?
- I got nine of those.
- I don't believe it.
- That's it!
Guy in Tokyo make them by the dozen.
Easy job.
Cheap setting.
Miracle glue.
- Sounds like Penobscott's style.
- Let me get you better.
- No, no.
Wait.
- No, that's fine.
Can you put an inscription in it?
Sure.
You want your name on this?
- No.
It's for a friend.
- "Over hill, over dale, our love will never fail".
- P-U!
- Yes, it is lovely.
- When can we have it and how much?
- Three days, 25 bucks.
- And don't try to talk me down.
- You?
We wouldn't dare.
Perhaps you like to look at something good now?
Custom made by Mr. Shin, yours truly.
I'm afraid we've used up our allowance.
Do we have to go through that again?
Look, everything a G.I. Could want.
Earrings for that someone special.
Ah, silver snuff box.
Beautiful.
You say you made all that stuff yourself?
Since before you were born, sonny boy.
Could you make something like this?
Yeah.
Take two or three days.
- Charge you 10 bucks.
- Only 10?
Anyone who buy this crummy ring deserve a break.
#Tote that barge Lift that bale # You lose a little ring.
#And you land in jail ## Ah, Klinger, what pipes.
There he is Corporal "Suds" Klinger.
On his fourth record-breaking day of scouring the same pot.
Welcome to Major Houlihan's Doghouse.
Klinger, how'd you like to see the sun again?
- What?
And be denied all this?
- Look familiar?
- You found it!
- No, you found it.
- Huh?
- We bought it, and we want you to give it to Margaret.
Oh, sirs, may your camel spit nothing but dates.
Go!
And don't lose it!
Are you kidding?
I won't let it out of my sight.
Get it quick, before it dissolves!
Get it quick, before it dissolves!
-  - Oh, God!
Who is it?
-  A Lebanese bearing gifts.
- Do you have a death wish?
- No, Major.
- I'm getting my whip.
Hold on a minute.
Take a look at what I got.
My ring!
That's my ring!
- Now can I come in?
- I can't believe it!
- How did you find it?
- It wasn't easy, Major.
On the few rest breaks I had, I re-combed every inch of trail.
Then this morning, on my hands and knees, too tired to go on I looked up and there it was, in the garbage dump perched majestically on a pile of mildewed weenies that sun gleaming off of that brilliant 14-karat gold.
Oh, Klinger, Klinger, you're a doll!
How can I ever thank you?
- You can let me try that nail polish.
- Of course.
I'm so sorry.
When I lost this ring, l Wait a minute.
What's this?
- Huh?
- This inscription.
"Over hill, over dale, our love will ever fail"?
Right.
That is very romantic.
Wrong!
That is very wrong!
It should be "never" fail!
- What happened to the "N"?
- The what?
The "N"!
As in "nut," "nincompoop," "knucklehead".
- Still rhymes.
- Klinger, how could you?
- Major, we were only trying to help.
- "We"?
Hawkeye and B.J. Bought it and gave it to me to give to you.
I should've known those two weasels would be in on this.
- Hey, that's not fair.
- You go tell your accomplices their charade didn't work.
- Major, you're wrong.
- What?
Nobody was trying to make a fool out of you.
We just wanted you to have your ring back.
That's all.
You don't have to be grateful but would it hurt to at least appreciate the effort?
Attention.
Incoming wounded.
One ambulance entering the compound.
Fortunately, that is all.
- You taking him?
- Yeah.
As soon as I get the bleeding stopped.
Wait a second.
Hold it.
Okay, put him to sleep.
- Colonel Potter's scrubbing up.
-  Cotter, get me some more pressure bandages.
Superficial.
He can wait in dry dock.
- What've we got, Father?
- This is Private Cohen from my hometown.
Cohen?
You two go to the seminary together?
- Can you save my leg, Doc?
- I'll do everything I can, Cohen.
I promise you.
Start four units of whole blood and prep him.
- How bad is he?
- Bad enough.
The question is how good's our new clamp?
Suction.
I'll debride the wound.
Then we'll try out that clamp on the artery.
- Right, Doctor.
- Got my fingers crossed, Doc.
-  Count my toes in.
- Count my blessings in.
I'm wearing my lucky bunion pads.
Why don't we all just take out our little rabbits' feet and give them one big rub?
How would you like to be bent into a horseshoe?
Sponge, right there.
Here we go, Cohen.
Okay, Margaret, the you-know-what.
Father, do you have a prayer for an untried vascular clamp?
No, but like you, I can invent one.
Okay so far.
No leakage.
We're still a long way from Tipperary, wherever that is.
- Scissors.
- Scissors.
You know, Klinger found my ring.
I told you to have faith.
You didn't believe me.
But I knew it would show up.
You see?
- It's not the original.
- Oh, really?
No, it's a cheap copy, and I like it a lot better.
- Thank you.
- Anytime.
- Forceps.
- Forceps.
- What gave us away?
- "Over hill, over dale.
Our love will ever fail".
The "N" is missing.
Oh, well, don't worry.
We'll find it.
We found the ring, didn't we?
- You gotta have faith, right, Father?
- That's what He tells me.
- How's the clamp working, son?
- Like a lioness holding her cub.
Nice!
Best 10 bucks we ever spent.
- Congratulations, boys.
- That Mr. Shin deserves a medal.
He could always make himself one.
Ladies and gentlemen, we may have something here.
Primitive but functional.
You know, Pierce, this might just make a surgeon out of you.
Wait till you see my next invention.
I'm gonna make a silk purse out of you.
Cohen?
Cohen?
Now, what was he in for?
- Lube and oil.
- No, that was DeSoto.
Here we are.
Cohen.
"Check the battery and empty the ashtrays".
- Yeah, that's me.
- How does the leg feel?
Well, there's some tingling, and I can wiggle my toes.
- That means I can keep it, right, Doc?
- Of course.
It's yours.
I don't know what you guys did, but I want your names and addresses.
I'm gonna send you both Hanukkah gifts every Christmas for the rest of your lives.
My color is anything but green.
We'll take most of the credit, but not all of it.
In your case, we had a little help.
- Meet "a little help".
- What is it?
Clamp.
Vascular clamp.
You're the very first person we ever tried it out on.
- No kidding?
- Something to tell your grandchildren about - while you're bouncing them on that knee.
- How about that?
Well, just another example of good old American know-how.
- You haven't read Mr. Shin's inscription.
- His inscription?
"Over hill, over dale, Korean clamp will never fail".
That's where he put the "N".
Hey, Mr. Shin!
Ah, you're just the guys I want to see.
Congratulations.
Your clamp is a real life and limb saver.
That was nothing.
I open whole new line of Mr. Shin's surgical supplies.
Look here.
Pearl handle scalpel.
You look like million bucks with this in your hand.
- I already have a scalpel.
- Can also be used as spoon.
- Can opener.
- No, thank you.
- Cuticle remover.
-  That's cute.
- Corkscrew.
-  Corkscrew!
- That we can use.
- Sold.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Cunningham.
Wow.
All those head wounds.
Looks like they got scalped.
Who's their C.O., General Custer?
- They're English.
- That would be the Gloucester Regiment.
-  How do you know?
- Those are the nutcakes that never wear helmets.
They're trying to prove it's mind over shrapnel.
- Whole blood and prep him.
Stat.
- And this one's next.
- Hey, Doc.
Remember me?
- Hi.
Yeah, sure.
I sat next to you at the Dempsey-Firpo fight.
Nah.
You operated on me about eight months ago.
You're in luck.
The warranty's still good.
It's really hurtin' me, Doc.
Can you give me somethin'?
- Sure.
Ten milligrams of morphine.
- Is that enough?
We just wanna ease the pain, soldier, not put you into orbit.
- I'm hurt bad, ain't I, Doc?
- Shh.
- Ain't I, Doc?
- Please.
You're distracting me.
- Am I gonna be all right?
- I'd rather not commit myself at this time.
Please.
Do your best.
Oh, soldier, you don't know how fortunate you are.
- Major Winchester was one of the finest surgeons in Boston.
- Thank you, Major.
In the States, you couldn't even afford to have this man look at you.
She's absolutely right, you know.
If this had happened in Boston, I would have referred you to someone else.
What hands.
If I were on the operating table I wouldn't want anyone but you to touch me.
Set a place for me, will you?
How revolting!
I have every reason to revolt.
I'm sick of this place.
Winchester, is that still your first patient?
I've done three since you started.
He's probably running a check on the guy's credit.
Do you want it good, Colonel, or do you want it fast?
Good and fast.
This isn't Boston General.
We're a MASH unit.
We do a volume business.
Well, I'm sorry.
I was not trained on an assembly line.
Neither was I. Nurse, wrench.
Don't be too hard on Charles.
This is Wednesday.
He gave up his squash game to be here.
Thank you, Captain.
I'm sure you'll do very well after the war in a nice little free clinic somewhere.
- Goodness.
What a sharp tongue.
- He's sliced a lot of baloney with it.
-  Will you get off his back!
- Bottle it, all of you.
Colonel, I've gotta talk to you.
What is that smell?
Klinger, did you fall into the sauerkraut?
I'm wearing Asian Musk.
It "creeps out of the night to weave its magic spell".
- So does a skunk.
- You don't like it.
Now, stop sulking and speak up.
I got a patella here that looks like a tennis racket.
Somebody broke into Supply and cleaned us all out of penicillin.
Oh, damn!
Black marketeers again.
Thought I told you to change the locks on the Supply room.
I did, and it stopped 'em cold.
They had to break down the door.
Well, take a jeep.
Make the rounds.
Try and get us some more.
It's times like these I could use a travel ensemble.
-  Suction.
Suction, suction!
Now!
- Can I do anything, Hawkeye?
No, not yet, Father.
He's still got a chance.
I'm sorry, Father.
That was a dumb thing to say.
No, no.
No, I understand.
I know I must seem like a vulture to you, waiting for the unfortunate ones.
- I wish I could be of more help.
- I wish I could too, Father.
- Look at this guy.
He's full of tea.
- Tea?
- Yeah.
You can't tell whether he's a soldier or a samovar.
- I don't quite follow.
They gave him tea when he was wounded.
Now it's seeping into the abdominal cavity an engraved invitation to peritonitis.
Oh, my goodness.
Why would they do that?
I don't know.
I'll never understand some of these English units.
They think a belly wound is an occasion for high tea.
This guy took cream and sugar yet.
As if his wounds weren't enough.
What can you expect from a country that has socialized medicine?
Only Shakespeare, crumpets, Vivien Leigh.
- Let's not forget penicillin.
- How can we?
We don't have any.
It's 102 plus.
That damn tea.
It's peritonitis.
Without penicillin, he's gonna blow the top off that thermometer by morning.
I suppose you'll have to get a new thermometer.
What's the matter, Pierce?
Sorry you didn't think of it first?
Oh, it's a joke.
You're wasting your time here.
You belong in the Catskills.
Hey, how about a shot, Doc?
This pain is somethin' awful.
Really?
It shouldn't be that bad.
Take it from me it is.
Okay.
It's a little early, but I'll see that you get another shot.
- You're a real pal, Doc.
- Roberts.
Ten milligrams of morphine here.
Ah, here you are, lads.
All looking quite chipper, I must say.
-  - Hello, Major.
We'll have you chaps back on duty in no time.
The doctor says it'll be a couple of weeks for me, sir.
Nonsense.
There are plenty of lads up on the line that are worse off than you.
What do you think this is, a holiday at Brighton?
-  'Alf a mo', guv.
- Hmm?
-  Who are you?
- Major Derek Ross, Gloucester Regiment.
You wouldn't be the, uh, the chap that told this man he could lollygag around here for a fortnight?
Yeah, that's my prescription plenty of rest and 100 c.c.'s of lollygag.
I don't appreciate your humor, Doctor.
What is your rank?
Either private or general.
I can never keep that stuff straight.
Whatever you are, you obviously plan to keep these men here much longer than necessary.
They all look ready to go right now.
Take another look, Major.
These men need time to recuperate.
Nonsense.
Look at Michaels here roses on his cheeks.
Take him outta here too soon, he'll have lilies on his chest.
Is this mollycoddling standard procedure?
These men aren't on holiday, you know.
They're fighting a war and they can't do it on their backs.
- You believe this guy?
- Like something out of Gunga Din.
Uh, gentlemen, perhaps it would be best if you let me handle this.
Uh, Major, the fact is that, in our best medical opinion it would simply be unwise to release these men prematurely.
Have you ever had the Beef Wellington at the Dorchester?
Now see here, gentlemen, I'm their commanding officer and I will not have these men lounging about in this luxury resort.
But, Major, they're here on the American plan.
Won't cost you a farthing.
I  I don't mean to be rude but I wish you'd mind your own bloody business!
Well, I do mean to be rude, so I wish you'd get your bloody butt out of here.
You'll be sorry for that.
We've an old saying in America "Get out".
Very well, but I'll be back gentlemen.
-  - Hmm!
I love the English.
Wonderful manners.
It's been six months since my last confession.
You sure this is just between us?
- Nobody else is gonna know.
- Only the one who knows everything.
-  Colonel Potter?
- I'm speaking of the Lord.
Oh.
Well, see, I'm goin' home.
But before I leave, I wanna get something off my chest.
- Go ahead, my son.
- Yeah.
Well, I've done some bad things here, Father drinking, fighting, fraternizing.
Well, there's nothing wrong with fraternizing.
Unless you mean Oh.
Fraternizing.
Well But there's something worse, Father.
I got in with these guys some G.I.s and some Koreans.
- Yes?
- The black market, Father.
Medical supplies penicillin, sulfa and morphine.
- Oh, I see.
- I didn't like doin' it.
But there's a big market for this stuff.
Penicillin is like gold, and the dough was good a grand a month.
Oh, my goodness.
The dough was grand.
Now I have this terrible guilt.
Well, I know of several good charities.
- Perhaps you might leave the money here.
- Too late.
I sent it back to the States, to my wife.
She put a down payment on a house.
Won't it trouble you knowing where the money came from?
Oh, yes, very much.
That's why I'm here.
But, hey, I didn't do the actual stealing.
- They just paid me to stash the stuff.
- Stash it?
Where?
Under the temple bell at the burnt-out village school.
Oh, I see.
Well, if you want His forgiveness, you're going to have to right the wrong.
I'd love to, but I got a plane to catch.
I'll work on it when I get home.
Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?
Let's see.
Drinking, fighting, fraternizing, black market.
No.
That's it.
Yes, go ahead.
Keep sponging him down and continue I. V. - That's all we can do.
- Yes, Doctor.
Great war, isn't it?
Snipers, land mines, artillery.
And now thieves.
It's not the war.
It's the neighborhood.
You're right.
Why don't you move to the suburbs?
Then you can catch the 5:15 to O.R. -  How you doin: Old sport?
-  Not so good.
I got a lot of pain.
Give me a shot, Doc.
- You've had two in the last eight hours.
- I can't help it.
- The pain's awful.
- Shouldn't be that much pain.
All I know is it hurts!
Okay.
You need a shot, you'll get it.
Thanks, Doc.
Really appreciate it.
- Comes and goes, huh?
- Huh?
What do you mean?
You were in agony a minute ago.
Soon as I said you'd get a shot, you're happy as a clam.
Oh.
Just knowing I was getting some relief was What were you here for last time, Johnson?
Hip wound.
Uh, took some shrapnel.
Bone wounds can be painful.
How long were you on morphine?
A week.
Well, maybe two.
That was while you were here.
How long after you left?
-  Aw, come on, Doc.
- You're hooked, Johnson.
You don't need that shot for pain.
You just need it.
You mean you're not gonna give me another shot, Doc?
I'll give you everything but.
I'll take care of you.
I'll hold your hand if necessary, but I won't give you any morphine.
I don't need you to hold my hand, Doc.
I need that shot.
No.
You're not gonna leave here a junkie, pal.
That I promise you.
Oh, Colonel.
Was Klinger able to round up any penicillin?
No.
He struck out at the 8063rd.
Let's hope he'll do better at the 80-double nickel assuming they like the smell of sauerkraut.
Uh, Colonel.
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.
- Fire away.
- Well, l I'm afraid I can't be completely explicit.
- Would you like to give me a hint?
- A hint might give it away.
Is it animal, vegetable or mineral?
Well, it's spiritual mostly.
- That narrows it down.
- Actually, it's something of a dilemma.
Well, what's the dilemma?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
- Can't tell me that.
Uh-huh.
Look, Father, I'm kind of busy.
I'm trying to rustle up some penicillin.
- Oh, exactly!
Exactly.
- "Exactly" what?
- Well, maybe I'd better be more specific.
- Hallelujah.
After all, I have a responsibility to my fellow man.
On the other hand, we have the confidentiality of the confessional - which is absolute.
- Absolutely.
No matter what I do, I fear I'll be in the wrong.
You're right, Father.
This is a dilemma for the both of us.
No.
This is my own problem.
- Something I should work out myself.
- Whatever you say.
Yes.
- Well, thank you very much for the chat, Colonel.
- Not at all.
You'll have to stop by sometime and tell me what we chatted about.
Father, has the Colonel had any luck finding us some penicillin?
- I'm afraid not.
- Lf we don't get some soon you better brush up on your graveside manner.
-  - Oh, dear.
- Klinger, have any luck?
- Nah.
Nothing.
I should've worn something backless.
I think I know where we may be able to find some penicillin.
- Oh, yeah?
Where?
- Well, uh, I can't tell you that.
- Then how we gonna get there?
- Oh, yes.
- Well, l-I better drive.
- Then what do you need me for?
I can't divulge that either.
Okay.
I've been on blind dates before.
-  -   I think I should warn you, Klinger what we're doing could be dangerous.
Father!
We're only doing 30 miles an hour.
No.
I mean, we're dealing with the black market.
There's a possibility we could run into some shady characters.
Hey, I'm from Toledo.
Half my mail comes from death row.
"Shady characters".
- There's the schoolhouse, Klinger.
- Nice location.
Why does everything in Korea look like it was built deserted?
Before we go in, Klinger, I want to thank you for coming along.
If you gotta say that, I'm sorry I came.
There must be a lot of happy Korean kids around here, Father.
- Why?
- The schoolhouse burned down.
I used to dream about that in Toledo!
-  Klinger!
- I never really did anything about it.
I meant, quiet.
You can't tell who might be around.
It's deserted like summer vacation.
Ah!
Look.
Look, there it is.
If we're in luck, there may be drugs under here.
This is the first time I ever broke into a bell.
Come on.
We'll lean it back.
And pray.
I'm with you, Father.
Oh!
It's heavy!
Shh!
We must be very quiet.
-  - Watch it, Klinger!
- Ooh, sorry.
- Now, can you hold it like that?
I'll try.
- I've got something.
- Me too a hernia.
"Penicillin.
4077".
This is our stuff.
- We're stealing our own drugs?
- But this isn't stealing.
It's redemption.
-  -  - My goodness!
Was that a shot?
- Your shady characters just rang our bell.
It means "Class dismissed".
Let's get outta here!
Come on!
What's the matter?
Let's go!
- I'm caught.
- Well, we've got to get out of here.
Rip it!
Are you crazy?
This is my best skirt.
-  - Hurry up, Klinger!
Hurry up!
Come on!
-  - That was an original.
Now they'll make copies, and you'll see it all over Korea.
- Whoo!
Shot, Father!
-  - Get down!
Get down!
- Throw it into fourth, Father!
Onward, Christian soldiers!
How's that feel?
I can't take it anymore, Doc.
Please.
Half a shot?
Hang on, Johnson.
Hang on.
You're winning.
Winning?
You call this winning?
Oh, you doctors are great.
First you get me hooked, and then you say, "No more".
Nobody planned it this way, pal, but right now you got no other choice.
A few more hours, you can own your life again.
No.
It isn't worth it.
Gimme a shot or let me die.
- You're not going to die.
-  He's very inventive, but he's a little a little structure conscious for me.
In my humble opinion, the greatest work in the whole operatic literature is Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen.
I think I saw it with Ethel Merman.
That must have been interesting.
Tell me, Major, how do you cope with the cultural famine around here?
- Well, I have my work.
- Oh, of course.
And I do my nails.
And, of course, there's my yoga.
I love yoga.
- Whoops.
- Oh.
Here.
Ah, careful.
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
My sleeve is caught in your cluster here.
- Well, get it uncaught.
- Well, I will if you'll hold still, Major.
Well, hurry up.
These animals would just love to get a photo like this to send to Donald.
Major, this could hardly be described as a passionate embrace.
- It's not an embrace!
-  - I believe that's what I said.
- Just get Aah!
-  - Here it is, folks!
Penicillin!
Penicillin!
Father, where on earth did you find it?
Well, it was all very exciting.
There's this burnt-out schoolhouse by the village.
- It must have been quite charming in its day - We heisted a bell.
- Klinger!
Where's your skirt?
- Missing in action, ma'am.
Go cover yourself, you hairy fool.
I am covered, Major covered with glory.
All right, nurses.
Come and get it penicillin.
- Start dishing it out pronto.
- One to a customer.
- This round's on the Father and me.
-  How'd you get it?
- Through the greatest act of bravery since Audie Murphy.
- Or Father Duffy.
I'll read the book.
Baker, keep an eye on Johnson.
He should be calm for a while.
Keep him on the I.V. - Call me if there's trouble.
I'm gonna get some sleep.
- Yes, Doctor.
Colonel, if you'll be good enough to sign this bill, sir.
Bill for what?
Twelve dollars!
One skirt a Klinger original a casualty of my death-defying mission, sir.
- I'll get you the material.
The rest is up to you.
- Sold.
Let me tell ya how I got that stuff.
Well, Padre, you certainly saved the day.
Oh, thank you, Colonel.
And there's nothing quite like putting one's spiritual values into action, is there?
Can I assume your little escapade had something to do with what we weren't talking about?
Oh, dear.
I must have divulged too much.
Well, you slugabeds still on holiday?
- Can I help you, sir?
- Good heavens.
What are you?
Just a simple Lebanese psycho.
- And you always look like that?
- Absolutely not!
This is disgraceful.
I usually wear a dress.
What can I do for you, sir?
- I'd like to be alone with my men.
- Of course.
I'll go slip into something more comfortable.
-  - That was probably the commanding officer.
Captain?
Captain Pierce?
- Captain.
Hey!
-  What is it, honey?
- Come on.
You gotta get up.
- Who are you?
Listen, trouble in post-op.
That English officer's back.
He's probably gonna quick-march his guys outta here.
Over my already dead body.
Hand me my pants and take a pair for yourself.
Hey, Beej, Colonel Blimp is back.
- You wanna come for the deflating?
-  How do you like that guy?
He only works Come on, Klinger.
It's Lexington and Concord all over again.
"And now the bloke has taken a real fancy to your sister.
It wouldn't surprise me if he popped the question before long".
I thought the family had given up, Billy.
Oh, where there's a little dowry, there's a way.
Go on.
Read your letter, Billy.
I'm on the edge of me pillow.
"Percy's been out with her three times this week.
"Once for a walk on the heath, again for a toddy at the Bull and Bush and today they went to the Royal Albert Hall".
Takin' a roundabout way to get to his flat, isn't he?
-  - Well, what is it this time, Major?
You gonna put the men through a few calisthenics to see if their sutures hold?
Doctor, would you please spare us your diatribe until we're finished here?
Uh, off you go, Michaels.
Read your letter from home.
- Off you go, Michaels.
- Uh, right, sir.
"The baby's eatin' solid food now.
"I was holding her at the breakfast table, having some sausage.
I turned my back, and the little tyke ate half of Mum's banger".
- What's goin' on?
- Quiet.
I'm confused.
Hey, lads!
Arsenal defeated Manchester United.
Two-nothing.
- They're gonna take the cup.
- You're balmy, mate.
It's Queen's Park Rangers all the way.
- Oh, get away.
- Of course.
They got a lovely chance, they do.
- Get off.
Get away.
- You care to step outside?
If I'm not back in five minutes, call a bobby and a cut man.
Carry on, chaps.
-  - You were saying?
- First of all, who are you?
- I beg your pardon?
Well, you're obviously not the same martinet who came here before.
Whatever do you mean?
Today you're all peaches and cream.
Last time, there were more casualties when you left than when you came in.
Young man, you, uh, you've missed the whole point.
Don't you understand?
When I was here before the men were hoping I'd behave exactly as I did.
Uh, once more, in English.
Only a madman would lash out at a wounded soldier without reason.
So if I come in here breathing fire, they realize they're going to be all right.
You may think it rather callous, but, as you can see, they've responded to it.
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
The, uh, the Marquis de Sade School of Bedside Manner.
Doctor, my men know I wouldn't shout at them unless I expected them to get well.
They believe it because I believe it.
- So your last visit was just an act?
- An act of kindness.
There are times when it's better to slap a hand than hold it.
- The story of my love life.
- Ah, yes.
Small wonder.
You know, you Americans would be well advised to learn a little from British tradition.
After all, the Charge of the Light Brigade was as much a matter of morale as, uh, bravery.
Jolly good, Major, but not all your traditions work out quite so well.
For instance?
For instance, giving your lads tea when they've been hit in the belly.
That leads to another tradition peritonitis.
- You're sure about that?
- Uh-huh.
Quite.
Hmm.
Well, that does make a bit of sense.
I'll take it up to higher authorities, but I don't know.
If it was anything but tea.
Major, we're waiting to hear your letter now.
- Would you care to join us?
Ripping good stuff.
- No, thanks.
I gotta get some sleep.
If I don't get 15 minutes a night, I'm cranky the whole next day.
Doctor, I, uh I appreciate how much you care about my men.
Almost as much as you do.
Well, we each have our different way, don't we?
Well, you go your way, and I'll go mine.
Ah, it tastes good.
Doc, I'm sorry I gave you such a rough time.
It's all right.
The time I gave you was rougher.
- Is orange juice habit-forming?
- I hope so.
-  Hey, thanks again.
- My pleasure.
This one's from my Aunt Eloise.
"Dear Benjamin, Guess what?
"Freddie Simpson sold the pharmacy to a couple from Montpelier "and the chocolate phosphates haven't been the same since.
"I think they put in too much syrup.
"Martha doesn't agree with me, but you know what a sweet tooth she has.
"The upshot is we're no longer speaking.
Grandma Bates says "her varicose veins have been acting up again.
"Old Doc Snyder, who also agrees with me that there's too much syrup in the phosphates "says it's just that her girdle is too tight.
"He may be right.
She's always bought them a size too small.
I don't know how many times I've told her that's why she walks to the left".
Beej!
What are you doing?
I'm a hit.
They love me in there.

This time, I get to play cards and checkers.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not fair.
- Because whoever has the cards and checkers always wins.
-  - Well, that's what l - Don't-Don't look.
Don't look.
- Five bucks says that's Father Mulcahy.
-  - Ten'll get you Radar.
- You're on.
- Come in.
- Afternoon, sirs.
Aah!
Radar, you're the last person I wanted to see!
Radar, old buddy, lookin' at you is like money in the bank.
All the other tents, they just say hello.
- Would you like to join us?
- What are you playin'?
- Double Cranko.
- Yeah.
- Bishops are worth three jacks.
- Right.
- Checkers are wild.
- Uh-huh.
And you have to be Ah.
- Care to sit in for a hand?
- You'll get out by dawn.
Uh, no, thank you, sirs.
Whenever I lose, I always like to know why.
Actually, I just come in to see Major Winchester.
- Now I'm confused.
- I just wanna borrow his record player.
We just got a new shipment of records in from Special Services.
Colonel Potter says I could play 'em over the P.A. If I could find something to play 'em on.
That should be great for breaking up the monotony.
I don't know.
You know, I remember their last batch.
"Andy Devine Sings Cole Porter".
Oh, no.
These are all new.
There's some really swingin'jazz stuff.
Radar, say no more.
Here you are, compliments of Major Winchester.
Uh, sir, I can't take it without his permission.
- He loves for people to borrow his things.
- No, it's not right.
I take full responsibility.
Just don't tell him I gave it to you.
- I don't know about this.
- Go on, quick, before Charles changes his mind.
- Okay.
You guys thank him for me, okay?
- I'll be sure not to do that.
- Gee, it's nice to be nice.
- Ready to start?
- Okay, let's flip the board to see who goes first.
- Call it in the air.
There you are, kid.
We're ready to go on the air from one end of the camp to the other.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Pick up that mike and announce the first tune.
Right.
Uhh - That's it?
- Oh, come on, Klinger.
I don't know what to say.
Well, just put it in your own words.
I don't have any of my own words.
I just use everybody else's.
Come on.
You speak into this thing all the time.
Yeah, but I never jockeyed a disc before.
- I mean, I don't know what those guys say.
- Have no fear, kid.
- I'll tell you what to say.
- What, you know about this stuff?
Are you kidding?
Remember that payola scandal in Toledo two years ago?
My Uncle Bob gets out next month.
Oh, well, then maybe you should be the announcer.
Me talk into this thing?
Not a chance.
Here.
Just say your name, then the song.
It's simple.
Okay.
Hi.
This is Corporal No, this is Radar.
Um, I just thought you might like to hear, uh No, uh, I got a We just got a shipment of, uh Yeah, uh, I'm gonna play a record for you.
- ##  -  - Not so terrific, huh?
- I better write you some stuff.
- What kind of stuff?
- Disc jockey talk.
You know, uh, "Hey, this is your platter pusher, Radar O'Reilly slidin' on some hot sides for all you cats and hot dog ladies".
- Dig it?
- I don't understand a thing you just said.
Good.
Neither will they.
I don't think I was cut out to be talented.
I don't think I was cut out to be talented.
- Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
- What?
- Wait a minute.
Attention.
- ##  Attention, all personnel.
Incoming choppers.
Sounds like plenty.
All medical teams report to triage on the double.
Over here.
Set this man down here.
Chinese are throwing everything they got across the parallel.
The 8055th has bugged out.
The 8063rd is overloaded.
We're getting everybody's casualties.
The whole enchilada.
Fractured skull.
Possible hematoma.
Dilated pupils.
- Prep him stat.
- We're running out of room, sir.
- Make room.
This guy can't wait.
-  Geez.
Where are they coming from?
Everywhere.
The question is where are we gonna put 'em?
Charles, I got a bus full of belly wounds.
- In a moment.
- Now, Charles!
I've got a compound fracture here, and it's bleeding.
- Bones have to wait.
- Well, Colonel, I beg to differ.
That's an order, not an opinion.
- The most opinionated order I've ever heard.
- Klinger!
- Yes, sir.
- Type and cross match for two units whole blood.
- Prep him stat.
- Yes, sir.
Radar!
Oh.
What happened to the music?
I figured with all the casualties and all you'd No, no.
Get back in there and play something soft and mushy.
We're gonna need all the sedatives we can get.
Yes, sir.
I'll get on the slow stuff real fast.
- What'd I tell you?
You're a hit.
- Yeah, I guess so.
-  - More choppers.
As if we weren't busy enough.
Hotel's already full.
What do we do now?
We move the help.
As of now, the Officers Club, the Mess Tent the Swamp, the post-ops two, three and four, in that order.
And we thought this was the off-season.
##   I have a suggestion.
I will loan Radar one of my classical recordings to relieve this pop nightmare.
Nah, you've done enough, Charles.
We're already using your phonograph.
What?
Without my consent?
I want it back right this second!
Relax, Major.
I just made it your contribution to the emergency.
Music is medicine right now.
Just once I would like to offer something before it is taken from me.
- Clamp.
- Clamp.
- Sponge.
- Sponge.
Margaret, will you please hand me these things on the beat.
- You're the one who's off.
- Well, let's get together.
Clamp, two, three, four.
Sponge, two, three, four.
- Hawk, name that tune.
- "Up a Lazy Liver".
- No, no.
It's "Musical Clock".
Tell me what it's from.
- "Mr. Belvedere Goes to Korea"?
No, it's the theme song from The Late, Late Show.
Why are you telling me?
We hardly know each other.
Whenever I heard that at home, it was my turn to go out in the kitchen and heat Erin's formula.
I miss that little kid.
He's hemorrhaging.
Suction, Margaret.
We've got a lacerated aorta.
Pump in two more units of whole blood fast.
Klinger, get two more units of AB negative, now.
AB negative?
You might as well ask for a ticket home.
We only had two units in the bank, and it went in the first wave.
Well, do what you can to get us some more.
- I'm doing.
- Start him on plasma.
Margaret, vaso clamp.
Let's get this bleeding under control.
## Okay, now we do the old double reverse.
Collect all his blood, filter it, and give it back to him in post-op.
Radar, for my next patient, I'd like something in a waltz.
"And now, music lovers, here's some music you might love.
"It's called, uh 'Wish Wish You"' Uh, I can't see it, 'cause the record's spinning.
Well, here it is, whatever it is.
Okay, today's Mess Tent special: Thermometers.
Each and every one contains mercury on the inside with just enough alcohol on the outside to make it interesting.
- ## - Listen to that.
I hate that song.
They were playing it in the pool hall right before I went in for my physical.
I'd just put the three ball in the side pocket.
Four in the corner.
Told Hymie to hold my money, and I'd be back in a half hour with 4-F printed on my chest.
- So what happened?
- I walked in there talking Lebanese.
I had my eyes crossed.
I had measle dots painted on my face.
It went over like a lead salami.
I wonder if Hymie still has my money.
Each and every one contains numbers up to a hundred and six.
- Oh, Nurse?
- Yes, Major?
There's something on this man's chart that l I don't understand.
See, it says here, "Lima beans and cube steak in country gravy".
Am I to administer that or treat it?
Sorry, Doctor.
That's a menu.
This is usually the Mess Tent, you know.
Ah.
Do inform the cook lest he believe this man to be the patient du jour.
## Ah, "May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You".
They're playing your song, Father.
Well, actually, I requested "Tico, Tico".
But this is very nice too.
Yes, it is.
I haven't seen so many people horizontal in this place since New Year's Eve.
At least those people were able to walk in.
Wanna join me at the bar for a shot of cough syrup?
Well, looks like he's having the usual.
Why?
Why do I have to move my foodstuffs into Potter's tent when they're allowed to leave this ridiculous distillery here?
Will you stop griping?
Haven't you heard?
There's a police action on.
That's easy enough for you, Major.
You're not being forced out of your own quarters.
- Charles, you know what this is?
- What?
It's the world's smallest violin, and it's playing just for you.
And I thought you were different.
Charles, did you pack the napkin rings?
- There are some things I just refuse to do without.
- You I expect it from.
Amazing.
Charles leaving in a huff.
He usually goes out in a snit.
Just so long as he goes.
- How's he doin'?
- Not good.
That's the last of his own blood.
Then we're back on plasma.
What about the AB donors?
The road to Seoul is out.
Nobody can find the 8055 and the 8063 is worse off than we are.
"And now a rhythmic room-shaker requested by "Corporal Max 'I Wanna Get Out Of Here' Klinger.
It'll be coming your way as soon as I put a new fang in the old tone-arm cobra".
"Fang in the tone-arm cobra"?
They found an AB negative donor at Tokyo General.
-  Wonderful!
- Not so wonderful.
- He's in for hepatitis.
- Bull's-eye.
Of course.
We got anybody else?
A guy with a bomb disposal unit ten miles from here.
But he's out on "R" and "R".
They're tryin' to find him now.
There's never a bomb disposer around when you need one.
How long do you think he's got?
We better fill him up soon.
Blood all over this camp, and none of it the right type.
## You'll excuse me if I don't dance.
And a big hello, you daddy-o's, mommy-o's and N.C.O. S from Big Daddy O'Reilly.
- Big Daddy, just play the records.
- Got ya covered, big cat.
- What?
- Uh, that means yes, sir.
Real cool.
Here's a mover and a groover, and it ain't by Herbert Hoover.
It's for all you animal and music lovers.
"The Cincinnati Dancin' Pig".
- ##  -  You say it and I'll play it.
Yeah, MASH 4077 th.
Yeah, hold on a second.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Right.
Ooh, he is, huh?
Okay, I'll tell 'em all.
Great.
- ##  - Attention, all personnel, especially Hawkeye.
A Big Daddy bulletin.
"Your AB negative is on the way.
It'll be here sometime after sundown".
- Which is now.
Okay, pig, dance.
- ## Hot diggity!
That's the first good news I've heard in two days.
- Remember you heard it here first, sir.
- You take requests, right?
- I don't have anything from World War I, sir.
- Button it.
You have "Sentimental Journey"?
- Oh, Colonel.
- Do you have it?
- Well, yeah, but - Play it.
Okay, but there's a lot of people ahead of you, mostly wounded.
It may not be till later this evening.
Corporal, let me remind you.
I own this station.
It's coming right up, Boss.
Uh, Colonel.
Owner.
Real cool.
## -  - Come on in, bunkies.
- Oh, talk about plush.
- When I grow up, I wanna be a colonel.
All right, this is my room.
Those are yours.
I don't know.
The desk clerk promised me an ocean view.
- Not even room for complaints.
- Leave an aisle.
- I make a lot of trips during the night.
- Go for me too, will ya?
This thing should come with an instruction manual.
Oh, there's nothing to it.
Stand back.
I'm gonna blow mine up.
It's as easy as one, two Come on, will ya?
There.
Good thing only my top half is sleepy.
- I think mine's alive.
- Hope none of you boys are sleepwalkers.
Well, I used to be.
My mother cured me with psychology.
- Scattered tacks on the floor.
-  Nobody here but us sardines.
Oh, now, really.
This is impossible.
Major, there's a couple of inches for you right here.
I refuse to sleep standing up.
- Why?
We do it in O.R. - I'm sure you do.
I, however, am neither an incompetent nor a horse.
- Well, then, what are you?
- I demand a space for my cot!
Hello, room service?
Send up a larger room.
Come on, you birds.
Let's roost.
- My crib was larger than this tent.
- Of course.
- He had to have room for the tennis court.
-  Oh!
Gee, and there's room for us too.
- A little lumpy, but it'll do.
- Now that that's settled, good night.
- Get your filthy feet off me.
Get them off!
-  - I hope you all have nightmares.
- Will you guys quit horsing around?
-  - And now, for the third time tonight a request from our commanding station manager that moldy oldie, "Sentimental Journey".
- ## -  Again?
Colonel there's gotta be something special about that record for you.
Yeah, there is, but I don't know if I should tell you boys.
Oh, come on, Daddy.
We want a story.
Well, every time I hear that song - it reminds me of a very special young lady.
- Mildred?
- No, after Mildred.
-  Oh-ho!
Happened about a dozen years ago when I was stationed at Fort Dix.
One night, some of the boys and I went up to New York to hear Les Brown and His Band of Renown.
Well, I was sort of just lookin'around when suddenly, walkin' across the dance floor there she was, this willowy blonde beauty.
I was in love.
Well, the band started playing.
The vocalist started singing "Sentimental Journey".
I looked up to see that I had fallen in love with Doris Day.
I'm glad Mildred wasn't there.
I couldn't have handled it.
I have never taken her to a Doris Day movie.
I've seen 'em all alone.
Sometimes I feel bad that Mildred doesn't know.
But then I remember, Doris doesn't know either.
-  Watch out, you idiot!
-  Get out of the way.
You're gonna be sorry you got in the way!
- I bet that's your blood donor.
- Yeah.
I can smell his "R" and "R" from here.
We must be gettin' closer to town.
We're hittin' more people.
A guy can't sleep anywhere!
Try the minefield, Charles.
It's quieter.
- I hate this place!
- Oh, boy.
This guy is a beaut.
I don't know what good Bloody Mary here is gonna do ya.
He's on the rocks.
You'd be surprised.
I've seen successful transfusions with 20% alcohol.
Twenty percent?
That'd give Dracula a lost weekend.
# Gonna drink a sentimental journey # # So show me the way to go home # - This guy's in bomb disposal?
- He's bombed, all right.
We didn't need headlights.
His nose lit us all the way.
Hey, where's my old buddy, Sergeant Grale?
- Zale.
Zale!
- Hey, there ya are.
Hey, you're a cute little bugger, ya little bugger.
Watch it.
You're wilting the face.
Come on, you booze hound.
Well, we're either gonna get blood or vin ordinaire.
Unbottle him, dilute him with black coffee, and pour him into the Swamp.
And don't spill anything.
We need it all.
Well, good luck with this one.
After he saves the kid, I'm gonna hook him up to the still.
-  - Come in.
Take that somewhere else.
I've got no more room.
- Margaret, it's me, Charles.
- What are you doing dragging a cot around the compound?
I'm looking for a place to spend the night.
- Forget it!
- Margaret, there is no other place.
Uh-uh.
N-O.
Margaret, on this occasion, allow me to be frank.
Frank?
I beg your pardon?
No, no.
No, I didn't I meant Frank with a little "F".
I didn't mean that other Frank.
I know what you mean.
Margaret, there are two reasons why you should not be worried.
One, you are a married woman.
Two, I am exhausted.
And three, you won't be here.
Margaret, we are both adults.
Yes, of the opposite sex.
## How you feelin', Sarge?
Good as ever.
I can handle it now.
- Where's the bomb?
- Four cups of coffee and he's even drunker.
- Lie down right here, sir.
- Right here.
- Lie down?
- Yeah.
- What for?
- We're gonna play gas station.
- You're the pump.
- And he's out of gas.
What are you What are you doin'?
Hey.
Hey, that's that's not a bomb.
He's sobering up.
He's able to distinguish objects.
That's a needle!
What are you gonna do?
Take blood out of your arm and put it into his arm.
- See, he needs alcohol, but he can't drink it straight.
- Oh, no!
You're not gonna put no needle in me.
I can't stand it.
I pass out.
It's okay.
You'll be lying down anyway.
You don't understand.
Look, l-I really pass out.
I can't stand those things.
They-They make me feel oogie.
I know how he feels.
I get that way from peanut butter.
- It's okay, Sarge.
Take it easy.
- No!
- It won't hurt.
- Help!
- Help!
- Talk about getting blood from the stoned.
- Sarge!
- Help!
Help!
- ## - Margaret, I tried post-op.
I tried the Mess Tent.
I even tried the compound.
I almost got run over.
- Better luck next time.
- Help!
- Save me!
- Who are you?
- I was here first.
- Hide me, please!
- They're trying to kill me!
- Who's trying to kill you?
They are, with that needle.
- Don't mind him, folks.
He's just a volunteer.
- Well, what have we here?
- You two kids have the whole house to yourselves?
- What are you doing?
- Oh, no!
- Get him out of here!
- No!
- Margaret, will you be quiet?
You're making him nervous.
- Move him!
- Makes a great chaperone.
- Get out!
- Let's get him back to the Swamp before somebody lights a match.
- Let's go, Bourbon Street.
-  Come on, you bum.
- What is going on here?
- We asked you first.
If he snores during the night, make him go back to his own cot.
- How dare you!
- Bless you, my children.
- Get out!
- Don't they make a lovely couple?
Come on.
They want to be alone.
Woo-woo-woo!
- Now you see what I put up with - You and your cot, get out!
- I haven't had any - Get that cot out of here!
Out!
Out!
It's almost dawn.
I want to thank you for the charming evening.
Perhaps there's a nice deserted roof somewhere.
## Mon Capitans, I bring you good news from the corpuscle front.
New donors are on the way, and you'll soon be able to unhook this clean, wholesome youth from this stinking drunk.
- How is the patient, by the way?
- Pulse is 88.
Blood pressure 94 over 60.
I bet you he wakes up singing "Sweet Adeline".
And he wakes up singing "How Dry I Am".
It's beddy-bye time for you, sir.
Unhand me, you varlet.
You know not whom you touch.
Come on, Captain.
The crisis is over, huh?
What do you say?
- Don't ask.
Just take him.
- Take, take.
That's all anybody does.
Does anybody give around here?
All right.
Give me your arm.
Who's there?
Who's there?
- It's okay, Harker.
- Who are you?
I'm a doctor.
A very tired doctor.
- My stomach hurts.
- I know.
We'll give you something for it when you're a little stronger.
- Am I gonna die?
- Of course not.
You're not gonna die either.
##   You know, uh, this is Radar, mike-side talking to you over the mike, and this is the 23rd playing of the old "Sentimental Journey".
You know, I've really enjoyed staying up all night playing this tune.
And now that we've all heard it we'll never forget it, including me 'cause I've played it 23 times.
And you folks have been so kind with your requests and your kind requests that I just wanted to tell you that I'm gonna stay here on this sentimental journey for 12 more hours.
How's that, you hot potatoes out there in MASH-land?
- ##  - You just signed off.
- But, sir, my loyal listeners - Are the ones that asked me to shut you off.
- Oh.
- Don't feel too bad.
You did a good job.
You kept us going at a crucial time.
- I'm proud of you, son.
- Thank you, sir.
And for the first time in 12 years I can honestly say I'm sick and tired of Doris Day.
- What do you mean, I lose?
- Look, I got a full house.
All you've got is a lousy pair of checkers.
Plus the fact that my ten of hearts has your bishop ready to convert.
- Is he following the rules?
- What rules?
Ah.
Now it makes sense.
Sergeant Walter Gribble requests permission to say good-bye, Colonel.
- Permission granted, Sergeant.
- Good-bye, Colonel.
Good-bye, Sergeant.
You know, uh, it's a pleasure to be able to help dismantle that bomb.
- You ever need me again, just call.
- Oh, we will.
- You do fine work.
- Thanks.
You know bomb disposal is not only a highly technical and complex job but a very dangerous one.
- May I?
- Oh, please.
Too much rice.
I could tell you stories that would set your hair on edge.
I'm sure you could.
Colonel, you owe me 17 I'll never forget this one time when this nut put a bomb in his colonel's briefcase.
It was attached to the lock, and I had to cut - right through the briefcase.
- Gee, it's time for rounds.
Had to cut right through so I would not touch the, uh Excuse me.
I have to run.
Colonel, you owe me I think we should go again, all right?
I think you're ready for Triple Cranko.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
-  -   Doctor, do you want me to hold that for you?
Corpsman!
Another case closed, Watson.
Care to join me in my digs on Baker Street?
- For what?
- A little seductive reasoning.
- Sorry, Sherlock.
Can't win 'em all.
- Drat!
Another evening alone with my pipe and dirty robe.
Got that belly wound finished yet, Moriarty?
- All sewn up.
Corpsman.
-  Ah, here's our next couple.
- Welcome to "Who Bet Your Life".
- Will you cut it out?
- There's nothing to joke about here.
- Oh, let him go, Major.
Sometimes a little humor helps break the tension in a war zone.
Lap sponge.
During World War I, we used to dress a mule up in a petticoat and charge the fellas a dime a dance.
Fifteen cents if they wanted to lead.
No!
Put that mask back on him.
He's not under enough.
- I'm trying, Major, but he keeps pushing it away.
- Push back harder!
Don't start a fight, or we'll be sent to the principal's office.
- I can't stop it.
- I'll do it.
I'll do it.
If your doctor has to do your job for you, he'll have to reglove.
- If you can't follow an order, call for help.
- I'm sorry, Major.
Hey, Margaret, take it easy.
She just doesn't like a guy who grabs.
Nobody asked you!
Butt out!
Bell, you're on report.
- For this?
You're kidding.
- No.
Add talking back to a superior officer.
- Margaret, wait a minute.
- Carry on!
Major, why don't you reconsider?
She didn't do anything but ruffle your fetlocks.
Am I within my authority as head nurse if I put her on report?
- Yes, but - Thank you.
As an officer and a gentleman, you should forgive and forget.
If she's forgiving, I'm forgetting.
Major, I, for one, applaud your sense of discipline in the midst of chaos.
- Go stuff it, balloon brain!
- Now, I applaud that.
Oh, Margaret, let me give you a hand.
This may take a minute.
I'm used to doing this in the dark.
- Go away.
- Don't panic.
I'll have you out of there in no time.
I just wish you people would leave me alone!
Oh, yeah?
Like the way you left Nurse Bell alone?
I was doing my job!
You never fall on a nurse that hard for such a nitpicky mistake.
- You're too good for that.
What's eating you?
- Nothing!
Come on.
If you can't tell your number one nemesis, who can you tell?
I can't.
- Can't even imagine that it's true.
- What's true?
- Would you lower your voice?
- Is this low enough?
I'm sorry.
I'm using my larynx as a subway station.
What is it?
Well, I was with Donald - about six weeks ago in Tokyo, and - Yeah?
- Well, I think - What?
I'm pretty sure that I'm pregnant.
- Pregnant?
- Shhh!
- You mean with child?
- Sh-Shhh.
Expecting?
Our little major is gonna have a minor?
That's wonderful!
Sorry.
- There's nothing wonderful about it.
- Are you kidding?
All we see around here is death and destruction.
Now, in the middle of an inferno that even Dante wouldn't buy tickets to there's a little glimmer of life thanks to you.
That's not wonderful.
That's a miracle.
You know Donald and I are having problems.
This isn't gonna solve them.
It's only gonna add to them.
And you know what it means, don't you?
Automatic discharge.
My whole army career, kaput!
- It's all Donald's fault.
- Well, I wouldn't put it all on Donald.
I mean, you were probably there at the time.
- What made you so sure?
- I have all the symptoms - morning sickness, nausea.
- We all have that - from the Mess Tent takeout window.
- There's more.
- I've been irritable lately.
- Well, if you count irritability you've been pregnant since I've known you.
Captain, that time of the month hasn't been that time of the month yet.
- And that was last month.
- Maybe your watch stopped.
Look.
Look.
Have you verified this medically?
- Well, no lab tests - Well, then what are you guessing for?
Why don't we go see Colonel Potter and set up a test?
Come on.
Come on.
- You know, I hate you men.
- Now she tells us.
How's that shoulder feel, Martinson?
I think I did a bang-up job on your bang-up even if I do say so myself.
- You're gonna send me back up there, aren't ya, Doc?
- You're ambulatory now.
You'll be out of here by noon Thursday.
You're lucky.
That's when our rates change.
I don't remember.
Did I remove your sense of humor?
Knock it off, Doc.
This morning I was leading and retreated smack into a minefield.
That shrapnel you removed from my shoulder is what's left of my sergeant's helmet.
He was right next to me when the mine went up.
I am not going back.
I won't go back.
- I know how you must feel.
- You think it's because I'm scared, don't you?
- If you are, you're not alone, soldier.
- I am not a soldier.
I never was a soldier.
I thought R.O.T.C.
Would keep me out of active duty.
Should've read the fine print.
- I thought they'd put me into something I was prepared for.
- Like?
Art history I was an art history major.
I think the marines are the only ones with an art history division.
I'm not kidding!
They are not sending me back into action.
I don't have what it takes to lead men into combat.
That sergeant would still be alive if it hadn't been for me.
- Look, Martinson, you can't blame yourself for that.
- Get out of here, will you?
Just leave me alone.
- Bedside manner failing you, Hunnicutt?
- Lay off, Winchester.
What's this, "Attila the Pun" has lost his sense of good humor?
Drop it, Charles.
- Touchy.
-   I'd like to talk to you about my family.
It's 'Scuse me for saying so.
Your mail is leaking, Colonel.
- Honey.
- Your mail is leaking, honey.
Don't crack wise, Klinger.
The missus knows how hard this stuff is to get over here.
She tried sending me a jar, but those mail jockeys cancel packages with their boots.
You're telling me.
Try to mail order an atomizer of perfume and see what happens.
- You mentioned something about your family.
- Oh!
Oh, yes, sir.
It's been on my mind for years now, and I must get it off my chest.
- What is it this time?
-  I've been hiding it till now.
But these are my children.
I didn't want to burden anyone with my troubles.
- All nine of 'em.
- I've always liked big families.
- How did this happen?
- Well, you're a doctor, sir.
You ought to know.
- I mean, who's the mother?
- Mothers.
- I see.
- I've finally given in to my tortured conscience and decided to take full financial responsibility.
- That'll cost you a fortune.
- Exactly.
It'll mean I'll require a hardship discharge, of course.
- But it's for the kids.
- Of course.
Little Santos here needs new shoes, and Ellen will have to have braces soon.
And, then, there's the twins Achmed and Irene.
This one is swarthy.
The other is blond.
Fraternal twins.
Klinger, none of these kids look like you.
They don't even look like each other.
Well, of course not.
Their mothers raised them to be individuals.
- Who's the tall one?
- Oh, that's Santos.
But you said this was Santos.
Uh.
Well, uh, he is too.
- I ran out of names.
- This kid has got to be at least 19.
That would mean you were a father at 11.
Well, what's so unusual about that?
I had a moustache when I was three.
Klinger, this is the worst one yet.
In the first place, I know half these kids.
This is Erin Hunnicutt; Sergeant Zale's daughter, Zelda and this is my grandson, Corey!
I knew it!
I knew it!
I shouldn't have gone to Radar for these!
Margaret, will you sit down?
I got holes in my shoes just looking at you.
- What's keeping that old coot?
- The old coot's here.
- Oh, Colonel - I know.
It was said with affection.
- Colonel, Margaret may have a little problem.
- Is it you - Winchester or the nurses?
- I'm pregnant.
Pregnant?
Well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah!
I used "wonderful" and "miracle".
- Did you tell Donald yet?
- No.
- Should you?
- Yes!
Then tell him.
I remember when our son was born.
Made me prouder than a stallion out to stud.
Colonel, I don't think you're getting it.
Uh, Margaret and Donald aren't, uh, uh  - They're-They're not, uh - What he's trying not to say, Colonel, is that - Donald and I are not - I think I've got it now.
Not to mention the fact the army would make Margaret trade in her boots for booties.
Isn't there some way around that?
Can't we bend the rule just a little bit?
Only if you stay just a little bit pregnant.
- We'll be sorry to lose you, Margaret.
- Well, wait a minute.
We're not even sure she's pregnant.
How about a lab test?
- Sure.
I'll let her go to Tokyo.
- No.
Can't we do it here?
- I don't want anyone else to know.
- We'd need a rabbit for that.
- Then, get one!
- How about, uh - Radar?
- No.
He'd never go for it.
That rabbit's his pet.
He lives with it.
He reads to it.
- He'd even marry it if it was the same religion.
- If it's a choice between - his rabbit and our head nurse - Then I outrank him!
- Who, the rabbit?
- You sirs call me, sir?
- Have a seat, son.
- A seat, sir?
Yeah, here.
There you go.
- Uh, care for a drink?
- Uh, no, thank you, sir.
- Makes my ears wider.
- Still a growing boy.
- Well, I sure could use one.
- A drink?
Yeah, you bet.
- Son, we need a favor from you.
- Oh, anything, sir.
- I think.
- Radar, you have a female rabbit, don't you?
- You mean Fluffy?
- Yeah, we'd like to, uh borrow her for a while.
- For a pregnancy test.
- Oh, no, sir.
That couldn't be.
See, I keep her and Bongo in separate cages.
If I didn't Well, you know what they say about rabbits.
- It's just talk.
-  - Can-Can we get on with this?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
The pregnancy test is for Captain!
Well, on behalf of Fluffy, he has a right to know.
The test is for Major Houlihan.
- You're gonna be a mother, sir?
- Well, we don't know yet.
- That's why we need the rabbit.
- Oh.
What does Fluffy have to do in this test?
She doesn't have to do anything.
It's very simple.
We inject her with some fluid from Major Houlihan.
Then, about 48 hours later, we check the rabbit's ovaries and if there's any change, then the test is positive and Margaret is a mother-to-be and a major-that-was.
- Well, that doesn't sound so bad.
- Radar, to check the ovaries we have to put them under a magnifying glass.
- Uh-huh.
So?
- We don't put all of her under the glass just the ovaries.
Oh, noo!
Oh, no!
No-no, no-no, no-no!
You're not gonna kill my Fluffy.
You're not gonna use my rabbit as a guinea pig!
Why, l That would be murder!
There you go, Bongo.
I know you'll be lonely without Fluffy.
Don't eat too much.
You'll get too big for your house.
- Wish you hadn't done that.
- Well, I figured I'd rather let her go than to see her killed.
I know how much you love her, but we wouldn't have asked if it wasn't important.
- Yeah, but why do you have to kill her?
- I told you.
- The ovaries have to be examined.
- Can't you just take 'em out and let her stay alive?
- Operate on a rabbit?
- Yeah!
I've never done that before, not even on a chocolate one.
- But it's possible.
- Yeah, theoretically, sure.
But it's all academic now.
Well.
Yeah.
No, it's not.
- Houdini O'Reilly, I caught your act at the Palladium.
- No.
No.
No.
- You promise you'll take good care of her?
- I'll do my best.
Yeah, and-and-and you'll be real gentle with her and talk to her when you're putting her under.
- I'll read to her from Uncle Wiggily.
- Yeah, well - Okay.
I guess that's all right.
- Okay.
Come on.
- Okay.
- She'll still be able to have kids, won't she?
- Radar.
- Y-Yeah, well -  Clamp.
-  Clamp.
- More suction, Margaret.
- I'm trying, but it's so small in there.
Nonsense.
There's nothing to it.
Tweezers.
Tweezers.
Radar, you don't have to wait outside.
- What'd you say, sir?
- I said you can come in!
There are still seats available for season ticket holders.
- Uhh.
No thanks.
-  Oh, come on!
You've seen hundreds of people operated on.
Yeah, but people bad stuff isn't as bad as rabbit bad stuff.
I'll just wait out here.
- Why don't you and Bongo read a magazine in the waiting room?
- Right.
And there we are.
Great.
Can we take a look?
Uh-uh.
We gotta get our patient back on her paws.
Hey, Doc, what's the verdict?
Do I get to live?
Can I go home to Buffalo?
Well, there's no internal damage.
As for your going home I'd say about a week.
And as for your living in Buffalo I'd call that a contradiction in terms, eh?
Why don't they leave me alone?
I - Let me go home.
- Look, Tom.
I hate this place, this war, just as much as you do.
But there really isn't a whole hell of a lot we can do about it except cope with the situation as best we can.
- That or rent a room in Leavenworth.
- No.
I have to get out of here.
Come here.
- There is another way.
- All right.
What is it?
I can recommend you be sent to Tokyo for psychiatric observation.
No.
I'm not letting headhunters get ahold of me and put in my records that I'm nuts.
"This is to certify that Tom Martinson, Associate Professor of Art History - went bonkers in Korea"?
- They're not there to brand you.
They're there to help you.
Oh, don't you lie to me!
I spent four years at Yale.
I took all those courses.
It's bull.
I'll tell you what they'll say.
"Neurotic tendencies, severe paranoia, manic-depressive".
- Will you slow down?
- Hunnicutt, would you mind if I talked to him for a moment?
- It might help.
- Be my guest.
Well, now, don't-don't Don't go away.
I think it's important you observe this.
What class were you in, Lieutenant?
- Yale '48.
- Harvard '43.
Major Charles Emerson Winchester.
I could tell at once Sit down.
I could Go ahead.
I could tell at once that you were a man of education and breeding.
I guess the army is no place for a couple of - Ivy Leaguers like us Is it, Lieutenant?
- No.
Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm.
- No.
It surely isn't.
- The daily grind.
The stupidity.
The riffraff that one is forced to associate with.
- Would you hand me that pack?
- Surely.
If I were in your shoes, Lieutenant, and I am I'd feel exactly the same way that you do, which I do.
I understand completely.
I understand completely.
I'm glad to hear that, Major.
- 'Cause I know you'll understand this.
-  - We're goin' home.
Don't move.
- When I said I understand I didn't mean that I completely understand.
There are things I don't understand at all.
Hunnicutt, do something, please?
- Tom - Stand back.
Stand back.
- I'll shoot this man if I have to.
- Okay.
Not that okay.
- You take me to your C.O. - I should've expected this from a Yale man.
Colonel Potter!
Colonel Potter!
Is that too loud?
- Just get him!
- Colonel Potter, would you mind stepping out here, sir, please?
- This better be good, Winchester.
- Oh, it is, Colonel.
- Colonel Potter, this is Lieutenant Martinson.
- You the C.O.?
- What do you think you're doing, son?
- Getting out of here.
And I'll shoot this man if I don't get what I want.
- Let's just talk about this, nice and easy.
- My boy, I'm Father Mulcahy.
He is.
He really is.
He's wearing pajamas now - but he's a real father.
-  Please, Major!
Son, right now, this may seem like the road to freedom.
But in reality, it's a pathway to self-destruction!
I want a chopper, a transport to the States food and clothing to get me back to Ohio.
- I think you ought to give it to him, Colonel.
- Okay.
You got it.
Let Major Winchester go now, and I'll personally guarantee your safety.
- I got my guarantee right here.
- Ow!
- Now, let's see that chopper!
- We'll have to call one in.
He'll be here at dawn.
-  Radar!
- No good!
I want one now!
- Colonel, don't put him on a waiting list.
- I'd get one for you if I could.
- Colonel, don't put him on a waiting list.
- I'd get one for you if I could.
But choppers can't fly at night.
It's not like they have headlights.
-  You're gonna have to wait till morning, Tom.
- Better be telling the truth.
- Do something.
- You can wait in my office until the chopper gets here.
- No harm'll come to ya.
I promise.
- Just stay back!
-  - It's a trick.
They're trying to confuse me.
- Get back, all of you!
- Get back, get back, get back!
That's an order!
- That's an urgent request to you, sir.
- Now, don't try and follow me.
- Right.
I'll stay here.
- Move it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Come on!
You did a fine job, Captain.
I've never seen such delicate work.
- So small.
- So round, so firm, so fully packed.
- Is it over yet?
- Okay, Daddy.
You can look now.
Ooh!
Aw, Fluffy!
Ooh, you're gonna be okay.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
- No problem, Radar.
Couple of days, she'll be the queen of the hop.
- Can we run the test now, please?
- Yeah.
- Let's put the specimen under the glass.
- I'll get it.
Charles, learn to knock first.
We have a naked bunny in here.
And he has a loaded pistol back here.
- My God!
He does.
- Cripes!
- Quiet!
You're supposed to be on our side, fella.
- Please forgive him.
He's an idiot.
- Get over there.
Rest of you, outside.
Keep your hands up where I can see 'em.
- She doesn't have hands.
She's a rabbit.
- Please do as he says!
- We're going.
We're going.
-  Uh-oh.
Your shoulder's bleeding.
Can I fix that for you?
So I can put the gun down, huh?
No way!
Out!
Or that man's life isn't worth a dime.
- We were just going anyway.
- Come on!
Move it!
Go!
- Oh, okay.
We're moving.
We're moving it.
- Move!
- I just need my specimen.
- Get out!
- Out!
- Get out!
Don't be nervous.
-  Wild look in his eye.
- He's holding my specimen!
- I mean, a gun on Charles.
- Who is that guy?
- Patient of mine.
Wants to go home.
- Via Hostage Airlines?
- That's the ticket.
- Radar, get on the horn to Dispatch.
Tell 'em to get a chopper here by dawn.
Tell 'em to clear a flight to Ohio.
- Did I hear Ohio?
- A patient is holding Major Winchester hostage - until they get to Ohio!
- Why is everybody standing around like a bunch of ducks?
- Somebody go in there and get him!
- Colonel, I volunteer.
- Klinger, come back!
You'll get killed!
- Now, there goes a real man!
Hey, buddy, take me!
I'll go with you.
- Stay back, lady.
- Klinger, you moron.
- Okay.
Take it easy.
Just wanna talk.
- Are you armed?
You kidding?
Where would I put it?
- Did they get the chopper?
- Nah.
Somethin' better.
- Me!
- What?
Take me instead of him.
I got your escape plan.
I got my own plan a chopper to Seoul, a plane back to Ohio.
I'm from Toledo.
I know people there.
I could make it easy for you.
Take him!
He's got a plan!
I would be lost in Ohio.
Take him, please?
Please.
Please.
I've never even been to Ohio.
He was born and raised there.
He's Okay!
Okay!
Get out of here!
Anything's better than you!
- He's absolutely right about that, isn't he, Klinger?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Anything.
- Thank you, Klinger.
- Go on.
Get out ofhere.
Right.
Just a sec.
Klinger, I deeply appreciate your sacrifice for my safety and I sincerely hope that you survive this ordeal.
- Get lost!
- All right.
Getting lost.
-  - Charles!
-  Charles!
Thank goodness.
- Ladies and gentlemen - Are you all right, Major?
- Of course I'm all right.
- Now, we've gotta save Klinger.
- Tag team kidnapping.
The best thing to do in a situation like this is to give the kid what he asks for.
Look.
Can't we talk him out of there?
Tranquilize him, anything?
If talking hasn't done any good this far, he's beyond rational thinking.
I don't think Klinger's in any danger, unless we make some grandstand play.
We'll just sit tight and wait for that chopper.
- I'm starting to feel sick again.
- Take it easy, Margaret.
When all this is over, we'll go for a walk through the looking glass.
Believe you me, buddy as soon as we hit downtown Toledo, we're home free!
I know enough shady people and places there to keep us out of daylight for years.
But we'll make it.
Even if we have to struggle live on pita bread and water, sleep with the rats!
We We Kid, kid!
Come on!
Come on!
Look alive!
You gotta look alive if our scheme's gonna work.
- Okay.
All right.
-  Klinger, you still all right?
Oh, uh, fine, sir, just fine!
-  - But this guy, he's got a real mean look in his eyes, though.
- Ya better get that chopper.
-  It's here!
Anytime you're ready!
And tell Martinson there'll be no attempt to stop him.
- Do you hear that?
We're almost home!
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Come on, now walk tall.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay, Lieutenant.
Let's Let's move me out.
-  - Hut, two, three, four!
-  Oh, come on, kid.
Kid, you can do it.
You can do it.
So let's get out there and win one for the ol' Gipper!
So, kid, huh?
That's it.
Hut, two, three, four.
- Hut - Hut, two, three, four.
- Hut - Hut, two, three, four.
That's it, kid.
Ooh, you got it.
Now, you got it.
-  All right, everybody.
Stay back!
-  He's not afraid to use that thing.
He'll fill me full of lead.
- Take it easy, Klinger.
- I don't mind, sir.
I'll go all the way to Ohio if I have to.
It's in the line of duty.
Keep the gun up, kid.
You're doing great.
Wait a minute.
I'll be right back.
All right, get back!
Get back.
Don't rush him.
He could come to any second.
He's lost a lot of blood.
We'd better get him to O.R. -  Stretcher for this man.
Pronto!
- Oh, come on, kid.
You can't do this to me.
You can't!
- Well?
- Oh, my God.
This is incredible.
- What?
What?
- I never knew my thumb was this big.
- Oh, will you cut it out?
- All right.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- There.
- What?
- And the winner is - Pierce!
- Negative.
- Negative?
- Negative.
- Congratulations.
You're still a major, Major.
Yeah.
I guess I still am.
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- I'm glad it turned out the way you wanted it to.
So am I. I'm also sorry.
So am I. Okay, Fluffy.
One more time.
Easy now.
Actually, it's not all bad, you know.
Now you and Bongo can live in the same cage.
- Corporal?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh, excuse me for not saluting.
She needs me.
- Oh, that's okay.
Corporal, I just stopped by to, uh, well, to thank you again.
Now that it's over, that is.
Ooh.
You mean, you're not, uh - Uh.
-  No No, I'm not pregnant.
- Oh.
- Just a little gallbladder trouble.
- Oh.
- I want you to know I appreciate what you and Fluffy did - sacrificing her ovaries so that I could find out.
- Oh, that's okay, ma'am.
I know you'd do the same for Fluffy.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
-  - Mail!
Mail!
The mail's here!
Hold it, guys, hold it.
Come on.
Hey, let me through here.
Come on, come on, you guys.
This is government property.
Hold it, just hold it, will ya?
- Where ya been, Kelsey?
We ain't had mail in three weeks.
- Oh, write your congressman.
- By the time he gets it, he'll be out of office.
- Just sign it.
- Look out, look out, will ya?
Give a serviceman a break.
- Come on, Klinger, get down!
I ain't heard from my wife in two months!
It's drivin' me crazy!
- When I sort it, you'll get it.
- All right, you heard him.
When he sorts it, you'll get it.
Now move back everybody.
Stop.
- Gimme that, Radar.
- Hey, come on, hands off.
Hands off, Klinger.
Come on.
Don't torture me.
Two months I haven't heard from her and I want to know why.
- Hey, hey!
- I'm picking up her scent.
It always hits me like a wrecking ball.
Laverne, come out!
- Stop that!
- Radar, please.
My wife's in there.
Absolutely no.
Sniffin' the mail.
Holy cow.
- Oh, oh, come on.
- This is how we get camels to stand up in the desert.
My Uncle Ed used to do that.
He was Ow - Ah-ha!
- You dirty guy.
Gin.
I'm not playing with him anymore.
Too quick for me.
- Blitz you, my son.
- Mail's sorted.
Ah, the Shetland Pony Express.
You want yours here, Father, or in your tent when you're there?
Here'll be fine.
It's traveled far enough.
- Ah, a short note from my sister in the convent.
- Oh, a nun-o-gram.
Captain Hunnicutt, Captain Hunnicutt, Captain Hunnicutt.
- Those are for me.
- Ah.
You got a magazine and two letters.
Oh, great.
The bonus issue of Nudesweek.
This is the one where they announce the all-star volleyball team.
I voted for Ilsa the Magnificent.
I love to watch her spike.
- Dibs after you, sir.
- See me next month.
Right.
Uh, two letters for Major Winchester - and one for "Master Charles".
- From his mother.
Probably his allowance.
Hear!
Hear!
Good news for Our Lady of Hermosa basketball team.
A seven-foot-tall novice.
She could wear the hoop as a halo.
- Uh, Corporal.
- Oh, sorry, sir, here's your mail.
- Unopened, I trust.
- Of course, sir.
I wouldn't touch your allowance.
Beej, you remember last month when I got two letters for some other guy named Benjamin Pierce?
- Greatest love letters I've ever read.
- Here's another.
There are two of you, Pierce?
God help us all.
- Is it from Gloria or Joyce?
- Susan.
Another one?
This guy probably joined the war to get some sleep.
Nibbling on her shoulder blades in an avocado grove, and at harvest time.
She's turning me into guacamole.
- I shouldn't be listening to this.
- Neither should I. "I can still feel your hot breath on the nape of my neck".
I'll be moseying along now.
Say hello to my friends on the outside, will you?
Oh, here's the best part.
If I yawn, it's only in anticipation.
Fine.
I'll read it to B.J. - Oh, damn!
- Okay.
I'll read it to myself.
- Look what happens when a man's forced away from his home.
- What?
What?
Ah, Peg became a plumber for the first time.
Tried to fix the sink.
She now has a flooded kitchen and a cold.
- Wait a minute.
- What, what, what?
Went to a neighborhood party and one of our good neighbors made a pass at her.
- How did she handle it?
- She thought it was funny.
Ha ha.
Sounds like she handled it very well.
God, I wish I were home.
None of this would have happened if I'd been there.
Beej, aside from a damp kitchen, she's taking care of things.
Yeah, well, she shouldn't have to.
What am I doing here?
-  - You find that funny, Charles?
Certainly not.
At least I have received some good news.
Do you mind?
Forty percent of the Missouri sorghum crop was destroyed by hail.
Best news I've heard today.
No, you don't understand.
I'm heavily invested in Canadian sorghum.
People wiped out and all you can think of is yourself.
They have their interests.
I have mine.
What am I doing here?
Got some new snapshots of my grandson, Corey.
Wanna peek?
- Oh, yeah, sure, sir.
- Here he is in the sandbox.
Of course, you can't see him.
He just threw sand in the lens.
Here's one of him and his little friends on the swings.
The blur in the middle is him.
Boy, that Mildred is some photographer.
Yeah, he looks a lot like you, sir.
Radar, you can't even see him in any of these.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll look again, sir.
- What's the matter?
- Um, uh, it's personal.
- Oh, in that case, it's none of my business.
- My mom's got a boyfriend.
- She does?
Well, what's wrong with that?
Poor woman's been alone a long time.
Might be good for her.
Well, she's got my Uncle Ed though.
- Colonel, I've got to talk to you.
- Later.
I'm destroyed.
My world has collapsed.
My life is over.
Klinger, right now I need you like a double hernia.
Laverne wants a divorce.
She wants to divorce me.
Didn't we go through this routine before?
Oh, yeah.
The week after the Toledo scarlet fever epidemic.
- Where you goin', son?
- Oh, you're busy, sir.
We'll talk about it later, okay?
Colonel, in a family crisis, the Red Cross can fix it for me to go home - if you'll sign the papers.
- No!
And don't bug the Red Cross.
- They got enough trouble with their baloney sandwiches.
- But you don't understand.
Klinger, I understand only too well.
And this one isn't even original.
Blow!
Colonel, you've got to help me out.
Okay, here.
Put one foot after the other and you're out.
- Major.
- Major.
- Have you seen my tortoise pen?
My tortoise shell fountain pen?
- No.
I won it in a debate.
"Should the U.S. Permit more liberal immigration"?
- I, of course, took the negative.
- Ohh.
My family has had problems with immigrants ever since we came to America.
Aha, found it.
Oh, thank goodness, my nib is intact.
Fine.
I'm very happy for you.
Now please leave.
My, my, something certainly has you upset.
Look, Your Nibs, I'm very busy.
- I hope it's nothing I've done.
- No, it's a family matter.
- Oh, would you like to talk about it?
- No.
Margaret, I'm really interested in your welfare.
Share your troubles, it might help.
Sometimes getting it off your chest can be All right, all right.
I got a letter from my mother-in-law.
- Uh-huh.
- She still addresses me by my maiden name.
- How rude.
- She refuses to acknowledge our marriage.
- Unforgivable.
- She writes Donald constantly, recommending good lawyers.
She loves to drop in little phrases like "two different worlds" and "one's own kind".
- Yes, I'm familiar with those.
- But now this.
Donald put me up for an associate membership in the D.A.R., and she blackballed me.
- Well, that's understandable.
- What?
Margaret, the D.A.R. Has standards to maintain.
They can't let just anybody in.
You wouldn't be happy there.
People talking about things you wouldn't understand - and ignoring you in the process.
- Is that so?
Margaret, people like we Winchesters and the Penobscotts must constantly be on guard to maintain the integrity of how shall I say, the breed.
What am I, half schnauzer, half airedale?
Now, now, dear.
Inherited characteristics are extremely important and the bloodline is the key.
Most assuredly you are good breeding stock, wide pelvis.
- Ooh.
Good bones.
- Out!
- Firm muscle tone.
- Out!
- Excellent reflexes.
- Out!
Will you excuse me?
- No pies for you, and that's final!
-  I've never seen these fellows before.
They're marvelous.
They're so, uh, surrealistic.
- A guy makes a pass.
She laughs it off.
- Beej, cut it off at the pass.
It's just not like her.
She sounds less like herself with every letter.
You want to be depressed, watch the picture.
- I'm trying to watch the picture.
- Oh, Charles is trying to watch.
- Quiet everybody.
Go ahead, Charles.
Watch.
- Wombat.
-  Oh, there's Klinger's uncle.
-  -  - You don't seem to be enjoying the movie, son.
Old people shouldn't get married.
She's almost 50.
Are we watching the same movie?
- Would you mind?
- Oh, that's right.
You're watching.
Wait a minute, boys, I've got you all beat.
I've got five of a kind.
- What do you mean, five of a kind?
- Quintuplets.
- Who needs the D.A.R.?
- George Washington.
They gave him doughnuts and cocoa at Valley Forge.
Can't hear the dialogue!
I've never been to a movie with such rude people!
Usher!
Usher!
Throw these rowdies out!
-  Klinger.
- Get off my back!
Klinger, rethread the machine and get on with the show.
Rethread it yourself!
I've had it!
Colonel Potter.
Colonel Potter, he's walking out!
Klinger, come back here.
Now what in tarnation's going on?
I told you.
My wife's divorcing me.
Tell us after the movie.
Come on, let's watch it.
Klinger, save it for talent night.
I want somebody to listen to me.
- We've heard it all, Klinger.
- It's just another phony story.
No, it's not.
This is phony, sir.
This is!
And this here is phony, sir, and this.
All of this is phony.
But my wife leaving me isn't.
She took my allotment checks, built up a nice bank account and now she's found another guy.
I will never get to see the end of this movie.
Look, son.
We can't let every soldier who gets a "Dear John" letter go home.
- Nobody'd be left overseas.
- If I could just see her, talk to her.
I've known Laverne since we were kids.
I trusted her.
She was my lookout on fruit stand heists when I was 12.
The day I left, she promised to wait.
She didn't tell me some guy was gonna wait with her.
Well, at least you can talk to her.
Come on.
We'll put through a call.
Nah.
I don't wanna call.
The creep she's hooked up with might answer - and I couldn't handle that now.
- When you're ready, the line's yours.
This is the worst day of my life.
Don't be ridiculous.
You're gonna have a lot worse days than this.
Thank you, sir.
You've been away from each other for a long time.
She's got to become her own person.
- What if we become strangers?
- Oy.
- I need a baritone over here.
- Come on.
We need another Ink Spot.
- Come on.
What's it going to be, Father?
- "Button Up Your Overcoat".
- Fine.
Key of"L".
- ##   # Button up your overcoat # #When the wind blows free # #Take good care of yourself # #You belong to me # #Be careful crossing streets Ooh ooh # - Come on, Beej.
Sing.
- #Don't eat meats, Ooh ooh # # Cut out sweets Ooh ooh # #You'll get a pain and ruin your tum tum ## - Bartender.
- Take five, Pops.
- Give me a double.
- What do you say I take you home and put you to bed?
- Ah, you servicemen are all alike.
- Come on, come on.
- Bartender.
- Come on, you've had enough, doughboy.
Time for bed.
- May your fingers never lose their cunning.
- Ah.
See ya in church.
Have one on me, Klinger.
Matter of fact, I'll have one with ya.
- Excuse me, Father.
- Ah, Klinger, you wanna sing along?
No.
I don't know nothin' but torch songs.
- Can you lend me 20 bucks?
- Oh, I think so.
Gonna play poker, I assume.
Good.
It'll take your mind off your domestic problems.
I'm goin' A-W-O-L.
Oh, no, my son.
Don't do that.
Why, you could get into terrible trouble.
You could wind up in the stockade.
Who cares?
I gotta see her, Father.
- I gotta talk to her before she marries Morty.
- Morty?
Her guy.
Makes sausage casings.
Big hands.
Wish me luck.
- I can't let you do this.
- You want your 20 bucks back?
No.
Klinger, please.
Just promise me you'll think about this.
- Sleep on it.
We'll talk in the morning.
- I won't be here.
Then you give me no choice but to tell Colonel Potter.
- You'd squeal?
- Oh, for your own good.
Okay.
See you in the morning.
You won't regret this.
Sleep well.
Boy, you're no soft touch.
- Good night, Irene.
-  - Must be wonderful to have a second language.
-  - Sir?
- Shh!
The baby's asleep.
Yeah.
Can I, uh, can I talk to you?
Uh, let's sit on the veranda.
- Care to whittle?
- No, I'm too upset.
Oh, so talk about it.
- Well, you know my mother.
- Only by mail.
Well, you know she's been without my dad for a long time now.
- Yeah, I know.
- She started keeping company with this man.
He's been a teller at the Farmer's Bank for 30 years.
He's a third-degree Mason.
He's an elder in his church.
Sounds like a pretty shady character.
- Look, sir, I'm serious.
- Okay, I'm sorry.
What's the problem?
Well, I don't even know this guy, and he's going around with my mom.
It's, uh, look, bingo on Wednesday night at the Masonic Lodge.
On Friday, it's square dancing at the Pentecostal Church.
Every Sunday he gets her in his Nash Metropolitan and he takes her over to Lockport for sno-cones.
- Just the two of 'em.
They never stop.
It's go, go, go!
- So what's wrong, wrong, wrong?
Old people aren't supposed to go runnin' around like that.
Sure they are.
I think it's great.
Well, yeah, but what if he, uh suppose he wants to horse around?
Great.
It's good for the cardiovascular system.
Come on!
This is my mom we're talkin' about!
Radar, she's a woman.
She's a warm human being.
Where do you think you came from, the Monkey Ward catalogue?
- That was my regular father.
- Radar.
Radar, you're jealous.
- Me?
Jealous?
- Yeah, sure.
You have to share her with somebody else for the first time since you were a little kid.
Yeah.
Maybe I am jealous.
I was the same way.
The same thing happened to me.
My father's a widower, you know.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You mean, just like my mom?
- Yeah, right.
When I was about 12 years old he got interested in this very nice lady.
She was a bookkeeper.
And I was sore as hell.
I didn't say anything, but he knew I was sore.
And he really wanted me to like her, but I wouldn't.
Anyway.
Well, I guess he needed my approval so much that, uh he didn't marry her.
And he's been alone to this day.
And loneliness is everything it's cracked up to be.
Yeah, I guess it is.
So, with your mother, I'd-I'd wait and see what happens.
Yeah, well, if you say so.
Uh, but you know, I was thinking um, if it doesn't work out maybe we could introduce your dad to my mom.
- Radar.
Radar, come on, wake up.
- What is it, sir?
What?
I wanna use your phone to call San Francisco.
- Oh, for Pete's sake.
- Come on, come on.
- Radar, come on.
It's important.
- Oh, come on.
No, forget it.
All right.
I'll do it myself.
Just tell me where to plug this thing in.
Oh!
Why can't anybody ever use this darn phone during the daytime?
Oh, Radar, I can't wait that long.
Listen, I owe you one, okay?
Oh, oh, oh, boy, if I had an hour's sleep for every time somebody ever said that to me.
- Her number in San Francisco is 555 - 555-2657.
I know.
And I'm hurrying!
It must be quarter to 3:00 in the morning.
Sparky?
Y Sparky, I know it's quarter to 3:00 in the morning.
You owe him one too, sir.
Listen, uh, this is an urgent phone call to San Francisco.
Right.
- There's 25 bucks in it for you.
- What?
I didn't think you'd mind.
- Okay.
Right.
Go ahead.
I'll I'll just stand by.
- Wh-Wh-What's the problem?
Hey, this is gonna take a few minutes, you know!
There's static over Honolulu!
Oh, great.
It's probably those electric ukuleles.
Oh, great.
It's probably those electric ukuleles.
- Hey!
-  What?
His head isn't on too good either!
-  - Who is it?
- Father Mulcahy.
Something terrible has happened.
- What?
- May I come in?
- Get in here.
- I've done a very foolish thing.
- You, Father?
I could have stopped him and I didn't.
- Now he's gone AWOL behind my back.
- Who?
I stopped by to look in on him and now he's gone.
- Klinger?
- Yes.
- When?
- I was talking to him in the Officers Club around 11:00 and now it's about 3:00.
I should say somewhere between 11:00 and 3:00.
Pretty good guess.
Well, let's get on the horn and try to lasso him.
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
Ah, it's okay.
I have to get up in another six hours anyway.
Peggy, I realize it's embarrassing, honey, but you've got to do it.
- What's goin' on here?
- Uh, Colonel, uh Captain Hunnicutt has a very serious family crisis.
You took the car to Ron's Service Station and he wants $425?
Peggy, you only go there for gas and air and sometimes they charge for the air.
Hunnicutt, get off that phone.
You let him call his wife about a car?
Well, Captain Hunnicutt's a captain, Colonel.
Just a second, Colonel.
Honey, there's a place in San Rafael called Gene's Body Works.
Go there.
Tell Gene you're my wife.
He's an old friend of mine.
We played football together in high school.
He'll give you a good price.
Hunnicutt, right now.
Klinger's gone A-W-O-L.
Every minute counts.
Sweetheart, I gotta get off the phone.
What?
Why did I call ya?
- Aw, come on.
-  Come on.
I I just wanted to check and see if you still need me, Peg.
Well, does she?
That's good to hear, sweetheart.
Ah, she does.
I need you too, darling.
Bye.
Hallelujah.
Is everything all right?
Always was.
- Get on the phone.
- Right.
Call the M.P.s. Notify them about Klinger.
Colonel, they could go rough on him.
Tell them to take it easy.
Just bring him back, so I can have a crack at him.
-  - Come in, but wipe your feet first.
- Captain Pierce?
- That.
Captain Pierce, I'm Captain Pierce.
Huh?
Oh, the letter snafu.
Ohh.
I was passing through, and I thought we could exchange our mail.
It's a pleasure to meet me.
Let me introduce you to the boys in the band.
- B.J. Hunnicutt, C.E. Winchester.
- How do you do?
What was the name again?
Pierce.
Benjamin Pierce.
I, for one, will never forget.
- Here are your letters.
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, isn't that nice?
All unopened.
- Mm-hmm.
Pity you can't extend the same courtesy to Captain Pierce.
I don't understand.
You mean you looked at my letters?
Well, one of them fell on the ground and broke open.
- What do you mean, broke open?
- That was just a little levity to ease the tension.
I just I only read one of them.
Uh, which one was that, Pierce?
The one from Sheila, Joyce or Gloria?
- Take the fifth, Hawk.
- Hey, Captain, that's not a nice thing to do.
Look, I'm sorry, but up here a letter, any letter, is as good as gold, and yours are platinum.
- Yes, you're quite a Romeo.
- No, no, I'm no Romeo.
You're not?
I don't do that well in my dreams.
I wish they'd stop writing me.
I never answer them.
I tell you what.
I'll write to them.
I've always wanted to be a foreign correspondent.
What do you mean, a foreign correspondent?
Joke.
Little joke.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well, I'll take my letters now.
I guess I should read them.
He guesses he should read them.
- Okay.
- Thanks.
Well, nice meeting you.
Wait, wait just a second.
I-I No-No offense, Pierce but you don't exactly look like Clark Gable and you don't sound like Ronald Colman and you don't move like Fred Astaire.
- How do you do it?
- Do what?
- Get all the girls to go wild about ya.
- Oh, that.
Uh, I guess it's 'cause I make them laugh.
- I beg your pardon?
- I make them laugh.
It's my sense of humor.
I'm a very funny guy.
He's a very funny guy.
It's Klinger.
Holy Toledo, it's Klinger.
Colonel!
Colonel, it's Klinger.
He's back.
Out of my way.
Thank God he's back alive.
I'm gonna kill him.
You jackass!
What kind of idiotic stunt was that?
For two cents, I'd slam you in the hoosegow and throw away the key.
- Welcome home, Klinger.
- Joyriding around Korea in the middle of the night.
Could've gotten yourself killed!
Now what do you have to say for yourself?
- Colonel, I gotta tell you - I don't want to hear it!
- The Colonel was worried sick about you.
- Not sick, just worried.
Well, come on.
Let's hang up your undies.
- Radar, would you handle - I understand, sir.
Thanks.
Family.
I was this close, Colonel.
I had my reservations and everything.
Deluxe accommodations in the baggage compartment of a C-47.
I bumped a general's poodle to get on.
- What stopped you?
- When I was waiting for the plane I had some time to really think about what she had done to me.
- She had no right.
Not while I was here.
- Agreed.
Don't forget under all the feathers and laces beats the heart of a real man.
I got my pride, and if she don't want me, then I don't want her.
- Now you're talkin'.
- Let her have Morty.
She'll probably eat all that free sausage and blow up like an elephant.
- Serves her right.
- You deserve a lot better.
Don't I know it.
Besides, this hitch is bad enough.
I don't want to spend the next one in jail.
I have scruples, you know.
When I leave the army, it'll be the honorable way with a Section Eight.
That's it, son.
Always go with your best pitch.
How about letting me buy you a drink?
Yeah, sure.
They didn't even have a lounge at that crummy airport.
You know, Colonel, there are a lot more women than there are guys in America.
- True.
- And the women got most of the money - stocks, bonds, stuff like that.
- Right.
So there's got to be a rich, beautiful dame out there for an attractive lunatic like me.
Hang tough, kid.
You know what I'm in the mood for?
A banana daiquiri.
#Take good care of yourself You belong to me ## - Hey, hey!
- All right.
To Max Klinger.
- Korea's most eligible bachelor.
- Hear!
Hear!
May you find a wife who dresses as well as you do.
- Oh, okay.
- Corporal, my hat is off to you.
Not to mention his hair.
What you did takes daring and courage.
God bless you.
I was going to say that.
Your turn, uh, Radar.
- Your turn, Radar.
- It's okay, Ma, throw the bouquet.
It's his last Shirley Temple with the three-beer chaser.
Hey!
I-I-I-I wanna make a toast.
- To MASH 4077 Seven.
- Seven.
I may not have a family no more in Toledo, but I sure got one here.
- Hear!
Hear!
- I love you guys.
Pretty rotten way to show it.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
So it'll be an even horse trade.
The 8063 will send over their chest cutter and a nurse to observe our methods while you two sniff around their ballpark for a week.
Pierce, are you listening to me?
- I'm all ears, Colonel.
- You're all eyes, Captain.
- That's 'cause you're all there, Lieutenant.
- Down, Rover, and listen up.
Now, the C.O. Of the 8063 is a guy I served with in Europe.
His name's Wheatley, and he's a stickler for regulations, especially hair length.
- We used to call him "Old Whitewalls".
- I'll pin my hair under my hat.
- Better cut those sideburns.
- I know these temporary switcheroos are a royal pain in the saddle blanket.
Why don't we just stay home tonight?
You slip into something comfortable.
I'll jump in after.
I'd love to, Pierce, but in the long run, this program will be a big help to all the MASHs.
It's just that with new people coming in, you never know what to expect.
- Well, do you know who they're sending?
- I don't know about the nurse but the surgeon is a guy named Dupree.
- He's supposed to be a whiz with the knife.
- Yeah, but can he mambo like me?
All right.
Just soak in as much information as you can while you're there.
- We'll be fine.
- Oh, we'll be fine.
- There's a jeep waiting outside.
- I thought we were going by Pullman car.
Pierce, good luck, and watch out for Colonel Wheatley.
Bigelow, good luck, and watch out for Captain Pierce.
-  A little to the left, dear.
- If I move it to the left it will not be pointing toward Boston.
What difference does it make?
Nobody's going to Boston anyway.
Just knowing where it is is a great comfort to me.
I'd like to go to Boston and visit all those historic sites.
You know: Concord, Bunker Hill, the Red Sox.
Oh!
Sometimes you say the most amusing things even if you don't realize it.
Why, Charles, we are in a jovial mood today, aren't we?
Our jovial mood is directly due to the fact that your partner in perversion left this camp exactly 57 minutes ago.
That gives me 167 hours and three minutes without the displeasure of Pierce's company.
- The very prospect of it makes me ecstatic with anticipation.
-  Yeehaw!
- Gesundheit.
- End of the line, little lady.
- You bet it is, partner.
-  Howdy there, cowboy.
Howdy.
The name's Dupree, Roy Dupree, from the 8063.
- See?
It sort of rhymes.
- We've been expecting you.
Hunnicutt's my name.
Call me B.J.
This is Corporal O'Reilly, our company clerk.
- Yeah.
You can call me Radar.
Sorry.
I don't rhyme.
-  Oh.
Well, tie me to a anthill and smear my ears with jam.
Where are my manners?
J.B., Radar, I want y'all to meet the prettiest little filly to ever suture a belly wound: Captain Lo-rain Anderson.
Sometimes it's pronounced Lorraine.
Sometimes mine's pronounced "B.J." -  How you do there, big fella?
- I do very well, thank you.
- Charles Emerson Winchester at your service.
- How do you do?
- I'm Captain Anderson.
- Lorraine.
Yes, I heard.
No.
Permit me.
- Where should I bring the captain's bags, sir?
- Put 'em in the Swamp, Radar.
- Roy'll bunk with us.
How 'bout some coffee?
- Thank you kindly, J. J. - Oh, where would I find Margaret Houlihan?
- Do you know the major?
She and I go back longer than either of us care to admit.
- Looking at you, that still can't be very far.
- Well thank you.
You'll find Major Houlihan in the lab.
It's over there.
- Surprise!
- Ow!
You idiot!
Lorraine!
I can't believe it!
- It's been so long!
Fort Benning.
- What are you doing here?
- Three years!
- Three years.
Let me look at you.
Let me look.
- Oh, my gosh.
Look how thin you are!
- Bad food and hard work.
- I thought you were in Hawaii.
- I guess they figured I'd had enough of paradise.
- I've been with the 8063rd for a month.
- Oh, my God!
- This is so terrific!
- Ah.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- What?
What?
- It's closed up.
- What?
- The earlobe.
- Let me see.
Let me see.
- You remember when we got our ears pierced?
Two 15-year-old army brats piercing their ears.
Melted down my father's medals to make earrings.
- Was he furious!
- Can you blame him?
His best days in the army dangling from our earlobes?
- So, how've you been?
You happy?
- Ohh.
- You're married?
- Yeah.
- Well, how is it?
- Not so good.
- Ohh.
Well, tell me about it.
- Donald is gorgeous, brilliant, and he's gonna be a general.
We could have so much together, but he's in Tokyo.
And it's very hard to squeeze a marriage through a tiny little telephone wire.
- Hey, this war isn't gonna last forever.
- It already has.
Ah.
Listen.
The terrible twins are together again.
- Now, here's the plan.
- Uh-oh.
- We re-pierce our ears - I knew it.
- And go find your colonel and melt down all his medals!
-  Ooh-whoo!
Well, strap my face to the side of a pig and roll me in the mud.
If this ain't the dandiest "de-core".
We call it junkyard provincial.
We had the Bowery Boys in to decorate.
I'm gonna fit in here real fine.
Well, I see Hoot Gibson has taken up residence.
Charles, you're just in time for a drink to celebrate the arrival of our new Swamp rat.
- Hip-hip.
- Hey there, Chuckwagon.
We never did meet proper-like.
- Roy Dupree from the 8063.
See?
- Yes, I know.
It rhymes.
I Dupree, I heard.
Let me be brutally candid.
I find your sense of humor mawkish and your personality boorish, to say the least.
I appreciate your opinion, good buddy, but it don't change my mind.
I still like ya.
Good Lord.
He means it.
- Gentlemen, how 'bout a toast?
- That's a good idea.
Uh, here's to the three of us.
We're gonna have more fun than a mosquito in a blood bank!
The cruelties of war continue to amaze me.
Why don't you boys put some whiskey in this punch?
You were a fire-eater before you were a doctor.
Shoot.
Down home, my mama'd sprinkle this stuff on her ironing board.
Here.
Have mine.
Where did you get your medical degree, Dupree?
- Yes, I know.
It rhymes.
- University of Arkansas, '44.
Soueee, pig!
Gee, I'll bet you were top bumpkin in your class.
I love the way this boy tugs at my leg.
Lot of bulldog in you.
I bet you went to Yale.
Harvard!
Harvard.
Here.
Try this on your ironing board.
Why don't you ask me to do something hard?
Where'd you boys get this iced tea, anyway?
Right over there in the still of the night.
Well, Lord, would you look at that!
Now, that reminds me of home.
Your design's all right, but your engineering's all wrong.
Looky here, B.G. You got your coil wound too tight here.
No wonder this stuff's got the kick of a 90-year-old chorus girl.
- Careful, Roy.
That coil might break.
- Oh.
I'm sorry, B.G. - "J".
- Let me fix it for ya, J.G. Boors of a feather should bunk together, I always say.
Attention, all personnel.
Choppers arriving.
Incoming wounded.
- All medical teams to O.R. - Hot damn!
It rains here too, don't it?
- Come on, boys.
Let's go to work.
-  Roy, do us a favor.
Don't try to straighten out any colons.
- This old boy's all right.
Get him to post-op.
-  More suction here.
- I can't see.
-  Need any help?
Let me.
I got a free hand here.
The price is right.
I'll take it.
Partial hepatectomy.
Caught enough shrapnel to make chopped liver.
- That ain't where all the blood's comin' from.
- No.
There's an arterial bleeder under the liver, but I can't get both hands in to tie it off.
You got any 3.0 silk?
- You just watch this, Colonel.
- This is no time to practice up on slipknots, Captain.
I'm gonna lasso that sucker and tie him off neater than a runaway calf at brandin' time.
- Retractor.
- I gotta get under there.
- That's it.
Suction.
Clamp, clamp.
- Ride 'em, cowboy, cowboy.
I cannot wait for his last roundup.
Gotta hand it to you, Dupree.
You know your beeswax.
You're just what the doctor ordered.
You see, Captain?
Severe kidney damage.
But we found if we can save the lower pole, he should have fairly normal function.
- You do marvelous work.
- Yeah.
I just love playing doctor.
While you're playing, Hunnicutt, do explain to her that the ureter is the key.
If that is not salvageable, you can write off the entire kidney.
- He seems very sure of himself.
- Oh, yes.
- I like that.
- Captain Anderson, I'm about to save this boy's leg with a very delicate arterial transplant.
- Care to be fascinated?
- I'd love to.
Excuse me.
Scalpel.
It's time to give up the theater.
They're starting to walk out on me.
No, no, no, my dear.
You-You come closer.
Good.
All right.
Hold the clamp exactly like that.
And now, in the center ring, Major Charles Emerson Winchester and his performing ego.
- Very skillful, Doctor.
- And you're very observant, Captain.
- What are you doing after the operation?
- What did you have in mind?
Well, I thought we'd avoid the Mess Tent and have dinner together.
I'm sure I can scrape up potluck from my larder if, of course you don't mind having red wine with the squab.
- You're unbelievable.
- That's right.
Hey, you two.
No hand-holding in the abdominal cavity.
Yes, and can we please keep the conversation on a professional level?
- That'd be a first.
- Come on.
We always talk professional.
"Clamp".
"Sponge".
"Shower cap".
"Rubber duck".
I just love the way y'all josh around.
Damn.
This is more fun than skinny-dippin' in a creek with the Pittman sisters.
Captain Dupree, there are ladies present.
- And accounted for?
- Not since last year.
- Oh?
-  Excuse me, but this is an operating room and not the back of a school bus.
Come on.
We were just making conversation, Margaret.
It's "Major," Captain.
You're distracting the doctor.
Not at all.
The doctor's doing very well, Margaret.
Captain Anderson, if you don't mind, I'd like to speak with you after this session.
- Come off it, Major.
We were just - After the session.
Ooh-whee!
I do love women with spunk!
- What was all that about?
- That's what I was gonna ask you.
- Are you telling me I did something wrong in there?
- Surgery is not a sexual sandbox.
What are you saying?
That's the way it always is in there.
- Flirting is just a way of killing time.
- Listen, Lorraine.
I'm head nurse, and I'm here to see that nothing gets killed, including time.
All right, Major.
Just a minute, Lorraine.
You've changed a little, you know?
Hey, spitfire, you sure kicked up a lot of dust in there.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
But I do love a woman with spunk.
Why don't you go sit on a steer's horn?
Well, maybe not that much spunk.
So, we're sitting at Gilhooly's having our 10th nightcap and holding off two persistent interns.
Well, suddenly Margaret realizes we have a microbiology exam in three hours.
We knew we were in big trouble, but we raced home and made up crib notes and stuffed them in our bra.
- I'm sorry, Father.
- That's all right.
I'm glad Hawkeye isn't here.
He'd do 20 minutes on that.
- Well, the exam had 500 questions.
- That's 250 answers per bra.
- Don't you dare say, "Sorry, Father".
- You can guess how many times we asked to be excused from the classroom.
- Lorraine, must you go into every detail?
- Come now, Margaret.
Everyone has a little scarlet in their past.
Go on, Lorraine.
Well, finally, the instructor got wise, and she wouldn't let us leave anymore.
But by that time, we had to go for real.
I never wrote so fast in all my life.
And you should've seen Margaret hopping around on one foot.
Really?
Margaret?
Where did you find this girl?
She's just delightful.
I'm glad you like her.
- What's wrong with her?
- I thought maybe you'd know.
Sorry, Tex.
All out of beef jerky today.
Come on.
You've been laughin' at me since you got here.
Cut it out.
- People are starting to talk.
- Well, you look so darn ridiculous in that getup.
Ridiculous?
The pearls too much?
Look, cowboy, call me "wacko," "eight ball," "loco," and even "crazy" but don't laugh at my Bonwit Teller.
I can't help it.
You're so funny lookin'.
Oh, yeah?
Well, take a few shingles of that and that.
I wanna hear you laugh after this.
Next!
Mind if I join y'all?
Here.
Take our seats.
We were just leaving.
Weren't we, my dear?
You will excuse me, gentlemen.
I have to be around him all the time.
Well, you certainly must like bad food, son.
Are you kiddin'?
This is A-1 prime chow.
Now, if you wanna choke on your cud, try eatin' over at the 8063.
Boy, that is bad.
- I guess Hawkeye must be just eatin' his heart out.
- Hey, B.B. Now, I was thinkin'.
We could put up some hides and a couple of shrunken heads I got and that old Swamp'd take shape, you'll see.
Roy, you got a real flair, but you're only gonna be around here for a couple days.
Hey, now.
Just stay up in the saddle there a sec.
I like it fine around here, and I intend to ask the colonel to let me stay on permanent.
- Permanent, as in forever?
- Yeah.
We'll have a big ol' time.
Partyin' every night.
And when I party, I party hearty.
Well, you know, Roy, we kind of like our peace and quiet around here too.
Oh, I get it.
Father, now, you ought to ease up on these boys.
- Hey, Roy - Hold it, B.B. "Padree," like the next man, I believe in a little religion but I also believe in a lot of good, clean, dirty fun.
I'll forgive you for what you just said, but then, I'm in the forgiving business.
- Hey, Father.
I - Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Roy, why don't you give your mouth a day of rest?
- I didn't mean nothin' by that.
-  Colonel.
- Hey!
Colonel Potter!
-  Colonel.
- Hey!
Colonel Potter!
- Excuse me, B.B. - B.J. B.J. - Colonel Potter, sir.
- You hooted, Captain?
Uh, yes, sir.
You know, I was thinkin' that the 4077's just about the friendliest MASH unit I ever seen.
I mean, good chow, good working conditions and the nurses, they're something special.
You headed somewhere with this or just grazin'?
Well, sir, I was just wonderin' if you could use another hired hand around here.
- You mean a permanent transfer?
- It'd make me happier than a cow with a bellyful of calf.
Well, why not?
I like your style, and we can always use another chest cutter.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you, sir.
Thank you kindly.
Yeehaw!
I found myself a home.
Can you imagine what it's gonna be like if Potter arranges that transfer?
- It'll be like living in a prairie purgatory.
- ## ##  - Sounds like our boy has discovered Rosie's bar.
- Hey!
How's my old Swamp buddies?
Ah, how you doin' there, B.J.?
Ha.
Fooled ya, didn't I?
Hey, how come you can't have a name like everybody else?
Now, you take ol' Chuckwagon here.
Come on, Slop-along.
Time for you to drawl into bed.
Hey, I used to ride my daddy's ponies like this back home.
- Oh, did you, now?
- Get along, horsie!
Likes horses, does he?
Hunnicutt, is it your turn to take Sophie for a walk or mine?
- Sophie?
- Mm.
R-i-i-ight.
Right.
- I think it's mine.
- Darn.
Hey.
Who's Sophie?
What's she look like?
Oh, about 6'8", hairy legs, longest nose you've ever seen.
You mean that guy in the dress?
Not Klinger.
No.
This is the company horse.
You boys got a horse here in the compound?
Sort of the camp mascot.
Do you ride?
Why, I was ridin' bareback before I could even speak.
Hey, what do you say?
Can l Can I ride her?
- It's all right with me.
What do you think, Charles?
- Well, all right.
- But just this once.
- Hey, let me at her!
- The stable's right behind the motor pool.
- Gotcha!
Right behind the motor pool!
Yahoo!
Did he fall for that!
- Not as hard as Potter's gonna fall on him.
- Oh, Charles, you're beautiful.
- Where'd you learn to be so sneaky and underhanded?
- From you and Pierce.
- It's the sole area in which both of you excel.
- You're too kind.
- After you.
- As it should be.
I thought you'd be happier in the Nurses' Tent.
Oh, yeah?
Kind of you.
Perhaps I would be.
I wanna know one thing before I go.
What happened to your ears?
- What?
- You used to have pierced ears.
Now they're closed over.
You're all closed over.
There's not an open spot anywhere on you.
What happened to you?
Do you mean, why don't I act childish and undignified and silly?
- Why don't you have fun?
- I'm not here to have fun!
I'm head nurse.
I've got responsibilities.
Damn it!
A lot of people depend on me!
Do you know how hard that is to live up to?
Margaret, do you hear yourself?
You sound like one of those rigid, sour, old nurses we used to make fun of.
All right.
I've said enough.
I'll go.
Wait a minute.
I'd like to tell you something.
When you first got here, it was like looking at a picture of us in a family album.
I loved you.
And then later, I hated you.
For God's sakes.
Why?
Because you're still as free and open as we both were then, and I'm not.
No, you're not.
What happened?
No, you're not.
What happened?
I don't know.
One night, I was at a party drinking and dancing and the next morning, I was in a war in charge of 10 nurses, and the party was over.
I was afraid if I didn't get tough, they'd get soft.
You mean, you were just plain afraid.
Maybe I was.
I guess so, yes.
Margaret, you can't let this happen to you.
You can't let "Major Houlihan" take over your whole life.
That khaki's got to come off at night.
I don't know any other way anymore.
It's been too long.
Why don't you just try letting your hair down with your friends now and then?
I don't have any friends here.
What about your husband?
Isn't he a friend?
A friend?
He's barely a husband.
You know what I was thinking the other night?
That he's more like a toy soldier I play with sometime.
The worst of it is there's nobody I can tell that to.
Sure there is.
You have a whole camp of people out there if you'll just let them in.
- It isn't that easy.
- Margaret, you make it difficult.
You try so hard to be perfect, you make it impossible for anyone to please you.
Why don't you ease up a little, let people know you're human?
Let 'em know what I've always known what a a warm, caring person you really are.
Yeehaw!
Come on, Sophie!
- Ride 'em, cowboy!
- Get along, little doggie!
Get along!
Come on!
Get up, girl!
Whoo!
Giddyap!
Giddyap, Sophie!
Me and you!
Come on!
Giddyap!
- What the hell's goin' on out here?
- Ride 'em, cowboy!
- What's that idiot doin' on my Sophie?
- Taking a moonlight ride.
- Dupree!
- That's me!
Ha!
- Come on, Sophie!
- Dismount that animal immediately.
That's an order.
Good girl, Sophie.
I'm sorry.
This wasn't my idea.
Rough and ready to go again, Colonel!
Load her up in the chute!
Dupree, I don't ever wanna see you around this horse or my camp again.
In fact, this war ain't big enough for the two of us.
Come on, Soph.
You can step on his hat if you want to.
- Hey, Roy, ol' partner.
- Oh Did I do something wrong?
- No.
Not at all.
- You were perfect.
Oh, well, this is it.
Ahh.
- I love you, you know?
- I know.
How was I supposed to know it was the colonel's horse?
- It's a gol-durn shame, ain't it?
- Colonel said you'd better be out of town by sundown.
My head's the size of a blue-ribbon hog.
Lorraine, here.
Let me carry your luggage for you.
Why, thank you.
Always a gentleman.
I've been saving an old bottle of Beaujolais for a special occasion.
Perhaps we could share it to wish you a bon voyage?
Charles, I'd love to, but, uh, somebody has to drive this thing.
- I've enjoyed our time together.
- So have I. You are certainly one of a kind.
Yes.
I Thank you.
I ha Thank you.
- Have a safe trip.
- Don't worry about me.
With Roy along, it's the Chinese that are in trouble.
Ready to ride, Paul Revere?
You want me to drive?
Mmm, no.
You just watch out for redcoats.
- Good-bye, everybody.
-  Good-bye.
- See you soon, Margaret.
- Yeah, you bet.
Yahoo!
It's through!
Rhymes.
- Where you going?
- Who are you talking to?
Well, the two of you.
Where are you going?
Oh, I don't know.
I've got a letter from Peg I've only read twice.
I was going in the Swamp and revel in the quiet.
How 'bout a cup of coffee in the Mess Tent?
I'm buying.
- Sure, Margaret.
Sounds fine.
- Good.
- I thought maybe we could talk.
- Talk?
- Yeah.
Just talk.
- Sure.
Talk.
- Right, Charles?
- Right.
Talk.
Thanks.
I knew it.
Turn my back for a week, and the help is into the cooking sherry.
- Welcome back, stranger.
- Pierce, do sit down.
- Regale us with tales of your adventures of the 8063rd.
- Yeah.
How'd it go?
- They hated me.
- Huh.
Really?
Doctors, nurses, everybody.
Kept telling me I was dull.
They said you guys got the better deal.
- The guy was fantastic.
- Hated to see him go.
- Oh, yeah?
- No offense.
- No, no, no, no.
- We're kind of sorry you're back.
Oh.
Thanks a lot.
Pierce, I never thought the day would come when I would admit this but God, I missed you!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
If you need me in Seoul, I'll be with General Kent at "l" Corps in the morning and at headquarters in the afternoon.
No, sir.
You'll be at Headquarters in the morning and "l" Corps in the afternoon.
- Like I said.
- Cabbie, Radio City Music Hall, and step on it.
There's an extra five for you if we get there in time for the Rockettes.
- Sorry, I'm off duty.
- Where you staying?
- Officers' quarters.
- Big mistake.
That's only a one-star hotel.
Enemy P.O.W. Camps get two stars.
The place you want is Uncle Chang's Changri-La Hotel.
What's so good about it, besides the name?
The bellboys are all girls.
They don't carry your bags but they take off their shoes and walk barefoot through your back.
Oh, wow.
Wouldn't that be something, sir?
To have a real beautiful bellhop with naked feet, and he - I mean, she -  Steady, Radar.
Yes, sir.
Want me to change your reservations?
- No.
- That's the last time I arrange a tour for you.
Just for that, I'm not gonna tell you how the chambermaids wake you up.
- Have a nice, boring trip.
- Are you gonna be back in time for the Derby Day party?
Wild racehorses couldn't keep me away.
With Hawkeye and B.J. Giving it, it oughta be a real wingding.
Everybody's gotta show up in jockey shorts.
Change that to nobody.
Got it?
- Not even the nurses, sir?
- Not even.
So hold your lower lip still.
It's quivering.
This is Class "A", number-one hooch, Waldo but it's way too smooth.
I'm used to putting my fist through the wall to help get it down.
Oh, boy, it's good to see ya, Sherm.
You're looking great.
That's the fourth "good to see ya" and the second "looking great" since I walked in here.
What's on your mind, Waldo?
Sherm, you and I have been friends for a long time.
- Here it comes.
- I've heard a lot of talk about you Negative talk about you and the 4077 th.
What is it this time?
Somebody forgot to wear their dress gloves in surgery?
This is different, Sherm.
Lack of leadership.
Lapses of discipline.
Bypassing regulations.
- Apparently some of your people aren't too happy with you.
- What do you mean, "my people"?
The beefs are coming from inside your unit.
I can't believe that.
Would I have brought you up here if I thought it was the usual latrine scuttlebutt?
My own people?
It happens.
But, Sherm, if this sort of thing keeps up, the Spam could hit the fan.
I don't understand it.
Sherm, you have one year to retirement.
Now, let's make it an easy one.
I can transfer you to any stateside post you want.
You name it.
And you don't know who's sending these reports?
All I know is it's an inside job.
What difference does it make?
What difference?
a roster of people.
It's my family.
Up until now, my loyal family.
Yep, this sure is first-class hooch, all right.
You got any rotgut?
Attention, all personnel.
Decorative bunting is needed for tonight's Kentucky Derby party.
All those hoarding toilet paper are asked to please give from the heart.
- Hi, y'all and everyone else.
- Hi, Hawkeye.
Mornin', Beauregard.
How's the mint julep comin'?
A regular Louisville Slugger.
Taste it yourself.
- Needs more julep.
- Uh-huh.
By the by, what are you using for mint?
- Green cough medicine.
- Mmm.
Antiseptic and antebellum.
I refuse to put lime icing on a chocolate cake.
That's the whole theme of the party Derby Day.
Kentucky?
The green grass?
In the first place, Kentucky grass is blue.
In the second, I'm the chef, and the icing will be white.
Hold it.
Cease and desist.
Argument about the cake?
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll settle this.
This the recipe?
- Perfect.
Carry on.
- With lime icing.
Look, Major, I'm not even supposed to be here.
I was held over by him and the other captain to bake a cake.
- So let me bake it, will you?
- Is this man occupying a bed in post-op just so he can sneak back here and bake?
Margaret, post-op is half empty.
And you're talking to a man who in civilian life, taught pastry at the Cordon Bleu in Paris.
No, I was Speedy's Eats in New Orleans.
- Same thing.
- Here's the wreath.
Amazing what can be done with a box of Kleenex and a bottle of rosewater.
If I catch anybody blowing his nose in this, he's gonna lose it.
Hey, Hawk.
Try the julep now.
Oh, that's it.
Make an extra batch.
What we don't drink we can use as insect repellent.
Right on through, Colonel.
Have a refreshing trip, sir?
Take that stuff off.
You look like a fool.
Where's Radar?
- Making party favors, sir.
May I talk to you?
- No.
Then I'll be brief.
I'd like you to transfer me to the M.P.s. - Out of my way, flatfoot.
- I could do a great job escorting prisoners to the States.
Just sign here, sir, for the cause of justice.
- Come to attention.
- Yes, sir!
About face.
Now stay that way until you receive further orders.
- But I have a beat to patrol.
- Colonel, good to see you.
How was your trip?
We missed you around here.
Save it for Sunday.
# Oh, the sun shines bright # # On my old Kentucky home # # On my old Kentucky home # # Far away ##  Belly up to the bowl, Colonel.
You're just in time for "slap happy hour".
How was everything in Seoul, the Jersey City of the Orient?
I thought this party wasn't supposed to leave the starting gate till 1:30 a.m. We figured we'd indulge in a few furlongs now so we'd start with a handicap.
- You're a few lengths behind us.
Join the fun.
- The fun is over.
- Give you people an inch, you take a mile.
- Tonight, a mile and a quarter.
Quiet, Pierce!
- What's this patient doing here?
- Recovering nicely, thank you.
Don't let them fool you, Colonel.
These two kept him from rejoining his unit so that he could bake a cake with the wrong icing.
- Is this true?
- Every layer of it.
If there's one thing I can't abide, it's two commissioned teenagers who feel they can break regulations anytime the mood hits them.
- Darn tootin'.
- But what's worse is a snitch someone who can't settle a matter face-to-face.
- I resent that, Colonel.
- Tough.
Colonel, I'm glad you're back, sir.
See what I made?
Party favors.
Horses and jockeys.
Where the hell have you been?
Well?
Uh I had to go to Supply to get the paper and then I had to go cut out the horses.
Then I had to get a picture to see how long to make the tail when I cut it out.
Get me a duty roster.
I wanna see where all these people belong.
Yes, sir.
Uh, we belong in Supply.
Then get there.
The rest of you get where you're supposed to be.
-  -  - What's wrong with him?
- I said to the man "Go to Changri-La.
Get your back walked on".
But does he listen to his doctor?
No.
- Colonel Potter.
- What do you want?
Just the man I want to see.
This day is getting better and better.
I'm sure this will be as unpleasant for you as it is for me but I hold you personally responsible for ruining my medical career.
- You don't say.
- It is six months to the day since I was shanghaied into this quagmire.
Congratulations.
Then this is a commemorative meeting.
If it goes well, we'll issue a coin.
Colonel, look at this.
The first open-heart surgery in medical history has just been done successfully.
- Bully.
- That should be my heart lying open there!
If it hadn't been for you, I'd be at a real hospital with research facilities instead of this roadside medical stand!
I hereby request a transfer.
Denied.
Next.
Colonel, if you don't get me out of here, I'll - You'll what?
- I'll find a way.
I will stop at nothing.
And you've been working on it already, haven't ya?
My every waking moment, with every breath I take, from the first time - That's it.
Get out!
- But, sir!
Get out or my name will be on your lips forever.
There's no reason to get huffy.
- I mean, there's nothing personal.
- Right, stranger.
Out.
- I just thought I'd ask.
- Out!
By the way, welcome back.
Thank you, sir.
And I'm just a corporal.
Don't you ever forget that.
Sir, this hand-delivered message was just delivered by hand.
- What is it?
- I don't know, sir.
- I never read your mail.
- What is it?
General Kent is warning you about a spot inspection.
Some big brass are coming in from "l" Corps.
Inspection, huh?
Those pencil pushers don't waste any time, do they?
- No, sir.
I'll notify the camp.
- No, you won't.
I'll fill them in in my own way when I'm good and ready.
In the meantime, don't breathe a word of this to anyone.
Capisce?
- Who, sir?
- Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Sir, is there anything I can do?
No.
Just keep your mouth shut.
Oh, yes, sir, I will.
I won't say a word.
Not a word.
Anybody asks me, I don't know nothin'.
Your secret is safe with me.
I can sure capisce that.
Mum's the word.
Hmm?
Oh, right.
Shh.
##  Honey chile, after the cotillion would you like to go down to the plantation for a game of slap and tickle?
Oh, good.
-  You will?
- Sure.
Why has it taken you a year?
- I like older men.
- I see.
Well.
Well.
Look at that brazen hussy over there and the woman he's with.
You're all lunatics.
- Ma'am, can I see your I.D.?
-  Don't be ridiculous.
I'm over 21.
Don't be ridiculous.
I know it.
##  Here it is.
That dumb white icing.
Don't tell me.
Please, don't tell me.
The Kentucky Derby.
Right.
And we used your hat size.
-  - ## Pierce, someday you'll be old enough to grow your own beard.
It's post time.
They're approaching the starting gate.
- Gather around the track.
- Just in time, Colonel.
- The two-dollar window's closing.
- Turn it off.
- But, sir.
- I said, turn that radio off.
-  - Let me have your attention.
Next Tuesday there's gonna be a surprise inspection.
The reason for this inspection my butt is on the block.
There have been bad reports about this unit floating around headquarters.
That's okay though.
Bad reports never bothered me.
They never will.
-  Right.
- Yeah.
I don't retreat from a fight.
They want efficiency, I'm gonna show 'em efficiency and pride everything they said we haven't got.
- That's right.
-  That report's gonna be so clean you can operate on it.
- Right.
- You betcha.
I'm gonna show 'em not only the best damn MASH unit in the army - but the best unit, period.
-  And right after that, I'm going home.
- Huh?
- What do you mean?
You heard me.
I'm leaving.
I'm putting in for a transfer.
I'm spending my last few months stateside.
That's all.
Good night.
The inspection's this Tuesday, so you fellas have gotta work fast.
Klinger, I want all torn canvas repaired on the tents.
I'll give it a nice zigzag stitch.
And 86 that M.P. Dodge.
Try masquerading as a soldier.
If you don't mind, sir, I'd like to keep my whistle.
Zale, Benson, I want this camp spotless.
If it don't move, paint it.
If it does move, pick it up.
- But, sir, my back.
- Is giving me a pain.
Dismissed.
You can't heap all this on us.
Benson, if your arms get to feeling too heavy, I can always take off those stripes.
Now scram!
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
All right.
We're waiting for an explanation.
Then wait outside.
I still don't want to talk about it.
There are a lot of people around here with their jaws scraping on the ground from that bombshell you dropped last night.
- You've got to talk about it.
- Got to?
Get out of here.
Who do you think you're talking to, strangers?
We want an explanation.
We're gonna stay until we get one.
I can call the M.P.s. They want an explanation too.
Look, let's stop the hostility festival and discuss it, okay?
Please?
We've been halfway through a war and back together.
You owe us that.
Those bad reports I mentioned last night have been coming from inside this camp.
- One of us?
- I try to make this bed of nails a little more comfortable and this is how I get paid off.
One of my own people stabs me in the back with a fountain pen.
A simple "thank you" would have sufficed.
- I can't believe it.
- Believe it.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna write to Mildred.
She might wanna know about this too.
Come in, Radar.
This is terrible.
Gee, he's such a wonderful commander.
Who'd be lousy enough to spy on a guy like that?
The floor is open for nominations.
Let's analyze this.
We're looking for somebody who's discontented - Yeah.
- Resentful and has a personal beef with the colonel.
- Who am I describing?
- Klinger?
No.
- Charles?
- Mmm.
Monogrammed toilet paper?
Who's he trying to impress?
"Ogilvy and Cabot's Hair Sprout.
A harvest of hair in every bottle".
Remind me to put this in his deodorant.
Here's his Ogilvy and Cabot stationery.
"Charles Emerson Winchester.
Boston, Paris, Palm Beach, Korea".
Anything interesting?
An unfinished letter.
I knew I was right about him.
- Aristocrats make the best sneaks.
- Read on, Macduff.
- "Dear Meredith" - That's a girl's name.
- Or maybe the last name of a general.
- I think you're stretching it.
"I'm afraid I have some very disturbing news to report".
I knew it.
"During that memorable rendezvous in Tokyo I told you that the only stars that sparkle for me were in your eyes.
In the interim I have discovered that the stars could and did sparkle for me without necessarily being in your eyes".
- Some spy letter.
- It's code.
It's a code.
"I truly regret giving you the impression a permanent relationship was possible.
I could never marry without the permission of Grandmama Winchester who possesses the wisdom of the ages and half of downtown Boston".
- Go on.
It's beginning to make sense.
- That's all there is.
I'll finish it, and then you can read the rest of it.
- Author, author.
- How shabby!
How unutterably shabby!
- Charles, listen - Oh, this is vulgar.
This is despicable.
Would you care to explain this to me?
- It's all there on the label.
- Why were you reading my mail?
- There's an explanation for this.
- Whatever it is, I don't believe it.
Someone has been sending secret reports to the inspector general about Colonel Potter.
- That's why he's packing it in.
- Someone's been insisting you were the informer.
- Some nut.
- And you chose to believe this provocateur?
- You can't call me that.
- I might have known.
There are no informers in my family.
Winchesters do not spy.
- We do on occasion hire them.
-  It was a dumb thing to do.
We apologize.
Oh, you stupid jerks!
It's come to this.
I just used the word "jerk".
- We're all slowing down.
- Gentlemen, I know that thinking unsettles your prejudices but if you would bother to use the few brains you have it might occur to you to look in the outgoing mail for a letter addressed to the inspector general.
The chances are very good it was written by the informer.
- Okay.
- One other thing, gentlemen.
Bear in mind that I still hate you.
- Do keep that in mind.
- Mm-hmm.
Charles, you're drinking your hair.
Don't be ridiculous.
This is 12-year-old scotch.
You don't think I'd leave this in the original bottle around you petty larcenists.
- Oh!
- What?
I've been drinking from his scotch bottle.
- Come on, sirs.
- Come on.
- We're not gonna steal anything.
- This is the U.S. Mail.
Only a U.S. Mailman can touch it once it goes in this bag.
- It's sacred.
- One of those bad reports on Colonel Potter could be in that sacred bag.
- Why didn't you say so?
- He's so stubborn.
This is the last time I ever take a post office job at Christmas.
Before I find it, what am I looking for?
Anything addressed to someplace official.
Here's one from Klinger to his draft board.
Is it ticking?
Here's one to "l" Corps, Inspector General.
It's okay.
It's from Joe.
- Who?
- Joe Benson.
He's a corpsman.
He's been here since June.
He's a regular guy.
It couldn't be him.
How many regular guys you know write home to "l" Corps?
Wait.
You're not gonna tear that open, are you?
Don't worry.
We're doctors.
I'll open, he'll close.
No, you better let me do it.
- Can you imagine what he could do with a scalpel?
- Mmm.
- That fink!
- You can use stronger language than that.
- That dirty fink!
- I don't get it.
Benson's just as undisciplined as the next guy.
- What's he got against Potter?
- Why don't we pin him to the ground cover him with ants and ask him nicely?
- I'll bring the boiling oil.
- Uh-oh.
-  - Uh-oh.
Choppers.
Business before pleasure.
- Close, Major.
- Good work, sir.
I've never seen that technique before.
- I thought you'd seen it all.
- It was done at the Mayo Clinic four months ago.
What did you do?
Visit there on a long weekend?
It was in some literature that came a while back.
I spent that long weekend reading it.
How about you, Quickdraw?
Well, I, uh, scanned it briefly.
Yeah, the light's not too good in the latrine.
I just don't know how we'll find anyone to replace you in here.
- I second that.
- Klinger.
- You call my name, and I appear.
- Get him to post-op.
- Benson, grab the other end.
- Oh, Benson, we'll need a hand in the changing room when we're done here.
- Would you stop by?
- Sure.
Anything you need.
- What a nice guy.
-  Salt of the earth.
Promise that you'll keep me away from that creep's throat.
I was gonna ask you to promise me.
- Now, what can I do for you sirs?
- Ah, Benson.
We've been waiting 10 minutes.
You're a little slow.
- I'm sorry, but - When an officer gives you an order, you better move.
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Gross inefficiency.
Better include yourself in your next report.
I can't see myself in those shoes.
Put that in too.
- I don't know what you are talking about.
- Yes, you do.
One of your letters fell into the right hands ours.
- Oh.
- Mmm.
There's a lot of activities I'm not gonna miss around here.
- That was one of them.
- Ah, Colonel, we got a little going-away present for you.
Sorry we didn't have time to gift wrap it.
I'm too pooped for puzzles.
What are you getting at?
May I present Corporal Joe Benson, snitch first class.
His fingerprints are all over that pen in your back.
- Benson, is this true?
- They make it sound worse than it is.
If I could raise my arms, I'd flatten your nose.
- What'd I ever do to you, Corporal?
- It's Lieutenant, sir.
- Ah, a commissioned weasel.
- Damn it, answer my question!
It was an assignment, sir.
I was sent by the inspector general to work undercover.
Why pick on us?
Our record was clean as a whistle till you got here.
Not according to Colonel Frank Webster of the Third Armor.
He was a patient here a couple of months ago.
Apparently he wasn't too thrilled with the quality of your care.
- I don't remember any Webster.
- Me neither.
I do.
Came through triage with a tiny piece of shrapnel in his tush and a big chip on his shoulder.
Got steamed when I told him he'd have to wait till the real casualties were treated.
You can't blame him.
A wound like that could've kept him off a bar stool for several days.
That still doesn't explain your negative reports.
Look, you gotta admit, from a military standpoint things are pretty loose around here.
Maybe.
From a human standpoint things are plenty tight.
I'd trade your shoeshines and snappy salutes for a good surgeon any day.
- Even if he looks like us.
- I wouldn't go that far.
- Well - All right, Benson.
Pack up your cloak and dagger and get out.
- Whatever you say, Colonel.
- Benson you tell Webster if he ever gets in my way again I'm gonna put that shrapnel back where I found it.
No, Waldo.
All I want is my record cleaned up.
Just get them to call off that surprise inspection.
We got enough to do around here without putting on our Sunday best for a bunch of dust-sniffing yahoos.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
What?
Am I staying?
I'll get back to you.
- Are you staying, Colonel?
- I must admit this is a load off my mind but I haven't seen Mildred in a long time.
- I haven't seen Peg, but I'm staying.
- It's been a long war.
I passed my prime about 10 squares back.
Look, Colonel, um Sherman you could give me and I can't give you one good reason to stay.
- Stay anyway.
- What he said.
Please?
Well, I'll have to think about it for a while.
- What the hell I'll stay.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- You'll regret every minute of it.
- I probably will.
- Uh-oh.
Choppers.
-  - Ooh, they sound loaded.
- Let's go.
I hate this place.
Colonel, can we see you in private?
- What's going on?
- We're getting up a surprise party.
- We wanted to know if you'd be the guest of honor.
- Hit it, Major.
- ##  - # For he's a jolly good fellow # #For he's a jolly good fellow # # For he's a jolly good fellow # #Which nobody can deny ##  Thank you, folks.
That was really lousy.
What do you expect with very little talent and only five minutes' preparation?
Okay, Denning!
Excuse me, sir.
Pardon me, Mrs. Potter.
- Right this way.
- Oh, that dumb white icing again!
- This is leftover derby.
- Half a hat is better than none.
- One candle.
What's that for?
- It's your first day back.
I want to apologize for being so surly.
You people are the best there is.
I should have realized that.
I'm sorry.
Aw.
Why don't you make a wish and blow it out, sir?
I'll make a wish for all of us.
Peace.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
# I've got you under your skin # # I've got me # # Deep in the heart of you ## Pierce, will you stop that detestable singing?
- Use some discretion in here.
- Okay.
#Another opening another show # Colonel Potter, will you make him stop?
- Or at least back him with an orchestra.
- All right.
Rein in your horses.
With this big push we can expect to see quite a lot of each other in the next few days.
Might as well stay on speaking terms.
Right.
# Everybody's hand in hand # # Bringin' down the pain ## - Shut up, Pierce!
- Thank you.
You've been a wonderful audience.
Suppose this is gonna be another one of those 24-hour shifts without a break.
Mm-hmm.
For starters.
- Nurse.
Retractor.
- What?
I said retractor.
Listen, will you?
Don't talk with your mouth open.
Kindly listen with yours closed.
Charles, are you just a tad edgy today?
Nope.
No.
Not in the least.
Stay awake, Charles.
You almost swallowed your mask.
-  I am awake.
- Come on, Major.
You look like a wrung-out dishrag, and I must say it doesn't surprise me.
You've gotta learn to pace yourself and get some rest.
You think that three cups of joe and a long shower can take the place of eight hours' shut-eye.
- You're running yourself ragged.
- Fortunately, I possess the Winchester stamina.
I'm fine.
Really.
-  Scissors.
- I can't.
I said scissors.
Major, the suture has slipped.
You didn't tie it correctly.
Oh.
# I tied for you # # Now it's your turn to tie over me ## Major, do you have the blood count results yet?
- Klinger, I'm going as fast as I can.
- Rats.
I walk all the way over from post-op for nothing.
That's 10 whole yards, Klinger - unless, of course, you took the scenic route through Manchuria.
- I'm pooped.
Hauling litters, stocking O.R. - Now I got K.P. Comin' up.
- Aw.
I'll probably fall asleep on the pudding and die of a concussion.
Don't even mention sleep.
Hey, Major, with all these pills and serums lyin' around you got anything that could juice me up a little?
You know, bring me back to the living?
Well, there is something.
May your harem never be stricken with stretch marks.
Klinger, these are amphetamines or dexies sometimes referred to as bennies by you Bohemians.
- I'm Lebanese.
- Right.
Ingesting two of these pills is like swallowing a 50-horsepower engine.
You'd be so alert your other four senses would catch up with your dainty nose.
Don't wrap 'em.
I'll eat 'em here.
These pills can make you feel so good you wouldn't even mind being in the army.
- Right!
Right!
- And I'm not gonna give you any.
- Right.
What?
- Do you want extreme depression?
- You want chronic fatigue?
- I already got those.
Worse, dependence on the drug itself?
Any drug like this must be dispensed by a qualified physician.
- Well, you've got a degree.
Come on.
- No, no.
Klinger, my expertise in the matter tells me that you cannot handle those.
- Why?
- Because people of your genetic background are far too hyperactive.
I am not!
See?
Oh, Klinger, thank God I was around to advise you.
No telling what would've happened without me.
All right.
I'll stick to sniffing garlic raw garlic.
Remember, Klinger before taking any medication like this always consult a highly trained physician like myself.
You're welcome.
Darn it!
Hey, Superman, huh?
Is that the one where they kidnap Lois Lane?
- Lois Lane gets kidnapped in every one.
- Yeah, I know.
- Hey, Remy, I'll trade ya.
- What do you got, Chalk?
The one where, uh, Popeye beats up all the Nazis.
Oh, yeah.
They take away all of Wimpy's hamburgers and he tells the Germans everything.
Why don't you guys ever read a book, learn somethin'?
- Like what?
- Catcher in the Rye.
And it ain't about baseball or booze.
Then, uh, what's so good about it?
I don't know yet.
No one's underlined it.
Can't be as good as Superman.
Hey, uh, you guys are, uh, marines, huh?
Yeah.
What gave it away, the solid muscles?
I tried to join the marines, but they said my eyes wasn't good enough for ya.
-  - You tried to join the marines?
You wouldn't last five seconds.
The D.I. Would use you for chewing tobacco.
-  - I would have made a good marine.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-  If we ever raid a kindergarten class, I'll call ya.
Here we are.
First floor.
Lingerie, sportswear elephant accessories and recuperating patients.
- Hey, Sarge.
- Sarge!
- Hey, you LODOs.
How ya doin'?
- Just terrific.
I hope you brought some raw meat.
- Hey, you guys'll be outta here by tomorrow night, won't you?
- No, no.
They're mandatory guests for the next few days.
- What's the Christmas rush?
- Our mouse goes up against the 4033rd tomorrow.
- Your mouse?
- Sluggo.
Hey, Doc, we gotta be there.
- Listen to it on the radio.
You got a racing rodent?
- Only the world's fastest.
Oh, yeah?
Doesn't the jockey get any credit?
Hey, listen.
Sluggo's 19-and-0.
Oh, yeah?
You guys got a mouse you think is pretty fast, huh?
- That's right, kid.
- Yeah, well, my mouse can beat your mouse.
Radar, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about the fastest mouse in Korea.
Yeah?
And how's his eyesight?
Hey, listen.
My Daisy can beat your Sluggo any day of the week and twice in January.
- Daisy?
- How about this Saturday, kid?
Okay.
Okay, my Daisy'll make your Sluggo into chewin' tobacca.
- Hey Hey, Radar, really?
- Really.
Uh, would you mind if we, uh if we bet on this extravaganza?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bet, bet, bet.
- Daisy has a pack to support.
Well, that's the idea, pal.
Bet as much as you can lose.
- Uh-huh.
Just put your money where your mouse is.
-  Radar, this, uh, Daisy is, uh, lightning fast, right?
Well, I guess I can teach her.
"Can anything compare to morning's first sight?
"The promise of beginning so new and so bright.
From the moment I awake, till my first cornflake, I tingle at Aurora's delight".
- Touching as hell.
- Who wrote that?
Charles Emerson Winchester while still an undergrad at Harvard.
It sounded very collegiate.
Still surviving only on coffee, Major?
No time for anything else.
Later this morning I intend to pull together my notes and finally write that article for the A.M.A. Journal entitled "Korea, the Surgeon's Buffet".
As long as it rhymes.
Either of you have a pen?
Thank you.
I tingle, for now I can write.
- Sending a card?
- My little sister Madge's birthday.
She'll cross the big 5-0 come Valentine's Day.
Well, that's four months away.
Yeah.
The way the mail moves around here I may be cutting it a little close.
Happy belated birthday.
Did I ever tell you about my little sister, Honoria?
She ran away from home  Ah, the pixie and, uh, married a farmer.
Can you believe it?
A farmer.
- A simple farmer.
- That's hilarious.
Later she left him.
The family ostracized her, of course.
She left him and went to live with not to marry, mind you but to live with Are you ready?
A shoe clerk.
- Friends, Romans and corpsmen, lend me your ears.
- He'll return them.
I promise.
'Tis nobler in the mind to suffer slings and arrows in order to make an outrageous fortune.
What the bard means is that we're taking action on Radar's rat race.
Our Daisy against the marines' Sluggo.
I come to bury Sluggo, not to praise him.
Now if you could only write like that, hmm?
What do you say, folks?
Golden opportunity.
What do you say?
What do ya say here?
- I'm in for five.
- Five.
We got five.
- Five.
- Me too.
I guess I can't spend it on dates.
Put me down for 20.
- Twenty.
Charles, bear in mind - Twenty.
Daisy is not on the New York Stock Exchange.
"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy".
Just lay down your cash.
I hate a guy who butchers Shakespeare.
$74.50.
- Who only bet 50 cents?
- Radar.
- That's encouraging.
- I hate to make a mountain out of mohair but when are you gonna fold your laundry?
- It's folded the army way.
- ##  Morning, Doc.
Where are the other six dwarfs?
That's amusing even from you.
Come on.
You can be more insulting than that.
Gentlemen, you see before you a brilliant, incisive paper for the A.M. A that a mere two hours ago was a blank pad of paper.
- What'll it be two hours from now?
- Would you proofread that for me?
- Sure.
Does spelling count?
- Hope there's some laughs in it.
Two hours?
There's 27 pages here.
- Yes, I pride myself on brevity.
- It's one long sentence.
- I'll read it later.
- Oh.
You know something, Charles?
It's taken you a long time, but I think you're finally beginning to fit into this place.
- Like a surgical glove.
- Are you surprised?
- No.
More like stunned, shocked.
- Bewitched, bothered and bewildered.
You are now coping with this nightmare better than I've ever seen you.
- Better than I've ever seen me.
- Don't forget, gentlemen, that I am a Winchester.
Write that down.
He's a Winchester.
All I have to do is set my mind to something, and eventually, inevitably, I conquer it.
You know, compared to the Harvard dorms, this place really isn't all that bad.
- Charles, don't change a hair.
- He hasn't got any to change.
Pity there isn't enough of the Winchester character to go around.
- Or the Winchester humility.
-   Attention all personnel.
The Chinese are at it again.
Incoming wounded.
Looks like a long one.
And we're the welcoming committee.
Those were the tiniest and neatest stitches I've ever seen, Major.
You're not assisting a blacksmith, Margaret.
These fingers could stitch a fly's wing back onto its body.
- But what fly could afford you?
- Done.
And in record time.
The fastest 40-yard colon ever run.
Klinger!
Klinger!
- Gotta move faster than that.
- Sorry, sir.
I was in the back giving my biceps a pep talk.
You're holding up progress.
I wanna see X rays.
Right away, Major.
Klinger, you've built a reputation you can't live up to.
Don't worry.
We'll have you out of here in a jiffy even quicker.
I have some time free if anyone needs some help.
Margaret, would you please chain him to his table?
Even if I could catch him, what chain could hold him?
- Oh, missed a piece of shrapnel there, Pierce.
- Colonel.
Major, why don't you take a break?
You've earned one.
Yeah, Charles.
You've got a few seconds to unwind.
Why don't you reread War and Peace?
Building a four-lane highway can be relaxing.
This is funny.
You people can't keep up, and it burns you.
You're choking on my dust.
I got whiplash just watching you go back and forth.
- Klinger, where are those X rays?
- Here they are, Major.
A little late, a little dark, and a little out of focus.
No problem.
These eyes can make out every detail.
I can't wait to see him leap tall buildings in a single bound.
- Daisy, you're looking great.
-  Oh, that's terrific.
Listen, I can't give you any water now 'cause you know when you're in training it'll give you cramps.
Maybe I'll give you some after your rubdown.
- Now there's a picture for the game program.
- A boy and his mouse.
Beautiful.
She's ready, sir.
This morning she ran the garbage dump in 15 seconds flat.
That's her home field.
How will she perform in front of a hostile crowd?
I wanna beat those marines so bad.
Then I can really rub it in.
If the Flash should win, the safest thing for us would be to take our winnings and sneak away like little mice.
You know marines, Radar.
They love to land on things.
- They don't scare me.
- Look, a short Bronx cheer will do nicely.
Come on, Coach.
Let's put Daisy through her paces.
- She could run some wind sprints.
-  Great.
I'll put a piece of cheese behind the, uh - Behind the what?
- I don't wanna say it in front of her.
Wanna hold her?
- No!
Keep her away.
I don't like mice.
- She's just a rodent.
I don't like mice.
I'm not prejudiced.
I just prefer them behind walls.
You must have handled them in premed.
I wouldn't even see one on a consultation.
Get - Nice, Daisy.
Down, big fella.
- Don't let her see where I put this.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- On your mark -   Oh, look at that!
Oh!
- Oh!
She runs like a deer.
- Fantastic!
- Radar, she's inspiring.
- We're gonna clean up!
Maybe we oughta give ourselves a bigger edge.
You know?
Get her little track shoes.
- Daisy?
Come on, Daisy.
- Daisy.
- Daisy, I know you're thirsty.
- Daisy!
- Daisy.
Ooh!
- Find her quick before the cook does.
- Where could she be?
-  - Ooh!
- Found.
One Daisy.
Don't trip on her!
A walk.
Take a walk.
What?
What?
Who's there?
What is it?
What is it?
It's Charles again.
The creature that stalks the night.
Winchester, the only people up in Korea at this hour are snipers and milkmen.
Please!
Lie down and get some rest.
Pierce, if I could sleep I would, but I can't, so I'm not.
Charles, what can we do to help?
Can we sing you a lullaby?
Bring you some warm milk?
Read to you from the social register?
What?
- Not funny, Pierce.
- How about a sleeping pill?
I think you could use one.
You think?
How dare you presume to prescribe for me.
Leave me alone, both of you.
- You just won't admit it, will ya?
- Admit what?
That you're not Superman, Dr. Pasteur and Al Jolson all rolled into one.
- Nobody could survive the pace you've set for yourself.
- I'll be the judge of that.
Thar she blows the Winchester Pride.
Which will see me through this crisis or any other.
You know what you've done, don't ya?
You've convinced yourself you can outperform everybody in this camp without breaking down.
Well, as a veteran of sleepless nights, irregularity and no appetite I can promise you it won't work.
I know it's hard to take, but you're just like the rest of us.
Bite your tongue, Hunnicutt.
I'm going to the Nurses' Tent.
At least there I got a reason to stay up.
All right.
All right.
If I lie here quietly, will you two night crawlers cease and desist?
We promise.
You won't hear another sound.
Good.
- You want another pillow?
- No.
- Good night, B.J. - Good night, Hawkeye.
-  Good night, Charles.
- You promised.
Half hour to post time, Daisy.
I taught you everything I know.
Now it's up to you.
I just hope you're not as nervous as I am.
- How's she doing, Radar?
- Oh.
All right, I hope.
I have a lot of money on her.
- Sir, I wish you wouldn't say that in front of her.
- Why?
Is anything wrong?
No.
It's just that when she climbs the walls like that she's not really right.
I think she's startin' to feel the pressure.
I see.
Corporal, uh, be a good fellow, run into the Swamp and fetch my opera glasses, will you?
- Opera glasses?
- Yes, to watch the race.
I can't guarantee my vantage point.
Your vantage what?
Shoo.
Feeling a little sluggish, eh?
Well, this, my dear Daisy will perk you right up.
-  -  How we doin'on the bucks?
- Sergeant.
- You see, Klinger?
Are you still, uh, giving I'm, uh, having trouble gettin' action on that.
You got any loose change?
- About, uh, 50 bucks.
- Take it.
Take it before he wants to buy the Brooklyn Bridge with it.
An officer born every minute.
Any other takers?
Right here.
Twenty dollars on Daisy.
Twenty bucks?
You must be crazy, Father.
Klinger, for 10-to-1, I'd bet against Notre Dame.
-  -  That's a pretty scrawny looking mouse.
- Says you!
- She's a little on the thin side, but she's quick.
Quick.
We'll see.
Sluggo's ready.
- So's Daisy.
- Then let's start 'em.
Ooh.
I'm all goose-pimply.
Hey, Daisy, take it easy.
Don't wear yourself out before the race.
- She probably bet on herself.
- Hey, let me let me pet her for good luck.
- You sure, sir?
- Yeah.
-  -  Yuck!
Hey, Daisy.
Take it easy, honey.
All right.
On your mark, get set Come on, Daisy.
Go!
Radar, I don't know what you did, but she's amazing!
-  It's Mighty Mouse!
-  Daisy, is that you?
- Go, go, go, go!
-  - Come on, Daisy.
-  Come on!
Come on, Daisy.
Come on, Daisy.
She stopped!
-  -  She's running the wrong way!
Just like the army.
It's always retreatin'.
Turn around, Daisy.
Turn around.
No, now she's okay.
She's okay now.
Daisy.
Daisy.
-  Look what she's doin'.
-  Daisy, Daisy.
There's the cheese!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
This is just the beginning.
We'll build a mouse farm in Kentucky.
- Begin a whole new breed.
-  Daisy, take it easy.
I'm gonna knit that mouse the cutest little winner's wreath you ever saw.
Come on.
Let's go over to Rosie's to toast the winners and console the losers.
First round is on the parish.
- Sure.
I'm goin'with you, Father.
- Wonderful, Radar.
- Yes, that was good.
- You know, that's uh that's some mouse you got there.
If we had any money left, we'd make you an offer for her.
No, no, Daisy's not racin' anymore.
Th-Th-The tension makes her crazy.
- I-I'm gonna take her back and put her in her hutch.
- Hey, Radar.
You and your mouse are okay.
Thanks.
I think Radar just won a spot in the Montezuma Hall of Fame.
- Shall we join the others?
- Yeah.
We're already a round behind.
- We'll have one on you, fellas.
- So long, fellas.
- Hey.
-  - Charles, what's the matter?
You won.
- I know.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
- I don't like this.
- His color is awful.
I know.
I'm usually such a happy person.
- Full of fun.
- It's running like a train.
- Let's get him to the Swamp.
- Come on.
- I feel so bad.
- Okay.
Take it easy.
- I This started out to be such a wonderful evening.
- Hmm.
Yeah.
Look at him.
Like a whirling dervish.
Why would his pressure be - This is not just from long hours and fatigue.
- Maybe he took some help.
Charles taking drugs.
Well, I'll be leaving Korea now.
I've seen it all.
With his ego, he probably figured he could handle it.
Yeah, but who handled who?
You know, whatever it is, it's probably in that footlocker.
Say something nice about me in the search warrant.
- It's locked.
- No problem.
- I've been using Charles's talcum powder.
-  It keeps away the flies.
- What a mess.
- Now I know there's something wrong.
It's probably at the bottom.
Huh?
What are you doing?
- Don't worry about it, Charles.
Just a spot inspection.
- Give me that.
Amphetamines, huh?
When did you start taking those?
None of your business.
I'm gonna report this invasion of privacy.
Really?
You gonna say we stole your dope?
Look, gentlemen, I was feeling run down and those helped to pick me up.
I'm administering them myself.
I know what I'm doing.
Oh, do ya?
Do you really?
Let me tell you something, Doctor.
The patient you placed under your care is falling to pieces.
- Nonsense.
It's ridiculous.
- Charles.
Take a look at yourself.
Look what your little pick-me-up has done for you.
Your blood pressure's way up.
Your heart's palpitating.
Your hands are shaking all signs of a man falling apart.
I knew I couldn't  - Excuse me, sirs.
- Not now, Radar.
We're busy.
Uh, sir, this is an emergency.
It's Daisy.
Uh, I can't calm her down after the race.
She keeps runnin' round and round and round in her cage and, uh, first she shadowboxes, and then she tap-dances.
Then it's like she's tryin' to play the drums or somethin'.
Sounds like Daisy was visiting your footlocker too.
She'll calm down.
I gave her a mouse's portion.
- What's he mean?
- He means he gave Daisy pep pills.
You drugged my Daisy, sir?
- How could you do that?
- She was in no danger.
Hey, listen.
Don't you tell me that.
I raised her from a pup.
I mean, I know you're a sir, sir, but i if you ever touch my animals again, uh I'll have somethin' to say about it!
And it won't be from Corporal to Major either.
It'll be man to man!
Boy!
- I'm sorry.
- I hope the marines don't find out about this.
I think we better give the marines their money back while we're still alive.
- What do you say, Charles?
- Yes, of course.
Here.
Keep the change.
I don't know how this happened, gentlemen.
I've never been so ashamed in my life.
- If you will excuse me.
- Where you going?
Throw up.
- Do you realize we got a whole day off?
- Mmm.
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna take a nap.
- Mm-hmm.
- And then later, when I wake up - I'll turn over and get some sleep.
-  Look at him.
Look, look.
He hasn't talked to anyone in three days.
Well, at least he's eating.
- I'm worried about him.
I think he's takin' this kind of hard.
- Yeah.
A dose of reassurance wouldn't hurt.
- Let me.
- Uh-huh.
Morning, Charles.
Listen, I want you to know we're all behind you.
What happened to you could've happened to any of us.
There's no reason to feel bad, you know, because we're Pierce, will you save the consolation speech for someone who needs it?
Yourself pops into mind or anyone else in this canvas asylum.
For the first time in months I have found an appetite and any banal conversation is bound to make me lose it.
So, uh, if you will excuse you.
Uh-huh.
- Well?
- He's mean, obnoxious, pompous, egotistical - In other words, fine.
- Right.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Them bones, them thigh bones, them hip bones, them knee bones.
I haven't seen so many broken bones since the Army-Navy game of'24.
-  What schools played in that game?
- I don't know.
I had lousy seats.
These marines may be great fighters, but they're lousy drivers.
It isn't easy for a troop truck to make a U-turn after it's gone over a cliff.
Actually, these boys are quite lucky.
They're missing all the horrors of war.
Not so lucky.
They'd been there.
They were on their way back.
This guy landed right on his chest.
He's got fractured ribs, a lacerated lung.
I'll have to do a lobectomy.
If there's too much of a problem, Hunnicutt, I can take it.
There's a fractured femur here for you.
Thanks all the same, Charles, but I've done at least 50 of these.
Oh, really?
That's almost half as many as I've done.
I beg your pardon, rookie, but in what war?
The big one the war of the Boston commuters.
The contingency does not exist for which I am not prepared.
You name it.
I've done it successfully.
Oh, yeah?
Have you ever done a mesenteric arterial thrombosis?
Before or after medical school?
Dr. Winchester leads, one to nothing.
Oh, yeah?
How about an abdominal aortic aneurysm?
- Yes, but it was very difficult.
- Oh, you actually admit that.
Yes, of course I do.
It was during a power blackout.
The snow's getting pretty thick in here.
How many in this room can say they have performed a porta caval shunt?
- I can do a cartwheel.
- During an appendectomy.
- I thought so.
- Game, set and match to Major Winchester.
He hasn't won anything.
We're just as good as he is.
Now, the hip bone is connected to the neck bone.
No, no, it's connected to the thigh bone No, no, wait a minute.
This serving ain't a bad gig, Miller.
Once you lose your sense of smell, you got it licked.
I'll handle the spuds.
You dish out the stew.
- Here's your ladle.
- Oh, thank you.
It's very nice.
- Is it plugged in?
- I beg your pardon?
Testing, testing.
One, two, three, test.
Works fine.
Very funny.
Lunchtime, folks!
Grab your platter and watch it splatter.
- Have some stew, Colonel?
- What kind is it?
Could be beef, pork or water buffalo.
We'll never know, and it won't tell.
Well, as long as it's dead.
Spoon it on, son.
No toast.
One brown puddle.
Hold the shingle.
Uh, I think I'll have some of that too.
I wouldn't, Rabbi.
It may not be kosher.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm not orthodox.
I don't know what you're pulling here, Miller but work the other side of the street.
-  How about this one?
- What?
Beer Belly Gus broke his own record.
That's unbelievable.
What's a Beer Belly Gus?
Just the biggest brew guzzler in the west.
It says right here he just chug-a-lugged a whole half keg at the Petaluma Lumberjack Festival.
That's as easy as falling off a log.
Let me tell you about Skowhegan Seth, our old Maine fishing guide.
He once fell in a seven-foot brewer's vat.
He would've drowned ifhe hadn't drunk his way down to five feet.
Imagine if he had pretzels with him.
Gentlemen, your tall tales are mildly amusing.
Care to hear a short true one?
Gather around the campfire, partners.
Old Gabby Winchester is about to open a crock of Boston-baked bull.
- You boys never give up, do you?
- My story can be verified.
I have my Bible if you'd like to swear on it.
Perhaps later.
Paddy O'Gorman, our former handyman was a prodigious drinker.
At my sister's wedding, when it came time to toast the happy couple there was not a bottle of champagne to be found.
We looked down the aisle, and there was Paddy belching from the bubbly setting up all his empties for his own private bowling tournament.
He got you.
I don't even have to hear yours.
I don't swallow that for a second.
Boots Miller on the move here in Korea, where the men are rugged.
You can see it in their voices.
I'm about to interview one of these brave and courageous young soldiers.
What's your name, soldier, and what do you do?
My name is Colonel Potter, soldier, and I bust wiseacres like you.
These Brooklyn boys have a language all their own.
How about you, trooper?
- Please.
I have ladle fright.
- Hi, Mom.
- Klinger, you in charge of this man?
- Miller, gimme that.
Please!
We're on the air.
- Klinger, protege of yours?
- What do you think, I'm crazy?
Listen, this place ain't big enough for two psychos.
Come on.
Aha!
Here's a young lad with the peach fuzz still fresh on his cheeks.
- How old are you, sonny?
- Sonny?
What's going on here?
- Now, now, don't be nervous.
- Why is this man talking into a spoon?
- They're out of forks.
- Just stay away from me.
Isn't one of you enough?
- Major!
- And now let's pause for a musical salute for these brave young soldiers.
It's Rosemary Clooney and "Come On-a My House".
Klinger, you better keep an eye on Rosemary Loony.
-  - Kellye, come here.
- It's a lot of pain here.
Where's that damn morphine?
- Radar's breaking out a new box.
Tell him to step on it.
This kid's in a lotta pain.
- When it gets here, set up an eight milligram IV.
- Yes, sir.
Psst!
Sirs?
Uh, listen, sirs, this is the last box.
- One lousy box and that's it?
- Stuff's so popular, we can't keep it on the shelves.
If that supply truck doesn't get here by 1800 hours - we're gonna have to wait till tomorrow.
- What time is it now?
- 1830.
- Well, this should keep us going through the night okay.
-  Doctors, quick!
-  He's burning up.
Could be a pyrogenic reaction.
Maybe the morphine's contaminated.
- Or he's got a raging infection of some kind.
- He looks bad.
Think we got him in time.
Kellye, alcohol rubdown.
Keep him cool and set up a penicillin IV.
- Till we find out what this is.
- Yes, sir.
- What happened?
- We're not sure.
This kid had a peculiar reaction to the morphine.
- You're sure it's morphine?
- That's the first thing I checked.
We've either got contaminated morphine or an acute infection.
Eighty-six this stuff.
Break out another box.
- Yeah, well - Something wrong?
Can we talk in the lobby?
- All right, what?
- That's the last of the morphine until tomorrow.
Oh, dandy.
Just once I'd like to see supply get here ahead of demand.
You'd think they'd give preference to their steady customers.
Radar, tell those paperweights in Seoul we may have a bad batch.
- I'll tell them we need more.
- Get more here extra pronto.
It's gonna be a long night.
## Hold it right there, soldier!
I'm from Movietone News, and I want to get your picture.
Now just act natural, stay in the light.
Come off it, Miller.
Who you kidding?
You can't take a picture with a microphone.
No profile shots, please.
I don't have a wide-angle lens.
Okay, that does it!
Sit down.
It's time we had a little nut-to-nut talk.
Take it from an old pro.
You might get an "A" in perseverance, but that's it.
This microphone bit is strictly for sandlot psychos.
This is the big league, guy.
Up here it takes seasoning, finesse.
So from now on, you just shut up, put down your spoon and watch me.
- Okay.
- Good.
I don't want to have to tell you again.
- You won't.
- All right.
Now let's get some sleep.
We got guard duty in two hours.
- Good night, Miller.
- Good night, Klinger.
Good night, Mr. Shoe.
Huh?
How could I forget?
Good night, Mr. Sock.
And don't you worry about this little hole.
Mr. Toe doesn't mind a bit.
Night.
Night.
Whoo!
Folks, we've got a real lulu on our hands.
Littered with wounded sitting on what could be a rotten shipment of morphine.
- What about Seoul?
- Can't ship till tomorrow.
So the $64 question is, "What do we do in the meantime"?
And for the grand prize, what do they do in the meantime?
Why are we condemning an entire shipment of morphine because of one man's negative reaction?
Because that one man almost died.
Would you care to try for two out of three?
Charles, in all my experience as a doctor, I have never seen a reaction that bad.
In all my experience as a doctor and almost head of thoracic surgery at Massachusetts General - There he goes again.
- I have never heard such a hasty and unsubstantiated conclusion.
Colonel, he's right.
Let's try it on a second man.
- Roll up your sleeve, Charles.
- I loathe you, Pierce.
I call your loathe and raise you two despises.
Well, we've got to do something.
Icing the wounds is not gonna be enough.
- I prescribe the morphine.
- Sure.
It's quick, effective, possibly lethal.
- We're not really loaded with options, are we?
- Pierce, close that door.
Now what I've got to tell you has to be kept within the confines of this room.
- I mean it.
- Go ahead.
Back in Hannibal, MO, when I was about eight years old we lived across the street from old Doc Schumacher.
Of course you did.
Simple country doctor.
A lot of horse sense.
One night my Aunt Grace was visiting came down with a terrible migraine.
Poor woman was in agony.
When we called Dr. Schumacher he said he'd come over and see what he could do.
- All this is top secret?
- No.
Let me finish.
Anyway, he shows up with something that he said would really do the trick.
Gave her a couple of pills, told her not to worry she was gonna be fine, completely cured.
Sure enough, in about a half an hour, she was up baking me cookies.
- What did he give her?
- Two sugar pills.
A placebo?
He gave her a phony cure?
Nothing phony about her recovery.
Look, I'm happy for Aunt Grace, but we're talkin' about compound fractures.
And we're a long way from Hannibal, MO.
The body can do remarkable things if the mind will let it.
Now, if we sell it, really sell it it just might work.
- But they're still sugar pills.
- Not if they believe it's morphine.
Next thing you know, we'll be sticking pins in little dolls.
- Spoken like a true shrunken head.
- I say it's worth a try.
Well, if we don't give them something, they're gonna be in a bad way.
I, for one, refuse to take part in this ridiculous charade.
Charles, we're all in this together.
And if you breathe one word of this out there I promise you a pain nothing will cure.
We need absolute security.
Anything negative will kill it.
Pierce, Hunnicutt, why don't you go to the pharmacy and make up about fifty little white lies.
The rest of us will be waiting in post-op.
- I hope I can be convincing.
- It's easy, Margaret.
Just pretend you're in the high school play.
You're Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm passing out morphine.
This isn't gonna work.
This is not gonna work.
It won't wo Well, I hope I'm wrong.
Glassberg, you know you're not allowed to read that book without a prescription.
What do you want, sirs?
I'm busy underlining.
- We need the room.
- Why?
You got some girls?
It's kinda small in here.
- We're taking a spot inventory.
- At 1:00 in the morning?
Orders from Tokyo.
One of our tongue depressors is missing.
Get out.
- But leave the book.
- Not a chance.
Just don't make a mess, okay?
One or two small explosions.
That's it.
This is all the powdered sugar I could scrape off the donuts.
- Where are the capsules?
- Look under K, here they are.
I wish Aunt Grace were here to test these out.
- What's that for?
- For luck.
We're not finished yet.
Go read Fanny Hill.
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, Father!
Fanny Hill a, um, famous nurse.
Yeah, she was a great comfort to the boys during World War I. If you say so.
Colonel Potter told me what you were doing.
- I came by to see if I could help.
- Grab a capsule and dig in.
These will cure aches, pains and bitter coffee.
Father, this is right up your alley.
Those boys will be taking these pills on faith.
Ah, yes, faith the evidence of things unseen.
Looks like I've finally got you fellas working with me.
Halt!
Who goes there?
It's me Klinger.
Relax.
I'm here to relieve you.
Advance, Klinger, and be recognized!
Come on.
You know who I am.
You took enough film of me.
- Shh!
You hear that?
- Hear what?
Enemy planes overhead.
Twelve o'clock high.
- I don't hear anything.
- Of course not.
They're gliders.
Oh, and they're gonna drop bombs on us, right?
That's a lot you know.
That's enemy reconnaissance.
They've been overhead for over two hours, watching our every move.
Hit the dirt!
- I got I got two of 'em!
- Give me that rifle, damn it!
Uh, it's all right, folks.
It's just a little backfire.
We're safe now.
I chased 'em all off.
It's okay.
Just a backfire.
Why'd you do that?
Even I wouldn't do that.
You could've gotten us killed.
You are nuts.
If they gave me a Section Eight tonight, I'd give it to you.
I don't want a Section Eight.
I want to serve my country.
Now I know you're crackers.
Get out of here, Miller.
Go on!
Go on back to your tent and sit up with Mr. Shoes and Mr. Socks.
I forgot.
Gee, I hope they're all right.
Come on, guys.
Let's go back to the tent.
Only thing I don't understand is why he's not an officer.
We about ready?
- All right, kids.
It's show time.
- Wait a minute.
I'm not one to harp on things, but this is all up to us.
Here's the formula: If we believe it, they believe it.
If we can make it work in their minds it just might work in their bodies.
Otherwise, they're only taking sugar pills.
Colonel, they are only taking sugar pills.
- However, I am a consummate actor.
- You better be.
I am.
I am, Margaret.
I was in the Hasty Pudding shows at Harvard.
Two years.
I have my reviews if Okay, Collins, I got your medication here.
- Thanks, Doc.
- This is a very, very strong painkiller.
- And it'll really put me out?
- You're gonna be asleep in a few minutes.
- You sure one's enough?
- These are very potent.
One's more than enough.
How long till this takes effect, Doc?
Oh, well, see, there are a number of variable factors involved your metabolism, rate of ingestion Ten minutes, soldier.
Yeah, ten minutes, give or take a minute.
What's in it, Father?
Morphine?
No, it's it's better.
Rifkin, put it on the back of your tongue and chase it down with a little water.
I can't swallow pills, Doc.
I choke on Sen-Sen.
You're like my horse.
I have to hide her pill in an old apple core.
All right.
Open your mouth, close your eyes.
Do it.
You'll be out of pain soon.
I wish I could say the same.
You just bit my finger.
- Given up so soon, Major?
- Father, it isn't working.
Knowing that, it is very difficult for me to sit in there and smile.
- It's only been a few minutes.
- If it hasn't taken effect by now, it never will.
Oh, ye of little faith.
Father, I am a man of medicine, not a medicine man.
Sirs, I think you better come quick.
You're gonna wanna see this.
See?
Told you.
- Doc, I'm still in pain.
- Give it time.
You just took the pill.
- The pill isn't working.
- It takes a little longer with some people.
- I can tell, my - Okay, I'll give you one more, but that's it.
- These things are just too strong.
- Thanks, Doc.
- Could you hurry?
- Kellye?
You're really beginning to feel it, aren't ya, son?
Yeah.
The arm stopped throbbing.
It's gonna feel even better.
Now get some sleep.
Almost half.
Not too bad.
Maybe next time we ought to put in more sugar.
Gentlemen, I would say that as placebos go, our results were remarkable.
Between the placebos, the sleeping pills and the ice packs they should make it through the night.
Old Doc Schumacher would've been proud.
- Yeah, I wanna thank you boys for coming through on this.
- All for a good cause.
I know it was my idea, but I got to admit it was the damnedest thing I ever saw.
It's just not fair, you know.
I spent all those years in medical school, and these guys wind up helping themselves.
The best doctor is right up here.
Don't spread it around.
We'll be out of jobs.
- It was just amazing.
- Obviously to a Maine boy, it would be.
- And you've witnessed better?
- Of course I have.
Massachusetts General, '47.
Appendectomy.
No anesthesia.
I know.
Your handyman inhaled it all.
Dr. Babcock put the patient under by hypnotizing him with his gold watch.
And when he woke up his appendix, the watch and the doctor were gone.
Jest if you like.
It's all there in the Massachusetts medical record.
Now I have a reason to go home.
I want to look that up.
It wouldn't help you a bit, Pierce.
It doesn't have pictures.
- I'm gonna get that guy.
- I hate to top you, but I'm gonna get that guy.
- Would you settle for we're gonna get that guy?
- Come on, little boys.
You've had a busy day.
I'm sick and tired of Charles topping us every time we open our mouths.
Yeah, he does do his best to humiliate you, but that's part of his charm.
- Care to join us under the big top?
- We're gonna work him over.
- Nah.
I'll read about it in the court-martial.
- Ah.
- Sir, I've got to talk to you.
- Not now, Klinger.
I'm due at a 40-wink festival.
But it's about Miller.
You told me to keep an eye on him.
What is it?
Is he wearing your dresses?
No, he's past that, sir.
He talks to his socks.
As long as he keeps them clean.
Colonel, during guard duty, he shot down imaginary enemy gliders with not so imaginary bullets.
Klinger, I'd like to do my dreaming in bed.
Colonel, it's the truth.
Right now he's in the field interrogating the glider pilots.
And you're upset 'cause you didn't think of it first.
I'm telling you.
The guy is loony tunes.
And th-th-that's all, folks!
I got it.
You're working with him.
Well, the two of you together don't add up to a Section Four.
Good night!
Take it from me.
The guy's Freddy from the funny farm, wraparound jacket and all.
Hup, hup, hup!
Prisoners, halt!
All right, you two, move over there!
- Keep your hands in sight, move slow and no talking!
- May I present a lunatic?
Colonel, is there a place we can keep these dangerous prisoners?
In the rubber room.
Corporal, put the gun down.
You're giving me the shakes.
Sir, that's ridiculous.
I got two dangerous prisoners here.
If I put this gun down, they'll disappear in a minute.
Miller, let's talk about this.
Hand Klinger the rifle.
He'll watch the prisoners.
You just show me where they are.
Okay.
Halt!
Oh, no!
They got another glider.
They're taking off!
Halt!
Halt!
When he runs out of ammunition, bulldog him.
I'll be in my office doing the paperwork to get him out of here.
Colonel, as long as you're filling out one Section Eight form - what would it hurt to do another?
-  Hey, Beej, did I ever tell you about Lenore Clement voted Miss New England of 1949?
- No.
Did you know her?
- Are you kidding?
I knew her when she was Miss Maine of'48 - even Miss Crabapple Cove of'47.
- Really?
I painted her swimsuit on her.
Oh, funny you should mention swimsuits.
- Once in Hollywood, I dated Esther Williams's stand-in.
- Really?
I could kiss her for an hour at a time she could hold her breath so long.
Tell me, was she, uh, beautiful?
Gorgeous!
From her head to her gills.
Ever heard of Audrey Hepburn?
Sure.
Big brown eyes.
Beautiful smile.
Lot of talent.
I understand she can act too.
And you dated her stand-in, right?
'Course not.
I dated her.
- Oh, come on!
- That's it!
We're callin' you on this one, Charles.
Look, Charles, we've had enough of your lies.
Your handyman?
Okay.
- The hypnotist?
Maybe.
- Maybe.
- But Audrey Hepburn?
- It's just a laugh.
Never!
I've seen her, and not only couldn't you date her she wouldn't let you into a theater where one of her movies was playing.
Actually, I've never seen any of her films.
-  Ah, really?
- I just had dinner with her.
Don't you ever give up?
Face it, Mother Goose, we got you this time.
Quasimodo would have a better chance of dating Audrey Hepburn than you.
- Gentlemen - Oh, look at this.
I I hate to do this.
You - What is it?
Let me see.
- Nothing, nothing.
It's just a picture of Audrey Hepburn having dinner with I can't say it Charles.
It's a fake.
- It's not a fake!
- I'm gonna be sick.
A charming little girl.
Lovely old world manners.
Appetite of a bird.
I guess that shows you.
When will you two cretins realize that your feeble imaginations cannot keep up with my real life?
- Oh, yeah?
- Brilliant riposte, Pierce.
- Oh, yeah?
- Come on, Hawk, come on.
Next he'll be tellin' us how he climbed Mount Everest.
You know, it's very strange you should mention climbing.
- He went up Everest.
- Well, not yet, no.
The Matterhorn in winter.
It's more sporting that way.
- Oh, that's it, that's it.
- Uncle.
I'll never forget the morning we set out.
Eighty mile an hour winds.
Lars, our guide, immediately doubled his fee.
I fired him, of course.
Got a package for you, Colonel, from the Novelite Toy Company.
Mildred probably sent something cute for the horse.
- A whoopee saddle?
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- Oh, it's a sock with a face on it.
- Anyone we know?
- Well, here's a letter.
-  Hi, my name is Stinky.
- It's from Boots Miller.
- Get away from me, you creep.
"Dear Colonel Potter.
Meet Mr. Sock.
"He was invented in your very own camp.
Invented?
Boots was a fake.
- "And in the last two months, we've sold over 50,000 of them.
- A rich fake.
"I'm now vice-president in charge of research and development - "of the Novelite Toy Company.
- How do you like that guy?
He even fooled me.
"I wrote to thank you and at the same time to ask for your help.
- "I have an idea for a new toy called Enemy Glider.
- Oh, no.
"I've been able to reproduce the pilot perfectly "but did not get a good look at the glider itself.
Did you by chance take any photographs of the one that I shot down"?
