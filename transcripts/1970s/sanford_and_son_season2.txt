{START OF EPISODE 1}
No one to walk with All by myself No one to talk with but I'm happy on the shelf Ain't misbehavin' Savin'my love For you, for you For you I'm all but certain it's you that - Hi, Pop.
- Hi, son.
I set a nice table, don't I?
Me and Julia Child.
Ain't misbehavin' Mashed potato For you, for you Hey, Pop.
Say, what are you so happy about this morning?
I know something that you don't know, and it's making me happy.
Oh, yeah?
Well, what is it?
Guess.
Something that would make me really happy.
Lena Horne's gonna move in with us.
Don't tell no jokes about Lena.
You know how I feel about her.
You can talk about anybody else, but don't mess with the Horne.
Now be serious.
Something that would really make me happy.
Guess.
Something that would make you happy.
President Nixon's not gonna run.
If he comes through Watts, he will.
Look, I mean Oh, well, you ain't gonna never get it.
So I'll just tell you.
You ready?
I got it.
I woke up with it this morning.
Is it contagious?
No.
You know what I mean.
I got the number for today.
Oh, Pop, don't tell me you're doing that again.
And don't be spreadin' it around.
I don't want nobody else playing it.
I thought you were through with that.
You haven't played in over a year.
I ain't had one of my special dreams in over a year.
Oh, you had another special dream.
Yeah.
See, I was dreamin' that I was ridin' a train.
All night long Kansas City, Omaha, Denver, China.
China?
How'd you get to China on a train?
I told you it was one of my special dreams.
- I don't wanna hear any more.
- Wait a minute.
You and your special dreams.
I've heard about 'em for 18 years.
Let me finish telling you about what happened in the dream.
I had this big suitcase bulging with money.
Was it that beat-up bag of yours with the rope?
Nope.
It was a brand-new vinyl job with a chrome handle.
Then that explains it.
You picked up the wrong suitcase.
Let me explain the dream.
I looked it up in Lucky Lucille's Dream Book.
See here?
Wait a minute.
I'll find it here.
I was reading it this morning.
Oh, here it is.
See what it says?
"Riding on a bus or a train.
Number 219.
If you dream you are riding on a bus or a train it means good fortune will smile on you this day.
" Just because Lucky Lucille's Dream Book says the number for riding on a bus or train is number 219, you're betting on it.
That's not the only reason.
Guess what number the bus was I was ridin' on.
- What?
- Twelve.
Now add up the numbers in 219.
- Two and one is three.
- And nine?
- Twelve.
- Don't that give you goose pimples?
No, it gives me a pain.
I don't wanna hear about these numbers.
- I want you to forget about 'em.
- Forget?
It's money in the bank.
Pop, do you know what the odds are at winning at the numbers?
Yeah.
Six hundred to one.
If you bet ten bucks, you win $6,000.
Six thousand dollars!
We could pay off the mortgage and all this would be ours.
I'd rather have the $10.
If you just bet five bucks, you get $3,000.
We could get a new truck, a dishwasher, a television for the bedroom and have some money left over to go to Chinatown.
Forget it.
- What about three bucks?
- No.
- Two?
- I said no.
How about a buck?
What if I find nine other guys to chip in a dime apiece?
Listen.
I'm telling you for the last time to forget about the numbers.
I want you to forget these get-rich-quick schemes and start concentrating on doing an honest day's work for a change.
Who are you talking about doing a honest day's work?
Me?
Yeah, you.
Monday you were supposed to straighten out the radiators.
My back was killing me.
Tuesday you were supposed to paint some signs for the yard.
With my arthritis?
Wednesday you were supposed to get the tubs together.
My feet were giving me trouble.
You know what's gonna be bothering you next?
Your stomach!
Because I'll be gone and it'll be empty.
I won't be around much longer to bother you.
Don't start that again.
It's true.
I'll be going to see your mother soon.
You won't have to worry about how much I eat.
You can have it all to yourself.
You'll just be a big, fat orphan.
I've heard this before so I'm leaving.
You'll wish you'd listened to me when my number comes out.
Look.
I know exactly how much money you've got in your pockets and if you bet as much as one nickel on the numbers, you'll be sorry.
And you'll be sorry you didn't bet with me because we could win a lot of money together.
I don't want anything from you except some work done around here.
And this is what I want.
One, I want you to separate the bicycle parts.
Two, pile up the tires.
Three, stack the tubs.
And four, call the undertaker to come take me away from here.
Look, Pop, that little bit of work is not gonna kill you.
Now, I'm coming back for lunch and I expect to see all this work done.
And remember no numbers.
You got that?
Well, you can just push a guy so far, you know.
You can work a man so hard and then he'll just collapse and stretch out.
That's what I'm gonna do now.
Collapse and stretch out.
Hey, Pop, I'm home!
Hey, Pop!
What are you doin'?
I was just helping you with your bath.
Would you like your back scrubbed?
You think you're smart.
That's dangerous, wake up a fella like that.
- What if I'd have been unconscious?
- I knew you was I knew you was unconscious.
When a man is laying flat on his back and his eyes are closed and there's funny sounds coming out of his nose, then he's unconscious.
I see you got a lot of work done.
You didn't do one thing I asked.
Are you gonna stay in this tub all day?
Will you let me explain?
I started to do everything the tires, the tubs.
Then I got this hot feeling all over.
I thought I was gonna faint.
- I didn't know what to do.
- What did you do?
You know that medical book, A Thousand and One Diseases in the Home?
Well, I looked in it to see what it was I had.
- And you know what I got?
- What?
Menopause.
Pop, menopause is something that a woman gets.
Well, maybe I caught it off of some woman.
It's not something you catch.
It happens to women when they get to a certain age.
I don't wanna talk about that.
Get out of that tub.
You didn't get no work done, and you're still not gonna get nothing done 'cause here comes your friend Bubba to waste some more of your time.
- Hi, Bubba.
- Hi, Fred.
Hi, Lamont.
- What's up, Bubba?
- I don't know how to ask you this.
Go ahead, Bubba.
I mean, go ahead and ask.
Man, I'm broke.
Could you let me have five bucks?
You caught me at a bad time, Bubba.
I got it.
You know, I did a dumb thing this morning.
I put my last ten dollars on a number.
Thought I had a sure thing.
I dreamt I was trimming a Christmas tree.
That's 374.
Right!
Could've won $6,000.
Six thousand dollars!
Well, Fred, thanks for the five.
Wait a minute.
You happen to know what number came out today?
The one on riding a bus and train.
- 219!
- That's it.
Did you hear that?
You remember I was telling you about my dream.
If I had just put ten bucks, I'd have $6,000 now.
- Yeah, yeah.
Bubba had a dream too.
- You call that a dream?
Only a born loser dreams about trimming a Christmas tree in September.
If I'd have bet five bucks, I'd have $3,000.
Okay, Pop.
Three thousand dollars.
If I'd have just bet three dollars, I'd have 1,800.
All right!
If I'd have listened to you, I wouldn't have nothing.
But I didn't listen.
I bet a dollar and won 600 bucks.
Six big ones.
No one to talk with All by myself Hey, Pop, you home?
Hey, Pop!
You up there, Pop?
Where did you get that ridiculous outfit?
And where have you been?
You were supposed to help me unload the truck and you just disappeared.
Allow me to answer your second question first.
To begin with, you don't ask a gentleman, who has just won $600 to help you unload.
The gentleman is already loaded.
He's trying to find his own way of unloading the load he's loaded with.
- So that's it.
- Yeah.
To answer your first question this ridiculous outfit was purchased at Phil's Fashion Box.
They said it was very popular at the Kentucky Derby.
You mean the Roller Derby.
- It's also my traveling outfit.
- Traveling outfit?
Where could you possibly be going in that ridiculous getup?
Where would you go?
Go somewhere and have some fun.
Take a trip.
What would you do with six big ones in your pocket?
I mean, five big ones, 'cause I left one big one at Phil's Fashion Box.
Well, I guess I was wrong.
I thought you were gonna be smart about it and put that money in the bank.
There's more important things that we could use that money for than a trip.
You name something more important than taking a trip and maybe I won't go.
All right.
The truck could use four new tires.
This house could stand a new paint job and some decent furniture.
And I, for one, could use a new outfit.
What do you say now?
I'll drop you a postcard.
You're really gonna go, aren't you?
Yes.
And you could go too if you hadn't stopped me from playing the number.
You're gonna blow $500 on a trip?
Do you mind if I ask where you're going?
A place I've always wanted to go before I die.
Intrigue, excitement, wildlife, big game.
Don't tell me you're going to Africa.
No, I'm going to Las Vegas.
See right here.
It figures.
You win some money and now you're gonna blow it on the crap table.
Crap table?
You know I can't shoot no craps with my arthritis.
But it's just right for holding them handles on the slot machines.
I'm not gonna say another word about it.
Just go ahead.
Have fun.
- I will.
- Don't even think about me.
I won't.
I begged you not to go, and what was your answer?
I went.
You're really a selfish old man.
You know what it says in the Bible?
"God loveth a cheerful giver.
" And there's another one in there that I like.
It also says "Take thee care of number one.
" That must be Bubba.
He's gonna drive me to the airport.
- You mean, you're gonna fly?
- All the time I'm gone.
- Ethel.
- Hello, Fred.
Hello, Lamont.
Fred, I heard about your good luck.
Congratulations.
Isn't it wonderful?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm going to Las Vegas, you know.
Oh!
Good!
And I brought you something to help you celebrate.
Why don't you sit over here?
Something just for you.
Something you like very much.
Pig tails and black-eyed peas.
That's so nice of you.
Thanks.
Delicious!
Yeah, well, I'm sure glad somebody can enjoy them.
- Lord knows I sure can't.
- What are you talking about?
- You don't wanna hear about it.
- What's the matter, Aunt Ethyl?
It's my gallbladder.
- It's your what?
- My gallbladder.
But you don't wanna hear about it, do you, Fred?
No, not while I'm eating pig tails.
What's the matter with your gallbladder?
Plenty.
The doctor says it's supposed to be the size of a pear.
- Mine is the size of a Persian melon.
- No kidding.
Imagine walking around with a Persian melon inside you.
What are you gonna do about it?
- I'm supposed to have an operation.
- When are you gonna have it?
When I get the money.
Guess I'll see what's keeping Bubba.
- How expensive is the operation?
- Very expensive.
I've got most of the money, but I need an extra $200.
But you don't want to hear about it, do you, Fred?
Gee whiz, Bubba oughta be here by now.
I wish I had the $200 to give you so you can have that operation.
But, hey, wait a minute.
Why don't we ask Pop?
He's got it.
I'm going outside and see if I can see Bubba.
Pop, did you hear that?
Aunt Ethel needs an operation on her gallbladder real bad.
We oughta give it to her.
Las Vegas will always be there.
And so will her gallbladder.
Look, let's leave everything where it is.
Pop, I think you oughta help.
This isn't just anybody.
This is Aunt Ethyl, Mom's sister.
Did you ever stop to think you might be the one to save her life?
Wait a minute.
Say, Ethyl, what did the doctor say?
I mean, is there any danger in case you don't have the operation?
When will you be coming back from Las Vegas, Fred?
- Ten days.
- I'll be with Elizabeth by then.
- Did you hear that, Pop?
- Yeah, I heard her.
I don't know how much pain it is having a gallbladder removed from your stomach.
But the pain don't compare with having two big ones removed from your pocket.
Oh, Fred!
Do you mean it?
Is that for me?
- Yeah, go on.
Take it.
- Oh, Fred, I don't know what to say.
I think I'm gonna cry.
Me too.
Fred, thank you and bless you.
Bless you, Lamont.
Bless you both.
And bless this house.
Don't say nothing to me.
Don't say a word.
You think you'll keep me from going on my trip.
You're wrong.
I'm going anyhow.
Pop, I was just gonna say that that was a nice thing you just did.
Doesn't it make you feel better?
Don't you feel warm inside?
Yeah.
Like heartburn.
There's Bubba now.
Late by $200 and a gallbladder.
I'll see you in five days instead of ten, son.
- Ain't you taking me to the airport?
- What's the matter?
You sick?
Don't tell me you're sick and need an operation 'cause surgery is closed.
How could she do that?
How could she do this to me?
How could who do what to you?
Who you talking about?
You remember my ex-wife Maxine?
Maxine.
Is that the one that cut up your clothes when she left you that day?
Yeah.
Max the Knife.
What happened?
What did she do?
She sued me for back alimony, and I didn't have it, so they took my car.
So in other words, you can't drive me to the airport.
In other words, I can't drive myself to work.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Well, don't worry, Bubba.
I'll call myself a taxi.
- How much do you need to get your car?
- I need $250, Lamont.
Is that all?
Did you hear that, Pop?
All Bubba needs is $250 to get his car back.
Is this the taxicab company?
This is a serious emergency.
You gotta help him.
Bubba's your best friend and you're the only person that can help him out.
He needs $250.
I only got 300 left.
He won't be able to go to work without his car.
Bubba's in big trouble.
- What about my trip?
- What about it?
If it was the other way around, you know Bubba would give you that money.
He wouldn't think about nothing else.
What do you say, Pop?
I say, "Good-bye, Las Vegas.
Hello, Watts.
" Bubba, here's the money for your car.
Gee, Fred, I really do appreciate this.
Don't you kiss me, Bubba.
I'm going to get the car and drive you to the airport.
For what?
To watch the planes take off and land?
I ain't got no money.
- I can't go nowhere.
- I'm sorry about that, Fred.
But, you see, you saved my life.
Bless you, Fred.
Bless you, Lamont.
Bless this house.
Satisfied now?
I'm broke.
That's what you wanted so I couldn't go nowhere.
You gave that money to Aunt Ethel and to Bubba because you are a good person.
You are.
You don't want to admit it, but you've got a big heart.
It's not my big heart that got me broke.
It was your big mouth.
All I know is you did two nice things today and you still got $50 left.
You want it?
There it is.
Take it.
It's yours.
- I couldn't take it.
Take it back.
- What do I need it for?
For what?
Here comes another touch here now.
- Mr. Sanford?
- Yes.
Mr. Sanford, I'm with The Los Angeles Times.
We're doing an in-depth story on people who win these private lotteries.
- I heard you hit the number today.
- Where'd you hear that?
We have our ways.
I'd like to get a picture of you holding up your winnings.
That's too bad.
My pop gave most of the money away to friends who needed it.
- All that's left is this $50.
- Oh, that's it, huh?
- That's it.
- That's all there is.
Well, if that's all there is, that's all there is.
I'll take it!
- Great day in the morning!
- It's a stickup!
You're not from The Los Angeles Times.
If I was, would I be doing this, dummy?
What are you doing?
In case anybody else come in asking me for some of my winnings What's the matter?
Didn't you sleep well last night?
Could you repeat that?
I said, "Terrible.
I was up all night.
I had a nightmare.
" No kidding.
What kind of nightmare?
I was dreaming I was walking down the street with no clothes on.
That must've been a nightmare for the people on the street too.
- Then a cop started chasing me.
- That's a nightmare, all right.
And it turned out that the cop was a woman.
Uh-oh.
Now the nightmare becomes a fantasy.
And she was chasing me and she finally caught up with me.
She was writing me a ticket when she noticed I didn't have no pockets.
Then she started chasing me again.
That's a common dream.
Walking down the street with no clothes on.
Lots of people have that dream, Pop.
Oh, yeah?
I didn't meet anyone I knew.
It was terrible.
- Hey, wait a minute.
- What's the matter?
- Let me look in my book.
- What are you doing?
I'm gonna see what Lucky Lucille's got to say about that dream.
- Oh, Pop.
- That's right.
Here it is right here.
"Dreaming about walking and/or running down the street with no clothes on.
Number 186".
- 186.
That's unbelievable.
- Why?
That's what I weigh buck naked.
I ain't gonna let no hunch like this pass me by.
Don't tell me you're gonna play the numbers again.
I'm going to the pool hall now and put my numbers in.
What are you taking a suitcase for?
Because when I win, I'm going from the pool hall straight to the airport.
Bye.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Morning, Bubba.
What you doing here so early?
I stopped by for a cup of coffee.
- Yeah?
Where's Pop?
- He's gettin' the coffee.
- Can I see that sports page?
- Yeah.
Here.
Pop, could you make that two coffees?
You're gonna have to yell louder.
He went to the store to get it.
What's the matter with him?
He knows if I don't have coffee when I get up my hands start to shake and my eyes get all blurry.
That's funny.
That happens to me after I drink your father's coffee.
- I can't wait.
I'm going to the diner.
- Wait.
He'll be back soon.
Are you kidding?
The way he moves?
It takes him over an hour just to make Minute Rice.
He won't be gone that long.
He's not walking.
He took the truck.
He took the truck?
He didn't!
- What's the matter with that?
- He's a rotten driver.
Who, Fred?
He's been driving before you were born.
Yeah, and that was a good time for him to be driving too 'cause there was fewer people on the streets to be hit.
- Did he take his glasses?
- Yeah, he took three pair.
One for driving, one for reading and one for his dizzy spells.
We're in trouble now, Bubba.
Listen, Lamont.
My mother always said "No sense in worrying about something that hasn't happened yet.
" You're right.
- Uh-oh.
You can start worrying now.
- What's goin' on?
What happened?
- It's okay.
Your father had an accident.
- I'll handle this.
It's okay.
Your father had an accident.
Okay, what happened?
Who'd you hit and how many people are dead?
I didn't hit nobody.
They hit me.
They rammed me from the rear.
I was sitting, minding my own business, then all of a sudden, wham!
Hold it.
"Driver struck vehicle while sitting, minding his own business, when all of a sudden, bam"!
No.
Wham.
That's W-H-A-M.
That's "ham" with a W in front.
I know.
What happened then?
Then I almost went through the windshield.
That's W-I-N-D Well, if you can spell "wham," you can spell "windshield.
" - Weren't you wearing your seat belts?
- What?
Your seat belts.
Don't you have seat belts in the truck?
First things come first.
We just had the seat put in last week.
You were struck from behind.
Then what?
Then the guy that hit me, he just went around and drove off.
Did you get a license number or see who was driving the car?
No, I didn't get no license number, but I saw who was driving the car.
It was a white fella driving a black Cadillac.
- Are you sure about that, Pop?
- Sure, I'm sure.
There's more white men in black Cadillacs than there is black men in white Cadillacs.
So it was a white man in a black Cadillac.
Mr. Sanford, as far as you can ascertain did you suffer any bodily injuries such as fractures, contusions or concussions?
Did you get done in?
I didn't get done in.
I feel all right.
I just got shook up a little.
You had to take the truck, didn't you?
Who told you to take the truck?
Nobody had to tell me to take the truck.
It's my truck.
I got civil rights.
- You don't even have a driver's license.
- You don't tell me what I have.
What do you think is in here?
Look at that.
What does that look like?
It looks like a J.C. Penney charge plate.
Wait a minute.
Oh, here it is.
What does that say?
"California Driver's License.
Fred Sanford.
" S- A-N-F-O-R-D.
Period.
- May I see the license please?
- You wouldn't wanna see a bad picture.
Let's go down, take a look at that truck.
- Where is the truck?
- Down at the corner.
- Is that down by Fulmer Street?
- Yeah.
Okay, we'll have a look.
Wait till Lamont sees the back of that truck.
He's gonna blow his top.
- Forget about the truck.
- I can't.
- Forget about Lamont.
- I'd like to.
Listen to me, Fred.
You don't know this but, man, you are sitting on top of a gold mine.
I'm what?
Didn't you say you were stopped and another car rammed into you from behind?
- Yeah.
- Cadillac?
- Yeah.
- White man?
- Yeah.
- You sitting on top of a gold mine!
- What are you talking about?
- You ever hear of whiplash?
Whiplash.
Is that the movie with Buster Crabbe?
No!
You're thinking about Whipsaw.
That's right, Whipsaw.
I can see it now.
It was a movie on television.
You know who was in it?
Dennis Morgan and Ida "Lupini.
" It must've been Spencer Tracy and Myrna Loy.
Let me tell you.
Sit down.
Spencer Tracy, he was a plainclothes detective, and he was trailing Myrna Loy.
When he got to this farmhouse, they went inside to see if they could help.
And as they tried to help this farmer, his wife was having quintuplets.
They had to stay all night long.
And the next morning, he said to her "Are you all right"?
And then she said, "Of course I'm all right.
" He said, "You bet you're all right.
" Watch this, Bubba.
He hit her on the chin like this "You bet you're all right.
" We're not talking about Whipsaw.
We're talking about whiplash.
Whiplash is what you get when you get hit from behind.
- The insurance companies pay real big.
- They do, huh?
I'm telling you, Fred, you're in the clear.
It's always the guy that hits you in the back that's to blame.
He has to pay.
Every time.
- Every time?
- Every time.
- I was hit from the back.
- Yes, you were.
- By a Cadillac.
- Right.
- Driven by a white man.
- Yeah.
Bubba, you know, I am sitting on top of a gold mine.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
- What do I do now?
- You don't do nothing.
Tell 'em about your neck feeling funny.
Make a big thing out of it.
Maybe I should go back to where I had the accident and lay down in the street.
No, you don't have to.
Just keep talking about your neck feeling funny.
Well, my neck is starting to feel funny right now.
Good.
Just see how funny you can make it feel.
Don't worry, Bubba.
When I get finished, my neck will be hysterical.
- Watch out.
They're coming back.
- I'll be ready for 'em.
There's not that much damage.
It could've been a lot worse.
- What's the matter with you?
- My neck's feeling funny.
- Your neck?
- Yeah.
I can't move it.
See?
A few minutes ago your neck was fine.
It ain't fine now.
I'm sick and my neck hurts.
Tell him, Bubba.
That's right.
As soon as you all went out, he told me his neck felt funny.
Is it a stiff, painful feeling?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what it is.
A stiff, painful feeling.
And I can't even turn it.
See?
That's common when you're hit from behind.
You've probably got a whiplash.
Whiplash.
That's what I got is whiplash.
You hear that, Lamont?
Where are you?
Where are you, son?
You wanna know where I am?
Standing right behind you.
That's what I got, Bubba.
Whiplash.
I can see from here you got a whiplash.
Ain't it true Ain't it true that I can sue when I get this whiplash, Swanny?
Speaking off the record, I can tell you that in cases where vehicle one is struck from behind by vehicle two the occupant of vehicle one is in a legal position to obtain monetary compensation from the occupant of vehicle two that party being liable for all damages incurred by the occupant of vehicle one.
Brother, you're sitting on top of a gold mine.
- Smitty.
- Huh?
What?
Oh, oh.
Listen.
What I mean is we can't lay any legal advice on you.
All we can do is get the facts.
- You got my name?
- Yeah.
- You got whiplash?
- Right.
That's all the facts you need.
Mr. Sanford, we'll get right on it.
You'll be hearing from us.
I wanna hear from that guy who was driving that Cadillac.
He's responsible.
I'm gonna sue him for everything he's got.
- Right in.
- On.
On.
Congratulations, Fred.
Beautiful!
And thanks, Bubba, for tipping me off about that whiplash.
- It rhymes with "getcash.
" - Yeah!
Are you two serious?
- You think you'll get away with this?
- What are you talking about?
About how you claim you got hit by a white man in a Cadillac.
- You think I'm lying?
- No, I think you're dreaming.
It's better to dream about getting hit by a white man in a Cadillac than by a black man in a Toyota.
I ain't dreaming.
And I'll betcha he'll think twice before he comes driving around this neighborhood again in his big Cadillac.
Pop, what?
The streets are public.
You can drive wherever you want.
- You think so?
- That's right.
Did you ever try cruising through Beverly Hills?
No, but I can if I want to.
You do that.
And you'll come away feeling like a cheap watch.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you'll be stopped every few seconds.
Explain to me how come your neck is all of a sudden all right.
Oh, there it goes again!
Can you hear it click?
Listen.
Well, it was clicking.
You can die from something like this.
You hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm comin' to join you, honey, with a clicking neck.
Fred, I hope you sue the pants off the guy that hit you.
I am.
I'm gonna sue him for everything I can get.
Just wait till I get in that witness chair.
Look, Bubba.
I'm in the witness chair.
You're the one asking the questions.
Ask me what happened.
- What happened, Mr. Sanford?
- I got hit from the back.
- Ask me who hit me.
- Who hit you, Mr. Sanford?
A white man in a new Cadillac.
- Ask me what I'm sitting on.
- What are you sitting on, Mr. Sanford?
I am sitting on top of a gold mine, Your Honor.
A gold mine in the sky Far away, far away Hey, Pop, I'm down.
Is breakfast ready yet?
- Morning, son.
- What is that?
- What does it look like?
- You really wanna know?
You look like a big, fat turtle.
Be careful when you go to the beach.
Some kid will make a pet outta you.
- Are you finished?
- I wanna know where did you get that.
Bubba gave it to me.
You gotta wear one of these when you got whiplash.
It makes it more correct when you go to collect.
- You're really counting on that.
- Why shouldn't I?
Why shouldn't you?
They have no other witnesses who saw the other car.
They might not ever find the other car.
I think you made the whole thing up.
- Shall I continue?
- No, I'll continue.
You're a dummy.
Everybody knows about whiplash.
They gonna find the man.
And  I wish you would get the H outta here.
- I wonder who that is.
- I don't know.
You ain't getting no money for that whiplash, I'll betcha.
You're not getting a cent, because you drummed up the whole thing.
- Mr. Sanford?
Fred Sanford?
- Yeah.
I'm Dr. Caldwell.
Your friend, Bubba, suggested that I come by and have a look at you.
Come on in, Doc.
This is my son, Lamont.
- Good morning, young man.
- Say, what's going on, Pop?
Bubba said you gotta have a doctor to prove that you got whiplash.
You just can't tell 'em.
You gotta have a doctor.
- And you're a doctor?
- In some states.
And you're gonna examine my pop?
That's the purpose of my call.
How can you prove if a man has whiplash?
Mr. Sanford, after you were struck from behind, did your neck feel funny?
Yeah.
This man has whiplash.
That's all there is to it?
That's absolutely all there is to it.
Tell me something, Doctor.
Are you a bone specialist?
No.
I'm a whiplash specialist.
- That's all you do?
- Just about.
It's a pretty big field.
I think it's third in the country today.
Obstetrics, dermatology and whiplash.
And they pay a lot of money for that, don't they?
- That depends.
Who hit you?
- A white man in a new Cadillac.
I'd start taking some French lessons.
Why?
Why would I take French lessons?
It'll be easier when you go to live on the French Riviera.
Mademoiselle from Armentieres Parlez-vous And that will be ten dollars.
Here is my telephone number.
There's always somebody there.
Caldwell and Caldwell.
Caldwell?
Is that your brother?
He's a doctor too?
Oh, no, that's my father.
The telephone's in his name.
Good day, gentlemen.
Thanks a lot, Doc.
You better get a doctor to see about that cough, Doc.
You still worried?
You heard the doctor say I can get money for this.
They pay good.
They.
Wait until they find out that you're faking this whole thing.
- Who's faking?
- You are.
- I'm not.
I got a pain in the neck.
- You have, huh?
Yeah, and the more I talk to you, it moves downward.
I still say that you're faking.
You didn't even know what whiplash was.
I do now.
When you get hit from the back, that's whiplash.
When you get hit from the front, that's one across the lips.
- Now what?
- Wait a minute.
That's him.
Come on out.
I want you to see something.
- Mr. Sanford?
- Yeah.
Don Sanderson of Sanderson Motors.
There it is.
Isn't she a beauty?
What's going on?
Whose pickup truck is that?
- It's ours, or it's gonna be.
- And a great little buy you're getting.
- What are you talking about?
- We're gonna need a new truck.
What for?
There wasn't that much damage done to the old one.
- The tailgate was all smashed.
- It was dented!
It was caved in.
And I ain't gonna drive around with my tailgate caved in.
We can't afford this truck.
That's what they all say till we sit down and show you how easy it is to be the proud owner of a new Fireside 360.
Air-conditioning, radio You're wasting your time.
Time?
Is that your problem?
I'll give you the time you need.
No, you see, we can't afford this truck because last year our sales was down Down?
You wanna know how much you have to put down.
Would you believe Mr. Sanderson, there's no way we can afford this truck.
No way.
Oh.
Well, your father felt rather certain you could.
And we can.
Maybe not this very minute, but we could have him hold it for us.
We're comin' into a whole lot of money real soon.
- An inheritance?
- No.
Whiplash.
You were in an accident?
Yeah, rammed from the rear by a guy driving a Cadillac.
- He hit you?
- Yeah.
- What were you doing?
- Waiting on a signal to change.
- A new Cadillac?
- Brand-new.
- In whose name will it be registered?
- We can't afford a new truck.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
- Don't interfere in family arguments.
- We didn't called the police.
Fred, we got good news.
- They apprehended the suspect.
- They did?
What do we do now?
Come to the station and identify him.
Let's go identify.
Wait for us, Mr. Sanderson.
Don't move.
Why should we move?
Sanderson Motors has been at the same location for 22 years.
We're the number-one choice of new car buyers in all of Los Angeles.
We talk everybody's language.
Se habla espanol.
Buon giorno!
Shalom!
Right on!
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- Sit here, Fred.
I'll be right back.
Smitty, now, you say it's a hit-and-run, so he's in big trouble, huh?
They'll throw the book at him.
See that?
I told ya, they're gonna throw the book at him.
And you know what kind of book?
A checkbook, autographed to me.
That's right!
There's a gold mine in the sky - Watch.
You don't believe me, do you?
- No, I don't.
You don't believe nothin'.
Even as a kid, you didn't believe in Santa Claus.
You're the one that was responsible for that.
Me?
Yes, you.
You told me there was no Santa Claus.
I ain't told you there was no Santa Claus.
I said, wouldn't no white man be comin' 'round in our neighborhood wearing no red velvet suit at 12:00.
Hey, Fred.
That's the man.
That's him, Smitty.
No, that's him.
I'd recognize them beady blue eyes anywhere.
Don't stop me.
I've been waiting for a chance to tell you something.
You drive around in that big ol' expensive car.
You gotta obey the law just like everybody else.
You're a worse criminal than the worst criminal.
Lock him up, and get him out of here.
I'm trying to tell you, this isn't the man that ran into you.
I'm telling you, take him outta here and Huh?
Well, who are you?
Lieutenant Driscoll of the Los Angeles Police Department.
Well, Lieutenant, you know, all you lieutenants look alike to us.
We'll be bringing the suspect in shortly.
Who's this gentleman?
My son, Lamont.
This is Lieutenant Driscoll of the Los Angeles Police.
Who is this, the captain?
The suspect.
Wha Yeah, of course that's the suspect.
You don't think I'd know that?
That's him, Lamont.
- Make absolutely sure, Mr. Sanford.
- Oh, I'm sure.
This is the end of the line for you, playboy.
You ain't gonna be coming around our neighborhood, messing around no more.
I hope they take your car and your house away from you.
- Mr. Sanford?
- Will you hold on?
You hurt people and do like you please.
It's a new ball game today.
Will you hush just a moment?
I'm gonna have to teach you a lesson.
The only way I can do that is to sue you for everything you've got.
I ain't gonna take no more pity on you than you took on me when you hit me.
That's right.
You're gonna get yours.
- What?
- I didn't say nothin'.
Better not say nothin'.
The accident I had, I might not ever be able to turn my neck again.
I can't even turn my neck.
I won't be able to watch a tennis match.
Mr. Sanford, listen.
- This is not the man that owns the car.
- He's the one that hit me.
That's true.
But he doesn't own the car.
He stole the car.
He stole it?
That mean I can't sue him?
Then who's gonna pay for the damage to my truck and my neck?
I don't know.
But thank you for the cooperation.
Book him, men.
Pop, don't feel so down.
That's the way the breaks fall sometimes.
But look at it this way.
You helped the police to trap a criminal.
Yeah.
You know what, Pop?
We're not that far from Chinatown.
What do you say we go there and get ourselves a nice dinner and just forget about what happened?
- What do you say, Pop?
- Okay.
Do you think you'll be able to eat with that thing around your neck?
- I don't know.
- I know this restaurant in Chinatown.
We can go there and for a buck and a quarter we can get a nice meal.
Pop, I'm home!
Where are you?
- I was fixing some lunch.
What's up?
- Nothing.
I picked up the truck.
It looks pretty good.
You can't even tell where you were hit.
- No kidding.
- Yeah, and we were lucky.
That guy who owned that Cadillac offered to pay for the damages.
- He didn't have to do that.
- I know that.
You should let that be a lesson to you.
- Never build up your hopes too high.
- That what I did?
That's exactly what you did.
Did you ever hear of overconfidence?
Overconfidence.
Was that with James Cagney?
No, I'm talking about how somebody like Bubba can come in here with some dumb suggestion and you go overboard.
Overboard.
With Dennis Morgan and Ida "Lupini.
" That was it.
I saw that.
Dennis Morgan was a jewel thief.
Wait.
Move over.
He was a jewel thief and trailed Ida "Lupini" 'cause she had a lot of jewels.
They were on this big ocean liner.
He followed her all around.
He found out when she left her room.
He went in to steal her jewels.
She came back and caught him.
Right there he fell in love with her.
There was this big love scene when he said to her "I could never steal anything from you, you son of a gun.
" And then he hit her on the chin, boom, like that.
That was beautiful.
- Wanna know how it ended?
- No.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Lamont, where you been?
You should have been home an hour ago.
What's the matter with you, Pop?
What are you so excited about?
My cousin Grady from St. Louis, he's gonna stop off and see us.
Cousin Grady?
I got a date tonight, Pop.
I don't wanna see no cousin Grady.
Wait a minute, Lamont.
You'll wanna meet him.
- He's my favorite cousin.
- Close the door.
Flies be comin' in.
Okay.
He's my He's my favorite cousin.
Really.
He's so funny.
He's like the life of the party everywhere he go.
When he passed by the cemetery, know what he say?
"People just dyin' to get in there.
" Ain't that funny?
- Do you get it?
- I got it.
He's so full of fun.
Wait till you meet him.
You'll love him.
Know what else he said?
- What?
- Know what he call his self?
The white sheep of the family.
- You get it?
Instead of saying - I know.
I know.
Pop, cousin Grady sounds like a barrel of laughs, but I got a date tonight.
Wait a minute, son.
Come here.
I want to show you cousin Grady's picture.
It's in the album here.
You might remember him?
You met him when you were little.
Come on.
Sit down.
Pop, I told you.
I don't have time Sit down.
It ain't gonna take you about a minute.
- Now, look it there.
- Is that cousin Grady?
No, that's your Uncle Toot.
See, Uncle Toot was a chef on the Titanic but he never got a chance to cook nothin'.
Come on, Pop.
And here's your fourth cousin here.
This is your fourth cousin on your great, great aunt's side AuntJennie.
See, AuntJennie married Uncle Tips.
See, he had a wooden leg.
During the Depression, he had a job picking up paper in the park.
The way he did it, he sharpened the tip.
Really.
He sharpened the tip on his wooden leg and then he went through the park like this.
- Would you stop it.
- And he worked there a long time.
He sharpened it so many times it got so short they had to lay him off.
- Well, I gotta go, Pop.
- Wait a minute, son.
Just a moment.
Listen.
I just got a few more Will you look at that?
That's you when you were a baby.
You're probably the ugliest baby I ever saw.
Really.
I don't know who was uglier you or that old bear rug you're laying on.
Well, you're my father.
Wasn't I supposed to look like you?
Well, no.
A lot of people thought you favored the bear.
- There's Grady.
- Great.
Tell him I said hi, Pop.
Wait a minute, son.
Listen.
Aren't you gonna stay and see him?
- I already told you I got a date.
- Listen, Lamont.
Your own flesh and blood is coming to see you and you ain't gonna be here.
See, Grady's bringin' his new bride and his stepdaughter to meet us.
I wanna make a good impression and you ain't gonna be here.
Okay, then.
Well, go ahead on your old date.
I don't care.
All right, Pop, what do you want me to do?
Break your date.
I'd do it for you.
When do you ever have dates?
Are you kiddin'?
I got a date Thursday.
I've been invited to theJunkmen for Nixon Rally.
And if you don't want me to go, I won't go.
All right, I'll break my date.
Thank you, son.
And I'll break mine.
Come on.
Help me clean up for the company.
Uh-oh.
It's too late for that, Pop.
Looks like your company's arrived.
Doggone it.
- Hello.
- Hi!
Hey, Grady, Grady, Grady.
Good to see you.
Grady, Grady, always shady.
Fred, Fred, old cabbage head.
Give me five so I can stay alive.
I'll let you have two till Lou gets through.
- Can you still do that dance?
- Yeah.
- And what about - Susie Q. Susie Q. - Grady, good to see you.
- Hey, who is this, Fred?
Don't tell me this is little Lamont.
My goodness how you've grown.
The last time I saw you you was about knee high to a June bug.
Fred, this is my new bride Margaret.
Margaret, this my favorite cousin Fred and his son Lamont.
I've heard so many fine things about you, Mr. Sanford.
- Please call me Fred, Margaret.
- I will.
Let's all sit down and talk about old times.
Let's do that.
BettyJean, come on.
What's keeping you?
- It's good to see you.
- You're lookin' good.
This is my stepdaughter BettyJean.
BettyJean, I'd like you to meet Fred Sanford and his son Lamont.
- Hello, everybody.
- Hi, BettyJean.
I'm so hungry.
BettyJean, you can't be hungry.
Didn't you take your diet pill?
Yes, I did, and it made me hungry.
Oh, BettyJean, put that away.
You're supposed to be dieting.
I am dieting.
This candy is dietetic bittersweet chocolate flavor and low-cal.
And besides, I've already lost 40 pounds.
BettyJean, you mind if I ask you a question?
How long have you been dieting?
She belongs to this Weight Watchers club back home and they meet once a month.
What do they do, eat for 30 days?
Oh, no.
We talk about what we didn't eat.
I bet that's a short conversation.
Excuse me, BettyJean, but how much did you weigh before you lost the 40 pounds?
I don't remember.
See, I'm one of those unlucky people.
The least little thing I eat and I just blow up.
I think it's glands.
Well, you better stop messin' with them glands.
Say, why don't we go into the kitchen and fix them something to eat, Pop.
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Don't go to any trouble.
Don't worry.
We'll just throw something together.
It'll be no trouble at all.
It's good to see him, ain't it, son?
Hey, Pop, do you believe her?
That's a big girl, ain't it, son?
And she says she lost 40 pounds.
If she'll look behind her, she'll find 'em.
Say, listen.
What are we gonna fix for her to eat?
What about a whale?
You know what?
We oughta lock her up in the refrigerator and let her go herself.
That Lamont is a handsome young man, isn't he?
He certainly is.
And he'll make someone a fine husband.
- Wouldn't he, BettyJean?
- I guess so, but I'll bet he can't cook.
- Handsome men don't know how to cook.
- You shouldn't be so choosy.
Cooking isn't everything.
He's good looking, he's intelligent and he's got a cute moustache.
- Don't you like his moustache?
- It's too bushy.
There don't seem to be enough of anything in here to satisfy BettyJean.
- What are we gonna do, Pop?
- We better do something quick.
Fat people get violent when they have nothing to eat.
Hey, I know.
Why don't we tell her we gotta go shopping.
- Hey, let's do that.
- All right.
Say, folks, I'm sorry, but we couldn't find nothing to fix.
- We didn't go shopping this week.
- I love to go shopping.
- May I go shopping with you?
- That's a good idea.
Lamont, you take BettyJean shopping.
See, and I'll stay here and talk with Grady and Margaret.
- What's the matter with you?
- No, go ahead, son.
Take her with you.
Then on the way back you can stop off and get some tacos.
- Oh, tacos.
I love Mexican food.
- Go ahead, son.
- But - Go ahead.
Will we see any Mexicans?
The route that I'm taking, that's all we gonna see.
Fred, I hope we're not imposing on you by staying the night.
Oh, not at all.
Glad to have you.
See, you and Grady can take the front room and Lamont and I, we'll sleep in the back.
And you can go up now if you'd like to and sort of freshen up.
Why don't you do that.
You go freshen up and me and Fred will reminisce.
- All right.
I'll do that.
- Okay.
- You'll find everything up there.
- Thank you.
Hey, Grady, that's a good-looking woman you got there.
- Where'd you meet her?
She's pretty.
- You think she's pretty?
You should see her sister.
Beautiful.
No kidding?
If she's so pretty why is it that your stepdaughter is - Large.
- No - Plump.
- No.
- Fat.
- That's the one.
I don't know.
But she's a nice girl, that BettyJean and just dyin' to get married.
But it's a funny thing.
She's very particular.
She don't just take just anybody 'cause she's got so much to offer.
Yeah.
Maybe that's what the problem is she got too much to offer.
I don't mean that.
I mean, there's more to her than meets the eye.
There can't be.
No, I ain't just talkin' about her physique.
I'm talkin' monetarily.
See, the lucky man that marries her gets a $10,000 dowry.
Ten thousand dollars, Fred.
- You kidding.
- Cash money the day after the wedding.
See, her father left it to her when he passed.
But he stipulated she don't get it till she gets married.
Ten thousand dollars.
That's a lot of money.
Yep.
A man could do a lot with $10,000 especially if he had a little business he was trying to build up.
Yeah.
A man could get a new truck with $10,000.
Fix up his home like brand-new.
- Pay off bills.
- Yeah, and take a trip.
Right.
But it's not gonna be easy to find a husband for her.
She's so shy and all.
- And so misunderstood.
- Right, right.
Say, Grady, what about Lamont?
Lamont?
It never crossed my mind.
He'd be perfect.
You think he'll go for it?
- Sure he'll go for it.
Leave it to me.
- Hey, Fred, that's great!
Hey, Grady.
See, up to now, Grady, we just been cousins.
- But now we're gonna be in-laws.
- Fred, Fred, that's using your head.
Grady, Grady, you still shady.
- Hey, good morning, Pop.
- Good morning, son.
- What you all dressed up for?
- I'm taking our guests out sightseeing.
I got your breakfast ready warming in the oven.
I don't know what it is but it sure smells good.
Yeah, it's good.
- There you are.
- Oh, wow.
Steak and eggs!
No, no, cubed steak and country scrambled eggs with buttermilk biscuits and pure honey.
This sure is an elegant breakfast, Pop.
Yeah, I'm sorry I don't have the champagne that's supposed to go with it.
But would you like some Ripple?
- Some orange juice will be fine, Pop.
- Okay, son.
I'm surprised you got any food left at all.
I guess the blimp hasn't been down here yet.
Say, don't call her that.
BettyJean, she's nice.
Maybe she don't make a good first impression but after a while she grows on you.
Well, I guess it's better to have her grow on you than fall on you.
No, Grady was telling me about BettyJean.
She's sweet and she'll make some man a nice wife.
Uh-huh.
Some man who better be the owner of a supermarket.
- You want anything else, son?
- No, this is fine, Pop.
See, you know you might think I'm crazy for saying this, but I wouldn't mind having BettyJean for a daughter-in-law.
I mean it.
Have you been in the applejack this morning?
No, listen, son.
You're not getting any younger, you know.
I heard you say you wanna get married and settle down to one steady woman.
Yeah, one, not two like BettyJean.
That's just weight you talkin' about.
See, she's not ugly.
You can get rid of weight but you can't get rid of ugly.
You mean me marry BettyJean?
You could learn to love her.
See, love conquers all, even fat.
See, it's like that movie, The Enchanted Cottage with Robert Young and Dorothy McGuire.
They were both ugly but when they were in the enchanted cottage they weren't ugly at all.
They were beautiful to each other.
And it works the same way with fat.
And so this could be our little enchanted cottage right here, huh?
Yeah, now you got it.
- Hey, Fred, we're ready to go.
- We're in the kitchen, Grady.
I'm not askin' you to make up your mind right away, son, but think about it.
You're mad, Pop.
You are stark, raving mad.
- Good morning!
- Good morning.
- We're all ready to go.
Good morning.
- How are you?
- BettyJean going with us?
- No.
Too much walking is bad for her.
Her thighs rub against each other and she gets a rash.
That'll be good.
Then BettyJean can stay here and keep Lamont company.
- What's the matter with you?
- Good morning.
- Hi, Lamont, Mr. Sanford.
- Good morning, BettyJean.
Since you're not goin' with us, stay here and have breakfast with Lamont.
- Well, it's time to go to work.
- No, son.
Come here and sit down and have a cup of coffee with BettyJean.
- Sit down!
- Let's get going, Fred.
- Yeah, we'll see you two later.
- You're gonna be all right.
- And remember, no nibbling.
Good-bye.
- Okay, Mother.
Well, it's time for me to be going.
What do you do?
I mean, just drive around all day?
Yeah.
I drive around and look for stuff.
See ya later.
That must be interesting to go to different places, see different people.
- Different houses and things.
- It's terrific.
I gotta be going.
- I love to travel.
Don't you?
- It's great.
Speaking of traveling, I gotta be traveling.
That's what I'm gonna do when I get married travel.
I mean, really travel, like Europe.
I guess if you marry a rich dude you'll be able to do that.
- I'll have money of my own.
- That's great.
The day after I get married I come into some money $10,000.
- You don't say.
- Yeah.
See, my real daddy left it for me but he said I had to be married before I could get my hands on it.
- Ten thousand dollars?
- Ten thousand.
You're gonna have to be careful 'cause there's a lot of evil old men that would like to get their hands on that money.
Oh, don't I know it.
But what you gotta do is stop 'em before they get a chance to.
- Right.
- Right.
I enjoyed the Roller Derby much more than the sightseeing tour.
Yeah, I liked that Roller Derby too.
Yeah, and you know, that Rocky Kluzewski was something else.
You see him when he bumped into that guy with a left hook?
Yeah, but all that's a fake, ain't it?
Yeah.
I wonder how he got that guy's nose to bleed like that.
Yeah, that was fun.
- Hello, son.
- Hey, Pop.
Did you all have a nice time?
We had a fine time.
We went down to the Chinese Theatre where they got the stars' footprints in the cement.
Yeah, and my footprint was the same size as Joan Crawford's.
- And guess who my feet fit?
- Boris Karloff.
No.
Rudolph Valentino.
- No kidding?
- I got the feet of the sheik.
- All right.
- What's that wine for?
Well, the son of the sheik has got a little announcement to make.
- You have?
What is it?
- You ready?
BettyJean and I are gettin' married.
Where's BettyJean, upstairs?
Come on, honey.
Well, son, that's beautiful.
What made you change your mind about BettyJean?
Well, Pop, I got to thinkin' about what you said.
And if you want me to get married, I'll get married.
- I can't believe it.
- Out of respect to you, of course.
To make a father that I respect happy.
Well, I'm the happiest father in the world.
I'm proud of ya.
Hey, let's drink to our future happiness, Pop.
Just a little toast here.
- All right, first to the bride.
- To the bride.
All right.
- To the groom.
- To the groom.
All right.
- To the grandparents.
- To the grandparents.
To our happy life in St. Louis.
To our happy life St. Louis?
Did I hear you say St. Louis?
That's right, Pop.
BettyJean and I are gonna move to St. Louis and start a little family of Sanfords.
By the time you come to visit us, Pop, you'll have ten grandchildren.
But what about me?
What's gonna happen to me?
Well, I I don't know, Pop.
I guess you'll have to sell the place and move into one of those old folks homes.
Oh!
I feel a bad one comin' on.
What's the matter, Pop?
What's the matter?
I thought this was what you wanted, for me to marry BettyJean.
- Yeah, but see - But what?
Now, BettyJean and I are gonna live in our own enchanted cottage in St. Louis.
See, I don't want you to leave me.
See, I won't make it through the weddin'.
You hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm comin' to join you, honey with a glass of Ripple in my hand.
I don't understand you, Pop.
Here I am doing everything that I thought you wanted and look how you're carrying on.
But I don't want you to leave me.
Are you truly sure you wanna marry her?
Well, not truly.
I was only doin' it for you, Pop.
Then don't do it.
Don't do it for me.
Please don't do it for me.
I don't know what I can do about it now.
I've already asked her.
I gotta get upstairs and start packin' for St. Louis now.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Do you wanna get out of it?
- I wanna do whatever makes you happy.
- Leave everything to me.
You better hurry up because it might be too late.
- Hey, Grady, you comin' down?
- Here I come, Fred!
Oh, Mr. Sanford.
Or should I call you Pop?
- Ain't this exciting, Fred?
- It's just thrilling.
- You ain't even kissed the bride.
- I will when she cut the weddin' cake.
It's gonna be a big one a seven-tiered affairs shaped like a giant pyramid.
That sounds good, Mother.
It's gonna be too bad you won't be able to eat none of your own weddin' cake.
Why not?
Because my son, he's gonna help you with your dieting.
He's a Weight Watchers' weight watcher.
- What does that mean?
- It means he's gonna help you.
Once I tried to lose 22 pounds and he locked the refrigerator.
He caught me tryin' to get in it and he chained me to the bed.
I didn't have nothin' to eat for a week but Ry-Krisp and water.
- Are you serious?
- Of course I'm serious.
He's not gonna chain you.
He's just gonna put you on a strict water diet.
Only seven gallons a day.
See, seven gallons.
And if you don't drink it all he's gonna shove a funnel in your mouth and pour it down your throat.
Mother!
He was tellin' me how he wanted to get you down to around 98 pounds.
Then people wouldn't know you from Shirley Chisholm.
Mother, let's get out of here.
This man scares me.
You go wait in the car, honey.
I'm sorry, Mr. Sanford but I don't think it's gonna work out.
Please tell your son that we decided he is not the man for BettyJean.
Wait a minute.
That's a shame because my son bought a nice gift for her.
He gonna give her a monogrammed sweatbox.
Come on, Grady.
Well, I'm sorry, Grady.
Fred, Fred, the plan is dead.
Grady, Grady, you better join your lady.
- See ya later, Fred.
- Yeah, have a good trip.
- Say hello to all the folks for me.
- Okay.
Here comes the bride - Hey, Pop, where's the bridal party?
- I told you I'd take care of it.
- The wedding's off.
They're gone.
- Really?
- You won't have to go to St. Louis now.
- That's great.
Son, I guess you stuck here with me in our own little enchanted cottage.
Hey, Pop, you're beautiful.
Come here.
Well, I'll see you later, Pop.
Don't wait up for me.
What do you mean don't wait up?
Ain't you gonna stay home for supper?
Pop, I got a date tonight.
I'm already late now.
You can't do that.
I made some arrangement.
I got a surprise for you.
Is another relative comin'?
How much does this one weigh?
No, wait a minute, son.
It's Bubba's niece, Alberta.
I met her.
She's nice.
And I felt so bad about Grady and his stepdaughter so I invited her to come over and have dinner with us.
Listen, Pop.
Give the lady my apologies and tell her that a previous dinner engagement makes it impossible for me to stay.
Wait a minute, son.
That's her now.
Wait a minute.
This is embarrassing.
Look.
I'm getting sick and tired of you trying to set me up with dates.
There's no way I'm gonna stay here and meet this chick.
You got that?
- But, son - No, no, I'm leaving.
Hello, Mr. Sanford.
Hello, Alberta.
This is my son Lamont.
- Come right in, darling.
- Gee, I hope I'm not late.
You're just in time.
Listen.
See, Lamont here has a previous engagement so he won't be able to stay with us because the date makes it impossible for him to stay here.
So I hope you don't mind having dinner with me alone.
- Oh, no, that'll be just fine.
- Oh, swell.
Well, Lamont, I know you got to go, son 'cause this previous engagement that you have is makin' it impossible for you to stay with us.
So, I'm sorry 'cause we got a good dinner planned.
Sit right down, darling, and I'll go check on the meatballs.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Wow.
Five inches taller.
I could be on the Lakers team.
There.
Five inches taller.
Could have been a movie star.
My darling, if I were king I would give you my throne, darling.
Or another movie star, a tall one.
Listen, Scarlett, I don't give a damn.
Say, Pop, I can't find the thing.
I was upstairs and looking for Wait a minute.
Am I shrinking, or are you getting taller?
High-heeled Italian boots?
So what.
Everybody's wearing them.
At 65?
No, at 4.95 at Kinney's on the highway.
How'd you get them so cheap?
Truck ran over 'em.
Man, would you look at them heels?
You're gonna be walking downhill all night.
See, these boots ain't made for walkin'.
They made for standing along side of.
At least that's what the ad said: "Now you can be taller than she is.
" I don't believe you, Pop.
You're ridiculous.
You're going to all this trouble 'cause the barracuda's coming to dinner.
Listen, don't call Donna that.
Now you be nice to her at dinner.
And speaking of dinner, how much did you pay for that rump roast?
- Five seventy-five.
So what.
- Nothing but the best, huh?
Well, it lasts all week.
The Galloping Gourmet show yesterday was called How To Stretch Your Rump Roast.
So, that's what I'm gonna do, stretch my rump roast.
First, let me fix this.
Hey, Pop, you know you look ridiculous in them shoes.
You're tilting forward.
You're liable to fall right on your rump roast.
That ain't funny.
Let me get over here.
Oh, wow.
Help me get out of these things so I can finish cooking dinner.
Say, Pop, how come you're doing all the cooking tonight?
Because Donna's working hard.
And stop asking so many questions.
Bring that wheelchair over here.
What's this old thing doing in here?
Oh, Donna's bringing one of her patients for dinner tonight.
A patient?
What's she bringing a patient over here for?
Well, he's supposed to be with his son-in-law but he's out of town, so Donna's looking after him.
You know she's a practical nurse.
That's all we need is a sick old man over here for dinner.
Whatever you do, Pop, don't give him no rice pudding.
I can't stand when them old men get rice pudding on their chin.
It looks nasty.
Well, we won't have to worry about that.
We'll just put him in the wheelchair and give him a lamb chop bone to gnaw on.
- Where do you want this chair?
- Over by the table.
Oh, no.
I don't wanna look at that old man when I eat.
Well, put it back there by that folding screen and then when he dozes off, we can hide him.
Boy, Pop, I see that barracuda's got you wound around her little finger.
Listen, Lamont.
You call Donna a barracuda again and I'll take this Italian boot and cave in your pasta fazule.
There's your fiancée now.
You try to be nice to her tonight, you hear?
Just for a change try to be nice to her.
- Donna.
- Good evening, Fred.
- Good evening, Lamont.
- Hello.
How are you?
Mr. Wilcox will be in in a minute.
Maybe the old-timer's having trouble getting out of the car.
I'll give him a hand.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Be of good cheer, Osgood is here.
Mr. Wilcox, may I present my fiancé Fred Sanford and his son Lamont.
- How do you do?
- Lamont, Fred, Osgood Wilcox.
How do you do?
- You're in pretty good shape.
- Indeed, I am.
I did 30 push-ups, 50 sit-ups and jogged What did you do?
He read Dear Abby, stood up too fast and almost fainted.
I'm in good condition for a man who's had several abdominal operations because I've had this little sweetie pie to take care of me.
Honey, why don't you go and sit down and relax?
- All right.
- Lamont will give us some drinks.
Do we still have some of that good sherry left?
- Yeah, it's in the refrigerator.
- Well, bring it out, son.
And use them good jelly glasses.
It's a very interesting little place you have here, Sanford.
- What's your game?
- Keno.
What's yours?
No, no.
I mean, what do you do?
- Oh, I'm a coordinator.
- You're a coordinator.
- What do you coordinate?
- Junk.
Hey, Pop, can I see you in the kitchen for a minute?
That kid can't find nothing.
Donna, will you explain to him what it is I collect?
See, I'm not just an ordinary coordinator, I'm a collector.
Oh, you're a collector.
What do you collect?
Antiques?
Bric-a-brac?
Objet d'art?
That's right, junk.
Charming fellow.
Charming.
I told you the wine was right over here.
I know that, Pop.
I wanted to talk to you for a few minutes in private.
About what?
What was it you said that dude out there was, her patient?
- That's right.
- Uh-huh.
- What does that mean?
- That means he's her patient like Richard Burton is Elizabeth Taylor's patient.
Oh.
What are you talking about?
She's his nurse.
Maybe that's the way it started.
I'm telling you, Pop, that dude out there is her boyfriend.
Donna and I are engaged.
Why would she bring a boyfriend here for?
Get the bidding started.
Get two guys competing against each other.
You've been watching too much Peyton Place.
- Get the wine.
Come on.
- I ain't gonna say another word.
- I hope you don't.
- I'm gonna mind my business.
- Please do.
- I ain't gonna say nothing.
Yeah, I'm sorry we was too late.
Had to go down to the basement and get the refreshments.
White wine.
Nothing like white wine.
White wine should be drunk young.
Yeah, I was drunk when I was young.
Oh, it's sherry.
Nothing like a good sherry.
Harvey's?
No, Thrifty's.
Say listen, Wilcox, you don't have to stir it.
No, no, no, Fred.
Mr. Wilcox is testing it for aroma and taste.
- He's quite a wine expert.
- Oh, like my cousin T.J. Oh, is your cousin a connoisseur?
No, he's a wino.
Well, it has an interesting aroma.
Nice and fruity.
Fruity?
Lamont, did you wash the jelly out of these glasses?
I washed these glasses, Pop.
Well, it's pretty good for a domestic sherry.
But one finds the best sherry in Spain.
Yeah, but Thrifty's is closer.
The last time I had some real good sherry was with E.W. Webster the president of Westlander Insurance Company.
Yeah, well, the last time I had some real good sherry was with one-eyed Jimmy Bivens.
He's a big man in the pool hall in the billiard industry.
This reminds me of a very nice little raspberry cordial they serve at the Murietta Hot Springs.
Tell me, Sanford, you go there for the baths?
No, I go upstairs for the baths.
See, I got hot and cold running water and a rubber plug and a plastic brush for my back.
Donna, you're gonna enjoy that tub once we get settled.
I'm sure I will.
Fours years ago when I broke my hip, Donna used to give me my bath.
Oh, really?
She gave you a bath?
It's normal procedure when the patient is incapacitated.
Is that what you were, incapacitated?
Indeed, I was, and I enjoyed every minute of it.
Excuse me.
Pop, can I see you in the kitchen for a minute?
- Check out the rump roast.
- Would you like me to do that?
You just stay here and look after your patient.
Excuse me.
You know, you gotta keep your eye on the rump roast.
Can't let it stay there too long without looking at it.
'Cause you gotta keep your eye on it.
Well, now do you see what I'm talking about?
Oh, what are you You heard him say he had a busted hip an operation on his stomach and he ain't got no hair.
Now what could he possibly do?
I wouldn't know that, Pop.
Why don't you ask Donna?
You watch your mouth.
Pop, don't you see what's happening?
You're bait.
She's using you to get him.
What woman would want him after seeing him in the bathtub?
I'm not gonna stand around here and watch that woman make a fool out of you.
I trust her.
She's wearing my engagement ring.
Oh, big deal.
You gave her a ring.
I'll bet you he gave her that watch she's wearing - Bet.
- Bet.
How much?
- Six-pack.
- It's a deal.
- How we gonna find out?
- I'm gonna ask her.
Wait a minute.
Don't you ask her.
See, you'll hurt your feelings.
I'll ask her.
You can't just run right in and ask something like that.
You gotta lead up to it.
I know how to do it.
Leave it to me.
Come on.
Yeah, we're gonna have a fine dinner tonight.
There's no kidding about that.
- The rump roast is fine.
- Good.
Donna, where'd you get that watch?
I gave it to her.
It's a good-looking watch.
I bet it cost a lot of money.
Actually, there's another gift I'd like to give her.
Oh, really?
And what is that?
I'd like to take her on a trip to the Grand Canyon.
Three glorious days and nights at the Hiawatha Lodge.
- Stop it.
- When I'm calling you Donna, come on, honey.
Let's me and you check the rump roast.
Of course, but didn't you just check it with Lamont?
Yeah, but this time I want a medical opinion.
Wait a minute, Donna.
I didn't bring you in here to check the rump roast.
- That was just an excuse.
- What is it, Fred?
You ain't going down to the Grand Canyon with Osgood, are you?
Why, Fred, I do believe you're jealous.
I'm not jealous.
I just don't want you running to the Grand Canyon with him.
Let him go down in that hole by himself.
Fred, dear, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.
When are you gonna learn how to knock?
I just wanted to know when dinner would be ready.
Why don't you both go and visit with Mr. Wilcox and let me serve dinner?
No, you're a guest here.
You go in, sit down and relax.
Go on.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
Oh, no.
Hey, come here, lover.
Listen, I'm up to my hips in rump roast.
I ain't got no time You should see this.
Come over here.
Oh, what are you talking about?
What is it?
Look at that.
They're out there dipping and everything.
Oh, that ain't nothing.
They ain't doing nothing but dancing.
Uh-huh.
All I know is that he's the dude with the dame and you're the chump with the rump.
- Now what are they doing?
- They dipping and everything.
- How do you like them string beans?
- I love the string beans.
They're very good for you.
They're full of calcium and iron.
Not these string beans.
They full of fatback and bacon grease.
You really enjoy cooking, don't you, Fred?
I love it, Donna.
I'm gonna fix you some surprise meals once we get settled.
- You'll never have to cook.
- Oh, I like that.
Say, excuse.
What are you gonna do about getting a new nurse, Mr. Wilcox?
- How's that?
- Well, you just heard pretty soon Pop and Donna will be married.
- You'll need a new nurse.
- What?
Donna will never leave me.
We can talk about this some other time.
You're not going to continue to work after you marry Pop, are you?
- She sure ain't.
- Now, Fred dear we can discuss it later, okay?
I hate marriage myself.
Don't believe in it.
Tried it three times.
Know what I hate about it?
All the talking.
Talk, talk, talk.
I love talking to Donna.
Donna is different.
I like talking to Donna myself.
Especially when she's massaging my toes.
She did your toes?
Yes, Fred.
When Mr. Wilcox was confined to a wheelchair.
Well, she did my toes too, and I wasn't in no wheelchair.
I was in the front seat of her new Volkswagen.
Did she ever do your neck till it cracked?
Yeah, she did my neck till it cracked.
And the difference is with you, the cracking was medical.
With me, the cracking was love.
Excuse me.
Why don't we all have some dessert?
I'll be happy to get it.
- Did you see that?
- Did I see what?
- How she took my hand.
- She took mine too.
Yeah, but she squeezed mine.
She took your pulse.
You're gonna hate to lose Donna after she marries Pop, huh, Mr. Wilcox?
- They're not married yet.
- You think we won't be?
I don't know why a sweet young thing like Donna should go off and marry a man twice her age.
Twice her age?
Are you kidding?
You know how old I am?
- Seventy-five.
- Fifty-nine.
- Sixty-five.
- Stay out of it.
At least I'm in good shape.
I don't need no nurse looking after me.
Neither do I need a nurse.
Donna is my companion.
She started out as my nurse, but now she's my companion.
We go to dinner together.
We go to the movies together.
- And dance together.
- That's right.
We dance together.
I saw y'all dancing.
Looked like she was holding you up.
Looked like she was carrying a tree stump.
- What are you talking about?
- About that she's your companion.
She's your nurse.
That's what she is.
And you know why?
Because you're sick.
Sick, am I?
He's having a fit.
Hey, that's terrific, Mr. Wilcox.
What's so terrific about lighting a cigarette?
- Let me see you do it.
- I'm not gonna lay down on that floor.
Just because you know you cannot do it.
No, because I know what's been on that rug.
I hate to admit it, Pop, but Mr. Wilcox has got a stronger arm than you have.
Who?
Come over here.
- Move some of that stuff back.
- What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna see how good he is at arm wrestling.
- Come on, muscles.
Sit down.
- All right.
Now, I'm gonna tell you this in front.
That snap, crackle and pop you'll be hearing, won't be no cereal.
It'll be your arm.
- Now ready?
- Ready.
Wait a minute.
I wasn't ready, and you cheated.
- Let's try it again.
- All right.
I know what I can do.
This arm used to lift steel.
And iron.
Cast-iron bricks.
I'd lift a Ford and change my tire.
This is an arm here.
You can You lousy Pop!
There now, are you satisfied?
I got arthritis.
- Well, at least you have something.
- What does that mean?
That means that in assessing your qualifications as a suitable mate for Donna, you've been found wanting.
Would you like me to translate?
Would you like one across your lip?
Pop, Mr. Wilcox is a guest in our house.
I don't mind giving a guest one cross his lip.
Now I think it only fair to warn you that I'm quite skilled at karate.
This nigger's crazy.
These hands are registered as lethal weapons.
Mr. Sanford, I'm a black belt.
I can see that.
All right.
Now you've been duly warned.
I will not take responsibility for what might happen.
Are you kidding?
I'll left hook you to death.
No, stay out of it.
I used to spar with Jim Jeffries JackJohnson, Harry Wills.
Did you ever hear ofJess Willard?
I'm the one who softened him up for Dempsey.
- Tommyrot.
- I fought him too.
Philadelphia.
December 6, 1928.
Knockout in six rounds.
I will not waste my time any further in this ridiculous discussion.
- I'm leaving.
Donna!
- Put 'em up!
Put 'em up!
Come on, put 'em up!
- Donna!
- You'd better call Donna.
You're gonna need a nurse and a doctor when I get through with you.
Come on.
- No, get outta the way!
- Donna!
- Fred, what are you doing?
- Put 'em up!
- Pop!
- Put 'em up!
Come, Donna.
I try not to lose my temper in the face of absurdity.
All right!
I'm ashamed of you!
Are you all right?
- Put 'em up!
- I'm just fine.
Put 'em up.
Come on, I'll knock you out.
Put 'em up!
He wouldn't put 'em up.
If he'd had put 'em up, I'd have shown him my famous bolo.
Wow!
I hate the thought of killing a man over a woman.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I hate to make you feel bad, Pop but didn't you notice something a little strange?
What?
She ran out and immediately took his side.
She didn't even ask you what the fight was about.
That's right.
All she said was that she's ashamed of you.
- That what she said?
- That's exactly what she said.
Why you, Fred Sanford, a decent, hard-working businessman.
An honorable, law-abiding citizen.
A devoted and loving father.
She said she was ashamed of you.
Who does she think she is?
Yeah, who does she think she is?
Yeah.
I don't know who she thinks she is, but I know what she is.
- A barracuda.
- Right.
Fred Sanford, do you mind telling me what that was all about?
What that ridiculous spectacle was all about?
- Listen, I wanna tell you something - And I wanna tell you something.
I think your behavior this evening was childish and inexcusable.
The very idea of fighting a man like Mr. Wilcox.
You didn't even ask to see what we was fighting about.
All you said was you was ashamed of me.
Lamont told me.
I didn't have to know what you were fighting about.
I only know that Mr. Wilcox is a very sick man.
I know he doesn't look it.
He doesn't even know it.
But he's had a series of operations and he's not well.
He's my patient, and he's my responsibility.
And, Lamont, this entire thing might not have happened if not for you.
You encouraged it!
If neither one of you can tell the difference between a patient and a fiancé, there's nothing more I have to say except good night.
And good-bye.
Hey, Pop, she didn't even let you Hey, Pop.
Pop!
She didn't even give you a chance to say nothing.
Wasn't there something you wanted to say?
- Yeah, put 'em up.
- What?
I hope I didn't wake you, but I felt it was important.
No, I was in the kitchen fixing some hot chocolate.
- Would you like some?
Sit down.
- No, thank you.
I've just come to return this.
- Your engagement ring?
- Yes, Fred.
Don't do that, Donna.
I only got I'm sorry, Fred, but after what happened here tonight I don't think you and I can make a go of it.
I'm sorry about that, Donna.
I was gonna tell you, but you ran away.
Now you know I love you.
The only reason I was gonna fight Osgood is because I was jealous of him.
And because I got a dummy for a son.
- Do you really mean that?
- Of course I mean it.
Well, then why don't you say it?
Okay.
I got a dummy for a son.
No, I mean the part about your loving me.
I love you, Donna.
Here.
Put the ring back on, and forget about tonight.
- Okay.
- You mind kissing me in my robe or you want me to change clothes?
No, it's all right.
Come over here and sit down, honey.
This is the way they do in those musicals when you make up.
I saw one last night on television and he said Do I love you Oh, my, do I Honey, indeed, I do Do I need you Oh, my, do I Honey, indeed, I do I'm glad that I'm the one who found you That's why I'm always Hanging around you Do I love you Sanford And Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Oh, you miserable Hello?
Good morning, Bubba.
Yeah, he's up.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I just passed his room and the snoring has stopped and the groaning has started, so he's up.
I don't have time to talk to you now 'cause I'm fixing myself some breakfast.
What?
I'm having some eggs.
Yeah, fried.
No potatoes, Bubba.
And coffee.
And toast, Bubba.
Whole wheat, Bubba.
I gotta hang up now, okay?
Good-bye.
Listen, don't say it.
Don't say one word.
If you do, the headlines in tomorrow's paper will be "Son Goes Berserk And Attacks Old Man.
" - What are you talking about?
- This dumb breakfast I just ruined.
Why can't you cook breakfast?
It's your tooth that's bad, not your hands.
And speaking of that tooth, when are you gonna do something about it?
This has been going on for over a week, and it's not getting better.
I don't want no dentist to be foolin' around in my mouth.
Why not?
They make me nervous.
All them drills and chisels and screwdrivers they be sticking down your mouth.
They don't even care if they hurt you.
They just yank you and thank you.
That's the way it used to be.
Nowadays they give you one of them needles and you don't know what hit you.
- Now I know I ain't goin'.
- Well, why not?
Are you kiddin'?
A needle?
I don't wanna get hooked on that stuff.
It'd change me from Friendly Fred toJunkieJoe.
No.
They give you a shot of Novocain.
Novocain?
What for?
It deadens your mouth.
And in your case, that sounds like a terrific idea.
Ain't nobody gonna give me no shot to deaden my mouth or nothin' else.
Everything stays alive.
You're just gonna walk around here looking like a big, foolish rabbit.
I'm gonna start calling you Bugs Bunny.
Don't worry.
I'll cure it.
What do you think they did before they had dentists?
They hollered a lot.
And finally all their teeth fell out.
And they spent the rest of their days sitting in a cave gumming grits.
- Who is that?
- Bubba.
He's bringing me something.
Come on in.
- Good morning, Fred.
- Morning, Bubba.
- Did you get it?
- Right here, old buddy.
The old asafetida bag.
- That stuff is strong.
- It's supposed to be.
That's how you know when you got a good batch.
What do I do with it, Bubba?
Put it upside my cheek?
That's all.
Just lay it up beside the sore side.
Let me take a look at that sore side.
That's ugly.
- Where you looking at?
- On the left side, toward the front.
That is ugly.
It's on the right side, toward the back.
That's ugly too.
You got a lot of ugliness in your mouth.
- At least mine is on the inside, Bubba.
- Yeah?
- I was only kiddin'.
- Okay, Fred.
- Thanks a lot.
- Okay, Fred.
- Hope your tooth gets better.
- I hope so too.
See ya.
Hey, son.
Wanna know how I'm gonna cure my toothache without goin' to the dentist?
Here's how.
Good Lord, Pop, what is that?
It's a toothache remedy Bubba got from his grandmother.
- That stinking stuff?
What's it called?
- Stinking stuff.
And that's gonna cure your toothache?
What's inside it?
It's an "asafisity" bag.
- A what?
- It's an "asafisity" bag.
See, it wards off all kind of illnesses like cold and flu and pneumonia and toothaches.
Yeah, what's inside that bag?
It got the shell from a rotten egg and a rotten yolk from a rotten egg and the end of a rotten carrot and a whole clove of garlic rotten.
You wear that thing and a garbage truck will pick you up.
- What you say?
- Don't come near me with that thing.
Stay away from me.
That smells terrible.
I don't know how you can wear that.
If I feel If your tooth isn't better when I come back, you're gonna go to the dentist.
You got that?
I'm not gonna argue.
Don't come near me.
I'm not gonna argue.
You are going to the dentist.
Don't come near me.
- I don't wanna go to no dentist.
- Get that smell outta this house.
Wait a minute, son.
Pop, you home?
Pop, you up there?
You are getting sleepy.
Sleepy.
You are completely relaxed.
You will follow my instructions, and you will be completely relaxed.
When you awaken from this experience you will be completely relaxed and without pain.
The pain will be gone.
No more pain.
Say, what is going on in here?
You big dummy.
See what you did?
You broke the spell.
What are you doing?
He was hypnotizing me outta my pain.
You messed it up.
- Hypnotizing?
- Right.
It's a friend of Bubba's.
He's a trained hypnotist.
Professor Poag.
- Professor Sylvester Poag.
- And you're a hypnotist.
- Among other things.
- What does that mean?
I'm also a handwriting expert, a public accountant and a hairstylist.
And you gonna hypnotize my father out of his toothache.
He was doing it too.
Then you walked in, and the pain came back.
Not in my mouth, but a lot further down.
Pop, are you serious?
Do you actually think you can get rid of a toothache with hypnosis?
- I actually think so.
- I don't believe this.
Why are ye fearful, oh ye of little faith?
Are you also a minister?
I'm a minister, a justice of the peace and a reformed rabbi.
See?
Come on, Professor.
Let's get on with it.
Listen.
If you gonna stay, you gonna have to hush because this room is being used for hypnosis.
Let's go, Professor.
All right.
Now, keep your eye on the swinging pendant.
You will find yourself getting completely relaxed.
You will do as I say, and I will rid you of your pain.
You will do as I say, Mr. Sanford, and I will rid you of your pain.
Are you ready to do as I say?
Very well then.
I want you to raise your right arm and hold it straight out.
When I count to three, you will raise your right arm.
It will become rigid, stiff as a board.
You will not be able to move it.
One, two, three.
Mr. Sanford, you weren't concentrating.
You must help me.
Now, I'm gonna ask you to raise your left arm.
Your left arm.
It will become rigid, stiff as a board.
You will not be able to move it.
When I count to three, you will raise your left arm.
One, two, three.
What's the matter, Mr. Sanford?
I can't concentrate.
My son here What happened?
Your son is obviously a willing subject.
He's in a state of hypnosis.
- You're kidding.
- No, it's a fact.
- You mean, he'll do anything you say?
- Just about.
Tell him to fly out of here.
No.
What I'd better do is snap him out of it.
Young man, when I count to three, you will lower your arms and you will feel better than you've ever felt before.
One, two, three.
Well, I'm still waiting.
Yeah, you big dummy.
While you was waitin', he hypnotized you.
What are you talking about?
That's right.
You was standing there with your arms spread out.
All you needed was some tail feathers and you'd look like a buzzard.
And you expect me to believe that?
You don't have to believe it.
I saw you.
You stood glass-eyed like T.J. When he found out he was drafted.
Wasn't he?
- He was out.
- That's right.
- You care to go on, Mr. Sanford?
- No, that little bit did me swell.
I sure appreciate your dropping by.
I feel good.
Say, Professor, how much do I owe you?
Because of the interruptions, I'll only charge you two dollars.
Two dollars.
- And I'll have a tiny shot if it's okay.
- Sure, go right ahead.
Thank you.
I'm also an alcoholic.
I know you're not gonna believe this, but that guy made my tooth feel better.
That's great.
If your tooth is okay, then you can have some lunch.
But I ain't hungry.
Well, if your tooth is all right, how about drinking some ice water?
I ain't thirsty either.
Listen.
If you drink this ice water then that means I won't have to call up the dentist.
If you drink this, your tooth is all right.
Drink some ice water.
- I'll do it, but just to satisfy you.
- You're gonna love that.
How's your tooth feel?
Okay?
Is your tooth okay?
Are you sure your tooth is okay?
Well, let me see you smile.
Your tooth is okay.
You can eat anything.
I won't have to call a dentist.
How about some peanut brittle?
Wait a minute.
How about some ice cream?
Some ice cream, Pop?
Huh?
Where you goin'?
I don't understand.
If the tooth is all right, where you goin'?
I told you, I don't wanna see no doctor 'cause my tooth don't hurt no more.
It's that old story.
Once you get to the dentist's office, the pain stops.
- Sit down.
- I will not.
What?
You're gonna have to sit down when the doctor examines you.
No, I ain't.
I'm gonna be in a running position.
I don't know why you didn't let me see the hypnotist again.
He was a lot cheaper than this.
Pop, this is a city clinic.
It's free.
So is an autopsy free.
You don't see me running down there trying to get none, do you?
Would you sit down?
- I don't wanna sit down.
- Sit down over there.
What?
What's that?
- Sounds like a drill to me.
- Then I know I ain't staying here.
Sit down.
Lamont, listen.
Listen to that.
That sound like one of them drills they use in an aircraft plant.
If the doctor's hand slipped, wham!
It's a hole in my head.
You mean another hole in your head.
If you don't stay right where you are and get this over with I'm not going back home, and I'm not going back to work.
Is that clear?
- Yeah, it's clear.
- Good.
- Just one thing.
- What?
- I'll do it, but under one condition.
- And that is?
I want a white dentist.
- What did you say?
- You heard me.
I want a white dentist.
What makes you think you're gonna get a black dentist?
You said it's a free clinic, didn't you?
Where do you think you find black dentists?
In Beverly Hills?
Wasn't you the guy that told me that you didn't want nothing white but milk?
My tooth wasn't hurtin' then.
Explain to me why you want a white dentist all of a sudden.
Because I want the best available dentist for my tooth.
That's why.
Now, just by coincidence, the best dentist schools are of the white people, by the white people and for the white people.
Don't it seem likely that the best dentists would be white?
White dentist, please.
Do you know that Dr. Charles Drew the man that developed blood plasma, was a black man?
And that the first successful open-heart surgery was performed by a black man?
If I need blood plasma or open-heart surgery, I'll get a black man.
But right now, I want a white man for my tooth.
Do you realize you're turning your back on the brothers?
Who?
No, I ain't.
A brother's all right for a drinking buddy but for my tooth I want a white dentist.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
May I help you?
Yeah.
I called about an appointment for my father.
The name is Sanford.
Oh, yes.
May I ask you a few questions?
And may I ask you one?
Pardon me?
Do you just go out with dentists or could you squeeze in a junk dealer?
- Would you stop that and sit down?
- Oh, shut up.
Sit down.
You have to forgive my father.
He was making a little joke.
I know.
I'm sure that toothache isn't letting him think about much else.
Listen, honey.
I don't have no toothache all the time.
Say, what you doing tonight?
- Didn't I tell you to stop it?
- I'm talking to her, not you.
Excuse me.
Mr. Sanford, how long have you had this trouble?
Ever since he was born.
I'm warning you, Pop.
I was talking about the pain you're having.
That's what I'm talking about.
My son, the pain.
Would you stop it?
Your tooth, Mr. Sanford.
How long has it been giving you trouble?
It's been giving me trouble a couple of days, but it's all right now.
- So I guess we can go, huh?
- No, we can't.
Now sit down.
You can go in now.
We'll complete your card after the dentist is finished.
Right this way, please.
- Go ahead and ask her.
- I beg your pardon?
Nothing.
My father was just wondering who his dentist was gonna be.
It'll be someone good.
We have an excellent staff here.
No, what I mean is, where do these dentists come from?
Most from around here in California.
But we do have a few from other countries.
Canada, Mexico.
Africa?
Why do you always have to do stuff like that?
Sit in this chair, Mr. Sanford.
What we gonna do, eat now?
This is just a little protection.
The dentist will be with you in just a moment.
Did you hear that?
Just for protection.
It's for blood.
- Stop.
It is not.
- It is.
See?
They butcher your mouth, then you lean over here and bleed in this sink.
And when it's finished draining out ya, there you are, dead.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I'm dead.
Here you go, Mr. Sanford.
All right, if you will open, please?
Doc, wait.
My tooth don't hurt no more, honest.
My tooth don't hurt no more.
- Let's look anyway.
Open, please.
- You're the dentist here, huh?
Yes, I am.
Will you open, please?
- How long you been a dentist?
- Quite some time.
Did you go to school or take a correspondence course.
You'll have to forgive my father, Doctor.
He's a little nervous.
I understand.
But, Mr. Sanford, in order for me to know what I have to know so I can get down to business, you will have to open.
Until I know what I have to know, the business stays closed.
All right.
I think I know what your problem is.
Excuse me, please.
What is wrong with you?
You just insulted that man.
He's obviously a qualified dentist or he wouldn't be with the title "doctor.
" I'm ashamed of you, Pop.
Okay.
You got the shame, he got the title but this is my mouth.
If you don't wanna get your tooth fixed, get up and leave.
Okay, I will leave here.
I don't need this.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Aha.
Here we go.
Excuse me a minute while I wash up.
See the difference between him and that other guy right away?
Yeah, it's like night and day.
I ain't talking about that.
I'm talking about washing his hands.
I like that.
Listen.
Humming, singing.
Happy and humming.
Now, Mr. Sanford.
Let's have a look and see what the problem is.
Anything you say, Doc.
I bet your father's a dentist too.
Where'd you all go to school, Harvard?
No, my father's not a dentist.
He's an electrician.
Actually, I got started in dentistry through a correspondence course.
What?
I got started that way.
Then, of course, I went on to a university.
Oh.
And then you went to Harvard.
No, I went to night school at City College.
Open, please.
That's ugly.
Mr. Sanford, this is a little more complicated than I thought.
Would you excuse me a minute?
I want to check this out very carefully.
Were you happy with that joker?
He sounds terrific.
City College at night.
You heard him, didn't you?
He's gonna check it out.
Business.
These people are all business.
I don't care anymore.
I just want to get this over with and get out of here.
Mr. Sanford, that tooth is in a tricky position and you should be in the best possible hands.
I've asked Dr. Rogers to take over.
He's the head of oral surgery.
Hello, brother.
Now, Mr. Sanford, if you'll open your mouth nice and wide so I can get your foot out first.
Open your mouth.
- Morning, son.
- Morning, Pop.
- Your tooth feel okay today?
- Great.
They do good work at the clinic.
Hey, I hope you learned something from that, Pop.
When something is wrong with you, you go to a doctor or a dentist.
It doesn't matter who he is or where he comes from.
- Let science take care of it.
- I couldn't agree with you more.
That's right.
This is 1972.
All of those old home remedies were from way back when man didn't know better.
Yeah, that's that old-time stuff.
What is this?
It's from the telephone company.
"Due to an error in last month's billing we are enclosing a refund in the amount of $5.25".
- A refund for me?
- That's right.
- Then it's true.
It's true, isn't it?
- What's true?
You know that tooth I had pulled?
They say if you sleep with a pulled tooth up under your pillow that the good fairy will bring you some money.
So you are the good fairy.
So, give me my money, good fairy.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Hey, Pop, I'm home!
Oh.
Hello, son.
I didn't hear the truck pull in.
- You was just going at it, huh?
- Yeah.
All day long.
Yeah.
No wonder they say a woman's work is never done.
- You're like the woman of the house.
- That's me.
- You're also the liar of the house.
- What?
I wonder why that sofa's so warm.
You haven't, by any chance, been sleeping on the sofa again?
Who, me, sleeping?
No, I've been working.
I've been cleaning and vacuuming and coordinating.
I've been coordinating my off.
Then how come that sofa's so warm?
I guess the cat was sitting on it.
- We don't have a cat.
- The one from next door.
He usually come over and keep me company because it get lonesome here sometimes.
Wonder if he's still here.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- Why don't you stop?
Okay, so I laid down for a few minutes.
Will you just stop picking on me all the time?
I'm just trying to figure out what it is you do around here.
I know what I did today.
What did you do?
Anything.
Name it.
- And no lying?
- No lying.
If you tell the truth, I'll give you five dollars.
- Now, that's a deal.
- Did you clean up the yard?
No.
Give me five bucks.
- Why?
- You said You said you'd pay five bucks for the truth.
You think you're slick.
I don't have time to talk 'cause I got things to do.
What do you mean you got things to do?
- That's right.
- Like what kind of things?
I got some people coming over here tonight.
What do you have?
Clam dip.
What do you do with this?
- What do you think you do with it?
- Dip clams in it.
No, you dip these corn chips in it.
Why don't they call it "corn chip dip" instead of"clam dip," dummy?
What's this stuff for?
I got some people coming over to play poker tonight.
Oh, yeah?
Poker, is that what you're gonna play?
- Well, not in my house.
- Are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
You know what your mother called cards?
Fifty-two devils in Satan's army.
Oh, come on.
That's right.
You don't believe me?
Let me show you something.
- I gotta get this thing - Just come in here with me.
- I've gotta get the clam dip.
- Come with me.
- I wanna fix the clam dip.
- Just wait a minute.
- Now, what is this?
- It's a deck of cards.
Deck of cards.
Had 'em 25 years and never opened 'em.
Know why?
Your mother made me swear on this unopened deck I wouldn't play cards no more.
"Don't play cards," she said.
Then she died.
I thought you told me Mom's last words were, "Take care of Lamont.
" - Well, she said that too.
- Well, which was it?
Well, she said both of'em.
- Do you wanna know her last words?
- Yeah.
What was it?
Here what she said.
See, she was in the hospital bed and the doctor was taking me to her bedside, and he whispered to me.
He said, "The end is near, Mr. Sanford.
" And I looked down at your mother, and she said "Fred, if you or Lamont ever get sick again don't use this doctor.
" And then she died.
- That must have been terrible, Pop.
- It was terrible.
I had to walk out the room with that doctor.
Your mother was a fine woman, but she just hated gambling.
The only reason that Mom hated gambling was because you were a lousy cardplayer.
- You were always losing.
- Listen.
Don't say that to me.
Didn't you always get everything you needed?
You was the first kid in the neighborhood who had a gold tooth.
I was also the first kid in the block to get ringworm.
It cleared up with Glover's Mange, didn't it?
You had plenty to eat and a roof over your head.
I also had a stocking cap over my head.
Listen.
Who's coming here anyhow?
Just some guys I know.
One of them is Arthur Matthews's son.
- Arthur Matthews's son?
- That's right.
The Arthur Matthews?
Ugly Arthur Matthews's son?
- That's right.
His son Skeeter.
- Skeeter Matthews?
- He been in jail.
- So what?
Who hasn't?
Well, I haven't.
And you haven't.
Why are you gonna fool around with them jailbirds for?
- Who else is coming?
- Just some guys I met at the poolroom.
There's Rooster and Hucklebuck.
Rooster and Hucklebuck.
I know what a rooster does, but what does a hucklebuck do?
Hucklebuck is in used cars, Pop.
He buys and sells.
You sure he doesn't steal and repaint?
- You asked me, so I told you.
- So, you're gonna play poker with a jailbird, a car thief and a rooster.
- Good luck.
- I've played before.
I know the game.
- You ever play with them?
- Yeah.
Once.
- How much did you win?
- How did you know I won?
It's the oldest trick in the business.
They set a sucker up, let him win a few games then they set him up again, then next time they take everything he got.
Don't worry about it, Pop, okay?
They're not gonna take me.
I've played these guys before and I can play 'em again.
You don't have to worry about it.
Anyway, I don't wanna talk about it because those guys are gonna be here any minute.
I want you to help me straighten this place up, okay?
Take that out.
Let me tell you.
You know that old saying: A fool and his money are soon parted.
Well, it won't be long now, fool.
If you don't like the idea of me playing poker here, don't watch.
- You can go upstairs and go to bed.
- I'm gonna stay and watch.
And every time I see 'em do something fishy, I'm gonna give you a signal.
That's what I'm gonna do.
Give you a signal.
Here.
Now, all you gotta do is watch me with this.
I'm warning you now, Pop, you better not do nothing tonight to embarrass me.
- I ain't gonna say another word.
- Good.
- I'll stay out of it.
- Perfect.
- I'll keep quiet.
- Thank you.
You'll lose your shirt.
I thought you said you wasn't gonna say nothing else.
Now, there's the guys.
Remember what I told you, Pop.
You go let 'em in, and I'm gonna go upstairs and get my money.
Rooster and Hucklebuck and Skeeter.
What a bunch of crooks.
- Hey, old man, how you doing?
- Hey, man, what's going on?
This is some place you got here.
They got as much stuff in here as they got outdoors.
- You must be Rooster.
- No.
I'm Hucklebuck.
Oh.
Then you gotta be Rooster 'cause I bet all my money I know who you are.
You Skeeter Matthews.
You look just like your father Ugly I mean, Arthur Matthews.
You're a card, Pop.
You must be Papa Sanford.
No, I'm Mama Cass.
He something else, ain't he?
- Hey!
- Lamont, how you doing?
- Shall we get to the game?
- Yeah!
Ain't nothing like friends getting together for a friendly game of poker.
You're gonna try to do it to us again, huh, Louis?
- It's Lamont.
- Yeah.
Right.
Here.
We'll play with these.
I just picked them up at the drugstore.
- You don't mind playing with my cards?
- No, I don't mind.
- What's the matter with you?
- There's bugs around here.
There's no bugs in here.
Would you get away from the table?
There's bugs in the house.
Brother, you gonna give us a chance to win back that 15 bucks you won from us?
- Hey, that's possible.
- Hey, I got a great idea.
Why don't we make it very interesting?
Let's raise the stakes from last time.
No, no, no.
Keep it down.
You start raising the stakes, you take the fun out of it.
When you take the fun out of it, you start losing friends.
Right, Lester?
It's Lamont.
- Yeah.
Right.
- Let's raise 'em just a little bit.
Yeah, man, get a little excitement in the game.
- No, no.
I'm against it.
- Yeah, me too.
Hey, what's the matter?
You're scared you're gonna lose a few bucks?
No, that ain't it.
This man invited us in his house.
We're guests here.
- Right.
Y'all ain't nothing but guests.
- Well, let's ask him.
You don't wanna keep it down to a penny ante game, do ya?
- That does seem kind of small.
- Not to me.
Okay.
Well, look, partner.
I mean, it's up to you.
You wanna raise the stakes, we'll raise 'em.
You tell us.
You're the host.
- Okay, we'll raise 'em.
- Yeah, that sounds good.
What are you hitting me for?
- What's going on?
- There's a bug or something.
- I must have missed him.
- Oh, man.
Then it's two bits to open and table stakes.
- Right.
- First ace deals.
Hey, it's my deal, huh?
What are you doing, Pop?
What you got?
Aces, full of nines.
- I'm gone.
- Four deuces.
That's a shame.
Four threes.
You lose.
Stick with it though, Leonard.
You'll win a hand soon.
- It's Lamont.
- Yeah.
Right.
You're really not doing too good, Lamont.
- You must be lucky in love.
- Oh, yeah.
He got a lot of girls.
All over town.
Call him Sweet Lips Lamont, the dummy Don Juan.
Go back in the kitchen.
You're not exactly bringing me any luck out here.
You think I'm jinxing you?
Did you win anything while I was out?
Well, play, dummy.
Say, Pop, would you do me a favor?
Would you just get away from me?
Go do something, all right?
Yeah, I'll fix me a nightcap.
- Ante up, Rooster.
- All right, I'm in.
- Hey!
- Gettin' it on.
Look at him.
Doing one of those old-timer's dances.
Would you turn that thing off?
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
What are you trying to do, Pop, blast us out of here?
I can't play cards.
I can't even watch you play.
I can't play the radio.
I can't dance.
What can I do?
Why don't you go upstairs and go to bed?
I ain't sleepy.
Go upstairs, go to bed.
I know what I'll do.
I'll fix something to drink.
- Yeah, how about a Scotch?
- Scotch?
- That sounds good to me.
- Me too.
Coming up.
Three Scotches.
Coming up.
All righty, this gonna cost you a dollar there, Huck.
I'll raise you two.
- Another two.
- All right, I'll stay.
I call.
Well, bottom's up.
What's the matter with you?
He can't drink all of that.
Get it off the table.
It's a quarter to three threes No one in the place Has got less than these So throw 'em in, Joe This little story can save you some dough So throw 'em in, Joe Throw them in, Joe Say, Pop, would you stop it?
Go out in the kitchen and get yourself some applejack and take it upstairs and go to bed.
- We're trying to play here.
- I told you I wasn't sleepy.
Bye.
I'm sorry, fellas, but you know how it is when they get to be that age.
- They start acting weird.
- Like my old man, about the same age.
You ought to do what I did.
I got him a television set for his bedroom.
I haven't seen him since 1968.
That's not such a bad idea.
- What's going on with the lights?
- Hey, Pop!
- Excuse me.
- How are we gonna play in the dark?
We're gonna play.
Lights went out, didn't it?
Yeah, and I think I know who did it.
- Who?
- You.
- Who, me?
- No, the switch fell down all by itself.
Well, I'll call the light company and have them fix it in the morning.
Hey, man, the lights are back on.
Come on and play, huh?
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to break up this card game.
- Let's get the game on, huh?
- All right, here I come.
- Leave us alone.
Quit bothering us.
- Well, listen, Lamont.
They're gonna take you for everything you've got.
I'm telling you, they cheatin'.
Would you leave us alone, Pop?
Please leave us alone.
And stay here in the kitchen.
That's right.
Stay here in the kitchen.
Don't come through this kitchen door.
You got that?
I'm sorry, fellas.
It was a fuse.
I put a penny in.
It's all right now.
- It's all right.
- So where were we?
- How many cards you want?
- Okay.
Give me one.
It's gonna cost you six bucks.
- All right.
Rooster.
- Give me three, Skeeter.
- Three.
Okay.
You?
- Two.
All right.
I'll play with these.
I don't know who that could be.
Excuse me, fellas.
I don't know what's going on.
We're gonna play this game.
What are you doing out here?
You told me don't come through the kitchen door.
Let me see that hand.
Listen, Lamont.
This is a sucker's hand.
Don't play this hand.
Don't play no hand they deal you.
- I'm telling you, they cheatin'.
- You already told me that, Pop.
Would you just leave us alone so we could play?
Take a walk or something.
Okay, dummy.
Before this game, you was just a plain dummy.
But after tonight, you'll be a broke dummy.
Thank you and good night.
- Hey, fellas, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
- Let's get to the game.
- It's 16 bucks if you wanna stay.
- He raised it eight.
- Okay.
Sixteen dollars - Again, man?
What is it?
- Excuse me.
We're playing.
Didn't I tell you - Hey, I'm sorry, man.
- We understand.
We understand.
It's all right.
Sixteen bucks if you wanna stay.
Sixteen bucks.
Excuse me, men.
We'll get this game.
Don't worry about it.
- Hello.
- Lamont, listen.
Don't play that hand.
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.
We'll play.
We'll play.
Dummy.
- Sorry, men.
- Sure.
Sure.
Listen.
Are you guys hungry?
There's some food on the sideboard.
- Let's just play on out this hand.
- Let's play this game.
- Now, it was up to me, right?
- Right.
- How much do I have to put up?
- Sixteen dollars.
Sixteen dollars.
Right.
Okay.
How did you get upstairs?
You know how easy it is climbing through that second-floor window?
We gotta get that fixed.
Any burglar could climb right in like I did.
- Leave him alone.
Let's play.
- Put your money where your mouth is.
Stay away from the table, Pop.
Don't come near this table.
All right.
You're gonna put up Don't do it.
- Sixteen bucks if you wanna see me.
- Don't do it.
Don't do it.
- I'll call you.
- All right.
- Full house.
- I got a flush.
- Straight flush.
- Flush is right.
Your money going right down the toilet.
Well, that's it for me.
That cleans me out.
That's a good balance, ain't it?
Nothing in your pocket and nothing in your head.
- That's about it then, huh?
- Yeah, we might as well split.
Too bad.
Say, wait a minute, fellas.
Why don't you wait around and have a beer?
Would you have a beer?
No, it's getting kind of late.
Oh, you can take time out for a beer.
You just don't wanna win and run, do you?
- All right, we'll have a beer.
- That's good.
Hey, Lamont, go down to the store and get a couple of six-packs.
- What am I supposed to use for money?
- Here.
Take this.
Take the truck, in case you have to try to find a store that's open.
Fellas, you think you got time for a few more hands?
- Play?
With you?
- You?
Lamont won't let me play.
Maybe we can get a few hands in before he gets back.
No, no.
I think the stakes are a little too high for you, Papa Sanford.
I got money now.
Wait a minute.
Look here.
I got money.
Safe.
Door.
Combination.
Open.
Shoe box.
Top.
Mason jar.
Sock.
Woolite.
Mint government.
Is that enough?
- Maybe we do have time for a few.
- Your money's good.
I hope you fellas don't mind playing with a new deck.
See, I got an unopened deck I had for over 25 years.
My wife made me swear I wouldn't play.
So I figure since this is the first time I've played since she passed that it'd be good to play with that deck.
You mean you haven't played cards for over 25 years?
Right.
And please forgive a old man.
I'll get my glasses 'cause I don't see too well and I don't wanna make no mistakes.
Yeah, right here.
Still unopened.
Wait.
I hope you'll be patient with a old fellow, but how do you play again?
Fellas, where you going?
I got the beer.
- You're not leaving, are you?
- See you later, Lucas!
It's Lamont!
Pop, what happened to the fellas?
I thought Come on over here, son.
Try on some of this stuff.
I'm sure some of it will fit you.
- Were you playing cards with them?
- That's right.
That's impossible.
I wasn't gone long enough for you to win all of this stuff.
You was gone long enough for me.
It didn't Let me see how long you was gone.
Yeah, you were gone long enough for me to beat them crooks.
You know that Skeeter Matthews?
He was dealing off the bottom.
Three-finger drag with the thumb on top.
Oldest trick in the business.
If they were cheating, how did you win?
I had my own deck, son.
Look here.
Let me show you.
- Now, what you see?
- It's three cards faced down.
Okay.
Now look through these.
Eight of hearts six of clubs, three of diamonds.
Hey, Pop, you're slick, you know that?
You really did it to 'em.
They did it to you.
I always believe by going by what it say in the Bible.
What?
Deal unto others as they have dealt unto thee.
You got a whole lot of money.
Pop, can you let me have ten dollars?
Where you going all dressed up?
Hey, I got a date.
I called up Sheila.
I'm going out.
- Are you kidding?
This time of night?
- Yep.
Ain't no way no girl gonna give you no date this late.
Are you serious?
I already called her.
I called her up and she said okay.
The only thing she's waiting for is for me to call and tell her I'm on my way.
Hello, Sheila.
Hey, this is Lamont.
Yeah, I know I'm late, but I had to change my clothes and do my mustache.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Well, how about ten?
Five.
Well, how about if I meet you at the Hello?
Hello?
Well, Mustache first ace deals.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
- Hey, Pop.
- Shh, shh, shh.
What are you watching that for?
Don't you ever get tired of that?
I watch what I wanna watch.
I'm grown.
You're grown, all right.
You watch vampire movies and then you have to sleep with the light on.
Show you what you know.
It's not a vampire movie.
It's a werewolf movie.
Oh.
That's different.
Somebody in there looks like the girl I went with before I met your mother.
Who, that white woman there?
No, dummy.
Wolfman.
Look at that.
There he is.
Look.
Same little beady eyes.
Same little beady, bloodshot eyes.
Same kind of hair: Short.
You know, her hair wasn't that long.
Ugly woman.
Pop, if she was so ugly, what were you doing with her?
Son, she was ugly, but Lord knows that woman could cook.
She out-cooked Julia Child.
She out-cooked the Galloping Gourmet.
She out-cooked my mother Mary.
She could cook.
I remembered many times we'd be sitting on the couch.
Lights were low.
Music was soft.
Glenn Miller.
See, I forget all the words.
I'd be sitting there and I'd put my arm around her.
Comfortable.
And I'd look her right in the face.
I'd say, "Gee whiz, why don't you get up and cook something"?
See, look at that.
You made me miss the end of the movie.
You was telling me a story, Pop.
Yeah, I like to reminisce like that some What are you doing all dressed up?
You got company coming?
I don't need none of your rowdy friends here keeping me from getting my sleep.
Don't worry.
You'll get your sleep because I'm going out.
- Out?
Out?
- Out.
Is there an echo in here?
You're gonna leave me here all by myself in this house, in this neighborhood, in my poor condition?
The answer to all four questions is "yes.
" Well, what if a burglar breaks in?
They've been breaking in around here, night and day.
Yeah, I wish somebody would break in here and take some of this junk.
It's nothing to be kidding about.
I won't be able to go to sleep knowing that you ain't here.
Okay, why don't you make a nice, hot whiskey toddy?
That'll help you sleep.
That won't help me sleep.
Hot whiskey toddy'll keep me up.
Then make yourself a warm glass of milk.
Warm milk makes me burp.
Okay, then why don't you drink a glass of vinegar and suck on a green lemon?
- Will that help me sleep?
- No.
It'll draw your jaws up tight.
You won't be able to open your big mouth.
You sure are cold and heartless, you know that?
What if you came back home and found out I was dead?
If I die, I'm gonna come back and haunt you.
- You'll probably be good at it too.
- Yeah.
One night when you least expect it a 65-year-old ghost will jump out behind you and wrap his harp around your skull.
- Who you going out with?
- Rollo.
You mean Rita Lawson's son Rollo?
- That's the one.
- When did he get out of jail?
Say, Pop, why are you always running my friends down?
Who told you Rollo was in jail?
- Sam Turner told me.
- Sam Turner?
How would he know?
Were they cellmates?
Sam Turner told me that his daughter told him that her daughter told her that - Hey, what's happening, Rollo?
- What's up, cool breeze?
- Hey, Pops.
- Don't call me Pops.
Hey, Rollo, you look very hip, buddy.
Yeah, and these are just my slumming clothes.
Yeah, I saw a suit like that in the pawnshop over in the slums.
Wrong, Pops.
No, Pops, this suit was tailor-made by a gentleman's tailor.
Yeah, wait till the gentleman find out his suit is missing.
Hey, Pop.
Would you dig yourself?
Rollo's a guest in our house.
It's okay, dude.
I appreciate your old man's sense of humor.
And, Pops, just to show that there's no hard feelings have a cigar.
You didn't mix none of that Mexican parsley in here, did you?
Wrong again, Pops.
A pal of mine in the navy got that out of Cuba.
Hand-rolled.
Yeah.
A sailor friend of yours rolled a Cuban for his cigar.
Hey, Rollo, listen.
We better split 'cause it's about time to go.
Yeah, all them good-looking sisters be taken by the time we get there.
Why don't y'all take me down there where they got them good-looking sisters?
Hey, Pops, I'm sorry, but you're just a little bit too old.
This is a place just for the brothers and the sisters.
Can't y'all take me and put me where they got the mamas and the papas?
- You hear what he said?
- Forget it, Pop.
Come on, Rollo.
You leave me here by myself, you're gonna have some bad luck.
Why don't you watch some more TV or go to sleep?
What do you mean watch TV?
I ain't gonna be able to watch nothing.
I ain't gonna be able to close my eyes and that's the way you'll find me when you get back here sitting up here with my eyes wide open.
I ain't gonna go to sleep.
How can you go to sleep in a place like this?
Nobody here but you.
Television.
Ain't nothing on here.
I wish Dracula was on tonight.
Yeah, it's impossible to go A war movie.
Gee whiz.
Nobody can go to sleep with a war movie on.
That you, Lamont?
Help!
Help!
It's a robber!
Help!
It's a burglar!
Help!
It's a burglar!
I got him!
I got him!
Give me the baseball bat!
- Pop, you've got Rollo!
- What's wrong with you, Pops?
Ain't nothing the matter with me.
When I'm being robbed, I grab the nearest throat.
He might still be in the yard.
You okay, Rollo?
- Yeah, man.
- Hey, look at this.
Stuff from the house.
There really was a burglar.
I told you there was a burglar in here.
I told you if you left me by myself, something bad was gonna happen.
What was you doing while he was ripping the house off?
What do you mean what was I doing?
I was helpless.
You mean you were asleep.
Sleep?
I was unconscious.
The burglar knocked me out.
Knocked you out?
Yeah.
I didn't come to until I heard you drive up.
- Wait a minute.
Let me see.
Maybe he - He hit me with something soft.
You mean to tell me he knocked you out with something soft?
Yeah.
It felt like a soft gun.
See, they're making the handle now with the rubber in them.
It's a good thing we came home when we did.
Help me get this stuff back in the house, Rollo.
Yeah, help him, Rollo.
I can't lift that.
Every time we go someplace I told you though, didn't I?
I told you it was some burglars out there just waiting to jump on a poor, defenseless old man.
Hey, man, look.
The dude The dude dropped his gun.
What?
A gun?
I could've been shot.
I could've been shot.
This is a bad one.
Hey, what's the matter with you, Pop?
Why are you so surprised about seeing a gun?
- You said he hit you with it.
- I didn't say I saw it.
I felt it.
This is some souvenir he left us.
We didn't have a gun in the house before, but we got one now.
Don't wave that thing around me and get it out of this house.
Would you like me to take it to the Lost and Found?
- No.
Give it to the police.
- Why should we give it to the police?
They never gave us nothing.
- Give it to me.
I'll take it myself.
- Wait a minute, Pops.
You're making a big mistake taking that to the police station.
Ain't that what you're supposed to do when you find a gun?
Hey, that's what a white person does.
You take that there, they'll charge you with every shooting since Lincoln.
They wouldn't charge me with nothing like that.
You two will vouch for me.
Yeah, we'll vouch for you, every day outside the jail with a big sign that says, "Free Fred Sanford.
" - Come on, Pops.
Be smart.
- Yeah, Pop, be smart.
Put that gun in a drawer, and when the burglars come back, we'll be ready.
No, man.
You don't want that thing around here.
It might have been used in a stickup.
Hey, what you wanna do is to get rid of it, man.
Pawn it.
Hey, man, look here.
- Pawn it?
- Yeah.
This is a Smith & Wesson.
38.
Snub-nosed, blue steel, walnut-grain handle.
And it must be custom-made because it's an eight-shooter, Jack.
I don't want it in this house.
I don't care if it shoots a hundred times and then start throwing bricks.
Hey, Pops, I'm with you.
That's why I say pawn it.
Hey, man, we can at least get a hundred dollars for it.
- Don't put me in it.
- Wait a minute, Pop.
A hundred dollars is a lot of money.
And look at it this way.
The gun won't be in the house, so you don't have to worry about it.
- I think Rollo's right.
- I ain't got nothing to do with it.
When should we take it down?
Tomorrow morning.
Why waste time?
- Good.
You're gonna take it in, right?
- Well No, man.
You see, I actually can't take it in, Jack because all them pawnshop dealers know me and think something shaky was up.
They'd have the law in there before I could turn around and get out of there.
The police are gonna be involved anyway so you might as well give it to 'em.
You don't wanna do that.
If I take this in there, man, they'll interrogate me into bad health.
- You take it.
- I'd like to take it, Rollo but but I'm young.
Yeah.
I'm a young dude.
Ayoung dude coming in there with a gun right away they'd think something was suspicious.
What we gotta do is find a older person somebody that wouldn't cause that much suspicion.
Just a common everyday old man.
- No, no.
Don't look at me.
- Come on, Pop.
I don't want that gun around me.
Get that gun away from me.
I don't wanna have nothing to do Take the gun.
- Pops!
- Oh, this is the big one.
Oh, this is the big one.
You hear that, Elizabeth?
This is my last day of freedom.
I'm coming to join you, honey, with a snub-nose in my hand.
- Hey, Rol.
- Hey, man.
We ready to go?
I am.
I don't know if my pop is.
Man, ain't nothing to it.
He walks into the pawnshop, lays the gun on the counter and gets his money.
Easy.
Yeah, that's easy for you, Rollo, but that's hard for Pop.
Pop, Rollo's here!
Pop!
- What is that thing on your head?
- An ice bag.
What it look like?
It looks like you've been crowned Queen of the May.
What do you need an ice bag for?
'Cause my head is spinning.
I didn't sleep a wink last night just worrying about having a gun here in the house.
You didn't sleep last night, Pop?
Not a wink.
I was up all night.
- That cricket must've kept you awake.
- What cricket?
The one that was up in your room doing all the snoring.
You don't think so?
Well, I was up all night worrying about all this crazy business.
- I said get that gun outta the house.
- Don't start that again.
We agreed to take it to the pawnshop.
And we also agreed that you'd be the one to take it in there.
Who agreed?
I didn't.
You did.
All right, we'll take a vote on it.
All those in favor of Fred Sanford taking the gun into the pawnshop signify by saying "aye.
" - Aye!
- Aye!
Oppose?
- The ayes have it.
You take the gun in.
- Wait a minute.
- What's the matter now?
- I want a recount.
- Get the gun.
Where's the gun?
- I'll get the gun.
Just get the gun so we can pawn it, please.
A suitcase?
You mean to tell me you put the gun in a suitcase?
I ain't gonna walk down the street with no gun in my hand.
This is not Dodge City and I'm not Marshal Dillon.
Would you please remove the gun from the suitcase?
Yeah, Pops, the gun will rattle in there.
My hands will rattle worse.
Take the gun out of the suitcase.
I see you packed a box lunch, but where's the gun?
In the box.
In case we was stopped and searched, no one would suspect anything.
If somebody opened the suitcase and found a Thom McAn shoe box they wouldn't suspect anything?
- Forget the shoe box, Pop.
- I don't want this.
You take it.
- Don't give it to me.
- Man, I can't do it.
Well, I don't want it.
All right.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll throw it out the window.
All those in favor of Fred Sanford throwing the gun out the window signify by saying "aye.
" - Aye.
The ayes have it.
- Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, Jack.
Look here.
Why don't you put the gun in your pants pocket?
What if it went off accidentally?
It could shoot my foot off.
I'll never be able to dance again.
Put the gun in your pocket, okay?
I'll put it in here, but See there?
That's a bad omen.
That means something bad's gonna happen.
Move outta the way, Rollo.
All that means is that you've got a hole in your pocket.
Well, then we're a good set.
Me with a hole in my pocket and you with a hole in your head.
Then why don't you sew up the hole in your pocket?
I will if you'll plug up the hole in your head.
Wait.
I got an idea.
- Why don't we just stick it in here?
- Wait a minute.
Watch that.
And no one would be the wiser.
And when the sweater's all buttoned up yes, sir!
Everything is everything.
Come on.
Let's split, man!
Wait a minute now.
Wait.
This will not work.
Look at that bulge.
Don't worry about that.
You can't tell the gun bulge from your bulge.
Wait a minute.
I got a bad feeling about this.
- I got a bad feeling.
- Pop, don't worry about it.
You don't have no bad feeling about it.
We're gonna take care of everything.
Just don't worry about nothing.
You understand that?
Now, listen to this, Pop.
When we get to the pawnshop, I want you to ask for a hundred dollars.
You're not gonna take nothing less than a hundred dollars.
I don't wanna go down there 'cause we're gonna be arrested.
We're gonna get Do you know how old I'll be when I get out of jail?
Ain't nothing sadder than a 95-year-old ex-convict.
Oh, come on.
I don't know.
I just can't decide which one I like.
I don't know though.
This one seems This one's good too.
But then that ring is That one's a little big for me, I think.
Maybe Yeah, I'll take this one.
Yeah.
I'll take this one, sir.
- That's $13.
- Thirteen dollars.
Thank you.
Yes, sir, can I help you?
Say, this is a pawnshop, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
- I thought it was a pawnshop.
I was walking down the street, and I said, "Gee whiz, that's a pawnshop" and I came in here.
You got a lot of nice stuff here.
Is this your pawnshop?
Yes.
Are you interested in anything in particular?
I'm interested in everything.
Everything.
Yeah, see, I'm sort of a collector, and you got a bunch of nice stuff.
- A collector?
- Yeah, see, I'm the inside man and my son, he's the outside man.
You and your son work together.
Yeah, that's right.
But I'm the brains of the outfit, and he's the wheel man.
Oh, he's the wheel man?
Yeah, he's the wheel man.
He does pretty good on his own too.
Like last night he brought home a bunch of stuff.
- Made a killing in Beverly Hills.
- He did?
Yeah.
Well, listen.
Let's stop all the kidding around and get down to the real business at hand.
Now, I got this gun, see?
Yes, I see.
And it's in pretty fair working condition.
So what I want is a hundred dollars.
- A hundred dollars?
- Yeah.
- Well, I can't give you that much.
- What's taking you so long?
- What's going on?
- Is this dude giving you trouble?
No, he just said that he couldn't give us a hundred dollars.
- Well, how much?
- Well, how about 50?
- We'll take it.
- Pop, you can do better than that.
- Yeah, get it up, man.
- Seventy-five?
- We'll take it.
- Pop, would you stay out of this?
- A hundred dollars.
- I don't carry that much cash on me.
Sometimes I got nothing in my pocket.
- We'll take it.
- What?
I'm trying to get $100.
- Nobody move!
Freeze!
- Get your hands on the counter!
- Great day in the morning.
- It's a stickup.
- Swanny.
- Mr. Sanford.
- Hey, brother.
What's going on?
- What's going on?
We got a call to investigate an armed robbery at this location.
That's right.
I was being held up by these men.
Do you know them?
Held up?
Are you kidding?
You had this gun pointed right at me and you were demanding money.
How would you like to explain that?
How would you like one across your lip?
Wait a minute.
Let's get this straight.
You were being held up by these three men?
Is that what you said?
Wait a minute, Smitty.
I don't know what he's talking about because all we did was come in here to pawn this gun that we found.
- You found that gun?
- Yeah.
Last night.
We surprised a burglar when we came home early.
He dropped it as he ran out.
The failure to report a breaking and entering and to relinquish a firearm to the authorities constitute felonious acts.
However, since you have no criminal records we'll nullify the usual accusatory procedures.
We're not gonna bust you.
See, I told you to turn it in.
No.
But you wanted to keep it.
And this dummy here wanted to pawn it.
The reason I'm here between you dummies, trying to sell it to this dummy.
Well, we'll just take this down to headquarters.
And if something like that happens again, call us.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay, man.
- Right up.
- On.
- On.
- If you listened to me - Would you just wait a minute?
Wait a minute.
Say, excuse me.
Now you know we're not trying to hold you up, how much would you have given?
Well, you see, I was just stalling you.
Under other conditions, I would have given you a hundred dollars.
Did you hear that?
A hundred dollars.
- I knew you was gonna mess this up.
- Why you screaming at me for?
We ain't got no money now.
You're always doing stuff to mess things up.
Hey, listen.
You pay a lot of money for stuff, don't you?
- Sometimes.
- Are you interested in guns?
That depends.
Well, look, see, I got a World War I rifle.
It's my own.
I used it when I was fighting side by side with Sgt.
York.
See, Sergeant York didn't capture all them Germans by himself.
I was there, but I was in the back, bringing up the rear, as usual.
And it's got his initials on it.
S.A.Y. Sergeant Alvin York.
And you say that you still have this gun?
I got it and it's a collector's item.
How much will you give me for it?
If it's authentic, I may give you $150.
- $150?
- Yes.
I'll take it.
I'll take it.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
I'll bring it and I'll bring it.
I'll sell it.
I'll sell it.
And as for your friend Rollo, I never wanna see him again.
- Did you hear that?
- I heard.
I heard.
Him and his smart ideas.
Pawn the gun.
We could've been shot in the back.
Do you realize that?
Right now you could be laying there with a bullet hole in your pants and beyond.
It's a good thing that them cops were our friends.
If they had been some strange cops, they could've shot us dead.
Would you stop it?
We didn't do anything that wrong.
If anybody had taken a shot at us, they'd be sorry.
They'd be sorry, all right.
They'd just add an apology to the eulogy.
- I don't wanna talk about it anymore.
- I don't wanna talk about it either.
- I gotta get my rifle.
- You gotta get what?
Get in here and find my rifle.
- The pawnbroker said he'd give me $150.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Say, my rifle is gone.
- Wait a minute.
So is the television.
- Huh?
- Here's a note.
Don't say that.
"To whom it may concern: In my haste to leave last night I inadvertently dropped my pistol.
A subsequent search of this house on my part during your absence turned up no pistol but several other interesting articles such as your TV set, radio camera, rifle numerous pairs of glasses, silverware, china - My long drawers?
- Long underwear " Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Let me see.
42 across.
Perry Mason's secretary.
Della blank.
Her name wasn't Della Blank.
I know that, Melvin.
The blank is where her name goes.
- Della what?
- Maybe it was Della Mason.
What's wrong with you, Melvin?
They weren't married.
Although I believe - You think so?
- Sure.
You can't see that on TV.
But I bet you at the annual Christmas party that - A little hanky-panky.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Get on to the next one.
- Okay, then.
There it goes again.
How is a man supposed to think with all that noise going on?
- What is that, Fred?
- Some guy bought the place next door.
No kidding.
That place has been vacant for years.
Everybody in the neighborhood been throwing all their trash there.
I know it.
I been going over there, picking it up, cleaning it up and selling it back to 'em.
Now I can't do that no more.
Fred, what's he making over there anyway?
He ain't making nothing but a bunch of noise, and I'm gonna tell him.
Hey, you!
You better cut that noise down if you don't want some trouble!
Don't have me come over there and give you a bunch of trouble, buddy and I mean it 'cause I'll be over there on you!
- Now, that's telling him, Fred.
- Yeah.
See, you got to nip them things in the bud.
Nip 'em in the bud.
That bud is nipped.
I think that bud needs a little more nipping.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna get my bud nipper and nip some bud.
- What's a bud nipper?
- I'll show you what a bud nipper is.
Here it is.
My Louisville bud nipper.
- How all those dents get in there?
- That's from nipping buds.
Move out the way.
I'm gonna teach this guy Where are you going with that?
I'm going over there and introduce myself to our new neighbor and then open up his skull.
- What are you talking about?
- This guy been over there three days.
- This noise is driving me crazy.
- Would you get inside?
Give me this bat.
Now, get inside.
What's the matter with you, Pop?
You can't go beating up on somebody just 'cause they making noise.
There.
It stopped.
- Who bought that place anyway?
- Some stupid jerk, that's who.
What are you calling him that for?
You don't even know him.
I met him and he's a nice guy.
I think he'll make us a good neighbor.
- Is he a brother?
- No, but what difference does it make?
Well, it make a whole lot of difference to me.
Haven't you seen that bumper sticker, "Good neighbors come in all colors"?
He'll come in all colors too if I put my bud nipper up his head.
- When did you meet him anyway?
- I met him yesterday.
I introduced myself and he invited me in his house.
- He's a good cook.
- You ate there?
That's right.
He gave me a dish of some stuff that was terrific.
It's called mofongo.
Mofongo?
If someone gave me mofongo, I'd sprinkle some foot powder on it.
Well, that shows what you know.
That's a national dish.
He's Puerto Rican.
Melvin, did you hear what Lamont said?
He said the guy that moved next door is Puerto Rican.
That's it.
That's it.
There goes the neighborhood.
- What?
- This was a good neighborhood but now all the property values gonna go What difference does it make if he's Puerto Rican?
Makes a big difference.
The Puerto Ricans run down every neighborhood they get into.
Look what they did to Harlem.
- What did they do to Harlem?
- What did they do to it?
Listen.
Before the Puerto Ricans moved in to Harlem, it was a paradise.
- Right, Melvin?
- That's right, Fred.
It was a paradise.
Harlem was a ghetto long before Puerto Ricans moved in, and you know it.
I guess it was sort of.
Melvin, you know good and well before the Puerto Ricans moved to Harlem there was not one cockroach in Harlem.
See, they brought 'em there.
See, they Puerto Rican cockroaches.
And they also keep 'em for pets.
Now, I can't argue with that, Lamont.
You don't know what you talking about.
When was the last time you was in Harlem?
- Twenty years ago.
- And how did it look?
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful.
- It was a ghetto.
- Well, you could call it that.
- But beautiful.
- But beautiful.
How can a ghetto be beautiful?
Yeah, Fred.
How can a ghetto be beautiful?
- Shut up, Melvin.
- Please shut up, Melvin.
Look, if you guys don't want my opinion, I'll just shut up.
Good.
Well, I got to go anyway.
I'll see you later.
I'm going on out of here.
Listen, Melvin.
Leave the door open.
The flies ain't been out all day.
Listen.
Don't go telling me about Harlem.
Who you think brought the rats there?
I guess you're gonna tell me that was the Puerto Ricans too.
I sure am.
And they brought 'em there on purpose.
- And why was that?
- To kill the Puerto Rican cockroaches.
See, they sic the rats on the cockroaches.
It's like their national pastime.
You know, like baseball.
- Would you stop it?
- I mean it.
They gather at a big stadium and they stand up and sing their national anthem.
You know what the Puerto Rican national anthem is?
We'll take Manhattan The Bronx and Staten Island too I'm not kidding you.
Them Puerto Ricans gonna take over the whole neighborhood.
There it goes again.
Will you listen to that?
- Gee whiz, I can't - What are you talking about?
- He's only playing his radio.
- Yeah, he's only playing his radio.
But pretty soon this place will be just crawling with Puerto Ricans wearing them pointy-toed shoes and dancing in the street.
I'm gonna call the police because they disturbing the peace.
- They disturbing the peace.
- Wait a minute, Pop.
Wait a minute.
If all that's bothering you is him making noise I'll go over there and ask him to stop.
He probably don't even know he's disturbing you.
I suppose you think you don't ever make noise.
If I do make noise, I'll make it in English.
Listen.
I'm telling you, I know these people, Lamont.
Next thing he be growing a garden over there in his backyard.
And you know what he'd be growing?
Latin lettuce.
- Latin lettuce?
- Yeah.
That's that stuff they use to roll them funny cigarettes.
You know, call 'em south of the border butts.
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.
Let's go and fix my lunch.
- That's what I came home for.
- Okay, okay.
- But you'll listen to me one day.
- You're getting worked up over nothing.
Julio's a nice guy.
He don't want no trouble.
- Julio?
Is that his name?
- That's right.
Julio Fuentes.
Julio Fuentes?
That don't sound like no name.
That sounds like something you get from drinking their water.
I had fuentes once for three days.
You're gonna change your mind aboutJulio once you meet him.
You think so?
Well, I know 'em, and another thing they do is collect cats.
- Cats?
What for?
- To make strings for their guitars.
Pop, just help me fix my lunch and I'll be happy, okay?
Okay.
There's your sandwich.
I'm going upstairs.
Help!
Help!
Lamont!
Lamont, come here!
There's a goat in the living room!
- Get him out of here.
- Just relax.
Now, relax.
That's Chico.
- That's Julio's goat.
He won't hurt you.
- Don't tell me.
I know all about goats, and that's a killer goat.
Look at him.
Look at him.
He's in that attack position.
Don't go near him.
He'll tear your head off.
Chico wouldn't hurt a fly.
I'm not worried if he hurt a fly.
I'm worried if he hurt a old man.
It's a killer goat, huh?
Look at this.
Hello, Chico.
See that, Pop?
- Hey, Julio.
- I'm sorry, man.
That's okay.
Hey, listen at 'em.
They both understand the same language.
Hey.
Hey, señor.
You and el goatay vamoosay right away.
Do you dig?
I'm sorry, man, but I don't understand.
It's nothing.
Julio, my pop, Fred Sanford.
Pop, this is Julio Fuentes.
That's your father.
Señor Mr. Sanford.
I've been looking forward to this.
It's a pleasure.
I'm ain't gonna put my hand on nobody hand's been touching a goat.
You're right.
I'm sorry about the goat, Mr. Sanford.
I always keep him tied up.
I'm sorry.
He must've got loose and got away.
What are you doing with a goat anyway?
Wouldn't they sell you a dog?
Or is that just a Puerto Rican poodle?
No.
I use Chico to keep the place clean, man.
He eats up all the garbage.
Well, I bet over at your place, that's a full-time job.
- Hey, he's only kidding, Julio.
- I'm not kidding.
Next thing you'll know he'll have a yard full of chickens.
What's the matter?
You got something against chickens?
- Not really.
- Maybe you got something against goats.
Well, then maybe, Mr. Sanford, you got something against Puerto Ricans.
Now you got it.
Mr. Sanford, tell me.
What have you got against Puerto Ricans?
Since you asked me, I'll tell you.
First thing, when they came here, they brought them cockroaches with them.
Them Puerto Rican cockroaches.
And then they brought them rats with them.
And now look what you got with you this time a goat.
I'm gonna tell you something, Mr. Sanford.
I would rather live with a young goat who gives milk than an old goat who gives trouble.
Well, how would you like a old goat to give you one across your lips?
You give bad vibes, man.
I'm leaving.
- Good.
Go back to where you came from.
- I come from New York City, man.
- That's where I come from.
- And you messed up Harlem.
Now you're gonna try to louse it up out here.
Go tell it to the United Nations.
I wish you would start some stuff.
Say, look, Julio.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.
He's an old man and he's got a lot of hang-ups.
I don't like the way he talks to me.
I just don't like it.
He talks to me the same way.
He's called me a dummy every day of my life.
Except once.
And that was the day he had laryngitis.
And even then he wrote it on a piece of paper.
That's okay for you to take.
He's your father.
But I don't have to take that.
- People should try to be friends.
- I know that.
He knows it too.
Now, he blows up and he lets off steam and then he realizes he was wrong.
I'll bet since we've been out here talking, he's thought about it - and realized that he's wrong.
- I hope so, man.
We've got to be neighbors.
We may as well be friends.
Lamont, come on in the house.
Stop talking to that goat lover.
See that?
It's the same thing all over again.
- What did you do that for?
- What?
And man comes over here and tries to be friends with you and you practically throw him out of the house.
Well, I don't want him, I don't need him, and I don't like him.
Nobody asked you to like him.
And the more you keep talking, I ain't gonna be too crazy about you either.
And another thing, you had your hands on that goat too.
Would you stop it?
Stop it.
Give me this.
Stop it.
Julio's got just as much right to live here and be a junkman as you have.
Junkman?
Is that what's he's opening next door, a junkyard?
That's right.
He bought the place and he can do whatever he wants.
- Now I know he's gotta go.
- Why?
Why?
You want competition?
Another junkyard?
Well, I don't.
What are you doing?
A guy comes in, brings his goat and then eats stuff off my table and make a whole lot of noise over there, disturbing the peace.
Hello.
Operator?
Get me the police.
You can say adios to your Puerto Rican Marx Brothers Julio, Chico and Mofongo.
Lamont, what's a six-letter word for a TV show starring William Conrad?
- Fink.
- "Fink.
" That's four letters.
That don't fit.
- Well, it fits you perfectly.
- What are you talking about?
About how you reported Julio to the police.
I didn't reportJulio to the police.
I reported Julio's goat to the police.
And when I found out it wasn't illegal to have a goat that's when I reported Julio to the police.
What did you report?
That he was making noise because he's rebuilding or that he was playing his radio and listening to a Spanish station?
I just said that his place was a eyesore.
- A what?
- A eyesore and a mess.
You can do that.
When someone is destroying the beauty of the community, you can report him.
- Are you serious?
- That's what they told me - when I called the building inspector.
- You called the building inspector?
Yeah, I called because I don't want the beauty of my community destroyed.
I don't how you can say that, Pop, living in the middle of this heap.
There are heaps and there are heaps.
This is a coordinated heap.
You're turning against a man because he happens to be from another country.
How would you like it if the guy next door turned against people from Africa?
I don't care, as long as they don't turn against people from St. Louis.
- What's the use?
- Listen.
Wait a minute now.
That's not the reason I don't like him.
The reason I don't like him because he's giving us competition and that's the only reason.
- That's the only reason?
- That's the only reason.
We can't let every Tom, Dick and Chico move in here with their bongo drums.
I'll get it.
Try to tell you, you don't even listen to nobody.
- Hey, Lamont.
- What?
- It's for you.
- Who is it?
- It's your friend, the goat lover.
- Stop calling him that.
- Hey, Julio.
Come on in.
- I'm sorry to bother you, man but I'd like to talk to your father.
Did you hear that?
Julio wants to talk to you.
What's he wanna talk about?
I'm busy.
I got a crossword puzzle waiting for me.
I have decided that maybe you're not such a bad chamaco.
Who you calling a chamaco, you chamaco?
It just means "fellow," that's all.
You have to forgive my father, Julio.
He doesn't know a word of Spanish.
Who don't know a word of Spanish?
I know all that stuff.
And I know some cuss words too.
You wanna hear some?
The man came to talk to you, Pop.
At least listen to what he's got to say.
Sit down, Julio.
Thanks, Lamont.
Mr. Sanford, I've been thinking about what happened, you know and maybe I make a mistake.
Here I am a newcomer in the neighborhood.
I move in next door to you, and instead of coming over and introduce myself I make all kinds of noise and bother you.
I apologize.
And together with my apology, I bring you a gift.
Yes, sir.
You grow this in your own garden?
We don't smoke this stuff.
I didn't grow it, but I made it.
That's goat cheese.
Then why don't you give it to your goat?
You don't understand.
Goat cheese is good for you.
It's very healthy.
I only like American cheese and you can't get American cheese from a Puerto Rican goat.
- What's the matter with you?
He gave - Wait a minute.
- You will not take the cheese?
- I don't want cheese.
Take it and put it back in your goat.
You are an impossible person, Mr. Sanford.
Like a fool, I try to be your friend, but you refuse.
You will not see me around here again, you sangano.
- What?
- You heard me.
You are a big dummy.
Who you calling a dummy, you big dummy?
Where I come from them is fighting words.
- Julio, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too, Lamont.
I'm sorry that you are the son of a sangano.
You said it again, didn't you?
Back off now.
Say it again.
I dare you to say it.
Let me hear it.
Let me hear it.
I just wanna hear it one time.
You say it again and I'll - You did it again, didn't you?
- Did what?
You heard what he called me.
I heard him, and I also heard you.
And he's right.
You are impossible.
- There he is again.
- Wait a minute.
- I'll answer the door.
- Just let him in.
Let him in.
Say it again.
Good morning.
My name is Watkins.
I'm looking for Mr. Fred Sanford.
I'm the county building inspector.
Lamont, this is the building inspector.
Come in, Mr. Watkins.
- Have a seat right over here.
- Thank you.
Well, exactly what is your complaint, Mr. Sanford?
I mean, against your neighbor, Mr. Julio "Fulantes.
" It's Julio Fuentes.
Well, what's your complaint against him?
My complaint is that I don't want him living next door to me.
Well, that's not really a complaint.
That sounds personal.
Well, let's say then, I personally don't want him living next door to me.
Mr. Sanford, my department does not deal in personal matters, only complaints.
- Then change it back to complaints.
- On what grounds?
On the grounds that his place is unfit to live in.
How can you say that?
You haven't been over there sinceJulio moved in.
I don't have to.
All I have to know is my next-door neighbor lives with a goat.
Talk about the odd couple.
You'll see for yourself when you get over there.
Well, I'll just have to get over there and check him out.
Yeah.
Check him out and then chuck him out.
Can he actually get thrown out?
Well, yes, it's possible.
We might have to condemn his building and force him out if he's violation of the building codes.
- Like what for instance?
- There's all sorts of violations.
- Faulty and exposed wiring - That's him.
- Structural weakness - He got that too.
- Unauthorized dumping area.
- I can see that from here.
- And what about Latin lettuce?
- I beg your pardon?
- Nothing.
He's just imagining things.
- Well, I better get on with my job.
Mr. Sanford, if it weren't for concerned people like you we wouldn't catch all the violations in this area.
We're so understaffed.
And I wanna thank you for being so conscientious.
Well, you see, I didn't want the beauty of my community destroyed.
Yeah, yeah.
You see, this is a nice residential area and I don't want no cheese factory next door.
Well, I don't blame you.
Well, thank you, sir.
- Thank you very much.
- Good-bye.
Did you hear what that building inspector said I was?
Conscientious.
- And that's not all you are.
- What are you talking about?
I don't wanna talk about it no more.
I'm going down to the diner to eat because I don't wanna be in this house any longer.
You're gonna stay mad because I reported that pest next door?
I told you I don't wanna discuss it.
I'll see you later.
I'll tell you why I did it.
I did it for you.
- For me?
- Yeah.
This neighborhood can only stand so many junkyards.
I ain't gonna be around much longer and I wanna make sure that after I'm gone that you would be the king of all this.
Thanks a lot.
See, son, you don't appreciate nothing.
A lot of sons never appreciate what their fathers do for 'em and tell 'em.
TakeJohn D. Rockefeller.
He built up a great, big business in oil.
Did his kid appreciate it?
No.
He blew it and became a governor.
- Well, I'll see you later, John D. - Okay.
Well, go on and see what happens to you when I'm not around to protect you.
They'll take you apart 'cause you not a fighter like me.
Look what I got, man.
The building inspector gave it to me.
- I wasn't expecting anything like this.
- Julio, I'm sorry.
Don't be mad Mad?
Why should I be mad?
I'm proud.
Yeah.
He said you sent him over and he gave me a citation for doing such a good job fixing up my place.
Look at this.
A citation for neighborhood improvement from the Board of Supervisors, Building Department, County of Los Angeles.
"The owner of this property has contributed to the betterment of his community by renovating, restoring and generally improving his home area and has thereby earned the appreciation of his city and county.
" And he said because you was nice enough to send him to me will I be nice enough to give this to you.
Yeah.
One for you and one for me.
That's chevere, man.
I like that.
Good neighbors do come in all colors.
Lamont, read mine for me.
I can't see without my glasses.
Okay.
"Board of Supervisors, Building and Safety Los Angeles, California.
Dear Mr. Sanford, you will be fined $200 if the following violations are not corrected within ten days: Faulty and exposed wiring, structural damage unnecessary litter, numerous fire hazards unauthorized dumping area, sidewalk obstruction dangerous and inflammable materials.
" Give me that.
Ain't nothing wrong with this place.
This place got a strong foundation.
No faulty wiring.
You couldn't find a better place nowhere in the world.
What are they talking about?
Okay, I'm coming.
Lamont's fixing lunch.
I'll call him.
Lamont, it's for you.
No, señor.
This is for you too.
Yeah.
Julio, what's up?
Well, I brought something over for you and your father.
I really want us to be good friends and good neighbors.
- What is it?
Let me take a look.
- Some good food.
I fix it myself.
- All right.
- I ain't eating no "mofungus.
" You mean mofongo.
No, you didn't give me a chance to explain.
- This is not mofongo.
- No?
What is it?
This is spareribs candied sweet potatoes and mustard greens.
Look at that.
Candied sweet potatoes, spareribs and mustard greens.
- That's right.
- Lamont, just smell it.
- All right.
- Hey, thanks a lot.
It's nothing, really.
Thank you for fixing my favorite kind of dish.
- Good.
Amigos?
- Amigos.
Where did you ever learn to cook a dish like that?
I learned all that while I was living in New York.
Yeah, I lived in Harlem.
Julio, if all the Puerto Ricans was like you, Harlem would be a paradise.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
The brother will give him some advice.
This is gonna be a doubleheader.
We've got the Big Deal worth 10,000-plus behind door number one or door number two or door number three.
- What door do you want?
- Take door number three.
- The car's in door number three.
- What are you talking about?
Door number two is the winner.
Door number three is a zonk!
Take two!
Take two!
Two!
See?
She picked number two.
Yeah.
Now watch what she gets.
See there?
She ended up with a cow with a straw hat on.
I can't figure it out.
I can figure it out, Herman.
The lady's just stupid.
Wait a minute, Fred.
Why do you say that?
How many smart people do you know be dressed like a pizza?
And another thing that makes her stupid is she listened to you.
You're not so smart either.
What about yesterday on Jeopardy when you told that woman that Sherlock Holmes is a famous housing development?
That was just an honest mistake.
But there was no excuse for you picking the wrong door.
And besides, if you're so smart, how come you're just a junkman like me?
If God wanted me to be a junkman, I am smart enough not to ask why.
You know the trouble with you, Sanford?
You have a narrow mind.
And you know the trouble with you, Goldstein?
You got a big mouth.
I don't have to stand here and listen to those insults.
If I want to be insulted, I'll call my mother-in-law.
- I'm going.
- Who needs you?
Who needs you?
And bock bagel!
This is off-limits to you.
And don't never come back here no more.
I wish he would come back here again.
I'll knock him out.
What are you doing?
The whole neighborhood's gonna hear you.
- I don't care who hears me.
- Would you get in the house?
I'll knock him cold.
What's wrong anyway?
I thought you and Goldstein were friends.
I don't wanna talk about it.
What are you doing here so early?
I couldn't wait to get home to show you this.
- You know what this is?
- Let me see that.
Yeah.
It's an old rusty gun.
That's an original Revolutionary War rifle.
I picked it up at an auction for 50 bucks.
You paid 50 bucks for this?
This is an original Revolutionary War rifle.
It's called a Brown Bess.
And they sold it to a brown dummy.
I thought you'd say something like that.
Look, when I left the auction, I went to two or three gun shops.
Each told me that if I was to clean it up and polish it real good I could get as much as $800 for it.
It's an antique.
You see how rusty it is?
Look at it.
That don't mean nothing.
Know how they make these things look old?
They take 'em and beat 'em with a chain.
Then they bury 'em in the ground so the worms can gnaw at 'em.
Then they dig 'em up and leave 'em in the rain for three or four days.
Then they take it to an auction.
And the man says "Sold to the dummy with the black mustache.
" You don't believe me?
All right, hold this.
Hold that.
See these three business cards?
They're all from gun stores.
Each one of these guys told me I could get $750 for that rifle.
- Let me get a good look at this rifle.
- Why don't you quit pretending?
You don't know nothing about antiques, and you know even less about guns.
- Who don't know about guns?
- You don't.
Are you kiddin'?
World War I. Fred B. Sanford.
B. Sanford?
What's the B for?
Bull's-eye.
Machine gunner, World War I. Rifleman, pistol expert.
How about that?
That's not the way I heard it.
It was World War II.
And it was Fred B. Sanford, all right, and the B wasn't for bull's-eye.
It was Fort Dix, New Jersey.
Potato peeler, latrine orderly and KP.
How 'bout that?
How 'bout one across your lip?
Pop.
You might know something about modern guns - but not about a 200-year-old gun.
- Who don't?
You don't.
Next you'll be telling me you was in the Revolutionary War.
I wasn't, but one of my ancestors was.
Buford Sanford.
- Buford?
- That's right.
Buford Sanford.
He was a slave.
When the Revolutionary War started they let him off so he could go ahead and fight.
He was so good that when the war was over they was nice enough to let him go back to being a slave again.
Then how come I've never heard about him?
I was saving it for the right moment.
- They tell other stories about Buford.
- Like what?
You remember that picture where's three guys marching and one of'em is blowing the flute and the other one is carrying the flag?
"The Spirit of'76"?
That's it.
Guess who was playing the drums.
- Buford?
- Buford.
I've seen that picture a thousand times, and all three of them dudes is white.
So what?
How many times you seen pictures ofJesus and he's white?
What about 'em?
That's wrong too.
Because you can't hang around Jerusalem 30-some-years don't wear no hat and stay white.
Nobody in our family had anything to do with the Revolutionary War.
Are you kidding?
My grandfather told me stories about the Revolutionary War.
How the soldiers fought then.
Give me that rifle, let me show you.
Buford was one of the best shots in all the whole service.
See, the British fought like this.
They lined up in a long line, all side-by-side.
It was march, march.
They'd fall down to one knee and fire.
Like that.
Step, step, fire.
- Terrific.
- Buford was the best shot in his outfit.
You know that command they used to give, "Don't fire till you see the whites"?
It was, "Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.
" Buford never waited that long.
See, he'd be hiding in the bushes, and soon as they got nice and close he would just pick 'em off Pow!
Then he's ease farther in the bushes.
He sees more of'em coming and he Pow!
Just like that.
Then he'd wait for some more of them to come.
Didn't make him no difference.
He'd see 'em coming Pop, are you all right?
Why didn't you tell me that damn gun was loaded?
I think I broke my shoulder or something.
The only thing you broke was that window over there.
You can replace the broken windowpane but you can't replace a broken shoulder.
I wonder where that bullet went.
Don't worry about that old bullet.
- They hit something and fall apart.
- It had to land someplace.
I'll take a look at these binoculars Wait a minute.
Where'd these binoculars come from?
Those binoculars?
I use those for business purposes.
What do you mean, business purposes?
- You know Sherman, the junk dealer?
- Yeah.
I use them to check out his inventory, see what the competition is doing.
No, you don't.
You've been using these to look at his wife.
You train these binoculars on their bedroom, and you check out his wife.
I swear, honest, Lamont.
Honest.
I haven't looked at his wife.
Not once.
Not once since she been putting on weight.
Uh-oh, what?
There's a broken window across the street.
That's Goldstein's window.
Let me see that.
You see?
See that broken glass?
- Wow, is she fat!
- Would you look at Goldstein's window?
Uh-oh is right.
The bullet from that rifle went right through Goldstein's window.
Some kid could've threw a brick through that window.
Or maybe it was a meteor.
That's what it was.
A meteor came down from Venus or someplace and crashed through Goldstein's window and landed in his kitchen.
No, I think you shot a hole through Goldstein's window.
Hey, wait a minute.
What if Goldstein was in there and you Don't say that.
Don't even think it.
In the first place, if the bullet did go through his window it didn't have enough power in it to kill a man.
And the second place, we don't even know if Goldstein was in the room.
And in the third place, it's about time for both of us to get out of town.
Wait a minute, Pop.
I'm worried.
Goldstein never leaves that house.
The only time he ever leaves that room is to come over here and look at TV.
Maybe the bullet didn't hit him.
If that bullet didn't hit him, he'd be in the street screaming bloody murder.
Murder?
Don't say that.
You had to have an argument with him!
What'd you have an argument for?
The neighbors probably heard you.
They'll say that you gunned him down.
Stop it.
If he did get shot, you know it was an accident.
You believe that.
Yeah, I believe it and you believe it, but will a jury believe it?
Ajury?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about a shooting and you did it!
Pop, you shot a man!
Oh, this is the big one.
You hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm comin' to join you, honey.
Guilty!
Guilty!
What am I gonna do?
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life in jail.
All my years of hard work.
They'll take me away, and I'll lose all this.
Don't worry.
If anything happens to you, I'll take care of this place.
How you gonna take care of the place from a jail cell?
Jail cell?
What are you talking about?
I didn't shoot that rifle.
You did.
- I didn't buy that rifle.
You did!
- I didn't pull the trigger.
- I didn't load it.
- Neither did I. All three of us are in this together.
Me and you and the soldier who loaded that rifle 200 years ago.
Wait.
We're not absolutely positive that Goldstein is dead.
How we gonna find out?
Keep watching the sky till we see buzzards circling?
No.
All we gotta do is just sit over here and keep watching Goldstein's light.
What good is it gonna do to sit over here and watch Goldstein's light?
If his light goes off at 8:30, like it always does that means he turned it off, and he's alive.
And if it don't go off, that means that he's dead.
- Lf he's dead, you know what that means?
- Yeah.
We're dead.
Hey, Pop, wake up!
Goldstein's light.
It's still on.
I looked through the binoculars, and it's still on.
You know what that means.
It means he didn't turn it off.
He didn't turn it off because he couldn't turn it off.
I hate to say it, but Goldstein is dead.
What else could it be?
If Goldstein is dead, then I'll soon be dead too.
And the sad part, no one will ever know the truth: The murder was your fault.
My fault?
How do you figure it was my fault?
Until you brought that rifle here the most dangerous thing I had was a baseball bat.
You ever hear of anybody getting shot with a baseball bat?
Are you gonna start that again?
Who told you to shoot the gun?
- I ain't gonna take no murder rap alone.
- Well, it's not really murder.
You didn't know what you were doing.
That's it.
Plead temporary insanity.
How 'bout if I plead I got a son with permanent insanity?
We're not absolutely positive that Goldstein is dead.
Maybe you're lucky.
Maybe he was just very seriously wounded.
Yeah, a flesh wound, like in one of them cowboy movies.
They never get more than a flesh wound.
- How we gonna find out?
- You could call him.
And if he's got a flesh wound, he'll stagger to the phone and answer it.
Good idea, Pop!
Why didn't I think of that from the start?
You ain't got what I got up here.
- We'll just call him up.
- What you gonna say when he answers?
Just one word mazel-tov!
- How many rings?
- It just started.
- Now how many?
- That's two.
- How many - Shh!
The telephone company say, always let the phone ring at least ten times.
Sometimes people will be sleeping.
Sometimes they be in the shower, and Sometimes they be dead.
He didn't answer.
He's dead.
Here's part two of the big one.
Goldstein and I be going to that old junkyard in the sky.
Me to Saint Peter and him to wherever he goes.
Wait a minute.
There's one other possibility.
Goldstein could be alive, but unconscious.
That would explain why he didn't answer the phone, 'cause he was unconscious.
There's only one way to find out.
One of us has got to go over there and see.
- Well, why don't you do that?
- Me?
Why don't you go?
- I ain't going over there.
- You're the one that shot him.
If I go over there and find him dead, the shock will kill me.
And if I find out he's alive, I'll be so happy I'll be jumping up and down and have a heart attack, and that'll kill me.
So either way, if I go, I go.
Okay, I'll go.
I'm gonna go out the back way so nobody'll see me.
While I'm gone, I don't want you to open that door for nobody.
Sometimes the cops try to disguise themselves as normal people.
Yeah.
I can spot a cop a mile away.
They got them crew cuts and have them big sideburns.
They wear a Arrow shirt with little, thin neckties.
And they wear them brown wingtip shoes with the design on the toe.
- And they chew gum real fast.
- That's right, so watch yourself, Pop.
Why did this happen to me?
Why am I being punished?
Maybe I should've went to church more often.
It's the cops.
It's the cops.
I know it.
He's got on an Arrow shirt and a thin necktie.
Oh!
What do you want?
I'd like to talk to Lamont Sanford about a firearm he has.
No, he's gone.
He went to a U.J.A. Meeting.
United Junkmen of America.
My name's Ronald Hart of Hart's Gun Shop.
Is that a Arrow shirt?
I don't know, but yesterday a Lamont Sanford stopped in my place to get a Revolutionary War rifle appraised, and I found a buyer for him.
He sold the rifle.
If he ever gets another rifle like that one I have a standing offer from a client of $1,000 for it.
A thousand dollars?
For a rifle that don't shoot?
They don't shoot, you know.
Of course they do.
They could kill a man today the way they did 200 years ago.
Then of course, the excuse would be that the idiot didn't know it was loaded.
Well, thanks a lot.
The guy was here from the gun shop.
I sure wish you'd have sold that gun yesterday.
We'd be $1,000 richer and we wouldn't be wondering if we'd killed a man.
- You can stop wondering.
- What do you mean?
I just knocked on Goldstein's door.
There wasn't any answer.
Another big one!
Part three, and the end.
Please don't panic!
The thing we gotta do is keep calm!
Now, don't panic!
I am calm.
I'm not panicking.
- We gotta get rid of that rifle.
- Yeah, that's what we gotta do.
- Here.
Here we go.
- What's the blowtorch for?
We can take the wood off this rifle and then melt the rest of it down.
- Good idea.
- Let's go in the back.
Hurry up.
- Who do you suppose that is?
- I don't know.
I'll answer the door and stall 'em.
You start melting it down.
Hurry.
Hey, Fred.
Just got a minute.
Hope you got some coffee.
I want you to meet my new partner, Officer Hopkins.
- This is a friend, Fred Sanford.
- Mr. Sanford.
What's the matter, brother?
Aren't you feeling well?
I don't feel too good.
I've been having a series of heart attacks.
Yeah, that's been going around.
What's the matter?
You worried about something?
It's just my heart.
It'll stop soon.
Say, what's that smell?
- What smell?
- I don't know.
You cooking something?
No!
Nobody's cooking anything.
See, Lamont is He's barbecuing, and he don't like nobody watching him while he's cooking.
Yeah.
Hey, Lamont, Brother Smitty's out here with his new partner.
- They wanna know what you cooking?
- What?
- They wanna know, is it done yet?
- Done?
No, it's not.
- It ain't done yet.
- What's he cooking?
Soul food.
Say, Fred, I don't know any soul food that smells like that.
This soul food comes from a special recipe.
- Brother Smitty and his new partner.
- How are you?
They came by for coffee.
- We don't have no coffee, do we?
- No, we're out of coffee.
- I told Pop we had to get some coffee.
- Sure did.
- Tea too.
- I'm sorry, men.
No coffee.
That's all right.
We'll stop by later when you have some coffee.
Let's go.
- What happened to your window?
Kids?
- Kids.
You'd think if a youngster broke your window, he'd be honest and confess.
You'd think so.
That soul food smells like hammer hocks and black-eyed rice.
- That's ham hocks and black-eyed peas.
- Oh, right.
Okay, let's We'll see you later.
You hear?
They don't fool me talking about hammer hocks and black-eyed rice.
- They know.
- I think so.
All that stuff about confessing See, they know.
They just wanted us to know they knew.
You know?
I know.
And because they're friends, they're giving me a chance to turn myself in.
I think you're right.
That's the only thing left for me to do, is turn myself in.
- Yeah, it's the only thing left to do.
- Well, I'll go turn myself in.
- You take care of all this nice stuff.
- Don't worry.
I will.
I spent a lot of years fixing this place up.
I'll just go turn myself in.
I sure will miss the old place, my truck.
Say, wait a minute!
Do you see what I see?
It's Goldstein!
Hello, Fred.
Hello, Lamont.
- It's you!
- Look at this.
I didn't think I would live to see the day to get such a welcome.
Come on in.
Did you hear him?
Yeah.
He said he never think he'd live to see the day Sit down.
Fred, I came over to apologize for yesterday.
I don't now why we had to fight.
Me either.
Last night I called you to apologize, and I couldn't get an answer.
And your light was on all night.
We were worried about you.
I was upset, so I went across town to visit with my son.
I left the lights on to keep the burglars away.
When I came home, you know what happened?
My window was broken.
Look at my hat that I left hanging on the back of the chair.
A bullet hole!
Know what I think?
I think some crazy guy shot off a gun in the street.
If I had been sitting in that chair, I wouldn't be sitting in this chair.
What am I talking about?
I wouldn't be sitting at all.
I would be laying in Mount Sinai.
That's where they go.
- Don't even think about it.
- No, don't think about it.
Who thinks about it?
I'm glad to be alive.
- And I'm happy we are still friends.
- Me too.
I'm going back to have a little lunch now.
- Why don't you have lunch with us?
- What are you having?
- Pig knuckles and red beans.
- I'll come back after lunch.
Goldstein lives!
There's only one word for it, son.
Mazel-tov!
Say, what are you looking at?
I'm watching Goldstein put his new window in.
You wanna take a look?
- Yeah, let me see that.
- I'm gonna go get myself some coffee.
Oh, lady, are you fat.
- Is Lamont Sanford home?
- Who are you?
I'm Mr. Hart from the gun shop.
I was here yesterday.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Come on in.
I'll call him.
Thank you.
- Lamont!
- Yeah, what is it?
The fellow was here yesterday Hello, Mr. Hart.
If you ever get another rifle like that Brown Bess, I can still get $1,000.
Listen, what kind of condition does it have to be in?
After all, we're talking about something that's 200 years old.
I wouldn't expect it to be in perfect condition.
- Wait just a minute.
- Where you going, Pop?
Pop!
What are you doing?
How much can I get for it like this?
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
I hate to see The evenin'sun go down I hate to see the evenin'sun go down Hey, Pop!
'Cause my baby She done left this town Say, Ray Charles?
Where's my breakfast?
'Comin' up.
I'm feeling tomorrow Just like I feel today Feel tomorrow Just like I feel today I'm gonna pack my trunk Make my getaway St. Louis woman With her diamond ring Diamond ring Diamond ring I hate to see That evenin'sun go down Take me back home Well, well, well What is goin' on in here?
Are you fixing my breakfast or is this a Lawrence Welk audition?
I'm cooking your eggs so they won't be runny.
Last time you say it look like a plateful of Dippity-do.
You've been in here all morning.
Does it take this long to fix eggs?
Listen.
Nobody rushed the hen that's supplying 'em so don't rush the cook that's frying 'em.
I haven't got all day, you know.
You sure in a bad mood this morning.
Maybe a hot meal'll make you feel better.
Good, hot breakfast.
How 'bout that?
See, that's my own special recipe here.
I call it, "De Omelet Fred.
" That looks terrible, Pop.
How do you expect me to do a hard day's work on a rotten breakfast like that?
For the rotten stuff you been bringing in, a rotten breakfast is good enough.
I'm tired of you complaining about the stuff I bring in because I know what that is.
That's just an excuse to cover up the miserable way you're running this place.
What's wrong with the way I run this place?
Just look at it, Pop.
Look at this place.
And look at you.
I'm gettin' sick and tired of the whole thing.
I'm getting tired of it.
I'm getting tired of your nagging and complaining and holding me back, and I've had it.
In other words In other words you don't like it here.
No, I don't like it here.
And as a matter of fact if it wasn't for you holding me back I could've been out of this junkyard a long time ago and into an office.
Yeah, the welfare office.
If it wasn't for you taking me out of high school there's no telling where I would've been now.
The only time you was ever number one is when you was the first dropout.
And look what I dropped into.
A gravy train filled with biscuits.
You ain't gonna find nothin' good as this nowhere else.
I'm gettin' sick and tired of waking up at 6:00 in the morning and eatin' rotten food and doing all the work around here.
Let me tell you something else.
I'm carrying you.
Where?
I ain't been nowhere.
I been here all the time and ain't leaving.
You ain't carrying me nowhere, dummy.
That's another thing I'm gettin' tired of you calling me a dummy.
The only reason I call you a dummy is because I call them as I see them.
Dummy.
So you don't think I can make it on my own?
I know you can't make it on your own.
Then I'm just gonna have to prove it to you!
What does that mean, you gonna prove it to me?
- I quit.
- You mean you quit the partnership?
Bingo!
Give the man a cigar.
If you give up your share of the business then if I die, you won't be gettin' all of this.
You know who'll be gettin' it?
State of California.
I don't think the State of California would accept it.
They got enough pollution.
So you're really going, huh?
That mean we won't be seein' each other no more?
I'll come around and visit you on Fridays like Goldstein's son.
You know, that old junk dealer down the street?
His son visits him every Friday night and they have chicken soup.
That's because theyJewish.
See, and every Friday night they do something religious.
So is that what we gonna do, something religious?
Where will you be workin'?
That's exactly what I'm gonna find out.
I'm going to the unemployment office and see what kind of jobs they got.
I wanna get me a job where I can use my head as well as my hands.
They got it for you.
They'll put a cap on your head and a broom in your hand.
That's very funny, Pop.
And just to show you that there's no hard feelings I'm gonna stick around here until you get somebody to fill my job.
I'll have your job filled tomorrow.
- You think so?
Who you gonna get?
- Anybody.
I'm gonna change the sign from "Sanford and Son" to "Sanford and Anybody.
" I don't care what you do, I'm gettin' out of here.
I'm gonna get me a job.
I don't care.
Listen, you ain't never gonna find another job like this one.
You'll be back here tomorrow begging for your job.
Ain't nobody gonna hire you.
One thing to be a dummy, and it's another thing to be stupid.
And ain't nobody gonna hire no dummy, stupid.
Stupid dummy.
- Mr. Clifford?
Lamont Sanford.
- That's right.
Yes, thank you.
I'll take that.
Please be seated.
First of all, let me ask you a few questions, Mr. Sanford.
What's your educational background?
I was working toward my PhD, but I didn't quite complete it.
I see.
How far did you get?
About the tenth grade.
Okay.
What was your last job?
Well, I was, uh I was in commodities, Mr. Clifford.
Commodities.
Could you clarify that a little?
You see, I was the head collector.
I collected things that ordinary people don't recognize as being valuable.
- You mean, discarded objects?
- In a manner of speaking.
Are you trying to tell me that you're a junk man?
Actually, that's what I was trying not to tell you.
Let's see if you're qualified for unemployment compensation.
Unemployment compensation?
I came in here to look for a job.
There's no reason why an able-bodied man can't find a decent job in this land of opportunity.
I'm here to tell you that I'm prepared to roll up my sleeves and go to work.
I don't have to depend on a mere handout of $65 a week.
- It's $75.
- It is?
As much as I hate to, Mr. Clifford, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to I'm afraid I'm gonna have to accept that unemployment check of $75 a week.
Well, you won't have to.
Here's one that's right up your alley.
You know where up my alley.
- That's Ralph Backstrom's junkyard.
- Yes.
Mr. Backstrom's looking for someone.
Do I have to take this job?
There's no chance of me getting unemployment?
Not as long as we can find you a job right up your alley.
Okay?
You can start to work in the morning.
First thing in the morning, I want you to go to the Supreme Salvage Company and pick me up some bathtubs I ordered.
By the way, can you drive a truck?
Yeah, I know all about trucks.
I can take one apart in five minutes, man.
I ain't talkin' about stripping 'em, I'm talking about driving 'em.
- You got a driver's license?
- Oh, yeah, right here.
You sure take an ugly picture.
Oh, that's because it was early in the morning.
When you this ugly in the morning, you that ugly at night.
Look here.
Now, I got I got this address and I got the check.
Here's the address to go pick up them tubs, and take this check.
- Okay?
- All right, Mr. Sanford.
Now, if you try to run off with my truck and try to cash that check, I'll find you.
Might take me a week, might take me a month, might take me years.
But one day, maybe 50 years from now you'll be walkin' down the street, and when you least expect it a 115-year-old man gonna jump out of the alley Jump out of the alley with a two-by-four and cave your skull in.
Come on, get to work.
- Right on!
- What?
Right out.
Right on.
Pop, who was that big guy I just saw leaving here?
Oh, that was King I mean, that was Norman.
Yeah, he's the new fella I hired.
- You hired somebody already?
- Sure.
I told you I would.
- How'd you do?
- Are you kiddin'?
I got a job just like that.
Uh, no kiddin'?
What kind of job is it?
Got a job in commodities.
Oh, you still in junk.
Listen, Pop, this is a different job.
I got more responsibility on this job.
Mr. Backstrom wants me to take over the whole operation.
Backstrom?
You going to work for old Big-Nose Backstrom?
- What's wrong with that?
- Nothing.
Everything'll be all right.
Yeah.
You got yourself a new man that you're happy with and I got myself a new job that I'm happy with.
Yeah.
I guess you'll you'll be leavin' soon, won't you?
Yeah, it looks that way.
Yeah.
Well, you gonna stay tonight for supper?
No, it's Friday night.
I got a heavy date.
Friday?
I almost forgot it was Friday.
What are you doin'?
Well, if you can go out, I can go out too.
Where you goin'?
I'm gonna have me some hot chicken soup down with Goldstein and his son.
Shalom.
Hello, Police Department?
I want to report a stolen Yeah, a big ugly fella drivin' it.
I don't know.
He just jumped in and took off!
Uh, yeah, Norman, it's time you took off.
You don't have to work all day, Norman.
Okay, Norman.
Good-bye, Norman.
- Say, who was that?
- That was Norman.
That's a funny thing.
It's almost 6:30, and he still wants to keep on workin'.
- He's all over the place.
- Oh, yeah?
- What happened to you?
- Oh, I had to work a little late.
Mr. Backstrom wanted some, uh, some advice about some, some financial matters.
Where were y'all discussin' it?
In the chimney?
This?
I got this helping a couple of my assistants move some merchandise.
- Assistants?
- Yeah.
Two guys that work under me.
No kiddin'?
Well, if you look like that and two guys work under you, they must still be buried.
The new man's working out okay?
Where's he at now?
He's out on the truck.
I guess I'll go upstairs, change my clothes and run down to the diner.
- Oh, no.
I got your supper ready.
- You have?
We don't work together, but you still my son.
I got your supper ready.
You sit at the table and I'll get your supper.
Okay, Pop.
- You're really tired, huh?
- Me, tired?
How you gonna get tired when you got assistants?
Yeah, that's right.
I'll get your supper.
Well, here you are.
- How's that?
- That sure smells good, Pop.
You know, when you want to, you really can cook.
What is it?
It's just steak, green beans and Rice-A-Roni.
It's my own recipe.
I call it "Steak-a-Rice-A-Roni-beany.
" These are my favorite dishes in the world, Pop.
- No kiddin'?
Isn't that a coincidence.
- Yeah.
I'll go get your dessert.
Dessert?
You got me dessert too?
Yeah.
You might not like it, but it's all they had at the supermarket.
- Deep-dish apple pie.
- Hey, Pop, you know that's my favorite.
That's another coincidence.
That's two coincidences in a row.
Ain't that a coincidence?
Finish eatin'.
I'll get this.
Hello?
Yeah, he's here.
Who's callin'?
It's ol' Big-Nose Backstrom.
Hello there, R.B. Excuse me, Pop.
I gotta talk about some business with Mr. Backstrom.
Okay, all right.
I'll get your dessert.
Would you mind closing the door?
Hello, Mr. Backstrom?
What do you mean, what am I doing home?
I worked an hour and a half overtime!
Did you expect me to unload all those refrigerators by myself?
I don't get that.
Of course I want the j Listen, if you don't But I What?
Well, you a white one!
- You still talkin'?
- That's right, R.B. Okay.
So long.
What did R.B. Want?
He just wanted to tell me that I did such a great job today that he's gonna give me some time off.
No kiddin'?
You only been workin' one day and now you're goin' on your vacation.
- That's not bad.
- I'll take two or three days off and just hang around the house, catch up on my readin'.
Yeah, that's nice.
You got a good job workin' for a nice fella and I got me a good man workin' for me a guy that you can like and trust right away.
Yeah, it's nice.
- Yeah, that's really nice.
- Yeah.
You know what?
You know what's really nice about it is we don't work together no more, but we still friends, right?
Right.
Say, Pop, I think I hear the truck.
You hear the truck?
Oh, yeah, you hear the truck.
That's Norman.
That's Norman bringing the truck back with the stuff.
You thought he was gonna steal the truck, didn't you?
- What are you talking about?
- Nothin'.
I'm gonna help him unload them bathtubs.
What took you so long?
You been gone all day!
- I stopped home for a bite to eat.
- Where you live, Cleveland?
Oh, you sure are a trip, Pops.
But you won't be mad at me when you see this great buy I got you.
This is really out of sight.
You ready?
This is the one.
Hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm comin' to join ya, honey with a bear behind.
Wait, Mr. Sanford.
It ain't real!
It's stuffed.
Stuffed?
What am I gonna do with a stuffed bear?
You mean, you don't know what it's for?
Look.
Every night before you go to bed, take this bear and put it in the window, see.
And then you shine a whole lots of light on it.
Then if any burglars break in and try to steal something when they see this bear it scares them, see!
- It's a watch bear.
- Why, you big dummy!
A watch bear?
You a bigger dummy than my dummy!
I oughta take you and shove you down that bear's throat.
I gave you a check to bring me some bathtubs, and you come with a bear.
If you don't take this bear back I knew you wasn't gonna make it.
Look at you, 200 pounds of brawn and a half ounce of brain.
You get my money for this bear, or I'll get me a crowbar and peel your head.
Come on, Pops, take it easy.
- And don't call me Pops.
- Hey, Pop!
I said, don't call me Pop.
Oh.
Hey, son.
Norman and I were just discussin' the rare purchase he just made.
- What's it for?
- What's it for?
Are you kiddin'?
Move, Norman.
Let me explain to this dummy.
See, this is a watch bear.
You put this in the window and shine lights up on it and it keeps burglars away.
You put that thing in the window and it'll keep the customers away!
Excuse us, Norman.
You stay out here and watch the bear.
Don't pull on my clothes.
You know I don't like that.
Sit down.
Listen, this guy's gonna drive you out of business.
He's been gone all day and comes home with a bear.
It's his first day on the job.
You gotta give him time to learn the business.
If we give him anymore time, there won't be no business.
I just can't stand around here and let this guy do this to you so I'm gonna quit my new job, no matter how good it is and come back to work here for you.
Well, won't R.B. Be mad?
I don't care, let him.
Blood's thicker than water.
- Yeah, what'd he ever do for you?
- That's right.
Say, Pop, there's just one thing.
What about Norman?
I wouldn't do it for nobody else but I'd do it for you, son.
I'm gonna fire him.
- But won't he be mad?
- I don't care.
Let him be mad.
- Right.
What did he ever do for you?
- He brought me a bear.
That's exactly why you should fire him, Pop!
Yeah, I'm gonna fire him.
Say, Pops, where's my bread, man?
You want your bread?
Here.
There's your bread.
Now, you fired.
And don't Don't never call me Pop.
- You come out here and say that, Pops.
- You come on in here!
Come on.
Listen, I'll left hook you to death.
- Said that out, didn't I?
- Yeah.
Looks like we're back in business again.
- Partners once more.
- You know it.
Right.
You know what, Pop?
We can at least say one thing.
- We gave it a chance.
- Right again.
And we both know that we can make it on our own.
- Right.
- Right.
Listen, son.
Why don't you get over there and finish your supper?
'Cause you know why?
One of the worst things in the world is cold Steak-a-Rice-A-Roni-beany.
- Right.
- Right.
- Nice to have you home where you belong.
- It's good to be home, Pop.
Imagine that Norman!
He really turned out to be bad news.
Imagine somebody buying something as stupid as a watch bear.
You know, I thought about that, and maybe he wasn't too stupid.
What do you mean?
Last night when you went to sleep I thought I heard a prowler so I got up, went outside and propped the bear up against the house.
- You think that kept the burglars away?
- Of course it did.
Ain't nobody come and steal nothin', did they?
I don't even want to talk about it.
Did you bring the mail in this morning?
I forgot.
I'll get it now.
Feelin'tomorrow just like I feel today Feelin'tomorrow What's the matter, Pop?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Say, Pop!
Hello?
Police.
I want to report a stolen watch bear.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Jelly, jelly, jelly Jelly stays on my mind - Hello, son.
- Who are you?
Billy Eckstine?
Say, what's that on you?
You smell like a lemon.
I know that.
I just got through taking one of them bubbly lemon baths and I sprayed on some of that new lemon spray cologne.
What's with this sudden desire to turn yourself into a lemon?
Well, that way the ladies can sniff me and squeeze me simultaneously.
You gonna tell me the rest?
Like why you smell the way you do and why this place is all flowered up, or should I guess?
No, I'll tell you.
Sit down, son.
It's a long story.
Well, could you make it a short one?
I got a date, and I want to take a bath.
Well, you gotta wait anyway 'cause I used all the hot water.
Sit down.
That's just great.
Now what am I supposed to do?
Just pretend that you're in Sweden.
You know, in Sweden they take cold baths and beat each other with switches.
Never mind.
Who's coming here tonight?
Well, I got a call from an old girlfriend.
I mean, not just a girlfriend.
She could've been your mother if she hadn't been so headstrong and had such a bad temper.
Well, how come you're going through all these changes about her coming here if she was so headstrong and had such a bad temper?
Well, you know what they say "Fine wine mellows with age.
" And if she was fine then, by now she must be like imported muscatel.
Right.
Well, I'm gonna take a bath, Pop.
Wait a minute.
Let me finish telling you about her.
See, her name is Juanita, and she got Spanish blood in her.
And she always used to have a rose between her teeth.
I guess it was kind of hard for her to eat that way, wasn't it?
No, she was a dancer.
I mean, she could really hoof.
You know what I mean?
She was the best dance partner I ever had.
We used to win all the prizes.
I remember one time I pulled Juanita through my legs like this pulled her up and threw her over Count Basie's band.
We won first prize that night two tickets to Green Pastures.
I took your mother to see that.
You took Mom?
How come you didn't takeJuanita?
She was in traction.
So your old girlfriend and dance partner is coming to see you, huh?
Well, you don't need me around.
Anyway, I got a date, Pop.
Yeah, I don't need you.
Two is company, and three is definitely a crowd.
Maybe we can figure out some of them old dance steps we used to do.
Say, Pop, whatever you do, don't try to throw her over your back.
'Cause at your age, the first prize for that is a truss.
I'm going upstairs to take a bath.
That's Juanita now.
Come over here and say hello toJuanita.
Oh, man.
Fred Sanford!
Steady Freddy!
Juanita, my old dancing partner.
Shall we?
Why not?
Oh, Fred, you always did look like Valentino when you danced.
Yeah, me and the Sheik.
Lamont, this is Juanita Grismoore.
How do you do?
This is my daughter Alice.
- Alice, this is my son Lamont.
- How do you do?
My goodness.
You look like a portrait of your mother.
But you do have your father's eyes.
Those devilish eyes.
My mother's talked so much about you over the years, Mr. Sanford.
- I feel as if I know you.
- Just call me Fred, honey.
- Okay, Fred.
- And, Lamont, you can call meJuanita.
Huh?
Oh, yeah, right.
Everything seems to be nice and friendly.
What do you say we sit down?
- Oh, good.
- Come, darling.
You know, Fred, Mother still has the trophy that the two of you won.
She treats it like it was an Academy Award.
- Hey, I dance myself, you know.
- Oh, really?
I can do the Robot, the Good Foot, the Booty Bump, the Crutch and the Hip.
That don't sound like no dance.
That sounds like a serious accident.
You're just old-fashioned.
Why don't you go get that stuff I got chilling in the refrigerator and let us all have a bit of the bubbly?
Ooh!
Champagne!
No, soda and ripple.
Go get it, son.
No, wait.
Mother, I think we'd better get that light fixed.
'Cause we're gonna get stopped tonight if we don't get that light fixed.
Oh, yes.
One of our headlights is out.
Well, you better get it fixed, 'cause it's death on a nigger with one light.
If you got one light, you better be on a motorcycle.
I'm not kidding.
You go down there to traffic court and you sit around there and see so many brothers and sisters you'd think you're at an NAACP rally.
Well, we'd better get it fixed then.
Is there a garage nearby?
Well, if Lamont didn't have a date, he could get it fixed in a minute.
No, that was nothing, Pop.
It was just with the guys.
I can take your car down to Pete's Garage and have it back in 15 minutes.
I'd be glad to do it.
Oh, thank you.
That's very sweet of you.
- Would you like to come along?
- Why don't you, honey?
That'll give Fred and I a chance to get reacquainted.
And while they're reminiscing, maybe we could spend the evening together you know, take in a movie, do a little dancing, have a couple of burritos.
Oh, wow!
That really sounds great.
Yeah?
I don't have to change, do I?
'Cause I look a little shabby.
- Oh, no.
I think you look sexy.
- I do?
Yes, you do.
It's that wild, rumpled look that spells S-E-X.
In my day, that wild, rumpled look would spell B-U-M.
Well let's andiamo.
That's Italian for "let's split.
" Oh, you speak Italian?
Well, in my line of work you gotta be familiar with quite a few languages.
Yeah.
So you can know what people are calling you.
Come on.
Well, Juanita what do you say that I fix us a little liquid refreshment?
- Oh, I'll help you.
- Yeah.
- You have some nice things here, Fred.
- Yeah, I coordinate all this myself.
- Nice.
- Sit right down there, honey.
- Thanks.
- I'll get some nice stuff here.
You know, Juanita, you sure look good.
Even after all these years, you look good.
You've been taking care of yourself, haven't you?
I try.
And you look wonderful too, Fred.
Well, I try too, myself.
Hey, we'll drink to the good old days.
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, yes.
- Put a little soda in there?
- Yeah, a little soda.
- All right.
- Make it fizzy.
Hey, do you remember the good old days?
Hold tight, hold tight Fish is my favorite dish Yes, Fred, you've still got it.
Yeah, and I'm gonna keep it till somebody come and take it away.
I mean a handsome man like you is very eligible.
Why hasn't some girl caught you yet?
Isn't there somebody?
- Well, yes and no.
- What does that mean?
Well, yes, I'm handsome and eligible and no, she ain't caught me yet.
I'm free as a bird.
And what about you?
How does your husband like Washington, D. C?
- What's his name?
Gerard?
- Gerald has passed on.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes, Gerald has passed.
I've come here to settle his estate.
Estate?
I thought Gerald was a janitor at a mental institution.
No!
Now, where did you hear a thing like that?
Gerald was a consulting psychiatrist, and a very good one too.
What happened one of his patients a pyromaniac who was progressing beautifully had a slight setback and set the hospital on fire.
And when Gerald tried to save him, well, let's just say he died a hero.
Then you're free as a bird too, ain't you?
Yes, I am.
Ain't nothin' like two free birds you know, gettin' together over a glass of ripple, is there?
No, there sure ain't.
Listen.
I'm glad to hear that Gerald left you well off you know, with the estate and all.
Yes, quite well off, I might add.
But nothing takes the place of a man to help you raise a daughter.
Yeah, you definitely got to have that around.
Have you been looking?
I didn't have to look, Fred.
He was there all the time.
What do you mean?
I always knew it was just a matter of time and everything would work itself out right in the end.
What are you talkin' about?
- I'm talkin' about Alice.
- Alice?
What about Alice?
Gerald went to his grave knowing Alice wasn't his daughter.
Oh.
Well, wasn't his daughter?
Well, whose daughter is she?
You don't know, Fred?
Alice is our daughter.
What?
Didn't you get a good look at her?
Didn't you notice the same color and the same devilish eyes?
The same pouty look around the mouth?
Fred, Alice is your daughter.
What are you talkin' about?
That's impossible.
Fred, don't you remember the night of the Harvest Moon Ball?
- Remember what?
- Don't you remember Tutti Frutti Yeah, yeah, I remember!
If Alice is our daughter Oh, I think I'm havin' a big one!
If Alice is our daughter, then Lamont is out with his sister!
What you want Baby, I got it Hey, Pop.
- I said good morning, Pop.
- Morning, son.
You're up awfully early.
Didn't you sleep well last night?
Not a wink.
I got a lot of stuff on my mind.
- I was tossing and turning all night.
- Oh, yeah?
Well, I slept like a baby.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna fix myself a huge breakfast, and then I'm gonna fix you one too.
What do you want, Pop?
It's my turn this morning.
Say, Lamont, I didn't hear you come in last night.
Yeah, well, I was out pretty late, Pop.
Alice and I was out walkin' until real late.
Yeah, son, that's it.
You and her just keep walkin' all the time.
I mean just walk all the time.
You know, Pop, there ain't no smog between 1:00 and 3:00 in the morning.
It's the best time to go walking.
We had two burritos and a Fat Burger under the Watts Towers.
Son, sit down.
There's something I want to tell you.
There's something I want to tell you too, Pop.
Listen.
You remember that movie The Godfather?
- Yeah.
- Well, you remember that scene where this dude took one look at this chick and fell in love with her?
They called it getting hit by the thunderbolt.
- Yeah.
- That's what happened with Alice.
- Listen.
That's impossible.
- Why?
Because in that movie The Godfather, all them people were Italians.
Only Italians have thunderbolts.
That's just another way of saying "love at first sight.
" That's all.
And that's what it was with Alice love at first sight.
- Listen, son, you got to give her up.
- Give her up?
Why?
- Well, it just won't work out.
- But why?
Because if I was to marryJuanita and you was to marry Alice Juanita would be my wife, your stepmother and mother-in-law and Alice would be my daughter and stepdaughter.
That's just too damn much family in this little house.
You're wasting your time, Pop, but I think you'll get used to the idea.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna fix myself some breakfast.
I'll get that.
- Who is it?
- It's Alice.
The thunderbolt.
Hi, beautiful.
Yeah, I had a good time.
Hey, what's up?
Oh, that sounds terrific.
I'd love to.
Okay.
I'll see you then.
Bye, beautiful.
That was Alice.
She and her mother are gonna come over, cook dinner and serve it to us tonight.
- They are?
- I just might pop the question tonight.
- I mean, why wait?
- You can't do that!
Why not?
I love her!
You can't propose to a girl and say, "I love you.
Would you be my sister"?
Listen, Pop, in the first place, you and Juanita aren't married yet.
And even if you do, that's not gonna stop me.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna fix myself some breakfast.
A hundred million women in this country and the dummy had to fall in love with his sister.
You're early, aren't you?
I'm not finished dressing.
Neither is Pop.
Well, you just take your time.
Alice and I will go get started.
You sure you don't want me to help you?
You know, show you where everything is?
No, we'll find it.
You go finish dressing.
I had a nice time last night.
Did you?
At first I couldn't get to sleep, 'cause I had this warm feeling around my heart.
Do you think it was the burritos?
I know what it was, and I want to talk to you about it a little later.
- But right now I gotta go change.
- Okay.
- I'll go help Mother fix dinner.
- All right.
How about a little sugar for the first course?
Oh, my!
Well, baby, start getting used to saying "Papa Fred.
" - You're that sure of him?
- Honey, all I got to do is reel him in.
I wonder if that smoking jacket gonna fit Fred.
- Do you think he'll like it?
- Oh, I'm sure he will.
That was a good move on my part, you know?
- Why do you say that?
- When a woman's trying to hook a man she's got to use just the right bait.
Now, between that jacket and this food, well All you have to do is reel him in.
Alice, there's something that I want to ask you.
- See, I feel - Jelly, jelly, jelly There's your father.
- Jelly stays on my mind - What are you wearing?
What's it look like?
It's a smoking jacket.
You got something to smoke?
Fred, look at you!
You take me back 20 years.
That jacket was made for you!
I look good enough to be in the centerfold in Ebony, don't I?
You really do.
You really do.
Well, everybody sit down.
Dinner is ready.
Yeah, well, let's eat.
Alice, you sit over here by me, honey.
Lamont, you sit over there.
And you sit between - Why don't you sit over here?
- No.
I always sit here.
I always sit facing the door in my favorite chair.
I don't sit with my back to the door.
I'm just likeJesseJames.
All right.
You sit wherever you want to sit.
After all, you're the man of the house.
I'll go get the food.
Wait a minute, honey.
Everything smells so good.
- What is it?
- Well, first we're gonna have soup.
From the greens I took the tenderest leaves and with chunks of pork and onions, simmered it very slowly.
Then I poured the liquid into two warm bowls and let it sit for two minutes before serving.
I call it "soup a la collards.
" Oh, pot liquor.
I'll tell you what to do.
You give me some of them tender leaves from the collards and a couple of chunks of that pork and let me taste them fellas.
Anything you say, Fred.
Alice, aren't you gonna help your mother?
Why don't you come and give me a hand in the kitchen?
It'll be more fun.
Please?
All right.
Look here, Juanita, we ain't had too much chance to talk.
- Do you know what's happening?
- What?
Lamont kissed Alice last night.
Did you hear me?
Lamont kissed his sister.
I know, Fred.
Alice told me all about it.
It was just a brother/sister type kiss.
No, no, no.
Lamont is serious.
He said, "This is it.
" You don't "this is it" with your sister.
Don't worry about it, Fred.
I'll handle it.
Now, will you help me carry dinner in before the peas get cold?
You cute devil.
Well, here it is, all nice and hot.
I want you to try this salad dressing I made special.
That's enough.
Tell me if you like that.
You too.
A little bit there.
Mmm, this food is good!
You really outdid yourself this time, Mama.
Thank you.
Do you like it, Fred?
- Do you like it?
- Oh, yeah.
This is delicious.
- Good.
- Alice, can you cook like this?
Oh, no.
I never learned to cook like Mother.
In other words, if a man's gonna be around you he'd have to learn how to eat them TV dinners, huh?
Cooking isn't everything, Fred.
If a man really loved Alice he wouldn't care if she could cook or not.
That's right.
Young people don't care nothin' about food.
Love is more important.
- I give a marriage like that one month.
- Why?
Because that's about enough time to spend gettin' fed up on eatin' TV dinners and eatin' pork and beans and love.
And I'll tell you another reason why it won't work - We'll talk about that some other time.
- No.
I want to talk about it now.
Fred, I said we'll talk about that some other time!
You don't tell me what I can talk about You don't tell me what I can talk about in my own house.
Don't you point your finger at my nose, Fred Sanford!
I'll point my finger at your nose and I'll point my foot somewhere else in a minute.
You see?
The same!
Nothing has changed.
The same crude manners.
The same fightin' fists.
And you still got the same bad temper and the same big, fat mouth.
- You junk man!
- You battle-ax!
Are you gonna sit there and watch your father insult my mother?
Are you gonna stand there and let your mother insult my father?
- What are you, a spineless creep?
- Who are you calling a creep?
- Yeah, who are you calling a creep?
- You're both a pair of creeps!
Listen.
How would both of you like one across the lips?
Yeah.
I got two hands for two pair of lips.
Alice, come on.
Let's get out of here right this minute.
- Out of this dump!
- That's right.
Get out of this dump.
And stay out of this dump.
And here, take this faggoty jacket with you!
Now I know where my daughter get her qualities from.
She get her good looks from me and her bad temper from you!
Are you kiddin'!
Did you really believe Alice was your daughter?
- Did you really believe that?
- That's what you told me, witch.
That's what I told you 'cause I had something else in my mind at the time.
Alice is Gerald's daughter and she looks more like him dead than she ever would look like you alive!
Now I know why that psychiatrist janitor got burned to death.
He got too close to your fiery tongue.
It's a good thing I'm a church member.
Don't feel bad, son.
You found out just in the nick of time.
I don't understand it.
One minute she was sweet, and the next minute Yeah, the thunderbolt turned into a volcano.
- You told me I should wait.
- Yeah, I told you.
She couldn't dance.
She couldn't cook.
What was so special about her?
I don't know.
And she had bad legs.
She had them thick ankles.
- Her ankles were thick like stumps.
- Yeah.
I bet even sometimes they swell up bigger, like tree stumps.
I bet dogs would've followed her anywhere.
Hey, you know what, Pop?
She had a bad habit of sucking her teeth.
She ate two Fat Burgers, and she was You know, that's terrible, them teeth suckers.
- They even do that stuff at night.
- I know.
And you'll be sleeping.
They'll keep you up all night.
And did you see her eyes?
She had them funny looking eyes.
Yeah, she had them banjo eyes.
She had them eyes like they got in the funny paper Moon Mullins.
He said, "I'd like you to meet my wife, Moon Mullins.
" "How do you do, Miss Moon.
Would you stop sucking your teeth"?
Hey, Pop, it looks like the thunderbolt turned out to be a drizzle.
Yeah, and Juanita turned out to be a fizzle.
- Yeah, drizzle and fizzle!
- Drizzle and fizzle!
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
It must bejelly 'causejam don't shake that way - It must bejelly - Hey, Pop.
Hey, good morning, son.
I'll have your breakfast ready in a jiff.
That's even shorter than a jiffy.
Sit down.
Well, look.
Never mind.
I already had some breakfast.
There's something that I wanna do and I need your help.
- What's that?
- You know that old tub that's been sitting out in the yard for the last two years taking up space?
You mean that tub that Mrs. Bud's dog, Chi Chi had her puppies in?
- That's the one.
- Don't tell me Chi Chi's pregnant.
I don't know.
But if she is, she's going to have to find another spot to deliver.
I want you to come out and help me load the tub on the truck so we can take it down to the dump and dump it.
You know I can't lift no tub with my arthritis and bad heart.
There's nothing wrong with you.
What are you giving me?
I ain't giving you nothing, but I know what you're trying to give me.
A hernia.
I'll do most of the lifting, okay?
Even if you do most of the lifting.
See, that's what happened to a friend.
You know Harry Mayfield?
That's what happened to him.
He lift something heavy and it broke down in his back and now he walks all bent over like this.
The only people he can look straight in the eye is midgets.
He's in misery.
I'm telling you, the only good thing about it is when he walk down the street like this, he finds a lot of coins.
- Are you coming?
- I could go out there and that tub could fall on me and crush me to death.
- I said, are you coming?
- The tub could fall on both of us crush us to death, then there wouldn't be no more Sanford and Son.
It'd be Nobody and Nobody.
- One, two, three - What you counting to?
Ten.
Four, five, six What's gonna happen when you reach ten?
The television is going in the pawn shop.
- Seven - Okay.
All right I'll help you.
Getting rid of this tub is just the beginning, Pop.
We're getting rid of this miscellaneous, extraneous debris once and for all.
How do you expect to attract customers to a place that looks like this?
Listen, Lamont, we running a junkyard.
It's not a barbecue pit.
Ajunkyard is supposed to be junky.
Grab the end of that tub while I take the tailgate down.
Why do I have to get all this stuff - Now what?
- There's a body in that tub.
- Hey, you're right.
- Somebody dumped a body in there.
- We in trouble.
Who is it?
- I don't know.
But he's white.
I know we're in trouble.
I know we're in trouble now.
Listen.
Wait a minute.
Don't panic.
You're not supposed to panic.
When I find a dead white man in my yard, I do what come natural, I panic.
I wonder who he is?
If you find out, write me at my sister's place.
'Cause it's good-bye, California, hello, St. Louis.
Wait a minute.
That body's not dead, it's breathing.
As a matter of fact, it's snoring.
You hear that?
Hey you, you better get out of there if you know what's good for you.
Get out of there.
Get on out of there before I give you a wood shampoo.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be trespassing.
That's what you're doing is trespassing.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- Yeah, hit the road, Jack.
- Just a moment, fellows.
Now I know you guys are just trying to do your jobs.
But if I could just talk to the owner of this property.
I'm the owner of this property, and we just had our little talk.
Now the next sound you hear will be the continuous pounding of this two-by-four off your skull.
- Now let's go.
- I'm going.
- I know when I'm not wanted.
- Good.
Oh, what kind of a world is it when a poor, homeless unfortunate can't grab 40 winks in a tub in a junkyard?
- It's just not worth living in.
- Try walking while you're talking.
This is the last straw!
I've been put out of flop houses and I've been kicked out of railroad yards in the dead of winter.
But I have never been kicked out of a junkyard before.
They're gonna find me in the morning in the river and they'll be sorry.
Listen, if you want to commit suicide go on down and stand up at 103rd Street in front of the pool hall.
Just act like you counting some money and they'll have to bring your hat to the cemetery.
That's right, make jokes.
But you'll be sorry when they find my body in the morning.
Not if I don't find it on my property I won't.
Wait a minute, Pop.
You think this dude is serious about killing himself?
I don't know, Lamont.
It's not my affair.
How would you like to pick up tomorrow's paper and read this guy killed himself because we kicked him out of our junkyard?
Well, I won't read the paper tomorrow.
What's it gonna cost us to extend ourselves a little, Pop?
Haven't you ever heard of the Good Samaritan?
You know I don't like them Japanese movies.
That's Samaritan, not samurai.
If you don't want him to stay, we might as well get this tub loaded.
Okay, okay.
This time it's okay.
I'll do it this time, just to show you that I'm a good samurai.
- Samaritan.
- Samaritan, samurai.
- What difference does it make?
- Hey, buddy?
You called me?
The name is Augustus.
But you can call me Gus.
Right.
Okay, Gus.
Now you can stay and sleep in the tub for a couple more hours, but after that you gotta get out of here.
- You got that?
- Thank you, young man.
God bless you.
All right.
Jelly, jelly Must be twins.
- What do you want?
- Excuse me, sir.
If you could just spare me a small glass of water, I would appreciate it.
Okay.
Come on in.
Stop right there.
Get mud on our rug.
You don't mind drinking out of a mayonnaise jar, do you?
I mean, you shouldn't mind drinking out of a peanut butter jar.
Thank you very much.
- Sure looks good.
- What?
This.
Here.
You can have it now.
Thank you very much, sir.
You act like you ain't never ate a sweet roll before.
Is that what this is?
A sweet roll?
I don't remember the last time I ate a sweet roll.
I don't mean to look like I'm putting you out, but you got to go.
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.
It's just my son wants you out of here before he gets home for lunch.
See, he's not as softhearted as I am.
I wonder, what are my chances of having lunch with you, Mr. Sanford?
Slim and none.
You done spent the night here.
You had your continental breakfast.
Now it's check-out time.
Thank you very much.
- Hello, son.
- Hey, Pop.
- Did you get rid of that hobo?
- Yeah, he's gone bye-bye.
Why don't you come in the house, I'll fix you a nice lunch.
Before that, let's get this tub loaded on the truck, all right?
Come on in the house and get your lunch.
You need the energy.
I've got the energy.
For the last time, let's get this tub loaded on the truck.
Come on in the house.
Come here.
I thought you said you got rid of Gus?
- All right, get outta there!
- Yeah, come on.
- Didn't I tell you to get rid of him?
- It was your idea to let him stay.
Only because he gave me that sob story about how he was going to kill himself.
He's a con artist.
Get out of that tub.
Now I'm going in the kitchen and fixing lunch.
When I come back, I don't want to see him.
He's as good as gone, son.
Come on, you.
Let's get on out of here.
Well, I'm going.
But just you remember I'll never contribute to the NAACP.
Good.
And I'll never contribute to the KKK.
What happened, Pop?
What'd you do to him?
I didn't do nothing.
I was helping him out the tub and he fell down.
No, he shoved me.
He shoved me hard.
My back!
- My legs!
I can't feel my legs!
- Let's get him in the house.
He crippled me.
You can't get away with this.
I have my rights.
This is America, and I'm gonna sue you.
You can't sue me.
I can sue you for trespassing.
Trespassing is nothing compared to crippling.
You don't know what you're talking about.
There are laws in this country to protect the common man.
Well, listen, you can lay there for a little while and don't get too comfortable 'cause you gotta go.
- Lamont, you don't think - We're in a lot of trouble.
If somebody gets hurt on your property, you're responsible and they can sue you.
- I didn't do nothing to him.
- I know that, but he claims Hello?
Legal Aid Society?
Say, listen, I wonder if you could answer a question for me.
Now, if somebody's trespassing on your property and in the process of evicting them they fall down and injure themselves is the property owner liable to the trespasser?
Okay, thank you.
It's like I said, Pop, we're responsible.
Might as well get used to Gus being around here for a while.
What?
Are you crazy?
Don't tell me nothing like that.
You mean to tell me that Gus is gonna live here with us and sleep on that couch?
Thanks to you.
Service!
Service!
Another beer, please.
Why don't you get up and go get it yourself?
Well, if a certain vicious, old junk dealer hadn't paralyzed me from the waist down, I'd be glad to.
If a certain funky old hobo don't watch his mouth I know a certain vicious, old junk dealer who's going to paralyze him from his waist up.
But if a certain vicious, old junk dealer doesn't get me my cold beer soon and show me some compassion, I'm gonna sue him to death.
Do you know what that is?
That's blackmail.
No, it ain't.
You know what it is?
It's "whitemail.
" I don't know how you're going to do it, but I want that freeloader out.
I had an idea how to get rid of him.
I called Bubba's friend, Dr. Caldwell.
- The one who treated me for whiplash?
- What can he tell you?
He can tell us if that guy's faking.
That's what he's doing, faking.
All we gotta do is prove it.
Sounds like our company's calling for another beer.
I wish I had somebody to bring me a nice, cold beer every time I wanted one.
Just get paralyzed from the waist down.
- I'll see you, son.
- Okay, Pop.
Well, there you are.
The service is pretty bad around here.
- Where's my beer, Freddie?
- Listen, don't call me Freddie.
If you don't like the service around here, you can get up and get out.
And another thing, if you want to commit suicide, it's all right with me.
All I ask you is not to do it on my nice furniture.
You know, I've decided life is worth living.
Nixon said he'd bring us together and darned if he didn't.
I hope that's the delivery from your liquor store.
Dr. Caldwell.
I gotta give it up, or they gonna kill me.
Them cigarettes will do it.
I'm talking about driving on the freeways.
Well, what's your trouble?
Here it is, Doc.
Stretched out over here on my couch.
I want you to examine him.
See if he's faking.
Wait a minute.
What is this?
This is the doctor that came to examine you.
Now examine him.
- How do I know he's a doctor?
- Well, ask him.
- Are you a doctor?
- What day is this?
Friday.
What's that got to do with it?
Because on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, I'm a doctor.
The other days, I work in the post office.
- Well, examine him, Doc.
- Is there someplace to wash up?
Yeah, upstairs.
I'll get you a towel.
Not me.
Him.
He's fiIthy.
What do you mean?
I can't move.
He pushed me down and paralyzed my legs.
- Paralyzed, you say?
- Yeah.
Well, then.
I guess we better take a look at you.
- You feel that?
- No.
- Oh, yes.
- What is it, Doc?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You just examined him.
That is correct.
But I'm not a neurologist.
What you should do is to take this man to see a specialist to determine the extent of the damages.
- But I can't be moved.
- That's true.
Well, isn't it true that an injury of this type could heal up overnight?
- That is true.
- Isn't it also true that an injury of this type can leave a person crippled for life?
And that is true.
What are you telling me?
Is he gonna be all right, or is he gonna be crippled?
I don't know.
Are you sure this ain't the day you're supposed to be at the post office?
Nevertheless, that is my suggestion to you.
May I add, do you have any idea how many doctors there are in this country honest enough to say they don't know?
- How many?
- I don't know.
That will be $10, please.
This ain't turning out the way I thought.
Good-bye and thank you very much.
And Doctor, cover up when you cough like that.
Put your hand over your mouth or something.
And stay off the freeways.
You mean you drank that beer I just gave you?
They do go fast, don't they?
Hello.
Oh, Lamont.
Yeah.
Hold on just a minute.
Yeah, Lamont?
Yeah, he's still here.
No.
The doctor wasn't no help.
Oh, I'll get rid of him if I have to burn the house down.
Say, that gives me an idea.
I'm not gonna burn the house down.
It just gives me an idea.
I'll see you, here?
Bye.
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Help!
Save yourself!
Everybody!
Save yourselves!
Fire!
Everybody here!
Fire!
Didn't you hear what I said?
I believe it was fire, fire, or something like that.
You're not just gonna sit there and burn up, are you?
I guess I've got to, I can't move.
And bring me another beer, please, Freddie, will you?
And make it a cold one this time.
You keep drinking beer like you're doing, something's gonna happen to you.
Some more cold beer coming up.
Wonder why I didn't think of that before?
Oh, when the lights are low And the dwindling shadows My, but you two have become mighty chummy.
I should've known better than to leave the two of you alone together.
Why'd you have to start drinking?
What's the matter with you?
- Wait a minute, Lamont.
Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.
You were supposed to get rid of him, and I come through the door and find you sitting in here singing and boozing with him.
Don't fuss in front of company.
Come in the kitchen.
- Since when did he become company?
- Come on in the kitchen.
- Shut the door.
- I don't understand I'm just buttering him up because I'm setting the trap.
He done got out of all the other traps.
This one, he's got to slide right into.
- What are you talking about?
- Let nature take its course.
He's been drinking beer all day and didn't get up once.
He keeps drinking beer like that, he's gonna have to get up sooner or later.
The simplicity of it.
That's perfect.
Why didn't I think of that?
'Cause you ain't simpleminded like me.
Come on.
Gus, everything's cleared up.
Just a little misunderstanding.
Yeah, I'm sorry I blew off the handle.
It won't happen again.
Yeah.
Listen, Gus, we gotta go down here to the shopping center and pick up a few things, be gone about an hour.
- Oh, great.
- Drink all you want, hear?
- Just take it easy, Gus.
- I'm bringing back plenty of beer.
Keep on drinking.
We got him now.
I could see it in his eyes when you offered him that beer.
Yeah.
Like the French would say, "Oui, oui, monsieur.
" Listen, I'll tell you what.
You take the truck and drive it up there and hide it around the corner then you come on back here to the house and I'll meet you in the kitchen.
- Roger.
- Roger.
- Did he move?
- He's upstairs in the toilet now.
I think we got him this time.
I know we got him this time.
That's what I call the flush of victory.
You call the police, and I'll go catch him when he comes down the steps.
Roger.
I caught you, didn't I?
You bum you.
You thought you was fooling around with a couple of chumps, didn't you?
Come on down here.
I'm gonna cave your skull in.
Now get out of my way, old man.
Get out of my way.
Hey, Lamont.
You got the police?
- Pop, what happened?
- He attacked me, son.
He attacked me.
Something snapped in my back.
Oh, my legs.
The feeling's going from my legs.
I can't feel nothing down here.
Lamont, my legs.
Call the doctor, son.
Call Dr. Caldwell.
And, son?
While you're at it bring me a nice, cold beer.
The road killed my pappy - Hey, Pop.
- Morning, son.
I'll have your breakfast ready in a "mo.
" That's the way used to say it around St. Louis.
"In a mo.
" You know, like M-O for Missouri?
Before we do anything else this morning let's get that tub loaded on the truck, okay?
- Are you back on that again?
- Yes, I'm back on that.
Now that freeloader's gone, and you don't have any more excuses.
- Now let's go.
- I got excuses.
I woke up this morning and my side was hurting.
Then my ankle "swole" up yesterday.
Then you know my arthritis and my heart.
I coughed all day Wednesday One, two All right, all right.
You start sliding the tub over, and I'll make room on the truck.
Gee whiz.
Why you keep putting this stuff all over Lamont.
Come here.
We can't load the tub.
Why?
Oh, no.
Chi Chi.
Chi Chi done had her second litter of puppies this year.
I think somebody ought to tell her about the pill.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
That's it, Donna.
Now you've cracked the left side.
Now crack the right side.
There you go.
Now you're crackin'.
Donna, you have talented fingers.
You could do a neck-crackin' concert at Carnegie Hall.
Why are you so tense this morning, Fred?
Didn't you sleep well?
No.
I watched the Late, Late Show, and I had a nightmare and got this crick.
Why?
What was on?
Dracula.
See, Bela Lugosi was circling all around my room and I kept jerking my neck out the way.
Ain't no mark there, is there?
You really had a nightmare, didn't you?
First thing that scared me, I thought he might try and nibble on my neck.
And the second thing that scared me, I thought I might like it.
But I'm sure glad you came by, honey.
Nothing's too good for my fiancé.
Of course, that was just for medicinal purposes.
Listen, can you refill that prescription on the lips?
Fred, it's only 8:00 in the morning.
Well, the clock of love has no hands.
You're real romantic, aren't you?
Yeah.
See, my lips are rated X. But we over 18.
- Oh, good morning, Lamont.
- Good morning, son.
Sorry for interrupting.
But I didn't think you'd have company this early in the morning.
I asked Donna to come by because I had this crick.
In your lips?
- You are feeling better now, Fred?
- Yeah, I'm feeling fine.
See?
That's terrific, Pop.
Now you can pose for police pictures.
I've got to be going.
I've got a patient waiting for me.
Well, thanks a lot, Donna.
I sure appreciate you coming by.
And listen, I sure wish you had more time so you could do my feet.
'Cause you do feet almost as good as you do necks.
How is she on giblets?
- I'll see you tonight, Fred.
- All right, Donna.
And listen, Donna, to show my appreciation tonight I'm gonna fix a special dinner for us with wine and candlelight.
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Bye.
Bye, Lamont.
Crazy 'bout her.
I sure am glad that's over with.
The way you two were carrying on, it was like she was going off to war.
No, it's just that when I'm around Donna, my heart say Well, that's because you got sludge in your crank case.
Say, where you going?
You ain't had your breakfast.
Because getting your neck cracked was more important than my breakfast.
So I'm going down to the diner.
And now that you got your neck straightened out why don't you try straightening this house?
I will.
I will.
See, I got new energy.
After that massage, I'm ready for the big game.
Play ball.
Yeah, I'm ready for the big game, and it's on now.
The Dating Game.
Yeah, Lamont?
Yeah, I'm coming.
I was cleaning up the house.
Good morning, sir.
May I speak with the lady of the house?
I'm the lady of the house.
I guess this beard fooled you.
Can I help you?
Could I interest you in some shortcuts to housecleaning?
You can interest me in how to cut housecleaning out altogether.
- Come right in.
- Thank you.
My name is Carol Davis, and I represent Nevins Household Products.
I have something that'll keep you from ever seeing dirt in your house again.
What you got there, blindfolds?
No.
Just wait till you see these great products, Mr Sanford.
Fred Sanford.
That's S-A-N-F-O-R-D, period.
- Come right in, then.
- Well, thank you.
Mr. Sanford, I want you to just look at the steel bristles on this brush.
It's just the thing for you.
Are you kidding?
That would scrape all the meat off my head.
No.
It isn't for your head.
It's for floors and carpets.
Here's something else that I think you might be interested in.
Say, if that's cockroach killer, you ain't gonna get 'em up there.
Our cockroaches ain't airborne, they infantry.
No.
It's a room freshener.
Disinfects and deodorizes.
Rids your home of noxious odors.
It's called "Paris in the Spring.
" Are you familiar with that aroma?
No, I'm more familiar with "Chicago Stockyards in the Summer.
" - Are you from Chicago?
- No, I'm from St. Louis.
But when the wind was wrong, you'd think you was in Chicago.
St. Louis.
I went to high school there.
Vashon High.
You went to Vashon?
I used to fool around in the hallways there.
Oh!
Did you go to Vashon High too?
No.
I just fooled around in the hallways there.
Well, it's a small world isn't it, Mr. Sanford?
- Call me Fred, and I'll call you - Carol.
- Carol.
Sit down, Carol.
- Well, thank you.
How long have you been in this kind of work?
Just for the past year.
I decided to do it when my husband passed away.
I was lonely, so I moved out here to live with my sister and I took this job.
Oh, then you're a doer.
See, I like a doer.
The trouble with most women is they're doers before they get married.
Then right after the wedding, they become "diders.
" - Not me.
I was always a doer.
- I can tell that.
- What's your sign, Carol?
- I'm Aries, the Ram.
No kidding?
I'm Sagittarius, the Hunter.
Oh, I better run from the hunter.
Yeah, and I'll chase you back into the woods.
- Carol, would you like a cup of coffee?
- That'd be nice.
- The kitchen's right over here.
- Okay.
But let me make the coffee.
You are an Aries, aren't you?
You like to do, do, do.
And I like it done, done, done.
You certainly have been successful, haven't you, Fred?
Yeah, I got me a nice little nest egg saved up.
And when my nest egg hatches, I'll say like the airline ads say "I'm Fred.
Fly me to Miami.
" I know very few men wise enough to plan ahead like that.
- What's that?
- That must be Lamont.
It must be lunchtime.
I didn't know it was so late.
Oh, good heavens.
We've been talking for hours.
I really have to be running.
It's amazing how time flies when the conversation's interesting, isn't it?
Yeah, like sand in the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.
Fred, that's very poetic.
Did you just make that up?
That's the word Macdonald Carey lives by every day at 12:30, 11:30 central.
Well, I want to thank you, Fred, for all your hospitality.
Well, it's quite all right, but Oh, Lamont.
This is Carol Davis, she sells household products.
- Hi.
- How do you do?
Excuse me.
I'm going to fix myself a sandwich.
Nice meeting you.
Well, Fred, I really have to be getting back to work.
I want to thank you again for your hospitality.
Well, listen.
Why don't you come back tonight and have dinner, and we can talk some more?
Are you sure?
That'd be awfully nice.
Well, I'm sure.
Uh, sevenish?
Perfect.
I usually stop work about sixish.
- Me too.
Give us time to freshen up.
- Right.
- I won't be too fresh.
- Oh, Fred, you are funny.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
She got a fine brown frame She looks good to me but all I I like her.
Hey son, I invited her back here to have some dinner with us tonight.
You know what sign her?
She's an Aries.
Aries the Ram.
And I'm Sagittarius.
That makes us compatible.
That's gonna be some compatible dinner tonight with a ram and a barracuda at the same table.
- What?
- Don't you remember, Pop?
You invited Donna for dinner tonight.
Gee whiz.
That was stupid.
I better go tell her.
- You better call her back.
- I ain't talking about calling her.
- I gotta call Donna.
- Call Donna?
What do you mean?
I gotta call Donna.
I don't understand you.
I thought you and Donna were engaged.
We are engaged, but tonight I have me another engagement.
Besides, this is the best time to call Donna because she's not home and I can leave a message with her answering service.
I don't believe you, man.
A woman you just met Hello?
I'd like to leave a message for Miss Donna Harris.
Yeah.
Sorry, can't make dinner tonight.
Please forgive me.
What?
Oh, Fred Sanford.
That's S-A-N-F-O-R-D, period.
Thank you.
Bye.
Let me warn you about something, Casanova.
Now at your age, you can't afford to burn the candle at both ends.
At my age, I look forward to burning the candle at both ends in the middle, round the side and up the back.
Just so long as the candle burns.
All right.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Listen, Lamont.
I'm not married.
I still got to sow some wild oats.
At your age, you ain't got no wild oats.
You got shredded wheat.
Okay, so I got shredded wheat.
But I still got a whole lot of snap, crackle and pop left.
She's gotta fine brown frame And I wonder what could be her name She look good to me but all I can see Is that fine brown frame Hello.
Oh, hello, Donna.
He can't come to the phone right now.
He's upstairs freshening up.
He's taking a bath.
No, there's nothing wrong.
I don't know why he can't make it.
Would you hold on a second?
Hello, Donna?
That message that was left on your service?
Well, it was wrong.
It wasn't that Pop couldn't make it for dinner tonight.
It was that he couldn't make dinner.
You know, fix it.
Right.
What he was wondering is that if you would cook dinner and bring it here?
Well, I'm sure that anything you cook would be just fine.
Why don't you surprise him?
Right.
See you then.
Bye.
She's got a fine brown frame St. Louis woman give her a diamond ring Pulls that man around by her apron string - What do you say, son?
- Pop.
I wish I could take a picture of that table.
It's beautiful.
Yeah, that looks great.
Say, Pop, I was wondering.
Is it all right if I stay and have dinner with you tonight?
What?
You know two is company.
I know.
But this is my home too, and a man's home is his castle.
I'm the king of the castle and I don't want no Prince Dummy hanging around here tonight.
Look, I'm not going to get in your way.
What difference will it make?
Look, Lamont, did I ever mess up your chance when you had a date?
This is an equal opportunity family, so bye.
Well, I'm not leaving.
Come on now, Lamont.
I went through a lot of expense to make this a romantic evening.
I even got some pink champagne chilling in the refrigerator.
- You bought champagne?
- Well, not really.
It's really ginger ale and Ripple.
See, I call it "champipple.
" Look, all I'll do is eat and then I'll leave.
Okay?
Listen.
That's Carol now.
You can have one glass of wine, and then you got to go.
One glass.
"Paris in the Spring.
" C'est si bon People say that in France Good evening, Fred.
What the hell is she doing here?
Donna?
Didn't you get my message?
Yes, I did.
Then I talked to Lamont and he cleared everything up.
Oh, Fred, I was only too happy to cook.
Now you get out of here so I can fix dinner.
Yeah.
You fix dinner.
I'll fix Lamont.
You tell Donna to come here and fix dinner tonight?
- Who, me?
- Don't give me the "who me" stuff.
- What'd you tell her?
- All I said was that Fred, there's a whole dinner in the oven.
It is?
Why, yes.
Why is that?
Why is that?
Well, see, it's because See, Lamont loves frozen dinners, so I was going to freeze them.
That's right.
But, of course, it doesn't compare to your cooking, Miss Harris.
- Why thank you, Lamont.
- You're welcome.
Why, would you like to stay for dinner?
Oh, may I?
Of course.
Why, I'll just set another place.
Thank you very much.
Listen, you know Carol's coming here.
What am I gonna do?
- It's all your fault.
- Who, me?
Don't give me that "who, me.
" Listen, I could get killed in here.
And then it'd be "Nobody and Son.
" Listen, that's Carol now.
Listen, you keep Donna in the kitchen.
Don't let her come out of the kitchen.
I'll take care of Carol.
Don't let her come out the kitchen.
Here I am.
Listen, Carol.
You don't mind going out to dinner, do you?
Well, no.
But I thought you were going to cook?
I did.
But, you're new here in town, and I thought I'd show you California.
All right, Fred.
But don't you need a jacket?
No.
See, I was going to take you to a Chinese restaurant and they don't care what you got on in one of them.
Hey, Pop, dinner's ready.
- Come on, Carol.
- Your son says dinner's ready.
It's ready for him, but not for us.
Let's go.
Wait, Fred.
We better not disappoint your son.
We better go in.
We can go out on the town another time.
- Wait a minute.
- Come on, Fred.
Oh, what a lovely table.
Good evening, Miss Davis.
Good evening, Lamont.
Donna Harris, this is Carol Davis.
She sells household products.
Working this late?
No.
I met Carol this morning.
She's from St. Louis.
And I wanted to show her some California hospitality so I invited her to dinner.
Why didn't you tell me this before, Fred?
Lamont should have told you when he talked to you on the phone.
That's right, Donna.
Miss Davis is having dinner with us.
Well, all right.
I'll set another place.
But I don't think there'll be enough for seconds.
Is she your maid?
No.
She's a friend of the family.
If there isn't enough, I could come back another Oh, no!
There's plenty.
Listen, I'm not gonna eat much.
I just want to watch.
Well, let's sit down everybody.
Yeah.
Let's sit down everybody so we can start eating and do less talking.
Yeah, we'll sit right down here.
Ladies, why don't you sit next to each other?
No.
Ladies Donna, you take my favorite seat right here.
I'll sit here between the two of you and that'll make it nice and comfy.
Did you and Fred know each other back in St. Louis Before we start, let us say grace.
But, Pop, we never pray before we eat.
Like my mother always said, "It don't hurt none.
" Dear Lord Dear Lord, we're thankful for what we're about to receive and protect us eaters, oh Lord, from bodily harm.
Amen.
That was very nice.
I didn't know you were a religious man.
I was I was born and raised a baptist.
And he'll die a baptist.
Did you and Fred know each other back in St. Louis?
- Well, you see - I had an uncle who was a Catholic.
I don't know if I told you.
He had water on his knee, that's why he had to give it up.
Did you and Fred know each other back in St. Louis?
No.
We just met this morning.
But it seems like we're old friends.
Right, Fred?
Donna, why don't you put some food in your mouth, and then I mean, you know, while it's still hot.
- How do you like living in L. A?
- It's been kind of lonely for me.
I didn't really meet any interesting people until I met Fred.
It's going to be really nice to have a friend.
Yeah.
Ain't nothing like having a good friend.
- You know who my best friend is?
- Bubba?
No, Jesus.
This food is delicious, Donna.
Isn't it, Miss Davis?
Oh, Carol.
Call me Carol.
Yes, it's very good.
Do you work as a cook?
No.
I happen to be a practical nurse.
Yeah.
Donna, she's a real angel of mercy.
Then you know Fred in a professional capacity?
A little.
But I happen to be his fiancé.
Fiancé?
You're engaged?
- Yes, didn't he tell you?
- No, he didn't.
How come you didn't tell her, Fred?
Well, you can't You can't just You can't just come right out and tell somebody everything the first time.
I was here for almost three hours.
Three hours?
You were here for three hours?
- Yes, didn't he tell you?
- No, he didn't.
How come you didn't tell her?
Why don't you tell me what you were doing for three hours?
I was providing him with a little genuine, female companionship.
Isn't that nice!
Although I'm surprised that at this stage in his life Fred still needs a mother figure.
Mother figure!
I don't have to sit here and listen to this shrewish woman's insults.
No.
Donna's not shrewish.
She's baptist like I am.
Are you going to sit there and let this woman call your fiancé names?
- Ask her to leave.
- Now wait a minute, ladies.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Ain't there enough trouble in the world with Vietnam and Cambodia and Jersey City?
Fred, I am your fiancé and I want to know what this woman was doing here for three hours.
- I just told you.
- I want him to tell me.
- What was she doing here?
- Let me tell you See, for three hours She was trying to She was just showing me She was showing me her line.
I can see you fell for it.
Oh, I'm getting out of here.
- He is all yours, Miss Davis.
- No, Donna.
Wait a minute.
- Oh, no.
I'm getting out of here too.
- Carol You're not passing off this no-good two-timer on me.
I guess they didn't hit it off, huh?
Yeah, and it's all your fault.
You dummy, you.
Donna!
Donna!
Carol!
Son?
Lamont?
Come get your dessert, son.
Lamont!
Come on down, son.
I got your pudding.
Yeah.
I'm gonna be putting this upside your head.
Yeah.
And when she found out I was from St. Louis she just invited herself over.
You don't think that I'd let some stranger come between us, do you, Donna?
No, really, Donna.
Listen.
I should have told her right away.
I should've just put my foot down, told her she couldn't come.
But you know, some people take advantage of you when you're Mr. Nice.
But I've learned my lesson, honey.
I swear.
I've learned my lesson.
See, when a man got you a woman like you he don't need to look at another woman.
I swear.
Thank you, honey.
I sure appreciate you forgiving me.
What's that?
Well, yeah.
How about tomorrow night?
Chinatown?
Okay, honey.
Bye.
Well, I hope you'll stop fooling around after this.
I still don't know why Donna's gonna take you back.
Because Donna knows she can depend on me.
Now who you calling?
Hello, Carol?
No, no.
Wait a minute, honey.
Don't hang up.
This is Fred.
Don't hang up.
I just want to apologize for last night.
Yeah, I've learned my lesson, honey.
Oh, when can we get together so I can explain?
What about tonight?
I got a whole magnum of"champipple.
" Sanford And Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Lamont!
What do you want?
- I want my breakfast!
- I can't hear you.
- I said I want my breakfast!
- Would you wait a minute?
Now what is all this yelling about?
I'm yelling about my breakfast.
You can make it supper now.
Would you just take it easy?
I was upstairs making the beds, Pop.
I only got two hands.
I'm doing the best I can.
Well, I ain't got but one stomach and it ain't doing too good.
Say, wait a minute.
Listen.
Will you go out and see if the paper's been delivered?
Yeah.
Say, wait a minute.
What paper?
We don't get no paper.
We cancelled our subscription, remember?
Well, the people next door get a paper, and I read it first.
Listen, I'm not gonna steal somebody else's newspaper for you.
That's not stealing.
I just get it, read it, fold it back up and put it back in front of the house.
What about that Life magazine I found here with our neighbor's address on it?
Now that's stealing.
It sure is.
And I'm not going out there and steal somebody else's paper for you.
That's right.
I don't need nothing.
I might as well be dead.
Why didn't you leave me there to die when I fell off that truck?
Cause you wasn't hurt bad enough to die.
All you had was a severe attack of clumsiness.
Clumsiness?
It's that sudden stop you made trying to duck that cat.
You know I was on the back of that truck trying to hold onto that junk.
How many times do I have to tell you?
That a cat ran in the street and I jammed on the brakes so I wouldn't hurt him.
Yeah, save a cat and kill your father.
It was instinct.
What would you have done?
Well, in the first place, I'd have thought to myself "It's either the cat or my father.
" Then I'd ask myself two questions: "Can the cat cook?
Can the cat do coordinating in a junkyard"?
No.
Okay, cat, you die.
Now you love cats, and you know it.
You wouldn't have done that.
Besides, it's better this way.
You're both alive.
Yeah, I'm all busted up and that cat's somewhere happy in a garbage can.
Do you want your breakfast, or you want to keep talking this nonsense?
I want my breakfast, lunch and dinner.
That's the least you can do for me, cat lover.
That's another thing we got to talk about.
It's not gonna work this way.
Me doing all the housework and taking care of you.
What's gonna happen to the business?
You want me to go back to work, huh?
Me with one leg and one arm.
Old Fred, the crippled coordinator.
I don't want you to go back to work.
But I gotta get back to work.
I gotta get back on that truck.
And leave me here to die, that what you want?
Okay, then prop me up in front of the TV.
That's all you do.
That's a good way to go.
Sittin' there watching Days of Our Lives.
Would you stop this and listen to me?
I'm not gonna leave you here alone.
I called up Aunt Ethel and asked if she'd come over and help us out.
Ethel?
I don't want her around here.
She's a lousy cook.
And her hands are sweaty.
Would you let me finish?
Now, Aunt Ethel can't make it.
So I called the employment agency and I asked if they'd send us a housekeeper.
- You mean a maid?
- Somebody that does housework.
All the stuff that I've been doing so I can get back to work.
You mean you're gonna leave me here with a strange woman?
- Well, what's wrong with that?
- What if she's a sex maniac?
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.
Oh, you don't think it could happen, huh?
Me being chased around the house by some weirdo.
It can happen all right, but you'd be the one doing the chasing.
Well, I don't care.
I don't want nobody around here anyhow.
No maids.
- Then I got one other suggestion.
- What?
- You go into a nursing home.
- A nursing home?
Well, if you don't want to have to see my no more then send me to a nursing home.
- What are you talking about?
- You don't know about nursing homes?
They're mean in nursing homes.
That's right.
Sam Turner's father was in one.
He told me.
- He told you what?
- He told me them nurses are mean.
He asked the nurse to help him to the bathroom and every day she helped him to the bathroom.
She got mad one night and took him in the bathroom and beat him up.
- Oh, come on, Pop.
- That's right.
Now, the only time he go to the bathroom is when his son comes to visit.
Once a week.
Sunday, between 2:00 and 4:00.
- And you believe that?
- Yeah, I believe it.
So, if you don't never want to see me no more, send me to a nursing home and sit there and wait for a telegram to come saying, "Fred is dead.
" But we gotta do something.
I haven't been out on that truck in over two days.
Why don't you work nights?
You mean go through the alley of a white neighborhood at night?
Do you ever want to see me again?
Well, if you hadn't tried to save that old cat, we wouldn't be in this fix.
Wish I'd of been driving that truck.
It'd been another story.
- Yeah, I know.
- The story would have been "Cat Killer Strikes Again.
" I hope that's the woman from the employment agency.
Let her come on in and attack me while I'm taking a nap.
- Aunt Ethel.
- Hello, Lamont.
- I thought you couldn't make it.
- I can't.
I just thought I'd stop by and see how you doing.
Well, Fred Sanford.
You are a sight.
Just look at you.
You look ridiculous.
Ethel, I fell off a truck.
What's your excuse?
Excuse me, Aunt Ethel.
- Fred, how could you be so clumsy?
- I don't want to talk about it.
Clumsy.
You've always been clumsy.
The day you married my sister, you stumbled on the way to the altar.
That wasn't no stumble, that was a hesitation.
I had to hesitate when I took a look at you and the rest of Elizabeth's family.
Don't you talk about my family.
I'll talk about your family.
Your family was the ugliest family in Detroit.
Then y'all moved to St. Louis and took over the championship.
Don't you talk about my family and my dead sister.
Your dead sister is my dead wife.
Now, don't you come here and try to break up my marriage.
I said it for years, "Get him out of the junk business.
Let him get a respectable job.
Like my Alex.
" - Your Alex got a respectable job?
- You know he has.
- He works in a bank.
- He mops floors at the bank.
Alex is a floorwalker.
That's what I said.
If you're going to mop 'em, you got to walk 'em.
Well, just look who's talking.
You don't want to better yourself.
You just want to stay here in this junkyard and keep that son of yours tied to your apron strings forever.
You are a selfish man.
Ethel, how'd you like one across your lip?
You know, I got one arm free, and I'll give you one across your lips.
- You better not try.
- If I wasn't crippled, I would.
If you weren't crippled I'd make you one.
Let me tell you something.
If you ain't out of here by the time I count to three I'm gonna take this crutch and wrap it around your head so many times you'll think you're wearing a wooden turban.
All I can say is falling off that truck serves you right.
Now you got a foot out of commission and a head to match.
I warned you!
What's going on?
Where'd Aunt Ethel go?
She had to hurry, son.
She had a crutch following her.
- What?
- Nothing.
Sit down.
What?
You know I don't like my eggs sunny-side up.
- Well, how do you want 'em?
- Over.
- What is this?
- What do you mean, what is that?
- Those are eggs.
Those are your eggs.
- Look like fried calves liver.
All right, so they got a little overcooked.
Overcooked?
Son, these eggs have been cremated.
I mean, black is beautiful, but not when it come to eggs.
Listen, are you going to start complaining again?
It's enough that I've gotta do all the stuff around here and take care of you without hearing your complaining.
If you don't like those eggs, you can limp in the kitchen and fix your own.
All right.
I'll eat 'em.
But remember that old saying "You are what you eat.
" So, I guess I'll make an ash outta myself.
You get that?
That was good, wasn't it?
See, I make an ash out of myself, so I put the ash I know.
Drink your coffee.
Listen here.
Son, these eggs, I don't know, but Wow.
Son, one thing I can say, you make a great cup of coffee.
That's cocoa.
I hope that's the woman from the employment agency.
That's gotta be her.
I don't want you to give her no trouble.
And don't let her give me no trouble.
Let the fiend in.
Hi, I'm from the employment agency.
You called for a housekeeper?
Excuse me for a moment.
- She's white.
- I can see that.
Look at them beady eyes.
A sure sign of a sex maniac.
Well, I finished upstairs.
I tell you Mr. Sanford you know what I almost said when I first saw this place?
I almost said, "What hit it, Hurricane Agnes"?
I tell you, that upstairs was a disaster area.
- Mind if I sit down?
- No, sit down.
- Mind if I smoke?
- No.
Just don't burn us down.
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
A five-minute rest will do me a lot of good.
I had to wait 45 minutes for my bus this morning.
Forty-five minutes.
And there's no bench at the bus stop, you know?
Then an hour's ride here.
I stood up part of the way.
My feet are killing me.
Say, Mary, uh, bet you don't take too many jobs like this, do ya?
I mean, you know, coming all the way down here to work for, uh, for black people.
Money's green.
Ajob's a job.
People are people.
Yeah.
I'm glad you feel that way, because some of my best friends are white.
Yeah, a fellow down the street named Goldstein.
He's a junk dealer.
He's a friend of mine.
And, uh, funny thing Goldstein is not only white, he's Jewish.
- Is that so?
- Yeah.
We ate together once.
- I think that's wonderful.
- Yeah.
A-And, something else, Mary.
I wouldn't want nobody to hear me say this but, I thinkJack Dempsey could have beatJoe Louis.
Do ya?
Yeah.
Now, don't get me wrong.
Joe was good butJack was a real slugger.
Real fighter.
And outside the ring, a real gentleman.
Yes, sir.
Real gentleman.
A credit to his race.
That's nice.
Well, coffee break's over.
Better get back to work.
- Yeah.
- Say, Mr. Sanford, are you comfortable?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Must get tired sitting there.
- Anything I can do for you?
- Nothing at all.
Say, why don't I give you a nice alcohol rub?
That'd make you feel good.
Mary, would you get me something cold to drink?
Oh, sure.
I'd be glad to.
What would you like?
Why don't you look in the refrigerator and see what we got?
- You got a Coke and some ice water.
- What?
- A Coke and some ice water.
- I'll take the Coke.
I'll take the ice water.
- That Coke slipped out of my hands.
- It's all right, Mary.
I'm so clumsy.
I don't know.
I don't know what I was thinking of.
Doesn't it make you mad when something like that happens?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- It's all right.
- If you want me to pay, I'll pay.
- Mary, Mary.
It's all right.
- You don't have to pay for nothing.
- Oh, okay.
Why don't you just take a rest?
You know what I mean?
No, no, no.
Not over there.
Over here.
Yeah.
See, you don't have to be doing something every minute, Mary.
- Yeah?
Okay.
- Just take a little second rest there.
You know what I mean?
I'm not a slave driver.
Yeah, well, I didn't sleep very well last night.
You know, this has been kind of a hard day on me.
Yeah, feels good.
I know how it is.
You have to get up early in the morning and get dressed.
Have a cup of coffee maybe.
Go down to the bus stop, catch the bus.
It's crowded, you got to push and shove, have the exact change.
By the time you get where you're going you got to be - What is it?
- The phone, Mary.
Don't tell me I dropped off.
I am sorry.
I'll get it.
Don't worry.
Hello.
Hello.
They hung up.
Well, Mary, from now on, can't you try to get the phone while it's ringing?
And You know what I mean?
One other thing, Mary.
Uh, see, people calling here they ain't used to a woman answering the phone.
So, could you say something different besides just hello?
- Like what?
- Well, what do people usually say?
You can say, "Sanford residence.
" If you say so.
Say, listen, I got to get to work out there in the kitchen.
I'd like to stay and talk, but I got a lot of work to do.
- Mary!
- What?
Phone, Mary.
I was going to get it.
I just couldn't hear with the water running.
- Yeah, okay.
- Hel I mean, Sanford residence.
Who?
Man wants to speak to a Fred.
- I'm Fred.
Who is it?
- Who is it?
Bubba.
What's a Bubba?
Bubba.
That's a friend of mine.
I'll get it.
Yeah.
He's coming.
Just wait a minute, Bubba.
Yeah, hold on.
- Can I help?
You want to lean on me?
- All right.
Now, listen, I'll be right out there in the kitchen if you need me.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Bubba.
Oh, no.
That's the lady that's working for us.
No, no, no.
Nothing like that, Bubba.
If I was well enough to do that, I'd be well enough to be back at work.
No, Bubba.
Listen, I gotta hang up, Bubba.
- Her name is Mary.
Mary!
- What?
- No, not you, Mary.
- I thought you wanted me.
No, Bubba.
No, she's not a sister.
Good-bye, Bubba.
That was Bubba.
He thought you were my sister.
- Bubba's not too bright.
- No, he's about my color.
Let me put this cushion under your elbow, it will give your Oh, wait.
Doggone it, I'm dropping everything.
I'm so clumsy.
Hi, Pop.
Hi, Mary.
How's everything going?
Everything's fine, son.
Everything's fine.
Mary and I were having a little chat, weren't we, Mary?
We've been having the nicest visit.
I better get back out the kitchen.
Yeah, Mary, nice talking to you.
We'll talk again later on.
Hear, Mary?
Son, we got to get rid of Mary.
- What?
- Yeah, we got to get rid of Mary.
- Isn't she doing her work?
- She don't do nothing.
And she's breaking my valuables and stuff, then she took a nap.
- She took a what?
- Took a nap on the couch.
We can't have our neighbors coming here, thinking a whole bunch of stuff when they see that ugly white woman asleep on our couch.
Oh, so that's what it is.
You wanna get rid of her 'cause she's white.
I don't care if she's plaid, I don't want her around here.
- Well, isn't she cooking dinner?
- Do you smell anything?
I'm telling you, son, let's get rid of her.
Get rid of her?
If we get rid of her, who's going to cook dinner?
- You, dummy.
- Mary, can I see you for a minute?
What can I do for you?
Mary, what are we having for dinner?
- Dinner?
Was I supposed to cook dinner?
- Yeah, you were supposed to.
Nobody told me that.
You see, I'm not a cook.
I'm just a housekeeper.
If you want a cook, you have to specify "cook.
" But I could do something for you?
What would you like?
- What can you cook?
- Well, do you like mutton?
- Do I like what?
- Mutton.
Do you like boiled mutton?
Does anybody?
Well, do you like pizza?
- Pizza, hey.
- Hey, can you make pizza?
No, isn't there a place around here that delivers?
And when you order, make mine without anchovies.
I never liked anchovies.
They're just too salty.
- Say, Pop?
What'll I tell her?
- What?
- Tell her she's fired.
- You can't do it that way.
That's mean.
Listen, you gotta beat around the bush.
You know, talk about the weather.
And then you get into it.
How about, "We sure could use some rain.
You're fired.
" You're a big help.
I guess I better go tell her.
Go on and tell her.
Tell her.
Say, Pop, let's both tell her.
Mary, can we see you for a minute?
What'd you do that for, dummy?
- The pizza come yet?
- Not yet.
That isn't what we wanted.
We-We sure could use some rain.
Yeah.
It's been dry lately.
I bet the farmers wish it would rain.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Say, Mary, if it rains tomorrow, you don't have to come.
You don't have to worry about that.
I've got an umbrella.
Mary, what he's trying to say is even if it don't rain, you don't have to come.
You're trying to tell me you don't need me anymore.
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah, that's it.
But we want you to know we appreciate your coming to help us out today.
- I'll go now then.
- Didn't I tell you how easy it was?
Hey, listen, did you give her a key to the house?
If you did, you better get the key back 'cause she might come back here one night and try to rip us off.
- Well, I'll be going now.
- Here's the money for coming today.
- Full salary, just like I said.
- And my bus fare.
Don't forget.
- I always get bus fare.
- Say, listen.
Why don't you take a cab?
- You don't have to do that.
- Yeah, You don't have to do that.
But you probably live a long way from here.
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
So I'll take it.
Thank you.
- Dummy.
- I've been thinking about what we were talking about, and I think you're wrong.
Joe Louis could have beat the hell out ofJack Dempsey.
Say, what was that all about?
Don't talk to me.
I don't want to talk about nothing.
- Where you going?
- I'm going and see what's missing.
Did you see that shopping bag?
What are you talking about, Pop?
Why would she steal from us?
Habit.
Habit.
They can't help themselves.
- Is there anything missing?
- I don't see nothing yet.
But there's something missing.
I'll bet it.
- This is ridiculous.
Why would she - No, it's not ridiculous.
I bet I'll find out something's missing.
Sometimes it takes two or three days to find out.
She ain't bonded.
Look at this Scotch.
See that mark I put on there this morning?
And look at how far down it is.
And you know why?
Mary the Guzzler.
Look at this.
You see that mark there?
I put that there last night.
Now it wasn't Mary the Guzzler, it was Freddy the Boozer.
I don't know why you're accusing somebody of stealing.
Hello.
Who do you want to speak to?
Yeah, he's here.
It's for you.
- Who is it?
- I don't know.
Hold it up.
You know I'm crippled.
Hello?
Oh, she just left.
It's the employment agency calling about Mary.
Hello.
Oh, yes.
She's a fine worker.
Yeah.
No, we won't be needing her anymore.
Oh, she was.
She was very nice.
Yes, and honest and clean.
And clean and honest.
And honest.
Yeah.
Oh, she worked out fine.
Made a nice bed and cooked a great boiled mutton.
Sure will.
Well, thank you very much.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Take it down.
Say, Pop, how could you say that after what just happened?
It's easy.
Let somebody else find out how bad she really is.
Where you going?
I'm going out here and see if the truck is missing.
- Well, so long, Pop.
- Where you going?
What do you mean, "Where am I going"?
I'm going to work.
- And leave me here alone?
- Listen to me.
Now, I just finished making the beds, I fixed your breakfast your lunch is on a plate in the refrigerator and there's nothing you need me here for.
Well, you can't leave me here all alone and by myself.
I'm helpless.
What if a burglar broke in?
And you know, they never did catch that Zodiac killer.
Where you going?
Who you calling?
I'm calling the employment agency to see if Mary's available to come over today.
Mary!
Look at here, put that phone down.
Don't call up Mary.
So you're not so helpless after all.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Got the world on a string Sittin'on a rainbow Got the string around my finger We ain't gonna make it, Pop.
We just ain't gonna make it.
Look at these bills.
We ain't gonna make it.
Don't say that.
We faced the first of the month before and we made it.
Yeah, but there finally comes a time when you know you ain't gonna make it.
What do you keep sayin' that for?
We got 30 bucks between us, and we got bills here that total over $200.
We ain't gonna make it.
If only you and Bubba hadn't thrown away that money at the racetrack.
Bettin' on a horse ain't throwing away money.
- It's like making an investment.
- Is that so?
Yes, that is so.
It's like investing in a piece of property.
Only thing is, this piece of property had a lot of lead in it.
Then what do you suggest?
Because we ain't gonna make it.
We gotta figure out something.
What do you think we oughta do?
Only thing I can figure out is to sell the best thing we got in the junkyard.
The best thing we got in the yard is a bathtub with a ring around it.
Well, let's pawn the ring.
That's right, make jokes.
But we in trouble.
We in big trouble.
We're in enough trouble to get on welfare.
Shut your mouth.
Fred Sanford on relief?
Never.
I might be broke, but I got my pride.
You want a bunch of white people prying in your business, lookin' under the bed?
What are you talking about?
Well, that's what they do look under your bed down your throat and up your mattress.
And while they're prowlin', your stomach's growlin'.
That's what the welfare thing is set up for, for people in financial trouble.
What do you think we pay taxes for?
We'd be taking advantage of something that was set up for people like us.
- What's that mean, "people like us"?
- Poor people, the have-nots.
The have-nots?
If the have-nots could get something from the haves Say the haves gave the have-nots half of what they have.
Then the haves would still be the haves but the have-nots would be the have-somethings.
Would you stop it?
What do you wanna do, go on welfare?
Is that what you wanna do?
I don't wanna go on welfare.
I'm just trying to figure a way out of this.
I'd rather do what I did back in 1932.
- Sell apples on the street corner.
- You want to sell apples?
No.
I can't sell apples with my arthritis.
Maybe I could sell some grapes.
- Maybe we could sell some blood.
- What?
The hospitals pay you for blood.
They ain't gonna get none of mine.
My heart's having trouble pumping the little blood I do have back and forth.
This blood ain't for sale.
It stays with the original owner.
Well, there they are.
The bill collectors have arrived.
I don't feel that way.
You know what?
My left hand is itching, and that's a sure sign of money.
- Aunt Esther.
- My left hand lied to me.
- Hello, Lamont.
- How you doing, Aunt Esther?
Oh, I'm just fine except for these broken-down knees and this crick in my back spots in front of my eyes, blood pressure rising.
Other than that, I'm just fine.
Esther, what do you tell people when you're sick?
- How are you, Fred?
- Well, I ain't half as dead as you.
If I felt like you and looked like you I'd go down to Forest Lawn Cemetery and hang around a while.
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Thank you.
And squeeze out a few of them grounds.
We might have another cup left.
Down and out again, huh, Fred?
You were a deadbeat the day my sister married you and you still a deadbeat today.
You know good and well the day I married your sister I was loaded.
You was loaded all right.
You were so drunk, you fell on the preacher.
I had to get drunk to look at your ugly family.
Don't you talk about my family.
I'll talk about your family.
For years, people goin' around saying, "Black is beautiful.
" They took one look at your family and say, "Hold everything"!
Well, that's something you wouldn't understand.
We have inner beauty.
- You have what?
- Inner beauty.
You better put your liver where your face is.
Fred Sanford, you are crude and evil and most of all you're stupid!
How'd you like one across your lip?
- Come on, try.
- Come on.
- Come on, Stumpy!
- Stumpy?
I'm tall enough to give you three of these in your nose.
Come on.
- Oh, no, you won't.
- Yes, I will.
Will you two stop it!
- Would you two stop it!
- Tell her.
I'm surprised at you.
You mean to tell me you'd hit a lady?
No, I wouldn't hit a lady, but I'd hit her.
- Here's your coffee, Aunt Esther.
- Thank you, Lamont.
Behave yourself.
Why you always come around here and wanna pick a fight with me?
I didn't come around here to pick no fight.
- I came here to ask you a favor.
- What is it?
I'd like to use your place for our Sunday morning bible meeting.
Who?
You mean, you and all them cackling sisters you always be with?
Uh-uh.
This a junkyard, not a henhouse.
All we planned to do was to drink some tea discuss a few chapters of Saint Paul, eat some homemade cookies.
The ladies were going to contribute for refreshments.
Why do your group want to meet here in my junkyard?
Well, number one, we try to bring the Spirit to those who need it most.
Uh-huh.
Number two, I felt it would be a good idea for Lamont's sake.
Keep going.
And number three, the places we usually meet in are unavailable.
Bingo!
- Well, do we get it or don't we?
- No, you don't get it.
Why you think you can come over here and I let you use my place?
I was moved by the words of the Good Book.
"He that asketh, receiveth.
And he that seeketh, findeth.
" That's Matthew.
Well, you have asketh and been turned downeth.
Now findeth someplace elseth.
That's Fred.
All right, Fred.
But I feel sorry for Lamont.
You raised him to be a backslider just like yourself!
Who you calling a backslider, witch?
I'm calling you a backslider because you do not believe.
I believe.
I believe I'm gonna knock you out of here 'cause you're ugly.
And what's more, you're an evil-minded, selfish old man!
Listen, Esther, if you ain't out of here by time I count to three I'll put a lump on your head, look like a wig on top of a natural on top of a wig.
And if you lay one hand on me I'll unscrew your arm from your shoulder, and beat your brains out.
You're a heathen, that's what you are!
A heathen!
A no-good heathen!
And you're gonna pay for your sins one of these days, you miserable old buzzard!
I'm sure glad she's gone.
Thought she'd never leave.
Listen, son, I think I've got a solution for our problem.
I got it from Madame Big Mouth.
Would you mind telling me what you're talking about?
You know, she said something about her sisters contributing for refreshments?
- So?
- So, that's what we do.
We invite a bunch of people, charge admission on the door and sell them some food and drinks, you know, like the old Harlem rent parties.
I thought you said you still had your pride.
Isn't that charity?
How's it charity?
I'm giving something for their money food and drink.
- I don't think much of the idea.
- You don't think much of it?
I can think of something myself, can't I?
What do you think?
First, where you gonna get the money to buy this food and drinks to sell?
- Didn't you say we had $30 between us?
- Yeah.
Do you know how much pigs feet, potato salad and beer you can buy with $30?
You can buy enough stuff to keep a whole houseful of people belching the weekend.
I don't like the idea of having a party.
Why not?
We can make a lot of money and have some fun doin' it.
I'll act as the host.
You know what I mean?
I'll greet the people.
How's that song go?
No use of sitting alone in your room - Come to the cabaret - Forget it.
- Life is a cabaret, old chum - Forget it.
Come to the caba Forget it?
Well, what do you want to do?
I think we ought to ask for an extension on all our bills.
You know, the gas, electric, heat.
If we can get an extension, if we can get two weeks, we'll be all right.
Well, listen, if we don't get it, then can we have the party?
We're not gonna need it 'cause we'll get the extension.
- Sitting alone in your room - Forget it.
- Come to the cabaret - Forget it.
- Forget it!
- Come to the cabaret Would you forget it?
Hello?
Oh, yes, it is.
I was just about to call you to ask for an extension.
- Who is it?
- It's the phone company.
They say if we don't pay the bill, they're gonna cut it off.
Gimme that.
Hello?
Yeah, this is Fred Sanford.
Yeah, the phone is listed in my name.
Listen, what makes you folks think you can cut somebody's phone off just because they're a little behind in their bill?
I need my phone for my place of business.
Right.
I wish one of you would come over here and try to cut my phone off.
I'll put my foot in your Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
It's dead.
That's just great.
Now what do we do?
No use of sitting alone in your room Come to the cabaret Come to the cabaret Sorry, buddy.
Upstairs is off-limits to the guests.
You see, upstairs is sleeping quarters for the establishment.
- I was just lookin' for the washroom.
- Didn't they tell you?
We made arrangements with the filling station on the corner.
Excuse me.
Say, brother, would you take your foot off my couch?
That's genuine vinyl.
Hey, pal, good to see you.
Enjoy yourself.
How are you, dear?
Pardon me, friend.
Don't put your ashes on my rug.
I'm sorry.
Where do you people come from?
How you folks?
Having fun?
Good.
Eat all you want.
Just leave some.
- Well, how you feel, folks?
- What is that you're wearing?
Tuxedo.
How do I look?
You look like a tall, gray-haired penguin.
I had this suit for 30 years.
Look at it.
There ain't a hole in it.
There's no holes in it 'cause the moths refuse to eat it.
You don't even know nothin', do you?
I married your mother in this suit.
Ain't had it on since.
Look there.
Still got some rice in the pocket.
You sure them ain't maggots?
You're not gonna wear that thing all night, are you?
Yeah, I'm gonna wear it all night.
People used to say I looked like Edward G. Robinson you know, Little Caesar.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm runnin' this place.
It's my place.
- Hi, Fred!
- Oh, darlin', you're just in time!
Wow, you're lookin' good.
Gimme that cape.
Yes, baby.
Yes, baby!
Say, darlin', just go on out there and mingle a little bit.
What is that?
What'd you think it is, a water buffalo?
That's Leslie Parker's niece.
She's our bunny.
You know, like a bunny at the Playboy Club.
She looks more like a rabbit from the Plowboy Club.
You really are ridiculous!
Hello, Fred?
Hello, Lamont.
Hey, Bubba, I'm Lamont and he's Fred.
Great!
Three of the nicest guys you wanna meet.
You like you already been to a party.
You're drunk.
Yeah.
I was celebrating the election results.
I was celebratin' McGovern gettin' elected.
What's wrong with you?
Don't you know that Nixon got reelected?
Nixon!
Now I'm really gonna have to get drunk.
Bubba, what you need is some food.
Why don't you get something to eat?
No, thanks, Fred.
I'm driving.
Come on in.
You're blocking the entrance.
- You won't even have to pay admission.
- You gonna let me in for free?
Of course.
You my best friend, ain't ya?
Yeah, yeah.
You're my best friend too, Fred.
- I've known you for 35 years - Don't start that.
Hey, bunny girl!
Bunny girl!
Help Bubba enjoy hisself.
Good evening, gentlemen.

Admission is one dollar payable in one big soft one, or a whole lot of little hard ones.
What they tryin' to do, crash the party?
Where's my baseball bat?
Wait a minute, Pop.
Don't start nothin' with those guys.
- They look kind of big.
- I don't care how big they are.
They're trying to crash the party?
Nobody crashes but me.
And I think I'll start with their skulls.
Say, pardon me, gentlemen.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I said it's a dollar per head.
Or would you rather me make that one baseball bat per skull?
- You in charge here?
You the owner?
- Yeah.
I'm also the owner of a baseball bat.
Can we go someplace where we can talk?
It's too noisy in here.
Look, we've had our talk, and the next noise you hear will be the rat-a-tat-tat of my baseball bat on your skull.
How 'bout in here, huh?

- Who are you guys?
What do you want?
We'll put it to you straight.
We want to be your partners.
Ain't but two people in this junk business me and my son.
We're not talkin' about junk business.
We're talkin' about the party business.
Look.
You got a good thing going here.
What we propose to you is that you use the junk business in front as a dodge.
You understand?
While the party is goin' on inside.
We'll have drinking, gambling.
Fun!
You understand?
- Fun!
- No, you fellows don't understand.
This party's just for tonight.
We're trying to raise money.
I know.
But I say, why stop?
Keep it going.
That way we make lots of money.
- Keep it going?
- Yeah, continuously.
with you as the host.
I can't do that.
I'm 65 years old.
That'll kill me.
- Then we'll have to get another host.
- No, listen.
Just forget about it.
I ain't interested.
What are you fellas, gangsters?
Y'all happy gangsters, ain't ya.
Now, here's the deal, partner.
We offer you our protection, just to make sure nothin' bad happens.
You can't open up no place here.
Not like that.
You gotta have a license.
A license?
Show him the license.
You in business.
Good.
I ain't never been in no trouble with the law, and this sounds like trouble.
Trouble?
Why?
Why?
We take care of everything.
Your nose is clean.
Yeah, my nose is clean, but the rest of my body's gonna need a bath.
- What's goin' on in here?
- He'll explain it all to you.
- Right, partner?
- What are you talking about, "partner"?
We're going into the party business together.
You got a good thing going here, but we're gonna make it even better.
We don't want no partner, so you can clear out of here right now because Hello, partners.
All right, we'll see you guys later.
Keep the party going.
Come on.
- Hey, Pop, who were those guys?
- They're gangsters.
They want to turn this place into a drinking and gambling joint.
That's ridiculous.
We can't do that.
I'm afraid we're gonna have to, son.
Remember?
He made us an offer we can't refuse.
Man, I didn't get no sleep at all last night.
- Where have you been?
- I went out for a walk.
What are we gonna do?
They're turning our place into the Sanford Hilton.
Bubba, what are you doing?
I'm lookin' for the bunny girl.
Hey, bunny, bunny.
Come on, bunny.
Where're you, bunny, bunny?
Come on, bunny, bunny.
I hope he finds her so he can stop drinking all that liquor.
- Oh, no!
- What is it?
Oh, come on, folks.
Please.
I knew this party thing wasn't gonna work out.
You and your moneymaking schemes.
Listen, maybe if we stay in the kitchen, they won't bother us.
That's great, Pop.
We're gonna live, eat, sleep in the kitchen with no bathroom.
Maybe I didn't tell you.
We made arrangements with the filling station on the corner.
That's right, keep making jokes.
But we're in trouble big trouble.
Hey, Sanford!
You back there?
Look at this.
Sanford, you ain't a very good host.
Look at this party.
It's dying here.
If you don't want to be in trouble, you better get out of here.
- This place is gonna be raided.
- What?
That's right.
This place is gonna be raided.
So if you don't want to be in it, you better get on out of here now.
You call the cops?
Is that what you did?
Huh?
Leave him alone.
You wouldn't hurt an old man.
Fred Sanford!
What is this?
- What's goin' on?
- Just what you see, Esther.
Why, this place is crawlin' with sin!
Yeah, ain't it?
We won't have our bible meeting here, not long as this is going on.
- Right, ladies?
- Amen!
- Who are they?
- These are Esther's Raiders.
And we have a bible meeting here this morning.
Well, we got a party goin' on here now.
And the party is over!
Get out!
- No, you can't throw us out.
- Oh, no?
- No!
- Get out!
Git, git, git!
Wait a minute.
I thought you said you called the cops.
I didn't call no cops.
Esther's tough as any cop and her mouth is bigger.
- Well, it worked.
- Yeah.
Come on, ladies.
We can have our bible meeting now.
Come on in.
- Come on in, Fred.
- You don't want me in there.
Oh, yes, we do.
Let's go.
Esther, I ain't going to no bible meeting.
That's it.
- That's what you think!
Get in there!
- Wait a minute!
Well, that's takes care of the gas, electric and the phone company.
And that clears us up for the rest of the month.
- How much you got left?
- Forty bucks.
Perfect.
$30 for the food we bought and $10 to get the place cleaned up.
Who's gonna charge us $10 for cleaning up this place?
I am.
- The door.
- You figured that out all by yourself?
- Come on in!
- Come on in!
The door's open.
See, you didn't believe that that party would work out, did you?
You ought to listen to me more.
I raised you.
- Good morning.
- Hello there, Aunt Esther.
Good morning.
Esther, what are you doing here this early?
Fred, my bible meeting friends appreciated you letting us use your place yesterday.
Think nothing of it, Esther.
I do unto others as others has did unto me.
And so I have a request.
We would like to meet here every Sunday morning.
Oh, no.
Uh-uh.
No, no, no.
Nothin' doing.
You can't do that.
Ain't no way.
Listen, Fred, if you don't let us have this place I'll have those hoodlums come back and take over again.
- You wouldn't.
- Oh, wouldn't I?
Just watch me.
What will it be?
Us or those gangsters?
What a friend we have in Jesus All of our sins and griefs to bear Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you will just follow me, please.
Watch your step on that cable.
Follow the center red line.
Try to stay together.
Gather round me, please.
This is the studio where we shoot The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.
Did you hear that?
This is where they shoot The Tonight Show.
I like that.
I like where that fella says, "Here's Johnny"!
What are you looking at?
That's what he says every night.
Ed McMahon says, "Here's Johnny"!
Would you stop embarrassing me?
I can't take you no place.
I'll tell you where you can take me.
You can take me home.
You're the one that's been bugging me for the last month to take you on a tour of a television station.
And you spoiling it for me.
What am I doing?
You're talking too much and embarrassing me.
That's what you're doing, and I want you to quit it.
- What I said aboutJohnny Carson?
- That's right.
Well, that's what Ed McMahon says every night on The Tonight Show "Here's Johnny"!
Would you stop it?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, if you will follow me, please I will take you out to the stars' parking lot.
- Oh, good.
All right.
- Did you hear that?
The stars' parking lot.
I bet that's where the stars park their cars.
That's terrific, Pop.
I guess you figured that out all by yourself.
If you had your own television show, your announcer would say "Here's Dummy"!
Please watch your step.
We are approaching the stars' parking lot.
Come all the way down here, please.
Now over there in the first space is where Flip Wilson parks his car.
Flip Wilson?
Flip Wilson parks his car right here?
Yes, sir.
That must be Flip Wilson's oil.
What are you doing?
I'm getting a little souvenir so I can show the fellas in the neighborhood.
I'll show 'em this handkerchief and say, "This is Flip Wilson's oil.
" Would you get back over here?
I'm sorry about the interruption.
And the space over here is whereJohnny Carson parks his car.
"Here's Johnny's car"!
Why don't you knock it off?
The car over here belongs to one of the guests appearing on Johnny's show tonight Lena Horne.
Lena Horne!
Wait a minute!
Lena Horne!
- Did you say Lena Horne?
- That's right.
Lena Horne's somewhere in this building right now?
That's correct, sir.
And now, ladies and gentlemen Wait a minute.
Look.
The Lena Horne?
I mean, the real Lena Horne?
Yes, sir, that's the one.
And now, folks, if you'll just follow me, please I will show you the NBC Commissary.
Did you hear that?
Do you know who's in this building now?
The Horne.
I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna be around you no more.
You've embarrassed me for the last time today.
That's it.
That's her name, and that's her door.
Five minutes, Miss Horne.
Miss Horne?
Anyone here?
Lena's mirror.
Last time Lena Horne looked in this mirror her face was right there where mine is now.
Lena's negligee.
Lena's body was in there.
Lena's brush and Lena's powder puff.
What are you doing in my dressing room?
It's her!
It's you!
Oh!
Oh, it's the big one!
You hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm coming to join ya, honey with Lena's puff in my hand.
What is the matter with you?
Hey, wait a minute.
Drink some water.
I didn't mean to startle you, but what are you doing in my dressing room?
Right now I'm having a heart attack.
- Shall I call a doctor?
- No.
It'll go away, then I'll leave.
But what Why are you in here?
Do you work here?
Are you with NBC?
- Yeah, I'm with NBC.
- Well, what do you do?
I'm an announcer.
- You what?
You're an announcer?
- You don't believe me?
No.
I don't mean to laugh at you, but I don't see you as an announcer.
I'm right in the middle of a rehearsal for a show, so I must get back.
Well, then I'll tell you the truth.
See, Miss Horne, I'm a fan of yours.
- I mean, a real big fan.
- Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
I saw your movie Stormy Weather 38 times.
You're joking.
You mean to tell me you paid to see Stormy Weather 38 times?
No, I only paid once.
I went in on a Saturday and came out on a Wednesday.
But see, that's not the real reason I came.
The real reason I came is because I promised my son I would try to see you.
You came here for your son?
Well, I don't quite understand you.
What does that mean?
Well, you don't wanna hear.
Well, all right.
If you don't wanna talk about it.
But if you wanna hear it, I'll tell you.
- All right.
- You sure you wanna hear about this?
- Really, I am in a big hurry.
- Okay, then I'll tell you.
See, my son is a big fan of yours too.
And his mother used to sing "Stormy Weather" when he was a baby.
Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky - I remember the song.
- Do you?
"Stormy Weather.
" Now the only time he hears her singing is in his dreams because she passed away.
Oh, I am sorry.
But why didn't you bring him with you to see me?
Well, ever since ever since that happened little Lamont hasn't been the same.
Well, what's wrong with him?
What's wrong with him?
Well what's wrong is I don't know where to start.
Doesn't he go to school?
Not anymore.
He's a drop-in.
You mean he's a dropout.
No, a drop-in.
He dropped in a few times and just quit.
Well, tell me, why is he so interested in me?
Well, like I said, his mother used to sing "Stormy Weather" to him and the only other person who could sing "Stormy Weather" like his mother is you.
So I guess he sort of looks on you like a substitute mother.
- Me?
Oh.
- Yeah.
This morning, you know, when he woke up he looked up at me with those big brown eyes and he said, "Daddy, you gonna see Lena Horne today"?
He said that so cute.
He said, "If you see her, would you tell her I love her"?
Oh.
What a shame that you couldn't have brought him here with you.
Well, the reason I can't - Can't you bring him here with you?
- No, he's I can't explain it.
- He's not lame, is he?
- Lame?
Yeah, that's what he is, lame.
Oh, I am sorry.
I'm so Do you think he'd like my picture?
Oh, that'd be so nice.
Here's one already signed.
Oh, this is really nice.
It's gonna really help.
See, in the morning when little Lamont wakes up I can hold this picture on the other side of the room and he can crawl out the bed to it.
- I do have to get back to rehearsal.
- I'm leaving.
And thank you very much for coming by, Mister Sanford.
That's S-A-N-F-O-R-D, period.
- Mr. Sanford.
Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.
- Thank you so much.
- Listen.
Tell little Lamont I said hello.
Yeah, and there's one other thing I promised him that I would ask you.
- Yeah?
- I couldn't.
Oh, but what is it?
- I can't.
- Well, all right.
Good-bye now.
Yes, I can.
You see, this morning, little Lamont sat up in the bed, he said, "Daddy, can you bring Lena Horne to see me"?
Oh, that's impossible.
I just can't do it.
You understand that.
I understand.
Big star like you got a lot more important things to do than visit little lame boys.
Mr. Sanford, that's not what it is.
Well, look.
First of all I've got to do this show.
Then, I'm going to do a benefit for Operation Headstart up in San Francisco.
So that means I've got to get right to the airport immediately.
Airport?
Well, my place is right out near the airport.
In fact, we so close, when planes fly over, we can see what movie's playing.
I'm sorry.
I can't manage it.
As it is, I'm going to be in a terrible hurry.
I promised little Lamont that I would give you the message so I'm giving you the message.
Miss Horne, Lamont Sanford loves ya.
Little lame Lamont.
Oh, wait a minute.
I'll come to your house.
- I'll come.
Yes.
Yes.
- You will?
You're not kidding me.
- You're not just saying this.
- No, but listen, only for a minute.
Just put your address right here.
I'll try to get there about 8:00.
Will little Lamont still be awake?
If you're coming over, I'll see to it that he is.
If you break your promise, you'll break his heart.
- No, I promise.
- Thank you so much and for the picture.
And thank you for saving my little boy.
I really appreciate it.
Where were you?
I've been looking for you for the last three hours.
Where was I?
Where were you?
You just took off with them people, left me standing there.
That's the last time I'm taking you anywhere.
Well, I'm glad you went off and left me 'cause the greatest thing happened, ever happened in my life.
- I'll bet.
- I ain't kiddin' ya.
You remember when they took us to show us whereJohnny Carson parked his car?
- Yeah.
- "Here's Johnny"!
Are you gonna start that again?
Right after you left, guess who I met.
- Johnny Carson.
- No, no, no.
A she.
The first lady of my dreams.
Pat Nixon.
If you're gonna be kidding around, I'll just go on and tell you.
You ready?
Lena Horne.
You met Lena Horne?
Pop, have you been in the applejack again?
No, I met Lena Horne, and not only that, she's coming here tonight.
What did you say?
You heard me.
Lena Horne is coming here tonight.
- You don't believe me?
- Oh, I believe you.
She's coming here accompanied by Duke Ellington's band theJackson Five and Chubby Checker.
Hi.
Remember me?
I know who that is.
Yeah, me too, it's Lena.
She couldn't wait to get here.
Hello, Lamont.
Hey, Luther.
What you all doing here?
Fred told us all to come over.
Yeah, come on in and have a little sit-down.
Get that chair against the wall, Billy.
Come on in, Arthur.
- Sit down there.
- What are you starting here?
A Gray Panther party?
Listen, if you don't wanna stay, you can leave.
I done rounded up everybody who was in the poolroom and brought 'em here like you asked me to.
- What's this all about?
- Yeah, what's going on?
It better be important.
It was my shot.
I thought you fellas might wanna hear about my tour of NBC today.
See here?
Look at that stain.
That's Flip Wilson's oil.
Fred, I know you ain't brought us all the way over here from the poolroom to show us Flip Wilson's oil.
No, I got some oil from Flip Wilson's car, and I met Lena Horne.
- You met Lena Horne?
- You don't believe me?
- Who is that?
- That's Lena Horne.
Wait a minute.
Where'd you get that picture?
Lena gave it to me.
You see it's signed.
That's a rubber stamp.
You probably bought that picture someplace.
You got about as close to Lena Horne as you got to Flip Wilson.
Well, I guess she'll have to tell you herself when she gets here tonight.
Lena Horne is coming here tonight?
Hey, Fred must have drank some of Flip Wilson's oil.
I wouldn't mind having a bit myself.
- I'll have a little taste.
- Yeah, give me a nip.
- I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
- What?
You don't believe she's gonna be here.
Wanna bet?
- Put your money where your mouth is.
- Put up or shut up.
Put your mouth on the floor.
I mean, money.
- You got a bet.
- I'm in.
- How much?
- Fifteen dollars apiece.
- It's a bet.
- Fifteen bucks.
- Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
- Stay out of this.
Fellas, when you get here tonight, make sure you bring your money.
Oh, we're gonna bring ours.
You just make sure you got yours, hear?
One other thing.
When you get here tonight hide outside and look through the window.
Nobody gonna be lookin' through no window.
- Why can't we come in?
- You got to stay outside.
Wait a minute.
I don't believe Lena Horne is coming here tonight or ever.
But just in case she does, why can't we all be here?
Tell her we're having a meeting.
No, listen.
If Lena Horne came here and saw you guys she wouldn't think it was no meeting, she'd think it was a mugging.
Outside!
- We'll be back, hear?
- All right.
- What's the matter?
- You flipped.
- You've flipped making a bet like that.
- So I flipped.
You can go upstairs and stay in your room when Lena Horne comes.
Don't bother to come down.
You want her all to yourself?
Just the two of you.
That's right.
That's right.
A man and his Horne.
Gimme that picture.
Would you listen to me, Pop?
Now even if you did meet Lena Horne today and even if she said she was coming here tonight - she said it to get rid of you.
- What do you mean?
Do you know how many people come up to her and ask for favors?
It happens all the time.
If she told you she was coming here tonight it's just to get you out of her hair.
- And you believed her.
- Yeah, I believed her.
Sure I believe her.
You wouldn't do that to me, would you, Lena?
You would never do that to me.
You know, kill my chances of making 75 bucks.
Hello, NBC?
I'd like to speak to Miss Lena Horne.
Thank you.
Lena wouldn't lie to me.
Lena couldn't lie to me.
Lena would never lie to me.
Why'd you lie to me, Lena?
Hello.
What?
Yeah, I know she's going to the airport but did she say she's gonna stop anywhere else on the way?
She never said anything at all about stopping anywhere else?
Straight to the airport.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.
"Sincerely.
" I bet that is a rubber stamp.
- Hello, son.
Where you been?
- Where do you think?
I was at the poolroom trying to talk them dudes out of that ridiculous bet.
- And?
- I couldn't.
You don't still think she's gonna show up, do you, Pop?
She said she was gonna be here.
Honest.
I ain't lyin'.
What time did she say she was coming?
- 8:00.
- Pop, it's 8:15 now.
She ain't gonna show up, is she?
What am I gonna do?
I should make you stay here and face them guys and pay up.
You know I ain't got no 75 bucks.
We'd better get outta here and go to a movie.
- When they get here, we'll be gone.
- That's a good idea.
There's a movie down at the Paradise Theater that I think you oughta see.
- What's the name of it?
- SnowJob.
I'm going upstairs.
There goes Lena.
Fellas are here already.
- Are you Fred Sanford?
- Yeah.
Excuse me a moment.
Oh!
Oh!
Please, please, don't have another heart attack.
- I didn't expect you.
- But I told you I'd be here.
- Didn't you believe me?
- Yeah, but, I just didn't - Are you all right now?
- Yeah, I'm okay now.
You know something.
You oughta do something about those heart attacks.
I am.
I'm saving up for a heart transplant.
Anyway, I've got to get that plane, so where's little Lamont?
Who?
Oh, yeah.
He's upstairs.
Shh!
- Oh, is he asleep?
- Yeah, he just went to sleep.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I could have helped put him into his jammies.
Yeah, he would have liked that.
Hey, Pop!
I think we'd better get outta here!
Pop?
Did he say, "Pop"?
Is that little Lamont?
Oh!
I think I'm having one, Pop.
My very first one.
And it's a big one!
You hear that, Mom?
Your little boy's coming to join you.
With a mustache!
Lamont, Lamont, this is Lena Horne.
- I know.
- This is little Lamont?
- What?
- Little lame Lamont?
What is this story you told me, Mr. Sanford?
I thought you had a little son.
I do.
He'll always be my little son.
Well, of all the low-down, rotten tricks.
Getting me out here by telling me you have a little boy who was lame.
- Lame?
- You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
You don't have to be lame in the leg.
You can be lame somewhere else.
- You told her I was lame?
- "Lame.
" That's what he said.
After I told you where I had to go and why I was in a hurry.
And now I'm gonna miss my plane, and it's all your fault.
Well, all I'm gonna say to you is thank you very much.
- Lena Horne!
- Yeah!
- It's really Lena!
- It's her all over!
Who are these, little Lamont's little playmates?
Fred, that is Lena Horne.
Man, you wasn't jivin'.
- You really did it.
- I knew her right away.
Well, good night, fellas.
Miss Horne has gotta get her plane.
Now wait a minute.
You won the bet.
We owe you 15 bucks apiece.
I got the money right here for all of us.
Yeah, a bet's a bet now.
Bet?
Did you say a bet?
Fred bet us 15 bucks apiece he could get you to come to his house tonight and son of a gun if he didn't do it.
- You low-down, rotten, lyin', jivin' - Wait!
Wait!
You gotta let me explain.
See, let me explain.
When you told me you had to fly to San Francisco to do a benefit for Operation Headstart I got to thinking I got some friends that might want to make a donation.
So to make sure they all had money when they got here, that's why I bet 'em.
And here's all the money right now with our compliments.
Where's your 15, Pop?
- Is this for real?
Really real?
- Yeah.
It's real.
Don't you love it?
Oh, what can I say?
This is wonderful.
Thank you very much.
Wait a minute, Miss Horne.
Here's my 15!
Say, Pop, aren't you coming to bed?
- Hey, aren't you coming to bed?
- Huh?
She was here.
- She kissed me.
- I know, Pop.
I was kissed by the Horne.
Listen, Pop.
You gotta get some sleep.
She was in this house.
She was standing right there where you are.
And she gave me one across the lips.
I know, Pop.
Come on.
Let's go to bed now.
- She was right here in this house.
- I know that, Pop, but she's gone now.
Yeah, she's gone but she was here.
I don't know why there ain't no sun up in the sky Stormy weather Sanford and Son was recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Fred, this reception's really bad today.
Yeah.
None of my glasses seem to work.
I can't even see the picture with these.
But I can see you all right, Bubba.
Look like you got a 24-inch mouth.
Glasses won't do no good.
It's the set.
You got to adjust it.
I guess you're right.
I'll adjust it.
This TV is just like my cousin T.J. You had to beat him to get him to go to work.
Well, I give up.
I've asked Lamont for a long time to get me cable TV.
Cable TVwould clear that picture up.
- Why won't he get it?
- 'Cause he's a cheap son of Hello, Lamont.
We were just talking about you.
And I got a good idea of what you were talking about.
- Cable TV.
I don't want to discuss it.
- But, Lamont No "buts.
" You want cable TV so you can watch old Frankenstein movies.
You ain't foolin' nobody.
I'm tellin' you, your days of leisure are over.
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf, and so are you.
What does that mean?
It means we're gonna get some ujima in this house startin' today.
- Some who?
- Some ujima.
- You ever hear of ujima?
- No, but I know Big Jima.
Yeah, she's a stripper over at that topless place.
Would you two listen to me?
Ujima is a Swahili word and it means "collective work and responsibility.
" That means that you're responsible for some of the work around here and you're gonna start living up to your responsibilities as of now.
Well, how do you say cable TV in Swahili?
You get cable TV and I'll ujima all over this place.
That's enough about cable TV.
I gotta go to work.
Odabo.
What'd you say?
I said odabo.
That's the Yoruba word for good-bye.
Well, what's Yoruba?
You don't know nothin', do you?
The Yorubas are blacks and there's over ten million of them in the southwestern corner of Nigeria.
Their ghetto is almost as bad as ours.
It's a country, Pop.
Why you speaking all this Yoruba and Swahili?
You have enough trouble with English.
Say, is this Swahili anything like pig latin?
It does sound a lot like it, don't it, Bubba?
Swahili is nothing like pig latin.
Talkin' to you and Bubba is like talkin' to two children.
There's work to be done.
Odabo.
You'll miss my huggin' You'll miss my kissin' You'll miss me, honey When I'm gone away Lamont?
Lamont?
That you, son?
Must be hearing things.
Gettin' old.
There's the truck.
Must be somewhere around here.
Lamont!
You upstairs?
Before you make any smart remarks, maybe I'd better explain something to you.
You don't have to explain nothin' to me.
But if you're walkin' down the street and some guy's following you you better walk fast.
I knew you was gonna have something smart to say about it.
I mean, what should I say if my son comes home wearing a dress?
Next thing, you'll be wearing panty hose.
Like on that commercial Our L 'eggs fit your legs They hug you, they hold you They never let you go This is not a dress.
This is a dashiki.
A dashiki is a traditional African shirt for men.
To me it look like a traditional dress for a woman.
Because you've been conditioned to judge everything by western standards.
I suppose there ain't no use in me trying to enlighten you.
I don't need to be no lighter.
That enlightening stuff went out with Conkaleen hair straightener.
"If your hair is short and nappy Conkaleen will make it happy.
" You don't want to know nothing, so I'm not gonna try to tell you nothing.
Listen.
What'd you say the name of this thing is?
A duck-shaker?
A dashiki.
It looks like a mattress cover to me.
- How much you pay for it?
- $13.
Thirteen bucks!
You paid 13 bucks for a cotton blouse?
Pop, this is a genuine import.
It came all the way from Africa.
I don't care if it came from Haile Selassie's closet.
It ain't worth no 13 bucks.
I mean, what's the use?
The whole world would come to an end before you'd even begin to understand anything.
I can understand this.
This ain't worth no 13 bucks.
You paid 13 bucks for a cotton blouse with no sleeves in it.
- Listen, Lamont - And don't call me by that slave name.
- What kind of name?
- Slave name.
The name of a slave that was handed down to him by a slave master.
- What are you talkin' about?
- What my name used to be.
Your name has always been Lamont Sanford.
Ever since I can remember, your name's Lamont Sanford.
You was named after Lamont Lomack.
He pitched 46 scoreless, no-hit, no-run innings in 1932.
And he wasn't pitching for no slave master.
He was pitchin' for the Homestead Grays.
Look, now, I know that, Pop.
But see, now I've taken a new name to reflect the new me.
Now, remember I was telling you I was gonna turn over a new leaf?
Well, my new name and my new clothes and my new language is all a part of that.
Oh, yeah?
Hmm.
Well, you see, Pop Now, I'm a black man, right?
You can say that again.
Come on, Pop, this is serious.
I should have a name, a language and clothes that lets everybody know that I'm a black man.
People would know you were a black man if your name was Spiro T. Agnew.
All they had to do was just look at you.
Would you listen to me for a minute?
'Cause this is really serious.
We shouldn't have these names.
Do you know any white people with names like Lumumba, Kasavubu or Tachaka?
I don't even know no black people with names like that.
That's just the point, Pop.
Black people in America have been cut off from their homeland for so long they don't even know the names of their ancestors.
My ancestor's name was Sanford.
My father's name was Sanford, his father's name was Sanford his father's father and their father we all been Sanfords.
And I've only been cut off of my homeland a little over 30 years.
And I suppose that's when your ancestors left Africa?
No, that's when I left St. Louis.
- I'm talking about before that.
- Before that?
That was ancient history.
No need to bring that up.
What we called ourselves before we called ourselves Sanford is the thing that's important because that reflects where we originally came from.
That's why I've chosen a name that leaves no doubt about my origin.
Well, what's your original new name?
Kalunda.
- Ka-who?
- Kalunda.
If you think I'm gonna change the sign from Sanford and Son to Sanford and Kalunda, you crazy!
Well, you better get used to it 'cause I ain't answering to Lamont no more.
- Listen, Lamont - Not Lamont.
Kalunda.
Kalunda.
Say it.
Calendar.
Hey, man, just say it right.
Come on.
Kalunda.
- Kalunda.
- That's it.
Kalunda.
I just need more practice.
"I'd like you to meet my son, Kalunda.
" "Package for Mr. Kalunda.
" "Call for Kalunda"!
That sounds Italian.
You sure that's African?
It's Congolese.
You see, I met this Nigerian sister and she told me I look like a member of the Baluba tribe one of the largest tribes in the Congo.
Kalunda.
It just don't sound right for a junk dealer.
With a name like Kalunda, you should be driving an elephant, not a truck.
Listen, you'll get used to What's that I smell?
It smells like sausage.
Yeah, that's your favorite lunch sausage sandwiches and potato salad.
I'm not eatin' that.
That's pig.
That's not pig.
That's sausage.
- It came from a pig.
I'm not eatin' it.
- Good.
There'll be more for me.
- You're not eating it either.
- Yes, I am.
Gimme them sausages.
Wait a minute, Pop.
Now, it's a proven fact that the human body was not designed to digest pork.
It's full of fats and cholesterol which leads to clogged arteries and heart attacks which could kill you.
If you eat them sausage, it's the same as taking poison.
Well, I'm gonna make me a nice poison sandwich.
Gimme them sausages.
Wait a minute.
Come over here now.
From now on, Pop, we gonna start eatin' righteously.
Which means that no more pig is to be brought into this house.
- No more pork chops?
- Bacon either.
Ham, spareribs, pork roast.
Pigs feet, pig ears, neck bones none of that stuff.
"Strikalene," fat back, salt pork, lard.
- No more chitlins?
- No more chitlins either.
Listen, what are you What are you trying to do?
Starve me to death?
Why you changin' the way you dressing, gettin' that weird name and stuff and then putting me on an immediate crash diet?
That's how change is supposed to come about, Pop fast.
If I had to be struck by lightning I'd rather be struck a little bit at a time than all at once.
Forget it 'cause we not gonna eat pork.
I've got friends coming this evening.
I'll drop you at the supermarket so we can get some decent food in this house.
I made out a shopping list.
I want you to take this.
Come on, let's go.
But, son, wait a minute.
What about them sausages?
That's pig and I want you to get rid of it.
Now, let's go.
Hey, Pop, what are you doing in there?
I'm gettin' rid of the pig.
And he won't even let me eat no pork or nothin'.
You ought to see some of the stuff he asked me to buy.
You know, like fruit and sunflower seeds stuff that you'd feed to a hamster.
I wonder what got into Lamont anyway.
Well, he just say he wanted to prove once and for all that he's black.
You mean, he's been tryin' to pass?
No, Bubba.
He just wanted to trace his ancestors back to prehistoric times, like even before there was a United States.
- I know where my ancestors come from.
- Where?
- Now it's called Memphis, Tennessee.
- Oh, Bubba.
Bubba, thanks for helping me home with the groceries.
Gimme that.
Get the door for me.
- I'll see you later.
- All right.
- What?
- Bye.
Hey, Lamont.
What is going on here?
You going trick-or-treatin'?
What is this?
A man's home is supposed to reflect his culture.
Well, if you want to reflect my culture put up a picture of Billy Eckstine and Joe Lewis.
- Did you get all the groceries?
- I didn't get everything.
I got the mangos and the fruit.
They didn't have no coconuts and them almonds.
Listen, what these friends of yours got, a pet monkey?
No.
Well, I got as much of the stuff as I could.
I don't know what there is.
I was gonna ask you to make fresh fruit salad, but I don't think we have time.
- Did you get the sodas?
- Yeah.
What kind of friends do you got that you goin' through all this trouble for?
Oyamo and Olaiya.
Your mama and who?
Oyamo and Olaiya.
Well, is that a man and woman, or two men or Oyamo is the brother and Olaiya is the Nigerian sister I told you about.
Now, you know Oyamo.
I don't know.
All the people I know got ordinary names.
Like Bubba, and Leroy and Skillet.
You see, Oyamo used to be named Rollo.
- You mean, we lost Rollo?
- Now Rollo is named Oyamo.
And it's through him that I met sister Olaiya.
Well, if Rollo's connected with it, it's a racket.
Why are you saying that, Pop?
He's serious about his Africanism.
Well, if there's some money to be made, Rollo would become Eskimo.
Now, listen.
Oyamo and Olaiya will be here soon.
And I want you to be nice to her.
In Africa, it is a cardinal sin to be inhospitable.
Well, if she's dumb enough to be with Rollo she's dumb enough to be in the hospital.
You go upstairs and change while I put the rest of these groceries away.
- Change?
Change for what?
- So that you look presentable.
In Africa, you would not receive guests looking like that.
If I was in Africa, I'd change.
This is Central Avenue, so this is it.
It's too late.
They're here.
Listen.
Try to remember what I said, Pop.
- And please don't embarrass me.
- I ain't gonna embarrass you.
- Try to be cool.
You know, sit there - I'm all right.
Hey, you think you can remember my African name?
It's like a cigar Belinda.
- Kalunda.
- Close.
- Bye.
- Pop!
I'd like to introduce to you my father, Mr. Fred Sanford.
How do you do, Mr. Sanford?
I am Olaiya.
Well, it's probably the water.
Shall we all sit down?
- Guess I'll go to bed.
- Would you sit down!
I'm sleepy, Lamont.
I mean, Kolumbo.
You have some very interesting pieces here, Mr. Sanford.
Yeah.
I coordinated all this stuff myself.
He brought that jungle junk here this afternoon.
Uh, Pop, why don't you offer our guests some refreshments?
- Do I have to remind you of everything?
- Yeah.
Got fruits and nuts.
I'd bring you some but promise you won't drop the shells on my good rug.
Thank you very much.
I got a mango too, but it's overripe.
So I'll cut the rotten part off and fix it up for you.
Excuse me.
I'll go and help him.
Kalunda is very disrespectful to his father, isn't he?
Is this the way he speaks to him all the time?
Every time I come here.
He's very disrespectful.
Ladies first.
No, root beer.
Asante is Swahili, and it means "thank you.
" That's pig latin for "you're welcome.
" What is this how do you say, pig latin?
It's nothin'.
It's childish, dumb talk.
It is not childish, dumb talk.
It's sort of language with a code.
So if you want to talk about somebody, and they don't know it you can say what you want to 'cause they don't understand it.
Oh.
Then it is similar in concept to Swahili.
It also was, as you say, made up of several African languages so that the many African nations on the continent could speak to each other.
You know, I didn't know we had that much in common.
And besides, you're a beautiful lady.
Yeah.
C'est si bon.
Pop, you said you wanted to go to bed.
I think now would be a good time.
I'm not sleepy.
I'm enjoying myself.
I wish I had met you 30 years ago when I had, when I had hair.
Before I had this hole in my natural.
I like you just as you are, Mr. Sanford.
Yeah, but 30 years ago I had a head full of hair and I had it slicked down like Cab Calloway.
You know, I had it fried, dyed and laid to the side.
What are you bringing all of this up for now?
Here we all are into a discovery about Africa and you're talking about slicking down your hair to look like white people.
I ain't sayin' nothin' about no white people.
I said Cab Calloway.
He ain't white.
- Why don't you just go to bed?
- I ain't sleepy.
You go to bed.
Then why don't you sit here, be quiet and stop making a clown out of yourself?
- You might learn something.
- Oyamo, I think we should be leaving.
Don't leave on account of my father's behavior.
He always acts like this.
It is not your father's behavior, brother Kalunda.
- It is your behavior.
- Me?
What did I do?
The way you talk to your father is deplorable.
No, it It is inexcusable.
In my country, such behavior is unheard of.
You would be beaten.
I wish I had you in Nigeria.
I'd knock you out.
Brother Kalunda it is not your place to chastise your father.
You must respect your father for he is full of years and wisdom.
You must not forget who is the parent and who is the child.
Listen to her, dummy.
Go ahead, honey.
Therefore, it is your duty to make his life pleasant, not unpleasant.
A child should strive to make his parents' winter years like spring.
And this child made my winter years one long blizzard.
As he provided for you when you were a child and could not provide for yourself so must you provide for him now.
And you're not only beautiful, you smart.
Brother Kalunda you have far to go along this path you have chosen for yourself before you reach your destination.
Do not mistake dashikis and sculpture and a hairstyle for Africa, because they aren't.
Nor can you expect merely to put on that cloth and become such a man as your ancestors were.
The clothes you can put on and off.
It is the heart you must change.
The heart.
Good evening.
Good evening, Mr. Sanford.
I enjoyed meeting you.
You are a man of joy and great depth.
And you're a beautiful lady.
Hey, if I was ten years younger I'd give you a run for your money.
You be nice to her, hear?
Have no fear, Pops.
Odabo, Jack!
Ah, she's nice.
You know, there's more to this African thing than I thought there was.
I'd go along with you on it, Kalunda.
I mean, you know, you can depend on me.
Say, did you hear me?
I called you Kalunda.
Hey, Kalunda.
The name is Lamont.
You mean, I don't have to call you Kalunda no more?
Hey, man.
You can call me what you always call me.
Oh, then, that'd be easy.
Dummy.
Hey, Pop, you got my breakfast ready?
What are you wearing that for?
Well, I knew you wasn't gonna wear it no more, so I thought I'd slip it on.
Make me feel real African.
I look chic in my dashiki.
Listen, Pop, if you gonna make fun of that, then don't wear it.
I'm not makin' fun.
Didn't I tell you that there's a whole lot to this African stuff that I didn't realize before.
And I like that part where you must not forget who is the parent and who is the child.
I kind of figured you would.
And how it's your duty to make my life pleasant, not unpleasant.
You can make my life pleasant with just two words cable television.
Are you back on that again?
Because I have already explained to you that I'm not gettin' no cable TV Hold it, hold it!
It's not your place to chastise your father.
You must respect him because he has years and wisdom.
Now, about that cable television.
You can forget about cable TV.
Anyway, what are we having for breakfast?
Whatever we having is somethin' that we gonna have from now on.
Sausages.
If you're really serious about your Africanism you wouldn't be eatin' them sausages.
You don't have to be a fanatic.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
I had plenty of money in 1922 Let other people make a fool out Hey, Lamont!
How you say you wanted your eggs?
I want 'em fried, straight up!
Uh, how 'bout scrambled?
- I want 'em fried!
- Scrambled's good too.
How come I can't have 'em straight up?
'Cause I dropped one on the floor straight down.
Why don't you do right Like some other people do - Oh, no!
- What's the matter with you?
The truck is gone!
Somebody stole the truck!
I'm gonna call the police.
Relax.
The truck's not stolen.
Somebody borrowed it.
- What?
Who did?
- I loaned the truck to, Julio.
Julio?
You loaned our truck to a Puerto Rican?
What difference does it make what the man is?
He needed the truck and I loaned it to him.
I'll tell you what difference it makes.
They don't return stuff.
What are you talking about?
I'm talkin' about how Puerto Ricans borrow stuff and don't bring it back.
They borrowed Harlem, remember?
And I'm sure they'd be glad to return it.
Well, you can just kiss that truck good-bye.
You know how bad they drive.
What is this?
They don't return things.
They don't know how to drive.
- What are you, a bigot?
- No, I'm a Baptist.
I never thought it was possible.
I'm the son of a bigot.
Just hush right up.
I'm just a fella that likes to protect his property.
What'd Julio need the truck for anyway?
I don't know.
He said it was a surprise.
Yeah, I know what that is.
He's probably smuggling in a truckload of Mexicans.
Pull that canvas back, and there they are, a whole lot of wetbacks.
And they say, "Surprise"!
You don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, yes, I do.
It's either that or he's smuggling in some Tijuana tobacco.
You know, "EIJoint-os"?
Why don't you knock it off?
Now, the man doesn't have a truck.
I loaned him ours.
He had some work to do.
You loaned the man our truck to cut into our business then there goes the empire.
What empire?
What empire?
This empire!
I built up from the ground from nothing' to what you see now.
Look, Pop, just knock it off.
We don't even need the truck.
It's Sunday.
And the bible says, "On Sunday thou shall rest.
" That means, thou shall rest, I shall rest and my truck should also be resting.
You're gonna keep griping all day 'cause I loaned that truck toJulio?
Yeah, that's right.
'Cause I don't trust him no further than I can throw a ten-ton banana.
Pop, Julio happens to be a very honest guy, and he's generous.
I bet he even filled the tank.
Yeah, with goat's milk.
I don't want to listen to no more of this.
I'm gonna have my breakfast.
I bet that's Julio now with your old, dumb truck, and we'll get some peace.
I bet it's the highway patrol.
You get it.
'Cause I wanna be sitting down when they tell me my truck went off a cliff.
- Hey, Julio!
- Hey, Lamont.
¿Cóme está?
- How you feel, buddy?
- Buenos días, Mr. Sanford.
Yeah, I know what that means.
Call your insurance company.
- Julio, is everything okay?
- Perfecto, man.
Here's the key, and I want to thank you very much.
That truck was really a big help.
And now I tell you the reason why I borrowed the truck.
Whaa!
I got a big surprise, man!
You brought the truck back in one piece.
Sure.
By the way, to show how much I appreciate, I filled the tank with gas.
- Julio, you didn't have to do that.
- Oh, yes, he did.
Hey, con permiso.
Excuse me.
I'm coming right back with the surprise, man.
- It ain't here on the headlines.
- What are you doing?
I'm trying to see if there was a riot yesterday 'cause if it was a riot that surprise could be a truckload of hot televisions.
Listen, you.
I want you to stop insulting Julio.
You got that?
Either that or he's smuggling something in to the country.
Wetbacks.
Lamont, Mr. Sanford, I want you to meet my mother Providencia, and my sister Maria.
Ha-ha!
They just came in from New York.
Buenos días.
I'm happy to meet you, Señor Sanford.
My son tells me that you too are un comprado de hierro viejo.
No, no, I'm a citizen.
No, señor.
Comprador de hierro viejo is a junk man.
What'd she say?
Mommy said that she has never seen an indoor junkyard.
Yeah, your your mama's really funny.
A regular Caesar sombrero.
Uh, shall we all sit down?
Did you come here for a visit, Mrs. Fuentes?
Yes!
I dream of coming to California for years!
Maria too!
Oh, yes!
Julio writes that flowers grow all the time and that people keep a tan all year long.
Oh, that's just in this neighborhood.
- Have you folks had your breakfast yet?
- Sí, thank you.
I'll tell you what.
Maria, why don't you help me unload the truck?
- I'll help you, Julio.
- Great.
Mommy, why don't you stay and get acquainted with Mr. Sanford?
No, no.
Wait a minute.
Why don't we all help unload the truck?
No, Pop.
Let the young people do that.
You stay in here and converse with Mrs. Fuentes.
No, no.
Wait a minute, son.
Wait a minute.
- You sure you won't need more help?
- Would you go sit down and talk to her?
- Talk to her about what?
- I don't know.
Talk about the weather.
Who wants to know about the weather in Puerta Rico?
Say, you come out here on the bus?
Oh, no, señor.
We fly.
And it is so fast.
We get into the airplane and boom, boom, we are here in five hours.
Well, they say it's much faster going back.
You get in the airplane, and boom, boom, you back home in four hours.
How long you gonna stay out here?
I don't know, señor.
Julio wants us to stay for good.
Oh, I'd think about that if I was you.
I mean, it's all right for a visit but I don't know about living out here.
Why?
It is bad to live here?
Oh, very bad.
- Look how dirty them windows are.
- You do not do windows?
No, I'm talkin' about smog.
That's smog.
We have smog in New York.
Yeah, but out here our smog is mixed with earthquakes.
See, out here a building will fall on you and your last breath won't even be a good one.
I will get used to it like everybody.
I'll tell you one thing you don't get used to the mayor.
Did you ever hear of Sam "Airplane" Yorty?
Did you ever hear of John "Garbage Strike" Lindsay?
You know who will be unhappy out here?
Is your daughter.
Maria?
She could hardly wait to come to California, señor.
Well, does she have a boyfriend back in New York?
Mmm.
Poquitos.
See now, there's a problem right there.
There ain't many poquitos out here.
What do you mean?
If she was lookin' for a steady.
Or a sweetheart.
- How do you say that?
- Ah, sí.
Un novio.
Novio.
Yeah.
See, in this neighborhood, our novios is black-eos.
Well, I do not worry about Maria.
She is smart.
She will do the right thing.
Get that killer out of here!
- Hold that killer!
- This must beJulio's goat.
Tell him something in Puerto Rican.
Tell him el goat-o get out of el house-o.
- Get him out of here.
- Don't worry.
He won't do anything bad.
I don't want to give him time to try.
Out-o!
- Hey, what'd she say?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
What I think she said was that you and the goat got the same beard.
Right?
I'm sorry.
Your mama got off another good one, didn't she?
- A regular Puerto Rican Phyllis Diller.
- We have to go.
By the way.
Thank you, Mr. Sanford, for being so nice to my mother.
Adiós, Mr. Sanford.
Come on, chico.
Well, that's it.
He had the truck.
- He brought his family.
The end.
- What's that supposed to mean?
It means we don't have to have nothin' more to do with him.
Just like the old saying: "East is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet-o.
" And that's the way you want it?
That's exactly the way I want it.
You can't be too nice to them Puerto Ricans.
Next thing you know, there'll be another Puerto Rican family move in here.
Then another one and another one.
And then what you got?
Harlem West.
You can do what you wanna do, but I plan on seeing them.
As a matter of fact, I'm taking Julio's sister out tonight.
What you say?
You heard what I said.
I'm taking Maria out to dinner.
Oh, this is the big one.
You might as well stop that right now because it's not gonna do any good.
Son, you can't go out with her because she's a, she's a She's a what?
Go ahead, say it.
She's what?
She's She's a foreigner.
I'm still going out with her.
Oh, son, don't do that.
I got a heavy feelin' right here.
It'll pass.
I'm going and eat my breakfast.
Oh!
This is the big one.
Hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm comin' to join you, honey with an enchilada on my heart.
What's the matter with you?
Take that thing out of your mouth.
You know what's the matter with me, and you know what's makin' me sick.
You wouldn't happen to be sick because I'm taking Maria out to dinner tonight, would you?
No.
I just got this fever.
I'm real sick.
Look at that 108.
Pop, if your temperature was 108, you'd be dead.
Then I'm glad I won't be livin' to see you take her out.
What's the matter with you?
Julio happens to be a friend of mine and his sister's in town for the first time.
As an act of friendship, I'm taking her out to dinner.
What's wrong with that?
It's wrong.
It's just wrong.
And it's dangerous.
- Dangerous?
Why?
- You could be attacked by sharks.
- What are you talkin' about?
- Remember that movie, West Side Story?
The Sharks was a gang of Puerto Ricans.
And they got that guy for taking that Maria out.
And he was Irish, so you can imagine what's gonna happen to you.
You really talk strange sometimes.
What is this, "Sharks"?
There're hardly any Puerto Ricans in Los Angeles.
They'll ship 'em in from New York.
I don't have time to stay around and listen to this.
I'm going.
Wait a minute, Lamont.
Wait a minute.
I'll tell you why I don't want you to go out with her.
All right.
What if Bubba, Leroy and Skillet see you.
They ain't as broad-minded as I am.
- Yeah, you're pretty broad-minded, Pop.
- You know I'm broad-minded.
Remember that time that white woman came in?
Didn't I let her use the toilet?
Terrific.
Look, I'm gonna take Maria out to dinner tonight.
I don't care what they think.
I don't care about Bubba, Leroy or Skillet.
I don't care about them.
Well, what about me?
Don't you care about me?
Of course I care about you, Pop.
But you still haven't given me one intelligent reason why I shouldn't take Maria out.
Okay, I'll give you an intelligent reason.
Remember that movie, The Great White Hope?
You remember all the trouble JackJohnson had with that white woman?
They threw him out of the motel in the middle of the night and they wasn't even drinkin' or playin' the TV loud.
- Come on, Pop.
- Yeah, see.
You and her won't even be able to get an apartment in Beverly Hills.
What's wrong with you?
You got us married and living in an apartment.
And all I'm doin' is taking her out to dinner.
I gotta split.
Wait a minute.
Where you gonna take her?
You know that Chinese restaurant, Chung Lee?
Well, listen, why don't you take her to a drive-in?
That way you won't even have to get out of the car.
- Good night, Pop.
- Wait a minute, son.
Take her to one of them nice taco places, and she can teach you how to eat a taco without the filling falling on the floor.
- Good night.
- Wait a minute.
Julio, what are you doing here?
- I just came over to thank you, man.
- Thank me for what?
I didn't want to do it in front of Maria because it might embarrass her.
But I want to thank you for the nice things you're doing for my sister.
You don't have to thank me for that.
I'm gonna enjoy taking her out.
- What's the matter?
Are you sick?
- I'm real sick.
That's too bad.
That's funny because my mother is sick too.
She is?
She was all right this morning.
I know.
But all of a sudden she got a fever, man.
Whoo!
She's probably sick for the same reason I'm sick.
Because this dummy's taking your sister out.
- Well, let's go, Julio.
- Wait a minute.
Listen, Mr. Sanford.
What's wrong with Lamont going out with Maria?
Never mind, Julio.
Let's go.
I would like to know what is wrong with your son going out with my sister.
- You don't know?
- No.
- What?
She's not pretty enough?
- No.
- She's not old enough?
- No.
Maybe, Mr. Sanford, it is because she is a Puerto Rican.
Sí, señor.
No, no.
Do you know what you are, Mr. Sanford?
You are a persona fanática.
That is Spanish for bigot.
Well, how would you like one across your lip?
That's English for "How would you like one across your lip"?
No, no.
I'm gonna tell you something else, man!
I gotta tell you something, man.
You know what?
Yeah, that's right.
No, you have to find out about this, because your head is old-fashioned, man.
It is anticuado.
You better get out of here before I peel your anticuado.
No, no, no.
Listen.
I tell you what, man.
I didn't tell Lamont he has to go out with my sister.
- That was his own idea!
- Well, that was a dumb idea!
Oh, yeah?
If it is such a dumb idea, you don't have to take her out.
What's the matter with you?
I ain't sayin' nothin'!
I didn't come over here for people to insult my sister!
No, no, no.
You don't have to take her out.
That's all.
See if I care.
Hey, Pop, why Julio, I You anticuado!
Wait a minute!
Lamont!
Here we are.
Beef with Chinese vegetables.
Lobster Cantonese.
- Fried rice.
Okay?
- Okay.
Wow, look at all this food.
Who's gonna eat all this?
You know what they say.
You eat Chinese food, an hour later you're hungry.
You know what I always say?
Eat for an hour, then you won't be hungry again.
That's terrific.
That's really good.
Eat for an hour.
- Dig right in there and help yourself.
- Thank you.
Lamont, I want to thank you for taking me out like this.
My first day in Los Angeles, and I've got a date already.
That's okay.
Maybe after dinner we can drive up Pacific Coast Highway and let the wind blow through your hair.
- That sounds nice.
- Yeah.
Wait a minute.
You don't have a convertible.
No, but if you roll the windows down on the pickup, it's the same thing.
Good evening.
How many in your party?
Just one.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't have a table for one.
- Why so crowded tonight?
- Saturday night always crowded.
Jewish people like to eat Chinese food on Sunday.
Why is that?
Don't ask me.
I'm notJewish.
Hey, you got something in the back?
Oh.
Maybe I give you table six.
Yes, you come with me.
- You mind sharing a table with somebody?
- No.
I don't care.
Excuse me, lady.
We very busy tonight.
You mind share table with gentleman?
- You!
What are you doing here?
- The same thing you are doing.
Oh, you two friends.
That's good.
What do you mean, the same thing?
How do you know what I'm doing here?
- You come here to watch your son?
- Yeah.
- I come here to watch your son too.
- What does that mean?
I watch to see they do not get serious.
The minute he takes her hand and looks into her eyes I will jump in and say, "Basta.
" What'd you call my son?
I say, "Basta.
" Enough.
Enough?
I'm sorry my son was dumb enough to go out with your daughter.
And I don't know why my daughter is dumb enough to go out with your son.
It is as if she has no good cerebro.
Just keep your daughter away from my son.
If she likes our people, let her start at the bottom.
Let her get a high yellow and work up.
Do you know what you are, Señor Sanford?
You are a mentecato.
That mean "fool.
" And you are an old mentecato.
- How you say "lips" in Spanish?
- Labios.
Labios.
How'd you like an old mentecato to give you one across your labios?
It is a good thing we are not in New York where her friends could see her.
I wish they were in New York so that my friends couldn't see my son out with her 'cause it's gonna ruin his reputation in this neighborhood.
Well, would you look who's here!
Hello, Fred.
Look, Skillet, it's Fred.
Hello, Fred!
Man, we know that's you behind them shades.
What you trying to do, hide?
Oh, I get it!
A little la cucaracha time.
Huh, Fred?
Uh, wait a minute, fellas.
Let me explain.
Ooh!
Fred's out with his Spanish teacher.
That's sweet!
Listen.
If you must know, uh we out here watchin' her daughter 'cause she's out with Lamont.
And we just watchin' 'em sitting over there.
- Oh, yeah?
Where?
- Right over there at the first ta I swear.
Honest.
There were sittin' right over there.
Sure they were!
Let's go, Skillet.
Let's led Fred and the señora enjoy their dinner.
Adiós, you two!
I'm dead now.
I'm ruined.
I'll never hear the end of this, and it's all your fault.
My fault?
Because of you, I didn't even see them leave.
You spoiled everything.
- Yes, sir.
Ready to order now?
- What?
- You ready to order dinner?
- I might as well since I'm here.
And waiter, uh, separate checks.
Hey, Pop, you home?
Hey, Pop, you up there?
Pop?
Hey, Pop, you in the kitchen?
You are home.
Didn't you hear me calling you?
Of course I'm home.
Where do you think I'd be with a fever like I got?
Are you gonna start that again?
I've been in bed ever since you left to see that girl.
I could've been dead.
Who is that at this time of night?
You expecting company?
- Hey, Leroy, Skillet - Hey, Lamont.
Hello, Fred.
- Good night, fellas.
- We just had to talk to your father.
Wait a minute.
All we want to know is who that woman was we saw you with tonight.
- What?
What'd you say?
- He didn't tell you?
Your pop was out with a real cutie!
And all the sisters in the neighborhood are gonna feel cheated.
Is there something that you'd like to tell us?
Yeah.
Basta.
All three of ya.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Hello, operator?
Listen, let me have the police.
Hello, police?
Listen, I was wondering if you have a report of an injured old man within the last hour or so?
Well, see, the old man happens to be Never mind.
Thank you.
Can I believe her When she tells me so Is she foolin' Is itjust a game You know, that's the way Sonny Til with the Oriels used to sing that.
Then they'd go, Am I the fire Orjust another flame I'll hit it one more time for you.
Am I the fire Orjust another flame Do you have any idea what time it is?
I didn't know what time it was until I met you You're full of songs tonight.
What else are you full of, muscatel?
No.
We were drinking muscatel and Ripple.
In fact, I call it, "muscatipple.
" And where have you been?
And don't tell me you've been sitting with no sick friend.
Well, if she was she's all right now.
- Whew!
- You was out with a woman?
Yes, I was out with a woman.
Who you think I'd be out with this time of night, Fats Domino?
And I just called the police to find out if they had any record of an injured old man.
All I really had to worry about was a dirty old man.
Don't say that.
She was a nice lady.
And where'd you meet this "nice lady"?
At a Swedish massage parlor?
Or did you answer one of them ads in the paper?
"Lonely young woman wants to meet silly old man?
Object: Rip-off.
" Don't talk like that about Mrs. Edwards.
She's a nice lady, and she's got class.
Mrs. Edwards might have class what you got to worry about is whether Mr. Edwards has a gun.
There ain't no Mr. Edwards.
She's divorced.
I don't want to talk about it.
I'm going to bed.
No, you don't.
You ain't going traipsing off to bed and have me sit down here worrying about you half the night.
Now what is this?
Is this something serious, or what?
This is serious.
I'm in love with her.
I think this is it.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
It's not something that just happens to young people, you know?
Old folks got feelings.
And old folks got plenty of feelings.
Just because a prune is wrinkled don't mean that it ain't tasty.
Well, who is this old prune anyway?
- I'm talking about me.
- Yeah, you're an old prune all right.
Well, she likes it.
In fact, she said I was the nicest guy she ever met in her whole life.
She must of had a hard life.
I don't want to talk about it if you're gonna make fun of the woman.
Okay, Pop.
All kidding aside, now.
Now what is this about?
What about Donna?
Aren't you engaged to the barracuda?
- Yes, I'm engaged to her.
So what?
- So what?
You gave her the engagement ring.
What about that?
- I'll ask her to give it back to me.
- What if she doesn't?
Well, then I'll tell her she's got to keep making the payments herself.
- Shut up.
- I don't understand this.
I don't, I don't.
You come in here You come in here singing.
I don't understand you.
And I don't understand this whole thing.
You might as well try to understand it.
It happens all the time.
What about when Elizabeth Taylor left Eddie Fisher for Richard Burton?
What about when Ingrid Bergman left her husband for that Italian fellow, Mussolini?
It was Rosselini.
And anyway, those people are in show business.
Well, the junk business is like show business.
If I got some junk I gotta show it, else I'm out the business.
- Then this whole thing is settled, huh?
- Just about.
She's coming tomorrow.
She might as well come and see what her future home looks like.
Remind me to spray the place real good.
Well, why?
Is she moving in here?
Not she, they.
She has two little children.
Mrs. Edwards is young enough to have little children?
What's her first name, Lolita?
Well, Jackie and Onassis did it.
So, just say that we're another Jackie and Onassis.
Living happily ever after on some Greek island.
The old prune and his young tomato living on figs.
Listen, you want to hear more about her or not?
If you don't, I can drink my beer upstairs.
Oh, no.
I wanna know all the sordid details.
Now, when did you meet her anyway?
I met her about a month ago in Ruby's Bar and Grill.
See, I was sitting at the bar on one end and she was sitting down at the other end.
And the bartender had just brought her one of them draft beers?
And she was licking the foam trying to catch it, you know before it got out on the counter.
And we looked up at the same time.
And it was as though no one else was in the whole room.
I can believe that.
She probably cleared the place lapping up beer on the bar.
Listen, I got acquainted with her and we found out that we were both lonely.
I thought you'd like the idea of me having some female companionship in my waning years.
- What's wrong with that?
- You wanna know what's wrong with it?
The smell of nail polish and cold cream all over the place.
The wash basin always full of stockings and stretch pants hanging all over the bathroom.
- You like that?
- I love it.
Yeah.
It's better than the smell of foot powder and your sweat socks hanging over the shower curtain.
And you say she's got little children?
That's worse than having a dog.
You gonna be stepping in peanut butter and jelly sandwiches all day.
You still don't understand, do you?
I said that I wouldn't even have told you 'cause I didn't even know if she was going to accept me.
- But she did.
- Yeah.
She accepted me.
I really thought that you'd like the idea of me having a female companion.
Because that way you wouldn't have to worry about me at night leaving me here by myself.
Ain't nothing wrong with having a female companion.
They very important.
You important, too, son.
But what I mean is, if you don't want me to you know, if you think it's a bad idea, then I'll give her up.
- What?
- Yeah.
I'll give her up.
I mean, you're my only son, but, I know I owe you something.
And I appreciate everything you've done.
But, I'll give her up if you say the word.
I love her, but I'll give her up for you if you don't want me to have her.
I'll quit her.
'Cause I love you too.
I love her, but I'll give her up.
I love her.
Look, Pop, I was only kidding.
If you want to get married to some young chick, you got my blessing.
- You really mean that?
- Sure.
- She's coming here tomorrow night?
- She's coming to meet you.
And then you know what I'm gonna do?
I think I'll take her somewhere nice for dinner.
All right.
Listen, don't worry about a thing.
I'm gonna be nice to her.
Now, you better go to bed, because it's getting late.
Yeah.
Okay, son.
And thanks an awful lot, hear?
That's all right.
Listen, Pop if she's got hairs on her chin, I'm not kissing her.
Why you always saying that kind of stuff?
Hello, young lovers Wherever you are I hope your troubles are few - What is that?
- It's a wig.
What it look like?
It looks like a big, black Brillo pad.
What are you wearing that ridiculous thing for anyway?
Because it covers the gray, and it makes me look younger.
But what about the gray on your chin?
You gonna shave that off, or dip it in Clairol?
If you gonna make a big deal out of it, I won't wear it.
Good.
What about the rest of me?
How do I look?
You look fine.
Let me straighten your tie.
There's no fiddlin' around here.
How about the house?
- The house look okay?
- The house looks fine.
Relax.
- And it smells all right?
- It smells great.
You need a drink.
Yeah, a drink.
That's always a good idea.
It's her.
It's Miss Edwards.
Would you relax, Pop?
You're gonna be dead before the honeymoon.
- Now, you be nice to her, son.
- Didn't I tell you I would?
Yeah, and I appreciate everything you've done for me.
Go let the woman in.
She's getting older by the minute.
And thank you, son.
And pour us some drinks.
Oh, good evening, Fred.
Good evening, uh, Judy, Miss Edwards.
Come in.
Uh, Judy, this is my son, Lamont.
Lamont, this is Miss Judy Edwards.
- How do you do, Lamont?
- Hi.
Hey, this is a celebration.
Pour the drinks there, son.
Let's celebrate.
Drinks?
Yeah, drinks.
What's wrong with you?
Where are your manners?
I'm sorry, Pop.
Pour the drinks here.
Say, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
That's my drink.
- You already had yours.
- Sorry, Pop.
Your drink.
Thank goodness.
What's the matter with you?
Oh, nothing.
It's just that, well, I was expecting somebody a little older.
Well, I told you she was young.
Oh, I'm not that young.
I'm 36.
Well, sit down, Judy.
Thirty-six?
That ain't that big a difference.
I read about bigger differences than that.
You know that artist, what his name, "Pistachio"?
Picasso.
Yeah.
Yeah, him.
I mean, he married a girl in her 20s and he damn near 100.
A hundred years old and he married a young girl.
I guess that's what surprised you.
Me having a pretty girl likeJudy.
Young thing.
You know what I mean?
You look lovely tonight, Judy.
Oh, thank you, Fred.
You look very handsome yourself.
- I do, don't I?
- Yes.
Is that a new suit?
Well, sort of.
See, Lamont picked it out for me after theJanuary white sale.
See, he got this at the February black sale.
- Guess I'll call on the phone.
- Huh?
I'm gonna make a phone call.
I'm calling a taxi to come.
You're taking a cab?
There are only two reasons why you take a cab.
That's on your engagement night, and if somebody's gonna have a baby and I ain't havin' no baby.
Listen, Pop, let me call the cab for you.
Oh, well, thanks, son.
And don't call no white cab company because as soon as you give 'em the address, they hang up in your face.
The phone.
It's dead.
There's no sound.
Listen, um, why don't you go next door and-and-and-and call from our neighbor's house and I can stay here and keepJudy company.
Yeah.
I don't know why that phone is dead.
I know I paid the bill.
It happens like that.
You stay here and get acquainted with Judy.
Introduce yourself to your future mother.
Yeah, she's pretty, isn't she?
Bye, Judy.
I'll be back.
- It's been a long time.
- Ten years.
Oh, Lamont.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know, but we better think of something fast, Mom.
I knew it was you the minute I turned around.
You haven't changed.
You look the same.
Well, neither have you, except for the mustache.
I started growing this right after we stopped seeing each other.
I had to do something.
It was like therapy.
When you met my father, didn't you know whose house he was coming to?
Well, no.
I made no connection between the two of you.
And besides, you didn't call yourself Lamont then, remember?
- What?
- No.
Your name was Jay Rupereaux.
What a mess.
If only I hadn't taken that dumb trip back to St. Louis with my old man.
Lamont, why didn't you write to me?
I did.
I wrote you every day.
- I didn't get not one letter from you.
- It was your mother.
She stole those letters.
She always hated me.
She didn't hate you.
She didn't think it was a good idea me marrying someone five years younger than me.
She said when I got to be 50, you'd be 45.
A man in the prime of his life, married to an old woman.
Yeah, well, I guess it's all right for you to marry an old man.
- Your father's only 59.
- 59?
That's what he told me.
He's 65, and he's always complaining about his heart.
Wait till he tries to slip the ring on your finger with his arthritis.
Judy, why didn't you wait for me?
When I didn't hear from you, I thought you had forgotten about me.
- So I started going with Stu Edwards.
- Stu Edwards?
You married him, "Stu the P-U"?
He was doing well.
He was a groom at Santa Anita racetrack.
I know.
That's why they called him the "P-U".
Did he sleep standing up like the rest of the horses?
Well, he did love the horses more than me.
A few years ago, we were divorced.
What are you gonna do now?
You can't marry my father now, Judy.
- Not now.
- Well, I can't back out now.
Why, I couldn't hurt him.
He's a kind, sweet man.
He's also an old man.
By the time you're ready for Social Security, he'll be 100.
Did you ever see a 100-year-old man sitting in a bathtub?
You're gonna have to hold on to him to keep him from getting sucked down the drain.
- What do you want me to do?
- But you can't love him.
- I don't.
But he knows it.
- What you doing it for?
So that when he dies, you'll inherit his estate?
Take a good look around you, Judy.
This is it.
When he dies, all of this is yours.
Lamont, it's been very difficult for me since my husband left.
And I get nothing from him.
In a few years, I'll be 40.
And a 40-year-old woman with children just doesn't get that many opportunities.
- All right, marry me.
- W-What?
What?
Well, why not?
I'm closer to your age than he is.
Oh, I couldn't.
But you could marry him and become my mother?
Listen, the first time you came upstairs to tuck me in he'd know something was wrong.
I had to call three cab companies before I finally got one.
One guy wanted me to put a deposit up for his hubcaps.
Say, how'd you two get along?
All right?
- Yeah, just swell, Pop.
- That's great, 'cause, you know that was worrying me, is whether you two would get along all right.
- But you like her, don't you, son?
- Yeah, she's wonderful.
You bet she's wonderful.
She is wonderful.
I guess I'm lucky too.
I got a good son, and I'm going to have me a nice, young wife.
What else do I need?
A dog, maybe.
But not really.
Listen, Pop.
There's something I want to say to you, see.
Yeah, there's something I wanted to do.
I was going to do it in the restaurant, but everything is going so nice I guess I'll do it now.
Here, Judy.
You like it?
I hope so.
Because, see, it's something I had in stock.
It's an antique ring.
And listen, Judy if your fingers start turning green, don't let that bother you It means you got too much calcium in your finger.
- You like it?
- It's beautiful.
Now, Fred You know what would really make this perfect?
If Lamont was getting married too.
What about it, son?
What about a double wedding?
We could get our picture in Gertrude Gibson's column.
Would you listen to me for a second?
Here's what I'm trying to say.
I know what you're gonna do.
You want to tell us what you're getting us for a wedding present.
Okay, son.
We're ready.
Shoot.
What you getting us?
Pop, this is probably the hardest thing that I've ever had to say to you.
- Pop, Judy and I - Lamont.
Lamont, not now.
I've got to tell him.
He's gotta know.
Pop, Judy and I are lovers.
But I wasn't gone but five minutes.
Not now.
This is something that happened a long time ago.
Just before we took that trip back to St. Louis.
I fell in love her, and I wanted to marry her then.
- Are you serious?
- It's true.
My mother was against it.
Yeah, she thought I was just another young punk looking for somebody older to support me.
Well, that part ain't changed.
Well, listen, Judy, didn't you know this was my son?
I mean, there ain't that many Sanfords around.
Yes, but I didn't know him as Sanford, he had another name then.
Who'd he tell you he was?
Super Fly?
- No.
Jay Rupereaux.
- Yeah, he look like one.
Anyway, Pop, we never saw each other again until tonight.
And I've got to be honest with you, nothing's changed.
I still love her.
And do you still love him?
Well, there it is.
That was a short engagement, wasn't it?
I'm sorry, Pop.
But, listen, I had to tell you.
I couldn't let you marry her without knowing.
- That wouldn't have been fair.
- Yeah, sure.
Listen, but we can all be one big, happy family.
It's just that she'll be married to me instead of you.
It'll be the same.
She'll just be in a different room, that's all.
No, I'll just move on out.
I'll go to a boarding house, get me a room.
See, I can come back here and do my coordinating and I'll sleep someplace else.
Absolutely not.
Now this is our house.
I belong here.
You belong here.
We both belong.
- Excuse me.
Fred, Lamont - Excuse me, Judy.
- This is family.
Don't get in this.
- It's family.
Family.
- Just stay out of this.
- Now, Pop.
We both been living in this house for over 30 years.
If you moved outta here, you wouldn't know how to live no place else.
And this house wouldn't be the same without you.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Right now, I'm getting me a hot toddy and going to bed.
- W-Wait just one minute now, Pop.
- Son The thing I want to impress upon you is this - Just give it a chance, Pop.
- It wouldn't work out, son.
Me being here in this house alone with your wife, coordinating.
It's all my fault.
I never should have said nothing.
I should have been the one to leave.
I should have left and then come back one day, looked in the window and seen how happy the two of y'all was, like in the movie Stella Dallas.
That wouldn't work either.
'Cause as soon as she called me Lamont orJay Rupereaux, I'd know something was wrong.
- I'll just move out.
- I can't let you do that, Pop.
But we gotta do something.
I know.
I'm gonna go out there and tell her she's gotta go through with the original plans.
Wait a minute.
Don't tell her that.
Hey, here's a note and the ring you gave her.
What's the note say?
Says she doesn't want to see us split up on account of her.
That she doesn't want to come between us because it won't work out because we're already married.
- What does she mean by that?
- I don't know.
I better cancel this cab.
- Say, the phone's working again.
- Huh?
Oh, good.
It's too late, Pop.
Cab's here.
Listen, I got two reservations for a Chinese restaurant.
- What should we do?
Shall we go?
- Why not?
Ain't no reason to sit around here moping.
Hey, we'll be right out!
Hey, Pop, what do you think she meant by this "because we're already married"?
- It beats me, son.
- Well, you ready to go?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Look at your tie.
Stop fooling around, will you?
- Have you got the keys?
Come on.
- I got the keys.
- Wait a minute.
Let me get my glasses.
- What do you need glasses for?
We're going to a restaurant to eat.
We're going to a Chinese restaurant, ain't we?
I want to be able to see if any of that Chinese food is moving on the plate.
Why do I always have to wait for you?
Every time we go someplace, I have to be the one to wait for you.
I'm always waitin' for you.
That was some good dinner, wasn't it, Pop?
- You betcha.
- That chow mein was terrific.
- Yeah, it was really good.
- Yeah.
I wish them waiters though wouldn't say, "flied lice.
" Anyway, that dinner helped you to forget aboutJudy, didn't it?
About who?
See how quick I forgotJudy?
I bet it would have been different if you had gone to dinner with her.
Yeah, it would.
I'd of had to leave a tip.
Yeah, and right after dinner Right after dinner she would have started putting on her makeup right there at the table.
They always get lipstick on their teeth and on the glass where they drink on.
You know what else they do?
They hold a napkin up in front of their mouth so they don't think people know what they're doing with that other hand.
And they'll be picking their teeth like this.
Uh-huh.
And you know what else gets to me?
When they say they gotta go to the powder room to put on a new face.
And come back 15 minutes later looking the same way.
Hey, Pop, if women got all these bad qualities how come you chase after them like you do?
You know what the bible says, that woman was made from a rib.
I can live without a lot of things, but I can't live without ribs.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Jerry West is dribbling down the court, he looks for the big man, Chamberlain.
He passes to Chamberlain.
Chamberlain gives it to Hap Hairston.
Hap fakes!
Yeah.
Okay, you think you're pretty good, huh?
I don't like to brag, Julio, but basketball is my people's game.
Your people's game?
What are you talkin' about?
All the great basketball players, they black.
That's 'cause they've got style, and flair.
And they cool.
- Some Puerto Ricans are pretty cool too.
- Who?
Who?
You never heard of Orlando Cepada?
Hey, man, he's a baseball player.
I know that, man!
But it's harder!
It's a smaller ball.
That's right!
Hey, you guys!
Hey!
Cut out the ball playing, will you, before you break something?
Didn't you guys hear me say cut out the ball playing?
I'm sorry you put that ol' dumb hoop up anyway.
Man, what are we hurting?
You're raising up dust.
It's settlin' on my junk and giving it that cheap look.
Are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious.
Hey, listen, why don't you go do some work, "Holio"?
The name is Julio, Mr. "Stanford.
" - It's Sanford, Julio.
- Okay, then.
Why don't you do some work in your yard?
Clean your yard up.
Go take a bath.
Go milk your goat.
I did all that this morning.
Why don't you go back to Puerto Rico?
Here we go again.
I'm gonna tell you for the last time.
I come from New York City.
And I can live in any one of the 50 states that I want.
Why don't you try Alaska?
That's a state.
Julio is our neighbor, and he's here to stay.
Why don't you accept that?
'Cause I have arthritis and I'm hoping that will go away too.
I'm sorry, Julio.
I gotta apologize for my father.
You don't have to.
I think I'm beginning to understand your father.
He is one of those people that always likes to complain.
"I kill a Puerto Rican.
I kill basketball.
" Everything gives him a pain.
No, not everything.
Just you.
I'll tell you where.
- Man, it's okay.
- Here comes that killer again!
Hold that killer!
That's another thing.
Why don't you keep your goat in your own backyard?
I'm sorry, Mr. Sanford.
He gets loose.
He does it all the time.
But I don't want him to do it in my yard.
I'll see you later.
So long, Mr. Sanford.
And by the way, you do not fool me, you know?
Outside you might be rough and mean.
But I know what is inside.
You know what's inside?
A baseball bat.
You wanna see it?
A baseball It's a good thing thatJulio is such a good-natured cat.
I still don't know why he puts up with your insults.
Why you hang out with him anyway for?
Soon you be talking funny like him.
Sometimes you really sound like a weirdo.
There you go already.
Weirdo that's Spanish.
Why don't you hang out with your other friends?
You got friends.
- Like who?
- Like Rollo.
Rollo?
You hate Rollo.
- I don't hate Rollo.
I can't stand him.
- What's the difference?
The difference is, if you can't stand somebody, you don't wanna touch him.
But if you hate somebody, you wanna touch him.
And Julio is somebody you'd like to touch?
Continuously with some of these.
Pop, I don't know what you got againstJulio.
He's good people, and he happens to be a friend of mine.
- You got other friends.
- Who besides Rollo that you can stand?
Me.
I'm your friend.
- You're my father.
- Right.
Now, listen.
Move over.
See, some of the best friendships ever been in the world been between father and son.
You remember that movie, The Champ, with Wallace Beery and Jackie Cooper?
- That was a great friendship.
- Okay, Pop, you're my friend.
But it's not the same thing.
What can we do together?
We can do a lot of things together.
We can play cards and checkers, watch television and work crossword puzzles.
Man, those are all things that old men do.
I ain't no old man.
I go out with chicks.
Get me a chick.
I'll go out with you.
Forget it.
Listen, son.
There are a lot of things that we can do together.
Outdoor stuff like going fishing.
- Fishing?
- Yeah, fishing.
You wake up early in the morning and fix you some bologna sandwiches.
You know, with mayonnaise and onion.
And coleslaw.
And get you a couple of six-packs.
Go to the Santa Monica pier and catch one of them boats and go out there all day and just fish and drink and burp.
Ain't nothing like burping in the cool sea breeze.
Yeah, it sounds terrific.
When you come home with all that fish you caught, then you cornmeal 'em down.
Then you fry 'em and open up a couple cans of pork and beans.
Boy, you rest good that night.
Don't tell me that don't sound good.
It does.
It sounds very good.
Why don't we do it sometime?
What about this weekend?
- How 'bout what?
- This weekend.
I'd love to, Pop, but me and Julio already made plans.
- What plans?
- We goin' to Tijuana together.
- Going where?
- Tijuana.
You know, Mexico.
Going with a Spanish-speaking person, I'm really gonna get around.
Yeah, you gonna get around.
Especially if you drink the water.
Pop, we made these plans a long time ago.
Yeah, I know.
See, you won't go fishing with your father but you'll go to a foreign country with a Puerto Rican and end up on a blind date with Typhoid Mary.
I sure hope that's Julio.
I don't wanna hear this no more.
- Julio!
- Lamont.
You ready, man?
Y'all going already?
No.
Julio's taking me to a Mexican restaurant for dinner.
A restaurant?
You going out to eat?
I got dinner fixed.
Hey, Pop, I'm sorry.
But save it.
We'll eat it tomorrow.
I gotta eat dinner by myself?
Wait.
Why don't you come with us?
- Me, go to a Mexican restaurant?
- Why not?
You don't wanna eat alone.
People who eat alone have trouble with digestion.
That's what they say about people who eat in Mexican restaurants.
- You don't have to go.
You can stay.
- No.
Wait, Lamont!
How 'bout it?
What do you say?
Well, okay.
I'll try anything once.
Wait till I get my sweater.
That's great.
What'd you do that for?
He's gonna be trouble.
No, he's not gonna be trouble.
He's gonna be fine.
Besides, it's a good way for us to become friends.
- You ready, Mr. Sanford?
- Soon as I get a bottle of something.
Wait a second.
You don't have to worry.
They got wine at the restaurant.
I'm not speaking about wine.
Pepto-Bismol.
Come on.
This thing is in Spanish.
I know that.
I will translate for you.
First, soup is sopa.
Oh, soup is sopa.
Let's have a bowl of Irish sopa.
You get that?
Irish sopa We got it.
We got it, Pop.
Señores, do you know what you want?
I want neck bones and black-eyed peas canned sweet potatoes and mustard greens.
What's the matter with you?
You know they don't have that here.
He asked me what I wanted and I said what I wanted and that's what I want.
Neck bones, black-eyed peas.
- All right!
- Canned sweet potatoes - Why don't you let me order for us?
- And corn bread.
- We'll start with a little seviche.
- Seviche?
- Sí.
- What's that?
Pickled raw fish.
- Bye.
- Would you sit down.
Take this hat off.
For you I think I will order something nice and mild.
Some chiles rellenos con queso.
I know I'm gonna have a "queso" after I eat that.
Pop, you don't have to eat in here.
You can get up and leave.
And we will have the arroz con pollo.
Waiter?
Come here.
When was the last time the health department's been here?
- Excuse me?
- Nothing, waiter.
Thank you very much.
- You better cut it out.
- You have nothing to worry about.
This place is very clean and the food is excellent.
I have had everything here.
- Have you had hepatitis?
- I'm leaving.
No.
Wait, Lamont, please.
Please, sit down.
Here you are, gentlemen.
A nice cold pitcher of sangria.
What'd you call him?
It's a very common thing.
You know.
What?
I call him negro.
It's a common thing.
It's a friendly way of talking to each other in Spanish.
- What we call ourselves.
- He look like no Negro to me.
Mr. Sanford, you are going to enjoy this.
It is called sangria.
Sangria.
- What does "sangria" mean?
- It means "blood.
" It is only a name.
Because of the color.
Oh.
I thought it was something they brought back from the bullfight.
No, no.
It's a very popular drink.
Do you like it?
Yeah, it tastes good.
Tastes like Ripple that's gone flat.
In fact, they should call it "Flapple.
" - What's that stuff at the bottom?
- That is fruit.
Look like garbage.
That's it.
You can stay here and eat with him, but I'm leaving.
No, please, don't be Excuse me, Mr. Sanford.
Lamont, please come back.
Pardon me, please.
Hey, Negro, come here.
Bring me another pitcher of that Shangri-la.
And, waiter, hold the garbage.
Hey, Pop, I'm leaving.
You in the kitchen?
What is that?
It's a wheelchair.
What it look like, a Toyota?
I know it's a wheelchair, but what you doin' in it?
I woke up this morning with a heart attack.
You woke up with one?
It wouldn't happen to have anything to do with the fact thatJulio and I are goin' to Tijuana, would it?
- Maybe.
- This whole thing is just a charade.
- A what?
- A charade.
Is that what they dress dead people in?
That's shroud.
Shroud.
Charade.
I won't be around much longer to bother you.
That's right.
Go on.
Have fun in tamale land.
If I'm not here when you get back, get in touch with me through your mother.
- Would you stop this?
- That's right.
That's probably where I'll be, in that great ghetto in the sky.
Before you leave, turn on channel 13 'cause I wanna go watching the Roller Derby.
- I'll see you later.
- Wait a minute.
- Now what?
- You and Julio the only ones going?
- That's right.
- Well, come here.
- What?
- Come here.
Sit down.
You know, I'm very worried aboutJulio.
Why?
You don't know why?
What is Julio anyway?
He's a Puerto Rican.
Is that what's bothering you?
No, that ain't it.
I'm talking about Have you ever seen him out with a girl?
- I knew it was something like that.
- You think about it.
- What are you trying to say?
- Nothing.
JustJulio might be Aside from the fact that you woke up this morning with a heart attack and you think thatJulio might be is there any other reason why I shouldn't leave now?
No, go ahead.
Don't even think about me.
- I won't.
I'll see you later.
- Hey, Lamont.
- You got your key?
- Of course I've got my key.
That's good.
'Cause just in case I'll be too sick to come open the door.
Good morning.
I'm Nelson B. Davis of the Davis Funeral Home.
- You are?
What you doin' here?
- I received a call from Fred Sanford.
Yeah, I'm Fred Sanford.
I'm the one that called you.
Come right in.
- It's good to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.
Sorry about those cold hands.
Cold hands, warm chapel.
That's a little joke in the profession.
Would somebody tell me what's going on and what this dude's doing here?
I didn't know you was gonna be here.
Me and Mr. Davis are gonna talk over some burial insurance.
Burial insurance?
Who's gettin' buried?
All of us eventually.
Is that supposed to be a joke?
That ain't no joke.
Don't let us hold you up.
Go on your trip.
We don't wanna slow you down.
Mr. Davis and I are gonna talk about burial insurance.
You're doing a very wise thing, planning ahead for the inevitable.
Because when that inevitable day comes, there are so many things to do.
Calls to make, arrangements.
And if it should happen over a holiday weekend, it really can be a problem.
We take care of everything: The services, the flowers, the plot, even the monument.
See, when I die, I won't have to do nothing.
Yeah, but what's to hurry for?
Why does he need all this now?
There is no time like the present.
Our slogan is, "Buy now, pray later.
" Would you come back some other time?
I know why my father wanted you here.
- Wait.
It might be too late then.
- Are you going away?
Just for the weekend.
He will last the weekend, won't he?
We'll just keep our fingers crossed.
I shall wait to hear from you.
Here is my card.
Please call me.
And, young man, don't consider what your father is doing as unusual.
You know, burial insurance is something that everybody digs.
I heard that one at a morticians' cocktail party.
Good day, Mr. Sanford.
Mr. Sanford.
I'm leaving unless you can think of another reason why I should stay.
Go.
Who's holding you?
I'll just sit here and watch television.
Might as well be dead.
No wife, no son, no nothing.
You wanna watch Wild Kingdom with me?
That was a good lunch.
Really enjoyed that.
Huh?
Oh, yeah, it was a good lunch.
In another 30 or 40 minutes we'll be in Tijuana.
- What did you say?
- Thirty or forty minutes, and Tijuana.
- Oh, right, yeah.
- Wait.
You sure you wanna keep going?
- What are you talking about?
- You ain't said two words since we left.
I've been doing all the talking.
You're worried about your father.
- I am not.
- Yes, you are, man.
I know you hate to leave him alone.
You're worried something will happen.
I am not.
What could happen to him?
He's an old man, and he's got things wrong with him.
That stuff about him being sick?
That's a fake to keep me in the house with him.
Sure, to keep you there.
Because he loves you.
You're the only thing he's got.
Oh, man, I wish my father was still living.
It's funny, you know, because you think they're gonna go on living forever.
Then all of a sudden, they're gone.
Then you're sorry you didn't spend more time with them.
I don't even wanna talk about this.
Come on.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
It's very simple, man.
You only got one father, right?
And when he's gone I mean, that's it.
I'll bet he wishes you and him could be spending more time together right now.
Yeah, 'cause he wanted me to go fishing with him.
Fishing?
Oh, man.
I wish I could go fishing with my father.
It's too late now.
And that faking you was talking about Who knows, man?
Who can tell sometimes when they're faking or not?
Let's get outta here.
Want me to drive?
Yeah, but wait a minute.
You don't know how long he's been fooling me.
- My old man's been fooling me for years.
- Okay, so he fools you 99 times.
But what about the hundredth time?
Maybe, psst.
Yeah, but wait a minute.
All them phony heart attacks he has, they don't mean nothing.
Every time I wanna go someplace or do something he has one of them phony heart attacks.
Okay.
Well, let's just hope this time it's not the real thing.
- Now are you ready to go?
- Where?
- Where?
Tijuana!
- Tijuana, are you crazy?
My father could be at home dying, and we talking about goin' to Tijuana.
- I'm going home.
- Hey, wait for me.
- Guess you feel better now you're home.
- I feel a lot better.
I never would've been able to enjoy Tijuana, worrying about my father.
Sure, man.
Besides, we can go to Tijuana any time.
- Maybe next weekend, huh?
- That's a good idea, man.
Hey, Pop, I'm home!
You upstairs?
Hey, Pop, you in the kitchen?
He's not here.
I wonder what happened to him.
- I don't know.
Maybe he went for a walk.
- He hates walking.
- Look at this wheelchair.
- What about it?
It looks like somebody fell down and crawled outside here and out into the street and collapsed.
That's what happened.
He collapsed out here, and somebody called the ambulance.
That's it!
He's in the hospital!
You gonna enjoy my place, honey.
Yes, indeed.
I'm not kidding you.
You'll like my place because it's nice and cozy.
And I want you to try some of this Shanghai because it's really good.
It tastes like Ripple that's gone flat.
That's why I call it Flapple.
Hey, the truck.
My son was supposed to be outta town, but he must be back.
You gotta leave.
I didn't know my son was coming back.
You gonna have to leave.
What kind of jive nonsense is this?
You invite me over, now you brush me off?
Shh.
I don't want him to hear you.
I don't care if he does hear me!
You can't do this to me!
Listen.
You got to go.
I'll bring you back here some other time.
I ain't ever coming back here again, you jive chump.
You got me off of that bar when the other dude was buying me four drinks.
Now I've got to go and start over again.
I'll take you back and I'll buy You back home early, ain't you, son?
Do you know what I thought?
I thought you fell down, crawled out here and collapsed.
And that's exactly what happened.
My heart was hurting so bad, I crawled out here.
Then I crawled into the street and collapsed.
This lady here was nice enough to pick me up and help me home.
Who picked you up?
You picked me up!
Don't you never come 'round me, you raggedy old bum!
I should've known better than to be wasting my time with a jive, stupid old buzzard like you!
If you didn't have a heart attack, she'd have gave you one.
I think I'm having one now, son.
Oh!
This is the big one!
You hear that, Elizabeth?
I'm coming to join you, honey with a fifth of Flapple in my hand.
Well, not quite a fifth, honey.
What you want Baby, I got it - What's happening, Jul?
- Hey, Lamont.
You ready to go, man?
- As soon as I get my stuff.
- Good.
Where's your father?
He's upstairs sulking.
I told me and you was going fishing and he wasn't invited.
He's mad.
I'll get my stuff.
- Want me to get it?
- Nah.
Good morning.
Is your father home?
Oh, I see.
Just a minute, Mr. Davis.
Hey, Pop, Mr. Davis is down here to see you.
He'll be right down.
How come you're back so soon?
He called me.
He said he wanted to discuss burial insurance.
He said you wouldn't be here, and we could talk.
Hello, son.
I thought you'd be gone by now.
Me and Mr. Davis wanna discuss burial insurance.
Burial insurance?
On such a nice day?
Mr. Sanford, you should be out fishing instead.
I'd love to go fishing.
Why don't you come with us?
Ask him, man.
Ask him, man.
Remember what I told you.
If we take you fishing, would you promise to forget this burial insurance?
- I sure would.
- Get your stuff.
We'll wait for you.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
- Let me help you out, Pop.
- Never mind.
I'll do it myself.
Why did we go on that long ride?
That sure was dumb.
Yeah, but I thought you'd enjoy a nice ride on a Sunday afternoon at the beach.
How about the air out there?
It stunk.
- What are you talking about?
- Seaweed, garbage and dead fish.
Yeah, but what about the ocean view?
I saw what I smelled.
Garbage, seaweed and dead fish.
Let me get the door for you, Pop.
I bet we missed a good movie on television fooling around.
They show good movies on Sunday afternoons.
Let me see here.
I knew it.
See what we missed?
Dagora, the Space Monster, with Yosuke Natsuki and Yoki Fujiyama.
- Who are they?
- They'reJapanese actors.
What did you think they were, a couple of motorcycles?
I bet it was a good one too.
Look at this.
"Creatures from outer space start a wave of international jewel robberies.
" You know, I think that was the one where the monster eats all the Tiffany stores.
- And we missed it.
- I'm sorry, Pop.
Make yourself comfortable.
Take off your shoes, and I'll bring you some slippers.
And I'll go get you a drink.
Listen, you don't have to be nice to me.
You already ruined my Sunday afternoon with that long ride in that pickup truck with no shock absorbers.
I don't need no slippers.
For where you give me a pain I need a rubber seat cushion.
Here you go, Pop.
Have a beer and I'm gonna tell you why I took you out to the beach.
You remember all those nice homes that we passed that looked like rich, private homes?
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, they're not.
Just take a look at these, Pop.
"The Garden of Eden Retirement Hotel.
" "The Silver Swan for Senior Citizens.
" "The Pink Panther Patio Home for the Aged.
" Say, these are old folks' homes.
I ain't interested in nothing like that.
Yeah, but there's a lot of people your age living in 'em, Pop.
They can be fun places to live in.
Yeah, a lot of fun.
Curtis Hicks's father was in one, and he told me just what they're like.
What did he tell you?
He said that when they lock you up at night if you bang on the door and try to escape they send a 300-pound nurse around there to sit on you until you're unconscious.
Pop, that's just a bunch of nonsense.
And he said the food was so bad the oatmeal was so runny he had to suck it through a straw.
And the stealing.
The stealing that goes on.
It's horrible.
He said that one night a guy sneaks into his room and stole his false teeth out of the glass.
And the next morning, he met him in the hall and he smiled at him with his own teeth.
Pop, those are just a bunch of ridiculous stories.
Well, listen, why are you interested in those places for anyway?
Well, I've given this a lot of thought, Pop and I'm really thinking about you.
This is the hardest decision that I ever had to make.
Pop, I want you to go into one of them homes.
What?
Me?
Yeah.
See, I'm gonna be going away soon - Going away?
- And I can't leave you here alone.
Going away where?
Well, now, I thought about this for a long time and I'm gonna feel a lot better if I know you're in a place where they're gonna take real good care of you.
Never mind the speech.
Where are you going?
I'm going around the world on a tramp steamer.
Going where?
I'm going around the world on a tramp steamer.
- I never heard nothing so funny in my - What's so funny?
You going around the world in a tramp steamer.
Listen, I remember one time I rented a boat for an hour and had to come back in 15 minutes because you was barfing.
Pop, I was just a little kid then, full of cotton candy and soda pop.
Listen, where you get this idea to go around the world with a tramp?
A tramp steamer.
See, I read this ad in a magazine, Pop and I started thinking to myself, I'm not getting any younger.
One of these days I'll be an old man, and what have I done, where have I been?
You've been to Disneyland.
I'm talking about travel, adventure, Pop.
I want to visit jungles, deserts, mountaintops.
Well, they got that at Disneyland.
See, you just ain't been on all the rides.
Now, I'm serious about this, and you're joking.
Pop, I want to hear strange languages and see some strange people.
You want to see some strange people?
Then go to St. Louis and look up your mother's people.
Do you want to hear about this or don't you?
I don't care if I hear about it or not.
Don't be bothering me.
See, Pop, the ad said that you can work your way, and it takes about a year.
Now, listen to some of this stuff that you can do.
It says, "You can be stretched out on some tropical beach eating exotic fruits.
You can be pearl fishing in a coral sea.
Ivory transporting up the coast of Africa.
Whale hunting off Antarctica.
" Shipwrecked off Catalina.
That's just about as far as you'd get.
Say, how many of you all are going on this trip?
Well, the ad said there'd be a crew of about 20.
- All men?
- Naturally, Pop.
This is a real challenge, a risk.
This is what separates the men from the boys.
You just make sure that you know how to separate the men from the fruitcakes.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you might go on this trip and come back with an earring in one ear and walking funny.
Pop, this is a bunch of men on a ship working together.
Well, just don't be surprised one night while you're on the high seas if the first mate says "Would you swab the deck, honey"?
I knew you'd put it down, but it won't change my mind, 'cause I'm gonna do it.
I don't want to talk about it.
I'm going to my room.
Wait a minute, Pop.
I was going to take you out to Sunday dinner.
I'm not hungry.
See, now I know why you're so nice to me.
"Let me get your slippers, Pop.
" "Let me open the door for you, Pop.
" Well, I don't want to wish you no bad luck but I hope your ship sinks.
With no lifeboats.
And no life preservers.
And a school of piranhas surrounding you and closing in.
You big dummy.
- Sit over here, Pop.
- Don't touch me.
Hey, this is a nice place, isn't it, Pop?
Look at this.
"This week's entertainment Monday night, bingo.
Tuesday night Dr. Tolbert will lecture on the cause and cure of constipation.
" Wednesday morning, bingo.
You know, Pop, I think you're really gonna like it here.
We were lucky to get in this place.
I hope the sharks get you.
Now, you said you were gonna go through with this, Pop.
Don't start nothing now, please.
I'll start something.
I'll let everybody know what kind of son I got.
My son is going around the world with a bunch of fruitcakes!
Don't shush me.
You got me here.
That's what you wanted, ain't it?
Well, go on back to your dumb ship.
Just go on back and leave me alone.
Listen, Pop.
You might even learn to like this place Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I'm Miss Ecker.
And you're Mr Sanford.
This is my father, Fred Sanford.
We talked on the phone earlier.
Oh, yes.
Well, welcome aboard, Mr. Sanford.
Just what this place needs new blood.
You know, we're fully integrated here.
I know you're fully something.
And what have we in our bag?
I don't know what we have in our bag but I know what I got in my bag.
I mean, is it full of clothes and miscellaneous?
No, it's full of wine bottles and a corkscrew.
Didn't my son tell you?
I'm a wino.
Well, Pop's always kidding.
He's a great kidder.
I'm not kidding.
I'm a troublemaker.
And I want everybody to know it.
Don't stop me.
And listen.
If I don't get everything I want here, I'll go on a hunger strike.
Mr. Sanford, I'm sure you'll get everything you want.
We have a marvelous program here recreational as well as occupational.
Do you like leathercraft?
You know, you could make your son a wallet.
My son don't want no wallet.
When he comes back off this trip, he gonna want a purse.
I beg your pardon?
Nothing.
See, he's going on an around-the-world tour with a bunch of fruitcakes.
So say bon voyage to the African queen.
Listen, don't pay any attention to my father, Miss Ecker.
He's always making funnies.
Right, Pop?
I wouldn't worry about him, Mr. Sanford.
They're always a little upset at first.
We'll take care of him.
He'll be in good hands.
Oh, why don't I show you to your room, Mr. Sanford?
All right?
- Anything you say.
Miss Okra.
- Ecker.
Ecker.
I have this nice room right across the hall from me.
Won't that be cozy?
Just don't start no funny stuff.
See, you might be fully integrated, but I ain't crossed that bridge yet.
Right this way, Mr. Sanford.
Oh, Mr. Malloy, I'd like you to meet our newest senior citizen, Mr. Sanford.
Hi.
How would you like a nice game of shuffleboard?
How would you like one across your lips?
- Maybe later, Mr. Malloy.
- Eh?
Maybe later.
How much later?
I'm 89 years old.
We're going to get settled first, Mr. Malloy.
We'll see you later.
In here, Mr. Sanford.
I'd knock him out.
He might have had a reach on me but I'd have ducked under that, and then I'd - Hey, old timer.
What's happening?
- What do you mean, "old timer"?
I'm having a fit, that's what's happening.
You want me to fit this upside your nose?
- Would you like to try it?
- Yeah, I'll try it.
Come on in.
- All right.
- Go ahead, mister.
Go ahead, mister.
I'll hurt him!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on!
Pop, why are you starting a fight with everybody for?
Don't say nothing to me.
I'll give you one of these for a good-bye present.
Don't touch me.
Hey, Pop, look at this room!
This is great, isn't it?
This is better than the one at home.
Oh, I know you'll enjoy it, Mr. Sanford.
The man who was here before found it very pleasant.
God rest his soul.
Well, I'll leave you two to say good-bye to each other.
Lunch is at 1:00 sharp, Mr. Sanford.
Guess what we're having today?
Spaghetti and codfish cakes!
Yummy!
- Well, let me help you unpack.
- Don't touch my bag.
I'll do it myself.
Well, I guess I'll be going.
Hey, Pop, listen.
I'll write you at least once a week.
And you know what you can do?
Save the stamps, start a stamp collection.
Whoopie.
Well, I guess I'll be going.
Hey, Pop, you do understand, don't you?
I mean, this is something that I got to do.
But listen, I'm not gonna leave until I get everything settled with the house.
So that means I'll be coming back to see you.
So long, Pop.
Bye, Pop.
Well, Elizabeth we're all alone now, just me and you.
Whatever it is, I don't want none of it!
I don't want to play no shuffleboard, I don't want to play no checkers and I don't want to weave no damn baskets.
Will you go away?
I'm smoking pot.
Hey, Fred, it's me.
- Bubba!
- Hey, Fred!
Bubba!
I'm glad to see you, Bubba!
Oh, it's good to see you, too, Fred.
- What you got there?
- I brought you something.
- What is it?
- Some food from the ghetto.
I stopped off at Leo's Barbecue and brought you some ribs.
Oh, Bubba, I could cry.
But first I'm gonna eat these ribs.
Sit down.
- Boy, this smells good, Bubba.
- Is the food bad here, Fred?
Is it bad?
It ain't got no taste.
It's like eating a handkerchief.
You know what I mean?
You could have a meal here and then belch and it wouldn't remind you of nothing.
That bad, huh?
Oh, it's bad, Bubba.
What are you looking at, that picture?
Isn't that something?
I'm spending my last days on earth here and they got a picture of an Indian.
Least they could do is give me a picture ofJesus.
I can bring you one, Fred.
I got one at home where the eyes follow you around the room.
No, I don't want that, Bubba.
Hi.
How's about a game of horseshoes?
No, we don't want to play no horseshoes.
I got a visitor here.
How about you?
You want to play some horseshoes?
No, thanks.
Nobody wants to play horseshoes anymore.
What's happening to America?
- Who's that?
- Some guy who wanted to play horseshoes.
I think he's got one more game of horseshoes left in him and I don't want to be around when he plays it.
- Who is it?
- It's me, Mr. Sanford.
Miss Ecker.
I wondered if you'd like to come down to the recreation room and hear a lecture by Dr. Tolbert.
The subject today is "You and your pancreas.
" No, I don't think so.
Well, it's going to be an illustrated lecture with movies.
Wouldn't you like to see how your pancreas breaks down all your carbohydrates?
No, I don't like them movies with all that violence in it.
Well, I'll see you later.
See that, Bubba?
It's like that all day long.
They just run you ragged.
I've been here a couple of days and I've worn out two pair of shoes already.
Man, I sure wish you were back home, Fred.
I do too, Bubba.
But this is the way Lamont wanted it.
- Say, did the dummy leave yet?
- Not yet.
- You think he'll really go?
- He said he's going.
Because I want to tell you, he really misses you already.
- Really?
- Yeah.
He told me he never thought he'd miss you this much.
- Good.
- I'll tell you what else he told me.
He told me it's strange being in that house alone.
He said he seems to hear your voice all the time.
And he's gonna hear my voice the rest of his life saying just one word over and over dummy, dummy, dummy.
Well, guess I'll be going, Fred.
Say, look here, Bubba.
Is it true swear to God, Bubba that he said that he hears my voice all the time?
- That's right.
- You got your car with you?
- Yeah.
Why?
- I want you to drop me off somewhere and I'll tell you about it on the way.
- Okay, Fred.
- Hey, wait a minute.
I better take these with me, 'cause Dr. Tolbert might give a lecture on "me and my ribs.
" - Oh, hi, Bubba.
- Hey, Lamont.
Say, is that what you're gonna wear on your trip around the world?
- Yeah, Bubba.
It's a pea coat.
- Yeah?
Did you know that when you bought it?
That's what it's called, Bubba.
It's a navy pea coat.
House sure seems empty since your pop's been gone.
- Yeah, it does, doesn't it, Bubba?
- Look at that.
He must have forgot to take his hat.
Hey, you know what, Bubba?
I gave Pop this hat for his 65th birthday.
Look at that.
You see them initials?
F.S. Fred Sanford.
You know what he told me those initials stood for?
Fine son.
- He told you that?
- Yeah.
You know what else he told me?
He told me he understood why you had to go away.
Just as long as you always remember what he looks like and how he sounds.
By the way, do you still seem to be hearing his voice here in the house?
Yeah, Bubba, and it's really weird.
Lamont!
Lamont!
Did you hear that, Bubba?
Hear what?
Pop's voice.
It wasn't my imagination.
I really heard it that time.
I didn't hear nothing.
I swear I heard it, Bubba.
Don't go, Lamont!
Now, don't tell me you didn't hear it that time, Bubba.
You know what I think?
That sounded like it came from upstairs.
I think Pop's in this house somewhere.
Don't go, son!
Don't go!
- It sounds like it came from down here!
- Take it easy, Lamont.
Here.
Sit down and relax.
I'll take a look outside.
You just sit.
Well, ain't nothing out there.
You know what I think, Lamont?
I think it's because you two spent all those years in this house together.
I bet when you get out on that ocean, you won't hear it no more.
- Don't you think so?
- I don't know, Bubba.
I don't know.
Well, in case I don't see you, have a good trip.
Oh.
Yeah, thanks, Bubba.
Thanks a lot.
- Okay.
So long, Lamont.
- So long, Bubba.
- Did the dummy go for it?
- Yeah!
Dummy!
Dummy!
I'm certainly sorry to see you go, Mr. Sanford.
But I'm glad you're going home.
What made you change your mind about taking that trip, young man?
Well, a little voice came to me and said now wasn't the time to do it.
I'm sorry you won't be here for the lecture this afternoon.
It'll be good.
What's it about?
"You and your gall bladder"?
Oh, no.
Dr. Tolbert's subject for today is "Do we expect too much from our children"?
Oh, I don't have to worry about that.
Because my kid gives me everything I expect.
- Right, son?
- Right, Pop.
Isn't that nice?
Well, good-bye, Mr. Sanford, and good luck.
- Good-bye.
- Yeah, good-bye, Miss Okra.
- Ecker.
- Yeah.
Oh, I forgot my suitcase.
Come on, Elizabeth.
Let's get the hell out of here.
- See you Sunday night, Pop.
- What are you talking about?
- Where are you going?
- Didn't I tell you?
Rollo and I is taking the pickup truck, and we're gonna drive to San Diego.
You mean you're gonna leave me here all alone?
Listen, you said I couldn't go around the world, but I can go to San Diego.
- Listen, son - I'll see you, Pop.
Don't leave me here by myself.
Say, you don't mind if Lamont goes to San Diego, do you?
I mean, that's not like leaving you and going around the world.
No, but every now and then, I got to tell him a few things before he just takes on off and leaves.
It's like psychology.
Oh, is that how you keep Lamont at home?
With psychology?
Well, that and the keys to the truck.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hey, what's the matter with you?
Can't you drive yet?
You almost wrecked my washing machine.
Get them plants there and bring 'em in the house.
Hey, Pop, where'd you get these plants?
I bought 'em off a guy who was goin' out of business.
- You like 'em?
- Not particularly.
See, now people can't say, "Sanford and Son ain't got a pot.
" 'Cause now we got two of'em.
Don't tell me you're going into the flower-raising business because the only thing that'll grow around here is poison ivy.
See?
That show you how much you know.
Go ahead.
Touch that plant.
Why, is it poison ivy?
No, dummy, it's plastic.
The guy that sold it to me said that it'd pick up the smell of whatever's around.
If it picks up the smell of this place, it's gonna be some flower.
Well, I'm gonna keep 'em in the kitchen.
See, I think you'd rather have a flower that smelled like a pork chop than a chrysan chrys You know, that big flower they have at the football game.
Come on.
So that's what you did all day?
You bought two plastic plants.
No, that's not all I did.
I did some coordinatin'.
Then I defrosted the refrigerator.
Then I killed all the flies in the kitchen.
And what did you do that was so great?
Well, I'm glad you asked me, Pop, because this is what separates the little businessman from the big businessman the lamb from the wolf and the cow from the bull.
Okay.
Then let's cut out the bull and tell me.
All right.
While you was here coordinatin' and killin' flies I went out there and bought, for a measly 20 bucks the most fantastic piece of cabinetmaking ever came into this yard.
- You did?
Well, where is it?
- Just come with me, Pop.
- Don't push on me.
- I just want you to come this way.
I be lookin' good.
Now, sit over here, Pop, and close your eyes.
- What is this, some kind of joke?
- It's no joke.
Just close your eyes.
Okay, now keep 'em closed.
I'm a-keepin' 'em closed.
- Don't open 'em.
- I ain't gonna open 'em.
Okay, Pop.
Now you can look.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
Only one thing.
What is it?
It's a commode.
A who?
A commode.
You do know what a commode is, don't you?
Yeah, that's a Japanese bathrobe.
That's kimono.
This is a commode, and it's from the early 1800s, Pop.
I checked it out.
And you paid 20 bucks for it?
Yeah, plus a couple of balloons for this lady's kids that I bought it off of.
- White woman?
- Yeah.
- Ugly?
- Yeah.
Naturally.
Look, see, and they try to make such a big deal out of furniture that's over a hundred years old.
That's the only kind of stuff we got around here.
This chick didn't know what it was.
She thought it was terrible.
She didn't want it 'cause it didn't fit in with the rest of her furniture.
How'd you know what it was?
I stopped off at this antique shop and the guy gave me all the information on it.
You know what we could get for this at an auction?
Between three and four hundred dollars.
- You kiddin' me.
- No, I'm not.
Just look at it.
Now, look at that quality.
Look at that finish.
Look underneath where it says, "Made in Japan.
" Would you stop it.
Now, I described this to the guy at the antique shop.
He said that it sounded like real English Regency.
So, it's a nice piece of furniture, but what's it for?
"What's it for"?
I already told you.
It's a commode.
Here, look, Pop.
You ready?
It's a chamber pot.
Of course it's a chamber pot.
What do you expect a commode to have in it, a derby?
That's the whole point.
This was an important part of the furnishings back then.
It was the only sanitation system that they had.
But ain't no chain.
Of course there's no chain.
That wasn't invented yet.
The modern toilet didn't come on the scene until much later.
Now, you told me yourself that we didn't have a toilet until 1935.
No, 1934.
I bought one to celebrate gettin' a job on the WPA.
Well, back in the 1800s in the early 1800s this is all anybody had.
Everybody used these, even royalty.
Kings and queens.
- They did?
- Sure.
You didn't expect them to have a little house with a half-moon on the door in the back of Buckingham Palace, did you?
No, but where did they keep 'em?
Wherever they needed 'em.
On the landing.
In the bedroom.
Sometimes when they had a banquet they put it behind a screen in the dining room.
I don't believe that.
That's what the guy at the antique shop told me.
He said that they wasn't so hung up about stuff like this the way we are now.
If a guy got caught short during a meal he'd run behind that screen, and zip he'd be back out there in time for the next course.
He wouldn't even miss none of the conversation.
That's disgusting.
I mean, that's really disgusting.
It is not, Pop.
That's only because you're judging it by today's standards.
That's the way it was back then.
I don't care how it was back then.
Suppertime is suppertime and when it's somethin' else time, it's somethin' else time.
Well, that's the way it was, and this is an important one too.
Look here on the side.
You see that on the side?
That's another reason why this is so valuable.
What's that?
Well, that's the Prince of Wales's feathers.
See?
This is his crest.
I wouldn't be surprised if this didn't belong to the prince himself.
You are looking at history.
I am lookin' at a toilet.
Anyway, I'm gonna take it into one of them fancy antique shops over in Beverly Hills.
They gonna flip when they see this.
You say you can get three or four hundred dollars for it?
At least.
If we could get our hands on more stuff like this, we could retire.
Now, see, Lamont.
That's the thing that bothers me.
If this thing is worth that much money why did you only give the woman $20, even though it was an ugly white woman?
- What are you talking about?
- Sanford and Son's got a reputation for payin' a fair price.
That's how we got a good name in this business.
It's not my fault if people don't know what they're selling.
I didn't do nothin' wrong.
Wasn't it you that told me to do unto others before they can do it unto you?
It's just somethin' that is not right.
I don't understand you.
This ain't like you, man.
You'll feel better tomorrow morning once you sleep on it.
I ain't gonna sleep on it.
I ain't gonna feel better 'cause I ain't gonna sleep on it and I ain't gonna sit on it.
I'm gonna fix me something to eat.
I ain't in no commode business.
I'm in the junk business.
- Mr. Sanford?
- Yeah.
Mr. Sanford, you were at my house this morning and bought a Regency commode from my wife.
Is that right?
No, I was the one that was at your house.
What about it?
You paid her $20 for it, didn't you?
I bought something that might or might not be an antique.
So?
- Well, it is.
- We don't know that, do we?
- Is there something wrong?
- Yes, there is something wrong.
I'd like to discuss it with you.
May I come in?
- I knew it.
I knew it.
- Yeah, come on in.
Thank you.
There it is!
Thank goodness you didn't sell it!
There's been a mistake.
My wife shouldn't have sold you this piece.
You see, she didn't know the value of it.
- I knew it.
I knew it.
- That's not my fault, man.
- She agreed to the price.
- You took advantage of her!
I knew it.
I knew it.
- Just what is it you want, Mr - Osborne.
You're an antique dealer.
At least that's what your card says.
You must have known it was worth more than $20.
We didn't know that.
I swear.
We thought it was a spittoon.
It's people like you that give the antique business a bad name.
I knew it.
I knew it.
You knew I knew it when I told you I knew it.
It's underhanded dealing, that's what it is.
Talking innocent housewives out of parting with their antiques and then paying them practically nothing for it.
- It's underhanded.
- Yes, it's underhanded.
Your wife couldn't wait to get this out of the house.
Because you talked her out of it.
Now, that's very unfair.
Very unfair.
That's very unfair.
Very unfair.
Would you stop it.
Don't go accusing me of doing nothin' underhanded.
Tell your wife to be more careful in the future.
Is that all you have to say?
Is that all you have to say?
Because if it is, Mr. Sanford, you're behaving like a cad.
Yeah, you're behaving like a What's that you called my son?
- A cad.
- Yeah.
You're behavin' like one of them, and a dummy too.
Excuse me, Mr. Osborne.
I'd like to talk to him for a minute, if that's all right.
- Don't be pushin' me.
- Go inside there.
This is my business deal.
I'm the one that brought the thing in the house.
Is there something else that you wanted to talk to me about, Mr. Osborne?
Only this.
I've got to have that piece back.
I'd be happy to sell it back to you.
Good.
I'll even offer you a little profit on the deal.
How about $30?
- We'll take it.
- No, it's worth more than that.
You're making $10 on All right, all right.
$50.
We'll take it.
You're gonna have to go higher than that.
- Seventy-five?
- He's offering us $75 for a toilet!
This toilet happened to belong to the Prince of Wales, didn't it, Mr. Osborne?
All right.
You've got me over a barrel.
I'll give you $200 for it.
Lamont!
Two hundred!
Would you stop it!
It's worth a lot more than that, and he knows it.
If you put it up for auction, you'd have to pay a commission and then take whatever price came in.
Two hundred is very fair.
Very fair.
Two hundred is very fair.
Very fair.
All right.
To show you I'm not a hard businessman, I'll take it.
May I write you a check?
Yeah.
Put your address and phone number on the back.
Not exactly a bad profit for a day's work, is it?
Hey, man, that's the way it goes.
I'll have someone come and pick it up in the morning.
Now, one thing more, Mr. Sanford.
If I hear about you doing something like this again I'm going to report you to the Better Business Bureau.
I'm not a member.
Well I know somebody else who'd be interested in all of this.
It's Ralph Nader.
Is he in antique toilets?
Ah, $200.
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- Are you gonna start that again?
Yes, I'm gonna start that again, taking advantage of people.
If I wanted to take advantage of him I could have charged him twice as much.
You heard the man.
He would have paid anything to get that back.
Two hundred dollars.
Two hundred dollars for a toilet that ain't got no chains!
- What's the matter with you?
- You know what's the matter with me.
Don't tell me you're still mad about that commode business.
Forget about it.
I can't.
I hate to see you taking advantage of people.
This is Sanford and Son, not Shakedown and Son.
Ho-ho-ho.
What does that mean, "Ho-ho-ho"?
I bought something for about $20, and I sold it for 200.
- That's a 1,000% profit, right?
- Right.
You had an old suit layin' around here that you paid two dollars for and you sold it to that Mexican guy down the street for 20.
Now, that's a 1,000% profit.
So, ho-ho-ho.
Well, that was different.
See, everybody was satisfied with my deal.
See, that Mexican fella, he was happy as a clam 'cause he ain't never had a three-piece suit before.
But you didn't tell him that knickers was out of style, did you?
Well, knickers ain't out of style.
I saw a picture in the paper the other day.
You know the head man in Yugoslavia?
What's his name?
Toto?
Tito.
Toto was the dog in The Wizard of Oz.
Well, I get 'em mixed up.
Anyway, he had on some knickers and he was out huntin', and he looked great.
Huntin', yeah but you don't wear knickers to apply for a job in a restaurant.
That's the whole point, Pop.
You took advantage of somebody.
At least I took advantage of some people that could afford it.
It just ain't right, and you ain't gonna make it right.
- 'Cause you didn't do it, that's why.
- You just a cad.
- Yes?
- Good afternoon.
Are you open?
Yeah, we open to the public - Come on in.
- Splendid.
My name is Bonnet.
Emile Bonnet.
Antiques.
"Beverly Hills, New York, Rome, Milan.
" I ship to Italy twice a year.
At one time we were buying everything they had to sell.
Now it's the other way around.
Yeah, you could say that again.
In any case, I like to explore in the strangest places and this is certainly a strange place.
I say, that's rather bizarre.
Oh, no, no.
That's my father.
No, no.
I was referring to the piece behind him.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to laugh at you, but your son did make a funny.
Yeah.
He's a regularJerk Benny.
Well, now, let's see what we have here that's interesting.
This glass cabinet.
Is it period?
Yeah, it's the only glass cabinet we got, period.
You have a nice sense of humor too, don't you?
Yeah, I get off a good one every now and then.
- Say, listen, you Italian?
- Oh, I'm a little of everything.
Italian, Greek, Turkish.
Even Syrian and Dutch.
You must've had to take a lot of shots to get in this country.
- Oh, yes, indeed.
- Yeah, well, look around.
We got a lot of nice stuff here.
You ever been to Switzerland?
- On occasion.
- Maybe you could use this sled.
No, I think not.
- What about Africa?
You been there?
- I travel all over the world.
In that case you probably could use this spear when you get to Africa.
If not, you could use it in New York City.
- On the subway.
- Now, then - At night.
- The point is - When you by yourself.
- No, thank you.
I really don't Good heavens.
This is incredible.
Exquisite.
A magnificent Hepplewhite.
Is it for sale?
- Yes.
- No.
Yes, it is.
This is the finest example of a Regency commode that I've ever seen.
I don't believe it.
The Prince of Wales feathers.
Do you realize what this must mean?
Undoubtedly this was used by the prince himself.
Fantastic.
I'll take it.
- You can't have it.
- Pop!
- I'll give you $900 for it.
- It's been sold!
Did you say $900?
Nine hundred.
I already have a customer for it.
Sophia Loren will buy this sight unseen.
- It's already sold!
- It is not!
- It is!
- It isn't!
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Which is it?
Would you excuse us for a moment?
We want to talk for a minute.
- Yes, of course.
- Just excuse us.
Let's go.
If you don't give me this pot and mind your own business I'm gonna lock you upstairs in your room.
You can't sell that.
It's against the rules!
I make my own rules.
It's crooked.
I want no part of it.
Good.
Then stay out of it.
- Good.
I ain't gonna say no more.
- Fine!
- Don't ask me no more.
- Perfect.
That toilet is gonna put us in the toilet.
Would you stay out of this and let me handle it, please?
You got no sense.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bonnet.
It was just a little business conference in there.
If you've already sold the piece, let's forget it.
I wouldn't want to get involved in anything unethical.
Oh, no.
It was just a little misunderstanding.
It can all be straightened out with the stroke of a pen.
Yeah, a Federal pen.
- I beg your pardon?
- Nothing.
Nothing at all.
You did say $900, didn't you?
Right.
I'll call back in two days to make sure it's for sale.
That's fine, but don't worry about a thing.
The guy that owns this doesn't like it, his wife doesn't want it.
I'll buy it back from him and offer him a little profit.
- Do you think he'll go for it?
- I'm sure he will.
You can just tell Sophia Loren that this pot is as good as hers.
Why, it'll be great for makin' pasta in.
If you can establish sole title to the piece, we have a deal.
And please try.
If necessary, I might even go higher than 900.
- Don't worry.
I'll get it.
- I hope so.
Good day.
- Buon giorno, Mr. Sanford.
- Yeah, bum journey to you too.
Don't say a word.
Not one word.
I won't say one word.
I'll spell it for you.
D-U-M-M-Y period.
Hello.
Can I speak to a Mr. Emile Bonnet, please?
What?
Isn't this 654-1654?
Mr. Bonnet was at my place about three days ago and he was inquiring about a commode, and I was calling him back to tell him that I have it ready for him.
There's no Mr. Bonnet there?
Who am I calling?
Okay.
Thank you.
Hey, Pop, you know that phone number that Bonnet gave me three days ago?
It was to a McDonald's hamburger place.
I don't understand it and after I got Osborne to sell it back to me for 300 bucks.
So, in other words, you're into this pot here for $320.
How do you figure that?
I still got Osborne's check for $200 in the bank.
So this only cost me 120, and Bonnet's offered me 900 for it.
So I'm still in the clear.
But the question is, where is Mr. Bonnet?
Maybe you should call McDonald's in Rome.
I mean, you're just you're just dumb, son.
See, you've been conned.
You've been conned, robbed and ripped off.
- What are you talkin' about?
- Sit down.
This is gonna take some time.
See, now, these two guys were workin' together.
The first guy comes in here complaining that you took advantage of his wife.
And he buys a commode off you and even gives you a profit.
Now you know it's valuable.
So then here comes the second guy, the antique dealer and he tells you if you can buy it back off the other guy he'll buy it from you.
So, you give the first guy, Osborne, a check for $300 made out to cash.
He rushes to the bank to cash it and you don't see neither of these guys again.
You don't believe me, do you?
- I believe you, except for two things.
- What?
I already put the check for $200 in the bank and I still got the valuable commode.
And I called the bank this morning, and the check is still bouncing and I had a guy come in here this morning and appraise this commode.
- And?
- They're worth 20 bucks each.
He said he had appraised Those two guys had worked this whole neighborhood.
Son, you've been had bad.
I can't believe it.
It's your own fault.
If you hadn't been greedy, they couldn't work the deal.
You see, son, always remember what the Bible said.
He that liveth by the sword shall be stucketh.
Hello, son, I got your lunch ready.
I got some tuna fish and mayonnaise and it's nice and wet, the way you like it.
That's good, Pop.
I happened to see that you had the commode out with a For Sale sign on it.
- How much you think you'll get for it?
- Well, I paid 20.
So I'll try for 30.
I could ask for 40 and probably get 50 but I should say 60 and get around 70.
But I'm pretty sure I can get 80.
Now who's taking advantage?
No, but I put a lot of work into it.
I waxed it, polished it and tightened all the knobs on the drawers.
That's another thing that I noticed.
The pot is missing.
You gonna get $80 for something that don't even have the most important part.
But it's not.
I put a lot of work into it, and I'll show you.
That's what makes it expensive.
Sit down and close your eyes.
- Sit on down and close your eyes.
- Is this some joke?
It's no joke.
You did it to me, and I'm gonna do it to you.
Sit down, and don't peek.
Don't peek.
You can open your eyes.
See?
I bet the Prince of Wales would've liked this.
It'd be like going in the woods.
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
- Hey, Pop, I'm home.
- Hello, son.
All this paperwork sure gets to you.
Oh, yeah?
What you been doing all day?
What's it look like?
Been keeping the books.
Oh, let me have a look.
No, that's okay.
I like to keep my book in order.
- I'll take care of it.
- Let me just look at it.
I thought you Bookmark.
Fifty-two of'em?
I lose my place a lot.
So I've been playing a little cards.
Who are you, the FBI?
Played a little cards.
Had a little drink.
Took a little nap.
Anything else?
How would you like a little one of these across your lip?
Never mind.
Just come on out here and help me unload this truck.
Gets pretty lonesome around here, you know.
A man can just do so much coordinating.
It'd be different if I had a wife or a dog.
- Why don't you get yourself one?
- A wife?
No, a dog.
Come on out here.
Walk around here like you own the place.
It's still Sanford and Son and not Son and Sanford.
- Hold it.
- What's the matter?
Don't take nothing off until I tell you.
You want me to coordinate this inventory or don't you?
Now what you got there?
One five-foot length of one-inch pipe.
May I take it off now?
One five-foot length of one-inch pipe.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Don't just throw it anywhere.
- What is that, galvanized iron?
- Yeah.
Well, put it in the "Gl" section.
That's That's "Gl" for galvanized iron.
- "HC" section?
- Huh?
Hubcaps.
You want me to put them in "HC"?
Let me see.
No, put them in "GC".
Garbage can.
You're ridiculous, you know that?
Jason, how'd you get in there?
Who is this kid?
What are you doing here?
It's Jason.
A kid I know from the route.
He sneaked a ride.
You shouldn't have done that.
You could have got hurt.
What you looking for, kid?
Hubcaps?
Radio aerials?
Frisk him, Lamont.
Wait a minute, Pop.
He's not a thief.
He's a little kid.
- Well, how old are you?
- Nine.
Well, you look 21.
I'll bet you he's a short thief.
Either that or he's a midget.
If there's one thing I hate it's a midget who goes around stealing for a living.
Hey, Pop, I'm telling you, I know this kid.
Good.
All right, kid, you had your ride.
Go home.
Can't I just play here for a little while?
No, you can't.
Get outta my chair.
You can't play here for no little while.
You'll be running around here and cut your foot on something rusty.
You know what you get when you cut your foot on something rusty?
- What?
- Lockjaw.
Then you won't be able to eat no more Fat Burgers.
Pop.
Look, Jason, you can stay around here and play but be careful and don't get into nothing, okay?
- Thanks, Lamont.
- All right.
Say, listen.
What are you doing?
You'll get us in trouble with that kid playing around here.
What's wrong with that?
You know what a lawyer calls a junkyard?
An attractive nuisance.
- A what?
- An attractive nuisance.
- And where did you hear that?
- On a Perry Mason rerun.
- Are you gonna start?
- No, see, it's true.
See, this millionaire named Marcel Colton called Perry Mason.
But see, Perry Mason was taking a steam bath so he had to talk to Perry Mason's secretary.
- I don't wanna hear about it.
- Della Street.
She's good-looking for a white woman.
I'd like to ask Perry Mason if he'd come out here and help me lift this stove off this truck.
Well, you better ask him, because I ain't gonna lift it.
- Oh, why not?
- Are you kidding?
If I lift this stove, tomorrow I'll be wearing a truss.
- Come on, Pop.
- I don't mind wearing one but it'll mess up the crease in my pants.
So, in other words, you're not gonna do it.
In other words, I don't want a hernia.
You see, I'm at that age now where I could get one.
Really.
It's called "HP".
- "HP"?
- Yeah, hernia prone.
Is that something else I should ask Perry Mason?
No, you should ask "MW".
That's Marcus Welby.
You see, he had this story where this guy on the show, he was a piano mover.
- I don't wanna hear about it.
- He was a piano mover and after his 21 st wedding anniversary, he started walking funny.
- Know what I mean?
- I said I don't wanna hear about it.
Let's forget about the work for today and go inside and eat.
- Jason!
- I bet he took off.
I bet he took off with some of my valuable stuff.
What valuable stuff?
A refrigerator, a stove, a sink.
I mean, it's a gold mine out here.
And I suppose a little kid took off with all that heavy stuff, right?
Well, maybe he's not alone.
Maybe he's in the syndicate.
Just like that story I saw on Mod Squad.
I don't wanna hear about it.
Jason!
Here he comes now.
Look how his pockets is bulgin'.
Say, kid, what you got there in your back pockets?
Nothing, Mr. Sanford.
That's me.
Everything you eat must go straight to your back pockets.
Stop it.
Now look, Jason.
We're gonna go inside and have our dinner now.
Yeah, so you better get on home, Jason.
Good-bye, Jason.
You can remember how to get home.
It's not that far.
- Good-bye, Jason.
- Yeah, so you better go now or your mother's gonna be real worried about you.
- Yeah, good-bye, Jason.
- She's not home.
- She's what?
- She's not home.
She's working.
Oh.
Well, good-bye, Jason.
Wait a minute.
Just wait a minute.
Hey, would you like to have dinner with us?
- I sure would!
- What's wrong with you?
- Why don't you let the kid go home?
- Excuse me a minute, Jason.
Now look.
Let the kid eat with us if he wants to.
Listen, Lamont.
Let him go home.
Kids are just like cats.
You feed him, and he'll be hanging around here forever.
What are you talking about?
He's got a home.
Then let him go to it.
Good-bye, Jason.
Would you wait a minute?
It's not as if we don't have enough food.
- What are we having for dinner?
- Chicken.
Four backs and three necks.
- Well, that's enough.
- Enough for two, but not for three.
- Good-bye, Jason.
- Would you listen to me?
I'll give him one of my backs.
Well, it's your back and not my neck.
Good.
Come on, Jason.
I'll go upstairs and get cleaned up, and I'll be right back down.
Say, kid, don't touch none of that stuff.
That's valuable.
Yeah, this is valuable stuff here.
You know what this is?
Uh-huh, junk.
Don't be funny.
You might be younger than I am, but I can still give you one of these.
- You got that?
- Yes, sir.
Come on in the kitchen and wash your hands.
If you're gonna eat with us, you gotta wash your hands.
- You wash your hands?
- Yes, sir.
Good.
You're always supposed to wash your hands every time before you eat.
And from the looks of you, you should have the cleanest hands on your block.
- Now, you like chicken?
- Yes, sir.
What do you like, backs or necks?
I like necks.
You do, huh?
Well, you know, backs are better for you.
Yeah, but I like necks.
Yeah, well, see, backs are the best for you.
Because if you eat necks, you might get one of them bones in your throat and then you'll grow a chicken neck.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Haven't you seen people with them little chicken necks?
Real ugly.
Then when you grow up, you won't even be able to get a shave.
You'll have to go have your neck plucked.
Now what do you want?
- I'll take the back.
- Good boy.
Go finish drying your hands.
I'll go get another chair.
You sit down right here.
I'll be back in a minute.
That's a fine thing you did, inviting that kid here for dinner.
What are you grumbling for?
He's just one kid.
Yeah, it's one now, but tomorrow he'll bring friends and there'll be more.
And then the next day more.
Then pretty soon it'll be some more.
That's how Boys Town got started.
- Come on.
- Yeah.
I'm Papa Sanford, not Father Flanagan.
Say, and get that chair there and bring it in here.
Jason, what would you like to drink?
A glass of milk?
- Okay.
- What about a beer?
- Pop, children do not drink beer.
- What's wrong with that?
It's just got some barley and some grain and stuff in it.
You know, just cornflakes in a can.
- No beer.
- Okay, I'll get the drinks.
Hey, Jason, what do you like, the necks or the backs?
Back, please.
Well, don't you like necks?
Yeah, but I'm afraid to swallow a bone because I'll grow up with a chicken neck.
- Who told you that?
- Your dad.
Well, it's true.
It is true.
See, I had a cousin, Big SunnyJim Haywood.
He always eat chickens, and he eat the chicken neck and he grew up with a chicken neck.
Funny little neck.
He couldn't get a collar to fit him.
And one night, him and his wife had an argument and she almost choked him to death with one hand.
Stop it.
And his twin brother, LittleJimmy Haywood he used to get the other end of the chicken.
And when he grew up, his face looked exactly like I said that's enough!
You know.
- Is it good, Jason?
- It sure is.
It's the best chicken back I ever ate.
Yeah, that's because I cook them special.
See, a lot of folks just Shake 'N' Bake but I buy and fry.
- You really like it, huh?
- Yes, sir.
You're a great cook, Mr. Sanford.
You know what?
- You oughta own your own restaurant.
- Well, you mean that, huh?
Well, look here.
Why don't you take one of these necks?
And just be careful now and don't get none of them small bones in your throat.
Thank you.
- Thunder.
Sounds like a storm.
- I'm scared of thunder.
Jason, ain't nothing to be scared of.
Don't you know what thunder is?
It's nothing but electricity in the atmosphere.
Why are you telling him a thing like that?
You'll scare him to death.
Electricity in the atmosphere.
All right, what is thunder?
What makes that sound?
Well, it's Thunder?
That's the black angels tap dancing.
Don't worry, Jason.
If a storm comes up, I'll take you home.
Okay?
- Okay.
Lamont?
- Yeah?
Is it okay if I sleep here tonight?
- No.
- Wait a minute.
Stop it.
- No.
- Would you hold on a minute?
If your mother comes home and you're not there - she'll be worried about you.
- She won't be home.
She's staying overnight on this job.
- Well, what about your father?
- I don't have a father.
You mean if you went home tonight, you'd be all alone?
Hey, it's okay.
You can stay with us.
- Oh, boy, thanks!
- Look, Jason.
Why don't you go see if the windows are closed in the living room?
See that, Lamont.
What did I tell you?
Didn't I tell you?
Kids are just like cats.
You feed them, and they'll be around here forever.
You heard him.
No father, his mother's working and a storm is coming up.
Now who are you, Simon Legree?
No, and I'm not Conrad Hilton either.
Pop, it's only gonna be for one night.
I'll take the kid home the first thing in the morning.
Just relax.
It ain't enough for me to be around here with one dummy.
Now I got to have a dummy and a half.
It's okay, Mr. Sanford, they're shut.
- How many you want?
- Four.
Four?
Four?
Ain't no way to play poker.
Only a dummy would draw four cards.
Here.
I'll take two.
- How much you bet?
- I'll bet $100.
A hundred?
Say, is that a bee over there?
I don't see no bee.
You bet a hundred.
Well, I'll call your hundred and raise you a hundred.
You call?
Well, read 'em and weep.
Aces over jacks.
What you got?
- Four kings.
- Four kings?
Now you owe me $650.
Okay.
I'll show you another game.
This is a new game.
Here.
Now, here's the way it goes.
Three for you and four for me.
Two for you and one, two, three for me.
Now look at your cards.
We ante up a hundred in front.
Now what you do?
- Now what?
- Bet $100.
How do you know who wins?
- How many cards you got?
- Five.
I got seven.
I win.
Let's play that game again.
Okay, then I'll deal again.
Oh, it's Lamont.
Hey, Pop.
Jason, what are you still doing here?
It's 4:00.
What's the matter with you, Pop?
When I left this morning, you wouldn't let me wake him.
- Now I come home and he's here.
- Well, he was keeping me company.
And he was helping me coordinating.
Wasn't you?
Is coordinating the same as playing poker?
Poker?
You was teaching a little kid how to play poker?
- He wasn't, Lamont.
- See?
I was teaching him.
We gotta get you home.
Your mother's probably worried sick.
Why didn't you call and tell her he was here?
I asked him, and he wouldn't give me his phone number.
Come here, Jason.
You got a phone at home?
Okay, what's the number?
Hey, look.
Now, your mother's been working hard all day.
When she comes home and you ain't there, it's gonna make her sick.
You don't wanna make your mother sick, do you?
- What's her name?
- Winnie.
- Her last name.
- He ain't gonna tell you.
Any kid who can draw four kings ain't gonna give you his phone number.
- We gotta get him home.
- Okay.
Listen, Jason.
Now you know you got to go.
- You can't hang around here forever.
- Why not?
Because this is not your house, and I'm not your father.
If you marry my mother, you could be.
Oh, no.
Forget that.
I ain't marrying nobody.
Come here, Jason.
You can come around here and play anytime you want to but you gotta tell me your phone number so I can call your mother.
- Now what is it?
- Go ahead, Jason.
Tell him, or I ain't gonna be your poker pal.
- I'll tell.
- Good.
Oops.
What do you say, Lamont?
What's happening?
- Mr. Sanford, how are you?
- What's going on, Fred?
- Where you been so long?
- Fighting crime in the streets.
We are gonna get it to the point where people can walk anywhere in Los Angeles.
Yeah, but they'll still be running in Watts.
Hey, is that the little man, Lamont?
Yeah, this is Jason.
Jason, come over here, man.
- You're not scared, are you?
- Don't be scared, sonny.
- A man in blue is a friend to you.
- Yeah, but - You know - man in blue, get your foot off there.
Oh, sorry.
You know, in the lawman-juvenile relationship the primary consideration is the establishment of an atmosphere of mutual trust between the official and the minor in question.
Be cool, little brother.
The fuzz is your cuz.
Yeah, we just wanna ask a few questions is all.
- How'd you know he was here?
- Oh, on the way home I ran into Smitty and Hoppy and told them Jason spent the night last night.
- He ain't done nothing.
- We just wanna check him out.
You know, to make sure he didn't run away or something.
You got a lot of runaways now, huh?
Oh, yes.
It's an age-old problem.
Didn't you ever run away from home, Mr. Sanford?
No, but I had a brother who used to run away about at least once a month.
Is that so?
What finally happened?
His wife divorced him.
He's talking about kids.
We wanna have a chat with the youngster and make sure everything is cold.
- Cool!
- Cool.
Jason?
Jason!
He's gone.
Sure he's gone.
You bring two policemen here and scare him half to death.
He did what any normal American kid would do split.
Now don't worry, Mr. Sanford.
We'll try and track him down.
See if we can't reassure him.
We'll just check out the neighborhood.
I'm sure everything will be gravy.
- Groovy!
I'll see you.
- Groovy.
Groovy.
You big dummy, you see that?
You bring those policemen here, and Jason will be a runaway kid.
You know what he'll be doing?
He'll be in the penitentiary writing his story.
And you know who he's gonna name it after?
You.
You know what he's gonna call it?
"Superfink.
" - That's enough.
- That's right.
And then when he gets out, he'll come looking for you like I saw in a picture once with Humphrey Bogart.
A guy sent Humphrey Bogart up to the penitentiary and when he got out, he came looking for this guy.
He had a gun with two bullets in it, and I'll never forget how he said this.
He said, "Listen.
I got two bullets in this gun.
One for me and one for you, sweetheart.
" I'm going outside and look forJason.
Come out and look if you want to but you ain't gonna find him, 'cause by now he's across the border, sweetheart.
Jason!
Jason, are you out here?
Jason, you out here?
If you're out here, say so.
If you're not, say so, too, so we won't be making fools out of ourselves.
Lamont, come here.
You know, I think Jason is somewhere - out here in the yard, hiding.
- You think so?
- I'll bet he is.
- I'll bet he ain't.
Jason, what'd you run away for?
Why'd you do that?
I was afraid those cops were going to take me down to juvenile hall.
We wouldn't let them do that.
Come back in the house.
Yeah, come on in.
I'm gonna fix you a nice chicken dinner.
- Necks and backs?
- No, gizzards and feet.
Before the police came, you was gonna tell us your phone number at home.
- Now what is it?
- I don't remember.
- Come on, Jason, tell him.
- I don't remember.
- Okay, no gizzards and feet.
- 292-7399.
Okay, that's better.
It's the police.
They're back again.
- Let me go!
- Just calm down.
- Jason, where have you been?
- Mama!
- I've been worried sick.
- This is the little guy's mother.
She put in a report that her son was missing.
Didn't I tell you your mother would be worried?
He told us that you'd be working all day.
That's true, but he was supposed to go to his aunt's house - and stay with her overnight.
- He didn't tell us that.
Jason, what have you been doing all this time?
Playing poker with Mr. Sanford.
No, wait a minute.
We was just playing for fun.
He owes me $650.
Well, you better pay up.
We'll be on our way now, ma'am.
Bye.
Good-bye, and thank you so much for your help.
Yeah.
Smitty and Hoppy, you all did a great job.
Thank you.
We like to think of ourselves as like the Canadian Mounted Police.
You know, we always get our man.
Yeah, why don't you guys celebrate and get yourself a woman?
Well, so long, father.
- Brother!
- Brother.
Brother.
Well, we'll be going too.
Oh, no.
Don't rush off.
Why don't you stay and have dinner with us?
Can we, Mama, please?
Well, I certainly don't wanna cause you any more trouble.
No trouble.
This calls for a celebration.
- We'll have a nice chicken dinner.
- Gizzards and feet?
No, legs and thighs.
Say, Lamont, why don't you takeJason out in the yard and show him how to dribble a basketball?
- Okay.
- And, Winnie why don't you come into the kitchen with me while I flour these legs?
Hey, what's the matter with you?
- Oh, nothing.
- I know what it is.
You miss Jason.
Come on.
Tell the truth.
Yeah, well, I got sort of used to having him around.
It was like having a little son in the place.
Hey, Pop, you got a son.
Remember?
No, it ain't the same.
You've changed since you got big and grew your own mustache.
I wonder where Jason is today.
I don't know, but I know what I'd do if I was a mayor or if I had a lot of money.
I'd build a big park so kids could play in it kids running around likeJason.
A park?
Yeah, a park where you can get them off the street and they could play and stay out of trouble.
- Jason!
- Hello, Mr. Sanford.
Hi, Lamont.
- Say, Jason, what are you doing here?
- Mr. Sanford remember you said it'd be all right if I came back here and played?
- Yeah.
Anytime.
- Well, is it?
- Hey, great!
Okay, you guys!
- Good.
Yea!
Sanford and Son is recorded on tape before a live studio audience.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Lamont!
Lamont!
Come on down.
I got your lunch ready.
Soup a la Fred.
Lamont, come on down!
Why'd you have to get dressed up for lunch?
Now I gotta put napkins on the table.
I hope it's something light, Pop.
I've gotta go someplace, and I don't wanna eat too much.
Well, it's light, but it's fillin'.
Cream of leftover meat loaf.
- What's cream of leftover meat loaf?
- Soup of the day.
I'm not eatin' no soup that you made.
Listen, this soup is good.
It's not like out of the can.
It's homemade, and it's good.
You know, like that song?
M'm, m'm, good M'm, m'm, good Sanford's meat loaf soup is m'm, m'm, good I'm not eatin' it, 'cause you're always lappin' in the soup.
Nobody don't wanna eat no soup after you done lapped in it.
- I ain't been lappin' in it.
- Then how you know it's good?
I smelled it.
That's even worse.
Sniffin' in the soup.
Cream of dirty old man soup, and I ain't eatin' it!
I spent half of the morning over that hot stove and you ain't gonna eat this soup?
I told you I wasn't hungry.
I got something to do.
- That why you all dressed up?
- Yeah.
I got a very important interview this afternoon.
- What kind of interview?
- I'll tell you if you promise not to go blabbing it all over the neighborhood.
My lips are locked.
I'm goin' to see a man about gettin' a part in a movie.
It's one of them low-budget fiIms done by an independent fiIm company and they pay you $50 a day.
Once the fiIm comes out, I could be discovered.
Now tell me the one about Goldilocks and the three bears.
Why don't you believe me?
Same reason I don't believe in the Easter Bunny.
I got good sense.
That's the very thing that makes me mad at you, Pop.
Any old dog or cat could come in here off the street and tell you he was startin' a movie career and you'd be askin' him for an autograph.
But let me, your own flesh and blood tell you the same thing, and you put me down.
- It's not right.
- Any old dog or cat could have talent.
And I suppose I don't have no talent, huh?
You ain't got talent to be a junk man.
Maybe you could be a movie star.
You see that?
That's why I don't eat soup that you make 'cause you always lappin' in it!
I ain't lappin' in it.
You ain't gonna eat none?
- No.
- Then I was lappin' in it.
Say, what was this movie about, anyway?
I don't know.
I'm going to meet with the director and the producer.
In fact, Rollo should have been here ten minutes ago.
What?
Rollo?
Did you say Rollo?
Yeah, he's the one that told me about it.
If you and Rollo gonna be in a movie, I got the perfect name for it.
"Super Dummies.
" I'm not gonna be a dummy much longer.
Listen, as long as there's a Rollo, you'll be a dummy.
He takes advantage of you 'cause you got an empty head.
Your head is empty.
That's why you make a good pair.
Rollo and Hollow.
- I don't wanna talk about it no more.
- Good.
- I ain't gonna say no more about it.
- Thank you.
- You got into this on your own.
- Right.
I ain't gonna tell you what I'm thinkin'.
Good.
I think you're a bigger fool than I thought you were.
What's the matter with you?
Come on in, Rollo.
Is that Rollo?
I didn't know you came out in the daytime.
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Oh, listen.
I don't have a picture of myself.
You think I'm gonna need one?
I hope not, 'cause I ain't got a picture of myself either.
Rollo, why don't you go down to the post office and take one of your pictures down off the wall?
- Come on.
Let's go.
- Wait.
I ain't through talkin' yet.
Listen, Rollo, I don't like the way you're always gettin' my son messed up in your crazy schemes.
Hey, Pops!
This movie don't fall into that category.
This movie's on the for real side, jack.
- You ain't got to explain to him.
- Yes, I do.
Ajoke is a joke, but why you treat me like a criminal when I come here?
'Cause I want you to feel at home.
Man, you behind the times, Mr. Sanford.
This is the golden age of fiImmaking for the black man.
Those studios are searchin' high and low for star material like myself and Lamont.
That's right, Pop.
Black is very profitable right now.
Studios in Hollywood is comin' out with black fiIms faster than cars are comin' off the assembly lines.
From what I've seen of some of'em they oughta send 'em back for correction like they do them cars that come off the assembly line.
In the old days, movies were movies, and stars were stars.
Louise Beavers, Rex Ingram, Lena Horne.
But nowadays, any fool they cut loose from a football team right away they stick him in front of a camera and call it a movie.
You got to crawl before you walk, jack.
Personally, I'm happy to be numbered among the brothers - taking these great strides forward.
- Me too.
Even if I don't make it, it won't be because I didn't try.
I don't plan to spend my life pumpin' gas and changin' oil.
I don't plan to spend my life sellin'junk.
Then why don't you pump gas and oil and you go sell junk?
- Let's get outta here.
- Wait a minute.
I wanna show your old man this ain't jive nonsense we into.
What is that, a summons?
This is our passport out of the valley of the shadow of poverty and straight into the splendor that is Beverly Hills.
And up the river to the penitentiary.
Hey, come on, man.
Let's get in the wind.
There they go, Frick and Frack.
Two big-time movie stars.
"Wanted" That sound like Rollo already.
"Wanted: Black movie actors and actresses for exciting fiIm by revolutionary, independent fiIm company.
Yes, that means you, Mister and Miss Untapped Talent.
Are you tired of a lackluster life?
This is your chance to take your rightful place with the stars and celebrities that you've watched through the years.
You too can be a movie star.
No previous experience needed.
" Well, them two dummies can be a movie star, so can I. And they don't have the profile I got.
And I know I can act.
Ronald Colman.
If I were king the stars would be your jury and the sun would be your light.
If I were king.
Charles Laughton.
Come here, Mr. Christian!
Yeah.
Come on in.
Can I help you?
My son, Lamont Sanford, and his friend came down here.
He left this with me in case I wanted to get in a movie too.
You must mean those two guys that just got here.
Wait a minute.
Sit down.
Hello, Don?
Yeah.
Can you come in here a minute?
- So you wanna be in pictures, huh?
- Yes.
You ever done any acting?
I played Santa Claus in a pageant back in St. Louis.
- No fooling.
- I still remember some of the words.
'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a rat.
Isn't that "mouse"?
Rat.
This pageant was in the ghetto.
Don, this gentleman here would like to work in pictures with us.
Don's our director.
What do you think?
I think we could find a place for him.
Let me see.
The harem scene.
Wouldn't he be delicious?
Yeah, yeah.
Good thinkin', Don.
Yeah, that's good thinkin', Don.
What am I supposed to do now?
Go right through that door and relax with your son and his friend.
- We'll be right with you.
- Okay.
Say, listen.
You want me to shave my beard off?
I'll shave if you want me to.
No.
You're absolutely perfect just the way you are.
I am, ain't I?
Well, look who's here?
Rock and Tab.
Oh, no.
What are you doing here?
Did you follow us?
No, the man said that he could definitely use me and that I was perfect.
And you know, that director said I was delicious.
You know, I think that director is - Rollo, come here, man.
- What?
What kind of movie can this be if they're gonna use him?
I don't know.
Maybe they just gonna use him for the crowd scene.
All right, gentlemen.
Don, let's go.
Yes.
Now, gentlemen, would you kindly undress down to your shorts?
- Yeah, sure.
- Sure.
Okay.
Did you say for us to get undressed?
Maybe it's just for our costumes, right, jack?
I'm sorry.
You haven't seen the script yet.
It's basically skeletal.
We do a lot of improvisations.
Why don't you take a look at the script yourself?
Oh, yeah, that's spiffy.
What kind of movie is this?
Ain't nobody got no clothes on.
Now you're gettin' it.
I ain't gettin' nothin' but the hell outta here.
Yeah, come on, Rollo.
Why didn't you tell us this was gonna be a nudie?
I ain't gonna be in no naked movie.
I ain't no nudie.
You're already here.
What do you got to lose?
You gonna lose about 19 of your teeth if you don't shut up!
- Come on.
- Come on, Pop.
Forget it, man.
- Just forget it.
- Hold on!
Don't anybody move!
You're all under arrest!
Wait a minute, Officer.
What's the charge?
The charge is taking part in a pornographic movie.
- What?
- Come on!
Out!
Move!
You too!
Let's go!
Oh, I feel a big one!
I'm comin' to join you, Elizabeth!
You hear that?
But shut your eyes, honey!
It's a nudie rap!
Let me outta here, you hear that?
Let me outta here!
Hey, let me outta here!
Ajailbird.
A 65-year-old jailbird.
I'll bet you they cut off my Social Security.
Relax, Pop.
Mr. Sanford, you better calm down.
Don't let this place get to you.
Pretty soon you'll be stir-crazy.
Then they'll throw you in the hole.
You mean like they did Paul Muni in I Was a Fugitive from a Chain Gang?
- That's it.
- I couldn't take that.
Hey!
Let me outta here!
I'm innocent!
I didn't do nothin'!
Let me outta here!
You just wait until Ralph Abernathy finds out about this!
- Let me outta here!
- Pop, quiet down.
- Let me out!
- Knock it off!
- I wanna get outta here.
- Say, old dude, what's wrong with you?
Why don't you cancel all this noise you're making?
Can't even hear my radio for you.
Listen, I'm a real sick man.
I got to get out so I can get to my medicine, else I'll go like this.
I mean, like this.
- So?
- "So"?
Is that all you can say?
What kind of brother are you?
You must be a West Indian.
What do you want me to do?
Let me outta here so I can make my one phone call.
What one phone call is that, old dude?
The one phone call you get to make when you get arrested.
If you'd been watching Perry Mason, you'd know what I'm talkin' about.
He's right.
We do get to make one phone call.
Okay, I'll let you make your one phone call if you be quiet.
Good.
Say, Pop, look.
I'll make the phone call, okay?
See, I was just gonna call Sparitoba.
- You know, Bubba's friend Sparitoba?
- Who's Sparitoba?
He's a part-time lawyer and deliveryman down at Leo's Barbecue.
Today is Friday, so he'll be out there delivering at Leo's Barbecue today.
Never mind, Pop.
I know who to call, okay?
- I'll be right back.
- You can say that again, jack.
Say, listen here.
Where's the men's room?
Just turn around and aim yourself in that direction.
- There?
- There.
That's it?
Yeah.
What did you think it was, a goldfish bowl?
Well it's all out in the open.
I ain't gonna never be able to use that.
I hope you don't get too long a sentence then.
Say, listen, gimme a cigarette, will you?
I ain't got any.
I thought you quit smoking anyway.
I did, but when I get upset, I gotta have me a cigarette.
Anybody here got a cigarette?
- Oh, Mr. Sanford.
- Yeah, who is that?
Over here, Mr. Sanford, in the next cell.
What you want?
I heard you asking for a cigarette, and I thought I'd offer you one.
- I don't know if these are your brand.
- Any brand is all right as long as it ain't none of that Acapulco artichoke.
This could be very disconcerting the first time around.
Sometimes you just need someone to hold your hand, so to speak.
A man could get locked up here away from loved ones and sweethearts.
It could get very lonely after a few weeks.
I'm sorry.
Here's my lighter.
Here's your cigarette and your lighter.
- What happened?
- Everything's cool.
I called Aunt Esther.
She's on the way over here.
Esther?
You called Aunt Esther up?
Now everybody in town is gonna know about this!
- Is Aunt Esther a talker?
- Is she a talker?
Her mouth's so big, you can put your head in it with your hat on.
Pop, we need Aunt Esther.
She's the one with the habeas corpus.
Yeah, she got a big one of them too.
You don't want Esther to get us out of here?
You wanna stay in here?
Maybe, if they give me a cell with a decent toilet.
Dinner is served.
This is dinner?
There's a fried bologna sandwich on toast, hot warm milk, Tootsie Roll Pops and I'll warm that up for you if you want me to.
No?
Well, bon appétit, amigos.
Why, you I can't eat this here.
I'm goin' on a hunger strike.
You hear that, City Hall?
I'm goin' on a hunger strike!
Pop!
Would you quiet down?
That's not gonna help.
I can't eat no sandwiches.
Sandwiches make me burp.
Eat your Tootsie Roll Pop, Pop.
That's good.
What a way to spend my last days sittin' between two dummies, suckin' on a Tootsie Roll Pop.
Well, here they are, ma'am.
Winkin', Blinkin' and Nod.
Aunt Esther, are we glad to see you.
Well, I'm sure not glad to see you, at least not in jail.
Why don't you shut up, Esther.
You just keep suckin' on that sucker, sucker.
And when I pull your chain, you bark.
Otherwise, don't you say nothin'.
Lamont Sanford, I'm ashamed of you.

It's gonna break her heart.
Aunt Esther, are you gonna help us get outta here?
They're checkin' it out upstairs.
Fred Sanford, I'm glad my sister isn't here to see this and see the awful stain you put on our family.
Listen, Esther, I didn't put no stain on your family.
Your family was stained when I met you-all.
- Don't you talk about my family!
- I'll talk about your family.
Every time a baby was born, they had that ugly stain on 'em.
That's right.

Even Ajax couldn't do nothin' with a stain like that.
How dare you say something like that about my family!
Why, you bean-eatin' bear hugger!

Let 'em go.
- Wait a minute.

These heathens ain't gonna stand still to listen to this.
Isaiah, chapter 42, verses 5 to 7.
Don't tell me "Thus said God the Lord, I the Lord have called you in righteousness to bring out the prisoners and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.
" I don't hear no amen in there.
Can I get an amen for chapter 42?
- Amen.
- Amen.
Let us get on outta here.
Well, all right.
Let me hear somethin' if you wanna get out.
