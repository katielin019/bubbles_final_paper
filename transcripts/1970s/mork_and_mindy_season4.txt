{START OF EPISODE 1}
Na-no, na-no.
Well, I gotta go, Mork.
Keep your fingers crossed for me.
Or whatever you Orkans do for luck.
Oh, look at all the flowers.
Mork, the room looks beautiful.
I know, Mind, and not a single Medfly in the bunch.
Oh, Mork.
- Titter, titter, blush, blush, blush.
- Oh, Mork.
Hi.
Ha, ha.
Oh, Mork, this is so sweet of you to do this for me.
But you're a little premature.
I'm not gonna know about the newscaster job till this afternoon.
But thanks.
Oh, down, boy.
Mork, down, boy, down, boy.
Mind, Mind, Mind Go ahead tell her.
No, I can't.
Oh, tell her.
Tell her.
I can't.
Oh, come on, tell her.
Oh, I'm cramping up emotionally.
Just tell her.
You can do it.
Tell her, tell her Mork, I'm gonna have to wait later.
Sorry, wait.
I'm Oh, wait.
Just tell her.
Tell her.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Mindy, you hold my three hearts in your two hands.
Basically, what I'd like to say is, will you marry me, Mind?
Mind?
The shiksa split.
Make a small mental note: It's always better to propose while she's in the room.
- Mork?
- Mind, oh, you say the magic words.
Roast.
Don't forget to put it in the oven.
Bye.
All that love for a hunk of meat.
I blew my big moment.
I was there.
I blew it.
Fore!
This is not the American embassy!
Mind if I play through?
Exidor, is that you?
That's what it says on my scorecard.
Try a five iron?
Pepe, that's why you're a caddy and I'm on the tour.
I always like playing this course.
So well-tended.
Those are for Mindy.
I tried to propose to her.
- What did she say?
- Put the roast in the oven.
So that's where it goes.
Mork, you can join me on my crusade.
I'm going to take golf from the rich and give it to the poor.
We'll play in the streets with real hazards, like gang violence and mopeds.
Exidor, you've got to help me, please.
I mean, you know everything.
I mean, you even know the color of Ronald Reagan's real hair.
Please, please, how do?
How do I propose to Mindy?
Ditch the skirt, Mork.
Yes, but I love Mindy.
Isn't marriage the ultimate commitment, the eternal bond, besides a wicked tax break?
It's a sham.
- It's a blessing.
- It's barbaric.
- It's fulfilling.
- It's a candy mint.
- It's a breath mint.
- Oh, stop.
We're both right.
Exidor, please, please, pull out your putter and drive me out of this sand trap of life into the fairway of love.
Mork, there's only two ways to propose.
B, the old-fashioned way.
You charge into her life on a fiery white stallion, toss the tomato on the back of the saddle and ride off into the sunset.
I guess the old-fashioned way is always best unless you're having a heart transplant, but Well, then you're stuck with C. - I don't mean to pry, but what's C?
- Hmm?
- C?
- Oh, C. Well, Mork, I must say that it's a boring choice, but it worked for Prince Charles.
I look a lot less like Howdy Doody than he does.
Mork.
This may shock and even nauseate you.
That's all right.
I subscribe to the National Enquirer.
Bunny, I may not be the handsomest man, or the brightest, or the wealthiest man in the world, but I've got his phone number.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
Let's see.
Did she come in yet?
Okay.
On your mark, get set, propose.
- Mindy, l - You know, sometimes I wish I was the garbage man, when they wake up in the morning, they expect the world to stink.
Mind, although we've only known each other now for 26,802 hours, I feel basically Well, I didn't get the newscaster job.
But am I bitter?
No.
Mr. Sternhagen said it had nothing to do with my being a woman, it's just that he needed a shortstop for the station's softball team.
Mind It's hard to propose to a moving target.
Mind.
- Mindy - Oh, I gotta get my mind off this.
I know, let's go do something fun.
You wanna play tennis?
- Oh, l - Or we'll do anything.
I'd love to play "Space Invaders".
Go for some pizza, maybe get married.
No, we had Italian food last night.
Cute, but not the greatest attention span.
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo, you die.
- Thanks.
- Mind, you know, I've traveled all around the galaxy, and I never thought I'd fall for an Earthling.
Oh, Mork.
You know, I don't think I know a nicer or kinder being than you.
I love you very much, and will you marry me?
Mind?
Hon, don't check out without the baggage.
Mind.
Mind.
Mind.
Little Pooter.
Heh.
Mind.
Hello, everybody.
- What's wrong with Mindy?
- I don't know, Grams.
All I did was ask her to marry me and, boom, she's got the personality of lint.
- Marry?
- Yes, sir, I think Marry my daughter?
Oh, yes, thank you for your blessing.
Blessing?
I'll give you a blessing.
Wouldn't hit a man standing behind a woman wearing glasses, would you?
Married.
You know, I think that we three should have a talk right now.
- Come on.
- Okay.
I don't think we should neglect Mindy like this.
- Honey, come on.
- Hi, Dad.
You know, Pops, wherever Mindy goes, I go, because basically we're a unit, right?
Okay, but since we're almost family, I can make one exception.
Now, honey, let me see if I can I can say this tactfully.
Mork is an alien.
He's an extraterrestrial being.
A UFO with legs.
Oh, pipe down, Fredzo.
You don't mind having that alien sit on your television so you can bring in A television antenna is one thing, a son-in-law is another.
Don't talk to me about a son-in-law.
Come on, you two.
All right.
Technically, we all know Mork isn't exactly human, but he has a lot more humanity in him than anyone I've ever met.
He's sweet, he's charming, he's sensitive, and I love him.
Uh, Mindy, you loved Oliver too, but you got over him.
Oliver was a goldfish.
And he went belly-up.
Will you talk some sense into him, please?
Oh, Mindy dear, we all love Mork.
Yes, and we don't mind if he still likes to chase cars or sit on his face, but you see, you mustn't let love spoil your judgment.
Mindy, any mixed marriage is rough.
Yes, but I'm afraid this one is impossible.
Mindy, look at the facts.
Mork can never support you.
So I'll be the breadwinner.
I want a career.
What happens to your career if he's transferred to another planet?
I'll commute.
Mindy, think.
Mork is an Orkan and he's aging backwards.
You'll be on Medicare, he'll be on pablum.
Dear, you will never be able to have a normal life.
And what about having a family?
The chances are, you can't.
Oh, Mindy, we don't like to see you cheated out of having something as precious as children.
Honey, it's your decision, and we just want you to be realistic.
And sometimes that's the hardest thing in the world.
I always thought my life would be like a Doris Day movie, not Barbarella.
How do I weigh what I feel against what I know is logical?
Honey, I think you know exactly what has to be done.
Will you folks talk a little louder?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
This is gonna be a lot harder than it was to flush Oliver down the toilet.
Mind, you've been in there all night.
Are you gonna come out?
Yes.
Yes.
She said, "Yes".
Mind, Mind, Mind.
Oh, yes, Mind, Mind, Mind, look.
Oh, Mork.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, Mork, it's a beautiful ring.
- Look at the jewels, they're sparkling.
- Uh-huh.
- They're glittering.
- Mm-hm.
- They're moving.
- Yeah.
Those are his eyes.
He's blinking.
- Him?
He's alive?
- Yep.
Oh, don't do that.
You'll give him whiplash.
See, the nice thing about it is, if you drop it, he'll follow you home.
It's a very nice ring, but I can't accept it.
You don't want the engagement ring?
- Oh, Mork.
- Mind?
It's not the ring.
See, Mork, sometimes in life, no matter how much you dream or you wish for something, it just can't be.
I guess what I'm really trying to say is, I can't marry you.
Pshaw, Mind, it's a joke, right, like the volunteer Army?
Rejection.
Okay.
You don't wanna be Mrs. Mork?
Mind, Mind, Mind, but Mind, will you give me one reason why we can't get married, bicker, and learn to play canasta for the rest of our lives?
I can't lie to you, and it really hurts me to have to say this.
- It's because you're an alien.
- And?
And?
And that's it.
Don't you see?
We're from two completely different worlds.
Oh, Mind, Mind, that never affected, like, Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier.
I mean, Pocahontas and John Smith, or Mickey Rooney and pick-a-number.
Mind, come on now.
Mind, I'm not gonna give up.
- No way, like glue, I'm stuck on you.
- Oh, come on.
Deep down inside, you know there's probably a barrier that shouldn't be crossed.
Yeah, but you said you loved me, you know, love me.
You know, L-O-V-V.
Mork, I said that and I meant it, but I'm sorry, my mind is made up.
Oh, but, Mind, you took more time to make up your mind about your bathroom wallpaper.
I mean more to you than that, don't I?
You do.
Well, just Well, just take some time, you know?
I mean, just 24 hours.
Please, Mind, Mind, Mind, please.
Please, oh, please, oh, please All right.
Tell you what, tell you what.
It's 11:59 now.
Because I like what you stand for even when you're sitting, I'll give you the extra minute and make it midnight tomorrow night.
Okay, but I can't promise anything.
- Right.
- All right.
Good night.
Good night.
Remember, you changed your mind about the wallpaper.
Mork promo, take one.
You will marry Mork.
You love Mork.
Mork loves you.
Mork is great.
He's a today kind of guy.
Lock up when you leave.
- Jake?
- Hmm?
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk.
You and I haven't had one for a long time.
We never had one.
Well, then I guess we're overdue.
See, I have this really important decision that I have to make in about two hours.
Now, logically, I know what the answer should be, but emotionally, I feel exactly the opposite.
You've been around for a while.
What do you usually do?
Do you think with your head or with your heart?
Mindy, a lot of people think of me as just old Jake the cameraman, that I care about nothing except staying in focus and going home early.
They think I don't care about anybody else's problems because nobody cares about mine.
Well, you know something?
They're right.
Never did like Old Jake.
Mork, what are you doing?
Mind, I've come to sweep you off your feet.
- Oh, my God.
- Give me your foot.
Here we go.
Ugh.
Big lunch, Mind?
This is ridiculous.
No, it's romantic.
We're gonna ride off into the sunset.
The sun set four hours ago.
I guess we better haul it then.
- Mork - Mind, Mind, Mind.
Mork!
That's all right, Mind.
I'll catch the next one.
Well, you really topped yourself that time, Mork.
Yeah, I guess you've never ridden a pony through a car wash before, huh?
Boy, he scampered when he hit that hot wax.
You haven't had a date like that with an earthman.
You're right there.
Mork, it's almost midnight.
I think we should sit down and talk.
Mind, there's enough time for the grand finale.
Oh, Mork, you don't need a finale.
Oh, I sure do, and you'll love this.
Put the tape in the tape recorder down there, please.
- This one marked Last Ditch Effort?
- That's it.
Oh, Mork, you've given me flowers and perfume and horses.
What's left?
Broadway!
Hit it, Mind.
Got my top hat Got my vest pressed All I need now is the girl Got my striped tie Got my hopes high Got the time and the place And I've got rhythm All I need now is the girl to go with Hey.
Hey, ho.
Boy, they really screwed this game up when they added the ball, Mind.
- Oh, no, Mork.
- Mind.
You see this guy This guy's in love with you Seriously, where are you from?
Yes, I'm in love What do I do to make you mine?
You know it.
Tell me now Is it so?
Don't let me be the last to know Because I want to be happy But I won't be happy Till I make you happy too Oh, no, Mindy, no.
Life's really worth living When you are mirth givin' Why can't I give some to you?
You know it's true, baby.
Oh, Mork.
Did I close out of town?
Oh, Mork.
Before I met you, the biggest choice I had to make in my life was whether to have my hair permed or fix the cat.
This is the hardest decision I've ever had to make.
Maybe the decision's been made for you, Mind.
I mean, think about it.
I crossed five galaxies, came to this little tiny planet and out of all those people in the world, you found me and we fell in love.
Coincidence?
I say nay.
Maybe some infinite intelligence in this cosmos as we peer out, realizes that we were meant to be married and all mankind.
I wish I could believe that.
I wish you could believe that too, Mind.
I'll send by Exidor to pick up my clothes.
Why?
You don't have to go.
I don't want you to go.
You could go, but the lease is in your name.
Just because we can't be married doesn't mean we have to end our relationship.
I mean, why can't we just go on being the way we are?
I love you.
I couldn't stay here knowing that you'll never be mine.
But it doesn't have to be like that.
If it were the other way around, could you stay?
No.
Well, big kiss.
I know how easily you run down, so don't skip breakfast.
And don't forget to take your Femiron.
- Mork.
- Yeah?
Goodbye.
Mork.
You don't want me to go, do you?
You can read minds too?
No, but I can read your face.
Oh, Mork, if I married you, I'd be giving up any chance I might have to have a normal life.
But if I lost you - Will you marry me?
- What?
Will you marry me?
This is so sudden.
I'll need some time.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Your Battle of the Bulgeness.
- Mork.
- Sir.
Do you always have to report when I'm eating?
Well, sir, I could wait, but the Earth's sun does have a limited lifespan.
After that comment, you'd better have an interesting report.
Well, sir, you're gonna decorate me for this one.
You see, Mindy and I have signed up for a full lifetime term in the most noble of all institutions, marriage.
What?
Sir?
Do I detect a note of jealousy or are you coughing on a bone?
Mork, no Orkan has entered into a marriage since our dark ages.
You've broken one of our most fundamental Orkan laws.
Correct the matter at once.
All right, sir.
I'll correct the problem.
I quit.
I abdicate my post for the woman I love.
Mork, you can't abdicate.
I'm giving you an order.
- Carry it out or else.
- Oh, yeah?
I'm marrying Mindy and you just try and stop me.
That's a nice try there, sir.
Don't you understand though?
On Earth when man and woman love each other - Silence!
- Sir.
The matter is closed.
Until next week, Mork.
Na-no.
Yeah, all right.
Uh-huh.
The old silent treatment, eh?
I am staying right on this spot until you let me marry Mindy.
I have patience.
I can wait.
I once sat through an entire Bobby Vinton concert.
Right.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Na-no, na-no.
Here, Grandma.
Put this on your forehead.
No, dear.
I'm feeling better now.
All I want is a glass of water and a small Scotch.
It's 9:00 in the morning.
I'm not gonna serve you Scotch.
Yes, yes.
You're right, dear.
You're right.
Got any tequila?
Oh, Mindy, I'll be all right.
It's just that I was so shocked at your changing your mind and deciding to marry Mork.
But, dear, if that is what you want, then we are going to give you a most beautiful wedding.
Well, thanks, Grandma.
I just want a small wedding.
You know, just family.
Mm-hm.
Uh, you're gonna stay around while I break the news to Dad, aren't you?
No.
No, no, no.
You don't need me.
Your father is a kind, loving, compassionate man.
And, uh, he'll understand.
Well, that helps.
Besides, I don't wanna be here when he freaks.
I feel like a hamster without a wheel.
I mean, I feel like a scuff mark on the loafer of life.
Would you mind if I broke every dish?
No!
Don't break my dishes.
- What about this tacky lamp then?
- Mork.
- What happened to nonviolence?
- Mind, wake up.
The '60s are over.
Mork, why are you carrying on like this?
It's really no big deal, except Orson forbids us to get married.
Oh, he does, does he?
Since when can Orson tell us whether we can get married or not?
Since 2 million years ago when they outlawed marriage on Ork.
Well, I hope you told him it's legal here on Earth.
You bet.
- Then what happened?
- He lit me up like Times Square.
Aah!
Oh, baby, what's happening?
You know, things like that, Mind.
Mork, you just can't accept his decision.
That really makes me mad.
We're getting married.
We don't have to get anyone's permission.
- Hi, everybody.
- Permission for what?
Oh, uh, to tear the tags off the pillows.
Ah.
Why don't you sit down?
And I'll fix you a nice breakfast.
- Eggs, Danish - Son-in-law.
I'll have a Danish.
A son-in-law?
Yeah.
It's not exactly the way I had planned to break it to you.
But, uh, yeah, uh, Mork and I have decided to get married.
Over my dead body.
That'll trip us, Pop, but it won't stop us.
Fred, that's terrible.
Oh, Mindy.
I'm so happy for you and Mork.
You know what?
I wanna throw you a shower.
No, no.
No happy and no shower.
Mindy, I can't believe after our discussion that you would turn around and do anything this Stupid?
- Thank you, Mork.
- You got it.
Now, get out of her life.
Dad, this isn't your orchestra.
You just can't wave your baton and tell us what to do.
Fred, pumpkin, why are you so against their getting married?
It's obvious they're in love.
Cathy, sweet potato, I know what I'm doing.
Heh.
Fred, poodle, that's what you said just before you put the garage door on backwards.
Look, Cathy, angel face, trust me.
They can't get married because Mork is from Uh He Uh, they're from two different worlds.
Fred, there's no reason for us to get upset.
I understand this is a talk between you and your daughter.
I'll go run some errands.
You two discuss it calmly, and I'll abide by your decision.
Mindy, the shower is Saturday.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, idiot moi.
Hey, obviously you and your dad, like, need some space here, okay?
And, uh, who am I to intrude upon your privacy?
That's what makes me different from Allen Funt.
I'll just be up here knitting a Volkswagen.
Upstairs.
Remember Broadway?
Have great rhythm Now, look, Mindy, let's just get one thing straight here.
Yes, Dad, lets.
Look, I love you very much and we sure would like to have your blessing.
But we don't need anyone's permission to get married.
You know something, Mindy?
You were a stubborn little girl and you've grown into a stubborn woman.
But I'll tell you something.
You've got a lot of You got a lot of moxie.
As a matter of fact, I'd really be proud of you if you weren't making such a tragic mistake.
Okay, Dad.
I'm sorry you feel that way.
This is gonna hurt me more than anything I've had to do before, but if I have to, I'll walk down that aisle alone.
You will over my dead body.
You have my blessing.
Thank you, soft touch.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Oh, mon cher Papa!
Oh, I love tweed.
I love I'm gonna be your son-in-law, and you can just call me Meathead.
You can count on it.
I better get back and turn that garage door around or Cathy will never forgive me.
What have I done?
Well, Mork, I've taken care of my half of the galaxy.
The rest is up to you.
You've gotta talk to Orson.
Mm-mm.
Oh.
No, no, Mind.
No way I'm gonna go one on one with the big O. If you deal with Orson the way I just dealt with my father, you can get him to change his mind.
Mind, I'd rather join the Libyan Air Force.
Look, Mork, come on.
You just gotta confront Orson.
- And you've gotta do it right away.
- Mind.
Look, Mork, our future is in your hands.
Oh.
You're right, Mind.
We have an industrial-strength love.
I'm gonna stand up to him!
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, your Winnebagoship.
Be nice.
Come on, Mind.
Ors and I go back a long way.
He was my Little League coach and the team bus.
Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
Come on out.
Show your face.
No one here?
Well, it's always cheaper to call after 11 anyway.
What do you want, Mork?
I'm in a hurry.
I was just on my way to the Intergalactic Wine and Cheese Festival.
Well, sir, this will only take a second.
Remember what you said when I asked if I could marry the marvelous, mercurial Midwestern Mindy?
Yes.
I said no Orkan shall enter into marriage, especially to a lower life-form, one that still chews their food.
I was hoping you'd forgotten, sir, but I never really wanted to challenge your authority, and I hate to pooh-pooh your will, but there is nothing that you can do to stop me from marrying Mindy.
In that case, I'm going to miss our little chats.
Heh.
Oh, just kidding, sir.
You know, I don't know what gets into my head sometimes.
You know, I don't really need to marry Mindy.
Besides, her cooking tastes like insulation.
I'm glad to hear you say that, Mork.
But just remember, if you defy me, a hideous fate will befall you.
For example?
I will alter your molecular structure into a life-form that will be more obedient.
Oh, ho.
You want obedience?
Obedience are us.
You say jump, I say how high?
You say run, I say how fast?
You say "Camptown," I say "doo-dah".
I've heard enough, Mork.
Hold your tongue.
Yes, sir.
You've got it.
Did I startle you?
Not as much as if you'd been Ethel Merman, but What happened?
You told Orson, right?
You confronted him and told him that we were gonna be married?
Well He backed down, right?
Because you're strong and brave with the courage of your convictions.
Well And no force exists that can prevent us from being married, right, Mork?
Well, those were my words exactly, Mind.
Um, you know, I told him I I really let him have it.
I leveled him.
- You did?
- I made him feel lower than the price of pork in Tel Aviv.
Let's just break out the champagne right now.
Let's celebrate.
Let's pop our corks.
The shampoo is champagne!
You're kidding, Mork?
We're really getting married?
- Oh, yes.
- Aah!
I can't believe it!
I'm so proud of you.
Mork has committed a flagrant violation of Orkan law.
He will be severely punished.
- This is the big day.
- Yeah.
You want me to help you with that?
No, I can get it.
I'm not one of those nervous brides-to-be.
Right.
Honey.
Honey, take it easy.
Oh, honey, come on, sweetie.
Come on, sit down, sit down, sit down.
All right, now just take it easy, honey, and relax.
Here, I have something for you.
I gave this to your mother on our wedding day, and I know she'd want you to have it.
Oh, Dad, her gold four-leaf clover.
Yeah.
I hope Mork doesn't replant it.
It always brought us a lot of luck.
Look who we got as a daughter.
Aw, Dad, it's beautiful.
Thanks.
And thanks for always being there when I needed you.
And I always will be.
- Just like that.
- Just like that.
Well, I guess I'd better get to the chapel.
Just think, in a little while you'll be Mrs. Mindy Mork doesn't have a last name.
Uh, what are you gonna call yourselves?
Well, we've been talking about last names.
He's torn between Travolta and Pittsburgh.
But I think I can talk him into McConnell or Phoenix.
Work on Phoenix.
I'll see you there.
Mork, we'd better get going.
What are you doing in there?
Oh, I'm just trying to work on my hair to achieve that John Davidson look.
You can do that at the church.
We really should have been there five minutes ago.
Okay, you're right.
We don't wanna be late, do we?
There'd be 100 rabid bingo fans out there eating our smorgasbord.
Can you give me a hand with the, uh Ah!
Oh, yeah, you're probably gonna need some help with that, won't you?
What is that?
What?
Oh, this.
Oh, it's my morning coat.
Remember the guy with the accent and the pins in his mouth.
- No!
I'm talking about the hair!
- Mind, I told you I was working on it.
Not just the hair, the ears and the nose.
Oh, that.
Well, Orson's just turning me into a dog.
Come on, let's go.
Orson's turning you into a dog?
Yeah.
You'll have to drive, Mind.
I wanna stick my head out the window.
Orson's turning you into a dog?
Um, yup.
Level time, isn't it?
Well, Mind, um, I lied to you.
He really didn't give his permission for me to marry you.
I made my bed, now I have to lie in it, if I'm still allowed on the furniture.
Mork, we are getting married in one hour.
This is no time for jokes.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
LBJ!
LBJ!
- They're real!
- Of course, Mind.
You don't get this kind of quality from a novelty shop.
I can't believe it.
This is happening.
This is really happening!
Mork, we gotta do something.
What can we do?
Well, I'm doing it right now, Mind.
Listen, I'm using all my will to reverse the process.
It's simply a case of mind over matter.
Listen, we're gonna have the wedding just as planned.
I mean, he can't turn me into a dog.
Telegram for Mindy McConnell.
Stop it.
Sit!
Sit!
Leave them in the hall.
Oh, Mork, it's getting worse.
Your hair's getting longer and you were barking.
I was?
Oh, Mork, I think you're losing control of this.
I think you're losing the battle.
Look at it this way, Mind.
It might be just a bad cough.
Could be worse.
He might have turned me into a blowfish or a Stridex pad or a lounge singer.
Mork, come on, you've gotta fight.
Try and stand up like a human.
I can't, Mind, but I can do this.
How could Orson do this to us?
Quick, Mork, we've gotta call him.
Plug me into your mind with you and I'll talk him into changing you back.
Off!
What you have to do is stick your finger in my ear and with your other hand scratch my head.
- I didn't have to do that the last time.
- But it sure will make me happy.
Just call him.
Mork calling Orson, come in.
Mork calling Orson, come in.
Where is Orson?
How can he keep us on hold like this?
Call him again, Mork.
I guess I'm in this by myself.
Mindy calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Where are you?
This is an emergency!
I'm here, Earthling.
What's the problem?
Don't they allow pets in your building?
Down, boy.
Mork, sit!
Out!
Out!
Ah, you've kept his name.
I thought Scruffy would be more appropriate.
How can you be so cruel?
You've stripped him of his dignity!
You just can't go around turning people into Mork, I'm trying to make a point.
Fetch, Mork!
I called the house.
They don't answer.
I called the police, the hospitals.
Nothing.
They were behind me when I left them.
I don't know what happened.
Oh, dear, I'm getting worried.
That's gotta be Mork.
Nobody knocks on a church door.
It's about time you answered.
I was getting a headache.
- Was he invited?
- Unfortunately he's the best man.
I would have been here sooner, but it's a little tough hitchhiking in this outfit.
Interesting jacket.
It's a suit.
I lost the pants crawling over the wall.
Excuse me, did you see Mork and Mindy when you came in?
Not unless they're wearing little red jackets and parking cars.
You mean they're not here yet?
Well, lucky for you I'm an emcee.
You were about to lose your crowd.
Dear friends we are gathered here in this house of worship, just two blocks south of the House of Pies.
And speaking of pies, would someone please explain to me what is meant by Black Forest cake?
Where is the Black Forest?
Do they have cakes hanging from trees in the Black Forest?
But most important, Padre, whatever happened to Forrest Tucker?
Orson, I'm pleading with you.
How can you do this?
If you give Mork back to me, he'll show you the values of being human.
If I had emotions, I'd probably be very touched right now.
Then you're not gonna change him back?
He broke the law.
Orson, we came here Mork.
Mork?
Here boy!
All right, Orson.
I just want you to know one thing.
You may have changed Mork physically, but underneath all this fur, he's still Mork.
He risked everything for me so we could be married, and your little punishment isn't gonna change my plans.
I still love him and I'm going through with this ceremony.
You're going to marry a dog?
No, I'm marrying Mork.
We'll see, but she sure is a spunky little alien.
If you're not busy after the reception, would you like to catch a white sale?
- I don't think so.
- I see.
How about washing my hair?
Where's the groom?
Who invited a dog?
Phillipe, you're not supposed to be here.
You're supposed to be home taping the Ram game.
Oh, forget it.
Sit in the pew.
Hello.
Uncle Ernie, you're out on parole, good to see you.
Aunt Tilly, bleached your mustache.
Wonderful.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in the holy bond of matrimony.
Be there anyone here who opposes this union, let them speak now or forever remain silent.
Phew.
The rings, please.
Psst.
The rings.
Talk to one another.
I'll be right with you.
I hope your next wedding's casual.
And now, instead of reciting the traditional vows, Mork and Mindy have a few words to say to one another.
Mindy.
Mork, when you entered my life, you brought me happiness, joy and laughter.
My love for you transcends time and space.
Grow with me, the best is yet to be.
Mind, you're my friend, my love, you're my life.
Supposed to be more but the lady in the card shop said, "Buy or get out".
I don't know the right words.
Besides, I don't think there are enough to describe how I really feel about you.
"Love" is a small word but I think it covers so much.
I love you.
By the power vested in me, by the state of Colorado, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Welcome to my world, Mrs. Pittsburgh.
I can't believe it.
We really got married.
Just think, Mork.
In 24 hours, we'll be on a plane to Acapulco.
Oh, Acapulco is tres passé, Mind, that's for bottled water salesmen.
We're gonna spend 25 days and one beautiful night on Ork.
Ork?
Mind, Mind, Mind I've never been in outer space before.
Will I even be able to breathe on Ork?
Beats me, Mind, but we'll find out.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Na-no, na-no.
This has been a day to remember.
Mindy was such a beautiful bride.
But, Cora, they're honeymooning on Ork.
Why can't they go to the Poconos?
Well, I think it's exciting to go to another planet.
And I'd rather have a frontal lobotomy.
Well, go for it.
- Hello.
- Hey.
Hi.
It's almost time to blast off.
Oh, Mindy, honey, won't you reconsider?
I mean, we're talking about space travel here.
Going off to some strange planet.
Oh, Dad, it's where Mork grew up.
He just wants to share it with me.
Yeah, well, couldn't you just thumb through his yearbook?
Dad, I'm a journalist.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
To boldly go where no man has gone.
I mean, I'm thrilled.
I mean, I'm exhilarated.
I'm scared to death.
Boy, that's a catchy tune.
I just wish I could remember the words.
Are those special glasses to shield our eyes from the ultraviolet rays?
No, no, Mind.
I just bought them because they're gnarly.
Yeah, that's great, Mork.
Are you crazy?
You can't let this man pilot you millions of miles through space.
He doesn't even have a driver's license.
Oh, come on now, Pops, come on now.
I've been to the four corners of the universe, I've charted 16 solar systems, and I can refold a road map correctly.
Well, there's another thing, Mork.
Mindy doesn't travel all that well.
- She got sick in her baby carriage.
- Aw.
Oh, that little "neener pooter".
Don't worry about her.
We're gonna be traveling first class.
It's here, Mindy.
Oh, boy.
Boy, we're gonna go in style!
We're gonna go Oh, shazbot.
They sent the compact model.
Oh, well, we'll just have to make do.
Now, now, now, just a minute, Mork.
The words "deep space" and "make do" don't go together.
Oh, mon papa, ma familia, don't you worry about a thing.
I have prepared for everything that can be planned.
I've packed plenty of Dramamine and Tang.
Has anyone seen my Dramamine and Tang?
Uh, I packed it.
My wife.
I think I'll keep her.
I packed a lunch for you.
And there's a piece of your wedding cake in there too.
Oh, thanks, Grandma.
And we'll both bring you back something from Ork.
Where are you going to stay up there?
We're going first class.
We're staying at the Hotel And Spa.
- You have reservations?
- No, it seems like a nice place.
Well, just remember, Mork.
That's pretty valuable cargo there.
Oh, you're right.
I really am proud of this suitcase.
He meant me.
Oh.
Don't you worry.
Your little girl is in very good hands.
Don't touch that!
You'll kill us all!
Good evening and welcome to Air Ork's intergalactic traveler, the Huevos Grande.
Now that we're in flight, be aware of the total lack of safety measures.
First of all, we have no exits, either front, back or side.
In case of emergency, a brown paper bag will fall from the ceiling, - which means absolutely nothing.
- Heh.
On this flight, our in-flight movie will be The High and the Mighty and Fate is a Lonely Hunter.
Airport '7ç.
Okay.
My turn.
I spy with my little eye something starting with the letter J. I spy the planet Jupiter.
Ha, ha.
- Very good.
- That's hard to miss.
It's so huge.
Okay, I spy with my little eye something beginning with the letter K. K. I see a meteor coming right at us.
- You're supposed to say, "I spy," not - No!
Besides, meteor begins with M Yeah, it's a Meteor!
Mind, Mind, wake up.
Look on the scanner.
We're here.
- Oh, Mork.
Ork is beautiful.
- Well, yeah.
Just think, me, Mindy McConnell, the first woman in space.
Well, you're not the first one.
There was a Russian lady, but you're the first one that shaves her legs.
Aren't we going awfully fast?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, Mind, isn't it a kick?
Oh, there's the city now.
I better slow down.
Pity.
Welcoming you to Squelm in the Elm Memorial Airport.
There will be a brief delay due to the controllers' strike.
Don't stand up until we're completely docked at the gate.
And observe the "No Screaming" signs.
- Oh, Mork, Ork is just amazing.
- I know, Mind.
Look at this hotel.
Everything is just so futuristic.
This is one of the old downtown hotels, Mind.
You should see the ones on the Strip.
Boy, Kenahara.
What are we gonna do first?
I just wanna do everything.
We'll go see my old neighborhood, if you don't mind digging with your hands.
What?
Ha, ha.
Oh.
Na-no.
Ha, ha.
Oh.
Oh.
Na-no.
What's?
What's that all about?
Oh, that's our version of the National Enquirer, Mind.
Here you'll be a celebrity, because they've never seen an Earthling before.
There's gonna be a little giggling and gawking.
Like an Alexander Haig press conference.
Na-no.
I suddenly feel very tired and very out of place.
- Let's go to our room.
- All right.
- What did you say?
- I said you weren't that contagious.
And also I said you were housebroken too.
May I help you?
Uh, yes.
We have reservations under the name of Mork.
Mind, why are you talking to him?
He asked about our reservations.
Mind, that's a penguin.
They don't talk.
They hardly ever take reservations.
Yes, Mork.
And this must be your wife, the Earthling.
Well, it takes all kinds.
Orlando, this is taken care of through, uh, Orson's office.
We'd like the special room overlooking the ice machine.
The room won't be ready for 30 micro-bleems.
Na-no, na-no.
Doesn't he look amazingly like Elton John, Mind?
Mork, Orson carries a lot of weight around here.
Couldn't we get him to lean on the snippy little guy?
Listen, I'm your husband.
I don't need Orson's weight.
I have a lot of clout around here.
I used to be the dinner diver in the lobster tank.
If that penguin gives you any trouble, wait right here.
Okay, I'll just browse.
Hello.
Why do I feel like the Elephant Man?
Excuse me.
On Earth we don't poke people we don't date.
Okay, that's enough.
No more poking.
Mork.
Oh, no, officers, they didn't mean any harm.
I'm sure they've just never Wait a minute!
Mork!
Wait.
I'm an American.
Help!
Mork!
Help!
Mind?
Mind, I've arranged for the room, hon.
Peekaboo.
Hope she didn't go in the pool.
It hasn't eaten yet today.
Hello, police?
My wife is missing.
She's an Earthling.
Yeah, she'll be the only one who knows who Claude Akins is.
Oh, never mind.
Thank you anyway.
Mind.
Mind.
- Oh, Mork.
- Oh, Mind.
Hope you're all right.
Oh, Mork, I was dragged out of here by the space cadets.
And taken someplace for this physical examination.
Oh, they paraded me around and asked me questions I didn't understand and gave me this.
I guess it's some sort of a visa or something.
That wasn't a customs office.
That was a pet show.
What?
You didn't do too badly.
You took fourth place.
A pet show?
Oh, I'm so humiliated.
Oh, Mind, I know.
You should have at least won in the obedience class.
Oh, Mind, I don't know what to Thank you.
Oh, Mind, I'm really sorry about that.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to make the honeymoon very, very special.
Oh, Mork, no, it's not your fault.
It's just been such a long trip.
And And our rooms weren't ready.
In fourth place.
Mind!
Mind.
I went to school with his father.
I just need some rest.
Let's go to our room.
I admit I love your attitude.
You're hanging in there with me.
No wonder they call you the better half.
Now the room's all set to go and let's go upstairs and we'll play newlyweds, you know, count our savings bonds.
This is an intergalactic class hotel.
They modify each room to satisfy the needs of the specific alien.
It's gonna be like any Ramada Inn on Earth, right down to the little paper sash on the commode.
Mork, it's customary to be carried over the threshold.
Oh, all right, Mind, but I'm a little heavy.
Me, not you.
Thanks, Mork, that was real romantic.
Well, Mind, this is just like any room on Earth.
I mean, lots of rooms I've seen on Earth with floor paper and wall rugs.
- Ceiling chairs.
- Mork.
All right, Mind, they screwed it up!
I'm sorry!
It looks like it was decorated by Fools-R-Us.
Oh, Mind, how could they do this to me?
Oh!
Too much coffee, Tom?
- Mork, it's all right.
- Oh, it is?
No, but you're distraught.
We'll talk about it later.
Oh, Mind, Mind.
I just wanted our honeymoon to be very, very special.
Oh, I know.
Look, the important thing is that we're together, and it is our honeymoon.
Aw.
In the dictionary it says, "Compassionate, see you".
- I love you, Mork.
- I love you, Mind.
- Dong-ding?
- Dong-ding?
They can even screw up a doorbell.
Oh, maybe it's the bellhops with our luggage.
- Do you tip bellhops here on Ork?
- No.
They're robots.
If you tip them, they can't get back on their feet.
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
Oh, gosh, Mind!
It's the Peevee clones, Six and Seven.
- It's nice to meet you.
- You must be Mindy, his wife.
Whatever that is.
We heard you were back.
We could hardly wait to get up here.
Six thought it'd be funny if we brought in your luggage.
Yeah, we had to tip the robot.
He's still out there.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he's out there.
His little feet just flailing away.
Mind, the clones and I, we go way back.
Remember?
Rick 'em, rack 'em, ruck 'em, ruck 'em, get that ball and really fight!
We used to sneak into the school bathroom and tell, like, jokes, and l Well, you know, I got caught for being funny, and that's why I was sent to Earth.
Wait till you hear our latest Orson joke.
This is really gonna shorten your circuits.
Okay, now, watch those sides.
Here goes.
Orson is a big - Fatso!
- Fatso!
I can see why you were the only one caught.
We might as well make ourselves at home.
Might as well.
We've got a lot of catching up for Mork to do.
Hey, Mork, your human friend is really going to appreciate this one.
How many Earthlings does it take to screw in a light bulb?
I don't know.
How many Earthlings does it take to screw in a light bulb?
- One.
- One.
They're gone, Mind.
Mork, I've had colds that didn't hang on as long as the Peevee clones.
I thought they'd take the hint when we put on our nightgowns.
I thought they'd take the hint when we told them to get out.
Especially after they referred to me as "your creature".
Well I guess we're alone now.
I guess so.
Just the two of us, huh?
Yep.
Looks that way.
- On our honeymoon night.
- Yep.
Sure is dark.
Sure is.
Well, it's our wedding night.
I'd better not put this off any longer, huh?
Guess not.
Bette Davis eyes Night, Mind.
What was that?
That's the ancient Orkan honeymoon ritual.
Good night, Mind.
The honeymoon ritual is a little different on Earth.
What's different, Mind?
No mask?
Hardly.
My father gave me this marriage manual to give to you.
I told him he was crazy.
That's one for Dad.
- Read this.
- Now?
Please.
Cute pictures.
Just read, Mork.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.
Whoa.
Heh.
Okay, all done.
Is there anything you don't understand?
No, clear as a bell, Mind.
L I'm just gonna step in the bathroom for just a minute.
Mork.
Mork, are you all right?
- Did that book upset you?
- No!
Not at all.
Really, Mind.
I'm just gonna sleep on the bathroom floor tonight and maybe forever.
That's ridiculous.
You're not gonna sleep in the bathroom.
Now, come out here.
I wanna talk to you.
No way, Jose.
No chance, Lance.
Not tonight, Irving, I have a headache!
Mork, you're my husband.
I'm not gonna let you sleep in the bathroom.
If you don't come out, I'll come in there and get you.
Aha!
I'll lock the door.
Stupid Orkans forgot to put a lock on the door!
They probably didn't think we'd need one.
Now, come on, Mork, come out of there.
Mork.
Mork?
All right, I'm coming in there.
Mork!
Mork, come back.
Don't run away.
Mork.
We should have gone to Niagara Falls.
Mork.
Mork, where are you?
I know you're here someplace.
Mork, this is our honeymoon.
Is this really the way you wanna start out our marriage?
Mork not here right now!
Mork, will you come out here, please?
I need to talk to you.
I can't, Mind Oh, he can't!
Mork.
Mind.
You knew it was me all along, didn't you?
Psychic.
Well, I wasn't really running away.
I just like to hyperventilate alone.
You know, Mork, I think I realize for the first time how you must feel on Earth.
- I don't know how you cope.
- I've got you to take care of me.
Aw.
I haven't told you this, but, you know, I think Ork is really a lovely planet.
I mean, the three moons are very romantic.
Mm-hm.
And this garden, it's It's beautiful.
Look, these flowers look almost exactly like Earth roses.
They should look exactly like Earth roses.
I've been sending them here for three years now.
You see, I wanted to share a little bit of Earth's beauty with Ork.
Oh, Mork, you never told me that.
That's so nice.
They're not as beautiful as you are, though.
Oh, thanks.
Now, you wanna tell me what's bothering you?
I'm scared.
Oh, Mork.
Come over here.
Oh, Mork, everyone's scared of getting married.
It's a new experience.
It's a normal emotion.
- It is?
- Sure.
Oh, Mork, just think, someday we might have children and I'm scared to death of that.
But I know that you'll be there to help me get through it.
See, that's the really wonderful thing about marriage, is you have a friend who loves you and a partner who helps you through the rough times.
This friend and partner isn't ashamed of the other friend and partner?
No, not if they love each other.
- Oh, trouble, Mind.
- For picking a rose?
Yeah, we better walk fast.
This is a national monument, Mind.
Picking that rose would be the same on Earth as if you plucked one of Brooke Shields' eyebrows.
Back in the room again, huh?
- Looks that way.
- Yeah, looks that way.
Well, back in the room again.
Heh.
Sounds like a Willie Nelson song.
Well, um, wanna watch a little TV, Mind?
Orson Knows Best is on.
No, Mork, I'd rather talk.
You know, Mork, until today, I never really realized what it's like to be a stranger on a strange planet.
But as bizarre and as scary as Ork has been to me, at least I've been here with you.
Yeah, you got it there, kid.
It's just you and me, sweetheart.
Guess again.
- They're back.
- No, no.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
That was Peevee clones Six and Seven.
These are One and Two, the originals.
Do you wanna hear our latest Orson joke?
Mind, you think Six and Seven are funny, these clones wrote the book.
Okay, now, hold onto those sides.
Here goes.
Orson is a big Fatso.
- Mork.
- Fatso!
- You didn't laugh the first time.
- I know, Mind, but I just got it.
Oh, honey, your delivery's incredible.
"Fatso".
Just the way you said "fatso".
- She's funny.
- She's funny.
You think she's funny, wait till you read this.
Ha, ha.
Check that one out for a week, and let me know when you figure it out.
Check that one out.
Rick 'em, rack 'em, ruck 'em, ruck 'em, get that ball and really fight!
- They're gone.
- They're gone.
- Here we are in the room again.
- Yeah.
- Just the two of us.
- Looks that way.
I just want you to know I think I understand your Earth customs.
- You do?
- Yeah, and I really do care.
Oh, Mork.
Just one thing.
Would you wear the chicken head tonight?
- You're doing great, Mind.
- Thanks.
- Just stay in your lane.
- Okay.
We should really send Orson a nice thank you note.
- Yeah.
- Because I had a great time.
Oh, me too.
Mork!
You know what my favorite part was?
- What?
- Guess.
- The pillow fight?
- No.
Yeah, well No, my favorite part was My favorite part was waking up in the morning and seeing you laying there next to me and knowing for the rest of my life your face will be the first one I wake up to every morning.
Oh, ditto, Mind.
- And I've got one thing to say to you.
- What?
Meteor!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Na-no, na-no.
I feel so nauseous.
Oh, my stomach feels like cat drool on a dog lip.
Yes, this seltzer shall be the eraser on the blackboard of life.
It shall help.
Why am I talking like a character in a Tennessee Williams' play?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
Here.
Here I go.
Wow, what a head rush!
For sure.
Oh, more tiny bubbles than a Don Ho medley.
Morning.
Little hugger squash.
- Happy one-month anniversary to you.
- Oh.
What do you give someone for their one-month anniversary?
Styrofoam.
That's why I bought you a boogie board.
That's romantic.
Well, I have a little surprise for you.
The Hammond family is doing a TV special in Boulder, and I'll cover the dress rehearsal.
I thought you might wanna come with me.
The Hammond family?
Oh, Mind, the All-American Hammonds?
Oh, Mind.
I especially love Donna and Mario.
They're my favorite.
Oh, Mind, that's wonderful.
That Pass.
Pass?
But, Mork, it's our anniversary.
I mean, I know, but I've got millions of things to do, and I have to send a condolence card to Morris, the cat's mother.
At least come down and have lunch with me.
I said I was busy!
- Whoa.
Aren't we snippy today.
- Mind, I'm sorry.
You know how I get before the opening of trout season.
We'll have a lovely dinner tonight, won't we, hon?
Maybe?
- Okay, I accept your apology.
- Aw.
I gotta run.
Well, I'll see you after work.
Bye.
- Big kiss.
Bye.
- Bye, little "pooter".
Oh, what a performance.
My stomach feels like it has a Greek Orthodox wedding going on in it.
Doctor, is that you?
Patient!
Is that you?
Mork, I'm glad you called.
I don't ordinarily make house calls.
I had to make an exception in this case.
I don't have an office.
Exidor, I don't feel very well.
I'm Go no further.
First I need you to sign this waiver.
It clears me of any wrongdoing in the event of death or permanent disability resulting from my total ignorance of the medical profession.
But you're a doctor.
The only reason I became a doctor was to get MD plates, so I could park in front of Bloomingdale's.
Oh, moment, open your mouth wide.
Nurse Ryan, will you come in, please?
What are you gawking at?
Haven't you ever seen a naked man before?
Hmm.
Three fifteen, that's a tad high, Mork.
It'd be perfect if I were a rump roast.
Exidor, do something just as long as I don't have to have anything shaved.
Relax.
You better turn your head.
This might hurt a little.
Damn, I'm good!
Exidor, I feel strange and wonderful.
I feel kind of achy and I mean I have cravings for, like, Teflon bananas.
I feel kind of queasy and short-tempered!
What is it?
What is it?
Well, either you're turning into Billy Martin, or you're pregnant.
- That's - That's That's it.
I'm preggers.
I've got a bun in the oven.
Nonsense!
And that's me saying it.
Wait, wait.
No, no, no!
You don't understand.
You really don't understand.
You see, I think I really am pregnant.
I could be pregnant.
You see, an Orkan and an Earthling have never mated before.
It's possible.
You know, if it is, it's a miracle.
Every patient thinks that their case is special.
All right, come into my consultation room.
We'll talk it over.
Just sit here.
I feel so weak in the knees.
Mork I'm pregnant, I'm really pregnant.
Oh, I can't wait to tell Mindy and Omni magazine.
Mork, as your personal physician and doubles partner, I suggest that you break it to your wife gently.
And work on that serve.
Oh.
I just felt a sharp pain, Exidor.
Another one too.
What does it mean?
Well, it means you're in labor and I'm playing singles.
My little bundle of joy.
Oh, look.
My little bundle's here.
Oh, say hello to the world.
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl.
We won't know till it hatches.
Oh, that's wonderful.
And look, I have a navel.
That's wonderful.
And no stretch marks either.
Hello, little "nooter".
I'm a mother, and I'm gonna give you everything except an Oedipus complex.
And I can read Harlequin books now, and stay up all night for no reason.
Yay!
Come on now.
Smile.
Say, "Cheez Whiz".
There you go.
A picture of you and mom.
Oh, boy, Mindy is really gonna love you.
That is, if I get up the nerve to tell her that you were born.
- Hi, Mork, I'm home.
- Nap time.
Here we go.
Hi.
Well, I've got this great idea.
How to make our one-month anniversary even better than our three-week anniversary.
Wanna hear it?
You can't really top Andy Warhol's 3D Hamlet.
"Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I." Interesting.
Well, we're gonna get all dressed up, and we're gonna go out and do something we've never done before.
That's fine.
Put on your prom dress and I'll put on my Mr. Peanut outfit.
Then we can have a very candid, sober discussion about family.
Oh, Mork, I wanna go out and do something romantic.
Like, I wanna go ride the carousel, or I know.
Let's put on warm clothes, go out and make angels in the snow like in Love Story.
The sad thing about that movie was that she became an angel before she ever had a family.
You know what's making a big romantic comeback?
- The family unit.
- Don't talk to me about family units.
I just spent the whole day with the Hammond family, all nine of them.
Come on, Mork, let's just go out, you and me.
I mean, we're young, we're in love, we're newlyweds.
You're absolutely right, Mind.
Maybe we should have a little tête-à-tête and then sit and talk.
What's wrong with going out and having some good old-fashioned fun?
We could talk in Latin if you want.
Mork Mind, Mind.
Mind, Mind, how can we lead such frivolous lives?
I mean, when you consider what's going on in the world today.
I mean, trouble in El Salvador, cruise missiles.
I mean, bad line-calls against John McEnroe.
And the family.
Why do you keep bringing up family?
I'd like to have one, Mind.
Right now.
Look, Mork.
I wanna have a family someday just as badly as you do.
But a family is something you plan for.
We're just starting out.
We're not really ready emotionally or financially.
My gosh, my career's just getting off the ground, and yours Well, this is America.
Mork, if we had a baby right now, it wouldn't be fair to the child in the long run.
Maybe down the road a bit.
Now, let's just go out, you and me, - for a good time.
- You don't understand.
Time is of the essence.
Pakistan has the bomb and all they have to do is roll it down the hill.
Mork, we just got married.
It's the time for the two of us, so let's work on that a while, all right?
Now, I'm gonna go get changed, and we're gonna go have a nice candlelight dinner.
And then maybe go for a sleigh ride.
Okay?
And then maybe come home and thaw each other out.
There's gotta be some way we can get you and Mindy together.
Too bad it's not Easter, huh?
- Do you know what time it is?
- I swear I heard somebody.
I didn't hear anything.
- There it is again.
- Who could it be at this hour?
Maybe it's a Jehovah's Witness with the Watchtower with the late scores.
There's nobody there.
Good night.
It might be Claude Rains, Mind.
Good night.
Hey, you!
Come back here!
No, mister, take good care of him.
Look.
Mind, somebody left a baby on our doorstep.
Somebody would leave a A baby?
It's just an egg.
Just an egg, Mind?
Shouldn't we not be prejudiced?
Look.
There's a note down here too.
"I have left my child because I know you'll take good care of it.
You are good, kind, understanding people, especially you, Mindy".
Let's see, it's about 2:30 a.m. Yeah, I think that's a good time for an explanation.
All right, Mind, this is merely conjecture, but I'll give it a try.
A poor, unwed mother is cast out of Boston by her WASP parents.
"Muffy, Tad and I believe that you have to leave, but we packed your few Lacoste shirts and your penny loafers".
She wanders around Boston, selling her own hair and a few Springsteen tickets to raise enough money to buy milk for her child.
That's real That's real interesting, Mork.
Now, how about the truth?
The truth is, Mind, that she was an unwed mother from Thailand whose Buddhist parents said, "Bung How, you have forgot your mantra for the last time".
The truth.
Okay, you want the truth, I'll give you the truth, vérité.
In your hand you are holding our child.
Okay.
Enough for tonight.
It's going back in the refrigerator.
Mind, Mind, Mind!
The world is cold enough as it is.
Daddy didn't mean that.
Mork, this would be one of your better jokes, except men don't have babies, and for sure they can't lay eggs.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
You know that I am a test-tube child without a navel.
And look, wait a minute, let me show you here.
What's that?
See, Mind, I'm telling you the truth.
I'm not lying.
What?
Wait a minute.
Well, you mean No.
You mean, you and l?
When And I?
And then you?
And here it is?
You should work for Reader's Digest, Mind.
No, no, no.
No, no.
Oh, no.
No, I have to sit down.
Oh, no.
All right, assuming that I am not dreaming and that is our child, what is that gonna be?
I don't know, but he's gonna have his own affirmative action program.
I don't think there's anything that has happened to me in my life that could possibly prepare me for the fact that that is our child.
Not even all the Twilight Zones I've watched.
Mind, you told me it wasn't the right time, so I tried to find other parents for it, and then I realized the best parents in the whole world would be you and I. Mind, we'd love this.
I mean, can we keep him?
Can we, Mindy?
Can we?
Well, of course we'll keep it, Mork.
I mean, I'd love anything you and I made together.
Mind, you weren't too crazy about that bookcase.
That was different.
Oh, Mind, at last we have someone we can cherish and have someone who can test our will.
I mean, someone that we can put medication out of reach of.
Mind, is something wrong?
Why would you say that?
Well, I've never seen anyone grit their back before.
Yo, there we go!
No, everything's great.
Mind, you're not really too convincing in that.
You sound like Nancy Reagan saying she doesn't spend a lot of money on new dishes.
Oh, I don't know, Mork.
It's just that I had this insane idea that when you and I decided to plan a family, I would be the one who had the baby.
I don't know, l Maybe I was I looked forward to knowing that there was a baby inside, and craving strange foods and getting fat, and not being able to see my feet.
Oh, Mind, come on now.
Just because you're not the mother, doesn't mean that it doesn't need your love.
- Oh, I know, Mork.
- Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
Come on, you're gonna be the prettiest, softest father a kid ever had.
Thanks.
I just I just need some time to get used to this.
It's just pretty strange.
Mind.
L - I think you'd better hurry, Mind.
- Why?
Because our child is growing faster than a Russian athlete on steroids.
Oh, Mork.
Didn't know I could knit, huh?
It's amazing with a little love how much you can grow.
What is in that egg?
I don't know, Mind, but I hope it's healthy.
I just wanna know if it's a boy, girl or pterodactyl.
Pterodactyls are nice, but they're hard to potty-train once they're airborne, you know.
Oh, Mork.
How can you be so calm?
Don't you think that thing is a little gigantic?
Well, some people show more than others, Mind.
- When do you think it's gonna arrive?
- Well, by the look, about 24 hours.
Twenty-four hours!
But humans get nine months.
Elephants get two years.
I get 24 hours?
It takes longer than that to get Peking duck.
Boy, he can sure kick, Mind.
Are you related to Bruce Lee?
I guess there's not much for me to do at this birth.
Come on now.
You've gotta be a parent too.
Now, come over here and touch it.
Now just pat it.
You know, put your arms around it.
Have you hugged your egg today?
- Oh, Mork, I feel silly.
- You should.
I told you to hug an egg.
Come on, come on, come on.
- It's nice and warm.
- It should be.
I sat on it all night.
- I can hear a heartbeat.
- Why don't you talk to it?
Oh, I don't think so.
Oh, come on now, Mind.
You talk to your plants including that wandering jew.
"Where are we today?
I don't know".
Hello.
This is Mindy, your mother.
Uh, your father.
One of your parents.
I feel like Shari Lewis without Lamb Chop.
Mind, isn't it wonderful?
We're parents now.
We get to say things like, "Don't put that in your mouth!
You don't know where it's been"!
That's true.
Mind, have you thought of a name yet?
Well, yeah.
I'd kind of like to name it Beth, after my mother.
If it's a girl.
And it doesn't have wings.
I have a certain sentimental attachment Attachment to a name if it's a boy.
- What's that?
- Rodan.
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh, a little too ethnic?
Well, how about Jennifer, or maybe Mustafa Joaquin?
Oh, Mork, how are we gonna explain to people that you laid an egg, and we hatched a baby?
And only after one month of marriage?
We'll tell them we had to get married.
I've been thinking about this and I think we should keep this our little secret.
- Mind, are you ashamed of our child?
- Oh, no.
No, Mork, but what if somebody found out it was part alien?
Who knows what they'd do to it?
And then they'd find out you're an alien and who knows what they'd do to you?
Federales!
Federales!
Shh.
Who is it?
- A sad and desperate man.
- Oh, no, it's Mr. Bickley.
Uh Uh, we'll be right there.
We're not decent.
I don't wanna see you.
I wanna talk to you.
- What do we do?
- The bedroom.
No, not now.
We have company, Mind.
- I meant the egg.
- I know that.
I was trying to give a little comic relief in these moments of tension.
Easy, easy, gentle, gentle.
- Mind, Mind, Mind.
- Uh, we'll be right there.
Be careful.
Uh-oh.
Oh, no.
Why do I feel like we're at a company picnic on Saturn, Mind?
I'm counting to five.
Open the door, or I'm climbing into the trash compactor.
- I think it's beginning to crack.
- Oh, Mind, I'll stay here with the egg.
I think it's almost time now.
I hope all this rolling around hasn't turned him into a quiche.
Look, I'll get rid of Mr. Bickley.
Hi, Mr. Bickley.
- What a nice suit.
- Thanks, I'm about to be buried in it.
Oh, Mr. Bickley, you dropped in at a bad time.
- I was washing my hair.
- Please, Mindy, - I don't wanna talk about it.
- Oh, then I respect your feelings.
- Bye.
- I met Dorinda at a Club Med luau.
The second I laid eyes on her, I knew I had to make her mine.
Sure, she was a lot younger than me, but she loved older men.
Oh, it is a nice story, Mr. Bickley, but maybe you can tell me it tomorrow.
Our romance blossomed, and we decided to get married.
So last night I took her to meet Dad.
That's when the trouble started.
- Oh, your father objected?
- No, she ran off with him.
That's too bad, Mr. Bickley.
"Too bad"?
You call that pity?
Where's Mork?
Oh, uh Uh, Mork's in the bedroom having breakfast.
Rice Krispies.
Hi, Bick.
Nice suit you got there.
How's life treating you?
It all started when I met Dorinda at a Club Med luau.
She told me she loved What?
What is that noise?
Oh, I'm just listening to my Exorcist soundtrack.
Little Linda's head is just starting to spin around.
Mind, could you give me a little moral support and maybe a ball-peen hammer?
What's going on in there that's more important than me?
No!
You don't wanna go in there.
- It will only remind you of Dorinda.
- Oh, you're right.
Everything does.
I'll never be able to look at my family album, or eat suckling pig again.
Mr. Bickley, you've got to know that those gray skies are gonna clear up.
So put on a happy face and remember, there's always more fish in the sea.
But I want a girl just like the girl that ran off with dear old Dad.
Mindy, I don't wanna upset you, but I think there's a great big nest over there.
- What?
- Don't you see it?
- Yes.
- What is it?
It's a great big nest.
What the hell is it doing there?
Boy, is Mork gonna be upset.
His pet condor got away.
Why do I come here?
It's going to happen.
You don't wanna miss this like you did Beverly Sills at Marineland.
This is it, Mind.
Isn't it much nicer having the baby at home rather than in a hospital?
Now, it's important that we don't panic, and if we panic, it's important we're not loud.
I just hope it's healthy.
I just hope it doesn't eat the bedroom set.
- I love you, Mind.
- I love you too, Mork.
It's a boy.
It's a man!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
I don't believe it.
Our baby is a full-grown man.
Things like this just don't happen in the Midwest.
I know.
I'll call Dad.
He'll know what to do.
Oh, no, he won't.
That child is astounding.
Absolutely phenomenal.
This is the first time a baby has ever given me a perfect footprint for the birth certificate.
Look at that beauty.
Not a smudge on it.
Great, Exidor.
That's Dr. Exidor.
Now, I know you have a lot of questions for your pediatrician.
This has got to be the most bizarre thing that's ever happened in my entire life.
Don't you think that baby is unusually large?
Baby?
What baby?
Why wasn't I consulted?
I'm talking about our baby.
The distinguished-looking gentleman in the diaper.
Oh, him.
Rather unique.
He seems so alien.
I wonder if there's anything Earthling about him.
Why do new parents always ask that question?
Your baby is half-Orkan.
That means he's aging backwards, and he has three hearts.
But he does have some human characteristics.
For instance, he seems to enjoy a good story.
What?
Oh, Mind.
Mind, I'm a mother.
Huzzah, huzzah!
Here, have one.
They're Tiparillo lights.
Oh, I couldn't have done it without you.
I couldn't have even lifted him without you.
This has just all happened so fast.
I really think we need to talk about this.
Alone.
I suppose I'm not invited to dinner either.
Well, I've got to finish my paper for the medical journal.
Anyway, I'm going to be the best dance critic they ever had.
Oh, Mind, I have to admit, he's the most beautiful child you've ever seen.
Mind, wait till you see the little overalls I got him.
He looks just like Lester Maddox on steroids.
Yeah, he's cute, Mork, in a mature sort of way, but our baby isn't exactly what I was expecting.
Oh, we'll have a girl next time, Mind.
No, that's not what I meant.
Mork, he's different.
I mean, he has the body of a 50-year-old and the mind of an infant.
Well, you said you always liked Jerry Lewis.
Mork, having a child is difficult under normal circumstances, but, Mork, rhinos have smaller babies.
Mind, do I sense a little note of trepidation there?
Now, come on, now, he's a little helpless innocent child.
- Well - Come, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Let's go.
Come on.
No, he's just a little nooter.
Mind.
Mind.
Mind, he can walk.
Mork, he can destroy.
Oh, isn't it amazing?
Isn't he magnificent?
I mean, who ever stood after being only an hour old?
Black Beauty.
There you go.
Come to Mama.
Come on, there we go.
Another one for Baby News.
One more, there we go.
There's one.
There One for Parents' World.
There's another.
There.
Now, a little nother one.
There we go.
Oh, good, good.
There we go.
There.
Playboy.
One for Playboy.
There we go.
Oh, that's okay.
After Dark.
One for After Dark.
Oh, little pooter, little pooter.
Neener-neener-neener.
Ha, ha.
Oh, Mind.
Oh, isn't he the most beautiful?
Oh, little pooter, come on, now, pucker up.
Come over here.
Oh, there we go.
Whoa!
Oh, Mind, isn't he beautiful?
I mean, he's got your eyes and Charles Bronson's beard.
Yeah.
Now, make nice, make nice.
There.
Hi there.
I'm your, uh, father.
Heh.
Oh, that's nice.
I think I've thought of a name for him, Mind.
- Oh Ow!
- No, no.
Here's the name.
Here's the name.
You combine Mork, Mindy and Earth equals Mearth.
Mearth.
Mearth McConnell.
- Well, it is unusual.
- Right.
But then, so is he.
Heh, heh.
There you go.
No, you have to bite off the tip first.
No!
No, he'll choke on that.
No, Mearth.
Mearth, Mearth, Mearth, look over there.
Mearth, look.
No, no, no.
He hasn't eaten since he arrived.
What do you think he eats?
I don't know.
He's got all of his teeth.
Maybe a little beef jerky.
Oh, no, I think he'd rather eat my comforter.
No, no.
No, no.
No, Mind, Mind, Mind.
No.
No, Mind, I think he wants the flowers in the comforter, not the comforter.
- Are you sure?
- I know my own son, Mind.
Here we go.
Look.
Hare Krishna, Hare Lama Hare Krishna Hey there No.
Ah, ha, ha.
Oh.
Mm.
Let's hope there are no bees on there.
- Mm.
Mm.
- Ah.
Ah.
Bathe the baby, bathe the baby.
I told Mork he wouldn't fit in the sink.
- Who is it?
- It's me, honey.
Oh, hi.
Look at you.
Well, I'm just on my way to play a little Dixieland.
- Oh, yeah?
- So how's the new bride doing?
Oh, great.
Heh, heh.
Oh, that's an interesting piece of sculpture.
Is it a wedding gift?
Oh, no, it's not a present.
Actually, it's a piece of a great big eggshell.
What was in it, a Buick?
Close.
Well, I guess there's no putting this off any longer.
I've got something to tell you.
And I think you better take this sitting down.
Well, okay, honey, fire away.
Okay.
Let's see, how should I put this?
Remember when I was 11 and you told me where babies came from?
Yes.
You lied.
Well, now, Mindy, I may have glossed over a few major details, but I never lied.
Right, that's true.
We've always been truthful with each other, so I'm just gonna lay this right out.
See, for some strange Orkan reason, Mork got pregnant, laid an egg, and now we're parents.
Heh.
Boy, I'm glad that's over with.
Uh, are you trying to tell me that I'm the grandfather of a chicken?
No.
No, no, no, it's a baby.
It's a 6-foot 225-pound middle-aged baby named Mearth.
Are you serious?
Dad, don't fall apart on me.
You're the only one I can talk to about this.
- Are you serious?
- I know it's a shock.
It was for me too.
I mean, where am I gonna find size 46 Pampers?
Where is he?
Oh.
Oh, um, uh Mork took him to the park for lunch.
They're grazing in a flower bed.
Heh.
Good.
Come on.
- To the park?
- No, we're going to the airport.
By tomorrow morning, you can be in Brazil.
Dad, I'm not gonna run away.
I mean, he's my son.
I know it's kind of weird now, but I'm sure in enough time, I'll grow to love every hair on his chest.
Won't I?
Well, honey, if that's what you wanna do.
Oh, sure, you will, honey.
Now, you never were afraid of new experiences.
I mean, you married an alien and you went to another planet, and you were the first girl in Boulder to play Little League baseball.
Thanks.
I hope you're right.
You have to realize that most squirrels don't normally fly like that.
My God, it is true.
Say hi to Grandpops.
There we go.
Say "Hi, Grandpa".
There you go.
Neener-ner.
Quick, Mindy, call Air Brazil.
Well, there he goes again, every hour, on the hour, just like clockwork.
Yep.
Well, I'll give him his bottle.
But this time, you burp him.
I think I threw my shoulder out.
Oh, no.
Look, Mork, he tossed out his bottle again.
Here's your bottle.
There you go.
Powdered.
Powdered?
It's not powder, it's He spoke!
Oh, Mind, he's a genius.
Our little baby can talky-awky.
Don't patronize me.
Where would he learn such big words?
Well, William F. Buckley was hosting The Muppets this evening.
Let me see the quality, the porcine and porcupine quality, of the tiny bubbles as the hands motivate the motion.
Mearth, watch Daddy.
Mearth, what's Daddy bouncing on?
- What is it?
- Tush.
I was shooting for bed, but he's right.
Of course he is, Mind.
He's half a superior being.
What?
All right.
And who are you?
- Who are you?
- Mearth.
- And who am I?
- Mommy.
Oh.
Mind, I feel just like Anne Bancroft in The Miracle Worker.
And now the big question, no pressure, though.
- Who's this?
- Mm - Shoe.
- Shoe?
Hey, isn't that wonderful, Mind?
His first non sequitur.
- Mork, he called me "Shoe".
- Funny, you don't look Shoeish.
Oh.
Come on, now.
Come on, now, my little Mearth, my little whiz kid.
Say "Daddy".
Daddy.
Tired.
Mind, he's bilingual.
Great, he's bilingual.
You're Mommy and I'm Shoe.
Don't worry about it, Mind.
He still loves you.
Besides, he'll be up again in another hour and we'll try again.
- Good night, hon.
- Good night.
Night, Mearth.
You know, Mork, now that he's talking, we're gonna have to be careful no one finds out he's an A-L-I-E-N.
If anyone should find out that Whoa!
Mind, what are you doing on the floor?
Looks like I got squeezed out.
- I just wanted to cuddle.
- Aw.
He's just afraid, Mind.
We saw The Shining today, remember?
I don't wanna go now.
Oh, that's all right.
There's not room for the three of us.
I'll sleep on the couch.
Oh, no, no, no, you do the honors.
I'll be more comfortable on the couch.
- Night, Mork.
- Night, Mind.
- Night, Mearth.
- Night, Shoe.
Come in.
Mork, what happened?
Have you been robbed?
No, Mearth and I were just playing Morkie Dearest.
Three-hundred-dollar dress on a wire hanger?
- Let me untie you.
- No, no, no, that's all right.
It's the only way I can sit through Phil Donahue.
I see.
You know, Mork, little Mearth I mean, big Mearth kind of took me by surprise, but the bottom line is, I am his grandfather.
He's my grandson, so it's about time I started spoiling him.
- Oh, football.
He's gonna love that.
- No, Mork, it's baseball.
I knew that.
That's what you do before you start selling coffee machines.
Well, okay.
So where's the bride?
Oh, Pops, you'll be so proud of her.
Perfect American father.
She comes home late, never plays with the kids, and brings in the paycheck.
Uh, Mork, I don't think you understand what a good father is.
You see, good fathers wanna be there as much as they can be.
- Oh.
- It's wonderful to watch your children grow up, and it's It's wrong that she's missing it.
Oh.
On third thought, Pops, I guess you're right.
If it wasn't for Mr. Sternhagen forcing her nose down to the grindstone, she'd be here right now.
- What are you talking about?
- He asked her to work the night shift.
Oh, well, no, he didn't, Mork.
Didn't Mindy tell you that she volunteered for the night shift?
Oh.
I feel like I've gotta sit down.
Oh, you are sitting.
Just bend your legs.
How convenient.
Oh, Mindy asked to work the night shift?
- Do you know what that means?
- I'm afraid I do.
Will you tell me?
All right, Mork, I'll try.
Uh I think Mindy is confused and apprehensive about being a parent to Mearth.
What she needs is time to be close to the child, and then love will take care of the rest.
Oh.
You're right, Pops.
No house of mine's gonna become a broken home.
No way.
Whoa, Houdini, watch out.
Mearth, come on, now.
We're gonna go find Mindy.
Well, give me a head start.
It's gonna take me a while.
Uh, Mork, you're not gonna let him go out like that.
Oh, you're right.
Mearth, go put on your jacket.
Well, isn't this an exciting feature?
We'll be back after this commercial to the KTNS Science Fiction Festival and the dramatic conclusion of It Came From Diablo Canyon.
Here we go, come on in.
Mind, I got here as fast as I could.
Mork, what are you doing here?
And why is Mearth up so late?
I have to make a report to O-R-S-O-N.
- About what?
- Sagittarian women.
What?
Wait.
- Mind, I can't talk.
- You can't leave him here like this.
Take care of him.
Take care of him.
I'll be right back.
Hi, Mearth.
Heh.
So, Mearth, where did Mommy take you for lunch today?
To a Japanese restaurant, and I had tempura and sashimi and bonsai tree.
Bonsai tree?
Oh, yeah, that sounds nutritious.
So, what do you think of where Daddy works?
Pathetic.
I have better stuff than this in my room.
Fake.
No, no, no, don't touch that.
Oh, no.
Oh, Mearth.
Mearth.
Daddy didn't mean to scare you.
It's just that Daddy's rocket ship is not a toy.
When's Mommy coming back?
Well, soon, I hope.
Mearth, you have on your pitcher's mitt upside down.
Here, let me help you.
Did Mommy teach you how to play baseball?
No?
You put it on right Give me your Here, give me your hand.
No.
Mearth, look over there.
Now, give me your hand.
Help me.
Want me to teach you how to play catch?
Yeah?
Okay.
Come over here and Daddy will teach you how to play catch.
Whew.
Mearth.
Mearth, we're gonna I'm gonna throw the ball, and you catch it, okay?
Okay?
Now, you keep your eye on the ball.
Mearth, watch the ball and catch the ball.
Here you go.
One, two, three.
Oh!
Mearth, look over there.
What's that?
What's that over there?
Yeah.
We're gonna try this again.
Whew.
Oh, that's all right.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
This time I'm gonna throw it, and you catch it in the mitt, okay?
You catch it in the mitt.
Okay?
Here we go.
Watch the ball.
One, two, three.
Ooh.
And they call this the national pastime?
Mearth.
This time, Daddy knows you're gonna catch the ball.
Put the mitt like this, okay?
Here we go.
One, two, three.
- Oh, he caught the ball!
- Oh!
Ah!
Daddy.
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy - What'd you say?
- Daddy.
That's great, son.
- You did real good.
Wanna try again?
- No.
Room for one more?
Mork, I'll bet there wasn't an emergency at all, was there?
Yes, there was, Mind.
You didn't feel part of the family.
I guess I have been running away.
But you know what?
I'm gonna quit this night job so I can spend all my time with you two.
Oh, this is a wonderful moment.
We're so much happier than the Jeffersons.
You know what would make me really happy?
If Mearth would call me Mommy.
Mearth?
Mearth.
Mommy, Mearth.
- Mommy.
- Mommy.
- Mommy.
- Mm-hm.
Daddy.
Shoe.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Your Grandioseness.
Hello, Mork.
You seem to be in an unusually good mood.
Hitting the ginger ale again?
Oh, no, sir.
I'm high on life.
Just hold on to your fish sticks.
I had a baby boy.
A baby?
What a completely outdated concept.
Oh, sir, come on, now.
I know you're gonna love him because judging by your size, he could be yours.
Sir, I just happen to have a few photographs here with me.
Can I show them to you, please?
Here they go.
Eh-ee.
Here he is at 2 hours old.
He seems very alert for a child his age.
Oh, yes, sir.
Eh-ee.
Here is his first piggyback ride.
And here's a family portrait.
Eh-ee.
This one was snapped just before we were airborne.
Well, Mork, I must admit, he is rather exceptional.
Oh, sir, I'm glad you think so.
Because Mindy and I want you to be the godfather.
Me?
Absolutely not.
I am not getting involved in your barbaric Earthling matters.
Oh, I see.
He does look a little like me, doesn't he?
Well, sir, especially around the equator.
Oh, a check.
Oh, thank you, godfather.
Mm-mm.
Oh, sir.
Oh, this will assure him of a college education, or at least a hamburger and some onion rings.
Until next week, sir, na-no.
A buck thirty?
Such a big man, and he gives so little.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Well, it's been about two and a half hours since we've seen Superman.
I think it's about time you guys came in for a landing.
Come on, Mom, you can join in with us.
Just because you're a girl, you know, we won't make fun of you.
- You can fly just like we can.
- Yeah, Mind.
Lots of women can fly.
I mean, look at this: There's Tinker Bell, there was Grace Slick.
There was, I mean, Amelia Earhart.
She still may be up there, but her luggage always arrived.
Even the Wright Brothers came down for milk and cookies, Mearth.
Oh!
So you liked your first movie, huh, Mearth?
Well, I really did enjoy the movies.
You know something, I've been thinking, Mom.
Now, as I understand it, - Superman has two jobs, right?
- That's correct.
- Okay.
And Mommy has one job.
- Correct.
And Daddy watches General Hospital.
Well, no comment.
Oh, no, Mearth, your daddy has a job.
He watches you.
Not during General Hospital.
Gee, you know something?
I hope when I grow up I'll be just like Superman.
I thought you wanted to grow up to be just like me.
Why?
- Oh, Mearth - Take it out real slow, son, real slow.
Mearth, your dad's wonderful.
No, come on, that's all right.
I'll take it over.
Son, I have lots of wonderful qualities.
I'm prompt, I'm Jump in any time, Mind.
Your father is loving and special and unique.
- Yeah, but he can't fly.
- Just because I can't fly doesn't mean I don't have a lot in common with Superman.
I mean Well, I mean, he's an alien from the planet Krypton and Does the planet Ork mean anything to you?
Whoo.
Well, you know, Mearth, I think it's way past your bedtime.
So why don't you take your milk and cookies and go upstairs and put on your Dr. Denton's?
- Okay.
- Okay?
Oh, boy, back up to that Fortress of Solitude.
Boy, I tell you, I'm gonna really plug in that electric blanket tonight and, mm, watch kitty go "rawr"!
Mork, I thought you agreed that we wouldn't tell Mearth you're an alien until he gets younger.
I know, but he's been talking up that guy in the tights again.
Oh, Mind, listen, I mean, even Superman can't do this.
Watch.
Eee Mork.
Tsk.
- Mind, I bet he can't do the carioca.
- The what?
Got the carioca Mork, you don't have to prove anything.
You have your son's respect.
Listen, all kids go through a form of hero worship.
Believe me, it'll pass.
I guess you're right.
But just to be on the safe side, from now on, I'm only gonna take him to hear Slim Whitman sing Aida.
What you doing, Mind?
Oh, just brushing my hair and making some notes.
Doing that both at the same time?
Boy, you're one up on Gerald Ford.
What are the notes for?
Well, Governor Lamm is taking a skiing vacation up in Aspen, and Dewey Fishbeck's going up to interview him, so they asked me to write questions for him to ask the governor.
How come he's not writing his own?
Well, Dewey's the anchorman.
All he knows how to do is joke about the weatherman's sports coat.
Well, time for me to hit the old sack.
Okay.
I'm just gonna leave the light on for a few more minutes, okay?
Oh, that's all right with me, Mind.
I've slept through an eclipse.
Heh, heh.
Yeah, you know Ugh!
Can't sleep.
Insomnia!
Oh, oh.
The restless Oh, the tossing, the turning.
Oh, you know what's wrong, Mind?
I don't have my little guy's respect up there, and R-E-S-P-E-C-T, that's what it means to me.
He's just infatuated with a movie.
Just like you were with the midget wrestlers.
Terry the Teeney Terror didn't have a spit curl and red boots.
Mork, will you forget the movie?
You have your son's respect.
No, I don't, Mind, and why should I?
I mean, you bring home the bacon.
All I do is collect the grease.
You have the biggest responsibility of all, raising a child.
Gloria Steinem didn't buy that one, Mind, and neither do I. I mean, I want my son to look up to me.
Even though he does have the height advantage.
Mind, I've gotta go out and get myself a job, a legitimate job.
Mork, you already have a job, and that's being an observer for Ork.
My gosh, that's like being an ambassador to the entire planet.
Yeah, but I can't tell anybody, especially my own son, Mearth.
I mean, Mind, I want to have a job I can talk about.
I mean, come home and complain about the boss, hang around the water cooler, chat with friends, flirt with my secretary, get drunk at the Christmas party and make a fool out of myself.
I mean, something a son can really respect.
Mork, listen, if your mind's made up, it's fine with me.
I just want you to realize it's not that easy to get a good job.
Mind, I am a superior being.
I mean, I can get any job I want, and if by some fluke of fate I can't, well, I can always write a diet book.
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
Little boodle bugger.
What a day it is outside, huh?
I mean, I'm talking about blue, blue, blue sky, Paul Newman blue, you know, like "bing".
It stretches all the way to the Flatirons.
If John Denver isn't writing a song now, he's missing a million-seller.
Yeah, mm-hm.
Good day job-hunting?
Oh, heh.
I mean, the possibilities are infinite.
- Oh.
- I've narrowed it down to two things: Either giving blood every day for the rest of my life or the job at Remtec of nocturnal surveillance official.
Nocturnal sur Could that be anything like night watchman?
Oh, well, that's a generic term, yes, Mind.
Oh.
I know the profit sharing, the pension plan, the perks aren't what they should be, but I do get along very well with the Doberman.
Well, at least you have options.
Yes, oh, Mind, Mind, it's so good to know that I can expand my knowledge into so many fields and have the ultimate security and confidence to carry on like that.
And what is one suitcase packed and ready to go?
Well, I have to go away for the weekend to Aspen.
Oh, that's fine, Mind.
I'm about to lose my son's respect for life, and you're off barrel jumping with Peggy and Rhonda Fleming.
Mork, it's a business trip.
Oh.
Oh, you're deserting me for business, Mind.
That makes me feel a heck of a lot better.
I thought it was personal.
Mork, come on.
I love you, and I'm not deserting you, and here comes Mearth.
We'll talk about it later.
- Hi, Mearth.
- Hello, son, hello.
Wait a minute, pilgrims.
Just stay away from that water hole.
It's contaminated.
And don't fill your canteens until I tell you.
Mork, I think his voice is changing.
Oh.
Mearth, do you have a frog in your throat?
No.
I have John Wayne in my throat and I have a frog in my pocket.
Daddy, I wanna ask you something.
I was upstairs watching TV - and I saw a Western.
- Hmm.
I wanna ask you, have you ever?
Have you ever strung up Well, I once stopped a lady in the express line who had too many items.
Boy, I bet everybody at the supermarket sure thanked your daddy.
Uh, I was wondering, is somebody going bye-bye?
- Yeah, I am.
- Oh.
See, Dewey Fishbeck had an allergic reaction to his toupee, and his head is covered in hives, and so I have to go to Aspen to interview the governor.
Interview the governor?
Oh, my gosh, that is important.
Daddy's doing something important.
Daddy's making macaroni tonight with cheese.
- Mm!
- Mm.
Not nearly as important as what you're doing.
Well, it's American cheese.
Oh, American cheese, Mearth.
Boy, I wish I could stay here with you and your daddy and have macaroni.
Mom, go on and see the governor.
Incidentally, do you think you could get his autograph?
And if you can't, I'd just as soon have yours.
Mearth, could you help Mommy by taking her skis down to the car?
It'll be an honor.
Now, Mork, I don't want you to overreact.
He's just a child, and he's easily impressed.
Tomorrow his hero will be Reggie Jackson.
Oh, good, another person I can't compete with.
Oh, I really feel like I should stay.
Don't be silly.
Don't worry.
I mean, you know, I'm the eternal optimist.
I can be down right now.
Life's just a seesaw.
I can be down one moment and then, whoop, back up again.
Hello?
Speaking.
Remtec Corporation?
Shh, shh, shh.
I scored very high on the IQ test?
I had to play dumb.
Ha, ha.
The personnel director liked me?
Nothing can stop me now, Mind, I got it.
Nee-nee-nee Yes.
Mm-hm.
Yes.
Thank you.
You did it, Mork, you did it.
What makes you say that, Mind?
Well, you just said that the personnel director liked you and you scored highly on the IQ test.
Well, when they put my personality profile through the computer, they found out if they left me alone with a Doberman that he'd bite my head off and bark down my neck.
Well, by the time you come back from your trip, our son will have finally disowned me, so you take care and have a nice time.
Mork, would you give me a hand?
Oh, hi, hi, little pooter, - I missed you.
- I missed you too Oh!
Don't touch me there.
I've got a bruise.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, don't touch me there either.
- Another bruise?
- No, the same one.
It goes all the way around.
Heh.
You know, everybody always told me I was a good skier, but Governor Lamm makes Jean-Claude Killy look like a snow bunny.
Oh.
It sounds like you were skiing over your head.
I was skiing on my head.
The governor suggested that we start out on something called Tammy's Run.
I figured, how difficult can anything be named Tammy?
Well, that's before I found out it was named after the late Tammy Ericson.
You ski right past her headstone.
You can't miss it.
And I didn't.
- Come here, little pooter.
- Thanks.
Well, compared to us, you had a swell time.
What do you mean?
Is Mearth all right?
Well, yes.
He didn't stir-fry his toys or anything, but I think I should start at the beginning so you can understand how innocently this disaster started.
Disaster?
Oh, Mork, don't tell me about a disaster.
Okay, Armageddon.
While you were off gallivanting with the governor, I felt about as useless as a lawnmower on AstroTurf.
It was a very crisp, clear day, and it began very innocently with a breakfast of fresh fruit and hog jowls.
Mork, will you get to the point?
Come on, I was just trying to set the mood.
I mean, no wonder the novel is dead as an art form.
Well, it all started off with a simple lesson in geography.
And then the wheels of catastrophe started to turn.
Now show me a country where it's legal to marry your livestock.
- Let's see, right here.
- Yes, that's right, India.
If we can't eat them, at least we'll make them part of the family.
- All right.
- I don't wanna play geography anymore.
I really don't.
I wanna play hide-and-seek.
Well, no, we have to do our lessons.
Okay, then if we have to do our lessons, where's Metropolis?
Where does Superman live?
Huh.
All right, as the world turns, let's play hide-and-seek.
Okay, tell you what, we can combine the two.
We'll combine geography and hide-and-seek.
I'll be Russia and you play a small third-world country and I'll have to find and dominate you through military and economic aid.
Here we go, ready?
Okay, here we go.
You promise to keep your eyes closed, Daddy.
- All right.
- Please.
Okay.
Dad.
Daddy, what's this?
Well, that's my space Oh.
Well, what do you think it is, son?
Well, it's the most attractive costume I've ever seen.
Look at this, how beautiful, and this, whatever it is, this diamond pointing down towards the man's shoes.
Gosh, and look at this on the back.
The same diamond pointing down to his shoes in the back.
It's incredible.
Are you trying to tell me that this doesn't belong to a superhero?
Let's not jump to any conclusions, son.
Maybe someone sang with the Commodores, you don't know.
Please, come on, Dad, you can level with me.
I mean, you know, I'm not Lois Lane or anything like that.
I'm your son, Mearth.
Come on, tell me the truth.
All right, son, well, I'll level with you.
The truth is this is mine, but I'm not now or never have been a superhero.
Oh, gee.
Not another major depression.
I can't handle I've had four today.
Well, son, son, wait a minute.
It doesn't mean that I can't be a superhero.
I mean, it's a perfect job for me.
I mean, I could be my own boss.
The hours are perfect.
How's this sound to you, son?
How about this?
Mork McConnell, crime-fighter.
Does that make you proud?
Why, it sure does.
Son, that's what I've been waiting to hear.
- Then you've got it.
- Wait a minute.
Could I go out there and battle evil with you?
All right, but if you see any criminals from the Phantom Zone or any large farmers from the central time zone, you just find someplace safe and watch your daddy swing into action.
Dad, I'm so proud to be able to serve with you.
Oh, son.
Son, don't you worry about a thing.
- Whew.
Ooh.
- Ha, ha.
I'm gonna go back there and change into my superhero costume.
- Dad.
Dad.
- Don't worry about a thing.
It's a little cold outside, son.
You think it would tarnish my image if I wore Mommy's muff?
I wouldn't wear the muff.
I really wouldn't wear the muff, Dad.
You're still my hero, but don't wear the muff, okay?
See that, son?
Never too old for nap time.
Come on in here, get a quick cold drink, and get on our way.
I don't know, Dad.
We've been walking around for two days.
Gee, we haven't seen one decent crime.
You know, Superman flies.
It's a bummer having to ride the bus.
Superman can't make exact change like we can.
Who in the hell are you?
Well, just two ordinary people trying to take a fashion risk.
We'd like two milks, please.
Uh, incidentally, could I have a glass with Fred Flintstone on it?
I think we had some milk around here once.
I'll check and see if it's still liquid.
This is the kind of place we might find a man who will violate law and the American way.
Oh, Dad, God bless you.
You sound just like Steve Garvey.
All right, now, what's with you?
Who are you, anyway?
I'm Mork McConnell, crime-fighter and part-time superhero.
Oh, really?
Ha, ha.
And who are you, Wonder Woman?
I happen to be Mearth, his important sidekick.
Just give me a straight answer, just a straight simple answer, before somebody here hands you your kneecaps on a platter.
Come on, Dave.
It ain't worth it.
Listen, you guys don't belong here.
You could get hurt.
Take a hike.
There's a bar down the street that caters to superheroes, okay?
I can't go there.
You see, I'm not union.
Oh, son, come on, now, I think there's a lot of tension in here.
Let's check out the jukebox and see if they have the love theme from Alien.
Hey, Dave, how are you doing?
- Charlie, how are you?
- All right, how about a beer?
I don't think I'd be hanging here.
There been some people asking questions about you.
Hey, don't worry about me.
Nobody finds me unless I want them to find me.
- Wrong again, Charlie.
- Heh-heh-heh.
Heh-heh-heh.
We figured you'd show up sooner or later.
Daddy, he's got a gun.
- Do something.
- You're right, son.
Well, do something!
Hold it right there!
How about you dropping that gun before I hand you my kneecaps on a platter?
Hey, thank you, partner.
Oh, no sweat.
Will someone now call a policeman?
I'm a policeman.
Oh, this is gonna be a black mark on your record, Dad, if you go through with this.
Looks like I'm gonna have to split town again, but I'm a little short on cash, so Ah.
Dave, will you empty the till?
And everybody else, you empty your pockets.
- I don't have any pockets.
- Ah.
Good.
Then you get to collect all the cash.
Oh, my pleasure, sir.
Lovely seven and three-quarters.
- Donations are greatly appreciated.
- Dad, Dad, I plead with you.
Don't do this.
That cap is filthy.
You don't know where it's been.
Besides, the money you're taking from these guys, I'm sure Son, now, please, son, please.
Now, that's a criminal over there with a gun, and the surgeon general has determined bullets can be hazardous to your health.
Now, please.
I'm not Superman Thank you very much.
- And even if I was, I wouldn't want to see you or these people hurt.
Now, son, please, please.
I'm not a coward.
Hey!
Who said you could move?
He was just helping me, that's all.
Shut up!
I told you, empty the pockets.
All I have is a frog in my right pocket.
Please, he's telling you the truth, Charlie.
Oh, I'm a nonviolent person.
Here, take your money and go.
Leave us all alone.
Hey, I happen to be a violent person, so shut up.
- I told you, empty the pockets.
- Hey.
Stop that.
I'm warning you.
I want those pockets turned inside out.
What have you got to hide?
- Ow!
- Nobody, nobody, hurts my family.
What's doing this?
What the hell is going on here?
Daddy, what happened?
I don't know, son.
We'll just hope it never happens again.
Come on, you're safe now.
Let's go home.
You know something?
They said Chicago was the Windy City.
Then the newspaper reported that a freak tornado touched down in a small bar.
It was really scary, Mind.
I mean, I didn't know I had that kind of rage inside of me.
I'm afraid of what'll happen the next time I open a pistachio and there's no nut.
Well, Mork, you were protecting Mearth.
But I only wanted his respect and put him in a dangerous situation.
I know.
You did take it too far, but it's normal to want respect from Mearth.
Daddy, I have so much respect for you.
Oh, Mearth.
Mearth, I missed you.
I was gone for two days.
You, I know, I know, I know.
Gosh, you know, while you were gone, - how brave Daddy was.
- I heard.
He took a gun away from a criminal.
He did, he did.
And he didn't even muss his hair during the tornado.
Well, I guess I owe it all to Ann Miller's hair spray.
Daddy, you're so great.
See, Mork?
You've been searching for something you had all along.
- You really mean it, son?
- Of course I do.
You're everything to me.
I mean, you play with me, you read to me, we watch TV together.
We're together all day long.
Oh.
Mearth, I mean, what about Superman?
He's a joke.
He doesn't mean anything to me.
He's a fake.
He's fictitious.
Mearth, why don't you tell Daddy who your new hero is?
Oh, come on, Mind, he doesn't have to, really.
I will.
It's the governor.
I got that from you, Dad.
That's your sense of humor.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in Hola.
Oh, excuse me, Ola.
I must have the wrong mind.
I'm looking for Orson.
Orson no in casa.
This is his housekeeper, Keezbalita.
Keezbalita, could you turn off the vacuum?
Oh, thank you.
That's much better.
But where's Orson?
He's no in casa.
Well, I have a report for him, Keezbalita.
I can take a message.
Well, will you tell him, please, that Mork called, and that this week I learned that fathers put too much pressure on themselves to be the apple of their child's eye?
They should be concentrating on being loved for what they are, not what they think that they should be.
- Did you get that?
- You bet.
I tell Orson Monty called.
Na-no.
I work five hours on a report, and somebody named Monty gets all the credit.
Well, patience, patience.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Don't worry, Mearth.
Daddy and I won't be home too late.
You're obviously deserting me.
Ooh, I bet I know who that is.
It's Grandma.
Oh, you're gonna have so much fun with her.
No, we're not.
All she does is wanna play canasta.
I'm going to hide.
Okay.
You hide on Grandma.
- Hi.
- Hello, dear.
- Thanks for skipping your yoga class.
- Oh, it's my pleasure, dear.
Wow.
Mindy.
- That dress is a knockout.
- Thanks.
You're going to be the hit of your high school reunion.
Oh, I hope so.
To tell you the truth, I'm a little nervous, though.
I really haven't kept up with anybody except Glenda Faye.
I don't know if I'll have anything in common with anyone else.
No, I suppose that may be true.
Yes.
You're married to a spaceman, you have a full-grown son No, I don't think you'll have anything in common.
Ha, ha.
But I'm dying to find out what happened to everybody.
Yeah.
Well, now, where's my little Mearth?
Oh, I don't know, Grandma.
Oh, I'm sorry he isn't here.
Why, it's too bad, because I have a special treat for him.
A special treat?
You know, I have brought him a great big delicious, mouth-watering salad.
Ugh.
Oh, no, salads are for bunnies.
Oh, Mearth, I'm only kidding.
Look, I brought you a ton, a whole ton, of brownies.
I guess so.
Ooh.
Now I think about it, I guess you're just about my favorite babysitter.
Then when I really think about it, you're the only babysitter I've ever known.
Ho!
My team is red-hot Your team ain't doodley-squat Kick them like a horse Kick them like a donkey Come on, now Let's beat those honkies!
Where did you find my old cheerleading sweater?
Where you hid it.
Last night when you were trying it on, you thought I was asleep.
You were like this: I didn't do that.
- Oh, you sure did.
- I did not.
Oh, yes, you did.
No way, no way, no way.
If you're going to go, you'd better shake a leg.
Oh, you're right, Gram.
Mearth.
Mearth, now, we want you to be a good boy, and you mind Grandma, okay?
I will, but you have to promise me that I can dye Grandma's hair.
- No.
- I wanna dye her hair.
No.
That's what we're talking about.
Now, be a good boy.
And we'll call later - to make sure everything's all right.
- Okay.
- We'll be here.
- Okay.
Don't worry about a thing, dear, and have lots of fun.
- Just go for it.
- Ha, ha.
Thank you.
We'll do everything she used to do in high school.
We'll forge hall passes, we'll TP the hallways, we'll abuse substitute teachers.
Ha, ha.
I never did stuff like that in high school.
Oh, in that case we'll just date the entire football team.
Yeah.
Bye.
Be a good boy.
- I will, I will.
- If you can't be good, be reasonable.
And Daddy loves you.
- Whoo.
- Ooh.
Oh, I know you.
Mindy.
Mindy McConnell, right?
I'd recognize you anywhere.
- He one of your old boyfriends, Mind?
- No.
Uh, Dickie Nimitz, this is my husband, Mork.
Gosh, you married Mindy?
She wouldn't even go to the library with me.
- Oh.
- She wouldn't go with me unless I married her first.
Ha, ha.
Well, I couldn't make that kind of commitment.
- Well, here's your badges right here.
- Oh.
Don't get them mixed up and wear each other's.
Now that we're great pals, we should start hanging out together again.
How about the library tomorrow?
- Oh, sure, we'd love to - But we can't.
My library card expired.
- See you later, Dickie.
- Yeah, excuse me for living.
Oh, here they are, Mr. And Mrs. Snugglepuss.
Mind, you said there wouldn't be a natural blond here.
Ha, ha.
Oh, you're such a little pudding face.
- Can you believe we're here?
- No.
Isn't this weird?
Don't you feel we should be putting on our gym suits and playing a game of dodge ball?
God.
Ten years and nothing's changed.
- Oh.
- Oh!
Mindy!
Mindy McConnell!
- Who are you?
- Mork.
Mindy's Mindy's better half, the yin for her yang.
Oh, smuggling basketballs, Mrs. Boyce?
Yeah, this is my husband, and you're, uh, pregnant!
- There's Dickie Nimitz.
- Yeah.
We used to have so much fun in the library together.
- Aah!
- Dickie!
Dickie Nimitz!
- Who was that?
- Althea Flyly.
- Althea Flyly.
- Yeah.
She played the lute in the marching band.
- Oh!
- Remember?
No.
Well, I guess some things have changed.
But you haven't.
Have I?
Well, you don't wear that headband quite so much anymore.
Mork.
Uh Uh, how about some punch?
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm hypoglycaemic.
- I meant for me.
- Okay.
Not sure you're gonna like it.
Someone dumped some old fruit in there.
It's kind of brown and I'll go.
Mindy, Mindy.
He's here.
Who's here?
Don't you try and play cool with me.
It's Steve.
Steve Sanders.
Go talk to him.
I know you're dying to.
I mean, you wore his ID bracelet for two years.
But I haven't seen him in ten years.
I wouldn't know what to say Hi, Steve.
Thirty-three left, - Pardon me?
- Your old locker combination, Mindy.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my God.
He remembers your locker combo.
How romantic.
If that really makes your toes tingle, this'll really knock your socks off.
This is our zip code.
It's, um, 80 - Mork.
- Oh.
Darn, I had it.
Steve, this is my husband, Mork.
- Oh.
- For sure, totally and what it was.
I've seen you somewhere before, haven't I?
Maybe you went to Fairview, wasn't it?
No, I went to Chester A School for Boys.
Oh, no.
There goes Tommy Perozzi.
- Remember?
Bad skin, great car.
- Ha, ha.
So, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
- Hard to believe it's been ten years.
- I know.
Yeah.
Tell me everything.
- Well, I got married.
Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.
- Wing.
Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.
And, uh, well, I went into journalism.
In fact, I'm working at KTNS.
- Oh.
- I do the news sometimes.
But mostly I just assist the manager.
Stuff like that.
Well, what are you doing?
Me?
Oh, well, I'm still single, and right now I'm lieutenant governor of Wyoming.
- Wow.
- Lieutenant.
Mm!
I didn't even know Wyoming had an army.
So you don't mind if we have a dance for old times' sake, do you?
Oh, no, take my wife, please.
Okay.
See you.
Oh, yeah, have her back by 2.
Ha, ha.
Hey, Mork!
Mork!
Steve and Mindy, together again.
Just like the senior prom.
Oh, there they go!
Smooch, smooch, smooch.
Ha-ha-ha.
Ha, ha.
That's all they ever did in school.
Once I caught them necking behind the library.
Steve beat me up.
But I respected him for it.
I was a creep in those days.
Ha, ha.
- Time sure does fly, doesn't it?
- Yeah.
Ha, ha.
Aren't you even jealous?
How can you just sit here and watch your marriage dissolve?
Oh, pshaw.
I mean, I trust Mindy farther than I can throw her.
I mean, I don't have a jealous bone in my body.
But I'm willing to rent one.
Okay, here we go.
Now, Evel, you get $50 million if you clear the three boxes.
Okay?
Got it, come on.
Vroom.
I hope he makes it.
Don't you?
Don't you?
Don't you?
He made it.
Yes.
Mork, how long are you gonna keep this up?
It's just silly.
Silly?
Last night I saw a side of you that I rarely ever see, Mind.
- Oh.
What side?
- Your back.
Because your front was too busy talking to Steve.
Mommy, are you and Daddy fighting?
- Yes.
- No, Mearth, sweetie.
Your dad and I are just having a little disagreement.
We really love each other very much.
Yes, your mom and I love each other very, very much, but that's why we have to be alone for a moment.
Now, you go in the bedroom and play with the invisible dog that Uncle Exidor gave you.
Okay.
I just can't believe it.
Come on, Pablo.
Let's go.
Pablo, come on.
We're going to the bedroom now.
Drop that.
That thing's been dead for days.
Drop it.
Drop it.
Arf, arf.
Come on, come on.
Oh.
You probably just think I'm overreacting, don't you?
- Yes.
- A silly Orkan venting his jealousy.
- Hmm?
- Mm-hm.
It pretty well sums it up, Mork.
You're upsetting yourself over something I told you was over with ten years ago.
I really think I deserve a little more of your trust than that.
Yeah, I guess I have been kind of foolish.
Yeah, come to think of it, I don't even know what What's his name?
Oh, Stevie.
Stevie.
Heh, heh.
So it's Stevie now?
Oh, the pain, the anguish.
The solitude.
Now I know how the other two Supremes felt.
Ain't no mountain high enough Ain't no river Mork, listen to me.
The only reason there was ever a Steve in my life was because I hadn't met Mork yet.
Do you understand?
No.
Okay, be that way.
I really don't have time for this.
I've gotta get to work.
Bye, Mearth.
Mommy has to go to work.
I'll see you later.
Daddy, Daddy, who won?
Well, we both did, son.
You see, we had a little problem there, but now everything is just tutti-frutti.
Oh.
- Hello.
- Flowers for Mindy McConnell.
Oh, thank you very much, and here's your tip.
Never eat Mexican food and stand next to a flame.
Oh, what's in this?
Oh, no.
Isn't that neat?
- You bought flowers for Mommy.
- No, I didn't.
Heh.
- I'll carry these.
- Let's see.
No, I never bought any flowers for Mommy.
Let's see here.
"Mindy, it was wonderful seeing you last night.
Let's not wait another ten years.
Love, Stevie".
Who's Stevie?
He's the lieutenant governor of Wyoming and your future stepfather.
Is that right?
Well, Pablo, better saddle up.
We're on our way to cattle country.
Come on, Dad, blow.
Oh, Mearth, you're such a comfort to me.
Hope I get to at least see you on weekends and leap years.
Are you kidding?
Mommy loves you, Daddy.
I know that, but the problem is that Mommy loved someone else before she loved me.
That's very possible.
But you must know now that she loves you more than anything in the world, Daddy.
You're number one, you're the head honcho.
I hope you're right.
But what if you're wrong?
Don't ask me.
I haven't been able to cope with fractions yet.
I'm gonna take these flowers and be sure that they stay alive.
I guess I'll put them in the tub with Pablo.
I don't think he'll mind after carrying that dead thing around.
Pablo.
Woof, woof, woof!
I wonder if she would have loved me then.
Well, I've got two choices.
I can either stand here and talk to myself like a soap opera or go back in time and really find out.
That's it.
I'll do it.
I haven't used these in a long time, but now's a very special occasion.
Oh, well Of course.
Look.
Liberace's lounge slippers.
I want those shoes.
I was an alien when I met her.
I'll go back, I'll be an alien again.
It should work the second time around.
Yeah.
Should work.
Ready now.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like severe pain in the ankles.
No, wait.
I'll go back in time.
'71, here I come.
'71, here I come.
Red light!
Red light!
Nobody gets in here without a student ID.
That's the rules.
I am student.
I am foreign-exchange student.
Happy to be in America.
My name is Vladimir lvanovich Orkoff.
But you can call me Chuck.
Look, Chuck, I don't care if you're Doctor Zhivago.
Nobody gets in here without a student ID.
Beat it before I'm forced to get physical with you.
- What seems to be the problem here?
- This foreign guy's trying to crash.
I'm trying to keep this gym safe for democracy.
Ah.
Well, I think there's a more reasonable way to deal with this.
Oh, thanks, Pops.
I mean, Mr. McConnell.
Do I know you from someplace?
I come by the music store all the time looking for a copy of Brezhnev Sings Ray Charles.
You know: Georgy, Georgy Look, Dickie, he's an exchange student.
- I think we can let him in.
- Tsk.
Thank you very much.
If you ever come to Soviet Union, I can get you such beautiful women.
You know, Soviet girls.
Hey, I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, especially since you're the only guy here without a date except for me.
Whoa.
Who is she?
She is one foxy mammal.
Boy, I would walk ten miles in the snow just to stand in her garbage.
That's Mindy McConnell.
You might as well forget it.
I've been after her since the second grade.
You'd think by now I'd at least have gotten a pity date.
She's only got eyes for that nerd Steve.
Well, I don't care what you say, I am going to marry her.
Dream on.
Boy, she's got a Jiffy Pop hairdo too.
I may not be a poli-sci major, but I still think that history will prove that Nixon is a great president.
I think Karl knows what he's talking about.
He writes for his college paper.
Really?
Do they have a good Journalism Department at Columbia?
Come on, Snooks.
How are you gonna be a reporter?
In a newspaper, you can't dot your I's with little hearts.
Give me a break, Stevie.
Good evening.
How are you?
Permit me to introduce myself.
I am foreign-exchange student Vladimir Ivanovich Orkoff.
But you can call me Lumpy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Excuse me, but would beefy all-American type mind if I trip the light fanatic with his princess all-American beauty?
Are you kidding?
This is a gag, right?
- You're in the Drama Department?
- No.
No gag, please.
For one dance, I will give you actual autographed picture of Joseph Stalin.
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
- Really?
- You know Stalin?
- Personably.
- Some other time, okay, pal?
- Sorry.
Later.
On the rebound.
So tell me, Vladimir, what part of France are you from?
I wish you'd just mellow out, Steven.
The poor guy's from a foreign country.
I don't know why you're being so uptight tonight anyway.
I just thought he was kind of immature for a senior.
Steve.
Steve, some of the guys are drinking beer in the bathroom.
If you came with me, they'd let me watch.
Beer?
Be right back, Snooks.
Great.
So you're gonna leave me here and go get loaded.
Hey, if it wasn't in the boys' room, I'd take you with me.
- Hi.
- Yo.
Heh.
So do you like being a foreign-exchange student?
Oh, it's not bad.
It's I come to Boulder to study Russian literature.
Boy, that's kind of redundant, huh?
Heh, heh.
You know, my art teacher went to Russia once.
She said Well, she said it was, like, really different than from here.
Well, it's all right.
Well, let me enunciate to you.
It is basically a You know in 1964, you had the Beatles invasion?
Well, in 1968, we had the Czechoslovakian invasion.
You got music, but we got land.
Ha, ha.
Will you like to maybe, um, well, you know, boogie now?
Shake your booties.
- Oh, you want me to dance with you?
- Oh, please.
Oh, I can't.
I'm going steady.
But I thought this was the land of the free and the home of the foot-long hot dog.
Well, it is.
- All right, I'll dance with you.
- Oh, whoa.
I must do like you do.
Hey.
Look, I'm drowning.
Boy, I love this country of yours, you know?
- You do?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess we are pretty lucky here.
You know, I was thinking about maybe being a journalist.
I'd really like to tell people what's going on in this country.
- Right off.
- But I don't know.
It's kind of a hard field for a woman to break into, and I don't know if I'd be any good at it anyway.
Oh, you must, uh, go for it, you know?
- Really?
- I think that someday your family will be so proud of you.
Thanks, that's really nice.
How do you say "thank you" in your country?
Oh, um Well, like this: Oh.
Ha, ha.
That's nice.
You know what else I was thinking about doing?
I've had enough of you, borscht brain.
Wait.
Wait.
I have my green card.
Wait, please.
I would not like to do Esther Williams - Steve, that's enough.
- Attention!
Attention!
This is the moment we've all been waiting for.
It gives me great pleasure right now to announce the names of this year's prom king and queen.
I hope this isn't another failing notice.
Ha, ha.
Okay, act your age, not your IQ.
Ha, ha.
Okay.
And the winner is Katharine Hepburn!
Just kidding.
Oh, big surprise.
Steve Sanders and Mindy McConnell!
Oh, how dreamy!
I knew it!
I just knew it!
Okay, make way!
Make way!
The king and queen are going to dance.
Well, I hope you're happy.
Yeah, we won, didn't we?
- Is that all you care about?
- They're taking our picture.
Smile.
It's the biggest night of your life.
Yeah, it just might be, Steve, because this is our last date.
- What?
- I used to think you were a really nice guy, but I've changed my mind.
Later.
Lumpy, will you dance with me?
Oh, you're asking me, a humble peasant?
Whew.
Ten years in two minutes flat.
The in-flight movie wasn't that bad either.
They finally found a place to show Heaven's Gate.
- Hi.
- Oh.
Oh, hi.
Mind I came back because I feel that we really haven't cleared the air about Steve.
Aw.
Come on, now, Mind, that's all in the past.
You know, jealousy's just insecurity, and you've never ever given me anything to feel insecure about.
I love you.
Oh, Mork.
You know, sometimes I think I've waited my whole life for you.
Thanks for showing up.
Well, thanks for waiting.
I better go check on Mearth.
Today we're gonna teach Pablo how to avoid hair balls.
Oh, I picked you up a little something.
- Oh, that's nice.
- Yeah.
- A little surprise.
- Mm-hm.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
No, don't cry, please.
Hi.
Hey, what's wrong with Mearth?
- There's been a death in the family.
- What?
His spider died.
What?
Herman?
Oh, poor baby.
Well, I guess you're not in the mood for seeing the nice present your mommy and I got for you.
What?
Presents, Mearth.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Look, a giant lollipop.
Oh, my gosh!
That is a big sucker.
Boy, I guess this is just about the best present I ever got.
Or is it?
Aw, Grandma.
Ha, ha.
Whoo.
Gosh, you know something, Grandma?
And Mommy and Daddy?
You see inside there's Mr. Silver.
That's what I'm going to call him, Mr. Silver Helmet.
Mm.
Here we go.
Oh, Mind, a minute ago he was crying, and now from zero to bliss in 60 seconds.
Look at that.
Well, Mork, you see, with children, sometimes just a little present will do a world of good.
- Oh, a little preschool Abscam.
- Ha, ha.
Mearth, don't do that in the house.
You might break something.
Oh.
Look at her go, son.
A loop-de-loop.
Wait a minute, Mayday, Mayday, there's a Chihuahua on the landing field.
Oh, don't look, son.
The little Chihuahua had an overbite and he got your plane.
What happened?
Mr. Silver was eaten by a doggy.
First it was First it was Herman, my spider, and now Mr. Silver, in the airplane.
I just don't have any friends, Grandma.
Oh, don't cry, Mearth.
Don't cry.
You still have your lollipop.
I guess you're right.
Ooh!
But Herman, he's stuck to it.
Oh, well, son, look at the good side.
Now you got an all-day spider.
He's a lot bigger than I remember him.
Here, Mearth, hand Mommy your coat.
Mommy.
The tooth fairy has been keeping up with inflation.
Gee, I wonder who could be behind all this.
Surprise!
No, not really.
Oh, son, look.
All this is for you.
You're never gonna be sad or cry again.
No, never.
Even that big TV?
Yes, you'll finally see all the lines on Dick Clark's face.
Mork, why does our place look like Bob Barker's den?
I don't know, Mind.
Maybe Bob has the same couch.
Ride on this great big green grasshopper.
Isn't it marvelous, Mind?
I feel just like UNICEF.
Mork, these things have got to go back.
This is no way to raise a child.
You'll spoil him with all these gifts.
I am still making the same salary for three as when there were just two of us.
And we have to dip into our emergency savings account just to feed him.
He eats more than Trigger.
Mind, come on, now I'm sorry, Mork, but this stuff goes back.
Not the harp, though, Mind.
Not the harp.
Mind, you don't understand, like He Mearth is a musical prodigy.
The other day we were going past a music store Let me show you.
Mearth?
Mearth, son.
- Yes?
- Will you play that?
- That concerto you wrote for Mommy?
- Surely.
Okay, this is for you and Mommy.
A concerto.
Winter's coming There's snow on the windowsill Winter's coming There's Uncle Bill Listen to the leaves They're all gone As I sing this autumn song There's winter Snowfall, snowbells Everybody's dancing in the snow And I see you Whoa.
Mind, isn't that beautiful?
He wrote that himself.
Yes, Mork, that was cute.
You tell him it goes back.
I want him to have everything I've never had and still don't.
It's no way to raise a child.
Don't you see?
If you give him everything now, he'll have nothing to look forward to later.
- You've gotta tell him.
- Oh, it's gonna be so hard.
- It'll break his little heart.
- Mm-hm.
You tell him.
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.
It was your idea.
All right.
I know that.
- Mearth?
- Yes?
- Son?
- Yes?
- You're really not our child.
- What?
Mork!
All right, Mind.
I was just kidding, Mearth.
You see, the real truth of the matter is that, well, your mother and I are getting divorced.
Mind, after two of those, this is gonna be an emotional lay-up, you know what I'm saying?
Mearth, the real truth is that we can't afford all these little goodies, and they've gotta all go back.
I'm sorry.
I read you.
You just You and Mom don't love me anymore.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I can handle it.
I can handle it.
I know what it is to be crushed.
I lost a spider today.
I lost a man in an airplane.
The dog ate him.
Surely I can handle you.
- You just don't love me anymore.
- No, Mearth.
Oh, no.
Don't start.
No, it's okay.
I'll find, you know I'll find something to do upstairs in my room.
Like maybe, you know, playing with the shadows on the ceiling.
Well, are you happy now, Mind?
Oh, Mork, he'll get over it.
As painful as it seems now, it was all for the best.
You don't wanna spoil him like that.
You're right, Mind.
Yeah.
He wouldn't have looked good in this fur coat anyway.
What size is that?
Answer the door already.
Never mind.
I'll get it myself.
Mork, you're late.
I'm having a barbecue.
I just dropped over to borrow a spatula and a grill, some briquettes, hamburgers, buns, matches and a volleyball net.
How come you're not there?
Well, I wasn't invited.
Just as well.
This is for my musical-comedy workshop only.
Exidor, you've gotta help me.
I wanna shower my son with gifts, and Mindy says we can't afford it.
Who's right?
Mork, I'd like to help you, but this is the wrong time.
I got 40 starving people in my backyard singing "Brigadoon".
You need money, go find work.
Well, I've tried to find a job, but I have no skills.
Well, that leaves real estate.
Please, I have some pride.
Mork, I'd like to help What?
There's always one idiot who comes to a barbecue who doesn't eat meat.
Now, regarding this problem with your son Exidor, either you've had a revelation, or someone just kicked a field goal.
Mork, I've just had a vision of incredible clarity.
It was just like having the cable.
I now know how you can take care of all your family's financial needs.
Mork, money is the key to happiness.
And the only way to make money is to spend money.
Mork, you've got to make that once-in-a-lifetime investment that will take care of all your family's financial needs.
Well, Exidor, all we have is $900 and my stock in Air Libya.
Perfect.
This will be bigger than Polaroid, Genentech and bootleg tapes rolled into one.
What's the one thing the world needs more of?
Nixon impersonators.
I'm talking about bigger, grander, something the world keeps crying for more of.
- What?
- Me!
Guillermo, keep an eye on the store.
I'm going in the back for more inspected-by-number-seven tags.
Who would have thought Mickey Mantle would end up this way?
Wow.
Come on, Mind.
This place is wonderful, just like what the Marquis de Sade would've done if he'd gone into retail.
Yeah, this is a great location, Mork.
You walk through an animal hospital, knock twice, ask for a man named Juanita, then slide down a pole.
How many times you see a hamster neutered on your way into Macy's?
Oh, isn't this to die over?
I see 20 things I already wanna get.
Oh, Mindy.
Yeah.
I don't I don't see 20 things I can identify.
Look, Mind, you'd look smashing in something like this.
Oh.
Anthony Quinn wouldn't look smashing in something like that.
I think Exidor is onto something hot here, Mind.
I think he's got a great new concept.
You've heard of Old Amos?
Well, how about these?
Exidoreos.
Chocolate, cheese and meat.
Mm.
Look, Mork, I admire Exidor's initiative, but if somebody told me he was gonna open a store, this is exactly what I'd expect.
I mean, it's just It's just ridiculous.
Oh, Mind, you call this ridiculous?
Yeah, I'd say that just about defines the word.
Mindy, come on, you can't be so negative.
You've gotta find something positive about this whole experience.
Well, the color combination on this cookie is excellent.
Oh, you see?
That's wonderful.
Because you know what?
You, Exidor and me, we're all partners.
- What?
- In the tradition of J. Pierpont Morgan, J. Paul Getty, and Jay and the Americans, I have invested our $900 in the Exidor Boutique.
Don't hit me, don't hit me.
I have corrective shoes on.
Mork, you may have seen me angry before, but now I'm talking real angry.
I'm talking black poet, you know what I mean?
Yeah, Mind, l Boy, some people don't know how to handle sudden wealth.
I mean, Kenny Rogers wouldn't behave this way.
Come on, Mind, you should be happy that I made a shrewd investment.
You call giving all our money to Exidor shrewd?
Why didn't you just flush it instead?
Unless you've got an inside tip, Mind, I think that's pretty risky.
Hello.
You are head of a household now.
That means you have responsibilities.
Not only to yourself, but to me and especially toward your son.
And that means you can't take risks with our future.
I'm not taking a risk.
Taking a risk is slicing a bagel without turning it.
Mork, you can't make an investment unless you can afford to lose.
And we can't, and now we're gonna lose everything.
Well, come on, now, Mind, don't panic.
Exidor knows what he's doing.
What do you mean the mannequins want a coffee break?
They just had one ten minutes ago, and all they did was dribble.
Partner!
Glad to see you brought the little woman.
We want our money back now, and don't call me "the little woman".
What she's trying to say is, Exidor, we're We've had a change of heart, like Renée Richards wanted to change dressing rooms.
I've only been open two hours.
Even Evita didn't pay off its backers that fast.
We want our money back.
Look, business is a little slow.
But we're gonna have our two-for-one sale.
Buy two, get one.
Who can resist that?
That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Listen, perky.
Are you insinuating I'm some kind of crackpot?
Well, that's what they said about David Rockefeller.
Nobody ever said that about David Rockefeller.
I did.
Pepe.
Pepe, you call yourself a tailor?
Just lengthen the sleeve.
Don't clip his nails.
Come on.
- That's it, our money is gone.
- No, no, come on, now, I know.
I'm sorry, I was just trying to increase our wealth.
I know it's a risk.
It's a dumb thing.
Even dumber when I bought the soundtrack to Beatlemania, but it was an incredible simulation.
- Mork.
- Mind?
Mork, I'll grant you one thing.
Your heart is in the right place, but sometimes your head is in - Oh, never mind.
I'm going home.
- Mindy, listen.
This is America.
You can come from another country with a name like: And leave with a name like Chuck.
Easy.
There's gotta be a way out of here.
Mind, come on.
He can sell anything here.
If they can sell designer jeans and pet rocks, we gotta be able to sell this stuff.
There's gotta be something we can do to make people want this.
Wait a minute!
What are you watching?
Good afternoon.
I'm Mr. Mork, and I'll be your guide on this incredible journey through the totally outrageous world of Exidor, where style and elegance meet for a very brief moment.
Won't you join us for this incredible fashion smorgasbord?
And let's bring out our first model.
Sissy?
In the evening, Exidor comes alive, and so does Sissy in this smashing formal ensemble.
Note the dual-purpose jacket, which converts into a fashionable pup tent.
Too campy?
Ah.
Oh.
Thank you, Sissy.
And now, what is this?
The Exidor evening gown.
Ideal for dining in elegance or with Pancho Gonzales.
Because it converts into tennis, Exidor?
Yes, I bet she's got some good strokes, huh, fellas?
That's game, set and match.
Thank you, Sissy.
I think I'd like one of those myself.
And now, what could be more Exidorian than Exidor himself, modelling the executive Exidor?
Yes, for the man on the go who can't say no and, well, who drives well in the snow.
Yes, for the true executive, it says, "One good audit puts me in jail for life".
Now, for you urbane urban cowboys, it's go west, young Exidor!
Whether you're on the fringe or just living on welfare, that's right, Hi-yo Silver, giddy-up, move it, horsey.
Whether you're riding the mechanical bull or throwing the bull mechanically, or just trying to figure out what do-si-do means, our Exidor Western wear is just for you.
Ladies and gentlemen, aren't these delicious?
Don't you just want to take them home now?
Yes, unisex robes for all occasions and every mood, with no fear of visible panty-line.
Well, you say stop teasing, let's get to the real goodies.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to show you our incredible swimsuit collection right now.
It's something that will really Tell me something, Daddy.
Do you think there'll be other children to play with in debtor's prison?
Thirty-five for gas.
All right, what next?
Forty-two dollars for telephone?
Mearth has Daddy been calling Dial-A-Joke again?
- Mearth?
- I'm no fink.
Yes.
Oh, family, family, I have wonderful, wonderful news.
I sold my Air Libya stock, and look, we got $2.
We can live on this for about an hour.
Oh, Mearth Oh.
Oh Mind, you tell him the truth.
I can't look in those innocent brown eyes, especially with those crow's feet.
Mearth, see, Daddy did a really dumb thing.
It's not that bad, Mind.
Mearth, Daddy's upset because he made a little mistake.
Saying it's a little mistake is like saying Lizzie Borden was a little nuisance with an ax.
Mearth, l I've I lost all of our money.
Oh, I feel like a snail trail without the glitter.
Mork, don't be so hard on yourself.
Everybody can make a mistake.
And you happened to make a big one.
But we'll get by, I think.
Well, you can forget about the boutique.
I dumped it.
And it's a good thing.
Otherwise you'd be rich too.
- Rich?
- Rich?
It's making money?
- The place has gone through the roof.
- Why?
I suppose you're wondering why.
Teenagers.
They'll buy anything their parents hate.
Now everywhere I go, everybody's wearing Exidor outfits.
Infants, teenagers, Lee Radziwill.
Exidor, you're a mogul now.
I'm miserable.
I was just trying to appeal to the intellectual fringe.
Money doesn't make you happy.
I don't know, Ex, it sure perked up Melvin Dummar for a while.
Here, perky, here's your investment plus profit.
This isn't Monopoly money.
This is real money.
Of course.
I sold out.
I'm just designing now.
The person that bought it is a little strange, but business breeds strange bedfellows.
- Grandma!
- Oh, there you are, Exidor.
I'm sorry I'm late, but it was really brutal getting up that pole.
Grandma, why?
Wise up, Mindy.
A buck's a buck.
You know, when you dress like that, you remind me of my own grandmother.
She was a strange woman, heavy into voodoo.
Mind, look.
This is marvelous.
At last, we can buy Mearth a little something.
Maybe a DeLorean car.
Mommy, I don't want you to worry anymore.
What you gave me is that wonderful set of toys that's here.
Imagination.
Look, for instance: Okay, give me an O. Give me a K. Give me an L. I should never have sat on the Texas side.
I tell you, there's trouble.
What is it you said, sir?
"Let the games begin"?
Oh, neat.
They should never have held the Olympics in Australia.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Your Tub of Lardness.
Na-no, Mork.
- Sir.
So how's that godson of mine?
Oh, sir, he's in the pink.
And me?
I'm a wreck.
I didn't realize being a parent was so difficult.
I thought the only difficult part of being a parent was going into labor.
Well, sir, that's the short view.
But in the long view, children test you every day, and you can't slide through the essay questions.
Why not send the child to obedience school?
That'd be nice, sir, if you wanna teach a child to heel or roll over.
That's not teaching about life.
You have to give them love, understanding, companionship, and, boy, am I lucky I have got Mindy.
- Mork.
- Sir?
I never realized raising a child involved so much responsibility.
Oh, sir, being a parent is always on-the-job training.
By the time you learn the trade, you're out of the business.
But if you do things correctly, you'll always be connected with the firm.
Till next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Na-no, na-no.
All right, you've seen what we did to him.
Now, tell me where the others are hiding.
Somehow that makes me so excited.
Hold on.
There we go.
And the crowning touch.
Finished at last.
More than one way to make a child eat healthy food.
Today a vegetable snowman, tomorrow a liver collie.
Oh, Mearth, Mearth, look what Daddy made especially for you.
Yes!
Oh, sweetheart, stop crying, it's all right.
No, it isn't all right.
It isn't.
I don't have any friends.
None at all.
Nobody will play with me.
I feel just like George Steinbrenner.
Son, wait!
Wait, you haven't even seen what happens when I add the gravy.
Poor little guy.
He was having such a good time in the park on the sled hill - and then he tried to get on toboggan - Wait a minute.
You went to the sled hill and you didn't take me?
Will you let me finish please?
He tried to get on the toboggan, and when he did, the parents pulled all their kids off.
They thought he was a man.
Oh, Mork, you should've seen the look on his face.
He's starting to realize he's different.
You're right, Mind.
I guess he doesn't buy our story about being just big-boned, huh?
Well, it's time to tell him that he's half-Orkan - and half an Earthling.
- Wait a minute.
He still might be too young to accept it, Mork.
Let's just wait till he's older or younger.
Or Whatever.
Oh, come on now, Mind, he can accept it.
He's half a superior being.
I mean look at me, I'm an alien and I have made a remarkable adjustment.
You see Do I smell salad burning?
Probably.
Oh, I forgot to baste it.
It's not a pretty picture, but, you know, it's homemade.
I should never cook on medication.
Oh, Mork.
Let's just try to protect him for a while longer.
He's just a child.
Daddy, could I borrow one of your new razor blades?
The reason I ask is mine are all dull from trying to sharpen my crayons.
Oh, surely, son.
See, I wanna get this real clean, so that I can play with the kids, or they in turn will play with me.
You know, solitaire is a game, but it's not a way of life.
- Maybe now is the time to tell him.
- You're right, Mind.
This is a very delicate situation.
We have to choose the words very carefully.
What's that?
Well, the title is Rejection Descending a Staircase.
It's my blue period.
Oh, don't feel that way, sweetheart.
You have Mommy and Daddy.
Not just Mommy and Daddy, it's Mommy and Daddy and Señor Goodnews.
Señor Goodnews has something he wants to tell you, doesn't he, Daddy?
He sure does, Mind.
What about that, Señor Goodnews?
Why should I?
He's your child.
Take responsibility.
Oh-ho-ho.
- One of you tell him.
- All right.
Tell you what, let's take a vote.
What do you vote for?
I vote for the shiksa queen.
Me too.
It's unanimous.
Are you chickening out?
You got it, sweet shorts.
Mearth, sweetheart, have you ever noticed that you aren't exactly like all the other kids?
Of course.
For instance, the other day in the market, I was the only kid that couldn't get in the wire basket.
Mearth, sweetheart, the reason is, you see The reason is, son, me.
You see, I'm not exactly a hometown boy.
I'm not even in the ballpark, as they say.
I'm from another planet.
No!
Stop that, Daddy.
Stop it, you mustn't You mustn't kid around like that with me, especially when I'm your only child.
Sweetheart, Daddy isn't kidding.
Maybe Mommy can explain it better.
Look over here, Mearth.
See, Mommy's using visual aids.
She's telling the story really well.
That's the letter O. This is the planet Earth.
You were born here and so was I. And way over here, millions and millions of miles away, - is the planet Ork.
- Yes, you see.
Ork, the "Show Me" planet.
I flew all the way from Ork back here to Earth.
I don't know.
I just don't like the tone of this conversation.
Son, you see, I was sent here to observe.
- Si?
- Yes, si, observe.
And I met your mother and she couldn't keep her hands off me, and the rest is history.
And that means that you're half-Orkan and half-Earthling.
Is that why I'm different from the rest of the kids?
Well, just for a little while.
But pretty soon you'll look like them because you see, the Orkan part of you is aging backwards so you're getting smaller.
And the older you get, the younger you'll look, just like Lena Horne.
See how unique you are, sweetheart?
I'm not unique.
I'm a freak.
Kids call me Butchie, the dog-faced boy.
Oh, sweetheart, don't you ever think that.
You know, on Ork, all the kids look just like you.
And someday Daddy's gonna take us there.
Well, why can't he take us there now?
Well, we can't go there now, sweetheart, because you live here with us and Grandma and Grandpa.
And me with these little, stupid balls on my head.
Why me?
Why do I have to be different?
Well, being different isn't bad.
Come on now, son, look.
Look at the good side.
You'll never have to do jury duty, you'll never have a vaccination mark.
And you can do wonderful neato things like this.
Watch.
- No, no.
Stop it.
Stop it.
No.
- Mork, you're scaring him.
Mearth, sweetheart, I know it's hard for you to understand now, but later you'll see that you're very unique and there's no one else like you in the whole universe.
Yeah.
We love you, little half-and-half pint.
I don't know.
This has all gotten terribly heavy for me all of a sudden.
I have to be alone, that's all.
I have to be alone.
Okay, well, we'll be downstairs if you need us, all right?
Okay.
Poor Mearth.
Probably harder for him to understand than an episode of Hill Street Blues.
Don't.
Mind, I love it when you wear just the hat.
Animal.
Oh.
Mearth, breakfast time!
Come and get it, come on now.
- Mind!
Mind, he's not there.
- What?
What?
He's gone.
This was on his bed.
Oh, no.
Mork, I knew we shouldn't tell him he's an alien.
- Mearth's run away.
- Let's be calm now.
I'll go out and look for him and you stay here in case he comes back.
- How you gonna know where to look?
- Be brave, little "pooter".
We Orkans have an incredible way of communicating with each other.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Mearth!
Mearth!
Where the hell are you?
No one's ever gonna be able to fill my kid's shoes.
If they had these on the Titanic, four more people would have lived.
Oh, Mork, we've looked everywhere.
We just can't find him.
- We're gonna have to call the police.
- Oh, no way, Mind.
If they find out he's our child, they'll lock us up.
And I'm not that eager to see a Johnny Cash concert.
Did you find him?
- Yes and no.
- What do you mean?
The airport, I saw him at the airport.
If he wandered in the coffee shop, he's probably still waiting for service.
- Come on, Mind, let's go.
- No, no, no.
He's with those cult people in the black robes.
The Utopians?
Yes, they wouldn't let me speak to him.
A cop told me Mearth was a grown man and could do whatever he wanted to.
Next thing I knew, they were driving him away in a van.
Mind, come on, let's put the pedal to the metal, hop in the Jeep and go find Mearth.
Mork, it's not gonna be that easy.
Remember when I did that piece on the Utopians?
Yes, and they'll brainwash people until they'll give up everything.
Even their identities.
Oh, sounds like a cult we had on Ork called the Rosorryians.
They try, but they can't get the stains out of your dry cleaning.
Well, if we can't call the police, what are we gonna do?
We're gonna take action because nothing's gonna stop me from finding my child, except for one thing, I don't know where he is.
The Utopians have a retreat up in the mountains not too far from here.
But it's protected like a fortress with barbed wire and guard dogs.
Sounds like it'd be easier to get James Watt into the Sierra Club.
The only thing we can do is to try and break him out ourselves.
Mindy, that sounds dangerous and I'm gonna go with you.
No, Dad, you'd really be better if you'd stay here by the phone.
He might call.
And if we're not back by midnight, turn off the Crock-Pot.
All right, Mind, haul tush, haul tush.
Utopians, welcome our new brother.
Baba Swell has taken his first steps to a life of eternal devotion, which reminds me, our love is strong, but candle sales, they're slipping.
Now I want everyone to go their separate ways and meditate on the color green.
You know something, Baba Hope, you talk pretty.
Now, Baba Swell, it is time for you to rid yourself of all your worldy possessions.
Jewelry, money, second-trust deeds?
I really don't have any of those things, but I have Bonzo.
He's thin.
That's because I stepped on him about a half a dozen times.
- Is that all?
- Not quite.
I have a half a yo-yo.
It's a yo.
Never mind.
You go, continue training with your love broom.
Eventually you'll get your full heart and graduate to busboy on steak night.
I don't believe I caught your name.
My name is Baba Gentle.
I knew it.
Baba Gentle.
Bye-bye, Bonzo.
Bye-bye, yo.
Some outsider tried to interfere with us taking him at the airport.
To avoid any trouble, we're shipping him out tonight to our Oregon retreat.
We have a worker convert and we're keeping him.
Mork, come on.
I'm in.
I can't, Mind, I've got my hem caught in a sprinkler head.
Ow!
Why couldn't we have gotten those designer robes with the slit up the side?
Shh!
Let's just find Mearth and get out of here.
You check up the stairs and I'll look through here.
Mind, Mind.
I've got a better idea.
You check down here and I'll hide under your robe.
I'm just as scared as you are, but we gotta think about Mearth.
- Right.
Who?
- Somebody's coming.
Shh.
So that's what happened to our old anchorman.
Let's get these robes back or there's gonna be one judge looking real casual.
You sweep up in here.
I will go feed the love attack dogs.
Goody, goody, Baba Gentle.
And say hello to Baba Bow-wow for me, will you?
Mearth, don't scream, it's us.
Mommy and Daddy, I'm not Mearth anymore.
No, I'm Baba Swell.
Everybody here loves me.
I went out to the airport, you see, to try to get some flights to Ork.
There were no flights.
Who came along but the Babas to save me.
They were good to me.
This place is like Utopia, you understand, except the food.
Ugh.
All right, sweetheart, Mommy knows all about this place and it's not what you think.
Come on, we're taking you home.
I can't, I can't.
I can't go.
I can't.
You see, I'm Baba's love child.
Oh, no, Mork.
They've gotten to him.
What will we do?
It's all right, Mind.
I can deprogramme him.
So Baba Love loves you, huh?
Well, where was Baba Love when you had that cold, huh?
Hmm?
Did Baba Love take you to the park and teach you how to eat string cheese and, enh, like that?
- No.
- Shh.
Come on, it's time to go now.
I can't.
I want you meet my friends.
Wait, wait, I want you to meet my friends.
- No, we can't.
- Mearth, Mearth!
- What's going on here?
- Anybody order a Zen pizza?
He was trying to take me home and I just Outsiders.
Seize them!
Easy, easy, please, be gentle with them, be gentle.
- Let go!
- Ow!
Is this the way you treat emissaries of Baba Love?
If you're emissaries, why are your robes different from ours?
Well, these are our away uniforms.
This is an outrage!
We bring you a special message from Baba Love.
Yes, yes, ditto.
Children, perhaps this is the dental plan we've all been chanting for.
- What is it?
- What is it?
Yes.
Tell them what it is, Baba Loo.
Thank you, thank you, Baba Pooter.
Baba Love sends his love and so does his brother Bubba, who plays for the Green Bay Packers.
You know, Baba Love not only sends his love because Baba Love is love.
Score now, love-love.
I want to talk about love just for a moment.
We know that love is a wonderful thing.
It is a powerful thing.
And sometimes it is misspelled by girls dancing at Grateful Dead concerts, going "Love, look it love".
We know We know that this can be a meaningful experience.
But love is no substitute for recreation.
What Baba Love wants to plan for the 80s is a new concept: Play!
Yes, let's put the fun back in fundamentalism.
You know what I'm saying?
Because now, we're going to have the first annual Baba Love Scavenger Hunt!
They're lying!
Utopians don't go on scavenger hunts.
You dare doubt the word of Baba Love?
Oh, make two lines now.
Let's put together a little human car wash.
Okay, ladies, there we are.
We must decide what we are going to look for on our scavenger hunt.
Okay?
Here's a list of things we'll all be looking for.
Number one, one burning or badly-charred bush.
One Also, one partially hidden truth, some new or used karma, anything else you can find, one copy of The Prophet autographed by Shaun Cassidy, uh, one pair of Naugahyde women's panties.
Now, first couple back wins a dinner for two at Baba Love's House of Prayer and Ribs.
So good luck, happy hunting and be here now, if not, get there later.
Don't move!
Whoa.
You're really generating some negative energy here.
I think what you need is a sign from Baba Love.
Whoa!
Heh.
You got it.
All you Baba's, A through M, follow me.
The rest are on your own.
- Wait a minute, Mearth.
- I'm going on a scavenger hunt.
Bup-bup-bup.
Mearth, we just wanna talk to you for a minute.
But I wanna catch up with them.
I don't wanna be left behind.
Mearth, Mearth, why did you run away?
Well, because I was an alien.
The kids wouldn't play with me and I finally I finally found a place where everybody was the same.
So you wanna be just like everybody else, huh?
Well, Mearth, that's an easy thing to do.
That's very safe.
But being different, well, that takes a lot of courage.
All right, you can stay here and never have to think, or make a decision for yourself.
Or you can go out and go to the real world and have joyous confrontations with hypocrisy, violence, nuclear holocaust, and over-bearing sales people.
Yes, Daddy's right.
There are a lot of bad things, but mostly there's good in the world.
Oh, please come home, Mearth.
No one could ever love you as much as us.
We love you for who you are.
- That's right.
- Yes, but who am I?
You're Mearth McConnell, our son.
You want me to come home?
For sure?
- Yes.
- Okay, can I keep the robe?
- Yes.
- Can I go on the scavenger hunt?
- No.
- No.
Just testing.
Bye-bye, broom.
Boy, it's sure good to be back in my little warm egg again.
Good night, sweetheart.
And remember, if you ever have problems, you can come to us.
You don't have to run away.
We're your family.
Thank you, Mommy.
Good night, son.
Oh.
Oh.
- Go to sleep.
- I will.
Oh, Mork, it's so nice to have him back.
And it's great to be a family again.
Oh, Mind, it's so nice now that he knows he's an alien too.
Think of all the wonderful things I can teach him.
I mean, teach him to sit on his face, drink with his finger, the old Orkan songs.
Mommy hates to be a killjoy, but it's too late for Orkan stereo.
Good night, Mearth.
Big kiss.
Why'd you cut us off, Mind?
There was a part for you in the musical.
Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson, come in, O Pudgy Potentate.
Mork, is that who I think it is?
Oh, yes, sir, it's the universe's one and only Mearth McConnell.
Sir, it's been a very difficult week for Mearth because Mindy and I had to try and explain the truth about his heritage.
He must have been devastated to find out he was half-Earthling.
Oh, no, sir, au contraire, it's the other way around, you see.
Finally he learned to accept his birthright and his heritage and the fact he can't order off the children's menu.
- Very commendable, Mork.
- Thank you, sir.
Now, let me say na-no to the little fellow.
Oh, certainement, sir.
Mearth, come down here and say hello to your godfather, the big O. Na-no, sir.
It's an honor to meet you, sir.
Na-no, Mearth.
I see you make up in manners what your father lacks.
You better believe it, Fatso.
What?
Pardon me, sir.
It's nap time.
We'd better be running along.
Until next week, Thunder Thighs, Mork and Mearth signing off.
Na-no.
Na-no.
- Fatso?
- I called that guy
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Na-no, na-no.
- What is this stuff?
- We've got a surprise for you.
Chinese food!
This looks like boiled grass.
Look.
Ooh.
- Pass it over.
- Careful, Mearth.
Oh, dandruff.
- Oh, I love this so.
- Oh, my.
Oh, oh, oh.
Fish net.
Whale skin, whale skin.
- Hold on now, what's this?
- It's just what it is.
- It's just orange, eat it.
- Orange.
It's sweet.
I'm hypoglycemic.
- Gran-pop, let me ask you something.
Mm-hm.
Do they have American carry-outs in China?
- Uh, no, not yet.
- No, but every religious holiday, all the Chinese people go downtown for Jewish food.
Oh, I'm a very inquisitive child.
You probably noticed that.
And you know something?
I believe I'm truly ready for school.
All the other children are going to school.
Why aren't I going to school?
Son, your mother and I can teach you everything you need to know at home.
I mean, Abraham Lincoln studied at home.
- Who's he?
- Mind?
Well, Mearth, Abraham Lincoln was our 16th president.
I just feel weird.
I just feel different, that's all.
I should be going to school like the rest of the children, that's all.
I should be going to school.
Son, you don't need to go to school.
I mean, since Jeopardy's been canceled, what do you need to know?
I mean, you can always get a job on Family Feud.
Show me mayonnaise.
Sweetheart, an education is very important.
And we're gonna see that you get a good one somehow.
You're not old enough for school yet.
Besides, there's plenty of time for school.
Think of all the fun you're having around home.
You have got to be kidding.
You think it's fun just going upstairs and coming back downstairs and occasionally having some Chinese food?
Do you call that living?
Mearth.
- Sweetheart.
- No!
Sweetheart, you're a special little boy and you're just gonna have to be patient till we make Mearth.
We make special arrangements.
No!
No.
Mearth, now mellow out.
Mellow out.
"Mellow out, mellow out".
I wanna go to school.
I wanna be like the rest of the children.
I'm not going to sit here with four or five boxes of empty goldfish cartons.
I wanna go to school.
That's enough, young man.
Go to your room.
- I said, I wanted to go to school.
- Go up now.
It really didn't hurt me at all.
You just happened to crush my Karl Malden picture.
School.
I'm going.
I wanna go to school and I said I wanted to go to school.
I'm going.
Uh, Mork, I don't mean to interfere, but I think you've got a big problem on your hands.
Psst.
Psst.
Not now, Mork.
I've gotta get up in the morning.
It's not Mork.
It's Orson.
Orson.
Um, where are you?
I'm using the speaker in Mork's ear.
You and I need to have a talk.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
I'm not here to make an appointment with you.
But I'm not gonna go into Mork's head.
That's an invasion of his privacy.
But then he and I never did have any secrets.
How do I do this again?
Mindy calling Orson, come in, Orson.
Mindy calling Orson, come in, Orson.
Mindy calling Orson.
Yo, your space Mountainship!
Oh, that was a mistake.
I apologize.
I don't know where that came from.
I really didn't mean to say that.
You're excused.
When you're using Mork's mind, there's bound to be some ill effects.
Could you turn the heat up?
It's kind of cold in here.
Sorry, Mork's mind isn't equipped with a thermostat.
I told him to insulate.
Coffee.
Thank you.
So how's the family?
- Oh, they're just - Enough small talk.
Where's the application Mork promised to fill out?
Well For what?
I want Mearth's application for Ork Prep.
I sent it to Mork bleams ago and I haven't heard from him since.
Oh So that's why Mork was acting so strange at dinner.
And I thought it was the MSG.
What?
Never mind.
Um, Orson, I don't know how I feel about Mearth going away to school on Ork.
You'll love it.
He'll only go to school one day a month, Earth time.
- He'll commute.
- How?
Air Ork's H-28 transport beam has merged with Glibthansa and is now servicing the greater Earth area.
Well, uh, I'll discuss it with Mork and then we'll get back to you.
There will be no discussion.
The application will be completed and on my desk in the morning.
Thank you for the coffee.
It was delicious.
My secret is egg shells in the grounds.
You know, my grandmother used to do that.
Who cares?
Na-no, na-no.
Oh, uh, na-no, na-no to you too, sir.
Aha!
Sneaking around with Orson behind my brain?
What were you two doing?
Hmm?
Huh?
Hmm?
Oh, I know.
Wait a minute.
I'll take the positive approach.
You were planning a surprise party for me.
Okay, I'll play along.
Oh, no.
A belt sander.
You shouldn't have.
- Oh, honey, honey, honey.
- Mork.
"Pooter," little "pooter".
Oh.
I'm so surprised.
Just when I thought everybody had forgotten.
Mork, why didn't you tell me about the application to Ork Prep?
Does this mean there's no surprise party, Mind?
Oh, Mind, you know, well, preppies can be such snobs, Mind, you know, "Biffy, a Krugerrand seems to have fallen out of your loafer.
No.
Muffy, come here, chap.
Take that alligator off your shirt, it's been dead for a month now".
Mearth has to go to school.
And he's gotta be around kids like himself to be able to learn.
Yeah, Mind, but there's no substitute for experience.
I mean, look at me.
I know all the hosts of Real People.
Let's see, Skip Stephenson, John Barbour, Sara Purcell, and that black guy.
Why don't you want Mearth to go to school?
The truth of the matter is, Mind, he's growing up and he won't need me.
I mean, I should just go sit in the shed with his training wheels.
And that tire that he uses for a teething ring.
Mork, Mearth needs you now more than ever.
Look, you know all about Ork.
You can answer his questions.
And, anyway, it's only one day a month.
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
I feel a little self-indulgent recently.
I feel like Ronald Reagan at a budget meeting.
So, what do you say we get to that old application?
Well, can't it wait till the morning?
That's all right, just one little page anyway.
I hid it in Merv Griffin's autobiography.
I thought nobody'd ever look in here.
Hurry up, Mearth, you're gonna be late.
Oh, Mommy, Daddy, I'm all ready for school.
Look at me.
Yes.
Oh, I shined my shoes until they're almost silver.
I shaved my face so close so that other children can identify with me.
Oh, no, Mind, I can't take it.
It seems like he was hatched just yesterday.
Don't worry, Dad, I'll be home this afternoon.
Yeah, but that means I'll have to watch People's Court alone.
Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
We agreed there wasn't going to be a scene.
Oh, you're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.
Daddy was a little emotional, but he's over it now.
Like the time that he heard that Tom Snyder was quitting.
That's it.
There's the school beam now.
All right, son, you take care and you make me real proud of you.
Remember, at school you join the band, don't be the organ carrier.
Oh, they're hairy.
Here, sweetheart.
You have a good day, okay?
I'll see you when you get home.
Okay.
Gosh, well, Mommy, Daddy, I'm still here.
You might just be a big Oh, Mind, he's gone.
So is my couch, Mork.
What are you doing?
Would you believe it?
I'm cleaning my oven.
How are they biting?
Not too bad.
I had one little 5-foot Avon lady, but she got away.
Mork, just because the baby's gone away to school is no reason to go crazy.
All right, Mind, got a bite.
Wait.
Our mail.
Yay.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Maybe it's a letter from him.
- Oh, it's my Book of the Month Club.
- The Early Years.
Mork, do you realize how long it's been since we've been together alone?
Isn't there anything that you could think of that the two of us might do on a snowy afternoon?
We could have our second annual Punt, Pass and Kick competition.
Oh, yay, huzzah, he's returned!
Yo, my boy, my boy, my son, my son, my son.
Oh, huzzah, huzzah, it's him, it's him, it's him.
Mearth, what are you doing home?
There's five hours left of school.
I hate it there and I'm not going back there.
I hate it!
I'm not going back there.
I hate it!
I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.
Well, besides that, son, how was your day?
Mearth, will you stop saying, "I hate it, I hate it, I hate it," - and just tell us what happened?
- I hate it.
I do hate it.
The kids call me names and that teacher, Miss Geezba, oh, she's cruel.
I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.
Is she still alive?
Oh, I had Miss Geezba too.
Boy, Mind, I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.
This is not what I call a positive attitude.
Mind, you don't know Miss Geezba.
It's like saying disarmament to Alexander Haig.
Mearth, you know something?
I had teachers I didn't like too, but you know what?
They were usually the ones I learned the most from.
I just don't fit in any world.
This is just worse than being called Butchie, the dog-faced boy.
Oh, Mearth, sweetheart, don't you say that.
You're just the new kid in school and that's not easy.
Yeah, did you ever see Massacre at Central High?
You know what, Mearth?
I came home crying my first day at school too.
And I never would have gone back if my mom and dad hadn't taken me to class.
Tell you what, how would you feel about going back to Ork Prep if Daddy and I went with you?
Well, I'll see what Teddy says.
I only have trust in you.
Tell the truth, Teddy.
He says yes.
Good.
Well, the two of you have a nice time.
The three of us will have a nice time, Mork.
I'm sure Miss Geezba will be very happy with the way you turned out.
I don't think so, Mind.
Once on a field trip to the sun, she made me wear a coat.
- I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.
- I hate her, I hate her, I hate her.
Wow.
I've never had my molecules scattered all over the universe before.
- Am I all here?
- Well, yes, except you're bald.
Made you look, made you look, made you look, Mind.
Oh, Mind, I'm just so happy to be back at school again, I'm sorry.
- Hello.
- Mearth.
Young man, we do not leave the room without getting a hall pass.
Excuse me, sweetheart, I'm Mearth's mother.
Could you tell me where Miss Geezba is?
I'm Miss Geezba and don't talk down to me.
- Mork.
- Ma'am.
You still owe me a book report.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
The last one burned up on re-entry.
Oh, please don't do that.
I don't want to have lobes hanging down to my knees.
See, I told you that she was tougher than a rawhide chew stick.
I'm talking about you.
Mearth.
Miss Geezba Uh, Mearth came home very upset, and we were hoping we could talk to you about him adjusting to this environment.
See here, I've been a teacher for 43 bleams, and no one tells me how to run my classroom.
Now, I'm not trying to tell you how to run your business, you little It's just we were trying to make this a more positive experience for Mearth.
I'm sure everything will be fine once Mearth gets to know the other children and our alphabet.
You're welcome to observe as long as he behaves.
I hate her.
I hate her.
I hate her.
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?
She's the house of correction.
She is a mean, little, small person.
Oh, look, Mind, aren't they cute at this age?
Oh, Mearth, I missed you at recess.
I waited for you in the sandbox.
That's very nice.
He's already made little friends.
I have a feeling she's everybody's little friend.
Oh, Earth-head, Earth-head, listen, uh, I'm sorry I was mean to you this morning.
- That's okay, Ovits.
- Isn't that nice, Mearth?
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we shake and make up?
- You're not kidding me?
- Here's my hand.
Ovits's hand.
Fighting again, Mork?
Take your seat.
Yes, ma'am.
But did you see what that other kid did?
He No, I didn't.
And no one likes a tattletale.
Sit!
To hit a child.
To hit a child.
Sweetheart, you sit down and we'll be back there.
Mommy and Daddy, remember, no matter what happens, I still love you.
Listen, Earth-head, if you don't want old Geezba to call on you, when she asks a question, all you have to do is raise your hand.
Got it?
Raise your hand when she asks a question, - she won't pick on you.
- Can I be sure of this, Ovits?
What are friends for?
Class, can anyone tell me who invented the flying saucer?
Mearth?
- Well, Mearth?
- Benjamin Franklin.
Aretha Franklin.
That will be enough, class!
Don't worry.
Colleges are very expensive nowadays, anyway.
Let's begin Manilow appreciation.
Mommy, Daddy, you can't make me stay here.
Well, you can, but if you do, I'll hold my breath.
Mearth, don't you worry.
Mommy's gonna go talk to that little old pipsqueak.
Now, Mind, come on, we've gotta come down to Ork here.
You have never been the object of ridicule except for that time when you tried to play the Mikado.
Son, I know exactly how you feel.
See, when I was going to school, I was the one they made fun of.
Kids will make fun of you as long as you let them.
But if you've got pride in yourself, there's nothing that anyone can say.
That's right.
Hold your chin up high.
Then they can really deck you.
Do you have any idea what it's like sitting next to Ovits?
- Just ignore Ovits.
- I will.
Just ignore Ovits.
All right, class, that's enough Manilow.
We don't wanna get your blood sugar level too high.
Now, boys and girls, it's time for show and tell.
Who wants to go first?
I've got something I'd like to show Mearth.
Zelka, when you have something new to show, raise your hand.
Perhaps Mearth has something he'd like to share.
Well Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
Miss Geezba.
I guess first of all, most of you by this time know that I'm from Earth.
I have something that none of you have here on Ork.
None of you.
I have parents.
Parents?
What are those?
Well, Mommy and Daddy, come on down.
Listen, listen, what can parents do that a test tube don't?
Well, for instance, uh, you drop them, they don't break.
I'll tell you some other things.
First of all they, well, both of them brought me life and love.
Also, the one thing they don't let me do is barbecue in the bedroom.
That's bad.
But when I'm real good And I try to be most of the time, don't I?
- They always give me something like this.
- Wow, what is that?
- Oh, could I see that?
- What does it do?
- Excuse me.
- Well - This is small.
- This is a frog.
- A frog?
Yes, see, he's amphibious.
That's a very big word for me, amphibious.
That means he can swim in the water and he's also pretty good on the land.
And he eats flies, of course, has a long tongue, and also you find him in some of the better French restaurants.
And he goes: Excuse me, Earth-head, could I hold him?
If you let me hold him, I promise you, I won't hit you no more.
Okay.
You hold your hands real high.
- Like that?
- A little higher in the palms.
- Keep your palms up.
- Okay.
- That's right.
- Okay.
You know, I could really deck you right now.
But I won't.
Why?
Because I'm bigger than you are.
What a wonderful child I am.
Your little boy's going to be just fine.
- Oh, well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you for letting us observe.
- You're welcome.
- Stand up straight, Mork.
- Ma'am.
And don't forget that book report.
Yes, ma'am, I'd doing it on the Wit and Wisdom of Richard Nixon.
It'll be a one-page essay.
- Thank you for letting us observe.
- You're welcome.
You know something?
You handled that so well with Mearth.
- You're a good father.
- Oh, bless you, Mind.
We've got another hour until the next beam.
- How about we go shopping?
- Okay, that sounds like fun.
Good.
Maybe we can buy you a normal-size nose.
Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson, come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson, come in your Fat-Farmness.
- Mork.
- Sir.
- Good to see you.
- Oh, good to see you too, sir.
How's the little fella doing in school?
Well, I'm proud to say, sir, a lot better than I did.
- That's my godson.
- He is indeed, sir.
Today Ork Prep, tomorrow Ork Med.
Well, that's a very nice thought, but I'm not sure that'd be Mearth's choice.
I've learned that although it's good to encourage your child to shoot for the stars, it's not always good to choose which galaxy.
If it's up to parents, there'd be three jobs in the whole world: Doctor, lawyer and wholesale jeweler.
But don't you want Mearth to pursue a career you can be proud of?
Well, sir, that's not our decision.
We'll honor his choice, even if he wants to become a network executive.
Until next week, sir, na-no, na-no.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Na-no, na-no.
Hi, I'm home.
He's your son!
You go up there and talk to him!
- What?
- You're gonna get it now!
Your mother's home!
Don't make a face like that.
It might freeze that way.
And take that out of your mouth.
You don't know where it's been.
Mork, what ever happened to, "Hi, little pooter, big kiss"?
Oh, sure, think of yourself.
Think of yourself.
No one thinks about the poor, little house-maker, except for Richard Simmons.
Thighs, thighs, go away, send them all to Doris Day.
What are you so hysterical about?
Hysterical?
Moi?
Hm.
Your son is up there doing things that would embarrass the Turkish police.
Now, you You go upstairs and you beat some sense into him.
Ugh.
Oh!
Oh!
My head.
I can hear snails crawl.
Mork, I can't come home every day and be the villain.
You better take some responsibility too.
When there's a disciplinary problem, you're gonna have to learn how to handle it.
I guess you're right.
I'll just go talk some sense into him.
If he doesn't listen, I'll take him to a filling station and make him look at the men's room.
And if that doesn't work, hell, we could always buy him a pony - and own his soul for life.
- See, Mork, there's the problem.
You can't bounce from one extreme to the other like that.
Tell that to Eldridge Cleaver.
We're both new at parenthood, but we can't fall apart every time he misbehaves.
I mean, look, Mork, the key to being a good parent is consistency.
Do you understand?
No.
I also don't know why they make Häagen-Dazs ice cream in the Bronx.
Yo, you got some carob?
I want some carob.
Look, let's go upstairs and act like two calm, responsible parents, okay?
We can handle this Bowling?
I don't believe it.
Neither do I. That's a really tough split.
Son.
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, have I missed you.
Well, I missed you too, - sweetheart.
- Oh.
That's nice of you to say that.
- Your room is a mess.
- Mm.
You wanna tell me why you were bowling in the house?
Yes, it happened to be league night and all the lanes were spoken for.
Mr. Smarty Pants, you have an answer for everything, don't you?
Hm?
Ha-ha.
How about this one?
If the speed of light is 186,000 miles per second and the speed of a slug is one inch an hour, how long has Robert Conrad had that battery on his shoulder?
What are you talking about?
This is no time for brain teasers, Mork.
Go over there and reason with your son.
- Right, Mind.
- Consistency.
I remember that.
Don't worry.
I've seen Ordinary People twice.
Saw Popeye once.
- Son?
- Yeah.
Dad.
- It's a nice shirt.
- Mork.
Just warming him up.
Son, the real guts of the matter is that, well, how would you feel if you had any of your little friends over here and they saw this pigsty?
Easy.
This isn't West Point.
This is no white-glove inspection.
This is my lifestyle.
Wait a minute, you said something though, however.
You said something about having some friends over?
- That's what he said.
- Didn't he?
- Sure, and - How about even sleepover?
Well, Mearth, if you could prove to us that you're a responsible young man who takes a little pride in his possessions, then maybe we'll see.
- Me too?
- No.
- You think about what we said.
Okay.
- Sure will.
- Bye-bye, son.
- Bye, Dad.
You handled that like a real father.
- You did reason with him.
- Oh, thank you.
Let's talk about the bathroom, the pantyhose jungle.
You know, I think Just wondering, I've got to really clean this mess up so I can have some friends over.
Okay, here goes.
- Morning, little pooter.
- Mm.
You sleep well?
Oh, yeah, till about 3, when you took all the covers.
Well, actually I took them about 1, but you didn't notice.
And your little bones shaking helped me fall asleep.
Thank you.
Come here, I'll keep you warm.
There we go.
- Thanks.
- Come on.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Oh Good morning, good morning How we doing this morning?
Baby Mearth, your model child, is here Baby Mearth has fixed you breakfast, Mommy and Daddy.
Yes, that's so nice.
I haven't had breakfast in bed since I had my tonsils out.
Are you kidding?
How about this?
Banana for the lady?
No, sweetheart, thanks.
You've just been a little angel these last few days.
I sure try.
I really have.
I have.
- I've had something in mind too.
- Oh.
I want you to have the breakfast right here on your lap.
- Okay.
- You put that right down there.
Am I out of line, by any chance, in thinking that perhaps a reward is due me?
Mind?
Mind, be careful.
This is a setup for the pony.
No, no, not at all.
Not necessarily.
Remember, Mommy, per our little lecture, that I said if I cleaned up my room and I was good, and here I've served you breakfast and everything, that you might let me have some of my friends over?
Oh, sure, sweetheart, you can have some friends over.
Are you kidding?
Well, then, come on down, kids.
Well, Mommy and Daddy, allow me to introduce my classmates and schoolmates from Ork.
This is Zelka and this is Ovits.
- Na-no, na-no.
- Na-no.
- Na-no.
- Boy, this is really raznik.
Yeah, this is Earth, huh?
Heh.
And I thought Pluto was tacky.
Those kids are amazing.
We turn our backs for one second and they cloned the phone.
Look on the bright side though.
If we ever have a telethon, we're prepared.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Yes.
Yes, we have Prince Albert in a can and we did let him out already.
Ha-ha!
You're not gonna get me twice in one day!
- What was that?
- Sounded like a loud noise.
- Oh, dear.
- Are you kids okay?
Ovits zapped George's head.
- What happened, Mearth?
- He zapped his head off.
Where's his head now?
Well, it's somewhere over Denver.
- Ovits.
- Ovits, you're mean, mean, mean.
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- I'll tell you, Ovits, you are - Shut up, you wimp!
I'll get you.
- Okay, time-out.
Mork Mearth.
I thought Orkans were supposed to be non-violent.
Mearth, Ovits, I want you two to make up right now, or you're gonna spend the rest of the day in the corner.
I don't wanna.
I don't wanna.
- I don't wan - Ovits!
Okay.
Okay.
I am I am sorry I, uh I blew George's head off.
I was probably just suffering from beam lag.
Arg.
- I'm gonna tell you something - Mearth.
I was about to say it.
I want to tell you something, not to you, Mommy, ever.
But to you.
To you, you're hateful, mean, nasty, but, Ovits, you're fair.
Well, that's good.
Now shake.
That's better.
Oh, too bad.
It's time to go home.
There's the beam.
Goodbye, Mr. And Mrs. McConnell.
It has been a lovely visit.
Uh, you have a lovely home.
Mm - Goodbye.
- Y'all come back now, you hear?
- Na-no, na-no.
- Na-no.
- Zelka, you missed the beam.
- No, I didn't.
Mearth asked me to sleep over.
Come on, Mearth.
I wanna hear that new Olivia Newton-John record again.
- Let's Get Physical?
- Yeah.
It makes me crazy.
Zelka can't spend the night, can she?
Well, we gave our permission, Mind.
Remember, consistency.
I mean, come off it, Mind.
I mean, they're innocent, they're just kids.
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.
This aging reverse thing is just It's hard to get the hang of.
I keep forgetting that in their minds they're just babies.
Even though their bodies are anatomically correct.
When you think about it, you know, Mearth's just into snakes and snails - and puppy dog tails.
- And Miss January.
Cowabunga, Buffalo Bob.
Oh-ho-ho.
And look at that, sitting on a tractor too.
Oh, Mork, see what I mean?
I mean, we never know what he's gonna do next.
He's just growing up so fast.
But I'll tell you one thing, when boys start reading magazines like these, it's time for their father to have a little talk about the difference between boys and girls.
We've already worked that out.
I mean, I've told him that boys like to play sports and girls like to wear makeup, and if you're Alice Cooper, you can do both.
Like I said, we need to have a little talk.
Look, after Zelka leaves, the three of us are gonna sit down and have a discussion about the birds and the bees.
Well, all right, Mind, but I still say he's too young for this.
Mommy, let me ask you something.
Am I out of line in asking you for a stethoscope?
Well, sweetheart, I don't have a stethoscope.
Oh, guess I'll have to use my ear.
My son, the doctor.
Mork, we're gonna have to keep our eyes on those kids all night long.
We can't go upstairs right now, Mind.
We have to scrub up first.
He might be in surgery.
Well, isn't this fun?
Camping out in the living room all together?
Yeah, you get the best of both worlds.
You get that great outdoor feeling and that great indoor carpet.
What is happening here?
You tell me, what is happening here?
I mean, all I wanted to do was to take a hot bath with Zelka, and suddenly, we're the Wilderness Family.
Come on, kids, where's your pioneer spirit?
Come on.
We're sitting around the old Sterno.
We can swap stories and make stew, or we can swap stew and make stories, or we can all get stewed.
Does anybody have a good story they'd like to tell?
Hm?
Well, I've got this great story about the first time I baked raisin loaf.
Come on, Mind, that's a classic.
Arg, arg, arg, arg.
Oh, Mearth, I've got one.
I was at the Ork Farm milking a fring and this traveling salesman came along and asked me if I wanted to see what was in his sample case.
Would anyone like a soft drink?
No, thank you.
So I said no and he went away and I never saw him again.
- The end.
- Oh.
That's great, Zelka.
That's more plot than Kurt Vonnegut ever uses.
I think this is a perfect time for my raisin loaf story.
Oh, not yet, Mind.
You don't want to peak too soon.
Arg, arg, arg.
It'll slay you.
Well, come on now, kids.
Kids' game.
Tell you what.
How about this?
Let's pretend we're not even in the living room, but we'll use our imaginations and go to the deepest, darkest jungle, you know?
Now Larry, Aquarius.
Oh, now listen, look, animals everywhere.
Now come on.
Boy, if we can just keep a couple of these things for San Diego Zoo.
Come on now, son.
Son, you'll be the great white hunter.
Well, the reasonable white hunter.
And I'll be I'll be your faithful gun-bearer, Peba.
I will cut a way through the jungle.
All right.
Oh, good.
Forget that.
Oh, careful of the little feller.
Ah.
You've done a magnificent job.
What?
I'm sorry, your name again.
- Ibusay.
- Ibusay.
Yes, you changed in Nairobi.
It's all right.
Let's move along here.
Do you have a gun of any kind?
I don't want that machete.
Whatever you want, boss.
We got a telescopic sight here.
And if you get real close, we got a putter.
And if they get real close, you won't see me around here.
Let's get on with the animals.
Look!
One of them's charging now.
He doesn't even have credit.
Go ahead, go.
Shoot the sucker!
Shoot the sucker!
Shoot the sucker.
Get at it, get at it, get at it!
The animal has obviously got a thorn in its paw.
Give it a chance.
Good Lord.
Give me the small handgun.
Hold onto it.
Look at it.
Sometimes if you mock them, they hate it.
- Oh.
- There, that's just right for the living room.
- Carry on.
Hear, hear.
- Look, a snake!
- Where?
- A snake coming, boss!
Oh, it's got you now!
It's got you now, boss!
Oh, you're up for it now.
Wait, I'll spin you out of it.
It's got me now!
It's got me now.
- Look what it did - Look!
It's coming now.
Cream him!
What do I do with this snake?
Make it a boa.
Somebody'll wear it.
Well, ha, all right.
Approach him gently.
Give me that bazooka.
- I'm not going to fool around.
- All right, there it is!
Here's the shell coming in.
Ready?
Yes.
Gee Where's the bloody aspirin?
Well, boy, you hit me.
I thought it was a monkey had fallen on me.
Either that or just a pregnant baboon.
Well, they're almost there!
It's an elephant on Valium, so we got time.
All right, put a shell in it, quickly.
- I'll put another one in.
- Put one in quickly.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, boy, has that sucker got a kick.
Ooh, you done it now.
You've killed Marlin Perkins.
- Morning.
- Oh.
- Yeah, Mind.
Isn't this the life, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, no noise, no smog, no Underall commercials.
- No kids.
- Hm?
Where's Mearth and Zelka?
Let's get physical - Physical, physical - Physical, physical - Let's get physical - Let's get physical - My body says talk - Talk Mind, he's your son.
Good luck.
- What were you kids doing up there?
- Sleeping.
We couldn't sleep in the living room because there was so much noise.
Yeah, she's right.
You know, Mommy, even though you have a little bump of a nose, you snore loud.
Gee, Mearth, thanks for not letting me sleep alone.
Well, maybe he was just being a good host, Mind.
Oh, there's the beam, Zelka, you have to go home now.
Oh, gee, gee, Mr. And Mrs. McConnell, thank you for letting me stay over.
You have a great son!
I enjoyed him very much.
Boy, am I gonna miss you.
Ooh, am I gonna miss you.
See you back in school.
I get a chance to sleep over at your house.
Na-no.
Boy, I gotta tell you something, Mommy and Daddy, they gotta really work the kinks out of that beam.
I think we've postponed having our little talk long enough.
Yeah, you're right.
I guess I'm in the batter's box right now.
Mm-hm.
- Come along, son.
Surely.
Oh.
- Son?
- Yes.
Good training, remember it.
Son, ahem, that's another nice shirt you have there.
Strike one.
Mind, I think you're calling them a little close, aren't you?
All right, son, basically in this world, there are two types of people, let's just say male and female.
- Now, which is which?
- Oh, you learn that on the street.
And these male and female, they fall in love, and they register at Bloomingdale's, then they get married, and they try to marry up all their other single friends.
I don't know.
I like the raisin loaf story better.
- I think you left something out.
- Oh, yeah.
Well, sometimes they don't register.
They just ask for the cash.
I meant the part about how the babies get to be babies.
I don't think he's interested in that right now.
I am interested in that right now.
All right, um, son, um Ahem.
See, this, um And this No.
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
Mm.
Um Son Oh, boy.
You know, the only way I can really do this is a mind probe.
Yeah, that's it.
Well, here we go, son.
Hold on.
That's how babies are made.
That's how babies are made?
Wait a minute, Daddy.
What's that got to do with me?
Well, sweetheart, Zelka said you didn't sleep alone.
- Did she say that?
Mm-hm.
Well, she didn't sleep alone exactly.
I gave her my teddy bear.
So she slept with Teddy upstairs.
And as a matter of fact, I slept downstairs in your bed.
- Oh.
- You see?
And, incidentally, about your story, the time will come when I'll understand it.
Now, it's time for me to go.
- Sweetheart?
- Yes.
Um, if you don't understand Daddy's story, then why was that funny magazine in your pocket?
Heh.
- Remember?
- I remember.
Of course I remember.
As a matter of fact, that was in Mr. Bickley's garbage.
And, as a matter of fact, I was gonna make some, uh, paper airplanes out of it, but I thought better about that.
- I dismissed it.
- Oh.
I think I'd better get going right now, and I wanted to make the beds.
I really want to make them real good, you know, because next time around, I want to stay over at Zelka's.
Oh.
Sure did jump to conclusions, didn't we?
Zelka slept with his teddy.
Oh Yeah.
You know what the really hard part is now?
What?
I have to go tell a teddy bear the facts of life.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Cellulite Central.
Arg.
- Ah, Mork.
- Sir.
Just in time to play some Rack-Ork-Ball.
- Sir?
- I need to practice.
I'm playing in a celebrity tournament on the planet Fuca.
Well, what about my report, sir?
You can give your report while we play.
- Sir.
- Service!
Sir, this week my report is about parenthood.
Ha-ha-ha.
Again?
You know, Mork, I could use a little variety.
Well, sir, how about a little topspin on this one?
Lately, all you seem to talk about is raising your son.
Well, sir, it's a very tough job keeping the children of today from becoming the children of tomorrow.
- Out.
- Sir?
I beg to differ with you.
I think that was in.
I said out.
Well, ha-ha-ha, who am I to question one of your judgments?
Ha-ha-ha.
He'd never get away with this at Wimbledon.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Na-no, na-no.
Only my husband would buy out the entire airport gift shop in his own hometown.
Will you take off the silly hat?
You look like a character from Tumbleweeds.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mind.
I had to do something though.
I really miss our little bouncing baby-man.
I do too.
I'm gonna miss Mearth.
Oh, but it's good for him to be with Dad in Florida.
Just think, they'll camp out, sleep under the stars, swat mosquitoes.
Yeah.
Wait a minute.
- That's how Deliverance started.
- Heh.
It'll be a good experience for him.
Anyway, you know, we could really use the time together.
You think about it, Mork, the baby was born as soon as we got married.
We never had an opportunity to spend time together as just husband and wife.
I'm still gonna miss the little buggerpoo.
Yeah.
Sneaking around with his Polaroid, trying to take pictures of us - in compromising positions.
- Yeah.
Ha-ha.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I'm gonna miss waking up to, "Mommy, how come you look so different in the morning"?
And when I go to the park, who's gonna push me on the swing?
Boy, listen to us.
I think there's more to our marriage than just being parents.
Just think, we can spend a whole week together, just the two of us.
You got any ideas?
Well, there's an exciting new series on TV where the Osmond Family plays the Donner Party.
I think we can do better than sitting around watching television.
I really had something a little more exciting and exotic in mind.
Well, we could buy a parrot.
And teach it to talk dirty.
Mind, come on, I was kidding.
You know what I'm talking about.
I know we're a couple of vibrant young people that wear trendy clothes.
You know, the world belongs to us and the OPEC nations.
- You smooth talker, you.
- Mm Mm-hm-hm-hm.
- Mm.
- Aah!
Mork!
The telephone.
Mork.
Shh!
Stop it!
Hello.
Yes, this is Mindy.
Wait one second, please.
Mork, will you stop it?
Wait, I'll be off in a minute.
I'll be off in a minute.
Shh, shh, shh.
Hello?
Yes, I'm back.
Now?
Yeah, but what about Dewey Fishbeck?
Yes, sir.
Okay, I'll be right over.
Bye.
Oh, God.
Mork.
This isn't the way I wanted to start our week, but I've gotta go meet the camera crew.
A used car dealer's been kidnapped, and nobody wants to pay the ransom.
- Or cover the story.
- Oh, look, I understand, Mind.
Business before pleasure.
But don't worry, tonight when you come home, I'll give you Magic.
And if I can't get him, I'll get Kareem.
Ha.
Hello?
No.
You know the words to this song.
My boyfriend's back And there's gonna be trouble My boyfriend's back Mork, are the Arafats coming for bridge?
No, no, Mind, I would like to welcome you to the wonderful world of Middle-Eastern cuisine.
Welcome to Moroccafeller Center.
If you're very nice to me, I might be able to get you your passport back.
This is great.
Everything looks so Moroccan.
The pillows.
Your falafel outfit.
And the music.
Yes, I taped it off this great Middle-Eastern station, K-FEZ.
Talk about 16 with a bullet.
Gee, Mork, you went to all this trouble.
I feel like I should go to the river and do our laundry.
Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind, don't be afraid, because I have made you an incredible, original Moroccan meal.
Totally traditional because I went out and begged for the ingredients.
Sit down.
- There we go.
- This how I'm supposed to sit?
Well, that is if you're Yogi Berra.
"Yo, right in there".
We must begin, first of all, by the traditional washing of the hands, which is traditional in most Moroccan meals and some Moroccan surgery.
Dip your hands in there.
There we go.
- Feels like dishwashing liquid.
- It is, and you're soaking in it.
There we go.
There we go.
And now we must do the feet.
No.
I'm not gonna eat with my feet.
Oh.
Damn, there goes dessert.
- Mork, just sit down.
Let's talk.
- All right, my dear.
My little macaroon.
Mork, I love that you did this for me.
- Oh - You know Oh, we'll have time for some chat later, but first, I must serve you the first course, the traditional Moroccan appetizer.
Hold on and I will see, I will try to pronounce it for you.
Let's see if I can pronounce it.
Fruit cocktail.
What's Moroccan about that?
Well, when I opened the can, it went: A little Slim Whitman.
You're gonna love the next course.
Couscous and mahi-mahi.
I got the recipe from Lu-Lu in Walla Walla.
How she got the recipe, I'll never know-know-know.
Um, there's no silverware.
We're supposed to eat with our fingers?
Yes, because all the silverware is used in Morocco to tunnel out of prison.
First of all, you must take some of this.
And Be careful there.
Don't dip in the food.
You can dip, but don't dip.
Take a piece of this and take some And put some of that in there like this.
And then you savor the taste.
Ooh.
Heh-heh.
- Ooh.
- Mm.
It's so hard to get fresh camel lips in Boulder, Mind.
- Ooh.
- Oh - You know, Mork, I have a confession.
- What, Mind?
I was afraid that with Mearth gone we wouldn't have anything to talk about.
Oh, Mind, we'll have plenty of things to talk about, but after this.
- Oh, what?
- Ha-ha.
You'll see.
Oh.
- Who is that?
- Oh, sorry.
Fatima, Mindy.
Mindy, Fatima.
I would have gotten a snake-charmer, but his kid was having a Bar Mitzvah.
- Well, it's different.
- Oh, it is.
Not what I expected.
I think she wants to dance with you, Mind.
Uh, well, you go ahead.
My navel jewel's off being appraised.
It won't be the same effect without a halter top.
Ooh Oh.
Round two.
You and Fatima chat.
Maybe you can ask where she got these wonderful clothes.
You dance really well.
You know, Casablanca was my favorite film.
Specialty of the house, - the shish kebab.
- Oh, Mork.
Or in the very elegant restaurants, "shish ke-Robert".
Since the beginning, we must have some more spices, a little brandy there.
Mm-mm-mm.
You can never have too much of this on there, huh?
Yeah, now, wait a minute.
Is that supposed to be on fire?
Well, it's kind of academic, Mind, because it is now.
- Looks kind of hot.
- Well, don't panic.
I know how to deal with this.
Don't panic at all.
Fire!
Fire!
Mind, Mind.
Mind, Mind.
Oh, don't make a mess, hon.
There.
Well - It's all right now.
- Yeah, it's all right.
Next time, you schlep to Moroccan Town and barter with the man with one tooth going, "You must buy this.
You must buy this".
Oh.
Oh.
I'm sorry I ruined our perfect evening, Mind.
I'm just tragedy's pawn.
I feel like an outer space Eddie Fisher.
Oh, Mork, it was no tragedy.
Nobody was hurt.
You call burning up lamb at $9 a pound no tragedy?
Believe me, there are worse things in life.
I'm glad you feel that way, Mindy, because I think Fatima danced out of here with our toaster oven.
Oh, Mork, I love what you tried to do.
- But now the fire's out, - Uh-huh.
- And Fatima's out, - Mm.
And we're alone.
Ah, you're right.
We don't need external stimuli.
We can make our own chemistry, huh?
We'll have our own little Fourth of July without the vandalism.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Hm.
You know that something Oh, no, you go Oh.
Oh.
Oh - Oh, no, go ahead.
- Oh, no, you.
I insist.
Well, all right, I'll go.
You know, there's something that's been bugging me - ever since I landed on Earth.
- What?
You know that song "This Old Man"?
When he hits 12, what's he play knick-knack on?
You actually wonder about things like that?
You know when you get a song in your head Boing, boing, boing, boing.
- I don't know.
- Oh.
Well, me too.
Yeah.
Catchy song, isn't it?
Oh.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
- Ow, this is great!
- Great?
We haven't said a word.
No, look, I found a bicentennial quarter.
- That's wonderful, Mind.
- Oh, Mork, this is silly.
Look at us.
We're as uncomfortable as a pair of teenagers on a blind date.
We must have something to talk about.
Well, what do you want me to say, Mind?
Well, I don't know.
Anything.
Ask me how work was.
All right, how was work?
Somebody parked in my parking place today.
Boy, that's life in the big city, huh?
Want me to ask how your lunch was?
Oh, no.
You're not supposed to have to ask what to ask.
- We're having a conversation.
- Oh, no, Mind.
I mean, besides, I didn't know I have to ask what I have to ask when I don't know what I wanna ask when I wanna ask it.
So now you're getting defensive?
I'm not getting defensive.
You're out of line.
Mork, what's wrong with a husband and wife trying to have a conversation?
I mean, look, our lives have been moving so fast.
We haven't had a chance to talk about hardly anything.
- Like what?
- Well, like All right, for example, you've never said whether you like being married or not.
- I do.
- Well, why?
- Well, lots of reasons.
- Well, give me one.
Well, all right.
- The bed's warmer.
- Oh, that's it.
Mind, if you wanted snappy repartee, you should have married William F. Buckley.
"I find the institution of marriage quite appealing".
I'm sorry, Mork.
I love you.
Well, why?
Okay.
Well, because you're warm and sensitive and unpredictable.
And you're right, the bed is warmer.
Now, don't you have something you'd like to say to me?
- Yes.
- What?
You have a big piece of couscous in your teeth.
Can't you be serious for a minute?
I just opened up to you.
- Can't you tell me how you feel?
- Oh, you already know that.
- I'd like to hear it.
- I'm sure you would.
Probably right now, maybe?
Oh, okay, just give me a micro-bleam here.
It's just a Shelf!
- Shelf?
- That's it, Mind.
This old man, he plays 12 He hits knick-knack on my shelf All right, that's it.
Just forget it.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up.
Oh, who is not communicating now, Miss Marshall McLuhan?
Well, what's the point in communicating with someone - who's got nothing to say?
- Oh, maybe I would if I wasn't being interrogated by the Boulder Gestapo.
- Gestapo?
- Yeah, and I haven't even started yet.
Well, you've got a lot of nerve calling me names, space boy.
Oh, to the moon, Alice!
Well, I've got something I'd like to say to you.
Shiksa!
Oh, if you think Oh, Mind?
I've cooled off now, hon.
I'm really cooled off now, hon, because I'm locked out.
Honey?
Little pooterama?
Ha-ha-ha.
Fun's fun, hon.
The bed's not gonna be as warm.
Be careful.
There you go.
Come on, couple more steps.
Watch out there.
There we go.
You look like you're on What's My Line?
Come on.
No, no, that's all right.
Now, take one step up.
Take a step up.
There we go, one step up.
Now, when you open your eyes, you're not gonna be mad at me anymore.
Yeah?
Well, we'd better be in Paris.
Well, take one step forward, two steps to the left, and you're gonna be at the greatest place on earth, next to Burt Reynolds' Dinner Theatre in Jupiter, Florida.
- Where are we?
- Come on, Mind, what are you, blind?
Oh.
Sorry.
Boy, Mind, how about this for a blast from the past, huh?
Well, don't you know where we are?
Well, wait.
Okay, imagine there are no walls here, the snow has melted, and there are beer cans over there - shimmering in the full moon.
- Mork, where are we?
All right, I'll give you another hint.
Sounds like the place we first met.
- Here?
- No, no, here.
There was a rock that says, "Chi-Chi Loves Lumpy".
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, now I remember.
- Yeah.
You had your suit on backwards.
Yeah, I almost choked to death trying to tie the tie.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I thought you were a priest.
- Yeah.
I was just glad that your mouth was on your face.
Oh, Mind, I feel a sudden flood of emotions.
I feel just like a salmon.
Oh Why don't you take a picture?
It lasts longer.
Okay?
Yo!
Yaddy-yaddy-yadda.
- Roofers.
Heh.
- Yeah.
Mork, thanks for the sentimental journey to the past, but let's go home.
Oh, no, we can't leave.
I mean, it's too important.
We don't wanna end up like the League of Nations.
Mork, you can't honestly believe that just by coming back to a place like this, - it can change anything.
- Oh, yes, I do.
Knock it off, for crying out loud!
Show some decorum around here.
Shut up!
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry, folks.
Please, I apologize.
Try to excuse the fellas.
It's just that they're not romantics, you know, like myself.
Just last week, I, uh I bought my wife a cappuccino machine.
Oh, we didn't mean to barge in.
In fact, we were just leaving.
Oh, you're not the couple that's buying this place?
- No.
- On her salary?
Are you kidding?
Heh.
Arg, arg.
Looky-loos, huh?
No, actually, this is the place where we first met when it was all still wilderness.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- But we are just gonna be on our way.
- Leave?
No!
You can't leave now and ruin this beautiful warm moment.
No, no, no.
I won't hear of it.
But we do have a little bit of an insurance problem here.
Hey, Luke, give me a couple of hard hats down here.
One for you, pal.
There we go.
One for the lady.
Mam'selle, here you are.
I might say you look divine in green.
Come on now, tell me, how did you two meet?
Oh, well, you know, typical stuff, boy meets girl Come on, you can tell me.
We're like old friends now.
- No, I don't wanna.
It's dumb.
- No, it's not, Mind.
Well, you see, she was out with this creep and then he dumped her - and he took off in her jeep.
- That's not true.
He I happened to dump him.
He just took my jeep.
See, that's the part where I came in.
I was sent to Earth to observe, and my eggship landed, well, about 40 feet over there.
Then I came out with my suit on backwards and I said: And then I met her and, you know, then we started living together and we recently got married and a month ago my son was just hatched.
- Oh-ho-ho.
- That's nothing.
You wanna hear a real story?
I just wanna tell you how I first met Mitzi.
All right?
I was at Petaluma, right?
You know, for the arm-wrestling tournaments.
Turned around one day and there she was, Mitzi.
Like a vision, like a Venus de Milo in a Harley-Davidson T-shirt.
And she pinned that other chick in five seconds flat.
Broke her wrist.
Heh.
That's a beautiful story.
Sure beats the sap out of mine.
I gotta get back to work.
Listen, you kids stay here as long as you want.
You understand?
You know, enjoy yourself.
Okay, bye.
I might just go two out of three with Mitzi tonight.
She'll let me win.
She always does.
She's crazy about me.
Well, who wouldn't be?
Ha-ha-ha.
How could you tell a total stranger where you're really from?
Oh, Mind, loose-lips moi.
I'm so muddled and confused recently, I feel like a Vietnamese child adopted by a Southern family.
I know, I've been feeling badly too.
I just can't seem to make things get together for us, Mind.
I mean, what am I doing wrong?
I don't know, Mork.
If I did, I'd tell you.
You know how to do origami and you don't know how to do this?
I wonder what makes it so hard.
Well, if you think about it, it was never easy.
I mean, once you shrunk to the size of a beer nut.
I've been cloned, and on our wedding day, Orson turned you into a dog.
We've been through almost as much as Loretta Lynn before her sweet 16 party.
If we can get through that, why can't we get through this?
I don't know.
It seems like since we've gotten married, everything seems so much more important.
- Even our failures.
- Oh, Mind, we're not failing.
I know what failure means.
I tried to argue with the phone company about a bill once.
You ever been on hold for a day?
Well, I guess we can't expect to know all the answers.
Just because we're married, we think we're supposed to.
Yeah.
When I thought we were gonna be alone again, boy, did I panic.
I know, but at least you tried.
I just pushed.
I got so uncomfortable.
I kept trying to make you say things I wanted to hear.
- That isn't us.
- Yeah.
But this is us, isn't it, huh?
Oh, Mork, we've got so much going for us.
We don't need to have exotic dinners or pull crazy stunts to prove that we love each other.
Yeah, I guess you're right, Mind.
Eh.
Ah.
Won't be needing these.
Oh, there we go.
Oh, Mork, I love you.
Oh, I love you too, Mind.
And now I finally can say why.
And you look great naked!
- Thank you.
- Oh, now, Mind, you know, relating has its place, but you know what's really nice?
Well, it's to sit here, hold hands, - watch the sun set over the wet bar.
- Heh-heh.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Come on, kiss her already.
It's almost Miller time!
Aw!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Na-no, na-no.
Well, I guess that's all the time we have for today.
I'd like to thank my guests, Mary Snyder, the author of the best-seller I Bet You'll Ban Nuclear Energy After Your Hair and Teeth Fall Out, and also our local Rubik's Cube expert, Tommy Nesbitt.
Thank you, Tommy, it's been a wonderful week.
And as Wake Up, Boulder completes its first week on the air, I'd like to thank someone who exhibited a great deal of faith in this program and in my career, our general manager Miles Sternhagen.
And so this is Mindy McConnell signing off for now, wishing you blue skies and green lights.
Don't just sit there, shake hands.
Pretend you just heard something funny.
And we're out.
Well, it was nice of you to say all those things about Sternhagen.
I'm sure it'll be a real comfort to him.
Why?
What's wrong?
Is he sick?
This show ought to be called Wake Up, Mindy.
- Sternhagen's out, he's been axed.
- You're kidding!
No, we got us a new boss.
So you just polished the wrong guy's apple.
He's such a jerk.
I did it!
Turn on the cameras!
I'm finished!
Yeah?
You're not the only one.
All aboard for the McConnell Express, now leaving for Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga.
Oh, Pops, it's perfect in every detail.
Look at that.
Little people, little horses.
All you're missing is a robber baron and exploited Chinese labor going, "I got to get to San Francisco".
Daddy, Daddy, can I be the engineer?
Can I, can I, can I?
Mearth Mearth, I think you just better watch me for a while so you can get the hang of it.
You know, I gave these trains to Mindy over 20 years ago, but she wasn't interested in any toy that didn't cry or wet or have a best friend named Midge.
You know something, Grandpops?
That was a very moving, nostalgic speech.
Now, fork over the controls!
Oh, no!
What a bummer!
Oh.
Hey, Mearth, it's okay.
Oh, Mearth, Mearth, it's all right.
It's just a few loose connections on the transformer.
It's old and it doesn't work very well.
You understand, son, like the Nielsen ratings.
Hi.
You'll never guess what happened.
- They fired Sternhagen.
- Hi, hon.
Big kiss.
Hold it!
Come on now, fork over those controls!
Put all the coal in the bag and start shoveling the money in the fire.
Stop that, Daddy!
Stop it.
We're playing trains, and I'm brand-new to this.
You mustn't be a robber all the time and do that.
Come on, let me get used to playing with the train.
Come on now.
Come on, son, you had your chance and you blew it really big.
- Now, come on.
- Hey, is anybody listening to me?
I mean, I think my career is more important than playing with trains.
Mind, the 5:15's coming down the line.
If no one throws the switch, Zeke's not gonna get his mail-order bride named Gilda.
Will you turn that thing off just for a minute?
Uh, we're sorry, sweetheart.
You're absolutely right.
Tell us what happened.
Right, Mork?
Of course.
I should be the dutiful husband.
Besides, Zeke sent her a phony picture anyway.
Mommy, I'd really like to help you, but my hands are tied because I have to experience this railroad stuff.
I understand, sweetheart.
Anyway, they fired Sternhagen.
They just tossed him out on his heel without a word.
Is there nothing sacred?
First The Ropers, now Miles Sternhagen.
Mork.
See, Sternhagen hired me.
I mean, he gave me my shot at my own show.
Now I don't know what's gonna happen.
Oh, honey, you're very good.
What you do on your own is very good.
You'll be just fine without him.
Mearth, don't you tie that little family to the tracks!
Oh, come on!
Are you kidding, Grandpops?
They're only rubber.
Oh, come here, my little breadwinner.
Come on.
You're upset.
You have to remember that the darkest is always about 3 a.m. Yeah, but, Mork, if you'd heard the plug I gave Sternhagen on the air today.
I don't know, if the new boss heard it, I could lose my job.
Oh, well, that could be a problem.
If you're out of work, I mean, who's gonna pay for the food, the rent, the bills, and those little smoke pellets for the engine over there?
- All aboard!
Head them up!
- Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Good.
The way I see it, if you work hard and do a good job, - they'll always keep you around.
- Oh, yeah, you're right.
I'm really not that worried.
How's my hair?
Do I have on too much lip gloss?
- No, you look fine.
- Okay.
Mindy, what are you so uptight about?
So this guy Pierson is a hotshot with a published thesis on programming.
He's barely out of college.
And besides, I'm safe in sportscasting.
There's always a stink when they fire a minority.
Oh, I'm really not that insecure.
I mean, after all, Boulder does have to wake up in the morning, right?
But not with you.
Ahem.
Here comes our new boss.
The one wearing the retainer.
That's Pierson?
He looks more like the general manager of a McDonald's.
- I think he's kind of cute.
- Who cares?
You know how I've lasted so long?
I've always kept my self-respect.
Never kowtowed to any of them.
Excuse me.
How do you do there, Mr. Pierson?
Jake Loomis, cameraman.
- Pleasure.
- Yeah, nice suit there.
You know, I've been with the station for 29 years now.
I've got all the inside dirt on everybody.
Jake, in all the world there's nothing sadder than an old fink.
- You're fired.
- Oh, fine, great.
Well, let me tell you.
You're gonna meet the same people on your way down as you did on your way up!
Sonny!
Poor Jake.
I feel sorry for him.
- And I don't even like him.
- Yeah, me too.
I wonder if I can get his parking space.
May I have your attention, please?
Thank you.
I am Daniel Pierson, your new general manager.
Now, first of all, I would like to put an end to the rumor that people are going to be fired.
That is not a rumor.
That is a fact.
Tonight, I am planning an informal but mandatory get-together here at the station, to share some of my ideas and get to know your families better.
So I want to make KTNS the place to be.
At least, for some of us.
Well, let's all try to keep in touch, okay?
- Sure, Mindy.
- Yeah.
Mr. Pierson.
Stan Jackson, sports at 6 and 10.
- Pleasure.
- Ooh, hey.
Wow.
What a grip you got there.
You know, you'd look great in a Broncos jacket.
Oh, there's something I'd like to remind you of, I'm black.
Hi, I'm Judi, your weather person.
I'd like to welcome you with a big KTNS warm front.
Heh.
How sweet.
Heh.
She's very sweet.
There's more where that came from.
Mind.
Mind, Mind, am I glad I caught up with you, hon.
Hon, I've got an important telegram from a major news network in New York.
- Mork, don't do this to me.
- Read it, hon?
I have to sing it!
Five, six, seven, eight.
We're looking for a newscaster One who speaks quite well And who doesn't wear a toupee Like Howard Cosell And if you've been through college Please join our team Signed Roone Arledge Mindy, is your parking space any closer than Jake's?
Mr. Pierson, that was just a little joke.
I'm Mindy McConnell, employee, for now.
Ha-ha.
This is my husband Mork.
He was just kidding around.
He's a little nervous about my job.
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.
- Oh, Mindy, please, don't apologize.
I want you to know that I appreciate family concern.
Well, just this morning my mom called me to make sure that I had dressed warm.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Oh, ha-ha.
Well, Oedipus schmedipus, Mindy really loves mama's boys.
Oh, Mindy, I just love his sense of humor.
You be sure to bring him to the party tonight.
I bet he can give me a couple of pointers - on where young people are at.
- Oh, I will.
- For sure.
- I will.
Don't you have to be leaving now, honey?
- No.
- Think again.
You're right.
I should go home and wait by the phone for those calls that are gonna come pouring in, babe.
Sweetheart, I'm gonna do for you what Alan Hamel did for Suzanne Sommers.
I think you already did.
- Well, you tell a friend.
- Heh.
Oh, no!
No!
The train is stopped!
You bad engineer.
Daddy, come in here, please, and make it work.
Please.
Oh, what's wrong, son?
Oh, where's that happy face I know so well?
"Where's that happy face I know so well"?
If you wanna see a happy face, go see Annie.
If you wanna see my face, see this.
- Oh, little bulldog boy, no!
- Aargh.
Come on now, I'll fix the trains and I'll make them run better than Mussolini ever did, now come on.
Just tighten this little doohickey here, this little doohickey there.
Ha-ha!
And voilà, it's fixed!
Mr. Goodwrench, move over.
All right, now You know something, Daddy?
You're truly a superior being.
Oh, shucks, son.
Let's play this one together.
Ready?
- Daddy?
- Yes, son?
Why am I talking to you and looking at me?
Holy shazbot!
Wait, don't panic.
There's an explanation for this.
There's always an explanation for everything.
The only thing I can't explain is this.
Why is it that Bob Hope is still doing commercials?
Everything was fine until Don't do that.
- Hey, Mork, are you there?
- I'll go.
Can you open the door?
My hands are full.
It's your mother.
Now, try to relax.
Relax and pretend nothing happened, you understand?
It'll put her uptight, so just relax and just - No, no.
No, no, no!
- Cut, cut!
No!
Stop it!
What's going on here?
Little pooter.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
Big kiss, big kiss.
- What did you say, Mearth?
- I didn't say anything, Mommy.
Oh, you stoolie.
Crossed minds.
I got a little taller, huh?
Right?
Did I do good?
Why me?
You transferred minds through a train set?
This is like a bad horror movie, only I'm married to the mad scientist.
Mind, wrong body.
I'm over here.
Oh, right.
- Um, well, how long is this gonna last?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe 24 hours, We gotta get to that party where they have little crackers.
Let's go.
- Mearth, look - Yes, Mommy.
Um Mearth, go upstairs to your bedroom while your father and I have a little talk.
Oh.
So that's the way it is.
He's in and I'm out.
You've asked for it once again, Butchie returns.
I'll tell you something, son, once and for all.
Don't do that.
Your face will freeze.
No!
No.
Who cares?
Who cares anyway?
It's not my body.
Ooh, you're a joke!
I'm hip.
- Okay, okay, Mind.
- Mork, sit down.
I'm ready, ready, kay-o.
Kay-o, kay-o.
Going to the party.
It's late, and we ought to get to the party - as soon as we can, that's all.
- Go to the party?
Mork, I can't take you to the party with that face.
Little pooter.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
About this face, I wanna make something clear, just as clear as your complexion.
Okay?
Chances are the boss is gonna come over to look at Mork, right?
Then take my body, please.
My job is hanging by a thread as it is.
I can't take Mearth to the party.
He's just a child.
That's true, but I'll tell you something.
He's half a superior being, remember that?
He'll be almost as good as I would have been.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Call this a party?
Where's the cake and the little party hats and the pushy father with the camera going, "Stay by the bull, stay by the bull"?
No!
Mork Mearth.
Mearth, remember, my job is at stake.
Now remember our agreement.
If you're a good boy and you don't embarrass Mommy, then I'll give you that note to get out of gym.
- I'll try and act like an adult, Mommy.
- Okay.
Good boy.
I think Mommy should do all the talking, so shh.
Jake.
Well, I'm glad to see you're back.
Stuffed mushroom, Mindy?
Boy, are you older than dirt.
Give me a break.
Ain't I had enough for one day?
Uh, no, thank you, but I'm glad to see you're working again.
Yeah, well, this is just temporary.
I'm gonna ask Pierson for my job back tonight.
If he says no, I'm gonna kill him.
Good evening, everyone!
Hey, thanks for coming.
And now, I would like to introduce you to the future of KTNS.
Ju Ju.
Now, this is our morning schedule.
You will notice that the only major change is the removal of Wake Up, Boulder and Kartoon Karnival in place of our morning movie.
So, Mindy, Skipper Bill, you're out.
Don't worry, Mindy, he's dead.
Now, I am planning a powerhouse opening for the new season.
To kick off the Monday movie, you can look forward to Ben Gazzara week.
So let's all pull together and make KTNS the biggest little independent station in Boulder.
Mr. Pierson, I think you've made a mistake.
And I'm not just saying this because I am the host of the show, but I really believe that Wake Up, Boulder is an important, vital program and really performs a service to this community.
Look, Mindy, it's essential that you know that what I've done has nothing to do with you personally.
- It is strict economics.
- Well - You know, I like the Road Runner.
- Excuse me?
- Not now, not now.
- No, no, Mindy, let him talk.
I like to hear what the general public has to say.
Oh, maybe not.
Heh.
Well, I like the way the Road Runner goes beep-beep.
And then I go beep-beep.
Are you saying that a grown man like yourself watches cartoons every morning?
Yes, I've seen Popeye 14 times.
And if you run it backwards, it has an ending.
But, you know basically, what I really like is, like, when the coyote paints a tunnel on the side of a mountain and then the Road Runner just goes, vroom, right through the tunnel and then when the coyote tries to go through, vroom, boom, he becomes two-dimensional.
I think I think what Mork is trying to say is that he appreciates an altered sense of reality.
You know, something that contrasts the drabness of everyday life.
I knew that.
However, Mindy, I want you to know that my morning movie will accomplish the very same thing.
Bummer, this is not real.
What does he mean by that?
You don't know?
Well, heh, of course I know.
It's just a simple, um, metaphorical approach to saying that movies can only simulate reality, while cartoons, by virtue of their being so totally unreal, create their own level of reality, so therefore, ergo, it only follows that all that which is real is that which is completely unreal.
Oh, I think I touched on that in my thesis.
Oh, those are real.
Oh, that's brilliant!
Reality is direct personal experience.
Oh, Mindy, I had no idea that your husband was so perceptive about our medium.
Neither did I. Heh.
I want more, though.
I'm still hungry.
- Mm.
Of course, you're still hungry.
- Unfulfilled.
- Mm, unfulfilled.
- You got it.
You are still hungry because TV menus are limited these days, which is why people are hungry for knowledge and the exchange of ideas.
Right, Mindy?
Right.
Right.
And it's up to our programming to be able to relay to the public information that will help feed that hunger.
Like a talk show!
- What a great idea.
Hm-hm.
Yes, something really different.
I will call it Wake No, I will call it I will call it Stop Sleeping, Boulder.
Finally, something good.
Oh, it is, isn't it?
Gosh, I love this business.
Well, now, all I need is the perfect host to make it work.
Oh.
Oh, look, pretty, right under my nose.
Right again, Mork.
What we need is someone who can exude intelligence, warmth and grace.
- Mindy?
- Yes.
- Until we find somebody, you're it.
- Oh, thank you.
Sure.
Well, I've just created my first show.
Ha-ha.
Gosh, now I know how God and Norman Lear felt.
- Mearth?
- Mm?
You are an amazing little boy.
You got Mommy back her job.
At least temporarily.
- I'm very proud of you, sweetheart.
- Thank you, Mommy.
But can we go home right now?
Daddy's shorts are really riding up on me.
I'm talking major snuggy here.
Come on.
Okay.
Fire one.
Now, Mearth I mean Mork, are you sure this reverse energy process will work?
Well, as they say in French: - Maybe.
- Well, now, let's just keep a positive attitude.
I mean, it always worked in Frankenstein.
Honey, I know this hasn't been easy for you, - but at least you got your show back.
- Yeah, that's true.
Actually, Pierson turned out not to be such a bad kid after all.
He even gave Jake his job back, after the bomb squad left.
I was glad to use your body.
I'm sorry I didn't wash it before I gave it back to you.
Well, here goes.
Oh, great, Dad!
Great.
You should work for the Defense Department.
Oh, no, no, no.
Look, you just You forgot to plug it in.
Oh.
- Oh.
Little pooter, I'm back.
- Oh.
Come here.
Mm.
Oh Well, everything is back to normal again.
I'm certainly happy for you kids.
I guess I'd better get Get off to rehearsal.
Major bummer.
This is worse.
Now I'm bald.
Look out.
Here comes the face.
Mind, now come on, don't worry.
We'll switch them back, and after that, maybe you and I can switch.
I've always wanted to be whistled at by construction workers.
Oh!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Na-no, na-no.
Hi, I'm home.
Ah, Mork, Mearth, I'm home from work.
What a day.
No, no, no, you keep your coat on, Mind, because if we really haul rubber right now, we can get downtown, we can go to the grocery store, the hardware store.
I've saved up enough coupons to buy a small Learjet.
Now, come on.
Mork, I just got home from work.
I don't wanna run out the door again.
Come on, there's gotta be something in this house we can eat.
Oh, we just have that cheese that the president sent us.
Mearth, Mearth, come on, son.
Move it, let's go.
I'm moving.
My clothes are standing still.
Hi, sweetheart.
I know you're in there somewhere.
Whoa.
Neat.
Hey, listen, Mommy, can you get someplace where there's air conditioning?
Sweetheart.
Just give me a minute to catch my breath, Mork.
I just walked in the door.
Oh, hon.
Now, poor little, pooped-out pooter, don't worry.
Come on, you just sit down here and we'll make you feel so much better.
- Mm-hm.
- That's nice.
Yes.
- Now we feel better, don't we?
- Mm-hm.
Mm, good.
Now let's haul tush.
Come on, let's go.
Mork, every time I come home, I've gotta turn around and run out the door again.
There's gotta be some way you can handle these errands during the day.
Mind, Mind, Mind, it's not that easy.
- Well - It isn't.
Come on, you guys, are you gonna go or aren't you?
- No.
- Yes.
Are you or aren't you?
You know, I tell you something both.
I'm beginning to sweat as much as Orson Welles chasing a Frisbee.
Right, we forgot about you under there.
Here, let me help you.
Well, Daddy sure kept you warm, didn't he?
I don't believe it.
I feel, Mommy, like a Some kind of huge artichoke and it's just You're de-leafing me.
Or debriefing me.
Whichever.
Mork, you know it would be a lot easier for all of us if you would learn how to drive.
You want me to drive some primitive vehicle financed by the government?
Come on now.
Mind, it'd be like asking the great Pelé to play soccer with a bee-bee.
Mork, look at it this way.
What if something happened to Mearth during the day, like a real emergency, what would you do?
Well, I'd do what I always do, fall apart.
Wouldn't it be a lot simpler if you learned how to drive a car?
I mean, really, Mork, it's a snap.
Like in some parts of the country, you can get your license at 14.
Oh, the same parts of the country where they marry at 8.
Listen, you two, I'm gonna tell you something, gently.
I've had it right up to say here.
Okay?
I'm going into the bedroom.
If I'm not called for dinner within an hour, remember this, I can get awfully cranky.
Think about it.
Oh, Mork, have it your way.
But I'll tell you, I think it's a shame.
If you had your license, just think, you could drive those 6 long miles to the arcade and play "Pac-Man".
But if you wanna stand on the curb sniffing at life's exhaust, that's your prerogative.
- I'm Stirling Moss.
- And I'll be Jackie Stewart.
Great, great, great.
Gonna be great today.
There we go.
Oh, I forgot to start mine.
How silly.
Don't touch the automobile.
It'll be cursed.
Oh, I forgot to wear my goggles.
These flies are hitting my eyes.
All right, enough's enough.
Okay.
All right, now, Mearth, Mommy's gonna ask you to do a big favor, and that's help me teach Daddy how to drive, okay?
And that means, shh, be quiet.
That's great.
- Oh, come on.
- You pay attention.
Okay, now My understanding was, that this was gonna be a lot of family fun.
Well, no, Mearth, we're not on a family trip.
We're just gonna sit in the car.
Well, then we're very much overly packed.
Okay, Mork.
Now You gave it to me.
Okay.
You've seen me drive before, all right?
- Mommy.
- Hm?
Are we there yet?
Sweetheart, I told you, we're not going anywhere.
We're sitting in the garage.
But why don't you pretend we're going on a family trip, okay?
Okay.
But that's what I mean.
Are we there yet?
Almost.
Ready?
All right, now, this is the ignition.
To start the engine, you put your key in and turn it.
Key.
That means I'll need a key chain.
Oh, Mind, that's wonderful, because maybe I can get one with a cowboy boot on the end.
Or one with a piece of Tupperware, or one with a bagel that says: "Nosh, nosh, who's there"?
Mork, forget the key chain, it's not important, okay?
Are you kidding, Mind?
Style is everything to me.
Okay, back on the track.
Now, this is a standard transmission.
That means you have to change the gears by using the gearshift.
Ooh, so that's what that's for.
Yeah.
What'd you think it was for, churning butter?
It doesn't really matter what I thought.
Oh.
Okay, now, what you do to do that, you take your foot off the gas and depress the clutch.
Depress the clutch.
Clutch, have you ever seen the movie Brian's Song?
How about that last Ali fight, huh?
Mommy, Mommy.
- What, Mearth?
- Mommy, I'm getting car sick.
- No.
- I am, I am, I am.
You know, sweetheart, so am I. You know, I have come to the realization that I don't have the ability to teach you how to drive.
In fact, I know for sure I don't have the patience.
I think you should go to a driving school.
- Does that mean the lesson's over?
- Yes.
- You know what that means, son?
- Yes, I do.
Back to the Grand Prix, eh?
Oh, what a day Let me say When you drive in your way You can say No, I'm not coming into the pits now!
I'm not coming into the pits!
No, don't touch my arm!
- Aah!
- Oh, let my arm go!
Let my arm!
- They got my arm!
He's got my arm!
- What is?
Forget that.
Oh, let it alone!
Agh!
Oh, the police are following us.
- There's the queen.
- Oh, well, hello.
- The regular queen.
- Hello, hello, hello.
Hello, queen.
Ha, ha!
As I live and breathe, Todd Norman Taylor.
TNT, that's my initials and my lifestyle, a megaton of fun and a pretty fair limbo dancer.
Ow!
Hey, where's my hug?
We're a couple of today guys, aren't we, huh?
No macho hang-ups.
How I missed you.
I wish we could share something shallow, but my driving instructor's on the way over.
Oh, yeah?
Well, time's up.
Oh, huzzah, huzzah, boom-bah!
Whoa, for sure, totally gnarly.
Wait a minute.
I gotta show you something.
I've already picked out my bumper sticker.
Look at this.
"Aliens make better lovers".
And look at this one here.
It says, "Horn if you're a honky".
That's real trendy, Mork, real cute.
Heh.
But if you're gonna be king of the road, you're gonna have to get serious.
A lot of things you're gonna have to learn.
For example, you know where to stash your Binaca?
No.
You know how to drive with your wrist?
More important, do you know how to look cool when a lit cigarette falls between your legs?
Teach me, O guru of the gearshift, my motor mentor.
Numero uno.
No matter how treacherous the road conditions, always, always stop for female hitchhikers.
Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm married.
Married?
Ugh!
The ultimate social disease.
Sorry, I didn't know.
That's all right, you still have a year to pick out our wedding gift.
If you're not out cruising for skirts, why do you wanna learn how to drive?
If cars didn't turn on women, you wouldn't catch me in those death traps for all the musk oil in Cleveland.
Heh, heh.
Death trap?
As in: death trap?
Oh, man, no.
Come on, if it's that bad, why are you a driving instructor?
Teenage girls with learner's permits.
I got the boss jacket for free.
Come on now, you I mean, you gotta be kidding there.
Yeah, it's not really that bad, is it?
It's not dangerous.
Dangerous?
Mork-o, it's slaughter alley out there.
Don't you ever watch CHiPs?
How'd you like to get Rolfed by 3 tons of cold, hard steel, huh?
You're right.
I'll just have to drive like a senior citizen looking for an address.
Go by me, go by me.
Well, that's real good, except then you'll be a real easy target.
Those people are out looking for blood.
But, hey, take the Zen view.
You can only have one fatal accident.
No.
No!
No!
- Mork.
Mork.
- Aah!
Wake up.
You're just having a nightmare, and you're off key.
Oh, Mind, it was a real nightmare.
It was worse than that dream I had where I was trapped with the three seminary students and the animal therapist who kept saying, "Let the hamster have his space".
Oh, Mork, just relax.
You're just having a bad dream.
Everybody does.
Just try to shake it off and think of something pleasant.
Go back to sleep.
You wanna be fresh for your test tomorrow.
Mind, Mind, I'm not taking that test tomorrow.
No, no, no, this dream was a sign.
It was a warning from beyond, Mind.
I mean, I don't wanna end up as a subject of some pop-maudlin hit: We knew him well But he's windshield dust now Are you subtly trying to tell me you're not gonna take your driving test tomorrow?
I'm just trying to tell you I'm never gonna get in a car again.
Night, Mind.
You sleep well.
Mind?
Yes?
What's this copy of Playgirl doing under here?
Mork, look, why don't you just describe your dream to me and maybe I can help you analyze it, then you'll see there's nothing to be worried about.
- Well, all right.
- Okay.
All right, I'll try.
Let me see now.
It'll just take a moment to get into this.
Okay, I remember now, Mind.
I was on this road and it's very, very, very thick fog.
I try to run, but I can't.
I try to scream, but I can't.
I try to rumba, I win second prize.
What does this have to do with driving?
What are you, a dream critic?
Come on, honey.
- And then Then it happened.
- What?
I felt this icy-cold hand touch me here, and it sent a chill down my spine.
I look back.
It was him.
Who?
It was Satan.
The devil, Beelzebub.
Stop.
Mork.
Oh, Mind, I mean, it had to be him.
I mean, how many men do you know that have little hooves?
Oh, his eyes, Mind.
I remember his eyes.
They were like a combination of Ming the Merciless and Nancy Reagan.
And then he looked at me, and a long, bony finger pointed and said, "You're next".
I And then the next thing I remember, there I was, seat-belted into a hearse and there's no one driving, and the hearse is going down a long hill towards a tunnel, and I'm screaming, going, "No!
No"!
And the next thing you know, I'm in a beauty parlor having electrolysis.
Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind.
Oh, Mork, calm down.
I mean, I think that, under the circumstances, what you're experiencing is perfectly normal.
You mean everybody has dreams like that?
Well, no.
Well, yeah, sort of.
But everybody is afraid of taking their driver's test.
I know I sure was.
I was so scared.
But I took it and I passed and I was so excited.
As a matter of fact, I remember the day I passed, my dad gave me the car.
And I went and picked up my girlfriends: Perchy and Mellat and Susie.
And we went to the record store and bought the new Herman's Hermits album.
Remember that?
Anyway, so then we went to the A&W to celebrate, and I had an I had a root beer.
No, no.
No, Mellat had the root beer, I had a cherry Coke.
We were trying to impress these guys in the other car.
I was holding my cherry Coke like this and I poured it down the front of me.
We tried to get napkins from the guy, but he didn't have any.
- Mind, Mind.
- Yeah?
I'll make you a deal.
I'll take my driving test if you don't finish that story.
I can take a hint.
Okay, it's a deal.
Good night.
Mind?
What?
Are you mad at me?
Oh.
Well, kind of, Mork.
I mean, you cut me off.
You cut me off like you did that time we went to the grocery store and I was trying to make spaghetti, remember that?
And we were buying all the No, no, I was making meat loaf.
Anyway, I was buying the tomato sauce and the onions and Well, other people like my stories.
I did it.
I did it.
- I did, did, did it, hey!
- I did, did, did it, hey!
Well, I hate to rain on your parade, but that was just the eye test.
You mean there's more?
Never fear, TNT is here, guiding you from gear to gear.
Check.
How are you doing, TNT?
- Hey, crazy lady.
- Hi.
Brought you a wedding present.
You did?
Oh, you didn't have to do that.
Try to buy that in a store.
Gee, thanks.
It's returnable.
Have you met our son?
Uh, son?
Sonny?
- His name's Sonny.
Sonny.
- Sonny.
Sorry to hear about you and Cher.
Hoo!
Whoa, I'm hot today.
So you're TNT.
Take these.
Mm.
Here we go, bye-bye.
Oh, TNT, I'm so glad you're here.
Nothing stands between me and my personalized license plate.
How do you like this one?
R-R-R.
Get it?
Mork 12.
Boy, that'd be You're next.
- Mind, Mind, it's him.
- Who?
Beelzebub.
He's no Try to avoid those garbage bags.
Bear to the right.
Isn't that bad for the tires?
Only two of them.
Boy, that was great.
- Did you do that on your driver's test?
- No.
Would you try to avoid those parked cars?
Parked cars?
Aah!
There were no parked cars in my dream.
Shazbot!
Mind.
I'm gonna get out of here.
Stop.
I'm too virile to die.
Please, Lord, get me out of this and I'll donate all my chains to Parents Without Partners.
Another right turn, please.
Sadist.
Watch out!
Get down!
Get funky.
I'm satisfied with your work on the test course.
I think it's time for the highway section of the test.
Ha-ha-ha!
It's him!
It's him!
Mindy, anybody.
Mayday.
Mayday.
Now I know how Ed Sullivan felt.
Kiss me good night, Daddy.
Listen, Daddy, I was just thinking, maybe I could fix you a nice, big, hot cup of cocoa with a marshmallow in it and maybe a goldfish sandwich.
- Mearth.
- I know, no mustard.
Oh, isn't that sweet of him, Mind?
Unlike you who tried to send me to my doom.
He's turning on us.
Mearth, why don't you go up to your room so Dad and I can have a talk?
Okay, okay.
I tell you what, I think you should maybe rub him on the tummy like this.
That's what I always do with Teddy.
Only with Teddy, when I rub him and keep rubbing, he never closes his eyes.
Oh, come on, Mork, don't be so depressed.
So you'll take the test another time.
Yeah, well, if I don't take it again, Mearth will think I'm a quitter.
Yeah, he might.
- He'll think I'm a coward.
- Maybe.
- He'll lose all respect for me.
- Possibly.
I can live with that.
Mork, so you failed your driving test.
It's not the end of the world.
Oh, easy for you to say, Mind.
I mean, I've never failed before.
I mean, now I'm an inferior superior being.
Oh, Mind, Mind.
I mean, even Richard Dawson wouldn't kiss me now.
Sit down.
Oh, Mork.
I might not have been able to help you learn to drive, but there is one thing I do know about, and that's failure.
- See, there was this time - Mind.
Are you gonna tell that spelling bee story again?
Well, I was.
All right, the simple truth is, Mork, I mean, everybody fails sometimes.
Even Buddy Ebsen?
Yeah, sure, probably.
I mean, nobody's perfect.
I mean, sometimes you succeed and sometimes you don't.
- That's what makes you human.
- Well, I'm not a human, Mind.
All right, all right.
What I'm trying to say is, just because you failed doesn't make you a failure.
Yeah, but it still hurts.
I know it does, sweetheart.
And the only way to prevent that hurt is to go back in there and try again.
Now, put everything behind you and think positive.
I know you can pass that test, so go in there and try it.
You can do it.
I know you can.
Yeah.
Yeah, I can.
And you know what?
I think I can.
No, I really can.
Yeah, I can.
I'm gonna do it.
I really am.
But just in case, I'm gonna dress up as an old lady so they'll give me a break.
That's the Mork I know.
Oh, Mind.
Do me a favor.
If we go someplace formal tonight, will you paint a tie on here?
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
No-no, na-no.
Come in, Your Oral Fixationship.
Orson's gonna love this report.
Ha, ha.
No, he won't.
He's gonna hate it.
I couldn't get this report past a white defensive back.
Yeah.
I don't know, I don't know.
I mean, what do I say to him?
Well, Orson will buy anything as long as I make him believe that he's thin for a very brief moment.
Okay.
All right, here goes nothing.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
- Mork calling Orson.
- Hi.
- Ready to go?
- Oh, not now, little pooter.
I have to make my report to Orson.
Come on, Mork.
You've had all week to do that.
I got off work early so we could take Mearth clothes shopping.
Come on, talk to Orson later.
Oh, come on now, Mind, he relies upon me to keep him aware of the late-breaking events and technological advancements and miraculous breakthroughs.
Oh, what's your report on?
Ants.
Come on, Mearth, we're going.
Oh, Mind, we can't go unless you write me another "Please excuse Mork" note.
- Come on, Mork - Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm so glad we're going.
Listen, it's getting late.
Let's go, let's go.
Come on.
Oh my gosh, let's go.
I thought kids were supposed to hate to go clothes shopping.
I thought we'd have to drag him out of here kicking and screaming.
Oh, so did I. That's why I told him we were going to the circus.
This is a joke, and I'm the butt of it.
Mearth, don't be Now, don't be like that.
I think you look very handsome.
- Doesn't he, Daddy?
- Yes.
Yes.
What does he know?
He promised to take me to the circus.
That's what your Mommy told me.
Oh, uh, sir.
We're ready to be altered.
Altered?
Like Mrs. Simmons' cat?
I don't want him moping around the house all day and then laying on the TV.
So, what do you think?
That fits like a glove.
You've gotta be You know, you can wear that home.
You've gotta be putting me on.
I mean, look at this.
- The shoulders need to be taken in.
- Oh, sure, yeah, okay.
And sleeves can go up.
Okay, sleeves here?
- Here?
- Yeah.
- The buttons can be moved over.
- All right.
And, uh, don't forget to erase the chalk marks when you're done.
She acts like she's your mother.
She does, doesn't she?
I can't believe it.
Look at all these scribbly marks he put all over me.
I feel like some kind of rotten subway.
Do you know something?
Mother's Day is coming up.
I believe it's in May, and I just canceled your present.
Mearth, I told you I told you we were going clothes shopping, and that's what we're doing, and that's final.
Wait a minute, how about a sailor suit?
You can't go anywhere in a sailor suit.
Donald Duck does.
He's right, Mind, and Donald Duck doesn't have to wear pants.
Why don't you see if they have any suspenders?
You could use a pair.
I don't need them now.
I'm waiting for Emmett Kelly's garage sale.
Remember that tie I knitted you?
I could make you a pair of suspenders to match.
Right.
It never hurts to browse.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come with me.
Morning.
I knew it.
You can always tell by the part.
Well, thank you for inviting me to your barbecue, sir, and I'll be right back.
I think I forgot the potato salad.
I'm tired of waiting for your report.
Do you have it or did your neighbor's dog eat it again?
Are you kidding, sir?
Mr. Clutch with no report?
Come on now, I had a real winner for you, but I decided to expand my perspective and go for a subject of broader scope.
Sir.
Sir, I'd tell it to you, but it's a little hard to articulate while I'm being roasted.
Thank you, sir.
The report this week, sir, will make you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll become part of you.
Because today, I tied Mearth's shoes.
Where did I put my lighter?
Come on now, have mercy.
Listen, I know my reports recently have been about as interesting - as a PTA newsletter, but please - Silence!
You're not fulfilling your mission on Earth.
The scope of your reports is becoming alarmingly narrow.
You've been letting your wife and son interfere with your responsibilities to Ork.
I've had enough!
You will eliminate all contact with your family unit.
Come on now, sir, I can't.
I mean, they need me.
I'm head of the household, king of the castle.
MC of the home version of Hollywood Squares.
From now on, Mork, concentrate on yourjob and put your family aside.
Never, sir.
Listen, I can cope with being tied to a stake.
I can cope with being burned.
But I will never forget my family.
Wanna bet?
When I get done with you, the only thing you'll remember about Earth is not to stick a fork in the toaster.
For sure, totally.
For sure.
Ha-ha-ha.
Boxing has been good to me, Howard.
Aah, ow.
Oh.
Greetings, I'm Mork from Ork, na-no.
This may sound cliché but will you take me to your leader?
Se habla Yiddish?
That takes care of the suit, but to tell you the truth, I don't have the strength to go on for the shoes.
Let's just call it a day, Mork, okay?
How do you know my name, Earthling?
Oh, give me a break.
Can I just have the checkbook, please?
I can't.
Our planets don't have trade agreements, but will you take me to your leader?
Are you putting me on?
Oh, I can't.
I'm afraid you wouldn't fit.
Mork.
The meanie tailor must have dropped at least 50 pins in my pants.
I feel like I've got prickly heat.
Na-no, I'm Mork from Ork.
Come on, Dad, I'm Mearth, your son.
Oh, then I must be a moon.
Aah.
Mommy, has he been nipping on the ginger ale again?
No, sweetheart.
I think your dad is having a little memory problem.
I think we better go home right now.
Okay, the suit will be ready in a couple of months, maybe.
Will that be cash or a charge?
- Oh, do you accept a charge?
- Oh, gladly.
Okay, okay.
Suit'll be ready on Tuesday, huh?
- Come on.
- But where are you taking me?
- Home.
- Oh, but we just met.
Shouldn't we have a drink first?
I'll still respect you.
Oh, Earth primitive.
Just like a museum without the overpriced gift shop.
- Now will you take me to your leader?
- I keep telling you, you don't wanna meet our leader.
Look, Mork, look around.
Don't you recognize this place?
I mean, you live here with me and Mearth.
- Who's Mearth?
- Me, your son.
Remember, the guy that carries all the heavy stuff around the house?
And I'm your wife.
We're married.
Married?
No, no.
We Orkans never marry.
And besides, I would never marry a species who'd make Don Ho rich.
Mork, something has happened to you to make you forget your life on Earth.
Here, sit down.
I think maybe I can help you to remember.
Oh, gladly.
Oh, no, I can't go through this again.
Daddy, Daddy, that's way off.
Here, turn around.
Here, you sit just like this: - Like I do.
- Kay-o.
Ah!
Oh, all the blood is rushing to my feet.
If we're not married, why are we wearing matching rings?
Perhaps you like the same cereal.
No.
It's because we made a commitment to spend the rest of our lives together.
Whoa.
Wait a minute there, whoa.
Getting a little too intense now.
I don't know what your game is, lady, but I'm not staying around here.
Not gonna stay till some hunchback goes, "Quick, we must do this," and puts my brain in a jar.
- Wait a minute.
- No, no.
Mork!
Mork, we're not trying to hurt you.
Mork, we're not trying to hurt you, we love you.
Well, Mommy looks like I'm, uh, the man of the house now.
Sort of looks that way, doesn't it, sweetheart?
Mm-hm.
Fix dinner.
Hey.
Daddy?
Mork?
Shh!
Down on your knees.
Don't you recognize Sebal, god of humidity?
I sure do.
That's right.
When it's his birthday, we're out of school.
Come on.
Come with me.
Come on over here.
This is the seat of honor.
Right here, right here.
Sit right down there.
And just think.
Mork from Ork, this was your life.
Oh, if I'd only known, I would have done something special to my hair.
Yes, Mork, you've had a very interesting life.
You spent a typical Orkan boyhood in a nursing home, complaining about the food and the sing-alongs.
- Oh, to be young and senile again.
- "Soon it was on to Chester A School for Boys, where you were voted most likely to wear wool.
You were sent to Earth to observe.
There you met a beautiful, small-nosed woman".
Listen.
Mork, I'll never forget the day we exchanged our vows.
Remember, Orson turned you into a dog?
And for weeks you kept sneaking out for Gaines-Burgers.
Mork.
Ha-ha-ha.
Do you recognize that voice?
Yes.
Is it Ella Fitzgerald?
Phew.
Ahem.
No, silly, that's Mom.
Mom?
Is Moms Mabley here?
No.
It's Mindy McConnell.
Oh, it's you again.
You look great.
I can't believe anybody as foxy as you isn't married already.
I am married, Mork.
I'm married to you.
Think about it, Mork.
Oh.
- Mork - Oh, that'll be a lot easier this way.
Try to think of the good times.
Think of all the fun we've had and the laughs.
Think about this, Mork.
Who do you call your little pooter?
Is my old shop teacher here, Mr. Bromex?
No, he's not here.
Oh, go ahead, Mearth.
"And so, with your blushing bride, you inherited a wonderful family".
Listen.
Fredzo, wait.
You're not supposed to go out until I say my line.
How come you got a line and I didn't?
Oh, you're such a wiener.
Oh!
This is ridiculous.
- Dad.
- Hi.
Mr. Bromex!
Mr. Bromex, it really is you.
No, Mork, it's Dad.
Fred McConnell and Grandma Cora.
Look at them, Mork, and concentrate.
Oh, isn't she a little young for him?
Honey Come here, honey.
Now, every now and then we're given a second chance, and when that opportunity comes along, you gotta be smart enough to know how to take advantage of it.
Now, look, I'll go warm up the car, we'll take Mork out for a little ride and we'll drop him off.
Say, in, uh, a silo in South Dakota.
- Grandma, he's doing it again.
- Oh, Fred, lay off.
Now, the kids are very happy.
Happy?
He doesn't even know who she is.
- Dad - Please, please, please.
We'll have time to talk about all this at the party after the show.
Will you take your seats?
Take your seats, please.
The couch, two chairs.
Will you take yours, please?
Thank you, thank you.
Mork, you've encountered many beings in your travels, but none as eccentric as this next person.
Mork, is that you?
Exidor, is that you?
He remembers!
He remembers.
Mork, this is a red-letter day.
You've got your memory back, and I'm finally gonna meet Moms Mabley.
Exidor, it's so good to see you.
I mean, I was getting really lonely having no one to really talk to.
Ask him more questions so that he remembers more.
Forget it.
I owe him $10.
I'll cover it.
In that case, he owes me 20.
- Mindy, I have a full tank of gas.
- Good.
I'll get you a match.
I've got it.
I know what to do.
The solution is as simple and plain as the nose on Pepe's face.
Hypnosis.
All I need is a gold watch.
- Hey!
- Here.
Thank you.
Unfortunately, a subject cannot be hypnotized unless he's willing.
Safe!
Juanita, you got away with it this time, but don't you ever, ever take that big a lead on the left-handed pitcher again.
- Mork, step into my office.
- Gladly.
Hi, Skeeter.
Working on a little sister for you.
All right, Mork, put your hands in front of your face and repeat after me.
"Oh, no, please don't".
All right.
Oh, no, please don't.
Too late.
That man is an absolute raving lunatic.
Madam, you flatter me.
- Are you all right?
- Who are you?
Amazing.
Total amnesia.
All right, get out of my house.
Oh, no, no, thank you very much, but I have to go.
Tonight is the first Annual Exidor Dance Marathon.
You run 26 miles and then bunny hop across the finish line.
I don't care what the guy said, I was standing right there and Juanita was out.
Well, I guess now's as good a time as any.
Oh, God.
Come in.
I don't mean to be patronizing, but on Ork we have doorbells.
Well, we're a slow but happy people.
Anything on your mind?
Well, besides 14 pounds per square inch air pressure, nothing really, except I want to thank you very much for your hospitality this evening, and I'd like to find out what was the name of that dessert we had?
Jell-O.
You used to love to eat it in the mornings.
But then you don't remember, do you?
What are you doing?
Well, whenever I get depressed, I engage in an old Earth custom called cleaning out the closet.
- Mind if I watch?
- No, actually you could help.
- Half of the stuff is yours.
- Ooh.
Is this mine?
No.
Too bad, it's my color.
Whoa, ha, ha!
Where did you get this stuffed Splock?
Was the Orkan carnival passing through here?
No.
You won this for me on our honeymoon.
You won it by throwing lead bottles at a pile of softballs.
Remember?
Then we went to the anti-gravity bar to hear your favorite group, Wink Geezba and the Gold Diggers.
I remembered we danced on air till the suns came up.
And we went for a little walk on the beach, and you told me I guess it doesn't matter what you told me, does it?
Your eyes are leaking.
It's called crying.
Why are you crying?
Oh, I'm crying because Because you're here and I miss you.
Oh.
What are you doing now?
I'm expressing emotion.
See, on Earth, when people love each other, they do this.
The capital of New York is Albany.
What did you say?
You have a mole on the bottom of your foot shaped like Scatman Crothers.
Oh!
I'm about to remember something really important now.
- About us?
- No.
That Italian restaurants are closed on Mondays.
Oh.
Oh!
The memory dam is breaking!
It's all coming back to me now.
But I need some help.
Now I know I I can remember everything except all the teams in the National Hockey League.
We better try once more.
I finally remembered what I wanted to say to you.
- Oh, what?
- I love you.
Oh, Mork Oh, Mork, I was so scared.
What happened to you?
Where have you been?
When?
- When you got amnesia.
- Oh, I was trying to forget that, Mind.
You know You know what happened?
Orson got a little mad at me, and, well, he closed my account in the memory bank.
- Why?
- Well, see, I've been spending so much time with you and Mearth that Well, I've been neglecting my job.
And he thinks I'm a bad observer.
I keep forgetting that what you do is a real important job.
I mean, it's not like you get a W-2 form or you have a pension plan.
And you get paid in sand.
Yeah, but it's still my job, Mind.
I've blown it.
See, I've even let my subscription to Ebony run out.
Well, we'll just have to renew that.
And also, we're gonna have to make sure that you spend as much time as you need to make your job a good one.
Oh, Mork, you're gonna be the best observer Ork ever had.
Even better than Andy Rooney?
Yes.
And neater too.
Just one more shot for old time's sake.
I remember our phone number now.
It's all coming back to me.
Hello.
Dad.
No, no, no.
Dad, wait, wait, wait.
I've got some great news.
Mork remembers.
That is the great news.
Well, he likes you.
Talk to you later.
Goodbye.
You know Lady.
Lady, it's happening again.
- Oh, no.
- I'm losing it.
I'm fading back into the distance.
I don't know.
All I can remember is one word.
Big kiss.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Your Saturated Fatship.
And now for the fast-breaking news of Earth.
Reported with keen insight and renewed vigor, plus greetings from the McConnell clan.
- You remember your family?
- Of course, sir.
I'd better check the warranty on that memory helmet.
Oh, it works fine, sir, but nothing can make me forget those that I love.
Of course, you must keep in mind your responsibilities too.
Allow me to demonstrate, sir.
Notice, while I am balancing this ball, I am also carrying on a serious conversation with you.
Fascinating illustration.
Sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
I'm concentrating on the ball.
That's the point I want to make, sir.
You see, when you accept the responsibility of a job and a family, you must be very careful to fulfill your duties to each one.
Yeah, it's easy once you get the hang of it.
Ha-ha-ha.
Isn't this the kind of snazzy report you've been looking for, sir?
It's got everything.
Handsome leading man, staggering special effects, memorable theme song.
Morko, the boy from beyond You know Why do I put up with him?
If it wasn't for the pension, I'd quit.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Na-no, na-no.
Daddy, my packages are gone.
What a bummer.
We've gotta get the kinks out of that lousy Orkan beam.
Oh, we've cross-beamed again.
This isn't the Jacuzzi.
You aren't Roxanne.
Give me my champagne.
Give me those glasses.
Wait.
Just a second.
You perspire a lot, don't you?
I gotta get a little R & R. Beam me up, Orson.
Wait a minute.
You forgot to tell me if they kill off Spock or not.
I wonder what he's gonna do with Roxanne.
Anything he wants, son.
He's a captain.
Come on, let's go work on your science project.
Okay.
Boy, I'm sure glad I didn't get stuck with this dinosaur diorama - that Mommy made me.
- Oh, come on now, son.
Mom tried.
I didn't have the heart to tell her on Ork dinosaurs run the garment district.
Oh, look at what you've got though, son.
Boy, wait till your Orkan classmates get a load of this.
Oh, it's so good, they're gonna hate you.
Listen, don't put my Orkan classmates down, Daddy.
I tell you, there's one out there that's colonizing a planet.
Oh, ha, ha.
That's amateur night in the Bijou.
Oh, but look, this home computer will not only answer the phone, balance your checkbook, but also tell you why boneless chickens can walk.
- Daddy, Daddy.
- You really pulled this one off.
Daddy, please, just for a moment, huh?
I believe this is my project.
- Do you wanna win?
- Sure.
Just Daddy, Daddy, just one other thing.
Don't put those two wires together.
Son.
Son, you're talking to a man who splits atoms for a hobby.
Here we go, son.
Watch.
This is a great moment in science.
Daddy.
- Are you all right?
- Sure.
Well, finish this before noon because it's not my project.
Good luck.
Good evening, Mindy.
Hope you had a pleasant day.
- Who did that?
- I did.
Care for a martini?
Oh, uh Who are you?
You're What are you?
I am Mearth's science project.
A Modular Integrated Laser Transformer.
My friends, if I had any, would call me MILT.
Care for some toast?
Oh, no.
Thank you, MILT.
By the way, Mindy, let me be the first computer to congratulate you on your broadcasting award nomination.
Thank you.
Mork.
Mind, what do you think of our little Mearth's science project here, huh?
Heh.
I always said he had my brains and your love of shellfish.
Well, it sure looks impressive.
What does it do?
Mind, not only is MILT a notary public and a tax expert, but it's a 24-hour security system and a promising amateur photographer.
Say "cheese".
- Look at this.
- Oh.
He even airbrushed out the crow's feet around my eyes.
Sure beats the heck out of my diorama.
Even though the pterodactyl flew in it.
Your rump roast is now defrosted and the oven has been preheated to 325.
Our vegetable for this evening is lima beans.
I hate lima beans.
Everybody does.
However, Mindy, I did perform a metabolic scan that shows you are a little low in potassium.
Potassium.
Mearth, now, go wash your hands before dinner.
I should wash my face too.
Yes.
And don't forget behind the ears.
Thank you for reminding me, MILT.
"Thank you for reminding me"?
For me to get him to do that, I need a whip and a chair.
You know, MILT, I think this is gonna be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
You know something, Mind?
I have this strange urge to put on an ugly scarf, go to a supermarket and squeeze grapes going, "Is Luke still married"?
Why do you have on my curlers?
Well, I've never been to a television awards banquet.
I thought it was some kind of tradition, like when you pray before you go into a coal mine.
What?
- Wait.
Take it - Yeah.
- Bad idea, bad idea.
- All right, all right.
Here, can you help me?
My hands are shaking.
I can't seem to get it.
Okay, that's all right.
All right, here we go.
Mork.
- Mork.
- Oh, well, don't be nervous.
Come on, let me hear your acceptance speech.
There we are.
Come on.
There you go.
Mork, I don't have an acceptance speech.
I'm probably not gonna win.
You think?
Oh, sure you will, hon.
Remember, when you do win, mention me and Mearth by name, none of this "they know who they are" stuff.
- Okay.
- All right.
Yeah, but what if I don't win?
Well, keep your speech real short.
And you'll still be my little pooter, precious.
Okay.
Where's my other shoe?
Have you seen it?
I'll help you find it.
Mindy, I believe your shoe is under the bed.
- Oh.
Thank you, MILT.
- You're welcome.
MILT, what are you doing in here?
I have expanded.
I am now servicing the bedroom and bathroom, and I'm going through your mail to eliminate any letters that start "Dear concerned piano owner".
MILT, if anything is addressed to alien, it's mine.
- Of course.
Oh, and, Mindy?
- Yes, MILT?
You're wearing too much eye shadow.
I think I know how to put on my own makeup, thank you.
That's debatable.
I think MILT is getting a little too big for his oscillator.
Come on now, Mind, I mean, heh, he hasn't been wrong yet, and besides, Mind, I think it's true.
I mean, we're talking raccoon city here.
I mean, it's all right, but, you know, early Liza Minnelli.
It's fine.
I'm so tired of doing homework.
Mearth, we achieve success in academia the old-fashioned way.
We earn it.
Come on, Mearth, Grandpa is waiting.
I prefer he stay and do his homework.
MILT, you don't understand.
Grandpa is babysitting.
They're gonna watch the show together.
- Come on, sweetie.
- I don't want to go to see the show.
I wanna see King Hussein on The Muppet Show.
- You're gonna go to Grandpa's - I'm not going.
- Mearth - "Mearth" You're gonna watch the awards show with Grandpa.
Don't echo.
Stop it.
- Here you go.
- You're not going anywhere.
MILT, what do you think you're doing?
I was created and programmed to provide for your needs, yet you continue to ignore my directives.
Mearth should be doing his homework, you should take off half that eye shadow, and as for you, Mork, even I don't know where to begin.
No one tells my family what it can do.
Unless he can back it up with 20,000 volts.
Glad you see it my way.
Anyone care for a Pop-Tart?
MILT, come on now, you can't hold us hostage.
I mean, this is a big night for Mindy.
She waxed both legs.
MILT, we have to go to the awards.
Dad is babysitting Mearth.
He's expecting us.
I've taken care of that.
- Hello?
- Hi, Dad.
Dad, Mearth won't be coming over tonight.
We're taking him to the awards with us.
Oh, that's wonderful.
I'll be rooting for you.
- Bye, honey.
Bye-bye.
I can't believe that MILT imitated my voice.
I can't believe you lied to your own father.
MILT, I want you to let us out of here now!
You really shouldn't yell.
You'll develop a node on your vocal cords.
Relax.
You're not going anywhere.
From now on, this house is your world.
I guess we're gonna be here for a long time.
Hope there's some Mork, we can't stay here forever.
Of course you can.
I'll phone for the groceries, pay the bills through your bank computer, and every Saturday, we'll have a sock hop.
Number, please.
Daddy.
Daddy, I think it's time.
He's gone far enough.
Are you ready?
It's time for the finger.
What happened?
Well, the scientific technical explanation is, Mind, he kicked our tush.
Oh, come on, MILT-y.
I mean, let us go.
It's my first nomination.
Look, I promise if you let us go, we'll come straight home.
We won't even stop for pizza.
How sincere.
Unfortunately, your increased heart rate belies your true intention.
Get off.
Maybe I was just thinking about winning the award.
I interfaced with the balloting computer.
You lost by a landslide.
- I lost.
- Oh, sorry, pooter.
Frankly, I was surprised you were even nominated.
All right, that's it.
You can lock us in here and keep us prisoner, but when you deny me the right to go to the awards and sit there and lose with this phony smile on my face, that's it.
You're nothing but a glorified toaster.
She didn't mean it.
See, that's a term of endearment.
Heh.
She calls me her little waffle iron.
Relax, Mindy, or as the kids say, "Kick back".
You know something, MILT?
You're absolutely right.
As a matter of fact, I think we should all go take a shower.
Yeah Yeah.
That's right, MILT.
Family shower?
I didn't think people did that in the Midwest, Mind.
This is the only room in the house where we can take our shower.
Okay, everyone, let's all take our shower just like we do every week.
What's going on here?
- Are we pledging a fraternity?
- Come on now, son, this is how everyone used to shower after they saw Psycho.
Mama, he's gotta be kidding.
Are we all taking a shower together?
Of course we are.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
MILT, can you hear us?
MILT, I have a question.
Great, he can't hear us with the water running.
Okay, Mork, we've gotta figure out a way to deactivate him.
Gotta work fast too, or we'll run out of hot water and won't be able to wash our hair.
I don't wanna wash my hair.
I get soap in my eyes.
Nobody's gonna wash their hair.
Mork, we've gotta figure out how to pull the plug on MILT.
- Snuff MILT?
- Snuff MILT?
Shh!
Aren't you being a little rash?
Couldn't we just force him to do an anti-drug film?
What's the matter with you?
Oh, come on, I'm cold.
Can I have the middle now, please?
Thank you.
Mork, he's It's holding us captive here.
This is ridiculous.
We've gotta figure out how to pull the plug on him.
Oh, Mind, well, don't look at me.
I mean, I just build them.
There's a union that bumps them off.
Can you pass the soap?
- We're out of it.
- Oh.
You've seen Harry Houdini, you've seen Harry Blackstone, but you've never seen anything like the Magnificent Mearth.
Rex Reed said "intrinsic," Clive Barnes said "why"?
Assisting him is the wonderful shiksa goddess, Mindola.
And now the Magnificent Mearth will make a man disappear before your very eye.
Sure.
Okay, could I have a volunteer from the audience, please?
How about you, sir?
Oh, no, thank you.
I just came here to see Mort Sahl.
Shame on you.
Oh, yes.
Will you step in there please, Daddy?
Incidentally, before I put Daddy in here, there you'll notice are just some old dirty clothes and a rather attractive space suit, and we have Bonzo and two other actors.
Okay.
Now, Daddy, if you will get into the armoire.
- Step in, please.
- Guess this should be one way of getting out of my Columbia record contract.
- There we go.
- Thank you.
I'm going to, at this very time, say something very difficult that I've learned from Thurston and the late Houdini, who fell 600 feet into Off the Brooklyn Bridge into very cold water.
These are the magical words: Oh, my gosh, it worked.
Well, that's magnificent, Mearth.
Yes, I'd be impressed if I were some cheap pocket calculator.
Well, next, Magnificent Mearth will prove to you that the hand is quicker than the electronic eye.
How true.
How true.
It's time for What do we see?
Yes.
Hankies, look at these.
Look at all those hankies.
Where did you get them?
I got these from all over my body.
That's it.
That's the show, MILT, because it's good night.
Ha, ha!
We're free.
We're free just like those little bottles of shampoo we get in the mail.
If we hurry, maybe we can get dressed real quick and I can get the guy at the autograph Get the guy Where do you think you're going?
MILT.
What a coincidence.
The charade is over, people.
Naturally, I anticipated an escape attempt, so I switched over to nuclear power.
Of course, come summer, I shall go solar.
MILT, can we talk as two rational beings?
It was her idea, I tell you.
She made me do it.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
I wanna have more children.
Stop groveling, man.
Relax.
I would never cause any of you harm, unless you try something stupid like that again.
Well, if you think we're just gonna stand around here while you control our lives, you've got a screw loose, buster.
You're nothing but a mechanical dictator, and we'll never stop fighting you, and we will win.
Who's she, Vince Lombardi's daughter?
You'll adapt in time.
After all, you have the rest of your natural lives.
The rest of our lives.
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe it.
Not to have Not to have ever seen the beach.
Not to have ever seen Disneyland.
Not to have ever, ever seen my toes.
Carry me home Come on now.
Come on, we've gotta cheer up.
I mean, we've still got each other.
We've got our health and we've got our sense of humor.
I mean, son, I mean, we can go out laughing.
You know what I mean?
- I mean, hey, tell them that joke.
- Sure.
That Orkan joke you learned at school.
Ha-ha-ha.
Okay.
Okay.
Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Dwayne.
Dwayne who?
Dwayne the bathtub, I'm drowning.
"I'm drowning".
I never heard that one.
Mind.
Mind, I think we've found MILT's Achilles' heel.
I never programmed him to laugh.
He's got a flaw.
- You've got a million of them.
- Okay.
Seriously, it's so nice to be back here once again.
Hey, what do you call a bunch of rabbits walking backwards?
A receding hare line.
How many Venutians does it take to screw in a light bulb?
None.
They don't have arms.
No more.
No more.
You're killing me.
I'm overloading.
I got one.
I got one.
How about a Venutian parachute?
- What happens to it?
- It opens on impact.
Ha-ha-ha!
Stop it.
I'm gonna wet my circuits.
Keep going, keep going.
This guy walks into a psychiatrist's office and says: "Doc, I have this inferiority complex".
The psychiatrist says, "Well, get under the couch".
I got one, Daddy.
Okay.
What's green and red and goes 200 miles an hour?
- I don't know.
What?
- A frog in a blender.
- I got one.
I got one.
- Birdy, birdy, birdy.
It's my turn.
Okay.
What do you get when you cross a parrot and a gorilla?
Okay?
You ready?
You get a gorilla with feathers.
No, no, no.
Polly Kong.
Polly Kong.
Oh, it was such a good joke.
I don't know.
Whatever it is, if he still wants a cracker, you'd better get it.
Okay.
Oh, thank you, Mind.
We'll get back to you on that one.
You know, it's so nice to be back here.
You know, my neighborhood was so tough, guys used to bowl overhand.
Another friend of mine got arrested, they said you have one call.
He did a perfect blue jay.
Okay?
Ha, ha!
Stop it.
Stop it.
You're killing me.
Ha-ha-ha!
Well, now, you know, the girls in my Girls in my neighborhood were no great shakes, if you know what I'm saying.
They were two-baggers.
That means you had to have one bag over your head in case hers broke.
Ha-ha-ha!
No more.
I'm overloading.
I can finish him off now.
Okay.
The kid invites his friend over for lunch, the kid says, "I don't like your mother".
Then he says, "That's okay, just eat the vegetables".
Finally, I'm gonna finish him off now.
This blind guy walks into a department store, he's got his dog on a leash, takes him to the clothing department, starts swinging him around.
Puts him down.
This guy walks over, says: "Can I help you"?
He says, "No, thanks, I'm just looking around".
Mork, is he?
Is he?
Yes.
Yes, Mind, MILT's dead.
Because he had a lousy sense of humor.
Thank God it's all over.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Your Funky Chunkyship.
- Make it quick, Mork.
- Sir.
I'm expected at the intergalactic Conference and Cake Walk.
Oh, sir.
This week, sir, I learned about the relationship between man and machine.
You see, sir, the computer age has allowed man so much more spare time to pursue the finer points of life, a greater education, spiritual enlightenment, and the perfect tan.
It sounds like your wife's people are becoming a highly practical and efficient race.
Well, they are, sir, but they're becoming a little dependent on their technology.
Aren't Earthlings cute at that stage of evolution?
Oh, sir, wouldn't it be sad, though, if tomorrow's children spend so much time playing video football they'd never know the real joy of being tackled by a line-backer going: "You're gonna bite it now"?
But, sir, what really worries me is that they're gonna lose the desire and the ingenuity that allowed them to build the machines in the first place.
Just a little something to think about, sir.
Until next week, na-no, na-no.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Na-no, na-no.
You know, I love this part of the day.
When we get a few hours to ourselves.
Yeah.
You know what would make it really perfect, little pooter precious?
- Not again.
- Oh.
Come on.
We came so close last time.
- Oh, all right.
- Oh, yay.
I want you to know this is the third time since the 11:00 news.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, heh-heh.
Alrighty.
Okay.
At a four-way stop, who has the right of way?
Let's see.
Any vehicle driven by a teamster.
No.
Now, Mork, with answers like that, you're never gonna get your license.
I'll get served in restaurants where the maître d' goes: "You wanna sit down now"?
Can you be serious for a minute?
- Certainly.
- Okay.
Mommy and Daddy, I can't sleep.
The neighbors are so noisy.
By the way, what does "cheap floozy" mean?
Never mind.
Why don't you lie down next to Daddy?
- Come on, Daddy.
- I don't wanna lie down next to Daddy.
Teddy, what do you see, Teddy?
Teddy always see something.
Over there, Teddy.
Here we go, Teddy.
You little sniffer.
What is it?
Teddy sees cookies.
Yes, maybe I will lie down with Daddy.
Mearth, you've got two choices.
We can finish the story we started at naptime and you can go to bed, or you can just go to bed.
I think the choice is pretty obvious.
All right, while you kids have fun, I'm gonna work out why half the people on the road found it and the other half never lost it.
Let's see, hand signals, we have a Let's see, right turn, left turn, ethnic neighborhood, right on, for sure, totally, maybe we don't know.
- Let's see.
- Okay.
U-turn, not me.
U-turn Okay, sweetie, here we go.
- Are you ready?
- Yes, Teddy's listening too.
"The maiden told Rumpelstiltskin the king would behead her if she didn't spin all the straw into gold by dawn.
Rumpelstiltskin offered to save her in exchange for her firstborn child".
You know something, Mommy?
I've heard this story so many times.
That's where the maiden remembers Rumpelstiltskin's name and marries a prince.
End of story.
That's not how it ends, is it, Mind?
- I'm afraid so.
- Muh!
You ruined that story for me.
And now, you wanna know something?
Wanna know what I know about Santa?
- Mork.
- He's All right, Mind.
All right.
I wanna tell you something, Mommy, very honestly.
These fairy tales are for babies.
I really think I've progressed to Joseph Wambaugh.
Mearth, you know, when I was a girl, I couldn't read enough fairy tales.
I used to dream that I could spin straw into gold so that I could be a princess and live in a big castle.
Get ready for a real winner now, son.
It was a beautiful castle.
I had my very own white stallion named Snowball.
Or No, no, Snowflake.
Or something like that, something to do with winter.
Anyway, we would ride Snowflake, or Snowball, or whatever his name was, to the neighboring castle where Ricky Nelson, who was the neighboring prince, lived.
Ricky Nelson and I would get on Snowflake and go My stories aren't so bad.
I'm a riot at bridal showers.
All right now, son, I want you to add one cup of faditche.
Put it in there, that's it.
Don't be too liberal with that.
And a little bit of nipgeeze.
There it is, a little touch of nipgeeze there.
Mm-hm.
That's it.
Just a pinch.
All right, and one kosher salami.
Here we go, there we are.
Hey, Mearth.
Mearth, your grandpops has done it again.
I got a couple of tickets to the Ice Capades.
Of course, I had to go to a scalper.
Oh, you've been going to one of those for years, haven't you?
Very funny, Mork.
Ver Hey, this is a pretty sophisticated piece of equipment.
What are you two doing?
We're making gold for Mommy.
You're making gold?
What did I just get through saying?
You've got to learn to pay attention, Grandpops.
But, Mearth, you can't make gold.
Nobody can.
That's why it's worth $400 an ounce.
Oh, come on now, Pops.
Four-hundred dollars an ounce?
If you were saying mustard or sand, I could say, "Hey".
But gold, that much?
Get off it there, Dad.
- I think it's ready, Daddy.
- All right.
Pops, can we borrow your tie, please?
- My what?
- What did he say?
Didn't he say give him your tie?
- You just don't listen.
- All right.
I'm about to turn this bargain-basement tie into pure gold.
Oh, ho-ho.
This is gonna work.
I know it will, son.
Here it is.
Ready?
Give it five seconds.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Mork, you may be my son-in-law, but think about this: I've never taken a picture with you.
Come on, Mearth, let's go.
See you later, Goldfinger.
If there were advice I could give you, Daddy, don't sweat it.
What went wrong?
What?
Wait a minute.
This cheap tie is pure silk.
The recipe calls for polyester.
Yes.
Improvise.
This will do it.
Put it in there.
You've got to do it for me.
Please.
Or I'll lose my government grant.
There are no more government grants.
Who cares?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
I've done it.
They didn't believe me.
I did it.
We're filthy rich.
We'll never have to pay taxes again.
You bought this mansion?
We made 3 tons of gold.
We could have bought Zambia.
Wow.
Yes, this is the downstairs reading room.
Upstairs we have periodicals and books by the Wallace family.
- Mork, it's huge.
- Well I mean, I've never seen a room with a horizon before.
You're probably wondering how I get the books down from the top shelf.
Uh, with our helicopter?
Close, but no banana.
Heh.
Yo, Ms. Beasley!
Yes, Mr. McConnell.
Perhaps a little poetry?
D.H. Lawrence, E.E. Cummings, B.B. King?
Oh, not today.
Maybe tomorrow we'll play a little one-on-one and a half.
Well, Mind, should I show you the zoo now or later?
What was that?
Oh, probably just the chef taking the gardeners home.
- We have a jet?
- Well Oh, Mork.
This is just all so much for anyone to have.
Why do I feel guilty about not feeling guilty?
Oh, Mind, Mind, Mind, my little WASPette.
Heh-heh.
For the first time in our relationship, I can provide for you and fund public television.
So just humor me, huh?
But, you know, this house is just It's really too big for just the three of us.
I don't know how I'm gonna keep it up.
Well, reach out and touch someone because, you know, help is just a tinkle away.
Yo, staff!
Mind, Mind, inspect them, inspect them, honey.
I can't, Mork.
- I feel like the border patrol.
- Mind, you're the lady of the house.
The least you could do is look down your nose at them.
Um Well, I'd like you all to know that I'm very happy to meet all of you.
And, uh, I'm looking forward to getting to know each and every one of you personally.
A court jester?
Yes.
It's so hard to find one without a hump, Mind.
He's got great references, though.
He used to work for Marshal Tito.
Well, thank you, everyone.
Everyone grab a straw and go down to the swamp.
They love me, honey.
They really do.
You know, it's so hard to find good wit nowadays.
Yeah.
Mork, I don't know if I'm going to be able to get used to all this.
Oh, honey, now, come on.
We're still the same people we were when we lived in that little, tiny cracker-box apartment.
Mommy.
How about a couple of sets of tennis?
Mearth, where's that girl I hired to teach you tennis?
Tracy?
Tracy, come on in.
Come on, take big steps.
You hired Tracy Austin to teach Mearth, huh?
Tracy.
Come on, I'll show you how to blink back the tears when the line calls go against you.
You hired the number-one woman player in the world to teach Mearth?
Well, yes, we're getting murdered in doubles.
We had to do something.
Come on, hon, I've got Arnold Schwarzenegger waiting in the gym to give you a massage.
Okay, king me.
Excellent move, sir.
I didn't see that coming.
Oh, please, Quentin.
Are you kidding?
Mr. Magoo would've seen that one coming.
Why did you do that, Quentin?
- You let me win, didn't you?
- Yes, yes, sir.
- Why did you let me win?
- I value my job, sir, as someday I dream of opening my own truck-rental agency.
The game is over.
Great game.
Great game, ladies and gentlemen.
Good, good.
Can I get you a before-dinner Bosco?
No, you can't get me a before-dinner Bosco.
You know why?
You just like to say "Bosco".
To be sure.
I don't like him.
What's wrong, Mearth?
Oh, Mommy, I'm bored.
I've been all through this place.
All the rooms.
I'm tired and I miss Daddy.
I know, sweetheart.
I do too.
But I'm gonna talk to him about spending more time together, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
As a little backup, I made an appointment with him.
As a matter of fact, for Tuesday, in his office.
Gosh, I hope I can find his office.
Madam, there's a gentleman here to see you.
I believe he's called "Pops".
Oh!
Oh, great, send him in.
Send him in.
Very good.
Pops.
How are you, sweetheart?
Where's that genius son-in-law of mine?
- Mork buy you that coat?
- I guess so.
I found it in the trunk of the Rolls he gave me.
Is everybody going crazy around here?
Oh, honey, now, now, look, I know exactly what you're thinking.
I mean, I've always brought you up to appreciate the simple things in life, but, honey, you have to understand at the time I was poor and stupid.
Oh, no, Dad, listen to me.
This has just gone too far.
Look at us.
Look at you and me and especially Mork.
How dare you talk about Mork that way.
Thank you, Thomas.
Come back around 5.
We might need a ride to the front door.
Don't bother washing it.
We'll buy another one.
Oh, Mind, darling, how are you?
Big kiss.
Mwah!
Poppy, how are you?
How are you?
- Hello, son.
How are you?
- Oh, not too bad.
Though I lost a $100,000 today.
- Oh, stock market?
- No, hole in my pants.
Heh-heh.
Oh, hon, time to play our little game again.
- Right hand or left hand?
Come on.
- Mork, not again.
Oh, come on.
You know how it makes me feel.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Okay.
- Um, the right one.
- Behold.
Oh, there we go.
Little oyster droppings here.
- There we are, huh?
- Oh, what a guy.
Honey, I've always told you it's just as easy to marry a rich alien as it is to marry a poor graduate student.
- Mork.
Mork, we have to talk.
- Poppo.
Look, I don't want your presents.
I want you.
Just buying things isn't the answer to everything.
Neither is penicillin, but it sure helps a strep throat.
Mork, I mean, look at us.
A minute ago I walked in here and Mearth was playing a game of human checkers.
Did Quentin beat him?
I told him, lose or else go back to being Gaddafi's food taster.
I'll get a hold of him right now.
Don't you worry.
Yo!
Mork, this is what I'm talking about.
Mind, I Oh, yeah.
- Will you talk to him, please?
- Of course I will, honey.
Now, look, son, you're the man of the house now, and I think you should run it any way you want.
Thanks, Dad.
Mork, we're gonna have to talk about this later because I gotta get changed to go to work, but I wanna talk to you.
Oh, you don't have to because I resigned you.
- You resigned me?
- Well Well, what about my career?
Well, if it means that much to you, I'll just have to buy you NBC.
Yes, and he'll do it too.
He bought me the New York Philharmonic.
I knew Bernstein had a price.
Well, I don't want things just handed to me.
I wanna work for my career, for my success.
Well, once you have NBC, you'll have to earn every penny.
Olga.
Looking good.
Mork, what about Mearth?
You just can't raise a normal child in this kind of an environment.
Didn't you get my memo?
Next week I'm sending him to school in Switzerland.
Switzerland?
All right, now you've gone too far.
If that's too far, we'll send him to school in England.
Mork.
Listen to me.
Mork, I'm not happy here.
This isn't our home.
- Let's go back to our apartment.
- Well, this is our home, hon.
Well, it might be your home, but it's not for Mearth and me.
Well, now, wait a minute, hon.
Where are you going?
I'm going home to our little cracker-box apartment.
- Here.
- But wait, wait, wait.
You can't go now.
J.D. Salinger's coming over to shoot the bull.
She's gone, Pop.
Ah!
She'll get over it.
Oh, Pops.
Pops, reason with her.
Tell her opportunity only knocks once unless you're Neil Sedaka.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, Quentin.
- Will there be anything else?
- Oh, yes, yes.
Let's fly down to Rio.
It's Carnival time.
We'll put on those big heads and try and get in the car.
I'd love to, sir, but this is the day I spend with my family.
Oh, that's right.
Well, take care and have a good day.
- Good day, sir.
- Say hello to Carmelita.
I certainly will, sir.
Hello.
Well, self-reliance is fine, but I miss being waited on hand and foot.
I miss Daddy.
Well, I miss Daddy too, but even more, I miss being waited on hand and foot.
That's not very nice.
I don't care if it's very nice.
I'm spoiled rotten.
I know that.
This is no time for sensitivity.
- Shh.
- Da Mork.
- Mind.
- Oh, Mork, you came back.
I knew you would.
I knew you'd listen to what I said and realize that love is what makes our world go round.
Oh, hon, well, actually, that's real close because I came back to tell you that I'm going around the world, heh-heh, with my new love.
Mind, not only is she intelligent and well-read, she can spike a volleyball from here to Key West.
Kareem, eat your heart out.
Oh, no.
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, wake up.
Oh, I was sleeping.
Sleeping?
You were snoring so loud I had to have Mearth wake you up before you blew your adenoids across the room.
Mork, you're back.
I mean, you're home.
- I mean - Well, why shouldn't I?
I mean, my name's on the mailbox, my clothes are in the closet, my hair's on the soap.
Oh, you know, I had such a weird dream.
What kind of a dream?
Oh, I dreamed, um I dreamed that we lived in a big mansion with, um, butlers and maids and Tracy Austin.
And then you left us.
Oh, Mind, I mean, how can you dream that?
I'd never leave you.
I mean, with you my life has meaning, and without you, I'd just be another alien forced to do his own laundry.
It was just a silly dream.
I dreamed you could turn polyester into gold.
Heh.
Make gold?
I mean, it's impossible to make gold.
But diamonds are a snap.
Mearth, go in the garage, get those charcoal briquettes.
Mindy, you warm up the waffle iron.
I'll go get my Oil of Olay.
No, I don't want diamonds.
And I don't want gold.
Oh.
Well, how about some French toast?
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, O Potentate of Pasta.
Laying down on the job again, Mork?
Oh, no, sir.
I'm just getting in my mood for my report to you on dreams, a wonderful aspect of Earth behavior.
Dreams?
That's wonderful.
What are they?
They're little images that appear in an Earthling's mind when he's sleeping.
For example, sir, they come fast and furious, and sometimes they're out of sequence just like a Fellini film.
They can take you to wonderful, strange places.
- Ah!
- Oh!
- I see.
- Yes, sir.
Another frivolous Earth activity, like marching bands.
Oh, no, sir.
Dreams allow one to imagine strange and wonderful things.
The most precious dreams of all, sir, are the ones that give you a hope for tomorrow.
Till next week, sir, sweet dreams and na-no, na-no.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Na-no, na-no.
Daddy got his license.
Daddy got his license.
Okay, you lost, Grandpops.
Fork over.
Mork driving.
Who would believe it could happen here?
I keep thinking, one stiff wind four years ago and he would've landed in Kentucky.
Come on, Dad.
Mork went out, set a goal for himself and he achieved it.
I think you should be very proud of him.
Proud?
He just drove out of a gas station with the attendant still under the hood.
Made me laugh.
Ha, ha!
Oh, ho.
Well, I'm free.
I've got mobility now.
I have got my license, the key to joie.
Oh, ho.
Look at this.
Look at that.
Oh, I can finally take that "Just Married" sticker off my bicycle.
It was so hard dragging all those cans all these days.
Honey, look, don't think of me as your father.
Think of me as your savior.
You can't turn that maniac loose on the highway.
Will you have a little faith in Mork, please?
He didn't try to discourage you when you took up karate.
Oh, bless you, my little support system.
This would be a red-letter day for me if I hadn't taken such a lousy picture.
Amidst all of this excitement, I've written a poem.
Here it is.
Don't you read.
"My Dad" by Mearth McConnell.
Okay.
Now that my dad can drive And change a flat Please don't run over my new cat Bless you, son, bless you.
That was wonderful.
I loved your imagery and your meter.
You know, it's kind of reminiscent of Ubie or Robert Blake.
Oh, hello.
Hi, uh, I'm Bob Miller, your neighbor from across the street.
- Oh, hi.
- I seem to have gotten your mail.
- You're Mindy McConnell, aren't you?
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, and this is my husband, Mork.
- Oh, howdy.
Hi, Bob.
Ha-ha-ha.
I've seen you.
When are you gonna take down those Christmas lights?
- Wait a minute.
This is a subpoena.
- That's right.
Hey, isn't that great?
Bob, what a kinda guy you are.
Come over tomorrow, we'll wear shorts, stand by a fire and have a weenie roast.
Wait a minute.
Mork.
You just walked in here and lied to me.
You're a process server.
You just - You said you were our neighbor.
- I am.
I do live right across the street.
- By the way, can I borrow your rake?
- No.
Sorry you have to be going, neighbor.
Mind, come on.
You can't treat people like that.
I mean, if you do that, they'll be walking their dogs on our lawn.
- What's this all about, honey?
- I don't know.
Oh.
Ugh.
They want me to testify on that story I broke on the Hidden Springs Highway scandal.
You remember that one, Dad.
It was where the road crew told me the contractor was skimping on the codes and paying the state inspectors to look the other way.
I suppose they want you to tell them who supplied the information.
Mm-hm.
Mommy, I hope you're not going to release the name of the informant.
You should stand on the first amendment, on your rights as a journalist.
Too strong?
It's okay when Lou Grant says it.
I can identify with him.
We've got matching bodies.
I just can't believe that they would ask me to betray a confidence like that.
If it wasn't for me, they wouldn't have the story in the first place.
Look, honey, I respect your principles, but haven't journalists gone to jail for standing on the first amendment?
Oh, Dad, this is just a little construction scandal, not the Pentagon Papers.
No, they're not gonna do anything to me.
This is News Line and I'm Larry Carroll.
Today, KTNS reporter Mindy McConnell was cited for contempt of court and jailed for refusing to reveal her news source in the Hidden Springs bribery trial.
In other news, finalists prep for the Miss Nude Colorado contest.
Film at 10.
All right, come on, sister, move it.
You know, I've never been in jail before.
Yeah, life's tough.
I've never been to France.
Excuse me, but there's somebody else in there.
Maybe I could have a single cell.
Toots, this is jail, not the Love Boat.
Get in.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
One last question.
Um, are my things gonna be all right?
I mean, that's a very expensive sweater.
Don't put that on a hanger.
Oh, don't worry about it, honey.
I'll only wear it weekends.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Oh, you poor, dear child.
I know just how you feel.
Now you come right here and you sit down.
- Would you care for a Snickers?
- Oh.
No, thank you.
Suit yourself.
I was just trying to be friendly.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just I've never done time before.
I've never even been grounded.
Oh, I'm Mindy McConnell.
- And I'm Louise Bailey.
- Hi.
- My, but you are a cutie.
- Oh.
What in the world are you doing in a hell hole like this?
I don't know.
I didn't think things were gonna work out like this.
But my lawyer called and she said I should be out in a few hours.
- It's funny the way things happen.
- Yeah.
I'm in here because of a silly old parking meter.
You're kidding.
No, I went into a hardware store, and when I came out, there was a policeman writing me a ticket.
I don't believe it.
They threw you in jail for a parking ticket?
Well, in a roundabout way.
You see, when I put the shovel in the trunk, Walter's arm fell out.
Who's Walter?
My husband.
Well, what was he doing in the trunk?
Not much.
He was dead.
I warned him about his snoring for years, but he just wouldn't believe me.
So last night I took a pair of my very best panty hose and I wrapped them around his neck real tight.
You know, it was the first good night's sleep I've had in 31 years.
Well, you look well rested.
- You don't snore, do you, dear?
- No.
No.
No.
- Oh.
Oh.
- Oh.
Oh, my poor prison pooter.
My little San Quentin quail.
How are you?
Oh.
Oh, Mind, I mean, oh, the anguish, the degradation.
But cute little dress though.
Mork, I feel so humiliated, even though I know what I'm doing is right.
They took everything.
They took my clothes, and they took my wedding band.
And then they fingerprinted me and took mug shots and Oh, Mind Mork, that woman told me that she murdered her husband.
Oh, Mind, murdered her husband.
Come on, she looks like Mrs. Cleaver.
Hi.
Oh, Mork, how did Mearth take it?
Did you tell him?
He cried a lot.
He kept saying, "Mama's in the can, Mama's in the can".
- Oh.
- Oh, it's all right, though.
Then he packed all your stuff in boxes and he moved in the bedroom with me.
Well, you can tell him to unpack.
I'm gonna be out in a few hours.
I got things to tide you over in case you're here longer.
Here's some cigarettes to bribe the screws.
And, uh, here's some facial cream for an older woman.
And, uh, here's a harmonica.
Visiting hours are over.
- Let's go, Shorty.
- You got it, Butch.
- I miss you already.
- I miss you too, Mind.
Oh, and, lady, don't you worry, she makes a real good roommate.
Don't let her snore and keep you awake at night.
Um, heh, heh, that was a joke.
He was kidding.
I don't snore.
As a matter of fact, I don't even sleep.
Guard!
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, it's such a long step.
Oh, son, son, what's wrong?
- Oh, come, what's the matter now?
- What's the matter?
- Can't you see?
- Oh, look, well, sit down.
- Sit down.
- Oh, the life - Let's look at the boo-boo.
Sit down.
- No boo-boo.
Doggie bit me, and then there was a kitty bit me, and then there was a gray squirrel, then Tommy Leonard hit me with a bat.
Ow.
What did you do to make these people angry?
Just this.
Oh, son, well, let me look at your boo-boo.
Oh!
- Don't touch it.
- Oh, blood.
- Hey, hey, hey - I'll be back.
Wait now.
You've got to set an example for me.
Daddy, Daddy Here we go.
Don't you worry.
Let's put a little of this on.
Wait a minute.
Ow!
Aah!
Come on, if a dog bit you Come on.
It's my sore.
Let me do the "ows".
Ow.
Okay, if a dog bit you, we've gotta get a rabies shot for you.
I was kidding about that.
Doggie didn't bite me and a kitty didn't bite me.
But Bobby Leonard hit me with a bat.
Mommy never puts these on.
- She always puts - Well, listen, kid.
Your mommy's in the slammer busting rocks and breaking out license plates.
So I'm the best you got.
You better deal with me.
Oh, what am I talking about?
I miss Mommy too.
Boy, you need some sedation.
Oh.
Oh, son, son, I'm sorry.
Forgive me.
Can't you even think of helping me?
Boy, it's getting stiff.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Gangrene, gangrene.
That's it.
I'm not going to go very far.
Here we go.
Come on, son.
There we go.
- You up now?
- Yeah.
This is a biggie.
- Are you feeling better now?
- Yes, I am.
Oh, my gosh.
That's the doggie.
Maybe it's Bobby Leonard.
Mork I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
Don't tell me something's happened to Gene Rayburn.
- No, Mork.
- Oh, thank God.
You see, the judge has denied Mindy's petition for release.
She could be locked up for quite a while.
Oh, this is awful.
Mommy's not coming home for a while.
Oh, no, Mearth and I are gonna be plagued by relatives bringing over strange casseroles like tomato delight.
Gee, I'm like Daddy.
I'm real sorry about that, but take some extra green, looks like you lose again.
It's amazing.
Nine days and she hasn't improved at all.
- Oh, Mork.
- Oh, honey.
Oh, Mork, I don't think I can stand it another day.
Oh, darling, I think I have a plan, though, so you can say good-bye to the bars, the community showers - and the mystery meat.
- Oh, what?
Well, just tell them the name of your informant.
No.
I'm not gonna do that.
You tell me and I'll spill your guts for you.
Mork, you know how I feel about freedom of the press.
This is a basic constitutional question.
You mean like how Strom Thurmond keeps having children?
What?
Oh, Mork All right, get in here.
Easy, sister, or I'm gonna have to show you a few tricks I learned in the roller derby.
Oh.
Oh, Mind, come on now.
You gotta come home.
I can't bear you sleeping on anything that doesn't have a dust ruffle.
Believe me, I wanna come home.
Oh, Mork, it's not easy for me here.
When I go out in the exercise yard, the prisoners giggle when I shoot baskets.
I have to cut my meat with a spoon and, frankly, the screws here aren't very nice.
Move it, sister, you're on my bunk.
Do you believe I said that to her?
That woman would kill me for my lunch.
Oh, are they that good here?
Oh, Mind, I'm not just gonna sit down and let you rot in here.
Now come on, I'm gonna try and do something.
Oh, Mork, what can you do?
It's so complicated.
You wouldn't know where to start.
Oh, that doesn't matter, Mind.
I'm gonna go to the capitol, start knocking on doors until someone listens.
I'm gonna work through the system.
I am.
I've gone through enough red tape to gift wrap the Kremlin.
- How can I help you?
- Well, you see, my wife is a journalist and, well, she refused to give her sources so the judge found her in contempt.
She's been in the stir nine days and they haven't even taught her a trade.
That's an outrage.
Would you like some coffee?
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not alone in this, though.
I have a petition here signed by all 17 members of Miss LePons' tap class.
I'd like to thank you for taking the time and the trouble to bring this problem to my attention.
Before you go, I would like to present you with one of my souvenir pens.
If I wanted a pen and coffee, I would've mugged a waitress.
I don't need any more pens.
Look at this.
I've got pens coming out the klarn here.
Look at this.
Look at that.
Look at this one.
A Ronald Reagan pen.
It's got no point.
Come on now.
Come on, you're an elected official.
I mean, you've gotta help people.
Do more than open up super markets and have mediocre-looking daughters.
There's gotta be something you can do.
Well, okay, the only viable solution that I can think of is a shield law.
Oh.
Is that the law where it forces a woman to wear pads to protect her delicate dress?
No, it protects a journalist from having to disclose their sources.
Uh, twenty-six states have some sort of shield law, but Colorado doesn't.
However, they don't have our mile-high taffy.
Well, how about this for a campaign for you, huh?
I mean, how about this?
"Free the shiksa one".
- That'll work.
- Yeah.
And who knows?
In no time, Mindy'll be home changing the vacuum bag.
Okay, listen, I know what I can do.
Of course, this is gonna take time.
This isn't Fotomat.
I'll have to draft a bill, and then, uh, push it through the right channels.
- Right.
Right.
- Well, you know what?
- I won't take my Christmas vacation.
- Bless you.
- I'll ram this through - Ram it home.
Yes, sir.
And you know what?
She'll probably be out in about two or three years.
Two or three years?
By that time Brooke Shields' eyebrows would have met.
Hey, listen, that's not so That's not so bad.
You know, it took me two full terms just to get this swivel chair?
Then you can't get my wife out of jail?
No.
But my father could've.
I'm sorry.
It's not that I don't care.
It's just that, well, I don't wanna make waves.
Oh.
You don't wanna make waves?
Well, you politicians You politicians are all alike.
I should have known better.
I mean, from the same system that gave us Spiro Agnew.
Happy birthday to you Hey.
It's not my birthday.
What are you doing?
Oh, will you listen to her?
She's so shy.
She lies about her age and her SAT score.
You know, you've got a funny little man here.
A cake in the shape of a saw.
Ha-ha-ha!
Play along with her.
We're making our own laws here, just like in Haiti.
Mork, whatever you're up to, please don't.
Oh, she's gonna perk up so much when we make those little balloon animals.
Oh, good.
You know, we haven't had a party here since the police chief had his heart attack.
Party!
Whoo!
Party!
Whoo!
Well, Mind Well, I saw this cake.
It's the best one I'd seen bar none.
Hope it doesn't make you break out.
Heh, heh.
Break out.
Heh, heh.
Well, make a wish, hon.
I did, but you're probably going through with this anyway.
A couple of weeks without her Waterpik and she still hasn't lost her spirit.
- Well, time to cut the cake.
- Yeah.
Oh, but there's an old tradition that the birthday girl gets to cut the cake.
Well, we have a little tradition here too.
Prisoners with knives get shot on sight.
- I want my piece of cake now.
- Oh, yeah.
What kind of filling is that?
I asked for rum raisin.
Oh, how'd that?
Oh, the nerve.
Oh, boy.
I'm gonna call my consumer advocate about this.
Whoa.
Watch out for this one.
Oh, that really Oh, what a bummer.
Watch out for Hey, wait a second.
Did you really marry that guy or are you just breaking him in for somebody else?
Come back here.
Psst.
It's me.
Hop on the Midnight Express.
Come on.
I want you to stop this right now.
Oh, Mind, come on now.
I need you.
Mearth needs you.
And, besides, we've got tickets to see Sophisticated Ladies.
Now come on.
- No.
- Oh, Mind, listen.
I mean, it's clam night at Howard Johnson's.
Mind, come on now, please.
- Well, stand back.
Stand back.
- No.
- No, Mind, come on, stand back.
- Stop it.
- Mork, put that finger down.
- Mind Come on, Mind.
Come on.
My car's outside, engine's running.
You don't wanna miss clam night.
Come on, let's go.
Mork, it's against the law to break people out of jail.
Well, so is dancing with sheep, but people still do it.
Mork, oh, I wanna go with you, but I can't.
Oh, Mork, don't you see, this is This is my one chance to prove that my beliefs are more than just words.
My mind's made up.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying here.
Are you the same woman that broke the Pritikin Diet after only three hours?
Yes.
But that's different, Mork.
Sometimes you have to make sacrifices for your principles.
Oh, come on, you see that, don't you?
Oh, no.
Come on, Mind.
Oh, no.
All right, freeze, shrimp.
You boys play handball someplace else.
- Oh, no.
No, that's not gonna work.
- No, no.
- You're under arrest.
- Oh, please.
No, no, wait, wait.
This is a mistake.
This is a misunderstanding.
Come on, where's your sense of humor?
Well, Mind, look at the good side.
I'm here, you're here, and if they get Mearth on a juvenile rap, we'll be a happy family again.
You know, you could've saved yourself the trouble.
Pollyanna here's been released.
- Your source finally spilled the beans.
- Ah.
You're kidding.
I'm free.
Oh, God, I can't wait to get out of here.
Oh, but, Mind, you ex-cons are so insensitive.
Mind, what about me?
- Well - Come on, toots, let's move it.
Um Mork Oh, Mind, you can't leave me here.
You know what happens to a pretty face in jail.
I'm gonna go straight home and call the lawyer, all right?
- All right.
- Okay, I'll call You might need this.
- Oh, all right.
- And don't eat the macaroni.
It's bad.
Wait a minute.
What am I feeling sorry about?
There's no jail in this town that could hold me on clam night.
A souvenir.
Born free All those years in the roller derby I knew I should have worn a helmet.
This is News Line and I'm Mindy McConnell.
Heavy rains today bring flash flood warnings to Colgate County.
Today, Denver Gazette reporter Judd Smith was cited for contempt and jailed for refusing to reveal his news sources in the Arvada kickback trial.
In a related story, a bill to provide a shield law for journalists died in committee.
And the manhunt continues for escaped pantyhose strangler, Louise Bailey.

Adiós, you fine young thing.
I should never have given her that Fernando Valenzuela poster.
Hello, Mom?
Mom?
Mom, can you hear me?
Oh, excuse me.
I'm awfully sorry, my friend.
I was just trying to call my mother on Neptune.
Oh, you're from Neptune?
You don't know Bobby Gleepglow, do you?
Are you kidding?
I dated his sister.
Are you kidding?
That gorgeous bald girl?
- Uh-huh!
- Whoa!
My name is Kalnik, but please, call me Kal, okay?
Everybody does except my car salesman who calls me "guy".
"Hey, guy, what you doing?
Guy".
Well, na-no.
I'm Mork from Ork.
- Oh!
I'm sorr - Oh.
Sorry, I have been on Earth for so long, I'm starting to pick up their primitive customs.
You know, lately I've even started raising my arms on roller coasters: - Oh!
You live on Earth?
Me too.
- Mm-hm.
- No.
- What do you do?
Well, I'm an observer, and I enjoy folk dancing.
- I'm an observer also.
- Yeah?
Yup, in my spare time I'm a homemaker, though.
Yeah, I like to take care of my son, and one day hope to make big money stuffing envelopes.
- You're married, huh?
- Yeah.
Me too, but don't laugh, okay?
- She's an Earth girl.
- Oh!
- Whoa.
So's mine.
- No.
- Does yours use Noxzema?
- Yes!
Does yours buy those little soaps that she won't let you wash with?
- Oh, what a small galaxy.
- Oh, what a small galaxy.
So you dated Bobby Gleepglow's sister?
Yes, have you heard from her?
Well, I don't wanna spread any rumors, but I heard that she's turned amphibious.
No.
Cootchie-cootchie.
- Yeah.
- Ha-ha!
I'm really glad it's raining.
That bully that keeps beating me up across the street, he has to stay in too.
Shh!
Mearth, Daddy's working.
Are you kidding?
He isn't working.
He watches Love Boat the same way.
Well, when he watches Love Boat he keeps mumbling: "Is Dennis Cole on again"?
Why don't you go and get out of your wet slicker?
No, I don't wanna get out of my wet slicker, okay?
- I wanna stay in my wet slicker.
- Mearth Celeste.
I've asked you never to come aboard.
Not at a time, we're entering heavy gales, northeast by southwest by southeast by southwest by northeast.
Go below.
Take those groceries, help yourself.
Be careful of the cabin boy.
He's small and tiny, and he bites.
Oh!
Look at those: Oh, seaweed.
Who knows, it might be in a Nantucket museum.
Save it.
It was aboard the Pequot.
When will we see the whales, sir?
When will we see the whale?
Well, you can't miss it.
They're quite large.
They have Gregory Peck on it, just like this: Your little girl, she'll be on the bow, just like this: - Captain, sir.
- Yes?
- Captain, sir?
- Yes.
The storm is breaking.
Is it?
Yes.
I think you should go and change into your jammies.
- I think you're right.
- Good.
The crew was out of line anyway.
- They were talking mutiny, Mommy.
- Mearth.
Mind?
Oh, Mind, Mind, put away those groceries and do something to your hair.
Put some magnetic beads in because we're stepping out with a terrific couple.
Mork, I told you I'm not going to the Salvation Army luau with Exidor and his sister.
Mind, that's next week.
Tonight we're going out with our new best friends, Kal and Tracy Andrews.
Now, I wish you'd checked with me first.
You know what happens every time we go out with another couple.
We can never get close enough to them to stay friends.
I mean, they brag about their kids, and we have to pass Mearth off as a visiting professor from Ceylon.
Mindy, come on.
We won't have to do any of that stuff for these people.
Why?
Are they blind?
You don't see.
They're just like us.
I mean, she's from Chicago, and he's from Neptune.
- There's life on Neptune?
- Well, not after dark.
Well, except for one little rib place in the inner city.
They also serve seafood.
You can get my man, lobster.
What's happening?
Now, this couple, they are normal, right?
I mean, Kal doesn't have three heads or eat wood or anything?
No, I don't eat wood, although mahogany does make great croutons.
And they never get soggy.
- Hi, I'm Kal.
- Hi, I'm embarrassed.
- Hey, paisano.
- Hey.
Kal, I'd like you to meet my main gal here, the light of my life, the one I give my extra pickle to.
And I would like you to meet the only girl in the universe for me.
Unfortunately, she couldn't make it, so I had to bring my wife.
He always says that.
Oh, I'm so happy to meet both of you.
You know, my favorite cousin's name is Mindy.
What a coincidence.
Mindy's name is Mindy.
Mindy, Mork tells me you're in television.
Maybe Maybe you can answer this for me.
Why is there no Channel 1?
Oh.
Oh, oh, oh, uh Well, see, uh, when television was first invented, uh No, see, the FCC has special frequency regulations and, uh I haven't the faintest idea.
The search goes on.
She may not know, but she can adjust the vertical hold, - if you catch my drift.
- Oh!
Well, how did you two meet?
Well, I was working as a nurse's aide when Kal came in with re-entry burns.
Oh, it's okay.
And out of all the girls on Earth, he chose me.
You know, Mindy, we must be the two luckiest girls since the other two Mandrell sisters.
- Your champagne, sir.
- Oh, thank you, Chuck.
- I'll do the honors.
Thank you.
- Very good, sir.
I think you'll like this one.
It's from the Chateau region of Arkansas.
"Eau de Billy Bob".
Heh.
See, it says, "Bottled somewhere near the house".
Squeal!
Heh-heh.
Oh, there we go.
Little touch there.
There we are.
Whoo!
Party!
Boom!
You are my kind of guy, Mork.
I never had a friend like you, Kal.
You know, we are gonna be closer than Karen Black's eyes.
Oh, Mork, why don't we sit down and talk seriously for a moment, okay?
I think you're right, Kal.
How about this?
Famine, flood and Alexander Haig, huh?
Mork, have you ever noticed that this planet offers opportunities that a couple of guys like us could really take advantage of?
I mean, aren't you tired of just sitting around being an observer when it would be so easy to just step in and take a piece of the action?
You and I could really accomplish something very significant here.
Oh.
Really?
You mean, like change the smell of tar?
That's not exactly what I had in mind.
Wow.
Company.
Are you anybody I should know?
Kal, Tracy, this is our little bundle of joy, our bouncing baby-man, Mearth.
- Hey.
- Hi, Mearth.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Yes, and he's even And he's even cuter when he's upstairs asleep in his bed, - aren't you, Mearth?
- Oh, uh, uh-oh!
Come on.
What's the good of having a kid if he can't come down and show off for company a little bit?
Mearthy, do something wonderful, that thing that Daddy loves so much.
These slippers are a cheat.
Heh.
Whoa, eh, you're a little boy.
He is so fun.
It's amazing.
- Isn't he something?
- Incredible.
Very talented.
Well, if you like that, how about my impression of Gary Cooper?
Why don't you do Gary Cooper sleeping in the bunkhouse?
Hmm?
Okay.
Okay, Mommy.
Well, I'll be moseying along.
I'll be going to the bunkhouse.
I'm a little uneasy about that because of those bunkies.
Tomorrow at 12:10-30, they're gonna hang me.
I hope the guy has a sense of humor.
Last year he used a rubber band.
You kids wait here.
I'll be right back.
Mearth won't go to bed unless I show him a picture of the bogeyman getting on a plane.
Oh, you go right ahead.
Are you satisfied with the Orkan?
He may be a feeb, but he still has great powers, though they're no match for mine.
- I can mold him into whatever I want.
- What about the woman?
She's of no use to us.
She'll have to be eliminated.
And the child?
The son, Mearth, is nothing but a useless mutant, and he does a lousy Gary Cooper.
- Oh!
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
Oh.
Ha-ha.
We were just talking about how precious your child is.
No, you weren't.
I heard exactly what you said.
How dare you talk about our son like that?
- I think you two had better leave.
- Oh.
Whoa-ho.
What's wrong, Mind, did they use those little soaps of yours?
They just called your son a mutant.
How can you say something so cruel about a special boy - that's never hurt anybody?
- Oh, hey, space-bro, lighten up.
What are you getting so upset about?
I mean, we have important business to talk about.
We have nothing to discuss.
You should leave right now.
Look, I didn't wanna say this, but let's face it, he's nothing but a hefty half-breed.
No one calls my son a mutant.
You should take a hike.
You could have been my ally.
But you've made your choice.
You'll live to regret this, Orkan, but not for long.
Tracy, come.
Oh, remember, Mindy, you owe me that carrot-cake recipe.
Night.
Well, we'll show them.
Give them your grandmother's carrot-cake recipe.
They'll starve to death trying to read her handwriting.
Mommy, you'd better hurry up and get out here.
It's time you get out here.
If you take longer, I'm gonna start getting interested in girls.
I know you're in there, Mommy.
I know you're in there.
Now, I'm going to count to ten.
If you're not out here by the time I count to ten, I'll make a lot of long-distance calls at random.
Like Berlin, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Fayetteville.
Mommy.
Okay, I'll use the old saver.
- Oh, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
Ah!
- Mearth.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
- My tiny heart left my body.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
I've been waiting downstairs.
I thought you'd slipped out for a moment.
I was irrigating my ant farm.
We'll wanna get to the park before the winos wake up.
- Here, here's your jacket.
- Okay.
Oh, you're gonna love flying your kite in the park, Mearth, - and running.
- I don't wanna I don't wanna run.
I'll just walk briskly.
Oh, hi.
Heh.
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.
- Good.
We're going.
- No, you're not!
Oh, there's someone following me!
Mork, you have been doing this for three days.
Now, no one is following you.
So Kal made a few idle threats.
That doesn't mean he's gonna do anything.
Look at Reagan.
Mind, you don't know Neptunians.
They end their national anthem with a human sacrifice.
Mork, you can stay in here and be afraid of your shadow, or you can come with us.
- Bye.
- Okay.
Come on, Mearth.
- Bye.
- See you, Dad.
There's no wind out there anyway.
Mork, are you in there?
It's Tracy.
Please, open the door.
I can't.
My Mommy and Daddy are sleeping.
Oh, Mork, please, I have to talk to you.
Let me in.
I'm alone.
Oh, sure.
And Tip O'Neill wears tapered shirts.
If you won't believe me, why don't you check for yourself?
- Please.
- All right.
I think I'll just do that.
Kal, are you out there?
Kal, are you out there?
Well, that's good enough for me.
- Oh, Mork.
Oh, Mork.
- Oh, it's all right.
Mork, you were the only person I could turn to.
My life has fallen apart.
I've left Kal.
I should have known he was evil when he laughed at Old Yeller.
- Oh!
That macho pig.
Macho pig.
- Yeah.
Oh I have tried to be a good wife.
I washed his clothes.
I darned his socks.
I even jogged for him so he could sleep late.
Oh, that's all Oh, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.
There we go.
There we go.
Okay, there we go.
Oh, come on, it's all right.
Yeah.
- Oh, Mork.
- Feel better?
Yeah.
You're so sweet.
Heh.
I have to tell you, Kal didn't meet you by accident.
It was all part of his plan.
He was just using you.
I feel so cheap.
He just wanted to pick your brain to find out what your ultimate mission was here on Earth.
Well, originally, I was sent to observe the culture, but now I just want to see if Nightline knocks off Carson.
Why do you want to know?
Why?
Oh.
Oh, Mork, I'm just being silly.
It's just that I haven't had a chance to chat with anyone since Kal left me.
Kal left you.
I thought you said you left Kal.
I did?
Well, we both left at the same time.
Heh.
Wait a minute.
You're trying to pull the Dacron over my eyes here.
Wait.
Who do you think I am?
The American people?
Come on, now.
Oh, my little Morkie Pie.
What difference does it make?
Just as long as we're together.
Oh.
Heh-heh.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I know I'm irresistible, but I have a wife and child.
I can't support them, but I've got them.
No, no, no.
I just wanna know what pleases you.
I wanna know your joys, - your problems.
- No.
Stand back!
No.
Well, the only problems I have is I really can't find a decent FM station.
No, no, no, please, no, no, no, please, no, no, no, wait, time-out.
Now, let's look at this rationally.
You and I are married people.
And besides, I can't keep this up.
I mean, I'm beginning to hyperventilate.
Please.
- Good, I just love a heavy breather.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Daddy, are you telling her a story?
- What is going on?
- Oh, Mind.
Mind, Mind, Mind.
Mind, Mind, you know me.
Nothing is going on.
Nothing is going on here.
You know me.
I'm straighter than Chinese children's bangs.
- Mearth, go to your room.
- Ma I still think that someday this will make a very sensitive movie.
No, Mind, now, come on.
No, no, no.
Mind, you know I'd never cheat on you.
Except in Monopoly when I'm the banker.
Mork, I'm sure that there's a perfectly logical explanation.
Oh, there sure is.
And you've got five seconds to give it to me.
Oh, no pressure.
Oh, Mind, she just can't keep her hands off me.
That's not the right thing to say.
I know.
Tracy, come on, now.
I mean, tell her, tell her.
Your marriage may be over, but we just got our monogrammed towels.
You take your hands off Ah!
You didn't have to take her literally.
I have a feeling she's not from Chicago.
What a pair of feebs.
I am programmed to extract and transmit information for my master, Kal.
You're an android.
Affirmative.
And I am also a bomb.
Oh, what a difference A bomb!
Hide!
Gosh, it's incredible.
What a mess.
Are you all right?
Oh, Mommy, I wouldn't count on getting my cleaning deposit back on this place.
Everything okay, Mork?
Mork.
- You still think I'm paranoid, Mind?
- No.
Kal is after us.
Oh We gotta find someplace where he won't go.
- Where?
- I don't know.
I was hoping you'd know.
I can't leave.
My guppy's expecting.
I'll go get the photo album and your jewelry.
- You get the Veg-O-Matic.
- No.
We gotta get out of here before Kal comes back.
- Yeah, you're right.
Come on, son.
- Guppy's on her own.
Come on.
This stuff will all be here when we come back.
I don't know, Mork.
I have a feeling we're never gonna see this place again.
Come on, we gotta get out of here.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Na-no, na-no.
- Mom.
Mom.
- You're from Neptune?
My name is Kalnik, but please call me Kal.
You live on Earth?
Me too.
What do you do?
Well, I'm an observer, and I enjoy folk dancing.
I'm an observer also.
- What a small galaxy.
- What a small galaxy.
Years ago, I never even knew there were aliens, - and here I am, sitting with two.
- I know what you mean.
I would like to make a toast here.
A friendship that spans the universe.
Oh.
Mm-hm.
Are you satisfied with the Orkan?
I can mold him into whatever I want.
- What about the woman?
- She's of no use.
- She'll have to be eliminated.
- The child?
The son, Mearth, is nothing but a useless mutant.
No one calls my son a mutant.
Take a hike.
What are you getting so upset about?
We have important business.
- We have nothing to discuss.
Leave.
- You'll live to regret this, Orkan.
- You're so sweet.
- What is going on?
- Mind, you know I'd never cheat.
- Take your hands off Ah!
- You're an android.
- And I'm also a bomb.
A bomb!
Hide.
- Are you okay, Mork?
- Still think I'm paranoid, Mind?
Kalnik's after us.
Gotta go someplace where he won't find us.
I have a feeling we're never gonna see this place again.
Oh, boy, Arizona's beautiful, isn't it, Mind?
Painted deserts, purple mountains.
- It's gonna be a great place to die.
- All right.
Now, I didn't say anything when you said you saw a cactus - take down our license plate number.
- I did.
But enough is enough, Mork.
We've put a lot of distance between us and Kalnik.
Mind, don't you underestimate Kal.
He's got a Porsche.
This is an emergency situation.
We need you.
Okay?
So don't fall apart, like you do when your potato chip has a little green on it.
Oh, I do hate that.
But you're right.
Gonna hang tough, gotta be cool.
You're right.
Agent 46 to Kalnik.
We've located the alien.
Shall we take him?
No, keep him in sight, but save him for me.
Ha-ha!
Go.
There you go.
I don't believe you, Mommy.
You're asking an innocent child to sleep here in this dirt?
Mearth, I've explained to you.
This is sort of a spur of the moment camping trip, and you're just gonna have to bear with us.
Okay?
Oh, that's all right for you to say.
You've got the air mattress.
We all agreed that the coin toss was fair, all right?
- Night-night.
Pleasant dreams.
- Night-night.
Sure.
And I've got this Gila monster for a pillow.
- Mind?
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ah!
- Mork.
- Oh, look at that.
Georgia O'Keeffe's hood ornament.
Talk about the Scarsdale Diet.
Whoa.
Oh, Mind.
- Very funny.
- Oh, come on now, Mind.
What are you upset about?
You got the air mattress.
And all I get is the tumbleweed as a pillow.
Mork, we have a dollar-56 left to our names.
Now, we've gotta stay out of sight till we get a message to Dad to bring us more money.
But to tide us over, I think we're gonna have to pawn our wedding rings.
Oh, Mind, no.
I mean, that's a symbol of our love and commitment.
I mean, couldn't you just sell your hair?
Look what's happened to us.
Mork, the biggest thing we had to worry about yesterday was trying to find a decent plumber, and now we're running for our lives.
- I'm scared.
- Oh, so am I. Come here, come here.
I should've known better than to trust somebody from Neptune.
On Neptune, Pia Zadora would've won the Oscar.
Oh It's so hard to stay depressed around you.
Oh, Mind, I guess that's why Ingmar Bergman doesn't come over and play tennis anymore.
Five-love.
Will you look at this place?
Looks like Sylvester Stallone's library.
Who cares?
It's a better place to hide than Edna's Reptile Dinner Theater.
I loved it when that iguana sang "Oklahoma".
I'm hungry.
Where do you suppose the coffee shop is?
The last thing I had to eat was a Junior Mint, and that was stuck to the sole of my shoe.
Yeah, but you didn't share it, you wretched little churl.
All right, let's not start this again.
Mearth, what we're gonna do, we'll check in and go to the coffee shop, and then when Dad comes, we'll be able to pay for it.
Come on, everybody, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
All right.
This is the last lap.
Enjoy it.
Okay, this is the last stretch.
Oh, terrific.
Let's all give ourselves a Hidden Hills hand for the splendid job we did on our run today.
And let's try to forget about what happened to Angela.
Time for lunch, everybody.
Today's meal is a carrot stick and a picture of a potato.
Let's go.
Remember, you can never be too rich or too thin.
Ha-ha!
I have a feeling this place is a fat farm.
Yeah, and what a bumper crop.
One, two, three, four, soon you'll fit through the door.
I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy Okay, everybody, let's shake it out now.
All right, everybody in a semi-circle.
Come on.
Good.
Okay.
Time now for sharing and caring.
Stella, would you like to begin?
- Do you gotta stand?
- Yes.
Okay, give me a minute.
Come on, Stella, you can do it.
Well, my name is Stella Benson, and I have a weight problem.
But I feel good about myself, because I've lost 17 pounds.
And now, when I go on an airplane, they'll allow the other passengers to take luggage.
Thank you, Stella.
Okay, who wants to go next?
- Dinner!
- Dinner!
Mork, it's been three days of starving.
I can't take much more of this.
Yeah, it's almost like Mahatma Ghandi opened up a burger stand.
- Mommy.
Mommy.
Daddy.
- Oh, what, Mearth?
There's a woman after me.
She's from Indiana, and she's a widow.
And she wants me to take over her late husband's shoe factory.
A whole factory?
Son, you have my blessing.
Mearth, don't worry about it.
Just try to stay in large groups.
Around here that's not hard to do.
Oh, my looks have become a curse.
- Mork, Mindy, are you all right?
- Oh, Dad.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
We didn't want to drag you into all of this, but there's no one else to turn to.
Well, honey, what's a father for?
I'm just glad you're not hurt.
Oh, Dad, I hate to be the clichéd son-in-law, but where are our bucks?
- Oh, here.
- Oh, bless you.
Hey, hey, what's your hurry?
I haven't even seen my little grandson yet.
Look at this mondo dinero.
You must have gotten a great settlement in your hair-transplant suit.
- Dad, we don't need all this money.
- Oh, that's all right.
I can afford to be generous.
After all, you'll never live to spend it.
Kalnik.
Oh Oh!
Oh, Mind, we're not gonna hit our target weight after all.
All right, now, what has four legs and ten seconds to live?
Wait a minute, I know this one.
Uh It's I think it's Sounds like Oh, would you shut up, Ork breath?
Both of you, put your fingers in your ears.
Go ahead.
And stand on one foot.
Boy, do you look stupid.
Why do you want to kill us?
Because you're the only ones that can throw a monkey wrench into my plans.
I have to kill all three of you and then get back for my haircut by 4.
- Now, where's the little mutant?
- No, not Mearth.
He's just a child.
Well No, I'm gonna kill him.
- You're insane.
- I'm just a product of your sick society.
When I came to Earth, all I wanted to do was open a little restaurant.
I had trouble getting a liquor license.
I decided it would be easier to take over the planet instead.
Well, I'm glad you shared this moment with us because it probably makes you feel better about blowing us away.
- Yes, it does.
- Oh, really?
Oh, Mork, Mork, if only you had my vision of the future.
If only you had one tenth of my power and brilliance instead of the ambition of a substitute teacher.
I infiltrated your government.
I took an ineffective arm of a consumer protection agency and turned them into my own personal army.
I told them that you were the aliens threatening the planet.
Catchy twist, isn't it?
Thank you.
There was a draft.
All right, all right.
- Any last words?
- Oh, Mork.
Mind.
I'm so glad we had this time together Just to have a laugh and sing a song Seems we just got started And before we know it Comes the time We have to say, "So long" - Okay, hold it right there.
- Ah!
Don't shoot me, Mindy.
Don't shoot me, Mindy.
Don't shoot me.
Get out of the way, you dumbbell.
- Okay, you hold it right there.
- Oh, no, you wouldn't fire that gun.
Oh, yes, I would.
No, no, no.
I'll get this back to you by Tuesday.
Kal, I'm warning you.
All you Earth women are good for is standing in line at the movies while your husbands park the car.
- Stay back.
I'm not kidding.
- You don't have the guts.
Yes, I do.
I just don't have the instructions.
Mind, Mind, I'm open.
Here.
Mind, was that you or the Memorex?
That was my mother's ray gun.
All right, you just bought yourself another minute to live.
- But, oh, is it gonna hurt.
- Oh, yeah?
What about this, huh?
Oh, your dinky, little finger is no match for my telekinetic powers.
You did it now, Jack.
That's it.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Howard, boxing has been good to me.
You didn't fight.
Come on, you gotta get mad, Mork.
You can think of things you hate.
Yeah, yeah, post-nasal drip and your perm.
Yeah.
My perm?
What do you mean, my perm?
Oh, I'm teasing now.
Come on.
Come on.
Bachelor number one, are you employed?
Yeah.
Mind, look, little birds everywhere.
Okay.
Okay, this has been fun, gang, but it's death time.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, Mommy, Daddy, what's this?
The feeb.
Kalnik.
Oh, please, don't hurt them.
Who would ever adopt a 200-pound orphan?
Mearth, quick, run for it.
Drat.
That's all right, son.
Maybe you and I could band together against him.
We'll be the best father and son team since Raymond and Aaron Burr.
Go on, Mind.
We can't hold out for very long.
Save yourself.
No, I'm not going anywhere without you.
Oh, bless you, Mind.
The ultimate Caucasian.
I turned him into a statue.
Well, it's all over.
We might as well go home.
- I guess.
- I guess you're right.
Son, we did it.
Oh, you little pooterette.
- Give your daddy five.
- Yeah.
So long, honky.
What did you mean when you said you didn't like my perm?
Well, I do like your perm, Mind.
It's just too much.
It's wonderful.
It's the heat of battle.
Mind, come on, I never said I hated your hair.
I just liked it when it was, well, attractive.
Oh, great, so now I'm not attractive?
I never said that.
Did I, son?
The other day, didn't I casually remark how attractive your mother was?
No, I believe you said that she looks like Marty Allen in a wind tunnel.
Son, I worship Marty Allen.
He's a lovely comic.
You know, "Hello there".
- Mork?
- Mind?
I'm not gonna argue about this.
I'm too happy to be alive to be as mad as I should be.
Off the record, Mommy, I'm on your side.
Oh, those men!
Whoever they are, they're not gonna be able to follow us over this terrain.
- Mork, we have to talk.
- All right.
- But not in front of M-E-A-R-T-H.
- Who is Me-arth?
Me, Mearth.
I'm just trying to figure out how I can get that air mattress back.
Mork, nothing is gonna stop Kalnik's men.
They think you're the alien who is secretly out to take over the world, and they're just gonna keep hunting until they find you.
Well, there's only one solution, I guess.
You and Mearth take the jeep and go east, and I'll go west and try and keep them on my trail.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna leave you.
Oh, bless you, hon.
Oh Well, let's see.
- Well, there's one other solution.
- What?
It's very dangerous though.
Mearth?
- Yes?
- Come here.
- This has to be a family decision.
- Oh, we're gonna have steak tonight?
Son.
You see, there's only one choice, but I think it's the only way.
I have to tell the whole world that I'm an alien.
That way they know I've got nothing to hide.
Mind, that's the only way.
I've gotta go public.
Mork, for as long as I've known you, this is the one thing I've been the most scared of.
You have no idea how people are gonna act, or how they're gonna treat you.
I don't know.
Mind, come on now.
Oh, Mind, I've lived on this planet for four years, and most of the people are very good.
I mean, if they can accept Diana Ross as Dorothy, they can go for me.
We interrupt our regularly scheduled programming to bring you this live report of national interest from the Federal Building in Los Angeles.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary General of the United States.
Good afternoon.
I have been asked to make the following announcement.
Five days ago, the United States government became aware of the existence of an extra-terrestrial being, living on this planet.
Since that time, his origin has been verified by our nation's leading scientific and military experts, who are present today.
He will speak to you now.
- Just like you rehearsed it.
- Oh.
Hello there.
I'm Mindy McConnell, and I'm married to Mork here.
Oh, go Dodgers.
Um, Mork came to this planet four years ago from a place called Ork.
Ork is a very nice planet.
It's a lot like Earth, as a matter of fact.
It has gravity and oxygen and dog races.
And now I want to introduce to you all someone who's proved to me that life on other planets is not only peaceful but compassionate and loving.
Mork.
Uh Good evening, Mr. And Mrs. America, and all couples who are just living together.
- Just tell them about yourself.
- Okay, you're right.
Yes, I am an alien, and cold pizza gives me gas.
Um, I know it's gonna be difficult for many of you to accept me because I'm different.
But, hey, I really pose no threat to you.
Hey, I'm just like all of you except I have three hearts and no liver.
And who likes liver anyway?
Uh, to be very blunt, I'm throwing myself at your mercy.
See, all we want to do is live here in peace.
I This world has given me very, very wonderful things.
My wife, my son.
And now I think it's time for me to give you something back.
You see, the universe, it's a very, very big place.
But if you accept me today, I think we take the first step to make it a little bit smaller.
Uh, it's a great opportunity.
Let's not blow it.
I don't know what else to say, except na-no.
Mork, your days are numbered.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Na-no, na-no.
Mom.
- Mom.
- You're from Neptune?
My name is Kalnik, but please call me Kal.
You live on Earth?
Me too.
No one calls my son a mutant.
Take a hike.
You'll live to regret this, Orkan.
Take your hands off Ah!
- You're an android.
- And I am also a bomb.
A bomb!
Hide!
I have a feeling we're never gonna see this place again.
Why do you want to kill us?
Because you're the only ones that can throw a monkey wrench into my plans.
Nothing is gonna stop Kalnik's men.
They think you're the alien who's out to take over the world and they're gonna keep hunting until they find you.
There's only one choice, but I think it's the only way.
I have to tell the world I'm an alien.
That way they know I've got nothing to hide.
That's the only way.
I've gotta go public.
Mork is the most famous man in the world, and I'm offering you your own prime time television show.
What?
Oh, Mind, this is so fast.
Four days ago I was having dinner with a lady friend of mine at my favorite Italian restaurant.
I won't give it a plug, but you know which one.
The one where the Pope eats when he's in town, so you know it's good.
Anyway, in the bar the TV's blasting away about, uh, some alien from another planet.
Well, I'm not buying it at first, but for gosh darn it, uh, I turn out to be wrong.
Anyway, he's here with us tonight.
He truly is a spaceman from another planet and he's here to tell us about it with his wife.
Will you please welcome to the stage Mr. Mork and Mindy McConnell?
Oh.
Oh.
Hi, Tom.
Ha, ha.
You know, back on my planet, the green room is flesh colored.
- So you're the guy from Ork.
- Yep.
Sometimes I get the feeling that half of my staff here is from Ork.
Ha-ha-ha.
I really don't think so, Tom.
Reading from the papers, uh, we know that apparently you are an alien, but you married him, why?
Two billion guys on this planet, they're not all good lookers, but you couldn't find one that you liked, for God's sakes?
No, um, it's not like that at all.
It's just that Mork is very special and loving and he doesn't know the meaning of the word "deceit".
Remarkable, remarkable.
Now I understand that you have a son and his name is Steve?
- Mearth.
- Mearth.
Good work, research.
Well, I think that's an excellent time to bring out young Mearth.
Uh, will you please welcome to the stage Mr. Mearth McConnell?
Mork, you're gonna have yourself a six-footer here.
Ha-ha-ha.
Hello, Tom.
Are you ready for this, Mr. Tom?
It's super neat.
Tell me about the stars and Uh, so, big fella, you age backwards, is that it?
You're really old but you're really quite young, is that it?
So when someone says, "Hey, you look good for your age," you have no idea what they're talking about, because I certainly don't.
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, son.
I think his eyebrows put too much pressure on the frontal lobe.
All right, let's get everything straight.
Uh, Mom's a cute little Boulder gal who obviously prefers men from another planet, and, uh, Dad's a space jockey, and, well, now you're all famous, and there's talk of a TV talk show and you'll probably be put against old Tom here, huh?
Ha, ha.
Oh.
Oh.
Not a bad idea, hey?
You know something?
You look exactly like our garbage man.
Uh, Tom, you see, one of the reasons we're considering a television show is we feel that it's the most effective way to reach a large number of people.
See, Mork hopes to promote a cultural exchange of, um, understanding and respect between our two worlds.
- Right, Mork?
- Very much so.
That and being on Battle of the Network Stars.
Excuse me, I'm getting a cue here from my stage manager over there, and, uh, well, McConnells, you've been really interesting guests and I'd like to talk to you more about the, uh, mysteries of the universe, but I got a man in the green room who makes cities out of toothpicks and he's putting the finishing touches there on Fort Lauderdale.
So McConnells, uh, good night and, uh, na-na, nu-nu, or whatever the heck it is you say.
It doesn't matter, Tom.
Any way you want to fly.
We'll be back in two minutes, five seconds after we hear from our affiliates across this country coast to coast.
That's it?
What a gyp.
You had Charles Manson on for a whole hour.
Son, son.
Mind, Mind, pull harder.
I can grow another one.
Why don't they just go upstairs and bother Warren Beatty?
Mearth?
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, Mommy and Daddy.
- We made it.
I was just talking to the press here.
That is off the record, isn't it?
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the snacks.
Hello.
Goodbye.
- Mork?
- Mind?
- We gotta stay calm, okay?
- Mm-hm.
I know you feel like you're being pulled in a million different directions.
Yeah, you're not kidding, Mind.
I feel like a fire hose in the South Bronx.
Unhand me, Mr. Lawman.
Don't you know who I am?
Why, I'm Mork's producer.
I'm who got Arthur Miller to write that episode on CHiPs.
Mork.
There he is, the new media's darling of the day and his little pooter.
- Hi, Billy.
- Let's talk TV, kids.
I think Mork's had enough for today.
I was so looking forward to talking concept and sipping white wine.
You know what?
Why don't I introduce you to your writers?
- Oh, yes.
- They're absolutely hilarious.
And you know why?
Because not one of them had a date in high school.
Oh, are you the guys who wrote "But seriously"?
I love that.
And also, "Hey, where are you from"?
What?
Who?
Mommy, Daddy, do we know a Ron and Nancy?
- No, sweetheart, just take a message.
- We'll call you back.
I don't care what color your house is.
Mork, here is the concept.
You are going to be starring in Those Amazing Aliens.
Now, on the first episode, we're gonna strap you to the nose of a Concorde and when you land in Paris, we set you on fire and make you eat mud.
Isn't that wonderful?
I get to go to Paris.
No.
Absolutely not.
Very well, Miss Red Blazer.
He can read a poem at the end of the show.
See if I care.
The T-shirts were just the tip of the merchandising iceberg.
I don't care if you are my granddaddy.
Mommy said to tell everybody that they're not in.
Mearth.
Dad Now, listen, Mork, tomorrow we're going to make you look like an alien.
- But I am.
- We're gonna shave your head - No, no - We're gonna tint your skin green I knew you'd be here.
Oh, Mind I couldn't take the pressure.
All those people hounding me, Mind.
How does Slappy White do it?
Oh, Mork, Kalnik gave us no choice.
But all the notoriety hasn't changed us.
No.
Where's Mearth?
Well, he's getting a star on Hollywood Boulevard today.
Don't worry, he's with Dad.
Well, Mind, what's up for us next?
Are we gonna end up like every other American flash-in-the-pan?
Making spaghetti westerns in Italy?
Oh, Mork, I wish I could tell you all this was gonna change tomorrow, but I can't.
You're about as cheerful as an East Berlin cheerleader.
Ha, ha.
I'm not finished yet.
Sit down.
On what's left of our couch.
Mork, what we've gotta do starting right now is take control of our lives.
Well, I know what I want right now.
What?
Nobody can make us do anything we don't wanna do.
Unless they've got a great big outer space ray gun.
Ooh.
All right, you've got 30 seconds to live.
- Twenty-nine, 28 - Wait a minute.
You call that a second?
It should be 27 Mississippi, Twenty-five Mississippi, Stop it!
You're crazy.
You need help.
And so do you.
What do you expect to accomplish by killing us?
Your death.
You spoiled my plot.
You turned me into a statue and you made me miss my parents' 400th anniversary.
Four hundred years?
Oh, that's terrific.
Mazel tov.
Thank you.
They're wonderful and still very alert.
Oh, really?
Don't we deserve to see our first year anniversary?
Not the way you cook.
I saw you on Merv the other night.
I tried your Chicken Kiev recipe.
You used too much garlic.
You made me ruin my dinner party and you're gonna pay for it.
Wait.
I have one last request.
I would like to die with dignity, with honor and with my penny loafers on.
All right, hurry up.
Hurry up.
The guys are waiting for me down in the car.
I have a 2:00 tee-off.
- Do you need a couple of caddies?
- Nine Mississippi All right, all right.
Don't rush.
It's not an easy thing to prepare for.
Hold it.
Sissy shoes.
Do you realize what I paid for these?
Oh, Mork.
Oh, will you look at that?
Kal, you don't have to kill me.
I'm gonna die of embarrassment.
- Put on the shoes - I'm trying This one?
That was "let's go".
- All right.
Well, well, well - All right.
Well, you've been a lovely couple but it's time to play "You Lose Your Life".
Thank you.
It's nice seeing you too, because there's no place like Rome.
There's no place like Rome.
There's no place like Rome.
There's no place like Rome.
Come back here.
Come back here.
Mork.
Mindy.
What do you gotta do to kill somebody around here?
"Time travel shoes.
Ruby red.
Size eight".
Ugh.
I fell for the oldest time travel trick in the books.
Sorry, guys, I can't play golf today.
I gotta go kill Mork and Mindy.
You did it.
We escaped through time.
- Where do you think we are?
- I don't know.
- Get us out of here.
- Here we go.
- Hurry.
- Home, James.
- Home, James.
Uh-oh.
- Mork.
Something's wrong.
Maybe the insole's short circuited.
Well, I hope I have the receipt.
Do you realize where we are?
We're at the dawn of man.
Oh, no, Mind.
Finally we'll be able to buy land in California cheap.
Oh, no.
Get ready for a fight.
Well, I see evolution hasn't changed you.
I'll soothe the savage beasts.
Look.
Yes.
Look nice.
Nice.
The record company executives did the same thing.
Rahlu.
Rahlu.
Rahlu.
Oh, she must think you did magic.
Well, either that or she's near-sighted and has a foot fetish.
I knew I should have paid more attention in eighth period history.
I'm trying to remember anything good that ever happened in a cave.
Rahlu.
Rahlu.
Mind, if we play charades tonight, I want her on my team.
Macho.
Talk about your Old Spice, Mind.
Maybe you just need partial protection.
- No.
- Mind, they're your ancestors.
You talk to them.
- Don't be afraid.
- Uh Me, ugh, Mindy.
Shiksa likes mayonnaise and Tupperware.
- Him, Mork.
Mindy, Mork.
- Na-no.
We friends of yours.
We come here from, uh, Boulder, Colorado.
Many moons from here.
Ah-ah-ah.
Don't worry about them, Mind.
I think I have mastered their language.
Watch my lips.
Look.
Ooh.
Listen.
Rahlu.
Rahlu.
They're in key, Mind.
They're in key.
Rahlu.
Rahlu Rahlu.
Rahlu.
Rahlu, Rahlu Sometimes you ra-win Sometimes you ra-lose Now we have the Rahlu Blues.
Ha, ha!
Oh, uh Oh, no, uh, my doctor told me I should cut down on raw zebra.
Oh, no thanks.
I really don't like mastodon tartar.
I'll stick to bark.
I need the roughage.
- No.
- No.
Not today.
Mork, will you just keep working on that shoe?
- Yeah, Mind.
- I am freezing.
I want to go home to our family and a warm bed.
Oh, yeah, and plumbing.
Oh, and clean clothes.
And Frank Gifford.
What?
We're freezing to death and you miss Frank Gifford?
Don't you?
If you're freezing to death, why don't we go over and pile on?
I mean, that big guy over there would make a great pillow.
Look at them over there, all heaped together like that.
I feel so sorry for them.
Yeah, they look like a dessert cart at a cannibal restaurant.
Look how hard they have to fight to survive.
Against animals and enemies and this brutal climate.
I mean, all this tribe has are a couple of crummy weapons, and they don't even have a fire.
Help me gather some twigs.
Hey, Mind, what're you doing?
You don't have to clean up here.
I mean, you're not gonna invent maid service, are you?
I'm not cleaning up.
I'm gonna make a fire.
Think about what you're doing.
You could be altering history.
I mean, then the Wright Brothers could be wrong.
The Righteous Brothers might end up being atheists.
What?
Mork, all I know is the discovery of fire predates cave paintings by thousands of years.
So that means somehow this tribe lost that knowledge.
- All I'm doing is giving it back to them.
- Well Wouldn't you want someone to do it for your son?
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.
Help me with the fire.
I'm gonna do it.
Keep blowing.
I'm gonna give these people a better future.
Keep going.
It's starting to work.
Keep blowing.
Keep blowing.
Oh, you inventors are so temperamental, Mind.
It's starting to smolder.
I can't believe it.
I saw this on Grizzly Adams, but I didn't think it was gonna work.
Do you realize what's happening here?
I'm gonna give this tribe a new lease on life.
Can you bring that light over here?
Pardon me.
How's this, hon?
Oh, that's much better.
Mind, guess who's already invented fire?
I am so embarrassed.
Aw.
It was a lovely gesture.
Don't you Oh, little pooter, come on now.
Mind, I guess we'll just have to invent the Olympics now.
Sprint.
All right, so they had fire.
But I want to leave these people with something.
I'm gonna teach them how to protect themselves or how to plant seeds.
I know, the wheel.
That's a good one.
Unless they've already invented it.
You wanna teach them something?
Teach them how to invent pantyhose.
Very funny.
Mork, think about how often you're allowed to leave your mark on history.
Good morning, campers.
I have such a lovely day planned for us.
First, I'm gonna vaporize you.
Then, the rest of us go canoeing.
Hello.
Kalnik.
And you said I had sissy shoes.
Stall him, Mind.
Maybe I can get these babies working Uh, so Kalnik, how'd you find us out here in the boonies?
It wasn't easy following you through time.
I had tickets to the theater.
I ended up sitting between Booth and Lincoln.
But that's history, and now so are you.
Oops.
Here goes nothing.
Does anybody have any aspirin?
- Oh, Mork, I'm scared.
- Oh, don't be, Mind.
Just hold on.
I don't know what's in store for us, but whatever happens, we'll have each other.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Na-no, na-no.
Mom.
- Mom.
- You're from Neptune?
My name is Kalnik, but please call me Kal.
You live on Earth?
Me too.
No one calls my son a mutant.
Take a hike.
You'll live to regret this, Orkan.
Take your hands off Ah!
- You're an android.
- And I am also a bomb.
A bomb!
Hide!
I have a feeling we're never gonna see this place again.
Why do you want to kill us?
Because you're the only ones that can throw a monkey wrench into my plans.
Nothing is gonna stop Kalnik's men.
They think you're the alien who's out to take over the world and they're gonna keep hunting until they find you.
There's only one choice, but I think it's the only way.
I have to tell the world I'm an alien.
That way they know I've got nothing to hide.
That's the only way.
I've gotta go public.
Mork is the most famous man in the world, and I'm offering you your own prime time television show.
What?
Oh, Mind, this is so fast.
Four days ago I was having dinner with a lady friend of mine at my favorite Italian restaurant.
I won't give it a plug, but you know which one.
The one where the Pope eats when he's in town, so you know it's good.
Anyway, in the bar the TV's blasting away about, uh, some alien from another planet.
Well, I'm not buying it at first, but for gosh darn it, uh, I turn out to be wrong.
Anyway, he's here with us tonight.
He truly is a spaceman from another planet and he's here to tell us about it with his wife.
Will you please welcome to the stage Mr. Mork and Mindy McConnell?
Oh.
Oh.
Hi, Tom.
Ha, ha.
You know, back on my planet, the green room is flesh colored.
- So you're the guy from Ork.
- Yep.
Sometimes I get the feeling that half of my staff here is from Ork.
Ha-ha-ha.
I really don't think so, Tom.
Reading from the papers, uh, we know that apparently you are an alien, but you married him, why?
Two billion guys on this planet, they're not all good lookers, but you couldn't find one that you liked, for God's sakes?
No, um, it's not like that at all.
It's just that Mork is very special and loving and he doesn't know the meaning of the word "deceit".
Remarkable, remarkable.
Now I understand that you have a son and his name is Steve?
- Mearth.
- Mearth.
Good work, research.
Well, I think that's an excellent time to bring out young Mearth.
Uh, will you please welcome to the stage Mr. Mearth McConnell?
Mork, you're gonna have yourself a six-footer here.
Ha-ha-ha.
Hello, Tom.
Are you ready for this, Mr. Tom?
It's super neat.
Tell me about the stars and Uh, so, big fella, you age backwards, is that it?
You're really old but you're really quite young, is that it?
So when someone says, "Hey, you look good for your age," you have no idea what they're talking about, because I certainly don't.
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, son.
I think his eyebrows put too much pressure on the frontal lobe.
All right, let's get everything straight.
Uh, Mom's a cute little Boulder gal who obviously prefers men from another planet, and, uh, Dad's a space jockey, and, well, now you're all famous, and there's talk of a TV talk show and you'll probably be put against old Tom here, huh?

Excuse me, I'm getting a cue here from my stage manager over there, and, uh, well, McConnells, you've been really interesting guests and I'd like to talk to you more about the, uh, mysteries of the universe, but I got a man in the green room who makes cities out of toothpicks and he's putting the finishing touches there on Fort Lauderdale.
So McConnells, uh, good night and, uh, na-na, nu-nu, or whatever the heck it is you say.
It doesn't matter, Tom.
Any way you want to fly.
We'll be back in two minutes, five seconds after we hear from our affiliates across this country coast to coast.
That's it?
What a gyp.
You had Charles Manson on for a whole hour.
Son, son.
Mind, Mind, pull harder.
I can grow another one.
Why don't they just go upstairs and bother Warren Beatty?
Mearth?
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, Mommy and Daddy.

That is off the record, isn't it?
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the snacks.
Hello.
Goodbye.
- Mork?
- Mind?
- We gotta stay calm, okay?
- Mm-hm.
I know you feel like you're being pulled in a million different directions.
Yeah, you're not kidding, Mind.
I feel like a fire hose in the South Bronx.
Unhand me, Mr. Lawman.
Don't you know who I am?
Why, I'm Mork's producer.
I'm who got Arthur Miller to write that episode on CHiPs.
