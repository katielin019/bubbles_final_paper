I'm hoping to.
Tell me something?
Yeah.
That awful girl at the party last night?
Yeah.
The one who kept giggling and trying to do a strip tease?
Yeah.
That was me, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Eleanor must hate me.
It was her wedding reception and i ruined it.
She didn't even notice.
Her labor pains started and they rushed her off to the hospital.
Last night?
Yeah, she had a boy.
Seven pounds, eight ounces.
Oh, wonderful.
I sure hope that baby doesn't keep them awake at night on their honeymoon.
Look at that.
I'd rather take a bath.
It's all your fault, you know, you made the punch.
There was nothing wrong with the punch.
Ohthen why did the ladle turn green?
I never made punch before.
Maybe there was something wrong with the gin.
Or the tequila, or the whisky, or the rum, or the vodka, or the- there's a man in there.
A what?
A ma-a man, a guy, asleep in the bathtub.
See?
Is he a friend of yours?
Er.
No, no.
I-I never saw him before.
Maybe he's a burglar.
Oh, sure, he came in to steal the bathtub and fell asleep on the job.
We just can't leave him in there, i mean, there's a girl coming to look at Eleanor's room.
Oh, that's no problem.
We'll just keep her out of the bathroom.
What if she has to use the bathroom?
That could be a problem.
Wait.
Uh, good evening.
Good morning.
Good lord, is it morning?
Yes, yes it is.
And-and if you don't mind a stupid question, who are you?
Uh, oh, i'm sorry, i'm Jack-Jack Tripper.
That water's wet.
Uh, you don't happen to have a towel handy?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I'm Chrissy.
Hi.
And this is Janet.
Oh, yeah.
I remember you.
You were at the party last night.
We gave the party last night.
Well, i was one of your guests.
I came with a friend who knew one of the gate crashers.
Why were you sleeping in the bathtub?
Huh, I-I don't know.
L-last thing I remember I had a glass of that terrible punch and then everything went black.
And green.
Isn't there, uh, another girl who lives with you?
The one who's you know?
Eleanor, yeah, she had a boy.
Yeah, she must have.
Well, look, i'm-i'm sorry.
I better be going.
Good.
Hey, you can't go out like that.
Take your clothes off first.
Hum?
That party upstairs kept me awake till three o'clock in the morning.
Oh, really?
I didn't think you could hear it over your snoring.
I wouldn't have minded if i'd been invited.
Oh, you wouldn't have liked it, Stanley.
All those young girls.
You're not up to it.
What does that mean?
It's all you can do to keep the pot boiling down here.
Well, those girls better watch it or out they go.
Look at that crack in the ceiling.
Their party did that.
Oh, that wasn't the party, Stanley, that was the earthquake.
What earthquake?
The big one, don't you remember?
Oh, it was thrilling.
Thrilling?
Yeah, it was the first time our bed moved in years.
Will you get your mind out of the bed and onto the ceiling?
This is my building.
They should get my permission before they throw parties like that.
Oh, come on, Stanley, it was just a little party.
A going away party for one of the girls.
If you'd go away, i'd give a party.
You know, it's a shame you don't live in india, you'd be sacred there.
And contented.
All right, which one of us is going to go up and complain?
Well, i think it should be the head of the house.
Right.
I'll go as soon as my nails are dry.
Pants, socks, shorts- anything else?
Only things that don't come off.
Here, you can put this on.
Me, wear this?
You've got to be kidding?
Eleanor didn't like it either, that's why she left it behind.
Yeah, but- it's the only thing we have that'll fit you.
Don't say anything.
What do you think?
I can't tell.
I'm used to seeing it pregnant.
If the guys at the gym could see me now they'd make me turn in my towel you want to put these in the oven?
Sure.
The oven?
Can you think of a better way to dry them?
Uh, not too well done, huh?
Uh, you don't happen to have a razor do you?
Yeah, you can borrow mine.
Great.
There you go.
I have a very light beard.
Uh, is there any shaving cream?
No.
It's going to be painful.
Wait.
Try this.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, this will be fine.
What is it?
We use it to clean the sink.
Oh, boy, you really loused up that toast.
It's not my fault, Eleanor didn't leave the recipe are the scrambled eggs ready yet?
Yeah, for the garbage pail.
What's cooking?
Breakfast.
You're just in time.
Oh, do you mind if i eat in my boots?
I'd rather you ate off the table.
It started out as scrambled eggs.
Really?
Yes.
Well, i'm-i'm sure it's delicious.
I, uh, this-this-is horrible.
oh.
Do you think you could do any better?
The proof will be in the eating.
Let me see what you've got in here.
Okay.
Eggs, butter, sliced mushrooms- an onion- we'll start with that.
Start what?
Eggs madera fun chow, can you boil an egg?
I don't know, Eleanor always did the cooking.
Are you sure that you know what you're doing?
Oh, yes.
I'm studying to be a chef at the L.A. Technical College.
You are leaping at the galloping gourmet of 1980.
Oh, it takes that long?
You have to learn how to trot before you can gallop.
Who said that?
Now, for my special touch i'll need some bread crumbs i think i have some in my bed.
Never mind.
I'll-i'll make my own.
Well, that's silly, nobody makes bread crumbs, they just sort of fall off the bread.
Uh, wine, i need some wine.
Do you have a bottle?
No.
Ooh, but i can make one up from the party leftovers.
Good.
Oh, um, does it have to be all one color?
Um-hum.
Could you get me a heaping tablespoon of milk?
Yeah.
Heaping?
Never mind, that's fine.
Who is it?
It's mrs.
Roper.
Oh, come in.
Hey, don't you lock your door?
Whenever i think of it.
Oh, you shouldn't take any chances.
You know, there's been a lot of robberies in this neighborhood lately.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, look honey, about all that noise you were making last night.
Oh, yeah, um, mrs.
Roper, i am really sorry.
I was going to come down.
Yeah right through the ceiling we thought.
i didn't mind all the music but, uh, ooh, all that foul language.
There wasn't any foul language.
You weren't down there with mr.
Roper.
Well, we weren't the only ones making noise.
He was beating on the ceiling with a broom handle.
I know, now, just keep it down next time, okay?
Okay.
You know what mr.
Roper's like.
"I don't want any weirdo's or hanky panky in my house".
He thinks-he thinks Queen Victoria was a swinger.
Where's my wine oh, hi.
Hello.
Here it is and hurry up, i'm really starving.
What's that?
Oh, a girlfriend spent the night here last night.
Girlfriendlook, look- she looks dreadful without makeup, doesn't she?
Now, will you go down there and tell mr.
Roper that i promise we are going to be quiet from now on.
Do you study cooking full-time?
Weekdays from eight till two, the rest of the time i pick up odd jobs.
How 'bout you, what do you do?
I work in a pool?
You're a lifeguard?
She means a typing pool.
You're a typist?
With a shape like that?
Oh, it doesn't get in the way.
No, what i meant was that you're great looking oh, thank you.
And to keep all that hidden.
I think your onions are overheating.
Janet works in a flower shop, isn't that exciting?
Terrific.
I'll get it.
As far as i'm concerned, she's already got it.
Hi.
Patricia Crawford.
No, i'm Chrissy Snow.
No, i mean i'm Patricia Crawford, i've come to look at your apartment.
Oh, yeah, we're expecting you.
You can use the bathroom now.
Must i?
A man up there?
In women's clothes?
That's right, Stanley.
He was wearing a girl's dressing gown, but he didn't fool me are you sure it was a man, not a woman?
They all look alike nowadays.
Not to me they don't.
Besides, i could see some little hairs on his chest, peeping out.
Well, that doesn't prove anything, look at your mother.
Look, i don't care whether you believe me or not, but it was a man.
I wonder what game is going on up there?
Oh, probably something delightfully kinky that only three can play.
I'm going up there and i'm going to bounce him right out on his ear.
Well, it is small of course, but then most of the time i'll be out here with you gals chin-wagging.
Uh, yes, this is the kitchen where we chin our wags.
And this is Jack Tripper.
Hi.
How do you do?
We found him in the bathtub.
Really?
I found a spider in the bath once.
You know, they crawl up the drain pipe, oh, it was a horrible, hairy little thing.
I just opened my mouth and screamed.
I've kept the plug in it ever since.
She could've fooled me.
Well, um, uh-look, Patricia?
My friends call me "pattikins".
Okay, Patricia, the thing is- well, we have a lot of other girls coming to look at the apartment.
We have?
Well, we better have.
Well, i could always come back tomorrow.
All right, where is he?
Mr. Roper?
There you are.
You know, those clothes don't fool me a bit.
This is our landlord.
How do you do?
I was just telling the girls what attractive- Take off those clothes.
I beg your pardon?
I beg your pardon?
Don't even sound like a girl.
Who do you think your fooling?
I mean, anybody can see that those aren't real.
What made you think that you could- oh, my god.
You dirty old man.
I'm sorry.
It's a mistake anybody could make.
I mean they don't look real well, l-l-l-i mean they look like a pair of, like-like a couple of, uh-oh, oh.
He touched my bosoms.
Do you think he's taking too much Geritol?
I couldn't, i just-i just couldn't live in the same house with a man, i couldn't - he didn't even say, "please" come and get it.
You sit here, Chrissy.
Oh, how nice.
Oh, you sit there.
I hope it's all right.
It's the best i could do under these primitive conditions.
Mm, mm?
Mm, mm, mm you don't care for it, huh?
Oh, oh, it's nothing really any genius could have done it.
My specialty is- what's that?
French eventually, uh, i'm hopin to open up a little restaurant for people who can really appreciate high prices.
This breakfast is good enough to eat.
Thank you, i enjoyed making it.
I don't get a chance to practice much at the ymca.
Is that where you're staying?
I can't afford any place else unless i can find someone to share an apartment with.
Are you thinking what i'm thinking?
I think so.
Good.
Listen, Jack, how would you like- i like it already.
But first let's just talk it over.
Would you excuse us for a minute?
And what's there to talk over, Janet?
I mean, i think he'd make a terrific roommate.
Oh, so do i. Okay, let's ask him.
No, no, no.
Before we rush into this i think that we should add up the pluses and the minuses.
All right.
Okay, he is a great cook.
Plus.
He would be good protection for us around the house.
Plus.
He's very good looking.
Minus/pulse Minus?
Minus.
You saw the way he was looking at you in there.
I know you Chrissy, you have a very low melting point.
That's true.
I mean, just a little bit of sweet talk and you fall apart.
Look what happened with Frank.
I know, but Frank seemed so nice.
He said he wanted me for a friend.
Yeah, and then the next night he bought the friend.
You're right.
But with Jack, i'll be strong.
No, no, no, no, no- it will not work.
You can't help yourself, Chrissy.
So i'm afraid you know what the answer's got to be yeah, you'll have to be strong enough for both of us.
Eat your din-din.
I'm telling you, Helen, it was a woman.
I have a very sensitive finger.
Oh, Stanley, i know a man when i see one.
Mainly from memory of course.
What does that mean?
It's been a long time since you laid your finger on me.
You know something, Helen?
You've got enough mouth for three lips.
I don't care what you say Stanley, it's a him.
It's a her.
It's a him.
I was up there.
I know what i saw.
Well, i was up there and l- it was a her.
Me move in here with you two?
Um-hum.
Are you serious?
Yes, of course you'll have to share everything.
Gladly.
The rent, the food, the phone bill.
Oh, those, yeah, sure.
Right, well, what do you say?
I need time to think it over.
I'll take it.
First, let's just get one little thing straight.
That is your room and this is our room.
One false move and we take you right to the vet.
You can move in as soon as you like.
Hi.
Sorry to barge in on you again like this, but me and the wife are having a little disagreement about a certain matter of, uh, sex.
You want to borrow a book?
No, i don't want to borrow a book.
No, it's about him.
Himno, he's not the one no, no, no.
No definitely not.
Definitely not.
Uh, this is our landlord.
He's always doing that.
Hi.
Tripper, Jack Tripper.
I'm moving in here.
No, the one i saw was completely-oh, no you're not i'm not?
Are you crazy?
Moving in with two girls?
Not in my building you're not.
Well, wait a minute, it'll be strictly platonic.
Well, i don't care what it is.
What does that mean?
Like you and me, Stanley.
Even so, you can't move in here.
Yeah, well, i guess i'll put my pants on.
If you must you must.
See what i mean, why'd he have them off in the first place?
They probably clashed with his dressing gown.
I'm sorry, Jack.
Yeah, so am i. That landlord of yours, he's really the pits.
Ah, ha, hot-hot.
I shouldn't have let him push me around, you know, i should've laid right into him well, you still can.
You won't mind?
No, i'd enjoy it.
You would?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Okay.
Mr. Roper, l-i have something i want to tell you, i wouldn't live under your roof for all the tea- it's all right.
It's all right.
Son, Janet just explained it to us, i'm sorry i misjudged you oh?
You can move in, it's all right.
Oh.
And we hope you'll be very happy here, dear.
Oh.
Ta-ta.
How did you get him to change his mind?
Easy.
I just convinced him that nothing would happen between Jack and us.
How did you do that?
Well, i told him that Jack was a decent, respectable, hard-working young man.
And that did it?
Not quite-i also told him that you were gay.
Three's company was videotaped in front of a studio audience.

Well, i did my bit- i put the toilet seat up.
I just want to make his room more attractive.
Ugh!
I always say it's little homey touches that make a home homier.
Chrissy, the man is coming from the ymca.
If we stick him in a broom closet he will feel at home.
I still think that-why are yo u watering the table?
Oh, oh, i could have sworn that- oh, i put the plant in jack's room.
It'll brighten things up for him.
Oh, well, let's don't brighten things up too much.

T. You're right, i'll watch i so will jack.
What are you doing just stamping out jack's name for the mailbox.

He knows everything.

The weatherman said there'd be thunderstorms tonight.
Oh, mr.
Roper, our smiling landlord.
L. I'm here to f ix your doorbel and mrs.

I wasn't nappin g in my arm chair.
I was watching televis ion with my eyes closed.
When i want to sle ep, i go to bed.
And when he goes to bed, he wants to sleep.
T?
What's wrong with tha oh, fix the doorbell, stanley.
It's time somebody's chime s were rung in this house.
You know, it's too bad your fairy roommate ain't checked in yet.
Why?
He could fix this without a ladder-just fly up here stanley was born with that sense of humor, that and a few other birth defects.
Here's your problem right here.
Se.
See these wires?
They're loo isn't that brilliant?
How'd they get loose?
Maybe it's like shoe laces, if you don't tie the bows tight- wires don't get loose all by themselves, you know.
Stanley be careful, they're live.
Ng.
I know what i'm doi s. I just want to g et to the bottom of thi you've been playing aroun d with these wires?
Girls got to have some fun.
All right, captain queeg, you got your confession-now make the bell go "ding-dong".
Thanks for helping me with my stuff from the cab.

You don't hav e to take them insi i wasn't going to.
Ns look, i'm sorry a bout that jar of pickled onio n, i broke in your cab, but i f you keep all the windows ope the smell should b e gone in about- a month.
Yeah, with any luck.
That's $2.75.
Oh, yeah, i got it right here interesting doorbell.
Aah, ow, ow, ow i didn't hear nothing, i didn't see nothing, and i don't know nothing.
Oh, oh.
What happened?
He's trying to tell you someone's ringing the doorbell.
Hi, jack, come on in.
Hi.
Couldn't you knock?
I better get him to bed while he's still moving.
I don't want to go to bed, want to watch "name that tune".
That's his favorite program ever since he guessed the "star spangled banner" in seven notes.
What about the doorbell?
I'll fix it later, unless the interior decorator here would like to do it?
I'm not an interior decorator.
No i thought all you f-fellows were.
What fellas?
You know, tinkerbells?
Oh, i see what you mean.
No actually, not all of us are interior decorators, some of us are boxers.
No kidding?
No kidding.
You mean you'd actually hit another guy?
Oh, only if he made fun of us.
We'll get your bags in.
No, wait, you don't have to do that.
Well it's only fair.
If it were my bags, you would have to carry them.
That almost makes sense, doesn't it?
We hope you'll be very happy here, dear.
Well it beats the ymca.
Oh, yes, nothing but men, isn't it?
I can imagine what it must be like.

Mr. Roper doesn't believe in charity.
Speaking of roper, how long do i have to go on letting him think i'm gay oh, as long as you live here.

Suppose her mother sees me?
I'll do it.
Turn around.
That's a lovely mole you've got on your thigh.
Watch him.
He's tricky.
Boy, in that nightie she's really something.

You're very bright.
Ah, more like a chimp.
No, janet, i think you're very cute.

You've heard of jet lag, haven't you?
Heard of it?
I married it.
She's trying to adjust to a new time zone.
She's trying to adjust to living the life of a nun.
What's that supposed to mean?
You never let her out of your sight.
You're more like her jailer than her uncle.
That's ridiculous.
She's having a good time.
She's having a boring time.
Boringhow can you say that?
Didn't i take her to disneyland didn't i take her to the museum didn't i walk out to the en d of the pier with her?
Didn't i tell her every night about my experiences in the war?
You call that boring, huh?
Helen?

Oh, sorry stanley, i must've drifted off.
Look, i promised my brother that i'd take good care of her and that's just what i'm doing oh, well, she ought to be out having some fun with people her own age.
She ought to be out dating.
Dating?
In this city?
It's crawling with freaks and- and weirdos and-and perverts.
Oh, i wasn't talking about your friends stanley.
I just hope you don't make a crack like that in front of karen, you'll give her the wrong idea of her uncle.
Oh, i think she has the right idea of you.
I hope so.
Oh!
Whatwhat?
Why don't you let her meet the kids upstairs?
You mean the andrews sisters?
Andrews sisters?
Yeah, patty, maxine, and tinkerbell.
Oh, of course, you're right, stanley.
Oh, i forgot.
She'd never be interested in a fella like jack.
You mean he would never be interested in any girl.
I don't understand people like jack.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
For once in your life, you got a smart idea.
We should put this date down on the calendar.
When she gets up and gets dressed, i'm going to go talk to jac k about taking her out.
I mean dating him is as safe as sending her out in an armored truck.
E. Hey, i got janet 's birthday cak oh, good.
Where's the birthday girl oh, she's in the kitchen keepin an eye on your birthday dinner.
And who's keeping an eye on her oh, you shouldn't sneak up like that.
And you shouldn't turn around like that when i'm sneaking up like that.
I was going to give you a big surprise birthday kiss.
Well, why did you have to sneak up?
What do you want me to do?
Phone for an appointment?
No.
Okay, you can kiss me now.
No, the moment's ruined.
Maybe i'll go and sneak u p and surprise chrissy.
It's not her birthday till january.

Jack.
I want my birthday kiss.
All right.
Surprise.
Happy birthday no, you.
T. Righ happy birthday.

Oh, oh, gee, we're stuck, wa oh, well, there's no sens in wasting all this closeness.
Well, let's just save tha t for next year.
Just get my chain unstuck i got it.
Al.
Oh, be careful, it's very speci why?
My grandmother gave it to me.
It used to have a beautiful cameo hanging from it.
Oh, did you lose it?
No, i hocked it.
It was about three months ago, we needed rent money.
Uh, jack, could i see you for a minute?
Re.
Su sorry, kid, you had your chance.
"Happy birthday jimmy"?
Who is jimmy?
I don't know.
Some guy who didn't pick up his cake.
That-that's why i got it at half-price.
You can't give janet a jimm y cake, she might notice.
Chrissy, it's easily fixed.
All i have to do is scrape off the "immy," so it reads happy birthday "j," which is even better, has that informal touch.
Where you going?
Into the kitchen to fix the cake.
But what about janet?
I like her the way she is, i'll just fix the cake.
What i mean is what if she sees it?
It'll spoil the whole surprise.
Chrissy, she knows it's her birthday.
She knows i'm cooking a special dinner to celebrate.
She even told me where to buy the cake.
Well, that's what i mean.
One more hint and she's going to know for sure.
Okay, i'll do it later.
What did you get janet for her birthday?
Oh, i got her a terrific scarf.
Oh, that's nice.
Well, it's not only pretty, it's practical.
It goes with all my outfits too.
I wish i could raise some money to get janet a present.
Oh, you're cooking dinner , that's enough.
Hi.
E?
Uh, would you excuse us, pleas do you want to be alone?
No, i want to talk to jack.
It'll just be a minute.
Okay.
Do you want to sit down?
Do you, uh, enjoy being here?
U?
You mean with yo t?
No, l-i mean in this apartmen yeah, it's fine.
That-that's good.
You don't mind if i'm a little nosy, do you?
Well, we're getting used to it.
I was just wondering.
Did you ever take out a girl before?
Before what?
I mean it's not against the rules for you fellas, is it?
Rules?
I mean because, well, like, i go out with other guys.
You do no, you know what i mean.
I go bowling or go to a ball game.
Oh, well, i could do that with a girl, i guess.
That's terrific.
Because i wouldn't want you to do anything that would go against your religion.
I'm not sure i'm following you well, see, we have this niece visiting us and mrs.
Roper and i were just wondering if- if it would be all right if she went out with you tonight?
Oh, you want me to go out with your niece?
Yeah, but you don't have to go anywhere where you might bump into some of your friends.
Oh, well, thank you.
Well, you could take her dancing.
Dancing?
Yeah, the way the kids dance nowadays, you don't even have to touch her.
Mr. Roper, i'd be happy to take out your niece.
Wonderful.
But i can't.
Today is janet's birthday and i don't want to miss that.
We got a cake.
We're planning dinner and everything.
Oh, well- sorry.
Could you put off the birthday until tomorrow?
I'm sorry, but th anks for asking d. I'm very flattere yeah, i knew you would be.
Of course, of course, i wouldn't want you to do anything against your religion.
Oh, you heard?
Well, of course we did.
We were eavesdropping.
I think it is very noble of you to turn him down on my account.
Well, it wasn't quite as noble as you think.
Why not?
Suddenly i got a vision of what roper's niece would look like.
Oh, yeah, imagine roper's face on a girl.
Imagine roper's body on a girl.
Well, i still think it was really nice of you to stay for my birthday.
Hey, i wouldn't miss your birthday for anything.
What do you think i am?
Some kind of a fink?
Ahem, jack, uh, don't you have something to do?
Hum?
Like pick up the wine for the you know what?
You mean the wine for my surprise birthday party?
Oh, you guessed.
The surprise is, it's going to be beer.
In.
Hi aga mr.
Roper, i thought i told you- oh, i thought that you might want to meet my niece anyway.
Uh, karen?
Want to come in and say hello to jack.
Hi.
Whatoh, hi, hi.
And this is chrissy and janet.
Hi.
Hello.
Jack?
Hi.
Can i talk with you?
Oh, sure.
Excuse me, uh, your uncle wants to talk to me for a minute, i'll be right back.
Here.
What's this fifty bucks.
For me i know it goes against your grain, but you've got to do me a favor and take her out.
Fifty bucks?
Yeah, i'll lend you my car.
I mean, anything to get mrs.
Roper off my back.
Will you do it?
S. Oh, ye uncle stanley and aunt helen have been very nice, only i think my uncle must have had an accident or something.
Oh?
Yeah.
He can't seem to remember anything that's happened since the war.
Karen?
I think jack here wants to ask you something.
Oh, he can ask me anything.
Uh, yeah, uh, karen, how would you like me to show you the town tonight?
Oh, i'd love it.
Okay, let's go.
See ya.
Wait a minute.
What about the party?
Just take the dinner out of the stove in 20 minutes.
Well-?
I'll be back in time for the party, bye-bye.
Bye.
Don't be late.
And jack's really a nice person nice fink.
Cheers cheers.
That wasn't a nice thing to do to jack's hat.
You're right.
I should've waited till his head was in it.
I don't understand, he said he'd be back in time.
Something must've happened to him.
Someonehappened to him.
Someone with big blue eyes and boo- okay, okay.
You know, chrissy, there was something about that karen that i didn't like.
She's a very beautiful girl that was it.
Do you think jack noticed?
Noticed?
Uh, he notices anything female.
I think his head is built on a swivel.
You know wha t the trouble is hum?
We're jealous.
Uh-je-jealous?
Of jack?
I'm not jealous.
I'm mad- mad that he sto od us up on my birthday.
Now, we don't own him janet remember, he's just a third of the rent.
Yeah.
Ok.
And a great co yeah.
And a watchdog well, then he should be here watching me blow out my candles.
Chrissy, do you dig him?
He's okay.
No.
No, i mean, if he wasn't living here, would you- would i what?
You know.
Jack?
Yeah.
U?
Would yo i asked you first.
Would you?
Pe.
No oh.
Not unless he asked me to.
Well, you know me janet.
I just hate to be rude.
You're right anyway, we don't own him.
E he's got his own life to lead and let's just cut that cak and let's hope his leg heals very quickly.
His leg?
Yeah, the one i'm going to break.
Stanley, will you stop that pacing and come to bed?
I'm not sleepy.
That's the best time to come to bed.
Helen, i'm worried.
It's almost midnight and my niece isn't back yet well, she's probably having a good time, that's what you wanted, isn't it?
It's not that, and my car's been overheating and i just don't want the m to go too far.
You don't have to worry, stanley, she's with jack.
Remember you know, you're right.
How far can they go?
Come to bed.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I just had a thought.
Well, there's a first tim e for everything.
Helen, guys like jack, is it possible they've got some normalness left over in them that could come out at any time?
Ey.
I don't know, stanl i mean, my niece is a beautiful girl, he could convert.
Don't worry ge.
I don't think j ack will ever chan you're not just saying that to make me feel better, are you?
No, stanley.
Because you read about it in the papers all the time, about people are getting changed from men to women and vice-versa.
How do they do it, helen?
They have an operation.
I know they have an operation, but how do they do it?
I can see them taking things off but how do they put them on?
Scotch tape.
Aren't you coming in?
Uh, well, it's kinda late , i don't think i should.
Oh, come on, just for a beer.
Um, okay.
One fast beer.
It doesn't have to be that fast i feel a little uneasy about your uncle roper.
Oh, don't worry about him my aunt helen says he sleeps through everything.
Here's your beer.
Jack.
You have been annoying me all evening.
Annoying you how?
I thought i'd been behaving like a perfect gentleman.
That's how.
I mean, there we were, stuck on the freeway for hours and the only thing you fiddled with was the radiator.
I fixed it, didn't i?
G you sure don't act like a man who's been livin with two women.
Well, every man's entitle d to a night off.
Not on my time.
I think you dropped something.
Well?
Oh, l-you want me to pick it up?
Jack?
Well, here goes my night off.
It's going to be a lovely dress we'll have the second fitting tomorrow night.
Good night.
You're not fooling me with that second fitting.
You don't even have a tape measure.
Maybe that's why they need a second fitting, stanley.
Don't try to protect them , helen, i've got eyes, i know what i saw.
Did you learn anything will you stay out of this, helen?
N. Mr. Roper, l-i can explai you don't have to explain anything.
Just get out.
Does this mean i can't finish my beer?
Just get out.
Get out of here, i mean out of this building.
Pack your things and leave.
Say good night to karen for me.
Don't you think you were a little harsh?
I wasn't harsh enough.
You saw what he was doing with my niece.
He was acting normal.
That's sick.
Hello?
Is somebody there?
Yeah, it's me.
Jack.
No chrissy, there's nobody there.
You don't have to get hostile just because i'm a little late, janet.
Get lost.
I have something i want to say- hey, you know something?
This cake is delicious.
Janet?
Chrissy?
Oh, i get it.
The silent treatment.
Oh, boy, if there's one thing i hate, it's the silent treatment look, i just came up to pack my things and say goodbye.
Goodbye.
Boy, are you sensitive.
You don't have to leave jus because you missed the party.
Even though it was a lousy thing to do.
And crummy.
And despicable.
And rotten.
Could we go back to the silent treatment?
You don't have to move out.
I'll get over it.
Roper won't.
Roper?
Yeah, i had a little trouble in his car.
Oh, what happened?
Did she say no?
Roper's car overheated on the freeway.
And roper's niece?
On the living room sofa.
And then roper came in and caught us and that's when the whole place boiled over.
Well, what happened?
Nothing.
But he kicked me out anyway.
I have to move.
Oh, jack.
Yeah.
Oh, we don't want to lose you.
Oh, that roper, he's got a lot of nerve throwing his weight around like that.
Hi listen you.
This is a partnership here.
And if you throw one of us out, then you throw us all out.
Right?
Right.
T. Righ what?
I came up to apologize for my niece.
What?
Well, she admitted she practically attacked poor jack here, and he showed no interest at all.
And the poor girl feels like she's over the hill.
Karen, over the hill?
Yeah, but it's okay now, i told her all about jack.
What'd you tell her?
Oh, just a little fairy story.
Anyhow, she's sorry and so am i but now, does that mean that he can stay?
Sure.
Sure.
Jack has his rights, just like any other minority.
We're so glad you can stay.
Oh, boy, i was sweating there for a minute.
So were we.
Yeah, but still, that was really mean of you not to come tonight.
Where were you all night?
Well, we drove around a lot and i had a special errand to run.
Oh, can it jack.
What kind of special errand is going to be- oh, janet, it's your cameo.
Oh, you bought it back from the pawn shop.
Um-hum.
Where'd you get the money for it?
Well, i couldn't waste roper's money on karen, could i?
Janet, oh, come on, you know how i hate the silent treatment.
Boy helen, the kids today are getting wilder and wilder, not like when we were young.
How long did we go together before i tried anything?
Well, let me see now- - i think we were marrie d about two years.
Three's company was videotaped in front of a studio audience.

He said i was in perfect shape.
Isn't that good?
Not to stanley y when he goes for a checkup he thinks he's wasting his mone im.
Unless the doctor find s something wrong with h there's plenty wrong with me.
I can't argue with that helen.
Oh, i'm sorry, stanley, did you tell him about your pain?
No, we didn't talk about you.
Oh, by the way, you wife was just telling me that day after tomorrow is a very special day.

"Charlie's angels"!
See?
I tried.
See ya later.
Ah, hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
I want you to talk to your roommate, chrissy, and warn her.
Okay-about what?
Ock well, i was looking out this window about three o'cl aked in the morning and i saw her walking around half-n wn.
In her nightgo what-oh my god-she's sleep walking, again!
D. Sleep walking-e h-this is a decent neighborhoo ep, now, if she wants to w alk in her sle you tell her to get dresse d before going to bed.
That's a brilliant idea!
All right, stanley, how did you just happen to be peeping out the window at three o'clock in the morning?
Peeping?
Me-i wasn't peeping.
L-i wanted to see what th e weather was like.
Then why didn't you look out our bedroom window?
And wake you up?
You wouldn't want me to wake yo up in the middle of the night, would you?
Heaven's no!
And break your perfect record?
You mean i walked out into the street in my nightie?
Oh, janet, i am so embarrassed!
Oh, hey, forget embarrassed.
I'm just glad that you weren't hurt, that's all now, chrissy, what's making you walk in your sleep this time?
Chrissy, what's bothering you- - what's- well, chrissy, what?
Oh, it must be mr.
Rogers.
His secretary's out sick and i' substituting for her this week.
Oh, is he giving you a rough time?
Oh, i just can't keep up with him.
He dictates too fast?
It's not his dictation- it's his hands.
The girls in the office call him christopher columbus.
What?
The explorer?
Hey, why don't you complain to his boss?
He is the boss you have got a problem.
Hi!
And the one thing i'm concerned about with now is the sleep walking, though.
Sleep walking-what are yo u talking about?
Jack, chrissy walked in her sleep last night right out into the street.
Are you serious?
How long has this been going on?
Oh, it started when i was a kid.
You know it wasn't easy being a minister's daughter i had to be the best in school, the best in bible class- and when i couldn't do that , i got so nervous, i started walking in my sleep.
Well, just relax.
I've got something that wil l take your mind off of it.
I wonder what he's up to this time.
What've you got oh what a sweet little thing.
Yeah- oh, oh, how cute.
Oh, where did you get him?
My friend, larry, gave him to me.
Honest larry- the used car salesman?
Only thing larry ever gave anyone was the business.
Oh, come on-just because he calls himself "honest larry" doesn't mean he's a croo k. Besides, this time i gave him the business.
How?
Well, larry has a soft spot for animals, and he wanted to get rid of this litter of pups so i took one.
And that's giving him the business?
Well, i also owed him $25 and i told him that if i took a puppy, he'd have to cancel the debt.
Ah, you've got a soft spot, too , right here.
What do ya mean?
We can't keep it.
Why not?
Oh, janet- oh, now come on, you guys, you know roper's rules- no dogs or babies allowed.
Oh yeah, well, we're keeping half of the bargain-so far.
If we keep this dog, mr.
Roper will cancel our lease.
We'll be out on the street!
She's right, ja ck.
Well, what am i supposed to do, now?
Hey.
Larry's not gonna take that dog back- that lousy, used car salesman!
Hi, larry, we were just talking about you!
Hi, jack!
Come on in!
You know larry.
Hi.
Sure-what are you giving away this time- your pet tarantula?
Larry, it's about the dog- me.
I know.
I know.
You don't have to tell oh, that's a relief.
I thought you'd object.
Why would i object isn't he something?

Why can't she sleep walk in the daytime?
Stop shouting.
You'll wake her.
I'm not shouting!
Owww ieeee!

I almost broke my neck on this garbage can.
I don't know how to do that quietly.
Ht- that's a girl-in the doo r-that's right-that's rig no- okay-no-no-no- that's it.
Go, now-back to bed.

She's getting back in bed is she really still asleep?
Yeah.
Oh boy, i hope she doesn' t keep walking all night.
Yeah, well, maybe i'll just leave my bedroom door open just in case.
Maybe not- well, i'll just go put some iodine on this graze.
Goodnight.
Don't worry about me.
It's just a flesh wound, i'll be fine.
Shh-shhh-shhh- you'll wake the ropers.
Quiet!
Shh!
If roper catches you, he'll sel l you to the burger joint on the corner!
What's the matter little, girl?
Hmm-hmm- what's going on?
Little thing can't sleep.
You know-maybe she's hungry.
Yeah.
You better feed her.
You wanna have some din-din , huh, little baby?
Watch out for that table.
Oh, boy.
Oh what are we gonna do?
Chrissy, chrissy?
Oh, that's cute!
Yeah, there's nothing a girl likes more than a little tickle on the tummy.
Not like that!
Like this.
Yeah, is that better?
Ooohhh, that is much better.
You are so beautiful!
A blanket.
Oh, no, it's warm enough in here.
Oh, ooohhhh, i love your eyes.
Ooohhh- here you go.
This is gonna make you feel so goooood.
Ooh-i could kiss every inch of you!
No, jack!
Not on the table!
On the floor is better- all right, you guys, knock it off!
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, doesn't anybody sleep at night anymore?
It's probably larry tryin g to sell some used ear plugs.
E?
You got a dog up her what makes you think that?
I've been hea ring a lot of whimpering.
Oh, you mean like this?
Yeah.
And, uh- when i hurt myself, i cry, and that's the way i cry.
You really are a very strange person.
You know, lucky for you, you don't have a dog up here, otherwise, you'd be out on the street, and that goes for all of you!
Toe- very strange.
We gotta get rid of that dog.
Oh, i hope jack finds someone to take her.
Yeah, but you know he's already made about 20 calls.
I feel so sorry for the poor little thing.
She's no place to go.
Are you kidding?
I counted six places she's gone already.
Ck?
Any lu no luck.
Here, would you take a look at this dog food?
See if it's supposed to be heated.
Oh, janet, i'm sorry to bother you but i need to borrow some milk.
Milk?
Milk.
Of course you can borrow some milk, mrs.
Roper.
Of course you can mrs.
Roper.
See i had a quart but it went sour.
Mr. Roper fixed our fridge, and you know how he fixes things.
Now it defrosts every time we flush the toilet.
How nice.
Chrissy, would you bring mrs.
Roper some milk?
Oh, you girls don't have to wait on me.
I'll get it myself.
Oh you wanna go into the kitchen yourself mrs.
Roper?
Do find it a trifle noisy in here, dear?
Come in, mrs.
Roper.
Hi, here you are.
Oh, thank you, chrissy.
Hello, jack.
Oh, oh, is that something you made in cooking school today?
Yes as a matter of fact, it is.
It's a beef borgignon oh, that's french isn't it uh, most of it.
That looks delicious!
Oh, but that's not enough for the three of you is it?
Uh, leftovers.
I was just throwing this out.
Oh, no, no, don't throw it out.
Oh yes, there's too much for us.
Yes.
Oh, well, it'll be a nice chang e for mr.
Roper.
The only time he tries something french is when he gets a side order with his big mac.
Mrs. Roper, i can't let you have that.
Why not?
Uh, well, it's uh, cold.
Oh, i'll heat it up in a jiffy.
Thanks, kids.
Sure.
Oh, what are we gonna do now?
I don't know.
I guess the little puppy will just have to go hungry.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hey, we can't let roper eat dog food.
Oh, why not?
It's only horse meat.
Well, you know a lot of people do eat horse meat.
Yeah, maybe with a b?
Éarnaise sauce but not with added bone meal and marrow bone jelly.
Maybe it'll give roper a nice glossy coat.
Besides maybe he just won't eat it.
Right, there is only one way to tell.
The next time we see roper, we'll throw a stick.
If he fetches- i think i'd better go down and stop him.
I fixed that drain pipe.
I must of gone up and down that ladder 50 times today.
Well, you should be getting the hang of it soon.
So much to do around here.
You know that ladder's really been a big help to me.
Why don't you bring it into the bedroom sometime?
I hope you got something good to eat.
I'm so hungry i could eat a horse!
Special treat for your tonight, stanley.
Jack made it.
It's beef borgignon.
What's all that j elly stuff in there it's supposed to be in there.
Ny.
Smells fun it's french!
Oh.
Why aren't you having some?
Oh, well, there wasn't enough for both of us so i'm just having this ste w that was leftover from last night.
Sure this stuff is good?
Oh, for heavens sake, stanley, jack made it.
It's a gourmet dish.
It's wonderful.
Then you eat it.
I'm gonna stick with the stew.
T. I'm not in the mo od to experimen you never are.
Your stew's not very good, but at least i'm used to it.
Oh, hi, jack.
I'm sorry to bust in on you like this.
I can't let you eat that, mr.
Roper.
Wait a minute-wait a minute!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
I'll just dump this down the sink here.
Helen, stop him!
I'll explain later, mr.
Roper.
That was my dinner.
Yes, well, goodnight.
He dumped my dinner down the sink.
I heard.
What is he, crazy or something?
Oh, he's probably just shy abou t people eating his cooking when he's still a student he dumped my dinner down the sink!
Oh, now don't get excited stanley.
My dinner's floating out to sea and you tell me not to get excited?
I'll fix you something else never mind, never mind.
I'll eat some of this french- - uh-whatever you call it janet, i've just been in the bathroom.
Oh!
Must you announce those things?
The puppy's not there, it's gone!
What?
I thought you took it to bed with you.
No, i wouldn't do that.
What about the fleas?
I don't think the dog would mind.
Janet, that little puppy could not climb out of the box herself.
Someone must have taken it!
Chrissy?
Yeah.
Chrissy!
Yeah?
Oh, jack!
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Oh, no, no.
Listen, that's my fault.
I shouldn't stick my nose into other people's doors ee?
Want some coff oh, no time, i've gotta get to work.
Chrissy, have you seen the puppy?
Oh, yeah.
The ropers have it.
What?
!
Chrissy, wait a minute!
How did that pup py get down there well i gave it to them.
At?
You wh why did you give it to the ropers?
Well, i had to find a good home for it and this way we have visiting rights.
Oh, good chrissy, you blew it.
Now, we've really had it.
The ropers know we were keeping a dog up here.
No they don't.
But if you gave it to them , they have to ah, ah-see, they don't k now that i gave it to them.
What'd you do, wear a mask?
No, i wore my robe.
See i put it out on their front door step this morning.
Oh, you didn't leave that little puppy down there all by itself did you?
Of course not.
I waited until i saw mrs.
Roper pick it up.
See, i put in a place where i knew they wouldn't miss it- on top of their morning paper.
I bet that put a damper on their news.
Chrissy, what made, what made you think that, uh, mrs.
Roper would want a dog?
Well, anybody who loves parakeets must love dogs.
What about mr.
Roper?
Well, i guess she loves him too, otherwise she wouldn't stay with him.
Chrissy!
I got to get to work, janet.
E!
Wait a minut good morning, chrissy.
Oh, ho, ho.
Isn't he darling?
Where did you get it?
Some blonde left him on my doorstep.
Oh, you saw me-i mean her ar.
I'm afraid so, de oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Hey, gee.
I must've been sleep walking again.
Yes, she walks around the neighborhood.
You always put on your robe and slippers before you go sleep walking, chrissy?
Uh, well, uh, mrs.
Roper, we can explain.
You see i know it looks really strange- did you tell him about that french food i ate last night?
Hey!
That's a dog.
Very good, stanley.
You ate that stu ff i sent down last night yeah.
What's a dog doing in my building?
I don't allow that.
Oh, now stanley, stop pretending.
It's the cutest little anniversary present you ever gave me.
What?
Happy anniversary, mr.
Roper.
Anniversary?
And what a darling way to give him to me- to surprise me that way- - leaving him on the doorstep.
Yeah, well- isn't that right, chrissy yeah.
Just what i always wanted.
Well l-i knew that.
Thank you, stanley.
Oh, i almost forgot the- - the reason i came up here- about that french food that i ate last night.
Oh, i'm sorry.
I thought i flushed that down the drain.
No, that was my wife's dinner.
Your stuff was delicious.
Do me a favor will you?
Give my wife the recipe.
I mean-the stuff she feed s ain't fit for a dog.

Okay, let's do the other end.
Okay.
Now we have to pull it really tight or else it won't hold springs, okay?
Okay.
Give a heave.
Okay, it's a good thing we've got a man living with us; otherwise, we'd have to do the heavy work ourselves.
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.
We have to pull together, okay?
All right.
Okay go!
Lying down on the job again, huh?
F. The moment my back is turn ed, the workers start goofing of where have you been?
You were supposed to help us fix this couch instead of out riding your bike.
I was doing it for you.
For us?
Well sure, i have to keep in shape don't i to protect you two?
Ol' watch dog jack, that's me.
Well, old watch dog jack was supposed to be back here an hour ago to help.
I know, i would have been, but as i was coming home i saw a bicycle in front of me with a girl on it.
Ah ha.
That 'ah ha' was uncalled for.
The only reason i noticed her at all was because her seat was jiggling all over the place.
So naturally you had to follow her, right?
Well, sure i was worried about her.
A loose seat can be very dangerous.
T. Especially with yo u behind i that was unworthy of you, janet.
I thought it was very good.
U. Thank yo anyway, i stopped her and i fixed her seat.
How about getting behind this couch and helping us fix it, huh?
No sweat.
Are you girls luck you got a man around this house.
Now watch and learn.
Hammer, please.
Tacks.
Okay.
Not just one, give me a whole handful.
Yes, but wouldn't it be easier if i held them?
Haven't you ever seen the way a real upholsterer works?
One at a time is a waste of time.
Careful!
There, see how easy that is?
How can you talk so clearly with all those tacks in your mouth?
I don't have- i'll get you some water.
No water, the tacks will get rusty.
What?
Oh!
Oh, my tooth!
What's all that thumping going on up there?
They're redecorating, stanley.
What for?
I already redecorated.
You did a very nice job, too, but i think the styles have changed since 1947.
It was two years ago.
I remember it perfectly because your mother was visiting.
Well, i don't see how anything could get that grubby in two years.
Don't look at me; it's your mother.
There, there it is stanley, look, look.
How would you like to see me coming to bed in that?
A golf cart?
The other page, stupid, the red see-thru nightie.
Rt.
You'd look be tter in the golf ca that's the trouble with you , stanley, you wouldn't even notice if i came to bed wearing nothing.
Oh, you're wrong there.
I'd be the first to complain.
Oh, why don't you go see your dentist?
What for?
Because your toothache is giving me a pain.
Then you go see the dentist.
The place i got a pain, you don't see a dentist.
All right i'll go.
I'll go tomorrow.
Yeah, you wait much longer and you'll be able to mail your teeth in.
Oh, that's cute, that's cute, helen, the way you'll step on a gu y when he's down.
Look, stanley, do me a favor and take a couple of aspirin.
A couple of aspirin won't stop this pain.
Then take the whole bottle.
That could kill me.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Ms. Merry widow.
Only joking, stanley.
But as long as your looking through that catalog, would you see if that nightie comes in black?
Let it down, let it down, let it down.
T?
How's tha pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!
It's on my foot!
Oh!
Oh, jack, oh, jack, we're sorry .

Oh, fine, nine toes are more than enough for anybody.
Oh.
Oh, are you okay?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Well, all right then, let's try it out.
Oh, hey, this is really firm now and comfortable.
Well, what do you expect when you got a man who knows how to put things together- okay, get up.
Come on, let's get it right.
Up, up, up.
Relax, will you, coach i would hate to work for you in your flower shop.
I bet you've got all the daisie s standing at attention.
He's right, janet, it's saturday.
I'd really like to get out.
Janet, it's o ur one day off.
Come on, come on, come on.
We have to have some time to- we agreed we were going to work on the apartment this weekend.
All right, well, i've had i t with this couch.
Okay, then we'll do the wallpaper.
Show it to him, chrissy.
This should be a thrill.
What do you think of this?
It's kind of plain, isn't it?
That's the back.
I knew that.
I like the back better.
Alright, you two, now let's get to work.
Fixing the couch or putting up the wall paper.
Or going to the pub.
I pick that one.
Let's go.
Moving out.
Oh, hey, wait for me.
So, once we got past the breakwater, i said to her, i said, "what do you say you and me go below and mess around"?

Thanks, jim.
Oh, yeah, they'd like two egg salads on white and i'll have a chicken sandwic on wheat toast.
Aw, ain't that a shame?
That poor guy got stuck with two broads.
I think i'll do him a favor rt.
You got a good hea yes, just watch the old pro in action.
Janet, look, fixing the couch is a man's job.
What?
Sure, men are just naturally stronger than women.
Oh, here we go all through the ages, men have been the builders, the protectors, the hewers of wood, while women have sat at home learning how to put on eye shadow.
Oh, come on.
Hi, honey, buy you a drink?
Oh, no thanks.
Go ahead, jack , we're really interested oh, excuse me, well what i meant was you just can't ignore the physical differences of- you know i've always been partial to blondes that's nice.
Have you thought about getting yourself a cocker spaniel?
Hey, you don't kn ow what you're missing why don't you take a walk?
R. I've got a 35 - foot cabin cruise all right, take a cruise.
Go ahead, jack.

Huh?
Oh well yes, in a sense, i mean we're all together hey sonny, do me a favor, butt out.
Listen, i think i should warn you- and i think i should warn you, the last guy who warned me about something got all his teeth knocked out.
Oh, well, i wouldn't want that to happen.
My father paid a fortune for my braces.
Come on, jeff, come on, you haven't finished your drink yes, right, right.
I'll be back here tomorrow, babe, but don't bring him along he frightens me.
Well, i didn't want to cause a scene.
No, no sense in that.
No.
You were perfectly right, jac k. I wasn't scared or anything , he just- hey, you did the right thing.
M. You st ood up to hi yes, and then you sat down again.
I mean that you didn't want to cause a scene.
Oh, hi kids.
Hi.
Re.
Hi the i'm in agony, helen.
This tooth is killing me.
But does anybody feel sorry for me?
Yes, stanley, you do.
Hey, jim, give him a brandy, will you?
Sure.
I don't know if i can open my lips wide enough to drink it.
Could you put it in a baby bottle?
You're mo uth giving you trouble?
Not as much as hers.
Oh!
You clumsy idiot.
Why don't you watch where you put your elbows, stupid.
Where do all of these stupid people come from, anyway?
Stupid?
Yeah.
Pop.
You're absolutely right, barkeep, give my friend here another brandy we just made an important discovery we just found a man in this joint.
Makes me feel real good to see a little runt like you stick up for his rights.
Thank you.
Let's see you two are the egg salad- thank you.
And i believe you're the chicken.
Good morning!
I am all ready and waiting for my cooking lesson.
Your what?
You're going to show me how to make a cheese omelet, remember?
Not today.
Oh, come on, jack, please?
Come on, the cheese is ripe.
You'll love it.
At?
What kind of a crack is th what?
Cheese.
You mean i'm a mouse not a man, i get it.
Well, i don't blame you janet, janet, you've go t to take the plastic wrap off before you slice it.
Don't you know anything gee whiz, what's bugging you?
I was just thinking of what a coward i was last night.
You were not a coward.
I was yellow; let's face it i've got chicken in my blood.
Aw, come on jack, cut it out.
Even the kids at school could spot it.
Fat kenny jensen would threaten to beat me up every morning unless i gave him a nickel.
What did you do?
I put him through college.
Aw, come on, jack.
You did the right thing last night.
Remember, he who fights and runs away, lives to fight another day.
S?
Will you can i t with the proverb ay.
Besides, i didn't fig ht and run aw t. That's the whole poin well, he who doesn't figh t and runs away, lives to run another day.
I'm going to shave.
Hey wait; aren't you going to show me how to make my omelet?
Me?
I couldn't even beat up an egg.
Who's there?
Oh, i'm sorry, chrissy.
I didn't know you were in here.
I am taking a shower.
Do you mind?
I won't be a minute.
I'll just get my shaving stuff and split.
Hey, when are you going to fix the lock on that door?
Why don't you call a man to do it?
We've got a man, you.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Hey, you can't see through this curtain, can you?
No, that's why i bought this can.
It dissolves plastic instantly.
Jack, i am warning you.
If you- chrissy, chrissy, i am so down this morning; i couldn't even raise a smile.
Why?
Do you think i'm a coward oh, come on, don't take i t so seriously.
I mean, you did the right thing not doing anything.
I mean, if you would have done something, he would have done something, and you wouldn't be able to do anything, would you?
What?
Will you forget about last night?
We don't think badly of you we like you just the way you are, with a face and everything.
Pow!
Pow!
Pow, pow, pow, pow!
Oh, here's your sunday breakfast, stanley.
Look, helen, i still got it!
Where?
You saw how i stood him up to him, eyeball to eyeball.
Eyeball to navel, you mean.
He was shaking, helen.
He was trying to control his laughter, stanley.
He apologized.
Yes, he was afraid of what might happen if he hit you.
I know what would have happened.
Yeah, i know what woul d have happened, too l. I'd have been able to buy t hat black nightgown after al see what you did?
You brought the pain back.
Y. Oh, i'm sorry, stanle t. I thought you we re very brave last nigh thank you.
Where's the sunday paper?
T. Oh, it hasn't come ye maybe i made the sports page.
Or the funnies.
That's funny, really funny.
Any coffee left?
Yeah.
Hey, how come we got the sunday paper delivered?
We don't have a subscription.
Well, i don't know.
I heard it land on the front balcony this morning so i went out and got it.
Oh.
You know, that paper boy was so thoughtful.
He waited for me to bend over and pick it up before he rode away.
You enjoying the funnies, jack?
Yeah.
Oh.
That's good.
I'm glad you found something to take your mind off last night.
There's this little guy, you see, and he's being tormented by his foreman who's this big bully- and then over here, the little guy dumps a can of paint on the bully's head- and why couldn't i have done that?
Because you can't draw.
Besides, it's pretty hard to find a can of paint in a pub.
All over the world, little guys are standing up to tyrants, but not me.
Well, i hate violence.
In fact, my father always told us in his sermons, "he who lives by the sword, shall die by the sword".
Yeah, well you can tell your father that if i had been david, goliath would still be alive today.
Come on, jack, will you stop putting yourself down?
If i had any guts i would have rung his neck.
I would have stood up to him and torn him apart.
Good morning.
Er i was wonderin g if my sunday pap e?
Was delivered here by mistak your sunday paper?
T, yeah, you know i love to l ook at the funnies over breakfas especially "andy capp.

Why would anybody do this to andy capp?
Oh, mr.

Where's the rest of the paper?
Well, i think it's in the- - excuse me, i think it's right in here.
Roper's paper-oh, my lor d, what happened?
Roper?
I knocked the coffee pot over.
Well, he's right out there.
Listen, will you hurry?
I got to- it was an accident.
What am i supposed to do with this?
Well, maybe if mrs.
Roper put it in the dryer?
You ruined my sunday, i hope you realize that.
Mr. Roper, we're really sorry.
R look, to make up for it, why don't i buy you a bee down at the pub tonight?
You're not going to go down to the pub again tonight- what?
Oh, hey, i was thinking it would be so great to stay home tonight and relax.
Ah.
Oh, ye oh, oh, i heard about you and that fellow.
You know, he never should have picked on somebody like you.
What's that supposed to mean?
Ht; well, you could never get into a fig ls.
It would ruin your nai ng.
You kn ow, jack did the right thi d. Fighting's uncivilize yeah.

Pictures, plants, lamp, uh, well nothing seems to be missing.
Jack.
Ng nothing seems to be missing, janet, so you have nothi to worry about unless the burglars are still here.

Ope but underneath that litt le radio was an envel cash.

He was looking in our bedroom window and yawning.
D. You must have be en getting undresse se?
Where'd you get tho oh, chrissy gave them to me, aren't they beautiful?
Yeah, almost as good as mine.
They are yours; she got them from your garden.
She what now, don't get mad, stanley.
It's the thought that counts.
You know, i think we ought to do something for those kids in return, like, uh, well, take them out to dinner.
R?
Take them out to dinner-what fo well, just to be neighborly.
I don't want to be neighborly t if they would move out, i could rent that apartmen ey.
For a lot more mon aw, come on, stanley.
It-it'd be fun.
Please.
Careful, you're using u p my hair ther e. Oh, come on, stanley, just a little something to give them pleasure.
You were young once.
Do you remember the little things that used to give you pleasure?
Watching the wright brothers fly for the first time?
Aw, come on, stanley.
Come on.
All righ t. I'll invite the m out to dinne r. It'll give me a res t from your cookin g. Good.
Okay.
You go and invite them, and i'll look for something to wear oh, are you coming too?
$300 and we're wiped out.
Do you realize how long it takes me to save $300?
How long?
Now.
I don't k ing.
I'm still sav oh, boy, do i know what you mean, chrissy.
Ry.
Well, i can just c no, chrissy, crying won't help anything.
What we've got to do is raise the $300 for this month's rent.
That was last month's rent.
We're already a month behind.
Well, we've g ot to raise the money somehow maybe we can sell something i've only got one thing worth selling and i was hoping to save that until i got married.
My grandmother's wedding ring.
Maybe-maybe we should just tell roper.
Nd.
Yeah, any reasonable man would understa oh, you're right, we can't tell roper.
R?
Tripper, jack trippe yeah.
Oh, yes, that's me, officer i'm the one who phoned in about the stolen money.
Oh, no, no, no, no, officer, there are no signs of forcible entry.
You know, we don't know how those burglars got in here.
Well, this key might give us a clue oh, we keep that out there for our own use.
No one else is supposed to use it.
Is there anything else missing?
Yes, sir, a transistor radio, black with a silver dial, the volume knob is missing.
No, you're forgetting, i took that to be repaired.
Which chrissy took to be repaired, so it's not missing, sir.
Tell me, are you in the habit of leaving $300 in cash lying around?
We're not in the habit of having $300.
That was our rent money.
You see, every week we colle ct some money for the pot oh, i mean the kitty.
And you, uh, kept this cash hanging around loose?
Of course not.
Se.
It wasn't loo nt" it was in a big wh ite envelope with the word "re printed on it.
Oh, this, uh, $300, do you have the numbers of the notes?
Yes.
S. Two of them were fifti es, fifteen of them were ten ng?
And there was noth ing else missi well, not exactly missing, but there are always things we can't find, small things, you know, like lipstick or- k?
You can't f ind your lipstic no, uh, janet or chrissy's or my odd socks.
I mean those items are not exactly missing, they're just lost.
I mean they're always here somewhere but you can't find them, but that's not quite what you're talking about is it?
They didn't tak e the television set v. I wonder why t hey didn't take the t have you seen some of these new shows?
Look, officer, we are really in a bind here.
You see, if we tell our landlord that we can't pay the rent, he won't believe us.
N, but if you tell him that the money was stole he'll believe it.
What a super idea, janet.
Thank you.
N?
You want me to tell the landlord that the rent money is stole please?
T?
How many times have yo u pulled this stun what stunt?
Oh, come on, son, you're no t dealing with a rookie.
L. Next time you want to fake a burglary, make it look rea fake?
V, break up a few thing s, get rid of the t nd and think up a better stor y than leaving $300 lying arou t." In an envelope marked "ren pid.
Nobody's that stu we are.
N. You know, you're lu cky i don't run you all i hey, wait a minute.
Yes, sir?
Thank you for not running us all in, officer.
He didn't even read us our rights what time is it?
Six o'clock oh, that means roper will be here any minute to collect the rent.
Oh, he warned us last month if we don't have that money today- oh, he won't really throw us out.
Oh.
Are you kidding?
He would enj oy throwing us out.
Oh, god what are we going to do?
All right.
We're going to buy the only time.
We'll go down to the pub and hide out.
Why it's mr.
Roper.
Look at mr.
Roper.
It's mr.
Roper.
Hi.
Hi.
How you doing there?
I'm fine, thank you i just came here to tell you mr.
Roper, would you like to step inside for just a moment?
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Like i was saying, i told the wife, you know, they're really not bad kids , why don't we invite them to dinner tonight?
Are you still sulking about those kids walking out on you?
It.
I don't want to talk about we discussed it enou gh last night you mean i discussed it.
You fell asleep right in the middle.
P. I did not fall aslee you did too.
You fall asleep in the middle of everything.
You know, i don't know how you do it, helen.
Do what?
You've only been up a hal f an hour but your tongue has already put in an eight hour shift.
T?
Why'd they run aw ay from me like tha you know, maybe there's something about you that i've grown used to that other people still notice.
Your tongue just went into overtime oh, you know, stanley, you shouldn't blame the kids.
It was probably just a misunderstanding.
Not on my part you're right, dear.
I am?
Yes.
So why don't you go up there again tonight and ask them out to dinner?
After what they did to me, no, i'm not taking them any place.
Why should i?
For me.
You've got to giv e me a better reason.
All right, i will.
Now, i have a lot of things i was going to do today.
I was going to go shopping.
I was going to go to the beauty parlor.
I was going to have a walk on the beach, but i'm giving that all up so i can stay home with you and talk.
And talk, and talk- helen.
While you're reading your newspaper, while you're watching the tv, while you're taking your nap.
All right.
I'll do it.
Oh, thank you, stanley.
You're not welcome.
What are we going to d o about the rent r. We can't go on avoidi ng roper foreve what about that boss of yours, that one who's always chasing you around, you think you could get an advance out of him?
Only if i let him catch me.
Where's jack?
Oom.
He's in the bathr still?
And they talk about women.
You know, he stays in that bathroom twice as long as we do.
E. Well, he has to shav we have to put on our makeup.
E. And he likes to read in ther oh.
He says it kills two birds with one stone.
Good morning.
How you doing?
Oh, gee.
Do you have to walk around the house in your underwear?
This is not underwear, it's my bathing suit.
I ran out of clean shorts.
T. Oh, well, in that ca se it's all righ why wasn't it all right before?
R. Because before i thought it was your underwea yeah, but it's still the same shorts.
You can't tell the difference.
I can.
How?
Because your underpants have giraffes on them.
You don't catch us walking around the apartment in our underwear.
You've been too quick for me.
Hey, don't you have any friends who can loan us some money?
The guys i know don't have that kind of dough, except charlie; he suddenly came into a lot of money.
Well, call him.
I can't, he's in jail.
You're a big help.
Well, how about you two, you should be able to raise some money.
Hey, why don't we have a garage sale?
We don't have a garage.
We could rent one.
With what?
With the money we make from the sale, dummy?
How about you, janet, can you get a loan?
Oh, forget it.
I always have trouble getting loans, even though i go in there with ten impeccable references.
What's the trouble?
They always check them out.
Well, i guess no loans.
Loans.
Yes, loans.
No, no loans, yes loans.
Yes, loans is the key.
He's really flipped out.
Should i call a doctor or get a net?
Why didn't i think of that before?
I'm such an idiot.
That's the answer; there is a financial aid department at my school.
They give loans to students in need.
Fantastic.
They have to make up a really sad story.
Well, you've got one.
Hum?
You were robbed, weren't you?
Yeah.
And if you don't pay the rent, they're going to throw you out in the street.
Yeah.
And just to clinch it, tell them you've got two weak girls depending on you.
Yeah.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Can i tell them you're pregnant get out of here.
Now, there's just a few questions.
Uh, what did you want this money for?
Well, the rent money was stolen, our apartment was burgled, they just smashed right in.
Dear, dear.
You know, sometimes i think it would be better just to leave the front door open.
We'd probably be safer that way i mean, burglars would think it was a trick and not come in.
There's one thing i'd li ke to mention, mr.
Travis, i don't have any collateral jack, as a student here all you have to prove is need.
Oh, we need, we need.
That's good enough for me oh, now, you said we, does that mean you share the apartment?
With a couple of roommates who don't have any money either and since it's harder for a woman to get a loan then a man, i decided it was up to me, so here i am.
You're living with a woman?
Oh, um, yeah, but that won' hurt my application, will it?
Ke.
Jack, jack, this is the ' 70s, for heaven's sa i mean, this is a colleg e, not a monastery.
You a loan approva l doesn't depend on how e. Conduct your private lif oh, good.
O?
She doesn't happen to b e a student to oh, no, she's a typist.
Oh yes, uh, well, that's all right o?
Now, uh, what does you r other roommate d oh, uh, she works in a flower shop.
I really appreciate this, mr.
Travis.
You live with two girls?
You know, what's so nice is that you seem to have a terrific understanding of my problems.
It's a real load off my mind, believe me.
Two girls?
That's right.
Well, now, uh, well, uh, how long did you want to take to pay this off, i mean, six, twelve, eighteen months?
Oh, may as well go for the eighteen, huh?
May as well.
You live with two girls?
You'd like them.
They're lovely, hard working.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, now- $300, are you sure this is going to be enough?
I don't believe in biting off more than i can chew.
You don't?
Let's see.
I figure, what, $300.
If i can save $20 a- two girls?
Mr. Travis, i really don't want that to bother you.
I promise i'll pay back the loan.
I know i work a six hour school day and i have to study all night, but i also find time to pick up part-time jobs when when?
What can i tell you, i almost had the money right in my hand and then mr.
Travis asked me about my father and that ruined it.
Are you illegitimate?
No.
He wanted to know how much my father made for a living.
Oh, oh, i see.
So he could be sure you'd pay the loan back.
No, so he could be sure i couldn't.
I don't get it.
Neither did i. You see, my father earns over $6,000 a year, which means i am not a hardship case.
How about that?
If my father were poor and starving, we'd all be sitting pretty.
Lousy break.
What a what are we going to do now?
I've got a thought.
We mustn't despair.
Ht?
Well, what's your thoug that's it, we mustn't despair.
We don't need philosophy, jack, we need money.
It's the ropers.
I'm taking a shower.
That'll keep him out for the night, huh?
Are you kidding?
Keep him out?
He'll be back as soon as he figures it out.
It's the pub for us again grab your coats and let's get out of here okay.
How'd they get away this time?
Hold it.
Come back here.
This time nobody's leaving.
Helen, lock that door.
Come on, kojak, why don't you just tell them why you came.
In.
Look, we can expla i don't want any explanation.
I just want yes or no.
All right, no, with an explanation.
No?
You mean you don't want to have dinner with us?
What?
T?
He's trying to in vite you out to dinner tonigh is that all?
Well, maybe we can go bowling afterwards.
We acc ept and thank you very much.
My pleasure.
My idea.
My money.
Oh, wow, and here all along we thought you were coming up to collect the rent.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You say someth ing about the rent i don't remember.
Because you already paid it.
No, mr.
Roper, she didn't- - we did?
Yeah, you remember i came up to fix the sink yesterday?
There was an envelope that said rent on it, so naturally i took it.
Oh, we thought we'd been robbed we had the police here and everything.
Why didn't you leave us a receipt?
A receipt.
I always-do you think i would take something without leaving the receipt?
Look here's my receipt book right here.
See, here's my copy and there's your copy.
Thanks.
We all make mistakes.
Don't put yourself down , stanley; ne.
You do it better than anyo let's go eat.
I'm starved.
Oh, me too.
Helen, i'll take care of you later.
