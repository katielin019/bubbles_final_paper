{START OF EPISODE 1}
Hey, Belson, you got cab 2452!
Tony, get out of cab 2452.
We need it.
Harry!
8622-- Wash it!
It's filthy!
Hey, Tony, you get creamed in your fight last night?
What's it like having a cauliflower back?
I didn't get creamed.
I lost on the decision.
I'm impressed.
The referee decided I was bleeding too much.
Hey, Alex, want to go for breakfast?
No, I can't.
Hey, Alex.
Hi, Alex.
Hi.
Hi, guys.
I'm sorry I didn't have anything smaller than a $50 but I only had $150 in the bank and I took it all out to come to New York, and they gave me three 50s Yeah.
and so, you see Look, I'm sorry I had to bring you back here just to get change.
Oh, are you kidding?
This is the New York kind of thing I've always dreamed of.
Maybe you want to buy one of our postcards.
Anybody here got change for a $50?
Yeah, I got it.
Hey, had a good night, huh, Alex?
Very funny.
Here you go.
Now, how much was that again?
$4.85.
There's five, and, uh This going to take much longer?
I'm sorry.
I want to give you a tip.
It's just difficult to figure out what 15% of $4.85 is when somebody's looking at you.
No, no pennies, thanks.
No pennies.
Uh, may I use the phone?
I have to find someplace to stay.
Yeah, right there.
Oh.
Uh, do you have?
Huh?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Hey, Alex.
Yeah.
They called me back for Equus.
Oh, you see?
I told you.
Hey, what's Equus?
Hey, don't give me a look like that.
I could ask a question.
A lot of people don't know about that.
It's a play.
It's a play about a psychiatrist and a boy who worships horses.
So, before I go in there, I say straight to them: "Gentlemen, you're looking at the man you're gonna hire".
So that gets their interest up real quick, right?
Oh, yeah.
Right, right.
Hey, what part are you trying for?
Listen, soon as I finish over there, I'll come over here and I'll tell you everything, okay?
Until then, have a piece of gum.
Oh, thanks.
Why didn't you tell him what part?
Because, Alex, he won't understand.
Try him.
But, Alex, he won't Go ahead, try him.
Take a chance.
Okay.
I'm up for the part of the horse.
Yeah?
Which end?
Gee, this phone is terrific.
Yeah?
We hoped you'd like it.
No, no, I mean, this plate's broken, see?
You just put your money in, and it comes right back.
You can call anywhere for free.
Look.
Okay, behind me.
That's right, calm yourselves.
I got here first.
Hey, Alex, don't you want to make a call?
No, I don't have anybody to call.
There's got to be somebody somewhere you want to call.
No, well, no, not now.
Hello?
Is this the National Theater of London, England?
Yeah.
I'd like to speak to Sir Laurence Olivier, please.
Yeah, it's Bobby Wheeler from New York City calling.
No, it's not personal.
I'm an actor, too.
This is the National Theater of London.
That is a good call.
Hello?
I can't believe it.
I I didn't think I could get you on the phone.
Oh, wow.
Laurence Olivier's secretary.
Listen, uh Do you think that I could talk to him, please?
Oh.
Well, uh what's he doing?
Oh, wow.
No kidding?
Taking a curtain call?
Well, don't bother him.
Just just tell him that a guy no that an actor named Bobby Wheeler just called to say that Yeah.
Hey, hey, thanks for listening.
That is a great phone, man.
Hey, Alex, you want to take my turn?
Uh, no, thanks, Tony.
You go ahead.
Well, if you're sure, I think I'll make a little one myself.
Operator.
Yeah, I'd like to call Bangkok, Thailand.
Yeah, when I was in Vietnam, I went R&R in Bangkok.
Met a girl I just can't get out of my mind.
Just crazy about her.
Classiest lady I ever met.
Yes, operator, I want the VIP Massage Parlor.
Okay, I'll deposit the money.
Excuse me?
Uh, my name's Elaine Nardo.
They told me to ask for Louie.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Louie De Palma.
Oh, hi.
I hope there's no trouble.
If there is, I'll be glad to help in any way I can.
Oh, no, no.
It's just that they told me I'd be starting work today as a driver.
Here's my hack license.
You're a cab driver?
What do you mean busting my chops here making believe you're a regular person?
Go wait over there.
I'll call your name and number.
Till then, keep your mouth shut!
What's wrong?
Don't they feed you in there?
Whoo!
Whoo-whoo!
Hey, witty person.
Fill out this form-- and I hope you fill it out better than you fill out your pants.
See, we're all fun here.
Now, you mustn't be too upset with Louie, miss.
He's really a very nice guy.
He'd give you the scales off his back.
Well, I don't have to worry about him.
I'm only going to be working here part-time.
Oh.
I have this other job Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know.
We're all part-time here.
I'm part-time.
I only work No, really-- I really work as a receptionist at an art gallery.
Oh, yeah?
No, I'm not really a taxi driver.
No, no, I understand.
You see that guy over there?
Now, he's an actor.
The guy on the phone, he's a prizefighter.
This lady over here, she's a beautician.
The man behind her, he's a writer.
Me, I'm a cab driver.
I'm the only cab driver in this place.
Why is everyone here just a little angry?
Hey, it's ringing.
Excuse me, miss.
You're a very interesting person, but I'm not sure you're as interesting as a massage parlor in Bangkok.
Well, don't be too sure till you know me better.
Oh No, no, I'm kidding.
I'm not serious.
I'm all talk, really.
Please.
I'm all talk.
Oh, well back to the massage parlor.
Hello, this is PFC Tony Banta.
I'm calling from the USA.
I'd like to speak to Number 12.
She's not, huh?
Hey, is there any way I could reach her?
Oh.
Well, so long.
Since the war's over, they only go up to nine.
Hey, was that a crazy call I made?
I mean, do you think number 12 ever thinks of me?
How many times you ever see her?
Ten or 20 times.
How long were you in Bangkok?
A day.
Yeah, I think she remembers you.
Hey hey, Alex, this is fun.
Why don't you make a call?
No Come on.
Actually, I was thinking there for a second about calling my, uh, my kid.
Hey, I didn't know you had a kid!
Oh, well Wow!
A boy or a girl?
Girl.
Hey, Alex, how come you never brought her?
'Cause I haven't seen her in 15 years.
Yeah, 15 years.
My ex-husband was right.
He's not the worst there is.
Oh, so you made up your mind about me already, huh?
I'm a heel.
I abandoned my daughter and now you're going to shun me, huh?
Well, let's put it this way: I'd rather be on a desert island with him.
Don't you wish.
Now, wait a minute Now, wait a minute.
Listen, Miss, uh, Elaine Nardo, you know, things aren't always as pat as they seem.
Divorced mothers taking care of their children against incredible odds, while the men are free to stay out all night, join a gym, and take advantage of girls named Debbie.
Now, look-- my wife, for example.
She married this gentleman from South America.
Moved there with the kid, and told me that if I really loved my daughter, I wouldn't contact her because it would cause too much confusion.
She told me that if I really wanted to be a good father, I would allow this gentleman from South America to adopt her.
Show you what a how smart I was, I bought it.
I'm sorry about what I said before.
You're not a heel.
You're a jerk.
I accept your apology.
A giant jerk.
Listen, no matter what you agreed to before, it shouldn't stop you from picking up that phone right now and calling your daughter.
Leave the man alone.
If he doesn't give a damn about his kid that's his business.
Hey, now, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
All right, I'll call her!
I'll call her tomorrow when the line isn't so long.
You are going to feel so much better, I promise you.
I feel like we're getting married at Annapolis.
Yes, operator, Rio De Janeiro.
Yes, I can hold.
I have no idea what I'm going to say to this kid.
Latka!
Where you going?
!
Latka, I don't want you hanging around the drivers.
I need you on the third level to fix the cabs.
That's telling him, Latka.
Latka, no, this is a very important phone call.
It's a very bad time for English lessons right now.
Please.
All right, all right.
While I'm waiting.
What is it?
Eh Lesson 12.
Mm.
Thank you, chambermaid, for your excellent service.
I am glad I don't require medical assistance.
Yeah, listen, that, uh, that's that's very good, that's very good but those phrases all have "chambermaid" every other word.
Why don't you take a look at the phrases I wrote in the back of the book?
Here, look: "Get off my back".
"Give me a minute while I go to the can".
Study those.
Yes, operator, I'm here.
"Get off my back".
Uh, Latka later.
Yes, uh, is Mrs., um-- Oh, what the hell's her name now-- Consuelos there?
Consuelos?
Phyllis Bornstein Consuelos?
Yes, thank you.
Yeah, sure.
Bed?
No bed.
No bed?
Thank you very much.
Hello.
Hello, Phyllis.
Hello, Phyllis.
Uh I'm not sure I know what to say to you.
Oh, yeah, that would be a good place to start.
Alex Rieger.
Yeah.
Uh good.
Uh, listen, Phyllis, I was just thinking about Kathy, uh Can I speak to her?
Oh.
When did she leave?
Why Portugal?
Well, that's no answer.
Why is she going to college in Portugal?
What's her major, sardines?
Hey, wait a minute!
That means she'll be coming through New York.
Oh, Miami?
Well, listen, uh if you speak to her, tell her I'm sorry I missed her.
Wait a minute.
What time will she get into Miami?
If I want to meet her in Miami, I'll meet her in Miami.
Well, what time tomorrow?
Okay.
Well, I don't know.
I'll think about it.
I might!
Okay, what?
Flight 936.
Thank you.
Phyllis, just hold on a second.
Phyllis, did you ever sort of think about us and me neither.
Yeah, okay, right.
So long.
Good-bye.
Louie?
Yeah?
I need a cab for the weekend.
I'm going to Miami.
No!
Aw, come on, Louie.
I'm very tight on time.
I got to leave now.
No!
Let's take it.
Hold everything!
Okay, I got to get tough with you guys.
We don't let cabs out no more.
Oh, come on, Louie, it's very important.
What about 1621?
Nobody wants 1621!
No!
Hey, hey, hey, can I go along?
Yeah, sure.
I don't have anything else to do.
I'll have it back for you by the end of the weekend.
Alex, I run this garage, and no one takes my cabs for joyrides.
All right.
Come on, let's take it.
Give me a minute while I go to the can.
Thank you very much.
Wouldn't it be weird, after all this trouble, if we got there too late?
Don't worry about it.
We'll make it.
I once had to be in Miami in a hurry for a fight.
I drove it in 23 hours all by myself.
Wow, what a drive.
I swallowed a whole handful of uppers.
You know, when the guy knocked me out, I couldn't close my eyes.
Could I have your ticket and passport please?
No, no.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm looking for someone.
She's supposed to be leaving from this gate-- Kathy Consuelos.
She's here.
Oh, my God!
Would you like me to page her for you?
No, no, no.
If there's anything to genetics I should be able to figure out which one she is.
Well, Alex, good luck.
Okay.
Wait over there.
Don't worry, we're not going to leave you.
WOMAN : National Airlines flight 409 to San Francisco now departing from gate 28.
Hmm?
Kathy Consuelos?
Yes?
Son of a I beg your pardon?
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
I, uh I'm I'm sort of your father.
You're Mr. Rieger?
Yes, right.
Rieger.
Right.
Yes.
Well Well I've been wondering about you.
Yeah, same here.
There's so much time to cover.
: Iberia flight 936 for Lisbon, now boarding and will depart in five minutes.
That gives us less than 30 seconds for each year.
We may have to skip the '60s.
Listen, would you like to sit down?
Please.
You know, I was always wondering what you looked like.
Well, I'm much better-looking than this.
You are very pretty.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey, we're getting along great.
How did you know I was gonna be here?
Oh, fathers know these things.
Do you know anything about me?
I mean, uh what have you heard?
Just that you're living up on a ranch in Montana and you're thinking of running for United States Senate.
Oh Well, I got some bad news for you.
I lost the senate race.
No, I think your mother is trying to make me into much more of an exciting guy than I am, but the real story is almost as good.
I'm a New York cab driver.
Well, why wouldn't she want to tell me about that?
Well, I guess she didn't want to impress you.
You know, there's so much I want to ask you and I'm very aware of our time limit here.
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.
Well, like father, like daughter.
Hey, what's wrong?
You really want to know?
Yeah, sure, Kath.
What is it?
You're not going to like it.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Well, it's just that you keep on saying "father".
You're not my father.
Well, I am sorry.
You're not my father.
My father is a man that has raised me for as long as I can remember.
Hey, come on.
That's not exactly true.
Sure, it is.
Exactly true.
Wait a minute.
I I I raised you for two years.
I mean that's not long but at least I got two years.
You must remember some of that time.
You mean you remember something from 15 years ago?
Yes, of course.
Like what?
Well, um like the fact that when you were born, the doctor had to turn you so you could get out the right way.
Life started right there.
Like the fact that you used to look annoyed at me when I gave you a 2:00 a.m. feeding and I couldn't figure out why it was you who was annoyed.
You hardly crawled.
You went right to walking.
You used to sneeze like a cat.
I even remember your favorite food: strained peas.
Yeah, you used to send it back if you got chopped peas.
I remember your favorite joke: Got your nose.
Which is no longer your favorite joke.
Listen, Kathy you can rap me for a lot: copping out telling myself that I was letting you out of my life for your good, when the truth is I was looking for the easy way out myself.
So, please, don't tell me that I don't remember the experience of having a daughter for two years.
I mean, please, don't tell me that, because I really do.
: I remember.
: Iberia flight 936 for Lisbon final boarding at gate 10.
Hey, listen, uh when you wear your bag over your shoulder always wear it with the clasp on the inside.
It's safer that way.
All right.
And don't trust guys who wear scarves over here.
Don't trust guys who go too far down with the buttons on their shirt.
And don't trust guys who wear too much religious stuff around their neck.
I mean, uh, don't trust guys.
Hey, uh Hey, listen, in case you want to write, uh..
here.
Uh, here's something with my address on it.
Oh.
But it's your driver's license.
Oh.
Aw, go ahead.
That way you can have a picture of me, too.
Well, listen, so long.
I mean, it was nice talking to you.
Same here.
I think I have your smile.
Yeah?
That's funny.
I just got it two seconds ago.
Well Listen, you better go.
Hey, Alex, your daughter she's beautiful.
Yeah, well, thank you.
Well, it was sweet while it lasted.
Hey, everybody.
Guess what?
I got my hack license.
Oh, boy.
You miss Rona Barrett one morning, you lose touch.
Bobby I didn't expect to see you here.
I thought you got that job on Equus.
No, uh they went another way.
Nah, it's cool, you know?
No, really it's cool.
It's cool.
Oh, thanks.
Okay, we got a lot of cabs here.
Rieger, 214.
Banta, 8367.
Nardo, 1532.
Wheeler, 999.
Not 999!
Hey, Gravas!
Fix the horn on 816.
Hey, Burns Bring your license here.
All right.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Okay, Luche, you got 212.
Perleman, you got cab 814.
Susman, you got Nine fifty-one.
And Zelinko, you got cab 636, and wash it!
Come on.
Come on.
Let's get this garage moving here.
Latka.
It hurts me to see you not working.
It makes me want to press a nerve in your neck.
Says you.
Did you fix this cab?
It's all fixed?
Let me take a look here.
I don't need that.
Everything works?
Whistle-clean?
So there's nothing more to do.
Ooh!
Now you can put that back.
And you know why I did that, Latka?
Because you are a terrible person.
Yes.
I'm telling you, Tony.
I booked $120.
Never.
Hey, man.
It's the truth.
Now, I was really hot tonight, and I booked $110.
Now, what can I tell you?
The truth.
You know, I can't believe it.
I just can't believe the man's standing here telling me to my face that I can't book $100.
I mean, I just can't believe it.
Oh, man, you always lie about your bookings.
On whose life?
On whose life should I swear that I booked $90, huh?
On whose life?
Hey, Bob, what'd you book?
Eighty.
Hey, Rieger!
Haul your sweaty carcass over here this second.
Did you detect mellowing?
: All right, Louie.
I'm coming.
Hey, John, how you doing?
Well, I'm trying to figure this out Look I'm going to have to let your buddy John go.
I thought I'd tell you first, 'cause he's your boy.
You brought him in, so I'm giving you the choice.
I can leave a note in his pay envelope saying "You're through, loser".
That's the nice way.
Or I could simply Look, Louie, Louie.
All I ask is give him some time.
He'll get his bookings up.
No way.
Come on, Louie.
Be fair.
And start a precedent?
All right, look.
You lose him, you lose me.
Got it?
Whoo!
A threat.
I heard a threat.
And I'm your best booker.
Ooh, a threat with an explanation.
Louie he goes, I go.
A threat that worked.
Banta, I got a phone message for you.
Yeah?
What was it?
You know the rules.
Give me a buck.
Here's a dollar.
Your gym called.
Oh!
What'd they say?
That information will cost you another buck.
Here's another buck.
They didn't say nothing.
Well, if they're so unhappy with me, why haven't they let me go?
John, that possibility has not been overlooked.
Gee, I didn't know it was that serious.
Alex, if I lose this job, I'll have to drop out of school All right, come on, come on, just relax.
Look, you're not that far from making it.
All you need is a little street savvy-- I mean, something that only experience can teach you.
All right, now look, the first thing you got to know Hey, you guys talking dirty?
No.
Oh.
Alex is just teaching me some taxi tricks he's learned over the years.
Yeah, this might be good for you, too.
Come on, sit down.
Sure.
Now don't feel bad if you don't know this stuff.
This is ten years talking to you now.
Okay, now, first, your airports.
The best day to go to the airport is Sunday, because the traffic is light, and the wait is short.
There are also times you shouldn't go to the airport.
Now, not many people know this Hey, hey, hey you want a great tip?
Here it is.
Never pick up a cripple.
Louie!
That is the rottenest thing I ever heard.
You know, I'm not even going to bother to tell you why, but first of all, you don't call them "cripples".
You call them "handicapped persons".
You're right.
I'm embarrassed.
Okay.
Okay, John, forget what I said.
The people you should never pick up are handicapped persons.
The reason is, in the time it takes you to help one of them in and out of your cab, you could pick up maybe ten guys who could get in and out all by themselves.
So, no handicapped persons.
Cabs are only for people who can walk.
You have to forgive Louie.
He's himself today.
Hey, great news!
I just called the gym.
They want me to spar with Carlos Navarone.
The champ?
Oh, wow!
Imagine, the champ hitting my face.
Wow, hey, this is real.
I've never seen anything like this before.
* Down in the valley * Where the green grass grows * * There sat Elaine, pretty as a * Hey, it was just a joke, you know.
I was just being silly.
Hey, come on.
Haven't you ever felt like being silly?
Well, good luck on your career.
I don't know, I still think we went a little bit overboard with the present.
I mean, uh, what's the big deal here?
It's a big deal to Tony.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
I Well, at least it was smart getting him a robe, huh?
He can wear it when he's fighting and when he's convalescing.
Hey, here's our man now.
Hey, Tony!
Tony!
Tony!
Hey, Tony!
Gee, it's great to see you guys.
Uh, listen, Tony, we got you something to commemorate the occasion.
It's from everybody down at the garage except for, uh, Louie, Vince, Charlie, and Ed.
They refused to cough up.
Aw, man.
My name, too!
Oh, it's okay.
You know, I was going to put, like, "Killer Banta," "Tiger Banta" No, no, I found it's best not to wear a robe that makes your opponent crazy.
Well, come on, try it on.
Yeah.
I'll help you.
Ooh, ooh.
Ooh, turn around.
Beautiful!
Beautiful.
Oh, man.
Feels good, huh?
You know, I never had a robe before, of my own.
I'd go in with just a towel wrapped around my neck.
Once, the announcer said: "In this corner, Holiday Inn".
I guess what I'm trying to say is thanks.
Aw, well.
Mr. Banta.
Here.
Oh Jerry Martin.
Oh, sure, I read about you in the papers, Mr. Martin.
Hey, this is the champ's manager and these are my friends.
Elaine Nardo.
Hi, How do you do?
Jerry Martin.
And Alex Rieger.
Hi.
Jerry Martin.
And Bobby Wheeler.
Jerry Martin.
Hi.
How you doing, man?
Look, what's your name, son?
Anthony Mark Banta.
I see.
And, uh, what do your friends call you, son?
Tony.
What would you like me to call you, son?
I like "son".
Well, you'll be going next and today, we're using the 16-ounce glove.
Let me help you with those.
You'll be going three rounds with Carlos and I'd like you to concentrate, if you will, on the body.
We're trying to toughen the midsection.
That's fine, but I think I better warn you.
I've got a pretty good left hand.
Do you?
Well, you know, I just didn't want to surprise him with it.
I'm going to let him know.
I still can't believe it.
Me in the same ring with Carlos Navarone.
His last fight, I couldn't get in the same stadium.
Hey, what about your headgear?
Hey, man, I'm a pro.
I've fought dozens of times.
You know, what do I need to, uh We all wear them.
Son!
Son!
He's calling you over there.
Son!
Oh, yeah, Jerry.
Okay, see you.
Yeah.
Go ahead, Tony.
Have a good time, huh?
Now listen, I want to see you really work on the inside.
Keep banging away at that midsection.
Remember, we got less than a week, so let's really pull out the stops.
Hey, Alex, could you help me with this robe?
Oh, yeah.
Go!
No.
Not yet.
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Try it from the gloves.
Try it from right Let me do it!
I told you to get big sleeves.
All the ones with big sleeves had Japanese paintings on them.
Excuse me, can I try something?
Oh This is humiliating.
Okay, get going.
Okay.
Come on, Tony.
You look good.
Hit another left.
Come on, Tony!
All right!
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
Come on, Tony.
Come on!
Inside!

Inside!
No, oh-oh!
He looks pretty good in there, huh?
Yeah!
Almost not embarrassing.
Hey, you know, I bet you it's like who you're in there with, you know?
I mean, like, like, when I act with a real pro, I get better.
Yeah, it's the same with tennis.
When I play with an "A" player, I get better.
Yeah, it's the same with sex.
You get better?
They do.
All right, son.
Go for the body.
The body.
Did you see that?
He knocked him down!
Champ, I'm sorry I hit you so hard.
It's all right, kid.
Forget it.
Latka!
Cheer down.

Louie!
Louie!

Always remember, lust is better than love.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Okay.
Hey, Latka, how's it going?
I in lust.
What else is new?
Ooh, Nardo!
You had a good night.
I had you pegged for a washout.
So sorry to disappoint you.
I don't know what's going on.
Women cabbies booking a lot.
A bum fighter gets a fight with a major contender just because he gets in one lucky punch.
The world's gone crazy.
I think it's the spray cans.
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen: pound for pound, the greatest fighter I know personally-- Tony "One Punch" Banta!
All right, All right.
No dancing in the garage.
Hey, how you feel, Tony?
Oh, I feel great.
Man, this is the biggest week of my life.
You know what I'm going to do?
What?
Buy a new cup.
You sure know how to celebrate.
Hey, Tony, this Frankie Wallace-- I hear he's pretty good.
You know how good he is?
I looked up his record.
And?
He's so good you can look up his record.
You know, Ring Magazine's got him eighth in the world.
I'm not even eighth in the gym.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, who got the big fight?
Me.
Who's getting paid 1,500 bucks?
Me.
Who floored the champ?
Me.
Well?
I got a shot.
Baloney.
Once a bum, always a bum.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
I say Tony's got a good chance.
I know he's got a good chance.
I say he can win.
Want to bet?
Well, uh   All right, I'll bet.
How much?
Five dollars.
Whoo, Mr. Big Booker bets five whole dollars on his friend who he's sure is going to win.
All right, all right, a hundred bucks.
Money in the bank.
I hope you're going to be at the fight, Louie.
I'd like to collect on the spot.
You're going to give up a Friday night-- the busiest night of the week-- to go watch the macaroni pony fight?
Yeah, and you know what?
Everybody from the garage is going to be there.
You think for friendship they're going to do that?
Not where the old pocketbook's involved.
Tomorrow night, I'll be up to my ears in drivers as per usual.
All right, Belson, I know you're hiding.
Come on out, Cohen.
Let's hit the streets.
All right, Beniquez, in the cab.
Let's go.
Nobody.
I was sure someone would show.
Latka!
Is anybody here?
Is anybody here?
Nobody's here.
Nobody's here.
* From this moment on * You and I, babe * We'll be riding high, babe * Every care is gone Come on, take it home now!
* From this Hip, hip, hip!
* Moment on.
Yeah!
Always wanted to do that.
You know, Alex, I still can't believe I'm here.
Ever since I'm 14, not a day goes by I don't spend three hours in the gym.
Yeah?
I thought I'd win the Golden Gloves.
Yeah?
I didn't.
I thought I'd win the Olympics.
I didn't.
I didn't even see the Olympics.
My set blew out.
You ever try to listen to the Olympics on the radio?
Ah, but it doesn't matter.
It's all okay, 'cause it got me here today.
Hey, how did it happen?
I guess it's destiny, huh?
Well, personally, I think it's my management.
Boy, this is a bigger fight than I thought.
The Bee Gees are singing the National Anthem.
No kidding?
Oh, you son of a gun.
Isn't he something?
You win this fight, you're never going to have to drive a cab again.
You're gonna be the first one to make it out of the garage.
Aw, I can't be the first one.
Paulie made it.
I'm not sure that shingling houses with your father-in-law counts for making it.
Get ready, Banta.
There's a guy in there bleeding like a pig.
I think they're going to stop it.
You know, I like the theater better.
They just say "five minutes".
Hey, uh good luck.
Thanks, Bob.
It's okay, Tone.
Hey, Champ, you came.
Yeah, I just wanted to wish you good luck.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, Mr. Martin, how are you?
How you doing?
I see you still got that great robe.
Oh, yeah.
Those are nice vents you got there.
Hey, hey, and don't worry about your title.
I won't be ready for a couple years yet, but when I am, look out.
Right, and, uh, hey, listen, thanks.
For what?
You know, that little trick in the gym.
What do you mean?
Hey, didn't he know?
I guess it's okay to tell him now.
It's real simple, kid.
We were taking in less money than we should because Carlos is considered unbeatable.
So having him sit down when you punched him during the sparring match helped us out.
Hey, run that by me again.
You didn't knock down the champ.
I don't believe you.
I hit you good.
You're just trying to cover up with some crummy story 'cause you don't like being knocked down by somebody with no record.
Yeah, I think we made a mistake.
I don't believe it!
I hit you good!
With what?
A left hook to the body.
I'll show you.
Hit me.
If I hit you, you'll go down like you did in the gym.
Come on, hit me.
You keep it up, and I will.
You're sure you don't mind?
Man, what a dirty trick, building me up like that.
Man, I'm going to teach this guy a lesson.
You only get one for free.
No, Tony, Tony, Tony.
Now, Mr. Navarone, you have no idea how frightened I am right now.
Hey, Tony, I can't even hold him.
Look, now, why don't you just laugh this off, huh?
Let him go!
I'll let him go.
Go ahead.
You crazy, Tony?
Yeah!
Okay, Banta, your turn to fight.
What's wrong with him?
Hey, don't you know enough not to interrupt a man at prayer?
Hey, you all right?
Hey, would you give me a hand with him?
Sure.
You think you'll be able to go ahead with the fight?
I think I'll be all right if I could just stay away from him for the first couple of rounds.
Yeah.
Hey, but don't say anything.
Oh, no, I won't.
Hey, who are you, anyway?
Your opponent.
Nice to meet you.
What's your name?
Tony Banta.
How many fingers am I holding up?
Stick to the easy ones.
I came late.
What happened?
I lost.
I know.
I saw every minute.
Here's your Ah, come on, are you kidding?
I was rooting for him myself.
Come on, I lost, I want to pay up.
Come on, are you kidding?
We're from the same garage.
This is the last time I'm going to offer you.
Gimme.
Well, maybe I won't be the first guy to make it out of the garage but I'm going to make it.
I'm going to get a rematch with this guy and I'm going to be right back here fighting.
And I'm going to be right back here managing you.
And I'm going to be here rooting for you.
And I'm going to be here.
And I'm going to be here.
And I'm going to be here-- making a fortune.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Everybody sing.
Hey, Bobby Hey.
How come you look so happy?
You know, this really strange thing happened to me last night.
I called you up to see if you wanted to go out for a beer or something and you weren't home.
Right.
I talked to this girl on your answering service Named Angela.
Oh, she's terrific.
My favorite operator.
You know, I call for my messages, and all the rest of them they just say, "Still nothing".
You know, an actor doesn't like to hear that but Angela-- nobody called me-- she gives me other people's messages.
Yeah, yeah, she really seemed nice on the phone, you know?
Oh, unbelievably nice.
Hey, Rieger?
Sometimes she gives me Gene Shalit's messages.
Really?
Yeah.
Gene and me we use the same service, you know.
A lot of stars call him.
You know who called him yesterday?
Who?
Erma Bombeck.
Hey, you ever been out with Angela, Bobby?
Angela?
From your answering service?
Oh, she's a peach.
One night she and I discussed my boxing career.
You know, we never even met and still we must have talked for around five minutes.
That's longer than most of your fights last.
Yeah.
We talked for a while too.
Over an hour.
Wow, an hour?
Hold it.
You tied up my line for an hour?
Alex, I could be getting acting jobs during that time.
I sort of forgot about the time.
I mean she was so terrific on the phone.
Hey, how come you never thought about asking her out?
Well, I almost asked her out once but I decided against it, it wasn't worth the risk.
What risk?
She might turn out to be a dog.
Oh.
Geez.
Did you just geez at me, Elaine?
I can't believe you.
I mean you wouldn't go out with a woman if she wasn't good looking?
Sure, I would.
If I was real drunk or something.
Hey come on, Elaine.
Looks matter to women too.
How popular are short, pudgy, ugly men?
Yeah.
How popular, Louie?
You know, Bobby I hope someone slams a door on your nose and you sneeze and your head explodes.
If you had such a good conversation with her, Alex why don't you ask her out?
Well, I'm thinking about it.
Yeah, well, I got to call for my messages.
Hey, if Angela should happen to answer should I No.
All right, whatever, but you better move fast.
Why?
So you can tell me what she's like.
Hi.
Any for Wheeler, 131?
Anything for Shalit?
Hey, Angela, how'd you like talking to my friend, Alex?
Oh, yeah.
He's even better than he sounds.
Sure.
I'll describe him to you.
Before Bobby gets cute, I, uh Oh, this is Alex.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I remember your voice, too even though I knew it was you.
I mean, even if I didn't know it was you and I heard your voice, I would know it was you.
You want to go out with me?
Smooth, Alex.
Would you get out of here?
Oh, boy.
What, "Oh, boy"?
What you got there, Latka?
Okay, okay, Latka.
Shh!
Slow down, okay?
Slow down.
Okay.
You found it on the back seat.
Yeah.
Not smackers.
Bucks.
Latka, you found the 2,000 bucks I've been looking for.
Hey, you never lost I didn't say I lost it.
I just said I was looking for it.
I've been looking for 2,000 bucks all my life.
Hands off, Louie.
Hey, Louie it's your mother calling.
She says somebody's trying to break into her apartment.
Tell her I'll get back to her.
That's your mother.
All right.
I'll talk to her now.
Don't do nothing with that money while I'm gone.
Listen, somebody has to bring this up.
The hack rules say that this money must be returned to the police precinct.
No police.
Oh, it's okay, if we turn it in and nobody claims it within 90 days then it's returned to us, free and clear.
No police, no police, no nothing.
Just money.
You know, it's probably dirty money, right?
I mean what kind of decent person walks around with 2,000 bucks in cash, right?
A priest who collected it for underprivileged crippled children.
Or a nun on her way to send it to starving natives.
Or a hooker.
Hey, Alex, listen, we got a little problem.
Latka just found this bunch of money  Oh, it gets better every time he tells it.
Anyway, we're trying to decide what to do.
Yeah?
Good.
I got to leave.
I got a date.
With Angela?
Uh-huh.
Hey, way to go.
I never worked so hard for a date in my life.
Hey, where you taking her?
Well, I thought I'd take her to dinner, uh, Mario's.
It's a nice place, but stay away from the clams oreganata with eggplant.
It killed my sister-in-law.
Have a good time, Alex.
Doesn't get any better.
Hi.
I'm Alex.
You blew it.
You could have said you were looking for another apartment.
No.
I was looking for this one, 3-D.
It fell off when I knocked on door.
Well, my admirers will just have to wander the halls looking for me.
I hate to disappoint you, but I'm Angela.
Oh.
Here's your "D".
You want to come in?
Huh?
Yeah.
Sure.
You got guts.
It's very nice.
You're doing very well.
Huh?
The smile, I mean.
Most guys drop it ten seconds after they see me.
You can stop now.
You've got the record.
Say so, Angela This is really very nice.
Do you want to use the phone?
What for?
To call your mother.
Maybe you'll be lucky and she'll be sick and you'll have to run over and see her.
That's some sense of humor you got there, Angela.
Well, listen, our dinner reservations aren't for about an hour so you want to get something first somewhere else-- a drink or something?
You must know a really dark bar where no one will see us.
We don't have to go anywhere if you don't want to.
We can have a drink here.
Sure, why take any chance on anyone seeing you with me.
What would you like to drink?
What do you got?
Malteds.
Listen, we can get something at the restaurant.
Hope you like Italian.
Doesn't matter.
As you can see, I eat anything.
If you want, I could fix you something here.
You don't want to go out?
I don't care.
I was just trying to make it easy on you.
Get your coat.
What are you trying to prove?
That you're a great guy?
Okay.
You're a great guy.
A real prince.
Um here.
Here's your coat.
You don't know when to quit, do you?
Hey, I asked you out for dinner, we're going out for dinner.
It will be fun.
You'll see.
Fat chance.
Do you like clams oreganata with eggplant?
I never met anybody who liked anchovies.
Rich people probably like them.
Rich people like anything that's small that tastes weird.
Why don't you drop the act now, huh?
What?
What act?
Pretending that you're not having a lousy time.
Hey, come on, Angela, would you?
What do you still got your coat on for?
The management requested it.
Don't you care for your salad?
I wouldn't know if I cared for it or not.
I didn't eat it.
Hey, what's with you?
What's the matter?
Aren't you having a good time anymore?
I once went out with a girl who pulled a knife on me, robbed me and threw me out of her car on the New Jersey turnpike.
I have to think about that now as a medium date.
So you want to take me home now?
Yeah, I'd be happy to.
There he is.
Let's go out this way.
Hey, Alex, I'm really sorry.
I tried to stop them from coming down and bothering you.
Angela Matusa this is Tony Banta, John Burns, Latka Gravas and Bobby Wheeler, who I guess you sort of know.
Nice to finally meet you, Angela.
Am I what you pictured, Bobby?
Yeah, more or less.
More.
What are you guys doing here?
If you'll excuse me.
I have to use the ladies' room.
Hey, Alex So how's your big date?
All right, stop that.
That's not funny.
Hey.
I think Latka likes her.
Do you like her, Latka?
Maybe Alex will give you her number.
You could call her up for tomorrow night.
Oh, no.
Thank you very much.
All right, what do you clowns want?
Yeah.
Why don't you sit down?
Well, you know the money that Latka found?
We're still trying to decide what to do with it.
We wanted you to hold onto it until we figure out what to do with it, all right?
Yeah, because otherwise we're going to have to spend the night as a group 'cause nobody trusts nobody.
Except you.
Everybody trusts you.
Okay.
Want to give us a receipt?
Oh, here comes Angela.
Now be polite, huh?
Control yourself.
Oh, hi.
Good to see you back.
Everything go all right in the ladies' room?
We should be going now.
Nice meeting you, Angela.
See you.
Yeah, so long.
Bet your friends got quite a kick out of me, huh?
What do you mean?
I heard them all break up when I left.
They weren't laughing at you.
No?
No.
One of the guys told a joke.
Why are you afraid to tell me they were laughing at me?
I can take it.
Because they weren't.
Now can we drop this?
All I know is, I heard a big laugh when I left the table.
I told you what it was.
What do you want from me?
I want you to stop lying to me.
You've been lying to me all night, and I'm sick of it.
Okay.
They were laughing at you, okay?
You could have held out.
I was almost ready to believe you.
Look, you don't have to bother seeing me home.
No, I'll take you.
No, really.
I'm one of the few women in New York who's safe on the streets.
Come on, you came with me, you're leaving with me.
Listen, let's not spoil a lovely evening by arguing, okay?
And hey, don't worry.
You did your duty.
You proved you were a nice guy.
I'm taking you.
Get your paws off me.
They give you a little dinner, they think they own you.
Latka!
Will you cut it out?
!
You're not going to find any more money.
Besides, these cabs got to go out soon but they can't go out with no back seats 'cause where will our passengers sit?
You want them to squat on the floor like ducks?
Okay.
Put the damn seats back you dumb foreigner.
Come on!
Foreigner?
Yeah.
Did you said foreigner?
Yeah.
For you.
What's that mean?
Means this.
You better smile when you do that, buddy.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, pal, mull this one over.
Oh, all right.
I accept your apology.
But we still don't know who was driving when the money was left in it.
Hi, Alex.
Hey, Alex, did you score?
Shut up.
I guess not.
Geez.
I heard about your date.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I wonder how come?
You get some real kooks on blind dates, boy.
Like this one.
I show up-- looking good, per usual-- and this girl comes to the door.
Beautiful.
Not your type.
Right, 'cause to be honest I prefer my women "H and H"-- homely and hot.
I misjudged you, Louie.
You're really a poet, you know?
You bet.
Can I have my receipt, please?
Anyway, all of a sudden, she says, "I feel sick".
Tells me she thinks she was exposed to cholera earlier that day.
So, what did you do?
I tried to take her blouse off.
It's not my fault she feels sick so why shouldn't one of us have a good time, right?
You know, every time I talk to you, Louie I feel grateful that I haven't eaten yet.
Heard about your date.
Oh, yeah, what was it, broadcast over the PA?
Yeah.
Hey, Elaine, can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah, sure.
I don't want any advice.
I just want to talk.
Go ahead.
I can't stop thinking about that girl.
You know, you're a terrific guy.
That's not what I want to hear.
It just goes to show you how terrific you are.
All night long, she kept accusing me of going through the motions-- that I wouldn't call her again because of her looks and I kept telling her she was wrong.
Terrific.
But she wasn't wrong.
Oh, Alex, you too?
No.
Listen, what I can't figure out is that hour I had with her on the phone was one of the greatest conversations I've ever had.
A witty, bright, sensitive girl who came to the door disappeared.
What happened to her?
Maybe Angela ate her.
It wasn't just her looks.
She was also the bitterest, surliest most depressing person I ever met.
So, how come I feel like I have to go see her again?
I don't know.
You got an answer for that?
Yeah, I feel like I'm walking away from a car wreck with a person trapped inside.
That's true.
I'm going to go see her.
Oh, before I forget you can give us that money back now.
Even though we're nowhere near figuring out how to split it.
Hey, listen, Latka found it.
Why don't you give it all to him?
That's one we didn't think of.
What are you talking about?
He doesn't know what to do with that kind of money.
Yeah, he'll probably just blow it on rent or food or something.
How can you give it to him?
You want to pop the veins in my head?
Here, Latka, take your money.
Okay, you guys.
Thank you very much.
Hey, no, no.
Latka, Latka, please.
Please, not now.
Let's make it seven out of 13.
What are you doing this time praying nobody will be home?
Huh?
No.
Listen, I just dropped by because I, I Come in if you want.
Okay.
I guess I should have called first, but, uh Hey, is this our second date?
I don't know.
Let's say it is.
I've never had one.
Okay, it's our second date.
Good, so far it looks like I haven't been missing anything.
Hey, Angela?
Will you just let me get out what I have to say?
Because I don't want to end up with us doing that stupid stuff that we did last night.
You mean falling in love?
Would you like to hear what I have to say or not?
Can I get a drink first?
I have a feeling I'm going to need a drink.
Yeah, go ahead.
You want anything?
No, thanks.
So, what's on your mind?
Well, I, uh I don't really know.
I, uh I guess I would sort of like to get to know you better.
Why?
Why not?
Well, you might not know to look at me but I'm not exactly beautiful, or, uh, even good-looking.
I'm not quite plain.
Now, feel free to jump in and stop me anytime.
Hey, come on.
I'm no Robert Redford, you know.
I wouldn't mind looking like you if I was a man.
Would you want to look like me?
Wouldn't be so bad.
I'd, you know, kind of fix up my hair and, uh I'd do that sort of stuff with makeup and, uh, I'd go to a gym, and I'd work on myself.
I mean, that's what I would do.
Not that I'm saying that you should do anything.
It's just what I would do.
Okay, let's say I did all the hairdo and makeup and everything and dropped ten or 70 pounds.
Do you think I'd be attractive?
Do you think I'd be attractive?
Yeah, sure, why not?
In a romantic sort of way?
You don't have to answer.
You could just nod.
Hey, look, I'm not, uh I haven't been romantically involved in eight years and I'm not about to break my streak right now.
Hey, look, but we, uh we did have fun talking on the phone the other day, didn't we?
I mean, that was sort of special.
Hey, look, I swear I'm not that comfortable with that many people.
I just think that we could get to be friends.
I can't believe you came all the way back here just because you forgot to give me the "let's be friends" speech.
Hey, can we drop that?
I just think I'd like to get to know you better, that's all.
You want me to open up?
Would that make you happy?
Make you feel like you did your good deed for the day?
Okay.
Okay.
But then you better plan on sticking around.
Because I'm not standing here alone with my insides on the floor, while you walk out feeling you did the poor fat girl some big favor by helping her get in touch with her feelings.
You want to be a hero?
Then be prepared to stick around for the rest of the war, okay?
Maybe I will.
But can we start slower-- like where we went to high school and then we'll work up to your insides on the floor?
Hey, Angela, I think we had a normal moment there.
Huh?
Well, listen, uh, you don't mind if I get a little clear on what we're trying to establish here.
It wouldn't make you nuts, would it?
No, it would not make me nuts.
So, uh so, what it is, is, is I could call you whenever I feel like it?
If I need advice, I could call you?
Yeah.
Uh if you need advice, you could call me?
Yup.
If we have something interesting happening we could call each other?
Yeah.
We could call just to shoot the breeze?
Yeah.
Yup.
Or, uh if I just need a hug?
Uh, you know how long it's been since I cried?
No.
A half an hour.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Yo!
Cab!
Taxi!
Where to?
Oh, right.
Do you mind the dog being in the cab, do you?
No.
He doesn't mind me being in it, does he?
Don't worry about him.
He's very well trained.
He just got out of obedience school.
I take him everywhere with me.
I just won him in a poker game a few weeks back.
It's a beautiful dog, isn't he?
Yeah, he sure is beautiful.
Name is Hamlet.
You can probably guess why I call him Hamlet.
Grew up in a small town?
No.
Because he's a Great Dane.
You know, Hamlet, the Dane in the play.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very intelligent dog, too.
Watch, I'll show you.
Speak, Hamlet.
Speak.
Come on, Hamlet, speak.
Come on, Hamlet, speak.
"O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I"!
Come on, Hamlet, speak, you stupid dog.
Come on, speak!
That's okay.
If he thinks of something to say later on he can call me.
Uh, it's a buck 65.
There you go.
Ah, that's all right.
Thank you.
You know, he really is a very smart dog.
I don't know what's wrong with him today.
Hold out your hand, he'll give you his paw.
Uh, no, I don't think I better.
No, no, no.
Come on, hold out your hand, he'll give you his paw.
Give him your paw, Ham.
I said paw, not floor.
Ah, that's okay.
No, it isn't okay.
Get up from there, you stupid dog.
Come on, get up from there!
Hey, that's o Hey, mister, what are you doing?
Get up from there.
Well, he's got to learn.
Hey, what are Get up from there.
Hey, don't hit the dog.
You-- It's my dog.
I'll hit him if I want to.
Get up from there you stupid dog.
Come on, it's my cab.
Don't hit the dog in my cab.
I said, get up from there!
Hey, mister, you hear what I said?
When I tell you to get up Will you cut it out?
get up from there.
Hey, mister, will you cut that out?
Get up from there, you stupid dog.
Hey, give me that.
Give me that.
What?
Get out of my cab.
Go on.
Get out of here.
All right.
Come on, Hamlet.
Hamlet, come out here!
Come!
Hey, you got my dog in there!
Hi.
It's Bobby Wheeler.
Any messages?
Well, a-are you sure?
Yeah, okay, well, just check again, all right?
O-okay.
Now, listen.
I'm down at the garage.
If anybody calls, you give them the number.
All right.
Hey, what are you doing, man?
Let me go, Tony.
I got to hit something.
Hey, what are you crazy?
I can see you're upset, but, uh, don't hit that.
You could really hurt yourself.
Yeah, well, I don't care, man, 'cause I got to hit something.
All right, all right.
Here.
Hit me.
Here, in the stomach.
Go ahead.
I can't do that.
Come on, don't worry about it.
I'm hard as a rock.
I do 200 sit-ups a day.
I go to the gym, guys hit me all the time.
It's part of my training.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
You're sure now, right?
Go ahead.
Hard as you can.
Go ahead.
Oh, Tony!
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Hey, listen, if it makes you feel any better, I feel great.
Great.
Anytime I can help.
I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry, Tony.
Hey, hey, John?
John, don't use that phone, okay?
John, I said don't use that phone!
Hey, Bob.
Is it all right if John uses the toilet?
Just lay off, Louie, okay?
I got a lot of things on my mind.
Hi, boys.
Hi, Alex.
Hi.
Hey, listen, um, could you do me a favor?
Yeah?
I'm expecting a call any minute, you know.
And could you wait with me?
'Cause I don't want to be alone when I get it.
Yeah, sure.
What kind of phone call?
Well, you see  Alex.
Yo.
I find I find in your cab.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, my gosh.
Look at him.
Wow.
Where'd you find him?
I took him away from some guy in my cab.
He was whipping him with his leash.
Hey, you shouldn't do that, boy.
You could hurt somebody.
Not him.
Hey, Alex He's so gorgeous.
What's his name?
Alex, you see, this phone call His name is Hamlet.
Are you going to him?
Well, I guess so.
Till I can find a better home for him.
Hey, Latka, will you do me a favor and get Hamlet some water?
Come on.
Oh, I'm sorry, Bobby.
Uh, you were telling me about this phone call.
Yeah, it Hey, so what's doing here?
Are we getting breakfast or what?
Hey, what's this phone call you're waiting for?
It's about an acting job.
Oh Yeah, I'm up for the lead in an off-broadway play.
That's something.
All right!
Yeah, but the thing is it's down between me and two other guys and they said they'd let me know this morning.
So Stuff like that's always happening to you.
This is special?
Yeah.
See, that's why I wanted to talk to you, Alex.
I've got this whole thing like, I All right, all right.
Everybody sit down.
I'll tell you See, when I first came to New York Where did you come from, Bobby?
The Bronx.
I made this deal with myself.
I mean, I knew how there were thousands of starving actors here and how it's a rotten life and how very few make it and how you can get old trying, you know?
So I gave myself a strict time limit.
Three years.
Three years to get started as an actor.
Now, I promised myself, if in that amount of time if I didn't get a paid acting job I'd give it up, get a regular full-time job and never think about acting again.
I mean a guy can't go on like I've been doing forever.
You know, beating my brains out here six nights a week.
Spending my days trying out for something that might not happen.
I mean, there's got to be a limit.
I figured three years.
I mean, how could I not get a job in three years, you know?
Three years are up today.
I mean, my life is riding on this job, you know?
I got to get this part, Alex.
You see, that's-that's why I wanted you to be with me.
Yeah, I know.
Well, listen 'Cause you know how much I want to act.
It's the only thing in the world that that really matters to me.
Yeah, I know I mean, if they call up and they tell me that they're gonna pick one of those other guys, Alex, I don't know what I'm going to do.
W-What are you going to do?
So, they pick another guy.
I mean, It's not the world, is it?
All right, I want my dog.
Where's my dog?
I'll right back to you, Bobby.
I got to deal with this guy first.
Come on, where is he?
Hamlet?
!
Hamlet?
!
Oh, there he is.
Would you give me that dog, please?
What dog?
Well, that dog.
That's my dog.
I don't see any dog.
What dog are you talking about?
Yeah, I don't see any dog either.
Dog?
What dog?
Hey, Fred, do you see a dog?
What dog?
There isn't any dog here.
Oh, I get it.
You guys are looking for trouble, huh?
Hey!
What's going on out here?
Are you in charge here?
Do old ladies get mugged?
Well, that dog is my dog, and I want him now.
Hey, Louie, we don't know what this guy's talking about.
You don't see no dog here, do ya?
Uh yeah I got something in my eyes.
I can't see anything.
I can't see if there's a dog here or not.
Anybody got a dollar bill I could wipe the sweat out of my eyes?
Here, Louie.
There's no dog here, mister.
You guys think you're pretty cute, don't you?
Well, you'd better give me that dog and you'd better give him to me right now, because if you don't, I'm going straight from here to the police.
Oh Now, does anybody want to talk to me about that or not?
Sure, you want somebody to talk to you?
Yeah.
Latka.
Hi.
Go, Latka!
Hi.
Yeah, yeah.
This is Bobby Wheeler.
Uh, no, uh that's okay, you know.
Right.
I-I-I, uh I appreciate the call, really.
I didn't get the part, Hamlet.
Here are my bookings, Louie.
That's a good Hamlet.
That's good, Hamlet.
Hey, Louie Louie for God's sake, man, it's my turn.
Let me have him, huh?
All right, All right.
I'll let you have him, but only 'cause your dreams are crashing around you.
Thanks.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Yeah.
Hey, Bobby, listen, don't worry about it.
Everything's going to be okay.
Will you stop talking to him like that, Elaine?
How is everything be okay?
Look, I don't know much about acting, but what I do know is, if you want a good job you got to go stand in line.
If you want to find a good job acting, find a line to stand in.
Bobby, you're not going to get anywhere sitting here feeling sorry for yourself.
Damn it, Alex, you're right.
There's still 14 hours to go before midnight.
I'm gonna knock on every door in New York if I have to.
I don't care what it is-- bit part, commercial, walk-on-- but I'm going to get something.
Hi, Tom.
Hi, Bobby.
Oh, gee, thanks a lot.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.
Really.
Oh, don't mention it.
Now, it's just a lucky thing that you happened to come by today.
Yeah.
Now, look, Bobby, you do understand that the director is doing the casting on the commercial.
I can't influence him for you.
Yeah, of course, but, you know, any tips on how I might be able to catch his eye?
Just, uh, be yourself.
I better go rehearse a little.
Okay.
Tom?
Tom, okay, I'm ready.
Everybody, everybody, this is Peter Nicholson our director.
Thank you.
Okay, now, I'm sure you're all familiar with this commercial.
I'd like Tom over here.
Yeah.
And I'd like you all to form a loose semicircle behind him with your backs towards him, please.
Okay?
Now I will cue Tom and I want you to react naturally for me, okay?
And Tom.
"My broker is EF Hutton, and EF Hutton says "  Great!
Okay, thank you.
We'll be in touch.
Thank you.
Uh Tom, h-how did I do?
You did fine, just fine, Bobby, really.
You, uh, think I got a shot?
Yeah, you got a shot!
Gees, thanks, Tom.
I'll be right there in a minute.
I'll be right there, right there.
All right, coming, coming.
Hey, come on in.
Hey, did you get the commercial?
Hey, did you get your commercial?
Just wait a minute.
Are you going to tell us or not?
Well, wait till everybody's inside.
Did you get it?
I didn't get it!
What?
What?
So what are we celebrating, then?
Oh.
Well My first acting job.
Oh You got your first acting job?
Not yet!
Yay!
Yay!
Yay!
What?
What is this, some kind of a new party game here?
Hey, it's okay that I didn't get a job, because I'm going to get one.
Wait a minute.
Are you sure?
Oh, positive.
And it's gonna be before midnight tonight.
Come on, I'll tell you all about it.
Let's everybody have a drink.
Yeah, let's have a drink.
Hey, Latka, come on.
Let's go.
Come on, come on.
Okay, all right, somebody make a toast and we're set.
Okay, um Toast, toast.
Eh  No, no.
Everybody must do toast.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
Latka, if you don't mind, I'll make the toast.
To Bobby's new job.
Hear, hear.
Ni-nice toast.
Okay, come on, come on.
Everybody, sit down.
Yeah, come on.
Okay.
Well, Bobby, why don't you just tell us about the job you're going to get.
Oh, well When I found out I didn't get the commercial this morning I really started hustling.
I went into every casting office in this town.
Some guys even had me read for parts, you know?
And that's pretty good when you're going in cold, you know.
Yeah, I'll say.
Who am I kidding?
That's great when you're going in cold!
And some of them even told me that I was in the running.
So one of them should come through, right?
Sure.
I'm gonna get a call on my phone before midnight tonight when the three years are up, and I'm not going to have to give up acting.
Oh, you know, it's just so great when you know it in your heart, man.
You don't have to sweat it anymore.
Well, maybe somebody is going to call you, Bobby, but how do you know they're gonna call before midnight?
Well, that's simple logic.
You see, when you're good at something you end up doing it.
Now, I'm not going to end up acting unless I get a phone call before midnight.
So I'm gonna get a call before midnight.
Isn't it wonderful?
I mean, so what if he doesn't get a call tonight?
He's feeling really great right now.
Yeah.
So what if you're falling off the cliff?
The view is wonderful on the way down.
What does that mean?
Somebody better tell this guy that he's setting himself up for too big a fall.
Alex, don't.
Sure.
We all leave here at 11:59 with a song in our heart, and hope we don't hear the thud.
I just don't think it's appropriate right now.
Hey, uh, what are you guys talking about?
Nothing.
Alex is just getting a little nervous.
Now come on, Elaine.
I got to tell him what I'm thinking.
I'm his friend.
Hey, don't worry, Alex.
I just explained to you why I'm gonna get the call before midnight, right?
Yeah, yeah, I know-- because you're so good at acting.
Exactly.
Great actors get jobs.
I'm a great actor.
Bobby, we got to be rational here.
I am being rational.
I'm good.
Good people do what they're good at and I'm good.
Bobby I got to act, Alex, because I'm good.
Bobby, listen I'm good!
Look, just because someone doesn't call you by midnight doesn't mean The only way that phone's not gonna ring before midnight, Alex, is if I'm not good enough.
And you're not going to tell me Maybe you're not that good.
Yet.
Doesn't mean that with a little more experience, you couldn't get there.
All right, Just stop it.
All right?
Now you've said what you had to say.
Now let me talk, all right?
Well When I was six years old, Alex my father died, and I never had any older brothers.
Had a couple of older sisters, but, uh till I met you I don't think there was ever a man in my life that I felt was on my side.
I mean, I had lots of friends and everything, but I always felt there was something special between you and me.
And you knew that, Alex.
You knew how I how I looked up to you and respected you, and counted on you.
Oh, come on, Bobby Please, just let me finish all right?
What you just said just now-- I mean, it would have been okay coming from a friend, but not from somebody I felt about the way I feel about you.
I don't know how to tell you, I you just hurt me now, Alex Except to say that it feels like, uh like my father just died again.
Oh, come on, Bobby.
No, it's a little late for that, man.
I needed you and you let me down.
I needed you, Alex.
Bobby, Alex is only trying to You stay out of this, Elaine!
It's between Alex and me.
There's only one thing that I want from you right now, Alex.
And that's for you to get out of here.
: I don't want to see you again.
I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to know you, man!
Bobby All right, come on, all right?
Just get out, all right?
!
Just get the hell out of here!
You still say I'm not such a good actor?
Hey, that was something.
You bastard.
Now, baby, ring.
Come on, ring.
Blap.
Blap.
It's two minutes to 12:00, Bobby.
Yeah, I know what time it is, Elaine, but please stop telling me what time it is.
I mean, it's going to ring before midnight and then that's that, you know?
I haven't said this yet, but it's going to ring.
Okay, now hold it down because it's, like, only 40 seconds left.
It's going to ring.
I just know it.
It's going to ring.
Maybe your watch is off.
No.
It has to be by my watch.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Zero.
Zero.
Zero.
I-I promised myself that I'd quit acting and get a job in three years.
Well, it's it's been three years.
Aw, what the hell.
I'll give myself another three years.
There he is.
That's my dog.
Excuse me.
Hamlet, come over here.
I'll teach you to growl at me.
Wait till I get you home!
Officer, where is this insane man going with my dog?
Your dog?
See, he admits it.
Officer, this is my dog and I'm taking him.
Officer, this is my dog and he's not going anywhere.
Why don't you just stand them at a distance and let them call the dog?
Whichever one he goes to gets the dog, right?
This guy ought to run for borough president.
All right, Officer, where do I stand?
You stand over there.
Fine.
Where do I stand?
And you stand over there.
Sit, boy.
Now, when I say so, I want you both to call the dog's name.
And whichever one he goes to, that's the dog's owner, and that's that, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, one second.
Huh?
What was that all about?
I just want to make sure no one's carrying any meat.
Okay, call the dog.
Hamlet.
Hamlet.
Hamlet.
Hamlet, come here.
Come over here, Hamlet.
Come on, Hamlet.
Hamlet.
Hamlet.
Hamlet, come over here.
Come over here!
Hamlet, come over here!
Come over here!
Wait till I get you.
Come over here.
You come over here!
Come over here when I tell you.
Come over here.
Well, I guess that's that.
Hey, man, why would he do that?
Go with the guy that beats him?
It's his dog!
It's his dog!
It's his dog!
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
It's okay, I guess.
Why am I being modest?
I'm alone.
It's perfect.
Metropolitan Museum.
I bet you're wondering how you got a cab so fast in this rain.
Well, it's because I've been sitting here admiring this window display.
You see, I work here part-time at this art gallery.
Uh, excuse me, if you don't mind, I really don't feel much like talking.
Just take me to the Metropolitan, okay?
Oh, I wasn't talking, I was just Hey!
I don't know how to make it any clearer than that.
Please take me to the Metropolitan.
Okay.
You charmed me into it.
Where you going?
You said the Metropolitan Museum.
I meant the one in New York.
Why didn't you stay on Madison?
It's shorter this way.
You said you were in a hurry.
You are taking a longer route than you need to.
It's not any longer.
You know, wait a minute.
Are you accusing me of jacking up the fare?
No.
I'm accusing you of trying.
Unfortunately, I caught you.
Hey, look, Mister.
I swear I'm not trying to cheat you.
Now if you want, I can take you back where I picked you up, and we can start over and I'll take a different route.
Thanks, but I've seen Jersey.
Okay, out of the cab.
It's pouring rain out there.
The law says you have to take me wherever I want to go.
There's no way you can make me leave this cab.
Rape rape rape!
You may have a little trouble getting that story to stick when the police find out I'm the National Secretary for the Gay Liberation Force.
We'll be there in a few minutes.
Next time be a little more careful who you try and rip off.
Look, Mister, I realize we've had our differences but you owe me $2.85.
Here's a dollar.
I'm not paying for the scenic route.
Hey, wait a minute, Mister!
Mister, you forgot your briefcase.
Oh.
Hey, come back here!
He's faster than he looks.
Come on, come on.
Jacks or better.
All right, give me something good.
Not if I can help it.
Oh, sweet heaven.
Did I tip my hand again?
Only to the trained eye.
Why do I do that all the time?
Hi, guys.
Hey, Elaine.
What do you say?
I'm not sure.
I just had a really bad fare today.
Hey, Bobby, she thinks she had a bad fare.
What happened?
I had the QANTAS koala bear get carsick in my cab.
And you don't want to know what a koala bear does when he gets carsick.
Hey, Alex, could I talk to you for a moment?
Huh?
Yeah, sure.
Deal me out.
I'll sit in for you.
What's wrong?
I feel really strange.
Why?
What is it?
Well, you know that art gallery where I work part-time?
And where they treat me like I was some sort of receptionist?
Yeah.
You mean the place where you work as a receptionist.
Yeah.
Well, they let me design their new window display for their new exhibit and everybody loved what I did.
Now, it's just staring out on Madison Avenue.
People are even congratulating me.
No wonder you're down.
You realized your lifelong ambition.
I know, but it just doesn't seem like my life, you know.
Things like this never happen to me.
That's why I got a little crazy and I pushed.
I invited them all to a party, and they accepted.
Oh, hey, sounds like you're on a roll.
Let me know how it turns out.
I was kind of hoping that maybe you'd come.
See, I'd really like to have one person there that I don't care about impressing.
How can I turn down an invitation like that?
Yeah, and one more thing-- when you're at the party can you remember that nobody knows that I'm a cab driver?
See, if they knew I drove a cab at night they'd find it a little unusual.
I can't afford to be unusual yet.
So you actually lie about your job?
I don't lie.
I fudge.
I'm kind of hoping that maybe you won't tell them that you're a cab driver, either.
Oh, no.
I won't do that, Elaine.
Oh, come on Nope!
It's one little thing.
No, it's not just one little thing.
Hey, sure it is.
Ask anybody.
Hey, guys, can you believe him?
He won't tell one little lie for me.
The only guy I know that never told a lie was my dad.
Come on.
Never?
Nope.
He once told me "John, remember your father's words.
"The liar's punishment is not that he is not believed but that he cannot believe anyone else".
John, George Bernard Shaw said that.
He did?
Your father was George Bernard Shaw?
Alex, Can we talk about this?
What do you want him to lie about?
Maybe I can do it for you.
I'm throwing a party Friday night.
Hey, it's a little short notice, but I can make it.
Why are you having a party on Friday night?
We're all going to miss a lot of business.
Well, actually guys, this is a party I'm throwing for the people at my art gallery.
Who cares, the more, the merrier.
Right?
They don't understand.
Oh, I get it.
We're not invited.
How come we can't go to the party too?
'Cause we're nobodies.
We're stupid, ignorant, low-life cabbies.
Oh.
What do you think, Latka?
Latka, in English.
If they don't come, I don't come.
I'm sorry.
They can't come.
All right, then I come without them.
All right!
All right!
You can come.
If it means that much to you.
If it doesn't matter to you that you screw me up with my bosses or ruin the one chance I have to send my kids to a decent school then, by all means, just come to my party.
What's the address?
Hey, you come with me.
I know where it is.
Thank you very much.
Let's go get something to eat, and I'll tell you about my outfit.
Hey, Elaine, hey, don't worry about us.
Nobody's gonna know we're taxicab drivers.
Come on.
We'll cover it up.
All right?
Okay.
All right.
See you later, Alex.
Ahem!
You're in luck.
Looks like you got a chance to nab Louie for your guest list.
Yeah, I might give your party a tumble.
Perhaps some of those art-world cuties might want me to pose for them au naturel.
Louie, you're not invited.
What do you mean?
I mean if you're even seen in the vicinity of my apartment Friday night I'll have you arrested.
Oh, really not invited.
Okay.
Who needs you?
Come on let's get this garage back to normal!
Hey, Latka!
You finish cleaning that cab yet?
Phew!
Who drive a sick koala bear?
Alex?
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Did I get the wrong night?
No, this is the night.
Well, don't bother to introduce me.
I'll just mingle.
How are you?
I played a little trick on you, Alex.
Oh?
I told you the wrong time so that you'd get here early.
Great trick.
Why?
Well, see, you're doing me a favor.
Now that you're here, no one has to go through the embarrassment of arriving first.
You know how uncomfortable that can be.
I can only imagine.
Besides, I'm a little insecure about this party and I wanted someone to tell me how nice the place looks.
Well, you can start anytime.
Oh, yes.
It looks great.
No, it really does.
I like that.
Oh, and I like that.
And I really like this.
Thanks.
You know, this was hard.
I had to borrow some furniture and move the kids' beds upstairs.
I'm really knocking myself out for this party.
But I think I'm going to be okay as long as my cheese puffs are a hit.
Oh Delicious.
Take it from a puff man.
So, is there anything I've overlooked?
Oh, uh persons.
They're coming.
Anything else?
Something for persons to drink.
That's a little bit of a problem.
You see, I used a discount liquor store.
I don't want anyone to see the labels.
They're kind of off-brands.
Like what?
Ever heard of Betty's vodka?
Gentlemen never tell.
Can I make a suggestion?
Why don't you put the stuff in a punch bowl and add ginger ale and juices.
Oh, that's a great idea.
There you go.
You know, I never even thought about mixing.
Oh I just hope I got enough champagne.
How much did you get?
Canned champagne?
I guess for those macho gourmets who like to crush something after a sip.
Oh, Alex, this is it!
Now, now, just relax.
Relax.
They're just people.
There's always the exception to the rule.
Party time for Latka?
Not until you take off those overalls.
Oh, this is good party.
No!
No!
Latka!
You've got to change into nicer clothes.
Oh  in truck  You think it's all right to have him here?
Are you kidding?
He's my pick for the life of the party.
Oh, Alex, are you sure everything looks okay?
Elaine, believe me.
The apartment looks wonderful.
Now will you just relax.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, you know, you may not believe this, but I've really calmed down a lot since you got here.
Yeah, I can see that.
Oh, um, but could I just ask you one more little favor?
Yep.
If you tell these people that you're a cab driver they'll ask how you know me, and you'll give everything away.
Elaine, is that the real reason you got me over here early?
Huh?
Oh, come on.
How could you do that?
How could you do a thing like that?
Come on, Alex.
This is a cocktail party.
Oh, for crying out loud.
Why do you have to come on so super-ethical anyway?
I am not ethical, Elaine.
I am chicken.
I don't lie for the simple reason I am afraid of getting caught.
There's nothing more embarrassing than getting caught in a lie.
Besides, if you don't lie you don't have to try to remember what you said.
Okay.
Okay.
If it happens, it happens.
All right.
All right.
I'm not going to lie but I won't say anything if I'm not asked.
Okay?
Okay.
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.
Party overalls.
Now you're talking.
Neat.
Latka learn party talk.
Yeah.
"What are you drinking?
"Aren't there a lot of phonies here?
"Let's go to my place.
Was it good for you"?
You've been teaching him.
Not me.
I was going to ask for a copy myself.
Looks like your party's a hit, Elaine.
Yeah, so far, so good.
I'm a little worried about the guys.
They don't seem to be mingling.
Yeah, only with each other.
Hey, it's your turn, Tony.
How did your parents meet?
It was in Italy Come on, you guys.
I want you to meet some people.
That's okay, we already have.
Yeah, I think we're just going to shove off.
Ah, why?
Because, we don't fit in.
We're the kind of guys who like to have fun.
Thanks a lot, Elaine.
Bye-bye.
Take it easy, Alex.
Great punch.
Bye.
Stop envying them.
Mrs. Hazeltine?
Oh.
Thank you, Elaine.
These are delicious.
Thank you.
I love your paintings.
Really?
But I don't recognize the artist.
As a matter of fact, I live with the artist.
You what?
It's my daughter.
Oh.
Except the one of the bunny rabbit.
That was done by my ex-husband.
We've been talking about the new exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art.
Have you seen it?
Oh, yes, I have.
Twice.
Did you like the Magritte drawings?
Oh.
Um would you excuse me for a moment?
There's something I've got to take care of.
All right.
Alex one of the biggest art dealers in New York just asked my opinion of an exhibit.
Oh, terrific.
Give it.
Oh.
Thank you very much.
Going to go now.
Well, I'm glad you could come, Latka.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Eh, aren't there a lot of phonies here?
Let's go to my place.
For you.
Come on.
Come on.
It must be the way he says it.
Boy, this champagne is terrific, huh?
I wonder what kind it is.
Del Monte.
My name is Paul.
I write for Art News.
Oh, I'm Alex.
What do you do, Alex?
Oh, this and that.
Sounds interesting.
This and that what?
I, uh sort of free-lance.
Oh, you're a free-lance painter.
No.
Alex.
Okay, Elaine, you win.
I put out oil fires.
I beg your pardon?
When an oil well catches on fire they call me in to put it out.
Sounds dangerous.
Yeah, well, I only get the easy ones.
You see, the main thing that got me into this line of work Oh, I'm sorry.
Just reflex.
You see, uh Actually, the thing that pulled me into being an oil-fire putter-outer is that it never gets boring.
Nope.
All holocausts may look alike but each one has a personality all its own.
If you'll excuse me, I'd like to freshen my drink for a moment, I'll be right back.
Thanks, Alex.
I know that wasn't easy for you.
Easier than I thought.
It's just your luck for this party I watched Search for Adventure.
I've never been the life of a party before like this.
I sort of like fudging.
Do you really fight fires?
Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, yes.
What is the biggest fire you ever put out?
Well, actually, I had I'm Rita.
I'm Alex.
Aren't there a lot of phonies here?
I know.
Do you mind if I say something candid?
If it's about the champagne, I had nothing to do with it.
I find you very attractive.
I appreciate your candor.
I don't usually say things like that to guys.
I hope you don't mind.
Well, I'll forgive you if you'll forgive the cheer I'm about to deafen you with.
Have dinner with me after the party.
At least.
A brief dinner.
Alex that guy is the same guy I had the fight with in front of the gallery the other night.
Really?
That's nice.
In my cab.
Elaine, please.
He must be a friend of Mrs. Hazeltine's.
Oh, no.
No.
Elaine, I'd like you to meet my very dear friend, James Broderick.
How do you do?
We've met.
We have?
Haven't we?
I'm sorry, I don't place you.
Oh.
My mistake.
Well, I'm so glad that you've come.
Would you help yourself to some refreshments?
Thank you.
He didn't recognize me.
That's terrific.
He looked right into my face and there was no sign of recognition.
He didn't know me.
He didn't know me?
Elaine, what are you doing?
I'll never forget him.
Never.
I mean, we really had a fight.
I can't believe he looked through me like that.
I was nothing to him, just a faceless cab driver.
Elaine, please.
He needs a reminder.
Elaine, now, a lot of people aren't happy unless they screw things up that are really going well.
Now, this is a very nice party.
I mean, these people are very important to you.
I'm even trying to enjoy myself.
Elaine, why don't you just forget it, hmm?
Elaine.
Take a deep breath.
Take a deeper one.
That's my girl.
Thanks.
So you don't remember me, huh?
!
Sure, I do.
I just met you I picked you up in my taxi four nights ago on Madison Avenue.
She's a taxi driver.
And you accused me of trying to cheat you on a fare.
That was you?
That was me.
How can you yell into a face for 15 minutes and then forget the face you yelled into?
Do you really mean it?
You're a cab driver?
Yes, I am.
I was right.
I find that rather hard to believe.
Well, I am.
Alex and I are both cab drivers.
What do you do for a living?
Excuse me.
Alex?
Don't talk to me, Elaine.
You're going to stay here till we're friends again.
Then we'll both grow old together.
Well, if it means anything to you I just want you to know that I will always be grateful that you taught me to simply tell the truth.
Elaine.
I only wish the truth worked for you too.
I'm not going to talk to you about it.
At least yell at me.
That will make you feel better.
You're not going to talk about it.
Nope.
I'm just going to sit here and drink your champagne.
What I don't understand is-- what's the big deal about it?
I'll tell you what's the big deal about it.
A man waits all his life for a woman like that.
What's so great about her?
What's so great about her?
She's the kind of woman only firefighters get.
She just walks up to you looks you straight in the eye and says-- "Do you mind if I say something candid?
"I find you very attractive.
"I don't usually say things like that.
I hope you don't mind".
It sounded better when she said it.
It sounded like once in a lifetime when she said it.
It sounded terrible when she stopped saying it.
You know, I have a feeling you're gonna hear from her again.
Yeah, I could sort of tell from the way she acted towards the end.
She called me garbage.
There you go.
Hey, you know how women feel about garbage.
Always wondering if what you've thrown out was important so you start digging through it until you find it again.
Elaine, don't try to make me feel better, okay?
Let's just go back to my sitting here and you looking at me feeling awful.
She spit on my shoes.
What I really feel bad about is how great everything turned out for me people admiring the way I hold down two jobs to support my family.
They're saying how great I am, you know and how terrific and open and honest I am for telling people I'm a cab driver.
Even that fare turned out to be a great guy forcing that tip on me?
This is going to pay for the party.
I'm leaving.
Alex, please forgive me.
I can't believe you won't forgive me.
I'll die if you don't forgive me.
Oh, Alex.
You're maybe my best friend.
I forgive you.
You mean it?
I don't know with those wild stories you're telling, you know?
Yes, I mean it.
From now on, I'm going to have to go back to telling the truth, only the truth.
Thank you for inviting me to your party, Elaine.
I had a wonderful time.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
So you think you can chug-a-lug, huh?
Uh-huh.
Okay, come on.
And he says, "If I could do it in my living room, I wouldn't have to do it in the back of your cab".
Hey, Tony, this guy wants to chug-a-lug against you.
Oh, yeah?
What's the bet?
Fifty.
Fifty dollars?
!
Hey, we'll all chip in.
Come on, ante up, you guys.
Ten each?
A pitcher of beer and two mugs!
Okay, here's my ten.
Alex?
How do you feel, Tony?
Thirsty.
I'm in for ten.
That's good enough for me.
All right.
Here we go.
Okay, we got our bet.
There's my 50.
Excuse me, Alex.
Oh, sure.
So, they say after divorce your life is empty and here I am watching a chug-a-lug contest.
Ready?
One two three start.
Any time, gentlemen.
Let's get out of here.
I don't want to be around when he belches.
Oh, come on, let's forget it-- I'm buying.
Same ol' rounds.
Okay.
What'll you have, John?
John?
Hmm?
What is it?
It's that girl.
Which one?
You don't have to ask, do you?
No, I guess not.
The blonde.
No.
The one with the white blouse?
No.
Oh, the other one.
See?
You picked her out.
It's just that I've never felt this way before.
I mean, this is the first time a girl sitting across from me in a bar has gotten me all excited.
What do you think, Alex?
I don't think you have to announce everything that's happening in your body.
You like her, go over and talk to her.
Just like that?
Sure.
What would I say if I did?
Say hello.
No, I couldn't say that.
I mean I never know what to say to girls.
I don't know, I just can't seem to get started.
Ah, just forget it.
Okay.
Okay, I'm going to do you a big favor and I hope you appreciate it.
What's the favor?
I'm going to give you the perfect line.
Works every time, instantly and with devastating results.
Here's what you do.
You walk up to her, tap her on the shoulder, and when she turns around, you say: "Why waste time?
Let's get married".
I think that should do it.
It's witty, it's entertaining, and it's got "married" in it.
The line has everything.
Hey, you know, I got a better one.
What?
You go up and you say: "Let's cut the preliminaries-- you want to get married"?
Hey, you know, that is better.
Shorter anyway.
We just improved on the wheel, man.
A good line really helps a lot.
So?
Nah John, there's a time when you either do it or you forget it.
You're absolutely right, Alex.
Let's forget it.
I can't forget it.
Just do it.
Just be sweet.
Real nice.
Get it right.
Just smooth.
Smooth.
Yes?
Let's cut the preliminaries.
You want to get married?
Sure.
What?
!
I was sitting over there and I wanted to talk to you, and I think there's a couple of places at the bar.
Do you want to take them?
I thought we were getting married.
Oh, sure, but not right away.
I mean marriage is important.
It can't just be jumped into.
Oh, I agree; yes.
So, we'll get married in an hour.
Oh, perfect.
Can I buy you that drink now?
Sure.
Author, author.
Preliminaries-- that's the word.
He said, "If I didn't have to do it "If I could do it in my living room, I wouldn't have to do it in the backseat of your cab".
I liked that, too.
Is it ever going to happen for me or am I just going to spend the rest of my life alone?
Alone alone alone How did I get into this?
All I said was, "I'm going for a beer.
Does anyone want to come"?
Alone.
When I came over, did you get the feeling something special was gonna happen?
Yeah.
Me, too.
Wait-- before or after you saw me?
Both, but more after.
Oh, me, too!
Me, too.
That's so amazing.
Ah, Suzanne, is this the best time you've ever had?
Absolutely.
You're not just saying that, are you?
Or have you really had a lousy life?
Oh, no.
No, I've had a great life.
And this is your best time?
Yeah.
Wow!
Me, too.
Okay, I want you to take your time with this next one, 'cause it's real important to me.
Oh.
How do you stand on bowling?
Feet together, knees slightly bent.
I use a four She bowls.
She bowls!
So what do you want to do first, get married, or go bowling?
Bowling first.
That way, if the marriage doesn't work, it won't screw up my game.
Well, so long, you guys.
We're going to go get married now.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh-- after bowling.
Good night.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, good luck.
Good bowling.
We're going bowling?
No, we're not going bowling.
Would you mind if I joined you and had a drink?
No.
Sit down.
Thank you.
Good night.
Hey, Wheeler!
Hey, Wheeler, come over here.
Do I have to?
Yeah.
We got a complaint that one of our drivers got fresh with a passenger.
Was it you?
Of course not.
I don't do that kind of stuff.
Too bad.
I wanted to find out who it was so I can give him some tips from the old expert.
You mean you used to get fresh with the passengers when you were a driver?
Only the women.
I used to pull over, turn around, and ask them if they'd like to come to my place for drinks and sex.
Oh, yeah, the subtle approach.
Did it work?
Yeah.
I don't believe you, Louie.
Well, not every time.
Exactly how many times?
Once in 2,312 times.
Oh, hi, John.
Hey, John!
Look who's here.
What have you been doing the past few days, John?
As if we didn't know.
Hey, stop it!
Come on!
You shouldn't be doing this.
Why not?
'Cause I could pulverize you.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry.
I'm just kind of sensitive about what happened.
Well, what happened?
Remember that girl I met in the bar?
Yeah?
I married her.
You what?
Oh, my!
What?
!
How could you do that?
How could you do something like that?
John, that was just a line.
You weren't supposed to do it.
John, what's the matter with you?
How could you do a thing like that?
I don't know.
There we were, bowling and joking about whoever lost paid for the marriage license.
The next thing I knew, we were eloping to Maryland in her best friend's Volvo.
John, how John, did you think?
Did you say to yourself, "What am I doing?
This has to stop"!
Yeah.
Unfortunately, I didn't say it to her.
It was like some game of chicken.
Each one of us thinking the other would call it off.
I kept thinking she'd brake any minute as we drove through New York, then through Lincoln Tunnel, then to New Jersey John, do me a favor.
Don't say every landmark from here to Maryland, okay?
It's all so weird!
It was so terrific being with her that we were in Maryland before we knew it.
Yeah, them Volvos are great.
Anyhow, this morning, we applied for the license and even bought a couple of rings.
You know, still treating the whole thing like a joke, you know and then we had dinner at this really neat Maryland McDonalds.
The food's the same but it's served by people from Maryland.
Then we checked into this really nice six-dollar motel Hey, John, I hate to be indelicate, but, uh did you?
Oh, no, no.
We were too excited for that.
Anyhow, this morning, we picked up the license, and found the Justice of the Peace-- even then, I still felt we'd never go through with it.
When the Justice of the Peace said, "Do you take this man to be your husband"?
I was sure that we'd both laugh like crazy, or she'd say no, but she didn't.
She said, "I will if he will".
The Justice of the Peace asked me if I'd take her as my wife.
I said no!
But somehow it came out yes!
And just like that, we were married.
I mean, married.
I mean, right away, we both knew it was the biggest mistake of our lives.
All the way back, we only said three words.
She said, "Need gas"?
I said, "Yes".
When we got back to town, I let her off at my apart-- our apartment and there she sits, the woman Maryland considers my wife.
I'm married!
I really am!
Alex, what am I going to do?
I'm half crazy.
A conservative estimate.
Just relax.
I know it looks very bad right now, but somehow we're going to figure out a way Oh, Burns you decided to grace us with your presence.
Well, listen here-- the next time you don't show up for work for two days, you're fired.
Hey, hey, Louie, the kid just got married.
Don't yell at him.
Oh, I'm sorry.
: The next time you don't show up for work for two days, you're fired.
John, you got to go home sometime.
I can't.
She's there.
Mrs. Me.
I don't want to be married, Alex.
I don't know-- it sounds crazy, but in my mind, it's all connected.
You get married, you have kids, you grow old, and then you die.
Somehow, to me, if you didn't get married, you wouldn't die.
Hey, Fitz, how you doing?
Ellen Rudy!
Hey, how you doin'?
Hey, Champ, how's it going?
Fine.
You want to risk your title against me?
How much?
Let's see here How about 20 bucks?
You're on.
All right.
Two beers, Rudy.
Hey, Louie.
You still owe me money on your tab.
Oh, yeah, yeah, all right.
Well, come by the garage this week and I'll give you a tire.
Let's go.
All right, now I'll say, "one-two-three, go".
All right?
Sure.
One two three.
Hey, Rudy, did they find the rest of that rat that died in the beer keg?
Go.
The new champeen.
Better luck next time, Champ.
Excuse me.
Is this the wedding party?
Louie!
Louie, I never thought I'd say this, but would you join us?
No, thank you.
John, the little woman came by the garage tonight.
She left a letter for you.
Well, let's have it.
For a buck.
Hey, the post office only charges 15 cents.
Yeah, and they're going broke.
Thank you.
Not bad-- I've been here two minutes, had a beer, and won $21.
Bye-bye.
Oh, by the way, should I change your W-2 now, or do you want to see if you have kids by tonight?
We didn't order drinks.
It's on the house.
You know, I got a "Dear John" once.
Oh, that isn't what this is.
"Dear John" You want me to read the letter?
Would you?
"Dear John, "I'm leaving you this letter because I'm ashamed to face you.
"I hate to think of what you think of a girl "who runs off and marries a total stranger.
"I don't know why "I do crazy things "but I do know you're too nice a guy "to be stuck with an immature nut like me.
Naturally, we'll have the marriage annulled" Oh.
Oh.
"Looking back, it seems like some bizarre dream.
"Any minute, "I kept expecting you would wake me up "but you didn't and I didn't.
"So we did.
"We sure did.
"Right away, I knew it was a terrible mistake "and I sensed you did, too.
"I've decided to move back with my folks for awhile, "try and get my head together.
"I hope what happened wasn't too hard on you.
"I'm sure someday "you'll meet someone you really want to marry "and whoever she is, I envy her.
"Anyway, thanks for a special weekend.
"I'll never forget it.
Or you".
And it's signed, "Your future ex-wife, Suzanne".
It's a nice letter.
I read it nicely.
And now, it looks like your problems are solved, kid.
Yeah.
You know, Alex, that's the classiest letter I ever heard.
Open, honest, sensitive.
Just like she is.
I got to get her back.
Help me get her back.
I never wanted anybody back so bad in my life.
Why do I come here so often?
I almost never have a good time.
Yes?
Mr. Caruthers?
Yes.
We're the ones who phoned you.
On the phone.
I've been wondering what that was all about.
Um, can we come in?
I guess so.
I think you'll have to open the door a little more than that.
I'm sorry, but how do I know I can trust you?
Come here.
Look at him.
Hi.
Okay.
Now, what's this all about?
Mr. Caruthers, my name is John Burns and this is my friend, Alex Rieger.
Alex will take over from here.
Oh, Mr. Caruthers, um, has your daughter told you?
Told me about what?
I guess she hasn't told you.
If you tell me what it is you want to know whether or not she has told me then I'll tell you whether or not she has told me.
I can tell she hasn't told you.
Oh, Mark, I Oh, Lillian, this is Mr. Burns.
Rieger.
And this is Mr. Rieger.
Burns.
This is my wife, Mrs Caruthers.
Yes.
How are you?
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
They're friends of Suzanne.
Oh, yes, well, Suzanne's in her room.
Oh, could you tell her that I'm here and maybe I love her?
Sit down.
First, I want to know what's going on.
Mr. Caruthers Mr. Caruthers, do you like to hear things with the lily gilded, or straight between the eyes?
Gilded.
You see, we've always tried to instill in our daughter the good grace to conceal virtually everything from us.
She hasn't told you anything?
Not since 1971.
Well, Mr. and Mrs. Caruthers, I think you better brace yourself, because what I have to tell you Someone come in?
I heard the Oh, John.
Suzanne.
Hold it.
Sit down.
This man is about to tell us something.
Well, go on, sir.
We're listening.
Oh, uh, yes, um You sure you don't want it straight?
Absolutely.
Right.
Okay, now, let's see, um  Well, how's this: do you believe in love at first sight?
I believe the notion of love at first sight is a debasement of every moral, spiritual, and ethical value that I and my family hold dear.
This is no snap.
Well, I have to give it to you straight then.
This is what happened: Three nights ago, John met your daughter in a bar, they fell in love, and after looking at each other countless times, drove to Maryland and got married.
You were in a bar?
Mark, don't you understand?
Our daughter is married.
And this man is our son.
But they're going to get divorced.
Oh.
But John wants to stay married.
Oh.
But your daughter wants to get an annulment.
Is this fun for you?
Well, once you get into it.
No, listen look, now that we all know, why don't we all just leave them alone together, so they could, uh Or we could stay and stare at each other.
That's not such a bad idea.
I think I've spent too much time ducking things like this.
Maybe the time has come to forget my fears and pay attention to my daughter.
Yes, this is it.
The time has come to stay with her and face this thing head-on.
Mr. Rieger?
Right.
Suzanne, when we were in that motel room in Maryland Hup, that's it!
Let's go, Lillian.
Mr. Rieger.
Right.
Take your time, John.
Don't worry about me.
I'll be having fun standing in the kitchenette with Mr. and Mrs. Caruthers.
You want to stay married?
I do.
I figured you'd never want to see me again.
Oh Look, Suzanne, what happened was just as much my fault as it was yours.
You know, I think that's what brought us both together.
We're both crazy.
I just think that, for some reason, we had the instinct to be with each other.
Now, I know it doesn't make sense, 'cause we hardly know each other, but right now, I'd rather follow my instinct and not make sense.
Suzanne, will you not get annulled with me?
No.
Oh, that's terrific.
No!
Wait a minute!
No what?
No, I won't get annulled.
I can't believe it.
She said, "no".
Oh, oh.
Oh, boy, you better be as nice as you seem.
I am.
Hey, let's call your folks.
Oh, Dad, Mom!
Alex!
What's wrong?
Mr. and Mrs. Caruthers, I'd like your permission to marry my wife.
Hey, man, you got rid of her.
That's great.
No, we're staying married.
Congratulations, she's a wonderful girl.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
like I do in my living room.
Oh.
Hey, Louie.
What table you sitting at?
This one.
Thanks for the tip.
John, you got change for a dollar?
Sure.
You gave me a dollar ten.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Too late.
Oh, well.
Oh, no.
Louie's going to play his favorite song.
Oh, no.
Every time he's in a bar.
Yeah.
"The Green Berets".
Yeah.
* Feelings * Whoa, whoa, whoa, feelings Why is he playing that song?
It's different.
It's not any better, but it's different.
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh He's giving me a feeling.
* Feelings  * Whoa, whoa, whoa, feelings * Whoa, whoa, whoa * Whoa, whoa, whoa Hi.
How you doing?
Terrific.
Hey, you look great.
Thanks.
How's it going, Alex?
Oh, fine, just fine.
Okay.
I'll have a white wine.
Beer.
Beer.
And a bourbon and water.
Beer, please.
Okay.
with a twist.
Gee, I'm sorry.
We're out of that.
Thank you very much.
Well, there's a man who knows what he likes.
Yeah.
* Feelings * Whoa, whoa, whoa You know, it would be nice if one of you guys went over there and got him out of his misery.
You okay, Alex?
Excuse me.
I'll go with you.
No, I'm going to talk to Beverly.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Hey, uh, Beverly listen, I got some bad news.
I went to the doctor.
He told me I only had 40 years to live.
I don't know what to do with all that time, so would you go out with me Saturday night?
Thanks, anyway, but I can't.
It's because I was kidding around, huh?
I have this terrible habit-- I like to make girls laugh.
Kitchy-kitchy  There, I did it again.
No, look, I really want to take you out.
What night are you free?
I'm sorry, Alex.
I can't.
Why not?
Because I make it a rule not to go out with cab drivers.
Well, that's a stupid rule.
Well, it's very important to me to keep my personal life private, you know?
And this is a cabbie's hangout.
I mean, if I was a secretary on Wall Street, I wouldn't go out with the stockbrokers.
If I was in a factory, I wouldn't go out with factory workers.
If I was a nurse in a hospital, I wouldn't go out with the sick people.
No.
You mean you wouldn't go out with doctors.
Hey, I have my rules, but I'm not crazy.
* Feelings * Whoa, whoa, whoa, feelings * * Whoa, whoa, whoa, fee * Hey, who killed the music?
You did.
Alex, I need I need that song.
I'm real down.
I need that song real bad.
Louie, I'll give you a buck, you don't play that song again.
Okay.
Aw, you're better off without her.
Uh-uh.
Try again.
Can I sit down?
No.
It's been a rough night.
All right, all right.
As long as you're not obnoxious.
So what are you losers up to?
That was obnoxious?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, okay.
I apologize.
Whoo!
Whoo!
You bet, whoo.
That's the first time I ever apologized.
But I did it because there's something I really have to say.
What's wrong?
I got a letter inviting me to my 20th high school reunion next Saturday and I'm not going.
So what?
I don't go to my high school reunions.
Who wants to sit around and watch a bunch of guys sucking in their stomachs?
What good would that do?
No, you don't understand.
I'd really like to go.
You see, everything was really tough for me in high school.
Everybody was crummy to me all the time.
The only thing that kept me going was these two promises I made to myself.
One was I would get Sheila Martin to like me.
And, two, that I'd get even with everybody else.
Gee, you really had it that tough in high school?
Oh, look, it's nothing personal, but I put in 12 hours today Everybody used to pick on me.
I don't mean just as I passed them in the halls.
I mean, they used to line up and take turns.
I used to just stand there and wait for the last guy to take his shot.
Yeah, we get the idea, Louie.
Yeah, and that's only the top of the iceberg.
I got stories that will tear your hearts out.
Like what?
Did I offend you in any way, Elaine?
No.
I just want to hear what happened.
He's never opened up to us like this before.
And the world has never come to an end, but that doesn't mean we root for it to happen.
Another beer, please.
Make it two.
There was this guy, Stanley Tarsus.
He was a really nasty, rotten person.
You know the type?
Yeah.
He used to play this one trick on me all the time just to show that I would fall for it every time he did it.
What did he do?
Alex, you got something on your shirt.
That!
Rotten person-- Stanley Tarsus.
That ain't such a bad story.
There was this guy in my high school, Lou Vanelli-- he used to tear your chest hair out with his bare hands.
Gee, I miss those days.
Okay, get ready to sob your spleens out.
I went to my high school senior prom alone.
The theme was "April love".
April love?
Is for the very young.
The only reason I went to the prom was because, even though she was with another guy, I just wanted to see what Sheila looked like on prom night.
That's how hooked I was on her.
So I walk in, I say hello to a few people-- "Hello, hello, hello".
I tell them my date was delayed.
She couldn't make it until after her Broadway show's curtain came down.
I had to make up stories like that.
Aw, Louie.
If you're trying to make me feel better how about being a little bolder?
Stop it.
So what happened then?
I kept on looking for Sheila and this guy comes up to me-- Stanley Tarsus, you remember him?
Yeah.
The nose guy.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
He comes up to me, and he says, "Hey, Louie, how'd you like to sit at a table with us and Sheila"?
I smiled at him.
I didn't want nothing but to just sit where I could look at her.
So I walked through this crowded gymnasium and I see Sheila.
She looked so beautiful.
She looked just like a beautician.
Wow!
And I could see she was smiling big.
And everybody said, "Hey, Louie, come on over and sit next to Sheila".
And I figured, "Boy, I lucked out".
And I moved over to the other side, and I saw they had a high chair there.
Aw.
Well, what did you do, Louie?
Man, what did you do?
I says to them, "Okay, you did it.
"You got me good.
Enjoy yourselves".
They sure took my advice.
They were still laughing when I left.
And I went home, and I swore to myself then that one day I'd come back a big shot-- with all the money there was-- and I'd walk into one of their high school reunions and make them all eat crackers, if you know what I mean.
And now, I'm not sure being a taxi dispatcher is enough to do the job.
Well, why don't you just go in there and lie?
Everybody lies.
It's too big a job.
It's got to be done great.
I'm not a good enough actor.
You know, I can't believe you just said that, Louie.
It's true.
Yeah, I know, but, like, incredible.
It's what I was just thinking.
What?
Okay, now, the important thing is that they're convinced that you turned out great, right?
Yeah.
It's basically an acting job.
Ohh, I know what you're thinking.
That would be great!
What would be great?
I want great.
Yeah?
You're kidding.
I mean, do you really think so?
Don't tease.
All right.
Let me explain one thing to start out with.
Now, I've been studying you for a long time, Louie.
And I know that, if I ever got any acting breaks, that I'd want to use, like, a lot of things that you have in certain roles.
I mean, you're an extraordinary character, Louie.
Yeah, so?
Sometimes, when you're yelling at me, I can't concentrate on what you're saying 'cause what I'm concentrating on are your character traits-- you know, the way your eyes pop out, and the way that vein stands out in your neck, and the spit that gets in the corner of your mouth.
Yeah.
It's everything, you know?
The way you walk, the way you use your voice.
I want the part, Louie.
I want to go into that reunion and convince them that I'm Louie De Palma.
Now, maybe I can't get any acting jobs but, if I can pull this off, I know I'm going in the right direction.
Let me do it, Louie.
I want to do it.
Let me be Louie De Palma at the reunion.
It's impossible.
It's not.
It's 20 years later, right?
Everybody's changed.
I'll make my hair dark.
I grew in college.
I'm too complex a person.
You can't be me.
You can't be me.
It won't work.
It won't work.
It's crazy.
It's crazy.
You can't talk like me.
You can't talk like me.
Maybe it would work.
Maybe it would work.
My name's Louie De Palma.
May I have my tag, please?
Thanks.
Louie?
Louie De Palma?
Yeah.
George.
Georgie Wilson.
George!
Gee, you've changed so much.
You look taller.
Well, yeah.
It's a weird thing.
I shot up in college.
They wrote it up in all the medical journals.
Well, it's great to see you again.
Who we kidding?
It wasn't so hot the first time.
Hey, George, seen Sheila?
Sure.
She's right over there.
Thanks.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Pretty tame reunion, huh?
I got a hunch it's going to liven up some.
Louie?
Uh, Louie De Palma?
Louie?
!
I'd stop you, but I like the sound of your voice.
But I mean But what?
You're surprised I'm too big for the high chair?
What do you mean?
You don't remember?
Senior prom, April love.
I come over.
High chair.
Huh, huh, huh?
Oh, yeah, I did do that, didn't I?
Did you?
it was just the group, Louie.
I mean, a bunch of us got high even before we got to the prom.
I'm so embarrassed.
I don't know how I'm going to make it up to you.
Well, uh, that's one of the purposes of this evening.
To figure it out.
May I have this dance?
Wonder how I'm doing at the reunion.
I'm sure you're doing great, Louie.
It was swell of Bobby to go for me.
I wonder if he met Sheila yet.
Yeah, he might be with her right now.
Must be something really lousy with my life if I couldn't go there and admit I was a dispatcher.
Oh, everyone's a little unhappy, wishing they were doing something else.
Hey, you're wearing your jacket tonight.
Yeah.
Hard to tell I'm a cab driver, huh?
Till I stand, and you hear the rattle of $70 in change.
What?
Would you quit kidding around for just a minute?
Oh.
Did you hear what's happening at the reunion tonight?
Is Bobby still going through with it?
Yeah, he's going through with it.
He's got an incredible disguise.
That's him right there.
Alex, just be sure and tell me the details when you find out what's happening.
I really do want to hear.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Hey, Louie, would you mind paying now?
I'm getting off in five minutes.
That's all right.
I'll take care of it.
Hey, uh, what if I walked you home?
Don't be hard on us.
Come on, we've been through this.
No, it's not what you're thinking.
Haven't you heard?
The news is full of it.
Packs of wild dogs roaming the streets.
I just thought you might want someone along to hurl his body at them.
Listen, I'll see you tomorrow.
I want you to give me all the details, okay?
And they say rejection isn't fun.
You know, I'm dying here, not knowing what's going on over there.
You know what I mean?
Huh?
Yeah.
What would be the harm if I just strolled over there and took a peek?
No, no, eh, no.
No.
Surely, there's a remote possibility.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, no, no, no, no.
Yeah.
No, no.
Louie, did you just say you're going to go to the reunion tonight?
Yeah, I'm going to go.
You want to come?
Just the question I wanted to hear.
Yeah, I would.
Okay, let's go.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Right.
What happened?
How come you're so happy?
'Cause Louie decided to go over to the reunion and see how Bobby's doing, and I'm going with him.
Alex, I'd love to come.
I'd like you to come, but I know how you feel about cab drivers, and I respect you.
I respect you, Beverly.
I really do.
* At the hop * You can rock and roll * You can dance, you can stroll * * At the hop * You can make it * You can shake it * At the hop * Yeah, let's go to the hop * Let's go to the hop    Louie.
Lou?
Don't worry about it.
Remember me?
Oh, yeah.
I do.
Hi, Stanley.
Stanley Tarsus.
Come over here, Stanley.
Hey, how you doing?
Oh, real good.
Real good.
Wait for me, okay?
Oh, sure.
Hey, that's one high-price piece of goods you're wearing there, Stanley, my man.
Hey, you must be doing real good.
Oh, I have no complaints, financially speaking.
Is that right?
Yeah.
You see, I'm a waiter at the Park Pavilion.
Oh, great.
They promoted you from busboy.
I don't think you understand.
That means that I make $20,000 a year.
That's just in salary.
I make another $40,000 in tips, of which I declare about $10,000, which gives me the equivalent of about $100,000 a year.
Now, how are you doing, Louie?
Well, not nearly as good, I'm afraid to say.
I've only got a civil service job.
I'm an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service.
Not a good night for you, is it, Stan?
Especially with you being on your way to jail and everything.
Ooh!
Ooh!
You even spilled something on your tie.
Where?
There.
You are quite a man, Louie De Palma.
I figure you're about Thank you.
Hey, watch where you're going.
You got to excuse me.
This is the worst night of my entire life.
That was Stanley Tarsus.
Him?
He was Oh-ho!
Bobby did it.
Bobby did it.
It really worked.
I never thought it would, 'cause it was the craziest stunt in the world.
I thought of it.
I love that you thought of it.
Well, I didn't think of it.
I love you for admitting that you didn't think of it.
I can't lose tonight.
Let's dance close and pretend not to notice.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
All these mo-mos trying to learn how to do my steps, wishing they were with my girl.
I feel real good.
And yet No, no, no.
Anything you say beyond that has to fall in the category of pushing it, Louie.
I just want to touch Sheila's hair.
I've always wanted to do that ever since high school.
Don't do it, Louie.
Why not?
What harm could it do?
Come on.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Go ahead.
Oh!
Whoa!
Whoa!
I don't know about anybody else, but I'm really enjoying myself!
Thank you!
Oh, thank you.
Oh, see you!
Night, Mr. Walters.
Mmm.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Excuse me.
We're looking for Louie De Palma.
Well, we got one, but ours is in the men's room.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
We're with the Immigration Department.
Oh?
We're trying to find a Latka Gravas.
A Latka Gravas?
Do you mind if I see your identification?
Thank you.
I never heard of him.
Gentlemen, we're going to grab a cup of coffee.
We'll be back in a few minutes to see Mr. De Palma.
Fine.
Latka.
Get out of there.
Latka.
What do those men from the Immigration Department want to see you for?
They send letter.
Let me see.
Yeah, it's from the Immigration Department.
Latka, how long ago did you get this?
Two weeks.
How come you didn't have any of us translate it for you?
Did it myself.
How far did you get?
"Dear Allen".
That's "Alien".
Latka's Student Visa ran out a month ago.
Listen to this.
"If you do not contact this office by"-- that's four days ago-- "a warrant will be issued for your arrest".
Uh-oh.
Latka, those men were here today to arrest you.
What means "arrest"?
Prison.
Uh behind bars.
Jail.
Police.
Oh, no.
I  Latka, Latka, Latka, sit down.
Just sit down.
Latka, La Do you have your papers?
Papers?
Papers.
Zigzags?
No.
You know, Latka, you're in real trouble.
Hey, hey, hey, what's the big deal?
The worst thing that can happen is they send you back where you came from.
You ever see any of the letters Latka gets from his homeland?
They have postage stamps that honor barbed wire.
Okay, you bozos.
I cleaned all your filthy graffiti off the walls of the can.
And I want you to know what you wrote about me in there was disgusting.
Some of it ain't even true.
You should see what's written about you on the walls of the ladies' room.
I know what it says in there.
I wrote it.
Hey, Louie, Louie, a couple of guys a couple of guys came in here looking for Latka.
They said they're going to come back and talk to you.
What do they want Latka for?
They want to arrest him as an illegal alien.
So, why didn't you just give him to them?
Do I have to do everything around here?
What?
Louie, we've got to help Latka.
This is very serious.
Serious?
What's serious?
Hey, Louie!
You're not going to turn him in, are you?
Well, I ain't lying to no feds.
I can't do it.
I won't do it.
You can get into too much trouble doing that.
Those guys scare me.
Louie, this is Latka's life we're talking about here.
If we don't help the guy, we may lose him.
So?
Oh, come on, Louie.
I don't want to embarrass you, but if it's anybody you sort of love, it's Latka.
Hey, John, it's not going to work.
You're laying it on a little thick.
No, he's not.
Latka's the poodle I never had.
Bring on those cops!
Hey!
Get Latka outside.
Come on, Latka.
Under the cab.
Pretend like Hey!
They're coming.
All right, all right.
Just be normal.
Just be normal.
I don't think this is a full deck.
Doesn't make any difference.
They'll never know.
They'll never know.
Officer!
What are you doing?
They like to be called officers.
Did Mr. De Palma come back?
Ah, yes, sir.
Right there.
Are you Louie De Palma?
Yes, I am.
We're investigators from the Department of Immigration and Naturalization.
He's under that cab.
Louie!
You swine!
Mr. Gravas?
Come out, please.
Taxi!
Fifth Avenue and  I don't know that intersection.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Latka.
We've been looking all over town for you.
Have you been back there the whole time?
Latka, now listen to me good, because I've been thinking about this.
I think you're just making things worse by running.
Who told you that?
No, I think it's best that you turn yourself in.
Well, we'll try to find a good lawyer for you that can help.
I know, I wish there was some other way, but I can't think of any.
Well, Latka need "Woman".
Yeah, sure, that'll take your mind off your troubles for a while, but, uh No, no.
Latka need woman to eh to "marry".
To marry.
Oh, I see.
Yeah, if you marry an American woman they won't deport you.
You take tongue right out of my mouth.
So, all we have to do is find a woman, right?
Got any ideas?
Phyllis George.
Right.
Phyllis George.
Good morning, everybody.
Hey, it's my pal, Latka!
Hey, I knew you'd get away, buddy!
That's why I was buying you time when the feds came in.
We really put one over on them, didn't we, pal?
Hey, Latka when's the last time I gave you money?
A long time, huh?
How about if I if I give you a buck, huh?
You like that?
You want to play hard ball, huh?
Well, how about two bucks?
How did you like that?
Money talks, boys  What, are you crazy?
Kind of wonderful, isn't it?
It never occurred to him to just drop it.
Hi, guys.
Hi, Elaine.
Hey, Elaine.
How you doing?
How you doing?
Elaine?
Elaine?
Elaine?
Yeah?
Oh, Elaine Oh, Elaine  Oh That's the sweetest thing anybody ever said to me.
I think.
Hey, you want to tell me what's going on here?
Well, Elaine you were just proposed to.
Aw No, really.
They won't send Latka out of the country if he marries an American citizen.
Yeah, Elaine, what do you think?
Are you guys serious?
Ooh!
Hey, come on, we know how you feel, but look at it this way-- it wouldn't have to be like a real marriage.
Just a paper marriage.
Right.
You could get divorced soon after.
Right.
I mean, you don't have to sleep with him or anything like that.
Who asked you?
Latka, believe me, I am very, very flattered, but I'm sorry.
I can't marry you.
Please?
I'm sorry.
Please, please?
N-o.
Oh, boy, we will be so happy.
No.
N-o spells "no".
Aw, shup.
Hey, everybody!
I'd like you to meet a new friend of mine, Vivian Harrow.
Vivian has agreed to marry Latka.
Hey, that's great!
This one I found her Alex!
What?
You can't let Latka just marry this hooker.
She's not a hooker.
She's a call girl.
Look, I don't like it, either, but it might be our only hope.
Look, it's temporary.
What day is good for you, Vivian?
Well, I got part of Thursday afternoon open.
Okay, Thursday it is.
Thursday.
Okay, Thursday.
Okay, but remember.
You said 15 minutes, I'm gone I never have to see the guy again and no strings attached.
Right.
No strings.
Come here.
Latka?
I want you to meet Vivian.
She's agreed to be your bride.
How do you do?
I love you.
Latka, talk to me.
Latka?
Latka, I'll make you talk to me.
I'll keep saying your name until you talk to me.
Latka, Latka Latka!
Latka!
Latka!
Latka!
Latka!
Latka!
Latka Louie!
Louie!
Louie, Louie!
Louie Latka, Latka Louie, Louie!
Louie, pull yourself together.
I don't understand why he won't forgive me.
All I did was turn him in.
Hey, Latka, the big day, huh?
Hey, John, you're a married man.
Why don't you give Latka some tips?
Yeah, yeah Well, uh Latka, I think the most important thing in any marriage is communication.
But it's not absolutely necessary.
Hey, this is going to be a weird wedding.
The line to kiss the bride could take a while.
I hear they asked the vice squad to give the bride away.
Would you guys just cut it out?
I mean just kindly cut it out.
I mean, we could try to treat this like a wedding, couldn't we?
You know, instead of all these locker room jokes, I think we should consider Latka's feelings.
It's not a joke to him.
I love her.
See?
So I don't know about the rest of you, but believe me, I'm going to try to do the most I can to make this the best wedding two kids have ever had.
She's real interesting, this one.
Hi, Latka.
Hello, Vivian.
Vivian!
Um, how about dressing up for the wedding?
What do you think?
I plan to.
Oh, you're going to wear a white dress?
A white halter.
How about wearing my wedding gown?
Oh, sure, honey.
I've dressed up as everything from Pocahontas to Darth Vader.
You want me in a bridal gown?
You got it.
Okay, great.
Now all we need is a minister.
Hey, there's a minister that hangs around down at Mario's.
I'll go and see if he'll perform the ceremony for us, all right?
Hey, Bobby, thanks.
Good, Bobby, good.
We could get flowers Oh!
Excuse me, Immigration Officer.
I'm trying to get out of your way, Immigration Officers.
Hey, Bobby.
Bobby.
That's all right.
You don't have to do that.
No?
Latka's going to be okay now.
Latka here is marrying an American citizen.
It's not okay if he's only doing it to stay in this country.
It's got to be a real marriage.
Oh, of course, it's a real marriage I'm afraid we'll have to check that out.
Mr. Gravas, we're going to have to question you.
How long ago did you meet this woman you're going to marry?
"How "How How" Can anybody else answer for him?
How" I'm up for retirement in two years.
Yeah, I can.
No, let me.
No, I will.
No, I want to do it.
"How" Louie, I think it's best that I do.
No.
Mr. Richards?
All right, Mr. De Palma Let's have it straight.
If you're lying to me, you're committing a crime.
Is this a legitimate marriage?
Of course it's legitimate.
It's love, I tell you.
Latka's in love with this girl, and nothing can change his mind.
Nobody could talk to the guy.
I tried to talk him out of it.
I said, "Latka, she's from the other side of the tracks.
"She's classy, and you're just a grease monkey.
It'll never work out".
But he doesn't care, because it's love.
Her family is totally against it.
They threatened to disown her.
In fact, they even went so far as to offer Latka $1,000 to leave their daughter alone, but he wouldn't take it.
And if that isn't love, then I don't know what is, Officer.
Thanks for your time, gentlemen.
Not at all.
Whoa!
I want none of that stuff!
Oh, good No!
Drivers touching me?
I don't want nobody touching me, except him.
Aw Hey, Louie, that was a very nice story you made up.
You know that?
You mean about the family offering money to give up the girl?
Yes.
I didn't make that up.
That happened to me five years ago.
Really?
That surprises me, Louie.
Except I changed two things.
The parents only offered me a lousy 50 bucks.
What was the other thing?
I took it.
Okay, everybody let's take our seats now.
Come on, just find a seat anywhere.
Look, the bride's people on one side, the groom's people on the other.
I know, it makes no difference.
Just sit down.
Okay, and stay there.
I think I'm going to go I'm going to go check on the bride, okay?
Good, good.
Latka, you ready?
All right, Latka?
Listen.
You're each going to come down from over there, all right?
Hey, everybody.
This is Reverend Jim, uh Jim?
That's it.
Just, uh Reverend Jim.
Uh, uh, well, um He's going to perform the ceremony for us.
Reverend Jim, I'm Cabby Alex.
Listen, I don't want to be impolite but you are a minister, aren't you?
Certainly.
I was ordained in '68-- Church of the Peaceful.
The church was investigated and cleared completely.
Cleared of what?
Why go into it?
It doesn't even exist anymore.
But I assure you, I'm a minister recognized by the state.
Now, does anybody have a drink around here?
Reverend Jim Reverend Jim, look we'd like the ceremony to be just as brief as possible, okay?
I'll do my best, but I'm kind of out of practice at weddings.
How long has it been since you done one?
Always.
This is my first.
Well, we'll try to be gentle.
Thank you.
Okay, she's ready.
Oh, good.
Latka, you ready?
You know, it's too bad we don't have any music.
Well, we could always    Hey, Louie Hey, you know Don't give me no guff.
Geez!
My mother paid good money for these lessons, and I thought Latka should have some music for his nuptials.
Wow!
Oh, she's beautiful.
Thank you.
Louie.
You are very pretty.
Thank you, Latka.
Um we're gathered here today to join these two people in marriage.
The question often asked in our time is: Why marriage?
The answer is hard to see, but as obvious as a heartbeat to feel.
We marry to have a friend, a lover.
We marry to deny solitude's cold hands on us.
We marry because after all the other, uh alternatives have been explored, we still want to and need to and must.
I bet you all thought I was going to screw up, didn't you?
Does the couple have anything to say?
Oh, yeah, um Latka wanted me to read you something.
He stayed up all night going through his dictionary trying to translate what he wanted to say to you.
So, here it is.
"Even though we just recently have been formally introduced, "somehow my mind tells me that you will always be a tart to me".
"A part of me".
"A part of me".
"And I know, even though we not speak same language we have the same language of the heart".
Latka Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
He does he does.
And do you, Vivian, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?
Um yep.
This is heavy.
If no man here has any reason why these two should not be married by the power invested in me, I do pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Thank you very much.
We will love forever.
You bet, honey.
Um, look, I got to go.
Um I got an appointment over at the Hilton I'm late for.
It was fun, huh?
Yeah.
Thanks, guys.
Ah, you Hey, Latka Latka, don't take it so bad, huh?
Yeah, don't worry, Latka.
There'll be somebody else.
You'll see.
I said we shouldn't have done this.
Wait.
Latka wants to say something.
What is it, Latka?
No honeymoon?
No honeymoon.
Boy, America's a tough town.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Let's go, Rieger.
Heave the old tush this way.
Where's your friend Burns?
John?
Out somewhere.
I don't know.
Why?
Is it important?
I want to give him a kiss.
Oh.
I got a driver waiting for his cab who makes us a profit.
Would you give him a break, Louie?
The guy just got married.
They're both in school.
They need all the money they can get.
That's not for me to know.
All right.
A good dispatcher has got to be impersonal, separate, aloof.
That's why you notice I never fraternize with you drivers.
I thought that was our choice.
Just don't tell me about the newlyweds and their hard times.
I don't want to hear.
I don't want to know.
I don't give a damn.
Just one thing bothers me.
What's that?
Why hasn't the young couple invited me to dinner?
After all you've done for them.
Okay, Latka, now try this one.
Are you hungry?
Oh, polishing up for tonight's dinner conversation, huh, Latka?
Yes.
I am so hungry I could eat a dog.
Not quite, huh, Latka?
No, Latka, it's not "I could eat a dog".
It's "I could eat a horse".
Eat horse?
Echhh!
You'd rather eat a dog?
Okay, Latka, come on.
Back to work.
Now, let's say you walk in, okay?
You walk in, and you look around, and you say Please pass the salt.
No, Latka.
You look around, and you say, "My, what a lovely apartment".
My, what a lovely apartment.
Please pass the salt.
No.
Soon.
Soon.
He likes salt.
Okay, now, let's say that you walk in, and they put you at the table, right?
And they give you some food, and they say, "Are you hungry"?
And you say, "I'm so hungry I could eat a" Cow.
No.
Uh bear?
No.
Please pass the salt.
Pass the salt.
I was waiting for that.
Hi, fellas.
Hi, John.
Hi, John.
Guys, you ready for tonight?
Oh, are we ever.
You hungry, Latka?
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.
Echhh!
Burns.
Uh-oh.
Get over here.
Here you go.
Burns, I got a pencil in my hand, and I'm writing down the words, "Dinner with Burns".
Now, all I have to write down is when.
Oh, well, Louie, you see, right now When?
Look, Louie, this isn't right.
I mean, down here you're my boss, and I do what you say.
But who I have in my home is my own business, and I won't be pressured about it.
All right.
All right.
I wasn't going to come, you know.
All I wanted was an invitation.
All you had to say was, "Louie, come".
And I would say, "Thanks, but no, because I make it a policy never to fraternize with the help".
But no!
You couldn't even do me that little courtesy.
You hurt me, Burns.
Uh Louie Would you come to dinner with Elaine next week?
I'd be delighted.
It's 8:00 p.m.?
John, would you taste this?
Oh, sure.
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
I burned my tongue.
Let me kiss it and make it better.
Mmm Gee, I can hardly wait for my first sunburn.
There they are.
Okay.
Uh okay.
Welcome.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Latka.
Hi.
My, what a lovely apartment.
Oh, thanks, Latka.
Oh, these are for you.
Oh, thanks.
I think I've got a vase.
Want wine?
I make myself.
Thanks, Latka.
Hey, look, honey, homemade wine.
Oh, great.
Is it red or white?
Brown!
I'll open it.
Dinner is almost ready.
Are you guys hungry?
Are you kidding?
I could eat a horse.
What's wrong?
I think I stole his line.
I'm sorry, Latka.
I said I'm sorry, Latka.
Okeydoke.
I'll pour us four glasses of Latka's wonderful, uh different, huh?
I made with I made with honey.
Oh, really?
How unusual.
Yeah, it goes equally as well with fish or meat or waffles.
Oh, uh, does anyone know a really long toast?
Vootka!
That's it, huh?
Well, good luck.
Hey, that's not bad.
Good, Latka.
You know, I sort of like it.
More?
No.
That's enough.
Thank you.
Honey, you serve this.
I'll get that.
Start without me.
Gentlemen, dinner is served.
Oh, thank you.
Could you please pass the salt?
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I swear it will never happen again.
Never.
Mmm!
You must give me your recipe, my dear.
It's just a salad, Latka.
You must give me recipe.
I think you'd better.
Lettuce and tomato.
Thank you very much.
Daddy says hello.
Oh.
Anything new?
No.
Suzanne's parents have just been great.
Do you know they pay our rent?
Oh, was that a secret?
Something wrong, Suzanne?
No!
No, it's nothing.
Will you stop, Suzanne?
Come on.
What is it?
Later, okay?
Fine.
Boy, I sure love these little tomatoes.
I used to hate the little guys, but then, one day, boom, I love them.
Just like that.
I still hate big tomatoes.
Look, I'm all out of tomato banter.
Can we try something else?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I got some upsetting news.
If you want us to leave, it's okay.
No, no, Alex.
We wouldn't think of it.
Honey, this is Alex.
We have nothing to hide from him or Latka.
Come on, honey.
You'll feel better.
All right.
Well, my folks just bought a condominium in Florida.
Oh, honey, that's okay.
That's not it.
They're moving in two weeks.
Oh, honey, that's okay.
That's not it either!
They won't be paying our rent anymore.
Suzanne, what are we going to do?
I don't know.
Gee whiz, Suzanne Why did you have to tell us now for?
John, you told me to!
Yeah, but you knew what it was.
You like cauliflower?
I always hated cauliflower.
There.
You see what you did?
He's gone back to vegetables.
Listen, I know this is serious, but No, Alex.
You don't understand.
We're wiped out.
We counted on her parents' money to get by.
We're down to the bone as it is.
And now, with this drop in our income, I don't know how we're going to make it.
Suzanne might have to quit school Why don't you quit school?
Why should I quit school?
Me?
!
Yes, you!
I'm not saying you should be the one to quit school.
Oh, yeah?
I'm just saying it's an open question.
Yeah.
We both have plans for our careers.
I want to be a nurse, and you want to be a forest ranger.
Forestry!
It's called forestry!
I'll get a degree just like a nurse, and then I'll go to graduate school, and then Then you'll go out and save Bambi's mother.
Boy, you make me mad!
You make me want to, uh Melmac.
You see that?
Ever since I married you, I'm too poor to even get mad good.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, too.
I'm sorry about this, Alex, but I just got to get out of here and take a walk.
Come on, Latka.
I think we'd better go.
Eh, wait wait a minute.
Yes?
Let's do this again sometime.
Hey, Alex, what's going on?
Oh, money trouble.
A little short, huh?
No, a little long.
You wouldn't think that having too much money would be a problem, would you?
No.
Well, it is.
A big one.
How do you get it?
Get what?
Alex has too much money.
Aw No, no.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Why don't you tell us about it, Alex.
It's not really my problem.
A couple of friends of mine have money troubles and, well, I think I can help them.
I just don't know whether I should help them.
Do we know them?
Well, what's the difference?
Well, if we know them, we can all help out.
How much do they need?
$2,500.
I don't think we know them.
Hey Hi.
Oh, John.
You don't look so good.
Well, I've been driving I've got impossible problems, and my marriage is over.
Well, in that case, you don't look so bad.
John, don't talk that way.
You just had a little disagreement with Suzanne, that's all.
No.
It's more than that.
I mean it.
After you left, we cleared the table in silence.
In silence, we made the bed.
And then, in silence, we went straight to sleep.
Sounds like a nice, quiet evening.
Straight to sleep.
Do you hear what I'm saying, Alex?
For the first time in our married life Suzanne and I went straight to sleep.
Yeah, well, some people like the mornings.
This morning we went straight to work.
John, are you sure you want to talk about this because I for one, can live without it.
Straight to sleep, after one month of marriage.
I didn't figure that would happen for ten or 20 years.
Well, John, sometimes people just aren't in the mood.
Look, we were always in the mood.
Maybe some couples don't every night, but we did, and it meant something very special to us and, last night, when we didn't I really missed it.
John, you know, maybe I'm not the one to give advice.
I mean, my marriage didn't last that long itself, but one thing I'm really sure about.
There's two words that can fix just about anything that goes wrong in a marriage-- "I'm sorry".
"I'm sorry".
I thought of that myself.
I'm going to go home right now.
Thanks a lot, Elaine.
I'm proud of you.
Just say the words.
Be nice.
Just one thing.
How do I get her to say it?
Suzanne, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
too.
Oh.
Let's not fight anymore.
We're so silly.
I know.
But now it's all behind us.
Right.
Right.
Except for one thing.
Oh?
What's that?
Well, we're still too poor for both of us to go to school.
Yeah.
Look, Suzanne, I have an idea.
Now, this may sound crazy but, but, but let's not think about school, okay?
We'll think about something entirely different-- something else-- and then maybe, when we're involved in an entirely different matter, just maybe the answer will pop right into our heads.
A very interesting theory, John.
What did you have in mind?
Well, I was thinking maybe we could go jogging, or we could go in the bathroom and scrape those daisies off the bathtub.
I hate jogging, and I like the daisies.
All right.
What?
Hello.
It's me.
Alex.
Ya!
Uh, just a minute.
It's stuck.
Are you okay?
All right?
All right?
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Alex.
What a surprise.
Hey, listen.
I can come back.
Oh, no, no.
Whatever it is, let's get it over with.
Please, sit down.
Okay.
Thanks.
Gee, I always wanted one of those.
A couch that converts to a high chair.
Listen, the reason I came over is I was thinking of loaning you the money you need.
Oh, Alex No, no, please.
Let me finish.
I'm really not sure that loaning you the money is such a good idea because, see, I've loaned money to friends a few times in my life.
It's not only getting the money back, although that's a very important factor.
It's just a question of how it affects the relationship between Did I mention that getting the money back is important?
I covered that, huh?
You sure?
Oh, yes, yes.
Okay.
It's just that well, you end up by losing friends a lot of the time, and I don't know what I would do without those warm evenings as your dinner guest and, uh You get what I'm saying?
I'm saying, do you want it in cash or a check?
Oh Alex, I really love you for making that offer.
Yeah, yeah.
So how do you want to work this?
I can't, Alex.
I mean, it's terrific of you to offer, but there's no way I can take that kind of money from you.
You sure?
I'm sure.
Uh, don't you think we should discuss this, John?
Huh?
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Why don't you talk it over with Suzanne for a second and while I go to the bathroom?
Alex, there's no need for you to go to the bathroom.
I know how I feel.
Yes, there is.
I know how I feel.
Are you upset?
Oh, just about little stuff.
I didn't know he was coming.
There are no towels in the bathroom.
And, besides that, I cannot figure out why it's okay to take money from my folks but not your friends when it comes to something as important as our education.
You're absolutely right.
It wasn't okay, either, to take money from your folks, and I knew that whenever they called us up and told us that they were moving to Florida and couldn't pay our rent anymore.
I mean, here they were, calling up with great news.
Instead of us being excited for them, we were miserable for us.
Right away, I was a different person.
I resented your folks.
I resented you.
I resented Florida.
I just can't take that money from Alex.
Look, I love going to bed every night being real proud of myself.
I'm working hard.
I've got a beautiful girl beside me.
We're starting out great.
I wouldn't feel great going to bed every night wondering how much I owed Alex, or whether I should even have taken it from him in the first place.
Is it so terrible to say that I want peace of mind?
So that's what that silly smile is on your face every night.
That's peace of mind.
You bet.
I sure would miss that smile.
What's the answer then?
The only alternative is that one of us leave school.
Well, then, maybe one of us should leave school.
Which one?
Well, I guess the only fair way to settle this is to flip a coin.
It seems crazy to have our lives running on one flip of a coin.
Okay.
Heads or tails?
I don't believe we're doing this.
Tails.
Okay.
Tails-- I drop out of school.
Heads-- you drop out of school.
Right.
Good luck.
You, too.
Here goes.
It's heads.
Oh.
Well, I guess that's that, then.
I'll quit at the end of this semester.
Oh, Suzanne!
Oh, John, it's okay.
I'll just be a nurse a little later, that's all.
You don't understand.
I lied.
It was tails.
I just want to go to school so bad!
Look, I'll go nuts if I'm a cab driver the rest of my life.
Please, let me go to school.
No.
I can't ask that.
What am I turning into here?
No, you go to school, and that's it!
And I'll go to school.
We'll take the money from Alex.
It will be okay.
We'll pay him back.
All right.
It doesn't feel quite that bad.
Alex!
Yeah?
Alex, uh We talked it over.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
And we feel that borrowing money can really hurt a friendship.
I know.
I know.
But, Alex, we decided that our friendship can stand the strain, and we'll borrow as much money as you've got.
Great.
Oh, what would we do without you?
Just another day in the life of Alex Rieger, super jerk.
Oh, Nardo.
Getting excited about next Tuesday, hmm?
What's next Tuesday?
Ooh, ain't you the cool one.
Next Tuesday, as if you didn't know, is when you and me are going to John's to dinner-- our big date.
Well, it's not a date, Louie.
Boy, we're going to have tongues wagging that night.
Huh, toots?
Just give me the receipt.
Louie, you and I are separately invited to the same place.
It's a coincidence, that's all.
You say coincidence.
I say destiny.
And dinner's just a foot in the door.
After that it's a couple of late-night drinks, a little disco dancing, and then magic time.
Louie, I want you to listen very carefully to what I have to say.
No.
Okay, if you don't want to ride a rocket to the stars, that's your business.
Thanks.
Of course, if I want to tell everyone you did, that's my business.
Okay, and if I want to tell everyone you couldn't, that's my business.
Here's your receipt.
Get out of here.
Night, Mr. Walters.
Mmm.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Latka.
How you doing?
Oh  Well, I got a little problem.
Oh  Well, there's this girl  Well, I met her a couple of weeks ago.
She's a cab driver, too.
Works out of the Bronx.
We were both in the line at Kennedy and we got to talking and we went for breakfast  Right-- one thing led to another.
So, I've been seeing her for a couple of weeks and I'm not so sure I want to go on seeing her.
Can I just tell her?
I mean, I think she likes me.
I don't want to hurt the girl.
You're right, the longer I wait the tougher it's going to get, but You're right.
I just got to take care of it today.
I will, Latka, I will, all right.
Hey, Latka, tell me something.
How come I never understand a single word you say, yet I always know what you're talking about?
Oh  Uh uh  Yeah, that must be it.
Hey, Alex.
Louie, I just had an accident in 723.
What?
Are you okay, man?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
One thing at a time.
Where's the cab?
It's upstairs.
Latka, go on up and check out the damage.
I want a complete report.
Was anybody hurt?
No, no.
It's no big deal.
I just dented my fender and knocked in the side of a parked car.
It shouldn't be more than $700-800.
A parked car?
Yeah.
Alex Rieger, 180,000 miles without an accident, voted "New York Cabbie of the Month" August 1977, just rams into a parked car?
Louie, I just couldn't help it!
I was going down 72nd street and as I was approaching Third Avenue, this dog runs out in front of my cab.
Either I hit the dog or swerve and hit this Cordoba that was parked there.
Wait a minute.
You mean, you had a choice of running over some mutt and ramming into a Cordoba?
A Chrysler Cordoba with Corinthian leather?
And you chose You made a conscious choice to hit the Cordoba?
Where are your values, Rieger?
Hey, Louie, why don't you just lay off him, all right?
Yeah, he feels bad enough.
Were there any witnesses?
No.
What about the owner of the parked car?
He wasn't there.
I left a note on his windshield.
Ooh, you left a note on his windshield.
Yeah.
Oh, good thinking, Rieger.
Otherwise, he might not know where to reach us and we couldn't pay for the damages.
Smart, smart.
Louie, you have to leave a note.
It's the law.
Well, sure it's the law.
It's also the law you can't spit in public.
You have such an elegant way of making a point, you know that?
Come on, let's get breakfast.
$700 damage just to avoid hitting a dog.
I mean, if you'd have swerved to avoid hitting an old lady, I could understand.
I'm not saying I'd agree, but I could understand.
But a dog.
You know, that was my first accident in almost six years of driving a cab.
Well, look at it this way-- you're not a virgin anymore.
Yeah, I lost my bumper.
Hey, Tony, over here.
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Tony.
Hey, I can only sit down for a minute.
I'm meeting Denise here for breakfast.
Hey, you want some coffee?
Yeah, please.
Hey, Bobby, maybe you can help me.
I got to tell Denise I don't want to see her anymore.
I don't know how to do it without hurting her.
Ooh That kind of thing's never easy to do.
I tell you what.
This is what you do.
You put all the blame on yourself, right?
You tell her that you're not worthy of her, you know, that she can do better.
Nah, she'd never buy that.
I've been trying to figure out a way to do this all week.
Anybody got any suggestions?
Hey, Elaine, what do guys usually do when they want to get rid of you?
Thanks a lot.
You know what I mean, Elaine.
Tony, just be honest.
Just tell her how you feel and then take your lumps.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Hey, Alex, you ever have to break up with a woman you were close to?
Oh, what am I saying.
He was married.
I mean, do you remember what you said to your wife to break up with her?
Yeah, I remember what I said.
I said, "Why is that man wearing my pajamas"?
Tony?
Hi, Denise.
Hi, baby.
Let's sit over there.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends?
There doesn't seem to be much point.
Okay.
Denise, this is Elaine, Alex, Bobby and John.
Hi, how are you?
Well, we were just leaving.
Have a nice breakfast.
It was nice knowing you.
You want some?
No, thanks.
Sure?
Help you stay awake, take a few pounds off or do the 100 in 9.7.
You know I don't do that kind of junk.
So how you doing, honey?
I'm okay.
Denise, I got something to say.
I wish there was a a smarter way to lead up to this.
I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Well There might have been some smarter ways of leading up to that, Tony.
I mean, some guys would have tried to soften me up with a lot of flattery.
Or they might have made up some long, involved story.
Not you.
You just came right out with it.
I can't say you weren't straight with me.
I guess that's what I've always liked about you.
Thanks.
That's also why I'm never gonna let you go.
* taxi, honey  Hey, Rieger.
You got to help me so I can fill out this property damage report.
Oh, not the box again, Louie.
Come on over here.
What's he doing?
They're going to reenact the accident.
It's company policy-- it's fun.
Hold the box here.
Okay Latka watch?
Here, sit down.
All right.
Now, here's where it intersects with Third Avenue.
That's right.
Now, we got a stoplight here.
Right.
All right.
Okay, what color was the light?
The light was green.
All right.
It's green.
All right.
Now, you were traveling west on 72nd street?
Right.
Now, were there people in the streets?
Yeah, there were a few, it was early in the morning.
Now, where'd the dog come from?
About over here.
All right.
I don't have a dog.
What's that over there?
It's not a dog.
It's a gun, it's a gun.
Here, here.
No cockroaches, Latka.
Get that cockroach out of there.
Sorry to bother you.
All right, I got a baby.
We'll use the baby for the dog.
Okay.
I'm traveling in this direction at about 30 miles an hour.
I notice the light is green, so I start to speed up so I can make it and just then, all of a sudden, this dog runs out in the middle of the road, so I swerve to my right and I hit this parked car right here.
My right fender hits the door on the driver's side.
I carom off and I come to a stop about there.
And the dog runs off, I don't know, somewhere.
And that was it.
Phew!
Thank you very much.
Hey, Tony.
Hi, everybody.
How'd it go with Denise this morning?
Yeah, how'd it go?
Well, it didn't go exactly like I thought it would.
Well, you told her you wanted to break up with her, didn't you?
Yeah, I told her.
Just like you said-- straight and honest.
But she said she wasn't going to let me go.
What does that mean?
She wasn't going to let you go?
She didn't believe me.
She kept telling me we were really good for each other.
and that whatever I was feeling now, I'd get over.
I kept telling her, "I'm not going to get over it".
But I couldn't convince her.
She kept asking me to come back to her room with her.
Oh.
But you didn't go, did you?
Yeah, I mean, it was the toughest scene I've ever been through.
Right there in the restaurant, she started kissing me on the neck, stuff like that-- nibbling on my fingers.
It wasn't easy to say no.
Did you ever see The Wizard of Oz?
Yeah.
What's that got to do with it?
Well, remember the Wicked Witch of the West?
The one with the green face and the big nose and that ugly wart on her chin?
Yeah.
Well, I just closed my eyes and tried to pretend it was her doing all that stuff to me.
Pretended it was that ugly witch sucking my fingers.
I pretended it was that ugly witch blowing in my ear.
And I pretended it was that ugly witch with her hand on my knee.
And then And then what?
I got to thinking-- who cares how ugly the witch is?
Tony, you mean you went with her?
No, Elaine, I didn't.
I realized, you know, if I did, I'd never end this relationship.
From somewhere, I don't know where, but I got the strength to say no.
What did Denise do?
Well, I really must have surprised her.
She didn't think I had it in me either.
She just got up and left the restaurant.
I guess she finally realized that when I said it was over, I meant it was over.
Hey, Tony, you did real good, man.
Yeah, I'll say.
It was the only way.
And I'll tell you something, it wasn't easy.
All right, all right, we got a lot of cabs here.
Hey, Nardo, you got 708.
Wheeler, 204.
All right.
Rieger, 509.
Burns, 311, Burns.
Banta, 682.
All right.
Hey, Latka, get 246 ready.
I'm giving it to the new driver.
What new driver?
That one.
Hi, Tony.
Geela, you got 916.
Rutherford, you got Here you go, Louie.
You booked $19 today?
A one and a nine?
Louie, leave me alone, man.
I got enough problems.
Listen, Banta, I can make life really rough for you if I wanted to, but you're Italian and I'm Italian.
So I'm going to tell you just like I'd tell my own brother-- you better smarten up, meatball.
Hi, honey.
Yeah, hi.
Here you go, Louie.
$217?
Hey, you losers hear this?
This sweet young bimbo just booked $217.
A new Sunshine Cab company record.
Congratulations, Denise.
I'd shake your hand, but I'm afraid I'd get you hot.
Thanks, Louie.
What's that you're taking?
Just a couple of bennies and a black beauty.
What?
You know, uppers.
What are you doing?
I know about those things.
They can be hell on you.
They can ruin your health, destroy your body.
Why are you taking them?
It's how I can work and book so much.
You got enough I can give the other guys?
I'll take three.
All right.
And then I'll take three.
Three.
I'll take three.
I got one.
Okay, I open a quarter.
I raise you a quarter.
I raise you 50 cents.
All right by me, I see you.
I see you.
I see you.
I see you.
Come on, Denise, give me a break.
That's lousy, the way she keeps bugging him.
Okay, my deal.
Hey, Rieger.
What?
Move it, the boss is upstairs waiting for you.
He wants to talk to you about the accident.
Yeah, I figured he would.
Anybody got an aspirin?
I got a miserable headache.
Baby aspirin.
Yeah, take one of these.
That doesn't look like aspirin.
Well, it works just the same.
I take them all the time when I get a headache.
You better take another one.
Thanks-- okay.
How's your headache?
Hey, I just took the pills two seconds ago.
You can't expect What headache?
What kind of pills are those?
They're called black beauties.
Oh, great, I'll have to remember that when I go to the drugstore.
Hey, wait a minute, that's amphetamines, isn't it?
Yeah.
I read about those.
Those are poison.
You can kill somebody.
You just gave me two of those?
Alex, the boss is waiting.
Yeah, Louie, I'm going.
You know, I never took anything like that before.
Oh, I thought it would really be strong, but I don't feel anything.
I guess I must have a pretty tough system.
I thought it would really hit me, but I don't seem to feel anything.
I don't feel any different then I ever felt.
I seem to keep talking, you know?
But I've talked before and even if I am talking more now than I usually do, I could stop anytime I want.
There, I just stopped.
I just stopped again.
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Bobby!
Hi, Elaine!
Hi, John!
Hi, Louie!
You got my cab?
You just came in.
You're going up to see the boss.
Right-- bye, Louie.
Bye, John!
Bye, Elaine!
Bye, Bobby!
Bye, Tony!
* Bye-bye, love, bye-bye, happiness * * Hello, loneliness * I think I'm going to die.
Denise, why you giving him that stuff?
Bad enough you got to take it.
You got to make everybody crazy?
Is that what it is?
Is that what's wrong between us, Tony?
You don't like me taking pills?
Why didn't you say so?
Man, I'll never take another pill as long as I live.
There.
Hey, what are you guys, crazy?
Denise, it ain't just the pills.
It's us.
You and me.
Got to end.
It will never end, Tony.
Okay.
Hey, Louie, you got to fire Denise.
What are you, crazy?
My best booker?
Fire her?
I want to breed her.
Hey, Louie, either you fire Denise or I quit.
Now, let me think about that.
I thought about it.
It was nice working with you.
Hey, wait a minute, Louie.
You know that chick only took this job so she could bug Tony, man.
I mean this whole thing stinks.
I ain't been happy coming to work since she's been here.
Now, if you keep her and let him go, I'm going to quit, too.
That I don't even have to think about.
Bye-bye, Bobby.
And you can say good-bye to me, too, Louie.
Yeah, and me, too.
Yeah.
So if you let Tony go the four of us quit.
So let it be written, so let it be done.
Why you quitting?
Sounds good enough for me.
If they quit, we quit, too.
Yeah.
Get back, get back, all of you!
Get back!
Now, listen to me and listen to me good.
I'm drawing a line here.
Now, you see that line?
You see it?
Look at it, look at it.
Because if just one of youse steps one foot across that line, I'll have to fire her.
I'm going to fire her.
Hey, you pill popper, you're fired.
Get out of here.
All right.
All right, Tony.
Maybe I can't work with you But you have to go home sometimes and when you do, you're going to find me there.
And if you go out to eat, you're going to find me there, too.
And if you go to the movies or you go bowling, just look around, because, baby, I'm not giving you up.
Hey, Elaine, what am I going to do?
I can't handle this.
Tony, if you want to get rid of her, you're gonna have to be mean.
You're going to have to hurt her.
I don't know if I can.
I was raised by my mother and three older sisters.
I was always taught to respect women.
Well, she doesn't give a damn about what she's putting you through.
Tony, come on.
Just get as tough as she is.
I mean, you got to stop worrying about her feelings and you got to start taking care of yourself.
You're right.
Yeah.
Denise, could I have a word with you?
Sure.
Tony, I know what it is.
You want to apologize and that's I don't want to apologize, Denise.
You don't?
No, I don't.
Tony, listen, I understand.
Shut up!
Just shut up and listen.
You ain't seeing me anymore and I ain't seeing you anymore.
We ain't seeing each other anymore.
Psychologists, they got a term for people like you.
What is it?
Uh Oh, yeah-- you got a screw loose.
You ever come around here again, I'm going to hand you your head.
I'm sick and tired of your face.
Now, why don't you just take a walk?
Why don't you get out?
You heard me, out!
I love you when you're like this.
Listen, Denise.
Tony doesn't want to tell you the real reason why he can't see you anymore, because he's afraid the truth is going to hurt you real bad.
The truth?
Yeah, the truth that he's in love with someone else.
Who?
Him.
What?
Louie, you're a homosexual?
I prefer to think of it as an alternative lifestyle.
Did you really think that I'd believe this?
I guess you really do want to get rid of me.
I never thought you'd stoop so low as to make up a lie like this.
Hey, Denise, you think I'm stooping low now?
To get rid of you, I'd marry him.
You make me sick.
Good-bye.
Elaine.
It worked.
Hey, Louie, we did it, Louie.
What do you mean, stoop so low?
Boy, you know that Mackenzie is one great boss.
I mean, I really thought he was going to blast me, but he hardly said two words to me the whole time.
I was the one who did all the talking.
I just explained the accident to him, reminded him of my good driving record, told him why Pittsburgh was going to win the Super Bowl and how I'd like to see that situation in the Middle East cleared up, and he just sat there the whole time with his mouth open.
So how's everybody here?
Am I talking too loud?
No, I don't think I am.
Hey, listen, you know Pittsburgh is gonna win.
That defense is just too strong.
Look at that backfield-- Harris, Blier, Blier's the most underrated halfback in the NFL.
Nobody blocks Blier.
He runs, he blocks.
He's got a pair of great hands.
Talking about hands, what about Swann?
You can't stop him.
When Bradshaw's off, Swann gets the ball.
And look at that defensive line.
Do you realize that they've only allowed an average of three yards per carry.
And what about those linebackers?
You can't get through them.
You couldn't drive a truck through them.
I mean, you can't get there.
Boy, am I going to be sick tomorrow.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Latka, nice threads.
Oh?
Thank you very much.
You like?
You can keep.
Hey, Latka, how come you're so dressed up?
Well, because my mother is visiting today from the old country.
Oh!
Hey!
Oh!
Hey!
You must really be excited.
When does her plane land?
Right at the end of flight.
Good, good, very good.
She coming today from the airport.
She coming right here.
Louie give me rest of day off so I could show her around the Big Banana.
Latka, I think you mean The Big Apple.
Oh, that, too.
Latka, three cabs just came in that need repairs.
What are you doing in these glad rags?
Because you said I could have the day off.
Forget it, I got a garage to run here.
Yeah, but, Louie, you promised.
Right, I promised, now I'm breaking my promise.
Get back to work.
You are a nasty man.
I'm not nasty.
A lot of guys wouldn't have given you the day off in the first place.
Go on, go on.
Hey, come on, Louie.
His mother's coming to visit him.
I'm not doing this because I enjoy it.
I do enjoy it, but that's not the reason.
Now get back to work!
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Hey, Latka.
Very sorry about this.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Yes.
When my mama comes, you could take her to Mario's for eat.
I will come later.
Oh.
I, uh I just got off a 14-hour shift, and I-I thought I'd just go home and try to get some sleep.
Please, please, Alex.
Poor little Mama, she want to see America before she die.
Latka, I'm sorry, I'd like to help, but I'm really very tired.
I mean, uh Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
It's Tony's day off today.
Hey, Tony, can I ask you a question?
Sure.
Please.
Mama, my mama!
Oh, Latka.
What did you want to ask me, Alex?
Huh?
Oh, how you doing?
Good.
Yeah, it was nice talking to you.
I think I got a date for breakfast.
What are you going to have?
Well, something American.
What have you?
Uh, pizza, spaghetti, chili and the special of the day is chop suey.
Yes.
Why don't you bring us a couple of hamburgers, Tommy?
Coming right up.
So, Mrs. Gravas, when did you get into New York?
This morning.
Have seen nothing.
Hear much about New York City.
Oh?
Many things want to see.
Yeah?
Like what?
Oh, garbage strike, blackout, urban blight.
I'll find out when the next tour is.
Oh, also want to see Yankee Dog Stadium.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you shouldn't miss that.
You know, you talk very good English.
You, too.
I learn English from phrase book.
Well, you learned your phrases very well.
Oh, you're welcome.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You're welcome from me, too.
Oh, try this.
No thirsty.
Mrs. Gravas, I, um, I hope this isn't too personal, but, uh, you know, I was really very surprised to see how young you are.
Oh, my, my, you're welcome.
I marry Latka's father when 15.
He killed two years later.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, you're welcome.
He die in struggle for liberty and freedom.
Oh, he was a freedom fighter shot by police?
No, he was a police shot by freedom fighter.
I, uh, I just can't believe that you never remarried.
I mean, you really are a very, uh, attractive woman.
And you're a very nice man, Mr. Reiger.
Well, thank you, Mrs. Gravas.
I am Greta.
Okay, I'm Alex.
Like Alexander?
Right.
What?
In my country, Alexander mean one who makes nik-nik during harvest.
Well, that's me all right.
And, uh, what does Greta mean?
Oh, means pretty.
It fits.
And yours fits, too.
It's not even harvest.
Ha, ha.
Hi, everybody.
Hi, Latka.
Hi.
How are you, Mama?
Mmm.
Mm.
I can only stay a minute because many cabs are broke.
Oh, Alex this is for you-- two tickets to Rockettes.
Mm.
I was going to take Mama, but, uh, so busy.
Rockets?
Oh, no, no, no.
Eh   So you use them, Alex.
Well, thank you very much, Latka.
Right.
You can take girlfriend.
What about your mother?
She don't have a girlfriend.
So tell me, Mama, how is Grishmel?
Oh, eh and how is Triska?
Oh  Eh, how is Schmopsy?
Schmopsy cookypoots.
Oh.
How is Lurgid?
Oh!
It's always nice to get the news from home.
How come every time I get an apple out of the machine, it's old and mushy?
Don't they ever put any new apples in this machine?
Uh, yeah, they put new apples in that machine, uh, but in order to get to the new apples, you have to eat the old apples first, be-because the old apples are so old, very few people eat them.
So, by the time you get to the new apples, they're old apples.
So then all we gotta do is eat more apples.
We'll eat right through the old ones and get to the new ones.
Except that if we all start to eat the old apples, the apple man will think we like old apples and he'll never put any new apples in the machine.
So then how do we get new apples, John?
We can't.
Hi.
Hey, Alex.
How did your date go with Latka's mama?
It wasn't a date.
Latka had these tickets to a show, so I went and, uh, she went.
It was sort of like, you know, uh, two people being at the same place at the same time, uh, together.
That's all.
Well, whatever it was, how did it go?
Fine, just fine.
She sure is attractive.
Who?
Oh, Mrs. Gravas?
Yeah.
Gee, imagine having a mother who's that good-looking.
You guys talking about me?
You?
Yeah, my mom's good-looking.
Very handsome figure of a woman.
If she'd just stop wearing those black dresses all the time shed a few pounds get rid of the wart and the mustache.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
Hey.
Hey, uh, Elaine, you got a minute?
Sure.
Um, I want, I want to ask you something.
I, um Elaine, listen.
What would, uh what would you think of a guy who, uh kind of got friendly with the mother of a buddy of his?
Oh, that depends how friendly.
Shockingly friendly.
Offhand, I'd say it was a pretty crummy thing to do.
No, no, wait, now listen, um What if, what if the guy didn't plan it?
You know what I mean?
What if it just sort of happened?
In fact, what if the mother, well, uh forced herself on the guy?
Forced herself?
Yeah.
I mean, what'd she do, like throw him down and pin him to the floor?
Kind of, yeah.
Elaine, listen, uh I'm talking about me and Latka's mother.
Latka's mother?
!
Uh yeah.
She flew in yesterday from the old country.
Just for that?
Huh?
No, no, no.
She flew in to see Latka.
Wow!
You and Latka's mother!
Please.
How old is she?
About six-foot-three.
Look, she-she happens to be a very attractive woman.
Look, Latka gave us tickets to a show.
We went to the Radio City Music Hall, and afterwards out for a bite to eat and she wanted to come up to my place for a drink.
Well, look,Oh, now no, I had no idea what was gonna happen.
I mean, I don't think she did either.
Just one of those things, you know what I mean?
You mean, you actually Elaine, I couldn't help it.
I really couldn't help it.
After we were alone for a while, she turned into an animal.
A great one.
She started to rip my shirt.
She ripped my raincoat.
Latka's mother?
!
Quiet, will you?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Look, there-there's no reason for you to feel guilty.
I don't, but it just bothers me that if Latka found out about it, it would really hurt him.
Oh, well, that's simple.
If I were you, I'd just make sure he never finds out.
Hmm.
Alex?
Alex Reiger?
If I were you, I'd think of something else.
Um Alex, I must talk to you man-to-face.
Yes.
Yes, Latka.
Last night, Mama come home very late.
Yes, I-I know.
I know.
And I ask her where she been.
She did not want to tell me, but I make her.
She told you everything?
Everything.
Oh, listen, Latka, please, I can explain.
You don't need to explain Daddy.
I think we really have to talk about this, Latka.
You know, Alex, if there was anyone in the world for me to choose for my father, I would choose you.
Oh, well, that's really very nice.
Latka, come over here and pick up your work order.
Okay, coming, Louie.
See you later, Papa.
Hey, Alex, you and Latka's mother getting serious?
Of course not.
Hello, Alexander.
It's not what you're thinking.
No, it's probably a lot better.
Uh, You guys got something better to do?
No.
Then do it!
We are going to be so happy together.
Mama cook, Alex read paper, I mow the lawn, oh  Can I have a puppy?
Latka, what you speak?
I no marry Alex.
No, no, no, of course not.
Look, Latka, your mother's is a wonderful woman, but I I don't want to marry her.
What!
No marry?
No,  But, Mama, if you play nik-nik with Alex, then you must marry.
It's the only way to save the family honor.
Oh, goat droppings.
No marry.
No goat droppings.
You you must.
No.
Yes.
No.
If you don't marry Alex, then you're you're a kakbort.
Mama!
Latka,    I'm sorry, Mama.
Ooh  It's okay, Alex.
Oh, uh, what did you tell him?
She told me how lonely she'd been since father died and I forgive her.
Hey, that's terrific, Latka.
But you, Mr. Reiger, you, I never forgive.
We are no longer friends.
Sorry, Alex.
Latka Latka, Latka.
Look!
I don't know what's exactly going on here, Reiger, and I don't want to make a judgment about who's right and who's wrong.
But I just want you to remember one thing: My mother's off-limits.
Hello, Latka.
Hello.
I was looking all over for you.
That so?
How you doing?
What's it to me?
Can I sit down?
Free country.
Latka, I think we have to talk.
I know what you're going to say.
I wanted to say that, um I'm deeply sorry that you were hurt by what happened between your mother and me.
I knew it.
Look, Latka, what your mother and I did was indiscreet.
You mean, not even indoors?
No, no, no, no, no.
Latka, look, what I'm trying to say is that I know through your eyes what happened between your mother and me was wrong.
But what happened between a woman by the name of Greta Gravas and me was not wrong.
May I?
What is that?
Brefinish.
I make myself.
Make a good anti-freeze, let me tell you.
No, eats eats the pipes.
Oh!
Look, Latka, Latka, what do you say What do you say we just shake hands, okay?
Okay.
Then we're friends again?
No, no, not friends.
We just shook hands, that makes us friends, doesn't it?
Not in my country.
Only one thing means friendship between two men-- when they do this to each other.
I guess that seems a lot friendlier than shaking hands.
Latka, why can't you forgive me?
Because you have shamed the name of Gravas.
Was it that bad?
Look, why you do this?
I would not do it to your mother.
My mother's 67 years old.
Then not do for sure.
Latka, look, I like you.
I to be friends with you again.
Well, I like you, too, Alex, but we can never be friends.
What are you talking about?
We work in the same place.
We see each other every day.
Come on, you'll get over this.
Of course we can be friends again.
No.
You mean to say that we'll never go to breakfast with each other ever again?
Never.
We'll never be able to play poker together ever again?
Never.
You'll never come to my house to watch football?
No, never.
Not even when the Dallas cheerleaders are on?
I sorry, Alex, we cannot be friends.
It's a question of honor.
Without honor, a man is nothing.
I'm sorry, but this is how it must be.
There's nothing I can do to change that?
Nothing.
Well, I guess that's it, then.
Good-bye, Latka.
Good-bye.
Wait!
Maybe is one solution.
What?
You and I could globnik.
What?
Well, is custom in my country, when two friends cannot agree, they globnik.
Well, what does that mean?
It's hard to explain.
Here, look it up.
Globnik?
Globnik.
Glbonik.
Garfnog, giffort glab, globnik.
Here it is, globnik.
"From glob, to disappear.
"Intransitive verb.
To pretend or assume some event or occurrence never took place".
You think that would do it?
I mean, just pretend it never happened?
Pretend what never happened?
Beats me.
Me, too.
Well, back to work.
Yep, I'll, um I'll, I'll see you.
Okay, bye.
Okay, Latka, your deal.
Thank you very much.
Latka love poker.
Abbee, abbee, abbee, abbee, dabbee, dabbee, dabbee, dabbee, eicky, eicky, eicky, eicky, bicky, bicky, bicky, bicky, eh sappee, sappee, sappee, sappee.
I'll take dabbee.
Okay, uh, abbee, dabbee.
Give me dabbee.
Abbee, dabbee.
Eicky for me.
Abbee, dabbee, eicky.
And dealer take bicky.
Abbee, dabbee, eicky, bicky.
Okay, I open one kripkee.
I'm in.
I see your kripkee and I raise a kebel.
Okay, big shots, I see you and raise ten kebels.
Hey, get this, Latka.
I bet he's drawing to an inside rebelyek.
I'll see that.
Yeah, yeah, I'm in.
Call.
Okay.
What you got, Bobby?
Yeah, what do you got, Bobby?
A pair of dorfnickis.
I just missed my royal pipik.
All right, three yadabis.
Hold it!
A full flerm.
Full ferm?
Good night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
LOUIE : Resnick, you got cab 529.
Capasso cab 111.
Come on, let's get out of here and get some breakfast.
I'm hungry.
Good idea.
Let's go.
Hey, listen, Louie, when Alex comes in would you just tell him we're at Mario's?
He won't be in for a while.
Hamill, 120.
How come?
He got shot.
What?
!
De la Grazzi What do you mean, he got shot, Louie?
What happened?
Some guy robbed him and shot him.
Lucia, 338.
For God's sakes, Louie, where is he?
Is he all right?
Is he alive?
Last time I talked to him, he was.
They took him to Mt.
Sinai.
Liebowitz, 226.
Louie, how can you just sit there like that?
I mean, come on!
Don't you care about Alex?
Aren't you worried about him?
Of course I care about him.
What kind of heel you think I am?
Drago, 829.
Come on, let's go to the hospital.
Come on.
You're a sick person.
Huh.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Huh?
Louie said you got shot.
Yeah, I did.
Well, are you okay?
Huh?
Are you okay?
Of course he's okay.
The bullet just nicked his ear.
Yeah, it was just a scratch.
I'm fine, really.
That's all?
Oh, the doctor said that since the gun went off close to my ear, that I might have a little trouble hearing every now and then.
But I don't seem to notice anything.
So, there's nothing else wrong?
Huh?
No, it didn't take long.
He just put a bandage here and let me go.
It's okay.
Boy, you were really lucky.
I'll say.
Yeah.
What?
Boy, you were really lucky.
I'll say.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, it was really crazy.
You know, I-I just let this guy off, and all of a sudden, he sticks a gun in my face.
Oh He asked me to give him all my money.
I told him that most of it was locked in a strongbox and I didn't have the key.
He didn't buy that.
So, uh then I heard him cock the gun.
I mean, I really got frightened.
I didn't know what to do.
So, I stepped on the gas, the gun went off, and, zing.
You know.
That is scary.
Boy, you read about these things happening all the time, but you never think it's going to happen to you.
What makes you think it was a Jew?
Oh, uh, just a hunch.
Well, listen, I-I'm going to go home and get some sleep.
I'll see you guys later, okay?
Okay.
Alex?
Yeah, take it easy, man.
You know what?
Don't come in tomorrow.
I mean, why don't you just take a couple days off?
You know, rest, relax.
Oh, thanks.
I got them on sale.
You like them?
Huh?
Alex?
Yeah?
Why don't you take a couple days off?
I mean, an experience like this has got to have an effect on you.
No, no, no, no.
I'm fine, Elaine.
I really am.
You know the old saying-- you fall off a horse, you got to get right back on.
Yeah, but I don't know if the same old saying applies to getting shot off a horse.
Oh, Elaine, I'm okay.
Really, I'm okay.
Believe me.
Hey-hey, Alex, did you get a good look at the guy who shot you?
Oh, all I saw was his big gun.
Oh, yeah, he had a word tattooed across his fist-- "kill".
Never, never pick up any people with tattoos.
That's a cardinal rule.
They're all morons, maniacs and lowlifes.
Hey, Louie, I got a tattoo.
Oh, yeah, and losers.
LOUIE : Hey, Alex.
Yeah, Louie?
You all right?
Yeah, sure, Louie.
Are you certain?
No, it's not hurting a bit.
I'm okay.
Look, Alex, I know you must be feeling a little nervous after what happened last night, so I don't want you to feel any pressure.
Don't pick up anybody who don't look right to you and stay out of the bad neighborhoods.
If you don't book so good, it don't matter to me.
Well, thanks, Louie.
All right, Nardo, I read your crummy speech.
Now where's my five dollars?
Uh, look, Elaine, Elaine, please don't worry about me.
It's no big deal, huh?
Taxi!
Sorry, off duty.
I'll pick up the next one.
MAN #2: Cab!
Next one that doesn't have a safety pin through his nose.
MAN #3: Taxi!
Good evening, Father.
Front Street by Pier Six, please.
What church is down there?
I don't know.
I-I don't think there is one.
That's a pretty desolate area at night.
Guess you must have your reasons for going there, huh?
Uh-huh.
You seem sort of, uh, young to be a priest.
You been one long?
Uh-uh.
Uh, Louie, this is Alex, listen I'm busy!
Call back in an hour.
That's my dispatcher.
We keep in constant contact here, you know.
You know say, a couple of guys down at the garage and I were having this little argument, you know.
Maybe you can clear it up for me, uh, Father.
Um yeah, we had this big fight about who the 12 Apostles were, and, uh, I figured, uh you being a priest, why, you'd know, right?
You had a fight over the 12 Apostles?
Yeah.
I bet you could rattle off their names in nothing flat.
Would you do that for me, Father?
Rattle them off in nothing flat?
I suppose so, if you like.
Uh, let's see uh, Peter, Matthew, Judas, Andrew James the younger, James the elder, Bartholomew Simon That's eight.
John.
Do you really need to know this?
It would mean a lot to me and the guys at the garage Father.
Thomas and Jude.
One more.
Did I say Andrew?
Yeah, you said Andrew already.
Well, it's not Sneezy.
No, I don't think it is Sneezy.
I'm sorry, I don't remember.
All right, get out of the cab!
What?
I said get out of the cab!
Get out of the cab!
Try it on some other sucker.
Get out of here I'll call the cops!
I'll call the cops!
Wow, that was a close one.
Boy, that's really something.
Everybody's totally paranoid after what happened to Alex last night.
They're all stealing Latka's tools for weapons.
It's crazy.
What'd you get?
A wrench.
Uh, in my opinion, the best weapon is reasonable communication.
The tongue is mightier than the sword.
Talk like that's a good way to get your tongue cut off.
I heard about this guy once who faked a heart attack while he was getting mugged.
Scared the mugger off.
You know, I could do that.
Uh, you'd have to be pretty convincing.
Hey, I'm an actor, man.
You know, I can convince anybody of anything, you know.
Yeah?
Yeah, you want to see a heart attack?
Yeah.
All right.
Okay, heart attack.
Oh  What's the matter with you?
: I'm having a heart attack.
Well, have it somewheres else.
I could've tripped and broke my neck.
See?
I convinced him.
Yeah.
Play some rummy?
Yeah.
Let me get my Hi, Alex.
Hey, Alex, how's your ear?
How do you feel?
You booked absolutely nothing?
That's not too good, Alex.
I quit.
You're not used to criticism, are you?
Look, Louie, I had a lot of time to think about this last night.
I see you had a lot of time.
I don't want to drive a cab anymore.
Alex Alex!
Huh?
Come in here.
What do you want?
Come over here.
What are you talking about?
You can't quit.
You're my best booker.
Louie, I almost got killed the other night.
One guy out of a city of eight million tries to blow your brains out, you want to make a federal case out of it.
Now look, Louie, I'm serious.
I quit.
Rieger, you leave, it's costing me a lot of money.
Ah!
But that doesn't matter.
Because who cares about money when people's personal feelings are involved?
Now, how's this going to affect your fellow drivers?
Next to me, they look up to you more than anyone else in here.
Now, how are you going to break the news to them?
I don't know.
I thought I'd do something like this.
Hey, everybody, I'm quitting.
What?
!
What for?
What are you talking about What do you mean?
Well, it's very simple.
I'm scared.
Well, sure, you're a little scared.
I mean, after what happened the other night No, John, I'm not just a little scared.
I'm a little scared of spiders and snakes, but driving a cab terrifies me.
Well, what about what you said about climbing back on the horse?
Yeah, well, me and Old Paint didn't book a dime last night.
Alex, listen, I can really understand what you're going through, but quitting, man, is crazy.
Well, picking up total strangers in the middle of the night and driving wherever they tell you to isn't exactly sane.
Who does that?
We do.
Oh, yeah.
Quitting!
The man is quitting.
Well, maybe I'm using the word "man" too loosely.
You're a lily-livered, yellow-bellied, namby-pamby, mealymouth chicken!
You're right, Louie.
Can't reason with the guy.
I still don't believe what I'm hearing.
Alex, you've been driving a cab for ten years.
What are you going to do if you quit, huh?
There are a lot of things I could do.
Yeah, like what?
I used to be an upholsterer.
I could go back to doing that.
Oh, whoopie-doo.
Tending bar-- I did that for a while.
Yeah, well, they get held up, too, you know.
I was a waiter once.
That's a possibility.
Oh, exciting.
You could make cheese.
Why would I want to do that?
Somebody has to.
Yeah, good point.
Look, I'm not worried about finding a job.
Yeah, but Alex, you like driving.
Well, who wouldn't?
It's a great job.
You're outside cruising in the fresh air.
You wear what you want, you work when you want.
It's the kind of job you can really make out without killing yourself.
Yeah, somebody else will do that for you.
Look, I've thought about this a lot, and I've come to the conclusion my life is worth more than 55 cents a mile.
Now, I can't handle it anymore, and that's it.
Wow, we're all really going to miss you.
Yeah, it's it's going to be weird around here without you.
It sure is.
Hey, come on, we'll keep in touch.
I'll drop by, you'll drop by.
I mean, you know how it goes.
I mean, a guy leaves the neighborhood, you see him more than when he lived next door.
You know that.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, we'll still be tight, right?
Sure.
Right.
Right.
Okay.
I, uh Oh Please!
I'm going to hate myself in the morning.
Well, I guess I'll see you Okay.
Are we ready to order?
I think so.
Uh, how's your escargot?
My car goes fine, why do you ask?
Is there something wrong with your hearing?
I'm sorry, we don't serve herring, but I can recommend the escargot.
Fine, uh, just bring us those, and we'll decide on our entree later.
Very good, sir.
Wow, Alex said he was working at a posh place, but I never expected anything like this.
Good evening.
Yes, reservations for Dr. Wheeler.
Ah, yes, Dr. Wheeler, party of four, yes?
Yes.
Follow me Doctor.
I'll show you to your table.
Dr. Wheeler?
Well, it's easier to get reservations at joints like this if they think you're a doctor.
So, uh, how'd that heart job go this morning, Doc?
Madame.
Bon appetit.
Merci.
Touché.
Will you stop trying to embarrass me, huh?
What did I do?
What do you?
Hey, look at all the silverware they give you here.
Isn't this great?
Good evening.
My name is Richard.
I'll be serving you this evening.
Are you the waiter for this table?
Yes.
Then we'd like to sit somewhere else.
Excuse me.
Um, I'm sure you're an excellent waiter.
However, we know another waiter from the establishment at which he worked formerly.
And, um, Alex Rieger is his name.
We would very much like for him to serve us.
I hope you understand.
Not entirely.
But I'll get him.
Oh, thank you so much.
Why am I talking like the Queen of England?
Hey, you know, I've been to some pretty great places in my life, but this place beats them all.
There ain't even no gum stuck to this table.
Will you put it?
Uh, good evening.
My name is Alex.
Hey, Alex!
Oh!
Hi, Alex!
You look really terrific.
Do I?
huh?
Oh, yeah, cummerbunds become you.
Here, pull up a chair.
Oh, no, thanks, Tony, I can't.
I have six tables to take care of.
I have to be kind of mobile, if you know what I mean.
Well, we just thought we'd stop by, you know, say hello, and have a bite.
Yes, it's really great to see you people.
Um, like me to get you something to drink?
Yeah, I'd love a brew.
Oh.
So, how's it going?
Very well, Tony.
Very well.
Listen, why don't I buy you a bottle of wine, huh?
What do you say?
Oh Oh Hey What do you like?
Red?
White?
Rosé?
White rosé would be great.
Okay.
An excellent choice, Tony.
Yeah, and bring some peanuts.
Right.
I can't believe Alex is doing this.
It's hard to keep a straight face.
He seems to like it here okay, huh?
Yeah.
Wow, he must be cleaning up.
of coffee is a great tip.
Hmm!
Here we are.
Oh.
Hmm?
Whoo, that's nice, Alex.
Would you like me to open it now?
No, don't bother, we'll do it ourselves.
That's okay, Tony.
It's okay.
Alex?
Yes?
Alex, is, uh, this really awkward for you?
What, you people coming here and my having to wait on you?
Uh-huh.
Yes, it's as awkward as hell.
Hey, would you feel better if we left?
Now, truth.
Oh, come on, I'm just kidding.
Hey, come on.
You're my friends.
Don't be silly.
Besides, I understand you people are going to be great tippers.
Hey, uh, Alex?
Hmm?
I think it's ladies first.
Oh.
Thanks for your help, Tony.
Waiter.
Mmm.
Mmm?
: It's wonderful.
Waiter?
Uh, I'd like to propose a toast.
Waiter.
Will you keep your drawers on, lady?
The guy's got six tables.
He can't be everywhere at once.
I just wanted some water.
Listen, I'll be right back.
You happy?
It's okay, Alex.
I took care of it.
Oh, thank you.
Uh all right.
How are we?
We're doing good.
Hey, let's, uh, have a toast.
Oh, yeah, okay.
Oh, yeah, anyway to our good friend, Alex.
Oh, please.
And one good waiter, too, if you ask me.
Hear, hear.
Thank you, thank you, folks.
Okay, are we ready to order?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Um, let's see, I'm gonna st I'll have the spinach salad.
Oh, listen, I'll split one with you.
Just put extra bacon bits on my half, all right?
Okay.
Gee, it seems such a shame not to order French food in a French restaurant.
Uh, tell me uh, how are the potatoes au gratin prepared?
With cheese.
Very interesting.
That's what I think I'll have-- potatoes au gratin, with cheese.
What the heck.
Give me the potatoes au gratin-- only without the cheese.
Okay, let's see if I've got this right, now.
That's, uh, pheasant pate, vichyssoise, endive salad, duck a l'orange chocolate mousse and espresso all for four.
Alex, what are?
It's on me.
Aw, Alex, we can't let you do that.
Are you kidding?
Listen, I make almost twice as much here as I did at the garage.
Now, it's on me, and that's all there is to it.
Well, gee, I mean, like, well thanks.
You're welcome.
You know, Alex, uh I guess we all came here tonight sort of hoping it wasn't working out for you as a waiter.
And you know, maybe you'd come back to the garage.
But I-I guess there's no chance of that, huh?
You know, strangely enough, I was laying awake last night thinking about whether or not I should go back to driving a cab.
Really?
Great!
Hold on.
I said I was thinking about it-- just thinking.
I mean, you know, I was trying to weigh what's good about being a waiter against what's good about being a cab driver.
You know, I, um I do make a lot more bread here.
Oh Yeah.
But on the other hand, being a cab driver, I'm my own boss.
I mean, nobody orders me around, you know.
Nobody goes like this to me.
That's right.
Right.
That's important.
Self-respect, you know.
However, on the other hand being a waiter, nobody goes like this to me.
Oh, yeah, but that's one in a million.
Big deal.
One time, you know?
Of course, as a cab driver, I can I don't have to dress up like this.
I mean, uh I can wear what I want, shave when I want.
Yeah, you hate shaving.
YeahThat's right.
Besides, you look pretty fruity Of course, the hours are really much better here, you know.
I get to go home at midnight, and I sleep at night.
But of course, you know, as a cab driver, my time is my own.
I mean, I feel like working, I work.
I don't feel like working, I don't work.
That's great.
That's right.
Exactly why I took the job You know something?
I do get great gourmet meals here free.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right, so But you know, the great thing about being a cab driver?
You can be yourself.
I mean, you don't have to smile at everybody.
All they get is the back of my head.
What I do with my face is my own business.
So, you see what I mean?
I mean, both have their advantages, both have their disadvantages.
See what I mean?
Yeah, but, Alex, you know, you're forgetting one thing.
What's that?
Friends.
Oh.
Yes.
You're right, Bobby.
I've made wonderful friends here at the restaurant.
Joker!
You see, so I say to myself, what's it going to be?
Waiter cab driver.
Waiter cab driver Alex, thank you.
Everything was excellent.
This is for you.
Wow!
A $20 tip.
This is very depressing.
It's okay, Alex.
We understand.
No, because I just decided.
I'm a cab driver.
Cabby Alex!
They love the appetizer.
LOUIE : Just remember, Alex.
This is your first night back.
Don't pick up anybody who looks suspicious.
Now, listen, Louie, it's not going to work that way.
I'm going to drive the way I always drive.
Anybody who flags me, I'm going to pick them up.
Anywhere they want to go, that's fine.
I mean, I'm going to go crazy if I spend my life trying to figure out who's safe, who isn't safe.
Look, it's a dangerous business.
I'll just have to live with it, okay?
Okay.
Sorry, off duty.
Aw, what the heck.
Might as well take a chance.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
So, what are you and Suzanne doing for Christmas, John?
Oh, her parents are having a party.
How about you?
Oh, I don't know.
Last year, I went to a sit-down dinner for 80 people.
Yeah, they got this really long counter at Woolworth's.
Merry Christmas, Elaine.
Hey, how you doing, Elaine?
Come on.
I'll take three.
What's the matter with Elaine?
Oh, I think it has something to do with her ex-husband picks up the girls this morning.
This is the first Christmas she's ever spent alone.
Poor thing.
What a bummer.
I'd go crazy if I had to spend Christmas alone.
You are spending Christmas alone.
I am?
Well, he gave us fair warning.
$35?
You call this a day's booking?
Sorry, Louie.
What's the matter with her?
You wouldn't understand, Louie.
Some people just feel sad at Christmas.
Oh, yeah?
You think I don't know that?
I got feelings.
Really?
My mother's that way.
Cries every Christmas on account of my little brother Nicky never comes to see her.
I'll give you the same advice I give my mom when she cries.
I say, "Ma, shut up".
I always knew you could be tender.
Yeah, only this year, I ain't going to have any problems with Ma because Nicky's breaking with tradition.
Oh, you mean your brother is coming to town?
Due in today.
I'm expecting him any minute.
I told you about him.
Big-time poker player, lives in Las Vegas.
Yeah, right.
Always says he's too busy to come East.
Only this year he was in Atlantic City to catch the action.
I talked him into stopping by for a few days.
You know, every Christmas Eve for the past six years Ma stayed up all night crying.
It was really hard on me.
I'll bet.
Yeah, I hated having to put her out in the hall.
Nick!
Louie!
You made it, Nick!
My little brother.
Hey, everybody, this is my little brother, Nicky.
Ooh, I can't believe you're here.
Come here.
I want to introduce you to some of my inferiors.
Nah, we'll do that later.
Six years I haven't seen you.
Let me look at you.
New coat, huh?
Ma can't wait to see you.
She couldn't talk about anything else since she found out you were coming.
Right.
Hey, is that a poker game?
Relax.
I already told them you're a pro.
Now, listen, the sleeping arrangements are going to be a little tricky because, you see, we only have two beds, but Ma has trouble sleeping anyway, so she can sit up and you can have hers.
Nicky, we're going to have such a good time.
Right, right, right.
How about me sitting in on a few hands, huh?
Hey, Nick, Nicky, don't you hear what I'm saying?
Nicky, Ma's been waiting to see you for six years.
So, she can wait a few minutes.
It won't hurt her.
I ain't fooling with you this time, Nicky.
Get up there.
Hey, Jeff, get a cab and take my brother to see my mother.
Come on, Louie.
Don't push.
I'm not pushing.
Now, get the hell out of here!
I'm going, I'm going.
Just don't lose all that Christmas tip money.
I want a crack at it.
I know it's none of my business, Louie, but, uh, your brother didn't seem so anxious to visit your mother.
I know.
It worries me, Alex.
He hurts her bad.
Huh?
He never shows her any affection or consideration.
Like me, I'm always saying stuff like, "How you doing, Ma"?
You know?
She cooks something, and I don't like the way it tastes, I never spit it out.
I always tell her, "Take another crack at it".
But listen, I want to tell you something.
This is just between you and me.
The winters have been getting really hard on Ma, and she freezes up on me, Oh.
you know?
And she needs to go someplace where it's warm so she can thaw out.
You know, like Las Vegas.
Yeah.
Now, here's Nick-- he's got this beautiful apartment out there.
You think he ever asked her once to come out and visit?
No.
Now, what I'm hoping is he's going to go home and see how bad off she is and then get the idea himself and ask her.
That'd be swell, but from what I saw, I wouldn't count on it, Louie.
No, I'm not, I'm not.
That's why I told Ma, you know, drop a few subtle hints.
Now that'd be an idea.
Yeah, like I told her to tell him, "Nicky, I'd really love to see your apartment in Vegas "before I die, because if I don't I'll put a curse on you from my grave".
* Joy to the world, the Lord is come * * let Earth receive her King * Look at this.
* Let every heart prepare Him room * * And heaven and nature sing * and heaven and nature sing * And heaven and nature sing * Come on, give him a buck, everybody.
* Let Earth receive her King * Let every heart prepare Him room * * And heaven and nature sing * And heaven and nature sing * And heaven and nature sing * Joy to the world Here's your cut, Mr. De Palma.
Thanks for letting us work the garage.
Okay, Merry Christmas.
All right, now keep practicing because I might have a New Year's eve gig for you.
Hey, I was just thinking.
Why don't we have a little Christmas party?
Where?
Right here in the garage.
You know, why not?
We never had one here before.
How come?
I don't know tradition?
Hey, wait a minute.
That might not be such a bad idea.
Sure.
I can make some egg nog.
I'm not going to be able to cook but I could stop at a deli.
That's fine, that's fine.
I'll get some Christmas decorations.
Right.
I'm sure even Louie will give me a break on the choir.
And you know what?
I'm going to get a Christmas tree so we can put all of our gifts underneath it.
I just hope you guys like what I got you.
What's wrong?
You do exchange Christmas gifts, don't you?
We do now.
Yeah, sure.
Okay, well, I'm going to make some phone calls and I'll set it up.
Okay, everybody, okay.
Come here round the table.
Let's go.
Who's the cashier around this joint, huh?
Nick!
What are you doing back here?
You're supposed to be seeing Ma.
I saw Ma-- we had a little chat.
You had a good idea me coming.
I'm glad I did it.
Hey, deal me in.
Don't deal him in.
You only been gone ten minutes.
It takes ten minutes to drive there and back.
What'd you expect, me to spend all afternoon with her?
Deal me in.
Don't deal him in.
I want to talk to you.
I got a poker game to play, Louie.
I want to talk to you now.
Get in the cage.
Excuse us.
Get in there.
Watch my coat, huh?
I'll watch the coat.
Sit down.
You're a rotten kid, Nick.
Six years you're gone.
You don't call, you don't write.
Nothing.
You come back for a crummy five minutes.
Ain't you got no feelings for Ma at all?
Sunshine cab.
Hey, crazy lady, give me a break here.
It's Ma.
I'm talking to him now.
What?
She says she asked you about going to Vegas and you laughed in her face.
I thought she was joking.
What am I going to do with Ma in Las Vegas?
Stop screaming, will you?
!
I can't talk to her when she's like this.
Ma, I can't talk to you when you're like this.
Alex, come in here and talk to my mother.
What, me?
Come on, just take the phone.
Hey, Louie, I don't know what to say to your mother.
You don't have to say anything, just listen.
Hello, Mrs. De Palma?
This is Alex Rieger, one of your son's employees.
No, Mrs. De Palma, I don't know why people have children.
Look, Nick, I've given you your way for a long time.
I've been with Ma.
I'm taking care of her.
I never asked you for no help.
Well, maybe I haven't said so, but I always thought that was big of you.
Nicky was a difficult birth, huh?
No, no, please.
Mrs. De Palma, don't tell me all the medical details.
I'm really not a medical man, please.
Look, you're taking Ma to Vegas and that's that.
I told you, I can't.
Give me one good reason.
I don't want to.
Nicky used to pull the what off flies?
All right, this is your last chance.
You either take Ma with you when you go, or you leave town an only child.
I'm not your brother anymore.
Okay, Louie.
Have it your way.
We're not brothers anymore.
Hey, deal me in.
You want to talk to Nicky?
Nick.
Louie, Louie, I'm sorry.
Ma!
Ma, you're going to Vegas, I promise.
I'm not lying.
Have I lied to you yet?
I mean this phone call.
No, trust me, then.
I swear you're going to Vegas.
How you going to keep a promise like that?
I don't know, Alex, but I got to.
You hear the way she screeches?
Sometimes when she's going real good, dogs come from all over.
I just have to keep that promise.
Thanks for coming, Alex.
I knew I could count on you if I called you.
You're a real pal.
Yeah.
What are you having?
Um, I'll have a beer.
Separate tabs.
So, how's the party going?
Oh, you'd hate it, Louie.
There's joy everywhere.
Nick still around?
Yep, and winning big.
You know, I been doing a lot of thinking, Alex, about Ma, about me, about Nick, about Ma and me, about Nick and me, about Nick and Ma.
Thank goodness you don't have a bigger family.
You know, Christmas has always been a stinking time of the year for me.
Oh, come on, Louie.
Always!
Do you know that I played the elf in the Christmas pageant every year till I left for the Army?
Yeah, I know.
I never got to play the parts that I wanted to play-- angel, shepherd, room clerk The guy who said, "No room at the Inn".
Oh, that room clerk.
Alex, Louie.
Hi, John.
Excuse me.
Listen, I was just on my way to my in-laws' house for the party and I wanted to drop by and wish you a Merry Christmas.
Maybe this is the wrong time.
Huh?
No, no, it's okay, John.
Hey, how did you do at the poker table?
Got cleaned out.
Boy, that brother of yours can really play poker.
He's cleaning everybody.
Yeah, I'm glad I'm not playing.
That does it.
It's bad enough he's ruining Christmas for me and Ma.
He's got to ruin it for everybody else.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I want to get even with him.
I would too.
I want to hit him where it hurts the most.
And I want you to help me.
Me?
Yeah.
You're the best poker player in the company, Alex.
Well I want you to challenge Nick and beat him at his own game.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Now, Nick's a pro.
I can't beat him.
Even if I could, it would take a lot of money to bankroll a challenge like that.
I got the money.
It's my life savings.
I been socking away money for years.
I've always wanted to use it for something special-- a trip to Florida, a new car Revenge!
I want him wiped out, Alex crushed, destroyed, humiliated for Ma.
Louie, what do you think?
About what?
Nick.
Hey, Louie, I knew you couldn't stay mad at me forever.
Great party.
Great bunch of guys, too.
From now on, I'm coming back more often.
That's a promise.
Nick, Nick.
Alex, yo.
Alex wants to play one on one with you.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, Alex, hey, are you sure?
I mean, like, he's really good.
I mean, he's really good, you know what I mean?
Hey, what do you mean?
I mean, what's one on one?
Does that mean we can't play anymore?
It means that we've lost enough already.
You lost enough-- I haven't.
Hey, I'll cut you for 20.
Ace.
Now I lost enough.
Hey, could I have my shoes back?
Yeah, but you can only borrow them till I'm done here.
Okay, Alex.
Oh yeah, right.
You get him.
We're all behind you, all right?
Don't worry about it.
Okay, how much you playing with?
Alex isn't playing with his money.
He's playing with mine.
You're bankrolling him against me, your own brother?
Jeez, Louie, I always knew you resented me and all of that but I never knew you had it in you to do something like this.
You're all right.
Hey, John, I thought you were going to your in-laws'.
Oh, I am.
I forgot and left Suzanne's present in my locker.
How's the game going?
They're just getting started.
Okay, well, we'll see you all in a couple days.
Merry Christmas again.
Merry Christmas.
I'm just going to call Suzanne and tell her I'm on my way.
All right, let's get started.
Only we're going to make some new rules this time.
Hello, honey, I'm just leaving the garage now, so could you ask your folks if they'd hold dinner for me?
All right.
No limit on the betting.
Alex, here's $3,000.
Maybe you better tell them to start without me.
Well, honey, Alex just raised another 20 Nick is smiling Nick calls Damn, Alex lost again.
That's the third time in a row.
Hey, Alex, how much you lost now?
None of your business, Banta.
About 1,100.
What are you-- a computer?
You guys been at this five hours now.
Couldn't we take a break?
They don't need a break.
I've seen Alex play ten, 12 hours in a row.
No, look, if Nick wants to take a break, I'll take a break.
I once played for Let's play.
Hey, 72 hours.
That's like my fight with Rocky Santocuore.
Your fight with Santocuore lasted four minutes.
I'm talking about my recovery.
I bet $500.
I like your style, kid.
I'll see your five and raise five.
$1,500 in one pile.
I don't believe it.
Hey, Alex, take it easy.
I will see your five.
And I will raise you Five.
This is unbelievable.
$2,500.
Alex, you better be sure.
I mean, you better be sure you're sure.
I'm going to find out.
I'll see it and raise you my last $300.
I'm all in.
Louie, I can't cover that.
Alex, look into my eyes and tell me that you're sure about this hand.
I mean, promise me you're sure.
Say you're positive.
I'm reasonably sure.
I'll get more money.
More money?
Where are you going to get more money?
Hey, Louie, where you going?
What are you going in there for?
You're going to bet the company receipts?
What the hell do you think you been playing with?
You said it was your life savings, Louie.
I lied-- I do that sometimes.
Louie, Louie Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie.
What do you mean, I'm playing with stolen money?
Yeah.
If you lose now, you're in big trouble.
All right.
That's fine.
Makes the game a lot more interesting.
He sees your bet, and raises you another $450.
Louie, I told you I was all in.
So fold.
You take a check?
Okay, you won't.
Here, my airline ticket.
It's worth $150.
What do you give me for a $300 watch?
$80.
Great, I only paid $50 for it.
Yeah?
That's $80, and 150 is $230.
I give that guy $20 for his shoes; that makes it $250.
I don't want his shoes.
I want my shoes.
It's Christmas, Louie, take his shoes.
Okay, but you're still $200 short.
Well, let me think.
Let me do it for you.
The way I figure it, three weeks for Ma in Vegas is worth $200.
You want me to bet Ma?
You win?
You're off the hook.
You lose?
You take her with you.
You're betting on our own mother.
Right.
$300, Two weeks.
That stinks.
Two weeks for $200.

{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Louie, this is Rieger in 264.
Just dropped off a fare from the airport at 79th and Park.
Got it.
By the way, Rieger, better be on the lookout.
It's a full moon.
You know what that means.
Every creep in this city will be out tonight.
Well, be sure to wear a jacket, Louie, it's getting chilly.
You think you're a real Jan Murray, don't you, Rieger?
Taxi!
Louie, I got a fare.
Get back to you.
Taxi!
Shea stadium, please.
There's no game tonight.
I didn't ask for the schedule, thank you.
Oh, that's Shea stadium, huh?
That's it.
You call that a ballpark?
Well, it looks better with the lights on.
Old Ebbets field looked good even in the dark.
Lady, I didn't build the place, I just Well, never mind, never mind.
Just take me to La Guardia airport.
I know a place at the end of one the runways where the big ones come down so close the lights shine right in the window and you can hear them lower their landing gear, they come down so close.
Hey, full moon  That's the closest one yet, Alex.
Yeah, I think he left some rubber on the roof.
I like you.
Most cab drivers want to talk.
They do nothing but ask me questions all night.
I know what you mean.
Do you do this often?
Oop!
That was a question, I'm sorry.
Aw, that's okay.
I do it every once in a while.
I love New York City.
I've lived here all my life.
I was at Woolworth's You should have used the express line.
Got you that time, huh?
I was a clerk on the candy counter.
Oh.
Say, why don't we drive past the store I used to work at, then you can take a look at it?
Is it on our way?
Everything is on our way.
Let's go.
Well, here's where I call home.
I had a very nice time.
You know something?
So did I. Yeah.
Well, why don't you pick me up here tomorrow night, say about 6:00-ish?
Oh, I'm sorry, Dee, I check into the garage around 5:00, 5:30, and I never know how long I have to wait for the day driver to bring in a cab I can use.
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, maybe I'll see you again sometime.
For sure.
How much do I owe you for the trip tonight?
Well, I warned you it was going to be high.
Uh $74.25.
Here.
Would you stop worrying?
Believe me, I'm comfortable.
In fact, I'm filthy comfortable.
On a Woolworth's pension?
No, you see, Alex, when I was young, girls my age were supposed to get married, but something told me not to, so I didn't, and then I went to work instead.
Just a few months before I was retiring, I met this very wealthy man.
He asked me to marry him, and, uh, something told me to accept.
Four months after the wedding, he died and he left me everything.
There's a moral in there somewhere.
Well, thank you, ma'am, it was very nice.
Yes.
Now, I'd like to give you a really good tip, Alex.
What's the best tip you ever got?
Well, a guy gave me $25 once.
Yeah.
Well here's $26.
Congratulations, Alex, you set a new record.
Well, thank you.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Yeah.
Hey, let me help you out.
Forget it.
Hey, Lou-- Hey, Lou, how about putting me in one of them clean cabs?
Man, you're always sticking me in pigpens.
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean.
You want me to explain it to you?
Yeah.
You got a minute?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Come here.
You see, it's like this: I don't give a rat's corpse whether you get a clean cab or not.
Oh okay.
Thanks for explaining it to me.
I enjoyed it.
It never fails, you know?
Every full moon I get people too crazy for Bellevue.
My very first fare last night was a guy who introduces himself as God.
Well, I had an interesting night myself.
Yeah, I picked up, uh, three drunks and a flasher two transvestites Oh, yeah, and one guy who thought I was the most beautiful woman in the world.
Just crazies like that shouldn't be allowed out on the streets.
Hey!
Yo, Alex!
Yo, ho, ho.
Hey, Alex, did you get any full moon crazies last night?
No, I lucked out.
I got this very charming old lady who just wanted to drive around and talk.
Oh, yeah?
You drove around all night and talked?
She tipped me 26 bucks.
For 26 bucks I'd drive around and sing "You Light Up My Life".
I know.
I'm eating.
So you are.
No I mean, I'm eating.
What are you talking about?
Well, last night I picked up a couple of rock musicians, and I think I'm still on my contact high.
I've had guys smoke powerful stuff in the back seat before, but nothing like this.
Come on, you still can't be high.
Oh, I hope I am, because the only thing I can think about is the fact that my hair is growing all the time.
I'd kill for a Twinkie.
Oh, Alex, there you are.
Hey, Dee, what are you doing here?
Oh, these must be your friends.
Don't tell me who they are.
I want to guess.
Uh, oh, you must be Elaine.
Yeah!
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I really admire you working two jobs, raising children.
That must be hard.
Yeah, it gets tough sometimes, you know?
But I got to a point in my life where I decided I either had to do this for myself or Alex, who am I spilling my guts out to?
I'm sorry, this is Dee Wilcox, the lady I drove around last night.
Your names came up in the conversation.
I feel I know you all.
I feel I like you all.
Whoever brought her in, get her out.
I bet you're Louie.
Am I right?
Sell it someplace else, sister.
I am right.
Alex, I got the perfect solution to our problem.
What problem?
Whenever I want to ride with you I'll catch a cab here.
No, Dee, this is crazy.
You know, sometimes I have to wait an hour before Louie gives me a cab.
Oh!
Banta!
Come over here.
Don't say I never done nothing for you.
Uh, Mr. De Palma, if I tipped you $5, would you consider, uh Hey, Tony, get out of there!
Get get out, come on.
Rieger!
What?
You got 142, come on.
Come on, get in, get in.
Taxi!
Old age is a funny thing.
I woke up this morning, found myself wanting blue hair.
Well, don't rush into anything, Dee.
All right, I'll think about it.
Did I tell you how I met George?
Your husband?
No, I don't think you mentioned that.
He came up to me at the counter where I was working, and he said, "I want a box of candy "for the most beautiful girl that I've ever seen.
What would you recommend"?
I gave him some milk chocolate-covered maraschino cherries wrapped in a heart-shaped box.
He bought it and he handed it to me.
Pretty slick, huh?
That's terrific, you know?
Yeah.
It's too bad you two didn't have enough time together.
Yeah.
Well I miss George's crapola.
You know, it must be very strange after a lifetime on a limited budget to be rich all of a sudden.
Oh, I felt very uncomfortable at first.
I was trying to live the same old way I'd always lived, be the same old Dee I'd always been.
And then one day I went shopping in Bloomingdale's.
I had a terrible time deciding what hat to buy.
Suddenly I said to myself, "What the hell, buy them all"!
And that was the day I decided being poor was best left to people with no money.
Another wonderful evening.
Yeah.
Here's your fare.
What did I give you for a tip last night?
Let's break a new record.
Oh, come on, please, let's not break a new record.
Oh, now, Dee I am not going to take $100 from you.
Now, look right at me.
I'm not taking $100 from you.
Oh, please don't say no.
Makes me feel patronized.
Okay.
You win, I lose.
So why don't I feel worse?
Well, maybe money doesn't mean that much to me.
What's important to me is what I can buy with my money: Nice food, nice clothes, nice people.
See you tomorrow, huh?
Hey, Alex!
You picking up the old lady again tonight?
Yes, if you mean Dee, I am.
Listen, this Dee doesn't have a sister, does she?
Would you believe it?
These guys have been picking up old ladies all over the city looking for a setup like yours.
It's not a setup, John.
She's just a customer.
Customer-- she's the mother lode.
You know, Alex, when I first got this job, everyone told me that the best fares were in the upper 80s.
I thought they were talking about streets.
Rieger!
An anonymous donor just called and said she wants to reupholster your cab.
I wonder who it could have been.
Did Mommy Warbucks raise your allowance?
That broad is older than the continental shelf!
Her age would make a good bowling score!
"Oh, Alex, be a dear and take the kitty out for a wee-wee".
Hey, Louie, Louie, take a quick gulp of this.
Thank you.
That's hot coffee!
I have a little surprise for you.
Oh, what's that?
It's a gift.
Oh, that's really nice of you, Dee, but I really can't accept gifts from you.
I mean, it's it's just not right.
Would you accept it if it was for your birthday?
Well, yeah, I guess, if it was my birthday.
Well, Happy Birthday, early or late, however you want to call it.
Oh, Dee!
That's really a very nice sport coat.
It's cashmere.
Look, Dee, I'm really feeling weird about driving you around at night, you know?
I mean, it's strange, you know what I mean?
Yeah, you're right, it is strange.
Why don't I drive you tonight?
No, no, that's not what I'm talking Whoa!
Oh, here's the place!
Oh.
"The Enchanted Island Ballroom".
Yeah, I've got to meet some friends of mine here.
They're going to a dance.
I've got to show up.
Uh, now, uh, would you, uh, wait for me?
I, uh, shouldn't be more than two or three hours.
Two or three hours!
Well, uh, how about if I come back?
Oh, no, wait.
Say, why don't you just come in?
Come on, Dee, you have to be kidding.
No!
Nobody even knows you and it's lovely and warm in there and there's plenty to eat and drink.
You can listen to the music.
No, no, I think I'd feel out of place, thank you.
Oh, they wouldn't notice you, dear.
Look, I'm not dressed.
Oh, sure, nothing could be dressier than a cashmere jacket.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Well, I think I'd need a tie.
Oh, yeah.
Merry Christmas.
Listen, Dee, I'll be waiting over there.
When you want to leave, come get me, okay?
Aw, no, come on and visit a little.
Dee, I don't know anybody here.
Oh, sure you do.
Uh, there's, uh, Emily Simmons the one I told you had 37 grandchildren.
Oh, yeah.
And there's Mary Trueworthy.
She's in DAR.
And, uh, there's the gal I told you had three facelifts.
Bertha Farris.
That's her.
My God, I know everybody here.
Look, you see that man over there with the, uh, gray hair?
Are you kidding?
Oh, dear.
I mean I mean the one with the white carnation in his lapel.
Oh.
That's Weldon Manning.
Oh, yeah, I heard you mention him.
Yeah.
I've had my eye on him for a long time.
I'm bringing him along slowly.
You may not see any smoke, but I happen to know there's a fire in that furnace.
Oh, he's coming over here.
Hello, Dee.
Weldon, I didn't know you were coming tonight.
You look lovely tonight, Dee.
May I have the honor of this dance?
Oh, certainly.
Would you excuse us, Alex?
Yes, certainly.
Thank you.
I'll just be over here holding up the wall.
That's a cutie you're with tonight.
Excuse me?
Oh.
I'm with the one over there, with the fox stole.
That's the only thing foxy about her.
Yeah, that's too bad.
Well, my Maserati needs a tune-up, and sometimes it's hard to make ends meet, you know?
Yeah.
I wonder when the government will get around to socialized Maserati tune-ups?
Yes!
Do you drive one yourself?
No.
Actually I drive a different car every night.
Hey, ¡bueno!
¡Mucho mejor!
Sometimes I wonder whether it's all worth it-- you know, spending hours under the sun lamp, visiting the hair stylist four times a week doing pushups, situps, day after day Aw, a man's got to do what a man's got to do.
Yes.
By the way, they, uh they call me Ramon.
Oh.
Call me, uh, Tandalayo.
Hey, Tandalayo, are you new on the circuit?
Well, actually, Ramon, I'm not on the circuit.
I'm just here with a friend.
You mean you're dating grandma for nothing?
Now, look, Ramon, in the first place, she's not a grandma, in the second place, we're not dating and in the third place, she's just a friend of mine.
Hey, you're sensitive-- they like that.
You will do well.
Oh, excuse me, my lady just got out a cigarette.
Duty calls, you know.
Yup.
I like your tie.
Thanks.
I like your ribs.
Hey, thank you.
Hey, Alex I'm afraid I have to spend most of the evening with Weldon.
Well, he seems like a nice man.
Yes, but, we can still have one dance, can't we?
I'd be charmed.
Wasn't it great?
Yeah, great.
Aw, lighten up a little.
For a young guy, you can be a real drip sometimes.
I won the Rhumba contest, didn't I?
Uh, no, I won the Rhumba contest.
I was carrying you.
Dee, I didn't ask to go to that dance.
Oh, well next time, try to get into the spirit of the thing.
I'm not going to any more dances, please.
Oh, you just felt self-conscious because your coat is too small for you.
Next time I'll get you a white suit like that guy Ramon had.
Dee, Dee, I think it's time we called a halt to this whole arrangement.
What do you mean?
We can't go on seeing each other like this.
We can't?
No!
I mean, look, it's okay, I we can see each other once in a while, but, please, no more money.
I can't handle it, please.
No more money, okay?
I guess it's good-bye.
What?
Wouldn't be the same without the money.
What are you talking about?
Well, money may not mean that much to you but to me, it ranks right up there with oxygen.
It's the best way there is of dealing with people.
What about friendship?
Well, next time you go into a restaurant you tell the Maitre d' if he gives you a good table, you'll be his buddy.
Well, then, give your money to Maitre d's and waitresses, somebody who wants it.
But you don't have to give me money, Dee.
No, I know that but it wouldn't be the same without money.
I wouldn't be able to trust you.
You'd be more casual about calling.
You wouldn't be on time.
Money makes people punctual.
I know people gave their whole lives to their children.
Those children don't even come to see them.
If I had any kids, you can bet your buttons I would put them on my payroll, and they'd come to see me.
Especially on payday.
Aw, come on, don't let's argue, Alex.
I had a wonderful time tonight.
Here, come and pick me up tomorrow at 4:00.
I'm having my hair done.
Damn it!
You are the most Never mind.
What?
No, it's better I don't say anything.
No, say what you were thinking.
I'm old enough to take it.
Okay, you want to hear what I'm thinking?
I'll tell you what I'm thinking.
I think this whole arrangement stinks.
I have never felt so used in all my life.
You know, I thought that you really liked me.
I thought we were friends.
But that wasn't what you had in mind, was it?
I was just a piece of merchandise.
Why do I sound like Joan Crawford?
Aw, don't stop, it was just starting to be fun.
Well, it may be fun for you but it's not fun for me.
I really don't enjoy being with people I don't like.
And I I don't like you anymore.
Horse manure, you love me.
Yeah, I guess I do.
Can we still have lunch together?
Okay, but only if I pay.
Aw, you're sweet, Alex.
I just hope my stomach can take those dumps you can afford.
Good night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Louie.
Huh?
Louie.
Listen, I have a bad cavity in my tooth.
So is it okay if I leave early and go to the dentist?
The dentist.
Yeah.
That reminds me of a story I heard yesterday.
Yeah?
This guy goes into the dentist's office and he says to the nurse, he says, "Nurse, me and my wife "are having very bad sexual problems.
So could I please make an appointment"?
So the nurse says, "Oh, sir, you don't need a dentist.
You need a psychologist".
And he said, "No, no, nurse, I need a dentist.
With my wife, it's like pulling teeth".
So that means it's all right to go to the dentist?
No, no, no way.
Okay, now get back to work, Latka.
Hey, fellas.
Hi, Tony.
Did you have a good weekend?
Nah, I went on a blind date, and I hate blind dates.
So what did you go on one for?
Sort of a favor to Bobby.
See, he had this really terrific date with this really terrific girl, and she had a cousin who she didn't want to leave home so I had to go along.
Well, what do you mean you had to go along?
Well, you know, Bobby's sort of my best friend.
I couldn't let him down.
Well, why not?
I mean, just 'cause he's your best friend doesn't mean you have to do everything he wants you to do.
Of course, it does.
That's exactly what it means.
When I was a kid, I had this best friend, Bob McDaniel.
Whenever either one of us needed anything, the other would come a-running, no matter what.
We even had a special call we made up.
I still remember it.
Yak-yak-yak-a-bye.
Yak-a-bye.
Yak-a-bye.
Nobody panic.
Where is the yakabye?
No.
No, Latka.
No Yakabye.
Oh, it's a false alarm?
Uh-huh.
It's okay, no Yakabye.
Hi, Latka.
Hello.
Oh, too bad-- you miss Yakabye drill.
Shucks.
Hey, so you really had a good time on your date?
Oh, Alex, Dominique is one terrific lady.
Yeah?
I haven't felt this way about a girl in a long time.
Oh, that's terrific.
Hey, how about you, Tony?
How was your date?
I don't want to talk about it.
Hey, what are you talking about?
I thought you two had a lot in common.
Why?
'Cause she wanted to be a boxer?
I never want to see her again especially in the ring-- I wouldn't have a chance.
Hey, Banta, telephone.
Hey, you guys want to come over to my house Sunday and watch the big game?
Hey, hey, that's an idea.
Oh, I'd love to, but I'm taking the kids to the movies.
Oh, Suzanne and I have plans too.
Hey, Latka, you want to watch the football game in my apartment?
Okay, thank you.
It's better than watching it on television.
I'll explain it to him later.
Hey, guess what, guys!
I'm fighting tomorrow, out of town.
Where you fighting?
I'm fighting in Scranton.
I'm fighting the state champ.
Hey, Pennsylvania's supposed to be a really tough boxing state, isn't it?
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm fighting the state champ of New hampshire.
Do they have a lot of middleweights in New Hampshire?
Three.
The guy I'm fighting just took the title away from his father.
You're not just fighting a champ-- you're fighting a whole dynasty.
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, I got to go to the gym, pick up my stuff cancel the paper.
Hey, Bobby, will you feed my fish?
Uh, Tony, I I'll bring them to your place.
Don't worry, man!
A pinch of food every morning.
Yeah, but Tony, I don't know anything about fish.
There's nothing to it, man.
Ten seconds a day.
Why don't you ask somebody else to do it all right?
I'm asking you.
I do a lot of stuff for you.
Can't you do one little thing for me?
All right, give me your fish.
You're going to love them.
Now listen, make sure you feed them every day because me and my fish go back a long way.
I mean almost four years.
I bought them with the purse from my first big win-- $3.00.
Wow.
I got to go.
See ya.
Get 'em, Tony!
So long, Tony.
Tony!
Oh Oh, my.
Oh, me, oh, my.
Oh, I don't know what to do.
Oh, it's so bad.
Wait, wait.
Does that hurt that bad?
Yes.
This is bad?
Ow!
All right, all right, go to the You better go to the dentist.
Oh, thank you very much.
You know, Louie, you know, sometime people talk about you.
They say bad things about you.
They say that you are cheap and mean and cruel and nasty.
Hey, Bobby, you in there?
Bobby?
He's not in there.
Wait a minute, he usually leaves the key out here somewhere.
Ah, ah, there it is.
I guess he must have gone out for a while.
Hey, Latka, why don't you put the game on, and I'll stick this in the fridge.
Okay.
I hope he went out to shop.
There's only a loaf of old bread in here.
We could have beer and toast.
No, thank you.
I'm trying to watch my babas.
Hey, there he is.
Come on, Bobby, you're going to miss the kickoff.
Hey, you just getting in?
Yeah.
You devil.
No, it really wasn't like that.
Dominique and I spent the whole night talking.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, she told me her life story, man.
What a great girl!
You know, she turned down Warren Beatty.
Imagine that.
Me and Warren being turned down by the same girl.
Hey, you guys want some toast?
Hey, come on, Bobby you're going to miss a great game.
You like football, Latka?
Well, you know, this football is very confusing.
What's confusing?
Well, you see, because this team here is called the Giants, but they are not bigger than the other team.
And also, this team is called the Redskins, but they are almost all black.
Hello?
Yeah hey, it's Tony.
Hey, wow, how you doing?
Hey, let me talk.
Here's Alex.
Hey, Tony, how you doing?
Yeah, how's Scranton?
Oh, you took your camera, that's great.
Yeah, what?
Really?
And they're staying at your hotel?
Who?
Who?
The Platters.
Hey, Tony, are those the original Platters?
Oh, just one cousin?
Yeah, okay Hey, listen, Tony-- drop that guy, you hear me?
Drop him!
Yeah, okay.
No, here's Bob.
So, champ, how you feeling?
Yeah, yeah, the fish are fine.
Yeah, the two of them.
Look, you just worry about the fight, okay?
All right, now, listen the three of us are really pulling for you, man.
Okay, the five of us are really pulling for you.
Okay, now you do good, all right?
All right, all right, come home a winner.
All right, bye-bye.
What a crazy guy.
Yeah.
Hey, Bobby, you're missing a great game here.
I'll be there.
Oh, look at that catch.
Hey, Bobby, come here.
You can see the replay.
You know, in my country, they don't have instant replay.
They just make them do it over again.
That Tony, it's the biggest fight of his career and he's worrying about two dumb fish.
Man, how can anybody care about these things?
Two little nothings.
Just floating around on their backs.
They do move their fins, you know, Bob?
Uh-uh, not these.
They're just lying there.
Bobby, did you feed those fish today?
How could I?
I was busy.
You know, I just got home.
Don't worry about it.
I'll feed them now.
I don't want to go over there.
Will you look at that?
They're not even hungry.
Come on, roll over and eat.
Come on!
Oh, my God!
What?
They're dead, Bobby.
They're dead.
Well, I guess it was just their time, huh?
Their time?
Both of them, together?
I don't know, I don't know.
Maybe it was one of those murder-suicide things.
What's Bobby going to do?
I don't know.
He just said stall Tony until he gets here.
Those fish really meant a lot to Tony.
He's going to be heartbroken.
I love it.
Now, listen, Louie-- this is a very sensitive situation.
When Tony comes in if I hear you say one word, like Bobby killed your fish.
That's right.
Hey, what's happening, guys?
Nothing.
Oh, hi, Tony.
Hey, how was the fight?
Oh, I lost.
It's all right, Elaine.
The guy told me I gave him a much better fight than his old man.
Hey, so, where's Bobby?
Huh, Bobby?
He's uh he called.
He's going to be a little late.
So, how was Scranton?
Man, was it cold.
Half the time I was frozen stiff.
Speaking of stiffs So What have you got in the bag?
Oh, wait till you see.
It's a little castle.
Oh.
I bought it for my fish.
You know, I think they can swim in and out.
I thought I'd surprise them.
They're going to love it, Tony.
You see?
It's got "Scranton" on it and everything.
You know I know it may seem a little weird to care about them the way I do, but I mean, to me, them fish are like symbols.
I mean, of, like, survival.
If them little fish can survive in this world than so can I. You know what I mean?
I can't wait to see them again.
Hey, Alex, you saw them yesterday.
How did they look?
Peaceful.
Yeah, they're so easy-going.
Hey, I'm going to put this stuff away.
I'll be back.
Somebody has got to tell him soon, for my sake.
Boy, I'm really glad I'm not Bobby.
It's going to break the guy's heart.
This is great.
Is he here yet?
Where have you been?
I had to go to four stores before I could find two that matched exactly.
I just hope this works.
Hey, Bobby.
Yeah, it's Bobby.
Look at that.
Hey, Tony, how'd the fight go?
Oh, I lost.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hey They look great, huh?
Yeah.
Healthy, strong, happy, huh?
Oh, gee, thanks, Bobby.
Oh, forget it.
No, I mean it.
I really love these guys.
I hope they get along with my fish.
Hey, where are they?
Tony?
Yeah.
Uh, I-I-I-I got to tell you something.
What's that, Bob?
Um, your fish uh, they didn't make it.
What?
Tony, I forgot to feed them yesterday and when I came home they were My fish?
Listen, I'd give anything if it didn't happen, man.
My fish are dead.
Look, I know it doesn't help much but I think they went in their sleep.
Where are they now?
Did you flush them?
I wouldn't do that, Tony.
No, man.
I saved them for you.
I got them right here.
You killed my fish.
Hey, Tony, listen if you want to slug me just not in the face.
I got an audition.
I don't want to slug you, Bobby.
I don't want to have nothing to do with you, friend.
Hey, Tony, what did you book?
He booked 90, fish killer.
Hey, buddy, you need a quarter?
I got it.
Hey, Tone, I got these two tickets to the Islanders' game.
I know how you really Oh, he's really grieving.
I remember when our dog Bootsie died.
I was devastated for years.
How many?
So far 12.
You know, Alex, this is really too much.
I mean, I know I made a mistake-- A big mistake.
I mean, I really feel lousy about what happened to Tony's fish.
I mean I hate myself when I do things like that-- forgetting things, not coming through for people, but jeez, how many times do I have to apologize?
Now, if he doesn't want to be my friend, well, that's fine with me.
That's great, that's great.
It's over.
Who needs him?
You want me to talk to him?
Would you, please?
Yeah.
Listen, why don't you tell him to come over to my place and we'll sit down, have some beers, and spend the evening together and talk it out, okay?
Okay.
Oh, would you come with him?
Yeah.
Hey, Tony.
Hey, Al.
Listen, Bobby's really hurting.
He wants to patch it up.
What do you say?
I don't know, Alex.
I mean, he really let me down.
It's not just the fish.
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.
Well, look, he's really sorry for what he did.
I mean, what could it hurt?
You two sit down, talk it out Alex, I'm telling you-- he really let me down this time.
It ain't right.
I'm not going to let him get away with it.
Look, he just wants you to come over to his place and talk about it, that's all.
Oh, yeah?
Give me one good reason why I should.
Because I think the fish would want it that way.
I guess you're right.
Hey, we're a little early.
He's probably out buying food.
You know, this is a first for Bobby.
When he comes to my place, not only doesn't he bring stuff, he usually takes stuff home.
Like once, he took a lamp.
That one.
Hey, there's a couple of beers in here.
You want one?
Yeah.
I can't believe this guy.
He borrows stuff; he never gives it back.
There's my dumbbells, there's my football and that's my clock.
Well, he doesn't mean anything by it.
He's just forgetful.
That's the way he is.
Yeah, but that's what I'm talking about.
I mean, you take Bobby-- he treats me creepy, he ignores me calls me stupid.
I mean, what do I like him for?
I mean, there are guys I don't even like that treat me better.
One guy I hate treats me almost as good.
I mean, what is it, Alex?
I don't Tony.
I don't know what makes people friends.
Hey Look.
He kept them two phonies he was trying to pass off as George and Wanda.
Poor little guys.
I wonder if they know their days are numbered.
It's a dog's life.
He makes me so mad I'd like to destroy something of his.
Something that he really cares about so he'd know how I feel.
His lucky shirt.
Hey, Tony, don't.
The one he wears to all his auditions.
Tony, you're going to regret this I'm ripping off a sleeve.
No, no, don't don't don't!
Hey, man, let me go!
I can't.
I knew you couldn't.
Gee, I just remembered-- it's my shirt.
You know, even if it wasn't my shirt, man, I couldn't have done it anyway.
I mean, it's like you said-- a guy can do what he can do, and he can't do what he can't do, so if a guy doesn't do what he can't do, what are you going to do?
I said that?
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
What are we doing here?
You begged me to have Tony come over here so you two could sit down Oh, no.
Oh, no was that tonight?
Oh, geez, Tony, I'm really sorry.
How can I do this?
I'll tell you how.
Because you are irresponsible, inconsiderate, undependable Maybe I should leave.
No, no, no, Dominique, listen Would you mind just waiting in the bedroom?
Open the door, down the hall it's nice to see you again, Tony.
Yeah.
How's your cousin?
She had any good fights lately?
No, not lately.
See you.
Where was I?
"Undependable".
Right!
Undependable, selfish, insensitive Hey, Alex?
Huh?
Don't be so hard on him.
He don't mean it.
He just forgets.
How can you defend him?
He killed your fish!
I murdered George and Wendy.
George and Wanda!
Wanda!
The least you could do is get their names straight!
Wanda!
Wanda Wanda.
Don't be so hard on him.
People are what they are.
You said it.
Yeah, and I'm damn mad and that's the way I am!
And not just at him because you're just as much to blame as he is.
I mean, it's not as if you didn't know how irresponsible he was.
But you put your fish in the hands of a man who can't even feed himself half the time!
Are you saying I had something to do with killing my own fish?
That's right!
Hey, that's a crummy remark, man.
I think you should take that back Take it back?
Why?
It's true!
What are you talking about?
I didn't kill my own fish.
You know him!
Don't you?
How can you possibly put your fish in the  What do you want?
!
Listen, it's me you're mad at, remember?
Yeah.
It's it's it's   Wendy, Wanda.
Oh I love you guys.
I can't believe this.
Hey, listen.
Grab your coats.
I'm going to take you out for a steak dinner tonight.
Steak and Lowenbrau-- just like the commercial.
Wheeler You're a genius.
Yeah.
And after dinner, I know this scalper.
He's going to get us three tickets to the Knicks' game.
Okay?
Let's go.
Let's go.
Oh, my God.
Huh?
Oh.
Oh.
I'm just going to have to tell Dominique that I'm spending the evening with you guys.
Hey, listen, Bobby No, no, no, Alex Alex, this is very important to me.
Now I said we're going out tonight and I'm sticking to it.
I got to stop letting people down like this.
From now on, when I say something I'm going to do it, and that's that!
Hey, Bobby, that's really great No, no, no, man I said we're going out and we're going.
and we're going to have a great time too.
Just give me a second.
Yeah, sure, go ahead.
That was funny.
Oh, boy.
Hey!
Hey, Alex, I got to do something.
No, no, Tony, don't!
There you go, guys.
Hey, can I have your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen?
I have a presentation to make.
For my best friend, Tony.
For me?
That's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
He got my fish mounted.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
What?
Mr. De Palma, my name's Goodwin.
I'm starting today.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, Mr. Goodwin, let me give you a couple of tips here.
You'll get cab 607 when it's ready.
All right?
Now, you listen to me.
We can get along very nicely if you remember these three things.
One: Keep your bookings high.
Two: Call me at least if you're going to miss work and three, and most importantly: There is a certain word that I never want to hear around here.
What word is that, Mr. De Palma?
This is a certain word that I hate more than any word in the entire English language and it is a word that I never want to hear around here.
What's the word I never want to hear around here?
You see how well they know I don't want to hear that word?
The word is "accident".
You got that?
Got it.
Now, you can do whatever you want.
You want to peddle dope, you want to be a white slaver-- anything you want, that's your business.
If you ever come up to me and say to me that you had a you-know-what in one of my cabs, I'm going to rip your head off and use it as a radiator cap.
You got that?
I understand.
Nice to have you aboard.
Okay.
Hi, everybody.
Hi, John.
Hey, John.
How you doing, man?
Fine.
Hi, Louie.
Burns Where's the rest?
Uh, that's all there is, Louie.
You drove around for ten hours and that's all you got to show for it?
What do you do, put a quarantine sign in the window?
I'm I'm sorry, uh I'll try harder next time, okay?
You know something, Burns?
You are, without a doubt, the worst cabby I ever had.
One more night-- just one more time-- you come dragging in here with that Howdy Doody face of yours and change for a quarter in your booking envelope and I'm telling you, so help me What?
Ow!
Louie, what's wrong?
Get him a glass of water.
Hey, you want to sit down?
It's okay, it's okay.
It's that heartburn again.
You sure it's only heartburn, Louie?
Ow!
Whatever it is, I don't like it.
Hey, you want to go upstairs and lie down?
No, I'm all right.
It's going away.
Have you been getting these pains a lot?
Yeah, for about a month now.
Hey, Louie, don't you think you ought to see a doctor?
What, see a doctor for a simple gut-wrenching pain?
Yeah.
Maybe I'd better, I'd better go see one now.
Yeah, I think you should.
Here, let me help you.
That's okay, you guys.
I can take care of him.
I'll get your coat, Louie.
I hope you feel better, Louie.
Take it easy.
Thanks.
Here you go, Louie.
Thanks, Burns.
Sure you're okay?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.
Hey, you want me to drive you?
No, no, no.
Listen, Burns.
Huh?
Thanks for your concern.
Oh, that's all right.
And, you know, about what I was saying before, you know, about your bookings and about how I was going to fire you if you had another bad night Yeah, Louie.
Don't forget it.
I really appreciate you guys coming in to visit me.
Aw, how could we not come after you sent us that cute little note?
"Please come and see me before I die".
Louie, Louie, Louie, look, it's just an exploratory operation.
I mean, they just want to take a look and see if everything's okay.
Call it whatever you want, they're cutting me up and going inside.
Once they're in there, who knows what's gonna happen?
Louie, I can understand what you're worried about, but the way the doctor explained it to us, it's just routine, that's all.
Maybe for them it is, but not for me.
I'm scared-- I never been in a hospital before.
Sure you have.
You were born, weren't you?
As a matter of fact, I was delivered on a kitchen table by a midwife.
It was the only room that had any heat.
Wow, a kitchen table!
Well, half the kitchen table.
Dad was eating dinner on the other half.
Hey, Louie.
How come your mother's not here?
I didn't want to worry her, so I didn't tell her about it.
She thinks I'm out of town, seeing you fight.
No kidding.
Who'd I fight?
Some kid from Mexico.
How'd I do?
He knocks you out in the second round.
Yeah, them Mexican guys are tough.
Anybody want some chocolates?
No, no, thanks.
No.
Oh, no, thanks, I don't eat sugar.
I try to eat only natural things.
How'd you like a sack of dirt?
Louie, did you say chocolate candy?
Yeah, have one.
Thank you very much.
I said, "Have one".
Oh, you said, "Have one"?
I thought you said, "Leave one".
I'm afraid you'll all have to leave now.
Oh, hey, listen, Louie, take it easy now.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Louie, if you don't make it back to the garage, we'll understand.
Bye.
Hey, Lou, I hope you feel better.
See you in a day or two, all right?
Thanks.
Good-bye, Louie.
Alex?
Yeah.
Can I speak to you for a second, please?
Well, the nurse did ask us to leave, Louie.
I know, but this is something really important.
It won't take long.
Okay.
I just want to talk to you about life and death and God.
Good, then I won't have to sit down.
Yeah?
Alex Yeah.
Now that the others are gone, I got to be honest with you.
I'm not just scared, I'm terrified.
Louie, Louie, Louie, now look, you got to try to relax.
You understand?
How can I relax?
This could be the end for me.
Tell me something, Alex.
Are you are you a religious man?
Yeah, in a way I am, yeah.
Good.
Then you'll understand what I'm about to do.
God It's Louie Louie De Palma.
I know it's been a long time since you heard from me.
I'm kind of out of practice at praying, but I just thought I I felt like I had to talk to you now.
By the way, this is Alex Rieger.
He's a friend of mine.
Say hello to God, Alex.
No, Louie, listen, I don't think, I Say hello.
He hasn't got all day.
Hello, there.
Listen, I-I just wanted Alex here as a witness to what I'm about to say.
Look, God I know I ain't been no saint and I've done some pretty rotten things in my life.
Alex can back me up on that.
Tell him, Alex.
Huh?
Oh, Louie, I don't think I Go on, tell him the truth.
Well, um he's not your best work.
Thanks.
Look, God, I want to make a deal with you.
If you can arrange it so that I live through this operation, I'll be the best person I can be A whole new Louie De Palma-- kind generous honest.
What do you say, God?
Is it a deal?
Look I tell you what.
You send me a sign.
Let me see I got it.
Unless a bolt of lightning shoots through that window in the next five seconds, I'll consider it a deal.
Well, I guess you got yourself a deal, huh?
Yeah, and I'm going to stick by it.
Time to go, Mr. De Palma.
Oh, hey, listen, Louie, just take it easy now.
Everything is gonna be all right.
Don't worry about a thing.
You I hope so.
I hope so.
Alex.
What?
Listen.
Whatever happens, Yeah.
I want you to know that you've been a good friend.
Yeah, okay, Louie.
Come on I mean it.
Take care of yourself.
And I hope the world is kind to you.
Thanks, Lou.
And, and listen, if I don't make it, don't tell Ma that I died.
Tell her that I'm on a mission for the government.
She'll believe you.
She's a little funny in the head.
Hey, guys.
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Tony.
I thought Louie was coming back today.
Yeah, he is.
He should be in any minute.
I am so proud of Louie.
I can't believe how he bounced back  Yeah.
from that operation so fast.
Isn't it great that it was only gallstones?
How many gallstones did they have to remove?
Just one.
Aw, man, that's good.
As long as you still got one, he could still have kids.
You know, I-I still can't get over that story Alex told us about Louie's deal with God.
Hey, do you think he's gonna keep it?
Well, I think he's gonna try.
Yeah, for about ten minutes.
No, no, no, I mean it, Bobby.
Make that five minutes.
Yeah, well, I think he's gonna make it.
Yeah?
I got $50 that says he can't make it through one day without yelling, screaming and generally abusing at least one person in this garage.
Wait a minute, Bob, are you really serious?
I mean, you're gonna make a bet about a man keeping his faithful oath with his God?
I'll give you two to one.
You're on.
All right.
Hey!
Hey, Louie!
Hey!
Hey!
Wow, you look terrific, you know?
Well, it's great to be back.
How do you feel?
Oh, oh, I feel great.
I feel terrific.
How's everybody been?
Oh, everybody's fine.
Everybody's fine.
Yeah.
Rock 'n' roll.
John, how are the bookings?
Oh, not so good, I'm afraid.
Last night I had my worst night ever.
I'm sorry.
It's only money.
Oh, Elaine How are your kids?
They're fine.
Why don't you bring them down to the garage someday for a visit?
I'd love to see them.
After all, a man is never taller than when he stoops to help a child.
And nobody can stoop lower than you, De Palma.
Thank you, my friend.
Latka.
Latka, Latka, Latka.
Hi.
Always working, Yeah.
never resting.
That's right.
Come let's have a cup of coffee.
Okay.
My treat.
Okay.
Two lumps?
So, tell me, Latka, what's been new in your life?
Oh, what's new?
Yeah.
Well, uh, this morning I heard a very good joke from my cousin Baji.
Oh, from Baji!
Oh, let's hear it.
I love a good joke.
Okay.
Eh       Boom!
Boom!
Boom!
Boom!
Ah!
Ah!
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah?
Hey, Louie?
What's so funny?
Oh?
What's the matter, you heard it already?
Would you like to pay up right now, Bob?
Hey, it's just the beginning of the day.
Give him time, Alex.
He'll revert to form.
No way, Bob, believe me.
Just watch.
Come to turn in your bookings, Bob?
Uh, uh, actually, I don't, I don't have any bookings.
Uh, you see When I left the garage this morning Yes?
Well, I had, I had a little, uh Yes?
Well, in fact, it wasn't all that little.
Uh, I I had this really big Yes?
In fact, "big" isn't even the right word.
"Total".
I-I have to say "total".
I What-what is it you're trying to tell me, Bob?
Louie, I had an accident.
You had an ac-ac You had an acc An accident?
Yeah an accident.
I'll be darned.
Well, I don't want you to worry, Bob.
Some careless drunk just rams into your car, what can you do?
Um it wasn't any careless drunk.
See, it was my fault.
I I ran a stop sign.
You ran a stop sign?
Yeah.
You see, uh I couldn't see it.
I forgot to turn on my headlights.
Oh Excuse me.
Oh, well, accidents happen.
Sorry, Bob.
You win, Alex.
You-you win.
I don't believe it.
You  I told you.
Yeah, but I don't believe it.
I I Wow.
What's that you're saying, Bob?
Well, I got to hand it to you, Louie.
I didn't really think you could change.
I mean-- but you did.
I mean, I even bet Alex that you couldn't be a nice guy for one whole day.
Oh Oh, I see.
Then there wasn't any accident after all.
Yeah, that's right.
You were just testing me.
Playing a little game with me.
Yeah.
You were testing me to see if I could break my pact with God.
Ye-Yeah, I-I guess so.
I guess it was like that, but, uh, man, you wouldn't crack.
You're great.
I WellAlex?
Louie, what, what are you doing?
Louie, what are you Louie, what are you Louie, what the heck are you doing?
!
Stop it now!
Stop it right now!
Louie!
Louie, what are you doing?
You scum!
You lowlife!
You cretin!
I'm going to make you regret the day you were born!
I'm gonna make sure that every night you get the dirtiest smelliest cab in the garage, and if there isn't one that's dirty and smelly, then I'm gonna get in and smelly and dirty it up myself.
In the wintertime, your cab will have no heater.
In the summertime, your windows won't roll down.
I'm gonna make you the second most miserable cab driver in all of New York City.
The most miserable cab driver in all of New York City is whoever lets him down or feeds him.
Looks like you won the bet, Bob.
What are you doing?
Alex.
Hey, come on.
Hi, Louie.
You believe in hell, Alex?
Believe in it?
I work there.
I broke a promise, Alex.
And I don't mean I broke a promise to some clown like yourself.
I broke a promise with Him.
I don't do nothing halfway, do I?
Oh, come on, Louie.
Will you stop being so hard on yourself?
Anybody could see you tried.
Now, come on, it's time to go home.
I ain't leaving here, Alex.
Why not?
'Cause God's waiting for me outside.
He's rolled up His sleeves.
He's got His brass knuckles on.
He's getting ready for me.
Come on, Louie, I didn't see anybody outside.
Let's go home, huh?
It's no use, Alex.
I committed the biggest sin in the book.
I welshed on God.
You know, Louie I don't think you really did.
What are you talking about?
You heard the promise I made to Him.
Yeah, that's just what I mean.
I mean, do you remember the exact words you said?
I mean, what exactly did you say?
I promised I'd be a good person.
No.
I think your exact words were "I'm going to be the best person I can possibly be".
So what?
Well, Louie, maybe the best person that you can possibly be is a rat.
What are you talking about?
Well, you can't be something you're not.
I mean God made you what you are.
And if God made you the way you are, then He must have had a reason.
But we can be sure that just as He had a reason for creating snakes and lice and vermin He had a reason for creating you, too.
That's a beautiful thought, Alex.
Yeah.
You you really think He could forgive me for what I did?
Well, I-I think you got a good shot, Louie.
And you really think that He understands me being the way I am: Mean and nasty and rotten and that in some way, maybe it's part of His scheme of things?
Yeah, I think so.
Thank you, Alex.
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
Back to the garage so that I may continue fulfilling His divine purpose.
Hmm    Good night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Taxi!
Taxi!
Take this cab to Cuba.
Did you hear that?
I said Cuba, like like a hijack.
God, life.
I love it!
Don't you love it?
Don't you love life, driver?
No, we're just good friends.
Where to?
Well, where do you want to go now, Jill?
You want to go to a show?
You want to go out dancing?
Seven that's where you live.
Yes, it is.
A-ha.
You mean you want to go to your place.
Desperately.
You heard her.
I heard her.
Oh, wasn't that a great restaurant?
Especially nice when you can share it with someone you like.
It must be.
You know, uh there are those who claim oysters to be an aphrodisiac.
Let me out here.
It's not the address you gave me.
Yeah, I want to walk.
I need some air.
You can't get out here.
This is a terrible part of town.
He's right, you know.
You can get killed in this neighborhood.
Well, in that case, let him out.
Did I say something to offend you tonight?
Everything after hello.
Please, Jill, the driver can hear us.
No, not a word.
I don't care if he can hear us.
I want him to hear us.
I want a witness to what this evening was like for me while it's still fresh in my memory.
He insisted on ordering the meal in French.
My main course was ten pats of butter.
If you were having such a lousy time, why didn't you say something earlier?
What did you think that I meant when I said two hours ago, "Please, for the love of God, take me home"?
I thought you were coming on to me.
Okay, here we are.
Thank goodness!
Uh can I see you to the door?
No.
I guess this means you don't want to sleep with me.
Where to?
Who cares?
Hey, it's none of my business, but if you want my opinion, she was no great prize, you know.
With all the women in this city, you don't have to get hung up on her.
That's easy for you to say.
You're a cab driver.
You have women in your cab all day long.
I never meet anybody.
What do you do?
I'm a United States Congressman.
Say, uh, listen, I'll just check in, and then maybe we can go for a beer.
What do you say?
I'm in no hurry.
Okay.
Where's Louie?
Oh, hi.
Took his mom to the dentist.
In the middle of the night?
Yeah, he found this discount dentist only works nights.
Leave it to Louie, right?
Yeah.
Very romantic.
Root canal by starlight.
Hey, listen.
You want a cup of coffee?
It may be a while.
Oh, sure.
You know, I think you're the first congressman we've ever had in this garage.
I still don't think of myself as a congressman.
You see, Dad's a major contributor to the party, so, to thank him, they, uh, they ran me for Congress.
Yeah, and you won the election.
That's great.
In a district my party's always won.
But you won.
The week before the election my opponent was convicted of murder.
But you did win.
We had to have a runoff.
Yeah, so now, you're in office.
I bet you're showing them, huh?
There's talk of a recall.
Ah, who cares about that?
You dress nice.
Look, you know, I really appreciate you trying to cheer me up like this.
Hey, hey.
How you doing, Alex?
Guys, I'd like you to meet Walter Griswold.
Walter is a United States Congressman.
How do you do?
Hey, I'm in your district.
I voted for you.
Oh, yeah?
Why?
The other guy was up for murder.
Oh, yeah.
Congressman?
Yeah, Latka, this is a very important person in our government.
Oh.
No, no, Latka!
You don't have to give him money.
No, no, in America, they just like to shake hands.
Oh.
This is good country.
Nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you.
Thank you very much.
All right, guys.
Line up, animals.
Hey, Louie, how's your mom's teeth?
Oh, okay.
She had to have a little work done but this guy's prices are so reasonable I even sprung for Novocaine.
It's my own mother.
What the hell?
Hey, listen, Walter, I'll be right back, okay?
Okay.
Hey, so what are you doing in our garage, Your Honor?
Oh, well, I was out on a date, but the lady had to cut the evening short.
Said something about having to get up early and change her phone number.
Yeah, his date was a real sweetheart, if you know what I mean.
No, Alex, it wasn't her.
It was me.
The fact is, uh I'm a loser with women.
Come on.
Women.
In my country, women work like ox.
They cook, they have lots of babies, uh they get old early.
They happy.
In America, the women, they have, uh they have maids, they dress with nice clothes, they take bubble bath.
They happy.
What is your point?
Women happy people.
Hey, Walt, I didn't think a congressman would have any trouble getting chicks.
Oh, boy, this one does.
You see, all I ever wanted in life was a nice, sweet, average girl who couldn't keep her hands off of me.
Every time I go out, I make a fool out of myself.
It's getting so I can't get dates.
You know how embarrassing it is to go to the presidential inaugural ball stag?
I only hope people think I'm gay.
You know, Walter, I used to have trouble with women.
And then I found that the best way to handle them was to just be myself.
No, it wouldn't work for me.
Why not?
You're cute.
Oh, yeah.
Walter, you know, there isn't a guy here who hasn't been rejected.
I mean, you're taking this too seriously.
A woman once said to me, "I never want to see you again as long as I live".
That's happened to everybody.
We hadn't been introduced.
He is wearing a nice suit, though, isn't he, fellas?
No, no, I might as well just give up.
Oh, Walter, baloney.
You know what your trouble is?
You try too hard.
You know, women sense your anxiety.
What you really need is some confidence.
I think a date with a very attractive but a very, uh a very nice person would do you a lot of good, you know that?
And I have someone in mind.
Her.
Damn it, Louie, you little twerp Now, listen to me.
I am not going to take that kind of garbage from you anymore, so you can just cram it!
Oh!
She's uch nicer than what I'm used to.
Elaine, I want to thank you for going out with me tonight.
Did I already thank you?
Yeah, you thanked me.
You thanked my children, you thanked my baby-sitter I believe you can't say "thank you" too often.
Well, yeah, that's true.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I guess you can say "thank you" too often.
Walter, just relax.
You saw me perspire, didn't you?
Excuse me?
I perspire.
Well, everyone perspires.
I perspire freely.
I'm talking buckets.
That's why I'll never be reelected.
Who's going to vote for a man who always looks like he just stepped out of a sauna?
So, what's it like living in Washington?
Oh, God, do I sweat in Washington.
It is so humid there, as if that would make any difference.
I'd probably sweat on the Matterhorn.
I shake hands with people, and they wipe their hands off.
They pretend to do something else so they won't hurt my feelings.
They, uh they cross their arms.
They adjust their ties.
They wave hello at friends.
Could we talk about something else?
I'm talking about sweat again.
Why do I always talk sweat on dates?
It's because I'm always sweating on dates.
I was the only one who said no.
Oh, hey, Walter!
Nice to see you again.
Hi, Elaine.
Hi.
Hey, you guys come here all the time, right?
You got anything to recommend to make the dining experience a memorable one?
Yeah, they got a great air hockey game in the back room.
Hey, come on.
They do.
I know.
Uh, we'll see you later.
Would you care for another round?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Uh, I'll have another.
He hates me.
Who?
The waiter.
I know when a man despises me and that man despises me.
He's going to spit in my food.
They do that.
Could we go back to sweating?
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.
Hi, Louie.
Hello, Nardo.
Is this your date for the evening?
You remember me, Congressman Walter Griswold.
Yeah.
What, they run out of towels in the men's room?
No, that's, uh, that's sweat.
I was telling Elaine, I sweat a lot.
Congratulations.
Well, uh, I don't want to destroy your magical tete-a-tete.
See you later.
He's a nice guy.
Oh, yeah, a prince.
Talk about a lame duck.
Hey, come on, Louie.
Walter's a nice guy.
He's a United States Congressman.
I don't care if he's the Duke of Cornwall.
In my book, the guy's a shlimazl.
What's a shlimazl?
Well, you see, there's schlemiels and shlimazls.
A schlemiel is a guy who goes to a formal dinner party and spills his soup.
A shlimazl's the guy he spills it on.
Hey, Louie, you know what's good about you?
What?
I was hoping you had an answer.
Have, uh, have you decided yet, Elaine?
Um I'm not sure.
Walter, your menu's on fire.
Walter, uh I think I'll start with the chocolate cheesecake.
Boy, this guy.
He is a horse's yatabe.
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, Elaine.
It's the same old story.
A girl goes out with me, I embarrass her.
It's no wonder they never want to see me again.
I never want to see me again.
I didn't say I didn't want to see you again.
Oh, yeah?
You want to go out Saturday night?
Oh, no, Saturday, I made these See?
See?
What about Sunday?
No, I take the kids Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
What about Monday?
Monday's a bad day.
Mm-hmm.
Tuesday?
Well it's fine.
What?
I'd love to.
You want to go out with me again?
Yes, Walter.
What's wrong with you?
Can you believe Elaine?
Getting mixed up with a loser like that?
She's gone out with him every night for the past two weeks.
Look, Why do we have to talk about Walter anymore?
We all have our good days and our bad days.
Then Walter's got some great days ahead.
What are you guys talking about?
Boxing.
Work.
School.
General stuff.
Must have been a hell of a conversation.
Well, Nardo Has it happened yet?
What?
Has one of your kisses turned the toad into a prince?
Louie, you take that back.
Nardo, do you know what a shlimazl is?
I don't have to listen to this.
A sclimazl is a guy who comes home from work early and finds his wife in bed with his boss, then gets docked a day's pay for leaving the office.
And with a little more class, Walter would be a shlimazl.
Louie, I am warning you.
Now watch it.
Listen, Nardo if you ever grab me again in a non-erogenous zone, you're gone.
Ugh.
Alex, I need your advice.
Ooh!
What?
Okay, look, unless it's about you and Walter, because I don't want to get in the middle of that.
It's about me and Walter.
All right.
If you just want to talk and it's no big stuff It's gigantic stuff.
Well, I mean, if it doesn't get really intimate You can't get more intimate.
In that case, shoot.
Well I guess everybody's really curious about why I'm seeing him so much.
Well, I'm not.
I understand.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I mean, he's not the man of my dreams, but I like him.
I guess like him for the same reason I'm drawn to that scrawny little puppy in the pet store you know, that nobody else wants.
Well, whatever your reasons, I really got to hand it to you, Elaine, you know?
Dating you has really changed Walter.
He seems like he's got a lot more confidence in himself now.
You know that?
I know.
You're right.
Oh, he is such a sweet guy.
You know how some guys treat your kids nice?
Yeah.
Well, Walter's not just treating them nice.
I mean, he really likes my kids.
Oh, yeah?
The other day my daughter came home upset because three of her best friends were going to see The Nutcracker without her.
The mother couldn't get an extra ticket and so she was the only one left out.
Well, I'm giving her this big lecture, telling her it's no big deal and you shouldn't be so upset about it, you know, but she wouldn't stop crying.
So I look over at Walter, and he's got tears in his eyes.
So then I got them both on my hands.
So, what'd you do?
I took them both to see The Nutcracker.
What's your problem?
I got to break up with him.
Oh, Elaine, no.
I know, Alex.
I'm sorry, but I have no choice.
Walter's beginning to make certain suggestions.
Like what?
Like, "How about a roll in the hay"?
Walter's suggestions seem to run toward the blunt, don't they?
Yeah.
I mean, I like him, but there's just not that chemistry thing.
So what do you want me to say, I understand?
I understand.
What are you getting so sore about?
I'm not sore.
I mean, you want advice?
You want to break up with Walter, fine.
Just go on your own instincts, those same instincts that have gotten you this far-- divorced, poor, working nights, holding two jobs.
Alex, will you calm down for a second?
Now listen to me.
This man is coming over tonight.
We're gonna be alone.
My kids are with my ex-husband.
I don't know if I can handle this.
Elaine, do you really expect me to tell you whether you should roll in the hay or not with Walter?
I guess you're right.
Oh, I got to do what I got to do.
I just know it's going to break his heart.
Oh.
You're going to go to bed with him.
You're sure you don't want anything?
Maybe just a little applause.
No, I haven't got time.
I'll just have a cup of coffee Babe.
Uh Say, can we talk about No, no.
I guess we shouldn't.
It's not a thing you talk about.
Walter, it's okay to talk about it.
I've never sweat so much in my entire life.
Elaine, be honest with me.
Did you let me stay last night because you wanted to, or because you felt sorry for me?
Or did I just catch up with the law of averages?
Walter, I let you stay because I care about you.
Isn't that reason enough?
Yeah.
Elaine, I had a little time to think before you woke up this morning seven, eight hours I have a great idea.
Why don't you and I agree not to see anyone else.
Walter Okay, okay, I'll just agree not to see anyone else, but when can I see you again?
What do you mean?
Well, now that we've done this, I want to know when I can see you and for how long, and can you write this down for me?
Walter, listen to me.
This was just what I was afraid of.
I pushed too far, right?
Well All right, all right.
Don't worry about that, don't worry about that.
We don't have to go steady or anything but I'd appreciate it if you'd meet my parents.
Walter I can make a call now.
There are flights leaving all hours.
Walter, you want to fly your parents to New York because of what we did last night?
It's a shuttle.
It'll be great.
You'll bring the kids and we'll go and see The Nutcracker.
Walter!
I'm screwing up.
I'm screwing up.
Walter, now, stop.
Just listen to me.
It's too much.
You're scaring me.
You're trying to chart our entire relationship in one morning.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I tend to make too much of these things.
Oh, forgive me, Elaine.
It was a wonderful evening.
Maybe we'll see each other again.
Good-bye, Elaine.
Were you missing me at all, because I was dying out there.
You are such a lovely man.
Hey, I want our relationship to continue.
Can't we just leave it at that?
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
We should just take it slow.
Take it as it comes.
Right.
Play it by ear.
How about every Thursday night for the next three months?
Is 8:00 okay?
See?
I told you we'd make it.
Hey, listen, you've got 15 minutes before your plane takes off.
Good.
So, how'd it go with you and Elaine last night?
Fine.
Oh, that's good.
Yes, fine is very good.
You do anything out of the ordinary?
No.
It was, I guess, an ordinary evening for most people.
Now listen, Alex.
I know you want to know what took place between Elaine and me, but there are some things a gentleman does not discuss.
Oh, I understand, Walter.
I'll probably see you next time I'm back in town.
Yeah, I'll see you, Walter.
Oh, and Walter Yeah?
Congratulations.
Thanks.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
All right now, we got some cabs to get out here.
Ryan-- 1620.
Arnie-- 214.
Hey, cha-cha, get out of that cab.
Cavalucci-- 916.
Wheeler-- 1136.
Uh, skip Bobby.
He isn't in yet.
He isn't in yet?
A doctor isn't in yet.
A cabbie is late.
It's all right.
He had a good excuse.
I'll accept "dead".
He had an important audition this afternoon for an acting job.
Hey, an audition.
That's great.
Well, not great.
He had it this afternoon.
I figured he isn't in yet because he didn't get the part and he's feeling depressed.
Oh.
The old shattered dreams bit, huh?
Well, if he thinks he's depressed now, wait till I get through with him.
Hey, Bob.
Wheeler.
You're late and I don't want to hear any lame excuses.
I don't want to hear about your other troubles.
I got a garage to run here.
Don't smile at me when I'm yelling at you.
What's the matter with you?
You on something?
Why ain't he looking miserable?
I got the job.
You what?
You got it?
I got the part.
They told me right there at the audition.
I'm gonna make two appearances on a soap opera called For Better For Worse.
Television?
That is terrific.
My man!
Unbelievable.
Bushgalay.
Being on a soap opera is not what I always dreamed of, but it's a start.
It's a chance to be seen.
I can still work on my craft.
I can still develop my technique.
And pick up a hell of a lot of bread.
Hey, when does this happen?
I mean, when do we get to see you?
I make my first appearance on Friday and then I'm on again Tuesday, and then, like, if things go real well I could maybe, well, you know like, maybe it'll go on longer, you know?
You mean full-time?
Well, I don't know yet.
Let me tell you the plot line, okay?
I play this guy named Skip.
I was a boyfriend of the star's, right?
We had this argument four years ago and I left town mad, only then I got amnesia and wandered around in a fog somewhere the whole time, but now I'm recovered and I'm coming back home.
I just don't believe it.
This is so exciting.
Thrilling.
Hey, Louie, the least you can do is congratulate the man.
You got cab 1136.
Congratulations.
All right, come on, you clowns.
Let's get going here.
Let's get some meat behind the wheel.
Bobby?
I would like to wish you bad luck.
No.
You mean good luck, Latka.
No, no.
You see, in my country, it is bad luck to wish a person good luck.
So when we want to wish a person good luck, we say "bad luck".
Oh.
That's an interesting custom.
Uh, what do you do when you want somebody to have bad luck?
We kick him in the yatabe.
For Better For Worse will continue after this message.
What do you think so far?
You weren't in it.
It's not over yet.
You see, I'm on after this commercial.
What I meant was, what do you think of the way they've been talking about me throughout the whole show?
They're giving me a big buildup, right?
It's neat just hearing the name Skip and knowing it's you.
I never thought I'd see the day when my cabbies would be watching a TV show instead of out making big bucks.
I'm ashamed.
I can't help thinking of all the people out there waiting for taxis that ain't coming-- all the old people, and the sick, and the infirm, and the preggos.
Boy, you know, that Olivia, she's really a good actress.
In that last scene where she was supposed to be crying, those were real tears.
She cries in every scene.
She cries if she's happy, she cries if she's sad, she cries if she doesn't know if she's happy or sad.
Hey, she's going to cry again.
Turn up the sound.
Olivia, relax.
You're as nervous as a cat.
I haven't seen Skip in four years.
I thought I'd never see him again.
Wouldn't you be nervous?
There's so much I have to tell him.
You mean, about you and David?
Hey, you can't feel guilty.
You can't blame yourself for what's happened.
Skip's amnesia wasn't your fault.
I know.
I just keep thinking if we hadn't fought, all this would never have happened.
But it did happen and a lot has changed in four years.
Skip can't expect you to have the same feelings for him.
I suppose not.
Unless Unless what?
Nothing.
No, no.
Go on.
You were going to say unless I do have the same feelings for him.
Well do you?
I don't know.
How can I tell until I've seen him again?
That's Skip now.
Come in.
Hello.
Skip Gee, what a heavy moment.
Yeah, that was very dramatic, you know?
So, uh, you liked it then, right?
Liked it?
Liked it?
We loved it.
Hey, how come they only let you say one word?
It makes it more dramatic that way.
This way everybody will tune back on Monday to see what happens.
What happens?
I don't know yet.
They actually don't get back to us until Tuesday.
I'm waiting for them to deliver the script now so I can find out myself.
Oh, wow.
Thanks, John.
Hey, Bob, Bob.
If she's falling for you again, that means you get to do more than just two shows, right?
My agent says that if they develop a thing between her and me, I could get a season out of it.
Wouldn't that be great?
I could save my money and wait for a really good part.
Oh, come on script.
Hey, I don't want to burst your bubble but you think Olivia is going to dump that David guy for you?
No way.
The girl is nuts about him.
She even forgave him for having an affair with her uncle.
Hey Louie, are you telling us that you watch this show regularly?
My mother watches it.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
I'd make her turn it off only it's a half hour a day I don't have to talk to her.
Yap, yap, yap.
Bobby Wheeler?
Over here.
Oh, boy, is that my script?
Yep.
Oh, great.
Just initial.
I'm holding my future in my hands.
Well, come on-- you going to tell us what happens?
I already told you what's going to happen.
I don't believe it.
What?
What?
What?
What?
Read what Olivia says there.
"Olivia, with tears in her eyes: 'I love Skip.
'" She says she loves me.
Look what it says over here.
"Olivia, sobbing incessantly: "'I knew it the instant I saw him again-- he's the only man in the world I could ever love.
'" Hey, Bobby, you're in!
You're in!
Hey, fantastic!
Let me see that.
That means you're going to do more shows?
A lot more.
I'm going to be a full-time actor.
That's the first time in my life I can say that.
I'm an actor.
You son of a gun, you did it.
I made it, Alex.
I made it out of the garage.
I hope your career goes in the toilet.
Thanks a lot, Latka, really.
See, in his country, they got this strange custom Don't explain.
Hey, Louie.
Hey, Lou.
Here.
I want you to keep this as a remembrance of me.
It's my hack license.
Now you can show it to all your friends and tell them, "I knew him when".
You better hang on to it, Wheeler, 'cause you're going to need it when you come crawling back in here.
You got it all wrong, Louie.
When I walk out of those doors, I ain't never coming back.
Oh, you'll be back.
They all come back.
Only one guy ever made it out in the whole history of this garage and that was James Caan and he'll be back.
You're a loser, Wheeler.
You always was, and you always will be.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
You'll be back, Wheeler and when you come back, I'll be waiting.
Ooh, will I be waiting.
: Wouldn't you be nervous?
There's so much What are you guys doing here?
Why'd they have to come here.
You can't feel guilty.
You can't blame yourself.
Surprise.
Come on.
It's freezing.
How you doing, John?
What are you guys doing here anyway?
Well, we were wondering why we didn't see you around the garage for a couple of weeks, and so we wondered how you were.
And where you were.
We figure you've been busy with the show.
Yeah.
Watching the show I see, huh?
Hey, Bobby, if this is a bad time, we can leave and come back later.
Or not come back again.
Listen, we realize things change.
I mean, we realize that your life is very different now and maybe there's not enough room in it for a bunch of cabbies like us.
Is that why you guys came over here?
'Cause you thought I didn't want to hang around anymore?
Well, we didn't really think that.
Oh, yeah, you did.
I didn't return your phone calls, so you thought I got stuck up or something, right?
Why didn't you return our calls?
'Cause I didn't feel like it.
Oh, well, that clears that up, doesn't it?
I didn't feel like it because I was too depressed.
Depressed?
About what?
Julia, you're the first one I'm telling.
Skip and I Skip and I are going to be married.
Hey, married-- congratulations!
Shh!
Shh!
Olivia, I'm so happy for you.
I know it's what you want.
Hello?
Yes, this is she.
What?
Oh, no!
Oh my God, no!
Olivia, what is it?
It's Skip.
He's been rushed to the hospital.
He's had an accident.
Accident?
When?
How?
What happened?
When?
How?
What happened?
Oh, no.
Olivia don't cry.
I can't help it.
I want to Shhh, don't try to talk.
I have to.
I have to.
I have to.
I I love you.
Remember.
It's going to be all right.
You'll see.
I'm I'm just glad that we had time Skip Skip!
Oh, God no!
He's dead.
Skip's dead.
No wonder you're depressed, Bobby.
Poor guy.
Yeah, it doesn't seem fair.
First amnesia and now this.
He's talking about Bobby.
Bobby?
Bobby's young.
Bobby's still got his health.
What chance has Skip got?
Oh, I'm really sorry, Bobby.
If it makes you feel any better, you really did a beautiful job.
Thanks.
I take it you saw this coming?
Yeah, they told me two weeks ago.
They said they liked my work and everything, but figured Olivia needed more tragedy in her life.
Right, she hadn't had a good cry in seconds.
So when's the funeral?
Anyway That's why I didn't call you guys.
I just wasn't up to it, you know?
So, any idea what you're going to do now?
What else?
I'm going to get a job.
I have to.
So, fine, come back to the garage.
No way.
I walked out of there the conquering hero.
What am I going to look like if I come back now?
You'll look like the rest of us.
I just don't think, I can do it, Alex.
Why not?
Oh, it's Louie, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.
It sure is Louie.
If I come back there now, he is going to tear me apart in front of the whole garage.
So what, he's done that before.
Yeah, but this time he's got a right to.
Maybe I should just go back there and let him dance all over my face and get it over with.
Hey, look, maybe it won't be so bad as you think.
Look, I'll see you back in the garage, okay?
Hey, wait a minute.
It's coming back on.
Shh!
Poor Skip.
I didn't even get a chance to tell him.
Tell him what?
I'm going to have his baby.
Way to go, Bobby.
Hey, Louie, can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure, Alex.
What's on your mind?
Well, you know Bobby's run into some rotten luck.
I know.
I saw the show.
Har, har, har.
Louie, Louie, look, you know, acting is Bobby's dream.
I mean, it's his soul.
It's his reason for living.
You know, to have a dream like that come true, to have it finally within your grasp, and then to lose it all again, do you have any idea how he must feel?
Like hell.
Louie, Louie, listen, listen to me.
He's coming in any minute.
No kidding!
Louie, all he wants is to have his old job back.
Louie, Louie, Louie!
Louie!
Look, you just got to do me one big favor, okay?
Now, it's a very hard thing for Bobby to come back here like this.
So please, don't make him feel any worse than he does, okay?
Ooh, am I going to love this.
I am going to love it.
Louie, come here.
Sit down.
Please, sit down.
I don't know how to get through to you.
Look, um Look, we all know each other very well in this garage, right?
We know you and how you act, and we all accept that, but this is something very special.
Now I'm asking you the best way I know how-- When Bobby walks through that door, please, just leave him alone.
Okay?
You really mean this, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Well then, I guess there's only one thing I can say.
Blow it out your ear, Rieger!
When Wheeler walks through that door I am going to give it to him like I have never given it to nobody.
I am going to rub his nose in it.
I am going to make him squeal like an eel and squirm like a worm.
That does it, Louie!
You just got me angry.
Ooh, I'm trembling in my booties.
Well, you better tremble because you've just gone too far.
You think humiliating people is fun, don't you?
You think you're pretty cute this way, don't you?
I am cute.
No, you're not cute, Louie, and you're not clever.
It's not hard to humiliate people.
It's not hard to make people feel rotten about their lives.
The difficult thing is to make people feel good about their lives.
Humiliating them, that's simple.
I'll show you how simple it is.
Here, take a look at this.
Simple, huh?
What the hell are you doing?
I was just giving you a lesson, Louie, on how easy it is to make people feel ridiculous.
You see that?
You're crazy!
The man is crazy!
He's a whack!
Louie, come here!
Ha-ha-ha!
Your friend, Wheeler, is a loser, Rieger and I'm going to tell him he's a loser and I'm going to love telling him he's a loser.
* He's a loser * He's a loser * Nyah, nyah, nyah * He's a loser, he's a loser * He's a loser * He's a loser You're not finished yet?
Louie, I'm warning you-- Don't screw around with Bobby, you hear me?
What do you mean, you're warning me?
Are you threatening me with physical violence, Alex?
I'm not saying it won't work.
I just want to know.
No, I'm not threatening you.
Well, do you got something on me?
Are you blackmailing me?
I'm just telling you this very simply, Louie.
Don't do what you're thinking of doing to Bobby.
Just don't do it.
Oh, yeah?
Why not?
Because you shouldn't.
I shouldn't?
That's the reason I shouldn't?
I shouldn't?
I shouldn't?
I shouldn't!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
I shouldn't.
I shouldn't!
You shouldn't, you shouldn't!
I shouldn't.
Nice having you back, Bobby.
Hey, Louie.
Listen, I got to tell you, I was really knocked out when I came in here yesterday and you were so nice to me.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I want to tell you, I really appreciate it.
I thought you were going to dump on me and say things like, uh "Well.
"If it isn't the big movie star.
"Come back to sign autographs?
"You got a movie contract yet, bigshot?
"Ooh, ooh, why, you look just like the poor slob "who walked out of here a few weeks ago swearing he was never going to come back".
"What a loser"!
You like that?
Ooh-- oh, Bobby.
I wouldn't have said no things like that.
Naw.
But I probably would have said "Here comes the great ac-tor "bringing his aura into our crummy garage.
"I'm glad they finally found a role worthy of your talents-- A stiff"!
And then I might have turned on the PA like this and I might have said, "Hey, everybody "you remember Bobby Wheeler when he was a nobody?
"Then you won't have any problems recognizing him now.
"Come on.
"Gather 'round and see how a famous actor eats crow".
But I guess I'm just too nice a guy for that.
Yeah, well, thanks a lot for not doing that, Louie.
Don't mention it.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Hi, Louie.
I'm back.
Back from what?
I took a week off to study for my finals.
You didn't even notice I wasn't here?
I don't even notice you now.
Thanks.
It's nice to be back.
Hi, everybody.
I'm back from my finals.
What finals?
Do I have the right garage?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Your finals, right.
Oh, yeah!
Sorry, John, we've just had other things on our minds.
Yeah.
These guys from Hollywood are coming here today.
They're going to make this big movie on cab drivers.
They're going to do research right here in the garage.
Wow!
Who's coming?
Well, you know Roger Chapman, that big director?
Yeah.
He's coming, and Michael Patrese, the star.
He's starred in that flick.
He's coming, too.
Michael Patrese, now he's a good actor, isn't he?
Yeah.
He's got a lot of potential.
You know, if he really applies himself and concentrates, one day he could be as big as Brando, Pacino me, you know.
Bob, maybe there's a part in this movie for you.
Gee, why didn't I think of that?
Hi.
Hi, Alex.
Hey, John!
How did your finals go?
What finals?
Isn't it incredible?
Some movie people from Hollywood are coming to the garage.
Oh, is that today?
Alex, aren't you excited?
Sure.
So, how did your finals go?
What was it?
Multiple choice?
Essays?
What was it?
Essay.
Excuse me, Alex.
How come you're more interested in my life than I am?
Yeah.
Huh?
Hey, somebody just pulled up in a limousine.
This is ridiculous.
We look like a bunch of groupies.
Don't hang around the door.
Come on.
Well, what do you want us to do, Bobby?
I don't know.
Do what you normally do.
Act natural, act Play cards or something.
Make believe Oh, come on, come on Yeah.
See what I mean?
This is why we came to New York.
You can't stage this kind of reality.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for a Mr. Louie De Palma.
That's me.
Hi.
I'm Roger Chapman.
I spoke to your boss, Mr. McKenzie.
Right, right.
How are you, sir?
Listen, if there's anything I can do to make your visit here more pleasant or productive, just say the word.
Okay.
Boy, this place is thick with atmosphere.
Yeah, well, sometimes the ventilation's bad.
Where do you want to start?
Well, I'd like to say a few words to the drivers.
Oh.
I think it would be good if I talked to them first.
Uh-huh.
See, I used to be a driver, and I have a special rapport with them.
Okay.
All right?
Okay, clowns, listen up here.
And shut your mouths.
This man has something to say to you.
Was that satisfactory?
You bet.
Thank you.
Gather in here.
All right.
My name is Roger Chapman.
Hi.
Yeah, we know.
This is my assistant, Lea, and my aide, Richard.
Hey, Richard.
Now, I just want to kind of let you people know where I'm coming from.
We're gonna make a movie about cab drivers, and the reason we're here is we want reality.
Not Hollywood reality.
We want real reality.
So, we want to we want to live with you guys.
We want to eat with you and talk with you and-and get inside your heads.
You know, why don't you forget we're from Hollywood, and forget we're even making a movie.
We're just some people who-who would like to find out what it's like to drive a cab.
Now, anybody have any questions?
Okay, you.
How'd they part the Red Sea in The Ten Commandments?
Uh, he-he's only clowning around.
What's wrong with you?
Hey, listen, have you all had breakfast?
No.
No.
'Cause I was just thinking of ordering something for all of us.
What do you guys want?
No.
Oh No, come on.
Hey, every morning we are here, I'm going to bring in whatever you guys ask for.
So, what will it be?
Well, I'll have some coffee.
Yeah, and some doughnuts.
You can have anything.
Anything at all.
Jelly doughnuts?
Gotcha.
Oh!
Hey, Michael!
Michael, Michael, you're here.
How you doing?
Sorry I'm late.
That's all right.
I just got here myself.
Everybody this is Michael Patrese.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, Tony Banta.
How you doing?
Hey.
Hey, uh, Bobby here wants to be an actor, too.
Oh, Tony Come on!
You know you want to be an actor.
Aw, Tony!
Come on!
Michael Patrese.
Hi.
Can you get me a part in the picture?
I think we'd better get started right away.
Uh, let me tell you what we have so far.
We have a script but it's not a particularly good one.
It just doesn't have any, um guts.
It's the story of a it's the story of a cabby named Joe.
He's a good driver.
He's been at it for some time, and And that's all we have.
The rest of it's going to have to come from you people.
We want to hear all of your stories, and maybe one of your stories is Joe's story.
Hey, you know, the guy you really ought to talk to is Alex Rieger.
He's got the best stories.
Okay, which one of you is Alex?
Uh He's over there.
Okay.
Thank you.
Alex?
Hi.
Roger Chapman.
Hi.
Alex Rieger.
Great.
Listen, can we talk for a few moments?
Uh, listen, I, uh I mean, I don't know you.
You're probably a very decent guy, but You're right.
You don't know me.
This is some kind of joke, right?
Yeah.
Little one.
Listen, I, uh I'm, uh I just wish you, uh you wouldn't count me into this, huh?
Hey, hey, Alex, all he wants to do is ask you a few questions.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I just don't feel like answering any questions.
Look, I'm a cabby.
You want me to take you someplace, I'll take you someplace.
There's a reason you call your private life private, and if I was to talk about it with somebody I don't know, well, it just wouldn't be private anymore.
So, uh I'm sorry.
Excuse me, will you?
I'll see you all tomorrow.
That's our Joe.
Well, uh, thanks for breakfast.
Oh, my pleasure.
Listen, I hope you don't mind my picking your brain that way.
Some of those stories were just great.
Thanks.
Some of them even happened.
You know what?
Has anyone ever told you you look a little like a young Lana Turner?
No.
'Cause you don't.
But you know what?
You're very pretty.
Thanks.
And I had a wonderful, wonderful morning.
This guy's got the fastest left hook you've ever seen.
That's right, yeah.
Tony, you're a boxer, aren't you?
Yeah.
We were just talking about next week's title fight, next Thursday night.
You got tickets?
Yeah.
Sure.
Lea?
Get Tony a seat for that fight Thursday night.
Okay.
Ringside.
Gee, thanks!
Bobby, I'm going to go to the fight.
That's great!
Oh you need two tickets.
You've got a girlfriend.
Well, not right now.
Well, Lea here is kind of a boxing fan, you know.
Would you mind taking her?
I guess I could.
Oh, he doesn't have to.
No, that's the kind of guy I am.
Okay.
I'll go make the arrangements.
You lucky stiff.
Well I'm going to sit in the first row of the fight, and I'm not even going to have to get knocked out of the ring to get there.
Hope it's a good one, Tony.
Thanks.
Oh!
Excuse me, Mr. Chapman?
Yeah.
Food's here.
Food.
I had the eggs Benedict.
Mr. Chapman?
Yeah?
Excuse me, Mr. Chapman?
Listen, I think I might have a very interesting thing for you.
Well, go ahead, John, shoot.
Okay, well, about four months ago, this guy jumped into my cab and he says, "Take me to 54th Street".
When we get there, he says  He says he says He says, "My God!
They've torn the building down".
It turns out instead of taking him to 54th Street, I'd taken him to 53rd Street.
Huh?
When we found out, you know, we were both so amused, we just sat there and laughed.
It was As any of us would, John.
Tell me, do you, uh do you have a lot of stories like this?
Well, they're not all as good as that one, but, uh Yeah, I could tell you a few.
One time, this girl came in You know, John, John, John, John I have a better idea.
Why don't you write them all down as they occur to you, then scoop them up in a big pile.
Then bring them to me, and I'll see that they get just the treatment they deserve.
And fast.
Oh, great.
Thanks.
I'll go get started.
You do that.
Thanks.
Excuse me, Mr. De Palma.
Uh-huh?
Listen, there's, uh, something I'd like to ask you.
Shoot.
Well, we've heard that certain dispatchers will take advantage of their position by taking bribes you know, shaking down drivers, that sort of thing.
Is there any truth in that?
What's it worth to you to find out?
I think you just answered my question.
Thank you.
Hey, Alex, you want some pigs in a blanket?
Oh, actually, I was on my way to Mario's.
Anyone want to come?
Are you kidding?
The food at Mario's is terrible compared to this.
They use horse meat for hamburgers.
You're crazy.
Take my word for it.
Who are you?
The cook at Mario's.
Oh.
You know, Alex, I think I know how you feel about talking to me, and I I want to tell you I respect you for it.
But you know, I got a hunch about you.
I think that you can really help this picture, and I'm not going to leave you alone until I get what I want, you know?
I didn't get where I where I am in this business today by taking no for an answer.
Or by taking no answer for an answer.
Look, Alex, you hang out here and I'm going to be around you every minute.
You'd just better face it.
I'm going to bug you like crazy until I get what I want.
Hey, look, I don't have to take this.
You know, we got a union here, we got rules.
Hey, Louie, Louie, where's the shop steward?
Where is he?
Who is he?
I want to see the shop steward.
Hey, you know, we're supposed to have one.
It's a union rule that says one of the drivers is supposed to be the representative from the union.
Yeah, come on.
Anybody know who he is?
Get him in here, because I got a grievance.
All right, all right, keep your pants on.
I'll look him up here.
Um Ben Goretski is the shop steward.
Ben?
Ben Goretski to the cage.
I never heard of him.
That's because he's been dead for two years.
Never mind, Ben.
Wow, looks like we're going to have to elect a new one.
Oh, I nominate Alex.
Oh, come on, now, Elaine.
Don't!
Yeah, it's a good idea.
All right.
All those in favor of Alex being our new shop steward say "aye".
Aye!
Wait a minute!
Look, I don't want to be the shop steward.
We can't force him into it.
Well, why don't we just let Ben Goretski keep doing it?
He's been doing a good job.
All those in favor of keeping Ben Goretski as our shop steward say "aye".
Aye!
The ayes have it.
Ben if you can hear me, congratulations.
Okay, what do you want to know?
You know, this is the best pate we've had all week.
Hi, Tony.
How was the fight?
Great, great.
Yeah?
Who won?
I don't know.
Lea and I left early.
Boy, I hope we get to fit in another fight before you have to leave town.
Oh Hi, everybody.
Hi, Alex.
Hey, have you had breakfast yet?
The sturgeon is really good today.
I just had breakfast with Roger.
You know, I told him things I haven't thought of in years.
Yeah?
Is he going to use some of your stories?
Well, he said they were very interesting, but they weren't really right for the movie.
He said they were more like television.
You know, after all that fuss I made, I really have to admit it's been it's been a lot of fun.
Boy!
I can understand these other dummies being taken in by those Hollywood phonies, but I thought you had more sense, Rieger.
What are you talking about?
Big Hollywood picture.
Multimillion-dollar budget.
They come in here, disrupt the garage, make all kinds of extra work for me, and don't even offer me a dime for my troubles.
If I hadn't been selling the leftovers to Mario's, this week would have been a total loss.
Good morning, Louie.
How are you?
Roger.
Hey, hi.
Thanks for breakfast, really.
My pleasure.
Thank you.
Hi.
Hi, Mr. Chapman.
I'm almost finished with my stories.
Great news, John.
Listen, we're going to have to go back to Hollywood tomorrow.
Yeah.
But I just wanted to tell you that we're going to have a little get-together up at my suite at the Plaza tonight, about 8:15  And we'd love to have all of you.
Hey, we'll be there.
Don't worry about it.
Oh, also, the biggest news-- Louie, come on down here.
This concerns you, too.
If your caterer is missing any silverware, I had nothing to do with it.
No.
I was talking to your boss, Mr. McKenzie, and I told him how we want to shoot this picture on location in New York.
And I asked him if it was all right with him to shoot some of the scenes right here in the garage and use all the drivers as extras.
And Bobby I think there's a part in this film for you.
Oh, wow!
That's great!
Wait, wait.
Did McKenzie agree?
Yeah.
He said it was fine with him.
He said just as long as Louie didn't object.
You mean it's up to me whether you guys come back and shoot your picture here?
Uh, yeah, Louie.
Um, well, we'd be here for over a month, and he was worried that you might think it would be a little too disruptive for the garage.
You mean that it's entirely up to me.
Well, uh, yes, Louie, it is.
So, uh, so what do you say?
You going to let us make a movie right here in your garage?
Mr. Chapman I ain't letting you take a snapshot in this garage.
Hey, man, what's the matter?
Why not, Louie?
No.
He's been in here all week disrupting the whole operation.
I can't take a month of that.
Oh, terrific.
Thanks a lot.
Well, you know, Louie, uh we might try to make it worth your while.
A bribe?
Well, Louie, if we have to build a whole garage set out on a lot in Hollywood, that's going to cost us a lot of money.
Well, since you're putting it in those terms, Mr. Chapman, perhaps we could do a little business.
Would you like a little drink here?
Yeah.
How about yourself?
Oh, sure, I'll have one.
There's for you.
Okay.
And for me.
Just, uh, what sort of figure did you have in mind?
Well, let's say we make you location coordinator.
And we pay you $15,000?
Hmm Well, that's not exactly the sort of figure that I had in mind, but what the heck?
You got yourself a deal.
Great.
Okay, and I'll see you at the Plaza tonight.
All of you.
Later, Rog.
Bye-bye.
We'll be there, Rog.
Bye, Roger.
Hey, Louie what sort of figure did you have in mind?
I was going to ask him for $25.
Well, here's to a great picture, a bunch of great people, and to friendship.
Am I forgetting anything?
Yeah.
To $15,000.
How much did it cost to stay here, Lea?
Oh, it cost about $225 a day.
Wow.
Hey, Rog!
You're crazy spending that kind of cash.
Next time you're in town, you come stay with me.
Well, I guess when we get back to New York, you're going to be seeing a lot more of Lea, huh?
Boy, I sure hope so.
But, uh, I don't think she has any more.
Excuse me, Mr. Chapman?
Yeah?
It's Peter Koppelman from Hollywood.
Peter who?
Koppelman.
He's head of production at Paramount.
No.
John Muncie is head of production at Paramount.
No, there's been some sort of shakeup.
Koppelman, who used to be with Universal, is now at Paramount.
Hawthorne, from Columbia, is now head of production at Universal.
And Lou Green from MGM is taking over Columbia.
Then where the hell is Muncie?
He's at Burger King.
Never mind, just give me the phone.
Hello, Peter?
Hey, congratulations, man.
It couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Yeah, listen, I know you're probably way over your head getting settled in out there in the new job, and all, but have you had a chance to look at that cab driver script yet?
You did?
Oh, great.
Right.
I didn't like it either.
You see?
And that's why I sent it to you to read.
Right, uh, but what do you think of the idea?
You're canceling the project?
Peter, I have two years of my life in this thing.
Listen, I Peter?
Listen, Peter, we we have some fantastic stuff here.
We've got wonderful, warm human stories.
Don't say no, man, until you've heard them!
Wait Alex, Alex, tell him the one about the baby that was born in your cab.
Huh?
Make it twins!
: Make it twins.
Uh, hello, Mr. Koppelman?
My name is Alex Rieger.
Uh, yeah, I was really thinking that this would be right for television, but I don't see why it can't transfer to the big screen.
Just tell him the story.
Oh.
Uh, well It was a very cold night early in January, and You hate it already?
How can you hate it already?
Lea, you used to go out with him.
You talk to him.
No, not with Koppelman.
Just with Muncie and Hawthorne.
I used to go out with him.
Give me the phone!
Hello?
Hello, Mr. Koppelman.
Uh, this is Louie De Palma, your location coordinator.
You can't cancel this picture.
I already told my mother about the $15,000.
She thinks we're moving to Queens.
No, please, Mr. Koppelman!
Please.
I'm begging you.
I'm begging I'm on my knees, Mr. Koppelman.
Please, please, you got to listen to me, please!
Louie, Louie, Louie!
Control yourself, will you?
What do you mean, who the hell am I?
I just told you!
I'm Louie De Palma, your location coordinator.
Now, listen to me, Koppelman.
I'm warning you, you cancel this picture, you're going to wake up tomorrow with one of your horses' heads in your bed.
Koppelman, I swear, you cancel this picture, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
Can you believe that?
He hung up on me.
The nerve of some people.
$15,000!
Louie, Louie, Louie.
: $15,000!
All right, Louie, Louie, listen, listen.
$15,000!
Louie, please.
Look, you just had a bad break.
Now, come on.
$15,000!
Come on, you couldn't help it.
$15,000!
There's nothing you could do about it.
Louie, come on, Louie, Louie!
You just got to be a man, Louie.
Louie, Louie, look.
Fifteen You got to walk out of here You got to walk out of here with this head held high, you hear me?
Hmm?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just want to go into the bathroom for a moment.
Yeah.
You're right, Alex.
I got to keep my head up high.
As long as a man has his pride and his dignity, it doesn't matter what this rotten world tries to do to him.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hey, Lou, you'll never believe what happened to me.
What's that?
I pick up this fare at the airport, right?
Some foreign guy.
So he tells me, "Take me to the Plaza Hotel," which I do.
When I get there, there's $17 on the meter.
The guy takes out a hundred-dollar bill and asks me, "Is this enough"?
Ooh, my Lord whoo!
Ooh, you lucky slob.
Cabbie heaven!
Oh, you know, I drove a cab 15 years, waiting for something like that to happen.
It was really wild.
Ooh, a hundred dollars.
Ooh, you must be living right, Banta.
What'd you do with the money?
I gave him $83 change.
Hey, Louie!
Oy!
You okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
I think I need a cold drink.
What happened to him?
Oh, Alex, I'm so glad I caught you.
Listen, I have a big favor to ask you.
I just found out that my aunt up in Buffalo is sick, so I'm gonna go up there to spend a couple days with her.
I'm taking Jennifer with me, but my problem is Jason.
See, he's got this big spelling bee competition and the district finals are this Saturday.
I'd hate to have him miss it after he's come this far.
So, do you think it would be all right if he stayed with you a couple of days?
Oh, please don't feel pressured into saying yes, but please say yes.
What was that, Elaine?
I-I wasn't listening.
Oh, ah, yeah, sure, sure.
Yeah, yeah, I'd be glad to.
Why not?
Oh, Alex, you're a doll!
Oh, thanks so much.
Oh, he-he's just in the car.
I'll go get him.
Thanks.
You don't have to thank me-- it'd be fun.
I don't want to do this.
What am I talking about?
I can't do this.
Thursday I'm supposed to have dinner with my sister.
Friday I've got this really great date.
Hey, Bobby, can you help me out?
Sure, I'll take your date out.
What's she look like?
Bob-Bobby, come on, will you?
Aah, Alex, I don't know anything about taking care of kids.
Oh, all right.
I'll help you out Thursday, but Friday I got an acting class, all right?
Great, great.
Okay.
Hey, Tony, can you help me out Friday?
I guess I could, uh Oh, but Friday afternoon I promised this guy I'd spar with him at the gym.
Oh, shoot.
Hey, Alex, aren't you going to ask me?
Oh, sure, John.
Can you help me out Friday afternoon?
No, I have a class.
I just wanted to be asked, that's all.
Hey, maybe I could take him Friday morning if Tony could switch his sparring.
Great.
Maybe I could switch my date to Friday afternoon if you could switch your sparring Oh, how did I get myself into this here?
Hey, this must be Jason!
How are you, Jason?
Jason, this is Alex Rieger, Hi.
Bobby Wheeler, Kid, how are you doing?
John Burns.
Hi.
and Tony Banta.
Hi.
Alex, I really have to run.
Are you sure you can handle this?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
the guys said they'd volunteer.
Hey, listen, you just, uh, you just go ahead and, uh, make sure your aunt gets well.
Quick.
Aw, thanks, guys.
You're really the greatest.
: Ooh!
Mmm I'm gonna miss you.
Good luck on the spelling bee Saturday.
Okay, you be a good boy now.
Oh, I love you.
Bye-bye.
Thanks, guys.
Bye, Elaine.
Take care.
Yeah, Take it easy.
Well, I'll see you guys later.
I got to go.
Yeah, I got to run.
Nice meeting you, Jason.
Gee, 10:00 already.
Hey, Bob-Bobby, listen, uh, I got to get something from my locker.
Would you just stay here just a few minutes and talk to Jason, please?
What-what am I going to say to him?
I don't know.
You'll think of something to say.
Just for a few minutes.
I'll be right back.
Hey, listen, Jason, we'll go get some breakfast, okay?
Thanks.
So you're a kid, huh?
I try.
Mom told me you're an actor.
Uh yeah, yeah, yeah.
She says you're great.
Oh, yeah?
Can I ask you something?
Oh, sure.
Here, come on.
I'll put you up here.
Okay, shoot.
You know, I'm really scared about this spelling bee Saturday.
How do you keep from getting nervous when you have to stand up in front of all those people?
Everybody gets nervous in front of an audience.
Okay, Jason, let's go grab a bite, okay?
Hey, that's okay, Alex.
You've got things to do.
I'll take Jason out to breakfast.
Yeah?
That's nice of you, Bob.
Yeah, it is, isn't it?
Yeah.
I'll bring him over to your house when we're through, all right?
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
Take care of his books.
Bye.
What do you want to eat, kid?
Food.
Mmm Hey, Alex.
Yeah?
Kid gone yet?
Yeah.
Bobby just took him out.
Wh-Wh-What's wrong with you?
I don't know, I guess I just panicked.
I don't know what to do around a kid.
Do what you do when you were a kid.
You want me to punch him?
Let's go get some breakfast, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I hear you.
You say one of our drivers was rude to you.
What was it he said exactly?
I see.
And how fat are you?
Come on!
I'll get you.
Come here!
Oh, man, you were great today, man.
Hey, Louie, you should have seen him.
Two boxing lessons and he can already beat my brains out.
What took him so long?
Would you hold on a minute, please?
Burns is looking for you guys.
He's upstairs.
Oh, man, he must be mad 'cause we're late.
I'm gonna go get him.
Okay, thanks again for today, Tony.
That's all right.
Listen Yeah, don't you worry, really.
I'm gonna give that driver a severe reprimand.
We here at the Sunshine Cab Company expect all our cabbies to be kind and courteous to every passenger especially you blimpos.
Don't mention it.
That was a complaint.
That's one of the most difficult things about being a dispatcher-- handling these delicate situations with tact.
You know something, it's funny.
I don't dislike you as much as I do most kids.
Thank you.
I guess that's 'cause we've got something in common.
I was raised by my mother, too.
Tell me something, do do you smoke?
You drink?
Use foul language?
Yeah, it's really tough without a father to teach you.
Hey, John.
Huh?
I'm sorry we were so late, but I was having such fun that I forgot all about time.
Oh, that's okay, we have half an hour before the movie starts.
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna see?
Death on the Nile.
Hey, I saw it last week.
I sat through it three times.
It was that good, huh?
Nah, I just couldn't remember where I came in.
Hey, I figured we'd go to the movies.
How do you like that?
Yeah, sure.
The only thing is, I really haven't finished studying for my spelling bee yet.
Oh.
Well, that's okay.
We don't have to go to the movies.
Hey, what are you worried about?
I can tell you how it ends anyway.
Or was that the middle?
Anyhow, I guess I'd better call Suzanne.
She was gonna meet us afterwards.
Mm.
No, really, John.
Please, let's go to the movie.
I got plenty of time to study.
I'm almost through the whole dictionary.
I'm already up to the S's.
Okay!
We'll see you, Tony.
Hey, you two off somewhere?
Yeah, we're going to the movies.
Make sure it's a "G" rating.
Hey, look, John, will you get him back by 6:00?
I've got tickets to the Knicks game tonight.
All right!
Yeah, we'll be back.
Thanks, John.
See ya.
Okay, I'll see you guys.
Yeah, bye.
Bye, Mr. De Palma.
Oh.
Cute kid, isn't he?
Yeah.
Hey, incidentally, did you check with Harris on the day shift to see if he could take care of the kid tomorrow night?
Yeah, I talked to him.
He's busy.
There's no way I can get back on time.
I'd love to, but I've got to go to acting class tomorrow night.
I'm doing a scene.
So who we gonna get to take care of Jason?
Gee, I I I don't know.
I mean, that's a real problem.
There's got to be somebody around here that can do it.
Yeah, somebody.
I mean, it would only be for a couple of hours.
There must be somebody who could help us out.
Uh let's see look around Who's here?
I can't think of a soul.
Nobody I can think of.
Me either.
Hmm   I got it.
What?
Why don't we ask Louie?
Nah, I don't want Jason to catch his cold.
Yeah.
Alex, you home?
Yeah, I'm in here.
I'm just changing.
Louie and his mother took me to the wrestling matches.
Great fight.
Hey.
Hey, Louie, I didn't know you smoked cigars.
I don't as a rule, but Ma couldn't finish it, so So are you guys going someplace else?
Yeah, well, I thought we might go out and get some ice cream.
What do you say?
Whoo.
Gee, I don't know.
I really should do some studying for the spelling bee tomorrow.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Hey, listen, we've been keeping you so busy, you haven't had a chance to study.
You sure you're going to be all right for tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
I just need one good night's work and I'll be fine.
Well, I got to go.
Ma's in the car.
She didn't feel like coming in.
She's really self-conscious.
She spilled beer all over her dress.
That's her.
I got to go.
Hey, thanks again for tonight, Louie.
: I give, I give!
I got to get going.
I don't like to keep my mother waiting.
Keep your pants on, crazy lady!
See you.
Well, look, kid, I'll get out of your way.
Are you sure you're not too tired from all this running around, huh?
Not at all; the running around has been fun.
Now I feel like getting to work.
Okay.
Go get 'em, champ.
Right.
Oh, Jason, uh you feel ready?
You want to go over a few more words just to make sure?
Um, spell, um "Encyclopedia".
E-n-c-y-c-l-o-p-e-d-i-a.
Is that right?
Yeah.
Good, good.
You're ready.
Hey, look who's here.
Hey!
Hi!
Hey, Alex.
Excuse me.
You mean everybody came to watch me?
Looks that way.
Surprise!
We're all here!
And Suzanne sends her luck, too.
This is super!
Hey, Louie!
You came here for this?
Why shouldn't I come?
I happen to love spelling bees.
Look who's here.
How about this?
You got nothing to worry about.
I can tell just by looking at the rest of them, they're all losers.
Okay, pal.
May I have your attention, please?
Would the contestants please take their places onstage?
You show them how to spell, man.
All right!
Guys, sit down.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the district finals of the National Spelling Bee Contest.
Now, without any further delay, let me introduce the contestants.
Our first finalist, from PS 25 in the Bronx, is Miss Christa Fowler.
Uh, that's my daughter.
Hmm Well, she's a loser.
Hey.
Our second finalist, from PS 33 in New York, Master Jason Nardo.
my kid beats your kid.
I beg your pardon?
What's the matter?
A little wager on the side.
What do you say?
I do not bet on my child.
That's 'cause you know she's a loser.
Hey, Louie, will you get over here?
How about you?
You want to put a little money on it?
Louie!
Look, sit down.
And our fifth finalist, from PS 55 in Queens, is Marilou Hartman.
That concludes our introductions, so if the judges are ready, let the contest begin.
Please step to the microphone, our first contestant.
The word is "coagulate".
"Coagulate".
C-o-a-g-u-l-a-t-e.
Correct.
Contestant number two.
Okay, here we go.
The first round is always the toughest.
You ought to know, Banta.
It's the only one you ever fight in.
The word is "phosphorous".
"Phosphorous".
P-h-o-s-p-h-o-r-o-u-s.

Jason!
Jason!
Jason!
You'll have to excuse us.
We're a little excited.
Yeah we're his father.
Marilou, the word is "hypochondriac".
"Hypochondriac".
H-y-p-e-r-c-h-o-n-d-r-i-a-c.
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.
Audience: Oh Hmm.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're now down to our final two contestants.
Now, should either of them now miss a word, the other one will have to spell it correctly before he or she can be declared the winner.
Christa the word is "onomatopoeia".
"Onomatopoeia".
O-n-o-m-a-t-o-p-o-e-i-a.
Correct!
Lucky guess.
Louie, give her credit; she's good.
I know I hate her.
Jason, the word is "chlorophyll".
Ooh!
Is that with one "l" or two "l's"?
Probably.
"Chlorophyll".
C-h-l-o-r-o-p-h-y-l -l.
Correct.
That was close.
Christa The word is "sesquipedalian".
Why does she get all the easy ones?

Correct!
You are our new district champion!
Fix!
Fix!
Louie!
Louie!
Come on!
Come on!
Hey, you did your best.
That's the main thing, man.
Come on.
Hey, let me tell you.
Coming in second ain't the worst thing in the world.
Right.
Tony does it all the time.
Hey, Jason, you shouldn't feel bad about losing.
It wasn't your fault.
No?
Whose fault was it?
Ours.
I mean, how could he study?
He was so exhausted from all the boxing and the movies and the wrestling.
If anybody should feel bad right now, it ought to be us.
Hi, guys!
And her.
Hey, Elaine!
Hey, Elaine, how you doing?
Hi, Elaine.
Hey, how's your aunt?
She's much better.
Thanks.
Ooh, how's my boy?
How did you do in the spelling bee?
Not so well, Mom.
I lost.
Aw well.
I think you should know, Elaine, it wasn't his fault, it was our fault.
Yeah, that's right.
We were having such a good time with him that he never had a chance to study.
It was our fault, really.
That's nice of you guys to say, but I'm the one who blew it.
Studying was supposed to be my responsibility, not anybody else's.
It was nobody's fault but mine.
You know something?
If I had to choose between your winning or losing and saying what you just said I'd still take winning, but this was close.
Come on, your sister's in the car.
Let's go home.
Bye, J. Hey, go get 'em, Jason.
You did good, Jason.
You come back and visit us, all right?
You'll get it  Good-bye, Mr. De Palma.
See you, Jason.
Mm, thanks from me, too, guys.
You're the greatest.
No, we're not but I'll tell you one thing, Elaine.
That is some kid you got there, you know?
I know.
Bye-bye.
Thanks.
See you.
Later, Elaine.
Okay, I got something I was saving for a real occasion.
I'm going to share it with you guys.
This is an occasion?
Whenever Louie shares anything, it's an occasion.
I'll bet you've never tasted stuff like this before.
What's that?
You know, I never thought much about having kids before, but if I was gonna have one, I think that'd be the kid I want.
Yeah, Suzanne and I have talked about kids, but we decided to wait until we find out how.
I mean, how to raise them.
I mean, gee, you see how good Elaine did, you know.
It makes you think that you could, too.
It's kind of funny, you know, getting tied down with a wife and kids.
I must have spent half my life trying to avoid that, but, uh now I'm starting to wonder what I'm missing.
What have you got to worry about?
You're young.
You still got a chance.
I'm never gonna have a son.
Me Louie De Palma.
And I'd have made a great old man, too.
What are you talking about, Louie?
You could still have a kid.
Nah!
First you got to find a woman.
You got to fall in love get married talk to her.
Hmm.
It ain't worth it.
You know, you guys are just looking at the good stuff.
What about all the money it takes to raise a kid?
Not to mention the heartache and the worry that goes into it.
You worry from the day they're born and it never stops.
Are they eating enough?
Are they eating too much?
Are their teeth coming in straight?
You worry when they're sick.
You worry when they don't come home from school on time.
You worry about their grades.
You worry about whether they're they're running around with the right kids.
You worry if they're gonna meet the right girl, about a job I mean it never ends.
So what's it all for?
I mean, what's the best you get out of it?
Maybe a hug and a kiss every now and then because the kid feels like he has to.
All in all it's not a bad deal.
* Climb upon my knee, sonny boy * * You're only three * What's my name?
* Sonny boy.
What's there no way of?
* There's no way of knowing * What else is there no way of?
* There's no way of showing * What means who to who?
* Oh, what you mean to me * What's my name again?
* Sonny boy.
* Oh, when there are gray skies * Oh, I hate the gray skies, don't you?
* I don't mind the gray skies * How do you explain that?
* You make them blue * Would you believe it?
I forgot my name again.
* Sonny boy.
That's it.
* Friends may forsake me * It wouldn't surprise me a bit.
* Let them all forsake me * That's a rather cavalier attitude.
* I still have you, Sonny boy.
Good night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hey, you know, if we don't get out of here soon, we're gonna miss the first race.
Don't worry about it.
Hey, you hear anything from John yet?
What am I, an information booth?
I was just asking.
I mean, He should have been in by now.
He should have been in?
I should have been rich.
You should have had a better nose.
Life is cruel.
Hey, get away from that cage, Bobby.
We're not insured if he breaks out.
Okay, let's see, in the fifth.
Hey, if that's the gallery, tell them I'm on my way.
Oh, you guys are going to the track, huh?
Yes, we are.
Alex picked some big winners here.
Man, we're gonna clean up.
Yeah?
Ah, give me the aspirin!
That crumb!
He's worse than crabs.
That miserable little loaf.
Who?
Who's he talking about?
John.
You can go to the track without him.
That crumb had a wreck.
What?
How'd it happen?
Was it serious?
Is he hurt?
He's fine till I get my hands on him and my feet.
Hey, Louie!
The guy's had an accident.
Don't walk all over him.
He's probably in a lot of trouble right now himself.
He was driving 804.
Louie, are you sure?
I checked him out myself.
Where's the aspirin?
Man, that's impossible.
I just drove her yesterday.
I swear, I'm going to kill him.
Louie, I know you're upset.
We all are.
But you can't blame John.
Hey, we can't blame John, can we?
He never should have wrecked that cab.
Man, 804 another month, she would have set a record.
No cab ever went a half a million miles before.
Hey, Louie, what's the damage?
Won't know till we see her.
But once you get a tow hook in your fender, you're on short time.
With that donkey, figure the worst.
I can't believe it.
There'll never be another one like her.
You guys go on.
I'm going to stay here and see what happens Hey, I couldn't leave now.
I mean, we can go to the races anytime.
Hey, I ain't ashamed to say it.
I loved that cab.
We all loved it, Tony.
There'll never be another cab 804.
What a cab.
You put her into low, and you know what she'd do?
She'd go into low.
It's like she knew you trusted her.
Damn!
All the cabs we got here, why did he have to wreck 804?
You know what's ironic?
I first met John in cab 804.
I was cruising around Grand Central about 11:00.
Taxi!
Over here, taxi.
Hi.
It's okay.
I can manage.
That's good.
Would you like the address?
Huh?
Would you like the address?
Sure.
Why not?
Huh?
Hey, what's this thing?
Safety shield.
What do you need it for?
To protect me from muggers.
Oh  I should have known then.
Gee, that cab was like a good luck charm to me.
I was in 804 the night I got held up.
That was lucky?
I lived.
That was when all those robberies were going on, you know?
Remember when I started carrying that big gun around for protection?
Oh, uh sorry.
I forgot to lock that door.
You're going to have to sit in the back.
Or the front.
Whichever.
I just want your fare money, son.
No games.
Uh, I can't.
See, it's locked in a strongbox, and we don't have the keys.
Hey, don't play with me, man.
It's in the cigar box under the seat.
You've done this before.
The money.
Okay, drop it!
What?
You heard me.
I said drop it.
Drop it?
Yeah, drop it.
Come on, drop it.
I said drop it.
Now drop it.
No, man.
You drop yours.
I drew first.
My gun's bigger.
You should drop yours.
Man, just give me the money so I can go.
You give me your money.
See, man, you don't understand.
I do this for a living.
You don't understand.
You're not getting a dime from this cab.
Nobody really expects for you to defend yourself against this.
You know?
I mean, what you got, a lousy 50, 60 bucks?
It's just a Tuesday night take, man.
Use your head.
You're not getting the money.
And I ain't leaving here without it.
Yeah?
Well, it's your life, mister 'cause nobody holds me up.
Uh, what is it?
You get embarrassed if you got robbed?
Man, nowadays, everybody gets robbed.
I don't mean nothing personal.
I don't mean this as a putdown or nothing, man, but why you giving me such a hard time?
I mean, you can see my point, can't you?
Now I really believe that we could-- we can break through the racial barriers and come to a genuine understanding here, man.
You're not getting the money.
You pasty-faced, vanilla, lily-white towhead.
What time is it, man?
I'm not telling you.
There's probably a clock around here somewhere.
Wh-what's so funny?
You got a ticket.
While we were sitting here we fogged up the windows so much a cop came by, gave us a ticket and didn't even spot us.
Now, that's funny.
What a sensational night.
Why don't you give me the money?
You're not getting the money.
Oh.
Come on, man.
Tell me what time it is.
I bet it's 1:00.
Shank of the evening.
You don't even know what you doing.
Look at your hand.
It's all throbbing from holding that big gun.
You can't make it, man.
You at the end of the line.
Hey, you're just as tired as I am.
Huh, I sure am.
Okay, I got an idea.
Let's give each other a break and switch guns to the other hand.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Now, we switch on the count of three.
Yeah, but no funny stuff, man.
I'll count.
I'll come in if you get stuck.
Okay.
One two three!
Hey, man.
Hey, you did that on purpose.
You got my gun and I got yours.
Let's switch.
Uh-uh.
Why not?
Mine wasn't loaded.
Well, m-mine isn't either.
Oh, yes, it is, man.
I saw the cartridges.
Now come on, man, it's all over with now.
Come on, just give me the money.
Come on.
Hey, man, what the..
?
They're stuck.
Hey, man, you're nuts.
Aw, that's it, man.
Man, I you ain't no fun to stick up, man.
That's it.
I'm getting out of here.
Hey, not so fast.
You owe me 38 bucks.
For what?
The meter was running.
No, no, no You make it 48.
I forgot about the ticket.
Now, stop.
Now, I mean it.
'Cause I-I'll hit you.
Come on, come on.
Seven eight.
All right.
I hope you're satisfied now.
Hey, now I don't have enough for cab fare home.
What's your address?
You take me there?
No, I just want to tell the cops where you live.
Good night.
That's incredible, Bobby, the way you stood up to him.
Did he get arrested?
Oh, yeah.
I got a little commendation for it and a little piece in the paper nothing to write home about.
Well "Heroic Cabby Cracks Down On Crime".
Third page, 14 paragraphs, small photo.
I'd almost forgotten about it.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, I saved a guy's life once in 804.
No kidding?
Saved a guy's life?
How'd you do that?
You didn't save anybody's life.
Sure, I did.
You did not.
It was no big thing.
I mean, the guy whose life I saved he wasn't so hot.
Hey, you're not kidding are you?
Well, what happened?
See, well I picked this guy up by the train station around Queen's Plaza and Northern Boulevard.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Where to?
I don't know yet.
Just drive, okay?
Okay.
So, I'm tooling around Queens for about 20 minutes and the next thing I know, I'm on the 59th Street Bridge.
Excuse me, would you stop here, please?
What are you, crazy?
This is a bridge.
I know.
I'm going to jump off and kill myself.
Hey, don't do that!
Okay.
Thanks.
It's okay.
That's all there was to it?
Yeah.
He has the nerve to compare that story with mine.
At least I didn't take an hour to tell it.
Oh, it's a lousy story.
It is not.
Hey, you guys, will you knock it off.
It's not important.
It doesn't matter whose story is better.
What matters is, they both happened in 804.
I got a great story.
Oh, come on Louie, not now will ya?
I had a guy in this cab once when I was hacking-- a real shrewdie, you know what I mean?
I mean, this guy was one tough cookie.
Get over!
Get over, you bum you!
Piece of dirt.
Taxi!
All right, get in.
Driver, I want you to take him to the Walden School, this address.
Now, here's your luggage, and don't lose it.
And don't sell it.
Yeah, yeah.
Here you go.
$20 ought to cover it.
All right, now, remember: this $600 is for food, books, and necessities.
It's not for gambling.
It's not for pornography.
It's not to purchase weapons.
Yeah, yeah.
You a father?
I don't think so.
Don't be.
All right, we'll see you for Thanksgiving.
And I'll tell your mother you're sorry you made her cry.
Yeah, yeah.
This is De Palma in 804.
Taking a fare to the Walden School Central Park West.
Bully for you, De Palma.
Two fares in five hours.
A good day.
Yeah, yeah.
Who's he?
My dispatcher.
All dispatchers are scum.
Remember that.
Hey, I'll give you another What, do you think I'm crazy?
You'd kill somebody.
I'd lose my license.
Okay.
Fork it over.
Get in there.
I don't need this pillow.
You sure you know how to do this?
You don't steal cars without knowing how to drive them.
Keep it over.
Who's driving, you or me?
Nice jacket you're wearing.
It ought to be.
It's tailor-made.
Really?
My whole outfit cost me 75.
That includes 65 for the transistor radio.
What's it like being rich?
What's it like being poor?
Don't be a wise guy.
I asked you a real question, trying to make polite conversation.
What's your mother look like?
Like that.
Ooh very nice.
You don't mind if I say your mother's a very attractive woman?
Very nice bagonzas, if you know what I mean.
What are bagonzas?
How old are you?
Bagonzas are feet.
Red light.
Do you really have $600 in here?
Yeah.
Hey, you want to make a bet?
What sort of bet?
Green.
I don't know.
All right.
I bet you I can say all 50 states in less than a minute.
All 50 states in less than a minute?
Yeah.
How much?
A hundred.
I can't bet a hundred bucks with a kid.
A rich kid?
Good point.
You're on.
Let me see your hundred first.
All right.
I'll bet you you can't say all 50 states in less than a minute.
And I'll time you.
I'll tell you when to go.
All right go.
All 50 states.
I can't believe you fell for that old trick.
Man, what a stiff.
I can't believe it either.
Hey, you want a chance to get even?
I don't know.
What's the bet?
All right.
I'll bet you another hundred that I can tell you the score between tonight's game between the Knicks and the Celtics before it starts.
Hmm You're going to bet me that you can tell me the actual score of the game that's going to be played tonight between the New York Knickerbockers and the Boston Celtics?
You can tell me that score before it starts?
Yeah.
You're on.
Zero-zero.
Boy, I wish this was a longer trip.
But, unfortunately, we're here.
Hey, you want another chance to get even?
No, thanks.
No more tricks.
No, no, this isn't a trick.
It's a simple contest between two men.
We'll see who can hold their breath the longest.
No tricks, huh?
Strictly on the level.
You sure?
I'm sure.
For how much?
The whole 800.
Do you smoke?
Camels, unfiltered.
You're on.
Four, five, six, seven, eight.
All right.
I'll say "One, two, three" and then we'll start.
All right?
One two three Go.
Hey, you okay?
!
You breathed!
Hey, come on, don't cry.
That money was supposed to last me all year.
Now I don't know what I'm going to do.
Aw, come, come here aw, there, there, aw easy easy.
You're not such a bad little tyke after all.
Losing this money really puts you in a spot, doesn't it?
It sure does.
Okay, okay.
There, there, there.
All right, all right.
I'll tell you what.
Have you learned your lesson?
You bet I have.
Well, then here.
Here's $20.
You take $600 from a child?
You call that a great story?
He was a monster.
And I don't care if it was an old lady's life savings.
is a great story.
Hey, maybe we're all getting upset for nothing.
I mean, we don't know for sure that 804 is totaled.
Maybe it was just a fender bender.
Hi, everybody.
I'm fine.
Hey, everything's all right.
I'm fine.
Next week, more memories of Cab 804.
Stop the cab!
What for?
We've skipped phase two.
We're too late.
We're too late?
Oh, my gosh, she's having the baby.
She's still contracting.
This is it, this is the baby.

So, would you spend the night with me tonight?
What about her?
You'll have to take over.
Me?

Mm-hmm.
I quit.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
A much too fast recap of last week's Taxi.
Louie got this phone call.
John had wrecked cab 804.
I was in 804 the night I got held up.
Remember when I started carrying that big gun around for protection?
Just want the fare money, son.
No games.
Okay, drop it!
Drop it?
Hey, man.
You ain't no fun to stick up, man.
Hey, I saved a guy's life once in 804.
Hey, don't do that!
Okay.
Hey, maybe we're all getting upset for nothing.
I mean, we don't know for sure that 804 is totaled.
Hi, everybody.
Hey, everything's all right.
I'm fine.
Just look at that grillwork.
I can't look at her anymore.
Well, we'll know soon enough.
under the wrench.
It's going to take a miracle to save her.
I wish it was me that was going under the wrench.
Oh, John Come on.
Don't feel so bad.
It was just an accident.
It could happen to any of us.
Right?
Either of us.
Latka!
Latka!
How you doing?
We're counting on you, Latka.
Take as much time as you need.
As much time as you need, right?
We know you can do it, buddy.
I still say we should have got a specialist.
No, Latka'll do fine.
He's our man.
Hey, if he can't fix it, nobody can.
Wait till he sees the cab.
Eh, trust.
No need for specialist.
I can fix it.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I quit.
Latka, no!
Come on.
You got to go get 'em, boy.
Yeah, Latka, do your best.
Please, Latka, please!
Save her, will you, please?
Genius!
Hey, let's forget about this.
I mean, I feel just as bad as any of you but standing around like this isn't going to help.
You want to hear a story about what happened to me in 804?
Yeah.
Well, it's just about this guy I picked up one night What's wrong?
I thought when it came to passengers, you never, uh No, I don't.
Well well, I mean, you got to understand.
I mean, this was special.
You know, there are just certain things in life that a girl can't resist.
Like what?
Well, like an auction.
I mean, I hear about an auction and I go crazy, you know?
Or a ride in the country.
I mean, I love a ride in the country.
Oh, and nice manners.
I adore nice manners.
Elaine, what's this got to do with the guy you picked up?
Well  Excuse me, I've got to get to a private auction in the country.
Is it possible for you to take me?
I know it's a lot to ask.
I get off duty in half an hour.
How far is it?
Oh, I don't know.
140 I can make it.
Uh, this is cab 804.
I'm going to be a little late.
I have an out-of-town fare.
Good.
How late will you be?
Don't wait up.
Elaine Nardo, huh?
It's a good picture.
Come on.
It's a terrible picture.
My hair wasn't fixed and my eyes are half-closed It's a mug shot.
Listen, maybe everybody asks you this, but how come you're driving a cab?
There was this fat lady once.
Four suitcases and three kids.
I drove her all the way to New Jersey.
The kids were hanging out the windows, and she was screaming at the kids to get back inside.
Two of the kids even got sick in the car.
I don't get it.
She's the only one who never asked me why I drive a cab.
Okay.
You don't have to tell me.
I only tell special people.
The reason I drive a cab is because I'm divorced and I need the extra money.
I really work as a receptionist at an art gallery.
That gallery is what I really care about.
Uh, listen, the auction that I'm going to is an art auction.
Would you like to join me?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that as a come-on.
No, that's not true.
I did mean that as a come-on.
Would you?
Oh, I don't know.
I I couldn't date a guy that I didn't know.
What's your name anyway?
Mike Beldon.
Certainly good to know you, Mike Beldon.
Mike Beldon, Mike Beldon.
I own a few paintings myself, but mostly I just buy for other people.
I'm still at the renting stage.
I get them from libraries, you know.
Just having them around the house, you know, changes the whole atmosphere for me.
This isn't like me.
What isn't?
I'm still not comfortable about having a passenger ride up front.
Passenger?
I thought we were friends.
We shouldn't be doing this.
Why not?
What are you afraid of?
You know what I mean.
It's like, you know, here we are, sharing the same experiences, the same interests  Sort of maybe feeling a little attracted to each other?
Maybe a little.
Maybe a lot?
Maybe a lot.
Good.
But it's too perfect, you know?
Yeah, we should stop.
Something's going to go wrong.
What are you talking about?
I mean, like, I just know it's going to turn out you're either married, gay, or crazy.
I hit it, didn't I?
You're one of those?
Married, gay, or crazy?
Yeah, you're right.
Come on, crazy.
Right again.
Thank God.
So we got divorced.
I wanted kids, she didn't.
Simple as that.
I don't know.
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe I'm just too old-fashioned, but, uh I still believe in families.
How about you?
What is it, a tattoo somewhere that says, "I have kids"?
You knew that.
See?
You are too perfect.
Why are we stopping?
We're here.
Oh, you're kidding.
that fast, huh?
Listen There's something I got to ask you.
Great.
It would seem real strange if I had to say good-bye to you right now.
So, would you spend the night with me tonight?
Believe me, I I wouldn't rush it like this, but I don't think I'm going to get another chance.
So, would you spend the night with me?
You mean all night?
I'm not being naive.
I just want to make sure that I understand you.
All night.
You mean in the same room?
Not naive.
I'm just checking.
Same room.
Do you mean just for tonight?
I have to fly to London in the morning.
What about when you come back?
I don't know when I'm coming back, and I'd hate to make a promise I couldn't keep.
You're not so perfect.
You don't even know when to lie.
What about tonight?
I can't Unless there's even the slightest chance that you might not go to London tomorrow.
Okay, there's a slight chance.
Yeah?
No, that's a lie.
Now, see, you happy?
I'm a liar.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, I am really sorry.
I'm furious at myself is what I am.
I understand.
So long.
A kiss we can do.
What was that question again?
Oh, you're sure going to get remembered, fella.
Uh, hey listen, I owe you some money here.
That's right.
Thanks.
Here, take this.
A hundred dollars?
No, please take it.
Oh, wait, I can't!
Please?
I'd feel like a call girl.
You didn't do anything.
I'd feel like a bad call girl.
I want you to have it.
I mean, think of it as a down payment on your art gallery.
You deserve it.
It's the best cab ride I ever had.
Oh.
Oh, this is some tip.
What would you have given me if I'd stayed the night?
A very sweet memory.
You're better off with the hundred.
Louie!
Oh, Louie..
!
Oh, I don't believe it!
Louie, what are you doing?
!
I don't believe it!
Louie, you creep!
You know, this creep has nothing to do than to interfere with other people's lives.
I hate you!
Oh, I am so embarrassed.
I am so sorry.
I had no idea.
I'll kill you!
I'm sorry.
I believe you.
Good night.
Oh, good night.
Good old 804.
Well, he sounds like he was some kind of great guy.
No, you did the right thing.
The guy had to have a big flaw somewhere.
He did.
He took no for an answer.
It's your turn.
What, for a story?
Oh, come on.
I don't have any good ones.
I mean, it's just the usual stuff, you know.
Well, one time I had this contortionist who insisted on riding in the trunk.
I had a woman one time with a head of lettuce she said was alive, and she wanted me to ask it questions.
I mean, you know, usual stuff.
Nothing unusual, huh?
Well, there was this one time in 804, but it was no big deal, actually.
I'll bet you this guy's got the best story of them all.
You bet.
It helps to get it off your chest.
Right.
It goes like this.
Well, it was a miserable night.
It had just been snowing, and my bookings were real light, when I see this guy Taxi!
Hi there.
Methodist Hospital.
It's not an emergency, or anything, is it?
No.
We're having a baby, but no need to panic.
Everything's cool.
Who's we?
Just a minute.
Don't start the meter.
You okay?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Okay.
You were right behind me on the stairs.
What happened?
What happened?
I lost you when you started taking two at a time.
Hello.
You can start the meter now.
Don't drive too fast.
We got plenty of time.
Are you sure?
Yeah, we're going natural.
We've had the Lamaze classes.
We know exactly what we're doing.
Going natural is so great because ou know ahead of time what's going to happen.
You don't have to worry anyway.
With my pelvis, the doctor says I'm gonna drop 'em like kittens.
My mother was like that.
Even my grandmother dropped 'em like kittens.
My great-grandmother Dropped 'em like kittens?
That's enough.
She may be a little nervous.
It's okay, that's why I'm here to keep her calm.
I made you a great peanut butter Oh, oh.
Here comes another one.
Start timing.
Huh?
Start timing her labor contractions.
The length of the contraction and how often they occur lets you know exactly which stage of the labor she's in.
She's just in the latter part of the first phase of the first stage because the contractions are way, way apart, lasting about 20 seconds.
Later on they'll maybe They'll be maybe three minutes or so apart and last about 60 seconds.
Ultimately, the last couple of minutes will be one right after the other.
That's the third and final phase of the first stage.
It's pretty fascinating, isn't it?
Yeah, I guess so.
I'm her coach.
I give all the directions.
It keeps her mind focused away from the pain that way.
Coach, huh?
Yeah, that's the name they give us.
I've got the sack here, bag.
I've got a rolling pin and tennis ball for back pain in case she needs a back rub.
I got some candy in case I get hungry.
I do the breathing too right along with her.
We share everything.
This way she doesn't feel like she's having the baby alone.
Hey, listen, why don't you relax?
Sit back there and have some candy.
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm not hungry.
Maybe when I get to the Stop.
Me?
She means me.
I stop timing the contraction.
It's over now.
I check to see how long it lasted-- minute and ten seconds-- make a note of it.
Pencil, pencil may I?
Oh, sure.
Here.
Huh?
Oh, thanks.
A minute and ten seconds?
In phase one?
Here comes another one.
You just had one.
Well, I'm having another one.
That's phase three.
What happened to phase two?
Stop.
I can't.
Not you, him!
Stop the cab!
What for?
We skipped phase two, we're too late.
We're too late?
Oh, my gosh.
She's having the baby right here.
She's still contracting.
This is it, this is the baby.
Hey, hey, listen, I thought you were supposed to stay calm?
I thought we were supposed to have three phases, and look, she's still contracting.
This is it, this is the baby.
All right, now, try to stay calm now.
You want me to get a doctor?
No, don't talk to me, I feel sick.
What?
!
Faint.
I feel faint.
Do your breathing.
I can't.
I feel nauseous.
Help him, please!
Get him in the front seat.
Well, what about you?
!
I'm sorry, I feel I got to get air.
Here comes another one.
Keep Breathe, breathe.
Where did he go?
Hey, mister!
Please, lady, look give me a break.
Hey, what about her?
You'll have to take over.
Me?
!
Listen, no sweat.
I can coach you from here on how to coach her back there.
Hey, come on!
No kidding around.
You've got to go through with this.
Hey, come on, come on.
Shape up, fella, will you?
This happens to some men.
Please don't blame him for it.
Don't make him feel inferior.
Listen, lady, I'm a stranger.
You don't want me.
You want him.
She was the star pupil in her class.
She'll take coaching from anybody.
Hey, where are you going?
!
Come here!
What are you doing?
Here, watch me-- like this.
Coach her, coach her, don't let her coach you.
He's right, he's right.
Don't worry about how I am.
Make sure she follows you.
Make sure she follows you.
You're the boss, remember.
Have you got something to catch the baby?
Huh?
Use your coat.
Make sure she's relaxed.
Don't let her muscles tense up.
Hold her hand.
You can't hold my hand, I need my hand.
I can't hold her hand, she needs her hand.
Forget her hand.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Getting into position.
It's coming.
I can feel it.
Make sure she's at a 45-degree angle.
To what?
!
To what?
!
Are you pushing yet?
I didn't know I was supposed to push.
I'm not talking to you.
Oh.
Push.
Are you pushing?
: I'm pushing!
What's he doing?
He's doing fine.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Isn't she concentrating?
How should I know?
Why don't you call a doctor.
Use the radio, will you?
Are you all right?
All right, I got it.
Here, you talk.
Oh, my God.
Louie!
Alex.
Cab 804.
Listen, you got trouble here.
A lady's having a baby.
I never saw her before.
No, Louie, Louie!
Louie!
We're on 61st Street between Second and Third Avenues.
Get a doctor quick, will you, please?
It's coming.
Oh, my God.
Keep breathing!
Keep pushing!
Push.
You'll be all right.
You'll be all right.
Just take it easy.
Just relax.
Allen, watch.
It's coming.
I can feel it.
I can't.
Huh?
Allen!
Look!
I can't look.
I'm going to remember this.
You let a stranger deliver our baby.
I'll never marry you now.
Ruth, don't Ruth, please, don't be mad.
I can't help it.
Yeah, come on, Ruth, this is no time to argue.
Marry him if he wants to marry you.
Marry a man who won't even look at our baby?
All right, all right.
I'll look.
But what if I pass out?
Oh, God.
Look at that.
Now, take it easy.
I got it.
Watch the shoulders, now.
Careful.
Ruth, it's so beautiful.
Easy now.
Easy.
You're almost home free.
Ruth, it's a boy.
It's a boy.
Yeah.
A boy.
Wrap him up.
Don't cut the umbilical cord.
Lay him on top of Ruth.
He'll stay warm there.
Allen, look.
Hey I'm a father.
Ruth, I love you.
I love you too.
Hey, Congratulations.
Hey, Mister, really I don't know how to thank you for all this.
Aw We don't have a name for him yet.
What's your name?
Alex.
Maybe we'll just get you a bottle of scotch.
Hi.
Hey, Bob, what's happening?
Any word on 804 yet?
They took it upstairs.
They're still going to work on it.
Well Latka!
Just tell me.
How's it going?
Yeah, how's the car, man?
Ladies and gentlemen, I now present to you cab 804.
Latka!
The man's a genius, a genius.
Thank you very much.
Hey, can I be the first to drive it?
Hey, wait a minute!
I want to be the first to drive it.
I saved a guy's life in this car.
Hey, I saved my own life in this car!
I met my dream man in this car.
Now, hold it, hold it.
Now just hold it!
I know you all have good reasons to want this car, but I think I got you all beat.
I brought a beautiful human being into the world in this cab.
When a man is right, a man is right.
Well, thank you, Louie.
Thanks.
Oh, Alex?
Yes, Latka?
One thing-- Be careful of steering.
You know, sometimes you turn go this way when the car, it go this way.
Okay.
Oh, and also Yes?
Brakes are really good now except when it's wet or very dry.
Leave it to me.
Okay.
Oh, and one also, Alex.
Be sure don't go over because if you do, transmission Don't worry about it, Latka.
Okay.
See you later.
Okay.
See you, Alex.
Hey, Alex!
It's burning!
Turn it off!
Alex!
On reflection, I think I delivered that baby in 803.
Hey, guys.
I think I made a mistake.
It wasn't this cab at all.
Night, Mr. Walters.
