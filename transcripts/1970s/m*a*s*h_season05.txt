{START OF EPISODE 1}
Who's that on shovel number three?
- Salkowitz.
- Nice style.
He's a magician with latrines and cesspools.
Salkowitz!
A little deeper on that end.
That's where Major Burns sits.
Burns is so full of enthusiasm.
- Well, how's the new latrine coming?
- Another Taj Mahal.
- You gonna be here for the opening?
- I've never missed one.
I bless all new construction.
- There's a blessing for a new latrine?
- I'll wing it.
-  - The war's louder today.
- I asked them to hold it down.
- Try banging on the pipes.
You know, this is my first latrine digging.
Really?
You ought to come downtown more often.
This won't hurt a bit.
## - Sewing?
- Yeah, I lost a button off my pants.
- You devil.
- Oh, hey, your cigars came.
- Oh, El Redondos.
- Are they good?
Havana cigars made in Newark by Puerto Ricans.
- Wow.
Expensive?
- Eight bucks a box, and limited.
I get one box a year.
The rest goes to Milton Berle Nelson Rockefeller and Bishop Sheen.
Ahh, the aroma of gracious living.
Smell it?
Yeah, I'd like to.
I never been to New Jersey.
Sniff it like an excellent dollar bottle of wine.
A good cigar is like a beautiful chick with a great body who also knows the American League box scores.
- On the floor?
- It's strong enough to walk away by itself.
- When you gonna light it?
- Oh, that's about right.
-  - 4077 MASH.
Corporal O'Reilly Hey, Sparky.
How you doing?
How's things down at H.Q.?
- You got a U.S.O. Show, huh?
- Bob Hope and broads?
- Dobritch's dogs.
- Just our luck.
-  -  They coming up here?
I won't tell anybody.
Honest.
Go ahead.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Oh, no, I won't tell anybody, Sparky.
- Okay, I'll be talking to ya.
- What can't you tell anybody?
We're having a practice bug-out.
Moving ten miles down the road.
- You mean tear down all the tents and move?
- Klinger, don't tell anybody.
- My lips are sealed.
- Whew!
This foul air.
I'm glad we're diggin' a new latrine.
Major Burns.
Don't say anything.
- Don't tell me not to say anything.
- I haven't said it yet.
- What is it, Klinger?
- It's a secret.
- Well, then spit it out.
- We're due for a bug-out.
Retreating?
How dare you spread rumors we're retreating, rumormonger!
- Would I "mong" you?
- It's treason.
Anybody who would say America would retreat is not army.
Who says I'm army?
I'm delicatessen.
And don't ever spread rumors again.
Tittle-tattle will lose the battle.
A slip of the lip can sink a ship.
He's brighter than I thought.
- We know something you don't know.
- Major Houlihan is a brunette?
- Garbage head.
- Takes one to know one.
- May I join the conversation?
- Keep it short.
- Hi.
- That's short.
Guess what's happening.
- Santa Claus is coming to town.
- He is not!
- And we spent all that money on tinsel.
- We're bugging out.
Retreating.
A battalion of North Koreans is headed this way.
Frank, is this something you've been dreaming, or has the major been talking in her sleep?
Another garbage head.
- Two garbage heads are better than one.
- When are we supposed to bug out?
Any minute.
It's top secret.
We don't want enlisted personnel to know we're retreating.
Why, aren't they invited?
##  Oh.
Howdy, Padre.
Take it easy.
Water's cold as a witch's thorax.
- Well, I feel a lot better.
- You haven't even turned on the water.
No, but you're in such a good mood, it just can't be true.
- What can't be true?
- That we're bugging out.
Bugging out?
What are you talking about?
As I understand it, an entire battalion of Chinese paratroopers - is supposed to drop in on us within a few hours.
- Horse hockey!
Excuse me.
It's just another rumor.
Like last week, the Radio City Rockettes were supposed to play here.
What did we get?
An Italian sissy who played "Valencia" with his armpit.
##  ##  ##  - Incoming wounded, sir.
- Get my pants.
- Underwear?
- I'll fake it.
- Yes, sir.
- Wounded come before personal chafing.
- What's the story?
- Where have you been?
- I was putting on some toilet water, and the seat fell down.
- You wiseacre.
Well, you want me to smell nice, don't you?
- Alice!
Alice!
- Let me go!
Let me go!
Give him a break, Alice.
You're the first woman he's seen in months.
- B.J. - Yeah, Colonel?
- Take this hip.
- Right.
- Where you from, soldier?
- Connecticut.
Connecticut.
Two N's.
Got it right in a spelling bee once.
Won a wax pistol full of grape juice.
Colonel.
The guy back there.
Hell's bells.
Pierce.
Yo.
- What is it, Colonel?
- Shot in the back.
Can't move his legs.
Spinal cord injury.
Can we get a neurosurgeon from the 8063rd?
- No chance.
- He needs a laminectomy.
- You've just changed specialities.
- You always give me the cuties.
Well, I sure as hell ain't gonna give this one to Alice.
Looks like shrapnel in the spinal canal.
If I go in, we won't be able to move that kid for 24 hours.
Those bone fragments could lacerate the cord.
- So?
- The bug-out.
- Chinese paratroopers and tanks coming, four divisions.
- Crock of beans!
- You called me, Colonel?
- No.
- You called me, Colonel?
- No.
I'm gonna scotch this one once and for all.
I'll call General Hamilton at "l" Corps.
- He's a big shot.
- He owes me.
I sent him a case of Preparation H. Anything for the rear echelon.
That's right.
General Hamilton.
Colonel Potter calling.
- Get him, Radar?
- He's coming, sir.
- He was watching them wash his jeep.
- Spit and polish.
General Hamilton?
Yes, one minute for Colonel Potter, sir.
He's coming to the phone now.
Binky?
Sherm.
Oh, the missus is just fine.
She's stateside playing bingo with the Catholics.
Last month she won some talcum powder and a carton of Wings.
How's Marie?
Uh-huh.
You just tell her to soak that thing every night in warm boric acid solution.
In the meantime, one earring doesn't look bad on a woman her age.
Bink, level with me.
We've got some scuttlebutt goin' around.
Give it to me straight.
Are we supposed to bug out?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
That's straight, Bink?
Emmis?
We're stayin' put?
Good.
That's all I wanted to know.
What?
Oh, you're welcome.
There's plenty more where that came from.
Just don't sit on anything cold.
Well, thanks, Bink.
You too, General.
- Radar!
- There's no bug-out.
- I'll tell Hawkeye to start.
- We're not bugging out.
Go down to pre-op and tell Hawkeye to get started on that back surgery.
Moving, on the double.
- Is he under?
-  In the bosom of Abraham.
Let's hope Abe washed his hands.
- Why didn't you put the X ray where I can see it?
-  I'm sorry, Doctor.
Got it.
Yeah, what a business.
And I could have worked in Uncle John's car lot.
Fifty bucks a week and all the Studebakers you could eat.
- Osteotomes.
- Ready, Doctor.
-  - Give him some more juice.
This is why you get big money.
- I thought I'd given him enough.
- Don't think.
Be sure.
I'm sorry.
All right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Let's go in.
Retractors.
- Ready, Doctor.
- Whole blood?
- Plenty.
- Okay, you guys.
Time to beat your feet on the Mississippi mud.
Attention!
At ease, smart "aleckos".
This latrine was supposed to be dug last night.
- Why, sir?
We're buggin' out.
- Colonel Potter called General Hamilton.
We are not going to bug out.
So get busy.
I'd like to start the holidays with a fresh latrine.
- I want it a foot deeper over here.
- Your end, sir?
Never mind my end.
Dig!
Your lunch, sir.
And Cho Man Chin is outside.
Cold Spam on dry bread?
- The kitchen's all packed up for the bug-out, sir.
- Bug-out, my butt.
And tell Cho Man Chin I'm not interested in aluminum siding.
- I thought you were outside.
- Was outside.
Now inside.
Sir, should I bodily remove him?
He'd bite your neck and give you the gleet.
Colonel go for laugh.
No get.
Tell the mess sergeant to get that kitchen back in order.
We're not bugging out.
- He'll punch my arm.
- Wear your heavy sweater.
So, what are you selling, Cho?
Wristwatches that run backwards?
- Sold out.
- By the way, those wild boar's tusks turned out to be plastic.
Oh, during wartime you can't even trust animals.
- Get to it.
What's the poop?
- Real estate.
First-class poop.
- Real estate.
Next, you'll sell me your mother.
- Sold out.
You need property 'cause you moving.
- We're not moving.
- Word out, boss.
You moving.
I've talked to General Hamilton at Headquarters.
We no move.
We no move My God.
Now I'm talking like you.
Here you are, sir.
- Seems to me I've seen that Spam before.
- But it's warm now.
- Got the stove set up?
- Kept it under my arm.
Pass.
Maybe I should go over to Rosie's Bar and Grill.
They have a hot rice dish.
- What's it called?
- Hot rice.
Look here, Colonel.
Section 24.
Ten acres with view of drainage ditch.
This is the army.
We don't buy land.
If we want it, we take it.
Highway frontage, yet privacy.
Two trees, one green and one brown.
- No!
- You a real challenge.
- Sir, what about the hot rice?
- I lost my appetite.
- Throw in Rolaids.
- Colonel, sir, I'd like to report malingering.
- Now what?
- Men won't dig the latrine 'cause they think we're bugging out.
- That tears it!
Radar, sound assembly.
- I'll sound assembly.
- You gonna need that land.
- Hey, you.
That watch you sold me runs backwards.
Try other wrist.
##  Company!
Ten-hut!
I can't stand that pimply voice.
- At ease!
You people -  - I'll get the phone.
- Get the phone, Radar.
You people have been panicking over a rumor which says that the 4077 th is bugging out.
That is grade-A, You service people should know by now that scuttlebutt is as common as cooties in your Skivvies.
My apologies to those among us of the feminine gland and to our resident celibate - Father Mulcahy.
- Thank you, sir.
My pleasure.
Now, you take World War II.
My unit got the word that Nazis dressed as Eskimos had overrun Seattle.
Incredible as it seems, half my unit believed it and began hoarding canned salmon.
Now then, I have spoken personally to General Hamilton at Headquarters.
I've known Bink Hamilton for going on 30 years.
I am the godfather of his grandson, Sherman Potter Hamilton.
Fifteen years old and can name Already has an appointment to West Point.
The general has assured me there is nothing to worry about.
MASH 4077 is definitely bugging out in three hours!
Bug out!
Wait a minute!
Uh Company, dismissed!
-  What do we got?
- Multiple fractures dural laceration and a hematoma.
Never doubt your X ray or your hairdresser.
-  Hawkeye!
-  Mask!
-  We're bugging out in three hours.
- Oh, my God.
We can't stop now.
If the worst can happen, it will.
Pierce's theory of medicine.
Everybody's supposed to start packing.
Too bad this kid didn't come with a zipper.
- Clamp.
- Clamp.
Kelsey, save those tent stakes.
We'll need 'em later.
- You sent for me, sir?
- Where you been?
- When you sent for me, I thought you were kidding, sir.
- I don't kid, skeezix.
- I called you to put you in charge of this bug-out.
- Me?
- No choice.
You're second in command.
- Hot diggity dog!
I'm goin' up in the chopper to scout a new location.
- You ever bugged out before?
- Oh, no, sir.
Not intentionally.
- Is this a drill, Colonel?
- No, it's the real McCoy.
Keep an eye on the patients.
Sometimes we lose 'em on these moves.
A human life is more important than a kitchen stove.
Don't recite.
Listen.
Load in this order.
One, pharmacy; two, lab; three, X ray; four, pre-op; five, O.R., following the last stitch.
- Six, H.Q. ; seven, Mess Tent; eight, post-op.
- One, pharmacy - Saddle up!
- Yes, sir.
-  - Golly.
The enemy really is coming.
- They ain't playing mah-jongg.
Get with it, Burns.
- Yes, sir.
Kelsey, forget those tent stakes.
We'll make new ones!
Why didn't I shoot my foot and stay in Honolulu?
-  More suction.
-  Yeah, right.
-  Oozing?
-  Yeah, quite a bit.
Margaret, retract that some more and get the field dry.
Blood pressure's 90 over 60.
-  When it gets to a hundred, sell.
-  - More blood.
-  Right.
-  Can't they wait?
-  Looks like the army forgot to pay the rent.
Tell 'em the check's in the mail.
-  Sounds like the check just bounced.
- Sounds like it blew up.
Why does the war have to be so noisy?
That's so you can find it when the lights go out.
If I get slivers, I'll have your stripes.
- I'm a private.
- Don't pull rank on me!
##  Bring it back.
Straight back, straight back, straight back, straight back.
Left turn, left turn.
Let's get that first table up in there.
Guys, grab a hold of this table and get Hey!
Hey!
Can't you idiots watch where you're going?
- Major Burns?
- What?
That's not open for business.
Well, we've relieved the pressure.
There's nothing more we can do.
-  Will we be able to transfer him out of here?
- No, not for a while.
- There's too much risk of paralysis.
-   The Chinese are knocking at the door.
I don't care who it is.
He can't have visitors.
##  This tent should have been collapsed half an hour ago.
- Just getting my gear ready for the truck, sir.
- You call this gear?
Please, sir!
My brocade.
It's from the Spiegel catalog.
I always say, "Buy American".
- It's from Chicago.
- Oh, sure, like Polish ham.
These are not official gear, and they'll not be transported on a vehicle of the United States army.
I will never give up the Klinger collection.
- Come on, Pokey.
Keep up now.
-  - Cease!
- Whoa.
It's okay, Snuffy.
It's just Major Burns.
- Where you going with these rodents?
- Just gonna put 'em on the truck.
- Negative.
- Don't get upset.
Just eat your carrot slowly.
Nonexperimental rodents are neither military nor medical and they will not be transported on a government vehicle.
- These are my friends, sir.
- Soldier, there are no friends in wartime.
- How are they supposed to get to the new MASH?
- The guinea pigs can walk.
The rabbit can hop.
And the goat can do whatever it is goats do.
Major Burns, haven't you ever had a pet of your own?
Just a canary.
Never sang a note.
And it bit me.
Maybe you didn't talk to it right.
Are you telling a doctor how to talk to a bird?
I can't leave 'em here.
They might get killed!
If you start to cry, I'll give you a good slap.
Breakfast of champions.
Hawk, I'm staying here with you.
But don't get me wrong.
No, no, no.
You gotta go ahead and set up the new O.R. I gotta stay and watch the kid.
While you're at it, watch yourself.
This place is gonna be under new management.
Well, somebody's gotta hand over the key.
Clap hands.
Here comes Charlie.
Nice talking to you, Frank.
- What do you think you're doing, Hunnicutt?
- Your nostrils are flaring.
They have a right to flare.
I'm in charge.
That disgusting still is not coming to the new location.
It's not military equipment.
It's all military equipment.
The heating coil is from an ammo truck.
The funnel is from the generator shed.
And the filter's made with shredded Skivvies.
Alkie.
You'd tear up your underwear for a drink.
I would not.
They're yours.
As a unit, that still is nonmilitary and will not be transported by a vehicle.
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about your junk, Frank?
- Let's see what you're taking.
- Hands off!
- Frank!
- It's a gift for a fellow officer.
- It's not Colonel Potter's size.
- You know who it's for, snip.
- Military?
A hari-kari dagger?
- It's brand new.
Never been used.
Do us a favor, Frank.
Break it in.
- Where are we?
- Due west of Chin Chon.
This is no good.
No access road.
Go west toward Chuk San.
I'm starvin'.
I'd even settle for one of Radar's armpit sandwiches.
Here.
Land o' Goshen!
A real banana.
Oh, I can't take this, Barry.
Take it, take it.
Look at this.
How on earth did we get off the ground?
There's a good area.
Road, building.
Taken a few shells, but it looks in good shape.
Is that it?
Road, river, train track goin' west.
That's it.
Good.
I'll clear it with "l" Corps.
Let's go home.
Hey, Doc, you want us to take him out of here?
No, he can't be moved for a day at least.
What if the enemy comes?
You don't wanna be here.
Kid, you got a lot to learn about being a good host.
-  - I couldn't agree more.
Doc, I hate to say what I have to say.
- Who told you to say it?
- Major Burns.
Then I'm gonna hate to hear what you have to say.
He wants your chair on the truck.
You tell him if he takes this chair, my tuchus will attack him barehanded.
- Your what?
- The permanent vertical smile.
Famed in song and story.
Doc, I never even graduated high school.
- Tell him to forget it.
- Oh.
Okay.
- What's his problem?
- He wanted to remove my rest and recreation area.
- How's the boy doing?
- Slight movement in the toes.
- Oh, good.
- I think we may be all right.
- Listen, son, don't stay here too long.
- He needs 24 hours, Colonel.
I know, but if you see a cloud of dust coming down the road and start hearing Chinese band music, get this kid on a chopper and get your butt out of here.
- We'll be all right.
- Don't forget.
My wife is looking forward to meeting you.
- Kitchen's down.
- Well, that's good news.
Here.
That's it for the coffee.
Vile to the last drop.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
Then you can leave with the others.
I'm staying.
- You finally realized I have a beautiful body.
- I've never seen your body!
Every evening at 8:30.
Matinees, Wednesday and Saturday.
- Let's keep our relationship medical.
- You wanna play "doctor"?
Look, Margaret, I can handle this.
Get on the truck and get out of here.
I'm staying with you.
If you need me, I'll be packing up my troubles in my old kit bag.
Where's my tent?
- Did you yell, Hawkeye?
- Where's my tent, my clothes, my sneakers, my dirty magazines?
Captain Hunnicutt finished packing up the rest of your gear, sir.
I hope he left me a change of filthy socks.
- He take care of the still?
- Major Burns wouldn't let the still go on the truck, sir.
Fink!
He wouldn't let Klinger's dresses or my animals go on the truck neither, sir.
I can understand the dresses, but Snuffy and the Doo-doo twins?
The Smith Brothers of the jelly bean industry.
- They're careless, but they're loyal.
- Not as loyal as my still.
All it asks is a little alcohol, some corn mash, and what does it give in return?
Liquid love.
Can you keep a secret, sir?
- Scout's honor.
- Were you a Scout?
No, but I was always prepared.
B.J., Klinger and me worked out a little deal with Wat San Yee for the use of his cab.
He's gonna haul the still and the animals and the Klinger collection.
Radar, when all this is over, I'm gonna adopt you.
I've already got my mother and my Uncle Ed.
I'll sleep on the couch.
Start your engines!
Move out!
Yo!
Snuffy gets the carrots.
Pokey and the rest get the lettuce.
- Sequins all over the ground!
- Take care of yourself.
Same to you!
- Come on, Pokey!
-  - What are you doing back here?
- You might need me.
How's he doing?
-  Hangin' in there.
-  Is today the Fourth of July?
- It's September.
- Just a wild hope.
Does the enemy rape female prisoners?
Margaret, there's no reason to be afraid.
Aren't you scared?
Me, scared?
This whole body is one white knuckle.
- You don't show it.
- The minute this kid is stable and on the chopper I may wet my pants and suck my thumb.
Wow, wow.
Everybody's heading south.
The whole road's jammed up with traffic.
- Must be going to the Rose Bowl game.
- What'd you bring?
They left us this stuff.
It's a couple cans of Vienna sausage, two cans of Spam some dehydrated potatoes and some extra shoelaces.
I'll have the shoelaces, house dressing.
And have the chef remove the tips.
- Shoelaces.
- Black or brown?
- Brown.
- Then make it oil and vinegar.
Is he all right?
He's moving his toes.
That's something.
I wish to hell we hadn't torn down the still.
I could use a belt.
Rosie's Bar's still there.
Why don't you go on over?
I can handle things here.
What do you say, Radar?
Wanna walk over to the gas station for an orange soda?
Then stroll down Main Street to the dry goods store and watch them undress the window dummies.
- That's what we used to do back home every Saturday night.
- You mad fools.
Boy, the place looks deserted.
Everyone likes to leave town on a holiday.
Geez, look at all the trucks.
Nice corner for a taco stand.
Whoa!
-  - Hey!
- Yeah, yeah!
- That's tellin' 'em, Sheriff.
For Pete's sakes, run a guy down.
Tell it to Truman!
First time I ever got the best table in the house.
Rosie!
- Dr. Stud!
- With two D's.
- Time to flee.
- One last drink, my wee bonny lassie to celebrate our cowardly retreat.
But time to flee.
Rosie, who gave you the blue medicine for your gums?
Hawkeye.
Come on.
A double for me and a grape Nehi for Radar.
- No grape Nehi.
- Check the wine cellar.
I'd settle for an orange soda.
This is a special occasion.
The grape has a more memorable, artificial flavor.
There's a lady on my foot.
Oh, miss.
This probably isn't your table, but would you scratch the back of my leg?
Ah.
Found!
One grape Nehi.
- Let me see.
- Oh, boy.
Ahh.
Titillating bouquet.
Delicate coloring.
Travels well.
- It's bottled in Duluth.
- 1951.
Good year for Nehi.
Chin-chin.
Mmm.
It's still got its fizz.
Would I deny you a belch?
- Missed.
- They forgot to pack the cockroaches.
Hey, that's Blue Velvet!
- B.J.'s racing cockroach?
- Sure.
Look at the limp.
Oh, it is Blue Velvet.
One of the great thoroughbred cockroaches in Korea.
- I'm glad you missed him.
- He's sired a lot of winners.
A farewell.
Much sadness in Rosie's heart.
Tear come to eye.
To Dr. Hawkeye.
- Healer of sick.
- That's sweet, Rosie.
Tab owed You crazy, sentimental kid.
Hey!
Boy, these guys are sure in a hurry to leave the war.
- Who the hell isn't?
- Watch out!
Stop in the name of the Canadian Mounted Police!
I got an idea.
Granulated eyelids.
- Whoa.
- Don't overdo it.
Whoa, my shorts really rode up.
Good.
Father Mulcahy needs a soprano.
Able Bravo One to Able Bravo Two.
We're in C2 section, intersection four.
Affirmative.
Affirmative.
- Able Bravo One out.
- How's it going?
- Who are you?
- Dr. Pierce and his loyal minion, Corporal O'Reilly.
Captain Stevens, Intelligence and Recon.
- What's a minion?
- You fetch and carry goblets of wine you fend off knaves and varlets, and on occasion you find me a toothsome wench.
He's a fun guy.
In real life, I'm the company clerk.
- You should have gone south.
- We got a patient we can't move yet.
- Where's the front?
- You're standing on it.
Oh, to be in England now that war is here.
- Halt!
-  Convoy, halt!
-  Convoy, halt!
- Major Burns.
- Yes, sir?
- Get latrine and tent detail started.
Set up a mess pre-op and a post-op near the building.
I'm gonna check it out for O.R. Roger Wilco.
Sir, I was thinking - Colonel Potter, sir?
- What is it, Father?
I believe it's customary to bless the site of a new MASH.
Of course.
Stand by for the blessing.
Stand by for the blessing!
Stand by for the blessing!
Stand by for the blessing!
Stand by for the blessing!
Stand by for the blessing!
Hear me, oh Lord.
Hear me, oh Lord!
Hear me, oh Lord!
Hear me, oh Lord!
-  Hear me, oh Lord!
-  Hear me, oh Lord!
- I'm just trying to help.
- The padre does a single.
We thank Thee for guiding us safely to this place and ask Thy blessing that we may continue to heal and do Thy work and for a speedy end to this war I mean, uh, police action.
Uh, well, you know what I mean, Lord.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Is that it?
- Nothing comes after "amen".
- We used to sing.
- Get set up!
- Yes, sir.
Nice blessing, Father.
Standard prayer?
- It's a golden oldie.
- Hunnicutt.
Yes, sir, Colonel.
Let's look over the building.
With this retreat, there will be a lot of busted-up kids.
Right.
Looks like an abandoned schoolhouse.
Fu Manchu Junior High.
Sir, conflict.
- What now?
- We can't find the surgical equipment.
Look in the boxes marked "kitchen utensils".
The ninnies.
- Hunnicutt, do me a favor.
- Name it, Colonel.
If I'm ever shot, don't let him lay a hand on me.
Same here.
I'd hate to have that whistle sewed up inside me.
Where the hell did he get that whistle anyway?
Same place he got his diploma a box of Cracker Jacks.
- Was that you?
- I haven't giggled since my wedding night.
- Who there?
- Colonel Sherman Potter, MASH 4077.
Sorry.
No appointment.
What does she mean, "No appointment"?
Today is Wednesday.
Maybe the dentist is playing golf.
Let me try, Colonel.
I know how to knock in Korean.
Sorry.
Everybody tired.
Big night last night.
- Would you please come out here, madam?
- I think you hit it on the head.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Madam, and the others are her ladies of the evening.
Or afternoon or morning as the case may be.
Concubines in a schoolhouse?
Well, they have to learn someplace.
Again.
Don't give me that static, lady.
We're here to establish MASH 4077.
You get your concubines out of here!
- Concubines?
- Out lady, now.
Business before war.
- That's what makes America great.
- We're here on orders of "I" Corps.
General Irving R. Hamilton commanding.
Ohh, Binky.
-  - Ready to set up the O.R., Colonel.
- Stand by, Major.
- Who are they?
- Are there people living here?
- The Assistance League.
- Assistance League?
- The oldest profession.
- A bakery?
- Tarts!
Tarts!
Peach, raspberry?
Frank, it's a brothel.
A den of iniquity, in this building?
If you order before 6:00, I'm sure you can get take-out.
It's disgusting!
Colonel, request permission for an armed squad to remove them by force.
Confiscated!
Get cracking!
He took my whistle.
Look, lady, you have to move.
We're using this building for a hospital.
Look, lady, you have to move.
We're using this building for a hospital.
You gotta set up your shimmy palace in another spot.
- No.
- Listen, sister.
- Me no Catholic.
- We'll put all of you in one of our trucks.
We'll take you anyplace you wanna go.
- Throw in a case of chipped beef.
- Oh, no.
- I love that after church on toast.
- How 'bout Vienna sausage?
- Ohhh.
- That got her.
She loves Vienna sausage.
Oh, dresses!
- Pretty!
- Thank you, sis.
Hold it, babe.
That's not for sale.
That's my confirmation dress.
Girls, let's knock it off!
Give me that dress!
This ain't Klein's basement.
That doesn't look good on you.
Come on, girls.
Hold up.
Let's behave like gentlemen now!
Don't!
You're gonna tear it!
Give me that dress.
- My dress!
- That's not your dress.
I'll kill ya!
Wait a minute!
Wait!
Come back here!
I've got it.
Klinger!
All present and accounted for, sir!
Come over here.
Put that back on the rack next to the pink chiffon.
And watch the collar.
It's simulated raccoon.
You whistled, sir?
With both lips.
Step over here.
I wanna talk to you.
Son, those girls are crazy about your clothes.
They're ruining 'em.
Look at my black sheath.
Klinger, I'm the first to say you're a fine medic and a snappy dresser.
- I try, sir.
- They'll give us the building for the clothes.
What?
I got 300 clams invested in those dresses!
We've gotta have an O.R.
But my blue chiffon.
It's from Murdoch's of Toledo.
I understand.
I've always liked that dress.
My pearls won't go with anything else.
Put that chubby back!
- That's real fake fur.
- Klinger, we're gonna have wounded coming in here.
The war is going bad for us.
We need that building.
It took me three years of my life alterations, sewing my fingers to the bone staying up all night studying the Monkey Ward catalog fighting my way through snipers for the month-end sales at Wangs of Seoul.
Cowboy, do it for your country.
- My country?
- Do it for Toledo.
Toledo.
Okay, Colonel.
Ladies, the clothes for the building.
It's a deal?
Look what I got!
Look at this!
Corporal Klinger, that's the finest act of bravery I've ever witnessed.
- What's his blood pressure?
- 116 over 80.
I thought you were asleep.
I always wake up when a lady pumps her sphygmomanometer.
Besides, I don't sleep well on a soft wall.
- What time have you got?
- Time to flee.
Captain, you're waxing poetic again.
I also make candles.
-  - He's improving.
With any luck, we'll have him on his feet in time for World War III.
- Perish the thought.
- Not to mention the people.
The weather's clear.
I can see the stars.
That chopper ought to be here just after dawn.
Is he gonna be able to make it?
Well, he's got his ticket, his matched luggage and his souvenir satin pillow that says, "I have visited Korea land of the midnight mortar attack".
- How close is the enemy?
- That captain said we're in Communist territory.
Oh, thank you, comrade.
And get me some borscht.
Easy on the sour cream.
-  - Corporal, have you heard if they're taking prisoners?
I hope not.
Chop suey makes me break out   Pierce, stop that!
I'll wait in the jeep.
- Where's the hospital ship?
- Off Sinchon.
Give him a smooth ride.
- You think he'll make it?
- If they don't get a flat.
What are you doing?
A big hunk of our lives has been spent here.
Yeah, just think of all the guys we operated on.
Right, Doctor.
- A lot of them didn't make it.
- Most of them did.
You should be proud.
You too.
- We better get going.
- Yeah, let's go.
- Haven't you noticed anything?
- What?
No shelling.
No more machine gun fire.
- It's spooky.
Let's get out of here.
- Come on.
Let's go!
Now what?
- We got plenty of gas.
- I'll check the hood.
Yeah, see if the hood's okay.
Hurry up!
Nothing's where it is in my mother's Nash!
What?
- Shh.
Listen.
-  Holy Moly!
It sounds like there's a whole battalion coming down the road.
- I'm gonna be ravaged.
I know it!
- Tell 'em you're with me.
- They're getting closer!
- Let's get out of here!
What?
- Hey!
-  - Hey!
- Hey, it's us!
-  Boy, are we glad to see you!
- Convoy, halt!
Convoy, halt!
Convoy, halt!
Convoy, halt!
- Corporal.
- What's the scoop?
- Our boys beat 'em back.
We're coming home.
- Thank God.
-  - Hey, Pokey.
How are ya?
Hey, Klinger, it was really scary.
We were overrun by Chinese almost.
Big deal.
I was overrun by a batch of bimbos.
- They got everything but the dress on my back.
- Geez, what a gyp.
I can't wear this every day.
People will laugh.
Hey, how's Snuffy and the twins?
You fed 'em, didn't ya?
- Congratulations.
You're a grandfather.
- How'd that happen?
Very quickly.
I think the twins broke one of the Commandments.
- Oh!
Have a cigar.
- Thanks.
Oh, Frank, we were surrounded by Chinese.
They were breathing down our necks.
- It tickled, but I kind of liked it.
- You haven't changed a bit.
Get aboard, Houlihan.
Oh.
Yo!
Think they'll ever finish, Hawk?
Once they pass the bond issue.
- They're goin' awful deep.
- Well, they have to.
It's polluted.
Remember?
Frank fell into it.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
- Four, please.
-  Here you go.
Be careful now.
It's real hot.
- That-a-boy.
Sorry, ma'am.
-  -  - O-O-Okay.
I gotta I gotta answer the - Thank you.
-  I'm comin'.
Hold your horses.
Ahh.
MASH 4077, Corporal O'Reilly.
Tokyo?
I can't hear ya!
Wait a minute.
Major Houlihan?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
It clears the static.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll get Colonel Potter right away.
- Here you go, sir.
Three lumps, four squirts.
- Thank you, Corporal.
- Tokyo, sir.
Major Houlihan.
- Ah, yes.
- Potter here.
Hello, Major.
How's it going?
- ##  - ## - I've been up and down on a merry-go-round since I got here.
- I've hardly slept a wink.
- Well, war is hell.
What about the medical follow-up you were sent there for?
Oh, Colonel, I've checked on the progress of numerous patients operated on at the 4077 th and I have significant recommendations to recommend.
- Commendable.
-  What's all that caterwauling I hear?
I'm at the Zen Bar and Grill, sir.
General Tumwater is giving a small celebration.
Trevanian Tumwater?
Worst toupee in the Asian theater of operations, right?
That's him.
The truth is, Colonel, I have some wonderful news.
- Must be pretty big if old Throw Rug is there.
- Oh, Colonel it's not just big, it's great big, with whipped cream.
- Whipped cream.
- And a cherry on top.
- And a cherry.
- But I must tell you all in person.
- You don't trust me, Major?
- Yes, sir.
I mean, no, sir.
Of course  Of course I don't not trust you.
But the phones do have ears.
- Very well.
Report to me upon arrival.
- Yes, sir.
- And, Major?
- Yes?
Try and cheer up.
Oh, and, Radar, bring some sugar.
Coffee's on the bitter side.
Oh, right away, sir.
Holy buckwheat.
-  Clamp.
-  She didn't even give you a clue, Colonel?
Maybe she said it backwards or every other word.
Nada.
She just said we'd all be delighted.
Hemostat.
Whatever it is, she's playing it pretty close to the chest.
- I heard that!
-  Frank's right.
You shouldn't mention Hot Lips's chest when it's not here to stand up for itself.
Four-oh silk.
It seems Tumwater himself was throwing a do at the Zen Bar to celebrate.
Margaret and I both rub shoulders with some pretty big brass.
Not to mention each other.
Could be war news, maybe even peace news.
We're always the last to hear.
We'll wake up one morning and find a note pinned to Korea.
Pacifist Pollyannas.
Can't you read the handwriting in the wind?
- You know something we don't?
- Well, it's no mystery that I'm up for promotion.
From Neanderthal to Cro-Magnon.
Yukkedy-yuk-yuk.
Margaret is recommending me for lieutenant-colonelcy.
And that translates into bucks after the war.
Thank you, Daddy Warbucks.
I'm finished here.
-  What are you looking at?
- You finished already?
You missed all the fun, snoop.
I'm closing.
You took out part of a man's large intestine without exteriorizing it?
- I've learned some shortcuts, buster.
- A dumb shortcut, Frank.
- You're inviting infection.
- Colonel!
You know the procedure, Burns.
Exteriorize.
- For your information, I've never had any complaints.
- Dead men tell no tales.
- Thirty-eight cents says you don't make it.
- You're on.
- Tricky course.
- Same thing happened to the guy who invented Orange Crush.
I told you we should've played with watermelons.
Margaret.
The fighting 4077.
Somehow it's not the same place I left.
- You've been gone a while.
It's a Howard Johnson's now.
- Oh.
Driver, take this jeep down to the stalls and give it a good rubdown.
Ohh.
I understand you brought good news from Tokyo.
Oh, B.J., Hawkeye, it's too good to be true.
- Then it can't be Frank's promotion.
- No.
- Frank's demotion?
-  Silly.
It's the best of all possible "newses".
Now do you know?
- How best?
The Big Ben best?
- Uh-huh.
- The best-dressed best?
- Uh-huh!
- The war's over.
- Think big!
- Margaret, we give up.
- Okay.
Okay, sit down.
- Okay.
- Sit down.
- Sitting.
- Here it comes.
I'm engaged to be married.
- Yeah?
That's it?
- Uh-huh?
That's the big news?
Oh, silly, the ring!
What ring?
Oh, there is a ring there.
- That must have cost a pretty penny.
- At least.
I know the diamond's not so big.
It's a family heirloom.
- Must be a small family.
- I think it's in excellent taste.
Listen, who wants a pushy ring?
- Oh, they're rich, but they try not to flaunt it.
- They're succeeding.
Congratulations.
I betcha Frank would be interested in this.
- You think so?
- Don't say a word.
I want to tell him myself.
- I know he'll be thrilled for me.
- He'll be out of his mind.
-  I know.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.
That's better.
-  Ah, very uh, hmm.
I keep pinching myself to see if I'm dreaming.
You'll give yourself a black-and-blue mark.
My aunt got one at a Little League game.
Foul ball hit her in the shoulder blood clot went to her brain, next day she keeled over in her bean salad.
Colonel, he's everything I asked for when you dressed up as Santa last Christmas Virile, broad in the shoulders, straight in the back.
He sleeps on a bare piece of plywood.
- Back trouble?
- Not that I noticed.
He's a West Pointer.
He calls me his little plebe.
Here's his picture.
- Donald Penobscott.
- Fine specimen.
- Who's the gal with him?
- I think she's a cousin.
Oh.
Close family.
Lieutenant colonel, huh?
Oh, yes.
I couldn't love anyone who didn't outrank me.
Major, may I ask you something, not as your C. O - but as a friend with a lot of hash marks?
- Certainly, Colonel.
Are you sure you're not rushing into this in the heat of whatever heat you may be in?
Donald is considerate, brave and so generous.
He paid for that shower curtain out of his own pocket and it wasn't even our fault when it ripped.
Nothing new under the sun, Major.
About my follow-up report, sir Uh, some of our procedures need improvement.
I'll call a staff meeting right away.
And congratulations, Major.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- How's Major Burns taking the good news?
- I haven't told him yet.
- I have a suggestion.
Break it to him over a cup of phenobarb.
-  - I'm not kidding.
Well, Dr. Smarty-Pants I'll have you know my patient is making a rapid recovery.
- Well, that's one.
- Give me that Bible.
And keep your hands off it.
This came from an expensive curio shop at the Indianapolis Speedway.
I was only looking at the centerfold.
Funny how it fell open to Sodom and Gomorrah.
I have better things to do than to chew the fat with you two.
- He knows she's back.
- This old cowboy ain't gonna be lonesome tonight.
Uh, Frank, have you talked with Annie Oakley yet?
If you're referring to Major Houlihan I'm gonna let her surprise me with my promotion.
- Weren't you a Boy Scout?
- Yes, I was.
Later, I was scoutmaster.
Until those little ingrates set fire to his pants.
Not true.
That was a drill.
- You remember their motto?
- Uh, "Be Prepared"?
Frank Burns was never caught with his pants down.
Good, Frank.
Because in the middle of a war - there are all kinds of pain and suffering.
- Have you noticed that?
Oh, sure.
But we're doctors.
We're trained to ignore people's pain.
Frank, sometimes you have to expect the worst.
Attention!
All doctor personnel are to personally report to the Mess Tent.
- Tell 'em Frank Burns is gonna be a little late.
-  He's busy tuning his face.
- Frank - Now what?
Never mind.
It'll keep.
Hence and furthermore the progress of a patient in Tokyo depends on the quality of care - that befalls upon him right here.
- Ohh.
One of the great public speakers of our time.
- My student council could have used someone like her.
- Mine did.
Thank you for that informative report, Major.
Floor is now open for questions.
- Pierce?
- What's the capital of South Dakota?
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.
- Did I do something funny?
-  I don't know, Frank.
Did you just come from surgery?
Major Burns, we're practically finished.
You're late.
Then you'll have to brief me later, Major Houlihan.
You happen to be sitting in my traditional place, Corporal.
- You didn't call dibs.
- Four-eyes.
Is there anything further to report, Major?
Yes, Colonel.
About three weeks ago one of our patients a Lieutenant Turvey required emergency surgery in Tokyo.
Apparently, the MASH surgeon removed part of the colon without exteriorizing.
The patient later developed peritonitis.
And which of us was responsible for that?
- Oh, it was Major Burns, sir.
- Well, that's one on me.
- He's certainly being a good sport about it.
- I'd say.
- What do you have to say for yourself, Burns?
- Exteriorizing takes time.
I'm a busy man.
I've got things to do.
I'm sorry.
- Major Burns, he nearly died.
- Well, I said I'm sorry.
You don't have to make a federal case out of it.
From now on, it's strictly by the book.
This happens again, it goes on your record.
Okay.
I thought this was going to be a fun meeting.
Dismissed.
Let's go in the den and watch TV.
Oh, Margaret, I could hardly contain myself.
- When's my promotion coming through?
- You're not getting promoted.
- I'm not?
- No.
- What about the good news?
- Look.
- What?
- Look!
Look.
- Is there a bee on me?
- Frank, I'm showing you my engagement ring.
- What?
- I'm going to be married.
Get ready to duck.
He's liable to explode.
Do you like it, Frank?
What do you think?
- I think it's lovely.
- Really?
Have I ever lied to you?
Congratulations.
- Oh, I'm so happy, Frank.
- If you're happy, I'm happy.
Well, that worked out all right.
-  How's Burns taking it?
- Pretty hard.
He was clucking like a chicken last night.
-  That's not so bad.
-  Nine straight hours?
Well, we can use the eggs.
I pity the first enlisted man he sees.
-  He'll eat him alive.
- Colonel.
B.J. Hawkeye.
- Colonel.
B.J. - What about me, Frank?
- Oh, hi, Hawkeye.
-  Keep an eye on him in O.R. A lot of pressure on his cork.
I think he's ready to pop.
I'll see that he gets the kiddie scalpel, the one with the rubber blade.
Hey, B.J.?
Hawkeye?
I got penicillin from the guy at the regular price.
- It's all good stuff too.
Look at that.
- Just a second.
Black market, huh?
Regular price, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- Good work, soldier.
You may have saved lives.
- He touched me.
- You wanna press charges?
Corporal, if you need a job after the war, look me up in Fort Wayne.
You mean come over to your house and sit on the sofa and stuff?
We have covers.
Frank had his family wrapped in plastic before he left.
What kind of a job would that be, sir?
My nephew owns a chain of pet mortuaries.
Plenty of work if you like animals.
Uh, uh, no thank you, sir.
I think death gives me a rash.
And what a physique.
Shoulders like this.
Dancer's legs and a cute little behind.
That can be cured nowadays with a tushy transplant.
"Tushy transplant".
He's got medals all over his chest.
Must be tough to get his shirt on.
A wimp, he is not.
He's all man.
Some salt, please, for Frank's wounds, compliments of Major Houlihan.
Captain Pierce, must you comment on everything I say?
- Do you have to keep babbling about your tin soldier?
- Oh, let her babble, Pierce.
- I will brook no babbling.
- It happens only once in a lifetime.
I need some extra help here.
Major Houlihan?
Certainly.
Why, Major Burns, you're exteriorizing the wound.
It's the least I can do, Margaret.
Hold your finger right there.
- Good.
Best hands in Korea.
- Thank you, Major.
- So, this Penobsnott's - Penobscott.
- Penobscott.
He's a West Pointer?
- Finished 203rd in a class of 600.
- Really?
- He's brilliant.
- What is it?
- You stabbed me!
- Come on.
Hold still.
Hold still.
- That sadist.
- He did it on purpose.
- Yeah, well, if he hadn't, I would've.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you have the sensitivity of a Sherman tank.
Talking about that guy in front of Frank is a swift kick in his ego - a target one can hardly miss.
- He's a grown man, isn't he?
- Semi.
- Something wrong?
You did that on purpose.
You can take it.
You're a grown woman semi.
Since when have you ever given two hoots about Frank Burns?
It's only one hoot.
I just started.
You've given him a few swift kicks yourself.
Yeah.
But never when he was down only when he wasn't looking.
I still have feelings for the man.
I'll always have a soft spot for a real patriot.
But when I can have Adonis, why bother with Pinocchio?
When I can have hewn oak, why do I need stucco?
When I can have knockwurst, why settle for a Cocktail frank?
-  Who's there?
- Open the door and let me in, or I'll huff and I'll puff - Come in, Frank.
- You're supposed to say "Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin".
Frank, there'll be no more chinny-chin-chin, or any other part of me.
- Oh, of course not.
- Let's face it, Frank.
We're finished.
With Donald, I'll be able to pursue my army career and have what every woman wants a home, children, a washer-dryer.
I wish only the best for you, Margaret.
I came to apologize for that mishap.
Sex is out, Frank.
I love Donald.
Sex?
I have no desire to infringe on your already-spoken-for fringes.
Good.
If I've misjudged you, I'm sorry.
Oh.
When I heard you were engaged I sat down and did some hard thinking.
And there, printed right on the paper was the answer lawn mowers.
- You lost me, Frank.
- Lawn mowers, Margaret.
That's what this war is all about.
The smell of fresh-cut grass on a hot summer's day girls with straight, white teeth freckle-faced kids in striped T-shirts.
Oh, Frank, when you talk like that, l-I could May I give the bride a peck on the beak?
I don't think it would weaken the war effort.
- Frank, you moved your lips!
- Sorry, Margaret, they slipped.
- I think you'd better go!
- Just one more.
- Let me go!
I'm an engaged person!
- Now we can cheat together!
Let go of me!
- What has he got that I haven't got?
- Lips.
- Lips aren't everything.
- Don't!
I'll tell Donald!
- He'll grind you into soap flakes!
- Say "grind" again!
- Oh, stop that!
- But I have drives.
- I'll give you a drive.
- Ahh.
No fair hitting, Margaret.
Attacking a poor, defenseless woman like that!
What kind of a coward are you?
- Coward?
You call me a coward?
- That's right!
Coward?
I'll show you!
Blood 'n guts Burns.
Oh.
Oh.
It's 7:30.
Where's Burns?
Having paternal feelings?
Now I know how Dad felt the night of my prom.
When you were out breaking in your first debauch?
The hardest part was explaining the beach sand in my tuxedo pants.
Maybe Needle-Face left a note.
No telling what he'll do.
- Uh-oh.
- What is it?
- He took his gun and his toothbrush.
- Shooting his mouth off again.
Uh, I think you sirs oughta, uh, come outside.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three Company, halt.
Halt!
Did you hear me?
Major Burns presenting prisoners of war to be interrogated, sir!
- War prisoners?
- A band of enemy guerrillas for questioning, sir.
- Guerillas?
- They tried to trick me.
Masquerading as a Korean family having a meal.
- Oh, that old ploy.
What tipped you off, Frank?
- They're not so clever.
They looked a little too much like a Korean family eating a meal.
- Midgets, right?
- Check.
And the ox is a radio.
- Radar, see if they need medical attention.
- These people look hungry.
- Get them a good meal, some extra provisions.
Right away.
- I think they need clothes too.
Burns, I want you in my office.
Pierce and Hunnicutt, I'd like you to be there too.
So you lost the gal.
That's happened to all of us.
No reason to turn into Sergeant York.
I haven't given her a thought since I stabbed her.
- Will you sit down?
- No.
I prefer to remain alert and ready.
Frank, you're exhausted.
You haven't slept in 48 hours.
Bringing in that Korean family.
Why did you let them go?
There could have been a medal in it for me.
Son, heroics just get people killed.
They don't impress anybody.
Audie Murphy was turned down twice in one day, once by Miss Fresno.
- That's because he was short.
-  Major, pull in your reins.
- You're heading for a Section Eight.
- Section Eight?
- Put the rifle down, Frank.
- I'll take it, Frank.
- Stay away from me, the three of you.
- Okay, Frank.
-  Take it easy now.
- Um, there's a phone call for Major Burns.
- Who is it?
- I don't know, sir.
It's long distance.
I wonder who that could be.
Um, I'll keep an eye on them for you, Major.
Hello.
This is Major Frank Burns.
Who's this?
Mommy who?
Oh, my mommy.
Hi, Mom.
Oh, I'm fine, Mom.
No, I'm not.
Well, nobody likes me here, you know, as usual.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you see, I had this friend and this friend, um, well, just pretended to like me, you know the way Dad used to.
- He's crying.
- Catharsis.
- Gesundheit.
- Phone call couldn't have come at a better time, Radar.
- Nice work, Radar.
- Thanks.
I figured sometimes a guy's just gotta talk to his mom.
Well, you're right, Mom.
What do I care?
I can always find a new friend.
Yeah.
I am kinda sleepy.
- Nighty-night.
-  Look at that pussycat.
- Can you get him back to the Swamp?
- Do we have a choice?
Come on, Frankie.
Time for beddie-bye.
Mom, can I have a glass of water?
Sure, Frankie.
And if you're a good boy Mom will read you another chapter about Eeyore and Piglet.
- And Tigger?
- Yeah, Tigger and Pooh, all your favorites.
Donald has these enormous arms.
And he has the tattoo of a Sherman tank on his right bicep.
And he flexes this muscle, and the tank keeps getting bigger and bigger.
- The Princess of Tact is at it again.
- Miss Sensitivity.
I just get so excited talking about him.
- Oh, good morning, Major Houlihan.
- Good morning, Major Burns.
- Good morning, Princess.
- Morning.
Listen, Pierce, why don't you and I go out on the town tonight, hmm?
Well, this is so sudden, Frank.
I don't have anything to wear.
Get a couple of nurses, go over to Rosie's Bar, have a little fun.
- Sounds good to me.
- There's this little redheaded nurse who's had her eye on me.
And tonight, her wish will come true.
- Do you mean that new girl with the freckles on her nose?
- Yes, that's the one.
She's a little young for you, isn't she, Major Burns?
Oh, I don't know.
I thought a little youth might be nice for a change.
I think the convoy just took a direct hit.
If you'll excuse me, I'll just go finish my letter.
You need any help holding up your pen?
I really got her on that one, didn't I?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Okay.
3-1, Giants.
Two outs, two on, bottom of the ninth.
Three and two on Hodges.
Maglie deals.
It's cut on and belted to deep left field.
Back goes Mueller.
A-way back to the wall!
- It's a three-run homer for Gil Hodges!
-  She's gone.
The Dodgers go from bums to kings and win it 4-3!
Come on, Frank.
Shut up, will ya?
Geez, it's 4-3 in the morning.
This game will be rebroadcast at 1200 hours on Armed Forces Radio.
Frank, come on!
- ##  - Stop dreaming and go back to sleep.
Oh, that makes good nonsense.
- Hawkeye?
- Yeah?
- Wake up, Hawkeye.
- The stove in our tent went out.
- Again?
- It's freezing in there.
- It's warm in here.
- There are four of us.
I knew I should have gotten a bigger bed.
Can you people hold it down?
I mean, show some consideration.
I don't remember leaving a wake-up scream.
Thanks, Hawkeye.
You're the only one who can fix it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
B.J.?
- Hmm?
If I'm not back in five minutes, don't come and get me.
Good night, Frank!
Here he is, girls, Handy Andy.
- Hey, Mr. Fix It.
- Let's hear it for the janitor.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you, Hawkeye.
It's freezing.
- Well, what do you expect?
Springtime in Korea.
-  You should feel honored.
We chose you 'cause you have the best hands in camp.
I try to keep in touch.
- Be careful, Hawkeye.
-   Oh, knock it off, Pierce.
Radar, call the 121 st Evac.
I want their ophthalmologist.
Tell 'em we got a boy with flash burns.
Major James Overman.
Get his keister up here pronto.
-  -  Get him in here, quick!
I can't see anything!
Now look, you dumb clerk.
I'll tell you this once and I want you to get it straight.
This is General Walter O'Reilly.
Three stars and real mad.
If Major Overman isn't over here by the time they crack my powdered eggs for breakfast I'll have you digging a latrine for every G.I. In Korea!
You got that?
Good!
- How's that feel?
- Blind.
Okay, Hawkeye.
You take it easy for a couple of days.
- I'll be back Friday.
- Listen.
One important question.
- Will I get to keep my nickname?
- Let's hope so.
Just wondering if I should rent a Seeing Eye dog or buy one.
See you Friday.
Tell me, Sherm.
Where is this General O'Reilly?
Who?
Oh, well, let me explain.
We're really sorry, Hawkeye.
You don't have to shout.
The sides still work.
- We're sorry.
- That's all right.
Next time, get a union man.
Hawk, if there's anything you need Well, if you're going by the P.X., you could get me a coloring book and crayons.
I think you're sick enough to qualify for the big box.
I gotta go.
- B.J.?
- Yeah?
Visit me a couple hundred times, will ya?
At least.
- Nurse?
Nurse?
- What's the matter?
My arm's numb.
I think it's asleep.
Let me take a look at it, so to speak.
Where are you?
- Is there a doctor in the house?
-  What is it, Pierce?
Oh, Frank, I'm glad you're here.
Go get a doctor.
Now, what are we trying to do with this patient, hmm?
Arm wrestle.
Only I have a slight advantage his bandage is too tight.
I'll take care of that.
Now, let's scoot back to our bed.
Okay?
We don't want to bother the other patients now, do we?
Hmm?
Keep it up, Frank.
We'll get our nose busted.
Somebody will be with you in a minute, okay?
Sorry.
Just bumping through.
Huh.
Claude Rains.
I'm Doctor Pierce.
Anybody home?
Hi.
Tell me what this says, will you?
You're a real funny man, aren't you?
Come on, fella, give me a break.
Can't you see I can't see?
No.
No, I can't.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
A grenade landed I caught most of the stuff in the face.
And you?
I offered a light to a temperamental gas heater.
- I didn't get your name.
- Oh, I'm Tom Straw.
- Hiya.
- Hi.
Hawkeye Pierce.
Where you from, Tom?
- San Francisco.
- Beautiful city.
Yeah.
I'm looking forward to getting back and not seeing the Golden Gate.
- You trying to depress me?
- No, no.
I'm too busy depressing myself.
Look.
You're alive.
Maybe you should feel lucky.
Do you feel lucky, Hawkeye?
Not lately.
What'd you do back in San Francisco?
- Taught high school English.
- Well, you can still teach.
Be grateful you're not an airline pilot or a truck driver.
Or a doctor.
Right.
Pierce, I thought we agreed we were going to stay in our bed.
No, we agreed that we were going to loosen that kid's bandage.
Did we?
- I was on a break.
- Burns, I swear I'm a better doctor blind than you are with both eyes.
- Nurse!
- Yes, Doctor.
Kellye, help me re-bandage that kid down there.
Then fill me in on everybody in here.
Frank, you can go back to what you were doing nothing.
Ow!
- Where is it?
- Right here.
Colonel, how am I supposed to maintain order in there with Pierce stumbling around, trying to help everyone?
The nurses can't take a temperature without reporting to him first.
And he's always touching them.
Disgraceful.
He's got no business being in there if he's sick.
- I suggest we ship him back to the 121 st.
- Why?
Oh, I'm sure he'd be a lot more comfortable.
I appreciate your concern.
You're right.
- He should be moved.
- Well, thank you.
But I don't think it's necessary to take him any farther than the Swamp.
- But l - And to avoid the inevitable argument dismissed.
"And the rest of the family is doing fine.
San Sandy Falcon," I think - Yeah.
- "Asked about you.
She still sweats" No, no, that's Oh, she's sw"She's still sweet on you".
Who's Sandy Falcon?
A girl who used to dip my pigtails in the inkwell.
So obnoxious, she was voted most likely to marry out of her species.
Oh.
Uh, "Take care, Son.
We're really" - Hold it.
I'm ready to try again.
- Oh, sir.
Come on.
I think I can do it this time.
Come on.
Okay.
Here one, two.
Get outta my light.
- Do I have to chase them again?
- No.
Let 'em lay there till they get it right.
- Finish reading the letter.
- Yes, sir.
Um, "Take care, Son.
We're connecting the dogs" That's "counting the days," Doodles.
"We're counting the days.
All my love".
Major Burns.
- What?
- Major Burns is coming this way.
##  Pierce, you disgust me.
Right, Frank.
I discussed you with everyone I know.
They all think you're disgusting.
Handicapped people usually know how to act properly.
Oh, come on, Frank.
I'm just trying to keep busy.
Look.
I even made your bunk.
Did a good job, Pierce.
But it's not regulation.
The "U.S." Goes on the outside of the blanket.
I wore this with just you in mind.
You make me wanna throw up.
See?
It pays to dress.
Hawkeye, did you really make Major Burns's bunk?
Why not?
I'm used to short-sheeting in the dark.
- It's me, Corporal Klinger.
- I heard the hair on your legs rustling.
Hawk.
Is it okay if I go to the Mess Tent?
They got fried shrimp for lunch but you gotta be one of the first six guys in line.
- Bon appetit.
- That mean "yes"?
Yes!
Yes.
- How you doing, Captain?
- I feel as good as I look.
Hey, Klinger, silk, right?
Always bright and breezy.
Listen, Captain.
I brought you something.
Good.
Have her sit on the edge of the bed and tell me when you're gone.
Sorry, sir.
All I got for you is this.
In case you ever need us, just toot.
-  - Perfect.
It was either that or a howitzer.
- I can't get my lips around a howitzer.
-  - Yes, sir.
What can I do for you?
- Works like a charm.
Would you like to escort me to the art museum?
- We don't have an art museum.
- I'll settle for the latrine.
- Your limo awaits.
- Lead on, MacDuff.
- Don't hit that.
- I'm sorry.
Low bridge.
- We're outside.
- Aha.
I bet we're drawing stares from all the other couples.
I look fabulous, but you look a trifle frumpy in your fatigues.
You never looked better to me.
Here we are.
- Need any help in there?
- Not since I was two.
Watch your step.
- Corporal Klinger?
- Ma'am.
Colonel Potter wants to see you on the double.
He needs your help to pick out a present for his wife.
- I'm kinda busy, Major.
- Are you disobeying an order?
All right, but you'll have to stay here and wait for Captain Pierce.
Very well.
- Oh, Margaret.
- That's very good.
It's your perfume Moon Over Fort Dix.
It's Forbidden Furlough.
Where do you wanna go?
Mess Tent.
Then after that, we can go over to your place and play blindman's bluff.
- Savage.
-  - Head.
- ##  ##  - Here.
You take him.
- Right away, Margaret.
I'll bet I'm the only hot potato in this entire tent.
Here you go, Hawk.
Oh, how convenient.
It's in Braille.
- Now let me tell you what they got.
- No, no.
Let me guess.
- Creamed spinach.
- Incredible.
You can smell it?
- No.
I could hear it.
- Uh, try a little of that.
- Last week's bread?
- Close.
This week's meat loaf.
What you don't eat, they drop on the North Koreans.
Dodgers are down to their last strike - Hodges.
- As Hodges waits on the two-two pitch.
Maglie delivers.
Just inside.
Those Giants stink.
I think the Dodgers will win.
-  - Oh, what's so funny?
Sir, the Giants got 'em 3-1.
All they need is one more out.
Oh.
Oh, well, uh, do you guys ever bet on these things?
Okay.
3-1, Giants.
Two outs, two on, bottom of the ninth.
Three and two on Hodges.
Maglie deals.
It's cut on and belted to deep left field.
Back goes Mueller.
A-way back to the wall!
It's a three-run homer for Gil Hodges!
The Dodgers go from bums to kings and win 4-3!
Thanks, suckers.
Very good, Frank.
- I bet he could have called that one in his sleep.
-  Colonel, have I ever told you about our world-famous Crabapple Cove Lobster Festival?
Radar.
Go ahead, Hawkeye.
I'm listening.
For two days and two nights, but drink beer and gorge themselves on the biggest, reddest, juiciest lobsters you've ever seen.
And then at sunset Hello, Radar the boats start coming in.
Hold the boats.
Radar, what's this requisition for 300 rubber gloves?
We're almost out.
On New Year's Eve, we used them for balloons.
- Oh, yeah.
- I remember one year it got so cold - we bundled up in rubber gloves.
- Right, Hawk.
Get me that requisition for blankets, Radar.
Yes, sir.
Right away.
Where were we?
Oh, yeah, the lobster festival.
Right.
One year I went down to a deserted cove with, uh three baskets and a little home wrecker named Sharon.
"Sharon Share Alike" we called her.
We were there for four days.
Never got to the lobster.
Four days and never got to the lobster.
Colonel!
Radar!
Oh, son, I'm sorry.
I thought I'd only be out for a second.
Forget it.
I just got a little nervous.
It would have been worse if you were here and snoring.
Hawkeye, this is Radar O'Reilly speaking to you now.
- Uh-huh.
How would you like to take me for a little walk, Radar?
- Wanna hit some more golf balls?
- No.
Post-op.
- Okay.
Colonel, I'll be back to tell you the story about the two priests and a mule.
- You'll get a kick out of it.
- Door's always open.
I hope so.
Otherwise, I'll break my nose.
Radar, how would you like to get your money back with Major Burns?
- Is this doing something sneaky?
- Of course.
Oh, boy.
- Here's the bedpost.
- Welcome aboard.
Thank you, Radar.
It's been wonderful traveling with you.
- Will you be needing me anymore?
- Ah, no - but if you're ever in town again, I'll give you a call.
-  - Beej?
- Yeah.
How's the Straw kid doing?
Okay.
We're about to send him down to the 121 st.
- L-I wanna see him.
- Right away.
- Mr. Straw.
- Yes.
I have here Hawkeye Pierce, new boy in your English class.
Ah, yes, Pierce.
Third row, second seat, big mouth.
The very same.
How you doing, Tom?
Not very well.
I tried to write a letter to my wife this morning.
I only got as far as "Dear Marilyn".
Try, "Darling, I'm coming home".
She'll be thrilled.
How thrilled will she be when I tell her the rest?
Don't sell her short.
Captain, which one is "Straw, T.S., Lieutenant"?
Right here.
- Movin' out, sir.
- Movin' out.
I'd like you to write to me, Hawkeye.
Only if you promise not to send the letters back corrected.
It's a deal.
I really wanna know how things turn out for you.
- Thanks.
- Give my regards to Mill Valley.
And remember me to Union Square.
- So long, guys.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Beej, let's get in the jeep and go for a ride.
You drive.
- Hawkeye - All right.
I'll drive.
Look, will you settle down for five minutes?
Sit down.
I know what you're trying to do, and I know how you feel.
No, I don't think you do.
You don't wanna think about what might happen, so you keep running.
No, that's not it.
That's not it.
No.
Look.
Look.
When Doctor Overman comes in here and unwraps my package I hope to God I'll have my sight back but Something fascinating's been happening to me.
What's that, Hawk?
One part of the world has closed down for me, but another part has opened up.
Sure, l-I keep picturing myself on a corner with a tin cup selling thermometers, but I'm going through something here I didn't expect.
This morning I spent two incredible hours listening to that that rainstorm.
And l And I didn't just hear it.
I was part of it.
I'll bet you have no idea that that rain hitting the ground makes the same sound as steaks when they're barbecuing.
Or that that thunder seems to echo forever.
And you wouldn't believe what how funny it is to hear somebody slip and fall in the mud.
I bet It had to be Burns.
Beej, this is full of trapdoors, but l-l I think there may almost be some kind of advantage in this.
I've never spent a more conscious day in my life.
All right, Pierce.
This area's been deemed off-limits to personnel in your condition and I'm giving you one minute to clear out, starting now.
- Frank - Fifty-five seconds and counting.
- Frank, do us a favor and defect.
- All right.
That's it, mister.
- No more chances.
Orderly!
- All right, Frank.
Here we go!
- This is your one chance for a fair fight.
- You asked for it, Pierce.
- I can take you with both eyes tied behind my back.
- Easy!
- Who's this?
- It's me.
Where's Frank?
Nurse Able!
Do me a favor.
Get him outta here, will you?
Say something, Frank, so I'll know where to spit!
- Who's this?
- Able, it's Able.
He's lucky you stepped in.
You're lucky I didn't let him kill you.
- Girls, we have company.
- Oh, hi, Hawkeye.
At ease.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
Oh!
Gotta be Bigelow.
- How'd you know?
- Never mind.
What can we get for you, Hawkeye?
I just had it a second ago.
Listen.
Uh, could he come back in a little while?
I was gonna undress and take a shower.
Well, don't let me stop you.
I won't see anything.
And you can throw me out if I so much as drool.
- Go on.
- That's one.
Well, I can't do it with him in here.
Come on, Lieutenant.
He can't see anything.
Okay, Hawkeye, but no more comments.
##  - It's no good.
- You want more sax?
Oh, forget it, Hawkeye.
Come on.
You gotta get outta here.
Wait a second.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Chopper's coming.
It's a pleasure working in here today, sir.
- How so, Major?
- Well, we're busy, lots of casualties.
-  Terrific.
- And no sign of Pierce.
- Party's over, Frank.
- Sir, isn't it against regulations to have a blind man in surgery?
Ask Captain Pierce.
He's chief surgeon.
Be nice, Frank.
I'll let you sign my face.
Boy here took a bullet in the abdomen.
- What are the damages?
- Not too serious.
- Lacerated iliac artery.
Clamp.
- Clamp.
Wonder what the patient would think if he woke up and saw me standing over him.
- He'd know he was in the army.
Clamp.
- Clamp.
Beej, you oughta sit back sometime and listen to the war.
- It sounds as bad as it looks.
- Are you ready to close, Doctor?
Was that intestine perforated?
I'm getting a whiff of bowel.
I ran it.
It was okay, but I wanted to check it again.
You're right.
There's a small nick.
Who was that masked man?
Indians lead it 5-4 in the bottom of the ninth.
One out, and the Yanks better get something going here.
- Rizutto steps back in.
-  The pitch swung on and missed.
Strike two.
Oh and two to Rizutto.
- Big Bob Lemon goes into his windup.
-  - Here comes the pitch.
-  Line drive!
Base hit to left!
How about that!
Listen to that crowd!
-  - It's 5-4, Indians.
One out in the bottom of the ninth.
Coming up for the Yankees, Gil McDougal.
Red Hots!
Get your Red Hots!
Peanuts here!
Goulash!
Here's the next pitch.
Swung on and missed.
Strike one.
The infield looks for a bunt.
What do you say, kid?
You and me.
Burn it in here.
Come on, baby.
Windup and the pitch.
Swing and a miss.
Strike two.
Wait a minute.
He caught part of it.
Ball rolls down to short.
Picked up, over to second, back to first.
Double play.
Cleveland wins it 5-4.
That score again Cleveland 5, Yankees 4.
That'll do it for tonight.
This is Bryan Moxey signing off.
This program will be repeated at 1200 hours on the Armed Forces Radio Network.
Sorry I was late, Hawkeye.
I couldn't get a chopper.
That's all right.
I was just sitting around listening to myself sweat.
Now, Hawkeye, shade your eyes.
Now open them slowly.
Well?
- Five, right?
- Yeah.
They work.
Here's the results of yesterday's game.
Yanks 8, Indians 1.
For those who'd like to collect, Major Burns is in post-op.
Oh, that score can't be right.
I listened to the game and -  - Major.
-  Frank, I want my $10 now!
-  Thanks.
- Thanks, Major.
- Thanks, Jim.
That compound is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Congratulations, Hawkeye.
You're a lucky guy.
Yeah, I got lucky twice.
First I got the chance to see without my eyes, and then I got 'em back.
-  Come on, you guys!
-  - Nurses?
- Hawkeye, what happened?
Temporary relapse.
They were working okay this morning, and then they went.
-  - Well, it's not permanent.
- The doctor says they'll be okay in a few days.
-  You poor guy.
Well, what can I tell you, girls?
I need all the sympathy I can get.
Well, is there something we can do?
No, you just do whatever you were doing.
Set your hair, iron your undies, get undressed.
Oh, isn't it awful?
A relapse.
- Maybe we could cure it.
- How?
- I don't think I should have done that.
- Out!
Watch it!
Watch the eyes!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
- Anybody open?
- One buck.
- I call.
- I'm in.
- Call.
- I'm in.
All right.
Cards?
Three.
A-one, a-two, a-three to you.
Whoo-hoo.
Ha!
The great poker face.
Keep it up.
You'll make Mount Rushmore.
Three.
Who deals these cards deals trash.
- Father?
- Two, please.
One, two, buckle my shoe.
Father, I thought you were supposed to trust your fellow man.
Not when there's eight dollars in the collection plate.
- Woodruff?
- Four.
Come on.
You'll give it away.
- Klinger?
- Three.
A face card and a deuce, huh, Klinger?
- Come on!
- Your nose is the mirror of your soul.
- I'd like to use that sometime.
- Oh, I'd be flattered.
Dealer takes three.
Hee!
- Uh-huh.
Radar?
- One buck.
- A dollar to you, uh, Father.
- Without even a peek I will raise it two dollars.
- Special glasses?
- The Vatican P.X. - Three to you, Woody.
- Call.
- Garbage.
- Two to you, Smiley.
- Full house.
Threes over deuces.
-  Boy, I must be ahead about 12 bucks.
I can buy my mom some more electrolysis.
The gift for the woman who has everything.
Well, I gotta go.
Sit down, laughing boy.
I'm out 85.
Deal!
Daddy needs a new garter belt.
I'd like to play some more, but I've gotta fill out the morning report the monthly report, type four letters for Colonel Potter - and massage my gums.
- It's almost midnight.
Uh, I'll see ya.
Thanks a lot for all the swell money.
I hate a guy who quits early when he's ahead.
Woody, when Radar says he's got work to do, he means it.
If it weren't for that leprechaun, Well, I should go.
I promised Finch I'd stop by post-op.
He's in for dysentery.
- Ah, my favorite holiday.
- How much you out, Father?
Sixteen.
Well, unlucky at cards, unlucky at love.
Yep.
There goes my new garter belt.
I'll have to hold up my stockings with Band-Aids.
- Ingenious.
- Stings.
Pulls clumps of hair off my legs.
That's what those were.
I thought they were wounded rats.
I'm ready to pack it in.
Time for beddy-bye.
- As us butch guys say at the front.
- See you at breakfast.
- Not me.
It's porridge.
- I found two eggs.
Under a snake.
Well, what do you say, Woodruff?
You owe me 85.
Uh, get ya next time.
- How's that?
- I ain't got it.
- You should've gotten out of the game.
- You owe me 35 from last week.
Guys, I got obligations.
I also play poker at H.Q. Good, 'cause you're not playing here anymore.
- Oh, come on, guys.
- No, forget it.
You stiffed us twice.
Oh, okay, okay.
Look, don't get sore.
I, uh, got something better than money.
Yeah, your health.
But I can't spend your health.
Look, I'm in charge of the "l" Corps mimeograph setup.
And I'm in charge of spleens and small intestines.
You guys know what comes out of mimeograph machines?
- Waste paper?
- Promotions.
I can promote you.
How would you like, uh, Major Hawkeye Pierce?
I'd rather be Dr. Pierce with a liquor store in front and surgery in back.
How about you?
You want to be Major B.J. Hunnicutt?
- What's so funny?
- Play this on your mimeograph machine Lieutenant Radar O'Reilly.
##  - Don't you ever salute, Corporal?
-  Well?
Anything for me?
Uh, just your aftershave lotion, sir.
You little poop!
You planned that whole salute!
##   Come!
It's me Uh-oh!
- What?
- Mail call, sir Uh, ma'am.
Uh, that's a package from Lieutenant Colonel Penobscott, your beloved betrothed-to-be.
I know who he is!
Oh!
Oh, that thoughtful darling!
He knows I love fine leathers.
Aha!
Wahoo!
- Yahoo!
- Aah!
-  - Wahoo!
- Yahoo!
-  I asked for communion wafers, and they sent me Ritz crackers.
Gee, I'm sorry, Father.
Supply is mostly Presbyterian.
Mercy, mercy.
Did they at least send the biblical bookmarks?
Oh, yes, sir.
Uh, it's, uh It's athletic equipment.
You know, slingshot.
With a slingshot like that, I think David could have slain two Goliaths.
-  - Come in!
Mail call, Lieutenant Baker.
Radar Why do you always leave so quickly?
Hit and run?
You know how the mail is.
It doesn't wait for hail or sleet or rain - or bad spark plugs or whatever.
-  I think I'm caught in your towel.
- Radar.
- Hmm?
What about us?
- You mean you and me and you?
- Uh-huh.
When are you going to make a real delivery?
I left the mail on your bed.
Radar, how obvious can I be?
You can kiss me if you want.
Oh, no, no, no.
L-I don't think that would be very fair.
All is fair in love and war.
No, I mean I think I'm getting a strep throat.
Besides, you're an officer.
I'd be happy to salute you.
Whoa, that stang!
##  #Wah, wah-wah # - Klinger.
- My colonel?
- Knock off the "wah-wahs".
- Yes, sir.
But it's a group arrangement.
Just cut.
And watch my wart.
In my hands, your wart is sacred.
- Mail.
- Anything for me?
Just junk mail.
You wanna sell your house?
- We rent.
- Then you didn't get any mail.
- How did I do?
- Pretty good, sir.
A letter from your granddaughter.
- Oh!
Open it and read it.
- Well, it might be personal.
What could a five-year-old kid write that's personal?
- Oh, potty stuff and - Read it!
- Yes, sir.
- ##   #Wah-wah ## - "Dear Grandpa" - Bright kid for five.
- Made toast at three.
- I put milk on my cereal at four.
Good man.
Go on.
"Mama says, 'How are you?
' Mama says, 'I am fine.
' Mama says, 'I hope you are fine too".
'  "Mama says, 'Don't play with ashtrays 'cause they're furniture".
' -  - "O-O-O-X-X-X".
- That's hugs and kisses.
- Oh.
- Anything else?
- Uh, yes, sir.
This came from "l" Corps.
- Read it.
- ##  "From: R. J. Meighan, Commanding Officer, 'I' Corps.
"To: Sherman Potter, Commanding, Mobile Army Surgical Hospital 4077.
Regarding the prom-m-m-m"  Well?
Take it easy, kid.
"Re: The promotion of O'Reilly, Walter corporal, 3911810 to second lieutenant, U.S. Army Reserve".
Well, I'll be John Brown!
You've jumped from corporal over sergeant, to second lieutenant!
It must be a mistake.
I'm just a kid.
No mistake.
That's your serial number.
That's war.
Crazy things happen.
Friend of mine was a plumber one day and in charge of the Panama Canal the next.
You son of a gun.
Let me lay one on ya.
- Aw, come on, Klinger.
At ease.
- You better get used to it, Lieutenant.
- Oh, my gosh!
- Keep one thing in mind, Herr Leutnant.
Be nice to us G.I.s. You were an enlisted man yourself once.
Remember.
Absolutely fan-damn-tastic!
"I" Corps probably heard you were doin' a great job, kid sir.
Well, I have been practicing on my spelling.
Did you hear about Radar?
- His hamster win the Kentucky Derby?
- He's a second lieutenant.
- You're kidding!
- No fooling!
Just can't figure it out.
Does a good job.
Everything in triplicate.
Sharpens my pencil every day.
- Outgoing in the outgoing box.
Incoming in the incoming box.
- Who could ask for anything more?
But corporal to second lieutenant?
There's gotta be an answer.
A reward for heroism.
Something like throwing himself on a live grenade.
- I saw him throw himself on a case of rotten Spam.
- Ate the whole thing.
I'd like to see the boy get ahead, but it's so cockeyed.
- Maybe Colonel Blake put him in for it.
Yeah.
- And it just took time.
- I'm gonna check with "l" Corps.
- I wouldn't do that, Colonel.
Uh, you start challenging their decisions, they get cranky.
- I better check.
- Um, um, Woody.
Yeah, the guy to call is Master Sergeant Woodruff.
- Know him personally?
- His mother and mine were in the U.S.O. - Entertainers?
- No, uh, jelly doughnuts.
I hate jelly doughnuts.
Radar!
- Oh, he's, uh - Oh, the lieutenant is still delivering the mail.
How do you start this confounded thing?
- That's a mystery.
- Only two people can work that thing.
- Radar and Sergeant Marconi.
- Yeah.
You'll never get him.
- Hello?
"l" Corps?
Got 'em.
- Oh, good.
- Master Sergeant Woodruff.
- He's probably not there.
No, he's there.
Sergeant Woodruff.
Oh, yes, Colonel Potter.
The O'Reilly promotion?
Oh, I'll, uh, I'll look it up, sir.
Yes, sir, I have it right here.
Uh, efficiency, punctuality and bugling over and above the call of duty.
Thank you, Sergeant.
- The promotion's legitimate.
- The promotion's legitimate.
- Oh, really?
- Bugling?
My horse can bugle better than him.
- Maybe your horse is up for promotion too.
- From gelding to stud.
- That'd be unusual.
- Forty years in this man's army I've never seen a soldier promoted because of his lips.
If he could play tuba, he'd make colonel.
I'm just kidding, Colonel.
Just, you know, joking.
Keegan?
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
- This is mine.
- That's mine.
Look at the mark.
Can't you read Korean?
Tall man, black hair, snotty attitude.
This is yours.
See?
Taller man, many teeth.
Use extra soap on shorts.
I resent that.
You could eat off my shorts.
Hi, guys.
Sirs.
Oh, dear.
Is it time for your rumba lesson?
No, I just come over to show you somethin'.
Don't tell me.
You're growing sideburns.
Continental, yet depraved.
Come on.
I don't have sideburns.
Look.
You're letting your armpits grow.
Look again.
- Got a hickey?
- Harder.
Hawkeye, Radar's a second lieutenant!
-  - I thought it was a laundry mark.
- Congratulations!
- Thanks a lot.
It's a real surprise.
I'm tellin' ya, it just come outta the blue.
I'm not surprised, the way you've been workin'.
Totin' that barge, liftin' that bale.
- Not getting drunk and landin' in jail.
- Had to happen.
- It was in the cards.
-  Yeah.
What's he doing in officers' country?
Careful, Frank.
Check the collar.
That's blasphemy!
You can be shot for impersonating an officer!
They haven't shot you yet, Frank.
Don't sass me, fella.
I'm turning him in.
You'll hang from the highest yardarm in this man's army.
- Frank, yardarm is navy.
- Gendarme is army.
Sir, look.
I don't understand this.
A short, nearsighted, uneducated, lower-class clerk makes lieutenant?
That's Frank's way of saying congratulations.
Oh, thank you, sir.
- Now, O.R. Shortages.
- "Shortages".
Sulfa, I.V. Tubing, rubber gloves masks, sutures, four-oh silk.
- You got that, Lieutenant O'Reilly?
- Uh, yes, ma'am.
"Lieutenant O'Reilly".
I'll never get used to that.
Me neither.
Jenkie bottoms, when I made corporal I broke out in hives.
Tell me the truth, O'Reilly.
Do you have a relative distant relative who's maybe a general, an admiral, big brass?
My Uncle Howard's a notary public.
Anybody can be a notary public.
He's also a dance instructor.
Nitwit.
Uh, okay, ma'am.
I'll go to supply and get this stuff.
- Negative!
- What-a-tive?
You are commissioned.
You do not perform menial tasks.
Designate authority, Lieutenant O'Reilly.
Get some enlisted men and start in Supply and take care of the O.R. Yes, ma'am.
Uh, ma'am?
- Now what?
- Is it okay if I try the officers' latrine?
Of course.
Oh, boy!
National Geographic!
Okay, guys, up, up.
Oh, buzz off, O'Reilly!
- Oh, come on.
- Shove.
Hey, I hate to do this, but I gotta give you an order.
You guys gotta take some stuff over to O.R. Never fails, right, Igor?
You make a guy an officer, and he turns into a fink.
- Ain't it the way?
- Does he remember when you lent him - that Oh Henry bar for the movies?
- Uh-uh.
Does he remember all that good garbage - you gave him for his hamster?
- Beats me.
- Exactly.
- Come on, Zale.
Just because a guy makes officer doesn't mean you gotta walk all over him.
Look, I'm gonna tell you once more, Tiny Tim.
Shove.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Okay!
I'll tell you what you do.
You take this and you fill that out.
Then you deliver it to O.R., okay?
And that's an order!
I'd really appreciate it.
Thanks a lot, guys.
- Radar.
- Look, see?
I'm an officer now.
I'm allowed to do that.
So I heard.
And you're not allowed.
No, uh, ma'am, you remember when you caught me in your towel and you said you wanted to kiss me?
Well, it's legal now, and I'd really like to try it at least once.
Lieutenant, you don't understand.
I love the underdog.
I used to root for the Saint Louis Browns.
What happened to you and me and you?
Lieutenant, you still don't understand.
- You're no longer forbidden fruit.
- I'm not?
Mm-mmm.
I'm confused.
You liked me.
Now you don't like me?
Lieutenant O'Reilly, report to Colonel Potter.
Uh, Lieutenant, the colonel is paging you.
I mean, just because I got a new uniform?
I've got bars?
- Radar!
- That's Ooh, that's me!
Report to Colonel Potter.
I'm not a clerk!
I'm a medic!
Every time I answer the phone, I gotta take off an earring!
Maybe you shouldn't wear the earrings.
Just because you're a lieutenant don't make you a fashion consultant.
Crazy army.
Wish I could hear through my nose.
Well, is Klinger getting the hang of the job?
He's doing just fine, sir.
- Lf you need me, I'll be lancing a boil.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, let's get going, Klinger.
- Call me "Corporal".
- Why?
- I have to call you "Lieutenant".
Not when we're alone.
Criminies.
You know me, Lieutenant.
I'm G.I. All the way.
I go by the book.
- Wearing dresses?
- But always in the best taste.
Let's get on with this stuff.
First there's the radio.
See this switch here?
That turns on the power.
See the little red light?
- Cute.
- Okay, now, I just wanna review for a second.
- What's this little red light mean?
- Tinkerbell's alive?
Come on.
Be serious.
Geez, when I'm out doing second lieutenant stuff, you're in charge here.
Joy to the world.
All right now, look.
This whole thing also runs the P.A. System, right?
Now watch me, please, because l-I'm gonna make an announcement.
Okay?
This This switch here, you switch to P.A. See?
Okay, now you pick this up.
You hold it like this.
All right?
Now before you talk or anything, you test it.
You blow.
- Announcement coming over.
- If the war's over meet me under the clock at Grand Central in 10 years.
- We'll go dancing.
- I lead.
Then you buy.
This is just a test.
Testing.
Testing.
Five, four If I'd known there was going to be a test today, I would've studied.
If I'd known there was going to be a test today, I would've studied.
- See?
Okay, now, why don't you try one?
-  No, no, no, no.
That's too wet.
You'll get it all rusty.
- How'd the boil go, Sherm?
- Gangbusters!
You call the old man "Sherm"?
Sure.
Officers always call each other by their first name.
- What'd you call me?
- Colonel, sir.
Colonel.
He's a little cranky when he, uh, lances a boil.
- Here, now you try an announcement.
- Like what?
Oh, the movie tonight.
Here.
Just read what's on this paper.
- Will this make me a star?
- Aw, come on.
Stop horsin' around.
- Attention, all personnel.
- Hold it.
- Now what?
- Forgot to blow.
-  - No, no, don't spit.
Blow.
I'm Lebanese.
We're full of the juices of life!
Attention, all personnel.
"The movie for tonight: One Ticket to Broadway starring Lyle Bennett, Mitzi Price, Leonard W. Grossman".
And Teddy the Wonder Lizard.
Come on!
There's no lizard in there.
Will you stop foolin' around!
There's no lizard in that picture.
That was Two Lizards to Broadway.
Oh, for Pete's sakes, Klinger, can't you do anything right?
Get off my back, Lieutenant!
- You're just jealous!
- I hope you choke on them bars!
Oh, yeah, let's do a test!
Too wet!
- You're right!
-  - Halt!
Who goes there?
- Lieutenant Walter O'Reilly.
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Password.
- Where's Igor?
- Wrong!
- Igor, for Pete's sakes, get up!
Come on!
- What's the matter?
You're on guard duty!
You could be shot.
- Why, did the kid fall asleep?
- What if an officer caught you?
An officer did.
What is this child doing with a rifle?
- Password.
- Oh, shut up!
Wrong again.
Put this man on report, Lieutenant O'Reilly.
Now you see the trouble you got me into?
Lucky for you I wasn't asleep.
They would've shot you.
Fink.
Look at this.
- R. J. Hardlidge has been named "Nudist of the Year".
- Great credentials.
-  - Entrez- vous.
A born headwaiter.
- Sirs?
- What do you want, shavetail?
Uh, sir, l-I wanna talk to the captains.
You little snip!
You just wanna talk about me behind my back, don't you?
No, sir.
I wanna talk about me, sir, behind my back.
- Frank, will you excuse us?
- I'm plucking the hair from my mole.
Do it Sunday.
I'll serve cocktails.
- Come on, Frank.
Beat it.
- Nerts.
Why don't you go talk to Margaret?
I think I saw Margaret out walking before.
- With her whip.
- Wearing boots.
Gee, maybe she wants to be friends again.
I thought he'd never leave.
What's up, motorman?
Hawkeye  I got a big problem.
- You're chafing again.
I told you, keep dry.
- And plenty of talcum.
No, no, no, it's up here.
I'm goin' loony.
Insanity is just a state of mind.
What's up?
Well, you know, the first time somebody salutes you, it's really swell.
But now Geez, Zale hates me.
Igor hates me.
Klinger really hates me.
I mean, holy cow, I'm not one of the guys anymore.
And I don't fit in with the officers either.
When I was enlisted, I kept wishin' I was an officer.
- Now I'm an officer, and I hate it.
- The brass is always greener.
Klinger's got my old job, and he's spitting in the microphone.
Puts the red folders with the blue folders.
He made a choker out of my typewriter ribbon.
And, geez, I'm so lonesome.
All I got is - Your teddy bear?
- Yeah.
Would you like to be an enlisted man again?
- Can you guys do that?
- We're doctors.
- It's an easy operation.
- Simply have somebody remove your bars.
- How low would you like to get busted?
- No lower than corporal.
That way I can keep up the payments on my mom's electrolysis.
Good thinking.
Cheer up, soldier.
Your demotion is in the bag.
Congratulations.
You're no longer a gentleman.
- Can I take these off now?
- No, I wouldn't.
You could get in trouble.
An officer impersonating an enlisted man.
- Oh, Hawkeye, thank you.
- It's okay, Radar.
Thank you, B.J. Gee, how can I ever thank you?
- You could give us your firstborn.
- And an order of fries.
- Do you know any fast girls?
- You know any slow ones?
Mmm.
Oh, boy.
- Like it?
- Oh, yes, it's really swell.
Except I'm sweating all over the mail.
I have to go on duty now.
I'll, uh, see you tomorrow.
Right.
Well, what if you don't get any mail?
Wing it, stud.
- So?
So?
What happened?
- Oh, come on.
- What did you do in there?
- First base?
Second?
Third?
Home plate?
- Come on!
I don't kiss and tell.
- Aw, struck out!
No!
I don't have to tell you.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
If Brooklyn can hold on to any part of this lead they'll remain 41/2 games ahead of the onrushing Giants.
New York has won 16 of the last 18 games while the slumping Dodgers have only seven wins over the same period.
It's 7-4 here in Cincinnati in the bottom of the eighth.
Nobody on and one down and the Reds are up to bat.
-  The Reds are up to bat here too.
- They're hitting us pretty good.
-  He who lives by the bat dies by the bat.
-  Very good, Hawkeye.
You need another unit of whole blood.
Get with it, Walsh.
-  Let her get her engine started, Margaret.
- I'll handle the nurses.
I'll be happy to help.
Margaret, my brains are on fire.
Towel.
Towel!
-  Fastball cut on and missed.
-  Give me some suction.
Newcombe has Bell in a hole as he looks into Campy again.
- Thank you.
- The windup, the pitch and a swing and a miss for strike three good change-up.
Gus was way out in front of it.
And down he goes.
- Well, at least he went down swinging.
- That's the way I want to go.
Colonel, permission to kill the radio.
- Granted.
- Only four more outs for his -  It melted.
- You and your hot little hands.
Never mind her hands.
Go change your gloves, Sweeney.
You're contaminated.
-  I never touched her.
-  Anybody got an ice cube hat?
-  Or a snowsuit?
-  I think I just had a hot flash.
Colonel, are you gonna let them discuss female diseases with ladies present?
It's not a disease.
It's a symptom.
That's one for her, Burns.
- Preston, don't contradict the doctors.
- Or Frank.
Can it, doggie breath.
I need more three-oh silk.
- We're out, Doctor.
- I told you to check Supply.
- I did, Major.
We're out.
- You should have anticipated.
-  We have four-oh silk, Doctor.
Will that do?
- Well, it'll have to.
Colonel, we can't go on like this.
No supplies.
No water.
- It's been a week since anybody's had a shower.
-  I know.
It's beginning to smell like the inside of a whale around here.
Imagine what Jonah must have gone through.
Some people have the courtesy to sponge in their helmets.
Do you go in the deep end?
- Baker, get that tray organized.
It's a mess.
- Just the way I like it.
- It's the maid's day off.
- Well, it's not procedure.
And I'll thank both of you to stop interfering with my staff.
I wouldn't touch your staff with a 10-foot nurse.
Hemostat.
Oh, not that, you ninny!
The other thing!
But you asked for the hemostat.
Don't give him what he asks for.
Give him what he needs.
- Give him fatter lips.
- Major, this woman is impossible!
- I demand a nurse.
- Listen, mister, don't call me -  Mister?
- Dr. Burns to you!
- Seems like a lot of conflict in here.
-  Right, Padre.
Everybody, calm down!
Lieutenant Preston, just for that you're in charge of cleaning up the O.R. After this session.
Yes, Major.
He may be a lot of things, but he's no mister.
Thank you.
Fudge.
You're kidding.
It's 110 degrees outside.
- Oh, this stuff will cool by October.
-  I'll wait.
- We'll add the nuts in September.
-  - Whoop.
-  I have your assignments for tomorrow.
I hope that's not what I think it is.
- We won't know what it is till September.
-  Why don't you guess, and we'll tell you if you're right.
You're drunk.
You know you're not supposed to be cooking in here.
I can't help it.
I always get cooking when I get drunk.
Be careful or you'll go on report.
Report?
Heavens to Betsy.
Next thing she'll make me stay after school.
I will not tolerate drunkenness.
Major, I already did my duty with 17 hours overtime and three cardiac arrests.
You can't upset me.
I'm numb.
I don't even feel sad with burn patients that look like mummies.
That's why I'm drinking, to feel something.
Lieutenant, when you sober up, report to my tent.
Major, why don't you leave her alone?
You're in enough trouble with that peroxide on your hair.
In case you have forgotten, it's against regulations to steal from Supply.
Is that one natural blonde to another?
My hair has always been this color!
- You mean blonde with black roots?
-  - I don't have black roots!
- All right.
Gray.
- You rotten little - Oh, come on!
-  - Major, come on!
Forget it, all right?
All right?
-  - I've had it with you, Baker.
You're on report.
Your orders will be posted.
- Fudge.
-  Fudge.
I'm fine Mom "I'm fine, Mom".
Uh, "But, boy, is it hot here.
Somebody even broke into the little snowflake paperweight you sent me for my birthday".
- Ooh.
- Excuse me.
Yeah.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
- That's okay.
I'm just writing my mom a letter on how hot it gets here when it gets hot here.
- Okay.
- Yeah?
- You know where I can find Lieutenant Baker?
- She's in her tent.
But I don't think she's allowed to see people.
I'm not people.
I'm her husband.
You must be the guy that married her.
- Right.
I'm Tony Baker.
- Uh, Corporal O'Reilly.
- Well, uh, so what's the problem?
- Uh, no problem.
She got into an argument with Major Houlihan, and she's confined to her tent.
Oh, perfect.
We didn't have a honeymoon.
I just got a 24-hour pass, and I figured I'd surprise her.
Oh, wow.
Hey, listen, maybe I could sneak her out for a minute.
You could wait in the Swamp.
- In the Swamp?
- Yeah.
Come on.
I'll show you.
Okay, but I want this to be a surprise.
She hasn't seen me in two months.
Boy, you think the army would try to fix it so guys that are married with each other could be in the same outfit.
- Here she comes.
- Let's act crazy, so she doesn't suspect anything.
- Surprise!
- Here she is!
Right this way, please.
- Right down there.
- What's going on?
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
Mickey Baker, this is your life!
- ## - Hawkeye Out of minutes of exhaustive research, comes a remarkably dull story - starting with your birth somewhere in the U.S. Of A. - Radar Shortly thereafter, because of a keen mind and body to match you were allowed to skip infancy and go directly to the third grade - where you were heard to say - Oh.
"When I grow up, I want to be in the Korean War".
- Are you all drunk?
- And then there was high school.
- I'm getting out of here - Remember those years?
-  Sad, mad, glad, crazy, funny.
- Then a restaurant in Seoul.
You were sitting alone, when you heard a voice say -  - When you heard a voice say - Hi.
Is this seat taken?
- Tony.
Tony, where are you?
Oh!
Tony, I don't believe it!
Where did you come from?
From under the bed.
Boy, this is even better than the real program.
- What program?
- You mean there's a show like this?
- I hear you're in trouble.
Does that mean I can't see you?
- I'm confined to quarters.
- I've got to be back tomorrow.
- I'm due in post-op in 10 minutes.
- Don't worry about tonight.
B.J. And I'll fix it.
- We will?
For being on our show, this lovely young couple will be flown at great expense to a tent 30 feet from where we're standing where they will spend a glorious evening in the Olive Drab Room of the Continental Korean Plaza overlooking the fabulous latrine - compliments of the wonderful people who brought you this war.
- Yea!
How can we be together?
I'm restricted.
Let's not talk medicine.
Let's talk romance.
The night belongs to lovers.
Oh, boy.
He got me with that one.
Captain, I know this may sound like a frivolous question, but what the hell are you doing?
- Quarantining your tent.
- Quarantining my tent?
What for?
There's a very sick soldier in there.
Looks like the plague.
The plague.
What plague?
Looks like bubonic.
We can't be sure yet.
It's gonna take about - Corporal.
-  Yes, ma'am?
- Yes, ma'am?
- Is there really a sick man in there?
Oh, uh uh, if I were you, I wouldn't suck in any air, Major.
-  - Do you mind?
I'd like to see for myself.
You want to look in there?
Inside there?
Of course.
It's gonna be a very rough night.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Why do you always have to inconvenience me?
- Where are we gonna put him?
- Why not put him in Father Mulcahy's tent?
We thought about that.
But if the good father got the plague who would give him the last rites?
- I need my things.
- Yeah, we thought about that.
I packed your toothbrush, your jammies, and one of your slingshots.
You jerkface!
That's my garter belt.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I try not to look at your unmentionables.
I told you not to mention that.
Colonel Potter's gonna hear about this.
Pierce, I want the facts on this fella in Major Houlihan's tent.
Colonel, he had to be quarantined.
The only reason I borrowed Major Houlihan's bed is she lives alone - with good reason, may I add.
- You may not add!
- Subtract that.
- What's he quarantined for?
- About 24 hours.
- The disease!
Oh, the disease.
I'm glad you asked that.
Because there's a very simple explanation.
My partner.
At first we thought it was, um, the plague but then we've narrowed it down to either typhoid or schistosomiasis.
Schistosomiasis?
What kind of nonsense is that?
- No, no.
I've heard of that.
It's very common.
- Really?
Millions of people contract it by wading waist-high in the river Nile.
- Exactly.
Now if you'll excuse us, Colonel.
-  Not so fast.
How do you suppose a foot soldier in Korea a fair distance from Egypt, caught this disease?
Um, maybe he went home to see his mummy?
Doctors, cut the comedy.
What, if anything, is wrong with this boy?
Colonel, he shows all the symptoms of typhoid.
Now, we-we-we can't be sure.
We just have to quarantine him for a while to find out.
Twenty-four hours ought to do it.
You're gonna let them get away with whatever it is they're trying to get away with?
It's only for a day.
The boy's quarantined for 24 hours.
- Where am I supposed to sleep?
- With the nurses.
- With the nurses?
- Have them set up an extra cot.
- Isn't there some other way?
- Why?
Is that a problem?
No.
Of course not, Colonel.
If it is, I can sleep with the nurses and Major Houlihan can sleep in the Swamp - if she doesn't mind snoring.
- Won't bother me if she snores.
I'll take the nurses, thank you.
- Save a couple for me.
- Dismissed!
I'm getting a headache.
You know, I always dreamed I'd honeymoon in Niagara Falls.
- Oh.
Richard and I had the bridal suite there.
- Really?
Yeah.
If we ever get married, I'd like to go back.
- I'm so nervous.
- Why?
You sneak over to see Tony.
You get back before dawn.
Nobody's gonna be the wiser.
It's not that.
I'm worried about getting a bath.
Well, it just so happens we took up a little water collection around camp.
Oh, really?
That's sweet.
- Can you fit into a coffee cup?
- Oh.
I got a little honeymoon present for you.
I was saving it for an emergency, but, uh, it's just a few drops of perfume.
Thank you.
What's it called?
I don't remember.
The first time I used it my boyfriend chewed off the label.
- What's the matter?
- Private Parker just died.
Who's that?
One of the kids in the burn section.
You remember?
He was always flirting with Gaynor.
Hey, I'm sorry.
- Try not to take it so hard.
- I'm not.
That's just it.
We were friends, and I don't feel anything.
I don't feel death anymore.
It's just death.
- Oh, now.
- Well, I don't have any candy.
You never know what you might find.
Oh, uh, you children get out of here.
I don't understand what those kids It isn't necessary to make them feel afraid of me.
I happen to love children.
We thought you might confine them to their huts.
Very funny.
All right.
I want this place to sparkle.
Everything sterile, all instrument packs complete.
Check all trays and inventory all supplies.
Also, due to a shortage of beds, I'll be forced to sleep in the Nurses' Tent tonight.
That's right.
Mine's been quarantined.
I'm sure you're no more pleased about it than I so I suggest we all try to make the best of it.
Hot Lips in our tent.
- That'll be like sneaking past a watchdog.
- We'll chloroform her kibble.
- We'll rock her to sleep.
- With a real rock.
I don't care if Margaret has to sleep with the nurses tonight.
What's that to me?
She hates the idea.
She'd rather spend time with anyone else, even you.
Frank, this is your big chance.
Hawk and I will clear out of the Swamp and you can invite Margaret over for a little Apache dance.
I'm not chasing Margaret!
I'm waiting for her to come to me.
- How's that?
- You guys don't know a thing about women.
- Then how come he has a baby?
- I'm playing hard to get.
I'm making her suffer.
- There's sweat on her upper lip.
- Frank, it's 110 degrees.
When I see her crawling across the compound on her hands and knees - you know what that'll mean?
- She ate in the Mess Tent?
No!
It'll mean that she's almost ready.
Till then, no dice.
I think we crapped out.
- Well, how do I look?
- Sensational.
Oh, gorgeous.
Is that what we're supposed to look like?
- I think so.
- Mary Jo got it in Tokyo.
And I think it's a little big through here.
Look, I loaned you my nightgown.
I can't loan you everything.
You don't think it's too much?
I don't want to look overanxious.
He might like that.
Here comes Houlihan.
Quick, under the covers.
- The light.
- Oh, I forgot.
- Now, are we supposed to be asleep or just dozing off?
- Mary Jo, shut up.
Well, what's this?
Everybody in bed on time for a change?
Well, Major, early to bed, early to rise.
No bull session?
No coffee tonight?
No, Major, we threw it out.
Good night, Major.
Good night.
- Halt!
Who goes there?
- Baker.
Uh I was going to the latrine.
It's the other way.
Uh, Klinger, I, uh, don't really have to go to the latrine.
- You don't?
- No.
- I see.
- Um, listen.
Don't, uh, ask any questions and, um my lavender peasant blouse is yours.
- With the matching scarf?
- Mm-hmm.
Pass.
-  l - Shh.
-  Who is it?
- Um, it's Corporal O'Reilly.
I was just wondering if I'm bothering you?
Uh, come on in, Radar.
Oh, no.
Listen, I don't want to see your honeymoon.
It's all right.
Come on in.
Come on.
I was just leaving.
Tony has to get back to his outfit.
Oh, gee.
I just thought maybe you'd like some breakfast.
Um, if you scrape the black off of it, it's toast under it.
Thanks, but, uh, I have to shove off.
- Take care of yourself, sweetheart, okay?
- Okay.
Write me.
- I will.
- We will.
Oh, gee.
Pardon me.
I'm sorry.
L-I guess I'd just better be going.
Would you tell Hawkeye and B.J. Thanks?
Oh, sure.
I will.
Gee, love is swell.
- Good morning, Major.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
This time I'm gonna throw the book at you.
- What have we got?
- Got a pregnant one here.
She's in labor, and it's a breech.
-  Get her prepped.
- Right.
- Chopper's on the pad.
- Looks like a sellout.
Attention!
Incoming casualties.
All personnel report to pre-op immediately.
- Major, can we talk to you?
- About what?
About what you're gonna do to Lieutenant Baker.
- What does that have to do with you?
- She's our friend.
- We don't want to see her in any more trouble.
- Then you should've stopped her.
- Let's go.
- What'd she do that was so wrong?
She spent the night in my tent with a quarantined soldier.
That soldier was my husband, and it's the first time we've been together since our marriage.
- It was a violation of rules.
- Oh, come on, Major.
You've ruled, regulated, and reported us to death.
You're in the army, and the army means discipline.
We know that.
But once, just once, can't you show a little compassion?
And once, just once, couldn't you be honest with me?
Last night was just another joke, just another lie to Major Houlihan.
How can we be honest with you?
You're like a cat waiting for the mice to make a mistake - so you can pounce.
- Let's face it, Major.
You don't trust us.
And do you trust me?
You act like I'm the enemy.
All right.
If I had asked your permission last night, what would you have done?
- I would have said no.
- See.
Not because it's against regulations, but because of the rotten way you've treated me.
The way we've treated you?
What are you talking about?
Did you ever show me any kind of friendship?
Ask my help with a personal problem?
Include me in one of your little bull sessions?
Can you imagine what it feels like to  To walk by this tent and hear you laughing and and know l-I'm not welcome?
Did you ever once ever offer me a lousy cup of coffee?
We didn't think you'd accept.
Well, you were wrong.
Radar, I want to see it.
I want to see that culture report.
- The-The culture report.
- On the fella who was quarantined.
- You remember him.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
That fella.
He was a real nice guy.
But, uh, I think he got better, because we released him.
- Released him?
- Yeah.
I thought he had typhoid!
Oh, that's right.
But it was just the 24-hour kind.
Ooh!
- What?
- I forgot.
Doctors, tell me about this miracle cure you've discovered for typhoid.
- Oh, it wasn't, uh, typhoid.
- Our diagnosis was all wrong.
It was just a cold trying to fool us.
- You wanna stick with that story?
- I'm working on a better one.
Keep working and follow me.
Major Houlihan, we've been had.
You and me.
Your tent was used last night for some devious shenanigans.
If you'd like to level charges, I'll understand.
I know all about last night, Colonel.
It's a private matter between me and my nurses.
-  That's the end of it?
- Yes, sir.
Whatever you say, Major.
Let's get ready.
Look at that.
Anybody got a cigar?
- I didn't even know we were pregnant.
- You delivered it?
Not it.
It's Miss Su Ling Sun.
- She was a breech.
-  She may have come into the world backward, but she landed on her feet.
- Oh, isn't she beautiful?
- Just like her doctor.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm crying.
It's just life.
- You're getting the baby all wet.
- Yeah.
- Not to mention wasting water.
-  Why are we making fudge again in this heat?
The last time we made it, Baker threw it all over the front of the tent.
Now I'm gonna throw it against the back, so it'll match.
Try some.
It's good.
Mmm.
What we don't eat, we could always use to waterproof our boots.
- Evening, nurses.
-  Good evening, Major.
I have your assignments for tomorrow.
I hope that's not what I think it is.
No, Major.
It's fudge.
- Cooking in the tents is against regulations.
-  Yes, Major.
Have some?
Oh, that's really bad.
How about a lousy cup of coffee?
I'd love it.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
- You having much pain?
- Not much.
- But I'm a little groggy.
- I'm a little groggy myself.
- Wanna lie down?
- You better save your strength.
- Major.
- Oh, Able, I'm glad you're here.
I need some rest.
Yeah, you really look beat.
Good, but beat.
- Thanks.
- Good night.
It's nearly morning.
Halt!
Who goes there?
Klinger, you're a disgrace to the army.
Thank you, ma'am.
I'm doing my best.
I'll escort you to your tent.
- Over my dead body.
- That's possible, Major.
Some North Korean prisoners have been released in the area.
An attractive person like yourself might be in danger.
Of course, the same is true for me.
I can take care of myself, Cinderella.
I understand this is a good neighborhood to pick up sailors.
- Oh, can it.
- Halt!
Who goes there?
She's either surrendering or signaling for a touchdown.
-  - What the hell is she saying?
Her mother's giving birth and needs help.
I'll get my bag.
This is what happens to you when you don't eat your vegetables.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
- But, ma'am, that's dangerous!
- I'll be fine.
If anything happens to you, can I have your clothes?
##  - Klinger, I'm here to relieve you.
- Good.
Undo my bra.
I usually don't let guys do this on the first date.
##  Ooh.
Looks like you're gonna be wearing a bigger hat for a while, soldier.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I can't make this out.
When did he last have morphine?
I can't read it either.
It's Major Houlihan's writing.
- Gee, she writes bad enough to be a doctor.
- Get her here on the double.
- What if she's not dressed?
- Bring her in her birthday suit.
My pleasure.
I'll get her.
We took enough shrapnel out of you to build a jeep.
Two seconds to go.
Celtics down by one.
Pierce with a 50-foot hook shot.
He makes it!
The crowd goes wild!
They spill onto the court.
He's smothered with cheerleaders.
Girls, please, there's enough to go around.
- Girls!
Whoo!
- Are you okay, sir?
Never better.
Have you ever been attacked by a squadron of cheerleaders - shaking their pom-poms in your face?
- No, we never had cheerleaders.
- My condolences to your libido.
- Right.
Uh, sir, I'm looking for Major Houlihan.
Oh, Radar, you little devil.
It's not for me, sir.
It's for Colonel Potter.
- That's even worse.
He's a married man.
- Come on.
I gotta find her.
- Have you looked in her tent?
- Yeah.
So have I, but she keeps catching me.
Two points!
Let's ask the average G.I. Excuse me, sir.
I have a question for you.
That must be the one I ordered last week.
Where is it?
- It's in my mouth.
- Spit it out.
The corporal here and I are looking for a Major Houlihan.
Sorry, but I know a geisha house in Tokyo where you can get a minor Houlihan.
Come on, guys.
This is important.
I've just been in the shower, and I didn't see anyone in there with clusters like Margaret's.
Will you guys pipe down!
There's a doctor trying to sleep here!
- Then shut up, Frank.
You might wake him.
- And nuts to you.
- Master of the half-witticism.
- What are you doing here, grunthead?
- I'm trying to locate Major Houlihan.
- You mean Major Houlihan, sir.
I don't know what to call her anymore.
She says "ma'am".
You say "sir".
##  Any mindless baboon can see she's not here, including me.
- Now get out!
- Okay!
But I'm telling you.
It's really spooky.
It's like she disappeared.
- Check Houdini's tent.
- People just don't disappear.
- Tell that to Amelia Earhart.
- I hope Margaret's all right.
Trust me.
She's great.
How can you make jokes when she could be lying out there in a ditch somewhere with two broken legs, with rats and bugs crawling all over her?
- Frank, stop it.
You're getting me excited!
- Suppose the Chinese got her.
- Suppose King Kong got her.
- Could be.
She's always been a little bananas.
- We can't just sit around.
We gotta do something.
- You're right.
I'll shave.
- I'll take a shower.
- Where's my shirt?
- Here.
- You used my shirt as a basketball?
Had to.
Your underwear wouldn't bounce.
- Hey, Klinger?
-  - Uh, Klinger?
- Mom, I don't wanna go to school today.
- I've got a headache.
- It's Radar.
Radar, I don't wanna go to school today.
- Have you seen Major Houlihan?
- She's having a baby.
Klinger, you're dreaming.
Honey, let's get back in the front seat.
Here come the cops.
An officer shouldn't go out looking like this.
You're right, Frank.
And that wrinkled shirt doesn't help either.
- Where I'm going, nobody cares how I look.
- That could be anywhere.
- I'm going out into the jungle to hunt for Margaret.
- I understand she's game.
Don't be a smarty-pants.
She's probably been abducted by Chinese heathens.
They have her hanging upside down by her feet from a bamboo tree doing unspeakable things to her.
Speak a few.
Frank, if you don't put that gun away, I'm gonna find a new holster for it.
##  ##   You moron!
You could have killed me!
It was an accident!
It ricocheted off the footlocker.
- I'll ricochet your nose off the footlocker.
- What happened?
- Hopalong Ferret Face just shot me in the leg.
- I'm sorry.
- Let me take a look at it.
- Will you respect me in the morning?
He just grazed it.
You're gonna have to have a couple of stitches though.
- Help me get him into O.R. - Frank, you're a credit to the enemy.
I said I'm sorry.
What more can I do?
Put an apple in your mouth.
We'll play William Tell.
Say, Beej, you're not gonna report me or anything, are you?
-  Frank, stop acting like a sniveling idiot.
- I'm not acting!
-  Get away from me!
- Just promise you won't tell on me and get me in trouble.
Huh?
Please?
Pretty please?
-  We promise, Frank.
-  What happened here?
- Frank shot B.J. - Tattletale!
Stool pigeon!
Fink!
Indian giver!
-  How bad is it?
- Superficial.
Fortunately, Frank's as good a marksman as he is a surgeon.
How's your horse, sir?
When I was a kid, my daddy used to take me to the pony rides - How did it happen, Burns?
- You mean - Right.
- I was cleaning my weapon, and it discharged prematurely.
Sir, I think the Chinese have captured Major Houlihan.
I see.
So naturally, you shot Captain Hunnicutt.
- Well, what's so funny, Corporal?
- Sorry, sir.
Don't blame the boy, Burns.
He knows a goodjoke when he sees one.
- Colonel, permission to go out and find the major?
- Permission denied.
- But - No.
I'll be in my tent.
-  - A mental pygmy.
- Now, what's the story on Houlihan?
- Nobody's seen her.
- Strange.
- I've checked with everyone from Nurse Able to Sergeant Zale.
- "A" to "Z".
Very methodical.
- I try to use the alphabet whenever I can, sir.
- You must have missed someplace.
- I've looked everywhere except the nurses' showers.
Oh, no, sir.
I couldn't look in there.
There might be naked female personnel showering with their clothes off.
- What's the big deal?
- Oh, well, "nudidity" makes me breathe funny.
Affects me the same way.
Do it.
But, sir, couldn't we find somebody else, like maybe Captain Pierce?
No, we'd never get him out of there.
You're the man.
I Yes, sir.
- Hello?
-  Radar, get out of here!
- Don't be scared.
My eyes are closed.
- What do you want?
- I'm just looking for Major Houlihan.
Is she in here?
- No, she's not!
- Oh.
Well, then, I'll just go then.
- Good.
- Good.
- Radar!
-  - No, remember, breathe.
-  - She's gonna be fine.
Hold it, no!
Don't push.
Don't push.
Ah.
Uh   Got a little problem here.
She'll be fine.
The cord's around the baby's neck.
I just have to move it.
It's okay now.
Major Houlihan is here to help you.
Just promise me you won't grow up to be a North Korean.
Medically speaking, Frank Burns is a beanbag.
- Put it in layman's terms.
- He belongs in a rubber room.
He's nuts!
- I agree he's a pain in the neck.
- Try three feet lower.
But you gotta give him an "A" for resourcefulness.
How many doctors do you know provide their own patients?
Excuse me, sirs.
I was just looking in the nurses' showers.
I told you you wouldn't go blind.
- Any luck?
- No, sir.
Nurse Baker was the only one in there.
If that's not luck, I'll eat my socks.
Radar, call the M.P.s. Ask 'em if they've seen Major Houlihan.
- Yes, sir.
- And then ask them if they've seen Gone With the Wind.
Pumpkinhead!
Now my lip's going to swell up!
- Might even get to normal size.
- Go twaddle in your tent.
- What is it, Burns?
- Well, Colonel, I'm still worried about Margaret.
- We're all worried, Major.
- But I'm more worried than anybody else.
- It's not a contest.
- Sir, I just don't feel like I'm doing enough.
You're doing fine.
It's only 10:00, and you've already shot a doctor.
Sir, I called the M.P.s. Nobody's seen Major Houlihan.
- Well, I better turn this over to Intelligence.
- That lets you out, Frank.
- I'll call "l" Corps - Ring up "l" Corps Tell the M.P. S to search all native vehicles.
Alert the M.P. S to check all native vehicles.
Sir, I'm willing to help in any way I can.
I know I'm a real asset.
You're only off by two letters.
I'm telling you, Sparky.
It's weird.
If a full-size person like Major Houlihan can just disappear think what could happen to my rabbit.
He could be kidnapped by some Chinese magician.
-  -  Uh, Spark, I gotta go.
Colonel Flagg just come in.
Okay, pip-squeak, what tipped you off?
Uh, well, you don't look anything like you, sir.
And since you're a master of disguises, I figured you're the only one who couldn't look like you that much.
I'll buy that for now.
But if you ever cross me up, you're gonna get a number eight.
What's that?
Have you ever heard of the Malaysian chest implosion torture?
- No, sir.
- Good, 'cause there's no such thing.
- Yet.
- Right.
I'll get Colonel Potter for you.
- Hold it!
- All right.
Nobody tells anybody I'm anywhere.
- Right.
- Including me.
With you in a minute, Flagg.
Nice suit.
Your clown outfit in the cleaners?
Don't try to be funny with me, Colonel.
I've trained myself not to laugh or smile.
- Really?
- Watched a hundred hours of The Three Stooges.
Every time I felt like smiling I jabbed myself in the stomach with a cattle prod.
- That ought to do it.
- Let's can the small talk.
Fill me in on the Houlihan case.
Well, she's been missing since last night.
We've looked everywhere.
Everywhere?
There's no such thing as "everywhere".
I'm gonna change and poke around a bit.
Pardon me for asking, Colonel, but why are you dressed like an Italian usher?
- Can you keep a secret?
- I think so.
I'm disguised as Ling Chow, Chinese double agent.
Funny, you don't look Chinese.
Neither would Ling Chow if he were dressed like this.
- Follow me?
- As far as I'd like to.
- Well, I'm off.
- I couldn't have said it better myself.
- How's the leg?
- Not too bad.
When I blow on my big toe, my thigh whistles.
Don't be such a namby-pamby.
It's just a little hole.
- Like the one in Frank's head.
- Pound it out your porthole.
- Come in.
- I'm already in.
- He's so light on his feet.
- Shut up.
- If you have anything to say, keep your mouth closed.
-  Can it.
What happened to your leg?
- Cut myself shaving.
- Another comedian.
- Where's Houlihan?
- I think it's near Dublin.
That's insubordination.
You do that to me one more time and I'm entitled to bite off your left ear.
- Just food for thought.
- He's not bluffing.
He got van Gogh.
Let me tell you something.
I have a complete record on you.
I know every move you make.
Everything there is to know about you, so watch your step, Hunnicutt.
- I'm Pierce.
- Fine.
You wanna call yourself Pierce, I can play that game too.
- This won't look good on your record.
- It's only Reader's Digest.
Not when you eliminate the third, fifth and sixth letters.
Then it's Red's Digest, Comrade.
- But, Colonel - Listen, Pinko!
You're my prime suspect.
- Isn't it true you had a torrid relationship with Houlihan?
- No, sir.
- You wanna see the films?
- Films?
- I'll get the popcorn.
- You were insanely jealous of her engagement.
You were furious at being rejected.
You were capable of murder.
That's right.
So you hit her over the head with a blunt instrument.
- The saxophone.
- Then you hypnotized her and told her she was Johnny Ray.
Then you performed plastic surgery.
Made her look like Johnny.
The rest is obvious.
You stuck her in a trunk.
You mailed her to Las Vegas.
And now she's doing two shows a night at the Sands.
- Three on Saturday.
- There's only one flaw in that theory.
- Only one?
- They don't do three shows Saturday night at the Sands.
- How do you know?
- I was a showgirl for six weeks.
- Colonel Potter, sir.
- Radar, you can call me either Colonel or sir.
- You don't have to call me both.
- Yes, sir, Colonel.
That's better.
Now, what is it?
The Korean ladies are here for their baby birthing lesson.
And Major Houlihan and I usually do that, so I was wondering  If I could help out and give the lecture to the Korean ladies.
- Sure.
- Thank you, sir.
Sometimes that stuff makes me gag.
- I'll be gentle.
- Good morning, my colonel.
- Klinger, you look lovely in yellow.
- Always a gentleman.
- Now the contractions are getting really strong.
-  When you feel one, you take a deep breath and push.
Radar.
- Between them, you relax and breathe normally.
-  Now we're getting near the finish line.
Another contraction and you can see the baby's head appear.
So you take a deep breath and push.
Take it easy, Radar.
You don't wanna shoot him across the room.
Now as you gently rotate the baby's head the shoulder will appear.
And once the shoulders are delivered, the rest of the body slips through easily.
- Swoosh!
-  Swish!
But it doesn't sound like that.
Congratulations, Mrs. O'Reilly.
It's a bear.
A C.I.A., F.B.I., Intelligence man drinking?
I'm not drinking.
It just looks like I'm drinking.
- You had me fooled.
- Two years ago in Morocco I had a device surgically implanted in my throat that neutralizes alcohol.
That way the enemy can never get me drunk.
- I find that hard to swallow.
- I heard they do that to get the truth out of you.
Nobody can get the truth out of me because even I don't know what it is.
I keep myself in a constant state of utter confusion.
That's the best way to keep things organized.
Making yourself at home, Flagg?
I have no home.
I'm the wind.
- I told you he was the wind.
You said he was the stars.
- No, I said he was the moon.
Listen, Colonel Wind, would you mind blowing your butt off my chair so I can sit down?
Very well, Colonel.
Time for me to get up anyway.
- I only sit two minutes a day.
- It's bad to put pressure on your brains.
Glad you're here, Potter.
I want you all to hear my plan.
If it's your plan, sir, I'll bet it's a good one.
Burns, you interrupt me one more time, I'm gonna drop a grenade down your shorts.
Got it.
Now, I have searched the entire camp and Major Houlihan is not here.
I think the Chinese got her.
I have been in this business 20 years and I'm not interested in the speculations of an amateur.
- What's your theory?
- The Chinese got her.
That's what I said, sir.
What?
Oh, nothing.
No, it's Nothing.
Now, I want a platoon of rangers to parachute into North Korea to search and destroy anything that moves.
- But, Colonel, Margaret moves!
- Who would know better than Frank?
Colonel, let's not cause any unnecessary casualties.
- What's war without casualties?
- Peace.
If it wasn't for war, you wouldn't know what peace was!
- He's got a point there.
- Yeah, it's under his hat.
All we're interested in is getting Major Houlihan back.
- I'll get her back.
- Dead or alive?
Right.
Alert the navy for offshore artillery.
I want a squadron of copters for air-to-ground search and, uh, round up a box of scorpions.
About a dozen.
- You mean, uh, scorpions scorpions?
- Big ones.
- What the hell are you gonna do with a box of scorpions?
- It's personal.
Gift for a friend.
That's it.
Get moving.
Corporal!
If you can't find scorpions get two snakes and a rat.
And a rat.
Right, right.
- Afternoon, Major.
- Corporal.
- I see everything came out all right.
- Isn't he beautiful?
He sure is.
In my family, every baby had a nose like a hawk.
Here.
Take him and his mother over to post-op.
I'll be there in a minute.
How do you breathe through that little thing?
- Anything happen while I was gone?
- I ripped my pink pedal pushers.
Other than that, it's been very quiet.
Coochie, coochie, coochie.
Stop that.
You wanna call out the entire 315th Air Division?
That's gonna make a lot of noise.
Why don't we just drop an atomic bomb?
Hey, don't try to make friends with me.
I've been sitting here quietly for a long time, and there's something I'd like to say now.
- What is it?
- Good-bye.
-  I'll join you.
- Go on ahead, you two bleeding hearts.
Colonel Flagg and I don't need you.
My father touched me like that once.
To this day, he still has to wear orthopedic shirts.
- Margaret!
-  -  Hold it!
- Colonel Flagg.
Don't anybody touch her.
She may be booby-trapped.
Wait a minute, Flagg.
Where have you been, Margaret?
I went down the road to deliver a baby.
Didn't Klinger tell you?
- Klinger!
- He probably forgot.
His mind isn't what it used to be.
- Maybe he's going through menopause.
- We were worried sick!
Well, Flagg, it was fun while it lasted.
Count on me.
I can find anything.
Can you find my virginity?
I lost it 20 years ago.
I haven't seen it since.
Radar!
- Get on the horn.
Call off the whole shebang.
- I just did.
Sir, what about your scorpions?
That's all right.
I'll get some from home.
Well, I guess you've got better things to do, Flagg, like torturing sheep.
As a matter of fact, I do.
Now, everybody close your eyes.
- I beg your pardon?
- Close our eyes?
- Oh, no, no, no.
- When I finish a job, nobody sees me leave.
- I forgot.
You're the wind.
- I'm either swallowed up by night or disappear in the mist.
It's my trademark.
Now, close your eyes.
- I'd rather close my ears.
- If you don't close your eyes, I'm not leaving.
- Bye.
- See ya.
- Okay.
-  -  The wind just broke its leg.
I've got it.
Third one from the left.
- She was wearing a big hat and carrying a parasol.
- What are you talking about?
I saw Colonel Flagg in Vegas when he was a showgirl.
I knew there was something wrong with her.
- What tipped you off, the beard?
- No, she was the only one carrying a machine gun.
##   - Checkmate.
- What?
Again?
What is it with you?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
All right, just to make it interesting, anybody can open with a pair of 10s but only if you're wearing civilian boxer shorts.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
You can't set a rule like that.
- No, it's dealer's choice, Major.
- Will you accept a civilian panty girdle?
- Tens and boxer shorts.
- That is the most absurd rule I've ever heard.
- Can anybody open?
- I'll open for 25 cents.
I told ya!
I told ya!
You owe me a buck and a half.
I'm out.
I blew everything last night on Radar's cockroach races.
He had the winner, but it come in riderless.
- Riderless?
- The fly fell off.
- I'm in.
B.J.?
- I'm in.
- Father, you wanna sit in the game?
- Huh?
Oh, yes.
Oh, I had the most extraordinary dream.
I was a cardinal in Rome, and the pope had a bad cold.
What do you suppose that means, Sidney?
You're the skull jockey.
Well, Freud said every dream is a wish.
One time my uncle dreamt he was dancing with a whale.
When he woke up, our cow had eaten his pants.
Do you wanna bet, or do you want Sidney to tell you what that means?
Oh, geez.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it meant anything.
-  You want a loan, Sidney?
- No, I think I'll write a letter.
- I've been putting it off.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
What do l How do I look?
- Cheerful.
I'm worried.
- All right.
What do you want?
- Two.
-  Who took my cards?
Oh.
- Here they are.
-  You?
-  Mm-hmm.
Two.
Dear Sigmund, I've been feeling somewhat frustrated lately and so I came to a kind of spa.
The waters are pretty good here.
And the inmates have an interesting defense against carnage.
- Too rich for me.
-  Insanity in the service ofhealth.
- Let me see your openers, Margaret.
- Here.
- I'm not talking about your cards.
- Never mind.
- Did you hear that?
- That's great.
Can you do a dog?
- Who deals?
-  One of them is particularly good at it.
- What am I holding the cards for?
- Name of Hawkeye.
Couple of weeks ago, he made rounds in post-op with a personality that had split two for one.
Good evening, ladies and germs.
I'm sorry I'm late, but my watch stopped.
It had to.
It's been running fast all week.
Is this the first time you've been pregnant?
How long have you had that throbbing in your wrist?
"Noyse!
Noyse"!
- Did you call me, Doctor?
- Why should I call you "Doctor"?
I'm the surgeon.
- Give him his medication.
Somebody's 15 minutes late.
- Right.
# Doo, dee-doo, dee-doo Whoop, dee-dee # - Well, your feet seem to be coming along just fine.
- It's my head, Doc.
Oh, yes.
For a minute there you had athlete's scalp.
Come on.
Give us a little smile.
Three bucks.
I swear to you.
These earrings go for 7.50 at the Tokyo P.X. Don't you think hoops are a little trashy before breakfast?
If I thought it'd get me out, I'd wear hula hoops in my ears.
2.50?
- I'll take 'em for 2.50.
- Sold.
I hope I win 'em back.
I don't want the holes in my lobes to close up again.
Klinger's an interesting case, Sigmund.
He's found more ways to go crazy than you ever dreamt of.
Sir.
Sir, there's been a terrible accident.
- What happened?
- He got hit with a chopper blade, sir.
If Klinger got hit by a chopper blade, he'd look like a malted milk.
It was slowing down.
Look what it did to his helmet.
How come it's got tire tracks on it?
- How's that?
- Ever since he came to, he only speaks in Arabic, sir.
Gee, what a strange thing.
- Smaha!
Smaha!
- What'd he say?
- He said, "Smaha!
Smaha"!
- Thank you.
Yeah!
It's not gonna work, Klinger.
Yeah!
- Looks like a relapse.
- His eyes have gone back in his head.
He looks like that every day right after breakfast.
- He's shaking!
- Private Habib Radar found me a can of smoked herring for breakfast and right now I'm deliriously happy cleaning my horse's toenails.
- Don't spoil it!
- Sir, I'm really scared.
-  - Klinger, wake up!
He's ranting, sir.
He wants his father's cheese from the windowsill.
You can have a piece of my herring, but you're not going home.
Well, thank you very much.
-  - Sophie, how about that Klinger?
Is he a pistol?
I guess what draws me to these people is that, faced with aggression in its most brutal form they've regressed to a state of antic, if not lunatic, pleasure.
There's been a rash of practical jokes lately.
Whoever the perpetrator is, he or she is becoming a folk hero.
-  -   Rank makes no difference.
No one is safe from the madjoker.
I'm sorr As you pointed out, Sigmund, there's a link between anger and wit.
Anger turned inward is depression.
Anger turned sideways is Hawkeye.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hiya, pal.
Hey, you got any way to get back to civilization from here?
If this isn't civilization, why am I standing in a bomb crater?
Thank you, buddy.
You lost from your unit, or are you trying to see the world on five dollars a day?
No, actually I jumped out of my airplane.
Such a nice day you thought you'd walk?
My engine was on fire.
But I managed to drop my load before I bailed out.
How lucky for you.
Come on.
I'll take a look at your leg.
- Are you a doctor?
- That's what they all think here.
Actually, I just like legs.
Is there a phone here?
I don't want my wife to worry when I don't show up at home tonight.
- You go home every night from the war?
- Only weekends.
Got a little place in Tokyo.
I tell ya.
For me, the war's been something that lasts about 30 minutes a day.
Then it's back to the base and dinner at the officers' club.
- It's only a war.
Why kill yourself?
- Yeah.
My gosh.
Will you look at those boots?
What a mess.
What have you been walkin' in, red clay?
- No, blood.
- That must be kind of rough on you guys, isn't it?
Well, I tell ya.
If I couldn't fly, I wouldn't touch this war.
You fly much?
I was shot out of a cannon once by the irate husband of a bearded lady.
It's beautiful up there.
At 20,000 feet, the sky is a brilliant blue.
You fly for a while in that stillness.
Then you take a reading, press a button, and drop your load.
You've never seen the people you've been bombing?
Nah.
Never.
I'm a really lucky guy.
- Flying so high with your head in the sky.
- Yeah.
I can't understand why you call this place the Swamp.
We were thinking of calling it the Latrine, but that name was taken.
- That's a private letter.
- Then why'd you leave it under your pillow?
Can I have that?
I want to erase anything nice I said about you guys.
Uh, Sidney, you're a psychiatrist.
Don't you think writing a letter to Sigmund Freud is a little crazy?
Who better than he would understand?
- Well, now that makes sense.
-  We couldn't help but notice that you came for the poker game and stayed for two weeks.
I just wanted a little vacation.
Sidney, Biarritz is a vacation.
The Swiss Alps is a vacation.
This is a fungus convention at Atlantic City.
There's something special about this place.
You give life here.
I'm running a little low on that right now.
- Would you like to talk about it?
- Well winter's the busy season for shrinks here.
The days get shorter.
The nights get colder.
I was getting 15 cases a week of total crack-ups.
Can I have some of that?
Business was too good.
I was losing people.
Sidney, we all lose patients.
Actually, the straw that broke my back was this one kid who heard voices telling him to kill himself.
I spent a lot of time with him.
One day he was very calm, relaxed.
Sometimes that's a signal they've made a decision.
Only somehow I missed it.
And that night, after I went to sleep that sweet, innocent, troubled kid listened to the voices.
After that, I started sleeping late.
I wasn't doing my work.
Well, well, well.
So the doctor can't cure himself, huh?
- God, I thought that lump under his blankets was dirty laundry.
- It is.
You can listen to their bleeding-heart gobbledygook all you want.
I say, if you want to keep your feet on the ground you gotta pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.
Why don't you pull yourself up by your own jockstrap?
It makes me no never mind.
I got all my cookies.
If there's a way to preserve your sanity in wartime, they've found it.
They slide their patched-up patients into the evac ambulance like loaves into a bread truck and yet they never forget those packages are people.
-  - Hey!
Hey, help!
Get a Get a medic!
Medic!
Come on, you guys!
-  -  Oh, no!
Get 'em out.
Be careful!
Look out for broken bones.
He hit the turn too fast and it rolled over.
Are these guys gonna be okay?
- Take a couple guys up front.
We'll work from back here.
- Bob.
Dennis.
Come up front.
- Get these men back into pre-op.
- This guy's in shock.
Start a glucose I.V.
This kid had one good arm.
Now it's broken.
Make sure those stitches aren't pulled.
Get the X-ray machine going.
- Who the hell did this?
Was O'Donnell drivin'?
- Yes, sir.
That klutz.
He isn't makin' any points for gettin' them there fast.
He's gotta get 'em there in one piece!
Tell O'Donnell I want to see him in my office.
And this time he can shake his can!
You got that?
He's dead, sir.
Nurse, I need you in pre-op.
Come on.
- Hathaway, grab the other end of this.
- I can get that.
No, I want him to do it.
- Can I give you a hand, Father?
- Yeah.
Get the other end.
Father Mulcahy fascinates me, Sigmund.
He's shy and studious, and yet he's got a left hook that could stop a truck.
And with absolutely no training, he seems to be a complete natural as a therapist.
- How are you doing, John?
- I didn't know what hit me.
I was on my stretcher, and then a second later, three guys are laying on top of me.
I used to wake up every morning like that when I was a boy.
I had to sleep with my brothers.
I'm not going back in that ambulance.
It's too dangerous.
And I'm not getting in any chopper.
Well, uh, all right.
We'll send you back on a nice, slow, safe ship.
You'll see your family in three or four months.
- Four months?
-  About that.
When's the next ambulance leave?
- In an hour or so.
- What's holding it up?
- Didn't I tell you to move that whole blood back there?
-  Move that blood or I'll make you drink it, you Transylvanian lunatic!
Margaret's an interesting woman.
On the outside, all discipline and strength and on the inside, six kinds of passion looking for an exit.
Major, word has gotten around that you're feeling kind of low.
Hard to keep a secret here in Macy's Window East, isn't it?
Well, everyone kind of keeps an eye on everybody else here.
You're not thinking of doing anything foolish?
Oh, no.
I mainly have this dull ache behind my nose and a feeling of listlessness.
Sort of a severe Geritol deficiency.
You ever get like that?
No, never.
I wouldn't permit it.
- How do you manage that?
- I just don't let it get to me.
The wounded don't get to you?
The cold?
The food?
The rats?
Major, I have three nurses down with dysentery.
I have a shortage of sulfa, surgical gowns and rubber gloves.
And I got a call from my fiance in Tokyo this morning who celebrated his birthday last night without me.
He must miss you very much.
No.
He said they had a very good time.
I see.
Am I upset?
Am I distressed?
No.
One has to be strong, Major.
In strength is serenity.
Well, I take my hat off to you, Margaret.
- Just a minute, Major.
What is that thing doing over there?
- I'm sorry.
What thing?
You let a woman sit down and have a drink with you with that thing there?
You mean the athletic supporter?
Major, you're a nurse.
It's disgusting!
Will you put something over it?
- Like a fig leaf?
- How dare you parade that thing in front of me.
Major, it isn't even mine.
It belongs to one of those repulsive, drunken, lecherous, evil cretins.
They live like pigs.
They have the morals of baboons.
- Will you please put your hat on it?
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
- My uniform is proud to serve.
I'm sorry you got upset.
- I'm not upset.
- Well, a little agitated.
Not at all.
It would be useless.
I wouldn't permit it.
- Right.
- And you can do it if I can.
I don't feel a thing.
I don't feel a thing.
Some people won't accept pain.
Theyjust refuse delivery.
That's pretty difficult here, because pain is such a basic ingredient to the MASH unit.
- What have you got there?
-  A couple of guys fell on him and pulled the stitches in his abdominal wall and peritoneum.
B.J.'s scrubbing up.
-  You had to go back in?
- She started bleeding again.
I guess I didn't get all the holes the first time.
Hey, she's just a little kid.
Eight years old.
I got a granddaughter back home who's about eight.
- What happened to her?
- Somebody dropped a bomb on her village from an airplane.
- Who did it?
- He just dropped it.
He didn't autograph it.
No, I mean was it one of theirs or one of ours?
- What difference does that make?
- A lot.
It makes a lot of difference.
Not to her.
- You brought me in there on purpose, didn't you?
- Yep.
You're a real S.O.B. You know that?
Look, you seem like a decent guy.
Too decent to think that this can be anything like a clean war.
From up there it is.
Was.
God, she's just a little baby.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
a long way to come down.
- It's coming nicely, Frank.
- Actually, it's one of several.
I don't intend getting caught more than six paces away from a good hole if somebody shouts "air raid".
- Prior planning.
- Prevents poor performance.
- Hmm.
Catchy.
- Yeah, well, I'm going home in one piece, brother.
- You sound determined.
- Let's just say I've been getting some signals from my wife back home.
- She needs a man there.
A whole man.
- Signals?
Yeah.
You know, hints.
- She's been going in for strange things.
- Like what?
She's not behaving like herself, and let's just leave it at that, okay?
- Okay.
- Oh, what the heck.
You're a psychiatrist.
I guess you've heard it all, huh?
Well, I thought I'd heard it all.
She got together with some of her lady friends and they went on a trip to Indianapolis for no reason.
- For no reason?
- Just to look around.
It cost $55.
And she's getting mixed up in politics stuffing envelopes for the Republican Club and maybe even, uh ringing doorbells.
It sounds as though she's stepping out on her own a little.
- That's what I think.
- People grow, Frank.
- When I go home, I want the same girl I married.
- Right.
Well, she's changing.
She's becoming sexy and provocative and I got a letter today with a picture of her in slacks walking away from the camera.
Frank, maybe she's just trying to find out who she is.
That doesn't mean she's leaving you.
You bet she isn't, bub.
I happen to believe in the sanctity of marriage no matter how ugly or disgusting it gets.
I'll kill her before I divorce her.
I'm not suggesting either.
Oh, no of course you're not.
I should have known better than to tell something personal to a psychiatrist.
Actually, Sigmund, it's a wonder more people here don't take a vacation from reality.
Don't take a vacation from reality.
Some people even manage to grow.
- Radar, for instance.
- Come on!
Come on!
In many ways, he's still as innocent and naive as the local orphans he plays with.
And yet this boy keeps this unit this state of chaos running smoothly.
Uh, sir, I have some papers for you to sign before you go to bed.
Just in time, Radar.
I was just saying good night to Mrs. Potter.
Say good night for me too, sir.
- Unless she's in her nightgown or something.
-  I'll ignore that.
Uh, sir, here's the mess requisition.
- I ordered 500 hams.
- Isn't that kind of a lot?
Well, Sergeant Skinowsky from over the 309th says he'll trade me ice cream and fruit for ham.
I figured it might be a good idea to order a few extra.
Good boy, Radar.
I haven't had fruit for so long, my colon will think it's a stickup.
That's a good one, sir.
- This is the updated patients list.
- Right.
- What's in the box?
- Um, it's the ambulance driver's personal effects, sir.
It's going out to Graves Registration.
- Did you write a little note for me to his folks?
- Yes, sir.
It's right here.
I never know what to say.
Of all the lousy duties I've had to perform in this service that's always been the lousiest.
You can change it if you want, sir.
I'm not sure all the words are exactly right or anything.
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. O'Donnell "It is with real deep sadness that I must tell you of the death of your son.
"You can be very, very proud of Jerry.
"He never took a human life, and he died "while he was trying to save the lives of five other fellows.
"He was rushing them to the evac "which is short for evacuation hospital, in Seoul "when his ambulance overturned.
"He was a real good boy, Mr. And Mrs. O'Donnell "and I know he loved you both very much.
"He spoke of you often to my company clerk, Corporal Walter O'Reilly.
"We were proud of him at MASH and we'll miss Jerry very, very much".
- Thank you, Radar.
Don't change a word.
- Thank you, sir.
The one person I can't figure out, even with all you've taught me, Sigmund is B.J. Hunnicutt.
- He's an enigma with size- 13 shoes.
- Get that guy to pre-op now.
In the midst of the most terrific enterprise ever devised to separate a person's brains from his buns B.J. Goes calmly on.
I envy his serenity.
- Although there must be a volcano under there somewhere.
- Oh, give me that.
-  -   - Oh, hi.
- You!
You're the practical joker?
It certainly looks that way, doesn't it?
- Would you like to help?
- Sure.
What do I do?
As loud as you can, shout, "Air raid"!
Air raid!
Air raid!
Air raid!
Air raid!
Air raid!
Air raid!
"Colonel Potter is pleased to announce that today is the first day of spring.
"In recognition of this event "we are unveiling the cherry tree branch "that we have been trying to grow in a hothouse kind of "ever since Major Houlihan got the branch for us when she went away to get engaged to Tokyo.
" Oh, thank you.
"And now, in honor of the first day of spring" Okay, that's it.
- You leaving, Sidney?
- Afraid so.
- Hate to be cured and run.
- You feel better?
Yeah, I think I do a little.
It's like spring at MASH.
If you can't find it, and you can't feel it, you just go ahead and make it.
Somewhere in here, I'm coaxing a little bud to grow.
- Meanwhile, I'm goin' back to work.
- See ya at the game next week?
Yes, I'll be here with $20 in my pants and three aces up my sleeve.
Show a little imagination.
Don't make them all spades.
Clamp.
They look every day into the face of death.
- I'll be closing in five minutes.
- On the surface they may seem like other doctors and nurses but underneath Ah, Sigmund, underneath.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Suture.
Clamp.
Suture.
- Sponge.
-  Frank, as long as we have to work together - I don't see why we can't be friends.
- Friends?
Don't you dare mention the word "friend" to me, you you nurse.
Scissors.
- Ow!
- Hmm.
Hey, you two, these public displays of affection have got to stop.
-  -  I've seen it happen before.
Married men go all to pieces when their girlfriends get engaged.
- Cut.
- It's not losing a girlfriend.
- He's afraid of getting his own wife back.
-  Look at this foot kid's quite a marksman, isn't he?
Don't let Frank hear you say that.
If he finds out this kid shot himself he'll form a posse and have him lynched.
Yeah.
Suture.
Wonder why they always go for the foot.
Why didn't he try shooting himself in the canteen?
Yeah, then they could win the Purple Tush.
- Close for me.
- Blow it out your ear.
All right, where did you hide the Band-Aids?
Band-Aids?
You're working on an abdominal wound the size of the Grand Canyon.
It's for me, you simp.
She pinched my pinkie with her scissors.
She was getting even.
You pinched her plenty of times.
- Tit for tat.
- Yeah, what's that?
That?
In medical parlance, we call that a foot.
- See?
It's a matched set.
- You know what I mean.
I happen to be an expert on foot wounds, and that looks fishy to me.
- I think he has a fish fetish.
- This man shot himself.
- No, no, no, no.
That's not what happened.
- No?
See, this is Danny Fitzsimons, the star placekicker from Fordham.
Now, what happened is, an enemy soldier shot at him from very close range.
And instinctively, Danny tried to kick the bullet out of the way.
- It's true.
- You're kidding!
- No.
- Well, what about the enemy soldier?
- Ten-yard penalty.
- For roughing the kicker.
Twerps.
There's an incoming chopper, sirs.
Two wounded.
- Radar, get him into post-op.
- Then go find Father Mulcahy.
He oughta have a little talk with our football hero.
Yes, sir.
- Corporal?
- Yes, sir.
Does Fordham have a football team?
- I don't know, sir.
I've been in post-op all morning.
- Oh.
Take care of my pal first.
He's much worse.
- We're gonna take care of everybody.
- Please go check on him.
- He saved my life.
- Lift him out.
- Notice anything unusual about this guy?
- He's out of uniform.
- He's wearing a fur coat.
- I'm glad he's conscious.
I'd hate to have to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
- How is he?
- He's fine.
He just asked me how you bust out of this chicken outfit.
Come in.
Um, Father Oh, I'm sorry, Father.
No.
Oh, what is it, Radar?
Oh, Father, Captain Pierce wants you in the O.R. Right away.
- He says he has someone he wants you to talk to.
- Well, certainly.
- It's not for the last rites, is it?
- Oh, no, sir.
- Thank heaven.
- Oh, uh, Father excuse me, would you happen to know if Fordham has a football team?
A darn good one.
They don't call them the Rams for nothing.
I knew a priest would know.
He tried to warn me about the mine, but I wasn't paying attention.
So he tripped it saved my life.
I think he's gonna be all right.
It's mostly the leg, especially the paw.
Captain, I don't mean to seem unsympathetic, but that dog really shouldn't be in here.
- Think of the germs.
- You have more germs than that dog, Nurse.
- I beg your pardon!
- I rise in defense of the lady.
- She showers frequently.
I know because I watch her.
- Pervert.
I just meant that dogs don't have as many germs as humans.
- Forget it.
- Hawkeye?
There's someone you want me to talk to?
Yeah.
I got kind of an unusual case for you, Father.
Oh, my!
What denomination is he?
He's a German shepherd.
I guess that makes him a Lutheran.
Oh, gee.
What happened, fella?
It's not the dog, Father.
It's Private Fitzsimons in post-op.
- What's the trouble?
- Why don't you just go have a talk with him, okay?
Certainly.
- Oh, Frank, um - Huh?
I got a case over here.
It's a little over my head.
It's another foot wound.
Since you're the expert, why don't you take it?
Of course.
You understand that it's not necessarily because I'm a better surgeon than you.
- It's just that, uh, I know my feet.
- I know.
Uh, listen.
L-I, um, I think I oughta warn you that this definitely is self-inflicted.
- You're sure?
- Positive.
He tripped a land mine on purpose.
We have a witness.
Well, I'm here as a doctor.
I mean, first we'll get him healthy again, then, uh, court-martial him.
And if all goes well, put him in front of a firing squad.
- Where is he?
- Right over here.
- That's a dog!
- Very good, Frank.
- I knew he'd get it.
- I'm not operating on any damn dog.
Oh, come on, sir.
You've got to.
After all, dogs are people too.
Well, I'm not going to do it.
Especially because that's a self-inflicted wound.
- He did it to save my life.
- Well, that's what he says now.
Look.
He might be a dog, but he also happens to be a corporal in the United States Army.
See, these two were scheduled to be rotated back to the States any day now.
And it wouldn't look very good, Frank, if if, uh What's his name?
- Cupcake.
- Really?
If Corporal Cupcake never made it back to the States because you wouldn't operate on him.
- Don't forget.
He's a hero.
- He's scheduled to be awarded the Silver Fire Hydrant.
Well I better scrub.
You're gonna be okay, boy.
An altar boy, my.
Where you from?
Philadelphia.
Saint Isadore's Parish.
Philadelphia!
I was in the seminary there.
- You must know Father Marty Gallagher.
- Sure do.
He's my pastor.
Oh, I studied with him.
Oh, what a man.
- We used to call him "Boom Boom" Gallagher.
- So did we.
- Father, do you know how he got his name Boom Boom?
- No, I don't.
He was a chaplain in World War II.
He was always way up at the front.
He was so close to the artillery that when he finished a sermon, the enemy would say "Amen".
Yes, he used to tell us stories about the war.
But I have to admit, I don't find war quite as exciting as he did.
- Neither do I. - You know, Father Gallagher would be proud of you right now.
- I don't think so.
- Oh, why wouldn't he be?
Because I shot myself in the foot to get outta here.
Oh, my goodness.
Danny, how old are you?
Eighteen and a half.
Well, you're young.
You're far from home.
You made a mistake.
But we all do foolish things.
It wasn't foolish.
I'd do it again in a minute.
You can't mean that.
Father, you sit around with your butt in the mud for weeks watching snipers pick off your buddies one by one.
They sneak up at night in canvas shoes, so you can't hear them.
One night, I was in a foxhole with four other guys.
I snuck out to go to the latrine, and when I got back all four of them were dead.
I couldn't take it anymore.
Danny, I'm sure it's rough out there.
L-I imagine it's very difficult, but You imagine?
Father, haven't you ever been up there?
- No.
- Not even once?
You've never been up there?
Not even for a little while?
Well I've wanted to go but I'm not allowed.
Boy, if Boom Boom could see us now.
He'd wonder where he went wrong.
Well, let's not talk about Boom Boom.
Let's talk about you.
Tell me about it.
I know it's rough.
Father, with all due respect, we don't have anything to talk about.
Let's face it.
You have no idea what it's like up there.
Whoops!
Missed again.
I have the same trouble myself, sir.
Well, at least my cheeks won't be bloodshot.
If these drops of yours work, I'll get you a field promotion.
Sir, I know we've talked about this before but I want you to understand how useless I feel here.
Why, the men don't need my words of comfort when they're safe and being taken care of.
They need comfort up there, where they're wet and cold and facing bullets.
Father, you've got the toughest job in camp and there's not much glory in it like there is for the surgeons and the nurses.
But you're the one who really holds things together.
You should be proud.
Colonel, I had a seminary teacher who was a chaplain in World War II.
- Father Marty Gallagher.
- Boom Boom Gallagher?
- Oh, why, you knew him?
- No.
Heard about him.
He was famous for the poker games he used to organize whenever the German artillery took a break.
Colonel, Boom Boom used to excite us with his stories about being right up front with the men, and that's where I wanna be.
Father, this is a different war.
Line officers don't want chaplains up at the front.
It's just another unarmed man they have to be responsible for.
Whoops!
Got the ear that time.
Yeah, right.
We don't have any choppers, and you don't have any ambulances.
Now if we could just run out of wounded soldiers, we wouldn't have to be in business at all.
All right.
Look, I'll send a litter jeep right up there, okay?
All right.
Yeah, okay.
-  Radar.
- Yeah.
They got a guy up at the aid station who needs surgery.
Do you think you and Igor could grab a jeep and go get him?
Go up to the aid station where all the shooting is?
- A man's life depends on it.
- Well, I know.
But I got all this work here.
Colonel Potter expects me to - Okay.
I'll do it.
- Okay.
Thanks.
I gotta go back to O.R.  Hey, how's the dog doing Corporal Cupcake?
Oh, he's gonna be fine.
He's got a pleasant little snarl on his face.
You don't belong up there.
You belong right here.
We need you.
Sir?
Oh, pardon me.
- Uh, what is it, Radar?
- Uh, sir there's someone badly wounded up at the aid station.
Your permission for Igor and me to go get him?
All right, Radar, go ahead.
But be careful.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry I interrupted your service, Father.
-  Hmm?
You're doing a fine job, but try to understand.
You're a chaplain, not a soldier.
Well, I think I'm a soldier too, sir.
I certainly look like one.
I once saw a picture of Calvin Coolidge in a war bonnet but that didn't make him an Indian.
- Sorry, Father.
- Yes, sir.
Father.
Father Mulcahy, is anything wrong?
You have a very determined look on your face.
Do I?
Well, I don't mean to.
- Is there something I can do for you?
- No.
No.
I guess I'll have to do for myself.
Thank you.
Sure.
Come on, Igor.
We gotta get rolling.
Igor, you stay here.
I'll go with Radar.
Uh, Father, you gotta get permission.
I only got orders for Igor and me.
I'll be responsible, Radar.
There's a wounded man, and he needs a priest.
- Here.
Take my helmet.
- Father, you're gonna get both of us in trouble.
- Radar, you play poker, right?
- Not now, Father.
No, no, no, no.
A very wise priest once said "No matter how well you bluff, eventually you have to put your cards on the table".
- I can't argue with that -  'Cause I don't know what you're talking about.
- Okay, take it away.
-  Easy now.
That's good.
Okay.
- Yeah, just sign here.
- Yeah.
You guys are lifesavers.
I don't know how long he'd last without surgery.
That's a bad chest wound.
No use, Padre.
Every once in a while the Chinese let us know that they invented gunpowder.
How in heaven's name do you ever get used to it?
You get used to never getting used to it.
I wish he were conscious.
I'd like to offer some comfort.
Being unconscious is as comfortable as you can get up here, Padre.
Do you ever get any wounded dogs up here?
Nah.
They're too smart to get wounded.
They just point out where the Chinese are, and they step aside.
- They're kinda like generals.
- Radar, we'd better get underway.
- This man needs attention.
- Right.
- Well, wait a minute.
- What?
We had a goat up here once though.
Very serious shrapnel wounds.
Oh, wow.
What'd you do?
We ate 'im.
- How's he doing, Father?
- He seems okay.
Radar, I want to thank you for bringing me along on this.
I really needed the experience.
That's okay, Father.
Sometimes it's more important to be nice to people than to worry about the rules, you know.
Geez, I remember once in school, we were having this test, you know and there was this boy, Leonard Gerst.
- He wanted to, you know, copy off of me.
- Ah.
And I knew his mother would beat him up, uh, if he flunked the test - so I let him copy.
- That was a very nice thing to do, Radar.
- Also, he gave me three dollars.
-  I'll have a cafe espresso.
And for my friend here, a cappuccino deluxe.
- Help yourself.
- Ah.
We also have a special today on roast crown of lamb with cranberry stuffing served with a side order of fresh poached salmon and dill sauce.
No, thanks.
I had that for breakfast.
This is terrible, even by my standards.
And this from a man who drinks lime Kool-Aid with strips of bologna in it.
Klinger, have you seen Father Mulcahy?
No, sir, I haven't seen him all day.
But if it's a spiritual problem give me a minute, and I'll come back as a nun.
Careful, Klinger.
Dressing as a nun can be habit-forming.
It isn't a spiritual problem.
It's physical - a hole in a foot.
- Spare me.
Some guys shoot themselves in the foot to get sent back home.
Not me.
I'd ruin a perfectly good pair of nylons.
Say, Pierce Butt out.
I checked on that Fitzsimons kid and he couldn't have played football for Fordham he's only 18.
He entered when he was 16, Frank.
Got lucky.
- He went there on a bingo scholarship.
- Oh, those Catholics.
- How's Corporal Cupcake?
-  Who?
The pooch.
Woof!
Woof!
Oh, him.
Resting comfortably.
He'll be back on his paws in no time.
What a humiliating experience.
No surgeon with an ounce of self-respect would operate on a dog.
Frank, some vets earn more money than doctors.
- Oh?
- Sure.
Better get his address.
- Put him on my Christmas card list.
- Couldn't hurt.
Oh!
You know, you really don't get used to it.
- Radar!
Radar, pull over!
- Huh?
Stop the jeep.
He's choking.
There's something wrong!
Oh, God, pull over!
I am.
Wait a minute!
- What's the matter?
- Help me.
- Help me to clear his throat.
- Ooh!
-  - It isn't working.
Well, maybe there's something stuck down there, Father.
-  - His tongue is swollen.
It's blocking the passage.
Oh, he's not breathing!
He's not breathing at all!
Radar, call the base.
Get one of the doctors.
Right.
Hi.
This is the litter jeep, MASH 407 Litter jeep calling MASH 4077!
Come in!
Come in, anybody!
I'm not just anybody, but I'll talk.
What is it, Radar?
Uh, Klinger, it's Radar.
Listen, we're in trouble here.
Get me a doctor, real quick.
Gotcha!
Captain Pierce, Hunnicutt, Colonel Potter, an emergency!
- What?
- The radio, sir.
It's Radar.
- Put it on the speaker.
- What's the problem, Radar?
The guy we're bringing back can't breathe.
Father Mulcahy says his tongue is swollen up.
- What's Mulcahy doing there?
- This is Father Mulcahy.
I know I'm not supposed to be here, but we've got a man in bad trouble.
- He needs help!
- Father, where's the man wounded?
Well, in the chest, Hawkeye, but I don't think that's the trouble.
His tongue is swollen, and he can't breathe.
- Is he getting any air at all?
- No, sir.
Not much.
- Hardly any at all.
- Tracheotomy.
- Right.
- Father, Radar, listen carefully.
You only have a couple of minutes.
One of you is gonna have to cut a small hole in the man's throat to let air in.
- You mean, cut like a doctor?
- We'll give you step-by-step instructions.
I'm no good at step-by-step.
You do it.
- Hawkeye, do you think we can?
- If you don't, the man's dead!
- Oh, very well.
We're ready.
-  All right, Father, here we go.
First you need something to cut with a sharp knife.
- Sharp knife.
- You have a first-aid kit.
See if there's anything sharp in there you can use.
-  - Uh, let's see.
Geez, there's nothing in here but these funny little scissors they gave us in kindergarten.
Why can't they keep these things complete?
- Don't you have anything else?
- I've got my Tom Mix pocketknife.
- Tom Mix pocketknife.
- Your what?
Tom Mix was an old radio show.
It's very sharp.
Okay, fine.
That's fine.
Look.
You need a small tube.
When you make the hole you're gonna put the tube in, and the man will breathe through that.
- A tube?
- Part of a syringe will do if there's one in the kit.
You could use the top of a fountain pen.
Just snip off one end.
- Is a pencil okay?
- No, it has to be something hollow.
Think!
- Wait!
Wait!
My bottle of eyedrops.
- Eyedrops!
The dropper is plastic.
I'll just pull the cap off.
Okay, that's kinda small, but that'll do.
Now, look, Father, you're gonna have to work fast.
In the first-aid kit, get the alcohol.
Sterilize the knife and the man's neck.
Where's the alcohol?
Where's the alcohol?
Oh, okay, okay.
We're doing it.
Okay.
Father, if you're ready Iook for a notch at the base of his throat.
It's right where the chest starts.
Right in the middle.
- Oh, boy!
- I got it!
Good.
Now take the knife and make an incision a vertical incision through the skin about two inches long.
There's gonna be a little blood, but that's okay.
- Oh!
Oh, sure.
Okay.
-  Oh!
Oh, ick!
He did it!
He did it!
Good, Father.
Very good.
Okay, now open that skin with your fingers and keep cutting until you see a couple of little horizontal rings of tissue.
- I got it.
- He got it.
Okay, now this is it, Father.
That tissue is fibrous.
It's not going to be easy to cut.
Make an incision between the rings of tissue and then stick the tube in the hole you made.
The man will be breathing through that tube.
Now work fast!
- I have to say a prayer first.
- He's gotta say a prayer first.
Make it a damn short one.
- I can't think of any.
- Oh, my God.
Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty - through Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
- That's grace!
Don't pay any attention to the blood.
Just get the tube in there.
He's breathing!
You hear that?
He's breathing!
He did it!
Tape the tube in place and pack some cotton around it to stop the bleeding.
- You did it!
- Oh, the skin and the tissue seem to close right in around the tube.
Father, that's exactly what's supposed to happen!
You did it!
You did it!
- Amen.
- Amen.
Good work, Padre.
Get that man back here as fast as you can.
We did it.
Oh, boy, we did it.
- Well, what do you think of that?
- I think I'm a fool.
- What do you mean?
- I came all the way over to Korea to perform surgery.
I could have stayed at home and phoned it in.
- Come on.
I think I'd better drive.
- Okay.
- Radar, you all right?
- Oh, yeah.
Sure.
I'm just a little carsick.
- What happened to the wheel?
-  Oh!
Father, let's get outta here!
Very well, Radar.
If you insist.
- ## - You know, Father, I thought we had a deal.
We save the bodies.
You save the souls.
Oh, my.
Well, I hope I didn't violate any union regulations.
- Father.
- Hey, Father.
Thought you'd like to know your patient is doing just fine.
We're all thinking of trading in our scalpels for Tom Mix pocketknives.
Padre, I could swear I told you not to go up to the front.
Yes, sir.
You did, sir.
And in spite of the fact that I saved a man's life I now feel I was wrong to disobey you.
Cleverly put.
Boom Boom Gallagher would be proud of you.
Oh what a nice thought.
You know, Father, first time I operated, I was scared stiff.
And there weren't any bombs going off around me either.
I can imagine what it was like for you.
- No, Hawkeye, you can't.
- Why not?
You had to be there.
- Hello, Danny.
- Hello, Father.
I understand you had quite an afternoon.
Oh, you heard, did you?
Yeah.
Everybody's talking about it.
You actually cut a hole in a guy's throat.
And under fire too.
Were you scared?
Terrified.
You know, l-I think it gave me a little taste of what it was like for you.
Danny, maybe it almost gives me the right to talk to you.
- What do you think?
- Let's talk, Father.
Yes.
Why don't we?
Seoul is a very big city, and there are certain females you gotta watch out for.
Sir, you don't have to warn me about stuff like that.
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to him.
So long, Corporal Cupcake.
It's been a pleasure serving with you.
Well, taking off, huh?
Bye, pooch.
-  - Oh, nice!
If it weren't for me, you'd be in a wheelchair.
- Go ahead, Phil.
-  You know what's funny?
When Cupcake gets his promotion I'm gonna be outranked by a dog.
I know how you feel.
I'm only a captain, and Frank is a major.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Go, go, go, go, go!
How many times have I told you?
Deliveries in the rear.
We overran a North Korean aid station.
We got some of ours and some of theirs.
- They brought in Commies?
- This bus will pick up anybody.
I didn't come to Korea to treat the enemy.
I'm sure they'll be glad to hear that, Frank.
- O.R. Stat.
Prep him.
- Litter!
Rest in peace.
Now, this one can wait.
Well, what do we got here?
A wounded Commie officer, huh?
Please.
Take a look at that man across the way.
What, you giving me instructions?
He has an intra-abdominal bleed.
Probably a ruptured spleen.
Listen, wise guy, I'm the doctor here.
He's delirious.
Last week, he thought he was a fire chief.
You wanna hear a hot one?
This pinko here is trying to teach me medicine.
- Tell him he's wasting his time.
- You keep your trap shut, Commie!
- You're in enough trouble as it is.
- Please, Doctor!
That man has internal bleeding.
He needs surgery immediately.
- Radar!
- Sir.
Get this man into pre-op.
He's number one on the hit parade.
- Right.
Roy!
- For criminy sakes, why do you listen to him when you won't listen to one of your own kind?
Oh, nerts to you.
Don't tell me.
Let me guess you're a doctor, right?
And that man he has a crushed femoral artery.
- You'll have to take the leg.
- I looked at him.
He's on his way.
He's terrified he will be killed.
Tell him not to worry, Doctor.
Your patients are ours now.
But I warn you, we don't split fees.
- You know, I've been very worried about you, Margaret.
- Really?
- You know, your fiance what's his name, uh, Ronald?
- Donald.
- Right.
- Right.
You know, maybe you're naive and don't see that there are deceitful people in this world.
I've been doing a lot of thinking about this in my tent - alone at night.
- Right, Frank.
No, really.
He just might be stringing you along.
- He gave me a ring.
- Well, big deal.
- Oh!
- He could be married, you know, and didn't tell you.
- Remember how our relationship started?
- Right.
- Well, this guy should be eternally grateful.
- And internally grateful.
Okay, Kellye, you can close now.
Believe me, Major, I wouldn't operate on this commie if Potter didn't make me.
- It really burns my butt.
- Mine too.
You're not the only real American here, Frank.
I know, I know.
I included your butt right along with mine.
You watch that mouth, or I'll tell Donald.
"I'll tell Donald.
I'll tell Donald".
Excuse me.
Could we get on with it?
- Oh, shut up!
- Have you been eavesdropping on our conversation?
- I have tried not to.
-  Listen, bub if you come out of this, you'd better not repeat a word of what you've heard.
- I promise.
- I'm so upset, Margaret.
Look at my hand shaking.
Relax.
You'll feel better after the operation.
- How's it going, Frank?
- We're just about to operate on your Commie friend.
Oh?
I thought it was a rehearsal for The Bickersons.
- All right, Margaret, let's get this over with.
- Doctor No.
Wait!
- Doctor, could I ask a favor?
- Want me to put a nickel in the parking meter?
Would it be possible for you to operate on me?
I don't think the major's heart is in it.
Look, I didn't ask for this job.
If you wanna take over, Pierce, just say the word.
- Please.
- On one condition.
Do you have Blue Cross?
Okay, Frank, I got him.
You can have him.
I'd rather get some sleep.
- Gloves, please.
- Thank you, Doctor.
You know, when I got a haircut in the States I always waited for the head barber.
Ah, it was worth it.
How do you like it short on the top, thick on the sides?
- Margaret?
- Ready, Doctor.
While I'm cutting, you give him a manicure.
-  - Nurse.
Nurse.
- Nurse!
-   What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Stop that!
- Able!
Stop that!
Let him alone!
- But he was choking!
-  - O'Reilly!
Corporal O'Reilly!
- Major Burns?
-  What is it?
- Sir, Major Houlihan wants you.
- Margaret?
Yes, sir.
She says she needs you right away, badly.
I knew she'd come to her senses.
Where is she?
- Post-op.
- Post-op?
Is she crazy?
Somebody will see us.
- Hawkeye?
- I said I'd take you home, but it isn't light yet.
- Hawkeye, wake up.
- Radar, do me a favor, will you?
Drive this lady home.
My keys are in my sport coat.
- Hawkeye!
-  Radar!
If you insist on making noise, will you please be quiet about it?
Hey, listen!
Wake up.
It's that North Korean.
Major Houlihan says he tried to kill some guy.
And you woke me up just for that?
This ought to keep him in his place.
- What are you doing, Frank?
- Strapping this heathen down.
- He tried to kill that patient.
- Tried to kill him?
He was pulling out his trach tube.
That's the way these yellow devils think.
It's burned into their brains.
Kill Americans.
Kill!
Kill!
They don't respect human life the way we do.
I'd like to take him out and shoot him.
- Brilliant.
- What happened?
His tube was clogged.
He couldn't breathe, so I tried to clear it.
Nurse, clear that trach tube.
Don't unleash him.
He's a killer.
- He was trying to help the guy.
- Why should he help one of our men?
- I wouldn't help one of theirs.
- I think we should tell Colonel Potter.
- I dare you.
- I double dare you.
Nobody double dares me and gets away with it.
Don't worry about them.
They don't seem as bad as they really are.
What will happen to me, Captain?
After you've recovered, they'll send you to a P.O.W. Camp.
- You'll treat other prisoners.
- Worms, foot fungus, diarrhea.
- Real challenge for a doctor.
- Worse.
I'm a surgeon.
University of Chicago.
I wondered where you got that Midwestern accent.
- I interned at Cooks County Hospital.
- Pretty good training.
- Evenin', boys.
- Klinger.
You know, I've been in combat for almost three years but that still strikes me as a very ugly woman.
You ought to see her naked.
Then we'd really have to strap you down.
If you want to know what I think, I think he's a spy.
Good point, Margaret.
That makes a lot of sense.
Sure.
He shot himself in the thigh just to get in here, huh?
Well, why not?
They're diabolical.
Forgive me, Colonel, but you don't understand the Oriental mind the way I do.
I'll buy that.
What information could he get in here?
- How many Q-Tips we've got?
How many suppositories?
- Right.
Why am I wasting time like this when I could be sawing wood?
Let me put it this way, Burns, Houlihan.
- Colonel?
- Yes, sir?
Dismissed!
You saved the leg.
- How is that possible?
- New procedure.
We took a section of the saphenous vein, reversed it and grafted it into the femoral artery.
So you can do that now.
I knew they were working on such a thing.
- It was perfected by an Italian macaroni expert.
- Remarkable.
You're so far ahead of us in many ways.
We even developed the banana daiquiri.
You know, I wish the circumstances were different and we could be working together.
- You'd be willing to do that?
- You treat the enemy.
Why can't I?
- Radar, you look pensive.
- No, sir.
I'm just thinking.
- You seem to be picking at your food.
- Just cautious.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm.
Radar, you're a remarkable person.
Naive, yet wise.
Gentle, but strong.
No more nurses' shower pictures.
My camera's rusty.
Don't be so suspicious.
I just wanna ask you a question.
Oh, no.
Here it comes.
Suppose there was a doctor who wanted to join this outfit.
Oh, heck.
That's easy.
All he'd have to do is, uh get in touch with "l" Corps and request a transfer.
Problem.
This doctor is from the other side.
- Other side of what?
- Other side of the war.
- You mean he's from Supply?
- No, Radar.
He's North Korean.
You guys are kidding, right?
Hey, that's a real problem.
"I" Corps disapproves of the enemy.
It's not impossible, is it?
I mean, you've got low friends in high places.
- Be persuasive.
- Be charming.
- Use force.
- No.
I couldn't do that.
Beej, the, uh, the nurses' annual physical is coming up soon, isn't it?
- Mm-hmm, and we're gonna need an assistant.
- Oh, yeah.
Is that the, uh, complete physical, same as last year?
-  It's better.
- Mmm.
We're gonna need a set of orders, I.D., dog tags and a uniform.
With all that stuff, you could transfer Flash Gordon to the outfit.
- We don't want him.
Bleaches his hair.
- Listen, um Sparky could really help us on this, but he's gonna want something.
- Something really good.
- We already anticipated that.
How would Sparky like a solid gold Chinese watch taken directly from the wrist of an enemy officer?
- With his permission, may I add.
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
It's very nice, but he'd never be able to read the time.
It's got Chinese numbers on it.
- It comes with an instruction book.
- The symbol at the top is a 12.
The one at the bottom is a six.
- They stole that from us.
- We stole waffles from them.
- I thought that was "psgetti".
- Come on.
Come on.
Will Sparky do it?
Well, uh, for this watch, I think he would probably transfer his own mother.
Have a safe journey.
Good luck and God be with you.
- Thank you.
- Aw, knock it off and get on the bus.
Frank has trouble saying good-bye.
- You better move along if you want a window seat.
- Yes.
Brokenhearted, Pierce, about losing your good North Korean buddy?
No.
I was getting kinda tired of the guy.
He beat me out of eight bucks in Chinese checkers.
Let's bring these men up here and get 'em loaded.
- Come on.
-   "Captain Cho Wunho, board certified, Chicago, 1949".
- Welcome aboard, Captain.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Radar, this is the first time "l" Corps has sent us help without us screaming about it.
Oh, yes, sir.
That's right.
You know how it is.
Sometimes when you don't yell and holler the loudest, they hear you the most.
Well put.
Can you find quarters for the new doctor, Radar?
Um, your permission to move him into the Swamp, sir?
Oh.
Okay.
But prepare yourself, Captain.
At first, your roommates may appear a bit crazy.
But later on, you'll find out they're only lunatics.
I'm accustomed to living with Americans, Colonel.
Colonel?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.
No.
Come in, Major.
I'd like you to meet our new doctor.
- Oh.
- Major Houlihan, Captain Cho Wunho.
- Haven't we met before?
- I was thinking the same thing.
There's a little gin mill in Seoul the Pink Pagoda.
- Didn't we tango?
- Certainly not.
I mean, I've never been there.
- I must be mistaken.
- Perhaps I am also.
Uh, why don't you take the doctor to his quarters, Radar.
Oh, right away, sir.
Sir.
Oh, Captain?
You'll go on duty at 1800 hours.
Will somebody please call me?
I recently lost my watch.
Uh, that will be no problem, sir.
I'll-I'll call you.
I swear I know that man, and I don't tango.
Maybe it was the cha-cha-cha.
I'm kidding.
-  You wanna sponge that, Frank?
-  Okay, okay!
Why do we need another doctor all of a sudden?
We've been short a doctor here since the day you showed up.
I'm as good a doctor as the next man.
Provided the next man is Lou Costello.
You know, Major Houlihan and I think there's something fishy about this Dr. Cho.
You'd think there was something fishy about Albert Schweitzer.
There is.
If he were a good doctor, he'd be in Beverly Hills helping the wealthy.
Sponges, please.
More sponges.
Frank, I can't see.
You're standing in my light.
Colonel, do you wanna take a look at what he's doing?
Frank, come on, will you!
Clamp.
I've never seen a heminephrectomy done like that, Doctor.
- Where'd you pick that up?
- Professor Goodson in Chicago, sir.
Ah.
Read about it.
Never seen it.
Beautiful work.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Mmm.
Well, carry on.
Halt!
What's your business, gentlemen?
- You are a nurse?
- No.
I'm Corporal Klinger.
I don't like to brag, but I made this outfit myself.
What do you think?
Most becoming.
We are from the KATUSA hospital at Kumgang.
You have these supplies?
"Plasma, penicillin, morphine, achromycin".
Sounds like you're opening a drugstore.
- What's goin' on here, Klinger?
- Oh, Major Burns, sir these men are from the hospital at Kumgang.
- They need supplies.
- Forget it.
We're not here to hand out supplies to every Tom, Dick and Kwang.
- I'll check with Colonel Potter.
- Don't bother Potter.
I can say no all by myself.
No!
But we must have these supplies.
Pardon me, Major, but what is your name, please?
Frank Burns.
What's it to you?
We have heard of a great doctor called Frank Burns.
- Could you be him?
- Of course.
We have heard that he never turns down people in need that he is as generous as he is skilled.
Yeah, well, I'm, uh, sort of the Albert Schweitzer of Korea, you know.
What an honor it is to meet you.
Oh.
Well, what are you guys standing around for?
- Get these people what they need and hurry up.
- Right away, sir!
Excuse me.
You're getting supplies for those men?
- Yes, sir.
It's Major Burns's orders, sir.
- They are imposters, you know?
What?
Who, sir?
The men in the jeep.
It is common practice to change uniforms and get supplies from the units like these.
- You mean they're the enemy?
- Yes.
Be careful of them.
- Hey, I gotta tell Colonel Potter.
- No.
They are desperate and heavily armed.
- W-Well, what should we do?
- The easiest way is to give them what they want.
Then they will go, peacefully.
- Promise me something, Radar.
- Yeah?
If anything happens, bury me in the blue chiffon.
You sure you fellas won't come in for a cup of coffee?
There might even be some pudding left over from lunch.
- I don't think so.
- It's rice pudding.
You guys are supposed to like that.
No.
No.
We have no time.
We must get supplies and leave.
Uh, stay a while.
I could tell you about my work with, uh, arterial transplants.
- Some other time.
- Hey, I just had a wild thought.
How would it be if I came back with you guys to your hospital give all your staff a chance to meet me?
We could get everybody together, and I could give them a talk.
Huh?
N-No.
We must leave quickly.
You know, perhaps the major has a good idea.
Yes.
I think he would be quite useful.
I'd have to be back in a couple of hours.
That is no problem.
The hospital is close by.
- Great.
- Uh, wait a minute.
Major, where you goin'?
I'm going with these boys back to meet everyone at their hospital.
- Should be a real treat for 'em.
- You can't do that, Major!
- What?
- What he means is, uh, you can't leave us.
- What would we do without you?
- What are you talking about?
I'm off duty.
Well, sir, who's gonna help us plan the dance tonight?
- Ah!
The dance.
- What dance?
Nobody told me about any dance.
- Let's all go to the colonel's office and discuss it, sir.
- The colonel's office.
Let go, and that's an order!
These boys are in a big hurry.
That is true.
We must go now.
Major, what about the class this afternoon?
You know, on how to recognize the enemy.
You had all that in basic training.
If you can't recognize the enemy by now, you're in a lot of trouble.
All set.
Let's go!
Break a leg.
I've seen the man work.
He's a qualified surgeon.
He gives me the creeps.
He's always watching everything.
Last night, I came out of the shower, and, sure enough, there he was.
That is suspicious.
Last night was supposed to be my night.
- Colonel?
- What do you want me to do?
Just check up on him.
That's all I ask.
Colonel Potter!
Sir?
Major Burns just drove off with two men in a jeep.
They were bad men, sir.
I think they were the enemy.
What men?
What jeep?
What enemy?
These two guys come in asking for supplies, so we give them what they want.
And then Major Burns gets in the jeep with them and goes off.
- Why?
Did they force him?
- No, ma'am.
I think he wanted to go.
Radar, get on the phone, call the M.P. S, alert them about that jeep.
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute.
Radar?
- How do you know those men were enemy soldiers?
- Captain Cho told us.
- Captain Cho?
How did he know?
- I don't know.
He just knew.
- Well, isn't that interesting?
- Hmm.
- Oh, what is it now?
- Sir.
- I.D.'s, please.
- Why are you stopping us?
Been a slow day?
Need a little excitement to break up the monotony?
We have important business to attend to.
Sorry, sir, but there have been some infiltrators coming down to get supplies.
Oh, these men are not infiltrators.
One good look should tell you that.
Now, listen.
I am Major Frank Burns, MASH 4077 th.
- The Major Burns.
I'm sure you've heard of me.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, of course you have.
I can vouch for these men personally.
-  We're checking everybody, Major.
- Now, listen, Sergeant instead of bothering doctors who are trying to do some good in this world why don't you run out and catch some kidnappers?
Let's go.
I should have done something to save Major Burns, but I was afraid.
If those men had recognized me, they would have panicked.
- Look, you did what you could.
- Yeah.
Look at the bright side maybe they'll keep him.
Well, I'm glad you're all here.
Ah, Colonel Potter.
What a surprise.
- I'm glad we had the furniture cleaned.
- The new drapes are due Friday.
Okay, cut the phony baloney.
The ball game's over.
- What's up?
- I just checked with Headquarters and I know all about Paik or Cho or whatever your name is.
I'm gonna have to put you under arrest.
Colonel, you're not gonna throw away a perfectly good doctor on a technicality?
"Technicality"?
This man's the enemy.
- Enemy "schmenemy".
He's a surgeon.
- And a good one.
Please, gentlemen.
I knew it couldn't last.
- I just wanted to help.
- Look, I understand what you were trying to do and between you, me and the grand piano, it wasn't a bad idea.
But damn it!
I could lose my pension, wind up in the stockade.
- There must be some way we can keep him.
- Nada.
It was Houlihan and Burns who put the bee on him.
If they can figure it out, anybody can.
Well, that's true.
- Dr. Paik, I'm sorry.
- Me too.
You did what you could.
You don't suppose your side would be interested in an exchange?
We keep you and they keep Frank?
No, they'd never go for that.
Why don't I start out with a couple of jokes then go into a personal autobiography of myself.
I'll tell them about the Boy Scouts, how I rode a two-wheeler at 13 and how I worked my way through med school selling burial plots door to door.
I wish I had time to get a haircut.
Well, they'll understand.
After all, it's war.
Did I mention that I taught my rabbit how to smile?
-  - Why did we stop?
Get out.
Why?
Something wrong with the jeep?
Don't tell me we're out of gas.
We are past the checkpoint, and we don't need you anymore.
Besides, you're driving us crazy and we don't need a hostage that badly.
- Get out.
- What do you mean?
You simpleton.
We are North Koreans.
Honest Injun?
Don't hurt me!
I'll tell you anything you wanna know.
- Get out of the jeep.
- You're not gonna torture me or anything?
Some other time.
Go back to your camp.
It's the best thing you could do for our side.
You ungrateful creeps!
I wouldn't lecture to you if you got down on your knees and begged me!
Well, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
- And you lost your watch too.
- Forget it.
With those Chinese characters I could never read it anyway.
Here.
Take this.
It's a little going-away present.
A cake we made in the Mess.
- Thank you.
- Don't thank us till you taste it.
Cheer up, gentlemen.
The war will not last forever.
Yeah.
Maybe afterwards, you'll come to the States sometime and we'll all get together and have a few beers.
Or perhaps you'll take an exotic cruise to my country and we'll share some rice wine.
I bet you know some terrific places for Chinese food.
One or two but they're in Chicago.
Good-bye.
Geez, he was a pretty good doctor.
- What a waste.
- I just hope he doesn't take a bite out of that cake.
- There's a saw in it.
-  Major.
-  - Those clowns didn't fool me for a minute.
- I knew they were Commies the whole time.
- Then why did you go with them?
- I figured I'd gather a little intelligence.
- You could use it.
They pulled guns on me, so I gave them both a quick karate chop knocked 'em cold and headed back to camp.
- Why didn't you bring back the jeep?
- The jeep?
Yeah, thejeep.
It's a big green thing.
Looks like a turtle with a thyroid condition.
You let a jeep filled with medical supplies fall into enemy hands.
Well, it was the humanitarian thing to do.
I mean, after all, they may be Commies, but they're people too, sort of.
Good.
We've got a whole tent filled with North Koreans in need of attention.
- They're all yours.
- All by myself?
Don't whine, Frank.
You're the humanitarian.
- Oh, and what are you guys?
- We're all-night poker players.
- Come on, Hawk, Colonel.
- Good night, Albert.
Good night, Dr. Schweitzer.
Whole tent full?
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Doctor, do you want me to hold that for you?
- Uh, Nurse.
- Doctor?
Scratch, please.
Left infrascapula.
Ah!
Bull's-eye.
- Lucky shot.
-  Lucky shot, nothing.
I know my anatomy.
I wish I knew your anatomy like you know your anatomy.
-  Anybody?
Time.
- About 0100.
around the clock.
Sure beats workin' around here.
I'm so bushed, I can't remember my last patient.
- He had quintuplets.
- Oh, yeah.
¡Silencio!
How can I operate with all this flapdoodle going on?
Where there's a war, there's a way, Frank.
Wipe.
- How many more out there?
- I counted 19 when I came in.
Nineteen?
There were 19 two hours ago.
They restock the shelves when they run out.
I'm closing, Colonel.
A couple more minutes, and I can take over for you.
- Why?
- Why?
Well, you must be dog-tired.
Yes, but why me more than anyone else?
Oh, because you're old uh, older than the rest of us, sir.
And you look dead uh, beat.
Major, I can match you incision for incision, suture for suture clamp for clamp, patient for patient!
But not goof for goof.
Oh, mind your own kipper, Pierce.
Sir, I was only trying I know what you were trying to do.
I was the first man in.
I'll be the last man out.
If they have to carry me out.
- Hi, Klinger.
- What you got, Igor?
- For Radar.
- I'll give it to the fink when he gets back.
- Why "fink"?
- 'Cause every time the fink gets a four-day pass I get stuck with the job.
I may look like a perfect secretary, but I'd rather dig latrines.
- Look at those nails.
- Here, for you.
Do you know what this is?
This is the end to my brilliant military career.
- You're crazy.
- Not anymore.
I got something better than crazy.
If Frank Burns makes any more patronizing cracks about my age I'll take him behind the motor pool and let the air out of his tires.
He didn't mean anything by it, Colonel.
He was only trying to insult you.
- Colonel, I've got to talk to you right away!
- Klinger, go put on a dress.
Pardon me, sir.
Did you call me "Klinger"?
- If you aren't Klinger, who the Sam Hill are you?
- Sam Hill maybe.
I am Zoltan, King of the Gypsies.
You just made my day.
Zoltan, King of the Gypsies, you're talking yourself into a court-martial, soldier.
You can't court-martial me.
I'm not in the army.
- Not in the army?
- No, sir.
I'm not an American citizen.
- I think he's on to something.
- I wouldn't miss it for all the chipped beef in Korea.
Klinger, how can you be king of the Gypsies when you're Lebanese?
Good question.
I was stolen from the Gypsies by two ruthless Lebanese peasants who brought me up as their own flesh and blood.
- I like this.
- Mmm.
Look.
A signed confession from the culprits.
It's a signed confession, all right.
And I've been elected king of my whole tribe.
- This is an urgent request to return and ascend the throne.
- Sorry.
I don't read Gypsy.
- Take my word for it.
- Of course.
- I'll be waiting in my tent with my bags packed.
- You'll have a long wait.
Sir, my people need me.
Klinger, if I bought this story, they'd boot me out of the army.
It's true.
Now I know why the sounds of violins set my blood on fire.
Why I'm so attracted to storefront windows.
Why, when I smell paprika, I face towards Budapest.
- Why I have the urge to roam.
- Zoltan, roam the hell outta here.
- If you'd like your tea leaves read - I prefer them green.
- Dismissed.
- ##  ##  I think the king just gave himself a hernia.
- No more rhubarb, Private?
- All gone, sir.
"All gone, sir"?
I'd like to know how come rhubarb always disappears the minute I show up.
- It's not just rhubarb, Frank.
People disappear.
- Stay out of this, snooping sam.
Why do you always give me a bad time every time I give you a bad time?
Aw, blow it out your bagpipe.
Hello, Major.
May I join you for some pleasant conversation?
- Sure, Major.
Sit down and keep your mouth shut.
-  We got a call from Korean Army Hospital 426.
They're screaming for supplies and surgeons.
They're up to their scalpels in casualties.
They need our help.
- For criminy sakes!
We're surgeons, not supermen.
- You can say that again.
Oh, are you comparing us to your Colonel Penobscott again?
If Donald were here, he'd be the first one to volunteer.
That's how he became engaged.
She asked for volunteers.
-  - I heard that.
- Here's your rhubarb, sir.
- Oh, sure.
- I'll volunteer, sir.
Just say the word.
- Sorry, Major.
They didn't ask for nurses, and I'm not offering.
I'm dispatching two surgeons and all the supplies a jeep can carry.
How do we pick the two surgeons?
- Alphabetically is fine with me.
- Oh, sure.
Captain Pierce begins with a "P," and that puts Major Burns with a "B" right at the top.
- Really?
- Don't blow your top, Major.
It won't be alphabetical.
- I suggest straws.
Two shortest out of three pulls the duty.
- Where do you get three?
Burns, one, Pierce, two, Hunnicutt, three.
- Potter, four.
- You, sir?
- Yes, me.
- But, sir, you're a grandfather.
Yes, a grandfather, but not Whistler's mother.
Well, you're spry for your age, Colonel.
Anyone can see that.
But as commanding officer and senior member of the surgical staff shouldn't you put your junior officers on this detail?
- How do we shut Junior up?
- Suture his lips.
Burns, I may not be a colt, but I'm not an old gray mare either.
- She's right.
- I'm just as fit for this detail as you are.
Maybe fitter!
We'll settle this right now.
Frank, how would you like to be our first kamikaze surgeon?
- It's simple.
You just do a lobotomy on yourself.
- Stick it in the freezer.
May I commandeer this deck for one minute?
- Oh, but, sir, look.
- Holy cow!
Sorry, son.
Two low cards go for a ride.
-  - Hunnicutt.
##  Ten.
I guess I get to wave bye-bye.
Burns.
Five.
I do better with straws.
Three.
Looks like a marriage, Frank.
I know I can do better, but at my age, can I wait?
- Deuce.
- Well, that's a gyp.
That means you go and I stay.
- Oh, that's good.
- Well, Frank, looks like you've been jilted again.
It's you and me, Pierce.
Burns, load the jeep with supplies and don't forget my Geritol.
Gowns, masks, sterile cotton, tape Tape.
What did you do with the tape?
Here.
Just 'cause I'm a Gypsy doesn't mean I stole it.
Today you're a Gypsy.
Yesterday you were a ballerina.
Don't scoff, sir.
Your fate is an open book to me.
- You're daffy.
- We read the future.
So can I. In about five seconds, I'm gonna bust your nose.
Don't bite off more than you can chew, sir.
Believe me, the future is written in the palm of your hand.
Oh, yeah?
What does it say?
- It says  - What is it?
What do you see?
- Let me be the first to congratulate you, sir.
- Somebody die, leave me money?
- No, sir.
You're gonna cover yourself with glory.
- I am?
- Oh, Yes.
You've got a strong glory line.
- Go on.
You're about to go on a trip, sir, a mission of mercy to a hospital many miles away.
I see I see a medal.
It's gold.
- A gold medal?
-  - It's turning green.
- Green?
It says, "For your total disregard of danger, for operating above and beyond the call of duty for insisting to go on this mission instead of Colonel Potter".
Oh, buzz off, goofball!
I know what your little game is, and it won't work.
Sir, you're 20 years younger than the colonel.
So?
The old and the weak get knocked off.
The young and the strong survive.
It's the law of the jungle.
-  - A lion should eat your face.
- Where does this go, sir?
- There's room up front, Your Highness.
Ah, good idea.
The colonel can use it as a footrest.
I'll rest my foot on your butt.
Climb in, Pierce.
Where's your gun?
Sulking under my cot.
We're not on speaking terms.
Go kiss and make up.
You're taking it with you.
Colonel, if I touch that gun, I'll just trigger another argument.
Pierce, you're taking along your sidearm.
Correct.
I'm taking along my right-side arm and my left-side arm.
You need an enemy before you can surrender.
Didn't they teach you that in basic training?
Pierce, I'm not riding shotgun.
Get that weapon.
- Gun boy.
- Ah, yes, sahib.
My feet are like wings.
##  - You're not hitting those high notes anymore.
- Hurt myself, sir.
- I thought so.
- Coffee, good and strong.
Thanks, Zoltan.
This will come in handy.
- Your parka, Colonel.
- Wouldn't know where to put it.
- You'll need this.
The roads are bumpy.
- I know where to put that.
- Your artillery, pard.
- Is it loaded?
- Filled it with water myself.
- Watch out, everybody.
I shoot to drown.
- Do you think you can find it?
- If we run into trouble, I'll call Triple "A".
- Have a safe trip, gentlemen.
- How about a little kiss for the road?
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- Then how about one for me?
- On this mission, you represent the 4077 th.
Don't forget that.
- Forget what?
MASH would never send an officer who would disgrace us.
- You're right, Margaret.
I'm staying.
- Sit down, Pierce.
- You're right, Margaret.
I'm staying.
- Sit down, Pierce.
Beware, sirs.
I see snipers and land mines and artillery.
- You see any good restaurants?
- Cut the chatter.
Let's move it.
Kick the chocks out from under the wheels.
Flaps up.
No offense, Margaret.
Contact!
We're off!
- Start the engine!
- Oh, yeah.
Don't look now, but I think we're being followed by the war.
I've been followed by bigger wars than this.
Don't fight it, Colonel.
This one's bigger than both of us.
- Col.
Sherman Potter, MASH 4077.
- Where you headed, sir?
Korean Hospital 426 near Kumhwa.
Are we close?
- Two miles, dead ahead.
- Can you make that "straight ahead"?
You'd better turn back, sir.
This area isn't secured.
Neither are we.
We're a mass of insecurity.
A lot of people bleeding to death up there, Sergeant.
Capt.
Pierce and I are surgeons.
We're goin' in.
Goin' in isn't the problem, Colonel.
Getting out is.
- Sounds like marriage.
- Let's go.
- Good luck.
- Okay.
- Sirs!
- Is our room ready?
We booked the Syngman Rhee suite overlooking the motor pool.
- Your commanding officer's expecting us.
- Yes, sir.
Inside.
Watch that.
It's more valuable than all the pickled cabbage in Korea.
- Verstehen?
- I watch, sir!
They call this a hospital?
I wouldn't operate on your horse under these conditions.
My horse wouldn't be caught dead in here.
Gentlemen.
I'm Major Choi.
- Col.
Potter.
This is Capt.
Pierce.
- Hiya.
- How can I thank you for coming?
- How about 5,000 apiece in small bills?
Two enemy divisions attacked our forces early this morning.
- Successfully, I see.
- I'm short of help and drugs.
- Supplies are parked outside, Major.
- I'll send for them right now.
Wash up over there.
We go to work.
I think we got the job.
Thank you.
Metzenbaum scissors.
Scissors.
Scissors.
I don't know what to do with "Metzenbaum".
Uh, that instrument there pretending to be sterile.
That's it.
Good.
What'd you sterilize this in, egg drop soup?
We do the best we can, Captain, with the little we have.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm opposed to germ warfare.
I'm not too crazy about that warfare either.
- Oh, great.
Right in the middle of resecting a bowel.
-  -  -  Whoops.
- Getting tired, Colonel?
- Doin' fine.
Haven't let a patient slip through my fingers yet.
You know, Colonel, in this light, you look just like Greer Garson.
- In what picture?
- Mrs. Miniver.
How long we been at this?
I started surgery in 1932.
- I mean, this session.
- So do I. - Maybe we should charge them piecework.
- We can't.
This is war.
By the way, which war is this?
The latest war to end all wars.
More of Klinger's coffee?
No, thanks.
It's beginning to dissolve my fillings.
I told him strong, not lethal.
I can hardly keep my eyes open.
- They're closed.
- You see what I mean?
Your eyelids are beginning to send you messages too.
Time for a little shut-eye.
I don't take orders from my eyelids.
- Sleep.
Come on.
- I don't take orders from you either.
Come on.
I know what you've been going through.
You're exhausted.
I am not.
I slept last year.
If I said the word "sleep" three times to you, I'd put you right under.
- Not a chance.
- Oh, yeah?
Watch this.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
- Evening, Klinger.
- Evening who, sir?
Sorry.
Zoltan.
How's the tribe?
My tribe, they're yearning for me, sir.
Of course they are.
What are you doing?
Working on a plan to turn the motor pool into a Gypsy caravan.
You too?
Any news about Hawkeye and the colonel?
- They didn't call.
- I'm getting worried.
I don't like to have them stay out so late on a school night.
Put your mind at ease, sir.
We Gypsies have ways of finding things out.
Crystal ball?
Cards.
Concentrate with me, sir.
Ten of clubs.
Ace of spades.
King of diamonds.
Jack of hearts.
This This is the crucial card.
Ah!
Queen of diamonds.
Holy mackerel!
I drew a straight!
- Hawkeye.
- Huh?
Did l I did.
I fell asleep.
You're one heck of a hypnotist.
- It works.
I just did it backwards.
- You can take over now.
Game's tough, and you're sending in your ace reliever, huh?
That's right.
We're losing, and the bases are loaded.
Listen, you wanna finish a great dream for me?
If I can't come up with one of my own.
I was in a candlelit room soft music in the background, soft girl in the foreground.
Stop right there.
I'm a married man.
Well, can you at least buy her a drink till I get back?
Sure.
I watched your work.
It was a magnificent performance.
Souvenir programs are available in the lobby.
Major, I wish you'd drop in on us one day at the 4077 th and watch the whole team in action.
We do a matinee that has 'em rolling in the aisles.
- We have a good bunch of doctors.
- Even Frank Burns?
You mean old Ferret Face?
- You've heard of him.
- Yes.
He worked on a few of my men.
- And they survived?
- Yes.
They were lucky.
Again, thank you for all your help.
Thank you for all your wounded, without which our help would have meant nothing.
- Well, good-bye, Major.
- Good-bye.
May luck go with you.
-  - Yes, he may.
Tell him to hurry.
- Anan-nyung.
- Anan-nyung.
- I could use a belt.
- Why, are your pants falling down?
Klinger thought of everything else.
You don't suppose Uh?
Bless that Gypsy.
Belly up to the bar, Hawkeye.
Delighted!
To Klinger!
To Klinger's nose!
- That's a double.
- All right.
To Zoltan!
- To Zoltan's nose!
That's a double.
- That's a double.
- To Charles de Gaulle!
- And his nose!
- That's a triple!
-  - Here's to your nose.
- Oh, that's a That's a half a one.
-  -  -  Oh!
-  - Hawkeye, your gun!
- Forget that!
Come on!
What are they bombing us for?
We're already bombed.
They totaled our jeep.
- The case will be in court for years.
-  Get down!
You wanna be a dead duck?
- No.
I'd rather be a live chicken.
-  You wanna cut it out!
Oh.
That was close.
I believe my life is about to pass before my eyes.
- Let me know when it does.
I love a parade.
- Even short ones?
- Too young to die, Pierce?
- I was hoping I'd make it to Thursday.
Well, I'm gonna give 'em one hell of a fight before they drag me off to any Chinese prison camp.
What's the matter, you don't like egg foo young?
Miserable place for a regular-army man to spend the war.
Well, I don't believe anybody's made the offer yet.
-  - I think we just got an invi invitation.
- What are you shooting for?
- Well, that's the way this game is played.
They shoot at us.
We shoot at them.
The last one to shoot wins.
- Here.
It's your turn.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
The reason they're shooting is that they're angry.
If I shoot back, they'll just get angrier.
Pierce, you got a good sense of humor but a lousy sense of timing.
- Fire that weapon.
- Fire it?
I don't even like looking at it.
I said, "Fire that weapon"!
All right.
You're fired.
- I did it as gently as I could.
- That was an order, Pierce.
Oh, waiter.
Would you take this man's order, please?
- Fire the gun, Hawkeye.
- Look, Colonel.
I'll treat their wounds, heal their wounds, bind their wounds but I will not inflict their wounds.
- You can't just sit there.
- I may be sitting on the outside but I'm running on the inside.
- You love life that little?
- I hate guns that much.
For God's sake, man, defend yourself.
Don't think of it as a gun.
Think of it as a great little noisemaker the loudest cap pistol in Korea.
Just shoot it and scare the living hell outta them.
Well, that that I can do.
All right, everybody, I start shooting at the count of three.
What's the matter?
Oh, thank you.
Out of the way!
Look out!
Out of the way!
Behind the trees!
Take cover!
Look out!
There.
I used up all my bullets.
Now can I go home?
- You're a crazier soldier than a surgeon.
-  Thank you.
- You-You hear that?
- I don't hear a thing.
That's what I mean.
Nobody's there.
They amscrayed.
Come here.
Come here, Pierce.
Take a look.
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.
We're one of you.
You're one of us.
Apple pie, Betty Grable.
- Clara Bow.
- "Clara Bow"?
Frank's right.
You are old.
- You medics?
-  Surgeons with a MASH unit.
- What are you doing up here?
- Lookin' for broads.
- You're not gonna find any there, Captain.
- No, no.
He's-He's lookin' for c-casualties.
Oh, they all pulled out.
We're moving out.
Let's go.
You didn't hit a single thing, sharpshooter.
Well, you fired as many shots as I did and you were the one who said you shot the apple off the kaiser's head.
Confidentially, Hawkeye, I couldn't hit a bullet with the side of a barn.
Oh.
Look out for that bush.
- You all right, sir?
- Great!
Why shouldn't I be?
- Well, you've been through some terrible ordeals.
- What ordeals?
The Korean hospital ordeal, the bunker ordeal.
Piece of cake.
Enjoyed every minute.
Well, I think I'll turn in after I do my 50 pushups.
Care to join me?
Uh, no, thank you, sir.
Good night.
Thanks for looking in, Major.
-  - Come in.
- Finished with your tea, sir?
- It was delicious, Klinger.
- May I read the tea leaves, sir?
- By all means.
Says here, you're gonna take pity on a poor Gypsy boy who desperately wants to go home to his people.
Let's have a look.
The way I read it, the poor Gypsy boy is in danger of annoying his commanding officer.
And if he keeps it up, he'll get a boot in his tambourine.
- Got ya, sir.
Good night.
- Good night, Klinger.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
-  Scissors.
-  Scissors.
- In my hand, not my foot!
- Sorry.
Cut this.
No, no, no.
Down here.
Not up there!
- Sorry.
-  You're full of"sorry's" today.
- I'm sorry.
-  You don't have to be snotty, Doctors.
What can I say after I've said I'm sorry?
Always a comeback.
All closed.
Orderly!
Ha-ha!
I finished first.
- And my nurse can beat up your nurse.
- Your nurse could beat up him.
Oh, my God, there's a rotten cantaloupe in this man's stomach.
You're looking at Frank's rotten head.
- Doctors are supposed to be comrades in arms.
- Yeah, you want to tango?
- Doctors are supposed to be comrades in arms.
- Yeah, you want to tango?
We'll leave the skin and sub "Q" open.
I'll close in five days.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Always put off today what you can do tomorrow.
- Frank, when was the last time you had your gums bled?
-  Klinger.
Sire?
You beckoned the prince of Toledo?
-  Post-op, Prince, for some intensive caring.
- Ja wohl, Herr Leutnant.
- You all right, Major?
- Oh, slight twinge.
Indigestion.
- Last night's chicken beaks.
- No, she's really sick.
Yeah?
Let me see.
You're going to meet a tall, dark stranger who sells insurance out of a rumble seat.
Well, that's what I saw!
- ##  - Hey, what's up, Colonel?
- I'm goin' to Tokyo.
- No kiddin'!
Congratulations!
Mildred got a flight to Japan, and I got a week's "R" and "R".
How romantic!
A second honeymoon.
Oh, at his age, they don't romance anymore.
Like hell!
How do you think I got these bags under my eyes?
-  - During my absence, the second in command will be in charge.
I strongly resent that!
Unfortunately, he means you, Frank.
Of course, I knew that.
- Command accepted, sir!
- Hot dog.
Some people around here are gonna have to get up on their toes.
- I don't think I'm up to it.
- My tutu's in the cleaners.
- Aw, go fry an egg.
- Well, I got things to do.
##  Colonel, Burns isn't fit to command.
No sweat.
Radar runs the outfit anyway.
Yeah, but he makes crazy rules.
Chew your food a hundred times.
- I showed the fink.
I swallowed my steak whole.
- Colonel!
- Klinger.
- When you're in Tokyo, would you ask Mrs. Potter to see if she can find this material at Goldstein's on the Ginza?
- I'll ask.
- I'll need three yards.
Make it four.
I'm puttin' in pleats.
Red is okay.
Blue is okay.
But no aquamarine.
- Why not?
- It matches his skin.
Nobody'd know I was there.
Why are you worried about Burns being in charge?
You never follow orders anyway.
That's not the point.
Burns is an irritant.
- Like fingernails on a blackboard.
- Ooh.
I hate that sound.
- Can't you do something?
- Like sit him down, have a talk with him?
No, like stand him up and have him shot.
Don't be absurd.
There'd be an inquiry.
- Oh.
- Hey, I got an idea.
You could take him to Tokyo.
- Yeah.
He can be your traveling companion.
- Tote your barge.
- Post your bail.
- I can tote my own barge, thank you.
- Look, what this boils down to is who gets stuck with Burns.
- Mm-hmm.
- Now if you were in command, what would you do?
- I'd take him to Tokyo.
That's why you're not in command.
Dismissed.
-  - That pain again?
- Yes, Major.
- Margaret, when you're sick, can't you call me Frank?
You know I'm an engaged person.
- Let me probe your abdomen.
- You'll go insane.
No, I won't.
I'm not an animal.
I'm a doctor.
I can curb my lust.
Very well.
- Margaret!
-  I knew it!
I knew it!
I'm sorry.
It was last night's chili.
- I'm afraid I have a bad appendix.
- Let me operate?
Please!
It isn't necessary.
It isn't a hot appendix.
It's chronic.
Let me remove it.
I'll put it in a nice mason jar with a little alcohol.
I'll bring you ice cream with chocolate sauce and perhaps some Oreo cookies.
- No!
- Show me some consideration.
Let me cut you open.
- Is she okay, sir?
- Sometimes she favors this hoof.
- I'll bet it's those army shoes.
- They ain't army.
They were made by a Korean blacksmith, Hopalong Wang.
- Next time, I shoe her myself.
- You know how?
I can put horseshoes on a mosquito.
Gee, sir, is there anything you can't do?
Yeah.
Get rid of this gas.
- Last night's chili.
- Like eating a volcano.
Give her a good grooming every other day.
She likes that.
Oh, I know, sir.
Once she smiled at me with her nice, big yellow teeth.
Give her plenty of salt, plenty of water.
I like regular irrigation.
Hmm, you sound just like my mom.
She always says "Better to hold the phone than to get a kidney stone".
Wonderful woman.
You'll be in good hands, sweetheart.
Radar's gonna take care of you.
You know, Radar, being away from Mrs. Potter, this mare's been a blessing.
- She knows you're leaving, sir.
Look at her eyes.
- Like Fay Wray.
- I don't know her.
- King Kong this big monkey, carried her to the top of the Empire State Building.
Wow!
I had heard there were some weirdos in New York.
-  - Come.
- Colonel - Oh, turn around for a second, Major.
Let me get decent.
Something on your mind?
Sir, request permission to go to Tokyo to have my appendix removed.
- You got a hot one?
- Chronic.
Occasional flare-up.
That can go on for years.
Why remove a muffler just 'cause it backfires once in a while?
- Well -  Attention, all personnel!
We have winners of the Abbott and Costello look-alike contest.
- Colonel, the reason l - Oh, hold it!
I'm entered in this.
The winners are Corporal Klinger and prisoner of war Chang Suk Yin.
Oh, darn it!
I knew they'd bring in a ringer.
The winners receive a Norman Rockwell print clipped from last week's Saturday Evening Post.
- Lucky buggers.
Where were we?
- My appendix.
Oh, yeah.
I can't recommend elective surgery.
But if she flares up, we've got a whole corral of surgeons here.
Colonel, Major Burns usually handles the simple operations and I don't want him to touch me.
Oh, now the skunk is outta the bag.
- If my appendix becomes acute - God forbid.
God forbid.
Can you arrange for Dr. Pierce to operate?
- I'll give him the word.
- Thank you, sir.
- Keep a firm abdomen.
-  I'm sorry you lost, sir.
- Thank you.
-  Attention!
Corporal Klinger will accept the Rockwell print by himself.
Chang Suk Yin has escaped.
Radar, so I can read on the plane, get me that book by Dr. Hugo Schlecter.
- Schlecter?
- How to Sweat with Closed Pores.
- Dermatologist.
- Yes, sir.
- Sir.
- Klinger.
No pearls?
No dress?
How come you're out of uniform?
I gave up tryin' to get a discharge, sir.
I'm so depressed.
Depressed?
You just won a Norman Rockwell print.
I know, but I'm still in the dumps.
Buck up, son.
I'll bring back that material from Tokyo.
You'll make yourself a beautiful evening gown.
You'll feel like a new man.
That's what I wanted to tell you, Colonel.
You don't have to bother.
How about a nice pair of nylons?
Send your morale a mile high.
- No, thanks anyway.
- Found your book, sir.
Hey, Klinger, congratulations on the contest.
You lucky guy.
Dummy up!
For a guy who looks like Abbott and Costello, he sure has no sense of humor.
I still think I should've won that contest.
- Who's on first.
- What?
What's on second.
Ha!
Ha.
- Glad I caught you, Colonel.
- Yeah, Hawkeye.
I was, uh, helping Father Mulcahy look at some pictures.
- He's gotta pick the "Nun of the Week".
- Dedicated man.
On the Ginza, there's a little newspaper stand right across the street from Goldstein's.
Would you get me this month's issue of Nudist Frolics Naked Health, and the Bare Back News?
I'll be in uniform.
I can't go in there.
- Ask Mrs. Potter.
- Okay.
She's a good scout.
You really go for those nudie magazines, don't you?
- Just for the volleyball scores.
- Ever go to one of those skin farms?
- Once.
Didn't have the nerve to put down my ukulele.
-  Sir, your plane leaves Kimpo in one hour.
Right.
Oh, Hawkeye, I almost forgot.
Lf, uh, Major Houlihan's appendix has to come out she wants you to do the job.
- What about Burns and his 10 magic thumbs?
- She put the kibosh on him.
Zorro will leave his mark.
- Take care of the mare, Radar!
- Yow!
-  - Go away, Frank!
- I told you not to bother me!
- Fuller Brush Man.
I have a special today.
A back scratcher in the form of a naked doctor.
- Did I say come in?
- Only part of me is in.
The best part is still outside.
- What do you want?
- I didn't come to see you, just your appendix.
We can discuss my appendix in the O.R., post-op, anyplace but here.
No, it's Wednesday.
I always make tent calls.
You know, that robe does something for you.
- It does something for me too.
- Watch it, Doctor.
I'm just a growing boy with active glands.
When you're in my tent, you'll curb your glands.
Next time I'll leave 'em tied up outside.
Why are such skillful medical hands attached to someone like you?
Sorry, I come as a set.
Potter told me about your problem.
So, uh, Major, if you'll just lie down there -  No, no, no, no.
- Your lips say, "No, no, no," but your appendix says, "Yes, yes, yes".
My appendix does not bother me.
When it flares up, I'll call you.
You know, when you're angry, you look just like Victor Mature.
Please leave.
Margaret, a pre-operation grope is essential.
Well - And fun.
- Uh, no!
Here.
Here.
It hurts right here.
- Oh!
You swine!
- Well, you know Radar's comin', Sophie.
You're gonna have a nice brush and rub.
Holy socks!
-  Ready, Doctor?
-  Ready.
Ha!
You now owe me - $3,427.
- You on Diners?
- No credit, Elroy.
- Take a traveler's check?
- Sure.
- I'll find the traveler.
You take his check.
- Ooh!
- Aah!
Oh!
Uh, sirs.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
The colonel's mare is lyin' down.
Her eyes and her nose are running.
I told you to shovel out that corral.
- When a horse is down, it means she's sick.
- I come from Maine.
All I've ever done is take a lobster's thermidor.
- Something's wrong!
- Probably "mal de mare".
- Are you sure she wasn't just rolling in the manure?
- As a little pick-me-up?
No, she's sick!
And I promised to take care of her.
- Just take a look.
- No, I don't make stable calls.
But this is serious.
Colonel Potter will have me executed and court-martialed.
- Come on.
Let's take a look.
- I'm not a veterinarian.
- You're a veteran.
- Close enough for jazz.
Let's go play horsey.
Now, these fellas are people doctors, but they know where you keep everything.
- Watch the legs, Hawk.
- Yeah, I'll watch the legs.
You tell her not to kick me.
- Don't kick him, Sophie.
- Thanks.
- Hope she knows I'm a doctor.
- Show her your diploma.
- Oh, come on, guys.
Stop horsin' around.
-  - You know what I mean.
- Try your stethoscope.
Hello, hello.
Yeah, it works fine.
- On the horse.
- Oh, the big brown thing?
Yes!
- Mm-hmm.
- Anything?
Congestion?
I'm picking up Eddie Arcaro.
Oh, for Pete's sakes!
I don't hear a thing.
Maybe the speaker's broken.
- Maybe she's not plugged in.
- Oh Hell!
- What?
- You heard me!
H-E double toothpicks!
You guys don't care!
- Hey, hey, hey.
Radar, take it easy.
- Sure we care.
Who delivered your guinea pig's triplets Manny, Moe and Jack?
Who gave your chicken an aspirin when it got hysterical?
- You, sir.
-  Who belted Major Burns - when he wanted to cook your rabbit for Easter?
- Both you sirs.
What you What you have to understand, Radar is that we just don't know anything about horses.
- Well, she's a mare.
- Gender notwithstanding.
Radar, why don't you call Colonel Potter?
- I couldn't do that!
He'll kill me!
- Hey!
My father-in-law's been in Oklahoma for 50 years.
Once you're in a road company, it's very hard to get back to Broadway.
He lives there.
He knows all about horses, cows, pigs, all that stuff.
-  What town does he live in?
- Quapaw.
Where else?
A gas station, a grocery store and a fashionable restaurant called "Eats".
Radar, can you patch through a call to Quapaw, Oklahoma?
I can sure try.
- Let's go.
- Yeah.
Oh, Hawk, take the mare's temperature.
By law, there should be a nurse present.
I'll leave the door open.
Would you take off your coat, please.
Sparky?
Hi.
Yeah, it's Radar.
How ya doin'?
Good.
Uh, listen, Sparky, we wanna patch a call through to, uh, Quapaw, Oklahoma.
No, uh, Quapaw.
Yeah, look, I know you're busy, but No, it's not a personal call, it's-it's an animal call.
Geez, you don't have to shout my head off!
Our C.O.'s mare is sick.
- Make him a deal.
- Like what?
Um, try some aftershave lotion.
No, uh, it irritates his pimples.
Think Captain Pierce would part with some of his nudist magazines?
Sacrilege.
Uh, try, uh, a movie.
Oh, hey, Sparky.
Uh, listen, how'd you like a movie?
No, it's not a V.D. Movie.
It's a real movie.
We got a Rita Hayworth picture.
Gilda.
Huh?
No.
No.
No Indians, but a lot of hugging, kissing, and other violence.
Okay.
Yeah, terrific.
We'll hang on.
- Hey, he's going through to Honolulu.
- Great.
- What's her temperature?
- I dropped the thermometer in the corral.
The temperature of the manure is 62 degrees.
What?
Sparky?
Yeah?
Good!
- He's through to Honolulu.
- Love the booze, hate the music.
Yeah?
Okay!
He's got Seattle.
Hey, it's yesterday there.
- It's today here.
- It's always today here.
- What about tomorrow?
- Good point.
I wasn't born yesterday.
Yeah, Sparky.
Oklahoma City, right.
- Uh, yeah.
What's the name of your father-in-law?
- Floyd Hayden.
- Come on.
- No, really.
You got Quapaw.
Good.
Okay, look we're looking for a Mr. Floyd Hayden, H-A-Y-D-E-N.
# M-O-U-S-E # - Ah, okay, it's ringing.
- Oh, it's ringing!
Hello, hello?
Oh, it's still ringing.
- Pa!
Hi, it's B.J. - Got him.
No.
No, I'm not at the bus station.
I'm still in Korea.
No, we're not still fighting the Germans, Pa.
That was your war.
- Huh?
Yeah, I get a letter from Peg every day.
- Come on.
Come on.
- The horse.
- Wha Oh, look, Pa, I can't hang on too long.
We need your help.
Gimme a pencil and paper.
We got a sick horse here.
Yeah, a mare.
- She's down.
Just a minute.
What's her heart rate?
- Fifty.
Fifty.
Uh-huh.
Too fast.
- Well, look, uh - Could it be emotional?
- Could be.
Colonel Potter hasn't taken her out for a week.
- Hold on a minute, Floyd.
- Any growling in her stomach?
- Silencio.
Not a sound.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh!
All right, thanks, Pa.
Listen, you take care of yourself now.
- Yeah, I miss you too.
Oh, do me a favor will you?
- There's more.
Call Peg and tell her everything's fine.
- Except the horse.
Right.
Thanks.
- The horse.
- What?
- What?
What?
What?
Too much dry grass and not enough water.
She's got colic.
- Oh, that's serious!
- Floyd says it can kill her.
- Colic?
- Intestines are blocked.
We gotta keep her on her feet, so they won't twist.
And we gotta clean her out.
Lots and lots of warm water.
I think I'll stroll up to the front to see how the shooting's going.
- Hook this to the spigot up there.
- It looks awful high.
- You want the other end?
- It's not so high.
- Upsy-daisy.
- I love you, Daddy.
My word.
What's all the excitement about, Hawkeye?
Colonel Potter's horse is congested.
We're trying to help her out.
- You're a good Christian.
- Hallelujah.
Oh, I mean that sincerely, Hawkeye.
Sophie's one of God's creatures too.
Sometimes we all need a helping hand.
Hey, Hawkeye, she's trying to lay down again!
Walk her around!
Keep her moving!
The voice from above.
Easy, sweetheart.
It's not gonna hurt.
The water's warm.
Come on.
Come on.
In Atlantic City, this'd cost you seven-fifty.
Is it serious?
You want me to pray?
You got a horse prayer, Father?
I did one for a Great Dane with peritonitis.
- Pray taller.
- So be it.
- Keep her movin', Radar.
- Yo.
Come on, girl.
Come on.
Start the warm water.
Take your loved ones and move to higher ground.
Is it warm enough?
Just right.
I know just how you feel.
I once chewed a pack of gum with a bag of potato chips.
- Ready?
- I am, but the mare's a little tense.
Help's on the way.
-  Stand by.
- Stand by!
- Stand by!
- Standing by!
- Standing by!
- Standing by!
- Stand by.
-  Turn it on!
- Turn it on!
- Turn it on!
Here she comes!
Here she comes!
- Here she comes.
- Oy.
- How's it goin'?
- How's it going?
- Terrific.
-  Hold the water!
- Hold the water!
- Hold the water!
Holding!
Yeah, Sparky, the horse is doing just fine.
Hey, how was that movie we sent ya?
It wasn't Gilda?
Ah, gee, it said so on the box.
Ecstasy with Hedy Lamarr?
Oh, gee, I'm sorry, Sparky.
I hope you're not mad.
She what?
Naked?
With no clothes on?
Through the woods?
Well, when are you gonna send the film back?
Well, when will you guys be finished watching it?
- What do you mean next year?
-  Hey, listen, Colonel Potter's comin' in now.
L-I want that film back!
- Hiya, Radar.
- Welcome home, Colonel Potter, sir.
How's Mrs. Potter?
- Bought herself a 10-speed bicycle.
- Gee, she's really swell.
Get my bags to my tent and unpack 'em right away.
I've got some damp shorts in there.
- Wouldn't want 'em mildewed.
- Don't want 'em to mildew.
- How's everything?
- Oh, just fine, sir.
- How's the mare?
- Clean as a whistle.
- Inside and out.
- Good!
- Klinger.
- Present.
Radar didn't tell me you were in here.
- I'm not speaking to anybody.
- What the hell are you doing on my desk?
Depressed.
110%% .
- This is it?
Nonfunctioning?
- The end of life's highway.
What a shame.
- Well, what can I do?
I'll arrange a discharge.
- What was that, sir?
Severe depression is a ticket home.
I'll be packed in an hour!
I'm free!
I'm free!
Laverne, here I come!
Romancin' and dancin'!
##  Just blew it, didn't I?
- Yep.
- Now I'm really depressed.
Buck up, soldier.
I got the material for your dress.
- The blue or the red?
- The red.
Hot damn.
- Klinger!
- Sir.
Like to see you do that Top Hat number for the wounded.
- In the red dress?
- You'll kill 'em.
You're right.
##  - Colonel, that man's a lunatic.
- Yeah, but light on his feet.
- What is it, Burns?
I'm exhausted.
- Well, sir, while you were gone Pierce committed six major infractions of military regulations.
What were they?
Number one In the Mess Tent yesterday, he made a face at me.
- He did?
- Yes, sir.
He crossed his eyes and stuck out his tongue.
Like this.
I don't have to hear the other five.
I'll take the appropriate action.
- Good.
Sir, what are you gonna do?
- I'm going to sleep.
- Case dismissed.
- Yes, sir.
Hawkeye.
- Hawkeye.
- Huh?
Hmm?
Pulse is rapid, temperature's up.
I can't stand it anymore.
I'm ready.
Your tent or my father's Chevy?
-  My appendix.
- Okay, okay, okay.
Oh, isn't it funny how they always seem to arrive at 3:00 in the morning?
- Hey!
- Hey!
What?
What?
- Appendix.
- Never heard of him.
Come on.
Margaret's gotta have her appendix out.
- I need a gas passer.
- Okay, okay.
Send me in, coach.
- Oh, my God, it hurts.
-  Okay.
Come on.
Oh!
I'm sorry I had to wake you.
Forget it.
I've been asleep for 15 minutes.
- You ready, Beej?
- Ready when you are.
Kellye, remember Dr. Pierce prefers to work with curved blades.
- Yes, ma'am.
- And separate your large from your small needles.
Houlihan, don't kibitz.
You're the patient.
Funny how these things always happen in the wee hours of the morning.
- Why wasn't I called?
- Mask!
Well, I should be doing this surgery!
I know Major Houlihan's appendix better than any of you!
Burns, she asked for Pierce.
- I don't believe it!
- Great deal of conflict here.
You said it, brother Uh, Father.
- She doesn't want you here.
- I'm not leaving till I hear it from her own lips.
Listen to these lips, Frank.
Get out!
- She's delirious.
- Out!
I hope you have a big scar!
Can we get on with this?
I gotta get up in an hour and go to work.
All right, Margaret, relax.
Take a deep breath.
- I'm supposed to say that.
- Shut up, Margaret.
Now let's have some fun.
It's important to get on your feet the second or third day.
Thanks for doing such a wonderful job.
I'll throw in a guarantee.
Every thousand miles, I'll probe your chassis.
The important thing after an experience like this, my dear, is to keep moving.
Attagirl.
You know, you could've wound up with a knot in your intestine.
-  - Did you say something?
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
-  -  You tell Mr. Yee to vamoose.
This is an army hospital, not Macy's.
- Colonel say Mr. Yee gotta go.
- Nice translation, Radar.
Thank you, sir.
- How much for the lighter?
- Ask him how much for the lighter?
Uh, five dollar for lighter.
Four dollar if Mr. Yee can stay for "going out of business sale".
Make it three dollars and he can stay for another hour.
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Yee.
Come along, Radar.
What the hell is that?
Oh, it's a spirit post, sir.
Locals put it here to drive away evil spirits.
Get it off the road.
It's blocking traffic.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
You don't put any stock in any of those things, do you?
Uh, no, l But, uh All right.
Help that man up there!
I knew it.
I knew it!
Oh, come on, Frank.
That stuff kills through the nose.
- Tough tiddlywinks.
- What is that poison?
- Eau de swamp gas.
- Watch it!
That was a gift from a friend.
If you're trying to get Margaret to notice you, this won't help.
- Your relationship already stinks.
- Give it to me, you twit!
-  - Now look what you did.
- You cracked my mirror in two.
-  Now you have one for each face.
You're gonna have seven years of bad luck.
- Or two weeks in Korea, whichever's worse.
-  Sirs, the P.A. System conked out.
There's lots of incoming wounded.
Thanks, Radar.
Frank, you're a stark raving birdbrain.
Don't insult me in front of enlisted men, and that's an order.
- Radar, would you mind?
- Gladly, sir.
- Frank, you're a stark raving birdbrain.
- That's better.
- That is better.
- I like it a lot better.
- Frank, my finger's in the clamp!
- Oh, is it?
Sorry.
- Idiot!
- Well, nobody's perfect.
That's what I thought till I met Donald Penobscott.
Donald Penobscott, Donald Penobscott!
I'm sick and tired of hearing about him.
-  - It's about time you fixed that, wacko.
- I heard that.
- If I had my way, I'd boot you out of this man's army.
I like your thinking, sir.
Three bulbs in one day.
As if things aren't tough enough.
They say bad luck comes in threes, sir.
- Does that mean Frank Burns is a triplet?
- Jam it in your Jell-O, Pierce.
- I'm getting dark blood.
What's his pressure?
- 110 over 74.
Much too deep.
Well, it's the gauge.
It's stuck or broken.
How does a gauge break in the middle of an operation?
Oxygen, quick!
Somebody's wearing enough aftershave at 50 cents a bottle to put us all under.
Fifty cents?
Is that all you spent?
I haven't smelled anything like that since World War I. A Parisian house of instant happiness which I smelled in passing, of course.
- Ow!
- Give yourself a Purple Heart, Colonel.
And a purple finger.
We've met before, haven't we?
You're Corporal - Marsh.
- Right.
Des Moines, Iowa.
I was hit in the same leg two months ago.
They have no respect for my work.
Doc, uh, how's it look?
You're gonna be just fine, Corporal.
However, I don't think you're gonna wanna stay awake for this.
Nurse.
Hey, is that Father Mulcahy?
- The one and only.
- Ah, Corporal Marsh.
Are you here again?
Yeah, and without my Saint Christopher medal.
I must have lost it somewhere.
Well, I'll replace it, son.
Shall we?
Knife.
-  - A thousand pardons, sir.
You did that on purpose!
I'm confining you to quarters!
I'm confining you to quarters too.
Give me all your nickels and dimes.
- Keep your petticoats out of my face.
- And you keep your eyes closed.
- Screwball.
-  -  Was that a curse, Klinger?
- Yes, sir.
It starts the day he goes home to his wife.
- Margaret, you squirted saline all over me!
- I'm sorry.
It was an accident.
An accident, I'll bet.
My astrologist told me it was a bad year for war.
How do you explain it, Father?
Bishop O'Hara at the seminary had a brilliant explanation for phenomena such as these.
He said, "That's the way the ball bounces".
- The man should be canonized.
- Marsh here was canonized, twice in the same leg.
You all know what day this is?
Friday the 13th.
She's right.
And - Nah, doesn't mean a thing.
-  Don't say that, Frank.
I once spent Friday the 13th in a haunted house with a friend.
I was never more frightened.
- Did you see a ghost?
- No.
Her husband materialized out of nowhere.
My aunt once talked to the spirit of Sigmund Freud.
- That's impossible.
- How come he sent her a bill?
Somebody down here doesn't like us.
Some of the natives think it's evil spirits.
- The savages.
- Those savages were printing with movable type in 1403.
He's right.
I was in 1402, and the noise kept me awake all night.
The Koreans practice almost every religion known to man - including shamanism.
-  Shamanism?
The belief that spirits inhabit trees and houses and people.
- Diddly poo.
- That's the spirit, Frank.
- Jumpin' Jehosaphat!
- We gotta be jinxed.
Now, let's stop the malarkey about evil spirits, bad luck and jinxes.
That stuff comes right off the stable floor.
From now on, nothing will go wrong.
Except the lights.
Hold it a second.
How's the leg, Marsh?
Hey, great, Doc.
Hey, you seein' me off?
Nope, I'm runnin' you out of town.
Don't you show your face around here again.
- I'll try my best.
- Your best and Father Mulcahy's medal should do it.
- I never got that medal.
- You didn't?
He forget?
No, they're shipping me out early.
He's in post-op.
Want me to get him?
- Don't bother, sir.
It can wait till I'm stateside.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Take it easy.
Okay.
- Here's the lighter fluid for your lighter, Colonel.
- What it needs is lighter fluid.
- These things dry up, you know.
- It was full when you bought it.
Well, it's dry now.
And when are they fixing the P.A. System?
Probably not till tomorrow.
The electrician's resting over at Rosie's Bar.
- Resting?
- He was fixing the wires, and it shot him through the wall.
- Shocking.
-  - May I, Colonel?
- Always a pleasure to see you, Padre.
Sir, the Marsh boy left before I could replace his St. Christopher medal.
- Is there any way I can get it to him?
- Radar?
There's another ambulance leaving for the 123rd at 1400 hours, sir.
The driver could personally deliver it in person.
- Voila.
- Radar, sometimes I think you deserve a medal.
No, thank you, Father.
I'm Protestant.
- About time, Klinger.
- I've been moving my tail, sir.
We've had a rash of mysterious blowouts.
- You got a rash?
Use talcum.
- Spirits at work again?
Weird things have been happening, Father.
- Igor hasn't drawn better than two pair in poker since Friday.
- Oh, my.
And I ripped four nylons in a week.
You're giving me goose bumps.
A stray bomb comes from out of nowhere.
Blows up a shipment of chipped beef.
- What do you call that?
- A gift from heaven.
Me?
I'm playin' it safe.
See this?
This wards off evil spirits.
- A blue bead?
- I'm not wearin' it 'cause it goes well with the organdy which it does like a dream.
-  That's crazy.
- I'm not taking any chances with the evil eye.
Is there any such thing?
I came from a long line of short-nosed people.
One day my grandfather's camel spit in the eye of the village witch.
Ever since then, we've been growin' 'em like this.
Would you two please excuse me?
I have a serious technical problem to wrestle with.
Yes, sir.
And thank you, sir.
- What are you doing, Radar?
- I'm nailing up a horseshoe, sir.
I can see that.
Who asked you to?
I won it from Igor in a poker game.
He says it come off of Man o' War.
That shoe came off Cousin Elmer's plow horse.
Take it down.
- Down, sir?
- Yeah, down.
I never swallowed that bilge water about horseshoes and good luck.
And I'm not about to start.
On the other hand, it is an attractive ornament.
I kind of figured you'd kind of figure it that way, sir.
And, Radar, the end should point up, so the luck doesn't run out.
Hmm.
Stretcher bearers, on the double!
Let's see what we got here.
All right.
He's not so bad.
This one can wait.
- This one can't.
He's in shock.
Give me a unit of whole blood!
- Not Corporal Marsh again.
Corporal Flypaper.
I can't get him off my hands.
If only I'd gotten his medal to him in time.
- What happened?
- The old man stepped in front of the ambulance.
- I cut to miss him, but hit him anyway.
Wound up in a ditch.
- Put him down.
- How is he?
- He's gonna need surgery.
He's not gonna get it here.
This man's a whiplash hustler.
Frank, if he doesn't get help, he's gonna die before you can bat a whiplash.
- A whiplash hustler?
- Korea's crawling with 'em.
Step in front of a U.S. Army vehicle, fake an injury, then sue Uncle Sam for all he's got.
He's right.
Look at the fake blood.
He's a hustler.
She's an ambulance chaser.
I'm his granddaughter, Kyong Ja.
Tell the major it wasn't deliberate before he calls out a firing squad.
- But it was deliberate.
- Ha!
It's true.
Some people pretend to have accidents, as the major says.
But others are like my grandfather.
They believe they are followed by evil spirits.
Oh, yes.
They step in front of moving vehicles to scare the spirits away.
Exactly.
They also hope the driver will understand and stop in time.
- Move him into pre-op.
- You're not touching him, Pierce.
Do you read me?
Like a comic book.
Shall we?
-  -  Hey, hey.
Calm down.
He's afraid.
He wants to leave.
I'm a better surgeon than I look.
It's the spirits he fears, not you.
The only spirits around here are the ones we drink.
At his age, it's useless to reason with him.
He says, remove him.
If the evil spirits don't get him, he'll kill himself.
All right, let's get him out of here.
You know, if he doesn't get surgery, he's gonna die.
- I'm afraid it cannot be done.
Unless it's done his way.
- What's his way?
The evil spirits must be exorcised from this place.
Well, exorcise is good for you.
We'll send 'em on a five-mile hike.
- You believe in spirits too?
- I don't, but he does.
He insists on leaving and treating himself.
- With what, Chinese herbs?
- They're his traditional medicine.
All he's gonna get out of Chinese herbs is a bad cup of tea.
- He'll die before he can read the leaves.
- Could you do as he wishes?
- Exorcise the spirits?
- Yes!
I'll try anything once.
Acetyl, salicylic, phenobarb and arsphenamine.
- My God, it worked.
-  - Put a cork in that laugh, you little twerp.
- I will in a minute, sir.
- Now!
- Right.
The exorcism would have to be performed by a priestess.
Once the spirits are gone, my grandfather will let you operate.
- We haven't got time for that.
- She's only a mile away.
- I can drive her, sir.
- You do that, Radar.
You do that, and I'll have your stripes!
You look lousy in stripes, Frank.
Go ahead, Radar.
Just a minute.
U.S. Regulations do not allow for heathen rituals on government property.
Dangerous talk.
If the spirits heard you say that, they'd turn you into a pumpkin - or a dedicated doctor.
- Oh, bunko, junko.
- Run along, Radar.
- Permission to run along denied.
- Permission to deny denied.
- You can't do that.
I outrank you.
- I have half a mind to tell the colonel.
- I deny you have half a mind.
- Then I will see the colonel.
- I'll deny I said anything.
I'll deny I denied anything.
Beat it, Radar.
Pierce, you're the most unmilitary man in this man's army.
Thank you.
First, he brings in Korean civilians with unauthorized wounds.
Now he wants to drag in a pagan priestess to stir up the local spooks.
- Which I don't believe in.
- These local spooks don't spook you, do they?
Certainly not.
It's poppycock.
But, uh, why incur the wrath of the man upstairs?
Who, MacArthur?
I do not intend to idly stand by and let Captain Pierce conduct his exorcism.
Okay, you can conduct.
I'll play violin.
He's joking about me and army rules and regulations, and it isn't funny!
A comic is only as good as his material.
It's a little out of the ordinary.
I'd rather not operate on a hysterical patient.
All I wanna do is put the old man at ease.
- I didn't say no, Pierce.
- Not saying no, is that saying yes?
Yes.
Not saying no is saying yes.
But what if general staff should drop in?
What if they saw a priestess exorcising demons?
If she knows her stuff, I may have her exorcise them off the compound.
- Sir, you're not taking this seriously.
- No, I'm not.
Why are you?
Frank was once the innocent victim of possession.
Through some tragic error, they exorcised the nice guy and left that.
Sir, you can't go through with this!
Can if I want to.
And it's not you I'll apologize to.
- It's the good father.
- Why me?
It's not exactly what they told you to expect at chaplain school.
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
- Not you, Father.
- Yes, me, Major.
Why, you spiritual thrill seeker, you.
Wondrous is man and mysterious the ways of God.
And I would have no one shield my eyes from the glory of His works.
- What does that mean?
- It means there's more than one way to skin a spirit.
- Did it again.
- He's indestructible.
Not indestructible.
Young.
If the young weren't so damn good at surviving wars, maybe there wouldn't be any more.
He's stable.
No reason for you to be here, Doctor.
I'll hang around a while.
I wanna see his face when he sees me again.
- Hi.
- Captain Hunnicutt?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, no.
This is getting monotonous, isn't it?
When did I get hit?
I don't remember.
We sent you home.
Your ambulance had an accident.
- Oh, I'm back here again?
- Mm-hmm.
This is the third time.
One more, you win a solid gold jeep.
- Oh, geez.
- What?
I'm never gonna get out of here.
Marsh, you have about as much chance of dying as you have of becoming president.
- Yeah, but three times.
- You can only serve twice.
Boy.
- This is sure a lousy habit we got into.
- I'll tell you what.
After the war, you look me up.
For old times' sake, I'll take out your appendix.
-  Yeah.
- I'll see you later.
-  -  - Hey, Radar.
- What?
- What gives?
- Oh.
Hawkeye says she's an exorcist.
She's chasing away demons.
- No kidding.
What's she doing here?
- She's exorcising.
Getting all the unauthorized spirits out of the area.
I wonder if she could exorcise me back to Toledo.
I feel in better spirits already.
- I think my grandfather does too.
- When will his room be ready?
She needs more time before it's safe to enter.
- What's the hold up?
- That lady over there is trying to evict some spirits.
Doesn't have a ghost of a chance.
- Like to lend a hand, but I wouldn't know where to put it.
- Doesn't look like she needs one.
- Heard the overture.
Didn't wanna be late.
- You're early.
- The floor show doesn't start for five minutes.
- We wanted good seats.
- Would you like to order a drink?
- Negative.
Five dollar minimum.
Why waste it?
Colonel, Pierce's witch is out there attracting crowds and disrupting activity.
-  So?
- Shouldn't somebody do something?
- Yes.
Book her for the weekend and we'll sell tickets.
-  Colonel, do you know what's going on in pre-op?
You ask the Sol Hurok of Korea?
He helped arrange the whole thing.
-  -  Hell's bells.
-  I think I'm about to have a cardiac arrest.
- I'll have one too, on the rocks.
- Who invited you, Corporal Ignerts?
- Be glad I'm here, sir.
This may be all that stands between you and having your chin drop off.
Don't you love what she's wearing?
Nah.
Too pushy.
Well, Father, what's your critical opinion?
Interesting.
Sort of a cross between a bishop and a bullfighter.
-  You having a good time?
-  He says he wants us all to come up to his place for beer and kimchi after the operation.
-  - Oh, his treat.
- Tallyho.
- If you like the dancer, you'll love the surgeon.
That heathen display was ridiculous.
Did absolutely no good at all.
Attention, all personnel.
Hill 205 has been overrun.
Prepare for incoming casualties.
- I thought we lost the P.A. System.
- Oh, I forgot to say.
- The P.A. System is now working again, for some reason.
- Thank you.
That boy's gonna be awful hard to live with after this.
- Margaret, that apparatus is defective.
- There's nothing wrong with it.
-  I thought the gauge was stuck.
- It's not stuck now.
Hold me.
I'm scared.
There must be some logical explanation.
- If there is, you'll never find it.
- I don't follow you.
- Look at that.
- That?
Why, that's nothing.
Probably never happen again.
In about a week, I'll drop in to see him.
- Meantime, make sure he eats and gets plenty of rest.
- Yes, Doctor.
If he's followed by spirits, tell him not to jump in front of a car unless it's parked.
- Here, Doctor.
A gift.
- Oh, thank you.
- Just what I needed.
- Not for exorcism.
For decoration.
I'll use it to chase away the blues, or the olive drabs.
- Good-bye, Doctor, and thank you.
- Good-bye, Kyong Ja.
I don't care if the P.A. Is in working order.
I want somebody to check it out, pronto.
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
- Radar, you better put the spirit post back where it was.
- Yes, Colonel.
Um, I already did.
- Well, this is it.
- You said that before.
- But this "this is it" is it.
- Yeah, I hope.
- Oh, Father.
- Yeah?
Oh, yes.
Here.
May God and a smooth ride go with you.
- Thanks.
- Break a leg.
Thanks a lot!
St. Christopher gets all the breaks.
What's the matter, Frank?
This goldarned radio was working a minute ago.
- The evil spirits are back.
They hate radios.
- Try your bells on it, Hawk.
That's a lot of monkey doodle.
Oh, really?
Would you like to make a little wager?
Say five bucks?
Oh, let's say ten, huh?
You're on.
-  -  Excuse me, Major Burns.
Colonel Potter wants to see you in his office about the duty roster.
On my way.
Ten bucks, please.
Wait a minute.
Give me a chance, will ya?
It takes a little longer with a cheap radio.
##  Ten bucks.
Lucky stiff.
Wow.
That stuff really works, huh?
It's easy.
You just gotta shake the bells a few times And, uh, put the plug back in.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
-  Clamp.
Look at them.
They're babies.
- What are you talking about?
The patients, Frank.
Look at their faces.
They couldn't ante up a whisker between them.
-  Beards don't prove anything.
-  Remember.
You heard it here first.
- Litter!
-  It's not what's on their chins, but what's in their guts.
Which is mostly shrapnel.
Frank started out to be a psychiatrist, but he discovered he likes the sight of blood.
Oh, hardy-har-har.
These men are soldiers, Pierce - and darn proud of it.
- No, they're not.
They're babies.
Look at this Timothy Burke.
Can't be more than 18 years old.
He ought to be home being burped by his mother.
We're all a bunch of pediatricians.
All except you, Frank.
Oh?
And what am I?
Well?
Don't rush me.
I'm still working on it.
Tsk.
Clumsy oaf.
And no prompting from the studio audience, please.
Babies.
You okay, Hawk?
I'm going out.
"Wondering where they went.
And so the" Oh, Hawkeye.
I'm on my way to a root beer float.
Look at that daffy dan.
I thought he was supposed to be so exhausted.
Tomcatting around as usual.
Probably on the prowl for that Nurse Able.
Able and willing is the way I hear it.
It's possible, Frank, that Captain Pierce just is trying to unwind.
- After all, he did put in a 19-hour day.
- And what about me?
- You slept.
- I took a nap.
- Eight hours, Frank, is not a nap.
- So sue me.
- The alarm didn't go off.
- Sure, Frank.
Well, it was still a long day.
- I'm human.
- Oh?
I need to unwind too.
Margaret, I'm as taut as a watch spring.
Your state of tautness is no longer a concern of mine, Major Burns.
I happen to be an engaged person.
- Oh, that scent.
What is it?
- Forbidden Furlough.
- Eight dollars an ounce.
- Oh, it's worth it.
It's driving me mad.
It's not intended to do that, Major Burns.
- It's to remind me of him.
- Oh, Margaret, I ache for you.
I yearn for you.
- You're everything beautiful and fine and noble in this world.
- Uh-huh.
You're the moon, the sun, the stars in heaven.
- You make the angels feel unworthy.
- Frank, really!
I know God exists because you exist.
I belong to him.
You better than anyone ought to know.
- I'm a one-man woman.
- You're all woman.
Lieutenant Colonel Penobscott's all man.
You smell like a French hooker.
- Hiya, Scooter.
- "Scooter"?
- Look at my new tennis shoes.
- Your new what?
I feel so light.
I feel like I could run forever.
I feel so free.
I know what you mean.
I get that feeling with a pair of new pumps.
Ain't you tired, Captain?
You were in the O.R. All day and half the night.
- What do you think of our new principal, Mr. Vanderhaven?
- Who?
I like your new BB gun.
My dad won't let me get one.
- See ya, Scoot.
- Oh!
Get some sleep, Captain.
- Hi.
- Hi, Hawkeye.
- You wanna go down to the park and play ball?
- No, I think not, Hawkeye.
- It's a little late to play ball.
- Okay.
- Strike out?
- Nobody to play with.
You screwball.
Right in front of Nurse Ripley.
Next time you're in the mood to play ball, wait till she goes on duty.
- You tired?
- What's beyond tired?
-  Exhausted?
- What comes after that?
- Dead?
- Now you're gettin' warm.
What do you expect, wandering around the compound half the night?
- What's he talking about?
- I guess he's talking about your midnight stroll.
- Now what are you talking about?
-  Hey, Captain.
No foolin'.
You were playing basketball sort of.
Don't Don't pull my leg.
The shape I'm in, it'll come off.
You were telling me about your new tennis shoes.
- What tennis shoes?
- You were wearing boots but you were talking about this great pair of tennies you got.
Then you asked me about some guy named Vander-something-or-other.
I don't know any Vander-something.
You said he was the new principal.
What is it, son?
Vanderhaven.
He's talking about Clarence Vanderhaven.
I just got a cold shiver down my back.
Me too.
You must have been sleepwalking.
- I don't sleepwalk.
I mean, I never have.
- How do you know?
That's right.
You may have even performed surgery in your sleep.
The voice of experience.
I'm sure it's nothing to be overly concerned about, Hawkeye.
You've just been working too hard.
You're not worried about anything special, are you?
Me worry?
What have I got to worry about?
Except the chance I may go to sleep tonight in the Swamp and wake up tomorrow morning strolling through downtown Peking.
I was playing basketball?
Yeah.
But on the bright side, you weren't bad.
Would you believe that two years ago I never even heard of Korea?
Me neither, but then, uh, geography was never my strong subject.
- Where are you from?
- Crabapple Cove, Maine.
- You probably heard of it.
- That sounds nice.
Like a place where Winnie-the-Pooh hangs out.
It was a great place to be a kid.
There was a stream with fish in it that ran right behind the house.
More trees than you could climb in a lifetime.
And in the fall, when the leaves began to turn you couldn't believe the beauty.
It was as if God had invented new colors just for the occasion.
- What about the people?
- They never changed color.
Always the same.
Off-white.
Come on.
What are they like?
The best.
The greatest man I ever knew was born there.
He never wanted to live anywhere else.
- Who's that?
- My dad.
- How long since you've seen him?
- A lifetime.
Two years.
- Did you lose something, sir?
- Hi, Stinky.
Uh, sir, that's the sort of name that kind of sticks with a fella.
I'd appreciate it if you'd just call me by my given nickname.
What's cooking, Dexter?
If those are my only choices, I guess I'll take Stinky.
It's got a little more pizzazz.
- What?
- He's at it again.
- Waah!
-  What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
-  He's asleep.
- Oh, go on.
- Hawkeye, you asleep?
- Don't wake him.
He'll get lockjaw.
Before I'm through, I'm gonna own every purie in Crabapple Cove.
-  That's spooky!
- Help me get him back to bed.
Right.
- What a shot!
I'm gonna clean up.
-  Here we go.
-  Careful, sir.
- Did you see that?
You see that shot?
- Right.
- What a shot.
Hey, Stinky.
- What?
- Do me a favor, will ya?
Get my marbles.
If I leave them out there, somebody's gonna swipe 'em.
- Right.
- Come on, Hawkeye.
Just a bit further.
- What a shot.
-  Easy now.
Relax.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Come on, Stinky.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I swallowed   Watch it!
- Toby!
Toby, the trees!
- Hawk!
Hawkeye!
- What?
What?
What?
- It's all right.
It's just a dream.
It's okay.
You're having a bad dream.
- Oh, God.
That was awful.
- What was it?
Oh, God.
What a dream!
- Who's Toby?
- Toby.
Toby Wilder.
My He's my best friend.
We w When we were kids, he and I and Dickie Barber were the Three Musketeers.
I saw us riding our sleds down Hermitage Hill.
We were just kids.
We were, like, 11 or 12.
And, uh He was go He was going way too fast.
He was li completely out of control.
It was as if the snow had turned to ice.
And he was heading for the trees.
And he kept screaming my name.
"Hawkeye!
Hawkeye"!
It's just a dream, Hawk.
Yeah, sure.
Just a dream.
Only I'm shaking like a leaf.
My heart's pounding as if I've run 10 miles.
My palms are sweaty.
And I'm not sure, but I think I wet the bed.
That dream could have been a warning, a premonition.
- I don't believe in that stuff.
- Some people have extrasensory perception.
I knew you were gonna say that.
Seriously.
Have you a more logical explanation?
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.
Are you forgetting I'm a doctor as well as a card-carrying skeptic?
- I don't believe most of what I can see, let alone what I can't.
- So what's your explanation?
There's no reason to make a big deal out of a little sleepwalking and one nightmare.
I agree.
And I wouldn't if it were happening to anyone else.
It's tension.
You've been working too hard, and you're not sleeping.
Yeah.
The only green vegetables I get are martini olives.
What do I expect?
Exactly.
Frankly, I think I'm pregnant.
I also think I'm gonna call Toby Wilder.
Not because I believe in any of that clairvoyant stuff.
Just because I want to chat with an old friend, see how he's doing, see how the kids are and if it should come up in conversation, find out if he's been killed on a sled recently.
Toby, you were flying down Hermitage Hill and you were heading right for that big oak, you know?
And you kept ca No, really.
No.
Really.
You kept calling my name.
Uh, huh?
No, I don't owe you 37 bucks.
Listen, the Toby, I do not owe you $37.
Listen to me, will ya?
The sled was Toby, li The Tob Yes.
I borrowed the money.
I admit that.
But I paid you back years ago.
Why would I lie?
Okay, Toby.
Fine, fine.
If that's how you feel about it, come over here and collect.
Next time he gets on a sled, it better not be in my dream.
## - How can you be so sure you paid him?
- Because I always pay my debts.
Except for Nudist Quarterly.
I ordered that in Frank's name.
But the point is, I was calling and all he could do was gripe about 37 lousy dollars.
What's 11,000 miles got to do with anything?
People always talk about long-distance phone calls like they had to walk all the way.
That's true.
You know, Klinger, you're not just another pretty face.
- You're definitely not just another pretty face.
- Thank you.
Good night, all.
Sleep tight.
- I think I'll tuck it in too.
- What's your hurry?
What's with you?
Are you giving up sleep for Lent?
There's no point in going to bed.
I'll just be up playing basketball in five minutes.
Come on.
Stick around.
I'll buy you a drink.
Good night, Captain.
That's easy for you to say.
- Hey, how goes it, Frank?
- What?
- Life.
- Life?
Yeah.
Everything turning out the way you wanted?
Are your dreams, aspirations and fantasies shaping up?
- You woke me up.
- Well, God knows I've tried.
Are you nutsy?
I was sleeping.
- Yeah.
Don't rub it in.
- Why did you wake me up?
'Cause I'm interested in you, Frank.
- Tell me about your hometown.
- It's Fort Wayne.
What's it to ya?
I hear Fort Wayne is the Brussels of the Midwest.
Tell me about the people.
- All of them.
- You're crazy, Pierce.
- You wanna hear about my hometown?
- No.
Crabapple Cove.
First settled in the year 1684.
Population: 3,976.
Fort Wayne's bigger than that.
Yeah.
You ever been afraid to go to sleep at night, Frank?
- Of course not.
- Even as a kid?
Well, I had a Popeye night-light when I was little.
My dad took it away.
He said it was dark 12 hours out of every 24 and he wouldn't put up with a son who was a coward half the time.
- He took away your night-light?
- It's no big deal.
There's nothing in the dark that's not there in the light.
Why do I find no comfort in that thought?
Popeye, where are you when I need you?
- Radar, I gotta call Crabapple Cove.
- Huh?
I just had a dream.
Dickie Barber an explosion.
- He was blown into a million pieces.
- Wow!
A million pieces.
Get up.
I gotta call him.
I gotta find out if he's okay.
I gotta warn him.
Right.
He wants me to call Dickie Barber.
I gotta hear his voice.
I gotta make sure.
- Place the call, Radar.
- Yes, sir.
- Anything I can do, son?
- No.
It'll take time for Radar to get through.
Why don't you lie down for a little while?
Sparky.
When Hawkeye's finished, I want you to place a second call.
- Who to?
- Dr. Sidney Freedman.
- The psychiatrist?
- Shh.
Yes, sir.
He's fine.
Dickie Barber's just fine.
- My hometown's gonna think I turned into a ghoul.
- Come on.
You dream a couple of friends are in danger and you figure you might do some good warning them.
I don't think Crabapple Cove is gonna banish you for that.
- I think I'm cracking up.
- Hawk.
No, I'm not kidding.
How long can a person live without sleep?
Two weeks, but you gotta keep dancing.
I'm scared.
We're sitting in the middle of a war.
You're supposed to be scared.
It's normal.
- No, not this scared.
Not this way.
- What's different?
It's one thing to live in a shooting gallery but now I'm being attacked from inside.
I'm afraid to lie down in my sack.
I'm afraid to close my eyes.
How do I defend myself from myself?
Thanks, Doc.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Bye.
- What's the matter with Hawkeye, sir?
- I don't know, Radar.
Oh, gee.
I thought he was doing okay fighting against the war.
You mean fighting the war, don't you?
No, sir.
I mean the war against the war.
You know.
We all fight it.
You fight it by, uh, painting and riding your horse and I fight it by working hard and taking care of my animals.
Yeah.
- That makes sense.
- Yes, sir, but, uh Well, Hawkeye's really fought it.
I mean, he's made fun of it.
He knew it was awful, but but he never let it get him.
He never backed down.
They oughta give him a medal for the way he's fought this war.
The worse it got, the the more he joked about it.
And now the jokes aren't working anymore.
- No, sir.
The other side's winning.
- It hasn't won yet.
Once upon a time, a kid named David went up against a heavy favorite named Goliath - and decked him.
- I know about that, sir.
But David wasn't afraid to fall asleep at night.
- I'm out.
- Me too.
- That's what I thought.
- Is He ever wrong?
Only when it comes to poker.
I believe you, Radar.
I'm going out and I'm taking my measly pair of nines with me.
- You win, Radar.
- Geez, all I had was a pair of sevens.
-  - Sorry, Hawkeye.
Who'd have thought it would come to this.
Radar not only bluffs me out of a pot, he pities me besides.
- I'm going out for some air.
-  Mind if I tag along?
Fine with me, Doc.
As long as your couch has wheels on it.
Okay.
Seven card high-low, deuces wild, high spade in the hole.
How's it going?
Well, you is the cuckoo expert.
I'm just a cuckoo.
- Potter call you?
- Would you be upset if he had?
No.
I'd appreciate his concern.
I'm just here to play a little poker, have a couple of drinks and figure out the meaning of life.
- Sidney, I'm afraid to go to sleep.
- So I hear.
And they tell me I've been playing a mean game of zombie basketball.
They tell me you've been worrying about losing your marbles.
Ah, very good.
For my next trick I'll invent sibling rivalry.
Tell me, what's happening, Sidney?
I'm scared sick.
Why do I sleepwalk?
Why do I have these terrible nightmares?
I see old pals as clearly as I see you, and they're getting zapped.
And then I call the States, and they're home watching Milton Berle.
If this keeps up, people are gonna realize I'm as crazy as I think I am.
What do you think?
I think I'd like to sit down.
Tell me, Sidney, has my little red choo-choo gone chugging around the bend?
You amateurs just can't resist tossing around that psychoanalytical jargon.
Okay.
Have it your way.
Has my, uh, trolley been derailed?
Am I playing with half a deck?
Am I driving without my headlights?
That's better.
So you've been walking in your sleep.
What do you think it means?
I'm walking.
I'm, uh, uh I'm walking towards something.
- I'm walking away from something.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm trying to escape.
In other words, you go to sleep, your subconscious takes a little walk and brings your body along for company.
Yeah, well, I don't seem to be getting very far.
You're making it all the way back to Crabapple Cove.
All the way back to a time when playing ball and shooting marbles and going on picnics were all there was to worry about.
No more responsibility.
No more life and death decisions.
And pain was a skinned knee.
What about my nightmares?
What about them?
I keep having these dreams about these these kids I grew up with.
And l The The dreams start out okay.
The kids are fine.
And then they end in disaster.
Like those kids who roll past you on that bloody assembly line.
You dream to escape, but the war invades your dream, and you wake up screaming.
The dream is peaceful.
Reality is the nightmare.
Am I crazy, Sidney?
No.
A bit confused, a little "furshimmeled" is all.
Actually, Hawkeye, you're probably the sanest person I've ever known.
The fact is, if you were crazy, you'd sleep like a baby.
So when do my nightmares end?
When this big one ends, most of the others should go away.
But there's a lot of suffering going on here, Hawkeye, and you can't avoid it.
You can't even dream it away.
You're very reassuring, Sidney.
You got a heck of a "warside" manner.
Let's cut out this kid stuff and play some ball.
- Ooh.
- Hey.
You're pretty bad.
-  - Come here.
Look at that, will ya?
Is it any wonder I can't get a Section Eight?
In this outfit, you wanna be crazy, you gotta stand in line.
- Do you think it's gonna work?
- Come again.
Is Freedman buying it?
- "It"?
- The shtick.
The routine.
Listen, I've been kicking myself for not coming up with it on my own.
It's beautiful.
A little basketball, a little marbles a little bloodcurdling scream in the dead of night.
I doff my chapeau.
It's subtle.
It's artistic.
And, best of all, you don't have to worry about the fickle whims of fashion.
True, Klinger, but then I'll never know the rapture of the warm, lingering looks that follow you constantly.
I suppose.
It is an act, isn't it?
Mais oui, Josephine.
I'm as sane as you.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Staff duty log, 13 June Corporal Walter O'Reilly, company clerk, 0600 hours.
The friendly old sun showed his friendly hot face over the mountains of purple majesty as though he was salutating, "Good morning to all".
Alas, alack, the peaceful quietness was detonated by a herd of chopper transportizing punctured personnel.
But our gallant doctors, the miracle medical mortals are ever ready to treat the sick.
The wounded were aided copiously by super-smart surgeons The wounded were aided copiously by super-smart surgeons whose knowledge is superseded by nobody I know.
Together or apart, they work as a team.
Skilled hands with their fingers work dedicatedly to keep death away from its maximum.
- Radar, what is this cow flubdubbery?
- Sir?
All this "miracle medical mortals" hooey.
What are you doin' to my duty log?
I was just adding a hint of self-expression, sir.
Better fill me in, son, and use simple sentences.
Well, sir, I've been accepted by the famous Las Vegas Writers' School.
"Serving the creative community since 1950".
- Right.
- How'd you stumble onto this?
- Superman, sir.
- He take the course?
No, sir.
On the back of his comic book.
See, right next to the ad for the X-ray glasses?
I sent 'em in an example of my writings and they said that I had "extraordinary potential".
- How much they stick you for?
- Just $50 plus a five-dollar student activity fee, but it's really worth it.
They show you all the writers' secrets, like verbs and semicolons and all that good stuff.
Sounds like the original shell game to me.
Oh, no, it's no game, sir.
This school is run by some very famous writers like Hemingway and Steinbeck and O'Neill.
"Ethel Hemingway, Jerry Steinbeck, Eunice O'Neill".
- Right.
- Uh-huh.
Look at page three.
"Writers are special people.
In a crowd, they are glib and articulate.
Everyone respects the man who writes well".
Can you imagine, sir?
In just 10 weeks, I can be respected by a crowd.
An admirable goal, Radar.
But the army doesn't need creative writing.
- Save it for your novel.
- Thank you, sir.
- I'll dedicate my first book after you.
- Better let me read it first.
Ah, foot fault!
Your foot left the court.
You don't get the point.
- It never touched the floor.
- Come on, Pancho.
I saw it hit.
- What's the difference?
- I'm gonna get a ruling on this.
Frank, did you see his foot leave the bunk?
- Earth calling Major Burns.
- You want something, Pierce?
- What's so absorbing, Junior?
- It's an interesting article about Sweden.
- Learning to be a meatball?
- I'm reading about their rising suicide rate.
- Just killing time?
- Go peddle your petunias.
Here.
You ready for my killer serve?
- This has been clocked at over five miles an hour.
- Lay it on me.
Twenty-one!
On to Wimbledon!
I'm This must be the press asking me how it feels to be a winner.
- Go ahead.
Ask me how it feels.
- How do you feel, sir?
What a stupid question.
Cancel the interview.
- Actually, I come in here to ask you two guys a favor.
- What is it, Radar?
Well, uh, you see, I, uh I found this real neat way to improve myself.
- Don't change a hair for me.
- Not if you care for me.
I enrolled in this writers' school by mail.
- They send you tiny teachers in little envelopes?
- For short stories?
Come on, guys.
I'm having trouble with my first assignment.
I have to relate an amusing anecdote, and I don't think I ever had an anecdote.
- Not even a small one?
- I have some in my footlocker.
What size do you wear?
- Come on.
Will ya?
- I got an amusing anecdote, but promise you won't laugh.
Okay, fine.
Yeah, good.
Here.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- This happened while I was in my first year of medical school.
- Right.
I was taking an exam in anatomy.
It was really tough.
They asked questions like, "How many bones are there in the hand"?
I was stymied.
I kept saying to myself, "How many bones are there in the hand"?
And then I heard this little voice that said, "Twenty-four".
I looked around the room, and there sitting over on the windowsill was this little gray squirrel with a very intelligent face.
And he pointed at his hand, and he said, "Twenty-four".
So I wrote it down.
Then after the exam, I rushed over to the library to look it up.
And would you believe it?
That stupid squirrel was wrong by four bones!
I went looking all over the campus for him.
I wanted to kill him.
And I finally found him over on a bench by the psych department.
"You were wrong"!
I screamed at him.
"There's 28 bones in the human hand"!
"Oh," he said, pointing at his hand.
"I thought you meant a squirrel's hand".
I don't think I can use that story.
Do you want me to make one up?
Frank, help us out.
We need a funny anecdote.
- I don't feel very funny.
- Aw, come on.
Be a pal.
- Please, sir?
Would you, please?
- Well  There's one that always breaks me up.
Seems we had this little sickly kid that lived on our block named Timmy.
He used to sit out on his porch in his wheelchair and wave at us as we walked by.
Sort of Well, one day while he was waving, he lost control of his chair and it rolled down the stairs, across the lawn and crashed into my dad's car.
Boy, was that funny!
- That must have been awful.
- No, just scratched the paint a little.
- I hope Timmy wasn't hurt.
- What's the difference?
His folks had money.
Frank, that was not an amusing anecdote.
You guys have got no sense of humor.
All you know how to do is pick, pick, pick.
Is there anything I can do to please you?
- Tap dance in the minefield.
- Drop yourself on North Korea.
Oh, fish.
That's the last time I tell a joke to you guys.
Maybe I should just go to assignment number two.
Let's see.
Uh, "Describe a beautiful scene outside your window".
- Maybe assignment number three.
- Radar, why the sudden interest in creative writing?
Oh, I need it.
You see, more and more, a man is judged by how good he expresses himself.
- Where'd you get that?
- Page five.
What do you mean you're out of tapioca pudding?
I saw some enlisted men eating some!
That's why we're out, Major.
They ate it all.
Well, it's not fair.
You run this place like a bunch of babies.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, you should be.
It's my birthday.
And I always have tapioca pudding on my birthday.
How was I supposed to know?
- Well, you could have asked.
- Happy birthday, Major.
Never mind.
You spoiled it for me.
And I hope you're satisfied.
Would you like an extra hunk of liver?
Soldier, I'm confiscating this tapioca.
I wouldn't do that if I were you, sir.
Don't threaten me.
Mmm, with raisins.
No, sir.
Flies.
Some birthday this turned out to be.
Why, Frank, you didn't tell us it was your birthday.
It's not important.
What's the difference?
Nobody cares.
You're being too hard on yourself, Frank.
Here, I'll prove it to you.
Hey, everybody, guess what.
Today's Major Burns's birthday.
- See?
- They're delighted.
- Birthdays are hell.
- So are wars, but we keep on celebrating them every year.
Who cares about wars?
This really hurts.
Maybe we should take up a collection and get him a gift.
What can you buy for a dime?
I know, I know.
Everything looks so good.
- What'll you have?
- I'll have a modicum of hash and a smattering of potatoes.
- You been out in the sun again?
- No.
I'm adding muscle to my vocabulary.
- I'm taking this correspondence course by mail.
- Oh, yeah?
These mail things are great.
My friend Vito met his wife that way.
- She was a pen pal?
- No.
She was a mailman.
- What a provocative anecdote.
- Watch your mouth!
Uh, Father, excuse me.
Do you mind if I sit here?
Certainly not, Radar.
Father, do you have a most unforgettable character?
- Oh, your writing class, eh?
- Yes, sir.
Well, without a doubt, I'd have to name my sister, Sister Theresa.
She's a Benedictine in San Diego.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, sir.
Oh, no.
She teaches in the seminary there.
She also plays guard on their basketball team.
You know, she can slam dunk while wearing a heavy crucifix.
Oh, now we're getting somewhere!
This used to be the most important day of the year for me.
I looked forward to it for months.
There used to be parties in my honor.
Cards, gifts and What do I get around here, huh?
Nothing.
Nada.
Zilch.
Zippo.
The big goose egg.
And look at you.
You got a Purple Heart, and it's not even your birthday.
What is it?
What do you want?
- Nothing, Frank.
- We came to work.
- Oh, sure.
Came in to spy on me.
- We came to relieve you.
I didn't do anything wrong.
And you keep your hands off his Purple Heart!
And that was one of his more lucid moments.
Why don't we shoot him and put him out of our misery?
- That or just find something to lift his spirits.
- Call off the peace talks.
Have Margaret's fiance transferred to the European theater.
Get him a seat in the balcony.
You and I could have a fight and beat each other's brains out.
- Frank would love that.
- Right.
That would give Frank instant joy, to see us at each other's throats.
- Let's do it.
- It is the perfect gift for the man who has nothing.
We'd have to be pretty convincing.
It's easy to fake a fight with a jerk like you.
Nah.
Who'd believe I couldn't take a noodle like you out with one punch?
- Maybe you ought to fight Radar.
- This is gonna be the best birthday of Frank's whole life.
I don't wanna hear about it!
I gave you your assignment, and that's that!
- Why don't you work the shift with me?
- Because I'm chief surgeon.
- If you don't like it, join another army.
- What's going on, fellas?
It's a good thing we're friends.
Otherwise, you'd have me on duty 24 hours.
- That can be arranged, buster.
- This isn't a fight, is it?
- Don't turn your back on me.
- How you gonna work with your nose in a sling?
- Boys, easy.
- I'm not working the shift alone, Pierce!
- I'm gonna let Frank decide.
- Leave me out of it.
I like the way you guys are working it out.
- I'm gonna see what the colonel has to say about this.
- Oh, sure, the colonel.
- Wow, you guys are really mad at each other.
- You think you know a guy.
- All of a sudden, he pulls rank.
- What a shame.
- Some friend.
The guy's a two-faced rat!
- That's pretty strong.
- How would you put it?
- Well, maybe you're right.
He's so competitive, so childish.
Always has to come out on top, get in the last word.
- I know.
Impossible.
- He's impossible!
Here he comes.
Let's pretend we're talking about him, okay?
You're lucky, Hunnicutt.
Potter's taking a nap.
Forget it.
I'd rather work the shift alone than be stuck in here with you!
You The air feels better in here already!
Don't you wanna tell Potter?
Wake him up.
He won't mind.
- Don't worry.
That lazy crumb will get his.
- I'll be a witness.
- I'll bet he called me every name in the book.
- Let's see.
Two-faced, rat fink and, uh, ferret face.
- He called me ferret face?
- He was so mad, he thought you were me.
- That's his style.
- He called you a sore loser.
- Sore loser?
- He thinks you're too competitive.
You know, hate to lose, always have to get in the last word, childish.
- He said that?
- Yeah, every syllable.
But you didn't hear it from me.
Boy, he must really be desperate.
That is so dumb, it's ridiculous.
- I hate to lose?
He said that?
- Uh-huh.
Sixteen hundred hours.
The sun in its crimson radiance bids a crepuscular adieu to another day.
Corporal Klinger was in his last grisly hour of guard duty little knowing the fate that destiny had planned up for him.
The Chinese were giving up in hordes.
Sergeant Fierman brought in three prisoners that he had captured after they had surrendered voluntarily.
The sergeant bragadeered to Corporal Klinger that capturing prisoners meant points towards discharge and early homeward bounding.
This information inspired Klinger a whole lot.
The vainglorious corporal ran like a bird and sped off in quest of Chinese giver-uppers.
But destiny exterminated his luck.
The Chinese G.I.s had not seen women in an overexcited period of time.
Klinger barely escaped with his purity still clean and in the process, ruining his finest frockery.
The corporal re-arrived with his dignity dented and his nonchalantness not so nifty.
Enough, boy!
Enough!
This whole unit is gonna get a Section Eight.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I need the practice.
Radar, duty logs have got to be military.
If headquarters sees this, they'll rip off my epaulets.
- Won't happen again, sir.
- Thank goodness.
But, Colonel, what is your actual civilian opinion of my writing?
Son, Ethel Hemingway may say I'm wrong but I don't think too much of it.
- Why, sir?
- 'Cause none of that's you.
It sounds like you swallowed a dictionary.
But I'm just doing what the book says.
Throw the book away!
I'm no authority but it seems to me the first rule if you wanna be a writer is be yourself.
Be yourself.
Must come later.
- What are you doing out here?
- Waiting for a ride home.
You ought to see Frank.
He's a new man.
Good.
I didn't like the old one.
It's good to hear him laughing in the morgue again.
Which one of us you think is gonna get the Oscar?
Me, I hope.
You know how much I hate to lose.
- Right.
- Did you really say that to Frank?
Yeah.
I was just looking for something to knock you with.
It really bugs you when I call you on foot faults, doesn't it?
- Are you kidding?
- Why else would you say I hate to lose?
I don't know.
It just popped into my head.
You really do think I'm too competitive, that I always have to get the last word in?
- Well, yeah.
- You don't know me very well, do you?
- Maybe I know you better than you think I do.
- You think so?
- I always have to get the last word in?
- That's right.
- I can prove to you - Come on!
Just say something and walk away.
All right.
- I think you're a very competitive person.
- Fine.
- You just did it.
- Did what?
Just got in the last word.
- That doesn't count.
- Then don't say anything.
- Okay.
- You're impossible.
- I'm impossible?
- Yes.
Shut up, close your mouth.
- Don't say another word.
- Okay.
Not another word!
- No problem.
- It's no use!
Wrong.
Oh.
Major Houlihan, ma'am.
- Can I ask you a question?
- You just did.
No.
It's for my writing course.
Ma'am, I have to write about a romantic interlude and I don't think I ever had one.
- What makes you think I have?
- Well, everyone knows that you're engaged.
Yes, of course.
And Lieutenant Colonel Donald Penobscott is the most romantic man I've ever met.
Right.
Well, may I ask then, have you and him ever interluded?
- Many times.
- Oh.
I remember once, we were sipping wine in a restaurant in Tokyo and a man came by our table a big man, must have weighed 250 pounds.
And he brushed my leg.
Naturally, I was alarmed and I screamed.
And Donald, without any thought to his personal safety got up and he was ready to punch that man in the mouth.
Oh, that's terrific.
What happened?
- He got bit in the leg.
- The guy bit him?
No, no, the man's Seeing Eye dog.
What the devil's he up to now?
I wouldn't stick around unless I had a strong stomach.
Oh, my.
He's gonna immolate himself.
- Oh!
- Hold on, son.
Don't do that.
Too late, Colonel.
I'm finally gonna get my discharge.
I'm going home in a butt can.
Just think about what you're doing, boy.
Here, toss me those matches.
So long, war.
Good-bye, K.P. Adios, Korea.
Sprinkle my ashes over Toledo.
Klinger, put down those matches.
- We can work this out.
- What he said.
- What's the use, Colonel?
- Well, give me a chance!
- Come on over to my office.
- Over to the office.
Well, okay.
Save my spot.
Good choice, son.
- Hurry it up, Colonel.
I'm a busy man.
- Relax, Klinger.
Where's the fire?
Sorry.
I'll take anything you got honorable, general, medical, whatever.
I appreciate how much you hate this place but you've gotta understand, it's not in my power.
I understand only one thing you're gonna give me a discharge or poof!
Klinger, I wanna help, but I can't send you home.
Did you ever see a Lebanese go up in flames?
It's not pretty.
Would you settle for some time back in Seoul?
Uh-uh.
Freedom or fire.
Anything but a free ride.
You're a tough cookie, Sherm, but you're not as tough as me.
I hope you can live with yourself.
- Klinger, please.
- Remember me at your next weenie roast.
Klinger, what am I gonna tell your wife?
Tell her I'd like to be kept in a blue jar.
That's my best color.
Son, you'll regret this for the rest of your life.
I shall not return.
Shall I pour?
Who put gasoline in my gasoline?
Stay away from me with that cigar!
Everybody, back!
Don't anybody light a match!
##  - Having a good time, Frank?
- Well, I'm the birthday boy.
Evening, Captains, Major.
- What are you doing in here?
- Come to find somebody smart to help me with my studies.
- Don't look at me.
- How's the writing going, Radar?
Col.
Potter says that I should just be myself, but I don't know how to do that.
It's simple.
Stop using fancy words.
Stop trying to find amusing anecdotes and write about something you wanna write about.
- Like what?
- Like Iowa or your animals or your Uncle Ed.
- Something you feel strongly about.
- Strongly?
Like if I were gonna write, I'd probably write about how easily friends can turn on you.
Friends will kill you every time.
- I don't think I understand.
- People forget about loyalty.
They forget you shouldn't make up vicious rumors about somebody while his back is turned.
I'd write about being too suspicious and resentful.
- How about maligning a person's character?
- What?
- Overreacting, always trying to get in the last word.
- Right.
- See?
- No.
- This is all good stuff, guys.
- Hey, wait a second.
I think I found something that I feel strongly about.
- How do you feel about shutting up?
- You know, my chest feels tight.
- What's the matter?
- It's you two guys fighting.
It makes me sick.
Don't you know that I come in here to the Swamp to feel good, have a little laugh?
It's because you two guys get along so good.
- Those days are over now.
Get out of here.
- Go on, Radar.
Well, it's just you two guys are terrific the way you work together and laugh together and stick together.
I know you're always fooling around, but you're always there when the other guy needs ya.
- Now you're getting mushy.
- No, I'm not.
A lot of guys in the army say they're friends, but these guys really are.
Except for now.
Yeah, well we're not really that mad at each other, Radar.
- Are we?
- Nah.
- We're just play acting.
- We just wanted to give Frank a birthday present.
- We wanted to make him happy.
- We were fighting to entertain you, Frank.
And it was wonderful!
I loved it!
Party's over, Frank.
Happy birthday.
It's your fault, you little creep!
You little buttinsky!
They were doing just fine till you stuck your nose in here!
- I was trying to improve myself.
- Improving yourself is a waste of time.
- Frank should know.
He gave up long ago.
- Geez, it was going so well too.
A perfectly good birthday shot to hell!
Boy!
Here.
- I'll buy you a drink.
- Thanks.
- Here's to you, Radar.
- One of a kind.
So are you two.
You still love me for all my faults?
- What faults?
You're perfect.
- Just for that, I'm gonna let you get the last word in.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Dear Mom, I gave up on the writing course on account of I found out I can write better as myself than Hemingway, O'Neill or any of those other bums.
And it doesn't cost me anything.
Give my love to everybody, especially my nephews.
Simplistically yours Walter.
And now, from Ottumwa, Iowa, deep in the mysterious Midwest the world's first magician/clerk/typist the amazing Radaro.
The hand is quicker than the eye.
-  Oh, a rabbit.
- No.
Flowers.
- You could have fooled me.
- There's a trick to that.
Now, would a gentleman or a lady in the audience please lend me their watch?
- Use Frank's.
- All right.
Sir, would you please place your watch in this cloth?
We have the cloth and a hammer.
- And now - He will destroy the watch.
I've seen this.
There's nothing to it.
He slipped the watch into his pocket when we weren't looking.
-  - Sir, I think we made a little mistake.
You little creep!
You wrecked it!
I got this from one of my whiplash patients.
Smashing trick, Radar.
This watch was worth I'm just a beginner.
Time for your next trick, Radar vanish into thin air.
- Right.
- Corporal!
It was just a rehearsal!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Okay, it's your turn.
Tell me a fantasy.
Picture, if you will a crisp winter afternoon.
You by a crackling fire in a smoking jacket.
Mmm.
What color?
Red with blue satin lapels.
- Mmm.
- And a zipper down the back.
- What for?
- You'll see.
There's a light tapping at the door.
"Who's there"?
you say, checking your zipper.
You saunter to the door, straightening your ascot and casually slide back the bolt.
Come on!
Who is it?
- Lana Turner.
- Wearing?
An angora sweater with a zipper down the back.
- What for?
- You'll see.
Go on.
She throws her arms around you.
But you push her away!
I push her away?
For what?
Your smoking jacket is covered with angora lint.
In a fit of pique, she leaves.
That's it?
The end?
- That's it.
- But what about the zippers down the back?
- They didn't catch on.
- Oh, I don't believe it!
I had Lana Turner in a fantasy with a sweater with a zipper down the back and I let her get away?
- You always were short on zip.
-  Then the colonel said, "Whatever you do, don't tell Burns".
- What?
What?
What?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Frank.
I promised.
Why don't you guys like me, huh?
Because you're a lousy doctor and a rotten person.
- Aside from that.
- Well, there's your pimples.
My pores won't close!
Aw, come on, guys.
I'll show you my present.
- Show us your present first.
- Okay.
You see?
You roll the B.B.'s around and you try and get 'em in the holes.
Now tell me what the colonel said not to tell me.
He asked Father Mulcahy to pray for your pores.
Smart aleck!
-  Can't we play with your game?
- No!
Nobody makes fun of my skin and gets away with it.
Besides, it's from a former receptionist.
Good picture of her.
Nice B.B.'s.
- No dibs on my game.
- Show you my ingrown toenail.
I looked at it while you were asleep.
Well, then you owe me!
Oh, buzz off!
Aha!
Got one B.B. In.
- Belly button?
- Uh-uh.
Right ear.
- Tilt!
- ##  Well, we managed to kill another five minutes of the war.
Wanna catch a rat and make it a pet?
Nah.
It's not fair to the rat to keep it in a small furnished apartment.
- You kept a cockroach.
- It was paper-trained.
Hey, the Times.
Listen to this.
"Senator Joseph McCarthy claims Communists have infiltrated the military".
I knew it.
Every time they mention those pinkos, I see red.
Relax, Comrade.
- Aaah!
Oh, ho-ho!
Bingo!
- What?
What?
What?
- We struck oil and gold!
- What is it?
- The Times crossword puzzle.
- Oh, fantastic!
Okay.
One down.
Four letters.
"Young fellow".
- Uh, "chap".
- Right.
One across.
"Member of the company".
- Four letters.
Starts with a "C".
- Uh - "Cast".
- Good.
It's kid stuff.
Ha-ha!
Got a B.B. Right in her eyeball.
Six-letter word.
"Burrowing animal".
-  "Frank Burns".
- Too many letters.
But close.
Let's see.
A burrowing animal.
A Hepler!
- A what?
- Louis Hepler.
Kid I went to high school with.
Got expelled for burrowing into the girls' washroom.
- Only guy I ever knew who got flushed out of high school.
- I don't think that's it.
- "Ferret"!
- I wonder how he thought of that.
Probably looked in the mirror.
- The third letter is a "P".
- How about "gopher"?
Bingo!
Uh, I'm sorry.
Give us another one.
Six letters, begins with "G," and means scandalmonger.
- "Gossip".
- Give that lady 14 inches of perforated intestine.
- What would I do with that?
- Make a clarinet.
-  - Margaret, uh, trim that rough edge there.
- I don't wanna leave a bad scar.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Why be so careful with a Chinese prisoner of war?
- Frank, he's a human being.
They line our wounded up against a wall and hang them!
But, Major Burns, there is the Christian ethic.
I know that!
I won a white Bible at my church for organ playing.
So lay off!
Never yell at a priest, Burns.
It's a sure ticket to hell.
More suction.
It's a waste of time, saving these slant eyes.
They're also collateral.
I'm trying to arrange a swap of their prisoners for our prisoners.
Okay, finished.
Can I help anybody?
- I'm fine.
Got this bowel by the tail.
- B.J.?
- Done and done.
- Frank?
So you can take all the credit, I suppose, huh?
I'm a perfectly competent doctor and capable of handling my own cases.
Just asking.
- We're losing him, Doctor.
- Pierce!
Help!
What are you cackling at, Major Burns?
Nothing.
Just a game to test your manual dexterity.
It's excellent for surgeons.
How childish!
- That's pornographic.
- What is?
That girl.
She's practically nude.
There's nothing wrong with the human body, Margaret.
And there's certainly nothing wrong with hers.
Oh, you have no idea how silly you look drooling over that disgusting toy.
Well, a man has to have something.
I'm very lonely, Margaret.
You deserve to be.
Look at that skimpy outfit she's wearing.
- I could buy you one like it.
- How would you like that game jammed in your ear?
Oh, don't make me nervous, Margaret.
I'll shake my B.B.'s loose.
It's too late, Frank.
All my life I've never been able to finish a Times crossword puzzle.
- One more word is all we need.
- Shoot.
Thirty-eight across.
Five letters.
Begins with a "V".
"Means a Yiddish bedbug".
Let's see.
Yiddish, Jewish, Hebrew God knows I've read my Bible.
- Did Moses speak Yiddish?
- Only when he was playing pinochle.
- Oh, Father.
- Yes, Hawk?
You know the term in Yiddish for bedbug?
In the Bible, there are hosts of locusts, plagues of vermin, and hordes of scorpions.
Boy, a lot of bedbugs in those days.
Five letters.
Starts with a "V".
Why don't you ask Corporal Shapiro?
He's sitting right over there.
- Oh, thanks, Padre.
- Mazel tov.
- Uh, Shapiro.
-  Oh, hi, y'all, Doc.
You know the Yiddish word for bedbug?
Sorry, Captain.
We been seven generations in Georgia just raisin' cotton.
And old times there are soon forgotten.
Mazel tov.
- How's that, Captain?
- Forget it.
Maybe that's it.
-  Bedbug.
- What did Shapiro say?
He can't get the cotton out of his mouth.
Thank you, dear Lord, for giving us this bounty during trying times.
Amen.
So that's what this is roast bounty.
Does that help?
With a touch of ketchup.
- Thank God for ketchup.
- He just did.
I had a friend in college used to make tomato soup out of ketchup and hot water.
That's it!
Tippy Brooks is the answer.
- What's the question?
- The puzzle.
He's a crossword freak.
He does the double crostic in ink.
- Oh, your friend the doctor on the Essex.
- Right!
- The Essex is in Pusan Harbor.
-  I know!
- Radar, let's get on the horn.
- I haven't checked my bread for maggots.
- Tell 'em you'll be right back.
- Come on.
I've got a guy in Seoul contacting the Essex.
He's a radioman first class.
-  That's nice for his mother.
- I only know him by voice.
Stevens?
Yeah, yeah!
I can hardly hear ya.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
His oatmeal cookie caught fire in the ashtray.
- Gracious living.
- Did you put it out?
Oh, he lost his cookie, but he saved his raisins.
How come we don't get raisins?
I saw some the other day, but they flew away.
That's right.
Lieutenant Brooks.
He's a doctor on the Essex.
Uh-huh?
Stevens?
Stevens, I can hardly hear y Oh, boy!
He's fading.
Hawkeye put your right hand on the wastebasket and hold your left hand out.
- Will this blow out the lightbulb in my navel?
- Uh-uh.
B.J., you hold his hand and hold your left hand straight up.
- You've got sweaty palms.
- I'm new in radio.
Stevens?
Right.
Okay, hold on.
Uh, Doctor Brooks is in surgery.
Tell him Hawkeye Pierce, MASH 4077, called.
- And needs his help desperately.
- Right.
Uh, Dr. Hawkeye Pierce, MASH 4077, needs his help real bad.
Right.
- Thanks, kid.
- What?
What?
I can't hear ya.
My aerials walked out on me.
Ah!
Whew.
Hi, Klinger.
How's it goin'?
- I'm eating a jeep.
- Good.
- Colonel?
- Radar, no interoffice running.
- Yes, sir.
- Good news.
The Chinese have agreed to a prisoner exchange.
Terrific.
Sir, we got big problems.
Hawkeye locked Burns in the nurses' latrine?
- No, sir.
That was last Friday.
- Time flies.
- Yes.
It's Klinger.
- Rats in his blue wig?
- No, sir.
He's outside having a picnic.
- Annoying but tolerable.
He's eating a jeep.
- I beg your pardon?
- He's eating a jeep.
- Which one?
- The one with the squeaky seats.
Finally came up with something fresh.
How do you see through those filthy glasses?
I know where everything is.
There he is, sir.
"A" for effort, Klinger.
But it won't work.
Watch this.
Oh, wow!
Right down.
Dip it in a little 30-weight motor oil, pop it in and let it slide down the gullet like a bluepoint oyster.
Colonel, he's crazy!
See!
I got a witness!
You gotta give me a Section Eight and send me home.
- No dice.
- If you don't throw me out for being a nut you're nuttier than I am!
- Sir.
- Sir, he just ate a piece of iron.
- That, too, shall pass.
- Okay.
The second course.
How about that?
That dumb wiper never worked anyway.
Cute idea, Klinger.
Now cancel the picnic.
You don't believe I'm gonna eat this jeep, do you, sir?
Let's say I find it hard to swallow.
Stick around, Colonel, and watch it disappear.
If you want to ruin your stomach, eat in the Mess Tent.
I need this jeep for the prisoner exchange.
Just once I'd like to sit down to a meal and not be interrupted by business.
- Gee, you think he's gonna be all right?
- Oh, he'll be fine.
We may have to slap him on the rack and give him a lube job.
- But he was eating nuts.
- Squirrels do it all the time.
Won't that hurt him, all that oil and metal?
He may slide out of bed tonight and end up pointing at the North Pole.
- You mean like a magnet?
- If he gets real bad we'll stick him to the side of a boxcar and send him down to Seoul.
Oh, you better tell the boys playing horseshoes to hold up when Klinger walks by.
Soldier, your repairs are over.
We're trading you in on a domestic model.
- Should we turn back his speedometer?
- Against the Geneva Convention.
- You - Uh-huh.
- Head.
- Little tight around the crotch?
Soo Ling say, "Thank you".
- Captain Hawkeye Pierce say, "You're welcome".
-  - Klinger, what is it?
- Something I ate.
I told you the food here should not be taken internally.
I had a couple of bolts, a horn button part of a windshield wiper and a condenser.
- Well-balanced meal.
- But crazy.
- Not crazy enough.
- I get it.
Baker!
X-ray the Lebanese for hardware.
He's in for a tune-up.
And try not to rattle when you walk.
Sir, this message just come in for you.
It's from your friend Lieutenant Brooks.
He's on his way.
- On his way?
- Yeah.
He's coming here.
- He heard about the emergency.
He's bringing an admiral.
- An admiral?
- Radar, there's no emergency.
- There isn't?
- No.
- No.
We were working on a crossword puzzle.
- We needed a word.
Don't you remember?
- Ooh, that's right.
But, hey, Lieutenant Brooks is coming here, and so's the admiral.
Boy, you guys are in a lot of trouble.
Nice.
- Sirs?
- Where can I find Dr. Pierce, Corporal?
Uh, that tent right over there, sir smells like dirty socks.
That jeep was a kidney buster.
Soldier, the head?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
- Latrine.
- Oh, it's right over there.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
Third hole pinches!
- Medicine's come a long way, Beej.
- Mmm.
There was a time when proctologists used candles.
O-O-Oh, that smarts!
- Tippy!
- Hawk.
What a hell of a trip we had.
We left the carrier this morning.
The chopper was forced down at, uh, Taejon.
Then we got a cattle train to Ansong.
Tracks were shelled.
Then we had to walk for 10 miles till a jeep picked us up.
But we made it.
Well, what's the emergency?
Tippy, this is B.J. Hunnicutt.
Uh, B.J., Tippy Brooks.
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?
- We made it.
- Terrific.
- What's the emergency, huh?
- Uh, you tell him.
He's your friend.
Tippy, I really didn't think you'd come all the way out here.
L-I just needed a five-letter Yiddish word for bedbug.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
What am I gonna tell Admiral Cox?
Oh, he'll hang me from the highest, uh Um, whatchamacallit Uh, seven letters.
Starts with "Y".
- "Yardarm".
- Th-Thanks.
Yeah.
Look, sit down.
I know you're in a big jam, but first things first.
Do you know the word?
Bedbug?
- Bedbug.
- Five letters.
- Five letters.
-  Yiddish.
Yiddish.
- Hawkeye, will you stop?
- I thought as long as you were here.
Look, we really figured you'd call back.
You guys have really got me up the creek!
The admiral thinks we're here for a medical emergency.
- What'll I tell him?
- I could hold my breath.
- We could say it's a case of blue face.
- You'd die.
Right now, a far, far better thing than me being busted to J.G. J.G.?
They'll bust you to John Garfield?
You sure surprised me when you walked in there, Admiral.
Caught me with my guard down.
The call of nature beckons to everybody.
Both army and navy.
- And the marines.
- I'm not too sure about them.
- Coffee?
- Oh, fine.
- Cox.
Cox.
Is that with an "X"?
- Yes.
That story you told me about gettin' here is a real rouser.
It's a wonder you weren't killed.
Not that I'm not glad to see ya, but I can't help wondering why you're here.
I was visiting the Essex when your emergency call came in.
I've always believed that - one branch has to come to the aid of the other.
- Uh, right.
Now, Admiral, just go in the Mess Tent here.
Order anything you want.
- I wanna check on this emergency.
- Good.
I haven't had a bite since I left the carrier.
- Specialty tonight was Egyptian sauerkraut.
- Egyptian?
- Part of their U.N. Contribution.
- Oh, I see.
We sent back the camels.
- It's all a misunderstanding.
- Getting an admiral here for a crossword puzzle?
- You guys are one for the book.
- I'm sorry.
- He's sorry.
- You were sorry when you gave Major Burns a chocolate-coated lizard.
- It was Easter.
- Now you've put your buddy's butt in a sling?
What are we gonna tell the admiral?
We gotta think of something legitimate.
He's no dummy.
He can see through a bulkhead.
Maybe we could run him through post-op, see what turns up there.
Okay.
He's bound to find problems he's never seen on a nice, clean ship.
Filth, do your stuff.
- Hey, don't worry about it.
- We're in trouble all the time.
- Say good-bye, Dr. Pierce.
- So long, Soo Ling.
- Prisoner exchange.
- Thirty of theirs for 40 of ours.
- It's a sale.
- Did you bring us here just to show us that?
- Uh, no, no, Admiral.
- Of course not.
Here's a difficult case.
Uh, Pierce?
Thank you, Colonel.
Following routine extraction of shrapnel from the leg this patient displayed unusual dehydration.
An insatiable need for liquids.
- Like a drink, soldier?
- No, thank you.
I'm not thirsty.
- I can't thank you enough, Admiral.
- It's a miracle.
- Can we get on with this?
- Yeah, let's get on with this.
- Okay, let's get on with this.
- Admiral, this is Corporal Klinger.
- What is it, soldier?
-  Huh?
- Klinger!
- Sorry.
I usually don't kiss on the first date.
- What kind of a place are you running here?
- This case is very unusual.
- This case has a screw loose.
- Close.
Baker, get us Klinger's X ray.
Admiral, if you can't send me home, can I transfer to the navy?
Look at that sonar.
He could smell a sub at 30 fathoms.
Nuts, bolts, knobs?
This guy's full of machinery.
- He was trying to eat a jeep.
- Eat a jeep?
He shouldn't even be in the service!
- I love you!
- Aah!
Only take me a minute to pack my makeup kit and rollers.
Stop it!
You've got no emergency here, Potter.
We have wasted valuable time!
Now I am gonna see there's an investigation!
Come on, Brooks.
Let's get out of this loony bin.
There's been a terrible accident!
Civilians!
They're all burned!
Crank up the O.R. Generator!
We'll need plenty of plasma.
- Oh, watch out.
Kellye!
- Careful now.
Get 'em inside.
Easy.
We have to bring them in pre-op and treat 'em in O.R.  Father Mulcahy!
Easy.
Get her into pre-op.
Move it.
-  - Father, straight into O.R. - Napalm?
- No, sir.
Gasoline.
- All right, get him into O.R. - Let's go.
- Easy.
Go easy now.
- What a mess!
- There's caps and masks in the scrub room, Tippy.
- Right.
- We've got a baby here!
-  Okay, I'll help.
- Okay.
- Easy.
Easy now.
- You got her?
- Yep.
- You a corpsman?
- The best in the business, dad.
An army fuel truck turned over in a ditch.
- The Koreans were soaking up the gasoline with rags.
- What for?
- To use in their lamps.
- Wonderful.
You know what happened?
When it got dark they couldn't see what they were doing.
- Some guy lit a match.
- And a few of his friends.
More plasma.
- You got enough morphine?
- We'll get by.
Got one who can't breathe.
Smoke inhalation.
- Bad enough for a tracheotomy?
- Yep.
- You want help?
- I got it.
I can't fix your arm until you give me the kid.
I insist you give me the kid!
-  - Well, if you can't speak English why don't you go back where you came from?
- Major Burns, let me help.
- It's-It's a waste of time, Father!
- They're heathen.
- We're all God's children.
- Oh, really?
- It's just that some of us are more childish than others.
- Margaret, 500 of Ringer's lactate.
- Yes, Doctor.
Klinger, post-op.
-  Klinger.
- Sir?
Your nose slipped out of its bra.
- Sorry, ladies.
- Give ya a hand, Colonel?
- Pierce?
- Yes, Admiral?
I've debrided the burn and applied the dressing.
Anything more I can do?
Not a thing.
Unless you want to sign up for a year.
No, thanks.
You guys work too hard.
## Seven hours in surgery.
And atop of Egyptian sauerkraut.
Is that coffee?
Powdered milk, but she won't take it.
That kid wasn't born yesterday.
-  This is Seoul City Sue.
- Time for the commercial.
I have a special message for the members of MASH 4077.
-  - We're on the radio.
One of the prisoners you returned has had head surgery for the purpose of inhuman experiments.
We brand Dr. Hawkeye Pierce a war criminal.
- A war criminal?
- All I did was stitch up that guy's scalp.
Was I supposed to let him bleed to death?
- Turn the other cheek, Hawkeye.
- Both cheeks are already sore.
That dame lies as much as my sister-in-law, Bertha.
You know, that really roasts my butt.
Why don't we put out some propaganda of our own?
-  Like what, Admiral?
- Like those burn victims.
Why don't we say they were firebombed by the enemy because they cooperated with us?
- Why should we say that?
- Because it's a very effective weapon, Pierce.
Every time they put out something, we should put out something worse.
They lie and then we lie.
Where does it end?
Oh, maybe you're right.
But it still steams me.
It steams me too, but it's gotta stop somewhere.
She simply won't take powdered milk.
She needs fresh.
I wish we had a goat.
Let me try, Father.
Hi.
Can I see you for a little bit?
Let me see you for a little bit, huh?
Get a little of this stuff.
You want the cup?
She's taking the milk.
Now that's propaganda.
I can't tell you how grateful I am for the way you two pitched in.
- Uh, glad we could help.
- Can he drive all right?
Sure.
That's his driving hat.
One more thing.
Pierce, you obviously didn't need us when you called.
Why did you get us up here?
Well, I'm sorry, Admiral.
It was a misunderstanding.
We needed help with a crossword puzzle.
A crossword puzzle?
We were stuck.
A five-letter Yiddish word for bedbug.
I don't believe it.
You dragged us all the way up here just to get the word "vontz"?
Vontz!
- Vontz!
- Beej, it's vontz!
Good luck, Admiral.
Now look, we've got plenty of time.
There's no need to speed.
Aye, aye, sir.
And, Klinger, no kissing!
I got 14 B.B.'s in the holes.
Now only one more to go.
- Want some help with that?
- I can manage by myself, thank you.
- You're welcome.
- You're spending a lot of time and energy on that fool thing.
Well, I've almost Ahh Aha!
I got it!
Last one right in her nose.
All 15!
- Look!
Look!
- Very nice, Frank.
-  - Ohh!
- What happened?
- Well, I had it, and you jiggled it.
- I did?
- You did it on purpose.
Every time I do something special, you spoil it.
So do it again.
Do it again, he says.
Hmph!
Three days.
Three days.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
All right.
Let's go, Cho!
- Look at the spin Cho puts on that ball.
- Kill him, Cho.
Kill him.
Colonel Potter, please.
A little dignity.
Dignity, hell.
I got three bucks on this.
-  Wow!
-   Final set.
Match point.
Cho leads 20-17.
-  Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
-  Come on.
-  Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
- Let's go, Cho!
I haven't seen a backhand like that since I tried an exploratory on Nurse Baker.
-  -  Match point.
20-18.
Beauty, Cho.
Yeah!
We won!
Frank, we won!
- Aw, fudge!
- Frank, you bet against us.
Well, I got three-to-one odds.
Take it easy.
You'll all get your money.
We're in the champ's dressing room.
Congratulations, Cho.
You came through for us.
I did it for the 4077 th, Colonel Potter, and apple pie.
- Say a few words to the folks at home.
- Hello, folks at home.
- I did it for you too.
- Thanks.
Why don't you take a shower?
- I'd rather have cash.
- Speaking of cash, I must see my bookie.
Okay, Igor, let me have my money.
I must have paid out too much.
- Wait a minute.
I'm a winner.
- You're lucky.
A lot of guys lost.
Attention all personnel.
Incoming wounded.
All available surgeons to operating room.
-  Ping-Pong poopers!
- They heard we were having fun, so they attacked.
This war is just one big joke to you, isn't it, Dr. Wisenheimer?
Right, Frank.
I'm laughing all the way to the blood bank.
Why don't you look where you're going?
I wasn't moving, Major.
You ran into me.
Then why don't you look where I'm going?
These Occident-prone accidentals.
They can't do anything right.
He didn't look too clumsy when he was winning the championship.
If you ask me, the other guy threw the match.
- They stick together, you know.
- Like North and South Korea.
- You bet against us, huh, Frank?
- At Pearl Harbor, he took the Japanese and six points.
- Well, he got three-to-one.
- It's guys like you that ruin a man's reputation.
We're only doing what you'd do, Frank, if you had time.
Business has really been brisk today.
Word of mouth.
You do good work, one wounded man tells another.
Giving away free ammunition hasn't hurt business either.
Casualties were greater than Headquarters anticipated.
Beats me how the experts can tell how many wounded we're gonna get.
If they're so smart, why don't they find a way to put a stop to this nonsense?
I can hear every word you're sayin', Doc.
That's because the fragment is in your rear instead of your ear.
- The anesthetic isn't working.
-  Relax, soldier.
We haven't given it to you yet.
I'm Lieutenant Colonel Harold Becket, damn it.
Don't blame me.
I didn't name ya.
It's kind of hard to tell an officer from an enlisted man at this angle.
Did you see all those wounded?
They're my boys.
- I bet your wife wanted a girl.
-  Becket?
Is that you?
- I know that voice.
-  Harold Becket.
Sherman Po you old army mule.
- Takes one to know one.
- What are you doing here?
He's with a group of underprivileged soldiers that got sent to camp for the summer.
I never expected to see your ugly face again.
Just like the old days, Harold.
You put your best foot forward and they shoot you where you think.
- What does it look like, Doctor?
- Looks like any other butt.
- Nothing serious.
- Don't worry.
We'll have this in a sling in no time.
Have 'em take good care of me, Sherm.
These boys know what they're doin'.
We specialize in officers' butts.
- They're trained in brain surgery.
- Oh, God help me.
That's what I'm here for.
Okay, fill 'er up, angel.
- What'll we drink to?
- It's now 4:00.
Why don't we drink to 5:00?
- We drank to 5:00 yesterday.
Let's drink to 6:00.
- Ah.
You know, this is a particularly good brew.
What's the secret?
I used a pair of 1949 sweat socks with matching garters.
- No wonder.
This vintage has legs.
-  - Cho!
- Hey!
Come in, champ.
Captains, I am pleased to introduce to you my friend Soony.
- How do you do, Soony?
- Hello, Soony.
Come on in.
Have a seat.
Excuse the mess.
Our houseboy was drafted two years ago.
Ohh.
Nice.
Nice Swamp.
We were going to redecorate, but why put money into a place when you're just renting?
You got mess?
Soony will clean for you.
-  - Ohh!
- Yes.
Yes.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
Soony's a good housekeeper.
She'll make this place like a new Swamp.
No, please.
Don't disturb the dust.
It's right where we like it.
- I don't know how this got in here.
Please.
- Okay.
- Don't clean.
It makes me nervous.
- Okay.
Soony's looking for a job.
- Maybe we can help her find something.
- Sure.
Soony can clean anything.
You know, spick-and-span.
- How much English do you speak, Soony?
- Some of it.
- That much.
-  And I have an announcement to make.
We're getting married.
Hey!
Mixed doubles!
Congratulations, champ.
Congratulations, Soony.
- You're welcome.
- And you're both invited to the wedding.
- Thank you.
- Terrific.
Where's it gonna be?
I don't know yet.
Soony's village is flat as a pancake from artillery.
She's an orphan.
Maybe you could get married here.
Would you like that?
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
You made Soony and me very happy.
- When do you want the wedding?
- As soon as I get enough money for the ring.
-  How much do you need for that?
- I have 60 American dollars.
- I need 40 more.
- What do you say, Beej?
Twenty dollars will get you a seat on the bride's side.
No Soony said than done.
I always like looking on the bride side.
My Uncle Lew in Seoul sells jewelry wholesale also a little retail.
He has a gold ring with a big diamond for a hundred dollars.
Careful your Uncle Lew doesn't do to you what our Uncle Sam is doing to us.
Oh, no.
Uncle Lew is one honest john.
Here.
You can pay us back whenever you get it.
I'll pay you back.
I'll pay you back right away.
Good-bye, Captain Hawkeye, Captain B.J. - Good-bye.
Good-bye.
- Bye-bye, Soony.
- You're welcome!
-  Thank you.
- Step on a feather, Frank?
- You're a great judge of character, Pierce.
- I always knew you didn't have any.
- Lending money to an Oriental.
- You can say sayonara to your moola.
- He'll pay us back.
I wouldn't lend him a dime unless he was able to put up some collateral.
Frank, whatever collateral he had we blew up last week.
Smarty-pants.
You won't see him again.
A fool and his money are soon parted.
Somebody's been using my broom.
Oh, yeah.
There was that little girl who was in here with the long blond curls.
- Ate your porridge.
- Sat on your chair.
Said your bed was just right.
Well, tell her to knock it off.
- Major Burns, sir?
- Don't ever sneak up on me like that, twerp!
- Especially when you're with one of them.
- She's one of us.
- She may be one of you, but she's not one of me.
- Miss Soony wants a job.
- She's very good at sweeping floors and washing dishes.
- There's a war going on.
We can't hire anyone without running a security check.
- But she's on our side.
- Everyone has to be cleared.
Even General MacArthur's pipe stuffer has to be checked out.
- She doesn't want to stuff his pipe.
- Corporal, be quiet.
Let me interrogate the job applicant.
Sit down, please.
Sit, please.
Are you now, or have you ever been a member of a Communist dishwashing organization?
Uh, sir, I don't think she understands that question.
Well, what about you?
My mother used to wash the dishes, but sometimes I dried.
Oh, cockypop!
How long have you lived in Korea?
Born Korea.
- I think that means all her life.
- Have you made any recent trips to Russia Red China, or Albania?
She doesn't have enough money to get to Seoul.
That's why she wants a job.
Put a cork in it, half-pint!
Unless there's a call for Philip Morris.
Would you be willing to defend this land in the event of an enemy attack?
Sir, the enemy already attacked.
Stop being a buttinsky!
Why is she smiling?
- I think she likes you, sir.
- She does?
Now none of those inscrutable tricks.
Have you any references from previous employers?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
Papers.
Yes, sir.
She has these papers and references from people she worked for.
- Uh-huh.
Took care of General Horton's children?
- That's right, sir.
Have you any papers to prove that these are your papers?
- Why would she need papers to prove - Stay out of this, runt!
I'm gonna have to do some checking.
In the meantime, no funny stuff.
Don't try to leave the country, and, uh get out of my chair.
Hiya, Harold.
Don't get up.
Hi, Sherm.
I thought you'd forgotten your old buddy.
I was giving my horse a mambo lesson.
Still got a great sense of humor, you rascal.
Keeps me from playing with my toes.
How's your back pocket feel?
Oh, it's cooling off.
Say, uh, if any of the boys want something special, just put it on my check.
Well, if they order an extra pint of blood during the happy hour, it's on the house.
Sherm, how many years has it been?
Oh, must be 30 at least.
Remember Camp Grant?
Those two gals we picked up in Chicago?
What a wild weekend that was.
As I recall, mine was the cutie.
Yours looked like Man o' War.
Hey, wait a minute.
I think I married that girl.
Oh, that's right.
Mine looked like Man o' War.
Oh, don't feel bad, Sherm.
It didn't last.
She was okay for six furlongs, but she couldn't go the distance.
The last I heard, you were quartered back in Washington.
Yeah, buying commodities for the troops.
- Vegetables, fruit, meat.
- Oh, so you're the guy.
Oh, I ordered the best.
Choicest cuts of beef.
Somebody didn't get your order.
I had a hamburger last night that whinnied.
It's not my fault.
Everything's overcooked.
Even the milk.
Oh, don't make me laugh, please.
My butt'll fall off.
What's an old desk jockey like you doing out here?
Well I need 30 days on the line for my Combat Infantry Badge.
Why risk your life for that?
With that in my record, the boys in Washington can move me up.
I can retire a full colonel.
How long do you figure I'll be here, Sherm?
I need five more days up there.
If the food doesn't kill ya, you and your busted butt will be out of here in less than a week.
There you go.
- Why don't we go over to your place and, uh - Some other time.
- Why don't we go over to my place and pretend we're at your place?
- Some other time.
We can some other time some other time.
Why don't we some other time it right now?
Too tired.
I'm gonna rinse out some things I may not even take off.
You wash, I'll dry.
- Some other time.
- Some other time.
Soony?
- What's the matter, Soony?
- Cho not come back.
Oh, he probably just stayed to buy a wedding present.
Cho will be back.
No.
No.
Two days.
Not come back.
Well, it looks like your Marshall Plan backfired.
Your little friend ran off with your 40 smackers and left you with egg foo yung on your face.
Don't listen to him.
Cho will be back.
No.
No.
Never come back.
I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so.
Frank, you will never be known as the Ugly American.
You're overqualified.
-  Hawkeye?
- He's first.
Prep him.
- Hey, it's the champ in a Korean uniform.
- How bad is he?
He won't be playing Ping-Pong for a while.
What happened, Cho?
Big mix-up in Seoul.
Soony all right?
- She'll be fine now.
- Radar, find Soony and tell her that Cho is back.
- Tell her to save some rice for her wedding.
- Oh, boy!
- Can you get the other end?
- Yeah.
I was walking down the street in Seoul.
Two Korean M.P. S grabbed me and threw me in a truck said, "You drafted".
- Shanghaied in Seoul.
- Makes you wonder who the enemy is.
- One hour of basic training and they sent me to the front.
- One hour and he's G.I. Cho.
- Very punny.
- I bought a nice ring for Soony.
Where's the ring?
It's okay.
I put all your possessions in this ditty bag.
- Hey.
- Hey, that's a beauty, Cho.
She'll love that.
Major Houlihan, you want to see Soony's engagement ring?
Ohh.
That's very nice.
Really.
Of course I would never wear anything that big.
Not with a boyfriend as chintzy as yours.
Donald isn't cheap.
He's conservative.
He's conserving every penny he's got.
This ring is priceless.
Why don't you put it in a safe-deposit thimble?
- Soony will love that ring, Cho.
- Thank you.
Ah.
I see the con man's back.
- What's he doing in a Korean uniform?
- Getting shot at, Frank.
- You ought to try it sometime.
- I think we ought to run a check.
Check, check, check!
You'd run a check on your own mother.
Well, if she was an Oriental Ping-Pong player, you bet I would.
Why don't you check yourself into a closet?
Why hasn't he been moved out to the 121 st evac?
Because he's in guarded condition, Frank.
- That's doctor talk.
- Yeah, and you Eastern liberals are his guards.
He should be moved out.
We could use his bed for one of our own.
Frank, everyone who's sick has a bed, except you.
Look who's talking, tubercular head.
Now that's doctor talk.
- Pierce, you know what this is?
- Another paternity suit?
- Close.
- A paternity hat?
It's a declaration of war.
A list of grievances against you signed by Major Burns.
I plead guilty, and I'd like to throw myself on the mercy of Nurse Able.
We all know when the good Lord passed out paranoia, Frank Burns got in line twice.
Three times.
Thank you.
The third time to deny he'd ever been in line.
Burns is threatening to call General Harrelson.
Now why hasn't Cho been sent back down to the 121 st hospital like the rest of the post-ops?
- Uh - Colonel, we took a piece of shrapnel out of his shoulder and, uh, complications have set in.
- What complications?
- He wants to get married.
Doctors, in 16 months, three weeks and four days I expect to be standing on my patio back in Nebraska, barbecuing.
Why are you wetting on my charcoal?
Aw, come on, Colonel.
You know how sentimental you are about weddings.
Yes, when they're in my own family.
Exactly.
At the wedding tomorrow, you're giving away the bride.
I am?
Well, why didn't you tell me?
- I just thought of it.
- Radar.
- Have the colonel's dress uniform pressed right away.
- Have my dress uniform Okay.
So I'm the father of the bride.
Ah, I wish Mother was here.
She loves to cry.
This is Sergeant Blanchard.
Tell Captain Pierce what you told me.
- Are you sure he's okay?
- He's not okay, but you can trust him.
All right.
All right.
They can court-martial me if they want but if it wasn't for that stupid Colonel Becket, I wouldn't be here now.
And most of the rest of these guys wouldn't be here either.
- What are you talking about?
- Becket's incompetent.
He nearly got us all killed.
How could they send an office boy up to lead combat troops?
- What did he do?
- He choked.
When the enemy hit us with the big stuff, the colonel panicked.
He He didn't react when the orders came up to withdraw.
Can you believe that?
- Why would they give him a command?
- As a birthday present.
Th-That's close.
His pals gave it to him.
He needs five more days to, uh, get his Infantry Badge.
Then they promote him, and he retires a full colonel.
And a lot of kids retire permanently.
Becket stood there, screaming orders out of an army manual.
The men were laughing at him.
Well, none of'em are laughing now.
- Is Potter asleep now?
- Yeah.
We'll hit him with this tomorrow.
Either way, it's gonna be a rude awakening.
- Another ringer.
- I don't understand how you do it, Klinger.
- I learned to throw horseshoes in Toledo.
- What's that got to do with it?
We didn't throw 'em for fun.
We threw 'em in self-defense.
Another game, sir?
Nope.
Don't want to be beaten five times in a row by somebody in a skirt.
- Colonel, we'd like a word.
- Take any word you want.
It's yours.
- How about "stupidity"?
- I like "criminal stupidity" better.
- What are you two talking about?
- We're talking about Colonel Harold Becket.
Hang on to that horseshoe.
You might want to wrap it around his neck.
The way I've been playing, I'd probably miss.
I gather you don't like him.
- You gather correctly.
- He's an old friend of mine.
He'd have to be an old friend.
He can't make any new ones.
Ma'am, I gotta feed my guinea pig.
Are you finished?
No, and for heaven's sake, stand still.
Why do I have to do this?
Why don't you get Klinger?
He's good at it.
Because you're the bride's size.
Don't move!
Oh, I think I hate this.
Back home this kind of thing doesn't go over too big.
You never looked better.
We had this guy back home who used to wear dresses just like Klinger - only he wasn't in the army, if you know what I mean.
- To each his own.
One day this guy Boris is walking down the street with a cotton dress carrying an umbrella, and my Uncle Ed walks up to him and calls him a sissy.
- Then pow!
He punches him right in the nose and flattens him.
- Your Uncle Ed punched Boris?
No, Boris flattened my Uncle Ed.
Hi, honey.
I'm home.
- Come on, guys.
- He hates it when you call him "honey" in front of strangers.
Listen, sweetheart.
What are you doing after the wedding?
Will you guys cut it out!
Ma'am, are you finished, please?
My palms are sweating, and it's spreading all over my body.
Just a minute, Corporal.
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey, Klinger, this isn't my idea.
I don't care whose idea it is.
You're working my side of the street.
- It'll just take a minute.
- How would you like it if I slept with a teddy bear?
Klinger, beat it.
Nobody wears that high-waisted bodice anymore.
Major, can I see you for a minute?
Excuse me, madam.
- I'm not a madam.
I'm a corporal.
- What are you doing in that dress?
- Sweating, sir.
- Frank, can you come back later?
Can't you see I'm busy?
Margaret, I have to talk to you.
What I have to say is important.
Oh, all right.
Radar, you move, I'll stick a pin in your leg.
All right, Frank.
What's so important?
Margaret, yesterday we had a smooth-running war here.
Today nothing makes sense.
What's going on?
A wedding's going on, Frank.
That's what's going on.
I don't think the American taxpayer should pay for the wedding between two pagans.
They're not pagans, Frank.
Everybody's wearing clothes.
I basically oppose these impulsive wartime marriages.
Especially if it cuts into your impulsive wartime maneuvers.
Oh!
I know what you think I'm saying, but I'm not saying that.
I know what you're saying, and you know what I'm saying about what you're saying.
- You didn't have to say that.
-  Couldn't we go over to your tent and talk this over?
- My tent is off-limits to you, Frank.
- Margaret.
Frank, you can move your hand or lose it.
- Morning, Harold.
How are you doin'?
- Oh, fine, Sherm.
Couple of days, I'll be back on my seat again.
Tell me about your duty on the line.
What happened up there?
Well, it was rough.
We got clomped pretty good.
I think Army Intelligence let us down.
Army Intelligence, huh?
I hear you screwed up.
You blew it.
- What are you talking about?
- You were ordered to withdraw, and you froze.
Listen, Sherm.
The pressure was incredible.
I'll admit I could have done better.
But I did pretty good for a guy who hasn't seen any action in 25 years.
You don't belong up there.
You belong back in Washington buying meat and potatoes.
Okay, combat's not my specialty.
I'm just up there because I need my Combat Infantry Badge.
- You're not gonna get it.
- What are you talking about?
You're not going back.
I'm sending you down.
I just need five more days, Sherm.
Five more days for a promotion.
Don't mess that up.
I don't give a damn about your promotion or your lousy C.I.B. All I care about is those kids.
Please, Sherm.
We're old friends.
I don't care if it costs me every friend I've got.
If one kid gets hurt, the price is too high.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm due at a wedding.
I'm giving the bride away.
##  They won't get away with it.
General Harrelson will hear about this.
Oh, shut up.
As I understand the Buddhist wedding ceremony the groom usually arrives on a small white pony.
##  It's a silent ceremony.
No words are spoken.
After the groom approaches the bride a helper pours rice wine for both of them.
## They drink.
They bow to one another.
The groom places the ring on the bride's finger.
## - And they are married.
-  I'm sorry, sir.
I'm really sorry.
Don't apologize for winning.
What's the score?
It doesn't matter whether you win or lose the game.
It's how you get court-martialed!
- You mean that, sir?
- Of course not, Radar.
Play.
Make it two out of three.
How many points you gonna spot me?
- Same as last game.
Eighteen.
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, shut up!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Hey, kid, get down!
Get down!
Billy, I'm hit!
I'm coming for you.
Just keep your head down.
I'm coming.
Billy?
Billy?
- Billy?
Billy!
-  -  - Medic!
Medic!
- Hey, how bad is it?
- You'll make it.
Come on.
I want to know how bad it is.
Okay, let's get him on the litter!
Take it easy.
You'll be all right.
- How about the kid?
- He'll be fine.
- W-Was he hurt bad?
- Iodine and Band-Aids.
- Thank God.
- You're welcome.
Hey, watch it.
Go on, kill 'em!
Th-That's it!
Boy.
Fight 'em in there.
Go get 'em.
Hey, Klinger.
Get the big guy.
He's from the 8063rd.
- And ruin my hat?
- This is fightin', Klinger.
You're an American.
But this is Korea Ooh!
You don't like it here, why don't you go back where you came from?
Why do you think I'm wearing this dress?
Listen, this is a battalion aid station, not Walter Reed.
I got a sergeant here who looks pretty bad.
He can't take an ambulance trip.
- Send the chopper now!
-  - He'll need another shot of morphine for the ride.
-  Let up on that tourniquet every 20 seconds.
Must have cut your leg on something, huh, Tyler?
Look, Doc, there's nothing missing on me, is there?
- I'm still in one piece, right?
- You're fine.
- There ain't nothin' gone?
- Relax.
You're still in one piece.
Welcome to MASH.
The boy will take your luggage.
If you tip him, you may even get it back.
- Look at that leg.
Yuck!
- Don't mind him.
He's a leg man.
Give him a unit of whole blood and prep him.
Frank, you ever heard of patient morale?
- I'm a doctor, not an entertainer.
- You had me fooled.
- Didn't you think he was a comic?
- He's got everybody in stitches - whether they need them or not.
- Aw, chowderheads.
That man's a foreigner.
I'm not operating on him.
Believe it or not, this is your lucky day.
Hey, Hawkeye, you know who that is over there?
- Eleanor Roosevelt?
- No, that's Billy Tyler.
- You mean the Billy Tyler?
- Yeah.
Incredible.
Who's Billy Tyler?
You know, the All-American running back from Iowa.
Tied the Big Ten rushing record for a single season.
Surefire star for the pros.
Did you swallow a radio announcer?
Everyone in Iowa knows Billy Tyler.
- Geez, is he hurt bad?
- He ain't hurt good.
Hey, Captain Pierce, I got another casualty here.
- That's Kornhaus.
- What team does he play for?
He's the cook's assistant.
- What happened?
- There was a fight in Rosie's Bar.
- This war's getting dangerous.
- What's going on here?
Frank, this is P.F.C. Kornhaus, the cook's assistant.
- He slipped and cracked his head open on some Jell-O.
- Jell-O?
- Dr. Pierce, it's time to wash your hands.
- Oh, is supper ready?
Must be.
There's a table waiting for you in O.R. Jokes, jokes, jokes.
And you call yourselves doctors?
- Only when we're sick.
- Take care of him, Frank.
Next time you get near Jell-O, wear your helmet.
Doc.
Before you put me under tell me what are you gonna do?
- Our very best.
- Is that gonna be good enough?
We come highly recommended.
- And besides, we're the only game in town.
- I want it straight.
How bad am I?
You'll make it, Sergeant.
- Will the leg?
- We'll do everything we can.
Doc, please.
If you can't save the leg, don't save me.
Hey, Klinger.
You know where our cook is?
He's in pre-op.
- Better there than in the kitchen.
- It's because of you.
- I wasn't in the fight.
- I noticed.
Afraid to get your dress wrinkled?
- You can't wrinkle this.
It's nylon.
- I oughta punch you in the nose.
- Your fist isn't big enough.
- I can't stand any guy that won't fight for his outfit.
I was fighting for my outfit.
I didn't want to tear it.
You're a weak-kneed, chickenhearted jellyfish!
- You're a fat-necked, lily-livered blowhard!
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!
- Will you listen?
- What is it?
- I'm getting squished.
-  Can you work any faster?
-  I'm already playing the "Minute Waltz" in 30 seconds.
Lousy peripheral pulse.
Can you find another graft, Hawk?
That vein you're hooking up to seems awfully narrow.
- This is the best one he's got left.
- You have enough five-oh silk?
I got plenty of everything but patient.
I wish I had your sense of humor, Doctor.
I wish I did too.
Gentlemen and lady, we have a true hero with us today.
Sit down, Kornhaus.
A man with true esprit de corps.
A man who knows what troop morale really means.
- Burns, do me a favor.
- Anything, sir.
Stick a handful of retractors in your mouth.
But, Colonel, Kornhaus went to bat for the honor of the 4077 th.
He may be a little bloody, but you ought to see the other guy.
Right, Kornhaus?
- Naw, he looks pretty good.
- Yeah, I'll bet.
You're okay, Kornhaus.
Well, you're in good hands.
Just a little Mercurochrome.
This isn't gonna sting, is it, Doc?
Soldier, it's gonna hurt me more than you.
Frank's so clumsy, he's probably right.
Colonel, will you tell Pierce not to call me clumsy in front of Major Houlihan?
It's too late, Burns.
She already knows.
-  Boy, this is tough.
-  One of the toughest.
This place is a mess.
Get it?
A mess?
I made a joke.
- So did your father.
- No, I mean it's really a mess.
Why don't you and the nurses decorate it up a little?
- In war, Frank, decorations belong on a soldier's chest.
- That's true.
Like my fiance, Colonel Penobscott a soldier's soldier, a fighter.
Oh, yeah?
You want to see a fighter?
I'll show you a fighter.
- Zale.
- Yes, sir?
- Tell the major about Rosie's Bar.
- Huh?
You know, how you defended the honor of the 4077 th with your fists.
Ah, I didn't need no fists.
I use these.
I'm great at eye gouging.
An eye gouger.
An animal.
- And he takes orders from me.
-  What are you doin' here, Zale?
This is where people eat.
- Beat it.
I'll give you 10 seconds.
- You can't count that high.
You sold out your own buddies, Benedict Arnold.
- Excuse me.
Mrs. Benedict Arnold.
- I accept your apology.
- Come on.
Move it.
- Watch it.
I wouldn't want to get you mad or nothin'.
Good.
'Cause when I get pushed, I get sore.
- You like mashed potatoes?
- Yeah.
Good.
Have mine!
Thanks.
Here.
Here's some lemon pie!
- Make them stop, Frank!
-  - Or are you afraid?
- Oh, come on, guys.
Stop it!
-  Please?
-  - They won't stop.
- Ohh!
All right, knock it off!
.
Knock it off!
There's no excuse for this sort of animal behavior, not even from enlisted.
Major, I'll handle this.
All right, who started it?
- He did.
- He did.
Well, we'll never get to the bottom of this.
Shake hands and forget it.
Wait a second!
Clean that up.
- Are you gonna let them off that easy?
- What else can I do?
Donald certainly wouldn't have handled it that way.
I'm not interested in how Donald would have handled it.
- How would he have handled it?
- He'd make them fight it out.
- That's exactly what I was going to do.
- Really?
Of course.
All right, now listen, you two bozos.
Tomorrow, 1600 hours, near the latrine.
You're gonna put on the mitts, and we're gonna see who the best man really is.
Comprende?
Good.
Now, the first man knocked unconscious will be the loser.
Dismissed.
- Frank, that took real guts.
- It did?
Well, of course it did.
- Sometimes an officer has to break regulations.
- What?
- Just make sure Colonel Potter doesn't hear about it.
- Who's afraid of Colonel Potter?
Besides, a man's got to be a man, or he's not a man.
The rule book may frown on it, Margaret, but war is war.
Did you take my raisin bun?
How you feeling, Billy?
That's a stupid question.
You feel lousy.
No, I feel okay.
I mean, the leg hurts, but it's there.
So I feel pretty good.
Listen, Billy You know, I played a whole quarter against Michigan with a sprained ankle.
Hurt worse than this.
Listen, Billy.
We tried, but the artery was just too busted up.
The operation didn't work.
We couldn't save it.
What do you mean?
I feel that leg, Doc.
It's there.
No, that pain you think is in your leg is in your head.
It's called a phantom pain.
It's just a leftover.
But it's there.
I'm not gonna listen to some phantom pain bull.
Oh, my God.
What did you guys do to me?
We had to, Billy.
You had no right.
You had no right to do it.
Easy, Sergeant.
Take it easy.
What's another leg or arm to you?
Billy, there was just too much damage.
- We did everything we could.
- You didn't do enough.
- Listen, I know what you're going through.
- No, you don't.
There's no way you could possibly know.
You're angry.
I'd feel the same way if I were you.
You're not me.
Don't tell me how I should feel.
- Sergeant, you need your rest.
- Why don't you try to get some sleep?
Why don't you go to hell?
- Is it animal, vegetable or mineral?
- Yes.
- Come on.
Which one?
- Animal.
- A cold-blooded animal?
- Yes.
- Then it's either a snake or Frank Burns.
- Same thing.
You know, I never get used to it.
I always feel there's something more I should have done.
You did everything that was humanly possible.
I know how it's supposed to go for them.
Shock, anger, readjustment.
But all we ever see is the shock and the anger.
Hawk, look what you're doing.
You're punishing yourself with guilt.
I think I'm having an identity crisis.
I know I'm Dr. Pierce, but I want to be God.
If you ever get the job, don't forget your old friends.
-  - Excuse me, sirs.
Am I disturbing you, sirs?
No.
Come on in, Radar.
- You guys mind if I have a drink?
- No, go ahead.
- I thought your liver was still a virgin.
- Don't be silly.
I'm a man.
And you thought we enjoyed this stuff.
I thought this stuff was supposed to make you feel better.
No.
It's supposed to make you feel nothing.
- Maybe I ought to take some over for Billy.
- That's not what he needs.
I know.
But, boy, he was such a great football player.
What's he supposed to do now?
Radar, there's more to life than playing football.
I know, but gee.
I'd like to go over and talk to him in the morning, keep him company.
- Why don't you?
- L-I just don't know what to say.
If you find the right words, let me know.
I sure could use them.
Yes, sir.
- What are you doing here, pip-squeak?
- I'm leaving, sir.
- Don't make excuses.
Get out.
-  Frank, why don't you swallow your face?
- He did.
That's why he looks that way.
- What was he doing in here?
- Something you wouldn't understand, Frank.
- He was talking intelligently.
- He was talking about me, wasn't he?
- Oh, gee, let me think.
Did Radar use the word "jerk"?
That rotten fink!
He snitched.
He spilled the beans, didn't he?
Yeah, he told us all about you.
And I set up that fight to be top secret.
Well, you did a good job till a couple of seconds ago.
If you rat on me, Klinger and Zale are gonna get in trouble too.
Why would we rat on you?
A fight sounds like fun.
I like to see guys beat the hell out of each other.
It makes you forget the war.
See, there are some things we can agree on.
near the latrine.
The latrine.
A perfect spot.
- Picked the site myself.
-  Figures, Frank.
The body goes where the mind is.
- Klinger, are you keeping fit or having one?
- Oh, uh - I missed calisthenics this morning, sir.
- We don't have calisthenics.
No wonder I missed them.
Knock it off, Klinger.
I know all about the fight.
Where's Zale?
He's working out, two tents over.
Come with me, Princess.
- Does this mean we're going steady?
- You're not exactly my type.
Tell the truth.
It's my big nose, isn't it?
Your nose isn't too big.
Your face is too small.
- Looks aren't everything, you know.
- Easy for you to say.
- Zale?
Zale!
- Sir?
- What were you doing?
- I was trying to tighten up the face muscles.
Tight face, loose brains.
- How would you like some loose teeth?
- Hold it!
Hold it!
- You two are a couple of real suckers.
- What are you talking about?
- Whose idea was this fight?
- Wasn't mine.
- Wasn't mine.
- Then it had to be somebody with less brains than the two of you.
Yes, sir.
It was Major Burns.
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's getting you two to punch each other silly, so he can feel more like a man.
- You really think so?
- Is Eisenhower bald?
Shake hands and bury the hatchet.
- Okay.
Put your hand out and I'll shake it.
- Put yours out first.
- After you.
- Baloney!
You put your hand out.
- I don't believe it.
Two guys looking for a handout.
- You afraid I'm gonna break it?
- You couldn't break an egg with a hammer.
- I'll crack you.
Well, if you need any more help, please hesitate to call.
Come on.
See you later, buzzard beak.
If my dog had your face, I'd shave his butt and teach him to walk backwards.
Go take a shower, Klinger.
Cool off.
- Hawkeye!
Hawk, you gotta come talk to Billy.
- What's the matter?
- He wants out.
- What are you talking about?
He's getting out.
No, he wants out out.
He wants to be dead.
He asked for some pills or something.
-  - Damn.
- How you doing?
- Not so good.
Word has it you want to retire permanently.
You got it, Doc.
They don't make football uniforms with one leg.
Yeah, you're right.
Once you lose a leg, nothing works anymore.
Your eyes, your mouth, your hands, your brain.
You might as well chuck it all.
Don't try to con me.
Playing ball was all I had.
It's the only thing I know.
- And without that, you're nothing.
- Listen, I'm not stupid.
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to get me to stand on my own two feet.
Well, I can't do that anymore.
-  Maybe you are stupid.
- What?
If you think all you can do is play football, you have a pretty narrow view of life.
What were you gonna do when you turned 40?
I was gonna look back on a great career.
Well, now you're gonna have to look forward to something else.
Like what?
The only thing I knew how to do was run.
You're still running, Billy.
Only now you're running away.
Sergeant, have you got a minute?
What is it, Corporal?
Uh, I got something I want to show you.
It's Life magazine.
There's an article in here on last year's Iowa-Minnesota game.
Oh, I just got it.
The mail's a little slow, you know.
Look.
There's a picture right here of you getting tackled.
Yeah.
That was in the first quarter.
Were they wiping us up.
Yeah, I know.
I listened to that game on Armed Forces Radio.
Boy, what a finish.
I was sitting there screaming "Go, Iowa!
Go, Tyler!
Get 'em!
Get 'em"!
That was one hell of a game.
Minnesota had us stopped dead.
What defense.
We couldn't move up the middle, and we couldn't go wide and whenever we went to the bomb, they intercepted.
I know.
Iowa could hardly move the ball at all.
They had us stopped cold down to the last two minutes of the game.
So, we went to the short pass.
Dumping quick ones just over the line.
And we slowly moved the ball down the field.
And then you dove over in the last 20 seconds.
It was those short passes that did it.
There's always a way to beat 'em.
You just have to keep trying till you find it.
-  Where's the ring announcer?
-  Here, sir.
Will you hurry up?
- You nincompoop!
- I'm sorry, sir.
I was never very good at ropes.
- Make the announcement.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, bell.
-  In this corner, wearing olive drab trunks from Brooklyn "Smile when you say that" Sergeant "Killer" Zale.
- Hey!
Yeah!
-  Isn't this exciting, Major?
People fighting, punching each other out?
Of course it isn't.
I think it's barbaric.
- And you wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Right.
-  - And in this corner wearing pink pedal pushers, a polka-dot blouse and a swell cherry hat from Toledo, Ohio Corporal Max "I'll do anything to get out" Klinger!
Animals.
Okay, you guys know the rules.
I want a nice, clean fight.
And if you can't do that, anything goes.
You got that?
All right.
Back to your corners and come out at the sound of the bell.
Be careful.
I'd hate to see a nice outfit like that get ruined.
- Don't worry, Captain.
We got it all worked out.
-  - I think that's for me.
- It's not for me.
Aw, why don't they hit each other?
They're just dancing around.
I think they went to the Arthur Murray school of boxing.
Come on, you guys.
Mix it up!
Throw some punches.
That's an order.
Come on.
Mix it up!
Come on.
Fight, you bums!
-  -  - Frank sure knows how to put on a fight.
- It was a knockout.
It just proves the old adage: "He who lives by the mouth gets punched in it".
- How old is that adage?
- At least three or four seconds.
There we go.
Well, so long, Billy.
- I'm gonna miss talking to you.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna miss you too, Walter.
- Billy and me call each other by our first names.
- Did you make any decisions yet?
I decided to go to the short pass.
- Hey.
- How's that?
I'll explain it to you later.
Oh, by the way, Doc, I know you did all you could.
Thank you.
Good luck, Billy.
You know something?
I think he's gonna be okay.
I hope so.
- What was that he said about the short pass?
- It means he's gonna try.
Hey, Captain, what do you say we go over to Rosie's Bar and get a drink?
My treat.
- Thanks, Radar.
- Can you get drunk on grape Nehi?
I don't know.
Let's find out.
- What happened?
- Huh?
- What happened?
- Of course I'm not happy.
They hit me.
What do you want me to do?
Kiss it and make it better?
I want Corporal Klinger and Sergeant Zale court-martialed.
- Will that get me out of here?
- Out of here and into the stockade.
- One step too far.
- If we go to the stockade, we're not going alone.
- You wouldn't dare, you freak!
- Sticks and stones.
- Sir, what happens to officers who break regulations?
- Several of them.
They get busted and thrown in the stockade.
It's up to you.
Should we air our dirty lingerie in public, sir?
Uh, let's not.
Colonel, permission to drop all charges.
Permission granted.
Dismissed.
- I thought you handled that very well, sir.
- What?
- He said you're an idiot, Major.
- He said what?
I can't hear you.

#Are the stars out tonight #  No, they're not.
- #I don't know if it's cloudy or bright # -  Cloudy.
# 'Cause I only have eyes # Clamp.
- Clamp.
- Clamp.
Sorry, Doctor.
# For you, dear ## You seem preoccupied, Donovan.
Is anything wrong?
- No, nothing.
Thank you.
- If it's me, I can always move to another war.
Clamp.
Will you pipe down, Pierce!
We're working over here.
What do you think we're doing over here, playing hearts?
You're always looking for a fight.
I've certainly come to the right place.
Suture.
I don't mind singing in the O.R. I'm liable to bust out myself any minute.
Oh, go right ahead, Colonel.
It'll do your old heart middle-aged heart good, sir.
You certainly have a winning way, Junior.
- Colonel, I wonder if you could help me with a problem.
- Well, I hope so.
I haven't received a letter from my fiance in four days.
- You want me to write you one?
- Not much I can do, Major.
Maybe Penobscott's busy.
- Yeah.
Learning to write.
- I'll ignore that jealousy-inspired wisecrack.
- Has anybody been getting mail?
- Suture.
I've been getting fan mail from North Korea.
They want me to play Panmunjom after the war.
Peace talks are playing there now.
It's a tough act to follow.
I got mail.
I got a wonderful letter from my old Sunday school teacher.
Tell us about it, and I'll step on your foot.
I'm worried about Donald.
He works so hard.
- Maybe he strained himself thinking.
- Don't you wish.
He has a mind like a steel trap.
That could be dangerous.
If he gets an idea, he'll snap his neck and swallow his face.
I feel like Rip Van Winkle.
How long have we been in there?
Seven and a halfhours.
If I weren't certain of being knighted, I'd resign.
- I wasn't much help to you doctors.
- You were fine.
I'm afraid I've got too many things on my mind.
We all do.
I can't decide on who to ask to the movies tonight.
- I'll bet it isn't me.
- Don't be so sure.
- Well, how about you?
- You're asking me after him?
Well, he turned me down.
I'm on the rebound now.
This is your big chance.
- I don't play second fiddle.
- Forget the fiddle.
What do you play?
- Solitaire.
- Come on.
What do you say?
Dinner in the Mess Tent the room that floats in fat.
Followed by a rotten motion picture.
It's a perfect evening.
- I'm busy.
- Going to the auto show?
Post-op.
I'm helping B.J. Follow up on some cases.
You're doing time with Hunnicutt?
- Who sentenced you to that?
- I volunteered.
You're turning down a chance to be seen with the Porfirio Rubirosa of Ouijongbu.
- What a tongue twister.
- Oh, you've heard about me.
- Maybe next time, Captain.
- I'll have my florist send - an armful of pussy willows to your tent.
- It won't help.
How about a box of dehydrated chocolates?
- Poor girl's gone bonkers.
- Who, Donovan?
Yeah.
She turned down a chance to hold hands with me in the flicks tonight.
Ah.
Someday she'll look back and wanna pound her head on a rock.
Is she actually helping you out in post-op?
Is that so crazy?
You two got the mutual irresistables for each other?
Come on.
Tell me, who's the most devoted family man in the world?
Mickey Rooney.
- Who gets an "A" in fidelity?
- R.C.A. Victor.
No.
You, both times.
So how come she turns down a date with Dr. Jekyll - to go work in the lab with Mr. Hyde?
- She's helping me with cases.
I could use a little of that kind of help myself.
Hawk, her husband's back in the States and, uh, their marriage is in trouble.
Gee, I can't understand why.
They're only 12,000 miles apart.
She's really upset about it, and work's good therapy.
- Are you sure there's nothing going on between you two kids?
- Honest.
- A little hanky-panky after taps?
- Scout's honor.
- Before?
During?
- No.
- I'm happily married.
- Oh, yeah?
I thought that was a contradiction in terms.
Colonel, how'd you like a delicious cup of coffee?
- I'd love it.
- Me too.
This stuff stinks.
- I just don't understand why Donald hasn't written.
- Maybe there's another woman.
- Fat chance.
- Another man?
Donald is so devoted it's scary.
I can certainly tell when someone loves me.
When you kiss him, he clicks his heels.
- I can feel his loving arms all the way from Tokyo.
- Not bad for a stocky guy.
Maybe he's involved in some of that spy stuff, like parachuting into North Korea.
- That's possible.
- Is he qualified?
- He's made 126 jumps.
- Once from a plane.
Mail call, Colonel.
You got a letter from Mrs. Colonel.
- Bless the dear girl.
- Captain Hunnicutt, you got three from your wife.
- You got three?
- Gotta write 'em to get 'em.
Oh, I don't know.
Melville wrote Moby Dick, and he never wrote back.
- Probably on a cruise.
- Major Houlihan, a letter from your lieutenant colonel.
Oh!
Wonderful.
Wait a minute!
- This letter has been opened.
Look.
- Sometimes they come like that.
And sometimes they're opened by creepy company clerks who like to peek at intimate personal passages.
- Come on, Margaret.
That's uncalled for.
- It's not fair.
Yeah, and it wasn't even very intimate either.
- Nosy jerk.
- Come on, Margaret.
Smell your letter and read it.
- Oh, this is terrible.
- What is it?
- Did peace break out?
- It's Donald.
He's in Tokyo Army Hospital.
- What's wrong with him?
- He doesn't say, brave darling.
- Could be just a checkup.
- Maybe he's having a neck installed.
Or getting his upper lip starched.
You're just jealous because Donald is full-lipped.
- I'm getting excited.
- Eat your pudding.
- How you doing, Donovan?
- Okay.
Obviously.
Anything I can do?
- No.
- Bad news from home?
It's a letter from my old man a Dear Jane.
He started out with, uh, "Dear Carrie I just don't know how to tell you this".
But he found a way.
Yeah, he did.
Listen, uh, why don't you skip post-op tonight?
- No.
I'll be there.
- You don't have to.
I can handle it.
So can I. - Okay.
- B.J.?
- Yeah?
- Thank you.
Sure.
You know, when you're hurting, sometimes it helps to talk about it.
My wife bottles things up, keeps everything inside.
So I get in her way in the kitchen.
I keep nudging her till she gets sore enough to swing at me.
Then out it comes the anger, tears the problem everything.
- You must be a good husband.
- Yeah, but we miss a lot of dinners.
- Would you like to talk about it?
- N-No.
Thanks.
Just like Peggy stubborn.
I'll meet you in the kitchen.
- You can cork me two good ones.
-  To be honest, I'd like to talk.
But not here.
Someplace where we wouldn't be interrupted.
- How about Guam?
- How about my tent?
- Oh, that wouldn't do.
- Why not?
It wouldn't look right.
People might get the wrong idea.
You wanna talk in your tent, we'll talk in your tent.
After I'm finished here, I'll stop by.
Thanks, B.J. No problem.
Now beat it.
-  - Corporal!
Corporal O'Reilly!
- Betty!
-  - What are you doing!
- What?
- What am I doing?
I don't know.
- You kissed a superior officer!
- I did?
I didn't mean to.
- Why did you do that?
I don't know.
I was sleeping, and I was dreaming about - It's personal!
- Don't you ever do that again!
- I won't.
Never!
- Hurry up.
Get up.
I want you to make a call for me.
- Oh, okay.
- Get up.
I want you to call Tokyo.
- Tokyo Army Hospital.
- Right.
I got it.
I want to speak to Lieutenant Colonel Donald Penobscott.
- Yeah, I know.
He's your whatchamacallit.
- My fiance, Corporal!
Right.
Sparky?
Yeah, Sparky, listen.
Get me Tokyo Army Hospital, quick.
And we won't ever mention to Lt.
Col.
Penobscott about what just happened, will we?
- Oh, never, never, ever.
- 'Cause he's big and strong and insanely jealous.
- And he's got the bite of a bulldog.
- Who said that?
Nobody.
I mean, l-I just overheard it someplace.
- Are you working that thing?
- Yes, right!
Hello, Operator!
Yes.
Ma'am, please, get me Lt.
Donald Col.
Penobscott.
- A patient.
- A patient.
And it's an emergency.
- What's going on in here?
Who are you calling, Radar?
- Oh, it's for me, Colonel.
We're calling my fiance in Tokyo.
I've been worried sick.
What?
What, Operator?
- But Ma'am, he's not accepting any calls.
- What?
-  Leave a message.
- A message, Operator.
- Tell him to call Maj.
Margaret Houlihan.
- Call Maj.
Margaret Houlihan.
- MASH 4077.
- MASH 4077.
- Worried to death.
- Worried to death.
- Love and kisses.
- Love and kisses.
Aren't you in a premature panic, Major?
He's not taking any calls.
This could be very serious.
- Maybe he's just resting.
- Colonel, request permission to go to Tokyo and attend my fiance before he dies.
Why don't you relax, find out what's wrong.
I'll take a chopper in the morning to Kimpo and hitch a ride to Tokyo.
No, Major.
Let's be patient for another day.
I'm not tying up a chopper and losing a nurse just to find out Penobscott has a simple pimple on his butt.
"A simple pimple on his butt"?
Radar, where'd you get that lipstick?
Maj.
Houlihan.
It was an accident!
- I told you to keep your mouth shut!
- Right.
She did.
- It was an accident.
- Of course.
- Good night.
- Good night, Major.
Why don't you get some rest, Romeo?
I thought I had a good marriage.
The war killed it.
"I wish you were writing this letter instead of me.
"It'd be so much easier.
"I know I'll always love you.
- But I met someone" - Carrie.
I'm gonna make a little prediction.
One fine day, believe it or not, you'll get over all this.
The hurt will pass.
You'll forgive him, and you'll be ready to love again.
- It seems impossible.
- I know.
I know, but someday you'll be glad that guy's outta your hair.
- A new fella will come along.
-  Nice, bright guy a sucker for eyes like yours.
-  - And you'll start dating.
He'll fall madly in love with you.
And you'll turn around and clobber the poor slob.
-  - You want me to wake you up when you're finished eating?
I didn't get any sleep last night.
Gee, I dreamt I was dancing with Major Houlihan, and Betty Grable woke me up.
Somethin' like that.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- You were out awful late last night.
- Lots to do in post-op.
- You were gone when I woke up this morning.
- Couldn't sleep.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were out all night.
- Mm-hmm.
- You could've called.
- Mother and I were worried sick.
- Dad?
Shut up.
Ah, I hate to see them grow up.
I just hope you weren't wasting your time with some nurse.
Let's say I was sitting up with a sick friend.
Good.
Start at the beginning and tell me all about it.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Donovan, you look like a new woman, not that there was anything wrong with the old one.
- Thanks.
I feel better.
- Well, why shouldn't we all feel good?
Our work is so rewarding always lending a helping hand, doing unto others.
Hawk?
Your mouth runneth over.
I'm just teasing.
I mean, do I know what I'm saying?
Whatever it is, I don't mean it.
Should I go?
- Just stop talking.
- I will as soon as I get my foot out of my mouth.
I think I'll put it someplace else.
Ah, I'm being paged at the pool.
Well, you two carry on.
Strike that.
This is me leaving.
Here I go.
Bye.
So long.
- Hello?
- Hi.
Anybody in there?
I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm a little, uh, preoccupied.
- Anything wrong?
- Oh, no.
No.
I, uh I see you're trying the eggs.
You're braver than I am.
Will you excuse me, Carrie?
I've got a lot of work to do.
-  - One second, please.
- Major Houlihan.
- Major Burns.
- Am I disturbing you?
- Not yet.
Now you are.
What is it?
Firstly, may I say I'm sincerely unhappy your fiance is terribly sick.
He's not terribly sick.
All I know is that he's in the hospital.
Oh, when they don't tell you, it's usually pretty bad.
They haven't not told me.
I just haven't been able to find out.
And I'm sincerely not happy you're unhappy.
Thank you, Frank.
Anything else?
Oh, yes.
Uh, I have this little gift to present to you.
- Oh.
- It's just a little inexpensive token of sincerity.
How lovely.
A Japanese umbrella.
- Made in Texas.
- Thank you, Frank.
- That was very sweet.
- Well, giving is what it's all about.
We had a fine relationship once, Margaret and this just goes to prove that there's no hard feelings.
Oh, I get cranky at times, but we're still pals, okay?
- What a nice speech.
- It's off-the-cuff.
Thank you, Frank.
I hope we can always be friends.
Oh, why not?
I'm always ready if you need me.
I appreciate that, and I'm really anxious for you to meet Donald.
I think about you in here and me just across the compound.
- I think about the good times we had.
I'll never forget 'em.
- Neither will I, Frank.
- A lot of people knock this war, but I can't.
It gave me you.
- Oh, thank you.
Our friendship is real.
It's warm.
It's honest.
It's convenient.
- Frank!
- I'm doing my best, Margaret!
- But it's not enough.
I can't stand it anymore.
- Frank, stop it!
- Hold on to yourself!
- Not me!
You!
- Let go of me!
You fake!
You fake!
- Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
- Don't break it!
I can get my money back!
- You pretend you're my friend!
Take it home, you phony baloney!
Oh, Donald.
- How do you feel?
- Terrible.
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.
Nothing like an old fink to tell your troubles to.
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Come on.
Pour your heart out.
I'm a doctor.
I can fix it.
Hawk, you're looking at a guy that fell off the fidelity wagon.
I thought I heard a thump sometime last night.
And I'm miserable.
I'm a happily married man.
Not like Frank Burns is happy because his wife owns real estate.
I adore my wife and my kid and my marriage.
I know.
I don't like being unfaithful.
I'm not lookin' around.
- I'm lucky to have what I've got.
- You're right.
You are lucky.
God help me.
B.J., you stumbled last night.
That's all.
You were helping somebody, and it got out of hand.
- You made a mistake.
- I sure did.
- What's that?
- I'm writing Peg about it.
Wrong, wrong, wrong!
Don't be an idiot.
You made one lousy goof, and you wanna punish yourself, but don't punish her.
Do not tell Peg.
Don't tell anybody what you just told me.
- This will pass.
- Like a kidney stone.
Simply take a vow.
Raise your right hand.
Come on.
Come on.
I promise to be a good and faithful husband, to write nice, cheerful letters home to think of Peg often, and to keep my fat hands off Nurse Donovan.
Do you vow?
- I vow.
- I feel better about you already.
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.
There's probably a career for me in saving marriages.
You know, I'm gonna take a vow too.
- Good for you.
- I, Hawkeye Pierce, vow that someday I will take a vow just like his.
Amen.
But right now, I'm a little late for a very important date.
No time to say hello, good-bye.
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.
Lieutenant, what can I do you for?
Oh, uh, it's a personal problem, Colonel.
- Uh, my husband wants a divorce.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Stateside, is he?
- Yes, Colonel.
Well, it's a wonder we don't have more of this kind of casualty.
They say absence makes the heart grow fonder but I think that's a lot of buffalo bagels.
Excuse me.
Sit down, Donovan.
Um, I'd like a transfer, Colonel.
I'm making a mess of things here at 4077.
You volunteered for this duty, Lieutenant, and you've been doing good work.
- We need you.
- I'd be happier elsewhere.
If you've got problemspeople problems I'd like you to work them out.
They don't mean anything compared to what these boys are going through.
- Don't you agree?
- Yes, Colonel.
I don't want you leaving 'cause you're hitting a rough stretch of road.
Hang on for a while.
It's my opinion you can ride it out.
Okay?
- I'll try.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Colonel Potter, sir.
- What do you want, Klinger?
- Justice, sir.
- Justice in the army?
- You're crazy.
- You might say that, Colonel.
Uh-oh.
I don't like those moist eyes.
Sir, you ever heard of the Toledo Strangler?
No.
He's struck eight times.
The terror of Toledo.
- Kills only women motorcycle cops.
- So?
The fiend stands before you.
- You are the Toledo Strangler?
- I confess I am.
Extradite me.
Send me back to Toledo for a lengthy jury trial.
- Why do you do this, Klinger?
- The sirens, sir.
The sirens on the motorcycles drive me bananas.
- Have you read this?
- What do you mean?
It says here the last murder took place only two weeks ago.
This man's an imposter some nut trying to get in on my act.
Beat it, Klinger.
- But, sir, what about the newspaper clipping?
- What about it?
It says the killer's from Toledo and always uses a yellow scarf.
- I rest my case.
- Paste it in your scrapbook.
I could strangle somebody for you.
I don't mind auditioning.
- A person of your choice?
- Some other time.
Colonel, I don't expect you to buy everything I bring in here but maybe just once, okay?
Out, Klinger, before I call a woman motorcycle cop.
- Doctor?
Captain Hunnicutt.
- What's wrong?
This one looks shocky.
He's waxy, and his lips are blue.
- What are his vital signs?
- Pulse 120.
B.P. 94 over 52.
- Give me another unit of plasma.
- Right.
Nurse.
Yeah.
Thanks.
- It was a good pickup, Carrie.
Alert as hell.
- Thanks.
We're gonna have to watch him for a while.
- How are you feeling?
- Why do you ask?
- What?
- What do you care?
Those are the first civil words you've spoken to me in a week.
- You're exaggerating a bit, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.
You've been salty as hell, a bear with hangnails.
- I wasn't aware of it.
- Wanna talk about it?
- No.
- Why not?
'Cause the last time we talked, we didn't.
That's what we ought to talk about.
B.J., it's important to me.
Okay.
Nurse.
Keep an eye on him for a few minutes.
I'll be right outside.
I know how you feel.
You feel guilty, but you're blaming me.
No, I'm not.
I'm blaming myself.
Only partly.
I get your anger every time I come near you.
I don't need it.
Carrie, I'm sorry.
But you know what happened.
I got this enormous attack of the guilts.
I've never done that before.
I'm hopelessly, passionately in love with my wife.
- What's wrong with that?
- I don't want to mess that up.
I feel like I've betrayed her.
Why?
Because you were kind and considerate and sweet to me?
Because I was in despair one night, and you helped me through it?
Are you ashamed of it?
No, of course not, but there was more to it than that.
We didn't plan that.
We're still human beings, you know, no matter how hard we try not to be.
Yes, I know, and I'm still afraid.
- Of what?
- Of you.
Because you're right here and you're so attractive and so close.
- And so vulnerable.
- Yes.
- You don't trust yourself.
-  B.J., just because I'm across the compound doesn't mean you can waltz into my tent whenever you want to.
I needed you that night, and you were there.
I'll always love you for that.
It doesn't mean it's ever gonna happen again.
I can work out my own problem.
I don't expect you to be the answer to it.
Does that make it easier?
Yes and no.
We can be friends.
Yes, we can.
Closer than most.
Still friends.
Carrie you're very special.
I like you too.
Okay.
Let's go back to work, friend.
Hello!
Hello!
Lt.
Donald Col.
Penobscott?
Yes.
Maj.
Houlihan calling.
- Thank heaven!
- Thank Radar.
Donald?
Margaret.
How are you?
Oh, darling, I've been worried sick.
I was just saying l Colonel, Corporal, may I make my call in private, please?
- Certainly.
- Sure.
Donald, how are you?
Darling, what's happened to you?
Oh, no!
No!
Colonel, Corporal, come back in here, please!
- What is it, Major?
- It's Donald.
He's hurt himself a hernia doing the rope climb on the obstacle course.
Donald, you're always training so hard.
Colonel, request permission to go to him, please.
- We're very busy, Major.
- But he's had a hernia operation.
- We need you here.
- He won't let me go.
- It's this stupid war.
- She's right.
It's the war.
Colonel, Corporal, may I complete my call in private, please?
- He'll be out of action for about four weeks, Major.
- Never mind!
Donald, you've gotta be more careful!
The rope climb - A double hernia!
-  Eight weeks.
Oh, Donald!
Donald, you can't do this to me.
You have to be a little more considerate.
After all, you're an engaged person.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Did I ever tell you you look cute with your shirt off?
No.
I think I know why.
Now you made me lose count.
I gotta start all over again.
- Sleep!
I wanna sleep!
- Hoo-ha.
- Will you hold it down?
This is very distracting.
- Mail call, sirs.
Keep away from him.
He'll start all over again.
Captain B.J. Hunnicutt.
Something in a plain, brown envelope.
-  - They oughta disguise those things more.
- It's the Surgical Journal, Radar.
- Oh, yeah?
I seen one of those once.
I'd rather look at the outsides of people.
Hey, Hawkeye.
You got your newspaper from home.
- Get away from me with that.
- That's the Crabapple Cove Courier.
You love that.
I used to love it.
Same stupid news week after week.
Where's this month's Journal from the Institute for Applied Nudism?
Wanna read Major Burns's issue of Popular Mechanics?
Sometimes the ads go pretty far.
Radar, a picture of a three-way toilet valve does not go pretty far.
I just deliver 'em.
I don't make 'em up.
Look at this: "How to provide a gastric reservoir in a total resection of the stomach".
Look, if you can't read without moving your lips, at least turn the sound off.
- What's eating you?
- My back is eating me.
- Still?
- I have a hungry back.
- You want a massage?
- Not unless you put your shirt on.
- How about if I x-ray your back later?
- I did already.
- There's nothing there.
- Nothing?
No spine, nothing?
The pain goes clear through to my lung.
- I thought maybe I had a spot.
- Or a Fido or a Rover.
- Oh, you're really cute.
-  If I die from this, will you read the joke at my grave?
You know, I'd really dig that.
Criminy!
I'd rather read the stupid newspaper.
I'm gonna tell you right now what's gonna be in there.
Another article about incredibly average Vernon Parsons.
- Who's that?
- Some dunce I went through med school with.
Every week, he's in the newspaper.
He's being put in charge of this.
- He's being promoted to that.
- So what?
He's incredibly average.
The only reason he gets all this stuff is he's back there with no competition.
He's sitting back there, resting on his fallen arches.
I'm over here dancing with rats.
You'll live probably.
Listen to this "Transposition of the ileum in ascending colon".
- What an idiot that guy was.
- By the same guy who advocated total gastrectomy in '49.
- I read that.
Fascinating.
- Vernon must have his own press agent.
I can't pick up my hometown newspaper without reading his name.
Damn it!
There he is again!
"Dr. Vernon Parsons has been awarded a hundred thousand dollar grant at Boston Hospital for a two-year study of infectious disease in mice".
They oughta give him the disease and split the dough with the mice.
Don't they realize how incredibly average this man is?
I'm going to breakfast.
- Worse, huh?
- Do you see a knife handle sticking out of my back?
- Look, I hate to give advice.
- Good.
- You never exercise.
- I wrestle periodically with the nurses.
If you'd just do something physical once in a while, you'd feel better.
You're right.
I feel a lot better.
Father, you feeling a bit under the weather today?
- I have been dragging a bit.
- Not eating, I see.
- Food seems to have lost its allure.
- Can I eat your sausage, Father?
- By all means, Radar.
- They're really good today.
Extra grease.
If you'll pardon the indelicacy, Father, and with all due respect to your collar, why don't you stop by the dispensary and get a good flushing out?
-  - We got here too late for the hard-boiled eggs.
All they have is scrambled socks.
You should've been in the army before they taught chickens to lay powdered eggs.
World War One, I ate turnips for breakfast every day for a month.
- My tongue smelled like Arthur Murray's footbath.
- You feeling all right, Father?
- Why do you ask?
- You keep pulling at your fingers.
- They too close to your hands?
- I seem to be a little arthritic this morning.
- Off his feed too.
- You gonna finish your coffee, Father?
No, no.
Go right ahead, Radar.
Let me see your eyes, Father.
What do you think, Colonel?
How's his sclera?
Slightly icteric.
Let's see underneath your tongue, Father.
- That tongue's as yellow as the streak down my back.
- Don't touch that coffee, Radar.
- Why?
- The "Swiss Family Hepatitis" is swimming around in there.
Oh!
Gee!
Ooh, ick!
I ate his sausage.
- Well, I didn't touch them.
- I know, Father.
But it was yours.
I mean, no offense, but, wow ooh, ick!
Let's nip this in the bud.
I don't want to live through another outbreak of camp jaundice.
B.J., give Father Mulcahy a blood test.
Hawkeye, examine the staff.
Give 'em a shot of gamma globulin.
Radar, check the latrine area.
See if the water supply's polluted.
I'll talk to the cook.
- Let's get busy.
-  Come on, Father.
It was just laying out there in the open.
I wasn't going through your private papers.
- Relax, Frank.
I just wanna see your body.
- Don't be such a rude rodney.
- Frank, there's hepatitis going around.
- Hepatitis?
- Yeah.
Let me see your eyes.
- Are they yellow?
- How's my liver?
Is it tender?
- How should I know?
It's your liver.
Well, feel it.
- How does that feel?
-  Tickles.
- Frank, try to control yourself.
- Something's wrong with me.
- Yeah?
Ever since Margaret got engaged?
- No!
Since I've been getting shortness of breath and heart palpitations.
- Feel my chest.
- Not tonight, darling.
I have a headache.
I have a lump here under the sternum, and that's not supposed to be there.
- Is it?
- Frank, go like this.
Feels like a marble.
Not like an aggie, more like an immie.
Look, I haven't got time to feel in your chest for marbles.
Let me get some blood.
I'll give you a shot in the behind, and I'll get out of here.
Look, while you're here?
- Mm-hmm?
- Will you check my arms?
I think my arms are getting longer.
Take two bananas and call me in the morning.
- Feel under my armpit.
- Not for five bucks.
I've got swollen nodes, and they're getting bigger and bigger.
- You know, I saw that in a movie once?
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
This guy's nodes got so big, eventually they took over Minneapolis.
And you call yourself a doctor.
Frank, will you for cripe's sake drop your driveling your hypochondria and your pants in that order.
You're not such hot stuff.
I just read about someone from your hometown.
He got a hundred thousand dollar grant from Boston Hospital for playing with mice.
Don't taunt me, Frank.
I'm holding a sharp object.
A hundred thousand smackers.
That's probably a thousand bucks a mouse.
Ow!
Ouch, that hurts!
Take it out!
It hurts!
Take it out!
- I already took it out, Frank.
- Feels like you left a rock in there.
Maybe one slipped down from your head.
You broke off a needle in me, didn't ya?
These few, lovely moments with you have contributed more to the pain in my back then my army cot, and that's going some.
If you care anything about human life, you'll feel my lumps before you go.
Leave 'em under my pillow.
I'll give 'em a squeeze before I go to sleep.
-  - Come in.
- I have to have a look at your body, Margaret.
- Ha-ha, don't you wish.
- Lie down in the bed and let me feel your liver.
- That'll be the day.
- Get out of here.
- Margaret, we may be facing a hepatitis epidemic.
- I have to examine you.
You're gonna get a shot too.
- So are you, kiddo.
Let's start small.
Show me your eyes.
- Outside.
This bulb is too yellow.
- You're serious, aren't you?
Believe me.
I wouldn't be walking around poking people's livers if I didn't have to.
- All right.
Show me under your tongue.
- No.
That's out.
- What?
- I will not show you my tongue.
Especially not underneath.
- How 'bout if I show you mine first?
- I can look at my own tongue.
- It's okay.
- Okay?
It's gorgeous.
- I knew it.
- I have to have some blood.
Let me have a vein.
Here.
Hurry up.
Well, you're certainly braver about this than my last patient.
- Who was that?
- Frank.
-  - He's afraid his body's being attacked.
He has very little to worry about.
How's your fiance Lieutenant Colonel Donald Penobscott of West Point?
Fine.
He's doing very well.
Well, that certainly sounds extremely satisfactory.
- Can I confide in you?
- Sure.
I've been getting some very strange letters from Donald's mother.
- Like what?
- Like she's welcoming me into the family.
Well, listen.
You're not all that bad.
She's welcoming me, but in a very left-handed way.
Listen to this.
"Dear Margaret, What a pleasure it will be to include a Houlihan in our clan.
"I've only known two Houlihans before, and they were both charming.
"One was a chauffeur, who we liked very much "although we had to let him go because he drank.
"And the other was a young girl who worked for us as a maid.
We still send her Christmas cards every year at the state hospital".
If this woman wants to start a fan club for you, tell her to forget it.
She has me sick.
I don't know what she's telling Donald.
What difference does it make?
He loves you.
He's not in love with the chauffeur.
Ready?
- Come on, Margaret.
You're taking all the fun out of it.
- Yes, that's right.
I am.
Margaret, this is not merely a dream come true.
- Gamma globulin goes better in a person's caboose.
- Not this person's.
- Margaret, you're a nurse.
- Oh, all right.
Let's get it over with.
My sentiments exactly.
Let us not dawdle over a moment like this.
Let us treat it as a professional encounter of the most Oh, Margaret, may I pause on this occasion to express a few thoughts?
- If you say one word - Oh, I wouldn't, I wouldn't.
Not a word.
But-But if I did, that word would be "magnificent".
Would that be bad?
- Will you please give me the shot?
- Okay.
Okay.
There.
How dare you come in here on the pretext of giving me a shot and then stand there ogling me as though I were a sideshow attraction.
Boy, I show you a little appreciation, and you hit the roof.
- What do you want from me?
- Respect.
Simple respect.
I expect nothing more, and I'll accept nothing less.
Hey, that's pretty good.
You got me with that.
- Good.
- I mean, you really did.
I bet that would work with Donald's mother.
- What?
- Maybe not those words, but that attitude.
- Simple respect.
- Maybe.
You know, in some ways, you really are magnificent.
- And not just on the outside.
- Thank you.
- You wanna give me a shot?
- Buzz off!
Just asking.
Attention all personnel.
Incoming.
Incoming.
Welcoming committee to the helipad.
There will be a slight lull in our lull.
Welcoming committee to the helipad.
There will be a slight lull in our lull.
I don't know what we're gonna do with this boy over here.
- Oh, God.
- I sent for Hawkeye.
- I think we need another opinion.
- How'd this happen?
He's a tank driver.
When a shell gets inside one of those tubs it just ricochets around, chews up everything in its path.
- Where do you start?
- I'm here.
What's the matter with you?
You're all bent over.
- Who told you?
- You're turning into a question mark.
And the question is how I got this way.
Pretty bad, huh?
Among other things, he has no stomach to speak of.
- I know they could deal with this down in Seoul.
- But the trip might kill him.
And if one of us tried it up here, we might kill him.
- What do you think?
- You're the chief surgeon.
You tell me.
He'll need a partial gastrectomy, maybe even a total.
I think B.J. oughta do it.
He's the closest we come to an expert on this.
Expert?
I've never done this before.
I've only read about it.
Well, that puts you one up on the rest of us.
Work from the book.
- Suppose I make a mistake?
- Suppose we send him down to Seoul on the buckboard express?
- He'll be off your conscience, but he won't be any more alive.
- It's a tough choice.
Fine.
Take your time.
What are you gonna do?
All right.
I'll do it.
Look at this.
I'm sweating already.
Go scrub.
Carmine, prep him.
Pierce, see me in my office later about your back.
Why?
Is something wrong with my back?
"In the colon, transected" - What the hell are you doing?
- I wanna see if you got hepatitis - before you put your hands in that guy.
- I gave myself a blood test.
- Leave me alone, will ya?
- Mind if I give you a shot while you're scrubbing up?
I'm trying to read.
Will you get out of here?
Look, I gotta jab 15 people before I go to sleep tonight.
- Otherwise this entire staff will be flat on its livers.
- See me after the operation.
I'll be waiting at the stage door with a flower in my buttonhole.
- The Swamp, 10:00.
- Good luck, Beej.
Let's see, "The terminal ileum is divided five inches proximal to the ileocecal valve".
God.
Let's jump to the end and see how this operation turns out.
- How you feeling, Father?
- Uh, fine actually.
- Well, weak, really.
- I brought you some juice.
- Oh, thank you.
- Your blood test showed hepatitis.
Probably infectious.
We're gonna have to isolate you for a week or so.
You mean I can't see people?
How will I hear confessions tomorrow night?
Well, maybe they can write their sins on pieces of paper and slip them under the door.
- Possibly.
- Then we can auction off the pieces of paper and make a fortune for the orphanage.
How am I going to administer the sacraments?
How can I give Holy Communion?
I can't place the Eucharist on their tongues.
- I'll infect them all.
- You're gonna have to take a rain check for a while.
What if somebody needs last rites in the O.R.?
People are depending on me.
I really don't feel all that bad, you know.
- You wanna kill yourself?
- Well, at least let's rig up something so I can hear confessions through a flap in the tent.
- Father, you have to rest a little.
- No, no, no, no.
Look here.
You don't understand.
Their souls are in my charge.
- Father, you're sick.
- Well, so are you.
Look at your back.
That's not stopping you from doing your work.
All right.
I'll work out a light confession schedule for you.
Maybe people can cut down on their sinning and give you a break.
- I'm hearing confessions, and that's it.
- All right.
Get a little rest.
Nobody's pushing me around.
Good afternoon, Klinger.
I'm checking for hepatitis.
- Drop your pants and show me your eyes.
- Forget it, sir.
The last time I dropped my pants, they put me in the army.
The next time I drop 'em, it's to stick 'em out the porthole and wave bye-bye.
- How are your eyes?
- Bloodshot from pounding potatoes.
Come on, Klinger.
I want to get home and slip into some comfortable traction.
Here.
They look like potato eyes, right?
You are what you mash.
- Show me your tongue.
- Gladly.
- Let me see the underside.
- Wait, I'll stand on my head.
What are you so cranky about?
Because I drew K.P. 30 straight days for punching out Zale.
I should get a medal for that.
We're supposed to fight the enemy, aren't we?
You're fighting Zale again?
What about?
Aw, it's stupid.
He insulted the Toledo Mud Hens.
I take it that's a baseball team and not yesterday's lunch.
The trouble is I got a short fuse.
My wife, Laverne, keeps writing me, "When you get angry, count to 10 and ask St. Anthony for help".
I go one, two, three pow!
Once I got to eight.
I never needed any help from St. Anthony.
- I'm too hot-blooded.
- Let me draw a little of that hot blood from your vein.
- I really gotta work on it.
- Yeah, right.
- I can't stand myself when I lose my temper.
- Hold still, will ya?
Sure.
So he insults the Mud Hens.
What does he know?
I should get excited over an ignorant remark from a stupid idiot like him?
- Hold it, will ya?
Talk with the other hand.
- Sure.
I'm not wasting my time on him.
That dumb jerk!
- Excuse me.
- You want me to stab myself?
Just hold still.
- Right.
- All right?
He's always making cracks about my lingerie.
He just doesn't have the guts.
I'd like to see him in a panty girdle!
Sorry.
I didn't mean to raise my voice.
Can I have a little cooperation?
The pain in my back is beginning to grow roots.
I gotta calm down.
I don't care what he says about me.
But he mentions the Mud Hens again, he's getting it right in the puss!
- Will you watch it?
- I'm sorry.
Did I hurt ya?
Fortunately, I'm in a permanent duck.
Look, during a physical examination, I'm supposed to get physical, not you.
- Now get over there.
- Sir.
- Give me that.
- Here, take it.
- Sir?
- Uh-huh?
If you find out I got hepatitis, I'm gonna kiss Zale right on the mouth.
I'm very happy for you.
"The ileocolic segment is turned upward and the end of the ileum anastomosed to the end of the esophagus" blues.
Everything under control?
You know what this reminds me of?
Assembling those toys I got as a kid.
Fold Flap "A" into Slot "B".
I could never tell my flap from my slot.
- You can't find that kid's Flap "A," don't guess.
- I'm all right.
It's amazing how much you can tell from a few drops of blood though, isn't it?
- Yep.
- You could tell everything from a guy's blood, can't you?
Everything that's fit to print.
- It's really sort of fascinating, isn't it?
- I'm all a-tingle myself.
- What are you worried about, Radar?
- Oh, nothing, uh.
Well, I mean, it was just that I was wondering if if you could tell if a guy has any, you know, special problems.
Like, uh, like he's anemic or, uh, he isn't red-blooded enough or - What's the matter?
- Well, I'll tell ya.
Um, sometimes I go out with the guys.
You know, like to Rosie's Bar?
We really have a good time.
We're always, uh, singing and laughing and telling what we're gonna do after the war.
Then a couple of guys will start joking with some of the business girls.
And before I know it, I start to feel different.
- Different?
- I get sleepy.
And you're afraid there's something wrong with you?
No.
Is there?
Yeah.
You're suffering from a severe case of decency.
I mean, I really wish I could have a good time like they do, you know?
I mean, just bust out and drink and tell lies to strange girls and come back to camp the next morning without any sleep and throw up all day.
I really wish I could at least just once.
Look, everybody's different, Radar.
You're here with a bunch of guys you'll probably never see again.
You don't have to try to be like them.
You know, most people act crazy when they're out of town.
- Hmm.
- But you're different.
You always take a little bit of Iowa with you wherever you go.
That's nice.
Don't try to change that.
Someday you'll meet somebody that you'd like to introduce to your mom.
And instead of taking advantage of her you'll offer her a gift you've been working on all your life.
Yourself.
And believe me, you won't get sleepy.
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
I hate to say this at this point, but would you drop your pants?
Now, the first time they did this operation they came up with an ileocolic segment that was gangrenous.
This guy doesn't even have that end of his ileum, so I guess we can forget that.
Did you do a splenectomy, or did the shell fragment do it for you?
I did some.
The North Koreans did the rest.
My God, don't they know this poor guy's still got a few payments left on his house?
I guess his neighbors down at the draft board didn't mention that in his letter of reference.
- Cut.
- It looks to me like you oughta bejust about done.
One more stitch, I'll be ready to start closing.
How's he doing?
Stable, Doctor.
I think he's going to make it.
Cut.
There.
I just knitted a soldier.
- ## - I was supposed to give you a shot in the Swamp at 10:00.
- What are you doing here?
- Hawkeye, Hawkeye, Hawkeye, Hawkeye, Hawkeye!
I did it!
I saved him.
He's alive!
- Louis Pasteur couldn't have put it better.
- I'm a life-giver.
Congratulations.
Really, I mean it.
Show me your tongue.
My tongue?
That's small potatoes.
I'll show you my butt!
Hey!
Hey, everybody.
All right, all right, all right.
All right.
- Give me your attention.
- A simple "Ah" would be sufficient.
In celebration of the world's most difficult surgery and the world's most wonderful surgeon snatching life out of the jaws of death we unveil for you now, the Hippocrates of Ouijongbu.
##  - ##  - Dip, Baker, dip!
##   - Uh-huh.
- There's no contamination of the water supply.
The patient we had here three weeks ago showed up in Seoul with a severe case of infectious hepatitis.
Let's hope Father Mulcahy caught it from him, and this will be the end of it.
I'm for that.
- Okay.
Now, what's with you?
- What's with me?
You been walking around like Lon Chaney's stand-in.
At first I thought it was pleurisy.
Then I thought maybe a disc.
- I don't know what it is.
- I hear you've been reading your hometown newspaper.
You think they're poisoning the ink?
I think maybe you haven't made up your mind how you feel about being over here, feeding the fleas.
As far as I'm concerned, the fleas can eat out at the Chinese restaurant down the street.
How do you feel about spending the war over here, even though you're not incredibly average.
- I guess I'm angry.
- How do you feel about being angry?
You think I'm mad, and I won't admit it, huh?
I think you're gonna come out of this war with a merit badge for tying yourself up in knots.
Here, take a belt of that.
Can I tell you something as a friend?
A tough friend?
Tough friends last longer.
When I was an enlisted man, I was short.
Not like I am now.
For a while there, I thought I'd look taller if I could knock a few of the big guys flat on their backs.
Then it dawned on me.
I was just fighting myself and using their ribs to hurt my hands on.
Fig Newtons and Scotch.
Listen, it's too big a world to be in competition with everybody else.
The only guy I have to get better than is who I am right now.
And in your case, that's tough enough.
They're great if you dunk 'em.
So what do I do about incredibly average Vernon Parsons?
Relax.
Let him have his little research grant.
Live and let live.
And then just to give yourself a little present, send him an anonymous letter.
That's not a bad idea.
I could tell him I saw him cheating on an exam once.
Tell him you're filing a malpractice suit.
- I'm beginning to feel better.
- Tell him you're filing a paternity suit.
Doctor, Doctor, I can walk.
- Hey, B. J!
- Quiet.
Quiet.
- You know what your trouble is?
- Yes, I'm dying.
- That's not your trouble.
- Right.
My trouble is I'm not dying fast enough.
- You don't get enough exercise.
- Uh-huh.
The cure for a hangover is to get the blood out of your keister and into your brain.
- Watch this.
- What?
Hey, Hawkeye, come on.
Don't do that.
That's dangerous.
Are you kidding?
I'm in perfect control.
Come on.
Don't fool around, Hawkeye.
- Ow!
My head.
-  My back!
- My head!
-  My back!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Let's say, in the next war, the generals strip down to their B.V.D.'s and have at it with baseball bats while the rest of us stay home.
That is so like you, Hunnicutt.
Not a patriotic bone in your body.
No wonder the man flunked anatomy.
He thinks there are patriotic bones.
- Four-oh silk.
- We only have three-oh.
I'll take three-oh, and you'll owe me one.
You just don't understand people wanting to fight for their country.
Sure I do, but it isn't my country.
Don't you realize that if we weren't here, the Commies would overrun the whole darn place?
Serve 'em right.
The weather stinks, and the food's lousy.
And the room service leaves a lot to be desired.
-  Sponge.
-  Sponge.
Those Commies think they can run the world.
Let's see 'em try to run Newark.
- In two weeks, they'd end up in the trunk of a Buick.
-  - Sir, there's a Colonel Bidwell to see you.
- Tell him I'm busy.
He said, if you said you were busy, I was to say it's urgent.
You can tell him to take a flying leap - I'll be out when I'm finished.
- That's what I told him.
- Colonel Potter?
- Right.
I'm Colonel Bidwell, "l" Corps Operations Officer.
- What can I do for you?
- Who's your best doctor?
- Why do you wanna know?
- Will you answer the question, please?
We have several good men.
- Do you have one who's outstanding?
- Yes, we do.
- What's his name, Colonel?
- Our best man is Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce.
- I'll take him.
- For what?
Personal physician to General Theodore A. Korshak, "l" Corps Commander.
- Korshak?
"Tamer of the Tiger Tank"?
- None other.
- Pierce isn't your man.
- He is if he's the best.
If General Korshak were being carried in on a stretcher I'd say Pierce is the fella you want.
But a personal physician?
No, sirree.
- Why not?
- Because Pierce is a maverick from the top of his unshorn head to the tips of his uncut toenails.
- You're saying he's not G.I. - He isn't even housebroken.
I appreciate your candor, but I still want to meet him.
Whatever you say.
He's in O.R. Right now.
Nurse.
Listen, Bidwell.
A lot of men are alive today because Pierce works here.
- I don't wanna lose him.
- Are you suggesting the general settle for second best?
Are you suggesting we should?
You ever get the feeling there's a war going on?
There's always a war going on.
War is the world's favorite spectator sport.
- Give me some more skin sutures.
- Everybody knows war is hell.
Remember, you heard it here last.
War isn't hell.
War is war, and hell is hell.
And of the two, war is a lot worse.
- How do you figure that, Hawkeye?
- Easy, Father.
Tell me, who goes to hell?
- Sinners, I believe.
- Exactly.
There are no innocent bystanders in hell.
But war is chockfull of them little kids, cripples, old ladies.
Except for a few of the brass, almost everybody involved is an innocent bystander.
Well, I'm not.
I'm here because my country needs me.
How do you know it wasn't just some excuse to ship you The Korean War was invented so your parents wouldn't come looking for you.
You're a pair of sickos!
I'm not getting a pulse.
No.
- No pulse.
- Amanda!
Adrenaline!
Bag 'im!
Gloria!
Bicarb!
Where's the adrenaline?
Into the I.V. Tubing.
Come on!
Come on, damn it!
I'm gonna go inside.
Give me a knife.
Rib spreader!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Come on.
Come on.
Live, damn it.
Live.
Don't let the bastard win.
I'm getting a pulse.
It's getting better.
All right.
Let's close up.
Chest tube.
- Pressure's coming up.
-  Nice goin', Hawk.
- Klinger.
- Get the new sutures going.
- Congratulations, son.
- I guess it just wasn't his turn.
That's right.
If it had been his turn, you would've worked on him.
Comin' through!
- Hey, do me a big favor, will ya, pal?
- What, Doctor?
- Move it or get it amputated.
- I beg your pardon?
Don't beg.
Just get your butt outta here.
Give me the scissors.
You keep loading those sutures.
- Seen enough, Colonel?
- A little hot-tempered, isn't he?
Yes, and this is one of his cooler days.
Well, I told you Pierce wasn't the man you were looking for.
Fine doctor, but undisciplined.
I should add he hates brass.
I'll include that in my report to the general.
According to Pierce, the only medical attention generals require is a daily high colonic.
Incredible.
Have a good trip back.
Sorry you had to waste all this time.
- Listen, Potter.
- Yes, Colonel?
In the operating room, when Pierce was trying to save that man's life, he said "Don't let the bastard win".
Who was he talking about?
Death.
When it comes to death, Pierce is a sore loser.
It's a part of life, part of war.
And we're soldiers.
Maybe we are, but Pierce isn't.
He's just humoring us by wearing that uniform.
He's one doctor who'll never be nonchalant where death is concerned.
He'll always take it personally.
He could crack up with that attitude.
You're right.
He's a good man to stay away from.
- Colonel.
- Sayonara.
Sometimes I get the feeling we're only a bunch of mechanics.
- Mechanics?
- Sure.
Doctors fix people up, so they can go on living.
We fix them up, so they can go back and get killed.
We're running a body-and-fender shop at a demolition derby.
Well, I'm not a mechanic.
I'm a surgeon and a gentleman.
He uses the right fork and the wrong knife.
When his patient dies, he always says "Excuse me" before leaving the table.
There's nothing wrong with manners.
We all heard how Pierce talked to that visiting colonel.
He gave the 4077 th a black eye.
You gave it a black armband.
That man was a general's aide.
Where would we be without leadership?
I'd be in the backseat of a '46 DeSoto "schnuggling" with Wanda Lamperski.
- Hi, Radar.
- Hey, Mulligan.
I hear you're going home.
Yeah.
I finally got my points.
First stop Seoul, and then I'm Bitter Creek bound.
- You're what?
- Bitter Creek.
- A small town in Wyoming.
That's where I'm from.
- Oh.
I just wanted to tell you good-bye.
Hey, gee, thanks, Mulligan.
Good luck to you.
There is something I'd like you to do for me something I'd like you to take care of.
Yeah?
Go ahead, sit down.
- What is it?
- Well, it's, uh, very precious and, uh very beautiful.
Is it a bird or somethin'?
Nah, it's a girl.
A girl?
- You mean, a girl?
- That's right.
Look, Radar, you're a real nice, gentle guy, and l I want you to be her friend.
Yeah?
Well, her name's Mai Ping.
I've told her all about you.
She's waiting for you over at Rosie's Bar.
Oh, boy.
A real girl.
Mai Ping, this is Radar.
- Uh, O'Reilly.
- Radar O'Reilly.
Actually, my name is Walter, but only my mother calls me that.
Treat her nice, okay?
Good-bye, Mai Ping.
Please sit down, Walter.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oh, would you like a drink?
They serve a nice grape Nehi here.
Oh, no, thank you.
- Are you from Korea?
- Oh, yes.
I am Korean.
- And you?
- I'm just here for the war.
It's a pretty country, except where it's bombed.
Mmm.
You have any hobbies?
You like sports?
Mmm, no, I don't.
- Uh, would you like to take a walk?
- Yes.
Shall I show you my hut?
Your what?
Your hut?
Now?
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, can I help you?
- Mmm.
- Hey, there's a baby in your basket.
- Yes, there is.
- Is he your brother?
- He's my son.
Lee Chin.
- Lee Chin Mulligan?
- Yes.
Ah, that's nice.
-  - Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Have you ever really considered the foot?
Yeah, but I prefer girls.
Look at it.
The foot is an incredible thing.
- What's so hot about a foot?
- You can stand on 'em.
You can walk on 'em.
You can kick people in the tush with 'em.
You sold me.
I'll take a pair in my size.
There are none in your size.
- Ah, welcome to our hovel.
- It's not much, but it's close to where we live.
- And only minutes to the nearest war.
- I'm glad you like it here.
- I nearly lost Hawkeye today.
- In a poker game?
I'd never throw you into the pot unless I had at least two pair.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Ever hear of General Korshak?
Is he related to "General Chaos"?
Same guy.
General Ted Korshak sent that colonel up here.
- That bozo in the O.R.?
- Yep.
Looking for a personal physician for the general.
- Why?
- Prestige.
Found out some other three-star had his own doctor and decided he couldn't live without one.
Actually, for the doctor, it's easy duty.
You eat well, hotel beds, and the hours aren't bad.
- So the colonel was lookin' me over, huh?
- Yep.
- And I blew my big chance.
- It was the way you acted in O.R.
He thought you were crude, rude and unmilitary.
- A triple threat.
- And I wasn't even wearing my swim fins.
You were absolutely disgraceful and I think I'll buy you a drink.
You're not gonna like him, General.
- Gave you a lot of static, huh?
- Yes, sir.
- Downright insolent.
A real hardnose.
- That makes two of us.
- Hi, Radar.
- Oh, hi, Klinger.
How's it goin'?
Marvelous.
I love peeling these little fellas.
- I'm considering it as a career.
- Oh, that's neat.
- Hey, Radar.
There's a new invention just came out.
- Yeah?
It's really catching on.
It's called the bag.
Thanks.
Listen, Klinger, this isn't for me, you know?
What do I care who they're for, as long as I don't have to peel 'em?
- Oh.
- Take a couple more while we got 'em.
Little kids need eggs.
Oh.
Thanks a lot, Klinger.
- How do you like bein' a father?
- Oh, I'm not the father.
- I'm sort of the foster uncle.
-  Do kids like 'em scrambled?
How's it feel to be a family man, Radar?
- I worry a lot.
- What about?
About the baby.
Geez, how's he gonna get along?
I mean, he's so, uh He's so small and little.
Whenever I'm not with him, I worry.
And when I'm there, I worry even more.
- You're a good father, Radar.
- I'm not the father.
I know.
You're still a good father.
Thanks.
- What's it like being the real thing?
- You worry a lot.
Geez.
I get antsy if even a day goes by, and I don't see little Lee Chin.
And I'm just his uncle.
I mean, I'm not really his uncle, of course.
- Are you and Mai Ping - What?
- Nothin'.
- Oh, no, nothin' like that.
We're just friends.
I envy you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Gee, and you a doctor and an officer.
You got a family, Radar.
Take my word for it.
It's better than either of those things.
Well, I really appreciate you coming along to give the baby a checkup.
- No problem.
- You know, sometimes he cries.
What do you think that is?
You think he's just hungry or something?
Could be, pal.
There's a lot of it goin' around.
This way, General.
Mildred, just another 14 months and 11 days till retirement.
- Ah!
General.
- At ease, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.
- General Korshak, Colonel Potter.
Pleased to meet you, General.
Is there anything I can do for you?
- Well, you could put me out of my misery.
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm parched.
- Oh, certainly.
- Colonel?
- Thanks.
- Mmm.
Good scotch.
- Thank you, General.
Is that all you wanted?
Sit down, Colonel.
You have a tough guy on your staff here, name of Pierce.
Bidwell tells me he's a piece of real live ammo.
Did the colonel tell you he hates generals more than watered gin and earaches put together?
Me too.
Never met one yet that was worth his weight in Spam.
If Pierce wants an argument, he's gonna have to do a lot better than that.
- I think he can, General.
Oh.
- Just what the doctor ordered.
I'd like to meet my new personal physician.
Now.
- Is he okay?
- Fit as a fiddle and ready for love.
- What?
- Lee Chin is just fine.
Thank you.
Would you like some tea?
No, thanks.
I've gotta get back.
The army's a lot like the A.M. A both frown on house calls.
- Here we are.
- Here we go.
Oh, what a big boy.
- Hey, B.J. - Mm-hmm?
I really appreciate this.
This was swell of ya.
No problem, Radar.
You have a beautiful family.
Bye.
He's very healthy.
- Walter.
- Hmm?
He looks like you.
- You think so?
- Oh, yes.
He's very handsome.
Well, maybe the eyes.
I hear you're a real pistol, Doc.
Only when I'm loaded.
I'm not much of a doctor once you get to know me.
- According to Potter, you're the best.
- Well, the colonel drinks.
Only in groups of one or more.
What's your medical background, Captain?
Typical.
I had all the childhood diseases.
Mumps, measles, colic you name it.
- You are insolent.
- Well.
Seriously, where'd you study?
I never studied seriously.
If I hadn't cheated on the final exam and been a personal friend of the cadavers, I never would've graduated.
- And that was high school.
- This guy kills me.
What higher praise for a physician?
I want this man.
Uh, General, I'd really rather not be your personal physician or your court jester, or whatever it is you're shopping for.
Do you realize what an opportunity I'm offering you, Captain?
Sure.
The moon, the stars, your high school letterman's sweater.
Same deal I offered Nurse Baker last night.
Pierce, I have enough ribbons and medals to to cover that wall.
Well, bring 'em around.
It'll liven up the place.
I'm not movin' those pictures.
Ribbons and medals don't mean a thing.
These are a different matter.
- These you have to go out and get for yourself.
- You mean, they don't deliver?
You don't get them by taking "no" for an answer.
- You see this?
- What?
There's supposed to be a medical insignia there, a caduceus.
I probably dropped it in a patient.
You know how I got that?
I mean, if it was there.
- By working your butt off?
- That's right.
So as long as I have to be in Korea why don't you let me do what I was trained to do be a doctor.
Okay.
Let's see you in action.
- How is it, Doc?
- It's awfully high.
You almost rang the bell.
- Blame it on the major.
- Thank you very kindly, sir.
I wonder whether you know my fiance Lieutenant Colonel Donald Penobscott.
He's stationed in Tokyo.
He's a great admirer of yours, General.
- I know a Penobscott no neck, one eyebrow.
- That's him!
- One eyebrow?
- Mmm.
- Over which eye.
- Both.
Oh, yeah.
Cro-Magnon.
- It's very sexy.
- Come on, General.
We'll take some dirty pictures of your lungs.
- You're really somethin'.
-   - Hi, sweetheart.
- Mulligan.
Oh.
I got to Seoul.
I was practically on the plane when when I realized I couldn't leave you and the baby.
I love you, Mai Ping.
I love you, Mulligan.
I guess we can go to Bitter Creek together, huh?
Bitter Creek sounds nice.
Hey, uh, thanks for, uh everything, Radar.
Oh, heck.
It wasn't everything.
I just took care of the baby.
That's all.
He's a terrific baby.
I didn't, uh There we go.
Oh, hey, listen.
I borrowed your slippers.
They're They're really nice.
I enjoyed them.
Um, I guess I don't have to put these on.
Colonel Potter needs me.
I'm sure.
I knew you were coming back.
I think that's terrific.
Um I gotta fill out the monthly report.
Walter.
Thanks.
Bye.
Okay, okay.
I'll do anything you say except give up my stogies and my scotch.
- Then I might as well sign on as your personal physician.
- Good.
- As long as I can come back here after the funeral.
- What funeral?
Yours.
You're looking for a doctor to keep you alive and you're doing everything you can to kill yourself.
I'm in pretty good shape for a man my age.
- You are if you're 103.
- Not funny, Pierce.
The stroke that's headed your way is a lulu.
It could come today, tomorrow or next Tuesday.
- Or never, right?
- Wrong.
Six months at the outside.
- How do you know that?
- I'm a doctor.
See?
- How do you know that?
- I'm a doctor.
See?
You got high blood pressure, General.
You drink, you smoke.
You're 20 pounds overweight without the medals.
There are two ways you can avoid a stroke.
One go to Tokyo, check into a hospital, start taking care of yourself.
- Two?
- Sit on a land mine.
If you're trying to scare me, young man, you're not succeeding.
Look, you're lucky.
You have a choice.
Unlike the other guys who come through here, it's up to you whether you live or die.
Can't do it, Pierce.
I've got a war to fight.
Okay.
Your next foxhole will be six feet deep.
You really lay it on with a shovel, don't you?
- I'm not kidding!
- Neither am I. Start packing.
You'll get your orders.
- Driver.
- Wait a second.
No, no.
Hold it!
Wait a minute!
Hold it!
- All right.
Hold it.
- Look, General if you take my advice, you can live to be an old Korshak.
But you don't need me hanging around counting your calories and putting out your cigar and listening to your liver hiccup.
There are a lot of boys who come through this place whose lives I can save if I'm here.
You guys always say the men come first.
Well, do they or don't they?
They do.
All right, Pierce.
You stay here and do your job.
I'll do mine.
I can take orders too.
Good.
I'll have a corned beef on rye with mustard.
You're right.
The kid is a pistol.
Let's go.
Come on.
Don't forget the ribbons for the wall!
Is it true, Colonel?
General Korshak is still in the market for a personal physician?
- That's right, Burns.
- I'm perfect for the job.
- I'd like your recommendation.
- You've got it.
- And mine.
- And mine.
- The motion's carried.
-  I'd appreciate it, sir, if you'd send a letter to the general outlining my qualifications.
- Good idea.
-  - What are they?
- I have a thriving practice back in Fort Wayne.
They're thriving 'cause Frank's not there.
- And a splendid war record.
- Should you mention the time - he dropped his bubble gum in the patient?
- Bubble gum.
Good.
Or the time he sneezed and performed an accidental appendectomy.
- Fainted in O.R. 27 times.
- Threw up in post-op 12.
- Overslept 48.
- Colonel, you're not writing all that down?
I'm getting it all.
It may help.
- The hysterectomy on that sergeant.
- Boy, was he sore about that.
- Colonel!
I - Oh, let's not forget Major Houlihan.
Oh, Major Houlihan.
We shouldn't forget

# Nobody knows the trouble I've seen # I know.
# Somebody knows the trouble I've seen # This thing has knocked out more guys than Joe Louis.
The winner and still champion  Captain, may I be excused from this detail?
- My nylons are baggin' all around the knees.
- Get bigger knees.
Corporal, you're gonna have to do better than this.
I want this floor clean enough to eat off.
- Easy.
It's already cleaner than the tables in the Mess.
- Keep scrubbing!
- Ah, what a festive mood people get in at a G.I. Party.
- Oh, shut up.
Major Houlihan, I hope you and your nurses are doing a good job.
- We can hold up our end.
Why don't you go and hold up yours?
-  Very well.
When you finish checking that machine, check it again.
- Frank, how long are you gonna be here?
- Ten minutes.
Wake me when he's gone.
- Those aren't even connected.
- Told you this was a "tankless"job.
You crazy guy!
Frank, go make yourself useful.
- I'm a supervisor.
I don't have to be useful.
- Well, you're doing a great job.
Oh, go stuff a goose.
- Put a little elbow grease into that, Corporal!
- I'm all out of elbow grease.
- Don't talk back to me!
- Yes, sir!
- You did that on purpose, you Lebanese lout!
- Hold it.
What's goin' on here?
I saw the whole thing.
Frank tried to eat Klinger's mop.
- Burns, I put you in charge of this detail.
- Doin' a great job, Colonel.
- He's already washed his face and his shirt.
- At the same time.
- Why is it taking so long?
- Nobody's following orders, and they're all grumpy.
- Not true.
I'm Grumpy.
- He's Sneezy.
- He's Bashful.
- She's Dopey.
- Wash your mouth.
Okay.
Just get it done.
Let's all try to get along.
- # Get along, little doggie # - I had a long little doggie once.
- It was a dachshund.
- Oh, a little hot dog.
What happened to him?
- He got mustered out.
- I relish these conversations.
- Will you knock off the silliness?
- Knock yourself off, goofball.
I was invited to the Goof Ball, but I didn't have a thing to wear.
- Colonel, they're making me sick.
-  Me too.
- Please.
I just mopped the floor!
- And look at it!
It's filthy!
That's right.
Criticize my work.
I mop my heart out, and that's all the thanks I get?
- Don't talk back to me!
I'm an officer!
- But you're no gentleman.
- Oh, can it, nurses!
Check the surgical packs.
-  Checking, checking.
-  Checking packs like crazy.
-  Put a lid on it!
- It's been this way all day, sir.
No discipline.
- Okay, okay.
- Let's all try to work together, make the best of it.
-  Okay.
Here we go.
-  I'm getting out of here.
- You heard the colonel.
Have fun!
Yeah.
- Oh.
- Ooh.
Hiya, Father!
- Any luck, Father?
- We have a winner here.
I found the mail.
-  Bingo.
You're a genius.
- Not really.
Mail's just in time.
Everybody's chewing each other up.
Oh, heavens!
I have another surprise.
- Don't tell me.
You got Mildred in one of your bags.
- No, Colonel.
It's that movie you requested, your favorite Western.
Hot damn!
Things are lookin' up.
Never mind what I told you before!
Forget the instrument packs and clean these shelves.
- They're filthy.
There's dirt all over them.
- All right.
- Come on, now.
Step on it!
- Frank, if you say "step on it" one more time, I'll step on you.
- Well, then, move it, then!
Move it!
- Shut up, Frank!
Nurses, will you pipe down?
I can't hear myself yell.
Mind your own business, Captain.
I'll handle this.
You're messing up my floor!
Will you quit walking on my clean floor?
Attention, all personnel.
Colonel Potter would like to address the personnel personally.
- There you go, sir.
Just keep your finger on that button.
- Thank you, Corporal.
This is good news.
I know you've been working your butts off excuse me and you're all as itchy as a dog at a flea circus.
First of all, there's mail.
-  - Yea!
What's mail?
That oughta cheer you up.
And after supper in the Mess Tent, I've got a treat for everybody something you're all gonna love to see.
- Gypsy Rose Lee!
- Doing a fan dance.
It's my kind of entertainment, my all-time favorite movie.
I'm saving the title till show time, after chow in the Mess Tent.
So bye-bye and buy bonds.
- I shouldn't have said that.
-  Take your finger off the button.
-  What?
-  They can hear what you're saying.
Maybe I'd better handle this.
Colonel Potter is now finished with his message to the 4077.
- See, sir, if you don't take your finger off - I know.
I just forgot.
- Hey, Beej, you got a pen?
- Why?
Somebody mail you a pig?
- I need something to write with.
- Here.
Try this.
But I think it's out of ink.
- Very cute.
Hey, Frank, lend me your pen.
- No, thank you, pal.
- What do you mean, no?
- N-O, no.
- Why not?
- You'll ruin it.
The point's used to the way I write.
- It's used to stupid?
- Oh, stuff it in your Valpak.
- Hey, Hawk, guess what Peg sent me.
- A pony?
No.
A Dutch apple crumb pie.
It's delicious.
Try some.
- Mmm-mmm.
This is really crummy.
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, it's awful.
- What?
You gotta be kidding.
Would a dying man kid?
Geez.
Frank, let me have some of that shoe polish.
-  What for?
- I want to get this rotten taste out of my mouth.
- You have no taste.
- I did before I had that pie.
- All right.
I'll eat it all myself.
- I'll be one of your pallbearers.
Just don't bury me in that shirt you brought me from Seoul.
You're knocking my gift?
I picked that shirt out myself.
- No wonder it's irregular.
- What do you mean?
I mean one sleeve is longer than the other.
- No, no, no, no, no.
That's not true.
-  - Wear it yourself.
- I will.
I'm gonna put on this lovely shirt and go visit the nurses in it.
- There.
-  Perfect.
Nothing wrong with this shirt.
Creep.
-  Who is it?
- Quasimodo.
-  What do you want?
- I'm here to ring your bells.
- Come in.
- Ladies.
-  Hi.
- On behalf of the officers and gentlemen of the 4077 th and myself, I invite you to dinner and a movie in what is accurately called the Mess Tent.
- Please R.S.V.P.
In this ear.
- No.
- This ear does not accept no for an answer.
- Well, I'm sorry.
- That's the only answer this mouth has.
- Where are you going?
We've been invited to dinner at "l" Corps.
Wine, tablecloths, silverware.
- Pilots.
- What does a pilot have that I haven't got?
- A plane.
- Why settle for a plane when you can have a fancy?
We're tired of this place, and we're tired of the same people.
We wanna see somebody fresh.
- I've always been fresh with you.
- Not tonight.
- What if I got on my hands and knees?
- No.
- What if I got on your hands and knees?
- Not a chance.
Well, I'm not gonna ask again.
A man has to have some dignity.
-  - Yes?
- It's me.
Frank.
- Oh, what do you want?
I'm busy.
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Oh, all right.
- Well, I was wondering - Frank, you can come in.
- I can?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Oh, will you get in here?
Place looks just the same.
You know, you look lovely in this light.
The war's been very kind to you, Margaret.
- Is that it?
- No!
I want you to sit with me at the movie tonight.
Just as a friend.
- Just as a friend, I accept.
- You see?
Even though you're engaged, we can still be civil to each other.
- You're right.
- And after the movie, I can walk you back here.
- That'd be nice.
- If it isn't too late, we can play war games like we used to.
- Frank.
- It was such fun, Margaret!
You'd hide under the covers and pretend it was a tent, and I'd be a bomb and drop on you.
Frank, you bombed out!
You lost!
And Donald Penobscott won.
Penobscott.
What a stupid name.
And you're gonna be Margaret Penobscott.
"I'd like you to meet the Penobscotts.
"Donald Penobscott.
Margaret Penobscott.
And all the little Penobscotts Huey, Dewey and Louie Penobscott".
- Frank?
- Huh?
I'm gonna count to three, and if you're still here, I'm gonna snap off your epaulets.
- Put it away.
You know how I hate that.
- One.
- You're bluffing.
- Three!
You skipped two!
The tension is so thick in here, you could cut it with a knife.
- Not with this one.
- It's so quiet.
Nobody's talking.
Perhaps the entertainment tonight will improve everyone's disposition.
- What is the movie tonight, Father?
- That's privileged information.
I don't want to spoil Colonel Potter's surprise.
It'd better be good.
This crowd is ready to beat up Shirley Temple.
Hold it, soldier.
Let me check that tray.
- You didn't finish your peas!
- They're hard as a rock, sir.
- They hurt my tooth.
- You're wasting food!
Just look at that tray!
- I can't, sir.
It makes me woozy.
- You didn't finish your meat.
The meat's all fat.
It Oh, no.
That's the potatoes.
Don't you realize there are people starving in Poland?
- Here.
You can send 'em this.
- What's the problem now, Burns?
- Well, sir, I'm the garbage officer.
- We all know that.
And there's been a tremendous waste of food, especially rutabaga, lima beans and liver.
- Is that a surprise to you?
- What if the enemy got ahold of this?
We'd win the war.
Tell you what, Burns.
If there's any food left you think is edible, you eat it.
Here you go, sir.
May I have your attention, please.
I know you've been working hard all week, and you've got a case of the cranks.
I'm confident tonight's entertainment will make new men out of ya except for you women.
This movie's a classic.
It's got the three things that make a movie great horses, cowboys and horses.
You might've guessed it's a Western.
It's called now, hold onto your hats My Darling Clementine.
- Oh!
- See?
You feel better already.
Gee whiz.
That's terrific.
I haven't seen a good movie in ages.
Oh, Frank, don't be childish.
It's only a movie.
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
A movie!
I'm so excited I could plotz!
- # Oh, my darlin'# -  - # Oh, my darlin' # -  # Oh, my darlin' Clementine # #You are lost and gone forever # - # Dreadful sorry, Clementine # -  - # In a cavern, in a canyon # -  -  Look at all that space!
-  Yeah.
-  There's Ward Bond.
-  That's Margaret's whip!
-  Who's that?
-  Alan Mowbray.
-  No.
- Hey, there's Alan Mowbray!
-  And who's that ridin'him?
-  There you go.
-  Hey!
Henry Fonda!
-   It's Walter Brennan.
-  Oh, yeah.
- My name's Clanton.
This is my boy, Ike, my oldest boy.
Hey, is Sweetwater up beyond?
Yeah, two, three miles straight up the trail.
- I'm ruinin' my nails!
-  - This film is full of splices.
It's not my fault.
-  - This film is full of splices.
It's not my fault.
-  Hold on, now.
Don't leave.
You're gonna miss a swell movie.
Tell you what.
We'll fill in the time.
Let's all sing a community sing.
-  - We'll have the film fixed in a jiffy.
-  - We'll have the film fixed in a jiffy.
- Come on.
It's fun!
It's also an order.
-  -  Well, in that case - How 'bout the "Tennessee Waltz"?
- Okay.
- Okay?
- # I was waltzing # -  Lower, lower, lower.
- Too high?
-  # I was waltzing # #With my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz # #When an old friend I happened to see # # Introduced him to my true love # #And while they were dancing # # My friend stole my sweetheart from me # #I remember the night ## Father Mulcahy, you should've taken up the harmonica.
Yes, you're right.
Colonel Potter's tryin' to keep the party going till the film's fixed.
- Have fun.
- Sounds like they're having it.
- I got it.
Here we go!
Lights!
-  Good evenin', Mr. Clanton.
Good evenin'.
Fellow with a trail herd, remember?
Oh, sure.
I remember you.
You was right.
I didn't get very far with 'em.
They was rustled this evenin'.
That so?
Well, that's too bad.
Guess you'll be heading for California, huh?
Oh, I figured on sticking around a while.
Got myself a job.
- Cowpunchin'?
- Marshaling.
Marshaling?
In Tombstone?
Well, good luck to you, Mr Earp.
Wyatt Earp.
-  Klinger, you moron!
-  I blew the bulb.
It's not my fault.
Who do I look like, Thomas Edison?
- No.
You look like Mrs. Edison.
-  - Got a good bulb here someplace.
-  Well, find it!
- Got an idea.
Not a bad earring.
-  - Got an idea.
Not a bad earring.
-  Hit it, Father.

My word, Hawkeye.
This jocularity is most unseemly.
-  - You try.
- Me?
- Ooh, how can you make jokes at a time like this?
Ooh.
-  The post-op is collapsing, and the O.R.'s on fire.
And somebody has broken into the sacramental wine.
Oh, I'm sorry, Father.
It seems that Private Simpson has come down with a case of hepatitis.
It is the most remarkable shade of yellow.
Jocularity!
Jocularity!
Let me just say this about all these impersonations.
Now that is definitely the Mills Brothers.
Hold it.

Probe.
Remember, if you hit oil, we go halvsies.
-  Just my luck.
I struck bullet.
- Well, get the lead out.
- I'll take that, Captain.
- Huh?
This guy wanted it for a souvenir.
I'm trying to save his life, and he's saving shrapnel?
Why do these guys want to pick up every hunk of junk they trip over?
Collecting junk is America's favorite pastime.
Well, what's wrong with that?
It's fun and it's profitable.
My last patient had six dollars' worth of North Korean metal in his butt.
- Great place to hide it.
- You know that Korean kid Pierce is working on?
He was collecting brass in the minefields.
Probably making more money than I am.
Too bad there's such a good market for it.
Oh, that's right.
Knock free enterprise.
Why do these people want to take home mementos from this lousy war?
So they remember what they're trying to forget.
I've got souvenirs from every place I've been.
- Have you tried flea powder?
- My nephew's a sucker for souvenirs.
He takes trips so he can cover his car windows with decals.
Now the nitwit can't see where he's going 'cause his windows are all covered with where he's been.
Frank.
Margaret, how nice of you to join me.
Is there anything I can do for you?
- Yes.
Stop salivating and listen.
- It's oatmeal.
- I want my ring back.
- What ring?
What ring?
The ruby ring I gave you on our first anniversary.
You've been out in the sun too long.
You never gave me a ring, ruby or any other kind.
- Frank!
- You never did!
Although if you had, you certainly have your nerve crawling back for it now.
I'm not crawling, Frank.
That happens to be a precious family heirloom and now that you and I are no longer close I wish to give it to Donald.
- Indian giver.
- Then you admit you have it.
I do not.
I'm just pointing out that, uh had you given it to me as you seem to think you did, and you didn't you'd be an Indian giver.
You once compared the ruby to my lips.
That sounds like me, okay.
Must have been somebody else.
- There is nobody else like you, Frank.
- Margaret, l Watch it!
My heart belongs to another.
Let him have your heart.
I'll take what's left.
I love you.
Frank, if you ever cared for me, you'll return the ring.
I don't have it, Margaret.
I only wish I did.
We military men like keeping little mementos of our battlefield conquests.
Then hold on to this.
Here's a pair of earrings, Klinger.
I had 'em designed just for you.
Huh?
They're made out of.
45-caliber shells.
Anything over .
30 caliber is gauche.
Taste.
You have taste.
Gotta tell you.
All right.
Here's something I know you're gonna like.
Not many men can wear this.
You ready?
The safety pins from a hundred hand grenades.
Don't you have anything happy?
Whatever happened to rhinestones?
- Klinger, this is a war.
Nobody throws rhinestones.
-  Mr. Stratton.
Hey, Chang.
- Got some good junk.
You're gonna like it.
- Let's see.
Ah, that's junko.
No, there's nothing I, uh - There's nothing I need.
- First-class junk.
Look at brass.
No, no.
You see, it's it's a miss, kid.
It's no good.
All right.
I'll give you a buck for it.
Here.
- Five bucks.
Please?
- No.
Two.
Now beat it.
He beats me every time.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Okay, what about the earrings?
Nah, I gotta give my lobes a rest.
All right.
Now this is you.
This is you.
An aluminum watchband.
The material came off a MiG.
Some other war.
Ah, boy.
Hey, Hawkeye, how'd you like an aluminum bracelet for your wrist?
How'd you like a knuckle sandwich for your mouth?
- Oh, come on, guys.
A guy's gotta live.
- Shall we put it to a vote?
- Hey, what's eating you guys?
- What's eating us is you.
Because you insist on dealing in that stuff I wound up working on one of your eight-year-old garbage collectors.
I don't force those kids to bring me this junk.
They're go-getters.
They do it on their own.
- What choice do they have?
- They could go into law school or advertising.
- Even better, they could starve to death.
- Aw, come off it.
All I do is peddle a few harmless souvenirs.
I mean, what I do is good for the economy.
I create jobs!
For the undertaker.
Boy, you guys really think you're hot stuff because you're M.D.s and I'm just a chopper pilot.
- Make that Pontius Pilate.
- Put it to music, Pierce.
Hey, soldier!
Hold up!
Have I got a deal for you.
Souvenir hunting has been a problem in every war.
Hannibal's men booby-trapped their elephants' trunks.
They blew up every time they went swimming.
- Isn't there anything that can be done about this?
- Like what?
I don't know.
Like if you catch anybody selling this stuff, you park a tank on his chest.
I hope we can come up with something a little less severe.
How 'bout a jeep?
You see?
I'm guilty of buying some of these trinkets myself.
- We all have to stop sometime.
- So what do you want me to do?
- Do what you do best.
Scream at the troops.
- Holler on 'em.
That's easy.
- If that doesn't work - Park a tank on 'em.
Or a jeep.
We are in the midst of an epidemic.
It's not the plague, not the chicken pox, not the creeping crud.
It's the buying, selling and collecting of war souvenirs.
And it's getting people killed.
The enemy leave their booby-trapped pistols, bayonets and helmets all over the place 'cause they know some slaphappy G.I. Will try to pick up that cockarocka and before he knows it his nickname is "Lefty".
On top of that, Korean kids scavenge in the minefields for brass to make ashtrays for us to stick our butts in.
So stop making a market for a bunch of trash you don't need anyway.
If you want a souvenir, take yourself home in one piece.
Remember, somebody at home loves you.
Don't ask me why.
Any questions?
Yo!
Does this mean you're prohibiting the buying and selling of souvenirs?
I don't have that authority.
This is just friendly advice from the C.O. To the people who serve under him, if you get my drift.
Any other questions?
Dismissed.
- Good try, Colonel.
- Yeah, you convinced me.
Oh, that's the trouble with speeches.
You wind up convincing your friends and boring your enemies.
-  Colonel?
- What?
- Oh, Colonel!
- Where'd that come from?
Up here, sir.
Heard your speech, Colonel, and I loved it.
Thank you.
Now what are you doing sitting on top of that pole?
I'm pole-sitting, sir.
It's Section Eight time.
Klinger, you're the tops.
"What light through yonder window breaks"?
It is the east, and Klinger is the nuts.
Come down, Klinger, before you hurt yourself.
No, sir.
I came up a soldier.
I'll come down a civilian.
One gust of wind, you'll come down a pancake.
- I love 'em with maple syrup.
- Klinger, don't be a sap.
I'm not a sap.
I'm crazy.
Who in his right mind would climb a platform over a basketball hoop in the middle of the night?
- Shimmy down, Klinger.
- This is where I make my stand.
- He's making it sitting down.
- I thought you were afraid of high places, Klinger.
I'm desperate.
Send me back to Toledo.
He wants to go back to Toledo?
That is desperate.
- You keep saying crazy stuff like that, you're halfway home.
- Does anybody want my opinion?
- No.
- I don't think so.
I'd chop the pole down.
- That would open up the game to little guys.
- Ah, what a trio of schmoes.
Make that a duo.
- Adios.
- Just don't walk away.
Can't you see I'm crazy?
Klinger, if I got rid of all the crazies in this camp I'd be the loneliest man in Korea.
I'm not coming down, sir.
In that case, I have just one piece of advice for you.
When you're walking guard duty tonight take very tiny steps.
- Hmm.
- Hmm?
My daughter is saying complete sentences.
How old is she?
- Two.
- See, Frank?
Don't give up.
- Someday you'll be saying complete sentences.
- Oh, hardy-har-har.
Keep trying, Frank.
Nobody said it was gonna be easy.
-  - Entrez.
Pardon me, sirs.
I'm looking for Major Frank Burns.
Oh, I'm Major Burns.
What is it?
- Do you know a Corporal Thomas Hinton?
- No.
I don't think so.
Why?
He was dealing in Korean antiques on the black market.
When we caught up with him last week, he gave us a rundown of his customers.
Your name was on that list.
He says you purchased a bowl from him.
And it turned out to be an 800-year-old celadon vase of the Koyou dynasty.
- It must have been somebody using my name.
- And your face.
- How could somebody use my face?
- How about for a doormat?
An 800-year-old vase.
Do you know how much it went for, Sergeant?
$27.75.
- What was it worth?
- It's priceless.
Really?
Boy, isn't that interesting.
The Koreans are anxious that their national art treasures remain in the country.
- Ah.
- The U.S. Army supports that position.
I'm sure if Major Burns suddenly remembers buying that vase - he'll be the first to deny it.
- Of course.
I hope you catch that ugly creep that's been using my face.
Yes, sir.
So do I. - Thank you, sir.
- Call again.
Wow, a priceless vase bought for $28.
What a shrewd buy that was.
##  Well, don't look at me.
##  Let me have another drink, please.
Oh Forget the fruit.
What's the matter, Margaret?
You trying to drown your sorrows?
- No.
Just taking them out for a little swim.
- What's the trouble?
I'm sore at a friend who's no friend.
Makes sense to me.
Do I look like an Indian giver?
- No, I don't think you'd give anything away.
- You're damn right.
Hey, Doctors.
You better grab it.
- Only got 200 left.
Pure brass.
- And so are you.
Well, if it isn't Jiminy Cricket.
The conscience that never takes a vacation.
Stratton, what are you still doing here?
Didn't Colonel Potter tell you to to shove off?
He didn't tell me to shove off.
He just bored me with a lot of bad advice.
You know something, Stratton and don't take it personally I think you stink.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
I'm just trying to conduct a little free, honest enterprise.
- Isn't that what we're fighting about?
- You know, Stratton you call yourself a businessman, but you got a very limited inventory.
- You could make a fortune if you'djust expand a little.
- What do you mean?
Well, all these ashtrays, pistols and bowls are fine.
But the real demand is for arms, legs and feet.
I got some customers for you right here in post-op.
You created a demand.
Why don't you just start supplying it?
Not funny, Pierce.
Real bad taste.
What are you wasting your time talking to this creep?
- If my fiance, Donald Penobscott - Lieutenant Colonel.
- Lieutenant Colonel Donald Penobscott - Of West Point.
That's him.
If he were here, which he isn't, you know what he'd do?
- Buy an ashtray?
- Negative.
He'd take this bum by the neck, and he'd deck him!
Ow!
It's a good thing Donald isn't here.
Yeah.
Stratton could get hurt.
Oh, Father Mulcahy - Yes?
-  Gesundheit.
Oh.
Oh, Klinger.
Oh, I'm glad it's you.
Who were you expecting, "Shipwreck" Kelly?
- What are you doing up there, Klinger?
- I'm catching cold.
Well, can't you do that down here?
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Colonel.
Did you know Klinger was up the basketball pole?
Yeah, he's a human foul shot.
You ready to land, Mr. Lindbergh?
Are you ready to send me back home to Toledo?
- No can do, Klinger.
- No can land, Colonel.
-  - Bless you.
- Thank you.
- He's catching a cold.
Sounds like it.
He's just being stubborn.
I'm not stubborn.
I'm crazy.
Give me a Section Eight.
You're not even half crazy, Klinger.
So make it a Section Four.
Send me as far as San Francisco.
From there I'll hitch.
I'll settle for a Section Two.
Send me to Honolulu.
From there I'll swim.
- Bless you.
- Gesundheit.
What are you gonna do with this slug, Cooper?
It's gonna be my good luck piece.
Funny kind of good luck piece.
It could've killed you.
Could have, but it didn't.
That's why it's lucky.
Okay.
- I'm going for some coffee.
- I'll bring the antidote.
- Are you his mother?
- Yes.
- How's he feel?
-   - He has pain.
- Yeah.
Tell him I know.
I'm sorry I can't make it all go away.
He's been hunting for brass shells for a long time?
For two years.
To help support our family.
And when he feels better, he's gonna go back into the minefields?
He will go back.
War is such a noble adventure.
Okay.
Okay, pal.
You're gonna be okay.
You weird freak!
"Dear Louise, Guard this object with your life.
"It's a priceless Korean antique.
Yours truly, your husband, Frank Burns".
- What a sexy note!
- Don Juan he ain't.
- All right.
You got it?
- Right here.
Give my regards to Fort Wayne.
- What do we do with this?
- Potter will see it gets back where it belongs.
Imagine, 800 years?
You know how old that is?
As I recall, it was the last time I had clean shorts.
- Can I have your elbow, please?
- Mm-hmm.
Got ya, you little thief!
Uncle!
Uncle!
I give up!
Margaret, you?
Guess what I found in your footlocker, Frank.
Oh, pussycat, I just wanted a little reminder of what we once meant to each other.
Go suck an egg!
- Couldn't we wrestle some more?
- What?
I didn't know it was you.
It was no fun at all.
Once again, but not so rough.
- Ow!
Ow!
- Let that be a little reminder of what we once meant to each other, creep!
Margaret.
Marg How about two out of three falls?
- Morning, Major.
- Good morning, sir.
- May I join you?
- Certainly.
- I'd like the two of us to have a little chat.
- Fine.
What's on your mind?
Well, I know temper is a difficult thing to harness particularly if you've been drinking and if your ethnic background - has a tradition of settling things physically.
- What are you getting at?
Well, Major Houlihan, you gotta stop getting bombed and beating up our officers.
- Who said that?
- Easy.
I'm sure they deserved it.
What I'm trying to say is, it's always better to talk things out than punch them out.
- Let me explain what happened.
- I don't wanna hear the details.
- I'm talking!
- Go right ahead.
In both cases, I was unjustifiably provoked.
I was responding to "unseemingly," unmilitary behavior and if it happened again, I'd do the same thing.
I see what you mean.
I'm glad we had this little talk.
So am I. Have a good day, Colonel.
Uh, good day, Major.
An egg's an amazing thing.
There's nothing as hard and yet as delicate.
Except my arteries.
The egg is so versatile.
You can do almost anything to it.
You can boil it.
You can fry it.
You can scramble it.
- You can put a hat on it.
- Put a lid on it.
I'm tryin' to read.
Some private from the 8063rd just set a new pole-sitting record.
On news like that, we can take the day off.
Ninety-four hours and 18 minutes.
What tomfoolery.
Leave it to Drake to promote that sort of nonsense.
- Who's Drake?
- C.O. Of the 8063rd.
I can see his fine hand in this.
Little bits of tawdry glory are all that matter to him.
I still remember the day he swallowed 23 goldfish to break the old record at Camp Grant.
To see him strutting around, you'd have thought he'd licked the kaiser single-handed.
- What was the old record?
- Twenty-two.
- I was sick as a dog for a week.
-  Klinger!
Colonel.
I give up.
You win.
I'm coming down!
Hold it!
How long's it been so far?
About two days.
In hours.
How long in hours?
About 48.
Great, Klinger.
You're more than halfway there.
How's that, sir?
You've got just 46 hours and 19 minutes to go to break the MASH pole-sitting record.
Forty-six hours and 19 minutes?
You mean you want me to stay up here, sir?
You can do it on one wing, Lindy.
But, Colonel, it's cold as a witch's elbow.
I'll give you your choice.
You can stay up there or come down here and swallow 24 goldfish.
Did you say The first 18 are easy.
Would you send up my flannel nightie and my genuine imitation fox stole?
- Is he gonna be okay?
- What are you doing here, Stratton?
Hey, white flag, okay?
I got something for the family.
It's a gift.
Fifty bucks.
- No, no.
Take it.
- Thank you.
Yeah, this little guy is one of my best suppliers.
I figure a guy in business shouldn't forget something like that.
Oh!
Hey, Chin, you hurry up and get out of here, and I'll take you up in my whirlybird.
You know  If I were you, I wouldn't fly with him.
You know?
Got something for you.
Here.
Oh, great.
Perfect gift for a child.
Well that's how good this is.
It looks like a real Chinese pistol, huh?
Clever!
Very.
Can you get me a cigarette lighter that fires bullets?
I got a brother-in-law in Chicago that can get as many of these as I need.
What does a kid need with a cigarette lighter?
Well, when he quits smoking, he can always sell it.
- Stratton, uh, come on outside.
- Yeah, we wanna talk to you.
- What about?
- Your future.
Hold it.
If you guys are gonna get rough - I can get you in a lot of trouble.
- Come on.
Let's go.
This gonna be a fair fight, or are you gonna do two against one?
We're not gonna hit you.
We want you to disappear.
- I got a right to be here.
- You got nerve.
You think because you slipped the family a couple bucks, that gets you off the hook?
Oh, you people just don't appreciate me.
The other guy that had this route was heartless.
One of his kids got hurt, he'd just send flowers.
I'm glad to hear the business was taken over by a humanitarian.
Why don't you face facts?
There's nothing you say can change me, and nothing you do can stop me.
- Stratton, you're a sick man.
-  That's one man's opinion.
Make that two.
I'm worried about this man, Doctor.
He looks anemic.
- Look at the color of his skin.
- Pallid.
-  Very white.
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- Low blood count.
- He could pass out up there.
- Hey, cut it out.
- This is serious.
- I can't let this man fly.
- I agree.
Not fly?
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait.
Hold it.
You can't do that.
- Actually, we can.
- We'll have to give him a blood test.
- I have a feeling he'll flunk.
- I think you're right.
Hey, hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it!
I got an announcement to make.
I just went out of the business.
I think he's getting better.
- Okay, but I keep flying, right?
- Right.
Oh, boy, you guys are crazy.
You're really kidding yourselves.
Fine, you got me.
Great.
But there's a thousand other guys hustling out there.
What are you gonna do, change the world?
- No, just our little corner of it.
- So long, Stratton.
Take a walk.
You know I sold a thousand of these?
It's my last pair.
At least I got a souvenir.
Klinger, wake up!
You broke the record!
-  Huh?
- You did it!
Yeah?
I got the record?
And a three-day pass in Tokyo whenever you're ready to shove off.
I'm ready.
I got the record.
I got the record.
I got the record.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Don't thank me.
You've earned the pass.
I meant for making me stay up there.
- I set a record.
- That's right!
Yeah, but someday some kid will come along and break it.
In an imitation fox stole and army shoes?
Not a chance.
- Hey, that's right!
I set a record.
-  -  - Who is it?
-  It's me!
- Margaret?
Come in.
What did I do?
I mean, what can I do for you?
You owe me $15.
- What for?
- For this.
Oh, you got your ring back.
Now stop picking on me!
- Here, look.
- It's beautiful.
Look inside.
Read the inscription.
I can't make it out.
I don't have my glasses.
You don't wear glasses, Frank.
- Maybe I can borrow some?
- I'll read it to you.
- "To Louise.
Love, Frank B." - I can explain that.
So can I. You were gonna give my ring to your wife?
It only looks that way.
The engraver made a mistake.
It's a typo.
I want it removed.
You can give me $ 15 or 15 teeth.
Will you take a check?
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
We need blood, damn it.
Lots of it and then some.
I had to get rid of every drop we had in stock.
You heard right, Captain.
Couple of boys we treated turned up later with hepatitis.
And you don't catch that sitting in a draft.
If you can't do anything, put me on to someone who can someone with a little authority, Captain!
Who's this?
Sergeant Frankle?
Peachy.
Sergeant, I've told everyone else.
I'll tell you.
The 4077 th is out of blood.
We're squeezing turnips here.
All my personnel have donated at least twice.
Dracula couldn't find a quick snack around these parts.
You're either gonna have to get us some blood or call off the war.
- We're doling it out by the corpuscle now.
- Hold on, Pierce.
- I'll wait, Sgt.
- I just gave that Turkish captain another ten units bringing his grand total up to 30.
- That's a complete oil change in 24 hours.
- I'm trying to order some.
- Tie up your horses.
- I am.
We might need 'em as donors.
Yes, Sergeant.
What?
Which flunky am I talking to now?
Oh, excuse me, Colonel, but I've been getting the royal runaround.
I appreciate you boys are low down there, but this is an emergency.
I'm not asking.
I'm begging.
And I'm threatening!
If there aren't the boys and I are gonna come down there and alter the pants on all your dress uniforms.
You gotta reason with these guys.
Hello?
- Good job, Pierce.
He hung up.
- Did he leave his inseam?
- Good job, Pierce.
He hung up.
- Did he leave his inseam?
Attention, all personnel.
Incoming wounded.
- Triage team report to the evac bus.
- That's not what I ordered.
I.V. For him.
He's in shock.
Get him right into pre-op.
- Just once I'd like to see a few empty seats.
- Or an empty bus.
- Take it easy, fella!
Come on.
Take it easy.
- Let me help you there, Doc.
- I could use a wrestler, but you'll do fine.
- Nessen, take it easy.
It's me, Moody.
Doc here is gonna help you, okay?
- Where'd you come down from?
- Munsan.
About 20 miles north.
- It was a town until last night.
- I'd hate to be the guy who makes the maps here.
You know it.
Haven't you been a guest in this hotel before?
Six months ago.
Yeah, I remember.
You offered to stuff me in my duffel bag.
Jerris Moody.
How you been, Captain Pierce?
Okay.
Litter!
Start a whole blood I.V. - This one can wait.
- Great.
- Give me a hand with this one.
- I thought you'd be proudly serving in the stockade by now.
First impressions can fool you.
Mine was you hated everybody and everything.
Yeah, I guess I did, but lately I haven't had time to do anything except keep myself and my buddies alive.
- You're a different guy, huh?
- Yeah, I'm a regular Florence Nightingale.
For Pete's sake, why are you just standing around?
Can't we get moving here?
Sure, Nurse.
Would you help us move this guy into pre-op?
- Nurse!
You're talking to a major.
- Oh, sorry.
- Would you help us move this guy into pre-op, Major?
- Litter!
This kid's back is covered with shrapnel.
I feel like a prospector.
- Pierce, do you always have to talk while you work?
- You're right, Frank.
Nurse, from now on I'll blink my left eye for a clamp, my right eye for a sponge and when I wiggle my ears, that means meet me under a jeep in half an hour.
Yuck, yuck, yuckety, yuck.
- Quiet, Frank.
We're working.
- Quiet, all of you!
I've got a bullet near the heart.
I don't need all this hubbub.
Shh!
Get him to post-op.
penicillin every six hours.
That's the easy part.
Now I gotta tell him I removed his leg.
Start it off with, "Son, you're alive".
Well, break's over.
Orderly!
Give me some more light there.
Tilt it up.
Clamp.
That's enough!
That's enough!
Gloves.
Nurse, there are pits in my orange juice!
- Can we get a surgeon to remove those pits?
- I'll do it.
Nurse, strainer!
I've had it with you crumbs.
Eighteen hours of slaving over these wrecks.
I got better things to do with my time.
- Shut up, Burns!
Clamp.
- What's the matter, Pierce?
Cracking up, huh?
Sponge.
I mean, clamp!
Frank, as soon as I patch up this kid's arm, I'm gonna break one of yours.
- I got dibs on the other one.
- I'll pound all your bones into mulch.
I'll pound your mulch into brains.
All right, we've let off enough steam.
Let's holster our mouths.
Nurse, pull down my mask.
- Frank?
- Hmm?
Thank you.
Colonel, only ten units of whole blood left.
Thank God we're almost done.
You want me to call Seoul again?
No, I'll take another shot at that idiot colonel.
It'll be the capper of a perfect day.
Hypo.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to our show.
We have a two-bullet minimum and no flashbulbs, please.
- Colonel, any word from Seoul yet?
- Yeah.
The word is "wait".
You'd think those monkeys could spare a little blood.
Speaking of monkeys not giving blood, you haven't donated a drop, Frank.
Strategy.
One of us should always have a full tank.
- Why didn't I think of that?
- 'Cause you're not an idiot.
It was the weirdest thing.
I was sitting in this foxhole.
It seemed like nothing was happening, so I was reading one of those Communist leaflets, the ones that say we're all fighting for Wall Street.
Personally, I refuse to read them.
And suddenly, I look and here's this Chinese G.I. standing over me.
How could you let him sneak up on you like that?
He was my age, no older.
We just stared at each other.
I guess he was surprised as I was.
Probably the first time he'd seen an American close up.
- And then he shot you.
- No.
He got this scared look.
For a second, I thought he was gonna run away.
- And then what happened?
- We both fired.
I got hit in the shoulder, and it knocked me flat on my back.
What happened to him?
- The medic said I got him.
- Good for you.
I guess so.
Anything else I can get for you?
I'd like to drop a line to Mom, tell her I'm okay.
Of course.
- Dear Mother - No.
- It's Mom.
She hates when you call her Mother.
-  Dear Mom.
- Hey, have you got a mirror?
- Settle for a compact?
- A what?
- Just don't ask, "Who's the fairest of them all"?
Oh, damn!
Why they have to do that?
- I've had a moustache all my life!
- You were born with a moustache?
Well, since I was 12.
They had to shave it to stitch up your face.
They should have left it alone, man.
What's the big deal?
So you don't look like Gilbert Roland for a while.
Oh, you don't understand, man.
No moustache, I might as well be wearing a dress.
- Watch it, bub.
- All the real men in Puerto Rico have a moustache.
I think you look okay.
You got nice bushy eyebrows.
Oh, leave me alone, man.
And take your mirror with you.
I got nothing to look at.
Nice chatting with you.
We'll be able to ship you back to Tokyo.
You'll be more comfortable there.
Thanks.
That'll be terrific.
- You're gonna be all right.
- I thought I had it made.
Stay in the rear, clear out land mines.
"It's great, Herb.
No one shoots at ya.
"Just take your time.
"Snip the wires.
You got no problems".
No problems.
- What happened?
-  We lay our mines out in a pattern so we know how to pick 'em up.
But we booby-trap a few, so the enemy won't sneak in and snip the wires.
I forgot about that.
Next thing I know I'm lying across the road.
My leg's kind of numb.
I say to myself, "Herb you got a problem".
Colonel Potter!
Colonel!
Why the ruckus, Major?
- Sir, this man's unconscious.
- I can see that.
- Well, he shouldn't be.
He's He's my patient.
- That's a good enough reason.
- He's not wounded.
I can't find anything wrong with him.
- What are his signs?
- He's shocky, rapid pulse, low pressure, diminished breathing.
- Strange.
- It's not my fault.
I did my job.
- Nurse!
You're right.
The nurse is probably to blame.
- I'm not blaming anybody.
- I'm as conscientious as they come.
Put a cork on it, Burns.
Able, has this patient been unconscious since arrival?
Yes, Doctor.
- Beats the wampum out of me.
- I think he's sick.
I never could sleep on my stomach.
Me neither.
I could sleep on anyone else's but mine.
- How bad is it?
- Well, I wouldn't go horseback riding for a while.
- This is very embarrassing.
- Why?
'Cause when I go home, people are gonna be asking me where I got shot.
What am I gonna tell 'em?
Just say, uh, "I got shot in Korea".
What if they ask me where I got hit?
Look them right in the eye and say without blinking, "I got hit in the butt".
And if they keep bugging you, drop your pants and show them your scar.
Don't make me laugh.
Whitney, we're talking about your body.
It's been invaded by a bullet.
- There's nothing amusing about that.
- Don't I know it.
On the other hand, you should be proud.
You have a very special wound.
It's symbolic of this entire war.
This whole thing has been one gigantic pain in the butt.
And when they hand you your Purple Heart, you can tell them exactly where to pin it.
Thanks, Doc.
You're welcome.
Why am I always handed the trouble patients?
- Kellye.
I wanna see his latest X rays.
- Yes, Colonel.
- We have an emergency.
- Ask someone else!
He's handling my patient first.
The Turkish captain needs a transfusion.
His blood refuses to clot.
- Let me see him.
- That's all right.
You can go.
- Thank you.
- We don't have the blood to do the job.
Tell me something I don't know.
He needs a refill, quick.
- Even if we get donors, it'll be too late.
- Get him to pre-op.
- We'll remove his spleen.
That may start some clotting.
- Right away.
- Hawkeye, get on the horn to that colonel in Seoul.
- What'll I tell him?
Tell him I need 100 pints of blood, and I'm gonna come down there and take it all from him.
Come on.
What happened?
Confide in your trainer.
I went into Rosie's Bar last night.
There were some rear echelon guys in there who wanted to know if I could tap dance.
Ah.
Dale Carnegie graduates.
Yeah.
Well, I showed 'em a few steps, all right.
I did a buck-and-wing on their chests.
I've always loved "the dance".
Boy, those guys really surprised me with their garbage.
I went off like a firecracker.
I can understand that.
Boy.
When I was up in the front, my boys needed me.
They always used to scream for old Moody to come and get 'em.
I had the guts to go up there and drag 'em back to the aid station.
And you come back here, and a couple of jerks call you names.
When I was a kid, I was fighting all the time when somebody put me down 'cause I believed 'em.
Those guys surprised me last night.
But they're not gonna get me next time 'cause I got something that guys like that will never have self-respect.
There's not one valid reason I can think of why that soldier should be unconscious.
I gave him the once-over twice.
- If you couldn't find it - If I couldn't find it, it means my brains are clogged.
They discovered that boy in a sleeping bag, dead to the world or almost anyway.
Doesn't make any sense at all.
- Unless he had company in there.
- Colonel, please.
I don't mean human company.
Four-oh silk.
I mean, maybe a snake.
Those little poison ropes are all over these hills.
- A good dose of venom would turn anybody's lights dim.
- For heaven's sake.
- Kellye.
- Yes, Colonel?
Did any of those boys come off the meat wagon in their bare feet?
- A couple of them did, sir.
- Tell Pierce to check that patient for snake bite.
Especially the feet and ankles.
If he finds a bite, give him some antivenin, pronto.
- Brilliant, Colonel.
- If I'm so damn brilliant how is it I just put a stitch in my glove?
So what if I recover?
They'll send me right out there to do it again.
Those are the breaks, fella.
Lucky for me, I'm going home soon.
Back to Indiana, the good life.
- Lord knows I deserve it.
- Major, I don't wanna hear about home.
I've been out here almost since the beginning.
- I haven't seen my wife in all that time.
- That's tough.
She's changed too.
I'm only getting cookies a couple of times a month.
That's why I'm positive she's been fooling around.
Sort of a floozy, huh?
Watch it, pal.
You're talking about the woman I love.
I hired a private dick to follow her.
Trailed her everywhere P.T.A. Meetings, church functions.
And he came up with nothing.
Then I added it all up.
He was one of her caballeros too.
So I hired another cop to follow him.
And the second guy wanted expenses.
They get paid by the day, you know.
Major, I'm very tired.
Ha!
I'd have had enough money for ten detectives if my disease had come through.
- What's that, Major?
- I didn't tell you about my disease, did I?
No, you didn't.
But never mind.
It's okay.
A kid came through here with an unidentified rash.
I spotted it first.
I called it "Burn's Blight".
Catchiest name since diarrhea.
I was all set to make the lecture circuit and pick up my big fat research grant.
- And, uh - Well, what happened?
He got well, the ungrateful simp.
That's enough about me.
Now what about you, hmm?
Uh, you don't wanna hear about it, Major.
Of course I do.
We have orders to be compassionate.
I don't wanna fight anymore.
I've seen enough death, and I wanna go home.
Why don't you save that for the chaplain, chicken?
There's no law that says I have to sit here and listen to you bleeding hearts.
It's very common, son.
You ran across a snake with a foot fetish.
It's a good thing he wasn't a neck man, or you might have died from a terminal hickey.
What do you say after work we choose up sides for a football game?
- Nurses' shower's the end zone?
- Good.
I'm playing end.
Uh-uh.
Last time you went out for a pass, I didn't see you again till the fourth quarter.
Sergeant Raymond McGill, it's my duty to inform you that you're doing beautifully.
- Spare me the good news, Doc.
- What's the matter with you?
They're gonna send me stateside 'cause of this stupid wound.
That's the way it usually works.
I can't go home.
I have a family to support.
- You got a Korean family?
- No, no, in the States.
Once more, with clarity.
Doc, I'm making a fortune over here in Korea.
- You got the Band-Aid concession?
- I got some enterprises going.
Like selling booze, you know.
A fifth costs me a buck and a quarter in Tokyo.
Some friends fly it to me here, and I let it go for 12 bucks a crack.
- Fifty up at the line.
- Right neighborly of ya.
That's nothing.
I also have the only Polaroid camera in this whole sector.
All the guys want shots, so I put 'em on film for two bucks a piece.
Heaven help the economy when you go.
Maybe I don't have to go, Doc.
Put a few good marks on that chart, you'll be swimming in whiskey.
- I didn't bring my trunks.
- I'll let you borrow the camera.
You can take so many pictures of yourself, your wife will think you're back home.
- Sorry, McGill.
- Come on, Doc.
Please!
How am I gonna make any money in Jersey City?
They say America is the land of opportunity.
Sending me home, huh?
I heard you doctors had no hearts.
- Very chic, Klinger.
- I just threw it on.
Hey, Robelo.
Stay away from me, man.
I look at you, and I get nightmares.
- I solved your problem.
- What are you talking about?
An unofficial, government-issued, one each moustache.
That ain't funny.
Try it on.
I used my own hair.
Hundred percent Lebanese.
It'll probably keep growing.
- How does it look?
- It's you.
Hey!
Hey, that's not bad.
Vaya, man.
It's even thicker than my real one.
Gracias, huh?
Anytime.
Give me a couple of weeks and I can make you one with handlebars.
Hey, you're okay, man.
I know, but don't spread it around.
- Nurse?
- Hmm?
You have any idea how beautiful you are?
Have you any idea how many times I've heard that line?
- No, I'm not kidding.
On a scale of one to ten - I know.
- I'm a nine.
- Would you like to try for ten?
- Over your dead body?
- I'm in better shape than I look.
- Aren't we all?
- Listen.
- What time do you get off?
- What did you have in mind?
Well, I thought maybe when you get through with your shift, we can do something.
- Like go dancing?
- No, that's how I hurt my foot.
I thought maybe we can talk about all the great times we had together We haven't had any.
Well, we can talk about them tomorrow night.
What are you doin' for dinner?
I'm meeting one of my nurses.
The guy in the next cot's in a coma.
Maybe we can double-date.
- That sounds exciting.
- Listen.
You live alone?
I happen to have a fiance in Tokyo.
So what?
I happen to have a wife in Philadelphia.
Donald is a lieutenant colonel.
Sharon's a C.P.A. Don't you think we owe them a little consideration?
You're right.
We're overdoing it.
I happen to take my engagement very seriously.
Well, you should.
What do you think engagements are for?
It's a test period.
You're supposed to make comparisons.
- I've done enough comparing.
- You have?
Tell me about 'em.
The only conversation I'm having with you is medical.
Okay, fine.
Pull the screen around my bed and give me a complete physical.
- You guys are all alike.
- No, no, no.
I'm really in love with you.
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you starting tonight.
What do you say?
I say good-bye.
Nurse, do you happen to have any idea how beautiful you are?
Do you have any idea how many times I've heard that line?
Testing, testing.
Sorry.
Attention, everyone.
This is Colonel Potter.
I know it hasn't been 48 hours, but I'm gonna ask you for more blood.
We're as dry as a hump-less camel in the sunshine.
Anyone giving a pint will be excused from attending my hygiene lectures for the next month.
Please report to the Mess Tent.
And don't knock anybody down running to volunteer.
Toodle-oo.
That'll last us for about 12 hours.
-  Coming through.
Eager volunteer here.
- It's my blood!
It has rights!
- We're doing it a favor.
We're taking it away from you.
- It'll only hurt a lot.
- Next.
- No!
- When you sit in Santa's lap, don't spit in his beard.
- I won't go!
- They give balloons.
- Aha.
Major Burns at the front of the line.
- Good for you.
- Of course!
- These two bozos tried to butt in ahead of me.
- He's our leader.
- An inspiration to us all.
- Darn right.
-  What's this?
-  I think it's a truck.
I'm Sergeant Attias of the Turkish brigade.
- We understand the 4077 th MASH needs blood.
- In big red letters.
My men and I want to contribute for saving the life of our captain.
Your table is ready.
Our special tonight is tomato juice.
Thank you very much.
It's our pleasure.
It's a small thing to do for such brave people.
- You're not touching me, you vampire!
Leave me alone!
- This won't hurt at all.
- What's wrong with him?
- He's one of our brave people.
Right now he wants his mommy.
- Right this way.
- Uh, yes.
- Uh, after you.
- Oh, no, no, no.
After you.
- No, by your pleasure.
- No, no, no, you have the blood.
- Thank you very much.
-  Thank you very much.
How you feeling tonight, son?
A lot better than I was.
You're very lucky.
All you got was a concussion from that grenade.
Could have cracked your coconut.
Where's your home, son?
If I remember right, I'm from Chicago.
Boy, do I know that town.
I was a bachelor stationed at Camp Grant for two years.
- Used to hit Chicago like a tornado.
- I'm from the Near North Side.
Then you'll get a kick out of this.
The Dewdrop Inn.
It's a tavern at the southeast corner of Broadway and Lawrence.
- There's a bank there.
- A bank?
When did they put that up?
Around 1900, sir.
Well, I used to drink a lot in those days.
Used to hop off the "I" at Diversey and catch the White Sox at Comiskey Park.
Colonel, I think that's the Cubs at Wrigley Field.
Baseball's a wonderful game no matter who's playing.
Hmm, sure is.
My favorite tavern was The Shamrock at the corner of State and Dearborn.
- Sir?
- Yeah?
- State and Dearborn never meet.
- They don't?
No, sir.
They run parallel to each other.
- Listen.
Ever been to Detroit?
- No, Colonel.
Good.
We'll talk about Detroit tomorrow.
Meanwhile, rest.
Remember, you've had a concussion.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Eight months is a long time to be engaged, Major Houlihan.
-  Pickups without teeth.
- It's hardly your affair, Major Burns.
An affair is an affair is an affair.
-  Who wrote that, Hawk?
- Gertrude Stein to Alice B. Toklas on a piece of brown paper bag.
- I understand they were very close.
- Oh, yes.
They wrote together, traveled together and gave each other German haircuts.
That's two pieces of shrapnel.
Personally, I think your Colonel Penobscott's full of banana oil.
Not intending to pry, Major, but has your wedding date been set?
- Not yet, Father.
- No ring.
No wedding date.
I think it's, uh, "Thanks for the buggy ride".
- Burns, why don't you get off Major Houlihan's back?
-  More sponges.
I'm sure Major Houlihan's colonel is sincere.
- Oh, for God's sake!
- That's what I had in mind.
Frank, do I hear a little wave of jealousy drifting through O.R.?
Jealous?
How could I be jealous?
I'm a married man.
-  Hah!
- I heard that "Hah".
Will someone please change the subject?
- Why, did it wet itself?
- I read that a Japanese businessman while playing golf in a rainstorm, was struck by lightning in his zipper.
Shocking.
Medically speaking, he had his zip zapped.
- Was he all right?
- Oh, he's fine.
Ever since his accident, he's been crazy about "Stormy Weather".
##  ##  L-I think we're getting him.
Uh, Colonel Penobscott?
- Yes, sir.
It's Major Houlihan calling.
- You got him?
Here!
- You got him.
Right.
- Donald?
Donald?
- Why don't you sit - Oh, no, I'm fine.
- I just wanted to talk to you, darling.
- You have I know I could have written.
Oh, it's so good to hear your voice.
Well, did you get Mr. Hotsy Totsy on the phone?
- This is personal.
Please leave.
- I'm here on business.
- Have you got those papers I asked for?
- Papers?
- I'll find them myself.
- My monthly report!
Donald, I've been talking to a friend, and this friend suggests - and I agree - Time to get a few things straightened out.
That it's time to get a few things straightened out.
- Time to set the date.
- It's time to set the date.
- No, I realize you're busy, dear.
- Sure he's busy.
- Fraternizing with bathhouse bimbos.
- What's a bathhouse bimbo?
Start not listening for a change.
Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I mean, no, sir!
Right.
- Shut up!
Who is this friend?
No, I don't mind telling you that.
- No names!
- Major Frank Burns.
- Ooh!
You're scrunching my report.
- That's right.
Yes.
- That Frank Burns.
- You're scrunching Could you just - You will?
Oh, Donald, that's wonderful!
- Could I just - I can hardly wait to see you!
Bye!
- It took me a whole - Frank, you did it!
You've done it!
- Did what?
- Did what?
- He's coming here.
He wants to talk to you.
- What do you mean?
- He's coming here.
He's on his way Donald.
- Here?
Penobscott's coming here?
To MASH?
- Yes!
Yes!
He said he wants to straighten things out once and for all.
- Ease up, please.
Look what you did.
-  Sir, can I have two weeks' furlough?
- No.
- Oh, golly.
- Klinger!
- Pass off, Klinger.
You're always hogging the ball.
- That's no way to talk to a lady.
- It's a habit, guys.
In Toledo, if you pass the ball to somebody, they sell it.
- Let go, you crumb!
-  - Oh, sorry, Father.
- You fouled him, Colonel!
Radar, you wanna reorganize the entire filing system?
- Jump ball!
- Isn't it unusual for the ref to change his call?
Not if he's a corporal.
Colonel, l-I believe you're standing on my foot.
- It's only a friendly game, Father.
-   Get it, B. J!
Get it!
Get it!
- Over here!
No!
Hey, that's two!
Go!
Go!
Go!
-   -  Colonel!
-  Over here, Colonel!
Get it!
Over here, Father!
Get it, B.J.!
- Over here!
I'm on your side, Colonel!
-  - Colonel Potter?
- Yeah, what?
Lt.
Col.
Penobscott, sir.
Ah!
- Sherman Potter.
How do you do?
- A pleasure, sir.
- Captain Hunnicutt.
- Hi.
- Captain Pierce.
- Hello.
How are you?
- Lt.
Peters.
Father Mulcahy.
- Lieutenant.
Father.
Corporal Klinger.
Corporal O'Reilly.
Corporal.
Lieutenant Colonel?
Major.
Now there's your regulation hug.
Wow.
They must really like each other.
Then how come they close their eyes?
Oh.
Would you excuse us, Colonel, sir?
Of course.
Of course.
Gee, I'm so embarrassed.
I threw him the ball.
It was very sportsmanlike.
- Why don't we take a walk?
- Okay.
Not being one to gossip, but they seem like a nice-looking couple.
Strapping young man.
Academy, you know.
- West Point or Arthur Murray?
- We gonna play ball anymore?
I was getting hot.
Klinger, there's too much human drama unfolding.
Geez, I wonder what they're saying to each other.
She's saying, "Donald, darling, I'm not getting any younger, you know".
And he's saying, "Margaret, darling, I couldn't love you more.
But I promised myself not to marry until I made brigadier general".
"Let's not rush into this thing like a couple of crazy army kids".
"Donald, darling, I don't care what your rank is as long as it's lieutenant colonel or better".
"Kiss me, you fool".
Amazing.
How'd you know that?
- She was puckering.
- All right.
Knock off the eavesdropping.
Let's go over to the Mess Tent for a cup of joe.
Come on, Radar.
You'll only irritate your glands.
Ah, here they are, a handsome couple.
Klinger, why don't you get the major and the colonel some coffee.
- I'd be proud to.
- Oh, no, thanks.
Not now, Klinger.
Lt.
Col.
Penobscott has a little bomb to drop on all of you.
- How poetic.
- I haven't been bombed in a week.
I don't know how to say this, but, uh Major Houlihan and I would like to get married as soon as possible.
Why don't we toast the happy couple?
They're too big for our toaster.
We'd like to expedite our marriage because I'm due back in Tokyo in 48 hours.
- Father Mulcahy.
- Present.
Will you join us in wedlock?
Don't do it, Father.
Three's a crowd.
I'd be honored to marry you.
- I'm gonna cry.
I know I'm gonna cry.
- Steady, soldier.
Colonel, uh, what's the procedure?
- Radar?
- Uh, there's nothing to it, sir.
All you need is permission from your commanding officer and Form 1027 A. Uh, then you need your overseas nuptials in a combat zone Form 1136.
And then, uh, your embassy registration Form L1101.
All typed up nice and neat in triplicate.
- Don't forget the blood test.
- And then I marry you.
- Father, do you do Methodist?
- Piece of cake.
Oh, right.
Klinger, we'll need a cake.
Radar, warm up those forms.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
You're in charge of that.
- My first command.
- Morning, Major Burns.
- Morning.
- Major Frank Burns?
- Yes, sir?
No, sir.
That's him.
That's Frank Burns.
You're the man I wanna see.
- Hold it.
I wanna talk to you.
-  Donald!
Father, do you do Presbyterian funerals?
I'm innocent!
I never touched the girl!
I'm a happily married man!
- Hold still, Major!
- I don't know what anyone's told you but all we did was play chess, make chains out of rubber bands.
And last Christmas, we made little pussycat cookies.
Major Burns, at ease!
I'm trying to tell you how grateful I am to you.
- What?
- It's your fault I'm here.
You inspired Margaret into insisting we get married.
I'm indebted, and I'd like you to be our best man.
Really?
- ## - Radar?
- Yes, sir.
- What's the latest poop on the wedding?
Uh, Captain Pierce and Hunnicutt wanna give Colonel Penobscott a smoker.
Good.
Good.
Did you tell them no horsing around in class "A" uniforms at the wedding?
Yes, sir.
Captain Pierce says he's gonna be on his best behavior - but he won't wear pants.
- You tell him no pants, no champagne.
You gotta know how to handle these guys.
What else?
Cook baked a cake.
Chocolate frosting.
- Mmm!
Has anybody licked Oh.
Go on.
- I licked the spoon.
Uh, all the nurses want to give Major Houlihan a shower.
Probably want her real clean for the wedding.
- Just a joke.
- I know.
This your first marriage ceremony, Radar?
Oh, no, sir.
I was at my Uncle Ernie's.
- Fun?
- Oh, yeah.
They had potato salad and pecan pie, punch, turkey Jell-O, tongue sandwiches and chopped liver.
- Sounds wonderful.
- I threw up all over the flower girl.
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.
-  - Just some fruit juice and poison.
- Oh, well, then it can't possibly hurt.
Cheers.
-  Cheers!
Oh!
Oh!
- Too much fruit juice.
- Open your presents!
Yeah.
Don't forget your presents!
How terrific!
- Who's this from?
- That's from me.
- Hurry!
-  Back scratcher.
The colonel will love this.
He's got a little itch right there.
Ooh!
This way, when I'm not around, he won't need anybody else to scratch it.
Thanks.
Sorry I'm late.
I had to iron this dress.
Klinger, this is for ladies only.
Just a little something for the bride-to-be.
Oh, Klinger, how sweet.
In the words of my people "May your life be an oasis surrounded by waving palms warm breezes, and spit-free camels".
How touching.
-  - It's gorgeous.
- Oh!
- I always figured if I had a daughter I'd want her to wear that gown.
My Uncle Zack used it to get out of World War I. Don't tear it.
## - To the groom.
-  To the groom!
- Hear!
Hear!
- Gentlemen, may I say a word or two?
- Shh!
- I would just like to express my gratitude to all of you for your camaraderie and generosity on this, the eve of my wedlock.
Or hemlock, as the case may be.
May your house be filled with children and your garage filled with camels.
Camels!
Are you aware the one with the big nose is wearing earrings?
You shouldn't be looking around.
You're getting married tomorrow.
Oh, you're right.
I couldn't help notice.
He's He's a Gypsy.
To Toledo the stuffed grape leaf capital of the Midwest!
- To the Midwest!
- Grape leaves!
May I have the attention of everyone present?
I recognize the drunk from Indiana.
- More!
- "Penobenscott".
What makes you think you deserve such a fine, upstanding woman as Major Houli han?
-  -  Colonel Potter?
R-Radar?
Your permission to go out and get sick?
Gr-Granted.
Give him a hand.
- What'd he do?
- "Menobscott," you haven't answered my question.
- Burns, why don't you join Radar?
- The upchuck twins.
Sir, I'm speaking man to man, not officer to officer.
Well, then g-get on w-with it.
Well, what's so hot about you?
Well, in my class at the academy I was 396th out of 227.
I told you he was no dummy!
And at the Point water polo team, uh, hammer throw and "Greco-wrestle Romaning".
- All at the same time?
- You know I used to play water polo but my horse drowned.
Well, you should have kept his head up!
Stop laughing without me!
Burns, why don't you shut up, f-fall down and g-go to sleep.
Thank God someone cares.
- Father?
- Yeah?
Oh.
You haven't had, uh, much to say this evening.
I'm afraid I'm unaccustomed to the jocularity of the stag smoker.
I've been to one other.
Very exciting.
A nun jumped out of an angel food cake.
-  Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
- Wait a second.
Look at this.
- Oh, dear!
Well, he's he's had it.
Gimme Gimme a hand.
Oh, I got one.
Up we go here.
Okay.

He weighs a ton!
That's all his medals.
The guest of honor is drunk.
So am I. I'd say the the party's over.
Well Excuse me.
- Have a g-good night, fellas.
- Night.
- Good night, Colonel!
-  Good night.
Radar, get up.
You'll get You'll get dirt in your nose.
I know, but why are these tents doing in our yard, Uncle Ed?
- I'm not your Uncle Ed.
- Whoa!
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Father.
Go right home.
The jocularity is jocularity!
I gotta go.
I'm wearing a morning frock for the wedding.
I better shave my back.
Yeah, for God's sake, shave your back.
What are we gonna do with the bridegroom?
Let's put wheels on him and enter him in the Soap Box Derby.
No.
That's too square.
They like originality.
- Oh, we'll fix Margaret.
- What?
Let's slip him in bed with Nurse Carson.
Oh, wait.
I got a better idea.
Let's slip me in bed with Nurse Carson.
- Oh!
Oh, no, no!
- What?
- What?
What?
What?
Come on!
Come on!
- No!
No!
- It's too crazy!
- Come on.
Why don't you - No.
It's too crazy.
- What?
Put him in a body cast from his chest to his toes and tell him he broke his leg.
Oh, come on.
No.
That's too cruel.
That's vicious.
You're right.
It's perfect!
How-How'd Margaret take the good news?
Oh, she's handling it very well.
She punched a hole in her tent.
I itch all over.
Gee, I'm glad I didn't break my leg while I was asleep.
We'll tell 'em right after the ceremony.
You know, when the heat's on, you can be decent.
- I know.
- But rottenness is much more fun.
Klinger.
- This is it.
- Okay, I'll get her.
I hope I can get through this without crying my eyes out.
- You got tissue in your purse?
- Three hankies.
- Radar.
- What?
- Uh, music.
- Oh.
##  ## - Potter looks so dignified.
- That's because he's got a hangover that would kill his horse.
Ahem!
- ##  - Thank you.
- Radar!
- ##  Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
My friends, I'd like to take this opportunity to say a few words on the meaning of marriage.
It is called in the Scripture, "holy bonds".
But what kind of bonds are they that hold two people together - on the journey through life?
-  They are silken bonds.
Strong, yet gentle.
Unbreakable, yet yielding.
-  - Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Choppers!
Incoming wounded!
Incoming wounded!
- I'm sorry, God.
- Step on it, Father.
Uh, moving right along.
Uh, if any man objects to this union, speak now or forever hold your peace.
- Oh, I've nothing to say.
- Keep it moving, Father.
Do you, Margaret, take Donald to be your lawful wedded husband?
- I do.
- Do you, Donald, take Margaret to be your lawful wedded wife?
- I do.
- I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Colonel.
See you later, darling.
Hey!
Don't leave me!
-  - Oh!
This one's in shock and hemorrhaging.
A unit of whole blood.
Stat.
Come on.
Take him.
Okay, it's his leg.
Do a sterile prep.
Move it!
Hurry!
Pack his chest.
He's in pain.
M.S., one-quarter.
He'll be next in O.R. Come on.
Move it!
Move it!
We've got more coming!
- How many left?
- Two more in pre-op.
Fractured femur, and the other has abdominal wounds.
- Hell of a wedding for you, kid.
- More whole blood!
- Wow!
- What do you got, B.J.?
- Belly full of shrapnel.
- Me too.
It's beanbag time.
Ready to close.
General closure, but a peritoneum.
- Klinger.
- Captain?
Get that fractured leg in here.
Gimme a second.
I'll bring the whole guy in.
How's your head?
Oh, it's okay, Father.
I got a little shook up.
Colonel, I don't think this is a good idea.
No, I insist.
I want to see Margaret at work.
It'll bring us closer together.
But if you're not used to it, O.R. Can be very frightening.
I remember my first experience.
I couldn't eat liver for a year.
Padre, you're speaking to a combat veteran.
- I've seen it all.
- Up!
-  -   Hawk.
Hawk, I can't get to it.
Give me a hand.
Finish closing.
Move.
Retractors!
Margaret, suction some of that blood out of there.
Clamp!
Clamp!
Clamp!
There it is.
Sponge.
- All right, Father.
I've I've seen enough.
- Let's go.
- Have a good honeymoon!
- Oh, thanks.
- Bye.
It's been nice.
- Bless you, son.
Bon voyage.
- Thank you, Father.
- Have a nice honeymoon, Colonel.
- I'm sure it'll be all you ever expected.
- Thank you.
- Best of luck.
- Sorry about the accident, sir.
- Oh, that's all right.
- Well, do the best you can.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Enjoyed your wedding, sir.
-  -  Okay.
Bye.
Major, the bouquet!
Throw the bouquet!
- Good luck, Major.
- Thank you.
- Have a good time.
- Thank you.
- Bye, Margaret.
- Bye.
- Let's tell her, Hawk.
- You tell her.
You mixed the plaster.
One of us oughta tell her it's a joke.
- His leg is okay!
- The cast is a fake!
What?
- The cast, take it off!
- The cast!
Taking off!
- Oh, bye.
- Bye-bye!
- Thanks for everything!
- Oh, you're welcome!
- Bye, Major!
- Good-bye!
Oh, I sure am glad we told her.
We'll have to wire her in Tokyo, all right?
You think she can get the cast off all by herself?
Are you kidding?
She'll rip it off with her bare hands.
Bye, Margaret.
-  Feel all right, Frank?
- Oh, I feel great.
You guys don't have to sit up with me like I'm a baby or something.
Well, you're entitled to a little sympathy, under the circumstances.
- After all, you just lost a close friend.
- Oh, I don't feel badly.
I'm really very happy for Margaret.
- That's good, Frank.
That's healthy.
- Sure.
I just wish she'd been a little more cautious.
You know, I hate to see a girl, only been in the army 18 years rush off and marry the second real man she ever met.
What time is it in Tokyo now?
Mm, about, um, 10:00.
Oh, well.
They probably finished dinner by now.
Had a few drinks.
Strolled through the Japanese garden at the hotel.
Those gardens are very romantic.
Oh, yeah.
They're probably wandering over toward the elevators now.
Where you going, Frank?
I don't know.
Uh, just felt like grabbing a cold shower.
- That's not a bad idea.
- Uh-huh.
