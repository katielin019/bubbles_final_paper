{START OF EPISODE 1}
The American military presence in Korea is unlike any in our nation's history.
Our troops are fighting side by side with 17 other United Nations forces.
All in all, a very unique situation.
But I can tell you one group that may be suffering an adverse effect the 4077 MASH.
I've been getting reports that treating casualties so close to the front is beginning to take its toll.
I'm going to send you up to that unit for the purpose of conducting a psychiatric evaluation.
Your recommendation will determine if they are to be disbanded and its members shipped to other units.
The 4077 is under the command of Lt.
Col.
Henry Blake.
A fine surgeon, Henry.
A fair-to middlin'administrator.
Blake's people are very devoted to him.
And I must say, he is highly thoughtful of them.
- Morning, Henry.
- Morning, dear.
Morning.
Oh.
That will be two kisses, please.
Here you go.
Mmm.
And here's your change.
Blake's company clerk is a, uh, Corporal Radar O'Reilly.
There are times, I must confess, when it seems Henry Blake is Corporal O'Reilly's clerk.
Sign these, sir.
- What am I signing, Radar?
- Uh, this is a request to rectify last week's supply foul-up from Quartermasters' Corps.
Was there another foul-up in Quartermaster last week?
In duplicate and triplicate, sir.
Uh, yes, sir.
They sent 2,000 specimen cups by mistake.
Two thousand.
Came in the same order as the 400 breast pumps.
- Gee, that's an awful lot - Lot of breast pumps.
Yes, sir.
- If you'll just initial this, please.
- Just initial?
The initial signifies that you signed instead of initialed it.
- Right.
- Thank you.
Then there's the chief nurse of the 4077, Maj.
Margaret Houlihan.
An angel of mercy, Maj.
Houlihan.
A woman dedicated to giving relief to others.
Oh, Margaret.
That's delicious.
Maj.
Frank Burns is the unit's ranking surgeon.
A very competent doctor, but a bit of a prude, if you should ask me.
Margaret, when you touch me, my knees turn to pudding.
Frank, I'll get all messy.
You're going to need a bath, you naughty girl.
Maj.
Burns billets with two other doctors captains both Pierce and Mclntyre.
Two exceptionally qualified surgeons, but in their off-hours, their antics can become quite antic.
Separately, they're a handful.
Who rewrote these Commandments?
Hawkeye, don't.
I can't help it.
Even as a child, I used to play with my food.
Together, Pierce and Mclntyre make a remarkable pair.
Gimme three.
Uh, two, please.
Everybody ready?
Two kings.
Three threes.
- Full house.
- Ahh!
Pay up!
Turn your back.
My concern is that the 4077 is operating under more pressure than it can stand.
More and more, we're forced to use green troops.
And green troops have a way of turning hospitals into standing-room-only.
Hot stuff!
This one's in shock!
This guy's still breathing!
Get your butt over here!
- I need some help.
Hold this.
- Are you clean?
Hold that.
I need some more sponges.
- Longfingers.
- Longfingers.
- We're getting close, Pierce.
- Grab that bowel, Henry.
- Wait a minute.
- I don't think he's got a minute.
Come on.
More lap sponges, damn it.
- Here we go.
- Can we watch our language, please?
Anytime you want to kick me out of this country club I'll second your blackball.
- Can we watch our language, please?
- Pierce, you do good work.
Oh, yeah.
Another three or four wars, I'll be sensational.
We're about to button this kid up.
Let's get the next one in.
Move it!
-  - What happened?
- Phosphorous burns.
- Water, copper sulfate, quick!
- How do they ship a kid like this?
- They put him out once.
The breeze in the chopper started it up again.
- Get some water on there.
- Out of the way.
Get the fire out first, boys.
Get the fire out first.
- Move him in.
Let's go!
- I'll take care of this myself.
Klinger!
I told you to get out of those clothes.
Not till I'm discharged, sir.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You'll get your dress dirty.
As a psychiatrist, you'll be able to tell whether the 4077 can still function as a team.
And for your purposes, it might be best to reveal the true nature of your mission only to Col.
Blake.
Break us up?
But you can't break us up.
I mean, we've been together so long, we're like a family.
Families go their separate ways sometimes, Colonel.
Children grow up, leave.
I understand.
I mean, uh I mean, you're not gonna write down everything I say to you, are you?
I have a report to make, sir.
Oh, of course.
- Like a brandy, Captain?
- No, thanks.
Gin?
Scotch?
Rye?
Beer?
I got it all.
Don't get the idea that I drink.
I mean, it's just that, uh, you know, uh, every now and then there's a lot of pressure around here, and, uh, you know Not that there's a lot of pressure or anything like that.
It's just that every now and then, like your least little pressure, it'll build up to an incredible amount of pressure around here!
Radar.
- Would you bring in some brandy?
- Thought you might like some brandy.
That'd be real nice.
Um, Capt.
Hildebrand doesn't care for any.
Oh.
Then I won't bring his glass in.
Great little kidder, that one.
But a crackerjack clerk.
Look, you just tell me who it is you want to interview, and he'll line 'em all up for you.
My orders are to make discreet observations, Colonel.
There will be no interviews.
Gee whiz, I'd sure like to know what put this bee in Gen.
Clayton's bonnet.
The 4077 is one of the most committed, responsible bunch of people I've ever had the privilege of being associated with.
-  - Excuse me.
Hello.
Yeah, well, show him in.
I mean, we have really got some Morning, sir.
X rays of the patient with the phosphorous burns, sir.
- Oh, uh, thank you, Klinger.
- Will that be all, sir?
That's more than enough, Klinger.
- I can explain that.
- So can I. I mean, it's not what it looks like.
What do you think it looks like?
Well, I think it looks terrible.
Well, then, that's what it looks like.
Oh, there's nothing wrong with Klinger.
I mean, he goes out with girls.
He must be stealing their clothes.
Ah, he's just bucking for a discharge, that's all.
He wants out on a psycho.
You know.
It's logical.
Psycho.
I'm familiar with the word, Colonel.
Oh, of course.
I'd like to get started in the morning, first thing.
Well, let me get the billeting on that for you.
Uh, Radar, uh, would you, uh - Capt.
Hildebrand is gonna spend a day - Or two.
Or two.
He's gonna spend some time with us before he leaves.
- Yes, sir.
- Please assign him to the V.D. Tent.
- I mean, the P.I.B. Tent.
- Follow me, sir.
Uh, the P.I.V. Tent.
The P -  Colonel?
- Yo.
Remember, Colonel Not a word.
You have my word.
Yes, sir.
Hawkeye?
Captain?
She seemed more like a lieutenant to me.
Captain, it's me, Radar.
You've got to get up.
Get out of here, Radar, or I'll sever every nerve in your butt.
It's Col.
Blake.
He says it's urgent.
What is it, a patient?
No, just the colonel.
He needs you in the shower.
You think he'd be old enough to know where everything is.
All I know is he says it's important.
Trapper?
Trapper?
- Trap -  Look, okay.
I know it's dumb to be in here.
But Clayton sent this joker Hildebrand to spy on us.
And I figured the shower was the safest place to meet.
Right?
Absolutely.
Nobody ever comes in here.
- To cover our voices.
-  What?
- To cover our - You got a case of galloping paranoia.
Never mind.
Now look.
I'm the only one who knows this guy's a psychiatrist.
And you still got the guts to wear that?
Pierce, can you lay off the wisecracks for just five minutes?
Oh, he always acts funny in a men's shower.
Look, what I'm asking you guys is make that commanding.
- Keep it asking.
- It's to for pete sakes stop acting like a couple of horse's patoots while Hildebrand is here.
Or sure as God made little green apples, he's gonna break us up.
And I don't think any of us really want that to happen.
I mean, as screwy as this outfit is, better the devil you know, right?
- You've got our word, Henry.
Right?
- Yeah.
- Promise?
- Promise.
Thanks.
Henry?
Your fly is closed.
-  Yes?
- Major?
- Who is it?
- It's me, Henry Blake.
- Just a minute.
Go.
-  Come in, Colonel.
Hi.
Uh, we were just going over tomorrow's duty roster.
The one on my desk?
He means yesterday's duty roster tomorrow.
Never mind.
I've got something serious to discuss.
- Sir - What is it A Capt.
Hildebrand showed up today from Headquarters in Seoul.
He's a psychiatrist, and he's here on Clayton's orders.
Now, it is my guess that someone in this unit has been rat-finking to the general on the sly.
It wasn't me.
Anyway, it was my duty to.
There is nothing wrong with reporting the unmilitary posture of your command.
Just let me remind you, Mrs. MacArthur, that if this unit gets split up, it might just happen that we all get split up.
Which means that you and Burns will have to stop practicing medicine together.
And whatever else it is you've been practicing.
- Sir I'm sorry.
- What the hell - Everything's taken care of.
- Good.
Everybody's agreed to behave themselves in front of Capt.
Hildebrand - and make the place look real G.I. - Very, very good.
- I want every golf club out.
- I took all golf clubs and hid them.
- Sew the hole in the shower.
- I sewed the hole in the nurses' tent.
And I took Klinger's bras and I burned them.
##  ## ## Hey!
Somebody give the place a shove!
## - What is that?
- This motel is surrounded by soldiers.
It's disgusting that you sleep in your underwear.
It beats sleeping in yours.
We're all gonna make nice for Capt.
Hildebrand today, but don't push us.
Well, a shave wouldn't be a bad start.
You both look more like bums than doctors.
Actually, I was thinking of becoming a bum doctor, but the proctology class was full.
Ha, ha, ha.
- What is that?
- "What is that" what, Frank?
Why is someone's appendix in this boot?
Because the other one is full of tonsils.
Uh, Captain?
Captain Hildebrand, good morning.
- Good morning.
- How about breakfast?
It's how a very typical day starts here.
- Good idea.
-  Attention.
Colonel Blake at 16 uh, 1700 hours will deliver his weekly lecture.
Tonight's subject will be "Togetherness".
The lecture will be followed by a talk on the perils of trench mouth.
I'll have two scrambled powdered eggs and a slice of World War II surplus bread, and don't make it tasty.
-  I'd like some coffee.
- Wouldn't we all?
There we go.
Pierce, Mclntyre, I'd like you to meet Capt.
Hildebrand.
- He's here to, um, to observe.
- Your surgical technique.
Oh, really?
You got a specialty?
- Uh, gynecology.
- Nose and throat.
Well, you were close, Henry.
Uh, mind if we join you?
We were going to join the nurses.
Yeah, we were going to join them and make one big nurse.
Frank, care for a little company, buddy?
- Plenty of room for everyone.
- Thanks, pal.
Could I have the salt down there, buddy?
Listen, could you take it easy with the "buddy" talk?
I've got a weak stomach.
Thanks.
Oh, uh, Maj.
Burns, general surgeon, Capt.
Hildebrand, nose, throat and bloomers.
Hey, Frank.
I took a look at that kid whose bowel you resected this morning.
That was some job.
- What was wrong with it?
- Not a thing!
You ought to put your monogram on that scar, Frank.
That was a thing of beauty.
Well, I don't like to brag, but that is my specialty.
Oh, I mean to tell you.
One look, and I can see your hand all over that gut.
Uh, Colonel, may I have the butter, please?
- Henry?
The butter.
- Hmm?
Oh, here you go, "Piercelntyre".
The men are always complimenting each other's work.
We're thinking of going into practice together when we get home.
- Isn't that right, Trap?
- We're gonna open our own clinic.
That's right.
The three of us war buddies would run the place.
Frank would park the cars.
Great, great leg-pullers, these guys.
Is there room for one more?
Well, Capt.
Hildebrand, this is Maj.
Houlihan.
- How do you do?
Nice to meet you.
- Delighted to meet you.
She's our head nurse.
Best one in Korea.
Every nurse I've ever known takes a backseat to the major.
Thank you.
And you're talking to a man who's taken a lot of nurses into backseats.
- Miz Scarlet.
- Thank you, Captain Pierce.
Pass the butter, will you, Pierce?
Thank you.
One big, happy family, aren't we?
Well mm-hmm.
## ##  Who is it?
Who   Attention, please.
Immediately following mass this Sunday, Yom Kippur services will be held for all Jewish personnel of the Hebrew faith.
Childish.
Not childlike, with its connotations of innocence and joyous abandon, but childish.
Delight in petty bickering, summer-camp capers, and in general behave in a manner ill befitting officers in the United States Army and members of the medical profession.
It is to some degree understandable.
You are, after all, only three miles from the front.
You would not be the first people to crack under the stress of war.
I resent that, Captain.
I, for one, have not cracked because of the war.
- That's true, Captain.
- Thank you, Pierce.
Frank showed up here cracked.
With a Bible in one hand and a pair of shorts that said "hold me" in the other.
- Pierce!
- Oh, come on, Henry.
The party's over.
- Now, listen.
Don't pay any attention - No, he's right, Colonel.
Even tipping them off couldn't keep them from behaving the way they really feel.
How would you feel, Captain, if you were forced to serve alongside a pair of medical misfits?
Olé!
And this one has no respect for decency.
He turns everything into a hollow mockery.
That's a lie.
I've never once taken out the insides of a mockery.
He's right, Captain.
They're both impossible.
You stay out of this, Hot Lips, or I'll stop selling tickets to your shower day.
-  -  - All right.
Steady, people.
- You are no gentlemen.
- Good thing you are.
- How d "I d-d" While you're writing, make note of the fact that thanks to the failure of the world's various elected heads, not to mention just plain dictators, to keep a cold war from turning hot, I am forced to operate alongside a surgeon who can't trim his toenails without committing malpractice.
I resent that.
- How do you know he meant you?
- Well, who else?
I mean, uh Uh, Captain, we're not as bad as we seem.
There isn't a nurse in camp they haven't tried to molest.
Except the male ones.
- Speak for yourself.
-  That one spies on everybody.
Now, dear, he is our son.
- He is not!
- Sir - He is not!
- Sir - Radar, what the hell is it?
- Choppers.
More wounded.
-  -  We need some sponges here.
Okay, who ordered the pepperoni pizza?
I need some plasma over here!
- Here, give me the longfingers.
- How's it going, Frank?
He's fine.
He's young.
Need some more light, please.
- It's not the light, it's the blood.
- Everything okay, Pierce?
- Get somebody to give us some sponges.
- You got it.
- Sponges are here.
- I've got a lot of bleeding here.
Nurse, gown and gloves, on the double.
This is no good.
I need suction here.
-  Suction.
-  Clean it out.
Clamp.
That's better.
I can see a little better.
- Excuse me.
- How are you?
Scissors and pickups.
- Scissors, pickups.
- All right.
Okay.
That's better.
Now we're cookin'.
Here we go.
Clamp.
Clamp.
We may need some How did Notre Dame do?
Okay, sew him up and give him his bill.
- Oh!
-  Ten-hut!
Thought I might have a word with Capt.
Hildebrand.
Oh, uh, Capt.
Brildehan Hildebrand.
Yes, sir.
Uh, well, I don't know where he is.
He's, uh - He's probably at the, um -  Over here.
Mon generale.
Capt.
Hildebrand!
These guys make a gin that can melt your dog tags.
Comes from a recipe first brewed in Hermann Goering's navel and handed down from war to war.
- You had a mission here.
- I can give you your report.
In my short stay here, I have seen textbook examples of neuroses, psychoses.
I have seen voyeurism, fetishism and a few "isms" I never even heard of.
And let me tell you this, General: These impossible people are in an impossible place doing totally impossible work.
They're mad, quite mad, all of them.
And the only act I can think of that would be madder still would be breaking them up.
Well, we did it again.
Screwed up in reverse.
We'll never get out of here.
- Um, have a drink, General?
- It's 8:00 in the morning.
Well, I'd like to propose a little toast.
Well - Still in the same tent?
- No, sir.
They moved me out.
Here you go, General.
The finest kind.
Attention.
Be sure to follow the zany antics of our combat surgeons as they cut and stitch their way along the front lines, operating as bombs operating as bombs and bullets burst around them, snatching laughs and love between amputations and penicillin.
Follow Hawkeye Pierce, TrapperJohn Mclntyre, Henry Blake, Hot Lips Houlihan, Frank Burns, Radar O'Reilly and Corporal Klinger.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
## ## - Hold on, just a second, just a second.
- How much?
Gimme the money.
Okay, you got it.
All right, fine.
Do you have a bet?
All right.
Okay.
Hold it.
I'll give you Okay.
Attention, all personnel.
Attention.
Three minutes to Charlie.
Repeat.
Three minutes to Charlie.
Try to feel compassionate.
Remember, even one of our saints received a "DearJohn" letter.
Attention, all personnel.
Attention.
Three minutes to Charlie.
Has anyone picked 40 yards, Radar?
- Uh, oh, no, Father.
It's still open.
- Good, good.
If I'm lucky, the proceeds go to the Bible fund.
Oh, me too.
I say, Reggie, you come here often?
- Only when my horse is running.
- Rather!
Ah, our turf accountant.
Jolly good.
You guys got the same place as yesterday?
Of course, my good man, and be quick about it.
Trapper, you're 47.
Hawkeye, 62.
- Good show.
Carry on.
- Hip, hip.
- Right-o.
- Cheerio.
You guys got a cold?
Won't be long now.
Stand by for Charlie.
- Take cover!
- Air raid!
What air raid?
It's Five o'clock Charlie.
He's the enemy trying to destroy us from the sky!
Oh, come on, Frank.
He's been trying for six weeks.
- He hasn't hit anything yet.
- He washed out of kamikaze school.
He's a loner, Frank, a misfit.
He's an airborne menace, and he's going to bomb us!
Well, he has a lovely day for it, hasn't he, Reggie?
- Oh, hear, hear.
- Where, where?
Frank, give them a direct order.
Oh, do, Frank.
We've never ignored one of those.
I'm a major!
You're only captains.
- That's just an accident of birth.
- Yes, we were born majors.
Someone switched us in our cribs.
- Very funny.
- True.
We're twins.
Identical majors.
- Shall we?
- Rather.
How can you clown this way?
Don't you realize the danger you're in?
- Frank, you realize for us.
- And you protect us, Uncle Frank.
ByJove, I believe I hear Charlie.
- Who put water in my gun?
- How do you know it's water?
- This isn't even Where is my gun?
- We sold it.
- We beat it into plowshares.
- It's not funny, hiding my weapon!
I say, shall we toddle off?
Oh, yes.
No one's seated after the first act.
- Metzenbaum scissors.
- Metz.
- I can't see anything.
Retractor.
- Big or little?
The big one.
Boy, this kid's got more junk in him than a used car lot.
Attention.
Attention.
One minute to Charlie.
The betting book is now closed.
Here he comes, that old bugger.
Right on time.
- What's your number, Ginger?
- Thirty-two and a half yards.
Forget it, honey.
You haven't got a chance.
Three-oh-chromic, G.I. - What number have you got?
- You got two instruments here.
Just one at a time.
That's a girl.
Well, I'm not saying.
I'm not saying.
Two of mine were stolen last week.
- Gimme some more retraction.
- My little arms are breaking already.
Thirty-two and a half yards.
You're out of your pretty little mind, honey.
All right, Doctor, let's clean this place up.
That's a boy.
How can you sit there and just let yourself get bombed?
- One good bombing deserves another.
- Down in front, Frank.
- Honestly, you can't take him anywhere.
- ## And now, direct from North Korea, here he is for the sixth hit week Five o'clock Charlie, his airplane and his astigmatism!
- Ah, there he is Charles.
- Oh, yes.
- Hello, Charles!
- I say, he's got a cough today.
- It's a wonder he can fly at all.
- Oh, yes.
- He looks rather peaked to me.
- Fragile.
Well done, Charles!
Jolly good.
Jolly good.
- But he missed.
- Ah, yes.
Bad luck, Charles.
See you tomorrow.
And that concludes Five o'clock Charlie for today, folks.
Hope you enjoyed him as much as North Korea enjoyed bringing him to you.
Results of the pool will be announced in just a few minutes.
Join us tomorrow, same time.
Until then, have a nice war.
Say, shall we repair to the digs and wait for the results?
Good idea.
We're nearly out of plasma.
Nurse, you're out of uniform.
- Where?
- How about my place in five minutes?
- Colonel!
- Frank, Charlie is like one of our own.
I mean, how else would we know it's 5:00 if he didn't come over and try to blast that ammo dump?
Why can't anyone take this seriously?
It's cute, huh?
I got this little outfit in the Tokyo P.X. Last week.
Colonel, I must insist I didn't know they were naked underneath.
You're not supposed to look under there.
Colonel, I insist you do something about these raids!
Aw, gimme a break, Frank.
Get off my back.
Well, history certainly repeats itself.
Nobody listened to Billy Mitchell either.
Who's Billy Mitchell?
A general who advocated a strong air force.
- Gary Cooper played him.
- I thought he played Sergeant York.
He did, but he also played Billy Mitchell and Lou Gehrig.
And he was for a strong air force.
Hey, that's pretty surprising for a first baseman.
I am certain that General Clayton would send us an antiaircraft gun.
And I am sure that General Clayton is not in the rent-a-gun service.
And anyway, who'd shoot the thing?
Well, I've had some gunnery experience.
I was in the R.O.T.C.
You'd think a man with R.O.T.C.
Training wouldn't go peeking up a doll's skirt.
- Well, I am a doctor.
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyway, what about calling the general?
- I can't call the general, Frank.
General Clayton's not in his office, sir.
They'll call back.
- I didn't want to talk to him anyway.
- Well, he's not there.
This is yours, sir.
You came closest with 75-1/2 yards.
- There's almost a hundred bucks there!
- Zowie!
Holy moley!
CorporalJohnson came next with 22-3/4.
- Oh, yeah?
- This is insane!
Nobody bet on the Battle of Britain.
"He who controls the skies controls the war".
Hermann Goering said that.
Yeah, well, he also wore tutus and ate whole bakeries, Frank.
- I'll file these forms.
- Yeah, file those forms.
Whoops!
Hi, Henry.
Just heard the great news.
Hey, congratulations, Henry.
You got a contract out on Henry, Frank?
We're having a poker game in the Swamp tonight.
Saved you a seat.
- If you can't make it, just send money.
- This calls for a celebration.
- General Clayton, sir.
- Oh, thanks, Radar.
Henry Blake here.
Get me General Clayton right away, please.
Oh, this is General Clayton.
Well, Henry Blake here.
H-How are you, General?
Oh, just fine.
No, no, sir, no.
I'm afraid you were a little short.
Well, no, I think you had, uh, uh Radar?
- Fifty-two yards, Colonel.
- Fifty-two yards, Colonel.
Right.
Uh, oh, sir, excuse me.
While I've got you on the pipe, the suggestion's been made that we could use an oh-four W.W. "nug".
Yeah, that's right, sir.
A nug so that we can, uh, uh What's a nug, sir?
Well, a nug is a, uh A gun, sir.
A 40 "M.M." gun.
- Henry, you gotta be kidding!
- We definitely do not need a nug.
- Keep your snoots out of this!
- We don't need a gun or a nug.
What are you trying to do, get us into the war?
General, listen, you send a gun up here and that's gonna draw fire.
- That won't do our wounded much good.
- Give me that!
Get rid of the ammo dump and we won't need a gun!
Do you mind?
The previous suggestion is contraindicated.
We need an antiaircraft gun desperately, General!
Frank, how would you like a spontaneous nose job?
Henry Blake again, General.
What's that, sir?
Uh-huh, yeah, sure.
Check on that.
Put him down for 64 yards for tomorrow.
Hawkeye and Trapper have 64 yards.
- Well, give it to him.
- What difference does it make?
Stupid.
Yes, sir.
You've got a bet, sir.
Sixty-four yards.
What's that, sir?
Oh, yes, yes, sir, that's a good idea, as always.
Well, yes, sir.
Thank you.
Nice Bye.
Well, he's coming up tomorrow to look over the situation.
You better tell Hot Lips to warm up a merry widow.
Oh, now, that's filthy!
Henry, it's insane to arm this place.
Will you just keep your pants on till Clayton gets here?
He'll decide.
Honestly, you all make me sick!
I think he means we're contraindicated.
Someday all of this will come out: Your behavior, your filthy language, your betting on the enemy.
And believe me, it'll be a shameful page for Uncle Sam.
Oh, Frank, look, the general's comin' up here.
- Isn't that good enough for ya?
- Yeah, what more do you want?
I want everybody to understand that this is war and that war is a call to arms.
Here's our money, mister.
Don't staple us.
Someday all this will come out.
- Terribly sorry, Padre.
- Oh, that's all right, General.
I'll just turn the other cheek.
Get yourself something to eat, Sergeant.
Psst!
Margaret!
Quickly, before word gets out that I'm here.
Uh, y-you know Major Burns?
Major Frank Burns?
Yes, of course.
Burns.
We wanted to talk to you before anybody else about the gun.
- There's a war on, General.
- I read the papers.
The major and l we two majors feel that the colonel and a certain two captains That's two majors against a colonel and two captains.
What the major is trying to say, General, is that we feel they will - The colonel and two captains.
- Try to influence you against the gun.
Nothing can make a general's mind up for him.
I'll decide this matter myself.
Attention!
Five minutes to Charlie.
Five minutes.
- Now's your chance, General.
- I'd better tell Blake I'm in camp.
- Major, I'll want to discuss this later.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Privately!
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry, sir.
Sorry.
Oh, it's classic, Henry.
The ammo dump, the road.
Store material near hospitals so the enemy will leave it alone.
Hmm?
Learned it from the Germans.
Great.
Now we're taking lessons from the losers.
General, listen.
Instead of trying to knock out Charlie, just get rid of this.
That'll keep him away.
Or does that make too much sense?
Well, I really don't think a gun is necessary.
- Do you, Henry?
- Certainly not.
Unless you think I should think otherwise.
No, I don't think that.
And we have a new winner in the "definite maybe" sweepstakes.
One minute to Charlie!
One minute!
Uh, sir, I think we might be safer behind that rock back there.
Good thinking, Henry.
And here he is, for your wartime pleasure, the one and only Five o'clock Charlie!
Way to go, Charlie!
I knew I should have bet on the jeep today.
- Henry?
- Yes, sir?
You've got your gun.
To the right flank, "harch"!
To the rear, harch!
Detail, halt, two, three.
Men, I don't have to tell you of the importance of our mission.
We are the first surgical unit to have an antiaircraft capability.
Our success is vital.
I repeat, vital.
The eyes of the military are upon us.
Now, first off, um, any of you speak, uh, English?
Yes, sir, also French, Italian and a little German.
Sehr gut.
Then you will be platoon leader.
- I thought that you were platoon leader.
- Oh, well, I am.
But for purposes of our table of organization, I am the commander.
So you will be platoon leader, you will be squad leader, and you will be the squad.
The enemy very foolishly attacks at the same time every day.
There's no element of surprise.
The man does not possess an ounce of cleverness, which shows you the limitation of Oriental thinking.
No offense.
Hep, hup, hip, four.
Hep, hup, hip, four.
Hep, hup, hip, four.
Hep, hup, hip, four.
To the rear, march!
Hep, hup, hip, four!
To the rear, march!
Hep, hup, hip, four.
To the right flank, march!
To the rear, march!
To the left flank, march!
To the rear, march!
Halt!
Right and left face!
Cut that out, face!
Count off!
- Are you one?
- Yes, are you?
That's not funny.
Count off!
- One.
That's about it.
- Two.
Okay.
At ease.
That strikes me funny, not.
I think it ill behooves us Behooves?
What are we, in the cavalry now?
I think it ill behooves us to show such a frivolous and flippant attitude in front of our Korean allies.
Come on, Frank, don't you understand?
Fire draws fire.
You shoot that thing and the next day we'll have real planes, MIGs down here throwing bombs at our wounded.
Maybe you haven't noticed in the operating room, but we do have wounded.
The combination of malpractice and flop sweat makes it hard for him to see.
I know what my duty is, and I intend to do it!
- Fall in!
-  About face!
Forward march!
Hep, hup, hep, four.
Hep, hup, hep, four.
Hep, hup, hep, four.
Attaboy, Frank!
Flush 'em outta the sky!
How we gonna stop Frank?
On one of his nocturnal visits to Hot Lips, we sew him to the tent.
No.
They'd wiggle out of that.
He'd probably love it too.
I know I would.
What about this?
A skin graft over his mouth so he can't give the command to fire.
- He's trigger-happy.
- He can taste that plane.
I wish it would fly down his throat.
- It's not an uncommon phenomenon.
- Hmm?
For medical men and professional guys to get gung ho.
The 325th has a paratrooper rabbi.
- A real rabbi?
- Oh, yeah.
- A paratrooper?
- In every way.
Except he won't jump on Saturdays.
Fascinating, but it doesn't help.
Maybe we're too sober.
Cardozo, booze?
When I left the States, I promised my wife that I wouldn't have a drink or another woman till I got back to her.
- That's nice.
- Gimme a blast.
Make it a short one.
I got a date tonight.
You know, I been listening.
You guys want another opinion?
You're only a dentist.
Yeah.
To you, life is something wet that hardens overnight, then you put gold on it.
What you wanna do is forget about Frank.
I mean, his kind is indestructible.
They always have been.
- That's your opinion?
- Yeah.
Play, Phil.
Sing, dentist.
What you want to do is get rid of the dump.
You take away the dump, you take away the gun.
You take away the gun, you take away Frank's motivation and the menace is gone.
Just for that idea, we're gonna put you in the Christmas play.
Yeah, you can be the talking cavity.
But l-I can't give you four dozen sheets.
Oh, come on, Klein, you never turned us down before.
Yeah, but four dozen sheets?
- We just met four dozen great girls.
- Four dozen!
A requisition for 18 gallons of Mercurochrome?
Yeah.
We got a patient with an enormous cut.
I never had a martini that way.
May I?
Oh, please.
Goes great with a soap chaser.
Mmm!
I gotta hand it to us, Trap.
We have made that ammo dump absolutely unmissable.
- Even for Charlie.
- Two hours to show time.
It'll be over.
And poor Frank won't be able to play with his "ack-ack" anymore.
Hey, let's do something nice for him.
All right.
How about a couple of C.C.'s of the plague?
- We could name an infection after him.
- Or make him the infection.
Either way, it's a nice gesture.
- I just had a terrible idea.
- Hmm?
What if that creep gets lucky and hits Charlie before Charlie hits the dump?
We'd better take care of that contingency.
Hey!
This is the nurses' shower!
I waited as long as I could.
She's late today.
Okay, watch it!
Here he comes.
Hurry!
Hi, Frank.
Down this way.
- We think it's an early abscess.
- Well, why call on me?
Because when it comes to pus, we always think of you.
This is your arena.
Post-op infections, that's you.
Problem is he should've had antibiotics immediately.
You waited too long.
Now you've got a fever on your hands.
Fantastic.
He goes right to the heart of the clinical picture.
He's got eyes in the back of his stethoscope.
Doctor, I'm getting ready to do the You do that, Ginger.
Give him the 4:30 feeding.
Kind of fun working like this, huh, guys?
- We got to pull together more, Frank.
- Yeah.
Amen to that, old buddy.
That's Charlie.
Why, it can't be, Frank.
It's only 4:30.
I know Charlie when I hear him.
Impossible.
You You sneaks!
I've got to get to that gun.
It's Pearl Harbor all over again!
Attention.
Two minutes to Charlie.
- Two minutes to Charlie.
- Take your positions, men!
Uh, uh, uh Uh, uh, uh - 180 degrees point south.
- 180 degrees.
- By 270 point west.
- 270.
- On a sixty degree azimuth due north.
- Sixty!
- A 60 degree azimuth.
Do I hear 65?
- I bid 65!
- Wait a minute.
He said sixty.
- Sixty!
- I'm sorry, sir, we already have a 65.
- 65.
- I said 65!
- Let's start all over.
- Colonel!
- I have a colonel.
Do I hear a general?
- I'll bid a general, one star.
- One!
- A one-star general.
Do I hear two?
- Two!
Come on, we're not gonna let this fine war go for just a two-star general.
Henry, what they're doing is mutiny!
- That's a little strong, Frank.
- I'm placing you both under arrest!
I'm losing him.
Fire, damn it!
Fire!
- But, sir - You heard him, soldier.
Fire!
Hell of a shot, Frank.
So, as he flies the Blue Lady of the Skies into the sunset, we say aloha, Five o'clock Charlie, and return to our duties.
Let me remind you the hospital is open 24 hours for your dining and dancing pleasure.
- Did you see this stuff on vein grafts?
- Yeah, that's fantastic.
I bet that cuts down on amputations by 50 percent.
Or better.
- You know, I could eat.
- Yeah.
Hey, it's ten after 5:00.
- I miss him.
- Me too.
Hey, tell the truth, Frank.
Don't you miss Charlie?
- Oh, I forgot.
You did.
- Oh, Hawk, that's in bad taste.
- If I did, it was all your fault!
- Frank, why don't you join us?
You don't mind eating with a couple of"peacemongers," do you?
- No.
- Come on, Frank.
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, we're your two buddies.
Come on, Frank.
Why can't I stay mad at you two lugs?
We'll work something out.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
To: Headquarters, Seoul, Commanding General.
From:4077th MASH, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake, commanding officer.
Subject: Weekly activity report and personnel record.
Period: 17 October, 22 October, inclusive, 1951.
17 October.
Incoming wounded unusually heavy.
All surgical personnel on full alert working 24 hours.
Radar?
Uh, would you toss me the keys to the linen room, please?
Thanks, pal.
Among incoming surgical cases: One enemy prisoner.
Subheading: Infantry.
Subheading: Chinese Communist.
Description of prisoner wound attached see schedule under Wounds, Chinese, Communist.
Details of incident in O.R. Follows.
Pickups.
You're new here.
Yes, sir.
Lieutenant Erika Johnson.
You're built very nicely for a lieutenant.
Another suture.
I'm Hawkeye.
A little suction here, okay?
Nice touch.
Beautiful eyes.
If you do windows, you're hired.
- There's too much chatter in here.
-  Forget it, Frank.
- Just operate.
- Is that what he's doing?
I've seen better surgeons at religious sacrifices.
I've been operating for years and never had any complaints from my patients.
How many talking horses are there?
- Got any plans for later?
- No.
More suction.
How about a cup of coffee?
Go for a ride in an ambulance with the top down?
- Okay.
- Great.
Just my luck, under that mask you don't have any teeth.
In that case, the date's off.
Not necessarily.
I've been here a long time.
Okay, this kid's all ready to go.
He's all retreaded.
Let's go.
Get him out of here.
Come on.
Let's go.
You're gonna be okay, pal.
You got a new team here?
Oh, boy, look what this guy's got.
Look at that.
What is this?
Are we operating on Communists now?
He's a wounded prisoner, Frank.
They brought him in with the last batch.
- He's had 50 of Demerol.
-  Take it easy, Hawk.
The way they're brainwashed, he thinks we're gonna carve him up and eat him.
Bungchow.
That means peace and friendship.
Gwen, let me see this other picture here.
He's got a small bullet wound in the rump.
Yeah.
Okay, put him under.
In cases like this, an hour after you operate you're hungry again.
-  - Hey, kiddo, get back on the table!
Get away from here, you nut!
All right, watch it.
He's got a knife.
- What's he gonna do?
-  Careful.
All right, just stay calm everybody.
Don't panic.
Calm down.
Nobody move.
Help, guard!
Mayday!
- Bungchow!
- Somebody grab him!
Bungchow!
Bungchow!
-  -  There goes the I.V.!
He's contaminated the whole field!
And that's the last bottle of A-B negative blood we've got.
Nurse!
Bungchow!
Oh, please, bungchow!
Easy.
It's okay now.
No one's gonna hurt you.
Just give No, no, no.
No one's gonna hurt you.
Give me the knife.
Come on.
Give me the knife.
Come on.
-  - Give me a sponge.
- She's hurt!
- Okay, kid, relax.
Just take it easy now.
Just calm down.
Take it easy.
It's all right.
What's all the hoo-ha?
Are you crazy?
You wrecked a $39 dress.
Your people will pay for this.
Father Mulcahy tried to calm the prisoner by yelling "bungchow," thinking it was Chinese for peace and friendship.
Unfortunately, it really means, "Your daughter's pregnancy brings much joy to our village.
" P. W. Surgery completed by Captain Pierce.
Prisoner recaptured by Corporal Max Klinger who sustained loss of personal property.
Please see requisition form S427J-9 requesting replacement of one brassiere brand name, Miss High Rise, 36 B-cup.
I had that kid five, maybe ten minutes away from closing.
- How could you let him grab a knife?
- New experience for me too.
My patients don't grab a knife until after they've seen the bill.
He's going sour on me, you know.
Temperature 102.
Vital signs are lousy the works.
I every confidence in you, Dr. Hackenbush.
Here.
I made you a nice cup of tea.
I don't feel like any.
You make it very hard for a guy to be a Gray Lady.
Chateau Hawkeye, '51.
A very good year.
A cheeky little wine.
They call it the "rascal of the vineyards".
Red or white?
Hash for dinner.
I think red.
I'm bringing this to Erika's.
Just like you to poison an innocent girl.
- How's she doing?
- Oh, she's fine.
Prisoner winged her.
Superficial, but it should be good for a week in Tokyo.
- Accompanied by her personal physician.
- Personal physician.
It figures.
Cutting up a nurse is bad enough.
But why did he have to louse up my patient?
Come on, Trap.
Ease off.
The guy was terrified out of his skull.
I'll tell that to the kid in bed six.
If I ever get him conscious again.
You do your part and I'll do mine.
Attention, Major Houlihan.
Your chest X-rays are ready and they really came out beautiful.
Pierce, what's the big idea saluting me?
We all have our bad days, Frank.
-  - What are you doing?
Can't a guy have a wash and set without somebody biting him on the neck?
- Biting who?
- I was biting you.
- No, you were biting me!
- Klinger, what are you doing in here?
Borrowing your shampoo, Major.
It's wartime.
We all gotta help each other.
No, we don't!
You get out of here, you pervert!
Pervert?
Who bit who, Major?
Out!
Out!
I've had enough of his shenanigans.
I'm going to talk to Henry.
I want that freak out of this outfit and out of the U.S. Army!
Frank, you're so exciting when you get all riled up and decisive.
- I am?
- Would you like to bite the real thing?
Ah.
That's really nice.
- Thanks.
Is this wine?
- Well, you could call it that.
Just keep it away from open flame or living tissue.
- I'm glad you're feeling better.
- Just a bit throbby, that's all.
- In a way, I'm not sorry it happened.
- Come again?
We can always tell our children, "Your mother and I met at a stabbing.
We were introduced by a berserk Chinese Communist.
It was love at first blood".
- What's the prognosis?
- I'm afraid I have bad news for you.
- What?
- You have only ten seconds to kiss me.
Let's listen to the old heart, shall we?
Listen, Lieutenant, I gotta shove off.
- But you just got here.
- Well, there's a lot  - What?
- A lot of sick people.
At ease, everybody.
Sit if you like.
- Burns, you wanted to see me?
- Yes, and it's very important.
- What's the problem, Frank?
- We have a situation that's out of hand.
- Something has to be done.
- I've sent for Corporal Klinger, sir.
- What do I want Klinger for?
- Because it directly concerns him.
- Send for him right away, Radar.
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead, Frank.
- Corp.
Klinger has got to go.
He's a menace to the discipline and morale of this military establishment.
That's a very serious charge.
Get Klinger over here right away.
Yes, sir.
- Colonel - Frank, please try to say something.
Even a gurgling sound would help.
Look, you keep this up and someone's gonna do an autopsy on you.
I've had it with that clown Klinger!
He's degraded all of us for the last time.
Corp.
Klinger reporting, sir.
- Please, sit down.
- Thank you.
At ease.
Okay, he's here.
Let's have it.
What's wrong with Klinger?
"What's wrong with Klinger"?
A soldier stands in your office in an evening gown and you ask what's wrong?
I'll admit, he's no Lana Turner.
I don't usually wear floor-length during the day.
- Oh.
-  Henry?
This moron is bucking for a section 8, and I want you to help him get it.
Bless you, sir.
Section eight is a pretty drastic matter.
Believe me, sir, I am drastic.
Colonel, we can always take it directly to the adjutant general.
Acting on complaint of Majors Burns and Houlihan, Col.
Blake has requested psychiatrist from headquarters to determine if Corp.
Klinger can be discharged under section eight.
Crazy people.
- Did I tell you?
- What?
I told you you'd pull that kid through and you did with your own two heads.
- I guess I'm some kind of a genius.
- You're just too dumb to know it.
Fill her up please, pal.
Everything under the hood is okay.
- I meant to ask you, how's Erika?
- Oh, she's fine.
- But I don't feel good.
She's married.
- Married?
Married, as in "I love you, but you never take me anywhere".
- Married.
It's a very common illness.
- So, what's the problem?
I guess I'll have to junk a few of my fantasies, like walking off with the lieutenant hand-in-hand in the sunset.
Oh.
It's like that.
I thought you were gonna give her one of your dancing lessons without music.
Well, so did I, and then all of a sudden everything changed in mid-lechery.
Hey, look.
How many alternatives do you have?
You can stay in there and keep pitching, or you can back off and start with somebody else.
You know something?
For a man with a slow leak in his head, sometimes you think pretty good.
Trapper, the O.R. Just sent me over.
- Yeah, what is it?
- Your patient.
He's in big trouble.
Did they say what kind of trouble?
Internal bleeding, deep shock, like that.
Great little war we got here, huh?
I can do without it.
19 October.
Number of incoming wounded decreased.
Capt.
Mclntyre's patient critical.
Chinese P. W. Making postop recovery.
Lt.
Erika Johnson recuperating under personal supervision of Capt.
Pierce.
Under personal supervision of Capt.
Pierce.
Request by Col.
Blake for section eight evaluation of Corp.
Max Klinger has been approved.
Maj.
Milton Freedman, divisional medical staff psychiatrist, arrives tomorrow.
- Yeah?
- This way, sir.
He's bucking for psycho, and giving everybody a swift pain in the butt.
The question is, should he have it?
How do you feel about it?
You're the doctor.
Radar.
He's here, sir.
Corp.
Klinger, this is Maj.
Freedman, divisional psychiatrist.
Major, sir.
You got me up here to ask me about him?
About that?
Well, you see, it really wasn't my idea.
All the way from Seoul to ask me what?
Whether he needs a girdle under that?
Whether his seams are straight?
Okay, okay, it's all part of the war, I guess.
I have a few questions to ask you.
Sit down, soldier.
Yes, sir.
Now, what's your name, honey?
Normal.
If you were any more normal, you'd be sick.
What is it?
- Why do I wanna kiss your thermometer?
- Oh, come on.
I never wanted to kiss anybody else's.
Believe me, I could've kissed thousands.
I did my residency in a big general hospital.
Every day I could Hawkeye, what's wrong?
Us, you, me, him.
You name it.
What am I doing?
What am I doing?
Wh-What am I doing?
Whatever it is, I approve.
You're married, madam.
You're a married madam.
Why don't I go away?
- Hawkeye, I am not married.
- Your finger's just turning gold?
That's my grandmother's.
It cuts down on wrestling matches.
- You're not married?
- Never have been.
Move over, Lieutenant.
- Was it really that important?
- Even before I knew if you had teeth.
Don't panic, folks.
It's just the generator again.
- I wanna go order the invitations.
- You're moving a little fast.
No, not really.
We'll take our time, think it over.
Then we'll get married when we're ready, like tomorrow.
It'll be a quiet ceremony.
Just the immediate family and the Eighth Army.
- I have a confession to make.
- What's that?
I never wanted to kiss your thermometer.
Capt.
Pierce, report to O.R. Immediately.
Capt.
Pierce to O.R. On the double.
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.
Don't do anything.
- Don't get married.
- Don't worry.
- So, what's the picture?
- I gotta go back in on the kid in bed 6.
He's got an abscess fever, secondary infection, elevated white count.
- Bingo.
- Yeah.
I tapped a gallon of pus out of him this afternoon.
Didn't do any good.
All on account of that idiot with the knife.
Hey, you wanna hear some good news?
You ready?
Erika's not married.
- Who?
- Erika!
You're working with a terminal bachelor.
- Great.
- How'd you like to be second best man?
You'll have to shave, of course.
All right, come on.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Mclntyre, wait.
What do you mean?
- When?
- A minute ago.
So you're doing okay, huh?
Getting all that juice you need?
Trapper?
Trap?
That's not what we're about.
- Sign it.
You'll have your wish.
- What does it say?
It says I've examined you and found you to be a transvestite and a homosexual.
- You may also have postnasal drip.
- I ain't any of those.
- You ain't Errol Flynn either.
- Where do you come off calling me that?
I think I got the idea from your cleavage.
Now, this will be on your record permanently.
From here on, you go through life on high heels.
- Sign it.
- The hell I will.
I'm just crazy.
All I want is a section eight.
You know what you can do with this.
Hey, soldier.
You forgot your purse.
- Hawkeye?
- Hey, Erika.
Come on in.
Hey.
Ooh, so this is the Swamp.
Famous in song and story.
Haven't changed a thing since Valentino died.
Uh, you shaved this morning, didn't you?
That's right, and I'm gonna shave again later on.
- Little drinky for the memsahib?
- Why not?
From now on, I shave constantly.
Beards are for bachelors.
Uh, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
It's all over camp we're getting married.
Don't you think we oughta talk about it before you start knitting little things?
Be gentle with me.
I've never, uh I've never caught the bouquet before.
Quite honestly, Hawkeye, I have certain very definite doubts about marriage.
Now you tell me, after I shave?
Quiet honestly, it's just not in my plans.
- I thought we had something going here.
- We do, something very strong.
So why superimpose marriage on it?
Well, it's been known to work.
- Mom was married.
Dad was married.
- My parents were married too.
Everybody I know is.
It's the world's It's just not my favorite institution.
##  Just what I needed their song.
Be honest, Hawk.
Don't you think you're wanting to get married is kind of a war thing?
No.
I'd love you in war and peace.
Or Moby Dick.
Any of the classics.
Well, the boot is finally on the other foot.
You know how many times I've told women there may not be any tomorrow?
There may not be.
I've got orders for Tokyo.
- I'll be leaving in the morning.
- No kidding.
No kidding.
Well, if we can't have the marriage, how about a very short, intense engagement?
Would you sign this, please, sir?
Just exactly what am I signing?
This week's activity and personnel report.
- Didn't I sign it?
- That was last week.
- Oh.
Is it now already?
- Yes, sir.
Here, sir.
- Can I read it?
- Yes, sir.
You never let me read anything I'm signing.
Sometimes I get the feeling you're trying to hide the war from me, Radar.
- No, sir, no.
- I'll be the judge of what's here.
"Chinese Communist prisoner berserk in O.R. "Wounds Lt.
Erika Johnson and contaminated one surgical case.
- Right, sir.
"Psycho examination  Corporal Klinger".
Did you see that number Klinger was wearing in the mess tent this morning?
- The tight little green satin job?
- I must have missed it.
Whew.
It was a head snapper.
Okay.
"Lt.
Johnson reassigned, Tokyo.
"Dr. Mclntyre lost patient due to complications in O.R. Incident.
Yes, sir.
Wounded Chinese prisoner recovering".
- Well, every week can't be exciting.
- No, sir.
Okay.
There may be a golf ball in your office.
- I'll try and find it.
- Thank you.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Adjust the drip on that I. V.  Nurse, when you get a chance, come here.
- Get me a bottle of O-positive blood.
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, okay, suture scissors.
- Scissors.
- Four-oh silk.
- Four-oh silk.
- Beautiful stitching, Frank.
- Thanks.
You used to do baseball gloves, right?
Just ignore him, Frank.
Got enough shrapnel here to make a nine iron.
That's 12 fragments so far.
This guy's a walking junkyard too.
Hey, are all these people Koreans?
Now that you mention it If you'd read the surgery schedule, you'd know they were.
The village ofTai-Dong was shelled this morning.
Well, they were probably asking for it washing their babies, having breakfast, committing other acts of aggression.
Hey, I was in Tai-Dong last week.
Forceps.
There's no enemy artillery anywhere near that place.
I insist on quiet in here!
Will someone please turn the war down for Frank?
Hey, Trap.
Look at this.
Here we are, and here's the village of Tai-Dong, about eight kilometers south - Henry?
- Eight kilometers south of us.
I'm listening.
- You mind looking at Korea?
- Every single morning.
You know, I've been here all these months, and sometimes I still wake up and wonder, "What has my wife done to the bedroom"?
Henry, this morning the village ofTai-Dong was shelled, and the only artillery unit anywhere near it was the 348th.
Which of them are they?
It is not "they" and it is not "them".
It is "us".
The good guys.
We clobbered 'em.
- Oops!
- At least.
You wanna dig out the "oops" forms and tell the whole class about it?
- Radar - Sir?
Instant corporal.
- You wanna get me the forms - Pierce, hold it.
Look, this is a very serious charge.
You've got to have some proof.
Let's not go off half-cocked.
Well, then let's go off all-cocked, but let's go off.
- Get me the forms, will you?
- What forms am I getting?
- The ones he wants.
- Oh, that Tai-Dong thing.
Hey.
Just what we thought.
I checked with a guy in Artillery.
These fragments are as American as apple pie and napalm.
Uh, what was that about proof, Henry?
I just want to remind you how thrilled the army is about people who rock the boat.
Women and colonels first, Henry.
Anyway, were not in the army.
That is, were in the army, but we're not "Army".
Little "A" as opposed to big "A".
Uh-huh.
Well, you file that report, and the army's gonna put your big "A" and your little "A" in a sling.
- Radar, if you want me, I won't be anywhere.
- Yes, sir.
- Hawkeye?
Here you go.
- Is that everything?
You got all the forms?
There's enough red tape in there to keep anybody happy.
We want the army to take responsibility for the shelling.
And full compensation for the village.
- Are you guys making this report together?
- Why not?
Then afterwards, hand-in-hand, we're jumping off Lovers' Leap.
Boy, you sure got guts, sirs.
If we don't, we know where to get 'em.
We're doctors.
Well, I mean, you're the first officers I ever saw who would stick by their principles no matter what.
Except for that colonel who reported the P.X. Kickbacks.
- What colonel?
- You know.
PrivateJohnson?
Attention, all personnel.
Due to circumstances beyond our control, lunch will be served today.
Before we get to work on these, how about a wee drop of the creature?
I'm driving, so I'll just have a double.
- This a new batch?
- The newest.
- Dry enough for you?
- Is what dry enough?
I'm trying a new filter system: Charcoal and sweat socks.
Okay, let's see here.
"Type of engagement: Air strike, armored attack, artillery, atomic".
- Nice, huh?
Multiple choice disasters.
- Listen to this.
"In completing attached form 2759, stroke 6-J-12, delete printed reference to World War II and substitute 'Korean Police Action".
' This is surplus.
The least they could do is give our war its own stationery.
- Well, what have we gotta do here?
-  Well, I see the bar is open again, hmm?
Pigpen.
Brothel.
- Here, sir.
- Yo!
- Where's my razor?
- Shaving your legs again, Frank?
I don't think it's so all-fired sophisticated to walk around with a beard.
You ought to try it sometime, Frank.
Women love it.
- Oh, I'll bet.
- Really.
Come here.
Kiss me.
- Caught you!
- At what?
Making one of your obscene gestures behind my back.
- Which one?
- You know, the one that Frank.
- Truce, okay?
Truce?
- Hah!
Last time we had a truce, I found peanut butter in my stethoscope.
Frank, we're gonna submit a report to Seoul about the shelling ofTai-Dong.
We were the three surgeons on duty, Frank.
We all should sign it.
Are you guys loony?
I'm not getting involved.
I'm not signing anything.
And I never knock any team I'm on.
Frank, I'm sorry, all right?
- For what?
- Everything.
All of it.
The The peanut butter in your stethoscope.
- The ether in your aftershave.
- And autographing my mother's picture?
"Dear Frank, Dad was not your father.
- Love, Mom".
- We'll give you a blanket "sorry".
- Just sign this for old times' sake.
- For new times' sake.
I'm not making any waves.
Mm-mm.
Frank, come on, listen.
You can't turn your back on those people.
- You operated on some of them.
- I don't remember operating on anyone.
Oh, really?
What about all this iron confetti you're saving for a souvenir?
Oh, give me those fragments!
You guys are not gonna get me in Dutch!
Frank, one decent act.
If you don't like it, you don't have to do it again.
Oh, go fish!
Attention.
P.F.C. Lester Pasco will pay five dollars for a hot letter from home.
-  Colonel Blake?
- I don't start till 9:00.
Leave your name with my service.
Sir, this is your service.
There's someone important here to see you.
- How do you know?
- He has a briefcase.
Come in.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Sir, I'll take this stuff back to the laundry that made this terrible mistake.
- Thank you.
- Colonel, this is Major Stoner, adjutant inspector general.
Oh, my.
This is somewhat of a frightening honor.
I'm here because our office received a form 2759, stroke 6-J-12.
Oh, I can well imagine.
- Look, why don't you just sit down here, Major?
- Thank you.
Make yourself down there.
Uh, just exactly what is a 2759, stroke whatever?
I know it's too big for a shoe size.
This 2759 is what?
It's a request for an investigation filed by two of your surgeons.
Uh, Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce?
Hawkeye.
Captain John Mclntyre?
Trapper.
- Colonel?
- Hmm?
Uh, this matter is highly classified.
- Classified?
- Not for everyone's ears?
Oh.
Sure.
Well, the corporal's been thoroughly cleared.
I did it myself.
I beg your pardon?
Radar, didn't you fill out those top secret forms on yourself?
- Yes, sir.
- And didn't I sign where you told me to?
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Well, there you go.
Clear as mother's milk.
Uh, are you clear, Colonel?
Uh, well, didn't we clear each other?
- Corporal?
- Yes, sir?
- Try "ma'am" once!
- Yes, ma'am.
Sorry.
- Where's Colonel Blake?
- He went off with Major Stoner.
- Major Stoner?
- Yes, sir.
- You stand up when you address an officer!
- Yes, sir!
Now, do I know anything about this Major Stoner?
I don't know that you know anything at all, sir.
Where is Major Stoner?
- He's gone off with Colonel Blake.
- I wonder where he's from.
- Bloomington, Illinois.
- What?
The colonel's from Bloomington.
It's a town.
I'm from Iowa myself, which is quite a coincidence when you think about it.
Where the Major is from.
Oh, he's from the inspector general's office.
Tai-Dong.
Let's go.
You will continue to stand till I leave your sight!
- It'll be a pleasure, ma'am.
- Sir!
Uh, yes, sir, ma'am.
Change the dressing, Ginger, and then she can go back to whatever's left of her home.
- Orders on the other two?
- Yeah, discontinue I.V., start 'em on clear liquids.
Ah.
Pierce?
Uh, Pierce, this is Major Stoner, inspector general's office.
- Oh.
How are you?
- Captain, I'm here about your request.
- An investigation of the alleged shelling at Tai-Dong.
- Alleged?
- Pierce.
- These patients look alleged to you?
- This woman was almost alleged to death.
- Oh, now, Captain, hold it.
Oh!
Oh, one of those "hold it" fellas, huh?
I'm going ahead with this.
I don't care how much you threaten me.
You never threatened him, Major.
Pierce, don't start that "threatening" talk.
I'm warning you!
Captain, I'm here to get this investigation rolling, and I'm counting on your cooperation.
I should tell you I admire the courage it took to report this incident.
Antipersonnel fragments.
Ours.
Full set of X rays.
Complete medical profiles on all the victims.
- Complete.
- Gentlemen, this is a hospital.
Well, these shrapnel fragments should be the clincher.
There could even be a commendation in it for you, Pierce.
Oh, no, just a simple honorable discharge and, say, 50,000 a year, tax free.
- But that's negotiable.
- Colonel Blake?
Oh, Major Houlihan, Major Stoner.
- Major.
- Major.
Major, Major Burns, Major Stoner.
- Major.
- Major.
- Major Pierce.
- Major.
Well, I think we've made a major breakthrough here.
I was on duty that day with Pierce and Mclntyre.
I was ranking surgeon.
Then you should have filed the report.
He was involved with a case.
It takes a long time to filet a patient.
Where do I sign?
The report's already been processed.
Needless to say, this is very sensitive material.
Top secret.
Total silence must be observed.
Understood, Colonel?
Oh, uh, cross my heart.
And, uh, Pierce, you'll be hearing from us.
- Good enough.
- Shall we?
Why didn't you let him sign?
Let him?
We begged him to.
We begged him to do the decent thing.
- Frank?
- Well, how do I know what the decent thing is?
Clever, the way the cook sculpts grease into the shape of lamb chops.
- What are we eating?
- Don't ask me.
I only had a year of postmortem.
- Can I get a few details from you?
- About that?
The Tai-Dong business.
I'm filing my own report on the number of wounded and mutilated.
I feel the more, the merrier, don't you?
- Has a nice Genghis Khan feeling.
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.
Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.
- Now, I send this right to Stoner, right?
- If you can reach him.
A week and a half, he hasn't come to the phone.
That's a long time to spend in the bathroom.
Well, he is an officer.
Hey, we made the papers.
"Tai-Dong shelled.
"The army revealed that the South Korean village ofTai-Dong "sustained damage and casualties as a result of enemy artillery attack".
Enemy artillery?
Any questions?
Well, I'm certainly glad the army straightened that out.
Now we know how Dreyfus felt when he read his story in Stars and Stripes.
Uh, Major Stoner?
Yes.
This is the 4077 th MASH calling.
Hold on for Colonel Henry Blake.
You're on.
-  Colonel, how are you?
- Not too good, actually.
I just read your story in Stars and Stripes and my bellybutton fell out.
Who is this?
Captain Pierce?
No.
Sucker Pierce and his sidekick, Huckleberry Dumbbell.
Oh, well, look, Captain, I just got back from Okinawa, and the first thing that hit me was that copy of Stars and Stripes.
- Frankly, I was shocked.
- I would think you would be.
Well, look, Pierce, I promise you, heads will roll.
I'm going to the top on this one.
You'll get your satisfaction.
The people ofTai-Dong will be taken care of.
- You have my word.
- Okay, Major.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Nu?
The Major happens to be the Korean distributor for crapola.
Gentlemen, I believe the ball is in our court.
##  "Dear Dad, "you always said Senator Baxter was good for a favor "because of all your work in the primaries.
"Well, I got a favor that needs doing.
There's a little village over here called Tai-Dong or at least there was".
- Want to play sardines tonight?
- Sardines?
My tent.
I'll bring the oil.
- Hawkeye, can I see you for a second?
- One second.
What's up, Radar?
Well, I have this problem.
Radar, Radar, we give you these lectures, show you these training films.
No, no, come on, listen, I'm seri Uh, if a certain M.D. Doctor around here sent off a certain letter to a certain male parent, not his mother, to get in touch with a certain senator about a certain favor, he shouldn't be too certain that that letter didn't end up in a certain whole other place.
I didn't do it!
Your mail's being stopped at Division H.Q.!
That letter was between me and my father, damn it!
Hey!
I just got her!
- Now I've gotta glue the arm.
- Ah, glue you, Henry!
Whatever happened to personal liberty around here?
Why am I bothering to ask?
Maybe I better go to Seoul and tell this to the papers.
Or to Edward R. Murrow, if he's in town.
- Pierce.
- What is it?
What?
- I wouldn't try to leave camp.
- What, I'm under arrest?
I didn't say that.
You're restricted.
- That means I'm under arrest.
- Not at all.
You're only restricted up to the point where you're uh, where you're, uh You're under arrest.
Henry, what's happened to you?
You sneak off behind our backs and enlist?
- You regular army now?
- Sit down, Pierce!
That's an order!
- You're forcing me to stand.
- Please sit down!
- That's an order I can take.
- Now, just hold your bladder, Pierce.
This poop sheet's just come in from General Clayton's office down in Seoul.
The army has started rebuilding Tai-Dong.
It's gonna be better than it ever was.
All-new housing, a temple, a town hall with inside toilets, a shopping center and they're getting the first soft ice cream stand in all of East Asia.
- Well?
- That's terrific.
I'm glad.
Now what about rebuilding the truth?
The what?
This is compensation.
Where's their admission of responsibility?
Well, soft ice cream is a pretty good admission!
- Who are you calling?
- I'm going over your fly to General Clayton.
- Radar?
- Wait.
What do you want to call the general for?
- You've got one out of two.
You're batting.
500!
- Radar!
The general's on his way here, Hawkeye.
I begged you not to call the general!
Now he's on his way!
- You broke the other arm.
- And I broke the other arm!
I broke Here's the glue, sir.
You can't get arms.
Ah, Pierce, Mclntyre.
Nice to see you taking it easy.
- No wounded, huh?
- Except for us.
That sense of humor.
Disgusting!
Look at them, sucking up to the general.
- Henry.
- General.
Say, how would you, just to get it started, like a little refreshment?
You want to slip into your barbecue apron, Henry?
No, I mean a drink.
How would you like a drink?
- You know, as an icebreaker?
- I don't think that'll be necessary.
Well, I don't either.
It was just a thought.
What'll you have?
- My usual.
- Comin' up.
One sherry and ginger ale.
All right, men.
Let's talk Tai-Dong.
We get the impression that your people have been pouring manure on this whole thing in the hope that something beautiful will grow.
Oh, Pierce, I don't think you should say "manure" to the general.
- If the shoe fits - Well, there is that.
- We've been getting double-talk in triplicate.
- Unanswered calls.
I've seen the plans for the rebuilding, General.
- Censored mail.
- Inside toilets, soft ice cream.
Makes you feel the whole war is worthwhile.
- Hope that's okay.
Little more ginger ale?
- Mmm.
Look, that's fine.
Just bring the check.
We're doing everything we can for these people.
We've awarded a contractor a $6 million rebuilding deal.
Oh, that's a fair price for a $2 million job.
- About $100,000 per head we knocked off.
- Now, hold it, fella.
The other guy did that.
It was a North Korean attack.
It was in all the papers.
Look, General, we operated on a lot of those casualties.
We got X rays, medical records.
We even got shrapnel fragments.
- You've got 'em all.
- We gave them to Major Stoner.
Stoner?
Stoner?
Oh, yes, yes, uh He's doing a bang-up job for COMSERVPAC in Honolulu.
Uh-oh.
Put all your fragments in your COMSERVPAC and smile, smile, smile.
Look, boys, a little fatherly advice, huh?
You're not regular army.
You think you're gonna leave here and pick up your civilian practice and that's that.
Listen, everything they put on your record like "agitator," "boat-rocker" is gonna follow you.
The army's got mighty long arms.
- Oh, come on.
- Let me finish, Captain.
I was just gonna suggest that.
You find your work here difficult, distasteful.
But you are back here, behind the lines.
It's relatively calm.
Oh, definitely.
I was thinking of building a house here after the war.
You could easily find yourself assigned to a first-aid station, right where it's happening.
You serious?
I'm getting pressure from above.
Now, look, let's play ball, huh?
For the good of the outfit.
You don't wanna give the Red, White and Blue a black eye, do you?
Boy, that gets ya right where ya live, sir.
I've got to hand it to you, General.
You buried the evidence, you got rid of the guy who knew the evidence, and now if we press this, you'll take away our breathing privileges.
- Well done, General.
- Take another star out of petty cash.
- General Clayton, we'd like to see you, sir.
- Not now, ladies.
- I've got a stake in this, and I won't be left out.
- Fair is fair.
- Major Burns was on duty that day.
- Indeed, I was.
I pulled American shrapnel out of those poor villagers myself.
- Luckily, he saved some of the fragments.
- Under my pillow.
The fragment fairy will reward you.
Go on, Frank.
Uh, no need to.
This matter is closed.
They're getting a brand-new temple.
It's never even been prayed in.
I also have these X rays and completely documented medical records.
- Go, Frank, go.
- Now, commendation never entered my mind when I decided to report this terrible but very human mistake made by a few of our own brutal but well-meaning fighting men.
The signed affidavits are by Major Burns and by myself, who was also there.
This requires a little rethink and reevaluation.
We re-agree with you, General.
- Henry, get me a driver.
- Certainly.
The general's driver's waiting, sir.
Hell, even the army has to take its lumps.
I guess this is one of those times.
- Sir, um - We'll send this to you after we read our story in Stars and Stripes.
- Page one this time.
- Not back on page 14 under pro station addresses.
All right, I'll tell you what.
You write it up, I'll get it printed.
Your gun, sir.
Oh, you forgot your driver!
- Are they something?
- I love 'em.
Take her.
He's mine.
- Stop it!
Frank!
Frank!
- You leave her alone!
- You leave me alone!
- You know you love it!
Pierce, you are a degenerate person!
Uh, Hawkeye?
Hawkeye, you busy?
Just changing a tire.
What is it?
Uh, this letter came special delivery.
I thought it might be important.
- With your luck, you've been drafted.
- Hold this, Nurse.
Hold your own nurse.
I'm busy.
Read the letter.
I'm gonna close the peritoneum.
Give me three-oh chromi G.I. - Are you ready?
- Yeah.
Uh, "May 24, 1951.
Dear Son" - It's from your father.
- Good guess.
Uh, "I'm afraid Senator Baxter can't be of much help to you.
"It seems he was just indicted for influence peddling and faces 20 years in the pokey".
Uh, there's more.
"Sure makes me sorry I stuffed the ballot box for him.
Love, Dad".
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Hey, Charlie.
Let's get these walls cleaned up They look like they need it.
Attention.
No wounded are expected for 24 hours.
Surgical personnel are now on conditional stand-down.
- What are you doin'?
- Somebody took my patient.
You finished him!
Well, where's the next one?
Let's go!
Deal me another case!
I got a winning streak here.
Come on.
Give me a gown!
Hey, pal, that's it.
We're all done.
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Attention.
At 1300 hours, Colonel Blake will lecture on the dangers of acne in combat.
I never wanted to get to bed so bad in my whole life.
Wait a second.
I take that back.
There was a nurse in med school.
When I put my ear to her navel, I could hear the ocean.
- Some night.
- Before that, it was some day.
- And before that, it was some night.
- Well, you kept taking all the chest cases like you were their only hope.
Oh, you're right.
I keep forgetting what wonders Mercurochrome can do.
Let's hit the sack.
Hello, bed.
This is Captain Pierce.
Can you hear me?
I'm coming in, bed.
Morpheus, don't just stand there, I'm yours.
What's that?
What's that I hear?
Thunder?
Thunder.
Must be thunder.
Avalanche.
They get 'em here in the mountains all the time.
You go to sleep.
I'll put a hold on your rocks till morning.
Hey, you've been carving for 20 straight hours.
Even Albert Schweitzer takes a rest.
You've gone through three shifts of nurses.
Really?
And I'm still hungry.
- Sir?
- Can't sit down.
We got new wounded.
Well, sir, should I send back those 1941 frozen surplus chicken wings we got?
I wouldn't.
They're a lot better than those 1939 surplus hamburger patties.
Come on.
Get smart.
Don't look.
Don't tempt yourself.
Don't worry about me, pal.
I just wanna see what I'll be missing.
- Help me sleep better.
- Pierce, get some sack.
Yeah, I just wanna look.
I won't buy anything.
- Watch it.
- Look out.
That kid's got chest wounds.
I can spot it a mile off.
Terrific.
Your eyes are perfect.
Thanks.
Yours are cute too.
One on each side of your nose, but we can fix that.
- Yeah.
- Go to bed.
Who's gonna put that kid with the surprised look back together?
You?
You don't know your rectus abdominus from your gluteus maximus.
If I find something in his chest I don't recognize, I'll come and get you, okay?
Pierce, you're asleep on your feet.
Wake me when I'm finished.
I don't wanna miss my nap.
Doctor, do you want me to hold that for you?
Put a clamp on that.
Hold it till I get in there.
Okay, cut that.
- Henry.
- Yeah.
- What's he doing in here?
- Gee, I don't know, Frank.
He's a doctor.
Maybe somebody's sick.
I've been asleep three times while he's gone on operating.
- You know what that means?
- Yeah, you're Sleepy.
And I always thought you were Dopey.
You're certainly not Doc.
- Sponge.
-  What that means, Colonel, is that this man is probably operating below par.
Nonsense.
I've already had six holes in one.
Get it?
"Six holes in one"?
Little gallows humor to relieve the tremendous pressure.
- I must have your body.
-  And you're off both shifts.
I don't wanna see you with a knife in your hand for 48 hours.
Taxi!
- Take him home.
- Move it, driver.
There's an extra five in it for you if you get me there fast.
What country is this, sirrah?
Do they sleep here?
Hark!
A herd of nurse.
Or is that gaggle?
No, that's geese.
Although, goose and nurse don't go together.
- On the other hand - I think I better get you to bed.
A noble idea.
Any takers?
Anybody wanna come to my tent for a drink?
We could talk a little doctor.
Or perhaps play some.
Last chance, ladies.
How do you whistle?
It has something to do with the lips, doesn't it?
We had a preacher back home who whistled while he preached.
I hope he was run out of town, the filthy hypocrite.
Okay now, let me get you to bed here - and make sure you're comfortable.
- That's what they all say.
- Uh-oh.
- What?
What do you hear?
- Slowly I turn, - Hawkeye.
- Step by step, inch by inch.
- Hawk.
Hawk.
Listen.
Let somebody else do these.
You're tired.
Radar, you're not a doctor.
You're a layman, if I may use that term so early in the morning.
The human body aside from its other wonders has glands known as the adrenals.
Even as I talk to you, a tiny little man inside me with a golf cap and a pink cashmere sweater is saying to my adrenals, "Okay, fill 'er up.
My oil and water are all right".
- Really?
- Of course, in some people the overproduction of adrenalin can lead to compulsive, even psychotic behavior.
Why are you staring at me like that?
- I'm not staring at you.
- It must just be your eyes.
- What is it?
- Wake up.
I thought you were asleep.
Something funny is happening here, and I'm finally beginning to notice it.
For the past couple of days, I've been making some very careful observations.
There's a war going on here.
People walkin' around with guns.
Uniforms.
Dozens of bodies coming in by helicopter.
And without exception, every single one of them is mangled in some way.
Don't you see?
It all adds up.
There's guns, uniforms, wounded bodies.
- You figured that out, huh?
- I'm beginning to see a pattern.
Why don't you go to sleep?
You're turning into a 170-pound fruitcake.
If I thought I could stop it just by going to sleep, don't you think I'd try?
Look.
Close your bulbs and it all goes away.
Two or three hours later, it'll be tomorrow.
And if that gets unbearable, you check out again.
See how it works.
Somebody and it wasn't you or me started this war.
Now who was it?
What, did two guys slap each other with gloves and challenge themselves?
It isn't Pearl Harbor.
We already had one of those.
L-I gotta find out who started it.
And then what?
And then I'll get 'em to call it off.
Hi, Hawkeye.
Get some sleep?
- No, thanks.
Not while I'm standing.
- Okay.
As long as you're pretending to be Thomas Edison as a boy, send a telegram.
Oh, sure.
Hold on a second.
Oh, hey what does, uh, "holacast" mean?
Nothing.
Not a thing.
But we have a similar word in English which may interest you"holocaust".
- Yeah?
What's that mean?
- An immense conflagration.
- Yeah?
- A big fire.
What are you reading?
"Captain Marvel and His Formfitting Underpants"?
Oh, no.
I'm just catching up on my history.
- Oh, war comics, huh?
- Yeah.
I knew I shoulda waited for the book.
Oh, World War II.
Lotta nice songs came out of that war.
# I'll be home for Christmas # #You can count on me # You know that song?
Uh, no, I guess that was a little before my time.
I remember lying on the rug, listening to them sing that on the radio.
I can still smell the rug.
# Please have snow # #And mistletoe # #And presents # # On the tree ## A lot of very touching songs came out of that war.
#When the fuhrer says we is the master race # #We heil, phtt, heil # # Right in the fuhrer's face ## Oh, right.
I guess you want to send that telegram now.
My very thought, Mercury.
Not a minute to lose.
- Okay, shoot.
- To Harry S. Truman, the White House.
And copy the Secretary General of the United Nations.
Uh, uh, Dear Harry, Who's responsible?
Sign that: Affectionately, a dissatisfied customer.
Wow.
- Come on!
Let's go, send it!
- All right.
Let me know the minute you get an answer.
Hey, Doc.
How they honkin'?
I've been looking for you.
Don't go up in your helicopter anymore.
- It's not your fault.
- Huh?
You just don't understand the relationship, probably.
When you go up in the air, all your stretchers are empty, right?
- Sure.
- Yeah, but see, when you come back, there's always a kid, or a portion of him in one of the stretchers, right?
Well, I can't let you do that anymore.
Nobody goes up, nobody gets hurt.
That's very interesting, Doc.
Okay, sure, Doc.
You won't be out of a job.
We can turn your chopper into a flying saloon or a house of ill repute in the sky.
Okay, that's done.
Now I can - get some sleep.
-  I need a 50cc syringe with a 15 needle.
Get him inside right away.
He's got a tension pneumothorax.
We get the air out of his chest, we can save the lung.
Start the I.V. With whole blood, stat!
That's good.
Put it right here.
Listen, Pierce.
You were ordered to stand down.
I did, but I fell up again.
Oh, let me see.
Uh, the Lone Ranger.
Very good.
You've gone against orders, Pierce.
Somebody else could have operated.
I asked the kid to sit in the waiting room, but he's read all our magazines.
I'm gonna be frank with you, Pierce.
- You're gonna be frank with me?
- I mean blunt.
Oh, that's good.
Otherwise, Frank would try to be Henry with me.
I don't think I could stand that.
Now you pay close attention.
Can you understand what I'm saying?
Why?
Is there something wrong with your mouth?
No, I'm fine.
The problem is you've been on 24-hour call three nights this week.
Three times twenty-four.
Look, Doctor.
No matter what comes in, I'm putting you to bed.
You're the second person to make me that offer.
I must be obvious or something.
Sorry, Henry.
I have to disappoint you.
I just gotta get some sleep.
A message from General Clayton, sir.
He's madder than hell, and he's comin' down here to find out who did it.
- Well, you can hardly blame him.
- Yes, sir.
Coming down here to find out who did what?
Someone sent a telegram to President Truman, sir.
A telegram?
To President Harry S. Truman?
- That president?
- Yes, sir, that's the one.
- Was it dirty?
- Oh, no, sir.
All it It just said, "Who's responsible"?
Oh.
For what?
I don't know, sir.
That's what the general wants to find out.
Well, then he'd better get down here right away.
- Yes, sir, and he's on his way.
- Good thinkin'.
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh.
Better get that garter belt and that other stuff out of my tent.
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, and, uh, do we have enough sherry and ginger ale for the general?
- Oh, nobody does, sir.
- Well, fine.
Then, if nobody does, we don't have to.
But make sure we do, in case we don't.
Don't you believe in knocking?
No.
If I can't say something nice about somebody - What do you want?
- Sorry to bother you, Major.
There's something of major importance I have to discuss with the major.
- Where's Frank?
- You mean Major Burns?
You sure he's not in here sniffing your dress shields or something?
Major Burns is in the mess tent.
You know he gives an orientation lecture every Friday afternoon.
Why, then, are we here?
A very good question.
Let me try to answer that question with an answer.
The American presence is present in Korea at the request of the United Nations.
We're here to keep the peace, to keep the enemy back behind the 38th parallel where they came from, or else, they'll spread south, down Korea, turn left, and the next thing we know, they'll be marching down Main Street, U.S.A. There's a great deal I could tell you about this, men, but, uh, the essence of good teaching is to answer questions uppermost in your mind.
Now, just ask anything at all.
Whatever is most uppermost in your minds.
Anyone?
Anyone at all.
Anyone who has a question on the topic at hand?
Any of the enlisted men who is required to be here that has a question.
Aw, come on, Frank.
I got a question.
- Captain Pierce!
- Why are we here?
I believe I just explained that, Captain.
No, I mean, what what's the war about?
Why What did How did it start?
The Communists, Pierce.
And don't try to make fun of this.
This is serious business.
I'm not making fun, Frank.
I'm trying to figure this out.
What Why should North Korea wanna take over America?
Is it something we said?
Something we didn't say?
Let me tell you something, Pierce.
These godless Communists have run their own countries right into the ground, while we've been building the highest standard of living in the world.
Half of these people over here never even saw a bathroom.
And believe you me, they want one.
- They do?
- You bet your life they do.
And if they can't get our bathrooms by subversion, they'll get them by war!
They can have mine.
I'd be glad to keep my legs crossed until after the war.
That was just a figure of speech.
I can't take your picture now, Radar.
Come back later and we'll get a pony and do it right.
Uh, I've been looking all over for you.
You can even ride the pony when we're finished.
Stick around.
I do beautiful work.
I like that.
It sells.
Pierce, I want you to know you ruined my lecture!
It was a disgraceful thing to do.
You're taking a picture of a latrine?
Very observant, Frank.
What am I doing now?
- What are you doing?
- Still taking a picture of a latrine.
It was a trick question.
- He's absolutely blabbering.
- Psst.
May one ask why you are taking a picture of a latrine?
Why is North Korea shooting at us?
What do we have that they could possibly want?
We have guns, they have guns.
We have tanks, they have tanks.
You gave me the clue, Frank.
This war will go down in history as the Battle of the Bathroom.
He's joking.
I'm sending these pictures to the North with an offer and my personal word that we'll stop if they'll stop.
- Somebody oughta put him to bed.
- You too?
What is this strange power I have that makes people want to get me to bed?
Pierce, return to your tent and get some sleep.
That was a direct order I gave you, Pierce.
Well, he was close.
He's out on my feet.
We gotta do something about Hawkeye, Henry.
He's acting more and more like a like a noodle.
I have my own rear end to worry about.
General Clayton's due here any minute.
Some dodo's been sending telegrams to the president from this camp.
Uh, sir, I can identify the dodo.
- It was Captain Pierce.
- How do you know?
- Uh, I sent it.
- Why didn't you tell me?
I was only trying to help.
I didn't want him to get into trouble.
Oh, you don't care about me getting in trouble.
You don't need any help.
While we're on the subject of trouble, Henry, I think you should know Hawkeye is planning to send the officers' latrine to North Korea.
- Well, that's very friendly.
- Friendly, sir?
Yeah, it's a nice gesture.
But if we send them our latrine, what are we gonna do for one?
You can carry friendship, not to mention latrines, a bit far.
What about the general, sir?
He must have his own latrine.
A one-star general, surely he's got Henry, Hawkeye's gotta be sedated.
Well, then put him away.
Bomb him!
You guys are really gonna help me?
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah, we want the war over too, Hawk.
Let others sit idly by, huh?
As my grandfather Sparky Pierce used to say, "There are some who do, and some who don't.
" He was doing six months in the New Hampshire License Plate Academy when he said it.
Oh, 3:00 was a very good hour.
- Should we drink to your plan?
- To peace.
To peace and the American way of plumbing.
Gentlemen, it's time to bring tranquility to this troubled peninsula.
- When's he gonna fall down?
- I don't know.
Rasputin swallowed a whole drugstore and didn't even belch.
Now wait right here, son.
I'll only be a minute.
Ooh!
Ah!
Ooh!
Ah!
Uh, sir?
Sir!
- Sir, don't go in there, General.
- Out of my way, soldier.
Or I'll have you court-martialed for interfering with an officer's bodily functions.
Uh Uh Uh Hawkeye!
Don't!
Don't!
Uh - Hawkeye, don't!
-  Sergeant!
Get me outta here!
Do you know who I am?
Let me outta here!
Wait a minute!
Where are we going?
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
Well, he drove about 500 yards, then the stuff hit him and he lost altitude.
That's your cuckoo stunts.
- Four on the five.
- Oh, yeah.
Taking a general for a ride to North Korea in a latrine.
Mclntyre, what makes him do these things?
He's just unstable.
He took this weird oath as a young man never to just stand around and watch people die.
I took the same oath, pal.
I didn't ask to be here.
Yeah, me neither.
I guess that makes about 80,000 of us.
You know what?
If we had any guts, you, me and the Masked Marvel there would take the next latrine out of here and go home.
Put the queen on the king.
The queen on the king.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Give me a Kocher.
Vascular clamp.
- Which sister was better?
- The younger one had more experience.
Oh, nertz.
I dropped that fragment again.
You'll get it, Doctor.
- Try a magnet, Frank.
- Or a patient with bigger fragments.
Steady, people.
Metzenbaum scissors.
- Metz.
- We're here to help each other.
Want a hand, Frank?
Aw, leave him alone.
He's just doing a premature autopsy.
- You close.
It's your turn.
- It's not my turn, but I'll do it.
Skin sutures.
Pickups.
Oh, no, not another one.
- What do you got?
- He can't be more than five years old.
I've got a five-year-old back home.
Well, don't send her to camp in Korea.
I'll need a gown and gloves.
Look at that.
Our fearless leader.
Asleep or comatose from the food?
Exhausted.
Thirty hours in O.R. That'll keep the tourists away.
Good night, sweet prince.
You mind if we play through?
Thank you.
How many in your party?
Now, that's a pregnancy craving if I ever saw one.
You can tell us, Radar.
Which girl was it?
- Somebody ought to do something.
- Call Graves Registration.
I notice those guys don't eat here.
He could ruin the garbage disposal industry.
Great wrist action.
Hey, we'll take our check now, miss.
Sorry.
It's not my table.
Hey, you know anything about that boy we operated on?
Just another wounded kid, I guess.
How's he doing?
Okay.
We took a little shrapnel out of his side.
Superficial.
He'll be up and around, two or three days.
Anybody know anything about his family?
If my two girls were missing, I'd be out of my head.
Maybe his folks are missing too.
Well, let's check up on it.
Call Seoul, the Red Cross or the M.P.'s.
Try the local villages around here.
You never know.
- Okay.
Soon as I finish eating lunch.
- That could be in two weeks.
Or three, if he has dessert.
Look, I'm eating as fast as I can.
You do this fast, and you'll find a little something in your pencil box.
A teeny, tiny little nurse all your own.
Honestly, you guys are embarrassing!
Just imagine if he made love as good as he eats.
No woman in the world would be safe.
Scalpel.
"Margo smiled at me, and a chorus of 500 angels sang "'You Made Me Love You, I Didn't Wanna Do It' the Cole Porter arrangement.
"And then she came close, and I could smell her perfume.
"It made me want to leave my wife and children, and I'm not even married.
"'Hi, gorgeous, 'I said.
Then somebody hit me with a piano and the floor came up and smothered me".
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard.
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Reading smut to a child.
- That's terrible!
- This isn't smut.
It's a perfectly good little story about life in everyday America.
Anyway, the kid can't understand English.
That's the Bad Fairy and she's the Wicked Witch.
Oh, yeah, Margo just came into the room.
- You're disturbing the other patients.
- You guys want me to stop?
- No!
- No!
Step down.
Next case.
- Okay, now - How's he doing?
He was doin' great until the house mother and Dr. Clean-cut got here.
You should hear what he's reading to this child.
Perfectly acceptable smut.
Don't pay any attention to them.
See what Uncle Trapper brought you?
Huh?
Some nice anchovy paste and a bottle of pickled onions.
I forbid you to give him those things!
No booze?
A bubble and opium pipe?
Well, this stuff is all right for him.
- Did you hear me, Mclntyre?
- Take a walk, Major.
- Take a major walk.
- Somebody has to protect this child.
- And that's you?
- I am a woman.
- Is that true, Frank?
- I always like a second opinion.
We don't need any of your smart-aleck remarks.
Oh, horsefeathers to you.
I'm ordering you two degenerates to leave this child alone!
Frank, how would you like your lip to donate a pint of blood?
- What's going on here?
- These two are poisoning this child!
- Now hold it!
-  May I say something?
No!
This is a hospital.
You're doctors.
You ought to behave like doctors.
So unless you've got work to do here, out!
Vamoose!
- Someone has to protect this child.
- Don't worry about it.
- Finish the story later, kid.
- You will not finish the story.
Eat those onions one at a time.
- You want smut?
I'll give you smut.
- Do you realize what A little occupational therapy?
- It's for the kid.
- You're very talented.
It looks like a pregnant bagpipe.
Do bagpipes get pregnant?
Of course they do.
Right after they make those funny sounds.
He really reaches you, huh?
He may just be the cutest kid I've ever seen in my life.
- Mind if I come in?
- You're a little in to be asking.
Hey, that's beautiful.
What is that?
That's one of the new fall line of cows' udders.
It's for the kid.
What'd you find out about him?
Oh, nothing.
I drew an absolute blank.
- What do you mean, nothing?
- He had to live somewhere.
Well, wherever it is, it ain't no more.
Whoever was there, they ain't either anymore.
- That's impossible.
- Right.
People don't just disappear.
What, in a war?
Well, we gotta find out something about him.
What do we do?
Colonel Blake is doing it right now.
Lemme start again, Sister.
A little boy came in, just cute as a bug's ear, about five years old, and he was wounded.
Now, we And we can't keep him here.
Uh, I agree with you there.
This is no place for a child.
I wouldn't be here myself if it wasn't for the war.
What's that?
Uh, no, we can't locate the folks or the village.
Yeah, so I think he'd be a lot better off in your hands.
Oh, I'd say he'd be up in another few days or so, - and then I'd like very much to - Henry?
- We want to talk to you.
- Look, then.
I'll hand him over, say, uh, first of the week.
Right.
Okay.
See you in church.
Well, not really.
- Bye, Sister.
- Henry, what are you doing?
Oh, uh, I'm playing with my doll, Pierce.
Getting a head start on senility?
Radar tells us that you're gonna send the kid to the orphanage.
Hey, Radar, I thought you were working for me.
Uh, they got it out of me.
- How?
- Uh, by listening.
- Is it true?
- About the orphanage?
I've got no choice.
This is a hospital.
We can't take care of a child.
I never saw you as a villain before, Henry.
I am not a villain.
I do not tie girls to buzz saws, and I don't throw banana peels in front of the old folks' home.
No, you just put five-year-olds in orphanages.
Get off my back.
- Let us make him our responsibility.
- We'll take care of him.
Boy, that is rich.
You guys are barely housebroken yourselves.
Look, you're just gonna have to leave it with me.
- Radar, I am disappointed.
- Uh, yes, sir.
Watch it.
He'll send you to an orphanage.
- This is a side of you I never saw.
- Never mind my sides, Mclntyre.
Look, you think I want to send this little fella away?
I've got two kids of my own.
I'm a former child myself.
- It's cruel, Henry.
- What isn't around here?
If you guys have got something better than Sister Theresa's, I'm all ears.
Figured.
"At first I thought it was the war "and this stinking place that made me, "well, love him, I guess.
"But now I know it's more than that.
"The reasons aren't important.
"We think his parents are dead.
"Henry Blake wants to send him to an orphanage, and I hate the idea so much, I can't stand it".
"I want us to adopt him, honey.
"He'd be the son we never had.
"I know the girls would be out of their little minds to have a brother.
"This is a decision we both have to make.
"Think about it carefully.
You know my feelings.
Now it's really in your hands".
That's beautiful.
Okay, it's beautiful.
But is it a mistake?
How can you make a mistake giving a kid his life?
You're all daddy.
I just had my first lesson in Korean.
I'll be right back.
Look at it, look at it.
Now you say "boo".
- Boo!
- Ah!
Gone!
Oh, you do?
Well, blow in my ear.
Blow in my ear.
Oh, look.
I think you blew it right through.
Ahh!
You found it already.
How about that?
Now let's do that other one.
Oh, frankly, we didn't expect any complications, Sister, but he is running a little temp.
Uh-huh.
Uh, excuse me.
Anything from Mclntyre's wife?
What's that?
Oh, another few days, I think.
- Uh, but, uh, we've got a pre -  Shh!
Shh!
We've got a pretty sick little boy on our hands.
Yes.
Thank you for calling, Sister.
Yeah.
You are gonna get me in trouble.
"And then the three little bears" Uh, bears sam kom.
Three little bears, sam kom, got up from the table Uh, "table" is, uh Siktak.
Siktak.
Table.
Got up from the table, and they walked up the stairs.
-  - They got up the stairs.
And then Let's see what happens now.
- Good evening, Margaret.
- Hello, Frank.
- It's Thursday night.
- So?
So?
I plan my week around Thursday nights.
My hands were trembling when I put my shorts on.
Frank!
Not in front of the K-l-D.
Are you telling me, Margaret, were not going to have our discussion tonight?
I'm reading to him.
Are you going to do all three bears?
He's going to spend the night with me.
But, Margaret, I have so much to discuss.
It can wait.
We haven't had a discussion in a whole week.
What about Monday?
I'm not counting short talks.
Oh, Frank.
- I've got to go.
I'm on the next shift.
- Lucky next shift.
- He was asleep, wasn't he?
- I'm almost sure.
- Don't worry.
- I did hear some loud snoring noises.
- That was me.
- Good-bye.
Oh, wait, wait.
Don't forget your dog tags.
"35591715".
- Even your number is pretty.
- You're sweet.
Tonight, 39591715?
- Where?
- Here.
- I don't know.
- Oh, I'm sure he'll be asleep again.
Okay.
Good morning, children.
- Hello, Father.
- Good morning, Father.
Did I interrupt anything?
No.
We're just going over each other's medical profiles.
Good.
I really stopped by to see Trapper.
Is he here?
Yeah, but I'm asleep.
Well, thank you, Nurse, for coming by.
That was very helpful.
- Trapper, the letter from your wife.
- I haven't gotten it yet.
Hey, it's from Louise.
I have the feeling it's good news.
You didn't hold it up to the light, did you, Father?
Oh, now, I would never  "This is to inform you that you are about to become the proud father of a five-year-old Korean boy".
- Hey!
- Wait a minute.
There's more.
"Cathy and Becky are thrilled about having a new brother.
"Go ahead with the adoption papers and army red tape as soon as you can.
"If there's anything I can do to help at this end, just let me know.
"I'm excited as you are, darling.
Everything here is Everything here is fine.
We all miss you.
Love you, Louise".
Hey, hey, we did it!
Father, we had a baby!
I was sure it was good news.
Congratulations, father.
Thank you, Father.
We're up to our navels in fathers.
Wait a second.
I was saving this just in case.
I have to ask you, just one apiece, please.
You know something?
This is probably the nicest day we've ever had here.
If we had a balcony, we could throw money to the peasants.
Your happiness is inspiring.
Maybe this is why I was sent to Korea.
Maybe, but I wouldn't underestimate your draft board.
Up until now, I felt my being here was senseless.
For the first time, I think I have a real reason for being here.
That's the beginning of faith, Trapper.
Father, you made a big score this morning.
Don't press.
- You happy, Frank?
- Happy?
I'm with you 10,000 miles from home in war-torn Korea.
I'm the happiest man in the world.
So am I. You're really so beautiful the way the sun lights up the hairs in your ear.
Oh, Frank, do you know how exciting you are?
It takes one to know one.
Margaret, how do you feel about outdoor discussions?
Hi, kids.
Missed you down at the sugar bowl.
Oh!
Oh, this war is so crowded.
Is this your idea of taking the kid on a picnic?
Where is he?
Well, he was here a minute ago.
-  - Terrific!
Hold it!
I gotta get the kid outta here.
- You want to make him an orphan again?
- He mustn't move.
- There must be a map to this field.
- Get it!
- Don't move!
- Ohh!
- What a time not to understand English.
- Kutchio nuguo!
- What does that mean?
- That means "stop and stay" in Korean.
- Kutchio!
- Yes!
Kutchio!
I'll be right back.
Kutchio!
Zowie!
Why can't I do that when I'm really playing?
Maybe you should take the bedpan out on the course with you, sir.
- Watch it, Henry!
- This is a 2-par bedpan.
You ruined it.
- Radar, where do you keep the maps?
- What maps?
- What's going on?
- The kid just crawled in the minefield.
- Holy cow!
- Minefield, right.
- Why aren't they under "M"?
- Because they're under "B" for "boom".
- Nuguo!
- I got the maps!
- Anybody know how to read these things?
- I know how to read a map.
- I took a course in map reading.
- All right, good.
All right, let's see, my left hand is west, right?
Oh, marvelous.
He's right.
It's west.
Okay, just keep your shirt on, Mclntyre.
- Hi, boy.
- No!
Don't do that.
- Kutchio!
- Now, let's see Okay, O'Brien's on his way.
The red dots indicate the mines.
- All right.
- Right.
All right, Mclntyre, from where you are there, you can walk straight for 25 feet before you get to one.
- Eight yards.
- Just take eight steps.
Hold it!
Right.
There's one right in front of you.
- Now what?
- What next?
All right, let's see.
Oh, yeah, this is marked off in grids.
Right.
We're in business.
You okay, Mclntyre?
I'm still here.
Okay, now, uh, what you want to do is you wanna walk three-and-a-half grids to your right.
- Three-and-a-half grids?
- What's a grid?
- How many "whats" in a grid?
- Let's see, uh, there's, uh There's two pints in a quart and there's two hectares in an acre.
Who cares, Henry?
What's a grid?
Well, will you let me just check the scale?
All right, an inch is a foot and a half, and my finger's three inches.
- How do you know that?
- My finger's always been three inches.
Well, Henry, will you get your three-inch finger out and tell me?
All right, now, here's what I want you to do.
I want you to take one and a half steps to your right.
Good.
Okay.
Now, that oughta put you safely in the heart of downtown Berlin.
- Berlin?
- Yeah.
What are you talkin' about?
This is a World War II surplus map!
Trapper, don't move!
- You're damn right I won't!
- Here you go, sir.
- Trapper.
- Yeah.
Don't make a move.
Six inches in any direction, and you'll get home sooner than any of us.
Anything I can do?
I hope not, Father.
- Where's O'Brien?
- Wait for it.
There you go.
Just in time for the Little League game.
Sorry about the map.
Colonel Blake?
Sister Theresa.
Kim.
Kim!
She came to me looking for her son.
I took a chance.
Buy you a drink, Trap?
Who needs a kid that wanders off into minefields?
Right.
Back home, he'd probably be, probably be crossing against the lights.
Come on.
Aw, my wife.
She was terrific.
She really came through.
Ah, they don't write wives like that anymore.
Oh, hey, guys.
Kim got off all right.
Sister Theresa says that he's gonna come back for a visit.
- Oh, that's nice.
- Very nice.
Sir, are you still interested in adopting a son?
I've been doing some researching.
There's a little boy down in Got anything about five-foot-five?
- Well, no, he's, uh - Who wears dirty eyeglasses?
- Never shaves?
- A two-striper?
Well, I am a little old, but we could try it for a week.
Sit down.
Your father and I will tell you what we did to have you.
Cut it out.

Be sure to see this with a marine you love.
I've seen it before, but that part where she loses the baby always makes me cry.
Well, they weren't married.
She had to lose it.
Single people can't have babies.
It's a medical fact in Hollywood.
Tomorrow night?
The Flying Leathernecks with John Wayne?
Tonight isn't over yet.
Don't they ever show anything but war pictures?
I think the army's trying to prove movies are hell.
- Apres vous.
We're home.
- You're pretty fast with that plural.
I go on duty in a couple of hours.
- I won't spoil you for the big game.
- Tomorrow night.
A handshake?
That's all you got?
She sounds like a weirdo.
Possibly a fetish.
There's a case in Krafft-Ebing.
A woman shook hands with 400 strange men in one night.
Her hand is on display at the Berlin Academy of Medicine and Whoopee.
Stop.
You're getting me excited.
I haven't had a handshake since I was in high school.
Well, my money's on you, Hawk.
You're the top scorer in the league.
Disgusting!
Why is it whenever I come in here, it's disgusting?
I think that says it all, Frank.
Ohh!
This is the last straw!
Remind me to order more straws.
- You've been reading my letter!
- What letter, Frank?
This letter I'm writing to my wife.
I always pull a hair out and place it on the paper, and that hair is gone.
Maybe your paper is losing its hair.
Imagine writing a bald letter home.
Why would we read your stupid letter?
I got my own wife to write.
"My darling.
I'm exhausted.
I've done 11 major operations in the last two days.
" You did read it!
You, you guys!
- We are not!
-  Doc, can I see you?
It's about a patient outside.
Oh, I'd like to, Phil, but right now I'm on drunk duty.
Major Burns is the ranking medical officer here.
And as such, I order you to see the patient.
Please, Hawkeye.
It's important.
- If it's important - Write your wife.
Save your hair.
-  - There he is.
That's the patient.
Boy, did his draft board go crazy.
Hi.
Would you turn on the headlights?
- Step into my office.
- He's been crying constantly, Doc.
- A couple of days.
- How you doin', pal?
It's probably just a touch of colic.
Does that hurt when I press here?
I don't feel anything.
I think it must just be colic.
I'll see if I can get you some stuff at the dispensary.
- He's gonna be all right.
- Doc, there's something else.
I'm being shipped home.
I don't want to leave them.
- You're not married?
- Sort of.
Sort of married is like sort of a virgin.
She wouldn't, um I mean, she said we had to be married first.
So we got married.
You gave her your dog tags?
You drank out of the same canteen?
I had the cook marry us.
He used to be an altar boy.
No wonder everything tastes like candles around here.
- When are you getting shipped home?
- Couple of weeks.
You know what's involved in getting permission to marry a Korean?
It takes a couple of weeks just to find the guy who tells you it takes a year.
- That's why I came to you.
- You couldn't just go home with a Japanese bathrobe or a turtle with MacArthur painted on its back?
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.
Oh, hey, Phil, when it comes time, see me about the circumcision, not the cook.
- Uh, sir?
- I can't sign anything now.
I'm sterile.
Oh, uh, well, I found the forms for enlisted men marrying L.I.P.'s, sir.
- Great.
- L.I.P.'s?
That's army for the natives.
It stands for "local indigenous personnel".
Leave it to the army to remind us nobody's human.
Lemme see the next one.
We went through the same routine with Corporal Berlinger.
- Remember, sir?
- Yeah, Berlinger, right.
- Show us the rest at the table, will ya?
- Uh, uh, sir?
Uh, the plane with John Wayne didn't get here.
- Darn it!
- What movie are we showing tonight?
What have we got on hand?
Well, I could give you Bonzo Goes to College or The Thing That Ate the Bronx.
- Show 'em both.
- Preferably at the same time.
Yes, sir.
- What happened to Berlinger?
- He shacked up with this pretty local.
They wanted to get married.
Oh, look at that chunk of metal in this kid's belly.
Big enough to be a '38 Buick.
Okay, thanks, pal.
- So?
- Intelligence started an investigation.
- It's S.O.P. - What happened?
Well, they went into her background.
Suction.
Her family, you know.
The war's made a lot of these girls chippies.
- Easy, Henry.
- We're out of chippies, Doctor.
I can give you a retractor.
- We'll do the jokes, Nurse.
- Yes, Doctor.
Henry, why is it assumed that any girl who isn't a blue-eyed, blonde-haired baton twirler is automatically a pro?
Forceps.
If you're getting on a soapbox, we'll have to crank up the table.
- Clamp.
How about some retraction here?
- Wow.
Look at that.
- He's sitting too close to the war.
- You're not gonna believe this.
Berlinger's investigation took a year and a half.
- Happy ending?
- He got married.
- Good.
- To the WAC who did all the paperwork.
- Bad.
- Yeah.
- Henry, I can't let Walker down.
- I know, I know.
Clamp.
We gotta get them married before their kid is old enough to get drafted.
## - Nice idea, this.
- It's better than the movie.
Once you see something eat the Bronx, you've seen everything eat the Bronx.
These are good.
I'm lucky the cook wasn't marrying anybody tonight.
- Am I supposed to understand that?
- Not really.
I like eating outside.
In fact, I like doing almost anything outside.
Fair enough.
Your tree or mine?
I said almost anything.
In that case, I may just teach you to play golf one day.
- I'm a three handicap.
- Then you can teach me to play golf.
What else are you good at?
And I don't mind moving your answer indoors.
A couple of things.
But I even enjoy things I'm not good at.
You interest me strangely.
Maybe we could be terrible at something together.
Well, I'm a rotten dancer, but I enjoy it.
Excuse me.
I couldn't help noticing you're a wallflower because you're such a rotten dancer.
Everybody wants to go to the parking lot, but nobody wants to dance with me.
I also want to go to the parking lot, but first I'll teach you to dance.
- Are you any good?
- I taught Sarah Bernhardt how to dance.
- She had a wooden leg.
- I had to charge her extra.
Now, the secret is three little steps.
Step one.
- That was step two.
- What's step three?
Which brings us to step four.
- I thought there were only three.
- That's just for regular students.
I think you're ready for advanced training.
I think so too, but I don't think this is the right classroom.
How about tomorrow?
My tent?
- You have any records to dance to?
- No.
Good.
I hate dancing.
Uh, sir?
What is it, Radar?
I finished the S-3 L.I.P. Forms on Corporal Walker.
The C.I.D. Called, and they're sending a Lt.
Willis to investigate.
- He should be here at any time.
- That's nice.
I also got four officers to sign theJ-19 application and the character reference.
- Sir?
- Yo.
- Uh, John Wayne didn't show up again.
- Oh, rats!
Well, what are we gonna show?
- You got any Bonzos left?
- Just one, sir.
Bonzo Runs For President.
- Well, that sounds good.
Show that.
- Yes, sir.
And The Thing That Ate the Bronx.
I could see that every night.
Oh, me too.
Also, sir, Majors Burns and Houlihan request permission to see you.
Permission denied.
Tell 'em I'm busy.
- They're here, right?
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.
- Major Burns wants to make a complaint.
- A very serious, formal complaint.
- What is it, Frank?
He feels that Cpl.
O'Reilly has been involved in the Walker matter to the exclusion of every other administrative function on this base.
- Really, Frank?
-  Yes!
Supply requisitions are not being processed.
Duty rosters are late.
I can go on for an hour.
It's incredible.
I mean, Frank, I never saw your lips move once.
How do you do that?
We're running a hospital, not a marriage bureau.
I'm expecting a C.I.D. Man here momentarily.
Then we can dispose of this Walker matter quick as a bunny.
Only Captain Pierce could get action that fast.
Just another example of who's really running this outfit.
- That's pretty strong stuff, Frank.
- It's true!
You're nothing but a golf-playing figurehead.
Watch your language, Frank, or I might have to punch her right in the mouth.
Are you just gonna stand there and wait until the birds cover you with leaves?
I haven't said anything because I'm livid!
I happen to have a blood pressure situation.
If I ever let myself go Splack!
Splack?
I want you to know that I agree with everything I've said.
The army has clear-cut guidelines and procedures for marriage applications.
Marriage is serious.
It requires careful thought and consideration.
Both parties need to think about it to protect the sanctity of the institution.
I know in my own case that only cool deliberation beforehand made my marriage a great union that will endure forever.
Oh, Frank!
Well, Frank, win a few, lose a few.
Don't take off too much, Sol.
Regina's crazy about me the way I am.
Who can blame her?
- Can I have the car tonight, Dad?
- I'm afraid not, Andy.
You'll only drive out to some lonely spot and start shaking hands.
No, that was just the first date.
We're way past the handshake stage.
- The earth's gonna tremble tonight?
- Also stars will fall on Alabama.
On a scale of ten, I'd say this is nine and three-quarters.
Your problem is, you lack confidence.
Would you like a little tonic?
Why not?
I know I smell great the way I am, but better wouldn't hurt.
You don't have any tonic!
No, but I have a date.
Bye.
I would remind you, sir, you are a married man.
That's only an ugly rumor started by my wife.
There you go, Frank.
Write your heart out.
- Captain Pierce?
- Yo!
Come in.
Lieutenant Willis, C.I.D., Tokyo.
- You live here?
- Oh, well, you came at a bad time.
We just had the place cleaned up.
Pierce, I've been assigned this Walker deal.
- Oh, that was fast.
- I'm going to have to interview you.
Okay.
I get up early or I get up late.
You name it.
I was thinkin' of now.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I have an appointment.
- Why the stall?
- This is a hospital.
Doctors and nurses.
Where you have doctors and nurses, you have a lot of operating going on.
Some of it even in surgery.
Your story has touched my heart, Doc, but I fractured my tail getting up here.
So when do you want to do it?
Now or never?
Let me put it this way.
I respect how intimidated you make me feel.
- Can I offer you one?
- Homemade hooch?
This is wonder booze, the elixir of life.
Keeps us going.
As long as you're pouring.
Thanks.
First off, I want as much dope as you can give me about this Walker guy.
- Happy days.
- Cheers.
Whoo!
What's in this stuff?
Oh, a little bit of this, a little bit of that, a lot of dreams.
- Klinger, you got it.
- Oh, the cook fixed it up very nice.
Be careful.
Don't spill the gravy.
Will you do me a favor?
Take it over to Lt.
Hoffman.
Tell her I'll be there in half an hour.
Unavoidable, okay?
You got it.
Lieutenant.
What's that?
Corporal Klinger.
He's bucking to get out.
I wouldn't take him out for a $50 bill.
That's highly irregular.
Well, it's harmless.
Okay, tell me about Walker and tell me about the broad.
Uh, if you don't mind, can we refer to her as "Kim" and/or the "young lady"?
Do you know why those young ladies want to marry our guys?
Huh?
You think they're really crazy about us, right?
Gee, I don't know why anybody would wanna marry an American to get away from poverty and dysentery and starvation.
You just can't please some people.
- You a Republican or a Democrat?
- Who are you investigating?
I've got to know your character if you're vouching for his.
I tell ya, a lot of wrong thinking a lot of wrong thinking in this man's army.
Got some more of this turpentine?
All you want.
So I'm taking out all my shoulder pads.
I really feel that natural look is much more soft and it helps the bustline.
- It's been almost an hour.
- Well, he did say it was unavoidable.
How about a little more chicken?
It's delicious.
Do you have trouble sleeping with curlers?
Lieutenant, I've given you a lot of information.
Unless you're writing a novel about Walker, it seems to me that'd be enough.
I'll tell you, I don't see how we can leapfrog procedure.
Nothing special here.
Lieutenant there's a baby.
You're kidding.
The shack-up has produced a shack-let.
Walker wants to take the girl and their child back home.
That's why the rush.
They got a kid and they're not even married?
- It's been known to happen.
- Are you crazy?
You call me down here to tell me the guy has a baby?
Oh.
Gimme some more.
Anybody we know?
That is unfortunately not the late Lt.
Willis, C.I.D. What happened?
He came here investigating Walker.
I told him about the baby.
- You nuts?
- I'm an old-fashioned idiot.
I think two people who have a child have a right to get married.
Well, you sure fouled up Walker.
Your friendly neighborhood C.I.D. Man.
That's a real picture.
Almost suitable for framing.
What do you think?
- It's worth a try.
- You get started.
I'll be right back.
##  - Oh, it's you.
- Sorry.
I just came over to apologize.
- The coq au vin was delicious.
- Well, why not?
Vintage chicken.
Army surplus, '39.
Look, I just need a little more time, but I'll be back, okay?
Then exactly at midnight, we'll take off our masks and go to pieces.
Oh, come on.
That's just a deposit.
You get the rest later.
The rest goes like this.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Terrible!
-  - How do you feel?
- Pierce, remember?
- Who's that?
That's Walker?
Oh, that's Mclntyre.
Captain Mclntyre, Lieutenant Willis.
Please don't get up, even if you can.
I warned you.
This stuff is murder, huh?
- How long have I been here?
- About two hours.
And three nurses.
A brassiere?
Or earmuffs, depending on the weather.
The lieutenant's uniform, sir.
Cleaned and pressed.
The corporal does nice work.
We got out all the stains except for the mascara on your Good Conduct ribbon.
- Thank you, Corporal.
- You're welcome, sir.
Your pictures will be ready in 20 minutes.
Pictures of me and the girls.
A little memento of your visit to the 4077 th.
All beautifully bound in an album engraved "Kill".
Pictures?
Lipstick on the shirt?
A bra?
What was in the booze?
- Nothing.
- More than we can say for the bra.
A setup so I'd okay the Walker application.
Right!
Forget it!
You calling our bluff?
I've framed more guys in my lifetime than you'll operate on.
Yes, I'm calling your bluff.
Yeah.
How can you be sure it didn't happen?
And if it did happen, we might send the pictures to your wife.
- Or your commanding officer.
- It never happened.
You're right.
We don't have any pictures.
- It never happened.
- But how can you be sure?
And if we make a case out of it, proof or not, it goes on your record.
Hey, Lieutenant, you're right, don't sign it.
Take a chance.
Yeah.
What do I care if Walker marries some bimbo?
Let's see him get an apartment back in the States with a Korean wife!
- How about a little drink?
- What, on top of this?
I'll tell you somethin', the way you guys operate, I wouldn't mind if you took care of my hernia.
With or without pictures?
- Here we are.
- Plural at last.
- You make me nervous.
- I'm doing my best.
I've been nervous since the first time I saw you.
You got a remedy, Doctor?
- Take two aspirin and go to bed.
- I don't have any aspirin.
Well, we can skip the first part.
A toast first.
- To the beginning.
- And the middle and the end.
Boy, when you make a toast, you don't fool around.
Ohh.
- Hawkeye?
- Yes.
Whatever.
You never told me what all the unavoidable delay tonight was about.
A couple people I know wanted to get married and l I expedited the paperwork.
- Oh, that's sweet.
You're a sweet man.
- I love your perception.
Why a bad time?
The army wasn't sure the girl was good enough for one of their draftees.
But You know Phil Walker over in X-ray?
Her name is Kim.
Personally, I prefer "Regina".
- Kim?
Isn't that a Korean name?
- No, not necessarily.
But in this case, it is, which works out fine 'cause Kim is Korean.
You fixed it so someone could marry a Korean?
That's why you stood me up?
Who stood you up?
You don't see this adorable person sitting here, lips at the ready?
I just want to make sure I have all the facts, that's all.
What is this, an interview for Stars and Stripes?
Fact one: Phil loves Kim and Kim loves Phil.
So much so they created fact two a baby.
Phil is being shipped home, and he wants to take his wife and baby with him.
Pretty complicated, huh?
And so you had to arrange for a marriage between one of our guys and a gook.
- Kim is Korean.
- It's a matter of semantics.
What What are you trying to tell me?
You don't care for L.I.P.'s?
Well, not when they marry our people.
Our people?
Since I'm one of them, now who, who are we?
- Whites, silly.
- Oh, us.
Of course.
- What are you doing?
- I think I want my handshake back.
You're built, Lieutenant.
You You've got a body I'd like to take a lifetime getting to know.
Once I've learned it, I'd like to start at the top and go to the bottom again.
But somewhere in that luscious chemistry are some pretty unappetizing ideas.
I don't think I can take the mix.
Good night, Lieutenant Hoffman.
Make that good-bye, Lieutenant Hoffman.
I forgot my wine.
Is that all?
No.
Actually, there's one more thing.
In sickness and in health, till death do you part.
The ring, please.
Hey, your mommy and daddy are getting married.
- "With this ring" - With this ring, I thee wed.
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Hey, guys, guys!
- I caught the bouquet!
- Well, don't look at me.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
We're late.
Use the officers'.
Thirteen, fifteen.
Let's go.
- Relax.
You don't have a chance.
- I'll beat your brains out.
Ahh!
- Hey, Henry.
Where you going?
- Yo.
Down to Regimental Headquarters.
- Bring back some fresh nurses.
- Make sure they're lean.
- Be good, now.
- So long, sirs.
Don't forget to tip the driver.
Aah!
- Are those gurney tables?
- Right.
And those are surgical masks.
You're playing Ping-Pong!
I told you it was Ping-Pong.
- Absolutely right, Frank.
Dismissed.
- Dismissed?
Listen, with Blake gone, I'm in command of this outfit.
Oh, in that case, dismissed, sir.
We'll see how funny you good-time Charlies are when Frank Burns is number one around here, permanently.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
That's for me to know and for you to find out.
Frank, you're begging for a deviated septum.
You'll find out.
This hearing is to determine your fitness to command.
A serious charge has been filed against you by Majors Burns and Houlihan.
We'll begin with the lesser charges against Lieutenant Colonel Blake, Major Murphy.
-  Yes, General.
Colonel Blake?
- Yes, sir?
- I'm sorry, sir.
Excuse me.
- My fault.
It was my fault.
I should have been more careful.
Can we get on with this?
Colonel Blake, it is alleged that on or about Kentucky Derby Day, there were gurney races held at your unit and that betting took place.
- Is this true?
- Exactly what is a gurney?
Um, well, General, it's a rolling table that we use to transport patients to and from the various places that we have to take them to and from from.
- "To and from from"?
- Yes, sir.
Okay, Gal O' War!
Gal O' War!
Gal O' War!
Okay, Gal O' War!
Gal O' War!
Gal O' War!
Make your bets and put on a good race.
Last chance.
Place your best, folks.
Don't miss your chance.
Well, I see y'all have got the second post position again, Culpepper.
Sir, this position has been handed down from Culpepper to Culpepper.
That's a fine-lookin' filly you have there, sir.
She also has been handed down from Culpepper to Culpepper.
Y'all, uh, this is your colonel.
Only one minute to post time.
All right.
Come on.
This is your last chance before the big race to make your bets.
Come on, soldier.
Hey, Klinger, wanna make a bet on the race?
I'm busy.
Radar, I'm finally getting out.
Wait'll you see what I'm making out of this red satin.
- I like you in anything.
-  All right.
Come on.
Make your bets.
All right, folks, the gurneys are ready.
They're at the post.
Let's go!
And there they go!
As we round the clubhouse turn, it's Hawk's Pride, with Gal O' War, Girl Away and Bouncing Betty!
And in the lead, it's Hawk's Pride, and Gal O' War, Girl Away and Bouncing Betty.
- Decadent.
- Gurney races.
- With girls on top of them.
- Pushing them around.
Doctors pushing nurses.
- Frank.
- Me too.
Where can we go?
Out back of the lard cans.
And Bouncing Betty Bouncing Betty is starting to make a move on the outside.
Girl Away.
It's Hawk's Pride and Gal O' War.
Gal O' War And a real battle for third between Girl Away and Bouncing Betty.
Bouncing Betty starting to drop behind.
Hawk's Pride widening the lead, with Gal O' War, Girl Away.
Bouncing Betty starts to make her move.
Hawk's Pride's coming up fast on the inside.
Gal O' War is taking the outside.
And it's Girl Away.
Bouncing Betty is really bouncing along, with Girl Away, Gal O' War, and Hawk's Pride in the lead.
Hawk's Pride is coming, and it's neck and neck between Hawk's Pride And the winner is Gal O' War by a by a by, uh The winner is Gal O' War.
So you not only condoned the activity, you participated in it.
Well, uh, we work hard, Major.
We need some relaxation.
Even if it violates every rule in the book.
General, just prior to our Kentucky Derby Day, our operating room, we handled over, uh uh I've got the casualty figures here somewhere, sir.
- Uh, Radar, do you - Yes, sir.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault again.
Proceed, Major!
Charge two states one of your enlisted men engaged in the, uh, business of selling Hi-Style wing-tip shoes from the Style Right Shoe Company of Storm Lake, Iowa.
- The Style Right what?
- Shoe Company.
Style Right Shoe Company.
I read it on the back of a matchbook.
It said that you could earn extra money in your spare time selling Hi-Style wing-tip shoes.
How did this work?
Well, you just filled in your name and address and stuff, and they sent you a demo shoe, a measuring thing and, uh, an order blank.
But you're a corporal in the United States Army.
Well, that's not my fault, sir.
- Hey, Klinger, wait up!
- I'm busy.
Good morning, sir.
My name is Radar O'Reilly.
I represent the Style Right Shoe Company of Storm Lake, Iowa.
Could I interest you in a pair of really nifty black-and-white wing-tip shoes for only 8.95?
No, but I could use a pair of black-and-white pumps with a rhinestone buckle at any price.
Anybody home?
No.
Good morning, sir.
My name is Radar O'Reilly.
I represent the Style Right Shoe Company of Storm Lake, Iowa.
Please come in, Mr. O'Reilly.
Thank you.
I would like to interest you in a pair of our Hi-Style wing-tip shoes for only 8.95.
- Do I sit down?
- Well, I think you almost have to.
Oh.
Uh, nice place you have here.
Well, it's cruddy, but it's home.
Have you been doing this long?
No, actually, uh, this is my first day.
Oh, I think you'll do well.
You found my foot without any trouble at all.
Oh, and if I may say so, sir, it is a very handsome foot.
Thanks.
I like it.
Uh, well, as you can see, this is an all-leather shoe, with a built-in arch support to give you hours of comfort and good looks.
- I can see that, yes.
- Well, sir, as our company slogan says Oh, yeah.
"If your shoes aren't becoming to you, then you should be coming to us".
Actually, Mr. O'Reilly, I already have a pair of black-and-white shoes.
Excuse me, sir, but you don't have Style Right black-and-white shoes.
Uh, that's true, yeah.
But l l I really don't I can't afford to You can't afford not to give your feet the best home they ever had.
Yeah.
Right.
Well, no, I'd I'm sorry.
I really I'm not But I'm just I'm Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Did you participate in this business venture, Colonel Blake?
Of course not.
I can't wear wing-tip shoes.
I have an extremely high arch.
- They've got arch supports.
- Well, they weren't high enough.
I have to have extra-high supports.
They could have put those in.
You just didn't wanna spend the extra dollar ninety-five.
- That's not true.
- It is too.
- Gentlemen!
Gentlemen!
Charge three states you have a noncom who is a transvestite.
Well, I don't pry into a man's religion, sir.
A transvestite wears dresses, Colonel.
- Oh, Klinger.
- Yes.
Well, you see, Klinger is not your typical recruiting poster type.
It might be of some comfort to you to know that he spends most of his time trying to get out of the army.
I must say he's very inventive about it.
For, uh, several weeks, Klinger was keeping pretty much to himself.
Uh, he seemed, uh, preoccupied and didn't spend much time around camp during his off hours.
- Did you see that?
- What?
- A big red bird with fuzzy pink feet.
- Oh, really?
- Hey, Hawk, did you see that?
- What did you see?
A big red bird with fuzzy pink feet.
- See?
- Where were we?
So you confirm he was found two miles from the camp?
Yes, sir.
Laying there in an unconscious condition, looking like a big red bird with fuzzy pink feet.
Colonel, what did you think about Klinger's attempt to desert the United States Army?
Well, frankly, sir, I think, uh, he might have made it if he'd have had a better tailwind.
As you were.
This hearing will resume at 0900 hours tomorrow.
Colonel Blake, you're under arrest.
You will remain confined to regimental quarters until this hearing resumes.
Corporal O'Reilly, you'll return to your unit.
Blake, I suggest that you have O'Reilly bring back whatever documents you're going to need to defend yourself against the most serious of these charges falsifying records and lending aid and comfort to the enemy.
Oh, boy.
Ah, nice.
Keep a nice, even spread there, soldier.
I don't want to see any brush strokes.
- Frank?
It's against air raid regulations.
- Hmm?
If they're white, they can be seen by enemy planes.
Uh, just paint the top half and, uh, turn them over every night.
Hey, it's Radar.
When did you get back?
About a half a chicken ago.
Where's Henry?
Will you stop that vacuum effect and answer?
Colonel Blake is still at regimental headquarters.
He's under arrest.
- Henry?
- For what?
A whole lot of little stuff, but one really terrible one.
Giving aid and comfort to the enemy.
Henry wouldn't do a thing like that.
His draft board did it when they sent him here.
What are you talking about?
- Those are the charges.
- Well, who made them?
- Major Burns - And Houlihan.
- And Houlihan.
Please, not while you're eating.
Based on what?
I think it's about that Nurse Cratty business.
How did they find out?
All I know is I got to show 'em the file on her tomorrow morning.
- Uh, what do you say we show them Nurse Cratty too?
- In person.
We'll take care of that.
You get the files.
Oh, hey, thanks, guys.
I can't tell you how upset this makes me.
Eat something.
You've got exciting hands.
I am a nurse, silly.
Oh!
Right there.
Right there.
Mmm!
I've always said it.
Behind every great man there's a woman with a vibrator.
What do you want?
I think your salute is idling too fast.
Just what business do you men have with your commanding officer?
We want you to know, Commanding Officer, we're both aware of your finkery.
- Finkery?
- That's right.
You finked on Henry.
You were the fink and he was the finkee.
Henry Blake is unfit to command.
- We love him.
- Hard cheese.
This outfit is finally going to have a real man in charge.
- Good luck, fella.
- You deserve it, guy.
Leave this tent immediately.
- We're going all right.
- Down to Regimental.
- Yeah, with Nurse Cratty.
- To rescue our colonel.
To save his brass.
-  As you were.
- How were we?
You're both under arrest.
Oh.
This is a clear violation of the Geneva Convention: "No officer shall be confined in his underwear unless issued an athletic supporter with suitable insignia".
I don't mind that so much 'cause I got good legs.
But to take away our still.
How long does he think we can last on just food and water?
He's a doctor.
That's what kills me.
His patients have the same problem.
Look.
You're a captain.
I'm a captain.
That makes two captains against one major.
Now, if you were playing poker, and you had a pair of captains in the hole, - you'd bet your brains out.
- The trouble is, he's not one of a kind.
- That's right.
Hot Lips is a major too.
- That's a bigger pair.
- Meanwhile, back at headquarters - Our fearless leader.
- What do we do?
- I can't think here.
There's no booze, the place has been cleaned to within an inch of its life and your knees are driving me wild.
Don't get smart with me, soldier.
I'm cheap, but I'm not easy.
- Supper, sir.
- Here you go.
Where do you wanna eat?
Put it by the TV.
- I like your outfit.
- Thank you.
A lot of guys can't wear stuff like that.
Major Burns ordered me to get rid of all my dresses.
That's a shame.
Listen, if you guys need something to wear Corporal.
For nasal drip.
- I haven't got a nasal drip.
- Take it or I'll give you one.
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, I'll have this filled right away.
Attention, all personnel.
By order of Major Frank Burns, lights out in ten minutes sharp.
Anyone not in their own beds at that time will have to spend the night wherever they are.
The following people have volunteered to go on a ten-mile hike.
Hiya, Roy.
How you doing?
How about a beer?
Attaboy, Roy.
I did just like you told me.
I put the whole thing in his beer.
- Great.
- Take two bras out of petty cash.
We'll now address ourselves to the most serious charge made against you, Colonel.
Major.
It alleges that you falsified requisition records to obtain more plasma, penicillin and other vital medical material than your unit required.
Further, these were delivered to your unit but were not given to the officer in charge of supplies, - Major Houlihan, according to him.
- Her.
- Sir?
- Him's a her.
She's a she.
- Who's a she?
- He is.
- Houlihan?
- That's her.
- Proceed, Major.
It is further alleged, uh, these materials were used to give aid to North Koreans.
Now, you gave or sold said medical supplies to one Meg Cratty, an American nurse who has lived in Korea for the past 17 years and operates a clinic in an area some three miles north of the 38th Parallel.
Many of her patients are North Koreans.
- We're fighting the North Koreans, Colonel.
- I'm aware of that, General.
- That's treason!
- Are the allegations true, Colonel Blake?
Yes.
But-But-But-But I don't mean "yes" in the sense that, "Yes, I gave aid and comfort to the enemy" but rather, "Yes, Meg Cratty gave aid and comfort".
That's what I meant by my "yes, sir, sir, yes, sir, sir".
Then the charges made by Houlihan and Burns are substantially correct?
-  Yes, sir.
- Why are you slowing down, Frank?
Hurry up!
Watch that bomb hole!
Get over on your right, Frank!
Frank, what are you doing over on the right?
Get over on the left!
This hearing is to determine if court-martial proceedings are indicated.
You've given me no alternative but to recommend such proceedings.
- I understand, General.
- Don't you have anything to say in your own defense?
I was just trying to help.
- Pierce!
-  Who are these people?
- We wanna testify, sir.
- The cavalry's here, Henry.
##  - Uh, General, this is Captain Pierce.
- Pierce.
This is Captain Mclntyre.
That's, uh, Meg Cratty.
And that's, uh uh This is a sample of Henry Blake's work.
- Oh, brother, that's all I need.
- We're here to help Colonel Blake, sir.
Yeah, get me life in front of the firing squad.
You get any sleep, sir?
This girl, and dozens like her, will have healthy babies because of Henry Blake.
Now, I operate a clinic.
And when someone's sick, I don't ask about their politics.
Henry Blake is the only man who's ever helped me.
He's a caring, decent man, which is more than I can say about any of you high-priced bellhops.
- You're beautiful.
- I used to be, sonny.
May I say something, General?
Before Meg Cratty set up shop, seven out of ten babies born to the hill people never made it past the first few days.
My giving her penicillin and whatever just made her job a little easier.
No money changed hands, and I didn't deprive our own wounded kids of one thing.
I'm guilty.
That's my explanation.
So you can hang my butt from a flagpole.
General, request permission to address this hearing.
- Who are you?
- Majors Burns and Houlihan, sir.
- Which is which?
- Doesn't matter.
They're interchangeable.
- General, this man is A.W.O.L.
- So is he.
They're both AWOL.
That's only because we're absent without leave.
They drugged an M.P. And stole a jeep.
Whatever they've told you, these two are living proof of Henry Blake's unfitness for command.
I never claimed to be a junior General MacArthur.
Look, I'm a doctor, and I try to patch up wounded kids and run a hospital.
Right!
Having heard the charges and the colonel's explanations, I'm inclined to expunge the record.
In order to do that, I'll need you to drop your charges, Major.
- I assume you're willing to do so.
- Just a minute, General.
I am proud to serve in the United States Army and equally proud to fight in this war.
- My family came to America in 1927.
- Riding on a pony.
I will not drop these charges.
Colonel Blake's total refusal to go by the book is a slap in the face to the loyalty and devotion given to the flag by officers and men like Major Houlihan and myself.
Uh, therefore, I decline to change my position in any way, shape or form.
Excuse me, General.
Some new evidence has just come to light.
Major Burns.
- You wouldn't.
- In a minute.
- Uh-huh.
General, in view of certain circumstances, I, at this time, withdraw my charges.
Frank!
You're sure, Major?
Uh He is.
This hearing is adjourned.
I'd ask you all in for a drink, but the Officers' Club doesn't open for another hour.
I've got the key, General.
Fox, put yourself down for a Silver Star.
Major Burns.
Congratulations, Henry.
- Oh, thanks, Meg.
And good luck to you.
- Thanks.
Hey, Henry.
What you said there, that was terrific.
Yeah.
What the hell is the new evidence?
- What do you care?
You're free.
- Yeah, you're free!
"Dear Mrs. Burns, "since you're so proud of your husband as an officer, "it is sad to report that he is frequently out of uniform.
And maybe you should know with who".
- That's "whom".
- Oh.
"Whom".
Attention, all personnel.
Let's all turn out to greet our very own Colonel Blake.
Everybody hit the compound.
Everybody hit the compound.
Well, this is it, General.
It's an honor having you.
I just wanted to see what kind of a nut farm you were running here.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, sir.
But the, uh, 4077 th is just your run-of-the-mill everyday army camp.
Ten-hut!
Welcome home, sir.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Ooh, what a card!
Right in the old labonza.
- Labonza.
- Go ahead, cuddles.
Take a card.
Don't rush me.
That's against the rules.
- Frank, you slapped my wrist!
-  Dear Dad, The war goes on and on and on.
Our biggest enemy is boredom.
We don't know what to do with ourselves.
I've been writing obscene prescriptions and throwing them into the nurses'tent.
You know it's boring when Trapper and Frank Burns do anything together.
Gin.
- You cheated!
- Of course I did.
How else could I win?
Just don't talk to me for the rest of the war!
How about the next war?
That'll be okeydoke with me, fella!
Fine.
We don't talk for this war and World War III.
Moron.
Even though we don't get along personally, we do manage to have a professional animosity.
The O.R. Continues to be a very funny place, if you can laugh as you throw up.
It's like smorgasbord in the slaughterhouse.
Everything looks so bad.
Let's do the sigmoid colon before we go into the bladder, okay?
Okay.
"In India's sunny clime, where I used to spend my time, "a-servin' of Her Majesty, the Queen, of all that black-faced crew, "the finest man I knew was our regimental bhisti, Gunga Din.
"Though I've belted you and flayed you, by the living God that made you, you're a better man than I am, Gunga Din".
- Metzenbaum scissors.
- Are we having poetry in surgery now?
"There was a young lady from Kent who took off her" Steady, Henry.
- How you doin'?
- Okay, Doc.
Okay.
That about does it, but we need another unit of plasma.
-  For me?
- Yeah, we got a special this week.
Take a pint of blood, then we give you 6 free highball glasses that break easily.
-  - Give me a bottle of your best stuff.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Make sure I get the right color, eh?
- Huh?
- I wouldn't want that darkie stuff.
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
- Colonel?
- Yeah.
Just a minute.
Collins?
- Yeah?
- Sir, you'd better look at this.
- Where is this guy?
- He's in the scrub room.
Radar, you can't let anybody in here with a grenade in his pants.
- He's not wearing pants, sir.
- Holy cow.
Collins, take over.
Jones, assist him.
Houlihan, we'll need your help.
I want a spinal tray, a major pack and some bone instruments.
You'll need some more light.
I'll get a spot.
Out of here, Radar.
Pierce, look at this.
Kid's in the pre-op.
Let's go.
Occasionally we get a kid with an unexploded grenade that's been shot into his body, something they neglected to tell us about in med school.
The procedure is simple: You operate on a human time bomb while your life flashes in front of you, and you'll promise God anything if He'll keep you patient from blowing up.
There must be an easier way for a surgeon to make $413.50 a month.
All right, Pierce.
There's the fluke.
Get another glove, honey.
All right.
Get me some towels.
- Towels, towels.
- Boy, what a mess.
We're all fine.
Now, you get out of here, all you nurses.
- Let's go.
- Forget the sandbags.
Just get out.
- I think that's long enough.
- We'll soon see.
Scalpel.
All right.
Take it easy.
Give me some scissors.
-  I think that's long enough.
- Well, don't shake him.
- Sponge.
- Sponge.
Boy, this is one hot potato.
- This kid can't be 18.
- Let's see if we can get him to 19.
Sponge.
There it is.
Who's gonna lift it out?
How 'bout the late me?
Give me some retraction.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Steady.
Easy.
Easy.
Okay.
Get it out of here.
I'm glad to report the patient and the doctor survived.
There followed another operation which we natives here call the "happy hour".
There followed another operation which we natives here call the "happy hour".
It's a chance to meet your neighbor, to do better than meet your neighbor.
- This is nice.
- Mm.
I bet we could dance great together too.
- It really doesn't hurt?
- I've done a hundred hernias.
- I should have it done, huh?
- Absolutely.
Take off your dress and say "ah".
- Radar?
- Huh?
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.
Everybody says you're a virgin.
Is that true?
I really don't know.
This guy's a one-star general, Patient's in pain.
Guess what his orders were.
"Give him a coffee enema".
Oh, my word.
Then I had to open my big mouth and say, "With cream and sugar"?
You're kidding.
He was afraid he'd get the wrong color blood?
Damn fool.
I was on a plane for Korea in 12 hours.
I mean, I should've done it.
The coffee was already brewed.
I mean, what would it have cost me, huh?
Well, the enema's loss was our gain, Colonel.
Why don't we pay Condon that's his name a little nocturnal visit?
Nothing violent, just a bit of reverse prejudice.
Capital idea.
- A hernia?
No, it doesn't hurt at all.
- Honest?
- Snip, snip; it's over.
- Ooh.
I understand you're in need of a medical man here.
- I see you couldn't find one.
- Where's Condon?
Number nine, with the bedpan marked "for whites only".
- Got the magic mixture?
- Yes, Master.
Right this way, Igor.
I will show you.
Oh, terrific.
- Still sedated?
- Just enough.
- Cotton.
- Cotton.
Somebody's gotta pick the cotton.
- What'd you use?
- Tincture of iodine.
Should last a couple of days.
- Perfecto.
- Mind if I dab along?
You do his hands.
Coming to you from the mess tent now.
Not a bad place to eat if you like cold dishes like steak, lamb chops, stew, soup, coffee.
Makes you long for home, but then, almost everything does.
Which brings me to Colonel Henry Blake.
He's a lovely man, our Henry, but if this weren't a war, he'd surely be arrested for impersonating an officer.
- How are we coming, Radar?
- Almost, sir.
- You know how to work that gizmo?
- Oh, yes, sir.
You feed the leader through and hook it on the old take-up reel.
Glad you know how.
I was never very good with my hands.
Guess that's why you became a surgeon, huh, sir?
- Very funny, Radar.
- Thank you, sir.
- Given up your plans to become sergeant?
- No, sir.
- Hi, Henry.
-  Hi.
- There you go.
- What's this?
What's happening?
- Dirty movies in the middle of the day?
- Sit down.
None of your sass.
Whatever you say, Henry.
It's your theater.
What are you showing?
Oh, the wife sent some film one of my kid's birthday parties.
- Hey, that's great.
- Help yourself to a drink.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, we will.
- Anytime, Radar.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Keep your hands to yourself, Trapper.
That's Molly at the head of the table.
-  She's adorable, Henry.
-  Real beauty.
-  Yeah, she's pretty, sir.
- Just like her mother.
- Bright as a penny.
- Didn't she get anything from you?
I'm her boyfriend.
-  -  Hey.
-  -  Steady.
That's the missus.
-  She's all right, Henry.
-  All right?
She was Succotash Queen at Illinois Normal.
- How did you bag her, Henry?
- Slip her something in her succotash?
I met her at a freshman mixer.
She was with Buzz Wilensky, captain of the football team.
Big, handsome son of a gun, Buzz.
She took one look in my direction  And?
And I begged her to go out with me.
Proposed to her on the first date, right there on the ice.
You really beat old Buzz's time, huh?
He went on to become the biggest cement contractor in the Midwest.
Saved her from a life of prosperity, right, Henry?
Henry, if you don't give the command to cry, I will.
Wow.
- Turn it off, Radar.
-  Yes, sir.
Hey, wait a minute.
Hold it, Henry.
-  Now the dirty movie.
-  For Pete's sake.
Why did Lorraine tack that on?
Ah, terrific, Henry.
He actually hit the ground the first time.
Got my shoes wet too.
- Look at this!
-  Aw, that's embarrassing.
-  Great legs.
-  You've been here too long.
Uh, that's Molly.
She must've been about three.
That's MiltJaffe, the gynecologist next door.
Oh, that's handy.
Everybody should have a gynecologist next door.
I'm afraid to ask what's on the other side.
-  Ohh.
-  Yeah.
Hey, hey.
Boy, that Sylvia Jaffe is loaded for bear.
Oh, wow.
- I could see that all over again.
- Mm.
Why not?
- Radar?
- Uh, yes, sir.
- That was very touching, Henry.
- Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
Tell me one thing.
Did you and Milt ever get married?
- Radar, how are you doing?
- Uh, in a minute, sir.
We've just heard Gen.
Eisenhower is running for president.
What some guys won't do to get out of the army.
Some people make it work for them.
They keep in good physical shape.
Others occupy themselves with painting, finding enjoyment in adding color to all our lives.
Then there are those devotees of exotic cultures who nightly practice their khaki fertility rites.
Knock, knock!
Anybody home?
Hello, Frank.
Here we are again.
Frank, don't nibble on me while I'm reading.
- I want to turn a page.
- Good.
I'll wet your finger.
Here.
Turn a whole lot of pages.
Ohh, Frank, be honest.
Do you really think of me as a bag of desirable bones?
- Of course, Margaret.
- I have a mind and a brain.
Of course you do.
Let me kiss your brain.
Frank, leave, and don't slam the door.
If I want aggravation, all I have to do is open one of my wife's letters.
I am sick to death of being reminded that you're a married man!
How do you think I feel?
It's not my fault I'm married.
She trapped me.
- Ha!
I'll bet.
- She did.
She did so.
She said she liked me.
- And that trapped you?
- You should've seen my skin in college.
I only became a doctor to clear up my face.
Take your face and your married face and get out!
Avec plaisir, Miss Snake-in-the-Grass.
You should talk, you two-timing four-flusher!
- Oh, Frank.
- Oh, Margaret.
Oh!
- Uh, excuse me, uh, Doc - Not now, soldier.
I'm due in O.R. There are a lot of ward people here.
- Uh, hey, miss - Yes?
- What's your problem?
- Let me ask you something.
- Did you see me when I first came here?
- Yeah.
Well, am I darker now than I was then?
I see what you mean.
Are you sure they gave you the right blood?
Huh?
It's happened before.
They got you down as "white".
Good work, baby.
- What the hell are you talkin' about?
- Relax.
I won't give you away.
- Get outta here!
- I'm a lieutenant, soldier.
I don't care if you are passing.
Watch your mouth.
At the London Zoo every day at 4:00, they have what's known as the "Chimps' Tea Party".
The MASH equivalent is our monthly staff meeting.
The Pentagon says it's necessary, but the meetings we have could prolong the war by at least two years.
Radar, will you call the roll, please?
- Henry, we all know who's here.
- Regulations require it.
Well, I can see that.
It could be that some of us aren't all here.
Take the roll.
If somebody's not here, he's probably someplace else.
The record should show it.
Unless the person making the record isn't here.
Thank you, Pierce.
- Radar?
- Here, sir.
- Take the roll.
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Uh, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake.
- Yo.
- Major Margaret Houlihan.
- Here.
- Major Frank Marion Burns.
-  - "Marion".
- His folks wanted a boy.
- I'm not in the mood for fooling around.
- You hear that, Margaret?
Captain John F.X. Mclntyre.
Wait.
We didn't hear Frank's answer.
We don't know if he's here.
- Of course I'm here.
- Regulations, Frank.
- Radar.
- Here, sir.
- No.
Ask Frank over there if he's here.
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Major Frank Burns?
- Here.
- Captain John F.X. Mclntyre.
-  Yo.
- Uh, Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce.
- Yo-yo.
First Lieutenant John Patrick Mulcahy.
- Here.
Bless this meeting.
- And all those who sail in her.
- Radar, will you read the minutes?
- Uh, sir?
It happens it isn't your turn to chair the meeting.
We go on a rotation basis.
By golly, that's right.
Okay, Radar.
Who chaired the last staff meeting?
- Uh, I did, sir.
- Hmm?
None of you showed up.
But the one before that, Major Burns did.
And that makes it Major Houlihan's turn.
Right.
Major Houlihan, it's your turn to chair the table.
- I'll take your seat, you take mine.
- Fine.
Let it go.
Sorry, Burns.
- Um - Yeah, here's your gavel.
Well, now, as chair of the month, I hereby call this staff meeting to order.
- You wanna re-bless the meeting, Father?
-  We will now hear the minutes of the last meeting, Corporal.
Uh, I didn't take any.
I was the only one here.
Excuse me.
We do have the minutes for the meeting before the last meeting.
- Read them, Corporal.
- Yes, ma'am.
"Minutes of the last monthly staff meeting, which was held six months ago.
"The motion was made that the officers of this unit hold a yearly reunion "once a year after the war is over.
"The motion was defeated when it failed to receive even one vote.
"The meeting was declared a shambles right after Captain Mclntyre unscrewed Major Burns's clusters".
Ah, those were the days.
The purpose of these meetings is to exchange information and ideas for the efficient military performance of this unit.
The continued abuse of this forum by certain of the staff only reinforces my low opinion of them.
Frank?
You know, in this light, you look just likeJoan Crawford.
-  Colonel Blake!
- Here, sir!
- Capt.
Pierce is out of order.
- I thought you're guaranteed for a year.
-  - Order!
Look, you wanna meet and talk about vein grafts and arterial surgery or trauma or cardiac arrest, I'll be as serious as you want.
But if we're here for the purpose of improving our military efficiency, I couldn't care less whether the border rocks are painted red, white or blue or whether we form a committee to study camouflaging our latrines.
Or to take Frank's suggestion of having lifeboat drills in case we're attacked by the Korean navy, which they don't even have.
- Really?
- Everything we say concerns the war!
Fine.
I make a motion that the war be ended.
I second the motion.
- You can't end the war just like that!
- Of course you can!
- There's a motion.
Let's vote on it.
- You've all heard the motion.
- Those in favor, raise your right hands.
- Aye!
- Those opposed?
- Nay!
The ayes have it.
Let it be recorded that the war was ended on this date at 9:32 p.m. Last man to the unemployment office is a rotten egg.
- Hiya, boy.
Ready for a little lunch?
- I gotta talk to you, Doc.
Why don't you have some food first?
Best medicine in the world.
- What is it?
- Just what you ordered.
Fried chicken and watermelon.
I never ordered that!
What are you guys tryin' to do to me?
- Did you give me the wrong color blood?
- All blood is the same.
- You ever hear of Dr. Charles Drew?
- Who's that?
Dr. Drew invented the process of separating blood so it can be stored.
- Plasma.
- He died last April in a car accident.
He bled to death.
The hospital wouldn't let him in.
It was for whites only.
See ya, fella.
- ##  -  How far away it all seems: Fun, affection, tenderness.
More later, Dad.
It's time to go on the night shift.
Well, Dad, another day, another happy hour.
Not too much.
I'm praying later.
Look, I'm your commanding officer.
I can promote you in the field, or we can go back to my place.
Doc?
I gotta join my outfit.
I just wanna thank you for patchin' me up.
No charge.
And also for giving me a lot to think about.
Lieutenant.
Good luck.
One of the happier happy hours, Dad.
Excuse me.
Come on over.
I want you to meet my friend.
Hawk, this is Nurse Anna Lindstrom.
- Oh, hey.
- She's with the Swedish unit.
- I thought you two might hit it off.
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- All right.
- Have a seat.
I'll get you a drink.
# So don't forget, folks # #That's what you get, folks # # For makin' whoopee ## What is that?
"Whoopee"?
I'll be with you in a minute, darling.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Hi, Mom.
I'm home.
- Washing socks?
- I've got to.
I left 'em out for the elves to do last night.
The wouldn't touch 'em.
Can you blame them?
You do lovely work.
I think I'm getting bedpan hands.
- Is your cold better?
- Does a cold ever get better?
You're shaving in the middle of the week.
Anybody I know?
- Lieutenant Marquette.
- Oh, the new one.
You're very observant for a laundress.
I never met a nurse that didn't register.
- Get it?
A registered nurse?
- Oh, a registered nurse.
-  - We're going on a picnic.
I'm gonna show her the beauty of Korea among other natural wonders.
These socks are dripping all over the floor.
It settles the dust.
I'll do yours for five dollars, Frank.
He doesn't wash his socks.
He wears them for a month, then burns them.
- Will you put that away, Frank!
- I'm cleaning it!
Playing with a gun, Frank, is very significant.
Highly Freudian.
Or am I guilty of pistol envy?
I don't put any stock in that Freud stuff.
Oh, you might have been one of his original patients, Frank.
Oh, phooey.
I can just see you walking through the Vienna woods kissing a loaf of freshly-baked bread.
"Come with me to the laboratory, young man; I give you strudel".
I happen to think that man is more than just an animal whose every thought is motivated by sex.
Well, there goes Hot Lips's evening.
Will you stop pointing that thing!
The safety's on!
I think.
Now it is.
Frank, I know it's irrational to ask you a rational question, but why do you need a gun?
We are in a battle zone, mister.
Only three miles from the front.
You must have very long bullets.
- Hey, Hawkeye?
- Yeah?
- I got the stuff for your picnic.
- Oh, faithful Radar.
When I have the time, I'll make you tall.
What culinary delights did you get for us this time, old family container?
- You've got breaded veal sandwiches.
- Good.
- With yesterday's lettuce.
- And tomorrow's bananas.
And neither is what it was or is going to be.
Get the tomatoes?
- No.
- Why not?
Uh, well, I looked at 'em, and something looked back.
Thanks.
Brandy.
Compliments of Colonel Blake.
- Not very much in it.
- He wasn't very complimentary.
- Fill it up.
- Huh?
- Take some white brandy.
- Oh, right.
- You can't use him as a servant.
- No servitude involved.
- He likes me.
Don't you, Radar?
- Uh, yes, sir.
And you don't like Major Burns, do you?
Oh, no, that's not so.
I like you, sir.
Why do you always say nasty things about him behind his back?
Hey!
Boy!
Honestly, sometimes!
Geez!
Well, I'm off.
Don't wait up for me.
Frank, if you don't put that gun away, I'm gonna break it into little pieces and feed it to you intravenously.
Are you aware that you're talking to an officer of superior rank?
- Yes.
- Oh.
See you later, Trap.
Make notes.
It's hard to accept.
Here it's so peaceful, idyllic.
And right over there is a war.
I feel almost guilty.
Ah, these moments are necessary.
Not something we owe ourselves; something we owe them.
I feel better.
And it's only just begun.
Is that all right, Frank?
Eight cans, eight shots.
That should be about right.
- Could I see the gun just once more?
- You've seen it, Margaret.
There's just something about a pearl-handled pistol that makes me Did I tell you my father had one?
No, I couldn't.
I just remembered that.
Isn't that curious, Frank?
And exciting somehow.
Well, yes.
Does every new nurse fall in love with you here?
No.
Only the ones with taste.
Do you think I have any?
I don't know.
Let me taste you.
-  - What was that?
You wait here.
Keep down.
Frank!
You idiot!
You know how close you came with that?
- Came with what?
I haven't fired yet!
- I was right over there!
- The bullet came within this close!
- I haven't fired yet!
- Don't lie!
- He most certainly has not!
Give it to me, Frank.
We'll give you a yo-yo or a doll that wets.
- No!
-  - What was that?
- A sniper!
Sniper!
The war!
Remember?
- Where are you going?
- Grab a friend and get back to camp!
##       Those are shots, aren't they, Radar?
- We're under fire, sir!
- Well, hell's bells!
We're a hospital.
That's against the Geneva Convention.
I'm not for it either, sir.
We're completely unarmed.
Sitting here with our tails sticking out, helpless.
Radar, psst, come here.
- Call Headquarters and get some help.
- I'll call and get some help.
- Radar, it's not very safe out there.
-  It's not much better in here, sir.
- What happened?
-  Oh, nothing.
I forgot my glasses.
Uh, I could go out there again if you wanted to volunteer me.
Oh, forget it.
You'd look silly with a hole in your head.
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.
You!
You out there!
Do you hear me?
This is Lt.
Col.
Henry Blake!
Do you hear me?
That son of a gun hears pretty good.
- Can I have it quiet in here, please?
-  - Uh people?
-  Quiet!
Shhh.
Quiet!
The major has something to say!
Quiet!
Uh, quiet, please, please!
May I have your attention?
-  - Now, please, I want it quiet!
-  - People!
I don't know.
I've always had it.
All right, people.
I want everybody calm.
Completely calm.
And that's an order!
- Now we're under -   We're under massive enemy attack!
Col.
Blake, our commander, is missing in action.
He's trapped in the shower with Radar.
What a way to go.
Well, in that case, I'm assuming command until the colonel can be, uh, "deshowerized".
It's like the Titanic in there without an orchestra.
I think there's only one, but I don't know.
There may be more.
What difference does it make?
You want us to go after him with our diplomas?
-  - Look, we need help!
Ye-Yeah, I realize that.
If there's a push on, there's gonna be wounded.
A-A-And we're pinned down!
We can't move!
Yeah, okay, okay.
Yeah.
We do the best we can.
There's a push on.
Tomorrow noon's the earliest they can get here.
What?
Oh!
- Thank God.
- Oh, congratulations.
You're alive.
- Are you all right?
- Barely.
He's really peppering away.
We've been pinned down in the shower.
That's the cleanest you've been since it rained.
What's the situation in here?
Desperate, Colonel.
No food, no ammunition.
- Low on supplies, low on morale.
- But very high on panic.
- Frank's been a marvelous commandant.
- He's risen to a new low.
You got casualties out there, son?
Yes, sir.
Six.
And some of them look pretty bad.
- Mclntyre, check his arm.
- Come on.
Colonel, we've got to get them in here.
Major, I may not know the difference between a bayonet and a butter knife, but I do know that!
- I hate to, but I've made a decision.
- Another first.
I'm gonna call Headquarters for immediate help.
Henry, we did.
We're on our own till tomorrow.
We can't just wait!
We've gotta do something!
Anything!
I agree with Frank.
I think we should do anything.
I agree with Frank.
I think we should do anything.
The first thing we have to do before we do anything is to get the casualties out there in here.
- Got any ideas?
- Isn't it obvious what we have to do?
- What?
- Surrender.
- Surrender?
- What?
There are wounded out there.
If we surrender, maybe we can help them.
Surrender?
Surrender and be overrun by those yellow hordes?
Overrun by a horde of one?
There may be a squad of them out there!
The minute you surrender, they infiltrate and crawl into your perimeter.
- Frank, there are ladies here.
- Colonel, if we are overrun, may I remind you of your responsibility for the women of this command?
What guarantee do we have concerning the violations of our bodies the possibly numerous, multiple violations of our bodies by the enemy?
What kind of guarantee do you want?
- That remark is beneath notice!
- Don't notice it.
Now, hold it, look.
I can't surrender without orders.
I mean, they emphasized that to me particularly.
I don't know exactly why.
I mean, the guy said, "Blake, never surrender without checking".
Besides, Headquarters says there's a push on.
All the more reason not to surrender!
Au contraire, Major!
There are choppers gonna be flying wounded in here looking for the 4077 th.
If we surrender, there's a chance we can keep working.
Otherwise, we're just sitting here with our majors hanging out.
- Colonel, may I go on record - No!
- Radar?
- Get a white flag.
Yes, sir.
Okay for now.
Wave it, wave it.
Okay, start unloading!
Let's go!
Move!
I hope he likes a parade.
-  -  Let's go!
Let's get these patients prepped!
Let's go!
Hurry it up!
Come on!
All right, hold it, hold it!
Whew.
You okay?
- Fine.
You?
- Okay.
- I don't know about you, but I'm upset.
- Yeah?
Why?
My draft board promised me there wouldn't be any shooting.
Hey, holy moley!
Look at this kid's gall bladder.
I got a weak stomach, Henry.
That's why I didn't go into medicine.
- Come on, sponge.
- Well, Pierce, maybe now you'll understand you can't do business with the commies.
How would you like your eyebrows plucked from inside?
Just where did your appeasement get us?
The sniper's still outside.
The generator's shot.
Yeah, but the wounded are in.
Stop yapping and work.
How they hate you for your courage.
Kid's not over 16.
Still got baby fat.
What is this, a children's war?
It's everybody's war, Pierce.
- You can have my share.
- You selling bonds again, Frank?
It's a little late in the game for pacifism, gentlemen.
You just don't quit.
And what happens if we do quit and they roll right over us?
- You could roll over first.
- You're obscene!
I'm even better on the phone.
Give me some more light here.
This is eerie.
Sit a little closer.
It drives away the eeries.
Why do I feel safe here with you?
Search me.
I don't.
All things considered, I think things are running fairly smoothly.
Don't you think so, Radar?
The tension is unbearable.
And building, building.
Can't you feel it, Frank?
Can't you feel anything?
Definitely.
Apart from the sniper, don't you think things are running fairly smoothly?
Nobody's eaten in 13 hours, sir.
Yes, well, that coincides with how long we've gone without food.
I have this peculiar metabolism.
If I don't eat regularly, everything solid in my body turns to liquid.
My shoes are full of water.
They are not!
A real man if we had a real man in this outfit would be out there in the darkness with his gun putting an end to this tension.
I don't do very well at night.
Since when?
My optic adjustment to darkness is, uh, subnormal.
I don't see very well.
But I do, and may I say, Frank, that my eyes are wide open and seeing more than I care to.
- Margaret.
-  Relax, relax!
I'm not here for violation purposes.
Where's Frank?
It's his shift.
He's not here.
He's not here!
Frank?
Frank!
Come one step closer, and I'll blow your head off.
Frank, it's Hawkeye.
- Frank.
- Oh, hi!
- Hi, Frank.
What's new?
- Well, I, uh I was out hunting the sniper.
I was, really.
- Right.
- And then after a while, l Well Frank, even General Patton had his off days.
- Really?
- Oh, he had days you wouldn't believe.
Days when he just had to slap someone.
Do you know how long it took me to become a doctor?
- Do you?
- I thought the usual time.
Twice as long.
I flunked out of two med schools.
I thought of switching to male nurse, but I could never make hospital corners.
- Frank, you really don't have to - During my internship, the local undertaker used to send me Christmas presents and calendars.
But I made it.
Why should I throw all that away?
Let them send men that have nothing to lose.
Sure, Frank.
Sure.
Uh, Pierce?
What are you going to say to, uh If you're lucky, and if I'm lucky, I won't run into her.
- The mess tent.
- The sniper?
Quiet!
Come on.
Me?
He doesn't know we're out here, but we know he's in there.
- Gives us a good chance to catch him.
- Catch him?
Or he catches us.
Whichever way it works out.
Look, if you want to be a hero that much, you go.
Frank, you know what a hero is?
Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, he's somebody who's tired enough and cold enough and hungry enough not to give a damn.
I don't give a damn.
Come on.
Wait.
I'll come with you.
-  -  I got him!
I got him!
Stop shooting!
- You almost killed me!
- I didn't fire it!
I didn't!
Yes, I did.
I had to get something to eat!
You'd risk your life for a, a ketchup on rye?
With butter and lettuce!
-  - That was too close.
Wow!
You want to finish that sandwich here or in surgery?
But, General, you promised us help by noon.
Well, what time is it now?
Well, now, that's after noon, isn't it, sir?
I mean, isn't it 12 up until it gets to be noon, and then you start all that "hundred hours" stuff?
I wish the army would tell time like everybody else.
- I mean, no offense, sir, but this -  Wait.
Hold on a minute.
Hold Uh, the chopper's here, sir.
Yeah.
Uh, look, I'll call you back later.
What's that, General?
I can't hear you.
I can't What?
Look, I said I'd   You think they got him?
I think they got him and a half.
Holy It could be a trick.
He fired on our white flag, didn't he?
Let's fire on his!
Just spitballing.
I mean - Hey, Radar, you want to do me a favor?
- Yeah, I'll get your bag.
- You sure you know what you're doin'?
- Not really, no.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
See you.
If you knew how lucky you are to be getting this house call.
-  What's the word?
- He's gonna make it.
Oh, thanks, Radar.
I can use a little mother's milk.
Why was he shooting at us?
- He's just a kid, 16 or 17.
- Gee.
Interpreter said he got cut off from his outfit, half out of his mind.
Scared, cold, hungry.
You won't believe this.
He thought this was MacArthur's headquarters.
- Oh, that's pathetic.
- He still thinks so!
He went under thinking he was gonna be the most famous man in North Korea.
Seems a shame to disappoint him.
Be nice if MacArthur could pay him a bedside visit.
Where are you gonna get a MacArthur to show him, for Pete's sake?
- What's going on?
- You have returned.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Attention, all personnel.
Because of the epidemic, tonight's broken film, which has not arrived yet, is canceled.
A reminder from Colonel Blake: Due to the flu, kindly refrain from kissing anyone, unless absolutely necessary.
Come on, Trap.
See if you can bite the spoon.
Well, you eat it all, you can see the picture at the bottom of the bowl.
The Three Little Pigs in escrow.
Why do doctors always make such lousy patients?
If you were a patient, would you trust you?
Come on, now.
One for General MacArthur?
He hasn't had a thing.
Pierce-comma-Hawkeye.
Lieutenant Anderson.
Sheila.
- You look new.
- Only one owner.
- Oh, sense of humor.
-  Hey.
My nose has no teeth.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Lieutenant Anderson, this is Captain Mclntyre.
A doctor with the 24-hour flu, which is now in its third day.
Hi.
I wish we'd met when I was alive.
Come on, now.
One for Ward Bond?
Attention, all O.R. Personnel.
- Attention.
Incoming casualties.
- They're playing our announcement.
See if you can get him to eat something.
Otherwise, start him on I.V. If he makes a grab at you, let him.
He needs the exercise.
You'll be playing the violin again in no time.
You know, there's a good chance I may not catch that old devil flu.
- Oh?
- You have your own private immunity?
You're invulnerable to viral infections?
I breathe through my ears.
Pipe down, will you, Pierce?
It's like living in a wind tunnel, but it fools the germs hanging around my nose.
- You okay, Jacobs?
- I'll be all right, Doctor.
Ah, that's good.
- 'Cause I'm deathly ill.
-  What's the matter?
Stop doing Jolson and get to bed.
I'm fine.
Fine.
I'll be just fine.
Jacobs, put him to bed.
- Take the next one for yourself.
- I'm fine.
I'm just fine.
Put a screen in between your beds.
He's most dangerous when he's on his back.
Don't thank me until you get my bill.
The big, dumb strong ones always go first.
- Suction.
- Suction.
Getting ready to close.
Four-oh silk, and mop my forehead.
- Doctor, I just did.
- Don't argue with me.
Just do what I The lights - Doctor!
- Stay where you are.
Don't leave.
Father, give him a stool.
- Can you land the plane by yourself?
- I think so.
- All right.
Help Sheila.
- Gloves.
Nothing clever.
Just close and call me when you're finished.
- Right.
- Belly up to the instrument tray.
Give him some gloves here.
Left one first.
Four-oh silk on Keith needle.
- Deever retractor.
- What?
Deever retractor.
The curly thing with the curl.
Oh, oh.
A Deever retractor.
They do give them complicated names.
That's the cross we bear, Father.
- How's Frank?
- He's unconscious.
Saving lives at last.
Suction, Father.
Coming right up.
Father, since we're working together, is it all right if I call you Dad?
Look, General, I realize that flu is epidemic in the whole theater, but I'm all alone here.
I'm a humble captain.
Yeah, l Yes, I know I know I'm a capable young surgeon.
Let me add I have good prospects and I'm a great catch, but I'm not looking for a husband.
I need help here.
Just send me some hands.
Anybody.
Jack the Ripper.
Anybody who's good with a knife.
Wait General, I understand the problem.
When am I gonna get somebody here?
Days?
Uh Thank you, General.
You've been a big help.
Everything I said to him went in one star and out the other.
Well, anything I can do to help.
That's a nice offer, Radar, but unless you can graduate medical school in the next two hours, forget it.
I suppose you realize you're ranking surgeon now.
It's hard to believe I'm sitting in Henry Blake's chair.
This is the chair from which a thousand indecisions have been launched.
Yes, sir.
- Tell you what we're gonna do, Radar.
- Check the personnel directory.
Call Seoul, Tokyo, Okinawa and Pusan, see if we can get another surgeon that can come in here and help you.
- You put the words right into my mouth.
- Yes, sir.
Don't get fresh.
Come in.
Margaret!
I've done this often, but I never dare dream it.
Mind your tongue.
Frank's flat on his back.
I think we should follow his example.
Frank wants his Bible.
Where is it?
It's over there under his catalog from theJapanese sex shop.
He doesn't have one of those.
He's even making a shopping list.
You'll find the page creased under the inflatables section.
- Patch kits included.
- Be serious for just one minute, please.
I am, Margaret.
You know, there's a frontier feeling around here.
Joel McCrea is in bed.
So is Ralph Bellamy and Colonel Andy Devine.
Now there's just you and me Frances Dee and Slim Summerville.
Why do you talk like that?
I can't help it.
I'm part of the movie generation.
I spent every Saturday morning and afternoon in the dark.
I'm really not interested.
I could easily have been a mushroom instead of a doctor.
I'll tell you what you're not.
You're not Commanding Officer.
- Oh, yeah?
- As a major, I'm next in command.
Okay, you take charge.
You've just been waiting for a chance to take over, haven't you?
Look, I want a command about as much as I want a scholarship to Devil's Island.
Let's have a clear understanding.
You won't take yes for an answer, will you?
I'll get to the real thrust of what I'm saying.
You're the sorest winner I ever met.
You've emasculated me for the last time.
I'm in charge now.
Okay, Madame President.
You take care of the surgical matters, and I'll handle administration.
We'll be so busy we'll never see each other, darling.
After you, sir.
I suppose you're wondering why I asked you all here tonight.
Years ago, each of you did something terrible to me.
What are you talking about?
Nothing.
You're in charge.
You take over.
Don't be foolish.
I wouldn't presume to tell you anything about surgery.
All right, let's get organized.
Father.
You'll be working with Sheila.
This is a promising young surgeon who prays a lot.
Got a great touch, especially on Sunday.
All right.
- Okay, uh, scalpel.
- Scalpel.
- Kelly clamp.
- Kelly.
Okay, promising young surgeon, give me your hand.
All right, hold that down, right there.
You got it?
- Yes, I'm holding it.
- All right.
Don't let go of it.
All right.
There are no fragments.
- Irrigate the wound and pack it over.
- Yes, Doctor.
Margaret?
Over here.
Kelly, gloves.
You're really in charge here, Commander.
You'll work with Wilson.
You're so scared, I'd like to put my sterile arms around you.
- I'm okay.
- Okay.
Scalpel.
Scalpel.
I'll open up the paradidymal and see what we've got, or rather what he's got.
I'm ready.
That's what I tried to tell you when we were alone.
Okay, uh, Charlie, I'm in the M's now.
Uh, what about this guy: Martin, Robert H.?
He's listed as a chest cutter.
He's a pediatrician?
Uh, Charlie, we get very few pregnant soldiers.
- Pierce!
- Coming, Mother.
- Nice job.
That was good help.
- Thank you.
What's happening?
- I I'm not sure.
- That's perfect.
I've never done this before.
Bet you can't remember the first time you said that.
Just put a clamp on that other bleeder there.
Hawkeye, could I trouble you?
Coming, Father.
Okay, sponge.
Uh, hi.
Harry?
Uh, right.
Radar O'Reilly over at 4077 th?
Yeah, listen.
Has your outfit got a Dr. Anthony McDonald, General Surgeon?
Huh?
He changed to psychiatry?
That's crazy.
Is that really his gallbladder I'm holding?
It ain't his money belt, partner.
Hold it.
Ready to close now, Doctor.
I'll be right there.
Meantime, look for your wristwatch.
Surgeon's joke.
I don't feel well.
Would you be good enough to take this gallbladder off my hands?
- Okay.
Richardson retractor.
- Richardson.
-  Pierce!
- Just a second.
Hold that back, will you, Sheila?
Metzenbaum scissors.
- Metz.
- Hawkeye?
- Yeah?
What?
Any luck?
- No, I struck out.
I called Okinawa, Seoul, Tokyo.
Everybody's got the flu, or they won't come, or whatever.
We may have to close the war.
Clamp.
-  I'm out of clamps.
- Well, get some, quick.
Not you, Sheila.
Get back here.
Hold that.
Father, get us some clamps.
- We've got to close him now.
- Somebody get us I'll be right there.
- Wait a minute.
-  I've got to close him now.
Will you wait a minute?
-  - My kingdom for an intelligent octopus!
Hi, dear.
Having a tough day at the office?
Just filling out the daily report.
Add these.
Pints of blood used.
Pints of blood needed.
Progress of cases reports.
And on page six, you'll find my resignation.
If you skip every other word, you'll see it's also a suicide note.
Don't be facetious.
All right, then I'll go home as a deserter, in chains, anything.
- That will do, Captain.
- I don't care.
I'm getting out of here.
And I'm taking you with me, Margaret.
We'll send for Frank later.
Can I interest you in a little Have you examined the flu patients?
Frank's temp is up.
Henry's is down.
Trapper seems to be hovering between Sheila and Shirley.
He'll be able to play Saturday in the big game with Abnormal State.
I'm gonna sack out.
You want anything from me before I go?
I'm yours.
Well, I have something a bit more constructive.
A new serum.
It came in on the last chopper.
They think it might prevent the flu.
- It's experimental.
-  Classic army thinking: Locking the barn after the horse has the flu.
It may help.
We ought to immunize each other.
Margaret, another dream come true.
I think we ought to give each other injections.
I'm no good with a needle.
I never have been.
I can take it.
- Where do you want it?
- In my arm.
Party pooper.
- Ah!
- Told you I was lousy.
Maybe we are in a movie.
You're Bette Davis and I'm George Brent.
- You do me.
- Roll up your sleeve.
- Uh-uh.
- What do you mean, "uh-uh"?
I want mine in my tushy.
- You what?
- Derriere.
The back of my front.
The fleshy part.
I can't take pain.
I can only give it.
All right.
Lower your trousers.
I thought you'd never ask.
Only as far as you have to.
- You're just loving this, aren't you?
- Aren't you?
- Let me get at your hip.
- Anytime, darling.
Sir?
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Ow!
Margaret, that was fantastic.
Fine.
I hope you realize this means we're engaged.
I hope you realize this means we're engaged.
- Well.
- Henry.
Oh, Colonel.
Well, Mr. And Mrs. 4077 th at home, in my office.
- Should you be up?
- I'm just fine.
I'm perfect.
You look like an ad for death.
You know what kind of a bird moves into another bird's nest while the colonel bird is sick?
- Somebody had to take command.
- So you did it together.
That's double indemnity.
That's what that is.
I seen it in a movie.
- You're burning up.
Get back to bed.
- Oh, no, no, no.
So you two can just sit around my desk and smoke my cigars?
- She couldn't help it.
She was drunk.
- Oh, stop.
Well, forget it.
Just-Just get out of there, Mrs. Judas.
Yes, sir, I am back on the bridge.
I'm in command around here again.
He went down with his desk.
- Package, lady.
Where do you want it?
- Right there, Doctor.
Pierce, I'm fine.
Just fine.
All right, Henry, you just go to sleep and we'll leave a call for February.
Same treatment he was getting before he went over the wall.
- Right.
- Look at me, sick in Korea.
If I was back home in Bloomington, Illinois, my wife would be taking care of me.
She'd be leaning over my bed with her hair in curlers and cold cream on her face and those chipped fingernails.
The kids playing ball up against the side of the house, my dog at the foot of my bed having an accident.
Boy, am I glad I'm here.
What are you doing?
Unless I've got amnesia, this is how you dress, right?
You strong enough to get back in the game?
I think I'm getting better.
There's two of you there.
There used to be three.
Very good.
You can do double hernias.
Fever gone?
Mother used to kiss my forehead to find out.
We tried to reach your mother.
She doesn't make house calls.
You gotten any replacements?
We've been offered a veterinarian and a gynecologist.
Great.
They'll be helpful if we get a horse that's going through menopause.
- Been rough, huh?
- I've had more fun at autopsies.
Well, help is here.
Uh, Dr. Pierce, could you look at bed five?
If you'll look with me.
No, no, now, Frank, I don't think you should.
Well, Mclntyre's getting up.
You're sicker than he is.
Everybody knows that.
My nose feels like it weighs five pounds.
Oh!
Frank, I'm in command now.
I can get a lot of things changed the way we want them.
Oh, that's terrific, Louise.
Louise?
- That's your wife.
- Where?
Where?
Frank, we're in Korea.
Oh.
Oh, good.
She'll never find us.
Yes, Frank.
Yes.
Lie still.
I'm all right.
We're gonna have to get out of here.
Why?
Too many people in this motel.
- What's up?
- It isn't Trapper.
I'm with you, Hawk.
I can make it.
Fine.
All we have to do is move the floor into the operating room.
Let me alone.
I can stand.
Sure, if we screw you to the flagpole.
Look, Trap.
You wanna help me, don't help me.
The only way you're gonna get better is if you let yourself be sick.
I think I can manage that.
Hawkeye, chopper's on the way, loaded with casualties.
Hawkeye, chopper's on the way, loaded with casualties.
Fifteen minutes at the most.
All right, Father, get your tap shoes.
Sheila!
Margaret, let's go.
- Come on.
- I have to go now, but I'll be back.
Good-bye, Nancy.
Nancy?
You're the best receptionist I ever had.
- Frank!
- Honestly, Louise, we had to work late.
Double requisition everything.
We need whole blood.
Tap the kitchen staff and the Korean personnel.
I want a pint from everybody.
I gave this morning.
Can I give again?
It's too soon.
Anyway, your blood is nearsighted.
- Is that possible?
- Keep checking for doctors.
Nobody'll listen.
Tell them you're acting under the direct orders of General Clayton.
Just one moment, Captain!
- Radar, go.
- Stay!
- I said go!
- And I said stay!
She outranks you.
She's got more things on her uniform.
She's got more things in her uniform, but go.
Sorry, sir.
I thought we understood that I am administration.
Let me tell you something, administration.
You know that little shot you gave me for the flu?
- Yes?
- Well, it worked.
I've got it.
Are you sure?
I've got enough nausea to light up the city ofToledo, okay?
First I'm hot, then I'm cold.
And my knees are in business for themselves.
My tongue has gone cashmere, and I'd like to find an all-night latrine that takes servicemen.
Now, have I got the flu or am I just in love?
- Do you think you can operate?
- I've got to.
What am I gonna tell the casualties, to stop bleeding until I feel better?
I wanna see if you've got fever.
Believe me, I've got fever to burn.
I'm worried about you, Doctor.
You really are, aren't you?
You know all those rotten things I've said to you, all those nasty little tricks I've played on you?
Yes.
I'd like to get well and do them all over again.
Pickups.
Pickups.
How do you feel?
I have this terrific thirst for embalming fluid.
Are you gonna make it?
That's up to you, Margaret.
You're incredible.
As sick as you are, digging into someone's gut, and you still can proposition a nurse.
I've endowed a dirty old man to make a pass at you two years after I'm dead.
It's in my will.
- Okay.
You close the skin.
- Right.
Sorry.
How's it going, folks?
Bleeding's under control.
You look awful, Doctor.
I feel awful.
It's a set.
Saline solution for, uh, irrigation.
Get a retractor first.
Father, pull that back, will you?
Get the saline.
Pull it back more.
I can't see in there.
Can you get it back more?
Get some suction.
- Suction.
- All right, that's enough.
- Hawkeye?
Hawk?
- Get it back a little bit more.
It's okay, Hawk.
I got 28 pints of blood.
You're a good man, Tiny Tim.
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.
- You okay?
- Scrub up.
- Hmm?
- We need help.
Kelly, get him ready.
- Clamp.
- Wait a minute.
I can't operate.
- You're not.
You're gonna help.
- How's my fainting gonna help?
Scrub up!
All right, we're just about finished, Father.
- Is he all right?
- Better than I am.
Can you close or do you want me to get you started?
- I can do it.
- Hawkeye, was I all right?
All right?
I'm putting you in for the Distinguished Cross cross.
You're making a terrible mistake.
If we did nothing else, we got you to wash your hands.
Yes, sir.
Right this way, Doctor.
- How you doing?
- Okay.
I finished debreding the wound.
Hey.
You know, you're better than Frank.
But then so is the patient.
Radar, you'll be assisting Margaret Houlihan nurse, friend and all-around good egg.
He's very sick.
Okay, gang.
Ours not to question why.
- Mayo scissors.
- Mayo.
Let me have a clamp.
- A what?
- A clamp.
- Which one is a clamp?
- There.
- Metzenbaum scissors.
- Metz.
- Okay, let me have a scalpel now.
- Which one?
-  Attention.
- Be very careful.
Here is the latest news from Armed Forces Radio.
Stockholm Dr. Ralph Bunche has just won the Nobel Peace Prize.
Moscow Joseph Stalin announced he has been unanimously reelected ruler of Russia.
Paris French Army today predicted it would bring a swift end to the Vietnamese war.
Detroit the automobile industry reached its production target of six and a half million cars.
Koreaammunition and material shortages continue to hinder the Allied war effort.
Pierce, in recognition of your outstanding service and dedication and as a token of our admiration, uh, this scroll has been signed by every member of the 4077th.
That really hits me where I live.
Thanks.
Nice going, buddy.
I'll never be able to look at this without thinking of you, Frank.
- You were superb.
- Thanks, Chief.
All right, people, let's break it up.
I ordered bed rest for this patient.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Trapper?
Trapper?
I'm not going to talk unless you stop screaming.
I'm sorry.
I'll be better after I shave my tongue.
Does your head hurt?
From the ankles up.
Everything above that, I leave to science.
I think one of us should try breathing on a mirror.
Okay.
But do it quietly.
-  -  I need a doctor.
- You're a doctor.
- Then I'm the last thing I need.
Well, at least everybody cleaned up before they left.
You suppose we died and we've gone into the army?
Possible.
Who's that?
I don't know him, do I?
That's Dr. Klein.
Eye, ear, nose and guitar.
- Is he alive?
- Yes, but his guts are in bad shape.
- Shall we wake him?
- No.
Look what waking up did for us.
-  Morning, sirs.
- Ohh!
What a rotten thing to say.
Especially first thing in the morning.
- Wow!
- There were no survivors.
- Is that coffee?
- Oh, yeah, I figured you'd need some.
Gimme, gimme.
I'll take mine here.
- Is that Dr. Klein?
- It was.
We're gonna wake him so he can do an autopsy on himself later.
Oh.
Here's your cases for today.
Radar, I have the impression that we woke you about 3:30 this morning.
- No.
It was ten to 4:00.
- Did we say why?
Uh, you said you wanted to sacrifice a virgin.
- Did we?
- I was too sleepy.
- Frank?
- Hmm?
- No comment about this?
- About us?
Not today, Doctors.
I'm not playing.
You're not going to debauch all night, and then expect me to cleanse you with a tongue-lashing.
I'm not your mother.
- Aw, please, Frank.
- Come on, Mom.
Please.
- No.
- You have to.
How will we know what a good time we had unless you tell us how rotten we are?
It's senseless.
You continue to waste your off-hours in riotous living to the detriment of yourselves as doctors and people.
You know, he's right.
You know, you're right.
I don't have to take that from you.
We're on a treadmill.
Bandages and booze.
- And broads.
- Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
What happened to those two bright-eyed, bushy-tailed young surgeons I once knew?
Was that us?
We're going to get our tails bushed again.
Come on.
Let's make our rounds.
Twelve hours of I.V., then put a ticket on him to Tokyo.
Yes, Doctor.
Yesterday, remember?
Multiple chest.
Wish you were talking about a nurse.
Come on, bushy tail.
We got fever.
Nurse, give me an ice pack here.
Hiya, Rizzo.
How you doing?
My partner and I operated on you.
- Let's stop this fever stuff.
- You're gonna make us look like bums.
We don't need any help in that department.
He had a full course of penicillin.
He's not responding.
Let's take some blood cultures and see what kind of germ factory this kid is.
- Nurse?
- Where do you want the ice pack?
Take some blood cultures of Rizzo again.
Rizzo.
I did a white count on him.
What's the problem?
We don't know.
Complications.
Fever.
Okay.
I'll ship this off to the Tokyo lab.
We'll know what he has in 72 hours, then you can treat him.
Seventy-two hours?
The kid's so hot now, you can fry an egg on his head.
Why don't we have an incubator here so we can do our own tests?
Because it would save time and effort, and it would make sense.
Can't have any of that in the army.
All right.
Ship it right away.
Next chopper.
Mark it "soonest".
Trap.
Okeydokey!
I want you to secure legs "A," "B," "C" and "D" to the fire bowl.
Then I put rack "A" into slot "A," using washers 1, 2 and 3.
Now all we have to do is tighten her up and find our place for the spits And we got our own barbecue.
I tell ya, Radar, I gotta hand it to the U.S. Army, boy.
They take care of their own.
You know, sir, I have a friend down in the 331 st Evac.
He says that they just got a Hey, why don't we put in for one?
Well, most of the time it's freezing cold here, sir.
We could stock it with trout.
They're great barbecued.
Oh, yes, sir.
You gonna wanna use this tonight?
You betcha.
I want you to go see the cook.
He's still in the hospital, sir.
- Really?
- Captain Pierce said, he oughta be on a food-free diet.
Well, then go see whoever's in charge.
I want a couple of steaks about yea big.
I'm going to put those babies on tonight.
Just show 'em the fire.
I like my steaks rare.
Yes, sir.
They gotta scream when you cut into 'em.
I fix 'em my own way.
Sprinkle sugar and pour brandy on 'em.
Uh-huh.
- Got a minute, Henry?
- Look at this, guys.
Our own barbecue.
I'll show you amateurs how to put on a party.
We're through with parties for a while, Henry.
Well, you'll never top last night.
That was a real wingding.
I'd have bet anything you couldn't get four people inside a sleeping bag.
Henry, we're going back into medicine.
You wanna join us?
- Come again?
- Our lab needs an incubator.
Yeah.
We could speed up diagnoses and treatment by days.
Well, hell!
We just got the barbecue.
I can't pester them for an incubator.
Tell them we decided to open up a hospital instead of a restaurant.
- How do we requisition an incubator?
- Now just hold it!
I'm sick and tired of you guys going over my head down to Radar!
- Oh, I don't mind, sir.
- Well, I do!
Now, look, this little fella's got plenty of work to do without you guys heaping more responsibility on him.
- Go get those steaks, Radar.
- Yes, sir.
Henry, we got a patient with an infection we can't identify.
- All because we don't have an incubator.
- All right, that's a point.
Make a note of it, put it in my in-basket, and I'll get right on it.
Leaving an idea with you is like abandoning a baby in a garbage can.
Now, that's unfair.
I do plenty around here every day.
I just don't make a lot of noise about it.
Yeah, you're one of those quiet sleepers.
- What about the incubator?
- We need it.
Those things cost five or six hundred dollars.
The war's been running for two years.
The government must be showing a profit by now.
All right, all right.
Let's get one.
Now, that's the Henry we all sing about around the campfire.
- Radar!
- Radar!
- Colonel Blake?
- Yo.
Captain Sloan from Quartermaster Corps here to see you, sir.
- Colonel.
- Captain.
Radar, would you Captains Pierce and Mclntyre are on their way, sir.
Fine, fine.
Just so long as they know I want to see them before they get here.
- Yes, sir.
- Sit down, sit down.
- Care for a drink?
- Never touch it.
- Ah.
Smoke?
- No, thank you.
Well, that only leaves sex.
Afraid we can't help you there.
Say, you guys in Quartermaster are doing a bang-up job.
I mean, everybody seems to have plenty of guns and bullets and stuff.
Wouldn't be much of a war without you.
We hold our end up.
You do that around here, you get your temperature taken.
Oh, Captain Sloan, these are Captain Pierce - And these are Captain Mclntyre.
- Hi.
How about a snort, Henry?
- Hey, we took the pledge, remember?
- Oh.
- B.T. - B.T.?
Bushy tail.
Surgeons.
Captain Sloan here is with Supply.
More accurately, I'm with the 375th Q. M.H.Q., COMSEAPAC, SEOULSEC REPDEP.
Maybe I'll have that drink.
The business at hand is an incubator, that is if my Lieutenant understood what your colonel said you captains want.
- Right.
- And we need one as soon as possible.
- Let's see what the good book says.
- The good book?
The Manual of Supply and Requisition.
MANSUPREQ.
Um, "inhalator, indicator, innoculator, infusilator" Here it is: 437-stroke-R2, incubator.
Thar she blows!
"Device for developing bacterial cultures at constant suitable temperatures".
Uh-huh.
I see.
That certainly makes sense.
You can't have one.
- Beg your pardon?
- I checked your basic equipment list.
This unit has everything it's supposed to have.
You're not entitled to an incubator.
That would be a a luxury.
- Luxury?
- We're not asking for a pizza oven.
- Oh, that I can let you have.
- No kidding!
Hey, that would be great on movie nights.
You got any pizza requisition forms?
Just use the standard S-1798 and write in "pizza" where it says "machine gun".
- Captain, are you saying no?
- It's my job to say no.
You do it very well.
I imagine you'll open up a "no" stand after the war.
You ever been in a hospital and your doctors didn't know what to do for you?
-  - I've never had a sick day in my life.
Was that your own idea or an order?
Can the snottiness, Pierce.
Man's only trying to do his job.
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Sorry, Captain.
"Thank you, Colonel.
Sorry, Captain.
Sorry, patient.
"You have a temperature of a 109-stroke-10.
"You can't have an incubator, but you can have a pizza with everything to go.
Unless, of course, you go first".
Let's stay on the ground, shall we, Pierce?
Does the book allow us any ground, Captain?
Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you all to take a step up.
- Into limbo.
- No, you can't have any limbo.
In fact, you can't have anything-stroke-nothing, which is not approved by STATQUOPAC.
Which is enough to make you reach for Al RSICKBAG.
Just hold it, Pierce!
Captain, I'd like to formally apologize for the 4077 th.
Have you got any apology forms in there?
We're gonna get that incubator.
We're gonna go forth and part the red tape.
I'll drink to that.
- Will Scotch be all right, sir?
- Yeah, fine, Radar.
Perfect.
I ran out of ice, sir, so I used bourbon.
Radar, I want you to get on the pipe and find us an incubator.
Don't stop until you locate one.
- Is that an order, sir?
- Sure sounded like one to me.
Well, everybody, happy days.
Stroke, cheers.
- I'm going to resect this intestine.
- I'm with you.
- Number ten blade.
- Anything that wiggles is my fingers.
- Number ten.
- I think it's safer with Frank, Henry, if you hold his knife still and move the patient back and forth.
I'm doing just fine!
Colonel Blake?
Show it to Pierce.
- Doctor?
From Radar.
- Yes.
Can I see the X-ray?
A little higher.
Hey, terrific.
He's located an incubator.
Three of them at the 728th Evac in Pusan.
A Major Arnold Morris.
- Jackpot.
- Three cherries straight across.
Thanks.
Aw, jeepers.
Whew!
Guess where we're going after surgery, Henry.
Oh?
Without my permission?
- Don't we have it?
- Of course you do.
You think I'd let you leave without my permission?
- Ha!
An incubator.
- Three.
May I remind you both that not everybody you'll meet down there is going to be lovable Colonel Henry Blake.
What are you trying to tell us, lovable Colonel Henry Blake?
Take my advice.
Don't show up looking like freelance abortionists.
Shape up.
Good thinking, Henry.
I'll wear my pinks.
How about you, Mary?
Can we cut the gab in here?
Aw, look at that.
"Maintains temperature at a constant 37 degrees centigrade".
The army guarantees it for a year or two wars, whichever comes first.
Just think of the germs we can hatch in that.
Makes your mouth water.
- And it's never been used.
- These are still in their crates.
And they're gonna stay that way.
I'm Major Morris.
- Captain Pierce.
- Mclntyre.
4077 MASH - You want an incubator.
No dice.
- But you've got three.
That's right.
If I give one away, I'll only have two.
- What's wrong with two?
- Two is not as good as three.
- But you're not even using them.
- Who says I have to?
- What do you do when you want a culture?
- I send a smear to Tokyo.
If I use one of these and it breaks down, then I'll only have two.
- That's a sick attitude.
- Well, they're mine.
Just lend us one.
Anytime you want, you can come over and borrow a cup of germs.
You guys rich, young draftee doctors all dressed up like drum majorettes.
Rich?
Some of my patients pay me in kittens.
I never made more than $10,000 a year in my life.
I was a pediatrician in a women's prison.
Well, look, Major, we're not here from True Confessions.
You're not here for no incubator neither.
What's mine is mine.
- But in triplicate?
- He's a three-lane schizophrenic.
Say, you know, I think I know how we can solve this problem.
Why don't you guys just salute and get the hell on out of here?
Who's your commanding officer?
Colonel Lambert is commanding officer of this base.
- Where would we find him?
- Nowhere on the base, that's for sure.
- Got his own house?
- He's got two of them.
One blonde and one brunette.
We've gotten nothing but static so far, Colonel.
First from a supply captain who won't tie his shoe without a direct order.
Then from a Major Morris, who, in civilian life, - is known as Leopold and Loeb.
- All we want is an incubator.
For the simple purpose of practicing better and more efficient medicine.
Sir, I appeal to your sense of what's right.
They're full of it.
That'll be all for now.
I think we'll have lavender in the bath this afternoon, my dear.
Okay, Daddy.
- Now, gentlemen, an incubator.
- Yes, sir.
Were you interested in just the one?
Yes, Colonel.
If I'm not mistaken, that lists for 627.50, F.O.B., Inchon.
Freight, handling, re-stenciling.
An even thousand should handle it.
- A thousand dollars?
- Cash.
Ah!
Preparing a little doggie bag for Switzerland, Colonel?
That was a perfect diagnosis, Doctor.
Wait a minute.
You sell incubators?
Oh, yes.
Sterilizers, ice cream makers, pontoon bridges, jeeps, and, with a week's notice, the odd B-52.
The crew is extra, of course.
If you're looking for a real bargain, I can let you have a half-million rolls of toilet paper, which I happen to be sitting on.
- Bravo, Colonel.
- Thank you.
Have you ever thought of opening your own country?
- You're a thief!
- Of course.
Why should the sergeants have all the fun?
More tea?
Why don't you try one of these rice cookies?
How much?
I like you.
You have a nasty streak of morality.
But I like you.
I'm gonna let you have that incubator for $627, cost.
Plus ten percent for tolerance.
Colonel, unlike you, we're a nonprofit organization.
Our outfit is a bunch of little khaki church mice.
I'd like to help you.
Really, I should.
But if I started doing my duty, where would I wind up?
Well, Trap?
Onward and upward?
That would lead you to General Mitchell.
General Maynard M. Mitchell.
Honest, true-blue as the day is long and about as interesting as a five-pound bag of fertilizer.
Ladies and gentlemen, General Mitchell will now answer your questions.
Thank you.
Uh, Mr. Bowman.
General, today's news handout contains casualty figures and bomb tonnage.
Is there anything you can add?
No.
Only I would add that there's nothing to add.
General, what can you tell us about the rumored peace talks?
I'm glad you brought that up, and I want to caution you all the press here that irresponsible leaks in this area may lead this war to a premature peace.
General, can you tell us why MASH units never get any incubators?
Our people have this question under scrutiny at the moment.
Now, if this scrutinization should yield negative, then I feel that we must maximize our efforts.
Next.
Sir, I don't want to minimize your maximize, but why aren't field hospitals properly supplied with incubators?
Hospitals which surprisingly attract a great number of wounded people.
That question has a lot of buckshot in it.
I'm sure the answer will too.
Let me say this.
The United States Army is the best equipped fighting force since the Roman legions crossed into Spain, each man carrying his mess kit full of gazpacho.
Let's move on.
I think we've let enough fresh air into this incubator picture.
In any case, I wouldn't want to dwell on it for - Security reasons.
- Exactly.
- You have a question?
- Yes, I do.
Why don't you answer his question?
- Are you two together?
- In all kinds of weather.
- Are you reporters?
- We're doctors.
With a MASH unit.
The ones that don't have incubators.
Identify yourselves.
Captain John Mclntyre, 4077 th MASH.
So am I, except I'm Captain Pierce.
- Who's your commanding officer?
- We'd rather not say.
He'd like to go through the war anonymously.
I wonder if you doctors understand going through channels, militarywise-speaking.
Sir, we started with a captain, went on to a major, then to a colonel.
On the way, we've encountered oral compulsiveness, raging paranoia and a colonel who's shipping Korea to Switzerland one dollar at a time.
Which makes you the next contestant, General.
And the subject you've chosen is incubators.
- And we need one.
- What about this incubator situation?
- What was the name of that colonel?
- Now just a minute!
This is a press conference!
The last thing I want to do is answer questions!
- What exactly is an incubator?
- It grows germs.
General, are we involved in germ warfare?
- That's a lie!
-  Holy cow!
Insubordination, conduct unbecoming officers, violations of Articles 13 through 27 with a repeat on 26.
Oh, that must be "altering salute by placing thumb on nose".
Henry, there's something you should know about those charges.
Yes.
We're guilty.
I'll tell you what else you are: You're under arrest.
- General's orders.
- Swell.
What do we tell the casualties?
We only operate on visiting days?
You gonna lock us up, Sheriff?
If you guy didn't outclass every bit of surgical talent in Korea, your tails would have been in handcuffs a long time ago.
Henry, it's no crime for doctors to try to get decent medical equipment.
Did you really yell, "Give me an incubator or give me death"?
Well, it doesn't sound like anything now.
Yeah.
You had to be there.
Now, look, what the general doesn't understand is, I can't take you guys out of action.
I've got to do something to punish you.
So I'll leave it to you.
Wh-What's a suitable punishment?
Why don't you try spending a lot of time with us, Henry?
Maybe that's where we went wrong.
You know how a kid misses his dad.
A marine company has been trying to take hill 19 again.
You guys better suit up.
Let's hope nobody needs a sample sent to Tokyo.
Wow.
Did you really call a one-star general a "NI NCOMPAC"?
- Hey, sirs?
No, wait, look.
- Not now, Radar.
Ta-da!
-  - Hey!
- Happy germs, sir.
- Radar, how?
A little wheeling and dealing, a little horse-trading.
A little of this for that.
And we went all the way up to a general.
And a little corporal shall lead them.
You just gotta learn to start at the top.
Uh, sir?
We do have just a little bit of a problem here.
- What?
- Well, he wants steak for tonight.
- Barbecued.
- So?
Can you set this thing for rare?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Welcome to the 4077 th, Major Freedman.
The conference will start at 1800 hours, sharp.
I'll be there.
Oh, sir, if you'd like a drink, compliments of Colonel Blake.
Scotch, gin, vodka.
And for your convenience, all in the same bottle.
- Thank you, Corporal.
- Oh, you're welcome, sir.
The conference starts at 1800 hours, sir.
Good.
I can get in a little sack time.
Oh, yes, sir.
- Corporal.
- Sir?
Have a nurse wake me a little at a time.
Yes, sir.
How'd you get out of it?
I just sat her down and I said, "Honey, it'll never work.
You're too good for me".
- Was she?
- No, as a matter of fact, she wasn't very good at all.
- You have a lot of trouble with women, don't you?
- Every chance I can.
- Sponge.
- Sponge.
-  - Yeah?
I just wanted to remind you, sirs, that the conference is set for 1800 hours.
- How much is that in people time?
- 6:00.
Wow!
Hey, Radar, without your glasses you could almost pass for offensive.
Hey, why don't you leave the little fellow alone?
It's okay.
I can take a joke.
-  Hey!
- Wait a minute!
Where you going?
I was kidding!
- He's kidding!
- You're beautiful!
-  - Yo.
Sir, Major Freedman and Captain Pak have arrived and will be ready at 1800 hours.
Oh, that's terrific, Radar.
Cut yourself shaving, sir?
No, Radar.
I thought I'd wear three pieces of toilet paper tonight.
Maybe start a new trend.
- I don't think it'll catch on.
- That'll be all, Radar.
- Sir, could I ask a favor?
- Ask away.
- Can I use the jeep tonight?
- Oh?
Got a little action lined up tonight, Radar?
Well, me and a couple of guys are going down to the Purple Dragon.
It's supposed to be real nifty.
Oh, Radar, the Purple Dragon is a Lockheed bomber packing crate they emptied and stuck in a jukebox and a bunch of B-girls on roller skates.
Yeah.
I wouldn't touch one of those girls if I was a ten-foot pole.
- Uh, but, sir - Do you remember the training film you saw yesterday?
- Oh, don't worry about me, sir.
I know what to do.
- Uh-huh.
I'm not gonna get trench foot.
- Have a good time.
- Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen, I make it We're all assembled.
Let's begin.
Okay.
First ace deals.
Here we go.
Oops.
- Nice dealing, Henry.
- That's embarrassing.
- Did you cut those cards, Henry?
- Somebody ought to cut Henry.
Okeydoke, ante up.
How 'bout a little five-card stud?
Jake.
Three of clubs.
Deuce.
Lady.
Ooh.
And a big ace for the dealer.
Sorry about that.
- Bet a buck blind.
- Okay.
- Call.
- Call.
The winning hand is folding.
- The pot is ripe.
- Hi, sirs.
Sandwiches from the mess tent.
I hope everybody likes carrier pigeon.
There's ham, chicken and something brown that just lays there.
Here we go.
Jack, four.
Pair of threes.
Queen.
Ace, four.
Everybody know Klinger?
This is Captain Pak, Major Freedman.
Ah, the psychiatrist.
Still trying to get out wearing dresses, Klinger.
Earrings with a sweater?
Klinger, be creative.
I remember a guy, insisted he was a cockroach who would only crawl along the woodwork.
That was Private Kafka, I believe.
Then I had a young man who claimed to be reincarnated.
Said he was with Washington at Valley Forge, and therefore he'd already done his military service.
Just a moment, Nurse.
Hold it, people.
Lieutenant Rogers?
Yes, sir?
This man can't be put under.
He's army counterintelligence.
Can't be anesthetized unless there's another C.I.D. Man present.
In case he tells anything under sedation.
Regulations.
I've notified your H.Q. There will be someone here in a hour.
And I guarantee you you're absolutely in no danger, I think.
Thanks, Doc.
Five clams.
- I'm out.
- I'm in.
I wonder what the chances are of my getting the fifth jack?
Oh, well, not to worry.
Your five and up five.
That's mean.
I'm gonna beat the pants off you, lady.
- Hey, where'd we get the kosher salami?
- I brought it.
Little girl I knew at Berkeley sent it.
She's a yenta now.
Okay, okay, here we go.
Down and dirty.
-  - What's your problem, poker face?
I'm committing suicide.
Go out in turn, Sidney.
Oops, just found something, but I'll check.
Hey, I bought the fifth jack.
I'm out.
Dealer bets ten bucks.
Colonel?
- Uh, Colonel?
- Let's see here.
Fondling your chips is very infantile.
- Not now, Sidney.
- Colonel?
- Not now, Radar.
- But, sir Radar, whatever it is, sign it, cancel it or order five more.
All right, Klinger, I'll see your bet.
- What do you got?
- Full house.
Aces full of tens.
Oh, rats!
Just missed.
- A pair of deuces?
- I don't have to show.
Sir, it's important.
And private.
Okay, deal me out.
- What do you wanna play next, Sam?
- Five-card stud.
High-low.
You can buy one at the end and low hole card wild.
Now, that's inscrutable.
Wait a minute!
Almost killed who?
I don't know what his name is, sir.
You know how dark it is.
I was driving along, and then all of a sudden I felt this thump.
- I think it was a thump.
- Was it a thud or a thump?
No, it was more like a thump.
It was real sharp-like.
Yes, it was definitely a thump, sir a Korean thump.
Why a Korean thump?
'Cause I ran over a Korean.
Holy mackerel, Radar!
Hitting a Korean national!
- They'll put in the cooler till you're a little old corporal.
- Yes, sir.
Just take it easy, son.
Where is he?
- He's in the hospital.
- Let's go.
Yes, sir.
I'm really sorry to take you away from your card game.
Ah, Radar, don't you think you mean more to me than a pair of deuces?
Thank you, one and all.
A popular win.
Well, I think it's about time we separate the men from the boys around here.
- You the new sheriff?
- That's right, sonny.
And this here's the new schoolmarm.
Deal, Tex, already.
No contusions, no abrasions, no bleeding.
- That's good, isn't it, sir?
- No bleeding is best, Radar.
Yes, sir.
- How you feel, old timer?
-  Okay, Nurse, let's get some X rays, find out if anything's broken.
- Yes, sir.
- His old bones snap like kindling.
Uh, gee, I sure am sorry, mister.
I think he understands.
Radar, let me know.
I'll be at the game.
- Whose deal is it?
- I dealt last.
Oh, okay, it's me.
Cut.
Five-card draw, dollar and two, jacks or better, progressive.
Oh, I see the "conference" is in full swing.
Hi, Frank.
What's new up on the mount?
Read any good commandments lately?
It's against regulations to gamble with an enlisted man.
You never enlisted, did you, Klinger?
When they came for me, I ran like a thief right into Grand Central Station.
They trapped me in a pay toilet.
-  Beautiful.
- Cost 'em four dollars in nickels to get me out.
I love a volunteer.
You know, during the physical, they jabbed me with a coat hanger to get me to cough.
Boy, if this doesn't take the cake.
Officers laughing at a draft-dodger while a real soldier lies bleeding in O.R. - What do you mean, bleeding?
- Who's bleeding in O.R.?
A C.I.D. Man.
His chopper crashed.
Looks like multiple internal injuries.
- So why aren't you operating on him?
- You can't anesthetize a C.I.D. Man unless there's another one present.
- That's crazy.
- There's an officer on his way from H.Q. Be here anytime.
Anytime, Frank?
How many minutes are there in an anytime, Frank?
I gave him two units.
I assure you his condition is stable now.
- Being a horse doctor you'd know that.
- I lost a kid that way once.
- Come on, Trap.
- Now, be advised.
If you so much as touch that patient, you're violating army regulations.
Frank, we promise to keep saluting all during the operation.
Deal us out.
Okay, deal me in.
- Lap sponge.
-  Lap sponge.
Keep that suction going.
This guy's drowning in himself.
- He could have easily cashed in.
- Is that Frank a pip?
My vote is we put him in front of a 21 -gun salute.
I'll tell you this.
Frank has definitely put me off reenlisting.
Give me another clamp.
Come on.
Quick.
Hope this guy doesn't mind ignoring orders by living.
- Clamp.
- Sponge.
- Okay, that's enough.
- No, it's not.
Nothing broken here, Radar.
Everything's right where it ought to be.
- Are you sure, sir?
- Radar, I don't know all the medicine in the world, but I can read an X ray with one eye tied behind my back.
Even the hairline.
A little loss of calcium, but that's understandable.
He was born two years before Moses.
Yes, sir.
But look it.
He's all stiff.
It looks like he's paralyzed.
There's your syndrome trauma-induced hysterical paralysis.
- Wow.
That can't be good.
- It's classic, Radar.
His mind's raising hell with his body for getting him in an accident.
It just says, "You just lay there for a while and be rigid, and that'll teach you".
See?
It's all said in Korean, of course.
Well, let's throw the old blanket back and see what I can find.
No, thank you.
What's wrong, Frank?
- I can handle this, Colonel.
- Well, handle it quietly, will you?
I got an old geezer here stiff as an ironing board.
That's the last tray you're going to upset, soldier.
There's a war on!
And we've no time for violence.
I don't wanna go back up there.
I don't wanna go.
Nobody wants to go, fella.
We all know it's brutal at the front, especially those of us at the rear.
There's nothing wrong with you, see?
It's all in your head.
But don't get the idea it's psychological.
I'm not buying that old combat fatigue dodge.
You're going back into the front line, soldier.
The army doesn't care about your head.
Just get the enemy in the crosshairs and blast away.
What's up, Frank?
Fort Sumter been fired upon?
Did you get to the "whites of their eyes" part?
You did it, didn't you?
Operated on the C.I.D. Man.
Yeah, we thought we'd save his life for kicks.
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes when this thing hits the fan.
Oh, you're a big fan hitter, aren't you, Frank?
I don't wanna go back.
I don't wanna go back!
Shut up or I'll have you shipped out tonight.
- Hey, Frank.
- Hmm?
Doctors, medicine, compassion remember?
- We're here to serve.
- Ours is a dedicated, humane profession.
Will Doctors Pierce and Mclntyre kindly return to the conference.
They need your money.
- Dr. Mclntyre.
- After you, Dr. Pierce.
There's a possible straight.
A pair of threes.
Another queen.
I don't know.
And garbage for the dealer.
Pair of queens bets.
- Trapper?
- Wait a minute.
What's everybody got?
- You like to look at my hole card, gringo?
- Very funny.
Don't rush me.
Would you like to make a bet before the war goes into overtime?
- Okay.
I'll check to the possible straight.
- Check along.
- I'm out.
- I'm light five.
- "El foldo".
- All right, I'll see you.
- Over and out.
- Sam, did you get the straight?
Did I hit the straight?
Two, three, four, five, nine.
My queens held up.
Sell me another stack, Shirley.
- Hold it.
Everybody freeze.
- What's the matter?
One of the sandwiches just moved.
I can tell you this much, Major.
This is definitely a court-martial offense.
- I warned them.
I warned them.
- Why didn't you order them?
A warning is like an order.
If you warn hard enough, that's sort of"orderish".
- Were you in the operating room with them?
- No.
I don't like to be around when rules are broken.
A rough situation, Major.
This man's head's full of intelligence.
That's not my department, sir.
Intelligence is something I try to avoid.
I can see that, yes.
How long will he be out?
Oh, he'll be a little groggy for three, maybe four hours.
I want a reliable M.P. Sitting right there with a pad and a pencil all the time.
- Just in case.
- Okay.
You people really know a lot of secrets, don't you?
Yes, we do, but you didn't hear that from me.
Stuff about the war and the Commies and what they do to women that won't talk?
Yep.
- Now, where are these surgeons?
- Right this way, sir.
Lights out, soldier!
Stuff it, Major!
- What the hell is that?
- Oh, he's pretending to be violent.
Great imitation.
I'll settle your hash later, mister!
Okay, moving right along now.
Dealer's choice.
Five-card stud.
Sidney, what's the psychiatric basis for gambling?
- Sex.
- Why?
I don't know.
They tell me to say it.
Sex is why we gamble.
Sex is why we drink.
Sex is why we give birth.
- Thank you, Doctor.
- I'm taking a five-dollar chip.
That was a house call.
Are you guys gonna play cards or chew the fat?
If I wanna chew the fat, I'll eat a sandwich.
- Henry, bet the bullet.
- Okay, I'll bet a buck.
- Here they are.
- Pierce.
Mclntyre.
- Where?
- You two are under arrest.
Whoa.
Hold the phone.
I'm Colonel Blake here.
Nobody arrests them without telling me the whys and wherefores or the reason thereofs.
They operated on a C.I.D. Man without another C.I.D. Man standing by.
Captain Halloran.
Okay.
Did you guys really do that?
- Henry, the guy could have died.
-  He was bleeding, Henry.
And Frank here who studied medicine under General Rommel was too chicken to operate.
He was afraid under anesthesia the lieutenant might give away Harry Truman's hat size.
- Were you present when Lt.
Rogers was given anesthesia?
- Of course.
Just a minute.
Colonel.
- Can these men be trusted?
- Well, certainly.
What about her?
She's my wife.
- That's a very interesting joke, Sam.
- Thanks for seeing me, Sidney.
Look, Captain.
The lieutenant went under like a doll.
The only thing he said under anesthesia was, "Honey, you're the greatest".
It was a textbook operation.
No complications.
He'll be up and snooping in a week.
- Is that the full poop?
- And nothing but the poop.
I split a gut getting down here.
Look, if it'll make you feel any better, the blues are five, the reds are a dollar and the whites are 50 cents.
Deal me in.
It's amazing!
Anyone who comes in here is instantly corrupted!
Hurry up, Frank.
The good ship Lollipop is leaving.
Hey, up close you're a guy.
Far away too.
- Uh, sir?
-  Yes?
- Colonel, sir?
- Radar, I'm trying to lose some money.
Sir, this is about the man that I, uh Radar had a jeep accident.
He hit a local.
- What happened, kid?
- The guy's all right.
He's sitting up.
- I told you, Radar.
- Says if I give him 50 bucks, he won't report me to the M.P.s. Hey, Corporal, is this a little guy about five-foot nothing, anywhere between 50 and 200 years old?
- Yes, sir.
- He looks like he fell off a charm bracelet?
- Yes, sir.
- His name is Hwang?
- Yes, that's what he said, sir.
- You know who you got here the famous Whiplash Hwang.
- What?
- He's the fall-down king of Korea.
Professional accident victim.
He pretends to let a jeep bang into him.
- Then he gets whatever he can for it.
- That's pathetic.
Yeah, it is in a way.
He was a farmer before the war, and then he had to hit the road, literally.
All right, come on.
Ten bucks a man ought to do it.
Hey, this is blackmail.
Maybe I ought to run him in.
Maybe you will on the way home.
Okay, the pot's right.
- Here you go, Radar.
- Thank you, sir.
All you sirs.
- Come on, Hawk.
Deal.
- These sandwiches for anybody?
Anybody with a death wish.
Where were we?
- Whose bet is it?
- Ace, four bets.
- Okay, one buck.
- It's 2:30.
Should we set a time limit?
Okay, one week from today, we deal once around to me.
- That's gunfire.
- It's 2:30 in the morning.
- Maybe there's an after-hours war around here.
-  - Radar, what's going on?
- It's a patient, sir.
He blew his cork.
- Sidney, front and center.
- I'm not going out there without a bulletproof couch.
Okay, the first thing people do in a situation like this is panic.
I think I'm doing it in the right order.
Let me go out there.
One shot and I'll stop him.
Hold it.
Anything you put in him, we have to take out.
One bullet.
That's all.
Okay, one bullet.
Just don't use the gun.
Make way, soldier!
That's Major Burns.
He's in the shower!
Pierce.
Mclntyre.
Sidney.
Come on.
I'm not going back up to the line.
The noise is terrible.
Yes, I understand.
The noise can be very loud.
- Shells have a tendency to explode.
- You've been there.
You know.
Actually, no one's ever asked me.
But I see almost every war picture that comes out.
I feel it's my duty.
You got no clothes on.
Well, I like to take them off when I have a shower.
- Put that gun down.
- Why do you wanna send me back?
Yo?
Frank?
You alone in there?
Well, not exactly.
Uh, Private Carter's in here with me.
I'm fully naked.
He has a gun.
- You all right, Frank?
- Sure.
Fine.
Well, you know.
- You're a liar.
- Yes, I am.
I'd be lying if I said I weren't.
Would you like my sponge?
Private Carter, this is Dr. Freedman.
I'm sick of doctors!
This one keeps saying he wants me to go back to the front!
He's a good man, one of the best in the profession, a terrific doctor and a great human being.
Maybe we should call Father Mulcahy.
He could give the truth the last rites.
The hell he's a great human being.
Yes, the hell I am!
- Carter, what's the problem?
- He's the problem!
He keeps waving the flag in my face!
Ten thousand doctors and we had to get Betsy Ross.
Carter, if there's a legitimate reason for you not to go back to the line, I promise you won't go.
- I've heard that before!
-   Ambulance!
- He's all right, Sidney.
- Yeah, I'm all right.
Yeah.
Just take it very slow.
Take it easy.
- Frank, are you all right?
- It's all over now.
Well, I must admit I was scared silly until I, uh, got the gun away from him.
You know   I never saw him, honest.
Let's go, Whiplash.
You've had a busy day.
I never saw him, honest.
Hey, guys, let's pack it in.
What do you say?
Okay.
Same time next week?
I thought this was the same time next week.
Let's quit.
- I've had enough.
- Yeah, I've had it too.
- Who deals?
- Me, I guess.
Cut 'em, Sam.
Okay, five-card draw.
High, low.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Letter for you, Voskowitz.
Letter from your wife, sir.
Letter for you, sir.
Hey, what'd Santa bring you, Hawk?
Some medical journals from dear old dad.
I hope they're recent.
From the last batch, Pavlov was just buying his first dog.
-  Yippie!
- Good news from home, Frank?
Your neighborhood still restricted?
My neighborhood is not restricted.
There's a Catholic right across the street.
No, I'm afraid that's it, Major.
Just the one letter.
Well then, okay.
Uh, you know what I do to get mail?
I send away for things, like, uh, samples and stuff.
This morning I got a free package of oregano and a house painters' color chart.
And it isn't even a heavy day.
- Thank you, Corporal.
- Uh-huh.
- Mail for you, Colonel Blake.
-  Momentito.
Uh, Radar, tell the cook not to handle the food for the next few days.
The flu again?
Yeah.
Every time he goes to town, he gets the flu.
- Mail, Radar?
- Yes, sir.
Three letters from your wife - Oh.
- And a postcard from your parents.
They're second honeymooning at Niagara Falls.
I do hope they don't give me a little brother or sister.
Yes, sir.
Oh, and that thing you sent away for.
- Oh?
- The Tobasco Film Company of Havana, Cuba.
Oh, good.
Just what the doctor ordered.
Anglo Chemicals is at 471/2, thanks to napalm.
I bought it at 39, and my United Foundry's up too.
They're coming out with a new automatic rifle.
Betting on destruction to win, place and show?
I've got a family to think of.
I've got to leave them something in case I get killed.
Frank, the only way you're gonna get killed is if you operate on yourself.
Attention, all personnel.
Allied incoming casualties.
Report to surgery.
Now there's a good stock for you, Frank Allied Incoming Casualties.
Oh, go soak your head!
That'll teach you to ad-lib with the master.
- Lap sponge.
- Lap sponge.
- Pickups.
- Pickups.
- Speaking of which, what are you doing after the operation?
- Clamp.
- Or during the operation?
-  This is not a cocktail lounge.
You could have fooled me.
You gonna tie that vessel, Frank?
Roger.
Will do.
You might at least try to get an accurate lap sponge count.
Get up on the wrong side of the war this morning, Major?
- I counted ten, ma'am.
- There's only nine here.
- There's none in the patient.
- Frank's not finished yet.
It's on the floor.
Next time try to hit the bucket.
We might have had to go back in on that patient.
-  Give me the suture scissors.
- Suture scissors.
You know better than that!
Wipe those off first!
- I'm sorry, Major.
- Okay, close him up.
- Where's that 4-0 silk suture I asked for?
- They're on the way, Major.
When you come on duty, you check the supplies.
There's no excuse for running out of anything!
I have an announcement!
One more stupidity and every nurse goes on report.
And I'd like to make an announcement.
Maj.
Houlihan and I are getting married.
- What?
- That's outrageous!
- We are not.
- Then go ahead and have the baby alone.
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- Give us a chance.
We just met.
- Oh!
- Oh.
- What's eating you, Margaret?
- At the moment, you are.
I can't help it.
Your ears are so delicious.
What's wrong, honey bunch?
Trisha Spalding, that's what's wrong, honey bunch.
Would you like to tell me about your Trisha Spalding?
We were in training together.
She married a doctor I turned down.
And now she has a beautiful home with a swimming pool, two adorable children, a two-car garage.
Oh, Frank, it all could have been mine!
- That could have been me!
-  That house must have run 40,000.
Forty-five.
I'd have loved him if I'd have known.
But no.
I married the army, and what have I got to show for it?
Rotten living conditions, no social life, surrounded by insolent doctors and nurses who don't give me an ounce of respect.
Darling.
It's only the people who know you that don't give you any respect.
And that's because you hide all your goodness.
I have nothing nothing!
Well, am I nothing, Margaret?
You're government issue, Frank.
You came with my mess kit and my khaki girdle.
- So much for Frank Burns.
- And after you're home, I'll only be a smile on your face your wife won't understand.
Margaret, you're serving your country in the most noble way a woman can.
In the finest tradition of nursing.
You have your commission.
The war can't last forever, Frank.
They'll declare peace, and then where will I be?
Well, there'll always be another war.
Margaret, let's go to Tokyo for the weekend.
I don't want a weekend.
I want a lifetime.
A weekend can be a lifetime if you use it right.
I'm not going anywhere with you, Frank.
This is the end of the line for us.
From now on, I'm number one, me, Margaret Houlihan.
And believe me, soldier, I deserve better than you!
- Col.
Blake in?
- Yeah, but he's busy right now.
Come to attention.
Get to your feet.
Put that cigar out.
Get rid of that magazine.
- Yes, sir.
- It's ma'am.
Men are sirs.
Women are ma'ams.
- I'm a woman.
I'm a ma'am.
- Yes, sir ma'am.
Uh, ma'am, sir.
- Where is Col.
Bubblehead?
- He gave orders not to be disturbed.
- He already is disturbed.
- Excuse me.
- Out of my way, Corporal.
- Major, he's watching a, uh, training film.
And it's pretty rough in there bodies and everything.
Since when do bodies bother me?
Pretty good, huh?
Not much story, but plenty of action.
- It can't be.
- What?
It is.
It's Charlie Abrams' receptionist.
She looks a lot better in balloons than a uniform.
-  Colonel!
- Whoops.
That's the most vulgar, based thing I've ever seen!
Well, Margaret, you can't come in in the middle.
It's disgusting!
The critics panned it, too, but we're trying to judge it on its own merits.
Colonel, I'd like to hear your explanation for this.
- Ah, Major, we're grown men a long way from home.
- Oh!
- For pete's sake.
- Hey!
And truth to tell, the only woman I have to explain anything to is a 35-year-old, slightly pigeon-toed mouth-breather with $2,000 worth of bridge work.
That I still owe $1,500 on.
I'm certain she would find that obscene.
Margaret, there's an even bigger obscenity around here.
It's called the war.
Anyone over 18 is admitted.
Colonel, I want a transfer.
No transfers are issued until the camp comes to a full stop.
And watch your step getting off.
And these two are at the top of my list.
Hey, we finished first and second.
They've totally destroyed my authority with the nursing staff.
They have made a mockery of my majority.
What do you know?
We're major mockers.
Simmer down, Pierce.
That's an order.
An order?
Why don't you stop masquerading as a commanding officer?
You're nothing but a spineless, mealymouthed, fly-fishing impostor!
- He's not an impostor.
- Right.
He's a genuine spineless, mealymouthed, fly-fisherman.
Pierce, you're the limit.
That's right.
Go ahead, laugh.
Oh, come on, Major.
You know what they say.
"A laugh turneth away wrath".
Who says that?
I never heard anybody say that.
Colonel, I am requesting that you officially and formally approve my transfer.
Look, I am glad this has come up.
Now, I want you two guys to straighten up and fly right.
I want you to accord Maj.
Houlihan the courtesy and respect "accordable" to someone who's achieved her high rank and sex.
I am not looking for a truce with these two shower-tent peekers.
You peek into one shower and you're labeled for life.
- You really wanna leave us?
- I really have to.
- Well.
Radar - Here's the transfer papers, sir.
Here you go.
In case you have any second thoughts, we'll keep mum about this.
- Right, group?
- Right.
Whatever was, of course, has been.
But we are a family, Margaret.
Attention, all personnel.
Effective immediately, Maj.
Margaret Houlihan is leaving the 4077th.
There will be wine with dinner with ice cream and chocolate sauce.
Well, there are families and there are families.
- Frank, Margaret's departure is imminent.
- So?
Well, isn't that un-zinging the strings of your heart just a little bit?
None of your business, Captain Buttinsky.
Frank, one is a lonely number.
- I'll thank you to mind your p's and q's.
- That hurt.
Wanna join us?
We're going over with a farewell bottle of"champagne".
- No, thanks.
There are more important things to do.
- Won't you miss her, Frank?
Those midnight meetings behind the delousing tent?
Soaping each other in the scrub room?
Fumbling with the leather aprons in X ray?
-  - Who is it?
-  Lord and Ozzie Nelson.
- Go away!
- What do you two want?
- This is the let bygones be bygones scene, Margaret.
We brought you a little "champers".
- Fifteen minutes ago was a very good year.
- It's especially for you.
Trapper stomped on the grapes himself with his own two reasonably-clean feet.
He really knows how to sell wine.
Miz Margaret.
Miz Hawkeye.
Now that you're going, Margaret, all that stands out are the good things.
If I could remember one I'd mention it.
Fighting, they say, is a form of loving.
I guess we've shown as about as much love for you as we could without knocking your teeth out.
We'll miss you in our hearts.
And in the shower.
- I'd like to propose a toast.
- Hear, hear.
Here's to Captains Pierce and Mclntyre.
To their all-night binges, to their secret nurse ceremonies, to their planting of microphones in sleeping bags, to their childish switching of names on latrines.
All of which goes into my special report to General Mitchell, which culminates in a detailed account of your Thanksgiving "Come as Your Favorite Nude Pilgrim" party.
This stuff isn't champagne.
Champagne tickles my nose.
This stuff eats it away.
-  - Come.
Oh, uh, Margaret.
Let me get my robe.
I'm in my underwear.
How nice for both of you.
You writing a letter to your wife, Frank?
Is there anything in there about you-know-who who used to be your you-know-what?
- Margaret, I don't like to see you bitter.
- Tough toenails.
Here are your things, Frank.
Your picture of us at Osaka, your love letters, your mother's date card and Bimbo.
Margaret, Bimbo is ours.
Bimbo is only a dog stuffed.
Take the hint, Frank.
Margaret, this is so unlike you.
No, it's not.
If I'd have been more like me, you maybe would have liked me more.
- You've been drinking!
- Correction.
I am drinking.
Margaret, that's liquor!
Right, Reverend Davidson.
I'm celebrating a brand-new life.
Six months away from this snake pit and I'll be a colonel.
- I know a lot of generals, you know, Frank?
- I know you know them, Margaret.
And a few lieutenant colonels and one pretty nifty warrant officer who used to be a masseur.
- Do you want a slug, Frank?
- This does not become you, Margaret.
Oh.
What becomes me, Frank?
Hanging around delousing tents, meeting in laundry trucks?
Frank, I believe you have my leather-bound copy of the army officers' guide, my cuticle scissors, tweezers and my Doris Day scrapbook.
I would like them back, please.
This is a terrible way for two friends to part, Margaret.
"Two friends," Frank?
What are you doing, rehearsing a letter to your wife home?
"Darling, did I mention my friend Maj.
Houlihan "has been transferred?
You would have liked him.
Swell guy".
They're out of champagne.
- I think you've had enough, Margaret.
- Who asked you?
Ferret face.
Read that back, Radar.
Yes, sir.
"Tobasco Film Company, Box 245, Havana, Cuba.
"Dear sirs, Thank you for your recent shipment.
"I would like to order some additional film from your catalog - "number 467, Paulina Paris and her Pelican.
- Her Pelican.
- "Also, number 26 216, - 216.
Right.
Francine Laflame and her Tassles in the Air.
" - Uh, sir?
- Hmm?
Do you think they could get anything of Flash Gordon?
Maybe next time, Radar.
Keep going, will you?
Yes, sir.
"Enclosed please find a check for 29.95 "to cover the cost of film, postage and handling.
"Please send as soon as possible.
Sincerely yours" Oh, uh, uh, uh, just sign your name again, Radar.
You know.
I mean, it might not look too good if I, uh Well, you know.
Just sign your name.
- I'll get this out right away.
- Get that out right away, please.
Colonel, I just wanted you to know that I was preparing my final report before I go,  Which I haven't done yet.
- Uh, how do you get into this thing?
- Is there something you want?
I thought a little farewell drink major, colonel.
Looks like you've already been dipping your bill.
You sure you won't reconsider, Major?
No, I've thought it over and I definitely would like another drink.
Okay.
Scotch and water okay?
That's fine.
You can skip the water.
- Okay.
- Okay.
You know, Major, you're making a mistake.
This outfit may be a bit of a booby hatch, but we do awful good work together.
Yeah, I can't fight you there.
Cheers.
I need army discipline.
I need a sense of order.
Can't you understand that, Colonel?
Why don't you call me Henry, for pete's sake?
That's really swell of you, Pete.
Do you know that you look just like my father before he died?
Well, a lot of people have said that.
It's funny how you only get to know people after they're gone.
I feel real close to you right now.
Yeah, sure.
Uh, that scotch you just poured is rye.
That's okay.
The champagne I just had was gin.
Sir, we just got word, a company of marines has been hit pretty bad.
- The choppers evacuating?
- Yes, sir.
Should be here in about 45 minutes.
- Okay, alert all personnel on O.R. - Both shifts?
Yeah, both shifts.
Get every patient out of the hospital that can walk.
- That's basically everything.
- Oh, my goodness.
It's an emergency.
It's a good thing I'm a nurse.
- What's cooking, Henry?
- A lot of hurt people coming in marines.
- Could be a long stretch.
- Marines?
That means youngsters.
Boy, I'd give $50 to see a varicose vein.
- Give me the money and I'll drop my pants.
- Everything's ready, sir.
- Did you make sure all the hospital beds are available?
- Every available bed's available.
- Okay, call and make sure the helipad is clear.
- Yes, sir.
Okay.
Oh.
Corporal.
I wonder if I can see Col.
Blake?
I wonder if you can too.
Maj.
Margan Houlihet reporting for duty, sir.
Boy, drunk as a skunk.
- She's tanked.
- A fine time to make a drinking debut.
Where are the casualties, sir?
Now just hold your horses.
They're not even here yet.
Well, then let's go get 'em, sir.
I'll drive.
Major?
Major, dear, you're drunk.
Oh, I'm not so think as you drunk I am.
- You'd better go to your tent, Major.
- I can't operate in my tent.
You're doing okay so far.
- Go salute yourself!
-  That's it.
Come on.
We better get her out of here.
Sober her up.
- We're gonna need her tonight.
- Why us?
Because there are a lot of people here who might enjoy seeing this get on her record.
- And we wouldn't?
- I think you guys are in a different league.
Besides, I'm ordering you to do it.
- Please?
- You said the magic word.
- Where are we going?
- Never you mind.
- What are you doing?
- New surgical procedure.
You have to scrub up from head to toe in your clothes.
That's ridiculous.
I like it.
More.
You wanna know something?
You really wanna know something?
- No.
- Okay.
- What?
- I really could have gone for you.
Well, it's been known to happen.
Not you.
Him.
That curly blond hair and that crooked smile.
And you're really built, too, you know, you son of a gun.
And there you were out of uniform, unshaven, no sirs, no salute, no nothing.
That's when I fell in love with him.
So, where did that leave me?
I turned to that no-lip, chalk-skinned, sniveling wife lover.
- Frank Burns.
- Yes.
Did either of you ever kiss Frank?
- Not me.
How about you?
- I was hoping maybe this New Year's Eve.
I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but Frank Burns is a lipless wonder.
Come on now.
Down the hatch.
Ow!
What was that?
A load of B-1 to get you on your feet again.
And I didn't get you anything.
- Richardson.
- Lap sponge.
- Number ten blade.
- Gonna do a little cutting, Frank?
Well, as long as I'm there, I thought I'd go after the appendix.
That's not the appendix, Frank.
That's my pinky.
And I'm very fond of it.
Oh.
- Forceps.
- Forceps.
Doctor?
Doctors?
Hmm?
I'm grateful to you for helping me.
- Don't mention it.
- To anyone.
We have reputations to protect.
Suction.
- Suction.
- You know something, Trap?
- Huh?
- You really are built, you son of a gun.
Here's some more coffee, Margaret.
Thanks, Frank.
Feeling any better?
Please.
I'd have to be dead three days to feel better.
Poor darling angel.
Shut up, Frank.
Whatever you say.
I'm just so glad you're not going anywhere.
That's so true, Frank.
Hi, kids.
Mind if we join you?
Margaret?
Margaret?
I wanna tell you how much last night meant to me.
I just wanna know that you're not playing games.
He means it.
I saw him carving your name on a patient.
Huh?
All those years I wasted taking showers by myself.
- Now hold on!
- Watch it, Trap.
He's got a scalpel in his sock.
- I do not!
- How do you talk so well with no lip?
Will you listen to that?
Terrific, isn't it, sir?
Yep, it's nice having the children all together again.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Okay, watch the birdie.
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.
- Ginger.
-  All right, relax.
- See anything, Doc?
- We send these out to the drugstore to be developed.
- You stay with us.
We do beautiful work.
Feel okay?
- Okay, Doc.
Private Mitchell's pictures, sir.
Oh, wow.
- That guy looks like he swallowed a junkyard.
- Yeah.
Ginger, prep that man for surgery.
It's a chest case, and I'm too beat to do it alone.
Wake up Hawkeye.
While he's asleep?
That's the best time.
Hawkeye?
Hawk?
Hawkeye?
Sir?
Radar, who asked you to wake my feet?
Sir, your head's at the wrong end.
No, it's not.
It's always been here.
I'm gonna count to three and by the time I get to one, I want you out of here.
Mclntyre needs you in surgery.
I just came off If I cut open one more body, it'll be yours for waking me.
Out!
Cover my feet.
The light's shining in my toenails.
It's a chest case and they're prepping the patient.
If I'd have been a plastic surgeon, I could be doing noses now at $1000 a nostril.
Yes, sir.
As an eye man all you do is turn out the lights, say, "Read the top three lines".
- And you go to sleep while they're reading it.
- Yes, sir.
Even as a proctologist I'd have been seeing new faces all the time.
- Clamp.
- Clamp.
- I've got a little bleeding here.
Suction.
- Suction.
This kid had a lot of artillery for lunch.
- Mm.
Ready for the retractor?
- Wait a minute.
Okay.
- Rough one, huh?
- Very unpretty.
- How's it going, guys?
- Fine.
Pull up a chair.
We'll deal you in.
- You know what you got there?
- Ayoung shrapnel collector.
That's General Mitchell's son, Fifth Airborne.
A general's son?
- Hey, Hawk, we're finally playing the Palace.
- Now I'd wished we washed.
How's he doing?
He's got tracheal lacerations, but the esophagus is okay.
- Right.
-  Colonel?
Major Burns is ready to assist.
What do you think I'm doing, stalling till my room is ready?
I think it fitting a captain be assisted by a major when working on the son of a general.
I think you just conjugated the Pentagon.
Lap sponge.
Colonel, I outrank Mclntyre.
It is well within my purview to order him away from that table.
Frank, why don't we just take our gloves off and step outside?
I'm not operating too loud for you people, am I?
All right, let's can the chatter.
Pierce, any way we can help?
How about deserting alphabetically?
Suction.
Klinger, you've asked for my advice.
- Now, I realize how badly you want out of the army.
- Yes, sir.
But it's my considered opinion that no one's going to believe that you're pregnant.
Well, I don't expect them to, sir.
I just want them to see I'm so crazy that I think they would think I'm gonna have a baby.
Well, it's none of my business, Klinger, but, uh, should someone in your condition be smoking a cigar?
- Gen.
Mitchell's helicopter's just landing, sir.
- Gen.
Mitchell?
- Yes, sir.
I sent a jeep for him.
- Holy cow!
Uh, Radar, kill the laundry.
Klinger, would you fix the bed?
Congratulations.
- Can I do anything else, sir?
- Uh, no.
- Yes, get rid of those pillows.
I'm terminating your pregnancy.
- Not in front of the general.
- I'll just wear my basic black, maybe pearls.
- Get out.
Ten-hut!
Col.
Blake.
General.
Uh, dismissed, Corporal.
Yes, sir.
- Corporal?
- Uh, well, he's in the big show Saturday night.
I understand my boy couldn't have been in better hands, Colonel.
- Well, we did our best, General.
- He's doing well, is he?
Very well.
Right now he's sleeping like a baby.
Like a general's baby.
Captain.
You do much fishing, do you?
Oh, I do a little fooling around.
I'd like to have seen the one that got away.
You know how it is.
Yeah, I used to.
- Uh, Corporal O'Reilly.
- Yes, sir!
- Would you, um - Yes, sir.
I'll, uh Yes, sir.
I'll get these to a poor family.
Oh, that'll be very nice.
Well, uh, I'd like to go over to the hospital and visit the boy, - if you don't mind.
- Oh, yes, indeed.
Here's a little token of my appreciation.
That's 12-year-old scotch.
- That's very generous, General.
- Goes down real smooth.
Well, at that age, it should know the way.
- Vital signs?
- Blood pressure: 130 over 80.
Pulse: 92.
- Continue the I.V.s. - Yes, Doctor.
Frank, here comes the general.
- How do I look?
- Straighten up.
Yes, Doctor, we're continuing the I.V. S as ordered.
Gen.
Mitchell, Maj.
Houlihan, Maj.
Burns.
Doctor, I wanna thank you for operating on my son.
Uh, well, sir, l Well, the major didn't actually operate in the sense that he operated.
His participation, more or less, took the form of offering to assist the surgeon who was assisting the surgeon who did the operation without the further need of assistance.
Maj.
Burns wanted to be free to supervise.
- Supervision is your key in an important operation.
- Uh-huh.
Somebody has to be there to say, "How's everything going, men"?
It obviously went well.
Your son deserves a great deal of the credit, General.
That's the truth.
He came through it like a trouper.
Or rather a paratrooper in this case.
Yes, we're all proud of him the way he laid there.
I'm indebted to all of you.
I would like to meet the doctor who performed the operation.
That would be our Capt.
Pierce.
Best doctor in the whole darn shootin' match.
Well, men, name it.
- Name what, sir?
- The general wants to reward our effort.
The captain's very fast at catching my drift.
I played left drift in high school.
I'd like to say thank you in some substantial way.
How 'bout surrendering so we can all go home?
At least call the war a draw.
Oh, General, I think your offer is more than enough.
- No, no!
- I agree.
- His offer is less than enough.
- Don't be so modest with our greed, Henry.
How about three days in Tokyo?
Do three nights go along with it?
A suite at the Imperial Hotel.
And a "please disturb" sign on the door.
You got it!
You will wear trousers in Tokyo?
At least until we check in.
What?
Oh, wait.
Hold on.
He just walked in.
- Telephone, sir.
- Hi, there.
How are you today?
- Who am I talking to?
- Mr. Yurkuri.
He runs the Imperial Hotel.
Yes, sir, what can I do for you?
When?
Last night?
In the main dining room?
They sent a case of pipe cleaners to MacArthur's table.
Sir, I can guarantee you the men will be severely reprimanded the minute What?
When?
Yes, sir, I'll grant you, that's a little out of line.
- What, sir?
- Rickshaw races in the lobby.
What is your name, sir?
Yoger Yog Everett, is it?
Everett, let me get back to yosu.
If you'll just tell me, ma'am, how many of the girls are missing, maybe I can help you.
Half the graduating class of your pearl diving school?
Sir?
Uh, sir, are you asleep?
What have they done, Radar?
- The Fujikowa bath house in Tokyo.
- Mm-hmm.
They report Captains Pierce and Mclntyre were bobbing for customers.
Thank you, Radar.
Yes, sir.
Ah, home at last.
It's good to get away, but it's lousy to get back.
Jennings, put the bags in our suite, have the jeep washed and take the rest of the war off.
- What is that?
-  An officers'club.
When you two were wallowing in the fleshpots ofTokyo, I arranged for that with Gen.
Mitchell.
- Terrific!
- And you wanted to write him out of your will.
Hey, this is great.
Slot machines, jukebox.
It's done in early kickback.
Now there's a general who really knows how to pay his doctor's bill.
Orders, sirs.
What do you think of that?
You leave the place three days, it turns into an army camp.
What is that thick brown stuff?
It's either liquid steak or chocolate pudding with gristle.
Ten-hut!
Radar, what the hell is this?
The senior N.C.O. Present requests Captain's permission for men to resume eating, sir.
I believe this is the first case of teenage male menopause.
Come on, you guys.
Break it up.
Yeah, as you were.
You're not serious?
Well, the new officers' only club is for officers only and etcetera, just like this.
Radar, it's us, your aunt and uncle.
Yeah, how can you frost us?
Think of all we've been through together.
- We got you drunk the first time.
- Taught you how to drive a jeep.
Both on the same night.
I remember that well, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Radar, if you don't cut that out, I'll pull your cap down over your shoulder.
- We're gonna talk to Henry.
- We'll get the sign taken down.
- There'll be no discriminating around here.
- Absolutely.
Trust us.
You gonna eat your fat?
We really reached him.
- That was good work, Lieutenant.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.
How about if I pick you up about 8:00, your tent?
- And then?
- About 8:15, my tent.
- What do you say?
- Doctor, you're naughty.
With any luck at all.
You know, I was thinking - Hey, Henry, hold baby time.
- Ha, ha.
Back from Tokyo, are we?
- Apparently.
- Did you have a good time?
- Great.
- Well, you did everything but swim in the emperor's moat.
- Henry, what about the officers' club?
- That's a beauty, isn't it?
It's prefab.
You know something.
Just two-and-a-half hours after that big chopper set down that first wall, I was wearing a lamp shade and being sick over anybody that would listen.
- But Henry, the place is restricted.
- That's not true.
Any officer, regardless of race, color or creed can go in and get bombed out of his skull.
Come on, Henry.
It's not fair.
Hey, hey.
All the enlisted guys are very disgruntled.
Look, I can't be responsible for anybody's "gruntlement".
Gen.
Mitchell, out of the kindness of his gratitude, gave us this marvelous club, which by the by can double as a church on Sunday.
Oh, great.
St. Patrick's Church and Grill.
Pierce, I'm serious.
We throw a poncho over the jukebox and we can use it for a pulpit.
Terrific.
We get three sermons for a quarter.
Henry, listen.
That place is so un-us.
Well, I wanna tell you something.
The club is up, the sign is up and so is the time you're spending on my back.
- So get off!
- Touch a nerve?
Henry, look.
If we can get enough officers to agree with us, - will you throw the club open for everybody?
- Yeah, sure.
If you can swing it, fine.
Okay?
Henry, you're one of the three great people in this conversation.
Thank you.
Hey, on the level, guys, did you really send pipe cleaners to Gen.
MacArthur?
No, it was a lady correspondent.
Her corncob fooled us.
Hey.
I was Here you are, Major.
One Shirley Temple.
I've been looking forward to this all day.
That's very good, um Kwang Duk, sir.
- That's a cute name.
- We're a cute people.
Hi, soldier.
All alone?
What'll you have, my dear?
A scotch old-fashioned, without the fruit, please.
One scotch old-fashioned, hold the garbage.
We'll be at our table.
- Major.
- Thank you, Major.
Pretzels, peanuts?
Frank, you're a different person when we go out.
Thank you, Kwang.
Put that on my tab.
And add five percent for yourself.
Thank you, sir.
To the best night nurse I've ever known.
-  You devil.
-  Hi, gang.
Spanky got a flat, or we would have been here sooner.
Oh, do join us.
- Innkeeper?
- Yes, sir?
Two very dry martinis.
And Margaret, what is that, an old-fashioned?
- Without fruit, yes.
- Frank?
- He knows what I'm drinking.
- Another Shirley Temple.
With a Jane Withers chaser.
Easy, Frank.
You're operating later.
Listen, you two bozos.
The major and I were having a quiet drink together, and I'd appreciate it if you'd amscray.
Margaret, let me dance my way into your heart.
- Now just a minute!
- Be patient, Frank.
I'll get to you next.
Where does he get off Frank, I want you to sign this petition to let enlisted men into the club.
Are you goofy?
Must we dance so close?
I do.
It's a muscular problem.
If I don't rub thighs with someone every four hours, I get the bends.
Keep your distance.
- Margaret?
- Yes?
We've got a petition to let the enlisted men in the club.
- Forget it.
- Sign it, Margaret.
I'm warning you.
My legs are loaded.
- What's he doing?
- Nothing to worry about, Frank.
You can still see some light between them.
Come on.
Sign the petition.
Fat chance, bub.
Margaret, if you don't sign I'll give you a dip your coccyx will never forget.
Excuse me.
Big shot.
I'll finish this dance.
Well, I guess the best man won, ya big lug.
- Any luck?
- Frank wouldn't sign his own stay of execution.
- How did you do with her?
- Fantastic, but she wouldn't sign.
- I don't suppose you'd like to finish this dance?
- Not really.
Let's get back to the ship.
- How you doing, tiger?
- Whole lot better, Doc.
As someone who's seen your inside, I can tell you your outside looks great.
- Klinger.
- Yes, sir.
Discontinue the I. V. S and start him on a full liquid diet.
Yes, sir.
Will do, sir.
Attention, all officers.
Gen.
Maynard Mitchell will officially open the officers'club at 2100 hours today.
For the enlisted personnel, there will be a special screening in the mess tent of an animated V.D. Cartoon, Hansel and Regretel.
- Maybe we can work something out.
- Could be.
- Okay, you got your orders.
- Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
Cut that out or I'll snap your garter belt.
##  - Yo.
- May I serve you, sir?
You bet ya.
I've been dying for a banana daiquiri.
Is that a drink, sir?
Oh, yeah.
You just take some bananas and some rum and some cream and some crushed ice and you just put it in a blender.
We've got no bananas, no rum and no blender, sir.
And only powdered cream.
- Okay, give me a beer.
- Yes, sir.
Major, Major, Colonel, Captain.
Captain, Colonel, Major, Major.
Well, I for one am impressed.
Dress uniforms.
And you even shaved.
Well, if you could, it was the least we could do.
Kwang?
Uh, two martinis, please, painfully dry.
- Yes, sir.
-  Ten-hut!
As you were, people.
- Gen.
Mitchell.
- Colonel.
It's both an honor and a privilege and a pleasure to welcome you to that which only through your magnanimous generosity are we able to be standing in the middle of it.
That's the least I could do.
- General, I believe you remember me.
- Oh, yes, of course.
I'm the backup surgeon who supervised the possible assistance, if not the actual operation of your son.
I see, yes.
- Maj.
Houlihan, in charge of nursing.
- I can believe that.
And I'm Capt.
Pierce, the African explorer.
I understand my boy's doing very well, Captain.
- Well, I've been giving him around-the-clock attention, sir.
- But he's getting better anyway.
- I'd like to get over to the hospital and see him.
- General?
Would you like to have a little drink first to sort of baptize the bar?
- We were counting on you to throw out the first drunk.
- Well, uh Yes, of course.
- Let me have a rye.
- A rye and what, sir?
- Rye and don't stop bringing it.
- Yes, sir.
- Sir?
Sir?
- Yes?
- Gary!
- Hi, Dad.
I'd salute, but I might fall on my face.
- You walked up here on your own, huh?
- Well, with a little help.
- Pretty good, huh?
- Come on in.
I'll buy you a drink.
General, I'm sorry, sir.
Perhaps you don't realize it, but your wife gave birth to an enlisted man.
And it is officers only.
Pierce, I'd like to talk to you for a minute about your possible execution.
I wonder if I could say something useful.
I've often wondered that myself, Frank.
Gen.
Mitchell gave us this club, and I think, fair man that he is, he's entitled to hold it over our heads.
- Hear, hear!
-  No, no!
Pierce has a point.
The custom is officers only.
Well, perhaps we should stretch that point, General.
Make an exception for relatives.
What do you say, Blake?
It's your outfit.
My mind is wide open, sir, to whatever you think.
- Come on.
- Now remember.
No booze.
You're still convalescing.
Now that we've established the policy, there are a few relatives of my own I'd like to bring in.
Corporal O'Reilly, who's been like a son to me.
Corporal Klinger, who's been like a daughter.
Here's the rest of my little family.
- ## - Cousin Fred.
- My brother-in-law Leroy.
- ## My cousin Phil.
My second cousin on my mother's side, Ed.
Bill, my mother's cousin's brother.
Sam, my cousin's brother's mother.
##   I don't care if he is a general.
That's too close.
Right.
Why don't you have some more of your Shirley Temple, Frank?
Right.
I'm gonna punch him in the nose.
- Oh, go get him, Frank.
- Right.
First, I think I'll have a little faint.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
##  ## Parade rest.
As you all know, tonight Colonel Blake will resume his command after a week in Tokyo.
Now, unless I made a few remarks about my recent stint as your temporary supreme commander, I would be derelict in my "officiousness".
I think you'll all agree that by trying to introduce more discipline, more order, I have hopefully made this a more enjoyable war for all of us.
Leadership is a lonely business.
Your Napoleons, your Kaisers, your Attilas the Hun were all alone there in the front office as I have been this week.
I have thought of you, and, oh, you have thought of me.
But some of the notes in the suggestion box were really below the belt.
I mean, why drag my mother into this?
-  - Oh.
Well, um, that's about it.
Corporal, deform the men.
Company, ten-hut!
Dismissed.
##  To the return of Henry Blake.
Able to leap tall bar stools at a single bound.
Faster than a speeding nurse.
- It's Super Colonel!
- Ta-da!
- More cocoa, Frank?
- Just a smidge.
Frank, I'm gonna show you something you've never seen before.
Oh?
My diary.
Last night's entry.
"Dear Diary.
I can't go to sleep before I tell you "about my scrumptious Major F.B. "In the last few days, it's been so exciting to watch his growth "as a commander.
"Diary, I really feel this man, dare I say, my man, "has greatness in him.
And I'm grateful that a little bit of it occasionally rubs off on me".
- Oh, Margaret.
-  -  Major Burns, sir?
- He's not here!
We had a call from Col.
Blake.
- What is it?
- Are you there?
I just got here.
He's doing a snap inspection.
Yes, sirs.
Just slip the message under the door.
It's verbal.
I'll get my mouth dirty.
- What is it?
- Col.
Blake's apologies, sir.
He won't be home for two more days, and he said that you should keep carrying on.
I guess that goes for both of you.
That'll be all, Corporal.
Dismissed.
Smoke if you got 'em.
I don't smoke, sir.
- Then go to sleep, on the double!
- Yes, sir.
Two whole days!
- Hit it!
- Hit it!
## Ten-hut!
- The O.R. Was jumping, huh?
- Full house every night.
- I think we're ready to open the war on Broadway.
- Lots of head wounds.
That comes from trying to take hills the other guys have grown fond of.
You pulled every one of'em through.
You guys make me look awful good.
- All right, Henry, what is it?
- What is what it?
Henry, you're bursting with something.
Your face could open a branch smile.
Okay, guys, brace yourselves.
- Sit down.
- We're sitting, Henry.
Then I'll sit.
I can't sit.
I'm already sitting.
- Then I gotta stand.
- Henry!
Okay, guys, okay.
I'm in love.
Okay, guys, okay.
I'm in love.
Okay, okay, I know it's crazy.
I'm 44 years old and I only hear about half of what anybody says.
And I'm starting to brush my hair with a towel.
And my hips are forming a rain gutter for my waist.
And I'm thinking about moving my cot into the latrine so that I can cut down on the traveling time.
And yet, this middle-aged mess from Bloomington, Illinois, is head-over-heels, puppy-dog in love.
Well, don't keep us in suspense.
Who's the man, woman or child?
- Check one.
- Fourth picture's the best.
That's a nice looking kid.
- Real winner.
- And you're in love with her mother?
Get out.
No, that's it.
That's her.
Nancy Sue Parker.
Nancy Sue.
Henry, did you get a chance to ask her her age before the gym teacher called the police?
Just a minute here.
She's no kid.
She'll be 21 in August.
Henry, you've got a corn that's 21.
Okay, okay.
I know, I know.
I'm a damned fool, right?
- No, Henry, we didn't say that.
- Where did you meet her?
I'm in the Dai-Ichi Hotel coffee shop with Mel Rosenbloom.
He's the - The U.N. Gynecologist?
- The U.N. Gynecologist.
And we're trying to decide which bathhouse to go to after breakfast.
Well, the hostess comes over and she says, "Do you mind sharing"?
And wham, bang, Miss Nancy Sue Parker of Independence, Ohio, pulls up a chair and sits right down in my heart.
- Hit me.
- She's a clerk typist, a civilian, with the air force.
Our eyes met and it was as though we'd known each other all our lives.
Except that you're one life up on her.
Half-hour later, there I am, Dr. Henry Blake walking down the Ginza holding hands with that beautiful kid, capillaries wide open wanting to yell, "I'm in love" to everybody in sight.
Secure in the knowledge that very few Japanese correspond with your wife.
Oops.
- You said the magic word.
- It's an ordinary word.
Something found around the house every day.
Hey, what what am I gonna do about Lorraine?
Henry, what is there to do?
You've flung your fling.
You spent a week in the rumble seat of the time machine.
Now it's back to Dr. And Mrs. Henry Blake regret to announce their forthcoming anniversary.
It's not that simple.
I mean, you guys aren't reading me.
I've got the big "L," L-U-V the real thing.
Hawkeye pegged it, Henry.
You think you're the first to do what you did?
Hold it.
It's happened to many a married man, dead or alive.
I grant you, sometimes you can't always tell the difference.
Henry, why don't you just file this under "Andy Hardy Remembers His Teeth in the Glass".
Okay, I think you guys will be clued in better on Friday when Miss Parker comes up for the weekend from Tokyo.
Gloryosky, Henry.
It will all be on the up-and-up, of course.
Well, of course.
I mean, she'll have her own tent and I'll be in mine.
Right.
Now, if you'll excuse us, we'll start digging the tunnel.
##  -  - Hello?
Uh, the door's locked, sir.
Um, hang on, Radar.
This door's never locked.
Just hold your bladder, Radar.
Come in.
What is it, Radar?
- Huh?
- You wanted to see me?
Yes.
Captain Cosgrove confirmed that he'll fly Miss Parker that's the young lady here at 1700 hours Friday night.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Uh, flowers will be placed in the V.I.P. Tent immediately after delousing and disinfecting.
That's lovely.
Anything else?
Uh There'll beJapanese lanterns in the officers' club and the cook is making a special cocktail dip out of powdered eggs, lard and prune juice.
Sounds yummy.
Radar.
- Sir?
- See to it that this gets put on the jukebox, please?
- "You Make Me Feel So Young"?
- Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
- Is that it?
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Good.
- Oh.
These letters from home came while you were away.
Mm-hmm.
Just put 'em on my desk.
Well, if you want I could wait for you to dictate an answer.
- That'll do, Radar.
- Yes, sir.
Mm-hmm.
- How you doing, champ?
- Terrific.
Henry, your hair is bleeding.
Four, - five - Half-hour to Miss Parker, sir.
- Uh-huh.
- You okay?
Of course I am.
Twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine - Hey, Henry, she get here yet?
- Not yet.
The school bus must be late.
Pierce, 86 on those cracks.
- As a personal order?
- Okay, Henry.
Teenager at 2:00.
- Hi!
- Hi, Henry.
Oh!
Easy.
Now watch it.
Don't get your pretty little foot caught.
Kill your engine, will you?
I'm a doctor, you can believe me.
That's a nice leg.
That sweater's not filled with chopped liver either.
Whoopsie.
Watch the mud.
Radar!
Hold on.
Miss Nancy Sue Parker, these are Captains Pierce And these are Captains Mclntyre.
Hi.
So nice to meet you.
Henry's told me what great doctors you are.
Just by seeing you I can tell it's true.
- Radar!
- Yes, sir?
- Would you take Miss Parker's - Bags.
Yes, sir.
And you, you just have to be Corporal O'Reilly.
Yes, I just have to be, ma'am.
Nobody else wants to be.
Is he adorable?
You just wanna take him home and cuddle him.
We do that all the time.
But if you get him wet, his stuffing comes out.
Okay, guys, I think we'll just run along.
Would you like to freshen up, Nancy?
Whatever you say.
You're the boss.
It's nice to have met you.
Will I see you again?
Oh, yes, we live here.
Well, come along, dear.
- What do you think?
- The age difference could be a problem.
Yeah.
She's 21 and his wife is 42.
Well, here you go.
Yep, we've had a lot of V.I.P. S in here.
But no one V.I.P. Er than you.
Okay, Radar.
Mucho "appreciado".
Thanks a lot.
Uh, will that be all, sir?
That'll be more than all, Radar.
Do you wanna answer those letters home, sir?
Not now, Radar.
- Yes, sir.
- Bye, Radar.
Bye, ma'am.
He really is adorable.
The whole place is adorable!
Oh, Henry.
- Gosh, did I ever miss you.
- Me too.
- You're all I thought about.
- Me too.
- What are you wearing?
- Practically nothing.
Rats!
I gotta go on duty.
I got a patient with a weepy abscess.
- Boy, I love you.
- Me too.
## - Good evening, Lieutenant, Captain.
- Hi, Kwang.
- Dry martini, right, Captain?
- There should be dust on the olive.
- Sheila?
- I'd like something weak.
How 'bout me?
I can't say no to anybody.
- I'll just have some ginger ale.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh.
- ##  There she is.
Nancy Sue, I'd like you to meet two of my friends.
This is Bob.
Is that what all the fuss is about?
-  - He's making a jackass out of himself.
- It's immoral.
- Disgusting.
- Frank, is that your knee?
- I thought it was yours.
Well, as long as it's ours.
Watch it.
- All we have to be is polite.
Simply correct.
- Right.
- Anything more looks like we approve.
- How could we?
A married man fooling around with another woman.
- Honey, I want you to meet some people.
- Okay.
Miss Parker, Majors Houlihan and Burns.
Nancy, Margaret, Frank.
I'm Frank.
She's Margaret.
It's a very genuine pleasure to have you at the 4077 th, Nancy dear.
Oh, it's mine too.
Everyone's been so terrific about being nice to me.
It's nice to be nice to the nice.
She's darling, Henry.
Looks a little like your oldest daughter, doesn't she, Frank?
He has three.
They're all back in the States.
Well, "goom-bye," people.
We're gonna wet our whistle.
Glad to have met you.
"It's nice to be nice to the nice"?
Just making conversation.
Try doing it with your mouth shut.
Well, have fun, kids.
Oh, you remember Capt.
Pierce.
And this is Lt.
Sturner.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Can I interest you two in a blast?
Kwang, we'll have - One Pink Lady.
- And I'll have a Peach Blow Fizz.
-  Yes, sir.
- Uh-huh.
- Golly, you really have a fun command.
- Oh, yes.
- ## - Now you have gone and done it.
- Done what, dear?
This is just like my music from Ohio State.
I used to be a cheerleader.
I don't know why that doesn't surprise me.
Does that take me back to those Saturday afternoons.
Kwang, I think we'll have our drinks at the table.
God, makes my legs homesick.
- Give us a cheer, Nance.
- Pierce.
Come on.
One for the Gipper.
Look at Henry.
The proud father.
- ## - Oh!
Wow.
Oh, wow!
That was swell.
Big news, Nancy.
The team broke its leg.
They want you to star in the second half.
I used to be so much better.
I'm so out of shape.
- Is there anything I can do to help?
- Steady, Mclntyre.
- Your drinks, Colonel.
- Thanks, Kwang.
- That was really nice.
-  Attention Doctors Blake and Mclntyre.
Report to surgery on the double.
It's an emergency.
Doctors Blake and Mclntyre.
- Oh, fudge!
- Henry, I'll work with Trapper.
No, no, you've had a little of the wet stuff, Pierce.
I'll take it.
I'll be right back.
Nancy, it's all in a day's work.
- Come on, Mclntyre.
- We'll keep your drinks warm.
Okay.
- What do you think?
- Yuck.
- I meant Nancy.
- What's not to like?
- Yeah.
- Suction.
- Suction.
- Everybody likes Nancy.
I honestly think even my wife would like her.
Henry, get away from the ether.
So this happened three times.
Finally, the guy turned to his wife and said  Thanks a lot.
Good night, Captain.
Good night, Lieutenant.
- Aren't you supposed to salute?
- We don't know each other well enough.
- Good night, Nancy.
Nice meeting you.
- Me too.
She your girl?
No, I'm married to my work.
I'm too cheap to buy a ring.
- Well, here you go.
I'll see you tomorrow, I'm sure.
- I'm sure.
- Breakfast is at 5:00.
- But isn't it still dark then?
It helps if you can't see it.
- Speaking of seeing - The light is right on the Here.
- Thanks.
- No charge.
- You're tall.
- My folks planned it that way.
They saved up their money, so no matter what happened, I'd be tall when I was 21.
- I love tall men.
- Me too.
I've always been crazy about Abe Lincoln.
Hawkeye, the first time we met, you knew it too.
- It was in the air.
- That was Henry.
He was sweating a lot.
Nancy.
In the first place, I wanna thank you from the bottom of my mouth.
Secondly, we're not in the parking lot at the prom.
And lastly, one of us loves Henry Blake, and I think it's me.
It was nice meeting you and your pom-poms.
- Hey, buddy.
- Beat it.
I haven't got a dime for a cup of coffee.
Henry's Nancy just gave me a good night tonsillectomy you wouldn't believe.
- You're kidding.
- And Henry thinks he's found the real thing.
Holy cow.
Radar just got Henry out of postop to talk to his wife on the telephone.
Come on, before he blows his marriage.
- Was she good?
- My lips may never walk again.
Don't send me your stubs.
I can't balance your checkbook in a war zone.
Lorraine?
Lorraine?
Lorraine, please don't talk to me and the kids at the same time.
L What Andrew?
Andrew, I don't care if your sister did put an ice cube down your underwear.
Girls will do that.
You mustn't hit her with the dog.
Now look, Andrew.
Until I get home, you're the man of the house.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know Mommy thinks that she is, but you really are.
So behave yourself and take good care of everybody till I get back.
Just as soon as the war is over, son.
Okay, pal, put her on.
Lorraine, honey Yeah.
Send me the check stubs.
I'll straighten it out.
Of course I do.
Good-bye, darling.
What do you guys want?
- We We just wanted to say good night, Henry.
- Right, yeah.
Listen.
Remember I said I found a girl who was the real thing?
Well, she's $68 overdrawn.
- Good night.
- Good night, Henry.
Good night.
- Radar?
- Sir?
- My wife was very grateful that I called her.
- Yes, sir.
Makes me wish I had.
Well, I figured since you didn't have time to answer her letters Good night, Radar.
See you at breakfast.
Yes, sir.
5:00 sharp.
Let's give ourselves a treat, huh?
Yes, sir.
Now, you will call me, won't you, Henry?
Oh, yeah, sure.
I don't get to Tokyo that often, but you'll be the first.
Good-bye, Henry.
Rah, rah.
That's life, huh?
I couldn't wait till she got here.
Now I'm glad she's gone.
Just as well, Henry.
If you'd sucked your gut in one more time, your belly button would've fallen out your back.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
- What do you got there, Radar?
- Oh, it's probably a mistake.
Five thousand diapers and five thousand pairs of rubber pants.
Well, you're all set for winter.
Uh-huh.
- I'd give $10 for this war to be over.
- Put me down for ten.
Twenty dollars.
How could they turn us down?
We could even go to 25, but don't tell them that in the beginning.
Three months ago Hey.
Three months ago, I ordered new boots.
I made it easy.
I said, "New boots or let me go back to my old shoe store in Vermont".
Reasonable.
I even offered to let them resole my foot.
Three months waiting.
I could've had a third of a baby by now.
You don't have the hips for it.
I need a thick something.
- What's this?
- Frank's birthday.
I wonder how old he is.
Why don't we saw him in half tonight and count his rings?
"To my darling husband on the day of your birth.
You made a heaven for me on Earth".
She should've seen Mr. Heaven on Earth in surgery yesterday putting a nurse on report for giving him the instrument that he asked for.
Thank you, Mrs. Burns, from the bottom of my foot.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hi, Frank.
That supposed to be clever?
- Happy birthday, Frank.
- And many more, bunkie.
We were gonna buy you something, but we couldn't get to the 5-and-10 yen store.
Buy me something?
You guys are so full of prunes!
Now I know what to get you: An electric bra.
That tears it!
Where is it?
What filthy whatever have you done with my wife's birthday card?
I don't know how to tell you this, Frank, but your wife's birthday card is having a thing with my right foot.
That's it!
I want that card out of your boot pronto!
And that's an order!
You better do what he says.
He could revoke your feet.
- How much do you want for your boots?
- What?
I'll give you 50 dollars and the Ten Commandments in pig latin.
Go peddle your papers!
There's only one thing left to do, Hawk.
I think we should go lean on the supply sergeant.
Very good advice from a man who zipped his fly to new heights.
I got you in here, Doc.
I know.
I remember.
- 101/2-C boot.
- Right.
101/2-Charlie.
Here we are.
Right next to Captain Milligan's truss.
He never got it.
He was shipped home weeks ago.
I hope he had somebody carry his bags for him.
You want the truss if it comes in?
If it's a 101/2-C.
Sergeant Zale, I'm a doctor.
I've been operating for a week standing on one foot.
I'm warning you, you're looking at a desperate flamingo.
- You see that hole?
- So?
I find it a little mind-boggling that I can't get a 101/2-C boot.
You want to see a 101/2-C hole?
Look at this.
Huh?
For weeks I've been asking the dentist to fix this, and he's too busy.
What do you think?
That's a hole.
Unfortunately, we're not dentists, - but your tonsils don't look too good.
- Let us snip 'em out.
No chance!
I need them to chew with.
Sergeant, if we can arrange your dental work, you think you just might be able to expedite the 101/2-Charlies?
You get me a 20/20 mouth, and I'll find you a pair of boots so fast it'll make your feet swim.
Attention.
Captain Alvin Mercer leaves for a honeymoon in Tokyo at 0900 hours.
Any nurse wishing to be the bride, please contact the captain.
No experience necessary.
Klinger, stop fidgeting.
Sit back.
- It hurts my head.
- May I ask why you're wearing curlers?
- I'm going on guard duty tonight.
- Klinger, when are you gonna wise up?
You been trying to get out of the army by wearing dresses.
What's it got you?
Two proposals and a hurt letter from a peeping Tom.
- Who was it?
- I don't undress and tell.
- Pierce, Mclntyre.
- Konnichiwa, Dr. Futterman-san.
The sun smiles, the river laughs.
Can't help lovin' that man of mine.
Klinger, how can you wear just a skirt on a cold day like this?
You think it's easy being a nut?
- Bernie - Open wide.
I have to ask you a favor before you go down to the pits.
You know the supply sergeant, Zale?
Zale.
Yeah.
- What about him?
- I want you to give him his bridge.
In two words: "uhm-possible".
That's cosmetic work.
I got people here with sick teeth.
Bernie, look at this.
I don't do shoes.
You'll have to get them filled somewhere else.
Bernie, I'm at your mercy.
I'm wearing my foot on my sleeve.
Do Zale's teeth, and he gets new boots.
Fair enough.
If you help me.
I'm in love.
Just name her.
She's yours.
We'll bring her here in chains.
We'll even give her a drug that makes you look tall and blond.
Gentlemen, it's not a woman.
It's Japan.
I love that land, from the top of Fujiyama to the bottom of its sea, where even right now chubby half-naked diving girls are irritating oysters to produce pearls.
Makes you want to enlist in the oysters.
I know I'm Japanese.
I was born Japanese.
I have a feeling that I was kidnapped by a dentist whose wife was barren and spirited away to East Orange.
My life there has only been prologue to my final destiny: Underwater dentist in an all-night bathhouse.
Uh, look, we're good, but we can't get you a transfer toJapan.
I only want three days.
I wanna visit a Shinto shrine.
I wanna see the Kabuki.
I wanna spend an evening with a girl I can think about in years to come when my wife is talking to me.
Okay.
We'll see Henry.
Henry?
In the great mouth of life, Henry Blake is but a temporary filling.
Okay, sir, uh, you sign this top form, then initial all the rest.
- Initial, Radar?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Your initials signify that instead of signing, you initialed.
Uh, then you have to sign this form, which states that you merely initialed the forms that required signing.
Then after you've signed, you put your initial where you signed so that people will know that you okayed your signature with your initial.
Radar, tell me the truth.
Do you understand any of this?
Uh, I try not to, sir.
It slows up the work.
Anything else?
Uh, oh!
There's these more here too, sir.
Oh, pooh!
I got a bucket of golf balls to wash.
Hey.
Three nurses want to transfer out?
Oh, yes, sir.
They're really in tough shape.
It's sad to see 'em crying in the shower.
Radar, you were supposed to fix the hole in that tent.
Uh, I did, sir, but it just took a week longer than I expected.
Major Houlihan, huh?
Yes, sir.
She's really giving them a bad time.
The queen of the bedpans strikes again!
There's also something more you should know too, sir.
What?
Major Houlihan's preparing a very bad report about you for General Mitchell.
How do you know that?
Well, when I was cleaning out her wastebasket I accidentally came upon this piece of paper, which she had been typing with the wrong side of the carbon facing.
So I pressed it with a steam iron to transfer what she wrote onto this piece of paper.
I could see what she wrote without holding up her mistake to a mirror.
That was a terrific accident, Radar.
Thank you, sir.
"Incompetent, inefficient, unmilitary".
- She spelled "bungler" wrong.
- Uh, no, that's "bumbler," sir.
Oh, then she got it right.
Boy, that gripes my cookies!
What has she got against me?
I've never done a thing to that woman.
Maybe that's it, sir.
Oh, no.
Not without combat pay.
- Are you in, Henry?
- I'm in enough to ask you to get out.
- Bad mood today.
- That's right.
I'm in a bad mood today.
- Wow!
What ears.
- What's up, Henry?
Houlihan's got the nurses so crazy, half of'em can't sleep at night.
Yeah?
Which ones?
She's also preparing a report to General Mitchell, where I could wind up shaving patients before surgery.
I guess this is a wrong time to ask you for a favor, huh, Henry?
Not unless you want it turned down.
Then it's ideal.
- It's for Futterman, the dentist.
- The closet Oriental.
If you give him three days in Tokyo, I can get a new pair of boots.
I'd be lying if I said I understood that.
I'd also be lying if I said I cared.
What if we can get Hot Lips off your back?
I'd give Futterman a week.
He could run for emperor.
It never fails.
One hand washes the other.
You fix that sweetheart, and I'll give you a bath.
That part of our relationship is over, Henry.
Henry Blake is a sham commander, a farcical administrator and a spineless, irresponsible, lecherous old beanbag.
Margaret, we're not gonna get anywhere if you keep holding back.
- My report is going to Gen.
Mitchell.
- Come on, reconsider.
Henry's less than perfect, but we are a team.
Yeah, it's just that he's been in one too many scrimmages without his helmet.
- Margaret, what can we do?
- What you can do mostly is not.
Not torment Frank Burns.
All right, you have our word.
He will never find meat loaf in his pajamas again!
We'll never add another number to his dog tags.
He will never again wake up with nail polish and mascara.
Not good enough, gentlemen.
Not good enough!
- Today is Frank's birthday.
- Yeah, yeah?
I think a surprise party in the mess tent tonight, with a big cake and at least 20 people and presents might just stop my report.
- It's a deal.
- It is not!
I have just run out of hypocrisy.
My dignity tank is getting dangerously low.
You expect me to drag for Frank Burns and paint smiles on their faces?
And presents?
Half this camp spends its time sticking pins in little Frank Burns dolls.
I will debase myself just so far for a pair of boots.
Hah!
A party for Frank Burns?
I think I'll start with a few hors d'oeuvres, followed by baked ham and hot biscuits.
If they'll stay hot.
That's the only problem.
- Radar, what are you doing?
- Sorting the mail.
- Otherwise known as a sneak preview.
- Anything for us?
No.
What do you guys want, sirs?
A birthday cake for Frank Burns.
- You gonna start bein' nice to him now?
- We thought we'd try it.
- If he likes it, we can always stop.
- Well, what do you need me for?
- Why don't you talk to the cook?
- We had a little falling out.
We sent a sample of his stew to the lab.
It came back marked "benign no traces of food".
Radar, you do this for us, and I promise I'll find a cure for shortness.
Now, that's not funny!
Hey, you know he's only joking.
Yeah.
In our hearts, you're six-foot-three.
Yeah, I know.
I'm just kinda edgy lately.
Guess it's my, uh, loneliness.
Which one is she?
That new first lieutenant.
The big blond lady.
Murphy?
The wonder nurse?
She's two people taller than you.
Be smart, Radar.
Start in the boys' department.
Work your way up to the men's floor.
Give us a little time.
We'll find you something in 32 regular.
I don't have time.
The Medical Journal says a man's best years are between 19 and 25.
- Right now I'm at my peak, physically.
- Oh.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Hey, Radar, forget about Murphy.
What about, uh, uh, Nurse Anderson?
She's built like a brick hospital.
- Murphy.
- What about NurseJacobs?
She's offered her body to science time and time again.
- Murphy.
- Murphy.
- Murphy.
Please, fellas, I'm tired.
I'm in no mood for kidding.
- We just need a little favor.
- Why didn't you say so?
The answer's no.
Look, we need to borrow your body for an evening.
- Your heart doesn't have to be in it.
- Is that unreasonable?
I wish somebody would make me that offer.
We have this terrific friend who's really anxious to go out with you.
He's sort of a shy, Gary Cooper-ish type.
Well, he's a little more "ish" than "Cooper".
But he's extremely bright in the head, where that kind of thing counts.
- Warm and witty.
- Excitingly average.
- Okay.
- Okay?
What kind of a turndown is that?
He can meet me in my tent after ward duty.
Don't you want to know how you'll recognize him?
Oh, I'll know.
He'll be the one with the dryer.
The what?
Part of this deal has to be that I have a hair dryer.
I'm tired of walking through this war with wet hair.
And that's all there is to it?
Listen, for a hair dryer, I'd even go out with Radar O'Reilly.
We can't send a kid like Radar up with a girl like that.
Maybe if I took a real hot bath, I could fit into his clothes.
- 75 bucks.
That's as high as I go.
- Nope.
All right, a hundred bucks and I'll throw in a nose job.
You implying my nose is too big?
Not at all.
I'll even add to it if you want.
I'll give you a nose that'll need a tie clip.
I need this dryer.
There's only one thing I want, and everybody knows it.
Klinger, it's not in our power to give you a discharge.
Ah!
I looked it up.
If I can get four officers that'll sign that I'm a nutcase, I can get out.
I'd sign a paper certifying you're an English sheepdog.
Providing you stay on the paper.
I knew you guys would do it!
When it comes to crazy, you're tops.
But what's the use?
Majors Burns or Houlihan, they wouldn't sign.
Now, wait a minute.
Maybe we can soften them up.
- We're giving him a party.
- For his birthday.
The same guys that glued his head to a pillow last week?
Hey, trust us.
We'll get him mellow.
- He'll sign your nutso-gram.
- You get ready for the party.
And tell me what you're wearing so we don't clash.
- What is it?
- Open it up!
Ohh!
It was my father's.
He was cavalry.
A riding crop!
My mother gave it to him on their wedding night.
Margaret, you're a dreamboat!
- Frank!
- Giddy-up!
- You're silly.
- Ohh!
Margaret, I'm so grateful you remembered my birthday.
I'm not the sort of person whose birthday people seem to remember.
I'm just sort of there year after year.
- Oh, Frank.
- Yeah.
When I was little, my mother used to send out 30 birthday invitations just to get four kids to show up.
I know.
You told me.
Why don't people like me, Margaret?
Well - Have some wine, Frank.
- They don't, you know.
I've gotten thank-you notes from people I said I'd never see again.
- Well, do you know what we're gonna do?
- Hmm?
We're going over to the mess tent for a birthday dinner.
Just the two of us.
Just you and me.
Just the two of us.
Isn't that sad?
- Majors at two o'clock!
- Okay, everybody get down!
Be quiet!
Hide!
Shh!
Shh!
- Hawkeye, is that your hand?
- Is what my hand?
Pipe down!
Shh!
Quiet!
- Say, what's - Surprise!
Surprise!
Oh, this isn't all for me.
Sure it is, you silly goose.
Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank.
- Well put, Henry.
- Frank.
It's very hard to tell people how much you like them.
Very hard.
Some people even harder than others.
Frank, this is a very tough case.
Thank you.
Colonel Blake's stretcher, please.
Hey, come on, Henry.
There's a bottle dying to meet you.
Aw, you two palookas.
- Thanks, Pierce.
- A deal's a deal.
- Speech, Frank!
Speech!
- Yes!
Uh, I'm not, uh, much at speechifying.
Uh, this party's really thrown me for a loop.
I'd, uh, just like to say that I think you're all a bunch of swell eggs.
Uh, of course, a few of the eggs are a little cracked.
Biggest horse's patoot in the army.
Uh, Frank, we have some presents for you.
- Radar, give Frank a drink.
- Yeah, come on.
Not too much, Frank.
It makes you sluggish.
Now, this first present is from all the gang in X-Ray.
It's practical as well as ornamental.
A pair of lead-lined jockey shorts.
Let's see what else we have here.
-  - Hey!
Tomorrow morning, Doc, in regards to my teeth?
The dawn awakens the soul.
The soul summons the spirit.
- What time?
- Soon as I get back from the latrine.
- Be in my chair, 10:00.
Don't be late.
- You got it.
A rare gift, Frank, from old Heidelberg.
A medical student's specimen stein.
Margaret, this is the best party I ever had.
Major Houlihan seems in good spirits.
She's gonna be one peroxide pussycat from now on.
And you can thank yours anonymously for that.
Really?
How'd you like to come to my tent and thank me in person?
You're married, aren't you?
Well, that's all right.
So's my wife.
- Hey, Klinger, what time you got?
- Five to 8:00.
Geez, I gotta get outta here.
I got a date.
- Yeah?
With who?
- Nurse Murphy.
You gonna work without a net?
Now may we have the, uh   - They love you, Frank.
- It was their hatred that fooled me.
Make a wish, Frank.
Pierce, Mclntyre, this is the happiest night of my life, buddies.
You want to share the happiness, Frank?
- With the whole world.
- Sign this.
- With the whole world.
- Sign this.
Sure.
What is it?
Never!
You're asking me to let a pervert out of the army?
Oh, right, Frank.
By all means, let's keep the perverts in the army.
- Klinger's not a pervert!
- How do you know?
Because I'm one, and he's never at the meetings.
- That's despicable!
- Hey, she's tearing up my crazy papers!
Hey, what are you doing?
-  - Hey!
What's going on here?
And what are you doing here?
But didn't they tell you?
I'm your date.
Only if you plug yourself in and blow on my hair.
This is your party, and you're going to enjoy it whether you like it or not.
Now, come on.
Everybody's watching.
Cut the cake.
- I can't.
- Act like a man, you twit!
A deal's a deal!
Wait.
Before we operate on that cake, I would like to get a second opinion.
This will all go into my report to the general, Colonel DrunkyJohn.
Henry, go fall down on somebody.
Margaret - It'll all be reported!
- Oh, boy.
If I don't see you before I leave, thank you for the three-day pass, Colonel-san.
In case you haven't heard, Captain, there's a war going on-san.
Henry, wait a second!
I gotta talk to you.
- Henry, may I talk to you?
- Where did I lose control?
See ya bright and early, Doc.
Forget it.
Sleep late.
And learn how to gum your food.
I'm not going into your mouth unless it catches fire.
- I appeal to you as a fellow doctor.
- Bernie, please!
- We're sorry about Pearl Harbor!
- It'll never happen again!
- Don't go, Sergeant.
- Out of my way, sir.
That's an order.
- He's got to have those boots.
- We made a deal.
He didn't come through.
Do you know what I did?
How I degraded myself, how I groveled, how I humbled, how I cheapened myself all for a pair of miserable, lousy army boots?
I swear to you, as dedicated as I am to the sanctity and preservation of human life, if I had a gun at this moment, I would send my head across the tent!
A gun takes six weeks.
There's a terrific waiting list.
Look, Sergeant, what if we got you an appointment with the dentist?
Yeah.
I happen to know he's not going to Tokyo.
But if we got him a three-day pass, then Hot Lips won't report Henry.
On the other hand, if we get Radar a date with the hair dryer  Let's get some chow.
You go.
I don't feel like it.
Tough breakin' in, huh?
It takes awhile.
I'll do it.
Well, you gotta start sometime.
Come on.
Okay.
- Wonder what garbage they got today.
- What's the difference?
Fore!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
- Where was I?
- Um "To General Mitchell, H.Q. Seoul.
"Subject: Reply to report of conduct unbecoming a commanding officer, filed by Majors Houlihan and Burns".
Boy, those two poops are gonna drive me dippy.
Yes, sir.
All right.
Here we go.
While it is true that during our recent Mardi Gras celebration I did appear as King Neptune, I wish to point out that the costume worn by said King Neptune covered my body completely from the waist down, including your pelvic region.
"Including your pelvic region".
Right, pelvic region.
Furthermore, and to wit - To what?
- To wit.
The rhinestone I wore in my belly button offended nobody.
- Is "belly button" one word, sir?
- Hmm?
Is "belly button" one word?
Radar, the good Lord gave us one belly and one button for said belly.
- Therefore, it is two words.
- Two.
- Belly button.
Good boy.
- Belly button.
- Thank you, sir.
- Welcome.
And, uh, in conclusion, I think a little relaxation is essential for my men and I. - Or should that be "me"?
- Should what be "me," sir?
- Should "l" be "me"?
- Do you have any choice?
Never mind.
Where was I?
Ten-hut!
- What is it?
- Sir, request permission to return prisoner Private Daniel Baker to your custody, sir.
All right.
I'll handle it from here on, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Oh!
What are you trying to do to me?
- Radar - Here's his file, sir.
It just isn't fair, Baker.
I'm going flat out all the time just trying to run this squirrel cage, without the aggravation of you going A.W.O.L.
Every ten minutes.
- It just isn't fair.
- Yes, sir.
Well, what is it, son?
You get ice cream on Sundays, no bed check, movies.
- We had The Thing and The Blob both in one week.
- Yes, sir!
I mean, if it weren't for the war, we'd be really having a good time.
Although, what the hell we'd be doing over here without a war, I can't tell you.
So, maybe it's just as well there's one going on - if you follow the way I've drifted.
- Yes, sir.
Well It's more than quite clear that your case calls for stern measures.
The only problem is I'm just not good at discipline, you know?
I mean, it took me over six months to housebreak my dog.
Of course, there was a newspaper strike at the time.
I just don't know what to do with you.
- Uh, this message just came in, sir.
- Oh, thank you.
I'm gonna send you to Father Mulcahy.
He can be a big help.
- Did you ever hear him speak?
- I don't go to his services, sir.
Oh, I don't either.
I avoid church religiously.
He's a good man.
A very wise man.
He's a good man.
A very wise man.
Now, just relax, son.
Okay, Father, but I think you should know I'm not a Catholic.
Nobody's perfect, my boy.
If it makes you more comfortable forget I'm a priest.
Let's just "kick it around," as they say.
- Man to man.
- I can't talk about it.
Well, I'm very good at keeping secrets.
Why, there's some things I won't even tell myself.
- What is it, son?
- You're looking at it.
I don't think I follow.
You're staring at it, like everybody does, Father, only you're too polite to say anything.
- If it's your nose - What else could it be?
There's only the three of us in here.
My son, we're all made in God's image.
Then he must have a schnoz the size ofTexas.
Oh, forgive me, Father.
But do you know what it is to live with a blower like this?
It's ruining my life.
I think you're making it the repository of all your troubles.
I keep running away to hospitals to get a nose job, but they won't touch me.
- How about our doctors here?
- They only operate if you're wounded.
What do I do, stick a grenade up my nose?
Not that it hasn't got room for it.
Come with me, Danny.
The sending of you to me only reinforces my opinion of Colonel Blake.
Oh, just wanna mark my place.
"Jawbone of an ass".
Baker, all a nose is is a nose.
It takes in air, and it breaks up the space between your eyes and your mouth.
It has nothing to do with a person's value or quality.
It's there to catch a cold through, or at which to look down on people from.
Enjoy it.
You've been given a good, strong, aquiline nose.
That went back for seconds.
I like it.
It's got character.
Yeah, it's got a sort of assertive je ne sais quoi.
And it arrives everywhere five minutes ahead of me.
You don't have a copyright on it.
There are plenty of great people with big probosci.
You know why Napoleon always kept his hand down here?
He was scratching his nose.
Look.
I appreciate, and you're only trying to make me feel better.
It's only true.
You don't have to live with the jokes.
"Excuse me, but my bus is late and it's raining.
Mind if I stand under your nose"?
"Ever thought of putting in an attic"?
At my draft board, the guy next to me says, "You could be 4-F.
Just tell 'em you're an anteater".
- What about it?
- The point is, kid, we're not plastic surgeons.
Yeah, it's not a tough operation, but it's a specialty.
I mean, we don't just want to "denosify" you.
We want it done right.
- It's also against regulations.
- You think this is regulation?
Please.
What happens after the army?
What happens with the rest of my life?
What about girls?
Ever think of that?
All the time.
There's a lot of people who think a big nose is a sign of sexual potency.
- Sorry, Father.
- I just translate things like that into Latin.
Makes them sound noble.
Will you do it?
I'd even pay.
You sure?
We might charge you up to a dollar.
- Fifty cents a nostril.
- You guys serious?
We will set the trusty, rusty wheels of the army in motion.
Have faith, my boy.
Do you guys have any idea how much hot water I'm in already?
I mean, I'm in it right up to my rear bumpers.
- Give us a minute, Henry.
- No.
- You know Danny Baker?
- Yeah.
The kid who keeps going AWOL.
I swear he's just using us for his mailing address.
Have you ever noticed his nose, Henry?
Ooh, that's quite a hooter.
There's one bazoo that's begging for a salami slicer.
That's the trouble, Henry.
If he could get it bobbed, his problem would be over.
Cosmetic surgery is against army regulations.
Another good reason to do it.
This is the perfect time, Henry.
We haven't had any casualties for a week.
- You suppose the war is over and they haven't told us?
- Oh, don't be silly.
I was very specific at the draft board.
I said I need two weeks' notice to look for another war.
Henry, you know who's a major down at Tokyo General?
- Who?
- You ever hear of Stanley Robbins?
Yeah, sure, the plastic surgeon.
He does all those Hollywood people.
He's doing burn therapy and a bit of face-lifting for generals' wives.
- He does that?
- He's taken out enough puff from their eyelids to make a comforter.
He's an old friend of mine, Henry.
We did a residency together.
We could have him here in an hour, working on Baker's beak.
Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know about it.
You guys have my full permission, and I never said that.
I mean, I'm not even here, so how could I?
- Radar, make an entry - Sir?
In the daily report I wasn't here today and bring it to me so I can sign it.
If you sign it, it'll show you were here.
- Then you sign it for me.
- Yes, sir.
Should I sign your name?
You'll have to, 'cause I'm going to say it was a forgery.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, no sense hanging around if I'm not here.
Psst!
Major Stanley Robbins on the telephone, Tokyo General.
You sure you can get him up here?
No sweat.
I know just which button to push.
Hello, Stosh?
Hawkeye Pierce.
I didn't catch you in the middle of anybody, did I?
Good.
Uh, listen, uh No, everything's very slow around here.
Stosh, I wanna hit you for a favor.
We got We got a kid here with a with a nose that's right up your alley.
He really needs a job.
Oh, you're not free, huh?
Gee, that's a shame.
"The Barracuda" will really be disappointed.
Stosh, you and I have taken out some nurses in our time, but this is really Florence What-a-Nightengale.
Well, listen, if you can't make it you can't make it.
What?
See you in two hours.
- So long, Stosh.
- Uh, question.
- Yeah.
- Which nurse is "the Barracuda"?
As soon as he finds out, we'll be the first to know.
Hey!
Whoa!
Hey, Stosh, how you doing?
- Hawkeye, how's the action?
- TrapperJohn Mclntyre.
Stanley, pleasure.
Heard a lot about you.
Maybe we can be friends anyway.
Well, I've seen the garbage dump Where's the camp?
- This is it Downtown 4077.
- You guys gotta be kidding.
- This is a khaki slide area.
- Home away from home, Stosh.
If I were you, I'd call in an air strike, start all over again.
- Radar!
- Hi, Hawkeye.
Hi, Trapper.
Hi.
Hi.
- She's not the one.
- No.
She's not the one, no.
To you she's not the one.
What's wrong with a little appetizer?
- Radar, you wanna get the major's bag, please?
- Yes, sir.
See that face?
It can be saved.
- How's everything in Tokyo?
- Never stops.
Round the clock.
- Rough, huh?
- Sometimes I get in a little surgery.
Hey, who broke my doll?
I didn't know you guys had a mental ward.
That, Dr. Ripley, is our commanding officer.
Do I salute or test his reflexes?
Henry, Major Robbins.
Colonel Henry Blake.
- Oh, well, welcome aboard, Major.
- Thank you, sir.
So, you're the well-known "surgeon to the stars," huh?
Henry's very impressed with your work, Stosh.
You betcha, I am.
Done a lot of pulling and tightening on those movie people out there, have ya?
Which ones?
Gimme a name.
Just one name.
- Colonel, you're a doctor.
- Gotcha.
Ethics.
Then gimme some initials.
I'll take it from there.
- S.S. - S.S.?
- Um, male or female?
- Yeah.
- Um, Sylvia Sidney.
- No.
- Um, Slim Summerville?
- Beautiful.
- Um, Slim Summerville?
- Beautiful.
Sid Caesar!
Here you go, Stosh, the V.I.P. Tent.
- This is it?
- Yeah.
Where do you flush this room?
Stanley, let's remember what you're here for.
- All right, where is she?
- The nose first.
- Whatever she wants.
- I'll go round up Baker.
- Whatever she wants.
- I'll go round up Baker.
Hi, kids.
Slip into the wrong tent?
Ah, here are the very lovely Major Margaret Houlihan and the even lovelier Major Frank Burns.
- Major Stanley Robbins.
- Major.
- Major.
- Major.
Did anyone ever tell you, with a little work, you could have the jowls of a goddess?
- Oh, Major!
- Tremendous jowl potential.
We've all sure heard of you, Major Robbins.
Uh You know, jowls can be the most sensual part of a woman, after the soft underside of the kneecap.
Just relax, Major.
Honey.
This fatty tissue has to come off, of course.
- Uh, Stosh?
- To what do we owe the honor of this visit, Major?
Social.
We go way back.
Actually, he built me in his laboratory.
And it's time for his 3,000-mile checkup.
Turn your head and cough.
Nice of you two to pay your respects, but the major will only be here for a while, - so if you'll excuse us.
- Oh, certainly.
Great pleasure, Major.
If you ever wanna reach me, I'm at Tokyo General.
Just leave the message "jowls".
I'll know.
Very exciting type spatulate fingers.
One drink, they tear you apart.
- Save yourself for the big game, Stosh.
- Yeah, when do I meet her?
As soon as you chop a few feet off of Baker's nose.
A plastic surgeon in a field hospital.
Don't you think they're up to something sneaky?
Oh, if you do, I do, Frank.
I trust your sneaky instincts.
How does that one strike you?
And remember a nose job is not a haircut.
If you don't like it, it won't grow back.
- Gee, I don't know.
- Tres sportif.
I bet it cuts down on wind resistance.
Leave this to me, huh?
You two guys living in the armpit of the universe, and you're trying to help a world-famous artist.
- Can I see another one?
- Of course.
Gee, I never realized how hard it is to pick a nose.
Do me a favor, huh?
Big winner.
Very popular number.
This job paid for two Cadillacs.
I'd call that paying through the nose.
The wit in this tent flows like molasses.
All right, all right.
No hurry.
There's more.
-  Hey!
- You got taste, kid.
I got that one for my wife for her birthday.
We're in business.
All right, Hawk, where's "the Barracuda"?
Now, come on.
It's been hours.
I'm getting a headache.
Stosh, after the operation.
She's not going anyplace.
Yeah, we got her idling in neutral.
Watch it.
You happen to be talking about the woman I love.
When can we do this, Doc?
The sooner the quicker.
Gentlemen, synchronize your watches.
Operation Nose Lift is about to begin.
##  What am I signing, Radar?
Well, it's concerning that thing you don't wanna know anything about, sir.
You know, the reason why you're not here today.
- You want me to sign this pass?
- Yes, sir.
- Someone going somewhere?
- No, sir.
Then, why does someone who's not going anywhere need a pass?
- Well, if I explain it to you, then you'll know.
- Yeah.
- Also this, sir.
-  - Okay.
Radar?
- Thank you, sir.
Sir?
You're not going to wind up owning my car, are you?
No, sir.
Will that be all, sir?
If you say so.
##  I appreciate this pass, sir.
Can I bring you anything from Tokyo?
Yeah.
I'd like one of those hot-water bottles, - about 37-24-35.
- Yes, sir.
All right, Father!
Right, Father, baby!
Right down the middle here!
Hey there, Father, baby!
Hey, you got a good, strong arm there, Father.
Well, you develop a lot of muscle wrestling with temptation.
All right, right in the Hey!
Hey, Major Burns!
Oh!
Very good, Frank.
I want the windows on those doors covered.
- Yes, Doctor.
- We'll just need the one table.
- Once we start, nobody comes in.
- Right.
- I'm counting on you to keep quiet about this.
- I'll add it to the list.
Let's get it straight!
Right down the middle!
Burn it in here!
Oh!
Oh!
- Kid, are you okay?
- My nose!
- Let me see.
Maybe I can help.
- I don't think so, Frank.
He needs a doctor.
Corpsman!
- What's the big tzimmes here?
- He got hurt playing catch.
Poor lad.
Lucky for you, young man, I just happen to be in Korea against my will.
- I think it's broken!
- It does look like a break.
Don't worry, Radar.
We'll set it right away.
You'll be smelling again in a week.
- Get out of my way!
- Nice of you to offer to help, Frank, but you do realize we just happen to have Stanley Robbins here, one of the best nose men in the business.
- That's right!
- What an opportunity to observe!
Uh, well, Robbins never allows anybody to watch his work.
Sometimes even the patients can't get in.
- You're talking very fast, Captain.
- Try listening slow.
Attention.
Major Robbins report for emergency surgery.
Major Burns, report to the C.O. Major Houlihan, report to Supply.
Those are the major announcements for the day.
- How's it going?
- It's a great operation.
All we need is a doctor and a patient.
Sorry.
The door was blocked.
- Never mind.
Take your clothes off.
- For a nose job?
They say that to everybody.
If I sent for you, I would be the first to know.
Well, can you think of a reason why you might send for me?
Rarely, Frank, if ever even then.
- Well, that's ridiculous.
- The whole thing's dumb, Frank.
- Are you calling me dumb?
- You said it, I didn't.
- Come on.
- Where we gonna look?
The nurses' quarters.
Try every tent.
By the time he's finished, there won't be a misshapen feature in the whole outfit.
Except for Robbins himself.
Let me go!
Oh, you're an animal!
- Let me prove it to you.
- Stop it!
I'll scream!
You'll scream.
You'll holler.
You'll sing.
You'll become a symphony.
Major!
- How's Radar?
- Oh, he's fine, Father.
I'll explain later.
- I need Dr. Robbins.
- Well, seek and ye shall find.
They certainly foresaw every contingency.
Dr. Robbins in here?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Have you seen Oh, my goodness gracious.
-  - Tell me the truth, what's your nickname?
- No, that's a lie!
- You're "the Barracuda," right?
- No!
What?
- I've known hundreds of women, Major, - please be one of them.
- I'll crack you across the face with this!
- I knew I could count on you.
-  - Stosh!
- Oh!
I never thought I'd be glad to see you.
You chop him in half, you'll find your grandmother inside.
Doctor, please, let's remember who we are and what we're here for.
- Oh!
- Hey, Trap.
Major Houlihan just had her pulses taken by an octopus.
- Saint George time.
-  There, there, my Margaret.
Ain't nobody gonna harm y'all, lessin' you leave ol' Uncle Trapper's arms.
Oh!
You got a fast hand, Stosh.
First doctor in Beverly Hills to break the four-minute nose.
- Swab.
- Swab.
If I could work on your eyes for half an hour, you could be a star.
- I don't wanna be a star.
- Then just give me the half hour.
- Stanley, the patient, remember?
- If this guy thinks he's got problems, I've had noses that had to be wheeled in on two tables.
- Sponge.
- Sponge.
You got a nickname, honey?
What do they call you around here?
Hmm?
Well, they called me Red for a long time, but it was just because of my hair.
- Yeah, I'm holding.
- Be advised, Colonel, General Mitchell will hear about this in my weekly anonymous report.
- What are you doing here?
- I was drafted, sir.
Your nose is supposed to be broken.
Uh, yes.
Well, Dr. Pierce said it was just a sprain and if I keep off it for a month, I'll only have to put liquids in it.
I'm a doctor, and that's crazy.
I've heard that, sir.
I have bigger fish to catch than you.
Uh-Uh-Uh, Major, telephone.
It's your wife.
Your anniversary call.
- But that was last month.
- I just got through.
Louise?
Yes, it's me, darling.
How are you, sweetheart?
Oh, gosh, it's good to talk to you, honey.
- Who the hell is that?
- It's my wife!
What?
Uh Oh, Major Houlihan just came in.
Hi, Jim.
- Beautiful job, Stosh.
- Hmm.
Beautiful's the worst I can do.
Back home, that half hour would have cost you a grand.
But because I like you and respect you, it'll only cost you one big nurse.
Or two small ones, and I'll give you change.
All right, Pierce.
There's nothing wrong with Radar.
Who did you just operate on?
- Surgery on the nose can't be hidden, mister.
- He's right, you know.
- Everything roger, Doctor?
- Roger and dodger, Doctor.
You'll all be in the clink, soon as we find out who you performed surgery on illegally.
Great jowls.
Great.
Stosh, you came through like a trouper.
- We really appreciate it.
- You're thanking me?
I've been the recipient of a farewell I may have to write up in a medical paper.
- If I live.
Ciao.
-  So long, Stosh.
Hey, Virginia, this is a "Barracuda".
Girls, anybody here know, uh, Stanley Robbins?
Do you know anybody who knows anybody who knows Robbins?
Anybody have a nickname here that
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
## -  Lap sponge.
-  Lap sponge.
-  Hey, Sam, can you see all right?
- Perfect.
- Lieutenant, put this man under.
- I want you to observe this technique.
- Kellye, get some more pulls out quick!
- Clamp!
Clamp!
Come on!
Move a little bit to your right, will you?
Okay, where are the bolts for it?
Hey, Sam, how about this?
Um, "Give him a bicarbonate, and tell him to stay off his feet".
Isn't that "Your presence is welcome in our camp"?
No, it's "your uncle has gas from eating cabbage".
I think you're ready for the U.N.
Captain Pak, you are here as a medical observer, not to give us language lessons.
Oh, I know, Sam.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
-  What?
Well, your uncle with the gas is now pregnant.
-  - Hey, terrific!
Oh, jabber-jabber-jabber-jabber.
What's Korean for "quack"?
"Quack"?
That's my father-in-law's name.
- Frank, you're a father-in-law.
Saline for irrigation.
- Saline.
Frank, by a strange coincidence, the inhabitants of Korea communicate in Korean.
It wouldn't hurt us to speak their language.
I speak American.
And I can go anyplace in the world.
We can have you packed in 20 minutes.
We're living in Korea, Frank.
Clamp.
- Clamp.
- Not me, fella.
Hmm.
I'm part of the American military establishment.
I eat in an American mess.
I shop in an American P.X. All I wanna do is save these people and go home.
And we thank you from the bottom of our bomb craters.
- I don't need any of your lip.
- "Lip" is Sam's cousin.
Oh, pish-posh.
"Pish-posh"?
That's my mother's family.
##  -  - Yo!
Come in.
Morning, Radar.
Cheese and crackers!
Uh, now just take it easy, Bossy.
Nobody's gonna hurt you, sweetie.
Radar!
Sit!
Sit, lady!
Stay!
- Radar!
- Sir, there's a Korean family out here.
Well, their dog's in here.
Holy cow!
Never mind his religion, Radar.
Just get him outta here.
Shine, Joe?
Shine, Joe?
Shine, Joe?
Shine, Joe?
Shine, Joe?
Shine?
Shine?
Shine, Joe?
Shine, Joe?
Shine, Joe?
Hey, mister.
Hey, fella!
Look, friend.
You can't build your hooch here.
Hospital.
Hospital.
Yo!
Yo!
You're on government property.
Go home.
Go-ey home-y.
Go-ey home-y.
Uh, Radar.
Here, tell him, will you?
Uh  Go-ey home-y.
Oh, that's just dandy, Radar.
Look, folks.
You've picked a very busy spot.
The war comes through here.
Well, not war in your war-fighting sense, but rather in your aftermath sense, which is still war-war.
Uh, not now, sonny.
Uh, people, we can't have this.
What the deuce is going on here, Colonel?
What are these people doing?
Oh, Frank, will you for pete's sake, for heaven's sake?
I'm up to my naval in locals.
Exactly why, I'm not sure.
The only thing I am sure of is I don't need you.
Well, why are they building a house?
I don't know, Frank.
Maybe they were thrown out of their hotel.
How should I know?
Radar, go get - Captain Pak is on his way, sir.
- Uh, look.
- You natives -  Now hear this!
You can't build a house on a U.S. Military reservation.
- Now amscray!
Scat!
Great going, Frank.
Now you've aggravated them, you dumb dodo.
I had the situation under control before you got here.
Could I have my leg back, please?
Colonel, these people are poachers.
I'd say fire a few shots over their heads.
That'll chase 'em.
What do you wanna do, Frank, start a military incident in the middle of a war?
- Is that what you want?
- There are times when a show of strength - is the only way.
- Frank?
Just ran into Teddy Roosevelt.
Says he won't charge up the hill without you.
Hey, what's the problem?
- Looks like we got visitors.
- Well, they just moved in.
Started setting up housekeeping.
You gotta talk to 'em, Sam.
Get the first month's rent in advance.
I mean, we got a real hoo-ha goin' here.
Excuse me.
Any of you folks Catholic?
Father, do you mind?
Hold it.
- What's the poop, Sam?
- Well, the poop is he says that this is his farm and you are on his land.
That settles it.
Let's go home.
Are we just gonna stand around and let these foreigners take over the 4077 th?
Frank's right.
After all, this is their land.
What right have they got to it?
Hell's bells, Major!
The 4077 th is a field hospital.
Well, we can't handle it!
It's up to you Civilian Affairs boys.
That's what you're paid for.
Yeah, I know.
$640 a month isn't real money, but it does keep the old bulldog from barking.
Yeah.
Radar, will you do something with him before he gives me a pedicure?
Yo, I'm right here, Major.
Right, five of them.
Mom, Dad, three youngsters and an ox that's bucking for elephant.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Okay, boy.
Great shoe shine.
Here you go.
Candy?
Dollar for shine, Joe.
- Colonel, he wants a dollar.
- Well, pay him.
- Uh, take it out of petty cash.
- Sir, you took it all.
Uh, j-just hold it.
Radar, get him some grub.
Oh, yes, sir.
I don't know their names!
They're just your garden-variety Korean refugee, and they keep yelping that we're on their farm!
Yeah.
Well, listen.
Get up here and straighten this out, will ya?
Okay.
"Goom-bye".
Gee!
My name Choon Hi.
Oh.
Hi.
You're not with those others, are you?
I mean, you speak our verbiage.
I learn from the nuns.
Oh.
Oh!
Hi, little fella.
Little fella?
You gonna grow up and be a big Korean soldier, just like Daddy?
- His name Su Yong.
- Oh.
- Father is a soldier.
- Uh-huh.
- Not Korean soldier.
- Oh.
His father is G.I. Joe.
Well, I'm afraid we don't have anybody by that name here, Miss.
Su Yong father speak nice to me, like wind song.
Well, some of our guys can really shovel the old wind song.
- His father not just guy.
- Yeah?
He doctor.
MASH 4077.
Well, that's our phone number.
And you say he could really talk up the old wind song, eh?
Pierce and/or Mclntyre.
- Sir?
- Yo.
I took the children and got them some chow, but we better order some more rubber boots, 'cause we got ox problems.
- Where?
- You name it.
Oh, that's one more thing on my hands.
All right.
Get Pierce and Mclntyre over here on the double.
- Yes, sir.
- Henry.
- Yeah?
- Good news.
- I'll take it.
I had a long, reasonable talk with the farmer.
Everything's cool.
- Great.
- You got three days to get the hell outta here.
Sam, what's Korean for "suicide"?
That's theJapanese.
We don't do that shtick.
You wanna step in my office for another goody?
Sam, this is Miss Choon Hi.
The baby is Su Yong.
- You?
- Stand by for the fingering of the father.
- Aha.
- Him not doctor.
You betcha.
I don't make house calls.
Well, Sheriff, looks like you got troubles right here in Pregnant City.
- Thanks a lot.
- Gimme the key.
- You called, Master?
- This better be good, Henry.
- It's pretty tough getting across the compound.
-  Captain Pierce, Captain Mclntyre, I believe one of you knows Miss Choon Hi just a little bit better than the other one of you knows Miss Choon Hi.
Miss Hi claims that she and one of our doctors committed parenthood.
Any volunteers?
I got the forms for the boots, sir.
Him doctor!
Radar?
Radar!
-  -  - What's that?
- Mazel tov.
She's applied for legal aid to theJudge Advocate General, naming Dr. O'Reilly here as the father.
Radar.
Radar.
Radar.
- Our little boy has grown up, Henry.
- I have not!
Well, what do you have to say about Exhibit "A," which is at this moment having a drink at the bar?
- It's not mine!
- The mother says it is.
Well, what does she know?
I mean, she's mixing me up with somebody else.
That's possible.
You all look alike to us.
Come on, Radar.
Level.
Could you be the father?
Of course I could, but I'm not.
I mean, I do, but I didn't.
- Do you admit that you know her?
- Sure I know her.
She's from the village.
I've run into her a few times.
- Well, once, anyway.
- No!
Never!
You'd better be telling the truth, Radar.
They're sending someone from theJudge Advocate to question you.
- I'm not worried.
- Radar, why would she pick on you?
- Of all people.
- Now what is that crack?
Just 'cause I don't fool around like you guys doesn't mean I don't fool around like you guys.
I mean, well, you know, I'm pretty well-known in that village.
- I'm down there every Saturday night.
- Playing doctor.
Radar.
Radar.
Radar.
- Colonel?
- Frank, this is no time to reenlist.
You have no idea how it disgusts me to find myself here.
We share your disgust, Frank.
That farmer and his family are making a shambles out of the compound.
How can you make a shambles out of a shambles?
These people are your people.
They oughta get down on the ground and kiss their lucky stars above that we are over here spilling our blood to keep them safe from democracy.
And doing a hell of a job.
Frank, will you just keep your pants on?
I've got a call in to Civilian Affairs.
Meanwhile, you're just going to sit there and watch a girl nurse a baby?
Is that girl nursing a baby?
No, that's a child doing maternal chin-ups.
What the blue blazes is going on here?
She claims Radar's the father.
You dirty little noncom!
Frank, you've got a baby.
- Three.
- Well, I'm married.
And I'm an officer.
Perhaps you can help me, Officer.
I've just been robbed.
Sir, that baby is not mine, sir.
Oh, hogwash.
That's what they all say.
Just check the baby's blood and the mother's against his type, and you'll know P.D.Q. - Very good, Frank.
- Brilliant!
It's outrageous!
Cooking, sewing, farming.
-  It's called staying alive, Frank.
- They can't do that.
Not on a U.S. American military post.
Frank, why don't you call the Civilian Affairs officer?
- Me, sir?
- Yeah, I talked with him.
The man makes no sense, and you're very good at that.
Yes, sir!
Thank you, sir!
- Go get 'em, Frank.
Kill!
- Right!
- It isn't gonna hurt him, is it?
- Of course not.
I'll have you know I've drawn more blood in my time than Dracula on a blind date.
- It's gonna be all right.
- Okay, pal, here we go.
- You ever think of pediatrics?
- Oh, you make a fortune.
There's gold in them thar diapers.
And -  - You said you weren't gonna hurt him!
Oh, Radar, Radar.
You're acting like a nervous father.
Oh, it's just that he's so little.
Well, like father, like son.
- Will you cut that out!
- We'll know in a minute.
We're going to match the mother's blood type and the baby's blood type - against yours.
- He's "B".
- Stop peeking at my blood.
- And if the baby's blood type doesn't match yours, you're off the hook.
- And if it does?
- Then that means it's possible.
In which case you either marry the young lady and take financial responsibility, or if you want the easy way out, we can adopt you and hide you in the attic.
We'll get back to you.
- You wanna save us the trouble?
- I'm not worried.
- You understand the implications?
- I do.
Remember that phrase.
- You're not mad?
-  Oh, it's a little unexpected.
- You like the baby?
- Oh, yeah.
I like all babies.
Sure is a great way to start a life.
- Hi, Radar.
- You son of a gun, you.
Takin' the family out to lunch?
Oh, you jokers.
- How about that?
-  Here.
This is for you.
It's sort of like food.
Oh, uh, would you like me to Hey, uh, not so fast.
The ice cream won't melt into the cole slaw for a while yet.
Very spicy.
Better go easy on that stuff, Father.
Melt your beads.
Whoo-wee!
It'll clear your sinus too.
-  Colonel Blake?
- Yo!
First Lieutenant Harper, sir.
Oh, you're just in the nick of time.
I'll tell you something.
I got a split-level packin' crate goin' up, every boot's been shined within an inch of its life and that ox over there is two years behind in its fertilizer orders.
- Which one is pregnant, sir?
- Oh, he's here for the flip side, Henry.
Judge Advocate General.
Uh, Lieutenant Harper, this is Captain Pak, R.O.K. And this is Lieutenant Mulcahy, G-O-D.
Well, let's get crackin'.
Major, I certainly do appreciate the swift and decisive manner in which you attacked this matter.
Just between us majors, Major, Colonel Blake is not your clutch-type colonel.
Whatever he puts his hand to goes kerflooey!
This whole camp is on the fritz.
Well, many thanks again.
Hey, you're my kind of fella.
Hey, maybe we can get together sometime.
You know, I have a feeling that we're very much alike.
What?
I beg your pardon!
I'm a married man!
I've got kids and everything.
No, I won't call you again, and don't you ever call me!
- Major.
- Hmm?
- Well, I got results, even if you didn't, Colonel.
- Fine, Frank, fine.
- Don't you wanna hear about my call?
- One disaster at a time, Frank.
Right now we have to find out whether to buy a card for Radar this Father's Day.
If we were in the navy, I'd have you flogged.
Colonel, if you don't mind, I'd like to interview the complainant first.
- Radar.
-  - Radar.
-  You're dismissed until your presence is re-required.
- Where should I go?
- Try out.
- Out?
- Out, Radar, as in "not in".
Oh, that out.
Now, this is the statement which bears your signature.
You first met Corporal Radar O'Reilly on 15 September.
All right.
The party's over.
Repeat, the party is over.
Comprende?
We're combing you out of Uncle Sam's beard.
Sergeant.
And don't let them try to kid you.
They understand every word I'm saying.
And if they don't, the ox can translate.
- He's the only one listening.
- Where are they gonna go, Frank?
There's a truck on its way from Civilian Affairs.
Until we move on, they'll be allowed to farm the next field.
-  - Frank, the next field is a minefield.
They'll have to plow it with a tweezer.
Frank, your head needs work.
Look, Pierce.
I appreciate the unfairness of this entire unfortunate unfairness.
I mean, no one hates this war better than I do.
Why don't we leave it to the army to do the right thing?
I mean, they've been in this war business a long time.
Frank, they are not going to board that truck!
Until we know where they're going.
Captains do not order majors!
It's all my fault.
I failed him.
- You're not his father, Henry.
- No, as commanding officer.
Sam, have you ever heard me give the camp a sex orientation lecture?
- No.
- Oh, man!
I really get the joint rocking.
A kid like Radar gets worked up awful easy.
Save me a couple of seats for the next one.
- Colonel.
- Yo.
- I'm ready to talk to the corporal now.
- You got it.
Stop the presses, Henry!
- Everything all right?
- Oh, just fine.
We just finished typing the blood.
Corporal O'Reilly has blood type "B".
For proof, I refer you to his egg-encrusted dog tags.
The mother has blood type "O," and the aforeborn baby has blood type "A".
Radar is no more the father of that child than Trapper here.
- I have blood type "B".
-  Colonel, who are these gentlemen, please?
Oh, this is Captain Pierce.
This is Captain Mclntyre.
- This is Lieutenant Harper, Judge Advocate General.
- Are you men doctors?
- Only when the moon is full.
- And will you sign and attest to that blood report?
- Oh, absolutely.
- Positively.
We're not only brilliant surgeons, we were once arrested for notarizing in public.
Same sad story, fellas.
The real G.I. Father left her.
She's not ostracized by her family.
Radar was kind enough to give her a lift one day, and instead of a thank-you note, she gave him the baby.
- Sir!
- Radar.
Sir, I thought it over, and I was lying before when I said the baby wasn't mine.
- It's hers, mine and ours.
- Radar.
No!
You guys wouldn't know me when I was in town.
I mean, I remember that night 'cause I took a shower.
I was wearin' my paratrooper scarf with nothing on underneath.
I had maybe two beers, and I was looking for trouble.
I wanted to get a tattoo, but the guy had printed "Mother" so much, he'd run out of ink.
I was taking the jeep back, saw her hitching a ride and stopped.
And, uh, I'd rather not say anything more in front of the baby.
Radar.
-  - Oh, Judas Priest, what now?
You're one.
You're two.
You're three.
Gimme that!
You're four.
You're five.
You're six.
- Frank, what's going on?
- They're being relocated in the south with some other lucky refugees.
- Anything else I can do?
- You can go with them.
- Just for six months.
- Yeah, till they get settled.
Oh, go jump in the lake!
Why, Radar?
Do you remember when she first came around and I said that I do, but I didn't?
Mm.
Well, I didn't because I don't, and I never.
But I sure liked the way it felt when everybody thought I did.
You will.
- You think?
- Oh.
Here you are, my children.
Just a little something to read on the trip.
If you have any questions, they've got branch offices all over.
Eh, she'll be okay, Radar.
She's got a family again.
All right, Dennis.
So long.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.
Bless you.
- Hi, Radar!
- You talking to me?
Who are you going to go to the movies with tonight?
- Wear the paratrooper scarf.
- Worked before.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
## ##  Hey, Radar.
Don't you know another song?
He doesn't even know that one.
Radar, you could be arrested for felonious fingering.
Attention, all personnel.
Since there are no casualties again today, tonight's midnight movie will be seen at 9:00 this morning.
Also, midnight will be canceled.
Ah, good morning, Colonel Blake.
Improving the outer man, I see.
Excuse me, Father.
You're blocking the sun.
Hmm?
Oh.
Oh.
Well, let there be light.
- I don't believe it.
-  Little to the left.
That's it.
Ah!
Steady as she goes.
Frank?
What's going on here?
- Everything all right at home, Frank?
- Can't talk now.
That ketchup bottle wants to be just a hair to starboard.
Ah!
All right.
Let me handle this.
I did a year at Bellevue.
What are you doing, Frank?
If you'll kneel at the end and get the tabletop at eye level, you'll see that each ketchup lines up as if there's only one bottle of ketchup.
Same is true of your condiments, which are arranged according to height and popularity.
There's your ketchup, your mustard, your relish, mayonnaise, oil and vinegar, salt and pepper and sweet and sour gherkins all in a row.
I think we should do something with Frank's head and mail it back to him.
In a jar.
Perfecto!
-  -  Father Mulcahy, are you in?
And open for business.
Ah, Klinger.
Very smart outfit.
- You busy, Father?
- Just washing my feet.
Parenthetically, did you know that it was the custom on Holy Thursday for the pope to wash a poor man's feet?
- So?
- Well, there's not much chance of His Holiness showing up here, so I thought I'd do my own.
But seriously, Klinger, what can I do for you?
Well, Father, it's so quiet around here, what do they need me for?
I'd like to get your opinion of this letter.
"Dear General Mitchell, Here's one more picture of myself "to prove I am mentally unbalanced and deservant of a psychological discharge.
You will notice that the dress I am wearing" - Oh, dear.
- "Is an exact copy "of the one Rita Hayworth wore in Gilda.
"At least it's close.
I only saw it once and I was sewing from memory.
"I'm a desperate man, General, and unless you give me the discharge, "I'll send the picture to your wife and say you've been seeing me on the side.
Yours truly, Corporal Klinger, MASH, 4077 th".
- What do you think, Father?
- Klinger, the Lord moves in mysterious ways, but you take the cake.
##    Hey, get me outta this!
- Is anybody there?
- Anybody where, Frank?
Get me out of here, you animals!
- Out of where, Frank?
-  I'm boxed in!
We all feel that way at times, Frank.
You guys will pay for this!
Take it easy, Frank.
The pilot says we'll be in Chicago in an hour.
Hey, guys, let's settle down, huh?
Folks, I'd really like to get started.
I'd really like to get Radar?
Quiet!
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Well, being as how we've got so much spare time on our hands lately, I thought I'd deliver the required commanding officer's monthly, uh, orientation lecture this morning, rather than wait for another time, which while we have it, why not use it, huh?
So, uh, if you guys are ready, why, we'll start with today's subject.
Which is what, Henry?
I'm going to answer questions later, Mclntyre.
Give us the subject first, in case we can't tell what it is from your talk.
Could you quiet up?
No, seriously, guys, this is a, uh, not an easy lecture to give, and I'd appreciate the, uh, fullest of your total attention on this.
- Uh, Radar?
- Yes, sir.
-  - There we go.
I think I'll check on my candle shipment.
- Simmer down.
Radar, do you want to - Yes, sir.
Well, here are our old friends Figure "A" and Figure "B".
Man, woman; mom, dad; boy, girl.
Maggie and Jiggs.
Now, uh, whether a person be an "A" or a "B," he or she is blessed with a -  - I mean Okay, after all, I, uh, I guess I don't have to tell you what you Figure B's are blessed with.
The human body, you know, can whether she be "A" or he be "B" can find itself with a certain kind of, um, medical trouble.
What kind of trouble is that, Henry?
I'll come to that later.
I may not be awake then.
Now, guys, uh, some of you are going back home to your wives.
Some of you are going back to your sweethearts.
And some, for all I know, are going back to both.
I've heard this guy.
He's great.
Irregardless of what you've got waiting, I mean, uh, you owe it to that waitee to return home with a clean mind and a clean body.
-  - Because, like I like to say, "Clean is as clean does and clean does as clean thinks".
Henry!
Figure "A"just fell asleep.
Mclntyre, we can do without the levity.
Will you stop "levitting"?
Well, uh, excuse me.
"Difficult, you ask"?
Of course.
Well, I can understand that question having just asked it myself.
Look, it is, uh, difficult, men.
Uh, um, I mean, really.
You're, uh It's Saturday night.
You got a 24-hour pass.
- You're 20,000 miles from home.
- You can't make it.
I tried.
You walk into a bar, and it's full of"B" girls.
Shh!
Now, you guys know what I'm talking about, men.
Resist.
You know what I mean?
Use your heads.
Use your common sense.
Come on now.
Quit giggling, guys.
I'm gonna level with you.
Shh!
You've got to fight temptation.
I mean, now look.
Okay.
Whatever you do, don't run the risk of catching today's subject.
Are there any questions at all?
- Radar?
- Sir, I just have one question.
- What is it?
- Do you suppose that someday you could give us a talk on V.D.?
- Hey!
Bravo!
- Hey!
Bravo!
Excuse me.
- You want that card?
- Uh, no.
Packages for you, sirs.
From the Peerless Costume Company, Philadelphia?
- Hey!
-  - That's it!
They got here!
- Yeah, terrific!
Hey, this will liven the joint up.
Thanks, Klinger.
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, I like it.
- I just made it.
- How do you do it on your salary?
- Hey.
- Ain't that beautiful?
Frank, you've got to do it sometime.
Why can't you face your hernia?
- I don't want to be operated on.
- Now is the perfect time.
The O.R.'s quiet, and they're not busy.
Before I'd let them operate, I'd wear an iron truss.
Fair is fair.
They're excellent surgeons.
Oh, they're all flash.
I mean, so they save their patients.
Neither one of them owns his own car.
Frank, they can relieve your pain.
Fat lot those two Bulgarians care about my pain.
Did I tell you about the boxing?
- They didn't hit you, Frank.
- No, they crated me in my sleep.
- No, you never told me.
- I don't tell you half their stunts.
- I mentioned the oatmeal in my gas mask?
- Yes, you did.
How about when they stapled a whole roll of my toilet paper?
Frank, they're beneath contempt.
They're not fit to shine your clusters.
And you're asking me to put myself into their hands?
Yes.
It's true they're incorrigible.
They're also two of the very best surgeons I've ever seen.
Oh?
Really?
Well, where do you stand on yours truly?
- Oh, Frank.
- No, let's have it out.
As professionals.
Nurse to doctor.
How do I rate with you as a surgeon?
Oh, Frank, don't you have enough pain?
Let's see.
You're holding tens.
- Take a card!
Pick a card!
- Don't rush me!
What was the knock card?
Frank, it's for your own good.
You need this operation.
Well, when they have me open, who knows what they'll stick in.
Oh, they wouldn't.
They're not inhuman.
Pierce?
Mclntyre?
- What is it, Frank?
- Take off those masks!
Take off those suits!
- We will if you will.
- Where did you get those costumes?
- What costumes?
- The costumes you're wearing.
These aren't costumes.
We stopped shaving last month.
- Margaret, how can I possibly?
- Be strong, Frank.
Go ahead.
I want to talk to you both as doctors.
What's the problem, Frank?
Well, I've had this condition that's needed attention for about ten years.
Why do people always wait so long before they go to their gorilla?
Will you be serious?
This man has a hernia.
Um, I would like to ask you if you'd, uh, consider operating on me.
One moment.
I'll have to check with my colleague.
We'll do it me and the missus.
- Margaret!
- I'll be here every moment.
If anything should happen, would you write my wife?
Are you out of your mind?
Evenin', chillun!
How y'all?
Oh, Lord!
Let's hear it now for that great star of stage, screen and surgery Dr. Benjamin Franklin Pierce, his dirty fingernails and his orchestra!
Thank you for that fine introduction.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And now, ladies and germs, with your very kind permission, we'd like to do a little operation we've had a lot of luck with.
We certainly hope it turns out to be one of yours.
You said you would be serious!
Oh, quite right.
Give the patient a local.
- Rusty needle, please.
- Oh!
Attention, all personnel.
Attention!
Incoming wounded!
Incoming wounded!
- Both shifts report to surgery.
- Well, the party's over.
- Back in business, damn it!
- Get up, Frank.
Well, what about my hernia?
Keep it for a few days.
If you like it, it's yours.
Suit up, Frank.
We're promoting you from patient to doctor.
You can do it.
Just cut along the dotted line.
Don't look.
He's an idiot, but he's really stacked.
All right.
Step right up, folks.
The war is back in town.
- Post and pre-op personnel stand by.
- All right.
Come on.
Ambulance drivers report to their stations immediately.
- Sponge.
-     Suture.
Well, they certainly didn't forget how to hurt each other.
Rib cutter.
- Rib cutter.
- Start another unit of whole blood.
This is gonna be a long one.
You doing okay?
All right.
Gimme a sponge.
- Move your pretty bottom, honey.
- Sorry, Doctor.
- Tie that off.
-  Attention.
Due to continuing heavy incoming casualties, the mess tent will remain open all night.
And that ends the 8:00 food warning.
Scalpel.
- You got a pretty good tan, Henry.
- Well, I'm paying for it now.
I hope this guy doesn't toss in his sleep.
Gimme another one.
Hold this.
Hold this.
Gimme another clamp.
Hurry up!
Let's go!
Fast!
We need some more sponges here.
- Frank, how do you feel?
- I'd be better without the chatter.
Is that nice?
After all the trouble I went through lining things up.
- Lining what things up?
- Lf you get down at the end of the room, you'll see the gallbladders are all in one line.
Then the livers, then colons all the organs arranged according to height and popularity.
Oh, can the malarkey!
Hey!
Did anyone remember to light up the Red Cross sign?
Hell's bells.
I just paid the bill.
- Try the three.
Hold that.
- Colonel?
- Yo!
- You busy?
Not at all.
I'm just telling this man's fortune by reading his bowels.
Supply sent me.
We're dangerously low on whole blood.
Aw, wouldn't that strip your gears?
For two weeks, we've been sitting around on our duffs.
While we could have been bleeding into bottles.
All right.
Watch the finger, will you, Mclntyre?
- I'm sorry.
- Organize some donors, Father.
- Get plenty of blood.
- You've just been promoted to vampire.
- Turn in your cross.
-  You got that?
- That is my finger!
- All right.
Uh, hello?
Yeah, 789th Artillery?
Yeah, this is 4077 th MASH.
Corporal O'Reilly.
Listen.
We're getting a lot of near misses here.
Can you find out who's doing it?
You're doing it?
Listen, buddy.
We're a hospital.
How would you like it if we fired patients at you?
What?
Those are your orders?
To knock the enamel off of 500 bedpans?
Who gave you those orders?
Wait a minute.
Hold on.
What?
That's it.
Go take this to the E.R.
This is very good of you all.
Don't get up too fast.
Have some orange juice.
- Oh, Klinger, how good of you.
- It's ridiculous.
A million miles from home, laying on a table like a centerpiece and somebody's siphoning me for blood.
Well, don't talk too much.
Donating can make you dizzy.
I know.
I brought along a pair of low heels.
Okay, remove that clamp.
We're in the homestretch now, honey.
-  -  - This neighborhood is going to hell.
-  Any minute now.
Okay, you close.
I've done the important part.
How'd everything go today, dear?
Kindly do not block the aisles!
Oh!
Ow!
- What is it?
- My hernia!
- Strangulated, Frank?
- I think so.
- Henry!
- I'm up to my wrists in guts.
- Trap?
- No, I can't.
I got an open chest here.
- Can you close?
- Yes, Doctor.
- Old chromic, right?
- Right.
- Frank, you sure?
- You gotta operate now!
- All the tables are taken.
- I don't need a table!
Do it anywhere!
- Do it on the floor!
- If we do, I'll have to clean it up.
- Somebody throw me a nurse.
-  Murphy!
- Gimme a hand, will you?
- What are you doing?
- We may not have to operate.
- Where are we going?
- The Mayo Clinic.
I know the headwaiter.
- Oh!
Regimental headquarters?
This is MASH 4077 th.
Major O'Reilly speaking.
We're getting a mess of artillery here.
I'm told you people ordered it.
I want it stopped right now, and that's an order!
What?
Uh, well, I'm 19.
Look, buddy, my C.O. Told me to call.
He's busy!
Well Try who?
All right.
Wait a minute.
Hold on.
You think this will work?
It's been known to happen, Frank.
The intestine might slip back into place.
All the blood's rushing to my head.
I can't understand the attraction.
Don't worry, Frank.
We'll fix you up.
You'll be walking all over people again in no time.
- Really?
-  - What was that?
- Nothing, Frank.
The folks down the block wanna kill us.
- Oh!
- It's for the pain, Frank.
Oh!
You have so much to do, and I'm a bother.
- Yes, Frank, you're a bother.
- I'm a pest and a nuisance.
Yes, Frank, you're a pest and a nuisance and a bother.
You're only saying that to make me feel good.
Right, Frank.
It was naughty of you to pack me in a crate.
I could have suffocated.
No chance.
We made airholes.
And we put lettuce in.
And a carrot.
And some shredded newspaper in case you had an accident.
Fred?
- Yes, Frank.
- Do you think the principal saw us?
Corporal.
- Let me see if I've got this right.
- Go ahead, Father.
- Forceps.
- Forceps.
You want a B.L.T. On wheat toast.
- Hold the mayo.
- Right.
And a chocolate shake.
All right, let's tie this vessel, then we'll start on the bladder.
- Right.
- Chocolate shake.
- Thick.
- You got it.
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go.
Trapper, can I take your order?
It's about time.
I've been trying to get a priest for half an hour.
Oh, this is not my table.
If my hands could talk, they'd scream.
- I'm raw from all this scrubbing.
- Why don't you see a doctor?
How'd you like a swift kiss in the mouth?
- How is he?
- He's fine.
But he may never move the piano again.
We got him on his head and sedated.
If it doesn't reduce itself, I'll have to operate.
- That's very decent of you, Pierce.
- Well, I owe it to him.
- Of course.
- After all, he gave me his place in the lifeboat when the Titanic went down.
I vowed I'd save his life one day, since he gave his up for mine.
Oh!
- How's Frank?
- He's on his head at a 45-degree angle, talking through his belly button.
- How's business?
- Jumping.
I'm taking a break.
Eh, shut up.
- Rough, huh?
- Plenty.
- Want a puff?
- Thanks.
- I'm taking ten minutes.
- I'm on ten minutes.
Between us, we got 20 minutes.
Let's go!
That's what I said, soldier, Lieutenant Colonel O'Reilly.
I wanna know where you people come off shelling so close to a hospital.
Would you repeat that, Sergeant?
Rizzo?
Tony?
Tony, this is Radar.
Listen.
What are you guys doing?
Change your fire, will you?
About 15 degrees west.
Come on, Tony.
Do it, huh?
And move your azimuths!
Metzenbaum scissors.
Sirs, got a minute?
- What is it, Klinger?
- A pregnancy problem, sir.
Klinger.
Klinger!
Who is he, Klinger?
He's got to marry you.
Come on.
There's a Korean lady out here.
We timed her.
She's in labor.
All right.
Get her on the last table.
Houlihan.
- I'll take care of it.
- Now we're delivering babies.
Hope it's not a boy.
They'll draft him.
All right, gangway.
Got a hot major here.
Put him on the second table there.
- What's his story?
- He's zonked out of his skull.
Hi, gang.
Shall we open our presents now?
He's prepped and ready.
You wanna do him?
I'm not scrubbed.
Yeah, okay.
George, you wanna you wanna take over for me?
- How you doing, Frank?
- Honest, Dad, the maid's a liar.
Terrific.
Kocher, please.
- Frank, are you all right?
- Yes, Mother.
-  Colonel Blake?
- Be right there.
-  -  Oh, what is this?
Go ahead.
It's all yours, George.
Take over.
Just sewed a towel to this guy's stomach.
- Put him under.
- He said he wanted to watch.
Well, then we'll invite him by later.
Go ahead.
Fill him up.
We're gonna have a baby here.
-  Well, I'm ready.
-  - What did I say?
- They got the generator.
-  I need light.
- All right.
All right.
Let's not panic until it's necessary.
I said west, Tony.
West.
You're doing just fine.
Take deep breaths.
-  Okay, next body.
-  That was your last body.
You're much too modest, kid.
-  -   Well, looky here.
- Margaret.
- You're all right, Frank.
- I am?
- You're fine.
It's all over.
-  - What's that?
You and Margaret are the parents of a five-pound baby hernia.
## Attention.
Attention, all personnel.
No casualties expected for indefinite period.
A.F.R.S.
Announces the release of Nazi war criminal Alfred Krupp.
Everybody's goin'home but us.
#You'll never know # #Just how much # # I miss you # #You'll never know # #Just how much I care ## - Two martinis, please.
- And don't spare the bananas.
You come here often, honey?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Attention!
Senior surgical staff and Father Mulcahy report to Colonel Blake's office.
On the double.
Shake it, sirs.
Will you be serving drinks, sir?
Radar, this is not a social function.
This is probably the most serious meeting I've ever had to call.
This will take all of my resources to guide us through these rocky waters.
This will be a real test of my "leadershipmanship".
So no booze.
- Colonel.
-  Morning, Father.
Take a pew.
- We're here, Colonel.
- Good.
Just park your heinie.
This better be important.
Major Burns is very busy.
- It's important.
- He certainly hopes so.
These senseless meetings have wasted enough of his time.
You're in very good voice today, Frank.
Be sure to wind him up for the question period.
- Hi, Henry.
Skull session?
- Where's Pierce?
He'll be along in a minute.
He's giving a nurse mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Ten-hut!
Oh, come on, Pierce.
Can the tomfoolery.
- Morning, Father.
- Good morning.
- Comfortable?
- Yes.
This your first flight?
All right, people.
I'm gonna give it to you straight.
Starting right here and now we're all going to have to put our shoulders to the wheel, our noses to the grindstone.
We've got to hunker down and pull together, all for one and one for all.
Welcome to the Henry Blake Cliche Festival.
I happen to be serious, Mclntyre.
- Then stop talking in samplers.
- Our supply line's been cut.
- Who did that?
- The other side, Frank.
We can't do everything ourselves.
Radar, read a list of a few of the things we won't be getting for a while.
Yes, sir.
"Fruit, vegetables, assorted food, "fuel oil, blankets, bandages, - linen replacements, toilet paper".
- Uh-oh.
That hurts.
"No mail call, no electrical parts, "no flares, no winter clothing, - no playing cards, no shuttlecocks".
- That does it.
How do they expect us to fight a war without shuttlecocks?
If they can fly wounded in here on choppers, why not supplies?
If Regimental's right, the fighting shifted to the north and we won't be getting any casualties.
That's the same Regimental that said to Custer, "One last stand, and then you can go home".
I think H.Q. Knows what it's doing, buster.
It's galling to hear officers ridicule command.
I'm not an officer.
Two guys from the draft board caught me with a big butterfly net.
There you go.
There's your lounge lizard at war.
That one I got to write down.
We've all had it too good too long.
What would have happened in 1776 if the Minutemen on their way to Concord had stopped to worry about toilet paper?
So we would have had independence ten minutes later.
All right, people, let's put a lid on the bickering.
We're all in this together.
I think this entire unit should go on immediate red alert.
That makes good sense.
I would make it conditional, however.
- On what?
- On what does red alert mean.
Emergency situation.
Drastic measures.
Distribution of power.
Watch it, Henry.
This is how they got the Czar.
- I know what to do, Pierce.
- Here you go, sir.
Radar, give me this here clipboard I got here.
All right, during this situation of, uh Red alert.
Red alert.
The following people will be in charge of these things that they'll that they'll be in charge of.
Uh, fruit, vegetables, assorted food - Major Frank Burns.
- Here, sir.
- He could've fooled me.
- Burns.
You'll be in charge of conservation, distribution and the possible rationing of food.
Captain Mclntyre, heat and electrical power.
Captain Pierce, maintenance and general service and supplies.
Major Houlihan, you will look after the nurses.
Margaret, I'll trade you my maintenance for your nurse looking-after.
- Down, Pierce.
- Okay.
Radar will be the housing officer.
Now, before this is over, we may have to double up or triple up to save heat.
Radar will decide who sleeps with who.
Radar, I'd like to see you right after the meeting.
- What's my assignment, Skipper?
- Oh, Father Mulcahy, of course.
Uh Ah, you'll be in charge of morale.
"L" for Isaiah, 26.
L-26.
"N" for Nazareth.
N-37.
Bingo!
I got it, Father!
- All right.
Let's review.
- What have you got there?
Bingo, sir.
"Nazareth" put me over.
Those are coffee beans.
We're facing a possible food shortage, and you're playing with people's beans.
Father, I'm surprised at you.
Really, Father.
Well, I only thought for morale purposes - Lay off the Father, Major.
- Will you stay out of this?
Where did you get that mink coat?
I paid for it myself.
"What did you do in the war, Daddy"?
"I was latrine officer, son.
My outfit never made a move without me".
Hey, should we leave in the staples?
Damn the staples, man.
This is war.
Everyone has to live dangerously.
- Hey, close the door.
- What are you Okay, guys, put 'em right in here.
What's going on?
New sleeping arrangements, by order of Corporal O'Reilly, housing officer.
Hey!
By order of Captain Mclntyre, heating officer.
- Radar.
- Sir?
I want to dictate an order.
Radar, uh, am I getting taller or is the room shrinking?
- Well, somebody cut the legs off, sir.
- Aw, that's dirty pool.
Well, they'll burn anything to keep warm, sir.
I know, but to cut off a man's legs and steal his drawers.
Okay, take an order.
- Uh, we're out of paper, sir.
- They burn that too?
Well, not right off.
Attention!
Due to shortage of oil and wood, tonight's movie will be burned at 1800 hours.
Where did you get that wood, soldier?
My sister sent it to me, sir.
Oh.
Come in, Frank!
Hi.
Is the lady of the house in?
- What are you selling?
- That depends.
What are you buying?
Oh, Frank.
You have the perfect personality in a crisis.
I've got something better than that.
- Oh, Frank, it's so cold.
- Wait.
- Frank, a baked ham!
- Shh!
Where did you get it?
As food supply officer, I was checking the supplies.
I requisitioned it on a chain of command priority basis.
- You swiped it.
- Right.
Oh, Frank, how can we eat when others may go hungry?
We're leaders, Margaret.
We need to be strong.
The others will be weak because they haven't eaten, but we'll be strong because we've got the food they didn't get.
Frank, when you say it, it makes so much sense.
You've eaten all the pineapple, Margaret.
Oh, Frank, I hate to admit it, but war can be exciting.
Oh, yes, when God is on your side.
- Who is it?
-  It's the heating officer.
- You can't come in!
-  We'll huff and we'll puff and we'll blow your nurse down.
-  - One Just one moment!
- That hot plate has to go.
- Who says so?
- He does.
He's in charge of heat.
- And just who are you?
I'm his helper.
He doesn't like to heat alone.
We're cutting down on electricity use, except for the hospital.
Has somebody been operating on a pig in here?
- What a dumbbell question.
- Trap, you smell it?
Unless I'm mistaken, we've interrupted a luau-ectomy.
Take the hot plate and get out.
- No!
No!
- Frank, let go of that.
- I got you covered.
- Hello, hello, hello.
What is it?
Mr. Minuteman here has climbed down off the Washington Monument long enough to do a little Valley Forge gorging.
I'm deeply ashamed.
Major Houlihan had nothing to do with it.
I alone perpetrated this awful act of greed.
Major, what happened here tonight will never leave this room.
What about the ham?
The ham will have to be put back from whence it came.
- Of course.
I'll do it.
- No, we'll do it.
- How do we know you won't gonna eat it?
- Give us a saliva test later.
Captain, Captain.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
You're both most gracious.
Say no more, ma'am.
Frank, we'll expect a hundred dollars every Tuesday.
Small bills, unmarked, in a plain envelope.
Oh, you.
We are not.
All personnel must begin sleeping together tonight.
Check bulletin board to determine the sex of your tent.
What's for dinner?
Brick again?
I gotta heat my cot.
When all this is over, I'm gonna invent an electric bedpan.
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, you scoff.
They laughed at Orville Wright when he invented his brother Wilbur.
They said he would never get him off the ground.
Oh!
Oh!
Guess I'm your bunk buddy for tonight.
Welcome aboard, Father.
This is quite a hotel you have here.
This is where the Ritz hit the fan.
- Well, where do I sleep?
- On anything that doesn't move.
And if you pray in your sleep, please try to mumble.
Of course.
Well, I guess I'll just brush my teeth now and hit the old sack.
Roger, Father.
Hi.
This is where I'm supposed to be tonight.
I'm not so sure.
You either need an escort or you have to wear a necktie.
Where do I park it?
- Do you like to read at night?
- Yeah.
Take the cot next to Frank.
He gives off a glow.
That one right there.
I never slept in an officer's tent before.
We'll try to be kind.
Chickee, the house dick.
What's the idea of the gun, Frank?
It's classic.
The enemy cuts off your supply lines lets you get cold and hungry, and then they go right for your soft underbelly.
- That's why the rifle, fella.
- Just like you to panic, Frank.
Who's panicking?
Well, do you see anybody else pressing the soft underbelly button?
- What's he doing in here?
- Sharing our tent.
Not on your nellie.
You won't catch me sleeping with an unlisted man.
- Frank?
- Hmm?
Just wrap yourself in the flag and go to sleep.
And don't get in bed with that gun.
That's an order.
A captain can't give a major an order.
- Then it's a threat.
- Well, that's different.
This was a great war till you guys showed up.
Oh!
Oh!
- Colonel Blake's party.
- We have your reservation, sir.
A single bed for yourself and a cradle for your son.
Let's not have a lot of tongue-wagging in here tonight.
Which bed should I take, sir?
Well, let me face away from everybody, Radar, on account of me snoring.
- Oh, lovely.
- Henry, you're joking.
Joking?
I could be on the Olympic Snoring team.
I snored the siding half off of my house.
I even got a fan letter once from the seismograph people at Fordham.
How are we supposed to sleep with that?
Well, if it gets too bad, just do what my wife does.
- What's that?
- Hold me close.
Oh, rats.
I have to go to the sandbox.
Ow!
Klinger.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Oh!
Oh!
- Hey, Power Boss.
- Yeah?
- Can we afford a little night music?
- Yeah, about 30 minutes.
- ## - What kind of cold cream is that?
- Creme de Menthe.
- My wife uses it.
- Oh?
- On her corns.
Oh, Frank, you're all romance, you devil.
Aw, shut your face!
Any of you sirs want anything before I do my nails?
Yeah.
What do you say we all observe about eight hours of silence?
Excuse me, Burns.
Better keep the brass monkeys in tonight.
Well, I guess we're all here.
Our Heavenly Father, we thank Thee for seeing us through this day and ask Thy divine help for tomorrow.
Same time, same station.
Sorry, Father.
That's quite all right.
Humor, too, is one of His creations.
It's been years.
Let me see if I can recall that prayer.
"Now I lay me down to sleep, a bag of peanuts at my feet.
"If I should die before I wake, give them to my brotherJake".
Attention, all personnel.
Incoming wounded.
Heavy casualties expected inside the hour.
All personnel on full alert.
They said there weren't going to be any more casualties.
Frank, if I were you, I'd sue North Korea for every penny they've got.
All right, everybody, up and at 'em.
We've got ourselves a new ball game.
All the food, all the fuel.
Patients get first priority.
Let's move.
I knew all this was too good to last.
Hello.
Regimental?
Yeah, hold on for Colonel Henry Blake.
Sir, Regimental!
Regimental?
Henry Blake here, MASH 4077 th.
Say, we're running out of just about anything you guys'd care to name.
Fuel, rations.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
And newspaper is selling for one dollar a page.
A dollar a page.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Stars and Stripes.
Anything we can get our hands on.
Right.
Look, buddy, what do you say you get on the stick down there, huh?
Yeah, l I realize Yes.
Now, wait Just lis Now, look, buddy, I bought a lot of war bonds, and you are now talking to a pretty upset stockholder.
- Pickups and scissors.
- Pickups.
Scissors.
-  Chisel.
-  Yes, Doctor.
For guys who weren't supposed to be wounded, they're doing a good imitation.
- Kelly clamp.
- Kelly.
Frank, you're magnificent under stress.
Thank you.
Attention, all surgical personnel.
Electrical power will be cut by ten percent.
And please use whole blood only when absolutely necessary.
- Try not to bleed, huh, fella?
- Can you believe that?
All they can send us is casualties.
Everything else they run out of.
Okay, clamp that artery.
It's bleeding against orders.
This place ought to be called Benedict Arnold Hospital.
Hey, Frank made a joke.
I think we ought to get a second opinion on that.
Sponge.
# Comrades, comrades # # Ever since we were boys # # Sharing each other's sorrows # # Sharing each other's joys ## "Uninhibited nurse interested in Nietzsche "Freud, Beethoven and pre-Columbian art will spend evening with anybody with five pieces of wood".
"Hungry?
Cold?
Tired of it all?
"Come to tent nine, change into something comfy, put on mask and wait.
No appointment necessary".
Sir, we're gonna have to set up in here tonight.
It's a smaller tent.
Less heat required.
I understand, Radar.
Uh, Radar, what's the poop on the overall situation, status-wise?
Not too bad, sir.
The food's holding out and the fuel's okay.
We are having a little trouble with the T-paper shortage.
Oh?
People are breaking into the fortune cookies.
And I really feel that we girls have held up our end of this critical situation in true-blue American fashion.
When this is over, I will personally send in a commendation for those of you who have acted in the Yankee Doodlest manner.
-  Good night, girls.
-  Good night, Major.
Good night, Major.
Klinger!
Out!
Frank, stop swinging.
Well, I can't help it.
What time does this tent land at Ellis Island?
Hey, can we put a lid on the chatter?
I'd like to get some shut-eye.
Hear!
Hear!
- Radar.
- Sir?
You wear boots to bed?
Well, just in case I have to, uh you know.
Oh, Radar, I wish you hadn't said that.
- Henry.
- Hmm?
- Not again.
- Mm-hmm.
I'd give five dollars if somebody would go to the latrine for me.
- I'd go.
- That'd be two-fifty, Henry.
No sense fighting it.
Henry, I think you're ready for your 3,000-mile check.
Ha ha.
Guys and sirs.
Hi.
Klinger, you promised to be home by 10:00.
Major Houlihan threw me out of the nurses' tent.
She found out I was a man.
You've got to get up pretty early in the morning to fool Major Houlihan.
Look out, folks.
Bring back a copy of tomorrow's New York Times.
- That's very funny, Mclntyre.
- Maybe there's a review of the war.
Just our luck it'll be a hit and we'll be here for five years.
Just go to sleep, will ya?
Radar, save my place.
Let's everybody go to sleep fast before he comes back.
Did you believe that snoring he did last night?
Speaking of noise, why don't you shut your yaps?
Martha, we're going to have to move.
The people upstairs are impossible.
Knock it off, you foul balls.
Now, fellows, this should be our finest hour.
- Father, your cross keeps sticking me.
- Oh.
Forgive me, son.
- Why aren't you sleeping with a blanket?
- None of your beeswax.
- Everybody is freezing.
- It's my metabolism.
I'm hyperthyroid.
Very low blood pressure.
Very low body temperature.
That comes from being dead for two years.
Hey, his feet are hot.
What are you doing with hot feet, Frank?
His socks are hot too.
- You keep your nose out of my socks.
- He's wired.
Look.
A battery.
They're hunting socks.
I got a bra like that.
Maybe I'll sleep in the nurses' tent.
What am I saying?
- Share some of that heat, Frank.
- Don't you dare unplug me!
What's going on?
Frank's tootsies are wired and he won't share them.
- His what?
- They're hunting socks, sir.
At this hour?
I'll get the Bingo cards set up for breakfast.
- Take off his socks!
- For crying out loud!
Father, it's cold out there.
Want my stole?
Oh, thank you, my son.
- We're desperate, Frank.
- Yeah, give us your socks.
- Put your feet in my pocket for an hour.
- Are you crazy?
Give me a toe, Frank.
Let me hug your ankle.
Hey, now, come on.
Let's not turn into animals.
Give me that back!
Those are my socks!
Those are my batteries!
Henry, did you call Regimental yet?
Yes, I called Regimental and they said they're doing their best.
There are people at the Alamo still waiting for supplies.
Oh, gripe, gripe, gripe.
#The boys are marching # Kocher.
- Major?
- Yes, Doctor?
You're dedicated to the sanctity of human life?
- Of course.
- Blow in my ear.
- What?
- I'm so cold my pilot's gone out.
- Three-0-chromic.
-  Three-0-chromic.
I don't know whether to close this patient or crawl inside him.
Sir?
I've got some great news.
Well, tell me what it is and then burn it.
- Regimental called.
- Collect, right?
No.
They sent us a ton of stuff, a whole truck full.
Oil, warm clothes, steaks, hot dogs, hamburgers, firewood.
- Everything we need.
-  Settle down, people.
That stuff will be out there waiting for us.
First things first.
Forceps.
Ha ha!
I told you the army would come through.
Right again, Frank.
My one regret is that I didn't live to see it.
Metzenbaum scissors.
Metz.
Uh-huh.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't get me wrong, Corporal.
I'm very grateful for all the supplies.
Yes.
I mean, you guys saved our lives.
You're welcome.
No, it's it's just my office.
My office?
Yeah.
Well, you see, during the recent crisis, people had this aversion to freezing, so they just burned anything that didn't move or salute.
I mean, I'm talking to you from deep inside a real big empty.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Attention all personnel.
Wounded arriving at helipad.
All hospital staff now on alert.
#I've got you under my skin # - #I've got you deep in the heart of me # -  # So deep in my heart you're really a part of me # # I've got you under my skin # - Clamp.
- Clamp.
- Suture.
- ## - Where's that sponge, nurse?
Let's get this lamp straightened out.
Vite, vite!
#This affair never will go so well # Okay, Pierce.
Anytime now.
# When darling, I know so well # - He gets a nickel deposit back on that.
- # I've got you # - # Under my skin # - You getting paid by the hour, Pierce?
If I close him up before you remove those other fragments, we're gonna invalidate his warranty permanently.
- How's it going?
- On the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
#That comes in the night # Another subcu suture.
Come on, honey.
I'm on a hot streak.
- #And repeats and repeats in my ear # - Will you shut up?
# Don't you know, little fool you never can win # - Everything okay, Trapper?
- Just fine, Father.
Keep your fingers crossed.
# Use your mentality Wake up to reality # Having trouble tying the vessel off?
I thought you finished that chapter last night.
- Uh-oh.
- Want some more butter for your fingers, Frank?
Relax.
I'll retract the nerve.
You suture the muscle.
- Thanks.
- Can you see all right?
Fine.
Very kind of you to help, Pierce.
Maybe we can go into partnership after the war.
I'll handle the surgery, and you do whatever it is you do.
# Under my skin ## -  - I hate sunrise.
And those damn birds'll start singing in a minute.
Who are they to remind us of happiness?
You go back on again in an hour.
-  Amazing.
-  The sunrise?
The O.R. The amount of punishment the human body can take and still survive.
- The doctors or the patients?
- Which are we?
Hey, Radar, if you get me another cup of coffee, I'll kiss every bit of fat in your head.
- Sir?
- Yeah, I'll take another cup.
- Lieutenant?
- Yes, please.
- I'll write you a prescription.
That kid Frank and I operated on really took a beating.
Probably had something to do with the Korean War.
There's a lot of it here.
Not with those bruises.
You don't get bruises like that in combat.
- Looked like somebody used him for batting practice.
- We're all out.
I've gotta get back to pre-op.
I got a patient double-parked.
- Can I see you to your tent?
- No, thanks.
- Can I see you to my tent?
A neutral tent?
- Uh-uh.
I keep a little tent on the edge of town.
I can call ahead and have my man delouse it.
Good thing I thrive on rejection.
Cute.
This wins you a ride home, you know.
- You oughta see the smile under here, Doc.
- His hemoglobin is 12.6.
- That's up from last night.
- Continue penicillin and make sure he doesn't reenlist.
- Frank.
- Hmm?
- Frank, you scheduled Ross for active duty?
- Yes, sir.
Tomorrow, he'll have his cast off, and we'll have him out of traction.
I'm giving him a little rubber ball to squeeze.
Frank, who's it gonna hurt if he spends one week in Tokyo?
I mean, you know, he could take his little rubber ball with him.
May I remind you, sir, we're fighting a war?
Well, that certainly explains all the noise at night.
- This hospital is a vital cog in our fighting machine.
- Frank The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
That's why we can't allow any letdown in command or in the ranks.
Frank, you are the only man I know makes George Washington seem like a slacker.
- What's wrong, Frank?
This man miss morning calisthenics?
- Keep your two cents out of this.
Everything's under control.
We're having a consultation about medical needs.
Well, it's obvious.
Put him in a backpack and send him on a ten-mile crawl.
Burns, I'm ordering the private to be transferred to Tokyo for two weeks of R & R. Well, I guess that puts me in my place.
Hey, Henry, if you start acting humane, you'll take the fun out of the war.
Why, he really fries my butt.
Ross, have a ball.
Wounded three times?
You're quite a soldier, soldier.
- It's no trick getting hurt in a war.
- You're too modest.
It's a privilege.
I wish I were there to help all you wonderful guys fight the pink stain.
- Sir?
- The major means Communism.
- It really makes me see red.
- Yes, sir.
So we mustn't waste our strength fighting amongst ourselves, must we?
- I don't get you, sir.
- Your bruises.
You've been brawling.
- I'd have you reprimanded if you weren't such a good soldier.
- It's a free country, Frank.
- He's entitled to all the bruises he wants.
- Pierce, why is it we always turn up in the same place?
It only happens when I go tourist.
- You're very good at this.
- I majored in tickling at medical school.
Oh, that's heaven.
- I'm glad you're not married.
- Who says I'm not?
- Well, I don't see a ring on any of your toes.
-  Oh, I should return the favor.
I like mine through the boot.
Mind if I watch?
If it'll help.
You're doing a real good job.
- I'll do your toes if you like, Radar.
- Oh, no.
Thanks.
'Course, I charge extra for 12.
- All done, my dear.
-  If they're free, I'd like to take your toes out to dinner.
- I've got a date with Trapper.
- Oh, really?
Oh, well, I guess he must be all better then.
- Better?
- Oh, never mind.
- Doc, you got a minute?
- Anything wrong?
I feel fine.
Matter of fact, I was wondering when I could get out, get back to my outfit.
You want out after the army went to the trouble of arranging all this mud and lice?
You haven't even had dysentery yet.
It's all included in the same price.
- No kidding, Doc.
How soon?
- What's your rush?
The war'll still be there.
- Its option's been picked up.
- But there's no question that I will be back?
We're running some tests.
We'll know in a day or two.
Even if the tests come back against me, could you still okay me for combat?
You wanna go back?
Keep talkin' like that, I'll give you a saliva test.
Listen, Doc.
I've watched you around the hospital.
- You care about people.
- Some of my best friends are people.
- You noticed my bruises, huh?
- Very nice.
- Who's your exterior decorator?
- Well, Doc, two guys got beat up in my outfit: One colored and one homosexual.
So you're a Negro?
Who'd have guessed?
We went out last week and got drunk on leave, and I talked more than I should have about something that happened a couple years ago.
And you wanna go back to that outfit?
You're gonna get your Purple Heart all black and blue.
It's important to me that I finish my tour of duty, now more than ever.
Heads!
Excuse me, Hawkeye.
- How's it goin', Father?
- Protestants, seven, Catholics, three.
- But we'll get 'em.
- Go out for a long one.
-  - You won't say anything about our talk?
Only if you don't say anything about that throw.
-  Your move, killer.
- Nice flanking attack.
Can you get tennis elbow from checkers?
Your follow-through's all wrong.
How's this?
Remember that patient in surgery this morning?
Have to do better than that.
I stitched up enough soldiers this morning - to make a rug.
-   Am I winning or losing?
You're winning, but, uh, then it's two against one.
Which patient?
Crown me.
Weston.
The one with contusions.
- His buddies did it to him.
- What are buddies for?
They hung a homosexual label on him, and each one gave him a knuckle sandwich.
Nice.
Kid's got a lot of guts, wants to go back to the line.
He, uh One was bigger than the other.
What's more, Hitler wouldn't ride in elevators, constantly washed his hands.
Whenever he went to the bathroom or conquered a country.
Know what they also say?
I know that old trick.
When you talk about Hitler, you're really talking about me.
Au contraire.
When we talk about you, we're really talking about Hitler.
- Whose move is it?
- Doesn't matter.
The board keeps moving.
Trust you two to pervert something as fine and wholesome as checkers.
- We already whitewashed the fence, Aunt Polly.
- Ha-ha.
Well, while you two smart alecks have been lollygagging around, I came across something about a certain person that's very, very interesting.
Your serve.
"Very interesting," Frank?
- Very, very.
- Let us guess.
Is this person a well-stacked U.S. Army major nurse who's bigger than the bread box you're seeing on the side?
No.
No!
Then I give up.
There's one of those in camp.
- "One of those," Frank?
- Which one of those "thoses" do you mean, Frank?
One of those types that don't like girls.
Get it?
Ohh, one of those those.
Private Weston.
Patient came in this morning knows some of the guys in his outfit.
I think it's disgusting.
- What business is it of yours, Frank?
- Yeah, you're a surgeon.
- I'm also an American.
- All right.
You're an American surgeon.
Go operate on the flag.
Your move.
- How 'bout to another tent?
- Don't you understand?
The man is not normal.
- What's normal, Frank?
- Normal is everybody doing the same thing.
- What about individuality?
- Individuality's fine, as long as we all do it together.
Relax, Frank.
He'll be gone in a couple of days.
What do you mean, "relax"?
Don't you object to anything?
We have you, Frank.
We don't need anything else.
Care for a glass of checkers?
That soldier that powder puff is just the kind of weakness the enemy can exploit.
He's been wounded in combat four times, Frank.
Well, even a powder puff can get lucky sometimes.
- Think he might make waves?
- Mrs. Burns, I'm Dr. Pierce.
I'm afraid your son is suffering from terminal righteousness.
Attention.
All personnel are invited to the weenie roast following today's training film on trench foot.
- Good afternoon, Major.
- Good afternoon.
I see you chose the chops for lunch.
I'd rather have your fuzzy little neck.
Oh, yes, he prepares them beautifully.
- Frank, about what we were talking about.
- The subject is closed, Captain.
- As I was saying, Major - Frank.
- I was talking to the major, Captain.
- You talk to the captain.
- I'll talk to the major, Major.
- Sir?
- You keep out of this!
- Huh?
How can you kick this little puppy of a person?
Major Burns, I changed your patient roster like you told me to, sir.
- Um, thank you, Corporal.
Bring it by my tent later.
- Frank!
I have it here right now.
I haven't seen her move so fast since we put that pancreas under her pillow.
Why wasn't I informed?
I am head nurse.
- Give me that.
- You've taken Private Weston off your day sheet.
He said it gave him the willies to be around him.
You are an enlisted man, Corporal.
This is an officers' mess.
- Do you read me?
- If it'll help, I'll make him an officer.
- Gee, would ya?
- Dismissed!
- Yes, sir.
- Frank, I don't understand.
- Private Weston is sick, diseased.
Well, if he should be quarantined, I must know immediately.
What should be quarantined is Frank's mind, if we can find something small enough to put it in.
Margaret, trust me.
Perversion is one of the things we're fighting against.
You mean Private Weston, that nice boy?
That's what I understand from some very reliable gossip.
Frank had the duty roster changed because his pulse did the cha-cha every time he went near him.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That means lay off before you do some real damage.
- I don't have to take this kind of abuse!
- Oh, yes, you do, Frank.
You invite abuse.
It would be impolite not to accept it.
Frank, straighten out before we string you up by your stethoscope.
You get this straight: Weston is through.
When Division gets the letter I'm writing, he'll get the dishonorable discharge he deserves.
Major?
-  Cough.
-  - Cough.
-  - How do I sound?
- Uh, get some rest, cut down on booze and stay away from women for a while, sir.
- These monthly checkups are a pain.
- Yes, sir.
- Colonel, may I have a word with you?
- Don't you always?
It's been brought to my attention that we have an undesirable in the post-op.
I suggest immediate isolation and recommend a dishonorable discharge.
Very good, sir, especially with your eyesight.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about one of the patients.
Okay.
Now open wide.
He's not one of us.
He's one of them.
Who are them, Frank, that's not one of us?
- He's not a man.
- A woman?
There's no woman in post-op.
You know that.
Sir, a non-heterosexual.
Frank, why are you Frank, why are you telling me this?
Has the man made a pass at you, at me, at anyone?
- Give me your hand, sir.
- Yeah.
It was my duty.
As an officer, I'm obliged to report any man who may jeopardize his unit.
Well, you just never know, do you?
- Look here, sir.
- I'll need the necessary forms with your signature.
- Forget it, Frank.
- Colonel, don't make me go over your head again.
- Wow.
- What is it?
- I I'm not sure.
- How's it look?
I can't describe it.
It's like a little nativity scene.
What?
I'm a beat person.
One disadvantage of being sober is knowing exactly how you feel.
- Trapper, Hawkeye.
- Father.
Hope you haven't used all the holy water, Father.
No, no, no, no.
- My folks suggested I become a priest.
- Yeah, yeah?
- I like my Sundays free.
- Top of the mornin' to ya, you two-fisted, heart-of-gold, toora-loora-looral Father Mclntyre.
- Could you become a priest, remain celibate?
- If they'd had me quick-frozen.
- Pass the soap.
- Certainly, my son.
- Sirs?
-  - Close the door, Radar.
- Some of us are out of uniform.
Uh, can I see you both?
- If you stand on a box, you can.
- No, no.
This is serious, like.
- Well, tell us.
- Like.
Well, um, Major Burns is giving Colonel Blake a lot of static.
Major Burns is loaded with static.
He was born in a taxi with the radio on while it was stalled under a bridge.
- What's his beef, Radar?
- He's trying to force Colonel Blake to sign some forms so Private Weston will get a dishonorable discharge.
- How's he tried to force him?
- By insisting.
Since when is insisting forcing?
I honestly believe Henry Blake could be held up through the mail.
My towel, Tinker Bell.
- Here we go.
- Okeydokey.
- Clear polish or high buff?
-  - Huh?
- Buff, please.
- You have beautiful hands.
- Thank you.
They're my mother's.
If she ever finds out I've got them, she'll kill me.
Ohh.
Oh, my ear's been acting up all day.
Radar gave me a thorough checkup.
I was all right except that I got this, uh uh Did I, uh - Look, let's skip the manicure.
- Voila.
El finko himself.
- That was a dirty trick, Pierce.
- Thanks a lot, Henry.
- For what?
- For signing those forms for Frank.
- For helping to ruin another man's life.
- Can I say one thing?
- For once again winning the "Rubber Backbone Award".
- Pierce, I didn't sign.
How dare you do the right thing?
Frank said he'd go over my head.
I said, "Go".
He's done it so many times, I got footprints on my scalp.
- Frank.
- Natch.
Frank writes to Washington more than he does his wife, the big snitch.
Honey, check this ear, will ya?
What's it look like in there?
##   -  - Who is it?
Me.
- Frank, you want a bite?
- I don't feel like that, Margaret.
Can I type in here?
I've got to get away from those animals.
- Don't feel like what, Frank?
- Hmm?
Ohh.
- Any sign?
- Frank's still in there.
I'll never understand what they see in each other.
Fortunately, they don't see it in anybody else.
Hold it.
Her flaps are rustling.
- They're coming in for a landing.
- Her door's opening.
Frank is leaving.
His beady little eyes shift.
They look right, now left, now out the back of his head.
Now he gives Hot Lips a noncommittal good-bye leer.
And there will now be a short pause while he skulks casually back to the swamp.
And now, to work.
- That's it!
- You'd move out on account of a simple disagreement?
Simple?
You have a degree in simple!
When you told me you were 6'3", I didn't know that was your I.Q. - Oh, a character assassination just because we don't agree!
- What's wrong?
- Keep out of this, Frank.
- Can I help?
- Here's a hand mirror.
Do a lobotomy.
-  Lay off Frank.
You're just sore because he's right.
Here's a copy of War and Peace.
That oughta keep your lips moving for a year.
Wait a minute!
Did you say I was right about something?
- Never mind.
- No, no.
I have a right to know if I was right.
I'm not right that often around here.
If I know what it is, maybe I can do it again.
Why don't you find yourself a drugstore, Frank, and get weighed?
- What's eating him?
- He's P.O.'d because I happen to agree with you about Weston.
- You didn't this morning.
- Intelligence allows for a change.
I definitely think you should send in that report.
You guys are a pain.
You go together like salt and peter.
- Let him rave.
- You know, Trap, I've always felt you and I had the basis for a friendship, Trap.
As my last official favor, I'm gonna wait until I get outside before I throw up.
It's too late to apologize.
You guys, condemning somebody for something that's his own business.
Look me in the eye, TrapperJohn McHypocrite, and tell me there isn't something in your past you wouldn't like to keep buried.
And you, Dr. Clean Starched Underwear Next time you're browsing in the Bible, try to find a few words about compassion, if you can get past the part that says, "Thou shalt not admit adultery".
Little selective amnesia, Trap?
Remember that 80-proof confession about your first-year medical exams?
Medical exams?
- I had bought the answers.
Paid a hundred dollars for 'em.
- Wow.
- Suppose that ever got out.
Where would our hero be then?
- A hundred dollars?
- I was a kid.
- I paid 400 for mine.
And you have the dumb nerve to judge someone else?
- If you repeat that, I'll deny it.
- He won't tell anyone.
-  - What if I did?
Think you could handle a dishonorable discharge from the medical profession?
Could you give up your family and your vine-covered house, or is that your house and your vine-covered family?
Could you give up your office, with your leather couch and the receptionist?
That happened years ago.
I was a kid, like him.
I lied.
I was never a kid.
Most people wouldn't care about the "when," Frank, only the "what".
- Frank?
- Hmm?
People who live in glass tents?
Oh, tear it up.
- Don't take it so hard, Frank.
It's the right thing.
- It's galling.
You tear some.
It'll make you feel better.
You want me to help?
Phew.
Hey, you laid it on me pretty good, rotten-wise.
"Low I.Q." - Your lips move plenty.
- Only when there's a girl attached.
What you got in your past you'd like buried?
I've led a peerless life of exemplary behavior.
- There's a lot of sainthood talk going around in my town.
- You gonna start lying to me?
Lying?
I don't have to take that kind of talk from a man who started his academic career by failing the afternoon nap.
- Would you like a drink before you go?
- I thought you'd never ask.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
- Here you are, Radar.
-  Hey, mail call!
Oh!
Ohh!
Oh, come on, guys.
Radar.
Come on, Radar.
Come on, guys.
Come on.
Hey, hey, hey, a bonus!
My two girls, Hawk: Kathy and Becky.
"Dear Daddy: We hope you like these cookies.
- We made them ourselves.
Nobody helped us".
- I wish somebody had.
Wow.
I can't believe it.
How they've changed.
They must be a head taller, and where have I been?
You won a free trip to Korea.
All the slop you can eat and this suite at the WaldorfToilet.
From my sister and her ten dancing fingers.
For the man who has everything: A sweater with a guest room.
- Mail call, sir.
- Oh, good-o.
"Regimental headquarters.
For your eyes only.
Top secret".
- Is it?
- I didn't think so.
"On your next leave in Tokyo, remember Madam Wank's Casa de Massage.
Special prices on back walking this month".
- Back walking, sir?
- Yeah.
This girl takes her sandals off and walks on your bare back.
Ohh.
Hey, this is from my wife.
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Oh, boy.
I hope it's a cake.
Lorraine makes a sour cream and chocolate job that you could take intravenously.
She stirs in the sour cream with the melted chocolate.
The topping is about two inches of frosting, and that cake is as light as air.
With their bare feet?
She's kidding!
Check stubs, bank checks, canceled checks.
Twenty thousand miles from home, and she wants me to balance her checkbook.
Here's a vet bill.
Two hundred and thirty-six dollars for treating a fifteen-year-old cat.
- What'd she do?
Give it a face-lift?
- Wow.
Look at those beauties.
I guess I'm boring when I talk about my kids, huh?
No, as a matter of fact, that's the only time you're not boring.
I knew you'd understand.
I knew you'd understand.
- Hi, Frank.
- Hello, Frank.
That'll be the day.
- Had a letter from the little woman, Frank?
- More important than that.
From my stockbrokers.
Henderson, Landers and Flynn.
- I bet they'd fit in my sweater.
- "Dear Major"  "inform you"  -  - He got a letter written in "mumble".
- Hot-diggity-dog!
- They're sending him his Captain Midnight ring.
You're looking at a man who is $2,000 richer than he was a month ago.
What happened, Frank?
Did you die and leave yourself a lot of money?
Unlike some people, I don't waste my time drinking and chasing women.
We're thinking of chasing only drinking women.
Eliminates one process.
Quiet, will ya?
The man is trying to be dull.
Go ahead, Frank.
Dull away.
All I wanted to say is that my stock portfolio has about doubled since the war started.
Which war, Frank?
I've been in two.
I just can't get enough.
I'm talking about the Korean Conflict, smarty.
If you had any brains, you'd know war always increases stock prices.
- He's right, you know.
- Yeah?
Then what happened to my 10,000 shares of Gestapo?
Ohh, I can't talk to you guys.
- Promise?
- You're so dedicated, so noble.
- Wouldn't dirty your hands with money.
- Are you "serial," Frank?
I come from a long line of money-grubbers.
My great-grandfather, Tombstone Pierce, made his fortune selling whiskey and hors d'oeuvres to the Indians.
Whiskey and hors d'oeuvres, Gracie?
- He always said, "What's a drink without a nosh"?
- Aww.
Well, Franks Burns is gonna look out after number one.
- I'm not gonna be surgeon forever.
- Or for that matter, ever.
Oh, go soak your head.
- I wish somebody would tear him down and put up a human being.
- He's not worth the trouble.
No, no.
I think he is.
Matter of fact, I think he's ready for a little humility therapy.
If you will notice, I take pen and ink in hand, and soon, gentle reader, Frank will discover a letter which may well change the course of his mean little life.
- How can you be sure he'll find it?
- Quite simple.
I'll hide it.
-  - Who is it?
Major Burns.
It's about that exploratory we mentioned earlier?
Just a minute, Major Burns.
Come in, Major Burns.
Margaret, I wanna talk to you.
- Talk to me, Frank.
- I got a letter from home today.
I got something in mail call today too.
Oh, Margaret, your toe straighteners came.
Frank, sometimes you can be such a stupe.
Frank, sometimes you can be such a stupe.
I sent away for these sheer hose and these spike heels just to make myself more attractive to you.
You didn't have to do that.
I'd find you attractive if you were naked.
Thanks a whole bunch, Frank.
- What's your news?
- My investments are beginning to pay off.
Before long, my ship'll be coming into Easy Street.
- Mrs. Frank Burns.
- Where?
- I was just trying it on for size.
- Beg your pardon?
You always said, Frank, if ever you were rich enough, you would think about getting a divorce.
Now, hold it.
Just a minute, fella.
Nobody said I was rich.
I said I was doing well.
- What's the difference between rich and well, Frank?
- Well, "well" is okay, but to be rich, you've got to be a lot "weller" than only "well," no matter how swell "well" is.
Frank, you're double-talking.
I can always tell.
Your upper lip disappears.
Margaret, I swear to you, I'm not rich enough to afford a wife and an ex-wife.
That's a pity, Frank.
You see, these shoes also come in clear plastic, and you can see what each little toe is up to.
- Really, Margaret?
- Really.
Just think, Frank.
When the war is over, you can go back to your wife and her sensible shoes.
-  - I'll get rich, I promise you.
I will, the first chance I get.
- Sir, Corporal Klinger wants to see you.
- Oh, no.
Not Klinger.
- Not today.
- I think you should see him, sir.
He's got a new dress.
Well, if he's fussed, okay.
Klinger?
Sir.
Klinger Klinger - Is that it?
- Yes, sir.
Uh, Klinger, the rifle makes me nervous.
Actually, the purse does too.
Just sit down.
Take a load off your heels.
What's your problem?
Which I may have tattooed on my forehead.
- I got this in mail call today, sir.
- What is it?
It's a letter from my mother.
- "Dear Son" - You obviously haven't sent her a recent picture.
"I hate to bother you in the middle of a war, but I have some terrible news.
"Your father is very sick.
"If he knew I was writing to you, he'd be very angry.
Fortunately for us, he's in a coma".
- Klinger - Sir, please.
"We know your colonel has a good heart, and surely he'll let you "come home for your father's funeral or his 65th birthday, "whichever comes first.
"I will close this letter now, son of my heart, because my tears "are making the paper soggy and hard to write on.
Your loving, aggravated, brokenhearted mother".
Uh-huh.
Here you go.
The father dying, right?
Yes, sir.
Father dying last year.
Mother dying last year.
Mother and father dying.
Mother, father and older sister dying.
Mother dying and older sister pregnant.
Older sister dying and mother pregnant.
Younger sister pregnant and older sister dying.
Here's an oldie, but a goodie.
Half of the family dying, other half pregnant.
Klinger, aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Yes, sir.
I don't deserve to be in the army.
Dear Dad: Thank Sis for the sweater she made me.
It's almost as nice as the socks she knitted, one of which I use as a sleeping bag.
On to more important things.
Senator Magid's stock tip about Pioneer Aviation sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime.
When Pioneer announces its new defense department contract, a small investment could grow into millions.
Please sell all my assets and buy all the Pioneer stock you can.
At two dollars a share, it's a steal, especially as Senator Magid says it's sure to go as high as  - Corporal?
- Sir?
I want to make a stateside call.
It's a New York number.
Canal 7-9000.
Yes, sir.
I'll get on it first thing tomorrow morning.
I don't want it first thing in the morning.
I want it first thing now.
Uh, well, I can't get reach them now, sir.
I'll be calling them yesterday.
- That's ridiculous!
- Oh, no, sir.
They're 16 hours behind us.
Our today is their yesterday.
- It's 5:00 in the afternoon!
- That's here, sir.
Back there, it's 1:00 yesterday morning.
Everyone's gone to bed and said, "See you tomorrow," which by the time their tomorrow comes, will be our yesterday.
- Isn't it 16 hours later there?
- No, sir.
What if it is?
When would it be "now" there if it was our today here?
You see, we don't have the same "now," sir.
By the time their "now" becomes our "now," this'll be then.
Okay.
I think I got a bead on it.
In order for me to talk to them at 9:00 in the morning their time, what time does it have to be our "when"?
get you 9:00 their today there, sir.
- Then that's what we'll do.
- Sir, soon as I get a circuit.
There's a two-day wait.
I can't wait two days!
That'll be three days ago!
Right.
Um, can you send a cable?
- Shoot, sir.
-  It's to Henderson, Landers and Flynn.
Prescott Building.
Wall Street, New York.
- Okay.
- Sell immediately entire portfolio at market, regardless of cost.
Use proceeds.
Buy immediately all shares possible of Pioneer Aviation.
- Pioneer Avi - Shh!
- And sign that "Major Frank Burns".
- Yes, sir.
- And not a peep out of you about this, Radar.
- Oh, yes, sir.
Here.
This is for you.
- Thank you, sir.
- You got 50 cents change?
- No, sir.
- I'll give it to you later.
##  - Trapper, don't you think that's quite enough?
- Just one more chorus, Father.
- ##  - Is something troubling you, my son?
- I'm not Catholic, Father.
- Well, all in good time, which is more than we can say for your piano playing.
- ##  - Twenty thousand miles from home.
Not to have them around.
Not to share their growing up.
Just wait, Father.
Wait till you have children.
Well, l - I'm sure it'll all work out.
- ##   - Hawkeye?
- Huh?
- You got a second?
- Yeah, for you, anytime.
- I need help with something that came in the mail call.
- Oh?
Yeah.
Uh, I wrote this letter to this girl, and she wrote right back.
Sounds serious, Radar.
I saw this ad in the Captain Marvel annual for pen pals.
I sent in a quarter, and they sent me the name and address of someone to write to.
Oh?
Who is this two-bit friend of yours?
- MaryJo Carpenter from Port Salut, Montana.
- Very nice, Radar.
- A girl, right?
- Oh, she's terrific.
Uh, listen.
"Dear Captain O'Reilly: "Your first letter plus snapshot arrived this morning.
"I really got lucky.
Six foot two, smooth black hair, "terrific looker and a surgeon, to boot.
Boy, did I get my quarter's worth".
Six foot two?
- Black hair?
- I got it out of your files.
Radar, why?
Because I got brown hair, and I'm 2'6".
What's gonna happen if you ever run into this this letter person?
I won't.
- "Now that we've exchanged" - Wait.
How are you gonna explain the difference in your looks?
Uh Well, I'll tell her I got hurt in the war.
- Or I stepped on a mine.
- With your face?
Look, we're just pen pals.
Will you Will you listen?
-  -  "Now that we've exchanged pictures and general info, "I wish you would write me and let me know how you feel about things "and life, et cetera, et cetera.
"I feel very strongly about feelings.
"As soon as I get your feelings, I will send you mine.
- MaryJo Carpenter".
- Then what's the problem?
- Well, what are my feelings?
- How should I know?
Well, wait No.
You gotta know.
I mean, she wants to know my feelings, and they've gotta sound like the kind that come out of the face I sent her the picture of.
Radar, you can't send her my feelings.
You have to send her yours.
But I don't know what my feelings are.
Nobody ever asked me my feelings before.
- You've got 'em, Radar.
Everybody does.
- I have?
Of course.
Can you give me a hint?
Are you in, sir?
No.
No, Klinger.
This is a film of me.
I died about a hundred dollars ago.
Sir, I'd like to talk to you about something.
- You wanna reenlist, right?
- Sir, I have to confess.
I'm a Communist, an atheistic, Marxist, card-carrying, uh - Bolshevik.
- No, honest.
- You are not.
- I am too, you imperialist dog.
Klinger, I've never hit a woman before.
Sir, what do I have to do to get out?
That's your problem, Klinger.
I've got a desk full of my own.
Out!
Just think of it, Margaret!
It could be a fortune, maybe even a million!
- A mmm-mmm-mmm million!
- Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm!
Oh, Frank, say "a million" again and then kiss me quick.
- Mmm-mmm million!
- Mmm-mmm!
Oh, Margaret, you will have everything.
I'll cover you with furs, perfume, earrings.
I'll buy you French handmade bloomers!
-  Oh, Frank!
- I'm with you!
- Let's write her right now!
- Who?
- Your wife!
We can't write her now!
We'd wake her up!
- What?
- It's 16 hours earlier there.
If I write her today, I'll ruin her whole yesterday.
Frank, a millionaire can afford a wife and an ex-wife.
Don't you realize?
If there's a divorce, she gets half of everything.
Frank, your lip is disappearing again.
Margaret, I've thought of everything.
You can have your own apartment, and we'll make it close to my office for lunchtimes.
I'll pay the rent and let's say, uh, a hundred dollars a month for an allowance.
I get 400 a month now as a major.
Margaret, I can't bid against the United States Army.
I mean, you'll have your own room and board and $25 a week clear.
- Now, if you would invest that in a Christmas club - Get out, Frank.
Out?
- You and your Pioneer Aviation.
- Shh!
No one's supposed to know.
Pioneer Aviation!
Pioneer Aviation!
Pioneer Aviation!
"Dear MaryJo: Received your letter and read same.
"You asked me what my feelings are, and I believe what follows are those.
"Two things are number one with me.
"Being kind to everyone regardless of race, creed or sex, "if you'll excuse that four-letter word.
"And also being honest.
Speaking of which, "I have to tell you, I'm really not a captain only a corporal.
"And I am not a doctor, although I was once a patient.
"Am enclosing a more recent picture of me, which will give you a better idea "of the color of my hair and real length.
"I'll watch for your feelings by return mail.
Your pen pal, Radar O'Reilly".
It any good?
I dub thee 6'2".
Uh, was it something I said?
I'm gonna grab a jeep, drive to Seoul and catch the first plane home.
Right after they shoot you for desertion, you'll get a ticket for drunk driving.
You got eight rolls of toilet paper in there.
I don't wanna go home empty-handed.
I gotta see my daughters.
Do you know how long it's been since I made love to my wife?
At least one daughter ago.
Trap, leaving a war in the middle is very upsetting to those who invited us.
Listen.
I don't like a movie, I get up and leave.
I don't like the war.
I'm goin'.
Aw, come on, Trap.
You gotta stick around and see how it ends.
Oh, but it doesn't end.
It's continuous.
When it finishes here, they take it on the road.
I can catch it anytime, anyplace.
Hey, let me buy you a drink.
You guys in blue, you're doin' a hell of a job.
- Trap, you'll never make it home.
- Lots of guys do.
I know one guy shipped himself home in a harp case.
That took a lot of pluck.
See ya in the funny papers.
- Trap - Hey, Hawk, get outta the way.
- I don't wanna use violence.
- Then I will.
- Stop him, Frank!
- Uh, hey, Frank, your message service called.
- Your brain won't be ready for a week.
- Oh, buzz off.
- I can buy and sell you.
- Oh, you're so smart.
- You got in on Pioneer Aviation.
- I don't know anything about Pioneer Aviation.
- I never saw that letter.
- What letter, Frank?
- The one I don't know anything about.
- The one under the pillow?
- That's the one.
- Read this, Trap.
You gotta be kiddin'.
My eyes are in my duffel bag.
It's to his stockbroker.
"Buy immediately all shares possible of Pioneer Aviation".
- What's so funny?
- There is no Pioneer Aviation!
I made it up!
- Why?
- To help you look foolish!
I don't need your help.
Coming through.
-  -  I gotta get some more of those.
- You get that in?
I can't see.
- How's your head?
- Fine.
If only this guy wouldn't bleed so loud.
Clamp.
- Clamp.
Kelly, we need some more sponges here.
Sponge.
Margaret, you must believe me.
I'm truly sorry.
-  Sponge, Doctor.
- Margaret, I'll do anything.
I'll get down on my knees.
I'll kiss your feet.
My tent.
8:00.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Slight temperature, Doctor.
He's responding to antibiotics.
Okay, continue treatment.
Try to get better by 6:00.
I'm going to the movies and I wanna have a free mind.
- How come you're not responding to me?
- Pardon?
I put on something I thought would drive you wild.
- What?
- Clean socks.
Sir, a helicopter crashed.
There's a broken arm in O.R. Let's hope there's a patient attached.
Major, give me a hand.
Later I'll give you one of mine.
- Much pain?
- Not bad.
- Clean up the abrasions.
- Yes, Doctor.
Colonel Flagg's X ray, sir.
What happened to the chopper pilot?
He walked away without a scratch.
Probably asleep at the wheel.
That makes you nice and relaxed.
Colonel, you got a fractured radius.
Congratulations.
Congratulations?
Yeah, you might have landed on your head and screwed yourself into the ground.
Just get on with it, huh?
- Major, expose the arm, please.
- Yes, Doctor.
Oh.
Ever thought of going into burlesque, Colonel?
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Then try to look it.
- What kind of a place is this?
- What do you care?
We're open 24 hours a day and the second cup of coffee is free.
- Morphine.
- No morphine for me.
- Well, it's certainly not for me.
- Colonel, this will be very painful.
- Forget it.
- Perhaps you'd care to bite on a bullet.
Just do it.
Stockinette, please.
I want to talk to your commanding officer.
Well, right after we set this, we x-ray it.
And if it's not right, we do it again.
Then you can see my commanding officer, who's not right, but he won't let us do him again.
- What's your name, fella?
- Dr. Wasserman.
I'm looking for a cure for V.D. And I thought I'd start here.
Ready?
- Uh, sir?
- Yo.
Colonel Flagg is right outside inside here, sir.
Oh, Colonel Flagg.
Colonel, I want to talk to you in private, without the corporal.
Oh, you can say anything you want in front of him.
Okay, I will.
Get out.
Yes, sir.
- I see they got the wing patched up.
- Yeah.
- Care for a belt?
- No, thank you.
Hot enough for ya?
- Colonel.
- Colonel?
What's your clearance?
Oh, I go through the door with about an inch to spare.
I mean, security-wise.
Oh, well, we're a hospital.
Colonel, I'm gonna have to trust you.
Well, believe me, you can, Colonel Flagg.
Major Brooks.
Lieutenant Carter.
Ensign Troy.
Captain Louise Klein?
I'm C.I.A. C.I.A.?
Wow!
That damn chopper crash may have ruined a very sensitive mission.
Colonel Flagg was never here.
Tell your people.
You can fill out a file on me using any one of these.
Right.
Uh, just let me get your names down here.
Don't write.
Memorize.
One.
And don't use "Louise".
I'll need that next week in Tokyo.
Right.
I don't know how long I'll be here.
That all depends on H.Q. - H.Q. - H.Q.?
Whoever told you about H.Q.?
- Well, you told me, Colonel Flagg.
- Who's Colonel Flagg?
I mean, I, uh Gee, could could I just look at the cards again?
I forgot who all of you are.
Step outside, Colonel.
I wanna make a call.
All right.
Can I get the number for you?
I don't know the number.
Then how do you make the call?
I have to throw up.
The number's in a capsule.
Well, I'll just run along then.
- Colonel.
- Hmm?
- Not a word.
- Oh, don't worry, Colonel.
I don't wanna get in Dutch.
Dutch?
Colonel, I'm authorized to kill without requesting permission from my superiors.
Oh.
Well, I imagine that cuts down on the old paperwork.
You'll never know what hit you.
Your toothbrush could go off in your mouth.
You could find a tarantula in your shorts.
We could booby-trap a nurse.
- Hey, sirs.
- And ma'am.
And ma'am.
Boy, did I ever just hear something by accident in the office.
You've been giving the wall a physical again, Radar?
Sit down and tell us.
Uh, Corporal O'Reilly's high chair, please.
You know that Colonel Flagg?
You fixed his arm?
He's a C.P.A. No, really.
I heard him tell Colonel Blake to keep it quiet, that he's on a secret mission.
Radar, you mean C.I.A. Wow!
- To think I took his shirt off.
- Well, why would you do that?
I had to break his arm, Frank.
He was lusting after Margaret.
Those guys are doped up most of the time, you know.
Doped up on patriotism, fella.
- Something in short supply here.
- Amen.
Radar, we're running low.
Get another order of Yankee Doodle.
Yes, sir.
Gee, what a screwy bunch.
- Can you believe that Frank?
- They might make him the 49th state.
Don't move.
You're under arrest.
Vinny Pratt!
What a small war.
TrapperJohn Mclntyre, the old dirty doctor.
Vinny Pratt, Hawkeye Pierce.
Vinny and I go way back.
I introduced him to his wife.
Now you're here to kill him, right?
- Care for a belt?
- No, thanks.
I'm here on business.
You?
Trap.
Can I talk in front of him?
Go ahead.
I had his tongue cut out.
- Makes it very hard to lick stamps.
- I'm with Intelligence.
G2.
Our people monitored a call from here.
You have a Colonel Flagg on some kind of a mission.
His chopper crashed.
He broke his arm.
Oh.
That old trick.
What trick?
I set the arm.
I saw the X rays.
Well, believe me, if I know Flagg, he ordered the chopper to crash, got out and hit himself with a hammer.
Come on.
It's a switch on the way he infiltrated the C.I.D. Last year.
He drove his jeep into a wall, set himself on fire.
Is this guy available for kids' parties?
Why would this character wanna infiltrate a hospital?
Well, that's what I'm here to find out what they're up to and stop them.
I don't get it.
What do you mean "they," "them"?
Aren't "them" all part of"we"?
Isn't "them" "us"?
Steady, pal.
They always try to make a big score around appropriation time.
A little showboat for the Senate.
Now, last year they beat us out of $20 million.
Oh, you could make that up out of petty cash.
There must be something pretty big cooking here for them to send Flagg.
My orders are to find out what that is.
From now on, I'm Captain Perkins.
Priest.
We already got a priest.
Well, then I'm Captain Stone.
Engineer.
- Colonel Blake?
- Yeah?
There's a Captain Stone out there that's in here too, sir.
Colonel Blake.
- Captain Stone.
- That's not my real name.
- Oh, boy.
- I'm Major Strauss.
G2.
- Hey, what's going on with you guys?
- "Guys"?
I never heard of Colonel Flagg.
Let me level with you, Colonel.
My people wanna know what Flagg's people are up to.
Why do we have to be in the middle?
Can't you let my people go?
I expect your full cooperation, Colonel.
- Look, give me a break, Strauss.
- Call me Pratt.
- But Stone is definitely out?
- Out.
Man alive, I'm trying to run a hospital, be an administrator, give orders.
I've got no time for Intelligence.
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.
Full cooperation, Colonel.
What's this?
Paid bill from the Happy Hour Motel, Elkhart, Indiana.
June 1948.
That is your signature, isn't it, "Mr. Carl Williams and daughter"?
Beside the blurred license plate number?
- So?
- So, the electric blanket control in Room 312 was a microphone.
Holy cow!
The doorknob was a camera.
Linda Collins.
That rent-a-car girl in Houston.
Remember?
The A.M.A. Convention in '49.
They were folding the chairs by the time you finally got there.
Hey, where did you get this stuff?
We've got files on people who haven't been born yet.
Well, I'd deny it.
Anybody that says I don't is a dirty liar.
- Uh-huh.
- I mean, who's gonna believe this?
Nobody except your immediate family.
I'll leave you a copy.
Hey, this is nothing but a pack of filthy, lying lies, which is beneath my contempt about it, and you can count on my full and fearful cooperation.
Hey, how about a little golf?
I need the money.
Don't be so smart, or I'll x-ray that and show you what you're eating.
- Who you doing?
- Flagg.
I wanna check his arm.
Can you believe those guys?
We're a hospital, and they're playing spy.
I have a good mind to write my congressman.
With invisible ink, of course.
- Chasing their own tails.
- Shall we make it more interesting?
- Uh-huh.
- Tell Captain Stone I'll see him next.
- Mm-hmm.
You got it.
- Okay.
- Captain Stone?
- Sit right there at the table, please.
- Engineer?
- I hear he moonlights as a priest.
His name is not Stone.
It's really Martinez.
How do you know, Colonel Flagg?
My name is not Flagg.
Ask your C.O. It's Carter.
Uh-huh.
Can I trust you, Pierce?
If that's who I am.
I'm with the C.I.D., although I told your boss I was with the C.I.A.
It throws people off who think I'm with the C.I.C. I'll go along with you there.
If his people sent Martinez, then there's something big brewing here.
- Hmm.
Probably.
- I'm not leaving till I find out what.
Well, I can't give you a medical excuse.
I did too good a job on your arm.
- You did, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, now I can give you a medical excuse.
All right, Corporal, read back what you've got.
Uh, yes, sir.
"To the Far East Export-Import Company, - Right.
Go on.
- Yes, sir.
"Mary had a little lamb.
Stop.
My dog has fleas.
Stop".
Good.
There's a bit more.
Mairzy doats and dozey doats, and I'll be home for Christmas.
You got that?
Uh Uh, just a moment, sir.
Uh, okay.
Sign it: Your loving son, Queen Victoria.
Really?
You told me to keep you up on what he's doing.
- "Mary had a little lamb".
- He knows I'm here.
- How?
- I'm Mary.
I hate to tell you this, Mary, but your dog has fleas.
Mm-hmm.
We're both on the same trail.
But he's waiting for me to bird-dog.
You do, and you'll clean it up.
- Can this man be trusted?
- He's true-blue.
- I wanna use him for messages.
- He's perfect.
Fits into any envelope.
Aw, come on.
I can't surface.
He's got me tagged.
I'm G2.
- You're to keep him under surveillance.
- Colonel Flagg?
- Queen Victoria.
- Major Carter.
- They're all him.
- Or her, as the case may be.
I think I understand.
- Then you're the only one.
- Go, son.
Radar.
If you're captured, you'll have to eat those binoculars.
What's Flagg's target?
What's his caper?
Could it be a patient?
A nurse?
A doctor?
- Hello, Frank.
- Hi, Frank.
A lot you care.
Oh.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
Oh.
Old buddy of mine.
Captain Stone, engineer.
- Major Burns, doctor, surgeon.
- Staff paranoid.
Uh, what brings you to the 4077 th, Captain?
- Survey mission, Major.
- Oh.
Corps of Engineers believes that army hospitals can not only be mobile but amphibious.
I've had that idea for a long time.
Put the hospital, the O.R., the lab, the whole shebang up on pontoons and head for the high seas.
We could call ourselves the Titanic.
Captain, I'm afraid your friend here and his friend here derive perverted pleasure from playing down American ingenuity and know-how.
That's true.
I was among those who said this hospital would never fly.
I love this country more than both of you put together.
I'll tell ya, when that flag goes up the pole every morning, I go with it.
We have a hell of a time at night folding him and putting him away.
Oh, hooey balooey.
Well, good luck on your project, Captain, and anchors aweigh.
- Pretty gung ho.
- #And I don't care # You know, I sometimes wonder about Frank and his wall-to-wall patriotism.
They say Benedict Arnold used to be the first one to stand whenever Washington came into the room.
But the minute Washington left, he started throwing erasers and tried to take over the country.
There is the type who protest too much.
- That's right.
- Oh, yeah.
I think I'll have a little look-see into his file.
-  Right now?
- No.
If I ask the colonel to see the major's file and they're co-subversives in sub-security profile, they'll do the old dossier switcheroo, and I'll chalk up a zilch.
Boy, I wish you came He means he'll sneak into the files tonight.
Right?
It's called breaking and entering.
Good thing you're a cop.
Otherwise, that's illegal.
You know?
I've asked you to have a drink because I need help.
Now, from the complaints I've heard, you're my kind of people.
Military, dedicated and a little bit fanatic about good sense.
That's us.
I think I can trust you.
I'm I'm with the C.I.C. - Not the C.I.A.?
- No.
I just tell people that so they'll think I'm with the C.I.D. I think I understand.
Now, you people got yourself a snootful of security problems around here.
Either of you know a G2 man named Stone?
He's an engineer.
You're crazy, buddy.
Call me that again, I'll reach into your throat and pull your heart out.
Please, Frank.
I've seen him with his shirt off.
I've got to know who or what this Stone's after.
Then you should see my file.
He's kept a complete list of everybody in this camp who's ever been subversive or promoted ahead of certain other doctors just because they showed off by saving more lives.
- I'd like to have a glimmer at that.
- Radar!
- I'm not, sir.
- You're not what?
You're eavesdropping.
Corporal.
Sir?
How'd you like a nose full of nickels?
Not a whole lot, sir.
- Do you like the jukebox, son?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Well, if you don't get lost, I'm gonna put your head through the glass and pull it out through the coin return.
Anything else, sir, before I go to the latrine?
- Disappear.
- Mm-hmm.
I heard him.
He's going into Major Burns' file.
Well, looks like we're gonna have a doubleheader tonight.
We should let Flagg go first.
He's the senior crazy.
- Do you know what he said to me?
- Wait a minute.
Hawk, shall we make Frank's files a little more colorful?
Good idea, Raleigh.
What'd he say to you, Radar?
He said he was gonna shove nickels up my nose.
No kidding.
What song was he gonna play?
Is that the signal?
Either that or Marlene Dietrich's back in town.
Go, tiger.
Burns, get up!
Let's go, mister!
- What is it?
- You're under arrest as a subversive.
Whatever game you're playing, I've got enough pictures of your file to have you executed for the rest of your life.
- Subversive?
- Can't be.
He's got every record Kate Smith ever made.
- Get dressed.
You're coming with me.
- Hold it, Flagg.
He's mine.
- You'll have to take a number and wait.
- Or call ahead.
Everybody wants to arrest Frank Burns this time of year.
Arrest me?
What for, for heaven's sake?
- You're a communist.
- He's a fascist.
I'm not either.
I'm nothing.
We'll vouch for that.
I got a list of 17 left-wing charities and organizations you've contributed to.
I never gave a dime to charity.
I believe every man has the right to be poor.
That doesn't explain these communist front groups.
Those were just a front for these.
Aha.
There's a new front moving in.
This shows your radical right-wing activities, from being an usher at a Bund meeting in 1939 to pledging $25 to a Martin Bormann telethon in Argentina.
There's more here, Comrade Burns.
What?
Frank, you're entitled to one phone call to the Kremlin.
Do you deny that last month in Tokyo you attended the Russian Ballet?
What's wrong with going to the ballet, for Pete's sake?
That's how you people operate.
Today you're dancing in Tokyo, tomorrow all over Washington.
You gotta keep on your toes with the Russian Ballet.
Now about this little item?
Running a linen laundry for the Ku Klux Klan?
I never!
It's a lie!
They're all lies!
- Well, somebody's lying.
-  That's right.
And we know who it is.
It's us.
You two were so intent on finding some breach of security, some leak.
You don't need the real thing.
You guys are self-leaking.
Trying to protect your jobs until you get to the old spies home.
- You could do ten years for this.
- For doctor file doctoring?
You can't arrest us.
We got a run-of-the-war contract.
Choppers!
Choppers, sirs.
Incoming wounded.
Fellas, it's been both a privilege and a nightmare meeting you.
Trap, I owe you one.
You really hit me below the belt.
Come see me.
I do hernias.
Let's get to work, Frank.
Say "sieg heil" or "or-chi-chornya" to the nice gentlemen.
You've slandered one of the finest Americans since my father.
Buy you a cup of coffee, Sam?
Why not?
