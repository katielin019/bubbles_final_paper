{START OF EPISODE 1}
Nanu, nanu!
Here's your coffee, Mr. Bickley.
Ahh.
There you go.
Mm, just like Mom used to make.
Oh, well, thank you.
Mom's coffee was awful too.
Thanks a lot.
Mm, Mr. Bickley, I was wondering if you wanted to go to Utah with Mork and me to visit Dad.
You're not gonna believe this.
He got a job with a symphony orchestra.
It's his big debut.
I'm so proud of him.
I never liked your dad much.
Thanks.
That's a nice thing to say.
Oh, it's not his fault.
I never liked anybody very much.
But I must say, it's not easy for a man to sell his business and take a new job.
I know.
That's why this job is so perfect for him.
He's always wanted to be a symphony conductor, and this orchestra is gonna take him around the country.
Ah, yes.
Zubin McConnell.
Ha!
Don't panic.
Oh, no, not again.
It's nothing serious.
Just the world as we know it is coming to an end.
Ah, it's about time.
The, uh, world is coming The world as we know it.
The world as we know it is coming to an end.
Right.
You see, I went downtown to buy a book, the Life and Hard Times of Princess Rainier of Monaco, and there, plastered on every newspaper, was "energy crisis".
Don't panic.
Don't panic.
Remain calm.
Energy crisis.
Big deal.
Big deal?
It is a big deal, Mr. Smarty-Pants Republican.
Unless we find an alternative source of energy for oil, we have to conserve, and I was making darn sure we conserve.
Oh, Mork, what were you doing?
I shot out the streetlights in downtown Boulder.
I took out all the traffic lights too.
I'm gonna kinda miss them though.
Red, yellow, green.
Such festive colors.
They were so pretty.
People used to stop their cars and watch them change.
Mork, relax, okay?
Relax?
Relax?
How can I relax?
Mindy, there's a world beyond I Love Lucy.
Don't you understand?
We're running out of fossil fuels.
There aren't any more dinosaurs dying, and Dinah Shore is still in residuals.
It's a whole different world.
And pretty soon, they'll be drilling in the cemeteries looking for oil.
I can see the advertising slogans now: "Put our relative in your tank".
And they'll have testimonials: "Hi, I got 20 miles to the gallon using my Aunt Tess".
Mork, there is an energy crisis, and in 50 or 60 years, we probably won't have any more oil.
But a lot of people believe that the oil companies are just using scare tactics so they can hike the prices.
Somebody is getting very rich at our expense.
Why would someone wanna get rich at someone else's expense?
Let me put it to you this way.
Some of us believe the people who own the oil are shaking down the rest of the world.
Oh, so that's why they call it shakes, for the booty.
As long as the oil companies keep backing the politicians Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
What's so funny about that?
Nothing.
Ha-ha-ha!
Well, you just laughed.
No, I didn't.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
There you go again.
That was a sneeze.
Are you making fun of me?
If that's your sneeze, take my advice.
Never go to a funeral in the rain.
Look at you, Mork.
You're soaking wet.
Why don't you take off your clothes?
Mork Oh, good idea.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Gesundheit.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Mork, you're really catching a cold.
Come here.
I'm gonna give you something.
Here.
Take one of these.
What is it?
It's a cold capsule.
It'll help shrink your nasal membranes and clear your head.
All right.
Ow.
Mork!
You don't put it in your ear.
Try swallowing it.
Swallow it?
That's the wrong way.
I've got a head cold.
Trust me.
Well, okay, but I'm warning you, if I swallow this, there's a darn good chance you'll never see it again.
Ar, ar!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ha!
That boy is a little short from the neck up.
He doesn't even know how to take a cold tablet.
Well, he hasn't been sick much.
You don't have to have a high fever to know where to stick the thermometer.
So, what about Dad's concert?
Are you gonna make the trip with Mork and me?
Who do I have to share the back seat with, Mork or your grandmother?
Oh, you don't know.
Grandma's already there.
She's gonna make the entire tour with Dad.
Wow!
Every conductor's dream, a 78-year-old groupie.
Ha!
We'll have to work on his attitude.
Eeeee!
What are you doing?
!
I just eliminated a negative.
There's one streetlight that's sucked his last watt.
Stop it, Mork!
That is wrong!
Mindy, don't you think I know right from wrong?
Well, yes, but you just can't run around doing right all the time.
It's It's just not right.
Shazbat.
Mayday.
Amrak.
Faze and confusion.
Just when I think I have Earth communication down, right is wrong.
All right, readjust.
Famous architect, Frank Lloyd Wrong.
Famous soul group, the Wrongous Brothers.
Bo Didn't-Do-Diddley.
Mork, you've gotta understand.
You just can't go around taking the law into your own hands.
Otherwise, you're nothing more than a vigilante.
Do you know what a vigilante is?
Sure I know what a vigilante is.
It's a guy who's looking for a girl who's a vigilan.
They're an endangered species.
Mindy, I know what I did was wrong, but I'm sorry.
Oh, well.
It's okay, Mork, just as long as you don't go around breaking any more streetlights.
Promise?
Promise.
Good.
What did you do to your nightshirt?
Mindy, I feel guilty, but I think that's rather a personal question.
I mean, when did you buy the new one?
Look, it's at least two sizes too big for you.
See how the sleeves come over your hands like this?
Wait a minute, here.
You look like a Ku Klux candy cane.
Mindy.
Mindy, this is the same cap and the same nightshirt I've always had.
Well, it can't be, Mork.
Look how big it is for you.
Mindy, how tall am I?
I don't know.
Usually you're about About like that.
But you used to be up there.
Oh, no.
You know that pill you gave me to shrink my nasal membranes?
I forgot.
We Orkans are all membrane.
Oh, Mork, that's impossible.
A person doesn't just shrink.
Oh, yeah?
Then how come my shorts just fell off?
Oh, Mork, this book covers every disease known to man.
There's not a word in here about shrinking.
I can always play shortstop.
Ar, ar, ar!
How can you make jokes?
In less than one day, you have shrunk down to half your size.
This tiny-time capsule can't go on forever.
In the meantime, in the words of Esther Williams, I've gotta go with the flow.
Don't be sad.
Thanks for the new clothes anyway.
I mean, my old clothes are getting to be a hassle.
Last night in my sleep I rolled over and my nightshirt didn't.
Yeah.
I borrowed those from Billy's mom from across the street.
I'm sorry I didn't get you any shoes that fit.
Ah, my old shoes are fine.
I kinda consider them my own personal tribute to Emmett Kelly.
Mork, when are you gonna face reality?
You are shrinking.
Yeah, but you gotta look on the bright side, Mindy.
There's gotta be a pony in here somewhere.
You know, I could be Paul Williams' valet.
Some people say, "If I knew then, what I know now".
Well, I've got my eye on this cute little 8-year-old.
She's got the body of a 6-year old though, Mind.
Mork, stop it!
Mindy, I'm sorry.
There's no use both of us being scared to death.
I know.
The least you can let me do is call a doctor.
A normal doctor isn't good for me, Mind.
I have a different metabolism.
That's why I have to call a shrink.
Oh, I know.
A little Orkan humor, right?
Ar, ar.
A little Orkan humor, Mindy?
Is that a short joke?
Real funny, Mindy.
So I called in a shrink.
Big deal!
He'll get here soon.
He'll be here soon.
Don't worry.
A shrink is a slang word for a psychiatrist.
Not mine.
No, not my shrink.
Besides, he told me I don't care what he told you.
A shrink has nothing to do with anything that's shrunk.
Who says we don't make house calls anymore?
Mork, it's for you.
Where is the little fella?
Straight ahead and down.
Will you boys please get out?
Let the shrimp boat sink in dignity.
Oh, you're all heart.
A good shrink has to be.
I said get out!
Boogie-oogie-oogie!
Will you get that ugly thing away from me?
There's no telling where it's been.
Mindy, you remember Dr. Exidor.
Please, don't call me "doctor," Mork.
I refuse to be put in a category with those quacks.
Boogie-oogie-oogie!
However, if you insist on a label, call me Ms. That's good.
It goes with the outfit.
Speaking of outfits, I love yours, Mork.
Oh.
Except the duck feet have got to go.
Can I have them when you Don't talk like that.
He's not gonna shrink any more.
Why, of course not.
But if I were you, I'd take some snapshots just to be safe.
How are you feeling, Mork?
Oh, not bad.
A little short of breath.
Ar, ar, ar.
Now, this has gone too far.
What you need is a real doctor.
Oh, you mean like a real doctor that golfs on Wednesday, fee-splits on Thursday, puts you on hold on Friday?
Mork, most doctors are highly qualified.
Oh, sure, in their own backward ways.
But I'm strides ahead of them.
And I don't mean little froggy steps.
I mean giant strides ahead.
Giant strides ahead of every doctor in the world.
You mean you're bigger than Dr. Joyce Brothers?
I even have prettier hair.
Are you bigger than Doc Severinsen?
Dr. Scholl's?
Dr Pepper?
Oh, please!
We're not talking fruity-flavored drinks, Mork.
We're talking hard, scientific facts based on years of research, dedication, experimentation.
Don't step there!
Step on a crack, break your mother's back.
Mork, this guy is no better than a witch doctor.
Oh, that's That's Ms. Witch Doctor, Mindy.
Thank you, Mork.
Now then, let's discuss those symptoms.
Just lie back.
Fine.
A pencil for shorthand.
Sorry.
Tell me do you get mad when you hear the song "Short People"?
No.
Would you like to be Ricardo Montalban's sidekick?
Not my fantasy.
Do you look up to Paul Williams?
No, but I can take him a little bit at a time.
That's it.
You're cured.
What?
!
You are out of your skull.
Did you hear that, Pedro?
La seÃ±ora no en casa.
I'm no en casa?
You're no en casa!
He is getting small.
My dear lady!
There never has been anything wrong with him.
The rest of us are getting bigger.
What?
Just last night, Walter Cronkite said the entire world is suffering inflation.
Out!
Goodbye, you normal kind of guy.
You're one lucky cat.
Ciao, ciao, ciao.
Hey, you kids!
Quit poking that burro!
Sorry, Pedro, you've got to go on ahead!
I'll be there shortly!
Oop!
Well, Mork, you just gotta think positive.
The effects of that pill will have to wear off soon and Uh and then you'll be back to your normal size.
You've already stopped shrinking.
I think.
Thanks for the encouragement, Mindy.
But a few hours ago, this shirt used to be form-fitting, and either I've discovered a revolutionary new diet, or I'm still shrinking.
What am I gonna do, Mind?
I don't know.
How does the suit fit?
Oh, nice, considering.
Yeah.
I'm really sorry the store was out of Ken dolls.
Yeah, me too.
I feel kind of funny wearing Tacky Bob clothes.
Well, better late than never.
Ar.
There are certain advantages to being small, though.
At least you can get an entire living room set for $6 and some change.
Yeah.
Look, Mork, I know it looks like you've stopped shrinking, but I really wish you'd let me take you to a doctor.
Don't you think a doctor would be suspicious that I'm an alien?
I'm smaller than things that most people have removed.
Okay, no doctors.
But how do you know you're gonna return to your normal size?
Well, I haven't shrank in over an hour.
Hey, in no time at all, I'll just be growing real big again.
No time "a tall".
Ar, ar, ar.
Ar, ar, ar.
Mind, don't you have to be going to school today?
Yeah, I really should.
I have a journalism exam.
But I don't wanna leave you.
Hey, Mindy, I'm a big boy now.
Get out of here before I spank your ankles.
Okay.
Are you sure?
Mindy.
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, get outta here.
Take a hike.
Well, is there anything I can get you while I'm out?
Well, you can pick me up a Barbie doll, the one with all the accessories.
Oh, by the way, the exterminator man is supposed to come today Heh, heh.
I guess better cancel that, huh?
Sorry.
See you later.
Oh, no!
Another time capsule just went o-o-off!
This means I'm still shrinking.
Oh, I'm glad I got rid of Mindy so she didn't have to see this.
Pretty soon I'm gonna be a speck of dead meat.
Woe is me.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork  Mork calling Orson.
Come in, sir.
"Sir"?
You called me "sir"?
You usually start your report with one of your snide little fat jokes.
I'm in big trouble, Orson.
Not exactly big.
It's kind of the opposite.
What are you talking about?
I took some Earth medication that's making me shrink.
If I don't stop, I'm gonna dwindle away to nothing.
Waa-ah-aah!
See?
The outside of me shrank again.
It's getting worse.
You've got to do something, Mork.
Isn't there anything on Earth that will make things grow?
All right, let's see I could stand in fertilizer, but the smell would kill me.
There must be something else.
Come on, Mork, think.
Thanks for the pressure.
Let's see Uh-huh.
Well, Mindy's into health food.
She takes brewer's yeast.
Does yeast make Mindy grow?
No.
But yeast makes bread grow, and this might work for me.
It's a million-to-one shot, but it's the only shot I've got.
See, if I don't stop it, I'm gonna see how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
Well, good luck, Mork.
Thank you, mon gÃ©nÃ©ral.
This is Mork, signing off, maybe for the last time.
Nanu.
Oh, I feel like the Incredible Hulk in reverse.
What am I gonna do?
I don't  On one hand, voilÃ !
On the other hand, heavy sigh.
There's the yeast, but it might as well be on the other side of the Rockies.
What?
Wha-ah!
Mondo vertigo.
It's Hitchcock city.
I want to get down.
I don't want to end up as an alien pizza.
Ooh.
Oh, time to use the old noodle.
Phew!
I gotta tell Mindy she uses too much garlic.
I feel like Tarzan-elli hanging up here.
She has the only pasta in the world that has a half-life.
Yeah, I should be thankful though she made spaghetti.
Sure would be a drag to have to shimmy down succotash.
Ohh.
Mindy!
Mork!
Oh, Bick, not now.
I haven't got time for small talk.
Oh.
Hello?
Mork?
Mindy?
Bicky, you stay down there.
Daddy will be right back.
Mork?
I came over to borrow your book, you know, Cheryl Tiegs, the Early Years.
Mork?
It's too deep.
You'll never understand it.
Mindy?
Are you in the bedroom?
Oh, well, I guess they won't mind if I just borrow it.
I think I saw it over there.
Oh, no!
Come on, Cheryl.
Don't be shy.
The whole world has seen that bathing suit by now.
Oh!
Uh-oh!
It's happening again.
Oh, hi, Bicky.
I told you to wait downstairs.
I'll find that book in a minute, and we'll go for a nice walk.
How much Is that doggy in the window?
Oh, no!
Aah!
Tiny feets, don't fail me now!
Oh Ah.
Uh-oh, I found it.
Come on, Bicky, let's go.
Come on.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I just came over to borrow Mork's book.
He said I could.
You saw Mork?
A couple of days ago.
Oh.
The door was unlocked.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, no.
Not at all.
I'll tell Mork that you borrowed his book.
Thanks.
See ya.
Mork.
Mork, where are you?
Mork?
Ugh.
Mork?
Mind, is that you?
Mork?
Oh.
I love Steamboat Willie.
Oh!
Mindy!
Mindy!
Mindy!
Mindy!
Mind!
Min!
Oh, Min!
Mindy!
Mork, is that you?
Where are you?
Mork?
Mork?
!
Mindy!
Down here!
Careful where you step!
Oh, Mork!
Mork, you're still shrinking.
Mindy, I don't have much time left.
You've got to help me.
There's only one chance.
What is it?
I've got to get some of your brewer's yeast.
It's a chance in a million, but it might make me rise.
Hurry, please!
Okay.
I've got you.
You do great work, Mind.
Just don't applaud yourself.
This is no time for jokes.
Thanks for the lift, Mind.
I knew I was in good hands.
Ar!
Why is this happening?
I thought you'd stopped shrinking I don't know, Mind.
I guess it's another example of lousy living through chemistry.
Ar.
The smaller I get, the faster I shrink.
Well, it's gonna be all right.
Here's the yeast.
Whoa.
I think we've uncovered a little flaw in my plan.
I know!
I'll crush it up and dissolve it in water.
It's happening again!
Hurry, Mindy!
I am.
Hang on.
Hurry, Mind!
I'm rapidly becoming hindsi-i-i-ght!
I'm coming, Mork!
Mork!
Mindy!
Mindy!
: Mindy!
Oh, my God, he's gone!
: Mindy!
Mindy!
Mindy!
Mindy!
MORK : Mindy!
Mindy!
Mindy!
Mindy!
Mindy!
Mindy!
Mindy!
Mindy!
Hello, Bossy.
Oh, you have something I need bad.
Well, thank you.
A little roomy.
I hope no one tries to milk me.
Ar, ar.
Boy, I must have shrank into a whole new universe.
You know, this planet's probably just a molecule on Mindy's tablecloth.
Either that or I somehow or other landed in the Ayatollah Khomeini's farm.
Ar, ar!
Well, at least if you're wearing pants, it's gotta be an intelligent society, or at least fashionable.
Well, I just hope they're friendly.
Here I am, a coward in a brave new world.
What would Bert Lahr do in a situation like this?
I know.
Haul Oz out of here.
Well, moo gesundheit.
Ah.
Hm.
Wah!
Got him!
God bless you and keep you, and we got you.
You certainly are well-dressed for being so hostile.
One, two, three, fore!
Come on, spy, sing along.
Oh, it's a silly quirk but I hardly ever sing along with people who tie me up.
What do you say, fellas?
Should we take five?
I might tell you good idea.
Excuse me, question.
Why is there furniture in the middle of a field?
Good grief, our house has been stolen.
Wait a minute.
There's something about you guys, like I've met you before.
On a telethon perhaps?
But this I must say.
Hi, I'm Bob "There's big bucks in comedy" Faith.
I think we're being a little rude to our prisoner here.
We're sort of violating the rules of the Geneva "Have a nice day" Convention.
I think we should be introducing ourselves.
Hello!
I'm Jerry Looney!
Try to get over that, Jerry.
Hi, I'm Danny St. Tommy, and here's a picture of my family.
There's my daughter, St. Marlo, my son, St. Rusty, and here's my dog, St. Spot.
I I don't mean to pry, but why am I all tied up?
All right, already.
Don't you know there's a rebellion going on?
We're an outrageous, zany bunch of revolutionaries  called the Sillies.
Ha-ha.
And we're revolting BOB &  We are?
against the Glums.
And I just want to say we think you're a spy.
A spy?
But for who?
The evil king and his Glums.
Sounds like a punk-rock group.
Seriously, folks, I think we should hit the road to camp.
Ready, aim, fire!
The arrow's funny, kid, but get yourself a tux, huh?
Well, excu-u-u-u-se me!
Whoa, so this is comedy purgatory.
This isn't a guerrilla camp.
This is high camp.
Look at all this great humor going to waste and because the king won't let people laugh.
I hate to be kind of a living clichÃ©, but when are you gonna take me to your leader?
Well, that all depends on whether our leader is in camp or still working undercover in the king's castle.
Oh.
Leader, leader?
Are you in?
This is Bob "We think we caught a spy who fell from the sky" Faith.
Have him washed and sent to my tent.
Uh-huh.
Ahh!
You know something?
Even by my standards, you guys are very bizarre.
Wait, wait.
I feel like a real drip.
Please.
I'll be out in a minute.
I'm slipping into something more comfortable.
I'll slip out of something uncomfortable.
So you're a spy.
Mindy!
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy!
Mindy, Mind That's Mandy, Mandy, Mandy, pal.
Mandy?
Oh, no.
Einstein was right.
I've fallen into a parallel universe.
This is incredible.
This is the ultimate dÃ©jÃ  vu.
It's dÃ©jÃ -jÃ  vu-vu.
What?
I come from another planet.
Actually, two other planets.
But don't worry about that.
I came from a place where there's a clone of you named Mindy.
She's a girl I live with.
And even the furniture is the same.
Everything is similar.
It's parallel!
Look, pal, if you're trying to break in a new act, I'm really too busy.
I happen to have a revolution to run.
And, uh, where'd you get the silly pants?
It looks like something a cow should be wearing.
Why don't you go back there and change?
Anything would be better than that.
Right, Mand Mind Uh Whoa.
I can prove to you that I come from a parallel universe.
Oh?
Is there a wicker chest in front of you?
Yes.
On Earth, the Mindy I know keeps her high school graduation picture hidden there, back when she was el-chubbo and used to give fish kisses.
Oh!
How did you know that?
Oh.
I also know that inside there is a flimsy-type nightgown that is so sheer she hasn't got the nerve to wear it.
Well, I'll wear that someday.
Before I give you my final proof, one question: Is there anybody on this planet who drinks with their finger?
No.
How would you like your lake drained?
Now it's your turn.
Tell me about this revolution you're planning.
Well, the name of this planet is Mirth.
And it used to be a pretty happy place to live until five years ago when this king took over.
He's the head of the Glum Party.
And if you can believe this, he actually outlawed humor.
So I formed a band of Sillies to overthrow the Glums.
That's one part that doesn't fit though.
You're not silly at all.
I'm not silly but I like to laugh.
I appreciate humor.
I think it's our God-given right to be happy, and that alone is worth fighting for.
The king just wants everybody to be miserable.
This king sounds like a real nimnol.
Oh, he's worse than that.
He's a crook too.
He actually cut off our energy supply just so he could raise the rates and make everybody else more glum.
So now we only have electricity every other day.
I'm odd.
You know, Mork, you could help our cause.
Me?
Morko the schlug?
No, you don't need that kind of help.
No.
All my men are known, but you aren't.
If you could get a job at the castle, well, then, you could be our spy.
All we have to do is prove that the king is a crook, and I know even his glums would turn against him.
And then my people can laugh again.
Yeah.
But you don't just knock on a castle door and say, "Hello, Kelly boy".
besides, I don't do moats.
Ar, Ar.
No, there's no problem.
I work in the castle.
I can make sure you get a job.
Yeah, but if you work there, why do you need me?
I'm the head of public information.
They don't tell me anything.
Oh, Mork, please.
I'm kind of new at this joke-and-dagger stuff, but All right.
I'll do it for you.
Oh, Mork.
Oh.
This 007 stuff sure is kayo.
Yeah, but what kind of a job can you get me in a castle?
Announcing the new court serious.
Depressing morning, ladies and gentlemen.
Whoa!
In today's news, first, the Foul Jones Industrial Averages: War and pestilence up in heavy trading.
Whoa!
But I want to grieve to you.
The Royal Medical Society said today that everything causes respiratory disease.
Flus at eleven.
Whoa!
That's good stuff.
It'll really depress the king.
He'll love it.
Bick!
Bick Maintain.
Maintain.
Catchy walk too.
Mork, this is Marvin, the king's financial advisor and bootblack.
Mandy, I want this released to the press as soon as possible.
Certainly.
Go!
Yes, sir.
Now remember, when you meet the king, it's negative, negative, negative.
And whatever you do, don't smile.
He won't even know I have teeth.
Whoa!
Good boy.
Good boy.
Excuse me.
Announcing his majesty, king of the Glums, emperor of Mirth, and conqueror of the renegade chipmunks.
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
All right, all right.
Friend of everything brown, and absolute owner of all electricity.
Exidor!
Exidor?
My name isn't Exidor.
My name is Exidon!
Oh, sorry, king's X. But, excuse me, but you have little eyes painted on your eyelids.
Are you paranoid?
No.
Why do you ask?
I do this so that assassins don't know when I'm asleep.
Oh.
In school, they must have called you four eyes.
Whoa!
You should have heard what they called me when I wore glasses.
Children can be so cruel.
That's why I love them.
Why am I talking to a man who has just pinched the head off his little doll?
Your highness, this is your new court serious.
Actually, he has some fairly good material.
War, pestilence, disease.
Pretty heady stuff.
I promise I'll depress you.
I'll bring you down.
I'll bum you out.
I'll make you feel like trash.
Oh, please.
Oh, please You'll have to depress me later.
Business before pleasure.
You guards, out, before I have your heads cut off too!
Whoa!
Who-oh-oah!
Marvin, I wanna talk to you.
I wanna talk to you about the phony energy crisis.
Now, we're going to have to shut off even more power if we're going to make the people really miserable and glum.
And if we happen to make a couple of bucks along the way, what's it hurt?
Ixnay.
Ixnay.
If you can't trust your own court serious, who can you trust?
Whoa!
Boy, are you paranoid.
I've written my entire plan on this tape and signed it.
You wrote your plan on adhesive tape?
It's perfectly safe.
No one's allowed in my medicine cabinet.
The entire plan is there, except for the first I had to tape up a leak.
Whoa!
Psst, Mandy!
: Mork, is that you?
No, this is me.
That's a suit of armor, and this is my agent, Saul.
Shh!
No jokes.
Oh.
Shh!
Shh!
: Exidon admitted everything.
He is deliberately limiting the electricity.
His slogan is: "Power to the people on a rolling brownout basis".
Oh, if we could prove that, we could dethrone the king.
And then all the people could laugh again.
But it's just your word against his.
What we need is proof.
Proof?
I'll get you proof and I'll make it stick.
Be careful.
I don't want anything to happen to you.
Oh.
Shh.
Mandy, you're soft, just like Mindy.
Don't you worry about old Morko.
I'll take care of everything.
Maybe when all this dirty business is over we can get together and tickle each other's funny bone.
Ar, ar!
Shh!
Shh!
Mork, you've done it.
You've really done it!
Yeah, I figure we have him by the short wires now.
Oh, Mork, you've saved my people from a terrible tyrant.
Mm.
Did you hear something?
No, just fireworks.
Bombs bursting in the air, rockets' red glare.
Mm.
No, no, no, Mork.
It's probably nothing, but it wouldn't hurt to check.
I'll be right back, okay?
But, but, but Yes, all right.
I'll be right back.
We must be getting close.
Just look at Fifi and Raoul.
I'm just happy they're on our side.
Let's go!
Get her, boys!
Don't let her go!
So you fell for my little trap, eh?
I suspected you right from the start.
I knew that court serious was a spy.
Run, Mork, run!
Take the evidence to the people!
Run!
I'll be back for you, Mandy!
You'd better be back by noon tomorrow, unless you're into taxidermy!
Mandy  He can't talk.
He's out of breath.
Well, show us.
Mandy.
Exidon.
You mean they're with those two killer dogs, Raoul and Fifi?
All right, already.
I'll handle this.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Calm down, Mork, because we want you to take a picture of the three of us in front of our marquee.
Uh-huh.
Remember, I'm in the middle.
Make room for Danny.
Exidon and Mandy.
What about 'em?
They've captured her?
Oh, yeah?
Exidon, yeah?
Is a crook.
Yeah?
And Mandy?
Yeah?
Tastes like Mm?
Savor it?
Save her?
!
Why, the castle's an armed camp.
Armed camp?
Great audience.
Huh?
No good?
Sorry.
Something at noon.
The shiksa dies at noon.
Oh!
Now, God knows I'd do anything to help her, but God also knows there are thousands of troops surrounding the castle, and there are not enough of us to fight them.
Yeah.
You got an idea?
What a great idea, to build a balloon.
It took us all night but we did it.
I've seen cross-stitching before, but you guys are really men of the cloth.
Oh, I'm a very good seamstress.
We should've taken Dean with us.
Holy Toledo, we're passing over the troops.
Troops?
Hi, guys, I just wanna say it's a pleasure to be here on the front lines with you.
Bob, talk up into the balloon.
We need all the lift we can get.
Uh-oh.
I hope this thing doesn't spring a leak.
I haven't memorized all the exits yet.
You know, I think the altitude is getting to me.
From up here the planet looks almost round.
But I just want to say there's the castle.
Set down there, Jerry.
Aim for the courtyard.
Look out!
We're gonna hit the wall!
Oh.
We hit the wall.
Jerry, quick, throw out the rope.
Mork, take it back up.
It's Marvin the Evil.
No, not anymore.
It's Marvin the Swell now.
I've turned over a new leaf.
Graft and corruption is one thing, but executions aren't my cup of hemlock.
I'll drink to that.
First we have to save Mandy.
I'll show you where the dungeon is.
But you have to promise me first, you'll take me up, up and away in your beautiful balloon.
I'll take you anywhere, the 5th dimension, but now we've got a job to do.
Boys, grab your weapons.
Let's go.
Aahh!
Shh!
Shh!
Stop that laughing.
Stop it or this dungeon will have clown confetti all over it.
JERRY &  Pie, guys!
Ugh!
Ugh!
Argh!
Oh, Mork!
Oh, Mandy, I'm sorry about the cream all over the dungeon, but I freed the king's tapes to the people.
Oh, Mork, you risked your life for my people.
No, I did it for you.
Oh!
Hey, hey, this is no time to fool around!
We've got a balloon to catch.
Besides, we're running out of ammunition.
Save a pie for yourselves.
They'll never take us alive!
Hurry, the revolution has started.
The townspeople are attacking the castle.
Whoa!
Welcome to my world.
Prepare for your doom.
Well, I guess it's time we got our just deserts.
Now that's funny.
Now that's not funny!
Whoever did that, off with his head!
Okay!
Okay!
Off with his trigger finger, but that's the bottom line.
It's all over for you, Exidon.
The people are revolting.
They are?
They've read the tapes.
Tapes?
What tapes?
He's a crook, and we have the proof.
His entire plan is on tape.
It's binding evidence too.
Your noble king caused the power shortage.
Now try and sell your autobiography.
Nyah!
Off with everybody's head!
You caused the power shortage?
Off with everybody's head, except yours.
Ahh!
I think it's about time for me to goose step out of here.
Don't let him get away!
Hit him with a stick!
Shtick?
Oh, this is exciting.
Shades of the Magna Carta, Fourth of July, Bastille Day, Cinco de Mayo.
Allons-y de la Patrie Come on, Mandy.
Let's go, girl.
Come on, Mand, let's go!
Come on, Mand.
Up, up, up.
Come on.
Oh, Mork.
Thanks for helping us.
Mandy, what's wrong?
Oh, a shell.
I'll get I'll get you a doctor.
Mork, I got I got what I wanted.
My people are free.
Now they can laugh again.
You know, Mork, I think that if I'd ever really gotten to know you, I I could have  Tell Mindy that she's really lucky.
No, Mandy.
Come on.
You hang in there, girl.
It's not fair!
It's not fair!
It's not fair!
Oh, no!
What's happening?
I'm growing!
Mandy!
Mandy, I don't wanna leave you now, please.
Mandy, I don't wanna grow.
Mandy!
Mandy!
Mindy!
Oh.
Mindy!
Mindy, Mindy!
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy!
Mindy, Mindy!
Mork!
: Oh, Mork!
I You've been gone three days!
I thought you I thought you died.
Oh, Mind.
Oh, Mind, it's terrible.
But it was wonderful too.
I shrank down.
I was in a little, tiny parallel universe.
And everybody was there.
Exidor and Mr. Bickley and you were there.
But you died.
I It doesn't matter because you're back.
I can't believe it.
I missed you so.
Oh.
This This may be a little selfish of me, and I know no one lives forever, but I hope I I leave this life before you do, 'cause I never wanna lose you twice.
The molecules of the tablecloth became another universe.
And the planet I landed on must have been just an atom.
The society was advanced in some ways and backwards in others.
And the people, oh, especially Mandy.
Hum, boy  Mork, we've already discussed that.
Oh, I know that, your wideship.
Mork, I know this may be painful, but tell me exactly how you felt when Mandy passed on.
Hm.
Well I felt anger at first and anguish and a sense of deep loneliness.
I can't even fully comprehend one emotion.
All those emotions at once.
It must cause insanity.
Well, it does at first, sir.
Then after you have time to think, you realize the good side.
You realize that love can extend beyond universes and even beyond death.
Till next week, sir.
Nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Nanu, nanu.
Mork, what did you do to the toaster?
I'm preparing for that day when you throw me out with  nothin' but a fine-toothed comb.
When you go, you're taking a ski, a slipper, and half a toaster?
Yes, indeed.
Don't you think that I read the papers and watch the TV?
Listen, when I leave, I'm suing you for half of everything you own.
It's called "community property," baby.
It's called the "Marvin Syndrome".
Well, I get half of everything you own, too, you know?
Oh, so big deal.
Half of your Billy Barty poster.
If you just take the top half, I still have a poster.
And I want half of your three bags of sand.
Oh, no.
Now it's alimony.
Please, don't throw me out.
I'll do anything you want.
Okay.
All right.
Hey, look, Mork why were you worried that I was going to ask you to leave?
Did I say something or do something?
I've been reading the s-ss-ss I've been reading the s-ss-ss I looked at the figures on divorce, and the odds are against any couple staying together forever.
Yeah, I know.
I think that's kind of sad.
That's probably because when people first get together, they're just crazy about each other, and then as time wears on, the excitement kind of wears off.
I'm still crazy about you.
And I'm still crazy about you, too.
Good, then we have nothing to fear but sanity itself.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Mindy, promise me that things will always stay exciting for us.
Oh, Mork, I can't because they won't.
But I think of it as getting comfortable, not humdrum.
What a coincidence.
I used to play humdrum in my school band.
I bet you did.
I'll bet you were great on the national anthem.
The Orkan anthem has no music.
It's three minutes of sucking through your teeth.
Yeah, well, you can't dance to ours either.
Hey, listen, do you want to meet me for lunch this afternoon?
Well, no, you see, Mr. Bickley invited me down to the mall to this new Italian restaurant called Della Contessa.
I think that's delicatessen.
Doesn't sound very Italian.
It's owned by my girlfriend Jeanie and her brother.
Bickley took me there and stuck me with lunch.
Hope you didn't have shish kebab.
Ar, ar.
Well, I gotta go to class.
Okay, Mork, I'll tell you what.
I'll do my part to keep this relationship exciting.
Tonight I will make us a romantic little Italian dinner for two.
Well, I'll do my part in trying to keep the it exciting.
Tonight I'll put a bomb in your cannoli.
Snippy.
Inconsiderate.
Ungrateful chowderhead.
Pigheaded, overbearing, ungrateful pea brain.
I knew we shouldn't have moved out here.
What do you mean?
We would have had the same argument in New York.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well, there, I could have given you a little pop.
Here, I get arrested for "violatin' your space".
Remo, remind me when I become a doctor to open up your skull and see what makes ya thick.
Ah.
Enjoy.
May I help you?
Yeah.
I'd like the bacon, lettuce, and tomato, with coleslaw and a cup of coffee, please.
One BLT, one slaw, one java.
Hi.
How may I help you?
May I ask you a question?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Everything's good.
That's not the question.
Um, do all the waitresses and cooks fight like you two?
Only when the waitress has a brother with all the class of a Gong Show reject.
What would you like to eat?
Well, I'd like a squealer on a honky no goyam and a side of John darks.
What?
Oh, it's a ham on white, no mayonnaise, with lots of french fries.
A number 3.
Excuse me.
What are you fighting about?
Okay, look Remo was the last one out last night, and he forgot to lock up this place.
You know, it's like he wants us to get robbed so we'll have to close it and move back to the Bronx.
You live with the Denver Broncos?
Hello, Mork.
Bickley.
Bick, my main grump, what's happening?
Hey, Mr. Bickley, what'll it be today?
Uh, I think I'll have the fried chicken and a bowl of chili, all to go.
I'll get it.
Chirp and a burp.
Hotshot.
Fire one.
Oh, thanks, Bickley, for inviting me out to lunch.
Yeah, I'm a prince.
It seems like that waitress knows you.
Jeanie?
She should.
I've brought a new customer in here every day for lunch since they opened.
I hate to tell you this, they're having a terrible fight.
Oh, yeah?
Great.
I love floor shows.
I thought it's bad to fight with someone you care about.
Nah.
It's a great way to keep a relationship fresh and exciting.
Oh, exciting.
Mindy and I never had a fight.
Really?
My wife and I used to fight like cats and dogs.
She'd throw a plate at me, and I'd call her mother filthy names.
And then she'd slam my lips in a drawer.
Boy, those were the days.
Uh, okay, number three here, and a chirp and burp.
Bick, you think Mindy and I can keep our relationship exciting like you and your wife?
Sure.
The best thing two young kids could do is have a real rousing, knock-down, drag-out fight.
Since you live upstairs from me, make it a quiet one.
Were to.
I was not the last one out last night.
You were.
I was not.
You were.
You were.
Remember you left one of your stupid medical books in the kitchen.
You came back to get it.
What do you mean my medical books are stupid?
You should talk with all the dumb muscle magazines you read.
What dumb muscle magazines?
Those are physical fitness manuals.
Muscle, muscle, muscle.
Don't push me.
'Cause I'll do what you hate.
Oh, Remo, go flex yourself.
Okay, that's it.
Fingernails on the blackboard.
Ah.
Remo.
I don't know why I'm sendi" you through medical school.
I mean, how are you gonna look at a lung if you can't look at a blackboard?
Lungs don't squeak.
Ow.
What happened?
Oh, I cut my finger on that dumb cheese grater.
Oh, come on, you big baby.
It's just a scratch.
What do you mean, a scratch?
That's a gash.
Gashes almost always bleed.
Well, give it a minute.
Remo, look.
Sit down here.
You know, you gotta be more careful with that thing.
Yeah, I know.
I just get in a hurry sometimes.
Why, well, take it easy.
Look, you sit here, have a soda, and I'll finish up with this stuff, okay?
Hey, come here.
Thanks, short stuff.
Anytime.
Ow.
You starin' at me?
Yup.
Yuh.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
You got some sort of problem, buddy?
Yes.
What's your name?
Mork.
Run that by me one more time.
I said Mork, already.
Mork Allreddi?
You Italian?
Astral hatchling.
New York, the east side.
New Ork, dark side.
Hey.
How are ya?
Nanu.
Yeah, na Yeah, nanu?
Well, it's nice to know ya.
It's nice to be known.
Could I ask you something personal?
How personal is it?
It's about your sister.
Forget it, she's a med student.
She'd only be interested in your pancreas.
What I'd like to know is, you two were fighting hard, then you stopped.
Why?
Oh, I cut my finger, and she's a sucker for blood.
Oh, vampire, eh?
Not your type, O. Ar, ar.
Will you keep on fighting?
Well, we're gonna have fights.
But it's a way to get rid of pent-up frustrations.
Oh, so these fights can be valuable?
Sure.
You argue, and then you kiss and you make up.
Whoa-oa-oa.
That sounds great.
Who knows?
If you have a real big fight  Ah.
Mork.
You scared me to death.
Well, I'm glad you're home.
Dinner's almost ready.
Why don't you sit down, and I'll set it up.
There's a little extra spaghetti sauce on the table if you want some more.
And let's get the garlic rolls, and we'll be all set.
You expect me to eat this slop?
What is going on?
You talk about more of the same.
DÃ©jÃ  slop.
What are you doing?
I'm putting your buns in orbit, that's what I'm doing.
What is wrong with you?
I'm tired of eating food that the airlines would turn down.
I've seen cockroaches go, "no way"!
I thought you liked my cooking.
You had a thought?
Ar, ar, ar, ar.
Didn't think there was anything under that barbie-doll hairdo.
Whoa, look: Echo.
Echo.
Echo.
Why don't you shave it all off and get yourself a mohawk?
It would draw attention away from your nose.
My nose.
What's wrong with my nose?
It's shiksa city.
And your feet.
Whoa.
Where do you get your shoes?
Barnum and Bailey?
Ah, ah, ah.
And what's that wonderful fragrance?
Oh, no, Old Spice.
Ship ahoy, ship ahoy Maybe it's Indian leather.
We make a fragrance from the cow that has been dead for four days and lying in the sun.
Oh, Mindy, don't whimper.
It makes you look like a Pekingese with asthma.
It makes your eyes look even closer together.
Okay, it's your turn.
Oh, Mork.
I just can't believe  Boy, this is gonna be great.
Mindy.
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Min.
It was the best fight I've ever seen.
Was it good for you too?
Come on, now, it's time to kiss and make up.
Kiss and make up?
I wouldn't kiss you if you were the only alien on earth.
I think I am.
Well, there's your proof.
So, you don't like my cooking, huh?
Well, if you don't like it, why don't you get off your face and cook something for yourself?
Yeah.
You don't know it's not that easy to be living with a monster from outer space.
Most guys just leave the cap off the toothpaste, right?
You eat it.
Okay, fight's over.
King's X. Fight's over, my foot.
So, you don't like my hairstyle, huh?
Well, Mr. Taste, where'd you get these rags, a fire sale at Disney World?
She didn't mean it.
Oh, and by the way, since we're into honesty, I'd like to inform you that your normal voice sounds like Truman Capote on helium.
I'm Mork from Ork.
Nanu, nanu.
But you can just call me space turkey.
Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar, ar.
Ow.
Ow.
See, I'm I'm cutting myself.
Look, look, no blood.
There will be.
Blood, blood.
Bleed, bleed.
Mork, that's such a shame.
We'll have to have that taken care of.
I'll call the veterinarian.
Mindy, I think I've made a mistake.
You made the mistake?
I made the mistake.
I should have listened to my father.
I never should have let you move in here.
If he told me once, he told me a million times: "Mindy, stick to your own species".
I guess I'll just go up to bed.
Go up to bed, my foot.
There is an egg leaving in 10 minutes.
Be in it.
Mindy.
My lips aren't that long.
Min, Min, Min.
Hey, we're closed.
You gotta help me, please.
It's a matter of life and death.
Look, was there an accident?
If anyone's hurt, I hope it's below the knee 'cause that's all I've studied.
There was no accident, but two people really got hurt.
Look, sit down, and just tell us what happened.
Please.
Well, you know, um I live with a very beautiful, wonderful girl named Mindy.
Min Oh, I know Mindy.
You must be Mork.
Oh, yeah, um, and she's fantastic for me, and we've never had a fight before.
Today I saw you two having a fight.
You said after the fight you kiss and make up.
So I went home and tried it, but things didn't work out.
So she got mad and threw me out of the house.
And you can't kiss through a tiny lock unless you have little, little lips.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You mean, you started a fight, but you weren't mad at her?
You're supposed to be mad?
Whoa.
Oh, no.
It sounded like a wonderful game.
I think I've ruined a wonderful thing.
Maybe you can go talk to her, negotiate.
You'll be Kissinger, I'll be Sadat, she'll be Begin.
Look, don't worry about it.
Let me go and try and talk to Mindy, and see if I can explain things to her.
And why don't you talk to our friend here about apologies?
Hey, uh, it occurs to me that we haven't been formally introdu My name is Remo Da Vinci.
Oh, Leonardo's boy.
Yeah, Leo's my pop.
Look, um Mork When you, like, try and imitate me, you know, you gotta understand something.
Yo, yo, yo.
I'm a complex type of guy.
I operate on a whole bunch of different levels.
Kind of like a surgeon in an elevator.
You see, when my sister and I yell at each other, we're not really mad.
And sometimes when people fight, you know, um They go too far like you did.
And then there's got to be an apology, you know.
So we're gonna make one up for ya.
How do you do that?
There are a couple of different ways you go on this apology thing.
Um Oh, I don't know, you could, uh Oh.
You could you could get her some flowers, or or maybe you could send her some candy.
That'd be all right.
That's no good.
All the stores are closed by now.
There must be some other way.
Well, the best way is to I don't know, just to just to get a really big apology, you know.
You're gonna have to swallow your pride  You take a deep breath  And you just say, "I'm sorry".
I'm sorry.
Look, just say you're sorry, like in your normal way.
Oh.
Go ahead.
Oh, Mindy, I'm sorry.
I'm snake spit, I'm nothing, I'm low.
All right, all right.
I forgive you.
Then we can kiss and make up.
No, don't kiss me.
Mindy, I got to apologize, 'cause the fight you had with Mork was all my fault.
Actually, it was Remo's and my fault.
Actually, it was all Remo's fault.
Come on, Jeanie, how do you figure that?
Remo convinced Mork that fighting was the best way to work out problems.
Mork wasn't even angry.
He wasn't?
You know, all Mork said to me is that he wanted to keep things exciting between you two.
That's it.
Mork said that?
That's what he said.
Oh, brother.
I should've known.
I mean, Mork really isn't capable of losing his temper.
I don't know Mork that well, but right now, he's out there somewhere trying to figure out how to apologize.
Mindy and I had our first fight.
Congratulations.
No, it was horrible.
I did the things like you said.
I called her awful stuff, she called me terrible stuff, then she locked me out.
Sounds like a reasonable first fight to me.
Has a good beat, easy to yell to.
I give it a 7.
But I need your help, Bick.
You see, y-you know more about fighting than anyone I know.
How did you and your wife get to kiss and make up?
We never did.
Is that the way you're supposed to end an argument?
It is, but ours never ended.
It started the day we got married, and went on for 15 solid years without a letup.
Oh, then what happened?
One day, she threw me out of the house, locked the door, and I never saw her again.
Maybe you could help me write an apology of some sort.
Apologize?
That's the worst thing you can do.
It's like admitting you were wrong.
But I was wrong.
Well, all the more reason to lie.
All right.
Let me write that down.
Look, it depends on the situation.
Once I missed our anniversary dinner.
I told my wife I forgot.
But in a really tough spot, I always rely on natural disasters.
Disasters.
Late for a meeting, freak thunderstorm.
Don't wanna go to your mother-in-law's house, avalanche.
If that doesn't work, can I get a card?
Maybe that'll help too.
All right, if you think it'll do you any good.
I think I've got a Here.
Here's an apology card for you.
Aw, thanks, Bick.
I bet I know who that is.
I bet I do too.
Now, Mindy, you give this guy a chance to apologize, 'cause it's the only thing that's gonna make him feel any better about this.
's okay?
's okay.
's all right?
's all right.
Okay, open the door.
Jeanie, thanks.
You're welcome.
Mork, Jeanie and I  Where am I?
Where am I?
What have I done?
Who am I?
Mork Thank you.
Who are you?
Mindy.
That's who you are.
Mindy.
And you wouldn't believe this, Mindy, I've had amnesia for the last 24 hours.
And I hope I haven't said or done anything real stupid.
You've had what?
Oh, no.
It's catching.
You poor little thing.
Mork.
I don't have amnesia, and you don't have amnesia.
Well, not now.
It's a miracle.
It's a miracle.
I'm free.
You saved me.
You touched me, and I'm born again.
I'm not buying it.
You're not buying it?
No.
All right, the reason I I said all those awful things was, well There was a tidal wave.
It picked me up.
It just grabbed me.
I was in the middle of this great big wa  it was really mellow.
'cause I caught the wave.
There I was about to be tubed, and I said, "wow.
I'm there".
And I'm goin' down the side of this huge wave, and I said, "wow.
Denver or bust".
You know?
It's gonna be incredible.
That's amazing, Mork, because the nearest ocean is over a thousand miles away.
A thousand miles away.
A long way.
Well, the real reason I said those things is, you know, it's a full moon.
Look what happened.
See?
Already it's taking effect.
And I-I'm a weremork.
I hate to tell you that, Mindy.
I believe this one, Mork.
Tidal waves, full moons, and you're a weremork.
You believe it?
Then let's kiss and make up.
Mork, come on.
Now, I thought our friendship was built on honesty.
Don't you feel bad for making up these stupid stories?
Yeah, I guess I should buy a house in San Clemente.
Mork, if you're trying to apologize to me, why don't you just say what you feel in your heart?
And if you do, I just might accept, and, uh, maybe we can kiss and make up.
Really?
Because I've got a lot of ways to apologize.
Here they are.
Oh-oh.
What's this?
It's my "bag," you know?
I got you these chocolate kisses.
Be careful though, they leave little brown hickeys.
That's all right, Mork.
I accept your apology.
Wait, I still have some more ways to apologize.
Here's a card that Mr. Bickley wrote me.
"Hearing you were sickly, sailor, made my timbers shiver.
Hope you're getting over cirrhosis of the liver".
Mork, that isn't an apology card.
Well, I saved the best for last.
I really misunderstood about fighting.
And I didn't know those things I was saying would be so awful, and I never meant them.
I'll never, ever say them again as as long as I'm here.
Will you forgive me?
I forgive you, Mork.
Now, have we gone through all the possible apologies?
The four possible ways to apologize on earth, but then there are the 83 Orkan methods.
Mork, I forgive you.
Oh, no.
I have to suck my teeth through 10 choruses of the Orkan national anthem.
Then I beat myself with a canary, then we go to Las Vegas, I pretend my right arm is longer than left.
Mork I forgive you.
Then we have to Don't press your luck.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Yo, great cosmic pachyderm.
I'm glad you called, Mork.
The committee would like you to study something on earth called the "nuclear family".
Sir, are those the ones who have all the bombs?
No.
I'm talking about a mother, a father, a sister, and a brother.
Well, sir, I'm halfway there.
I met a sister and a brother, and they own a food factory called a "delicatessen".
What do they manufacture?
Oh, a wonderful thing called "sandwiches," sir.
I'm sending you today's special in the express egg.
It's a pastrami on rye with mayo.
Thank you, Mork.
Sir.
Now, what happened with this family you met?
Well, sir, I understand why you call them nuclear, because as soon as I met them, they blew up.
It must have been exceedingly messy.
Oh, it was, sir.
It caused a chain reaction, then Mindy and I had a fight.
Did you explode?
No, sir, the both of us got hurt.
See, what happened is, sir, I pretended to be mad, but then she really got mad.
Did she knock the stuffing out of you?
No, sir, you see it wasn't a physical fight.
Here on earth, sometimes people throw words instead of punches, and it can be much more painful.
That's why it's easier for a broken arm to mend than it is for a broken heart.
This is Mork signing off until next week, sir.
Nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Nanu, nanu.
Hey, you know, Jeanie, I was thinking, uh, this deli would do a little more business if you had some kind of promotion.
Maybe you could give away gasoline with every sandwich.
Ha!
They already get gas with the chili.
No, no, no.
I mean, something that would be like a reward to, uh, your few loyal customers.
Say, a discount on the food.
Oh, Mr. Bickley thinks we should give him a discount.
Yeah, say, Oh.
You got it.
Maurice, keep the engine running.
Here's $100.
Buy yourself a cigar.
Here's $200.
Buy yourself a haircut.
Love you.
Hey, what's going on here?
Hey, Bick, here's $20 for that card I bought from you last Christmas.
Love you, darling.
What is this?
It's Monopoly money.
I know.
I don't want to pay you with that useless U.S. currency.
Wow.
How'd you get to be so rich?
Well, it's a long story.
I'll make it real short.
I played Mindy in Monopoly last night, and I beat the chance off her.
I cleaned out her community chest.
Always inspiring to see a good winner.
Gosh.
What are you gonna do with all your money?
Maybe invest it.
I don't want people to know that I'm loaded.
I had the same problem.
Remo, do you have any place where I can hide this?
Oh, I've got the perfect place.
Where I hide all my valuable potato peels and coffee grounds.
Oh, excuse me, Daddy Warbucks.
I have a customer.
Here you go.
Well, now that I've got all this money, I don't know whether I should build a tax shelter, you know?
I bought this book by Bert Lance: Having Fun With Other People's Money.
With all this scratch, I've been itching to go to Crab Nebula.
Well, I hope you have fun.
Well, who knows.
You know, I've all those hotels, I built all those houses, but it's all so plastic.
I don't know whether to invest in maybe, uh, public utilities or buy a railroad.
What do you think?
If you really want to know what to do with all that money, why don't you pay for my dinner?
La-la-la  Ahem.
Ahem.
A A hem and a sleeve.
What's wrong?
I mean, the service is slow, but don't let it bum you out.
It's not just the service.
It's It's my whole life.
I'm a horrible failure.
Well, maybe I can make you a better failure.
Well, thanks, but there's no hope for me.
I came to Boulder to become a star.
I wanted to sing and And to dance and to make movies.
You came to Boulder to become a star?
Now I'm here.
I'm all alone.
Got no money.
Got no friends.
Hey, if you want a sugar daddy, I'm hypoglycemic.
Hey, listen, I've got more money than J. Paul Getty put together.
Hey, I'll be your friend.
Really?
That's wonderful.
Could we start right away?
Hey, even sooner.
Oh, great.
Maybe you could come over to dinner at my house, say, like, around 7-ish?
How about now-ish?
Oh, that's great-ish.
Hey, Mork.
You want your 5 grand back?
No, keep it.
It's just paper.
Ooh.
No, better than that.
Throw it away.
It's wrinkled.
The other day I bought a huge car and said, "Throw it in the river.
I want to see it sink".
Mm, that was a wonderful meal, Kathy.
I love a good pork butt.
Well, thanks for the chow, and ciao.
Oh, no, you can't go yet.
Um, I've hardly gotten to know you.
Why don't you come over here on the couch?
Oh, dokey-okey.
Whoa!
Hup-ho!
Five-point-0.
You know, Mork, my heart really went out to you when I heard about your burden of having too much money.
You know, it made my problem seem so small.
Having no money.
Oh, thank you.
Mm, nice wine.
Oh, and a good week too.
Well, you know, a dollar doesn't go as far as it used to.
Probably can't afford the gas.
Wah!
You have a very kind face.
Oh, and you have kind of a face too.
Hoo-hoo!
And your hair, ooh, it's so soft.
That's because I gargle with lanolin.
Would you like to dance?
Oh, I'd love to.
Adorable, Oh.
Uh, why don't you put your arms around me?
Oh, sure thing, Kimosabette.
See?
I never even touched you.
You know, I can also stand on my lips.
That's That's swell.
Oh, you know, I'm getting so tired.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Ah.
Maybe you should go to bed, then.
But I'd be so lonely.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Mork, think about it.
I mean, I'm a woman, you're a man.
Right.
Oh.
And this is a dove.
And here's a chicken.
And this is a little lizard.
Boy, this is getting fun.
Your turn.
Well, I know something that's a lot more fun, okay?
Why don't you take off your suspenders.
All right.
Hey, that's no fun.
I do that every night.
Oh!
Oh, it's getting so hot in here!
Well, you know, when I get hot, I like to sit on a good cold Fudgsicle.
Doesn't everyone?
Mork, I want you to spend the night here.
Why?
: Because I'm all alone.
I need somebody here.
: All right, I'll do it.
But do you have an attic?
: I don't have an attic.
: All right.
I'll rough it here, right on Mr. Couch.
But what about my Mr. Bed?
I don't think there's room for the couch.
Well Besides, where would you sleep?
Fine.
Fine, fine.
But you know where I am should you need me.
I'll just whistle.
Well, thanks a lot, Jeanie.
If you see him, will you tell him to call me?
Yeah, I I won't.
Okay, thanks.
Bye-bye.
Mork, it's you!
You're right!
Johnny Olson, tell her what she's won!
Thanks, Carl.
She's just won a Naugahyde wig.
Yes, Naugahyde, the wig of the champions.
Well, where have you been?
What have you been doing?
Nothing.
Nothing?
You were gone all night.
Well, I met a lonely actress.
And?
Well, she asked me over for dinner.
Did you go?
Sure.
I was hungry.
So, what happened after dinner?
Nothing.
We just sat on the couch, that's all.
That's all?
Oh, pretty much, yeah.
There was a little dancing and then, uh, I put my arms around her.
Oh, you did, did you?
Yeah.
And then I took off my suspenders, and she got a little overheated.
She took off her top, and then, boom, she wanted to go to bed.
Well?
Nothing.
I just spent the night with her, that's all.
Bye-bye.
Mindy, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Good.
Entre nous.
Kathy.
: Mork.
You know, I'm a little disappointed.
I thought you were gonna be my friend.
One evening, and I don't see you for two weeks?
Well, I I thought you only needed a friend for one night.
You're forgiven.
You know, somehow I imagined your place would be, well, more expensive-looking.
Well, it's not mine.
It belongs to the girl I live with.
A girl, huh?
And does this girl know about the night you spent with me?
Oh, yes, I told Mindy all about it.
Good.
Very good.
You know, Mork, I've been thinking about you a lot these past two weeks, and that night we spent together had a lot of meaning for me.
What did it mean to you?
Mm, let's see Pork butt.
Good dancing, lumpy sofa.
Are you trying to say you love me?
I don't think so.
Okay, Mork, ahem, I wasn't gonna bring this up, but you have torn it out of me.
Will you marry me?
: This is so sudden!
Hi.
Well, who's this?
Remember I told you about that girl I spent the night with, the one with the bad thermostat?
Mindy, this is Kathy.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, Mork and I were just talking about getting married.
Ah-ha-ha!
You were?
No, she were.
Uh, Kathy, um, I don't think you understand.
You see, uh, Mork and I have been living together for quite some time now, and Mork sometimes doesn't grasp the complexities of personal relationships.
Now, I'm sure you're a very nice girl, but somewhere along the way, I think you've gotten your wires crossed.
Mindy, dear, I don't think you understand.
I'm having Mork's baby.
La-la-la  Well, I hope you're at least gonna do the right thing by me.
I mean, it's gonna take a lot of money to raise our child properly after we're married.
Married?
Oh, if I marry her, can I still keep living with you?
Thanks for the offer, Mork, but I think I'll pass.
Well, I'd like to still keep living with Mindy.
Would you take money instead?
What a cruel thing to say.
But then, life is cruel, isn't it?
Okay.
Great.
Here's 15 bucks.
Oh, that's funny.
Yeah, that's very, very funny.
Well, you listen, buster, you're gonna have a paternity suit on your hands if I don't get $5,000 in 24 hours.
Oh, listen, I'm no legal bozo.
How about a compromise?
Five thousand hours to give you $24.
This guy's hysterical.
Well, before you start talking about lawsuits, you'd better be able to prove that he's the father.
Oh, well, even if I can't prove it, I can make his life miserable in court, and I guarantee it won't seem so funny when his name is plastered all over the newspapers.
Oh, Mork, what have you done?
Well, I guess I know what you've done, but Well, Mindy, what am I gonna do?
Well, Mork, to tell you the truth, I don't think I'm the one to advise you at this time.
Somehow, I just find it a little difficult to be objective.
Oh, I don't want to marry somebody that's not Mindy.
Come on.
It'll help promote business.
Remo Please, just Just try on the sarong.
If it worked for Lamour, it'll work for la less.
Remo, the flower, yes.
The sarong, never.
It's not like it's topless.
Ha!
It's just tasteless.
But then, how can you discuss taste with a man who looks like he walked out of a Don Ho nightmare?
You say anything, and you're the daily special.
Mork!
Hawaii!
A little depressed.
Whoa, Remo, what happened?
Did Picasso throw up on you?
Thanks, it's great to see you too.
What's the matter with you?
Well, I'm thinking of getting married.
Oh.
Well, you got troubles.
Sit down.
And you're lucky.
Today I'm dressed like a Hawaiian psychiatrist.
All right, what's the deal?
Well, I I I'm thinking of getting married.
Well, I'm excited for you.
In fact, I think it's terrific, and I know Mindy's real happy too, huh?
I don't think she likes the girl too much.
Wha?
What girl?
Well, the one that's having my baby.
How did that happen?
Well, it was an accident.
I wish you could get coverage for that type of collision.
Yeah, but let's be hypothetical for a moment.
What would happen if, uh, Jeanie, you know, um?
You know, uh?
You know, got in trouble?
I'd kill the guy!
Okay.
I'd kill him, and I'd force him to marry her.
Feel like I'm wearing a doggy bag from a luau.
Jeanie, will?
Will you cover yourself up?
And stay away from him.
Well, gladly, and why?
Well, um, he got a girl, uh Fat.
No.
In the family way.
Yeah, I think she wants to get married.
I can't believe this.
But if you did it, marrying her is the honorable thing to do.
Of course, it's your decision, Mork.
Yeah, I do want to do the honorable thing.
I guess I'd better marry her tonight.
Better start making some phone calls.
I guess you have a lot of plans to make, huh?
Right.
You're darn tooting.
The first thing I want to do is find out her last name.
Can you imagine?
Mr. and Mrs.     Yoo-hoo!
It's me, lumpy boy.
Well, I'm glad you agreed to settle things right away.
Now, where's the money?
Money?
What money?
We're getting married.
Getting married?
But on the phone, you said that That That you were gonna take care of everything.
Well, I am, little uzzy-wuzzums.
I'm also gonna take care of our little bundle de joie.
There is no little There is no reason for us to get married.
With your money, I can take care of the fuzzy bundle all by myself.
I wouldn't think of it, sugar lumps.
Don't call me that.
Why not?
I mean, pretty soon we're gonna be husband and wife and you're gonna be my little boojums and I'm gonna be your Uncle Squeezers.
Listen, I don't think you really understand quite what's going on here.
Mork Mm-hm?
I'm not good enough for you.
Oh Oh, I mean, you can't throw away your whole life just because you made one little mistake.
But after we're married, I can sleep on the couch again, and we'll have lots of little mistakes.
Reconsider.
Reconsider.
No, I Oh, you sly boots.
You're more anxious than I am.
You're already ready to go on the honeymoon.
Turlock, here we come.
Wait a minute.
This isn't going right at all.
Who's that?
Either the pope or a justice of the peace.
I'll get it.
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
The bus doesn't stop at this corner.
Hello, I'm Mork.
I'm Justice Aaron Abbott.
You know, I found him at the beginning of the telephone book.
He's the top of his field.
And this is?
Oh, Kathy, my lovely bride-to-be.
I didn't catch your last name yet.
Cumberland.
Oh, like the gap.
Boy, I hope Mindy gets that note I left.
I wouldn't want her to miss this.
Mork.
Mork, you don't even know what I'm like.
I mean, I have these rotten, filthy, awful habits.
I I drool in my sleep.
That's all right.
I'll wear rubber pajamas.
Okay, I didn't want to lay this on you, but I run around with men.
Uh-oh.
Shouldn't jog when you're preggers.
Who's that?
Could be the pope now.
I'll get it.
Ah, friends of the bride or the groom?
Uh Uh, the groom.
Yeah.
Uh, can I talk to you for a minute, Mork?
I know that you think you know what you're doing, but I know you don't really know what you think that you know.
Uh, you tell him.
Mork, can you?
Can you take a little constructive criticism?
Sure.
This is the stupidest thing you've ever done.
Oh, I guess that means you're not bringing a wedding present.
Mork, Mork, Mork, you don't owe that bimbo anything.
You have your whole life ahead of you.
You're a young man.
You've got your health.
You have your friends.
Your brains are a little shaky.
But it's the honorable thing to do.
That's another strike against you.
You tell him.
Mork I am really gonna miss you.
Oh, Mind, I hate to do this, but it's my duty.
Oh, Mork.
Eh Excuse me, can we get started?
Oh.
Sure thing.
Oh, no.
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I've been thinking.
Maybe we could raise the kid for $4,000.
He doesn't have to go to college.
I wouldn't think of it.
Come on.
Twenty-five hundred.
He doesn't have to go to high school.
I want to do the right thing.
A thousand dollars!
That's my final offer.
Eternal bliss and marriage to me forever.
That's my final offer.
Mork, you could ruin the rest of your life.
Well, what about the rest of my life?
Could we?
Dearly beloved I do.
Not yet.
I don't.
Okay.
: Five hundred, and you'll never hear from me again.
: Sounds like a good deal to me.
No, I buttered my bread, and now I'm gonna lie in it.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered Oh, this is ridic : Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to witness the union of this man and this woman.
We have come to join them in the bonds of holy matrimony Oh, nothing kinky yet, please.
If there's anyone here who would object to this marriage, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.
I object.
I object.
I object.
That's three.
Fifty dollars, bus fare, and I'm gone.
But gungabooby, I would if I could, but I haven't got $50.
It's all in stocks?
No, it's in pants.
It's in my pocket.
Fifteen big ones.
You're not rich?
Eh.
You mean I wasted all this time, and you're not even rich?
Now I object.
Maybe I can still catch the 8:15 bus.
Better have that taken care of.
Somebody might trip.
Whoa!
Well, I'll finish the ceremony.
Do you promise to love, honor, and obey till one of us bites the big one?
Will you stop it?
He never even laid a hand on me.
Don't they call this "extortion"?
Eh.
You were extorting my baby?
What a horrible way of saying you You love me.
No, Mork, there is no baby.
There never was.
Shock, bewilderment, confusion.
Why did you want to marry me?
I think we'll let her explain that to the police.
Come on.
You're not getting away with this one this time, Miss Honey Lumps.
Oh, uh, you know, you are a very attractive man.
Would you like to get a bite to eat?
Are you buying?
I know this place where I can get a 10-percent discount.
Oh, Min, just when I think I understand you Earthlings, some weirdness comes along and, zammo.
Oh, Mork.
The problem is you're a magnet for weird.
That woman thought you were rich, and she was out to get your money.
She never thought you were gonna marry her.
But wouldn't any human being do that?
No.
See, that's one of the other reasons you have so much trouble.
You're just not fully human yet.
That's also one of the reasons I think you're so special.
I think you're special.
I guess I guess that means that you're not fully human yet either.
Well, thanks.
Oh, it's too bad about Kathy.
I had this incredible honeymoon planned.
Now we can't go on it.
Maybe you'd like to go.
Well, maybe I would.
Where were you gonna go?
Well, we were gonna go to Three Mile Island.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Here I am, Mork.
What's been going on?
Well, this week, sir, I learned that on Earth, things aren't always what they appear to be.
You'll have to explain that.
I will, sir.
For example, the ocean appears to be clean, new cars appear to be well-built, and Ronald Reagan appears to have brown hair.
That's very complicated.
Well, it gets worse, sir.
There's double deceptions, like the government appears to be disorganized, and it is.
What does all this have to do with your week?
I was about to tell you, your testiness.
I met a woman who wasn't what she appeared to be.
Who was that lady?
: That was no lady.
That was almost my wife.
: On Earth, some humans believe that they should be married before they get pregnant.
Why is that so important?
Well, I don't know.
It must be too expensive to take the children along on the honeymoon.
Well, I'm proud of you for trying to do the right thing in spite of the consequences, Mork.
Thank you, sir.
I I believe that I should take responsibility for the things that I do.
Main problem is I can't figure out whether I did them or not.
Ar-ar-ar-ar.
Well, until next week, nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Nanu, nanu!
Mindy: I don't think it was such a bad idea for a promotion "A night in Acapulco".
Okay, okay, so I blew it, but I gotta figure out a way to get some customers in this place.
Okay, guinea pig, could you flex your tendon?
I thought you'd never ask.
What are you doing?
Don't put your feet on the table.
I gotta serve food here.
I am studying to be a doctor.
Comprende?
Yeah, I know.
You got a perfect patient here Your brother's business is dying.
All right, everybody, mellow out!
It's officer mork here, of the "Right on" police.
You know, I've been really picking up some bad vibes on my vibrational meter, and I'm not gonna bust you because that's really a downer, okay?
I'm gonna put you under gestalt arrest.
It's a thing, where Hey, I've got some handcuffs.
If you don't wanna wear them, you don't have to.
If you want to, I'll fasten them real tight What is all this?
What, you didn't know?
Mork got a new job.
He's the night watchman at the science exhibition.
Heh, that should set science back about 200 years.
Whoa.
Nice-looking gams, sweetheart.
Gams?
Pens, stems, pipes.
So, Mork-O, have a seat here.
Remo.
Sounds like you found a job you really like.
I'm proud of ya.
I can keep it as long as I do the two things I'm supposed to.
One thing is to make my rounds, the other is to keep my hands off the science exhibits.
How's it going?
Well, one out of two ain't bad.
Uh-oh.
All right, spill it.
Well, there's this really cute old robot there, and I've I've reprogrammed him to play games and talk.
He always wins, but it's better than playing mumbletypeg with a laser.
Mork, you know you probably shouldn't be fooling around with the science exhibits.
Well, no one really cares about him, except for me.
Hold it a minute.
Telling me you've reprogrammed some sort of robot.
Are you kidding?
It's really simple.
All you have to do is adjust the circuitry to accommodate new diodes, and, probably, if it's at night, it's a nocturnal emission, which is kind of embarrassing for a robot.
And besides that, The real tricky part is synchronizing your polarity with your binder encronometers.
If you do that, You either get a robot that talks, or a Cuisinart.
I knew that.
Well, I I guess I'm off.
Remo, Huh?
How did that "Night in Acapulco" go?
Oh, not too good.
No one thought it looked like authentic Mexico in here.
Well, that's easy, all you have to do is bust people as they leave.
Ciao!
See ya.
I see you $2 million, and raise you the moon.
: Too rich for my hydraulic system.
I win the known universe with a pair of 2s.
What did you have?
Let's see here.
Whoa!
Four aces.
Couldn't have won with that, anyway.
How did you know I was bluffing?
Actually, I could see your cards in your dome.
Shazbat!
Well, I can't teach you everything, Chuckela.
Mork, could we talk for a moment, in private?
Private's locked.
Lab rats are drugged.
What's up, Chuck?
I want to thank you for programming me for consciousness.
Aw, it's no big deal.
I was kinda lonely.
I needed someone to talk to.
Something very strange has happened.
Yesterday, after you left, I experienced a condition which seemed to dictate the necessity of your presence.
Chuck you missed me.
Missed you?
But that's impossible.
Robots function purely by logic.
I have no emotions.
Well, you've got them now.
I didn't mean to give them to you, but I guess that comes with having a conscience.
Well, I shouldn't have emotions.
They conflict with my computer banks.
I used to think the same way, Chuck, but now I'm up to my ears in 'em.
You've probably got a few of them swimming inside.
They're just itching to get out.
Cootchy, cootchy, cootchy.
Maybe that is what caused the other strange thing.
When you came in last night, you smiled at the newer robot, and I wanted to scratch out his cathodes.
Chuck, you were jealous.
These emotions have names?
Yes, and I know them all personally.
Is it good to be jealous?
Well, It's good to have emotions, but jealousy's not one of the better ones.
Why are you jealous of XLG-15?
Because he is shiny and new, and technologically perfect, and I am going to be dismantled next week.
Why, Chuck-O?
Metal fatigue.
They say rusty old robots like me should be destroyed.
Who are they?
They're not gods.
Just because they created you, doesn't give them the right to do that.
Mork, calm down.
Everyone is only here temporarily.
Even that brand-new, shiny robot will wear out someday.
But the only thing that's tough, is I've I've just found out I'm going to be dismantled, and I've just found out what it is to be alive.
Chuck, how can you take it so calmly?
They must know what they are doing.
They feel I should be taken apart, before I fall apart.
The only flaw in their logic is, I am not falling apart!
What was that, Chuck?
Nothing.
My stomach was rumbling.
Let's change the subject.
Anything you say.
Yes.
All right, uh, let's play another game.
We've played poker, let's see.
We'll play, um, "I spy".
You be Robert Culp, I'll be Bill Cosby, all right?
Sure!
I spy with my little eye, something beginning with the letter "a".
Whoa, great impression of Linda Blair.
Acetylene torch.
Hot, but no way.
These emotions are interesting.
I'd like to experience more of them.
Adhesive tape!
Sticky, but no banana.
You'll never get emotions if you're cramped up in this tiny, cooped up space all the time.
Well, I guess if you're not gonna guess it, then I'll have to tell you.
It was air.
Oh!
But it's supposed to be something you can see.
You can't see air.
Ah, then you've never been to Los Angeles.
All right, you win.
Okay.
I spy with my little eye, something beginning with "f".
"F".
Floor!
No.
Ah.
Oh, I wish I could get out of here, so I could experience some more emotions.
Mmm!
I want to live!
I want to dance!
I want to shake my booty!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Mork!
What are you doing home so early?
It's not early.
It's 5:00 in the morning.
Oh.
Oh, I must have fallen asleep, while watching that movie.
What were you watching?
Oh, I don't know.
Some old tear-jerker.
My favorite love story is "Mothra vs.
Godzilla".
I always cry when Tokyo gets destroyed.
Same old story, though.
Boy meets city, boy loses city.
Tiny girls sing Mothra Well, how was work?
Oh.
Well, remember that old robot called Chuck, I was telling you about?
They named the robot Chuck?
Well, no one calls him "Chas".
Remember I programmed him to play games and talk?
Well, now he's accidentally got feelings.
I didn't think robots had feelings.
I didn't think Orkans did, but Now he's got them, he wants to experience everything.
Well, maybe you could fix him up with Mr. Bickley's dishwasher.
Now he's not a machine, anymore.
He's a being.
He wants to meet people.
He wants to party hearty.
I don't know what you're getting yourself into, but this whole thing sounds pretty strange to me.
Have you ever heard the story of Frankenstein?
Oh, yeah, it's an incredible love story.
Mork, besides being a love story, what it was about, was if you tamper with a monster, then Chuck's not a monster!
He's no Robert Redford, but The point is, Mork Is that Frankenstein was given feelings, and he didn't know how to handle them, and he got himself into a lot of trouble.
So you're implying that Chuck is going to strangle innocent townspeople?
What I'm saying is that it might end up hurting itself, or maybe somebody else, and it might end up costing you your job.
Listen.
I know a lot about Chuck.
He's my best friend.
I know him very, very well, and He hasn't got a vicious circuit in his body.
He wouldn't harm anything.
It's for you.
Mindy, this is Chuck the robot.
Yeah, that would have been my guess.
Greetings, Mindy.
I am sorry about the door.
Oh, well, it's my fault.
I never should leave it closed.
It's all right, Chuck-O.
We'll just put a two-foot peephole in.
Perfect for 600-pound Avon ladies.
: Wanna buy some makeup?
So, this is a home.
No, this is an apartment.
A home is where he belongs.
Come on in, Chuck.
Take a load off your hinges.
There we go.
Oh, dear.
Ohh.
Uh, Mork, I think that your friend, uh, Chuck, should go back to the science fair.
Come on, Mindy.
Let him stay.
He's a friend.
He needs a place to stay.
Please, please, Mindy.
Oh, gee, Mork.
I don't know.
No way!
But maybe we all could get together, and have lunch sometime.
You act like you're afraid of Chuck.
: Oh, no.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Come here, don't be afraid.
Come here, touch him.
Listen, this couldn't harm you.
Watch.
Chuck, kill!
See, he didn't do anything.
Lassie would have been at your throat by now.
Chuck, say hello.
Hello, Mindy.
You're very pretty.
Oh.
Well, thank you.
And you're very metallic.
Thank you.
Oh, please, let me stay.
I I was kidding myself before, Mork.
I am rusting away.
There's not going to be anything wrong with you, there's nothing wrong with you.
With the time I have left, I want to find out what life is all about.
I I need to be with warm, caring people.
Yeah.
Chuck and I, We're We're real, real good buddies.
You bet!
See?
He likes me.
No, no, Chuck.
That's all right.
I'll get up.
Mork, he has to go back before he's missed.
Well, the exhibit doesn't open until next Monday.
No one's going to miss me over the weekend.
Except maybe the Coke machine, but she's only nice for money.
Mindy, please let him stay.
He'll be the perfect houseguest.
He doesn't eat, doesn't sleep, doesn't smell after three days.
And he only uses the bathroom to change his oil.
Oh, that's a good one, Mork.
Oh, Mindy, isn't he a fantastic audience?
Uh, yeah.
Just like having Vegas in your own home.
Oh, Mindy, how can I thank you for letting me stay here?
Oh, any way you want, as long as it's from over there.
'Scuse me, Mork.
Mindy, please.
Let's make Chuck feel at home.
Tell you what.
You go fluff up the toolbox, and I'll make some STP daquiri.
Mary had a little Bel, il, uh, schnuzz, ughhh.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, he said, "Mary had a little Bel, shnoot, ugh".
Aren't you into literature?
That's the poetry of Billy Carter.
I'm sorry.
My brain seems to wander once in a while.
I'm not as young as I used to be.
In 1492, Columbus invented the cotton gin.
He is in bad shape.
Well, he's not well, but he'll get better.
I promise.
He will.
Well, how long has this been happening?
Uh, how long has what been happening?
See?
I'm well enough, Mork, for someone whose time has almost come.
Oh, don't talk like that, Chuck.
You're still vital.
You're the original man of steel.
On the outside, maybe, but inside, I have metal fatigue.
Even Geritol with iron will not help.
Is there anything that we can do to help?
Oh, I want to find out what life is all about.
I have feelings, and I want to use them.
Abraham Lincoln was the 16th president, and the inventor of the Continental.
I never thought I'd be feeling sorry for a robot.
Oh, please, don't feel sorry for me.
Just help me make what time I have left meaningful.
Ohhh, I want to feel useful.
There must be something a robot can do, besides just being another exhibit at a science fair.
Mindy, you may have just licked that problem with that cute little tongue of yours.
How would you like to be the main attraction at a delicatessen?
Will I learn more about feelings there?
No, you'll learn about the most intense emotion of them all.
You mean love?
No, heartburn.
Step right up!
I want you to see the scientific wonder of the century.
Chuck the robot's gonna be here in a minute.
This is great.
Getting a robot to lure in these people.
Mork, you're a genius!
Oh, you're too modest.
And somebody thought this was the dumbest idea he'd ever heard.
Look, it's no disgrace to be a septic, okay?
Skeptic.
Tanks.
How was I supposed to know the robot could talk?
Oh, well Remo, anything's possible!
You learned.
Heh, heh.
You know what it means, when I put my thumb in my teeth like this, huh?
Yes, that you're too short to reach your nose.
Oh, that's a good one.
You're learning from me.
You're learning from me.
Come on.
All right, already.
We'd better bring him out, now.
They seem to be getting a little restless, and full.
May I have your attention, ladies and gentlemen.
We are about to bring out Chuck the robot.
But first, how about a A piece of this delicious strawberry cheesecake?
We're going to can the commercial break, that lady's doing a nasty thing to the salami, making a weapon.
Hey, Chuck-O!
Get ready, baby!
Here he comes, here he comes!
Ahhh, so, this is what life is all about.
Chuck, my main machine, slam me some tin, baby!
Whoa!
Heavy metal!
Ladies and gentlemen, let me present Chuck the robot!
He's gonna answer any of your questions, and solve any of your problems.
So, where's the restroom?
That is not my problem.
They laughed.
They must like me.
Are you kidding?
You're killin' them.
I can see Variety tomorrow.
"Garners big yuks.
Arranged to gather for confab.
Five big deals".
Thank you all for coming especially the fat lady.
What?
That's a little bit intense, Chuck-O.
You're being a little too realistic, there.
But I I I don't know why I said that.
Look, uh, Chuck, I think, maybe, that you better go and apologize, okay?
Oh, yes.
You're right.
Lady, I am sorry you are fat.
Mork, Mork, I did it again!
That's it, I'm leavin'!
Wait, wait.
And don't look too close for the tip!
How about some cheesecake?
I thought you said this was gonna help business.
What's wrong, Chuck?
I don't know.
Hi, Mr. Robot!
Hello, little girl.
How are you today?
Fine, thanks.
How much is three and four?
Nine.
Nine.
It is nine.
See, mommy, I was right.
He He's wrong.
The robot was wrong!
Can it, baldy.
Ahh!
Oh!
Help me!
Help!
I am having an emotional brownout.
What's wrong with him?
Oh, nothing.
He'll be all right.
Come on, Chuck.
Let's go.
We gotta get out of here.
No, he can't go!
Mork, something terrible is happening to me!
I've got to go!
Now!
Now!
"E" equals H2O.
No, don't do that!
Water equals MC squared.
I-s-s-ugh!
I-s-s-ugh!
I-s-s-ugh!
Oxygen!
Oxygen!
Shut up!
There's nothin' wrong with him!
He's gonna be all right.
All right, come on.
Mork, we'd better hurry.
It's all right, Mindy.
No one comes in here till Monday, anyway.
: I'm sorry, Gwendolyn.
Foxholes are for fighting.
Poor Chuck.
His circuits are really going fast.
Well, it's nothing that can't be fixed.
: Get those birds outta here!
Easy, old fella.
Easy.
It's gonna be all right.
Who Who is it?
Who's Who's talking to me?
It's your old buddy, Mork-O.
I'm here too, Chuck.
Remember me?
Mindy?
You rested your head on my bed, while Mork sponged you off with Rust-Oleum.
I remember.
Hey, hang in there, old buddy.
You're home now.
Ohh.
Home.
Oh, yes.
That's the best place to die.
Hey, you don't talk like that.
Ohh.
Your hands.
They're warm.
Reload the muskets!
Drive back those zulus, in the name of the queen!
Uh why is he shouting?
Maybe I can pull his transistors.
That way I can give him a temporary jerry-rig.
I can recharge him, maybe.
Mork.
Mork, what you want to do is good, but you're only postponing the inevitable.
But I gotta do something, I don't wanna see him die like this.
But Mork, he's suffering.
You're only going to prolong it.
I Yeah, but he I think you should let him go for both your sakes.
Yeah, but it's not right, Mindy.
That's not for you to decide.
Yeah, but I gotta do something.
I don't want to see him spend his last few moments like this.
Please.
Can we have a few moments, please?
Sure.
Chuck?
: Present.
How are you feeling?
Afraid.
You You're gonna be all right after I finish doing this.
What Don't No What are you doing?
I was just gonna pull some of your circuits, so you'll go back to the way you were, so you won't feel what you're feeling.
No.
No, leave me Leave me the way I am.
But I've got to, Chuck.
That way you won't feel the fear anymore.
I wanted to be human.
Fear Fear comes with the territory.
I'll have the lasagna.
It's my fault, Chuck.
You were just a machine, before I got ahold of you.
I want to turn you back to the way you were.
Oh, then we couldn't have been close.
Oh you You let me feel life, Mork.
Please let me feel the end of it, huh?
Yeah, but I don't wanna see Ring around the rosey Pock Chuck-O, I don't wanna see you suffer like this.
All my life, I never had a choice.
You gave me the ability to make one, and my choice is to die with dignity.
Yeah, but you don't make it very easy for me.
Mork, you know what?
We never finished our "I spy" game.
We were on "f".
I don't think I can play.
Please.
Oh, please.
Flea collar.
Chuck, I can't go on doing this.
It's  It's all right.
I'm gonna take care of you.
: I spy Wi With my little eye, Friend.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, your blimpship.
Here I am, Mork.
What did you do this week?
Oh, sir, I played "The Wizard of Oz".
I gave the Tin Man a heart.
Is that another of your weird analogies?
Oh, no, sir.
Just a movie metaphor.
See, what actually happened, sir, is there was this robot.
He was nothing but a bunch of nuts and bolts, and I helped him become a person.
You built a monster?
No, sir.
I made a friend.
If you made a friend, why are you so sad?
Well, sir, I lost him.
Can't you make another?
No, sir.
Well, I could, but I haven't got the heart for it.
What do you mean?
Well, sir you know when you create someone, and you nurture them, and they grow?
Well, there comes a time when they : They have to lead their own life, or Or die their own death.
And now your friend is gone forever?
Oh, no, sir.
No.
I'll always keep him right here.
Till next week, sir.
Nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Nanu, nanu!
Who is it?
Who's there?
: Mork!
That novelty store is a bad influence on you.
I saw this incredible movie.
Oh, Mork, you scared me to death.
Oh, I'm sorry.
My boss said this would be funny.
I thought an alien would be funny too, but I guess not.
Was it good for you?
Mort, I know you're working at a novelty shop, but, please, don't bring your work home with you.
Mork!
I'm sorry, Min.
Wait, let me help you dry off.
Mork!
You're so Just leave me alone, all right?
I'll do it myself.
I guess I don't understand very much about Earth humor.
Oh, brother!
Yeah.
Well, that's all right, believe me.
I have a few bleems to understand you Orkans.
By the way, what is this message you left for me?
N-F-C-S-T-H-W-C-O.
And what does that mean?
Nfcsthwco.
Oh, Mork.
And what does that mean?
Nelson Flavor called and said he would come over.
Oh, no.
I'm practicing shorthand so I can have an exciting career as a credit neurologist.
Nelson Flavor's my cousin.
A what?
He's the son of my crazy, rich aunt.
What's a cousin?
Somebody who's related to your parents.
Oh, you've struck a sore note there, Mindy.
I'm a test-tube baby.
Even I'm not related to my parents.
Why have I never met this man?
Well, he's just so straight.
All right, you want to know what he does for a living?
He manufactures attachÃ© cases.
Sounds like a brief career.
Ah, but that's his bag, though.
Arr!
He is the kind of guy that you always get the feeling he's trying to sell you something.
He's always slapping you on the back and shaking your hand.
Oh, combination mugger and masseuse.
You know, you always have a way of looking at the bright side.
Well, I have to, Mindy because, you see, today I got fired from my job.
Oh, no, Mork, not another one.
Yeah, I sold a whoopee cushion to a deaf man.
Jeez.
I only have three music students left.
We're starting to run kind of low on money.
Well, I have another possibility for a job today.
I'm going to feed the animals at the zoo.
Especially the baby elephants.
I'd take them for Chinese.
Yeah, but probably the MSG will make them a little bit hyper.
Probably will, Mork.
That sounds like something you can handle.
Maybe I'll get them stoned first and they'll get the munchies.
Mindy McConnell, how you doing?
Just fine.
Nelson Flavor, at your service.
I know, Nelson.
Gee, I'd give you one of my cards, but I left them in my other dress.
What a little kidder.
Oh, we used to have such F-U-N.
Uh, Nelson, I want you to meet my good friend Mork.
How do you do, Mork?
Ah!
Two little kidders.
Oh!
He was working in a novelty shop.
Lot of fun.
Well, Mindy, uh, reason I stopped by is, you're my most favorite cousin.
Oh Hey, wait.
Honesty time.
You're my only cousin.
That's right.
And I just stopped by to say, "Hey, how you doing"?
Well, I'm Well, I'm doing fine.
Uh, since Dad and Grandma sold the music store, I've been teaching music on the side  Great.
Now, with me there's fantastic news.
I've decided to go into politics.
Oh, gee, I guess that means I won't be getting an attachÃ© case this Christmas.
Oh, darn.
Oh, yes, you will.
You see, the city-council post is just a part-time job, so I'll be keeping my business.
Oh, well, I wish you the best of luck, Nelson, but, uh, isn't the election over a year away?
Oh, yes, it is.
I gotta start now if I want my name to become a household word.
Oh, like "fungus" or "Johnny Mop".
Sort of.
You see, Mindy, the reason I stopped by is that it There are so many, many women in my district, and I wanted to ask you what they think.
About what?
Anything.
Radioactive fallout.
What do women think about radioactive fallout?
Uh, they're against it.
: Hell, no, we won't glow!
Fascinating.
There's a lot more to this politics business than meets the old eyeball.
This city-council post is a steppingstone to the pinnacle, the ultimate.
Owning your own gas station.
Almost.
I want to be the next Vice President of the United States, like my hero, Walter Mondale.
That's quite an ambition.
You think I'm aiming too high?
Well, that's what I want out of life.
I've studied everything about Walter.
You know he lives in Minneapolis?
I read that he lives in obscurity.
: Friend of yours.
I want to have everything that Walter has.
I want the power, I want the glory.
Everything.
Well, excuse me.
I I'm a little confused by one thing.
Isn't it the purpose of every politician to serve people and help them?
Heck of an idea.
You know, that's crazy, but it's just crazy enough to work.
I'll do it to help people.
Hey, listen, Nelson, if you really are interested in the female point of view, why don't you hire me?
Yes!
You could be my campaign staff.
How soon can you start?
Sooner, if necessary.
Good.
Let's go!
Okay.
Hey, Mork, will you call Jeanie and tell her I can't meet her for lunch?
Oh, yes.
Tell her I got a job.
All right.
And have a great election.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, no, it's gone!
Mindy!
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy!
Mindy!
What?
What?
Have you seen my ex?
Cigar?
Sure.
Big joke till somebody gets hurt.
You could put a eye out.
Okay, see, fellas, it's like this: You get this broomstick, you put a little tape on the end of it, you hit the ball, and then you run after it.
See?
Kind of like baseball.
Okay, let me get this straight.
There is absolutely nothing about this game that will help me grow as a person?
I've never heard it described like that.
It's It's stickball.
You know, it's, uh You play it in the street.
You run from sewer to sewer, and, uh, you You use a car for first.
And then you Like, a garbage guy for second.
Some You You ain't a man till you hit three sewers, I'll tell you that.
It's a heck of a game.
It's, uh, super.
Okay, well, so much for bringing the Bronx to Boulder.
Hey, you know what?
You should have told them the stick was organic.
These people are incredible.
They don't even leave me tips.
Oh, there is one guy, however, who does tip me transcendentally.
Oh, good.
Next time, give him a transcendental burger.
No buns, no meat.
You know, Mork and Mindy are the only normal ones we've met.
Oh, right.
Well, speak of the devil.
: The devil!
Yea, though he wanders around, he can hide in the kreplach and nail you.
Come forward now.
You can leave the potato salad.
Do you know why?
Say "pourquoi" if you know why.
Do you believe?
Are you asking?
Pourquoi?
Butter!
Come on home!
You believe!
Well, at least Mindy's normal.
How you been?
Not bad.
I I got fired from another job.
Oh, no.
Sit down.
What happened this time?
Well, you know, I was supposed to feed the baby elephants, so I gave them peanut butter and their trunks got stuck to the roof of their mouth.
Then one of them sneezed and flew across the zoo.
But it's all right, though.
I've got an idea for a corporate franchise.
It'll be called, um, Mork's Ice Palace.
Oh.
And my motto will be, "I only have ice for you.
The best you ever thaw".
That's a great idea, but what are you gonna do when summer comes?
Stop production.
Don't want to flood the market.
Look, don't be discouraged.
I must have tried a dozen different things before I found something I really liked.
What, running a deli?
No, lying in the sun.
Boy, I gotta tell you, Mork, I am really proud of my big brother here.
He gave up all that just to put me through med school.
Oh.
Wish I had a job so I could be proud of me.
Oh, come on.
Don't worry about it.
Hiya, Mork.
Nice to see you.
How's it going?
Mindy said I could find you here.
Are these your friends?
Oh, Nelson Flavor, this is Remo and Jean.
How do you do, Remo?
Jean?
Say, are you folks, uh, registered voters?
Yeah, we are.
Well, in New York.
Awfully nice talking to you people.
Listen, Mork, I've got a little problem.
I wonder if you could help me with it.
Yeah, that's good thinking.
He'll make it a big problem.
Remo!
I've got too much work.
Far much more work than Mindy can possibly handle.
I'd like to hire you too.
Me?
There's no one else here.
You mean me?
Oh, joyous exaltation.
Hallelujah Hallelujah Whoo!
Hot dog!
Yeow!
Woah-ho-ho-ho!
I'm okay, now.
Hey!
Thataway, boy!
Play hard to get.
Mindy said that you were very conscientious, so I'm gonna make you my executive assistant.
Oh, executive?
Does that mean I don't have to work now?
We'll take a meeting on it.
Fantastic.
Welcome aboard.
Glad to have you on the team.
Thanks, N.F. When do I start?
Have your service call mine.
Right away.
And you call me N. In fact, you can call me anything you want, but don't call me late for dinner.
: I love that joke!
Mork.
Good luck.
Hey, Morko, don't blow it.
Hey, uh, wait a minute.
Mork, what are you doing with that money?
I always see people forget it, so I'm gonna give it back.
Mork, that's my money.
Oh, yeah?
Describe it.
Round and silver.
Boy, is my face red.
Yeah!
Gonna see What flavors they got Flavors, ha Political innuendo, yeah Hm, yeah!
I had no idea political activism could be so stimulating.
Really?
I'm kind of bored.
Well, at least we're getting paid.
Yeah.
Eighty bucks a week isn't much.
Wait a minute!
Did you say $80 a week?
Mm-hm.
He's only paying me 60.
That's because I'm an executive.
You're an executive?
My title is "office girl".
Well, you get me a dress and I'll be an office girl.
Well, how we doing today, team?
Ha, ha, ha.
How you doing, Mindy?
Well, that depends, Nelson.
Why are you paying him more than me?
Oh, he's an executive.
So, what does that mean?
He gets a bigger stapler?
No, that means that he does all the important, difficult jobs, so you're free to make coffee.
What are you, Nelson?
Some kind of a male chauvinist?
Well, look, I don't mind making a little coffee, but there's no reason why he shouldn't too.
Well, all right.
I'll go get a pan and fry some up right now.
I'm I'm sorry, Mindy.
I thought making coffee was what women did.
Isn't it genetic?
Oh, sure.
I'm getting some negative vibes right now.
You want me to hire another girl?
Why not let the boy do it?
: I'll just go in the backyard.
You know, get out of the house This entire subject is academic.
I have some very important news.
Are you interested?
After close scrutiny of my financial status, I decided that I can only afford to pay one of my assistants.
No.
The first job I was ever able to keep, and I wasn't able to keep it.
Oh, no, I don't want to fire you.
Your work's been excellent.
Well, you sure can't fire me.
You'd die of thirst.
That's true.
Therefore, in the true spirit of American competition, I'm gonna let the two of you battle it out to the death.
I can't.
I I care a lot about Mindy.
And besides, what would I do without me?
Uh, no, no, that was a That was a kind of a figure of speech.
I'm going to observe you for a couple of days, and I'm gonna choose one of you.
Oh, let her have it, please.
She needs a job more than I do.
No, no, no, wait a minute, Mork.
I do want the job, but you can't just give up.
If you want something, you gotta fight for it.
I don't want to fight you.
Yeah, but it's not that kind of fighting.
Competing is healthy.
Well, are you gonna compete?
Sure.
All right.
I don't want you to compete against yourself, so I'll compete too.
Good boy!
I wish you good luck.
And may the best man win.
: Oh, yeah!
Any coffee?
One sec Sure, I have it right here, just the way you like it.
It's ready and waiting.
Oh, I didn't want any with cream.
Oh, you don't want it with cream?
I have the history of coffee right here.
We've got your cappuccino.
We have a little bit of espresso right there.
Whoa!
We've got your coffee with cream, without cream, with sugar, with lots of sugar for your hypoglycemics, and coffee with no coffee at all.
Whoop!
Listen.
Can you hear inflation?
Too late.
Very, very, very impressive.
Very impressive.
But why do you have one without coffee?
Well, it's kind of a Zen coffee.
It doesn't keep you awake at night and gives you kind of that nirvana buzz.
Very efficient.
Very efficient.
Efficient.
Me, Morko.
Min.
Yes?
Are you mad?
Do I look mad?
Oh, no.
Mork Min?
I'm mad.
Why?
I thought we'd both try to do the job as best we could.
I know.
You're busy trying to prove you can hold a job, and I'm busy trying to prove that Nelson's a sexist.
Don't all humans have sex?
See, there are just some people that believe that men are more capable than women.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Men and women are equal throughout the universe except on Venus.
Oh, yeah?
What's so special about Venus?
Dogs rule the planet and the cats have to make the coffee.
The point is, is we're acting ridiculous.
Look at us.
So let's try to handle this situation in a mature, adult manner, okay?
I agree.
Good.
Excuse me, can I help you?
Well, I hope so.
I sell prosthetic dog ears for Doberman pinschers.
Yeah, I'll help you better, though.
Well, I got a problem.
I cater to the curb trade and Oh, well, if you have a problem, I happen to be Mr. Flavor's personal secretary Well, I'm his personal executive secretary, and I'll kiss and make it better.
No lie.
: Yes.
Don't mind him.
He's really not a well man.
I, on the other hand, am a very capable woman who is privy to even the most top-secret aspects of Mr. Flavor's campaign.
Yes, but I'm his campaign manager.
Say, it with me, now: Nelson Flavor!
You know it.
Nelson Flavor.
You're a fan of it.
It's vanilla.
We're talking all-American, melting in the hot sun  moist, with a cherry on top!
Uh, sir?
Uh Uh, I wish you'd come out of there.
We're We're really trying to help you.
Something going on here?
No.
No.
Just trying to hold the wall up.
Hold the wall up.
Foundation's weak.
What was that?
Big rat.
Who's in there?
Pinocchio.
Are you Flavor?
Uh, yes, I am.
I got a problem, Flavor.
I'll I'll I'll help you with your problem but first you'll have to come out of the closet.
Oh, I don't think that's his problem.
Okay.
Tell the goons to take a walk first.
Is that all?
No.
Look, I'm in canine prostheses.
Mm-hm.
The city's tearing up the pavement in front of my store.
I thought maybe you could stop it.
No problem.
I'll take care of it personally just as soon as I'm elected.
You have Nelson Flavor personally to thank.
Here, have a hat.
Take this brochure.
Read up all about me.
Don't thank me.
Thank the friends who gave us all those contributions.
Word of advice, Flavor, with these two around, I wouldn't run for office.
I'd run for cover.
Uh, Nelson, don't you think there's probably a good reason why the city is tearing up that man's sidewalk?
There is?
This is probably a more complex issue than I thought.
Uh Uh, Mork, give me a full report on this subject.
Right away.
All right, how is this one?
How about this for a byline: "Sidewalks aren't all they're cracked up to be.
Need concrete solution"?
Fantastic!
Ha-ha!
I love the way this boy thinks!
Wait a minute.
What a mind.
Did you hear that?
Nelson, shouldn't I write that report?
I mean, after all, I was hired first.
I have seniority.
Oh, so now you're pretending to be a Mexican?
Look, Nelson, if you want to get elected, you're gonna have to pay attention to the women's vote.
Now, what about Mrs. Hodges?
She's the head of the Women's Political League in Boulder.
She's a very important person.
Yes, that's true, and she's a woman too.
And my landlady, Mrs. Burns.
She's a woman too.
They're everywhere.
I can help you with all of them.
Hm.
This is becoming harder and harder by every You got the political savvy, and you've got all the contacts.
Mork, prepare a report on who you think I should hire for this.
Get me in triplicate.
Give me the original, you keep a copy, and, uh, throw a copy away.
Wait a minute!
Mork!
Come on Nelson!
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
I tell you what.
I'll make my decision this evening.
You two take the night off on me.
And, uh, I'll see one of you later.
: Get it?
Well, Mindy, maybe you're right.
We should be mature about this.
Deal with it as adults.
I'll tell you what.
I'll race you home.
You forget, I have wheels.
Ah-ha!
But I've got more of them!
Are you still mad at me?
Oh, Mork, do I look mad?
Oh, yeah.
You're catching on.
Min, what's wrong?
We used to have so much fun.
I know, Mork.
It's all because of this dumb job.
Well, you take the dumb job.
No.
Listen, tell you what.
Tomorrow morning, we'll both go down there and we'll both tell him that if he can't find the money to To pay us both, then we'll both quit.
It's a deal?
It's a deal.
Okay.
On Ork we call it a partnership or a group corporation.
Really?
Same thing on Earth.
Small world, aren't it?
I'll get it.
Uh!
: Excuse me.
I wonder who that is.
Sounds to me like someone with knuckles.
Hiya, Mindy!
Hi, Nelson.
What are you doing here?
Well, I was out politicking in the neighborhood and, uh, thought I'd come by.
I've, uh, made my decision.
Well, we've made a decision too, Nelson.
We've decided that no job is worth what you've been putting us through.
And Mork and I care for each other very much, but having to compete like this is making us act like different people.
And we don't like those kind of people.
So you either hire the both of us or we both quit.
I accept your resignation.
Listen, none of your political jargon, now.
I don't want any Nixonisms.
I want the truth.
Honest answers.
Come on, now, clown prince.
How about it?
Whoo!
Right here.
I'm ready for it.
Let me have it.
That was an answer.
We're out.
We are?
I'm terribly sorry, but I realized I have a moral obligation to hire a minority.
I'd like you to meet her.
Suzy!
Oh, here, let me carry those for you.
Yes.
She's a minority?
Uh, Swedish.
That should help you with the bleached vote.
Just one more thing, Mindy.
I'm speaking to a women's rights rally tomorrow and I wanted to know what's a good subject to speak about?
How about, um, looking nice for Mr. Right?
I think they'll really respond to that.
Oh, thanks.
Well, I'll see you guys later.
Us blonds are gonna go have more fun.
Rod Stewart.
Oh, we We go see Rod Stewart?
No, we're not going to see Rod Stewart!
Well.
Well, I've lost another job, haven't I?
Oh, Mork.
I mean, look at it this way: You You've already got a job observing Earth, right?
Right.
And you're doing pretty well at that, right?
Well, I I guess you're right.
Well, so, what does it matter that you're having a little trouble finding the right Earth job?
Well, doesn't matter.
Good.
So at least we're friends again.
No.
Why not?
We haven't sealed our partnership.
Oh.
All right, well, on Earth, we do that by shaking hands.
On Ork, we do it by trading clothes.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
So, Mork, did you finally get that job you've been talking about?
Oh, not exactly, your bloatness.
It seems here that on Earth, everyone finds a need to compete with each other.
They compete in sports, in work, in everything.
What do they get if they win?
Something called an ulcer, sir.
I don't know what it is, but it must be wonderful because everyone who's successful gets one.
I guess it'll be a while before you put an ulcer on your mantelpiece.
Oh, noshu, chiefsmoke.
Although Mindy and I did have a competition.
Oh?
Who won?
We both did, sir.
We decided to stick together.
That's very good, Mork.
You're learning about cooperation and maturity.
Oh, yes, your preachiness.
I've learned that even though you win that ulcer, it's no fun if you've lost the one that you wanted to share it with.
Till next week, nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Nanu, nanu.
Mindy.
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
Whoa.
Ho-ho!
Have I got a present for you.
Oh.
Here, go ahead, open it.
Open, open.
Mork, you bought me a present.
Oh, too slow.
I'll open it for you.
That's so nice.
Heh, a mask.
Hi-yo, Silver.
Yeah.
Huh, big black boots, heh-heh!
Big ones.
And, uh Oh, my, yes.
Other things, huh?
Headphones.
Ah!
Gee, Mork, uh, why'd you buy me these things?
I heard you say you were having an affair and you didn't have anything to wear.
So I met this wonderful cabdriver named Aloo and he took me shopping.
Uh, Mork.
See, I'm having a political affair tomorrow.
Uh, these things really aren't quite appropriate.
Are you kidding?
Lumpy said his best customers are politicians.
He even sold a pair of tight shoes to Earl Butz.
Mork, you don't understand.
It's a It's a different kind of affair.
It's for Nelson, my cousin, remember?
He's running for city council.
Oh.
I thought I'd have a little reception so he could meet some local business leaders.
Well, I've never been to a political affair before.
Neither have I. That's why I'm having such a hard time making all the arrangements.
Can I help you maybe?
Can I help, huh?
Je t'assiste?
Ha-ha!
Gee, Mork, I'm sorry, but I don't know how you could help.
I helped before.
Remember that surprise party for Remo when I invited everyone?
Except Remo.
Yeah.
Boy, is he gonna be surprised when he finds out.
Yeah.
Since it's a political affair, maybe I could possibly plan the menu.
Since they're politicians, we could have ham stuffed with bologna.
And then have junkets for everybody.
Oh, I guess I'm not being very helpful, am I?
Oh, Mork, well, you At least you always give it a good shot.
And I'll tell you, I don't know what I'd do without you.
Me neither.
You know, you really are about the best friend I have in the whole world.
You are.
So what's so funny about that?
Nothing.
Then why are you laughing?
I'm not laughing, I I'm sneezing.
That's what happens when I have a cold.
Remember when I had a cold and I took a pill and it made me real small?
Oh, yeah, you laughed then too.
Yeah, but I don't have a cold now.
I must be having an allergic reaction to something.
Huh.
Well, whenever we have an allergic reaction, we sneeze, like, you know, like "Ah-choo"!
Well, that's what happens when we eat burritos.
I must be allergic to something in the room then.
Huh.
Maybe there's something funny in the air.
Hopefully.
Hello, Mindy.
Oh, hi, Nelson.
Nice to see you.
There's my main man.
Nanu, nanu.
: "Nanu, nanu".
Nanu, nanu.
Of course, he's Italian.
: Nanu, nanu.
Great people, Italians.
Ah, so, uh, Nelson, what brings you by?
Well, if I wanna fulfill my dream of becoming Walter Mondale, I've gotta run a good race.
So I've been out in the neighborhood, uh, looking for support.
People should never run without their supporters.
I want the common man to know the real Nelson Flavor.
I want the common man to know that Nelson Flavor cares.
Did I say something humorous?
No.
No.
Sorry.
Mork.
I think if we have something funny to say, we should share it with everyone.
Heh-heh!
No, no, uh, see, Mork's laughing because Mork's happy and And he's happy because you're running for city council.
Aren't you, Mork?
No.
Mork, why don't you go into the kitchen and get us something to drink, okay?
Yeah, that boy is backing a winner, Mindy.
I haven't lost a contest since I beat Sister out as Mom's favorite.
Hey, let me show you this slogan I've been working on.
It's been noodling my gray cells for five days now.
Listen to this.
Are we ready?
"Nelson Flavor.
I'll do it your way".
Are you, uh, making sport of me?
He's making fun of me.
I did not come here to be insulted.
Nelson, now, please I have better things to do with my time.
Now, I'll be seeing you tomorrow night and I hope I won't be seeing Mr. Hyena-puss.
Mork.
This could be terrible.
We've gotta do something about those allergies or it'll be embarrassing.
Well, you know something, Mindy?
I just realized something.
The closer I get to you, the more I sneeze.
Really?
Yeah.
See?
Ha!
Whoa.
Well, maybe it's just something you're wearing, maybe your perfume.
No, I'm not wearing perfume.
Or your hair spray?
No, I don't wear that.
Well, that That pink stuff on your lips.
Hypoallergenic.
No, this is terrible.
I must be  allergic  to you.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Oh  Hey, Mork.
Something wrong?
I have an allergy.
Oh.
Well, maybe you should go get some allergy shots.
What are those?
Well, a doctor injects small amounts of whatever you're allergic to into your arm, and then gradually he increases the dose.
Where I'm from, we have a little man that drills inside your nose with sandpaper and a hose.
You know what?
I bet that you'll find that allergy shots work much better.
You mean I can be cured?
Well, there's a real good chance.
Oh, thanks, doctor, mmmmm.
You're welcome.
Hey, hey, hey.
That's enough of that.
I'm gonna get a shot of Mindy with a water back, boy.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
A what?
I I'm allergic to Mindy.
That's why I need a shot of her.
Oh, wait a minute.
That sorta changes things.
I mean, I did read once about this couple who had been happily married for ten years and then, bam, all of a sudden the husband was allergic to his own wife.
Then the doctor cured him, right?
They were forced to split up.
They never saw each other again.
Step aside.
Don't push.
There's plenty of food in here for everybody.
Exidor.
Mork.
Is that you?
Ah.
Strange place for a swamp.
You're looking well.
Like to join us for lunch?
Yeah.
Friend of yours, Mork?
Yes, we're bosom buddies till the day our friendship sags.
May I help you?
Yes.
Table for 12.
Twelve?
Mork, myself, and them.
Uh, I don't see anybody.
I run into this all the time.
Restaurants won't seat them just because of their color.
Well, come along, my friends, pay no attention to the bigot.
We'll just have to double up.
Mork, I'm a changed man.
Oh, you just got back from Denmark.
That's old business.
I owe the change to a complete new lifestyle.
I have just moved into a boss pad.
I want you to come visit me.
Uh, may I take your order?
Yes.
How's the wildebeest today?
Ooh!
I'm sorry, we don't have wildebeest.
Fine, fine.
Bring the cricket lips.
Yeah, uh, I gotta tell you, this isn't a health food store.
No cricket lips.
No cricket lips?
No wonder this place is empty.
Why don't you have a hot dog?
Mork, I'm not into exotic foods.
I want you to come visit me.
My address.
"1283 Quaking Aspen Drive".
I'm in 5 C. Well, I guess I'll look for the apartment with no number on it.
Aha!
Oh.
What?
!
I should have brought my frog scraper.
Okay, so you're sure that's enough to feed all those people?
Okay, okay, you're the caterer.
Well, I guess we're all set then.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
Okay, good, thanks a lot.
Mm-hm, bye-bye.
Mork.
Mork, what's all that?
It's a cure for my allergy.
I've been worried about you ever since you left.
Things'll be just like they were before I was sick.
Yeah hmmm.
You sound like a phone call I had last night.
Listen, Mork, nobody wants you to live here more than I do, but you just can't spend your life in a scuba outfit.
Yes, I can, if I only talk for three seconds.
That's ridiculous.
We gotta find another way.
All right.
Well, I could always hold my breath.
Oh, now, that's ridiculous.
Oh, come on, Mork, come on.
You You're gonna hurt yourself.
Look, we'll find some way to cure you.
It might take time, but we'll find Mork.
Hey, Mork, come on.
That is being You're being ridiculous.
Whoa!
Oh, Mork, I hate to see you suffer like this.
Me too.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh, oh.
Come on.
Oh.
Oh.
Min  Mindy, I've gotta get out of here.
It's too late.
But where are you gonna go?
Well, maybe I can go stay with Exidor.
Oh.
Well, I guess that's the only thing to do until we find out how to fix things.
Oh, boy, am I gonna miss you.
: I'm gonna miss you too.
Well?
Oh, here.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Here.
Send my things to here.
Uh, take care of yourself huh?
Call me.
What is?
Mork.
What are you doing here?
Well, you said I could come visit you.
Yes, I said that, but, uh, now is, uh Well, it's not a good time if you know what I mean.
Oh, you've got water in your ear, huh?
I'm not alone.
I'm with a W-O-M-A-N.
Oh.
There's more to life than just preaching, you know.
Oh-ho-ho!
Why don't you go home to your fox?
I can't live with Mindy.
She threw you out?
I'll put a hex on her in the morning, as soon as they deliver the dead coyotes.
Tonight you stay here.
Well, what about Touch her and you'll suck seaweed.
Come in, my friend.
Oh, this is wonderful.
Sears meets Rococo.
Mork, this is heaven.
And I owe my salvation to Gretchen.
Say hello to Mork, de Would you go put on some clothes?
Naughty, naughty, naughty.
I love 'em zaftig.
Now you can see why I'm such a changed man, Mork.
It sure beats living alone, huh?
Yes.
Sit down.
Make yourself at home.
Care for some iguana jerky?
No, the little tiny claws get caught between my teeth.
You know, before I met Gretchen, it was all work, work, work.
But no more.
Sit right here, Angel Breath.
I'm so happy you wore the pink.
It's very nice.
I saw what you were staring at.
Oh, it's all right, Mork.
I understand, you're lonesome.
I was lonesome too until Gretchie asked me to move in with her.
This is her place.
How she can afford it, I'll never know.
But when you got a good thing going, don't ask a lot of questions.
Well, Mindy and I had a good thing going, but because of my allergy, no more.
Allergy?
Well, I Every time I get near her, I start laughing.
Oh, relax.
It may be nothing more than mental illness.
Well I'd give anything to be normal again.
Maybe I can help you.
I developed a revolutionary allergy treatment years ago when I was a doctor.
This may be too tough for you, darling.
I injected the hair of a yak in the arm of an orangutan.
Did the cure work?
Do you ever hear any sneezing in jungle movies?
Well, do you think maybe if I put some of Mindy's hair and inject it in my arm, it'll cure me?
Stop, stop that tickling, now.
We can't do that now.
Ha-ha!
It's getting a little late, isn't it?
Late?
It's only7:00.
Well, that is late.
Mork, we'll get back to your problem in the morning.
Come along, Gretchen darling.
If you need me, I'll be in there.
Oh, excuse me.
Where do I sleep?
Why, on the couch, of course with Lola.
Lola?
Gretchen's twin sister.
Oh, they They do look a lot alike.
Oh, Mork.
Oh, it's so good to see you again.
Oh.
Boy, it just hasn't been the same without you around here.
Oh, Mork, if only we could be close again.
Uh, ha-ha!
I can't hear a word you're saying with that gag on your mouth.
Oh, boy.
: Well, I think I finally found a cure.
I think it might work, Mindy.
Really?
I'll try anything.
Anything.
Well What is it?
Well  I have to get a Mindy injection.
You're gonna what?
I have to get a Mindy injection.
Boy, that That sounds weird.
Well, it's worth a try.
What I have to do is take a couple of hairs out of your head and inject them into my arm.
Oh, I don't know, Mork It's worth a shot.
Oh, I'll find some scissors.
Ow!
Those aren't potato chips, buddy.
You can just take one.
Gee.
I have to take a massive dose so there's no problem.
Eeeeeeeee!
Oh, no, my guests are here.
Will you wait?
Mork, will you wait in the bedroom until you're cured?
Shhh.
Please, please, please.
Just wait in here.
You're not as cute with that little bald spot up there, you know.
Great party, Mindy.
All of Boulder's biggies are here.
Yeah, everybody seems to be having a good time, don't they?
Party hearty.
Mindy, when I get elected, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing me when I was your cousin.
Well, you can count on my vote, Flavor.
It's refreshing to meet someone who has such compassion for the rich.
I look at it this way.
Who are the rich, but poor people with yachts?
Excuse me.
Before I run off, uh, can I get you anything?
Impossible.
I have everything.
You know, Nelson, you really amaze me.
You really know how to say what people wanna hear.
Well, there's two sides to every issue.
And I always agree with both.
: Coochie-coochie-coochie, Mr. Prendergast.
Ha-ha-ha!
Hello, hello.
Oh, Mr. O'Keefe, what a lovely tie.
I guess they couldn't guess your weight, eh?
Rabbi, is it true that Sammy Davis eats kosher chicken wings?
Ha-ha!
I feel like such a "mishugette".
Look, a Frisbee.
Wham-o!
Oh-ho-ho!
May I take your hat?
Sears had a sale, how wonderful.
Oh, missy.
Oh, what a lovely map of Utah.
Oh!
Oh, those are veins.
I'm sorry.
Oh, welcome.
Hello.
Hey, hi.
He must have taken an overdose of me.
Who's she?
Uh, you don't wanna know.
Another Wang, Mr. Egg Roll?
Excuse me, can I speak to you for a moment?
Oh, sure.
Ta-ta.
Mork, what are you doing?
I'm not Mork, I'm Mindy.
I'm Mindy.
Mork Mork.
Mork.
Mindy.
Mindy.
Mork.
Now, you listen Nelson, I think we have a party crasher who's drunk.
Why don't you throw her out and I'll go powder my nose?
Wait a minute.
Mork, when does this wear off?
Let go.
You're hurting me.
Who are you?
I'm Mindy, Nelson's cousin, but let's not talk about that.
Let's dance till we don't know who we are.
Come.
I think it's time to leave.
Nelson, our guests are leaving us.
Say goodbye.
Ciao.
Arrivederci.
La-la-la.
Take care.
Whoops, and a gift for you.
Oops!
Something to remember us by.
Oh!
Oh, what a night.
Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy night.
I took off all of your clothes.
Ha-ha-ha!
There's still something I need unhooked if you get the chance.
I've got some good news for you.
The Mindy injection wore off and I'm almost back to abnormal.
Yeah.
You're still mad, aren't you?
Well, Mork, I'm not mad because you blew my party and I'm not mad because Nelson cried on my shoulder till my dress shrank.
But what I am upset about is that you just can't be you.
Ha!
Well, no, I I've tried everything and nothing works.
I've been thinking, you didn't get sick until after I held you close and told you how much you meant to me.
So?
So I think maybe you're not allergic to me at all.
I think maybe you're just afraid of getting too close to someone.
No, no, I I think now you're being real silly.
No, really.
You're being kind of silly there.
No, I think it scares you.
No.
After all, it still It still is a new emotion.
Come here.
What're you gonna do?
I'm gonna help you take the worry out of being close.
Oh, no.
Ha!
Oh, no.
You keep away from me, boy.
Uh-uh.
Nuh-uh.
There's nothing in the air that you're allergic to.
That's why none of those things worked.
You tried air hoses, nose plugs, allergy shots.
And now you're gonna try a little of me.
No.
Ha-ha!
No, no.
: I'm gonna hug you till your eyes pop out.
No way!
: It's all right.
There.
Yeah.
Ohhh.
You stopped laughing.
Yeah.
I think your allergy is cured.
Sure beats the heck out of going to a doctor, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, thanks, you You helped me be more human.
Well, what's an earthling for, after all, right?
Yeah.
You know what?
What?
Your underwear is kinda comfortable.
Let me show you    Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
What did you learn this week?
Oh, beaucoup de choses, Your Lordship.
But mainly I learned a lot about politics.
What's politics?
It's the art of fooling most of the people most of the time, as often as possible.
Politics sounds very strange.
Oh, it is, sir.
A politician will do anything to get in office.
He'll kiss babies, mules.
When he finally gets into office and you call him, they say, "He's not in the office at this time.
Beep"!
Don't Earthlings have any leaders they admire?
Oh, yes, sir, they do.
But they're all dead.
The most famous is one called George Washington.
He's the one that's on the dollar bill that's only worth 45 cents.
What did he do?
Well, he slept here, he slept here, he slept there.
I guess that's why most politicians honor him by doing the same thing.
It looks like you've learned a lot, Mork.
Oh, more than you know, sir.
I even learned that an allergy is nothing to sneeze at.
Argh!
You mean you were sick?
Well, sir, I wouldn't call it that, but I I did develop an extreme reaction to being too close to Mindy.
You're playing with fire, Mork.
I know, sir.
According to the Orkan General, closeness is the leading cause of disease.
Oh, sir, I I used to believe that old voodoo.
But if closeness is so wrong, why are we born with arms, huh?
Isn't that kind of Zen-like?
Think about that till next week, sir.
It'll probably take you an hour or so.
Catch you later.
Until then : Ommm, ommm on the range.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Nanu, nanu!
So, this is where you grew up?
Yep, I was born and raised in this house.
Yeah, I could tell from its cute little pug chimney.
You're really interested in buying it, Mr. Bickley?
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Why is your old man trying to dump it?
My father is trying to sell it, Mr. Bickley.
Hm.
With he and Grandma on the road all year with the orchestra, it's just standing here empty.
Sounds solid.
Yep.
Does this place have indoor plumbing?
Of course this place has indoor plumbing.
A smart buyer learns to ask the tough questions.
It's a terrific house.
Just look at it.
We're even fixing it up a little bit.
That wallpaper looks new.
Is it?
It is.
Mm-hm.
Mork just put it up this morning.
Didn't know the boy was handy.
You know, it's funny.
Somehow, this room looks different to me.
Mork, are you here?
Here I am.
Why did you wallpaper the door?
Well, I didn't want to stop.
I was on a roll.
What do you think, Bick?
It's worthy of a photo layout in House Bazaar.
Mr. Bickley, I promise, by the time we're done, this house'll be as good as new, and you'll be able to enjoy it, just as much as my family did.
Bick, what do you want a house for?
I yearn for digs to call my own.
Let's be honest.
An apartment is for wild young people.
But a house, on the other hand For wild old people.
La, la-la Miss McConnell, I just might be interested in this place.
Oh.
Mindy, that's wonderful.
One day on the market, already we've got a sucker.
I guess that makes you the suckee, huh?
Whoa, ho, ho!
We'll see about that.
How old is this house, anyway?
Well, it's been in my family for about 80 years.
But it's been renovated a couple of times.
Eighty years, huh?
I would imagine the original owner must have paid, oh, $2,000 or $3,000 for it.
Huh, yeah, probably.
Tell you what.
Because I know you, I might even double that.
Look, Mr. Bickley, this house means a lot to me.
I was born here, and my mother died here.
I'm not even that sure I want to sell it.
I think I should see the other rooms, before we dicker over moola.
Listen, why don't you come back tomorrow, uh, when everything's more together, fixed up?
All right, I'll meet you here tomorrow night at 7.
Call it impulse, call it serendipity, but I have a strong Nay, overpowering affinity for this joint.
That's great.
Well, I have to get home, too.
I'm making dinner for Jeanie tonight.
Mork, you stay here and clean up.
Well, all right!
I'll stay here and clean up, you go home and make dinner!
She likes it when I talk rough to her.
Whoa.
Mindy, if it bothers you that much to sell the house, why don't you take it off the market?
But my dad wants to sell it.
I mean, I understand why, but, it's just It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
I think the hardest thing I ever had to do was to refuse a complete physical exam from the chief resident at the hospital.
It was in his Corvette.
I'm still picking fiberglass out of my clothes.
Oh, Jeanie, why am I feeling like this?
I mean, it's just a house.
Well, it was your home, Mindy.
There is a big difference between a house and a home.
Yeah, a house is bricks and wood siding, and a home is memories.
Yeah, where you lick cookies off a mixer blade.
Oh, yeah.
You did that too?
Yeah.
I always had to keep my eye on Remo, so he wouldn't turn the mixer on.
There are a lot of memories in my house.
I'm getting a little sentimental here, right?
After all, what is this?
It's a business deal.
We're out to unload some real estate.
But I am putting in the deal, that no one is allowed to sleep in my bedroom.
Mork!
Mork, what is it?
I think something's troubling him.
Mork, will you come out?
Mork  Mork, will you come out, and tell me what What's the matter?
Oh, nothing much.
Just your house tried to attack me, that's all.
Oh, come on, Mork, now, really.
What do you mean, "Come on, really," Mindy?
Mindy, I'm telling you the truth.
Well, I was at the house, and all of a sudden, I was hanging wallpaper, and the wind blew me across the room Shhh!
Then it got real cold.
Then it got real hot.
And then a swarm of bees came in.
Then a swarm of flies.
Zip, a-zip, zip, zip, zip zip, zip, zip!
And then I ran flamboyantly, screaming to the window.
Ahh, ahh, ahhhh!
And it slammed shut!
Then this is the terrifying part.
I was standing there, and the furniture started attacking me!
Yes!
A little ottoman, and a little ottowoman too.
They were coming at me.
And the armchair couldn't keep its hands to itself.
This is the really bad part.
A strange voice came crying out "Get out of here"!
By the time it said "here," I was here.
Have you been hitting the cream soda again?
No, Mindy, Mindy, you gotta believe me.
You gotta believe me.
Believe you?
What am I supposed to believe, that my house is haunted?
Oh, either that, or I've lost my mind.
Maybe you better call the police and ask them to look for a little gray, squishy thing.
Mork.
Look, he could be right.
You know, there are case histories of haunted houses.
It's a normal house.
I lived there for 20 years.
Mork, tomorrow I'm going to take you over to the house in the light of day, and you can see for yourself that all those things are just a product of your overactive imagination.
Well, I have just one thing to say to that, Mindy.
What?
Oh!
Look, everything is fine.
See?
There's nothing to worry about.
Mork, will you come in here, please?
Evil spirit, begone!
In the name of Joe Garagiola, Bowie Kuhn and Dick Butkus, begone!
Mork, you are perfectly safe.
There's nothing to worry about.
And don't you feel a little ridiculous in that getup?
Maybe I was gonna wear it anyway, huh?
Now, I want you to take a look around.
Do you see any flies?
Do you see any bees?
No, but they were here last night.
Well, bugs get in sometimes.
Oh, yeah, big suckers like that.
Mm-hm.
How does that explain the furniture's moving?
The bees were underneath buzzing?
Sometimes a truck goes by, and it moves things.
You sure?
I'm positive.
"How the mind can wreak havoc on one's sensibilities, thereby dulling judgment".
Timothy Leary, 1978.
I mean, look at this place.
Everything is fine.
And even with the furniture covered like this, it still has a certain warmth.
See this chair?
My mother did the needlepoint on this entire chair.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Did she crochet this stain too?
And see these marks on the door?
That was how tall I was, each birthday, from age 2 to 13.
We have the same thing on Ork, except they tattoo it on the back of our head.
No wonder I'm having such a hard time selling this place.
There's a little bit of me and my family in every room.
Anyone would be lucky to own a house like that.
Oh, that's so nice.
Thanks.
Get out of here.
Did you hear that?
Hope it was a truck.
Get out of heeere!
Mindy, I always believe, that you must follow the advice of the spirit world.
Let's take a hike!
Wait a minute.
It sounds like it's coming from that closet.
That's wonderful.
Let's talk about that over tea in Wyoming.
No!
I'm not leaving.
This is my house.
Well, good luck, aim high.
Mork.
Get ooout of here.
Count to three and open the door.
Right.
1, 2, 3.
No.
Ahhh.
Hee, hee.
Ow W W One.
Tw Tw Tw Twooo.
T T T Three!
You didn't get out of here.
That's not nice.
Exidor.
What are you doing here?
Vacationing.
But this is my house.
Of course.
You can't vacation in your own house.
Be kind, she's riding on empty.
Out of the water!
Don't you see that fin?
I hate to burst your very tiny bubble, but this is not a resort.
It's a private home, and that is a closet.
A closet?
Mm-hmm.
The vacation is over, Exidor.
Over?
Mm-hmm.
But I thought checkout time wasn't until 12:00.
Out.
Out?
Moi?
Mm-hmm.
All right, boys, let's go!
This place is getting too commercial.
Steinmatz!
I don't care if it's not Labor Day, your summer's over!
Well, I told you there would be an explanation for all those strange things that were happening.
Well, you know something, Mindy?
Sometimes you're wise beyond your dimples.
Thanks.
Let's take a look around, and see if there's anything else we should do before the house is sold.
Better do it quickly.
It's getting kinda chilly in here.
It is.
Let's get out of here!
I just don't understand it.
I mean, there's gotta be a logical explanation for what we saw.
Oh, there is.
Your house is haunted.
You know, if I were you, I wouldn't talk about this to anybody, 'cause you could find yourself wearing a cute, white blazer with the sleeves that tie in the back.
Remo, I'm not imagining things.
We saw it, didn't we, Mork?
Mork?
: Yes!
Yes, it's horrid!
Oh!
Oh, there were ghosts in there.
Hundreds of 'em!
Will you?
Will you get up, please?
Do you realize?
Do you realize you're acting with less than total dignity?
Oh.
Now, I want you to be cool.
Like Jack Nicholson.
Damn straight.
All right.
You gotta be fearless, like Charles Bronson.
Kill the women and children first.
Yeah, that's a boy!
Well, if you ask me, you've disturbed the spirit world.
Disturbed the spirit world?
How?
Mindy, you're selling a house that's been in your family a very long time.
What a bag of Bandini!
There are things in the cosmos that must go unexplained.
Mindy, I don't want to upset you, but after Mork told us what went on in your house, well, I did a little research, and I found this old book in the library.
"Colorado Legends".
Oh, intriguing.
Hoo, hoo!
That's just bunk!
You recognize this?
Yeah, that looks like my house.
It is, in 1921.
But it was known then as La Follette House.
La Follette is my mother's maiden name.
Well, this book says that two sisters built this home in 1894, Lucinda and Deirdre La Follette.
Lucinda and Deirdre?
They must have been my great-great-aunts or something.
Well, according to this, Lucinda was the older sister, and she wasn't so attractive.
But she was madly in love with this handsome, young silver miner named Harrison Monteith.
But he was in love with the young and beautiful Deirdre.
Then, one night, they found Harrison's body.
He'd been mysteriously poisoned, but no one could prove who did it.
After that, the sisters boarded themselves up in the house, and they were never seen again, until the day they died.
Oh, that's great.
That happened in my house?
Yep.
Terrific.
It could be that Lucinda and Deirdre don't want their house sold.
Which reminds me, we are supposed to meet Mr. Bickley at the house at 7.
Well, I'll tell you what.
You tell this story to Mr. Bickley, and you're gonna scare the pants off of him.
No, I don't think so.
I think Mr. Bickley will be amused by this quaint little anecdote as I was.
Well, we'll see you later.
So long.
Mindy?
Mindy?
Mork?
I'm here.
Okay.
Well, he's not here, Mindy, let's go.
Mork, you're acting like a child.
Now, will you get in here and hold my hand?
Oh they're still here, Mind.
I think I'm sensitive to those people that you can see through.
Well, everything looks all right.
I wonder what ghosts do, when they're not busy scaring people.
That's the last thing I would have dreamed of.
Ahhh!
I was just testing the plumbing.
Oh!
Are you ready to show me the rest of the house?
Oh, Bick, you don't want to see it.
Mr. Bickley, there have been some strange things happening in this house.
What would you say if we told you that it might be haunted?
I'd say you were trying to cool my interest, because you had a better offer from an Arab.
Oh, no jive, Bick.
I mean, this house should be moved to a padded neighborhood.
Hey, I don't go for all that hooey.
I want this house.
Ahh!
Ahh!
But not that much!
Oh, no!
Oh, oh!
Ha, ha, ha!
It's boarded up!
Mork, we're trapped!
Oh, Mindy, something terrible is happening to me.
Mork!
Mork?
Who's Mork?
I'm Lucinda.
Mork, will you cut it out?
We gotta get outta here.
You're not gonna sell this house.
It's our home, isn't it, Deirdre?
Whatever you say, Lucinda.
You're older, and you know more.
Mork, are you possessed?
Possessed?
Ahhh!
I'm repossessed!
No man's gonna ever come between us again, is it, Deirdre?
I don't know, Lucinda.
If I wasn't so full of meshugaas, you wouldn't say that to me.
Well, you are, and that's why I tied you up!
Oh, no, another intruder.
Come on, Deirdre.
I'll teach you how to make that tea that makes 'em cough up the pancreas.
Come on in, girl.
Ahhhh!
Oh, Exidor!
Thank God somebody normal is here.
It's all beginning to make sense now.
You kicked me out, so you could vacation in there yourself.
No!
You gotta help us!
I don't have time.
I'm late for the hukilau.
Just came by to pick up my necessaries.
But you can't go.
Mork's in trouble.
You can't just leave.
I follow the sun!
I'm off to hang 12!
Oh, no, wait!
Ohhhh!
Oh, look, we have a gentleman caller.
And he's a man.
Let's waste him!
Oh!
Ha, ha, ha!
How would you like some gator tea, hmm?
Oh, hello.
You're so beautiful.
You look just like Harrison.
Oh, how would you like to make a lonely ghost Phwoo.
Very happy?
Wow!
The vacation isn't a total loss.
I just met two chicks!
How'd you like to meet me down at the beach?
Oh!
Oh!
Sorry.
Listen, we'll frolic in the tidal pools, and let the hermit crabs have their way with us.
Aloha!
I'm off to the hukilau.
Come back, sailor.
Ohh.
I'm goin' with him, Lucinda.
No, we'll both go!
But what if we go?
We'll never be able to return back here to belle rev.
Come on, girl, let's party.
Come on, now!
Haaaa!
Whew!
They're gone, Mindy.
Oh, Mork, you're all right!
Oh!
Wow.
It's not easy having body guests.
Everything's all right now.
I think they're gone.
Look, the boards are off the window, and it's not cold in here anymore.
Oh, Mindy.
You gotta get rid of this house.
You gotta sell it, ditch it, burn it.
Oh, Mork.
How can I?
In In spite of what's happened, it's It's my house.
It's my past.
What's wrong?
Remember I told you I was I was sensitive to those spirits?
Well, we're not alone.
Oh, no.
We're not?
There's another spirit in here.
Oh.
It's a gentle one, though.
I think it wants to talk to you.
Oh, no.
I remember my little daughter playing peek-a-boo behind this chair, after she had made that caterpillar out of the egg carton.
Mom?
Remember that time, you put your daddy's underwear on the puppy?
Mom, is that you?
Mom, are you all right?
Oh, yes, dear, I'm fine.
There's so many things I want to ask, but I don't know where to start.
It's all right, darling.
But I don't have much time, and there's something that I need to tell you.
Do you remember that old teddy bear that you loved so much, and you You hugged it till it was smooth and the stuffing was coming out, and the eyes were gone, but you still didn't want to give it up?
Yeah, but I don't understand what this has to do with But, dear, you finally outgrew it.
There's nothing wrong with that.
There's nothing wrong with giving up things that you've outgrown.
Goodbye, dear.
Do you have to go?
Yes, but don't worry, darling.
Wherever you are, I'll always be with you.
: I love you, Mom.
Mind, the spirit's gone.
Yes, she has.
Oh, Mork, that was my mother.
Oh, Mind.
What did she say to you?
She told me a story about my teddy bear.
But I don't think she was talking about the bear, as much as she was talking about this house.
You know, Mork, it's It's really tough to let go of something you love, especially when there were so many memories created here.
But now I realize that the memories that are living in this house are living in me, and they always will.
Oh, Mindy.
Well, maybe you and I can create some more memories to keep them company.
Oh.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork.
Sir.
Why are you wearing that strange cranial covering?
Well, it's for protection, sir, but it's all explained in my report.
Do you have an interesting report this week?
Oh, indeed I do, O portly one, and it's all in rhyme, to make it fun.
I went to fix up Mindy's house.
I was quiet as a mouse.
When suddenly, The house was shaking!
It wasn't San Andreas quaking.
The room filled with flies, Nyoom, and bees, nyaagh, And scared me Out of my B.V.Ds.
Whoop!
And a voice told me "Get out of here".
I said, "uh, uh," in fear.
I ran to Mindy's willy-nilly.
They all told me that I was silly.
"There's no such thing As ghosts," said she, And pried my arms From around her knee.
I swore to her That there was a spirit, And took her to the house To hear it.
Then we got the explanation.
It was my friend Exidor, On vacation.
I said he was a silly goose, And then all hell broke loose!
"La la la," said Mr. Bickley.
A moment later, He turned sickly.
Then we found out Why the house was cold.
It was unwilling to be sold.
What's the moral of this poem?
That there's no place Like your ho-em.
Thank you, Mork.
I liked your rhyme.
Thank you, sir.
Nanu, until next time.
Then we'll meet in a warmer clime.
Get together and have Thank you, Mork.
Next.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Nanu, nanu.
Okay, the customer wants a salad with bean sprouts and alfalfa sprouts on a bed of shredded lettuce.
Is he here to eat lunch or graze?
I don't care if he smokes it as long as he pays the check.
Well, ask him if he'd like me to put it on a plate or in a feedbag, okay?
: Butu, Kimbe, stay with the caravan.
: All right.
All you germs, bite the dust.
Come on.
Die, you little buggers.
Die.
There you go.
Come on.
Yeah!
You with the hamburger, freeze right there.
Drop it.
Drop it.
Spread those buns.
Spread the buns.
All right, I have a right to read you your rights.
You have a right to remain bacillus Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
You saw him.
That germ pulled a gun.
Come on, what are you doin'?
Will you cut it out?
Mindy's going in the hospital.
I have to kill germs.
Don't!
Don't!
Don't!
Hey.
You behind the gherkin, freeze it.
Ha-ha!
There's another streptococcus.
I bet the small one.
I'm sorry.
You can't leave yet.
Hold on.
Uh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
There aren't any germs in here.
Of course there are no germs after my "spritz-krieg".
Ha-ha!
In the name of Louis Pasteur, I Wait a minute.
I've just committed germicide.
Oh, you must have millions of little germs at home going  "Where's Daddy"?
Hey, Mork, what'd you do to your hair?
I cut off all the germy parts.
It was cheaper than having it cleaned.
Is it safe yet?
What is going on here?
I am going to have my tonsils out, and Mork has been running around driving me crazy.
Mindy, Mindy.
Mindy, you shouldn't talk.
You should rest your tonsils for the coming-out party.
I'll translate for you.
You're going into the hospital?
Mindy, Mindy.
: It is true that Miss McConnell is going into the hospital for a treatment of the neck infection, but soon she'll be back to her old, uninfected self, and back being so cute and adorable and shiksa-like.
Well, Mindy, ha-ha, there's nothing to worry about.
A lot of people have their tonsils out.
Yeah, I had mine out in the first grade.
Yeah, he was only 14.
So I was old for my age.
Did you put 'em under the pillow for the tonsil fairy?
No.
I don't believe in that stuff.
I just put 'em in a jar.
Well, actually, getting your tonsils out, it's a breeze.
That's right.
It's a very simple procedure.
Yeah, most of the doctors know what they're doin'.
Most of the doctors?
Mindy, I'll handle this.
Most of the doctors?
You see, they got losers in every profession.
Like I had an electrician out here six times to fix that lamp, and it's still broken.
Now, imagine if that was your heart.
Thanks, Remo.
You know, Remo, uh, I don't think she wants to hear all this.
Oh, come on.
You come home from med school with all those funny stories.
Tell 'em the one about the doctor who left the instruments inside the patient.
It's great.
That really happened?
Well, uh, they never found out but the guy goes disco dancing and gives himself an appendectomy.
You know, occasionally accidents do happen but not often, not enough to let it upset you.
Thank you very much.
I think I'll go check myself into the hospital before you two change my mind.
Good luck.
Don't worry, we'll visit you.
Well, kid, break a larynx.
Ha!
Thanks.
Don't worry, Mindy.
When your tonsils are out, I'll whittle you wooden tonsils, and put a scarecrow on your tongue to scare the woodpeckers.
That'll work.
Hey.
If it doesn't, you'll talk  like this.
Seven thousand and forty-seven, seven thousand and-forty-eight What are you counting?
I'm timing to see how long it's been since I buzzed for the nurse.
Well, there's gotta be some way to get a nurse in here.
Yeah, sure.
Just fall asleep and she'll come in and wake you up.
Min  Hiiii.
How're you feelin'?
Oh, all right.
I brought you a little somethi" to show I was thinkin' of you.
Look, a brain.
Heh!
No, actually, it's a flower.
Heh-heh!
It's the biggest one I could find.
It is a big one.
Hope you have a short, fat vase.
Either that or you could wear it behind your ear.
Argh, argh, argh!
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you.
Well, uh, are you fixed yet?
Is that what you're in here for?
I had my cat fixed, and he's never been the same since.
No, I'm only having my tonsils out.
Well, that's what my mother said they were doing to the cat.
The operation isn't until tomorrow.
Oh, Susie, this is Mork.
Hi.
Nanu, nanu, bite-sized person.
The hospital's low on space, so they put me in the children's ward.
Oh, I couldn't tell.
Ha-ha!
Well, honey, are you ready for your tests?
I thought I was supposed to have 'em over an hour ago.
Oh, sorry.
I'm the only nurse working three floors tonight.
You're the only nurse?
Yeah, a lot of nurses are out sick.
I guess there's something going around.
Yeah well, I gotta go, Mork.
I gotta get some more blood tests.
Well, good luck, Min.
I hope you pass.
Don't let anyone cheat over your shoulder and see your corpuscles.
Oh, I bet you I know what ward he's from.
Oh, he's just visiting.
Oh, then you ought to be leaving.
Visiting hours are almost over.
Oh.
Bye.
Bye, Min.
Good luck.
Be careful.
Well, well, actually, I'm not really worried at all.
I mean, she told me she had the best doctor.
Well, my mom told me I had the best doctor.
Oh if everyone has the best doctor, then where do all the dead people come from?
I don't know.
Maybe the stork brings 'em.
Is this your first time in the hospital?
No, it's my second.
The first time I was born.
What are you in for now?
I did a dumb thing.
I swallowed my bubble pipe.
How'd you do that?
Well, you see, it's like this.
I was jumping rope and then It wasn't a pretty picture.
Now I'm all full of bubbles.
If you push my stomach, you could probably feel 'em.
No, no way.
I saw Alien.
Mind if I make myself at home here?
Sure.
H-hey.
Back from where I come from, we don't have hospitals.
We just have a little building you drive up to and you You tell your ailments into a clown face and out comes a pill, heh.
A Doc in the Box.
You betcha.
Heh-heh!
So how are they gonna get that bubble pipe out of you?
Beats me.
I guess they'll have to cut me open.
Cut you open.
Seriously, how are they gonna get that bubble pipe outta you?
No, really.
They'll cut me open and take out whatever's giving me trouble.
Cut you open.
Heh-heh-heh!
Pfft!
Ah-ah-ah!
Ah-ha-ha-ha!
I should stay here and protect Mindy.
That might be good.
Either that or she'll have her insides on the outside.
She might get her liver caught in her pantyhose.
No, no, no.
I'm sure they'll put back everything important.
Besides, it won't hurt.
They knock you out first.
Who does?
The guys with the masks.
Masks?
Whoa, kemosabe.
Why do they do that?
Maybe they don't like you to see who goofs up.
Oh.
Oh, are you still here?
Uh-huh.
You're right.
They are goofy.
I'm here and she doesn't even know it.
Visiting hours are over.
No, no, no, I'm gonna stay here and protect Mindy.
Well, I've seen a lot of strange things happening in this place.
I assure you that Mindy will get excellent treatment.
You're not gonna cut her open and auction off her innards?
I've seen the little bottles.
No, you have my word.
All right, well, it's just 'cause I care for her.
I mean, she's like a brother to me.
Oh, don't worry.
Your brother Mindy will be fine, just as soon as she comes out from under the knife.
Knife knives, masks.
What's the name of this hospital, Our Lady of Central Park?
I've gotta go.
All right.
WOMAN : Dr. Newman, please.
Please report to Pediatrics.
Min.
Mind, it's moi, Mork.
Still in one piece?
Argh!
I think she's sleeping.
Susie, boy, you've been through some changes.
Oh Mind.
Mind.
Heh-heh!
Mind, wake up, you don't wanna sleep through your operation.
Heh-heh!
Uh-oh.
You're not Mind.
What happened to Mind?
I mean What's going on here?
Mind?
Who's Mindy?
You're a strange man.
Not as strange as the people who work in this place.
Oh, Mind.
First Susie and then What happened?
What's going on here?
This is strange.
What are you talki" about?
Well, don't you understand confused babble?
What are you doing here?
Where's Mindy?
There's no Mindy here.
Uh, you must be in the wrong room.
No, she's gotta be here.
I mean, she was here yesterday.
Oh, well, I wouldn't know.
I broke my wrist yesterday.
I had to go out and get it fixed.
Why didn't you have it fixed here?
Here?
You gotta be kidding.
Ha-ha-ha!
This has gotta be the same room.
There's the flower I brought her.
Oh.
Well, okay.
What's her name and her age?
Uh, Mindy McConnell, age 23.
Ehhh.
Ha-ha!
Um, well, she has two good arms, sorry, um.
You see, that's where you went wrong.
No, sir, this is the children's wing.
We have no big people staying here.
Well, if she's not here, then she She's lost.
Oh, now, please don't worry.
Even if she is, she's bound to turn up sooner or later.
I hope it's soon because she needs a tonsillectomy.
Oh, dear.
Well, I hope she hasn't been confused with With somebody else.
Why?
Well, if that's what has happened, there's a good chance she might get the wrong operation.
No, no, no, no.
BOTH : No.
Oh, not again, not after last week.
No.
Oh, no.
Boy, this is certainly a crazy place to work.
Yes, sir, I'll try to help you with the problem.
Ah, yes, sir.
Yes, we do have a number of nurses who don't speak English.
So just be patient and point to where you're bleeding.
Yes, Miss Chayefsky.
Uh, Mr. Burnett, there's a gentleman to see you.
He seems very upset.
You gotta help me.
You gotta find Mindy.
Is this him?
Mm-hm.
Are you the administrator?
Yes, I am.
Well, here it is.
You want it, you got it.
A dollar bill?
I talked to everyone in the hospital.
They say the buck stops here.
Sir Calm down.
We're not going to get anywhere if you don't speak slowly and clearly.
: Yes, I think you're right.
Yes, of course.
Now, what seems to be the problem?
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh.
Well, I brought my friend Mindy here for a simple operation and now she's gone.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I'm sure we did all we could.
Well, no, she hasn't gone belly-up.
Sh-she's just gone.
She's disappeared, lost.
We lost a patient?
Well, heh, she must be somewhere in the building.
How far can she get in bare feet and a gown that opens down the back?
I'm sure everything will be fine.
Really?
Oh, really, yes.
Miss Chayefsky, when you get time, would you just get our lawyers on the phone?
Why don't you just say the eagle has landed.
Again?
Ixnay.
Aren't you gonna do something?
Organize a posse, get out the tonsil-sniffing dogs, things like that?
Oh, in good time.
Uh, but before we get started, there is a little paperwork to, uh, take care of.
Oh, here.
Would you just sign this form, please?
What is this, a missing persons form?
Well, not exactly.
It's just a formality which basically says that, uh, no matter what's happened, the hospital isn't held responsible.
But you are responsible.
She didn't lose herself.
Uh, well, I don't blame you for being upset, but these things happen.
I mean, this is a very big place.
We have a lot of halls Oh, you're not kidding.
A lot of wards.
I mean, it's like a maze.
Here a ward, there a ward, everywhere a ward ward.
And there are pages: "Calling Dr. Fine".
He doesn't answer his calls.
The doctors are missing too, aren't they?
Now, son.
Try to see this from my point of view, will you?
They don't give me enough staff, they don't give me enough money.
All they give me is the challenge to help people.
What about finding my friend?
Now you have a challenge too, haven't you?
But before you go, would you sign this form?
I can't help you until you do.
You're gonna leave her lost until I let you off the hook?
Hey, fella, I don't make the rules.
Oh, yeah?
All right.
I'm taking this with me, and this buck's not gonna stop until I find Mindy.
You can't find her now.
Visiting hours are over.
Well, but rescuing hours have just begun.
Well, what about my form?
Take your form and file it.
You're in your room, Mrs. McDonald.
McDonald?
Now, let's take another one of these little pinkie drinkies and then we can rest.
Oh, I'm too tired to rest.
I don't feel good.
Here.
Here you go.
Now, soon you're going to have that brain operation and then your headaches will just disappear.
Now, you can lie back and rest.
Hee-hee!
Whew, I'm starting to feel better already.
Bye.
Bye.
Don't worry.
Brain surgery isn't as bad as it sounds.
Ooh, it is noisy, though.
Oh, hello, doctor.
Hello there, sickie.
Doctor, I hate to complain, but nobody came by this afternoon to change my dressing.
Oh, dressing, are you kidding?
That gown is you.
It goes perfectly with that hat.
All you need now is some feathers, some rhinestones and nine tana leaves.
Doctor, you have a very funny bedside manner.
I believe that a good doctor leaves his patient in stitches.
Har-har-har!
I used to love a good laugh.
Oh, doctor, you know what?
What?
: Oh.
Mindy.
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, you're awake.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Hi.
Hello.
Ha-ha!
Actually, I think this is the best type of physical therapy.
It gives the patients something to live for.
Oh, Miss McConnell, we'll have you out of here in a "fribbet".
A fribbet?
Yes, a medical term meaning a surrey with a fringe on top.
That girl's name isn't McConnell.
It's McDonald.
No, my dear lady, I'm a doctor.
Don't make mistakes unless it's a matter of life and death or a bill.
But the nurse who was just here said that's Mrs. McDonald.
She's in here for brain surgery.
No, no, she's in here to have her tonsils out.
I guess it depends on how deep they drill.
Yeah Mindy!
Min.
Hello, Mindy.
Mind, Mind, Mind Woo-hoo!
Oh, no.
They got you too.
Oh, Mind.
All my life I've been getting you into trouble.
Now I've gotten you in the biggest trouble and there's nothing I can do.
Oh, come on, Mind.
Hello.
Mind.
Here we go, here we go.
Here we go.
Hey.
Whoa!
Woo!
That's all physical therapy.
Mindy.
Mind.
Mind, here we go.
Okay.
Okay, whoa, make a wish.
Here we go.
There we go.
No, bad view.
Okay, Mind, come on  Hi.
Mind Doctor, what are you doing?
I was just checking for lumps.
Okay We have to get this patient out of here right away.
Nonsense, that patient is having brain surgery in two hours.
You haven't done anything to her yet?
Of course not.
I just came in to shave her head.
Oh, no.
Don't you shave one hair on her chin.
Mindy, Mindy Hello.
Mindy, Mindy.
No, Mindy is me.
What's up, doc?
Min.
Mind.
Mind Oh.
: Oh, Mind, Mindy.
It's me, Mork.
I dressed like this 'cause I was looking for you.
Well, I think that I'm over there.
Very fun, Min.
Let's get out before they turn your head into a planter.
Come on, let's go.
They wouldn't do that to old Mindy What's my last name again?
McDonald.
E-I-E-I-O  Ah.
Why, she's a little delirious.
I just gave her a sedative.
Her name isn't McDonald, it's McConnell.
You know, you look very familiar.
You assisted me last week in that lip transplant for Mick Jagger, remember that?
Well Well, I've re-diagnosed this patient and her brain has cleared up, heh.
See you later.
Let's go, Mind.
No, Mind.
Woo!
Ahhh.
Wow.
That's a great ride.
Since I usually get sick on ferris wheels.
Oh, that's wonderful.
There we go.
Mind, I think I can take you home.
I'll take those tonsils out there.
Let's go.
There we go.
Let's go, Mind.
You dance divinely.
Do you come here often?
Well Ow!
Woo!
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
What is going on here?
I can hear you halfway down the hall.
Oh, Dr. Roland, I'm so glad you're here.
That doctor is behaving very strangely.
Doctor, I think you should put that patient down.
No, she's mine.
Oh, doctor, please.
Give Mrs. McDonald back to us.
No, it's not McDonald, it's McConnell.
McDonald.
Over 30 billion sold.
Wanna see my arches?
I knew I should have been a plumber.
Look, uh, nurse.
I, uh think I'm gonna need your assistance here, all right?
Min Mindy, come on, let's go.
Wait!
Hey, no, no, don't, don't.
Don't you realize you're up six stories?
Oh, I love stories.
Whoa!
Mindy, Mindy!
Get back!
Back!
I have a thermometer here and you don't know where it's been.
Mindy.
I'd like to thank you all for coming and I promise I'll make a darn good Miss America.
Be careful.
There's a lot of gravity down there.
Come on, jump.
No.
You jump.
Mind We'd better get them before they fall.
No, stay back.
Stop!
Stay back!
Bruce Lee lives.
Wahhh!
Wahhhh!
Wahhhh!
Whoa!
He bit me!
Oh, there you are.
Mr. Burnett.
Yes, I had a feeling you were on this floor when we found Dr. Brody in the closet wearing underwear and striped suspenders.
Do you know this maniac?
Now, he's okay.
His friend Mindy McConnell got mixed up with a patient named Mavis McDonald.
Oh.
Her name is Mindy.
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, Mindy.
Now for my first dive: A forward half gainer with a full-twist summy.
Mind!
I'm so glad you did that.
You know why?
Why?
'Cause I can't swim.
Here, Mindy, have some more ice cream.
Oh, thanks, but I think I've had enough.
Oh.
Oh.
Keep the You know, if you have any more, we're gonna send you home in a freezer bag.
Ha-ha-ha!
A freezer Freezer Freezer bag.
You know, Mindy should be sore for only about a day.
I'll be sore for about a week.
Why are you sore?
Well, the nurse bit me back.
You know, this whole rigamarole proves what I always say: You gotta be sick to go in the hospital.
So simple, yet so meaningless.
You know, I just can't believe we had all that trouble over a typographical error.
Funny, there were no typos on the bill.
Oh, well, speaking for my future profession, first I wanna apologize.
But despite what happened, doctors and nurses really do wanna help.
I think you've probably gotta help them by keeping your eyes open, asking questions.
Especially if you fear for your life.
You know, Mind, I'm glad I saved you from that brain surgery.
If not, I'd be sitting here now eating ice cream with someone I didn't know and that someone would be you.
You know, Mork, what would I do without you?
Well, probably sitting somewhere in front of a mirror watching yourself drool.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Hello, Mork.
Oh, Your Corpulence, you sound sick.
Very observant, Mork.
Why haven't you gone to one of the health clowns?
All the ones nearby are broken.
Oh.
I've been trying to find a doctor, but none of them can afford me.
You won't believe this, sir, but on Earth, people pay doctors.
Ha-ha!
That's crazy.
Oh, I know.
Without sick people, doctors would have nothing to do.
Oh, I know that, Your Lumpyship.
But I've learned on Earth this week that staying healthy's like everything else in life.
It all depends on how much money you have.
Were you ill?
Oh, no, no, sir.
Mindy was, but she's all right now.
I had to rescue her from a hospital.
What's a hospital?
Well, hospitals are places where Earthlings are interred while they're sick and not released until they give the hospital money.
It sounds like a jail.
Well, sort of, sir, except the food is worse.
I guess if you get sick on Earth, you're doomed.
Oh, no, no, sir.
You see, most doctors and hospitals are quite good.
But I also realized this week that while it's tough to be sick, it's also tough to be a doctor.
See, after all, to err is human, but most people won't allow doctors to be human.
Till next week, sir, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Nanu, nanu.
Hey, here's one: "1963 Chevy, "only 15 miles, slight damage.
"Call after 6 p.m. Ask for Evel".
Forget it.
What's wrong with your old car?
We're tired of going through the car wash behind a tow truck.
Beggars shouldn't be choosers.
If you don't get a new car soon, you're gonna be hitchhiking to medical school.
: Eureka!
They are finished.
Look, my Greek cookies.
They make me so happy.
I've got to dance till my knees explode and my socks fall off.
Come with me.
Dance now.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Come, my little garbo.
Sip on some ouzo and nibble my cookies.
The Greek typhoon.
All right, I'll try one, let's see You can eat them on a Monday A Tuesday, a Wednesday A Thursday, a Fri  Give me those.
Ah-ah!
Never.
Ah-ah-ah!
Now  Your cousin Nelson's here again.
Oh, hi, Nelson.
Hi, Nel  Excuse me, madam.
Nelson, what is wrong with you?
I've been getting threatening phone calls.
And quite frankly, it's scaring the bejeebies outta me.
Sit down and tell us about it.
Some member of the lunatic fringe has been calling and saying that if I don't drop out of the city council race, I'd better start praying.
That's gonna be trouble.
Mindy said you didn't have a prayer.
Eh, do you have any idea who it is?
No, except that it's a woman's voice.
A woman?
He's scared of a woman.
Oh, please.
And why shouldn't he be scared of a woman?
You never heard of Lizzie Borden, Mata Hari, Ma Barker?
Ma Bell.
Yeah, women have the right to be homicidal maniacs too, you know.
Hey, cease and desist, quipsters.
My life could be at stake here.
Nelson's right, it doesn't matter whether it's a man or a woman.
Crank calls can really be scary.
Yeah, birdcalls can be scary too.
Let me tell you, obscene phone calls aren't any fun either.
I got a whole bunch when I was living back east.
I was petrified.
Really?
Did you call the phone company?
No, they wouldn't press charges.
He was one of their best customers.
You know, there must be a reason that that woman is making these calls.
Yeah, who would hate you enough to do something like this?
I've got it.
It's an old girlfriend that you used and threw away like a dirty sock.
I don't think so.
Most girls I use never call me again.
It's probably political.
Maybe it's one of the other candidates that's doing it.
Think about it, Nelson, it'd have to be somebody conniving.
Somebody who'd stop at nothing to get what he wants.
Don't be ridiculous, Min.
Why would Nelson call himself?
Boop!
Boop!
Boop!
Mork?
Mork?
Boop!
Mork.
Think you could read a little more quietly?
Sure.
: Boop.
: Boop.
: Boop.
It's for you.
Why, that's amazing.
How did you know that?
I didn't.
But I didn't wanna stop reading until I got to see if Lolita gets to use her crayons or not.
Whoa.
Ha-ha-ha!
Nelson.
What is all this?
It's a disguise.
Ah, you're masquerading as a traveling flasher, eh?
I got another phone call from that crazy woman.
Really?
Yeah.
Are you sure it's the same one?
Down to the last threat.
She asked me strange questions like, "Guess who's not gonna make it till election day"?
Maybe she's just trying to change your political image.
Yeah, she says she's gonna do it with an ax.
Oh, that's terrible.
Are you on your way to a hotel?
No.
Are you, uh, going out of town?
No.
You're staying here.
Oh, thank you, Mindy.
I knew that when a fella gets in a jam, the first people he should turn to is family.
Oh, cuz.
Ohhh  I just wanna say thanks.
Thanks.
Make yourself at home.
Nelson, if I were you I'd call the police.
I did.
They said that a crank call isn't a crime.
I guess they can't do anything till I'm actually dead.
Well, maybe they'd investigate if you just laid there real still.
Well, we'll deal with all this tomorrow.
In the meantime, you're safe here.
Thanks, Mindy.
Morky.
It's people like you that make people like me like people like you.
Right now I'm too tired to think.
I'm I'm going to bed.
Good night.
Nighty-night.
Well, guess it's time to hit the straw.
You mean "hay".
Well, if you insist.
Hey, it's time to hit the straw.
Well Good night.
'Night.
I feel much safer staying over here.
Good.
Don't turn out the lights!
What's wrong?
I I can't sleep with the lights out.
Oh.
Maybe I better read you a story, that might help.
Oh, that's a good idea.
All right.
Here you go.
"The moon highlighted her golden hair, and she could hear the soft twittering of a nightingale as she plunged the dagger again and again into Derek's back".
Don't tell me, um, Orkan calisthenics?
No, I'm working on my impression of Nelson's lava lamp.
That's pretty good.
Okay, guess what I'm doing.
Billy Carter.
No.
Oh, the Vienna Hogs' Choir.
No, it's Nelson snoring.
He kept me awake all night last night.
Why would Nelson bring his lava lamp?
It gives him a sense of security, makes him feel like he's almost hip.
Phone.
Mm.
Hello?
No, he's in the shower now.
Can I help you?
I'll take a message if I can.
Something to write on.
Pardon the delay, it's hard to get good Caucasian help.
Hello  Mork, she says she's gonna get us too and she knows where we live.
Oh, no.
Death, despair, doom.
Come on, Min.
We've gotta bolt the windows up.
We gotta barricade the door.
Come on, Mindy.
Don't worry, come on.
Mork.
Oh, order some pizzas, Min.
Make 'em frozen pizzas, we can suck on 'em, they'll last longer.
This is serious.
We've gotta think about this calmly.
All right, Mind.
What we can do is create an electromagnetic force field.
We need some zirconium and a cambrium laser.
Now, where do you put your cambrium lasers and Hi, guys, what's all the hubbub?
Get down!
Get down!
Do I sense danger?
No, you sense threats.
That woman called again.
She said she'll arrange it so you can dance cheek-to-cheek with yourself.
She did?
Don't ever leave me.
The worst part is she knows where we are.
Now, we've gotta figure this thing out.
Why don't you come down here and cower with us, Miss Brave?
Not on the floor, on the sofa.
What, you guys think she's gonna shoot us through the window?
It was probably Mr. Death.
It was Mr. Barstool.
Well, so this is politics.
I guess I shouldn'ta left your phone number with my answering service.
You left my number with your service?
Well, only a few of the calls I get are death threats.
I do have an attachÃ© case business to run, you know.
Come on, you guys, I mean, I think we're overreacting to this whole thing.
I mean, there's not gonna be any violence.
I read the people who make phone threats rarely cut you into little pieces.
How rarely?
Well, never more than once.
Come on, let's not be so paranoid.
And let's not let this crazy woman get to us.
Let's just start acting like normal.
See?
Now, isn't this better?
Somebody broke my window.
Oh, it's nothing much, Min.
It's just a smoking can.
It's a bomb!
Toss it, toss it!
Okay.
Not to me!
: Well, we'll do all we can.
This stink bomb is probably just an isolated case of vandalism.
That's what some people said about Pearl Harbor.
But our lives are in danger.
: Maybe that's why Joseph Wambaugh left the force.
This place kinda smells like cheese on a radiator.
What price charisma?
Well, in case the worst happens, I decided to make out my last will and testament.
Oh, good.
Could I have your lava lamp and your collective works of Walter Mondale?
Nelson, what we have to do is figure out why somebody's after you.
I've got it.
I've got it.
When you were a baby, you were abducted by a wandering tribe of albinos.
They were gonna make you their king.
But you were smart, even at that young age, and you escaped by running away nude in a snowstorm.
Will you be logical?
I'd never run nude in the snow.
Well, here's another one.
You were Siamese twins, separated at the head, and she thinks you got the better deal.
Her name was Anathesia, and she's after you like Wait, I hate to interrupt you Hardy Boys in action.
But, Nelson, is it possible that you might have offended somebody in one of your campaign speeches?
I don't think so.
Let's see, my last speech was Wednesday.
Well what did you talk about?
Oh, the usual: Nothing.
Try and remember everything you talked about in that speech.
Well first I came out for keeping Boulder green.
Oh, that'll get the leprechaun vote.
Ha-ha!
But it could antagonize the businessman.
Well, I also came out for green factories.
Did you make a stand on anything?
I did say that Boulder should have a monorail system but for safety's sake, it should have two tracks.
And I really was firm on that one.
That's it?
I think so.
I did come out against pornography.
I said that if I were elected, I'd close down every strip joint in this city.
Well, how many are there?
One.
It opened a couple weeks ago.
Well, that's probably it, Nelson.
One of the strippers must be threatening you.
I-if that's for me, I'm not here.
If that's her, I'm gonna tape the conversation.
Answer.
I'll answer it, but don't expect me to be polite.
Hello?
That's fine.
She hung up, let's play it back.
WOMAN : If you don't get out of town, the next bomb's gonna be real.
And the three of you will be splattered all over Boulder.
Oh, Mindy, we've gotta get out of here before they make human confetti out of us.
The first thing we have to do is find this woman.
She's gotta be one of the strippers at the Bare Facts Club.
Eh, you can't go.
They'd recognize you because of your eyes.
Eh, it's up to you and I, Mind.
I'm not going into any strip joint.
Come on, sometimes it's your moral duty to be sleazy, so get your pasties, let's go.
I've got faith in you, Mind.
You could crack this case just like Sam Spade.
Oh, what a great detective.
Too bad he couldn't have puppies.
Mork, this is so embarrassing.
Would you look at me?
What would my grandmother say if she saw me dressed like this?
Take it off.
As a matter of fact, she would.
Are you here for the audition?
Oh, yes.
Sid Morkenstein, William Morkis Agency.
I love you, darling, more than you'll ever know.
I represent Miss Mindy Rose Lee.
She's the Boulder Bombshell.
Pleased to meet you.
I love the balloons, darling.
I bet you don't have a pet porcupine, huh?
No, not anymore.
Does that sound like the voice on the phone?
I don't think she knows how to use a phone, Min.
Well, let's move on.
Love what you're doing, sweetheart.
Let's have breakfast, lunch, dinner one day.
Fantastic.
Hello, Sid Morkenstein, William Morkis Agency, how are you?
Love Hey, great-looking bear.
Sure am.
That's why I'm in this business.
So's the kid.
Right, sweetheart?
Yeah.
Sure is a nice place.
It's a lot better than the joints I've been working in.
Yeah What are you talking about?
Uh, pardon me, are you interested in politics?
No, but I had an old boyfriend once that taught me how to pronounce Zai-air.
Excuse me.
I bet you'd be really bummed out if some politician tried to close this place down.
No, there are always places to work.
We move around a lot.
I hear that.
But you haven't seen anyone move till you've seen the Boulder Bombshell.
I mean I'm talking about She takes off so much you can see her bones, you know?
Ho-ho-ho!
Wazoo, wazoo.
Ha-ha-ha!
I'm talking good times here.
Yeah.
Excuse me, Sid?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Oh sure, darling.
Excuse me.
We'll get back to you, I'll put you on hold.
Love you.
Knock off this stuff about the audition.
I'm not getting up there and doing anything.
Do you think any of these ladies did it?
I don't think so.
None of their voices sound familiar.
And she said that she could get work anywhere, so why would they care if this place closed down?
Oh.
I've got it.
The owner of the club is a woman.
Ha-ha-ha!
Maybe.
Okay, girls, let's get this show on the road.
I want you to get up here and strut your stuff.
Mindy, get your struts ready.
And remember, only the best girl gets to audition for the boss.
I don't think I can go through with this.
Why not?
Nelson would take his clothes off for you.
Okay, you, with the balloons.
You're first.
Harry, give me a spot.
Do you mind?
My name is Cherry Balloons, and I did the following number at a recent stag party.
I got a standing ovation.
Play something soft and sultry.
Okay, thanks a lot.
Yeah, I think we get the idea.
We'll give you a call, okay?
Mork, you better get backstage and find out if the owner is a woman before I end up on that stage.
Now, there, sweetheart.
Sid Morkenstein, William Morkis Agency, how are you?
Hey, it's a great cigar.
Too bad about Castro, huh?
Listen, I've seen better dancing at the New York City Ballet, you know what I'm talking about?
Hey.
You gotta see the Boulder Bombshell there.
'Cause there is a woman there that I want your boss to see, because when she can move it, she really moves it.
It must be cream 'cause milk don't flow like that.
Hey, hey.
What do you want?
Basically I want your boss to see the young woman here.
Even blind people go, "Something interesting around there".
The boss'll be out when he's ready, you know?
All right.
Fantastic, we'll get back to you.
We'll have breakfast, lunch, dinner someday, okay?
Yeah, you just wait your turn.
My pleasure, I feel great energy, it's gonna be great.
Okay.
Hey, hey.
Okay, you, you're next.
Come on.
Please play something reeking of innocence.
Right.
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, no, no, no.
What kind of an audience do you think we got out here, the Muppets?
Well, I refuse to make artistic compromises.
Come on, Lex.
Good luck, kid.
Okay, Bombshell.
You're next.
Mork, I can't go up there.
Come on, what's the matter?
You ashamed of your body?
No.
Well, then, let's see it.
Wouldn't you rather see his?
Come on, I don't have all day.
Come on, come on.
What kind of music do you want?
You don't want no music.
Play it Acapulco.
No   Thanks a lot there, Bombshell.
That was really exciting.
Wait a minute.
It isn't fair.
Her snake's doing a jungle picture, how about that?
Now, listen.
Don't just tell me thanks.
Get in there and tell your boss that Sid Morkenstein wants to see him, man.
No one demands to see the boss.
Hey, well, it was just a request, really, I Um, listen, she had a little stage fright, you know?
A little nerves.
You know how it goes, don't you, sweetheart, don't you?
I guess I'll show you how it works.
Hit it, son.
Eh, all right, all right, all right.
I ain't crazy about your act, but maybe the boss might like it.
Hey, boss, come on out here.
Oh, thanks, Mr. DeMille.
Oh that's the boss.
Mindy, I think our little hunch was wrong.
Yeah.
Thank you sweetheart, darling.
Have your service call my service.
What it was.
Heh-heh!
Beautiful day, great energy for the room.
: All right, Ron, what's going on out here?
She's our man, Min.
Thanks.
I wanna thank you two for preventing the untimely demise of a future city councilman.
Hey, we're just a couple of courageous kids.
Weren't you scared in that strip joint?
Are you kidding?
Mindy McConnell knows how to handle herself.
Oh, I was really amazed.
The police came and arrested that guy.
I'll never forget his last words too.
: "How'd you know it was me"?
There's no place in this country for soprano terrorism.
Did you look nice in your costume?
Pretty nice.
Oh, real nice.
And she got a ride home in a big Cadillac with a man with a wide-brimmed hat.
This whole ugly business has taught me a very valuable lesson.
I'm never gonna make a stand on anything again.
Well, you'll make a perfect vice president.
And I'm gonna be a lot more careful now that I know that people are out to get me.
Oh, don't be paranoid.
Next you'll say people are trying to poison your food.
Eat your sandwich.
Uh um What do you think?
We're gonna poison you?
Eat it.
I'm not hungry right now.
I-I'll taste it for you, Nelson.
There we go.
Not bad.
Mork!
Mork, what's wrong?
Too much mustard.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson, come in Orson.
Here I am, Mork.
Oh, coming in loud and clear, O Great Seam-Stretcher.
Let's dispense with the niceties, Mork.
What did you learn this week?
Well, why tell you, when I can show you?
Hit it.
What are you doing, Mork?
Well, sir, it's what Earthlings call a striptease.
You wouldn't believe this, but some humans will pay money to watch other humans take off their clothes.
You mean that Earthlings would pay to watch me undress?
There's a difference between a striptease and a strip threat.
Speaking of threats, sir, some humans will use threats of physical violence to get their own way.
That's terrible.
Indeed it is, because it makes other humans afraid to voice their own opinion.
I see.
They think it's safer to keep things under their hats.
Oh, especially their heads.
But I thought Earthlings prized their freedom of speech very highly, Mork.
Well, they do, sir.
But only a few are willing to pay the price to keep it.
Until next week, sir.
Nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Nanu, nanu.
Boy, Nelson, what a turnout.
I'm really impressed.
I'm really shocked.
They came because my advisor here delivered my message to the people.
Yeah.
And his message was, he was paying for lunch.
Here's what it comes to.
Fine.
I'll pay you next week.
Next week?
Sure.
You can trust me.
You have my word as a politician.
Drop those forks.
Kitchen's closed.
Take that wiener out of your mouth.
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
I was out polling the neighborhood.
Why are you so out of breath?
Well, it was a Gallup Poll.
He's all yours.
Well, did you get a good cross section?
I didn't want to discourage you, so I just polled your friends.
Must have been, uh, pretty one-sided.
Yeah, it doesn't look good.
Nelson, don't you think you should start your speech?
Oh, yes.
Uh, Mork, would you mind introducing me to the general electorate?
Is he here?
I love what he does with refrigerators.
: I get it.
Yeah.
Ah!
Ladies and gentlemen, please!
Can we have a moment here for your attention?
Thank you.
I'd like to introduce a man that flattened me and my dreams, and a man who will flatten your dreams too.
Let's bring him up here.
Nelson Flavor, the albino wonder.
Come on.
Bring him up here!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Come on, now.
Here we go.
No pictures, please.
It hurts his little, pink eyes.
Come on.
Let's move.
Thank you.
Good morning all you over-18ers, and welcome.
Come on, Mork.
I can't help it, Mindy.
I got this ringing in my mouth.
As I was saying, ahem  Do something about it.
I think Orson's trying to call me, Min.
Excuse me.
Mork, why are you ringing?
Because my knocker's broke.
Well, since you're the sergeant at arms, why don't you throw yourself out?
It would be my pleasure.
Will you come with me?
Will you call my lawyer, Mindy?
Come on.
Listen to me Let go of me.
Orson calling Mork.
Come in, Mork.
Orson calling Mork.
Come in, Mork.
Oh, yo, sir.
What's up?
You never used the day rates before.
We've got big trouble.
Right here in Boulder City?
Mork, this is deadly serious.
A spaceship from the planet Necroton landed on Earth.
Oh, no, not the Necrotons.
Our archenemies?
No, they're a hockey team.
Of course they're our archenemies.
Oh, good retort, sir.
That's one for you, eight million for me.
This is no time to be cute.
They're after you.
Me?
Why me, sir?
Because you're there.
They want to know what you know about Earth to see if it's worth conquering.
But I I don't know anything about them.
What do they look like?
I don't know.
No one's ever seen one and lived.
For all I know, they could look like anything from a human to a wedge of Velveeta.
Thanks a lot, sir.
That narrows it down to everything.
Fortunately, it's a limited threat.
The Necrotons can only survive in Earth's atmosphere for 24 hours.
All you have to do is what any patriotic Orkan would do in a time of war.
Hide.
Exactly.
Sir.
Just remember, not only is your life in danger, but the lives of every Earthling.
Well, too bad you're not here, your tubby-tude.
We could all hide behind you.
Nanu, nanu.
Necrotons.
Ha-ha!
I'm not afraid of them.
So in conclusion, I want you to remember my campaign theme: A vote for Nelson Flavor is a vote for me.
Hear, hear.
Mo Mork!
Min, I was working on my impression of a turtle.
What is the matter with you, Mork?
I mean, you've been weird before, but never this weird.
Orson said the Necrotons have landed and I've gotta hide.
The Necrotons have landed.
Of course.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about our archenemies.
They're here, but I don't know what they look like.
They could be anything.
They could even pose as food.
Hey, Mork, you want a snack?
What did you do that for?
It was self-defense.
Uh, he's not feeling too well.
Yeah, well, neither is my antipasto.
I'll send her a card.
Min!
Min, they could be posing as anything.
That That might be the mothership.
Mork?
Mork, are you home?
Mork?
What?
Mork!
Min, it's all right for me to sit on my face, but I don't think you can.
Will you get out of there?
You can't hide in there.
Now, will you tell me what is going on here?
Well, all right, but I gotta make it real quick.
Now, what would you do in this situation?
I would slow down and speak more clearly so I could understand.
All right.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just a little panicked.
Here's the straight poop.
Well, you know, the Necrotons are the scourge of the universe.
Now, you know that Orkans have emotions.
Well, Necrotons only have three emotions: Hate, lust, and greed.
No love?
No way.
And ever since I can remember, Ork has been at war with them.
But I thought all Orkans were pacifists.
We are.
That's why every time we go to war, we have to go into hiding.
Claude Rains would be one of our national heroes.
Now, you see, all we have to do is hide long enough, then they get tired, and they go away.
Huh.
Well, what do they want with you?
Well, I think they want my reports to Orson.
You see, they want to find out whether Earth is worth destroying or not.
: They want to destroy the Earth?
Why?
Well, I guess it keeps them busy, Min.
I don't know.
Well, I got to find someplace to hide, Min.
Yeah, but No, I can't hide in there.
I've been out of the closet for a year now.
Yes!
I'll use one of your dresses.
Mm-hm.
Hm-hm!
I'll go incognito.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why?
Why are you taking my dress?
What better way to hide than your dress?
You know, hiding is a drag.
Well, Min, where did you put those tapes of Ethel Merman Sings Led Zeppelin?
Mork, where are you gonna go?
I don't know.
I mean, someplace where no one ever goes.
The frozen tundra, the barren desert, a Mike Curb rally.
Isn't there anything I can do to help?
Oh, don't worry.
Necrotons can't breathe Earth's atmosphere for more than 24 hours.
I mean, I'll be back tomorrow, unless, well Unless they find me.
But what'll they do if they catch you?
Well, people who have dealt with Necrotons have a saying:  No, wait.
Wait a minute, Mork.
Look at it this way.
I mean, there's over that live here in Boulder, and And so they'd never find you if you just stayed here.
Good old logical Min, you old palooka.
You're right.
I mean, the odds of them finding me here in this particular room in the next 24 hours are  Three hundred and sixty-two million to one.
See?
Must be my lucky day.
Oh.
Einstein was right, Min.
Space is curved.
I am Captain Nirvana of the Necroton black army.
Kama, Sutra, fall in.
Orkan, you have exactly five seconds to get your meaningless life together in one bucket.
Min, those are Necrotons.
They're as mean as they are ugly.
No, stay away.
Stay back.
Ah.
I'm going to get all the information you have out of your little pea-brain.
It's up to you, bright eyes.
It can come out of your mouth, or I'll, uh, suck it out your ear.
They mean business, Min.
Hope this room is Scotchgarded.
Mork, do something.
I am, Min.
I'm shaking as fast as I can.
You can't just barge in here and suck out his brain.
Orkan, curb your pet.
Pet?
Min, Min, heel, girl.
Heel.
Heel.
Heel.
Don't worry about them.
I'll guard us with a force field.
See that, Min?
She's frozen in her tracks.
She won't thaw for months.
Is it spring already?
Your silly, little Orkan weapons are useless against us.
Mork, run for it!
Silence the pet.
I'll pet you, you bimbo!
Mork, I'm trapped!
Oh.
It's not that bad.
We'll have her housebroken in a month or so.
Come on.
Let her go, please!
Private, the transinducer.
The pink one?
Or the yellow?
Oh, just give me one, you twit.
All right, you cute, little hot potato, you are going to be under my power.
Ha-ha!
I'm afraid you've underestimated the incredible, hulking will of an Orkan.
I scoff at your sparkling balls.
Ah!
Bachelor number one, if we were to go Tijuana All right, take him to the spacecraft.
Aw, don't worry about your master.
He's gonna be just fine in our little torture chamber.
Hm.
Must be the runt of the litter.
That was good.
I never knew you had a talent for pantomime.
No, uh, Mork I Uh Nelson, you gotta help me.
Uh, Mork was kidnapped.
Kidnapped?
Yeah!
They, uh They came in here, and they blew the door off the wall, and then they carried him away.
Dastardly!
Who did it?
Three gorgeous, voluptuous women.
That'd get my goat.
No!
No.
They They're vicious and violent, and they're gonna do something awful to him.
Like what?
Well Um I can't tell you.
Could you act it out?
Oh!
Oh, Nelson, I don't know what to do.
Nobody's supposed to know.
This is no stranger here.
This is Nelson talking.
First cousin, same flesh.
Hey, hey, hey, remember when we were kids and I confided to you that I put the goldfish in Mom's clam chowder?
Hm?
Well, you owe me one.
You're not gonna believe me anyway.
If you want me to help you, you've gotta level with me.
Oh, all right.
Um uh Mork was kidnapped by three creatures from this planet called Necroton, who came to Earth to suck out his brain and to And to invade To destroy our entire planet.
You can tell Mom about the fish in the chowder.
Ooh!
Nelson, it's true!
I was trapped behind a force field right here, Well, somewhere, but But it was here.
And then this Mindy, I understand.
It's not easy being a single woman in the Now Generation.
You've got career versus marriage, tradition versus liberation, pregnancy versus being careful.
Nelson!
The stress is too much, isn't it?
I'm telling you the truth.
Stress can do funny things, like put the door on the couch.
Remember how Mom used to bend spoons?
She'd bend them and bend them and bend them Nelson!
Look, I mean, you know me.
I'm I'm good old logical, reliable Mindy.
I wouldn't make up something like this.
All right.
I'll help you.
You will?
First, we'll get you to a nice home in the country, far away from the urban hubbub.
Why?
For your mental and my political health.
I'll pay for everything.
Are you saying that I'm crazy?
Well, Mindy, "crazy" is a relative term.
And as Jimmy probably said of brother Billy, "Why my relative"?
NECROTON  Just think, we wouldn't have even known of the existence of Earth if we hadn't found those two Bogart films when we pillaged the planet Ovits.
Have they been much help to you?
Not much, sir.
You see, it's not accurate information.
First of all, the Earth isn't even in black and white.
Then it's essential we capture the Orkan for the information.
Yes.
I've already done so, sir.
In fact, he's in the spaceship right now.
Excellent.
You must extract every report he's ever made to his home planet.
I hope you can handle this, Captain Nirvana.
Yes, sir.
I appreciate your confidence in me, sir.
I have no confidence in you.
The only reason you got the assignment is everyone else is out with the flu.
Well, uh Uh, don't worry.
I won't let you down.
As they say on Earth, "Here's looking at you, kid".
Private Kama, bring in the prisoner.
Oh, I can handle this.
I know I can.
Aah!
Oh!
Why are you making all those noises?
We haven't even done anything yet.
I know that.
I'm trying to make you feel guilty.
It's an old Jewish trick.
All right, smart guy, turn around.
Hands in the air.
What are you gonna do to me?
Why, I'm going to search you for secret weapons.
Nothing here.
Turn around.
Ooh!
Oh!
You seem to have rung my bells.
What are you hiding in your pocket?
Is that a secret weapon?
No, harmless stuff.
I'm just glad to be here.
No No, uh, it It's a yo-yo.
Yo-yo.
Oh, yes.
We We have something like this on our planet, but without the string.
How do you get it to come back?
Well, we don't.
It's never been a big seller.
Oh, and here's something very special.
This is chewing gum.
Yes, we have that on Necroton.
You put it in your mouth and you chew.
Your mouth?
Uh, well, I suppose that would work too.
You're not gonna get anything out of me!
I'm never gonna tell you anything!
We'll see.
Ar-ar-ar!
What would you say if I told you that we're going to put you on a rack and stretch your body till your tiny, little bones crack?
I'd love it.
I'd look like Tommy Tune.
All right, then, maybe I'll just hang you up by your feet until your spleen slips out your nose.
Just so happens that's a hobby of mine.
Then you're gonna love it when I wrap a rope around your neck and start your head up like an outboard motor.
Ha-ha!
That old Orkan party trick?
Of course you don't realize that we Orkans scoff at pain.
Ar-ar-ar-ar-ar!
All right, the jig is up.
You'll spill your guts now.
Oh, no!
A torture chamber.
The ultimate Ramada Inn!
I've gotta get out of here!
Oh, no, the Supremes!
We know one thing about you little, sissy Orkans, and that is you can't stand any intensive physical pleasure.
Ha-ha!
We'll have you moaning for mercy.
Oh, no.
No!
Romantic music, soft lighting.
Oh, no!
Not the hot tub!
Not the hot tub!
Yes.
Get behind the modesty screen and drop 'em.
You'll never get away with this.
If I don't come home, every cop in Boulder will be on your tail.
What's a supper?
What's a cop?
What's a Boulder?
What's the difference?
How should we start?
Maybe we should rub him down with baby oil.
Baby oil?
No, no.
That'll leave a slick in the hot tub.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm stalling for time.
Snap it up.
I have a planet to destroy.
All right.
I'm Uh, suspenders.
Moral support.
Pants.
: Hold on.
Okay  Are you finished?
Well, I think so.
Then haul it out here, toots.
Why aren't you naked?
Well, I am.
This is just a tattoo.
All right, you Orkan dog I'm not an Orkan dog!
They have three legs and fall over every fourth step.
Why don't you save yourself a lot of pleasure, hm?
Talk.
Never!
Never!
My Earth files are top-secret.
All right.
Kama, Sutra, sic him.
: Oh, no, Mr. Bill!
Oh!
Listen, wait a minute!
Under the Jupiter Convention I'm entitled to one last meal.
Well, all right.
What would you like?
Something to go.
No!
No!
I'll never tell you anything!
Tickle him.
Oh!
Hm.
I must say he has a lot more spunk than I gave him credit for.
Let's just get right to the A stuff and throw him in the hot tub.
No!
No!
No, these are my new tennies!
No!
No!
Ah, I love my work.
What's in that?
Bubble bath.
Oh!
Oh, you're cruel!
Sutra, blow in his ear.
No!
No!
Kama, darling, kiss his little neck.
No!
Don't leave a mark.
Oh!
Oh!
Now, hold him down.
I want to read to him.
Oh, reading can't hurt me.
I've been to Evelyn Wood.
Oh, no?
What about smutty limericks?
No, you're despicable!
You're despicable!
There once was a lady From Nezzum.
Whose butt was as big No!
No!
Yeah!
Hey!
That was a library book.
We're wasting time, Your Highness.
The Orkan doesn't seem to be breaking.
Yes.
Put him on the trembler.
No!
No one has ever been able to endure that.
What's a trembler?
The doomsday machine.
Oh, no, magic fingers.
He'll talk now.
Oh, think bowling.
Think bowling.
Think baseball.
Think Tom Snyder.
He's formed a mental block.
We can't break through.
He's tougher and smarter than I thought.
There's only one way to break through.
Leave him alone with me.
I'm sorry you did that.
I forgot to close my eyes.
Oh, you've been through such a lot.
Oh, yeah.
War is hell, isn't it?
Oh, you poor thing.
You know, this is very hard for a Necroton to say, but, well, I I'm I'm really sorry.
Oh, I thought being a Necroton meant never having to say sorry.
But you don't understand.
This is my last chance.
If I don't suck out your brain and destroy the Earth, well, I'm I'm : I'm gonna lose my job.
Oh, you poor kid.
I'm sorry I was such a pillar of strength.
And those vultures are just waiting for me to slip up so that they can come in and move into my boots.
Oh, gee, I I didn't know mindless destruction was such a competitive field.
You know, sometimes Sometimes I just wanna chuck the whole thing and kidnap a family I could call my own.
Oh.
I hate to see a barbarian unemployed.
Tell you what.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Oh.
How can I ever thank you?
Well, a simple goodbye would be nice.
Just give me any little old piece of secret information that you have for my report.
For instance, these people, the Americans, who is their leader?
Well, they've been trying to figure that one out for years.
Um, they pick a new leader, though, every four years.
How do they do that?
With a wet T-shirt contest.
What are the duties of this leader?
Well, every spring he throws out the first baseball.
After that, he throws out his cabinet.
And he tries to make everything perfectly clear, except for the atmosphere and the water.
And in cases of national emergency, he takes immediate action and books himself a trip overseas.
Well, all leaders are alike, but what about the people?
Tell me about the people.
You want to know about all of them?
Uh-huh.
All right.
I guess I better start with the A's.
First of all, there's Aaron Ackalala.
He was born in Hawaii.
He has two children, Allen and Arthur.
Allen has a tattoo on his forearm of Jack Lord with the inscription, "Why'd you leave the show, Danno"?
And his And his favorite quotation is  His other son now raises herbs on Maui.
Uh, how many people are there on this planet?
Well, four billion, and would you believe it?
They all sleep laying down.
But to really understand this planet, you must participate in one of their sacred Earth rituals.
It's entitled Simon Says.
You must do everything that Simon says.
I'm ready.
All right.
Simon says close your eyes.
Simon says spin around twice.
Simon says take one step up.
What's the object of this game?
To win.
Simon says you lose.
Oh!
Why, you dirty rat!
You'll never get away with this.
Oh!
Nanu.
A privilege dealing with you.
Come back here!
: So long, sweetheart.
Don't take wooden dollars.
: Yeah, that's right.
Let me go!
Unhand me!
Kama, Sutra, help!
Oh!
Aah!
What happened?
Oh, I just accidentally backed into the machine.
Where's the Orkan?
Oh, he just accidentally ran out the door.
Uh, but we'll catch him again.
Don't worry.
Anyway, I've got some really juicy information that I That I know will please our leader.
NECROTON  Fool, you blew it again.
It's all meaningless drivel.
The Orkan has tricked you.
But I tortured him all over the place.
Let me talk to him.
Well, he, uh He ran away, but But we'll get him back.
You imbecilia, Orkans are the best hiders in the universe.
You'll never catch him now that he knows you're after him.
I have a plan.
Oh, boy, do I have a plan.
Uh, I'm gonna make him come to me.
You better, captain, or you'll be space dust.
What are you going to do?
He seemed very attached to his pet.
Yes, I believe he called it "Mindy".
Catch her.
Bring her here.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.
I think I'll keep her little foot for my key chain.
Captain Nirvana!
Captain Nirvana!
What took you so long?
Well, the pet was a little hard to handle.
It bites.
Bite me and I'll remove your cheeks.
Leave us alone.
Who do you think you are?
I mean, you You break down my door, you mess up my house, you kidnap my best friend and And now you threaten my cheeks?
I mean, you're pushing me too far.
Well, if you think you're pushed too far, my job's on the line.
Oh, I never wanted to be in the military in the first place.
For one thing, you have to wear these drab uniforms.
I don't know.
I mean, who could look good in this?
The bass player from Kiss?
Will you get in the cage?
Wait, wait Wait a minute.
Uh, uh, maybe you and I could be friends.
Friends?
Yeah.
Like, if we were friends, we'd do nice things for each other, like, uh, I might lend you my best purse, and you might not kill me.
Well, it's a cute idea, but I don't think it'll catch on.
No, no, wait!
Think about it.
I'll bet you deep down inside, you and I are a lot alike.
I doubt it.
Uh, what do you plan to do with me?
Well, I haven't made up my mind yet, but right now I need you for bait for your master.
He is not my master.
And how do you even know he's gonna come here?
Well, I don't know.
It's just a hunch.
But I got a feeling he's got a yen for you.
It's called friendship, but obviously you wouldn't understand.
Well, whatever.
But what is it?
You've never had a friend?
Well, I I once felt something for a man named Torga from the planet Lepto.
Torga from Lepto?
You know him?
No.
Just the name.
Oh.
Well, anyway, he was Well, he was a wonderful kind of guy.
I mean, he had long, beautiful hair and a flowing red beard.
He was He was, well, so nice and warm.
Really?
Whatever happened to him?
I had him made into a jacket.
And there's something about Mork too.
Of course, he wouldn't make a very good jacket, but I like him anyway.
Well, if you like him so much, why don?
Why don't you just let him go?
Oh, well, it's strictly business.
You see, after I get all the information out of him, maybe I won't destroy him.
Maybe I'll take him home with me and donate him to the zoo.
Yeah, but if you do that, you might as well kill him.
Okay.
Now, will you get in the cage?
I'm not getting in that cage.
How would you like to get into something a little more comfortable, like thumbscrews?
If you need me, I'll be on my perch.
Mindy?
Where are you?
Min!
Min!
"While you were out".
How nice.
"Dear Orkan swine, we have captured your pet.
"If you value your life, give yourself up.
"Otherwise, we'll realign her head, "steam-clean her thighs, and rotate her limbs.
Yours truly, Nirvana".
Now, just remain calm.
Deep breathing.
Remain calm.
Mork.
Nelson!
Oh, Nelson, they got Mindy!
I was gonna get her and rescue her, but now it's too late!
It's my fault!
It's my fault!
Hey, easy, easy, easy.
That's better.
Nice outfit you got there.
Pretty boss threads.
I told Mindy you'd be back.
: You're not gonna believe this.
You know what she said?
She said that you : Were captured by three gorgeous women from another planet.
By the way, where were you?
I was captured by gorgeous women from another planet.
You crazy nut!
Where's Mindy?
She was captured by three gorgeous girls  From another planet!
I get it!
I get it!
The two of you are in this together, right?
No, no, no.
Nelson, no!
It's true!
They captured me, and they took me to their spaceship.
Then they forced me to undress and sit in a hot tub with all of them.
A hot tub!
I get it.
Candid Camera, right?
I heard it was coming back on.
Okay, Allen Funt, come out wherever you are.
Oh, you're too much.
Well, goodbye, Mork.
Goodbye, Mr. Funt.
Let me know when I'm on.
Hi, Mom.
Three gorgeous girls from another  MINDY : Mork!
Min!
Shh!
You shouldn't have come here.
I couldn't leave you alone.
Oh, but Mork.
I'm only one person.
If they catch you, the whole world is in danger.
I'm gonna get you out of here, and if not, I've got a backup plan.
What is it?
Remember how I told you that the Necrotons are biodegradable.
They can only last on Earth for 24 hours, and after that, well, bing!
And by my calculations, they only have a few minutes left.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well, all we have to do is just stall.
Hiya, toots.
Hiya, boots.
Well, I see my plan worked.
I am executive timber.
I hope you get executive termites.
Not nice.
All right.
I surrender.
Let Mindy go.
Ha!
Not a chance.
But we made a bargain.
So sue me.
There's something so nice about omnipotence.
Ew!
What's wrong with him?
Uh, he's He's got something caught in his throat, and he'll die unless you help him.
Oh, I need his brain.
I better cut his head off.
Oh Oh, I don't know what you did, but you saved me.
Enough of your cheap Orkan tricks.
Now, get in the cage before I forget I'm a lady.
Uh, all right.
I didn't want to do this, but according to cosmic rules, and those dictated by Prime Minister Fluffy, I hereby challenge you to a holotecker.
Ha!
Sissy stuff.
I mean, if you really want a duel, let's go all the way.
The Battle of the Rose.
Uh-uh.
Not the Battle of the Rose.
What's the Battle of the Rose?
The greatest mental challenge in the universe, Min.
Those with the strongest will get to keep the rose.
This will be easier than Bobbing for Martians.
All right, who starts?
I'll flip you for it.
Whoa!
Ugh!
Captain Nirvana seems to have won the toss.
He has elected to receive.
It's time to begin the game with a play-by-play now.
Five yards this way.
Good luck to the both of you.
Ha-ha!
You're pretty hot stuff, but I won.
I've got the rose.
Ha-ha!
But I won.
You're out of air and time.
Four, three, two, one.
Ha-ha!
You're gone.
AdiÃ³s.
Huevos rancheros, albÃ³ndigas, and anon.
What are you talking about?
Well, you should have deteriorated, but You're still here.
You only had 24 hours.
Oh, those were Necroton hours.
Oh, excuse me.
Roughly how long is that on Earth?
Nine hundred years.
Boy, if I'd known that, I would have paced myself.
Oh, come on, Min.
Cheer up.
Hey, I'll give you a ride.
It was only a girl In a gilded cage Mork.
Sorry, Min.
Stop trying to cheer me up.
Yeah, I know.
It's kind of hard to frolic in the face of doom.
You know, I've been thinking about all the things that have happened to me since I've met you.
Well, one thing for sure, I never thought I'd end up sitting in a birdcage waiting for my brains to be sucked out by Necrotons.
Well, look on the bright side.
You still have your health.
Mork, you know, you You didn't have to come back and risk your life to save me, but you did.
Thanks.
Yeah, but I kind of botched up.
Because if I'd done the right thing, you'd be safe in your own home when they destroyed the Earth.
I guess we've had a full life.
I only wish I had gotten to meet Anson Williams.
Mork, there's something that I've been wanting to tell you for a long time, but I just couldn't.
Oh, what is it, Min?
Well, one time when you weren't home, I put on your spacesuit.
The helmet too?
Boots and all.
Are you mad?
No.
I have a confession to make to you too.
Well, one time when you weren't home, I held your blow dryer and jumped up and down on your bed.
Are you mad?
No.
I guess we've done it all.
Okay, Morky, it's time to get your brain sucked.
Oh!
Goodbye, Mork.
Goodbye, brains.
Hello, Larry.
Yaddy-yaddy, warden!
Oh, Mork!
Top of the world, Min!
Top of the world, Mindy!
Oh.
Is this thing gonna hurt?
Oh, no.
I won't feel a thing.
No, no.
I meant me.
Well, you tremendously.
Oh.
Comfy?
What?
It would have been easier if you'd talked.
But since we can't trust you, we'll have to take out your brain and squeeze out the information.
What?
Sutra.
Activate the extractor.
All right, I'll take it from here.
Prepare the ship for takeoff.
And check to see if the cookies are done.
Oh, Mork, Mork.
Boxing have been good to me, Howard.
Oh!
It's too late.
Oh!
It's not in there.
I think it in my ear.
Whew!
Uh, that was close.
Oh, I'm so glad you're all right.
Well, I I thought you wanted to suck out my brains, put them in that little jar over there for the winter.
Oh, no, Mork.
That was just to pretend for those two Those two barracudas.
You see, ever since I danced the tango with you, well, Well, I felt something I never felt before.
What was that?
Lack of hate.
Well, you know what they say.
"Lack of hate is a many splendored thing".
Oh, Mork, Mork.
If anyone on my planet knew what I was feeling now, well, I'd be vaporized.
But, somehow, ever since I met you, I've discovered there's a woman inside of me.
Oh, yes.
I can see where she's hiding.
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Why?
Oh, why?
Why do you have such power over me?
I do?
Yes.
My life used to be so simple.
Up at 9, maim, torture, mutilate, and then a light supper and curl up with a good book.
But now, now I have to have you.
I want to take you home with me.
You'll be my slave.
Oh, we'll have such fun together.
Ooh!
Well, we really can't.
We can't?
What could be more important than being my slave?
My friendship for Mindy.
You mean, you would pass up cosmic euphoria for that That thing scratching around in the cage?
You got it.
Maybe you'll feel differently after I put your pet to sleep.
Now, Nirvana, don't do anything rash.
Mork, you still have your brain!
That's the good news.
There's some bad news you don't want to hear right now.
Listen, can we talk about this, maybe discuss it?
No.
We Necrotons have a saying: "If an enemy gets in your way, you just needlepoint a sampler out of their hair".
Oh, you're a real homebody, you know that?
Mm-hm.
But since I don't have time to do all of that, I'll just part her hair down to her toes.
What did she say?
Oh It's just kind of girl talk, Min.
Something about split ends.
Listen, if you hurt her, you'll break my heart.
Oh, you can have one of mine.
I have three.
All right, pet.
You have littered your last cage.
If you come near me, I'll I'll poke you with my perch.
No, no!
No, no!
Now, listen.
If you hurt her, you'll never, ever be my friend.
Oh, you'll forget about her.
No.
You never forget about a friend, even when they're gone.
Oh, I don't know what I'm feeling.
No matter what I do, I can't win.
You are driving me crazy!
Mork, I think she wants to be a little more than just friends.
I don't care what you call it.
If I can't have him, no one can!
Whoa!
Oh.
It's a strange way of showing affection, Min.
It's time for slicing and dicing.
No, no.
Not so fast, Captain Ferrucci!
Ha-ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Ow!
Ow!
Ha!
You missed the whole galaxy.
Really?
I warn you.
I am the best swordsman in all of Ork.
Ow!
Ooh!
Ho-ho-ho.
Well, I never actually faced a person.
: But I am undefeated at capes and pictures.
Oh.
I can't do it.
You win.
I win?
Oh, what did I do?
I'll make a deal with you.
Mork, you can't trust her.
Oh, go peck your cuttlebone.
Listen, I'll set your pet free.
I'll I'll say in my report that the Earth was uninhabitable, if only you'll come back and be my mate.
Oh, that's a wonderful offer.
Can I sleep on that?
Okay, okay.
We'll go back and you'll be the master.
I'll be your slave.
We've heard enough.
Drop your sword.
Don't point that thing at me.
I'm your captain.
Our ex-captain.
Filing false reports, that's treason.
We're going to vaporize you and take the two specimens home with us.
We will be heroes.
See?
I told you they wanted my job.
Traitors deserve to suffer.
I think we'll crush her slowly with the Necroton death hug.
Ooh!
Gee, that always wrinkles my clothes.
Let's just vaporize her.
Hey, you with the death ray.
You've got a split in your tights.
Okay, ladies, put your hands up.
Don't worry.
She can't shoot.
She doesn't know the firing sequence.
Quick!
The death hug.
No, no, no!
Don't harm her!
Aah!
Oh!
Oh.
Ahh, ha-ha-ha.
Whoo!
Oh!
I think I must have found the sequence.
Okay, gang, reach for Mars.
No.
I mean, up with your hands!
Mork, not you!
No!
!
Not you, you!
No!
Not you, them!
No, you Mork!
Mork!
Mindy No, Mindy.
She's with me, me, me, me, me.
Okay, open the door.
Get out, pet.
I'm not a pet.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Get in, goons.
Oh, Mind.
Oh, we did it!
You know, I still don't understand.
I tortured you, I put you in a cage, and And yet you helped me, and, Mork, you saved my life.
Well, what else would a friend do?
I don't know.
I never had any.
Are you gonna let us go?
Sure.
You got the gun.
Mork.
Mind.
Here.
We have more with our friendship than could ever be destroyed by any gun.
Now will you let us go?
Do I have to?
A friend would.
You guys sure play rough.
This time I had my eyes closed.
Yeah, me too.
Well, goodbye, Nirvana.
Next time you come to this planet, I won't hide.
Oh, what are you gonna do with Kama and Sutra?
I'm gonna try to teach them what you taught me, but if that doesn't work, I think I'll have them stuffed.
Wait!
W-when you have friends, does it hurt when they leave you?
Yes.
Well, then, I guess I've found some real friends.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson!
Come out, come out wherever you are.
Olly, olly fats in free!
Mork!
Yeah.
I'm relieved to see you're in one piece.
Well, sir, what did you expect to see me in, a bikini, your Harper's Bazaarness?
Ar-ar.
Congratulations on once again surviving the attack of the Necroton.
Well, sir, this has been a week to end all weeks.
I'm not kidding you.
Now that it's over, have you any special observations to report?
You must remember this: That a kiss is still a kiss, and a sigh is just a sigh.
And on Earth, friendship is as contagious as the flu.
Are you sure?
Well, it must be, sir.
I mean, I caught it from Mindy, then I gave it to Nirvana, captain of the Necrotons.
You gave it away?
Well, I got it right back.
I mean, that's the funny thing about friendship.
It's like a boomerang!
It comes right back at you.
Bam!
But you wasted it on a Necroton, our enemy.
Well, but now we have one less enemy.
There's plenty more Necrotons where she came from, Mork.
Oh, but, sir, how about this for a plan?
Tell you what.
If everybody makes two friends and those two friends make two more friends, and two more friends, and Yeah!
Out to infinity, pretty soon, we'll all be flying the friendly skies and united.
Until next week, sir.
Nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Nanu, nanu!
Hey, Nelson, have you ever thought of taking a stand on the ERA?
I don't think I should get involved with Irish revolutionaries.
That's the IRA.
Don't you guys from Boulder ever read the newspapers?
Everybody knows ERA is "earned run average".
You know, maybe you two should be running mates.
Uh, hello, Nelson.
Hi, Min.
Hi.
I suppose you'd like to know why I'm walking backwards.
No.
No, I'm sure you have your reasons.
I'd like to know.
Well, I I lost another job, and I can't face Mind.
Oh, Mork!
I thought things were going really great at the pet store.
Well, they were, but I wanted to have kind of a gestalt pet shop, so I put all the animals together.
Well, I guess that was a mistake, huh?
You can't imagine the sight of seeing a little chimpanzee trying to peel a goldfish like a banana.
Well, I hope you took it away from the chimp.
I didn't have to.
He drowned.
It's dead?
No, no.
I gave him artificial respiration, and he gave me his phone number.
Now, I've made a new friend but lost a job.
Well, you can have a non-paying job right here helping us come up with a platform for Nelson.
I don't believe it!
God's been reading my mind!
I don't think so.
They're wearing clothes.
Why don't you go over there and talk to your friends?
Hello, ladies!
Water's free.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Gee, I wonder where all these beautiful girls came from.
Maybe there's a slow leak at the Playboy Club.
I didn't know Liberace had any children.
Actually, we're the Denver Bronco cheerleaders, the Pony Express.
Hello.
My name is Mork.
Nanu, and what do you do?
We dance at the football games.
Oh, what's the matter?
You can't get into Studio 54?
I saw all of you on last Sunday's game.
You were great.
Oh, yeah, you were wonderful.
So were the Broncos.
They won.
They did?
I didn't notice that, but you did a good job, and you were all very good.
Your job is to cheer people up?
Not always.
Today we're here to do a charity benefit.
You know, I'm pretty good at cheering people up.
Hey, let's pretend you're all depressed, okay?
Pretend the Ayatollah Khomeini has just bought Disneyland.
And Minnie Mouse has to wear a big veil.
All right.
First, I'd like to do a few impressions for you.
Like to do a few impressions.
Here we go.
My first impression is a California surfer watching a total eclipse.
Wow, that's really mellow.
My next impression is King Kong in Las Vegas.
Put me down, put me down!
My final impression I think you'll really enjoy is Truman Capote as an NFL quarterback.
It's gonna be an awfully long day.
That's pretty good.
If you learned a few dance steps, you could be a cheerleader.
I think it's a great idea.
Except that all professional cheerleaders are women.
You know, I don't think there's any law about that.
Why don't you fill out an application at Bronco headquarters?
Whoa!
Tell you what.
I think I will.
If things go right and I get this job, I promise you, I'll personally spit shine each and every one of those little spangle things.
Excuse me.
One question.
How many chandeliers died to make those costumes?
When you dance, do you signal low-flying planes?
Oh, a diaper.
Mindy's seeing a younger man.
And he's got a drinking problem.
Sally brought her baby over yesterday.
You expect me to believe that ridiculous story?
!
Right.
I was a fool to think you'd fall for it.
Right.
Why did you move my furniture all around?
Kathy and Ann are coming over to teach me crowd excitation stimulation.
What?
Cheerleading to the laywoman.
Mork, I really wonder if you thought this thing through.
Sure I have.
Haven't I?
Well, if you get the job, understand the social ramifications.
Well, I know about ramifications.
That's why Mary had a little lamb.
No.
See, a lot of people might make fun of you.
No, they made fun of me when I was walking backwards for two miles.
Okay, I just You know, I mean, I'll back you no matter what you wanna do.
I just don't wanna see you get hurt.
Men and women should be allowed to do anything they want.
I mean, look, nowadays, there's women astronauts and women lawyers.
Women mothers.
Right, Mork.
Actually, what you're doing is very courageous, and it could just help the women's movement.
Well, all I wanna do, Mindy, is make Susan B. Anthony stand up and cheer.
Susan B. Anthony is dead.
No wonder she looks so bad on that little dollar.
Oh, come on in.
It's open.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, no!
Exploding habigines!
Get rid of them!
Aah, quick!
They didn't explode.
Heh-heh.
They were tired.
I guess it was their mating season.
Mork is, uh, rehearsing for a play that he's in.
It's called The Attack of the Exploding Habigines.
Uh, it's by Chekhov.
Really?
I'm a literature teacher, and I've never heard of it.
It's a very loose translation.
You probably know it as Oklahoma!
.
Oh.
You're a cheerleader and a lit teacher, huh?
I'm a lit teacher and a cheerleader.
And Kathy's a law student.
Really?
I thought jumping on a football field was a full-time profession.
Are you kidding?
We only get paid $15 a game.
We just do it for the fun and excitement.
Anyway, there's a lot more to it than just jumping up and down.
It includes gymnastics, dance, and lots of rehearsal.
Sounds like you have to be an all-around athlete.
Oh, come on, Mind.
If that was true, they'd roll right off the field.
Ar-ar.
Why don't we get started?
We'll start with some warm-up exercises.
We've got a week to teach you the routine.
Oh!
I'll get you your medication.
It's okay.
Wait.
Let's try the bike exercise, okay?
All right.
Mork, you're not riding the bike.
I am.
Mine's a moped.
Hi there, happy faces.
Hi, Nelson.
You look happy.
You get lucky?
No, I got an idea.
Oh, you came up with a platform?
No, nary a plank.
Who needs a platform when I'm going to be on national television?
The Gong Show answered your letter!
Hardy-har-har.
You know the Kennedy-Carter debates?
Well, I've volunteered to debate with them.
Uh, Nelson, you can't debate with Kennedy and Carter.
You see, they're running for president and you're running for city council.
So what?
We all put our pants on the same way.
If I can humiliate them on national television, I'll go down in history books.
You'll go down in comic books.
Mind.
Mind, you'll never guess where I've been.
Uh, to Denver to file an application with the Pony Express.
Wow.
Another incredible psychic occurrence.
Well, I filled out a few applications, answered a few questions.
That's it?
Well, yeah.
The woman said she'd make me a deal: If I won't call her, she won't call me.
Mork, that means they're not even gonna let you try out.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Did they say anything else?
Well, she said, "This is one pony express that carries no male".
That's sex discrimination.
That's terrible.
That's illegal.
That's wonderful.
Don't you see?
Sex discrimination, that's a great platform.
I could get media coverage like that.
Who needs Kennedy and Carter when I've got sex?
Well, how is that gonna help Mork, Nelson?
Are we not Americans?
Are we not free to pursue the job of our choice regardless of race, creed, color, or sex?
And if one of my countrymen wants to shake his pom-pom, I, Nelson Flavor, will defend his right to the death.
Sorry, Min.
I don't know why you want that job.
I mean, a real man just doesn't do girlie things.
Try and tell that to Roosevelt Grier as he needlepoints on your nose.
I will go ahead.
With Mindy's help, I'm gonna break down every sexual barrier that there is.
Me?
What can I do?
Well, once I get through this, I'm gonna make you the first female quarterback.
Watch how long the counts will be then.
These are cheerleaders?
Boy, things sure have changed since I've gone to prep school.
I mean, how can you be a cheerleader without a baggy sweater and knee socks?
I don't know, but that last move really cheered me up.
Will you guys stop staring?
They're just a bunch of girls.
Does my hair look all right?
Thank you, Kim.
That was excellent.
You're on the team again this year.
Thanks, Pam.
It's good to be back.
I'd like to see her in a baggy sweater.
I'd like to see her in a kangaroo suit.
Wah-ah-ah-ah!
Hi.
My name's Peggy Black, and I'd like to do a cheer for you.
Give me a B-U-N.
Give me a C-O-S.
What does that spell?
Buncos?
Uh, thank you, Peggy.
We'll be in touch.
I thought you were very good.
Hi, Mork.
Pam, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Mork, this is Pam Stockhaus, the manager of the Pony Express.
Nanu.
I'm Mindy McConnell and this is my cousin, Nelson Flavor.
The Nelson Flavor who was on the news last night and called me a sexist?
Yes.
Glad to know you.
The Nelson Flavor who threatened to take us to the United Nations if we didn't let his man try out?
That's me.
Mr. Flavor, I am not a sexist.
I discriminate against no one except tall, blond politicians.
Well, that could be a lot of people.
Look, Pam, I know you're mad at Nelson, and you probably should be.
He does get carried away now and then.
But let's not lose sight of what's really at stake here.
We're talking about equal rights.
Mork just wants a chance to try out for the job.
So I heard on the news.
Every channel.
Well, he's been practicing really hard with your squad.
I mean, if he's no good, fine, but he should at least have the chance to try.
Oh, okay.
It's against my better judgment, but I suppose it won't hurt to look.
You're on, Mork.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Um  Two, four, 6.8.
We'll send your team home in a crate.
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two.
That's all, folks.
Nanu, nanu.
That was real nice work.
We'll let you know.
Thanks.
Wait a minute.
Mork was great.
You should let him know right now if he's on the team.
Okay.
If you wanna What we have here is a flagrant case of discrimination.
If I may cite the case of "Tiny" Jane Whitman v. The Lubbock, Texas Little League If I could just finish.
I was trying to say yes, you're on the squad.
Mork, your first game is on Sunday.
Now, you're gonna have to practice every day.
You've got a lot of routines to learn.
And remember, Mork, no special privileges.
Oh, no, he's not looking for any special privileges.
Well, the problem is, Mindy, we don't have the facilities to take care of a male cheerleader.
You're gonna have to dress in the locker room with the squad.
I want total equality.
When they jump, I'll jump.
When they change, I'll change.
When they shower, I'll shower.
That isn't equality.
That's ecstasy.
Standby.
You're on.
This is Stu Scully, in the locker room of the famed Denver Bronco cheerleaders, the Pony Express.
With me, Pam Stockhaus, their manager, and a few of the girls.
Pam, I understand this is an important game for you.
Oh, that's right, Stu.
This afternoon, Denver will get an eyeful of pro football's first male cheerleader.
What a cataclysmic event in the annals of football history.
His name is Mork.
And who would have thought that one day we would see a male cheerleader standing here in the Pony Express locker room?
But right now let's have a random sampling.
Hi, Stu Scully.
I wonder if you ladies would tell me what it's like to have a man on the team.
Well, he's got a great pair of legs.
CHEERLEADER 2: And he's really become one of the girls.
Thank you.
Miss Stockhaus, what is your reaction to accusations in the press of sexploitation?
Stu, for the rest of the season, we plan to keep Mork barefoot and pregnant.
I wonder if I might have a word with your new star.
Uh, well, we have three locker rooms, and I'm not sure which one he's in.
Sorry we're late, Pam.
We'll be right back.
Okay.
Would say Mork is just a regular guy?
I'd say  I think we found him.
Hi.
Stu Scully, Denver Action News Team.
I wonder if you'd mind answering a few questions for our viewers out there.
Oh, sure.
Hi, Mind.
Hi, Nelson.
Orson, who knew?
Nanu.
Ar-ar.
Heh.
All you have to do is relax, speak your mind.
Well, sure.
I've seen a lot of these on television.
I know how to handle these interviews.
Mork, how is it that a man can break the sexual barriers of pro cheerleading?
We've got a good ball team here, Stu.
A good ball club.
Right.
But, tell me, do the girls treat you any differently than they would, say, a female member of the team?
We've got a good ball team here, Stu.
A good ball club.
Stu, can you turn that off for a second?
I-I'm really scared.
I mean, I'm getting little butterflies in my knees.
Know what I mean?
Mork, the girls would like you to say a little something before we go out on the field.
Come on, girls.
Come on.
Come on in.
Now that we're all gathered together, girls, I know we're in first place, but, hey, big deal.
All that means is every other cheerleading squad in the league is after our hemlines.
Hatfield.
Hatfield, I know the press has been rough on you.
They say you're on your last leap.
But, hey, who believes the Enquirer anyway?
Come on, now.
Sassoon, Sassoon, Sassoon.
Okay.
Keep in mind the phrase of that famous cheerleader, Boom Boom La Rue when she said: "Good girls don't get to Paris".
I want you to go out there and win this one for the zipper!
Now, come on, everybody get in the middle.
Pitch in!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
All right, let's go, let's go!
Hi, everybody.
Nelson Flavor.
Hello.
I'm Mork's friend.
Hi.
I'm the guy that brought him here.
I'm Mork's friend.
Yes, I am.
Vote for me, Flavor!
Nelson Flavor.
Sure is a big day, Mindy.
The Denver Broncos are proud to present the Pony Express and its newest member, pro football's first male cheerleader, Mork.
Ooh, won't be long now.
And here they are, the Pony Express.
Go get 'em, Mork.
That's my boy.
Yay, Mork!
Yay, Mork!
CROWD : We want Mork!
We want Mork!
We want Mork!
We want Mork!
I'm sorry, folks.
It looks as though Mork has changed his mind.
Mork, where are you going?
Mork?
Wait up.
CROWD : We want Mork!
Mork?
Where are you?
The crowd is calling for you.
I'm in here.
Which one?
I don't know.
The number's on the outside.
Am I angry?
Sure.
Hey, I realize it's not easy for a guy to go out in front of 73,144 people in a halter.
But you squelched my chance at greatness.
Nelson, leave him alone.
I'm sure he feels bad enough already.
Ah, it's probably my fault.
The Democrats have a donkey.
The Republicans have an elephant.
I had to pick a guy in a skirt.
Where is he anyway?
Try 1045.
Mork, it's me, Mind.
Why don't you come out?
Be right down.
I'm upstairs.
Mork.
I'd ask you in, Min, but the place is a mess.
Mork, come out of there.
What happened out there?
I don't know.
Felt all right when I ran on the field.
All of a sudden, I looked up and I saw thousands of orange faces.
Mm.
And then I felt kind of ridiculous.
Then I guess I got chicken apples.
I think it's called stage fright, Mork.
Actually, it's called Orkan law, Mind.
We're not allowed to have meetings of more than six people.
Why not?
Well, the seventh one gets stage fright.
Well, I'll tell you something, Mork.
I don't think I would have had enough nerve to go out there in front of all those people.
Really?
Mm-mm.
I really don't.
But look at it this way.
Even though it didn't work out, at least you had the nerve to go out and try something you really wanted to do.
A lot of people never even do that.
So you're not a failure 'cause you ran off the field.
You're a success because you ran on.
Oh.
Thanks, Min.
You made me feel better.
Good.
Now, why don't you change your clothes, and I'll buy you lunch.
But can we not go out that way?
Oh, yeah.
The crowd, right?
No, no.
It's a linebacker, "No Neck" Nedboy.
When I ran out on the field, he winked at me.
He did?
Okay.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Give me an F. Give me an A. Give me a T. Give me an S. Give me an O. What's that spell?
Mork!
Sir, I was just thinking about you.
What are you doing?
Well, I was cheering up, you pom-pomposity.
It's something I learned on my new job this week.
I joined a squad of lady cheerleaders.
How did you pass as a woman, Mork?
Well, I lied about my height, sir.
Ar.
You see, sir, everything here on Earth is divided by sexes.
There's men's fashions, women's fashions.
There's boy talk, girl talk.
Stenographers, dictators.
Do Earthlings always separate the men from the women?
Oh, yes, sir.
They even have his and her towels.
But the real difficulty comes when they try and separate the men's jobs from the women's jobs.
Why do they do that?
Maybe it's a question of quality.
Oh, no, sir.
I think it's a question of equality.
You see, when you're dealing with people, it's hard to tell the value of the merchandise by looking at the shape of the package.
I can paraphrase that and say, that sometimes the best man for a job is a woman.
And in your case, Mork, the best woman for the job was you?
Well, sir, I gave it a shot, but You know, sir, after centuries, these humans have tried so hard to prove that all men are created equal.
It's kind of nice to know that they're still working at it.
And on that positive note, that's all there is, there ain't no more.
This is little Mork signing off from the planet Earth.
Nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Nanu, nanu.
Yes, Frank, I know you're the editor of the school newspaper, but I can't write this article.
Because I think it's stupid.
"Feminism: Myth or Myth-ith"?
Okay, we will talk about it tomorrow.
All right.
Bye.
Hi.
It was a simple misunderstanding.
What?
They told me not to talk about it, but You know, I have one thing to say, right here and now: That goat was already dead.
I don't want to hear about this.
Smart girl.
It'll blow over in a year or two.
If anybody up there is listening, please save me from this insanity.
Hi, there, curly lips.
No one was listening.
Exidor.
Mork.
Is that you?
Who wants to know?
Mrs. Exidor's future husband.
I don't believe this.
Mork.
I'm glad you dropped by.
Exidor, why don't you sit down and take a load off your dock waders?
All that rubber must get irritating sometimes.
What's this I hear about a Mrs. Exidor?
Oh, Mork, I'm so excited.
I just Pepe, you sit under me one more time, and you've sucked your last margarita.
Now, then, where was I?
Ah, yes.
Her name is Ambrosia Malspar.
Of the Hogsbreath Gulch Malspars.
Oh, I've heard of them.
I thought they were all caught.
From the moment we met, I heard bells.
Oh, she's a prizefighter, eh?
A romantic, you're not.
I dropped by so I could invite you two to dinner tonight so you can meet Ambrosia.
Are you free?
Uh, I don't think that we could Oh, of course we are.
Mork, I don't care to meet an invisible fiancÃ©e.
Mindy, how long could it take?
Where should we meet?
Here.
Say, about 8?
You're picking us up?
No, no, no.
We'll eat here.
Ooh, that's real convenient, Min.
We don't have to make reservations.
You expect me I'm supposed to Oh, please, don't worry about feeding Pepe.
Tonight's his jai alai tournament.
Ha, ha, ha.
Mind, I'm real proud of you.
I know sometimes you think that Exidor is a twit, but yet you overcame your hang-ups, and you invited he and his fiancÃ©e over here for dinner.
You're a credit to shiksadom.
Mork Min?
Stuff it.
I'm sensing a lot of hostility, Min.
What's bothering and tickling your little innards?
What's up?
Okay you, Exidor, and Ambrosia.
Ooh, good, I'm glad you got that off your chest.
Now, did you make that clam dip?
I'm not finished yet.
EstÃ¡ mÃ¡s?
Mas, mas more.
I resent Exidor inviting himself for dinner, almost as much as I resent having to cook dinner for an invisible fiancÃ©e.
I mean, we're into the foothills of kinky here.
Have you ever considered that Exidor's fiancÃ©e might be a real flesh-and-blood woman?
No.
Me neither.
Come on, Mind, I mean, Exidor means well.
If this will make him happy, let him have his moment.
I mean, people in robes have so few.
The lovebirds are here right now.
We'll be right with you, loverisms.
Mind, I want you to be nice to Exidor, and try not to stare at Ambrosia.
Mindy, it's Exidor.
And guess who's with him.
You must be Ambrosia.
You're you're everything I imagined.
I like your dress.
Who are you talking to?
I'm talking to the lovely Ambrosia.
But there's nobody there.
I think the little lady has been smoking her braids again.
I mean, you don't see anybody here, do you?
Not me.
Thanks a lot.
Now he thinks I'm the one that's crazy?
Oh, I didn't say that.
I just said your oil wasn't touching the dipstick.
Did you or did you not state that you were bringing your fiancÃ©e here to dinner tonight?
Methinks I hear her dainty step upon the stair.
And this is my beloved All right, that's it.
The party is over.
Gee, I'm sorry I missed it.
Mork, Mindy I would like you to meet Ambrosia Malspar.
She's over here, Min.
I see her.
May I sit down?
Oh.
Yeah, sure.
Come on in.
I'm sorry.
It's about time.
Be gentle with her.
She could use a little Hamburger Helper.
Don't worry.
Your kind of problem doesn't carry the stigma it used to.
Stigma?
So, Mork, you're Exidor's best friend.
Tell me about yourself.
Well, I guess you can kind of call me a son of a black hole.
Heh.
I'm, well, you know, my mom was a Petri dish, my dad was an eyedropper.
Heh.
Kind of a cosmic clone.
Just to double-check Mindy's the one with the problems?
So, how did you two lovebirds meet?
She chalked me.
Excuse me?
Oh, this must be something of the new sexual revolution.
Oh, no, I don't think so.
You see, I'm a meter maid, and I was just minding my own business, just riding on my motor scooter, chalking tires, and Exy was lying on his back in the street fixing his burro.
I bet the hard part was jacking him up, right?
And I accidentally chalked his boots.
Oh, um, why don't we all have some, uh, cheese hors d'oeuvres before dinner?
Tell you what.
I'll take the d'oeuvres.
Ar, ar.
You two take your time.
Amby and I will just sit here and make little fishy faces at one another.
I just can't get over it.
I mean, she's real, and she seems perfectly normal.
Unless she's a hologram.
Look at her.
She she's nice, she's charming, and she's sane.
I mean, she's nothing like Exidor.
I'll bet she's gonna be good for him.
Look, even tonight, he's acting relatively normal.
Stop that pounding.
We're not deaf.
Hold that thought.
I'll get it.
Stop that pounding.
I'm coming.
What are you doing here?
Who is it, sweetheart?
It's Pepe.
It's Pepe?
Looks like Pepe to me.
No, it can't be Pepe.
Pepe's playing jai alai tonight.
What am I saying?
Exidor, it can't be Pepe.
Mork, Mindy, I know you're trying to protect Exidor, but it's as plain as the nose on your face what's going on, especially when Pepe's standing right there.
He is?
Exidor, you promised me Pepe wouldn't be here tonight.
But, guppy lips Why can't we ever be alone?
Why does he always have to tag along?
You said you wanted to light my fire, but three on a match is too much.
But, flamingo toes.
Pepe, you stay right here.
Don't you dare follow us.
I don't want to talk about it.
I'm going to bed for a week.
Who is it?
Oh, he's in muscatel heaven.
Thanks for the ride, boys.
Come on in, Exidor.
Why don't you sit down?
What's wrong?
I'll tell you what's wrong.
Ambrosia dumped me.
She said she wouldn't marry me if I was the last prophet on earth, which I am.
Well, I'm sorry to hear about that.
One day you'll meet a girl right for you in every way.
Do you really think so?
No, but at least you had hope for a moment.
Thanks, Mork.
I just dropped by to say adios.
I'm shuffling off this mortal coil, and I want you to have all my worldly possessions.
Here.
Oh, thank you.
That's won It's empty.
Of course.
That suitcase is all my worldly possessions.
Except for a large rock, and I'm saving that for transportation.
You're saving a rock for transportation?
Yes.
I'm going to tie it to my leg when I go on vacation.
In Atlantis.
Oh, come on now, Exidor.
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna spend the night here.
And I guarantee, tomorrow morning, things will look a lot better.
But what if they don't?
Well, you'll have to stay here until they do, that may take forever, that's all right.
Mork.
Min.
It's settled.
Here we go, Exidor.
Time to hit the sack.
A little mondo do-do.
Here we go.
Oh, this is very kind of you both.
You won't even know I'm here.
Good night.
Good night.
Mork, he's baying.
Of course, Min, it's a full moon.
So, then what happens, the alpha says to the beta, "The muzzle, take it off.
I wanna kiss her".
The alpha said, "why, are we nailed to a chicken"?
Ar, ar, ar.
That's wildly hysterical, Mork, but I'm empty.
My life is over.
I'm going out and kiss my burro goodbye.
Oh, no, you can't do that.
Where is the old Exidor spirit?
Locked up in Ambrosia's cold, cold heart.
Will you kindly take your boots off my sofa?
Whoa, whoa, Mind.
He's got squatter's rights.
You gotta show some compassion, this man's on the ragged edge.
If you two don't mind, I think I'll take a little hike upstairs to Mork's lake.
The leaves are changing, you know?
They just drop off, shrivel up, and die.
It's hard to keep from laughing.
That is it, Mork.
He's gotta go or I'm gonna end up as looney tunes as he is.
Come on, Mind, you gotta help him.
You can't discard him like an old Carter cabinet member.
You're right, I can't.
But I can try to get Ambrosia to take him back.
Oh, come on, Ambrosia, why don't you tell me why you really broke up with Exidor.
I'd rather not discuss it, Mindy.
Well, you shouldn't just let him go.
Exidor is a very unique person.
I mean, when they dropped Exidor, they broke the mold.
They sure did.
He's kind, considerate, a snappy dresser.
And let's not forget that swell sense of humor.
Well, then, why did you break up with him?
Well It's that friend of his, Pepe.
He won't leave us alone.
We go to the swap meet, there's Pepe.
We go skateboarding, there's Pepe.
Tailgating.
Sometimes I wish he'd just disappear.
Um What what exactly does Pepe look like?
I don't know.
You'd have to ask Exidor.
Then, you know that Pepe doesn't exist?
Well, I wouldn't say that.
A lot of people believe in men from outer space.
I've never seen one, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.
Good point.
Exidor sees Pepe, and he's never lied to me yet.
Besides, you have to believe in the man you love.
You know, you're a very special person, Ambrosia.
No, I'm not, because I haven't been totally honest with you or Exidor.
Pepe isn't the real problem.
He's not?
No.
I'm old-fashioned.
Before a couple gets married, I believe the man should ask the woman to marry him.
Well, what if Exidor did propose to you?
Would you marry him then?
No.
Why not?
Mindy he's never told me he loves me.
What are you doing?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm drowning in your lake.
Now get out of here and let me sink in peace.
But I've got great news.
Ambrosia wants you back.
Ambrosia wants me back?
Save me.
Save me.
Wait.
Wait.
You can't.
You'll drown.
What do I do?
Quick, grab my dinghy.
All right.
Just tread rug.
I'll be right there.
Here.
A life preserver.
Hold onto that.
Hurry.
Hurry.
A grouper's got me by the leg.
Oh, yes.
Whoa.
Plucked from a watery grave.
Tell me, when can I see my fox?
Well, she's coming tonight, you have to do is one thing, and she'll take you back.
Anything.
Name it.
All you have to do is say.
"I love you.
Will you marry me"?
That's it, back to catfish country.
No, no, wait, wait.
I thought you loved Ambrosia.
I do.
Then why can't you tell her?
Mork, this may come as a bit of a surprise, but I am just a little eccentric.
No.
You see, Mork, I just can't get myself to say that phrase.
In the orphanage where I was raised, nobody ever said it to me.
You've got to.
It's for your own happiness.
But you don't understand.
It's a psychological problem.
Everyone's allowed one little hang-up.
There she is.
I can't say it.
If you don't, you're gonna lose her.
Now, remember: "I love you".
That's really nice, but what are we gonna do about Ambrosia?
Hi, Ambrosia.
Hi, Mindy.
Let me go.
I can't.
No, don't grab me there.
Is Exidor here?
Um, I don't know.
I'll check.
Mork.
We have company.
Mind.
Be right down.
Get down there.
I think that they're probably freshening up a bit.
Exy won't go anywhere unless he's just so.
No, I won't go.
Oh.
Hi, there, dimple hips.
Hi, Exy.
Does Exidor have something he wants to say to Ambrosia?
Do you have something you want to say to Ambrosia?
Can't think of anything.
Think again.
You can do it.
Ihave something I want to say.
I I It's impossible, I can't.
My life is over.
Oh, I got a good idea.
Let's play charades.
Charades?
Well, you see, Exidor has trouble communicating with h-e-r.
I love to play charades.
Exidor, you be the giver.
You be the receiver.
Exidor, go.
Hit it.
Uh Uh First word.
First word.
Eye.
I got it.
"I love you, and will you marry me"?
I thought she'd never get it.
The answer is, "I love you too, and you bet".
Oh, I can't believe it.
She loves me.
Exy, will you walk me home, alone?
Just a moment.
Pepe.
Them wedding bells have broken up that old gang of ours.
Hasta luego, amigo.
Thank you, sweetheart.
You're too good to me.
I'd do anything for you because I love you, and I want to marry you.
Twice in one night.
And there's a lot more where that came from.
Well, it took the both of us, but we pulled it off.
Hey, how about going to the deli with me?
I'll buy you a soda.
I still feel kind of strange about one thing.
What?
Well, I feel kind of sorry for Pepe.
I mean, where's he gonna get work with an invisible green card?
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, great super scooper in the sky.
Your report, Mork.
Oh, sir, I am so excited.
My best friend is getting married next week.
How long do marriages on earth last?
Oh, until death do they part or a quick trip to Reno, whichever comes first.
But I think Exidor's marriage is gonna last forever.
Exidor?
Isn't he the one you told me was strange, even by earth standards?
Ah, sir, with love, there are no standards.
You see, no matter how strange or bizarre you are there's always a certain someone who'll love you for it.
Love gives everyone a chance to be happy.
Chance?
You make it sound like a lottery.
Well, sir, in a way, love is a lottery.
And the only losers are the ones who won't gamble.
Exidor's marriage promises to be one of the most unusual in the history of mankind.
Don't be late, and don't come empty-handed.
Nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Nanu, nanu!
This is gonna be fun.
I haven't had home-cooked Chinese food since Uncle Chin Ho came to visit.
I didn't know you had an Oriental You don't?
It's a joke?
Yeah.
Ha-ha.
Oh, hi, Mork.
You're home early.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm back later.
Hello, Min.
Hi.
Hello, my little knish.
Well, Min, wish me bon voyage, bon chance, et bon appÃ©tit.
I'm on my way.
I wanna become a globetrotter.
Oh, you're too short and too pale.
No, no.
No, I wanna become a world traveler.
I mean, I'm talking jet-setter, one of the beautiful people.
I'm talking terminal Gucci, daiquiris at dawn.
Ah.
So that's what all those brochures are for, huh?
You bet your airfare.
The world's my oyster, I'm gonna pry that little sucker open, shell out a few clams, and go looking for my pearl.
Oh, yeah?
And where are you gonna dig up enough clams to be able to travel?
I'll write a book entitled, "How to Make $6 Million in a Month".
And I'll have to read it eventually, but Oh, listen.
I've also got a plan.
I'll sell spot remover.
Here's how it works.
Here, Spot, come here.
Mork, uh Oh, Min, look at the wonderful places I can go to, though.
Visit Tibet, and "Dalai" with the Lama.
Visit Moscow and see the future stars of the New York Ballet.
Visit Encino, home of rayon.
Why the sudden urge to travel?
Well, Min, I'm reading the news, and you know there's.
Bombing in Bombay, hey Chaos in Colombia Terrorism in Tehran I want to see the world Or what's left of it Today That makes sense.
Yeah.
Mm.
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo Boy, something smells real good.
When Remo comes, we'll have an authentic Chinese dinner.
Ah.
Uh-uh, no Peking.
Well, Min, I know.
I know you're hungry, and I want to travel.
Let's combine the two.
Like, we'll go to China.
I know this incredible kosher delicatessen in downtown Shanghai.
It's called "Haimy's".
We'll go there and have moo goo kreplach.
I'm afraid that still takes a little more money than you have, Mork.
You're right.
I haven't got enough to make it to the couch.
Well, I do, but I haven't got enough to get back.
Well, you know, there are ways of traveling without spending too much money.
Well, tell us, Miss Consumer Advocate.
Lay a few on me.
Well, there are clubs that give you discount rates.
And in some situations, you can even work off your passage.
Yeah.
I'll work my passage till it falls off.
Oh.
I can imagine myself on a boat right now.
I'll haul some keel.
I'll batten down those hatches.
I'll cheer up the stern, I'll drink some port and list to starboard.
Oh, nuts.
I forgot the bamboo chutes.
Okay.
Why don't I run down to the market and get some for you?
Tell you what.
I'll go with you.
I could use a little break from Morko Polo here.
We'll be back in about ten minutes, Morko.
Oh.
How'd you know I was here?
I didn't.
Wow, Noja vu.
Well, we're just gonna run to the store so dinner will be ready in about half an hour.
Remo, don't start without us.
ANNOUNCER : And it's the Patriots' ball now.
Johnson handing off Yo, Remo.
No time for niceties now.
I got ten bucks on this football game, and I can't watch it at home.
Why, is your TV broken?
No, it's got a slight case of beer bottle in the picture tube.
Yesterday's game.
I got the guy coming tomorrow to de-Schlitz it.
You got any beer?
No, I guess you'll just have to throw some wine.
Remo, I've got a problem.
I wanna travel.
Yeah, yeah.
Go!
Go!
Go!
That's easy for you to say, but how do you do it?
How do you do it without airfare?
Run, you meatball, run!
I don't think so.
I mean, China's a long way.
If the distance doesn't get you, the tariffs will.
The sharks Ah, timeout.
All right.
Come on, come on, come on!
All right, what I was trying to ask was how can you work and travel at the same time?
Do what I did.
Join the Air Force.
The Air Force?
Yeah, they don't pay you very much, but you get to see everywhere.
They pay you?
Oh, that's wonderful.
I gotta talk to them and join that club.
Yeah, you join up, the next thing you know, you're in the wild blue yonder.
If they send you to L.A., you're in the wild brown yonder.
Touchdown!
Ha-ha-ha!
Yea!
Whoa!
Yea!
Why are they spanking that guy?
They're not spanking him.
They're pattin' him.
That's congratulations.
You know, man stuff.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Snap to the center, here's the snap, the hold, kick It's good.
Extra point's good.
The Patriots are killing the Oilers.
It serves the Oilers right for charging more than a dollar for a gallon of gas.
Nah.
Slogan.
Air Force slogan.
"Do it in the clouds".
No.
I've got it!
"May the Air Force be with you".
Eeh-h-h-h.
Ugh.
I've got to come up with a recruiting slogan.
What was your old one?
The brass just didn't like my old one.
What was it?
"The Air Force isn't so bad".
Well, you convinced me.
I wanna join.
Yeah?
Yeah, I wanna walk on the wild side.
I wanna meet places and go people.
I can see it all now.
Playing tennis in Monaco.
Seeing Princess Grace going: : "Is my sister here"?
I'll goof-off in Guam.
All those things.
You sound like real officer material.
No, I don't want an office.
I just want an application form.
No, no, no.
I'm not a recruiter.
I'm a lieutenant in public relations.
Are they fun?
Oodles.
This is an Air Force base.
The recruiting office is in downtown Boulder.
Just bring them your birth certificate, driver's license and your social security card.
Well, the only card I got was from a guy downtown that said, "Live Lady Mud Wrestling.
Call Lumpy".
Well, You gotta have those things, or they're not gonna let you in.
: Won't they let me in just on my personality?
I can do an audition piece for them.
This is Blanche Dubois from A Streetcar Named Desire as Tonto.
: I've always been accustomed to the kindness of rangers.
I'm afraid not.
Oh.
You gotta let me in.
I wanna travel.
I wanna join your club.
Please.
Sorry.
Rules are rules.
I know that.
If you're gonna be snooty, you won't get any business.
Look, this is my lunch hour.
Why don't you take a couple of these pamphlets and read up on the Air Force?
But I'm telling you right now, they're not gonna let you in unless you have the right papers.
Even if I'm a hard worker?
I'm also a nice guy.
That's it!
The Air Force needs a few nice guys.
All I have to do is convince them that I'd be a lot of fun on one of their Air Force trips.
Up in the air Junior bird Eh.
I don't know.
Hey, hey, hey.
Ha-ha.
Heh-heh.
Ow.
I know what I can do.
I'll show them how good I look in one of their club costumes.
Oh, this is wonderful.
Oh, look.
And it comes with a little disco bag too.
Ooh!
I feel like Frosty the Snowman, only darker.
You guys want some coffee?
You call that brown stuff coffee?
You know, that green stuff we had for lunch today was worse than the green stuff we had last week.
Yeah, that's because last week it was Jell-O.
Today it's meatloaf.
Well, at least we won't have to worry about mess hall tonight.
I wonder where they're sending us.
Everything's so hush-hush.
Wherever it is, let's hope it's close to a McDonalds.
Give me five.
Hi, there, jet-setters.
Attention!
You're right.
No, there's too much tension as there is already.
Now, come on, let's relax, let's relax.
Send your shoulders down.
Here we go.
First of all, do a little of these.
Go, "Whoa".
Now let the shoulders go.
Let 'em go, let 'em go.
Relax.
Bad energy out!
Bad energy out!
There.
Now that we're relaxed, what's happening?
We're being mobilized, sir.
Oh, punctual me.
I'm right on time.
Do you know where we're going, sir?
I give up.
Where?
I think he's been at peace too long.
Well, I'm tired of being kept in the dark.
They never tell you anything.
I hate that.
You know what I hate?
I hate it when you always get that little piece of popcorn You eat it, and it gets way in the back You eat it and all of a sudden, your teeth stick together, and you go "Hi, how are you"?
It gets way back there and it's kind of like, uh, fur.
Excuse me, sir, if you don't mind my saying, may I suggest a little R and R?
Well, if you insist.
: Ar-ar-ar-ar.
Attention!
No, no, no.
Relaxation.
Once again, too much tension.
: Try a little yoga for the mantra.
When you get the mantra Lieutenant.
The man said, "ten-hut"!
Okay!
I can't hear you!
Okay.
What's this, your idea of a little joke?
No, my idea of a joke is this: This chicken walks into a bar, heh What's your name?
Mork from Ork.
Wipe that smile off your face.
I suggest, Lieutenant Fromork, that you start acting more in keeping with the seriousness of this assignment.
Okay, men.
The truck will be here in ten minutes.
Then you're all going on a little trip.
Where to, sir?
You'll find out soon enough.
But I can tell you this much: For some of us here tonight, it's gonna be full of hardship, sacrifice, and great personal danger.
Not me.
I'm gonna sign up for tennis, golf, and scuba.
La-da-da-da rule We'll take it La-da-da-da chance We'll break it We're gonna make Our dreams come true Doin' it our way Whoo-ooh  Hi, Mork, is that you?
Let me check.
Yep.
Well, I'm really enjoying this day off.
I'm finally getting a chance to do all those things I never have time to do.
You mean, like cleaning the pool, waxing the dog, or washing the limo?
Uh, we can't afford a pool, a limo, or a dog.
See how inflation's such a labor-saving device?
Oh, Min, Min, Min, you know Oh, no, Min!
Attack of the Jolson people!
No, Mindy!
: Oh, Minny!
Oh, Minny, Minny, Minny!
Mork, don't touch me.
It's just a facial, to make me look better.
Bad news, Min.
I-I think it's kind of retroactive.
Well, it's supposed to make me look great.
I don't want you looking great, I like you looking back the old self.
Thanks.
So where have you been?
I went to join that travel club Remo told me about.
What travel club?
USAF.
USAF?
Yeah, you know.
U period, S period, A period, F period.
USAF.
You joined the United States Air Force?
Lieutenant Fromork here.
Oh, my Oh, not officially.
But I just tagged along on one of their trips.
I can't believe this, Mork.
What do you mean, you tagged along on a trips?
Well, I'm not supposed to tell you.
It was all done on the Q-tip.
Mork, it's against the law to pose as a member of the military.
You go to jail for that.
Now, where did you go?
They didn't want us to tell.
I can't blame them for trying.
Because it was a crummy place to vacation.
Will you just tell me where you went?
Oh, to some nuclear dump about 30 miles out of town, as the Geiger counts.
Why would you go there?
They said it was an accident.
But when we got there, it was kind of boring.
I did see some guys playing a game.
There were these 40 guys in lead suits trying to push this big cracked barrel with long poles.
I don't think anybody won, but when they finally got into this big, lead room, : They all ran outside like they had hornets in their pants.
A nuclear accident?
Yeah, something like that.
Take care.
Mork?
Min, it was no big deal, really.
I just stood there for a couple of hours, and some people relieved me from my guard duty.
Then I came home.
How was your day?
I don't know how you can be so casual about this, Mork.
You must have misunderstood what was going on.
There are so many safeguards against radiation leaks.
Min, I mean, it's no big deal.
On Ork, whenever we have a nuclear accident, we just use Nuke-Away.
Nuke-Away?
Well, yeah, it comes in pine scent or that exciting new fragrance, fusion.
I mean, it takes the worry out of being radioactive.
Mork, we don't have anything like Nuke-Away here on Earth.
Well, then how do you get rid of telltale nuclear waste?
We don't.
Come on, Min, you can't tell me people with nuclear power don't have any way of disposing of the waste.
Come on.
Hey.
I mean, next thing you'll tell me is you're gonna put it in cans, right?
Ha-ha-ha.
We do.
You do.
Yeah, yeah.
You do?
Whoa!
We gotta get out of her, Min!
Come on.
We gotta take a quick hike.
We'll take the next egg out.
Don't pack.
I'll get you clothes at Frederick's of Venus.
Come on, let's go.
Mork.
We can't just leave.
If what you say is true, there are thousands of people that can be in danger.
I mean, we gotta tell somebody.
As we fly, we'll drop pamphlets saying, "Trespassers beware or you'll go bald".
Now, let's go.
Mork.
I gotta notify the authorities.
There's one minor hang-up with that, Min.
What?
Well, the Air Force is the authorities.
See, it's kind of like Catch-44.
It's like Catch-22 except twice as bad.
Yeah.
Well, we gotta tell somebody.
I mean.
The people have a right to know things like this.
They just can't get away with covering this thing up.
Who's covering it up?
Nixon's been gone for a long time.
I don't know.
Probably the company that owns the dump.
Why would they want to cover it up?
Well, they usually say they don't want people to panic.
Oh, I see.
"What they don't know won't hurt them, until it does".
Yeah.
I know.
We'll go to the newspapers.
Except they'd never believe us.
You're a journalism student.
What would you do?
A good investigative reporter would get all the hard facts.
Well, can't we just get some soft facts and let 'em petrify?
I know what we'll do, Mork.
We're gonna go back to that dump and we're gonna get evidence.
We'll take this tape recorder and we're gonna talk to the men.
Hey.
No chance, Lance.
I can go in as an Air Force lieutenant and come out as a radioactive reserve.
It has to be reasonably safe or they wouldn't let people in.
Yeah, but maybe we're just laboratory rats in uniform.
Well, I don't know, Mork, but somebody's gotta do something.
Goodbye, Mork.
You know, sometimes we have to think of others rather than just ourselves.
: Sometimes you have to think of others All right, let's see.
Mork.
Mankind.
Let's weigh the action.
Mank-i-i-ind.
I gotta get my scales checked.
Min!
Mind, I'm coming!
Mind, I'm coming!
Mind!
All right, wherever you glow, I'll glow.
Mork, how did you get this uniform?
Well, sometimes rank has privileges, but I think the supply sergeant was a little suspicious when I asked for a size seven petite.
Hey, it's Lieutenant Fromork.
Good to see you, sir.
We weren't expecting to be relieved for another hour.
Hey, who's the guy?
Oh, it's just another dog face, flyboy, junior birdman.
: Uh, name's, uh, Airman McConnell, but you guys can call me Howard.
McConnell, what's wrong with your voice?
Eh, football injury.
Know anything more about what we're not supposed to know?
Just what we knew before.
Oh, really?
I kind of forgot.
I had a football injury too.
Could you kind of tell me again, word by word?
Ah, you don't wanna hear about that again.
Hey, Let me tell you about Angela, huh?
If they hadn't called this emergency, I'd be with her right now.
Wait a minute.
Who's Angela?
Here she is being crowned Miss Rocky Mountains.
Whoa.
Whoa.
: I can see why.
Yeah, well, I like 'em curvy.
Say, how do you like 'em, Howard?
Oh, I like 'em intelligent.
Just how serious was that injury?
Don't worry about McConnell.
He's got everything that a woman wants.
Listen, we're gonna take our leave.
We'll see you later, all right?
See you guys, huh?
Hey, way to go, way to go.
: What is this?
It's man stuff.
Well, I'll let it go this time, but just remember I am a woman.
Is my mustache on straight?
Is it supposed to go up and down?
No!
Then it's on right.
Mind, at least we passed the first test.
They believed that you were a man.
Yeah.
See, I told you the mustache would work better than steroids.
Well, what do we do now?
Well, we wait until somebody who knows something comes in, and then we get them to answer some questions into the tape recorder.
Do you have it in a safe place?
It's in my pocket.
Good.
Do you think we're in any danger here?
I don't know, but if my knees knock any louder, I'm gonna look inside my pants and see who's there.
I'll bet you that's where they're keeping the leaking container.
The recorder.
Right in my hip pocket.
Why did you put it back there?
Shh!
Ten-hut!
At ease, men, I'm just checking to make sure the area's secure.
: How's the situation look, sir?
What's your name?
Airman McConnell, sir.
Are you new?
About 23 years old, sir.
Ar-ar!
Why don't any of our men defect?
Exactly how bad was the accident, sir?
Nothing to worry about.
By the way, was your voice normal when you came here?
Sir, I think we have a right to know why the Air Force was called in, don't we, sir?
We were the closest military unit that was able to respond.
Respond to what, sir?
We were ordered in here to protect the public.
You see, we store a lot of radioactive waste here.
Now, most of these containers, well, they're just perfectly safe.
However, some of them, well you You might as well keep 'em in Tupperware.
What are you doing?
I'm right behind you, sir, all the way.
Just how bad was the accident, sir?
Well, the problem is, atomic wastes have a half-life of 240,000 years.
Now, fortunately, the spill was confined to a relatively small area.
We're keeping the canister in question in that lead-filled room.
It doesn't look like anybody's health's gonna be in jeopardy.
Well, uh, when will we know for sure, sir?
Does this kind of thing happen often, sir?
Old disco injury, sir.
Okay, I'll tell, but this has got to be kept in the strictest confidence.
I'm all ears, sir.
Go ahead.
Remo, did you read about this radiation spill?
It was only 30 miles from here.
Who cares?
I've got real problems.
Re Oh, goodness, you are right.
That apron just doesn't go with that tie.
Why don't you just splash a little more gravy on the tie?
Hey, I got a $30 parking ticket I gotta beat.
Oh, I get it.
You're gonna plead insanity.
No, I'm gonna try and impress the judge with what a nice guy I am.
And I brought him one of my special sandwiches.
Don't do it, Remo.
He'll give you the chair.
Very funny.
Hi, there, Big Apple-ites.
Mork, Mindy, did you guys see this incredible story?
No, what is it?
: There was an accident at the nuclear dump, and the company somehow forgot to report it.
How'd they find out about it?
Someone sneaked in with a tape recorder and got proof.
The newspaper got an anonymous tip.
Who from?
They don't know.
Oh.
Anyhow, because of the exposÃ©, the government has agreed to put all that waste in new containers.
I wonder why they wouldn't take credit.
They'd be heroes.
Well, there's an old saying.
: Those who uncover a coverup might get covered up themselves.
Or maybe the people that did it feel that the public's right to know is more important than being famous.
I bet there are a lot of people would like to meet and thank the people who got that story.
Aw, shucks, we'd prob They'd probably say it were nothing.
Hey, you two want some lunch?
Yeah, what'll What'll you have, Mork?
Why don't you make us a couple of hero sandwiches.
Big ones.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Hello, Mork.
What's new?
Well, no, no, sir, it's what's nuke.
All right, Mork, what's nuke?
Well, it's short for nuclear.
You see, this week, sir, I-I had a job guarding a leak at a nuclear dumping site.
Guarding it from whom, Mork?
Well, the people who live near the dump.
It was very hush-hush.
Why was that?
Well, governments on Earth like to play a game.
It's called "I've Got a Secret".
But when it comes time to tell the truth, it's "Let's Make a Deal".
Sounds like they don't want to burden the public with too much information.
But, Orson, how can you prepare for the rain if you don't know what the weather forecast is?
See, I believe people have the right to know everything that might affect their well-being.
Maybe there's a good reason, Mork.
Isn't there an Earth saying that "ignorance is bliss"?
Not in this case, sir.
You see, it's a good thing to conserve energy, but it's a bad thing to keep people in the dark.
I have some specific information I'd like to relate Oh.
Until next week, nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Nanu, nanu!
I don't think you need any more than that.
Mindy, I can't thank you enough for helping me with all the wedding plans.
I couldn't have done it alone.
Oh, that's all right, Ambrosia.
I mean, I like you, and besides, anyone who's marrying Exidor deserves all the help she can get.
I'm telling you, Freelander, no matter how fast you paddle that kayak, you're never going to get Steinmatz up on those skis!
He's so forceful.
That's one of the reasons I love him.
What are you doing up there?
Skinny-dipping in Mork's lake.
My last swim as a single man.
From now on, it's the buddy system.
I did it, I did it, I did it.
Oh, no.
You did what?
This time I did something right.
I got you a wedding present that makes me so proud of myself I could squash a toad.
Ooh, I mean, you'll never guess, so I'll give you a hint.
What weighs a hundred pounds and has feathers?
You bought 'em an ostrich.
Oh, no, you see, I didn't buy them an ostrich.
Besides, where would it stick its head?
Something you haven't seen since you grew up in that orphanage.
Exidor, remember this voice?
This is your life, Exidor!
Yes, that's right, it's Princess Lusitania, your mother!
Exidor!
My son!
Excuse me.
I I'm not Exidor.
It's been a long time.
Natural mistake.
Mom!
Is that you?
Cuspidor!
Exidor.
Of course!
I'd know you anywhere.
You have my gums.
Mork, this is the most wonderful present.
No one ever gave me a mother-in-law before.
This time, you really did do good.
Well, beat me with praise.
I can take it.
Mom, I thought you were dead.
I don't think so.
Well, if she is, she leads a very active afterlife.
But if she's alive, that means you deserted me.
No, no.
You were taken from me.
I sent you out to play.
A half-hour later, I went to look for you.
Just as my foot hit the blacktop, I remembered.
We were traveling on our way to Denver.
I woke up two weeks later, being nursed back to health by Indians.
Been with them ever since.
Oh, that's terrible.
But the important thing is That's my mom.
She never finished a bedtime story either.
Earth to Lusitania.
Oh, you're back.
We're engaged, Mom.
We're going to be married tomorrow.
Oh, I told her about that.
When she heard about it, she said, "Mork" I suppose you two are really in love.
Very much so.
Your son lit up my life.
That's what I was afraid of.
That's a lovely belt.
I didn't know Houdini had a fall line.
Thank you, Mork.
Would you help me with my suitcase?
Fortunately, I came prepared.
What are you going to do with the chain?
What are you doing?
It's just a mother's way of saying, "He's mine".
I'm not leaving this house until you agree to call off the marriage.
I'm just going into the other room so you can talk it over.
But Mom, this isn't fair.
After 35 years, you show up, say, "Hello.
How are ya"?
and chain yourself to a post.
Mom!
Mom!
I think it's important in times like these we don't forget the old saying, "It's not the gift, it's the thought that counts".
Ambrosia, are you sure you know what you're getting involved in?
Oh, I know most people don't understand my relationship with Exidor, but it's very simple.
Before I met him, all the men I went out with were quiet and conservative like me.
My world was a succession of brown suits and wingtip shoes, and I said to myself, "Is that all there is"?
And then I met Exidor.
The last of the swashbucklers.
Now every day is tubing the bonsai pipeline.
That's understandable.
I know Mindy feels the same way about me.
He said modestly.
Exidor adds so much color to my life, with his invisible friends and lakes in the attic.
Sometimes I wish I had those things too.
You're not mad at me for bringing home his mother.
She can't be all bad.
She had Exidor.
Well, that's very generous of you.
But I still don't want a woman chained up in my house.
I know how to get her out.
We'll do what the government always does.
We'll smoke a peace pipe, sign a treaty, then break it.
Don't worry.
Exidor's in there and he's one silver-tongued fiancÃ©e.
He'll have her eating out of the palm of his hand.
Okay, Mom.
I'll see if I can find you something to eat.
Mork, look what Mom's been saving for me all these years.
Oh, look, little bronze baby hip booties.
Is she leaving?
She's staying?
!
Exactly.
Mindy, I know it can be inconvenient having houseguests but after we're married tomorrow, there'll be no reason for her to stay.
She'll leave on her own.
Oh, she'd leave right away if we'd promise to postpone the wedding.
Exidor, you wouldn't.
She just wants a chance to be the mother she's never been.
She wants to take me for little rides on the tricycle, and teach me to play catch.
She'll give that up the first time she has to change your diapers.
Let me tell you something.
If you call it off this time, she's going to make you call it off again the next time.
Oh, please.
I don't need any girlish babble!
What I need is a voice of reason!
Mork Let me tell you something, if you call it off this time, she's just gonna make you call it off the next time.
Now, that makes sense!
If you just go ahead with everything planned she'll see that you're calling her bluff and she'll give in.
Thank you, Mork.
That's exactly what I'm going to do.
He's so decisive.
But tonight is my bachelor party here.
What are we going to do with Mom?
We could hang her out the window and let her dangle.
Grab it and twist it!
Oh, glad you could make it.
Hey, look, let's get one thing straight.
I'm only doing this for you.
I don't even like that guy in the dress that much.
I do know this though, somebody deep-fried that man's brain.
Bachelor parties in New York are fun.
In Boulder, a bachelor party is a Rocky Mountain low.
What's the projector for?
Exidor's out getting some stag movies.
Hey, hey!
Now, there's a touch of class.
I don't understand what the big deal is.
Who wants to see a movie, Bambi does Yosemite?
I brought some beer and, uh, salami over there.
By the way, um, why is that chain going into the bedroom?
Oh, Lucy's at the other end.
Lucy?
A woman?
Of course it's a woman.
We wouldn't chain a man, would we?
A woman on the end of a 30-foot chain?
You got it.
What's she look like?
She's got feathers.
That's wonderful!
This is gonna be a great party!
Ding-dong!
Nelson, come in.
Join the festivities.
Hello, fellow Boulderites!
I suppose you've been wondering how my campaign for city councilman has been going.
No.
No.
Well, I'm here to tell you that I am hot as a pistol.
I've joined the Moose Lodge and the Elk's Club.
Then you'll really like our stag film.
Where's, uh, Mr. Exidor?
I should meet the man, since I'm officiating at his wedding.
Showtime!
Would you get out.
I told you you're not crashing my party.
We're packed in here as it is.
Scram!
Who is that?
The groom.
Oh, my gosh.
I thought the bride was supposed to wear the white gown.
Oh, Exidor, I'd like you to meet Nelson Flavor, Mindy's cousin.
How do you do?
Nice to meet you.
What a baby!
She's rarin' to go!
Ha-hah!
She?
Please, tell me it's a dog.
No, it's a chick!
And she's wearin' feathers!
You guys are sick.
Hey, don't look at us.
It's her chain.
Mork, hit the lights.
The rest of you just find a place wherever you can.
Down in front!
How do you like that for an opening shot?
Leaves a lot to the imagination.
Are my eyes getting worse?
Hold it down, please, and let the girl act.
What do you think of the movie, Mork?
Well, it leaves you wanting more.
If I saw this baby twice, my boots would be full of sweat.
There's nothing on the screen!
Mork, Mork, can I talk to you a second?
Is that Lucy?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yep, yep, yep.
Mom!
Mom!
You can't watch this trash!
Mork, wait till you see the blond girl play volleyball.
Mork, I can't take any more of this!
Down in front!
Even if she does have a bag on her head, this is a little too rough for me, okay?
Hey, you know, you guys from Boulder showed me a couple of new twists.
Thanks for coming.
Uh, I enjoy a good laugh just as much as the next guy, but chaining and bagging somebody's mom isn't my idea of hijinks.
Down in back!
If you guys weren't registered voters, I'd turn the lot of you in.
Drive safely.
Spike it, honey!
Spike it!
How was the party?
Well, things really livened up after we took the bag off of Lusitania's head.
Sorry I asked.
I enjoyed myself.
I got to know Labrador better.
Exidor, mom.
Exidor.
We could have a bachelor party every night, if he wasn't getting married tomorrow.
But he is getting married tomorrow.
Not necessarily!
The old princess has an extra card up her sleeve.
Oh, I wondered why she wasn't playing with a full deck.
I'm going to put myself into a trance, and I'm going to stay there until the marriage is called off or until I die.
Well, let's look on the bright side.
I could've found his father too.
Her pupil dilation is normal, her pulse is normal, and her posture's pretty good.
So, what does that mean?
When a person is in a real trance, their heartbeat slows way down.
I knew it.
Did you hear that, Ambrosia?
Jeanie agrees that the princess is faking it.
Yahoo.
What are you gonna do with  during the ceremony?
Well, fortunately, it isn't here, it's Oh, you haven't heard this one.
Okay, are you ready for this one?
Exidor wanted to have it in the woods by a lake, so we're having it in the attic.
Ah, it must be a lovely world he lives in.
He and Mork are up there right now clearing out the underbrush.
When Remo and I come back for the wedding, we'll bring the rest of the food.
Okay.
I think I'll also bring my snakebite kit.
If you have any trouble finding us, make a left at the waterfall.
Okay.
This is an attic.
A man wouldn't get married in an attic.
But then, most men wouldn't chain and bag their mothers, either.
What's happening to our society?
I don't think you understand.
Exidor's a little eccentric.
He even wrote up his own nuptials.
I hope it doesn't start, "There once was a bridegroom named Exie" Smells like tuna fish.
Mork.
I've been pleading with Mom, but I don't think she's going to make it to the wedding.
She just sits there, staring into space, sucking the filling out of a Twinkie.
Don't you worry about that.
This is your day.
Thank you very much, dear.
That's deeply appreciated.
Who is that woman?
How come she gets invited to my wedding, and burro is sitting out there cooling his hooves.
Mork, start the music.
She's ready.
"Dearly beloved, "we are gathered here today "in this beautiful forest on the shore of this silvery lake" Is anybody buying this?
Stop!
I can't go on!
That's my mother down there!
I Oh!
Ambrosia could we just postpone the wedding for a month?
Please, doe eyes?
Oh, Exidor, I don't want to tell you what to do.
I just want to know where I stand.
I love you, and you said you loved me.
That was nice.
Now, I know you also love your mother, but there comes a time when a son has to cut the cord, even if he needs a hacksaw to do it.
But it's your decision.
I just wish you'd make it soon because I think I'm going to cry.
Oh, her little doe eyes are leaking.
I've had enough of this!
A wedding should be a happy occasion.
Listen, she's my gift, I take responsibility for this.
Mork, what are you going to do?
We've talked until we're blue in the face.
Including you.
I mean, her mind is made up.
She's not gonna change it.
Mindy, you don't understand, I have a superior mind and PHD in gestalt car wash.
Now, I know what she needs.
She needs a good old-fashioned dose of honest cruelty.
Princess Lusitania, there's some things we have to get straight.
: Time now for a powwow, huh?
: Uh, you say you love Exidor.
Well, he's upstairs about to have one of the happiest moments of his life, and you're down here making him miserable.
Now, why don't you go upstairs and join the wedding?
Listen, they're gonna get married with or without you.
Now, Princess Lusitania, now "Princess Lusitania," that's not even your real name.
I found out your maiden name was.
"Bloomasnitzpistle".
Now, come on!
Drop the act!
Oh, no, you don't have to drop it that much.
Hey, hey, you're molting.
Oh, hey, come on, now.
I don't want to see you cry.
: Mammy Oh, I'm sorry.
That's the wrong song to use right now.
It's not fair, Mork.
I'm 60 years old, and I never really had a son.
I don't even have any memories.
Well, I know it's not fair, but you're gonna lose a very special memory right now.
I mean, I know I know life can be real cruel sometimes because you can't relive the past, but, hey, you're real lucky.
Lucky?
Yeah, I mean, you have a chance here to get two memories for the price of one.
You're gonna have the memories of a son and a daughter.
Mork, you don't understand.
and then he rejects me.
I guess mothers always lose, don't they?
Well?
Well, I blew it.
Oh.
She's packing her chains and heading back to the wigwam.
Would you like to say goodbye?
Yes, I would but right now, marrying you is the most important thing to me.
Hit the music, Mork!
"Dearly beloved, "we are gathered here  Exidor Oh.
I was thinking about what Mork had to say.
He was right, and I was wrong.
I want very much to see your wedding, Exidor.
But I'll do it and stay on one condition.
That you'll forgive me and be my daughter.
Hi, Mom.
Welcome to the family.
"Dearly beloved, "we are gathered here today "in this beautiful forest, on the shore of this silvery lake" Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Yo, hippo hips!
Animal jokes, Mork?
Been to the zoo again?
Well, not exactly, sir.
I got Exidor to the attic on time.
Nothing worse than a man who's late to his own attic.
Well, he and Ambrosia finally tied the knot.
Now, it's double or nothing.
Oh, yes.
Exidor's wedding.
How does an earthling go about getting married?
Well, sir, you give a little blood, you get a license, and then you're in business.
Humans need a license for marriage?
Is that like getting a driver's license, Mork?
Well, not really, sir.
You see, they make you take a test to learn to drive, but the only test of marriage is the test of time.
In that case, is it worth the risk?
Well, sir, I think marriage is an emotional investment, and in these inflated times, it's a special bond between two people that still yields the highest dividends.
Till next week, sir.
Nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Nanu, nanu!
Hey, how'd you enjoy your first tennis game?
Well, my favorite part was jumping over the net.
The winner jumps over the net, Mork.
That's why you collided with Mr. Clayton.
Yeah, but tennis is different all over the universe.
For example, on Sperious 4, everyone has 16 arms, and tennis elbow is the number-one killer.
I didn't know they had tennis on other planets.
Only where there's gravity.
Imagine no gravity?
Service.
Also, on the asteroid, the winner gets to eat the loser, and the bad players keep rice pilaf in their pockets.
Talk about your "sudden death".
Oh, look, a telegram.
Gee, I wonder who it's from.
Well, in Ork, we always sign on the inside.
We do the same thing on Earth.
Wow, parallel evolution.
First, fire.
Then the wheel.
Now this.
Let's see.
"Set two extra places at dinner tonight.
And remember, I hate carrots.
Love, Dad".
Mork, Dad and Grandma are coming in!
Hazzah!
Massah Fred and missah Cora done come home!
Teppie, Gubie, everyone come in from the field!
Mork, we haven't seen them in about eight months.
It's 2.9% of our life so far.
Yeah.
Boy, I miss them.
I miss them too.
Oh, remember how Dad used to take us bowling?
Oh, yeah, he'd always want me to rest my head in the ball return.
He did.
We got to get this place cleaned up.
Let's see, I'll go to the store and buy some flowers.
I can make my favorite dish for dinner, wieners tartare.
We can have it medium.
No, I think I'll fix dinner.
Let's see, I'll go to the flower store, and then the grocery Uh, do you think you could do the dishes for me?
All right, I'd like to start by doing my impression of an art deco teapot.
Now crystal stemware.
And a Crock-Pot waiting for some chicken.
where's the chicken?
Where is the chicken?
I'll see you a little later.
Bye, Mindy.
I thought it was funny.
You know, I just can't believe Dad and Grandma are coming in.
I'm just so excited I can hardly sit still.
You want me to tie you up?
Oh!
Dad!
Surprise!
Oh, Daddy!
Mindy.
Oh, honey, oh.
Granny, is that a new dress?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Kids, this is Cathy.
She's with the orchestra.
Hi, Mindy.
Hi, Mork.
I feel as though I know you both already.
Oh, a psychic and a clairvoyant with ESP.
Yeah, close.
She's a good listener.
I've talked her ear off about my little girl and my little, uh, Mork.
Where's Grandma?
She couldn't come?
Oh, she's visiting your uncle in Boston.
Oh.
Well, how is she?
How are you?
How's everybody?
Come on in.
We'll catch up on things during dinner.
First, Cathy and I want to tell you the news.
Oh, what news?
We were married yesterday.
Wow!
Well, congratulations.
I'm sorry I don't have any rice, but, here, Doritos are forever.
Well,  you did tell me he was different.
Yeah.
Is something wrong, honey?
Oh, no, no.
It It I mean, it's just such a surprise.
Well, honey, we didn't mean to leave you out, but it all happened so quickly with Cathy and me.
There just wasn't time.
How did it happen?
Well, for six months, I was just another woodwind.
Then we, uh, both started to realize how perfect we are for each other.
So it's not as if we're strangers.
Well, I'm really happy for you.
It's, uh It just caught me unprepared.
I mean, I didn't even get a chance to buy you a present.
Honey, if you're happy for us, that's the best present we could get.
So, what do you do in the orchestra?
Oh, I play the flute.
Well, if you got it, flout it.
You know, I feel like a million dollars.
I've got a great job and a terrific wife and a beautiful daughter.
Lovable me.
The cloud around my silver lining.
Mindy, I hope you and Mork will think of Cathy as part of the family.
Oh, mama.
Oh, che faccia.
Che dita.
Che ballard.
Oh, Mind, now that I have a mom, I can do all those wonderful things.
You can cut my meat and take me to the barbershop, and you can buy me little shirts and socks and things.
Mork!
No, that's okay.
Mind, now we have a real mom.
A new stepmother.
What's the difference, Mind?
It just means Cathy's not Mindy's biological mother.
Yes, I guess I'm a replacement.
Oh, like sizzlean.
Cathy and I are honeymooning in Acapulco, but we wanted to stop here for a few days so you two could get to know each other.
Oh.
So other than getting married, what have you been doing?
Well, I've been keeping your grandmother out of trouble.
That is not easy, she has a crush on the entire string section.
Oh, sex and violins.
Well, how is the orchestra biz?
Oh, great, great.
And I'm getting rave reviews on my interpretation of the BolÃ©ro.
Ah, if it's Ravel, it's swell.
So, what do you two have planned while you're in Boulder?
Uh, well, uh, the first thing I would like to do is see the house.
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm glad it hasn't sold yet.
Uh, we're thinking of moving back here for good.
That way, you and Cathy could be like a real mother and daughter.
That's great.
It's, um, terrific.
Um, why don't we all have dinner?
Din-din.
Oh.
Din-din.
Mind, I'm gonna sit next to Mom, if you don't mind.
You don't mind if I call you "Mom," do you?
No, no.
That's okay.
Just don't ask me to push you around in a shopping cart.
"Shopping cart".
Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar!
Uh, Mom, what are the chances of my getting a baby brother?
Come on in.
It's okay.
You all right?
Yeah, I just thought I'd come in here and think a little.
I'm too excited to sleep, Mind.
It's not every day an orphan gets a mother.
A stepmother, Mork.
A real mother's the first one you ever have.
Cathy is the first mother I've ever had.
I know.
I've been looking through all your gift catalogues.
Frederick's and Spiegel, trying to find a wedding present for him.
Well, I'm sure you'll find something nice.
Can't be just nice, Mind, it's got to be super-nice.
I mean, it's for our folks.
Well, good luck.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
You know, I want to get something for the both of them.
Maybe a negligee built for two.
They'll like that.
Good night.
I'm so happy, Mind, I want to buy a box of cigars, that says, "It's a Mom".
Good night.
Or maybe I'll buy them a wire-haired terrier.
It's a great pet and besides, they do the dishes with it.
Mind?
Mork?
Good night.
Daddy, I'm hungry.
I want waffles.
Good morning, honey.
I'll go fix you some.
Mommy makes them better.
Honey come on over here and sit down next to Daddy.
Now, Mindy you know how Mommy's been sick, and And how she hasn't always been able to play with you?
Well the angels felt bad that Mommy was sick, so They came and they took her to a place where she won't have to feel sick ever again.
When they bring Mommy back, tell her I want waffles for breakfast and some for Mr. One Eye.
Mommy can't make you waffles.
She's in heaven.
I'm waiting in Mommy's chair until they bring her back.
Why don't you call the angels and tell them I'm hungry?
Sweetheart  I know this isn't easy, but you have to understand.
Mommy isn't coming back.
It'll be all right.
I'll go fix you some waffles and some for Mr. One Eye.
I want my mother.
I want my mother!
I want my mommy!
I want my mommy!
I want my mommy!
I want my mommy.
I want my mommy.
I want my mommy!
I want my mommy!
Mind?
I want my mommy!
Oh!
Oh, Mork!
Mind, it's all right.
Shh.
It's all right.
I'm here.
I'm here.
Shh, shh.
Oh, Mork, it was just awful.
I remember exactly how I felt the day my mother died.
Mind, that was a long time ago.
Now you have a perfectly good mom just waiting to be used.
I mean, I don't understand why you're not happy.
I want to be happy.
I am.
I'm happy for my father.
But it just seems awkward to have somebody walk into your life and say, "Well, here's your new mom, just as good as the old one".
I don't think your father was saying Cathy could take your mom's place.
I think your father has a need for someone in his life, and he wants you to like her.
I know.
I'm just being stupid.
You don't have to be an idiot to see what this is all about.
What's this all about, Mind?
Well, they say sometimes, when a father remarries, that the daughter feels threatened by the other woman.
Why, 'cause she's wearing exploding underwear?
Fruit of the boom?
Not that kind of threatened.
It's more like being afraid that the other woman is gonna take your father's love away from you.
Oh.
Is this jealousy, Mind?
Well, I guess I am a little jealous.
Yeah.
I thought you told me once, though, that earthlings can love more than one person.
Like, when I came into your life, you said that you didn't stop loving your father any less.
Well, that's because you didn't marry my father.
Well, I am a little jealous, but not enough to make me feel this bad.
I don't know what I feel.
Maybe you should have a talk with your father man to Mind.
Yeah.
I think you're right, and the sooner, the better.
Now that I have a mom, I can do all those kid things I never got to do, like grow a milk mustache, stay up late at night and read comic books under the covers with a flashlight, go for long rides in the car and say,  "Are we there yet?
Why did the Arabs raise the price of oil, Dad"?
Falling down and skinning your knee and having somebody tell you there's no such thing as the tooth fairy.
Mork and Cathy really seem to be hitting it off, don't they?
Yeah, a little better than you and Cathy are doing.
Actually, I'm kind of glad they're not here right now 'cause I'd like to talk about this.
I'd really like to.
You seem to be having some problems with the situation.
Yeah, I am.
Dad, why didn't you tell me you were getting married?
Well, honey, I I There were so many arrangements, and we were so busy, and You could've called.
Yeah, you're right.
I could have.
I'm sorry, honey.
I just wish that I had been given a little time.
Everything was just sort of thrown at me.
To tell you the truth, Dad, it was kind of like you'd completely forgotten about Mom, like she never existed.
Oh, honey I'll never forget your mother.
She was the first woman I ever loved.
I remember I remember the way her hair smelled, her laugh, her voice.
Every detail about her is burned into my memory.
I remember she used to grind her teeth in her sleep, and it drove me crazy.
After she was gone, I missed that sound so much.
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.
Honey never think I've forgotten your mother.
But I also never forgot what it was like to to be a husband, and And that's what I can have again with Cathy.
I know.
Look at the two of us.
This should be one of the happiest days of your life, and we're acting like it's a funeral.
I know.
You're right.
Come on.
Come on, let's get this Let's get this place cleaned up.
And I promise that I'll try not to act like a jerk.
Oh, if I could only hear those words from Mork.
Dad, you like him, and you know it.
Yes, unfortunately.
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de ho.
Where's Cathy?
She's outside parking the car.
You know, pops, I really approve of your choice.
We're three lucky people.
Uh, Mork, you shouldn't have jumped out until I stopped the car.
I was just in a hurry to report.
Where have you been?
I was giving her a cultural tour of Boulder.
I took her to a theater in the mall.
There's no theater in the mall.
It's a little theater.
Actually, it was a puppet show.
They're doing Shakespeare's "Punch and Hamlet".
"To be or not to be, "That is the question.
You call that a question?
Whoa"!
After that, we went to see an art film.
War of the Worlds.
I meant to ask you, why were you rooting for the Martians?
Well, they're a much-maligned people.
Well, I told you he's a little eccentric.
We went to the delicatessen.
Remo and Jeanie didn't believe that she was my mom.
What'd you do?
Mom just laughed.
"Ar, ar, ar".
That's what got us these free desserts, see?
Ah, cannoli.
I saw them, I just couldn't resist.
My favorite dessert.
Oh, mine too.
My favorite is spaghetti Ã  la mode.
Mork's on the Weight Watchers hit list.
Oh.
Don't sit there.
Oh.
Um it's just that that was my mother's chair.
Oh, I I'm sorry, I No, no, no, no.
I I'm sorry, I Um I really apologize.
Dad, um  Mindy No, no, no, no.
I just have to work a few things out, that's all.
I I I'm sorry.
Mind?
I think she just signaled for help.
Oh, Mork, at first I thought it was just that I was angry because I thought my father had forgotten about my mother.
But he hasn't.
He just wants a chance for a little happiness himself.
I just don't understand why I keep getting in the way of that.
Well, we've examined all the earthly reasons.
Maybe we should try a little Orkan psychology.
I didn't know Orkans used psychology.
Well, normally, we like to use peanut brittle, but this calls for drastic measures.
Stretch out on the couch.
On Ork, you lie on couches too?
No, we usually have them strapped to our back.
All right.
We're gonna start off with a little free association.
Okay.
When I say "night" I say "day".
I say "Black" "White".
"Red".
"Yellow".
Wrong!
That's one for me.
Now, Mind, we continue on.
Tell me everything you remember about your mother.
Well, that could take hours.
Give me something more specific.
Ooh, uncooperative patient.
Well, what did your mother look like?
Okay, let's see.
Her hair was brown.
That's a safe bet, Mind.
And she was tall.
How tall?
Taller than a tabletop.
Ah, a furniture fixation.
Good.
And her eyes were blue like mine.
Mm-hm.
Let's see.
What else?
Patient can't remember what mother looks like.
I'm not so crazy about your Orkan psychology.
Oh, lucky you.
It's almost over.
Now, Mind, what do you remember most about your mother?
Well, I guess the thing I remember most is the terrible pain I felt when I finally realized that she was never coming back.
Maybe that's why you're afraid to test-drive a new mother.
You think that could be it?
See, when I was a little boy, I had this electric chicken, and I tried to pet it with wet hands.
It shocked the shazbat out of me, and I never wanted to do that again.
Mork, there's a big difference between electric chickens and mothers.
No, I don't think so, Mind.
We both got burned.
I guess you could be right.
Maybe I don't want another mother if she's gonna be taken away from me.
See, I never had a mom, Mind, and I'm sure not gonna blow my chance now, even if I have to give her up one day.
It's gonna take some getting used to.
Yeah, but you and Cathy have a lot of time.
Yes, we do.
You know, there is one thing I remember about my mother.
Whenever I had a problem or I hurt, she'd always put her arms around me, and that would always make everything just fine.
Yeah, that's real nice.
You never had anything like that, did you?
It's kind of hard to cry on a test tube's shoulder.
Most of the time, you'd go, and you'd slide down.
Oh, come on in.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Um, we just stopped by for a minute.
We're on our way to the airport.
But I thought you were gonna stay for a couple of days.
Oh, well, we were, but I decided I couldn't wait to get down to Acapulco and soak up that sunshine and those margaritas.
Yes, actually Uh, the fact is, I feel that I've disrupted something here, and maybe it's best if Fred and I leave just a little earlier.
It hasn't been you.
I've been the one disrupting things.
No, Mindy.
Yes.
I mean, it's been my fault.
It's the old electric-chicken syndrome.
Mindy, maybe part of the problem is that you're feeling pressured to accept me as your mother.
But Mindy should feel that you're a part of No, Fred, I'm not her mother.
Maybe it'll be easier for you if you just think of me as a friend.
I'll try.
If you're lucky, you can be both.
A friend and mother.
A "frother".
Cathy, I just want you to know that I'm really looking forward to the next time you and Dad are in town.
And if you do decide to move into the old house, I know I'll be real happy to have a whole family here again.
Oh Thank you, honey.
Oh.
Uh, Cathy I hope you can forgive me.
Oh.
Oh, just like a real mom.
Uh, Mom, before you go, can we talk about an allowance?
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Hello, Mork.
Has it been a good week?
A very interesting week, relatively speaking.
And speaking of relatives, Mindy and I have a new one.
What's "relative"?
Everything, according to Einstein, but stay tuned and turn up your volume because here comes the straight poop right at you.
Go ahead.
There's been a wedding in the family and Mindy's father came home with a new wife.
It kind of caused problems for Mind.
She didn't like having a new mother?
No, she didn't like having a replacement for the old one.
You see, humans become very attached to their loved ones.
And when they're gone, I think they cling to the memories.
Sounds like earthlings place great value on their past.
It's very true, sir.
Memories are untouchable, and humans have a need to be touched.
But the nice thing is, sir, that sometimes you can have one without giving up the other.
On that high moral note, mein Hindenburg, nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Nanu, nanu.
I suppose you're wondering why I called this lunch.
Well, let me guess.
Eh, you're hungry.
Mindy, lunches aren't for eating.
They're for deducting.
We're here to discuss my campaign.
Nelson, do you really think you can get elected to city council?
Heh, why ask me?
Let's consult the vox populi.
Uh, excuse me, sir.
Huh?
Do you know who I am?
No.
Who are you?
See, there's a natural curiosity about me.
MORK : Say it, win with Flavor.
Say it with me now.
Win the Flavor.
Yes, we'll hear from the old man himself.
Win with Flavor.
Say it with me now.
There's a parade for you?
My gosh, it's starting, Flavormania.
Hey, hey, hey.
What's with all the noise?
What noise?
Will you cut the tape recorder off?
People are trying to eat.
Okay.
Excuse me, sir.
It will be okay as soon as I hose it off.
Uh I'll get you, Ill get you a new one.
Make it a cheeseburger.
Give me that.
A one-man parade.
I think I have a goosebump.
Oh, it's a privilege campaigning for you, Flavorship.
You know, I've been knocking on doors, peeking in windows, kissing mothers, shaking babies.
It's wonderful.
I've been gathering the grass roots and distributing them, and the young people are going, "Wow, this flavor.
It's really nice".
What did you do with my posters?
Well, the whole posters didn't fit into my parade concept, They are little pieces, I just Yeheh, heh.
Eh, but don't worry, they're all numbered here and here's a part that only a mother could love.
Oh, what's the use.
No one knows who I am.
Well, look at the bright side, you can make a total fool out of yourself, and no one would care, heh, heh.
I mean, you could go on national television and go, "My fellow Americans, I'd like to show you the dancing weasle".
What I need, are organized groups of people to support me.
Don't look at me.
What can I do?
I knew I could get you to go there for me tonight.
Go where?
Mindy, tonight I'm supposed speak at the gathering of the International Ladies Garment Workers.
Oh, are you gonna take a peak at their union label, huh?
Argh.
I'd do anything to win those women over Even listen to them sing.
But at the same time, there's a meeting for the Committee to Clean Up Boulder.
I think it's some new conservation group.
I want you to go there and let them know that I deeply care about whatever it is they stand for.
Nelson, I'd love to help you out, but tonight I've got a student-teaching seminar, and it's real important to me, I've gotta go.
Shame, I can't find anyone to go tonight.
Whoo.
Whoo.
I think you found a volunteer.
All right.
I'll appoint you.
But remember, you're going as my representative.
So remember, don't do anything that I wouldn't do.
Would you do this?
Nee-ee, ee, prrrr, whoo, whoo, na, na, prr.
Ha ha.
No.
Pity.
Hi, there, concerned voter.
Put her there.
I don't think I know you.
Oh, of course you do, I just said, Hi, there, concerned voter, put her there.
I represent Nelson Flavor.
It's an honor I don't take lightly.
Eh Are you sure you're in the right place?
Eh, indeed, I am, sir.
Keep Boulder Clean, that's our motto.
It's our noble aim, and Nelson's one of the cleanest.
People come from miles around just to sniff him.
He is so clean that he makes Debby Boone look like a sweat hog.
Stick with us.
Nice chatting with you.
Hi, there.
Oh, oh sorry.
You know, Nelson's for purity.
I think it's an idea whose time has come.
What do you think?
I like where you're coming from.
I like where you've been.
Heh, aargh.
You're, uh, new here, aren't you?
You know, that's an interesting concept.
Let's talk about that.
Let's rap.
Let's share energy.
All right.
Welcome to our meeting.
I'm Jim Blake.
I'm Mork Blank.
I represent Nelson Flavor.
Nelson Fl Who's he?
He's a concerned politician as you can see right here who thinks that Boulder should be cleaned up, whichever which way you want.
Uh, uh, Jim.
Excuse me, fella.
How interesting Yeah, what is it?
I don't now about this guy.
Leave him to me, Prescott.
This, eh Politician friend of yours he got a lot of influence?
Well, he will when he has more groups like yours backing him.
Flavor.
Good American name.
Tell me, what does he think of the race problem?
He believes that he should be ahead of everybody else.
Well, that's what we believe, right?
Yes, yes.
You see, we're a white bread group, and we think there's too much rye and pumpernickel in the world.
Then you'll like Nelson.
He's well-bred, and he's no crumb.
Heh, a-argh.
Ha-hah.
Well, tell me.
When can we meet this friend of yours?
How soon can you spit?
Say, tomorrow morning at my place?
Sounds good.
I think our meeting's about to start now.
If you'd like to, eh, stick around.
Hey, quick.
You pick up quick.
If you'd like to stick around, we'll give you our beginning indoctrination.
We were sent to learn.
Oh, come with me.
All right.
Oh, thank you.
Oh.
All right, try this on for size.
Oh, dress up.
Do you have a Frankenstein mask?
There are no steins allowed in here.
It's nice to see young people dressing up again.
And to think they're all coming all the way over here just to meet me.
May I have a tissue?
I haven't been this deeply touched since the Walton's Thanksgiving special.
You know, Mork, you really haven't told us much about what went on at that meeting last night.
What's there to say?
They're a swell bunch of people who have some ideas about how to get the trash out of Boulder.
Well, that's good.
I'm really glad that you met some new people.
I think I'm a better person having known them.
Good.
Color me giddy.
It's moments like these that make the struggle, the sacrifice, and the sucking up worthwhile.
Oh, that's my friends.
Oh, quick.
Is my smile on straight?
Pure power.
That's our slogan.
Catchy.
Mindy, Nelson, I'd like you to meet my three friends.
Uh Mork, didn't you forget something?
Oh, three friends I'd like you to meet Mindy, Nelson.
Hi.
I'm Jim Blake.
These are my associates, Helen Anderson and Lloyd Prescott.
We're the officers of the Committee to Clean Up Boulder.
Proud to know you, sir.
Uh, Miss Anderson, Prescott.
Well, why don't you all come in and sit down and let me get you some coffee?
Good idea.
Heh heh, How do you take it, Any way but black.
Oh, ho, ho, ho, yes.
He's a card.
Whole deck, asa matter of fact, heh, heh.
Well, Mork's been telling us a lot about you, Flavor.
He says you're a true American.
Mr. Blake, I believe that the American people are crying out for leadership, and I want to give them something to cry about.
I like where he's coming from.
Ha, pure power to you, too, ma'am.
Back at you.
Hey, talk is cheap.
How do we know you're different than any other politician?
Well, if I don't know, how would you?
Nelson's very concerned with protecting the environment.
So what?
Am I wrong, or did I just lose some brownie points?
Don't worry about it.
It's time for the selling of Flavor.
Friends, are you looking for that special someone for your cause?
Well, here he is, Nelson Flavor.
Ne ne ne ne ne ne  Ne ne ne ne ne ne  Yes, he's a true American leader.
Blond-haired, blue-eyed, a true media honey.
Yes, you've heard the phrase "Nixon's the one".
Well, he's one, too.
Talk about character?
He sure is.
Look at that nose.
Yes, Nelson Flavor, no artificial ingredients added.
Come on, now.
Check him out today.
Paid for by the friends of Flavor.
: Well, you've certainly got a staunch supporter there, Flavor.
Yes, and I think Nelson and your group would work real well together.
Well, from what Mork says, we certainly are on the same wavelength.
I can't wait till you teach him what you taught me.
This town really needs some cleaning up.
I'm your man.
He's okay with me, Jim.
Well, I like where he's coming from, heh.
Now exactly how would you like me to help you clean up Boulder?
Well, first, I think we ought to start with the spics.
The what?
Heh.
The taco benders.
Now, we know, we know there aren't too many of them living here right now, but we want them out.
Boulder's for Americans.
Then I think we got to go after the nips, gooks, and bagel breath.
I don't believe this.
Then we can smear the krauts, Polacks, beaners, and jungle bunnies, heh.
Somehow, I was thinking more in terms of better water quality.
I don't know what these so-called Americans taught you, Mork, but I think it's ugly and disgusting.
It just so happens that Nelson and I are both part Polish.
Polish, Mind?
That's right.
Our grandmother came all the way to this country from Warsaw.
Oh, come on.
Har-de-har-harski.
Is this true, Flavor?
Not necessarily.
Of course it's true.
Now, I think you all had better leave.
We'll be glad to leave.
Let's get out of this pigsty.
Oh.
Come on, Mind.
Don't be so rough on my friends.
Well, if they're your friends, Mork, why don't you just leave with them?
Mm, all right.
While I'm out, I'll pick you up a Polish six-pack four beers.
Aargh.
Mork's turned into a bigot.
And then before I knew it, I threw him out.
Tsk, doesn't sound like the Mork that I know.
Oh, Jeanie, Mork is so impressionable.
And these people really know how to poison your mind.
I didn't know there were any hate groups in Boulder.
I didn't either.
Hard to see 'em, but they're there.
They hide behind the flag.
Mm.
Poor Nelson, I wish you could have seen him.
He was so humiliated when he found out he was about to support that group.
So you're Polish, huh?
Should have known with a last name like McConnell.
My grandmother was Polish, Remo.
Why do people make fun of the Polish?
Probably for the same reason they make fun of other ethnic groups.
It's easier to put down someone who's different than to try to understand him.
Yeah, but it's sort of a shame.
You got to admit, some of those Polish jokes are funny.
Like, I heard one about this priest, this minister, and this cabbage smuggler Remo.
Uh, come on, Remo.
I think we should make ourselves scarce.
Dobre, Mind.
I brought you a little gift.
Something special.
It's just for you.
Okay.
A light bulb?
Yeah, I wanna see how many relatives it would take to screw it in, heh.
Or the one about the Polish man who locked his keys in his car, took him two weeks to get his family out.
Or or these two Polish duck hunters.
One says,"Stach, how come we're not getting any birds"?
He said, "maybe we're not throwing the dog high enough".
That's enough.
Oh, all right.
I'll change the subject, Mind.
Well, you know what's wrong with Ireland geographically?
It's above sea level, heh.
Oh, you know why Greeks don't have freckles?
'Cause they keep sliding off.
That is enough.
What's wrong, Mind?
I mean, these are funny.
Mindy, are you okay?
No.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look.
What's goin' on here?
Remo, you know what my friends say about Italians eating Chinese food?
They use wop sticks.
Hey Here's one, Mind.
You know how to save a darkie from drowning?
No, Mork.
Good.
Mork, shut up.
What's wrong, Mind?
I mean, my friends laugh at these.
Do you see anyone here laughing?
I almost did at the one about the dog, because Sit down, Mork.
You and I have to talk, right now.
Mork, do you know what bigotry is?
Sure.
Bigotry, that's what they have in Italian forests, "bigga tree".
No.
Bigotry is when people hate other people just because they're different.
I don't hate anybody, Mind.
My, my friends just laugh at them because they say they're inferior.
Mork, I don't know about where you came from, but here on Earth, we're all supposed to be created equal.
The only people who are inferior are those who say that other people are.
Yeah, but my friends tell me that Your friend could fertilize Iowa with their mouths.
And they're, they're a bunch of sick, stupid creeps who could do a lot of harm.
Mind, they're just telling jokes, heh.
Mork, they use those jokes as weapons until they have enough guts to buy bullets.
I wouldn't be surprised if 40 years ago in Germany somedy said, "Did you hear the one about the two Jews"?
Before long, that's almost all that we're left.
I guess you're right.
That's not funny.
No.
Well there's one thing that confuses me, though, Mind.
Aren't there any people on Earth who are lazy, shiftless, pushy, dumb, and inscrutable?
Well, of course there are, but, but in every race, creed, and color.
I mean, aren't there people like that on Ork?
Not anymore.
They sent me here.
You know what?
I didn't mean to hurt anybody, Mind.
II just wanted to tell a few jokes.
I'm sorry.
Tsk, oh, I know you are, Mork.
Don't you think there are a few people around here you should apologize to?
Yeah everybody, heh.
Thanks for taking me to the movie, Mind.
I mean, you Polish people sure are generous.
Oh, Mork, look.
Everything is ruined.
Maybe we've been robbed, Mind.
No, I don't th There's the stereo and the TV.
Oh, look at my dishes.
And my plants.
Oh, no.
They've snuffed fern.
My dad bought me this when I moved in here.
: Oh, Mork.
It's all right, Mind.
You can sleep on your side for a while.
I wonder if they did anything to the attic.
Let me check.
Oh.
Oh, Mork.
I'm scared.
Okay It's all right, Mind, You just stay here.
You lock the door, and I'll be right back.
Where are you gonna go?
Got a little score to settle with the friends.
You want pure power?
I'll show you pure power.
Oooo.
Eeeeeee.
Eeeee.
Ooooo.
Ooooo.
Mmmmmmmm.
Eeeeeee.
Ooo.
Eeeeeee.
Ooo.
Ooo.
Ooo.
Ooo.
Pfffffft.
Oooooo.
Oooooo.
Oooooo.
Oooooo.
Oooooo.
Ooooo.
Eeeeee.
That's what I think of your little group.
Mork.
Mork.
Ah, Mork, what have you done?
Oh, Mork, violence just leads to more violence.
Yeah I think I've done the wrong thing.
I'm becoming like them.
This is how wars get started, Mind.
We can't fight hate with hate.
We're just not good at it.
What's the answer?
Oh, I don't know.
I wish I did.
I was taught to fight hate with love and understanding.
That's good odds.
It's two against one.
What the hell are you doing?
Makin' a mess, heh, heh.
Well, we're gonna make a mess out of you and the Polack.
Oh, I guess this is a job for love, Mind.
Oh, hon, would you look at this?
This is so unkempt, ha, ha, ha.
I know, you, you must be tired after a hard day of hating various and sundry ethnic groups, so why don't you just sit down.
I'll get your pipe, slippers, and kerosene.
All right, Prescott.
Let's get him.
Mind, I don't think love worked.
Maybe we better try a little understanding.
Ooooo.
I feel strange.
Me too.
Ah, look, Blake is black.
Oo-oo.
What happened?
Well, I just kind of reprogrammed their genes.
Mork, are they gonna stay this way?
Oh, only until they learn about brotherhood without the hood.
Goodbye, everybody.
Welcome to America.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, nicest person in the history of the universe.
Mork?
Sir?
I'm surprised.
You usually greet me with some slur about my size.
Oh, not anymore, oh, wonderful being.
I've learned that slurs can be harmful.
Actually, I've sort of gotten used to your remarks.
Oh, I'm glad to hear that, your porky pigness, heh.
I just want to say that f-f-f-f forget it.
Your report, Mork.
Yes, sir.
This week, sir, a group of people taught me about a new emotion called hate.
Is hate anything like love?
Well, sir, let's just say they use the sheets for different purposes.
Or as one poet says, "Love builds bridges between people.
Hate binds them up".
Why does this group you mentioned teach hate?
Well, sir, there are certain people here on Earth who can only feel up by putting other people down.
For example, when we call someone ambitious, they call them pushy.
When we call someone carefree, they call them lazy bum.
When we call someone different, they call them hippie freak.
When they call someone inscrutable, we say, "What's that"?
It seems to me that hate affects vision and distorts what people see.
Oh, it does, sir.
I wish they could make a contact lens for the mind so that these people would see that when you mix all different varieties of earthlings together, you get this incredible human rainbow that stems from the same source, and each person has his own pot of gold.
Till next week, sir, nanu sayonara shalom dosvedanya ciao lon sauri, heh.
From all of us here on this wonderful little planet saying, heh, "catch you later".
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Nanu, nanu!
Okay, Mork, I'm ready to go.
Mork?
Mork.
: Shut the box.
What are you doing in there?
I was just sitting in here because it reminds me of the house I used to have on Ork.
I had a condominium.
And this is a lot bigger, actually.
We were gonna go hiking, remember?
Oh, Mindy, I'm not in the mood.
I'm thinking, my planet's so far away.
I can't even Oh, it's out there.
It sounds like you're homesick.
Oh, it's worse.
I'm Orksick.
Oh.
Orson promised me a vacation, then he said I couldn't go.
He said there was a story about the eggs being grounded because of cracks.
Oh, Mindy.
: Mindy, no.
Oh, it's not fair!
Oh!
Aw, Mork.
I'm I'm sure Orson will give you another vacation real soon.
Ha!
A lot you know.
I'll never be able to skip through the fields of aluminum again picking little Tupperware buds.
And look up at those 18 moons.
Ork has 18 moons?
Oh, yes.
That's why all of our coyotes have laryngitis.
It's real strange.
You'll see them at night going:  Oh, you are depressed, aren't you?
Well, I'll fix that.
Here, raise your left arm.
Now, raise your right arm.
That was wildly creative, Mindy, but it hardly lightens the load.
Oh, come on, Mork.
Life can be beautiful anywhere if you just give it the chance.
Mindy, stop looking at the world through WASP-colored glasses.
Don't you understand?
I got a right to sing the blues.
Five, six, seven  Oh, I wander Throughout the universe It just seems To make it worse I can't get it Off my mind I ain't had a close encounter Of any kind  Oh, nanus is good news That's why I'm singin' These Orkan blues    Probably an agent with a recording contract.
Oh, hello, Mr. Bickley.
Sorry about the noise.
Noise?
You mean the music?
I danced all the way upstairs just filled with joy at being in the same building with musical Mork and perky little Mindy with the tweakable nose.
Got your nose.
La-la-la I have been truly blessed.
Ta-ta.
What's that?
Did you say I forgot something, mayhaps?
Now, what could it be?
Ah, yes.
I would like both of you to come down to my apartment this evening to meet my son.
Your son?
I didn't know you had a son.
Yes, I've done it all at least once.
Tom is a wonderful boy, and he's about your age.
And I'm sure you'll have a lot in common.
Seven-thirty?
Sure.
We'd love to meet him.
I just knew you loved kids.
Here's your nose back.
La-la-la Do you believe it?
See?
Bickley actually does have a nice side.
I knew that if we waited long enough that eventually it would have to surface.
But won't that be interesting to meet his son?
I can't go, Mindy.
I I have a date with self-pity.
Oh.
Come on, Mork.
Look, a lot A lot of times, a good way to get your mind off of your troubles is to do something nice for somebody else.
Like what?
Tonight we'll go down to Bickley's, and you'll be nice to his son.
And in the meantime you can take me hiking like you promised.
All right.
I I don't want to ruin your day.
I'll take you hiking but I don't want to leave the apartment.
So you You just walk in place.
Walk in place.
Here we go.
Here we go.
You walk in place.
Here comes a quaking aspen.
Oh, no!
Mork Oh, keep walking.
Keep walking.
A tap-dancing sequoia.
Here comes a little bunny.
Oh, no, a truck.
Pfft!
Come in.
It's open.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Why are you sitting in the dark?
I'm sorry.
The switch, it's on the wall by the door.
I was just reading.
Oh, gee, you shouldn't read in the dark.
You'll go bl Bl Uh I've been Bl Bl Bl For quite some time, now.
You know, I cannot wait until they come out with a Braille edition of Playboy.
Oh, well, I'm Mindy McConnell, and this is my friend Mork.
Oh, I'm I'm Tom Bickley.
Hi.
Hi.
This is my friend Dinah.
Yeah.
Hi.
Your father didn't tell us that I mean, uh, your father didn't He didn't say that I was blind?
No.
Thank you.
Well, you know, Dad's not the kind of fellow that likes to brag.
Mindy, what does "blind" mean?
It means that he can't see.
Oh.
I I was just testing.
You'll have to excuse Mork.
He's never seen a blind person before.
Neither have I. What's the dog for?
She's special.
She really is.
She She leads me around and she helps me find my shoes.
Most of the time, though, she just keeps me from making a fool out of myself.
That's what I have Mindy for.
So is your father here?
Mindy, show some sensitivity.
How would he know?
No, no.
Dad called and said he'd be a little late, but that his best friends, Mork and Mindy, would keep me company.
Does "best" mean "only"?
Ar!
Um So how'd you get into the apartment?
Oh, Dad left a key for me.
Hidden in the lock.
He's going to meet me later at the Purple Grotto Club.
I'm performing there.
Oh, you're a performer.
: That's wonderful.
Does the dog do tricks?
No.
No, I'm I'm a singer.
I I sing about the thing that I can see with my other senses.
I mean, like, the sound of a squeaky porch swing or the friends I left back home.
: Oh, back home.
Anguish.
Renewed sorrow.
Mork, remember what I said?
Oh.
You said I'm gonna do nice things for people.
Well, Tom, can I read you the newspaper or tell you if you're dressed funny?
I could do some mime if you'd Oh.
Uh, Mork's been trying to do nice things for people to cheer himself up.
You see, he, um He's been kind of homesick lately.
Well, I I get that way too, sometimes when I'm on the road.
Yeah.
Hey, it's after 8:00.
I've got to get to work.
Oh.
Oh, how did you know what time it was?
Oh, this is a special watch you can feel.
See?
When Mickey's left hand is pointing to the 8, and his cane is pointing to 3.
Hey, listen, why don't you guys come along?
I'm sure you could sit with Dad and see my act.
Oh.
Dinah, get your leash.
Well, that sounds like fun, doesn't it, Mork?
Yes, ma'am, it does.
Mm-hm.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bring it back.
Come on.
Come on.
Oh, isn't she wonderful?
That's a good girl.
She's just terrific.
Good girl.
That's no big deal, Mindy.
I can do that and I don't shed.
Mork, be nice?
Oh, be nice.
Yes.
Well, um, c Can I help you put that on?
Oh, yes, please.
Oh, gladly.
Okay.
Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Purple Grotto is proud to present a very special entertainer: Mr. Tom Bickley.
Good evening, everybody.
I got a lot of great songs to sing for you tonight.
Fooled you.
Believe in yourself If you believe in yourself Yeah  Yeah.
Whoo!
Ha-ha-ha!
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
I really did have an incredible time being with you tonight, but do me a favor, would you?
When you leave, drive carefully.
I always try to.
Wasn't he great?
And do you believe he writes all his own songs?
Tom, you were wonderful.
Thank you, Mindy.
I enjoyed you too, even though I'm into heavy mope.
I guess my dad's late.
Yeah, I wonder what happened to him.
Well, he's got a lot of stuff to do.
I I'm sure he'll get here by the second show.
You know, we've got so much to talk about, and tomorrow, we might even get in a round of golf.
I didn't know you could play TOM : Yeah, I can play golf.
I'm really into sports, actually.
I water-ski and try to jog a few miles every day.
And I love to skydive.
You jump out of planes?
I bet the hard part is to keep your dog from screaming, huh?
Excuse me, folks.
Tom, the operator took this message for you while you were on stage.
Okay?
Oh, thank you, Marty.
Thank you.
Mork, would you read this for me?
Oh, sure.
All done.
I'll read it.
Oh, it's from your dad.
He says Oh, he says he can't be here.
He was called out of town, and he'll see you on your next visit.
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah, well, that's my dad.
Always on the go.
When was the last time you two got together?
Twelve years ago.
Twelve years?
And he has the nerve to stand you up?
You know, no big deal.
I mean, what's a few lows with all these highs?
Boy, I wish I could feel like that.
Something's pulling at me, and I can't seem to shake it.
You know, you really can do anything you want to do.
I mean, remember the old saying: "When life hands you lemons, hey, make lemonade".
I wish I could spend the day with you one day so you can teach me to enjoy the life the way you do.
I'm not sure.
How can I do that?
Hey, don't ask me.
You're the blind guy.
Listen, are you really sure you want to do this?
I want to see life the way you do.
Ready.
Okay.
Let's go.
Did you ever hear the ocean As it rushes to the shore?
Did you ever Really understand What your senses Were meant for?
Did you ever smell That green, green grass When the rain Begins to pour?
If you haven't done These special things You don't know What life is for So get high on life The best is yet to come Get high on life You better let Your senses run Get a high on life You know the rest Is up to you You know, get high on life And let your sense Come through Love your senses Get a high on life Everybody knows Everybody knows They can get high on life Oh, yippee-yo-yi kai-oh, oy-vey.
Boy, I didn't know horseback riding could be such fun.
Ho!
I rode that sucker.
Whew!
Yeah, you were the hit of the supermarket, all right.
Too bad we ran out of quarters.
Well, my frown is down, my funk is sunk, and my gloom split the room.
Well, I'm glad you had a good day.
A good day?
It was spectabulous.
Are you kidding?
You taught me how to smell a sunset.
: There are the greens.
: There are the yellows.
I knew it.
Can we do that again tomorrow?
And tomorrow we'll bring Mindy.
By the way, she wasn't there today.
Ar-ar!
I'm afraid not, Mork.
I'm gonna leave town tonight after the show.
Oh, well, maybe after Mindy's class, we could, um, drive you to the airport and say goodbye.
Did I say something wrong?
Maybe we could wave goodbye, but I think that would be kind of cruel.
Twelve years, and he hasn't even got time to say, "Hello".
Who?
My father.
Mork, I can't take it anymore.
I'm damn tired of being brushed off.
I thought you said to me that it didn't bother you.
I lied.
It bothers the hell out of me.
I'm his son.
Why is he avoiding me?
I'd like to throw something at a wall right now, but I'm afraid I wouldn't hit it.
I thought you were the happiest guy in the whole world.
I'd be a lot happier if I had a father again.
I guess having a son with a handicap is more than he can face.
I think maybe your father's the one that has the handicap.
I just don't understand it.
How could he ignore his own son?
She'll get it.
Well, look who's here.
Oh, it's Mr. Compassion.
Hi, there.
I thought you were out of town.
Well, I fibbed a little.
Actually, my dog Bickie and I were over at the Holiday Inn.
Need any soap or towels?
What were you doing at the nation's innkeeper?
I have my reasons.
Say, have you seen my son, Tom?
Of course we've seen him.
Is he okay?
How does he look?
Has he grown any since he was 14?
Mr. Bickley, why do you keep letting down your own son?
I never let him down.
I sent him to the best doctors.
I sent him to the best schools.
I sent him all the money he needed.
And there wasn't a Christmas that went by that I didn't send him a card.
Yeah, but how could he read it?
Well, it's the thought that counts.
Well, Bick, I don't know about you.
I used to think so much of you, but now you've pushed it too far.
I think you better go back to the Holiday Inn and join the other people that are taking a vacation away from their responsibilities.
Please, don't send me away.
Please, don't send me away.
Where have I heard that before?
A little 6-year-old boy said that to me when I had to send him away to a special school.
It broke my heart.
I couldn't afford the school, so I had to take a second job.
My wife was lonely.
I was never home.
Pretty soon, neither was she.
Love doesn't keep you together.
I'd like to wring Neil Sedaka's neck.
Bick, hiding doesn't help it.
He was better off if I left him alone.
He had to become independent.
You don't know what it's like to have a child born blind.
And what do you do, keep him inside so he'll be safe or f-freeze every time you hear a car horn?
I had to make Tommy fend for himself, and now he probably hates me.
Oh, no.
He doesn't hate you, Mr. Bickley.
He'd like to be with you very much.
Yeah?
Well, the kid has rotten taste.
Listen, we were just gonna meet him at the club to drive him to the airport.
Why don't you come along with us and say goodbye?
Goodbye?
Yeah.
Tom's leaving tonight.
Well no, I couldn't.
I wouldn't know what to say after "goodbye".
Well, maybe Bickley's right.
I mean, it's only been 12 years.
What's there to talk about?
Yeah, actually, he probably is better off without you.
I mean, look at you.
You're mean, you're ornery, you're self-involved.
What could you possibly have to offer him?
I'm his father.
Yeah, you think he still remembers?
Okay.
I'll go with you.
Hallelujah, you old skunk.
May pigeons fly upside down the next time you wash your car.
I don't want Tom to know I'm in the room.
I'm gonna be totally silent.
And if either of you lets on I'm there, I'm gonna walk right out.
Then why even bother coming?
I want to see him.
I may be gutless, but I'm not heartless.
Hey, Tom, it's us.
Mork and Mindy and And Mindy and Mork.
Well, I'm I'm glad you both could make it.
My bags are packed and I'm ready to go.
Leaving on a jet plane, huh?
I thought I'd get to the airport early and pick out a window seat.
Ar-ar-ar-ar.
Mork taught me that.
And Tom taught me to give life a feel.
Hey, I'm gonna miss you, you big palooka.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss both of you.
I'm just sorry that I didn't get a chance to see my dad.
Well, you haven't left town yet.
The night's but a fetus.
Come, let's sit and talk in a kind of mellow way.
We'll share some energy and be one, you know?
You know, Tom, I really don't know Mr. Bickley very well.
What was he like as a father?
: Well Dad Dad was, uh, stubborn and cranky and grouchy and grumpy.
Sounds like a law firm for dwarfs.
I couldn't wait till he got home at night.
He always seemed to have time to play with me.
So you're saying that he was a good father.
Yeah, he really was unbelievable.
You know, he gave the best piggybacks in the world and didn't even seem to mind when I left gum in his ear.
And I remember the time he bought me a baseball.
Two hundred and thirty-six stitches on that thing.
And I remember swimming toward the sound of his voice my first time across the pool, And he said, "You can make it, Tom.
You can make it, Tom".
And I did.
And then there was the last Christmas we spent at home.
And Dad opened the picture that I drew of him with crayon, and he said, "It looks just like me, Tom".
I wish I had a father like that.
I didn't know Mr. Bickley had those kind of feelings.
I wonder why people always hide the feelings that give them the most pleasure.
You know, I've I've got a song that I wrote.
I think it's kind of special.
I I'd like to sing it.
Oh, yeah, we'd like that.
Yeah, I'd like it a lot.
Beauty is in the eyes Of the beholder And that's what I want to do Hold you in my life forever And just keep on loving you Beauty's in the eyes Of the beholder So take a special look And see And Just possibly You will see the love And beauty That's in you and me Hey Look for the beauty Please That was for you, Dad.
How?
How did you know I was here?
You're still wearing that awful-smelling after-shave.
I could find you when I was lost in a circus.
It doesn't take a lot to find you in an empty room.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
What did you learn this week, Mork?
Well, this week, sir, I learned to see by closing my eyes.
Have you been smoking your socks again, Mork?
Oh, no, sir.
I met a man with no eyes who saw beauty everywhere.
Are there many people on Earth without sight?
Oh, quite a few, sir, and generally they're looked upon as being handicapped.
Are people on Earth born with handicaps?
Some are, but others create their own by giving up on themselves.
You really have learned to see, haven't you, Mork?
Oh, better than ever, sir.
There's so much in life for us to sense and enjoy if we just wouldn't be so blind to it.
Good night, sir.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Nanu, nanu!
Oh, Mind, I'm so excited.
You are?
Yes, can't you tell?
Hey, nonny nonny, and a ha-cha-cha.
Sit down and tell me all about it.
Oh.
I just finished talking to Orson about vacations.
I really need to get away.
Yeah, you have been kind of dragged out lately.
Like yesterday when you fell asleep jogging.
Observing your planet is really hard work.
I've worn out two pairs of eyes already.
I'm glad you don't do that when we have people over.
It's been so long since I've had a real vacation.
Well, what about that time at the lake?
Uh, I guess that wasn't so hot, was it?
No, it wasn't very much fun.
But I did learn and important lesson though.
Oh, yeah?
What was that?
That I can't breathe underwater.
Gave me a lot of admiration for Shamu.
Why are all our vacations so full of surprises?
I don't know.
I thought going to Exidor's cabin would be nice.
I mean, who knew it didn't have any windows?
Or walls.
Or a roof.
A distinct disadvantage in a blizzard.
That's why I took you to the desert, to thaw out.
Yeah.
To that nude ranch.
Dude ranch.
At least the rooms were nice.
Yeah, the weather was nice too.
Come to think of it, that was the nicest vacation we ever had.
I guess I never should have taken you horseback riding, huh?
It was lots of fun, Mind, really, except for when I fell off the horse and he dragged me for two miles.
Why didn't you let go?
Well, at $12 an hour, it didn't seem right.
I just wish he hadn't dragged you through the cactus.
Yeah, me too.
Aah, aah.
Ah-ha-ha.
I guess we didn't get 'em all.
Ohh.
Oh, believe me, Mork, this is supposed to be one of the finest vacation spots in New Mexico.
Aah, ahh!
I believe you, Mind.
I mean, two million scorpions can't be wrong.
I just feel so bad for you.
Look at you.
You've been bruised, battered, beaten Ow!
Ahh!
I forgot about sunburned.
Let me look at it.
Ohh.
Ahh.
Well, it's better than yesterday.
Mind, I was once on the sun and didn't get this badly burned.
Honest, Mork, people usually have a great time when they come to a place like this.
Mindy, can I ask you one question?
Sure.
How?
Oh, come in.
Howdy, buckaroos!
I'm Ricky Day, activity director here at the old lazy Hacienda.
You know what's coming up in 10 minutes?
Shuffleboard!
Whoa, yay, shuffleboard!
What's that?
Oh, you're gonna love it, cowpoke.
We just need two more for the big tournament.
Oh.
How many do you have now?
None.
Then at 3:00, it's a long hike out into the desert.
You know what you're gonna see there?
The bones of yesterday's hikers.
And then it's a quick jog back for the chili-eating contest, and then an even quicker jog over to the arts-and-crafts center.
Wouldn't you like to make a lanyard?
Oh, Lordy!
I guess it's a lot better than buying one.
I made this one for my wife.
Sure takes the pressure out of holiday gift-giving.
Gee, Mr. Day, these things sound like a lot of fun They do?
But right now I think Mork and I would like to rest.
Rest?
On vacation?
Oh, ho-ho.
Hey, I got you.
Well, you have fun resting, Mork.
Aah!
Ha-ha-ha-aahh!
Oh, uh, say, folks, if you can rouse yourself up, don't miss the big slide show in the rec room tonight, Dale Evans, the Early Years.
Well, Mind, I'll be a good sport.
I'll shuffle boards with you.
I'll make you an ashtray.
Oh, Mork, what do you want to do?
Aah.
Go home.
I thought you'd never ask.
Mind, I finally figured out why that vacation was gopher gunk.
I didn't go far enough away from where I work.
Mork, we drove all the way to New Mexico.
No, I mean really away.
I mean, I've talked to Orson, and I've gotta go to another planet far, far, far away.
You're gonna leave Earth?
Where are you gonna go?
Well, I've written up a little itinerary.
The planet Murrowr?
Well, they say it's got a great nightlife.
Planet Hmm-Hmm-Hmm?
Yep, yep, yep.
It's a party planet, Mind.
The fun and frolic never stop there, and the atmosphere is 98 percent nitrous oxide.
I'm sorry I can't take you along, Mind.
Well, I have to go to school anyway.
And I guess it's more important that you go on the vacation that's right for you.
Oh, thanks, Mind.
Oh.
Oh.
Take good care of my body.
Your body?
Well, yes.
See, when we Orkans go on trips, our mind and spirit leave and we leave our body behind.
Wait a minute.
You mean you're saying that your body's gonna stay here, and the rest is going somewhere else?
Yes, we Orkans like to travel light.
Wait, you mean you're going on vacation, and what I'll have here is an empty shell?
No, no, only until my mind checks into another body on another planet, and his mind checks into my body.
It's kind of like house swapping.
That's incredible.
You mean I'm gonna have some creature from outer space living here with me?
No, two of them.
Yeah, but what if they're strange?
Like an alien?
What, you mean like:  Yeah, like that.
No, Mind.
I'm only going to Earth-like planets, and nothing in the brochure said anything about Mindavores.
Mork, I'm gonna miss you.
Oh, I'm gonna miss you too, Mind.
I hope you have a good time.
Why, I'll try.
I've written up a little inventory of my body here so none of the guests can run away with the good parts.
Check once in a while and make sure nothing's missing.
Especially that one.
Yeah.
Um, well, when are you leaving?
Now.
Bye.
Wait.
How long are you gonna be gone?
Mork?
Mork?
Oh.
This is very weird.
Darn cats.
It sounds like it's coming from in here.
I don't believe it.
He went to a cat planet?
Planet Murrowr.
: Murrowr.
Oh, that's right.
Great night life.
Oh.
Well, uh, welcome to Boulder, kitty.
Yeah.
No, no, bad, bad.
There Hey, you're kind of cute.
Ooh.
I hope you don't shed.
I used to have a cat when I was a kid.
It wasn't this big, though.
You must be tired from your trip.
I'll get you something to eat.
You like some milk?
Whoa, whoa, down, down.
Okay, never mind.
There.
Nice kitty.
Yeah.
Oh.
I'd like to play with you some more, but I've got an early class, and I've gotta get ready.
Boy, are the neighborhood birds in for a surprise.
Well, I guess it saves on soap.
What do cats like?
What do cats like?
Warm.
So I'll turn up the heat.
Oh, I know.
Sure am glad I saved this box.
Kitty, right there.
Good.
Good.
Okay, so I guess I'll see you a little later.
Be good.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Bye.
Anybody home?
Mork, I'm late for work, so I've gotta make this quick.
I didn't wake you up, did I?
Sorry.
You know, Mindy told Jean and I to tell her when our mom was coming in town from New York 'cause she wanted to have us all over for dinner, and We'd like to make it tonight.
Wow, it's hot in here, huh?
Hey, I'll open a window, okay?
Um, hey, Mork, don't forget to tell Mindy about dinner tonight.
Yeah, I'm that way in the morning too.
Hi, I'm back.
I got you the biggest one I could find.
Mork.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Oh, no!
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!
Here, kitty, kitty!
Oh.
Not you, Irving.
Go home.
Oh, what am I gonna do now?
I can't call the police.
They're gonna think I'm crazy.
Who can I get to help me?
It's worth a try, I guess.
Uh, Mindy calling Orson.
Mindy calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Yo, your fattitude!
I didn't think it would work.
Oh, Mork, I hope that's you.
Hi, are you Mindy McConnell?
Uh-huh.
This is the place.
Oh.
A dog chased him up a tree.
Man, I wish I could climb like that.
He hasn't moved in 20 minutes.
That poodle sure must have scared him.
We found this note in his pocket.
"Property of Mindy McConnell".
That's me, and at the right address.
Well, thanks, you guys.
I was really worried about him.
Where do you want him?
Oh, right there's fine.
Well, goodbye, Miss McConnell.
Bye.
Oh, can I give you boys anything?
Oh, no, thank you.
Just cut his nails before you let him out next time.
He likes to scratch.
Is this your boyfriend?
Uh, yeah.
Gee, and you seem like such a normal girl.
Goodbye.
Oh, Mork, are you all right?
You look all right.
Oh, boy, Mork, I know how much this vacation meant to you, but I wish you could have taken your body with you.
Oh, hi.
Are you dangerous?
You tell me.
Whoa!
Oh, you got it.
Wait.
Oh, oh.
Let go of me.
Oh, I know you may find me a little grotesque in my present form, but where I come from, I have six arms and a propeller.
You, uh You must be from the planet Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.
No, that's: Heh-Heh-Heh.
Oh.
Whoa.
You know, I came here to have a good time.
Yeah?
Well, great.
You can call me 12.
Twelve?
On a scale of one to ten, I'm a 12.
Oh-ho-ho.
I'm glad you feel Yeah.
Welcome on your trip, but I'm not one of the tourist attractions.
Oh, uh Uhh.
Yeah.
Mmm.
Oh, no.
Shh!
Shh!
There's so little time and so much to sniff.
Yeah.
Oh, will you look at these grotesque body wrappings?
Eww!
Do you have anything else I can wear here?
Uh, there's a lot more upstairs, but they all look like that.
Oh!
No wonder they say never swap bodies with an Orkan.
Come here.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Mwah!
I told you to stop that.
You're lucky.
I only used one lip.
Oh, please be Mork.
Hi, we're here.
Oh, you are?
Oh, you are.
I'd like you to meet our mom.
Oh.
Oh, It's nice to meet you, Mrs. DaVinci.
Call me Rosa.
Okay.
Don't they hug in Colorado?
Oh, sure.
Yeah.
Mama has to get her Italian hug quota in for the day.
I'm starving.
When's dinner?
Dinner?
Yeah.
Didn't Mork tell you?
Oh, yeah, he did, but I haven't put it on yet.
I mean, it's still at the store.
I mean, Mork's shopping, okay?
I told Mama here that you and Mork were our two best friends in Boulder.
This Mork.
He lives here too?
Don't worry, Mom.
Mork's a nice guy.
Remy, the commandments don't say it's okay with a nice guy.
Listen, you have to forgive me, Mindy, but you see, I've been worried about my kids getting mixed up with a bunch of beatniks out West.
You know, Jerry Brown and that gang.
Mork?
This is Mr. Nice Guy?
Yeah.
He's been taking dancing lessons.
I'm back, babe.
Yeah, Mork, but Mwah.
Not now.
Mork.
Mork.
Where'd you get the, uh?
Toys "R" Us.
Mork.
I'd like you to meet our mother.
Oh, hey.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
You know your eyes are like two smoldering pits?
Come on, now, let's get some sauce and barbecue.
Wait till I tell your father's grave.
Oh, come here, my little pasta.
Volare Oh, oh Save me!
Aah!
Mork, put her down.
Oh, down?
Let's party!
Ow!
Party!
Ow!
He's so vulnerable.
I never had this much fun when I went out with lawyers.
Heh-heh.
Come, let's go upstairs and we'll play habeas corpus.
Hey.
Maybe Mork needs some help up there.
One move and I'll break your legs.
Oh, Ma!
I never knew Mork was quite like this.
Fun, isn't he?
Maybe you all should come back tomorrow, and we'll We'll try this again.
I think things will be different.
I promise.
I hope.
Nice suit he's wearing.
He'll be the best-dressed guy in hell.
I've never been so embarrassed in my entire life.
Oh, Mork, if you only knew what you were missing.
Boy, what a dud he turned out to be.
Yeah, just another jerk in a white suit.
Have a nice day.
Mork.
Twelve?
Well, I guess it's just you and me again, even though you're not all there yet.
Well, I hope you have a nice trip back.
Mork, are you all right?
I hope you didn't break anything.
Who am I talking to?
Oh!
I'm back, Mind.
Oh, I'm glad.
Sorry I was late.
I got hung up in turbulence over Saturn.
I think I kind of blew my mind.
Oh, boy, did I miss you.
Oh, I missed you too.
Mind, have you been playing dress up with my body?
No, it was one of the visitors.
Oh, I think I can guess which one.
I hope they didn't cause too much trouble.
Well, let's just say I learned to appreciate you a lot more.
Did you have a good time?
Well, It was nice but I'd rather be in New Mexico with you.
Really?
I thought you hated that place.
Oh, at least I was with you, though.
Oh, that's nice.
I learned a lot about vacations, Mind.
I've learned that you can go to all the interesting places, but unless you have someone you care about with you, it doesn't mean as much.
You've got to turn to someone and say, "Hey, Mind, did you see that fire-breathing dragon?
"Oh, I guess you did.
Your eyebrows are missing and your hair is curled".
So you like it better right here in your own body, huh?
Yeah, there's no place like Mork, Mind.
I brought back some slides to show you though.
You did?
Well, let's see them.
All right.
There's me on the planet Murrowr.
There's me picking fleas out of my tail.
Here's me meeting the catnip dealer.
Um, do you happen to, uh Do you happen to have any pictures of your vacation on the planet Heh-Heh-Heh?
No, I had to burn those, Mind.
Why?
Well, who wants to see pictures of me going: Yeah, right.
Besides, it wasn't a very nice trip anyway, Mind.
I spent the entire time in my room because I couldn't get my propeller started.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Is this thing on?
Oh.
Attention, vacationers, Pedro and Yolanda will be giving mambo lessons poolside, 3:00  Well, Mork.
Sir.
How was your vacation?
Well, not bad, sir.
Except I would have liked to have taken along someone that I really cared about.
I understand, Mork.
Thank you, sir.
Next time I'll go with you.
Well, actually, Your Astrodome-ness, I would have rather taken along Mindy.
Not that I don't want to travel with you, sir, except she'd be less dangerous in an upper berth.
Your report, Mork.
Yes, sir.
I've discovered that Earthlings come back from a vacation much more exhausted than when they left.
Why is that?
Well, I think they treat a vacation like a job.
They try and cram in every activity except for that which is most important: Relaxation.
I thought the main purpose of a vacation is to get away from it all.
Well, that's what Earthlings say too, sir, except they pack it in eight suitcases and bring it all with them.
Strange.
What's even stranger, sir, is they say they can't wait to get away from all their friends, but they spend all day writing postcards saying: "Wish you were here.
Send money".
It sounds like Earthlings would be better off without vacations.
Well, the problem is that they try and cram all of their happiness into only two weeks out of the year.
Why shouldn't all of life be a nice trip, sir?
Nanu, nanu, little buckaroo.
Scenery is here.
Wish I was beautiful.
Happy trails
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Nanu, nanu!
Hi, Mork.
I'm home.
May I take your coat?
What are you doing in there?
Trying to make your day a little bit better.
Oh, thank you.
Here.
Come.
Rest your weary bod.
There we go.
Here.
Oh.
Ah.
There we go.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Whoa!
No.
Rest yourself there.
It's been a hard day at work, hasn't it, honey?
There we go.
A little mental massage.
Ooh-ooh, ah-ooh There we go.
There.
You cozy yet?
Yeah.
I really appreciate what you're doing, but I haven't even been to work yet.
I brought it all home with me.
See?
Oh.
Then the Algerian mud rub is out.
I guess so.
Mind.
What?
How come you haven't told me what you're doing at the newspaper yet?
Because I'm not supposed to tell anybody.
All right.
But you gotta promise not to tell anybody else.
My lips are stapled.
Okay.
See, I'm working at the Boulder Journal for a couple of weeks.
They hired me to answer the mail that comes in to their Lonelyhearts column.
What's a "Lonelyhearts" column?
Oh, I know, spare parts for donors.
No.
Lonelyhearts column, it's for people who write in and ask for personal advice.
Oh, but why would they write in to a total stranger?
I guess sometimes it's easier to, uh, bare your soul to someone you don't know.
To tell you the truth, I'm kinda nervous about this 'cause I've never done anything like this before.
Oh, Mind, you're good at giving advice, like that time you told me not to eat soup with the thin end of the spoon.
Yeah.
Well, my Journalism professor recommended me for the job.
And nobody is supposed to know I'm doing this.
See, the regular Miss Lonelyhearts is in Reno getting his divorce.
Are the letters in there?
Can I read them, please?
I mean, I am a super-intelligent alien with highly attuned powers of sensitivity.
Please, give me a chance.
Eeh.
I can tell you what that one's about already too.
Okay.
How would a highly evolved being answer this one?
All right.
Let's see.
"Dear Miss Lonelyhearts, "I found a pair of pantyhose in my husband's pocket.
Should I be worried"?
Don't panic.
They may not be his.
I'm a whiz.
I'm right there.
Next.
Oh.
Mork, listen to this one.
All right.
"Dear Miss Lonelyheart, "I've only lived in Boulder a few months "but they've been very lonely months.
Somehow, men just don't notice me".
Poor guy.
"I'm not looking for anyone that unusual, "just a nice guy who's sensitive, likes the same things I like, "and is genuinely interested in what I have to say.
"The trouble is I'm so busy every day, "going to a school and working in a deli, "I hardly have the opportunity to meet anyone or maybe I just don't know how.
Please help me".
signed "J.
From New York".
This letter's from Jeanie!
She sounds pretty low, Mind.
Oh, she sure does.
Boy, I'd sure like to see her meet a guy like the one she described.
Would that make you happy, Mind?
It sure would.
We gotta help her somehow.
First thing I've gotta do is figure out how to answer this letter.
What we have to do basically is work out how she doesn't know that you and I know that she knows that she doesn't know that we know it.
I wish it were that easy.
Waitress.
Waitress!
Jeanie Oh!
More coffee?
Sorry.
You want a new bag?
Just our checks, please.
Yeah, uh, certainly.
Come on, let's go.
Here's your money.
Bye.
Hey, Jeanie.
Can I see you for a minute?
You know, for the last couple of weeks, you've been walking around in a daze.
Uh, Remo, I'm a little lonely.
That's it?
How can you be lonely?
You got me, you got your friends, you got a television in your room.
Yeah, well, it's not that kind of lonely, Remo.
I need a guy who thinks I'm special.
No problem.
What about Turk down at the gas station?
Remember he whistled at ya?
He's a great guy.
He once bowled 260.
Thanks, Remo, but a woman needs more than that.
Look, I'm not I'm not looking for Mr. Perfect here.
I just want a guy who's sensitive, likes what I like, cares what I have to say.
There's nobody like that around.
You wanna know something?
I get lonely too.
Boulder's a long way from New York.
We're a couple of fish out of pollution.
It's hard to find your way, but you gotta hang in there.
Someday you're gonna meet a great guy who will appreciate you as much as I do.
I hope you're right.
I know I'm right.
You know, I haven't found the right girl for me either.
But I figure why not have fun with the wrong ones while I'm waiting.
Meanwhile, we have each other.
Hey, listen, why don't you let me close up for you tonight?
No.
I'll close up.
Okay.
You know, I'll see you later on when I get home from Turk's.
Okay.
You sure you don't mind?
No.
Sure.
You take it easy, huh?
I'm not going anyplace anyway.
Mork.
Hi.
I was just in here closing up.
I was just out here knocking.
I think I hurt my hands because I guess I'm such a sensitive guy.
Uh, you wanna come on in?
Oh, thanks.
Can I?
You know, I'm really fascinated by delicatessens.
I bet you are too, huh?
Uh, Mork, you okay?
Sure.
I guess okay as a sensitive guy can be.
Whoa!
You've got a dirty-dish collection too.
Oh.
You collect dirty dishes?
Yeah.
For about a week, and then Mindy makes me clean it up.
Ah.
Can I get you something?
Oh, no thanks.
Then why are you here?
Just to keep you company.
Oh.
What did you say?
"Oh".
Fascinating.
Um, Mork, I don't understand.
The deli's closed.
Well, I You know, I was just thinking how much we two have in common.
You're kidding.
Like what?
Well, for one thing, we both don't eat live game.
Arr!
Arr!
And we both love to laugh.
Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar!
Ar, ar, ar, ar!
Isn't that kind of uncanny?
Mork, you seem sort of different tonight.
I sure do.
Yeah, well, uh I gotta finish cleaning up.
Then what are you gonna do?
Uh walk home.
Maybe I could walk with you, kind of tag along.
We can do this.
Maybe talk.
We could be little walkie-talkies.
You know, no one's walked me home in a real long time.
Well, I'm not worried.
I think you remember where it is.
Mm!
Look!
I made the newspaper.
Oh.
They printed my first replies in the Lonelyhearts column.
Oh, congrats, kudos, and plaudits.
Thanks.
What did you tell her?
I shall read it to you.
Well, I shall be attentive.
"Dear J. From New York, "It's not easy leaving all your friends "and moving far away from home.
"You feel like an island in the midst of a sea of strangers".
Took me half an hour to come up with that one.
That's a catchy phrase, Mind.
Tennessee Williams, move over.
Here comes Colorado McConnell.
"It's possible that the person you're looking for "is somebody you see every day but are just too busy to notice.
"Look around you.
"If he's there, try not to be shy.
"Reach out and show him how you feel.
"He might become interested in you if he sees you're interested in him".
That's wonderful, Mind.
You're gonna make Abby crabby.
You think?
I just hope it helps Jeanie.
I was helping her yesterday.
You were?
Yeah.
I went over to the deli last night and cheered her up.
You didn't tell her about the letters, did you?
No, I just walked her home and gave her a few laughs.
Oh.
That's nice.
The worst thing we could do is embarrass her.
I know.
Why are you building a tower of Cheerios?
Because it's hard to stack oatmeal.
Why do I ask?
I have to get to class, so, uh, I'll see you a little later.
Oh.
If you get hungry, your peanut butter pagoda's on the refrigerator.
I'll never remember what order they were in.
One-oh-four.
I feel like I'm living on a fault line.
Hi, Mork.
Can I come in?
: I know you can do it!
Just put one foot forward!
I came by 'cause I wanted to thank you again for walking me home last night.
I really did enjoy it.
: I had fun too, especially leapfrogging over those fire hydrants.
Too bad about that dog, huh?
You know, Mork, um, ever since I moved here, I've sort of felt like an island in a sea of strangers.
That's a catchy phrase.
I mean, I know what it's like to be a stranger in a strange land.
Does Mindy know that you walked me home last night?
Oh, yeah.
I told her all about it.
Well, how does she feel about that?
Well, she says if you're happy, she's happy.
Yeah.
Mindy once told me that you and she were just good friends.
Is that still the way it is?
Well, yeah, we're buddies.
That's all?
That's enough.
Well, there's something that I forgot to give you last night.
Why did you do that?
Well, 'cause, uh, I really hope that maybe we can keep seeing each other like we did last night.
You mean we could do something very special like ringing doorbells and hide.
Your answer to my letter helped me a lot.
When I took the time to look around me, I found someone who was there all along, but I never realized how wonderful he is.
He came to my house the other night for dinner, and we had a terrific time.
He's so thoughtful.
He brought me this little gift, which will always remind me of him.
Before dinner we sat together for a while and talked.
The night had just begun, and already we were closer.
Before we knew it, we found ourselves holding hands.
Pretty soon one thing led to another.
When it came time for dinner, I realized he's one of the few guys I've met who tries to be a gentleman.
And in addition to all his other good qualities, he really knows how to make me laugh.
He has everything I've ever wanted in a guy.
He's so sensitive, gentle, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
He's such a good listener.
He really cares about whatever I have to say.
And, you know, he likes the same things that I like.
It's almost like a dream come true.
I just hope it won't be long before he starts getting serious.
Thanks again for your kind help.
Gratefully, J. From New York.
She must have found somebody great!
"I hope it won't be too long before he starts getting serious".
Serious.
If she wants serious, I'll give her serious.
Hi, Mork.
: Hello, Jean, and I really mean that.
Are you glad to see me?
Indeed, I am, Jean.
Make no mistake about that.
Is everything all right?
You seem sort of strange.
I'm really in one of my serious moods, Jeanie.
See?
Uh, is Mindy home?
No, she's not here right now.
But you can ask anyone: Mr. Bickley, Exidor They know her.
They'll vouch for me.
I am not a liar.
Oh, it was such a hectic day.
I thought it would be fun just to come over, and we could sit and talk for a while.
Well, perhaps I could tell you one of my favorite jokes.
What's black and white and red all over?
I know.
You're thinking, "a penguin with a heat rash".
but no-o-o-o, no-o-o-o, it's not that.
It's not a nun with a sunburn, either.
Now, come here.
I'll tell you the secret.
Did you hear a hum?
We'll have to discuss this at another time.
You are too much, Mork.
Hi.
I'm home.
She's home.
Oh.
Hi, Mindy.
Hi.
I've been wanting to tell you how much fun I've been having with Mork.
Fun with Mork?
: I've been showing her a good time.
Wink, wink.
And I hope it will be for a lot more days to come.
Oh, Mind, I'm so glad it's okay with you.
Me too.
Oh.
Do you remember that blue blouse I borrowed from you last week?
Uh, well, it's in the bedroom right now.
Could you get it for me please?
Yeah.
Sure.
Thanks.
Don't tell me you're the terrific guy she's been writing me about?
!
Yep, it's me.
Don't you realize what you've done?
But you said it was nice if I made her happy.
Then when she wanted to see me again, I thought that was even nicer.
Oh, Mork.
Jeanie wants more than just a friend.
She wants somebody she can spend her life with.
You mean like you and I share our lives?
And then some.
I forgot all about this blouse.
Mork, uh, if you like it, I could wear it tonight.
Um would you like to sit down?
Jeanie, um I think we have a problem here.
A big one.
I, uh, don't know how to tell you this, but, uh, I think I have to before it goes too far, if it hasn't already.
Uh See I'm Miss Lonelyhearts.
What?
Uh, I I've been reading your letters, and I guess so has Mork.
And, uh, see, I was only trying to help.
Um, I I got this job at Jeanie Wait, Jeanie.
Um, I gotta go.
You told me you wanted me to make her happy.
Yeah, but the trouble is you made her ecstatic.
Oh, what a tangled web I weave.
I don't understand.
Why'd you have to write those letters?
Why couldn't you come talk to me?
I'm your brother.
I didn't wanna dump my problems on you, Remo.
I'm gonna drown my sorrows in rocky road.
What good are these shoulders of steel if my little sister can't?
Can't lean on 'em once in a while?
I made a fool of myself, didn't I, Remo?
It's not your fault.
How were you supposed to know.
Mork was such a heartbreaker?
I'd have never guessed it.
I'm just so confused.
I don't blame ya.
Mork should have known better.
But whatever happened, I just can't believe that Mork or Mindy would do anything to hurt ya.
You know, if it had happened to me, I think I'd look at it in this way: Hey, at least I had a little fun.
I didn't sit at home with a long face.
I came out of my shell, and I'm not pregnant.
Hi, Remo.
Hi.
Uh, can we talk to Jeanie?
Hey, guys, I don't think this is a real good time.
Please.
It's important.
Well, okay, but try and make her feel better, would you?
Hi.
I'll be in my room.
Don't worry about the ironing.
I'll take care of it.
Jeanie, I just wanna say I'm really sorry, and it was really dumb of me to think I could just step into a job and become Miss Know-It-All.
I mean, who am I to go around telling people what to do with their lives?
I was just trying to be a friend.
I didn't know you wanted "and then some".
I'm sorry, Jean.
Wait, guys.
You see, ever since I, uh I moved to Boulder, I sort of had a hard time fitting in.
I never told anybody, and then finally I wrote Miss Lonelyhearts.
And she told me that this wonderful guy might be right in front of me, which he was.
And that all I had to do was to reach out to him, which I did.
And, guys, I had I had so much fun.
But do you know why?
'Cause you both helped bring out qualities in me that I forgot I had.
We did?
Terrific qualities.
And you made me realize why I haven't met that right guy.
I haven't been the right girl.
Oh, you always have been to us.
I love you, Mork.
I love you, Mindy.
Thanks to you guys, I'm starting to love myself again.
Oh, I'm glad.
Me too.
Me too.
Well, how does it look?
Remo, did you ever write a letter to Miss Lonelyhearts signed "Confused"?
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Hey, move, will ya?
!
What did you learn about this week, Mork?
Oh.
About shyness, your thighness.
Why do you toy with me so?
Because you're there, sir.
You see, sir, shyness is a major problem here on Earth.
It keeps people apart when they want to be together.
They see someone they want to know, but they're afraid to approach them.
What causes this shyness?
Well, sir, I have a friend who became shy when she moved away from home to a place where she didn't know anybody.
You did that too, Mork.
I know, sir.
At first it was very hard to feel at home here.
People were so strange.
They talk in heavy accents.
They drink with their mouths.
They sit on what we play checkers with.
I finally overcame it because I was willing to reach out.
What about your friend?
She spent a lot of time feeling lonely, then she realized her best chance of going out was to be more outgoing.
That reminds me of an old Orkan saying.
Me too, sir.
"If one stays too long in his shell, he'll wind up nuts".
On that same note, sir Nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Nanu, nanu!
Thanks for covering for me at the grocery store, Mork.
Oh, that's all right, Jud.
I know what it was like the first time I tried to put a live lobster in a shopping cart.
I guess we shouldn't have bagged our own groceries.
Ooh, dead bread.
Well, at least now we can have pumpernickel tortillas.
Looks like you don't have to worry about scrambling your eggs, either.
Aw!
It's not a pretty sight, is it?
Well, at least they died with their shells on.
May you rest in pieces!
I've never seen anyone get so emotional over eggs.
Oh, each one of those eggs represents 76 chicken hours, Jud.
You know, Mork, ever since I moved into this neighborhood, you've been one of my best friends.
Thanks for taking me to the movies.
How'd you like it?
Well, for such a conceptually interesting film, I usually like to see it twice, You know, I found the production values reminiscent of Bergman, and the dramatic values reminiscent of Fellini but what bothers me is, why did the coyote, after the roadrunner blew him up, come back 5 seconds later?
How should I know?
I don't even understand what you said.
Uh, what do you want me to do with the mail?
Oh, put it on the counter.
It's Mindy's.
This one's for you.
Oh, mail for moi?
It's from "The U.S. Dep Of Immig and Nat"?
I don't know anyone named Nat.
What's it say?
Let me see.
Sorry.
Oh, no, it's from the Department of Immigration and Naturalization.
"Dear sir" That's nice.
"With concern to your visit April 19 last year, "we require more information on your alien status.
"Please contact our office immediately to prevent termination of U.S. residency.
Love, Jimmy".
I still don't know what it means.
Well, it means I'm up the creek without a green card.
Being grown up is sure confusing.
I'm sorry, little one.
Last year I went to apply for an alien status, and they, well, the-they refused me, and I thought they threw away the form, but I guess they didn't.
What's that gotta do with a creek?
It means I'm gonna be deported.
What's "deported" mean?
It means I'll have to find another place to live.
I better go down there and check it out right away.
Careful what you say.
You're right.
It's the government.
If I try and duck any questions, they'll think I'm chicken, and my goose is cooked.
I guess I'll have to prove that I'm gonna be a fine American.
What's on the Statue of Liberty?
I was there once when I was a kid.
It says "Carlos loves Mary Beth Ovitz".
Oh, it's almost 4:00.
I'd better put on some decent duds and get down to the federal courthouse.
I'll stay here and tell Mindy where you've gone.
You know, Carlos must really love Mary Beth.
I mean, he built that big statue, and she's still carrying a torch for him.
Da-duh, da, dum dum dum!
America, America From sea to shining Waves of grain Yay!
You, uh, you must be my 5:00 appointment.
I'm certainly not your 5:00 shadow.
Ar ar!
I'm just your typical, American, patriotic citizen.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I had to stop by Mom's Diner to have a piece of apple pie, a cold beer, eat a hot dog, watch a baseball game, catch a pass, join the army, move to the suburbs, and shoot a deer.
Well, what's this in my pocket?
I don't know.
It's the Constitution.
I don't know why I carry it around, because I memorized it years ago.
Mr Mr. Mork, is it?
Yes, uh, yes, my fellow American, it is.
It says here you come from Ork.
Where exactly is that?
Follow, follow, follow, follow.
You know, Mr. Mork, it's pretty hard for an alien to get into this country, but it's impossible for a wacky alien to get in.
Ah, what about Charo?
Have, uh, have you got any identification papers?
Oh, no, just "Mr. Bill" of Rights.
Oh, no!
Don't violate me!
Your enthusiasm is very admirable.
Thank you.
And your costume is pretty spiffy.
But we don't grant citizenship on personality alone.
You can ask me anything about American history.
I know all the answers.
Who was Paul Revere's barber?
Mr. Benedict of Boston.
Uh, I know the names of all the states.
There's anxiety, depression, fear, catatonic joy, catatonic love, catatonic peace.
Jud told me you were here.
Oh, I am.
Ye Um, excuse me for barging in like this, your honor.
Are you with him, or are you normal?
No, no, I'm with him.
Well, then you could help answer a few questions.
Well, I thought we cleared all these questions up last year.
All I can tell you is his file is incomplete.
If he wants to stay in the country, I have to have some more information.
Well.
Well, my astrological sign is Nepharius, with egg rising.
We'll start with "occupation".
You got a job?
Absolutely.
What is it?
Well, observing a primitive planet  A reasonable planet A wonderful planet.
There a lot of money in that?
Well, not much.
I-I usually make my money from doing odd jobs.
I'll bet.
Excuse me, your honor, um, couldn't you just tell Mork what he has to do to stay in the country?
Well, for starters, he has to bring me a passport and a birth certificate.
Now, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll hold his file for five days.
But if he doesn't produce the documents by then, he'll have to be deported.
Oh.
I wonder where I left my birth certificate.
Probably with my passport, huh, Mind?
Yeah.
Ar, ar!
Now, if you two will excuse me, I have to take two adult-strength pain relievers.
Don't you want to hear me sing "God Bless America" in harmony?
Look, if you don't bring me those papers, you may be singing "God Bless Guatemala".
Um, excuse me, your honor.
Uh, just on the off-chance.
Mork can't find his passport or his birth certificate, uh, is there any other way he can stay in the country?
Not unless he marries an American citizen.
Oh.
Thank you.
Mork, have you changed yet?
No, I'm still an illegal alien.
Well, I've been thinking over the alternatives.
Well, me too.
Number one, I could run away.
Then they'd arrest me, there'd be a brief trial, then death row, and then president Jerry Brown would strap me into a solar-powered electric chair, and it would take me a year to die.
Well, I've been thinking.
You could run away, but then you'd be a fugitive.
Yeah, probably be pursued for the rest of my life by a one-arm immigration officer.
Or you could go to another country, except you'd have trouble getting in anywhere without a passport.
Well, maybe I could stay at the Charles Place.
I don't think so.
I think it'd be too difficult for you to adjust to another country.
Oh!
And you can go with me, Mind!
If we go to China, it'll be Mork and Ming.
Or if we go to Or if we go to Siberia it'll be Mork and Mindivich.
Or Or Italy, it'll be Mork and Mindestrone.
Or if we go to Latvia, it'll be Laverne and Shirley.
No, no, work, you can't go.
Well, why not?
Well, 'cause I don't want to take you away from your friends your life here, your dentist.
I've got another solution!
I'll disguise myself as an American tourist.
I-I'll get a Nikon camera, a long, two-piece leisure suit, that's okay, we'll rent some kids, we'll put them in the back, they'll wear Mickey Mouse ears and go, "Dad, are we goin' to Disneyland"?
I'll be driving along, look in the rearview mirror, and go, "You shut up, and if Grandpa passes out again, you jump-start him.
Now, come on.
Be quiet".
Oh.
Well, Mork The only thing left to do is what the judge suggested, getting married.
Oh, I couldn't do that, Mind.
Well, why not?
Well, because you once said that marriage is a very, very special thing and you only wanted to do it once.
And I don't want you to waste it on a favor.
Yeah, but, Mork, I'm trying to help you.
Nah, it'll be all right.
I'll leave, and you'll forget about me, and I'll forget about you In about 200 years.
Well, we can't give up now.
I mean, we've got five whole days to think of something.
No, let's face it, I'm doomed.
At least I have something to remember you by.
What's that?
Can I see?
Oh, don't open it.
What is it?
Well, inside is the very first tear you ever shed for me.
And you carry this with you?
Oh, Mork, that's so nice.
Oh, I hope one day, I can If I ever get real, real lonely, I'll open it up and brush that tear away.
It'll almost be like having you there.
Oh.
Oh, it's probably the library, Mind.
I'm overdue on that book, Raising Weasels for Fun and Profit.
Oh, hi, Jud.
Is Mork still here?
Well, he sure is.
Mork, you have a visitor.
Oh, rug bug, you probably just came to say goodbye, didn't you?
That's not why I'm here.
I saw this program on TV and I thought it might help you.
It's about adopting kids from Asia.
If you could find someone to adopt you like the Vietnamese kids, you could stay in this country.
That's a great idea!
Yeah, Mind, but I'm allergic to silk and I don't love rice.
It's not so bad if you put lots of sugar on it.
See ya!
Okay.
Thanks a lot, Jud.
Sure thing!
Hey, bye.
Mork, did you hear that?
All we have to do is find an American who'll adopt you, and then you can stay in the country!
Yeah, but who's gonna adopt me?
Me?
Let's see, adoption agency Adoption agency.
Uh, Mind Can you stop your fingers from walking for a second and let my lips do the talking?
I mean, I don't think this is a very good idea.
Why, Mork?
I'll adopt you, and then everything Then you'll become my mother.
Right.
You see, I already have a mother back on Ork.
I mean, if And if you adopt me, it'll break her little Pyrex heart.
All right, then we'll have to find someone else who'll adopt you.
Hi, kids.
Mr. Bickley!
Mr. Bickley.
Thank you for remembering.
Mind if I borrow a cup of Sweet'N Low?
Oh, Mr. Bickley, why don't you come in and sit down?
We have something we'd like to talk to you about.
Sure.
Why shouldn't I share the wisdom of my years?
Bick, we're just wondering, what's your opinion about adoption?
I'm for it.
It gives a guy an excuse to watch the Saturday morning cartoons.
See, we feel that a new son could really bring joy into one's life.
Oh, I get it now, you're thinking about adopting a little boy.
I think it's nice.
You get the kid of your choice and the child gets parents who love him and want him.
Everybody wins.
Oh, so However, before you do anything, let Uncle Bick give you a little advice.
If possible, find out everything you can about his background: Who his parents were, where he came from, and if he's had his shots.
You'd want to ask these questions if you were adopting someone?
I'd want to ask those questions if I was hiring a gardener.
Well, thanks for the advice.
Oh, sorry.
We're out of Sweet'N Low.
Oh, well, you might as well hold onto this till you get some.
It's yours.
I borrowed it last year.
By the way, if you do get a kid and you need a babysitter, just drop him by my place.
You can use that window over there.
Bye-bye, Mork, bye-bye, Mindy.
Bye, America.
Mork, I'm sorry.
That's all right, Mind.
I'd probably be too big for his lap anyway.
What we have to find is someone who will adopt you that won't ask any questions about your past.
Well, just hope it's not Roy Rogers, 'cause if I pass on, he'll have me stuffed and put in his museum.
I'm so excited.
Oh, me, too.
Where's the little one?
You're looking at him.
You're here to be adopted?
Oh, t-the bigger ones are always the last to go.
You mean you're adopting him?
Oh, no, no.
Not me.
Would you put that thing away?
There are ladies present!
Exidor!
Son!
Is that you?
Dad!
Morkie!
Here's the present I got you.
You left it in the other office.
Careful, it's still got its claws!
You're the best dad in the whole world.
Uh, yes.
I think I'll just take this for now.
Exidor, we really can't thank you enough for doing this.
I'd do anything for this waif Even dress up in this ridiculous outfit.
Exidor, Mork has passed every other interview.
Now, this one's the big one.
Now, do you remember what you're supposed to do?
Certainly.
I'm to be dignified, respectful And just as crazy as the rest of the people in this world.
Well, do you think you can do that?
Oh, sure.
I'm great at impressions.
Uh, watch this!
Hello.
Lovely day.
Yes.
Charming child!
Why, thank you!
Madcap enough?
Monrax, don't chew on that lady's skirt!
Lucky for you polyester doesn't fray.
Oh, Mork, I think we're in trouble.
Mr. Exidor.
That's you!
Good luck!
Thanks, Min.
Uh, Exidor Now, don't talk too much, and just try and play it cool, all right?
Cool as a night in Siberia.
Steinmatz, wash that before you put it in your mouth!
Lovely day, isn't it?
Uh, yes.
Now, who is adopting whom?
I'm Mr. Mork, and this is my father-to-be, Mr. Exidor.
I see.
I have the papers here of your interviews today, but essentially, the question of adoption rests on this meeting.
Mr. Exidor, do you have your references with you?
They're in the briefcase.
Oh, they're in the briefcase.
Lunch!
It says here that you're a doctor of philosophy, Mr. Dr. Exidor And that you studied with Spinoza.
He's been dead for many years.
No wonder I never got my report card!
Um, he means Mel Spinoza, it's his friend from Harvard.
It was just a little joke.
This is not a place for levity.
Doctor, it could cost you a son.
Of course.
Dr. Exidor, the key question is, why do you want to adopt someone as old as Mork?
Why?
My dear lady, where is it written that a person is not entitled to love after a certain age?
What you see before you are two people with complementary needs.
He to have a father, I to be one.
What calloused heart would deny the fulfillment of this just because one of us isn't wearing diapers?
You really do love each other, don't you?
Oh!
She bought it!
Dr. Exidor, I had my doubts, but you're a fine man.
You have a son!
Junior!
Mon cher Papa!
Take these papers to be notarized and bring them back here.
Your wish is my command!
We did it!
Exidor, you were brilliant.
If we could bag what I just said over there, we could double the corn crop in Kansas!
Wait a minute!
Be careful with those papers.
Those are the only ones we have.
Don't worry.
Pepe, don't throw that Frisbee in here!
And then I couldn't believe it when he said Mork!
Mindy, is that you?
Will you cut it out?
I'm sorry.
Just trying to be a chip off the old pop.
You know, Ex I mean, Dad's been awfully nice to me.
I mean, he even put me in his will.
Before, he was gonna leave everything to his burro.
Right.
And what are you gonna inherit?
A bale of hay.
Well, he was gonna leave me the Colorado River, but I said I had no place to put it.
You know, Mork, uh, we solved one problem, but I'm afraid we might have another one.
I've been thinking, and for the first time, the government actually has records on you.
I don't think so, Mindy.
See, the Immigration Department closed its files on me, and Dad didn't trust the Adoption Bureau.
He said he'd put them in his private vault.
Exidor has a vault?
Yeah.
It's behind Herman's House of Fish in a dumpster.
It looks like you're safe for a while, anyway.
You know, Mind, we got real close to being married, didn't we?
Yeah, we did.
I wonder what that would have been like.
Mr. and Mrs. Mork.
Well, let's see, you know, after a while, I'd I'd come home, open the door and go,  "Hi, Mindy.
Hi, Dave.
Hi, Rick".
"Oh, wow.
Hi, Dad.
Wow.
"You look really good tonight.
It's really nice to have you home".
Then I-I'd sit in front of Of the TV on Sundays with a little six-pack of ginger ale.
And I'd sit there for a long time, and eventually, after a couple years, I get a little ginger belly.
Then we'd have to buy lots of aspirin for all the headaches you'd get at night.
And then eventually  We'd get a lot older, and we'd sit out on the front porch in our little, motorized rocking chairs, and the chairs would rock for us.
Every so often, I'd flip my little pacemaker up real fast like that and turn it down.
And then, finally, one day, I'd lean over to you.
Take me about an hour to get real close, and then I'd lean over and whisper in your hearing aid, I'd say, "Mindy "After all these years you've been so nice to me, "I'm gonna tell you something that no one else knows.
I'm really a Ah"!
Mork!
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, your goodyear-ship!
I'm here, Mork.
What do you have to report?
Well, I had a close call, your high-and-wideness.
I was almost banned from the country.
Well, if you couldn't stay there, why didn't you move to another country?
Oh, easier said than done, sir.
You see, the borders are guarded by an incredible obstacle known as red tape.
Besides, I've grown accustomed to this place, and And to Mindy's face.
But are you welcome to remain there?
Well, sir, all I know is there's this lady who's carrying a torch for me who keeps saying,  "Send me your tired, your poor, and your huddled masses".
A noble sentiment.
Yes, except there's also a man down at the immigration office who says, "Not too tired, not too poor, and not too many".
How did you convince them to let you stay?
Well, I had to be adopted.
You see, adoption is an Earth custom that allows humans who like being parents to find others who need them.
It's kind of like an emotional swap meet.
Do the Earthlings get a reward for adopting?
All I know, sir, is their lives are richer for having done it.
You see, that's how this country was founded, by adopting people from other nations.
First, a few Vikings.
Then, some Spaniards.
Then, some Englishmen.
Then, some Africans.
Some Orientals.
Some Irish.
And some Eastern Europeans.
And before you know it, Orson, Good Griffith, you've got the birth of a nation!
Until next week, sir, nanu, nanu.
Hey, what about us, hmm?
Wash day.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Nanu, nanu!
Min?
Oh, Min?
Min?
Min?
Hi.
I'm just filing my nails.
Well, I bet you file them under N, huh?
Well, I have a little surprise for you.
Don't worry.
What's that?
Let me show you.
This here.
Heh-heh-heh.
What is that?
Well, it's the tinfoil collection of the kids at the daycare center.
Kind of looks like a meteor from the planet Alcoa, doesn't it?
Yeah.
I can't think of a better job for you than being a group leader for a bunch of kids.
Yeah, I am kind of an expert in the field.
Would you believe this?
Some people say I'm rather childlike myself.
Well, that's news.
Yeah.
Race you!
Ha-ha-ha!
Hello, Mork.
Hi, Mindy.
Hi, Nelson.
Nice ball of tin.
May I take your coat?
I've always liked it.
Ar-ar.
Well, some, uh, interesting development has transpired, and I'm proud as a peahen.
I'm gonna give a speech on television.
You're kidding!
That's wonderful.
I've worked very, very hard on it, and I, uh, wanted to get your reactions to it, what you think about it.
Sure.
Well, it looks nice from here.
Nice crease.
A little albino origami, huh?
I think he wants to read it to us, Mork.
Oh.
Oh, dopey moi.
Okay, go ahead, Nelson.
"What has happened to America?
"People have been asking that question a lot lately.
"That's why I've decided to look for a solution.
"You see, I sense that if there were a solution, "or solutions, "the energy that went into asking that question "could be channeled into the search for other solutions to other questions".
Mork!
That was my grabber.
Oh.
Bravo.
Author, author.
I just Just started.
Oh.
Um, how much longer is that?
It runs for a full hour.
Want me to read faster?
You got a full hour on television?
Well, my, uh, opponents in the upcoming election were on a televised debate.
Somehow I was snubbed.
I suspect that the station manager is like this with the other 12 candidates.
Oh.
So you got equal time from the FCC?
Mind, you don't have to spell it.
We're all adults here.
The only snag is Is that, uh, they gave me 7:00 Saturday morning.
Not exactly a prime-o time-o.
Not exactly?
There's nobody watching TV except kids.
I'm hoping that they like what I say about America and how to fix her, and then they'll tell their parents to vote for me.
Nelson, I don't think that a political speech is exactly what kids want to listen to.
Well, you could always do it in a chicken suit.
If you want the kids to pay attention to you, you've got to talk about something they're interested in.
I don't know what kids want to hear.
Hang, it's been years since I was a cute little tyke.
Tell you what.
I can help you out.
I could go to the daycare center and ask the tykes and tykettes what they want to see on Saturday morning besides, : "Yah!
Whoa"!
: "Ba-dee-ba-dee-ba-dee-ba-dee, that's all folks".
I appreciate that, Mork.
Thanks a lot.
Mindy, don't let him go.
He's one special guy.
Yes, he is.
Well, see you later, Nelson.
Okay, see you guys later.
Okay.
Ta-ta.
Bye.
Well, Mind, I was gonna take that up to the attic, unless you would like it as a little knickknack or a tchotchke.
Well, Mork, my knickknack shelf has a one-ton weight limit.
I wanna know how you'll get that upstairs.
It was no trouble bringing it home.
Well, not exactly no trouble.
You know that taco stand at the bottom of that real steep hill?
Yes.
Well, it has a drive-through service now.
That's a nice pinecone turkey you're making, Grant.
Thanks, Mrs. Thompson.
Mrs. Thompson, can you jump sideways in checkers?
No, Pamela.
Shazbat!
Well, Jack, this is an interesting painting.
You know what it is?
A tree.
It's a picture of you.
You know, it does sort of look like me, except for that branch growing out of my ear.
I knew you'd like it.
Greetings, munchkins.
Nanu, nanu!
Aw, shucks and wazoo.
The kids sure have taken to you, Mork.
Oh, I like them too.
I'd like to rent one if I could.
I also feel good about helping working moms.
Well, I'll be in my office.
Have fun.
Thank you.
Picasso, eh?
Mork, would you do that magic trick again?
Yeah!
All right, no pressure.
I can drink like that.
You can?
Yes, but I do it with my mouth.
Oh, sleight of tongue, eh?
Munchkins, I-I need your help.
I have to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.
See, I have this friend who's giving a speech on Saturday-morning television.
He likes to know what you think What would you like him to say?
Nothing.
Yeah, we get enough speeches at home.
Well, what would you like to see on Saturday mornings?
The Dallas cheerleaders.
I like puppets.
I like jokes.
Rock 'n' roll!
I'd like to see Dick Cavett interview the prime minister of Rhodesia.
Pardon me?
I can't help it.
I'm gifted.
I wanna find out where babies come from.
Well, if you find out, will you tell me?
They also want to see you juggle, and some magic, lion taming.
Sure.
You have a talent.
I can't do nary a thing on that list.
Nelson was never what you might call the entertainer of the family.
Last time I got applause is when I used the potty without being reminded.
I think I just better go with my strength: Dull speeches.
The little rug rats don't want to watch me, let 'em switch to Mooky the Mongoose.
You don't have to fill this entire hour by yourself, do you?
What are you driving at?
Well, maybe we could help.
I mean, we've got friends.
Yeah, I know some guys in a band and And Remo tells jokes.
Yeah, Mindy can sing.
And Jeanie dances.
Listen to us.
We sound like an old Judy Garland/ Mickey Rooney movie.
: Kids, let's put on a show!
With a little imagination, we could turn the new theater into an old barn!
I don't know.
It sounds kind of wacky.
Who'd want to watch a bunch of amateurs put on a show?
Peeping Toms.
I guess it is kind of a silly idea.
What am I gonna do?
Come on, Nelson, you can't give up.
Mind, we've got to help him.
Nelson, you might not have to be that professional at 7 in the morning.
Do you really think if I put on a kids' show, people would like me?
Yeah.
Maybe.
By gum, let's do it.
It'll be Nelson Flavor's gift to the children of Boulder.
Oh, huzzah, huzzah!
Let's go for the gusto!
I can see Oh, there's There's one problem.
What?
Well, I'll miss Mooky the Mongoose.
Oh, you.
You nutty guy!
Okay, who wants to go next?
Well, I'll give it a try.
Thanks.
Ooh.
Good.
Whoa.
Whoo.
Yea!
I learned to juggle in the Army.
I used to do this with hand grenades.
That's how I got out.
La-la-la  This could be the start of something small.
I think the audience will enjoy it.
What audience?
I invited the kids from the daycare center.
I hope you don't mind, Nelson.
Ah, that's okay.
What's wrong, Nelson?
Well, it's just that everybody's got something nifty to do except me.
If it goes well, the kids will think you're the next best thing to dead bugs.
You're a good buddy, Mork.
I'm glad I appointed you to be the host.
Mork is gonna host the entire hour?
Well, he has a firm grasp of juvenile-attitude preference.
He means Mork knows what kids like.
Yeah.
I think they'll like what I'm doing.
I'm gonna start it like this.
: Have a beautiful day Have a wonderful day Hello, neighbors.
Welcome to my neighborhood.
Do you like my sweater?
It's ten years old.
I got it at the ABC thrift shop.
Well, today we're gonna learn lots of wonderful things.
We're gonna learn why cows moo for certain bulls.
And the big lesson for today is how to make your cat longer.
Can you say, "Meow-w"?
: Thank you, Uncle Remo, for those wonderful knock-knock jokes.
Weren't those funny, boys and girls?
I guess not, huh?
Come on over to my neighborhood now.
There's someone special I'd like you to meet.
Thank you, Mr. Piano Man, for tinkling on the keys.
Let's see if my friend's home.
Mr. Weasel?
I'll see if he's in there.
I guess he is.
Come on out, Mr. Weasel.
Here he is.
Hello, Mr. Weasel.
: Hi, Mr. Mork.
Nice to be on your show.
Yeah.
What are you here for today?
Why have you come over to my neighborhood?
Because I want to talk to you about a wonderful man called Nelson Flavor.
Well, that'd be wonderful.
Let's sit down and chat.
We'll talk about it.
What's this man Nelson Whoa!
There goes the neighborhood.
Oh, yeah.
Well, Mr. Weasel, you'll have to give a big introduction while I scrape the neighbors off my pants.
You ready?
Yes, Mr. Mork.
Right here on our show, let's bring her out here right now.
Miss Mindy McConnell!
Come on out!
Put a big hand together, kids!
Yea!
Okay, now, I'm going to teach you all a little lesson, so I want you all to gather around.
And I want you to repeat after me  I won't grow up  I won't grow up I don't wanna go to school  I don't wanna go to school Just to learn To be a parrot  Just to learn to be a parrot And recite a silly rule  And recite a silly rule If growing up Means it would be Beneath my dignity To climb a tree I'll never grow up Never grow up Never grow u-up, not me Not I Not me  Not me  I won't grow up  I won't grow up I don't wanna wear a tie  I don't wanna wear a tie Or a serious expression  Or a serious expression In the middle of July  In the middle of July And if it means I must prepare To shoulder burdens With a worried air I'll never grow up Never grow up Never grow u-up, so there Not I Not me  So there Never gonna be a man I won't I'd like to see somebody Try and make me Anyone who wants to try And make me turn into a man Catch me if you can I won't grow up  I won't grow up Not a penny will I pinch  Not a penny will I pinch I will never grow A mustache  I will never grow a mustache Or a fraction of an inch  Or a fraction of an inch 'Cause growing up Is awfuller Than all the awful things That ever were I'll never grow up Never grow up Never grow u-up, no, sir Not I Not me  No, sir So there And now for the second movement of the Frog Lake ballet.
We'll be back to our show in just a moment, but first, this important message.
I'd like to talk to you about a future leader of this country.
Our graphics courtesy of the Pinetree Daycare Center.
Yea!
I'm talking about Nelson Flavor, a man of substance.
Why do I like him?
Because he has a vision of what America should be.
So remember this face.
Our future depends on it.
And, uh, tell your folks Remo sent you.
: Give me another soda, Joe.
That's your fourth.
Don't you think you had enough?
I'm drinking to forget, Joe.
Please, Billy, you know what it does to your complexion.
Ah.
I don't care.
I wanna drown my sorrows.
Care to talk about it?
Oh, all right.
It's this girl named Susie.
She sits across from me in Miss Zimmerman's class.
You like her?
Maybe.
Does she like you?
Give me the soda.
I get it.
A classic case of unrequited like.
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
Well, the trouble is Well, she likes a guy named Mikie Farquaharquaharquahar.
How do you know?
Well, she throws spitballs at him and calls him a "neeny brain".
Wanna know a secret, Billy?
When I was your age, I liked someone too.
Her name was Mary Lou.
She was special.
When I was with her, I felt 4 feet tall.
I wanted to share everything I had with her.
But she broke up with me because she didn't like what I gave her for Christmas.
Well, what did you give her?
Chicken pox.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Doggone, that's the way I like to see you, Billy.
Oh, thanks, Joe, I I think I can make it now.
Ah Here you go, you big palooka.
Buy yourself a Tonka toy.
: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nanu, nanu, munchkins.
Nanu, nanu!
Ha, ha.
You got it.
Let's get down.
Get back up again.
We're gonna sing some music right now for ya, but about things that make you feel bad.
If somethin' makes you feel bad, when I point my magic finger at you, you say, "Shazbat".
That's why we're gonna wail "The Shazbat Blues".
Your mama tells you To cut out the sweets Then she tells you To eat your beets Heh-heh.
What's that make you feel, little ones?
Shazbat!
Ha-ha-ha!
You got it now.
"Don't jump fences "Don't climb trees "Don't sleep with the dog Or else you'll get fleas" Ha-ha.
What's this world full of, little munchkins?
Shazbat!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
We're on a roll now.
Green, green veggies Are good for you Tell me how come They don't make Ice-cream stew Ow!
What's that we're talkin' about?
You know.
Shazbat!
Yo!
You ask your mama If you came from the stork She says "No, little baby : You came from a test tube Topped with a cork" Ha-ha-ha!
That's why I'm singin' The  Shazbat!
Blu-u-es   My name is Nelson Flavor.
"What has happened to America?
People have been asking that" I can't do this speech.
This is the wrong time and place.
You know why?
Because you've all helped me remember what it's like to be a kid again.
I've had the best morning of my entire life.
I can't give a speech and wreck all the fun now.
Yea!
They love me!
They're gonna tell their parents!
People are gonna vote for this chicken yet!
Glory, glory Nelson Flavor His truth goes Marching on-n  Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
: Mork calling Orson.
Oh, there's Your Humpty Dumptyness.
Just give me your report, Mork.
: Yes, sir.
This week, sir, I learned about teamwork.
My friend Nelson Flavor asked for an hour of television time, but once he got it, he didn't know what to do with it, so his friends and I had to bail him out.
Tell me, how did you help your friend?
Well, I hosted his television show.
You know, like:  And, uh, it was for children.
They really seemed to enjoy it.
Children?
Sir.
What do you know about children, Mork?
Well, sir, some people think of them as children, but I prefer to think of them as humans.
There's an older phrase, sir, that says, "Children should be seen and not heard".
But I think if that really happened, the silence would be deafening.
But children's minds aren't fully developed yet.
Isn't it best they be kept in their place?
Sir.
Just because they're children doesn't mean they don't have anything of value to say.
I mean, give 'em a chance.
Listen to them.
If you're only gonna talk down to them, how can you expect them to look up to you?
Well, sir, until next week, : Can you say, "Nanu, nanu"?
I think you can.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Nanu, nanu!
Come on in, Jeanie.
Hi.
Hi.
You want something to eat before we go?
Oh, no, thanks.
Oh, you're not gonna believe this, but Remo made breakfast for me in bed this morning.
Mork did that for me once.
It was a real surprise sliding under the covers and into a bowl of oatmeal.
Oh, hi.
Oh!
What was that?
MINDY : Oh, no!
Your teeth are gone.
Oh, no, no.
This is just paper.
I just wanted to look like all the other hockey players.
So how'd you enjoy your first game?
Well, it was kind of strange.
As near as I can figure out, the object of the game is to wait until the referee drops the puck on the ice and hit the guy next to you.
Then you skate around for two hours, trip people till you get a stick through the skull.
I'd love to stay around here and swap a lot of jock stories, but I've got a job interview to get ready for.
Maybe they'll make me a congressman.
I wonder where Mork is.
He was supposed to meet me here over a half an hour ago.
Boy, I hope that means he's found a job.
Oh, what kind of job is he looking for?
Anything that'll pay him enough to live on.
He's looking in the wrong country.
Ta-da!
Presenting the first official Remo DaVinci wedding cake.
Remo, that's really nice.
It's for the reception here tomorrow.
Note the unique corkscrew construction.
"Why"?
you may ask.
Allow me to demonstrate.
VoilÃ !
Do you dig the symbolism?
I'm not quite sure.
Marriage is like a ride down a wedding cake.
You know, you might be educated.
I'm deep.
Remo, it's just that I think it's a little silly to have a wedding reception in a delicatessen.
I want people to look upon me as more than a tongue-and-tuna man.
This is our chance to be a class operation.
I never heard that one on Fantasy Island.
Come on and I'll help you decorate the Betty Crocker Speedway.
How would you like you tongue depressed?
How would you like a knackwurst up your nose?
Mork, what happened?
Mindy, you don't want to talk to me.
I'm spider spit.
Oh, I'm I'm not fit to oil your Olay.
You didn't get the job.
No, it was worse.
I got it.
But then I Then I lost it because of my suspenders.
What are you talking about?
There were 32 little homicidal midgets masquerading as children.
They bit me in places I can't even reach.
Well, where did you get all the green paint?
Never play leapfrog with a child who's into realism.
What does this all have to do with your suspenders?
Well, I left them wrapped around his little head.
As I left, I saw him going: : "Help me!
Help me"!
Well, I'm sorry you had such a rough day.
Mindy, what's the matter with me?
I There's gotta be something I can do.
There's gotta be a job.
I know it.
Dressed like this, I could be a punk comedian.
Knock-knock.
Who's there?
Who cares?
Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, Mork.
Don't give up.
I know there's a job out there somewhere.
There's got to be.
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
Excuse me.
Uh, is Mr. DaVinci here?
Oh, yes, he is, Father.
He's in the back.
Thank you.
Why do you call him "Father"?
Well, because everyone calls him Father.
Boy, he must be a real busy guy.
No.
No, Mork.
He's with the Church.
You know, as a priest.
Uh, his job is to help people.
Oh, maybe he can get me some paint remover.
Don't worry about a thing, Father.
I'm gonna provide the best possible wedding reception for the future Winslows.
Well, I just want to make sure they don't start their marriage off on the wrong foot.
Just leave everything to Mr. Remo of Boulder.
I'm gonna create the perfect nuptial atmosphere.
See these salamis back here?
Mm-hm.
I'm gonna hang bells on them.
And I'm gonna have this big Cupid come down from the ceiling.
Fully dressed, Father.
Fully dressed.
Oh, yes, uh, well, you better do your best.
Don't force me to make any threatening prayers.
Got you, Padre.
Got you.
Excuse me, everyone.
Father?
Ah, how do you do?
I'm Father Denny.
I'm Mork, the screwup.
Is it true that you help people?
Well, I try to help people.
Why, do you have a problem?
Um, excuse me, Father, but Mork's depressed because he can't hold a job.
And he feels like a loser.
Oh, well, how do you think I felt when TIME magazine announced that, uh, God was dead?
Of course, it just turned out to be a rumor after all.
Well, is there any way you can help me, Father?
Well, I could give you a bit of advice.
When you're standing there at home plate, it doesn't matter whether you're a slugger or a bunter.
You've got to lean into the ball.
Thanks, Father.
That kind of helps.
That's from my sermon to the newlyweds.
Uh, now, uh, do you really want to work?
Oh, yes, sir.
I don't want to be a hickey on the neck of life.
That's very poetic, Mork.
Uh Remo.
Yes, Father?
Why don't you give this boy a job?
: You mean Mork?
Look, I love him, Father.
I I really love him, but, um, the last time I asked him to help me, he used the exhaust fan to slice bologna.
I had sandwiches three blocks away.
Well, uh, could you just, uh, give him something to do for the reception?
You'd be helping him a lot.
I think I remember hearing that God helps those who help themselves.
Well, maybe you also heard that he can be a little rough on those that don't help others.
You get my drift?
Oh, I get it.
He's gonna make me an offer I can't refuse.
: Right.
Knife.
Knife.
Fork.
Fork.
Mayo.
Mayo.
Mork?
Hold the mayo.
Did you take out the garbage like I asked you?
No, the roaches aren't finished with it yet.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm classing the joint up so that Father Denny doesn't put a curse on me.
Oh, he's into voodoo.
I know about that.
: The drums, they make me sweat.
: Shut up and drink your quinine.
Oh, how you doing, fellas?
Hi, Father.
Oh, I really like what you've done with the place.
Really, Father?
No, not really.
Actually, a priest has to kind of fib every now and then too.
Don't worry, Father.
Everything's gonna be all right because I'm in charge of les dÃ©corations.
Well, what do you have in mind?
Let me show you.
It's my amazing, new creation.
It's a centerpiece, carved completely out of chopped liver, of the bride and groom.
Do you like where I put the pickle?
Nobody's ever asked me that question before.
Laurie, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to be married in two hours.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
This is amazing.
I can see her clear as day.
What do you mean?
You can't see the bride before she's married.
Father, I'm getting cold feet.
Well, you can use my socks if you want.
Father, I don't know if If I want to give up my freedom.
Oh, well, let's sit down over here and discuss this, all right?
Here.
Take a seat.
Now  Pace, pace, pace, pace.
Ecap, ecap, ecap, ecap.
Pace, pace, pace Hi.
Oh, you're finally home.
Yeah.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I wanted to buy a few things and I lost track of time.
Oh.
Did you miss me?
No, but I have some really exciting news for you.
Oh, great.
Tell me your news.
No, you tell me your news first.
I don't have any news.
Why do I have to do everything around here?
Mork, your news?
All right.
I've decided what I want to do with my life.
Oh, that's the spirit.
Close.
I want to be a priest.
That's ludicrous.
I know.
Isn't it wonderful?
After seeing Father Denny yesterday, I realized what I really want to do.
Why?
Well, because I want to celebrate.
Celebrate what?
I don't know.
Whatever Father Denny celebrates.
Mork, Father Denny didn't say he celebrates.
He said he's celibate.
What's that mean?
It means that he's married to the Church.
Oh, you're gonna tell me that?
Wow, where's he gonna get a ring that big, huh?
Mork, you can't be a priest.
Why not, Mindy?
They do what I want to do.
They help people, they solve problems, they play bingo.
Yeah, but, Mork, sometimes those problems are a matter of life and death, and a priest can only deal with them through his faith.
Look, Mork, tomorrow morning, I'll take you to the church myself, and Father Denny will explain to you why you can't become a priest.
Oh, Mindy, don't you see all the advantages of it, though?
You get to wear a black habit.
I can dress up like Johnny Cash.
: Hi, I'm Father Mork.
: Besides, I've seen all the movies about priests.
"Tommy, give me that gun you meshugenah.
Put it down".
And there's And there's no such thing as a bad boy.
Only great girls.
And besides, it It's part of a worldwide franchise.
Just look for the golden steeple.
Over 8 billion souls.
There's great possibilities.
A little puff of smoke, and there's no place like Rome, there's no place like Rome.
There I am on the Vatican.
Play ball!
Oh, this place is wonderful.
Real beautiful.
The windows don't match, but it's still neat.
Oh, don't they know there's an energy crisis?
They're wasting precious wax, here.
Whoa, great place for an echo.
Hello!
Excuse me, Father.
You shouldn't be yelling in church.
Why not?
It's a great echo.
Anyway, I have to talk to you, Father.
Oh, don't call me Father.
Don't be so formal.
Call me Pops.
Okay, Pops, um I've got kind of a problem.
Well, tell me your problem.
Perhaps we can solve it.
I've been sitting over there in that pew, and The first thing you have to do is move to a cleaner seat.
I was kind of thinking about the things I've been writing on the bus-station walls.
Oh, I've seen some of your stuff.
I really enjoy it.
"Gate 13," "Ladies," and "The Marines are looking for a few good men".
I think somebody else writes that stuff.
The things I write are more along the lines of, uh  Oh, there should be flies buzzing around you.
I know.
What I don't know is how I can be forgiven.
Well, first of all, you have to start all over again.
Erase that stuff and put something people want to read, like, "Nuclear energy cures acne," or "Frank Sinatra's made his last comeback".
Yeah, I'll do that right away.
Thank you, Fath Uh, Pops.
Well, excuse me, son.
Do you know where I can find Father Denny?
I don't know.
He can't be here all the time.
I think it's his disco night.
I guess I better call him at home then.
Thank you.
Now, let's see.
Where's the phone?
Oh, excuse me please, Father.
What can I do for you, my son?
Well, you must be the new priest.
My, aren't you awfully young.
Well, come back in a year, I'll be a little older.
Ar-ar!
Bless you, Father.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Bless you, Father.
Bless you.
Bless you.
Bless you!
Let's see.
Go to the phone.
No dime.
Thank you.
Now, let's see Whoa!
You'd think this was New York.
Somebody ripped off the phone!
It's so dark.
I can't see You did what with whom?
Hey, wait, hold on.
Wait a minute!
I got a story for you.
Wait, come back!
Hey, wait.
It's a story.
It's a great joke.
Come on Hey, I listened to your story.
Wait.
Must be a full moon.
Here you are.
I I need a priest to give the last rites.
Well, this is a democracy.
You always have rights, as long as you vote.
Wait a minute.
You act like you don't know what last rites are.
Oh, of course, I do, my son.
Last rites is when you add the fabric softener.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's the last rinse.
First it was funny newscasters, now it's funny priests.
Last rites is what a priest says when someone is dying.
Someone's dying?
Yeah.
Me.
From what?
From suicide.
I'm gonna kill myself.
Why?
I have nothing to live for.
Don't you realize that living is a precious thing?
It's the meat in the sandwich of life.
It's my life.
I can have it here or to go.
Well, I guess it's bad taste to say good luck, so ciao.
Hey, a-a-aren't you even gonna try to talk me out of it?
Why?
You said it was your life.
I guess all you have to do is go up to the plate of life and bunt.
I don't believe this.
Why?
Well, I stand here and tell you I'm gonna kill myself, and you don't even try to help me.
You want help?
All right.
I It doesn't sound like the right thing, but I'll give you some help.
Sit down, my son.
Well, let's see.
You have to kill yourself.
Here's a good way.
Wear a tutu and go into a leather bar.
Oh, here's another one.
Here's another one.
You try and smoke a real camel.
I knew I should have gone to St. Paul's.
No, no, here's a really good one.
You go upstairs and hang in the big church bell.
I go and play "Jingle Bells".
By the time I get to "in a one-horse open sleigh," you're a dead ringer.
No, wait!
Why don't you try and slip into a pair of water moccasins?
Let me out of here.
DÃ©jÃ  pew.
What are you doing dressed like that?
Well, I happened to run into a Jesuit garage sale.
Well, actually, Mindy, I just want to be dressed correctly when we go to see Father Denny.
Somehow I don't think that's appropriate.
Well, you're right.
Basic black is a little plain.
Can I borrow your pearls?
Look, Mork, I don't mind going to the church with you this morning, but I really wish you'd try and dress like a normal person and just try to fit in.
I fit in last night.
What do you mean you fit in last night?
Oh, dopey me.
You went to St. Peter's last night like that?
Yes, but it's all right, though.
I I helped this man to commit suicide.
You what?
Well, he He didn't know how to do it, so I gave him 50 ways to meet his maker.
Oh, no, Mork.
You might have really done it this time.
Come on.
We're gonna go see Father Denny.
Ah, good morning, Mindy and Father Mork?
Uh, Father Denny, Mork has a confession to make.
Confession.
Well, uh, would you like to step into my office?
I was in there last night.
You should know someone ripped off your phone.
You were here last night?
Were you dressed like that?
Well, that's kind of what he wants to confess.
Well, um, I want to be a priest.
You want to be a priest?
Do you think you have a genuine calling?
No, just a black dress.
But I came in here last night to apply for a job and I was trying to fill out the application, and people started coming to me for help.
Uh, well, you see, ahem, I guess, apparently, last night, someone came in on the verge of suicide and Suicide?
What was his name?
What did he look like?
I don't commit to memory people who are not gonna make it.
Do you realize you could've been the cause of someone's death just because you wanted to play priest?
I wanted to be a priest just like you.
But I've spent six years studying to be a priest.
Look, son, it's no sin to be a nitwit.
But if you're gonna go around giving out counsel and advice without the tools of education and experience, you could do more harm than good.
All right, you've done something unforgivable.
There's no excuse.
I want you to get in there and take that cassock off right now.
With all these buttons in the dark?
Go!
Well, hasn't the Church ever heard of a zipper?
Oh!
I'm really sorry about this, Father Denny.
It's just that Mork is so impressionable, and he really did want to be a priest.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for the young priest who was on duty here last night.
Uh, he's, uh, no longer with St. Peter's.
Uh, yeah, he was only a temporary.
They have temporary priests?
Sure, they're kind of like Kelly Girls, only they carry rosary beads instead of little white gloves.
Well, I I wish he were here, because I wanted to thank him for saving my life.
He saved your life?
Yeah.
I came in here last night all ready to commit suicide.
I never expected a priest to give me advice on how to kill myself.
It was the one thing I wasn't prepared for.
Well, how do you feel about suicide now?
Oh, suicide's no answer.
And he made me realize just how foolish I was being.
No kidding?
If you ever see him again, please tell him that he's a He's a great priest and a wonderful judge of human nature.
All right, Mork.
Now, you tried your best to throw that man out at the plate, but luckily he was able to slide into home on his own safely.
It seems that what you said to that man last night was exactly what he needed to hear.
In fact, you actually saved his life.
I did?
Yes.
Now I have just one thing to say to you.
Well, thank you.
You do it again, and I'm gonna kick your cassock from here to kingdom come!
You know, what I don't understand is why you did it in the first place.
Well, I don't seem to be able to do anything right, and I I saw the way you respected Father Denny.
And I thought if I became a priest, you'd respect me too.
Oh, Mork.
I respect you more than any person I know.
Well, I can't seem to get a job.
I don't even make it through job interviews.
Oh, Mork.
But what you have is the integrity to be yourself.
I mean, even when it means you're out of step with the entire planet.
And I think that's really special.
Yeah.
At least I've realized now that I I don't want to be a priest.
Good.
I'm glad you finally understand.
I want to become a nun.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
: Mork calling Orson Come in, Orson Mork calling Orson Come in, he who is fatter Than all before him  What now, my Mork?
Ah, Orson, it's been a wonderful week.
I've learned to have faith in myself.
That's all any person needs, Mork.
No, sir.
Not on Earth, it isn't.
You see, on Earth, they have the bigger, the jumbo size.
It's called faith in God.
Do all Earthlings believe in God?
Most of them do, sir, especially when things get real hairy.
But how can they believe in something that science cannot prove?
Oh, that's the amazing part, sir.
Because you see, that's where something called "faith" comes in.
You see, many people believe in God even though they don't see him, and they're called religious.
Then there are a few people who believe and they do see him.
What are they called?
Prophets or meshugenahs.
Strange, these Earthlings.
They need to believe in something they cannot see.
I know, sir.
But they don't have to see it.
They feel it in their souls.
What's a soul?
I don't know.
No one knows what it is or Or where it is.
Let me get this straight: On Earth, faith is the belief in something you can't see, which you feel in a place you can't feel.
You got it, big boy.
I need a drink.
Oh, come on, Orson.
It's not that hard.
All one has to do to prove one's faith is to look up in the sky.
For example, where do stars come from?
They were created long ago by natural forces.
How do you know?
Were you there?
Of course not.
It's a scientific theory.
You just have to accept it.
On faith.
Well, uh Uh, kind of.
Uh What do you believe, Mork?
Well, sir, I believe that the universe is one great big ball.
And what created that ball?
I don't know, sir.
All I know is that if God didn't, at least he lets us play with it and hopes that we don't fumble.
So until next week, this is Mork signing off.
Nanu, nanu.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Nanu, nanu!
Mork, where have you been?
I went to the supermarket like you told me.
Yeah, but that was over an hour ago.
All you were supposed to get was a carton of milk.
I know, but boy, are you in for a surprise.
I don't have time for surprises right now.
Oh, you mean, you don't have time for the new candy?
Three Mile Mints, the nuclear chocolate?
They melt down, but not in your mouth.
Here we go, a little eyewash.
Eyewash?
Yeah, that's the easy part.
The hard part's hanging them out to dry.
Some disposable diapers.
Mork, I don't have a baby.
Oh, that's why they're disposable.
Here I have a little birdseed so now we can grow a canary.
Oh, here we have Bi-Gel: The new anti-acid that goes both ways.
Oh, no, a squash.
Let's see.
Oh, faulty advertising.
Mr. Nader will hear about that.
Now, for the gourmet with no teeth: Liquid Steak.
A good meal is just a suck away.
Mork.
Here we have a virgin wool sweater.
Ha!
How do they know it's a virgin?
Mm-hm.
And now, I bought something called Sugarcoated Jimmys.
Just add milk, and the economy inflates.
And we have this brand-new insecticide.
It says here, "Guaranteed to kill bugs".
Oops.
There's one now.
A-ha!
Mork.
All I wanted was a carton of milk.
I've gotta whip these potatoes.
Whipped potatoes.
All we need is rack of lamb, we'll have a real kinky meal.
You wanted milk?
Yes.
I have brought you the history of milk.
We have your white plain milk.
We have your chocolate milk.
Yeah, my main lactose, what's happenin'?
Here's milk.
We have the old milk.
We have some sour milk.
Ooh, Icky-ick.
And then the history in the ghost of milk past.
You bought every kind there is.
Yes.
Well, I thought to fit in society, you have to be a consumer, so I jumped in with both feet.
You'll have to learn to keep your feet out of your wallet.
How?
Even when I was leaving the store, they were still saying, "Bye".
Mork, you're gonna have to develop better judgment.
I mean, the average Earthling doesn't become a buy-aholic.
Mindy, I've never been exposed to advertising before.
I thought you picked up our TV signals up on Ork.
Well, we do, but we're not stupid.
We divert the commercials to other planets.
That's why all UFOs come here.
They're coming here to shop.
See?
You're fairly new at it.
You don't know how to handle it.
You better learn how to handle it before you spend us out of house and home.
But I thought advertising was good for you.
Without it, how can you know what you cannot live without?
Mork, I think you ought to lay off advertising for a while.
I mean, not just the TV, but the radio, newspapers and these magazines.
I swear, I only buy them for the naked ladies.
Yeah?
Then how come there's crumbs all over these ads?
She was well-bred.
No, I'm serious.
I'm worried about you.
You're starting to lose control of yourself.
Me, lose control?
Ar-ar-ar-ar!
You know  Oh, it's my other groceries.
Thank you.
Oh, here's a little something for you, and don't squeeze it all in one place.
That's it.
No more ads for you.
Well, that's all right.
I still have Mr. Video.
Ah, and no more TV, either.
Oh.
Uh Thank you.
Oh, heavy sigh.
Here I am in a media society, forced to sit on my ads.
Oh, that must be Remo.
Will you get that for me?
Hope it's a traveling salesman.
Hey, Morko!
Hey, Remo!
Hey, Morko!
Hey, Remo-o!
Hey, Morko!
Hey, Remo!
Hey!
Don't do that.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry about my sister Jeanie, but, uh, she couldn't pass up the chance to see her first operation.
Yeah.
Do you think she'll drop by later?
No.
Could you eat after somebody handed you an adenoid?
Ha!
Get it?
An adenoid.
Ar-ar-ar.
Speaking of eating, I brought you something for dinner.
Oh, thanks.
It's just what we need.
A nice bottle of ketchup.
Yes, and it goes well with either meat or fish.
Here.
Oh, Red Nun.
Mm.
It's full-bodied and a good week.
I'll put it on ice.
Well, we can eat as soon as my frozen peas and pearl onions are done.
Oh, I love those exotic vegetables.
Yeah.
Why don't you make yourself at home?
You really do?
Yeah.
That's wonderful, because 50 years ago, Clarence Birds Eye had a dream and froze it.
He was the first man to make a million dollars from frigidity.
What's he talking about?
Um, Mork's really into commercials.
Well, it's only because I want the best for those I care about.
Here's to good friends.
Watch it, Mork.
You're beginning to think in 30-second blurbs.
Please, Mindy, Let me watch just a little bit of TV, please.
Just a touch of video in the night.
Come on.
Please, please, with sugar substitute on top.
Please, Mindy, please.
Please.
No, Mork.
Um, he has no sales resistance.
That's the trouble with the world today.
People don't know what they want.
But not this fella.
Not Remo DaVinci.
I never buy anything I don't need.
You ought to learn that.
Oh, yeah?
What about that strange aftershave you wear?
What's so strange about English Vinyl?
Nothing, if you don't mind smelling like a chair.
It's a man's scent, Mindy.
Mm.
Maybe there's a reason men wanna smell like a chair.
The reason is the overstuffed girl in the commercial.
That's right.
I like her too.
What's the matter with him?
Mork, are you all right?
Oh, sure, I'm all right.
Heh-heh.
She thinks I'm hooked on ads and commercials.
Me, hooked on TV.
Ar-ar.
Chortle, chortle.
I mean, I can go weeks without seeing them.
Days, eons, epics, light years.
Why do I have to start now?
Please!
Please!
Please!
Please, let me just watch a little bit of TV, please.
Just a touch of video.
I miss the little mountain lion going:  And the little dough boy going:  And the Ty-D-Bol man going, "Dive!
Dive"!
Please, Mindy!
I'm going, "Chow, chow, chow!
: Chow, chow, chow!
Chow, chow, chow"!
Argh!
Plop plop, fizz fizz, Oh, what a relief it is Please, Mindy!
Can't you see it?
Now the Lookieloo's looking for Mr. Goodwrench.
Frank Gifford looking for Jimmy Hoffa in a dry sack on the rocks.
Did you see it?
Mindy, look!
Ha ha!
ANNOUNCER : Excite your taste buds with the super soft drink.
It's cool and refreshing   : I hate the taste of kapok.
Who is it?
The invisible man.
I can't see you.
Aren't you going to ask me in?
Oh, I-I thought you were joking.
Please come Ar.
You!
What are you doing here?
It's after midnight.
Well, good, old, lovable Mr. Bickley, I was passing by, and I smelled your television on.
I thought I'd come in and watch a little bit with you, maybe just a few minutes.
Why don't you watch upstairs?
Well, your ceiling's in the way.
I mean, why don't you watch your own set?
Mindy won't let me because I'm It's no real problem, but now, I'm going through cold video.
Can I just stay for a while?
Not now.
Come on, man.
Oh, come on, man.
Don't you?
Who is it?
Bourbon Delight.
Come in.
I thought I threw you out.
Oh, well, I can go back upstairs and practice tap dancing in my roller skates if you like.
All right, come in, but be quiet.
Thank you.
What are you watching?
Invasion of the Body Grabbers.
The original and scarier version.
What's it about?
About alien beings who come down to Earth.
Oh, a documentary.
Look!
My lord, they've got him!
What are they gonna do with him?
They come here to take over our minds and bodies and control us.
Why?
Shh!
That's not a shh, shh.
That's a drunken snake.
We'll return Oh, now look what you did.
You kept blabbing all through the movie.
Now the commercial is on.
Quiet!
Quiet!
It's just a commercial.
Look, hers is definitely whiter.
Take the shirt!
Take the shirt!
You're a bozo.
Oh, let me change the channel and find another commercial.
Whoa, son of a gun, if she suddenly isn't shapelier.
Look at that.
Give me that.
Oh, now, darn, the movie started already.
Oh, bummer.
Now I won't know whose mind is being controlled and whose isn't.
Let me look for some more commercials then.
If your pet refuses No wonder he's finicky.
He's been dead for over a year.
That does it.
The only place to watch this show is in bed.
Oh.
Okey-dokey.
I'll go fluff up our pillows.
Go on, get out of here and go to bed!
Hm, it's getting late.
I wonder if Mindy's asleep.
Oh, look at that.
Mindy's bear.
Hi, Teddy.
Time for you to be in bed.
Whoa, ozone.
She's asleep.
I'm a free man again.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Time for a little advertising.
Here we go.
Whoa, Zen advertising.
Oh, what good are these magazines?
There's nothing in 'em but articles.
Oh, wait.
Ha-ha.
A little mondo-video then.
Real low so the slasher can't hear.
We'll be back in a moment with the exciting conclusion of the Invasion of the Body Grabbers, but first, this word.
Friends, can I have your attention?
Your attention, please.
That includes you, fella, sleeping on the couch.
Who, me?
Yes, you.
How'd you like to have everything you've ever dreamed of?
Sure.
That sounds pretty wonderful.
Then come join me in the Promised Land.
Will I need shots?
Come, Mork.
We've been waiting for you.
Come, Mork.
I think you're going to like it here, Mork.
Welcome, Mork.
I'm Mr. Persuasion, your TV guide.
Where am I?
This is the Promised Land, where everyone has everything they need to be happy and content.
Friends, we have a guest.
Hi!
They look a lot like Ray Walston.
Now, why don't you just mingle and hear the interesting words they have to say?
I'll be back after their short messages.
Hello.
I'm Mrs. L.W. from Bangor, Maine.
Nanu, nanu.
Look at my hands.
Oh, nice.
Now look at her hands.
Mm.
Nice.
Now, which one of us would you say is the mother and which one is the daughter?
I'd say she looks like a mother.
Wrong.
I'm the mother.
My hands used to be rough and red.
Then I discovered Sparkle Dish.
Whoa.
I just love the way my hands feel now.
Me too.
I think I'll keep her.
Get some today.
I thought you were with him.
Wait.
Can I talk to you about irregularity?
Sure.
We'll talk over a prune Danish, but right now, I've gotta run.
Hi, mister.
Hello, little fella.
Fun, aren't they?
Yes.
But they grow up so quickly.
And I'm going to see that he grows up right.
I care about my child, and that's why I give him Princess Gooballs.
Here, have one.
Thank you.
The ingredients in each gooball are pure and provide much-needed energy and even may build a bone or two.
Mm-mm.
Hiya, pal.
Put her there.
I can't.
I'm covered in gooball.
Well, you could if you used one of these.
Wonder Wipes.
One wipe removes grease, grime, dirt, and that gooey, sticky stuff.
You know, I use 100 of these every night instead of taking a shower.
Would you believe I'm waxing my floor at this very moment?
No, I wouldn't really.
Well, step this way.
Now I would.
New Wax N Slide floor polish.
No need to buff when people's pants bottoms will do the job.
You people all look so happy here.
Oh, well, the joy of living here is that for every problem, there's a solution, or a gel.
What's your problem?
Flaking, itching, peeling?
No.
Split ends.
Oh, you sell girdles.
Mork, it's me, Mindy.
Run while you've got the chance.
Your life is in danger here.
Oh, no, it's not.
These people are wonderful.
They look like they're on severe medication, but No.
It's not what it seems.
Quick, come over here.
Shh.
I'm not one of them.
See?
This is fake.
Whoa.
Falsies.
All right, folks, break is over.
Our programming will now continue with our American dream slogan number 47.
Buy a lot, spend a lot.
Mindy, what's going on here?
Shh.
One more time.
Buy a lot, spend a lot.
Very good.
Mindy, let's make a run for it.
Let's go.
Now, shall we turn to page  Nonbeliever!
Nonbeliever!
: Nonbeliever!
: Nonbeliever!
: Mindy!
Run, Mindy!
Min, run!
Mork!
Mork, what's wrong?
Mork.
Mindy, oh!
Oh, hold me.
Oh.
Oh, it was really awful.
I was being chased by people with TV antennas in their head.
And they were after me and they were after you.
They were all controlled by a man named Mr. Persuasion.
It was real awful.
It was terrible.
Mork, I told you not to watch TV.
Now, I'm turning this off, and you're going to bed.
Now, there.
There's nothing that can hurt you anymore.
Now, why don't you go upstairs and go to bed?
Kayo.
Okay, good night.
Yeah.
Video.
Nyah-nyah.
We've been looking for you, Mr. Mork.
Whoa.
No, no.
Oh, no.
Mindy!
Mindy.
No.
This isn't real.
It's just a dream, isn't it?
Nothing artificial added.
Oh, no.
No, no.
Get away from me.
No, please.
Come on, join us.
Join us in a world free of fear, anxiety, and midriff bulge.
No.
No way.
Please don't say  No!
Join us.
Join us.
No, no, no.
Join us.
Join us.
Join us.
Join us.
Join us.
No, no.
I'm not joining!
I'm not!
Help!
Help!
I'll help you, Mr. Mork, but I can't do anything until you're one of us.
Oh.
I don't want to.
I want my free will.
You know nothing is free unless you buy the giant size first.
Perhaps you'll reconsider after a little friendly persuasion.
Wouldn't you like to be looked up to by everyone you meet?
I was once on the planet of the dwarfs.
A person of discriminating tastes like you deserves the very best, wouldn't you agree?
Well Yeah, I think so.
I-I'm a neat kind of No, wait a minute.
Mayday, mayday.
Weather alert.
Heavy snow job.
Pull me free.
Oh!
No way.
No sale here, clone prince.
Ha-ha.
Perhaps you'll be more responsive to approach number two.
What?
Oh.
You'll never go to the prom with breath like zoo dirt.
And that hair, it's so dull and lifeless.
I thought it was short and sassy.
Join the in crowd, and you'll smell fresher, even after a busy day.
Well, you're right.
I am kind of an active guy.
Come on.
With our help, you can be really fun to be near.
Yeah, I think that would be kind of Wait a minute.
No way.
Think public television.
PBS, PBS.
There's no place like Cavett.
There's no place like Cavett.
Ah.
Once again, I'm free again.
Mm-mm.
Ha-ha-ha.
Impressive display of control, Mr. Mork, but this one never fails.
Hey, there, big spender.
If you use the right shampoo, I'll do this.
If you use the right aftershave, I'll do this.
: Maintain.
Maintain.
And if you use the right toothpaste, I'll do this.
What happens if I buy everything in the store?
Do you believe in heaven?
Maybe.
Doo-doo-doo Whoa Maintain.
Maintain.
Maintain.
Maintain.
Whoa!
Oh!
Disregard previous maintain.
Time to boogie.
Let's go.
All right.
Oh, come on now.
: Oh!
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Mork.
MISTER  Glad to have you with us.
Welcome aboard.
Ring around the collar.

Hello.
Jean-Claude Killy for Billy Dean pure pork sausage.
: Hey, green lummox, what's new besides "ho, ho, ho"?
Pfft!
Ha-ha-ha!
Hi.
Do you want to speak this fast?
Yes, I'm a graduate of the Rosalind Rude speech-speaking course.
Talk this fast.
Don't be afraid now.
Don't be afraid.
Congratulations.
You're doing fine, Mr. Mork.
You're about to become a full-fledged consumer.
Oh.
Buy more.

Mork, what's wrong?
Oh, Min Whoa!
Wait a minute.
You're not gonna sucker me with that one again.
What are you talking about?
Oh, you must be having a nightmare.
Oh, yeah.
I was, and you were in it, hot hips.
Oh.
When is this horrible thing gonna end?
You're awake now, Mork.
Oh, yeah?
Prove it.
Pinch me.
Yeah, prove it.
Come on Ow!
Well, I couldn't sleep through that noise.
Oh, Mindy, it was real horrible, but first  it was a horrible dream.
People were trying to make me buy things.
Buy!
Buy!
Buy!
Buy!
Buy!
Buy!
Mork, nobody can make you buy things.
Yeah, Mr. Persuasion can.
Eeh!
So ads can because they're so big and strong and they make such nifty promises, and they're so nice to you.
Not if you're a thinking buyer.
Just be selective and use your own judgment.
But I want everyone to like me.
I want to be part of the peppy generation.
People don't like you for what you own.
They like you for what you are.
What are I?
Weird but semi-likable.
Listen, I'll tell you what, Mork.
The next time the urge to buy comes over you, just ask yourself, "Is it really necessary?
Do I really need it"?
All right, let me rehearse.
Need!
Do I really need it, Elizabeth?
No, too strong.
: Do I really need it?
All right, I think I've got it.
I'm ready now.
Okay.
Let's try it out right now.
Let's see if I can find a commercial.
Oh, there's one.
Crunchy potato chips, Okay.
Delicately salted and mouth-watering good.
The crispy taste treat everyone loves.
How can you say halt to Mr. Salt?
Why try?
Okay.
Now, what do you ask yourself?
Do I really need it?
And what is your answer?
Damn straight!
Mork.
All right.
All right.
Do I really need it?
The answer is y-y-y N-n-no!
Good.
Eh.
Ar-ar-ar!
You're off to a good start.
Mindy, where are you going?
You might not need it, but I sure do.
Oh.
I'm glad you like potato chips 'cause you're in for a little surprise.
Look what I got for us.
Mork.
I know what you're going to say, but I really needed these.
For what?
Well, I I filled your bathtub with clam dip.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, great white hoax.
What did you learn this week, Mork?
This week, Your Immenseness, I learned about advertising.
I must warn you, Mork, Orkans are vulnerable to Earth's powers of persuasion.
I know that, sir, especially since we Orkans don't have bathrooms, but you see, advertising is nothing to be afraid of.
Without it, there'd only be Julia Child going: : Today we'll have chicken lips au gratin.
: Besides, advertising tells us about new and wonderful things to replace our old and wonderful things.
Without it, Farrah would just be another Fawcett.
But don't you have an insatiable craving to buy everything?
Well, sir, I must admit I did at first, but then I learned a valuable lesson.
See, I learned that the greatest energy crisis on Earth is a shortage of willpower.
For example, if there's something on television you don't want to watch, you simply just press this but
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Nanu, nanu!
Come in and hold your nose.
Why should I hold my What is that?
A stewed narconium.
I'm fixing Mindy an authentic Orkan dinner.
Narconium?
That sounds like some sort of chemical.
Oh, it is.
You see, you Earthlings load up your food with chemicals, we Orkans have totally eliminated the food.
Well, uh, why would you eat something that smells like that?
It's full of tudium, the gravity vitamin.
Without it, we'd fall right off this planet.
Uh, well, can you let it simmer for a while so we can talk?
All right.
I'll have to come back every 10 minutes and stir or else the molecules will stick together and it'll clot.
Well, what's on your cerebellum?
Uh, you and Mindy.
I've been away for a while and I was wondering if you and she were still getting along real well.
Oh, we're as happy as a couple of bivalve mollusks.
Hmm?
Oh, "clams" to you.
Y-you see, I never really understood your relationship.
After all, you're such different people.
Oh, no, I'm the one that's different.
I mean, Mindy's always been the same.
Uh, uh, I mean you come from such different backgrounds.
Oh.
Oh, I see.
"Can a spunky humanoid from Earth find happiness "with a boy from the wrong side of the galaxy?
Let's see.
Follow me.
Come on".
: Well, yeah, something like that.
Well, how are you and your new mate?
Oh, fine, fine.
Well, uh, it's always tough at first.
I mean, even you and Mindy had problems.
Oh, I scoff at that assertion.
Name one.
How about the time you took her to visit your friend Exidor's lovely mountain retreat?
I thought you were supposed to be such a trailblazer.
Well, I made it from Ork to Earth, but there were no trees.
I wonder when we lost the trail.
I suspect it was right before we fell off the cliff.
Well, I owe you an apology.
Next time you could land on me.
How's your ankle?
Oww!
It's still sprained, but at least now the toes are finally facing forward.
Well, tomorrow morning I'll go looking for our luggage.
I hope it didn't sink.
Are you sure you heard a splash?
I don't know if it was that or the avalanche.
I hope that beaver isn't hurt.
Well, what was a beaver doing out strolling in the middle of the night anyway?
Why wasn't he in his darn dam guarding his sticks and his twigs?
Do you know how yucky it is to step on a beaver's tail?
I didn't know those little suckers could scream.
Well, he won't be sending any more little beaver messages with that tail for a while.
You're not gonna have a nice weekend if you keep up those thoughts.
Mork, I stepped on a beaver, I fell off a cliff and you landed on me, I sprained my ankle, and my luggage is shooting the rapids on the way to Lake Mead, and your scenic, little 3-mile hike was up the face of a cliff.
I knew we were in big trouble when that mountain goat tumbled by.
Boy, I didn't know they could scream, either.
I'm cold and I can't walk anymore, and I'm freezing to death.
But you're right.
You are right.
Why should I be negative?
What else could possibly happen?
Well, I could have lost the key.
Ar, ar, ar, ar!
Just open the door.
You lost the key?
No, he never gave me one.
What?
Mork, we'll freeze to death if we stay out here.
Kick the door in.
But it's Kick the door in.
But on Ork Kick the door in.
But Kick!
Mork.
It wasn't locked.
Oh, dopey, me.
Well, okay.
I admit that's one.
Be honest, now.
You two haven't had any other problems?
Well, one eensy-beensy one.
Mr. Bickley told me that fighting was a great way to keep a relationship exciting.
So to keep Mindy happy, I had this real vicious fight with her.
Aah!
Mork!
You scared me to death!
Well, I'm glad you're home.
Dinner's almost ready.
Why don't you sit down and I'll set it up?
There's a little extra spaghetti sauce on the table if you want some more.
And I'll just get the garlic rolls, and we'll be all set.
You expect me to eat this slop?
What is going on?
You talk about more of the same.
DÃ©jÃ  slop!
Mork!
What are you doing?
I'm putting your buns in orbit, that's what I'm doing!
What is wrong with you?
!
Mindy, I'm tired of eating food that even the airlines would turn down!
I've seen cockroaches go, "No way"!
I thought you liked my cooking.
You had a thought?
Ar, ar, ar, ar!
I didn't think there was anything under that Barbie doll hairdo of yours.
Whoa, look.
Echo!
Echo!
Echo!
Mork.
Why don't you just shave it off and get yourself a mohawk?
That way it'll draw attention away from your nose.
My nose, what's wrong with my nose?
Are you kidding, it's Shiksa City.
And your feet.
Whoa!
Where do you get your shoes, Barnum and Bailey?
And what's that wonderful fragrance?
Oh, no!
Old Spice!
Ship ahoy, ship ahoy Oh, maybe it's Indian leather.
: We like to make a fragrance from the cow, dead for four days, lying in the sun.
: Mork.
: Mindy, don't whimper.
It makes you look like a Pekingese with asthma.
And it makes your eyes look even closer together.
Okay, it's your turn.
: Oh, Mork!
I just can't believe Boy, this is gonna be great.
Mindy, Mindy, Mind, Min, Min.
That was the best fight I've ever seen.
Was it good for you too?
Come on, now, it's time to kiss and make up.
Kiss and make up?
I wouldn't kiss you if you were the only alien on Earth!
I think I am.
There's your proof!
Oh.
So you don't like my cooking, huh?
We Well, if you don't like it, why don't you get off your face and cook something for yourself!
You don't know this.
It's not that easy to be living with a monster from outer space.
I mean, most guys just leave the cap off the toothpaste, right?
You eat it!
Okay, fight's over.
Kinzex.
Fight's over, my foot.
So you don't like my hairstyle, huh?
Well, Mr. Taste, where'd you get these rags?
Ow!
A fire sale at Disney World?
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean it.
Oh, and by the way, since we're into honesty, I'd like to inform you that your normal voice sounds like Truman Capote on helium.
: Hello, I'm Mork from Ork.
Nanu, nanu.
But you can just call me Space Turkey.
Ar, ar, ar, ar, ar, ar!
Ow!
Ow!
See, I'm I'm cutting myself.
Look, there's blood.
There will be.
Blood, blood.
Bleed.
Bleed.
Mork, that's such a shame.
We'll have to have that taken care of.
I'll call the veterinarian.
Mindy, I think I've made a mistake.
You made the mistake?
Yeah.
I made the mistake.
I should have listened to my father.
I never should have let you move in here in the first place.
If he told me once, he told me a million times.
"Mindy, stick to your own species".
Well, Mind, I guess I'll just go up to bed Go up to bed, my foot.
There is an egg leaving in 10 minutes.
Be in it.
Mindy?
My lips aren't that long.
I mean, I don't want you to think the whole year was that bad.
I did try and help Mindy too.
I'm sure you did.
But you gotta admit, for a moment, you were proud of me, weren't you, Pops?
Mork, believe it or not, I am proud of you.
I know how happy you've made Mindy.
: Aw.
Gee, thanks, Pops.
Boy, I guess I should have knocked first.
Oh, Min, Pops and I were just talking over old times.
Yes, I've missed a lot in this last year.
Well, you also gained a lot too.
And speaking of that, where's your new bride?
Oh, uh, uh, she She's back at the house.
Well, why don't you call her up and invite her over for dinner?
Oh, Min.
Min, we only have enough for two, unless you brought along some Narconium Helper.
Or we could go out?
Uh, I-I-I don't think I can call her.
Oh, don't worry.
I remember the number.
Things aren't working out too well with Cathy and me.
What happened?
Did you two have a fight?
Oh, no, no, no.
It's just that I'm afraid we're not right for each other.
This marriage may have been a mistake.
But, Dad, you've only been married a few months.
I know, but it's just not working out.
Well, what happened?
She found out you were bald?
Uh, no, I told her that before we were married.
Well, what happened?
You two seemed so happy.
I thought I was happy, but I wasn't.
Oh.
I know what that's like.
I thought I was once a polar bear, but I wasn't.
Maybe I'm a butterfly.
I don't know.
Before we were married, we had so much in common.
Like being single.
Like love of music and hating carrots.
It's the real reason I came over here.
You two are really different but your relationship works fine.
Maybe I'm out of line here, Dad, but I've watched you two for the last couple of weeks, and I've never seen two happier people.
Yeah, like Cinderella and Prince Charming, Romeo and Juliet, Sodom and Gomorrah.
: I really wish that were true.
But, it's just I'm finding out all these things about her.
Well, like what?
So far, you haven't been too specific.
Uh, well, um, she's, um, um, completely unpredictable.
I mean, I-I never know what she's gonna say or do from one moment to the next.
Well, a person can learn to live with that, you know.
To whom are you referring?
To you.
Remember when your emotions came out for the first time?
Yeah.
Well, they've been bottled up for billions of bleens, of course they'll act like a starving fish at a worm roast.
Yes, and I'll never forget when you came into the music store the morning after.
: Well, excu-u-se me!
: Why don't you ever sell any of this stuff?
!
My!
What's wrong?
Oh, Mindy, that wasn't me.
That was anger.
Oh, well, what happened to your other emotions?
Well, I think they're sleeping it off in my mind.
Oh, it's been a hard day's night, I can't tell you.
I'd lock 'em all up behind there except anger's standing guard.
: Yeah, and I'm a big boy too.
And don't mess with me!
Aww, get off!
: It's okay now.
See?
Where have you been?
Don't ask.
I've done things that would embarrass Idi Amin.
Like what?
Well, we started off by going to the waterfront.
Wait a minute, there's no waterfront in Colorado.
Who says we stayed in Colorado?
Here are some shells.
We started off by going to this really cheap dive called the Ballpark.
Fear didn't want to go in, but Disgust called him a sissy.
And Excitement was so titillated by that, he went to the bar and ordered 10 beers, one for each finger.
Guilt felt so bad about that, he yanked us into the alley.
Whimsy said it must be named Mohammad.
Shut up!
Let me finish the story!
Okay.
Suddenly, we were surrounded by a vicious motorcycle gang.
There were 12 of us against 42 of them.
Anger still spitting leather.
Mork, whatever happened to the positive emotions, like love?
Oh, yes.
I don't know what I said to that girl on the street corner.
All I remember is that she sold her car and gave all the money to me.
Well, at least you seem all right now.
Yeah, but that's just for the moment.
Who knows when they'll come out again?
At anytime Yeah!
Shh.
See?
Oh.
I can't go to your birthday party, Mindy.
It'll ruin the birthday for you.
Oh, Mork, the only thing that would ruin my birthday is if you're not there.
Yeah, you're right.
I'm a heck of a guy.
What's that?
Oh, Grandma made me this for my birthday.
Isn't it nice?
Yeah, I knitted it myself.
It took me five weeks.
Five weeks?
Ha!
What did you use for knitting needles, crowbars?
Oh, I think my emotions are waking up again.
I noticed.
Unfortunately, they're coming out at the wrong times, aren't they?
Yeah, I think they're trying to get out and teach me a lesson and show me who's boss.
Ha-ha!
Ah-ha!
Not now!
It's okay.
See?
Now, Dad, has Cathy ever insulted your relatives or destroyed your place of business?
No.
You know, not only have I gotten used to Mork's craziness, I sometimes even look forward to the next disaster.
Oh, thanks, Mind.
Dad, what was it about Cathy that you really liked when you first met her?
Well, she was so different from anyone I'd ever met, so fresh, and so full of surprises.
So unpredictable.
Yeah, I guess so.
That's one down.
What's bothering you about her now?
Well, this may sound picky, but she has some really weird friends.
I mean, she has this girlfriend who bakes these terrible oatmeal raisin cookies, and she must bring a dozen of them to the house every week.
This man is cooking narconium in my living room and you think that's strange?
Try comparing oatmeal raisin cookies to Exidor.
Oh, come on, Mind, there's no comparison.
Exidor's only half-baked.
How did you meet him, anyway?
Well, it was when I ran away from home.
I was I was lonely.
I needed someone to talk to.
A good, solid, down-to-earth person.
This is my philosophy for friends of Venus.
I want you to study it and memorize it so that you can go out with me and convert the nonbeliever.
I'll study hard and let you know when I'm ready.
Oop!
I'm ready.
Oh, no.
On your feet.
Uh, let's pretend that, uh, I am a nonbeliever, and you try and convert me.
Hey, you, nonbeliever.
Good start.
But we need more power in your voice and more conviction.
Oh, I see.
: Friend I have need of your attention.
Friend, do you realize that Venusians are coming down to Earth?
But they're not coming here on Veterans Day, not on April Fools' Day, but on Labor Day.
Baby, ba-a-be.
Can you hear me, friend?
I hear ya.
Are you ready?
Now, can I get a nanu, nanu?
Nanu, nanu!
Thank you, friend.
Do you realize, friend, what they're coming here to do?
Because they've come down here to blow the Earth to smithereens!
But it's not that bad, friend, because they're sending a ship down here to save 1000 of us.
And they're making a list and they're checking it twice.
Now, friend, now, you can either stay down here in your disco, drug-infested inferno or come up to Venus and have your very own Venusian condo-minimum with hot and cold running champagne and underwater dancing.
You must apply now!
Mork!
Mork!
That was beautiful!
Why can't you be more like him?
But there's something missing.
What we need is more of your experiences with the Venusians here on Earth.
I didn't meet them on Earth.
I met them on Venus.
You've been there?
Oh, yes.
I've been to all the planets in your solar system.
Mars?
Mercury?
Pluto?
Oh, don't ever go to Pluto.
It's a Mickey Mouse planet.
I guess I can get used to Cathy's friends, especially when I see what you've had to put up with.
: Really.
To tell you the truth, Dad, the problems that you're talking about seem pretty small.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I can understand little things getting on your nerves, but imagine what life would be like without Cathy.
There was a time when Mindy and I thought we'd never see each other again.
We were captured by Necrotons, put in this big cage where we were waiting to have our brains sucked out.
Come on, Min, cheer up.
Hey, I'll give you a little ride.
She was only a girl In a gilded cage Mork.
Sorry, Mind.
Stop trying to cheer me up.
Yeah, I know.
It's kind of hard to frolic in the face of doom.
You know, I've been thinking about all the things that have happened to me since I've met you.
But one thing for sure, I never thought I'd end up sitting in a birdcage waiting for my brains to be sucked out by Necrotons.
Well, look on the bright side.
You still have your health.
Mork, you know, you You didn't have to come back and risk your life to save me, but you did.
Thanks.
Yeah, but I kind of botched up.
'Cause if I'd done the right thing, you'd be safe in your own home when they destroyed the Earth.
I guess we've had a full life.
I only wish I'd gotten to meet Anson Williams.
Mork, there's something that I've been wanting to tell you for a long time, but I just couldn't.
Oh, what is it, Mind?
Well, one time when you weren't home, I I put on your spacesuit.
The helmet too?
Boots and all.
Are you mad?
No.
I have a confession to make to you too.
Well, one time when you weren't home, I I held your blow dryer and jumped up and down on your bed.
Are you mad?
No.
I guess we've done it all.
What Mindy and I've discovered, it's the love between people, not their differences, that count.
Well, I definitely love her.
That's not the problem.
It's just all the little things that are bothering me now that we're living together.
Well, you lived with me for quite a while, and I had a few minor idiosyncrasies.
Like the time I used your entire stamp collection on my Valentine's Day cards.
The point is, when you love somebody, you get used to things like that.
Dad, listen to yourself.
Yeah, you're just like the guys on Feeva Scalactra.
I mean, the day after the wedding, they get real nervous and jittery and they won't stay with their wives.
Well, that sounds just like me.
Why do they feel that way?
Probably 'cause the third day after the wedding is known as.
"Kill Your Husband Day".
I guess that saves on anniversary gifts.
Maybe you guys are right.
I've been blowing things out of proportion.
Yeah, you're making a supernova out of a meteor shower.
Dad, didn't these kinds of things ever happen with Mom too?
Yes.
I guess I'm a little out of practice at marriage.
Just talking to you makes me feel better.
Well, good.
Now, I think you should go find Cathy right now.
Well, I feel I should apologize to her for the things I've been thinking.
Apologies, that's no problem.
Mindy taught me all about those.
All right, here, you be Cathy, and I'll be you.
Cathy, darling, I I feel there's something I have to tell you.
Darling, I I feel like I've been such an idiot.
I-I mean, I've been the biggest, lamest Well, chowder head there is because Uh, Mork, I think I can handle the apology myself.
Thanks.
I'm just trying to make you happy, Pops.
I'm trying to help.
You did.
And I want to thank you both.
: Mm.
Cathy and I are just gonna be fine.
Oh, good.
And in a few years, I hope we'll have the kind of memories you two have.
Oh, you will.
Without the Necrotons.
: Bye, Dad.
Maybe I should give him some narconium to take home to Cathy.
Ah, here we go.
: Oh.
I should have made the French fried chicken lips.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
Mork calling Orson.
Come in, Orson.
I'm here, Mork, waiting for your report.
Well, sir, this week I learned about solving problems.
You were playing detective?
Wrong, your gravity!
Got you there!
We're talking about affection, not detection.
You see, it seems that Earthlings have the need to talk about their problems with people that they love.
Why do they choose to burden their friends?
Well, in the words of honorable Charlie Chan, : "A man who, ah, bottle up problems liable to pop cork".
Mork.
Sir.
Is this typical human behavior, feeling free to discuss their personal hang-ups with each other?
All I know, sir, is if Romeo and Juliet had talked more, their story might have had a happier ending.
But then, who would've ever heard of them?
Well.
Sorry.
What about that old Earth saying that talk is cheap?
Well, sir, I don't know if that's true, but when it comes to helping others, talk is priceless.
Until next week, sir, Nanus is good news.
Nanu.
