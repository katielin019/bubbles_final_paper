{START OF EPISODE 1}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all Well, Mary, what do you think?
Here it is.
Oh, wow!
Hey, it really is charming, isn't it?
Why are we showing her the apartment?
'Cause she's gonna be living here.
Won't that be fun?
Having Aunt Mary living right upstairs from us.
She's not my aunt.
Well, that's right, Bess.
I'm not really your aunt.
But your mother and I have known each other for a long time, and sometimes Bess is right, Mary.
We try to be very truthful in our family.
- You're not her aunt.
- That's right, Bess.
I'm not your aunt.
Phyllis, I just love it.
It's charming.
I thought this was gonna be Aunt Rhoda's apartment.
Who's Aunt Rhoda?
Oh, that dumb, awful girl who lives upstairs that Bess likes.
She's not your aunt, Bess.
That dumb Rhoda thinks this is going to be her apartment, so I signed a year's lease for you.
You signed a lease before I even saw the place?
Wait till you see the view.
It's absolutely incredible, isn't it?
- Aunt Rhoda?
- Oh, that dumb, awful girl.
Don't pay any attention to her.
I'm gonna go get the owner.
- Come on, Bess.
- Aunt Rhoda's really a lot of fun.
- Mom hates her.
- Oh?
Uh, you want Oh.
- Give me a hand, will you?
- Sure.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
- So you're, uh, Rhoda?
- Morgenstern.
- And I'm Mary Richards.
- Oh, hello.
Get out of my apartment.
Now, look, Rhoda, I don't know all the details, but Phyllis will be back, and then we can talk about it.
I don't talk to her.
And besides, there's no discussion here.
This is my apartment.
Would I be out in the snow washing the windows of your apartment?
No.
I did that for my apartment.
Would I spend an entire month's salary on brand-new carpeting for you?
I don't know you.
I never saw you before.
That's for me, I did it.
You spent a whole month's salary?
The owner's out of town for a few days, but his wife said - What'd you let her in for?
- Phyllis, Phyllis.
I can't take this apartment.
She spent a whole month's salary on the new carpeting.
Oh, that's old carpeting.
It comes with the apartment.
- You lied to me?
- You betcha.
I lied.
Okay, girls, you want me to tell you the truth?
I'm gonna tell you the truth.
- This is gonna be my apartment!
- All right, Rhoda.
I'm gonna tell you why Mary needs this apartment more than you do, - why she's moved here to Minneapolis.
- No.
No, no.
No!
Tell me.
A beautiful romance just blew up in her face.
It did not blow up.
I made the decision.
I was going with someone for a couple of years, and Now I'm telling her.
For two years, through his internship and then his residency at the hospital, Bill let her almost support him.
Uh, Phyllis, how 'bout if I asked you very nicely to stop this?
For two years, he promised her that the minute he started his practice, they would be married.
- Phyllis, would you please stop this?
- After two long years Tell her what he said, Mary.
Go ahead.
After two long years, he said "Why rush into things"?
That's why she's here, to start a new life for herself.
That's why she needs this apartment.
Compared to my life, that's a Walt Disney movie.
Now, if you girls will kindly clear out, I'm gonna get back to washing my windows.
All right, Mary.
You can stay downstairs with us tonight.
There's an extra bed in Bess's room.
I've got a couple of job interviews to go on, so I'll meet you later.
- We'll settle this tomorrow, Rhoda.
- It's already settled, Phyllis.
You, out.
You think I'm some kind of a pushover, don't you?
Yeah.
Well, then you're in for a little surprise.
'Cause if you push me, then I just might have to push back.
Hard.
Come on.
You can't carry that off.
I know.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
I'm supposed to see a, um, Mr., uh I beg your pardon.
I wonder if you could tell me - Excuse me.
- Hello.
Hello!
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'm supposed to see a Mr. Grant about a secretarial job.
It's been filled.
Since this young lady came to see Mr. Grant, why don't you let Mr. Grant handle it?
- Right this way, miss.
- It's been filled.
Uh, do you have any idea when Mr. Grant will be back?
I'm Mr. Grant.
You're back!
Look, miss, I was just about to have a drink, and I wouldn't mind some company.
- Want one?
- Uh, no, thank you.
I said I wouldn't mind some company.
All right.
I'll have a Brandy Alexander.
How 'bout some coffee?
That'll be fine.
Uh, has the job been filled?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
- But there is another job.
- Oh?
- I figured I'd hire a man for it.
- Oh.
But we can talk about it.
Well, good.
Hey, you live in my favorite neighborhood.
Oh, really?
I just moved in.
Is it that nice?
Nice?
Some of the best saloons in town are over there.
- How old are you?
- Thirty.
No hedging?
No "how old do I look"?
Why hedge?
How old do I look?
- Thirty.
- Oh.
What religion are you?
Uh, Mr. Grant, I don't quite know how to say this, but you're not allowed to ask that when someone's applying for a job.
- It's against the law.
- Wanna call a cop?
- No.
- Good.
Would you think I was violating your civil rights if I asked if you're married?
Presbyterian.
Well, l-I decided I'd answer your religion question.
- Divorced?
- No.
- Never married?
- No.
- Why?
- Why?
- You type?
- Mr. Grant, there's no simple answer to that question.
Yes, there is.
How 'bout, "No, I can't type" or "Yes, I can".
There's no simple answer to why a person isn't married.
- How many reasons can there be?
- Sixty-five.
- Words per minute.
My typing question.
- Yes.
Look, miss, would you try answering the questions as I ask 'em?
Yes, I will, but it does seem that you've been asking a lot of very personal questions that don't have a thing to do with my qualifications for this job.
You know what?
You've got spunk.
- Well, yes.
- I hate spunk!
Tell you what I'll try you out for a couple of weeks, see if it works out.
- Oh!
- If I don't like you, I'll fire you.
- Right, right.
- You don't like me, I'll fire you!
That certainly seems fair.
- What's the job?
- The job is that of associate producer.
- Associate - Something wrong?
No, no, no, I like it.
Associate producer.
The job pays ten dollars less a week than a secretarial job.
That'll be fine.
If you can, uh, get by on 15 less a week, we'll make you producer.
No, no.
I think all I can afford is associate producer.
You can start tomorrow.
Oh, well, that's just wonderful!
So I'll see you tomorrow!
Associate producer!
- You're doing a wonderful job, Bess.
- Thanks, Mom.
Phyllis, are you in there?
- Just a sec.
- My key doesn't work.
I had the lock changed to keep dumb, awful Rhoda out.
Hey, listen.
I've got the greatest news.
I got a job!
I went on this interview for a regular secretary job, and what, uh Wh- What's the matter?
You haven't even noticed that your furniture arrived.
Oh, great!
Hey, how 'bout that?
Hi, Bess!
Listen, I didn't tell you about the job.
I got there a little bit late.
I was kind of nervous.
Something's still the matter.
Bess arranged it for you.
Oh.
Bess, it looks just great.
I really like it.
Really.
Well, the job is at WJ M-TV in the newsroom.
Now, it's not quite as important as the title sounds, but Didn't I thank Bess enough?
It's just that I have some rather shattering news for you.
- Shattering news?
- But it can wait.
- Shattering news?
- Tell me about your new job.
I'm only an associate producer.
What's the shattering news?
Well, I got a long-distance call today.
I was on the phone for 45 minutes, and guess what.
Your boyfriend's coming to see you.
That was Mother's news, Bess.
Bill's coming?
I realize you wanted to tell her, too, but that was Mother's news.
Bill is coming?
Phyllis!
Yes, Bill's coming.
He'll be here tomorrow night.
We'll leave you alone now.
I know exactly how you feel.
- I don't know how I feel.
- Well, I do.
Come on, Bess.
I really didn't mind arranging the furniture.
Mother said it was the least we could do after what you've been through.
Uh, Bess, did Mother tell you exactly what I've been through?
Everything.
All right, lady.
There you go.
What the What are you doing with your furniture in my apartment?
Rhoda, this is my apartment.
So this is your little trick, changing the lock, huh?
What's going on?
You told me you lived here.
Who is he?
A locksmith.
What do you think?
Here.
- Thank you very much.
- I'm not going along with this.
If this is her place, I just helped you break in.
That's what you just did.
Look, even if you did, it's already done.
So what can you do?
- Let me see your driver's license.
- What?
If anything happens here, I wanna know who you are.
I'm not gonna show you my driver's license.
In that case, I'm gonna memorize your face.
Small mole, left cheek.
Uh, now that you see that I've moved in, would you leave?
Where do you come off looking that good in the morning?
Look, Rhoda, I'm starting a new job today, so Where'd you get that nightie from, Tricia Nixon?
So if you don't mind I hear your doctor-boyfriend's making a little house call tonight.
Bess told me.
You know, Mary, I hope everything works out for you.
I really do.
Well, thanks.
Because if it does, that means you'll move out of here, and this'll be mine.
Rhoda!
I left New York City because I couldn't find an apartment.
I'm not gonna leave Minneapolis for the same reason.
- You know what?
- What?
In spite of everything, you're hard to dislike.
I know what you mean.
I'm having a hard time hating you too.
We'll both have to work on it.
Somebody get Ted Baxter in here.
He's probably in makeup.
- I'll do it, Mr. Grant.
- He'll do it.
- When I say "somebody," I mean him.
- Mr. Grant.
Uh, I wondered, do you think you could find something for me to do?
- I'd like to be busier.
- I'm too busy to keep you busy.
Why did he hire me?
Why?
Maybe he was bombed.
No, I mean it.
Hiya, fellas.
Here he is, the Marcello Mastroianni of Minneapolis newscasters.
Why, thanks, Murr.
It's not a compliment.
He has trouble speaking English too.
Hi.
You haven't met me.
I'm Ted Baxter, the anchorman.
I know.
And I'm Mary Richards.
I'm the new, uh Wonderful!
I've been telling Lou we needed a new one.
Uh, welcome to my 6:00 news team.
- Thank you.
- Baxter, will you knock it off?
Come on, let's get to the studio.
- Newsroom.
Just a moment, please.
- Baxter!
Mr. Grant, it's Mrs. Grant.
She's calling from the airport.
Oh, yeah, she's going to her sister's for a month.
Tell her I'll speak to her when she gets back.
Murray, give me that list of words that Baxter mispronounced on last night's show.
Check the top one, Lou.
The top one.
"Chicago"?
Come on, fellas!
And take that makeup bib off!
Last night he wore it halfway through the show.
Newsroom.
Miss Bill?
Well, hi!
When did you get into town?
Uh, yeah, that's right.
I'm working here in the newsroom.
Associate producer.
Can you believe that?
Oh, yeah, they're keeping me really busy.
No, no, I'm not too busy to talk.
Well, how long will you be in town?
Sure.
Drop over tonight.
It'll be good seeing you too.
Bye, Bill.
You've changed the room around.
Personally, I didn't think there was a thing wrong with the way Bess arranged it.
Well, I just, you know, switched a couple of things.
Well, it's your apartment, until you're married anyway.
Well, look, Phyllis, just because Bill is coming tonight, it doesn't mean we're getting married.
- I want to see you married, Mary.
- Well, me too.
Because I'm married.
And I know how beautiful it can be if you look at it realistically.
I mean, realistically.
Face the fact that it means a certain amount of sacrificing, of unselfishness, denying your own ego, sublimating, accommodating, surrendering.
- Phyllis.
- Say it.
You're hurting my hand.
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- Try and remember what I told you.
- I will.
Believe me, I know about marriage.
Coward.
Hi!
Hi.
Hi.
Nice place.
Uh, well, yeah, it's-it's beginning to shape up, you know.
A lot of the furniture still hasn't arrived, and, of course, uh, curtains at the window, you know, will help.
And, uh And I really don't know why you're here, Mr. Grant.
Well, I was in the neighborhood visiting one of my favorite spas.
My wife left today.
She's gonna be away for a whole month.
Now I know why you're here.
Oh, yes, Miss Associate Producer, he said he'd find something for you to do.
Certainly didn't get the job because of your personality.
You know, you got a great caboose.
There it is.
You got the job because of your great caboose.
But not as great as my wife's.
She's got the greatest caboose ever.
She left today.
She's gonna be away for a whole month, and I miss her already.
I miss her so much, I am going to write her a letter and tell her.
- Good.
- Where's your typewriter?
Uh, well, I'll tell you, Mr. Grant, I just moved in, and I'm not really sure where everything is.
Ah, there's the little portable devil!
You know, there's a whole slew of typewriters down at the office.
Oh, yeah.
Wouldn't you be more comfortable there?
Oh, no.
My dearest - How are ya?
- I'm fine.
How are you?
I'm fine.
- No, I'm not.
- That's my boss down at the newsroom.
- Is there a big news story here?
- Oh, no.
He's, uh, writing to his wife.
I miss you more than Where did you ever get roses in winter?
Roses in winter.
That's beautiful.
Oh, um, you, uh - you don't want to read that, Mary.
- Oh?
Why?
Did you have a weak moment and get mushy?
No, no, it's just that Here, give me the Too late.
It's already out.
"Get well soon, Uncle Buddy.
Love, Gloria and Milton".
I got 'em from a patient down at the hospital.
- Oh?
- It's not as if I stole them.
I had to promise Uncle Buddy a free nose job.
Hey, I don't know about you, but I don't like being in separate towns.
Hey, I don't know about you, but Say, you know, it's, um it's a little difficult to talk with, uh Is it possible to out?
Uh all my love, Lou.
All my love, Lou.
Hey!
I am finished.
I think I'll go tie one on.
That's kind of a weird boss you've got there.
Oh, I don't know.
I think that's kind of sweet.
You know, a man who misses his wife that much.
You just couldn't wait, could you?
- Couldn't wait for what?
- To bring up marriage.
I waited two years, Bill.
That's not exactly "couldn't wait".
Th-That's waiting.
That's really waiting.
Okay, okay.
You're right, I'm wrong.
I know there's no need to talk about it anymore.
That's not why I'm here.
Oh?
Why are you here?
Well, I haven't seen you in a month or so, and, uh, l You didn't think the only reason I was here was to No, no.
I'm here because l I love you.
- How come I never noticed that before?
- That I love you?
That you don't say that very well.
You Something kind of catches in there, and it just it doesn't come out too well.
Well, uh, maybe you can give me some lessons then.
Now, you see, that you say very well.
Hey, come on, Mary.
We got the whole night ahead of us.
We're getting all hung up on words.
Why don't you get us out of this?
You say everything so well.
No, I don't.
I say a lousy good-bye.
Hi.
You got a stamp?
I'll see.
Um, uh, Mary?
Did you just say good-bye?
- Uh-huh.
- That's what I thought you said.
Uh, yeah, well, I'll s I'll see you.
Take Take care of yourself.
I think I just did.
Bye!
This is a Christmas seal.
Is, uh, is that a stamp?
Yes, it is.
Thank you.
That guyyou didn't lose much.
But he sure did.
He missed out on the best wife.
Boy, it's funny how you can see things differently in just a couple of weeks.
You know, I could have married him.
Can you imagine what what that life would have been like?
Boy, every time I'd get a basket of flowers, I'd wonder if he stole them from Uncle Buddy's sickbed.
Listen, if I were you, I'd find out what Uncle Buddy was sick with.
You know, I'm really lucky.
I am so lucky.
You feel good now, huh?
Yeah.
No, I feel rotten.
But lucky.
Look, about the job, I'll find plenty for you to do tomorrow at the station.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Grant.
- If I show up.
- Hi!
- Hi.
If that's Bill, you didn't lose much.
Isn't that funny?
That's what everyone says.
- It didn't work out, huh?
- Did Bess tell you?
No, I figured it out for myself.
I've got this tremendous sensitivity, and you've got this heating duct that goes all the way up to my apartment.
Oh.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all You all know how I hate long meetings.
So I figured out a way to cut down on the give and take.
I'll give, you take.
I'm not saying there's cause for alarm, but I would like to get a little constructive hysteria going.
- There's a drop in the ratings again.
- How far?
- Go ahead, Mary.
Read 'em.
- Let's see.
6:00 news.
Last week we were a 1.1.
Then we plummeted down to a 1.0.
What does that mean?
An entire family of midgets tuned us out?
Look, a drop in the ratings may not seem like a big deal to you, but if it continues this way, I could lose my job.
Nobody went, "Aww"!
Oh, Mr. Grant.
- We're losing the young audience.
- Gee, I don't know why.
I like the show.
I watched it even before I came to work here.
You're not young anymore.
- l-I'm not?
- Check the ratings book.
It's broken down into age groups.
Young is 18 to 29.
- You don't make it anymore.
- l-I don't?
Hi, gang.
I heard there was a big powwow going on here.
- It's our ratings, Ted.
- Oh, are they up?
Does this look like a celebration?
Now, does anybody have any suggestions about improving the show?
Improving the show.
Well, we could make it longer.
No, Ted, you've missed the point.
If it's not doing too hot now, that would make it not doing too hot stretched out.
Lou, why don't we all write out on slips of paper what we feel the main drawback of the show is?
- Then have them read anonymously.
- Why anonymously?
So Ted's feelings won't be hurt.
- Ted Baxter?
- Yo.
- Got some mail for you.
Fan mail.
- Fan mail for a newscaster?
That crazy, kooky American public.
Fan mail.
Only in America.
- Here you go.
- That's it?
Yes, sir.
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am?
Ma'am?
Oh, you mean me?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am?
This kid No, he wasn't even a kid.
He must have been 21 or 22 years old.
He comes over to me and he calls me "ma'am".
Ma'am!
- Your first time?
- Yeah.
Not only that, I found out that our ratings service has declared me officially over the hill.
That's nothing.
When I turned 21 and still wasn't married, my mother officially declared me an old maid.
I think she had it notarized.
Wait a minute, Rhoda.
Let's stop this.
If there's one thing that's worse than being single, it's sitting around talking about being single.
So let's change the subject to something a little more pleasant.
Like pollution?
This is important, Mar.
There are many single women who've lived perfectly fulfilled lives.
Who?
I'm getting a pencil, paper and make a list.
No, Rhoda, I am not about to sit around and make lists of single women.
We're not.
We're gonna make lists of single men to go out with.
We go out all the time.
Yeah, but when was the last time you went out with someone really terrific?
- Well - Last time for me was when my father took me to a ball game.
Come in.
- Hi, Mary!
- Hi.
I just came up to bring back the ice cubes I borrowed.
I didn't need them after all.
This is a bag of water, Phyllis.
Oh!
I stopped downstairs to talk to Mildred for a few minutes.
- Want me to refreeze them for you?
- This is fine, thank you.
What's that, a word-game thing?
It's nothing, really.
We can do it later.
We're trying to think of men to go out with.
That was Rhoda Morgenstern with the 8:00 news.
Listen, if you really want to go out with someone fantastic, look in your own backyard Ted Baxter.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
I might have been kind of bowled over by his good looks in the beginning, but he's good-looking in that good-looking way.
He always looks to me like he's posing for a postage stamp.
First impressions can really be so wrong.
Like Lars and me.
Did I ever tell you when I first met him?
No, I don't think so.
When I first met him This sounds ridiculous.
I know you're gonna think I'm insane.
When I first met Lars, I used to think he was boring.
Isn't that the funniest thing you ever heard?
Really, I'm serious.
Of course, now we just couldn't be happier.
We've been married 10 Let's think.
What man in your life it could have been a long time ago or someone you just met do you wish you knew better?
- There was this professional dancer.
- Not you, Phyllis.
Mary, come on.
There must have been somebody.
- Anyone recently?
- No.
- Think back, then.
- No.
Yes, there was.
Remember, Mary?
Howard Arnell.
Howard Arnell!
Phyllis, how did you even come up with that name?
Lars ran into him a while ago.
He's still single, still asks about you.
- He was wild about Mary.
- Then that settles it.
Now all we need is someone for me.
What do you mean, that settles it?
I have an idea for someone, but, nah, it's too crazy.
- Then again, maybe it isn't.
- Remember how wild he was about you?
Listen, Rhoda, nothing is settled.
Phyllis, it was four years ago.
- I hardly remember him.
- He was wild about her.
Listen, Mary, if you call yours, I'll call mine.
And my whole thing is crazy.
All right.
What's yours?
Mine is this guy I ran over.
He had a cleft chin.
Oh, he was adorable.
This guy you ran over?
Yeah, it was a couple of days ago.
But he wasn't hurt.
His arm was just a little grazed.
Although his briefcase was totaled.
We got to talking and exchanged phone numbers ah, here it is.
"Armond Lynton".
So what do you think?
You don't know this man outside of hitting him with your car?
No, and I know you're gonna think I'm kidding, but you can really get close to someone fast when you hit him with a car.
You can't just get to know someone over coffee, can you?
You're not gonna believe this, Phyllis, but when I first hit him, I thought he was boring.
So, Mary, what do you think?
We're not doing a thing tomorrow night.
Let's call Howard and Armond.
What do I think?
You want to call up a man you hit with your car, and I'm supposed to call up someone I hardly remember?
There's not much to think about.
I'm not gonna do it.
Oh, good.
Bess is having her first pajama party tomorrow night.
You can help.
We're having 19 of her little friends over.
You can even come early and help blow up the air mattresses.
Actually, I didn't say that I was definitely not gonna call Howard.
But, you know, if I don't, then I'd be glad to come and help you blow up the 18 air mattresses.
Nineteen.
And I won't be there.
My mother's going to take care of the kids.
Lars and I, we're going to spend the night in a hotel.
Right here.
Howard Arnell.
Come on.
We both said we have nothing to do tomorrow night.
- Oh, Rhoda!
- Nineteen little friends.
Ohh!
Nineteen air mattresses.
All right.
- We'll make it for drinks, not dinner.
- Good.
It'll be easier that way.
What'll I tell him?
8:30?
Perfect.
Uh, hello, Howard.
You'll never guess who this is.
Well, that's uncanny.
I mean, it's been four years.
Is that right?
Four years, three months and two weeks.
Yeah, you're right, Howard.
There is a lot to talk about.
Actually, that's why I'm calling.
I'm gonna have a little gathering at my house tomorrow night about 8:30.
I wondered if you could come.
Oh, good.
The address is Right.
So, uh, I'll see you then.
What?
Howard, it's sweet of you to offer, but no, I have enough chairs.
Yeah.
No, glasses aren't any problem either.
Well, uh, listen, Howard.
I've gotta get off the phone.
I have something in the stove, so, uh What?
Howard, that's sweet of you to offer.
At your place?
No, really, it's no problem.
Howard, listen, I've got to go.
My bathwater is running over.
So, uh Well, thank you, Howard.
Coming!
In just a minute!
Howard, listen, I really I must go.
So I'll see you Friday tomorrow night.
Right.
Good-bye.
Oh.
Ohh!
I remember.
I remember.
I remember why I broke off with Howard.
Go on.
Too much.
Too much loving, too much understanding, too much giving.
Too much!
It's impossible to hold a normal conversation with him.
Maybe I can call him back and tell him I'm sick.
If it weren't for the fact that I have the phone in my hand and am already dialing Armond's number, I'd say, of course, sure.
But under the circumstances, call it off?
Call off a cleft chin?
Hello, Armond?
Armond, this is Rhoda Morgenstern.
You remember me.
We met when you were under my car.
Oh, yes, right.
That's me.
I thought I'd give you a buzz and see how you and your arm are getting along.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.
Listen, Armond, while I have you on the phone, tomorrow night a friend of mine is having some people over.
I wondered if you cared to drop by just so I can take a look at the patient.
Oh, great!
Oh, I'm so glad.
It's 119 North Wetherley.
Right.
What?
Oh, of course.
Lovely.
Yes, see you then, Armond.
Bye.
Am I smiling, Mary?
- Yeah.
- Was I smiling when I talked to him?
- Sure.
- Good.
'Cause if I'm smiling now, that means I can smile anytime.
I can even smile tomorrow night when you and I have our little fivesome.
- Our little fivesome?
- That's right.
Armond is bringing his wife.
Ohh.
Mary, are you sure this looks okay?
- I feel so fat.
- Yeah, it looks fine.
You think this munchy stuff is enough?
Everybody will have eaten dinner.
That's just right.
How can you gorge yourself like that and stay so skinny?
- I'm going crazy with hunger.
- Well, eat something.
I can't.
I gotta lose ten pounds by 8:30.
This dress is all wrong, Mar.
I wonder if I should have worn my pantsuit.
Maybe I should call my date, see what his wife's wearing.
You really had no idea, no hint at all, that he was married?
No idea at all, but I'll tell you, I was thinking about it this morning.
I don't feel strange in the least about going out with a divorced person.
- What do you mean?
He's married.
- Now he's married.
And suppose now he's happily married?
You know, sometimes you're very depressing.
Boy, I wish they'd get here.
No, I don't.
I just wish it were over.
You're nervous over nothing.
I don't see what your big gripe is about Howard.
I mean, so he likes you.
No, no.
No, Rhoda, he doesn't like me.
He likes me!
All that love just rushing at you.
That, as my grandmother used to say, should be the worst thing that should happen to you.
Get that stuff away from me.
I'm fainting from hunger.
It isn't gonna kill you to eat something.
Break my diet the day I see Armond?
Not a chance.
Geronimo.
Hello, I'm Mary Richards.
Good evening.
I'm Armond Lynton, and this is my wife, Mrs. Armond Lynton.
How do you do?
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you very much.
Oh, just call me Nancy.
He loves to call me Mrs. Armond Lynton.
We've only been married for three weeks.
- That's how Rhonda and I met.
- Rhoda.
Excuse me.
Rhoda.
Armond and I think it's just wonderful of you to have us over.
I mean, considering how you met.
I think it's just super that we should all be good friends.
Isn't it?
When I ran over Armond, I never dreamt I'd find myself a new girlfriend, Nancy.
Excuse me.
- Got ya!
Oh-ho!
- H-Howard?
I just had to get that on film after all these years.
Ohh, Mary Uh - Ohh, Mary!
- Ohh Howard.
I can't believe it!
- Mary Richards!
- Yes.
It's so good to see you, Howard.
- Would you like to come in?
- Just try to stop me.
Must be kidding.
After all these years, do I want to come in?
Boy, oh, boy, is she wonderful?
Ahh.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm another person in the room.
- Rhoda Morgenstern.
- Howard Arnell.
How do you do?
And this is my date, Mr. and Mrs. Armond Lynton.
Excuse me.
I strained my arm.
- Can I get you a drink?
- Oh, sure, Mar.
The, uh, the usual.
- Uh, the usual?
- Yeah.
- Scotch and s - Scotch and s - Scotch and soda.
- Yeah, I knew you'd remember.
Oh, Mary, I just can't get over how you look.
Terrific!
A-1 terrific.
Isn't that little gal there the most gorgeous thing on the Earth?
- Isn't she?
- I'm supposed to answer that.
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
She certainly is - A-1 terrific.
- Yeah.
- That's nice of you to say, but really!
- Oh, no, no, no.
Come on.
Who's more gorgeous than you?
- Oh, Howard.
- No, name one person.
- Lots of people.
- Who?
- Well, there's - Her.
Well, after all, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, right?
I mean, Mary is great looking, and Nancy's gorgeous.
And Rhoda's nice looking too.
Yeah.
Guess how long it's been since Mar and I saw each other.
No, come on.
Just take a potshot.
Howard, they're not interested in guessing how long it's been.
Oh, all right.
I'll tell ya.
The last time I saw Mary was the Fourth of July, 1966.
Oh, and you remember it because it was Independence Day.
No, 'cause it's the last time I saw Mary.
Uh I think I'll just go see if there are some more bacon curls.
- Not too many.
- Me either.
I don't want to spoil my dinner.
Look at that woman.
Boy, are we in for a treat.
You are looking at the greatest little gourmet cook in the Western Hemisphere.
Uh, Rhoda, could I see you in the kitchen - for just a moment?
- Sure.
- Excuse me, Armond.
- Certainly.
And Nancy.
Oh, and Howard.
Rhoda, I thought 8:30 so obviously meant after dinner.
- Maybe you can whip up something quick.
- Whip up something quick.
Right, right.
Yes, I can whip up a carrot.
I can whip up a baked potato.
Nothing!
Nothing!
The only thing I have in my refrigerator is a lightbulb.
I'm just gonna have to go out there and tell 'em.
What else can I do?
I don't know what she'll be cooking.
Either chicken in pineapple shell or duckling with wine sauce.
Uh, listen, everybody, on the subject of the duck in the wine sauce, there's been kind of an interesting situation.
And the situation is that you thought that this was for dinner, and, of all things, it's not.
- You're saying this isn't for dinner?
- No, I'm not saying that.
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
Well, it really doesn't matter.
I mean, it really doesn't matter because because, uh Because we've eaten.
We had a late lunch before we came here.
Seriously.
Yes, seriously, we did.
Right before.
Also, I had a very big breakfast.
- We're stuffed.
- Well, if you're sure?
Oh, yeah, really.
Say, this is such a nice apartment.
Don't you think this is a nice apartment, Nancy?
- Oh, I certainly do.
- It's really pleasant.
Incidentally, are there any more of those - Bacon curls?
- Yeah.
Um, no.
- How 'bout a carrot?
- Thank you.
You know, Mar, I just can't get over how you look.
I mean, you are really something.
Most gals, you know, look their best when they're in their 20s.
But this little gal here, I'm telling you.
Mary, the older you get, the sexier you look.
Uh, Howard.
Say, I've got an idea for posterity.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Pictures.
Who knows when Nance and I will see each other again?
Howard, you really wanna do that now?
Oh, no, we can wait till after dinner.
Oh.
Isn't that funny?
Why do I think we're gonna have dinner?
I've got a good idea, Howard.
Why don't you take some pictures of us all?
Okay.
Come here.
Help me out here, Armond.
I'm dying to get a couple of Mar and I together.
I'm not sure I know about this kind of camera.
What's to know?
Just push the button there.
Well, okay.
Oh!
G I'm terribly sorry.
It's really all my fault.
No, no, it's all right.
I don't know how to apologize.
No, no.
Listen, it's all right.
It's just the pictures I took of the total eclipse of the sun.
Mary, I think we'd better be going.
We both want to thank you for a lovely evening.
- The bacon curls were delicious.
- I'll get your coats.
I have to get up early in the morning anyway.
I'm playing golf.
- It's snowing.
- Well, I'm not that good.
- Good night.
We enjoyed it.
- Have to do it again.
- Yeah, assuredly.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mary.
- Good night.
The next total eclipse in Minneapolis is in 2099.
- No kiddin'.
- Yeah.
Of course, there's a partial in 1979.
That's only nine years.
Excuse me, please.
I'm going into the kitchen, and I'm not coming out until I find something edible.
Mary, you're not tired or anything?
Uh, well, I am a little.
It's been kind of a long evening.
Yes, and I know what you've been thinking all evening too.
- Oh, n-no, I haven't.
- Yes, yes, you have.
You've been thinking what I've been thinking how great we are together.
- That's it, isn't it?
- Well, not exactly.
No, not exactly, no.
You want me to say what exactly is?
Do you want me to say the words?
I'll say the words marriage.
There, I said the words.
I'm not surprised at this.
You're a woman.
You have a right to expect something to come of this.
No, Howard, I don't think I have that right.
Yes.
Yes, you do.
Ah, Mary.
You're so great.
You're so great, you'll probably understand this.
Mary, I can't marry you.
You can't?
Well, Howard, I understand.
I really do.
I gotta have my freedom.
I gotta!
See, the way things are now, Mar, I'm free just to pick up and go whenever I please, wherever I please.
The sky is the limit.
I get the desire to jet up to Duluth, one phone call, that's it.
I get the urge maybe to spend a weekend in St. Paul, it's done.
See, I can't be tied down.
You do understand, don't you?
Oh, Howard, I really do.
I understand.
No, no.
I don't think you do understand.
Yes, I do.
I'd just be hurt, and you're saving me from all that hurt.
I mean, wow!
I never knew anyone who saved me from so much hurt.
l I better go.
Even the sound of your voice makes me crazy.
If you say one more word, you'll make me change my mind.
Uh Mm-mmm.
Mm-mmm.
Where's my coat?
Mary Richards.
Little Mary Richards.
Say, Mar, you know something?
I'd like to have something of yours, you know, to remember tonight.
Uh Well, uh Oh, no, come on.
That's too nice.
- Here, let me pay you for it.
- Oh, no, Howard.
Really, it's broken.
It leaks fluid.
Come on, tell me.
I insist.
Ten, twenty.
Twenty-eight.
Howard, please, just take it.
Thanks, Mar.
Mary, no good-byes, huh?
- Right.
- Good-bye, Mary.
- Good-bye, Howard.
- Good-bye.
- Did he leave?
- Uh, yeah, he left.
He He wants me to forget him.
See, he's gotta be free.
- Is that what he said?
- Yeah, yeah.
Then he took my lighter and he walked out of my life forever.
Rhoda, never, never again.
Right.
Tonight I took a vow, and I'm gonna keep it.
- What's that?
- Next time I'm asked out, no matter how lonely I feel, I'm not gonna say yes unless it's a couple I really like.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all So, my fan club wants the answers to all these questions.
I don't know why they want to know.
What difference does it make what my favorite color is?
I'm just a guy.
Just an ordinary guy.
Well, that's the way fan clubs are.
Just had a couple of lucky breaks.
Well, okay, maybe a little extra this or that.
Dash of charisma, innate sense of style.
I don't know.
I'm just a guy.
Just a guy who happens to dig the color blue.
I was holding my breath there.
There were those of us who were betting on red.
Did you read any funny stories on the wire we can close the show with tonight?
- Uh, no, sorry.
- Any unfunny stories we can close with?
- Nope.
- Did you hear any good jokes recently?
"What's my favorite dessert"?
Honestly, you'd think I was some sort of god or something.
Baked Alaska.
Baked Alaska.
Wait a minute.
That sounds a little airy.
Maybe I oughta make it a little more substantial, like apple pie?
Are you saying you're actually going to lie about what your favorite dessert is?
I was just kidding.
Can't you tell when I'm kidding?
Baked Alaska.
Apple laska.
I've got my closer.
Now, listen to this, Mary.
"A new social club in Minneapolis is holding a branch meeting tonight.
The club, for divorced people only, is called the Better Luck Next Time club".
Oh, it's so awful, it's great.
Wh- Wh- What's so awful about a club for divorced people?
Come on, Mary.
Would you join it?
- Well, no, I wouldn't.
- Aha!
Uh, Murray, I wouldn't join it because "A," I don't happen to be divorced, and "B," I'm just not a joiner.
But I think for people who are, uh Divorced joiners.
That's the phrase you're looking for.
I think it's a good idea.
It's a way for people to meet people, like all clubs.
What's this thing about meeting, like it's some big, mysterious thing?
- It's easy.
Take Marie and me.
- How'd you two meet?
- She saved my life.
- What?
It was no big deal.
I was skydiving once.
My chute didn't open.
Hers did.
She made a terrific catch.
Right.
Mary - I need your advice about something.
- Yeah, sure, Ted.
Not that it's important, but, uh, do you think it sounds too risque for an anchorman to say he sleeps in the raw?
You gotta snap.
Yeah, right, Mar.
You gotta snap.
I don't wanna snap.
Hey, Mar, was that your idea to do that divorce club thing on tonight's news?
- Uh, no.
- Oh.
- Well, I was thinking about it, and - Jog.
Uh, yeah.
You know something?
We oughta join.
Join a club for divorced people?
Sure.
Why not?
Wh- Why not?
Yeah.
Give me one good reason.
- Give you one good reason?
- Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Rhoda, you should already be aware of this good reason: we're not divorced.
A technicality.
So we say we're divorced.
You actually want to lie about being divorced?
Forward.
Mary, you talk about it like I'm asking you to deny your birthright, like being single's part of your heritage.
It's a drag saying you're 30 and single all the time.
You know it is.
I know, I know.
Good.
We're done.
And then that ever-popular question How come a girl like you isn't married?
How come you're still single?
I could discover the secret of immortality and people would still say, "Look at that single girl discovering the secret of immortality".
That is exactly what I'm talking about.
Imagine the relief of not having to go through that.
You meet someone.
You don't have to explain why you're not married.
- You're divorced.
- You know something, Rhoda?
- It really is all very, uh - Right.
- But mostly it's crazy.
- Look at it from my point of view.
Dressing dummies in a department store window is not the best way to get into the social swim.
Unless someone comes up and kisses the glass, I've had it.
Rhoda, I am not joining a club for divorced people.
- You might as well change the subject.
- Okay, okay.
My new subject is Paris, France.
You know that trip to Paris you've never been able to afford?
There's this club, Mar.
If you join and are a member for six months, you can get a charter flight for just $300.
- Three hundred dollars?
- That's right.
- What's the club?
- The divorced people's club.
- Ohh!
- Aha!
That stopped you, didn't it?
- And on top of that, you speak French.
- Spanish.
Ah, they speak anything in Paris.
The Left Bank.
Gene Kelly.
"April in Paris".
Chestnuts in blossom.
Okay, Rhoda, I'll do it.
But promise me we're just gonna get our membership cards and leave.
- Right?
- Promise.
Right.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna change, shower.
- I'll meet you in half an hour.
- Okay.
Do you know what I'm doing?
I am changing my clothes at 8:00 at night so I can go to a club where I'm gonna lie about being divorced so that I can, perhaps, in a few months time, end up in Paris speaking Spanish.
You too?
Hmm.
You're the tenth person who's told me that today.
- Are you new here?
- Uh, yes.
Are you interested in buying a house?
- Uh, no.
I don't think so.
- Uh-uh.
Right.
Nice to meet you.
It's starting.
It's starting already.
I hear these little voices saying, "Get out while you can".
Is that what yours say?
My voices usually tell me to go save France.
Will you relax.
Oh, hi!
Welcome to the Better Luck Next Time social club.
I'm Karen Norris, your Better Luck Next Time registration gal, and this is Dr. Walter Udall, our president and also your Better Luck Next Time registration guy.
Oh, and also your Better Luck Next Time resident dentist.
Incredible.
Are you aware of the fact that you have incredible teeth, young lady?
Oh.
Thank you.
Brushing after meals, electric toothbrush, sugarless gum.
You're into that whole bag, right?
Oh, yes, I guess so.
I didn't even have to ask.
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.
And with that mouth, you won't need it.
You came on a big night.
We're electing officers.
Fill out this application.
Your name, please.
- Uh, Mary Richards.
- Mary Richards.
And your maiden name, Mrs. Richards?
Uh, my, uh, eh Uh, Mrs. Richards Excuse me, Karen, but you know how I get.
Tell me, uh, did you have such beautiful teeth even before your marriage went on the rocks?
I beg your pardon?
So often after a divorce a woman decides to spruce herself up.
Naturally, the first thing she thinks about is her teeth and gums.
Well, I can say, as an objective bystander, that Mrs. Richards's teeth were as beautiful the day she married Stefano as they are today.
Look, uh, about those applications, could Mary and I just fill them out ourselves?
Certainly, if it makes it easier, Mrs., um Miss Morgenstern.
Rhoda Morgenstern.
Miss Morgenstern?
He thought it was in the best interest of the space program that I retain my maiden name.
The program!
You were married to an astronaut.
- Which one?
- Please.
I'd rather not say anymore.
You know, word gets out, people start hitting you up for moon rocks.
Oh, um, Rhoda, didn't you want to inquire about the, uh What was it?
- Charter flights to Paris.
- Of course.
Yes, we're going to jot down the names of those interested after the meeting.
Meantime, introduce yourselves to some of the other divorceds.
Okay.
Unbelievable teeth.
I knew this was gonna happen.
We're gonna be here all night.
Aw, come on.
It's okay, Mar.
Just a few hours.
Just act natural and try to look divorced.
Hi.
My name is Frances Franklin, but everybody calls me Sparkie.
I don't know why.
All my friends say I sparkle and bubble.
They say since I'm divorced I'm like another person, all sparkling.
That's why they call me Sparkie.
Isn't that crazy?
Yes.
Listen, do you know who the guy in the argyles is?
Uh, no, we're new here, so Hi!
You're new here.
- The name's Roy.
This is my buddy Hal.
- How are you?
Roy, Hal, I'm Mary.
This is Rhoda and, uh, Sparkie.
Uh, no, my real name is Frances Franklin, but all my friends call me Sparkie.
I don't know why.
I guess it's 'cause I sparkle and bubble all the time.
Uh-huh.
Listen, I want to warn you about this place.
It's filled with losers.
It's up to here with losers that you wouldn't believe.
- You know what I mean?
- Nothin'but losers.
But if you really want me to steer you clear from the losers, just call on me, because I can do it for you.
- The name is, uh, Roy.
- Roy.
- R-O-Y.
- That's it.
I'll talk to you later.
Sparkie, huh?
So long, Roy.
He's such a loser.
Look, I, uh, I wanted to talk to you anyway.
You're the spitting image of my ex-wife.
Oh, really?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Except she wore her hair up.
And how long have you been a member of this so-called social club, may I ask?
Well, you know Yeah, if you had it on top of your head, you'd look exactly like her.
- Well, excuse me.
- What?
I said, excuse me.
I seem to be interrupting something.
Oh, no.
Not a bit.
Let's try it, shall we?
Let's just put it up.
You see, now, that looks terrible.
- So did she.
- Y-Y-Yes.
Hey, you wanna buy a Ah, you're no good.
I asked you.
Rhoda, now.
Please?
- Uh, what'd you say your name was?
- Mary.
- Wanna split?
- Uh, no, thank you.
Well, what'd you come here for if you don't wanna leave?
I came here for the meeting.
Oh, the meeting.
What about what's-her-name?
Hey, you wanna split?
Uh, no, I'm already splitting with Roy.
We're gonna take flashlights and go hunting for losers.
Well, if you change your mind, you know where I'll be.
Remember the name Hal.
You might want a tall one.
You never know.
Leaving!
Going away!
Saying bye-bye to the creepies!
- Mary, please, give it a chance.
- No more!
You're not leaving now, are you?
The meeting's just about to start.
There.
You see, Mary?
We can't go yet.
- Uh, that's, uh, Freddie.
- Freddie?
Yeah, my younger brother.
Nice-looking boy, isn't he?
Not one filling.
Wonderful.
Dr. Udall, can you tell me when we'll be getting to the charter flights?
We probably won't be getting to that till next time.
Why?
Well, tonight's the night when we each stand up and, in intimate detail, tell all about what led to our divorces.
Well, I don't think I can do that.
- Why not?
- Well, uh, because, uh - Because the details were embarrassing.
- Yes, uh, humiliating.
- Sordid, even.
- Oh, really?
Well, then you can go first.
He said we could sign up for the charter flight next week.
That is not what I'm upset about, and you know it, Rhoda.
The story of how you got divorced?
You did that terrific.
It isn't that either.
Just relax.
We'll sit down and talk.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Phyllis.
I was at my new club.
My new, uh, social club.
Uh, we call it the Better Luck Next Time club.
It's for divorced people.
- Don't go into that with her.
- No, no, I'm not kidding.
How did you guess?
She said, "It was Rhoda's idea".
Yeah, it was.
Rhoda's dumb idea.
Yeah, you're right.
It makes perfect sense not to go back.
There's only one thing.
Due to the efforts of a dental admirer of mine - We'll think of something.
- I am the new vice president.
Mrs. Richards?
Right in there, please.
- Oh.
- Hello, Doctor.
Oh, Mrs. Richards.
You just sit right down here.
I have been looking forward to this ever since you called.
Did the nurse take your X rays yet?
Yes, even though I kept telling her I didn't want to see you professionally.
You don't mean you're going to call the examination off.
I canceled three appointments to get you in.
- Well, no, I want an examination too.
- Ohh!
Ohh!
Goodness, you gave me quite a start there, I'm telling you.
I mean, to have that mouth in this chair and not to get at it Okay, all right, when was the last time you had your teeth examined?
Uh, Thursday.
Thursday?
Well, they say you should always get a second opinion.
Mrs. Richards, you are one in a million.
You're a dentist's dream.
I, l You know l May I?
Oh, please.
You know, not enough people really care about their teeth.
Or, for that matter, their gums.
See, professionally speaking, I'm a gum man myself.
Do you, by any chance, keep up with gums?
Well, uh, not any more than I've needed just to get along.
Yeah, well well, you might have heard lately that, uh, teeth themselves are nowhere.
I mean, teeth are still teeth, God bless 'em, but, uh, but people are finally realizing that gums are where it's at.
I have to tell you something.
You don't have to feel self-conscious.
After all, I am a dentist.
Uh, well, it's just that it's well, it's so embarrassing.
Embarrassing?
You don't know how much you trust me already.
- l-I do?
- Why, of course.
How many strangers do you know who you'd let put their fingers in your mouth?
- Well, yes, that's that's true.
- Yeah, see?
Dr. Udall, I am not divorced.
Oh, well, you haven't got your final decree yet.
I haven't even gotten married yet.
I'm single.
I know.
It sounds terrible.
But, well, you had these charter flights to Europe, and I know I shouldn't All right, lean back.
Let's get on with the examination, please.
Uh, Dr. Udall, did you hear what I said?
You said nothing.
This conversation never took place.
Mouth, please.
Uh, Mrs. Ri Oh, Miss Richards.
Is that right?
Your last name is Richards?
I had that coming.
I know it.
I had You bit my probe.
- I'm sorry.
- Open.
Miss Richards, are you aware of what it's like to place some unknown person's name, nominate them against a club favorite, the incumbent?
I had that coming too.
I did.
- And You're biting it again.
- Sorry!
- And you know who that incumbent was?
- Yes, I do.
My younger brother Freddie.
I nominated you, and you beat out my kid brother Freddie.
Do you know how close I am to Freddie?
Uh, pretty close?
Yes.
Until I nominated you.
And you have the nerve to sit there and tell me you are single.
All right, this examination is over.
However, unless you wish to humiliate me completely, you'll be at that meeting next Wednesday.
Yes, sir, yes.
- There's only one thing, of course.
- What?
How am I gonna get married and divorced by next Wednesday?
Hurry.
Mary, I been circulating.
I got bad news.
Those two guys we met last week?
Roy and Hal?
- They're the cream of the crop.
- Oh, Rhoda, would you Do you realize that in five minutes I have to stand up on this stage, face those people there and tell them the truth?
- I don't know how I'm gonna put it.
- Take it easy, kid.
I know how you feel.
You can't imagine what you'll say.
It seems impossible that it'll turn out right.
- Then something pops into your head?
- No, you usually just bomb.
Oh, Rhoda!
Cheese it!
The divorceds are coming.
So, anyway, in this dream It was kind of peculiar.
I dreamt I was with somebody who looks exactly like you.
How does it feel to be elected vice president?
Uh, well, it feels like I'd like a recount.
Anyway, in this dream, this person that looked like you was so wonderful.
And we were having a really great time.
- No kidding.
- Then I asked him to come home with me.
- What?
- I asked him to come home with me.
Kooky, huh?
Kooky.
You wanna split?
You and I get a little six-pack and, uh Huh?
Okay.
Let's go sit down, and I'll tell you about the rest of my kooky dream.
Yeah, tell me all of it.
Uh-oh.
Bad news.
Hello, Miss No-Name.
Hello, Dr. Udall.
That's my brother Freddie, the ex-incumbent.
I'd just as soon you didn't meet.
Dr. Udall, I really feel just terrible about all this.
Uh, oh, by the by, I got you off the hook.
All you have to do is confirm my story by announcing to the others the divorced others that you've reconciled with your husband.
Gee, Mary, that's great.
Here's hoping you and Stefano make it this time.
Oh, incidentally, your not-paid-for-yet X rays came back today.
You have a cavity.
And I'm not going to tell you where.
Mary.
Now you don't have to tell the truth.
- That's terrific!
- Yeah, it's terrific.
All I have to do is lie.
A little more practice, I might get very good at it.
Mary, we'll start the meeting now.
Now, in a little while I'll have news about our Tuesday night "Where It's At" excursion to the hippie quarter.
But first of all, we'd like to have a word from our brand-new vice president Mary Richards.
- All right, Mar!
- No, no.
Please.
Please.
I, uh, I guess that I'll just make it short and sweet.
As you may have heard, I am reconciling with my husband.
So it, uh, turns out that I can't be your vice president any longer.
So, uh But you've all been just lovely.
I want to thank you.
So, uh thank you.
Didn't she just get elected last week?
Hey, didn't you just get elected last week?
- Yes, I was.
- Listen, I think that's lousy!
You're planning a reconciliation, and we elect you vice president Uh, order!
Order!
No, I didn't plan the reconciliation.
It just, uh, happened.
Oh, what a loser.
No, no, no.
No, wait, everybody, wait.
Listen, we all know how often these reconciliations work out hardly ever.
I say let's let her stay vice president until she sees what happens.
Order.
Order.
That makes sense to me.
We should have a little vote.
After all, it's a democracy.
- No.
Order.
- No vote!
No, because it's a lie.
It is!
You know it's a lie.
I am not divorced.
I was not even ever married.
I'm single!
It's just that, well, you had these inexpensive trips to Europe, and it just didn't seem so bad at the time, lying to a club.
But it turned out that I was lying to people.
I'm I'm sorry, and I just wish that someone would say something.
That's a lousy thing you did.
Yeah, I do.
And I did it too.
Yeah.
I lied.
It's true, folks.
The fact is, my divorce is not yet final.
The Space Center is holding it up, so I'm not eligible either.
So if you cast a stone at this poor unfortunate, cast one at me too, Miss Rhoda Morgenstern.
Okay, okay.
Roy Vickerson, age 33.
Single.
Now, I don't know why I did it, but I couldn't help myself.
I mean, the Young Republicans, the Young Democrats, they were such losers.
They were!
I lied too.
But then, that's the kind of crazy, kooky person I am.
Richie Raider.
l-I'm not m-married.
I never even went steady.
Anybody wanna start a new club?
Boy, you sure know how to clear a room.
The only ones who were really divorced were Mrs. Norris, Dr. Udall and his brother.
You can't blame the man for hating you.
You shot his whole club out from under him.
Hi.
Hi.
What happened to your date with Hal?
We never got out of the parking lot.
We had an argument over whose car to take.
His was a camper.
What are you girls doing tonight?
I feel like doing something really crazy and kooky.
- Sorry, I don't feel up to kooky.
- Or crazy.
Oh.
You know, I had another dream last night.
It was all about teeth.
It was a beautiful day.
There I was, and I was surrounded by all these dazzling teeth, and there were soft, dental floss clouds in the sky.
Hello, Dr. Udall.
Would you care to go next door for some punch?
Oh!
Do they have punch?
No.

- How do I do that?
Well, I brought the stuff.
Here, I'll show you.
- What's that?
- To give it an antique look.
Stand back.
If you've got any hostilities, this is a marvelous way to work 'em off.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- I haven't had this much fun in years.
- Here, you try it.
- Well, um Yeah, maybe later.
- No, no, go ahead.
- Well, I feel a little silly.
Well All right.
What's so funny?
I just feel silly hitting, uh, with, uh Okay, all right.
I'll-I'll Apparently, you have some kind of a hang-up about this.
Either get over it, or buy yourself genuine antiques.
- See ya later.
- Okay.
I don't have any hang-ups.
- Who is it?
- It's nobody.
Uh, can I help you?
- No, I'm fine.
Thanks.
- Oh.
I thought I heard something hit the door.
- It was just my head.
- Your head?
I was leaning back to rest against your door, and I misjudged the distance.
- But don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah, positive.
- Well, uh I'm sorry you didn't get to marry that fella who was gonna marry you.
My daughter wrote me all about it, Mary.
You're Rhoda's mother!
Oh, for heaven's sake.
She lives right upstairs.
- Let me help you carry your bags.
- She isn't home.
Well, then, come on in here and wait.
I'd like to come in, in fact, I'm curious about your apartment.
- Oh, why is that?
- Rhoda's place must look like yours.
Oh, well, actually, her place doesn't look at all like this.
She said your place was twice as nice as hers, so I figured if I lop off 50%, I got it.
Well, please, come in and sit down.
- I don't wanna inconvenience you.
- You won't inconvenience me.
- You sure?
- People sit down in here all the time.
Practically every time somebody comes in that door, they sit down.
Rhoda was right.
You got a cute personality.
Don't stop what you were doing.
I wasn't doing anything.
I'll do it later.
I don't wanna inconvenience you.
Look, go back to what you were doing.
No.
Okay, please, sit down.
All right, I'll go back to what I was doing.
It's, uh, something that you do to furniture.
- Uh-huh.
- Um No, really, I'll-I'll show you.
Well, it's nice to have a hobby that makes you happy.
Hello?
Mary, this is Rhoda.
And don't say, "Hello, Rhoda".
Okay.
Uh, hi.
And why?
I wanna ask you a question, but I don't want you to answer with a yes or no.
- Why?
- Because a lot of yeses and nos would seem suspicious if there's someone there with you.
- There's someone there with you?
- Yes.
- I told you not to say yes.
- Well, how else am l I've got a code worked out.
Now, listen.
If the answer is "yes," say a word beginning with the letter "A".
If the answer is "no," say a word beginning with the letter "B".
All right?
Is my mother there?
Uh, apples.
I thought so.
Does she know I'm home upstairs here?
You're Bagel.
Could you make up some excuse and then come upstairs here real quick?
Uh, well, I really I don't Uh, abracadabra.
- Good.
I'll see you in a minute then.
- Okay, Rhoda.
Did you see my mother just look up when you said, "Okay, Rhoda"?
Alabama.
Rhoda.
You just come barging into a person's room without knocking on the beads?
Rhoda, why don't you wanna see your mother?
Because I looked out my window and saw her carrying that down the street.
- She asked me to give it to you.
- I don't want it.
Your mother comes all the way from New York to bring you a present, and you Don't want it.
Right.
Mary, I send her $50 a month in New York.
You know what she does with it?
Buys me gifts, and then she brings them to me.
I gotta make her stop doing that kind of stuff, Mar.
Rhoda, she probably brings you the presents because she loves you.
I love her too, but she makes me crazy!
- How?
- Read the card on that gift.
I guarantee you it'll be something that makes me crazy.
"No one in the world will ever love you as much as I do".
- That's lovely.
- To the naked eye, it's lovely.
But think about it, Mary.
I'm 30 years old, right, and single.
No matter where I go or who I meet or how long I may live, no one will ever love me as much as she does.
That's not a card.
That's a curse.
What about your father?
Does he make you crazy too?
No.
I was five years old before I knew my father could talk.
You know the first thing he said?
"Listen to your mother".
Now do you understand, Mar?
No, Rhoda, I'm sorry.
I don't.
Your mother is down there.
You're up here.
You say you love her You're talking about Midwestern love.
I'm talking about Bronx love.
There's a certain amount of guilt that goes with that.
My mother wants the people she loves to feel guilty.
Like with her pills.
- Her pills?
- Right.
Pills.
My mother hasn't been taking her pills for as long as I can remember.
What hasn't she been taking them for?
I've never been sure.
For all I know, they're an aphrodisiac.
No more, Mary, really.
If she needs those pills, she'll take 'em herself.
- You really won't see your mother?
- No!
Okay, Rhoda.
Mary?
Ask her if she's been taking her pills, huh?
I'm just having a little snack.
I wish you'd let me fix you something to have for dinner.
Oh, no, I never eat.
I just nibble.
Well, if you're still hungry, there's half a chicken in the refrigerator.
Not anymore.
That's what I nibbled.
Mrs. Morgenstern, you take the bed.
I just changed the sheets this morning.
- Where you gonna sleep?
- Right here on the two chairs.
- Makes a pretty good bed.
- Oh, no, no.
I can't let you do that.
Yes, I'll be perfectly comfortable.
I'm putting you out.
I'm gonna spend the night in a motel.
Do you think they'll let me in without a car?
Mrs. Morgenstern, you're not putting me out.
I found a motel down by the bus station for only five dollars a night.
- But, Mrs. Morgenstern - I only hope it's clean.
But, Mrs. Morgenstern, if it'll make you stay, you can sleep on the chair.
All right, I'll stay.
Good.
What are you doing?
That's what it'd cost me in that fleabag, so I'm certainly gonna pay you.
- No, I couldn't take your money.
- Come on.
Don't be silly.
- For sleeping on my chair?
- I want you to have the money.
No, Mrs. Morgenstern.
I couldn't take it.
Well, okay, have it your way.
Enough.
Enough.
- Good night, Mrs. Morgenstern.
- Good night.
- Sleep well.
- You too.
This is gonna kill my back.
Would you like another cup of coffee before I leave for work?
Mrs. Morgenstern?
Hello?
Uh, come in.
Oh, thanks.
I'd love some.
- Where's Ida?
- Ida?
- Ida.
Mrs. Morgenstern.
- Oh!
How can you live with a woman for three days and not know her first name?
Well, I just never thought of her as having a first name.
Oh, Mary, that's so you.
Calling a woman She doesn't want to be called Mrs. Morgenstern.
Yeah, well, I can't call her what she wants me to call her.
- Ida?
- Mama.
Hello?
Yes.
Who is this?
Yes, Mrs. Morgenstern is still living here.
No, I don't know when she Rhoda, is this you?
Yes, it is too you, Rhoda, so you can stop using the Italian accent.
Rhoda, if you're so concerned about your mother, why don't you come down and see her for yourself?
I don't know if she's taking her pills.
I'm sure if she's supposed to, she's taking them.
Good-bye, Rhoda.
Mrs. Morgenstern, where have you been?
- Out shopping.
Hello, Phyllis.
- Hi, Ida.
You were out in the snow wearing just that?
I thought if I went rummaging in the closet looking for my coat, I might disturb some of your lovely things.
Let me get out of your way.
I still can't understand what it is about Ida that upsets you so.
- You can't?
Well, okay.
There's things like things like that.
- Like what?
- She's washing the dishes.
- What's wrong with that?
- I already washed the dishes.
Mary, it's just her way of showing how she appreciates what you're doing.
- You should open the gift she got you.
- I'm afraid to.
- Oh, Mary.
- Okay, all right, fine.
Okay, I'm gonna open the present.
You'll see.
The minute I open this, I'm gonna be in so much trouble.
- Now, don't you feel a bit ridiculous?
- I, uh, feel a lot ridiculous.
Well, I'm glad I could help you, Mary.
Bye, Ida!
Mrs. Morgenstern.
- I really like the scarves.
- You really like them?
- Oh, yes, I love them.
- It's nice of you to say that anyway.
No, I'm not just saying that, Mrs. Morgenstern.
I really love these scarves.
- Well - No, really.
Look, I'm gonna wear one.
Look.
I'll wear it to work.
This color is absolutely perfect.
Huh?
How about that?
I'm sorry you don't like the other one.
Uh, Mrs. Morgenstern, uh, did you take your pills today?
Mama?
- Mary, could I ask you something?
- Yes.
Why are you wearing two scarves today?
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
- Did you get that list I asked for?
- Uh, what list?
- Of film.
- What film?
For the special we're doing tomorrow night.
And don't say, "What special"?
- I won't.
- But you want to, right?
Did I just go - Yes, you did.
- That's what I thought.
When I go it's a pretty good sign my blood pressure's getting up there.
My doctor says I've gotta learn to relax or give up drinking.
So I'm gonna learn to relax right now!
- Murray?
- What?
- What special are we doing?
- "Is Air Pollution Really So Bad"?
What kind of a television station does a special favoring air pollution?
One where the chairman of the board owns a smelting plant.
- Mary?
- Yeah, Ted?
Could I have that new insignia?
This one's - Ted, I'm sorry.
I left it at home.
- You better go home and get it.
I tell you, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
I'm so busy today.
- I can't go on without that insignia.
- Well I've got somebody staying with me.
I'll call and see if she can bring it over.
The threads came loose.
Terrific!
- She said she was gonna be in all day.
- What about my insignia?
If she changed her plans, she would have told me.
- I want my insignia.
- Maybe she's in the shower.
- This has to be taken care of.
- Please, don't flap that at me.
Well, I'm not going to argue about this.
I'll just speak to Lou.
- Lou?
- Mary, don't worry what he says to Lou.
He can't say anything intelligible unless I write it down for him.
She still hasn't answered.
- Mary, get that stuff for me.
- What stuff?
Mary, come into my office.
Mr. Grant, I know what you wanna see me about.
I know what Ted told you.
I was supposed to bring in his W.J.M. insignia today, and I forgot.
I left it at home.
I called my friend's mother, who is staying with me, to have her bring it, and she wasn't home which has me upset because - You know what's got me really upset?
- I have no idea.
I just sounded nuts.
Sit down.
Mary, life is tough.
No, it's not really tough.
What do you mean, "not really"?
I give you a cliche, three dumb words, and you wanna argue with me?
- I said, "Life's tough".
- Well, yes, it is.
It's a little tough.
It's getting tougher all the time.
I'm not interested in your friend's mother.
That's tough.
I'm not interested in whether Ted gets his insignia or not.
That's tough too.
I gotta come up with a bunch of reasons why pollution isn't so bad, or the chairman of the board's gonna get pretty upset at me.
- Like I said, "Life is tough".
- You're right, Mr. Grant.
Life is-is tough.
Yeah.
You wanna know what else is tough?
If you don't start shaping up I'm gonna have to fire you.
Do you mean that?
No.
It's a scare tactic.
But I'll tell you what I do mean.
For the last few days, you've been doing a rotten job around here.
Oh, Mr. Grant, I know.
The last couple of days, I've been a little off.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Not a little off.
Rotten!
There's two things I'm trying to get through to you life is tough, and you've been rotten.
Okay.
I have been.
It's just all I can think about is Rhoda and her mother.
I've let you down.
Murray's been doing half of my work for me.
The last couple of days, I've been just rotten.
Well, look, you know, you've been a little off, that's all.
No, I've been rotten.
What happened here?
Mrs. Morgenstern, where have you been?
I've been calling all day.
I've been right here.
Now, don't get excited.
You didn't miss any messages.
Let's see.
At 11:00, somebody rang four times.
At 11:02, somebody rang six times.
And at 2:15, somebody rang fourteen times.
Listen, Mary, I've been noticing something.
You're getting nervous.
I think you should kick me out.
But, Mrs. Morgenstern, I couldn't I wouldn't kick you out.
I know.
It'd be very hard for you because you're so fond of me.
But you ought to kick me out.
- But l-l - No, look.
Now, you tell me that it's crowded here.
Go ahead.
Well, it's-it's a little crowded.
All right, you see.
Now you're doing fine.
I understand that.
Now, you wanna make it easy for me to go back to New York and make yourself feel better even though you're kicking me out?
Uh, yes.
- Then promise me you'll write.
- I promise.
- How often?
- I'll write at least once a week.
Mrs. Morgenstern, are you really going back to New York without seeing Rhoda?
- It's okay.
I got a letter from her.
- A letter?
Yeah.
She slipped it under the door.
Here we are.
I'll read it to you.
"Dear Ma Return the gift and make sure you get cash.
"Use it and the money in here to buy something for yourself, not me.
"I'm sorry I couldn't see you, but you know we'd end up yelling.
Love, Guess Who".
Oh, that Rhoda, she's always clowning.
Not every mother has a daughter like that.
I wish I could see the daughter I got like that.
Rhoda, listen.
I've gotta talk to you.
l Rhoda, I've gotta talk to you.
- Well, come on in.
- Well, listen.
Could we talk out there?
I feel a little funny here.
I'm sorry, Mary.
I gotta get this display done in a hurry.
I think the bride's in trouble.
Listen, uh, Rhoda, - You gonna ask how your mother is?
- How is she?
She's going home to New York tonight.
That's how she is.
- What do you want out of me?
- Rhoda, would it hurt you so much to go down to the bus station and say good-bye to her and hello?
- No, it wouldn't.
- Well, then?
But if I go down to that bus station, I won't get off with just a good-bye.
I see her, it sets me back 20 years, minimum.
Well, then, uh, don't turn around.
Hello, 1950.
All right, I told her that you'd be working late tonight.
Boy, my mother.
You gotta hand it to her.
She's got a back that could break your heart.
Ah, come on.
I always cry at weddings.
Hi.
Rhoda!
- Mama.
- Oh, you make me so happy!
- Let me take this.
- That's all right, dear.
Come on What do you got in here?
Oh, come on, darling.
Ah.
Oh.
It's the greatest coat I ever saw.
Now let's return it.
- Just try it on, will you?
- Try it on?
Mama.
You take the money I send you and you buy me a coat like this.
This is ridiculous.
This must've cost, what You still leave the price tags in your gifts, don't you?
Yeah.
Here.
Read it.
- Rhoda, you don't ask how much - Will you read it?
- $495.
- Ma!
Mrs. Morgenstern, what Rhoda's trying to say is she doesn't want you spending the money she sends to you on presents for her.
But I was saving the money for her.
I don't need the money.
- Your father's doing very well.
- What are you talking about?
A long time ago you wrote me that Dad had some big business reverses.
Reverses, yes, upwards.
Up until then he wasn't doing so hot.
- You've got money?
- We're comfortable.
If she says, "We're comfortable," I think I'm an heiress.
Hey, Heiress, try on the coat.
All right.
Oh, Rhoda!
Oh, Ma, this is gorgeous!
Okay, you don't like it.
Give me it back.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all Mary, come in here and help me look!
It's not on my desk.
I'm sure I left it in here.
Well, I can't find it, and I need it right now.
Why don't you go over there and sit down and let me look for it.
- Really, I'm good at finding things.
- All right.
That's not the way to look!
This is the way to look.
You look through that, and I'll look through this.
- You look through the wastebasket.
- I always get the glamour job.
- When did you last see it?
- See what?
Whatever it is we're looking for.
If it's gum, I just found it.
- It's the Eric Matthews interview.
- Who's Eric Matthews?
He's that guy who wrote that best-seller Are Men Obsolete.
- Ted has an interview with him.
- Yeah, for The Scrutiny Show.
Our spontaneous and unrehearsed look at people who make the news.
If we don't find that script, Ted goes in there spontaneous and unrehearsed.
That's bad.
Mr. Grant's office.
- I'm not here.
- He heard you say you're not here.
- Who is it?
- It's Ted.
- Where is he?
- Ted, where are you?
You're supposed to be here taping the Eric Matthews What did you say?
- What did he say?
- "Gotta foo huna four"?
- "Gotta foo huna four"?
- That sounds like Ted.
Ted, I can't understand Ted, do you have something in your mouth?
A "memomener"?
A thermometer.
You've got the flu and a temperature of 104.
Oh, Ted.
Just tell him to stay in bed and take it easy.
We'll figure something out.
Ted, you are just to stay in bed and not to worry.
We'll find a replacement.
Good-bye, Ted.
What are we gonna do about the 6:00 news tonight?
- Don't worry.
We have a standby.
- Who?
You?
What's so strange about that?
I was in radio.
Only, my hair went out about the time TV came in.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Murray L. Slaughter substituting for Ted Baxter.
Welcome to Scrutiny.
- Tonight's guest is Eric Matthews - Murray?
That's what we've been looking for.
Where'd you find it?
- I just picked it up.
- Oh, never mind where you find it.
- Go down and tape that interview.
- Are you kidding?
Look, it's ten after 5:00 now.
At 6:00 I'm making my TV debut.
That gives me less than an hour to check the wires, write my own copy and get a hair transplant.
Mary, you're gonna have to interview Matthews.
Me?
Oh, no, Mr. Grant.
I don't think I could do that.
I mean, I'm not ready to Not that I'm not flattered.
It's just that to go on camera in-in front of Will you calm down?
I didn't mean you'd go on the air.
I mean you'd go down to the studio, read the questions to Matthews while we tape him.
Then when Ted's better, we tape him asking the questions.
And then you take me out and edit him in later.
- Right.
- Oh, well.
I think I could do that.
That'll probably be a lot of fun.
Check that mike.
Harry, we'll start camera two on Matthews.
- Tom, I'm substituting for Ted.
- Right.
- Sit down so we can line you up?
- Okay.
Put camera three on Mary.
- Excuse me.
- We'll tape in two minutes, Mary.
- Uh, Mr. Matthews?
- Where am I?
Uh, you're in the studio.
- Yeah, what city?
- Minneapolis.
Oh, well.
- Thank you.
- Hi.
I'm sorry.
I've been on this tour promoting my book so long - All the cities are running together.
- Oh, really?
Like for instance, the other day I was sitting in my hotel room in Newark Iooking out the window at the beautiful view, and I realized if it was a beautiful view it couldn't be Newark.
- It must really be exhausting.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
by guys who've never read the book.
- Whose first question is always - Will you tell us about your book?
Right.
And then "What gave you the idea to write it"?
- Yeah, inane questions like that.
- Right.
Well, that takes care of the first two questions I was gonna ask you.
Then, the questions are rather good.
It's just my answers are dumb.
Right?
- Ted.
- Oh, no.
No, no.
That's not my Ted.
- I mean, I'm I'm not Ted Baxter.
- Oh, no.
- But you knew that already.
- Yeah, I figured.
I'm Mary Richards.
I'm the associate producer on the show.
Ted is sick.
So, I will ask you the questions he would have asked you.
Then later they'll take me out and edit him in.
Oh.
I'm sorry Ted's sick.
We were supposed to go out afterwards.
I got an idea, though.
Uh, why don't I take you out afterwards and we can edit Ted in later?
Stand by for air.
- How 'bout dinner?
- We'll talk about that later.
- Okay.
- In two!
Good evening and welcome to Scrutiny.
I'm Ted Baxter.
And tonight - Have you written other books?
- Three others, but they didn't do well.
Why did this book do so well and the others didn't?
Well, in the first place, this one got published.
Can you tell me when did you first begin to think that Are Men Obsolete was gonna be a best-seller?
When I saw that they'd put a picture of a naked lady on the cover.
Well, I see our time is up.
Our thanks to Eric Matthews.
This is Ted Baxter.
And we'll be back next week with Scrutiny.
Wait a minute.
I'd like to ask you a question, if I may.
- When are we gonna go to dinner?
- We'll talk about that later.
- When?
- Over dinner.
- And cut!
- Tom, I'm sorry about this last part.
Don't worry, Mary.
It's only tape.
We'll cut it out later.
Okay, fellas, it's a wrap.
- Okay, where should we go for dinner?
- I know of a cute little place Oh, gee, I had a great time tonight.
You know, usually a date means dinner or the movies or something.
- But, tonight was really different.
- How different?
Building a snowman in front of the Women's Lib headquarters is different.
Yeah.
I thought they'd get a kick out of watching him melt.
- You have a nice little apartment.
- Thank you.
- I see you've won your letter.
- Yeah.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Oh, no, thanks.
I love that print.
I've got that at home.
- How 'bout some brandy?
- Oh, no, thank you.
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.
I don't smoke.
Even before all the new evidence about smoking came out, I never did.
I was always afraid it would stunt my health.
You know something?
I think I'm gonna quit smoking.
Good for you!
That shows you got real willpower.
Nope, I'm out of cigarettes.
Hey!
Did I make it?
No, you're short.
Gee, tonight was great, Eric, the whole evening the dinner, the snowman, the art museum.
You got a nice collection here Matisse, Van Gogh.
My favorite artist, Toulouse-Lautrec - What's What's that?
- Huh?
It's my pillow to sit on.
Height, you know.
On these TV tours, you never know what you're gonna run into.
Not every television studio has nice tall chairs like you.
- There are none in here.
- What?
Cigarettes.
I decided to take up smoking again.
- Is there a drugstore around?
- Yeah, just down the street.
- About two doors.
- Okay.
- I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
- Okay.
Where's Harpo and Chico?
I, uh I, uh I was just, um, walking funny.
Just, uh, been walking funny all night.
I don't know what's gotten into me.
- Where you been, Mar?
- Out on a date.
- How was it?
- Well, I don't know.
It's not over yet.
I don't know how to break it to you, but you're all alone.
Yeah, well, he's gonna be back any second.
- Rhoda, could I ask a big favor?
- Sure.
What?
- Please go.
- Can't I meet him?
- No!
- Is he somebody I'm going out with?
- Mary, you don't have to sneak around.
- Would you just listen?
Mary, please.
Do I have to figure out what's wrong with this guy, or are you gonna tell me why you don't want me to meet him?
All right, I'll tell you why I don't want you to meet him.
It's because of this.
I understand.
He needs it because he's very short.
What's he do, stand on it?
That's why I don't want you to meet him.
You'll say something like that.
Thanks a lot.
You really think I'd make a derogatory remark about a person just because he's a shrimp?
Do you see what I mean?
Ah, the drugstore was closed, so I guess I'll quit smoking again.
Hi.
Got a cigarette?
Eric, I'd like you to meet my friend, Rhoda Morgenstern.
Rhoda, this is Eric Shrimp.
Oh, good one, Mary.
Just put the eye makeup on your mouth.
That's because you're upset.
You know how I know you're upset?
Not because you put mascara your mouth.
'Cause you're talking to yourself.
You wanna watch that, kid.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- So how'd it go last night?
- Rhoda, what's the matter with me?
Eric is intelligent, he's funny, he's good looking.
- And short.
- Very short.
You know what I am?
I found out something about myself that's pretty upsetting.
- I'm a height bigot.
- My best friend, a bigot.
Right.
Why else would I be so hung up about height?
Last night, I kept telling myself about all his great qualities.
Yet all I could think about was He asked me to go out with him tomorrow night.
I lied.
I said I was busy just because he's short.
- My father's short.
- It didn't bother your mother, did it?
Bother her?
She's the one who made him short.
He was over six feet when they got married.
Go ahead.
Joke about it if you want, but I just don't think I can.
I don't think it's funny to be a bigot.
I'm gonna do something about it right now.
I don't think you can turn yourself in for that.
Eric Matthews, please.
I'm gonna go out with him, and I'm gonna wear high heels.
I am gonna stand up straight and not think about being taller than he is.
I hope he takes me dancing.
Hello, Eric?
And so ladies and gentlemen, until tomorrow.
This is Murray L. Slaughter, substituting for Ted Baxter, saying good news and good night.
Hey, fellas, how was I?
Hey, Lou.
Catch the news?
- Uh-huh.
- How'd I do?
Well, you know me, Murray.
I don't go around passing out idle compliments.
I wouldn't say you were great if I didn't think so.
Hey, Lou, what about that new feature I put in"Animals in the News"?
Oh, yeah, I wanted to speak to you about that.
- Yes?
- Don't do it again.
Mary, when the people found out I was doing the news, we got a lot of calls.
- Right?
- Uh, well, one.
One call.
Well, who was it?
It was Ted calling to find out if he had a lot of calls because he wasn't here.
Keep up the fair work, Murray.
Hey, Lou, I wanna talk to you about that animal feature.
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi, Eric.
I'll be right with you.
Sorry I'm late.
I just got this jacket and wanted them to take the emblem off.
- It's beautiful.
Where'd you get it?
- Robertsons.
They have a marvelous men's shop.
Yeah?
I got this at the boy's department.
- Well, where we going tonight?
- The Stop 'N' Save.
- That's a supermarket.
- Right.
I'm a great cook and I wanted to watch that interview we did.
- So I wanted to cook dinner for you.
- Sounds marvelous.
- Let's go.
- Even if it's from the boys department.
- It's a great-looking jacket.
- Thank you.
- Why'd you take the emblem off?
- It was a ducky.
Tell me, Eric.
When did you first think that Are Men Obsolete might be a best-seller?
When I saw that they'd put a picture of a naked lady on the cover.
Here comes the part they had to cut out where you asked me to dinner.
Our thanks to Eric Matthews.
This is Murray L. Slaughter, in for Ted Baxter, saying so long Wait a minute.
I'd like to ask you a question, if I may.
You never said when we were gonna go to dinner.
We'll talk about that later.
- When?
- "Over dinner"?
I thought they were gonna cut that out.
We've got a new tape editor, and he's a - Little juiced.
- Right.
Hey, I've been interviewed a thousand times, and that's the first time I asked the guy interviewing me for a date.
- You got any wine vinegar?
- It's on the shelf over the stove.
Ah.
- Could you give me a hand, Mary?
- Oh, sure.
- Shall we have coffee inside?
- Inside?
Well, you see, in a one-room apartment, we call this area the inside.
- Yeah.
That must be the outside.
- No, that's the dining room.
- Cream and sugar?
- No, thanks.
I'll take it without it.
Well, how do you like 'em?
- What?
- You were looking at my shoes, no?
No, no, I wasn't.
l-I was I was looking at the floor.
Mm-hmm.
And the distance between it and my shoes.
- Really, I wasn't.
- Uh-huh.
I assure you, Mary, my feet do touch the floor whenever I walk.
- They'd almost have to, wouldn't they?
- Right!
I really have to talk to you.
It bothers you that that I'm shorter.
No, it doesn't.
You're not self-conscious about my height?
No, I'm not.
When we're together, I'm not self-conscious about your height.
I'm self-conscious about my height.
I mean, if I were an even five feet instead of five-six - Honey, you're more than five-six.
- All right, I'm five-seven.
- So, I'm 2 inches taller than you.
- You're four inches taller.
- Does it bother you?
- Does what bother me?
That you're one to four inches shorter than I am?
I learned to deal with that years ago when I played Doc in the school play.
I thought they were doing Mr. Roberts, but they were really doing Snow White.
You know, that's really fantastic to be able to kid yourself like that.
If you like the author, you'll love the book.
- The book?
- Yeah, my new manuscript.
I needed a title before I sent it to my publisher, and you gave it to me.
Toulouse-Lautrec Is One Of My Favorite Artists.
I, uh, didn't think you heard me say that.
Well, anyway, you named the book.
Now I'd like you to read it.
- You mean right now?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- You dedicated it to me.
- I thought it was appropriate.
Eric, I've never had anyone watch me read an entire book before.
- Sorry.
I'll go out and take a walk.
- Okay, that's a good idea.
You don't have to walk me to the door.
You're wasting valuable reading time.
Right.
Well, it wasn't exactly magic, was it?
- I just love - Who do you just love?
- I thought you were Eric.
- You just love Eric?
Yeah.
No.
I love his new book.
- His new book?
- Yeah, look at that.
- Mary, he dedicated it to you.
- Yeah.
- That's as good as a proposal, kid.
- Oh, come on.
How can I describe how I feel about you, my best friend, getting married?
- Rhoda, I am not - It's a mixture of envy and hostility.
But incidentally, I'm happy for you too.
- Rhoda, will you listen - Mary, you listen to me.
Now, about your reception, here's the plan.
When you throw your bouquet, fade back like you're gonna throw it to the back.
Then when the other girls move back, I'll move up quick and then you just lob it to me.
- You want to hear about Eric and me?
- Yeah, in detail.
- You know when you're dating?
- No.
You know that despite all the evidence to the contrary, - that you are really just good friends?
- Yeah.
Well, that's the way it is with Eric and me.
We are just good friends.
When you're single and 30, there are no men friends.
They're either fiances or rejects.
Eric, I can't wait to tell you what I think of this book.
Wait till I say hi to Rhoda.
Hi, Rhoda.
Tell me about the book.
It's warm, it's witty, it's funny, it's - What's the matter?
- Nothing.
I'm just trying to figure out how to get you a job as a book reviewer.
- What's the book about?
- It's all about being short.
Mary, could you be more delicate?
He's got feelings too, you know.
- No, Rhoda, that is the whole point.
- That is exactly my point.
My point is that everybody feels left out.
They're stuck with something, like shortness.
Like some people's shortness is tallness.
- What?
- Well Tell her about it, Eric.
- Did you get to the high school part?
- Not yet.
Let's talk about that high school part.
I don't like to throw this around, but I happen to be a high school graduate.
You know what I'm talking about.
Here is my theory.
Now, in every high school there is a guy who is captain of the football team.
- Yeah.
- He is also student body president.
- Yes, of course, always.
- Now he's going with this girl - Uh-huh.
- who is head cheerleader.
She's also most popular, right?
And she's also senior-class secretary, right?
- Yes.
- These two people are very happy.
Every school has two happy people, and everybody else is miserable.
- Yeah.
It's like being short, right?
- Right.
I have a confession.
When I was in school, I had a problem like shortness.
- Try and guess what it was.
- You were a fat kid.
That's close, Shorty.
Do you know what it's like for a girl to be overweight?
You know what it's like for a guy to be under height?
I got all the jobs nobody else wanted science editor of the school newspaper.
- Business manager of the yearbook.
- Ah.
What were you, Mary?
Why don't I just heat up some coffee?
- Mary?
- I'd really rather not say.
- Come on.
It can't be that bad.
- It's worse.
I was head cheerleader.
- And most popular.
- Oooh.
Eric, I'm so glad you're here.
She does this to me all the time.
She tries to make me feel guilty for having been happy in high school.
You're the first person I ever met who could handle her.
That's her Midwestern way of saying she thinks we're meant for each other.
Okay, let's see if we are.
I was assistant equipment manager for the wrestling team.
- What kind of equipment do they have?
- Very little.
I played the bass drum in the marching band.
You think that's bad?
I couldn't get a date to go to the senior prom.
- Did you get asked?
- Yes.
- Ah-ha!
- Four years after I graduated.
What did you get for a graduation gift?
- Socks.
- I got a belt buckle.
- Mary, what did you get?
- Oh, uh - What?
- A car.
Oooh.
Now, wait a minute.
It was an old car.
It was secondhand.
- One of the doors wouldn't even open.
- Did it run?
Uh, yes.
No, wait.
Hey, guys.
It was a Hudson.
- A brown Hudson.
- Oh.
And so, ladies and gentlemen, this is Murray L. Slaughter, substituting for Ted Baxter, saying good news and good night.
- I give up!
- What's the matter?
Some people are so unappreciative.
This is my last day of filling in for Ted, and nobody even bothered to call.
We had a lot of calls after your appearance with Eric Matthews.
You did?
Why didn't you tell me, Lou?
Uh, we didn't think you'd really wanna know.
Sure I wanna know, Mary.
What kind of calls did we get?
A lot of people wanted to know how your dinner date with Eric turned out.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all Yeah?
Okay, Murray, I'll turn it on.
This is Ted Baxter.
Be with me tonight at W.J.M. election headquarters when this reporter and his team of political experts are the first to predict the winner in the Minneapolis city election.
My comprehensive analysis will begin at 7:30 right after the Three Stooges.
Come in.
I can't.
I'm sorry, Mr. Grant.
- My hands were full.
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Sure.
- What did you knock with?
- With my - Uh-huh.
Mr. Grant, Murray and I dug up some facts for the election show tonight.
And we thought if you liked 'em, we could put 'em on cue cards in case Ted Baxter runs out of things to say.
Good.
Baxter usually runs out after "Good evening, ladies and gentlemen".
Sometimes after "Good evening, ladies".
Mary, when somebody does a terrific job, I believe in letting them know it.
Good work, Murray!
Mary, I want you to be in charge out there on the floor tonight.
- You want me to-to be in charge?
- Mm-hmm.
- But that's your job.
- No, it's telling you what your job is.
Look, if it's a question of extra money.
- No, it's not a question of money.
- Good, 'cause there isn't any.
Mr. Grant, you don't seem to understand.
l-l-l In order to be in charge, you have to be able to exert authority, and I've never been any good at that.
- You can do it.
- No, I can't.
You You could do it.
If I were you, right now I'd probably be saying, "Mary, I'm in a little bind right now and" I don't wanna talk about it.
You're doing it.
You see?
There it is.
That's it.
Start by telling the crew to take a half-hour dinner break.
- A half hour?
- Mm-hmm.
The way the snow's coming down, it'd be nice if everybody was back by the time they had to start.
Go tell 'em.
Mr. Grant, really, I've just never been any good at exerting authority.
- They probably won't even listen to me.
- What'd you say?
l I'll find out for you right now.
Harry, where do you want camera two?
Have him on the tote board.
- I want you on the board.
- Do you have a minute?
- Let me check Baxter's - Over here, Murray.
- No, it's okay.
Take your time.
It's fine.
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm Ted Baxter.
"Welcome to W.J.M. 's continuous election night coverage, and remember.
"We'll stay on the air until a winner is declared.
Take off glasses.
Look concerned".
- Ted said to put that in there.
- Take it out.
Come on, Murr.
Leave it in.
That's the way I remember my motivation.
I don't mind you remembering your motivation.
It just frosts me when you read it over the air like you did last night.
"Mississippi River rises.
"Thousands flee homes.
Take off glasses.
Look concerned".
I can explain that.
When I took off my glasses to look concerned, I forgot my place in the cue card.
- Hi, Mar.
- Hi, Ted.
Tom, could you take this material and put it on cue cards for Ted?
- Who okayed this material?
- I did.
- What about Lou?
- I'm sort of in charge tonight.
- You're in what?
- In charge.
That's dinner break.
Take an hour.
Could I have your attention, please?
Everybody, would you all just gather around?
- Please, could I have your attention?
- Hey, everybody.
- What's your name, honey?
- Mary.
- Mary wants your attention.
- Thank you.
I have an important announcement to make.
But first of all, I wanna thank you all for the very good work Get to the important announcement This is our dinner hour.
That is the important announcement.
We're only gonna take a half an hour for dinner tonight.
I can't eat dinner in a half hour.
Of course you can't.
It takes someone that long to cut up his food for him.
The reason we have to eat in a half hour is that it's snowing really bad out.
I can't eat a whole dinner in a half hour.
That's all there is to it.
Ted, I didn't wanna have to say this, but just a little while ago I was in Mr. Grant's Lou's office and he put me in charge of the show tonight.
So, as the person in charge of the show tonight, I'm saying that we're gonna take a half an hour for dinner.
As the anchorman of the show tonight, I say I'll just have to eat my dinner a little faster.
Let's go.
Right.
Mister - How's it going?
- Well, uh, they're not You know I, uh Mary, it's really starting to come down hard.
- What time is it now?
- You have 15 minutes to get back.
- Can I make you a cheese sandwich?
- Oh, great.
- Okay.
- I don't know what dress to wear.
I don't know what shoes I don't know what to wear.
- Why don't you wear what you got on?
- I already wore that.
Boy, I should have your job.
At least you get to dress up to go to work.
When a person dresses dummies in a store window like I do, the big deal is every Monday morning when your smock is starched.
You don't know what it's like giving orders to Ted Baxter.
Oh, is he gorgeous.
Most people on TV are so phony, but that Ted Baxter When he takes off his glasses and looks concerned, oh That guy Rhoda, can you get that for me?
I'm not dressed.
Mary, I'm making a sandwich here.
Besides, it's probably for you.
That's it.
Wear the fur dress.
Goes great with the fur shoes.
Hello?
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Oh, that is a problem.
Well No, listen, it's nobody's fault.
Sometimes no matter how many precautions you take, these things just happen.
- Who's having the baby?
- That was the employment agency.
- Our extras won't come in the blizzard.
- What were they supposed to do?
- Just answer the phones - I can answer phones.
- And look good on television.
- I can answer phones.
- You're on.
- Great.
- My cheese sandwich.
- Yeah.
Um, how is it possible to make a bad cheese sandwich?
Well, you were out of cheese, so I used yogurt.
- Five minutes to air time.
- Five minutes.
- Mimi, has the other girl shown up yet?
- Not yet.
- Everything ready, Mar?
- We still need a girl on the phones.
We need someone to run the tote board.
- The political analyst hasn't shown up.
- Uh-huh.
- Can you tell us when we wrap tonight?
- Uh, I've no idea.
- Think it'll be before 9:00?
- We'll stay till we predict a winner.
- What difference does it make?
- Well, it's not hard to understand.
I wanna go to bed early so I can get up early tomorrow so I can read the reviews about what I did tonight.
All right.
Excuse me, Ted.
I think this is Dr. Newton, our political analyst.
- Doctor?
- I'm not even a dentist.
Rhoda!
I'm sorry.
I thought you were our political analyst.
I'm glad you're here.
I gotta show you how to work that board.
Look, when the numbers come in, you get them up on the board.
Yeah.
Right on camera behind Ted Baxter?
Oh.
How's this, Mary?
Is this okay?
Yes, it's wonderful, but you have to do it in back of the board.
- You mean behind this thing?
- That's where the gadgets are.
- I'm not taking this crummy job.
- Rhoda, come on!
You're my friend.
Who else do you give crummy jobs to?
How about one of those losers over there?
You know I have trouble telling people what to do.
- You seem to be telling me pretty good.
- Rhoda, please?
All right, but this is the last time I do a favor for you, Mary Richards.
You see that headset?
Put it on.
When the numbers come in, get them up on the board.
If I'd known this was the job, I would've bought an ankle bracelet.
Stand by for air.
- Good luck, Ted.
- Thanks, Mar.
Mary, I am smiling.
When I am smiling, I am happy.
The first results are starting to come in.
Turner: 85; Mitchell: 23.
There it goes up on that tote board.
Good.
Baxter seems in good form.
Fine.
Everything's working smoothly.
Mary, when someone does a terrific job, I believe in letting them know it.
You're doing a What was that?
What's wrong with the lights?
The Teletype stopped.
It can't stop.
If it stops, we don't get votes.
It stopped.
We don't get votes.
The storm must've knocked the lines down.
At least we have people at the precinct to phone the votes in.
Hello?
Hello?
- Stand by.
- Hey.
- Action!
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
It's 7:30.
The polls are closed.
And I'm Ted Baxter.
Welcome to W.J.M.'s continuous election night coverage.
We'll be on the air with returns until a winner is declared.
We're in for an exciting evening here at W.J.M. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, for those of you that have tuned in late, we've been on the air for two hours now, and the up-to-the-hour totals.
Turner: 85,; Mitchell: 23.
And the tension is mounting.
Oh, a commercial.
Good.
We'll be back with more results, I hope, right after this commercial.
And cut!
I can't take it anymore!
Two hours of 85-23, 85-23?
I need new numbers.
I can't ad-lib anymore.
- But, Ted, your ad-libbing is great.
- Really?
Really.
Yes, just fine.
Fine.
A couple of small points, hardly worth mentioning, but do you think it's right on the election show to do impressions of Humphrey Bogart?
That's all you know.
I was doing Jimmy Cagney.
I'm not going back out there alone.
- Has the political analyst arrived yet?
- No.
I'm going back out there alone.
I'll never make it.
Look, Ted, I'm positive the phone lines are gonna be repaired soon.
In the meantime, we're all counting on you to pull us through.
Thirty seconds.
Stand by.
- Ted, you're gonna be just fine.
- Why do we have to go back on the air?
Why don't we rerun last year's elections?
At least last year's elections, the numbers changed.
Not like Turner: 85; Mitchell: 23 Turner: 108; Mitchell: 61.
Like that.
Turner: 112,; Mitchell: 74.
- The board's working.
- Don't stop me now.
I'm rolling.
- Turner: 136,; Mitchell: 114.
- Hold it.
Hold it just a Rhoda, you're leaning on the switch.
Hi, Mary.
Nice guy.
He's the floor manager, whatever that is.
Do you have to do that at a time like this?
You know what it's like all alone behind that board?
- It was Turner: 85 - Mitchell: 23.
I know.
- Rhoda, please, get back there.
- Okay, okay.
Ted, I'm sorry.
Rhoda made a mistake.
These are the wrong numbers.
Stand by, everybody.
What's wrong is I'm standing here and he's gonna throw his finger at me, and I'm gonna have to say, "Welcome back to election headquarters".
It's still Turner: 85; Mitchell: 23.
A definite trend is being set.
Turner's lead seems to be holding quite steady.
And the excitement is just beginning.
Meanwhile, let's have a look at some of the other hotly-contested issues.
For example, the controversial Proposition "A" seems to be shaping up as quite a cliffhanger.
Right now the figures are zero to zero.
Have you ever wondered what the letters W.J.M. stood for?
Well, I certainly have.
And so, in 1951, W.J.M. was granted a license by the F.C.C. Have you ever wondered what the letters F.C.C. stand for?
That man is dying out there.
He's read everything in the studio, including his driver's license.
What we need are votes to talk about.
What's happening with the phone company?
- I sent a man over there.
- And?
He's missing.
So I sent another man to look for the first man.
- Don't tell me.
- Yes.
I'd like to send another man, but it's getting harder to find volunteers.
Maybe we ought to send Baxter.
No, no, no.
With our luck, he'd be the only one to make it back.
Mr. Grant, why don't we just rerun an old movie until everything gets fixed?
That's a good question for someone who doesn't know anything about this business.
We sold our election night coverage to sponsors.
They don't have to pay us unless we give them election night coverage.
So, unless there's a movie called Election Night Coverage Lou, Ted ran out of things to say.
What?
He ran out of things to say three hours ago.
- This time it's different.
- What?
- Turn on the sound, Mary.
- The sound is on.
Oh, this is different.
- What's he doing out there?
- Breathing.
I don't believe I've ever seen that before.
- Murray, get into commercial fast.
- Right.
That settles it.
There are votes out there, and I'm gonna bring 'em here.
Mario, get the mobile unit gassed up, check the chains.
I'm taking it out.
- No!
- What do you mean, no?
- No, don't go.
- I didn't say no I said yes.
- Yes, I'm still going.
- Mr. Grant, please don't go.
If you go, who's gonna be in charge?
Same person who's been in charge you.
They only let me be in charge because they knew you were here to be in charge.
Why don't you stay and let me go get the votes?
- I can't let you go out in that snow.
- Why?
I'm good in the snow.
I drive very carefully.
I've driven in it before.
- You really think you can?
- Of course I can.
The mobile unit has automatic transmission, doesn't it?
Four on the floor, double clutch, compound low, four-wheel drive and a hydraulic shovel.
- I can learn.
- Look, Mary.
I hate to tell you this, but the mobile unit is a truck.
A big truck.
- A big one.
- I can still learn.
It's It's something It's-It's like an "H," right?
It's more like an "H" with a "W" in the middle of it and a "T" on the side.
I'm sorry, Mary.
You're still in charge.
- And will you stop looking like that.
- Like what?
Like that.
Like a poster for Radio Free Europe.
Well, l I suddenly just feel so lonely.
Turn on the TV.
That's always good company.
Add the yolks of three eggs, half a cup of walnuts Makes a wonderful late-night snack.
He's doing recipes?
I'll hurry.
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's still Turner: 85; Mitchell: 23.
But I'm sure our phone lines will be repaired soon and we'll have some new results.
With luck, maybe right after this next commercial.
And cut!
Ted, are you all right?
You you're doing this to me.
I'm gonna find you some help.
Murray, he needs somebody to talk to.
Don't look at me.
I don't even talk to him at parties.
Who we gonna get?
What about him?
He's already in makeup.
Thank heaven.
That must be the political analyst.
- Doctor?
- Father.
- Doctor Father?
- Father Flint.
Well, I'm very pleased to meet you.
I wasn't expecting to meet a priest.
It's my turn to do sermonette.
Oh.
Father, we're having a little trouble here.
I know, I know.
I haven't seen a man suffer like that since Job.
- Would you consider going on with him?
- I'd be delighted.
- I've always wanted to do a talk show.
- Thank you, Father.
Ted, we've got some help.
What's he doing here?
Do I look that bad?
Relax, my dear boy.
You're going to be all right.
Where's my close-up camera?
Am I on my mark here?
In the chair, Father.
Coming out of commercial.
Stand by.
Good luck, Ted.
It's gonna be fine.
And, Father, thank you.
Stand by!
Action!
Back again, ladies and gentlemen.
We're fortunate to have an old friend drop by to say hello while our phone lines are being repaired.
I'd like you to meet Father Father - What's your name?
- Father Flint.
Father Flint.
Tell me, Padre Now that you're here, I'm sure our viewers would like to know.
How long have you been interested in religion?
Did you hear the one about the minister and the rabbi and the priest who all decided to play golf one election day?
Yes, Father, about a half hour ago.
I see it's time for another commercial.
Oh, oh.
Ted and I will be right back after this important message.
And cut!
It's going just fine, Ted.
Really fine.
I think you're gonna have to find someone to take Father Flint's place.
Poor man.
He seemed to have lost a lot of his wind after they sang "Danny Boy".
Listen, everybody.
Channel 3 just predicted Turner a winner and signed off!
All we have to do is declare Turner a winner, and we can all go home.
- No, hold it.
Hold it just a minute.
- What was that?
That was, "Hold it just a minute".
We can't go on with that information.
It's not official.
- It's official enough for me.
- Murray, no.
We have an obligation.
Mary, all those people out there are sleeping.
I feel no obligation to sleeping people.
Well, I'm sure at least Turner and Mitchell aren't sleeping.
It wouldn't be right.
It would be dishonest.
- Who is she?
- Who are you anyway?
Rhoda, I feel very strongly about this.
It would be wrong.
It wouldn't be so bad.
- Hey, what more do you need?
- Coming out of commercial.
Stand by.
I am going to declare a winner now.
Ted, Ted, look.
I know you're dead tired and you wanna go home.
We all wanna go home, but I cannot let you make this announcement.
I'm going to declare a winner now.
Ted, if you declare a winner now, you're fired.
Stand by, everybody!
And action!
Welcome back, gentlemen ladies.
It looks like Turner: 85; Mitchell: 23.
And we'll stay right here until we get all the facts to declare a winner.
Oh, I see Gordie the weatherman just stopped in to say hello.
He's gonna tell us all about what makes it snow right after this commercial.
And cut!
Congratulations, kid.
How'd you do it?
I don't know.
I just opened my mouth, and "you're fired" just came out.
I guess I'm not so bad at being in charge after all.
Say, Rhoda, aren't you supposed to be in back of that board right now?
I don't feel like it.
Oh, Tom, I wonder, could I talk to you Later.
I'm busy.
But I'm supposed to be in charge.
And so I decided to pack my bags and leave New York City and come here to Minneapolis.
People ask me, "Why Minneapolis"?
And I replied, "Why not"?
Oh, I see it's time for a commercial.
Ted and I will be right back after this brief message.
And cut!
And what did you do after you got to Minneapolis?
- Ted, we're off the air.
- Oh, are we?
- Yeah.
- Would you lead me to the water?
I think I'm thirsty.
Of course.
Steady now.
Come on.
Hi.
Hey, what's going on here?
Say, aren't you Are you Chuckles the Clown?
No, no, I'm Walter Cronkite.
- How did you get through the snowstorm?
- I took the bus.
It quit snowing about an hour ago.
Listen.
How come you're still on the air?
I have to go on in half an hour.
- We're waiting for the returns.
- Haven't you heard?
- We haven't heard anything.
- Oh, for crying out loud.
"Mitchell wins it.
Turner concedes".
- Turner - Mitchell won it, not Turner.
- Mm-hmm.
- Chuckles, listen.
Ted is not really in any condition to go on.
Would you go on and announce the winner so we can all go home?
Chuck-a-luck-a-bunky-wuck!
Would I ever!
Just point Mr. Camera at me.
Coming out of commercial.
And action!
Hi, boys and girls!
Our new mayor is Mr. Mitchell!
So let's all give him a really colossal Chuckles the Clown Club cheer!
Chuck-a-luck!
Chuck-a-luck!
Chuck-a-luck-luck-luck-luck-a-chuck!
Luck-a-chuck!
Luck-chuck-chuck!
Mary, when I put somebody in charge, I never second-guess 'em.
That's my policy.
So I'm never gonna ask you why you put Ted Baxter in a clown suit.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all Tomorrow the weather will be clear.
And now, to top off this edition of the 6:00 News.
My story.
A lady in Philadelphia lost her dog.
She went to the pound and found it.
Once she got home, she found she had the wrong dog.
The woman, who didn't know one dog from another, was a vegetarian.
Veterinarian!
That's probably somebody calling to ask us to explain what Ted just said.
Newsroom.
Oh, hi, Rhoda.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I got hung up here.
Did you think of a movie for us to see?
No, don't pick me up.
I wanna come home first.
I'll try to think of a movie.
- Bye-bye.
- Go see the new John Wayne picture.
- Is it good?
- They're all good.
I never miss a one.
Why's that, Lou?
Do you identify with John Wayne?
That's it.
Wayne gets teed off at somebody, he hits him or shoots him.
I get teed off at somebody, all I can do is write a memo.
Like this one!
But, Lou You wanna see a good movie?
See Son of Flubber.
You can't go wrong with a Disney movie.
- Know what my favorite Disney movie is?
- Snow White?
Right!
Hey, who can name all seven dwarfs?
I can.
Lou, how about you?
Murr?
- Lou, you wanna grab a hamburger?
- No.
I don't eat meat.
I'm a veterinarian.
Rhoda!
What are you doing here?
I got tired of waiting up in my place, so I came down here.
Listen, I'm sorry I'm late.
What's the matter with your leg?
This is the lotus position, a yoga exercise.
It helps a person achieve an inner peace.
It'll just take me a minute to change.
Rhoda, aren't both legs supposed to be up when you're in the lotus position?
Only fanatics use both legs.
- Hey, can you get that?
- Huh?
Oh, sure.
Hey, Mary, I can't, hon!
Aah!
Hello?
Phyllis, hang on a second.
Fanatic.
Yeah, Phyllis?
Well, I tell you, I was just about to go out to a Well, all right, I'll wait.
Bye.
I knew I should've met you at work.
Don't tell her we're going to the movies or she'll want to come along.
- And you'll let her.
- She sounded kind of frantic.
Sure.
She's frantic we might go to a movie without her.
Oh - Hi, Phyllis.
- Something's come up.
I wondered if you could take care of Bess for a few days.
- Oh?
What is it?
- It's Lars, Mary.
He's contracted a case of varicella from one of his patients.
Varicella?
What's that?
Lars is in the incubation period, and I'm immune, so Chicken pox!
That's what that quack's got!
Chicken pox!
I really wouldn't ask you if it weren't an emergency, Mary.
You said varicella, but it's plain old, mundane chicken pox.
- Rhoda, would you please - A kid's disease!
Rhoda, please!
Phyllis, don't misunderstand this.
Are you sure that Bess wants to stay with me?
She's not crazy about me.
Mary, it's time Bess found out that life is no bed of roses.
Milk, butter, jelly - Hi.
- Bess'll be up in a second.
These are the books.
- The books?
- Yeah, on creative child-rearing.
I know some people find it amusing that I insist on raising Bess from these, but the men and women who wrote them are experts, and the people who laugh aren't.
Besides, Bess thinks these books show a lot of insight.
Bess has read these?
- Yes.
Why?
Does that surprise you?
- Well, yeah.
- She's just a little girl.
- Wrong.
"She's just a little girl"?
Uh, chapter six.
"The adult who says of a child 'She's just a little girl' is clearly showing her ignorance".
Well, what do I know?
She's going to be here in a second, so I ought to prepare you for something.
- Oh?
What?
- Something she does when she's angry.
- I ignore it.
I wish you would too.
- W- What?
Mother's coming, Bess.
No, Mother is not coming until Mary finds out what it is that Bess does.
She wears my wig and makeup.
Mary will be doing the very best she can, Bess.
We can't expect too much of her.
Remember, Mother and Father love their Bess.
And Mary likes her.
Well, here we are.
Uh, have you had dinner?
Yes.
Phyllis burned it.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Why?
You didn't burn it.
- Well, no.
It's just when you try something and it doesn't turn out, it's disappointing.
Well, it doesn't bother Phyllis.
Do you always call your mother Phyllis?
It's her name.
Yeah, I know, but when I was a little girl w- when I was a young person, I, uh, I always called my mother Mother.
I still do.
I mean, I never even think of calling her Marge!
That's what it is.
It's Marge.
Did Phyllis show you these books?
Uh, yeah.
I haven't had a chance to really get into 'em yet.
Well, I think you ought to.
This isn't going particularly well so far.
No.
Uh, do you like having all that makeup on your face?
- Yes.
Do you?
- I think it makes you look awful.
Uh Bess?
Uh, Bess, what are you what are you doing?
- Mary?
- Aah!
Bess forgot this.
She likes her milk in it.
How's everything going so far?
Don't answer.
I know everything's great.
Where is she?
- Well, uh, she's, uh - Locked herself in the bathroom, huh?
Well, yes.
You said something without looking in the book first.
- Well, yes.
- What did you say?
Uh, well, I told her I thought the makeup looked awful.
- And now you're trying to get her out.
- Yes.
Could you help me?
- Of course I'm going to help you.
- Good.
Here.
Chapter eight.
"Right of Privacy".
Uh, Bess, "l-I respect your right of privacy.
I don't mind your locking the door".
Uh, r-really, l-I don't.
And, um "I am always eager to participate in a free and open discussion of whatever it is that's bothering you".
Really.
Really, l-I am.
You might have to burn your washcloth.
It's got gunk all over it.
I recognize those quotes.
They're right from the books, aren't they?
Uh, well, yeah, they are.
Hey, what do you say we forget the books and talk about what fun we can have tomorrow?
How about that?
I'm not working.
You and I could go shopping.
- What for?
- Nothing.
You don't have to buy anything when you shop.
And that's kinda nice, because if you know you're not gonna buy anything, you don't have to wonder whether or not you can afford it.
What can I do for you now, Aunt Mary?
- Why don't you go get the mail.
- Okay.
I'll get it!
Hi, Aunt Rhoda!
I'm going to get the mail.
But if you haven't had breakfast yet, set a place for yourself.
Who was that nice, short little person?
That's my roomie.
I can't believe it, Mary.
What happened?
You know something?
She's really just a nice little just a nice little girl.
- How?
- How what?
- Did you do it?
- I didn't do anything.
Well, all right, maybe I did.
Hey, Rhoda, have you ever wondered what kind of mother you'd be?
I don't care, as long as it's not unwed.
Well, I've always wondered.
And you know what?
I think I'm gonna be fantastic!
- Don't you think?
- I think you threatened her life.
- Oh - Morning, all!
- Hi.
- Everything is beautiful.
Guess what.
Lars was in error when he thought he had varicella.
Chicken pox!
All he has is Rhus diversiloba.
- Translation, please.
- Poison oak.
Hi, Phyllis!
Get your things, dear.
Mother's here to take you home.
I don't want to go home.
- What?
- I don't want to go home.
Ohh!
She doesn't mean that.
As soon as you get her home Oh, no, no, no, I wouldn't force her, Mary.
We encourage her independence.
If this is where she wants to be This is where you want to be, is it, Bess?
- Uh, but, Phyllis - No, no, Mary, you don't understand.
If Bess wants this This is what you want, Bess?
Well, it's obviously her wish to stay here.
Is it your wish, Bess?
Then this is where she'll stay.
Oh, hi, Mary.
Come in, love.
Uh, Phyllis, listen, I just feel awful about this.
About what?
Well, about what Bess said.
I mean, I think she meant she just wanted to stay with me for breakfast.
Oh, no.
She meant she wanted to stay with you forever.
No, Phyllis, I'm sure she didn't.
Oh, but she did, love.
You're gay and young and unencumbered.
Not like me, the old drudge who cooks her meals, mends her tattered clothes.
- Of course she wants to stay with you.
- No, she doesn't!
But she does, dear.
For now.
Maybe in a week or two she'll become bored.
Not with you, of course.
Maybe less than a week.
Honestly, Phyllis, I don't know how you can be so calm about this.
I mean, if my daughter Should you ever be so fortunate as to become a wife and then mother a child like my Bess.
- Trust me, Mary.
- Well, okay.
l But, boy, Phyllis, I really Trust me.
All right, all right.
Oh, uh, Phyllis, l I hate to ask this.
- I've never had to ask the question.
- Ask anything.
Uh, Phyllis, I've got a date tonight.
Could you baby-sit?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Ted Baxter with the 6:00 News.
So far, so good.
It was disclosed today that Deputy Defense Minister 'Nay-guy-en' Banwat" - Nguyen Banwat.
- Nguyen Banwat.
- " Met last week with 'Lanole' - Lon Nol!
at a top secret enclave near Phno Phnom Penh".
Whatever happened to the good old days when they had wars in England?
You'd find a way to mispronounce "London".
Mr. Grant asked me to remind you it's Richard Milhouse Nixon, not "Milhorse".
- Hi!
- Bess, hi.
What are you doing here?
I thought I'd meet you and go home with you.
Well, okay, but it's very busy, so you just sit over here and stay put, huh?
- Uh, Ted, this is Bess.
- Hi, Bess.
Hi.
You're the anchorman, aren't you?
Nice child.
Mary, we've got film on the Florida bank robbery.
Put another lead on an idiot card for Ted.
They're cue cards, Lou.
I don't know why everyone feels compelled to call cue cards idiot cards.
We just have trouble thinking of you as a cue.
Mary!
Mar - Have I got an appointment with you?
- Uh-uh.
- Then what are you doing there?
- I'm waiting.
We're all waitin', kid.
Did you forget that lead on the diet pills?
Yeah, I got it.
I have an idea for you while you're waiting.
Draw a picture.
- I can't draw anything but flowers.
- Well, then draw flowers.
I'm so tired of drawing flowers.
I've been drawing them since I was four.
Ah, well, then look.
A horse is easy.
Say, Mary, that's a nice horsie.
Thank you, Ted.
Mary, where are the idiot cards?
Cue cards, Lou, please.
Cue cards.
Excuse me, Ted.
Mary, would you please give those cue cards to this idiot?
- What's that?
- A horsie!
That's nice.
That's nice, Teddy.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm waiting for Mary.
- You want something to do?
- Uh-huh.
Do you like to recite in school?
- Yeah.
- Okay, repeat after me.
- Nguyen Banwat.
- Nguyen Banwat.
- Phnom Penh.
- Phnom Penh.
- Richard Milhouse Nixon.
- Richard Milhouse Nixon.
Good.
How'd you like to be the anchorkid?
But for now, make some notes about the newsroom and write a composition for school.
- Okay.
- Good girl.
Murray, see if you can do this in five lines or less.
- What's your name, please?
- Lou.
- What do you do here?
- I'm the boss.
Thank you.
Mary!
- How's it going?
- Fine.
- Yes, sir?
- Who's the kid?
- Well, that's kind of a long story.
- How can it be a long story?
I say, "Who's the kid"?
You say, "SallyJones".
Who's the kid?
- Bess.
- That wasn't too long.
She's the daughter of my downstairs neighbors.
But now she's staying with me and, uh You may not have noticed, but I never cuss when there are kids in the newsroom.
Yes, I noticed.
I want you to know I appreciate your watching your language.
I don't like to watch my language.
I don't like having kids in the newsroom.
I mean, I'd like to cuss right now because that kid's out there.
But I can't cuss because that kid's out there.
Do I make myself clear?
I think so.
You'd like to cuss.
Is that it?
Yes!
Very much.
Oh, well, then, uh, I'll get her out of there.
Good!
I feel a cuss coming on.
This is too good to waste.
Send Ted Baxter in here.
Boy, I really like where you work, Mary.
It sure is a lot of fun.
What do we do tonight?
Well, uh, we could talk about what we're gonna have for dinner.
What about TV dinners?
- We don't have any.
- But I could go out and get some.
That'll give you some time to figure out whatever's got you so uptight.
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.
- I'll walk slow.
- Okay.
- And charge it to my account.
- Okay.
- Hi, Aunt Rhoda.
- Hi, kid.
Hey, Mary, I know you still have this thing to straighten out with Phyllis, but I've got a problem.
It's sort of pressing.
I need $40 to pay a fine or I'll get arrested.
- A traffic fine?
- No.
I fed a buffalo.
Yeah, sure you did, Rhoda.
Really!
I went to the zoo on my lunch hour.
Anyway, you know I've always been a sucker for buffaloes.
You know those signs that say, "Don't feed the buffalo"?
I fed the buffalo.
They really fine you for that, if they catch you.
- Rhoda, what did you feed him?
- Low-fat prune yogurt.
You know something, Mary?
That buffalo's gonna have some nice figure.
- Can you spare the 40?
- Yeah, I think I can.
- What's happening with dizzy Phyllis?
- Nothing.
She's still trying to act as though nothing was wrong.
And I just don't know how to get through to her.
- I'm gonna have to, though, aren't I?
- Yeah.
It's either that or start saving up to put the kid through college.
- In addition to paying for my buffalo.
- Yes.
I'll write you a check.
I couldn't look at you, knowing how you feel, and take money from you.
I'll pick it up later.
I brought Bess a little cabbage soup.
No offense.
I know you're a wonderful cook and you're feeding her well.
- Where is she?
- Uh, she's out buying TV dinners.
Oh.
Well, I just dropped by to see what time you wanted me to baby-sit tonight.
Phyllis, sit down, will you.
I was, uh, just calling you to tell you that, uh, I think everything is kinda crazy around here, and it's gonna get even crazier if you don't do something.
- What's your problem, Mary?
- It's not my problem, Phyllis.
It's yours.
Bess.
We've been all over that.
It's just a phase Bess is in.
I think Bess would want to come home if you'd just show her you miss her.
Why don't you come right out and say it?
You think I'm a lousy mother.
No, I don't, Phyllis.
I'll tell you exactly what I think.
I think l What are you trying to say?
I'm trying to think of a nice way to say that I think you're a lousy mother.
Well, Miss Daughter-Snatcher, let me tell you something.
I have read all the books and I feel that l-I'm What are you doing wearing my love beads?
Bess made these for me.
Can you beat that?
She's made you the same beads she made for me.
She loves you.
She wants you to be her mother.
Oh, Phyllis - W- What is it?
- Bess.
She saw me crying.
- She'll hate me for being weak.
- Hate you?
Oh, Phyllis, listen.
Look, you and I have been good friends for a long time, right?
Well, not so good as you think.
I mean, it's because you come on so darn strong all the time.
Well, I like you so much better when you come on weak.
And if I feel this way, imagine how Bess felt when she saw you just now.
Well, why imagine?
I'm gonna go get her.
- Mary?
- Yeah?
Should I keep crying?
It wouldn't hurt.
Phyllis, do you know where Mary left a check for me?
I got fined for feeding a buffalo.
Oh, well, look, there's no need to get that upset.
It's all taken care of.
You're an incredibly sympathetic person!
Do you know that?
My goodness.
I'd better get outta here.
I think I'm depressing you.
If the zoo was half as sympathetic as you are, I wouldn't need the 40 bucks.
Mary, whatever you do, don't mention the buffalo.
Phyllis, Bess went home.
- Home?
- Home.
I just talked to her.
You know what she said?
Well, it was just so touching.
She looked up at me and she said, "Uh-huh".
She said, "Uh-huh"?
I don't know what that means, Mary.
Well, you had to be there.
She said "Uh-huh" after I said, "Bess, are you here because you know your mother needs you"?
And she said, "Uh-huh"?
Uh-huh!
Oh, Mary, this isn't much, but thank you.
You're gonna make a wonderful mother.
I know.
Oh.
Oh, isn't this silence lovely?
Mary, I love movies, but not the kiddie show at 10:00 a.m. on a Saturday.
Yeah, but Bess wanted to treat us, so how could we refuse?
Anyway, it was so nice seeing Phyllis and Bess laughing together.
I see what you're getting at.
Phyllis and Bess laughing together.
The world has a nice, big, pink Mary Richards bow around it.
Is that it?
Well, yeah.
Something like that.
Let me tell you something.
That Phyllis is still a crazy lady.
She's wacko.
She's taking that kid to the movies again tonight.
So?
That's great.
They're going to see Myra Breckinridge.
Ohh!
I'm kidding.
Anybody would know I'm kidding.
But not you.
You believe everything.
Mary, you're the most gullible person I ever met.
They don't call you Rhoda the kidder for nothing.
You are gullible.
- I am not.
I was kidding you.
- You were not.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all No, Phyllis, I can talk.
It's been really quiet around here today.
Mary, get a camera crew downtown right away!
Just this minute.
Phyllis, I'll call you back.
Mr. Grant, we don't have a camera crew available.
One is covering the prison riot, and I can't locate the other one.
The biggest story of the week breaks, and we're doing a prison riot?
- What's the story?
- There's a major traffic jam!
A major traffic Mr. Grant, why is a traffic jam more important than the prison riot?
You are so lucky.
I am going to tell you everything I know about news.
- It's worth taking notes.
- Oh.
Don't take notes.
Why is a traffic jam more important than a prison riot, hmm?
- How many people are in a prison riot?
- Offhand?
- How many?
- Fifty.
- How many in a traffic jam?
- Oh, I see.
No, you don't.
Those in the traffic jam will go home and watch the news, right?
Guys in the prison riot aren't gonna be watching the news.
They're either gonna be over the wall or in solitary.
- Did you learn something?
- I'll find that other crew.
- Is this Mr. Grant's office?
- Yes, it is.
I'm an old friend of Lou Grant's.
My name's Frank Carelli.
- Just a minute, Mr. Carelli.
- Frank.
Frank.
Prison, would you give me the warden's office, please?
Thank you.
Yes, can you tell me where the riot is today?
Oh.
Well, as you were taking over the office, did you happen to notice a W.J.M. TV crew Hello?
Kind of a crisis situation has arisen.
Mr. Grant won't be too much longer.
- I got it solved for you, Lou.
- How?
I dug up this film of a 1952 traffic jam.
All traffic jams look alike.
That solution could cost us our license, Murray.
We can't put on a 1952 traffic jam as the one we're having today.
- The FCC takes a dim view of that.
- Read my lead.
"Today's traffic tie-up was the worst since 1952, which you'll all remember looked like this".
Murray, I love you.
Get it to Ted.
Mr. Grant.
Mr. Carelli is here to see you.
Frank!
How goes it?
Long time, no see.
- I didn't know you'd recognize me.
- Are you kidding?
Hey, everybody, I want you to come over and say hello to Frank Burelli.
Carelli.
Uh, Frank's one of the greatest guards that ever played pro ball.
Thanks, but I was only second string.
Hey, listen.
I'd like to stay around and chew the fat with you, but you caught me at a very bad time.
Why don't you tell the guys what it felt like to play on a championship team.
Well, I don't know They won the title the year after I retired.
I guess it'd feel great.
- Well, what are you doing now, Frank?
- I'm in insurance.
I've gotta fill my stapler.
Great meeting you, Frank.
- Guess it's just one of those days.
- Yeah, guess so.
I don't suppose you'd be interested in buying some insurance?
Well, I don't think so, no.
Uh, of course, we could talk about it sometime.
- Yeah?
When?
How 'bout tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow?
- What's your address?
- 119 North - I don't have a pencil.
- Oh.
Here.
- 119 North Wetherley.
- North Wetherley.
Great I shall see you tomorrow at 8:00.
- At 8:00.
- Right.
Yoo-hoo.
- Come in.
- Hi!
I'll just be a minute.
Uh, that's not likely to help, Rhoda.
- What?
- No, I'm just kidding.
- Actually, you never looked better.
- Very funny, Phyllis.
Mary, I'd like to give you a chance to atone for hanging up on me today and do a service for mankind at the same time.
She already did a service for mankind by hanging up on you.
How would you How would you both like to help abolish capital punishment?
Phyllis, there's no capital punishment in this state.
Well, that was easy.
Well, we can't give up the fight just because we've won.
All right, what is it you want us to do?
Well, we're having our annual dinner dance next month.
You have a dance to abolish capital punishment?
Well, it's not all frivolous.
We do have an electric chair on display.
How do you feel if you're dancing and the lights flicker?
- Ouch!
- That's all right, Rhoda.
Kid about it.
I understand.
It's because the subject makes you nervous.
Even we pros have a tendency to joke about it.
Why, only this afternoon, a girl told us a joke that broke us up.
You'll appreciate this, Rhoda.
You know what the definition of a guillotine operator is?
- I'm afraid to guess.
- A guillotine operator is a man who can keep his head when all others around him are losing theirs.
Shoot.
- Are you expecting company, Mar?
- No, I wasn't.
Hi!
I was playing with some kids in the park, but I remembered our appointment.
So I hurried back to my place, picked up the old briefcase and here I am.
Ladies.
- Hope I'm not late.
- Actually, you're about 23 hours early.
- It was supposed to be tomorrow?
- Right.
Boy, am I dumb.
Well, listen.
As long as you're here, Phyllis, Rhoda, I'd like you to meet Frank Carelli.
He's gonna show me some life insurance plans.
Why don't you sit down?
- I'll get you some coffee.
- Could I have some milk instead?
- Milk, sure.
- Life insurance, huh?
Well, that leaves me out.
I still haven't met a beneficiary.
My husband and I are into "cryonetics".
- So, we don't need any insurance.
- What's that?
When Lars and I, uh, go, uh, we will be frozen.
Then, of course, when they discover a cure for whatever it is that made us, uh, go, we will be defrosted.
Hey, I think we could work out a plan where you wouldn't have to pay the premiums while you're on ice.
Good thinking.
Frank, how would you like to serve humanity by stoping capital punishment, and all you have to do is buy a chance?
- Yeah, a chance, sure.
- You can win an antique guillotine.
- Just what you've always wanted.
- For that useless wall over there.
- That'll be ten dollars.
- Ten dollars?
Oh, well, here you go two fives.
Thank you, Frank.
I must run, Mary.
Here, pin this on his snowsuit.
It shows he gave.
It looks like a little man with a noose around his neck.
It is.
When you move it, his little tongue and eyes pop out.
I gotta go.
Don't rise.
Let me give you some advice, Frank.
Don't wear that if you wanna sell much life insurance.
- Thanks for the haircut, Mary.
- You're welcome.
Well, I better show you one of our whole life plans, huh?
- Ooh.
Is this a picture of you, Frank?
- Huh?
Oh, gee, I must've grabbed that by mistake.
You see, that's sort of my scrapbook.
One thing's for sure.
You're never gonna get a hernia lifting my scrapbook.
You know, that's one of our old locker room jokes.
No offense meant, ma'am.
No, there's nothing quite like an old locker room.
- This is a nice picture of you.
- Thanks.
That's my bubble gum card.
Hey, I don't think I've ever met anyone who was on a bubble gum card before.
There's some information about me on the back.
Look at all the places you've played - Los Angeles, Dallas, Minnesota.
- Mm-hmm.
If I'd have been on the first string, I could have owned a restaurant.
- Is that what you really wanted to do?
- It beats hustling insurance.
Owning a restaurant's a good career.
Or Colts: 21; Lions: 14.
San Francisco: zero; Chicago: 22.
- How was I?
- It depends on what you were doing.
Sportscasting.
I'll be honest with you, Mary.
That's what I really wanted to talk to Lou Grant about.
I heard there was a job for a sportscaster that was opening.
Yeah, I think there is.
How 'bout it?
Do you think you could get me a crack at it?
You don't need me.
Mr. Grant's gonna have open auditions for the job.
- It never hurts to have contacts.
- Yeah, but in this case - You need a contact to get anywhere.
- But I don't think - Will you be my contact?
- But l - Will you be my contact?
- I'll be your contact.
Mr. Grant, has the sportscaster's job been filled yet?
Nope, but it won't be open for long.
Everybody in the state wants that job.
And why not?
All you have to do is stand in front of a camera, read the scores for two and a half minutes and collect 20 grand a year.
I'm trying to figure out how I can throw the job to my wife.
- You think Frank might be good?
- No.
But what if he came in and auditioned and, I mean, really knocked you right out?
- What if he was terrific?
- You know, that's not a bad idea.
- You mean seeing Frank Carelli?
- No, my wife.
If I put her in a sports jacket, pull her hair back.
- Tell Frank he can audition.
- Yeah?
Hi!
Bet you didn't expect to see me today.
No, I didn't.
What are you doing down there?
- Plugging in my tape recorder.
- Ooh!
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah.
It's been hit a lot harder.
- Hey, wanna hear my book?
- Hear your book?
Yeah, it's something I started my last year in training camp.
A lot of the fellas are doing it.
Sort of a diary on tape.
Then they get some author to come in and turn it into a book.
I never finished mine, though.
It shouldn't be a total loss.
You can get to hear my speaking style.
- Mr. Grant says you can audition.
- That's terrific.
Thanks.
You see what a contact can do?
Okay, now listen to this.
- Testing.
One, two, three.
Testing.
- It gets better.
My Life on the Gridiron, by Frank Carelli.
This book is dedicated to my wonderful teammates the '65 Rams, the '66 Cowboys and the '67 Vikings.
- Very interesting.
- Wait.
I'm just rolling now.
Listen.
Page one July 20.
First day of training today.
We did a lot of exercises and ran up and down the field.
I must be getting old.
We got a saying on the locker room wall "Out of shape, out of breath, out of the championship.
" .
July 21.
Head Coach Lucas yelled at me today.
Especially when my man got by me a couple of times.
He's a rookie, but pretty quick.
And the defense keeps blitzing, and I'm really beat.
Well, it's lights out.
- What does "blitzing" mean?
- I don't know.
Sounds terrible, though.
Come on.
You must know, Mary.
I like you, but you must have been a cheerleader in high school.
- I was not a cheerleader.
- No kidding?
I was a pom-pom girl.
I was on the drum and bugle corps.
August 6 Billy Jackson, our halfback made 8,000 bucks today for endorsing a hair cream.
They could've got me for a couple hundred.
I guess nobody cares what hair cream I use.
I usually buy the one that's on sale.
Mary, I don't know a thing about sportscasting, but I'm an expert on bad.
Accept it.
You can't do anything for this guy.
Listen, thanks for dinner.
I'll see you tomorrow.
September 9.
Thirty-seventh day of training.
That Coach Lucas screamed in my ear today like a maniac.
Called me a lazy old man.
- It's just so I'll play better.
- Frank?
Coach wants you to see you.
Bring your playbook.
My playbook?
Mary, I know what you're thinking, but you can't help everybody.
Well, I turned in my playbook.
This time they couldn't even trade me.
I'm off the team.
I got cut.
What am I feeling bad about?
It's time I got into something else.
There's probably plenty of other things I can doplenty of other things.
I just don't know what they are yet.
That's all.
Mary, why aren't you helping this man?
- Anything interesting, Mar?
- Well, a couple of bills.
An ad for a correspondence course.
- Oh, yeah?
For what?
- The Famous Plumbers School.
The Famous Plumbers?
I get on some weird mailing list every once in a while.
- Make way for the master chef.
- Hi.
What's the occasion?
You girls have been so nice, I thought I'd come here and cook you dinner.
- You cook?
- Do I cook?
- I'm Italian, aren't I?
- Hey, that's great.
I love Italian food.
What are you cooking?
Steaks.
- Uh-huh.
- What?
A man is pretty serious when he starts cooking dinner.
- Rhoda, that's silly.
- Serious.
This isn't just gratitude.
- He's after one of us.
- Rhoda, you're being ridiculous.
Do you think so?
You pom-pom girls always wind up with football players.
Mary, where do you keep your meat pounder?
- My meat pounder?
- Oh, yeah.
I should have known.
What would a classy lady like you be doing with a meat pounder?
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs to get my meat pounder.
Can I help?
Huh?
Oh, no.
You relax.
You worked today.
- Well, so did you.
- No, I didn't.
Every time I go out to sell insurance, my stomach gets all upset and I think that I'm bothering people.
That's why sportscasting would be a very good thing.
Besides, I'd get to hang around you all day.
- Uh, Frank?
- Uh-huh?
- You and I are buddies, right?
- Right.
- Good friends?
- Right.
Well, I just wanted to know.
Oh, I see what you're getting at.
- The male animal has certain needs?
- No.
Well, no offense, but you're a little bit too skinny for me.
- I am?
- Yeah.
I mean, I like big broads.
You know?
Zaftig.
So, don't sweat it.
Okay, I won't sweat it.
Here's our passport to good eating.
This is Frank Carelli with the sports.
Frank, you gotta do it my way.
Am I getting through to you, Frank?
Frank, I wanna help you, so I have to know if I'm getting through.
- Am I getting through to you?
- One more to go before your audition.
Mary, I can't do a thing with this man.
He won't listen to me.
How can I help but listen to you the way you're screaming?
I'm only screaming at you because I wanna help you.
- Stop screaming if you wanna help me.
- Both of you, please stop this.
- What seems to be the problem?
- I wrote a special copy for him.
But he insists on reading his copy.
Read your copy.
Let Mary judge.
She'll say it's rotten.
Then I can help you, Frank!
Good evening.
Frank Carelli here with the world of sports.
In the world of baseball today, it was Baltimore: 7; New York: 6.
The White Sox: 8,; Oakland: zero.
Cincinnati at Philadelphia: rained out.
I thought that "rained out" added a nice touch of realism.
- You see what I mean?
- Listen, Frank.
Maybe if you tried, um, smiling.
On the other hand, uh, maybe serious is better.
Well, better get in there.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
I'm just psyching myself up like I used to before every game.
He's gonna bite a cameraman.
Oh, no.
What's the matter?
Well, that's Timmy Brown over there.
He was all-pro halfback for three years.
He's good-looking, intelligent, popular.
Hey, Frank.
How you been?
Hi!
How are you, Timmy?
Gee whiz, it's good to see you again.
The last time I saw you, you were going right over me for a touchdown.
They'll be ready for you in a minute, Frank.
- I'll be hearing from you, Lou.
- Nice going, Timmy.
- Good to see you, Frank.
- Yeah.
Listen, I wanna warn you about something.
It'll be luckier for you if you don't get this job.
This is not such a hot place to work.
Right?
I'll say.
Did I get through to you, Frank?
All right, now, go in and get set up for your audition.
And stick around afterwards.
We can talk about some insurance.
- He doesn't have a chance, does he?
- No.
Timmy was terrific.
And he had to be because my wife wasn't half bad.
This is Frank Carelli with with the sports.
Today in the world of baseball it was I blew it.
- Thank you girls for your help.
- Where you going?
I don't know.
I think I'll go take a long walk.
- Frank, it's ten degrees below zero.
- I'll take a short walk.
Just come right back and sit down and we'll just all talk, okay?
- That's what friends are for.
- There goes my sportscasting career, just like my car selling career and my insurance selling career.
Why don't you just get a job?
What do you need a career for?
Because that's what you're supposed to have.
Look at Frank Gifford.
- I'll bet he makes close to - Who cares what Frank Gifford makes?
There are other jobs you can have besides being a sportscaster.
Are all ex-pro ballplayers sportscasters?
What else do they do?
- Besides owning restaurants?
- Yes.
- Only first-stringers own restaurants.
- I know that.
If you were on a championship team, maybe you could own a bar.
- But you don't own a restaurant.
- Because I never made first string.
- What else do they do?
- Besides owning restaurants?
- Yes!
- I don't know.
Let me think.
Yeah, there was Whizzer White.
Now, he has a fantastic job.
He makes $60,000 a year, and besides, they can't fire him.
- What does he do?
- He's a Supreme Court judge.
Talk about contacts.
Isn't there something just a little simpler?
Yeah.
Jim Brown's got a real simple job.
He acts with Raquel What's Her Name and makes 100 grand a picture.
Frank, if you could do anything in the world, what would you do?
- Play ball.
- Besides that.
- Hang around Mary.
- Come on, Frank.
So I haven't thought about it.
Yeah, one thing I know I'd do for sure.
- What?
- Go back to Florida!
The people here are terrific, but the weather is for polar bears.
- Then why are you living here?
- This is where my contacts are.
I couldn't even get a job selling insurance in Miami.
But, Frank, you don't want a job selling insurance.
Hey, maybe if my contacts here knew some contacts down in Florida.
Would you just forget about the contacts and think about what you really want?
I got enough money for airfare and maybe one or two weeks down there.
Frank, you're healthy.
You won't starve to death.
Do you girls know what it is like down in Florida right now?
Tomorrow the sun will be shining.
I bet it's gonna be 80 degrees and I'm gonna do it.
Yeah, before I change my mind, I'm gonna do it.
You know what I'm gonna do the first thing when I get off the airplane?
I'm gonna throw away this dumb overcoat, and I'm gonna run down to the beach and go diving into the water.
And while I'm floating on my back, I'll be thinking about you two girls and wondering what I'm doing floating in the water with my clothes on.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Hey, Frank.
- Thanks, I should leave more often.
- Oh!
- You let us hear from you.
Sure.
Miami, here I come!
Hey.
If things go wrong, can I come back here and hang around?
No, you cannot!
Anything interesting?
Hey, what's that?
I don't know.
It doesn't have a return address.
Maybe it's obscene.
Wait, they do send things in plain, unmarked brown wrappers, don't they?
- Right.
- I better open it.
- Never heard of an obscene tape.
- They're constantly innovating.
Okay, let's play it and see what we got here.
Mary, maybe it's a collection" The All-time Great Obscene Phone Calls".
- I'll give you one guess.
- Hi, Mary, and you too, Rhoda.
This is Frank Carelli with the sports.
I'm just kidding.
Look, I'm sorry I took so long to write, but you know how it is.
I'm talking to you from sunny Florida.
For a while, it looked like nobody wanted an ex-guard down here.
- Frank, can you fix this?
- Oh, sure, kid.
You just gotta bend it like this.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
I thought of coming back to Minneapolis, but I didn't even have the fare.
- Frank, the game's starting.
- Throw the ball around, warm up.
So I found this job as a playground director.
I work in a pretty park all day, and the kids think I'm a hero because I played pro ball.
So I try and teach 'em how to play, but not guard quarterback or running back or - Frank?
- Okay, be right there.
I'm sorry, ladies.
I gotta go now.
I promise to write real soon.
Sincerely yours, Frank Carelli.
Did you hear that?
He's teaching all those little kids to be quarterbacks.
Isn't that beautiful?
He wants them all to own restaurants someday.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all Mary!
- Yes, Mr. Grant?
- Where are you going?
It's 7:30.
The show's been over for a half hour.
I don't have anything to do, so I thought I'd go home.
In a little while.
- Fill out that form and send it in tonight.
- For the Emmys?
Nah.
The television editors, every single year since last year, give out something called the Teddy.
Television editors, Teddy.
Cute, right?
So fill out the best available candidates we have in each news category.
By tonight?
A person I know at WCCO had to do this.
It took her days.
That's because WCCO has a lot of good things to choose between.
In case you haven't noticed, we don't have that kind of problem.
-  - That should take you about three minutes.
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah?
She's here, but she can't come to the phone.
- Why can't I come to the phone?
- 'Cause she's in conference.
Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.
- Am I too busy to ask who that was?
- That was your friend Rhoda.
She said it wasn't important, but to call the second you get home because it's important.
- You understand that?
- Yeah, not that important.
- Come on.
I'll give you a lift.
- Thanks, Murray, but I gotta stay and fill in these forms for the Teddy Awards.
The Teddys?
Don't tell me it's been a year already.
I'll help you.
Teddys?
Did I hear someone mention the Teddys?
Here comes Mr. Award-Happy.
Every year when they announce who won the Nobel prize, he's disappointed.
The best local news program?
Isn't her loyalty touching?
She's writing us in.
Best male personality?
Only one of those three words comes close to describing you.
It isn't "best," and it's certainly not "personality".
I don't have to sit here and take that.
Ted, look.
"Best male personality: Ted Baxter".
- You won't be sorry.
- Best newswriting.
Which story of mine should we write in?
How about that story you did about that large thingamajig somebody found, and he took it to the police no, he took it to his mother and then they did something with it?
Yeah.
Who could forget that one?
I think my reporting on the flood was better.
- Let's see.
We're gonna need a title.
- Uh, how about "Flood Story"?
- Ah!
- Flood?
What flood?
Think back.
Remember the day you had to row to work?
Oh, that flood.
There it is.
- "Best newscaster and" -  "Best TV personality".
Well, I guess there's nothing left for me, - so, uh, good night, all.
- Good night.
- You finished yet?
- Uh, yes, just about.
So, good night, all.
-  Good night, Ted.
-  Good night.
Mar, best TV personality.
Well, that about does it.
How come you haven't filled in best public affairs program?
- How about our Sunday News Conference?
- Well, that's my show.
- So?
- You really think it's good enough to win an award?
No, but I think it's the only one we got.
Put it down.
Mr. Grant, I feel silly.
I mean, I just can't write in my own show.
- Okay, don't, then.
- Would you do it for me?
How come you didn't call me the second you got home?
This is the second I got home.
Mary, it happened.
It?
The big it?
- Yeah, I'm engaged.
- No!
You're right, I'm not engaged, but he's closin' in.
- Who?
- His name is Bob Peterson.
We met in my speed-reading class.
He's perfect.
Green eyes and 1,700 words a minute.
It's for real.
Oh, Rhoda!
I love this.
Good news and the girlfriends hug.
Let me help you, Mar.
Ah, when you're in love, you suddenly feel like doing mad things, like putting groceries away.
- You wanna hear what he said?
- Yeah.
"I want you to know I'm getting serious about you, Rhoda".
And they gave the Pulitzer prize to Arthur Miller.
Speaking of the Pulitzer prize, I've got good news too.
- My show got nominated - You gonna be home tonight?
- for the Yeah, I guess so.
- Good.
I want to get an outside opinion on Bob.
If I was back in New York, I'd bring him home to my mother, which would be a major mistake.
- So would you like to be my mother?
- Okay, but don't be too late.
Perfect!
Eh.
I gotta go get ready.
- Who is it?
- It's me Rhoda and Bob.
You're not asleep yet, are ya?
No.
No, uh, I wasn't asleep.
Not at all.
I was just, uh Be right there.
- Hi there!
- Mary, this is Bob.
B-O-B.
Bob?
- Oh!
Bob.
Hi, Bob.
- Hi.
Hi.
Did we wake you up?
Did we?
I told you 2:00 is too late.
- I think we'd better go.
- No, no, you didn't wake me up.
I was just watching a book.
Listen.
Please, uh, do come in.
And here, let me take your coats.
Oh, the reason the bed looks like this is, uh, I didn't make it this morning.
She's a messy housekeeper.
Hey, hey!
I'll do it.
I'm very good at this.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
There we go.
- Well.
-  Well, this is Bob.
Doesn't he look terrific?
Yes, terrific.
Just terrific.
You both, you look terrific.
Everyone here looks terrific except me.
If you look this terrific in the middle of the night, I can imagine what you look like in the middle of the day.
She looks great anytime night, day, morning.
You should see me in the morning.
Yech!
Good one, Rhoda.
Tell him how yechy you look in the morning.
How about this girl?
Is she like this all the time?
She gets even better.
Oh, my, I've had such a nice day.
- How about you, Bob?
Did you have a nice day?
- I had a terrific day.
- How about you, Mar?
- Huh?
It's a little, um, early to tell yet, you know?
- I did, um, have a nice day yesterday, however.
- Oh, yeah?
What happened?
My show got nominated for a Teddy.
- No kidding?
That's terrific.
- Congratulations.
Well, no, it wasn't really nominated.
It's just It's been, uh, nominated to be nominated.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Coffee.
Coffee.
That's what we need, is a little coffee.
Well, what do you think of that Mary?
Isn't she terrific?
Yeah, she's lovely.
Just lovely.
Lovely.
- One's enough.
- Huh?
Listen, I'm gonna go find out how you're doing.
Wait here.
What do you think?
Rhoda, when you said you had an early date, I didn't think you meant early as in early in the morning.
I told you we'd be by tonight.
lfigured you might be worried and waiting up.
Worried?
I don't know, maybe I'm a bad mother, but I wasn't worried and I wasn't waiting up.
Well, anyway, what do you think about him, huh?
- He's nice.
- Yeah?
- Really nice.
- Uh-huh?
Unusually nice.
Unique in his niceness.
Mary, do you really think so?
Rhoda, I don't know.
I just met him.
He's nice.
Bob, would you excuse me just a minute?
Sure.
- What did she say?
- She thinks you're nice.
- Is that what she said?
- Yeah, nice.
It turns out she wasn't reading a book.
I think we'd better split.
You know what would be a good idea?
Ask her to go out with us tomorrow.
- Make it up to her for barging in.
- You know something?
- You are nice.
- Yeah.
Hey, Mary?
I'll be out in a second.
I was wondering well, Rhoda and l do you like basketball?
Uh, yeah.
It's okay, I guess.
Great.
We'll pick you up tomorrow night at 7:30, sharp.
- Come on.
Let's go.
- Good night, Mar.
- See you tomorrow, kid.
- Uh, what'd you say?
Did you say something, Rhoda?
Bob?
I'm gonna kill her.
I have no use for the nominating committee of the Teddy Awards.
- Didn't any of us get nominated?
- Ha, all of you got nominated.
What?
- You're kidding.
We all got nominated?
- I hear the nominations are in.
Yes, l Ted, I got nominated.
I mean, I didn't, but my show did, but that's like me getting nominated, isn't it?
- Get out of my way!
- Yes.
- Mary, congratulations.
- Oh, Murray, you too.
- I only have three nominations?
- Well, Ted, you were only up for three.
Oh.
Well, that's not so bad.
I should've been up for more, though, Mar.
- I know.
- Let's go to lunch and congratulate each other.
Oh, I would love to would I love to but I've gotta have lunch with Rhoda and her boyfriend.
We've been group-dating for a couple of weeks now.
- Everything's done in groups lately.
- Yeah.
Actually, we have pretty good times.
Bob calls us the Three Musketeers.
# Da da-da dum da-da # He likes to do that # Da-dum da-da # - He's really a lot of fun, only - Only what?
Well, I don't know.
l It's just that sometimes I get the feeling that he - Oh, it's nothing.
- It's something.
Sometimes I get the feeling that Bob's - interested in me.
- Ah-ha!
- Mar.
- Yes, Ted?
It just occurred to me that I did do the weather forecast - for two weeks when Gordy was sick.
- Uh-huh.
- I was just wondering - No, it wouldn't qualify you for best weatherman.
Hmph!
So you really think he is, huh?
- Is what?
- Dating Rhoda to be with you.
I didn't say that.
-  I know.
- Hi, Mary.
Ready for lunch?
Oh, hi, Bob.
Um, Bob Peterson, - I'd like you to meet Murray Slaughter.
- Nice to meet you.
- Where's, uh, Rhoda?
- One of her window displays is taking longer than she thought - You mean she's not gonna be having lunch with us?
- That's right.
Looks like it'll be just us two Musketeers.
# Da-dum da-da # - # Da-da da-da # - # Da-da da-da #  # Da-da da-da # - So you and Bob spent the entire lunch talking about me?
- Mm-hmm.
- Like what about me?
- Mm.
Why are you so hungry?
You two did go to lunch, didn't you?
Rhoda, that's being a little silly, and you know it.
- So you talked about Rhoda?
Yeah?
- Yeah!
I told him that cute story about you when we took skiing lessons.
- Oh, yeah, the skiing - Right.
You were the cute one in the skiing story.
Rhoda you know, I think there's been a little too much group-dating lately.
- And you'd like me to bow out?
Is that it?
- Oh, come on!
I know, I know.
Don't listen to me.
I'm crazy.
- Let's just change the subject.
- Good.
What's happening with that show of yours?
Didn't I tell you?
We got nominated.
We made it into the finals for the Teddy Awards.
- Oh, wonderful!
- Yeah.
Isn't that great?
Listen.
They're giving out the awards at a luncheon on Saturday.
- I've got a couple of tickets.
Why don't you go with me?
- Oh, I'd love to.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Bob.
We were just talking about you.
I bet I know why you called me because you called Rhoda first, and she wasn't at home, and so you figured that she was here, and you were right.
She's sitting right here.
Guess who it is.
- Bob?
- Right, and he wants to talk to you.
Don't you, Bob?
Right.
Here's Rhoda.
Hello, Bob.
Wasn't it lucky you caught me here?
Yeah.
Listen.
I think our Three Musketeers should have a meeting and discuss which Musketeer you like best.
That was sort of a short meeting, wasn't it?
Oh, yeah.
Great.
We're still friends.
You're the best friend I ever had.
Good-bye, Bob.
# Da da-dum ba-dum # - Rhoda?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
Look, it's forgotten.
It's not important.
I'd just like to finish my dinner.
- Thanks for dinner, Mary.
- Wait.
You have got to stay and listen to me.
- Okay, what do you have to say?
- Nothing.
Hey, come on.
Don't make a big deal out of this, please.
- Rhoda, listen - You know that awards thing we're going to on Saturday?
- Yeah.
- I'm not going.
Mary, what I mean to say is, right now I can think of better ways to spend Saturday than watching you win an award, you know?
- I'm not gonna win.
- You're not?
- No, I'll probably lose.
- In that case, I'll go with you.
-  - Hello.
Testing, testing.
- One, two, three, four.
Testing.
-  Sorry, folks.
I just wanted your attention.
Would you please take your seats.
We have to be moving right along now because the luncheon took longer than we anticipated, and there's another group using the room after us thank you.
- Do you think we'll win, Mar?
- I think you'll win, Ted.
It would be appropriate, wouldn't it, for a Teddy to win a Teddy?
It would be more appropriate if they had called this award a Dummy.
I'm nervous for you.
These award things are murder.
My wife loves them.
When John Wayne got the Oscar, she cried.
And that woman never shed a tear at our daughter's wedding.
-  What are you up for?
- Second cousin.
- What?
- My name is Hartunian.
I'm waiting here for the Armenian wedding that's next.
- You're a little early, aren't you?
- If you don't come early to an Armenian wedding, you can starve to death.
##  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Second Annual Television Editors Awards.
We'll be announcing the winners in just a moment, but, first, let's honor our distinguished nominees.
Would all the nominees please stand and accept our applause.
Just like an Armenian wedding when they ask the immediate family to stand up.
Does everyone have their acceptance speeches ready?
I think I'm gonna just make up something on the spur of the moment, like "Thank you".
Isn't it funny how you keep hoping that you'll win, even though you know you don't have a chance?
- You know what I said before?
Forget it.
I hope you win.
- Thank you.
You just blew your acceptance speech.
Ladies and gentlemen, since the other party is waiting out in the hall to set up, I'm afraid we'll have to dispense with the acceptance speeches.
- Ahh!
- Uh, yes, sir?
Ted Baxter, WJ M-TV.
Since we don't have time for our acceptance speeches and I wrote three of them may we at least stand and be acknowledged by our peers when we receive our Teddys?
Of course you can.
We weren't gonna throw them at you.
Whoever heard of such a thing?
Whoever heard of awards without acceptance speeches?
It's barbaric.
And now, our first category is for the best male personality.
And the nominees are: Lyle Taggert, Jack Perry, Harry Bibbs and Ted Baxter.
And the winner is Jack Perry.
-  - ##  Well, that's not fair.
He's on educational television.
Who watches educational television?
Mary, that's a great-looking statue.
It'll look great in your apartment.
Yeah, I guess it will would, if I win, but I probably won't.
And now, for best newscaster, the nominees are: Joe Clark, Bob Hughes, Walter Matthews, Ted Baxter.
And the winner is - Walter Matthews.
- ##  Look at him.
What's he standing up for?
I guess he just wants to be acknowledged by his peers.
-  We're not We're not through yet.
- What's going on?
You see those white flowers over there?
They're from me to the bride and groom.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must move right along.
We have quite a few more categories to cover.
And now, for best public affairs program, the nominees are: Sunday Afternoon News Makers, Richard Cox, ; Sunday Afternoon Review, Michael Bronson; Sunday Afternoon Hot Seat, Harry Marx, ; and Sunday Afternoon News Conference, Mary Richards.
And the winner is -  -  -  What?
- He said you.
Yes!
- Did he?
I won?
- I'm sure he did.
Go on, get it.
- Go get it.
-  Did you hear?
The winner is Michael Bronson.
##  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
You get used to it.
Wasn't that the most boring thing you ever sat through in your whole life?
Yeah.
That Armenian wedding wasn't too hot, either.
- Aren't you gonna come in?
- I think I'll just go upstairs.
- You know, Rhoda, I think we're not quite friends yet.
- What makes you think that?
'Cause I can remember a time when you used to walk all the way into my apartment.
Oh, Mary.
It's just that I'm bad at making people feel better, that's all.
I don't feel that bad.
That's surprising, Mar, after you stood up in front of all those people, making a big fool of yourself like you did.
Rhoda, I think we have a little problem between us.
Oh, Mary, I told you, I haven't thought about Bob at all.
It's over.
No, no, we didn't have a problem with Bob.
No, no.
We have a problem because I am not too crazy about the fact that you are so happy that I lost.
You think I'm happy over you falling on your face like you did?
Ah-ha!
You see, that's just what I'm talking about.
- Ever since that phone call - Wait a minute.
Do you really think I sat there rooting for my best friend to lose?
That I enjoyed it when you thought they called your name?
When you said they called my name.
Did I?
Oh, seriously, Mar, now I'm laughing about it, but back there, when that happened you rushed up, then lost the award it was the happiest moment of my life.
Hmm-hmm-hmm!
So what are you smiling at me for?
I'm a terrible person.
Rhoda, you are not terrible, because I just discovered something so wonderful: Everybody is terrible.
- I gotta tell you something.
I have a little confession.
- Oh, yeah?
I have always resented the fact that you make more money than I do, - and I think my job is a lot more important than yours.
- No.
- Yes.
Now do you see why I was "hmm-hmm-ing"?
- Really?
- Now, l Oh, I got another one for you.
- What?
I have always resented the fact that you have this marvelous apartment and don't know how to decorate it.
- Oh, I feel like I have a giant weight off my shoulders.
- Right.
- Isn't this wonderful, to talk honestly like this?
- It is.
Right, yeah.
- Mm, I got another one for you.
- Shoot.
When I found out that Bob liked me,  the way I really felt was I think we've had enough honest talking for tonight, don't you?
- Good morning, Ted.
- What is that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Well, I guess I'm a little upset about the awards.
I'm sorry you didn't win.
Thank you.
I'm sorry you didn't win.
Didn't win.
Didn't win.
.
Just because I lost three times is no reason for you to Just what we don't need dissension on the news team.
Next thing you know, they'll be having fistfights in the locker room.
I think it's time for a little picker-upper.
- Mr. Grant, y-you don't want - No, no, not that kind.
- This kind.
- Where'd you get that?
I bought it at the Tinker Trophy Company.
I figure we give it to the whole newsroom, everybody feels like they've won something, pick up their spirits.
Oh, Mr. Grant, that is so warm and, and lovely Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, everybody, take ten.
I have something to say to you.
The morale in this office is decidedly lousy.
Okay, so you didn't win a Teddy, but you won the Tinker.
- What's the Tinker?
- Mary.
Here it is.
- What's the Tinker?
- Who cares?
I want to thank all the people that helped me win this award.
I don't have time to mention all their names, but they know who they are.
- A lot of people wonder how you reach a point like this.
-  Well, you start as a staff announcer in 1952 in a television station in a small 5,000-watt radio station in Fresno, California.
A lot of people ask me what my secret is.
And I say, well, persevere.
Persevere, persevere, persevere.
And in time, if you're fortunate, if you're lucky, you may reach the great heights that I really don't know what else to say.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all - Fan mail come in yet, Murr?
- No, not yet, Ted.
- Good morning, everybody.
I'm sorry I'm late.
- Hi.
- Has Mr. Grant been asking for me?
- No, and it's a good thing.
- You know how crazy he gets when anybody's late.
- Yeah.
Is he in there?
No.
He's late.
- This the fan mail, Mar?
- I don't know, Ted.
I haven't had a chance to go through it.
I, l Chuckles the Clown, Chuckles the Clown.
Chuckles the Clown.
Clown, clown, clown, clown.
- This isn't the newsroom mail.
- No, here's yours, Ted.
How come Chuckles the Clown gets more mail than I do?
The morning prayer gets more mail than you do.
- Mary, this is for you.
- A fan letter for me?
Well, I doubt it.
It's from the United States Treasury Department.
Maybe it's a refund.
No, it's a letter.
It's typed.
There's a signature on the bottom, and it looks important.
So, uh, what what do you think?
Oh, Mary, I'm sorry.
Deeply sorry.
Well, ju Wait a minute, Ted.
It's not that bad.
- I'm just being audited on my income tax.
- Just being audited?
That's like saying you're just being drafted.
Isn't it funny how all of a sudden you can get a letter and feel guilty?
I didn't do anything wrong, I don't think.
I always say, it pays to have a great tax man.
It costs me five dollars more a year, but it's worth it.
Too bad I'm losing him.
He's graduating and going on to college.
Well, I don't see how I could be in any trouble at all.
I mean, I keep complete records of everything.
l-I keep such complete records, my friends kid me about it.
- What do they say?
- They say, " Mary, you keep such complete records".
- They're some funny kidders.
- Well, I do!
I keep the records, and I declare all of my income.
I, uh, uh I what?
Well, I declare almost all my income.
I mean, if you're walking down the street and you see a dime, you don't declare that, do you?
- No.
- If you're walking around the office and somebody tells you you won $10 in a World Series pool, you don't declare that, do you?
- No.
- And if you're walking around your apartment and the phone rings and it's a college student asking you to type up his thesis for $75 - Yes, you do.
They got you.
- I didn't.
You know, Mary, you're the only person I know who bakes cookies for an audit by the United States government.
Yeah, well, Murray said it wouldn't hurt to make them feel comfortable.
I didn't know you could get audited in your home.
So if they find you guilty, what do they do, lock you in your room?
Good luck.
See you later.
Hey, Rhoda, why don't you stick around to help break the ice?
Oh, wonderful.
Thanks a lot.
You have a date with a $20,000 a year engineer, it's " Bye, Rhoda, see you later".
But a T-man with an adding machine shows up, and it's "Why don't you stick around"?
It's just that I'm very nervous.
I wish he'd get here.
I'd just like to get it over with.
Will you relax?
You're making a big deal out of nothing.
- You know how those guys are.
He'll probably be late.
- Uh-uh.
I got a feeling this one is awfully precise.
- How can you tell?
- He made the appointment for 8:03.
- It's 8:03 right now.
-  Hi.
I'm Robert C. Brand from the Internal Revenue Service, and I wonder if either of you ladies are Mary Richards?
She's Mary Richards, sir.
Sorry.
It's just that you're not the way I pictured you'd be.
- She thought you were gonna be old and mean.
- And you're young and - Mean?
Yeah.
No, I'm not.
- Yeah.
No!
- Come on in.
- Thank you.
If you need to borrow any money, I'll be upstairs rereading the Constitution.
He's cute.
Listen, I'm sorry that I'm almost late, but I had a flat tire and it slowed me up a lot driving on it.
- You didn't stop to change it?
- Oh, no, no, that would have made me very late.
- This is a nice place.
- Oh, well, it's not really that nice.
It's very small, very inexpensive.
Uh, it's This is the whole apartment.
I even sleep in here.
Oh.
I sleep in my apartment too.
- You want to plug that in, don't you?
- Yes, mm-hmm.
- Well, right over here.
- Oh, fine.
All right.
- Can I take your coat?
- That's very nice of you.
- Most people I audit never ask me that.
- Oh, they don't?
No.
I think they think that as long as I have on my overcoat that I'll be leaving soon.
Ah, good.
A wooden one.
Well, we'll just get this show on the road now, all right?
- Uh Mr. Brand l-I want to tell you something.
- Yes?
I earned $75 typing a master's thesis, $75 cash, which I didn't report.
I just I forgot.
I didn't forget!
I just I didn't know I was supposed to.
But I want to report it now, $75.
I'm reporting it.
That's really very nice of you.
It's really funny though, 'cause that's just the kind of thing we hardly ever catch.
All right, now, listen.
It's going to be a very long night ahead of us, all right?
I want you to sit down, relax, make yourself at home and have a drink, all right?
- Would you like a drink?
- I'll have a vodka tonic.
Just as soon as I fix it for myself.
- Would you like a drink?
- Oh, a martini, yes.
- Martini.
- But I'm not allowed to drink while I'm auditing.
- It's highly unethical.
You know what I mean?
- Oh.
But, uh, if you're the type that doesn't mind drinking alone l No.
I, uh A chocolate cookie is all I need.
How about you?
- Oh, fine.
Nothing unethical about that.
- No.
Mmm.
All right, Miss Richards, as you probably don't know, all income tax forms are sent to our main office where they are analyzed, sorted and processed by very high-speed computers.
- However, in your case, it was completely different.
- Oh?
Yes, yours bypassed the computers completely and came directly to my desk.
- Why did it do that?
- Well, you had 18 cents postage due.
- Oh, well, here's that.
- No, no, no, none of that.
No, no, no.
We'll just put it right on your tab.
Eighteen cents, six-percent interest at six months.
All right.
Now, let's see.
Do you have any of your any of your records handy?
Any All.
All of my records.
I have everything.
I have saved all my receipts, my check stubs, just about everything you'd need right in here.
Oh, I wonder if you have anything in a nice brown loafer?
You knew that was a joke, didn't you?
- Yes.
-  Well, I just I figure why spend a lot of money on a filing cabinet.
- It's just as easy to keep them in the shoe boxes.
- Sure.
Besides, that way it's a great excuse once a year to buy an extra pair of shoes.
- Oh, I see.
That explains it.
- Explains what?
Oh, well, your $14.95 shoe deductions under "office supplies".
The United States government will not allow that.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.
All righty.
Hmm.
Now, what have we here?
This looks like an ice cream stick.
Yes, it is.
I can explain that.
You see, last year I took a lot of YWCA kids on a picnic, and while we were in the park, I bought them each an ice cream bar from the man in the truck.
So I put it under "charitable donations," and the amount is written there.
I see.
Well, you know, I really hate to seem, like, nit-picking, but it's customary to have the salesperson's signature on the receipt.
Yes, it is.
Name and license number right on the back.
- Son of a gun.
- See?
That's why I don't understand why I'm being audited.
I mean, I keep such complete records Lipstick, $26.
For lipstick?
Well, you see, Mr. Brand, I work in a television newsroom, and Well, you know the large markers you use for the cue Well, you don't.
But we use large marking pens for making cue cards.
We ran out, and the only thing I could find was a case of lipstick in the drugstore.
Can you tell me this?
Was any of this said lipstick ever used on your own p-personal lips?
Well, it, uh, was my shade.
Hmm.
Well It says here that you declare your grandmother as a deduction.
- Is that true?
- Yes, I do.
I send her $45 every month.
- Is there anything wrong with that?
- That's so admirable of you.
That's really nice; however, it's not the least bit deductible.
- That should do it.
- Oh, good.
Then we're finished.
No, not at all, not at all.
I have a feeling this is gonna be a very long, drawn-out process.
We might have to go back six or seven years, for all I know.
Anyway, it all gets very, very messy, and I'm tired of talking about business.
Me too.
I don't know if I could take any more tonight.
Uh, I wonder if we could, uh, grab a bite to eat?
What?
Nothing.
I didn't say anything.
Yes, you did.
You said something.
I just didn't hear it.
No.
No, I didn't.
Well, I just wondered if, well, if maybe we could have dinner?
- Oh, well, thank you, but l - No.
No.
I know.
It's dumb of me.
I never asked anybody I was auditing out to dinner anyway.
I'm crazy.
Well, l No, look, yes.
Yes, that would be nice.
I would like that.
Well, you know, uh, I'm auditing this Chinese restaurant downtown.
And they Well, they've got just a terrific Sub Gum duck.
- It's wonderful, if that appeals to you.
- Yes, it does.
Could I use your telephone to make a reservation?
- Yes, you may.
Sure.
- Thank you, thank you.
Oh, well, now here comes another first.
Uh, I've really never asked this of anybody I'm auditing before, but I wonder if I don't get paid till tomorrow night.
Could you loan me ten dollars?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Is a bribe deductible?
It was a joke.
Murr, have you finished my editorial analysis of the president's speech?
Oh, thanks, Murr.
Did I agree or disagree with him this time?
Read it.
Be surprised.
Oh, good, we agreed.
I like to agree with the president.
A lot of people are afraid of controversy, but I always say, "Take a stand".
- What the heck he talk about?
- Girl Scout Week.
- Good morning, everybody.
-  Morning, Mary.
Oh, hey, what happened with your tax audit last night?
- Nothing happened.
- Nothing happened?
Something always happens in a tax audit.
Now, come on.
Tell us what happened.
Well, nothing happened.
He asked me a few questions, and then he took me out to din-ner.
- Took you out to where?
- Dinner.
Dinner?
I was audited once.
He didn't take me out to dinner.
Well, what happened after dinner, and how much of a refund are you getting?
Look, I know this is gonna disappoint you, but here's exactly what happened.
He took me out to a nice, ethical Chinese restaurant, where we had ethical Sub Gum duck.
In between bites, he asked me questions about my grandmother, then he drove me home.
Yes, he opened the car door for me, and that was it.
Honest.
- Okay, Mary.
-  - Is this the newsroom?
- Uh, yeah, kid.
I'll take those.
I'm sorry.
I don't have any change.
- Well, I do.
- Good.
Murr, were you expecting roses from anyone?
- Not me.
How about you, Ted?
- No.
- I wonder who they could be for.
- Why, they're for Mary.
Well, what do you know!
- Who's Robert C. Brand?
- Tax auditor.
A refund?
So soon?
I lent him ten dollars, and he's simply paying me back.
- Well, what are the roses for?
- Interest.
- Boy, am I stuffed.
- Me too.
That had to be the world's largest chef's salad.
What did you expect?
Did you check the size of that chef?
I gotta get back to work.
I just came up here to check out what new loot you got from old Robert C. - Is this it?
- Yeah, it's a candy-gram.
He likes to send me presents, but he doesn't do it unless it's related to business.
How is a box of candy related to business?
"Please bring last October's check stubs".
Mushy, isn't he?
I don't know why I'm putting this in my mouth.
I should just apply it directly to my hips.
You know, he has been taking me places and sending me presents for over a week now.
I don't know what to say to him to make him stop.
- How about "Stop"?
- Rhoda, I just explained to you through an entire chef's salad that I can't do that.
It would hurt his feelings, and I can't do that.
Mary, are you going out with him because you like him, or is it because you're afraid if he doesn't like you he'll send you up the river to the big house?
You know, it is a really weird relationship.
- I don't even know if we're going out on dates.
- Do you dress up?
- Yeah.
- Then it's a date.
But he calls me Miss Richards, and we talk about withholding a lot.
- Then it's not a date.
It's just steady auditing.
- Yeah.
Newsroom.
Yes, this is Miss Richards.
Well, hello, Mr. Brand.
"Miss Richards," "Mr. Brand".
I don't feel I should be hearing this.
Will you shut up?
What?
Oh.
Sure.
Fine.
Yes, I'd like that.
All right.
I'll see you there.
Bye.
- Rhoda, I just did the dumbest thing.
- What?
I just made a date to go right back downstairs and have another lu-lunch.
Snack-O-Rama.
Just a second.
I'll see.
Is there a Ronald C. Grant here?
No, that's Robert C. Brand.
- Phone.
- Thank you.
- Listen, don't talk too long.
This phone is for takeouts.
- I know.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Mr. Jackson.
Yes.
Well, no, I know that I'm still working on the Mary Richards case.
I know I have other cases to do.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Well, no, doggone it.
You'll just have to tell U.S. Steel to wait.
Uh-huh.
Well, uh, l Well, anyway, I should be finished with Mary's case in about well, very, very soon.
Thank you very much.
Good-bye, Mr Jackson.
Mr. Brand?
Hi, Miss Richards.
W- Would you like to sit down?
- Okay, you ready to order now?
- Yes.
Hi.
Uh The special for today is the complete - Do you know what you'd like?
- Well, I'm not terribly hungry.
- Why don't you just have a salad?
- Uh, well I'll have the special, and give the young lady a chef's salad.
- Again?
- I eat here a lot.
I'll say.
Well, listen, while we're waiting, we should get some business done, all right?
Well, Mr. Brand, I don't think anyone here would turn us in if we didn't discuss business.
No, I think we should do some business.
Well, we didn't do any business when we went to the movie last night.
- Oh, yes, we did.
I'm auditing the usher there.
- Oh.
Now, Miss Richards, I'm sort of stumped by this deduction here on Schedule "B".
I can't quite read your writing.
Is this a four or a nine?
I think it's a four.
Mr. Brand?
That was me, yes.
Oh, Miss Richards, I don't I don't know what came over me, honestly!
I saw you leaning over Schedule "B" like that, and I just I'm just such an animal.
I don't know.
I have never kissed anybody I've audited before, I promise you.
- I've had plenty of chances No!
No!
- Mr. Brand.
Robert.
- I know what you must think of me.
- No, you don't know.
No, l I feel so cheap.
Mr. Brand, there is no reason for you to feel guilty.
- It was okay.
- J-Just okay?
Well, it was nice okay.
Miss Richards under "charitable deductions," you have an item about  about ice cream bars.
Mr. Brand, we've covered the ice cream bars.
Of course.
Okay.
Oh, now, here, this under "grandmother deduction".
Mr. Brand, we have covered everything there is to be covered.
Did we really?
Amazing.
Seven years, just like that.
Does that mean that you're finished with the audit?
Yes, it's finished.
Do-Do you have any idea how much it will be?
No, I have no idea, but I'd like you to know the fact that I kissed you, or didn't kiss you, has no bearing whatsoever on how much you owe, you know?
I understand.
That's for the gentleman, and, uh, the usual for the lady.
Where do you put it, honey?
-  -  Mary, you home?
Yeah.
Come on in.
- What are you doing?
- Going through my checkbook, looking for mistakes.
Isn't it a little late for that?
I thought he finished your audit.
I'm trying to find some extra money.
I have a feeling I'm gonna owe it.
- What makes you think that?
- Well, for one thing, I haven't heard from Robert in a week.
- Now, you know that's gotta be a bad sign.
- Not even a candy bar, huh?
You know the funny thing?
I really I kind of miss him.
Look, it can't be that bad.
I mean, he kissed you, didn't he?
Yeah, but he said the fact that he kissed me would have absolutely no bearing on whether I owed the government money or not.
- Anyway, he missed.
- He missed?
Well, he just sort of grazed me.
- Grazed you?
- Yeah, a couple of times.
Whatever you say, Mar.
See you later.
- Great.
- Hi there!
- Did you find any of that extra money yet?
- No.
Too bad.
Mr. Brand, you're here!
I, uh I thought you'd come in the mail.
I mean that it would come in the mail.
Well, please, come in and sit down.
Well, actually, this won't take that long.
Well, do you mind if I sit down?
The, uh The amount you owe is on the inside.
Please make the check out to Internal Revenue Service and mail it to your nearest district office.
Eight thousand dollars?
Eight thousand dollars!
Oh, no, no!
You don't understand.
- That's your entire income for last year.
- Oh, thank you.
No, no.
This is what you owe right here.
- I can't see it.
Where?
- Right here.
Sixteen dollars.
And 73 cents.
- Oh!
- You don't have it, do you?
- I'll loan it to you.
I'll give it to you.
- Oh, no!
I'm just so very grateful.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Oh, you didn't cheat?
No.
No, ma'am.
I would never cheat, ever, ever.
I, uh Well, I thought about it for a second, but I would never cheat, really.
Well, I just want you to know that I'm, uh, I'm really very happy for you.
You know, your face doesn't look happy for me.
Oh, really?
Huh.
That's funny.
'Cause it's really very, very happy for you, really.
In fact, my, uh, my entire body is very pleased.
Uh, you know, in the, uh in the six and a half years I've been auditing people's taxes, I'd just like you to know that yours is the best.
- Really.
- Thank you.
I've enjoyed doing you more than anybody I've, I've ever done before.
You know, that kiss in the restaurant That was no accident.
I mean, you knew that, didn't you?
- Well - We really had some great times, didn't we?
- The ice cream sticks.
Remember the ice cream sticks?
- Yes.
- And your deductible grandmother.
Remember her?
- Yes.
- And your deductible grandmother.
Remember her?
- Yes.
We really had some great times, didn't we?
- So, why are you so - So what?
- So what?
So-So tremendously depressed?
- Yeah.
The good times are over.
Th-That's all.
- They don't have to be over.
- They don't have to be over.
Come on.
Please, Mary, don't kid me, all right?
I've been in this business for a very long time.
I know that when I'm auditing people, they're just never too busy to see me.
And the minute it's over,  it's over.
So, please, you don't have to pretend, Miss Richards.
- You don't have to pretend.
- Pretend!
I didn't pretend!
I did not go out with you because of my taxes.
I mean, look, the audit is over, and I would still like to go out with you.
So, Robert, I, I must like you.
All right, how about dinner tonight?
- Fine!
- Fabulous!
Okay.
Well, I can't because I gotta work tonight.
All right, no.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am gonna quit.
That's what I'll do.
I'll quit it all, and No, I won't.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again.
U.S. Steel can just just wait.
- We have a date tonight, right?
- Yes, we do.
All right.
I'll pick you up at 8:57.
Oh, make it, uh, nine-ish.
-  - I really had a good time.
I really did.
- Oh, I did too.
- Yeah?
How much of a good time?
- What?
- I mean enough to go out next Saturday night?
Oh, yeah.
Great.
I would like to.
Wait a minute.
You know that I can't go out next Saturday night?
- No, I have to go out of town.
- Ohh.
- Well, we'll do it when you get back.
- All right.
I'm gonna be back and forth a lot.
I'm going to Boston, Philadelphia, L.A., - St. Louis, Detroit.
- Gee, that's some big company you're auditing.
No, it's a halfback on the Vikings.
How about How about the third?
Third?
Uh, yeah, fine.
Okay.
Good.
How about
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all So it ended up that we were working in the newsroom till 1:00 in the morning.
Thank goodness Mr. Grant told us not to come in till noon today.
- Did you say you wanted bacon?
- Bacon?
No.
No, just a hard-boiled egg.
Just a 70-calorie hard-boiled egg for old tubbo.
Well, maybe a little dry toast with some butter on it.
Do I smell jam?
Ladies and gentlemen, the dieter.
I'm entitled to break my diet a little.
I've been good all day.
It's 10:30 a.m.  - Who is it?
- It's Phyllis!
Why is it always Phyllis when I'm in a good mood?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Like it?
What is that?
A Christian Dior or a Marcus Welby?
What's it for?
Well, Lars's receptionist left to get married so for the past two days I've been subbing.
And it is so satisfying, Mary, I cannot tell you.
Lars's receptionist, huh?
How are things in the skin doctor game?
- Dermatology.
- Oh.
You know how it is there hectic and crazy.
Oh, the wonderful, wacky world of bad skin.
Mary, I cannot tell you how satisfying it is to be working again.
Most people would say, "Phyllis, you have everything.
What more could you want"?
And I say, " It's just not enough, being a model wife and a perfect mother".
- You know how I am.
- Mm-hmm!
We just have a hard time believing it.
I have to go to the hairdresser's.
Don't you have to be at the office?
How can you have your hair done?
Mary, it's for those patients I'm doing this.
I feel if I look my best, it gives them hope something to shoot for.
You know, I love her.
I really do.
But what is it about her?
I don't know, but I'll tell you something.
If she keeps on the way she's going, she's gonna give overbearing, aggressive women a bad name.
Total commercial billings.
Sixty ten-second spots - is, uh -  I have got to get Vi to answer this phone until I'm finished or I'm never gonna finish this!
Newsroom.
Hello.
Yes.
Yes, Vi.
I will.
I'll do that.
Right.
Vi would like me to pick up her phones while she's out to lunch.
What's lunch, Murray?
It seems so long, I've forgotten.
Can I say something to you?
I know what you're gonna say that I am working too hard and I mustn't let it upset me, and you're right, I won't.
I wasn't gonna say that.
I was gonna say, " Would you pull the picture file"?
- I need a shot of Neil Armstrong to go with this story.
- Sure.
Oh!
Hey, let me help you.
No, no.
No.
They're in alphabetical order.
Well, how do you how do you put photographs in alphabetical order?
You take the last names of the most important persons in the picture.
- Mm.
Oh, this one's tough.
- Who have you got?
The president and Joe Namath.
Oh, those two-hour Mexican lunches really take it out of you.
I think I'll go to my dressing room and have a little fiesta.
Nothing like a little nap-a-rino to pick you up.
- Kind of makes you want to cry, doesn't it?
-  Okay, everybody stop working for a minute.
Now, the program manager is so impressed with the way we muddle through a half hour of news that he's expanding the show to a full hour.
- That's terrific.
- Well.
That means a little more work from each of us for those who consider twice as much a little more.
I want you all to think about how we're gonna fill that extra half hour.
Uh  I'd like to propose that we double the airtime of this fellow right here.
Thanks, Ted.
That'll give me two whole minutes to do the weather.
Say no more, Gordo.
You don't have to tell me.
- You and I speak the same language.
-  - Right on.
- What's that?
Forget it.
Mary, I want you to give top priority to filling that extra half hour.
I figure that if I skip lunches and work overtime for the next two weeks I could maybe catch up to where I was a month ago.
- Which was?
- Three weeks behind.
There's a little extra money for all of us, not much, but No, the little extra money is not gonna help me get this work done.
- Hire an assistant.
- What I need is an assistant.
You mean it?
Sure.
Call Personnel and tell them you need somebody.
Tell them you can pay, uh $82.57 a week.
Mr. Grant, where did you get that figure?
That was the little extra money for all of us.
Rhoda, are you sure you want me to do this to your dresses, this midi thing?
- Yes.
- I just hate it.
Of course you do.
You got good legs.
I live in the world of fashion.
I do what all the magazines tell me to do.
I wore a hard hat for a week before I realized the magazine was Popular Mechanics.
That was a joke.
You're supposed to laugh.
- I'm sorry.
It's just I've got problems at the office.
- What?
-  - If I don't find somebody to help me with the extra work I'm gonna go right out of my mind.
- Hi, all.
- Hi!
So who's going out of whose mind?
I am, unless a minor miracle occurs and I find an assistant.
- An assistant?
- Yeah, to help me with some work on the show.
Why don't you just shorten her legs?
So how about me for the job?
Well, you're already working for Lars and I need somebody right now, so  I'm available.
Lars got a little upset at something I did, and he gave me the old sack.
- What did you do?
- It was nothing.
- It must've been something.
What?
- Uh Well, Lars got called out, and there were all these patients sitting there in his office, so I treated a few of them.
So, like I said, uh, I'm available.
Phyllis, look, about the job, you wouldn't be interested in it.
You don't know all the dumb things you'd have to do.
It's just It's all typing and filing and boring There are no small jobs, only small people.
But, Phyllis, you're not small enough for this job.
Mary, don't.
I'll do something else.
- Somebody's gotta want me.
- Oh, I don't know.
Phyllis!
Mary, forget it.
I don't go anyplace I'm not wanted.
Okay.
Oh, boy, Phyllis.
Okay, all right!
You want to try it for, let's say, a week?
Okay, all right, I'll try it for two weeks.
It'll be fun, a real challenge.
- I'm sure it will be.
-  - You know, it's kind of cute.
- Wha What?
- I was just thinking, it's cute, that's all.
- Yeah?
- I mean, that I have my master's degree - Yes?
And you left college after two years, and I'm your assistant.
-  - Cute.
I'm telling you, it wasn't easy in those days, those early days.
Wild-eyed kid with a dream  dream to be an anchorman.
Grabbing at Lady Luck running around helter Is Mary here yet?
Ah.
Skelter.
- It seemed at the time like reaching for the stars.
- Ted.
Your life story has been going on for a half hour now and we're just up to August 1953.
I mean, can you hurry up with the point?
It's like waiting for a sneeze.
Well, I guess I just got to reminiscing.
- Yeah.
- And I think to myself "What'd I do it for, the money"?
- Mm-mm.
- No.
The money was the least of it.
Then again, even though the money is the least of it, now that we're going to an hour You want a raise.
Is that it?
Lou I wrote a figure on this pad.
Ted, I wrote two words on this pad.
Lou I think there's a little room for negotiation between that figure and those words.
On the other hand, maybe not.
##  Phyllis, I am saying problem with your maid or no problem, this cannot happen again.
- An hour late!
- Don't do it to yourself.
Don't be a robot, tied down to schedules and clocks.
Phyllis, for the time being, let's just say that I'm a robot, huh?
- So this is the newsroom.
- Yeah, this is it.
- Morning, Gordy.
- Hi, Mary.
How are you?
Gordy, I'd like you to meet Phyllis Lindstrom, my new assistant.
- This is Gordy Howard, our weatherman.
- Phyllis.
I just want to say one thing.
I'd love you to come over for dinner so we can really get to know each other.
I mean, a-as human beings because we're going to be working together.
Yeah, uh-huh.
Gordy and I really hit it off.
- Mary!
- Morning, Murray.
I'd like you to meet my new assistant, Phyllis Lindstrom.
This is Murray Slaughter.
How do you do?
I'd love you to come over for dinner Where have you been?
Lou started yelling for you an hour ago - so I had to cover for you.
- Thank you.
What did you tell him I was doing?
Hanging up your coat.
Well, Phyllis, sit down.
You can use my desk for today.
Mary, it's not too important, but, uh there is one thing.
- What?
- Well, you've been calling me your assistant.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, that's what you are.
I mean It's just a word, Phyllis.
So is "inferior" just a word.
- Well, is there another word you would prefer?
- "Coworker".
Coworker.
All right.
- Finally find a hook for your coat, did ya?
- Oh, Mr. Grant.
l I'm very sorry.
The first day of our new production schedule, and you show up an hour late.
- I'm sure you have an absolutely great excuse.
I'm waiting.
- Well, Mr. Grant Halley's Comet hit her on her way over.
- What?
- Well, let's face it.
She could lie or make up some fabulous excuse.
Would it make her any more on time?
I leave it to you.
Mr. Grant, I would like you to meet my new coworker, Phyllis Lindstrom.
This is Mr. Grant.
-  - You mean she works here?
Uh, yes.
Good.
You're fired.
She's really just trying to be helpful in her own way.
Lou, if it'll make it up to you, I'll stay till, say oh, uh, say, uh, 6:00?
- Mary.
- Phyllis, our normal quitting time is 7:00.
This should be an interesting day for you.
A sort of combination orientation and last chance.
Okay, Phyllis, this has to go into mimeo tonight.
- Phyllis?
- Oh, yes.
What do you want me to do?
All you have to do is sort this into two piles the pink sheets and the blue sheets.
The pinks and the blues, pinks and the blues.
- Kind of like little girl babies and little boy babies.
- Uh-huh.
- And?
- That's it.
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, that's so boring.
Don't you have people who do that sort of thing?
Uh, yeah, Phyllis, I have a person who does this sort of thing you.
I know this doesn't rival working in a dermatologist's office Do you have the rubber stamp with my signature on it?
I have to autograph these pictures.
- I'm sorry, Ted.
I don't know where it is.
- Mary.
Uh, Phyllis Lindstrom, my new, uh, coworker - this is Ted Baxter.
- Hi.
Well, Ted Baxter.
How can I find the words?
I don't know.
Of course, I'm I'm thrilled and excited.
Yes, of course.
However there is something I feel compelled to say.
It has to do with the impression you make on others and the tremendous impact you have on people and how outrageously attractive you are.
- Oh, I'm boring you.
- You're not.
You're not.
Cross my heart, you're not.
Go on.
But, well, you frustrate them, Ted.
You're strong.
You're too strong, almost distant.
You know, you're the first one around here to recognize that.
Look, I have to go to the studio right now.
What are you doing here?
- Oh, just some stuff.
- Come with me.
Phyllis, how's that, uh, stuff coming?
Sorry, Mary, but I need this girl.
Well, Ted, she's supposed to be doing the filing.
She has more important things to contribute to this show than just filing some dumb blue papers.
Don't worry, Mary.
I'll do it later.
- Bye, Gordy.
- Yeah, uh-huh.
Blue.
Blue, pink blue, pink, blue, pink - I thought you hired Phyllis to do that.
- Blue.
I thought I hired Phyllis to do this too.
If she's not doing that, what is she doing?
This copy you sent down, Ted doesn't like it.
See what you can do to perk it up.
-  Perk it up?
- Uh, Phyllis?
Yes?
Murray, would you excuse Phyllis and me for just a minute, please?
Not on your life.
I want to watch you explode.
Explode?
Mary doesn't explode.
Yes, Mary does explode!
It's just that Mary has this, uh, long fuse, you see and people think that they can take advantage of her because she has this long fuse.
But, Phyllis, every once in a while, the fuse burns down, and then it just Let me understand this.
You feel I'm taking advantage of you?
Phyllis.
Look, I gave you a job.
You are supposed to be - Filing.
- Filing.
You are not supposed to be coming in here and telling She's got me so crazy, I can't think of your name.
- Murray.
- Thank you, Murray.
You are not supposed to be coming in here and telling Murray that - Ted.
- Doesn't like his copy.
That's not yourjob, Phyllis.
Yourjob is to be my assistant.
- Coworker.
- Assistant, Phyllis!
No, I am not gonna do your job for you!
You're right.
You were nice enough to give me this job and I just got swept up with the glamour of it all I mean, Ted Baxter, the lights, the cameras.
As soon as I finish up in the studio, I'll do this.
I'll stay until midnight It's all right.
No.
Go.
You can do it in the morning.
I did most of it myself anyway.
- Oh, thanks, Mary.
- Uh-huh.
- Murray, see what you can do to perk this up.
- Perk it up.
- Hi, Gordo.
- Yeah, uh-huh.
Thanks, guys.
Rockefeller, Nelson, Governor.
Rockefeller, Winthrop, Governor.
Rockefeller, David.
Rockefeller, John D., Junior.
Rockefeller, Happy.
Rockefeller Center - You're filing?
- No.
No, no.
That's, uh, Phyllis's job.
No, I was just, uh, looking for something.
Ah, here it is.
It's hard to believe that you had an urgent need for the file on Pancho Villa.
- Well, you know.
- Mm-hmm.
Come into my office.
Mary, I'm going to ask you a question and I want the truth.
How's your new assistant, Princess Margaret Rose, shaping up?
Uh, just fine.
Just fine.
Y-You know, i-it, uh it it takes a little time to, uh But she's going to.
She's, uh, gonna be just fine.
Just fine.
Of course, uh she has been spending a lot of her time with Ted in the studio.
They seem to really have hit it off I mean, to the point where you might say that she's not quite, uh doing a single bit of work around here.
Mary, you could use a little fatherly advice.
The fatherly advice is, why'd you hire her?
Well, that's a hard one to explain, Mr. Grant.
- She's a crackerjack typist?
- Oh, n-n She's a great organizer?
A whiz at shorthand?
She helped me find my apartment.
Ah!
Rule number one: Don't hire friends.
I hired a friend once.
You know what happened?
Worked out great.
But that's me.
You can't handle it.
I know.
I can't handle Phyllis.
I've known her for years, and she's just she's Well, she's very intelligent, you know, and, uh Let me put it this way.
If Phyllis were drowning, her life wouldn't flash before her eyes.
Eleanor Roosevelt's life would flash before her eyes.
She's - Lou, can I see you a minute?
- No, I'm busy.
- Oh.
-  What he say?
- What he say?
- He's busy.
He's busy?
Use your strength.
Try it again.
All right.
Lou?
You and I are gonna have a little talk.
-  What do you want?
- I want her here.
Ted, I'm too busy to play games.
Well, all right.
I'll just talk to the general manager.
All right, Ted.
Let's talk.
Uh, Phyllis, I think you and I have some filing to do.
Remember when we had that little discussion yesterday?
That figure is still in my mind, and this time you're not gonna talk me out of it.
What's more, not only do I want that raise we discussed but I also want some new writers on the show.
Now, Phyllis here tells me this Norman Mailer fellow's pretty good.
And if he's not available, how about this Truman "Capot"?
- "E".
- Oh, yes, that's right.
Truman E. "Capot".
Loo  Look, Ted No, Lou, you look.
Either I get what I want, or I don't go on tonight.
Mary, would you get me the file on available anchormen and their phone numbers?
- I may need somebody tonight.
- Yes, sir.
He's bluffing.
You're bluffing, Lou.
Trying to pull the old bluff-a-rino, eh?
But it won't work.
Here they are.
I think they're up to date, so almost any of them should be available.
You're trying to bluff me, too, eh, Mar?
I'll tell you, it won't work, Lou.
I want that raise, and I want it fast.
- Let's try him first.
- Yes, sir.
Who are you gonna dial, Mar, the weather report?
Bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff, bluff.
- Hello.
This is Mr. Lou Grant's office at W -  I think I have some filing to do.
All right, all right.
I didn't say I needed those things I want.
I just said I wanted to talk about it and I talked about it.
- Who were you calling?
- Uh, it's gonna be fair and warmer.
Mary, she is dangerous.
She's actually got Baxter convinced he's capable of human thought.
Mary, you've got to - Keep her away from Ted Baxter.
- No.
- Give her a good talking to?
- No.
- Fire her?
- That's it.
It seems a little barbaric, doesn't it, putting candy out to fire somebody?
Melts in your mouth, not in your unemployment line.
She was so awful at work today, but it just See, I know it's because underneath that confidence she's really a mass of insecurity, you know?
- How am I gonna tell her I have to let her go?
- I don't know.
- But you'll think of something.
You're good at that.
-  - It's me.
- Oh.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Good luck.
- Good luck?
What for?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing.
Uh, listen.
Uh, Phyllis, I have some coffee in the kitchen.
Would you like some?
- No.
I had a cup downstairs.
- You're fired.
l-I didn't say that.
Phyllis, it just slipped out.
I just l  Phyllis, sit down.
Phyllis, I am so sorry I said that, but At least I said it.
At least now it's out.
And the important thing to remember here is that not everybody is right for every job.
I knew it.
I kept telling myself, "Phyllis," I said, "dress dowdy".
Wh- What?
Dress dowdy.
"Sure," I said, "Mary's a pleasant-looking single girl "even a a nice-looking single girl.
But you know how touchy career gals get when you're married and they're not".
Phyllis, what does your being married and my being not have to do with this?
Nothing.
We'll just say you fired me because I'm not right for the job, okay?
- Want to say that?
- Phyllis.
No, we'll say that.
I'll tell Lars.
He'll get such a howl out of it.
Don't worry, Mary.
It doesn't matter, really.
Really.
Lars and I have fantastic plans for tonight.
You know how married people are.
- Oh?
Where are you going?
- Oh, we're staying home.
Phyllis, will you please stop apologizing?
I can't help it.
I mean, I've been just dumb and awful.
I deserve being fired.
And I took it so badly when you told me you had to let me go.
This just really is not necessary.
I just want you to know I know I did a lousy job.
I didn't do the filing, and I came in late all the time, and I got Lou mad at you and I caused dissension in the office, and I just generally didn't do my job.
- And that's all I'm gonna say.
- Good.
Now, will you sign this?
- What is it?
- A letter of recommendation.
"To whom it may concern.
Phyllis Lindstrom is dependable, efficient, prompt - Just put your signature on it.
- " tactful, takes direction well  "organized mature attitude"

How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all  Hi, Phyllis.
I'm sorry.
I don't have time to talk.
I'm late for work.
- Do you have a few minutes and a cup of coffee?
- I'm really in kind of a hurry.
Oh.
Well, then just make it instant.
But, Phyllis, you don't understand.
In a couple of minutes, I'm gonna be late for work.
Uh, no, I'm not.
I am.
- Uh, what is it?
- Mary, I'm in a real bind.
I've got a deadline, and you've just gotta help me.
- What do you need?
- A cup of coffee and Ted Baxter.
- Ted Baxter?
- Yes.
To give a talk for my club.
I'm in charge of guest speakers, and I don't have any guest speaker for tonight.
- So can you help me out?
- Tonight?
But that's tonight.
I know.
I guess you're entitled to the whole story.
Uh, we had Dr. Herman Davis lined up you know, the controversial psychiatrist who wrote that great book, Don't Be Embarrassed About S-E-X.
Ah.
But he, uh, he backed out.
He decided at the last minute he was uncomfortable with women.
Well, Phyl, I don't know.
Ted's not very good at that sort of thing.
But, Mary, it's just talking.
Yeah, well, it's just talking that Ted's not very good at.
Mary, if I were in your position, you know that I would do anything I could to help me.
- Yeah.
- But I can see it's just too much trouble.
Well, Phyllis, listen.
Let's just say -  - that I could get Ted to talk, how long would you need him?
- I'd need him to talk 15 minutes.
-  Well, I suppose I could get Murray to write something for him.
Oh, great!
Oh, great!
Our subject for tonight is "The World Today".
- Uh-huh.
- Never mind the coffee, Mary.
I'm really in a hurry.
You really helped me.
I just wish there were something I could do for you.
Phyllis, the only thing I need is to get to work.
Listen, my car is in the shop.
Do you think you could drive me to work?
- Oh, sure!
- Oh, thank you.
Let's see.
It's 20 minutes there, 20 minutes back.
- If it's really that important to you.
- Well, it would help.
It'll take me 15 minutes to get ready, but if you really want me to - Well, no.
Forget it, really.
- Well, I'll postpone things.
I'll move things around.
- No, Phyl, please.
Don't postpone anything.
- I'll drop them if necessary.
- Thanks anyway.
- Don't mention it.
What are friends for?
- Murray, is the coffee ready yet?
- No, not yet, Lou.
No coffee?
We usually have coffee by 9:00, and it's already It's How come it's always the Minneapolis clock that's on the blink?
Maybe it's because that's the clock we use all the time, Lou.
I mean, if the Tokyo clock stopped, who'd notice?
I need coffee.
He almost made sense to me.
- Does anybody here know how to work this machine?
- I can do it.
Uh, where do you put the dime?
It's not that kind of machine.
- Well, then I can't do it.
-  - Good morning, everybody.
- Hi, Mar.
Do you realize that if the clock was working, you'd be late?
- I'm sorry, Mr. Grant.
- Don't apologize now.
- Go make coffee now.
You can apologize later.
- Coffee, right, right.
- Hi, Ted.
I'm glad to see you.
- Coffee, coffee, coffee.
- Coffee, coffee, yes.
Does anyone have a dime?
- Uh see?
I need it to open the cabinet.
The handle's broken.
Ted, I've got a favor to ask of you.
- You remember my friend, Phyllis Lindstrom?
- Mmm.
Well, she is in charge of the guest speakers for her club, and she was wondering whether or not you would make a speech at her club.
- It's a women's club.
- Well, if they wanted me, I assumed it was a women's club.
Well, gee, I don't know what to say, Mar.
I mean, I'm Well, I, uh "I'd love to".
- Oh, Ted, thank you.
- Oh, it's nothing.
You know, this could be a very interesting experience.
I mean, talking in front of all those people in person, I mean.
Now I'll be able to actually hear their applause instead of just knowing it's there.
Ted, I don't know how to break this to you, but I don't think people sit at home at night applauding the 6:00 news.
- Murray - Oh, I know just what you're gonna say.
Would you write a speech for Ted?
Oh, Mary, I, l "I'd love to".
Ah, thank you, Murray.
Mar, uh, when do those ladies want me to speak?
Uh, well, tonight.
- Tonight?
- Yeah.
Well, that doesn't give me much time for him to prepare.
Well, what is Ted supposed to talk about tonight?
Oh, what difference does it make?
They'll love me.
I've gotten cheers by just simply cutting a ribbon at a supermarket opening.
That's because they didn't think you could do it.
- What the heck am I gonna talk about?
- Well I have this wonderfully amusing anecdote about  what happened to me when I bought this suit.
Uh, no, Ted.
I think what they want is your personal view of the world situation.
He doesn't have one.
What they're gonna get is my view of his personal view of the world situation.
So all those ladies wanted me?
Well, I'd better get to work.
I've got to write today's news, Ted's speech and finish my novel before 6:00.
Murray, I didn't know you were writing a novel.
Reading one.
- Oh.
-  Newsroom.
Oh, hi, Phyl.
Yes, it's all set for tonight.
Ted'll be there.
No, forget it.
You don't owe me a thing.
No, really, Phyl.
You don't owe me anything.
Well, I'll tell you, there is one thing.
I could use a ride home tonight about 7:00.
Oh, right, of course, the meeting.
How could I forget that?
No, no, don't not have your hair done, Phyl, really.
Yeah, I know.
The buses leave every 24 minutes.
Yes, Ted will be there.
Bye-bye.
- Ted will be where?
- Oh, well, I just arranged for Ted to speak at a women's club.
Mary, do me a favor.
Next time you do something like this, you ask my permission first.
Wait, no, no.
I'll save you the trouble.
Next time, the answer will be no.
Oh, well, okay, Mr. Grant.
But wh-why?
Mary, a karate expert's hands can get him in a lot of trouble.
Yeah, but what does that have to do with Ted?
Those hands are considered a deadly weapon.
It's the same with Ted's mouth.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Were you waiting to see somebody?
- I'm waiting to see Miss Richards.
- I'm Miss Richards.
- Are you Miss Richards?
- Yes.
I'm Dave Curson.
I'm a publicity man.
You've probably heard of me.
No, I can't say that I have.
Oh.
I'm gonna have to work on that.
- Well, uh, would you like to sit down?
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh.
- That's - What can I do for you?
- Well, I saw your name on the board downstairs, and it said you were associate producer of the news.
- Congratulations.
- Well, thank you.
I thought you'd be the person to see about getting some publicity.
You see, I thought if I could get some of my clients on your news program, it would really help my business a lot.
Oh.
Well, I think probably the man you should see is Lou Grant.
- He's in charge of the news.
- Was that Mr. Grant who just left?
- Yes.
- I don't think I'm ready for Mr. Grant yet.
I know what you mean.
So, uh, who are some of your clients?
You've heard of the Midwestern Yo-Yo Association?
Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Curson, I don't see how a news program could help publicize yo-yos.
I guess you're right.
Well, look, here's my card.
If you ever need any publicity for the station, just give me a call.
Oh, Mr. Curson, uh, the telephone number here is crossed out.
Oh, I know that.
You see, the printer made a mistake on the phone number, so I got 'em for half price.
If he'd left my name off, I probably could've got 'em for nothing.
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye.
- Is this a "pull"?
It's a "pull"?
- Yes, it's - Uh, Mar?
- Yes, Ted?
About tonight.
Do you think I ought to wear my dark blue suit or my tux?
Oh, I think the blue suit will be fine.
- Okay.
Mary?
- Yes?
I was just wondering I mean, if you're through with it - Yes?
- Could I have my dime back?
-  - Who is it?
-  - Who is it?
It's me Phyllis.
- Wh- What's the matter?
- "What's the matter"?
- Yeah.
Is there something wrong?
- "Is there something wrong"?
Phyllis, will you stop repeating everything I say and tell me what's the matter!
Wait a minute.
Ted.
Your club.
How did, uh It didn't go well, did it?
Well, it didn't go at all.
It just laid there.
Mary, you could at least have warned me that he's never spoken in public before.
Phyllis, I did.
I told you What happened?
Well, he wasn't so bad in the beginning when he was reading his speech.
I mean, at least he finished.
- We applauded.
It was all very nice.
- And?
And then Helen Edwards asked him a question.
Wa- Was it a hard question?
Well, yes, it was.
It was, " Are you for or against women's liberation"?
Uh-oh.
Was he for it or against it?
Well, we don't know.
He just stood there with his mouth open, like he was going to say something.
And then a sort of glaze came over his eyes, he giggled a couple of times, said something nobody understood and then he asked if there were any more questions.
- And were there?
- Well, yes.
There were about an hour's worth of questions and two minutes' worth of answers.
Poor Ted.
He must feel just awful.
Why don't you ask him?
- Well, I would, but it's a little late for calls - He's standing out in the hall.
In my hall?
He didn't want to come in unless he had a personal invitation from you.
- Do you want to invite him in?
- Well, of course I do.
Ted, uh, why don't you come in?
I don't know.
Well, uh, would you like to come in?
I'm not sure.
Could you phrase that so it's not a question?
He seems to take orders rather well.
- Ted, get in here.
- Yes, Mary.
- Can I take your coat?
- Another question!
I don't know.
I just don't know.
Hello, Mr. Grant?
It's me.
Mary.
Mary Richards.
Oh, not much.
What's, uh, new with you?
Well, yes, Mr. Grant, I do have a very good reason for calling you at 1:00 in the morning.
- I don't know how to say this - Why don't you just say it?
I guess I'll just say it.
Mr. Grant, a little while ago Ted dropped by, and he was kind of upset and Mr. Grant, Ted's locked himself in my bathroom, and he won't come out.
- So then what happened, Ted?
- So everything was going fine.
They were attentive, laughing at what I was saying.
Then I realized I wasn't saying anything funny.
I should have worn my tux.
Somehow you don't laugh at a man when he's wearing a tux.
I don't know.
I just think you're blowing this whole thing way out of proportion.
No, he's not, Mary.
I was there.
But what does it matter if a few women laugh?
How many could there have been?
- Twenty-five.
- Two hundred.
Actually, we're both right.
There were 200 when he started.
Mary, come into my office.
We're, uh, just going to make coffee.
They're just going to make coffee.
- Ted needs a drink.
- Oh, well, Mr. Grant, - I really don't think that Ted's in any shape - Mary.
Mary.
Mary.
- What, Mr. Grant?
- When a man's in that kind of shape, he doesn't need milk and cookies.
- I've got some brandy.
- Another glass, please.
I never like to see anybody drink alone, unless it's me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
When I was a kid, the whole family used to practically live in the kitchen.
- I've got to get going.
- I just got rattled.
I didn't know they were going to ask hard questions.
I tried to help him out by asking a question that I was sure he could answer.
I asked him where he bought his suit.
How was I supposed to know?
I own three suits.
Ted, why didn't you just open up your coat and read your label?
Oh, sure.
It's easy to second-guess.
Everybody's a Monday morning quarterback.
I'm telling you, Lou, I can't do it.
I've lost my charisma.
Whatever that is.
Ted, you know, I know just how you feel.
- I was humiliated once.
- You were?
Oh, yeah.
It was a high school play, and we were doing Romeo and.
Juliet, and Well, you know the big scene, the final scene when Romeo thinks that I'm dead?
And I was lying out there, and Romeo was standing over me.
And he had just plunged the dagger into himself, and I suddenly had to sneeze.
I tried as h-hard as I could not to sn-sn-sneeze.
And I did.
I sneezed, and Romeo looked down and said, "Gesundheit".
And I looked up and ad-libbed, "Thank you".
Oh, it was awful!
A high school play, Mary.
It's not the same thing.
Oh, but no, Ted.
My mother and father were sitting in the audience.
So were mine.
They were the first to leave.
Ted, my point is that I survived, and so will you.
Thanks, Mary, for trying to make me feel good.
I wish you were better at it.
I think I'll I'll go home now.
Ted, you're not going home.
- He isn't?
- I'm not?
No.
You're coming with me.
I have a guest room.
I'll drive you to work in the morning.
It'll be nice.
Thanks, Lou.
I love you for that.
- Good night, Mar.
- Good night, Ted.
You know, Mr. Grant, that's really very, very nice.
What's nice?
It's the only way I can guarantee he'll show up for work.
Besides, it's a great excuse to get my wife out of the guest room.
That was the senator making that statement at the airport today.
Ladies and gentlemen, a serious "warming" from uh, warning from the University of Minnesota's "asphosmerics" Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
Atmospherics department.
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
l Dale Wick, head of the department of atmo of that department announced that in five years, smog could reach "legal" proportions.
What?
Oh.
Lethal proportions.
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
I seem to be having a little trouble.
I'm, uh, just sorry.
And now for the lighter side of the news.
The "populotion explusion" Oh, Lord, I'm sorry.
Mary, get in here!
- Yes, Mr. Grant?
- Sit down, Mary.
The rating book came in for this week.
Take a look at the 6:00 news rating.
We went up!
That's right.
Do you know why?
I'll tell you.
Because people are tuning in to laugh at Ted Baxter.
Or as he might put it, "Bed Taxter".
He's become the thing to do.
We're starting to catch on, Mary.
But I don't want that.
I don't want to do a successful comedy show with Mr. Blooper.
I'd rather do an unsuccessful news show.
Is that too much to ask, Mary?
Mr. Grant, are you trying to say that I am to blame for this?
I mean, all right, I admit I got Ted involved in that women's club, but I really don't see how that makes all of this my fault.
- Sit down.
- I didn't Maybe, Mary, you haven't noticed this about me before, but I'm one of the few people in my field who doesn't have a peptic ulcer.
And one of the reasons for that is that I'm able to delegate blame.
Nothing that goes wrong here is my fault.
It's Ted's fault.
It's Murray's fault.
It's Gordy's fault.
This is your fault.
- It is, isn't it?
- So fix it before it begins to look like it's my fault!
This is Ted Baxter saying good "nise" and good "nute".
- What was going on in there?
- Oh, you don't want to hear about it.
I already did.
- Hi, Ted.
- You're just saying that to make me feel good.
Hey, look, Ted, it was my fault.
It was a slow news day.
I just couldn't write anything exciting for you to read.
A revolution in South America, a crisis in the Far East and an earthquake in Peru.
No, Murray, it's not the news.
It's me.
I've lost something.
Has anyone seen my hat?
I think it's under Mary's coat.
Ted, it's nighttime.
I know.
I'm just not in the mood to be recognized.
- Excuse me.
Aren't you - No, I'm not.
I used to be.
He still looks a lot like him.
Hi, Miss Richards.
- Oh, hi.
- Remember me?
- Sure.
You're, um Dave Curson.
- Dave Curson.
You remembered.
Well, it looks like you're busy.
I'll come back.
No, I wasn't, really.
I was just about to close up shop.
- What can I do for you?
- Well, you see, I had this idea.
And, uh, it's probably not a very good one.
No, it's no good.
Mr. Curson, why don't you let me hear the idea?
Oh, well, it was an idea I had for the Midwestern Yo-Yo Association.
You see, they're having their Midwestern Yo-Yo Championships this Sunday, and I thought your announcer, Paul Price, could accept their Man of the Year award.
Then maybe he'd announce it on the But it's not a very good idea.
Never mind.
- Uh, Mr. Curson, I wouldn't say that.
- You wouldn't?
I think I could get everyone on the station yo-yos too.
There's just one problem.
You see, Paul Price is gonna be covering the hockey game.
- See, I didn't think - No, wait a minute.
What if we could get Ted Baxter?
- Oh, Miss Richards, do you think you could?
- Good night, Mar.
Murray, do you think we could get Ted to accept a Man of the Year award?
Oh, sure.
But who'd be dumb enough to give him one?
- The Midwestern Yo - Yo Association.
Oh.
Ted Baxter, Mr. Yo-Yo.
Well, the shoe certainly fits.
Anybody got the correct time in Minneapolis?
Subtract 15 hours from Tokyo and add a day.
Thanks.
- Good morning, Mr. Grant.
Can I help you with those?
- Good morning.
Uh, yeah.
I want you to answer these letters.
- Fan mail?
- Not exactly.
"Dear Sir: The 6:00 news is an insult to my intelligence "and a disgrace to television.
"I am not going to watch the show anymore, and neither are my mommy and daddy".
Did you ever get a hate letter written in crayon?
Mr. Grant, have you seen Ted this morning?
I think I might have some good news.
My good news is I haven't seen Ted this morning.
- Oh, Lou.
- Ohh.
- Got to see you about a couple of things.
- What is it, Ted?
First of all, there were no bath towels in my dressing room again.
There's no bath in your dressing room.
That's the second thing I want to see you about.
Whoever heard of an anchorman's dressing room without a bath?
I want you to get on that right away, Lou.
After all, it's not too much to ask for.
I understand Cronkite's got a sauna.
How'd you do it?
I got 600 people to give him an award and all Ted had to say was, "Thank you".
Well, it sure worked.
Ted's back in shape, and we certainly needed him back in shape.
Ted's his old self again.
He sure is.
You understand, of course, why I can't bring myself to thank you for that.
- Hi, Miss Richards.
- Hi, Dave Curson.
Dave Curson.
Remember me?
Yeah.
- I got Ted Baxter's award back from the engraver.
- Ohh.
- The towels are real nice, Lou.
Thanks.
- You're welcome, Ted.
Maybe the next time, you can get me some cloth ones.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-  Uh, Ted?
Your award came back from the engravers, and Dave wanted to present it to you.
- Oh.
- Good luck.
Oh, isn't it lovely!
What does it say, Ted?
"To Ted Baxter".
Read the rest of it, Ted.
"Yo-Yo Man of the Year".
Got any more of these little award things?
As a matter of fact, I do.
I have another group here.
It's the Minneapolis Association of Shoe Repairmen.

Merry Christmas to you too.
Bye-bye.
- Good morning, Mr. Grant.
-  The only thing missing is an electric train.
You got the Nativity scene in your drawer?
- That's incredible!
- I haven't had time to set it up, but I thought it would look very nicely on the filing cabinet.
- I was kidding.
- Mr. Grant, uh, I don't suppose there's any chance I could get off early Christmas Eve, is there?
You see, I'm gonna drive up and spend Christmas Day with my family.
Mary, come into my office.
Mary, the thing I wanted to talk to you Well, it's Christmas.

- Sit down.
You know, Mary, I haven't had Christmas off in seven years.
- Oh, that's terrible.
- Well, it's not too bad.
You get used to it.
Christmas is just like any other day when you work in a newsroom.
- You know what I mean?
- Um, no.
Oh.
You gotta work on Christmas.
I've gotta work on Christmas?
Well, that's another way of putting it.
Mr. Grant, I just I never thought that I would be working on Christmas.
I'd better go call my mom.
She's sentimental about Christmas.
I have a feeling that when I go to sleep tonight, three ghosts are going to visit me.
Rhoda, aren't you gonna help me decorate at all?
Uh-uh.
I just decorated an entire department store.
Hey, Mary, why don't you hang up pantyhose?
- They hold more.
- I never thought of that.
-  -  Mary, hurry up!
- Hi.
- Help me!
Ah.
What Ooh.
You know, the wonderful thing about living in Minnesota We always have a white Christmas.
The thing that gets me is the white Easters.
I never saw so much stuff.
I can't help myself.
I'm just a Christmas nut.
Not just Christmas.
I'm sure you feel the same way about  Chanukah, Rhoda.
Oh, sure, sure.
Chanukah, Christmas, they're all the same.
Mary, do you mind if I leave Bess's gifts here?
I don't want her to find them.
- She's been hunting around the apartment since Halloween.
- Oh, sure.
- Wait till you see this stuff.
It's fantastic.
- Did you get anything for me?
Not exactly what I wanted.
It's a one-quarter scale transparent figure with all the intestines.
It's very educational, also.
Hey, Mary, don't you wish they had this kind of stuff when we were kids?
Mm.
Oh, Rhoda, look.
Oh, now, she is adorable.
- Oh!
- This doll is some dresser!
I've been looking for a pair of shoes like this all winter.
She's cute.
Isn't she darling?
- Is she a talking doll?
- No.
Oh, too bad.
I was hoping she could tell me where she got those shoes.
-  - What are you getting for Lars?
Hey, he's a doctor.
Why don't you give him this thing with the intestines?
Yeah.
That is for him.
- Oh.
Here.
- Do you, uh, have any idea what he's giving you?
He told me I could pick my own gift this year.
I picked cash.
I'll be back up tomorrow to wrap these.
Merry Christmas!
- Yeah, you too.
- Bye.
Oh, wow, this is gonna be some weird Christmas.
- What do you mean, Mar?
- Well, my apartment's all decorated, I got presents under the tree, and I'm not gonna be here to enjoy it.
- I'll be working.
- That's it, cheer yourself up.
But let me tell you something.
When I was a little girl, we used to drive up to my grandparents' every Christmas.
And on the way, we'd pass this diner, and there'd be these little old men having their Christmas dinner alone.
And it's just that this year, I'm gonna be one of those little old men.
You know, I came down here because I was a little depressed, but said to myself, "Mary will cheer me up".
Hey, I got an idea.
I don't have to work Christmas Eve.
- Why don't you and I celebrate it together?
- I don't know, Mar.
I get the feeling that Christmas Eve with you could be pretty grim.
No, come on!
I'll be good.
I promise.
We'll light the tree, build a fire, have some eggnog and open our presents.
What do you say?
- You're on.
- Good.
- Does this mean we're gonna exchange gifts?
- It wouldn't be a bad idea.
- Uh, did you get mine yet?
- Yeah.
- What is it?
- Rhoda, you're not supposed to ask that.
How about a hint?
Mary, I'm very competitive.
- I want to get you something better.
- Get out of here.
That's not exactly the Christmas spirit, fella.
That's not what I'd call the Christmas spirit.
- No, sir, that is not the Christmas spirit.
- Well, what's wrong, Ted?
They're just rubbing it in down the hall because they're having a Christmas party.
- Who's having a party?
- Everybody except us.
In particular, that darned Chuckles the Clown.
Hey, Clown, you're not funny!
I don't know why we can't have a Christmas party.
Oh, yes, you do.
It's because of what you did last year.
- What did you do, Ted?
- I don't remember.
I go to a lot of parties.
I don't know everything.
- What did he do?
- Oh, you know how it is.
You get a few drinks in you, and you feel like telling off the boss.
- Except he did it on the air.
- You're kidding.
- You mean, he actually told you off on the air?
- No, he didn't tell me off.
- Well, who then?
- The president.
- Of the United States?
- Of America.
- But why?
- Well, he sent the president a Christmas card and got mad because he didn't get one back.
- Hi, Fred.
- Hiya, Fred.
How you doing?
Why don't you ask me New Year's Eve?
I have to work then too.
What Murray, we said we weren't going to exchange presents.
Oh, I know, but, well, I felt so bad about you not being able to get home.
- I hope you like it.
- Oh, but, Murray, the point is, we did discuss it, and we decided no presents.
Oh, well, I just I don't know what to say except here's yours.
- Oh, gee, Mary, you shouldn't have.
- I know.
Listen, Murray, don't feel badly about me.
Rhoda and I are gonna have dinner together tonight, open some presents Rhoda and I are gonna have dinner together tonight, open some presents Ho-ho-ho!
The silver Santa's here.
Right now, I have personalized gifties for each one of my little elves.
- Lou.
- Gee, I wonder what it is.
It's either a record album or a very stiff handkerchief.
Fred.
Mary.
- Thanks for the tie, Mar.
- Oh, you're welcome, Ted.
I hope it fits.
-  Harlan.
- Why don't we just file by and help ourselves?
There's a way of doing these things, Murr.
Avery.
He's the only man I know that can make Christmas seem like mail call.
- Murray.
- Yo.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
- Oh, this is terrific!
- I'm glad you like it, Lou.
Yes.
"The Year in Review, as Told by Ted Baxter.
" I had the engineers make it up.
It's a compilation of my best stuff.
I'm surprised you needed an LP.
- Mary.
- Oh, thank you.
I heard about you not being able to go home for Christmas after planning to and all.
Yeah, it was a little disappointing, but everybody here has the same problem, you know, or one like it.
Look at you.
It's Christmas Eve, and you have to work tonight.
Well, I just want you to know that tomorrow, when you're working and I'm at home, I'll be thinking about you.
Oh, thank you, Fred.
That's very nice.
And I guess tonight, when I'm working and you're at home, you'll be thinking about me.
Well, I will now.
You know, I just thought of something.
When somebody's got a big family like I have, it seems a shame not to share it.
- So I was wondering - Yes?
- Would you work for me tonight?
- Would l Look, Mary, I wouldn't ask you if you were going home to your family.
But what's Christmas Eve to you?
You're gonna be all alone.
I'll trade you.
I'll work New Year's Day for you.
That way, you'll be able to watch all the football games.
Fred, I have l Look, Mary, please.
I've never spent Christmas Eve with my kids.
Oh, Fred, that last part wasn't fair.
I know, but I'm desperate.
Mary, will you work for me tonight?
- All right, yes.
- Ah, thanks.
Will you at least cover for me while I go home and have some dinner?
Oh, sure, sure.
And, uh, Mary, I just want you to know I feel terrible about this.
Good.
-  - Who is it?
Ho, ho, ho!
- Come on in, Rhoda.
- Hi.
I'm not coming in yet because I have this big package out here, so big that I had to open the door first.
Now I am bringing this big package into your apartment, and I am placing it under your tree.
No, I'm not.
I can't stand it.
You gotta open it now, Mary.
- Rhoda!
- Come on.
- It's for me?
- Yeah, for you.
Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.
Should I open it now?
- Yeah.
Go on.
- It looks like somebody already opened it.
- I did.
I opened it a few times to take a look at this fantastic gift.
Oh, Rhoda!
- Oh, it's just - Isn't it great?
- It's Oh, well - Listen, let me break you in on it.
You'll be able to get your license and then solo in no time.
- Miss Richards, this is your griddle area, - Yes.
if you wish to fry an egg.
- Yes.
- Then, of course, here is your rotisserie, - if you wish to barbecue an egg.
- Uh-huh.
Then we have the oven for your basic baked eggs.
- Yes.
What's this?
- That's your egg.
- I knew it.
- Well, Mary, what do you think?
Rhoda, I think it is just wonderful, and I think you spent too much money.
Don't worry.
I got an employee's discount down at the store.
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Yeah.
Well, I have yours, and it's not half as nice.
- Forty percent as nice?
- Well - It's not too big, is it?
I'm kidding.
-  Oh, this is fun.
Oh, Mary, it's gorgeous!
And you paid full price, right?
- I did.
- Oh!
Hey, you know what this'll go great with?
My new suit.
Well, you think this is an accident?
Why do you think I picked it out?
Oh, kid, thanks.
I love it.
Hey, me too.
Thanks.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.
Hey, you know what else my new blouse will go great with?
- What?
Huh?
- Your rotisserie.
I can wear it while you cook a turkey in there.
I bought one for us for tonight.
I'll go get it.
Rhoda, wait.
Listen, how fast do you think that thing can cook a turkey?
- Why?
- Because I have to leave for the office in ten minutes.
- For what?
- To work.
- What?
- I traded with a man so that he could be with his - I don't even want to go into it.
- Terrific.
Wonderful.
You get me hyped up for Christmas Eve, and then you run out like this.
What am I supposed to do?
Stand out in the snow and light matches?
Rhoda, will you please This has been a rough week, and the worst part is just about to begin.
- Okay, kid, listen.
I'll see you later tonight.
- I have to work till midnight.
Oh.
Well, then I'll see you tomorrow.
I can't.
I'm working tomorrow.
It's Christmas.
Well, uh, have a merry Christmas.
You too.
And now this final Yuletide item.
We have just received word from a U.S. radar base in northernmost Alaska that an unusual flying object's been sighted: a sleigh with eight tiny reindeer.
Piloting the vehicle, a man who was overheard to say "Ho, ho, ho".
Anyone knowing the identity of this man, please contact the nearest child.
This is Ted Baxter saying merry Christmas to you and yours from me and mine.
- Murray, did you write that last part?
- No.
As a matter of fact, that's the only news story Ted ever wrote in his life.
He does it every year.
He even had thousands of copies printed up for people who write in requesting it.
He still has thousands of copies.
Well, I better get going.
- Merry Christmas.
- You too.
Oh, Mary!
How could you let Fred talk you into working Christmas Eve?
I mean, it's bad enough you can't go home.
But working tonight!
It's all right.
Look, Fred has a family to spend the evening with.
Oh, his family isn't so great.
They bought an aluminum tree this year.
- Oh, Murray.
- Well, Mary, I guess I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Mary!
There's not much for you to check tonight.
Everything's pretty quiet.
Yeah, I know.
Typical Christmas Eve.
Uh there's an envelope for you on the desk there.
- Who's it from?
- Me.
"The crystal bells of Christmas bring love and cheer tonight to wish for you"  Oh, Mr. Grant, I really Well, I don't know what to buy a girl.
Get yourself something.
Mr. Grant, I can't accept this.
- Sure, you can.
- But a blank check!
What?
Huh?
Give me that.
That's a mistake.
Why don't I, uh, just wait outside while you No, no.
All I have to do is fill in an amount here.
Can I have the card back, please?
- You want the envelope too?
- If you don't mind.
And da-da.
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you, Mr. Grant.
Uh, Mary, it's none of my business why you're working for Fred on Christmas Eve, but Yes, it is, Mr. Grant.
You're head of the newsroom.
No, I don't want it to be my business.
Because if it is, then I have to feel responsible for you being here all alone.
Oh, Mr. Grant, thank you, but I'm not gonna be alone.
- The cleaning crew will be coming around.
- No, they won't.
- They don't work on Christmas Eve.
- There's the night watchman.
Uh-uh.
There's only one man on duty tonight, and he has to stay downstairs in the lobby.
Well, it's comforting to know that there'll be somebody only 12 floors away.
Look, I got some paperwork I can do.
I'll stay.
You go on home.
No, Mr. Grant.
It would make it a lot easier on me if everyone would just stop feeling sorry for me and go home and have a merry Christmas.
- Okay, okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Take care of yourself.
- Well, you too.
- Good night.
- Good night.
So.
##  ##  ##  ##   Hello there!
Hello.
Hello!
Hey, Fred, you there?
I got a great joke for you.
Hey, Fred, now, don't mess around.
This is really a great story I got.
- Hello?
- Fred?
No.
I'm filling in for him tonight.
Who is this?
- Charlie.
- Oh, hi, Charlie.
Charlie, I don't know what this is connected to.
- Where are you?
- Out at the transmitter.
- I'm Charlie.
You've heard of me.
- Oh.
Yes, Charlie, out at the transmitter.
Right.
Well, well.
How is the transmitter?
Sort of quiet tonight.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I'm all alone here too.
- Well, so long.
- Well, wait!
Charlie, can't we talk or something?
What about?
Well, you said you had a good joke.
Oh, yeah.
There were these two guys, and they're walking down this big alley, and - What's your name again?
- Uh, Mary.
I can't tell it to you.
Well, c-can't we talk about something else?
I don't know what to say to you.
I've never spoken to you before.
Charlie, do you have any family?
Nothing but.
Four kids, nine grandkids.
Gee, I bet you wish you could be with them tonight, huh?
I will be in about 15 minutes.
The whole family's meeting over at my son Paul's place.
Every year, we have a real old-fashioned Christmas.
He'll get the kids up, and they'll open up some of their presents.
Do you have any family?
Well, uh, not tonight I don't.
No.
It was really nice talking to you, Charlie.
Same here, and merry Christmas.
You too.
Over and out.
Merry Christmas.
Newsroom.
-  - Hello?
He-Hello?
Hello, Rhoda.
Listen, there's not supposed to be anyone in the building, and I just heard the elevator.
Rhoda, I can't call the police.
What am I gonna tell them?
That I heard an elevator?
I can't call the police until the murderer gets off the elevator.
-  - There he is.
He's off the elevator.
And he's brought his gang.
Rhoda, listen, you were my best friend, and I really liked your Christmas present.
Surprise!
- I hope we didn't scare you.
- Oh!
We were gonna call you, but Ted wanted it to be a surprise.
Were you surprised?
- Was I surprised?
-  - Oh!
- Hello.
Newsroom.
Season's greetings.
- Mr. Grant - What do you mean, is this the murderer?
- Ted, that's for me.
- You're the murderer?
Rhoda, yes, everything's fine.
Yes, of course I'm sure.
No, nobody's forcing me to say that.
No, it's just Mr. Grant and Ted and Murray.
- I don't know why they're here.
- We're having a Christmas party.
They're having a Christmas party.
No, no, no.
We're having a Christmas party.
- All of us.
- We are!
Yes.
Hey, why don't you come down?
All right, we'll see you in a little while.
Merry Christmas to you too.
Bye.
Oh, Mr. Grant.
- Oh, Murray, thank you very much.
- Mary.
Oh, Ted, thank you, thank you.
Oh, Ted, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's just so good to see you.
- Come on, Mary.
The party's at my place.
- Okay, I'll get my coat.
- Hey, wait a minute.
You're not off till midnight.
- Oh, come on, Lou.
- It's Christmas Eve.
What's the difference?
- The difference is that the general manager has a habit of calling at two minutes to midnight to wish the night man a merry Christmas.
- If the night man isn't here - You mean we have to kill a half hour here?
Well, let's make good use of it.
I got some paperwork I can take care of.
Well, I guess I can write some fillers for tomorrow night's show.
I think I'll go listen to my album.
- Hey, Mary, can you type this up again?
- Oh, sure, Mr. Grant.

How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all -  -  Mary?
- Yeah, come on in, Rhoda.
- Hey, Mar, can you give me a lift to work this morning?
- My car pool didn't pick me up.
- How come?
They're sore at me.
It finally dawned on them I don't have a car.
- Yeah, I'd be glad to.
- Good.
Rhoda, do I look all right to you?
- Terrific.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, that's some color.
- Yeah?
Good.
All right, dress, you are no longer returnable.
You are mine, all mine!
I never knew anyone to buy a brand-new dress for a Wednesday morning.
Well, I just want to make an impression on somebody.
- Really?
That's great.
Tell me all about him.
- Yes.
He's got a terrific sense of humor and a great personality.
Hey, that's how people describe me.
He can't be too great.
What does he look like?
He also happens to be very good-looking.
- Slightly gray.
- Slightly gray?
Where?
His face?
His suit?
Around the temples.
- Has he got a name?
- His name is Paul Arnell.
Hey, well, you You've met his brother, Howard Arnell.
Remember?
- I dated him a couple of times.
- Oh, that Howard.
Yeah.
But don't worry.
Paul is nothing like Howard.
I don't think Paul even owns a tie that lights up in the dark.
How did you meet Paul?
I mean, did Howard introduce you to him?
No.
We're doing a series of interviews with Congressman Styron, and Paul writes his speeches, so we've met a couple of times.
He's coming by the office today, so ta-da!
Yeah.
Has he asked you out or anything?
He did once.
I couldn't make it.
I told him I was doing something.
So tell him you've stopped doing it.
Hello.
Who?
- Oh, hi, Howard.
- Howard Arnell?
Yeah, I did.
I bumped into Paul the other day.
Well, I don't remember giving him any message.
Oh, unless you mean, I told him to be sure and say hi to Howard.
And you're just calling to say hi right back.
Well, well.
Hi.
Listen, uh, Howard, I've gotta run.
I'm, uh I've got some guests here.
- Yes, a few people just dropped in.
-   Oh, I don't know.
I guess they'll be here a couple of hours, anyway.
You'll, uh You what?
You'll hold.
Oh, yes, of course I knew you were just kidding.
I knew that.
Listen, l-I really I have to go.
- All right.
I won't take any wooden nickels.
Uh-uh.
- Come on, Mary.
Yes, I'll be sure to say hi to Paul when I see him.
- Right.
Good talking to you too.
Bye-bye, Howard.
- Mary.
Quick, before he calls again.
Mary, have you got Congressman Styron's questions for Paul Arnell when he gets here?
- Right on your desk.
- Good.
You know, Murray, I've been meaning to ask you, - just hypothetically speaking, if, uh - Mm-hmm.
if a man has asked a woman out and she couldn't make it, how does she go about asking him or getting him to ask her out again?
Oh, well, it depends on who the particular man is and who the particular woman is.
Well, nobody nobody in particular.
Any two people.
Just hypo-you-know-thetically speaking.
Hey, is the hypothetical woman you?
I shouldn't even have brought it up.
It's just that there's something, you know, kind of interesting about him.
- Who?
- Paul Arnell.
Paul Arnell?
Hey, he's great.
Why don't you go out with him?
Well, l I don't know.
- This came off the wire, Mr. Grant.
- Thanks.
- Uh, Mary?
- Sir?
Skip it.
Uh,  skip what?
Sit down.
Mary, I know what you think of me.
Same as everyone else thinks of me all business, no time for sentiment, tough Lou Grant.
Oh, no.
No, Mr. Grant.
- I don't think that you're so - What?
Well, usually I do.
Tough Lou Grant.
But underneath it all, Mary, I think of you Well, I think of you like a daughter, which is saying a lot, because I have three daughters, and one of them I don't even think of as a daughter.
- You know, you're very sweet.
- What?
In a tough sort of way.
Right.
So when I heard certain things around the office, I made certain inquiries so that maybe I could help you out with a certain situation.
Well, I, uh, certainly want to thank you, Mr. Grant.
- But I don't know what you're talking about.
- Not what, who.
Paul Arnell.
- What?
- " Makes 13 thou a year, lives here in town.
A B.A. from Dartmouth.
Military: - four years in the air force reserves".
- Uh, no.
No.
Mr. Grant, l-I don't want to hear this.
- "Marital status" - Uh, go on.
"Never been married".
Thank you.
Murray, you just couldn't wait to go and tell Mr. Grant about Paul Arnell.
Oh, hey, it wasn't like that at all.
Look, the man asked me a direct question, and I had to answer him.
He said, "Who"?
and I said, "Paul Arnell".
Could you tell me why Mr. Grant would say, "Who"?
Because he said, "Guess what guy Mary's interested in".
Mary's interested in someone?
Who?
Uh-uh.
Don't tell me who it is.
Just what are the initials?
- Oh, Ted.
- Oh, come on, Mar.
Everyone here knows but me.
Murr, how about you?
Come on, what are the initials?
- All right, all right.
The initials are P.A. - "P.A." - As in Paul Arnell.
- Oh, as in Paul Arnell.
It wouldn't be Peter somebody, would it, Mar, huh?
Huh?
Okay, okay.
Everybody here is acting pretty cute, but let me tell you, if you're still acting pretty cute when he gets here, I mean it, I'm gonna quit!
Mary, don't worry.
We won't even be here.
- We'll leave, okay?
- Okay.
-  Oh, hi, Paul.
- Hi.
Arnell, good to see you.
Paul Arnell!
P.A. Paul Arnell.
- We gotta go now, Paul.
Come on, Ted.
- I guessed it, didn't I?
- We gotta go now, Paul.
Come on, Ted.
- I guessed it, didn't I?
Didn't I guess it?
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
- What's the matter with your eye?
- Uh Hi.
No, it's gonna be all right.
It's okay.
- Did you get something in it?
- Uh, just a fist.
- A what?
- Oh, nothing.
Nothing.
- Paul, let me see it.
-  Pretty bad, huh?
- Uh, no, it looks pretty good.
- Really?
It's amazing to me how much punishment the human face can take before it breaks.
Oh.
Do you got any coffee?
Yeah, sure.
But Paul, what happened?
Oh, I was sitting next to this guy at a lunch counter, and he's reading Styron's speech in the newspaper.
- And he's making loud, rude remarks, you know?
- Uh-huh.
So, I, uh Oh, cream and sugar.
Okay.
Did you tell him that you wrote it?
Oh, no, not right away.
He had a tattoo.
Uh, Paul, what has that got to do with it?
Well, Mary, look, there are two kinds of people in the world guys with tattoos and guys who are afraid of getting hit by guys with tattoos.
Well, did you finally tell him that, uh, you wrote the speech?
Well, did you finally tell him that, uh, you wrote the speech?
Huh?
Yeah.
So anyway, I say, "Hey, look, my friend.
I wrote that speech".
So he gets a little embarrassed, you know, and that's when he hit me.
Well, you didn't get into a real, you know, a fight, did you?
- Fight?
No, no, Mary, there was no fight.
- Good.
It was more like a"beating up".
At least you acted civilized.
I mean, you didn't hit him back.
Worse.
I did worse.
I, uh I kicked him.
I mean, all your life, since you were a kid, all you ever hear is, "Men don't kick, not under any circumstances".
- And girls don't bite or scratch.
- Except during wartime.
Then maybe an enemy soldier would kick.
- Yeah.
Or bite or scratch even.
- Yeah.
But not a wholesome American boy.
- Hey, Paul, that eye does look like it's beginning to swell up.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- Do you put hot or cold water on a swollen eye?
If you go sit down, I'll do it.
Ooh!
You know, I think I wrecked my toe.
- When you kicked him?
- Yeah.
I missed him, and I hit the counter.
And I think I got him.
I think he must've broken his fist on my face.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
That's good.
Other eye.
- He hit you there too?
- No, it just feels good.
- Close your eye.
- Say, listen, Mary, would you would you be suspicious if I showed up at your apartment every night and you had to fix up my eye?
No, not in the least.
Oh.
Would you, uh How about Friday night, say around 8:00?
Are you busy?
Uh, Friday night at Without a swollen eye.
No, I'm not busy.
I'd like that.
Great.
That's terrific.
- I'll be looking forward to it.
- Me too.
See you.
Paul!
The, uh, Styron interview.
We, uh, still haven't gone over the Styron material.
Styron, right.
Yeah.
After I made such a great exit.
Why is nothing ever perfect?
Hey, Mary, I don't see one person with graying temples.
- Give me a zip?
- Oh, sure.
Don't you feel a little peculiar about going out with Paul?
- Why?
- Because of Howard.
Rhoda, I told you, Howard and I were never what you'd call a "big thing".
- I thought he told you he loved you.
- Yeah, he did.
He tells everybody he loves them.
Rhoda, if you dialed the wrong number and got Howard, he'd tell you he loves you.
He would, huh?
That's worth a dime.
It's been a while.
It's a magnifying mirror.
Mary, why didn't you warn me?
I thought it was a relief map of the moon.
You know, when they sell a magnifying mirror, they should include a printed suicide note.
- Uh, Rhoda, I think that's probably Paul.
- Yeah, probably.
So if you wanna, uh  Okay, if you want me to stay around and help you break the ice, I'd be glad to.
- Hi, Paul.
- Hi.
Let me take your coat.
I'd like you to meet my friend, Rhoda Morgenstern.
This is Paul Arnell.
- Well, hello, Paul.
- Nice to see you.
Mary didn't tell me she was expecting company.
I guess I'll just be running along.
Say, Mary, you know that package that was delivered?
- Uh - You know the one I mean.
It has very nice wrapping.
Very nice wrapping.
- Good night, Rhoda.
- Much nicer than its brother.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I was I was gonna bring you something, but I couldn't decide what.
Wha What do you mean?
Like candy?
Or gum.
I don't know.
- Something kind of first date-like.
- Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Look, to tell you the truth, l-I hate first dates.
Oh, Paul, me too.
I hate them.
- It seems like every time l - Would you like to sit down?
There.
- The first-date craziness.
- Right.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
Uh, say, Mar, do you remember - when I was beaten up and I came to your office the other day?
- Yeah.
Well, why don't we call that our first date?
- Then we can call this our second date.
- Terrific.
I love that idea.
-  - Good.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm rushing into things, but, um, this just being our second date, I'd like to take you home and have you meet my folks.
- What?
- No, it's not what you think.
See, they're leaving for Europe tomorrow for two months, and I've just gotta stop by.
Oh.
Well, sure.
I'd like to see them again.
I met them once with Howard.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's really not where I would like to take you on our first time.
- Ah!
- Second time.
You know, if this was our first date, in a couple of hours I'd probably be standing right here wondering, uh, should I kiss her good night while I got her, or should I just wait?
Take a chance maybe she'll invite me in.
You know what I mean?
- All that stupid stuff.
- I know.
Like, should I let him know that I wouldn't mind if he kissed me good night, or then would he think that I was Well, you know.
Mary, just to get it out of the way I want you to know, Mary, that I still respect you.
- Well, Mother, look who's here.
- Hi!
- We just stopped by to see if this charming house was for sale.
- Hello.
- You remember Mary Richards.
- Aren't you a pleasant surprise.
Well, Mary, what a coincidence.
We were just talking about you the other day.
- Oh, really?
- Won't you sit down?
Before you get settled, I got something to show you in the workshop.
- Howard's invented a new one.
- You may not notice, Mary, but our Howard is considered an innovative genius in his field.
You know, I've never really been sure what his field was.
I know he has something to do with bow ties that light up.
That's it, the under-nine-dollars novelty business.
Look at this cigarette box.
Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health.
Cigarette smoking may be - That's Howard.
- Fine.
To think.
Oh, Mary, you're standing on hallowed ground.
Isn't this true, Mom?
Right on this exact spot on May 29, 1968, Howard Arnell invented reversible socks.
Plain on one side, argyle on the other.
Don't feel compelled to comment.
A simple gasp will do.
Dad, wait up!
- It's a lovely home.
- Oh, thank you.
- Who are all the kids?
- Oh, they're Howard.
- Where's Paul?
- Oh.
Here.
It's not very good of him, but it's quite flattering of the Santa Claus.
Would you like some coffee?
Uh, yes, thank you.
Black, please.
It was a lovely idea of Howard's to have Paul bring you by.
Oh, no, it wasn't Howard's idea.
It was Paul's.
Oh, really?
But it sounds so Howard.
So considerate.
When was the last time you talked with him?
Uh, with Howard?
Just a couple of days ago, as a matter of fact.
- How did he sound?
- Well, he sounded like Howard.
What a lovely thing to say.
Let me tell you, Mary, all we hear from our boy, is "Mary this" and "Mary that".
- Uh, really?
- His father said to me, "When are Howard and Mary going to tie the knot"?
But I said, "Well, that's up to Mary.
After all, she's Howard's girl".
Very funny, Paul.
I show him Howard's new musical razor that's already sold over 500 gross.
All he can say is, " Very cute, but does it play 'Melancholy Baby'"?
Come on, Dad.
So I made a joke.
I think it's great that they're selling.
He made a joke.
That's why he wouldn't go into business with me.
Because the whole thing is one big joke.
Ha-ha.
- Well, novelties are no joke to Howard.
- Brian, we have company.
I'm sure to a big Ivy Leaguer like Paul a joke of a business like novelties Well, how can it compare with writing out a lot of speeches for people?
Oh, now, Dad, wait a minute.
It's not what you call "just writing out a lot of speeches for people".
- Paulie, he's just talking.
- Yeah, Mom, I know.
But I've gotta say it.
It's not what you'd call " writing out a lot of speeches for people".
It's trying to get the thoughts of a very dedicated and concerned man down on paper.
Did you read Styron's last speech?
His last speech?
No, he didn't.
Well, you should've.
Look, all the New York papers said it was a turning point in Styron's career and that with his kind of outspokenness, he could be a contender for governor in a few years.
And after that, who knows?
He could go anyplace, even the White House.
Maybe even the White House, Dad!
So when I'm writing for Styron, that's what I'm writing about.
Well, as long as you're keeping busy.
Well, it's good to be home.
Listen, this is your bon voyage party, so let's wish you a bon voyage.
Are you really looking forward to your trip?
We're going to London, Dublin, Asia and Paris.
Tell me, is there something you'd like us to bring you back?
Oh, well, that's very sweet, but no, thank you.
How about some nice Irish lace?
Howard would love you in lace.
- Mom.
- Well, he would.
After all, Irish lace makes such a nice you-know-what veil.
Well, thank you, Paul.
I had a really great, you know, time.
Oh, sure, you had such a great time, you're home at 9:30.
If you would've had any more of a great time, you could've been home by 8:30.
Mary, I'll tell you, they're just weird on the subject of Howard.
All that talk about you and Howard.
I should've said something.
No.
No, I should've said something.
It's just that it's a little difficult to tell a woman you're not interested in her son when you're staring into practically a shrine of his baby pictures.
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thanks, Mary.
No.
I tell you, I'm going back to the house.
- Well Now?
- Yes.
Right now.
Those two people are leaving for Europe tomorrow for two months.
I don't want them spending another 60 days thinking you are Howard's girl.
- Do you wanna come with me?
- Well, I don't know.
I think I'd probably feel a little funny.
Well, okay, if you feel funny.
But I've gotta go back there.
He walks up the stairs to the door hoping she'll follow.
He looks back.
She gave him an encouraging smile.
And she made a decision.
She's going with him.
And a moment later, she's there by his side.
Taking his arm, she turned out the lights, and they walked wordlessly into the night.
Oh, uh, Mrs. Arnell, we didn't realize that you'd be - No, Mary, come in.
- We didn't want to disturb you folks.
Oh, you're not disturbing us.
Well, we were sort of hoping you'd pop back, weren't we, Brian?
What do you mean?
Tonight?
I don't know how to start here.
Yes, I do.
Listen, Mom, Mary is my date.
- She's not Howard's girl.
- Does Howard know this?
Mrs. Arnell, you know, I went out with Howard exactly three times.
He asked me out a fourth time, which was about 11 months ago, and I said no.
Are you trying to tell me that your plans for the marriage are off?
Yeah, I think I can safely say that the plans for the marriage are off.
Well, as long as you're here, you may as well sit down.
So, Mom, what are you, uh - Looking at slides, huh?
- I don't know.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, you were.
You were looking at slides.
Dad, where'd you get all these viewer things?
Howard got a deal on them, so he's trying to work them into something musical.
- Hey, there's a nice shot.
- That's Dublin.
You know, I thought that you two had never been to Europe, Mrs. Arnell.
Uh, Mr. Arnell, I thought you two had never been to Europe.
We haven't.
These are places we're gonna visit.
So we'll recognize them when we get there.
Come on, Mother, look at slides.
It's getting late.
Okay, here we go.
Viewers up, everybody.
Everybody click to number one.
- Everybody got number one?
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
- Good.
- Gee, this certainly is beautiful.
Where is it?
Looks like Disneyland.
No.
No, Dad.
It's the Kremlin.
Well, we're not going there.
Number two.
Everybody click to number two.
You can click all you want, but I'm not going.
- You're not what?
- I'm not going to Europe, Brian.
That's all, period.
What, are you crazy?
What do you mean you're not going?
She's going, she's going.
Click to number three, everybody.
Number three.
Click, click, click, Brian, but I'm not leaving my two sons alone in America with that Well, I'm just not leaving my two sons alone in America.
Oh, Mom.
- Mrs. Arnell.
- I don't want to discuss it.
No, Mrs. Arnell, really.
I mean I don't have any designs on your sons.
Howard and I never did have any kind of relationship.
Paul and I are just on our second no, first date.
So we don't even know how we feel about each other.
So go.
Wrong.
Speak for yourself.
I know how I feel about you.
I'm crazy about her.
-  - Four.
Everybody click to number four.
That's a nice clear shot, isn't it?
That's Paris.
Wait for me, Brian.
Let me catch up.
All right.
Now, this thing here, of course, is your Eiffel Tower.
Wouldn't Howard love to see this?
I miss him already.
Maybe you can take him with you.
Seven.
Everybody, let's, uh, click right on to seven.
- Everybody got number seven?
- Yeah.
You get the feeling we're always standing here?
- Uh, well, sort of, yes.
- Yeah.
Well, here we are.
Do I come in or say good night?
Do I talk a lot to cover my self-consciousness?
Why don't we discuss it inside?
Well, tomorrow morning, You think your mother's ever gonna recover?
Recover?
Wait till she sees her present.
- What'd you get her?
- Howard.
I bought him a ticket.

What do you say we go out and buy ourselves a nice lunch?
Gee, I'd love to, Murray, but I just don't think I can afford it.
Well, maybe I could lend it to you.
No, no.
I still owe you five dollars from last Friday.
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.
Don't you remember?
- We had lunch at Quo Vadis.
- Alfredo's.
- And I ordered lobster thermidor.
- Lobster Newburg.
- So you lent me some money, remember?
- No, I'd completely forgotten.
Are we having the old Friday lunch-a-rino, gang?
How about it, Mar?
It's just gonna have to be you and Murray.
I'm a little short this week.
If you need to borrow money, I'm sure Murray would be glad to lend it to you.
-  - Newsroom.
Mary Richards.
Bob Freelander here, general manager of WKS.
Yes, sir.
Just a moment.
I'll put Mr. Grant on.
- No, I wanna talk to you.
- To me?
I'm interviewing several young women for a producer's job.
- I'd like to talk to you about it.
- You're considering me for a-a producer's job?
Yes, on a new talk show for ladies.
We're calling it The Ladies' Talk Show.
- Certainly is catchy.
- How soon can you get in here so we can talk?
I don't see how I can during, you know, working hours.
Then we'll do it today on your lunch hour.
We can lunch and chat right here in my office.
Let's say 12:30?
Well, all right, 12:30 will be fine.
I'll see you then.
Wait a minute.
I'd like to order some lunch.
What would you like?
Oh, um, a hamburger and coffee.
If you're ordering lunch, get me a ham sandwich, a glass of milk and a side of French fries.
And a ham sandwich, a glass of milk and a side of fries.
I'll have a pastrami on rye and a vanilla shake.
And a pastrami on rye and a vanilla shake.
Is it good news or bad news?
Phyllis, since when do you greet bad news with champagne?
Champagne?
Mary!
I didn't know they even made it in Idaho.
So, what's the news?
So, the news is that I have been offered a new job to produce a women's talk show at another television station.
- Mary, produce?
- Producer!
-  That's terrific!
- It means a lot more money.
It means my own office and a private secretary.
And you'll meet new guys, and you'll be able to afford a whole new wardrobe.
Right.
And I don't wanna do it.
Oh, yeah.
Money, guys, glamour.
Who wants that?
If you don't want the job, then why the champagne?
Because I'm gonna have to take this job.
l-I can't afford not to.
So I'm trying to convince myself that I'm really happy about it.
So why don't we have some champagne and celebrate my new job?
- Why don't we?
- Because I don't want a new job.
I mean, I will be leaving a lot of people that I love.
And I feel like a traitor to Mr. Grant.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Your only loyalty should be to yourself.
But Phyl, Mr. Grant took a big chance on me.
When he hired me, I was completely inexperienced.
That's like saying that I owe Lars something for marrying me because I was completely inexperienced.
Mary, take the job.
- You owe it to yourself.
- I just don't know.
Mary, look, if you don't wanna leave, go in to Lou Grant and demand a raise.
Oh, Rhoda, I could get a raise.
What I need is a raise.
It's It's painfully simple.
There are two choices here.
-  Lou Grant meets your price.
Or  You quit.
- You're right.
It is.
It's painfully simple.
- Well, I guess we don't need this yet.
- Hey, Mary, next time you throw a party, let us know beforehand if you're gonna open the bottle.
You know, Murray, maybe I don't need a raise after all.
I'm going over my budget, and I figure that on my salary I can't possibly make it, but somehow this month I did.
It's fantastic.
It came out even, right down to the penny.
- Well, almost.
- Did I pay you back that five dollars I owe you?
I do need a raise, don't I?
Newsroom.
Mary Richards.
Oh, hello, Mr. Free  lander.
Uh, no, I haven't made that decision yet.
Twenty dollars a month for gasoline.
That's not bad.
Uh, yes, sir, I understand that you'd like an answer soon.
Hey, Murr, this girl throws away more money on food than I spend on booze.
It's just that it's not quite as easy to come to You know, there are other factors to consider here.
Twenty-five dollars a month for dry cleaning?
- That includes my laundry.
Uh - Oh.
Listen, I'll try to get back to you this afternoon.
Um Would ten minutes be all right?
- All right.
I'll talk to you then.
Good-bye.
- Never make it.
- I know.
Mr. Grant?
- Huh?
- Could I speak to you for a minute?
- Sure.
Come on in.
Mr. Grant, the reason that I have been going over my budget - is I have been offered a new job.
- You've been offered another job.
- It's over at WKS to produce a ladies' talk show - WKS.
- called the Ladies' Talk Show.
- Ladies' Talk Show.
- You knew?
- Well, the broadcasting industry in this town is like a big family.
Everybody knows what everybody else is doing.
For example, Bob Freelander undoubtedly knows that this morning I went to our general manager and told him I wanted to give you a raise.
Oh, Mr. Grant, that's just wonderful.
- Because I was just - It would've been, but he turned me down.
Now, before you get on the phone and try to tell Freelander that you'll take his job, let me give you a word of advice: don't.
Give me a good reason not to, please.
Mary, it's cold out there.
Everyone's jockeying for position, ready to cut each other's throat.
- Is that what you want?
- You guessed it, Mr. Grant.
I wanna go out there and scratch and claw for power.
I'll stop at nothing in my ruthless fight for the top.
Mary, it's dog eat dog in this business.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I thought you said the broadcasting business was like a big family.
I didn't say it was a nice family.
Mr. Grant, we both know what has to be done here, and it would make it a whole lot easier for me if you would be the one to say it.
Mary you are going to have to quit me.
Couldn't you just have said, " quit the station" or just a plain " quit"?
Well, I guess I said that because I hired you, not the station, me.
But just because I went out on a limb for you, I certainly wouldn't want any sense of loyalty to me to interfere with a better deal for you.
I'm sure glad you're not putting this on any kind of personal basis.
The reason I am is 'cause I don't want you to go.
I'll miss you.
I'll miss you too.
When does Freelander want you to start?
He said as soon as you can find a replacement for me.
Don't worry about that.
Go.
Well, then, I guess I'll clean out my desk on Friday.
Okay.
Hey.
I wanna give you a going-away party.
Who usually arranges for those things?
I do.
-  - It's Rhoda.
- Come on in.
-  That you, Rhoda?
- Yes, Phyllis, yes.
I am going into Mary's apartment.
Yes.
She doesn't miss a thing that goes on in this entire building.
Hey, Mary, I just washed my hair.
Can I borrow your dryer?
- I'm sorry, Rhoda.
It's broken again.
- Oh.
Listen, soon the money will start pouring in from your new job, and we'll be able to afford a new one.
- Can I borrow your stove?
- Yeah, sure.
It beats trying to dry your hair over a hot plate.
Hey, Mary, were you in bed?
I'm sorry.
Oh, no.
Listen, I tried to go to sleep, but I just couldn't.
I guess it's because of the new job.
Or possibly because it's only 8:30.
Yeah?
And I was sitting around here thinking about leaving the newsroom tomorrow.
I got myself so depressed I decided I'd just go to bed.
Yeah.
You know what hot milk tastes like?
Hot milk.
Sure.
I'm an expert on the stuff.
Did you know that the first man to drink hot milk invented the word "yech"?
Hey, come on, kid.
Let's just talk, huh?
Yeah.
Good.
Anything.
I just don't want to think about that new job.
What do you want to talk about?
They showed me my new office today.
Outside it there was this bunch of girls all laughing and giggling, having fun.
There I was, inside my private cubicle practicing sitting behind this big desk, looking like an executive.
I felt like Rosalind Russell.
Yeah, Mary, it's gonna be tough trying to find you a tweed suit with padded shoulders.
Hey, wait.
No, it isn't.
I just remembered.
I've got one.
- Oh.
- Hi.
Why didn't you tell me you were having a pajama party?
- Phyllis, I'm not wearing pajamas.
- Oh.
- With you, it's always so hard to tell, Rhoda.
- Good one.
- So, what did I miss?
- Nothing much.
I was just telling Rhoda how hard it's gonna be to leave my old job tomorrow.
Oh, Mary, dear, funny Mary.
There are some lessons that I've learned in my life that I would like to share with you right now.
Mary, you know that trouble you've been having tonight about sleeping?
This ought to do it.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
-  - Life as I see it is a long trail of leavings.
What I mean is, you leave school, you leave home, you leave jobs Phyllis, leave me alone.
I know what you're getting at, but it's not gonna help me.
Yes, it will, Mary.
If you just let me explain it to you the way I explained it to Bess.
But Phyllis, I'm not 12 years old.
Last year, she had this marvelous opportunity to go to camp, but she was miserable about having to leave, just as you are.
I mean, the situations are so analogous, it's well, it's astounding.
But I explained to her the fun she'd have doing new things making buttons out of walnuts, short-sheeting the counselor's bunk.
Phyl Mary, not only that, but making new little friends.
An adventure.
It'll be the same with you, Mary an adventure.
You'll see.
Everything will be just fine.
But I don't want to go to camp.
- Hi, guys.
- What are you doing out of bed at this hour?
Murray asked me to come in early.
Yeah, I wrote a farewell speech to Mary to close the show with tonight.
I figure if Ted studies it all day, maybe he can do it on the air tonight without a goof.
Mary's still not here.
I'm gonna have to make these party arrangements myself.
Murray, you're gonna have to help me make some phone calls.
- Anything at all I can do?
- I've been asking myself that same question about you for years now.
- Who do you want me to call?
- Let's see.
I want this to be a party to remember.
Get a large punch bowl and get me a distillery and two lemons.
I want this to be big.
By the way, Ted, you haven't kicked in yet.
- How much is this going to cost?
- Up there.
Maybe into two figures.
- Two figures?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know why every time we turn around, we have to throw our hard-earned money away on some frivolous party.
- What about flowers?
- Flowers too.
Let's see.
"Distillery, punch bowl, lemons".
- What time would you like the Minneapolis Symphony to arrive?
- Aah, you.
Here's five dollars, Murr.
Take what you need out of that and give me the change later.
This desk will never be the same.
Yeah, I know.
Mary's old desk.
Maybe we should retire it.
You know, like they do football players' jerseys.
Where is she, anyway?
Isn't she even gonna show up on her last day?
The girls from Sales took her out to a farewell champagne breakfast.
And at noon, the guys from Promotion are buying her a farewell drink and lunch - The guys gotta be snockered before the party.
- Yeah.
Newsroom.
No, Miss Richards isn't here.
Who's calling?
Oh, hi, Freelander.
Lou Grant.
Yeah, I'll have her call you, maybe.
Hey, Freelander, you got yourself a good girl.
You'd think Mary would be back from lunch by dinnertime.
- I'm beginning to get worried.
- It's all right.
The whole production department hasn't come back from lunch, either.
If she doesn't hurry, she's gonna miss Ted doing the farewell speech I wrote.
Uh-uh.
Don't do that.
You'll dent the dip.
- Listen, my stomach is growling.
- Well, take a drink.
Why do you think my stomach's growling?
I had a drink.
I gotta have some food.
This punch Lou made is gonna eat right through my stomach.
Well, you can't eat.
I want everything to look perfect for Mary when she gets here.
- Lou?
- Hmm?
What is that shriveled-up little thing doing in the punch?
Five minutes ago that was a fresh gardenia.
Hey, here it is.
Mary's gonna miss it.
Hey, everybody, here's the farewell speech.
Gather around.
Tonight for my sign-off, in place of my usual droll anecdote, I'd like to get serious for a moment.
The associate producer of our 6:00 news is leaving our friendly fold for greener pastures.
It is with mixed joy and sadness that we view her exodus.
So all of us here at WJM wish a bon voyage through the ocean of life and the best of luck to our own Mary "Rickards".
Richards!
Her name is Richards!
- It's my fault.
It's all my fault.
- Why your fault?
I wrote the whole speech out phonetically, except for Mary's name.
- How'd it sound, boys?
- "Rickards"!
You said "Rickards"!
I don't get your point, Murr.
- Her name is Richards.
- Now I get your point.
Hi, guys.
-  - Hi, Mar.
- Hi, Murray.
Hi, Ted.
- Hi, Mary.
Hello, Mr. Lou.
Did you have a nice lunch?
Oh, you know.
All I know is that the service must have been rotten.
You've been gone for over six hours.
Is there anything new around here that I should know about?
Not much.
Your new boss called.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Try to keep it down.
Everybody's looking.
I know.
Everybody kept buying me drinks, and I kept letting them, because I couldn't face coming back here and having to say good-bye to all of you.
I will be just fine.
Just give me a moment alone.
Don't worry.
I will not embarrass you you good old boss.
It's gonna be some party, baby.
I'm nothing, Gordy.
All I've got are looks and a voice.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I'm telling you, Gordy, I'm just a no-talent.
Somebody put truth serum in the punch.
Lou, Murray, you might as well hear this too.
I do a good job of hiding it, but I'm a lousy newsman.
That's not true, Ted.
You don't do a good job of hiding it.
Get yourself together.
You're being too hard on yourself.
- No, he's not.
-   Oh, just a - wonderful bunch of wonderful guys.
- Mm-hmm.
-  - She really picks up a party, doesn't she?
I should've stayed with what I started out to be, the only thing I ever really wanted to be a male fashion model.
A male model?
Well, if he wants to be a model, I guess that's the best kind to be.
I used to look at glossy pictures of those guys in the ads standing there like this.
How do I look?
Sober?
- Sober.
- I think it's happened.
- What's happened?
- I've built up an immunity to booze.
- Lou?
Gordy?
- Hmm?
- Yeah?
- Now, I am in the presence of real men, and I know I can trust you.
- Yeah.
Uh-huh.
- I have been happily married to the same woman for ten years.
- You know that.
- Yeah.
- But every once in a while - Hold it, Murray.
I've been here a few times in bars, at various parties.
People sometimes say things at times like this that they later wished they hadn't.
- Yeah.
- So I'd like to stop you right now - from mentioning any names.
- Marie McGuire.
You tried.
- I didn't hear it.
- Marie McGuire.
She was a pom-pom girl in college.
Oh, boy, was she something.
Blond hair, blue eyes.
- Blond hair, blue eyes.
-  Marie That's your wife.
- Yeah, I know.
Isn't it terrific?
-  This is gonna be one of those big parties.
Where are you going?
Well, it's, uh, getting late, and l I just thought I really couldn't face any plain old good-byes, so I was planning to call everybody individually, you know, next week and I figured if I stayed any longer, somebody would probably start singing - # For she's a jolly good fellow # - Yeah.
Oh.
# For she's a jolly good fellow # For she's a jolly good fellow - I can't sing either.
- # Which nobody can deny ## - Speech, Mary.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Let's hear something.
Say a few words.
- Speech!
Speech!
l-I don't know what to say to tell you how I feel, except to say that I'll never forget any of you.
Of course you won't.
We'll be seeing each other all the time.
Well, that's right.
We will.
- We'll be seeing each other all the time.
- We'll have lunch together.
- Lunch together.
We will.
- Every week.
Every week we will have lunch together.
I don't know who I'm trying to kid.
I've been to enough of these things to know people say they'll get together, but they never do.
The minute I walk out that door into your dog-eat-dog world, that's the last time I'll probably see any of you.
Well, except for Ted on the news.
Or in a fashion magazine.
So, anyway, I just want to say thank you and good-bye.
So, uh, come on, everybody.
This is a party.
Everybody's supposed to be having a very good time.
I know I am.
Mary, come into my office.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sit down.
Mr. Grant, I'm awfully sorry.
You gave me this beautiful party, and I put a damper on it.
You didn't put a damper on it.
You dropped a bomb on it.
But I don't care about that.
I'm gonna meet Freelander's offer.
Come on, Mr. Grant.
The general manager already turned you down once.
Yeah, but I didn't threaten to quit yet.
You'd quit for me?
No.
But the general manager doesn't know that.
So let's call Mr. Freelander and tell him to find somebody else for that job.
You mean right now?
Of course now.
Hello, uh, Mr. Freelander?
This is Mary Richards.
Um Could you hold on just a minute?
- Mr. Grant, it's so loud I can't think.
- Yeah.
Hey, hold it down out there!
Mary's on an important call.
Mr. Freelander, uh, there's been an interesting little development here.
Uh, listen, I know I haven't actually started to work for you yet, but, uh, I quit.
- I think she's going to stay.
- Well, Mr. Grant has met your offer, so I've decided to stay right here.
Oh, that was just some friends of mine.
Yes, sir, I do realize what I'm doing.
Yes, Mr. Freelander, I have given the matter a great deal of serious thought.
Thank you.
- Hiya, Ted.
- Oh, hi, Murr.
Oh, Mar, I just want to personally tell you how pleased I am that you've decided to stay.
Oh, thank you, Ted.
- It was a lovely party, wasn't it?
- The best.
We all chipped in, you know.
- Oh, did you?
- Yes.
And I was thinking that since it was a going-away party for you and you actually did not go away I mean, you were there enjoying the party like everyone else.
- Ted, are you suggesting that I, uh, chip in?
- Well - How much?
- Five.
Five?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all  On the lighter side of the news, Mr. and Mrs. Ira Kamansky of 62 Glendale were rudely awakened when a two-ton truck veered off the highway into their bedroom, stopping only inches away from the foot of their bed.
Both are being treated for shock.
That's the lighter side of the news?
Let me know when they get to the story on the apartment house fire.
I want to see what kind of film the new cameraman came up with.
I'm glad you finally gave Allen an assignment.
Lou, you sent the kid on a big story like that?
You gotta start somewhere.
At around 4:00 this afternoon, fire broke out on the top floor of an apartment house on Third Street.
It took two hours to get the fire under control, as you can see in this exclusive film report.
Mr. Grant, here's that film you wanted to see.
-  - Two families were trapped on the roof.
Shouldn't Allen have taken pictures of the people on the roof?
Or at least the fire.
What is that?
Oh, it's a brick.
It's a close-up of a brick.
And it's got ants crawling all over it.
The smoke became so thick in the halls that the frantic tenants were urged to jump into the safety nets below.
- What's that?
- It's a brick.
- With ants crawling all over it.
- I can see they're ants.
I want to know why we're showing them instead of the fire.
Mr. Grant, maybe Allen's camera slipped.
Murray, why did you let this film go on?
Did you think this was a National Geographic special?
Don't blame me.
The kid brought the film in as we were going on the air.
It just didn't occur to me to check to see if there were any ants on it.
Ah.
Mary, where is Allen?
He's in the control booth, I think.
Tell him I'd like to see him when he gets a chance.
Uh, Allen, Mr. Grant would like to see you when you get a chance.
Tell him to be sure he gets a chance within the next 20 seconds.
Better make it right away.
And that's the news till now.
This is Ted Baxter saying God bless and toodle-oo.
Did he like it?
Uh, well, you know, it's sort of hard to tell whether Mr. Grant likes something or not, Allen.
- But I think he can probably tell you better than I can.
- Thank you.
Come in.
- What were you sent out to cover?
- The fire.
That's right.
Now, I'm telling myself that this is your first job, so maybe I'm expecting too much of you to know a fire when you see one.
A fire is where there's a lot of smoke.
A fire is what those big red trucks are usually parked in front of.
A fire is red and hot, and a fire is news.
I know what a fire is.
Okay.
Okay.
I know what happened.
You put the wrong lens on your camera.
You thought you were shooting the whole building, but you were getting a close-up of the ants.
- It was an accident What?
- It wasn't an accident.
- I was making a comment by showing the ants.
- You did that on purpose?
I was showing how just a few feet away from the fire, life goes on.
Why not show that just a few feet away from the ants, there's a fire going on?
- Are you gonna let me go?
- No, I'm not gonna let you go!
Like it or not, I'm gonna have to make a news cameraman out of an insect freak.
For one thing, I'm short a cameraman.
For another thing well, you know.
Okay, if that's what you want, I'll give you film like the rest of the news shows.
I'd like that.
We've never had film like the rest of the news shows.
And another thing: You're on call around the clock.
I want you to keep us posted where you are every minute.
I'm gonna work your tail off!
I hope you've found some inspiration from our little chat.
Yes, sir.
- Hi.
- Hey, Allen, how's it going?
I got really, royally chewed out.
I guess you heard.
Oh, did you?
No, we You can't ever hear what goes on in Mr. Grant's office.
- There's so much noise -  Hey, Mary, has my wife called?
Uh, no, not yet, Mr. Gra-Grant.
So, listen, you got chewed out.
We've all been through the same thing.
- Right, Ted?
So don't worry about it.
- Right.
How'd you like to come home and have dinner with my wife and me tonight?
- Oh, no, thanks.
Thanks anyway, but - Okay.
Good night.
You shouldn't be alone, kid.
What you need is some company.
Now, I've got a manicure.
You want to come and watch?
Oh, maybe some other time.
Thanks anyway, Mr. Baxter.
- Good night, Mar.
- Good night, Ted.
Well, Allen, I was gonna invite you over to my place for dinner - Great.
Is 7:30 all right?
- Uh, yeah.
Hi.
I thought I heard you.
- Oh, I didn't realize I was setting the table so noisily.
-  Mary, have you seen Bess?
She's late coming home from her Girl Scout meeting.
- No, I haven't.
- Not that I have to know where she is every minute.
But she is 20 minutes late.
Are you having Rhoda for dinner again?
- No.
- Oh, I see.
- But you have a place setting for two.
- Yeah, that's right.
You see, sometimes I like to switch places in mid-meal.
You don't want to tell me.
That's quite all right.
You're entitled to your privacy.
I don't care who you're having for dinner.
Since I don't care, why don't you tell me?
It's just a kid who's new at the office, and he had a run-in with Mr. Grant today, so I thought I'd bring him home for dinner and try to cheer him up.
- Oh!
- Hi.
I'm defrosting, and I need some ice cubes.
- Yeah, sure, help yourself.
- Have you seen Bess, Rhoda?
- Uh-uh.
- She's late getting home from her Girl Scout meeting.
Hey, maybe she's trying for her "staying out all night and not telling Mommy" merit badge.
Not that I'm concerned, mind you.
I believe in giving a child her independence.
Hi, Allen.
Come on in.
- Allen, I'd like you to meet my friend, Rhoda Morgenstern.
- Hi.
- This is Allen - Hi.
Stevens.
- Stevens.
Ma'am.
- Allen Stevens.
And this is Phyllis Lindstrom.
- Will you excuse me just a minute?
- Call me Phyl.
Everyone does.
- I don't.
- A lot of my young friends call me Phyl.
Okay, Phyl.
Some of her really young friends call her Ph'.
Hello.
Oh, hi, dear.
Yeah.
Okay, sure, I'll tell her.
Bye-bye.
Uh, that was Bess, and she's kind of worried about you.
- Where is she?
- She's still at the Girl Scout meeting.
- You were supposed to pick her up.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- Nice meeting you, Allen.
- See you later, Ph'.
- Would you like a drink?
- Can we see your I.D.?
I don't drink, but I would like a glass of water.
Is that the kitchen?
I'll go get it myself.
Okay.
The glasses are on the counter.
Isn't he cute?
Mary, what are you doing?
Managing Little League?
No, he's just he's just a sweet kid, and he kind of had a rough day at the office.
Uh-huh.
How old is he?
Uh, 22, 23, I think.
I don't know.
That's okay.
Nothing wrong with going out with someone 23.
I've done it myself.
I was 15.
-  I'm, uh, just getting some ice.
-  I'll help you.
That's okay.
I think I can get an ice tray out by myself.
No, really.
I insist.
Where were you when I had to lug my old stove down to the basement?
Hey, kid, keep those hands on that ice tray, huh?
I'm sorry.
My hand slipped.
Next time this happens, I'll press charges.
- What, uh - You know that shy kid in there?
He's not really all that shy.
You Hey, Mary, it was an accident.
I mean, I hope you don't think I'd fool around with one of your friends.
- One of anybody's friends.
- Well, l No, of course not, Allen.
No, it's just Rhoda's just overly suspicious.
She's from New York.
- Because if you did, well, l - No!
Hey, no.
Come on, sit down.
Have some cheese and crackers.
Funny thing is, she's not even my type.
Well, no, of course she's not.
She's a little older than you, like I am.
Yeah, but I wouldn't mind fooling around with you.
Uh, well, can I take your coat and your shoes?
- Oh, I just felt at home.
- Well, good.
Nice couch.
Does it fold out?
I mean, for you to sleep on.
You know, Allen, I, uh, think that somebody may have gotten the wrong idea here.
- You want me to go home.
Is that it?
- No, no.
When I want you to go home, I'll say, "Allen, go home".
I just think that there may have been Don't worry.
Nobody has to find out.
Allen, go home.
- But then you'd be all alone.
- Yeah, that's right.
You don't want to spend another of those lonely nights, do you?
Tsk.
Oh.
- What are you smiling at me like that for?
- Because you're cute.
You really think that because I'm 30 and single, that I'm desperate, right?
No, I meant that lfind you very attractive.
What does age have to do with anything?
Well, Allen, I'm really very flattered, but age has everything to do with it.
I mean, look, if I were 19 or 20, you'd be 11 or 12.
Anyway, you see what I mean?
So come on, let's have dinner.
- You just got me up here for nothing?
- No, no.
I got you up here for dinner.
Is that nothing?
It sure is.
Good night, Mary.
Allen, if you're trying to make us believe that Mary would invite you up to her apartment and then try to come on with you, forget it.
That's not our Mary.
And then what happened?
- Maybe I've said too much already.
- You're right.
I think I'll walk you to the studio, Allen.
And then what happened?
- Good morning, all.
-  Oh, hiya, Mary.
- How'd it go last night?
- How did what go?
Oh, your dinner with Allen.
Oh, fine.
How did you know that I had dinner with Allen?
I didn't invite him until after you left.
Oh.
Uh, well, he mentioned something.
Oh?
What did he mention?
Well, nothing, Mary, nothing.
Well, you know.
- No, I don't know.
- Well, I didn't believe him anyway.
Mary said that?
And then what did she do?
Oh, hi, Mar.
- Uh, Allen, could I see you for a minute?
- Sure, Mary.
Allen, I would like you to tell Murray, in front of me, exactly what happened last night.
I'm sorry.
You're right, Mary.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
It was just dumb bragging.
I'm sorry.
Brag Allen, you Oh, Murray, you he l No, nothing!
It was Oh, Ted!
Right after the coverage of the Winter Carnival Parade, we're gonna switch to a remote of Arthur Almoran covering the airport arrival of the, uh Anything you say, Mar.
Ted, you have to get all this down in 15 minutes.
- Have you heard anything I've been saying?
- Not a word.
Mary, I want to talk to you a minute.
Yeah, I'd like to talk to you too, Mr. Grant.
Mr. Grant, I would like to talk to you about Allen.
- Yeah, I know what you're gonna say.
- You do?
Yeah, you're gonna say I was too rough on him yesterday.
- Well, no, not exactly.
- Yes, you were, and you're right.
- Mary, I'm not the most patient man in the world.
- No, that's not true.
- I said I'm not the most patient man in the world!
- Well, that's true.
But Allen isn't exactly the easiest person to be patient with.
Mr. Grant, I don't know how else to tell you this other than to just come right out and say that Allen has been going around the station telling people Yeah, he's my nephew.
It's true.
He's my sister's kid.
And, Mary, that's why I gotta ask you a favor.
Asking favors isn't something I usually do.
I'm not good at it.
Boy, I'll say I'm not good at it.
I forgot my manners.
- Want a blast?
- Uh, no.
What that kid needs is a little understanding and compassion and all the rest of that bull.
You You can handle that, and I can't.
- Okay?
- Okay, what?
- Will you do me that favor?
- What favor?
Boy, I told you I wasn't any good at this.
I don't know how to ask for favors.
Forget the favor.
- Okay.
- I'll make it an order.
I want you to be understanding and sympathetic and compassionate to that kid.
- You got it?
- Oh, Mr. Grant, if it were anybody other than Allen If it were anybody other than Allen, I'd fire him.
You see, she's, uh, she's my only sister.
And I, uh I owe her something.
Oh, all right, Mr. Grant.
I'll do my best.
The reason I owe her something is, two years ago I fired her husband.
I wonder what for.
Now let me tell you the worst part.
Mr. Grant told Allen that I volunteered for the job.
So you can imagine what Allen thought.
- Well, tell him you didn't volunteer.
- I told him.
He didn't believe me.
He asked me what time I wanted him to come over tonight.
You should've told him you don't want him to come over.
I told him, and he said, "How about 8:30"?
- You should have told him you wouldn't be home.
- I told him, and I'm not.
- I am not going to be home.
I'm going to a movie.
Wanna go?
- Yeah, I would.
He'll only be back tomorrow.
What are you planning to do, go to a movie every night?
Of course not.
One night I'll go to a play and the next night to a concert.
I always did want to learn how to play pool.
What do you expect me to do?
It's so elementary, I shouldn't even have to say it.
But he only comes on when it's absolutely safe, with women who wouldn't ever be attracted to him.
Only you, Mary.
And me.
You?
When did he ever come on with you?
When we first met.
I picked up the vibrations when he came on with "Hi, Phyl," not "How do you do, Mrs. Lindstrom"?
- He said, "Ma'am".
- Believe me, Mary, if that boy ever thought someone was going to take him seriously, he would run for the hills.
I think I see what you mean.
In other words, if I pretended to be really interested in him, it would scare him off, huh?
- Exactly.
- Not in a million years.
That is the dumbest idea.
- It's dumb.
- All right, Mary.
All right.
Let people give you a lot of modern ideas on how to handle this.
As for me, give me good, old-fashioned common Freudian psychology anytime.
There she is, folks.
The sweetheart of Sigmund Freud.
- You are witty, Rhoda.
You really are.
- Thanks.
How much fun it must be for the other girls on your bowling team.
- Did you find a movie for us to see?
- Let's go to the Crestwood.
- Okay.
- If we're going to the show, I'll go upstairs and change.
- Wait.
I want to go with you.
- I'll wash the coffee cups.
Oh, would you, Phyl?
Great.
I don't want to chance being here, in case Allen arrives.
Mary, you wouldn't think my idea was bad if you read my copy of Post-Adolescent Social Trauma.
Well, fine, I will.
Lend it to me sometime.
- I lent it to you six weeks ago.
- You did?
Yeah, in that batch of books I brought up for you to read.
She figures if you study hard enough, anybody can become a loony.
I'll find it for you.
Really, it'll help.
Well, Phyl, I appreciate your wanting to help me out with this problem, but I honestly don't think it'll help.
Yes, it will.
Wait till I find it.
"Marriage as a Competition, The Liberated Female, The Creative Neurotic.
" None of these is it.
It must be here somewhere.
Let's get out of here, Mar.
If she finds out you're still saving your Nancy Drew books, you'll never hear the end of it.
- Hi.
Is Mary here?
- Oh, hi.
- She went out.
- Oh.
- Allen?
- Yes?
- Why don't you come in and wait for her?
- Okay.
I don't see how she can say it's a dumb idea.
It's right here.
- What is?
- Nothing.
Is she gonna be right back?
No.
That makes you nervous, doesn't it?
No.
Why should it?
Well, because you're alone with an attractive, mature woman.
- Now, doesn't that make you nervous?
- Uh-uh.
Oh.
Well, of course you're not nervous, because you feel safe, because you know that a person like me couldn't possibly be interested in you.
If you're not, why'd you call me back in here?
That's right, Allen.
You're right.
l-I am interested in you.
lfind you terrifically attractive.
Now, how does that make you feel?
Nervous?
That's right.
I understand why you have to leave now, and it's perfectly all right.
I'm glad I could clear this up for you.
Good-bye, Allen.
I do understand.
What I don't understand is why you're on this side of the door.
I don't think it's too tough to figure.
You just finished saying that You take one more step, I'm calling the police.
- Hey, wait a minute.
You just said that - There it is!
You took a step.
I'm calling the police.
See, I'm picking up the phone.
I have it in my hand.
See, I'm dialing the police station right now.
It's ringing in the police station.
The desk sergeant is picking the phone up right now.
Hello, Mary.
Guess who's here.
Allen.
Why don't you come right down?
And hurry.
- Hey, what's happening here?
- I'll tell you what's happening.
It's all right here.
Read this.
Chapter seven.
- Nancy Drew?
- That's Mary's book.
She saves things.
- Phyl!
- There he is, Mary.
He's all yours.
See if Nancy Drew can get you out of this one.
Hey, what is it with these friends of yours?
What is it with you, Allen?
Why don't you find a girl your own age?
You don't know?
What's the use?
- Pardon?
- I said, what's the use?
I don't have a quick comeback to that question.
I'm a phony.
I'm not a man.
I knew it since I was 12.
Allen, who knows they're a man when they're 12?
There's something wrong with me.
You bet there is!
You don't understand.
You see, I've never I mean, when the other kids were - I wasn't.
- Oh.
Well, I'm awfully sorry, Allen, but I don't see how You don't know what it's like to feel like you're the only virgin in the whole college.
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
I've been waiting for someone.
Someone kind and gentle and compassionate to help me find myself.
Well, Allen, couldn't you find a nice girl your own age to help you look?
I, uh I didn't know that all of this was behind all that craziness.
-  - Send away whoever it is.
I need to talk to you tonight.
Allen, I really do have to go answer the door.
- Who is it?
- Lou Grant!
- Where is he?
- Who, me?
You.
Guess what.
A brewery blew up tonight.
I know because I saw film of it on one of the other stations.
Since you weren't there, we don't have a single foot of film on it not even the lousy ants crawling around in the beer suds.
Mr. Grant, how did you know that he was here?
He left a message with his answering service saying where he'd be and that he didn't want to be disturbed.
I don't know how to break this to you, but I may end up disturbing you.
Uh, Mr. Grant, could I talk to you for just a moment, please?
Mr. Grant, Allen has problems.
He really does.
What's he been handing you?
What have you been handing her?
Mr. Grant, please, they're very personal problems, and they well, he has problems about women.
You do, huh?
Hey, Uncle Lou, I was just kidding around.
You were just kidding around?
Look, you, I want you to remember something and remember it forever.
I think of this girl here like she was my own daughter.
That means she's your cousin.
Do you get my meaning?
- Okay, I'm fired.
- Ooh, no, no, no.
As of now, you're third apprentice in the developing lab.
I can always quit.
- Who says so?
- Oh, well.
Now, look, there's only one woman down there in the lab.
She's a negative cutter named Jocelyn.
Tell him whatJocelyn's nickname is, Mary.
Well, it's not really a nickname.
It's just what some of the people Bomber.
Tell him what Bomber did at the last Christmas party, Mary.
Oh, you mean when she beat you, uh, arm wrestling.
That's the new woman in your life: Bomber.
Good night, Uncle Lou.
Cousin Mary.
-  - Hey, I want to apologize.
I mean, he's my family Uh, Mr. Grant, no, please.
There's no need.
I understand.
Every family has someone like that.
No, you don't understand.
In my family, he's the cream of the crop.
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night, Mr. Grant.
- Hi, Mar.
- Hi, Ted.
Good thing Lou put that kid in his place.
He's a troublemaker, you know?
He was even beginning to spread rumors around, about everyone.
- Even you.
- Oh, really?
Not that any one of us believed a word of it for a minute.
Well, that's certainly good to know.
You know, Mar, you've worked here quite a while now, but I don't feel we've ever really gotten to know each other.
Maybe sometime we could have dinner.
Oh, Ted, of course not!
Oh, yes.
Well, see you around.
And God bless.
And toodle-oo.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all - Hi, Mar.
- Good morning, Murray.
- You want to go ice skating at lunchtime?
- Well, I brought my lunch.
- Aw, come on.
- Well, no, Murray.
I tell you, when I skate, I just like to You know?
And you always want to Oh!
It's all right.
Have a nice, happy, little day.
You too.
##  Yes?
Something wrong?
Well, it's just that I've never seen you looking so refreshed.
Well, that's because I am refreshed.
- I got completely polluted last night.
- Oh.
Nothing like a good hangover to pick you up.
I wasn't hung over.
You gotta be over to be hung over.
I'm still half snockered.
That was some evening.
Me and John Corcoran, we were really flying.
John Corcoran, the one on the network news?
Oh, I see him from Vietnam in his combat jacket, ducking under the bullets.
- That's the one.
He used to work here.
- No kidding?
Hey, is he as great looking as he looks?
- I mean, on television.
- He's beautiful.
- That's coffee.
- Uh Like last night, about 2:00 a.m. We're in this place, see, and John orders sake.
- Japanese wine, right?
- Yeah.
Now, understand.
We're not in some quaint, littleJapanese restaurant.
We're in the Lucky 7-11 Bar and Grill a saloon.
Now, the bartender at the Lucky 7-11 doesn't get this request very often.
ButJohn just stands there, looking him straight in the eye.
And the bartender got him the sake.
No.
He threw us both out.
Uh, Mr. Grant?
I seem to have missed the point of the story.
The point is  I haven't been thrown out of a saloon in years.
And John managed it!
That's what I call a newsman.
Well, if that's what you call a newsman, what do youcall this?
- Hi, guys.
- What are you doing in so early?
I'm in because I'm upset about being wakened at 2:00 a.m. by an obscene phone call.
I've never had anyone say things like that to me.
- What are you telling me about it for?
- Because it was you!
Yeah.
Hey, I'm sorry about that, Ted.
It's just that whenever I'm with a really first-class newsman, I get furious thinking about you.
I'm glad he apologized!
I think that it cleared the air.
Newsroom.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
That was the receptionist.
She sounded like she was doing deep-breathing exercises.
John must be on his way up.
Now, look, everybody.
I know John, and even though he is kind of a famous guy and won a lot of awards, don't make a big deal over him, okay?
It would only embarrass him.
##  You still can't say hello like other people, can you, Murray?
You see?
What did I tell ya?
He's embarrassed.
- How are you?
- What are you doing up this early?
Don't you remember, Lou?
Last night, sitting on the curb in front of the Lucky 7?
You said I could use my old desk if I needed it.
- But it's occupied.
- Oh, was this your Well, all the desks are occupied.
I mean, l-I never use mine.
- I, uh I'm Mary Richards.
- John Corcoran.
You're gonna be around later, I'll buy you a sandwich.
- Fine, fine.
- Maybe we can get thrown out of a luncheonette.
No, you can't, Mr. Grant.
You're having lunch with the sanitation commissioner.
Oh, yeah.
Talk about garbage over lunch.
Sorry, John.
Look, as long as I'm chasing you out of your desk, can I take you to lunch?
- Uh, yes.
- Good.
Well, I guess you can take care of yourself.
After all, it's just a lunch.
Come on, John.
Come on.
- Lunch.
- Lunch.
Murray?
This is very good fettuccine.
Sure you don't want to try it?
No, thank you.
I've got this little meat patty here.
- John?
- What?
I lied.
I want to try your fettuccine.
- Hmm?
- Mmm!
- More?
- Oh, no.
I've seen you on television, haven't I?
- You're, uh Don't tell me - John Corcoran.
No, uh Yes!
Yes, you are.
Oh, you know, I just love your news.
I mean, I really hate the news, but, oh, the way you do it - Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- I wonder, would you?
My pleasure.
Is there anything special you want me to write?
Yes.
To the most well-informed woman I have ever met.
That'll just destroy my husband.
Oh.
Oh.
- Um, is she, uh - Yes, she is.
Oh, would you mind?
Oh, thank you so much.
You're welcome.
- I shouldn't have done that.
- What's the harm?
Well, I didn't want to disappoint her, so I wrote the first name that came into my mind Ringo Starr.
Mrs. Ringo Starr.
I didn't want her to spend the whole afternoon trying to figure out who Mary Richards is.
Well, I can think of worse ways to spend an afternoon.
Well, let's talk about you.
Before Vietnam, weren't you in Russia?
Yes.
Are you involved with anyone right now?
- No.
How about some dessert?
- I'm sorry.
I thought you were on a diet.
- What would you like?
- Actually, I was thinking about having the fettuccine.
- What would you like?
- Actually, I was thinking about having the fettuccine.
- Are you gonna throw those away?
- You want 'em?
Oh, yeah.
My girlfriend and I are pooling our trading stamps.
Look, in that case here.
What did you ever buy to get all these?
- My camper truck and everything to stock it with.
- A camper truck?
Yeah.
I thought I'd take some time off to just drive around the country.
- I haven't seen it for a long time.
- Oh.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- I'm married, Mary.
- Yes, I know.
Your ring.
- Does it bother you?
- It didn't bother me until you asked me if it bothered me.
I mean, I don't know why you even bring it up.
This is just a lunch, right?
I was thinking of it as a little more than just a lunch.
That's what it is.
Look rolls, butter, ice water, restaurant.
That's a lunch.
- Let me explain why I told you I'm married.
- It's none of my business.
The reason I told you I'm married is because I'm separated.
- Ah.
John, why don't we change the subject?
- All right.
If you're so separated, how come you're still wearing your wedding ring?
- That's a funny thing.
- Oh, is it?
I just can't seem to get it off.
- Go on, try it.
- Well, l No, I'll take your word for it.
I guess to get it off, I'll have to cut it off.
Oh, waiter, could I have a knife?
For my butter!
Oh, you think Oh, wouldn't that be just Look, all right, I'll admit he's intelligent, charming, good looking, really polite.
But the important thing is, I'm just not interested in him.
I know what you mean.
Looks, intelligence, charm - they turn me off too.
- Yeah.
Okay, think about this, Rhoda.
What happens when these separated men go back to their wives?
I don't know.
Maybe a little kissin', foolin' around.
I don't know.
I mean, to us!
Oh, Mary.
Rhoda, go home.
-  - Who is it?
- .
John Corcoran.
- Rhoda, stay right here.
- Well, hi, John.
- Hi.
- Uh, won't you come in?
- Thanks.
Uh, John, I'd like you to meet my roommate, Rhoda Morgenstern.
- Rhoda, this is John Corcoran.
- How do you do?
- Hi.
Got any more stamps?
-  What am I laughing at?
Everywhere I go, they keep shoving these things at me.
- Here.
- Ooh, great.
Uh, John and I had lunch together today.
Oh, yeah, I think you mentioned that.
Oh.
Oh, well, sit down, John.
- John's just back from Vietnam.
- I think you mentioned that.
He, um He just bought one of those, um, eh A camper.
You told me.
- To drive around the country.
- Yeah.
- Where're you from anyway?
- Los Angeles.
That is, my wife lives there.
We're separated.
I know.
I, uh I think I mentioned that.
Would anyone like some coffee?
None for me.
I just want to go to bed.
- I'm sorry.
I'm keeping you up.
- No, you're not.
All I have to do is go upstairs to my apartment.
- I thought you two were roommates.
- What makes you think that?
- Mary just said so.
- Oh.
She's right.
- John, how do you take your coffee?
- Black.
He took it black at lunch.
Oh, no!
- What are you doing?
- Uh, sweeping.
- I thought you were making coffee.
- I am, I am.
It's gonna taste a little strange though.
You can forget about the coffee.
No, really, I'll just make instant.
Why don't you go talk to Rhoda?
- It's a little difficult talking to Rhoda.
- Why?
She's asleep.
- I don't believe it!
- Like it or not, Mary, we're alone.
Uh, well, why don't we be alone out there?
I, uh I really should wake her and send her home.
- No, don't.
You'll feel better with her here, won't you?
- Uh, yes.
John, look, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being separated.
Maybe I'm being dumb, but there are all kinds of ways of being separated, you know?
I had an uncle who used to go to a convention for two weeks every year, and for those two weeks he was separated.
And then my aunt found out, and they were separated.
I'm not saying, you know, that you I don't know what I'm saying.
- You're saying it might be better if we don't see each other.
- Yes.
Okay.
We won't see each other again.
Good-bye, Mary.
- Good-bye, John.
- See you at the office.
Right.
What are you working on?
I think there might be an idea for a good documentary in this America, by someone who hasn't seen it for three years.
Who?
Jimmy Hoffa?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Am I in your way?
- No.
- If I am, I could use this end of the desk.
- You can have the rest.
- No, really, I never use the desk.
Okay.
Uh, excuse me.
My labels.
My addresses.
Mary, there's nothing wrong with sharing a desk with a separated man.
I know, I know.
It's just, I never use a desk.
Really.
Uh  - I'm working against a deadline, and you're putting labels in my typewriter!
- Shh!
Oh, Mary, look.
I was wondering about something.
Marie and I are having some people over Friday, and we want you to come.
Oh, good.
I'd love to.
If you're the kind of person who thinks they have to bring a bottle of wine or something, don't bother, we have all the wine we need.
- Okay.
- We're a little short on cognac though.
Hi, guys.
Hey, Johnny.
Don't get any ideas about taking over my job.
A sincere-looking chimp could take over his job.
- What's that, Murr?
- I said, a sincere-looking Ted, my wife and I are having some people over Friday night.
We thought you'd like to come.
Gee, Murr, Friday's the night I tape Sunday's News In Review.
- Aw, shucks!
- Sorry to disappoint you.
Good evening, good evening.
This is Ted Baxter.
Baxter.
He's never been able to figure out why we always have our parties on Friday nights.
Mary.
Hi, again.
- Yes, sir?
- Sit down.
- Did John say anything to you?
- About what?
He asked if I could spare you to help him on some research.
I said okay.
- He asked you for me?
- Mm-hmm.
- No.
- Huh?
No, sir, I can't.
We seem to have a little misunderstanding here.
What I just said was not a request.
He's a friend of mine, and he needs some help.
- I want you to help him.
Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
- Then I expect you to help him.
- No, sir.
I just - It would make things very uncomfortable for me.
- Why?
Uh, well, uh Oh.
I'm going to say something to you.
I hope you won't take it the wrong way.
You're the biggest jerk I ever met.
How could I possibly take that the wrong way?
You're a big girl, over 21 and then some.
Don't you know enough not to affiliate with charmers likeJohn Corcoran?
I didn't affiliate with him!
We had lunch, just one lunch.
I've seen him mess up three or four women's lives during a coffee break.
- You keep away from him!
- That's what I'm trying to do.
You're making it very hard for me.
I have to share a desk with him.
All right, all right!
It's my fault.
But how did I know you'd see anything in him?
I don't know what anyone sees in anybody.
But mind you, I likeJohn.
He's what you call a man's man.
- But that can be bad news if you're a lady.
- You mean, like his wife?
- He separated again?
- Again?
John and his wife have had more reunions than the Wiffenpoofs.
Maybe he's being straight with you.
One of these separations has to stick.
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Grant, but it really has nothing to do with me.
Good girl.
Not that he's a bad guy.
When I think of the times I've sat on a bar stool and sopped up his stories.
There was this girl in Chicago  If he so much as comes near you, you let me know.
Hi, again.
- Mary, it's disaster time.
- What?
They're preempting Sunday's News In Review for that Washington press conference.
- The president?
- No, the attorney general's wife.
- That means Ted can come to my dinner party!
- Oh, Murray.
Maybe he'll get lost!
- Mary, did Lou talk to you about - Oh, about my working for you?
- Yes.
- Well, yes, but he decided I have too much to do, so sorry.
Okay.
I'll see you Friday night though.
Well, John, I'm going to be busy Friday night.
I really am.
I'm going to - Murray's house.
- Murray's house.
- So am I. - Oh.
- Mary, would you care for a mint?
- No, thank you.
- Ah, that's good wine.
- You're drinking scotch.
That's my favorite kind of wine.
We were so sorry that your wife couldn't come.
Yeah, I know.
Well, we sort of have a kind of a deal.
She doesn't drag me to any of the dumb things she gets invited to, and I don't - Gee, Ted, it's - I think I'll have more of that scotch wine.
Ted, it's so nice seeing you outside of the office for a change.
Yes, well, some celebrities don't like to socialize with their coworkers, - but I feel it's good for morale.
- Oh.
- You're not talking to me.
- Well, certainly, I'm talking to you.
Of course I am.
Marie, the chop suey was fantastic.
- Oh, thank you.
- Speaking of things Oriental, when I was on assignment in the Far East last year, I found the natives very friendly - and our boys delighted to be there.
- Did you?
That's because he was in Hawaii.
You don't have to go to Vietnam to get a big story.
That's right.
Ted came back with a terrific piece on surfing.
- Thanks, Lou.
- I think Ted had the right idea.
All last year I had the feeling I was in the wrong place.
Not now though.
Marie, I just love what you've done with the house.
Oh, thank you.
Murray, honey, while I get the coffee, why don't you show everybody who wants to see it the rest of the place?
Love to!
Anybody else want to take the tour?
Please.
Well, I've already seen the house, of course.
- John, why don't you take the tour?
- No, thanks.
Not right now.
Follow me.
You know, I see this girl all day long, and all we ever talk about is business.
So for a change, I'd like to talk to her about something else.
And there are so many things to talk about.
There sure are.
- Did you get those books out of research?
- Yes, sir, I did.
- That's business, isn't it?
- But what's wrong with talking about business?
I think I'll go join the tour.
I'll see you soon.
Don't miss the master bathroom.
It's the highlight.
- Mr. Grant, thanks.
- For what?
- For what you did.
I appreciate it.
- Ahh.
But, Mr. Grant, don't do it again, okay?
It's tough to say "you're welcome" after a thank you like that.
Well, it's just that I've got to figure out how to handle this myself.
l I just wish he'd stop coming on like this in front of everybody.
Maybe I can figure out a subtle way of getting him under a cold shower.
I think so far you and I are probably the only ones aware of what's going on.
And this is the family room.
The tour is over.
Oh, this is nice.
We were here before, Ted.
Well, it's still nice!
- Game time!
- Games?
Sure, games.
What's a party without a few games?
You know, charades, association.
Oh, I thought you were gonna have us all get in sacks and hop across the room.
Hey, does anybody have any new games?
- How about the truth game?
- You know what's always fun?
Continuation.
- How about the truth game?
- You know what's always fun?
Continuation.
I think that's what it's called.
You must've played it.
Where somebody says a word, and then the person next to them has to use a word beginning with the last letter of your word.
- Sounds great.
- No, it really is.
Like, um, well, if you said "boy" then Ted would say "yellow," because yellow begins with "Y".
Do we just keep on doing this, or does the game have an end?
No, it ends.
It ends when someone's stumped.
Well, let's try it anyway.
I'll begin.
Box.
Well, let me see if I understand this.
I have to say a word that begins with the last letter of your word.
"X".
"X".
Game's over.
John, what was that truth game you mentioned?
- Well, Marie - It's very simple.
We each make a statement about ourselves.
Then it's up to everybody else to guess if that statement is true or false.
The whole point is to make your statement, uh, intriguing.
That way you get an idea of what people think about you.
Remember, the whole point is to say something provocative.
Let me try one.
I think I'm in love with a person in this room.
True!
A person in this room.
Now we'll have to spend the whole night figuring out who it is.
It's your turn, Mary.
My Okay.
All right, my turn.
I think that there is a person in this room who uses the word "love" - like other people use the word "hello".
- False.
- True.
- I didn't know this game could have ties.
Let me try another.
I'm seriously thinking of getting a divorce.
Oh, John.
No, you're not.
Would you believe it?
I'm usually good at this game.
Boy, did she wipe you out pretty good!
Come on.
What do you say we go back to the Lucky 7-11?
This time we'll really get some sake.
You wanna come, Mary?
Uh, no, thank you.
You're incredible.
You never give up.
You'll be pitchin' when they're nailin' the box closed on ya.
- Marie, Murray, thank you.
- Enjoyed the function.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, hey, wait a minute, wait a minute the game.
It's my turn.
"X".
Extra.
-  - Who is it?
Rhoda.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I was just coming in and saw your light.
- How was Murray's party?
- Well, it turned into a sort of farewell party.
- Oh, yeah?
For who?
- John and me.
You mean no more stamps?
Aw, Mary, our partnership has just bombed.
- It'll take us a year to get an electric blender now.
- I think I have a plan.
Why don't we split the books?
You take six, I'll take six.
We'll each get what we want.
- Great.
- I'm gonna get the baseball mitt.
- What?
- For my nephew's birthday.
- Oh.
Hey, I'm gonna get one of these.
- Oh, the barbecue?
No, the guy in the chef's hat standing behind it.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all - Things a little slow today, Murr?
- Yeah.
- How would like an exclusive story?
- I'd love it.
My fan club is having its annual Ted Baxter Bridge Tournament tonight.
Oh, that's exclusive, all right.
Last year they couldn't find a fourth.
- Mar, would you like to play?
- I would.
I'd like to.
But I've got an aunt from my hometown coming in.
I'm gonna take her to dinner and a movie.
Well, why don't you bring her to a TV show?
I don't think there are a lot of famous TV shows done here in Minneapolis.
Wait a minute, Mary.
I think you're missing Ted's point.
I think she'd find it inspiring to watch a topflight newscaster in action.
I mean, not just reading the news, but the inside stuff wardrobe, makeup, the way I make that fist before I go on.
- You know, all that inside stuff.
- Uh-huh.
- Mary, did you finish that letter?
- Yes, sir.
I'll get it for you.
What are you doing here?
Just trying to keep up the troop's morale, Lou.
Does he really believe that?
Incredible.
- Here it is, Mr. Grant.
- Oh, thanks.
Fix me a drink, will ya?
He can fix his own drink.
I'm not a bartender.
- What did you say?
- Nothing, nothing.
Murray!
Mr. Grant, there is an intercom.
Yeah, I know.
But I figure this way, it's more personal.
Did you write up that story, the South American revolution?
Yeah, I have a standard story.
I just fill in the name of the country, the names of the generals, et cetera.
- Mm.
-  Yes, I know.
I'm going home and change my dress before I meet my aunt.
You better.
You smell like a distillery.
A great distillery.
Help!
- Mary, did you just call for help?
- Yes!
- What is it?
What's the matter?
- My My clothes!
Oh, I see what you mean.
You smell like you've been dancing with Dean Martin.
No!
Not these clothes, those clothes.
My closet.
- Oh.
Is it safe?
- Yes.
Mary, I heard you yell for help.
I would've come sooner, but I had something in the oven.
What's wrong?
There's something in Mary's closet.
There's nothing in Mary's closet.
- Where are your clothes?
- Gone!
Everything in the closet is gone.
Mary, call the police.
Right.
I've got to call the police.
I hope they get here in a hurry.
My poor aunt is waiting for me on a street corner.
- Let me handle this.
If you want the cops fast, I can get 'em here fast.
- Great.
Hello, police.
There's a man with a gun trying to get into my apartment.
- Rhoda!
- Mary Richards, 119 North Wetherley, apartment D. - Rhoda, you can't - Hurry!
He's coming in!
He's pulling the phone out of my hand!
Well, they should be here shortly.
Rhoda, I don't think you should've done that.
Oh, they don't mind.
They get calls like that all day long.
Oh, I can't tell you how creepy I feel to know that there was some stranger in here breathing heavily and pawing at my things with his hairy arms.
- How do you know he's got hairy arms?
- Oh, I just know.
- What did he take, Mary?
- Everything.
All my clothes.
Everything.
Even my brand-new cape that I haven't finished paying for yet.
It won't do any good to get angry with him.
Criminals are misunderstood enough to begin with.
Yeah?
Stealing my cape is not gonna help him in his quest for understanding.
Especially if he wears it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Whoever did it was drinking heavily at the time.
- No, Phyllis.
That's Mary.
And this is it.
I haven't got a thing to wear.
That's probably the first time a woman has ever said that and it's really been true.
- I'll loan you something.
- You can borrow a dress from me.
Oh, thank you.
You are both so thoughtful.
Yes, Rhoda, that's very thoughtful of you, dear, but Mary and I have the same taste good.
Nothing!
Nothing, nothing.
- Nothing.
-  That was really rotten.
Poor Mary.
It's all right.
We're gonna get something for you.
- Excuse me.
-  Oh, thank goodness.
- Where is he?
-  Who?
- You made a phone call?
- I did not.
- Who made the phone call?
- She did.
- She dialed.
- Who lives here?
-  She lives here.
- I live downstairs.
She lives upstairs.
- Officers?
Listen, you can put the guns away, because about the phone call, actually, we were just, uh, kidding about the gunman part.
You were kidding about a gunman?
Hey, fellas, let's look at the positive side.
True, there's no gunman.
But there was a robbery.
If there was no gunman, why did you say there was a gunman?
She wanted you to come quickly.
What else you girls do for laughs?
Turn in false alarms?
-  - Oh, that's me over here.
I wasn't drinking it.
I just spilled it on my person.
Uh - Would you like to see the scene of the crime?
- Tully, see what's missing.
- It's right in here.
- Yeah, I'll check.
Officer, I'm Phyllis Lindstrom, and I'm aware that all over the country there is controversy concerning the police.
I just want you to know that I have an open mind.
- That's nice.
- Jackson, there's certainly a lot missing in that closet.
Oh?
Could I have your name, please?
Yes, sir.
It's Mary Richards, and I am the rob-ee.
Victim.
- Rhoda Morgenstern.
I'm her friend.
- Officer Tully.
I'm Phyllis Lindstrom.
I live downstairs.
Nice to meet you.
We met in the closet.
This is OfficerJackson.
If we're through with the introductions, would you girls like to sit down?
I'd like to ask Miss Richards exactly what happened.
- Miss Richards, exactly what happened?
- I was robbed.
Somebody came into my apartment and stole all of my clothes.
And my TV!
At least they didn't take your records.
That's right.
At least they did not take my records.
But they took my stereo.
Oh!
Aw, gee, that's too bad.
What time did this happen?
I don't know.
It must've been while I was at work.
Oh, then you weren't robbed.
- I wasn't?
- You were burglarized.
Oh!
That's a relief.
Officers, continue your questioning.
- Mary, I'm gonna get you a dress.
- I'll get you a better one.
When did you first realize that there was a robbery?
- A burglary!
- When I came home about ten minutes ago and looked in my closet and noticed that there was nothing in it.
- Is there anyone you suspect?
- No.
Jackson.
No suspects.
This next question that I am going to ask you, you may think it's a very personal type of question.
But for those of us who have taken the exam to be a detective, as we know, it has to be asked.
Does anyone else have a key to your apartment?
No.
I didn't think so.
Jackson!
There's something very intriguing about this case.
Yeah, I wonder what.
Leave the detecting to the detectives.
- I want to talk to you for a minute.
- Excuse me.
Just be right Do you always have to put me down in front of people?
- Only when you start acting like Ironside.
- You're acting like Ironside.
Officers, I do hate to seem to be rushing things, but I really have to get going.
It'll just be a few more minutes.
Jackson, why don't you check the window sash?
- Mary, here's a dress for you.
It's brand new, never been worn.
- Oh, Phyl Here it is.
It has 10,000 miles on it, but it's just back from the cleaners.
- Right.
Come on.
- Oh, but That's the breaks, Phyl.
- Tully, come on!
- Would you wait a second?
I want to see how she looks in it.
Officer Tully, you know, Bess that's my daughter Oh, OfficerJackson should be here.
He would appreciate this.
Bess came home from school the other day and she said, "The The policeman is our friend".
That's very nice.
I'll tell OfficerJackson.
You know what I said to Bess?
I said, "Bess, you're absolutely right".
Gives you an idea of the fantastic conversations they have at her house.
Well, one thing's good Mary won't have to worry about being robbed again.
Oh, that's not necessarily true.
You see, many times they come back to the same place.
Do me a favor.
Don't tell Mary that.
I heard!
- Is that true?
- Oh, you look terrific.
- That's a great color for you.
- Thank you.
- Is that true what you said, that they sometimes come back?
- Oh, seldom, very seldom.
And if you need any help, just call and ask for 1636.
All right, extension 1636.
- No, no.
Badge 1636.
- Badge.
- I don't have an extension.
- Oh.
- Nice meeting you girls.
-  We'll have to do this again sometime.
- Bye, Mary.
Uh - Thank you.
I hope your aunt doesn't think that's a maternity dress.
- Hi, Mr. Grant.
-  Thank you for giving me the extra half hour.
I think I got some really good dresses.
- Anything big happening around here?
- Nothing.
The biggest story of the day is that somebody talked at the Paris peace talks.
I never realized what a hassle being robbed could be.
The man at the insurance agency - acted as though he thought I did it.
- Did you settle a claim yet?
- Yeah, I signed yesterday and got the check today - Eh?
for about 20% of what my clothes were worth.
- At least they paid off quickly.
- Yes, and then they canceled my policy.
That figures.
They love ya as long as you never have a claim.
- Hey, Mar, did you buy some new clothes?
- Oh, yes.
Oh, I bought a sport coat that color.
Brings out my eyes.
Which one?
The blue or the pink?
Start writin'.
Red China just signed a mutual defense pact with Albania.
Albania?
That's the capital of New York, isn't it?
Well, I've got to go watch a show on educational television.
Sesame Street.
That reminds me, there's some really great television on tonight.
And I won't be able to watch it.
They stole my TV.
- You can come over to our place and watch it.
- Oh, thanks, Murray.
No, I guess I'll just stay home and have a good time listening to my records.
No.
No, I'll just stay home and have a good time cleaning my oven.
Help!
We'll get whoever did this, I promise you.
That's what you said the first time.
Being hysterical will not do you any good.
Well, being calm didn't do me any good either.
Everything'll be all right, Mar l You coward.
- We'll need a list of what's missing.
- Everything!
A pattern's beginning to emerge.
Yes!
The pattern is, this guy keeps coming back and robbing me!
- Burglarizing.
- Oh!
Whatever you call it, when is he gonna stop?
I think he's about finished.
Well, you still have your lamp, your sofa and that "M" thing.
Wait a minute, fellas.
If this kid gets hit again, - the Red Cross is gonna have to come in with coffee and doughnuts.
-  Hi.
I saw the police car downstairs, and I wondered what happened.
- Oh, Mary, your apartment.
Oh - I know.
You.
It's your job to protect innocent citizens from things like this.
Look Look at that poor girl.
What kind of a police department do we have here anyway?
We're doing our very best, Phyllis.
Did you notice any strange people around here today?
Just the usual.
Wait a second.
Wait a second.
As I was leaving for my Esperanto class, I saw a big truck parked right out in front.
I didn't think anything about it at the time.
Can you describe this, uh, big truck?
Uh, yes, Officer.
It was a, uh, a truck.
- Big.
- Phyllis, please try, because the only hope of getting my things back is if you can remember.
- So, Phyllis, if you could - It was blue.
- Good, good.
- Or was it green?
I don't know.
I didn't see it.
I guess it was blue-green sort of an off-blue-green.
Not unlike the color of my new hostess gown.
Why don't you give them a swatch?
Was there anything else you noticed besides the blue-green?
- Uh, that and the license number.
- The license number?
- You wrote down the license number?
That's terrific!
- No, I didn't write it down.
- I remembered it.
- You remembered all those numbers and all those letters?
- I just have one of those minds.
- She does.
She has one of those minds.
All right, all right.
What's the number?
B-B-7 Good.
I'll put in an alert for this big truck.
Jackson, put in an alert for that big truck.
A major clue.
To have a license plate and the color - Great!
- We're really making headway.
Officer Tully, I want to apologize for acting so emotionally before.
- You're doing a great job.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Well, you know, when you're studying to be a detective, you kind of get a sixth sense for these things.
- Mary, you know what you need, kid?
A good night's sleep.
- Yeah.
- Why don't you stay at my place?
- You're welcome to sleep at my place.
- Or even stay at - Don't say it.
I am on duty here.
Why can't my partner learn to use the horn?
Just a little beep.
That's all you need.
Oh, I can't forget the old superstition about bad things coming in threes.
I walked into my apartment last night, I looked everywhere, even the refrigerator.
- A little bit of paranoia is a character developer.
- Oh!
I haven't slept more than a couple of hours the last few days.
I keep thinking he's gonna come back and steal my sofa too.
Look, Mar, I don't know if you can use any of this.
- We've had it around for quite a while.
- Oh, Murray!
They're practically antiques.
- This is an alarm clock.
It's so old, it has Roman numerals.
- Oh, Murray!
Here is a waffle iron, in case you have any waffles you want to iron.
Oh, that's great.
Murray, that's so sweet.
Thank you.
- Well, it was all Marie's idea.
- Ah!
- Morning, Murray.
- Morning, Lou.
- Good morning, Mr. Grant.
- Mary.
I don't like the coffee it makes.
Maybe you will.
Will you look at this?
This pot has never been used.
He bought it for me.
Well, don't tell anyone.
You'll ruin his image.
Heigh-ho, everyone.
I think you can quit worrying.
The third bad thing just happened.
A little something to help you rebuild, Mar.
- It's for your kitchen.
- Oh, Ted!
- It's an ice crusher.
- Oh, Ted, that's sensational.
I've always wanted an ice crusher, but it's the kind of thing you never think to go out and buy for yourself.
Thank you.
Is it electric or manual?
All right.
So it isn't one of those big, electric fancy ones.
- What's wrong with that?
- Calling that an ice crusher is like giving someone a match and calling it a barbecue.
Here, Mar, I'll show you how it works.
You put an ice cube in your hand, and then you strike it like this and voila.
-  - I've always wanted to know what "voila" meant, and now I know.
It means, "I've got a handful of crushed ice".
- You're some joker!
- Thank you, Ted.
- The last of the big spenders.
- Come on.
It's the thought that counts.
I know, and he has cheap thoughts.
Newsroom, Mary Richards.
Uh, Larry?
Larry, Larry Larry Tully.
Officer Larry Tully.
Well, I'm fine, thanks.
You did?
Oh, that's great.
Yes, thank you.
Yes, I'll be right there.
Good-bye.
That was my policeman, Officer Larry Tully.
They think they got the guy who did the robbery.
I have to go to the police station.
Hey, that's great.
Now that you know the guy's been caught, maybe you won't be so nervous.
Oh, come on, Murray.
I was never really nervous.
All right, let's see here.
Uh, Richards, Richards - "Mary Richards, breaking and entering".
- Yes, that's me.
Tully said that if you got here before him to wait.
- Would you like a magazine?
- Oh, thank you very much.
Uh, don't he look like a nice fella?
Wanted for murder, assault and armed robbery.
Triple threat.
You just can't tell anything about anybody by looking at 'em.
Mm.
True.
You know what I do every morning?
Get up and go over the park and sit on a bench.
Ever since I was a little kid, I've seen old men sittin' on park benches.
It's kind of boring, but I figure it's my obligation.
That's very nice.
- What are you here for?
- Robbery.
- Really?
- No.
No, I was robbed uh, burglarized.
Eh, that's bad.
A lot of that going around.
Especially in my apartment.
Huh!
Happened to me twice.
Hm!
I've been mugged 13 times.
Well, you certainly don't look it.
Oh, I guess I'm just mug prone.
Course, hanging around the park doesn't help.
You'd think those muggers would go to a nicer neighborhood, - so they could make a better living.
-  Yes.
Tell me, have you ever been to one of these identifications before?
Thirteen times.
You just go in that room over there, and they line the guys up.
It's better than sittin' on a park bench.
Yeah.
I'm gonna have a pretty difficult time identifying this man.
- How come?
- I've never seen him before.
That'll make it tough all right.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Jerry.
- Hi.
- Well, what do you think?
How do you like it?
- What?
Oh, congratulations.
You made detective.
No, it's just a new suit.
Oh, well, you certainly should be a detective.
- Thank you.
- Uh, do I have to see the burglar?
- No.
- Oh, good.
One thing Did he have hairy arms?
- Yes.
- I knew it!
Now, we just want you to identify some of your things.
- You got my things back?
- Well, we think so.
How did you do it?
That's terrific.
Well, Jackson and I had just come on duty, and we were cruising when we spotted the truck.
And you recognized it from Phyllis's description?
No, they had changed the license plate, but there was still something suspicious about it.
They were trying to make people think they were one of those charity groups.
Well, that certainly was pretty tricky of them, wasn't it?
Well, it would have been, except for the name they had printed on the truck the Salvation Navy.
- Stupid, stupid people.
- The worst!
- Well, I think you did a wonderful job.
- Thank you.
You know, this man is a wonderful policeman.
- He really should be made detective.
- I'll see what I can do.
- He's the same rank as I am.
- Get the receipts for everything she takes.
- Right.
- My TV set!
- Your alleged TV set.
And my alleged clothes!
Oh, great!
- The rest of the stuff is down at the warehouse.
- Oh!
- Hello, Miss Richards.
- Oh, hello, OfficerJackson.
Did Officer Tully tell you you'll have to leave one of your dresses for evidence?
- No.
- Oh, yes.
Oh.
Well, here.
Uh No, that's my favorite.
I wanna wear that tomorrow.
All right.
- This one.
- You know, I like that one.
- Do you like that one?
Yeah.
- It's nice.
Phyllis!
Mary, I'm sorry to startle you.
I just came up to get my dress.
I need it for tonight.
- How did you get in?
- Oh, well, I used my nail file.
Mary, your lock is really easy to pick.
No wonder you're getting knocked over so often.
Phyl, couldn't you have waited until I got home?
I didn't know how late you'd be.
Lars and I are going to the SCARD convention.
Phyl, uh  what-what is, uh, SCARD?
- SCARD.
S-C-A-R-D.
- Uh-huh.
SCARD the Society of Concerned and Responsible Dermatologists.
Lars is speaking on the social implications of dandruff.
- That certainly sounds exciting.
- Would you like to come, Mary?
I've got an extra ticket.
- No, no.
No, I've got a date.
- I'll get you two tickets.
- It's a double date.
- I'll get you four tickets.
Actually, Phyl, uh, the four of us are, uh, going to a large dinner party, so If you really want 'em, I can scrape up 50 tickets.
Phyl, there are 52 of us.
So, have a good time.
Tough luck, Mary.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all My photographer says he's having a heck of a time.
Almost sent me Cary Grant's pictures by mistake.
For some zany reason, he thinks I look like Cary Grant.
Except he's got a deeper cleft.
Yes.
You know, I keep leaving little notes to myself remember, Cary is the one with the deep cleft.
Not that mine is shallow, mind you.
It's just that his is so abnormally deep.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Long lunch hour, Mar?
- Uh, no, no.
I wasn't at lunch all that time.
I had a doctor's appointment.
Murray, do you think you could take over the production charts for me for a couple of days?
- I'm gonna be out.
- Sure.
Is anything wrong?
No.
No, hey, no.
Everything is just fine.
I just, uh I'm going into the hospital.
- Hospital.
Are you okay?
- Tell us everything, Mar.
What's wrong?
Maybe she doesn't want to talk about it.
Why shouldn't she want to talk about it?
Sometimes people don't want to talk about these things.
Oh.
Mary, sometimes it helps to talk about these things.
Look, Murray, it it is so inconsequential.
It isn't even anything.
I'm only gonna be gone a couple of days.
Is Mr. Grant in his office?
I have to have him sign a couple of forms.
- Yes, he's in there.
- Okay.
Uh, Mar.
Mar, I may be a little out of line, but before you do anything drastic in a hospital, I just want to say that I like your nose the way it is.
What are you going into the hospital for?
Oh, Mr. Grant, I don't want to take up any more of your time.
Mary.
If you want me to sign this hospitalization form, I have to know what I'm signing.
And you haven't filled in the part about why you're going in.
It's, uh, it's not one of those woman subjects?
Uh, no.
- It's not dangerous?
- No.
So what is it?
Can't you give me a little hint?
Mr. Grant, it's just it's such a teensy, little thing.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that where it says, "Reason for hospitalization," they'll accept "teensy, little thing".
Okay.
- I'll tell you.
- No calls.
I'm having my tonsil out.
Your tonsil?
Calls.
See, I had them out when I was a kid, but one of them grew back.
I told you it was just a teensy, little thing.
Mm-hmm.
So what are you making such a big deal out of it for?
I'm not making a big deal.
I told you it was a teensy, little thing.
Calling it a teensy, little thing made a big deal out of it.
How come you're keeping it such a big secret?
It's a little embarrassing to be having your tonsils out when you're 30.
Oh, yeah.
'Cause it's something only kids have done.
Right, and on top of that, it's only one tonsil.
Mm-hmm.
Well, let me put your mind at ease.
Any time you're having a tonsil out at your age, it can be pretty serious.
Well, I mean, any time you're lying on an operating table, and there's some guy with a knife standing over you See, that's another reason that I wasn't particularly anxious to talk about it.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Look, forget what I said.
It's just a kids' operation.
Still, I'm very nervous about it.
I have a thing about hospitals.
I know it's silly, but No, I know how you feel.
Can I see you for a second?
I need you to check out this story.
- Come on in.
- Just came in over the wire.
- "Tonsils"!
- Oh, I don't believe it!
If you didn't want us to be curious, you shouldn't have made a big deal out of it.
Tonsils?
Well, that's nothing.
Something kids get.
Nothing like my operation.
What did you have, a lobotomy?
I don't know.
- Well, what was it, Ted?
- Surgery.
Well, you don't think you're born with a face like this, do you?
- Aaah!
- Happy tonsil day!
Rhoda, it's not today.
It's tomorrow.
- All right then.
Happy tonsil eve.
-  - How long you gonna keep this up?
- Keep what up, Mary?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I got an anonymous gift certificate for ice cream yesterday.
I figured it was from you.
Listen, I meant to tell you, there's a toy ambulance parked downstairs.
- Is that for you?
- Are you finished?
No, I got one more.
Now, little Mary Richards, you're going bye-bye to a nice, white room.
Yes, you are.
You put your little "headie"down and go to sleep and have sweet dreams.
And then the tonsil fairy comes.
- And he yanks out your throat!
- Oh, Rhoda!
Now I'm finished.
Good, 'cause it really isn't so funny.
Having your tonsils out at our age can be dangerous.
At our age, having your hair done could be dangerous.
Mary, please relax.
Stop worrying about it.
It's just a kids' thing.
No, no, Rhoda, it's a kids' thing if a kid is having it done.
If I'm having it done, it's a grown-up Mary thing.
I don't know.
Seems to me a couple of days in the hospital would be a nice rest, especially if you have a good roommate.
I'll probably have some brave little six-year-old.
Let's hope it's somebody I can get along with.
I know what you mean, Mar.
When I went in, I was hoping I'd have a roommate I could get along with, but I ended up with a woman.
You know, why don't you get a private room?
No, my insurance only covers semiprivate.
It'll be nice to have a roommate, somebody to talk to.
-  If you can talk.
- Rhoda!
Mary, it's gonna be great.
Lounging around, being waited on hand and foot, lying in bed in your fantastically sexy nightgown.
What fantastically sexy nightgown?
I'm glad you asked that question.
Here is your going-to-the-hospital present.
Try and guess what it is.
Right!
Rhoda, if this is a pair of pajamas with feet in it, I'll kill you.
Nope.
No, uh, feet in that.
Rhoda, listen, it's really beautiful, but, y you know, to wear this in a hospital, you have to have led an entirely different life from the kind I've led.
Now, listen to me, Mary.
You're going to a hospital where there's 600 bored, restless women.
There'll be, like, 12 interns, maybe 2 residents.
That's it.
In a situation like that, you take any edge you can get.
Listen, Rhoda, it is it's beautiful, really.
But I think I'll save it for another time.
-  - Uh, there's the cab.
Will you put the stationery in the bag for me?
Sure.
You won't forget to pick up my mail, will you?
No, I won't forget.
Let me walk you downstairs.
- Okay.
- Let me carry that for you.
Oh, she didn't argue.
You know, Mary, if your operation goes well, I'm thinking of having 11 pounds of fat removed surgically.
- Miss Richards?
- l- I'm in here changing.
Your roommate is switching rooms.
She'll be with you in a minute.
Take either bed.
- Oh, Rhoda!
- Something the matter?
No, no, no.
It's just something a friend of mine did.
- You got a friend in there?
- No.
No, no.
Everything is, uh, just fine.
Hi.
Oh, swell.
They didn't tell me I'd be rooming with a go-go dancer.
Am I in time for the supper show, or have you gone on already?
You mean this nightgown thing?
Well, it's not really mine.
Yeah.
Well, this isn't mine either.
I borrowed it from Princess Grace.
Listen, I was just wondering which bed you'd like.
Either one is fine with me.
You know, if there is anything I love, it is long debates concerning bed assignments when I'm standing here on crutches.
Right.
Yes.
I'll take this bed.
- Unless you'd rather have - What difference does it make?
- You're right.
- Right, right.
Yes.
- I'm, uh, Mary Richards.
- Wonderful.
- C-Can I help you?
- I can do it myself.
I was a little nervous when I came in and I saw the empty bed.
Boy, you can sure use company in a hospital.
Uh-huh.
I understand that you were in another room.
- Mm-hmm.
- Wh- What was it like?
- Pretty much like this one, I guess.
- Mm-hmm.
So how come, uh, you changed rooms?
Because of my roommate.
- Your roommate?
- Yeah, she kept wanting to talk.
Hello!
Want a TV?
Oh, isn't that nice?
Yes, thank you, I'd like one.
- Oh, good.
I get TV for nothing.
- Isn't that nice?
- I didn't know they did that.
- They don't.
You didn't think you got it for free, did you?
Oh, no.
No, no.
No, I knew that.
Let's see, I wonder how much it could be.
Brand-new TV only costs, what, $200.
If they charge you a dollar a day - 7.50.
- 7.50?
- Hello.
- Oh, sir.
l I'm only gonna be in here for a few days, so I won't need the TV.
Oh.
Oh, that's swell.
You are just beautiful!
Here you get me all hyped up for TV, then you don't want it.
O-On the other hand, what can it cost?
I'll only be in here for a couple of days.
Good.
This is your remote control.
It shows you how to work it.
Remote control.
Oh, sir, could you tilt that just a little bit this way?
Move it over just a little bit.
That's fine.
Just perfect.
For 300 points, who is the prime minister of Canada?
- Marvelous.
Yes, that's marvelous.
-  So you're coming to visit.
Would you turn the sound down on the TV set?
Look, Bert, just because I broke my leg does not mean that we are gonna patch things up.
Bert, listen, I can't talk.
There's this go-go dancer here hanging on to every word I say.
Oh, yeah, okay, marvelous.
So you're coming to visit tomorrow.
Right, I'll circle it on my calendar.
Bye-bye.
Well, did you enjoy the conversation?
Mrs. Kuhne, you know, it's pretty hard not to hear a conversation when you're just a couple of feet away.
Listen, we're gonna be in here for a couple of days together.
Don't you think it'd make life a lot pleasanter if we both kind of relaxed?
-  - Hey, how 'bout some candy?
Relax.
Relax.
There is a laugh for you.
I go on my first vacation in eight years, go on a skiing weekend, and the next five minutes, I break my leg.
- Were you just a beginner?
- I didn't even get that far.
Fell on the ice getting out of the car.
However, I am not here for a broken leg.
I'm here for an ulcer.
- An ulcer?
- Yeah.
The broken leg aggravated the ulcer my husband gave me.
You've just had one thing right on top of the other.
I don't know how you Excuse me.
Excuse me.
You have probably noticed by now that I am not exactly Miss Congeniality.
So why don't you just go back to your bed, hmm?
Honestly, wouldn't you really much rather watch the tube than listen to me?
- Not really.
- What are you, weird?
I mean, do you really enjoy listening to people tell you what's wrong with them?
Besides, it's not that serious.
Just an ulcer and a broken leg.
Unless my allergy to chocolates flares up.
- What are you in for?
- Why don't we turn on the TV?
I wonder if they get all the channels here.
It's after 6:00.
There is one show I just cannot miss.
Oh, I gotta see that.
Ted Baxter and the news.
You're kidding.
Well, this is the most fantastic coincidence.
Go on.
Guess what I do for a living.
And I'd like to make a correction on the correction I made yesterday.
It seems I was originally correct, so the correction I made was, uh, incorrect.
- What an idiot.
-  I tell you, this show gives me the biggest laugh of my day.
So what do you do for a living?
I'm a stewardess.
- Good morning.
- Hi.
I, uh, just wanted to drop in and say hello before we go into surgery.
I hope everything goes all right.
Well, that's, uh, gonna be more or less up to you, isn't it?
Oh, no, I'm your anesthesiologist.
No, I just knock you out.
Well, it's certainly very nice of you to drop by like this.
Well, I try to make a habit of it.
- Oh, what's this?
- That's my bill.
But you haven't done anything yet.
I know, but I'm the first person that everybody forgets about when they get out of the hospital.
People, you know, plan on going to see their doctor again, so he gets paid.
But, uh, who ever wants to see me again, right?
Well, do you expect me to pay you n-now?
Oh, no, you don't have to, unless you want to.
Uh, no, I think I'd just as soon wait.
Hmm.
I didn't think you'd want to.
Well, good-bye.
I guess I won't be seeing you again.
Listen, l-I'll pay my bill.
I promise.
- I hope you mean that.
- Oh, I do, I do.
Hi, Mary!
Hey, you're lookin' great, kid.
- Ohh.
- How do you feel?
- Fine.
- Hey, that's some terrific nightgown.
- I'll get you for this.
- Hi, Mary's roommate.
Oh, Mrs. Kuhne, I would like you to meet my friend Rhoda Morgenstern.
Wonderful.
I am going to go freshen up, which, in my case, could take a week.
At least you didn't get a six-year-old kid for a roommate.
Poor lady.
Her whole life is such a mess.
She's got a bad leg and a bad marriage and a bad stomach.
Speaking of stomachs, how's your throat?
Oh, pretty good.
It went very well.
- It's just a little sore here.
- Good.
Listen, I brought you some ice cream, but I see you already have some.
Yes, I've been having some all day.
Rhoda, I couldn't look at another spoonful.
Oh, I would have been here earlier, but as I came in the hospital, I stupidly took a wrong turn and ended up where?
The doctors' lounge.
Whoo-hoo-hoo.
Which reminds me, I brought your bed jacket.
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Mary.
Your ice cream's gonna melt.
I'm gonna go see if I can find a refrigerator.
- Okay.
Thanks.
- Be right back.
Oh!
- Hello.
- Hi.
I'm here to see Loretta.
- You-You must be Bert.
- Yeah.
You must be the go-go dancer.
I'm not a go-go dancer.
- Loretta said you were a dancer.
- No, I'm a s-stewardess.
Which airline?
- I freelance.
- Freelance?
Hi, Loretta.
Nobody could ever make me believe you're sick.
You look absolutely terrific.
You said that about Cincinnati.
I'm just trying to say how nice you look.
You don't lose an ounce of your appeal to me, even with that broken leg.
That's too bad.
Hey, Loretta, I brought you a new book.
Try to guess what it is.
- The Sensuous Woman.
- Yeah.
I read it.
Found it in a wastepaper basket in the maternity ward.
-  - Hello.
- Hiya, Mary.
- What do you say, Mary?
- Gee, you look terrific.
- Hey, you didn't have to come.
- We know, but we wanted to.
- We missed you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Murray Slaughter and, uh, Mr. Grant, I'd like you to meet Bert and Loretta Kuhne.
- Wonderful.
- What do you say?
I brought you some ice cream.
Hope you like vanilla.
Oh, I do.
A lot.
You better.
Hey, Mary, I found a refrigerator.
Looks like I have to make another trip.
Hi, Murray.
How are you?
I don't mind making another trip.
The refrigerator is in the doctors' lounge.
I'll come back and say good-bye before I leave, if I ever leave that lounge.
- Pleasant person.
- Yes.
- How are you feeling?
How'd it go?
- Oh, just fine.
Just a little, uh, sore.
- Great.
- Great.
And how's everything at the old salt mines?
- Great.
- Great.
Uh, so when are these visiting hours over?
Oh, uh, I guess the nurse will probably come and tell us.
- Oh.
- Yeah, probably.
There's only one chair, Lou.
You wanna take it?
No, no, you take it.
I've been sittin' all day.
Go on.
Yeah, I'm sure it'll all work out.
Bye-bye.
Excuse me.
Bert, what are you writing all over my cast for?
You're supposed to sign a cast.
You guys wanna sign it?
- I don't know.
- Come on.
Write on it.
- We got a whole leg to fill up.
- Okay.
- Come on.
You too.
- You sign for me, Murray.
Bert, I would like to thank you very much for making me feel like Grauman's Chinese Theater.
I come down to cheer you up, and this is what I get?
Bert, will you hold it down?
Just hold it down.
Excuse me!
Bert, what are you doing here?
I don't even know that man.
You have an absolute stranger signing my leg.
So, uh, everything went okay, huh?
Just fine.
Good evening, everybody.
Good to see you all.
Will you cut that TVset down in there?
I don't feel like listening to that idiot do the news right now!
- What idiot?
What did she mean?
- Nothing, nothing.
- We probably should hold it down though.
- Who's behind there anyway?
Listen, Bert, is it so hard to understand?
I just don't feel like exercising in my cast right now.
It would do you good.
Besides, that's what's making you so tense.
I enjoy being tense, but if it's gonna worry you, why don't you leave?
- Then I'll feel a lot less tense.
- Visiting hours are over.
But I won't say anything if you want to stay an extra ten minutes.
No!
No, rules are rules.
If visiting hours are over, we'd better go.
- Yeah, uh, I'll see you next week, Mary.
- Okay.
You look terrific.
- Stop goofing off and get back to work.
- Thank you.
I'd like to know who it is back there called me an idiot.
- I'm gonna leave now.
- Good.
- Loretta, I won't be alone out there.
- Yeah, I know.
Say hello to your mother.
Hey, Bert!
Hey, Bert, listen.
Come on back.
It's just I've been feeling so Hey, Bert!
- Bert!
- Hey, uh, Bert!
Mrs. Kuhne.
So you have any idea what this whole thing's gonna cost you?
No, they give you the bill on the way out.
They don't just give you the bill.
They shake you by your heels till they get their money.
Too bad your tonsil took this long to give out.
Why couldn't this have happened while your body was still under warranty?
Listen, Rhoda, why don't you go on downstairs.
I'll meet you in a minute.
- I want to wait for Mrs. Kuhne.
- Where is Mary Poppins today?
She's having her cast replastered.
Her cast replastered?
Well, her husband Bert wrote his name all over it.
Since they've split for good, she's covering it up.
Hmm, covering it up, huh?
Sure.
That's how you know when a relationship is over when you get your cast replastered.
- This has been the strangest few days.
- How do you mean strange?
Well, I mean, I've practically lived with her.
I listened to her fights, I overheard her phone conversations.
And we hardly know each other.
We're perfect strangers still.
Mary, if you're thinking you should get to know her better, forget it.
The Statue of Liberty would turn that woman away.
It's just a funny feeling when you know you're not gonna see anybody again.
- Do you know that feeling?
- Sure.
I get it a lot on first dates.
Mrs. Kuhne.
Good-bye.
Mrs. Kuhne, I'm back, because even though we didn't really get to know each other, - still in all - Look, I know what you're trying to say.
And I'll take two boxes of your cookies.
Okay, Mrs. Kuhne.
I give up.
You win.
Terrific.
Wonderful.
I wanted to be friends, and you didn't want to, so you you won.
The only thing I don't understand, Mrs. Kuhne, is, uh, wh-what did you win?
Nothing.
Look, I've, uh I've kind of been out of it.
You know, between the Bert thing and the leg and my ulcer, it all, uh, kind of got to me, and I got kind of well, you know.
Mary, you may not know this, and it may hit you ten minutes from now, but I'm apologizing.
No, hey, it hit me right away.
Listen, good-bye and good luck.
- All the best.
- Right.
Oh, say, Mary, listen, uh Before you leave, could you do me a favor?
Could you tell me where you got that nightgown, you know, the go-go thing?
- You're kidding.
You really wanna know?
- Yeah.
Well, it was a present, but I'll find out and I'll call you.
Ah, that's great, because, uh, see, I decided to go back to my husband.
I thought it might be great for a second honeymoon.
Oh, that's great.
You're going back to Bert.
No, I'm going back to my husband.
Did you think Bert was my husband?
Oh, no, no.
No.
l - No, I didn't think Did I say "Bert"?
- You said "Bert".
Oh, well, no, I, uh Certainly, I knew.
Listen, I have to be going.
My friend is waiting for me.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all ##  - Hi, Mary.
- Hi, Milt.
How come Ted's gettin' so much mail lately?
I guess it's in response to that editorial he did last week against junk mail.
He told people they could send in for printed copies.
- You really wanna help stamp out junk mail?
- Yeah?
- Don't send out copies ofTed's editorial.
-  Yeah!
Oh, no.
Not another rejection.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Oh, poor Murray.
He's been writing this play for three years.
You'd think Broadway producers would be sensitive enough to do more than just stick - mimeographed rejection slips in when they send it back.
- What do you mean?
You know, something like a nice, handwritten note saying, "Good work, Murray.
Nice try.
Love, David Merrick".
Well, when you shoot high like Murray's doing, you gotta expect to be disappointed.
- I know.
- What do you mean, you know?
You don't think I want to stay in the mailroom all my life?
- I've got my eye on another job.
- Oh?
What job is that?
- Yours.
- Oh.
Well, why not?
No reason you couldn't be associate producer.
Yeah.
I like the title.
The work seems easy enough.
I just don't know if I can take the cut in pay.
- Hi.
- What do ya say, Milt?
- Good morning, Mr. Grant.
- Hiya.
- What?
Another one, huh?
- Yeah.
- That's bad.
- I know.
Poor Murray.
No, not poor Murray, poor Lou.
You know he's been using our postage machine to mail these?
- I sure wish he'd stop this.
- Oh, you don't mean that.
- Oh, yes, I do.
- Oh, come on, Mr. Grant.
What's wrong with Murray wanting to be a playwright?
Look Murray is a terrific newswriter.
He makes Ted Baxter sound almost intelligent.
- What's wrong with doing that for a living?
- Well, nothing - What do you want to be?
- What do you mean?
I gather you have some ambition beyond that of associate producer.
Well, just, you know, wife and mother.
But other than that, I'm perfectly happy doing what I'm doing.
Then you're the only one in the office, perhaps the whole building, maybe even the world.
Everybody wants to do something else.
Look.
This is a little, uh, something from Ted.
It's a television series idea called The Ted Baxter Show.
- What's it about?
- Beats me.
All he submitted was the title.
I guess he thought I could just take it from there.
Here's an idea for an original musical comedy from Gordy the weatherman.
Fair and Warmer.
How is it?
Predictable.
And here's the worst one of them all.
My novel.
- Mr. Grant, you wrote this?
- Mm-hmm.
It's beautifully typed.
That's what the last publisher said.
I thought I was gonna be the new Norman Mailer or something.
- What's it about?
- It's based on my experiences on IwoJima and Guadalcanal.
- Wow, that sounds exciting.
- You wanna read it?
Oh, yes, I'd really like that.
Twenty-two publishers used the word "dull".
How could your experiences on IwoJima and Guadalcanal be called "dull"?
Well, for one thing, I was there in 1958.
- Morning, Mary.
- Oh, hi, Murray.
Listen, I just, uh, made some fresh coffee over there.
Why don't you go have a cup?
Gee, you know, we never see enough of each other.
How's Marie and all?
She's, what, seven months along now?
Why don't you come over to the house for dinner, say, Thursday?
- Where is it?
- On your desk.
- Oh, boy.
- Aw, come on, Murray.
Listen.
You know how many times Noel Coward's first play was turned down - before it was finally produced?
- How many?
l-I don't know.
But I'll bet it was lots of times.
- Not this many.
-  Murray, why do you wanna do that?
It just seemed like the appropriate thing to do.
That's where it belongs.
It does not belong there.
I happen to like your play.
Then I'm glad they sent it back.
You can read it again.
I'll tell you one thing.
That is the thickest rejection letter I've ever gotten.
- Murray - Go ahead No, don't go ahead.
I know them by heart.
"Our schedule is full," or " We are not in the market for any new productions".
How about, "And we are delighted to do your play"?
Yeah, that one too.
What?
"And we're delighted to do your play.
"We plan to go into rehearsal within the next few weeks.
"Enclosed are the standard Dramatist Guild contracts for your signature.
"The Twin Cities Playhouse is proud to have a play of this caliber by a promising new local playwright as part of our 17 th season".
- Oh, Murray!
- Mary!
Wait a minute.
I don't remember submitting my play to the Twin Cities Playhouse.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- How do you suppose they got it?
-  Hi, guys.
- Hi.
- Say, Murray, I just read this item I think we should use.
It's about a man who went on television to make a plea to send turkeys to convicts.
For pets or for dinner?
I don't know.
I think it was in "Ar-kansas".
Yeah, I think they're doing the same thing in Arkansas too.
How do you like that?
It's spreading from state to state.
Speaking of turkeys, uh, Ted, last year when you acted in that production - of The Man Who Came to Dinner, what was the name of that theater group?
- Ah.
The Twin Cities Playhouse.
I'm their resident star.
I'm the only really big name they've got.
Ted, did you know they're gonna do Murray's play?
Oh, are they?
Good.
I was hoping they might.
I submitted it to them.
- Where did you get your hands on it?
- In the mailroom.
I accidentally came across it when I was going through my fan mail.
I was halfway through it before I realized it was your play.
- You read the whole script?
- Well, most of it.
I'm surprised it held your interest that long.
- It doesn't have any pictures.
- Come on, Murray.
The point is, Ted submitted it, and they're gonna do it.
That's the important thing.
It's important to me too.
You see, I'll undoubtedly play the lead.
If you'd like some tickets, Murr, I might arrange it for you.
Maybe he won't be too bad.
The star of the play that I worked on for three years can't pronounce the names of states.
- Oh.
-  -  Mary?
- Mary, you in there?
- Yeah.
Come on in, Rhoda.
Mary, I haven't seen you all week.
Where've you been?
Why don't you call me?
Do you care that I was worried sick about you?
Wait, don't answer.
I left home because of questions like that.
- Okay.
I won't answer.
- Good.
So, where have you been?
Tonight, for example?
I was, uh, at the theater.
They don't dress up much for that anymore, do they?
What'd you see?
- Well, I didn't exactly see anything.
- Bad seats?
No.
Oh, Rhoda, if I tell you, you'll make a whole big deal out of it.
I'll make a whole big deal out of it if you don't tell me.
That's true.
- Well, I'm in, uh sort of a play.
- Oh.
I didn't tell you, because I knew if I did you'd start putting it down.
- Why would I do that?
- Because you're very, uh - Competitive?
- Well, yeah.
You're wrong.
I'm very pleased you got a big part in a play.
Terrific.
So what did you have to do to get it?
What happened is that Murray wrote a play about a newsroom, and there's a part in it, a girl who works there who's single and whose name is Mary.
- Wonder why they thought of you.
-  Well, what's she like, this girl in the play?
Real cute and perky, right?
Uh, well, yeah.
Ted Baxter talked me into auditioning for the part, and I got it.
You know, it's really kind of fun.
I'm having a lot of fun with it.
You know, Mary, I've had quite a bit of theatrical experience myself.
Oh, really?
No, I didn't know that.
- Barbra Streisand and I went to high school together.
- Uh-huh.
We did.
Well, not exactly together.
She was there three years after I was.
But it was definitely the same high school.
Well, with all that, uh, theatrical background, then,  you undoubtedly know it's not all tinsel and glitter, right?
I mean, Rhoda, look, I do have to memorize this play by day after tomorrow, so Oh.
You know, Mary, it gets, uh, lonely at the top.
At least that's what Barbs always used to tell me.
Rhoda, would you do me a favor?
Please don't start treating me like I'm in show business.
I'm still working in the newsroom.
This is just something I'm doing for fun.
- Okay.
Good night, Mary.
- Good night.
So what are you gonna change your name to?
- Good morning, Mary.
- Hi, Murray.
I thought rehearsal went pretty well last night, didn't you?
Well, it's coming along, except for Ted.
You know, you're really very good.
You've got a real flair for comedy.
Oh, thanks.
I had a little stage experience in college.
- Oh?
Like what?
- I was a homecoming princess.
- That's terrific training all right.
- Yeah.
Well, who needs experience when the part is that good?
- I mean, it's so funnily written.
- Hey, thanks.
- Hey, Murray?
- Hmm?
- Do you really think I'm that dumb?
- What are you talking about?
Well, it can't be a coincidence.
The girl I play has my name, she works at my job and is pretty much of a, you know, dum-dum.
Mary, it isn't you.
Sure, the character is somewhat like you in some ways.
But I made that stuff up about her being a dum-dum for the sake of the comedy.
Look, I'm a writer.
Some of it is like you and some of it isn't.
Wh- What about the part about her being, uh, attra-attractive?
- That was based on you.
- Oh, yeah?
Thank you.
Murray.
I took the liberty of reading your script last night, and it's very good.
- Thank you, Lou.
- Very good.
However, I'm a little confused about the character who's the head of the newsroom.
Believe he's called "Lou".
Every time he speaks, he seems to be yelling or shouting.
Does somebody around here named Lou do that?
Mr. Grant, Murray is a writer.
Some of it is like you and some of it isn't.
Oh, I see.
I was certain that was it.
I was also fairly certain that in your rewrite you'd change the name of that character.
- You know, I intended to do that.
- I thought you'd might.
Thank you.
Oh, Murr.
Heh!
I'm having a little disagreement with the director.
He refuses to put up applause signs.
Uh, Ted, I don't think they have applause signs in the theater.
Then how do the people know when to laugh or applaud?
In your case, it might be a problem.
Another thing, Murr.
I think the script needs a little pinching up.
You mean "punching up," and who said it needs punching up?
My lines are a little weak.
Everybody's getting laughs but me.
Work on it, will ya, Murr?
I've gotta have it all put on cue cards pretty soon.
- If there is nothing else, I have work to do.
- About my part, the anchorman.
I'm sure it'd be easy to punch it up a little.
It's so rich with material.
Actually, it was the hardest part to write.
- Oh?
Why's that?
- Because, Ted, basically, I consider anchormen to be colorless and dull.
Many of them are.
Work on it anyway, will you, Murr?
This must be fun for you, seeing your play come alive like this.
Come on, Murray.
There are some good points about Ted being in the play.
- Name one.
- Well, like, he got it produced for you in the first place.
- Name one.
- Come on, Murray.
It's your play.
People are finally gonna see it.
- You had to say that?
The fewer people who'll see it, the better.
- Oh!
Oh, Murr, I just remembered.
I think I have a marvelous surprise for you.
- You have a case of laryngitis coming on?
- Oh, no!
I have pulled off the coup of the year.
I arranged forJohn Stymetz to come see us opening night.
That's good.
At least we'll have one person there.
Happens to be the drama critic for the Times-Herald.
Pulled a couple of strings, and he's coming to review us.
Mary, remember how rotten I felt - when I thought my play was being rejected again?
- Uh-huh.
Well, looking back on that now, I think it was a high point of my career.
Believe me, Mary, I'm not putting you on.
You were really good.
And you know how competitive I am.
I was just playing myself, Rhoda cute and perky and dumb.
Hey, you want to know how good you were?
You were so good, I was filled with hate and envy.
- You're not just saying that?
- No, I mean it.
Thanks.
Boy, oh, boy.
That Ted Baxter?
- I now have a new standard for terrible.
Oh!
- Yeah.
I can't imagine what that critic is gonna say about it.
Maybe I better tell you now.
Sort of soften the blow.
I was sitting next to him, and he kept taking notes.
He was writing down words like "bad" and "awful" and a couple I don't think they'll print.
No, Rhoda, I saw where you were sitting.
It was next to the director.
- Hey, will you give me a hand?
- Sure, whatever.
- Put this dip on the table.
- Mary, I think one is plenty.
From what I could hear, not that many people are gonna come to the party.
How'd you get stuck giving a cast party anyway?
In New York, we'd all go to Sardi's and wait for the reviews.
Hey, that's a great idea.
Let's go to New York and wait for the review.
-  - I'll get it.
- Thanks.
Hey, listen, no matter what you think, you were terrific tonight.
Coming!
Hi, Ted.
- We were just talking about you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Ted, you've met my friend, Rhoda Morgenstern, haven't you?
- Yes, we've met.
- No, I don't believe we have.
I guess I've met you, but you haven't met me.
I guess that's it.
Oh, what did you think of me tonight?
Well, uh, Ted, you were, uh, just incredible.
- Oh, ho!
You're too generous.
- Yes.
Say, Mar, I lost track.
How many curtain calls were there?
- One.
-  - That must be Murray and Marie.
-  I'll bet he's a happy man tonight.
Hi!
Author!
Author!
Where are your friends?
The ones that were with you at the theater?
- They had to go home.
- It was right after the first act.
Oh, what a darling apartment.
- I thought that the play went just great, didn't you, Mary?
- Oh Murray wrote quite a play.
I'm so proud of you, honey.
- And you were really just great, Mary.
- Well, with a part like that Oh, ho!
Uh, what did you think of me?
You were just unbelievable.
Thank you, thank you.
What did you think, Murr?
- You were everything I expected you to be.
- Thank you, thank you.
- Well, can I get a drink for anyone?
- Nothing for me, Mar.
- I'd love some milk.
- I'll have a double scotch.
- He's drinking for two.
- Oh!
The only good thing is, he or she wasn't here to see the play.
You know, I think it went awfully well tonight.
I'm sorry I forgot a few lines, but I think I ad-libbed my way out of it very neatly.
Ted, saying "excuse me" and walking off the stage to check your script is not an ad-lib!
- By the way, Mary, where's Lou?
- He stopped off at the Times-Herald to pick up the reviews.
- Oh.
Is there such a thing as a triple scotch?
- Oh Say, Mar, you're too modest.
Why didn't you come out with me for that second bow?
Because I thought we were supposed to wait until someone applauded.
I'll get your milk.
- What are you doing in here?
- Trying to think of a new word to tell Ted if he asks me again what I thought of his acting.
I've run out of noncommittal ways of saying "rotten".
Would you just get out there?
I invited you here because you're fun at a party.
I'm fun at a party where there's a lot of single men, and you do what my mother used to refer to as "mixing".
I am not fun at a party where one of the men is here with his pregnant wife, and the other one is going steady with himself.
Would you just please go out there and get the conversation started?
- But just don't bring up anything that has anything to do with acting.
- Gotcha.
Hi, all.
Did any of you know that I went to high school with Barbra Streisand?
Who?
Mary!
And then, when Barbra and I were in the tenth grade, we started harmonizing together.
That's when I told her.
"Barbs," I said, "don't get your nose fixed".
And the rest, of course, is history.
Mar, what did you think of me?
Oh, Ted playing opposite you was just -  - Thank you.
- Mr. Grant, how's the review?
- Well He loved it, right?
What'd he say?
What'd he say?
- I can't find it.
Where is it?
- Reviews aren't on the front page, Ted.
It's on page 26.
"Tragedy Strikes Twin Cities".
Wait a minute.
That's not it.
There.
- "Bomb Hits Minneapolis".
- That's it.
"There's been the atomic, there's been the hydrogen "and now, the worst bomb of them all, "a play about a newsroom called All Work and No Play.
I'll vouch for the second part.
There's no play here".
How does he like it so far?
Mary, why don't you read the rest of it so Ted can hear it?
"Not everything about the evening was a catastrophe.
"The intermission was satisfactory.
- " The main character is a TV anchorman - I want absolute quiet.
If I were you, I'd ask for noise.
"played by an actor named Ted Baxter "who obviously has no conception of what a TV anchorman is like.
Maybe it was a mistake to make him pay for his ticket.
"As you all know, I have long been an opponent of nudity on the stage.
"However, in this case, I would make an exception.
"At least it would give the audience something to look at.
He didn't even like my suit.
As for the performance of Mary Richards" Oh well Oh, ho-ho-ho, can't take a little criticism, eh?
Well, if Murray can take it and I can take it, you can take it.
Listen to this.
"A s for the performance of Mary Richards, she was the one adequate note in a dismal evening".
He liked her.
So, Marie, what are you hoping for?
A boy or girl?
Oh, yes.
- Morning, Murray.
- Hi.
What's the matter?
Nothing's the matter.
Everything's great.
I'm an ex-playwright, okay?
Or as John Stymetz so aptly put it, a"playwrong".
- It's a good play, Murray.
- John Stymetz didn't think so.
- So?
He's only one person.
- But he told half a million.
That doesn't mean they'll all believe it.
No?
My sister already canceled her tickets for tonight.
Murray, I can't believe that you're going to let one man's opinion really get to you like this.
I mean, you have to trust yourself.
You must know your play is good, even if the production was lousy.
A writer has to know these things.
Like, I wrote a book, and I don't care what anyone says.
I know my book is rotten.
Lou, I don't want to discuss last night anymore.
I'm a lucky guy.
I enjoy this crummy job.
- What's so bad about being a no-talent failure?
- Ohh!
Good morning, everybody.
See how beautiful being called "adequate" is?
Murray, if what I have here doesn't make you feel better, then nothing will.
I don't think Norman Vincent Peale's gonna do it for me today, thanks.
These are books of play reviews, including some ofJohn Stymetz's more memorable criticisms when he was reviewing plays in New York.
-  Mary, what are you doing?
- Would you just listen, please?
"In my time, I have been to some funerals and even a couple of wakes, "but last night was a first for me.
"I watched an actual death, a happy little number that should take a hint and expire quickly, Death of a Salesman.
" - You're kidding.
- No.
It's right there.
Listen to this little beauty.
"If you love George Bernard Shaw coupled with great music, "I suggest you put Mozart on your phonograph and read Pygmalion.
"But don't go to see an abomination called - My Fair Lady.
" - My Fair Lady.
Lou, he hated My Fair Lady!
He hates everything!
Wait till I read you what he said about Richard Burton's Hamlet.
- He didn't like Burton?
- He didn't like the play!
John Stymetz hasn't liked one major Broadway hit in the ten years he's been reviewing plays.
- He hates everything.
- What did I tell you, Murray?
But I wanted to be the first thing he liked.
Murray, the point is, he has been wrong every time.
I wonder Does that mean that I wasn't even adequate?
Hi, guys.
Hey, listen to this.
"Last night a new star was born in Minneapolis.
"His name is Ted Baxter, and the Twin Cities has rarely witnessed such a virtuoso performance".
- Ted, that's fantastic.
- I know.
Now if I can only get someone to print it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all I just never saw Mr. Grant so happy.
When he walked down the aisle with his daughter on his arm, he was positively glowing.
Because he and I spent a few hours before the wedding working on that glow.
Oh.
Gee, I don't know what it is about weddings, but everybody is so happy and filled with love.
- Even the weather was lovely.
- It had to be.
I predicted rain.
- Hey, Lou!
- Hey.
- Congratulations.
- What a terrific wedding.
It was.
We were just talking about it.
- Coffee?
- Oh, I'd love it.
Thank you.
It was a terrific wedding, wasn't it?
Even the kids had a really good time.
- Too bad they had to leave so early.
- I didn't see them leave.
Yeah, remember after the ceremony when they walked back up the aisle?
They just kept right on going, right in their car.
We got outside just in time to throw rice at their skid marks.
Who needs a bride and groom for a great wedding, huh?
And it was a great wedding.
Yeah.
You know, that woman, my wife, raised three daughters from scratch.
Three daughters, three weddings.
Now they're all out on their own.
Their lives are ahead of them, and ours Suddenly our house is so quiet.
- Must be an awful feeling.
- No, it's a great feeling!
For the first time in our lives, we can be alone together.
Come on.
You must have been alone together when you were first married.
No.
We moved in with her folks.
We didn't move out until our first daughter was born.
Then our second daughter was born.
Then our third daughter was born.
It seems like most of our marriage we spent with a kid in wet pajamas in bed between us.
I don't know how we ever had the third kid.
Hey, wait till you see what I got here.
Guess what this is.
It looks like one of those artificial logs.
- It's one of those artificial logs.
- That was my next guess.
Tonight I'm gonna go home early, I'm gonna put the chain on the lock, - soft music on the FM, -  Hmm.
- and light my log.
- All right.
The wife and I will have a few drinks, you know, kind of relax, and then Well, i-if you guys want to, uh, talk, I've got some work.
No, no, no, no.
That's all I was planning to tell anyway.
Don't you guys have some work to do?
- Oh, uh, Mr. Grant.
- Huh?
Listen, now that the, uh, wedding is over, - and you and Mrs. Grant are free - What is it, Mary?
I was just wondering if you and Mrs. Grant would like to come to my house for dinner one night this week.
- This week, huh?
- Well, yeah.
Just a nice, quiet evening with the boss for dinner and all.
- This week, huh?
- Yeah, is this week bad for you?
Well, yeah, as a matter of fact, it is.
I plan to be burning a lot of logs this week.
Oh.
Oh, well, then, uh, next week.
Better.
Much better.
The fire oughta be dying down by then.
- Hey, everybody!
- Hiya, Gordy.
- Hey, everybody!
- Hiya, Gordy.
Great day, isn't it?
If you call a driving rainstorm with occasional hail a great day.
You don't understand.
When a weatherman predicts showers and gets a rainstorm like this, it's like  hittin' a home run with the bases loaded.
- Hi, Lou.
- Hi, Lou.
Good morning, Mr. Grant.
Five mornings in a row.
Maybe he's having trouble lighting his log.
- Yes, Mr. Grant.
- Mary, come in here!
Yes, I'll be right there, sir.
Good luck.
- Yes, sir?
- Who messed up my desk?
Well, I straightened it up for you.
I don't like it straightened up.
I like it unstraightened up.
I sorted all your papers and put them in your drawer.
They're at your fingertips.
No, the top of my empty desk is at my fingertips.
What I'm trying to say is, my desk is my castle.
For years, when people saw my messy desk, they knew I was working.
Now they come in, they see a clean desk, they know you're working.
I want 'em to know I'm working.
- Do I make myself clear?
- Uh, you'd like your mess back?
Very much.
I think this pile was here.
This was here.
There.
There.
There.
- Anything else?
- No, that's about it for now.
Oh, Mr. Grant, uh, about a week ago, I asked if you and Mrs. Grant would like to come to my house for dinner.
Well, it's, uh, been about a week.
I was wondering if you'd like to come over, uh, tomorrow night.
No, I don't think so.
- Oh.
- Well, you see, uh, tomorrow night's not too good.
I'm, uh I mean, uh Oh, listen, no, I understand.
That's No Uh, you and Mrs. Grant have made plans to go out or maybe you're just staying home.
In any case, you've made some sort of plans to maybe do nothing at all, right?
Yeah, it's in there somewhere.
Well, uh, some-some other time then.
Uh-huh.
Rhoda called.
She wants you to pick her up after work.
Sure, everybody always wants you to pick 'em up after work.
- Huh?
- I'm sorry, Murray.
I'm a little upset.
Yeah, coming out of that door seems to do that to people.
Murray, when you and your wife came to my house for dinner, you had a good time, didn't you?
We had a great time.
You're a terrific cook.
Oh, I'm a terrific cook!
Now, look, Mary, the reason Marie and I haven't invited you for dinner - Oh, Murray, no, I wasn't - No, Mary, we want to.
Murray, no.
I don't want to come to your house for dinner!
- Oh.
- What I'm trying to say is Murr, if you're having trouble getting people to come to your house for dinner, I'd love to.
- When is it?
- Murray, look.
I don't know how the subject got around to your house for dinner, but what I was talking about was the Grants refusing to come to my house for dinner.
- Then it's at your place?
- Ted, there is no dinner.
It's been canceled.
That's too bad.
I was looking forward to it.
Maybe Mr. Grant just doesn't believe in socializing with the people he works with.
I don't think that's it.
When Marie and I had the Grants for dinner You had them, uh, for dinner?
- Well, only three or four times.
- Th-Three But you're right, Mary.
They didn't enjoy it.
Well, they certainly enjoyed it at my place.
- Y-You had them too?
- Oh, yes.
And I really put out a great gourmet spread.
Boy, did they eat it up.
You know, there wasn't one piece of chicken left in that bucket.
It seems that everybody here has had the Grants for dinner, except me.
Now, look, Mary.
Lou is the kind of guy that goes to a lot of banquets and dinners.
He was probably busy for the night you asked him for.
- Think so?
- Sure.
Why don't you pick another night when he's free?
-  - I will.
- Uh, Mr. Grant?
- Mm-hmm?
Are you busy Thursday night?
Thursday night?
No, I don't think so.
- Oh, good.
- Why?
Because I want to have you and Mrs. Grant to my house for dinner.
Ohh.
Ohh, uh Oh, uh, I just remembered, Mary.
I'm sorry, but we are kind of busy on Thursday night.
Well, that's No, that's okay, 'cause I just, uh, remembered that I'm, um, kind of busy on Thursday night too.
I just wish I knew why Mr. Grant keeps turning me down.
I know what you mean.
It's been years, and I still don't know why they turned me down for that stewardess job.
Oh, come on, Rhoda.
Lots of girls don't make it as stewardesses.
For a bus company?
Maybe your boss just doesn't like you.
Oh, thanks.
I really needed that.
Could be his wife, Mar.
Maybe she can't stand you.
I've gotta find out.
- I'm gonna call her.
- Good.
Hey, if they accept, tell them to bring their own pizza.
Hello, uh, Mrs. Grant.
It's, uh, Mary Richards.
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.
Mrs. Grant, I'm just calling to find out if you and Mr. Grant would like to come over and have dinner with me one night this week or next week.
Whenever.
You say.
You're kidding.
Well, Mrs. Grant, l-I'm, uh, awfully sorry that I bothered you.
Good-bye.
Oh, Mary, kid.
Listen, when I said she hated you She doesn't hate me, Rhoda.
It's worse.
She and Mr. Grant have separated.
So this old Italian fisherman was walking down the road.
This-This is really a great story.
It's just funny.
And this car goes by, and this little boy sticks his head out the window and he says, "Hey, old fisherman"!
The old fisherman says, " Hey, that's-a no way to talk-a to a fisherman, huh"?
And then the boy says the boy says Oh, wait.
The father of the boy says Hey, what did he say?
- Ted!
- Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.
This is gonna be one of those big jokes.
I can tell.
-  Hi, Mary.
- Wait a minute!
I know the punch line.
I just have to get all that stuff up front.
- Mr. Grant in?
- Not yet.
I guess I'll just ask Chuckles the Clown.
Gee, he got such a big laugh this morning when he told it on his show.
Chuckles gets laughs no matter what joke he tells.
When he gets to the punch line, his nose lights up and his pants fall down.
- Mary, what's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.
I'm just a little depressed, that's all.
It's nothing.
- Hi, Lou.
- Good morning, Murray.
Mary, would you please get Mrs. Grant on the phone for me?
Oh, yes, sir!
I'd be delighted to get Mrs. Grant on the phone for you.
I'll have to remember that the next time I get depressed.
Just get Mrs. Grant on the phone.
Hello, Mrs. Grant.
Good morning.
Hi.
Mr. Grant's calling.
One moment, please.
Mr. Grant, good morning.
Hi.
Mrs. Grant on two.
Gonna keep it to yourself or tell your fellow worker?
Well, I just feel great.
And I feel great just seeing you feel great.
What's so great?
Well, Mr. Grant is calling Mrs. Grant, and His light just went out.
Come in.
- Mr. Grant?
- Mm-hmm?
- I need your signature on these.
- What are you so happy about?
Mr. Grant, look, I know I'm not supposed to know, but now that you and Mrs. Grant are back together again, I know, and I am very, very happy.
- You're also very, very wrong.
- Wrong?
Very, very.
I just assumed that when you called Mrs. Grant Mary, the reason I called Mrs. Grant was because I had all these dirty shirts.
I asked her if she'd still do them for me.
She said she'd just as soon not.
Mr. Grant, I'm very sorry that you're separated.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I look at a separation like I look at two boxers going to their corners between rounds.
That doesn't mean the fight is over, Mary.
Just means they're resting.
I know, but last week when you went home to your wife with your log, you just seemed so - Look, this is none of my business.
- No, no, no, please sit.
I'm glad you brought this up.
You see, you're about the only person whose opinion I value around here.
Thank you, Mr. Grant.
I do try to Because I know you won't do anything stupid like try to give me advice or comment in any way whatsoever.
Oh.
When I went home early last week, I was really looking forward to being alone with my wife.
When I got there, I was alone, all right.
- No wife.
- Where was she?
Enrolling at the University of Minnesota.
My wife's a coed.
Well, Mr. Grant, she was probably looking for a way to fill her days.
Mary, what I think you just said is a comment.
Right.
Sorry.
It's just that it's very hard not to comment when you care.
Do you know what it's like to come home and find a 43-year-old woman doing homework?
She doesn't study all the time.
No, the rest of the time she sleeps.
You get very tired when you're doing homework, you know?
Finally it got so bad, I had to lay down the law.
I said, " Edie, if you don't quit school right now, I am walking".
Just to give it more emphasis, I started walking toward the door.
I figured she'd call my name, and that would be it.
But I didn't hear my name.
So I started walking slower and slower.
The next thing I knew, I was in St. Paul.
Uh, where are you staying?
A hotel.
How's Mrs. Grant doing?
Oh, B's and C's.
I meant how is she doing living alone?
She doesn't seem to mind it.
Her schoolwork, uh, takes up most of her time.
I'd heard about this change-of-life thing, but I never thought it would be mine.
Well, Mr. Grant, I know you've heard this too, but, well, if there's anything I can do Oh.
Thanks, Mary.
Ah!
Listen, don't worry.
She'll be calling me pretty soon.
I'll win.
That's-a no way to talk to a fisherman, huh?
Then the father of the boy says I wrote it down so I'd get it right.
The father of the boy says, " Yeah, but that's a great way to talk to a" Can you make that last word out?
- Looks like, um, "muflaff".
- "Muflaff".
I see nothing happened while I was gone.
It still isn't happening.
Ted's been trying to tell the same joke for the past 20 minutes.
- Good.
I could use a laugh right now.
- You better not listen to him.
What did Lou get you for this time?
Oh, Murray, I wish I could tell you, but it's kind of a personal matter and I can't tell you.
About Lou and his wife breaking up?
- When did you find out?
- Lou called me the night it happened.
Talking about the Grants?
Too bad.
Say, can you make this word out, Murray?
- Ted, you knew too?
- Well, sure.
- We all know.
- I guess you're the last to find out.
But don't feel bad, Mary.
It's something guys tell guys.
It's not the kind of thing a woman can help you with.
Uh Mary.
Yes, Mr. Grant.
It just occurred to me that I could use a little female advice.
You're a woman.
I'd really like to hear what you have to say about all this.
Well, I'd be glad to, Mr. Grant.
- Yes, glad to.
- Well, what about tonight?
We could go downstairs and have a cocktail.
That would be great.
Fine.
Yes, I'd like that very much.
Hey, if any of you other guys wanna join us for a few blasts tonight, you're all welcome.
Bourbon and Seven.
- Scotch rocks.
- Mm-hmm.
Scotch water.
CrÃ¨me de menthe frappÃ© for the lady.
Oh, no, that's for him.
So that's why your tongue is always green.
Here, I got it.
Happy hour is over in four minutes.
- Shall I order your next round now?
- Yeah.
I'll care of it.
- No, I got it.
- Look, Gordy, I'll take care of it.
- I got it.
- I have some extra money.
Hold it, hold it, hold it!
I have a simple solution to the problem.
Murray said it first, so he pays.
- Gordy gets the third round.
- Who's got the round after Gordy?
- I guess that's you, Mar.
-  Ted!
I'm just kidding.
Can't you tell I'm kidding?
Well, here we are.
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
Sure is good to be out drinking with the boys.
It's healthy to get away from our wives once in a while.
- I'll drink to that.
-  Amen.
Say, Gordy, what did the Twins do last night?
Oh, it was too much.
They were falling all over themselves.
Gordy, I didn't know you had twins!
No, Mary.
He's talking about the Minnesota Twins.
- You know, baseball?
Round, white ball?
- Yes, I know, Mr. Grant.
- I just thought - No, don't apologize.
You're just being a typical woman.
You give a woman a big, thick newspaper, she always picks out the sports page to put under the dog food dish.
My old lady does the same kind of thing.
Soon as she hears the kickoff on television, that's when she turns on the vacuum cleaner.
- That's another one.
- My old lady used to do the same thing.
That's why I moved out.
What are you talking about?
You've never been married.
Well, it's just as hard living with a mother as it is with a wife.
Oh, a real old lady.
Imagine my wife wanting to improve herself by going back to school.
And at her age.
She doesn't want to be a housewife anymore, so what's she taking in college?
Home economics.
She's going for her master's, then a PhD.
Mr. Grant, that's terrific.
What's the matter with that?
For one thing, I don't want us to be introduced as Mr. and Dr. Grant.
- Oh!
- Women, they don't know what they want.
Are you sure you know what you want, Mr. Grant?
I know exactly what I want.
Here's the second round.
- Thanks, Murr.
- Oh, it's, uh, my pleasure, Ted.
Why don't you try it sometimes, see what it's like?
I'd like to propose a toast.
To men's lib.
- Let's hang on to what little we've got.
- I'll drink to that.
Hold it!
I, uh, can't drink to that.
Mr. Grant, you invited me so that you could hear a woman's point of view.
And I've appreciated it.
But I haven't said anything.
I have been sitting here like some kind of idiot, acting like I agree with everything you've said.
We respect you for that, Mar.
That's right.
You're some kind of woman.
But I don't agree with everything you've said.
- Uh-oh.
- As a matter of fact, I don't agree with anything you've said.
That's because you're a woman and you're on their side.
Sides?
Oh, Mr. Grant, that is just dumb.
And that was an unfortunate choice of words.
I mean, you're sitting here, your wife is sitting at home, and you're both miserable.
You're not winning anything, Mr. Grant.
You're both losing.
- What's she getting so excited about?
- Well, he asked me.
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did, earlier back at the office.
Oh, yeah.
Look, I'm sorry if I put a damper on things, but you'd rather have me be honest, wouldn't you?
No, I don't think so.
Listen, uh, I've got a date.
I really have to be going.
- Please, don't anybody get up.
- How are you gonna get out?
You're right.
Everybody up, please.
Thank you very much, and I'll see you all at the office tomorrow.
- Can I have your drink, Mar?
- Yeah, sure, Ted.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Stick to your guns, Lou.
Once you let a woman push you around, you're sunk.
- What time you got, Gordy?
- Quarter to 8:00.
Ooh, I better get going.
I told Marie I had a news conference until 7:30.
Now I have to think of some new kind of excuse.
Wait a minute.
I'll walk out with you.
I want to say good night to my kids.
- See you tomorrow.
- See you in the morning!
I suppose you have to get somewhere too?
Oh, no, Lou.
We can stay out as late as you want.
Hey, Lou, I got a great idea.
There's this new club we could go to across town.
I understand it's a pretty "risky" show.
No, l I don't think so, Ted.
Hey, Ted?
Have you got a dime?
Why?
Is it my turn to leave a tip?
- No, I gotta make a phone call.
- Oh, sure, Lou.
Thanks.
Edie?
Lou.
How you doin'?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Me Me too.
Uh listen, Edie, uh, if you're if you're not doing anything tonight, I'm comin' home.
Yeah.
Yeah, l I know what you mean, baby.
Me too.
Yeah, all right.
What?
Oh.
Okay.
Quart of milk.
Pound of butter.
Bacon.
American cheese.
And an artificial log.
All right, bye-bye.
-  - Newsroom.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Grant.
Yes, he is.
Just a moment, please.
Uh, Mr. Grant, Mrs. Grant on two.
I know why she's calling.
Remember inviting Mrs. Grant and me for dinner?
Of course I do.
When would you like to come?
Tuesday, Wednesday, you name it.
- We can't make it.
- Oh.
But she would like you to come to our place for dinner tonight.
Tonight?
Well, thank you.
Yes, I'd like to do that.
We're having chilled vichyssoise, veal scallopini, noodles almondine and baked Alaska.
Sounds terrific!
Leftovers from her home economics test.
Well, that's okay.
Listen, I love leftovers.
She got a C-minus.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all Say, did you meet the new receptionist?
She's such a warm girl.
I'll say she's warm.
I introduced myself, and she hugged me.
The entire time we talked, she kept touching me, as though she couldn't believe I was real.
We all have that problem with you, Ted.
I just got hugged out there!
- It's happening to a lot of people.
- Hi!
- Did she get you too, Mary?
- Did who get me?
They got a new receptionist downstairs.
Didn't you see her on the way up?
No.
There was a crowd in the lobby area, though, around the reception desk.
- What's she like?
- Mary Richards!
She's very friendly.
- Hi there.
- Hi!
Don't you know me?
Well, yes, of course I know you.
You're the new receptionist.
Think back, Mar.
Didn't you go to camp when you were a little kid?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
I went to Camp Sunshine for five years.
- And that's where I know you from!
- No.
Oh.
Camp Owmwuk.
Didn't you go to Camp Owmwuk in 1950?
I did!
I went to Camp Owmwuk one year.
That's where I know you - No, no.
- That's it!
Yes!
Camp Owmwuk.
It's me Twinks.
Twinks!
- Well, well!
- Well.
You haven't changed a bit.
How are you?
Oh, I'm just fine, Mar.
- Oh, well.
- How are you?
Just fine!
Twinks and I were friends in camp.
Yes.
Best friends.
And we haven't seen each other in, what 18 years.
Not since we were 12.
That makes them 30, Ted.
Wow!
After 18 years, uh, what do you say?
What's new?
Well, they moved the camp to the other side of the lake after it burned down.
- Oh.
- And my father retired.
And, um, I got a new car, and I'm getting married.
Hey, that's terrific!
No kidding!
Well, yeah, the old car needed four new tires, so I meant getting married.
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's why I moved to Minneapolis to be closer to my fiance.
Oh, Mar, isn't it somethin'?
- Us working at the same place.
- It really is!
Oh, Mar, tell me what's new with you.
Well, I moved here, what - Mary, don't you have some work to do?
- Yes.
Yes, sir.
Sorry.
- I really have to get to work.
- Yeah, me too.
- How 'bout dinner tonight?
- Fine.
Oh, I have so much to tell you about the kids at camp.
You, uh, still keep up with some of'em, do you?
All of'em.
I still put out the camp alumni bulletin.
Mary, haven't you been getting yours?
Uh, well, no, not for some time now.
Oh, well, I'll get you all the back copies.
- Okay.
- I'll see you later, Mar.
- Right.
- Murray.
Ted!
She was always such a warm, friendly person.
She always used to make up people's bunks for them at camp.
I don't trust warm and friendly people.
Now, if you're through with old home week, - shall we get on with the mail?
- Yes.
Sorry about all the hysteria out there, but it is fun catching up with old friends.
- Yeah, I did that a couple of weeks ago.
- Oh, who'd you see?
The Second Marine Division.
My old outfit.
- We had a reunion.
- It must have been fun.
Fun?
They booked this big room in a hotel.
The first thing they did was pin this tag on my coat that said, " Sergeant Grant.
Remember me"?
- So, what's wrong with that?
- What's wrong with that?
There I was, surrounded by and suddenly I didn't have rank on them anymore.
It's amazing how they remembered all the little slights that I committed in boot camp Hey, 'bout 20 years ago, you and I were both in camp.
I'm sorry.
Of course, some of the reunions I've been to haven't been so bad.
Right there in that same hotel, I went to a Notre Dame reunion.
- It was terrific.
- I didn't know you went to Notre Dame.
I didn't, but those guys really know how to throw a bash.
Word to the wise, Mary The best kind of reunion is one where you don't know anybody.
- I'll, uh, keep that in mind.
- Yeah.
- Remember cute, little Archie, Mary?
- Uh-huh.
I'm so glad I brought the camp scrapbook.
It's nice to point out the people as I tell you about them.
Gee, Twinks, all we've talked about all night long is camp.
I'd love to hear about your life now, you know, or even college.
Anything as recent as high school, even.
Okay, sure.
I understand, Mar.
Hey, look what you wrote here.
"2 good 2 be You wrote it with the numbers.
Wasn't that clever of me?
- Oh, you always were such a kick.
-  - Excuse me.
- Mary, you haven't changed a bit.
Your apartment is still as neat as your tent used to be.
Thank you.
Hi, kid.
I got the brochures from the travel agency.
They have this trip to Hawaii that looks - Hi.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you had company.
Oh, I'm not company.
I'm Twinks.
Twinks?
Rhoda Morgenstern, Twinks McFarland.
- Twinks.
- We know each other from Owmwuk.
Owmwuk.
You know, Camp Owmwuk.
Twinks just got a job at the station.
She's the new receptionist.
Receptionist.
Ah, at last a word I know.
You two must have a great deal to talk over, so I'll come back tomorrow.
No, don't go!
I mean stay.
Okay.
Yes, stay.
I'd love to look at your brochures.
Rhoda and I are just trying to figure out where we might spend our vacation.
Hawaii!
Oh, how fun.
When?
Maybe I can get some time off and go too.
Well, actually, um, Twinks, we're not sure that I can even get the time off.
You know how busy things are at the station.
Yes.
Well, then maybe Rhoda and I can go alone.
Rhoda, would you believe that it's been, uh, oh, 18 years since Twinks and I saw each other?
Marvelous.
- You're not from here, are you, Rhoda?
- What do you mean?
Well, I can just tell by the way you talk.
You're right.
I'm from England.
Oh!
Don't you just love Minneapolis?
I just love everyone I've met here!
Listen, uh, I gotta go.
Nice meetin' you Twinks.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Oh, I gotta run too.
I'm running late, as usual.
My fiance will kill me.
He says since I've been here, I've spent so much time with all my new friends that I hardly see him at all.
- I'll get your coat.
- I'll help you.
Oh, Mary, it was so much fun tonight.
How 'bout lunch tomorrow?
Uh, well, tomorrow I, uh, I know that I'm doing something.
I just, uh, can't think what it is.
- Has that ever happened to you, Rhoda?
- No, never.
Well, that's okay.
I'll pencil you in for Thursday then.
Then we can make plans for the weekend later.
- Oh, Rhoda.
- l-I'm on a big diet.
I don't eat all week.
And I fast on weekends.
Oh, that's all right.
We can find something nonfattening to do, like window shopping.
I know we'll have lots in common.
- Bye, Mar.
- Bye, Twinks.
- Bye, Rhoda.
- Bye.
- Twinks, huh?
-  - Uh-huh!
- What?
I just figured out what Twinks must be short for"Tiddledywinks".
What a night.
You just can't imagine.
- I had to be there, huh?
- And unfortunately, I was.
Well, you met her, and you know what old camp stories are like.
- How would I know about camp?
- You must have gone to camp.
No.
Actually, I did go one summer to a day camp in the Bronx.
Camp Adelman.
- Camp Adelman?
- Yeah.
I was 12 years old before I knew Adelman wasn't an Indian name.
It was from 1:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon.
You got there and you made some ceramic monstrosity in arts and crafts.
Then you drank warm orange drink from a carton.
Then you went home.
You don't know what a deprived childhood is until you've sung campfire songs on the subway.
"2 good 2 be 4" I was 12 years old.
I guess we talked about camp enough for one night.
That's all right.
We didn't just talk about camp.
You think that's all we talked about?
- We talked about other things.
- Yeah?
- We talked about her fiance.
- Oh, what's he do?
- He's a counselor.
- Marriage?
Camp.
I'd tell you to stop reading over my shoulder, but you need all the practice you can get.
- Hi.
- You're late, Mar.
I know.
I had to walk up ten flights of stairs.
- Is the elevator out of order?
- No, but it stops at the reception area, if you know what I mean.
Twinks is getting to you too, huh?
There are some people who don't see each other for years, and it doesn't matter.
They can just pick right up where they left off and be great friends.
- Yeah.
- Twinks isn't one of them.
Last week we finally ran out of camp talk.
Yes, finally.
And we had nothing left to say to each other.
Maybe she'll get tired of this place and look for a new job.
Yeah, and I know the perfect one for her greeting planes in Hawaii.
That friend of yours I'm gonna give her about one more chance.
About what?
To stop hugging me.
Rudeness doesn't work.
Nastiness doesn't work.
She just keeps right on coming.
She refuses to take a hint.
- Tell her to leave you alone.
- That was my hint!
Mary, why do you keep doing this to me?
Oh, this thing is just getting bigger and bigger.
I'm gonna have to ease out of the friendship thing with her.
How are you gonna do that?
I'll just go out there and tell her that I'm gonna be very busy for the next few weeks, that I will call her when I'm free.
It's as simple as that.
Maybe I'll do it by phone.
Can't face her, huh, Mar?
Murr, I'd like to test this item on our show tonight.
See what you think of it.
Uh, Twinks?
Hi.
Mary.
Listen, uh, Twinks, I Oh, really?
How wonderful.
Well, sure, I'd love to.
The, uh, the 12th.
Yes, I'll make a note of it.
The 12th.
Right.
Bye, Twinks.
- Come on.
- Hmm?
You said the 12th.
What's the 12th?
The 12th is a date in the calendar.
Well, even Ted knows that.
Come on.
What's happening on the 12th?
Twinks is getting married on the 12th.
I don't understand.
What's wrong?
That's good news.
My wife says married girls don't like to go around with single girls.
You should be thrilled!
There's still the matter of the wedding.
But it's only a wedding.
That's not such a big deal.
Yes, it is a big deal when you're going to be the maid of honor!
Anyway, her best friend from California can't come out to be in the wedding, so what could I say?
- I didn't have the heart to say no.
- You mean the nerve.
Don't you know what standing up for a wedding means?
It's not just walking down the aisle.
I know.
I stood up for 11 weddings in college.
As maid of honor, you have to go running here and there, choosing things, arranging this well, you know.
Right.
Well, when you're younger, it doesn't matter.
You get all caught up in the hysteria of the wedding.
But now it's different.
I just don't want to do it.
I don't blame you.
Listen, when you're single in college, it doesn't matter.
You don't care if another girl gets married.
Now I can't stand to see another girl walk down the aisle in a movie theater.
You know the worst part?
I feel like a hypocrite.
I just don't feel close enough to Twinks to be her maid of honor.
Hey, Mary, call her and tell her something came up.
You're right.
Enough is enough.
I will call her and tell her that I'm going out of town, and that's honest.
- How is that honest?
- I'll go.
You're the only person I know who'd take a trip rather than lie.
Hello, uh, Twinks?
Uh, Mary.
Listen, Twinks.
Rhoda and I are Purple?
Well, no, Twinks, purple has never really been one of my favorite colors.
I Pink.
Okay.
Yes, pink is is fine.
Oh, never mind.
It was It was nothing important.
- Rhoda?
Yeah, she's here.
- What?
- Just a second.
Twinks for you.
- Uh-uh.
- Wh- What do you mean, "uh-uh"?
- I'm not gonna talk to her.
Rhoda, she knows you're here.
You can't do this to me!
Okay.
Okay, I'll talk to her for you.
Yeah?
Isn't that too bad?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
See you around.
- That was short.
- You bet it was short.
Okay, so I don't handle people as well as you do.
Maybe I'm a hypocrite.
I don't know.
Before you say another word, shake hands with the bridesmaid who's wearing purple.
Hi, Tommy.
How's the social event of the season coming along?
Well, the rehearsal dinner is tonight, then it'll be all over tomorrow.
I'm just gonna make it.
I'm overdrawn at the bank for the first time in my life.
- I don't believe it.
- What?
A mimeographed wedding invitation.
Aren't they usually engraved?
- Can someone tell me what this is about?
- What is this?
"Mr. and Mrs. Simon McFarland "request the honor of your presence at the marriage of their daughter Rochelle Margaret to Mr. Arnold Tvedt".
There he goes again.
Can't you read anything without mispronouncing it?
- How would you pronounce that then?
- "Tvedt".
T-V-E-D-T.
Oh, must be a typo.
What is a "tvedt"?
It's a name.
Arnold Tvedt.
Oh.
- And who is Rochelle Margaret McFarland?
- Twinks.
I should have known.
Poor Twinks.
I just realized.
What?
Well, it's just something girls do when they're going with a guy.
They doodle her name and his together, you know, to just see how it's gonna look together.
What a shock it must have been the first time she wrote it down and saw it.
Twinks Tvedt.
Hey, say, Murray, is it all right if I ride with you to the wedding?
- I won't get as wrinkled that way.
- Oh, Ted, you're going?
- Sure.
- Ted'll go anywhere he can wear his tux.
- How 'bout you?
Are you going, Murray?
- Well, I don't know.
I guess we all have to go.
We see her every day.
She does lots of favors.
Well, Mr. Grant, are you, uh, go I No.
Hi, all.
Mary, here are the dresses for you and Rhoda.
I was so worried they wouldn't get here on time.
I sent to Detroit for them.
Oh, I see you all got your wedding invitations.
I'll put the R.S.V.P.
list on the bulletin board and pick it up later.
Oh, Mr. Grant, are you coming?
My father can't be here.
He's overseas.
You remind me so much of him.
I'm not gonna have to give you away or anything, am I?
Oh, no, I just want you to be there.
Yeah, all right.
All right.
Oh, I'm gonna miss you all so much.
Yeah, same here.
Ohh!
Oh, what a beautiful thing to say.
I guess it's the way I put things.
Oh, Mary, I still can't get over that rehearsal.
Oh, Mary, I still can't get over that rehearsal.
I can't hear you, Rhoda.
The stuff packed around the dress is making too much noise.
I said, that rehearsal If that's any indication of what the wedding's gonna be, we're in for a lot of laughs.
What'd you think of Arnold?
You know, it's funny how some people look like their names.
Like I once knew this guy named Fox.
This guy named Fox had red, bushy hair and little, beady eyes.
Now, Arnold, he looks just like a tvedt.
Hey, what's taking you so long, kid?
I want to see the dress.
Mary?
Are you having trouble in there?
- Mary!
-  Yeah?
Oh, it's bad, huh?
Well, come out, kid.
How bad could it be?
That bad, huh?
I'd say, uh, 'bout the only thing worse than this dress would be this dress  in purple.
Are you all right?
Who would have thought that the stuff I said was packed around the dress was the dress?
But wait, it gets better.
As maid of honor, I get the special added attraction of this sash.
Well, now, no wonder.
That makes it.
Now all you need is a lamb.
You can go as Little Bo Peep.
I can't get over Rhoda, to think that we are going to be seen - Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
To be seen in public!
Well, listen, if we get rid of the hoops, it might help.
- Get rid of the hoops?
- Right.
And for a cute touch, we could get sticks and roll them alongside of us.
If we got rid of the hoops and, uh, and the bows Right.
We take off the bows, those puffy sleeves, the skirt We'll be walking down the aisle in our underwear, Mary.
This is gonna be a challenge it really is to see if we can turn these dresses into something halfway decent.
I'm beginning to look forward to the wedding.
You've gotta be kidding.
No, I mean it.
I know I didn't want to do it at first, but now that I'm involved in it, all caught up in the fun of the wedding and all -  -  Who's this?
- Hi!
Twinks!
- Hi.
Oh, you've got it on.
I was hoping to get here before you opened the box.
I wish you had.
- Twinks, what is it?
Tell me.
- I can't.
- Did you and Arnold have a fight?
- Oh, no.
-  - Oh, that Arnold, he's so impatient.
He can't stand it when I'm away from him for one second.
Isn't that cute?
- Will you tell me what's wrong?
- Mary.
My best, best best, very best friend is flying out after all, and I You want her to be the maid of honor?
That's it!
Oh, you're not mad?
I knew you'd understand.
-  - Oh, that's Arnold.
I better tell him to wait while you take off the dress.
Take off th-the dress?
Yes, so Patsy can wear it.
Well, I ju I just I just paid for it.
Oh, Mar, I couldn't get another dress from Detroit by tomorrow.
I'm sure you and she can work something out money wise.
Oh, isn't it lucky that you're both the same size?
-  - Oh!
That must be the prerequisite for being her best friend you gotta be a size eight.
Mary, that is why I stay away from warm, friendly people.
- They get you every time.
- She did get me a little, didn't she?
A little?
Mary, you've been running yourself ragged for her, planning her wedding, giving her a shower, buying gifts, just because you shared a bunk 18 years ago.
Then she comes in here and does this?
Ahh.
It's ridiculous.
Frankly, it's not my idea of a friendship.
- You're just gonna take it, aren't you?
- Maybe I won't.
Ah, yes, you will.
You always do.
Well, just maybe this time I won't, that's all.
- Oh, thanks, Mar.
-  Oh, Arnold!
We were thinking it would look better without the hoops.
- Listen Twinks.
- Hmm?
You know, I've been sort of running myself ragged for you the last couple of weeks, giving showers and gifts and everything because I thought you were my friend, and now you come in here and tell me some other girl is just gonna walk down the aisle in my dress.
You know, that somehow bothers me.
Frankly, that's just not my idea of friendship.
You're right, Mary.
It might look better without the hoops.
I'll see you at the wedding.
Bye!
You're right.
I'm glad I got that out of my system.
I am.
Well, I was pretty proud of you.
However, it might have been more effective had she heard you!
Why?
It wouldn't have made any difference at all.
There is no getting through to that girl.
She doesn't listen.
- It's like talking to a wall.
- What are you getting so excited about?
It's all over, and frankly, I don't really mind.
But I do!
I'm still a bridesmaid!
Well, I gotta admit, I found one great moment of satisfaction during that ceremony.
Really?
What was that?
When I saw that beautiful girl, that friend from California, walking down the aisle in that dress, looking absolutely hide Actually, she didn't, you know, look that bad.
Good try, Mar.
How 'bout the viciousness when Twinks threw the bouquet?
Boy, you had to be a real fighter to get that one.
Those girls were more desperate than I was, but not as tricky.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all Thanks again for the ride, Chuck.
- It was really nice meeting you.
- We have to do it again sometime.
Yes, I'd like that.
Well, uh, I'll see you again.
Bye-bye.
- Well -  Is it too soon to be "again"?
No, of course not.
Come on in.
- We don't mind.
- If your wife doesn't.
What makes you think I'm married?
- Anybody who looks like you has got to be married.
- Really?
How do I look?
- Great.
What do you think, Mar?
- Well, I think, uh, that I don't know why we're talking about whether or not he's married.
Even though he hasn't told us whether or not he is.
- Well, I'm not.
- Sit down, Chuck.
Thank you again for the lift.
I thought we were gonna spend the night in the gas station waiting for her car to be fixed.
I don't know what I'm gonna do about that car, Mar.
Three new batteries in two weeks.
I'm getting sick of driving into gas stations and saying, "A gallon of gasoline and a new battery, please".
I'll tell you, your car may not be much, but you've fixed your apartment up great.
-  Thank you.
- We like it.
How long have you lived here?
- About eight months.
- Two years.
You see, Chuck, I moved in first.
Ah.
Now, that that's beautiful.
Yeah, we like it.
You can see almost the entire skyline of downtown Minneapolis.
Oh, yeah.
I, uh I didn't notice that.
I was looking at the maple tree out there.
Oh, yes.
Every morning, we go out there on our little balcony and get fresh maple syrup for our pancakes.
But I guess nobody's really interested in simple, old-fashioned girls anymore.
Uh, listen.
Speaking of pancakes, - would anyone like a cup of coffee?
- We grind it ourselves.
No, thanks.
Really, I've got to get going.
I'm a little late for a meeting now.
Would, uh Would you like to have dinner with me Saturday night?
Oh!
Oh, uh, well - I realize it's short notice, but - Oh, no, no.
Short notice is when you ask me Sunday morning for Saturday night.
Chuck, I would love to have dinner with you.
- Well, great.
How's 8:00?
- It's a nice hour.
- Nice meeting you, Mary.
- Nice meeting you, and thank you again for the ride.
My pleasure.
I'll see you Saturday night, huh?
Yes.
Saturday, Chuck.
Bye.
Mary, did you notice what just happened here?
Well, let's see.
Uh, you mean, you accepted a date?
That's right.
An extremely attractive person had his choice of asking two women out you and me.
And he chose me.
That doesn't happen too often.
Well, I guess he just prefers the old-fashioned type.
And this apartment Why did you tell him it was ours?
A guy like that walks in here and admires the place, you want me to tell him it's not mine?
Rhoda, that's not exactly honest.
What do you mean, "not exactly honest"?
It's a lie.
Okay, will you just stop kidding for a minute, - because I'd like to say something.
- What?
No, I wouldn't.
Because if I do say something about whether or not you should go out with Chuck, - I know that you're gonna think that I'm - You're jealous.
- Jealous.
- No, not at all.
Honestly, how much do you know about him?
Look, it's not like it was a pickup in a bar.
Okay, so we met him in a gas station.
It wasn't just any gas station.
They sell name-brand gasoline there.
Okay.
Forget it.
I'm sorry I mentioned it.
You know, though, Mar.
There is one little thing I'd like to know about Chuck.
- What's that?
- His religion.
- Makes a difference to you?
- You bet it does.
I'd have to convert by Saturday night.
Okay, people.
Cut the work.
I got an announcement to make.
I just found out we're gonna be preempted tonight.
The first guy that says "No news is good news" is fired.
- What happened, Lou?
- The parade we're carrying is running late.
Uh, at last count, there were still 12 floats, and 5 high-school bands to go.
- Why is it running so late?
- They made the mistake of putting the senior citizens' band in front.
Preempted by a crummy parade.
Don't worry about being preempted, Ted.
It's not me I'm worried about.
It's my poor TVviewers.
Oh, Ted.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were k-kidding.
What's happening with Rhoda and that guy?
Are they still dating?
- You mean Chuck?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Are they still going to those expensive places for lunch and dinner?
Well, Murray, I'm sure Mr. Grant isn't interested in all this.
Don't worry about me.
I'm not even listening.
Do you know that she still hasn't told him that we're not roommates?
Last night I had to go to a movie I didn't want to see just because he was coming over for dinner.
No kidding?
What's the movie?
That, uh That's not the point, Ted.
Well, what is the point?
The point is that she is very interested in him, and I would be delighted for her, except that one thing bothers me.
- What's that, Mary?
- Well, he keeps spending all this money on her, and he doesn't seem to do anything for a living.
You know, I have examined myself very honestly, trying to figure out whether I am suspicious because I'm genuinely concerned or, you know, a little jealous.
- Why don't you talk to Rhoda about it?
- I can't do that.
I mean, she already thinks that I'm a little jealous.
But I'm not.
I just honestly don't want to see her get hurt.
Okay.
Okay.
Some of this I couldn't help overhearing.
And I know what you mean.
Why?
Because I am the father of three daughters.
And once in a while, one of'em would bring home a boy I felt sure was up to no good.
It used to drive me crazy wondering what was going on.
Just drove me right up the wall.
But I learned three things.
I learned that you have to let people make their own mistakes.
I learned that I was wrong about almost every suspicion I had.
I learned how to follow somebody in a car without being spotted.
- Chuck's not here yet, huh?
- Uh, no.
Oh, good.
I'd hate not to be living here when he shows up.
Hey, Rhoda.
How much longer is this gonna go on being our place?
Listen, Mar.
I'm going to tell him soon.
I'm waiting for the right moment.
Do you have any turpentine at your apartment?
What do you mean, up at my apartment?
This is my apartment.
- Do you have any turpentine?
- Sure.
I use it to take my makeup off.
- Why should I have turpentine?
- I don't know.
I just need it.
Why don't you call an all-night turpentine store?
Maybe they'll deliver.
Mary, look.
Before Chuck gets here, I got to ask you something.
Do you ever take gifts from the guys you're dating?
Well, uh, depends.
Like what?
Like, uh Well, like, uh Like, uh, a car.
A car?
He gave you a car?
No, he didn't give me a car.
He offered me a car.
A used car.
His car used.
Rhoda, his expensive car used is worth three other cars new.
Hey, look.
It's not as wild as it sounds.
He had a reason.
What reason could he have for offering you his car?
I said I liked it.
Rhoda, I hope you don't think I'm being overly concerned, but I think that offering you a car is not normal.
That's what I thought, Mar.
And there's been other things I've been worried about too.
- Like what?
- Well, like, he asked me, does it make any difference what he does for a living.
I said, "Of course not" lying through my teeth.
The way I figure it, any man who says, "Does it make any difference what I do for a living" is probably not a United States senator.
All right.
Let's try to figure it out.
Now, who has lots of money and plenty of free time and can't even mention what his work is?
Mary, I have been up with that one all night long.
And I can only come up with two occupations: spying and organized crime.
Rhoda, there are no spies in Minneapolis.
Okay.
All right.
I know he's not a spy.
I'm as sure of that as I am that he is in organized crime.
- Rhoda!
- Think about it, Mar.
He drives a foreign car black.
He's spending a lot of money.
A lot.
And he never seems to work.
Besides that, he's always going off to meetings somewhere.
Well, now, that's something.
Organized criminals do meet a lot, don't they to plan and everything.
- Right.
That's my feeling.
- Nah.
It can't be.
-  - Oh, that's him.
I don't know what I'm being so picky about.
Back home in New York, anybody out on bail was considered to be a professional man.
Hi.
Sorry I'm a little late.
- Hi, Mary.
How are you?
- Good.
Fine, thanks.
And you?
- Good.
Fine, thanks.
- You don't have any turpentine with you, do you?
-  - Just ran out.
You're painting that?
Yeah, I thought I would.
Why?
Well, I mean, it's wood, and wood is so beautiful.
I mean, it probably took about a hundred years for it to get that way.
You're just gonna slop gunk all over it?
Uh-uh.
No, I won't.
I won't do that.
- I mean, you can.
It's all right with me.
- No, no, I won't.
It's just my, uh You should put a little natural stain on it.
Natural stain.
I'll do that.
Oh, listen, Rhoda, I promised somebody I'd stop by and say hello tonight.
- Besides, I'd like you two to meet each other.
- Okay.
Who is it?
My Uncle Frank.
Well, he's not really my uncle, but he's an old friend of the family my godfather.
His godfather.
- You don't mind, do you?
- Oh, no, no.
Of course not.
It should be interesting.
I don't think we'll be back too late, Mary.
Bye, kid.
- Bye.
-  See ya.
Mary?
I guess she went out.
- Good.
- Chuck!
- She always seems to be here.
- Yeah, that's the trouble with having roommates.
- You want a drink?
- You got any scotch?
- I'll check.
- Okay.
Would you like some music?
- Yeah, music.
- How do you turn this thing on?
- I don't know.
- You don't know how to turn on your own record player?
Oh.
Well, see, Mary does that.
Sure.
We divide up the work around here.
I do the vacuuming and laundry; she turns on the record player.
- Did you say scotch?
- Or whatever.
What do you got?
- Well, you know, I can't find where she keeps her liquor.
- "Her liquor"?
Oh, well, yeah.
Uh, see, we each have our own supply, and I'm out.
Oh.
Well, it doesn't matter.
I mean, I didn't really want anything anyway.
Your godfather is really nice.
- Yeah, he liked you too.
I could tell.
- How could you tell?
Well, he talked about his work so much.
He never does that.
That sort of runs in your family.
Okay.
I guess I've been keeping it from you long enough.
If you want to keep it from me a little longer, it's all right.
No, no, no.
If you don't want to see me anymore after I've told you, I'll understand.
Chuck.
It would have to be pretty bad.
Sit down.
Okay.
Well, you see, for the last ten years, I worked for and was finally made a, uh, a vice president of the Hercules Lawn Mower and Snow Blower Company.
I wish you'd have been honest with me in the beginning.
I would have broken it off then.
I admit it occurred to me.
Sometimes I'd wake up in the middle of the night.
It would hit me Maybe he's the vice president of a lawn mower, snow blower corporation.
And I'd say, " No, Rhoda!
Put it out of your mind!
It can't be!
Not that"!
- Are you finished?
- Yeah, I'm finished.
- May I continue?
- Mm-hmm.
Would you sit down?
Now, one night a couple of months ago, I noticed that sales of our number sixty-two combined mower/blowers were down one percent.
And I was upset.
I mean, I was really upset.
I was taking my fourth antacid pill when it hit me.
I mean, what's the difference how many Hercules mower/blowers are sold in Minneapolis?
Offhand, I can't answer that question.
- I can't either.
That's why I quit.
- Quit?
- Ajob that had to pay, what, 20 - Thirty.
- Thousand dollars?
- Yeah.
I quit a couple months ago, and now my vacation is almost over because I've got just enough money left to do what I've always wanted to do since I was a kid.
Buy out a candy store.
Don't do it.
I did it last week.
It's not all it's cracked up to be.
Believe me.
Okay.
I won't interrupt you again, Chuck.
I promise.
I'm going to go back to college.
- All right.
- For two years.
- Okay.
- Because I want to get another degree.
Terrific.
So that I can become a, uh, forest ranger.
- Rhoda?
- Eucalyptus.
- What do you say?
Uh - You think I'm crazy for doing this, don't you?
No.
I don't think you're crazy.
- As long as forest rangers make 30,000 a year.
- No, it's more like 9,000.
You're crazy.
Rhoda, look.
I don't want to spend the rest of my life worrying about how to turn a four percent profit into a six percent profit.
- I can understand how you feel, Chuck.
I really can.
- You can?
What I can't understand is why you feel you have to do something about it.
Why don't you try it before you put it down?
- How can you try a thing like that?
- I'm going on a camping trip this weekend.
- Come with me.
- Oh, gee, Chuck.
l Oh, come on.
It's just one weekend in the woods.
Uh, listen.
I can I can come back later.
Oh, no, no, Mary.
Look, as a matter of fact, why don't you come too?
A bunch of us are going on a camping trip this weekend.
Hey.
Hey, that sounds like fun.
I haven't gone camping in years.
- You mean you did that one time?
- Oh, sure.
Well, I'd better go now.
Look, Rhoda, I'll call you tomorrow about the hike, huh?
- Yeah, about the hike.
Call.
- Good night, Mar.
Good night.
- Come.
You'll enjoy it.
- Okay.
Good night, Chuck.
Good-bye, Chuck.
I should have known.
Rhoda Pelligrini.
It just doesn't sound right.
Okay.
What did you find out?
What does he do?
What?
He's a forest freak, that's what.
- Just because he asked you to go on a hike?
- No.
Because he just gave up a vice presidency of a big company to go back to college to study to become get this a forest ranger.
A forest ranger?
Uh, why?
Mmm.
He had some stupid idea about being happy.
Why, oh, why couldn't I have met him five years ago?
By now I could have had him so far in debt he couldn't even think about being a forest ranger.
- I don't even know what they do.
- Well, they, uh They stand around in towers and look through, uh, you know, for forest fires.
- Yeah?
That's it?
- l Can you imagine me living up in a tree house with a guy in a Boy Scout hat?
Think of the exciting evenings when Chuck is there pressing leaves into a book.
Or, when we have Smokey the Bear over for dinner.
Hey, Rhoda, this is really a guy you like, right?
Oh, yeah.
Good point.
Okay, kid.
I'm gonna try it the hike.
- Maybe he's on to something.
- Good for you.
- Oh, Mary.
- What?
Oh.
All that fresh air.
My lungs have been raised on exhaust fumes and industrial waste.
I'm not sure they could take the shock.
Tonight this reporter will be at the Twin Cities' German/ American society to serve as a judge in the annual potato pancake contest.
This is Ted Baxter wishing you out there in television land a wonderful weekend, and to all my German friends, auf Wiedersehen.
- Oh, boy.
- Now that he's demolished English, he's branching out.
I'll say.
Oh, Mary.
Marie wanted me to ask you over for Sunday brunch.
Oh, gee, Murray.
I'd love to, but I can't.
I'm going on an overnight hike.
Hey, not bad for making up a quick excuse.
No, it's not an excuse.
I really am going hiking.
- Who are you going hiking with?
- With Rhoda and Chuck and his friends.
Chuck?
Isn't that the same guy you were so suspicious about?
Yeah.
It turns out he's an executive who's dropped out and is going back to college to become a forest ranger.
- Hmm.
- You have to admire him for that.
- If I didn't have a wife and kids - Yeah?
I probably still wouldn't do it.
- Hi, guys.
- Speaking of dropouts.
Murray, really, have you ever thought about it?
If you could do something different with your life, anything at all, what would you do?
Oh, I'd do a lot of things.
I'd climb some of the world's great peaks.
I'd build a little raft and sail it to Tahiti.
Wallpaper my rec room.
When you're married, you learn to compromise.
- How about you, Mr. Grant?
- Me?
I'm happy just doing what I'm doing.
I'm happy running this newsroom, and I'm happy telling people that this conversation doesn't interest me.
Uh, wait a minute.
Don't I get a chance?
Sure, Ted.
What would you do?
- If I could be anything I wanted to be?
- Right.
Anything.
I'd be Cary Grant.
That's a person.
We are talking about a way of life.
- I don't understand.
- What else is new?
Good night.
See you all Monday.
- Happy hiking.
-  Auf Wiedersehen, Mar.
Now, look, Ted.
Just forget about a specific person.
What would you like to do if you dropped out?
- You mean, if I couldn't be Cary Grant?
- Right.
I don't know.
I haven't given it much thought.
I guess I'd be a king.
Hey, Rhoda, you want to come in?
I want to.
I don't know if I can.
Oh, boy.
All I want to do is stand under a hot shower.
Me too.
I may not even take off my clothes.
Oh, boy, Mary.
I ache all over.
You want some help?
No, I think I can ache all by myself.
You probably wouldn't be so exhausted if you hadn't carried all that extra junk.
The makeup case, all the extra clothes.
You were the only girl on the hike who dressed for dinner.
That's true.
But you'll never know the thrill of having a raccoon watch you change.
Mary, tell me something, 'cause I missed it.
Why do people hike?
You learned something about survival, didn't you?
I learned about survival in the New York subways.
Okay, Rhoda, but a forest is a lot prettier than a subway.
It depends on the stop.
Aw, Mary, let's face it.
I just didn't fit in with that group of Chuck's friends.
All those tall, Nordic, Amazon girls with the long, blond hair and rosy cheeks.
Wait a minute.
I was on that hike.
I don't have long, blond hair.
But my cheeks do get a little rosy, don't they?
And your personality is definitely blond.
I know what you mean about Chuck's friends, though.
I don't think I've ever been in a group of eight where three of the men were named Sven.
'Course, last night around the campfire, you got to admit that was fun.
- Singing the old camp songs - Oh, yeah.
Sitting around a fire singing "A Hundred Bottles of Beer on the Wall".
Terrific.
Wouldn't have been so bad if when we'd finally gotten down to the one bottle of beer on the wall, one of those Svens hadn't yelled, "One more time"!
When I want wildlife, I want wild life.
Not wildlife.
- Hi.
Rhoda here?
- Just barely.
Come on in.
I was, uh, just leaving.
Uh, Rhoda, if you want me, I'll be upstairs at Florence's.
- Who?
- Florence's.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Florence.
Uh, listen, you didn't have so much fun on the hike, huh?
- What makes you say that?
- 'Cause you kept telling me how much you hated it.
- I was right.
- Hmm.
Chances are if we do it again, you won't like it any better.
Actually, I think I'll like it worse.
And it's not really terribly appealing to a girl like you to be going out with a 35-year-old student, is it?
Especially when that student's determined to become a forest ranger.
We don't seem to have too much going for us, do we?
I guess not.
- Maybe I'd better just bow out of the picture then.
- I didn't say that.
Did you hear me say that?
I don't think a person in this room heard me say that.
I don't want you to bow out.
Is that clear?
I want you to bow with So we have totally different values.
Let's not try to change one another.
Let's just accept each other as we are, huh?
And see what happens.
See what happens?
Uh, Florence isn't home.
And, uh, I don't know where she keeps her key.
Do you know where Florence keeps her key?
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, Mary, it's very lucky I happen to have a duplicate.
- Good.
- Of her key, right.
Bye.
Hey, Chuck?
Was it really all that bad being vice president of the Hercules Lawn Mower, Snow Blower Company, huh?
Ah, don't answer me.
I promised myself I would never, ever ask you that question.
But was it really that bad?
- What is that you're reading?
- A book on tree diseases.
- What?
- A book on tree diseases.
Is anything wrong with learning about oak tree root rot?
No, no.
I guess not.
What are you making faces?
There is nothing wrong with acquainting one's self with the various parasites which present our national park service with one of its biggest problems.
- Besides, it works two ways.
- Rhoda, aren't you working on getting Chuck to go back into lawn mowers?
No.
I would never attempt to change his interest in trees.
I'm just trying to redirect it a little.
Do you know how much money there is in lumber?
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
How will you make it on your own This world is awfully big And, girl this time you're all alone But it's time you started living It's time you let someone else do some giving Love is all around No need to waste it You can have the town Why don't you take it You might just make it After all You might just make it after all Hi, guys.
Hey, Gordy.
How are things in the world of sports?
How would I know?
I'm the weatherman.
Oh.
Yes.
Why do I keep thinking you're a sportscaster?
- Anyway, Barry thinks you're doing a great job, though.
- Barry?
Our new station manager.
The one we call Mr. Phelps.
Keep up the good work.
Our audience sure loves that great sports stuff.
Uh, weather stuff.
Mary, what's that you have all over your dress?
- Yellow feathers.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.
Why do you have yellow feathers all over your dress?
Because I was trying to console Big Chicken.
Well, I find it hard to sympathize with a grown man that puts on a chicken suit every day and shows cartoons to three-year-olds.
Murray, you ought to try.
Uncle Potato got a higher rating than Big Chicken, and Mr. Phelps fired him.
Gee, I'm sorry to hear that.
He's really a nice guy.
- Who are you sorry about?
- Big Chicken.
Mr. Phelps just fired him.
Too bad.
He was a great chicken.
Oh, Lou?
Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou.
What is it, Ted?
Just my whole life, my whole career, my life.
Can't it wait?
Lou, they just fired Big Chicken.
Since when have you ever been concerned about another human being?
This time I'm concerned.
Big Chicken had a higher rating than I do.
Quit worrying.
Big Chicken had a higher rating than all of us, but I'm not worried.
Why should you?
They always blame the star.
Besides, I don't think Barry likes me.
Ted, he hasn't been here long enough not to like you.
He's only been here a couple weeks.
It takes three weeks not to like you.
I know.
But he hasn't thanked me for my gift yet.
You're still doing that, huh?
Buying gifts for the new station managers.
I'll never forget what you got the last one ten bucks.
Well, he was a hard person to shop for.
What did you get Phelps that he didn't thank you for?
An autographed copy of Winston Churchill's memoirs.
You know, he was the prime minister of England.
- Yeah, I heard a rumor.
- Well, it's true.
Where did you ever find a copy with Churchill's autograph?
No, no.
Not Churchill's.
Mine.
"To Barry from Ted".
Should have put my last name on it.
Now he'll think it's Ted Martin of Sales.
What am I gonna do?
He's gonna fire me.
I just know it.
Ted!
Calm down!
Phelps doesn't own this station.
Wild Jack Monroe owns this station.
I've seen a dozen Phelps in that job since I've been here.
I feel likeJ.
Edgar Hoover watching presidents of the United States come and go.
Now, if you're through, I've got a TV show to put on.
- Thanks, Lou.
- Mm-hmm.
-  - Newsroom.
Just a moment, please.
Ted, telephone.
- Find out who it is.
- It's Mr. Phelps.
Hello, Mr. Phelps, sir.
What?
Now?
Oh, no.
I'm not busy.
I'll be I'll be right there.
Yes, I'll tell them.
Barry Mr. Phelps wants to see us all immediately.
- I'll get Mr. Grant.
- All except Lou.
Let's go, gang.
- Where is everybody?
- Uh, they went to the bank.
- Where are you going?
- Uh, to the bank.
Say hello to everybody for me.
I'm sorry I haven't gotten to know everybody yet.
I've only been on the job for two weeks.
Only a couple of weeks, but you've done a heck of a job.
Right, gang?
I imagine you all know why we're here.
Uh, no, I don't.
Our sales manager can sum it up for us.
Ev?
- I can't sell the news.
- Ev can't sell the news.
Why not?
Mary?
Uh, why can't Ev sell the news?
Uh, I don't know.
Ev is one of the top men in his field.
- That's why I listen hard when he says - I can't sell the news.
Barry, I've been giving the problem serious thought, and I can only say that my fan mail is up 28 percent.
In other words, I feel the source of the situation may be behind the cameras.
Gordy, we haven't heard from you yet.
Oh, by the way, I must say you're doing crackerjack work handling sports.
I'm the weatherman.
Of course.
You're the weatherman, yeah.
Mary, someone is letting us down.
Mr. Grant is very happy with the way everyone's been doing their jobs.
So if there's a problem, shouldn't Mr. Grant be here - Oh.
- Precisely.
How would you judge Lou Grant's work?
- I don't judge his work.
He judges mine.
- Heavy.
- Quite frankly, Mr. Phelps - Please, don't get upset, Mary.
The matter has already been decided.
- Decided?
- Yes.
You can go.
Thank you.
Uh, I'm sorry I took so long.
There was a long line at the bank.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Here it comes now.
A more miserable lot I've never seen.
Hey, everybody, come on.
Let's all have a meeting.
Now, there's been lots of rumors going around about people being fired.
I want to tell you all now that not one of you is gonna be fired.
Hey, that was a pep talk.
What's with you?
- I, uh, have to go back to the bank.
- How do you like that?
I give you job security, and right away you start taking advantage of me.
I was only kidding.
So, be with us at 11:00 tonight, when our whole WJ M news team will be back.
Gordy Howard with the latest in spor weather.
And yours truly, Ted Baxter.
See you then.
Pretty good show tonight.
Good film, good pace.
Only thing it didn't have was commercials.
Maybe that's why it had good pace.
Right.
Right.
- Good show tonight, Ted.
-  Hey, listen.
I've got some ideas for some new features for this show to give it a little pizzazz, huh?
Okay, we'll talk about it tomorrow.
If they're gonna fire a guy, why don't they just tell him instead of doing it like this?
I'll tell you one thing.
It's not gonna be Mr. Phelps who tells him.
He'd enjoy it too much.
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night.
Mary, I can't take it anymore.
I know what you're thinking, and I can't take it.
I'm not thinking about you, Ted.
All right.
I did blame Lou for our low ratings.
Maybe I am the main reason he's being fired, but that doesn't mean I don't love him.
It was either him or me.
Can't you understand that?
Oh-ho-ho.
Put him down for a physical.
Mr. Grant, I'd like to talk to you.
What's up?
Well, it's a little awkward, but when I was at the bank today I wasn't at the bank.
I was in Mr. Phelps's office.
- Yeah?
- He sent for me.
You don't work for him.
If he's dissatisfied with your work, let him tell me about it.
Mr. Grant, it's not my work that he's dissatisfied with.
Ohh.
- Then that's what's been bugging you?
- Uh, yeah.
- Aren't Aren't you - No, not by a long shot.
- I figured I'd get the ax.
- You did?
Uh-huh.
I was worried for a while there that it wasn't gonna be me.
It's probably the best thing that ever happened to me.
- No, you're just saying that to make me feel better.
- Now, look.
When you're in TV, changing jobs is a way of life.
Ten years in one job is too long.
I've been turning down offer after offer for years because I was too lazy to move.
All I have to do is just pick up the phone.
Can I get somebody for you then?
Would you mind waiting till they fire me, please?
Would you?
Okay.
Okay.
Get me Sid Winnick.
Sid Winnick.
Yes, sir.
Is Mr. Winnick in?
Lou Grant's calling.
Thank you.
Mr. Winnick's on two, Mr. Grant.
Sid.
About that job you've been pitching at me for eight and a half months is it, now?
Well, I'm suddenly available.
Hmm?
I'm 45.
What's that got to do with anything?
Youth movement?
Oh, that's beautiful.
You're 63 years old, and you're having a youth movement.
I'm all in favor of your movement, Sid.
Why don't you fire yourself!
Uh, if I'd known I was gonna bomb, I would have shut the door.
- I'm sorry.
- A few months ago, they had to have me, but now That's just one.
You said you had lots of offers.
I did.
They were all from Sid.
All right, look.
Mr. Phelps isn't the last word around here.
It's Wild Jack Monroe that owns this place.
What about him?
I never should have left that old newspaper.
But it was those mergers that was driving me nuts.
I got tired of telling people I worked for the Times-Globe- Herald-.
Journal-Chronicle.
I still should have stayed there.
You know how I got this job?
I went into a saloon, got drunk, fell down and met Wild Jack Monroe under a table.
- Where was that?
In Hollywood?
- No, right here.
Whoever heard of a cowboy from Minnesota?
The guy made 300 grade-B Westerns, owns half the world and lives on a ranch right outside Minneapolis.
I think he raises snow.
- Why don't you go see him?
- Because I've got nothing to see him about.
That's why.
I'm not exactly a has-been.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Associate producer.
What do you think you're doing?
I thought you'd like to talk.
Mary.
You're very nice.
But what I really would like is to be alone.
Okay?
Okay.
Forty-five years old.
If I was in politics, they'd call me "the kid".
- Hi.
Did you get in touch with Gordy?
- Yeah, he's on his way.
- Did you get Ted?
- I think so.
I called three or four times.
Every time I mentioned we were planning a strike, he hung up.
Well, the strike is out.
- What?
- My union won't let me.
They'll only let me strike for what they want.
My union shop steward can't understand why I want to strike to save the job of someone in management.
Okay, what about a very strong protest?
Well, that's one idea.
We'll discuss it when the others get here.
- Like an hors d'oeuvre?
- You weren't supposed to serve anything.
- It wasn't any trouble.
- This is supposed to be a strike meeting.
I hate to tell you this, but when the Teamsters have a strike meeting, they only serve cold hors d'oeuvres.
- Hi, Gordy.
- Hi, Mary.
- I think Ted'll be here in a minute.
- What do you mean, you think?
When I was parking my car, I saw him circling the block.
He's probably afraid he's being followed.
Yeah.
You know, Ted doesn't exactly take it too lightly when he thinks someone's gonna speak out against management.
By the way, I can't strike.
- What, you're union too?
- Mm-mm.
My wife.
She just told me we're gonna have another baby.
- Oh, Gordy, congratulations.
That's marvelous.
- Thank you.
What are you hoping for, a boy or a girl?
We got a girl, so I hope it's a boy.
Hors d'oeuvres, babies This isn't a protest meeting, it's a party.
Thank heavens.
I thought we were having a protest meeting.
Look who dropped in.
Did you get tired of driving around the block?
You saw me coming, huh?
I wonder if anyone else did.
- Ted!
- I mean someone from the other side.
Your other side, not mine.
I'm not taking part in this.
Will you please come in and relax?
No one saw you come in.
But we need you.
I never thought I'd say this, but you're the strongest weapon we've got.
Well, we just lost.
I know.
You think I'm afraid to join in with you, don't you?
- You bet.
- Well, I'm here, aren't I?
And I made a decision to come here and listen to your arguments.
And if they're strong enough, I'll stand with you a hundred percent.
Okay.
All right.
Lou Grant is the best news director our station ever had, and he is about to be fired by a man who knows absolutely nothing about news.
- Right.
- Plus the fact that every one of us in this room owes him so much, we couldn't ever repay him.
Add to that the fact that when some of us thought our jobs were in jeopardy, it was Lou Grant who was the first to put his job on the line for us.
- That's the truth.
- Right on.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to do better than that.
The only way we're gonna get him on our side is to convince him there's more money in this.
I just don't like this strike business.
- We aren't gonna strike, Ted.
- We're not?
No.
We're just thinking about presenting Phelps with some kind of petition.
What good is a petition with three names on it?
- But we're four.
- No, you're three.
- I vote we throw him out.
- Now, wait a minute, Murray.
Maybe Ted has some ideas on this.
Ted, if you were about to lose your job - I'm not about to lose my job.
- I know, I know, I know.
But if you were, what would you do?
You mean, if Phelps were about to fire me?
Hmm.
I'd see the man who owns the station Wild Jack Monroe.
You know, that's not a bad idea.
Maybe Lou should go see him.
- No, Mr. Grant would never beg.
- That's exactly what I mean.
How can you help a man who refuses to beg?
What if all of us went to see him?
Are you kidding?
With a name like that, he must really be a weirdo.
Murray, all cowboys have names like that.
Uh-uh.
He was just Jack Monroe in the movies.
He got the "wild" just for being himself.
Look, Mary.
I think a girl should go see him.
- Why?
- Because the guys don't wanna.
All right.
Okay.
I will go see Wild Jack Monroe.
- Terrific.
- I'm glad that's cleared up.
- Gordy, how weird is he?
- He is weird.
Yahoo!
Wahoo!
Hot dang, I got one there.
Hey, and another one bit the dust.
- Mr. Monroe, uh, Mr. Monroe, - Heigh-ho, Fred!
I came to see you about Lou Grant.
- Lou Grant?
- He said that you personally hired him.
To be the news director at WJ M. Oh, yeah.
My station here in town.
Mr. Phelps is gonna fire him.
Oh, Slim Phelps, my new station manager.
- He's gonna fire him, huh?
- Yes, sir.
Is he one of them radicals?
Mr. Grant?
No.
I'm always kidding him about being too conservative.
Young lady, there ain't no such a-thing as being too conservative.
You know, I said I was kidding.
You know, that's one thing: You can't be too careful these days.
What with them longhaired hippies a-running around with them wild clothes on, why, I can't Oh, I'm okay.
I'm a cowboy.
I think I need a shot of who-hit-John.
So So they're firing him, huh?
How old is this here, uh, Grant feller?
He's 45.
Amazing.
Forty-five.
You know, it was on my 45th birthday that the studio called me in and told me I was through.
That's when I found out.
You know that building they fired me in?
- I owned it!
- You didn't know that?
No.
You see, I had this here accountant feller.
And unbeknownst to me, he'd been investing my money for me.
You name it, I owned it lock, stock and barrel, thanks to good old Slim Schwartz.
That would be your accountant.
Yeah.
And I thought I was washed up.
And you weren't, and neither is Lou Grant.
That's why I came to see you.
I make it a point not to butt in to the way my businesses is handled, but let me just kind of twist it around in my mind a while.
- I'll be a-getting back to you, Miss - Richards.
- I'll be a-seeing you, Slim.
- Okay.
Yee-hoo!
Ah-hoo!
Wahoo!
- Mr. Grant?
- Finally got it.
Want to know something?
Those pink slips you get?
They really are pink.
Red that's what pink slips should be.
Or black.
You fire a ballerina with a pink slip, not a newsman.
- But Mr. Grant - Don't talk.
You start talking, pretty soon you'll be trying to organize a farewell party with punch and cupcakes.
And everybody will chip in and buy me a shaving kit for a going-away present.
There'll be a secretary there who'll come over to me and do this  - Not for me.
- Mr. Grant, what I'm trying to tell you is you might not have to leave.
I went to see Wild Jack Monroe.
I do not remember asking you for any help.
Here's the last order I can give you, Mary Lay off.
- I don't want to lay off.
- Lay off.
Lou?
I just wanted to give you this little token of my - It's a shaving kit.
- Thanks.
Oh, yeah.
I'm getting out of here.
Which one's Lou Grant?
- I'm Lou Grant.
What about it?
- I want to talk to you in private.
- Okay.
Let's go in my office.
- No!
When Wild Jack Monroe talks private, he don't go, they go.
Hey, you, Slim.
You're doing a great job with that sports news.
Keep it up.
- But I don't do - I said keep it up.
Don't worry.
We'll get a hundred Indians and come back.
Not you, little lady.
Didn't you and me have a hoop-de-do one time or other?
You could call it that.
I lost four teeth myself.
Hot dang!
That was the best dang fight I ever had.
Hey.
The little lady tells me you're getting fired.
Little lady's got a big mouth.
Watch that, boy.
That's a woman.
Yeah, but it's a woman with a big mouth.
See, what Mr. Grant means is Hey, I do not need an interpreter.
And I don't need any favors from you.
I don't want this job.
- I'll work someplace else.
- I got a TV station in Boise, Idaho.
- Keep talking.
- You got the job.
- Hey.
- "Hey" what?
- I got a shaving kit and a job in Boise, Idaho.
- Yahoo!
I sure outfoxed you that time.
I already got me a TV news director in Boise, Idaho.
So I'll have to transfer you to in there.
Hey!
Come on out to the ranch house sometime; we'll open up a keg of nails.
Welcome back.
I suppose you feel like Mary Poppins or something.
Well, no, actually.
I'm a little disappointed.
I thought I was next in line for your job.
What kind of a going-away card is this?
"To Lou from Ted.
Forgive me, but I'm weak".
- Well, uh, that could mean a million things.
- Could mean he's weak.
How do you go about giving back a shaving kit?
I don't know.
I've never had one as a gift.
I never have either.
I think I'll keep this one.
Sometimes I don't know whether I'm working or hallucinating.
Yeah, Big Chicken's back.
It turns out that Big Chicken is Wild Jack Monroe's favorite show.
