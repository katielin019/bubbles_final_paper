{START OF EPISODE 1}
Zena's here to fill the candy machine.
Hi, gang!
I got it, man!
I'm in!
I got here for the first time.
Can you believe this?
A bunch of adults fighting over a candy bar.
Hold that thought, Bobby, she's brought malted balls.
Oh, yeah?
Bobby, seniority, seniority No, wait, I'm second.
Hey, Zena, how you doing?
Terrific, thanks.
Hey, Tony-- here's that organic shampoo I was telling you about.
Oh, thanks, Zena.
What do I owe you?
First one is free.
Then after I get you hooked You know, Zena, my kids just love those puppets you made for them.
Thanks again, really.
Oh, that's okay.
Bobby, you know, I went to see that O'Neill revival you were telling me about.
Oh, yeah?
What did you think?
I thought that the only thing that could have made it better was you in it.
Oh, you noticed that, too, huh?
Out of the way, out of the way!
No!
Hey!
No!
Out of the way or I'll call you last for a cab.
Oh!
Oh!
It's so easy.
Whoo!
The first Baby Ruth.
M-m-m-mm!
Why does the first one always taste the best?
How should we know?
You always eat the first one.
Oh, silly me.
You may now resume fighting over the stale ones.
Well, it's something.
Oh, hey, Zena?
Have you got change for a dollar because?
Zena?
Hey!
Oh, sorry.
Boy, he's really something, isn't he?
Louie?
Hoo!
There's an exterminator who wants him to pose for the side of his truck.
He must take a lot of ribbing from you drivers.
Yeah, none of it's good-natured.
Now, I guess that's natural making fun of the boss.
Bet you don't even notice how cute he is.
Louie?
Yeah.
Louie?
!
Yeah!
I don't know, maybe it's me.
Maybe I just get turned on by powerful men.
Louie!
?
Yeah.
You know, all these weeks watching him up there keeping this huge operation humming.
Boy, if I wasn't so shy, I'd Uh, you'd what?
Oh, Elaine would you introduce me to him?
Louie?
Oh, Zena, um, that's not a good idea.
Why not?
It's a bad idea.
Oh, I see what you're trying to say.
Yeah.
You want him for yourself.
Hey, what happened?
Zena says I want Louie for myself.
What are you talking about?
Then I take it you don't.
No!
Then there's no problem.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What's the problem there isn't one of?
Zena wants to meet Louie.
I could never do it on my own.
I need somebody to introduce me.
I'm trying to save her from herself, but I mean, I got nothing to worry about, right?
I mean, who in this garage is going to introduce her to Louie?
Elaine, damn it, she's an adult.
You don't lead people's lives.
Hey, Zena, I'll introduce you to Louie.
What would you like me to say?
Say you think we'd like each other.
Okay.
You're going to say that?
That's what she wants me to say, and that's what I'm going to say.
Come on, Zena.
Stay close by me.
He's not in a cage for nothing.
All right, listen up here, everybody!
New rule here, new rule.
Yes, we do take out cabs with bald tires.
We do.
Hey, uh, Louie Louie?
What?
Louie, I'd like you to meet Zena Sherman.
Zena, Louie DePalma.
Zena wanted to meet you.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I think maybe you'll, uh like each other.
Oh.
How do you do?
Hi.
All right, if you'll excuse me now, I'll leave you two alone.
I have to get some bald tires on the road.
I like your goodies.
How long you been in this sweets field?
Almost a year now.
You do it very well.
Um my cousin is getting married tomorrow night.
Would you like to go to the wedding?
It's a free dinner.
Thank you.
I'd really like to.
Swell.
Uh, oh, and it is a wedding, so dress up a little, okay?
What are you looking at me for?
She wanted me to introduce her, so I introduced her.
So, what's the big deal?
It's just one date.
What's the worst thing that can happen?
She could have his baby.
Ooh!
Sorry I'm late  but Zena and I had another one of those nights.
I didn't even have time to change.
You'll have to excuse my attire.
She ripped the shirt off my back.
But I guess when you're burning the candle at both ends for five weeks straight, you're going to have to pay the price.
Give me three cards, all right?
He's driving me crazy.
There's only one consolation in this whole sordid affair.
Yeah, what's that?
I didn't introduce them.
All right, now remember our agreement: Nobody asks him nothing.
Right.
I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.
I'm only human, I mean.
How much pleasure can one man endure?
Isn't anybody the least bit curious as to why I didn't have time to change this morning or yesterday, or the day before, ad infinitum?
What do you got, what do you got?
I got nothing.
Alex, I thought at least you would be interested in the intimate details.
After all, you are kind of responsible.
I don't want you to do that anymore.
Do what?
I don't do that.
Yes, you do, you do it almost continuously.
I don't!
Yes, you do.
You do it every time you mention Zena.
You just did it.
I did?
Really?
I don't even know I'm doing it.
I'll tell you what: The next time I do it, hold up your hand.
Look, I don't have to hold up my hand.
You do it every time you mention her name!
You're crazy!
Zena.
I don't even realize I'm doing it.
But I'll tell you one thing, Rieger, you'd be hee-hee-heeing, too, if you were having experiences with a woman like Go away.
I got to tell somebody.
I don't even let people I like touch my hair.
Whisper in my ear and you'll be whispering for life.
Nah!
Hey, Louie, they want you upstairs.
Okeydoke.
Listen, Zena is going to be in any minute now.
Tell her that I'm going to pick her up tonight at 8:00 sharp.
We're going to go out to dinner.
At least, we're going to try to go out to dinner.
That's what I say every night.
* Macho, macho man * I've got to be a macho man * I'm a macho man I'll tell you, I just can't understand Zena.
You know what my theory is?
My theory is that, since she's not a stupid person she must see some quality in Louie that we've always missed.
Yeah, my theory is that Louie must have some redeeming virtue that we've always overlooked.
My theory is, Zena is nuts.
That makes more sense.
Hi, everybody!
Hey, Zena, how you doing?
Oh, hi, Zena.
Hey, Alex, could I talk to you for a minute, alone?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, would you guys?
Okay, shoot.
I know I'm imposing, but I hoped you wouldn't mind.
I mean, you did bring Louie and me together.
I have a feeling when I die, they'll put that on my stone.
Yeah?
Uh, it's kind of personal.
It embarrasses me to talk about it.
Well All right, we've been seeing each other for five weeks, and, uh, being normal, healthy adults it's natural we'd have some physical involvement.
Yeah.
So why haven't we?
I mean, you know Louie.
What is it?
Why won't he touch me?
You mean he hasn't touched you?
I can't even get him to hold my hand.
Gee, Zena, that's too bad.
Good evening, everybody.
Sorry I can't join you, but I got a hot date tonight.
Well, maybe I'll stick around for just one.
Tommy?
Yeah-- beer?
Yeah, beer.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Zena doesn't expect me for another half hour, and I like to be a little late so she's really chomping at the bit.
Uh, Louie I know.
I did it on purpose.
Boy, oh boy, I finally found a girl who can keep up with me.
Ugh!
Jeez!
She's jealous!
Louie, Zena and I had a long talk today about things that happened and about things that didn't happen.
You did?
Uh, excuse us.
Alex has this problem.
It'll be okay.
Don't worry, relax.
You She's lying.
Yeah?
Why would she lie?
I don't know-- she just is.
Alex, it's me against her.
How do you know I'm lying?
Oh, yeah.
All right, Louie, it's over.
No more talk about Zena, you understand?
Alex, Alex, I don't want you to leave with the wrong idea.
Let me explain.
Now look, Louie, I heard enough out of you today, all right?
Alex!
I got to open up to someone.
You're the only one I almost can stomach.
Aah, come on.
Alex, if you won't do it out of compassion-- out of pure humanity-- would you do it for money?
You want to pay me to listen?
I want you to do for me what you do for Bobby and Tony and the other guys.
Well, I am a little short this week.
Well, all right Great!
How much you want?
Well, that depends on what you have to say.
Sit down.
All right.
All right, here it is.
Here's the truth.
It's her fault.
For "her fault"?
!
You see, it's because she's I mean, how do I put this?
Alex she's my first.
Oh, come on, Louie, she's not your first.
Everybody knows that when you were driving a cab and tourists wanted to find out where the women were, you didn't tell them, you took them.
And whenever possible, you joined them.
Hold on, I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
I've had my share of women, and then some, and I've always left them happy.
I can't tell you how many told me, "Louie, this is crazy, I should pay you"!
That'll be another ten.
That's fair.
Look, you see, my thing with Zena is different.
I mean, it's the first time I ever had a girl who calls me to find out if I got home all right.
The first one to just take a walk with me.
The first one to surprise me with little gifts.
She's the first girl that ever did this to me.
Don't do that.
I had to show you.
You haven't got enough money in your pocket for that one.
Alex, what I'm trying to tell you is that Zena is the first girl I've ever been out with who the first girl I've ever been out with twice.
Oh, Zena's not your first girl, she's your first nice girl.
Yeah!
And I can't handle it!
I mean, I was brought up believing that there was nice girls and girls you had fun with and there was no mixing of the two.
I like Zena I really do.
But I can't even bring myself to kiss her.
Well, there's only one thing you can do, Louie: Break up with this lovely, warm person who obviously feels a great deal for you and spend the rest of your life floating through meaningless affairs with cheap strangers who you'll have to pay to satisfy your disgusting physical lust.
Great advice.
Coming!
Hi, I'm almost ready.
I got you some flowers.
Thanks.
I threw them away.
Why?
Because that's the kind of guy I am.
We're not going out tonight.
Why not?
Because that's the kind of night this is.
I think you better sit down.
You look tired, Louie.
Want me to rub your feet?
No.
Your shoulders?
No.
That little vein in your head?
No rubbing.
I I got something to say.
Sounds serious.
What is it?
Zena, I'm going to be straight with you.
We're splitting up.
Good-bye.
Why?
You really want to drag this out, don't you?
I just want to know why.
Why!
There's someone else.
Oh, I see.
Who?
: Who?
Donna Summer.
We had a little spat before I met you.
I couldn't take the pressure of the racial thing.
And besides, she's always shaking it in front of other guys.
It got to me.
I told her, "I don't want you moaning on records anymore".
This morning she gave me a call, we Stop it, Louie.
Just don't make up stories.
I think I deserve better than that.
I know what it is.
You think I'm too good for you.
Nah, you crazy?
It's just that you're too good, period.
I'm used to another kind of woman.
You're so nice.
I can't ever even think of relating to you in a nonverbal manner.
Oh, I see.
Louie, you know, when people like each other a lot they should be able to work things out.
I'm willing to try.
I'm nuts about you, Louie.
Well, you-you're hocking me all the time, right?
I mean, let me ask you a question.
Why are you nuts about me?
To tell you the truth, I've been asking myself that question.
My friends have been asking me that question, my parents.
The doorman's been asking me that question.
I don't know what to tell them.
But I know what to tell you.
You touch me.
Holy crap!
You know, all those nights when you left me at my doorstep I'd go into my bedroom and cry.
Take me to the place you cry.
What's going on?
I can't go in there, Zena!
Oh, open it!
No I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but this is really the end.
Okay, Louie!
All right.
Louie, would you just do me one last favor?
What's that?
How about a good-bye kiss?
Women!
It would mean a lot to me.
"It would mean a lot to me" All right!
Well, so long  You can go now, Louie.
That's easy for you to say.
Louie?
Yeah?
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
All right, all right, just stay where you are.
I'll send somebody for you.
Dummy!
Jeff Yeah.
go to 45th and Lexington and pick up Giambalvo.
Okay.
Latka!
What's the big idea sending Giambalvo out with a broken gas gauge?
If we paid you by the mistake, you'd own this place by now.
Okay, it's a deal.
Why do I always have to get on your back to get anything done around here?
You're a lazy, good-for-nothing, goldbricking foreigner.
All right.
I want I want to make a grievance.
Oh, you do?
Yes.
Oh, you want to see the shop steward?
Yes.
Okay.
All right?
All right, that would be Ben Geretski.
All right.
Mm.
All right, Ben Ben Ben Geretski?
Ben Ben Geretski?
Hello?
Where is he?
He's off today.
Then what should I do?
Come here.
The rule is if the steward isn't around then you report your grievance to the shift supervisor.
Okay.
The shift supervisor.
Who is who is this?
Is me.
What seems to be the problem?
Well, you're you're the problem.
You're making me problem because you're always yelling at me and you're always calling me names and you always make my life bad and you make me feel stupid.
You did the right thing reporting this, Latka.
Thank you very much.
Okay, now get your foreign butt back to work.
Okay.
You know, because I can only be pushed so far.
Right, right.
Uh, excuse me.
Who's in charge here?
I am, ma'am.
I'm Louis de Palma.
Well, how do you do?
I'm looking for Alex Rieger.
Well, you came to the right place.
If there's one thing that I will not tolerate that is my drivers harassing the people of this city, especially an attractive lady like yourself.
Where did he grab you?
You don't understand.
He's my brother.
That makes you Alex's sister.
We couldn't help but overhear.
I didn't know Alex had a sister.
Alex never did talk much about his family.
I'm Charlotte Rieger.
We're all his friends.
This is Elaine Nardo and I'm Mr. Tony Banta.
And you can meet Mr. Bobby Wheeler momentarily.
But, right now, I believe he's in the can.
I'm looking forward to it.
Hey, Bob Hey, Bob this is Charlotte Rieger, Alex's sister.
This is the guy I was telling you about-- Bobby Wheeler.
Hi.
Oh, and this is Latka Gravas.
Oh, never mind him.
How do you do?
Hello.
You are a very pretty lady.
In my country, we have a saying:  Oh!
Oh!
You know Latka's language?
Yes.
I'm multilingual.
I spent several years in Europe.
Okay.
Interesting person.
Too bad his grammar is so poor.
Latka's grammar's bad?
Yes.
He's from the lower class.
My guess would be his family herded swine.
My guess is they dated them.
Why don't we sit down, okay?
Are you a New Yorker, Miss Rieger?
Not anymore.
I live in East Hampton.
To me, New York is just a quiet rainy yesterday.
You said it.
Well, um I was in Manhattan this evening.
I was at a fund-raising dinner, but I was called away.
Oh!
What are you raising funds for?
Starving something.
Do you expect Alex soon?
I'll tell you He should be in momentarily.
Would you care to wait in my office?
I'd rather be the only woman on a Greek freighter.
I wanted very much to talk to Alex, but I'm afraid I just can't wait.
Well, I can take a message.
I wanted to tell him myself.
Uh, you see, uh, my our father had a heart attack.
Is he all right?
His condition is stabilized now.
He's over at New York Hospital.
Let me give you the room number.
Well, Alex should be here any second, and I'm sure he'll go right over there.
It was nice meeting you all.
I wonder what "uh, huh-huh, huh-huh" means.
Poor Alex.
Yeah.
Geez.
When he hears this, he's going to be in no shape to drive tonight He sure isn't.
so don't tell him till morning.
Man, the traffic out there is unbelievable tonight.
Hello, everybody.
Hey, listen, Louie, Louie, I'm ready to go, as soon as you check me out.
Let's go!
Uh, Alex, your sister was here.
Huh?
Charlotte?
Really?
Right?
Well, where'd she go?
Alex, I'm really sorry.
Your father had a heart attack.
He's in the New York Hospital, and here's the room number.
Come on, Louie, I want to get on the road.
Alex, your father had I heard you, Elaine.
Thanks.
Come on, Louie, let me get on the road here.
Hey, Alex Huh?
Uh, look, let me explain something.
My father and I are not close.
In fact, we haven't talked to each other in almost 30 years.
Look, if the situation was reversed, he wouldn't be coming to see me.
Hey, hey, hey.
hardware store?
You happen to know where my other screwdriver, you know what I mean?
All right!
Cut it out!
Knock it off!
Knock it off!
you know?
Knock it off!
You guys shouldn't be fighting.
You're like brothers.
You're both from countries you have to take pills for.
Now, get back to work!
Oh, not you.
You.
Hello.
Hi, everybody.
Oh, Alex um, we've been talking it over, and, uh we're sorry about last night.
Yeah, uh, hey, we didn't mean to pressure you, you know, buddy?
All right.
It's your business, Alex.
Right, so, uh, if you don't want to talk about it with us, well, we love you enough to understand.
Thanks a lot, guys.
You mean you don't?
I don't want to say anything because I haven't got anything to say.
Alex, can I speak to you?
Uh, what?
Louie, what?
Look, you've done me a couple of favors in the past and so I feel like I owe you one, so if you want to talk about this problem man-to-man No, thanks, Louie.
Okay, I understand, but we're even now.
Right.
Look, everybody, I appreciate you trying to help me, but there's absolutely no Alex?
Alex?
What?
Eh, you know, in my country, we have a saying: "Your father, he may beat you, "your father, he may curse you your father, he may take your last bit of meat".
Go on.
That's all.
You mean you mean, that's the whole saying?
Yeah, it's a small country.
Thanks, Latka.
Alex Oh.
Charlotte.
How's, uh?
How is, uh?
His condition is the same; he's still unconscious but the doctor said he may come around.
Maybe we can talk to him this afternoon.
Charlotte Listen, the doctor was concerned.
Alex, Dad is not a young man.
I am not going to the hospital.
I expected you to say that and I'm prepared to deal with it.
I'm going to change your mind.
Now, Charlotte, don't start.
I am not going to leave here until you agree to come to the hospital.
I'm not going!
You know, we haven't seen each other for the past couple of years, Alex.
Maybe you've forgotten just how determined and willful I can be.
Whoo!
Just the way I like 'em.
Is there a place that we could be alone?
Or, at least, safe?
If we haven't got anything to say, we don't need a place to say it.
You can use Latka's tool room.
Elaine!
Through that door.
Come along.
No, Charlotte!
Now, look, Charlotte, if you want to chat socially, fine, but I'm not going into that tool room to talk about Joe.
Nah!
No way!
Alex, do you remember when we were kids and I wanted to do something and you didn't want to do it, how I could persuade you to change your mind with that little ploy I used to use?
Aw, come on.
You don't think that would work now, do you?
All right.
Let's talk.
What'd she used to do?
She used to beat the heck out of me.
Don't shoot.
I'll talk.
Huh?
Oh, Alex.
Oh, abi deeba suboflay.
Abi deebo subo flee.
Oh, suboflee.
Suboflee.
Suboflee.
Me?
Rapo.
Ah, okay, I will take my things.
Aruskala.
Thanks.
Abi deebo suboflee.
Abi deebo suboflee.
Suboflee.
Gee, thanks, Latka.
Thank you.
Thank you both.
Alex Listen, Alex, if you don't see our father today, you may never get the chance to see him again.
Are you prepared for that?
Probably not.
But I've lived with a lot of things I'm not prepared to live with.
Do you know what I was thinking of on the way over here?
I was thinking of Scheherazade.
I'm glad you didn't make me guess.
The cat we had when we were children.
Don't you remember?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We had a terrible argument over that name, I remember.
I wanted to name her something silly, like Taffy.
Thank God calmer heads prevailed.
Do you remember what happened when Scheherazade passed away?
She got run over.
Yes, while you were away at camp.
And when we told you, you were very distraught.
And do you know what bothered you the most?
That you weren't there when it happened.
You didn't get a chance to say goodbye to that little animal you loved.
Yeah, she was a great cat.
The only cat I ever knew that could actually fetch.
Remember when I used to roll the little ball for her, Alex she used to run I'm not here to talk about that stupid cat.
Tell me what could our father have done, that you could possibly refuse "Our father"?
Define "father" for me, would you?
Now, come on, you know as well as I do.
After he left, we were on lousy welfare, while he was earning And now I'm supposed to go to the hospital just because he's had a heart attack, and have a scene with him that'll be a lie for both of us.
You cannot stay this mad for so long, Alex!
No, no, no, no, look, I'm not mad.
I just want to get the facts straight.
You know, I remember all those times coming home from school, when our mother was working, and finding him there with another woman!
He said, "This is your aunt.
Don't tell your mother".
I know.
He was my father, too, you remember.
I was very well aware of his indiscretions.
I was just about 11 when I found out he was fooling around.
They asked me to write an essay, in school, on my father's favorite hobby.
I said he collected stamps.
Cheap stamps.
Cheap, dirty stamps.
Yeah.
Right.
All right, all right.
It's not so easy for me to forget that.
But I try.
Why can't you?
Oh, come on, Charlotte!
It was very different with you.
He had an entirely different relationship with you.
You were his darling little daughter-- hmph!
I remember he even paid for your tuition one year.
Oh, yes, and on your 21st birthday, he gave you a very special gift.
A little something.
Yeah, yeah, what was it?
A car.
Ah.
Okay, maybe I did have it a little better than you.
It doesn't change the fact he stayed away from me just as much as he stayed away from you, and I forgave him, and so did Mama.
He didn't even come to her funeral!
He was there, Alex.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
He was outside the cemetery gate.
I always thought it was a coincidence.
He was there.
He brought a date!
He needed emotional support.
She was wearing toreador pants!
I understand your bitterness.
I am not bitter!
I understand your anger.
I am not angry!
Your pique?
I'm piqued as hell!
Alex, your father may be dying.
You must go!
I'm going to beg!
No, Charlotte, don't beg.
I am!
I'm gonna beg!
Charlotte, please don't beg.
I'm begging!
Please go.
You beg bad.
Just see him.
Look at him.
Say, "Hello, I'm sorry you're dying.
I'll see you around".
If you go and it doesn't work, so?
But if you don't go, and he dies, you're going to regret it, Alex.
You, not him.
You!
You're the loser, Alex!
You  I wish they had sent me to college.
Then I'd have something to argue with.
Oh, Miss Stallworth.
Oh, hello.
I came back to see how your father was doing.
This is my brother Alex.
This is Miss Stallworth.
She was on the scene of the accident.
Oh, uh, how do you do?
She gave Daddy mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before the ambulance came.
I hope he's gonna be okay.
Well, the doctor said he's conscious.
We're going to see him now.
Uh, uh, Miss Stallworth, where was he when it happened?
Well, uh, he was waiting on the subway platform next to me.
Oh?
Well, tell me, was he overexerting himself in some way?
I mean, was he running to catch a train or something?
Well, as a matter of fact he was goosing me.
Talk about going with your boots on.
I screamed and it shocked him so, he just collapsed.
I really feel responsible, you know, screaming like that.
Oh, no.
No, no.
No, don't, don't, don't.
He must've realized the risks he was taking.
Listen, Miss Stallworth I just want to ask you Shall we, Alex?
Excuse us, please.
I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
Look, okay, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to have to be alone.
All right.
Wh-Wh-Wh-What am I gonna say?
Tell him a few of the things that made him a good father.
Hello.
It's me, Alex.
Alex?
Yeah.
Listen, uh, I, um I'm sorry to see you this way.
Thank you.
I'm a little weak.
Yeah, listen, just relax, okay?
Just listen, all right?
Um Boy, you've gotten so old.
Well, I guess I've aged too, huh?
Look, uh, Charlotte insisted that I come here today.
She, um she wanted me to say, um I'm not sure what she wanted me to say, uh Well, she thought it would be a good idea if I took this opportunity to tell you some of the terrific things that you've done for me.
And, um, although it has been a very long time, some of them really stick out, you know.
Like, uh uh Yeah, I remember being really thirsty one night and you just marched right in there with a glass of water.
You didn't even complain.
I think you put a couple of ice cubes in it too.
You even took the glass back.
And you kissed charlotte good night.
Yeah, that was great.
Seeing all that affection.
And there were other times too.
Uh like, um you took an interest in my school, I remember.
Yeah, I remember one time, in particular, you asked me what grade I was in.
And I was such a punk kid, I didn't even answer you.
It was fifth grade, Dad.
Well, look, anyway, uh whatever you did or you didn't do, it got me here.
Hey, you know something?
Uh even though we haven't spoken in 30 years, and I've never tried to get in touch with you, it has made a difference, your being in this world for me.
Look, I lied, um Charlotte didn't force me to come here.
I came because I wanted to.
: No, no, I came because I had to.
No, I came because you're my father.
You're my father.
Oh, damn it, you're my father.
Alex?
Hi, Dad.
Oh, my God!
Oh, geez, I'm sorry.
Hope I haven't screwed things up here.
He a friend of yours?
Well, he is now.
Hey, uh you two don't even look alike.
How did I make the mistake?
It has been a while.
Yeah.
I, um are you supposed to be up?
Probably not.
I thought you were in critical condition.
Really?
I feel fine.
Yeah?
I, uh I came here to see how you were, and, uh this gentleman and I had a really terrific conversation.
Boy, do I feel stupid right now.
I mean, I made a big speech to him about how I felt about him and me.
You and me.
What did you say?
Well, it was kind of personal.
I don't know.
Um Listen, I, uh Well, uh take it easy.
You too.
Right.
Right.
Well, um so long.
So long.
Alex.
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
¿Que pasa, que pasa, que pasa?
Take a hike, all right?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Come on!
It's quittin' time.
Let's go home.
Take it easy, huh?
Okay, bye-bye.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hey  Drinks for everybody.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
In our little group.
Tony won tonight?
Does this look like the face of a loser?
Well, in that case, the first pitcher's on me.
Hey, thanks, Tom.
Oh, that's great.
Oh, boy, did that guy go down hard.
That sucker hit the canvas like a sack of cement.
Hey, you know, I'll tell you, I was worried for a minute.
You never want to see anybody get hurt, you know.
Ah Hey, you really gave it to him good, huh, Tony?
It was a weird thing, Tommy.
The guy was climbing into the ring, he trips, falls down and knocks himself cold.
Tony won by default.
You mean, that's what you're celebrating?
I had to make it through the same ropes.
That'll be three bucks.
Hey, look.
There's Reverend Jim.
Oh, yeah.
The guy who performed Latka's wedding ceremony.
Hey, Reverend Jim!
Hey, how you doing, buddy?
Fine, fine.
Uh, how you doing?
Oh, great, great.
You, uh, remember us?
Uh, nope.
Jeez, it was nice chatting with you.
Latka!
Where have you been?
I thought you were coming to my fight.
Latka, Latka, Latka, calm down.
Go slowly.
All right.
I was going to go to your fight but I take the wrong subway and I end up in a place called, uh how do you say, uh, Har Harlem.
Harlem?
So I went walking around, uh, lost, and I go into the bar, and I tell everyone I am looking for a fight.
Right.
Uh did you find one?
Well, lots of people offered to help.
So uh, I sit down and drink with them and you know, they make mistake.
They think I am their brother.
So so they teach me word new words and lots of songs, and we all have a good time.
Mm-hmm.
So how was your fight?
I won!
Oh, you are a bad dude.
Sit down, Latka.
When are they going to clean those bathrooms?
You were in the kitchen.
Thank goodness.
Wait a minute-- you marry me.
Uh, believe me, it would never work out.
No, no, no, no.
You performed the wedding ceremony.
Yeah, yeah.
Don't you remember?
Eight months ago, Latka had to get married to stay in the country.
You performed the ceremony at the Sunshine Garage.
Oh, yeah.
I thought I dreamed that.
Maybe I'm dreaming this.
Hey, Tommy, how about another glass, okay?
You're up.
So how's the Church of the Peaceful doing?
Not so good.
After the draft ended, I lost my flock.
Well, have you performed any other wedding ceremonies?
Let's see, I, uh married two people stark naked in the woods.
You mean the whole wedding party was nude?
No, just me.
They, uh changed their minds at the last minute and forgot to tell me.
Thanks for the beer.
Yeah.
Well, we'll see you around.
Oh, boy.
Oh, the poor guy.
You know, in-in my country we have an expression:  What does it mean?
Uh "Poor guy".
You know, call me crazy, but I happen to like the guy.
and I'm going to go see how he's doing.
You're crazy.
You're crazy, crazy.
Hey, uh, Jim.
Yo!
Listen, my friends and I, we were wondering if you'd like to come over and join us.
Well, what did you decide?
Well, we-we, uh we thought that-that you might like to?
Okeydoke.
Of course, I can only stay for five or six.
So how you doing, Jim?
Fine, fine.
Uh, who are you folks again?
You marry me.
In the garage.
Oh, yeah.
Jim, uh, would you mind if I asked you a personal question?
Well, I can take it, if you can.
No, no, no, not that personal.
Um, did you ever think about doing something with your life?
You know, like getting a job?
As a matter of fact, I have.
I've often thought I'd make a good pharmacist.
A pharmacist?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, if you're serious then you have to go to school, take a lot of chemistry Oh, I've taken a lot of chemistry.
You know, this has been a very long day for me so I must boogie on home now.
Boogie down, Latka.
Boogie down.
Okay.
Good-bye.
Thanks for dropping by.
See you.
* Get on up * Get on the scene * I feel like a sex machine.
Last call.
I got to close it up.
Hey, Tom, another round.
Hey, uh will you guys let me buy?
Yeah!
Sure!
Why not?
Any of this currency?
Next time.
Yeah, I know.
I'll get it.
Jim, I guess what we're trying to say is that we'd like to help you.
Hey, Elaine, would you leave him alone?
He's not asking anything from anybody.
Besides, it's not like our lives are in such great shape.
Yeah, but I just can't believe he's happy this way.
You know, getting high all the time.
Hey no.
Everything I take is by doctor's prescription-- everything.
Though finding the right doctor can be difficult.
Jim, please don't be offended by what I'm about to say, but don't you ever feel like you're wasting your life?
Me?
No, no.
I have function in life.
I-I stand for something.
Not everybody stands for something, but I do.
I am the living embodiment of the '60s.
Everything that came along, I went with.
Even if I didn't know what it was, I went with it.
I did some drugs not nearly so many as you probably think I did.
How many drugs do you think I did?
Mmm a lot.
Wow!
Right on the nose!
But I did a lot of all the other stuff, too.
I spent a year of my life making a macramé couch.
I went to all the big events.
I was at Woodstock.
Oh, yeah?
You went to Woodstock?
Yeah.
Half a million people.
Hey, you know, if I hadn't been there there would only have been Lucky thing for them I went.
All of them groovin' on Hendrix, Sly, Joni, and The Who.
All of us gathered together in peace and joy.
I'd like to see them try that with disco.
I did it all.
I wore flowers in my hair meditated for hours on end chanted I was finding God all over the place.
He kept ditching me.
I marched and protested against that crummy war.
Is that so?
Pardon me?
Hey, hey, hey, Tony.
No, I got something to say, Alex.
You know, the only reason why guys like you got to stay home, protest, and get loaded because guys like me were over in 'Nam doing your fighting for you.
What do you say to that?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
But you got to understand my position.
I thought I was on my way to Nirvana.
All I ended up with was recurring flashbacks of the original Mouseketeers hatching out of seedpods.
Boy, time flies.
Yeah.
I'm sleeping with the lights on tonight.
So, Jim, uh, take it easy, old man, and, uh okay.
Good night, Tony.
Hey, guys.
Let's get him a job.
Let's do that.
Doing what?
What, are you kidding?
What kind of training could he possibly have?
None.
What kind of skills could he possibly have?
None.
What kind of job can we possibly get him?
Cabdriver.
Cabdriver.
Cabdriver.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
How?
Yeah?
Now I'm telling you, Jim, you drive in the test like you just drove now and you'll do fine.
So, Jim you coming along?
Well, I'm a little confused about something.
Am I coming or going?
Come on, I'll introduce you to your future boss, all right?
Might as well get this over with, huh?
Hey, Jim, if you can handle this, the rest of reality is a piece of cake, believe me.
LOUIE : Okay, listen up here!
Simpkin, 401.
Petrelli, 622.
Latka, I'm still waiting on that cab.
I could have built a new one by now.
I'm getting done, bro.
Excuse me, Louie.
You remember Reverend Jim.
Howdy.
Get him out.
I mean it, Nardo.
Get him out of here.
He's a flake.
All right, come on now, listen.
Losers bookings are down this week.
I know guys pulling rickshas that could do better.
We got to get Louie to agree to this.
Well, maybe we can get him on a shift that Louie he won't have to deal with Louie.
Maybe he could start in another company and, uh, you know, once he breaks in Hey, what was that?
Uh what was what?
You just put something in Louie's coffee.
What was that?
It was either a tranquilizer or a Chiclet.
Jim!
Jim, that's stupid!
Hey, Wheeler!
Get your mitts off my cup.
Yeah, but Louie Get out of here.
Get your own coffee.
Yeah?

You were giving them hell, Louie.
Oh, yeah.
Krubnik, 301!
Try something new tonight, like making money.
Hendy, 338!

Hey, uh give me a little help on this one.
You forgot your last name?
I've been busy.
Well, what was your father's name?
Uh, Ignatowski.
Well, maybe that's your name, too.
You know, I think you're right.
Good, good.
"Eyes".
No, don't put two.
Oh.
They mean color, don't they?
Yep.
What color are my eyes?
Elaine, you want to take a stab at this one?
Hmm well, you can rule out white.

Uh, let's see.
Uh "Height".
Oh, about, um about five ten?
Oh, good.
Yeah, good.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Uh Ow.
"Weight".
Weight, uh now this is a very relative question.
I mean, if I were in space I'd be weightless.
You are in space.
Jim, they mean Earth weight.
Oh.
Whew.
This is the most reading I've done in years.
My brown eyes hurt.
Here, here, let me help you out, okay?
All right.
Phew!
Um "Have you ever experienced "loss of consciousness, hallucinations, "dizzy spells, convulsive disorders, fainting, or periods of loss of memory"?
Well, hasn't everyone?
Put "No".
Um "Mental illness or narcotic addiction"?
That's a tough choice.
Just put "No".
Okay, that's it.
You're ready for the test.
I thought this was the test.
No, no, no, this is the application.
Oh, man!
The day is getting rougher and rougher.
I'm expecting the Mouseketeers any second now.
I'd be just like them.
I think that Cubby's got it in for me.
Jim, really, it's going to be okay.
We'll just take your application up to the counter and then they'll give you the test, okay?
Okay.
Do they serve beer over there?
No.
You're going to need this.
Yeah.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
This is a joke.
What are you worried about?
What am I worried about?
Two things-- That they won't issue him a license to drive in this city and that they will.
Go get them.
He's going to do it.
I know he's going to do it.
Psst What does a yellow light mean?
Slow down.
Okay.
What does a yellow light mean?
Slow down.
Okay.
What does a yellow light mean?
Slow down!
What does a yellow light mean?
!
I got to admit, I never thought you'd pass.
The examiner said I did real well.
I didn't hit hardly anything.
Hey, Jeff?
Yeah?
Give this man a key.
Okay.
And an envelope.
Jim, I'd like to present you with the keys to Cab 605 and your first envelope.
I never been good at speeches, but this is one of the great moments of my life.
I've never felt closer to a group of people, not even in the portable johns at Woodstock.
Thanks, everybody.
Well, uh, I'm off.
Oh, I'd like to request the honor of being your first passenger.
Well, hop in.
Okay.
Well, thank you.
Where are you headed?
Uptown cabby.
That'll be 90 cents.
Night, Mr. Walters.

Time to split up the old booty.
Yeah.
How much money did you get today?
Eh, not too much.
Two pennies, a dime and a Canadian quarter?
Yup, that's right.
You mean to tell me that that's all the money you got out of these cabs?
That's all.
You know, Latka, if you were anybody else, I'd think you're trying to pull a fast one on me.
But since it's you, empty your pockets.

Oh oh.
So y-you recognize his name.
Hey, Elaine.
Hi, guys.
Well, well, well.
Where you been?
We ain't seen much of you lately.
Oh, I know.
I've been spending every spare minute I have down at the gallery, you know, working on the new exhibit.
I feel bad.
I-I feel like I've been neglecting you guys.
Well, you have.
So, uh, so let's catch up, you know.
Okay, hey, sit down.
Oh, okay.
So, so what's been happening?
Uh, uh, Tony, how'd that fight with Gomez go?
Oh, he knocked me out in the second round.
Oh.
And, uh, hey, Bobby, weren't you working on some, uh, experimental play?
Yeah, they closed it.
Oh.
What have you been doing, Alex?
Well, I went to a bad play and a short fight.
Well, uh, how about if we, uh, we just play a round, you know, and, uh Yeah, let's do that.
Come on.
All right, all right.
It'll give me time to relax and, uh, eat my lunch, and balance my checkbook and, uh, go through my mail.
Yeah, everyone needs to loaf once in awhile.
So, Elaine, you've been spending a lot of time down at the gallery, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Well, see, uh, I-I'm in charge of this new exhibit, and it's my first time.
It's taking an enormous amount of work, but, but if it goes well at the opening on Saturday, it could really give my career a boost.
From nowhere to almost somewhere.
Ooh Ms. Nardo's here.
Would you care to take a stroll over to my cage and, uh, pick up your messages?
Oh, yeah, okay.
Well, uh, I'll-I'll be right back, okay?
Hey, I'm in.
Okay.
Nardo, messages have been coming in in droves for you.
I got 11 of them.
Count 'em, 11.
I'm sorry, Louie.
Well, here's $11.
Money, Nardo?
Let's not sully our relationship.
You make me feel so tawdry.
Okay, uh, so what do you want?
How about coming up to my place tonight, we'll go crazy?
Here's your money, creep.
I'm wearing her down.
Well, finally.
Well, here we go.
Uh, listen, I just got a couple of quick calls to make, and I'll be right back, okay?
No, no, no.
I said I'd play, so I'm going to.
Yeah, besides I got to eat my lunch.
Oh, Ms. Nardo, it's for you.
: She'll be right there.
Probably the gallery.
You in?
Yeah, yeah, I'm in.
Uh, would somebody get me some coffee?
It's going to be a long day.
All right.
Hello.
Gee, Elaine sure is busy.
Yeah, well, I can relate to that.
You know, I mean, I got a hectic schedule, too.
You know, driving a cab, trying to make it as an actor Oh, my God!
That reminds me.
I have an audition today.
To-Tony, Tony, you got the time?
Oh, it's 8:30.
That means I have to be ready in less than five hours.
It never ends.
You know, my life can be hectic, too.
Do you realize that if this was tomorrow, I'd have to be in the gym in 15 minutes.
Oh, Tony, Tony, we got to come up for air sometime.
I hear you.
Is that my coffee?
Yeah, wait a minute.
How many cups have you already had today?
Three.
Okay.
I lied, I had eight.
I lied, that's hot chocolate.
Elaine, can I talk to you for a minute?
Uh, yeah, sure.
Sit down, please.
Uh, what's on your mind?
I'm worried about you.
Aw.
No "aw," I'm really worried about you.
I know, I worry about you too sometimes.
We're not talking about me.
I'm wonderful.
Yeah, you are.
Please, Elaine, are you okay?
I mean, the way you've been running Oh, Alex, I know what you're going to say.
You're worried about me because of the way I've been running around, and I seem to be going in 20 different directions all at once, and, uh, you think it's bad for me and kind of dangerous.
And, uh, I think you're blowing things way, way out of proportion, but okay, okay.
I promise you that as soon as everything slows down and I have taken care of everything that's hanging over my head at this moment, I am going to take a nice, long, three-week bath.
And I know I talk too much and thanks.
I didn't mean to lecture.
Surprise, surprise.
It's for her nibs.
I'm sorry, guys.
Hello.
We're never going to get this game over with.
Good hand, huh?
What do you mean?
Well, you're a little impatient, huh?
Oh, no, it's just that I don't think that's the way you should play poker, that's all.
Oh, sure, Tony.
Listen, uh, I-I'll be just a second, okay?
Take your time.
Listen, that gallery is a mad house.
I got to go.
Oh, man.
No, no, listen.
I'm going to finish this hand.
Gin.
Listen, the show opens Saturday, 7:00, and you are all invited-- bye.
Gin?
Boy, did she catch me with points.
Hi, Elaine.
Oh, Fran-- uh, these are very important buyers.
Hello there.
Oh, I am so glad to see you guys.
Friendly faces, you know?
How come you're so early?
Well, we were going to eat at Mario's first but Alex said you had food, so you know.
We got here fast, before any freeloaders scarfed it up.
Yeah, well, uh, you can have anything you see.
But, uh, hey, guys, remember last time.
I mean, don't go stuffing food in your pockets.
She should have told me that before I lined them with tin foil.
Elaine, uh, who's she?
Oh, that's, uh Fran Strickland.
She's one of our best artists.
Hey, Elaine, I'll show you an artist.
So how's it going?
Well, the paintings got lost, the food came late Jason's ant colony broke, there are ants all over my house, and the exterminator can't come until tomorrow.
And you?
Well, uh, I'm sort of Ashtrays, yes.
Just the word I was looking for.
I, uh I like these, uh Are they yours?
Yes.
I love these.
Elaine, this is a great exhibit.
Oh, thanks.
Uh, what do you like best?
I don't know.
What do you call this?
Elaine!
Yeah?
We have to talk.
Uh, I'll be over there in a second, okay, Phillip?
I-I'm taking my paintings down.
What?
Well, I rushed them, and it shows.
Oh, no, no, um, Phillip.
These, these paintings, they're wonderful.
No, no, they're not ready.
I'm sorry, I can't let them be seen.
No, Phillip!
I mean, come on, be reasonable.
Uh, Alex, uh, Phillip wants his paintings down.
Do they look finished to you?
They're great.
Terrific.
I think this one could use more brown.
That does it.
No, Phillip.
Tony, how could you do this to me?
!
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine.
Everything's okay.
It's okay.
Phillip!
Oh, no.
Look, maybe it's better this way.
Who says an art gallery has to have paintings all over the walls?
Alex, I think you better take me out of here pretty fast.
Why?
Excuse me, Elaine.
What do you want?
No, no, no.
Alex, uh, this is one of the owners.
Oh, sorry.
H-how do you do?
Hi.
Elaine, it's the champagne.
Uh, what about it?
Well, it's flat, and several people have noticed.
Well, wha-what do you want me to do about it?
Well, I don't know, but, I mean, people like bubbles in their champagne.
I know I do.
Do you see any bubbles?
You want bubbles?
I guess that's what I should expect from a cabdriver.
No, you know what you can expect from a cabdriver?
Low bridge!
Hey!
What's the matter with that guy?
Yeah, you idiot.
Would you just relax?
Me relax?
You relax.
We'll both relax, okay?
Elaine, I think you need to see someone.
What do you mean?
I am not going to see a psychiatrist.
Why not?
Hah, no.
You think needing help is a sign of weakness?
Yeah.
There's nothing wrong with needing a little help once in a while.
Stop trying to be so tough.
Hey, I am a single parent responsible for two small children.
Man, I got to be tough.
Okay.
Okay.
Now, what about your responsibility to those two small children?
What's gonna happen to them?
Hmm?
Now, I'm no psychiatrist, but I can tell a manic-depressive, Down syndrome when I see one.
Alex, I can't see a psychiatrist.
Why not?
What about the money?
So you'll go to a clinic where they charge you according to what you earn.
Now, don't make money the issue.
You're scared.
Of what?
You're scared that you're gonna find out you're just as fragile and needy as all the rest of us.
Alex, I don't need a psychiatrist.
Yeah.
Okay, okay, the pressure's been getting to me.
I-I'd be stupid not to admit that now, but I don't need to see a psychiatrist.
I don't know.
Maybe I need an arm around me once in awhile.
Oh  Or a pat on the head.
Or a kiss.
Alex, don't pull away from me.
I'm not pulling away from you, Elaine.
Now, sometimes people get upset, and instead of dealing with their problems, they try to run from them, like with drinking and eating and, uh, flirting with enormously attractive men.
Alex, I don't think you should kid around about this.
What?
I mean, come on, you and I have been pretty close, and we have cared about each other for some time now.
I mean, you can't tell me that, uh, getting closer has never crossed your mind.
Well, as a matter of fact, uh, it hasn't kept me awake nights, no.
It's never crossed your mind?
Once.
When?
The day you were that red and white striped dress.
It's crossed my mind once.
When?
Now.
N Oh.
Oh.
Alex, um, be honest with me.
What are you afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
Elaine, Elaine, uh, look, I-I'm just afraid that you're doing this, maybe unconsciously, because you just don't want to deal with the fact that you might need some help right now, that's all.
Oh, I love it when a man tells me I'm unconsciously avoiding therapy.
Elaine, Elaine, Elaine.
Stop giving me a hard time, okay?
I mean, look, uh, uh, it's not as if part of me doesn't want to uh uh, doesn't want to I'm going to wait it out till you finish that.
No, no, no.
No, no.
I'm just worried about the fact that we have a great friendship, a-a-and Oh, Alex, I'm a very busy woman.
I've got two jobs and two kids.
Yes or no?
No.
Ah Elaine, damn it, it-it just wouldn't be right.
I-I wouldn't feel right.
Look, you-you've been you've been upset for weeks now.
You've got to see someone.
Okay, okay.
Boy, if you feel that strongly about it I'm going to go.
I mean, I think it's a waste of time, but I'm gonna go just to prove that you're wrong.
Fine.
Fine.
Take me home.
Fine.
Hey, but if you do go to a psychiatrist and he gives us the permission to, um I'll take you home now.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Dr. Bernard Collins.
Elaine Nardo.
Nice to know you.
Nice to meet you.
What do you think?
What, uh?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, come on.
I know you're an art connoisseur.
What's your opinion?
Well, uh, I hope you don't mind my saying this, but, uh, it stinks.
You didn't pay too much for it, did you?
Very little.
I painted it.
Oh!
I'm sorry, I didn't Oh, no, you're right.
It's terrible.
Oh.
I sometimes use the painting to test my patients' honesty.
Boy, are you honest.
Uh, uh, don't you sort of like the eyes?
Yeah, I like the eyes.
Honest but kind.
Have a seat.
Okay.
Could you move a little closer?
I think it's a toll call over there.
: Gee, uh, I'm sorry.
I just didn't think I had to get all the way in the room.
This is going to be so easy for you, like an hour off.
Good.
Yeah, um, actually, there's nothing wrong with me.
I'm only here to prove to a certain person that I'm okay.
I see.
So, um, if you don't mind, could you sign this note?
"I have examined Elaine Nardo psychologically, and find her in no need of treatment whatsoever".
Nice note.
I especially like the flower in the corner.
So would you sign it?
Now?
Well, uh, you can ask me a few questions first, but, uh, it's not absolutely necessary.
Well, I do have an hour to kill.
And if you leave, I'll have to read this article about what rats did at the University of Wisconsin.
Unbelievable.
Well, uh, sure, if you don't mind wasting your time.
Might be fun.
Yeah.
I never did anything like this before.
So so, uh, go ahead, throw a few ink blots at me.
You want to hear my dreams?
No?
Uh, do you want me to, uh, uh, scream or-or pound a pillow?
Admit I'm mad at my mother or my kids?
Look, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but all those therapies, they're just not for me.
What is?
Well, it's something kind of radical.
What's it called?
Talking.
Look, I know this is new for you.
J-Just try and relax, huh?
Sit down.
Please.
And tell me about yourself.
Well, wha-what do you want to know?
Anything-- I never met you before.
Who are you?
Tell me a typical Elaine Nardo day.
Well, uh, okay.
Well, you see, I got this sort of schedule.
I'm very organized.
A sure sign of mental health, right?
Right.
So, uh, um, okay, this is what I do.
I-I, I get up, and I get the kids ready for school, right, and then I drop them off at school.
And I run my errands or I do laundry, and I prepare supper.
And then I go to the gallery, and I work for four hours.
Then I pick up the kids, and then we kind of spend some time together.
You know, I help them with their homework or I give them a bath or whatever, and I make supper.
And then when the baby-sitter comes, I go to the garage and take out a cab and drive all night.
And, uh, and that's all.
Wow.
I know it sounds like a lot, but, you know, once you get How long have you been doing this?
A little over a year.
Wow.
No, I-I-I know it sounds a bit much, but, uh, it's not all work.
You see, every day I make sure that I set aside a certain amount of time just to pamper myself.
I bet all of five minutes.
Oh, sometimes twice that.
Wow.
Look, you don't have to tell me I'm busy.
See, I know I'm busy, but, uh but what choice have I got?
See, I can't give up the gallery, because, uh, I really love it there, and, and I'm just starting to grow.
And, uh, I can't give up the garage, either, 'cause I need the money.
So, uh, I guess I'll just have to give up the kids.
Wow.
Look, no more "wows," okay?
Look, I don't need anybody's help.
I'm the kind of person that other people come to for help.
So I must be pretty solid, right?
I mean, the kids come to me and, and the guys.
Yeah, it gets to be a bit much, you know, uh I-I mean, you don't know what it's like, everybody coming to you with their problems.
And, and sometimes I'll admit that I, I feel like getting in my cab, you know, and and just driving and driving and driving and, and going someplace where nobody knows me and, and nobody wants anything from me, and 'Cause I just I just get so tired : of being a grownup, you know?
And I've been doing it since I was eight years old, 'cause I had like three little brothers, you know, and they used to come to me all the time.
And, you know, sometimes sometimes I think I just can't go on another day.
Oh, God, the nights aren't easy.
Oh, God, you must think I'm in bad shape.
No, not really.
Good, then sign the note.
Hey, Elaine.
Hi.
I haven't seen you in a while.
Huh, ever since you've been, uh, going to the psychiatrist-- what was it, two weeks, huh?
Yeah.
How've you been doing, huh?
Well, uh, i-i-it's, uh, kind of hard to tell.
I've only seen him ten times.
Oh?
But I like him.
As a matter of fact, I'm late for an appointment right now.
Oh.
But, uh, but I've been missing you, and, uh, I wanted to talk.
Yeah, sure, sure.
This is kind of hard for me.
Ha!
Let me start.
Nice dress.
: Thanks.
Um, Alex, uh Yeah?
Do you remember the conversation we had that night in the cab?
Uh, you mean, when you said, uh, "Alex, be honest with me.
What are you afraid of"?
And I said, "I'm afraid you're just doing this maybe unconsciously "because you don't want to deal with the fact that, uh, you need help right now".
And you said, "I love it when a man accuses me of unconsciously avoiding therapy".
And then I said, "Don't give me a hard time.
It's not like part of me doesn't want to"?
Yeah.
Vaguely.
Well, uh, I just wanted to tell you that you were right, that, that it was my way of, uh, avoiding my problems, and that, and that this wouldn't be the right time to get involved in a physical relationship.
And I want to thank you for, for realizing that.
Thanks.
Hey, listen, I'm just glad that one of us had the sense to stop before we did something that we would have both remembered fondly for the rest of our lives.
Oh, thanks again.
Ciao.
Bye.
Hi, Latka.
Oh, Elaine Uh, I heard you are seeing a podiatrist.
You know, I am I seeing one, too.
Oh, no, no, no, Latka.
I'm seeing a psychiatrist.
A-A podiatrist is a doctor that takes care of your feet.
Oh, so that's that's why.
That's What?
Oh, because I told him I was having bad dreams, so he told me to wear looser shoes.
Oh.
A-And you know, it worked.
Boy, this is a great country.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Here you go, Louie.
I got any messages?
Yeah, right here.
Oh, good.
Here's your buck.
Here you go.
Oh, boy.
Terrific.
Bad news?
I got a commercial.
Uh, Bob, forgive my ignorance, but, uh, I mean, I realize I don't know much about show business, but isn't getting a job supposed to be the good part?
It's just a local commercial for some suntan lotion.
Hey, Alex, this is not what I wanted to do with my life or my career.
I didn't get this job because I'm a good actor.
I got it because I happen to be a fairly great-looking guy who even looks better with a tan.
You sure you're not just being humble?
You know, I'm going to call my agent and tell him I don't do any more junk.
Latka!
Latka!
What?
I got a message for you here.
Oh, okay.
You know the rules.
What?
It'll cost you.
Oh, okay.
Here I go.
What the hell is this?
It's a kebel.
What's a kebel?
Well, it take 270 kebel make a lifnitsch.
What's a lifnitsch?
Eh, 130 lifnitsch make a matta.
Okay, so what's a matta?
I don't know nothing.
What's a matta with you?
I, you know I, you know I-I read it on the bubble gum wrapper.
Shut up or you're fired.
Okay, I'm sorry.
I was just pulling your yaktabe.
That's better.
Thank you very much.
Well, this is the garage, Steve.
This is the dispatcher's cage.
That guy in there?
The dispatcher.
He's mean.
Come on.
Here you go, Lou.
What do you think you're doing, B.B. Brain?
See what I mean?
I was just showing Steve around the garage.
Steve Jensen, Mr. Louie De Palma.
Hi.
Get lost, yokel.
God, I love New York.
Come on, I want you to meet the others.
Hey, guys, this is Steve Jensen.
This is Elaine Nardo.
Hi.
And this is Alex Rieger.
Hi.
Good to see you.
That's Bobby over there on the phone.
Come on, you can sit in my seat.
Hey, I just picked Steve up at the bus station and guess what?
What?
I find out he wants to be an actor.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
So I thought I'd introduce him to Bobby.
You know, he just got into town today.
Uh-huh.
Some luck, huh?
Hmm?
I mean, what are the chances of a guy coming to New York to be an actor and first thing he meets a guy like me, who knows a guy like Bobby, who wants to be an actor too?
What are the chances of that?
At least.
Well, I set him straight.
You really told him, huh?
Well, not exactly.
I had to leave a message.
The guy's never there.
Hey, Bobby, this is Steve Jensen.
He just got into town today, and guess what?
He wants to be an actor.
Oh-oh, yeah?
Yeah.
So I told him I'd introduce you guys.
You know, you could give him some help, some advice.
You want some advice on being an actor, kid?
Forget it.
That's my advice.
It's not worth it.
The only thing you get out of acting is heartache.
It will eat you up, it will spit you out.
It's a dog's life, man.
It stinks.
Does that help at all?
Uh, Steve, Steve you have to forgive Bobby.
He's really not in love with acting right now.
He just got cast in a television commercial.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
You're a professional, then.
Oh, yeah, and this part is really challenging too.
I play the only guy at a party without a tan.
Who cares?
I mean, the point is you're working.
Yeah, I I suppose.
Look, you still want to learn about being an actor?
Yeah.
Fool.
Follow me.
Hey, we're going to split.
See you later, okay?
Thanks.
Have a good time.
Okay.
See you, Steve.
Come on, I'll introduce you to my agent and then you can introduce me to my agent.
Hello, Louie?
What?
I hate to bother you, but your handwriting is bad.
I can't read it.
So what is this word?
Is it "brafla" or "bratla"?
What's the difference?
If it's "brafla," I have to kill a man.
I think it's "bratla".
Oh, good, good.
Now I won't need the rest of the day off.
Hey, Tony, is the side of your face swollen?
Oh, could be.
I had a little accident.
What happened?
I leaned out of the cab to tell this guy he was an idiot and I forgot to roll the window down.
Hey, anybody seen Steve yet today?
No.
I thought he was at your place till he got his own apartment.
Yeah, he is, only he left before I got off of work this morning.
I introduced him to my agent and I was just wondering how it was going.
Oh, that first day must really be rough, huh?
You're telling me.
When those agents and producers start slamming doors in your face, a few hours could seem like a lifetime.
I told him I'd take him out for a drink and talk to him.
I figure he might need it, you know?
Well, uh I guess I got to go.
Hey, Bob.
Yeah?
That commercial Yeah?
Have fun.
Thanks.
I'll try.
See ya.
Bobby?
Yeah?
You're doing a commercial today?
I want you to have this.
Aw.
What is it?
It's goat droppings.
Oh, hey, well, thanks, Latka.
Thanks a lot.
Is this good luck charm in your country?
No.
Then, uh, why are you giving it to me?
I don't want it.
Hey, you know, the way Bob's taking care of Steve, you got to hand it to him.
I know.
Hey, Bobby's a great guy, man.
Before you name a church after him, might I point out one little detail.
What's that?
Wheeler's garbage and you all know it.
Hey, Louie, Louie, why do you dislike Bob so much?
He doesn't respect my leadership.
What are you talking about?
He's like everyone else here.
He fears you.
He pays you bribes.
He hates you.
Don't stick up for him.
You believe this?
Hey, Steve, Bobby's looking for you.
Hey you okay?
I think so.
Hey, are you sure?
I'm okay.
You want to talk about it?
There's not much to say, really.
I got a job.
No kidding?
Bobby's agent sent me on this audition.
I got it!
We open off Broadway in eight weeks!
Congratulations!
Yeah, from me, too.
What's the part?
I'm playing Romeo.
Romeo?
!
In what?
In Romeo and Juliet.
Hey, I heard of that.
You must be some fantastic actor.
I mean, Bobby's been trying for a break like this for years.
Oh, God.
You know, he's right.
Bobby could be shattered by this.
I never thought about that.
Yeah.
So who gets to break the bad news to him?
I'll tell him.
No, that's all right.
We'll tell him.
Why do you get to?
Listen, this is going to be very painful for you guys.
It won't bother me.
In fact, I might even find some way to get a little enjoyment out of it.
Louie, why would anyone go out of his way to deliver awful, depressing news to another human being?
Kicks.
Oh, I see.
Come on, you guys.
You don't know how much this means to me.
It's a dream come true.
Excuse me for saying so, but I think I deserve a break like this.
Louie, you know, you're making a fool of yourself.
I know, and I don't care.
This is a once in a lifetime shot.
All I'm asking is one lousy little favor.
Let me break the bad news to Wheeler.
I'll do it I'll do it in four words.
Now look, Louie I'll do it in three words.
Make it one word.
Is "super-loser" one word?
Louie, stop!
Now, we're going to do it in our own way.
You got it?
Okay, okay.
You got me.
All right.
All right.
You deny me the pleasure of telling him to his face.
Right.
But I can still call him.
Hey, stop that man!
Stop him!
No!
No time for love.
Stop that man!
Louie!
Louie!
Louie!
Get away from him!
All right, I give I give up!
I give up!
I give up.
You promise not to call him?
I won't call him.
He's losing his pants.
Don't you wish.
All right, all right.
Louie!
All right!
I'm not going to ca I won't call him.
Trust my word.
Okay.
Hi.
I'd like to send a singing telegram.
Louie!
Hey, here comes Bobby!
Look easy now.
Everybody act happy for him.
Surprise!
Hey, this is great!
Hey!
You guys are really something else.
We just thought, you know, we'd help you celebrate the commercial.
Oh, thanks.
What's the matter with your face?
Uh, Tony, please.
Well, look at his face.
Hey, I bet you were in on this too, huh?
And after the kind of day you must have had.
Ah, hey, this is really great, you guys.
I don't know what to say.
What's the matter with your face?
Tony!
Tony No!
No, no.
Can you believe they wanted me to do the commercial like this?
I can't believe it.
Oh, boy!
But you know something?
It was really okay, you know?
I mean, I mean, you know, there are times, when even on a crummy commercial, there are times when an actor uses those tools that he has and they all start working for him, and it all comes together, and it's just They couldn't pay me enough to screw up my face like that.
Tony, please.
Bobby, why don't you just wash that side of your face?
I did, I did.
This stuff is going to be here for a while.
I mean, it really works.
I guess I'm gonna have to tell everybody that my father's side of the family comes from Florida.
Yeah, right!
Hey, so, how did it go?
Hey!
I'd like to propose a toast.
Uh, to Bob-- a really fine actor.
A fine, understanding, easy-going, level-headed, roll-with-the-punches kind of guy.
Cheers.
So, uh, how was your first day out, huh?
Bobby!
What would you like to drink?
We got beer, we got water Oh, I think beer.
Beer will be fine.
Beer.
Hey, listen I know that a party on a day like this must be really rough.
Hey, don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
Hey, that's the way to be.
Believe me.
Actually, I didn't have a bad day.
Oh, yeah?
Great!
As a matter of fact I had kind of a good day.
Super, super.
I'm playing Romeo off Broadway.
We open in two months.
Good!
I mean, what am I talking about, good?
That's great!
That's fantastic!
Hey, guys, did you hear this?
!
Did you hear that?
!
Yeah, well, you know, if you like revivals.
Yeah, yeah, that's nice, that's nice.
Nice?
!
Yeah.
Nice?
!
Alex, it's off Broadway!
It's unbelievable.
Oh!
Your first day out, kid, and you made it.
You made it.
You made it!
You made it!
You made it!
Hi, guys.
Hi, Bob.
Hello, Bob.
Hey, Louie, you got a cab for me?
What the hell are you laughing at?
Oh, he's laughing at my face.
Pretty funny, huh?
I haven't even gotten to your face yet.
Aw, come on.
Don't let him get to you, Bobby.
Bobby, I got it.
If you put some tanning stuff on this side of your face it wouldn't look so bad.
Look, Tony, please.
Hey, what difference does it make what my face looks like?
I'm a cabbie.
I mean, if I was an actor or something, then I'd be worried.
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you talking about?
I'm not an actor anymore.
Anymore?
Since when?
Oh, since I decided it was stupid.
Oh, no offense, Steve, you know.
See, I realized last night that making it as an actor is nothing but a bunch of luck, so I'm dedicating myself to be the best cab driver I can be.
I feel guilty.
I should be paying for this.
So, I called up my agent this morning, told him the same thing I just told you, and as soon as he reads the message it'll all be official.
I feel like a new man.
Um I'll be waiting right over here for my cab when it's ready, Mr. De Palma.
And it doesn't have to be anything nice.
Just whatever you got lying around.
Oh, gee, I wanted to give you a nice one.
Um, I know this is probably the wrong time to say this, but I'm sorry, Bobby.
Hey, don't be.
You did me a favor.
And good luck, 'cause you're going to need it.
Hey, Alex, could you help me with some more lines?
I got to get them down before this afternoon.
Yeah, sure.
Hey, on second thought, Steve, why don't you ask Bobby if he'd run over the lines with you?
You think he will?
I don't know.
Ask him.
Maybe he'll help you with those lines in the first scene-- you know the one I'm talking about?
I get it.
Hey, Bobby, could you help me for a minute?
I got to recite some things.
Oh, yeah, sure, I guess so.
But, listen, as soon as my cab is ready I'm going to have to go.
Oh, that's terrific.
Here, Steve.
Here, it's the scene between Romeo and Paris in the last act-- the fight scene.
Oh, yeah, I think I remember this.
We'll say this is Juliet's tomb.
Excuse me.
That's all right.
Okay, you ready?
Yeah, sure.
I'll start.
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, gorged with the dearest morsel of the Earth, thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open and in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
: "This is that banished haughty Montague "that murdered my love's cousin with which grief it is supposed" Bobby, I appreciate your help, but could you give me a little more?
Actors.
This is that banished haughty Montague that murdered my love's cousin, with which grief it is supposed the fair creature died and here is come to do some villainous shame to the dead bodies.
I will apprehend him.
Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
Obey and go with me, for thou must die.
I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.
Fly hence, leave me.
Think upon these gone!
Let them affright thee!
I beseech thee, youth, put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury!
O, be gone.
By heaven, I love thee better than myself for I come hither armed against myself!
Stay not, be gone!
Live, and hereafter say a madman's mercy bade thee run away!
I do defy thy conjurations and apprehend thee for a felon here.
Wilt thou provoke me?
Then have at thee, boy.
Oh Oh I am s-s-slain.
If if thou be merciful open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Thank you very much.
Hey, Bob.
Bobby!
Hey, Bob!
Hey, you know something, kid?
You're great.
You can't give up acting.
Bobby, that was so you know Yeah, I was brilliant, wasn't I?
Bob wow.
Thanks, Alex, but you see, if I can be this good and still not get a decent job, then it just proves that acting is nothing but luck and I am glad I'm quitting.
Ho, this day just keeps getting better by the minute.
Worked like a charm, didn't it, Rieger?
I got a better idea.
Let Bobby do the scene and he'll act it and say, "Why, I can't quit".
I wish I had this on film!
Thank you, Lord!
Thank you.
Hey, Louie.
Louie, uh, can I talk to you for a minute, please?
Yeah, but I can't promise to keep a straight face.
Okay.
You know something, Lou?
It's-it's really great to have a sense of humor, you know.
But I'm afraid the joke is over.
And nobody knows better than me nobody knows better than me, how hard it is to go after a dream that keeps slipping away.
You know, sometimes my career just seems like it's one obstacle after another.
It's nothing but a lot of heartbreaks, Louie.
You know, when I came in here today, I got to admit to you, I was beaten.
But I decided not to quit.
I found something, Louie.
I found something that's going to get me through all of that.
I've seen I've seen a light, and it's far away but it's strong, and it's steady, and it's going to get me through this, and I'm going to follow that light till the day I die, Lou.
And you want to know what that light is, Louie?
What?
That light is you, Lou.
You're my inspiration, and I'm going to keep digging and scratching and clawing as long as I know there's a chance that I might succeed, and maybe, maybe one day, maybe one day, I might be able to come back here in this garage and stuff every laugh you've ever had at my expense right down your throat.
Thank you, Louie.
You're welcome.
Now I have to go call my agent.
Well, Louie, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away.
You guys like the candy in this machine?
Yeah, why?
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Come on, Alex, it'll be fun.
No, no, no, Tony, I don't want to play softball against the day shift.
They got a lot of great guys on that team.
They're gonna kill us.
Alex, they put on their pants one leg at a time just like us.
Well, If they want to have pants-putting-on contest, I'm in.
Come on, Alex, it'll be fun.
Please?
Please, please, please.
No.
Okay, okay, Tony, look, if, if my plans fall apart on Saturday and I have nothing better to do, and I, uh, feel in the mood to be humiliated, I might just drop by.
We've got Alex.
Oh, come on.
Rieger, I got a message for ya.
All right, here's your buck.
Thank you.
Message, message, Rieger, yeah.
Here you go, right here.
"Phil called-- everything's ready for Thursday".
Phil called?
Hey, wait a minute, I don't understand this.
I don't even know a Phil.
You want the message explained, it'll cost you another buck.
All right, here's a buck-- explain.
All right.
Ah, the explanation is I gave you the wrong message.
Hey.
Yours will cost you another dollar.
But I'll put it on your tab.
Hey, guys, guess who called?
Who?
Angela Matusa.
Angela Matusa, you remember her from about a year ago.
She used to work for Bobby's answering service.
Come on, you guys met her.
Nice kid, great sense of humor fat.
Angela!
Oh, Angela!
Yeah.
I remember her.
Big Angie Matusa, the apartment house with legs.
Hey, Tone, she'd make a great catcher for your baseball team.
That dame could cover the plate, the umpire and the sun.
You say she's coming here, Rieger?
I'll prepare for her arrival.
Open the loading docks!
That's okay, Alex, everybody does their own thing.
Some men climb mountains, others date 'em.
Hey, Louie, cage time.
Oh, I think I'm gonna write these bon mots down, before I forget them.
Oh, for crying out loud.
Don't worry, Alex, you'll not hear another witty remark from me until she gets here.
Lock up the candy machine.
Hey, Alex, you keep telling us how terrific she is, but all I can remember is she was big and mean.
Well, she was at first.
I couldn't get through to her.
I remember our first date, though.
We ate at Mario's.
The evening just fell apart.
Why don't you drop the act now, huh?
What?
What act?
Pretending you're not having a lousy time.
Hey, come on, Angela.
What the?
What do you still got your coat on for?
The management requested it.
Don't you care for your salad?
I wouldn't know if I cared for it or not; I didn't eat it.
Hey, now, what's with you?
Look, you don't have to bother seeing me home.
No, no, no.
I'll take you.
I'll take you.
No, really I'm one of the few women in New York who's safe on the streets.
Hey, now, now, come on.
You you came with me, you're leaving with me.
Listen, let's not spoil a lovely evening by arguing, okay?
And, hey, don't worry, you did your duty; you proved you we're a nice guy.
Hey, I-I'm taking you.
Get your paws off me.
They give you a little dinner, they think they own you.
Yeah, she was really down on herself because of her weight.
But we became good friends.
You know, I mean Ah, but then about six months later, she, uh we lost touch.
She stopped answering my phone calls and, uh Hey, listen, uh She's very sensitive about this, so, uh, when she gets here please don't mention anything about weight, okay?
Okay.
Please?
Hi, Alex.
Angela!
My God, you lost a ton!
The only thing that could spoil this moment if Cheryl Tiegs was standing behind me.
Hey, Bob!
Yeah.
You remember Angela?
Holy cow!
You look terrific.
Oh!
It's some kind of miracle or something.
How much did you lose?
About a hundred pounds.
I have a ways to go, but I'm still trying.
A hundred pounds!
Whoa.
How'd you do it?
Oh, this doctor put me on a special diet.
He said I could eat anything as long as it wasn't food.
Hey, Angela, you look sensational.
Yeah.
You don't know how many pounds I've waited to hear somebody say that.
I joined this weight group and it's really changing my life-- new hairdo, new clothes, new job.
I did save one of my old dresses, though.
Yeah, for old times' sake?
Nah, I throw it over my car when it rains.
Ahoy, there!
Has anyone seen anything of the great white whale?
Great white whale, that's funny.
Uh Uh Louie Louie.
Uh, Louie, Louie, I'd like you to meet someone, okay?
Louie, this is Angela.
She's not so fat.
He was going to hit you with a whole bunch of fat jokes.
Hey, Louie, congratulate her.
She lost 100 pounds.
Well, it's really great that you lost all that weight.
You should be very proud of yourself.
Thank you.
But, hey, if you ever bloat up again, come and see me.
It's nice you brought me here again, Alex.
Well, I figured we had such fun here last time.
Okay, decided yet?
Oh, sure, uh, Angela?
Uh, let me just calculate my calories here.
Uh, let's see.
I'll have, uh, chicken, no skin; broccoli, no butter; salad, no dressing; and no dessert.
Well, uh, that sounds pretty good.
Oh, excuse me.
Wait a minute.
Hey, Alex, do you want me to have a good time?
Yeah.
Then order what you'd normally have.
I can handle it, honest.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, Tommy, I'll have, um salad, Thousand Island dressing, Veal Marsala, linguini in clam sauce,  and, uh, garlic bread.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm s Oh, that's right.
That's too much, right?
No, it's Make the salad dressing Hundred Island.
Hey, Angela, I hope you don't get too tired of hearing how great you look.
Are you kidding?
Huh?
I'm loving all this attention I'm getting.
You know what happened to me the other day?
What?
I, Angela Matusa, got whistled at for the first time in my life.
Whoo!
Hey, that's neat.
I bet you were a little embarrassed, though, right?
Yeah, and frustrated.
I chased him six blocks and lost him in an alley.
I really admire what you're doing, you know that?
I mean, I know how hard it is to kick a tough habit.
I quit smoking.
Yeah?
Yep.
Well, I'm telling you, there was a time when I never thought I'd be able to say "I haven't smoked for ten years".
It can be done.
I'm telling you it can be done.
All it takes is a little, uh, confidence and, um, another nine years.
I know what you mean.
I tried dieting lots of times, and it never took.
I guess I just didn't have enough motivation.
And then suddenly I found a key.
Funny, it was there all the time.
What was it?
Men.
Men?
You're right, we were here all that time.
Well, not really men-- one particular man I wanted to attract.
He was nice to me.
He treated me like a person, even when I wasn't feeling like one.
That sounds like one great guy.
He sure is.
Um, um  Hey, Alex, tell me something.
Yeah, what?
Could you ever have those kind of feelings for me?
Those feelings?
Angela, come on.
This is not a simple thing, you know.
I mean, uh look, uh, here's what we're going to do, okay?
This is what we're going to do.
Let's just, um, um No, no, on second thought, let's, uh, um Look, Angela, wait a minute, I got it, this is it.
Look, why don't we just go out a couple of times and, uh, you know, get to know each other better and then, uh, maybe go out again and see what happens.
I mean, uh, see what develops.
How does that sound?
Hey, Alex, aren't you just saying this because I put you on the spot and you're afraid of hurting my feelings?
Yeah.
Okay, how about Friday night?
No, wait, look, look, maybe maybe we shouldn't.
Look, it's a terrible habit of mine not being able to say no, and I-I think I should start sometime.
Well, start tomorrow.
No!
Oh, Angela, I Angela, I'm really sorry.
I, um Hey, Alex, don't worry about it.
Angela, I'm really sorry about this.
I mean, I feel terrible.
Uh, Alex, don't.
I mean, it's because of your help that I lost And, uh, maybe there'll be another guy.
And if I can lose 100 pounds for you, maybe I can lose 150 for somebody with a better nose.
Uh, listen, uh, you want to leave?
No, I want you to leave.
What?
I just want to sit here, Alex, and collect my thoughts.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure, it's what I want.
I, um You know, I just wish once we could leave this place together.
Here we go boneless, skinless chicken and broccoli, Veal Marsala and linguini and clams and garlic bread.
What do you say, Elaine-- Saturday morning, fresh air, sunshine?
I'll put you in right field, I promise.
Oh, Tony, I didn't tell you, but my grandparents are coming in from Buffalo this weekend.
Great.
That's my outfield.
Grandma's in center, Grandpa's playing left.
All right, Bobby, what do you want to play?
Oh T-Tony, listen, how many times do I got to tell you?
I'm a lousy baseball player.
You don't want me on your team.
I-I can't even catch a ball.
Listen, listen, listen.
There's plenty of time before Saturday.
I'll give you a few pointers.
Come on.
We'll throw this around.
I'll straighten you out.
Come on.
Okay, but it's pointless, Tony.
That's all right.
Come on.
Try and grab this one.
You ready?
All right, here we go, whoa.
See, I stink.
I told you.
What do you mean?
So far, you're the only guy in the garage who knew enough to bend over.
Congratulations, you're my shortstop.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Alex Rieger.
He's not here yet.
Wait a minute.
You're fat.
Just a second.
What did I do with that list?
Now, don't waddle away-- I'll find it.
Hey, look, all I want to do is talk to Alex Rieger.
Keep your tent on.
I can't find it-- I had some great things.
You're so fat, you probably heard them all anyway.
I prefer to think of myself as portly.
Did you say "portly" or "porky"?
What do I need a list for?
I'm gold.
You guys hear that-- portly, porky?
Hey, Rieger, el battleshippo wants to talk to you.
Hi, I'm Alex Rieger.
Uh, I'm sorry about Louie.
Yeah, I'm not too thrilled with him either.
I'm Wayne Hubbard.
I'd like to talk to you about Angela Matusa.
She's a friend of mine.
Angela?
Why?
Wha-wha Is something wrong?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
See, we'd always go to the weight control meetings together.
Yeah.
And on the way home we usually stop off for a cup of coffee-- no cream or sugar.
Oh.
I look forward to it all week long.
Oh, that's nice.
Uh, yeah, she's a great girl, isn't she?
Why do you say something's wrong?
Well, she called me tonight and she said she wasn't going.
Well, maybe she doesn't feel well.
No, no.
She hasn't missed a meeting in, in six months.
Oh.
Are those almonds?
Peanuts.
You want to talk over here?
Wh-wh-what is it?
Look, she's, uh, she thinks a lot of you, Angela, because we're always talking and she always brings up your name.
And, uh Mm.
That's why I came here, I hope, I hope you don't mind.
No, it's fine.
Oh, barbecued flavor?
Uh, uh, Wayne, Wayne, uh, why did you say something Wayne, Wayne, Wayne, Wayne Why do you say something is wrong?
When I talked to her on the phone, she was, uh, really down.
And usually when she's depressed I can talk to her and joke with her and pick up her spirits.
Yeah?
But it didn't work.
Yeah, I know how that is.
Uh, y-you seem to know her quite well.
Yeah, I haven't admitted it to anybody, but, uh, I'm really crazy about her.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well, why, why don't you go to her apartment and talk to her?
I don't think she's home.
Huh?
'Cause while I was talking to her on the phone, in the background, I think I heard the faint clattering of cutlery.
Restaurant?
Food, very bad.
Listen, we got to find her.
I'll get my coat; I'll be right with you.
Okay, uh, I'll get my car and pick you up out front.
Hey, where should we look?
I don't know.
We'll split up, and we'll check all the restaurants in her neighborhood.
Okay.
I called a few that she used to like, and either she wasn't eating there or maybe she's eating under an assumed name.
Alex, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help but overhear.
No, no, I got to go Elaine.
I got to go.
Are you sure you want to get involved in this?
Of course I do.
Wouldn't you?
Well, Alex, can I talk to you a minute?
Huh?
I just hope that, uh, that you're not gonna be too disappointed if there's nothing you can do to help Angela.
I mean, some people just can't be helped.
What are you talking about?
I refuse to believe that.
Hey, Alex.
Your friend's waiting for you outside.
Yeah, I know.
Thanks.
You can't miss him.
He's the guy wearing the Plymouth.
Hey, Angela, I was looking all over town for you.
Never thought I'd find you in a dump like this.
Sorry.
Go away, Alex.
Look, Angela, I know I'm not your favorite person right now.
I don't want to talk to you, Alex.
You know, I have every right to feel upset right now.
I mean, you put me in a great spot.
You know that?
It's like every bite you're taking is my fault.
Oh, Alex, don't blame yourself.
It's got nothing to do with you.
Ah It's my problem.
I should be used to it by now.
I've had it for as long as I can remember.
You know, I wasn't even invited to my senior prom.
Big surprise?
But I was too embarrassed to tell my parents, so I lied to them.
I told them I had a date.
The theme was "Three Coins in a Fountain".
And they had a real live fountain right in the middle of the gym floor.
And you know where I was, Alex?
I was standing on the outside looking in.
I had to stand on a garbage can to look in the window.
Oh, Angela.
And then halfway through, it started to rain.
So I walked around till 2:00 in the morning in the rain.
I wanted my parents to think I was having a good time.
I completely ruined the dress.
Fortunately, when I got home, my parents were sleeping, so I went in the kitchen and ate a turkey.
Oh, that's terrible, Angela.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You're always doing this, Angela.
You're always doing this.
You're always using your pain as an excuse not to help yourself.
Now, look, you're not the only person that's suffered in this world, you know.
Everybody's got a story like that.
Okay, let's hear yours.
I knew I shouldn't have said that.
Here's your pork chops.
You want me to get a head start on something else?
No, no, Angela, Angela, please don't.
You look so great.
Who cares?
What do you mean "who cares"?
A lot of people care.
There's a guy out there right now, looking all over the city for you.
Who?
Wayne Hubbard.
Wayne?
Yeah.
He came around to the garage and asked me to help him look for you.
He told me he cared for you a great deal.
Wayne-- he's a real sweet, sensitive guy.
I couldn't have gotten through the last few months without him.
Did Did you ever think of dating him?
That blimp?
No, Angela, that real sweet, sensitive guy.
Yeah.
You like him, don't you?
Don't push this, Rieger.
No, come on.
I could tell by that look on your face when I brought him up, huh?
Okay, okay, I like him.
Yeah, yeah.
Those feelings?
Those little feelings, Angela?
You.
But I've been resisting it.
Why?
I mean, if you like the guy wait a minute.
It's not his weight, is it?
Of course not.
Wayne.
Oh, thank God you found her.
Angela, I'm very worried about you.
I've been to every restaurant in this city.
This is the first one I haven't felt like eating in.
Look, I didn't invite any of you people in here.
Shh.
I thought I could do something to help you.
Oh, you know, you two are really cute, you know that?
I mean, all this time you had special feelings for each other and you were just too shy to come out and admit it.
That's even cuter, you know?
Look, Wayne, I'm sorry.
I broke down; I told Angela how you felt about her.
I never knew, Wayne.
Angela, we've been through so much together, you and I. : Yeah.
You're one of the most wonderful people that I have ever met.
I think you're pretty special, too.
Cute.
Cute, cute, cute.
Isn't that something?
Cute.
But, Wayne, I don't know if this is going to work out.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
You don't have one problem that can't be solved.
Now, come on.
Don't let this relationship get away.
When it's right, it's right, right?
Hey, look, if you two aren't going to do anything about it, I will.
Why don't we go somewhere for a cup of coffee?
Angela, listen to Alex.
When it's right, it's right.
Okay, let's go to my apartment and have a cup of coffee.
No cream?
No sugar.
Wow, just when you thought it couldn't get any cuter.
Aren't they cute?
Isn't that cute?
Oh, gee, Alex, you're always coming into my life and straightening things out for me.
I wish there was something I could do to help you out.
Angela, Angela, you have already, you have.
Someone just told me that people can't help each other.
Well, you just proved that they can.
Now, look.
I want you both to walk right out that door with my blessing.
And never mind all those little, uh, problems that might get in the way.
Alex, incidentally, about what we were talking about?
Yeah.
The reason I didn't go out with Wayne had nothing to do with his weight.
No?
No, I think he's adorable.
So what was the reason?
His wife and four kids.
Bye, Alex.
Thanks a lot, Alex.
That's cute.
Oh, shut up!
That was even more humiliating than I expected it to be.
Oh, come on.
It's not that bad.
The longest two hours of my life.
Hey, Tommy, give us two six-packs to go, please.
We wouldn't have got any hits at all if it wasn't for Elaine's grandmother hit that double.
I'll give you one thing, Wheeler-- you don't lie.
You are a lousy ball player.
What do you mean?
I stole second base standing up.
Yeah, but from third?
In case you hadn't noticed, you weren't pitching so well, Tony.
All right, so I got mixed up on some signs.
What signs?
You only got two pitches, Tony-- balls and home runs.
Thanks, Tommy.
Yeah.
Hey, where are you guys going now?
Break's over.
We've got to get back for the second inning.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Oh What's wrong?
Ah, beer's too cold.
It's no colder than usual.
I don't know, maybe I got a bad tooth.
: Alex, uh, a bad tooth isn't a maybe thing.
I got a bad tooth.
Yeah.
It's all right, though.
It doesn't hurt until I, uh, drink something cold or suck air through my teeth.
And you haven't done anything about it?
I quit sucking air through my teeth.
Why don't you see a dentist?
I can't get myself to make an appointment.
Oh.
Alex, you're afraid of dentists?
No, not dentists, necessarily.
I'm just afraid of any man who likes to dig and pick in someone's mouth with sharp instruments, that's all.
Alex, why don't you let me make an appointment for you?
I've got a dentist who's almost painless.
Okay, look, make the appointment for me, but please do me one favor-- don't tell me when until it's just time to go.
I want just enough time to get there and not enough time to think about it.
Ow.
Ow.
Do you know that you're acting like a child?
Oh, yeah, and tell him I want to be treated like a child.
: I'll make him do it.
Oh, wow Hmm?
That's a beautiful lady.
I'm in love.
With my woman?
Hey, I saw her first.
What do you mean you saw her first?
What makes you think you saw her first?
Uh, I'm a boxer-- my reactions are quicker.
Great.
She's alone.
She's also available.
Oh, come on, Bobby.
You don't know that.
Well, sure I do.
She's not wearing a ring.
You caught that when she walked by?
Hey, Tony, I'm an actor.
I'm trained to observe people closely.
Okay What color is Tony's shirt?
I don't know.
: Alex's shirt?
I don't know.
The buttons on her coat?
Brown with tan marbling and rose-colored thread.
He's right!
Lucky guess.
Hey, I pay attention to women, you know?
: Too much.
What are you talking about?
You don't pay attention to women-- you, uh, collect them.
Hey, y-you know, that's not true, Elaine.
Oh, no?
How many women have you dated this year?
Who counts?
You.
Fifteen.
I'm asking her out.
How can you ask her out?
I'm going to ask her out.
Aw, come on, Bobby.
Let me, man.
I'm your friend.
I need her more than you do.
I mean, really.
What are you talking about?
You're going out with Cathy.
Oh, no.
I broke up with her.
When?
Soon as I can get to a telephone.
Well, listen, I'm real sorry about that, but I got to ask this lady out, man.
Aw, come on.
How come you can't pass up one woman for a friend?
Hormones, I guess.
I don't know.
I got just as many hormones as you, maybe more.
Anyway, why should you get her?
Because I saw her first, man.
No, no, Bobby.
I saw her first.
No, I saw her first.
Will you guys sit down?
Now, we're not gonna get anywhere with an argument like that.
You have to think of a more reasonable way to do this.
Why don't we flip a coin?
Okay.
All right.
Hey, Alex, you flip it.
Yeah.
I can't believe this.
Hmm?
You are actually going to do that?
I mean, she is a person there, not some object to be obtained by one lousy flip of a coin.
You know, Elaine's right-- make it two out of three.
Good.
You're actually going to do this?
Hey, we gotta do something, Elaine.
We both can't ask her out, can we?
Hey, Bobby, how come we both can't ask her out?
That's fair, ain't it?
We both saw her.
I'd ask her out if he wasn't here, and you'd ask her out if I wasn't here, so let's both ask her out like nobody's here.
Argue with that one.
Hey, I think that makes sense.
I'll ask her first.
Wait a minute.
Let's both go first.
We can't both go first.
Oh, look, it doesn't make any difference who goes first.
It's a bad idea.
What if she agrees to go out with both of you?
Hey, Alex, come on.
There aren't that many women that like either one of us, let alone both of us.
You know, and, and if she says no to both of us, that's fine.
If she says yes, it's no big deal.
We both go out with her and whoever hits it off best, well, that's the way it is.
But, but, but what if you both start dating her?
Hey, we're not going to have to face that, 'cause we're gonna settle this after the first date.
Okay, let's agree that we both go out with her, and whoever hits it off best with her gets to keep her.
Okay.
All right.
Hey, but who gets to ask her first?
We'll let Alex flip a coin for that.
Okay.
All right, Alex.
Go ahead.
Come on.
Come on, Alex.
Come on.
Okay, okay.
Just one flip.
All right.
All right.
Call it.
Tails.
Tails.
Which is it?
What do you mean, "Which is it""?
Just one of you call it.
Well, which one of us, Alex?
I'm thinking of a number Five.
I wanted five.
Tough luck.
Why don't you draw straws to see who gets five?
Okay, look, uh, Tony, you got heads, Bobby you got tails.
Okay?
Once again.
All right.
Tails.
Thanks a lot, Alex.
Hey, uh wish me luck, all right?
Not the hair flip.
And on top of that, he's going to use one of them great lines of his.
You know, the guy's got a million great lines, Elaine.
They all work, too-- every one of them.
You know, I ain't got one great line.
Look at him.
It's working-- it's really working.
Oh there's not a thing I can do about it, either.
Nothing.
Nothing I can do.
Yes, there is.
Hey, lady!
Anything he says-- me, too.
You almost through with the cab?
Yes, almost.
Good boy, Latka.
Ten cabs in one day-- that's a lot of work, isn't it?
Yes, I know.
Okay, now, just so that you know that your work hasn't gone unnoticed-- as soon as you finish with this cab Yeah.
I'm going to let you tune up my mother's car.
But but, eh, but that is more work.
No, no, no.
Ma's tune-up is a bonus.
Oh : A bonus.
Bonus?
Yeah.
But, what is a bonus?
A bonus is is something that a boss gives a worker when he thinks he's doing a good job.
Congratulations.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Not so fast.
Is bonus good?
Bonus?
Sure, it's great.
Yeah, everyone wants one.
Okay, thank you very much.
There's plenty more where that came from.
Hi, guys.
Hi.
Well, hiya, Tony.
Whadda you say, Lou?
How was your weekend?
Oh, it was good.
Did you and Bobby both go out with Janet?
Yup.
He took her out on Friday, and I took her out on Saturday.
Oh.
Oh.
So what happens now?
You, uh, compare notes?
Declare a winner?
Collect the prize?
Hey, Elaine, I don't know what you're getting so upset about.
Hey, Elaine, uh, can I speak to you man to man?
Sure.
Elaine Bobby's a good-looking guy, huh?
Yeah.
He's probably, like, the best-looking guy in the garage?
Oh, gee, I don't know, he might be.
He's fun to be with most of the time?
Yeah, I, I'd say so.
And he's probably the most talented and most interesting guy around?
: Could be, yeah.
Gee, the guy's got the market cornered on everything but pitiful.
Ah, but Tony, you're attractive, too.
Yeah?
Yeah.
How attractive?
I mean, like, on a scale of one to ten, where Louie's one and Robert Redford's number ten.
Um, I think there's more than nine numbers between those two.
But Tony, in my book you're a ten.
Elaine Oh  Hey, hello, Bob.
Hey, Al.
Hey, Bobby, how'd it go Friday?
Friday?
Friday.
What was Friday?
Oh, Friday!
Oh, you mean my date with Janet.
Oh, yeah, yeah Yeah, how'd it work out for you?
How'd it work out for you?
I asked you first.
Here we go again.
It was great, Tony.
I know.
She's the kind of girl you could really get serious about.
You know, my date with her was one of the greatest nights of my whole life.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I got that beat, 'cause my date with her was one of the greatest nights of my life.
I guess you're not going to give her up, huh?
No, I'm going out with her again tomorrow.
But I got tickets for the fights for us tomorrow.
Well, it's too bad, Tony, because I'm going to ask her out.
Going to ask her out?
I Ooh!
Not if I can get to her Tony : Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.
Uh, you can't dial from there.
Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.
All right.
Now, give me that receiver, Tony.
Tony, give it to me, and don't make me do something I'm going to regret-- like hitting myself and getting killed.
Hey, hey, hey.
Now, now, this is getting out of hand, here.
Yeah, it's rotten.
It's really rotten.
You want to know how rotten it is?
Look.
Louie likes it.
Now, come on.
Okay, okay okay, listen, Tony, I'm not going to fight you over the receiver.
Here, take it.
Oh, well, that's good, Bobby.
Hey, thanks, Bob.
I just remembered, she's not home.
Hey, Bobby, I got to warn you.
I really am serious about this girl.
Tony, you're not right for her.
Can't you see that?
I mean, what are you gonna possibly talk to her about when you're alone?
What are you saying?
He's saying you're stupid.
Hey, Louie?
Louie, shut up, will ya?
I wouldn't take that from him, Banta.
Is that what you're saying, Bobby?
Now, hey, Tony y Is it?
Well, listen, I wasn't going to put it that way.
That's it, Bob, you just went too far.
Tony, now, just take it easy.
No, man.
I can't let nobody say things like that.
I don't let nobody call me stupid.
Tony, you're a boxer.
You've got to remember that.
You're a boxer.
Don't worry about it-- he's a boxer like you're an actor.
No, Bobby, I can't let you shoot your mouth off like that.
You call me stupid, you gotta get hit.
Tony, you can't hit me.
I barely survive the poking.
Tony, now, come on.
No, Elaine.
I'm going to do this this time.
What?
O-O-Okay, okay, listen, uh I'll hit myself.
What is he talking about?
No, no, no, really, look, look.
I'll let me do it, all right?
Not hard enough.
That's harder than you've ever hit anybody.
Hey, hey, hey.
I can take direction.
One of, one of the things I'm good at, okay.
All right.
Here we go.
Now, now, Tony, that one really staggered me.
In the face.
Oh, oh, oh, Tony Tony, not the face.
Oh, oh, okay, okay, the face, all right.
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
Cut this out, cut this out.
What am I doing?
Breaking up a fight between one guy.
No!
No!
We still got something to settle, Bobby.
Well, can't you settle it without fists?
Don't ask them to match wits-- we'll be here all day.
You know what really bothers me about this?
It's that neither one of you has even considered making a sacrifice for your friendship.
All right, I'll make a sacrifice.
I won't hit Bobby.
Oh!
Well, uh, it's a start.
What about you?
Okay, I won't hit me, either.
Can't be fairer than that, can we?
But Tony, as far as Janet's concerned, it's war.
Yeah, and may the best man win.
Eh!
You know who I feel sorry for?
That poor young girl.
Torn between two losers.
Hi, Bob.
Hey, Alex.
Ooh, your girlfriend Janet called.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, what'd she want?
Tony.
Hey, Alex, uh, could you lend me 30 bucks?
I want to take Janet out tonight.
Now, look, this is getting ridiculous, you know that?
You borrow money from me to take her someplace expensive, then Tony borrows money from me to take her someplace more expensive, then you borrow money from me to take her someplace even more expensive than that!
I've never spent so much money on a woman in my life.
All right.
Bobby I hear you, eh, you have a new girlfriend?
Me, too.
Oh, then what is, eh, your, the name of your girlfriend?
Janet.
Oh, and what is the name of your girlfriend?
Janet.
Oh, well, that's easy to remember; it's the same name.
It's the same girl.
Wait a minute.
You're, you mean, you mean, you're going to, to tell me you're telling me that is one girl and she loves the both of you and she care for both of you and go out with both of you?
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.
Well, could I meet her?
Hey, Alex, uh, could I borrow $30?
I have to take No!
Now, look, this business with Janet has got to stop right now.
You can't go on spending the kind of money you've been spending-- mine!
Hey, Alex, I really, I hate to do it, honest, but I got to keep up with Bobby.
I mean You guys are going about this all wrong.
What do you mean?
Well, uh Well, how does Janet feel about it?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You mean, neither of you has had a serious conversation with her about this problem?
No, I, I haven't.
Have you, Tony?
Uh-uh.
Well, uh, well, what do you guys talk about with her when you're alone?
Well, I don't know Oh, how great she is Me, too.
Anything else?
Oh, what beautiful eyes she has Yeah, we had that talk.
Yeah, then we talk about me sometimes, you know.
Oh, me, too.
She calls me her, uh,-- sorry, Bobby-- her tough teddy bear.
Her, uh, smart teddy bear.
Ah A very complex relationship.
Yeah.
I haven't seen anything like it since I stopped reading Archie comic books.
You know something, Elaine?
I've had just about enough from you.
Careful, Nardo.
If he gets mad he could beat himself silly.
I mean, you've been going around making a lot of snide remarks for the last week, since this thing with Janet started.
A-And if you got any better ideas how to handle it, I'd like to hear them.
Okay, I got a better idea.
Yeah, okay, come on.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Janet which one of you she prefers to go on seeing?
Oh, that's crazy.
Hey, it's okay with me, Bobby.
I think Elaine's idea is a great one-- a lot cheaper.
Hey, it's all right with me.
I, uh, I'm going to meet her at Mario's in a little while.
I'll ask her then.
Hey, wait a minute.
I got to be there when she chooses.
Okay, but you let me explain things to her.
Hey, wait a minute, Bob.
We gotta do this together, Bob.
We can't both do it together, Tony.
Well, then let Alex do it, he's neutral.
Great.
Hey Hey, Alex could you do this thing for us?
Now, now, look.
Enough of this high school stuff, okay?
Now, the answer is no and you'll just have to accept it.
Now, I'm not gonna get any more involved with this little triangle that you're trying to form here.
Well, it's a good thing, 'cause you can't go anyway.
Why not?
You have a dentist appointment in 30 minutes.
Ah, here you go, gentlemen.
Draft light lukewarm.
Enjoy it.
What are you gonna say to her, Alex?
You'll just have to wait to find out, just like I am.
I don't know.
I guess I'll just say, uh, "Janet, you'll have to help us out here, "because my friends are just too infantile and immature "and just plain silly to be able to deal with this situation all by themselves".
I like it.
I like it.
Yeah, that'll get her attention, boy, let me tell you.
Ooh, there they are tweedle-dumb and tweedle-dumber.
And who's this I see standing at the bar?
Why, Land-o-Goshen, it's Mary Worth.
Glad I got a good seat for this one.
Wouldn't want to miss a moment.
Tommy, suds.
Coming up, Louie.
Louie, will you get lost?
Not a chance.
I'll give you a buck.
It's worth more than a buck to me to see one of these guys get blown out of the saddle.
All right, make it ten bucks.
Okay.
See ya.
Thanks, Alex.
Hi, guys.
Dump the both of them.
Hi, Bobby.
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Janet.
I didn't expect to see you here.
Oh, but I'm glad you are.
I've got something for you.
You left your watch at my place.
I had it engraved.
Oh, wow "To Tony, the next heavyweight champ".
Gee, thanks, Janet, but you shouldn't have done this.
Why not?
I wanted to.
I'm a middleweight.
And it's my watch.
Janet, listen.
Here, sit down for a second, okay?
Something's come up that's real serious, and, uh, we got to talk about it.
Yeah, all three of us.
This may be the most intimate and personal problem that we've ever had to deal with.
What is it?
Alex'll tell you.
Look, Janet, there's hardly anything that I can say that you haven't thought of all by yourself, anyway.
I mean, you must realize that this situation has to come to an end.
What situation?
What situation?
Well, I mean, the fact you're going out with Bobby and Tony at the same time.
I mean, you must understand, you know, that this can't go on any longer.
Why not?
Why not?
I'm beginning to wish that I went to the dentist.
You-you're not going to make me choose one of them, are you?
Hey, Janet, what Alex is trying to say is, uh Tony and I, we're just not mature enough to handle this thing.
We know we're putting you on the spot, Janet, but it's killing us.
You're really serious about this?
I mean, you're prepared to have me choose one of you right now, and both of you will accept it?
Yeah, we talked it over and we're sure we can handle this.
Okay, my choice is  Wait a minute!
Hey, it just can't be that easy for you.
Yeah, take a minute, mull it over.
Yeah.
Come on, now, take your time.
I mean, 'cause we're in no hurry.
Yeah, yeah.
Go over to another table and work on it for a while.
You know, make it look tough, anyway.
There's a table over there.
Boy.
Well, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
I'm gonna go.
There are other tattered lives to mend, you know.
Alex, you know, Tony and I, we really would like to repay you, you know.
Yeah, well, don't mention it.
Yeah, but we'd really like to No, that's how you will repay me-- by not mentioning it ever again.
Thank you.
Well, I guess this is it, Tone.
Yeah, I guess so, Bobby.
You know, I I just want to say, Tony, you know, I-I've been acting real crummy the past week, and, uh I-I just want to say I'm sorry.
Me, too, Bobby.
Yeah.
How am I doing?
Will you shut up!
All right.
Here's my decision.
It's Hold it wai-wait a minute, I I don't think I want to hear it.
Now what?
Well, it just occurred to me that no matter what your decision is, one of us is going to feel really lousy, and I don't want that to be my friend Tony, and even more important, I don't want it to be me.
So, uh, I don't think I want to hear your choice is.
Whisper it.
Tony!
Don't you understand what I'm saying here?
Our friendship could end forever right here.
Eh, maybe you got a point, Bobby.
So let me understand this: Now, neither one of you wants to see me anymore?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what it comes down to.
Well, that's real nice.
I mean, the two of you have made up your minds and you don't care what I have so say.
Listen, I know this is, like, really hard on you and everything.
Yeah, and we're real sorry, Janet.
No, no, don't apologize.
If that's the way you want it, that's the way it'll be.
I certainly don't want to come between good friends.
I'd sure like to know how to get back at you.
Maybe this way: Maybe, maybe by telling you that I was going to see to it that the guy I chose had the time of his life tonight.
The kind of night that men dream about.
The kind of night that that would be so good that it'd make a man real happy that he's a man.
Oh, by the way?
Um, I don't have to stick to anybody's rules.
The person that I was going to pick Hey, it doesn't make any difference was Bobby.
Oh, no, no, no!
I think we did the right thing.
Alex, I made another dentist appointment for you.
Oh.
Great, Elaine.
Thank you.
Oh, same deal as before?
Don't tell me until it's just about time to go?
Okay.
Okay, thanks.
It's time.
Now?
You got ten minutes to get there.
Come on.
I can't go now.
My tooth stopped hurting.
Hey, imagine that.
Go figure-- teeth.
Alex, a bad tooth doesn't just get better.
No, no, no.
Elaine, I'm fine.
Really, I'm fine.
I open for a quarter.
Okay.
Okay.
Drink this cold soda pop.
Sure.
I don't know how you did that, but if you are that determined not to go, well, forget it.
Elaine?
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Okay, listen up here!
Listen up, everybody.
I'm upstairs getting chewed out by the boss because of your lousy bookings.
Now, I don't want to embarrass anybody but Nardo, $41.
Hmm?
Banta, $52.
When I was a driver, I was ashamed to show my face in the garage if I had less than a hundred dollars.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What I wouldn't give for a garage full of Louie De Palmas.
Hey, Louie, do us a favor.
Don't give us that speech about how great a driver you were.
Please.
What are you, embarrassed, Banta?
You should be ashamed to be in the same garage with me.
I'm ashamed to be in the same species with you.
Funny, Nardo.
What I need are cab drivers.
What I got are a bunch of Jan Murrays.
I could get in this cab right now and outbook anybody.
Sure, Louie, if you say so.
You don't think so, Wheeler?
Uh, as a matter of fact, I don't.
Then try me.
Call my bluff.
Okay, you're on.
You want a showdown, then a showdown you're gonna get if it's the only thing that's gonna shut your mouth.
Man-to-man, one-on-one, you against Alex.
Hey, he's our best booker, right?
And I say he can outbook you anytime anywhere.
Hey, Bob, Bob Alex, can you stay out of this, please?
Now, if you're not gonna accept the challenge, then you'd better shut your mouth about how good you are.
Get that finger out of my face.
No.
That's my hand!
My hand!
Uh, now now that we've all calmed down a little, can I say something here, huh?
Look, I don't like saying this in front of him, but, uh, well, I was here when Louie was a driver and, uh, well, he's telling the truth about how good he was.
He brought in a lot of money.
I think we better put this to music.
Hey, Alex, hey, you can't back down.
I really believe you can beat him.
Look, it's not a matter of beating him.
I-I-I just don't like the idea, that's all.
This is our chance to humiliate the little creep.
I like that idea.
No, no, look I forget it.
Rieger's got more brains than to tangle with De Palma.
I don't blame him for chickening out.
Now, Louie!
Now, don't start on this, Louie!
I get involved with things like this, I, uh, go a little crazy, and I don't like myself like that.
Hey, Louie, Louie, look.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
I, uh Look, Louie, I-I've never tried to talk to you man-to-man before, but, uh, or even as a human being, but let me try right now.
Look, uh it-it's taken me a long time to, uh, get over competitiveness in my life and, well, I think I finally did it and, uh well, I like it that way, you understand?
And, uh okay?
So let's just-let's just forget this, all right?
Huh?
All right, Alex.
I understand.
Thanks, Louie.
Hey, any eggs in here, Jeff?
No.
There're a lot of chickens around.
Louie!
Louie!
You cluck one more time, just one more time, I'm going to take you up on that silly little contest, and I'll beat you, Lou.
You're on!
Great!
Okay, tomorrow night, Alex versus Louie for the driving championship of the garage-- King Cabbie!
Tomorrow night?
What's wrong with tonight?
If we're doing this thing, let's do it right now.
The sooner the better, Rieger.
All right.
Jeff, fetch my badge.
Latka!
Are these two cabs ready to go out?
Yes, they are, Louie.
Ibida!
Ibida.
All right.
I know this is the biggest bet I ever made in my life, but I think my friend, Alex, will win.
I got a hundred bucks says Alex beats you.
I'll cover that.
You got it.
Anybody else here want to prove they're as dumb as Banta?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
All right, I'll cover it all.
Jeff, collect that money.
All right I'm going to do this thing in style.
Feast your eyes on a money-making machine.
Okay, I'm ready!
All right.
The winner's the guy who brings in the most money in eight hours.
Right, right.
What are the rules?
There are no rules.
Makes it hard to cheat.
Good luck, Alex.
Thanks, Elaine.
I-I just know you're gonna win.
You know, if I had any extra money, man, I'd bet on you.
Aw, thanks.
I'll cover that.
No, Louie, I don't have any extra money this week.
My rent's due, and I gotta You got something better than money, Nardo-- your self-respect.
Let's say you and I make a little side wager: if I win this contest, we go out together.
Oh never.
Never, never, never, never, never, never.
Good luck, Alex.
Hold on, Nardo.
Let's talk turkey here.
Uh, let's hear it.
Uh, what's a date with you worth?
Five hundred dollars.
Five hundred dollars?
Mm-hmm.
The best date of my life only cost me 20.
And that included the room and the closed-circuit TV.
I knew that would shut him up.
You're on.
Shall we shake on it?
Okay, gentlemen, start your engines.
Nardo!
My colors.
Okay, now, is everybody ready?
Yeah, ready, ready.
Okay-- Alex?
Ready when you are, Latka.
Okay.
On your mark get set one for the money two for the show one potato, two potato Latka, we're running out of gas here!
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Go!
BOBBY : Alex, Alex.
Louie just got his eighth fare.
Eight fares in one hour?
Eight fares in one cab.
How you doing?
You know how I'm doing.
I had one fare, and the guy stiffed me.
Uh-oh, oh, I think I see somebody.
Let's go, girls.
Where are we going?
Hello there.
Hi.
Where to?
We're going to the movies.
Could you be a little bit more specific?
Oh, well, we haven't decided what movie to see yet.
I wanted to see The Muppet Movie.
Perfect choice.
I can't stand that little frog.
I want to go to a revival of, uh, The Sound of Music.
One of my favorites-- Sound of Music.
We've seen it 12 times.
No, no.
You can't see that one too many times.
Look, uh, please, uh, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm in kind of a hurry tonight, so can you make your decision, please?
You got to pick last time.
And I made an excellent choice.
So, what?
Girls, girls, girls, come on.
Nuns, nuns, Sisters, Sisters Look, now, Sisters, look, I'm a nice guy, I really am, and I'm gonna hate myself tomorrow, but I'm trying to win a contest here tonight, and I-I would really wish Would you get out of my cab?
Get out of the cab, please.
No, please, both of you.
Get out of the cab.
Please, out!
What am I doing?
I'm turning into Louie De Palma here.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Get back in, get back in.
Come here.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I lost my head.
Uh, please, forgive me.
That's all right.
Look, uh, please, I-I'll take you anywhere you want to go.
Just tell me, where do you want to go?
Your choice.
Well, anywhere but The Sound of Music.
What's wrong with The Sound of Music?
I do not want to see that movie Pick a movie!
Muppets!
Muppets!
Muppets.
Hey, everybody, I just broke 40 bucks.
Louie just topped a hundred.
Hundred bucks?
Wow.
Hi, there, where you going?
Oh, no, no, excuse me, no, please, um Wait a second, now, um English?
Do you speak English?
Eng-li-shi?
Oh!
No, no, no, no.
: Where do you want to go?
Why am I talking so loud?
No, no, that's Chinese.
I only speak Oh, oh, that's- that's clever.
Okay, I know where that is.
Good.
Oh, my God.
Hey, don't you listen to Karl Malden?
No, no, no.
Look, look, I don't need this much money.
I-I You don't know that, do you?
I could take everything you got.
Wow!
There's more money here than I need.
More to I could beat a whole herd of Louies.
Hey, uh, you don't mind if I rob you blind, cheat you of all your money, and, uh, make you penniless, do you?
Elaine, hello?
ELAINE : Yes, Alex.
Oh, listen, I think I need your help.
I, uh, have a Chinese gentleman in my cab who doesn't speak a word of English, and I think he's just in from Hong Kong, and he's a little confused about our currency.
I mean, he's trying to give me what looks like to go on a two-mile trip.
ELAINE : All right!
Well, I guess it's a tough choice.
Oh, uh Here we are, sir.
That's where you want to go.
Well, uh that about covers it, I guess.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, thank you very much, no.
I don't want No, please  No, no, sir.
Look, no, no, I can't take that.
No, no, no, sir, I can't I can't even take this.
Look, uh, you, uh I take you on short ride.
You give me much money for short ride.
Now I'm talking like Tonto.
Tonto-- Hi-ho, Silver!
No, no I I can't take it.
I can't take it.
Here, that's for you.
This is enough.
This is for me, see?
Just five-- five bucks.
Oh  Yeah.
Alex?
Yeah, Elaine?
You didn't take the money, did you?
No, I didn't, Elaine.
But I did learn something about myself tonight, Elaine.
No matter how competitive I might be, when it comes right down to it, there's a quality in me that prevails over everything, let me tell you.
Your stupidity.
You got it.
Hey, driver.
Oh, yeah.
That's the U.N. Oh, so it is.
This is the second time we've passed it.
I didn't want you to miss it.
You're trying to run up this fare.
You're crazy.
No, I'm not.
I'm Inspector Ryan, New York Taxi Commission.
Pull it over.
I'm writing you out a summons, mister.
Let me see your hack license.
There!
Is that your full name-- Tony Banta?
Yeah.
Hey, this sure doesn't look like your picture.
It was taken when I was sick and stupid.
I didn't see any ID from you big guy.
Here you are.
Are these your kids?
Yep.
Reminds me of a chimp act I once saw.
You know, I'm going to see to it that you never drive a cab in this city again.
In fact, I'm going to confiscate your license.
Eh.
Now, get this hack right back in the garage, Banta.
Give my regards, and a banana, to your family.
You know, I'm going to love seeing you hung out to dry, wise guy.
Bobby Wheeler, reporting for duty.
Alex: $106.40!
De Palma: $147.
Look, Alex, you've only got another hour and you're way behind.
Oh, now I'm being hailed down by a little old lady with eight bags of groceries.
Oh, no, Alex, she'll take forever.
You-you'll have to carry her bags and she'll only want to go a couple of blocks.
Aw, forget it-- this contest is over.
Besides, she's waving her vegetables at me.
I'm afraid I've got lots of bags.
Yeah, I'm afraid you do, too.
That's all right.
I'll-I'll load your I'll load your groceries for you.
I hope this won't put you out.
Not at all.
Here you go.
These groceries are for my friends.
They can't get around as well as I. Ah-hah.
Now, that one is for Ethel, who lives in the Bronx.
Bronx, huh?
Mm-hmm.
And those are for Cora who lives in Brooklyn.
Brooklyn, huh?
Mm-hmm.
And that's for Virginia out on Long Island.
Long Island?
Mm-hmm.
And who is this for?
Oh, those are mine.
And where do you live?
I live in New Jersey.
New Jersey?
!
I hope you have a lot of gas.
Well, if I run out, I'll push.
It can't be.
It is.
The De Palma luck strikes again.
Mm.
Just one thing could make this perfect.
This is my first time in New York.
That's it.
Um  It'll be $22.50, please.
No, it's not.
What are you talking about?
I've been counting the clicks on the meter.
Clicks?
It now reads exactly six dollars.
You're a very dishonest person.
I think I'd better warn you-- I happen to be a very big, muscular guy.
Then you must be talking out of your belly button.
Here's your six dollars.
You got a lot of nerve calling yourself handicapped!
Okay, Alex, Louie, time's up.
Bring 'em in.
What's with her?
She hasn't said a word in three hours.
Okay, Jeff, Louie's total is $212.30.
Ooh!
Well, Elaine You don't mind me calling you Elaine?
Don't think I can't be tender.
Sure, I play the tough guy sometimes but I think you'll find that underneath I can be warm and thrilling.
And, yes a little vulnerable.
Would it spoil this moment for you if I threw up?
Hey, Louie, you haven't won yet, you know.
Come on, count this up.
Ooh, yeah.
Oh, oh, Tony, lie if you have to.
One ninety-seven.
* He wins, he wins!
Nyah!
Hey, listen, folks, I'm sorry.
I, uh, I did my best.
I Nyah!
Hey, Alex.
Hey, Alex, you did great, man, and I'll tell you I think you're taking this loss really well.
Thanks, Tony.
Get your hands off me.
Hey, what's that?
My tips.
Well, uh, uh, don't tips count?
I don't know.
Hey, we said the guy who brings in the most money wins and tips are money.
Oh, that's right!
I-I've seen them.
I know that for a fact-- it's money.
Oh, no.
No, no.
Tips don't count!
It's what's on the meter that counts.
We never said tips don't count, Louie.
We never said they do, either.
Hey, hey, listen, if I'd have thought for a second that tips counted, I could've pulled in more than Admit it, Louie, You must be more nauseating on the road than you are in the garage.
Okay, I got  I got you beat, Louie!
No, no, no!
No, Rieger, tips don't count!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Now, listen, we all got something at stake here, right?
Now, the only fair thing to do is get, like, an objective bystander you know, to-to settle the question.
Somebody who didn't bet on the race.
Everybody bet on this race.
Tips don't count.
Not everybody.
You want a bite?
Latka.
Latka who loves me.
That's right.
Latka who fears me.
Right.
Latka who owes his job to me.
Yes.
Good, old, impartial Latka.
Now, hold it right there, Louie.
You can't threaten Latka's job.
Now, look, I'm willing to let Latka decide, and I'll stand by it, but if you put this kind of pressure on him, this whole fiasco's off, you understand?
Okay, Latka.
No no no pressure.
Decide away.
Come on, Latka, is it Alex or Louie?
Be impartial, Latka.
Impartial.
Okay.
Well I tell you I tell you something.
You know, I I do love Louie.
And Louie loves Latka.
Thank you very much.
And I, also, I do love Alex, too.
And Alex loves Latka.
Yeah, she's right.
Thank you very much.
You know, this this is a wonderful place to work.
Thank you very much.
Get over here!
And decide!
Decide what?
About about the contest!
Oh.
Why, what is the question?
Do tips count?
Oh, of course they do.
All right, all right listen up here.
Okay, listen up here for a second.
I just want to say one thing.
I hope you all die.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Hey, guys.
You're never gonna believe who I just had as a fare.
Who?
Neil Armstrong.
Oh, yeah?
Neil Armstrong!
Imagine, the first guy who ever walked on the moon sitting in my cab.
Wow!
I'm really impressed.
Hey, that's a great fare, Tony.
Where did you take him?
The unemployment office.
Yeah, you know, they cut back on the space program.
He's a little down on his luck.
It turns out he couldn't even pay the fare.
Hey, which was lucky for me, 'cause he gave me something even more valuable than money.
A rock?
This ain't no rock.
This is a piece of the moon.
He had a whole bag of them.
What's the matter?
We're jealous.
Uh, Tony, di-did it ever occur to you that this guy that said he was Neil Armstrong might have been a phony?
Oh, Bobby, if he was a phony, where did he get a piece of the moon?
Yeah, where'd he get a piece of the moon?
Okay, listen up, everybody.
I just come down from McKenzie's office, and he had my butt for breakfast.
It seems somebody sacked out in his office last night.
I mean, if it was one of you guys, I want you to just come right out and say so.
Now, trust me on this.
I'm not going to fire you.
I'm not going to make a big deal about this.
I just want to briefly torture you with a soldering iron.
Don't trust him.
I think it's a trick.
Now, come on, I got to know who slept in the garage last night.
If any of you have any idea who it might have been, just say so.
Latka!
Latka!
Is occupied.
"It's occupied"?
Get out here!
Get out here!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get that thing out of your mouth!
Now, what's the big idea?
You got toothpaste in your mouth?
Swallow it!
: Uh-uh!
I said swallow it.
Mmm!
Not bad.
All right now, last night the cleaning lady went into Mr. McKenzie's office and she found a strange man sleeping on the sofa.
How did she know I was strange?
You got me in big trouble with the boss, Latka, and I'm not gonna stand for this.
Now take it easy, Louie.
There's got to be an explanation.
Latka, why were you sleeping in the boss's office last night?
'Cause I live here now.
I'm satisfied.
Look, I'm going to tell you this once.
You cannot live in this garage.
You can work here, you can sweat here, you can even die here, but you cannot live here.
Now, get all of this stuff, and get out of here before I kill you.
Louie  why don't you take a nice, deep breath and never let it out?
Come sit over here, Latka.
Come on, sit down here.
Now, Latka, what happened to your apartment, huh?
Well, they-they tore the building down.
Tore the building down?
Why?
Because it would not burn.
Oh.
Well, Latka, if you were living in such a crummy place, why didn't you come to one of us?
I not want to bother you.
Then you should have gone to your ambassador and have him help you find a place.
But ambassador was my roommate.
Hey, Alex, what do you say, Al?
Hey, did you find Latka a place yet?
No, not even close.
There's not much in his price range.
Aw, you didn't find anything?
Well, we had one offer that Latka almost took-- one room for one night including roommate and complimentary cocktail.
You better find him something quick, Rieger, 'cause I already sent his things on ahead.
On ahead where?
On ahead out in the street.
What?
Louie, I want to report an outrage.
You let some terrible person come in here and right under your face you let him take all my stuff, put it on the street.
I did no such thing, Latka.
I resent that.
I'll have you know I threw that stuff out myself.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
Hey, Louie, why don't you lay off, huh?
Latka's got no place else to go.
No, no, is okay.
I found apartment today.
Yeah?
You took one of those places we saw yesterday?
Eh, no, no.
This morning I went for a walk, and I saw the sign say, it say, uh, "for rent".
So I looked, and I like what I see.
Hey, Latka, that's great.
You did it yourself.
man.
Yeah, that's terrific.
Fantastic.
Yeah, but the manager say one thing I don't understand.
He want to put me on a leash.
"Lease".
Lease, Latka, lease.
Oh Yeah.
You know, Alex, I think you better go talk to this guy.
I mean, you know, some tenement landlords, they take advantage of people.
Yeah, I think you're right.
Latka, maybe you'd better show me that apartment.
Okay.
Okay, but what time-what time does the bus outside leave?
We don't need a bus, we're gonna drive.
I know, but it's parked on my sport coat.
Oh.
Not bad, hey?
Latka.
Yes?
Latka.
You don't like it?
Latka!
Why do you keep saying my name over and over?
Latka!
Oh, man, give me a break.
Latka!
Latka, this is a terrible mistake.
How much is this place costing you?
$3,000?
It's all right, I have money in savings.
How much?
$3,000.
No, Latka.
When they say they mean 3,000 every month.
Oh, what am I going to do next month?
I was going to ask you that.
I better start saving again.
Can you believe people actually live like this all the time?
The closest we'll ever get to a world like this is the curb outside the building.
Not true, Alex.
You can come and visit here anytime.
You can even live here with me, if you like.
Well, hello, Mr. Gravas.
Oh, hello.
See?
It comes with a maid.
Oh, yeah.
I thought you weren't moving in till tomorrow.
Mm, yeah, but I am showing my friend to the apartment.
Oh, well, I'm here to serve you.
Oh, good.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yes, nik-nik.
No, no!
Thank you very much.
Latka, Latka Latka, you're really in over your head, you know that?
You're in over everybody's head.
These apartments are built for people like the Rockefellers, the Vanderbilts, the Bee Gees.
But Alex, I want it.
Latka, you're throwing your money away.
I got to get you out of this.
I really got to get you out.
Hello, can I speak to Mr., uh, Martin, please?
Good-bye, couch.
Good-bye, carpet.
Good-bye, lush contemporary decor.
Latka, I'm sorry, but we just can't Hello.
Uh, yes, can I speak to Mr. Martin?
Mr. Martin?
Oh, yes, I'll hold on.
* Uh, yes, hello, Mr. Martin?
Uh, my name is Alex Rieger.
I'm calling you about the penthouse apartment you rented to a Mr. Latka Gravas.
Well, I just wanted to say that, uh, we-we'll take it.
Yes, and thank you very much.
* Hey, hey, hey, ze-be-de-ba * Ah, hey, hey, hey * Ze-be-de-ba, ze-be-de-ba * * Hey, hey, hey, hey * Ze-be-de-ba, ze-be-de-ba * Excuse me, Mr. Gravas?
Oh I'm sorry to bother you.
Oh, it's all right, it's just the news.
Oh.
So, are you ready for nik-nik?
No.
No nik-nik.
Is there anything else I can get you?
Eh, no, thank you.
Okay.
Mr. Rieger, is there anything I can get for you?
Uh, yes, my swizzle stick is a little limp.
Oh, very well, sir.
Mr. Tony Banta.
You know but does she have to do that every time you leave, come back?
Every time?
Well, if it embarrasses you, do what I do.
What is it?
Don't leave.
Hi, Tony!
Hey, Latka.
Is there anything I can get for you, Mr. Banta?
Oh, no.
You know, I hate to be waited on.
All right.
Hey, yo, but, uh.
while you're up, you could draw me a brew.
All right.
Hey, make it that foreign kind.
You know, with the little picture of the mountain village on the label.
Hey, yeah, and put it in a frosted mug.
Okay.
Hey, make it two.
Save yourself a trip.
And some peanuts.
Oh, shelled or unshelled?
Surprise me.
"A gentleman who needs no introduction "an artist in a world of philistines "our last hope for the life of the theater "a man who bestrides this world like a colossus ladies and gentlemen, the legend we call Robert Wheeler".
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You're too kind.
Isn't this some place?
So what do you think?
I think that's your 14th grand entrance of the day.
Hey, Latka, Latka, can I bring a date over here tonight?
Okeydokey, Bobby.
Oh, oh, oh, Bobby, hey.
What, what?
I was thinking about bringing Cathy over here tonight.
Hey, well, Tony, this is, like, a big place, you know.
We can both use it, you know?
Yeah, but, uh, I don't think that's gonna work out because we both want to end up in the same room if you, uh, know what I mean?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, oh, yeah.
Oh, I know, I know, let's flip for it, okay?
Okay, do you have coins?
Yeah, I got one over here.
Here.
All right, um, y-you flip it, I'll call it.
All right, ready?
Yeah.
Heads.
I win.
I get the game room.
Right, uh, okay.
I I guess I'll just have to figure out something to do in the master bedroom.
I love that Jacuzzi.
Oh, I love every wrinkle on every toe.
Oh, thanks so much, Latka, for sharing this with us.
You know, in my country, everyone shares with everyone.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Otherwise they shoot you.
Oh, I'm so relaxed.
I can't even remember what tension and unhappiness feel like.
There's a Mr. Louie De Palma here to see you.
I just remembered.
De Palma?
I don't recall a De Palma.
Send him packing.
Don't let him in.
Don't let him in.
Don't let him in.
No.
I'm terribly sorry, sir, but you can't come in.
That's what you think.
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd drop around to see you.
So this is the apartment you're all talking about, eh?
Inga-- suds.
You know, we don't have to take this.
All Louie's gonna do is try and step on our good time.
Yeah.
I say we make Louie leave right now.
No, no, Bobby, this is my house and Louie is my guest, and I want him to stay.
Besides, what negative thing can he possibly say about the greatest apartment in New York City?
That's true.
I wonder.
This is a nice apartment.
You're going to feel like killing yourselves when you got to leave.
Quick, get some boards and nails.
Are you kidding?
Our booze is in there.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
Elaine, let him out.
Okay, I can tell when I'm not wanted.
I can take a hint.
You don't have to get mechanical.
By the way you're out of scotch.
Get him!
You know, uh, Louie's right.
I am gonna miss this place.
Oh, me, too, Tone.
Hey, hey, hey, come on, stop that.
No more "I'm going to miss this place" talk.
Now, don't worry about it.
We still got four whole days to enjoy it.
Besides, believe me, four days will go by soon enough.
In fact, they'll zip by.
Boy, am I going to miss this place.
You're going to miss this place?
Do you know that right now my kids are down at the swimming pool taking swimming lessons, and in the afternoon, they have tennis lessons, and the elevator operator is teaching them French.
Damn it!
We got to stay another month.
Hey, I know.
I know.
We'll have a rent party, huh?
What's a rent party?
Well, I used to have them all the time when I was poor, you know?
It's um, it's like, what you do, is, is you have a singles party here and you charge about five or ten bucks a head.
That's right.
We could get some of our passengers.
You know, a lot of them are from out of town.
They're always looking for something to do.
I mean, a mixer at an address like this can't miss.
Terrific idea.
Hey, I ain't making no promises, but maybe I can get Neil Armstrong here.
Boy, you could get high on Brut in this place.
Hey, Bobby, we got a problem here.
Oh, really?
Yeah, nobody's dancing.
What happened to all the girls?
There are no girls.
The maid's in hiding under the pool table.
Well, do you want me to go round up some chicks for you?
Tony, it takes you a month to round up one.
Oh, yeah.
Boy, you know, some of the women around here are real dogs.
You know, this party stinks.
Yeah, well, it's, uh  I guess it's a little slow but, you know, some of the best parties start off kind of slow and, uh There's no women here.
Yeah, well  maybe because of the gas shortage they're all coming in one car.
No, I'm just joking, just joking.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I say if something soft and warm doesn't walk into this room soon, I'm going to demand my money back, right?
Yeah.
Come on.
Yeah!
How about a loaf of freshly baked bread?
No, hold it right there.
Now, look, this kind of talk gets me a little angry, you know.
Okay, so some of you are upset because there aren't many women.
All right.
All of you are upset because there aren't many women here.
All right, all right.
All of you are upset because there aren't any women here.
So what's the big disaster, huh?
I mean, is that so bad?
No, no, come on.
When we were kids, we didn't need women, uh, to have fun, did we?
I mean, we, uh, we played baseball and, uh, football and tug-of-war.
For some reason, when we get older, uh, we get tangled up with women.
All we can think about is women, women, women, girls, girls.
Now, look, no, no, we have a chance to make new friends here tonight.
I mean, you know, develop comradeship, man-to-man.
Personally, I'm going to try to get to know each and every one of you here tonight.
Oh, really?
Is that so?
Then I'm gonna go out and chase down some chicks, of course.
I want my money back.
Elaine.
Oh, my God.
Uh Elaine, we're in trouble.
You're in trouble.
Hey, Elaine, come in, meet the guys.
Elaine, Elaine, they want their money back.
You're the only one that can get us out of this.
Now, now, why don't you just go in there and mingle around a little bit, talk, you know, keep their minds off their money.
Hey, think of your kids' French lessons.
Think of 31 fun-filled days.
Oh, yeah, yeah, well, I I guess it wouldn't hurt to mingle a little, right?
It doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt.
Yeah.
Okay.
Mingle, mingle, mingle Uh, hi, everybody.
Hi, Elaine!
Well, um, uh let's see, what can we do to make this a more fun-filled evening?
Any suggestions?
Uh, no, uh, music!
How about some music?
Tony?
Tony?
That's a great idea, great idea.
Good.
Okay.
Great idea.
A little beat now.
Well, uh would anybody like to dance?
Yeah!
Fellas, fellas, fellas.
Just-just step back a little.
Give her some room.
No, Elaine will dance, we will watch.
Don, watch.
Elaine will dance, Don will watch.
Don, see Elaine dance?
Yeah.
Dance, Elaine.
Oh Now you want your money back?
I want everybody's money back.
Elaine  Look at this!
Oh, look at this.
Hey, come on, now.
Elaine!
Look at this!
All right!
Yeah!
Look, take it easy.
There's your ten, now, there's yours.
I'm glad you could come tonight.
It's been a fun-filled evening.
Thank you so much.
Well, that's that.
No more French lessons.
No more water bed.
No more game room.
Louie was right-- we are losers.
No, no, Latka wrong.
No one with a friend like you can be called a loser.
You gave us a great month, Latka, thanks.
Aw, Latka, don't feel so bad.
Listen to me.
Tomorrow we're all going to go out and find you a great place to live.
Are you okay?
Yes, I-I'm okay.
But I have been thinking, and I have this one thought.
You know, for me to live in a place like this has been a miracle.
And someday, when things are bad, and I have no money and no food, and I'm depressed, I will think about this month that I lived here, and I will feel even worse.
Hey, what do you say we, uh we leave and let Latka spend the last night in his own apartment.
Oh, yeah, good idea.
Good-bye.
See you, Latka.
Bye-bye.
Thanks a lot, Latka.
Good night.
See you.
Thanks.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye apartment.
Good-bye, apartment.
I'm going to miss you.
Good-bye, panoramic view.
Mr. Gravas?
Yes?
Nik-nik?
Oh, thank you very much.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Bobby, I really appreciate you taking the time to console me.
Oh, that's okay, that's okay.
Must be a real drag for you.
Now, come on, you got to look on the bright side of things, huh?
Now, look at me.
I was dropped from the same stupid soap opera, right?
You don't see me crying, do you?
What do you see me doing, huh?
Driving a cab!
A beer, please.
Oh, excuse me a second, Joyce, okay?
Thank you.
Hi, Alex.
Hi, Bob.
How are you?
Okay.
Am I glad to see you.
Yeah?
Listen there's this girl I-- lady-- you know, that I think you'd really like to meet.
I'd like to introduce Oh, Bob, thanks, but no thanks.
The last lady you introduced me to kept talking about how all the world's problems could be solved if everybody practiced nude skydiving.
Thank you very much.
But Alex, I mean, really, you're going you're going to like Joyce, believe me.
Bob, no, no, no.
Bob, please, will you?
She's really nice.
Oh, Joyce?
Joyce, I'd like you to meet my friend and fellow cab driver Alex Rieger.
Alex, this is my friend and coactor Joyce Rogers.
Hello.
How do you do?
I believe this is yours.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What?
You realize that, in some primitive cultures, that would mean we're married?
Well, you two don't need me hanging around, do you?
What are you talking about?
Bob, what are you doing?
Alex, Alex, please, listen.
I got to go.
I got to go.
So, uh tell me, you cry here often?
Believe it or not, I'm crying like this because I just got fired.
Oh.
That's one good thing about being a cab driver: You never have to worry about getting fired from a good job.
For eight years, I played Blanche Bain, the villain, on For Better, For Worse.
I was voted the most despised woman on daytime TV three years in a row.
Hey, hey, hey.
Congratulations.
Suddenly they decide I'm a little too old to destroy happy homes.
No kidding?
Hey, listen, if I ever have a happy home, you have a standing invitation to come and destroy it anytime you like.
I'll remember that.
Ah  Hey, come on, come on.
Joyce Joyce, Joyce.
Look, the way I see it, you have two choices.
I mean, you can stay here and feel sorry for yourself or you can look this thing square in the eye and say, "I'm not going to let this get me down!
"At least not until I've had dinner "with that swashbuckling ne'er-do-well Alex Rieger".
Do you often lose control like that?
No.
I guess I must have meant it.
Well, in that case, let's have dinner.
What a great idea.
Come on, let's go.
Wait.
What's wrong with this place?
Mario's?
No, you don't want to eat here.
Why not?
You see those framed documents on the wall?
Well, those are subpoenas from the Board of Health.
This is my winter home.
Wow.
Where's your summer home?
I open the windows.
Well, Alex, it's, uh, very nice.
Yes.
I'm kind of proud of it.
I've decorated it myself.
Really?
Yep.
That's very interesting.
Oh, you like that?
That's my favorite.
The vase is from the Ming Dynasty.
The Ming dynasty?
Yeah.
The Ming Dynasty.
That's a little shop down on 17th street.
Oh Alex, there's something I got to tell you.
You're a man!
I just don't think you should get involved with me.
I'm trouble.
I'm a basket case.
And I just happen to be an extraordinarily stable human being.
Isn't it fortunate that we should meet?
One like you and one like me?
I'm serious.
So am I. Okay, let's make an agreement right now.
while we both have clear heads, that we're not going to get involved.
I mean, we're just two people out on a nice date.
Oh, right.
That sounds like a lot more fun anyway.
So tell me something about yourself.
I mean, have you been married or?
Oh, yes.
How'd it turn out?
So far, terrific.
Dear, I have company.
Don't come out for a while.
She stays in there all the time.
God, you make me laugh.
Come here and kiss me.
Kiss you?
You just made me promise not to get involved.
We didn't shake on it.
Right, and I had my fingers crossed all the time.
Oh, this is  It'll never work.
This is crazy.
Crazy?
Right.
Who'd want to do a thing like that?
Lips touching lips!
Yuck!
What a terrible thought.
Alex, I'm no good for you.
I mean, you're a terrific guy and I don't want to hurt you Okay, fine.
fine.
So what we'll do is just have a couple of glasses of wine, and talk.
That's very wise.
That requires a trip to the wine cellar.
To the wine cellar.
Well, but Alex you do kind of sense some kind of attraction between us.
No, only a strong animal one.
This could be very dangerous, Mr. Rieger.
I think we have a definite problem here.
Well, the only problem that I can see is that you seem to be running hot and cold, and I seem to be running hot and hotter.
Every time you say something funny I want to kiss you.
Oh I wish you didn't tell me that.
I'm going to be very self-conscious now because, every time I make a joke, you're going to think I'm just doing it to try to get a A priest and a rabbi walked into a bar The priest said, "So, rabbi, what will you be drinking now"?
And the rabbi said, "So what's it to you"?
Do you mind if we just jump to the punch line?
Hello, everybody.
Hi, Alex.
Hey, Jim, how are you, Jim?
Louie, how's tricks?
Ooh, somebody's in good spirits today.
Oh, that's the reason I caught myself whistling while shaving.
You wild, impetuous fool.
Yeah.
And, just before that, I bumped into a chair and told the chair I was sorry.
I guess I'm in trouble when I start talking to the furniture, right?
No, you're in trouble when it goes to the door and scratches to go out.
Well I got to go.
See you later.
So long, Jim.
Hey, Alex, Does the good mood have anything to do with Joyce?
No, Tony.
He's just thrilled about being a cab driver.
Oh, I get that way myself sometimes.
Is it Joyce?
Well, we've been getting along quite well.
Actually, we've been getting along very well.
Actually, she's one of the most interesting women I've ever met.
Hey, that's great, Alex.
These have been the most interesting two weeks.
I mean, they've been fantastic!
There's always something interesting about her.
I mean, you know, when she's happy, she's the happiest person in the world.
And, when she's sad, she could break your heart.
I mean, she goes full out, you know?
It's like being on a roller coaster and hoping the ride never ends, if you know what I mean.
Latka!
What do you think you're doing?
Listening to my friend Alex talking about his girlfriend.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Yes.
He's talking about his girlfriend?
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you supposed to be working?
Oh, but this is where you are wrong.
I'm supposed to be on the coffee break.
The coffee break.
Oh, okay, all right.
You just go right ahead there and you have yourself a coffee break.
Okay, I will.
All right, you do what you like.
If you want to be un-American, it's up to you.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean, "un-American"?
Well, Latka, do you think that, when George Washington was crossing the Delaware, he said, "Ooh!
We got to stop the boat.
I got to have a coffee break"?
No.
Well, do you think that Abraham Lincoln, when he was delivering the Gettysburg address, he said to the guys, "Oh!
I got to stop.
I got to have a coffee break"?
No, I guess not.
All right.
You think, when Ike was figuring out what day is supposed to be D-Day, he said to the other generals, "Hey, guys, I got to have a cup of java"?
Hmm?
Hmm?
I'm sorry, Louie.
Please forgive me.
I'm sorry, Louie.
You are right.
Good boy.
No more eat, no more sleep.
You just get in those cabs and work.
Yeah, all right.
I'm sorry.
You red pinkie!
Alex, hi!
Joyce!
Hey, Joyce!
Hey, Bobby, hi.
Joyce, these are my friends: Elaine Nardo, Tony Banta, Nice to meet you.
You know Bobby.
I think there's somebody else here.
You don't want to meet him.
Hello, there.
Joyce Rogers, this is Louie De Palma.
Hi.
Don't let this go to your head, but you could have your way with me.
You're right.
I didn't want to meet him.
Yeah.
So what's up?
What happened?
Well, I came by because I got some great news.
I called you at home but I guess you'd already left.
Yeah, yeah, yeah?
What is it?
What is it?
I think I might have a job.
Oh, Joyce, is it a part?
It's a lead in a TV series.
The problem is the where.
It's in L.A. And I'd have to move out there.
Ah.
Uh-huh.
I see.
Well, it's a real big decision.
What do you think I should do?
I don't know.
What do you think you should do?
Well, I'd prefer to stay in New York, but I guess I don't have any choice.
Hmm.
Well, I got to go pick up a script at my agent's.
We'll talk about it later, okay?
Yeah, sure.
Bye.
Nice to meet you.
Bye, Joyce.
Bye, Joyce.
Well that's that.
Tough break, Alex.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I should have told you this before, but she's a little flaky, you know?
You know, Alex, I know it hurts but, um, in all honesty, I don't think you two were right for each other.
Yeah, she wasn't that great anyway, Alex.
Just forget about her, Alex.
I got a better idea.
I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Great idea.
What a pro.
Perfect.
Aw It's never going to work.
Hello!
Hi.
Wow.
The place looks great!
Yeah.
What's the occasion?
It's Thursday night.
Ah.
Yeah, Thursdays have always held a special magic for me.
Oh, all this is for my new job, right, Alex?
Oh.
So I guess you've decided to take the job, huh?
I guess so.
I didn't want to make my final decision till I talked it over with you.
Mmm.
That's very good to hear.
Alex, you look great in a suit.
Well, it's Thursday.
This is my Thursday suit.
Wouldn't be Thursday without this suit.
What's all this about?
Thursday.
Joyce?
Hmm?
Uh, we've known each other for two weeks now and, uh, I know it's not a very long time but, I think, in those two weeks, I've gotten to know you better than I've known some people forever.
I've seen all of your moods.
I love them all.
Joyce, you've brought life into my life.
You're a little crazy, but I can live with that.
In fact, I'd love to.
Oh, God, Alex, you're not proposing, are you?
Please tell me you're not proposing.
Proposing?
My heavens, no.
I'm running for governor, and this is my way of asking you for your vote.
I hope I don't have this much trouble with everybody in the campaign.
Alex, I thought we'd gone over all this the first night.
Oh, yes, Joyce, you're right.
I don't know what came over me just now.
It was just a whim, really.
A whim?
You can't tell me this is a whim.
You've got candles and flowers and a bell.
A bell?
No, don't!
Just forget that bell.
Alex, believe me, I would make a terrible wife.
Yes, yes, I know.
We've been all over that.
And I-I-II don't know why I proposed.
I mean, just forget the proposal, you know?
Maybe it was just the best two weeks of my life that clouded my thinking there for a moment.
I was thinking that we had something special, that's all.
We have.
No, I mean something long-lasting.
It's been two weeks.
That long?
Oh, my God.
You're right.
I'm tired of you.
No, I withdraw the proposal.
Can I pour you some champagne before I chug it all myself?
Alex, what I think we should do What I think we should do is just go our separate ways, right?
Alex, listen to me.
No.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Will you listen to me?
I heard all you have Damn it!
Will you listen to me?
!
Okay, I will listen, but you better be quick, because you're not the only girl I'm proposing to tonight.
How can you be so glib?
I mean, you're treating this like it means nothing.
All right.
Okay, you're the actress.
Tell me how I'm supposed to do rejection, please.
Oh Okay, Alex Okay.
Oh, Alex, what possible reason could you have to want to marry me?
I have the audacity to believe that I'm good for you.
Oh.
Oh, right, I forgot.
You're the stable one.
Forgot about that.
Slipped right out of my mind.
Well, the fact of the matter is, Joyce, I happen to be a fairly down-to-earth, rational kind of guy.
Yes.
We've known each other two weeks, and you want to get married, and you're down-to-earth.
Please don't take this the wrong way, but I think you're crazier than I am.
I mean, we barely know each other and you're hearing wedding bells!
I told you, not the bell!
They're here to, uh They came to pick up my violins.
Thanks.
Thanks, fellas.
Do they have to go back to the shop?
Oh, that's terrible.
I guess they need a couple of tubes, that's all.
Thank you very much.
No, no, I don't want a loaner.
No, I don't need a loaner.
Be better to do without the violins for a week.
Thanks, guys.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Well, where was I?
Oh, yes, I was telling you what a rational, down-to-earth kind of human being I was.
Oh, Alex I'm sorry.
I really am so sorry.
You're sorry?
Oh, what the hell.
We're fighting because we care too much, and we're breaking up because we don't care enough.
When do you have to go to L.A.?
Three days.
How long will it take you to pack?
A day.
That means we have two whole days to say good-bye.
Starting now.
Would you follow me?
What was that?
What?
It came from inside that door.
No, I didn't hear anything.
Alex No.
There's nothing in there.
Open that door.
You don't want Open that door.
Now.
Well, if you insist.
Will you marry me?
No!
Just checking!
You okay?
Hmm?
Yeah, of course.
Why?
I just thought maybe you'd want to talk about it.
Talk about what?
The fact that Joyce left today.
Oh, was it today?
My, how time flies.
Oh poor Alex.
I know He shouldn't keep it all bottled up like that.
I tried to talk to him, too, but he just clammed up on me.
Poor Alex.
Let me give it a try.
You?
I am a man of the cloth.
What do you mean?
That "Church of the Peaceful" stuff?
Hey, hey.
Just because the draft ended doesn't mean I can't save a soul now and then.
Hey, Jim, are you sure you can handle this by yourself?
Why don't you take Bobby with you?
Okay.
Come on, Bobby.
Give me a hand.
Sure.
What's up?
We got to help Alex.
Hi, Alex.
Hi, Jim.
Hi, Alex.
Hi, Latka.
Alex we have to talk to you.
Oh?
Wait a minute, Jim.
I think, if this is personal, I think we should talk alone.
No, no, I want Alex to hear.
I mean the three of us alone.
Come on, Alex, let's go into the tool room.
Come on.
Tool room?
Yeah.
Okay.
Sit down and, uh listen to me.
Every time you get knocked down, you got to get right back up again.
That's right.
Now, don't ask me why.
That's the way it is.
You got to forget yesterday and forget tomorrow.
There's only today, and you got to get everything out of it that you can.
He know what he's talking about.
Life is like an ice cream cone.
You got to eat it when you get it.
That's right.
Got to eat it fast.
Because, if you don't, it's going to melt all over your hand and down your arm.
That's no good.
Do you want to go through life licking your arm?
Uh No.
I know I don't.
Me, too.
So live, live, live!
And never let an empty moment go by.
That's right.
Hallelujah.
You are right, Jim.
You are right.
I am going to live very good, and then I'm going to report back to you.
I'm going to to be good, and live my life the most I can, and I'll always eat my ice cream, and all my problems are solved.
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
You should listen to him.
He knows what he talking about.
Thank you very much.
I knew I could help him.
Yes, that was very nice what you did for him, Jim.
Very nice.
Well Bobby's had it pretty rough.
Trying to make it as a boxer, and raise the two kids By the way, how are you doing?
Oh, fine, fine, Jim.
In fact, I'm doing better by the minute, I'm sure.
Things going okay at the gallery?
Couldn't be better, Jim.
Okeydoke.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
What's Latka listening to?
There's a New York radio station that broadcasts in Latka's language every day for a couple of hours.
Oh, it must be nice to keep in touch with home.
Bet he loves it.
Hey, Latka?
What?
What is that-- the news?
Yeah, it's the news.
Just the usual thing-- they devalued the broknik and the royal family is vacationing in Calcutta and oh, Ippi Dongpres just set the new indoor pole-vaulting record for my country.
He jumped 12 feet.
Ah.
That's not so good, you know.
the world record.
Yes, but remember the National Sports Arena has a ten-foot ceiling.
Ooh.
In that case, I'm impressed.
On the lighter side, it seems that a farmer made a mistake in the dark and tried to milk a billy goat.
What are you going to do?
Top of the morning!
It's 5:00 p.m., clam brain.
I think the boss is starting to warm up to me.
You just never know what Dylan's going to do next.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
What's the matter?
What happened?
What happened?
Adi-feebie!
Adi-feebie!
Adi-feebie!
Adi-feebie!
Adi-feebie!
Where the hell are you going?
You don't know what adi-feebie means.
So what?
Oh, no, The revolution!
The revolution has begun.
There is fighting in the streets.
The people have taken up arms.
Oh, no!
What am I going to do?
My country, my friends, my family!
Latka, Latka, let me take you home.
We'll try to get in touch with your family.
It's okay, Louie?
You bet, Latka.
But this counts as your vacation.
Just be very careful, Louie.
The seeds of adi-feebie have been planted in our minds.
: Adi-feebie, adi-feebie adi-feebie, adi-feebie, Adi-feebie, adi-feebie  I must talk to you.
I am thinking of going home to fight in the revolution.
Yeah, Latka, I knew you'd have to face this decision.
Yes, well, it is a very difficult one.
Latka, listen to me very carefully.
Now, look, you're an American now, and your life is right here.
Nevertheless, you have great feelings of loyalty and deep concerns for your people right there.
However, as a new citizen of this country, your responsibilities are right here.
The only thing that I can think of that you could do right now is to make the best decision that you can.
Thank you very much for trying to help me.
Anytime, Latka.
I might as well have been talking to my wrench.
Latka!
Why don't you just get to work?
I think you've played this revolutionary baloney for all it's worth.
Okay, I'll go get my tools.
Jeesh.
Louie, thank you for your great understanding of this terrible period in Latka's life.
Hello.
I'm showing my face at you with pleasure.
I am meeting you, and how is it?
Somebody shut the doors or this place is going to be crawling with flies.
Thank you very much.
I would like to put my face into Mr. Latka Gravas to please me, yes?
Oh, you're from Latka's country?
Ibeeda.
Baschi!
Latka!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Boom-boom.
I saw a couple of birds do that on Marlin Perkins once.
Have you met my friends?
No, thank you.
Okay.
Tony, Bobby, Alex, Elaine this is Baschi.
How do I do?
How do I do?
How do I do?
What's he saying?
He asks, "Have you read a good book lately"?
I can see the love of literature in his eyes.
Yo, Baschi.
How long you been in this country?
I came along with Latka.
Yes.
You see, I stayed in New York, and he went on to Hollywood.
I went to Hollywood to movie producer become.
Ooh, how exciting.
So what have you done?
Uh, Sid's Carwash.
Who was in that one?
Me, Sid and It was a real carwash.
Oh, you betcha.
But big plans I am making me.
Well, what are you doing in New York?
Oh, I am going home to fight in the revolution.
And, stopping here, I am to get Latka.
Baschi, ibeeda  Oh, no Baschi, I am American now.
Oh, no.
You must talk to me in American.
I am an American.
What, oh, sure, you are an American on the outside, with all your fine clothes.
But, on the inside  Baschi, I have here my apartment, my job, my friends.
I am giving up the movie business.
It's no use.
I have thought it over, and I have decided * Ibeeda ibee-dorfnish, ibeeda * * Ibeeda malka-morfnish, ibeeda * * Ibeeda  * Ibeeda ibee-dabee yaktabay yakta-babee * * Bilfkayo bilfka-yabe * Kerkaflik kerka-flumsmarch ibeeda * * I-bee-da.
I must go home.
Oh, why, Latka?
Well, because it is my country, and I love it.
And also because I am a general.
Ip chick.
Ip chick.
Ip chick.
Ip chick.
Ip chick.
Ip chick.
Abee dabee.
Icki bicki.
Abee dabee, icki bicki, abee dabee, icki bicki!
Well, you know, everyone is here except Louie.
I wish he would come.
I always liked Louie.
Yeah, I know, and I always wondered why.
He calls you names, he yells at you, and still, you're nice to him.
Yeah, but think how he would treat me if I weren't.
Good point.
All right, hey, come on.
I want to make the first toast.
Yeah, toast.
To the best mechanic around.
To one of the nicest guys that ever worked at the Sunshine Cab Company.
Hear!
Hear!
Well, I have to go rotate.
You have to circulate.
Oh, boy.
I am going to be very busy.
Oh, Alex, isn't there anything we can say to keep him here?
Elaine, he's made his decision.
No, we're not going to change his mind.
We'd only make him feel worse.
We're going to feel terrible if something happens to Latka, and we haven't done anything to stop him.
I mean, we're talking about war, for God's sake.
Hey, I'm the only one here was ever in a war, and I want to tell you, there's some positive things in it, too.
Oh, come on, Tony.
No, Elaine, I'm talking about friendships I'm talking about camaraderie.
You know, I never felt closer to another human being than I did to some of my buddies in Nam.
I remember one night, just before the Tet Offensive, I was sitting with two of my best buddies, Chuck and Matt.
Chuck said, "There's no way "the three of us are going to make it through this thing.
"Maybe one of us-- all right, maybe two of us-- but definitely not three".
I want to tell you, we cried that night.
I ain't ashamed-- we hugged that night.
What happened to Chuck and Matt?
I don't want to talk about it.
They didn't make it, huh?
No, they made it.
A year later, they married each other.
I heard they opened a roller-disco in L.A. Old soldiers never die.
Latka, can I talk to you a minute?
Oh, yes.
I know what you're going to say, Elaine.
"Latka, tonight is your last night here.
"Tomorrow you go to war, "so tonight I will give you my body to use as you will so that you will never forget me".
No, I wasn't going to say that.
But how about it?
Latka, sit down a minute.
Listen to me.
We know that you feel a tremendous obligation to this, but we're worried about you, and and we're not going to think that you're a coward if you decide not to go.
Elaine, there is one thing you don't understand.
My troops need me.
Latka, I think it's great that you became a general at such a young age.
Oh, it is easy to be a general in my country.
The hard part is to be a living general.
Hello?
Did I say something wrong?
Come on, everybody, cheer up.
Here, I brought something for all of you to drink.
Here, it's brefnish from the old country.
I've been saving it for a special occasion.
See?
Have some.
Well, cheers, everybody.
The line forms behind me.
In the old country, they do it like this.
Hey, all right, Tony!
Okay, Bobby.
Alex!
Oh, come on.
Come on!
Yay!
Now, this is the part where we all strip to the waist and set fire to the barns in the village.
All right!
We'll save that for your coming-home party.
Yes, thank you.
Hey, Latka?
Yeah?
What is it, Jim?
Your mind's really made up about this, huh?
Yes, it is, Jim.
And nothing I say is going to change it?
No, Jim.
Well, there's only one thing left for me to do.
What's that?
I'm going with you.
We'll fight this thing together.
I haven't had a chance to prove it, but I'm as good American as any man.
No, no, Jim, Jim, America is not involved in this one.
It is now.
Death to the revolutionary rebels!
But I am fighting for the revolutionary rebels.
Death to the imperialist stooges!
But they were thrown out a long time ago.
Death to the puppet regime!
But there is no puppet regime.
Who the hell are we fighting?
The tyrannical despot.
Well, the tyrannical despot will soon know the name Jim Ignatowski!
Right.
Already, it's spreading.
Louie!
Hi, Louie!
Oh, hello.
How are you?
It's so wonderful for you to come to my party.
I didn't come to the party.
I came to bring you your severance pay.
Oh.
I forgot to give it to you when you left.
Oh, thank you.
Don't thank me.
If it was up to me, you wouldn't get a dime.
It's bad enough you're leaving the company, but you're running out on America, too.
You think I'm going to go to a party for a guy like that?
Thanks, but no thanks.
Good-bye, Louie.
I'm not done with you, Latka.
Come here.
I'll give you another chewing-out.
Come on outside here.
Come out here.
Thank you, Louie.
Shh!
Take care of yourself.
Better give this guy a drink.
I was pretty rough on him.
Louie, wait.
Why don't you come and join the party?
No, no.
Hey, Louie you'd make us all feel miserable if you did.
Okay.
I knew he would come.
Well, I just don't want this evening to go without my making a toast.
To Latka who fixed our cabs and made us smile and brightened our lives.
Your honor calls you hence, and all the gods go with you.
Upon your sword sit laurel victory, and smooth success be strewed before your feet.
That's beautiful, Bobby.
That was from Anthony and Cleopatra.
Oh.
Well, thank them both for me.
As insane as war is, if the people in Latka's country are anything like Latka, they're worth fighting for.
Here's to Latka-- his homeland, his people and his safe return.
Now I would like to make a toast.
To all my friends in America.
I came here as a stranger, and you all helped me and taught me, and I want you all to know that I love you very much.
Ip chick.
Ip chick.
Abee dabee.
Icki bicki.
Abee dabee, icki bicki, abee dabee, icki bicki!
Ip chick.
Shh!
Is time to go, Baschi?
Yeah.
Good-bye, Alex.
Come back to us, Latka.
Okay.
Good-bye, Bobby.
Good-bye, Latka.
Come back safe.
Okay, I'll try.
Good-bye, Tony.
Take it easy, Latka.
Good-bye, Elaine.
Good-bye, Latka.
Good-bye.
I am going to miss you.
Good-bye, Louie.
Good-bye, Latka.
Okay, I'm ready.
Oh, Latka I'm going to write to you every day.
I promise.
Oh, thank you.
And I will write to you, too.
Okay.
Do you think, before you go, that maybe you could, like, draw a map of your country so that we know what you're talking about in your letters?
Do we have time, Baschi?
Yes, but quickly.
Hey, Tommy, you got that blackboard you used to use as menus?
Yeah.
It's in the back.
I'll get it.
Baschi?
Oh, excuse me, but I sure do know how to stink as an artist.
But here goes.
This is the borders sort of.
And this is the capital.
And here is the river Meshmend.
And this is the Faptosh mountain range.
And where will you be?
Ah, the rebel stronghold is at the top of Mount Faptosh.
This is where.
Where are the government troops?
Oy.
Uh excuse me, Baschi but where are the rest of the rebel forces?
Right here.
Uh wait.
Excuse me again, Baschi, but let me understand.
This is us?
That's right.
And this is them?
You betcha.
Well, now it's time for us to go.
No, no.
Now is time for you to kiss my yaktabe.
Latka, Latka, where are you going?
Where are you going?
I'm going home to watch the Tonight Show.

{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Who is it?
ALEX : Paint crew reporting for work, ma'am.
Come on in.
Hey!
You look great.
Hi, Elaine, how you doing?
Oh, really, thanks, guys.
Thanks for offering to help.
Hey, Elaine, what do you want to paint the apartment for?
It looks fine to me.
I just got this sudden urge.
Uh-oh, you're doing it again.
What?
Do you realize that every time you break up with a guy you paint your apartment?
No.
No?
Well, yeah, maybe I've done it a couple times.
Couple of times?
Elaine, there must be It's been a rough year.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Let's see, the blue one is Tom, and under Tom was Roger, and under Roger was Eric, and under Eric was I forget.
Looks like a dull gray.
My ex-husband.
Well, here's hoping it's your last coat.
Hey, guys, come on, what do you say?
I'm ready to work.
Okay, where do we start?
I, uh, I know a good way to do this.
Once in, uh, '65, some friends of mine and I painted my place by dipping our heads in buckets and then painting with our hair.
We were thinking of using brushes and rollers.
Hey, I'll try anything once.
Well, listen, while you guys figure this out, I have to run down and get my mail.
All right, come on.
Hey, Elaine, you know, you better hurry up or we're going to be done, you know?
Okay, okay.
Okay, first thing is, we put the tarp over the furniture.
Now we're cooking.
Here we go.
Come on, pick up an end.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, you know, this is silly, trying to do this and drink beer at the same time.
You're right.
Hey, guys, while we're working, maybe I'll turn on the Jet game.
We'll watch, you know what I mean, while we're working.
Hey, Tone, Tone, we're supposed to be painting.
That's all right, as long as we don't put the sound on, we'll watch it every once in a while.
Okay, come on, let's get this done, huh?
Sounds good.
Okay.
Hey, look at that.
Boy, you know, that Earl Campbell-- he's really something, huh?
Yeah.
I wonder how much he gets paid for a commercial like that.
Hey, we'll be painting anytime here, Elaine.
Hurry up.
Elaine, you better clear off those shelves-- we're going to hit that wall any second now.
Elaine?
Elaine?
What?
Something wrong?
: No, um It's just that somebody sent me a poem in the mail.
Oh?
A very romantic poem.
Oh, yeah?
Who?
I don't know, it's anonymous.
Uh what does it say?
You want me to read it out loud?
Oh, come on, Bobby, uh, it's probably very personal.
You don't read things like that out loud.
Geez, Bobby.
Pass it around-- we'll read it to ourselves.
No, no, no, that's okay, I'll read it, I'll read it.
"I saw you standing in a Manhattan sunset, "your auburn hair blowing from Atlantic winds.
"Your eyes were smiling at thoughts far away"  "dancing to sonnets only you could hear.
"If I could, I would build you a castle, "in a world in some other time, "a castle I could only imagine, a castle only you could inspire".
Can you believe that?
That's very pretty.
Who do I know that would do something like this?
Well, you can't rule out anybody.
It could be somebody from the garage, somebody from your gallery, somebody from your past.
: Maybe somebody in this very room, uh?
Oh, sure, one of you?
Hey, why not?
Hey, yeah, Elaine, you don't think we can be sensitive guys?
Yeah, maybe I'm being a little hard Hey, the Jets just scored.
Hi, Elaine.
Hi.
Alex, uh, I want to thank you guys for coming over to paint yesterday.
Hey, we enjoyed it.
When do you think you can come back and actually do the painting?
Anytime, Elaine, anytime.
You hear about the mash note Nardo got in her locker this morning?
Louie, it wasn't a mash note.
Yeah, I got another poem, I How did you know that that was in my locker?
I went through it.
You went through my locker this morning?
Don't get excited, I go through it every morning.
In fact, I go through everybody's lockers.
I'm responsible for everything that comes into this garage, so I have to ascertain if anything's being hidden illegal.
If you don't like it, buy a padlock.
I will.
I got two models-- the one-buck model and the ten-buck.
What's the difference?
The ten-buck takes me longer to pick.
Another poem, huh?
Yeah, this one's even sweeter than the first.
Poems get you hot, huh, Nardo?
Louie.
Hey, listen, if this was found in your locker, it must mean it's somebody in the garage.
I don't even care who it was.
No?
Why not?
No.
Because the whole thing is just so stupid and corny and high school.
And worst of all, it is getting me hot.
You know, Alex, um the thought has crossed my mind that, uh, maybe you were the one who wrote the poems.
Did you?
No, I'd like to claim them, but I'm not much of a poet.
I once wrote a poem for my wife.
She graded it.
Well, until I figure this out, it's gonna really drive me crazy.
Let me take a look at the handwriting.
Yeah, I don't understand Mm, French Elaine?
What?
No, never mind.
I have to do it.
Could I speak to you a second alone over there?
I guess.
Will you excuse us, Alex?
Yeah, sure.
What would you say if I told you the person you hate most on earth wrote those poems?
You wrote them?
You could have taken some time with that.
Do you expect me to believe this?
Is that so hard to believe?
All this time you've been writing me off as a lowlife.
Those poems are mine.
Maybe this will be a lesson to you, not to judge a book by its cover.
Louie?
Yes?
Would you recite one of your poems for me?
Are you testing me, Elaine?
You want to bring it down to that level?
Every poet I've ever heard can recite some of his own poetry.
Okay.
I can do that.
You want me to do it here?
Mm-hmm.
Cascading cascades cascading water a waterfall clouds lots of them, white and puffy.
You know, clouds And flowers covered with dew, and trees hanging over, and you and me naked on a rock.
That is the most disgusting poetry.
Just get away from me.
This close to the promised land.
Hey, guys.
Hi, Tony.
Hi.
Hey, great paint party.
Yeah.
Hey, you still reading that poem?
I got another one.
Another one?
Yep.
Yeah.
That's two poems in two days.
Yep.
Think they're from the same guy?
That's a thought.
Hey, guys.
Hey, how you doing?
Hi.
Hi, Jim.
Ignatowski!
Where you been?
I don't work weekends.
You been gone nine days.
Right.
Jim.
Weekends are only two days.
Oh, I thought we'd switched to the metric system.
Hey, guys, hey, guys, guess what?
Elaine got another one of them love notes today.
Yeah, and it was found in her locker, so I figure it must be somebody in the garage.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Hey, I bet I know who it is.
I'll betcha it's that Don Reavey guy who's always hitting on you.
You know, I thought of him, too.
Did you ever go out with this Don Reavey?
No.
He's a good-looking guy.
Yeah, if you consider dark, wavy hair, magnetic eyes and a killer smile attractive.
Some women go for that.
But I always thought of him as kind of shallow, you know?
I wish I could hang around and help you figure it out, but I'm late for an acting class-- I'll see you.
Hey, I'm gonna catch a ride with you to the gym.
Hey, thanks for the painting party, it was great.
Sure.
Nardo, telephone.
Elaine's enjoying those poems, huh?
Yeah.
She'd enjoy them a lot more if she knew who was writing them.
Maybe the guy's got a good reason for keeping quiet.
Like what?
Maybe he writes better than he looks, talks is.
Yeah, maybe.
Jim, is this you?
Sure.
Is this you, Alex?
You're the one that's been writing these poems.
No, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are.
Okay, okay, I can't take this browbeating.
Why are you doing this?
Shh.
: Why are you doing this?
What?
Come here.
What's this all about?
Those poems sound like you're in love with Elaine.
I'm in love with Elaine in the sense that I'm in love with all living things.
You don't write poems to all living things.
Yes, I do.
You don't mail poems to all living things.
Yes, I do.
What?
Look, let me explain.
You remember when Elaine broke up with that guy named Steve?
Yeah.
We were all sitting around Mario's having a beer, and Elaine came in, and she was real down.
Yeah.
So I said to myself, I know what will pick that lady up-- a nice poem.
So I thought I'd go down to the library and look one up, but I couldn't find one.
Couldn't find a poem?
I couldn't find a library.
So I had to make up my own poem.
And I sent it to her, and it worked.
Took her head off her troubles.
Why don't you tell her?
She's dying to know.
She only wants to know who wrote the poems because she doesn't know who wrote the poems.
You mean that if she found out it was you, she'd be disappointed?
There are a lot of people in this world who think I'm a flake.
Who thinks that?
Me, for one.
So what do you say we keep this between the two of us?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
It might not be so much harm if Elaine believes that she has a secret admirer.
Let's shake on it.
We just shook on it.
Oh, good.
Great, I don't have to go to the gallery today.
Hi, Elaine.
Hi, Don.
Um Don, could I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.
Thanks, Louie.
I don't know whether you've heard or not, but somebody has been sending me anonymous poetry.
Yeah.
You heard about that?
Yeah.
Do you know anything about it?
Yeah.
You know who's been sending me the poetry?
Yeah.
You?
Yeah.
You know, I kind of thought so.
In fact, you were one of the first people I thought of.
Yeah?
You read a lot of poetry?
Yeah.
It's kind of surprising, you know, because, uh, the image that you have around the garage is so different from poetry.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
You have a way with words.
Yeah.
You want to go out for some coffee?
Yeah.
Did you see what just happened?
Can you believe she fell for that?
Hey, I fell for it, and I wrote them.
I don't know about you guys, but I can't possibly go paint Elaine's apartment again.
We've been over there four times in the last two weeks, and every time I come back with the worst hangover.
We put away a lot of beer.
Well, maybe if we did some painting next time Hey, uh, if you guys feel so bad, how come I feel fine?
Y-You mean your head doesn't hurt and your tongue doesn't feel thick and grungy, and-and your body doesn't feel like it's been turned inside out?
Yeah.
Jim, some people find that feeling very uncomfortable.
Hey, Elaine, you look foxed out.
Thanks.
You going out with Don Reavey again?
Yeah.
I guess we have been seeing a lot of each other.
You mean, you been dating this guy because of his poems?
Oh, not entirely.
He's a very sweet person.
You know, I really hope that you all get to know him better.
I hope I get to like him better.
No, Tony, he's really nothing like you see in the garage.
I mean, inside, there's this very sweet, sensitive human being.
I mean, you read his poems.
Yeah, well, somehow, I just can't put Don Reavey and those poems together-- they seem like two different guys to me, if you know what I mean.
I-I used to be like that.
Had a split personality.
When I was with people, I was the life of the party, but I'd get home alone, all by myself, I'd clam up.
Yeah.
Uh Okay, I have some cabs to get out here.
Wheeler, Stargill, Banta, let's get the cars on the road here.
Um, Louie, I just stopped by to tell you that I'm not going to be driving this weekend.
I know.
You're going to Vermont for the weekend with Don Reavey.
How did you know that?
I found train tickets and ski rental slips in his locker.
Did you hear that?
They're going away for the whole weekend.
That's pretty serious-- the two of them alone together for nine days.
Jim, listen to me, you've got to tell her.
I can't do it, Alex.
Um, Elaine, uh, I want to tell you something.
Uh, Don Reavey is not your poet-- he's a liar.
Alex, I know you don't like Don, but No, it has nothing to do with not liking him.
He did not write the poems.
How do you know that?
Because I know who wrote them.
You're serious, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
Well?
Huh?
Uh, no, I I'm sorry.
Come on, who wrote the poetry?
I promised I couldn't tell.
Oh, great!
But I didn't promise I wouldn't nod if you guessed it right.
Alex, I'm not gonna play stu-- Tony.
Bobby.
Brian.
Val.
Nick.
Johnny Fingers.
Eddie.
Billy.
Ron.
Harry?
Um, Pepe, Carlo, Pedro, uh, Pavlovsky, Carlos, uh, uh, Jeff, Ahmad Latka.
No.
The bald guy who comes on Thursdays?
Sheila?
Sheila?
Well, that's everybody in the garage.
So I guess it's nobody.
Yeah it's nobody.
It's you.
How did you guess?
I can't believe it.
I'm sorry.
Why did you do it?
I thought you'd like it.
Oh, I liked it.
Oh, yeah, and like I liked it so much that that I started falling in love with the guy.
I was just trying to make you feel better.
Well, good job.
I can honestly say without fear of contradiction that this this is the most embarrassed I've ever been in my whole life.
You know, on second thought I guess I should be happy about one thing.
You finally got it through my thick skull that, uh, there aren't going to be any castles in my life.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, Alex what do I do to make her feel better?
I'm afraid there aren't any easy answers, Jim.
I know a pill that would do it.
But it has a terrible side effect.
Like what?
It wears off.
See?
There are castles.
This is incredible.
Thanks, I made it myself.
This is the most amazing thing anyone has ever done for me.
Thank you.
I was, uh, going to buy you a scarf, but I couldn't find a department store.
Still upset?
You're making it hard.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'd better go.
I've got to get up sometime tomorrow.
Oh, Jim, wait.
There's something not right here.
Hey, uh, I didn't have time for a moat.
I'll see you.
Could you tell me where I catch the bus from here?
Why didn't you just drive your van over?
Well, uh your castle has about Oh, God.
Hey, how about, uh, I crash here for a year or so?
Jim.
I know.
I'm not every woman's dreamboat.
But you are the dearest, sweetest, most wonderful person.
I think you're right.
Funny thing, there used to be a time when that was enough.
Excuse me.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Well, looks like I'm going to fight Rocky Sinicori again.
Oh, yeah, I remember him.
Yeah, he gave me a good fight.
I guess he deserves another shot.
What, are you crazy?
He knocked you out in the second round.
Yeah, but now he's going around shooting off his mouth, saying he can do it in one.
He says he had walking pneumonia or something that night, you know?
Fever of 104.
Oh, I hate a man who makes excuses.
Me, too.
I say I can go two rounds with Rocky Sinicori, pneumonia or no pneumonia.
Hey.
Got my first fan letter today.
Yeah?
Oh It's a real weird one.
You'll like this, Elaine.
"Dear Mr. Wheeler, I saw you in a TV commercial, "and I think you're real cute.
"Would you please "send me a photograph, a lock of your hair, "one of your shirts, a pair of your shoes and a pillow you've slept on"?
"Thank you, love, Shirley".
I can't believe that someone would have the nerve to ask for this stuff.
I mean, the postage to send it would cost you It came to $4.98.
Hi, everybody.
Zena!
Five minutes to candy time!
Hey, Zena, how ya doing?
Hey, Zena, I don't think you've met Jim.
Jim Ignatowski, this is Zena Sherman.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Yeah, Reverend Jim's one of our new drivers.
Uh-huh.
Zena's Louie's girlfriend.
Oh, I thought you looked familiar.
I saw your picture in Louie's office.
Oh, yeah, you mean the one where my face is taped to the body of Miss October?
Hello, there, honey lips.
Hi, boss.
I think he means Zena.
Oh, my mistake.
How ya doing, Zena?
Get lost!
Look at Reiger and Ignatowski.
They think you're serious.
She loves me.
I am serious.
Get away and leave me alone.
On the floor!
What a sense of humor!
Stop it, Louie.
You're making a jackass of yourself.
A jackass!
Did you hear that?
I tell her, "Zena, get out of the vending company".
She should be in clubs.
She won't listen to me.
Yeah, well, Zena's very talented.
Come on, Jim, what say you and I leave these two zany people together, okay?
Okeydoke.
Boy, that Zena's quite a card, ain't she?
I know you're still peeved at me, but you don't have to let everybody in the garage know it, too.
I don't care.
You brought all this on yourself.
All I asked you for was one simple favor, and I don't ask for many favors, Louie.
We've been all over this.
I told you why I refused.
Something like this could blow everything we've got going.
All right.
Okay, fine.
Have it your way.
But until you change your mind, we don't have anything going.
Understand?
Not anything.
Are you trying Anything!
You mean, no more slave girl and the emperor.
You got it.
Hey, listen, I want to give you a little warning, baby I'm a tough habit to break.
You're a Louie addict.
Nobody's been able to do it cold turkey.
Good-bye, Lou.
Here it is, Mr Shut up!
All is not well in Louie-land.
Gee, I wonder what's wrong between him and Zena.
It must be hard on a guy like Louie, not having any friends to talk to when you're in trouble, you know?
Yeah, well, who cares?
Let's play.
I'll talk to him.
No.
No, no, Jim.
You don't want to do that.
I understand what the man's going through.
All he needs to do is relax, rest his mind, get in touch with the oneness of the universe.
What are you doing in here, Ignatowski?
Okay, boss.
Close your eyes take a deep breath relax all your muscles and listen to the sound of being.
: Ooommm.
Ooommm.
Ooommm.
It worked.
It worked.
Somebody get Sleeping Beauty out of here before I attach his tongue to a battery charger.
"Oommm".
Get him out of here.
He's omed out.
Reiger.
What?
Can I speak to you alone?
Where can we be alone in here?
Don't worry about it.
All right, everybody out of the garage except for Reiger.
Everybody out!
Why?
Because it's a fire drill.
If you don't get out, you're all fired.
Come on!
And take swami with you.
Can I see you a second?
Come on, Louie, I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to talk to you.
Come on, Reiger, give me a couple of minutes.
You can spare another human being two minutes of your time.
Yes, but how does that relate to this conversation?
Go ahead, terrific, do jokes while I'm standing here in pain.
All right, all right, all right, you've got two minutes.
But I'm gonna preface this conversation by telling you that I think very much of Zena.
I think she's terrific, and I think she's much too good for you.
You got two minutes starting right now.
Zena wants me to meet her folks.
Why?
She's punishing them for a lousy childhood?
No, no, she's real close to her parents, and they want to meet me, and to tell you the truth, I don't mind meeting them.
I mean, it's not inconceivable that, you know, someday, Zena and I might Marriage, Louie?
Yeah, yeah.
Just the other day, I was thinking about kids and about a home and settling down, and suddenly, for the first time in my life, all those things didn't make me nauseous.
Oh, that's beautiful.
You've got one minute left.
If they were normal people, I wouldn't worry about making a good impression.
You know how charming I can be when I want to.
Yeah, it's scary.
But they're decent people.
I mean, I'm not used to being around decent people.
I know, Lou.
Her father, in fact, her father has one of the worst imaginable professions for me to get along with.
He's an exterminator?
He's a minister.
You're kidding.
If you're asking me to talk Zena out of this, just forget it.
I'm not gonna do it.
No, no, that's not what I'm asking.
I want you to go with me.
What?
Yeah, I figure that if you were there, you could kinda, you know, help me out by stopping me before I said something I shouldn't.
Plus, it would give Zena's parents a chance to see the kind of people I have for friends.
We are not friends.
Well, you know what I mean.
I mean the kind of people that I associate with.
We do not associate.
Well, we do something together.
What do you call what we are to each other?
We have a longtime awareness that the other exists, and we know each other's names.
So what do you say?
You've got ten seconds.
Come on, Reiger, please.
Nine, eight Come on, do it for me, for us.
For our friendship Seven, six For our longtime awareness.
Five, four For all the favors that I've done for you.
For $200.
Three, two By golly, my watch stopped.
Coming.
Hi, Mom.
I'm so glad to see you.
And you must be Louie.
I don't shake hands with anyone who's so close to my daughter.
Oh, no, Mom, Mom.
This is Louie.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
The man you just hugged is Alex Reiger.
Oh!
Well, I'm very happy to meet both of you.
Let me have your coats.
Oh, thank you.
Then go in, sit down.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Thank you very much.
There we go.
Boy, Mom, the house looks beautiful.
Oh, yes, very nice Tasteful.
It smells okay, too.
Thank you.
You know, Mrs. Sherman, you are a very attractive woman.
I hope that Zena is as attractive as you in 60 years.
Strike one.
I screwed up.
I won't screw up again.
Thank you.
Cheese and crackers, anyone?
Oh, thanks, Mom.
Oh, yeah.
I'm really so happy you could all come today.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sherman, that you had to make room at the last moment for an extra person.
Oh, that's quite all right.
The reason that I brought Alex along was so that I could show you the kind of classy guy that I pal around with.
Say something classy, Alex.
Well Louie, you're putting me on the spot.
I mean, this is an impossible situation.
Besides, it's better to remain silent and be thought the fool than to speak and remove all doubt.
You better come up with something quick, Reiger.
I'm paying good money.
Well, I have to check on the roast, so just make yourselves at home.
Oh, you need some help, Mom?
Oh, no, I can handle it, darling.
Mr. Sherman will be home any minute.
Excuse me.
Well, can I get that for you?
Thank you.
Certainly, ma'am.
I don't know why I was so worried.
She's eating out of the palm of my hand.
It's embarrassing.
Well, maybe not the palm of your hand Oh, but you're doing fine, Louie.
You know, I don't even think that was an excuse.
I think she really had to check on the roast.
Yeah.
I told you they'd like you.
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, we don't even need Reiger anymore.
No, no, no, please, Louie, let me stay.
I can pick up some pointers on charm tonight.
That must be Daddy.
Bring him on.
Oh good evening.
Hi, Daddy.
MRS.
Nathan, is that you?
Well, if it's not, your daughter is hugging a stranger.
That was some joke!
Yes I'm bunching up phlegm, here, it was so good.
Are you Louie?
No, I'm sorry.
Dad, I want you to meet Louie De Palma and his friend Alex Reiger.
Oh, how do you do?
Nice to meet you.
Very nice to meet you.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
Oh, that's okay.
You can stand me up for God anytime.
Oh, all right, I must remember that.
He must remember that.
That's good-- that's real good.
Well, shall we take a load off?
Uh, I'll just go tell Mom to serve anytime she's ready.
Well I'm glad that we're finally getting this chance to meet you, Louie.
Likewise.
Would you gentlemen like some wine?
A little vino.
Yes, that would be very nice.
Zena has already told us a lot about you, Louie.
I, uh understand you live with your mother.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Well, you know, she's, she's kind of old, and she needs somebody to take care of her.
Oh, is she able to get around by herself?
Oh, yeah, she's okay physically.
It's just that her antenna doesn't pick up every channel, if you know what I mean.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Oh, but she's fine.
She's really a corker.
I mean, some of the things that she does will really crack you up.
Like the other night, she's laying in the bathtub That's a mighty big bass you've got there, Mr. Sherman.
That's really big.
What is that, a 15-, Oh, no, no, no, that's 18½ pounds.
Wow, 18½.
I caught that last fall at Sundown Lake.
Oh?
I've never been prouder of anything in my life.
I see.
Do you fish, Mr. Reiger?
Well, no I mean, uh I don't get much of a chance to.
Actually, when I was a kid, I used to go fishing with my uncle.
Used to take me to Tucker Creek.
Oh, I've been to Tucker Creek many times.
Yeah?
It's wonderful.
The brook trout in that area are fabulous.
Which reminds me of a joke I once heard.
How do you keep a fish from smelling?
I don't know.
You cut off his nose.
Well, uh now that we've exhausted that topic does anybody want any more wine?
No, thanks.
Don't mind if I do.
Did I tell you that my family is in the wine business?
In fact, my cousin Guido probably had his feet in this a couple of weeks ago.
That was a delicious dinner, Mrs. Sherman.
Thank you.
Delicious.
That was wonderful!
I loved it.
I loved it!
Well, thank you.
I'm very glad that you enjoyed it.
Beth, you've hardly touched your food.
Well, I have a little touch of indigestion.
Oh, so do I. I hope we don't have to have a race to the can after dinner.
That bass was what-- The fish again?
So Zena, Louie, why don't you tell us all about those little things that parents want to know about their daughter's boyfriend?
About your dating, the wheres, the hows the-the-the whys.
I'd been admiring Louie from afar and Alex introduced us.
Louie asked me out right away.
And well, it was rocky at first, till we got to know each other.
Yeah.
Whoa, it was really tough for me.
You see, I had never been out with a girl like Zena before.
I don't mind talking about this, I mean, because now it's all behind me.
I mean But Zena is the first non-pro I've ever been out with.
Non-pro?
Yeah, let me, let me explain this.
Uh, um, you see uh, as far as me having a lasting relationship before I met Zena, the longest relationship I ever had was 30 minutes.
Louie, Louie Louie, Louie.
You know what I'm talking about, huh, padre?
Oh, for God's sake, Louie.
What, Reiger?
Loosen up.
Everybody's having a good time here.
Have some more of the grape.
Oh, but seriously now, this tomato is the best thing that ever happened to Louie De Palma.
Well, excuse me.
I think I'd better clear the dishes.
Why don't you all go in the living room, and I'll bring in some coffee.
Oh, yes, coffee.
Coffee!
Coffee is a good idea.
Louie.
Louie, how about if you volunteer to stay and help me?
Do I have a choice?
Where should we start, mon general?
Oh, Louie-- Louie, I have a confession to make.
I didn't really want you to help me clear the table.
I did this because I want to talk to you.
I'm sorry, Beth, I already have a girl.
Sit down, Louie.
This will only take a moment.
It's about you and Zena.
Oh.
You know, Louie, uh, Mr. Sherman and I have always tried very hard not to interfere in Zena's life.
We've been aware that being the child of a minister is sometimes difficult.
There are people who sometimes are uneasy around you or they tease you, or they think you're overly righteous.
And knowing that, we've always tried to let Zena have as much freedom as any other kid possibly more.
That's why I'm going to give my blessing to this relationship.
So go ahead, Louie, and continue seeing Zena and have dates and be friends, or whatever you like, but Louie, I don't think it would be a good idea for the two of you to ever start planning anything or talking about something like marriage.
Because if you do, I'll have you killed.
I think I can do that, can't I?
I mean, I read about that in a book once.
You can hire people to do that for you, can't you?
Yeah.
Now, what do you call them?
Hit men.
Hit men-- that's it.
I've got to remember that.
I know that they charge quite a bit of money.
Yeah.
But you know, it would probably ruin everything I've ever tried to do with my life.
And poor Nathan!
He would be destroyed, but it would be worth it, don't you think?
I don't know.
Well, now, you can go and join the others, and I'll get the coffee.
Oh, by the way, please, don't say anything about this to Zena or to Mr. Sherman.
We'll just keep this as our own little secret, all right?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Hit men?
Yeah, hit men.
Hit men.
So of course, by the time I landed the darn thing, I was up to my knees in mud.
Another fish story, Reiger?
Well, don't let me interrupt you.
Lou, did you have a nice talk with Mom?
Oh, yes, delightful.
And now we can all have our coffee.
Good.
Here you are, Nathan.
Zena.
Thanks, Mom.
Alex.
Thank you.
And this is for you, Louie.
Switch with me.
Huh?
Switch with me.
Why?
Just do it.
All right.
Ma, did you enjoy your talk with Lou?
Oh, very much.
I'll never forget it.
Will you, Louie?
No I'll never forget it either, ma'am.
Good.
I assure you, I meant everything I said from the bottom of my heart.
Well, I think we'd better be going.
Oh.
Well, it's late.
I've got to get up for work tomorrow.
Oh, but, Louie, we haven't had our coffee yet.
I don't want any coffee, thank you.
Why, I'm sorry that you have to leave so soon.
Well Next time you can all come to my place.
Well, we'll be looking forward to that.
I'm sure.
Yeah, well, uh Good night, good night everybody.
Good night, Alex.
Good night, Mr. Sherman.
Good night, Louie.
Say good night to Mom, Lou.
Uh, good night, Mrs. Sherman.
Good night, Louie.
You know something, Mom?
You know what would really make me happy?
Hmm?
If you'd give Lou a little good-bye kiss.
Oh, no, no, no.
Why, I'd be happy to.
No, no, we No.
No.
See?
And you were worried.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Who did you bet on in the fourth race?
That stiff Hey, where have you guys been?
Aw, you don't want to know, Elaine.
This is kind of a sore point with you, and I think the less said about it in front of you, the better.
Last time we went to the track, you went nuts.
I told her.
Maybe she missed it.
You mean that you guys cannot think of a better way to throw away your money?
Nope.
She got it.
Not everybody lost.
Latka won a few races.
He's got a system.
Oh, yeah?
Latka, what's your system?
Oh, uh, uh, my system is based on the temperature.
You mean the temperature of the air has something to do with how you bet?
Oh, no, no-- the temperature of the horse.
And you actually won money?
Yes.
I won $12.
Uh-huh.
How much did you lose?
$36.
I did that well without a system.
Yeah, but can you do it every time?
Guys, this gambling thing has got to stop.
Don't lecture, Nardo.
I suppose you don't have any vices of your own.
Sure, I have vices.
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
Okay, forget it, forget it.
I'm not going to let this thing upset me, all right?
Hey, I want to thank you guys for taking me along.
You mean you took Jim with you?
!
This man is just getting his head beneath water, and you have to go and turn him on to something gambling?
Nardo, would you?
Forget it.
Okay, okay, okay.
I wish I'd started gambling a long time ago.
I've been looking for something to take the place in my life of, uh, uh, what do you call it?
Uh drugs?
No, thanks.
Well, what I mean is, I never I never got into the real kick of betting.
It makes life so much more interesting.
Right now, that guy's over there getting something to drink.
Ordinarily, that wouldn't mean a thing to me but, if I were to bet on what drink he'd choose, the next few seconds would be thrilling.
I got a buck that says it's coffee.
Hey, hey, hey, Bob.
Vodka gimlet.
Jim!
Jim, there's only coffee and hot chocolate in that machine.
Well, so, give me odds.
No, no, no.
Give him odds.
A hundred to one.
I can't pass that by.
Oh, for crying out loud.
Hey, uh, how's the gimlet?
It's coffee.
I told you so, man.
Thanks, Bobby.
You're welcome.
For giving me that thrill.
My last thrill for a while.
Hey, Jim, I didn't mean to take your last dollar.
Then give it back.
Okay.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Pooky Juanina Alex, I really hope that you're satisfied, because you just turned Jim into a gambling junkie.
Hey, come on, Elaine.
It's his money, you know?
It's his business.
It's his life.
And it's your fault.
Look, Elaine, just because your ex-husband was a gambler Oh do not bring my ex-husband into this.
He has nothing to do with this whatsoever.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Do you know that my ex-husband was a gambler?
It was rumored to that effect, yes.
Why?
Alex, I know about gambling.
I mean, I'm worried about Jim.
Excuse me.
Uh, are you fighting over me?
Well, perhaps we are, yeah.
Well, don't worry, Elaine, because I don't have any more money to gamble with anyhow.
Oh, Ignatowski, can I see you a second?
How's it going, Pally?
Oh, average.
Sit down?
Sure.
Uh, Iggy, you want to spin over here?
Oh.
Uh By any chance, would you be interested in borrowing a few bucks to, say, gamble on the horses?
Would you lend that to me?
Sure.
You're a good risk.
I know you'd work real hard to pay me back the loan plus the interest, which is the usual, uh, 85%.
Sounds like a good deal.
Is a handshake good enough for you?
Sure.
Well, it ain't for me.
Just, uh, sign it right there on the dotted line.
Okeydoke.
Excuse me, boss.
What does this say in the little tiny letters?
Oh, uh, that's just a, you know, a formality.
That says, in the event that you're unable to pay me back, I have the right to sell your body for medical experiments.
Oh, oh.
You mean after I'm dead.
No.
Right there.
Hi, everybody.
Hey, Alex.
Oh, hi, Alex.
Hey, have you seen Jim?
No, I haven't.
Why?
'Cause none of us have seen him lately, either.
He's been at the track every day this week.
Am I really going to get another anti-gambling sermon from a woman holding a handful of little pasteboards with little pictures of kings and queens on them?
She's got kings and queens?
I fold.
This is a game, Alex.
There's no money involved.
Oh, yeah.
I'm back in.
Hi, everybody.
Hi, Jim.
Hi, Jim.
How you doing?
Jim, come here.
I want to talk to you.
Okeydoke.
Over here, Jim.
Look, Jim, I know you've been at the track very often now-- almost every day-- and maybe you're enjoying yourself but, Jim, look, there's another side to gambling, and I want to tell you about it.
Look, Jim, first, you borrow from Louie.
Then, when he runs out of money, you'll have to go to a loan shark.
Fine.
Fine?
No, no, no.
Jim, the next thing you know, you're going to get a visit from some guy with no neck carrying a baseball bat, and he wants his money back, Jim!
I'll, uh give him the money.
But you won't have the money, Jim!
I'll ask him to wait a while.
Yeah.
He'll say, : Ignatowski, I waited long enough.
Well, um, I need a little time.
Ignatowski, you got two choices: You either pay me the money now, or you pay me the money now.
Yeah, he pulls that, and I'll call the cops.
Jim, what are the police going to do for you?
They'll protect me.
I'll tell them there's a man trying to kill me.
: Oh, yeah?
Ignatowski?
You say your name is Ignatowski?
Oh, that name rings a bell.
Are you the same Ignatowski who was smoking an illegal substance on the 24th of May, 1968, and then you ran six red lights Five!
Five lights!
Huh?
Huh?
I got to get out of town.
I'll hide in my folks' house.
: Jim, Jim, it's so good to have you back home.
My son.
There were some strange men came here today, say you owe them some money.
They took away your mama.
Mom!
So, now, what are you going to do, Jim?
I'll go see a priest!
I don't do priests.
You got to.
It's my only hope.
Look, Jim, you've got to control yourself.
You got to get some kind of control about this gambling.
You're right.
I quit.
I quit forever.
Good, Jim.
You're going to quit, and you're going to pay back all of your losses.
What losses?
All the money that you lost gambling.
I haven't lost money gambling.
I won $10,000.
You won $10,000?
You see that?
He won.
Jim, just don't forget who got you started.
I bet $35 on a named "On Dasher".
You bet on a Yeah, well, I identify with the long shots.
Here you are, Louie-- every penny of your money, plus interest, plus a couple of bucks for your troubles.
You see that?
All your complaining, all your lecturing-- the guy walks in here richer than all of us.
He can now change his life if he wants to.
So what are you going to do with the rest of the money, Jim?
Nothing.
I've already spent it.
What?
!
What?
!
What were you saying?
He spent all his?
You spent all your money?
You spent the rest of all that money?
!
How many bars are between the track and here?
Uh, 84 but I didn't go into any of them.
How could you win $10,000 on a horse race, and then blow it all immediately?
What did you spend the money on, Jim?
Ignatowski!
Yo?
Thanks.
They, uh, threw in the saddle.
He bought a racehorse.
I know he bought a racehorse.
I can see a racehorse.
He bought a racehorse!
He used to be a racehorse.
But, after the race, I took one look at him-- all sweaty and foamy and favoring one leg and limping on the other three.
It broke my heart.
It seemed to me he won that money for me, so I felt I should return the favor.
So I went up to the owner and I asked him how much would it cost me to buy that horse.
And he said, "How much you got"?
And, would you believe it?
It was the same.
Huh?
Bobby.
Yeah?
You want to give me a hand with the saddle here?
Yeah, sure.
Ask him what he's going to do with a racehorse.
What are you going to do with a racehorse, Jim?
!
I'm, uh, giving him his freedom.
He's giving him his What?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, come on, everybody, let's get that horse!
How are we going to catch a horse?
He's a 300-to-one shot.
We can outrun him.
Oh, boy.
Let him go, everybody.
I want him to be free.
Jim, you can't just let a horse run free on the streets of New York.
Jim, this is not the frontier.
There's no place for On Dasher to go on the streets of New York.
Alex, don't call him On Dasher.
That was his slave name.
Oh.
Well, what's his new name?
Uh uh Gary.
Gary.
That's a nice name.
Gary.
Get that ugly, smelly, dirty creature out of my garage, and tell him to take his horse with him.
Now, Louie, would you just calm down?
We got a problem here.
We're trying to figure out what to do with Jim's horse.
Does the word glue ring a bell with anybody?
Hey, Louie, that ain't nice, Louie.
You want me to make it nice?
We'll use the glue to paste Easter seals.
Hey.
Hi.
Hey, how you doing?
Glad you guys could come over.
Hi, Jim.
Hi.
I, uh like your place, uh, Jim.
It's it's you, Jim.
When I first got it, it was a fixer-upper.
Nice kitchen.
Thanks.
You get all your electricity off that?
Yeah, I have to.
It's a condemned building.
No kidding.
Yeah.
The other end's plugged in to the apartment across the way.
I hang my laundry on the cord so they don't notice.
Hey, Jim, you know, now that you got some steady money coming in, don't you think you could afford to move?
Nah.
I kind of like living here.
The great thing about living in a condemned building is that nothing can happen to it.
I mean, what are they going to do-- come along and save it?
Hey, Jim, uh where's Gary?
Shh!
He's asleep in the bedroom.
Ah!
Well, how's he been doing the past couple of weeks?
Oh, fine.
I got him some hay and a horse blanket and lots of good food, and I got a heater to keep the room warm.
Every horse in the world should be treated that good.
Yeah.
I take him out for walks in the park every day.
Oh, yeah?
I imagine you must get some funny looks, huh?
Yeah but those poodle people have stopped acting like they own the place.
Say, uh, why don't you guys make yourself comfortable and tell me what you found out.
Well, mainly that there's less of a demand for used horses in midtown Manhattan than you might think, Jim.
I checked the Police Academy, but they only use young, healthy horses.
We still didn't get an answer on that ad in the paper.
There's dude ranches, if you want to take him someplace-- like Arizona.
Oh it might do him good.
He's got a bad cough.
He's had it ever since I got him.
Can't seem to kick it.
Jim, you know, if he has a cough, maybe you should have a vet look at him.
I did.
He said I might have to, uh, bring him in next week for some tests.
Said he'd like to take a look at me while he's at it.
Walnuts?
Right on, Jim, right on.
So that means we're no better off than when we started.
Nobody wants this horse.
That's right.
Well, you know, I'm kind of glad no one wants him.
I've been alone a long time, and I'm kind of getting used to having him around.
It's great having someone to have dinner with, you know, watch TV with, uh, talk to.
Hey, Jim, you got a nutcracker?
Right in front of you.
You mean the table?
By golly, I guess that could be used as a table.
Uh, you're not doing it right.
Well, thanks a lot, Jim.
Want another?
I think I'll just save mine for later.
You guys.
Hey, Jim?
You think he's going to wake up soon, so we could say hello?
He's got to be.
He's been asleep quite a while.
Oh?
Incidentally, you know, it's not true what they say about horses sleeping standing up.
Really?
How does he sleep?
Uh like this.
Uh, Jim, I, uh Jim, uh, tell me, uh, how long has he been sleeping like that?
Uh, since the day before yesterday.
The day before yesterday.
I guess winning that race took a lot out of him.
Quite a bit.
Jim, uh, you mind if I go and take a look at him?
Sure, go ahead.
Hey, Bobby, don't wake him up.
Which one?
Which is the guest room?
I'm not sure.
Jim, uh I-I'm afraid that that Gary isn't going to go for any more walks with you, Jim.
Oh, no.
Gary?
Hey, Bobby, what are you talking about?
The horse hung himself?
Tony, he died.
He's taking it harder than I thought he would.
Yeah.
I wish we could do something to pick him up a little bit, you know?
Hey, Jim?
How you doing, Jim?
That apartment seems real empty without that horse.
You know, I'm really surprised at you, Jim.
Here, Gary's been gone a couple of days, and we haven't had a service for him.
A service?
Yeah.
You know, you may not have noticed, but a lot of guys in the garage are really feeling down about him.
Well, I'm not surprised.
That horse didn't have an enemy in the world.
Well, you're a man of the cloth, Jim.
You mean, like a memorial service?
Yeah.
You know, like a simple eulogy.
I mean, you must have done it before, huh?
Uh I must have.
Okay, uh everybody?
You want to gather around?
Yeah, uh we're going to have a little service here for Gary.
Uh the horse, uh died.
Bring a pew.
Nice, Bob.
Uh Please be seated.
I'll make this as brief and simple as possible, because I think that's the way he would have wanted it.
Now, uh, I don't know what faith Gary was raised in, but I know he was bred and raised to run.
When he was young, he was fast, and I bet it felt good.
He put everything he had into going as fast as he was able.
But, as he got older, something began to happen.
He was running just as hard, but all the other horses were passing him by.
I don't know how much animals understand, but Gary must have wondered what the hell was happening to him.
Right up to the last, you could see he thought that maybe, if he could get out there on a fast track on a warm day, it would all come back to him, because, in his heart, he was still a two-year-old.
I think, uh, when your legs give out, it's nice to have people around who understand what's in your heart.
Well, I can't think of anything else.
Is that enough, Alex?
Yes, that's quite enough, Jim.
Thank you.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, I know.
Take it easy.
Hey, Ignatowski?
Ignatowski?
I'm, I I really liked what you said here.
Thanks, boss.
When the time comes, you think you could do that for my ma?
I mean, you wouldn't even need to change the words much.
Anytime.
Thanks, Iggy.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
I'm looking for Tony Banta the boxer.
Would you settle for Tony Banta the bum?
He's over there.
Thanks.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
You coming into my garage, you gonna leave me a dollar deposit.
Take it.
It's non-refundable.
That's okay, as long as I get it back.
Hey, Vince!
Hey, Vince, what are you doing here?
Hey, guys, this is Vince from my gym.
Hey, Vince, these are my friends, uh, Elaine, Alex and Bobby.
Hi.
Hi, there.
Hey.
Nice to see you.
I got something personal I want to talk to you about.
Hey, Vince, I'll get my dirty laundry out of the locker this weekend.
That's not what I want to talk to you about, but, of course, it would be nice.
No problem.
Hey, come on, we're going to go to breakfast, Tony.
You want to come?
No, I'll catch up later.
Okay.
Okay, yeah.
See you later.
Hey, so what's up?
I just found out that Benny Foster wants to make a comeback.
Are you kidding me?
Benny Foster's an old man.
What does he want to come back for and get beat?
Hey, he used to be champ.
Maybe he's still good.
Anyway, he's not going to challenge any top contenders right away.
He'll fight some unknowns first.
I don't believe this-- Benny Foster fighting unknowns.
It's a shame, Vince, a lousy shame.
How low will this guy sink?
He wants to fight you.
That low?
Let me get you some coffee, man, huh?
Tony, you don't understand.
You get a chance to fight Benny Foster.
You sure you got this straight?
Why me?
Look, his manager comes over to my gym.
He says they're looking for a young fighter who hits hard, moves well, wins occasionally and you were the sixth one that came to my mind.
Wow, me and Benny Foster.
I guess this could be like a big opportunity for me, huh?
Sure, look at all the publicity-- newspapers, radio, television.
They're going to televise the fight?
They are?
Where where did you hear that?
I thought you just said that.
No, I just meant the news.
Oh, wow.
Man, me getting a chance at one of the greatest fighters ever.
Boy, it's kind of like a painter getting a chance to beat up on Rembrandt.
Yeah.
You're one lucky guy, Tony.
Yeah!
So, listen.
Someone's got to make the arrangements.
So what do you say, Tony?
Can I be your manager?
Vince, it's me and you.
Tony, this is great.
Really great.
This is the greatest chance you got in your life.
Okay, Vince, thanks.
Wow!
Me and Benny Foster.
Whoo!
I got to tell someone.
I got to tell someone or I'll bust.
Yeah, what?
It can wait.
This is it!
This is where Benny Foster works out.
Oh, I'm kind of disappointed.
Why?
This is the ex-champ's gym.
I thought it would smell different or something.
Be a little classier.
Are you kidding?
The stalls in the bathroom-- they got doors.
Oh, well, that's classy.
These must be the reporters.
My first press conference man, am I nervous.
Hey, Bobby, you must get nervous sometimes when you go on stage.
What do you do to get out of it?
I got this little loosening-up exercise I do.
Gets all the tension out of me.
You want me to show you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, here we go.
I think I'll stick with nervous.
Hey, Tony, want to punch the bag, loosen up?
No, I'm all dressed up.
I'll get sweaty.
No, come on, it'll do you good.
Come on.
Okay, just once.
I'll hold it.
He's right-- I do feel better.
: I told you you would.
Tony, I don't know what you're so nervous about for, you know.
The guy is 38 years old.
You're going to drop him easy.
I don't want to drop him easy.
Why not?
Cause he don't deserve to be embarrassed.
I mean, not only was he a great fighter, he was one of the nicest guys to ever wear a cup.
I want this guy to do good.
Tony, I don't know much about boxing, but, uh, generally speaking, I mean, the better he does, the worse you do.
Hmm, that's something to think about.
Tony!
Hey, we make a great team, don't we?
I mean, with my muscle and his brains, we can't lose.
It's the other way around, Vince.
Right.
Listen, I'm going to need some help in Tony's corner, fight night.
Now, any of you guys ever work a fight?
I was married.
Close enough.
Fine.
Hey, champ!
That's him, that's Benny Foster.
Yeah?
That's him!
Will you look at the chicks he's got with him?
He may not be as out of shape as we thought.
Oh, you guys kill me.
I mean, yore really jumping to conclusions, you know that?
For all you know, those women might be his manager and his trainer.
His accountant and his lawyer?
His Tuesday and his Wednesday.
Tony!
This is it.
Go get 'em, Tiger.
Go get em.
This is Tony Banta.
Tony, this is the great I know who this is.
Man, it's great to see you again, champ.
Gee.
Have we met before?
Yeah, at your fight with Martini.
I, uh I got a bad memory.
Oh, you remember.
You fought him in the Garden.
Middleweight, five-ten, good left hook I remember him, but I just can't remember you.
Oh well, it was the night of the fight.
I was sitting in the audience.
When you came out, you looked right at me.
I slapped you on the back.
That was you?
Yeah!
Hey, glad to see you again.
Hey, I want you to meet my friends, Cathy and Rita.
Well, uh this here is my friend Elaine.
Hi.
Tony is my first middleweight.
Hey, uh, sweet kid.
Oh, I finally made it.
Mistaken for cheap.
Hey, should we get started?
Sure!
Oh, thanks for asking!
You're welcome.
Okay, everybody, let's get seated.
Gotta get this started here.
You know, I never did like press conferences.
I never was too good at these kind of things.
Anyway, as you know, I'm making a comeback, coming out of retirement, and you're probably wondering why, uh "Why is the old man going to fight again?
He's over the hill; he's too old".
Is it because I miss the money, fame excitement?
Yeah.
But there's more to it than that, really.
See, I wouldn't have the guts to make a comeback like this if it wasn't for the inspiration of a brave little guy, Brian Sims.
Hey, Brian, come on in here.
Everybody wants to meet you.
You see, a couple of months ago, Brian writes me a letter saying that I'm his hero his hero.
Asked me to send an autographed picture to him at the hospital.
We spent a lot of time together those weeks before his operation, and he made it.
He pulled through like a champ.
But now he's got another operation, a real tough one.
Brian knows what's ahead of him, and he's scared.
He's a gutsy fighter, though.
He's tough.
He's gonna give it his best shot.
And I'm coming back to give it my best shot.
I'm going to fight this fight for Brian.
Oh, uh I almost forgot.
My opponent, uh, Tony Banta.
Brian, meet Mr. Banta.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Banta.
Hey, Banta!
You made the afternoon paper.
Whoo-whoo!
Nice shot of the wheelchair, ain't it?
This writer says maybe you got a chance of beating Foster.
Wouldn't that be something?
Beating the ex-champ?
Crushing the comeback of one of America's most beloved athletes and breaking the heart of a sick little kid all in one fight.
Whoo, I bet you're excited.
That's it-- I know what I got to do.
Don't try to talk me out of it, either.
I gave it a lot of thought.
I'm going to give that kid my kidney.
Huh?
Tony!
No, I'm serious.
I thought about this and I know what I got to do.
I can get along without a kidney anyway.
Sure, you've come this far without a brain.
Hey, Tony, he's already got a donor.
He doesn't need your kidney.
You think he needs anything else?
Banta I, for one, am glad you're fighting this fight, because every time I bet against you, it's like a trip to the bank.
In fact, you furnished my living room.
I look over at my sofa, I see the Rodriguez fight.
I look over at my armchair, I see the Jefferson fight.
My little end tables are the Camillio brothers.
If it wasn't for your career, I'd be living in a bare apartment.
This fight with Foster is going to be a 23-inch color TV with remote control.
Hmm-hmm!
I love you, you little gold mine, you.
Jeff, come here.
What do you want, Louie?
Take cab 316 over to my bookie.
Put down Mmm, mmm, mmm $400 on Benny Foster.
I'm on my way.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's make that a 27-inch.
Ma's eyes ain't what they used to be.
$500 on Foster.
Okay.
Yeah!
Don't let him get to you, Tony.
You know how when you turn over one of those rocks and you see those slimy, crawly things underneath?
You know, the kind that make you go "yuck"?
Louie makes those things go "yuck".
Aw, man, I don't know.
You know, I'm fighting since I'm 14 years old.
Nobody ever paid any attention to me.
I finally get a fight where people will notice me, and everybody wants me to lose.
I even want me to lose.
Wait a minute.
What'd you just say?
You want to lose?
This changes everything.
Now, follow me here.
We all know that when a loser wants to win, naturally he loses.
It's a law of the universe.
Banta's proven this time and time again.
But when a loser wants to lose now, now, pay attention because this gets real tricky.
If a loser wants to lose, since he is a loser, the only way that he can stay a loser is to win.
Ergo Banta, the loser in question, wanting as he does to lose, has to win.
As perverse and unnatural as this sounds, I have to bet on Banta.
Jeff, Jeff, 316, come in, come in.
Yeah, Louie.
Put the money on Banta.
That's it.
I'm starting to think the only thing I can do is pull out of this fight while I still can.
I'm no quitter, but I just ain't got the heart for this fight anymore.
Hey, now, Tony, now, listen to me.
This is a great opportunity for you.
You may never have another chance like this.
No, no, no, let me finish.
Think of those boxers, huh?
All those guys out there over the years, fighting their hearts out because they love the sport.
You know, if you don't fight this fight, and give it all you got, you don't belong in the company of those men.
You don't deserve to call yourself a boxer.
You know, you're right, Alex.
You're absolutely right.
You know, I'm going in that ring and I'm going to give it everything I got.
And I'm going to win that fight.
Put the money on Foster.
Come on, Banta!
Left!
Left!
Attaboy, Tony!
You got him, you got him!
You're looking real good!
Nice shot, Tony!
Put one over here, put one over here!
Here we go!
Here we go!
Attaboy, Tony, Attaboy!
You're doing good!
You got him!
You got him!
Looking good, Tony.
looking   Hey, Tony, Tony, you're doing great.
Yeah, you're showing them real class, class.
Spit!
You're killing him, you're killing him.
Go after that eye.
Work on his eye.
Yeah, just keep after him.
You keep after him.
I think he's in trouble.
He's going to go down.
Could we please talk about something else?
There's no rule that says you got to talk about boxing between rounds.
Okay, okay, do you think we should get out of NATO?
I just wish he wasn't here.
Who?
You know who-- the kid.
Last round, I could feel his eyes on me.
Tony, Tony, the kid understands boxing.
He expects you to be in there fighting your hardest.
Cover yourself!
Don't let up!
Get your guard up!
Keep your guard up!
He may throw something at you.
Hey!
What?
What's NATO?
No mercy, Tony!
Four Five Six Seven Get up.
Eight nine ten.
You're out.
The winner!
Winner.
They know who did it.
Okay  Everybody, no more questions.
That's enough questions for tonight.
You want to ask Tony anything else, hail his cab.
That way he gets to put it on the meter.
Hey congratulations!
What a fight!
You made a name for yourself tonight.
I think I'm leaving.
You're going to bum me out.
Alex, man, I just don't feel much like celebrating.
Hey, Tony You want to see the kid?
Oh, the perfect end to a perfect day.
No, it might do you some good to talk to him, that's all.
No, I don't think I could handle it, Al.
I'm not saying it would be easy, but it could help.
You need someone on whose mercy to throw yourself.
Maybe you're right.
I would like to tell him to his face how sorry I am.
If he'll come?
Yeah, he's right next door in Benny's dressing room.
I'll talk to him.
Thanks, Alex.
All right?
I appreciate it.
Boy, am I ever glad to see you here.
Thanks, I'm glad to be here.
Yeah?
Yeah?
You wanted to see me, Mr. Banta?
Yeah, Brian, come on in.
How's the champ doing?
He still can't count to three, but he'll be okay.
Yeah, well, I just wanted you to know it was a lucky punch.
No, no, it wasn't.
Yeah, it was.
He hurt me good-- look at these bruises.
I'm sore all over.
You knocked him cold.
I'm real sorry about that.
No, really.
Benny's a class guy, and I'm as sorry as you are to see his career come to an end.
Benny wouldn't have wanted me to go out there and fight this halfway.
I mean, look, I don't get that many fights.
I mean, I can't even make a living at it.
I got to drive a cab at night.
Benny lost to a hack?
Yeah, so, like, this was the biggest opportunity I ever got in my life, you know.
So I went out and I gave it my all.
You know.
But right now, the fight means nothing compared to you forgiving me.
I mean you know, when I was a little kid, there were boxers I idolized, boxers I hated.
And I never thought I'd grow up to be the kind of boxer some little kid would hate.
Come on, what do you say?
Give me a break, can't you forgive me?
Where'd you get a punch like that!
What'd you hit me with?
The ball bearings from my wheelchair.
Hey, kid, you may not understand this, but I'm kind of glad you did it.
I think I feel better.
Come here and I'll make you feel terrific.
Wait a minute, kid, wait a minute You knocked out my fighter-- now I got no hero.
You know how hard it is to get a fighter to come to the hospital?
We keep getting singers.
Hey!
Stop running.
If I stop running, you'll hit me again.
You catch on fast for a cabdriver.
Hey, kid, wait a minute.
Maybe I could be your fighter.
Nah, I've seen your record.
Hey, kid Maybe I'll take some tips from you and I'll win more.
I doubt it.
Are you serious?
Sure I am.
You mean you'd come visit me and let me watch you work out at the gym and stuff like that?
It could be arranged.
And you'd come to the hospital when I have my operation?
You bet, I'll be there.
It's a deal.
Okay, it's a deal.
I'll stick around until you lose one.
That could be weeks.
Hey, everybody!
Hey, what do you say?
So, how do you like the Sunshine Cab Company?
How soon can we leave?
So where have you guys been?
I took Brian to his first hockey game.
He didn't like it, though.
Too much skating between fights.
Banta you crumb.
You louse.
You bug.
Your little escapade in the ring cost me a color television.
But I'm warning you, Banta, I'm going to get that set, and I'm going to get it from you because from now on, your messages are going to cost more, your phone calls are going to cost more.
You might as well just hang a sign around your neck right now that says, "shake me down".
Who's the kid?
Brian Sims.
Brian, this is Louie De Palma.
I don't want to interrupt you, I like what you're saying.
Oh!
So you think that Banta's a bum, too, huh?
Yeah how about a shake on it?
All right.
Better yet, a hug.
Oh!
Now, that's what I call a good kid.
Hey How come you didn't punch him like you punched me?
I did better-- I got his wallet.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hey, guys, my play got reviewed last night.
Yeah?
Take a look at this.
It's terrific.
All those weeks of hard work-- they finally paid off.
Well, what's it say?
"The 88th Street Actors' Workshop revival "of Arthur Miller's timeless classic Death of a Salesman is a dog".
That's terrible.
Oh, just keep reading, keep reading.
"The staging is dull, "the pacing awkward, the direction thoughtless and the acting unbalanced".
Don't let this go to your head.
Forget it, forget it.
Just go right down to here.
"In spite of the ineptness surrounding him, "Bobby Wheeler manages to give us "a marvelous portrayal of Biff Loman, "which should serve as an example of excellence for his fellow workshop members to emulate".
Hey, wow!
Oh, that is some review.
Thanks.
The only thing that's bothering me is I always thought this critic was a jerk.
I guess I was wrong.
Hey, we won!
Yeah?
Oh.
Hey, Brian!
You're looking at the kid who drove in the game-winning run in one of the greatest baseball games of all time.
Oh?
It was no big deal.
No big deal?
Brian came to bat in the bottom of the ninth inning.
Bases loaded, two outs, tie game.
Talk about pressure.
Most kids would've choked, but not Brian.
He came through on the very first pitch.
It hit me.
Got him to first, drove in the winning run.
All I did was get hit by a pitch.
Yeah, but you had that pitcher psyched out.
I struck out four times.
Made him cocky.
When you got it, you got it.
That's the way to talk.
Hey, so, uh, did you ask your foster parents about the movies on Sunday?
Yeah, it's okay.
Okay, come on, I'll buy you a hot chocolate.
Hey.
you're coming to the gym tomorrow, right?
Can't.
Tomorrow's my Scarsdale day.
Scarsdale day?
What's that mean?
Every Tuesday, Brian hangs out at the Scarsdale playgrounds, meeting rich kids.
Why is that?
Rich kids have rich parents.
He figures if he hangs around the kids, gets invited home, stays with the family, he'll get himself adopted.
Oh.
You know, you don't have to be rich to adopt kids.
You know that, don't you?
They do to adopt me.
With a face like this, I'm shooting for big bucks.
You think you're gonna get adopted 'cause of your face?
Are you kidding?
Look at these dimples.
Ehh, not bad.
Not bad?
Look at them in a better light.
You're right-- they're great dimples.
So, he's got to find parents quick.
You know, the older you get, the harder it is.
Yeah, most people going to adoption agencies are looking for babies.
Yeah, in this racket you're over the hill at seven.
I'm almost eight.
I thought you were nine.
Uh-oh.
How'd you know that?
Your social worker told me.
Whew.
I was afraid it showed.
You're holding up very well for nine.
Thanks, Alex.
I got to go.
Hey, Jeff.
Can you run him down to Brooklyn?
I'm a little busy right now, Tony.
Please?
Kid's got the cutest dimples.
I don't understand why nobody wants to adopt him.
Hey, Tony, you ever thought of adoption?
I have parents.
I think, I just think, he meant adopting Brian.
Are you kidding?
I'm not even married.
No, you don't have to be married to adopt.
Single people do it all the time now.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You think they'd let me adopt him?
Well, I don't know, Tony.
Have you spent much time around kids?
Sure.
I went to grade school with hundreds of them.
Oh, that's You know I think you ought to think about it.
You'd make a great father.
Wow.
Me a dad.
Oh, no.
What?
The Long Island Bulletin really let me have it.
What?
"Bobby Wheeler must have a terrible case of indigestion "from all the scenery chewing he did last night.
I know I do".
Well, at least nobody reads a rag like the Long Island Bulletin.
All right, listen up.
I got a few extra copies of the Long Island Bulletin.
Get 'em while they're hot.
Hey, Wheeler, I brought you some Rolaids.
It's us.
All right, guys.
How are you?
I'm so glad you showed up.
I really appreciate it.
I'm nervous as hell about this.
Oh, Tony, just relax.
Come on, I'll get some beers or something.
Hey, Tony, did you talk to the social worker yet?
Yeah, I talked to her.
She says I've got a pretty good chance of adopting this kid.
All I got to do now is pitch it to Brian.
Hey, Tony, you sure you want us here?
Oh, absolutely.
I mean, Elaine, it's gonna help having you here because you know so much about kids.
And Alex and Bobby, because you guys are my closest friends.
And Jim becau-- did I invite you?
No.
I thought it was an oversight.
Jim!
Tony, is something burning?
Lunch.
Whoa!
Uh-oh.
Wow, did you burn that all by yourself?
Yeah, from scratch.
I'm impressed.
What was it?
Well, if I followed Elaine's recipe right-- meat loaf.
Tony, I told you to cook it till it looked brown.
Yeah, but it was hard to see it through all that smoke.
Well, I think I can save it.
You know, I'm so excited about this, I can't sleep at night.
I mean, the last couple days, you know what I did?
What?
Checked out schools in the area.
And I found an apartment down the hall with a bedroom.
And I mean, there's just so much to do.
Look at this guy.
Tony, just calm down.
It's going to be terrific.
Oh, sure, that's easy for you to say.
All you had to do to get kids was give birth.
Gee, I feel so guilty I took the simple way out.
That's him.
That's Brian.
You know, all of a sudden, I feel real strange doing this in front of a bunch of people, you know?
I mean, it's kind of personal.
Tony, what do you want us to do?
Could you wait in the other room?
Tony the only other room is the bathroom.
I'd really appreciate it.
Well, what the heck.
Let's give it a try.
Yo!
Jim, come on.
We're going to hide in the bathroom.
Okay, but I better warn you-- I'm good at this.
One thousand one one thousand No, no, Jim, Jim.
You're going to hide with us.
Okay, but you're making it a lot easier.
One thousand one  Tony, I made it.
I found a couple-- the Brennans-- and they're loaded.
What are you talking about?
I was at the Scarsdale playground when I met a kid.
He's staying with his aunt and uncle.
I got invited home for dinner, and now they want me to move in.
These people already said they're going to adopt you?
No, they just asked me to stay for a while but, once I'm there, they'll get used to having me around.
Have you checked this out with your foster parents?
Yeah.
I even talked to my social worker.
The agency, too.
Believe me, this little waif is home free.
What's that?
Oh, that's some meat loaf I cooked us up for lunch.
I'm a vegetarian.
When did you become a vegetarian?
When I looked at this meat loaf.
That's the Brennans.
They're waiting downstairs for me.
I got to go.
Hey, Brian, are you sure this is it?
This is what you want?
Close enough.
Hey, Brian, maybe somebody will come along who wants to adopt you-- somebody even better than the Brennans.
You mean Princess Grace answered my letter?
Oh what I mean is Brian, are you sure the Brennans are it?
I mean, is your mind made up?
I know a good deal when I see it.
Tony, I think there's someone in your bathroom.
Oh, yeah, that's Alex, Elaine, Bobby and Jim.
They had to freshen up.
Oh, yeah.
You told me they do everything together.
See you.
Bye, Brian.
Well, I got to split.
See you.
Hey.
Come on, Tony.
We're still friends.
We can still go to the games together, and I'll treat from now on.
Yeah, sure, why you know.
Sure.
See you.
We heard, Tony.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't believe Brian would do that to you, man.
Oh, just forget it.
You know, kids are impulsive.
They change their minds all the time.
Really You don't know Brian.
Oh, Tony, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Hey, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to be alone for a little while.
Yeah, okay.
We understand.
Let's go.
Sure.
We understand.
Listen.
Call me, you know?
See you, Tony.
Bye.
Ready or not, here I come!
Don't help me.
Here you go.
Hey, what a night you had.
You're getting the hang of this, huh, Banta?
Hey, Louie, if you don't mind, I'd like to drive the day shift, too.
Hey, uh, Tony want to take a break and have a cup of coffee?
Nah.
I want to hit the streets, man.
What are you trying to prove, huh?
Nothing.
I'm just trying to make some extra money.
Tony, you're not going to win Brian back by hustling more fares, you know.
You cannot compete financially with the Brennans.
I'm not competing.
I just feel like driving more since he walked out on me.
Tony, don't blame Brian.
He's just a confused little boy.
You know something?
I'm getting sick and tired of all this tolerance.
I mean, we're talking about a nine-year-old kid whose values are all messed up, and I think we should stop tolerating him just because he's had a hard life.
What are you getting so mad about, Alex?
What I'm getting mad about?
I'll tell you what I'm getting mad about.
I'm getting mad that he did this and that you let him do it, and that money perverts our values and hurts people, and that money stinks, and that I don't have any.
No, no, no, no.
Tony, Tony, look, now.
I think somebody's got to straighten that kid out.
In fact, I think you ought to go over to the Brennan house and tell the kid you're going to adopt him.
Why not?
Oh, no.
I'm not arguing with Brian over this.
Because, every time I argue with him, he outwits me.
I've seen you outwitted by a pop-top can.
Besides, I can't go intruding in on the Brennans.
I mean, number one: I'd feel uncomfortable just barging in.
Number two: I don't know how to act around people like that.
And, number three: They don't even know me.
You know, Number four you're just making excuses, and you know that.
Maybe you're right, Alex.
Maybe I'll go over there this afternoon.
That's the way to talk.
Great.
If you'll go with me.
Hmm?
Nah.
Me?
I'm not going to go over there.
Why not?
Well, number one: I'd feel uncomfortable intruding on them.
Number two: They don't even know me.
Number three: I don't know how to act around people like that.
And, number four What did you say number four was?
Mr. Brennan asked if you would wait in the library.
Is it far from here?
This is the library.
Oh, they got one in their house.
I'll tell Mr. and Mrs. Brennan you're here.
Thank you.
Wow!
Who'd build a nice house like this next to a bunch of stables?
Maybe the house was here first, and the horses moved in later.
Makes more sense.
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Alex.
Hey, Brian.
This is a great place you got here.
I'm sure here are disadvantages, too.
Aren't there?
Yeah, you're right.
The pool's overheated.
Oh, well, suffering builds character, kid.
You know?
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Brennan, this is Tony and Alex.
Oh, Tony, Alex.
It's a pleasure.
We've heard a lot about you.
Especially you, Tony.
I understand you're an excellent boxer.
I stretched it a little.
Brian says you have a very impressive knockout record.
Oh, yeah.
Once, I was out for almost an hour.
Well, I hope to be a contender someday but, right now, I make my living driving a cab.
Shall we sit down?
Please, sit.
Oh, thanks.
And what do you do, Alex?
Me?
I drive a cab also.
And you box, too?
No, I just drive a cab.
Oh, Well, what do you want to do?
Quit.
May I offer you a brandy?
Oh, you bet.
Thank you.
If you gentlemen will excuse me, I have to check on dinner.
Will you be staying?
No, I don't think so.
Well, if you change your minds, you're certainly welcome.
Thank you.
And you, young man, be sure and wash your hands before dinner.
I wish she'd take off her rings before she does that.
Well, Tony, I admit I don't know very much about boxing, but I do find Muhammad Ali interesting.
What's he doing these days?
Last time I saw him, he was in Alaska selling batteries.
Uh thank you.
You know, if you're short on brandy, I could have a beer.
Oh, no.
That's the amount of brandy you're supposed to get.
Oh right, right.
Well, I I did a lot of odd jobs while I was going through school, but I never drove a cab.
What's that like?
Well, it's a lot like boxing, only there are a lot fewer people around when you get beat up.
Uncle John, you got a long distance telephone call.
Oh, thank you.
Excuse me, Alex, Tony.
Hey, Brian, you want to go play tennis before dinner?
Sorry, Tommy.
I'm visiting with my friends.
Tony and Alex, this is Tommy, the Brennans' nephew.
Nice meeting you.
Oh, hi, Tommy.
Nice meeting you.
Before I came along, this was their idea of cute.
Catch you later.
Brian, Alex and I got to go.
You just got here.
I know, but we just wanted to stop by and see how you were doing, and you're doing great, so we're going to get out of here.
Oh, no, no, no.
Damn it, you're not going to leave here until you tell that kid what you came here to tell him.
But you see his mind's made up.
I'm sorry.
I don't buy that.
Listen kid, there are a lot more important things in this life than money, you know?
Name three.
Friends, happiness and health.
Three that money can't buy.
You're right.
He's great.
Brian, I was hoping you weren't going to be so happy here so it wasn't so terrific.
Why?
Brian, uh On your knees.
I've been thinking about this a lot, and I didn't mention it to you before because well, I had to make sure it was going to work, and because you had the Brennans and all but I think you're terrific.
I'd be so proud if you were my son.
We'd have great times together.
And I'd do,,, I'd do my very best to make your life the best it can be.
Geez, what kind of choice is this for an eight-year-old?
A nine-year-old.
Oh, we're going to get nasty.
So you don't want me to be your dad?
You make it hard.
Yeah, well, he can make it a lot tougher, you know.
How?
Well, by mentioning a few things like all the great times that you two have had together.
Things like that, huh?
Hmm?
Down on my knees?
Like how big a part of your life Tony is, and vice versa.
And how he wants to adopt you because he loves you, not because he feels sorry for you.
And maybe, just maybe, because of a feeling that he has, and that I have, and maybe even you have, that you would be a lot happier with Tony than you could be with these people.
Tony, I'm sorry.
But I've got to think about my future.
You're right.
Let's get out of here.
Nice meeting you, Mrs. Brennan.
Oh.
Leaving so soon?
Yeah.
We just remembered we got something else to do.
Well, I'm glad you dropped by.
Come again.
Oh, thanks.
Listen, if you ever think about adopting an older kid-- like, 42 years old-- call me.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Alex.
How you doing?
No, man, no.
I'm not in the mood to see anything I got to think about.
And I already seen Horse Feathers anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
I'll give you a call.
Okay.
Bye, man.
Man, the traffic in this city is incredible!
Brian, you changed your mind.
Sure did.
Have any extra hangers?
This is great!
I knew you'd come through.
There's more important things in this world than money.
Oh, man.
Am I happy to hear you say that.
Hey, Brian, I swear, I'm going to make this work.
You'll see.
Hey, did the Brennans take it hard?
They'll get over it.
Well, maybe I should call them and let them know that you got here okay, huh?
Don't bother.
Nah.
They'll worry if I don't do it.
Tony, I said don't.
What's going on, Brian?
Oh, you're never going to believe this, but they didn't want to adopt me.
Do you have any shoe trees?
They didn't want you?
How come?
I don't know.
I guess they got no taste.
I'm going to need a drawer.
I see.
So you're ready to settle for me now?
You got it, Dad.
Why don't you burn something up for dinner?
"Dad" nothing.
I ain't going to be nobody's second choice.
Sure, you're ready to come back to me now 'cause they don't want you.
Hey, come on, Pop.
Lighten up.
Hey, Brian, tell me something.
What happens tomorrow if a family even richer than the Brennans comes along, and they want to adopt you?
You'll go with them?
Hey, come on, Tony, remember?
We're buddies.
Think of all the good times we can have together.
Don't hit me with that smile, Brian.
Dimples either.
I know all those tricks, man, and none of them are going to work.
You know, I've taken some shots in my life, but the ones you've given me-- they topped them all.
So just pack what you unpacked and hit the road, pal.
Tony, I didn't want to have to say this, but you backed me into a corner.
I love you, Tony.
There's such a thing as being too easy.
Hey, wait a minute.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
Let's cut these cards right now-- see whether you stay or leave.
High card wins.
I can't be any fairer than that, can I?
Yeah, you're right.
That's fair.
Okay, but I'll tell you something, Brian.
This is it.
This is the final one.
Win or lose, you got to stick by the consequences.
Okay.
Come on, high card.
Come on, high card.
You go first.
It's an eight.
It's a king.
I win.
I get to keep you.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Excuse me.
I'm here to see Mr. Mackenzie about the secretarial position.
Yes, ma'am.
If you'll just wait over here with the other contestants we'll get to you as soon as we can.
Thank you.
Oh, uh by the way, I hope you get the job.
You're my favorite.
: Oh Oh Yes, ma'am.
You must be here for the secretarial position.
If you'll just come over here.
And by the way I hope you get the job.
You're my favorite.
And I'm not just saying that because you've got great bagonzas.
I can't believe the way Louie is kissing up to these women just because one of them is going to be the boss's secretary.
Oh Bad news, Louie.
What?
I got robbed.
Huh?
Tony, you okay, man?
Nah, it was nothing.
I'm fine, really.
How much did they get?
Close to everything-- Nice going, dough-brain.
You just blew your biggest booking night in six months.
Here, fill out this report and give it back to me, momo.
What are you getting so mad at me for?
The guy could have blown my brains out.
So could a good sneeze.
Come on, hey, what happened?
What happened?
What's the matter?
Was it a big guy?
Were you scared?
Nah, it was nothing.
He was a kid.
He couldn't have been Yeah, was he armed?
He put his hand in his pocket, pointed it at me.
It could have been a gun.
I don't know.
What was his name?
He didn't say.
Sounds like a pro.
Well, uh, did he say anything at all?
Yeah, he said, "Give me your money or I'll kill you".
You mean he gave you an out?
Excuse me.
I was just instructed to tell you, you can all leave.
The position has been filled.
You're the boss's new secretary?
See that, everybody?
My favorite got it.
All right, all right, all right, you heard the lady.
Beat it, rejects.
Come on, come on, get out of here.
This ain't no coffee klatsch.
Come on, hyah!
Hyah!
Yackavay.
Yackavay?
Yackavay?
She spoke Latka's language.
Excuse me.
Isn't this great, Latka?
A girl from back home.
I know.
Goody-goody.
Latka Gravas.
Hi.
Hi.
What did she say, Latka?
She say her name is Simka Dahblitz.
Not the Simka Dahblitz.
No, certainly not.
No, sir, no.
Hey, you speak English?
English, yes.
Hey, terrific!
How long have you been in this country?
Oh, thank you.
Don't mention it.
Latka, ask her if she still needs a job.
Doing what, Louie?
I think I might be able to find something around here that would interest her.
You like to go with boss man make big, shiny new quarter?
There's no romance left.
Uh, Simka, would you like to sit down?
Yeah, sit down, please.
Thank you.
What brought you to our country?
Simka?
America.
Oh, I see.
She say the reason she come to America is to-to, because, oh in my country the mountain people are all moving into the villages and there is much hatred.
Why?
Because no one likes the mountain people.
Why?
Because they are mountain people.
Hey, have you heard this one?
Eh, how many mountain people do it take to milk the goat?
Well?
I'm sure I don't know.
Five-- one to hold the beeshees and four to raise the goat up and down.
Hold the beeshees.
You like, Simka?
Oh, yes, that was very funny.
Well, Simka, I am going to show you America.
Oh, goody-goody.
Come, I will teach you how to speak English, so you can speak good like me.
And we will see everything and do everything, okay?
So, don't go away and I will be right back.
I just going to get my coat.
Don't go away now.
Simka, you and Latka are getting along so well.
I think he likes you.
Is very bad.
Oh, no, no, no-- like is good.
No, you do not understand.
I am a mountain person.
Oh, yeah?
Did you hear the one about how many mountain people it takes Jim!
I think she's heard it.
But I thought you said you left your country because to get away from the mountain people.
No, I left my country because to get away from the flatlanders who hate us.
Please, please don't tell Latka.
Okay!
As they say in America, we're ready when you are.
Bye-bye.
Hey, Latka.
Bye.
Latka, where you going to take her?
Oh, I am going to show her all the sights of New York City.
I'm going to show her the lights of Broadway and the Statue of Liberty and the apartment of a lonely, lonely man.
Here we go.
Thanks.
Thanks, Tom.
Hey, there you are.
Guys, how you doing?
Hey, Tom, another glass.
One more glass.
Have a seat.
How did your dinner with Latka and Simka go last night?
Oh, it was terrific.
Yeah?
They're such a cute little couple.
A "cute little couple"?
Yeah.
You think they'd like to be called "a cute little couple"?
Latka told me to call them that.
He said that if they ever get married, he's going to put that on their mailbox.
You know, I've never seen Latka so happy.
He runs around the garage singing, laughing slapping people on the back Pinching people on the rear end.
Oh.
Takes me by surprise every time he does it.
Oh?
I'm starting to get used to it.
I'm starting to look forward to it.
Oh!
Hey, Tony, want to go in the back and play some air hockey?
Something I said?
What is it?
Hey, uh, can I play?
Hey, Jim, it's a game for two guys.
You know that.
Okay, I'll, uh I'll just watch.
It makes me nervous when you watch, you know?
Okay, I'll close my eyes.
It throws my game off, like, even if you're in the same room you know.
Okay, uh I'll just stay here.
Fine.
Just as long as I'm included.
Yo!
Oh, hi, Simka, Latka.
Sit down.
Hey, how are you two getting along, huh?
Very good.
Aren't we a cute couple?
As bugs' ears, yes, you are.
Oh, we had such A-one day today.
Oh, Latka showed me many things I never in my life think I see.
Yeah?
Well, where have you been?
Well, we went to the Automat, we went to the subway, and we went to car wash.
The usual tourist traps, I see.
Oh, and also we went to see a musical show called Grease.
Oh, how did you like it?
I was disappointed.
Well, he thought it was going to be about mechanics.
Would you like a refreshment?
Oh, yes, I like a mushi please.
Isn't this something?
Here you come all the way to this country and then you have a relationship with somebody from back home.
I know.
It's very nice, but I am I am afraid that it all must end when the truth comes out.
You mean Latka still doesn't know that you're a A mountain.
Yeah, a mountain?
No, but I think I must tell him very soon.
Yeah, the longer you wait, the worse it can get.
Oh, yeah.
I know what you mean.
You're saying that if she doesn't tell him she's a mountain person and he finds out she's a mountain person, he's going to be upset.
Not only because she's a mountain person, but because she didn't tell him she's a mountain person.
I have my moments.
Although it does cost me.
I think I'll go home and sleep for a while.
So long, Jim.
Good-bye.
Simka, trust Latka.
Okay, here you go.
Is mushi.
Well, what have you all been talking about?
Not me, I hope.
Latka, I have something to tell you, which I don't know how I'm going to be telling you.
Ya?
Is it that you love me?
No.
You know those mountain people jokes you have been telling?
Yeah.
Well, I am a mountain person!
And this is for my mother!
And this is for my father!
This is for my grandfather!
I hope you have a small family.
And this is for stepping on my heart and telling me you do not like me anymore because I am a mountain person.
I did not say I don't like you.
You are ashamed to be with me now.
That is not true.
Then look at me, Latka, and tell me nothing has changed.
Nothing has changed.
Look at me, Latka.
It's hard it's hard to do this when you keep moving.
So long, Latka.
Wait, wait, don't go.
Louie?
Huh?
I want to go home.
Can I please go home?
I have I'm not feeling too well.
What's the matter?
I have the blues.
It don't work that way, Latka.
There's only three reasons to leave work early.
Loss of limb, excessive bleeding, and heart attack.
And heart attack is a judgment call I make.
Alex Elaine, I have a problem.
Oh!
Well.
Can I please talk to you?
Sit down.
You've come to the right people.
Now, you just sit down.
Is this where you Is this where you want me to sit?
Yeah.
Uh it's about Simka.
Oh.
Ever since we broke up, I am feel terrible.
I cannot eat I cannot sleep Well, Latka, why don't you just go to Simka and ask her to forgive you?
I mean, you still like her, don't you?
Of course, but, you see, in my country, there is nothing worse a person can do than to date a mountain girl.
My mother would rather that I date a pig than a mountain girl.
It would have been better if a pig would have walked into garage and said, "Hello, Latka".
Then I could at least call up my family and say, "Hello, yes, I am dating a pig".
They would not have been crazy about it, but at least, they would have welcomed it into the family, after a while, especially after we had children.
Um Alex, um Huh?
Do you want to say anything to him?
Say anything?
You want me to you want me tell the guy how to live his life?
Please, Alex.
I knew that this was gonna happen.
Look, Latka, why don't you just stop a minute and think about Simka, hmm?
Think about the week you just spent with her.
Think about the places that you went to.
Think about the way she laughs.
Think about her, uh Think about the way her hand feels in yours.
Think about her the way her hair smells.
The nape of her neck.
Think about how she looks at you when you hold her.
How her eyelash tickles your cheek.
Think about all that.
If you can think about all that and still not get off your yaktabe and go over there and give her a big make-up kiss then I wish you'd tell me right now, because I'm beginning to think that I'm going to do it.
Ha-ha!
All right.
You're right, Alex.
I'm going to tell her.
Louie.
Louie.
What?
Louie, I need some time off.
What for?
'Cause I'm in love.
Latka, if I left the garage every time my spokes needed greasing, I'd never get any work done.
Now, get back to your cab.
Louie, damn it, now listen to me!
This is the last time you're going to do anything like that.
Wait, wait.
Alex, Alex, no yelling and screaming and fighting.
I mean, let a lady handle this.
Louie, um, if you don't let Latka off this afternoon, I'm going to report you to the board of labor relations, and I'm going to tell them every rotten thing that you've ever done in this garage.
Ha!
You report me to the board of labor relations, and I'll fire you.
You fire me, and I'll report you to the union.
You report me to the union, and I'll see to it that you get a rotten cab out of this garage every night.
You give me a rotten cab out of the garage every night, and I'll report you to the hack bureau.
You report me to the hack bureau, and I'll kick you in the shin.
You kick me in the shin, and I'll kick you where you live.
: Get out of here, Latka.
Hello, Latka.
Simka, where have you been?
I thought maybe you change your mind about meeting me.
No, I'm late because I have a job now.
Oh, a job.
Sit down.
So, what do you do?
I am working at the race track.
They have a rake which goes around and cleans up after the horses, and they need people to sit on it to make it heavy.
I am the one in the middle.
I told you that America was the land of opportunity.
It's good to see you again, Latka.
It's good to see you, too.
I have good news for you.
I have decided that I love you and I don't care that you are mountain.
I am willing to disgrace myself to be with you.
I called my family and told them I am dating a mountain girl.
My mother, she disowned me.
My grandpa put a curse on me.
My brother said he never want to see me again, and my crazy uncle Dahbi gave me his blessings.
So I am all yours.
You mountain people sure have a strange way of expressing great joy.
I am sorry, Latka, but we cannot be dating again.
No, no, you don't understand.
I just said it's all right.
No, no, you do not understand.
We cannot see each other again.
Well, sure, maybe not out in the street in broad daylight, but No, Latka.
Why not?
Because of your feelings, I will always be mountain to you.
I will get over that.
And because you will never believe I am as good as you.
You are in the ballpark.
And because, by now, I have found somebody else.
In fact, he is meeting me here tonight.
Does he know about you?
Yes, he does, and you know what?
He doesn't care.
Simka.
Oh, John.
Oh, Latka Gravas, this is John Hannen.
Pleased to meet you.
John is the man I was telling you about.
This is the fellow you are dating?
That's right.
He sure is gorgeous.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You two met on the rake?
No, I'm a surgeon.
Oh, a surgeon.
It's no good.
He is never home.
You always want to be with him.
He won't be there for you.
I only work two days a week.
It's no good.
He's always home, always getting underfoot, always in the way when you're cleaning house.
No priva  I have a housekeeper, and I spend most of my day during the week sailing.
Do you have a sister?
Are you ready to go?
In a sec.
Well I'm very sorry, Latka.
So am I. Bye.
Bye-bye.
Wait, wait, Simka.
Wait.
Can I talk to you just for a minute?
Just for a minute.
I just want to tell you something.
I I hope that you are very happy, and I have learned my lesson.
I think you are a wonderful girl, and I am proud to be the man whose life you have totally wrecked.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
I've got to close her up, Latka, but you can stay and have a drink if you like.
Thank you.
Hey, Tommy.
Yeah?
Could could you please play the song that me and Simka used to love together?
Yeah, which one was that one?
A-7.
* Summer lovin' had me a blast * * Summer lovin' happened so fast * * I met a girl Tommy Yeah, Latka?
You want to hear a joke?
Sure, go ahead.
How does a mountain how does a mountain girl make love?
I don't know.
Like an angel.
* Tell me more, tell me more * Did you get very far?
* Tell me more, tell me more * Like does he have a car?
* Dop, de-dop, de-dop, de-do-do-de-dop * * She swam by me, she got a cramp * * He ran by me, got myself damp * * I saved her life, she nearly drowned * * He showed off, splashing around *   Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
please.
I can't believe it.
Excuse me?
You're Nora Chandless.
Do I know you?
Bobby Wheeler.
I'm an actor.
Do you know where I can find a cab driver, Mr. Wheeler?
I have an appointment to make.
Very Good.
I'm sorry.
Hey, where was it you said you wanted to go again?
Boy, this is some big coincidence.
You're one of the biggest actors' managers in New York.
And me, a young, talented, yet-to-be-discovered actor in the same cab.
I'll be talking about it for weeks.
I guess it's not such a coincidence, huh?
Especially since I cruise the theater district a lot, hoping to meet someone like you.
Not only did I meet someone like you, I met you.
Now you can't get any more like you than you, can you?
I scored a point, huh?
Yeah, a partial point.
You have a nice smile.
Oh, yeah?
You can tell from back there, huh?
Yeah, I'm looking at your eight-by-ten glossy taped to the seat here.
Do you mind a suggestion?
No.
You kidding?
Go ahead.
I'd do something about the mustache and the missing teeth.
Oh, someone must have drawn on the thing again.
It's signed, "As always, Louie".
Look, uh Miss Chandless, I know what I'm about to say is going to sound pushy and aggressive, but at this stage in my career I've run out of humble.
Hey, please don't start pitching, okay?
I get that from actors all the time.
I can't tell anything about their acting ability from their pitches, so Okay, I'm sorry.
And you're absolutely right.
A New York Times reviewer once said that I was the most natural young actor he'd seen in years.
You're pitching.
That's not pitching.
That's lying.
Look, I'm performing two nights a week There's no stopping you, is there?
in a little theater in Brooklyn.
Now, I don't want to impose, but I am really good.
Well, look, I hope you get a really big break some day, all right?
Oh, I have!
I've gotten a huge break!
What?
Your getting into this cab!
Green light.
Oh, yeah.
Except you know, one other time I came close.
I hate to be a name-dropper, but once I almost picked up Mike Nichols.
So did I. What?
I like your laugh.
Oh, yeah?
And that's my weakest feature.
All right.
So, uh, Tell me about this play you're in two nights a week.
What's it called?
Stall.
It's an experimental play about 12 people stuck in a stalled elevator.
It raises an age-old question: which is the greater agony-- to be stuck in an elevator or to be watching a show about being stuck in an elevator?
I'm not going to tell you any more 'cause you may not want to come and see me in it.
Well, I'll tell you what.
If I'm in the neighborhood and I get a chance, I'll try to catch it.
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
You know, gave you my best shot.
Thanks for listening.
I said I'll try to see it.
Oh, I know, and thanks.
Hey, you're here.
That will be $2.50, please.
Wait a minute.
You don't think I'll try to see it, do you?
I think you're just trying to be nice to me.
I am not trying to be nice to you.
I said I'll try to see it and I mean, I'll try to see it.
You know, you don't have to let me down easy.
I'm used to disappointment.
I am not letting you down easy.
I am telling you that I'll probably be there.
Hey, if you're not, it'll be okay.
It'll be all right.
It will not be all right, damn it.
I'll be there.
Hi, guys.
Hey, uh, Tony?
Alex called me this afternoon.
Oh, yeah?
What did he say?
Well, he said to say hello to you guys and the skiing's great, and he misses us, and that he's never coming back.
What do you mean he's never coming back?
That's what he said.
Come on, you must have misunderstood.
No.
What were his exact words?
Oh, well, his exact words were "I'm never, ever, ever, never, never coming back".
You sure he didn't say "I'm never, ever, ever, never coming back, ha-ha"?
You know how Alex likes to kid.
I don't think he was kidding.
I know how Alex feels.
I once left a city and moved to a commune to get away from it all.
We had acres and acres of beautiful, unspoiled land to plant and harvest and do our own thing on.
Well, that sounds really nice.
Yeah.
Unfortunately, everybody's thing was standing around, getting loaded.
You mean, nobody did any farming, huh?
Yeah.
There was this one guy who farmed when he was loaded.
One day I caught him trying to plant a chicken.
That might be all fine and well with you, Jim, but I know that Alex is coming back.
But Latka, he said that the skiing's great and he's never been happier.
It's all right, Elaine.
I know he will be back.
He's breathing clean, fresh air.
He will be back.
And meeting a lot of attractive women.
I'm going to miss him.
Hey, guys!
She came to the play last night just like she said she was going to.
Who?
Nora Chandless.
Who's Nora Chandless?
Didn't I talk to you about this last night?
I mean, I know I talked to somebody about it.
Th-that was me.
Who's Nora Chandless?
She's a personal manager.
She's handled the careers of some of the most successful New York actors there are.
She is a star-maker, and if she decides to represent me, I'd be on my way.
Hey, Bobby, what's the big deal about this lady?
Don't you already have somebody that takes care of you-- that fat, bald guy?
That fat, bald guy, he's my agent.
See, Nora Chandless, she's a personal manager.
She'll take control over my career.
If she can find it.
You know, Louie it's not like I'm invisible.
I'm doing this play, and I did that athlete's foot commercial for television.
What athlete's foot commercial?
You mean the one with the row of feet?
Yeah.
You've seen it?
Yeah, I seen it.
Which foot was yours?
The one on the far left.
I should have known-- the one that was overacting.
Coming Sunshine Cab Co., drivers' lounge.
Who, Bobby Wheeler?
No, he doesn't live here anymore.
I do!
Get out of here!
I live here!
I live here!
Hey, this is Bobby Wheel Yeah?
Yeah?
Hey, hey, thank you.
Uh thank you very much.
That was Nora Chandless's secretary.
Nora Chandless wants to see me in her office right away.
All right.
See that?
Yay!
Congratulations.
Who's Nora Chandler?
Bobby, hi.
Listen, now I only have a minute.
I want to tell you, I saw you in your play last night, and everything you said is absolutely true-- it stinks.
Oh, but But wait, Okay, the rest of what you said is true, too.
You are marvelous.
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
No, I mean it.
Now, look, I'm in the middle of a meeting, so I have to be quick here, but I like what I see in you.
Yeah?
You know, I think you've got a lot of promise.
I'd really like to work with you.
You interested?
Well, I'm going to have to think about it.
Oh, you just don't know what this means to me.
Okay, now listen.
I want to give you the name and address of my photographer.
Go over there this afternoon, arrange to have some new photos taken.
Also the number of, uh my hair stylist.
Come back here later on this afternoon.
My personal secretary will take you out, pick you up a new wardrobe.
Oh, Miss Chandless Oh, I am really good, and I can't wait to prove it to you.
Good.
You can start tonight.
Here are the keys to my apartment.
See ya.
Okay I give up.
It is chess.
Damn!
I was going to guess that.
Anybody else want to try?
Here you go, Lou.
Tony I'm really worried about Alex.
Why?
He called again?
No.
That's why I'm worried.
He stopped calling.
Gosh.
I just can't even imagine the Sunshine Cab Company without Alex Rieger.
Come on, Elaine.
We still got a chance he'll come back.
You know, once you live in New York for a while, you can't get it out of your blood.
Or your clothes or your hair or your skin.
I'll miss him, too.
You know it's your fault he isn't coming back.
What are you talking about, Louie?
I'm talking about the burdens you are to him.
You're always inflicting your problems on the guy.
"Let's ask Alex.
"Let's ask Alex.
"Oh, my girlfriend-- I got a little problem, Alex.
"Aw, my kids-- aw, Alex.
"What should I do?
My nose is running.
Let's ask Alex".
It ain't that way, Lou.
No?
No.
Gee, I don't know, Tony.
Maybe Louie's right.
You know maybe we have been a burden to Alex, and maybe that's one of the reasons why he's not coming back.
Well, Elaine, if we're keeping him away, let's do something to get him back.
Okay, but what?
Let's ask Alex.
Good idea.
Bobby, so what happened?
What happened?
Yeah, I thought you were going to call me.
Yeah, I mean, did she like you?
Uh, she's going to represent me.
You must be so excited, man!
You must feel like jumping up and down and doing cartwheels and yelling from rooftops and exploding in a million pieces!
And at least smiling.
Hey, man, ain't you happy?
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Of course I'm happy.
It's just that I got a lot of work to do.
I'm auditioning for a Broadway revival.
Well, come on, Bobby, you can spare ten seconds.
I mean, this is big stuff.
Give us some details.
Well, there isn't much, you know?
Just went to her office, and-and-and she sent me to her hair stylist, and she bought me some clothes, sent me to a photographer.
Then we went to her apartment, we talked some business and then we went to bed.
Congratulations.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, Bobby, you're sleeping with your manager?
Hey, do you have to tell the whole garage?
Wheeler's sleeping with his manager!
Is she attractive?
Oh, sure, sure.
She's attractive, all right.
Well, then, Bobby, you got even more reason to be excited.
Not only have you found a manager, you've found a A great manager!
Listen, guys I don't really want to talk about it right now, you know?
Come on, Bobby, it's not like you're prostituting yourself.
Is it?
Man, hey, Bobby you okay, man?
I don't know.
Just I'm afraid that I don't feel anything for her, you know, man?
Well, uh, maybe it was just a one-time thing.
Yeah.
Maybe it was just her way of saying, "Welcome aboard".
You know, this is the biggest break of my career, and I'm supposed to be ecstatic about it.
And all I feel is cheap.
Bobby I don't know what's right, and I don't know what's wrong.
I don't even know what's going on.
Wheeler, are you saying that you're using your body to further your career?
Now, that is smart.
I'm glad you've finally figured it out that you're not going to get there on your talent.
Sometimes the best thing that you can do is to give the people in higher places anything they want.
Now I hope this lesson isn't lost on you Nardo.
Yeah, well, I can't take another step until I get a more reasonable offer.
Well, it's as simple as that.
Yeah, excuse me.
Bobby, hi.
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'm on the phone here.
No.
Somebody just walked in.
Well, I'll tell you, why don't we sleep on it?
No, no, no.
I-I can't agree to lunch until we sleep on it.
That's right, let's sleep on whether to have lunch.
Yeah, okay, bye-bye.
So, how'd the audition go, huh?
I let you down.
I let myself down.
I let Tennessee Williams down.
I let my mother and my father down.
I don't deserve to be on the stage.
I don't even deserve to live.
Oh, come on, Bobby, every actor I know comes out of audition and thinks he didn't do well.
Didn't do well?
I threw up.
During the scene on the stage.
I was late, so I grabbed a chili dog on the way over, and they rushed me right on to the stage.
I was so nervous I threw up.
I don't know, I just don't deserve a part like that anyway.
Well, I guess there's only one thing I can say to pick you up.
There's nothing you can say You got the part.
You're telling me that I got the part that I auditioned for today on Broadway as Brick?
Congratulations.
Yes.
Well, actually, I did throw up in character.
I mean, it's not like I didn't use it.
And there's nothing in the script that says old Brick can't throw up.
Oh, hey, I hope they don't want me to do that every night.
That's a lot of chili dogs.
Ooh, they really thought I was good today, huh?
Uh, in a way-- you had the part before you walked in the door.
You see, they didn't take you, then I didn't give them the actress they wanted for Maggie.
Welcome to show business.
Oh, it's everything I hoped it would be.
Bobby, come on.
Now, in the cab you said to me you wanted a great manager.
Well, you've got one.
This is what a great manager does.
Oh, no, it isn't.
Sure it is.
Great managers don't hmm-hmm-hmm with their clients.
First of all, the room you're pointing to is the kitchen.
And second of all, no good is going to come out of our having this conversation you seem to want to have right now.
Bobby, look, look, look-- if it makes you feel any better, I think you are very talented.
However, I also happen to be interested in you, uh personally.
I don't know how one affects the other.
I don't care.
Yeah, but, Nora I feel like I did a terrible thing last night.
What?
I may have slept with you to advance my career.
And what was the terrible thing you did?
Hey, Bobby, look it-- if it bothers you that much, the answer is very simple.
Obviously, we cannot maintain both a business and a personal relationship.
No, no, we can't.
Well, then, let's not even try to have both.
Oh, great!
Let's just have the relationship we both want.
Business.
Personal.
Or personal.
Or business or bismal?
Bobby I'm only kidding.
Bobby I just wan Bobby I think I'm losing a little interest here.
If you'll excuse me.
Sure.
I mean, I'd like you to leave.
Now?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm leaving.
You know, just let me understand what seems to be obvious here.
You're kicking me out, right?
Right.
And, uh, you're not my manager anymore, right?
Right.
We're not seeing each other socially, right?
That's right.
I didn't get the part I got today on Broadway, right?
Right.
I guess the pictures are out.
No pictures.
No haircut, huh?
No haircut.
Whew rough day.
Hey, look, Nora, I've lost a lot tonight.
I lost my manager I lost my job, I lost my future.
But at least I have one thing.
At least I have my self-respect.
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, yes, I do.
Oh, no you don't.
Because if I said come back, you'd come back in a second.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Try me.
Come back.
Okay.
Now you don't have your self-respect.
Good night.
Aw Okay.
So, I lost my manager.
I lost my job, I lost my future, I lost my self-respect.
But at least I have one thing left: I have my shoes.
What?
I don't know.
It's all I could think of.
But at least I have them.
And they're all mine.
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, yes, I do.
Oh, no, you don't.
Because if I said, "Give me your shoes and I'll let you come back," you'd give me your shoes.
Try me.
Give me your shoes and I'll let you come back.
Please?
Huh.
Okay?
No, I think we're finished.
Now you're just an out-of-work actor without pride or shoes.
Aw You know, Nora, you've put me through a lot tonight, and we may never see each other again, but at least I have one thing to say If you don't give me my shoes back I'm going to bust your lamp.
Here.
Here, take 'em.
My shoes are not for sale.
Yeah, Bob, I'm sorry it didn't work out with your manager.
Well, listen, we'll talk about it more when I get back tomorrow.
Yeah, of course I'm coming back.
Well, a man can only ski and relax and party and loaf for just so long before it gets old and boring.
Unfortunately, I ran out of money before I found out just how long.
Bob, I have to say good-bye.
The maid just came in.
Yeah, bye.
She kicked you out, huh, Wheeler?
Boy, did she ever.
Dropped me like a hot potato.
You're not going to do that part on Broadway?
I'm lucky if I ever get a job again.
I don't know.
It's the real pits.
I'll tell you that much.
Women.
Well, Bob Yeah, Lou?
There's only one thing I can say.
What?
Wheeler, cab 544!
Rappaport, 721
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
All right, where's the mechanic on duty?
I'm going to kill him.
What are you talking about?
I don't want to talk-- I got to hit.
Hey, hey, hey.
Tony, Tony, Tony, take it easy, take it easy.
Nobody's going to hit anybody.
Now just sit down and tell us about it calmly.
All right, Alex.
Yeah.
What is it?
I'm still shaking.
I'm driving down Fifth Avenue just before Saint Patrick's Cathedral.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm coming to a red light, I go to put my foot on the brake, my foot goes straight through to the floorboard.
Oh, no.
My, God.
Oh.
So I make it through the first intersection okay, right, but I can't stop this cab.
Here I am doing straight down a road, completely out of control.
Man, it's true what they say-- your life flashes in front of you.
You know, I lost a lot of fights.
So what'd you do?
So I did the first thing that came to mind.
I stopped myself by driving into a lamppost.
Tony, why didn't pull on the emergency brake?
It's for parking, Alex.
And emergencies, hence the name, emer You know, there's a logic to that.
Yeah.
You know something?
This is not an isolated incident.
Almost every night somebody has some kind of serious accident with a cab from this garage.
Hey, I don't care.
All I know is because of some dumb mechanic, I almost bought it.
Now, now, now, Tony, don't get don't be so quick to blame the mechanics.
They can only work with what they've got, and some powers that be around here don't want to give them new cabs.
For a minute there I thought I forgot to close the old porthole.
You got something on your minds?
Yeah, you might say that, Louie.
You know, uh, the cabs, they've been falling apart lately, and Tony's brakes, they just went out on him.
I mean, every time we go out of here, our lives are in danger, and we think it's about time you do something about it.
That's right, Louie.
Now you better stop and listen.
This could easily turn into an ugly mob.
I thought most of these people were just about as ugly as they could get.
I knew I shouldn't have said that.
Louie, man, that's it.
All right, all right, all right.
Hear me out.
So what are you going to do?
All right, hear me out.
I can understand that you're upset about this, and I'm going to do something that I don't normally do, but I think the gravity of this situation calls for it.
Yeah, like, what?
I'm going to write out a report.
Aw, come on!
That never works!
Don't try to talk me out of it!
When the welfare of my drivers is at stake, no step is too drastic.
Jeff, give me the report sheet.
All right, now what's the date?
Hey, Louie, you're always writing those reports, and they don't get us anywhere.
You're right.
A report isn't enough.
Tell you what I'm going to do.
I am going to issue "drive defensively" stickers.
Hey, Louie.
You're not going in that cage, Louie.
You get in there, and you lock the door, and it's business as usual.
In fact, you're not going anywhere until you promise to do something about this thing.
That's right, Louie.
That's right.
Okay.
Go blow-dry your face.
What are you doin?
Hyah!
Open up or I'll break it in, Louie.
Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin.
Break it down!
Break it down!
Get in there!
Where'd he go?
There's a secret passage.
Where is he?
!
There he is!
Go get him!
Hah-hah!
Hah-hah!
All right.
You forced me to give up one of my secrets, but I got others, and I'm not going to reveal them unless, of course, Nardo wants to beat them out of me.
Okay, that's it.
I think we should walk.
No, no, come on!
Guys!
To walk out is absolutely nuts.
Hey, hang on, guys.
I mean, come on.
We have some recourse here.
What recourse?
Let's talk about this.
The first thing I think we ought to do is we get our shop steward to issue a complaint with the union.
All right, who's the shop steward?
Uh, isn't it Stubby Detmuller?
No, no, no, he retired.
It was Detmuller, it was Detwyler.
No, Detwyler's the guy from the day shaft, he got thrown in the can for beating his wife.
I thought his name was Jim Petty or something.
No, Jim Petty is the backup goalie for the Rangers.
Just what I was afraid of-- they're getting organized.
Well, one thing's obvious-- we got to elect a new shop steward.
Okay, let's do it.
Come on!
All right, who we gonna get?
Come on.
Think, think.
Hey, uh, wait a minute.
Who's that tall, red-headed guy, comes in on weekends?
His name's Jack something or other.
Why?
You want to nominate him?
No, I just couldn't think of his name.
Jim, we're trying to find a shop steward.
So I nominate me.
You?
Yeah, man, I'm the guy who almost got killed today.
I deserve to see this through.
I'm mad and I want it.
And I second it!
I mean, if he's so mad, he might be able to get something done, right?
All those in favor of nominating Tony for the shop steward say, "aye".
Aye!
Congratulations.
You're our guy.
Stand back and watch my dust.
: Tony Tony Louie, me and you are going to talk, and I mean right now.
So you're the new shop steward, huh, Banta?
You've got it.
Congratulations.
Thanks, Louie.
Now, hey, but I mean business here.
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
Just step right into my cage, and we'll talk about it.
You want me to come into your cage?
Why, certainly.
You're the new shop steward.
I'm not going to let you stand out there on the floor with the rabble.
Come on in here and have a seat.
Right foot, left foot, right foot Sit down.
Sit down, Tony.
Okay, Lou, we are sick and tired of coming in here every day All right, all right, Tony, Tony, okay.
Now before you get started here-- and I do want to hear everything you got to say-- I just want to let you know that I was pulling for you during this election.
I mean, it's high time that your talents were recognized around here.
Oh, gee.
Thanks, Louie.
And I think that you're going to fit right in down at the Tide Pool.
Yeah, well, that's all well and good, Louie, but Tide Pool?
What's a Tide Pool?
That's that restaurant around the corner that us executives frequent after hours.
And now that you're the shop steward, I'm sure you're going to want to spend time down there yourself.
Well, I I don't know.
Oh Oh, you're going to love this place.
They got fishnets and blowfish hanging from the ceiling and all the waitresses wear leis, in keeping with the Polynesian cuisine.
And they got an exotic drink down there that will knock you right off your keester.
Hey, Louie, that sounds great but Hey.
I saw Jersey Joe Walcott in there the other night.
Really?
Yeah.
This is a classy joint.
Listen, after the shift is over, you come on down there, and I'll introduce you around to the gang.
Should I dress or anything, Lou?
Sure, well, a sport coat would be nice, huh?
How about around seven-ish?
Oh, and I'm buying.
Boy, that sounds great.
I really want you to try this drink.
It's called the monsoon.
It's days before your sky is clear.
I blew it, huh?
Big.
Well, I'm new at this.
I figured I'd get him down to Tide Pool, fill him full with monsoons and Tony, please don't take this personally, but if we're going to get anything done, we need a recall.
Well, that's just your opinion, man.
I'd like to hear what everybody else says.
Recall!
Well, look at it this way, Tony, you you brought us all together on one issue.
Okay, nominations are reopened.
I nominate Tony.
Jim!
Why would you want to nominate Tony?
!
There's no substitute for experience.
Oh!
You know, I-I think this job-steward, report-to-the-union stuff is a lot of crap.
I mean, it never accomplishes anything.
We've been trying it for years, and nothing's ever been done.
But what choice do we have?
The choice we have is walking out of here until these cabs are fixed!
Let's go!
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it!
Now listen.
A wildcat strike is absolutely nuts.
All we're doing is we're giving them the chance to fire us.
Now, I say that there are other channels we can go through to get what we want without losing anything.
Well, now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
She's making sense.
She's making sense.
Go ahead.
Yeah, okay.
I vote Elaine shop steward!
No, no.
Elaine, you have to do this.
Yeah, man, somebody's got to help us with this.
You'd be my choice.
Okay, I'll give it a shot.
All right, but Whoa, whoa.
But I'm not going to soil myself talking to Louie.
He's just Mackenzie's lackey, right?
Right.
So I'm going up to talk to the big man himself.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
: Elaine Elaine Elaine Elaine  So Nardo's your new shop steward, huh?
Wise choice.
What do you mean ?
I know how Mackenzie handles people.
Boy, Elaine's right up there, nose-to-nose with the boss, and our careers are hanging in the balance.
The suspense is unbearable, isn't it?
Sure is, Jim.
Well, see you tomorrow.
Take it easy, Jim.
Hey, here she is!
How'd you do?
Hey, Elaine, that was, like, really quick.
Uh, what happened?
Well, Mackenzie said that the profit margin is so low already that there's nothing he can do about it.
But I told him that we don't want to risk our lives in these cabs anymore.
So he said that, uh, "No one told you to take this job anyway".
Wh-What did you say then?
I said what any good New York cab driver would say under those circumstances.
I also said that we're on strike.
Shut it down!
Shut it down!
: Shut it down!
Shut it down!
Oh, no, no, no!
Oh, no, not a strike!
Oh, fie!
This really puts me in a bad position.
Now, where am I going to find people capable enough to drive cabs?
Yeah, where, Lou?
Come on.
Daily News!
Daily News!
Hey, kid!
You want to make some big bucks?
Take out Cab 132.
Come on.
Get out of the news field, get into the people-mover field.
You'll make some big bucks, kid.
And remember-- the big pedal's the brake.
All right, attention, substitute drivers.
We got a lot of cabs to get out here.
Hotchkiss.
Okay, Mr. Hotchkiss, now, watch out for any drunks out there.
Right?
Go on out there.
Uh, Ferguson?
Eight sixty-six.
Ferguson!
Somebody get Ferguson started there.
Okay, Mr. Ferguson, now, don't go rushing around here.
All right, here you go.
Life's too short to rush around there.
Go out there and knock them dead.
Uh, Scooter?
There you go.
626.
Go out there and buck, buck, buck, buck, buck.
Whitey?
There you go.
Get out there and make some money.
Stretch?
On your way.
My biggest booker here.
Okay, kid, now, you get out there and, remember, red means "stop," green means "go".
I love you mugs.
Ooh, it's cold.
What are you doing in here, Wheeler?
It's my turn to get coffee.
Huh-huh.
Pretty cold out there on the picket line, ain't it?
Oh, it-it's not so bad.
Louie, the coffee machine's not working.
It's just not working for non-employees.
Yeah, well, this non-employee wants his quarter back.
Put it in with your demands, Wheeler.
Hey, Bob?
What?
Don't you want your message?
I got a message?
Well, ordinarily I wouldn't take messages for a guy on strike, but this seemed like a real important one.
Well, what is it?
Well, your agent called and said you got a big shot at a movie, and the producers are going to meet you at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.
Oh, wow!
Oh, wow!
What time do I meet them?
Yesterday?
Well, I would've given it to you yesterday, but then I would have had to cross the picket line.
You know how I feel about the sanctity of picket lines.
You know, you only do this to me, Louie, to try and make me break down, but you're not going to get the satisfaction.
All you're going to get out of me is   Great news, Bobby.
What?
It better be great news.
Oh, the union has agreed to hold a hearing on our grievances.
Yeah, they're gonna subpoena Mackenzie  and Louie.
Isn't that great?
It ain't going to do you any good.
Oh, yes, it is, Louie.
Your back is against the wall.
We've got evidence that is overwhelming.
I'm used to this, Nardo.
I am prepared for this Mickey Mouse hearing.
Prepared?
Prepared, how?
While you lame-os are out there playing in the snow, I'm in here, doing a little plastic surgery on the books.
According to these records, the Sunshine Cab Company spends as much, if not more, money on maintenance and repairs than any other cab company in the city.
Once they get a look at these books, it will give us time to do a little repairs on the cabs so they pass inspection.
You see, you guys are dealing with pros here.
Hey, Louie, nobody's going to be gullible enough to believe your story.
Oh, no?
Hey, Iggy.
Yo.
The Sunshine Cab Company spends more on maintenance than any other company in the city.
Our strike worked.
All power to the people!
Well, we'll see, Louie.
We'll just see who they believe.
Come on, guys, let's get back to the line.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Farewell, workers of the world.
What are you hanging around for, Rieger?
A little scab city?
That's quite a little trick you're trying to pull with the books, Louie.
Yeah, I got a few touches in here that I'm proud of.
One of them is the Safety First picnic.
Boy, did we eat a lot of hot dogs at that picnic, but it was for a good cause.
You really feel good about this, don't you?
Yeah.
I just hope He forgives you.
Mackenzie?
He's ready to erect a statue to me.
You kidding?
No, no, no, I don't mean Mackenzie.
You know, when you walk into that hearing room, you're going to be under oath.
Sure, sure.
You know what that means?
Yeah.
It means they got to believe you.
I love this country.
No, Lou, it means that you'll be swearing to God to tell the truth, and then you'll lie.
Well, every great businessman has had to do that.
Besides, he understands what's going on.
He's a man of the world.
Well, okay.
It's okay with me if the idea of eternal damnation doesn't bother you.
You had to bring eternal damnation into it?
Eternal damnation-- you're giving me that?
I used to have a nun in my parochial school-- Sister Porchnik.
She used to give pop quizzes on eternal damnation.
You know, Louie, someday, some driver is going to go out of this garage in one of these cabs and he's going to get hurt, Lou.
He may even be killed, and you'll be responsible.
Not me.
You.
Not me.
You.
It ain't me.
You.
It ain't me.
It's Mackenzie.
He's the monster in here.
He's responsible for everything that goes on down here.
Then Mackenzie will be responsible for sending you to eternal damnation.
What am I going to do?
Well, if I were you, Lou, I'd start negotiating with our shop steward.
All right.
All right, send her in here.
It will be a pleasure.
You know what I hate about you, Rieger?
What's that?
You're always giving me that holier-than-thou attitude.
Well, I'm sorry, Lou.
It's just that thou art so easy to be holier than.
You wanted to see me?
Nardo, you know that I have the authority to end this strike any way and as I see fit.
I know that.
Okay, let's talk turkey here.
Are you serious about this?
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't think this strike should go on another day.
It's-it's hard on a lot of people.
All right, Louie, let's talk.
Okay.
All right, you sit down and tell me specifically what your demands are.
Okay.
We want you to retire all cabs that have been in service for over five years.
We want new brakes on the cabs.
We want you to increase the maintenance budget by at least ten percent, and we want at least one new mechanic on each shift.
All right, it's yours, Nardo.
It is?
Yeah.
You're going to give us what we want?
All right.
Great.
All right.
Now, all you have to do is honor a few simple demands of my own.
Like what?
Nothing bad.
Nothing bad.
You and me, for four days in a mountain cabin, with no one but the furry creatures of the woods to hear our screams of ecstasy.
One weekend.
One date to save cabbies' lives.
You'd give in to all of our demands if I go on one date with you?
That's right, Elaine.
Okay, it's luncheon.
A lot of people around.
We meet at the restaurant.
We part at the restaurant.
I get to bring a friend, and we sit at separate tables.
Fine.
Fine.
Let me-let me just alter that just a tiny bit.
It's at night.
It's dinner.
I pick you up.
I take you home.
It's just the two of us, and at some time during the evening, within the hearing of at least two other people, you must call me "Stallion".
And none of this-- none of this-- is negotiable.
Except "Stallion".
Especially "Stallion".
Louie, isn't there any other way we can settle this?
Yeah, the only alternative you have is to go into that hearing with me and my books, and I make mincemeat out of your case.
Do you promise me that no one will ever know about this?
Are you suggesting we keep our little tête-à-tête a secret from the eyes of a prying world?
No.
I'm suggesting that if you let anyone know that I've debased myself, I'll kill us both.
Does that mean you'll do it?
Yeah, I'll do it.
Oh, but, Louie, do you know what you're doing?
Do you realize?
You are using my concern for my fellow workers and friends to blackmail me.
You're taking advantage of something that's decent in me to satisfy some indecent needs of your own.
How does that make you feel?
Horny as all get out.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Last week on Taxi: Yeah, you might say that, Louie.
You know, the cabs, they been falling apart lately, and Tony's brakes-- they just went out on him.
I mean, every time we go out of here, our lives are in danger, and we think it's about time you do something about it.
Go blow-dry your face.
What are you?
Hey!
Hey!
Nardo's your new shop steward, huh?
Wise choice.
And I also said that we're on strike.
: Shut it down!
Shut it down!
Shut it down!
Shut it down!
One date to save cabbies' lives.
You'd give in to all of our demands if I go on one date with you?
You're taking advantage of something that's really decent in me to satisfy some indecent needs of your own.
How does that make you feel?
Horny as all get-out.
Well, welcome back, boys.
Don't get your hopes up, Louie.
These negotiations fall through between you and Elaine, we're going right back to the picket line.
Oh, they're not going to fall through, Wheeler.
Uh-uh.
By the way, what concessions did you make?
I'm not allowed to discuss that until after the negotiations.
Haven't you ever heard of the Taft-Hartley Act?
Hey, I used to see them on The Ed Sullivan Show.
Taft was the goofy one, right?
* That's why the lady * That's why the lady * That's why the lady * Is a tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp * You know, there's something weird here?
Yesterday, we were at a total impasse.
Today, everything's fine.
Hey, Alex, listen.
Elaine says everything's going fine, and we just have to trust her.
By the way, where is Elaine tonight?
She sad she was going to take the night off to rest.
Yeah.
You know, I think the pressure of being shop steward is finally getting to Elaine.
Why do you say that?
You know how, like, when she gets nervous, she starts biting fingernails?
Well, today, she started in on mine.
Hey, uh guys.
I need your opinion here on which is the best aftershave.
Oh, Louie.
Okeydoke.
The best-smelling.
Jeesh!
Rieger, I think your honker is most suited for this task.
I mean, uh I mean, you could smell these things from home.
Go on.
That one seems ideal.
My choice, too.
"Cruel Cavalier".
Won't be a mosquito near him all night.
Boy, Elaine sure turned out to be a good shop steward.
I'm hoping she turns out to be a great one.
There's something strange going on.
What did you say Elaine was doing tonight?
I told you.
She was going to take a night off-- get her mind off work.
Boy.
I don't know why they put so many pins in these new shirts.
Takes you an hour to get them off.
Hey, Lou, just what is it exactly you're getting prepared for tonight?
Oh, I got a little social engagement.
I don't even know why I'm putting this shirt on.
In a couple of hours, it's going to be ripped from my body.
Hey, if you guys will excuse me, I'm going to go over to Elaine's apartment and see how she's doing.
All right.
Okay.
Say hi.
Hey, Rieger.
You got a clean handkerchief on you?
Thanks.
Welcome back, Rieger.
Hey, Lou, you missed one of the pins.
Where?
Here.
Ow!
Nice to be back, Lou.
You're early, and she doesn't live here, and I have a headache!
Oh, God.
It's true.
Oh, Alex, what are you doing here?
Who were you expecting, Elaine?
My date.
Uh somebody you don't know.
Oh?
Tell me about him.
Oh, well, uh, his name is Joe, and he's a tall blond doctor, and he likes me very much, and won't hurt me.
Elaine, I know all about it.
I just left Louie at the garage in mid-drool.
I'm absolutely terrified about this whole thing.
I mean, it's the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
Elaine, you don't have to do this.
The duties of a shop steward do not entail mixing business with terror.
It's not part of a shop steward's duties to date Louie, you know.
Stubby Detmuller never did it.
There was that one time when he went out dancing with Louie on New Year's Eve.
I'm just trying to cheer you up.
I don't need cheering up.
I need tanking up.
Hide me!
Open the door and feast your eyes on a 150 pounds of hickey bait!
Alex, if I ask you real nice, will you take this bottle and beat me senseless?
Elaine, want me to talk to him-- tell him the whole thing's off?
No.
No, no.
It can't be off.
Oh Oh, I got to go through with this.
I mean, it's the only way we're going to settle the strike.
Would you watch him while I get ready?
Please open the door!
You don't know how long I've waited to feast my eyes on your loveliness.
What are you doing here, Rieger?
Elaine was called away.
I'm the deputy shop steward, and I'm taking over.
Drinky-poo?
Cut the jokes, Rieger.
Where's Nardo?
Ah!
My little girl is getting ready.
Well, this gives me an opportunity to get to know the man she's dating.
Sit down, young man.
And tell me what is it you do for a living?
What are you talking about, Rieger?
You know I'm a dispatcher.
Oh, a dispatcher.
I thought you were much more than that.
You seem like vermin.
You're getting in the way of my good time, Rieger.
Now, why don't you take a powder?
Ah, the impatience of youth.
Tell me, young man, are your intentions honorable here?
My intentions, Rieger, are to take a trip around the moon.
Now, where is she?
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Just take it easy.
Just take it easy.
I'll see if she's ready.
Elaine, your young snake is here.
What are you talking about, Rieger?
Nardo is going to have the time of her life tonight.
I got this whole evening programmed.
There's not a man, woman, or child that we're going to bump into tonight who isn't on my payroll.
I been out all morning greasing palms.
I'll bet.
Come on out, my little vision!
What the hell is this?
Now, now.
The little lady's wise.
There's a lot of flu going around these days.
You know how easy it is to pick up a little bug.
I found out.
Nardo, you look like Nanook of the North.
There was nothing in our agreement about how I had to dress.
Well, it's getting late.
I've got to go.
I'll leave you two kids to your fun.
Uh, Louie, don't you think it would be nice if Alex came with us?
Now, now, now, Elaine, come on, you gave your word.
You got to go through with this.
You got to go through with it.
Elaine, please.
Elaine.
Now listen, Louie.
Incidentally, all kidding aside, if you try anything with Elaine and I'll kill you.
It will take the coroner a week to pry the grin off my face.
Besides, you'll have to catch me.
I'll catch you.
I'll just send the hounds out after the scent of "Cruel Cavalier".
Whoo!
Now don't be afraid, my little one.
Are you ready to take your magic carpet ride with me?
One last request?
Could I call my children at the baby-sitter's?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Call the tots.
Tell them hi from Uncle Lou.
Hi, Mrs. Williams.
Yes, I'd like to speak to my children, please, uh, both of them, so could you put their little ears to the receiver?
Hi, babies.
I want you to remember that no matter what happens no matter what you hear about tonight I want you to always remember your mother the way she was the last time you saw her-- young and fresh and happy.
And I love you very much.
Okay.
: Okay, good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Nardo, I don't think you're going into this with the right attitude.
Let's just get this over with.
Allow me.
The ice is broken.
Okay, come on.
Sit right down there.
May I get you one of our exotic cocktails?
Oh, yes, Fritz.
I'd like two monsoons, please.
Yes.
Very good, Mr. De Palma.
You're going to love this drink.
I kind of thought, Nardo, that we'd have a little trouble with the conversation department, so I took the liberty to write up some notes here.
I mean, you know, it's things that you would say to me and my answers back to you.
Here's your copy.
You've written our entire conversation?
Well, not the whole thing, but just to get us rolling here.
You have the first line.
"I guess you know I have two children".
"Ah, children.
"Reminds me of the old phrase: "'Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king.
'" That's interesting.
Read.
"That's interesting".
"It must be hard, raising two kids and holding down two jobs".
"Well, I don't complain".
"Should we order dinner now"?
"No, I think we should order another drink.
I'm really enjoying our conversation".
Ah.
Here you go.
There you go, sir.
Thank you, Edmundo.
Oh!
Ooh!
Oh, well, maybe we better skip down there because my timing's a little off here.
That's not my line.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's your line right there.
"You have beautiful eyes".
"Thank you".
"Now, let's tear up this piece of paper and dance, stallion".
I'm not going to dance, Louie.
Nardo, it's not a date unless you dance with me.
You want to call the whole thing off?
Do you even know how to dance?
I mean, I like dancing.
I don't want to get out there and embarrass myself.
Are you kidding?
I do a great tango.
Tango at the Tide Pool?
Yeah.
I spent all morning taking lessons from a gay Spanish guy.
Louie, look at that band.
They don't even look like they'd know a tango.
Play, savages!
Kick!
Kick!
Kick!
And in and out and out and up, and slide, and Come on, Fritz!
Get 'em up!
So the guy says the guy says to the farmer "Just give me what the rooster gets".
Oh, well.
Oh, well, home again, home again jiggedy-jog.
Home?
Is it over?
Well, Elaine, wasn't that Tide Pool everything I told you it was going to be?
I mean, I'll bet you never been to a place where the waiter prepares your food at the table.
Pork chops?
Aw, boy.
You know something?
I never knew that you were such a drinker.
I mean, you put away six monsoons, and that's gotta be a Tide Pool record.
You don't even look the least bit sloshed.
And that's not even counting the three drinks I had before you arrived.
You had three drinks before I got here?
To wash down the Valium.
Geez.
I thought something like that would kill a person.
So did I. Good night, Louie.
What are you?
!
Whoa!
What do you mean-- good night?
Evening's young!
Come on, Nardo.
We got leftover garlic bread and shrimp puffs.
Come on!
I thought maybe you'd invite me in for a little midnight snack.
Good night, Louie.
The deal's over.
Deal?
You're still talking deal?
Come on, Nardo.
That deal was made when we were rational people, not pagans.
Aw, don't blow that thing again.
Just don't come near me.
Come on, Louie, it's late.
I just want to go in and shower and burn my clothes.
Wait, wait.
Hold on, here, Nardo.
I had just about enough of this.
You know, I shelled out some good money on you tonight.
The least you could have done was strip down to your dress.
I know you're in there somewhere.
Louie, please, it's been a long day for both of us.
Now, come on, let's just say good night.
Okay.
Oh, okay, you're right.
Okay, I'm going to go.
But you know something, Elaine?
I mean, if you'd have just just relaxed a little bit tonight, you might have had a good time.
But, no, no, you won't allow yourself to have fun with me.
I was looking forward to it all day.
I mean, I get dressed up real swell.
Take a beautiful woman out on the town I guess I'm just not as sophisticated as you.
No "Wait, Louie"?
Okay, so maybe I'm I'm a little rough around the edges, all right?
All I wanted was to have one classy evening in my life but most of all, I wanted you to have a good time, maybe change your opinion of me.
Nothing.
If it will make you feel any better, Elaine, I didn't have any fun either.
And if you think that it's impossible to hurt my feelings, well, you're wrong.
Just a second, Louie.
If it will make you feel any better the evening wasn't totally rotten.
Actually, uh I almost enjoyed the dancing.
You know?
Especially when everybody got around in a big circle you know, and started clapping.
Enthusiasm like that doesn't come cheap.
Ha-ha!
Ah!
Oh!
Oh, Nardo.
Ah, Louie.
Thank you, Louie.
Yeah?
Yeah.
It was okay.
You really mean that?
Yeah, I do.
I knew it.
I knew you were starting to have fun.
Oh, a little bit.
Just a little?
A little bit.
Aw, Nardo.
You know what, Nardo?
You know what would round this evening out?
A good night kiss.
Oh, come on.
All right, that's it.
Now, come on, come on!
Oh, come on, come on!
Just a little kiss, come on.
It would mean a lot to me.
Come on.
All right, come on, just a little peck on my!
Peck.
Come on!
Come on, just show me that, like, you know, this evening wasn't a total disaster, you don't think any less of me.
All right, all right.
Here.
There.
I'll put the shrimp puffs down.
Okay, I put the garlic bread there, all right?
Okay?
All right.
I'll stand over here.
I'll put my hands at my sides.
I won't move.
And you can kiss me.
Go ahead.
I'll close my eyes.
Come on.
Come on.
Well Thanks.
I really had a good time.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hey, uh, you guys mind if I sit with you?
You know the rules, Louie.
You're not allowed to drink with us.
Yeah.
I got a little problem I'd like to talk over, but if that's the way you feel.
Hey, Louie, you got a problem, Lou?
Come on.
That's all right.
You don't want to hear it.
Come on, Louie, tell us about your problem, come on.
Come on, Lou.
Here you go.
Come on, big All right.
I want to hear it.
My problem is I'm bored.
Oh, you are, huh?
Yeah.
I'm so bored, I got nothing better to do than to sit here and talk with you losers.
That's a dirty shame, Louie.
Hey, Louie, Mr. Mackenzie just called.
He said you got to get back to the garage right away.
Sheesh!
I've been gone two minutes, and Mackenzie panics.
He couldn't run that company without me.
Did he say what the problem was?
Yeah, he wants you to get him some cigarettes.
Cabs without brakes to anybody who laughs.
I mean it, Banta!
One snicker and you'll get a cab you can't stop for a month.
Tony, Tony, just think about something sad, something awful.
Yeah, like how poor Louie has to pick up cigarettes for the boss, like some kind of flunky.
That did it, Banta.
You better pray for green lights.
It was worth it.
Rieger.
Hi, Louie.
Hey, Alex.
How you doing?
Hey.
Hi.
Another glass, Tommy.
Coming up!
So, uh how was your latest ski weekend?
Wonderful.
Is that all?
I'm sorry, guys, but I don't want to talk about it.
Why not?
Oh!
Because I had an experience that, um well, it's very difficult to put it into words, and, uh I just I'm afraid that if I talk about it, it's going to make it seem commonplace and, well, it wasn't commonplace.
I mean, it was very important to me.
I mean, it was profound.
It's changed me in a way that I'll never be able to think or feel or be the same way again.
Did you meet any chicks?
Alex, you know you're going to tell us about it eventually.
And you know that we're all waiting to hear you tell us.
Oh, please, please And you know that none of us are going to talk about anything else until you do tell us, so Okay.
I met a girl.
Right.
Her name was Linda.
She got the bluest eyes I've ever seen.
Anyway, we were skiing together on Saturday, and um, she said, "Don't you think that ski jumping is the biggest thrill in this life"?
And I said, "I don't know.
I always thought it was good for a couple of laughs".
And I mean, somehow or another she interpreted that to mean that I'd done it before, so she suggested that we go up and take a jump.
I was looking at her just like you're looking at me.
I mean, I-I didn't know what else to say, so I said, "Okay".
I mean No, I thought someone would come along or somebody or something would come along to stop us before we actually did it.
Well, anyway, we started climbing and climbing and climbing and climbing Alex, why didn't you just tell her that you've never done it before?
Did I mention that she had the bluest eyes I've ever seen?
Say no more.
Anyway, so we get to the top and we look down, and I'm telling you it was straight down.
I mean, just standing there and looking, I couldn't breathe.
You know, sometimes when you get so scared you can hear your heartbeat?
Yeah.
She heard my heartbeat.
The people down in the lodge were saying, "What's that noise up there"?
I'm telling you!
Maybe that would have been a good time to tell her that you've never done it before.
Well, yeah, I would've, but it's very difficult to talk and whimper at the same time, so So, did you go down it?
Well, uh she gave me a kiss good-bye, and she went down.
And I watched.
I mean, she made a beautiful jump, and I was up there by myself.
So, I, uh, I started to take off my skis so I can climb back down, you know?
But even that was a little scary to me, so then, well, I said, "Wait a minute.
What kind of a person am I"?
I sit in my cab all my life just driving around.
You know, I've never tried to push myself.
I mean, all my life I-I've taken the safe way.
You know, I've made the rational choice.
I said, "This one time I'm going to do the opposite".
You mean you jumped?
Well, you know, Tony, the difference between going and not going is really a very small amount.
I mean, all you have to do is shift your weight forward just the slightest bit-- I mean, less than you'd even think.
Certainly less than I thought.
So you decided to go?
Well, I don't know if I decided, but, uh Maybe it was me, maybe it was the breeze.
But I went!
I'm telling you, I went straight down!
I mean, the tears were streaming back from my eyes alongside my head.
The G-force was so great it was pulling my cheeks back.
I knew there was no force on heaven and Earth that was going to stop me now, as I went.
And then I was flying.
I was flying.
Ooh!
I'm telling you, I was flying.
I was so glad that I'd listened to Jim McKay all those years, because I knew just what to do, you know?
I mean, how to keep my chin out over the tips of my skis.
But that was going to be no small trick, because I was upside down, I couldn't find my chin.
And there I was Lake Placid, and I couldn't find my chin!
So how-how did you land?
You're not going to believe this.
I actually landed on my feet.
All right!
And then on my head, and then on my back and then on my feet.
By the time I came to a complete halt, I was the biggest snowball in the history of Lake Placid.
And then, when I thawed out, I found myself staring into the bluest eyes I've ever seen.
And she said, "Boy, you got guts".
Oh.
Wow.
That's some Saturday.
Don't you understand?
I actually did it.
I mean, that was the biggest thrill of my life.
Well ever since that Saturday on that ski jump, I, uh my food has tasted a little better, the air has smelled a little fresher, the sky seems a little bluer, and this life has seemed just a little bit nicer.
So, I've decided the most important thing in a man's life is to face his fears.
Tommy?
Yo.
Set 'em up and put it on the snowball.
You know, Alex, it's-it's like that with acting, too.
It's like the biggest thrill is when, is when the role is so challenging or the performance so important that there's a chance I could blow it and be humiliated.
Right.
Hey, maybe that's why boxing's so thrilling.
Every time I go in the ring, I got a shot at being humiliated.
And of being badly injured.
Yeah, sounds like you got the best of both worlds.
I guess that's why it's so exciting.
I mean, let me tell you, every time you step in that ring, you're testing yourself.
Say that again, Tony.
What did I say?
Hey, Tony?
I want to learn how to box.
Oh, come on, Alex.
What?
No, no, no, I-I mean it.
Would you teach me?
Sure.
How about tomorrow?
Tomorrow's fine.
Great!
Oh, I get what you're doing.
I mean, you didn't kill yourself enough on the slopes, so now you want to do it in the ring.
No, you don't understand.
You see, getting hit has been one of my fears.
Yeah, I know.
And I want to confront it.
Listen to how you're talking.
I mean, what's going on with you?
I don't know!
But ever since that jump on Saturday, I understand what Hemingway was talking about.
Every man has fears, but those who face their fears with dignity have courage, as well.
For instance, that piano.
You're going to ski off that piano?
No, you see, I, uh well, I-I know how to play the piano a little bit, you see, but I've always been afraid of calling attention to myself, you know?
Alex, what are you doing?
I don't know.
I I I'll do a little, uh "Being Alive".
: I don't know.
Hmm  * Somebody hold me too close * Somebody hurt me too deep * Somebody sit in my chair * * And ruin my sleep * And make me aware * Of being alive  * Being alive * Somebody need me too much * Somebody know me too well * Somebody pull me up short * * And put me through hell * And give me support * For being alive * Being alive * Being alive Being alive.
Well, thank you!
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Are there any requests?
"Being Alive".
I think I know that one.
* Somebody need me too much * Somebody know me too well * That's good, Alex.
Ooh, yeah, yeah.
Stick that jab.
That's it, stick it, yeah.
Oh, be careful.
All right.
Ooh, good shot!
Ooh, eh, that hurt.
Ooh, hey, yeah, uh.
Alex, Alex, Alex?
Yeah.
Don't drop your hands.
I did that in a college fight-- it killed me.
Gotcha.
Okay.
Hey, yeah, that's good.
Yeah, shoot it.
Yeah, that's it.
Shoot it, yeah.
Whoo, whoo, wait.
Alex, Alex, Alex?
What?
You're telegraphing your punches.
You can't do that, you see?
See, I did that with Ellison-- I was out for a week.
Okay?
Okay, here we go.
Okay, oh, good eye Oh, Alex, Alex, Alex, Alex You can't take your eyes off your opponent.
I did that with Sinacori-- ended up in the second row.
No substitute for experience.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, what Hey!
All right, all right, all right.
Okay, Alex, you're doing good.
Let's take a little break.
Okay.
Whoo!
How am I doing, Tony?
Be honest with me.
I'll tell you the truth, Alex.
You know, you got good boxing instincts, and you got great reflexes, too.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Hey, come on, let's just forget about this break.
Let's get back in the ring and spar.
I want to do some more sparring, some real sparring.
Oh, no, Alex, I don't think you're ready for that kind of sparring with a professional.
I'll right, I'll settle for an amateur.
Must be one in the gym who'd spar with me.
Oh, yeah, I guess you could try him.
He any good?
No, but he's safe.
No, Tony, I don't want safe.
The idea is to get in there with someone who isn't safe.
I mean, I don't want a pushover.
I want him.
He'll kill you.
Well, maybe there's somebody else.
No, man, no, I want him.
Is he an amateur?
Yeah, a good amateur.
Bring him on.
Alex, I'm telling you I can't let you do this, it's dangerous.
No, I just want to go one round with the guy.
Just one round.
I'll stay away from him.
Just one round.
Look, I just want the thrill of being in the ring with a guy who's looking to knock my head off and who could.
Alex, I understand that feeling, but this guy could break your jaw Tony, Tony, just one round.
I got to do this.
Hey, uh, Carl?
Yeah.
Want to box with my buddy?
Sure.
Carl, I'm talking one round, man, no more, and I'm gonna time it.
And take it easy on him, 'cause he's new at this.
Hey, hey, forget that "take it easy" stuff!
Now, wait a minute.
No, I'm going to go all out, and I suggest you do the same thing.
Okay.
No sense going crazy on me, though, you know.
Don't worry, I'll be all right.
You got any last tips?
Don't do this.
Don't worry.
I'll go easy on the guy.
All right.
Okay box.
Looking good, Al.
Hey, man, you want to box or not?
Uh-oh.
Alex?
Hmm?
Alex?
Wha, wha, what?
Alex?
What?
What happened?
You got knocked out.
I did?
Yeah, man, you took a mean-looking shot to the head, Al.
Would that have knocked out a good boxer?
It would have knocked out a rhinoceros.
All right, all right!
I got knocked out!
I took it, Tony, I took it, and I feel great!
Tommy, how about another one?
Oh, I think you've had enough, Jim.
Ahh, the morning's young.
Give me another one.
Okay.
Did a beer just go by?
Sure did.
You're right again, Tommy.
Hey, Jim.
Don't tell me you're going home?
Okay, if you hear about it, you didn't hear it from me.
So anybody know what "Rieger Knievel" is doing today?
God only knows.
He's facing some fear or other.
This is getting ridiculous.
I mean, that man is a living beer commercial.
I mean, where's it going to end?
Hi, guys.
Oh, Alex, you having a normal day?
Yeah.
Oh, you mean, you haven't laughed in the face of death even once today?
I haven't even snickered.
And you're actually depressed about it?
Yeah.
You know, last week was one of the greatest in my life.
Now I'm running out of things to do.
Thrill Seekers?
Well, it just caught my eye at the newsstand.
Aw, they're out of the latest copy of Death Wish?
Rieger, there you are.
Hi, Louie.
Been looking all over for you.
What do you?
Banta, move over.
Move it, move it, move it.
All right.
All right.
All right, man!
I got some papers I want you to sign here.
What are those?
I want to insure your life.
What?
I don't believe him.
This guy's unbelievable.
Now, listen, listen.
We've been through a lot together, Rieger.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I just felt like I had to do this for you.
Mm-hmm.
I took out a $50,000 life insurance policy, and in the event that anything should happen to you-- God forbid a million times-- I get the money, 'cause I took out the policy.
Don't you have to go someplace to shed skin, Louie?
Now, now, Rieger, Rieger, I understand that these matters are very difficult to talk about.
But listen, you haven't heard the best part yet.
I made your daughter, Cathy co-beneficiary.
She gets half the money.
Louie, you are really the worst.
Okay.
Okay, I'll sign it.
Are you kidding, Alex?
No, I think something should go to her if anything should happen to me when I do this.
: You're going to wrestle a shark?
No, no, no, this page.
I'm going to jump out of an airplane.
Oh, my God.
Hot dog!
Sign right there.
I'm going to jump out of an airplane.
Are you nuts, Alex?
I can't believe There is nothing more terrifying to me in this life than jumping out of an airplane.
Who's going to go with me, huh?
All right, Alex, this is going too far.
All right, you had a good ski vacation, and you've been having a lot of fun lately, but th-this is crazy.
Oh, no, you don't understand.
Listen to this.
Just listen to this: "Skydiving is the single greatest thrill in this life.
"There is a point at which you stop falling and you start flying".
I heard it's wonderful wonderful!
Right here!
Don't you think it's a little odd that your beneficiary wants you to do this?
Come on, get out of here!
Who's going with me?
Who's going with me?
How-how-how much more time?
A couple of minutes.
Oh.
Okay, time to prepare for the jump.
I'm nervous.
It's it's okay, Alex.
I'm nervous, too, and I'm not even jumping, thank God.
Oh, I it just slipped out.
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's normal to be nervous first time out.
Sure it is, sure it is.
You got nothing to worry about.
Just what do you think his chances are?
Louie, sit down and shut up.
It's such a beautiful day for a jump.
Just do everything exactly as you did in ground school.
Everything's going to be fine.
Believe me, you're going to love it.
Just wish I were jumping today.
How come you're not?
Last time I jumped, I injured my spleen.
Soon as I'm able, though, I'll be jumping again.
It's that good, huh?
Oh, it's better than sex.
It's better than most sex.
Listen, uh, maybe we can, uh, get together and compare some notes and do some persuading, you know.
I take a lot of persuading.
Well, just give me some time, and  Hey, Bobby, will you cut that out?
Can't you wait till I'm gone?
Till I've jumped?
You're right All right, you ready, Mr. Rieger?
Huh?
Ready?
For what?
Oh oh, yeah I guess so.
Okay, Alex, we're all with you.
That's it Okay.
Oh.
my God.
We're almost over the jump area, so let's get set.
Get you hooked up.
Just hooking him up.
You know what just occurred to me, sitting here with the breeze blowing in my face and my adrenaline pumping me up to do what few men will ever attempt?
What's that, Alex?
I'm not going down there.
I'm not going down there.
I'm not going to go.
But Alex!
I'm not go Ah!
What about the single most greatest thrill in your life?
Oh, no, I don't want to go.
All right, okay, Alex?
Okay, Alex, you don't have to go if you don't want to-- you don't have to.
No?
Here, here, I'll-I'll handle this.
Alex?
What?
A man's got to do what a man's got to do.
Louie, Louie!
All right, all right, look, look, Rieger?
Yeah, what?
I'm not trying to force you into anything.
I just want you to know-- so that you don't get the wrong idea here-- this is very hard for me to say, but I just want you to know what kind of guy I am.
I got $50,000 riding on this, and I still hope you don't die.
I hope you're not waiting for applause, Louie.
If you're going, Mr. Rieger, it's got to be now.
Alex, Alex, you don't have to do this if you don't want to.
Nobody's going to think any less of you.
Nobody but me.
Geronimo-o-o o-o-oh Alex?
What?
You're still here.
I am?
I could swear I jumped.
My spirit jumped.
It's just my body that's left here.
Ah, what the hell?
I'm going to die!
I'm going to die.
I'm going to die!
I'm going to die ohh It opened.
The chute opened.
I'm not going to die.
I'm not going to die; I'm going to live.
I'm going to live.
* Oh, life is good * Life is wonderful And I'm going to throw up.
I'm going to I'm going to spend the single greatest thrill of my life throwing up.
No, hold it, hold it, I'm going to be okay.
It passed, it's going to be okay.
Oh, my God, look at this, it's incredible.
I feel like I feel like like * Being alive * Being alive * Being ali-i-ve  and you feel small, fragile but also strangely invincible, as if you're no longer a part of that miniature world below you, because you've just separated yourself from reality for the moment  by diving from that plane and plunging toward Earth in defiance of your own mortality.
I mean, it's all dreamlike.
Nothing real can touch you as you float in your reverie trying to understand what you're feeling, and at the same time, not wanting to understand it, because it's too magnificent to be within the grasp of detached logic and finite thoughts, which limit your glimpse of boundless, wondrous magnificence.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hey, guys, get your money out, I'm going to make you rich.
What's up, Tony?
I got a tip on a fight on the island.
We can't lose.
You know how I know?
He's fighting you?
Better than that.
Nothing's better than that.
Thank you.
I heard these two guys talking in the gym about this light heavyweight named Johnson, right?
Yeah?
Yeah?
He's got a broken right hand, but he's going to fight anyway 'cause he needs the money.
Ooh, that sounds good to me.
I'm in.
Me, too.
I'm in.
I'm in.
Hey, Latka, do you want to get in on this bet?
A bet?
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh, come on, guys.
What?
Yeah, What?
Do you have to get Latka involved in this?
Elaine, listen, we know you get a little irrational when it come to gambling, so No, it's not that.
It's just that, you know, Latka doesn't make much money and he has to work so hard, and he's sending money to people back home.
Besides, I bet he doesn't even know what he's betting on.
Sure he does.
That's right.
Okay, what are you betting on?
Uh the horse racing.
No.
Uh football.
Nope.
Badminton?
Latka Chin-punching.
Latka, it's boxing, and it's a sure thing.
There's no sure thing.
Hey, listen, Latka, it's your money and you can do what you want.
That's right, Latka.
What would you do, Alex?
Me?
Yeah.
What do you mean, if I was you?
Yeah.
I would tell Elaine, uh : Elaine, Elaine this fellow has a broken hand, and I could win many dollars, and that would make my family and me very happy.
Thank you very much.
You may laugh, but I know people who talk like that.
I'm in.
There we go.
All right.
Listen, I'll call the bet in, all right?
Thanks a lot, Alex.
Hey, come on Are you going to bet, too, boss?
I have one very firm rule in my life: I don't eat at the same table, bet on the same side, or climb on the same airplane as losers.
Be gone, Iggy.
Okey-doke.
Hey, Tony, thanks a lot for letting us in on that tip.
Hey, don't mention it, Alex.
Oh, it's a sweet one.
Hey, Tony?
Tony, the guy's name is Johnson, right?
That's right, that's our man and he's going down.
Yeah, well, the guy Johnson's fighting is named Johnson, too.
Wow.
What a coincidence.
I wonder how many Johnsons there could be?
At least two, and they're fighting each other tonight.
What do we do, Tone?
Oh, geez Just bet on one of them.
We got a 50-50 chance on a sure thing.
Listen, you just have a nice day, okay?
Yeah, thanks a lot.
You must all promise to keep me informed of your flight plans.
Elaine if you value our friendship, you will not put that smirk into words.
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.
I don't mean to make you feel any worse than you do.
It's just that I see you guys miss every day.
Every day you come in here with some sure thing and it never works out.
And every day at that gallery I see rich people getting richer.
I mean, they are always gambling, and it never misses.
Just once, I'd like to see somebody like us make some money.
Oh, me, too.
But how?
By making intelligent investments, you know, like in art for example.
Art?
You bet on painters?
Yeah, in a way.
See, I find paintings that I know are going to go up in value and then I get other people to invest in them and then they become rich.
Hey, wait a minute, Elaine.
If you could do it for other people, you could do it for us.
You could do it for yourself.
Oh, no, I don't think so.
Come on, Elaine, Elaine, We can pool our money and you can invest it in some art for us.
I'm in, and there'll be more tomorrow when I get my fight money.
Oh, please.
No, guys, I don't like to look at art that way.
See, I was just using art as an example.
Oh, no, but, Elaine, you have inside information.
I know I've got inside information, but, um, I love art, and I hate using it to make money.
Besides, how much could we raise?
As much as we need.
Come on, come on, let's do it.
Yeah, Yeah, come on, what do you say, huh?
No, No, No.
I promised myself I'd never do it.
No.
This could be the best thing that's ever happened for us.
No, guys, I mean, this is final.
That's it, forget it.
Boy.
I don't think you ever had any inside information.
I think you were just trying to impress us.
As a matter of fact, I know of a great investment right now.
You do?
Yes.
There's an artist named Max Duffin, and he's going to be so big.
I mean, next week at an auction we could get a painting for $2,000, and by the end of the year it'd be worth $5,000.
$5,000?
We could make a fortune if we kept doing that.
Yeah, well, maybe not a fortune but $100,000 apiece.
still be worth it.
Listen, Elaine, please, come on, okay?
Come on.
Yeah, come on, Elaine, don't deny us a Duffin.
No.
Elaine, Elaine, don't let this chance slip by.
Do you remember "If"?
"If"?
Yeah, "If" by Rudyard Kipling.
"If you could make one heap of all your winnings "and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, and lose "and start again at your beginnings "and never breathe a word about your loss" "If you can talk with crowds "and keep your virtue "or walk with kings-- nor lose the common touch.
"If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you.
"If all men count with you, but none too much.
"If you can fill the unforgiving minute "with sixty seconds' worth of minutes run "then yours is the earth "and everything that's in it and, which is more, you will be a man, my son"!
Where the hell did I learn that?
Okay, you got me.
We did?
Yeah, we'll do it.
We'll do it.
Okay, now, you're sure this guy's work is going to go up, right?
I'm positive.
Well, because there's this thing, you know, um, that I really don't want to talk about because it's terrible and sort of ghoulish.
Well, what is that?
Well well, okay.
It's kind of morbid, you know, but it's a reality of the art business.
See, um Max Duffin is an old man, and he's in very bad health.
And, well, uh, an artist's work always goes up in value after the artist dies.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I've known works to triple and quadruple in value the day after the artist passed away.
Oh, I'm feeling so creepy even talking about it.
Yeah, ooh, let's not talk about that, no.
How sick is he?
Louie, I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you don't have to give me the gruesome details.
Can he eat solid food?
Does he recognize visitors?
Is he on any machines?
I mean, is there a plug somebody might accidentally Whoop!
Trip over?
Hey, Louie, what do you care?
Well, suddenly, this investment interests me.
I mean, as I see it, buying one of the old geezer's paintings is like betting he's going to die.
We can't lose.
What do you mean "we"?
I want in.
Hey, forget it, Louie.
No way, Louie.
No, wait a minute, hold on.
You two dumb bozos can't decide for everybody.
All the dumb bozos have to have a say.
All right, let's be democratic about it.
All those in favor of keeping Louie out of this deal signify so by spitting on his shoes.
Now, wait, hold on, here.
You better think this over.
I mean, this is not penny-ante stuff here.
I mean, we're dealing with big stakes here, boys and girls.
You need somebody who's got a bankroll.
I got money.
Why don't we vote on it?
Maybe we should.
Oh, we don't need to vote No, I think we do.
Uh, Louie Would you mind giving us a little privacy so we can talk about this?
Why, certainly.
I'll just sit over here turn my back away and, uh, you know, you just pretend I'm not in the room, and I'll respect the confidentiality of your discussion.
I hate him.
Okay, look, maybe he's right.
Maybe we do need his money.
No.
Come on, we got enough amongst ourselves.
How much you said we needed, $2,000?
Yeah.
Okay.
How much are we all going to throw in?
A ballpark figure, Tony.
What do you think?
Oh, 200 bucks.
All right.
Bobby?
About the same.
Elaine?
Maybe $250?
Good.
Latka?
How much is that in American money?
Nothing.
Jim, Jim $18.
Is that all?
Hey, I can buy and sell Latka.
Okay, uh, so without you, Alex, we have about $700 and with you we have?
A desperate need for Louie.
I'm sorry.
I blew my whole bankroll on that skiing trip.
I'm sorry.
Okay, but no-- guys, this is our chance.
Come on, this one painting could do it for us.
Really.
Whatever we have to do we should do it.
Trust me on this.
I'm the practical one, remember?
Guess there's only one way to settle it.
Let's vote.
Okay, but look, let's make it unanimous-- unanimous.
Otherwise, he's not in, okay?
Jim.
All those in favor of keeping Louie in, raise your hands.
Raise it or lose it, Wheeler.
That a boy.
You know, I I've-I've heard that there's a thrill associated with coming in contact with great art, but I never realized how true it was until this very moment.
Bobby, these are just prints.
They're copies of original paintings.
They're almost worthless.
The actual paintings for auction are in the other room.
Oh.
Alex, just so you'll be informed, I want to explain what this paddle is for.
You see, you use it I know what it's for, Elaine.
I'm not a total dummy.
I know something about the world of culture.
Okay.
Hey, what's it for?
What do you mean, this paddle?
Yeah.
Well, it's for making your bid.
Well, it's for making your bid.
You hold it up to be You hold it up to be recognized by the auctioneer.
recognized by the auctioneer.
Does that explain it for you, Bob?
Oh, good, you gave Latka the day off.
Yeah, I told him that all he had to do is fix the problem in cab 643, he could come with us.
Oh, did you get it fixed?
Uh almost.
What's that?
Uh uh I don't know.
That's the problem.
Oh, no.
Jim I thought you were going to dress up.
Yeah, I loaned you a suit.
What happened?
I know, but it didn't fit me, except the tie.
As luck would have it, we've got the same tie size.
Yeah, that is lucky.
Guys, why don't we go in and get a good seat.
Oh, okay.
Whew.
Hey, Elaine better tell us what to do in there.
We never been to nothing like this.
Oh, Tony, don't worry about it, just relax.
I'm going to take care of the bidding, so, uh, you guys just try to maintain an air of dignity.
So Miss Nardo, which one is ours?
Oh.
This is worth Yes, and it's going up as we're talking about it.
Gee, you know, it's untitled.
For 2,000 bucks, you'd think they'd throw in a name.
You you know something?
I like it.
Me, too.
It is very pretty.
Yeah?
Well, enjoy it all you want now, because we're only holding onto this rag until the old geezer croaks, and then it's gone.
Well, on that inspiring note, I think we better take our seats.
Why don't we sit in the front where we can be heard?
But there's only one seat left in the front.
Not for long.
Way to go, Louie.
It's just what I expected-- they estimate our painting will sell for between $1,000 and $1,800.
We only have $2,000.
Louie, are you sure you can't go any further?
I told you, I got every penny I own sunk into this deal.
I thought you said you had a lot of money.
Yeah, but it's not in cash.
Most of my assets are tied up in investments.
I know I'm going to regret asking this: what sort of investments are your assets tied up in, Lou?
Well, right now all my money's in a nursing home in Jersey.
I mean, you know, nursing homes are a really good deal.
The only problem is the people that run this one spend too much money on upkeep, you know, and there's not enough profits to go around.
Why don't you straighten them out, Lou?
I tried.
I told them, "Those people don't eat three meals a day".
I mean, their memories are so bad they don't know whether they had three meals or a cracker.
I say let them sleep.
Louie?
What?
You're a slime, Louie.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to begin the auction.
All right, all right, let's settle down here and concentrate.
Our first item today will be a painting by Wallace Leidegger entitled Nude at Daybreak.
All right!
My God, I know her!
She's dyed her hair, but that's her.
Jim, Jim, sit down.
And may we have $1,800 to start, please?
$1,800.
Thank you-- $1,800 is bid.
Now $2,000.
Hey, Elaine, our painting's next.
Now, as I see it, it's in our best interest that we make everybody else think it's worthless, right?
Louie, please.
Our next painting is another work by Max Duffin.
Yike!
Whew!
How did that get in here?
Yuck!
Ugh!
This painting is untitled.
I got one for it.
How about "Garbage"?
What is wrong with you?
Okay, listen, everybody, this is it.
Now, pay attention.
May we have $1,000 to start this painting, please?

Hey, listen, we need more money!
Yeah.
Louie, don't you have any more?
I told you it's all I got!
Somebody's got to have some money, man.
I can't believe we're going to lose this painting for $100.
$2,200.
For $200.
$2,200 Oh, great, now all we need is $400.
Now may we hear 25?
May we see 25?

Ladies and gentlemen, I have some bad news for you.
I have just been handed a note that Max Duffin, the artist of the last two paintings that we sold, died this morning at his home in New Mexico.
Oh, no!
That's not fair!
That's not God, why, God?
Well this should be a lesson to me.
I thought maybe, maybe just this once, maybe once, I could have some dealings with losers and not get burned.
It can't be done.
It just cannot be done.
But, you know, if you guys were at Normandy, we'd all be eating strudel right now.
Oh, come on, Louie, knock it off.
We feel as bad as you do.
No, you don't.
Now you don't.
Defeat and humiliation are a way of life for you.
It's bad for my system.
Elaine, what happened?
How come everything was more than we could afford?
It just goes to prove one thing: You got to have money to make money.
I must admit I feel pretty silly getting all dressed up for nothing.
Come on.
Come on, let's go to Mario's, have a beer.
Okay, yeah.
You guys go on ahead.
I'm going to stay here and look around for a while.
Look around at what?
I came here to buy a piece of art.
I feel like buying a piece of art.
I mean, uh, I'm going to buy one of these things.
They are for sale, aren't they?
Mm-hmm.
So, they may not be original.
I mean, I may not make any money from it.
I'm not, am I?
So what?
I'm going to buy something I like.
Well actually, I there is some stuff here I kind of like, too.
Yeah, maybe I'll buy something, too.
I got some wall space to cover up.
Well, yeah, let's look around.
And, you know, if you don't see anything you like here, I know a lot of places.
Okay.
Yeah.
Nardo I mean, what's the big deal here?
I mean, why buy any of this junk if it's worthless?
Louie, I think it has a value that you can't understand.
Hold on, here.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you just called me a slob.
I mean, I'll show you what kind of slob I am.
Hey, there, cookie.
I want one of your classiest things here-- something by Vincent Van Patten, or one of those guys.
Hey, Elaine?
This is a reproduction, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.
Is it good?
Do you like it?
Yeah, I like it a lot.
Then that's good.
Then I'm going to buy it.
Okay.
Come on with me.
Night, Mr. Walters.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Hey, guys.
You're never gonna believe who I had in my cab last night.
Who?
Guess.
We give up.
Who?
What's-his-name.
Hey, it is what's-his-name.
That's Herve Villechaize.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know, the little guy from Fantasy Island.
He left these pictures in my cab last night.
Well, your first celebrity fare.
Congratulations.
Well, it's not my first, Alex.
You see, uh, once I had a guy who went to school with Leonard Nimoy.
Hey!
Is that that guy-- the guy from Fantasy Island?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, I-I do an impression of him.
Cracks Ma up every time.
You want to hear it?
No.
No.
No.
Okay, it goes like this here.
: Hey, boss.
Hello, boss.
How are you, boss?
Here come the plane, boss.
What you want, boss?
You like it?
Not bad, but could you do the guy who went to school with Leonard Nimoy?
Envy is an ugly emotion, Rieger.
Bye-bye, boss.
See you.
Hey, Nardo.
How are you?
Hey, Banta.
How you doing?
Hey, Tony!
You know, he left a negative in here.
He's probably going to need this stuff.
Oh, yeah?
I better call him.
I left him off at the Plaza.
Ooh, Tony, could you get his autograph for my kids?
I'll see what I can do.
Uh, what is going on here?
Oh, Latka, Tony had this big TV star in his cab last night.
Yeah, from Fantasy Island-- look.
They probably don't get Fantasy Island in Latka's country.
They usually get old rerun our old shows, you know.
What's your most popular TV show in your country, Latka?
Oh, I would say, The Drofnikis.
What's that?
Oh "Hey, Ralphie boy-- how you doing?
"Oh, Alice, one of these days, pow!
Right, right, right in right into the moon".
Oh, yeah, yeah-- The Honeymooners.
And also, you know, we also enjoy I Nik-nik Lucy.
Yeah, well, we enjoy that one, too, Latka.
He wasn't there, but I left our number.
He's going to call later.
So what is this, uh, Fantasy Island?
Well, actually, Latka, there really isn't a fantasy island.
Boy, I wish there was a place like that.
Imagine, someplace you could go and live out all your fantasies.
You got fantasies you want to live out, Tony?
Oh, sure.
Like what?
I ain't gonna talk about 'em.
They're private.
I know what it is.
Middleweight Champion of the World, right?
Ha, ha, ha.
You only say that 'cause all you think I am is a dumb boxer.
Not true, Banta.
I don't think you're a dumb boxer.
You don't, Lou?
No.
I thank you're a bad boxer.
I think you're a dumb person.
Well, I think you guys would be real surprised if you really knew what I really thought about.
New York University, please.
NYU, right.
Hey, you know who you are?
You're Eric Sevareid.
That's right.
I'm Tony Banta.
How do you do?
You're a very famous guy.
I see you on TV a lot.
You know, I'm a cabdriver.
Why you going to NYU?
Well, I'm attending the G.O.S.G.
Conference.
Oh, yeah.
The Gathering Of Smart Guys.
I read about it in the papers.
Tonight, I'm actually going to be in a debate.
It must be tough coming up with opinions all the time.
I know-- I come up with one myself every now and then.
Makes my head hurt.
That is the price we pay.
Except nobody ever wants to listen to what I got to say.
I'd like to listen to what you've got to say.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you know what I think is stupid, Mr. Sevareid?
You don't mind if I call you Mr. Sevareid?
Certainly not.
I think it's stupid that half the world is fighting.
I mean, it seems to me that if the leaders of these countries want to fight, they should fight and leave us out of it.
I think you're going a little too fast for me, Tony.
Let the leaders of these countries put on the gloves and go a couple of rounds.
The match I'd like to see is Carter-Castro.
Castro's got the weight on him.
You know, but Jimmy's wiry, and he does a lot of roadwork.
Now, what you're suggesting is a civilized alternative to war.
There you go.
What an extraordinary idea.
Tell me, what would you do, for example, about world hunger?
World hunger, huh?
Well, like all those fancy White House parties.
Right?
Instead of inviting all those rich people, invite some poor people.
I mean, rich people can afford to feed themselves, right?
You seem to have a perspective on world events that somehow eludes the average man.
You're no slouch yourself.
You know you know, Tony, you could fit right in at the G.O.S.G.
Meeting.
How do I get in?
You just have to say something very intelligent at the door.
What should I say?
Anything you've said tonight would be fine.
Hey, if I say two smart things, can I bring a date?
I just want you to come and be on my side in the debate.
Who are we debating?
Bill Buckley Henry Kissinger and John Kenneth Galbraith.
We'll kick their butt.
Indubitably.
Now what would Tony fantasize about?
I mean, let me see.
If it's not being a dumb boxer, and it's not being a dumb cabbie, it must be a dumb something else.
: This is tough, Banta.
You could be a dumb anything.
You know, I have a fantasy.
Oh, yeah?
What is it, Latka?
Well  Wait a minute.
Before you tell them your fantasy, you want to hear my fantasy?
My fantasy is: What would it be like if all those busted cabs got fixed?
That's a good one.
Yeah?
Well, you better get back to work, otherwise you're going to be fantasizing about where your next meal's coming from.
Go on.
But Get no buts.
Just get back to work, Latka.
But Work!
Ooh Louie.
Ooh I have a fantasy all right.
Some day  Well?
Good morning, Mr. Gravas.
Hello.
You may all sit now.
Good morning.
You are looking very chipper off the old block, today.
Okay.
Ah, assistants.
Hello.
Okay.
You're feeling good today?
Yeah?
Okay, losers.
Now, we have to get all the cabs out of here.
So, Ben Garetski, you take 915.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Eh all right, Banta.
You're taking 1102.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Gravas.
I can't take 1102.
It's broken.
Broken?
Yeah, the brakes are out.
What?
Louie!
Louie De Palma!
Where is that dumb fellow?
Come on, Louie.
Oh I'm coming, Mr. Gravas.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was in the bathroom when I heard you calling me.
I'm sorry.
The bathroom?
But you went to the bathroom yesterday.
Is this going to be a habit with you?
No.
All right, no more going to the bathroom till you fix all the cabs.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now, I want to know why eh, eh, why Oh, I'll tell you, Mr. Gravas, I was going to fix it yesterday, but then I had this terrible thing happened.
My mother fell and broke her hip, and I had to take her to the hospital.
Oh, so, no excuse, huh?
All right.
I have warned you about this thing.
Eh, you know what this means?
Okay.
Attention.
Halt.
Down.
Not you.
You get Don't don't joke around with me.
Don't be wise guy.
Okay?
Don't do Now, eh I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gravas.
Now, eh, bl-blindfold?
Latka.
One last cigarette.
Okay.
Here, Lou.
He doesn't smoke.
All right.
Ready.
Aim  No, Latka, please!
Please, Latka.
No.
Please, Latka.
Latka.
Latka!
Latka!
Latka!
Latka!
What are you doing, sitting around like a zombie?
I told you to fix those cabs.
Now get back to work!
Fire.
Sunshine Cab Company.
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Tony, for you.
It's probably him.
How do I look?
Just stunning.
: Hel-lo?
Hello?
Yeah, this is Tony Banta.
Is this really you?
Hey, guys, I'm talking to Herve Villechaize.
Yeah, I'm the cabdriver that picked you up at the airport.
Yeah, you left some photos in my cab, yeah.
Pictures of you and Ricky Montalban.
Yeah, so what do you want me to do?
Bring 'em around the hotel?
I could leave 'em at the desk.
No, Banta.
Don't-don't give him those back.
Charge him for them.
You may get a reward.
Louie, Louie, leave me Come on, Banta, he's a big star.
He's rolling in dough.
He uses $20 bills to train his dog.
Anything you say, Mr. Villechaize.
"Anything you say, Mr. Villechaize".
Let me talk to him.
No way, Louie.
Come on.
You?
Yeah?
You could do that?
"You could do that"?
Sure.
You bet.
Yeah, I'll be here.
Okay.
Just goes to show you.
The bigger they are, the nicer they are.
He's coming to the garage to pick up his pictures.
You're kidding!
Banta!
I don't why you never listen to me.
Louie, the guy said the pictures weren't that important.
Banta, sometimes, you're so stupid I want to cry.
Of course he's going to say that.
That's why he's a big star, and you're a bozo.
Well, at least I get to do my impression of him in person.
Louie, if you do that impression of him, you are going to humiliate and embarrass everyone who sees it.
Why are you encouraging him?
: I'm going to do my impression, boss, and you can stick it in your ear, Rieger.
Herve's coming all the way here.
Yeah, and it wasn't even my idea.
I mean, he said he had to be in the city anyway to do some kind of promotional stuff.
Oh, you know, that's so nice that he's going to come down to the garage, you know, instead of making you go to the hotel.
I'll probably be like that when I make it as an actor, too.
Oh, you mean modest, humble, and unassuming.
Oh, wonderfully so.
You know, I might've known that you'd fantasize about being a great actor.
Elaine, you must think I'm really shallow, that that's all I ever think about is being a famous actor.
I have other dreams, too.
Ladies and gentlemen, the famous singer, Bobby Wheeler!
Bobby!
* Punches in at 7:00 * Just putting in his time * Slaving for that dollar * Got to toe the line * Ooh, ooh, all day long * You're just getting by * Waiting for that late-night high * * City boy * Love the nightlife * City girls * Dancing in the moonlight * City boy * He makes his midnight move * City girls Wheeler?
Bobby Wheeler?
Yeah, he's on the television.

Of course it is, you bum.
Who else could deliver a song like that?
Shh!
Hey, I know him.
I used to know him.
Sure you do.
Yeah.
I mean it.
I mean it.
He used to work for me.
* And he counts those hours * She's still on his mind  * Mm, but they danced with a * * At 5:00 he's gonna hit those streets * * City boy * Mm, love the moonlight  Bobby!
Bobby Wheeler!
Thank you.
Thank you.
I-I just wanted to come back and see my humble beginnings.
Yeah, this is it.
Nice to see you again.
I'll prove it.
I'll prove it.
Hey, hey, hey!
Bobby!
Bobby!
Tell them.
This drunk's been trying to say he knows you.
Just ignore him.
Tell them that I know you.
Bob, tell them.
They don't believe me, Bob.
Yeah.
It'll cost you a buck.
Bob.
Bob this is my last buck.
How am I going to eat?
Louie, you know the rules.
Come on, now, hand it over.
Come on.
Come on.
All right.
Tell them.
I never saw the man before in my life.
Bob!
Come on, drinks on me.
You got a pen?
Drinks for everybody.
* City boy * Oh, this girl will kill you * City boy * She'll make you do it.
Hi, guys.
Yo, Jim.
Hi, Jim.
How you doing?
What's up?
We're just sitting around, talking about fantasies.
Ah So, do you have any fantasies, Jim?
Nah.
You know me.
I'm a pretty down-to-earth type of guy.
Come on.
You mean to tell us you don't fantasize about nothing?
Well Uh, I don't know if you'd call it a fantasy, but sometimes I think about doing a little traveling.
You know getting away from it all.
: Jim Ignatowski?
Yo.
We want you to come with us.
Uh We want to take you to our world.
Uh, why do you want me?
You sure you got the right guy?
You don't even know me.
Oh, yes, we do.
We know you very well.
You don't understand why everybody wants jobs, why everybody wants to get ahead.
You don't know what the point is, and you don't care.
That's true.
You haven't read a newspaper in years, and you live in fear of someone starting a conversation with you about what's going on in the world.
Yeah, that's me all right.
You're wearing every piece of clothing you own.
When you talk, everyone looks puzzled.
The universe is a source of wonder and amusement to you.
Yeah, that's me.
But why do you want me to go?
Because we love and understand you.
Okeydoke.
Wow, you guys are funny looking.
Hi, guys.
Hi, Mr. Villechaize.

Oh, did you hear that?
"Mr. Banta".

Wheeler, what do you have to smile about?
I'm just looking forward to it.
Pathetic.

{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
You're never gonna believe who I had in my cab last night!
Hey, that's Herve Villechaize.
Yeah, you know, the little guy from Fantasy Island.
He left these pictures in my cab last night.
What is this, eh Fantasy Island?
Well, actually, Latka, there really isn't a Fantasy Island.
Well, I wish there was a place like that.
Imagine someplace you could go and live out all your fantasies.
You seem to have a perspective on world events that somehow eludes the average man.
You're no slouch yourself.
Ooh, I have a fantasy, all right.
Halt.
I have other dreams, too.
Ladies and gentlemen, the famous singer, Bobby Wheeler!
Hey, hey, Bobby!
Sometimes I think about doing a little traveling.
Wow!
You guys are funny-lookin'.
Mr. Villechaize, uh I do something, uh I'd like you to see.
You want to see it?
Yeah?
Okay, here we go.
: Hiya, boss.
How are you, boss?
Here come da plane, boss.
You like it?
That's fine.
That was you.
Oh, that's very fine.
Betcha he goes back to Hollywood now, eh?
Yeah That must be some exciting life he leads out there.
I betcha he does things that we can only dream about.
Are you kidding?
Don't you know what Hollywood's like?
I mean, right now, that guy's out there surrounded by perverts, weirdos, and human garbage.
Makes me glad I didn't go into show business.
You know, it's weird.
I think I have a handle on what everyone in this garage would fantasize about, but the only one that throws me is you, Alex.
I mean, what would you fantasize about?
Yeah, Alex.
Yeah, come on, Alex.
What?
What?
As a matter of fact, I don't.
Aw, sure.
I don't.
Oh, come on.
No, really.
I find it very difficult to fantasize.
You mean you never fantasize about the beautiful lady in your cab?
I mean, everybody's got that one.
Not me.
Me, either.
Aw, geez, Alex, I can't even believe it.
Well, listen, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but that's how it is: I don't.
I've tried to fantasize.
I've tried to think up some great situation, but somehow, something always goes wrong.
Hello.
Hi there.
Where can I take you?
I'm not sure where I want to go.
Just drive anywhere.
I think I know where that is.
I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but has anyone ever told you before that the back of your head is quite attractive.
Thank you.
The front's nice too.
That's something to look forward to.
You may not believe this, but this is my very first ride in a taxi.
Well, you know what they say: first time's the best time.
Well, actually, I've always heard how rude and abrupt cabbies were.
You're not that way at all.
Well, the evening is still young.
I'm really enjoying myself.
I should've done this long ago.
Me, too.
Listen, I hope you don't think this is too personal, but, um Well, even if it is Can I ask you something?
It's your cab.
Why did you decide to take this ride tonight?
I was just feeling very alone.
I'm a stranger in this big city, all by myself, and something told me I should just hail a cab.
I didn't know why till now.
Feeling a little warm?
Ever since I got into this cab.
I can turn the heat down.
I don't think you could.
So, tell me, uh, cookie what brings you to New York?
I'm here with my husband.
Son of a She's married?
!
Who's married?
Huh?
Oh, no one.
I, uh just drifted off for a second.
Oh, Alex, are you over there trying to fantasize?
Ah, no, I told you I don't do that kind of stuff.
Hey, Alex, if you're fantasizing about a woman, make her single.
Well, it's not that easy, you know.
I mean, you just can't imagine her single, and she comes out single, can you?
Yeah, you can.
Oh, well, let me give it another shot.
Look, I can't do this if you're all going to stare at me.
Oh.
Sorry.
Okay, I mean business this time.
So you're married, huh?
No, not really.
I just said that.
Why?
I was afraid you'd come on to me.
Well why are you admitting that now?
I decided I'd take my chances.
Back on course.
Listen, I don't usually do this, but, um how would you like to?
Mm never mind.
Oh, say it, please.
Ask me.
No, I think you'd find me too presumptuous.
No, no.
Say it, please.
Don't hold anything back.
I'm not.
Would you like to stop someplace and have a cup of coffee?
Oh, I'd love that.
You would?
Mm.
Well, where would you like to go?
Uh, we can go to my apartment, or if that would be too uncomfortable for you, we can go out somewhere.
Your apartment sounds fine.
In fact, your apartment sounds wonderful.
Oh, great.
This is turning into a marvelous evening.
I hope nothing comes along to spoil it.
Don't worry about it.
I couldn't stop now if I had to.
Stop.
I can't.
I can't.
Stop!
I can't even be trusted behind the wheel of my own fantasy.
You just got to relax.
You know, just free yourself, you know, and let yourself go with the flow.
Put yourself in your own apartment.
Oh, yeah, okay, that's good, that's good.
Eh?
All right?
All right?
Yeah.
Now, now picture yourself by a by a roaring fire.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's very good.
That's very good.
Okay, now, now, now, just relax and remember that it's your fantasy, and in her eyes, you can't do anything wrong.
Yeah.
You're right.
I just hope she's still alive.
More very expensive brandy?
Mmm   Am I glad that accident was only a fender bender.
You're not going to get into any trouble, are you?
No, I have a very understanding dispatcher.
Oh, this is wonderful.
Is it really wonderful?
Mm.
Yes.
Good.
I've never done anything like this before, and I've never met anyone like you before.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
What's the matter?
I just realized something.
I don't even know your name.
Does it matter?
How am I going to tell my diary about you?
Tawny.
Tawny.
My favorite name.
I'm Alex.
My favorite name.
I'm afraid something is going to go wrong.
This is just too good.
Just too good.
No, no.
This this is what you've waited for.
This is what you deserve.
Yeah.
Trust me.
I do.
Trust this.
Oh free, at last.
Oh, man.
I've always liked the name Alex.
When I was a little girl, I used to have an uncle named Alexander.
Oh, I thought he was the greatest.
I haven't seen him in years.
We lost touch long ago.
I lived in the Bronx, and his family would come and see us every now and then.
Yes, yes Oh, he'd always take me someplace-- to the park or to the playground, or the carnival, if it was in season.
But the thing that I remember most was that he'd always end the day by buying me a double-dip Rocky Road ice cream cone with a cherry on top.
Right.
How did?
Uncle Alex?
!
How's Aunt Rose?
Fine.
Cousin Harry?
Great.
Brother Bill?
Wonderful.
Your daughter?
Europe.
I think we've wasted enough time with this dumb talk of fantasies.
Fantasies are for losers.
I suppose you don't have any, Louie.
Me?
What would I need a fantasy for?
I'm usually the object of other peoples' fantasies.
Oh, sure.
It's true.
Come on, Louie, you mean you wouldn't change anything if you had the chance to?
Nothing.
My life is perfect.
Well maybe there is one or two things I might change to make it even better.
I wish we had some heat.
I'm freezing.
Yeah.
Well, you know Mr. De Palma would turn the heat up if he could.
That man, he's a saint.
Bobby's right.
As owner of this cab company, Mr. De Palma has to cooperate with President Rizzo's new energy program.
He keeps that thermostat set right where it's supposed to be  28 degrees.
You know, the Depression's a lot harder on him.
Imagine how tough it would be being the only rich man left in the country.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Here he comes now.
Huh?
Huh?
Here he comes.
On your way home, sir?
Yeah.
I'm bushed.
How are you guys doing?
Awful.
Yeah.
This Depression is a darn shame, isn't it?
That's a mighty nasty cough you got there, Rieger.
Oh, it's nothing, sir.
Just a touch of double pneumonia.
It's going around.
Nevertheless, I think you better see my doctor.
Have him take a look at you.
Oh that's much too kind of you, sir.
Now, now, now, never mind, never mind.
That could be bronchitis on top of pneumonia.
That's what Wheeler's got, and he's dying, aren't you, Wheeler?
Yes, sir.
That's the spirit.
You almost done in there?
Not quite.
All right, well, keep at it.
I'm home.
Louie!
Louie, darling.
I've missed you so much.
Why are you dressed like that?
Because it's so warm in here.
You keep it at 85.
Mm-hmm.
You know, Louie, all day long, I've been praying that you'll reconsider firing you-know-who.
Not a chance.
Not a chance.
I think I've been fair.
When somebody doesn't pull their weight they're gone.
But she loves you so much.
I know.
Send her in.
He wants to see you, Lassie.
Come on in and sit down.
Sit down.
Bye, Lassie.
Bye.
Nardo, you're taking some of the surprise out of this.
Now, get out of here.
It's just you and me, girl.
Lassie I know you've you've been with us a long time.
I don't know I just have to do something with you.
I mean, you're getting away with murder.
You know?
I've got to lay down the laws.
Benji she's going through the roof.
Snoopy-- through the roof.
I mean, what can you do?
That's just not enough anymore, girl.
I mean, they're out there making millions.
Do you know what Benji made last year?
Uh-huh.
Well, how much did you make last year?
Well, that just doesn't cut it, Lassie.
Take a walk.
All right, but just one.
Okay, now beat it.
Aw It was so sad seeing her go.
Yeah, well  Maybe this will make you feel better.
It's a little something I picked up on the way home.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Oh, well.
A man can dream, can't he?
Hey, uh, come on, Elaine.
You're trying to get everybody else to talk about their fantasies.
Why don't you tell us one of yours?
Yeah!
Forget it!
I mean, if nobody else is going to talk about it, why should I?
Yeah, you're right.
No point.
Let's forget it.
But if I were to tell you my fantasy it would knock you out.
Yeah?
Oh, really?
Come on, come on, come on, what is it?
Anybody got any ideas about what we can do?
Let's play another hand of poker.
We always play cards.
We play cards every day.
That's all we do is play cards.
