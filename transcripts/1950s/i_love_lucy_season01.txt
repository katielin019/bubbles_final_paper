{START OF EPISODE 0}
In this city live Lucy and Ricky Ricardo.
Of course, you know Ricky as a famous orchestra leader and singer and Lucy as the famous, uh Well, she's her hair is very red, and she's married to Ricky.
In this district, close to theaters and nightclubs where Ricky works, they have a little apartment where they laugh, love, and thoroughly enjoy life.
They live in this apartment here on the seventh floor.
Now, let's look in.
No, no, no, not that apartment.
Yes, that's right.
Okay.
It's 11:00 now.
They should be getting up.
Ricky is one of those individuals who wakes up in the morning bright and cheery.
On the other hand, Lucy is one of those individuals who, when she wakes up in the morning  He looks like he got in later than I did.
I wonder whatever happened to my type.
Ricky?
Ricky?
Ricky?
!
Yes, Lucy, what is it?
If you had known how I look in the morning, would you still have married me?
Well, would you?
I'm trying to decide.
I was just teasing you, honey.
You look beautiful to me all the time.
You were not "tizzing" me.
I know you, Ricky Ricardo.
Just because you're going to be a big television star, you're casting me aside like an old shoe.
"Jints you"?
Yeah, jints.
J-I-N um um "X"?
"X"?
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't have to spell it.
It means "bad luck".
Some sponsors are coming to the club to see my show, and if they like it, they'll put it on television.
That's all.
What night are they coming?
Do you know?
No.
You do, too.
I do not.
They're going to tell my agent, and Jerry will tell me as soon as he knows.
Well, it doesn't matter.
You'll never be a success on television anyway.
What?
What do you mean I won't be a success on television?
You don't have a pretty girl in your act.
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi, here we go again.
On television, you have to have a pretty girl to demonstrate the sponsor's product.
Yeah?
Sure-- she eats it or drinks it or smokes it or waxes the floor with it or cuts potatoes with it or drives off in it.
Sure.
How would you like to have your sponsor's product demonstrated by a gorgeous redhead?
I'd love it.
You know where I can find one?
Ah Ay!
Oh, Ricky, stop.
You're getting lather all over.
Never mind that.
Help me find my ear.
You didn't really lose an ear.
Huh?
: Stop.
Okay, you talked me into it.
You can demonstrate the sponsor's product on the show.
Good.
What is it?
Men's shorts.
Oh Now, look, Lucy, you know how I feel about this.
I don't want my wife in show business.
Why?
Why?
I asked you first.
Oh, honey, we've been over this 10,000 times.
I want a wife who is just a wife.
Now, look, all you got to do is clean the house for me, hand me my pipe when I come home at night, cook for me, and be the mama for my children.
You don't smoke a pipe.
It doesn't matter.
Just do the others.
You're missing a good bet.
I say you're missing a good bet.
Am I?
Yeah.
How do you figure?
Because I can sing.
Huh?
And dance.
What else?
And tell jokes.
How about it?
No.
Oh, you have no imagination.
I'll bet if Ziegfeld or Earl Carroll had seen me, they'd sign me up like that.
As what?
As a beautiful showgirl.
Go answer the door.
Hello, Jerry.
Hiya, baby.
Well, this is it, boy.
Tonight is the night!
This is it!
Tonight is the night!
S-S-Shh!
What do you mean, "Shoosh"?
Shout it from the housetops, boy.
This is it!
Tonight is the night the sponsors are coming down to catch your show for TV.
Fine, fine, but I don't want Lucy to hear.
If she knows the audition is tonight, she'll pester the life out of me.
Oh, I see.
Well, have you got everything all set?
Sure, everything's fine.
Can you get that clown act you want to put in the show?
You mean Pepito?
Yeah, Pepito, the fella that rides on the bicycle.
Yeah, I'll have him do the bicycle act, and then he can do that cello bit.
That's good.
Fine.
Then everything is all taken care of, huh?
Everything's fine.
Okay, I'll see you down at the club later.
All right, Jerry.
Good.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Oh, ooh!
I almost forgot.
The lawyer gave me this yesterday.
He wants you and Lucy to hey, what am I whispering for?
He wants you and Lucy to sign it, and I'll take it right back to him.
What is it?
Well, you know, I don't think he has much confidence that you'll be a success in television.
It's your will.
He's been talking about that for months.
Well, come on, boy.
Let's get going with it.
Get it signed because on account of you I got to take it all the way back downtown.
Hey, wait a minute, Jerry.
You run along.
I'll have Lucy take it down to the attorneys.
Lucy?
Well, now, why should she have to go all the way down there?
It'll take her most of the day, and I won't have her in my hair during rehearsals.
Oh, I see.
Is she still trying to get in the act?
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.
Ah, well, I give up.
I tell you, I'll see you later, huh?
All right, Jerry.
Hey, now, don't forget: knock 'em dead tonight.
Lucy, I got something Lucy?
No.
And that's final.
Hurry up, honey.
Coming, master.
Who was that at the door?
Jerry.
Jerry?
What did he say?
Does he know anything yet?
What did he say?
What did he say?
"What did he say?
What did he say?
What did he say"?
Nothing.
Just business.
He brought my will.
Oh.
I'll get your toast for you.
Your will?
Yeah.
What's the matter, Ricky?
Nothing is the matter.
There is, too.
You're keeping something from me.
: You're sick.
I never felt better in my whole life.
Then you lied to me when we were married.
You're really older than I think.
Now, look, honey, this is just good business.
The lawyer said I should have a will.
Then everything is legally taken care of if anything happens, that's all.
I won't discuss it.
Look, you have to know what to do, so that you know what you going to happen when, when I go.
All right, Ricky.
That's better.
Now what's the matter?
Oh, Ricky, I miss you so!
For goodness' sakes, Lucy, I haven't gone yet.
Don't go, Ricky.
Don't go!
Now, look, honey, I'm perfectly well.
I feel fine.
But let's face it: we all have to go sometime.
We do?
We do unless you know something the rest of us don't.
No, I "dun't".
I'll get your toast for you.
All right.
He brought your will along, too.
My will?
Yeah.
What for?
You're the one that's going.
Now, Lucy What are you trying to do, shove me ahead of you in line?
Look, honey, this isn't my idea.
It's the lawyers'.
We got to get them signed, and you got to take it down to the attorneys today.
Impossible.
I have an appointment to have my hair dyed.
Washed.
They got to go today.
Aw, Ricky, the attorney's way downtown.
It'll take me all day.
Yeah, I know.
Look, Lucy, forget about the toast.
I got to go to the club.
Oh, Ricky, do I have to take them down today?
Can't they wait?
Absolutely not.
Why not?
Well well, suppose you didn't take them down till tomorrow.
Yes?
And we both got killed today.
Yes?
How could you take them down tomorrow?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Babalu aye Babalu aye Babalu aye Babalu aye Yeah!
Fellows, what's the use of having a rehearsal if we're not going to do it right?
When you sing, don't go, "Ah, ah, ah, ah".
Go "Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah"!
Let's put some pep into the thing, you know?
All right?
Okay, all right.
Pepito!
Haven't you got your costume on yet?
I'm coming!
All right.
Start my music!
Come on, let's go!
All right.
Let's get "Valencia".
Siempre elegante.
Aydame un poquito.
Como no, mucho gusto.
Ah, thanks, SeÃ±or Ricardo, muchas gracias.
My impression of a baby cry.
Awwww!
The world's smallest bicycle.
Make myself comfortable, Balley, SeÃ±or Balley.
No, trombonista.
Hey, Don Carmen, Don Pepe, that's wonderful.
Te gusta, eh?
Very good.
Listen, aren't you going to do the big bicycle, you know, the zigzag business?
Oh, the zigzag?
Yeah.
All right?
Okay, vamos a ver.
Okay.
Pepito!
Pepito!
Pepito!
Are you all right?
Well, I'm alive.
All you need is a little rest.
Help him along there.
I go home.
No, Pepito, don't go home, would you?
That's too far.
Why don't you go over to my apartment?
There's nobody there.
You can rest for a couple of hours.
Okay.
All right?
My bicycle broke!
They'll help you with it.
Will you help him?
Sure.
Take it easy now, Pepe, will you?
I, I, I'll be all right.
All right.
You go and finish your rehearsal.
All right, Pepe, take it easy now.
Go with him, would you, fellows?
Let's, uh, let's take "The Continental".
"The Continental," you ready?
Okay.
All right, all right.
What kind of a start is that?
All right, all right.
Drum roll.
It's me.
It's me, Pepito!
Pepito!
What are you doing here?
I hurt myself at rehearsal.
Ricky told me to come here and rest.
What are you doing at rehearsal?
Are they getting ready for that television audition?
It's tonight.
Tonight!
Why, that big bum.
So that's why he wanted me to traipse all the way downtown.
Just to get rid of me.
Well, how do you feel, Pepito, all right?
Uh, not so good.
Gee, what's Ricky going to do if you're not there?
Who will he get?
I don't know.
Maybe you can take my place.
Oh, don't be ridicu Hey Pepito!
Yeah?
You look awful.
I do?
Yeah, you're, you're hurt worse than you think.
I am?
!
Yeah, you'd better lie down and rest.
No, no, no, I, I, I, I need, I need to do it for Ricky.
Feels pretty good.
It does, huh?
I think I can do it.
You do, huh?
Yup, yeah, I think I can do it just fine.
Hup!
Eh!
Still think you can make it tonight, Pepito?
Here, did, did, did, did Pepito show up yet?
No, he has not come.
Oh, my goodness, here we are, we're giving the audition, the sponsor's out there, and, and he's not here yet.
What am I going to do?
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll do one more number, and if he doesn't show up by then, I, I'll just have to close the show.
All right?
All right.
Okay.
Eh, we'll do "Cabbie," eh?
Give me the hat.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for a minute, please?
You know, the last time that we went to Havana, we met a fellow down there that we'd like to talk to you about because he's really quite a character.
He, uh, he drives a horse and buggy in Havana.
As a matter of fact, he drives the only horse and buggy left in Havana.
He, uh, he doesn't believe in taxi cabs.
He says a taxi cab and a Havana moon don't go well together.
So he's broke all the time, but he's happy.
Everybody knows him down there.
They all like him, and they call him "The Cuban Cabbie".
And if you want to see him, all you got to do is just come down with me to Havana.
We sit in the open air cafes in El Prado.
And he'll be riding up and down the boulevard.
Every night.
And if you happen to be in the mood for listening, you probably hear him singing something like this.
Giddyap there, Pinto.
I forgot to tell you.
"Pinto" is the name of the horse.
My horse and carriage is for hire, SeÃ±ora For just as long as you desire SeÃ±orita Do you want to ride Forget the maÃ±ana and come to Havana with me I'm the Cuban Cabbie I'm the Cuban Cabbie The taxi drivers drive you frantic, you know Oh, but my rig is more romantic and so Do you want to ride?
An eye full of splendor and you can depend upon me I'm the Cuban Cabbie And I need dinero Money, that is.
The moon is peeping, the shadows creeping It's time for riding through the park A lovely night for lovers The same as you two are If you like music, I'll give you music As we go riding in the dark I'll sing Spanish love songs to the strains of my guitar Esa luna que tienes Cielito lindo, junto a la boca No se, no besa a nadie, cielito lindo I'm just kidding fellow.
Si a mi me toca Aye, aye, ya, aye Everybody, sing, sing!
Canta y no llores Canta!

She's getting hysterical.

Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

You've been a wonderful audience, but I am afraid that we're going to close : Have you seen a fellow named Risky Riskerdoe?
Have you seen a fellow named Risky Riskerdoe?

I never dreamed they'd offer me a contract.
What are you going to do about it?
What do you want me to do, Ricky?
You know what I want.
All I want you to do is just clean the house Oh, I-I've been cleaning the house ever since I got home.
and hand me my pipe And cook for you and be the mama for your children.
Let's see you pull that out of your pocket.
Well, I kind of wanted to talk to you about that, Ricky.
I have a surprise for you.
You do?
Yeah, something that should make you very happy.
Lucy you mean?
Yes, darling.
I baked your favorite pie.
{END OF EPISODE 0}{START OF EPISODE 1}
Here, you missed something on this one.
That's the design.
It is?
Sure, can't you see.
Flowers against a background of gravy.
I've been meaning to talk to you about Monday night.
We want you and Ricky to help us celebrate.
It's our wedding anniversary.
Oh, yours and Fred's?
No, me and Gregory Peck.
We've been married for 18 years and I vowed that at least once before I died Fred was going to take me to a nightclub on our wedding anniversary.
Well, that sounds reasonable.
Now this is my plan.
We'll go in there and I'll say: "I know what let's do next Monday night.
Let's go to a nightclub.
" And you second the motion.
Then Ricky will bound to his feet and say "That's great.
" Then Fred will have to take me Ricky bounds to his feet and says, "That's great"?
Right.
Wrong, Ricky hates nightclubs.
But he works in one.
Your life should be just one gay round of nightclubs.
Yeah, that's what I thought when I married a bandleader, but ever since we said "I do" there are so many things we don't.
Well, it was a good idea while it lasted.
Gee, it was going to be the Copacabana.
The Copacabana.
Uh-huh.
Gee!
Well, don't you worry, we'll go!
We will?
Sure, I want to go as much as you do.
But don't forget you can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar.
You mean, be nice to the boys?
Yeah, we'll be so lovey-dovey to them that they'll be sitting in a nightclub before they know what hit them.
Oh, that ought to do it.
Sure.
Hey, Rick, are you doing anything Monday night?
I don't think so.
It's my night off, why?
I'd like you to join me in commemoration of an 18-year-old tragedy.
What do you mean?
Well, it's our wedding anniversary.
Oh, you want us to join you in a celebration?
I prefer to think of it as a grim reminder.
I'd like to go over to Charlie's steak house and then take in the fights.
Oh, you dreamer, you.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I don't know, Fred.
If you want to go to the fights, I think you should.
After all, it's your anniversary.
There must be some way we can get the girls to go to the fights.
Yeah, we can tie them in sacks and carry them in.
I tell you what!
As soon as they come into the living room we'll be real nice to them, see soft-soap them a little smoosh 'em up.
Smoosh?
Ethel?
Now, look, everybody knows you can get around a woman with a little sweet talk.
Well, that's all right for Lucy but it's a longer trip around Ethel.
Do you want to go to the fights, or don't you?
All right, all right, I'll smooch.
Okay, now How can four people use so many dishes?
I don't know.
What's the matter?
What you standing up for?
Because two gorgeous ladies entered the room.
They did, where?
They mean us.
Oh!
You great big Latin lover, you!
Oh, you sweet handsome man, you!
You gorgeous exciting woman, you!
I pass.
Aw, isn't he cute?
Darling, why don't you sit down here.
Oh, yes, you sit down, too, baby.
Well, you sit down on my lap.
You'll be more comfortable there.
All right.
You sit there, darling.
This chair is more comfortable.
Oh, but if it's so comfortable I want you to have it.
Ethel, do one thing that I ask, will you, please?
I said sit down!
Ethel, don't you think you're overdoing it a little?
How about a cigarette?
I'll get them.
No, don't trouble yourself.
Oh!
Oh, sorry.
Thank you very much.
That's all right.
Thank you, Lucy.
Thank you very much.
It's all right.
Light, light?
You know, Ricky, baby, there's only one time you look handsomer than you do now and that's when you wear a tuxedo.
Oh, yes, I think a tuxedo is the best- looking thing a man can wear.
Unless he's wearing boxing trunks.
Speaking of boxing there's nothing more exciting than a ringside seat.
Yes, sir, a ringside seat at the Copacabana.
Yeah.
Well, look, Lucy, Monday is Fred's anniversary and he wants to go to the fights.
Yeah, well, Monday's Ethel's anniversary, too, and she wants to go to a nightclub.
Yeah, well, Fred is not going to go to any stuffy nightclub.
Well, Ethel's not going to any stale fights.
Lucy, don't push me too far.
It's the fights or nothing.
Well, is that final?
Final.
Then you brought this on yourself.
Ethel wants a divorce.
Good.
No, she doesn't!
No, I don't!
Well, honey, you said you wanted to go Why don't you mind your own business?
Wait a minute, will you!
Everybody be calm!
We'll figure out a way to settle this thing.
I know, the democratic way!
We'll put it to a vote.
Couldn't you guess how it's going to come out?
We'll try it anyhow.
All right, everybody wants to go to the fights raise their hand.
One, two.
Everybody wants to go to the nightclub raise their hands.
One, two, three.
All right, I guess we'll have to go to the Copaca Three?
Lucy!
Well, I don't care.
We want to go to the Copacabana.
We're going to the fights.
If you go to the fights, you can just go alone.
Okay, if that's the way you want it and I hope you have a nice, pleasant evening at home.
Who's staying at home?
Ethel and I are going dancing at the Copa.
I hope one of you knows how to lead.
We will not be dancing together, smarty.
We will have dates.
We will?
Oh, we will, we will!
Date, Ethel with a date?
Dates!
That's very funny!
Go ahead and laugh.
I know just who our dates will be, and they're both tall, dark and handsome and young.
Who are they?
You'll just die when I tell you.
Two of the most eligible young bachelors in town.
Of course I can't talk while certain parties are in the room.
Well, whisper their names to me.
Okay.
No!
Yes!
I guess we can take a hint.
Come on downstairs to my apartment, Rick.
I don't like the atmosphere up here.
Yeah.
Lucy, what were those names you whispered to me?
What did they sound like?
It sounded like Little Boy Blue and Peter Cottontail.
That's who it was.
Huh?
Well, I was just trying to put up a big front while the boys were here.
That's what I was afraid of.
Where can we get any dates?
Don't give up so easily.
We'll find some men somewhere.
Where?
There's no place where millions of single women haven't already looked.
Well, how about No.
Uh No.
Oh, we're not concentrating.
We must know two men who are single and attractive.
Two men who are single?
Two men?
A boy and a dog?
No, maybe we should settle for Little Boy Blue and Peter Cottontail.
I know.
What?
I'll get my address book, call up some of my old boyfriends.
Oh, Lucy.
It's only 11 years old.
Oh!
Well, after all, it's worth a try.
This is an emergency.
I'll start at the A's.
George Anderson.
Hmm, Butterfield 89970.
Brother, will Monday be a night!
We'll go over to Charlie's and we'll get steaks this thick and we'll have big slices of raw onions all over 'em.
And there won't be any women around to tell us we can't eat them.
Do you suppose they really can get dates?
Well, who cares.
Why don't you stop worrying about them.
I keep thinking that they'll go out to dinner somewhere and they'll have some champagne then they'll go to the Copacabana and have more champagne and then they'll dance and have more champagne and who knows what will happen.
Yeah, with all that champagne even Ethel might look good.
Well, what are we going to do, Rick?
Well, we could get dates, too and go to the Copacabana and keep an eye on them.
No, that's not a very good idea.
Dates!
You said dates.
Ricky, that's the most sensational idea you ever had!
And we owe it to ourselves.
We can get a couple of blondes just to help us keep our eye on our wives who've seen fit to go out with other men!
Yeah.
And they couldn't get mad at us by being with other girls because they're there with other fellows.
What a dream situation.
And I bet you know a million gals.
Where's your address book?
I burned it.
Burned it!
I hadn't been in this country very long and Lucy said it was part of the American marriage ceremony.
That's absolutely criminal.
I bet you could have got a fortune for that book.
"A" alone was worth a hundred bucks.
Hey, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll call Ginny Jones.
You mean the girl that sings at the Starlight Roof?
Yeah.
She's married now, but she knows every girl in town.
I'm glad you thought of her.
Yes, well, it's been nice talking to you, Paul.
Yes, it's been a long time.
My, my, seven children.
Yes, it's been a long time.
Yes, well, all right, good-bye, Paul.
Well, that takes care of old Wagner.
Yeah, Excelsior Cleaners, Yum Yum Market and Sam Zabaglione.
Sam Zabaglione, he must be around.
Nobody would marry him.
Plaza 52099.
Did you call up Howard Thompson?
He isn't marked off.
Yeah, he's busy Monday night.
Baby-sitting with his grandson.
Oh, yeah.
Grandson!
Well, don't look at me like that!
When I dated him he was an interesting older man.
Hello, hello, is this Sam Zabaglione's house?
Oh, no, no, no, don't call your daddy to the phone.
I don't want to talk Little girl, paisan!
Well, we can always call the zoo and order a couple of dancing bears.
Oh!
Why didn't I think of this before.
Who are you calling?
Who, who, who?
Quiet, you sound like an owl.
Well, who are you calling?
Ginny Jones, she works at the Starlight Roof and she knows every man in town.
Oh, I feel hopeful again.

But the dates will be Ethel and me.

That's right.
Just leave the rest to us, Ginny.
Okay, bye.
I wonder what they'll be like.
Ginny said that they were just knockouts.
Real dreams.
Gorgeous willowy figures.
Sweet dispositions.
I wonder why they wanted to meet us here at the apartment.
Well, maybe they want to be with us alone.
Well, why?
Now, now, don't fight it.
Just be thankful our wives have got early dinner dates.
Hello, there!

It's past his bedtime.
He's got a rehearsal in the morning.
Killjoy, come on over here and sit down.
Now hold it!
Wait a minute!
He's right, that's it.
I have to rehearse in the morning.
Oh, are you an actor feller?
No, no.
A dancer feller?
No, I'm a singer feller.

Well, sing something.

No, I couldn't.
Really, I couldn't.

Yeah, let's smoke it up a bit.
I had a pack here a minute ago.
I know where they are, sonny, I'll get 'em for you.
Here you are, sonny.
I would like to get a glass of water.
Come on, Fred.
What's a matter, sonny?
Can't you carry a glass of water by yourself?
Let's get out of here while we got a chance.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Wait for what?
Come back here.
Did you notice that she knew exactly where the cigarettes were and the matches, too?
Yeah, that was kind of funny, wasn't it?
You know who those two creeps are in there?
That's Lucy and Ethel.
Oh, no, I'd know my own wife, wouldn't I?
I bet you Fred.
No.
By gosh, it is Ethel.
What do they think they're getting away with?
Never mind, look, look, never mind, never mind.
Just forget it.
I got a wonderful idea to get even with them.
Yeah, what?
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll turn the tables on them, see.
As soon as we get back in there, we'll give them that same wolf treatment they've been giving us.
Ricky, you're a genius.
Let's go.
Come on.
Oh, there you are, Ricky boy.
I've been waiting to pitch a little woo with you hog-center style.
Okay, only I thought we'd do it Latin style.
Latin style?
Yeah.
Hey hey, now, take it easy!
Now wait just a Hey, just a minute!
Come here.
Ma!
I'm getting out of here.
I'm coming with you!
This smart aleck's trying to unbutton my high-top shoes.
Call us again, Lucy.
Nice to have met you, Ethel.
Why, Fred Mertz!
You knew it all the time!
Well, not all the time.
You were pretty convincing.
Wait a minute, what are we laughing at?
You two bums were going out with other women.
Yeah!
Now, now, now, listen, listen.
I swear we were only getting dates to go to the Copa just to keep an eye on you girls.
Is that the truth?
Upon my honor, passion flower.
What do you think?
Now, look, just to convince you that we're on the level, you two girls go and change your clothes and we'll all go out and celebrate the Mertz's anniversary.
Right!
Oh, Ricky!
Happy anniversary, Ethel.
Thank you, Lucy.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
More coffee, dear?
Ricky, you want some more coffee?
Are your eggs all right, dear?
Are your eggs "How are your eggs, Lucy"?
"Oh, they're just fine, thank you.
" "Would you care for some more coffee"?
"Oh, no, thanks.
It's just right, thank you.
" "You're a wonderful cook.
" "Oh!
Do you really think so?
Oh, thank you.
" "Would you care for sugar in your coffee"?
"Oh, well, thank you, don't mind if I do.
" You are back there, aren't you?
Answer it, dear.
Good morning, is the lady of the house in?
Luce!
What are you doing out there?
The least you could do is stay here and have breakfast with your husband in the morning.
Oh, I only got ten minutes to get to rehearsal.
Bye, honey.
I'll see you for dinner.
Morning, Lucy.
: Hello!
How are things?
Just fine.
What's the matter, aren't you hungry?
Somebody's disposition got up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
Did you and Ricky have words?
We had words all right, but they were all mine.
I'm sick and tired of eating breakfast opposite a newspaper.
Does Ricky hide behind his newspaper in the morning?
He certainly does!
Does he ignore you and refuse to answer questions?
Exactly.
Well, this is a case for Dr. Humphries.
Dr. Who-phries?
Dr. Humphries- he just wrote a book called How to Keep the Honeymoon From Ending.
Is that a "Book of the Week" selection?
Uh-huh.
We have that book.
Well, you should read it.
Why?
What could Dr. Humphries possibly know about Ricky?
I'll show you.
Where's the book?
Over there on the desk, I guess.
Well, now let's see.
Here: "Chapter One: When Love is on the Wane.
"Often after the first years of marriage, "the husband seems to lose interest in the wife.
"He reads the paper at the breakfast table.
"He doesn't answer when you talk to him.
"In short, he doesn't seem to know you are alive.
" I wonder where Dr. Humphries ever met Ricky.
"More than likely, this unfortunate condition is the fault of the wife.
" What?
!
That's a lot of nonsense.
"Contrary to what some wives may think, this is not a lot of nonsense.
" Well.
"Research shows that this condition starts "when the wife becomes careless "about her appearance.
"Let her ask herself these questions: "Does she come to breakfast with her hair in curlers"?
"Is she sloppy in her attire"?
"Does she forget to make up her face"?
"Is the answer to these questions 'Yes'?
"Then it is time for the wife to do something about it.
" What?
"Dress up for your husband at breakfast.
"Be glamorous and sophisticated.
"Make yourself so attractive, "he not only will pay attention to you during breakfast, he won't even want to leave for the office.
" I'll do it.
Tomorrow morning, I'll be simply dazzling.
Good morning, Ricky darling.
More coffee, Ricky darling?
Sugar, dear?
Cream?
Jam on your toast, sweetheart?
I want a divorce.
That's nice, dear.
Fuego!
Fuego!
Fuego!
Lucy, get out!
Fire!
Fire!
What's the matter with you?
You crazy or something?
Look at me.
Well?
You don't look so good.
Let me see your tongue.
Say "Ah.
" Ah.
I think you better go and see a doctor.
There's nothing the matter with me.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Well, thank goodness.
Good-bye, sweetheart.
Got to go.
But Ricky Oh, Ethel and that stale book of hers.
Hello.
Hello, Ethel, what you doing?
I'm eating a donut.
Well, come on up here and have coffee with me, will you?
What are you talking about?
I can't understand you; will you talk into the phone?
What?
Oh, hi, Ethel, I'll be with you in a minute.
I got to hang up now, Ethel, Ethel's here.
I've been here all along.
Oh.
Gee, you look great.
Thank you.
Well, is everything okey-dokey?
No, everything is inky-stinky.
What happened?
Nothing!
He didn't even notice me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can't imagine why it didn't work.
Well, let's see what Dr. Humphries has to say.
Oh, forget that tired Dr. Humphries.
"Be glamorous in the morning.
"Be sophisticated.
This method cannot fail.
" Ha!
Ha!
Now, just a minute.
Let's look at chapter two.
"If the method in chapter one fails-" And it did.
"If the method in chapter one fails, you should next try the 'Be a Pal' system.
" "'Be a Pal' system"?
"Share your husband's interests.
"Join in his hobbies.
"If he hunts, take up hunting.
"If he fishes, take up fishing.
If he golfs, take up golfing.
" Ricky plays poker- I'll have to take up poking.
Hey, Ricky's playing tonight, isn't he?
Yeah, with Fred and the boys down in our apartment.
I'm joining that game.
Attagirl.
Oh, wait a minute.
I don't know how to play poker.
So what?
I can teach you in a couple of hours.
Okay, how do we start?
Well, it's a lot like hearts, only you bet and there isn't any old maid.
Aces and tens.
Hold it, Curly.
Three ladies.
Your deal, Charlie.
Hiya, fellas.
Hiya, Charlie.
Hiya, Hank.
Hello.
Lucy, what's going on?
Well, thought I'd join the game, if you guys don't mind.
Well What goes?
Look, honey, we'd love to play with you, but you don't know how to play poker.
Oh, yes, I do.
Ethel taught me this afternoon.
Oh, no!
Honey, please, now, we're trying I'll just sit right in here.
Could you move over a bit, Hank?
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
You mind, Hank?
Not really.
You fellas?
I guess not.
Well, go on.
Deal the cards, Charlie.
Deal 'em!
I don't have any of those little round things.
Here, I'll finance you.
Oh, is this money?
Ooh!
Ooh!
A queen.
There's her sister.
Honey, you're supposed to keep your cards a secret.
Oh.
Ooh!
What'd you get, Fred?
What'd you get?
Well, I shouldn't talk, but you can tell your two Andrews Sisters not to wait up for Laverne.
I'll open for two.
I'm in.
Honey, if you want to stay in the pot, you've got to put in two chips.
Oh, oh.
Cards?
Two.
Three for me, please.
Three.
How many cards you want, Lucy?
Oh, do I get more?
Honey, you've got to get rid of your worst cards in order to get new ones.
Oh, my!
This is a problem.
Honey, please, you're holding up the game.
Well, I can't decide whether to throw away my two queens or my three kings.
What are you doing that for?
'Cause as much as we hate to admit it, you won.
I did?
Hey, this is fun.
You deal, Hank.
I think I'll deal this one, fellas.
Lucy, it's his I'll fix it.
You got your five?
Yeah.
I got my five.
Everybody got their cards?
Thank you.
There.
I open for two.
I'm in.
I'll stay.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm in.
Oh.
Cards, honey.
Cards, please.
Oh.
No, the other way around, dear.
I'm fine.
You look tired.
Two.
Two.
Three for me, please.
I'll take four.
I bet three.
I'm out.
Me, too.
I'm folding.
How about you, Peeping Tom?
Well, I'll bet five.
Oh, you're raising me?
I am?
There's your raise, and I'll raise you two.
Well, there's your raise, and I'll raise you three.
There's your raise, and I'll raise you four.
Well, there's your raise, and I'll raise you Ricky?
What?
Run over it for me, will you?
Run over what?
You know, what beats what.
Two pairs beat a pair.
Go on.
Three of a kind beats two pair.
Go on.
A straight beats three of a kind.
Go on.
A flush beats a straight.
Go on.
A full house beats a flush.
Go on.
Four of a kind beats a full house.
That's the one!
They're all yours.
Whee!
Oh, boy.
Honey, just out of curiosity what were your four of a kind?
I didn't have four of a kind, I had a pair.
Sure see?
Two nines.
Lucy?
Yeah.
This one is a nine Uh-huh.
And this one is a six.
Oh, what do you know about that.
I didn't even have a pair.
Isn't that funny?
Gee, this is fun.
Let's play a wild game.
Everything wild but the old maid.
Oh, forget that book, will you?
As far as I'm concerned, Dr. Humphries can go jump-phrey.
This morning, Ricky didn't even speak to me.
He hasn't been speaking to you in the morning for weeks.
Well, it was the way he didn't speak to me.
And Dr. Humphries knows why.
"Chapter three: One thing to remember "about the 'Be a Pal' system in chapter two, "if you play games with your husband be sure not to beat him.
" Now he tells me.
"If methods one and two have failed, "there is one last desperate measure.
I suggest that the wife become a mother.
" I suggest he mind his own business.
Now, let me finish.
"Most men marry a woman "that reminds them of their mother.
"This is because most men "have happy memories "of their carefree childhood.
So mother your husband; baby him.
" Treat Ricky like a baby?
"And surround him with things that will remind him of his boyhood.
" I don't think I know how to fold one of these things.
He doesn't mean that.
Oh.
You know, I wouldn't be surprised if your whole trouble is that Ricky misses Cuba.
Oh, Ethel, that's ridiculous.
No, it isn't.
You should fix this place up to remind him of his happy childhood in Cuba.
What do you want me to do, plant a banana tree in the kitchen?
You'll have to be more drastic than that.
This time, you really got to shock him.
You're right.
This time, he'll notice me or I'll know the reason why.
Now, what can we do?
Well, what do you know about his childhood?
Well, not very much.
He had five brothers, and his mother was a great singer and dancer.
Perfect!
What do you mean, perfect?
I couldn't remind him of his mother.
As a dancer, I got two left feet, and as a singer, I sound like a bull moose pulling his foot out of the mud.
So what?
You've got a record player, haven't you?
Yeah.
Well, we'll buy a record and I'll play it here in the kitchen while you pretend to While I pretend to That's it.
Aha!
Hey, amigo SeÃ±or?
Clem?
Â¿Que paso?
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I must be in the wrong apartment.
Oh, no, seÃ±or.
This is it, your apartment.
Your mama, he will be here in a momento.
OlÃ©!
How are you, my little cucaracha?
How you like the hacienda, eh?
Lucy, have you gone off your rocker?
Pedro, Pablo, Chucho, Jojosisi, Jose- la, la!
Your brother is home.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute!
Lucy, what's going on?
We have big fiesta- frijoles, taco, enchilada, tamale, huevos ranchitas, guacamole and wacko taco.
Big fiesta!
Yay!
Big fiesta!
Lucy, please, would you mind telling me what's going on?
We make everything nice like when you little boy in Cuba.
You like?
No, I don't.
Oh, you don't?
Now, look, would you please explain to me what is the idea of all this?
Well, I thought you were getting tired of me and if our home reminded you of Cuba you might like me better.
Oh, honey.
Oh, Lucy darling.
If I wanted things Cuban, I'd have stayed in Havana.
That's the reason I married you, because you're so different from anyone I've known in Cuba.
Who did you know in Cuba?
Come here.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Oh, boy, I ate too much.
Me, too.
I can hardly move.
They make quite a picture, don't they, Lucy?
Yeah- Porky and Fatso taking it easy.
Please, now, please.
No nagging on a full stomach.
Besides, it's your own fault.
You put too much food on the table.
You didn't have to eat everything in sight.
I only ate 12 oysters.
Fred, did you really eat 16 oysters?
You heard what the oyster counter said.
But I was doing it for you.
I was trying to find you a pearl.
Well, don't pick on him.
Ricky ate more oysters than all of us put together.
Naturally.
What do you mean, naturally?
Because I got more Rs in my name than anyone else.
Anyhow, the way you gals were shoveling in that food I thought you were using a conveyor belt.
Can't help it, eating's my hobby.
Yeah, you ought to watch that, Ethel.
Course, it doesn't matter what I eat because it doesn't go to fat.
Where does it go to, thin?
For your information, loverboy, I weigh exactly the same as I did when we were married.
Ha!
Well, I do.
Oh, come now, Lucy.
Ethel and Fred and I have all admitted that we're getting a little fat.
A little puffy, perhaps.
Now, why don't you break down and admit it, too?
Well, I'd be very happy to join your tubby little trio if it were true, but it isn't.
Oh, Lucy, you're among friends.
Let's be honest.
I am honest!
When Ricky and I were married, I weighed 110, and I weigh exactly that right now.
We shall see.
Now, don't bother getting those bathroom scales- they're broken.
I fixed them this morning.
Oh.
Anyway, I'm getting a little bored with this discussion.
Aren't you?
No.
Oh, whose side are you on anyway?
I'm on the side of Ricky and his puffy pal.
Okay, on the scales, champ.
This I got to see.
Come on, on the scales.
No!
You're the one Come on, on the scales.
Oh, now, Ricky.
On the scales.
All right.
How much do I weigh?
Okay.
On behalf of our tubby trio I welcome you to our flabby foursome.
Well, now that that's over with.
What are we going to do tonight?
I don't know what you're going to do but I'm going out and kill myself.
Honey, so you gained a little weight.
Is that so terrible?
A little weight?
I walked into this room weighing 110.
I now weigh 132.
That's 22 pounds in ten minutes.
Aw, Lucy, don't cry about it.
What if I cried every time I gained a pound?
We'd be up to our ears in tears.
Never mind, Fred.
I'm nothing but a big, bloated bunch of blubber.
Oh, honey, now don't talk that way.
I wouldn't want you any different than you are just now.
You wouldn't?
No I like you plump.
I I didn't mean it like that.
I mean, you look swell!
I'm not worried about you, but how am I going to look on the stage?
The stage?
Yes.
Oh, no, you're not going to start that again, are you?
Oh, I know.
You don't want me in show business, but someday, in spite of you, opportunity will knock and what'll happen?
I'll be so big and fat I won't be able to get up and open the door.
Oh, honey, forget it.
You look wonderful.
Hello?
Hi, Jerry.
What?
Oh, this is a fine time.
What am I supposed to do- dance by myself?
Okay, okay.
Well, look, try to get some girls lined up and we'll have auditions in the morning.
Good-bye.
Oh, hello, Jerry?
Hello Listen, Jerry, what was the size of the new costume you just bought for Joanne?
Well, get girls that size.
Good-bye.
What's the matter, Ricky?
Joanne is quitting.
Who's Joanne?
Oh, that's terrible.
Who's Joanne?
At a time like this, too.
Who's Joanne?
Why did she quit?
Who's Joanne?
She's getting married.
Who's Joanne?
She's the girl that dances with Ricky.
Now, what was I doing wrong?
Now I got to find a girl who can sing and dance and teach her the number by Saturday night.
I can't think of a soul.
Lucy, will you stop that racket and let me think?
What are you so fidgety about?
Your girdle too tight?
No, I was just about to suggest that in this very room there's a very pretty and talented young lady who is a wonderful singer and dancer.
Who?
Ethel?
No, not her- me.
Oh.
Oh, Ricky, this is a wonderful chance for me.
I know the number.
I can take Joanne's place.
Please?
No, that's out of the question.
Give me one good reason.
Well, you're You're too fat.
Fat?
!
You said so yourself.
Plump maybe, but not fat.
Come on, Fred, we'd better go.
No, let's stay and see the fun.
Then you won't have to hang out the bathroom window to hear what they're saying.
Come on.
No, now you two stay right there.
I want you for witnesses.
Ricky Ricardo, I'm asking you to give me the same chance you would give anyone else.
Let me come down and audition for you just as if I were a stranger.
You can forget you ever knew me.
That's a very tempting offer.
Oh, can I audition for you, Ricky?
Can I?
All right, all right.
You can come down and audition in the morning.
Good!
Fred and Ethel, now, you heard that.
You're witnesses.
But it's gonna be strictly business.
I never saw you before in my life.
Okay, Lucy?
Lucy?
I beg your pardon.
Have we been introduced?
Pardon me, but is this where Ricky Ricardo is auditioning girls for the dance?
Yeah, honey, but if I had known he wanted older women, I'd have brought my mother.
Don't pay any attention to her, honey.
I guess we're all auditioning for the same part, huh?
Can I give you a tip?
Oh, yes.
I've known Ricky Ricardo for a long time.
Oh?
You're not his type.
Hi, Marco.
Hi, girls.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Good morning, Mr. Ricardo.
Now, let's all line up here, please.
Let's all line up.
We might as well get started.
Let's see what you can See what you can do.
We'll, uh we'll start with a time step.
All right, Marco, go ahead.
That's fine, that's fine.
That's enough for now.
That's enough for now.
That's fine.
All right, girls.
That's fine.
Now, um you're all size 12, aren't you?
Yes.
Uh yeah.
Well, that's good because whoever gets the job has to wear this size-12 costume.
Now, uh miss Uh?
MacGillicuddy.
Over here, please.
Yes, sir.
Now, take this costume into the dressing room and put it on, and then we'll see what you can do with the number.
Yes, sir, thank you.
All right.
Miss Macgoullucuddy, uh how are you coming along?
: Oh, I've almost got the costume on.
Well, hurry up.
We're waiting.
I'll be right there.
All I have to do is fasten it.
We're waiting.
Just this one last   Oh!
What happened?
It was a very small size 12.
Mira lo que lo hizo al vestido.
Mira lo que le paso el vestido.
Me dijo que tenia un size 12 y se lo puso, y lo rompio todo para que se puso el vestido si sabia que no iba a caber?
Gracias.
Now I got to get a new costume.
Oh, no, you don't, Mr. Ricardo.
It's only split in the seams.
I can sew it up myself.
Now, look, never mind.
Just take it off and leave it in the dressing room and don't call us, we'll call you.
Oh, but Mr. Ricardo What?
If I get thin enough to fit the dress, can I have the part?
Look, the number goes in by Saturday.
You couldn't possibly get thin enough by then.
But if I can, can I?
All right, all right.
Now, good-bye, good-bye.
You heard him, Ethel.
If I get thin enough to fit the dress, I can have the part.
Do you really think you can take off I'm going to get rid of this fat if I have to chop it off with a cleaver.
Hey, wait!
That was the last lap.
Oh, that's great.
You did that in 2Â½ minutes flat.
You now hold the national indoor record for the around-the- fourth-floor dash.
You've done good work.
You deserve a rest period.
Thanks.
Okay, time's up.
Now, you have time to jump this rope 500 times before the boys come home for dinner.
Two hundred?
One hundred?
Well, do as many as you can.
Uh one!
Uh two!
Uh higher!
Oh, you poor little thing.
You've worked very hard.
Let's weigh you in.
Come on.
Stiffen up, Lucy.
Another five ounces.
In three days, you've lost almost two pounds.
Keen.
Oh, don't get discouraged.
Only ten pounds more to go.
We'll get you into size 12.
Yeah, a size-12 shroud.
Now, take a shower and clean up.
I'll get dinner.
Dinner?
Okay.
What's the matter?
I can't seem to move.
Could you point me in the right direction?
Thanks.
Here you are, Ricky.
Oh, thank you.
Here you are, Fred, a nice juicy steak.
Oh, I love steak.
I hope you don't mind us bringing Butch along?
Not at all.
If he behaves himself, we'll give him the bone.
Oh, he's a good dog.
Best dog in the Here you are, Lucy.
Oh, no, that's yours.
How's your steak, Fred?
Perfect- just the way I like it.
Is your steak all right, Ricky?
Oh, delicious.
How's yours?
Fine, nice and tender.
Good.
How's your celery, Lucy?
Oh, delicious, thanks.
Is it cooked enough for you?
Oh, yes, just the way I like it, nice and tender.
Will you pass the potatoes, Rick?
Sure thing, here you go.
Thanks.
Oh, could I have a biscuit, Fred?
Sure, you can have a biscuit.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Want a biscuit, Ricky?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Hey, Fred, could I have the potatoes back, please?
Sure, you may.
Thank you, Fred.
You know, I'm forgetting about poor, old Butch.
Hey, yeah, don't forget about him.
I'm going to give him a nice, juicy piece of this steak.
Do you mind?
Go ahead.
Come on, Butch.
Sit up there, boy.
There you are.
Sit up now.
There you go.
You going to thank me?
Huh?
Well, I can't stand anymore.
I'll be back later.
Ah!
Stay out of the kitchen.
How about another biscuit, Ethel?
Uh-huh.
There you are.
Hey, Fred, string beans?
Sure, these are good for you.
Full of iron.
There you are, Ricky.
Thank you.
Hey, I didn't give Butch anything.
Here you are, Butch.
Aren't you going to thank me?
Nice Butch, nice Butch.
Who's under there?
Who's under the table?
Nobody here but us dogs.
Lucy.
Come out from under the table.
Now, what do you got to say for yourself?
Lucy.
All right, you don't have to get nasty about it, I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
I'm going down to the corner bakery and smell the bread.
Okay, Lucy, let's get started on our road work for the day.
What's that?
A human pressure cooker.
Where'd you get it?
I rented it.
You really are determined, aren't you?
Of course- I'm going to do that number with Ricky tonight.
Did you lose enough weight?
I've got five more pounds to lose and five hours to do it in.
This is my last day.
If you spend five hours in that it really will be your last day.
Well, it's my only chance, Ethel.
Okay, I only hope you know what you're doing.
I do.
Check me at 6:00 tonight.
You're not really going to spend all that time in there?
I certainly am.
All right.
They'll have to pick you up with a blotter.
Okay, honey, it's 6:00.
How are you doing?
Lucy!
Where are you?
Lucy!
Lucy.
Is this all that's left?
Practically.
Oh, Lucy, you gave me an awful fright.
Thank heavens you're here.
I'm here, all right.
You did it.
I'm going down to the club and do that number.
What about that other girl Ricky hired?
I'll take care of her somehow.
Do you really think you can make it?
Oh, don't worry.
I'm as strong as as a very weak horse but I'll make it.
They call me Cuban Pete I'm the king of the rumba beat When I play the maracas I go chick-chicky-boom, chick-chicky-boom Yes, sir, I'm Cuban Pete I'm the craze of my native street When I start to dance Everything goes chick-chicky- boom, chick-chicky-boom There's seÃ±oritas, they sing and how they swing With this rumbero It's very nice So full of spice And when they're dancing They bring a happy ring of vaqueros Singing a song all the day long So if you like the beat, take a lesson from Cuban Pete And I'll teach you to chick-chicky-boom Chick-chicky-boom, chick-chicky-boom Si, seÃ±orita, I know That you will like the chicky-boom-chick Because it's the dance of Latin romance And Cuban Pete doesn't teach you in a hurry Like Arthur Murray I come from Havana and there's always maÃ±ana.

Hey!
Hey!
Ricky?
Yes, Lucy?
Do I get to be in the show every night now, Ricky?
Well, I'm afraid not, honey.
You were wonderful, but the doctors say you got to stay in bed for three weeks.
You're suffering from malnutrition.
Ew
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hi, honey!
Look what I got.
Pretty good, eh?
"Held over!
Ricky Ricardo and his orchestra at the beautiful Tropicana.
" Yes, sir isn't that wonderful?
They want us to stay another four weeks.
If everything goes as well as it did tonight, we'll stay there a hundred years.
I took so many bows tonight that I got a charley horse in my hip.
Boy, they sure recognize talent when they see it.
Good night.
Oh My goodness, you scared me!
When did you sneak in here?
A couple of minutes ago.
Oh, I must have been so interested in my book.
Where did my book go?
Where is my book?
It went out the window.
Out the window?
I don't see it anywhere.
Of course not- it's dark out there.
Good night.
Ricky What?
One of us ought to get up and go down and get it.
One of us?
Yes.
Which one of us did you have in mind?
Oh, the one that's the biggest and the strongest.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Oh, Ricky.
Now, look, honey, I'm a husband, not a retriever.
Good night.
How can I go to sleep till I know who killed her?
Let's see it was either the upstairs maid or the butler or the cook.
It was her husband.
Her husband?
He didn't have any reason to kill her.
He was married, wasn't he?
Oh I can see it all now: He worked very hard all day.
Got home about 2:00 in the morning.
She started pestering him.
Wouldn't let him sleep.
He stood it as long as he could.
Finally, he decided to do away with her.
So he got out of bed looked around for a murder weapon.
A gun!
Nah make too much noise.
A knife!
Aha!
Too sloppy.
Aha!
A scarf.
Perfect.
It would do the job quietly and neatly.
Slowly he approaches the bed, murder in his heart.
And then   Good morning, Lucy.
I had the most exciting time last night.
I learned how What's that you're reading?
Lucy  Gosh, did I scare you?
No, no.
I was just getting ready to scream and throw my book out the window anyway.
I'm sorry.
Gee, no wonder they call it The Mockingbird Murder Mystery.
Every time I get that book in my hand, it flies out the window.
Oh, Lucy, forget that book.
I had the most exciting time last night.
I learned how to tell fortunes with playing cards.
Come on in, I'll tell your fortune.
Look, Ethel, we just rent this apartment from you.
It doesn't say anything in the lease about having to have our fortune told.
Besides, I don't believe in that silly stuff.
Oh, but this system never fails.
It's just fantastic the stuff we learned last night.
Well, maybe the cards will tell you where my book is.
Now, Lucy, you've got to be serious, or the cards won't tell you anything.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Okay serious.
Now, we have here Wait a minute, Ethel, what's wrong with these cards?
Oh, look, let's forget the fortune-telling.
You're right, there's nothing to it.
Yeah, I know there's nothing to it, but I want to know what it is there's nothing to.
Oh, but really, Lucy Why did you look like you did when you saw these cards?
No, Lucy, please.
Now, what does this grubby little group of cards have to say for itself?
Well this is your card.
The queen of hearts- that's you.
Yeah.
And this card right next to it is the ace of spades.
What does that mean?
Death.
Death!
Well, what's it doing so close to me?
That's just it.
When your card is next to the ace of spades, that means you're going to be dead.
Dead?
Like in "as a doornail"?
Oh, what's the matter with me?
I don't believe in fortune-telling.
I don't either.
Well, what are you laughing at?
I'm laughing at fortune-telling because it's so silly.
Do you know anyone who would like to kill you?
No.
Well, then, you can see Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Last night I thought Ricky was going to.
Ricky?
!
Yeah oh, but he was just kidding.
I think.
The phone.
Oh  Hello?
Oh, Ricky got it.
I'd better get him some coffee.
Hello, Ricky?
Yeah.
Who's this?
This is Jerry, your agent, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm way over in Jersey.
Listen, I signed up that dog act for you.
They're all set for next week.
Good, good.
Yeah, and now I got to go see a talking seal.
Talking seal?
Does he do an act?
No, no.
The seal is the manager.
He's got a couple of trained people.
You're daffy.
Hey, listen, I want to give you the dope on the dogs.
You have to get it to the publicity department this morning, or it'll never get out on time.
Okay, Jerry, wait a minute, will you?
All right.
Wait a minute.
Give me their names.
Oh, here's the dogs' names: Ann Ann.
Mary Mary.
Helen Helen.
Cynthia Cynthia.
Alice Alice.
and Theodore.
Theodore.
Yeah.
These are dogs?
Well, that's the way they want to be billed.
Oh, and listen, while I think of it, you know, your budget can't afford all those dogs and a girl singer.
Now, what are you going to do about Marilyn?
Oh, I didn't tell you, huh?
Well, I've been wondering what to do about her for a long time.
I finally made up my mind.
I'm going to get rid of her.
Yeah, she's been with me a long time, Jerry, and that's the trouble- she's been with me too long.
After all, the same face night after night gets pretty tiresome.
I'll I'll probably miss her some, but in a couple of weeks, I'll get another one and she'll be just as good.
Maybe even better.
Yeah, well, I guess you're right.
A girl singer isn't the most important thing in the world.
Oh, before I forget, did you pick up that trick gadget for the Western number?
The gun?
Yeah, I got it right here in my desk drawer.
Oh, that's a good deal.
Okay, then, I'll see you later, then.
Good-bye, Jerry.
Oh, hiya, honey.
Hi!
Hi.
Listen, I have to rush right down to the club, so I'll get breakfast down there.
Bye.
Good-bye.
Oh I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Bye.
Uh-oh, I forgot.
Ethel!
Ethel!
What's the matter?
You're looking at a future doornail.
Huh?
Ricky just tried to kill me.
Really?
Then I'm a better fortune-teller than I thought.
What am I saying?
What are you talking about?
I overheard him on the phone.
He's been planning this a long time, and he finally decided to do it.
Last night was just a dress rehearsal.
Oh, no, Lucy, you must have misunderstood him.
No, I didn't.
He took a shot at me already, but he missed.
Was that the noise I heard just now?
Yeah.
he bought a gun especially for it.
Let's see if it's in that desk.
Oh, you poor, poor thing.
What's that?
Ricky wrote something while he was talking on the phone and he blotted it on this blotter.
Where are you going?
Mirror.
Mirror?
Yeah.
Oh, so you can read it.
My, you're clever.
I don't read mystery books for nothing.
"Helen, Ann, Mary "  What's it mean?
I'm not even cold yet, and Ricky's lining up girls to take my place.
"Helen, Ann, Mary, Cynthia, Alice, Theodore.
" Theodore?
Oh!
It's you.
I thought it was Ricky.
Well, what are you going to do?
Just stay here and wait for him to shoot you?
Oh, I thought maybe I could talk to him, make him change his mind.
Are you crazy?
I still love him, Ethel.
Well, all I've got to say is, Lucy, you're awfully brave.
Oh, I'm not brave at all.
I'm scared to death.
Every time I think about it, I get a sinking feeling right here.
You get a sinking feeling where?
Here.
Here?
What's that?
Bulletproof vest.
And that's not all I bulletproofed.
That's in case he shoots me in the back.
I got it all figured out, Ethel.
I'm going to stand right up to him, and when he comes in that door, I'm going to say, "Okay, Ricky, okay.
What seems to be the trouble between us"?
What are you doing?
A moving target is harder to hit.
Lucy!
It's Ricky!
Where are you, Lucy?
Save me, save me!
Who's going to save me?
He won't shoot you, it's me he's after.
Yes, but to get to you, he's got to go through me.
Lucy!
Let me go.
Ethel, Ethel, you can't do this to me.
You're my best friend.
I know I'm your best friend.
That's why I can't stand to see you riddled with bullets.
But Ethel!
Ethel!
Ethel!
Oh, hello, honey, there you are.
What's the matter with you, you got an itch or something?
No, nothing's the matter with me.
What's new?
What's new?
!
I can't go on.
I give up.
Go ahead, shoot.
Shoot who?
Me.
Don't talk silly.
Oh, you're getting smart, huh?
Guns make noise, the neighbors might hear.
So you're going to strangle me.
I'm not going to shoot you, and I'm not going to strangle you.
Fortunately, I'm too big for the garbage disposal.
Lucy, for goodness' sakes Honey Lucy, what's the matter with you?
Nothing, and there isn't gonna be, either.
Honey!
Lucy!
Come out here, honey.
Come on, what's the matter with you?
Go away!
Open the door, honey!
Come on, honey, open the door!
Go away!
Open the door, honey!
Honey, please, open the door!
Come on, honey, come on, what's the matter with you?
Hey, Ricky, what's going on up here?
Oh, hello, Fred.
Ethel came running down to our place and told me to hurry up here right away.
What's the matter?
Don't ask me, Fred- Lucy's acting crazy.
Crazy for Lucy, or crazy for ordinary people?
Crazy for anybody.
She seems to have some idea that I'm going to kill her.
That doesn't mean anything.
Sooner or later every married woman decides that her husband wants to kill her.
She's usually right.
Look, Fred, please, this is no time for jokes.
She's really upset.
I've never seen her like this way before.
Look, I got to go to the club I got a big rehearsal over there.
I don't want to leave her alone here tonight.
There's only one thing you can do.
The same thing I do with Ethel when she gets upset.
What's that?
Slip her a Mickey.
A Mickey?
Well, not really a Mickey unfortunately.
Just a mild sedative.
Here, I've got one here- wait.
That's a stomach capsule.
Oh, there's that button I want sewed back on my pants.
Here here it is- here's the sedative.
Oh, great.
If she thinks I'm gonna kill her, you don't think she's she'll take this, do you?
Just drop that in a glass of soda water and she'll never know the difference.
Well, it's not a bad idea, but I don't know.
Now, that'll put her to sleep for the rest of the night.
You go on down to the club.
I'll look in from time to time and see that she's all right.
Well, thanks, amigo, I hope it works.
Don't you worry about a thing.
Lucy!
Yeah-yeah?
Come on, honey, have a drink.
Well, I I'm not really very thirsty.
Oh, come on, sweetheart, it'll do you good.
Come on, honey, come on.
Well, all right.
Let's dance.
Dance?
Yeah, I haven't danced in a long time.
Put your glass down here.
But honey, there's no music.
Oh, who needs music?
You dance divinely.
That's enough dancing, let's drink.
Look at that!
What?
That is the biggest spider I've ever seen.
Where?
Where?
I don't see anything.
Well, I gu I guess I was mistaken.
Oh.
Well, let's drink.
Salud.
Gesundheit.
No, wait!
What was that for?
I can't do it to you even though you would do it to me.
What are you talking about?
I switched glasses.
I know you did, I switched them back.
You mean you mean, I got the one with th-th-the You certainly did.
Ricky Ricky, come here, I want to talk to you.
Ricky, no matter what you've done, I forgive you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Gee, that's a powerful sleeping powder.
Sleeping powder, ha!
The sleep from which no one returns.
Oh, honey, come on, you'd better lie down.
Let me help you lie down.
Lie down, honey, lie down.
Don't rush me!
I'll be lying down for a long, long time.
Boy, that certainly did the trick.
Where's Ricky?
He's gone.
Are you all right, Lucy?
What happened?
I got a Mickey from Ricky.
This is it, Ethel.
You're just in time to say good-bye.
Good-bye, Lucy.
Good-bye.
How long do you think I've got?
Not long.
I've got time.
I've got to.
What are you going to do?
I'm going down to Ricky's club.
If I can't have him, nobody else can.
I'll come with you.
Get your coat.
I'm going to rub him out with the same gun he was going to use on me.
All right, Ricky!
Lucy!
Lucy, what are you doing?
You know what I'm doing.
Honey, don't make a scene.
Hector, they're wonderful, they're really great particularly Mary and Cynthia.
Mary and Cynthia?
Did you write their names down on the telephone pad?
Yes.
That's Ann, Helen, Mary, Cynthia, Alice and that's Theodore.
That's Theodore.
Then that really was a sleeping powder in my drink.
Certainly.
Well, then, what are you doing with that gun?
I was going to shoot you.
Oh, honey.
Hi, honey.
The opening was wonderful!
We were sensational.
Good night.
I hope this time you can't find it.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Good morning, Lucy.
Fortunately, I'm not the sensitive type.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ethel.
I'm so terribly busy.
You know what day this is, don't you?
What day is it?
This is the day Ricky goes over my household accounts.
Well, so long.
Oh, now, Ethel, don't go.
I need your moral support.
I don't think I'll ever get it figured out.
I know I'm a fool to ask this but what are you doing?
This is my system for paying bills.
See, I throw them all up in the air, and those that land face up are the winners.
By the winners, you mean the ones you pay?
Uh-huh.
Well, what happens if they all land face up?
Well, then I just switch.
I only pay the ones that land facedown.
That figures.
Oh, what's the use?
I can't afford to pay any bills this month.
Honey!
Yes, dear.
Are your books ready for me to see?
Yes.
Let me know how you come out.
All right.
Okay, let's see what shape your accounts are in this month.
I'm afraid Well, honey, if you're too busy this morning Oh, no, no, no, no.
I wouldn't miss this for all the money in the world.
And that's probably what it'll cost me.
Hmm hmm Is it interesting?
Very.
$245 for miscellaneous.
Miscellaneous?
Yeah, miscellaneous.
Would you mind telling me what comes under miscellaneous?
Oh, you know, rent, groceries, telephone, electric, gas- stuff like that.
Oh, that kind of miscellaneous.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm glad to see you paid this month's bills.
Well, they're not exactly this month's bills.
Oh?
They're last month's?
No, they're not last month's either.
You don't mean they're the month before last?
No, but you're getting warmer.
What month's bills are you paying now?
Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride Wait, wait, wait.
Morbid curiosity makes me want to see more.
The lights have not been paid.
The water hasn't been paid.
The phone hasn't been paid.
Why they haven't been turned off, I don't know.
Well, I've been going around stalling our creditors.
Huh?
I jollied them out of it.
Oh, you did.
Yeah, except that this month I'm afraid they're going to want more money and less jolly.
Lucy, this is absolutely fantastic.
It's just unbelievable.
I would like a logical explanation of it.
Well, I'd like a "lowgical splanation" of it, too.
I make good money.
I bring it home and it disappears.
Now, what have you been doing with it?
I sank it all in a phony gold mine.
That's very funny.
I thought you'd like it.
Yeah.
Well, I got something very funny to tell you, too.
Oh, you have?
Yes, I have.
You know, you've used up your allowance until next February.
And you're not going to get any more money until then.
But, Ricky And not only that, but you can't have any more charge accounts.
I will handle all the money and pay all the bills.
Now, isn't that funny?
But, Ricky, you can't do that to me.
Well, now, honey, I know that this seems very harsh to you right now, but we got to get our finances in order and teach you a lesson and this is the only way.
But, Ricky, you're so smart.
Can't you think of another way?
No!
Look, if you can get the bills paid we'll go back to the old arrangement.
Until then, it's got to be this way.
Now, come on, come on.
Give me a kiss.
Hmm, salty but nice.
See you later.
How'd it go?
Oh, just awful.
He did something he's never done before.
What?
He cut off my charge-a-plate.
No!
Yes, and it hurt, too.
Aw, you poor little thing.
Hey, I'm on my way to a radio show and I got two tickets.
Why don't you come go with me?
It'll take your mind off your troubles.
No.
Oh, come on, it's the Freddie Filmore Show.
You know, the one called Females Are Fabulous.
I just came from a show called "Husbands Are Horrible.
" Come on, put your coat on.
No, if there's one thing I don't feel like doing today, it's going to a radio show.
But you might win a prize.
Well, you go ahead, Ethel.
The first prize is a thousand dollars.
Well, what would I do with a thousand dol A thousand dollars?
!
Uh-huh.
Well, come on, what are we waiting for?
Well!
Females are Fabulous.
Welcome to another session of Females Are Fabulous, our very outstanding program based on the theory that any woman is willing to make an idiot out of herself in order to win a prize.
Now, our first contestant today, a lovely little lady who's going to try for our thousand dollar jackpot, Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Come on out here, Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, we're going to have a lot of fun aren't we, Mrs. Ricardo?
Yeah.
Tell me, how would you like to go to the beach this afternoon?
Oh, I'd like that.
You'd like that.
Well, of course, we can't go to the beach so we're going to do the next best thing: we're going to bring the beach to you.
Bring the beach in here, fellows.
Come on, get it right in here.
That's it, set it right down there.
Oh, isn't that a beautiful beach?
Come on, right onto the beach.
That's it, Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, look at that sand.
Isn't that beautiful?
Hey, why don't you take off your shoes so you can wiggle your toes in the sand?
Don't you always do that when you're down at the beach?
Yes.
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?
Get it on her, boys, get it on her.
That's it.
Oh, say, isn't that beautiful?
I tell you, that really does something for you.
Long bathing suit.
: Yes, sir.
Oh, and then, too, we've got a beach umbrella here.
You know, we wouldn't want you to get sunburned.
The sun's awfully bright down here at the beach and we do want you to feel Oh, that's real fetching, that is.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, that really does something for you.
You all ready for our little game now?
Well, I'll tell you what we want you to do.
You know the song "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean"?
Uh, yeah.
You do?
Lovely little song, isn't it?
Yeah.
Well, what we want you to do is sing that song, and every time you mention something that has to do with water we're going to do our best to make you feel that you're right down at the beach.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Okay, you go ahead.
My My bonnie lies over the ocean My bonnie lies over the sea My bonnie lies over the ocean Oh, bring back my bonnie to me.
Oh, no, now that time, you see, I didn't squirt you because the last line had nothing to do with water.
Now, do you get the idea of our little game?
Yes, I see.
Sea!
Listen, I've got a notion An ocean!
Oh, that was wonderful, Mrs. Ricardo.
Yes, sir.
How about giving her a big hand, folks?
Oh, naughty, naughty, naughty, Mrs. Ricardo.
Well, where's my thousand dollars?
Oh, no, no, you don't get the thousand dollars for this.
This was just a little test to see if you qualify for the thousand dollars.
And she does qualify, doesn't she, audience?
Yes, sir.
Now, in just a minute, I'm going to tell you the simple little thing you have to do in order to actually win the thousand dollars.
But first we want to present a check for a thousand dollars to the winner of last week's jackpot, Mrs. Peterson.
Come right on in here, Mrs. Peterson.
Well, now, Mrs. Peterson, it wasn't so tough going over Niagara Falls in a barrel, was it?
Well, here's your check.
She seems to be a little shaken up.
Yeah, well, I'll be seeing you.
Oh, no, no, Mrs. Ricardo, now you stay right here.
This next little stunt is very simple.
It is?
Oh, yes, yes.
I take it you're married?
Yes.
Never been married before?
No.
You've never been married before.
Well, now, I'll tell you what's going to happen.
We're going to send a man out to your house and you introduce him to your husband.
Where's the catch?
Catch?
The gimmick.
Oh, I did forget one simple little thing, yes sirree.
You're to introduce this man to your husband as your long-lost first husband.
My long-lost first what?
You don't seem to get the picture.
Now, look, you're sitting at home at this man comes and knocks on the door.
You open the door, you greet him with tears in your eyes, you pull him into the room and you introduce him to your present husband as your first husband whom you thought had disappeared.
But what will my husband say?
That's what we want to know, isn't it, audience?
Yes, sir, now, Mrs. Ricardo if you can keep up this little masquerade until midnight tonight, our man is going to give you this $1,000.
$1,000?
How about it?
How about letting me go over Niagara Falls in a paper bag?
Ah, no.
Now, you have exactly three seconds to make up your mind.
One two three!
I'll do it!
I knew you would because I always say "Females Are Fabulous"!
Give her a big hand, folks!
Come on!
Well, that takes care of everything on today's program except Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Here's her address.
Now, let me get this straight.
I show up there at 8:00 tonight, And she'll introduce me as her first husband.
That's right.
Now, here's the thousand dollars.
She keeps up the pretense until midnight you give her the money.
Got it.
Good luck.
I'll need it.
What a way to make a living.
I'll get it.
Get what?
Somebody knocked.
I was trying to make the lighter work.
Oh.
Why, are you expecting someone?
Who, me?
Who would I be expecting at this time of night?
Lucy, you seem awfully nervous tonight.
Me, nervous?
Why, I was never calmer in my life.
Thank you.
Are you sure there's nothing wrong?
No, of course not, dear.
I'll get it.
Hello?
No, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
Lucy, I never seen you act so jittery.
Are you sure everything's all right?
Of course, dear.
Well, why don't you do something?
Yeah, I'll do something.
You haven't finished those You haven't finished those socks for me yet.
Oh.
Why don't you knit for a while?
Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.
Yes?
Madame, can you spare a bit of sustenance for a deserving human who has met with a terrible accident?
No!
Any odd jobs for an honest, able-bodied man?
No, and we don't allow bums in this building.
Bums!
I think it only fair to warn you, Madame, that you are laying yourself open for a libel suit.
You get out of here, you good-for-nothing tramp, or I'll call the police.
Aha!
I thought you'd change your tune.
Change my tune Well, it'll do you no good.
I'm leaving.
Not up there.
The street's that way.
What deplorable manners.
Lucy.
What?
!
I just want to know how you're coming along with my socks.
Oh, just fine, dear.
I'm almost finished, see?
I guess I got carried away.
I'll get it.
Ah, good evening.
I wonder Darling, after all these years you've come back.
I have?
Yes, it's so good to see you.
Well, it's good to see you, too.
I, um I beg your pardon.
Oh, no, don't go.
I want you to meet Ricky.
Ricky, I don't know exactly how to say this, but I want you to meet my first husband.
How do you Your first what?
Husband.
Husband?
What kind of Now, Ricky, Ricky, don't get excited.
Let's all sit down and talk about this calmly.
Yes, let's all sit down.
Sit down, Ricky.
I don't feel like sitting down.
Now, listen, you, what kind of a gag is this?
Well, it's really nothing, dear.
Nothing?
Well, it's just that a long time ago- before I met you- I was friends with You were not friends.
You were married.
Yeah, just a little bit.
A little bit?
Well, all right, I was married to Harold.
Sam.
Sam.
Harold.
All right, all right, so you were married to Harold, Sam, Julius or whichever his name is.
Julius!
?
You stay out of this.
How long were you married?
Well, it was just a matter of weeks.
Really, it's not worth talking about, Ricky.
Not worth talking about?
Ha!
Well, we were married for a very short time and then Harold had to join the service and then I learned he was missing in action.
Aw oh, oh!
It was for the battle of the Argonne Woods.
The Kaiser's troops were all about us, and Blackjack Sherman Pershing put his hand on my shoulder and said to me, "Sam"- he always called me by my nickname- "Sam," he said, "gather about you " Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look, the battle of the Argonne Woods was in the first world war.
Yes That was 33 years ago.
How old were you when you got married?
I- I was very young.
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, how old are you now?
What do you think, I'm a dope or something?
You couldn't possibly be 65.
I couldn't?
Of course not, look at you.
Don't you care what he says, dollface you still look good to me.
A tu te calla la boca y no le digas a mi seÃ±ora "dollface".
Ricky, Ricky, now don't get excited.
I was married to Harold, and that's all there is to it.
Well, that's true- I know it must come as a horrible and surprising disclosure but the children are entitled to their true father.
The children?
Yes, my little darlings.
Where are they?
Don't you have them?
You've misplaced them again.
You always were forgetful, weren't you, uh, uh?
What's her name?
Well, I always called her Red.
Now, Ricky.
You stay out of this.
What's her name?
Ricky.
Lucy, I told you Ah the forgetful little Lucy.
How well I remember the first time I heard that lilting name.
It seems like yesterday.
In fact, it seems like today.
Now, look, am I going crazy or something?
Neither one of you is telling the truth.
Now, why would you want me to think that she's married to you in the first place?
Well, uh Lucy, I want the truth.
The truth?
Yes, were you or were you not married to him?
Yes.
Well, that does it, I'm packing.
Packing?
Of course.
If we are not married, you can't expect me to stay here.
Besides, you want to be alone with your husband.
But, Ricky  Psst!
Did that man from the program get here?
Yeah, he's here.
I don't want to take up any of your time.
I just wanted to find how you were making out.
Okay.
Can I take a peek at him?
Yeah, go ahead.
What's that bum doing in there?
What bum?
That tramp- he was down at my door not ten minutes ago asking for a handout.
He's not the man from the program.
Oh!
Take your hand out of that drawer.
The honeymoon is over.
What do you mean going on up those stairs when I told you the street was the other way?
Good-bye, Lucy.
Good-bye, Ricky.
Wait a minute, come back here.
Now, now, now, I resent this intrusion upon my person.
Those are my life's savings you're taking from me.
On your way.
There is no need seeing me to the door.
Mother told me to expect days like this.
Get out!
The nerve of some bums.
Now, Mrs. Ricardo, if you don't mind, I think that I am entitled to a little bit of an explanation of what is going on here!
Oh!
Uh Oh, Ethel, would you excuse us?
I have a little explaining to do to Ricky.
You sure have, dear.
Good night.
Now, now, Ricky, sit down, dear.
Sit down.
Wait till you hear.
It's so funny and it's so simple.
Well, what is it?
Well, you know this morning when we had that discussion about money.
Well, Ethel and I  Oh, I'll get it.
No, no- I'll get it.
Is this the Ricardo residence?
Yes.
Darling, don't you recognize me?
It's Arnold.
Well?
Ricky, I want you to meet my second first husband.
Now, Ricky, listen to me.
Please listen to me.
That's what they asked me to do at the radio program in order to win that thousand dollars, and I came home and I tried to do it, and I don't know who that first man was but I was never married to him and this is the man from the program and he's my real first husband but I was never married to him either and that's the truth, so help me.
Now, if you don't believe me, you can leave.
That is the most ridiculous story I've ever heard in my whole life.
But it's true, Mr. Ricardo, and your wife didn't start explaining until after midnight, so she wins the thousand dollars.
Congratulations, Mrs. Ricardo, and thanks for a very pleasant evening.
Thank you.
Good night.
You give me that, Ricky Ricardo.
That belongs to me.
Let's see.
Rent, $250 grocer, $100 charge account, $575 utilities, $74.50.
Well, you got some change coming.
Well, I should hope so.
There you are.
Ricky!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Ricky, time to get up!
Ricky, time to get up.
Aw, come on, now, honey.
You said you had an appointment at and it's after 10:00.
All right, you asked for it.
iBabalu!
iBabalu-aye!
All right, all right, all right, all right!
All right, I'll get up.
All right.
Ricky!
Yeah?
Did you find out when you're going to do your TV audition?
No, I didn't.
You did, too.
I did not.
It's any day now.
They're going to tell me whenever they're ready.
You know, I've been thinking about shows like Burns and Allen.
George Burns uses his wife on the show.
Why don't you?
I'd love to.
You think she would leave George?
Oh Well, I know one thing- you'll never be a success on television.
And what do you mean by that, pray tell?
Because you don't have a pretty girl in your act, that's why.
: Here we go again.
I'll get along.
Everybody knows that you have to have a pretty girl in your act to demonstrate the sponsor's product.
Really?
Sure.
She eats it or drinks it or waxes the floor with it or cuts potatoes with it or drives off in it.
Or smokes it.
So?
So how would you like to have your sponsor's product demonstrated by a gorgeous redhead?
I'd love it.
Oh, you would?
You know where I can find one?
Oh!
Ay-ay-ay!
Now what are you doing?
I'm looking for my ear.
Oh You didn't really lose an ear.
Eh?
How's that?
Oh, stop it.
Honey, you know how I feel about this.
I don't want my wife in show business.
Why not?
Oh, Lucy, we've been over this I want a wife who's just a wife.
Now, all you have to do is clean the house for me, bring me my slippers when I come home at night, cook for me and be the mama for my children.
You never wear your slippers.
It doesn't matter.
Just do the others.
You're missing a good bet.
Huh?
I say, you're missing a good bet.
Am I?
Yeah.
How you figure?
Because I can sing.
Oh?
And dance.
What else?
And tell jokes.
How about it?
No.
No?
No.
Oh, you have no imagination.
I'll bet if Ziegfeld or Earl Carroll had seen me, they'd sign me up like that.
As what?
As a beautiful show girl.
Go answer the door.
Oh!
Oh.
Hey, Rick, have I got news for you!
Tonight's the night.
Your audition's tonight.
Shh!
I don't want Lucy to hear.
Oh.
Oh, well, the network big shots are coming down to the club tonight to audition your show for TV.
How do you know?
Well, read this telegram.
I opened it by mistake.
Oh, here's some mail for you.
"Dear Mr. Ricardo, we're coming down to the Tropicana to catch your show tonight.
" Oh, Fred, that's wonderful!
For goodness' sakes, don't tell Lucy, will you?
If she knows the audition is tonight she'll be pestering the life out of me trying to get into the act.
How am I going to get rid of her for the day?
Well, you could lock her in the bathroom.
If she stays in there as long as Ethel does she'd never even know the door's locked.
No, Fred, I can't do that.
Let's see what we got in here.
Boy, what is this?
What is all that stuff?
Oh, it's our wills.
The attorney wants us to sign them.
Wills?
Oh, that's a happy thought.
Listen, if my show is not a success tonight, I'm going to need them.
Well, I wish I could help you.
I wish you could figure a way to get rid of Lucy.
Yeah?
Hey, I know.
I'll have her take these things down to the attorney.
His office is way downtown.
Well, that ought to do it.
Now-Now-Now, listen, can I come and hear the rehearsal tonight?
Sure.
Remember now- tonight's the night.
Knock 'em dead!
Shh!
Da, da, da, da, da, da Da-da, da-da-da-da Da-da-da-da  Lucy Yes?
No.
Oh, Ricky!
Don't you want to know who was at the door?
Who was it?
Your agent?
Does he know when the TV audition is?
What'd he say?
What'd he say?
No, it wasn't my agent; it was the mailman.
Oh.
He brought some papers for us to sign and we got to take them down to the attorney's.
It's my will.
Well, I'll get your breakfast.
Your will?
!
Yes.
What's the matter, Ricky?
Nothing is the matter.
There is, too.
You're keeping something from me.
You're sick!
I never felt better in my whole life.
Then you lied to me when we were married.
You're really older than I think.
Now, look, honey, it's just good business.
The lawyer says I should have a will.
Then everything is legally taken care of if anything happens.
I won't discuss it.
Oh, look, honey, you have to know how things are arranged so you know what to do when I, uh when I go.
Oh, all right, Ricky.
That's better.
Now what's the matter?
Oh, Ricky, I miss you so.
For goodness' sakes, Lucy I haven't gone yet.
Don't go, Ricky, don't go.
Now, look, honey, I'm perfectly well.
I feel fine.
But let's face it.
We all have to go sometime.
We do?
We do, unless you know something the rest of us don't.
No, I "dunt.
" I'll get your breakfast.
All right, honey.
He brought your will along, too.
My will?
Yeah.
What for?
You're the one that's going.
Now, Lucy What are you trying to do- shove me ahead of you in line?
Now, look, honey, this isn't my idea- it's lawyer's.
We got to get them signed, and you got to take them down to the attorney's today.
Impossible.
I have an appointment to have my hair dyed- washed.
They got to go today.
Now, come on.
Oh, Ricky, the attorney's way downtown.
It'll take me all day.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, can't they wait?
Absolutely not.
Well, why not?
Well Well, suppose you didn't take them down till tomorrow.
Yes?
And we both got killed today.
Yes?
How could you take them down tomorrow?
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Ole, ole, ole, ole  Ole, ole, ole, ole Ah, ah, ah, ah All right, all right, fellows.
That's pretty bad, you know.
If you're going to sing, don't go: Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Let's go: Ah, ah, ah, ah!
Let's put some pep into the thing.
What's the use of having a rehearsal if we're not going to do it right?
Buffo, aren't you ready yet?
I'm ready.
Go ahead with my music.
All right, give me the clown music, fellows.
All right, wait, wait, wait a minute.
Listen, aren't you going to do the cello bit first?
No, I'm going to do the handstand on the handlebars.
Oh, okay.
Buffo!
What happened there?
Hey, buffo!
What happened, kid?
The brakes locked.
The brakes locked?
Oh, my goodness.
Sit down here.
Are you all right?
I don't know.
He ought to lie down for a little while.
I'd better go home.
And I'll go with him.
Where do you live?
Staten island.
Look, you don't have to take him all the way home.
Why don't you take him to my apartment, Fred.
There's nobody there.
All right, come on, Buffo.
I'd better get the bicycle.
I want to see if it's all right.
Never mind the bike.
I'll mind that.
You take care of yourself.
Don't worry about tonight.
I'll be okay.
All right, give me seventh in the books.
Everybody on the downbeat.
Ay-ay-ay!
What kind of a start is that, fellows?
It's me- Buffo.
It's Buffo!
Buffo, you scared me to death.
What are you doing here?
I got hurt at rehearsal this afternoon, and Ricky said I could come over here and lie down for a while.
Oh what rehearsal?
Are they getting ready for that TV audition?
Sure, the show's tonight.
Tonight?
Why, that big bum.
So that's why he sent me on a wild goose chase- just to get rid of me.
Well, are you all right, Buffo?
Will you be able to do the show tonight?
Well, I guess I can, if the bicycle works.
The brakes locked.
Oh.
I'll take a look at it.
Oh, you got it here.
Yeah.
How is it?
Seems all right.
Wait till I try it, huh?
Oh!
Oh!
Here.
Buffo, are you badly hurt?
Oh, you'd better tell Ricky to get somebody else.
But who?
I don't care.
Why don't you take my place?
Me?
Oh, don't be ridic Yo quiero pedir que mi negra me quiera Que tenga dinero y que no se muera Yo le quiero pedir A babalu Una alegra mona como tu Que no tenga otro negro para que no se muera.

No sign of him anywhere.
Oh, that's a fine thing.
Look at that, the sponsors are here.
What am I going to do?
They don't look too happy.
Are you kidding?
For them, that's hilarious.
Well, I'll just have to wrap up the show.
That's all I can do.
Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you very much for being such a wonderful audience but we'll have to conclude the show because Have you seen a fellow named "Risky Riscardo"?

Oh, I was only trying to help- honest.
I never dreamed they'd offer me a contract.
What are you going to do about it?
What do you want me to do, Ricky?
You know what I want.
I just want you to clean the house Oh, I've been doing that ever since I got home.
And hand me my slippers when I come home at night And cook for you and be the mama for your children.
Let's see you pull that out of your pocket.
Well, Ricky, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I have a surprise for you.
You do?
Yes- something that should make you very happy.
Lucy, you mean Yes, darling.
Oh, gosh.
I baked your favorite pie.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Good morning, dear.
Uh, what cooks with the breakfast?
Yes, dear.
Oh, breakfast, yeah.
Oh, oh.
What's so interesting?
Numerology, it's just fascinating.
Oh, no, what happened to reading palms tea leaves and horoscopes?
Nothing, only this is so much better than any of them.
Oh, it's a lot of nonsense.
It is not.
Now you read that book and see for yourself, Five.
Five?
Yeah, that's your name in numerology- I figured it out.
Oh, no.
Drink your two before it gets cold.
Now, wait a minute, before this thing gets out of hand I think I better nip it in the three.
Watch your language!
Now look, honey, you're a grown woman and this is the 20th century.
Why don't you forget all these superstitions and crazy ideas?
They are not crazy ideas.
For all you know, Ricky Ricardo, you might be going through life with the wrong name.
Hey, I better figure out the right one for you.
Maybe if you're something besides five, it'll help our vibrations.
Lucy.
What?
Don't you like the way I vibrate?
Oh, now you be quiet and let me figure this out.
Let's see now, two and three are five and "C" is six.
Now we need four and "O" is two.
There you are.
That's the perfect name.
Uh-oh.
What is it?
Genevieve.
That'd be interesting.
Of course, you'll have to buy towels marked "hers" and "hers.
" Look, I got a wonderful idea.
Why don't you just call me Ricky Ricardo and forget all the numerology nonsense?
Uh-oh, you dropped some silverware.
That means company is coming.
And it's a fork.
That means it's going to be a woman.
Oh, and my palm itches.
You know what that means, don't you?
The woman is wearing woolen underwear?
No.
You didn't take a shower this morning?
No, it means I'm going to get some money.
Ha!
Now, you just watch- a woman is going to come to the door today and give me some money.
I tell you what, my witch doctor friend- I'll make a deal with you.
What?
If a woman comes to the house and gives you some money I will give you ten bucks.
Oh, you're a doll.
Thank you.
But Oh, but.
Yes, but if this loaded female does not appear, eh?
You will forget all about these horoscopes, numerology and superstition and all the rest of the nonsense, all right?
It's a deal.
It's a deal.
Good morning, Lucy.
She's a woman.
I guess so.
Well, thanks.
Now that that's settled, how are you, Three?
I'm fine, Seven.
Oh.
Five got out on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
Here's the mail.
Mr. Six just brought it.
Oh, thank you.
And here's the dollar I borrowed from you yesterday.
Thank you.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
I better leave for rehearsal before I lose my sanity.
Good-bye, Three.
Good-bye, Five.
Why do you have that idiotic smile on your face?
I was just thinking of a perfect 16 I used to know.
Oh, get out of here.
Hey, by the way, my barber is going to call this morning to see if I can make it this afternoon for a haircut.
Tell him yes.
Oh, wait a minute now, wait a minute.
I want to look up your horoscope.
This might not be a good day for you to have a haircut.
Good-bye, Lucy.
Wait a minute, here it is- Gemini, Gemini.
"This is your big day.
Everything you do today will turn out well.
" Okay, Ricky, it's all right for you to get a haircut.
Well, I don't know.
I'm worried.
About what?
You'd better look up the barber and see if it's a good day for him to give me a haircut.
Oh Now you go on.
You feel free to say yes to everything today no matter what it is.
Oh, boy, will I!
Let's see what my horoscope is.
What are you, Ethel?
I'm Leo.
And the old lion sure is in a rut.
It says exactly the same thing it said yesterday.
Really?
Yeah.
Matter of fact, this is yesterday's paper.
What?
Mm-hmm.
See?
Oh, no, and I told Ricky to say yes to everything today and this may be his "no" day.
What did I do with today's paper?
Oh, no.
Oh.
I got to find that horoscope.
Here it is- Gemini, Gemini, Gemini.
What does it say?
"This is not your day.
"Danger lurks everywhere.
"Climb in a hole and pull the hole in after you.
Don't agree to anything.
" Oh, my goodness.
Oh, poor Ricky.
Out with a "yes" on his lips on a "no" day.
He shouldn't even go to the barber.
He might lose an ear or something.
That must be the barber.
Hello.
No, the answer is no.
Look, Ricky told me you were going to call and the answer is no- N-O.
See here, what is your name?
Merriweather?
Well, listen, Merriweather, I'm going to recommend to Mr. Ricardo that he have nothing more to do with you.
One of his sideburns is always higher than the other anyway.
Good-bye.
That takes care of Merriweather.
You sure saved Ricky from that.
I better call him at the club and tell him to come home and hide.
I got to go.
So long, Three.
Good-bye, Seven.
Lucy!
Oh, honey, am I glad you came back!
I was reading the wrong newspaper.
This is one of your bad, bad days of all time.
You can't talk to anybody or transact any business.
You better get in bed and pull the covers over your head.
I think I'm reasonably safe sitting here.
Well, honey, I don't know.
Did anybody call?
Just the barber- I told him no.
Nobody else?
No.
Well, good.
I came back because I remember I'm expecting a very important phone call here this morning.
What about?
I don't want to talk about it.
It's bad luck to talk about a big deal before it's set.
Just keep your fingers crossed.
Well, if it's that big, I'll do better than that.
Aren't you overdoing it a little?
I'm not finished yet.
Well, that should keep the bad spirits away.
Now, go in the kitchen and do your dishes and don't think about it anymore.
The call should come through any minute.
Well, I'm not gonna uncross anything.
You sure nobody called?
Just the barber.
Well, that's good, because I want to make sure to talk to Mr. Merriweather personally.
What's the matter?
Ricky, what's your barber's name?
Nick.
Nick what?
Vascalupas.
Just as a matter of idle curiosity who's Mr. Merriweather?
Well, I guess there's no harm in telling you.
He's one of the biggest theatrical producers in town and he's going to call me here this morning and offer me a job in one of his next shows.
Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, yeah, wonderful.
Ah, honey, if this thing comes through, all our worries are over.
You can have anything that you ever dreamed about.
I'm going to buy you the biggest diamond ring in town.
Diamond ring?
Yes, and I'm going to buy you a full-length mink coat.
A mink coat?
And the longest, shiniest Cadillac in the whole world.
Lucy, is there something wrong?
Oh, Ricky, I've done a terrible thing.
But before I tell you, is there any chance that Vascalupas has changed his name to Merriweather?
Lucy Lucy?
What have you done?
Lucy, what have you done?
Stand still and I'll tell you.
Well?
Well, Mr. Merriweather called and I thought it was the barber and I told him no.
What?
!
I was only trying to help!
Help?
!
Help!
I'll call him and explain.
You'll do better than that.
You're going to go down there in person on your knees.
Come on.
Oh, won't we get there faster if we take a cab?
Come on.
Tillie.
Tillie, if you can hear me, answer on the Ouija board.
Yes?
Oh, send them in.
Hello, Mr. Ricardo.
Hello, Mr. Merriweather.
This is my wife, Lucy.
She has something to tell you.
Oh, how charming.
Mr. Merriweather, it was a big mistake saying no to you today.
You see, I thought Oh, wait, please, please.
I can't discuss any more business today.
It's after 12:00.
After 12:00?
Yes, my horoscope says no more business after noon today.
Oh, you follow horoscopes?
Yes.
I'm Scorpio.
Oh, I'm Taurus.
I'm cooked.
Well, won't you, won't you sit down?
Yes.
You see, you see, Mr. Merriweather, the reason that I said no was because Ricky's horoscope said that it was a very bad day for him to accept anything.
Oh, yes, I understand perfectly.
Well, Mr. Merriweather, if you understand, maybe we could discuss about Oh, Ricky, if the stars say that he can't discuss business, that means he can't discuss it.
Now, you see, important people like Mr. Merriweather are interested in horoscopes, numerology and all of that.
Oh, you study numerology?
Of course.
I'm a one.
I'm a three.
I'm a five.
We're all odd, aren't we?
Do you Ouija?
How's that?
Do you Ouija?
Well, I'm not sure.
I mean, have you had any success with the Ouija board?
Oh, Ouija board!
Oh, no, I haven't gotten around to that yet.
Oh, too bad- I've worn out three of them trying to contact my dear, departed Tillie who left me three years ago.
Oh, I understand.
I wish I could find a good sÃ©ance.
You wouldn't happen to know where they're having one Mrs. Ricardo, would you?
Well, now, it just happens that we're having a sÃ©ance at our house tonight.
We are?
Oh, we are, we are.
And we'd love to have you come.
We just happen to have a vacant chair.
Oh, I just can't wait.
Who knows?
I may even get to talk to Tillie tonight.
Lucy, this is just plain silly.
If Mr. Merriweather finds out that we're doing this just for him, he'll never give me a job.
Oh, honey, he won't find out.
Now, Ethel will be the medium and you and I and Fred will just it here hold hands.
Well, what good would that do?
Well, now, you never can tell.
Before the evening is over, we may see a spook.
Don't tell me you invited your mother.
Well!
Introducing Rhea, the medium.
Well done, medium Rhea.
Ethel, you look sensational.
That's a wonderful getup.
Isn't it?
Fred, what are you doing with this?
It's not a Shriners' convention, you know.
Come on, Fred, help me get some ice.
All right.
Oh, bring the bucket, will you?
Ethel, I want to tell you something before the boys come back.
What?
I have a feeling we're going to contact the other side tonight.
Yeah?
What makes you think so?
Shake hands with Tillie Merriweather.
Huh?
Ricky will kill me if he knows what I'm planning, but after everybody gets seated, I'm going to sneak away from the circle and I'm going to be the voice of Tillie.
Where will you be?
Well, I'll be right over there behind you, near the fireplace.
Help me with the chairs.
Listen, Fred, Lucy will kill me for even thinking about this, but as long as we're going to go through with the sÃ©ance, Mr. Merriweather might as well really contact his wife.
Yeah.
Now, would you care to help me, Mrs. Merriweather?
I think you've snapped your twig, son.
Now look, Fred, it's very simple.
All you have to do is pretend that you have a headache and that you want to go downstairs to bed, see?
Then, as soon as the sÃ©ance gets going, I'll stamp my foot twice, you sneak up, and pretend to be the voice of Mrs. Merriweather.
Now, do you think you can sound like a female spirit?
: Well, I don't know, but I can certainly try, dear old boy.
Good girl.
I mean, uh I meant, good boy.
Now listen, Fred, don't be too obvious about the headache.
We don't want them to suspect anything.
Don't ham it up.
Fred, is something wrong?
It's my head.
Oh.
Aren't we going to have fun at this sÃ©ance?
Well, I guess so.
You look seriously ill to me.
Oh, if it's his head, he's all right.
There's nothing up there to hurt.
Why, you cruel, heartless woman.
Speaking to a sick man like this without any sympathy.
Fred, you better go to bed downstairs.
Go to bed, Fred.
Oh, good evening, Mr. Merriweather, come in.
Hello, Mrs. Ricardo.
Good evening.
Oh, good evening, Mr. Merriweather.
I'll take your coat and hat.
Thank you.
Mr. Merriweather, I'd like to present Madame Ethel Mertzola.
She's going to be our medium tonight.
She's psychopathic.
How do you do?
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, I've been thinking about this all afternoon.
You know, I have a feeling that tonight I'm going to contact Tillie.
So have I. Well, is everybody ready?
Yes, I feel real trancey.
Good.
Uh, you sit here, Mr. Merriweather.
Ricky, you're over there, dear.
All right.
I'll turn out the lights.
Okay, I'll move this one over here.
All right, Madame.
Now, everybody join hands.
Now everybody close their eyes and keep them tightly closed.
The spirits must not see the whites of your eyes.
Close your eyes and concentrate.
Oh, excuse me.
God bless you.
Oh, thank you.
I am now going into a trance.
I shall try to contact Tillie.
The next voice you hear will be the voice of Tillie.
Oh.
What's the matter?
Um, my foot was asleep.
Oh.
Is everyone comfortable now?
I'm comfortable.
Are you, Ricky?
Yes, I am.
How about you, Lucy?
Yes, I'm comfortable.
All right, here we go.
I shall now contact Tillie.
Ethel to Tillie.
Come in, Tillie, over.
Tillie.
Tillie, is that you?
: Yes, it's me, Tillie.
But Tillie, that sneeze, are you sick?
: Sick?
I'm dead.
Oh, that's right.
But wait, if you're a spirit, how can you have a cold?
: I went out last night without my shroud.
Oh.
Ow!
What's the matter?
Oh, I burned myself.
It's awfully hot here.
Oh, that's where you are!
Oh, Tillie, I'm so disappointed in you.
Oh, well, I have to go now.
Oh, no, no, no!
No, wait, Tillie, wait.
Tillie, I've always wanted to ask you something.
What?
Tell me, Tillie- who did you like the best, me or Mrs. Merriweather?
Huh?
I said, who did you like the best, me or Mrs. Merriweather?
Well, you, of course.
Oh, this is the most exciting day in my life.
Tillie liked me the best.
Oh, now Now, if if I may, I'd like to try and contact Mrs. Merriweather.
Mrs. Merriweather?
Well, all right.
Ethel to Mrs. Merriweather.
Ethel to Mrs. Merriweather.
Come in, Mrs. Merriweather.
Over.
FRED : Hello!
Is is that you, my dear?
Yes, darling.
Darling?
That doesn't sound like Adelaide.
Shut up, you worm!
That's Adelaide!
Oh, what terrible memories it brings back to me.
Uh, my trance is wearing off.
I think you'd better hang up now.
All right, good-bye, Adelaide.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Tillie.
LUCY : Good-bye.
Well, everybody unclasp hands now.
Open your eyes.
Well, this has certainly been an eventful evening.
Yes.
Well, I must dash home immediately and write it in my diary.
I'll get your coat, sir.
Thank you.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, I just can't thank you enough.
Well, it's been a pleasure.
Good night, Madame Mertzola.
Oh, good night.
I'll walk you downstairs.
Oh, Lucy, you were great.
I'd never have known you did those two voices.
I didn't.
You didn't?
No.
Ethel, you underestimate your transmitter.
You really contacted the other side.
I did?
Yes.
Oh, Lucy, I'm frightened.
So am I. Hello, Fred.
Hello.
Yippee!
Honey you got the best horoscopes in town.
Well, thank you.
You know what he did?
What?
Mr. Merriweather gave me an even better job.
He's going to star me in one of his next shows.
Oh, listen, Ricky, I have a confession to make.
I did a terrible thing.
I was the voice of Tillie.
But that other voice, Mrs. Merriweather, it was real.
: It certainly was.
Fred Mertz.
You were the other voice.
Yeah, and I thought Tillie was a real spook.
Oh, no!
Wait a minute, wait a minute, there's something else I don't understand.
If Tillie wasn't Mrs. Merriweather, who was she?
Oh, well, um, Mr. Merriweather explained that to me, and he paid you a great compliment.
He said he knew it was the real thing because it sounded exactly like Tillie if she could talk.
Well, that's very flattering.
If she could talk?
Well, you see Tillie was Mr. Merriweather's cocker spaniel.
Oh, no!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Hello.
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Oh, just straightening up.
You know I can't stand it if the house isn't neat.
A place for everything and everything in its place.
That's the way I like it.
Well, Ricky ought to be home any minute.
No, I had dinner.
Ricky ate downtown at the club.
Gee, I don't know what we're doing tonight.
I'll call you back after Ricky gets home.
Okay, dear.
Ah  Ay!
Hello, Ricky baby, I Hi.
Well!
What's the matter?
How could a cyclone hit in here and not hit in the kitchen?
What are you talking about, a cyclone?
Well, something hit this room.
Where?
I don't see anything wrong.
Oh, you don't?
Would you mind telling me, please, what all these clothes are doing here in the living room?
Oh, that's where I took them off.
Would you put them away for me, dear?
Look, honey, there's a new invention you'll just love- it's a hole in the wall, has a long pole in it, little metal things hanging on it and it's called a coat closet.
Well, what won't they think of next?
Oh, honestly, Ricky.
How can you men be so sloppy and dirty?
You're nothing but a bunch of mess cats.
There's nothing sloppy and dirty about this room.
It just looks, uh, lived in.
Well, that's a good answer if you happen to be a pig.
Honey, just drop the subject, will you?
I'd be glad to drop it if there's any more room on the floor.
You can't expect me to live in a museum.
A man's home is his castle, and this is my castle.
Oh, all right, your majesty.
I bow to Ricardo the first king of the slobs.
Thank you, my faithful subject.
Don't expect this slave to pick up after you.
If you want the house to look like this, okay, you can just sit and wallow in it.
Ay, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.
Well, here's a whole spread on Tommy Dorsey at home, and you know something?
What?
He has his shoes on and a tie, too.
Yeah?
What-what magazine is that?
Your musician's magazine, The Half Beat.
It is?
Let me see that.
Well, how do you like that?
My press agent told me I was going to get the next spread.
It was going to be "Ricky Ricardo At Home.
" What magazine was it going to be in, Better Homes and Garbage?
No, smarty, in that magazine.
That's a very important magazine in the music business.
Wait till I hear from Kenny.
Some press agent he is.
Hello.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi, dear.
No, I don't think we're doing anything.
Why don't you and Fred come on up.
Okay.
Ethel and Fred are coming up, honey.
Put your shoes on and pick up those papers.
What for?
Because company is coming.
It isn't company, it's Fred and Ethel.
Well, put your shoes on.
They know I have feet.
Ricky, are you going to help me clean up this place or aren't you?
No, this is my home and I want to be comfortable in it.
Your home?
What does that make me, a visiting relative?
Oh, honey, I didn't mean it that way.
You know, I was under the impression that half of everything in this house was mine.
All right, all right, you go ahead and clean your half of everything and leave my half just the way it is.
All right, we'll divide the room in half.
I'll keep my half the way I want to, you keep your half any way you please.
Are you kidding?
No, I'm very serious.
Huh.
We'll make a line right about here.
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.
Esta mujer esta absolutamente loca.
Never mind that.
Now, honey, wait just a minute.
Just stay right over there.
That's your line.
You can't come over here without a passport.
Oh, for goodness' sakes.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
That's on the line.
I just want a cigarette!
Well, half of what's in this pack is mine.
You mean that's the only cigarette we have in the house?
Yep.
You get Philip and I get Morris.
Stay off my side.
Oh, I forgot about the Mertzes.
What are these things doing over here on my side?
Come in.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi, folks.
Hi.
What's this?
Before you settle down, whose side do you want to sit on?
Huh?
Over there in the neat side of the house, or over here with us mess cats?
What's going on here?
Well, Ricky and I had an argument about his being so messy, so I divided the apartment in two.
This is my side, that's Ricky's side.
I wondered what happened over there.
What's the matter with it?
It looks okay to me.
Okay?
Sure, there's nothing wrong.
Just looks lived in.
Atta boy, Fred.
Would you like to join me in the comfortable part of the house?
Delighted.
Well, pull up some debris and sit down, Fred.
Don't touch anything on your way over here.
Everything over there is sterilized.
Lucy, do you mind if I sit on this side?
No, I think you might find it rather pleasant over here until the wind changes.
Why don't you take your shoes off, Fred?
Oh, can I do that?
Yeah.
Oh, gee, thanks.
Ah, what a relief.
Take your coat off.
Well, thanks.
Thank you.
Here, I'll hang it up for you.
Ah.
Go ahead.
Would you like some fruit?
Yeah, I love fruit.
All right.
Here, Fred, have a banana.
Thanks.
Good-looking banana.
Uh-uh-uh.
It's on the line.
We have to answer it.
We're going to.
Hello?
Well, go ahead, listen to your half and see who it is.
Oh, it's Kenny, my press agent.
Tell him I'm plenty mad at him.
Hello, Kenny, Ricky says to tell you he's plenty mad at you.
Why am I mad at you?
Huh!
Because you've been promising me a spread in Half Beat Note magazine since last February.
Splain that if you can.
Because you've been promising me a spread in Half Beat magazine since last Febriary.
Splain that if you can.
Oh.
I see.
They're gonna do the next one on me.
Okay.
Well, so long, kid, take it easy.
So long, kid, take a tease-y.
If I hadn't seen it, I wouldn't believe it.
Well, I saw it and I still don't believe it.
Come on, Fred, you want some cold beer?
Yeah, I'd love it.
I think I got some cold chicken in the icebox, too.
Come on.
Uh-uh-uh, kitchen's on my side, remember.
You mean I can never go into the kitchen?
And stand back a little, you're over the line.
What am I supposed to do, starve to death?
Oh, I'll toss you a crust of bread now and then.
Hungry, Ethel?
Are you kidding?
Come on, we'll have some beer and cold chicken and we'll toss the bottles and bones on Ricky's side.
Oh, say, remind me- I want to show you some bath salts that I got.
They were on sale.
Oh, show them to me now.
Okay.
Uh-uh-uh, may I see your passport?
I just want to show Ethel my new bath salts.
Well, I'm terribly sorry, but the bathroom is on my side.
Do you mean that I can never go into the bathroom?
That's right.
No more taking a shower, no more washing your face, no more doing whatever it is you do to your hair.
Well, no more food for you.
Okay, we'll see who holds out the longest.
Come back in a couple of weeks, Ethel, we'll still be here- a starving Cuban and a dirty brunette.
Whenever old man trouble makes trouble arise Just put a big straw hat over your eyes You'll never see the circumstance making you Is this a new number?
It is, Maggie.
Oh, glory be, I've got to see this.
Now, don't do it till I get seated.
Okay.
You know, you're my best critic.
Are you ready?
I am.
Whenever old man trouble Makes trouble arise Just put a big straw hat over your eyes You'll never see the circumstance making you frown If you just push your eyes under the crown.
Life can be a simple thing A simple thing to laugh and sing Get yourself a hat of straw and put it on Don't take it off And when the landlord tells you the rent's in arrears A big straw hat over your ears You'll never hear the dialogue tragically grim If you just push your ear, mm!
Under the brim.
iAgua!

Yeah!
Very good, Maggie.
Hey!
Hey!
Very good!
Yeah!
Oh life can be a simple thing A simple thing To laugh and sing Get yourself a hat of straw Put it on Don't take it off No.

Well?
Oh, that's wonderful.
Oh, thank you, Maggie, thank you very much.
I'm sure the pleasure was all mine.
Oh, that's it.
All right, fellows.
All right, take ten.
Take ten.
And I mean ten, not half an hour.
Hi, Rick.
Hi, Kenny.
How is this for fast action?
I promised you last night you were going to get the next magazine spread.
Meet the photographer who's going to shoot it, Jim White.
Hello, Jim.
Hello, Ricky.
I'd like to shoot those pictures tonight.
All right, I think tonight will be wonderful.
You should get very good stuff here tonight.
Yeah, and I'll tell you something else I'd like to do, Ricky- some pictures of your home life.
Oh, sure.
What kind of a place have you got?
Well, I have a little apartment in a reconverted brownstone.
Say, I'd better call the wife and tell her you're coming.
Give her a little warning, eh?
Well, to tell you the truth, James, she doesn't need any warning.
She's the best little housekeeper you ever saw.
Everything is always as neat as a pin.
Well, we got to go.
Jim'll meet you here after rehearsal you can take him out to the house.
Okay, I'll see you then.
Fine.
Bye.
Oh, you don't say, Marge, is that so?
Really?
Well, it's certainly good to get the other side of the story for a change.
Hey, do you know we've been gabbing for 45 minutes?
Yeah, well, let's get together next week and have a real talk.
Okay, dear, bye.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Welcome to tobacco road.
How did Ricky get out of the house this morning without crossing the line?
Through the bedroom window?
No, he used the back door.
We made a deal: I swapped him kitchen privileges for bathroom rights.
Lucy, how long can this go on?
Oh, it's over now.
I'm going to clean up the whole house this afternoon.
Well, thank goodness.
Oh, I forgot what I came up for.
Ricky just called me.
Your line was busy.
What'd he want?
He said to tell you he's bringing a magazine photographer home tonight to take some pictures, and he wants you to clean up the house perfectly- all of it.
Oh, he won't keep it clean for me, but when it's important for him, he wants the whole house cleaned up perfectly- all of it.
Let's face it, he's a man.
Serve him right if I left it just the way it is.
Yeah.
Hey, I'll do it.
Oh, Lucy, you wouldn't.
Yes, I would.
What about that photographer?
Oh, that doesn't matter.
It's just for that silly musician's magazine.
Nobody ever reads it anyway.
And as soon as I make my point I'll tell him it's a gag.
And as long as it's a gag, I might as well go whole hog.
Ethel, will you help me?
Sure, what do you want me to do?
Well, listen, when Ricky comes home with that photographer, we'll have the whole place Well, here we are, Jim What's all this?
Is this your apartment?
Well, it sure doesn't look anything like the  Well, what do you know, Jim?
We got into the wrong apartment after all.
Let's get out of here.
Hi, Ricky honey.
Say Say!
What gives here?
Do you know who this is?
I don't even know what it is.
Get me a stick and I'll kill it.
: Aren't you going to introduce your bitty, bitty bride?
Lucy, I swear Is this your wife?
Why, sure!
Yes, Jim.
This is my wife.
Lucy, meet Jim White.
Pleased to meet ya.
Whoa!
I got an itch.
: Ah Lucy Lucy, whatever you're up to, cut it out.
What's the matter?
Look at the way this place looks!
Yeah, it looks pretty good, don't it?
You should have seen it 'fore I cleaned it up.
It's a regular pigpen!
Oh, it ain't a regular one, but it'll do.
You know we don't keep pigs in here- just chickens!
Jim, Jim, please, please.
Please, Jim, now, look, believe me this place has never looked like this before in my whole life and and there isn't a chicken within ten miles of here!
Boy, she's flying high tonight, ain't she!
Oh, Lucy, Lucy Lucy, please, Lucy, come on, let's clean it up.
Here, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick.
Honey honey, do you realize that this man is a very important photographer?
Oh, boy!
Take my picture, will ya, sonny?
I'd be glad to.
Oh, wait a minute, I got to comb my hair.
There we are.
Ha-ha!
Yeah, boy.
Oh, no.
Ay!
Ah Oh, my god.
Ha, it's messy, ain't it?
I got to see if my clothes are dry.
Grandma!
You been hangin' there all day?
Yep.
Must have been quite a trip coming through the washing machine.
I didn't mind the washing machine, but I durn near passed out comin' through the wringer.
Well, come on, grandma, we're goin' huntin'.
Gotta bag our supper.
Huntin'?
Huntin'!
Get ready, get ready, get ready A- huntin' we will go A- huntin' we will go Hi-ho dee-da-dee-die A- huntin' we will go.
A- huntin' we will go A- huntin' we will go Jim, please believe me- I don't know what's going on here.
I've seen her do strange things before but this time I think she really snapped her cap.
She says she's going hunting.
Hunting.
Hunting in the bedroom.
How do you like that.
That's the most ridiculous thing  What is that?
!
A- hunting we will go, a-hunting we will go And a-hunting we will go.
Whew!
This ought to give your musician fellers a laugh, huh?
What do you mean, musician fellows?
Well, who else reads your durn magazine but musician fellers?
Yeah.
Lucy Huh?
This man is not from Half Beat magazine.
He ain't?
No, I'm from Look magazine.
Hi, Lucy.
Honey, what's the matter?
Look magazine came out today.
Oh, did they do the spread on me?
How did it look?
Oh, it was wonderful for you.
They showed the nightclub and the band and the shots of you singing.
Oh, honey, what are you crying about?
Jim White promised me he wouldn't use a single picture of you in the article.
No, I wasn't in the article.
I made the cover.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Lucy!
I'm home!
Lucy!
: Yoo-hoo!
Where are you?
I'm right here, dear.
Lucy, how you've changed!
Yes, it's a new way I'm doing my hair.
Where is she, Fred?
She's gone to market.
Oh, well, I'm glad to see that you're finally fixing that drain.
What do you mean, finally?
When was the first time you told me this drain leaked?
The day after we moved here- August That's right, and that's pretty good service for my building.
Fred, aren't you finished with that drain yet?
Not quite.
Well, come on downstairs- dinner's ready.
Stop ordering me around, will you?
Now, listen, Fred Mertz Come here.
Come in, Ethel.
I want to show you something.
Come in here.
You, too, curly.
All right, all right.
Oh, a mink coat!
Oh, Ricky, Lucy will just go out of her mind!
I ought to slug you.
What are you trying to do- make a bum out of me?
Don't blame that on him.
You were a bum before he was born.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
Hold it, hold it!
This coat is not for Lucy.
It isn't?
No.
Saved by the bell.
I just rented it.
One of the girls is going to wear it in a dance number down at the club.
Oh.
Well, don't show it to Lucy.
You know how she's always wanted a mink coat.
Yeah, I know, but she can't have this one.
You know how much this thing costs?
I may faint!
Ricky?
Yes?
Could I play like it's mine, just for a little while?
Sure, come here, put it on.
Oh!
Ooh!
Be careful, now.
Don't wrinkle it.
I won't.
And don't get attached to it, Miss Minnie Mink.
Oh, I can dream, can't I?
Hi, everybody!
Hi!
Ethel, a mink coat!
When did you get it?
Uh Just now.
But from whom?
Him.
Fred!
Oh, uh, wasn't that generous of old fat Fred?
Oh, my goodness, yes!
What was the occasion, Fred?
Oh, I just thought it was about time to buy the old battle-ax the-the little woman a trinket of some kind, so I picked up that bunch of skins.
Oh, bunch of skins.
Isn't he wonderful?
Oh, Ethel you look so beautiful and so glamorous.
Honey, look, I got something to tell you.
Don't talk to me, you tightwad!
Lucy!
It's a pity you couldn't buy me a coat if he could buy one for her.
How can you stand there and laugh when I feel so awful?
You know I've always wanted a mink coat, and now she  she  Oh, Lucy!
Oh, I'm sorry, Ricky.
That's all right, Ethel.
I'll straighten it out.
Lucy!
Honey!
Honey, don't cry.
Let me explain.
Don't bother.
Oh, honey, I'm trying to tell you that coat doesn't belong to Ethel.
It's all right.
I can wear this ratty old cloth coat for another four It doesn't?
No, I brought the coat home.
Ethel was just trying it on.
Oh, honey, you big, wonderful husband.
Wait, wait!
Honey, you don't understand, honey!
Yes, I do understand.
You were just making a big joke with me.
Now, honey Where's my coat?
It's mine.
Oh, it's mine, Ethel!
Oh, isn't it beautiful?
It's just dreamy.
Honey, honey, wait.
Before you get too excited, honey, it's something I have to tell you.
What?
Well, honey, you see You know what's wonderful about this present, Ricky?
You didn't forget our anniversary.
Well, look, honey, I It's the most perfect present.
How did you know it was just what I wanted, honey?
Well, honey, you see, what I was I only I had a hunch you'd like it.
Oh, you had a hunch.
And you two sly ones in on the joke all the time.
Yeah.
Happy anniversary.
Thank you!
Ricky, I'm so in love with this coat that I'm never going to take it off.
Never, never, never!
Come on, Ethel, let's see how I look in the full-length mirror.
Come on!
Okay.
Come on, already!
All right.
Why didn't you tell her the truth?
If I tell her the truth it'd get me in worse hot water- forgetting our anniversary.
I should have brought her something.
You brought her something now, brother.
She can't keep it.
I got to get it back somehow.
How?
She's never going to take it off!
"Never, never, never"!
She's got to take it off when she goes to bed.
Hey!
I'll sneak it away during the night.
I'll open a few drawers, mess things up a little bit and I'll tell her it was stolen by a burglar.
Hey, you got something up there.
How'd you ever get an idea like that?
It's easy- I think of it in Spanish and then I translate it into English.
Wh-what happened?
Nothing, honey.
Go back to sleep.
Lucy!
Yes?
What are you doing?
Washing dishes.
Washing dishes!
Ricky, anything wrong, dear?
Wrong?
Oh, no, honey, no.
Good.
No, there's nothing wrong.
I'm going in and get dressed.
I want to go downtown to show my coat off to everybody.
All right.
Lucy You see, it's not for me.
It's just that I want everybody to realize what a wonderful, wonderful husband I have.
Anybody home?
Come in, Fred.
I gather from the look on your face that Lucy is still attached to that coat.
I'm beginning to think that the coat is attached to Lucy.
I don't know what to do, Fred.
The show is tomorrow.
I got to get that coat back tonight or else.
Well, you got any ideas?
No.
But there must be some way.
I got it!
What?
It's simple!
Just tell her there was an epidemic of sick minks last year and one of the bad skins slipped past the fur inspector.
What?
Sure.
And you have to have that coat fumigated.
Otherwise, she might break out with a very bad case of mink pox.
Mink's pox?
Yeah, and it sounds even worse with your accent.
Now look, Fred, never mind, I don't like that.
Look, you remember the idea I had about the burglar?
Yeah.
All right, the burglar is going to show up tonight.
What?
Tonight when we sound sleep, a phony burglar is going to come in here and demand that coat at the point of a gun.
Hey, that's wonderful!
Besides, there's been a burglar scare in the neighborhood lately.
Yeah, that's what gave me the idea.
Do you suppose she'll think he's a phony?
Not if you cover your face with a mask.
That's a good idea.
Hey, wait a minute, now.
I draw the line at prowling around in other people's apartments in the middle of the night.
Now, look, Fred.
Uh let's look at it this way.
If you don't do it, Lucy will keep the coat.
Yeah.
Now, Ethel wants everything that Lucy gets.
Yeah.
So pretty soon, you will have to buy Ethel All right, what time do you want me to break in?
Hey, what kept you?
You're late.
Stick them up!
Ouch!
What are you doing with that thing?
Come on, let's wake her up.
I said stick them up!
Stop fooling around with that gun.
Why do you have to ham it up all over the joint all the time?
Come on.
Now, listen, you stay right here until I wake her up.
Shh.
Lucy!
What?
I got a feeling there's somebody else in this room besides us.
Really?
Yeah.
Hands up and keep them up!
What's in this box?
Please, Mr. Burglar, take our money, take our jewels but don't take my wife's mink coat.
It's worth 3,500 bucks oh!
Is that real mink?
No, no, it's mink-dyed imitation skunk.
Eww!
Smells awful, you wouldn't want it.
Hand it over.
No, no, no!
No, no!
Hand me that coat.
No, you can't have it.
No!
Give me that coat.
No!
Lady!
Hand over that coat or I'll shoot.
Wait a minute.
Okay, go ahead and shoot.
Look, lady, I don't want to get nasty.
Hand me that coat.
No!
Ricky, do something.
All right, honey.
Listen, you, are you really going to shoot us if we don't give you this coat?
Yeah.
My hero!
Honey, your life is worth much more to me than a hunk of fur.
What's that?
A ladder!
Hey, there's something screwy about this joint.
I'm getting out of here.
Hey, you forgot the coat!
Ricky, are you crazy?
!
Give me that!
What's the matter with you?
!
Honey, be careful.
I'm going to call the police.
Be careful.
Stick them up!
Pretty good, eh, Rick?
Oh, you've already been here.
I have?
I have not!
Y- y-you mean that that that guy was real?
What do you mean?
There was a real burglar here a minute ago.
Oh, no!
Yes!
Come on, let's go catch him.
I don't want to catch him.
What are you afraid of?
You've got a gun.
I don't think I'd better use it on him.
Why not?
Good morning, Lucy.
Hello.
What's the matter with you?
Oh.
Gee, I thought you'd be happy this morning.
Believe me, I'd be happy if a burglar came and didn't get my mink coat.
Well, I'm happy about that, but I'm so disappointed in Ricky.
Ethel, I'm married to a coward.
Are you still moping 'cause Ricky didn't struggle with an armed burglar?
Well, you should have seen it.
Ricky gave him the coat.
I'm surprised he didn't gift wrap it for him.
Oh Well, the way Ricky was acting, it's good the burglar didn't come in and ask for me.
Now, Lucy.
I'm sure Ricky would have been brave if he'd known it was a real burglar.
Uh I think I hear Fred calling me.
Ethel, what are you saying?
What do you mean- real burglar?
Uh nothing, just, uh Ethel, what did you start to say?
Well, I might as well tell you.
It's better than your thinking Ricky is a coward, anyway.
Was it a real burglar or wasn't it?
It really was, but Ricky thought it was Fred.
Fred?
Yes, that's why he didn't try to fight him.
Well, why would Fred pretend to be a burglar?
Uh I can't tell you any more.
Lucy!
Please!
I'm not a yo-yo!
Ethel, I want the whole story.
All right, your honor.
Well, you see, Ricky didn't intend to give you the coat.
He just rented it to use for a dancing number down at the club.
You mean this isn't my coat?
No, honey.
Oh But at least you know Ricky isn't a coward.
How do you like that?
All this time he let me go on thinking this was my coat.
I've been living in a mink's paradise.
Now, Lucy, don't get upset.
Oh, I'm going to get even with him if it's the last thing I do.
I ought to carve my initials in it with an electric razor.
Ohh!
What are you going to do?
You know that costume store downtown where they sell imitation fur coats?
Yeah.
Well, I'm going down there today and I'm going to get a coat exactly like this.
And tonight when Ricky comes home Lucy, this is a pretty poor imitation.
Don't you think Ricky will know it isn't real mink?
Well, honey, I will, but I don't think Ricky will.
You know how men are.
Yeah.
I've got this thing fixed so it'll scare him to death.
Now, when we go out there, this is what I want you to do.
Have you figured out how to get the coat away from her?
Yup.
How?
I'm going to tell her the truth.
Gosh, I hadn't thought of that.
But what of the anniversary?
I'll get her a couple of minks and let her raise her own coat.
Hiya, fellas!
Hi, girls.
Ethel, what are you doing in that coat?
I asked her to put it on.
I want to take a look at it.
I'm thinking of restyling it.
Restyling it?
Yeah, I think I look better in a short jacket, don't you, Ethel?
Uh-huh.
What are you cutting?
What are you cutting!
?
What are you cutting?
Oh, no!
No, no, no!
Just a minute.
Oh, no, no, it's terrible!
They've gone crazy.
Crazy they've gone, both of them.
You know what I think?
I think that it's unbalanced.
I think it needs shorter sleeves.
No, please, please.
Please don't cut it no more.
Please Oh!
look at that.
Well, it'll make a nice muff.
Hey, look at me, I'm a fur stylist!
Oh no, no!
Oh, no, no.
There you are.
Congratulations, Ethel.
You're the first woman to ever wear a mink T-shirt.
Look, Ricky.
Ohh!
How do you like it?
It's darling.
Ricky sent it to me at noon and at 3:00, these came, and at 5:00, this arrived.
Oh!
Isn't it dreamy?
Yeah.
Even though you didn't get a mink coat, I think you did pretty well for your anniversary.
So do I, considering it wasn't our anniversary.
Lucy, what do you mean?
Well, whenever there's a good present in sight, I always tell Ricky it's our anniversary.
Oh, no!
When is your anniversary?
It's on, um uh Well, how do you like that?
I've fibbed about it so much and now I've forgotten.
Ricky, darling, I just love the things you sent!
I'm glad, honey.
You know, I actually ordered all these things for your anniversary last week but, uh, the store forgot to send them.
Really?
Yes- happy anniversary, Lucy.
Happy anniversary, darling.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Good morning, Lucy.
Lucy!
Good morning.
Shh!
Ricky's still asleep.
What's on your mind, Ethel?
Oh, nothing.
You want to borrow something?
Eggs, sugar, flour?
No, thanks.
Are you sure there's nothing on your mind?
No, not a thing.
How about a cup of coffee?
No, thanks.
Well, I must say you're taking it calmly.
How's that?
I said I must say you're taking it calmly.
Now it comes.
What's on your mind, Ethel?
Look, honey, you don't have to pretend with me.
I come to you this morning not just as a landlady, not just as a friend, but as a shoulder on which to weep in this time of crisis.
Well.
I think you've been twisting those curlers too tight.
Oh, honey, you're wonderful.
It's not every wife who can keep her sense of humor when her husband's running around with another woman.
: Oh, Ethel.
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
What do you mean another woman?
Have you seen this morning's paper?
No.
Oh, well, I'm not going to be the one to show it to you.
Oh, you're not?
Page eight, column two.
"What Cuban bandleader with the initials R.R. "is making cat's eyes at his dancing mouse?
"There's more going on during that floor show than the script calls for.
" Oh, Ethel, that's just a publicity story.
It is, huh?
Sure, Ricky's press agent put that in.
He did, huh?
Certainly.
He has to keep Ricky's name before the public.
He does, huh?
Ricky doesn't care anything about that new dancer of his.
Ha!
What's she like?
Rosemary?
Oh, she's a brunette and she has a wonderful figure and she's young and quite pretty.
Oh, Ethel, it's just a publicity story.
Ricky is trustworthy, fine, honest and loyal.
Well, if he was brave, clean and thrifty he'd be a Boy Scout.
A cat's eye patrol, of course.
All right, Ethel, that's enough.
I'll be right down, Fred.
Look, honey, don't let this get you down.
Ethel, I love Ricky.
He's the most wonderful husband in the world, and I trust him implicitly.
You just keep saying that.
Ricky, it's time to get up, dear.
Time to get up, Ricky.
Hi, honey.
Are you awake, dear?
Uh-huh.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, what's that for?
That's for being a big two-timer, you you Cuban heel.
What?
Open your big cat's eyes and read this.
Hey, cut it out!
Honey, honey, cut it out!
Honey, come on, now.
Cut it out.
That's just a publicity story.
It is, huh?
Sure, my press agent put that in.
He did, huh?
Well, he has to keep my name in front of the public.
He does, huh?
Why, honey, I don't care anything about that new dancer.
Ha!
Oh, honey.
You can trust me.
I can, huh?
Why, sure.
I'm as faithful as an old dog.
Yeah, old Rover.
Oh, Lucy, you know I don't love anyone else but you.
There's nothing between Rosemary and me, honey.
Cross your heart?
Well, I think I have a better way to convince you.
Did that convince you?
What were we talking about?
I don't know.
Oh, Rosemary.
Oh.
Honey, now, you got to get used to those kind of stories.
You know, they're going to keep showing up as long as I'm in show business.
Well Look, honey, why don't you come down to the club and see for yourself.
Oh, no, that's not necessary.
Well, if there's any doubt in your mind at all No, no.
None whatsoever.
Come on, honey, you've got to get dressed.
You'll be late for rehearsal.
Okay, Rosemary.
What?
!
I meant Lucy.
Yeah.
All right, all right, break it up, break it up.
We have to go through the whole Saturday night show.
Come on.
Let's break it up.
You're always squawking about something.
Come on, will you?
We got a lot of work to do today.
Playing cards, arguing about the salary, reading the racing form Where is Rosemary?
Is she late again?
No, no, she's getting into her costume for the Jezebel number.
All right.
Well, let's take a let's take a letter "A," huh?
And please, the first fellow who acts like he's playing in his sleep is going to get traded to Phil Spitalny.
Let's do it nice.
Put a little pep into it.
Here we go.
All right, all right, all right.
Hi, Ricky.
Hi.
Is this okay?
That's great, if we don't get raided.
Listen, I want to Before we start on this number, I want to find out what happens in the first part of the dance.
You know, when you go around me in the first part of the number, how does it go?
Step, step, round.
And then what else?
You go around here again?
And then I come back here.
And then you come back and we go again?
Oh, no!
Oh Gee, me and my big feet.
I'm sorry, kid.
Gee, I hope I can get it fixed by the show.
Well, I tell you what- give it to me and I'll have it fixed for you.
Oh, you're a doll.
Well, I'll go and change before this thing tears some more.
All right.
I'll be back in a minute.
Let's take something now that she's gone.
Let's take "Cumbachero," huh?
From the top?
All right, here we go.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Something is wrong with that first chord there.
Wait a minute.
I've got an E-natural there, Ricky.
E- natural?
That should be E-flat concert.
Let's try it, I think that's right.
Just the brass alone.
That's it, that's it.
Now, everybody now.
All right?
Here we go.
Here it is.
Oh, put it in my coat pocket, will you?
Listen, get, uh the Jezebel number, now.
When she's ready, all right?
The Jezebel number from the top.
Everybody.
Here we go.
Who is it?
What?
Look, honey, chicken and rice.
Arroz con pollo!
Yeah.
Oh, boy!
What did I do to rate all this?
Well, I'm trying to make up for being so silly this morning.
Oh, honey, forget it.
No.
I was wrong to mistrust you and I'm ashamed of myself.
Do you forgive me?
Well, I I guess so.
Of course, I was terribly hurt.
Oh.
How could you possibly think that I could look at anyone else but you?
Oh, go on- you didn't give it a second thought all day.
I din't, huh?
No, you din't.
Listen, I couldn't think of anything else.
You know where I spent all afternoon?
Where?
Uh I went to the park.
Oh?
Yeah, I went to the park and I sat there and I fed the pigeons and, uh and I brooded.
You mean you didn't even go to rehearsal?
Uh?
Is that what you meant to tell me?
Well, that's not exactly what I meant to tell you Oh, honey, then you do care about me.
Of course, I do.
You were so upset you couldn't even go to rehearsal.
That's right, honey.
Oh-ho, baby.
Honey, let's eat, would you?
I'm hungry.
Look at all that wonderful food!
What is this?
What is that?
Now, now, baby, now.
Don't "now, baby" me.
What is this?
Oh!
Oh, that.
Oh, well, that's, uh that's, uh a black-lace Blue jeans?
Now, honey So this is why you didn't go to rehearsal today.
Now, wait a minute, honey.
You may have been in the park all afternoon, but you weren't feeding the pigeons.
Now, Lucy, if you just give me a chance to 'splain.
All right.
All right, I want to be fair about this.
'Splain.
Well, you You'll have to speak louder than that.
All right, I'll tell you the truth.
Well, that'll be novel.
You haven't tried that before.
I did not go to the park this afternoon and fed the pigeons.
No.
I went to rehearsal.
Yeah.
And that's Rosemary's, uh black-lace, uh Blue jeans.
Yeah.
I tore it by mistake, so she took it off and she put it in my pocket.
Ha!
Well, if you don't believe me, ask the boys in the band.
They were all there.
Well, that must have been a cozy gathering.
Now, look, honey, I went to rehearsal.
That's part of the costume that Rosemary wears in the Jezebel number.
I stepped on it, it tore, she took it off, she put in my pocket and I brought it home for you to fix.
Is that the truth, Ricky?
Cross my heart.
You do believe me, don't you, honey?
Of course, dear.
There is one other question I'd like to ask you, though.
What's that?
Where were you this afternoon?
!
Now, look, honey, I told you the truth and that's the end of it.
No, it isn't.
All right, if you don't believe me, come down to the club tonight and see for yourself.
You're darn right, I will.
All right!
All right!
Well, good-bye.
Good-bye!
Excuse me.
Come on in, Ethel.
I was just polishing the doorknob.
I suppose you heard everything.
No, honey, not a thing.
Well, I just quarreled with Ricky.
I don't blame you.
Who does he think he is going around, tearing girls' black-lace blue jeans?
Didn't hear a thing, huh?
Well, I might have caught a word here and there.
You going to throw all that food out?
Well, Ricky, doesn't want it.
Do you want some?
Um no, I'm not a bit hungry.
Well, I might just taste it to see how your recipe is.
What's your next move, honey?
I'm going down to that club tonight.
He's pretty clever asking you to come down to the club.
Huh?
You're not dumb enough to fall for that, are you?
I should say not.
Fall for what?
You go down there tonight; he knows you're coming; he's on his good behavior; you're satisfied; you come home; and he starts playing cat and mouse again.
Why, that big stinker!
Well, gee, what'll I do?
You're going to call him up and tell him you're not coming down.
Yeah!
Why?
Because you're going to sneak in there without his knowing it and watch the floor show and see what's really going on.
Gee, that's a wonderful idea.
I'll call right now.
Oh, wait a minute.
I can't sneak into the club.
Everybody knows me down there.
That won't work.
Well, we'll think of something.
Well, what?
I don't know, but you call him up and tell him you're not coming down.
All right.
Just leave it to me.
Okay.
Hello, this is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Would you please tell Mr. Ricardo that I won't be able to come down to the club tonight.
That's right.
Thank you.
I've got it.
What?
Where's the best place to see what he's doing on the stage?
Where?
Right on the stage.
Now, he does a number with Rosemary, doesn't he?
Yeah.
And there are dancing girls  Right over there is where the girls go onto the stage.
Now make sure you get the girls out there in time for the Jezebel number.
And tell Bill Caine, the electrician, to be on his toes.
That's my favorite number and I don't want it loused up.
Now, get going.
We got to hide.
Hey, wait a minute.
There's something else I want to show you in here.
Would be better had I never known A lover such as you Forsaken dreams are all for the siren call of your arms Like a demon love possess me you Obsess me constantly Whatever star is mine that my fate's design should be Jezebel If ever a devil was born without a pair of horns It was you Jezebel It was you If ever an angel fell Jezebel It was you Jezebel It was you If ever a pair of eyes promised paradise Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me blue Jezebel It was you.
If ever a pair of eyes promised paradise Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me blue Jezebel Jezebel If ever the devil's plan was made to torment man It was you Night and day, every way Jezebel Jezebel Jezebel!
Lucy!
Lucy.
Oh, did I wake you up, dear?
Oh, that's all right.
I went to bed early.
Oh, you did?
Yeah, about 8:30.
What time is it?
It's about 2:30.
Oh, really?
You know, the funniest thing happened tonight down at the club.
What?
A strange girl got into the chorus line.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
She was terrible, too.
She was real ugly.
And she had the worst figure I've ever seen.
And she didn't know any of the steps at all.
Well, how could a thing like that possibly happen, dear?
I haven't got the slightest idea.
Oh, you knew it all the time.
Come here.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}

We'll call you when we get home next week.
Love, Edna and Ben.
What time was it postmarked?
A.M. or P.M.?
Really, Ethel, I'm surprised at you!
You know, this is a federal offense.
If it wasn't for our friendship, I'd turn you over to the FBI.
Thanks, terribly.
No, really, I mean it.
Reading another person's mail is just awful.
A person's mail is something sacred.
It's like, like a diary.
Why, Ricky and I wouldn't think of reading each other's mail.
Now, take this letter, for instance.
It's addressed to Ricky and it's from the War Department.
Now, I'm curious, but I'm certainly not going to War Department?
!
Gee, you don't think Ricky's been been Drafted!
Oh, please, Ethel.
I, I wasn't going to say it out loud.
Oh, look!
Cheap glue.
"You are hereby ordered to report to Fort Dix, New Jersey, Monday at And it's signed, "Maurice Thompson, Colonel Infantry Commanding Officer.
" It's true!
Ricky's been drafted!
Now, Lucy, you've got to be brave.
I'll be brave.
Is that being brave?
It is for a coward like me.
Oh, now, Lucy, pull yourself together.
You know what you ought to do?
What?
Go downtown and buy a new hat.
Oh, Ethel, please don't make jokes.
I'm not joking.
It'll take your mind off your troubles.
No use sitting around here moping.
Well, maybe shopping would help, and while I'm downtown, I'll buy some yarn so I can knit Ricky some socks to wear with his uniform.
That's a good idea!
Now, get your coat.
All right.
Oh, I got to glue this back together again..
I'll fix it.
I've had lots of practice at this.
Oh, all right.
Oh, you know, I know where there's a dilly of a hat!
To take my mind off my troubles, you know.
Yes.
Ethel!
Hiya, Fred.
Hi, Rick, is Ethel up here?
No, I haven't seen her.
She and Lucy must be out shopping someplace.
Uh-oh, that'll cost me.
Hey, we got a card from the Bishers.
They're in Florida.
Yeah, how do you like that guy catching a 115-pound sailfish?
How did you know that he caught a hundred and Oh, Ethel.
Some people build model airplanes.
Ethel reads postcards.
Oh, good, I got my orders to go to Fort Dix Monday.
Orders!
Fort Dix!
Hold on, Fred, hold on.
I haven't been drafted.
Take it easy.
No, I'm just taking a show down there to entertain the boys, and you know how the Army is.
You can't even scratch yourself without orders.
A show!
Hey, that ought to be a lot of fun.
Well, why don't you come along?
You can do one of your old Vaudeville routines?
Great!
You know, I used to do a Civil War act in Vaudeville.
I played the North, and my partner played the South.
I still got the costumes.
Really?
Want to do it with me?
Why sure, I'll be perfect for it- Stonewall Ricardo from south Havana.
I'll show you how the thing goes.
All right, Fred.
Hey, I can use that broom there for the musket.
Ta da  Uh-oh, we're supposed to go out to dinner Monday night, but I'll just tell Ethel I'd rather do this.
Look, whatever you do don't tell Ethel where you're going because if you tell Ethel, she'll tell Lucy, and Lucy will want to get into the act.
Well, why don't you let her sing a song or something?
It wouldn't be patriotic.
Patriotic?
Have you ever heard Lucy sing?
No.
Our fighting men have been through enough.
Okay, not a word to Ethel.
I'll just tell her I'm not available Monday night, and I won't tell her why.
And boy, that'll drive her crazy.
Now, spread out and I'll show you how this thing Okay.
Spread out.
Hi.
Ricky, did you read the mail, dear?
Mm-hmm.
Well?
Well what?
Well, was there anything interesting or different?
No Oh, yes, there was something.
Oh?
What?
Ben Bisher caught a 115-pound sailfish.
Oh.
Don't you have anything else to tell me, Ricky?
About what?
About, about, about  What's new.
Lucy, are you all right?
I'm fine.
Well, honey, what are you crying about?
Did something happen?
Yes, yes, that's it, something happened.
Well, what?
Well, I bought a new hat and I don't know if you'll like it.
Oh, honey, is that all?
Well, let me see it.
Oh, all right.
Why, honey, I like it.
It's real cute.
I'm glad.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi.
It's all true, Ethel.
Ricky's been drafted and he's trying to spare me by not telling me about it.
Oh, Ethel, you're such a good friend to take my troubles so hard.
Thanks, but I've got troubles of my own.
Fred just told me he's going with Ricky Monday.
What?
He wouldn't tell me where, bless his fat little heart.
You mean, he's been drafted?
No, they're not that hard up.
He must have enlisted.
Ethel, we got to pull ourselves together.
If our men are going to be so brave and so wonderful, the least we can do is make it as easy as possible for them.
Yes.
I'm knitting some socks for Fred, too.
That's nice.
We got to be brave, Lucy.
Brave.
We've got to keep a stiff upper lip.
Stiff.
Halt!
Parade rest!
Right shoulder, arms!
One, two, three!
No, no, no!
Who told you to throw your gun away?
I'm sorry, Fred.
Oh, you're sorry.
What good does that do me?
Come on, now, try it again.
All right.
Left face!
Forward march!
Hut!
Hut!
What's the matter with you, Ricky?
Why did you hut it?
I didn't hut it, I was coughing!
Well, how can I know whether you're coughing or hutting?
I don't know where you're going.
I'm going this way, and you hut, hut, hut.
You've been doing it all afternoon.
Now, what's the matter with you?
Well, I'm sorry, Fred.
I just don't seem to be able to concentrate.
I'm worried.
About what?
Well, maybe you can help me.
You've been married for a long while, haven't you?
Now, why bring that up when we're having such a good time?
Well, maybe you know women better than I do.
Lucy's been acting strange lately.
Strange?
How can you tell?
Look, I'm serious.
I mean, for one thing, she breaks into tears for no reason at all, and she seems terribly nervous.
And the other day, I walked into the room and she hid whatever she was doing behind her back.
It looked like knitting.
Knitting?
!
Yeah.
Well, Ricky, my boy, congratulations!
Congratulations?
Why, it's as plain as the nose on your face.
You're going to be a father.
Me?
Father?
When a woman cries for no reason, sits down and knits tiny little things, what else?
Me?
Father?
Of course!
Me?
Father?
Yeah, you father, Lucy mother, me Tarzan!
Oh, gosh.
Well, now that we've straightened out your paternal status, let's go on with the routine.
Okay.
Of course, it could be something else.
When are you going to take facts like I do, Ricky?
Ethel is nervous and weepy lately, too.
She's been knitting little things and hiding them from me.
But you don't think that I that I No!
Oh, no!
Fred!
Congratulations, old boy!
Imagine that, both of them!
I can't imagine it.
Isn't that wonderful!
Let's give them a shower.
What for?
I mean a surprise party shower.
And we can try our act out on the crowd.
All right, we'll give them a surprise party Sunday night before we leave for Fort Dix.
Good deal!
Gee whiz, Lucy's going to be a mother and I'm going to be a father.
I know just how you feel, son.
Ethel's going to be a mother and I'm going to be a f f f Ethel, does this look right?
Right for what?
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
I suppose yours is going to win a prize.
It's better than yours.
Let's see.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Gee, I guess I'm past the sock stage.
I better try for a blanket.
I think you're past the blanket stage.
You'd better try for a tent.
Oh, well, I'm surprised we can knit at all, what with our husbands going into the Army.
Our two wonderful little boys.
Yeah.
Gee, they're so anxious to be good soldiers.
You know what they were doing when I went up to the apartment a little while ago?
What?
Drilling.
Drilling.
Yeah.
Marching up and down with a broom and a mop.
Oh, I wish there was something more we could do for them besides just knitting socks and tents.
I know, let's give them a going-away party.
A surprise party!
Yeah, we'll give it Sunday night just before they leave.
That's a wonderful idea.
Who will we ask?
Well, let's see now, there's the Sedgewicks, the Orsattis, the Bezelles, Billy Josefi Ethel, do you think the boys found out about the party tonight?
No.
They can't think about anything but going into the Army.
Yeah.
Gee, this is their last night as civilians.
Now, remember, we're not going to argue with them, no matter what happens.
I wouldn't think of it.
Where are they now?
They're downstairs drilling.
Bless their little britches.
Now, here's the plan for the party: I told everybody that I'd leave the front door unlocked.
Unlocked.
Yeah.
And that they should tiptoe in and hide someplace.
How we gonna keep the boys occupied so they won't notice?
Oh, now, don't worry.
We'll manage some way.
Who left this door unlocked?
I don't know.
Listen, do you think the girls suspect anything about the party tonight?
No, with all that knitting and acting like little mothers, they don't know anything else is going on.
Listen, I told everybody that I was going to leave the back door unlocked, and that they should sneak in through the kitchen.
So I want you to keep your eye on the kitchen door.
Well, how we gonna hide them from the girls?
Well, look, whenever the people start coming in, we'll just have to figure out some way to get the girls back into the bedroom.
Watch it now, here they come.
I don't know.
Oh, hi, fellas.
Hi.
Hi, girls.
Did you hear anything?
I thought I did.
I think someone's at the door.
I'll get it.
No, no, I'll get it!
I'll get it!
Oh, all right.
No, there's no one here.
Ricky, would you get me a drink of water, please, dear?
Oh, all right.
I'd like a glass of water, too, Fred.
Well, I'll get them both.
No!
No!
I can't drink a glass of water unless Fred brings it to me with his own little hands.
Okay, I'll get 'em both.
No!
No!
Ricky Ricky, honey, you wouldn't want me to have anything that you didn't bring me your little ole self, now, would you, baby?
Well, honey, what difference would it make Well, it does make a difference, though, honey.
I can't tell you exactly what it is, but there is a difference.
All right, all right.
Well, we'll both go.
Okay.
Shh!
Where?
The closet!
Who locked that door?
Well, unlock it.
We brought you milk.
Milk?
It's better for you.
Oh, thanks.
How's the milk, girls?
Fine.
It's all right if you like milk.
Uh, Lucy Hmm?
Your nose is shiny.
It is?
I just powdered it.
Well, stand still a minute, will you?
I want to see how my hair looks.
Oh, you!
Okay, I'll go powder it.
Ethel's nose is shiny, too.
It is not, is it, Fred?
Well, I can't tell, there's such a bright reflection coming off Now, listen, Fred Mertz, it Oh, all right.
I'll go powder my nose.
Where?
The closet!
Shh!
Well, here we are.
Do we look any better?
Oh, yes, fine.
Look great now.
Uh, Ricky, I'm thirsty again.
Would you get me a drink of water, dear?
Well, honey, you haven't finished this one yet.
Oh.
More milk.
Ethel, you just had a full glass of milk.
I don't know why I seem to be so thirsty tonight.
I must have had something salty for dinner.
All right, all right, more milk.
I'll get you some more, too, honey.
All right.
Shh!
The closet?
The closet.
Here you are, girls.
Uh, Lucy?
What?
Your nose is shiny again.
Oh, now, Ricky, really, it couldn't be shiny Oh, all right, dear.
And Ethel I know, I'm going.
Where?
The closet!
Hey, Fred, come on, I got a wonderful idea.
Good.
Oh, Lucy, you're crazy!
I'm glad you kids didn't lose your sense of humor.
Why should we lose our sense of humor?
Yeah.
Well, you know how women act when they're in your condition.
My condition?
What's my condition?
Well, honey The same as Ethel's.
Ethel's?
Sure, we know all about it.
Come on, honey, sit down.
You have to take it real easy, you know, and have a good rest, be real comfortable all the time.
Fred, what are you talking about?
Come on, darling, sit down now.
Why?
Coochie, coochie, coochie.
Now, wait a minute.
You guys act like somebody's going to have a baby.
Well, someone is.
Well, don't look at me!
Well, don't look at me!
Well, don't look at us!
Well, what made you think anybody was going to have a baby?
Well what were all those little things that you were knitting?
Knitting!
Oh, honey, we were knitting socks for you and Fred to take to Fort Dix tomorrow.
You knew about that?
Yes, and we're just dying to see you in your uniforms.
Well, come on, Rick, let's put them on.
Yeah, we'll put them on!
Let's go, Fred!
We'll put them right on.
Oh, imagine them thinking we were going to have babies!
Yeah, they certainly can jump at some wrong conclusions.
Yeah.
Gee, I wish there were some wrong conclusions that we could jump to.
Are you ready, girls?
!
Yes!
Yeah, we're ready.
Ooh, we're going to get to see our soldier boys!
Are you ready, Colonel Mertz?
Colonel?
Ready, General Ricardo!
General?
Ethel, they're fighting on opposite sides!
Oh, Ricky, you should have seen the expression on your face!
Well, honey, how was I supposed to know?
Well, we all did some pretty fancy jumping to conclusions!
You know what?
What?
We invited everyone here for a going-away party!
No kidding!
Well, you know something?
We invited them over here for a shower.
A shower?
The closet!
Oh, look at these poor people!
Easy!
Pull them apart!
Pull them apart!
Unglue, unglue.
Unglue them there, pull them apart!
Lucy and Ricky will be back with a little surprise.
Stand by.
Oh, look!
Fred!
Ethel!
Lucy!
Fred!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, Fred.
We're all Santa Clauses.
Yeah.
How about that.
Let's put our presents under the tree.
Okay, okay, here we go.
Oh, that's nice.
Gee!
Hey, Santa, you put on a little weight, didn't you?
How about you?
Yeah.
How about you, Ethel?
Fred, where'd you ever find such a big pillow?
Huh?
Why aren't you answering me?
I'm not wearing a pillow.
Oh!
Come on, let's open all our presents.
All right.
Okay.
Oh, no, no, let's sing first.
Sing?
Sing?
Sing?
Well, yeah.
Everything is so wonderful, and spending Christmas with our good friends I just feel like serenading the world.

Go ahead, sing it.
All right.
Cascabeles, cascabeles Cantan todo el dÃ­a Cascabeles, cascabeles Traen la alegria Hey!

{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Mm that was good, Lucy.
Want some more?
I have eight or nine pieces left in the kitchen.
No, three's my limit.
Ha!
Well, I guess I'd better go put on a new face.
Yeah, me too.
Say, did you see that little polka-dot dress at Orbach's?
The one with the white, ruffled collar?
Wasn't that the cutest thing you've ever seen?
What's that for?
Well, I'm always hoping that this time will be the charm.
What do you mean?
Ethel keeps going out to put on a new face but she always comes back with the old one.
Well, you know how women are.
Yeah.
If Lucy doesn't have any lipstick on, she thinks she's naked.
"Niked"?
Yeah, you know- not wearing a thing.
A thin what?
Clothes, clothes, clothes.
"Niked"- not wearing no thin clothes.
Nah, me either.
Uh-huh, same old one.
Same old one here, too.
What are they talking about?
I don't know, but whatever it is, ours aren't young enough.
We were just teasing you, honey, because you said you were going to go in and put on a new face, and you didn't.
Oh, Ethel, did you ever wish there was something else to marry besides men?
Often.
Well, what are we gonna do tonight besides sit around and sneer at each other?
Shall I look in the paper?
Yeah.
I better call Jerry.
Wouldn't it be quicker to look in the paper?
This is for something else.
Oh.
I'm having some trouble finding some apache dancers for my show.
Apache dancers?
Yeah.
Lucy.
Lucy!
What?
Not that kind, honey.
It's for the Parisian number.
Oh.
The French kind.
A French Indian?
Oui, oui.
Oui, oui Oui, oui No, no, Lucy.
You know, where the tough Frenchman grabs the girl by the hair and throws her over his shoulder and slams her down on the floor and steps on her.
Oh!
Oh.
Wait.
Oh!
Ah-ah-ahhhh!
Lucy.
Lucy.
Lucy!
What?
I got your message.
You want to be in the show, right?
Right.
And you think you can do the dance, right?
Right.
Well, honey, you don't have to go into all this routines.
I don't?
No, honey.
All you have to do is just come out and ask me- "Ricky, can I be in the show"?
Really?
Of course.
Ricky, can I be in the show?
No.
Jerry.
You're mean.
You didn't even let me finish the audition.
Hold on a minute, Jerry, will you?
You give everybody else a chance What do you mean, "what's going on"?
My wife is acting crazy again, Jerry.
Now, look, you just hold on like I told you to do, Jerry- just wait a minute.
iAy, que barbaridad!
Relax, Lucy, relax.
Oh, he makes me so mad.
There are just two things keeping me from dancing in that show.
Your feet?
No.
A partner and some rehearsal.
It's a wonderful opportunity for somebody.
Even if you had a partner, Ricky wouldn't hire you.
Well, you heard what he said.
He's having trouble finding somebody.
Maybe if I had a partner and we were really good, Ricky couldn't turn me down.
It's a wonderful opportunity for somebody.
Yeah, but who?
Well Gee, I wonder what Fred Astaire is doing these days.
Lucy.
Coming.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi.
Uh  Something on your mind, Ethel?
No yes.
Well, that covers the territory pretty well.
Lucy, were you serious last night about finding that partner for the apache dance?
I certainly was.
Well, I've got him for you- Fred.
Fred!
Astaire!
Ta-da!
Oh, Mertz.
Now, Lucy, before you make up your mind, listen.
Fred used to be a headliner in vaudeville.
Why, he can dance circles around any of the younger men today.
He's the king of the apache dancers.
There, I said it.
Do I get my new hat?
Yes.
Well, thanks a lot, Fred, but I don't think Oh, now, listen, Lucy.
He's really not half bad.
He might work out fine.
Why don't you give him a chance?
Yeah.
Well, all right.
I suppose a fat apache is better than none.
Okay, you're on your own.
See you later.
Bye.
Now we can start rehearsing, huh?
Oh, all right.
Now, let's get going.
Well, I don't know much about this, but Well, I'm gonna show you- now, here.
Put your hands together behind your back.
Put 'em up a little higher.
Now turn around.
Now Now we face each other and look in each other's eyes.
Where are you?
I'm down here.
Well, it's impossible to look into each other's eyes.
No, it isn't; we've got to do it.
All apache dancers do it.
Now, you come down a little and I'll come up.
All right.
Hey whoa right in there.
Hold that.
Yeah.
Now we put our heads together.
Now stare in each other's eyes.
All right.
Now we go forward.
Okay.
Are you ready?
Yep.
Da, da, da, de-  Forward, I said forward.
I went forward.
I mean I go forward and you go backward.
Well, why didn't you say that?
I did.
You did not.
Now, don't argue with me.
I'm the one who knows about this.
All right.
Oh, come on, let's try it again.
Put your hands behind your back.
All right.
Now, turn around.
Now, put our heads together.
All right.
Look in each other's eyes.
Okay.
Now, are you ready?
Yeah.
Da, da, da Da, da, da, da da, da dum- bam Da, da, da Da, da, da, da da, da dum- bam  Oh, Fred, I'm sorry.
You're sorry.
Yeah, that helps a lot.
Fred, I'll be careful next time.
Try it yourself this time, will you?
All right.
All right, now, put your hands behind your back.
All right.
All right, now.
Stand still, will you?
All right, yeah.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Da, da, da Da, da, da, da da, da dum- bam Da, da, da Da, da, da, da da, da dum- bam  I guess I dah-ed when I should have dum-ed.
Yeah.
Oh, Fred, I'm sorry.
You're sorry and I'm crippled.
Oh, come on, let's go on from here.
Let's try something else.
Okay.
Here.
Now I grab you by the wrist and hurl you to the floor.
What?
I grab you by the wrist and hurl you to the floor.
Okay.
I said I grab you by the wrist and hurl you to the floor.
Okay.
What's the matter with you?
Are you nailed down?
Well, Fred, maybe you weren't doing it right.
Now, you said you take me by the wrist and you hurl me to the floor.
Is that what you mean?
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
But there's a little bug in it someplace.
We've got to figure out how to get you down here and me up there.
Lucy!
What?
Lucy, I've got the most wonderful news.
What?
Well, this is going to cost me a new hat, but I found the perfect partner for you.
Really?
Who?
I'm sorry, Fred, but I'm about to dethrone you as king of the apache dancers.
You're a little late.
I've just abdicated.
Who was it?
The owner of the French laundry has a nephew who just got here from Paris, and he's an apache dancer.
Really?
What's his name?
His name is- now, I want to say it just like he did- his name is Jean-Valjean Raymond.
: Onh?
Jean-Valjean Raymond.
Onh.
Onh.
I asked him to come over here this afternoon.
Is that all right?
Yeah, that's wonderful.
Ricky will be at rehearsal all day.
Oh, I envy you spending all afternoon with a romantic Frenchman.
Oh, Ethel, don't be silly.
This is strictly business.
Onh?
Onh.
Madame Ricardo?
Yes?
I am Jean-Valjean Raymond.
Oh!
Won't you come in, please?
It was so good of you to come this afternoon.
What's the matter?
Oh, madame.
But you have such a beautiful hand!
Oh, really?
Well, I have another one just like it.
Please, we better get to the dancing.
Oh, but you don't understand, madame.
The apache dance is a dance of amour.
One must warm up to it.
Yeah, well, I think you started warming up on the way over here.
I can't help it.
There's a pounding in my heart.
You don't watch out, there'll be a pounding on your head.
Lucy, Ricky's coming.
Ricky?
!
I just saw him coming up the front stairs.
Oh, no!
Quickly, quickly!
Vite?
My husband.
Oh, vite!
Here, here.
Hi, honey.
Oh!
Oh, hello, Ricky.
What are you doing here?
I live here, remember?
I mean, what are you doing home in the afternoon?
Oh, I forgot this music, honey.
I need it for rehearsal.
Oh, gee, it's a shame you can't stay for a minute.
Oh, I guess I can stay a minute or two.
Oh, no, no, you better go.
What's the matter with you?
Well, I guess I'm just excited because you're h- home in the afternoon.
Well!
If you're going to get that excited, I should never leave.
I'll see you tonight.
Oh, good-bye, dear.
I better get my hat; it looks like rain.
Oh, I'll get it, I'll get it.
All right, thank you.
There.
Thank you, honey.
Maybe I should take an umbrella, too.
Oh, I'll get it, I'll get it.
No, I guess not.
Still, I hate to get soaked on the way down to the club.
Ah, the heck with it.
I'll see you tonight, honey.
Is he gone?
Huh?
Your husband, is he gone?
Oh, yes, he's gone.
Oh, ma cherie, now I know how you really feel about me.
Kiss me!
No!
Why are you American women so stubborn?
Why are you Frenchmen so amorous?
I don't know.
Just fortunate, I guess.
Kiss me.
No!
But if all you wanted me was to dance with you, why did you hide me from your husband?
Because I want to get a job dancing in his show and I don't want him to know that I'm rehearsing with you.
Am I not romantic to you?
Yes, you are not romantic to me.
Now, please go.
Very well.
I shall go.
Thank goodness.
But I shall return and I shall look for ways to make myself more romantic in your beautiful, big, blue eyes.
Vive la romance.
Well!
What are you doing, dear?
Oh, just getting comfortable.
Put your shoe back on.
I promised the Mertzes we'd go to the movies with them tonight.
They'll be up in a few minutes.
Oh all right.
Lucy?
Yes, dear, you have to shave.
Shave, shave, shave.
All this shaving is liable to wear my chin away.
Okay, Andy Gump.
Shh!
shh!
What are you doing here?
Oh, this is more romantic.
We will elope together.
Elope?
Are you out of your mind?
Now, get out of here.
No, please don't.
Oh!
What happened?
The ladder- she went down without me.
Fine, now what are you going to do?
Lucy?
Shh!
Lucy?
What is it?
!
No hot water again.
Did you tell Ethel to fix the hot- water heater?
Yes, I talked to her.
Well, she better fix it or I'm going to move.
I cut myself to pieces in here.
Feels like I shaved with the top of a tin can.
Tin can?
Yeah.
You know, it wouldn't be such a bad idea to move, at that.
How would you like to live in the country and commute?
Oh, I'd like that.
Uh, honey, you'd better go get your shirt on.
The Mertzes will be here any minute.
Oh, we have lots of time.
Want a cigarette?
Yeah, light it for me, dear.
All right.
Hey, look at me.
I'm making like Paul Henreid.
Uh, put it in my mouth, dear.
Do you want me to smoke it for you?
You know, living in the country wouldn't be a bad idea at all with the trees and the flowers the birds singing tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet, tweet-tweet.
Tweet-tweet.
Where would you like to live, Long Island or Westchester?
Westchester.
Yeah, you know, it would be real wonderful to be away from the crowd and the noise and the nightclubs.
And the smoke.
We could get a place in New Jersey.
That's nice  What's that?
Hey, there's a man out here!
Hey, hold it now.
Hold on.
I'll get Hold on, now, hold on.
Oh, thank you, monsieur.
I thought I was going to fall.
Who are you, and what are you doing outside that window?
Yeah, how about that?
My ladder fell.
I came here to elope with madame.
Elope!
What's going on here?
How can you say a thing like that?
What do you mean you came here?
Please, please, this is no time to argue.
If we stay here much longer, her stupid husband will return and find us here.
Watch what you're saying!
He's my stupid husband!
He's my husband.
All right, you, now you tell me what's going on or I'll punch you right in the nose.
Don't try to get away, you gigolo!
Gigolo!
I am very insulted.
I challenge you to a duel.
A duel!
You got yourself a deal, brother.
Very well.
Tomorrow at dawn behind Radio City Music Hall.
What do you mean, "tomorrow at dawn behind Radio City Music Hall"?
Right now- I'm ready now.
Very well.
I challenge you.
You choose the weapons.
These are good enough for me, brother.
Put 'em up.
Come on.
Ricky, Ricky.
Please, please, please- too crude.
Very vulgar.
It must be pistols.
"Pee-stoles"?
Who's got any "pee-stoles"?
I'll hit you on top of the head with a conga drum, you bum.
Qu'est-ce que c'est "conga drum, you bum"?
Well, it's a long and it's and you It'll hurt you.
It must be pistols.
Where are we going to get pistols?
I have such a terrible temper that I always carry with me dueling pistols.
Oh, no.
Oh, no!
Okay, that's good enough for me.
Ricky, you don't know what you're doing.
Come on, honey, this is liable to be a bit messy.
Ricky, I'm not worth it.
I'm not worth it.
Out.
I'm not worth it.
Out!
Out!
All right, I'm ready.
Where did you go?
Hey, Frenchy!
All right.
Please, put that thing away before you kill somebody.
You mean we're not going to duel?
I hope not.
Whew!
That's the closest I've ever been to a duel in my whole life.
Me, too.
What do you mean, "me, too"?
It was a bum steer.
I was told that it was safe to challenge people over here because American men would be afraid to duel.
American men, eh?
I guess I fooled you with my Brooklyn accent, eh?
I guess I made what you call a boo-boo.
I guess you did.
What about all this stuff about eloping with my wife?
Is that another, uh boo-boo?
Oh, super-size.
I was also told that American women expect Frenchmen to be romantic.
I have a wife and five children of my own.
Then what are you doing here?
I came here to be your wife's dance partner in the apache dance.
Oh.
Ohhh Oh, I smell a red-headed rat.
I tell you what we're going to do, amigo.
This thing loaded?
But yes.
Ay!
We're going to teach my wife a lesson she will never forget.
You and I are going to do Well, we're ready to go to the movies.
Lucy  what's the matter?
They're in there.
They're going to fight a duel.
A duel!
Yes!
Who's dueling?
Did he come back?
Yes!
Who's dueling?
How did it happen?
He called him a gigolo.
Who's dueling?
Swords?
Pistols.
Who's dueling?
Ricky and Jean-Valjean Raymond.
All four of them?
Oh, no.
Sorry, madame, c'est la vie.
Is he?
Oh, Ricky!
Don't, madame.
It isn't a pretty sight.
Oh, this is all my fault.
I killed him.
Oh, you poor little thing.
No, you didn't.
He did.
You you crepe suzette.
If I hadn't wanted to do that apache dance, this never would have happened.
Oh, if I only had it to do over again, I'd just be happy being Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Oh, Ethel, if I only had another chance.
All right I'll give you one more chance.
Ricky!
Ricky, you're all right.
Oh, sure I'm all right.
Honey, what happened?
We both made a boo-boo.
Oh, yoo-hoo.
Vive la romance.
Oh, honey, you should have seen your face when I popped out of that room.
Well, you scared me out of ten years' growth.
Oh, well, honey, I just wanted to teach you a lesson.
That's all.
Yeah, I guess I had it coming to me.
Well, good night, baby.
Good night, sweetheart.
Hey!
what's that for?
!
Well, I've just been thinking it over.
That wasn't funny at all.
That was a terrible thing to do to me.
How could you play such a dirty trick when you know the effect it would have on me?
Of all the inconsiderate, no-good, lowdown I don't think that I'll ever speak to you again.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Ha, ha, that's it, partner.
Game and rubber.
How do you like that, Ricky?
We didn't take a single trick.
Yeah.
Fortunately, you only bid six spades- double.
Oh When I was leading diamonds and you didn't have any diamonds, why didn't you play trumps?
I didn't have any trumps.
I thought you knew that.
Why do you think I was kicking you under the table?
You didn't kick me.
Well, then, who did I kick?
Is there any liniment in the house?
Oh, Fred, I'm sorry.
I didn't know I was kicking you.
Oh, I rather enjoyed it.
I thought we were playing shinsies.
Well, here it is.
and 73 points for you.
Let's see, you owe us 14,000 at, uh let's see five and carry two Pay them, Ricky.
I'll get my purse.
Yeah, I've been sitting still too long I'll tell you that.
Oh, I have, too.
"Shine On Harvest Moon"- what are you doing with this old tune, Ricky?
Oh, we're doing it in the show.
You know, an old-fashioned June moon number.
Yeah?
Here, sit down.
Oh, sing, Ricky.
All right.
Oh, shine on  Shine on harvest moon Up in the sky I ain't had no loving Since January, February, June or July Hey, Fred, you're pretty good.
Aw, sure he is.
Let's take it from the top again.
All right.
Oh, shine on, shine on, harvest moon, up in the sky I ain't had no loving  Since January, February, June or July Show time ain't no time To stay outdoors And spoon Shine on Hold it, hold it!
Hold it.
Somebody's singing off key.
Yeah, watch that, will you?
Somebody's singing off key.
Well, who was it?
Who was it?
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Ahh.
Fred?
Ahh.
Ethel?
Ahh.
Lucy?
: Ahh.
At ease, mounties, we found our man.
You have not.
I hit the right note.
The piano needs tuning.
Oh, honey, why don't you just go and sit down and listen to the rest of us, huh?
No, either we all sing or nobody sings.
Well, all right then.
If nobody wants to sing, I'll just sing by myself.
No!
Well, of all the insulting Now, honey, come on.
Fix us a snack, huh?
I'm hungry.
No, you can't insult me and then expect me to feed you.
Oh, honey.
Come on, Fred, let's see what's out there.
Coming, maestro.
Oh, dear, I might just as well fix it for them- they'll just get the kitchen all messy.
No, wait a minute, Lucy, I want to talk to you.
What about?
Well, come sit down.
You got to help me.
My women's club wants Ricky.
Well, I'd be very glad to help them out, Ethel, but I'm not through with him yet.
No, I didn't mean that.
I mean, we want him to sing at a benefit my club is giving next week, and I can't get up the nerve to ask him.
You ask him.
Well how would you like to have the both of us?
Is that the only way we can get Ricky?
Never mind that.
Do you want us or don't you?
Well all right.
Do you think you can get him to do it?
Sure, if I wheedle him.
How soon?
I got to have the posters printed and the signs made for the front of the theater, you know.
You go ahead and have them made, I'll work on Ricky.
I'll start on him tonight just as soon as you and Fred leave.
Oh, good, we'll go right now.
Fred?
Come on, it's getting late.
We gotta go.
But I'm hungry.
Oh, come on.
You can live off of that till breakfast.
Thanks, Lucy, for a lovely evening.
Good-bye.
Straighten it up in the morning, honey.
Okay, dear.
Anything you say.
Hi.
Hello.
You know, I was watching you tonight.
You're cute.
Thank you.
You sure look handsome in that smoking jacket.
I do?
Yeah I love you.
Lucy, what do you want?
Nothing, I just love you, that's all.
Well, that's nice.
Do you love me?
Sure, I love you.
Would you climb the highest mountain for me?
Uh-huh.
Would you swim the widest ocean?
Yeah.
Would you do anything in the world for me?
Yup- anything but sing at Ethel's club next week.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And who told you?
Fred told me.
Oh, that big blabbermouth.
All right, if that's the way you feel about it, I'll just tell Ethel we can't make it.
What did you say?
I said, I'll just tell Ethel that we can't make it.
What do you mean "we"?
Well, for your information, Ethel asked me to appear at that benefit, too.
I thought perhaps we could sing a duet together.
Oh, no.
Oh, Ricky, wouldn't you do it for me?
No.
But I can't No.
No!
Lucy, I am not going to appear at that benefit.
Do you understand?
And I don't want to hear another word about it, right?
That's better.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Now, Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy All right, honey, all right.
All right, I'll do it with you.
You will?
Yes, I will.
I have an arrangement that you might be able to do.
I'll bring it home tomorrow night and we can rehearse it.
Oh, Ricky, you're wonderful!
Mmm!
LUCY : Ahh.
Ahh.
Ahh.
Ahh.
Hi, honey, I forgot my key.
Where's the song, where's the song?
Is this it?
That's the song.
Ha-ha!
"Auf Wiedersehen"?
That's a nice Cuban melody.
Well, I thought it would be very good for you.
Well, come on, let's try it.
All right.
Here, give me that.
This is your part, and this is mine.
All of this is mine?
Yeah.
Oh, honey, that isn't fair to you.
Well, sweetheart, you are the star.
So you sing all the words that are written on your music, and I'll sing everything on mine.
Okay.
All right?
Are you ready?
Yep.
Okay, let's try it.
Come, let us stroll down lovers' lane Once more to sing love's old refrain Soon we must say Auf Wiedersehen Auf Wiedersehen, my dear.
Here in your arms I can't remain So let me kiss you once again Soon we must say Auf Wiedersehen Auf Wiedersehen, my dear.
Your love will cling to me Through the lonely daytime Each night will bring to me The magic memory of Maytime.
I know my heart won't beat again Until the day we meet again Sweetheart, good-bye Auf Wiedersehen Auf Wiedersehen, my dear.
What's the matter?
Didn't you like the song?
Auf!
What's wrong with it?
I sound like a hungry seal.
Honey, don't be silly.
The audience will love us.
Well, they might love you, but they're going throw me a fish.
Ricky Ricardo, you bring me another song.
Well, I am very sorry, honey, but that is the only song that I have that will fit your voice.
We'll just have to forget all about the benefit.
Well, you look again, you'll be able to find me one.
No, I wan't.
Not much you want.
You find me another song tomorrow or just dun't come home.
Auf!
Auf!
Hey, Lucy, look.
Isn't this wonderful?
Look at that.
Pretty good, huh?
Lucy?
What's the matter?
Lucy?
Ricky did say he'd do it, didn't he?
Lucy?
This is the right name, isn't it?
Well, yes, with one minor change: Mrs. Ricky Ricardo!
Oh, no and the show's tonight.
You were so sure you could wheedle him.
So you can't get Ricky.
You still have me.
After all, what's Ricky got that I haven't got, except a band, a reputation And talent.
Well, now, let's not be unkind.
Do you want me or don't you?
Oh, I don't know.
It's too late to have any new posters printed and you are Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, but it's like expecting Clark Gable and getting Hubert Grimset.
Hubert Grimset?
I never heard of him.
Exactly.
Well, you must admit, I'm better than nothing.
There you've got me.
Just what were you intending to do in this show tonight?
Well, I'm not sure.
I could sing.
But I'm not going to by popular demand.
I could dance, but I don't have a partner.
Oh, dear.
Oh I know!
Ricky's got a closet full of costumes left from his shows.
I'll find one that fits me and I'll build a whole act around it.
Oh, let me help you.
Haven't you ever seen this stuff in here?
No.
Ohh!
What a treasure trove.
There's more stuff in there than you can shake a stick at.
Hey, here's a clown suit.
This might do.
Let's see.
You'll get a lot of laughs with that.
I'll say I will.
Oh, moths.
Yeah.
Hey, what's this?
I don't know.
Why it's half half a horse.
Say, those moths were hungrier than I thought.
Hey, look, here's the rest of it.
Oh, Ethel!
This is it, this is it!
We'll do a horse act.
But it takes two people to do a horse act.
Well, what are you doing tonight?
Me?
I'm the chairman.
So?
I guess I could.
Yeah, come on, let's try it on.
Okay.
Lucy!
Ethel!
Now!
Ethel!
Oh That's your half right there.
No, sir, that's your half.
Ethel, now let's be sensible about this.
Who's the big name in this twosome?
I'm Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Listen, Lucy, when you're inside a horse, it doesn't matter if you're Mrs. Hubert Grimset.
I'm only doing this benefit for you.
I should think you could do this one little thing for me.
Listen, Lucy, even for sweet charity, I am not going to be the back end of a horse.
Ethel, now, be sensible.
Who's going to recognize you?
You just said so yourself.
Well Come on, now try it on.
Why do these things always happen to me?
Take off your shoes.
Take off my shoes?
Yes.
You have to step into this thing.
This is the front.
That's right.
Into the feet?
Yeah.
Now, I'll hold onto you.
Oh, if my family in Albuquerque could see me, they'd die of shame.
Speaking of Albuquerque- is it true that your father drinks goat's milk?
I only hope this fit the horse better than it does me.
Turn around now.
That's it.
There.
There, that looks wonderful!
Are you sure nobody can tell who I am?
I defy anybody to recognize you.
Hi, Lucy.
I got something for you.
Hello, Fred.
Hello, Ethel.
What did I tell you?
Oh, now, Ethel Fred had to know that was you in that costume, didn't you Fred?
What costume?
That's all, brother- count me out.
Oh, Ethel!
Oh, no.
Oh, Ethel!
Nothing doing.
Lucy, I stopped by the club, and Ricky asked me to bring you this.
Music?
It's the number he's going to do with you tonight at Ethel's benefit.
Oh, Ethel, he's going to do it!
Thank goodness.
He wants you to look it over, and he'll join you there later.
He's bringing the costumes.
Oh, wonderful.
"Underneath the Bamboo Tree.
" Oh, Ethel, this is that cute song and dance number that Ricky had in the show last year.
I know it backwards.
Da-da da-da, da-da Da-da da-da, da-da What's all this?
Oh, those are jokes- Ricky's got a cane that he taps on the floor with when he wants the music to stop  And you tell one of these jokes.
Oh, good, I love to tell jokes.
Hey, rehearse them with me, will you, Fred?
Why, sure I will.
Dya-dya dya-dya, dya-dya Tap, tap, tap.
Hi, Lucy.
Hiya, Ricky.
You know, a funny thing happened to me on the way to the theater this evening.
What?
Well, a tramp come up to me in the street and told me that he hadn't had a bite in weeks.
What did you do?
I bit him.
Oh, brother.
You keep out of this, Whirlaway.
Come on, let's get to my jokes.
Da-da da-da, da-da.
Tap, tap, tap.
Did you hear No, no, no, I forgot to tell you- that's Ricky's line.
Did you hear about the big fire down at the shoe factory?
What happened?
Ho, ho, ho- what a boffola.
He must be saving the good jokes for me.
Tap, tap, tap.
You know, there are two things Wo, wo, wo That's Ricky's line, too.
Oh, I was afraid of that.
You know, there are two things that I can't Wait a minute.
Who does he think he is?
He's got all the funny lines for himself.
Well, I'm not going to do it with him.
Oh, now, Lucy.
If you don't do it, Ricky won't.
Well, I don't care.
Oh, Lucy, I never thought I'd live to ask this question, but will you please sing at our benefit tonight?
No.
Oh, please.
No.
I'll be in such a mess.
I told all the women Wait a minute, wait a minute, I got an idea.
Okay, I'll do it.
Good.
You two skedaddle.
I have a little studying to do.
Oh, come on, Fred.
Let's leave her while she's All right, all right.
Tap, tap, tap.
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Thompson, thank you.
And now, club members and guests comes the piece de resistance- that means the best part of the evening- Mr. And Mrs. Ricky Ricardo in "Songs and Witty Sayings.
"  We'll build a bungalow big enough for two Big enough for two My honey!
Yes, me and you Ha, ha, ha, ha And when we're married Happy we'll be Under the bamboo Underneath the bamboo tree.
Say, Lucy?
Yeah, Ricky.
You know, a funny thing happened to me on the way to the theater tonight.
What?
A tramp came up to me in the street and said he hadn't had a bite in weeks.
What'd you do, bite him?
If you'd be M- i-n-e, mine, I'll be t-h-i-n-e, thine And I'll I-o-v-e, love you all the t- i-m-e, time.

How many wheels does it have?
Oh, what's the use.
And when we're married, happy we'll be Under the bamboo Under the bamboo tree.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Oh Oh, brother, am I beat.
Well, what a sale, huh?
Oh, these little piggies may never go to market again.
Wouldn't you know I wouldn't be able to find anything and you got the cutest dress in town.
Truthfully, Ethel, isn't this the biggest bargain you've ever seen?
Absolutely.
Oh course, now it's a question of how to get Ricky to let me keep it.
Oh, he'll have to let you keep it.
You got it at a sale; they won't take it back.
Yeah, well, that's the gamble I'm taking.
I have to get Ricky to say that I can keep it without letting him know that even if he says I can't keep it, I'll have to keep it because the store will make me keep it anyway.
Well, that ought to confuse him enough.
Oh, I guess I'll be able to smooch him into it.
Sure.
Well, I'll just get this out of his sight until I get him good and mellow and then I'll spring it on him.
Well, I guess I'll go down and smooch Fred and see if I can talk him into letting me keep this.
So long, Lucy.
Good-bye, dear.
Is that you, Ricky?
Yeah, honey.
Hello, baby!
Hi.
Ho-ho.
Your cheeks are cold.
Oh, let me take off your coat, honey.
Are your feet wet?
No.
Well, sit down, darling, you must be awfully tired.
Put the tootsies up.
That's a boy.
There you are.
Oh, you great, big, handsome husband, you.
Mmm Lucy.
Yes, dear.
What have you done?
Nothing, I'm just glad that I have the cutest, sweetest, most wonderful husband in the whole wide world.
Kiss me.
You have something to tell me.
What is it?
Well, I don't think you're ready for it yet.
I know!
You bought something!
Boy, am I losing my touch.
How much is it going to cost me?
Now, Ricky, don't get mad till I show it to you.
You've got to agree it's a bargain.
Isn't it the cutest thing you've ever seen?
How much?
Notice the full skirt and the sensational neckline?
How much?
Isn't it a divine color, Ricky?
How much?
Of course, I'll have to shorten it a little.
How much?
!
About 2?
inches.
I'll have that done tomorrow.
Let me see that, let me see that.
?
Este vestidito?
?
Esta cochita tan flaquita?
?
Este pedacito de tela?
$59.95!
Y despues de todo eso hay que pagar tambien, plus sales tax!
Well, that means you like it, doesn't it?
Now, Lucy, you don't need that dress.
You got plenty of clothes.
No, I haven't.
I looked in my closet this morning and you know what?
I haven't a thing to wear.
I haven't a thing to wear.
Well, I haven't.
Honey, you got a closet full of clothes.
Well, all my friends have seen me in them.
Well, then get yourself a new set of friends.
Very funny.
Look, honey, I'm not going to pay for that dress.
Then I will!
All right, you pay for it.
I'm not going to stand here and argue.
I got to get dressed to go to the show.
She's going to pay for it.
Well, I will!
I'll show you, I'll get a job!
Job?
You?
Ha!
I could make money if I wanted to.
Where are you ever get a job?
How about using me in your club as a singer?
As a dancer?
Chorus girl?
Parking cars?
Oh See you later, honey.
Ricky!
Where are you going?
Going down to the club.
Well, put some clothes on!
Well, I'd love to, honey, but, uh, I haven't a thing to wear.
Oh Good morning, Lucy.
Lucy?
Well, this is a switch.
Lucy, I haven't got any breakfast.
It's on the stove.
Get it yourself.
Now, Lucy Listen, I am no longer the doting housewife.
If you are going to send me out into the world of business to earn my own money you can just treat me like a fellow businessman.
All right, fellow businessman.
Hey, pardon me, will you pass the sugar, mister?
Any good jobs open, mac?
Lots of them.
I just have to take my choice.
Stenographer.
Nah.
Bookkeeper.
Nah.
Cook.
No!
Lady wrestler.
Hmm Oh, this is terribly unfair.
What is?
Well, apparently, you can't get a job in this town unless you can do something.
Yeah, how about that?
Well, good-bye, fellow worker.
Good-bye.
Oh, listen, honey, I won't be home till late tonight.
Jerry has me booked in some charity affair or something.
Okay.
I'll see you later, bye.
Bye.
Good morning, Lucy.
Hi.
Well, how did you make out last night?
Did you get to keep the dress?
I can keep it if I pay for it.
I'm going to get a job.
Job?
You?
Ha!
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
There's a lot of things in here that I can do.
What, for instance?
Well, I could be a um Well, I could I could be a baby-sitter.
Yeah.
Oh Gee, it's disgusting the measly wages they pay baby-sitters.
At that rate it would take you a year to pay for that dress.
Look at that- "Baby-sitter, 50 cents an hour.
"Baby-sitter, 50 cents an hour.
"Baby-sitter, $50 an Five dollars an hour"!
Oh, that must be a misprint.
No, it isn't, right there- "Baby-sitter, five dollars an hour.
" I'm going to call up and see if that's right.
Susquehanna seven Listen, Lucy, if they're willing to pay five dollars an hour for a baby-sitter, there's a catch in it someplace.
I don't care.
I wonder what kind of a baby it could be?
Listen, for five dollars an hour I'll sit with a baby gorilla.
Hello?
Hello, I'm calling about your ad in the paper.
Five dollars an hour for baby-sitting, is that correct?
Well, why do you pay so much?
I mean, what kind of a baby is it?
A little boy.
A little boy what?
I mean, is it human?
What is it?
It's all right, it's just a little boy.
There's something fishy!
Yes, yes, yes, you can bring him around this afternoon.
The name is Mrs. Ricardo, 623 east About 2:00?
Fine.
All right, good-bye.
Just think, Ethel, if she leaves him here four hours this afternoon, I'll make $20.
If you're still alive.
Oh, don't be so pessimistic.
It's just a little boy.
Now, what do you think I better have ready for him when he gets here?
A little girl.
Mrs. Ricardo?
Mrs. Hudson?
Yes.
Oh, come in, please.
Thank you.
This must be your little boy.

Ahh!

I made a mistake!
Okay!

Over there.
Sit down.
Oh, my, look at those dirty hands!

I don't want to.
You go into the living room, into the bathroom and wash your hands!
Now, go on.
Aw Aww I said go wash your hands!

They're clean!
What kind of a nitwit do you think I am?
I don't know, what kind are you?
Well, they're clean.
I don't know how you did it so fast but come on.
What's that for?
You said you were hungry!
You already gave me some of those lousy cookies.
Well, I know Guess you're having a hard time getting rid of them, aren't you?
That does it, all right, into the living room we'll play games, I'll be in.
Well?
Well, what?
Where's my cookies and milk?
You said you didn't want any.
You won't give me any cookies and milk!

Do I get my cookies and milk?
Are you sure this time?
Sure, I'm sure!
All right, sit down!
What's the matter, what's the matter?
You scared me.
How did you get out there?
I walked out.
But you were   Quit scaring me!
Now, listen, that's a very funny trick, that disappearing, but don't you do it again, see.
I thought you said we were going to play games.
All right.
What kind of a game do you want to play?
How about cowboys and Indians?
What?
Cowboys!
And Indians!
Why, what a dirty trick!
Why didn't your mother tell me you were twins?
Because nobody will baby-sit with us when she does.
Yeah, one of us is bad enough, but two of us- mur-der!
You can say that again.
Come on, let's play cowboys and Indians.
Well, now that I know I'm sane, I guess can face anything.
We'll be the Indians and you'll be the cowboy, and we'll burn you at the stake.
Burn me at the stake?
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, let's find another game.
What about "here we go round the maypole"?
Well, that sounds tame enough.
I saw a rope we can use on the	back porch.
Be careful, now.
Don't fall off.
Ah Say, is all this red stuff real?
Well, it should be!
I paid enough for it.
Here's the rope, Tim.
All right, stand up.
Boy, this is going to be fun.
You hold the middle of the rope 'cause you're the maypole.
Okay.
Here we go round the maypole, the maypole, the maypole Here we go round the maypole, na, na, na, na, na, na Here we go round the maypole, the maypole, the maypole Here we go round the maypole, na, na, na, na, na.
We'll start a fire and burn her at the stake!
Yeah, these papers will burn swell.
Fellas, you're kidding, I hope!
Fellas!
Help!
You gag her, I'll get the stake.
Help!
How, me get matches.
How, paleface get um hot seat.
Hello.
Hello, hello, Jimmy?
Or is it Timmy?
Let me speak to Mrs. Ricardo.
She can't talk now.
Timmy, is Mrs. Ricardo on fire?
Not yet.
Well, it's a good thing for you she isn't!
You know your father said he would spank you both if you burn just one more sitter at the stake!
Now, you let me talk to her!
Oh, all right.
Mom wants to talk to you.
Take the gag out.
Hello.
Hello!
Oh, well, you found out my little joke.
Oh, listen, now, I'm all tied up.
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.
Uh, I wonder, Mrs. Ricardo if you would take my place with the boys at the amateur contest tonight.
What?
If you win, I'll let you keep the prize money- $100.
$100?
Well Oh, thank you, Mrs. Ricardo.
I don't I didn't Hello?
Hello?
Okay, boys, meet the new partner in your act.
You're going to do the act instead of Mom?
Yeah, but I have a hunch I'd be better off if I just let you burn me at the stake.
Untie me!
Very, very fine.
Wasn't that fine?
That was little, uh uh, Willie May, little Willie May, who played the guitar with her feet.
Well, I'll try playing the guitar with my hands.
She probably does better with her feet.

{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Come in!
Good morning, Mrs. Ricardo.
Good morning, Miss Lewis.
Come in.
Oh, thank you.
How's everything down in your apartment?
Oh, fine, fine.
Help yourself to a cup of coffee.
Oh, I'd like some.
It's chilly out.
Yes, it is.
Mrs. Ricardo.
Mrs. Ricardo : Mrs. Ricardo, could I speak Oh.
Could I speak to you for a minute?
Oh, surely, what's on your mind?
Well, I, um I wanted to ask you a big favor.
It's about a, hmm m- a-n.
M- a-n?
Oh, a man.
Ooh, shh!
Well, is it any special m-a-n?
It's mister, um Ritter.
Mr. Ritter, the grocery man?
Oh, why, Miss Lewis, I believe you're blushing.
I know, I know.
Oh, oh, Mrs. Ricardo, I don't mind telling you that as far as I'm concerned, Mr. Ritter is the bee's knees.
What's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
It's just that I never expected you to think things like that.
Ooh, ooh, I do!
Well, you know the old saying "Just because there's snow on the roof doesn't mean there's no fire in the furnace.
" Well, well, well, here this big romance is going on between you and Mr. Ritter and I never knew about it.
There's somebody else that doesn't know about it.
Who?
Mr. Ritter.
Mr. Ritter?
To Mr. Ritter, I'm just a box of groceries twice a week.
Oh well, why don't you do something about it?
I'm going to, I'm going to.
I want to invite him to a little intimate supper for two in my apartment.
Oh.
Oh, but I need your help.
Oh, what do you want me to do, hold him for you?
Oh, no, no, no!
I want you to give him this.
It's oh, it's a little dirty.
I've been carrying it around for five years.
Five years?
I've been carrying the blowtorch for Mr. Ritter for five years.
Well, I better give this to him today.
Is breakfast ready?
Oh, hello, Mrs. Lewis.
Good morning, Mr. Ricardo.
Good morning.
Oh, well I guess I'll be running along.
Toodle-oo!
Good-bye, dear.
Toodle-oo.
What's on Grandma Lewis's mind?
Listen, don't let Grandma Lewis fool you.
Yes, sir.
You never know what's in a box by the wrapper.
Well, really, I didn't even look at her wrapper.
I didn't mean that.
It's just an expression.
It means just because there isn't any fire on her roof that there is no snow in her furnace.
What?
Sounded better when she said it.
Yeah.
Honestly, Ricky, it's the cutest thing.
Miss Lewis has a crush on Mr. Ritter.
Mr. Ritter?
Yeah.
The grocery man?
Yeah.
And she is so bashful that she doesn't want to ask him up to supper, so I'm going to give him the invitation for her.
Uh-huh.
Give it to me, nosy.
Nosy?
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
How many times have I told you not to get involved in other people's lives?
But I'm just trying to help a sweet old lady.
They might even get married, and then they'll thank me.
Yeah, she'll thank you; he'll sue you.
Well, is that the way you feel about marriage?
Oh, honey, of course not.
I think marriage is wonderful.
Why, I think marriage is the greatest thing there is in the whole world.
It's the only way to live.
But if the guy has been clever enough to escape it this long why louse him up now?
What?
Honey, I didn't mean I suppose you weren't clever enough.
Well Well, honey, now I mean, uh Well, I could have been clever enough, but you were so cute, I decided to play dumb.
Well, all right, then, it's all settled.
I'll give this invitation to Mr. Ritter.
It's all settled; you'll do nothing of the kind.
What do you mean?
Are you going to give that invitation back to Mrs. Lewis or not?
No!
Lucy, if you're going to act like a child, I'm going to have to treat you like one.
Meaning what?
Meaning I'll put you over my knees You wouldn't dare!
Oh, I wouldn't?
No, you wouldn't!
Ricky, Ricky!
Come here.
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky!
Are you going to do what I say?
Oh, yes!
All right.
Oh, Ricky!
Oh, come in.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo!
Hello, Miss Lewis.
I was just ironing the dress I'm going to wear tonight.
Yeah, well, that's what I came down to talk to you about.
This isn't really the one that I wanted to wear at all.
I wanted to wear my good one, but it's in my hope chest and the lock is rusted shut.
Oh.
Well, it really won't make any difference because I'm Oh, of course it doesn't.
Sit down, dear.
No, I don't think I care to sit down.
Well, let me show you, here.
Now, look, I thought that we'd eat by candlelight, because they say it makes you look younger.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Maybe I'll look like a girl of 50 again, huh?
Oh, easily.
Oh, you're sweet, you're awfully sweet.
Look.
Elderberry wine- I made it myself.
It's been fermenting since I was 21 years old.
Twenty-one?
Must have quite a tang by now.
I thought Mr. Ritter and I could have a couple of belts before dinner.
Well, I don't think you're going to get much chance to serve it, Miss Lewis.
You see, I had a long talk with my husband  Oh, husband!
That's the most beautiful word in the English language.
Miss Lewis!
Don't forget the invitation!
I wanted to talk to you about that Pretty late today, and I'm awful sorry, but I want to tell you something.
The traffic has been something awful.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, howdy, howdy!
Awful cold out- it's awful cold, really.
How are you?
Fine.
How are you?
Me, I can't kick- rheumatism.
Get it?
I don't know how I think of them.
Just like that, you know, comical.
Where is, uh, where is Miss Lewis?
Well, she ought to be back in a minute.
Well, she can, uh She can pay me for these when I come the next time.
Okay.
Mr. Ritter?
Huh?
Come here.
I have a secret to tell you.
Uh Someone around here is very fond of you.
No!
Yes, a certain someone thinks that you're the bee's knees.
Well, hot diggity!
You want to know something, Mrs. Ricardo?
What?
I like you, too.
What?
You're just my type, Red.
Oh, no, no, you don't understand.
Here, read this.
This will explain.
"Can you make it for dinner tonight, just the two of us"?
Uh-oh.
"Will be waiting for you in my apartment.
" Can I make it?
Say, speed's my middle name, Lucy.
Oh, now, now, stay away!
I didn't write that note.
Miss Lewis did.
Miss Lewis?
Aw, who are you joshing?
No, really, look at the signature.
It says "Your secret lover.
" Secret lover?
You don't have to keep anything secret from me, lover.
No!
Miss Lewis!
Miss Lewis!
Now, listen, you're not fooling anybody.
She's not here, you said so yourself.
Don't try to fight this, Lucy.
It's bigger than both of us.
It is not!
Miss Lewis, Miss Lewis, where are you?
Miss Lewis!
See, alone.
I tell you it's fate, really.
But she was here, honest.
Sure, she was, sure.
You know you're even cuter when you get shy like this.
Mr. Ritter!
Don't worry about anything- your apartment, dinner, tonight, sure.
I'm afraid I can't make it till about half past 7:00.
Mr. Ritter!
Oh, honey, I got to keep the store open till 7:00, honest.
Mr. Ritter!
Oh, Miss Lewis, where have you been?
I've been calling you for hours.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, I just lost control of myself.
When I found out that Mr. Ritter thought you were inviting him to dinner, I got hysterical and started running.
Ran eight laps around the park.
Passed lots of horses.
Oh I'm pooped.
Well, you certainly got me in a fine mess.
Your secret lover is coming here for dinner at 7:30 and my husband is due home at the same time.
Oh well, why don't you call him and tell him your husband's going to be here?
I did- he was delighted.
He wants to tell Ricky that we love each other and that he should start getting a divorce right away.
Oh oh, I wish there was some way I could help.
There is.
What?
You stay on those stairs tonight and don't let Mr. Ritter get into this apartment.
You get him into your apartment.
How?
I don't know how you're going to do it, but you do it.
Mrs. Ricardo?
What?
Would you teach me how to attract the opposite sex?
Well, all right.
Stand up, let's have a look at you.
Well um, let's see you walk back and forth and swing your hips.
Swing my hips?
Yes.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
All that will get you is a Boy Scout to help you across the street.
Look, now, watch me.
You just shift them gently.
Shift, shift, shift shift, shift Shift them?
That's easy for you.
I've got a rusty transmission.
I'm sorry.
Maybe we could try a "come hither" look.
Yeah.
Miss Lewis, what's the matter?
Are you all right?
What's the matter?
There's nothing the matter.
That's my "come hither" look.
Oh.
Oh, no, dear, try something like this.
Oh, dear.
Oh, excuse me.
Hello.
Yes, dear?
It's Ricky.
Honey, I won't be home tonight for dinner.
Oh?
No, I have to stay in town.
Jerry and I are going to talk some business.
Oh, well, all right, dear.
Don't be too lonesome.
Oh, no, no, I won't.
Good-bye.
Ricky isn't coming home to dinner.
You know, I just think I might keep that date with Mr. Ritter tonight.
That's not fair.
He's mine.
Oh, you don't understand, dear.
I'm going to get him up here and disappoint him so completely that he wouldn't have me on a silver platter.
Then the road will be nice and clear for you.
Oh, oh, fine, fine.
Let's see now, how can I disappoint Mr. Ritter?
What do you know about him?
Well, we had a long conversation once over the pickle barrel.
That sort of raised my hopes.
Um he can't stand children.
And he likes a tidy appearance, and he demands immaculate housekeeping.
He likes good cooking Hold it, hold it.
I think I can change Mr. Ritter's heartthrob to heartburn in one sitting.
Well, Mr. Ritter!
How are you tonight?
You ask that at a time like this?
Oh, for me?
Uh-huh, the whole bag.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, gumdrops!
Thank you.
Can I take your coat off?
Please.
There we are.
Hat?
Oh.
Just a minute.
What's that?
Oh!
Well, sit down; dinner's almost ready.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm very anxious for you to sample my cooking.
So am I. Oh!
Oh!
Pardon me.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
There we are.
Well, I hope you like tomato juice.
Oh, I do, I like it very much.

This is our special every Thursday down at my store.
Oh, is that so?
Yeah, yes.
Well, the same brand it is, yes, sure.
Is that so?
Well, here's uh, what is it now?
Here's mud in your eye.

Of course, it ain't mud; it's really tomato juice.
Yeah.
You know, I put the tiniest dash of Tabasco in this.
Inside?
Yeah.
Yes, it helps, you know, everything, you know Just right, huh?
Oh, fine   Want some more?
No, something to chew on, like a piece of bread.
Oh, I have some nice, fluffy biscuits.

You been "specting" what?

Of course not.
I pass her on to you.
And you pass her into waiting hands.
Wait a minute.
Can the football say something?
Mr. Ritter, please be good to her.
She'll make a wonderful wife.

Good-bye- I'll pack my things.
Ricky!
Don't worry about him, don't- you got me.
Oh, wait a minute, leave me alone!
At last, at last you're altogether mine.
Mr. Ritter!
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you?
Lover boy!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Ricky!
Ricky!
He isn't home yet.
Oh!
And what is this, Ethel?
It's the third time today you've been up here asking for Ricky.
Well, Fred and I want to talk to him about his ad in Variety.
Ethel Ad in Variety?
Uh-huh.
See you later, Lucy.
We got to go.
Ethel, what is it?
Come on, Ethel.
Ethel, tell me.
Come on!
Ethel!
Wait a minute!
One of you let go or I'm going to have a split personality.
All right, Ethel, let's have it.
Well?
Well, as long as you've opened your big bazoo you might as well tell her the whole thing.
All right.
You see, it's this way.
We saw Ricky's ad in Variety.
Ricky's ad?
What's it for?
He's looking for new acts for his show down at the club.
I didn't see that.
Where's our Variety?
Here it is.
It's inside the back page, I think.
Oh.
How do you like that?
He cut it out.
He told me there was a recipe in here he wanted to save.
He's a slick one, all right.
He'd do anything to keep you from going in show business.
Yeah, well, what kind of acts does Tricky Ricky need?
Well, he needs a dance team.
That's where Fred and I come in.
Yeah, anywhere where I come in?
Well, he needs a good dog act.
Well, thanks a lot.
Fred Mertz!
And the ad said he needed a beautiful showgirl, too.
That's me!
Sure.
Hey, looks like there's a spot for all of us in his show.
Yeah.
And this time, we're not going to let him talk us out of it No.
Not for one minute.
Hi, everybody.
What's going on here?
We're answering your recipe in Variety.
Oh, so that's it, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
Give us a chance to show you our routine, will you, Rick?
Come on, you might you might like it if you give us a chance to show it to you.
Ricky!
Thanks for coming down, folks.
And don't call us, we'll call you.
Ricky, you open this door!
I'm sorry, but the casting office is closed for the day.
Ricky Ricardo, you open this door!
Who wants to come in- two dancers and a showgirl or the Mertzes and my wife?
Well, you better make up your mind.
Who is going to be?
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it!
What?
Now, wait a minute.
Now, Ricky, before you say no, take a good look at us.
Look at the Mertzes; they're wonderful dancers.
The least you could do is give them an audition.
Tah-dah!
All right, all right, they can come down and audition but you're not going to get any more consideration than anyone else.
Oh, fine, Ricky.
Good enough.
All right.
Now that that's all settled how about a little game of cards, eh?
Well, Ricky, what about me?
Oh, you can play, too.
No, no, I mean you're giving Fred and Ethel their chance.
Haven't you got a place for me in the show?
Why, sure, honey.
I got just the place for you.
Where?
Out front, in the audience.
Oh, you.
Ricky, I think you're being mean.
If you keep Lucy from doing what she wants to do she'll develop some sort of a complex.
Yeah.
She might become depressed.
Yeah.
She might even go off her trolley.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you, Dr. Mertz.
Now, what is it going to be- bridge or canasta?
Oh, Ricky, you make me so mad.
Now, we're going to have this out right now.
You're never going to let me be in your show, are you?
Never!
Never!
Never!
Now, honey, don't be so upset.
Who knows?
Maybe some day in the far, distant future you may get your chance.
Where?
In that big nightclub up yonder?
I can see it now- Ricky Ricardo and his Heavenly Revue starring Lucy and her magic harp.
Good morning, Lucy.
Hi.
Pour yourself a cup of coffee.
Thanks, I will.
Why don't you sit down?
Don't mind if I do.
Help yourself to a cookie.
No, thanks, I'm not hungry.
What are you reading?
Listen, do you remember last night when you told Ricky that if I didn't get into show business I might develop some sort of a complex?
Yeah.
Well, you were right.
Yeah?
I got this book at the library and it says anybody who is constantly frustrated may do all sorts of things.
So?
So, look.
Abnormal Psychology.
Yeah, I'm learning to act abnormal.
For this, you need a book?
I thought you were on my side.
I am, but I was just making all that stuff up as I went along last night.
I don't really know anything about it.
Oh, yes, you do.
Listen to this.
"A person who is kept "may manifest this frustration "in the following ways: "One, he may assume the characteristics of the person he is kept from becoming.
" Now, you know Ricky's kept me from becoming a famous actress.
Uh-huh.
"Two, he may develop amnesia.
" Uh-huh.
"Three, he may withdraw from reality and become childlike again.
" Gee, what a keen bunch of complexes.
Which one of them are you going to have?
Which one?
I'm going to have all three of them.
All three of them?
Certainly.
Well, this, I got to see.
Lucy!
I'm home!
Hello, darling.
Hello.
How'd things go at rehearsal, darling?
Fine.
How'd things go here at home?
Oh, frightful, darling.
The phone woke me at the crack of noon.
Noel called.
We chatted till 1:00, I bathed till turned down scripts until 3:00.
Then Noel darling sent me the most darling present.
Oh, yes, it was a darling Cadillac.
You should really see it, darling, it's darling.
What is this?
What's what, darling?
Why don't you cut it out and be yourself, huh?
I'd be happy to be myself if I could remember who I am.
Who am I?
Who are you?
Well, don't you know either, buster?
Buster?
What kind of a gag is this?
Now, Lucy, what are you trying to do?
Lucy is that my name?
Well, it was when I left here this morning.
Oh, do you live here, too?
I have for the past five years.
Oh, we better get married.
We are married.
Ha!
You say that, but how do I know that it's true?
Honey, what are you talking about?
You stay away from me, fresh.
Fresh?
I was told never to talk to strange men.
My mother told me whoever she is.
Honey, are you sure you're well?
No, I'm not.
Could it possibly be that you're suffering from magnesia?
Amnesia!
Oh, who am I?
What am I?
Where am I?
Oh, honey Look, honey.
Look around you.
Doesn't this place look familiar to you?
No.
Oh!
No.
Oh, honey, now, come on, try to think.
Honey, look Oh, oh, honey, come here.
Where?
Look.
Look there.
Look.
Do you remember this picture?
I gave it to you.
Oh, she's pretty.
Who is she?
Honey, I think you're really sick.
May-May-Maybe you better go and lie down, huh?
All right, I'll go lie down.
Yeah.
Tha-That's not the bedroom, dear.
Oh.
That's not, either.
Oh.
No, honey, over Honey, over here.
That's where the bedroom is.
Oh.
Right here, honey.
Oh.
Now, you take it easy, honey.
You have a very lovely apartment here, mister.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Hello.
Hello, is Dr. Stevenson in?
Oh.
Well, look, please-please tell him to call me as soon as he gets in.
Oh, this is Ricky Ricardo.
Yes.
It's about my wife.
She's acting peculiar.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Well, this time it's even worse.
What?
Oh, I see.
I should humor her until-until the doctor calls me.
All right, all right, I'll humor her.
Yes.
Bye.
Hi!
Hi!
You want to play with me, little boy?
Will you?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Yeah, sure, sure, I'll play with you.
Take a lick of my sucker.
Go on.
Take a big lick.
Go on.
That's enough.
You want to play games, little boy?
Sure, yeah, I'll play a game with you.
Okay, I'll be the leader.
You stay where you are.
You want to play "May I"?
Yeah, whatever you say.
All right.
Okay, you stay right there, now.
I won't, no.
Don't you go away.
Okay, you take two giant steps.
All right.
May I?
No!
I want you to take me for a ride.
All right.
On my tricycle.
Now, wait a minute On my tricycle!
On my tricycle!
All right.
All right, on the tricycle.
All right.
I'll take you.

On the tricycle, I'll take you for a ride.
Whee!
Whee!
Ring the bell!

Toot the horn!
All right!
No eyes!
No eyes!
Toot the horn!
Toot the horn!
All right!
All right!
You pushed me!
Hi, Rick.
Hello, Fred.
How's Lucy?
Does she still think she's a child?
Yeah.
She's in the bedroom with Ethel.
They're playing jacks.
Ricky, I got to tell you something.
Not now, Fred.
Not now; later, please.
Lucy is faking.
Look, Fred, we'll talk about it later.
The most important thing right now is her heal What do you mean, she's faking?
I was downstairs in the basement listening through the furnace pipe and I heard everything that Lucy and Ethel said.
Well, why didn't you tell me before?
It took me an hour to get my head out of the pipe.
Why, that little monkey.
She'll do anything to get in the act, won't she?
Looks like.
Oh, brother, I got a wonderful idea.
I'm going to teach her a lesson she will never forget.
Are you phoning the doctor?
No.
I'm phoning an actor friend of mine, Hal March.
Hello.
Hello, Hal?
Who's this, Ricky?
Yeah, this is Ricky.
Listen, Hal, I got a job for you- the part of a doctor.
Good.
What's the show?
Well, the show is called, uh "Getting Even with Lucy" and it all takes place right here in my apartment.
What?
Yes, here's the way it goes.
Lucy's been pretending that she's sick so that I'd feel sorry for her and give her a part in my new show.
So I want you to come over here and pretend that you're a doctor, see?
And while you're giving her a checkup you will discover that she has a very unusual condition.
Uh some rare tropical disease.
Like what?
I don't know.
Make it up.
Be tough to keep a straight face.
It's an awful dirty trick, Ricky.
Yeah, I know.
Like they say in Mexico "Mi amigo, alla va el zorrillo.
" What's that mean?
I'm a real stinker.
What comes after twosies?
Threesies.
Oh, yeah.
I'd forgotten how much fun this was.
Yes?
May I come in?
Oh, yes.
How do you feel, little girl?
Oh, she's not at all well.
She has a terrible fever.
I feel fine, mister.
I'm playing jacks.
Oh, Ethel, it's all my fault.
I wish she would snap out of it.
You know, I just decided to star her in the club.
Ricky, that's wonderful.
Wow, what do you know?
!
She got her memory back.
Oh, yes, I know who I am.
I'm Lucy, and you're Ricky.
Ethel!
Welcome home, honey.
Well, when do we start rehearsal?
Now, wait a minute, honey.
Wait a minute.
You know, you've been very sick.
So I asked a doctor to come over.
A doctor?
But I feel fine.
Oh, no, no, no, never mind that.
But I feel fine.
Doctor!
Come in, doctor.
This is my wife Lucy, doctor.
How do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?
I feel fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, would you remove this, please?
I- I won't need that.
Excuse me.
Well, now Oh oh I'm glad you called me in, Mr. Ricardo.
Pretty bad, huh?
Oh, yes.
Now, if you'll just open your mouth, Mrs. Ricardo and stick out your tongue.
Say, "Ah.
" Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
What is it, doctor?
I don't know yet.
Is it very bad, doctor?
We'll have to see.
Well, I feel fine.
Yeah, well, I'm Please, please, Mrs. Ricardo, don't talk.
You may need all your strength.
Just hold that right there.
Now, if you'll just turn around and give me a little cough, Mrs. Ricardo.
A little cough?
Louder.
Louder.
Now, Mrs. Ricardo if you'll just give me one good cough.
Hmm, just as I feared.
Oh Well, what is it?
You can tell me; I can take it.
Frankly, Mrs. Ricardo you've contracted a terrible, terrible attack of the go-bloots.
Go-bloots?
Doctor, what kind of a disease is that?
Well, we doctors don't know too much about it but there's a terrible epidemic of it lately.
It seems it seems it came into the country on the hind legs of the booshoo bird.
I got the go-bloots from a booshoo bird?
Ew Tell me, doctor, is it very, very serious?
Well, Mr. Ricardo I may as well be honest with you.
If it gets worse, we may have to operate.
Operate?
Yes, we'll have to go in and take out your zorch.
My zorch?
!
There's nothing wrong with my zorch.
Now, now, don't be alarmed, Mrs. Ricardo.
Some people go on for years without a zorch.
Well, is the operation painful?
No, no, we anesthetize thoroughly for a zorchectomy.
Well, tell me, doctor, uh would you be forced to remove the entire zorch?
Well, Mr. Ricardo, we may be very fortunate and save half and as I always say half a zorch is better than none.
Of course, even if I'm able to save half you'll never be able to trummel again.
I won't?
Oh What's trummeling?
Well, it's an involuntary internal process.
Oh.
Doctor, is there anything we can do for her?
All we can do is just wait.
She should reach the crisis very soon.
Just wait and hope that she doesn't turn green.
Green!
Yes, yes, green.
That's the danger sign.
Well, what happens then?
If you turn green, a half hour later  gone.
Gone?
Gone.
Deal me out, boys.
How's the patient?
Did the patient got rid of the go-bloots?
I'm afraid not, Fred.
She just turned green.
Now, don't be silly.
There's no such thing as go-bloots.
Thanks.
I know, I know but there's such a thing as a green light bulb.
You didn't Yes, I did.
Oh, you rascal, you.
I sneaked in there when she was asleep and I put a green light bulb in the lamp by her bed.
Well, how did you keep Ethel from finding out?
I sent Florence Nightingale to the drugstore for some aspirin.
Oh, good.
Now, listen, when she comes back you better get her to bed.
Why?
Well, she told me that she's starting to feel some pains in her zorch, too.
Oh, no, no.
Ricky!
Ricky!
Ricky!
Come on, the fun is about to begin.
Ricky!
I'm coming!
I'm coming!
Ricky What's the matter, honey?
My hands, they're green.
Why, they are.
Your face is green, too.
Oh, no!
Give me the mirror, give me the mirror.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my face!
And my hair!
Oh Ricky Oh!
Oh!
You got the go-bloots, too.
What are you talking about?
You're both green.
We are?
No, Fred.
She doesn't know what she's saying.
Fred, do I look green to you?
No.
You don't look green to me, either.
Oh, no.
I'm looking at the world through green-colored eyeballs.
Lucy, here's your pill.
Take one of these, and you'll  You're green.
I've been sick.
Oh you poor little green thing.
Oh, this is it, Ricky.
This is it, I'm going.
Good-bye, Ethel.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Fred.
So long, chum.
Good-bye, Ricky.
Now, wait a minute, honey.
Don't go yet.
Why not?
Well, I asked some of the boys in the band to come over here and play a farewell dirge for you.
What'd he say?
Some of the boys in the band came over to play a farewell dirge.
Oh.
Well, I'll try to hang on.
I wouldn't want them to have made the trip for nothing.
Good girl, good girl.
All right, fellas!
Fellas!
Come in.
All right, fellows.
Now, please, this is the last music that she will ever hear.
So make it sweet.
What kind of music was that?
Yeah, watch it, will you, fellas?
I'm dying.
Lucy, I have something to tell you, honey.
What?
There's no such thing as the go-bloots.
How can you look me in my green eye and say that?
Well, honey, you're not green either.
Show her, Fred.
All right.
A green light bulb?
: Yeah.
Then you mean I'm not really sick at all?
No, honey, you're perfectly well.
You were just pretending all the time, you big bum.
Now, wait a minute.
Remember, you pretended first, you know.
This makes us igual Pascual.
What does that mean?
That's "even Steven" in Spanish.
Come here.
I guess you're right, honey.
Mmm   Well, when do we start rehearsing?
Rehearsing?
You said I could be the star of the show.
Now, wait a minute, honey.
I only said Ricky, you promised me.
You said I could be the star of the show.
I didn't force you to say it, you know.
Now, Ricky, you made me a promise and What's the matter?
Ricky?
Ricky, what's the matter?
Ricky!
Who am I?
What am I?
Where am I?
Oh, I give up, I give up.
You win.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Hi, honey.
Hey, did you see this evening's paper?
Listen to this.
Uh, "The indisputed star "of a great evening entertainment "the genius of the conga drum "who, as usual, stopped the show last night "with his rendition of 'Babaloo' Ricky Ricardo.
" Couldn't have been better if I wrote it myself.
How about that?
Lucy what are you doing?
I'm writing a play.
You're writing a what?
A play.
And there it is finished.
dripping with intrigue, dripping with excitement!
I better get the mop.
Never mind.
I wonder if Ethel's ready with her costume.
Good.
Oh, I wonder what she looks like.
Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Shakespeare but, um would you mind telling me what this is all about?
Well, you see, all the women's clubs in town are having a big playwriting contest.
I knew it, I knew it.
This had to do with the Wednesday Afternoon Fang and Claw Society.
It's the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League.
Gee, just think, if our play wins I might become a big, famous playwright.
I might become another Tennessee Ernie.
That's Tennessee Williams.
Oh.
You know, that's a very interesting name- Tennessee.
I wonder what I should call myself?
How about "South Dakota Ricardo"?
No, it's not so good, is it?
Why don't you tell them you were born in Providence?
Then they can call you "Rhode Island Red.
" Stop.
Incidentally, how do you happen to be the one who's writing this play?
How do you think?
You're the only one that has a typewriter?
No, smarty.
I happen to be very close to the star who's going to play the lead.
Oh?
Anyone I know?
Well, I-I can't reveal his name.
I'm saving it for publicity.
Uh-huh.
Uh, this, uh this, uh, star that is going to play the lead his initials aren't "Ricky Ricardo," are they?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Hah!
You flatter yourself.
Da, da, da  Da, da, da, Da-da, da, da, da.
Could I help you, madam?
That's Ethel.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
How do you like my costume?
It's just wonderful, Ethel.
Who are you supposed to be?
Well, what do you think?
The Bride of Frankenstein?
Well!
She's a Spanish senora.
She suffers in the translation.
Oh Are you ready for rehearsal?
Rehearsal?
You mean you finished the whole play since dinner?
Uh-huh.
It's only been two hours.
Well, that's nothing for a famous playwright like "Rhode Island Red.
" Huh?
Oh, he means me.
Pay no attention to him.
What did it turn out to be a comedy, a drama or an epic?
She wasn't sure when she started.
Oh.
A drama.
Light or heavy?
Well, about medium, I think.
Well, that does it.
Let me know when rehearsal is over.
I thought maybe that you'd help us out by reading the man's part.
Well, honey, if I'm not going to be in it what good would that do?
Well, uh Oh, please, Ricky, won't you do it for me and "Rhode Island Red"?
Well, all right.
If you put it that way, I will.
Good.
What is it all about?
Well, it's a tender, moving, heart-rending story of a Cuban tobacco picker and his love for the plantation owner's daughter.
Wait a minute.
This play is all about a Cuban tobacco picker?
Yes, but don't worry- you're not going to be in it.
Now, you go out in the kitchen and wait for your entrance cue.
Now, go on.
Go on.
All right.
Now, remember, Ethel I am a gorgeous, dark-eyed beauty and you're my fat, ugly, old crone of a mother.
Fat?
Yes.
Well, it'll take a lot of acting but I guess I can do it.
All right.
Now, as the scene opens you're sitting outside your hacienda and you're rocking back and forth on your veranda.
Now, you're seated there.
You're rocking back and forth and you're singing, and I come out of my hacienda.
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la  How long do I keep singing?
Till I make my entrance.
La, la, la, la-la, la, la La-la, la, la, la-la, la, la, la ?
Como esta, Mamasita?
"My bean, Lukita.
" "My bean, Lukita.
" That's "Muy bien, Lucita.
" Oh.
Yeah.
"Muy bien, Lucita.
" Mamasita, how you like me in my new dress?
"You look very pretty, Lucita.
"Your hair is shining, your eyes are bright and your nose is continued on the next page.
" You don't read that- that's the directions.
Well, how can I tell?
It's all run together.
Well, I typed it in a big hurry, Now, go on and read it with an accent.
This is in Spanish.
Oh.
"Why are you all dressed up, Lucita"?
Because I think I go for a walk through the mango trees.
"That's nice"?
: "That's nice?
That's nice"?
What's the matter?
That's not a question!
Well, there's a question mark here.
There is not.
Look.
Oh.
Well, there shouldn't be.
You ought to know that.
How should I ought to know that?
Well, go on, go on.
"That's nice.
Do you go alone"?
Si, I go alone.
"Eh, eh, eh!
I think you go there to meet your liver.
" Lover!
"I think you go there to meet your lover "that worthless, good-for-nothing tobacco picker.
"How can you even look at him- you, the plantation owner's daughter"?
Shush, Mamasita, here he comes now.
: Shush, Mamasita, here he comes now.
Ricky, that's your cue!
Oh.
: Senora y senorita.
Buenas noches.
?
Como estan?
What are you doing with a sandwich?
I didn't write that into the script.
Well, I got so hungry waiting for my cue, I ad-libbed it.
Well, swallow and come on.
All right.
Uh "Buenas noches, senora y senorita.
?
Como estan"?
?
Como esta, mi amor?
"?
Como esta, you big bum"?
Oh, you pay no attention to Mama, Fernando.
She no feel well.
Now you kneel.
I kneel.
All right.
Uh "I am sorry to hear you don't feel well, Mamasita.
Are you having trouble with your lover"?
Liver!
"Are you having trouble with your liver"?
"No, I am not, Fernando.
"I am feeling not well "because you are in love with my daughter "but you have no way to make money to support her, do you"?
"No, I dun't.
" No, Mama, he "dun't.
" Now, wait a minute, Wait a minute.
Wh-What's the idea of making fun of me in this play?
Fun of you?
Yeah, look at the way you got "don't" spelled: D-U-N-T.
Well, that's a typographical error.
Yeah?
Yeah, now go on.
All right.
"Someday I will be "a big man, senora.
I am learning how to play the conga drum.
" Oh, yes, Mama, he make nice music on the drum.
Lots of noise, Mama, yes.
Mm-hmm.
"Someday I will become famous "by singing a song called 'Babaloo'"?
Uh, it's a very nice song, Mama.
iBabaloo!
iBabaloo!
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Who is this Cuban tobacco picker who plays the conga drums and sings "Babaloo"?
Guess.
Sir Cedric Hardwicke?
No.
John Charles Thomas?
No.
Lassie?
All right, Ricky.
I wrote the whole thing with you in mind.
No!
Well, I thought when you read it and you found out what a good part it was you'd want to be in it.
Well, Lucy, I realize that this part will make Laurence Olivier hop on the next boat but, uh thanks just the same.
But Ricky, you've got to do it.
Why?
Well, because Because that's the only reason they let Lucy write the play.
Lucy!
You mean, you were just using me to further your own selfish purposes?
For shame!
But Ricky I am sorry, I am not interested.
Get yourself a new boy.
Good-bye.
Ricky Ricardo, you'll regret this!
Well, I'm pretty sure that I will but, uh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Playwright.
Thanks for thinking of me.
I will always treasure this original carbon copy of your masterpiece forever.
Oh Oh, Lucy, I'm sorry I had to open my big, fat mouth.
Well, don't you worry, Ethel.
There's a lot of actors in this town that'll jump at the chance and I'm going to call them right now.
Uh-huh?
Yes.
Well, yes, yes, it's an original play for a woman's club.
Oh, yes, you'll be the star.
How's that?
Oh, no, we can't pay you anything.
Well, you see, our club Hello?
Hello?
Hello Oh.
Good morning, Lucy.
How you doing?
Oh, awful.
Actors are certainly peculiar.
They won't work unless you pay them.
Well, look, Lucy Hmm?
as long as you haven't found anyone to play the part I know someone who'll do it.
Really?
Is he the right type?
Oh, sure.
He's a real Latin lover.
I'll bring him in.
Oh!
Introducing Fernando.
Tah-dah!
Ya, dya-da, dya, dya, dya-da, dya-da, da.
Oh, Ethel, why do you always foist Fred on me?
Foist?
Yes, foist.
You're some Latin lover.
Well, I took Latin in high school.
Amo, amas, amat, amamus, amatis, amant.
What's the matter with that?
But this is Spanish.
Do you know how to speak Spanish?
Bonus nokas, sinura.
There, he sounds just like Ricky.
Yeah, he sounds like Ricky speaking English.
Well, maybe he doesn't look the part and maybe he can't speak Spanish but you'll have to admit there's one thing in his favor.
What?
He's willing to do it.
Oh, what a spot to be in.
You know who's going to judge these plays?
A big movie producer, Darryl B. Mayer.
What a chance to be seen.
Yeah, and I'm stuck with Fat Freddy, the Latin lover.
Oh, now, wait a minute, Lucy.
Give us a break.
Why, I'll go on a diet.
Well, that isn't the only thing, Fred.
The important thing is the way you sound.
Can you speak any other language?
Say, he can do British.
He can?
: Well, rather, old thing.
I'll put you through to my secretary.
Cheerio!
Pip-pip!
And all that silly sort of rot.
Hey, that isn't bad.
How about you, Ethel?
Oh, definitely, darling.
Right-o, old bean.
Good show, Deborah.
Thank you.
Ha-ha!
That's wonderful.
How about you, Lucy?
Uh, let's see now.
Uh afternoon, Mater.
Pater won't be down for tea.
We just buried him.
Had to- dead, you know.
Oh, this is great!
I'll switch the whole thing to England.
Right-o?
Right-o!
Right-o!
Pip-pip, cheerio, here we go.
Well, there you are.
Good morning, ladies.
Would you pour me a spot of tea, my dear louse?
Louse?
Oh "My dear Louise.
" Hiya, Fred.
Hi.
I just came down to see if you want to go to the fights.
You know, Lucy is going to be in that stupid play.
I can't make it, Rick.
Why not?
Well, I'm going to be in the stupid play, too.
You are going to?
You mean to tell me you let them make a boob out of you?
All right, go ahead and laugh.
Just wait till Darryl B. Mayer gets a gander at my performance.
Darryl B. Mayer?
Yeah.
What does he want with a corny contest like that?
He's just going to judge the whole thing, that's all.
Hollywood, here I come.
Darryl B. Mayer!
Where you get an idea like that?
It's in the morning paper.
Here.
It is?
Take a look at it yourself.
Uh Fred old chum old pal old buddy Yeah?
We've been friends for a long time.
Yeah.
Well, I'm not going to let them do this to you.
You're not?
No, sir.
Old chum old pal Old buddy.
I'm not going to let them make a boob out of you.
You're not?
No, sir.
I'm going to let them make a boob out of me.
And incidentally, let Mayer make a star out of you.
Fred, you hurt me when you say things like that.
You don't realize what a tremendous sacrifice I'm making.
and Lucy's would be worse than any of them.
Now, if Mayer sees you in a flop you're finished.
You know, I hadn't thought of that.
I guess you're right.
Of course I'm right.
When is the play, tonight?
Yeah.
Well, I better go upstairs and rehearse my part, eh?
Well, here, take this.
No, no, I-I have my own script but listen, don't say anything to Lucy, eh?
I want to surprise her, see?
I don't, uh I don't want her to think that I'm trying to get into her play.
Oh, then you are trying to get into it.
Now, wait a minute.
All right, Rick old pal old chum old buddy I'm not going to let you do it.
Why not?
Because the play is going to be a flop- you said so yourself- and you can't afford to be in a flop.
Well, Fred, you seem to forget one little thing that makes it different.
Oh, what's that?
With me in it, how can it possibly be a flop?
Yeah, I did forget that.
Adios.
You have just seen Mrs. Glazingham's play entitled Pearl One, Drop Two or Much Ado about Knitting.
Isn't that a dear title?
Knitting I-I think Oh, well, anyway, um  That brings us to the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts entry in our contest.
It was written by Mrs. Ricky Ricardo and is entitled The Perils of Pamela.
Take it away, Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League.
A pip-pip and toodle-oo.
I wonder what could be keeping my daughter Pamela.
She should have been here a fortnight ago.
Ah, there's dear old Pam now.
Oh oh, I must have been jolly well mistaken.
There's obviously no one there.
Ah, here she comes now.
She's coming up the walk.
She must have had terrible trouble tethering her 'orse.
Psst!
Oh, daughter!
How you startled me!
Afternoon, Mater.
Afternoon, daughter.
Well, I don't mind telling you, Mater, I've 'ad it.
Why, whatever do you mean, Pamela?
All morning long I was riding the hounds and frankly, I'm pooped.
Tired from riding the 'ounds?
Yes, and I do believe Pamela, what you need is a spot of tea.
Right-o, Mater.
That's it, a spot of tea.
Thank you very much.
There you are.
Thank you.
May I have some sugar?
Thank you.
May I have some milk?
Thank you.
May I have a needle and thread?
Whatever for?
I have a nasty tear in my tea bag.
Pamela I've been wanting to talk to you.
What's the mater, Matter?
Uh, what's the matter, Mater?
It's about this Reggie you've been going with.
Oh!
Not another word, Mater.
I love the lad.
That's all that matters, Mater.
Well, we'll take this up with Pater later.
Mater!
Now, Pamela.
Oh, here comes Reggie now.
Buenas noches senora y senorita.
?
Como estan?
Ricky!
Uh, uh Reggie!
What happened?
Uh Oh, I know, Mater.
You do?
Yes, Reggie's all dressed up for the king's birthday ball.
: Oh, good show!
Yes, good show.
MAN IN  I think it stinks.
Uh uh, Reggie, what you need is a spot of tea and a crumpet.
Si, Mamasita.
Si, Mamasita.
I'm sorry you're not feeling well.
Are you having trouble with your liver?
Um What now?
There will be a short intermission.
I don't know.
What's happen?
Ricky, what's the matter with you?
I never was so humiliated in my life.
What are you trying to do, ruin my whole play?
Yeah, what are you trying to do?
No, no, honest, I was trying to be good.
I just wanted to surprise you.
What happened?
"What happened"?
You're doing the wrong script.
We switched to British.
This is the one we're doing.
Oh, well, what are we going to do?
Well, we'll just have to change so that we're all doing the same thing.
Oh, all right, all right.
Oh, Lucy What's happened?
What shall I tell the audience?
Well, tell them that we're going to change costumes and we're going back to the original version, A Tree Grows in Havana.
Oh, I hope I don't get my "cheerios" mixed up with my "como estas.
" You won't.
Come on.
Oh, what shall we do?
Well, entertain them, Miss Mitchell.
Entertain them.
Me?
!
Sure, go ahead.
Oh, all right.
I just happened to bring a poem.
"By the shores of Gitche Gumee "By the shining big-sea-water "Stood the wigwam of Nokomis "Daughter of the moon, Nokomis.
"Dark behind it rose the forest "Rose the black and gloomy pine trees "Rose the firs with cones upon them Rose the " We will continue with A Tree Grows in Havana.
La, la, la, la-la, la, la La-la, la, la ?
Como esta, Mamasita?
Muy bien, Lucita.
How you like my dress, Mamasita?
It is very pretty but why are you all dressed up for?
Because I go for a walk through the mango trees.
Do you go alone?
Si, I go alone.
Eh, eh, eh!
I think you go there to meet your lover, Fernando that good-for-nothing, worthless tobacco picker.
Shush, Mamasita, here he comes now.
Chip-chip, heerio, and all that sort of thing.
Anyone for tennis?
Oh, no.
Oh!
What happened?
Oh
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
I want a girl Just like the girl That married dear, old Dad : My dear old dad.
Oh, that was wonderful!
We're great.
Yeah, you even sounded good.
Thank you.
You know, a little more practice and we could do singing commercials for television.
Gee, Ethel, you certainly play the piano wonderfully.
Oh, thanks, Lucy.
Hey, how about "Sweet Sue"?
Yeah, that has a nice harmony, all right?
Da-da da-da-da-da Oh, wait a minute, Ethel.
It's, uh, it's 2:00 in the morning.
Well, what about it, honey?
Yeah, yeah, 2:00's the perfect time for "Sweet Sue.
" Yeah.
Well, I mean, it's a little late.
Won't the other tenants complain?
About what, honey?
About what?
About all the noise.
Noise?
Noise?
Noise?
Huh, we're not making noise; we're making music.
Yeah.
Let them phone the landlord.
I'm not home.
I always forget that you're the landlord.
Yeah, come on.
Besides, what's wrong with good friends harmonizing a little?
That's what the world needs more of.
You're right.
Oh, it's so wonderful to have landlords like you two.
What a break for us to have tenants like you two.
Well, okay, okay, "Sweet Sue.
" Yeah.
Da-da da-da-da-da Look at this place, Lucy.
You've taken such good care of it we could rent it tomorrow and not have to change a thing.
Yeah.
Okay, okay, "Sweet Sue.
" Da-da da-da-da-da Well, you know why, Ethel?
It was in such wonderful condition when we moved in.
Well, all right, all right, girls.
Now, "Sweet Sue.
" Da-da da-da da-da You're the nicest tenant I ever had.
And you're certainly the nicest landlady I've ever had.
And this is the most sickening conversation I've ever heard.
You're so right.
Oh Oh, you two have no sentiment.
I move that we dedicate the next number to our wonderful friendship.
All right, to our friendship.
I subscribe to that.
That's a wonderful idea.
To Ricky and Lucy.
Here we go.
Ah, now then.
All right?
"Sweet Sue"- ready, go.
"Sweet Sue.
" Good, wasn't it?
Da-da da-da-da-da Every star above Knows the one I love Sweet Sue, just you And the moon up high Knows the reason why Sweet Sue, yes, you No one else, it seems, ever shared my dreams And without you, dear, I don't know what I'd do In this heart of mine you live all the time Sweet Sue, that's you : Nobody but you.
Oh, that's all.
It's getting late.
We got to go.
Yeah, we got to get out of here.
You got to go?
Oh, no, Ethel.
Thanks for everything, now.
Oh, honey, no.
Oh, that's too bad.
Thanks for everything, Rick.
Well, I'm glad you came up, Fred.
We've enjoyed it.
See you in the morning.
Good-bye, Ethel.
You cut that out.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh Gee  Aren't they wonderful people?
Yeah, they sure are a lot of fun, honey.
Oh, I had such a good time tonight.
I want to live in this apartment the rest of my life.
Well, honey, I think that you and I and Fred and Ethel are fated to go through life together.
Yep.
Hey, look.
Ethel left her rings here.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
You know, honey, she's absolutely right.
People ought to do more singing in this world.
That's right, honey.
Yes, sir, they sure should sing- everybody.
"Sweet Sue.
"  Every star above knows the one I love  Sweet Sue, just you And the moon up high knows the reason why Sweet Sue, yes, you No one else, it seems, ever shared my dreams And without you, dear, I don't know what I'd do.
Ya-da-bum, ba-de-dum, ba-de-dum, bum-bum.
What was that?
I don't know.
Come on, let's go.
In this heart of mine, you I  That sounded like it came from the Mertz apartment.
Oh, no, honey, it couldn't be.
No, I guess not.
You live all the  Time.
Sweet Sue, it's you.
Hello?
Hello, Lucy?
Hi, Ethel, what's you what's on your mind?
What's going on up there, anyway?
Oh, we're singing "Sweet Sue.
" Want to come up for another chorus?
Do you know what time it is?
How do you expect anybody to get to sleep?
Why, Ethel, what's the matter?
You thought it was fine when you were up here.
Well, I'm down here now and I think it's lousy.
Well, really, Ethel!
How can you change in such a short time?
Good night, Lucy.
Good night.
What's the matter with Ethel?
She must've walked downstairs too fast and gotten the bends.
What?
Well, she's a little grumpy because we're making noise.
Well, I thought she Well, so did I. She'll be over it in the morning.
All right.
Come on, honey, let's go to bed.
Da-da da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da    Oh, no, you don't.
Now, Ricky All right, all right, we'll compromise.
That's a compromise?
Now, what do you want me to do, freeze to death?
A little fresh air isn't going to hurt you you hothouse plant.
Hello?
Will you cut out that racket up there?
Fred?
Yes, Fred!
How do you expect people to get any sleep?
Well, I was only closing the windows.
What with?
A sledgehammer?
Now listen, Fred Listen, my foot.
Now, let's have it quiet up there!
Huh, how do you like that?
"Let's have it quiet up there"!
he says.
Some lousy landlords they are.
Yeah.
Nerts to the Mertz.
Yeah.
Well good night, baby.
Good night, honey.
Oh, no.
The shower is dripping.
Yep, sure is.
Somebody should get up and fix it.
Yep, somebody should.
Well?
This isn't getting us anyplace.
We'll both get up and fix it.
What?
That's the only fair way.
When I count to three, we'll both jump out of bed.
All right.
You ready?
Ready.
Okay.
One two three!
Apparently, we can't trust either of us.
Apparently.
Well, as far as I'm concerned, that shower can drip all night.
I just don't care.
I won't pay any attention to it.
All right, neither will I. All right.
All right.
I can't stand it anymore!
I can't stand it, I tell you!
I can't stand it!
I can't stand it anymore!
I can't stand it!
What are you doing?
I can't lock it up!
I can't lock it!
I'm going to use the wrench.
Oh  Hello?
What's going on up there now?
!
Ricky's trying to fix some of your antique plumbing!
That's what's going on!
Oh, no.
Let me talk to him!
All right!
Fred wants to talk to you!
Just a minute!
Oh, Ricky!
Ricky, what happened?
!
What happened?
!
What happened?
!
Oh Oh The pipe broke, that's what happened!
Oh, honey, you're all wet.
Give me that phone!
Hello!
Listen, lunkhead, stop pounding on those pipes!
Listen, you old poop why don't you put some decent plumbing in this firetrap?
!
We will, as soon as we get some decent tenants!
Yeah?
Well, maybe you'd like us to move.
That'd suit me fine.
All right, all right!
That settles it- we're moving!
Good-bye and good riddance!
Good-bye!
We're moving!
Good!
They're moving.
Good!
I wouldn't stay in this crummy apartment with those horrible Mertzes if you paid me.
Hello!
Hello.
I'd like to speak to Mrs. Mertz.
Hello.
Whoever told you you could play the piano?
!
Good morning.
I hate to bother you, Mrs. Ricardo but I believe I left my diamond rings on your piano last night.
Yes, you did, Mrs. Mertz.
I'd be very happy to get them for you.
Oh, don't bother.
I'll get them if they're still there.
I don't know why you should worry.
You can always buy another box of Cracker Jack.
I'll have you know these are real diamonds.
Ha!
Mrs. Ricardo, would you be so kind as to inform me just when we are to be deprived of your charming company?
Very shortly.
Good.
Thank you.
My, it'll certainly be nice getting away from such disagreeable people.
It certainly will.
Would you like to give me the check for the next five months' rent now?
Of course, I'd be delighted.
What do you mean "the next five months' rent"?
Well, if you're leaving you have to pay off your lease.
Our lease?
!
Yes, don't you remember?
You begged me on bended knee to give you a lease just so that no one else could have this fantastically inexpensive, lovely apartment.
Oh, you mean that one-sided, unfair, binding contract that we were forced to sign before you would grant us the privilege of moving into this broken-down hovel?
"Broken-down" is right.
Look at this place.
It'll take the next five months' rent to redecorate.
Redecorate?
Yes.
After we fumigate.
You can leave the check in my mailbox.
I Ooh!
Honey, I don't seem to be able to Oh, shut up!
What's the matter with you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Ethel was just up here and she made me so darn mad!
What now?
She says she they're going to hold us to our lease.
We have to give them five months' rent before we can leave!
I guess we're stuck here.
Well, now that, uh that all depends.
On what?
On whether we can, uh, break the lease or not.
Do you think we can?
Mm could be.
What's on your mind?
We are going to become the two most unpleasant, disagreeable nasty people in the whole world.
But how?
We'll force ourselves.
Oh, boy.
Let's see, now.
What can we think of that'll make them kick us out?
Nah Think nastier.
We'll get it.
Hiya, honey.
Hi!
How's my little lease-breaker doing?
Just fine.
Ha, ha!
That's good.
How'd things go at rehearsal?
Oh, pretty good, honey.
Look.
What's that?
A riveter's hammer.
Watch.
Hey, that's very good.
That's very good.
I'm surprised they haven't moved out.
Yeah?
I have quite a schedule.
Oh, it's time to make another call to Ethel.
Let me, let me, let me do this.
Hey!
What happened?
Shh- get this.
Yeah?
Hello, this is the Ajax Salvage Company.
We buy old glass.
I understand you have some rings that you're interested in selling.
Oh, she's furious!
Oh, am I glad I'm on your side!
We'll break that lease yet.
Now, remember, when you come home tonight make a lot of noise.
Oh, that reminds me.
I won't be home till late tonight, honey.
Why?
Well, we have to rehearse for a couple of hours after the club closes.
Ricky, why don't you have the rehearsal here?
Honey, are you crazy?
I got a 16-piece band.
I'll blow the roof off the joint.
Well doesn't look like rain.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Good.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
A cumba, cumba, cumba cumbachero iChero!
A bongo, bongo, bongo, bongosero iBongosero!
Bongosero que se va.
iBongosero que se va!
Oh, that was wonderful!
That's the best number you've done since midnight.
What time is it?
Uh, 4:30.
All right, now let's have a loud one.
A loud one?
Yeah.
All right.
Listen, I wonder how Fred and Ethel are enjoying it.
Well, they have a lot of courage.
I haven't heard a peep out of them.
Oh, boy, this is swell.
No, isn't it?
Honey, who are all these people?
I don't know, but the more, the noisier.
Yeah?
All right, we'll dedicate the next number to Fred and Ethel Mertz.
Great!
All right.
Fred and Ethel Mertz?
Yes, our lovely landlords.
They won't hear this.
They're still down in the street.
Down in the street?
Yes, they have a big sign that says, "Jam Session Tonight: Ricky Ricardo in Person" and they're selling tickets.
Oh, no!
Oh!
How do you like that?
I'm going down there and give them a piece of my mind.
Yeah!
Oh, they're back in their apartment.
It was too cold outside.
Oh They sold us the last tickets.
Oh, they're back in their apartment, are they?
Well, we'll dedicate the next number to Fred and Ethel Mertz- an old Cuban folk dance called "El Break-o the Lease-o.
" "El Break-o the Lease-o"?
Yes.
How does this old Cuban folk dance go?
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-dum Oh, that one!
That one!
Everybody!
Okay Okay, you win.
Here's your lease.
Ba da ba-da-dah  Is that all, honey?
I think so.
Gee, it'll certainly be good to get out of this joint, won't it?
Yeah.
Did you tell Ethel we were moving today?
Well, I haven't seen her since she brought up the lease.
I mailed her a note telling her to come up and get the keys today.
What shall I do about this?
What is it?
It's a picture of us and Fred and Ethel taken in Atlantic City last summer.
Oh.
We sure had a lot of fun there, didn't we?
Yeah.
What shall I do, throw it away?
Oh, no, no, I better pack it.
Huh?
Well, we can always cut them out with a scissors.
What are all these things here?
Oh, they're some things I borrowed from Ethel.
She has a lot of my things, too if she hasn't sold them.
You know, I got a lot of tools that belong to Fred.
Some of them we bought together.
What shall I do with those?
I don't know.
Gee, it's amazing we could have been such good friends with a couple of stinkers.
Yeah we sure had a lot of fun in the last nine years until they showed their true colors.
Yeah.
Well, that just shows you how sneaky they are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here, honey, you want some paper for that?
Come in, come in, please.
All these are yours.
Oh, thanks.
Uh These are yours, I guess.
Thanks.
It's all right.
Here's some things of yours that somehow got into my apartment.
Thanks.
There are some of your things that I managed to get hold of.
It's all there.
You can count it if you like.
Oh, well, that won't be necessary, Mrs. Mertz.
: I trust you.
You do?
Uh Uh look, uh, Fred, uh it doesn't matter to me, you know but, uh, for some crazy reason or other I think Lucy wants to stay.
Don't you, Lucy?
Well, it doesn't matter to me either but it's, uh, up to Ethel.
What do you say, honey?
I  You heard what the girls said.
I guess we're staying, eh?
Yeah.
Only-Only this time, I want a long lease so that we don't ever get kicked out.
Well Fred I just happen to have a new lease already made out.
Oh, how wonderful!
Let's Help me unpack!
Unpack?
!
Yeah!
Yeah!
You're staying!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Hi.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi, Lucy.
You ready?
Hi, Rick.
Yeah, almost.
Come on, Ricky, get your coat, honey.
Picture starts at 8:22.
Oh, honey, I-I think you better go alone.
I'm having nothing but problems with my new show.
Oh, Ricky, what kind of problems?
Well it's a cavalcade of show business we're doing and I'm-I'm having trouble finding some acts.
Oh, what kind of acts do you need, Ricky?
What kind of acts do you need?
Now, look, Lucy we're not going to go all over this again.
You cannot be in the show.
Give me one good reason.
You have no talent.
Give me another good reason.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Look, honey, even if I wanted to put you in the show I wouldn't be able to do it.
There's only two openings- a ballet dancer and a pair of burlesque comics.
I'm a ballet dancer.
Well, I am, and I've had I've had experience, too.
I- I-I was in a dance recital in high school- "The Dance of the Flowers.
" She has got nice stems.
Thank you.
I was the only petunia that did a solo.
Look, Petunia, Madame Lamand- the premier ballerina of the French Ballet- is staging this number.
I hardly think that she would consider that training enough.
Well, then she'll just have to be shown.
I just happen to have that costume in my trunk and I know that I can do that dance just as well now as I did then.
Once you really know ballet, it never leaves you.
Lucy, I didn't know you were a ballet dancer.
For four years, I was never off my toes.
What am I going to do about her?
Have you ever thought of putting her in a large basket and leaving her on somebody's doorstep?
: No, that wouldn't work.
She's too smart; she'd find her way home.
Hey, Rick  You know those comedians you want- do they do they really have to be, uh, burlesque comics?
You know, I did a very funny act years ago with my partner, Ted Kertz.
Mertz and Kertz, the laugh twins.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Presenting Mertz and Kertz.
Well, if I ain't my ol if it ain't my old friend, Fred.
How are you, Fred?
Well, if it ain't my old friend, Ted.
How are you, Ted?
Did you hear about the terrible accident on the streetcar, Freddy?
No, I didn't hear about an accident on the streetcar, Teddy.
You mean to tell me you didn't hear about the accident on the streetcar, Teddy?
Mertz I'm Kertz.
Now I'm Mertz.
How are you, Rick?
They have to be burlesque comics.
Aw, pshaw, that's too bad.
Hey, by the way what was the terrible accident on the streetcar?
Wouldn't you like to know?
No.
Well, I'll tell you anyway but remember, this is my best gag and you got to promise not to use it.
Okay, I promise.
What was the terrible accident on the streetcar, Fred?
Well, a man had his eye on a seat and a woman sat on it.
What a pip-a-roo!
Remember now, you promised not to use it.
That's one promise I will never break.
Introducing Petunia Ricardo.
Well?
Well, you'll do for the comic but who am I going to get for the ballet dancer?
Oh, Ricky, you're mean.
Look, honey, you're not serious about this, are you?
I am, too.
Here I am with all this talent bottled up inside of me and you're always sitting on the cork.
Now, Lucy.
I'm gonna get in that show if it's the last thing I do.
Lucy, you're too young to die.
Whose side are you on?
Well I'm going to get in that show or my name isn't Lucy Ricardo.
What did you say, Clem?
Oh!
: Touche.
En garde!
I have just had a most exciting visit with the wife of Monsieur Ricardo.
She is a very experienced dancer and she will be your partner.
She is here now.
Come in, Madame Ricardo.
Entrez, entrez, entrez.
Come in, come in.
Mesdames et messieurs, Madame Ricardo.
Kiss the hand, Enchante, N'est-ce pas?
Now, first I think we will start with a few limbering-up exercises.
I assume you know all the basic positions.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
All right, Ici, madame, ici.
Classe, en place.
All righty, class.
Now then, first position.
Bon, bon.
No, madame, further out.
No, madame, the toes further out.
Madame, not that far out.
Now then, a plie.
And a one, a two, a three, a four a five, a six, a seven, eight.
A one, a two, a three, a four, a five Stop, stop, stop.
Stop!
Fifth position.
Now then Plie.
And a one, a two, a three, a four a five, a six, a seven, eight.
A one Tres bien, classe.
Petite battement.
And a one, a two, a three, a change.
A one, a two, a three, a change.
One, a two, a three, a change.

Releve.
Tour en I'air.
A one, a two, a three, a four a five, a six, a seven, eight.
A one, a two, a three, a four a five, a six, a seven, eight.
A one, a two, a three, a four Enough!
Enough!
Take a rest period!
Except Madame Ricardo.
Madame Ricardo, I am afraid you have not quite had the experience I had hoped for.
Well, I guess I am a little rusty.
I think we should go to the barre.
Oh, good, because I'm awful thirsty.
Madame This barre.
Oh, I thought you meant Take your place at the barre.
Feet in first position.
Now, in the first place your posture is atrocious.
Shoulders back, hips under stomach in, chest out chin up, knees straight.
Now then, remembering all these things raise the right leg even with the barre.
Even with the barre?
Even with the barre.
Now then, lower the leg slowly to the floor.
Madame, the leg down, a bas.
A bas!
A bas.
A bas!
A bas!
A bas!
A bas.
A bas, a bas.
A bas.
A- a-a bas!
A bas.
A bas!
A bas.
Where are you going?
No, no, no, no, there is much work to do.
There is?
Oui, you have great talent.
I have?
But there is much to do to get you in shape for the opening.
Now then, at the barre feet in first position.
Shoulders back, hips under stomach in, chest out chin up, knees straight.
Now then, plie.
And a one, a two, a three, a four a five, a six, a seven, eight  Hello.
Hello, Lucy.
How are you feeling today?
Can you move yet?
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
As a matter of fact I'm expecting my partner here any minute.
Your partner?
I thought you gave up ballet.
Oh, I did; that was too much work.
No, I called the Lido Theater and asked them to send over a comic to teach me a burlesque act.
Oh, somebody's at the door; maybe that's him.
I'll call you back later, Ethel.
Well, this must be the place.
Well, what time do the girls get here?
Uh, how do you do?
I'm Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, how do you do?
Where's the fella who wants me to teach him a bit?
Oh, right here.
Say, you're a nice-looking fella.
Thank you.
You see, I have a wonderful chance to get into a show if I can do a burlesque act.
Oh, I don't know about doing this bit with a dame.
These bit-bits are done by two men.
Well, couldn't you just pretend that I'm a man?
Okay, I got a good imagination.
Come here.
Here, this will help.
Try it on.
Okay.
Now, let's see.
What bit will we do?
How about "Slowly I turn"?
Slowly I turn?
What's that?
That's the name of the sketch.
Oh.
Want to try it?
All right.
There isn't much to it.
What do I do?
Well, I'll be sitting here on this park bench here.
You come along, tell me I look down in the mouth.
Ask me if you can help.
Yeah, well, what happens then?
Well, the rest of it sort of takes care of itself.
Okay.
Want to try it?
Yeah.
Uh, you look down in the mouth.
Can I help you?
Stranger, you have a kind face.
Would you like to hear my story?
Say, "Yeah.
" Yeah.
Okay.
I wasn't always a bum.
Once I was handsome like you.
Then she came into my life.
It was love at first sight.
And we were married and very happy until one night, there came a knock at the door.
I opened it.
A stranger was there.
I vowed to make my home his home.
And that was the beginning of the end.
One night when I returned home from work I found the usual note.
The stranger had stolen my wife away.
Then the search began.
I followed them all over the world Until one day I saw them at Niagara Falls- that beast and my lovely wife.
I never mention her name because when I do everything turns black in front of me.
I'm possessed with a lust to kill.
That's why I never mention her name.
But it's the same as George Washington's wife.
Martha?
Martha that's it, Martha.
Slowly I turned step by step, inch by inch I crept up on the beast who had ruined my life.
I looked around for a rock.
I grab one, I let him have it.
Revenge was all I had on my mind.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
What's the matter with you?
Oh.
Oh, you're not him.
No!
You're the one with the kind face.
Yeah!
I'm sorry.
I'm not well.
Well, that's all right, I understand.
I guess it might have been quite a shock to you thinking about Martha.
Martha!
Slowly I turned step by step inch by inch, I crept up on him.
I looked around for another rock.
I grab it.
I let him have it once more.
Revenge, that's all I wanted.
Stop!
Stop it!
Give me that thing.
What's the matter with you?
Don't you remember me?
Oh, it's you.
Yeah, the one with the kind face.
I'm sorry.
I'm very weak.
I should have met you when I was stronger.
Yeah, you should have met me before you met Ma Oh.
I almost said "Martha.
" Slowly I turned step by step, inch by inch.
I looked around for a rock.
I couldn't find one.
So, I grabbed a handful of Niagara Falls and I let him have it.
Give me that thing.
That's enough of this.
I agree with you.
It's too much.
I'm ashamed of myself.
Well, you ought to be.
Look at me, I'm a mess.
That's a very strange way to react just because you hear the name Martha.
Martha!
Slowly I turned step by step, inch by inch I crept up on him.
I let him have it.
I let him Drop it!
Drop it!
Drop it!
Drop it!
On the floor?
No, let me have it.
Okay.
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy or something?
You said to let you have it.
Oh!
Oh, you gotta You're a pretty good sport.
Here.
Now that you got the idea of the bit you want to try it again?
Yeah, but this time, you be the one with the kind face.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello, Lucy, Fred just called me and I think I ought to tell you before you get too involved Ricky hired those burlesque comics.
Ew  Well, some opening night, huh?
Yes.
Too bad Lucy was so stubborn.
She wouldn't even come down.
Did you see Ricky?
Yeah, but he couldn't talk to me.
Something went wrong backstage.
One of the ballet dancers took sick, and they don't know what they're going to do about the number.
Lucy knows that routine.
She learned it from Madame Lamand.
Gee, that would be a great break for her.
Yeah.
But what a terrible trick to play on Ricky.
It is not.
She'll be fine.
I'm going to call her up and tell her to come right now.
You go find Ricky and tell him you've got another dancer.
All right.
Hello.
Hello, Lucy, this is Ethel.
I'm down at the club.
Yeah.
The most exciting thing just happened.
One of the performers just got sick and can't do the act and you're the only one that knows the routine.
Routine?
You mean "Slowly I Turn"?
Yeah, all that turning stuff.
You learned it that day, didn't you?
I'll say.
Uh, what about my partner?
Oh, he's here.
Okay, I'll get my costume on, and I'll be right down.
Well, hurry up.
You'll just have time to make it.
Okay.
Linda flor de alborada Te brotaste del suelo Cuando la luz del cielo Tu capullo besaba De la rosa y el encanto El penso que te ama tanto Que ya loco de amor siente celos de la vez Del aire, del sol.
Marta, capullito de rosa Marta, del jardin linda flor Dime que feliz mariposa En tu caricia pulsa Arriata del sol Marta, que en tus claras pupilas Brilla una aurora de amor Marta, que en tus ojos azules De infatigable candor De buen huellos, adios.
Martha, rambling rose in the wildwood Martha, with a fragrance divine Rosebud of the days of my childhood Watch you bloom in the wildwood And I hope you'll be mine Martha, now your eyes beam at twilight Sparkling like the dew from a dawn Martha, well, I live for your love-light I awake with a sigh And I find you are gone Martha, Martha, Martha.
Ricky?
Well, hello, honey.
It's about time you got home.
Come in, dear.
Are you mad at me, honey?
Why, of course not, honey.
Are you sure?
Positive.
Come in, honey.
Ricky Ricardo!
Well, I guess I had it coming to me.
Now we're even.
Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Good morning, honey.
Good morning.
What are you doing up at the crack of dawn?
It's only 9:30.
Well, I'm trying to get out of here without that little monster from next door following me.
Little Peggy Dawson?
Yeah, yeah.
I can't get rid of her.
Ever since she found out that I'm Ricky Ricardo she's like a spook.
No matter where I go, she's there.
She walks with me to the subway in the morning she shows up at rehearsal and the way she looks at me- ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Well, you know how teenage girls are.
They get these fabulous crushes on men for no reason at all.
Yeah, well, I What do you mean, "for no reason at all"?
Oh, you know what I mean.
She thinks the sun rises and sets in you.
Of course, I don't know where she ever got the idea that you're the smartest, the handsomest the most talented man in the whole world.
Neither do I. There are a few other men smarter than I. Why, you big ham!
Well, anyway, I can't go through this cow-eyed routine for another morning.
I got to get out of here.
Oh, now, you've got plenty of time.
Nobody in their right mind would expect you to be up for another two hours yet.
Oh, I guess you're right.
Drink another cup of coffee.
I'll get your coat.
All right, honey.
Thank you.
Am I going crazy or something?
No.
Oh, Peggy.
Good morning Ricky.
Good morning.
Did I startle you?
Oh, no, no.
I always wash my hands in the coffee every morning.
My, that's interesting!
Yeah.
You go right ahead and eat your breakfast.
Don't let me bother you.
Now, look, Peggy, I-I have something to say to you.
What?
Uh Well, now, look, uh, uh, Peggy y- you're a very sweet girl, dear.
: Oh, you called me "dear"!
Now I can die happy.
Well, uh, look, look, Pe-Peggy Yes, Ricky darling.
I'll be right back.
: Lucy, Lucy.
What?
This is not my day.
Look, Lucy, will you do me a favor, honey?
: Oh, you called me "honey"!
Oh, now I can die happy.
Now, cut it out, will you?
May I have your autograph, Ricky?
Just tattoo it on my arm.
Now, that's enough of that, honey.
How am I going to get rid of her?
Why don't you disillusion her?
How?
Just go in there and be mean and nasty and unattractive.
I'm not that good an actor.
There must be some way.
Of course.
I know the perfect way for me to straighten her out.
How?
You talk to her.
Me?
Yep.
I got to go to rehearsal.
Good-bye, honey.
But Ricky, what'll I say?
Well, honey, you're so clever, you'll think of something.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, you coward.
Oh, Peggy Oh, Peggy, you scared me.
Is Mr. Ricardo ready to go to work?
He's gone.
Oh!
Gosh, I'll have to catch up with him.
Oh, now, Peggy, wait a minute.
But I walk him to the subway every morning.
Yeah, well, he's a big boy now.
He can find it by himself.
Uh, sit down, Peggy.
I want to have a little talk with you.
All right.
That's a good idea, really.
I want to have a talk with you, too.
Now, look, Peggy Mrs. Ricardo, let's be adult about this.
I'm in love with your husband.
Are you sure about what you're saying, Peggy?
Do you know it's love and not infatuation?
Oh, yes.
My infatuations only last a little while.
This has been going on for two whole weeks.
"Two whole weeks.
" Well, there's a little thing you overlooked, Peggy- Ricky is married.
I know.
Doesn't that make it sophisticated?
Well, yes.
And he's so much more worldly than the boys I know.
Well, I should hope so.
He's a little older, too.
I know- he's middle-aged.
What?
He must be pushing 23.
Yeah, he's pushing 23, all right.
In fact, he's pushed it all the way to 35.
I suppose you think that I'm pushing Oh, no.
A woman can always tell another woman's age.
Yes, well now, about Ricky.
You know, there's another thing you overlooked, Peggy.
What?
I love him, too.
I was afraid of that.
You're going to be terrific competition.
Well, thanks.
Gosh, you've got that certain something.
Well, that's-that's quite a compliment but, uh, how would a girl your age know that I have that certain something?
I can tell by the way my mother looks at my father when my father looks at you.
I hope we can get this settled by Saturday night so that Ricky can take me to the school dance.
Well, now, look, Peggy, I want to have a talk with you not as a rival but as a a A mother?
No, a friend.
Now, what about boys your own age?
Oh, they're all so icky.
They're icky, huh?
Yeah except Arthur!
Arthur?
Arthur Morton.
He's wonderful.
He's got curly hair, big sad eyes and floppy ears.
He looks like Gregory Peck.
Sounds more like Lassie.
But if you like Arthur so much why don't you go to the school dance with him?
Oh, he's too shy to ask me.
Well, why don't you ask him?
He doesn't know how to dance.
Oh.
Well, how about this?
Now, suppose someone taught him to dance by Saturday.
Would you ask him to take you?
Oh, sure.
Okay, I'll teach him.
Do you still know how to dance?
I think I can recall a few variations on the turkey trot.
Now, look, you tell Arthur to come here right after school and have his first lesson.
Okay.
Oh, gosh, I'm going to be late.
Oh, uh, Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes?
Don't say anything about Arthur.
I don't want Ricky to know that I'm untrue.
Well, your secret is safe, Peggy.
Gee, you're keen.
Bye.
"Gee, you're keen.
"  Arthur?
Come in, Arthur.
Come in.
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Ricardo.
Won't you sit down?
Can I get you a drink of water?
Arthur, say something!
I think I'm going to faint.
Now, nonsense.
There's nothing to be shy about.
I'm just going to teach you how to dance, that's all.
Well, look, we'll start this way.
Now, you just watch my feet.
Now, one, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
That's all there is to it.
Oh, is that all?
Yeah.
Now, you try it.
Now, one, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two Arthur, Arthur take shorter steps.
You'll be dancing with a girl, not an antelope.
Oh.
Now, try it again.
Now, one, two, three, four.
One, two, sidestep.
That's right, sidestep, that's it.
Gee, is this all there is to dancing?
Yes.
Well, this is easy.
Yeah, I knew you'd catch on.
There now.
Let's try it together.
Oh, now, come on, Arthur.
What are you going to do to me?
I'm not going to do anything to you.
We're just going to dance together.
You mean just the two of us?
Yes, that's the usual number.
Mrs. Ricardo, I can't dance with you.
: You're a a woman.
Yeah, my husband likes me that way.
Well, I don't know a a woman Now, look, Arthur some people are men and some people are women.
They're made that way so they can dance together.
Now, come on.
Take hold of me.
Oh, Arthur, we're not dancing the minuet.
Put your arms around me.
Oh, I couldn't.
Now, don't be silly.
Now, come on.
Now, just follow me.
Now, come on.
Now, one, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Arthur, relax.
Relax, now.
Loosen up, come on.
Just let yourself go loose, that's all.
Now, just relax.
Now, come on, follow me.
Now, relax.
Now, be light on your feet, now.
Li-Light on my feet.
Yeah.
Now, follow me.
One, two, three, four.

I'm sorry.
Oh, that's all right.
Okay.

Yeah.
Now, try it again.
Now, one, two, three, four.
One, two three, four One  Oh!

You don't think this last time broke it?
No, the first time broke it.
Well, I'll try to be more careful.
Okay, now, come on.
Light on my feet.
Yeah, light on your feet.
Come on.
One, two, three, four.
That's right, now you're getting it.
There, that's fine.
Now we'll try it with the music.
Well, Arthur, let me go.
Arthur, what's the matter with you?
Why don't you let me go?
I like it.
But, Arthur Mrs. Ricardo What?
I love you.
What do you mean, you love me?
I love you.
I love you!
Arthur, relax, now, relax.
Calm down.
Now, relax.
Gosh, this is the first time I've ever had my arms around a woman.
Now I know what all the fellas are talking about.
Now, Arthur.
I love you.
Stop saying that.
Now, Arthur, th-there's a big misunderstanding.
You better go now.
No, I'm never going away from you, ever.
Now, Arthur Let's dance some more.
No, no, you dance by yourself.
Oh, no.
Come on, now.
Let's see how much you've learned and then, maybe I'll dance with you.
Now, go on.
Well all right.
Now one, two, sidestep.
Three, four, sidestep.
That's it, sidestep.
Three, four, sidestep.
Sidestep, sidestep, sidestep.
That's it, sidestep, sidestep, three, four.
Sidestep, that's it.
The stairs!
Arthur, watch out for the st  Oh, no!
Hi, honey.
Hi.
What's the matter?
I gave Arthur a dancing lesson.
Arthur?
Arthur who?
Well, believe me, it wasn't Arthur Murray.
Would you mind telling a poor confused Cuban what you're talking about?
Well, after you left this morning I had that little chat with Peggy.
Yeah?
And she said that she liked a boy named Arthur Morton Yeah?
but that he didn't know how to dance.
So I had Arthur come over here and I gave him a dancing lesson to get Peggy off your neck.
What are you whispering about?
If my feet ever find out that it was my idea they'll kill me.
Well, I knew you'd figure a simple way to clear the entire situation.
Simple?
I may never walk again.
Well, listen, honey, thank you very much.
Can I forget about Peggy now?
I hope so.
Hey, you know, this Arthur was so shy I practically had to lasso him to get him in here.
No kidding?
Yeah.
It was really unbelievable.
And then, after we'd been dancing for a couple of minutes, he suddenly looked me in the eye and said, "I love you.
" Oh, no.
Yeah.
That's very funny.
In love with you!
That's a scream.
Ha, ha.
Oh, now, honey, you must admit it's pretty funny.
Look, I'll admit I'm old enough to be his sister but his being in love with me isn't that funny.
You fell in love with me once, you know.
I sure did, sweetheart.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Peggy.
Oh, Peggy, I don't know what you're Well, Peggy, I didn't mean to Oh, well, now, dear, you're jumping to concl But, Peggy, I Hello, Peggy?
Peggy?
Peggy is coming over.
What for?
She says now that I've taken Arthur away from her she ought to get you.
Well, why didn't you tell her not to come over?
I couldn't get a word in edgewise.
No, no, no, I'll get it this time.
Now, listen here, Peggy Oh, hello, Arthur.
Yeah, I know, Arthur.
Well, now, look, after all Now, look, Arthur, you can't Arthur?
Arthur is coming over, too.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
He said he wants to have a man-to-man talk with me about you.
Oh, swell, here we are in the middle of a four-sided triangle.
And it's all your fault.
This never would've happened if you hadn't learned to play that lousy conga drum.
Never mind that.
We got to figure a way to discourage them.
Well, pointing up that we're too old for them won't work.
I tried that with Peggy.
Didn't make the slightest impression.
Well, maybe, uh, you didn't make us old enough.
Hey, you know maybe you got something there, Grandpa.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what I mean, Grandma.
Hey, come on, we've got a lot of aging to do.
: Okay.
Well How is this?
That's pretty good but you can't talk with such a young voice.
Oh.
Uh : Is this any better?
Yeah, that's better but don't tell me a man your age still has teeth.
Oh, uh Is this all right, Grandma?
Oh, no!
I used to think I'd enjoy growing old with you but after this preview, you'd better grow old alone.
Never mind that.
Listen, how about you?
You don't look very old.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I have a few plans.
: I may misplace my teeth, too.
Well, that'll help.
Yeah, kiss me, Grandpa.
All right.
Ooh, there's one of them now.
All right.
Get out of sight.
Mrs. Ricardo, this is a terrible thing that you've done to me.
I'm disappointed in you.
Oh, well, girlie, I'm so sorry.
Sit down, we'll have a little talk.
What?
Oh, pardon me.
Oh, dear, I always forget those things.
There, now, sit down.
We'll have a girl-to-girl talk.
Those teeth, aren't they yours?
Well, they sure are.
I made the last payment two months ago.
Gosh, you're even older than I thought.
Well!
I can see why you're so afraid of losing Ricky but now that you've stolen Arthur I can't let that make any difference to me.
Well, I think you're absolutely right.
You do?
Absolutely, Ricky is yours.
Gee, Mrs. Ricardo, thanks.
Oh, that's all right.
It's really nothing.
I'll get him for you.
Oh, Peggy, I-I-I must, uh, warn you.
You know, Ricky isn't as young as you think he is either.
Oh, don't try to scare me, Mrs. Ricardo.
I've seen him when he comes in for breakfast.
Oh, well, he's all put together by then.
"Put together"?
Oh, yeah.
You should see him when he wakes up in the morning.
He's scattered all over the place.
Yeah, well, uh, you see us show people know a lot of makeup tricks.
We can look young whenever we want to.
Oh, you can't frighten me.
Well, all right, Peggy, have it your way.
I'll turn him over to you.
I'll go get him.
Oh Ricky is mine at last.
Ah, hello, Peggy.
Oh, Ricky, you're Old man!
Yes, yes.
Isn't that wonderful?
We'll be so happy together.
But Oh, but this must be some sort of a joke.
You must be Ricky Ricardo's father.
Oh, no, no, no.
It's me, all right  Yeah, the one and only Ricky Ricardo.
That's right, you show them, dear.
All right, Mother.
All right.
: iBabalu!
iBabalu, aye!
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
What's the matter?
Wh-What's the matter?
Well, it's his rheumatism.
Rheumatism?
Yeah, he has very Put his legs up on the coffee table there, will you, dear?
That's right.
Be careful, now, when you pull them.
Look out, now.
Watch out.
That's right.
Yeah, now, jiggle them.
"Jiggle them"?
Yeah, you have to keep them moving or his arteries harden.
Go ahead, jiggle them.
I'll fill this up, dear.
Thank you.
Oh, dear, I-I don't understand this whole thing.
Your hair, Ricky, when did it get white?
Oh, oh, that's right.
You never saw my hair this way, did you?
No.
Well, you see, I don't bother with the shoeblack at home.
Keep jiggling, Peggy.
Please, keep jiggling.
Is that better?
Yes, that's better.
You know, you're a much better jiggler than Lucy.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Okay.
All right.
I can't believe this whole thing.
Why, I just saw you at rehearsal yesterday dancing around and beating your conga drum.
Oh, yes.
Well I'm glad you saw that, yes.
That was my farewell performance.
Yeah, he's baba'd his last loo.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, I'll get it.
Keep jiggling.
Yeah, keep jiggling, please.
Where's Mr. Ricardo?
Look, Mr. Ricardo let's be adult about this.
I Ay!
What happened to him?
He's old.
This is the first time we've seen him without shoeblack on his hair.
Oh.
Well, look, Mr. Ricardo Oh, Arthur, not another word.
I'm happy.
I have Peggy.
Yeah.
Keep jiggling, Peggy.
Please, keep jiggling.
Go to Lucy, Arthur.
She's all yours.
Uh, we'll be very happy together, Arthur.
Of course, I'll miss the old gentleman.
He's the only one that knew how to put the batteries in my hearing aid.
Your hearing aid?
Yes.
You don't mind, do you?
Oh, no, no.
I still love you.
How's that?
I said, I still love you.
Oh, yes, sir, it sure does.
No!
I said, I still love you!
Oh, no.
Oh, no, thanks.
Never touch the stuff.
Peggy, please, keep jiggling, please.
I never knew you wore glasses.
How's that?
The glasses!
I said, I never knew you wore glasses!
Oh, well, I don't really need them.
I can see just as well without them.
Hello, Arthur?
Arthur?
Where'd he go?
Oh!
Oh, there you are.
Gee, Arthur th-they're both falling apart.
Well, Mrs. Ricardo doesn't look so old.
She's kind of well preserved.
At least her hair isn't white.
Oh, sonny, do you like my hair?
Yeah.
Well, here, you can have it.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Gee, two vanloads of furniture.
What can they do with so much junk?
Mmm.
Where'd they ever get that sofa?
Isn't that a?
Are you still hanging out that window?
Now, come on, honey I want my breakfast.
There's some coffee over there.
I'll make you some soft-boiled chairs in a minute.
What?
I mean, eggs.
Look at those chairs, will you, Ethel?
Ugh.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Hi, Ricks.
Hello, Fred.
Ethel up here?
Oh, there she is.
The nosy twins.
They've been hanging out that window for an hour, snooping.
You'd think they'd never seen anyone move into an apartment before.
Do you want some coffee?
No, thanks.
Ethel, look at those china lamps.
He shouldn't try to balance that lamp on that table like that.
Oh, honey, now, those moving men know what they're doing.
They never drop any   Oh Oh Well, I guess one lamp's better than none.
Ethel, come out of that window.
Suppose the new tenant should see you.
There's nobody down there but the moving men.
They won't be satisfied until they see every last bit of those people's, uh, paraphernalia.
Par Que no va a estar conforme hasta que no ven el ultimo trasto de los nuevos vecinos.
Oh, paraphernalia.
You understand Spanish?
No.
Now, come out of there, both of you.
Come on!
You've done enough snooping.
We're not snooping.
I'm surprised they're not using binoculars.
Oh, I forgot I had them.
Say, that must be the new tenant coming up now.
Isn't he handsome?
"Handsome"?
How can you call him handsome with those bugged-out eyes and long hairy legs?
Huh?
Hey, you got a fly on the lens.
Oh!
Ooh, say, he is handsome.
Let me see through those things.
Ethel!
Curiosity killed the cat, eh, Fred?
Yeah, but we'll never get a break like that.
Now, why can't they wait until tomorrow to see what those people look like?
I don't know.
It doesn't make any difference to me what they look like.
Me, neither.
Hey, who was that?
Do you suppose that could be his wife?
: Look at that gorgeous blond hair.
Ethel Mertz!
How do you dare let a woman like that that has a figure like that, come into this building?
Just a minute.
That's the biggest mista Nothing doing.
Give me that, will you?
Hey, fellas!
Fred, give me that thing!
Fellas, watch it, will you?
Gee, I'm sure glad men aren't nosy.
Yeah.
Wow, wow.
All right, fellas, break it up, will you?
We were here first.
Get your own window.
Ah they gone inside.
That's all, girls.
Yeah, the show is over.
Here.
Well, something tells me I'm going to be doing a lot of repairing in that apartment.
Ah You need a helper?
Have you got a card?
I'll join.
Okay, Ethel, what's the dirt on the new tenants?
Where are they from?
I don't know.
What business is he in?
I don't know.
Do they have any children?
I don't know.
What's the matter with you?
Your radar bent?
No, they rented the apartment through an agent.
All I know is their name is O'Brien she's a blond, and they've got one broken lamp.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go down and call on them.
Okay, let's go.
Now, now, wait a minute, Ethel.
Give them a chance to get settled.
Yeah, I guess he's right.
No sense rushing things.
Okay, let's go.
Lucy, come on!
Well, I'm trying to, but there's a very strong current here.
Ricky, let go.
Come here, Lucy.
You're not going to go downstairs.
Why not?
Because there's nothing downstairs that concerns you.
You'll have to give me a better reason than that.
You just go in the kitchen and fix my breakfast.
Oh we'll go down later, Ethel.
His majesty is hungry.
Okay, there's plenty of time.
His majesty has another proclamation.
I don't want you to go down there at all.
"At all" as in "never"?
Right.
Now, repeat after me: I, Lucy Ricardo, promise never to set foot in the O'Brien apartment.
Oh, really.
Come on.
I, Lucy Ricardo, promise never to set foot Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Uh-huh.
Now.
I, Lucy Ricardo, promise never to set foot in the O'Brien apartment- okay?
Okay.
Information.
Do you have a telephone number for O'Brien, 623 East 68th Street?
They just moved in today.
One moment, please.
Fred, are you going to be long?
I want to use the phone.
No, no, I'll just be a minute.
I thought I'd call downstairs and see if there's anything they wanted me to do Are you calling the O'Briens?
They'll call you if they want anything done.
You're never too busy to do anything when there's a blond around.
Are you calling them?
How can you think a thing like that?
Oh, hello, Mr. Thompson?
How's the plumbing holding up down there?
Well, good.
No, no, no, not at all, thanks.
Help yourself.
The number for the O'Briens is Murray Hill 5-9-5-7-0.
Stick 'em up.
Tom, you scared me to death.
Hiya, baby.
Hi.
Put this on the mantel for me, will you?
Forget about unpacking.
We've got a script to learn.
But, Tom, this place Look, honey, this television show goes on Friday night.
We don't even know our lines yet.
Well, I know mine.
All right, smarty.
I'll help you with yours.
Good.
Now, let's see.
I think I know that first scene, baby.
Let's start with the second one.
All right.
Now, where are we?
: Are you sure this is the right place?
: I am positive.
They live in this building on an upper floor.
Good.
Let me go over the plan with you once more.
We do away with them both- dispose of the bodies and assume their identities.
We become them, yes?
Exactly.
It is dangerous but it is our only chance to stay in this country so we can blow up the capital.
Shh!
: You know, that's pretty corny dialogue.
Yeah, even for television.
Well, it's a living.
Let's see, where were we?
: You know, my little chicken, this job will not be easy.
They're clever and physically strong.
: "Physically strong" "Physically strong" Yeah, I thought you knew your part, baby.
That's the first one I've missed.
It's, "Especially " : Especially the red-haired one.
Did you notice those big bulging muscles those-those popping eyes and-and that horrible, ugly, leering face?
I will take care of that one, silently with a knife in the back.
You will handle the other.
I will, on one condition- that you take me out to lunch.
Huh?
It's 3:00 and I'm starved.
Ah.
I haven't had anything to eat since breakfast.
All right.
Come on, let's go down to the drugstore and have a sandwich.
We can finish rehearsing when we get back.
Okay, baby.
: I will take care of that one, silently with a knife in the back.
Hey  Oh.
: Wait.
Good, they have not seen us.
The coast is clear.
: Darling, you're such a fool.
You know, baby, I think we're going to like this place.
Mrs. O'Brien?
Mrs. O'Brien, it's me, the landlady.
Is there anything I can help you with?
Mrs. O'Brien?
Ew.
: Hi, Ethel.
Lucy.
What about your promise?
Well, I promised Ricky I wouldn't set foot in this apartment but that doesn't mean I can't stay out here in the hall and give a long-distance snoop.
Aren't they home?
No.
I had to wait all morning and half the afternoon for them to leave.
: What'd you find?
Well Lucy, what period is this?
Looks like 20th-century ugly.
What else is there?
These lamps.
Now that I see these lamps up close it's too bad they didn't drop both of them.
Where are they?
Here.
Oh Gosh, this is the most frustrating thing that ever happened to me.
Wait, I'll bring one over to you.
No, listen- just because I promised Ricky that I wouldn't set foot in this apartment doesn't mean I can't set knees in.
So long as I keep my feet off the floor I'm an honest woman, right?
He better see his dentist.
Oh, fine thing- she removed all the price tags.
Hey, look at this.
What is that?
Early Pullman.
Lucy!
Ricky's home.
Lucy!
He's coming down here.
What'll I do?
Hide someplace.
I'll get rid of him.
But where?
In the closet.
Oh, hi, Ethel.
I have a perfect right to be here.
Who said you didn't?
Well, uh : I just came up to see if everything was all right, and everything's all right.
Well, let's go.
You seen Lucy?
Lucy who?
Lucy Ricardo, my wife.
Oh, that Lucy.
Yeah, that Lucy.
No, I haven't seen her.
Let's go.
: Are you sure this is the right place?
I am positive.
They live in this building on an upper floor.
MR.
O' Good.
Let me go over the plan with you once more.
We do away with them both- dispose of the bodies and assume their identities.
MRS.
O' We become them, yes?
Exactly.
It is dangerous but it is our only chance to stay in this country so we can blow up the capital.
Shh!
You know, my little chicken this job will not be easy.
They are clever and physically strong.
Especially the red-haired one.
Did you notice did you notice those big bulging muscles those popping eyes and that horrible, ugly, leering face?
I will take care of that one, silently with a knife in the back.
You will handle the other.
Do not worry.
In a dark alley a loop of silver wire around the neck.
One tug- poof!
Wait I do not know if you actually realize the importance of this mission.
What a great honor it is for you and I to have been chosen to perform it.
It is a crowning glory.
It makes us the most trusted agents in our nation's service.
I am overwhelmed with pride.
Darling when this assignment is over and we return to our native homeland I will tell you something that I have wanted to say to you for a long, long time.
Tell me now.
No, there is no time for personal emotion.
We have a job to do.
That is all that counts.
Tell me now.
No.
I think I can guess.
What do you think it is?
Tell me.
No, guess.
Kiss me.
Ah, you guessed.
Enough of this.
We are on a sacred mission.
We cannot be weak.
You are right but I'll remember this until we can be weak again.
Now, my little chicken are all our preparations in order?
Now, my little chicken Now, my little chicken, are all our preparations in Now, my little chicken, are all our preparations in order?
You have the knife?
Yes.
The silver wire?
Yes.
The map?
Yes.
The explosives?
Yes.
The two-way wrist television set?
Yes.
Good.
I cannot I cannot think as a patriot.
My blood is pounding in my ears.
As a woman, I beg of you be weak again.
The roar of my blood is loud and deep.
What a tragedy my life has been up to now.
I see for the first time that to love is to live.
: Hey, not bad, eh?
That's gin.
Aw, Ricky.
That's all.
Oh, no, let's play one more hand, Ricky, huh?
All right.
Oh, there you are, Ethel.
Have you got the pass key?
I want to check the heat in Miss Lewis's apartment.
Lucy, what are you doing?
They're after us.
Help me.
Well, what happened?
What are you talking about?
Who's after who?
The O'Briens, Ethel.
You're nurturing two vipers in your brownstone bosom.
What?
Lucy have you been snooping downstairs?
Yes, I've been snooping and it's a good thing I did, too.
Those people are foreign enemy agents.
They're going to rub us out and they're not going to use an eraser either.
Lucy, you mean to tell me that you went downstairs after you promised me not to?
Yes, I've been a bad girl and you can spank me tomorrow if there's anything left to spank!
Well, didn't you hear what I said?
What's the matter with you?
Our lives are in danger!
Now, look, honey why would those people want to give us a rubdown?
Rub us out!
I heard them.
They're going to kill us and assume our identities.
Why?
So they can blow up the capital.
"Blow up the capital.
" Yes!
Now, look, honey Now, wait a minute.
Maybe we better pay attention to Lucy.
After all, she was in their apartment.
Yeah, and I'm going to call the police.
I got to get them over here.
We got to save the country.
Now, now, look, honey, calm down, will you?
Let's talk this thing over.
Now, wait a minute.
A lot of talking you're going to do with a silver wire wrapped around your neck.
Silver wire?
Yeah!
Aw, honey, you better lie down.
Come on, now.
I don't want to lie down!
If I go, I want to be go standing up fighting.
I think it's time to turn on the furnace.
Good luck, Rick.
And you go with him, Ricky.
All right.
I'll try to settle her down.
Ricky, you're not going to leave me at a time like this!
When you come back, I might be gone!
Well, if you go, leave me a note and tell me where I can find my clean socks.
Ricky!
Why won't anybody believe me?
Oh I'm telling you I heard.
Oh, come on, now, honey.
I heard it!
I heard it!
Calm down.
I know what I heard!
Now, Lucy, are you sure you heard right?
Cross my heart and hope to Oh!
Oh, dear.
Well, I'm not going to sit here like a sitting duck.
I'm going to call the police.
Operator, give me the police.
Sergeant Morton speaking.
Help!
Name, please.
Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Send a squad of men over right away.
Send two squads, the whole force.
Address?
Now, Mrs. Ricardo, what seems to be your trouble?
Well some people that moved in downstairs are plotting to kill us.
Do you know these people?
No.
Then, how do you know they're going to kill you?
I heard them.
I- I just happened to be hiding in their closet at the time.
I see.
And why do you suppose they want to kill you?
So they can assume our identities and blow up the capital.
This is serious.
You're darn right it is!
These people are agents of some foreign government.
What's their names?
O'Brien.
Lady, have you been nipping on the cooking sherry?
Oh, please, you've got to believe me.
I'm-I'm living on borrowed time.
It was only by a very clever ruse that I managed to escape from their apartment right under their eyes.
And how did you manage that?
I pretended to be a chair.
I don't think the police can help you, madam.
Why don't you call an upholsterer?
Oh, Officer, please, I'm serious.
My life is at stake.
What'll I do?
Just relax.
Take it easy and in time, you may grow up to be a nice big sofa!
But, Officer Oh, Officer!
Oh, come on, now, Lucy.
Aw, nobody will believe me.
Come on, honey don't you think a good hot bath and a nice rest I keep telling you what's happening will help you relax?
but nobody will believe me!
But, after all, Lucy To arms!
To arms!
To arms!
To arms!
What happened?
Lucy's right!
Lucy's right!
We listened through the furnace pipe.
Yeah!
See?
Yeah, th-they are planning to kill us and blow up the capital!
Yeah, well, now, maybe you'll believe me when I tell you something.
I'm going to call the police right away!
I just did.
They don't care a darn about it.
Well, they're not going to get us without a fight.
I'm going to get my rifle!
Yeah, and I got two shotguns downstairs and I'll get them, too.
All right, bring both of them.
Lock the doors and shut all the windows!
Yeah.
Lock the doors and shut all the windows.
well!
10:00 in the bedroom and all's well!
10:00 in the hallway and all's well!
: 10:00 in the kitchen and all's well!
Kitchen sentry, report to the living room.
Yes, sir.
Ethel, are you eating on duty?
No, sir.
What's that in your hand?
Um Well, I'm not very good with a gun and I thought if anybody sneaked in through the back door I'd beat them to death.
Well, I hope they get here before you eat your club away.
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.
Fred, what are you doing away from your post?
I'm hungry and I request transfer to the kitchen.
What do you want?
I'm lonesome in there all by myself.
What's that?
I hear something.
I do, too.
Be calm.
Be calm.
Be steady.
Take it easy.
Don't get excited.
Now, don't shoot till you see the whites of their eyes.
Okay.
Take it easy.
Okay.
Okay.
Hello?
No, this isn't the city dump.
You got the wrong number.
Very clever ruse of theirs to find out if we're home or not.
Right.
Hey, hey.
Go around.
Come here.
What's the matter?
Someone's at the door.
Okay.
Be careful.
Be steady.
Be calm.
Get ready.
Just don't be trigger-happy now.
Oh?
Don't shoot till it's absolutely necessary.
All right.
All right?
Okay.
Okay.
Good morning, folks.
Good morning.
Well, I finally got this thing straightened out.
You have?
You did?
What?
Great.
Yeah.
The O'Briens are actors.
What you heard was a play they were rehearsing.
Eww!
You can go now.
Mr. Mertz.
Yeah?
The O'Briens told me to tell you they're moving out of your apartment.
Aw fine.
This is all your fault, Lucy.
Yes, and you'll pay that rent till we get another tenant.
And one of your trigger-happy sentinels shot a hole in the hot water pipe.
Your whole apartment is flooded.
And she'll pay for that, too!
Oh, come on, Fred, we better hurry home.
Uh, you must be the famous, uh, Ricky Ricardo.
Oh, you heard about me, eh?
In the paper this morning.
Oh, in the paper.
Front page.
"Orchestra Leader Jailed in Shooting Spree.
" Cuando la lleve a la casa le voy a cortar la cabeza en dos pedazos.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.
Come on, sweetheart.
Let's go home.
Come on, lady, you can go out in the world now.
Nobody's going to kill you.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.
Come on, sweetheart.
Lock the door, Officer.
I like it better in here.

Lucy, who is it?
Some people.
Lucy Whom is coming here for dinner tonight?
Whom, you mean, besides meem and youm?
Never mind that.
What are their names?
Fred and Ethel Mertz.
Wait a minute.
I thought you said Fred and Ethel had a big fight and they were mad at each other.
They are.
I thought you said they weren't speaking to each other.
They aren't.
And that he was staying at the Y. He is.
And she won't let him in the house.
She won't.
Well, if they are and they aren't and he is and she won't- how come?
Well, I thought Lucy Esmeralda Macgillicuddy Ricardo.
Yes?
I thought we had an understanding that you were not going to mess around in other people's affairs.
But, Ricky Lucy, sometimes I think that you don't have anything inside your head.
Now, come on.
Let me see.
Hey, that picture on the wall is crooked.
Oh, stop.
Now, Ricky, I can't stand seeing them apart like this.
I heard Ethel downstairs crying all morning.
I'll bet Fred's eating his heart out too.
Hah!
What do you mean, hah?
How would you like to be separated from me for three whole days.
Ah!
Oh Now really, Ricky, it's up to us to get Fred and Ethel back together again.
Say you'll help me.
Well, it would be nice.
Yeah.
And I guess after you've gone through all this trouble and this far that the cast is dead.
"The cast is dead"?
Yeah, you know Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.
The die is cast.
That's what I said.
Oh, fine.
Now, tell me, Dorothea Dix if they are not speaking to each other how did you get them to come here for dinner?
Neither one knows that the other one is coming.
Oh, that should be interesting.
Yoo-hoo.
There's one of the lovebirds now.
Yeah, before the evening is over there'll be feathers flying all over the place.
Oh, now, stop.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi, Ricky.
Hello, Ethel.
Let me take your coat, honey.
Thanks.
Here, I'll take it, dear.
Gee, you look beautiful.
It was nice of you to ask me to dinner.
I almost didn't make it.
I just got home.
I've been so busy socially, you know dancing every night luncheons and teas every afternoon.
Oh, really?
Oh, yes.
I've been having a wonderful time.
Oh, bread.
I haven't eaten since he left.
Oh, really?
Gee, you sure must miss him.
I do not.
He didn't leave me any money, the big fat slob.
Well, we'll eat right away, dear.
Good.
Oh, four places, is someone else coming?
Well, I-I didn't tell you, Ethel but I've invited a fascinating man for you.
He's a real dream.
Oh, Lucy, you shouldn't have done that.
After all, I'm still a married woman.
What's he like?
I'm not going to tell you.
I want you to be surprised.
She will be.
Oh, this is exciting.
I better go powder my nose.
He's a real dream, huh?
Uh-huh.
Can I put on some of your good perfume?
Sure.
Well, you really cooked one up this time.
Now, don't worry.
Everything's going to be all right.
You know what'll happen?
Yeah, they'll kill each other right in front of our eyes.
They will not.
That must be the other lovebird now.
Hi, Rick.
Hello, Fred.
How are you?
Gee, I'm glad to see you.
We sure miss you around here.
How's everything down at the Y?
Oh, fine, fine, thanks.
Hi, Lucy.

You're welcome.
I was going to call up and say hello but I've really been having a time.
Really?
Yeah.
You really been living it up, eh?
Have I?
Rick, I'm a free man again.
You wouldn't believe the things I been doing.
What have you been doing?
Everything I did before I was married.
No kidding?
Yeah, handball, basketball, badminton, squash I'm pooped.
Gee, when do we eat?
I- I've been living on peanut butter sandwiches.
Oh, are you expecting somebody else?
Well, um, yes, Fred.
I- I-I took the liberty of inviting a nice young lady to be your dinner companion.
A young lady?
Yeah, a cute young chick.
Oh.
Well, bring her on.
Ho, ho, ho.
A young chick, huh?
Am I ready.
Yoo-hoo, he's here.
Come on out now.
What are you doing here?
Lucy, is that my date?
He's no dream; he's a nightmare.
Is that your idea of a cute young chick?
You'll never shop for my poultry.
Aw, now come on.
As long as we're all here why don't we sit down and eat?
Yeah, come on, Ethel.
No, thanks, I just lost my appetite.
Me too.
I'm leaving.
Where's my coat?
Where's my coat?
Well, all right, Ricky, get their coats.
Okay.
Here you are, Fred.
Well, thanks.
Here you are, Ethel.
Thank you.
Well, as long as she's leaving I guess I could stay and help you eat that food.
You're not letting him stay and do you out of this beautiful roast beef are you, Ethel?
Um, no, why should I?
Good.
Let's everybody sit down.
That a girl.
Give me that coat.
Yeah, Fred, you sit over here by me.
Well, thanks.

Now, let's see here.
How's that, Ethel?
Not too much fat is there?
There certainly is.
He means the meat.

Oh, thanks.
Here you are, Ethel.
Thank you.
Here you are, Fred.
Thank you.
Ah, potatoes.
Nice and hot too.
And beans.
No potatoes, Ricky?
No, I'm strictly a meat man.
What about you, Fred?
Thank you, Lucy.
Thank you.
Okay, string beans?
If it weren't for you I wouldn't get anything to eat.

He pushed me off the bench, that's what happened.
I did not.
She fell off.
Oh, that does it.
Roast beef or no roast beef, I'm leaving.
Don't bother, I'll go.
Oh, you don't have to go Ethel, Ethel, please.
Ricky, I guess this was a bad idea of mine.
Let's get their coats.
All right.
Here you are, Fred.
Thanks.

Untie this coat.
Not until you kiss and make up.
I'll never speak to him again after the things he said to me.
What about the things you said to me?
She said my mother looks like a weasel.
Apologize, Ethel.
No.
Oh, come on, Ethel.
Tell him you're sorry.
Well, I'm sorry your mother looks like a weasel.
Now, Ethel Well, he should have more consideration.
After all, I gave him the best years of my life.
Were those the best?
All right, all right, now you're even.
Now, what are your terms for making up, Ethel?
Well, let him apologize.
He started it.
I did not.
You did too.
I did not!
I never All right!
All right.
It doesn't matter who started it.
What matters is how it got started.
What was it all about?
Well Uh I was, uh, uh He said, uh I forget.
So do I. You see, you can't even remember.
Well, it wasn't how it started.
It was the things we said afterward.
I'm sorry, Fred.
I apologize, honey bun.
Sweetie pie.
Baby doll.
Sugar lips.
You know, this is pretty sickening.
I liked them better when they were mad.
Let's get back to the dinner.
Now we can eat.
Dinner is getting cold.
Doesn't that food look great?
Aren't quarrels silly?
They sure are, honey.
When's the last time we had a fight, Ricky?
Gosh, I don't remember, dear.
Neither do I. See, why don't you two be like us?
That's a good idea.
I'll dye my hair red and Fred can speak with an accent.
Well, if I remember correctly you two had your spats.
Well Ricky only got to go to the fights with me last month because you weren't speaking to each other.
Oh, yeah.
But it didn't last long.
No, I gave in and put an end to it.
Yeah, you want some more gravy, Ethel?
What'd you say, Ricky?
You put an end to it?
I was the one who gave in.
Oh, pardon me, honey, but, uh I was the one that called the whole thing off, remember?
You?
I went all the way down to your club to apologize- remember?
Well, honey, that was after- you went down all the way to the club and apologized- after I sent you a dozen roses with a card saying that I was wrong, remember?
Before, darling.
After, baby.
Before, dear.
After, sweetheart.
Before.
After.
Before.
It's your serve.
After!
I remember how tough it was to-to-to-to write that card saying that I was wrong when I was right.
Oh, you thought that you were right?
I certainly did, and I still do.
Well, it's good to know that I'm married to a hypocrite.
Hypocrite?
What's a hypocrite?
A person who says one thing and means another.
Thanks.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, now, Ricky take it easy.
She can't talk to me that way.
But she's excited.
That's no excuse.
That's plenty 'scuse.
And don't you make fun of my English.
Hmm, that's English.
Si, es ingles, yo hablo muy bien, muy perfectamente.
Usted no me tiene que decir que no hablo bien.
How dare you say that to me.
What did I say?
I don't know, but how dare you!
I'll show you who gives in first in this family.
Mira que me decia a mi que yo no se hablar ingles cuando lo he estudiado perfectamente en todas las universidades muchisimos anos.
Yo hablo mejor que toda la gente que esta sentada en la mesa aqui.
And whenever you're ready to call me and apologize you can call me down at the club!
Don't hold your breath!
Ha!
Fred, Fred, we'd better go.
Yes, yes No, no, no, don't go.
We'll just finish our dinner.
Certainly not going to let him spoil a dinner for us.
This meat is cooked just the way I like it nice and juicy.
Yoo-hoo.
Lucy, where are you?
I'm in the bedroom.
Good morning.
Morning.
Oh You've been crying.
I have not.
A rabbit should have such pink eyes.
I'm getting a cold.
Oh.
I gather Ricky didn't come home last night.
You mean that funny-looking Cuban that used to hang around here?
Yeah, that's the guy I had reference to.
No, he didn't come home last night and he didn't call this morning.
Not that it makes any difference to me.
Oh, I can see it doesn't matter to old indifferent you Why don't call him up and tell him you're sorry?
What?
Swallow my pride?
Call him up and go crawling back to him?
Hah!
Well Besides, the line was busy.
I thought so.
Call him up again.
I will not.
Why not?
I called him once; now it's his turn.
What if he never calls you?
Then we'll just never see each other again.
Oh, we can't have that.
Now, let's see.
I could invite you both to dinner without telling the other but that's been done a lot lately.
Yeah, that's a pretty stale bit.
I know, we'll use the old sympathy routine.
Sympathy routine?
Yeah.
You know how families are- no matter what differences they've had they always unite in cases of sickness, accident and terrible tragedy.
What are you talking about?
I'll call up Ricky and tell him you've been run over by a bus.
Run over by a bus?
Yeah.
Well, that seems rather drastic.
Oh, we'll only pretend.
Oh.
I'll wrap you all up in bandages and then I'll call him up and tell him you've had a terrible accident.
That'll bring him back.
Well, it might work.
It can't miss.
Have you got plenty of adhesive tape and bandages in the house?
Well, that all depends.
On what?
On what kind of a bus I get hit by, local or express.
You like the peanut butter sandwiches they serve here, Rick?
Kind of stick to the roof of your mouth, don't they?
Yeah.
Oh, just give me a small grape juice.
It's none of my business, Rick, but this is silly.
Why don't you break down and call Lucy?
What?
And give her the satisfaction of knowing that I gave in first?
Well, I was just thinking.
Besides, the line was busy.
Well, what do you want to do?
Go through life with a sticky upper plate?
There are other places to eat besides this drugstore, you know.
You know what I mean.
I know all about this business.
Why don't you swallow your pride?
I'm having enough trouble with this sandwich.
If only we could think of a way to bring you two together without making you make up first.
Let's give this a good think.
Yeah.
We're very noisy thinkers.
If only the apartment would catch on fire and you could rush in and save Lucy.
What'd she put in there?
No, I saw it last week on television.
This girl couldn't stand this guy until he saved her life in a fire.
Then she was so grateful, she married him.
Well, thanks, Fred, that's a swell idea but I hardly think that I will set your apartment building on fire.
Of course, that's it.
You must be daffy or heavily insured.
Oh, you don't understand.
We just pretend to set the apartment on fire.
How do you pretend to have a fire?
It's easy.
That strap tight enough, Lucy?
I guess so.
How about this?
A little tighter.
How's that?
Okay.
This comfortable?
Yeah.
Now, put your arm in this sling.
Oh.
There.
Okay.
That's great.
You look fine.
I hope you got the number of the bus that hit me.
You know you look like you really were hit.
And dragged nine blocks.
Come on, now, get in bed.
Oh, here, I'll help you.
Get your legs up.
Want another pillow?
Yeah.
Oh.
How's that?
Okay.
Ooh I got an itch.
Where?
Right under my arm.
Right back there.
Right there, to the right, to the right.
Over, over, up.
Over?
Ah!
Oh!
Thanks.
I got to go before Ricky gets home.
Are you sure he's coming, Ethel?
I called the club, and they said he was out but they'd give him the message.
Well, I hope he hurries.
Are you okay?
Okay?
I've been in a terrible accident.
Good luck.
She must be in the bedroom.
Pull that couch out of there.
Okay.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
That ought to do it.
Hook up the fan.
Okay.
Here, here's the switch.
Right in here.
I got it.
Go ahead.
Think this ought to do it?
Yeah, looks like it.
Help, fire, the building's on fire.
Run for your lives!
Hey, what's going on here?
What's going on here?
Ricky, I'm glad you're here.
Lucy's trapped in the bedroom.
Well, I'm going to go in there and save her.
No, no, the whole place is a solid wall of flames.
I'm going in there no matter what you say.
Hold him, men, hold him.
Let me go, let me go.
I'm going in there and save my wife.
Stand back.
You'll be burned to a cinder.
I'm going in there, men, let me go.
I'm going in there no matter what happens.
Careful, everybody the whole building is beginning to crumble.
I'm going in no matter what happens to me.
Let me go, let me go, let me go, fellows.
Don't hold me back.
Do you think it's time to go in?
Yeah.
All right.
I'm going in there.
Lucy, don't worry.
I'm coming in to save you.
Right now.
Here we go.
Where are you, Lucy?
Where are you?
Are you in there?
She's not here.
She's not in there.
Well, how do you like that.
We went through all that trouble and she wasn't even here.
Gee, honey, now are you sure those bandages are fake?
Uh, yeah, honey.
Are you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
Here, honey, let me help you.
It's a good thing the Mertzes had their awning up.
Aw, honey, it was all my fault.
No, it was my fault, honey.
Weren't we silly?
Yeah, we'll never argue again.
No, baby.
Are you okay, Lucy?
Yeah, Fred, I'm fine.
Sure?
Sure.
Oh, thank heavens you're all right.
Why?
What's the matter?
Well, when I told Ethel the whole gag was my idea she got mad and went home to her mother.
Oh!
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Hurry up, dear.
The Mertzes will be here any minute.
I'll be ready, honey.
I was just shaving so I look real nice when I go out with my wife.
Well, isn't that sweet?
I thought you said you shaved.
I did.
What's the matter with your upper lip?
Is it out of bounds?
You mean my moustache?
Your what?
My moustache.
Ricky, it's true.
Your upper lip has whiskers on it.
What do expect, feathers?
No, I expect you to go in there and shave it off.
You know I don't like a moustache on you.
Why not?
Because it looks like an eyebrow and your mouth keeps staring at me.
Well, I guess it could use a little eyebrow pencil until it gets stronger.
Listen, now, we're going to have this out right now.
You're going in there and shave that off?
No.
Come here.
Oh, darn it.
It's still there.
I thought maybe I could singe it off.
Oh, honey, you'll love my moustache once you get used to it.
I will not.
Well, honey, just wait till it gets a little strunger.
It's never get "strunger.
" You've tried this before, Ricky.
You know you always end up looking like a little boy who drank chocolate milk.
Well, you never let me give it a chance.
This time, I'm going to cultivate it.
What are you going to use on it- Vigoro?
Never mind that.
I look wonderful in a moustache.
You just look silly in a moustache, Ricky.
I do not.
Here are the Mertzes.
Let's see what they think.
All right, we'll see.
Well, we'll just see.
Just don't put any words in their mouth.
Don't worry, I won't have to.
Okay.
Hi, folks.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi, Ricky.
Hiya.
Hi.
Are you ready to go to the movies?
You are just in time to settle something.
We are?
Yeah?
Yes.
As two impartial observers we'd like your opinion on something.
Yeah.
Well, I'll be happy to g Ricky, you're growing a moustache.
Gee, it looks wonderful.
Well, let me see.
Hey, that looks great.
Now, what did you want our opinion on?
Nothing, Benedict Ethel.
Well, Ricky and I just had a big, fat argument about how ridiculous he looks in that moustache and then you had to come in and louse up everything.
Well, I think he looks handsome.
I do too.
So do I. Brother.
Besides, I have a very good reason for growing this moustache.
What is it?
He wants a divorce.
You'll change your tune when you see me as the star of the new Technicolor motion picture Moon over Baghdad.
Ricky!
You didn't tell me you were going to star in a moving picture.
Well, I was keeping it spring it on you as a surprise, you know?
You know when you're leaving for Hollywood?
Well, not exactly.
Have you signed your contract yet?
Well, not exactly.
But they've agreed to star you.
Well, not exactly.
Well, what exactly?
Well, a talent scout from Hollywood is coming to town to look for someone to star in the picture and my agent has a friend whose brother-in-law knows the talent scout's wife.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's pack.
Star you in a picture.
Well, don't you worry.
I'll get an appointment to see him.
Yeah, you'll get an appointment if the agent's friend's brother-in-law is still speaking to this talent scout's wife.
Gee, a real, live talent scout from Hollywood.
Hey, Rick- ask him if he can use a song-and-dance man.
And don't forget about me.
I used to do an oriental dance.
La-dee-da-da, da-da-da, da, da-da-da I was known as "The Queen of the Nile.
" Oh!
She's a little rusty around Cairo.
Oh, you!
All right, come on, are we going to go to the movies or not?
I'm not leaving here till you shave off that silly moustache.
Honey baby doll I'm not going to shave it off so why don't you just relax and enjoy it?
I mean it, Ricky.
I'm not leaving here.
Now, Lucy.
No!
All right.
We'll go without her.
Come on.
You two go ahead.
I'll stay here with Lucy.
All right.
Good-bye, Ethel.
Come on, Fred.
Bring me a bag of popcorn Okay.
with lots of butter.
Yeah, yeah.
Got 20 cents, Rick?
Come on.
Darn that Ricky.
I'll get rid of his cookie-duster somehow.
You know, my grandfather used to have a moustache- a great, big, long handlebar one- and Grandma got rid of it in the middle of the night.
How?
She tied it around a bedpost when he was asleep and then yelled "fire.
" Oh!
Oh, Ethel!
Hey, that gives me an idea though.
It does?
Yeah.
Ricky's not going to be the only one in this family with a moustache.
What?
I'm going to glue on a false one and I'm not going to take it off till he shaves off his.
Lucy, congratulations.
What for?
You've finally topped yourself.
This is the craziest idea you've had yet.
Lucy!
Where are you?
I'm in here.
Where have you two been?
Ricky will be home any minute.
We had a hard time finding it.
It was down at the bottom of my vaudeville trunk.
Well, give it here.
Let's see now.
I'll have to cut off the beard.
Oh, no, you don't.
You can't cut that, Lucy.
Those things are expensive.
Well, I can't wear the whole thing.
Why not?
Yeah, why not?
Yeah, why not?
Uncle Sam wants you.
Show me how to stick it on, Fred.
All right.
This is spirit gum.
Look, I just put a little on your upper lip here.
Oh, that smells awful.
Lucy, I'm home.
Be right there.
Hi, dear.
Hi, honey.
How's about giving me a nice big kiss?
There's nothing I  What's the matter?
I thought you were going to kiss me.
Lucy, where did you get that thin'?
What "thin"?
Those whiskers.
What whiskers?
These.
Oh, these.
Oh, my five-o'clock shadow?
Guess I didn't give myself a very close shave this morning.
All right, Lucy.
What are you up to?
Nothing, nothing.
I'm just growing this so that I can get a part in that Technicolor movie called Moon Over the North Pole.
I'm going to play Santa Claus.
Okay, okay, joke's over.
Now, take that ridiculous thing off your face.
It makes you look like a freak.
Oh, you think it looks funny, huh?
I certainly do.
Well, now you know how your moustache looks to me.
Oh, so that's it, huh?
Well, your little gag didn't work.
So just take it off.
Nothing doing.
I'm not taking it off till you shave off yours.
Well, I'm not shaving.
Neither am I. Of course, we'll have to change our name to the Smith Brothers.
And we could always get moustache cups marked his and hers.
Now, Lucy, you listen to me.
Now, I'm not going to stand here and I can't stand it.
You win.
Take it off and I'll shave.
Good!
Shave right now.
I got it all set up for you.
There you are.
All right, all right.
You've got more eyebrow pencil on there than you have whiskers.
Never mind the cracks.
Get it off, now.
You missed one right there.
What do you call this one- Charlie?
There!
Now you look like your old self again.
Welcome back, little lip.
Give me a great big kiss.
I'm not going to kiss you with that thing on.
Oh, I forgot.
Gee, this must have been put on with pretty strong stuff.
Here, let me try, honey.
Ow!
Gosh.
Boy, that's really stuck.
Are you sure you didn't grow this?
I better call Fred and find out how to get this off.
Hello?
Fred, this is Lucy.
Oh, hi, did the joke come off all right?
Yeah, the joke did, but the beard didn't.
Well, what do you mean?
Well, I've tugged and I've pulled and I can't get it off.
Well, that's funny.
It should come off easy.
I just used a little spirit gum.
Ricky, get me that bottle off the dresser, will you, dear?
All right, Hon.
Fred, y-you shouldn't have used such old stuff.
Maybe it changes with age.
How long have you had it?
Well, now, let's see, the last date I played was a split week in Peoria in 1925.
'25?
!
But spirit gum shouldn't change.
Oh.
Here, honey, I've got the bottle.
Thanks, dear.
I have the bottle right here, Fred.
It says "bull dog cement"!
Cement?
Yeah.
"Bull dog cement will not let go, holds fast forever.
"Can only be removed with bull dog cement remover number three.
" Oh, no.
Oh, yes!
Oh, shut up.
You certainly have a warped sense of humor.
I'm sorry, honey, I'll ca I'll call the I'll call the drug store and see if they got some of that stuff.
They won't have it in a drug store.
They have everything in a drug store.
Hello.
Listen, have you ever heard of some stuff called bull dog cement remover number three?
You have?
Oh, I see.
Well, thanks.
They don't make it anymore.
You mean you mean I'll have to keep this on forever?
Well, honey, I guess it'll wear off eventually.
Well, what happens in the meantime?
Well, honey I really should let you suffer but I don't have the heart to do it.
There's one simple solution and I'll do it for you.
What?
I'll get you job as the bearded lady in the circus.
Oh.
Lucy?
Lucy?
Where are you?
Lucy, I wanted to ask Oh, I beg your pardon.
I was looking for Good afternoon, ma'am.
Lucy?
Colonel Ricardo, at your beck and call, you all.
Lucy, what are you doing in those clothes?
Well, it's the only way I can get down to that little old drugstore without people laughing at little old me.
I thought maybe that little old druggist could do something for this little old face.
Well, how did you all do, Colonel?
Bad, powerful bad.
Oh, you poor little old thing.
Didn't he have any ideas?
Yeah, he said dye the beard red and the head would match all over.
Oh, what'll I do?
What's the matter?
When you chew with that beard on you look just like a billy goat.
Nobody but a nanny goat would notice it.
Well!
I've got it.
What?
Nah, you wouldn't go for it.
What is it?
Well Nah, you wouldn't like it.
Well, give me a chance.
What is it?
Well, we'll tie a string to your beard.
Yeah.
Then we'll tie the other end of the string to a flat iron.
Yeah?
Then I'll throw No!
Don't throw it.
Oh!
I knew you wouldn't like it.
Look out!
Scared me to death.
I think this is safer for little old me.
Lucy What?
You just gave me an idea.
What is it?
Well we'll set fire to your beard but I'll stand by with a hose to see that it doesn't get out of hand.
Ethel, this is my face.
You're not burning weeds off a vacant lot.
Who is it?
It's Fred.
What do you want?
If I bring good news, can I come in?
All right.
What is it?
I must have made a thousand phone calls before I located a drugstore that sells bull dog cement remover number three.
Oh, Fred, you doll.
Where is it?
It's in Chicago.
Chicago?
Yeah, but he's sending it Air Mail so it ought to be here tomorrow.
Oh Now, Lucy, that's not bad.
No.
Oh Chicago.
Hello.
Hello, is Monty Woolley there?
Did you call me up just to make gags?
No, this is important.
You know that talent scout I was talking to you about?
Yeah?
Well, I talked to him today and I talked him into coming to the house to spend an evening with us.
Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful.
Right in our own home.
When is he coming?
Tonight.
Oh, that oh, no, not tonight, Ricky.
Please, not tonight.
Well, honey, he's flying back to Hollywood tomorrow.
If I don't get him up to the house tonight I'll never get a chance to see him alone.
But, Ricky, what about me?
It's my one chance to get into the movies, too.
My beard, remember?
My beard!
Well, I'm sorry, honey, there's nothing I can do about it.
Oh.
We'll be home about 7:30.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Oh, Ricky's bringing that Hollywood talent scout to the house tonight.
He is?
No kidding?
Uh Lucy, would you mind if we dropped in?
No, of course not.
Well, we got to go.
Yeah, see you later!
Here we are, Mr. Murdoch.
Ah.
Let me take your coat.
Oh, thank you.
Make yourself at home, will you?
Fine.
Well, nice place you have here, Ricardo.
Thank you.
Sit down.
Thanks.
Boy, I'll be glad when that picture, Moon over Baghdad is finished with the casting.
Ah have a cigarette, won't you?
Oh, thank you.
You know, it's nice to spend an evening someplace else besides a hotel room or a theater.
Yes, well, that's what I thought.
That's why I asked you to come over here and get a night off from show business.
Ah, that's sounds good.
Oh!
I wonder how that got here.
What's that?
That's my old scrapbook.
My wife must have been doing some housecleaning.
I haven't seen this for years.
Well, let's see it.
Oh, no, no.
This is your night off.
I wouldn't want to bother you with this.
All right.

You certainly dance very well.

Maybe we could use you.
Oh, really?
Yeah, I imagine so.

My mouth is just below it and it has teeth and it goes sideways.
All the way.

Special delivery letter from Hollywood.
What does it say?
Well, wait a minute, wait a minute.

{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
No!
Really, Marge?
Well, confidentially, I've suspected that right along.
I have, I have.
You know what I've always thought about Betty and Jack.
Yeah, well, I've always said if there was ever anything in the world Lucy, Lucy, for goodness sakes, get off the phone.
Pardon me, Marge.
Did you say something.
Ricky?
Yes, I said, "Lucy, for goodness sakes, get off the phone.
" Oh.
Hello, Marge, bad connection.
Where were we?
Oh, yeah, Betty.
Yeah, uh-huh She didn't!
She didn't!
She couldn't!
Maybe that's why she didn't.
Oh, keep quiet.
No, not you, Marge.
Well, honey, I never would have thought that of Betty.
Oh, good-bye, Marge.
I'm surprised the phone hasn't grown to your ear.
Oh Lucy, why did you stop?
Don't tell me you got tired of taking Betty apart?
Who got tired?
Marge had to hang up.
Betty just walked in.
Gee, I wonder what they're saying about me.
Lucy, I want to speak to you about goss'ping.
"Gossping"?
Yes, I think that gossiping is vicious and petty and I think a gossip is the lowest form of human life.
Oh, so do I. You don't seem to get my message.
I was talking about you.
Me gossip?
What do you call what you were doing on the phone?
Well, it wasn't gossiping.
I prefer to think of it as a mutual exchange of vital information.
Ay Anyway, she was gossiping.
I was just listening.
Lucy, you remember the old saying "Birds of a feather smell the same"?
You mean, "A rose by any other name flocks together.
" Yeah.
Well, anyway, I was just listening.
It isn't gossip unless I tell it to someone else.
Well, that shouldn't take very long.
Are you implying that I can't keep my mouth shut?
Yeah.
Well, you'll find out.
Nobody's going to get this information from me.
My lips are sealed.
Uh, Fred and Ethel are coming up tonight.
I don't care, my lips are sealed.
This I got to see.
You will.
Let them in, I'll be right back.
All right.
Hi, Ricky.
Hi.
I'm sorry we're late.
I was fixing my hair.
Hey, Rick, is your phone out of order?
I've been trying to get you for an hour and a half.
Yeah, well, I know.
Lucy's been on the phone for an hour and a half talking to Marge.
Oh.
She's been getting all the details in some nice, juicy gossip.
Really?
Who was it?
When did it happen?
Who did what?
Oh, come on, Ethel, reel in your antenna.
Quiet.
Come on, Ricky, give out.
Uh-uh.
Well, Lucy will tell me.
I don't know about that.
She said she wouldn't say a word.
She said her lips are sealed.
Huh?
Oh, boy, I'll say they're sealed.
Hey, I kind of like that.
How come you never went in for one of those?
Oh, shut up.
Lucy, Ricky says you know a nice piece of juicy gossip.
Well, tell me.
Oh, darn it!
This is liable to be real good, Fred.
Would you care to join me in a ringside seat.
Thank you.
Oh, this is maddening.
Who's it about, Lucy?
Madge?
Uh Blanche?
Um Dorothy?
Um Luanne?
Uh, Betty?
It's about Betty?
Um Uh, Betty and who?
Betty and Fred?
No Betty and Ricky?
Oh!
Betty and her husband, Jack!
Oh, Betty and her husband Jack, yeah!
Um what happened?
They had a fight?
What did they what did they fight about?
A vase?
A woman?
Another woman?
Betty and her husband, Jack, had a fight about another woman?
Oh  Lucy, you promised you wasn't going to say anything to Ethel about it.
You're breaking your promise.
I don't care if you're not saying anything.
You're still gossiping.
Don't stop her now.
I haven't found out what happened.
How did Betty find out about Jack and the other woman?
Who are you?
A man?
Her husband, Jack!
Yeah, her husband, Jack and Betty.
No, no the other woman!
Jack and the other woman!
Were out dancing?
And drinking?
: And kissing?
Oh!
How'd Betty find out about it?
Now, they were dancing Yeah, Jack and the other woman are dancing and Betty came in the club and saw them!
So she separated them.
Ooh!
Oh!
Oh!
And Jack, Jack, yeah, yeah tried to get them to stop fighting, huh?
Yeah And they both beat up on him?
Oh!
Now they're all fighting all three of them are fighting and somebody came in.
Uh, the manager?
Uh, the bouncer?
Oh!
The doorman.
Uh, uh, uh a- a policeman!
A policeman.
He put the girls in the black Maria?
Oh!
Ooh, he threw in Jack!
Oh, what a juicy piece of gossip.
What a performance.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Thank you, thank you.
Isn't it amazing what women go through to tell each other some dirt?
Fantastic!
Listen, so we gossip a little- so do men.
Men gossip?
Yes, men gossip.
Well, now Now, wait a minute, Fred.
In all fairness, some men gossip a little.
Who does?
Well, uh, take Marco, my piano player, for instance.
It was only yesterday that I caught him talking to the drummer about Joe, the trombone player and what a wolf he is.
Joe, a wolf?
Is he?
I don't see how he can blow a note with those fangs of his.
No kidding?
Well, listen, this week is Nancy, the harpist.
Last week was one of the girls in the trio.
The week before that, it was the hat-check girl.
No!
Yeah.
Thank you, Hedda and Lolly.
Now, wait a minute.
The point is we can take it or leave it alone.
With you women, it's your life's blood.
Well, you two aren't exactly anemic.
I'll bet you that we can keep from gossiping longer than you men can.
Oh, that's a hot one!
Girls, you've made yourself a bet.
Okay, what's the bet?
Well, let's make it something interesting, now.
I know!
The losers will serve the winners breakfast in bed for a month.
How's that?
Okay, you've got yourself a deal.
All right!
Oh, hiya, Fred.
Oh, hi, Rick.
Wait a second, I'll walk home with you.
Ah, I'm glad I saw you.
Just coffee.
How are things in the gossip front?
Well, this is the third day, isn't it?
Yeah, I haven't heard a peep of gossip out of Lucy.
Not a peep out of my biddy either.
Thank you.
You know, I have a plan but I think it's a little sneaky.
Good, let's hear it.
Well, I thought maybe we could cook up some sensational hunk of gossip, see Uh-huh?
And then we tell it to our wives and leave them alone and wait for them to explode.
Well, there will be an explosion, all right except for one thing.
What's that?
If we tell them, then we'll be gossiping.
Oh, yeah, I didn't think of that.
It was a nice try, though- good try.
Listen.
Huh?
Supposing that, accidentally, we mumbled something in our sleep and our wives overheard it.
We couldn't be accused of gossiping then, could we?
Well, no but what with oh, you mean we-we pretend that we're talking in our sleep?
You got me.
Ricky, you're a Cuban genius.
Thank you.
Now, let's see who will we make up the story about?
Well, what about wait a minute, now.
What about the Foster woman, the blonde in 3-B?
They're both jealous of her looks anyway.
Yeah, Grace Foster.
Yeah.
That's good, that's good.
Grace Foster and who?
The milkman.
The milkman?
Yes.
That little, bitty guy?
Yeah.
He's so bashful.
That makes it all the juicier.
Grace Foster.
Grace Foster.
Grace Foster!
Huh?
What's the matter?
What's the matter, Ricky?
Oh, you must have had a nightmare.
Sleep well, little husband.
Grace Foster.
Grace Foster?
What about Grace Foster?
What are you dreaming about?
Why are you smiling like that?
What about Grace Foster?
Grace Foster is running away.
Grace Foster is running away with Don't stop now.
Go on.
Grace Foster is running away with the milkman.
The milkman?
Uh-huh.
Go on, go on.
Grace Foster y el lechero se van a salir juntos In English, in English!
Grace Foster is running away with the milkman and her husband doesn't suspect anything.
Go on.
That is all.
Ooh, Ethel will die when she hears this.
I can't keep it to myself another minute.
I'll call her right now.
Gee, it's pretty late.
I wonder what time it is.
Well, she might still be up.
I can't tell her without losing that bet.
It would be gossip.
Darn it!
That's right, sleep, you big ox.
What?
What?
What happened?
What?
What happened?
You must have been dreaming, dear.
Oh oh.
Good night, dear.
Good night.
I'm a real stinker, all right.
Ricky!
Ricky!
Hello, Fred.
How did it go last night?
Wonderful.
She swallowed the whole story.
How did it go with Ethel?
Well, if she'd have flapped her ears any more she would have taken off and circled the room.
Listen, we're a cinch to win the bet.
How do you know?
Well, Lucy just announced that she's going to go downstairs and borrow a cup of flour from Ethel.
Well, let's not waste any more time.
Where are we going?
We'll go down to the basement and listen through the furnace pipe.
Good idea.
Come on!
Ricky, I'm going downstairs now.
Ricky?
Oh.
Oh.
I just came up to borrow a cup of sugar.
I was just coming down to borrow a cup of flour.
Well, come on in, sit down.
Okay.
How about a cup of coffee?
Uh, no, thanks.
Um how have you been?
Oh, I've been fine, fine.
I feel wonderful.
How have you been?
Great, great, never felt better.
Well, let's drink to our good health.
What's new?
Um, uh Nothing.
What's new with you?
Nothing.
Dull, aren't we?
Yeah.
Well, I might as well go home.
How about your sugar?
Sugar?
Oh, never mind.
I really didn't need any flour either.
Well, so long.
Bye.
Drop up later, Ethel.
I got a pudding in the oven.
Pudding?
What kind?
Grace Foster I mean, brown betty!
You know then!
Yes, do you?
Yes!
Ricky, are you in there?
What did you hear?
I heard that Grace is getting ready to run away with the milkman!
They're going to Mexico and get a quick divorce and they're settling in Steubenville.
Steubenville?
!
Yeah, he's got a new milk route.
Well, if you ask me, I think her husband is well rid of her.
I think so too.
FRED : Ethel Mertz!
What's that?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Who's that?
This is your conscience.
You have been gossiping.
Ethel, you've got the loudest conscience I ever heard.
Lucy Ricardo!
This is your conscience.
You've been goss'ping, too.
Oh, fine, my conscience has an accent.
Ricky Ricardo, where are you?
Fred and I are down in the basement.
We listened to the whole thing through the furnace pipe.
Looks like you've lost the bet, girls.
Oh!
Keep them talking.
What are you doing down there now?
We knew you'd blab that phony Grace Foster story to each other.
Phony?
Yes, we dreamt it up and told it to you last night in our sleep.
There!
Maybe a little soot will teach them not to be so smart next time.
How do you like that?
They deliberately tricked us.
What a couple of fools we are.
Now we got to give those two bums breakfast in bed for a month.
What a revolting thought.
Wait a minute!
If they weren't asleep, they were awake.
Well, that's a monumental conclusion.
No, no, I mean if they were awake when they told us that story they were gossiping.
Yeah!
How about that?
Suddenly the breakfast is on the other foot.
Well, if it isn't the coal dust twins.
Very funny.
All right, girls, we won the bet fair and square.
Didn't we, Fred?
That we did.
Now, let's see tomorrow morning I would like some orange juice two eggs basted, ham, toast, jam and coffee.
I'll have the same, sweetie.
Well, that's just wonderful except for tomorrow morning, you'll be serving it to us.
She is so right.
FRED AND  What do you mean?
I mean you weren't really talking in your sleep so you were gossiping first!
Now, wait a minute, girls, wait a minute.
You have misconstrued the entire point of the situation.
Now, you see, if the story were true then we would have been gossiping but the story was not true- we made it up.
The whole thing was "friction" so we were not gossiping.
Now, you girls believed that the story was true so you were gossiping.
Now, that's the whole thing.
Oh, that is the silliest way of trying to crawl out of a bet What do you mean, "friction"?
Wait a minute!
Good morning, your majesty.
Good morning.
That's nice.
You're a very good wife.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Ricky, don't start till I get there!
Fred, what are you doing up here?
Well, I thought we ought to share our moment of triumph.
May I?
Be my guest.
Where are you, Ethel?
Coming, master.
This is the life, isn't it, Fred?
We're living like kings.
Why did you ever agree that they won the bet?
Well, Ethel, it would be different if that story about Grace Foster and the milkman was true, but it wasn't.
That's right.
Absolutely.
Help!
Help!
Save me!
Help!
What's this?
Who's that?
Save me!
He's after me, he's after me!
Who's after you?
Oh, all my milk will turn sour.
He's after me!
Who's after you?
Who's after you?
Who's that?
Mr. Foster, Mr. Foster!
Mr. Foster?
!
Where can I hide?
In there.
Oh MR.
All right, where is that?
Oh, help hide him, Lucy.
What's going on here?
MR.
Just watch me get my hands on that little shrimp!
That's all I want to do is find him!
What do you mean breaking in here?
What's going on here, Mr. Foster?
I'll teach that cow juice peddler to flirt with my wife.
Come on out, you cottage cheese Casanova!
What you doing there, you little shrimp  Mr. Foster, now, now nothing can be settled with a gun.
No?
You'll just go to jail.
Wow.
Now, you don't want to go to jail, do you?
No.
Now now, this is something that should be settled between you and your wife, Grace.
Yeah, I guess shooting him wouldn't solve anything.
It certainly wouldn't.
I suppose maybe I ought to give Grace a chance to explain.
That's right.
Yeah.
But let me tell you one thing.
From now on, we drink goat's milk.
So there's no truth to the story, hey, fellas?
Yeah, how about that, boys?
Oh, no, you don't.
I'll have honeydew melon filled with strawberries eggs Benedict and hot chocolate.
I'll have the same, Fatso.
Eso es lo que quiere comer para el desayuno- un pedazo de honeydew melon, Benedict eggs filled with strawberry y chocolate caliente  Oh, I forgot all about you.
You're safe now.
What a break he chose this apartment to hide in.
Would you hand me my purse there please?
Oh.
Thank you.
Now, here's five dollars for you and please give this five dollars to Mr. Foster and tell him I said, "thank you very much.
" You both gave wonderful performances.
Aw, think nothing of it, Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, with my compliments.
Oh, thank you.
It was a pleasure.
Any time.
Bye-bye.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Hi, Lucy.
Ho.
Hi, Ricky is in the living room, Fred.
Thank you.
Hi, girl.
Hi.
Did you tell Ricky yet?
Uh-huh.
Oh, I can hardly wait.
Imagine us being members of the Society Matrons League.
Mm, I don't see how you got up nerve enough to send in the application.
Why not?
It's just another club.
Just another club?
They're the cream of society.
Well, we'll fit in perfectly.
: "How do you do, Mrs. Mertz?
It's so good to see you, my dear.
" "How do you do"?
"Eh, how do you do"?
Oh, dear.
What's the matter?
Do you suppose when we're introduced to those society- type husbands they'll try to kiss our hands?
Well, if they kiss mine, they'll get dishpan lips.
Boy, I don't know how many dishes I've washed since we've been married.
I don't either.
Let's see- 20 dishes a meal, three meals a day three meals a day uh, four, five two, three, four.
We've been married for ten years.
No kidding?
How about that!
Come on, Mrs. Mertz.
Where are we going?
We're going to revolt.
We are going in there and demand that our husbands buy us electric dishwashers.
I'm with you.
Don't you ever throw anything but deuces?
Ricky?
Fred?
We're revolting.
No more than usual.
We didn't mean that.
Now, listen, Ricky, I just figured this out.
Since you and I have been married I have washed 219,000 dishes.
No!
You can imagine how many I've washed.
Yeah, must be up in the millions!
Lucy!
Well, I was just trying to make a point.
Oh.
Would you mind telling us what this is all leading up to?
Gladly.
There's a wonderful invention on the market that makes it impossible for about-to-be society matrons like us to get rough, red hands in dishwater and we think it would be a wonderful, wonderful investment.
Well, so do I. You do!
?
Certainly.
Hey!
They want us to buy them some rubber gloves.
I had reference to an automatic dishwasher.
Well, forget it, honey.
Why?
I can't afford it.
I can't even afford rubber gloves.
Oh, well, nice try, Lucy.
Oh!
Isn't it amazing how spoiled modern women are?
Spoiled?
Yes, spoiled.
You got to do a little work and you think it's terrible.
A little work!
Why, honey, this is the electric age.
All you have to do is flip a swish.
We flip a "swish.
" Listen, your grandmothers didn't have any of these modern electrical conveniences and they not only washed the dishes but they swept the floor, they churned the butter they baked the bread, they did the laundry and they made their own clothes.
Sure.
Where are those women today?
Dead.
You know what I mean.
I'd like to see you girls run the house without any of these modern conveniences.
Well, what about you guys?
Yeah.
You couldn't get along with them any better than we could.
Aw, honey, we're men, we're rugged.
Yeah!
They're rugged.
Why don't you put your money where your big mouth is.
Meaning what?
Meaning that we'll just try living without any modern conveniences and we'll see who yells "uncle" first- the men or the women.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, what do you want to bet?
How about $10?
What's the matter with $20?
Well, what's the matter with $30?
What's the matter with $50?
What was the matter with $10?
Okay, 50 bucks!
What are the rules?
Well I know.
We'll pick a year, like 1900 and we won't use anything that was invented after that.
Good.
1900.
Uh, did they use electric lights before then, Fred?
Don't look at me- ask Ethel.
Now, listen, you old Never mind, never mind.
Okay, tomorrow we all go back to the gay '90s.
Morning, Lucy.
Hi, Ethel.
What's all this?
I've been shopping in a junk store.
Say, those lamps are a good idea.
I was going to use candles.
How's Ricky?
Has he run into any snags yet?
Well, not really.
He got very upset when he found out he couldn't use his electric razor.
So did Fred.
And what a fuss he made.
I don't see anything so tough about shaving with a sharp-edged razor and cold water, do you?
No.
Fred just refused to shave at all.
No kidding.
What's that?
Oh, look at this.
A bathtub!
Lucy, you're not going to make Ricky take a bath in that?
Why not?
We want to win the bet, don't we?
Yeah.
Lucy!
Lucy!
Yeah, yeah?
Lucy, I want Oh.
Good morning, Ethel.
Hi.
Look at all this junk.
Is breakfast ready?
Well, I was just about to fix it, dear.
What'll you have?
Coffee, toast, a transfusion?
Never mind that.
Is breakfast ready?
I'll fix it for you right now.
Hey, you can't use the electric stove, you know.
Oh, yes, I can.
Lucy!
Lucy, you!
You can't light that.
This is the way my grandmother cooked.
This stove is not built that way.
It won't work.
It'll set the house on fire.
All right, do you want to eat cold food?
Well, I guess we'll have to compromise.
You can use the stove, but nothing else.
Thank you.
Where's my coffee?
Coming up, sire.
My grandmother was Swedish.
Howdy, neighbors.
Hi, Fred.
Hello, Fred.
I thought I'd find you up here, Ethel.
We are out of butter.
Oh, dear.
I'll run down to the store for some.
Ethel, if you're going out for butter will you get me a loaf of bread, please?
Sure.
Now, just a minute, my pretty maid.
My grandmother churned her own butter.
Yeah!
Churned?
Yeah.
That's right.
And my grandmother baked her own bread.
Baked?
Like I bake a cake?
I hope not.
Bake bread.
Churn butter.
Yeah.
Well, you'd like to call off the bet?
No!
No!
You churn a little extra butter for me and I'll bake a little extra bread for you.
Hi, Ethel, how's the butter churner?
Oh, I've been churning for two hours.
Well, you deserve a rest.
Put that thing down.
I can't!
Pry me loose, will ya?
My hands are beginning to grow to this thing.
Are you kidding?
I can't get them off.
Well, maybe you can pull it right out that way, huh?
Pull!
Well, relax now, relax.
I can't!
Pull!
: Oh!
You poor kid!
Oh, gosh!
How much butter did you make?
None.
You've been churning for two hours and you didn't make any butter?
Our grandmothers must have had arms like Gorgeous George.
How long does it take milk to turn into butter?
Ethel, you have to start with cream to make butter.
Anybody knows that.
My goodness!
Oh, cream!
Certainly.
Oh.
How you coming with the bread?
Well, it-it's very interesting.
You see, you mix everything together you put the yeast in, you mix it all up and you knead it, knead it.
This it what you call "kneading" it, see?
Yeah.
And then you let it set, and it rises, see?
And then you take it out, and you knead it again.
And you let it set, and it rises some more.
Then you put it in the oven, and you bake it.
Well, that sounds simple.
Sure.
I had to go to three, four stores before I could get enough yeast, though.
Why?
How much did you need?
That seems like an awful lot.
Well, here's the recipe right here.
Let me see.
Lucy.
What?
Three cakes.
Oh, really?
Oh, well, they're small.
It won't make much difference.
Well, now you have to put it in a bowl.
Mm-hmm.
There.
"Now set in warm place to rise.
" Yeah, and I'm going to put it right down here by the oven.
Okay.
Oh!
Now, let's get back to the butter department.
All right.
Gosh!
Ethel, help me.
Oh.
Can you lift it?
Gee, I must have hurt this some way.
What do you mean?
It's all swollen.
I told you that was too much yeast.
Well, I just won't have to bake again so soon.
Now I have to knead it again.
Yeah.
And then I have to let it set again.
Yeah.
There now.
Oh.
You want to get me a bigger bowl?
Here?
Yeah.
How's this, Lucy?
Okay ooh!
You think that's enough?
Yeah.
Oh!
Sorry, honey, I'm sorry.
There.
Now I let that set and that rises.
You better help me.
Yeah, I thought so.
There.
Back to the butter.
See, I told you that cream would do the trick.
Imagine- all that butter and it only cost me $23.75.
Ethel!
Oh, Lucy!
Oh, oh, my Ethel!
I've got it.
That's awful heavy.
Let me help.
Oh!
Oh, oh!
Oh!
Oh Get this out of here.
You want some help?
Ow!
Look, wait a minute.
Let me turn the bowl.
Oh!
I think this has grown to the bowl.
Here, put the bowl over there.
My goodness!
Well, it's a happy, little loaf, isn't it?
I have to knead this.
All right.
I'll hold the board.
Whoa!
Oh!
Ethel!
Ethel!
Whoa!
Hang on now!
Oh, Ethel, help me put it on the board!
Put it up on the board!
I'm sorry, Ethel.
Get that pan over there.
A pan?
Yeah.
How's this?
All right.
Oh, wait a minute there's a yeast bit there.
I got it, I got it.
Where?
There it is, over there.
All right, ready?
Ready.
Whoo!
Now I have to I have to shape it into a loaf.
Yeah?
Open the oven.
Oh, open the oven.
There.
You ready?
Come on, now, yeah.
Look out.
Oh!
Oh!
There.
Now, let's see.
The oven's all preheated like it says and in a couple of hours we'll have some nice homemade bread.
And butter.
Yeah.
What's so tough about this pioneering business?
Let's play canasta.
Okay.
Don't you look at my hand, now.
Oh, telegram.
Thank you.
Oh, Ethel, it's from the Society Matrons League!
We're in, we're in!
No kidding.
Look at this!
Let me see, let me see.
"You are invited to a tea "Friday afternoon at the Waldorf to be scrutinized " Scrutinized?
That's what it says.
"Before your final acceptance into the Society Matrons League.
" Yippee!
Oh, isn't that wonderful?
!
Oh, yes.
Now, we have to look real sharp on Friday.
We have to go to the beauty parlor and we have to get the works: a- a shampoo, a fingerwave, a manicure, a pedicure a permanent Oh, wait a minute, Lucy.
What?
If we go to a modern beauty parlor we'll lose that bet with the boys.
Oh, gosh.
Oh, it looks like it'll cost us Matrons.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
There must be some way.
I know, Ethel, our clothes.
What do you mean?
Well, if we if we were really living in 1900 we'd be wearing bustles and corsets and the fellows would be wearing high-button shoes and celluloid collars and those skimpy suits all the time.
You mean, on the street and down to work?
All the time and you know they'd never agree to that and we'd win the bet.
You're right.
Hey, do you smell bread?
Maybe it's done.
How did the oven door get open?
Ethel!
Ethel, help!
Oh, Ethel!
Ethel, I'm stuck!
Ethel, get me out!
Oh, Ethel!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Oh!
Watch out for my leg!
Watch out for my leg!
Ethel, watch out, it'll drop in my lap!
Hi, Ethel.
How do I look?
Oh, you look wonderful!
How do I look?
Like a doll like an old-fashioned doll.
Fred's in the bathtub.
I hid all of his clothes and left the old-fashioned ones.
Oh, good girl.
That's what I'm going to do to Ricky.
Gee, I hope this works, Lucy.
It will, but if it doesn't, I just had another thought.
What?
Well, you know I never mentioned transportation to Ricky so I'm going to watch out the window tonight and if he comes home in a cab, a bus or a subway we win the bet.
Ah, that's wonderful.
We're in.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Oh, no!
Ridi pagliaccio   Oh, don't be so happy.
Ah, honey, I love living in the turn of the century.
I love a hot bath, too.
Here are your clothes.
What, my clothes!
?
Those old-fashioned- looking things?
Yeah.
You thought it was fine that I was wearing them.
Now wait a minute, honey, it's different with you.
You stay in the house all day.
I got to go out on the street and be seen by people.
Sorry!
Now Lucy, you can't be serious about me wearing these clothes.
I got to go out on the street.
I got to Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
Lucy, look out, look out!
Hi, kiddo.
I am the chicken inspector.
And it's my day to crow.
With a little razzmatazz.
What's with him?
He likes those clothes.
What do I care what kind of clothes I wear just to fix the plumbing?
Besides, these remind me of the days when I was a gay, young blade.
While strolling through the park one day In the merry, merry month of may I was taken by surprise By a pair of roguish eyes While strolling through the park one day In may.
Very good, old man.
Thank you, sir.
You know, Lucy, you gave me a great idea.
I'm going to put a gay '90s number down at the club.
Now just a minute, Ricky.
You know you have to wear those clothes all the time not just down at the club.
I know, honey.
Be a wonderful advertisement for the show!
Oh!
Oh, fine.
Hey, Rick, doesn't Ethel look cute?
But what are you wearing that bustle for, honey?
You don't need it.
Pay no attention to him.
You leave it on.
I'm not wearing a bustle.
Eww!
Uh, is this the Ricardo residence?
Yes, I'm Mrs. Ricardo.
Good.
I'm Mrs. Pettibone.
This is Mrs. Pomerance.
We're the surprise investigating committee for the Society Matrons League.
Oh oh!
Uh, oh, won't you come in, please?
Oh!
Uh, oh, this is Mr. and Mrs I mean, Mr. and Mrs. Mertz.
Hiya!
Uh, and this is my husband, Mr. uh uh  Ricardo Ricardo.
Mr. Ricardo.
Won't you sit down, please?
Um we pop in like this unexpectedly so as to investigate how our prospective members really live.
Oh.
We want to make sure they're not bringing their best foot forward just for us.
Uh, do you dress like this normally?
Well, I Oh, it's not an every, uh Not as a Er, uh Oh, I see.
Uh, do you mind if we look around?
Uh, no, of course not.
Help yourselves.
Uh, where's the kitchen, please?
The kitchen?
Thank you.
What are we going to do?
I don't know, what can we do?
Ricky, Ricky, you can think of something, can't you?
Sure.
What?
You want to call off the bet?
No.
No!
All right, honey, all right.
I know how much this means to you.
I got an idea.
What?
I'll tell them that we're putting on an act together for our club and they caught us right in the middle of rehearsal.
Oh, honey, That's wonderful.
Thank you.
Quite interesting.
Quaint, to say the least.
Eh, ladies, eh, I know what you must think.
You do?
Uh, yes, you see, you chose the wrong time for your investigation.
I mean, that is to see the way that we really live.
You see, eh, we're putting an act together for my club and you caught us right in the middle of rehearsal.
You put on shows?
Yes.
Why?
Why not?
I mean, uh, do you do this for a living?
Oh, no, no.
We just developed a bad habit.
We like to eat.
Show people.
Uh, Matilda, we've been allowing show people to join for several seasons now.
Oh, yes, it happened three years ago when we needed money.
Um, well, we're willing to make allowances.
We'll look you over at the Friday afternoon tea, ladies.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Uh, just a minute, just a minute, just a minute.
What do you mean, "make allowances"?
What's wrong with show people?
Well, you must admit that most of them are a little, uh-uh My dear Mrs. Ricardo please don't misunderstand me.
The Society Matrons League as a body does not disapprove of show people as such.
Mm-hmm, well, perhaps we have something against the League.
When you get back to your blue-blooded sisters tell them that the Ricardo/Mertz investigating committee looked you over and we have no desire to join your phony baloney club!
Yeah, tell them that.
Go ahead, tell them that.
Well!
Well, I guess we'd better leave!
Good afternoon.
So long, kids.
Oh, Lucy, you were wonderful!
Ha, ha, baby, I love you!
You told those bats.
Yeah.
Oh, Lucy, you said all the things I was trying to think of and couldn't.
Ah, sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.
I'm going to give you the $50 and call off the bet.
Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful!
Listen, honey, I'm starved.
Let's go out to dinner, eh?
Good.
We got plenty of food right here.
Well, where?
Wha?
Right here.
Homemade bread with home-churned butter.
Dive in, everybody.
The last one in the middle is a rotten egg!
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Hi, Lucy.
I'm going down to the store.
Do you want What are you doing?
Cleaning out the desk.
Hasn't been done in a year.
Boy, what a mess.
They sure fill up with junk, don't they?
I'll say.
Is this the stuff you're throwing away?
No, that's the stuff I'm keeping.
What I'm throwing away is in the wastebasket.
You're sure getting rid of a lot.
Now, here's something no home should be without.
What is it?
I don't know.
Why don't you throw it away?
Well, I can't till I find out what it is.
Might be something I need.
I give up.
Don't you ever throw anything away?
Not very often, no.
Everything brings back some sort of a memory.
For instance, these are mementos from all our wedding anniversaries.
I keep something from each one.
Oh, Lucy, you're an incurable sentimentalist.
Yeah, I'm sticky over Ricky.
Here's our marriage license.
Aw.
This is the little piece of paper that changed my name to "Ricardo.
" "On this day, Lucille Esmeralda MacGillicuddy "was married to Ricky Bicardi"?
Bicardi?
Yeah, B-I-C-A-R-D-I.
I never noticed that before- must be a mistake in typing.
Well, it doesn't make any difference.
Well, I don't know.
You know how funny the laws are.
Gee.
Ethel, you don't suppose this license isn't legal, do you?
Oh, of course it's legal.
Don't be ridiculous, Lucy.
Hey, I never saw this picture of you two in a canoe before.
When was it taken?
Last summer, when Mr. Bicardi and I were at the lake.
Now, Lucy, you're not going to worry about that, are you?
No.
You are, too, aren't you?
Yes.
Well, it's just a simple clerical error.
Well, what if it matters?
Maybe for ten years Ricky and I would have been null and void.
Hi, honey, hi, Ethel.
Hi.
How's my little wife?
What's the matter with her?
She's off on another one.
Well, good luck, Mr. Bicardi.
What?
What's she talking about?
What happened, honey?
I was cleaning out the desk and I found this.
That's our marriage license.
Yeah.
Well, what's the matter?
Don't tell me it's expired.
Read it.
"On this day, Lucille Esmeralda MacGillicuddy was married to Ricky Ricardo.
" To Ricky who?
"Ricky Ric Bicardi"?
Oh, that's what she was talking about.
Well, honey, it's just a mistake.
I'll say it is!
We've never been married.
Never been married?
No.
Oh, now, sweetheart you're making a big thing out of nothing.
Nothing?
Suppose there is a Ricky Bicardi.
For all I know I might be married to a rum factory.
Now, honey, you're being completely ridiculous about this.
Well, I want you to call your lawyer and ask him if we're legally married.
Well, honey, my lawyer is out of town and besides, I'd feel silly I'm going to call the City Hall.
I'm going to get ahold of the License Bureau and I'm going to find out.
Give me the City Hall, please.
Well, this is an emergency.
Thank you.
Hello, City Hall?
There's a mistake on my license and I want to talk to someone about it.
What do you mean, "Call the tail waggers"?
It's it's not a dog license, it's a marriage license.
Oh.
Hello, Marriage Bureau?
There's a mistake on my license and I want to know if it makes any difference.
Oh.
All right, I'll be right down.
They say they have to see it.
Oh, honey, you're not going to go all the way down to the City Hall, are you?
Now, honey, I just can't rest until I find out.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Ay, esta mujer esta completamente loca.
Casada por diez anos y todos los anos se pone peor y peor y peor de la cabeza, esa muchacha.
Hi, Rick.
Oh, hi, Fred.
Oh, sorry, I didn't know you were having a nap.
That's all right.
I got to get dressed anyway.
Ethel just told me about the mistake in your marriage license.
Isn't that silly?
Yeah, I just got ours out and took a look at it.
Some darn fool spelled my name right.
Well, it wouldn't make any difference anyway, Fred.
I know.
I thought I could worm out on a technicality.
Lucy was so worried that she went all the way down to the License Bureau to find out how we stand.
I wish I'd have known that.
I got a good friend down there.
I'd have called him for her.
They won't tell her on the phone anyway.
Oh.
I wonder what'd happen if this guy tells her that the license is no good.
: Oh, no.
Hey, how well do you know this guy?
Well, he's a pretty good friend of mine.
Why?
He is, eh?
Yeah.
I was just thinking suppose you call this guy down there just for a gag, you know, and tell him that when Lucy gets down there to tell her that the license is no good and that we're not married at all.
Do you think he'll do it?
Oh, I know he'll do it.
Any word from Lucy yet?
No.
It's 9:00.
The License Bureau closed at 5:30.
Where can she possibly be?
I don't know.
Oh, it's all my fault.
Oh, there she is now.
Honey, I've been so worried about you Don't.
What's the matter?
I'm no longer yours to touch.
Well, now, Lucy, now, look, hon Did you see the man at the License Bureau?
Yes.
We've been revoked.
No!
I didn't know what to do so I've just been walking.
You've been walking all this time?
Well, the last hour I was on a train coming home.
On a train?
Where did you walk to?
East Orange, New Jersey.
How I ever got through the Holland Tunnel, I don't know.
Hey, you really took that news seriously.
Well, how do you think you'd feel if you suddenly found out you weren't married to Ethel?
Yeah!
Now, look, honey, look, sweetie I got something to tell you, honey.
Oh, I know what you're going to say, dear.
No, honey, you don't, and this is very important so don't stop me.
Now, look I know what you're going to say, baby- that you still love me and that it doesn't make any difference to you whether we're legally married or not.
Oh, Ricky, it's so wonderful of you.
That's what you were going to say, wasn't it, dear?
Yeah.
Yeah, honey, yeah.
Well, I thought it all over and there's only one thing for us to do.
What's that, honey?
Get married again right away.
Married again?
Of course!
Oh, isn't this exciting!
And I don't want anything to spoil my memories of our first marriage- the one that didn't take.
So we're going to do the whole thing over again exactly as we did before, starting with the proposal.
You mean we got to go all the way up to Connecticut?
You mean you don't want to?
Oh, yeah, honey, sure, I want to.
Yeah, baby, I'd like to do it.
Okay.
Okay, we'll start the first thing in the morning.
We'll find that same little bench and you'll propose in the same way and we'll be married by the same justice of the peace and we'll stay overnight at the Byram River Beagle Club and-and we'll do everything just the way we did before.
Honey, it's 125 miles to the Beagle Byram River Club and I got a rehearsal the next morning.
Well, we'll get back in plenty of time.
Come on, Ethel.
Good night, Ricky.
Lucy, where are you going?
Pardon me.
My dear Mr. Ricardo surely you don't expect me to stay here.
You're a bachelor, remember?
Lucy, now wait a minute.
Lucy!
You got to have a friend down at the License Bureau.
Well, I know it's around in here someplace, Ricky.
It's got to be, because I know Oh, here it is!
Here it is, the same little bench.
I told you it was in here.
Come on, Ricky!
Coming, coming.
Well, the least you could do is help me with this stuff.
Why do you make me carry everything?
Before we were married you insisted on carrying everything, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, honey!
Gee, I don't remember this seat being so small, do you?
I guess the trees grew in a little from each side.
Let's face it.
We've grown out a little from each side.
Gee, doesn't just being here make you feel romantic, Ricky?
Yeah.
Let's eat, huh?
The last time you were here you said, "Who needs food?
I want to feast on your beauty.
" Oh.
Who needs food?
I want to feast on your beauty.
You bring any mustard?
Somehow, it sounds different than it did then.
Honey, what you want to start with- chicken salad or peanut butter?
I want to start with a proposal.
Before we eat?
Now, Ricky, down on your knee.
Oh, honey, the ground is all wet.
Down on your knee.
Now, I want everything just the way it was before.
All right, honey, all right.
Okay.
Down on my knees.
You know, I even took your wallet out of your pocket and left it home.
My wallet?
Why?
What did you do that for?
Don't you remember?
That day you left your wallet at home and I had to pay for the license.
Oh, yeah.
Well, go ahead with the proposal.
Uh You took my hand Oh.
Uh um Lucy, I love you madly.
Lucy, I can't live without you.
Why did you take my wallet?
Now I don't have my driver's license!
I know- I know I don't deserve a wonderful girl like you.
I know I don't deserve Take my hand.
Oh.
I know I don't deserve a wonderful girl like you.
Lucy, will you marry me?
Lucy, will you marry me?
What's the matter?
Well, this is a pretty important step in my life.
I don't want to be rushed into anything.
What?
!
It's a good thing to know where I stand.
Honey, I was just kidding you.
Come on, sit down.
No!
Come on, sit down, I'll propose, honey.
Come on.
Never mind.
Oh, come on, honey.
Let me do it right.
Sit down, I'll propose.
No.
It's a pretty big step for me, too and I don't want to be rushed into anything.
Well, honey, can't you can't you take a joke?
What's funny about your not wanting to marry me?
Oh, honey, I do want to marry you.
I do You do not.
You do not.
The real truth slips out.
Oh, now, Lucy, baby.
Don't "Lucy baby" me!
From now on, I'm Miss MacGillicuddy to you.
and for your information I wouldn't marry you if you were Xavier Cugat!
Lucy!
Honey, look!
Xavier Cugat?
!
Lucy!
"The Eagle Hotel.
" I don't know why you couldn't remember to put gas in the car.
Even if I had remembered, I couldn't have paid for it.
You took my wallet.
That's no excuse.
No excuse.
Isn't there anybody alive in this town?
What town?
Fire!
Fire!
Start the engines pumping!
Where's the ladder?
Get the hose!
Where's the fire?
There is no fire.
Well, I heard the bell.
I saw the flames.
Oh must have been your hair.
Well, sir what can I do for you?
I'm Burt Willoughby, Fire Chief of this here fair city.
Well, look, Mr. Willoughby you know that gasoline station across the street?
There's nobody there.
You know who runs it?
Oh, you're looking for the man that runs the gas station.
Yes, sir.
Fill 'er up?
Oh, you run the gas station, too, eh?
Well, we're out of gas.
Too bad, so am I. What?
Yep, won't get any till 6:00 tomorrow morning.
Oh well, I guess we'll just have to spend the night here.
Yep.
Sign the register.
"Mister and Missus "Ricky "Ri Ri Ricardo.
" Pardon me, please.
"Miss Lucille MacGillicuddy.
" Good girl.
You cad!
That'll be two rooms- Oh, what's the difference?
Two floors- that's the difference.
I'll send a boy out for your luggage.
Oh, well, this is all the luggage that we have.
Oh, well, in that case it'll be $4.00 in advance.
Each, that is.
You took my wallet.
I don't have any money.
That's too bad.
Would you show me to my room, please?
What do you mean, "That's too bad"?
Give the man the money, will you?
Why should I pay for your room?
We're not married.
Yeah, why should she?
Now, look, honey, let me explain.
Let me explain the whole thing to you, will you, please?
The whole thing is a gag, honey.
Now I'll tell you what happened.
Look You know, Fred Mertz had a friend.
He had a friend down at the License Bureau, see?
So I asked him to tell his friend to tell you when you got down there that the license was no good and that we were not married at all.
That's what I told him and he did it, you know?
Isn't that funny?
That's the phoniest story I've ever heard.
That's the phoniest story I have ever heard and I've heard them all.
Now, Lucy, for goodness' sake Uh-uh.
Please, stop annoying our paying guest.
I'll have a bell boy take you right up to your room, young lady.
Thank you.
Front!
Oh, are you the bell boy, too?
Why, sure.
Call for Philip Gosh, I've heard that a thousand times but I just can't remember what that fellow's last name is.
Follow me.
What happened?
What?
What?
Good morning.
Well, she's all filled with gasoline and raring to go.
Good.
Let's get out of here.
Gee, we're just in time to go to New York in time for rehearsal.
Let's go.
Just a minute.
That gasoline came to $3.25.
Well?
Well, give him the money.
You certainly don't expect me to pay for the gas, do you?
Well, you better give the man the money or neither one of us is going to get back in town.
Well, it doesn't matter to me.
I have no pressing engagements.
But, honey, I have I'm the sheriff.
I just had a call from the gas station.
Which one of you is the deadbeat?
He's your man, Officer.
All righty.
Well, I guess you're going to jail.
Jail?
!
Yep.
Wait a minute.
Un momento, caballero.
Me deje explicar.
Estamos casado hace diez anos.
Ella esta completamente loca.
Me quiere poner en la carcel.
Aha!
A spy!
A spy?
!
Just a minute.
Just a minute, Mr. Willoughby.
Uh, he isn't a spy.
Well, you don't kid me.
I know Russian when I hear it.
Well, that wasn't Russian, that was Spanish.
Spanish?
Well, we licked them in '98 and by golly, we can do it again.
Come on.
Look, you better give this character his money or he's going to have me shot.
Why should I care what happens to you when you don't care enough about me to marry me?
Yeah.
Say, why don't you marry that little lady?
Well, I would marry her but she wouldn't marry me.
No?
No.
Anyway, I don't even have money to pay the justice of the peace.
Well, maybe if you talk right nice like the justice of the peace might do it for nothing.
Yeah?
Well, you know where I can find him?
Where's the happy couple?
You know, the real money in this town is selling hats.
Look, Mr. Willoughby, can we rush this thing?
I'm in a terrible hurry to get back into town.
Young man, this is serious business.
You just can't rush into marriage, you know.
Now, let's see we need a witness.
Mother!
Yes?
That's Mrs. Willoughby.
I call her "Mother.
" Look, can we get started now, please?
I'm in a terrible rush.
Look, I'm not going to marry you until you propose.
In front of Mr. Willoughby?
Oh, go on, please.
Go ahead, Ricky.
All right.
Lucy Down on your knee.
Lucy, will you Oh, wait!
Wait just a minute.
I want Mother to see this.
Mother!
Hurry up, please.
Goodness!
Well, don't hurry me.
I want you to hear this.
This young gentleman here is just about to pop the question to the lady.
Oh All right, Ricky, start popping.
Lucy Lucy, I Lucy, I think you're the most wonderful girl in the world.
I can't live without you.
Lucy, will you marry me?
Yes, I will.
How sweet!
All right.
Now, can we get going now, please?
All righty.
Now, Mother, take your place.
Now, you two just get right No, you're on the other side.
Mother, please!
Well, I don't know where For all the times you've done this For goodness' sake, now, stand still, will you?
All right.
Oh, I just had a terrible thought.
We can't get married.
We don't have a license.
Oh, don't worry about that.
I know.
You're the head of the License Bureau.
Oh, no, I'm not, smarty.
I am.
Mrs. Willoughby would you make the license out right away?
And I'll be right back.
Lucy, where are you going?
You'll see.
I want everything to be just the way it was before.
Come on, honey, aren't you ready yet?
Come on, Lucy.
Lucy, you look so beautiful.
Will you marry me?
Yes.
Well, I guess we're all set.
You're on the wrong side.
Oh.
We have a beautiful ceremony, we do.
We start with a song.
Hit it, Mother.
I I love you truly, truly, dear Life with its sorrows, life with its tear Fades into dreams when I feel you are near For I love you truly, truly, dear Thank you, Mrs. Willoughby.
Very nice, very nice.
Ah, love, 'tis something to feel your kind hand Ah, yes, 'tis something Mother.
Beside you to stand Mother.
Gone are the dreams Mother!
That's all, Mother.
Don't I even get to sing the second verse?
No.
Oh, nuts!
There's your certificate.
Now you're all legally married.
Thank you, Mrs. Willoughby.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Wait, wait, wait!
I forgot something.
Whee!
Oh!
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Not so fast.
Do you own that car parked out there at the curb?
You know I do- you just filled it up with gas a couple of hours ago.
Do you realize that you've parked 12 hours in a one-hour zone?
Ten dollars or ten days.
But we just gave you all the money we had to pay for the gas.
Ten dollars or ten days.
Just a minute, Burt.
You young folks just run right along and forget what he said.
Mother, please!
Are you forgetting you're talking to the sheriff?
Father, you're forgetting I'm the mayor.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Hi, Lucy, I came up to give you some  What was that?
It was on the ceiling.
I'm trying to learn to flip pancakes up in the air like they do in restaurants.
Oh.
I came up to give you this money.
Boy, am I glad to get it off my hands.
What is all that?
What are you trying to do- bribe me?
The club treasurer asked me to give it to you.
Oh, for the bazaar.
Yeah.
You're supposed to use it to rent the hall and buy the refreshments have the posters printed Shh!
What's the matter?
I don't want Ricky to hear.
Lucy haven't you told him you're chairman of the bazaar?
No, and I'm not going to tell him till next Friday.
But the bazaar's next Thursday.
Exactly.
You sure live dangerously, Lucy.
Well, after what happened at the Fourth of July carnival last year Ricky made me promise that I wouldn't get mixed up in any more club affairs.
I don't blame him.
You weren't very bright throwing all those skyrockets and Roman candles in a fireplace.
Well, who uses a fireplace in July?
He should have looked before he threw that match in there.
Poor Ricky.
His eyebrows didn't grow in for a month.
You remember those little baby toupees he wore over each eye?
Say, where are you hiding all the stuff that's been donated to the bazaar auction?
I'll show you.
What a treasure trove!
Shh!
Say, when we sell that the club will have nothing but money.
And I've got a slew of stuff to collect.
I'm going out as soon as Ricky leaves.
Lucy!
Yeah, dear?
Ready yet?
Okay, yeah.
I got to run along.
So long.
Bye-bye.
Hey!
Not a word to Ricky.
Don't worry.
Okay.
Good morning, honey.
Good morning, dear.
Hey!
Tortillas.
Yeah.
I made them out of Aunt Jemima tortilla mix.
Oh, I keep forgetting here in America you call them flapcakes.
Come again?
Hot jacks?
You were closer with tortillas.
They are hot cakes.
Oh.
Not these.
These are cold cakes.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I'll make you some hot ones.
No, honey, it'll take too long.
I'll just have some coffee.
I'm in a hurry.
Well, I'll make some for myself.
Listen, you got any money?
I haven't got any money for cab fare.
I don't know.
There's my bag over there on the shelf.
Thanks.
Oh, honey, I just remembered- no, I don't have any money.
I don't have a cent in there, honey.
Give me my bag.
Wait a wait I don't have a cent.
Wait a minute.
What are you getting so excited about?
Let's see what's in here.
Wow.
What is this?
Uh it's my mad money.
Yeah, I get awful mad.
Lucy.
Where did you get this money?
Uh I saved it out of my allowance?
No?
No.
Uh No.
Ew Now, Lucy, this is no joke.
There's a lot of money here.
I want to know where you got it.
Ricky, you said you were late for work.
Now, Lucy, I want to know where you got that money.
Did you earn it?
Did you borrow it?
Did you steal it?
Yeah, that's it.
Which one?
Oh, it doesn't matter- any one of them.
Now, Lucy.
All right.
You'll find out sooner or later anyway.
I stole it.
What?
Well, I'm sorry- I saw it and I just couldn't help myself.
Now, Lucy, you're not telling me the truth.
Yes, I am.
Word of honor?
Well what good's a crook's word of honor?
Look, I haven't got time for jokes right now but by the time that I come home this afternoon you better have an explanation of how you got that money, understand?
Yes, sir.
All right.
I'll take the subway.
Lucy?
Lucy?
Ricky?
Lucy?
Yeah?
Oh, there you are.
How did everything go today?
Oh, just wonderful.
I got some wonderful stuff.
That's great.
But listen, Ethel Ricky found that bazaar money in my bag this morning.
He did?
How did you explain it?
Oh, I didn't.
I tried to gag my way out by saying I stole it.
Stole it?
!
Yeah, well, he didn't believe me.
Listen, Ethel, can I tell him that it belongs to you?
Huh?
Can I tell him the money is yours?
Well, if you'll do me a favor.
What?
Do you think you could auction off that hideous cuckoo clock that Fred won at Coney Island?
Well, sure, but Fred would never donate that.
But I've got a scheme.
I bought a little clock to donate and I'm going to tell you to go downstairs and get it.
It's on a table next to the cuckoo clock and you take the cuckoo clock by mistake, see?
After it's auctioned off what can he do about it?
Ethel, how could ever think up a sneaky scheme like that?
Who do you think you are- me?
I'll do it.
Fred?
Yeah.
Where are you?
Right here.
I'm trying to fix the leg on this darn couch.
It keeps coming off all the time.
You want to give me a hand?
Listen, Fred, I got an awful problem on my hands.
You should have thought of that before you married her.
Look, this is no joke.
This morning I found a roll of bills in Lucy's purse- $200.
And just now I saw her sneaking in the house carrying some big silver things- real expensive-looking stuff.
Well, there must be some explanation.
I don't think so.
She hid them in the closet.
You know, there must be thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that closet that doesn't belong to us.
Gee whiz, you don't suppose she's a kleptomaniac?
Oh, no, I just think she steals things.
Yeah, that's what a kleptomaniac is- a person who steal things and can't help it.
It's a kind of a disease.
Oh, gee.
Oh, you must be mistaken.
Come on, help me with this, will you?
Okay.
My God.
Fred, are you home?
Fred?
Oh, Fred.
You see!
If I hadn't see it with my own eyes I'd never believe it.
How do you like that?
She is a klep klep klep what you said.
Oh, this is terrible.
I'm married to a thief.
Now, listen, Rick, if she is a kleptomaniac it isn't her fault.
She doesn't know what she's doing.
She's just a poor, sick person and we shouldn't blame her for hey, that dirty crook stole my clock!
What am I going to do?
Well, I don't know about you but I'm going to get my cuckoo clock.
Come on, let's sneak up the back way.
Okay.
Come on.
Hi, fellas.
Hi, Lucy.
What's new?
Nothing.
If you'll excuse me I got to go in the bedroom.
Lucy?
Lucy, I want to talk to you about something, honey.
Won't you sit down?
Oh, I'd rather not.
I Don't you don't you have anything to tell me?
No.
Aren't you hiding something under your coat?
No, no, that's all me.
Too much pie and cake lately, I guess.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
What was that?
Yeah.
Oh, I did it.
Uh Cuckoo, cuckoo.
I'm learning to do bird calls.
It didn't sound like you.
Well, it was.
I'm Cuckoo.
I'm I do  several kinds of bird calls.
Uh Cuckoo Bird calls?
Yeah.
What was that?
That was a South African Yellow-Bellied Sapsucker.
Cuckoo.
Cuckoo.
Do you know any more bird calls?
Um  What was that?
A hummingbird.
Cuckoo.
You do that cuckoo a lot, don't you?
Well, that's my best one.
Cuckoo.
Um I do the English sparrow.
Cuckoo.
Cuckoo.
It's part sparrow and part cuckoo.
I know someone who's all cuckoo.
I'll see you later, fellas.
I want my cuckoo clock.
Wait, Fred, please.
You'll get your cuckoo clock back later.
The most important thing right now is Lucy.
Now, come on.
Let's go down to your place.
What are you going to do?
There's only one thing to do.
I'm going to call a "pysaciatrist.
" What?
A "pysaciatrist.
" I'm going to call a head doctor.
I think you should.
Come on, will you?
Lucy?
What?
The most awful thing happened.
Fred and Ricky saw you take the cuckoo clock.
They couldn't have.
There was nobody there.
Yes, there was.
They were behind the sofa fixing something.
Oh, so that's why they were asking me all those questions.
And that's not all.
Ricky was hiding in the kitchen and saw you putting all that stuff in the closet.
Oh, and that money this morning.
What must he think?
He thinks you're a kleptomaniac.
What?
A kleptomaniac.
He came down to our apartment and called a psychiatrist.
I heard him.
He told him all about it.
He's bringing him home with him tonight.
Oh, he is, is he?
A fine, trusting husband to have.
Well, I'll show him.
Now, wait a minute, Lucy.
After all Ricky actually saw you taking things.
Sure I've been taking things but he thinks I've been taking things.
Oh.
Why don't you tell him about the bazaar?
What, and admit that I'm a liar?
Oh, no.
If he wants a wife who's a thief I'll give him a wife who's a thief.
Lucy, what are you hatching?
When Ricky and that psychiatrist come home tonight we are going to be playing a little play starring Lucy the Lip and Babyface Ethel.
Oh, no.
You're not going to get me in on this.
Listen to me, Babyface.
Now, you help me pull this job or I'll squeal that you were the brains in the cuckoo clock caper.
Okay, you got me.
What's the deal?
Come in, doctor.
Oh, remember, Ricky, not doctor.
Oh, that's right Tom.
Lucy, where are you?
Oh, give me your coat.
Oh, thank you.
Sit down, won't you?
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Lucy?
I wonder where she could be.
Well, I Hi, Rick, you seen Ethel?
No.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you had company.
Oh, that's all right.
This is a very good friend of mine Dr. Robinson, the "pysaciatrist.
" This our landlord, Mr. Mertz.
How do you do, Mr. Mertz?
How are you, doctor?
Very well, thank you.
Listen, don't call him doctor in front of Lucy.
We want her to think that he's just a friend.
Oh.
Have you seen Lucy?
She's probably with Ethel.
Maybe they're out shopping.
Yeah or shoplifting.
Well, I hope they'll be home soon.
Would you like a cigarette, doc?
Oh, yes, thank you.
Well, this is the first time I ever smoked one of these.
Gee.
Fred, look at all these jewels.
Sticky fingers strikes again.
Wait a minute- what's the matter with this chair?
Look at this.
A blowtorch.
A crowball a crowbar.
Flash.
This is terrible.
Let me see what this is.
What is it?
Oh, no.
It's the floor plan of the Chase National Bank.
The 72nd street branch.
Why, that's where I keep my money.
This is serious.
Oh, I hope I'm not too late to help her.
What's going Okay.

Mrs. Ricardo Yeah.
Look me straight in the eye.
Yeah?
Mrs. Ricardo, you don't hate anyone.
You're at peace with all the world.
You love everybody.
Yeah?
Yes.
And you're tired.
You're feeling very tired, aren't you?
Yeah.
And you're getting very drowsy.
Yeah.
You feel so very sleepy and calm and peaceful.
Yeah.
Relax.
That's a good girl.
Right down there.
Um oh, uh let's put little "Tommy" to bed, shall we?
Now, Mrs. Ricardo why don't you tell me how you got started in this life of crime?
Go back.
Go back into your childhood.
Go back.
Back.
: Well, it all started when I was a little girl.
I was riding on the streetcar one day and I looked up and I saw a box and it said, "take one.
" So I took one.
There was nothing wrong with that.
Oh, yes, there was.
From then on, I took anything that came into my pretty head even though it didn't say, "take one.
" I took a bright, new penny.
I took a bicycle.
I took a little boy.
You took a little boy?
Yeah.
But my mother made me give him back.
And then then you grew up.
Yeah.
: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, and I began picking pockets.
I picked a peck of pockets.
Pretty soon I graduated to purse snatching.
Would you like to see my collection?
Well, uh I don't believe I have time.
Where's my watch?
Right here, sonny.
Come on, dead end.
Okay, brains.
Oh, Ricky, this is much more serious than I realized.
Oh, do you think there's any hope?
Do you think you can do something?
I don't know.
Hey!
That's a lot of purses!
I got purses here I ain't never opened yet.
Get a load of this loot, sonny.
Get a load of that, will you?
Boy, I been snatching purses for nigh unto 12 years.
Whoa, boy!
I grabbed this one quicker than I thought.
I remember now- snatched this off a dummy in a store window.
Mrs. Ricardo.
Yeah?
I'm not just a friend of your husband's.
No?
No, I'm a doctor, a psychiatrist.
Now, if you'll undergo treatment with me I think I can cure you of all this.
Well I think I'm cured completely.
I don't think I'll ever steal anything as long as I live.
Oh, why?
Well, what is there left?
This morning I achieved my highest desire- a kleptomaniac's dream.
What do you mean, Mrs. Ricardo?
Well, I sandpapered my fingertips put on my big coat with the big, secret pocket went down to Clyde Beatty's circus.
Down to Clyde Beatty's circus What could she possibly get at the Clyde Beatty circus?
Oh!

My entire Cuban reputation depends on how I handle myself this afternoon.
Oh, you'll do fine.
Who are these people?
Well, they're members of a dance group that Ricky worked with in Cuba, and he's booked them into the club to start off their American tour.
Gee, that's exciting.

Aw So, they were telling me, you know, that her partner hasn't arrived in New York, and they want me to dance with her tomorrow night at the opening.
Well, honey, I think you should.
Go ahead.
Well I'd love to see you and little Renita dance.

Yeah.
You've done pretty well yourself.
Thank you.
Oye, Renita.
Estamos esperando aqui Ricky, I think you're right, dear, about not doing that dance.

Now, let's go.
Wait just a minute.
How did your meeting with Ricky's friends go?
We've got two more apartments to make.
I said let's go.
Oh, now, Fred, I'm sorry you're in such a hurry.
I kinda wanted to ask your advice about a sexy Cuban girl that was here last night.
Come on.
Sexy Cuban gal?
What about the sexy Cuban gal?
Push your eyes back in your head, fatso.
Come on, tell me, what happened?
Well, it seems that when this girl, Renita, was a child she and Ricky used to dance together.
She was much younger than he was.
Yeah, what happened?
Well somehow she caught up with him.
So?
So now her partner hasn't arrived and they want Ricky to dance with her tonight.
So?
So so you haven't seen Renita.
I'd just like to get a load of that dance they're doing, that's all.
Then why don't you go to rehearsal.
Oh, I can't do that.
I'm not going down there and have Ricky think that I'm jealous and spying on him.
Well, I could go watch and then report to you.
Oh, no you couldn't.
I could go.
No, that's no good.
Well, you know in the afternoon down at that club, there's always a couple of those scrubwomen hanging around.
Scrubwomen?
Scrubwomen.
All right, hold it, hold it, hold it.
Listen, in that part of the brass, let's bite them off a little more.
Let's go: Dah di da da da Ta ta da da All right?
Now, let's hear it.
Just the brass.

Everybody's a comic.
All right, come on, you know what I mean.
From the top, eh?

Ojala que sea de Ramon.
Yeah.
Oh, it is, it's from Ramon.
He's in New York.
He's going to be here this afternoon.
Oh, good, now you can do the number with him.
Oh, no, Ricky.
Oh, yes, honey.
I'm not as good a shape as I used to be.
Besides, I'd like to see you do that native wedding dance you told me about, huh?
All right, I'll get the music.
It's in my dressing room.
Honey, I'll get it.
: You get it.
No cracks from you characters.
Uh, would you care for some cookies, Renita, dear?
No, gracias.
It's been lovely visiting with you, though, Lucy, and I must really hurry down to the club.
I have to get ready for the opening, you know.
Oh.
Well, Renita, it's been just wonderful getting to know you.
Lucy oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you had company.
That's all right, Ethel.
Renita, this is Ethel Mertz.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Well, you don't mind if I go freshen up a bit, do you?
Oh, no, not a bit.
Right in through there, dear.
Right in through the bedroom.
Thank you.
Yes.
Oh, isn't she cute.
Lucy, I don't trust you being so palsy- walsy with her.
What are you planning to do?
Oh, you're so smart.
Listen, I'm going to do that "Lady In Red" number with Ricky tonight if it's the last thing I do.
Wait till you see the beautiful costume I have.
Oh, now, Lucy, this is just silly.
Why don't you let her do the dance with him.
You don't even know the steps.
Listen, a rumba's a rumba.
You just wiggle your hips and jump up and down.
What about her?
I have plans.
Good-bye, Lucy.
Oh, darling, I'll call you a cab.
Pardon me, Ethel.
No, no, that's all right.
I will take the subway.
No, no, no, I wouldn't hear of it.
Nonsense.
Now sit down.
I'll call a cab.
?
Como esta?
Oh!
iUsted tambien habla espanol!
Lucy no me dijo que ella habla espanol porque toda la gente hablaba espanol y ella no estaba diciendo nada.
Oui.
Hello.
Hello, I'd like you to send a cab to 623 East 68th Street.
Right away, please.
Apartment 4A.
Yes, thank you.
The cab will be right over.
Thank you.
Did you call a cab, lady?
Well, yes, I did.
I'd have been here sooner only, but, uh, traffic was agin' me.
Good-bye, Mrs. Mertz.
Now, Cabbie, I want you to take very good care of this little lady.
I want you to take her to the Tropicana Club.
Don't you worry, lady.
I know a short cut through Piladelpia.
Adios, Lucy.
Adios.
Good-bye, lady.
Adios.
Lucy Bueno, muy bueno.
Magnifico, isn't that right?
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Carlos and Maria, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm indeed very happy that you like those wonderful people because they were the ones that gave me my start in show business.
And now for the highlight of the evening, I'd like to introduce to you Ramon and Renita doing their version of the African wedding dance.
So now we take you to  Africa.
Just me.
I only want to get you into the mood.
You know, on the night of the full Moon, the high priest goes to a jungle clearing and sings a song of love and then follows the courtship dance in which the bridegroom tries to impress his bride-to-be with his fierceness and strength.
So now let's pretend that this is a jungle clearing, there is a full Moon, and the high priest is singing his song.
Spirit in the wood, beat the hollow cane Spirit in the wood, float away the pain Make their bodies ripe and alive again I sing me-lo Spirit in the heart, make the blood flow fast Spirit in the heart, make the muscle last Keep the hope alive while their youth will pass I sing me-lo When the woman come upon the scene Drop a petal from a tree Veil the mountain up into the skies Spill the river in the sea.
Spirit in the wood Let the hollow cane echo in the afterglow Waiting for the flame to burn again I sing me-lo I sing me-lo I sing me-lo I sing me-lo I Sing me-lo.
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
Here you are, dear.
Oh, thank you, honey.
Hey, what goes here?
Just two eggs?
Where's the bacon?
Bacon happens to be 75 cents a pound.
Look, Lucy, I can't eat eggs that way.
They-they-they look absolutely naked.
Well, look the other way when you eat them.
Now, Lucy, where's the bacon?
As far as I'm concerned, it's still on the hog.
I'm economizing.
Well, look, honey, that's a very good attitude, but why do you have to cut down on food?
There's just no other place to cut down.
Is that so, eh?
What about all the money that you spend on clothes and the beauty parlor, hmm?
Why don't you cut them out?
Well, all right, if you think you'd like your meals served by an ugly brunette wearing a flour sack.
You know what I mean.
This must be some other way to economize.
Well, as a matter of fact there is, Ricky.
Look, "Save money with a home freezer.
Get your meat wholesale.
" I knew it!
I knew it had to be something in back of all this.
But it won't cost us a cent, Ricky.
Look, it says right here: "This freezer pays for itself.
" Oh, well, let me see.
Hey, maybe we ought to get one.
Really?
Sure.
As soon as it gets through paying for itself, tell it to give us a call and come over.
Now, you know what I meant.
Honey, I can't afford a freezer, not even one that pays for itself.
But Ricky, listen, it's only going to save us money I cannot do it, honey, no.
Can't afford it.
See you later.
What about your eggs?
Oh, I got a feeling that they won't go to waste.
Ethel is coming up, isn't she?
Good-bye.
Good morning, Lucy.
Oh, yeah?
Good-bye, Lucy.
Come back, Ethel.
If I'd wanted to be with somebody grumpy I'd have stayed downstairs with Fred.
What's the matter with you?
Oh, I asked Ricky if we couldn't have this freezer, and he says he can't afford it.
Can't afford it.
I asked Fred to buy us a freezer, too.
What did he say?
I'll tell you what I said.
Please, please, there are ladies present.
I just come up to tell you not to expect any heat today.
I put all new firebrick in that furnace and we can't use it till the cement dries.
This house might be a home freezer itself by night.
Charm boy.
Yeah.
Gee, why is it everything that's wonderful costs money?
I don't know.
Say, why didn't I think of this before?
Uncle Oscar!
Uncle Oscar?
My Uncle Oscar is a butcher, and he's got a big cold chest.
Why don't you knit him a sweater?
Well, of course, if you don't want to hear my plan I do, I do.
Well, he's retiring from the meat business, and he's got a great big old freezer- you know, the kind you walk into and hang up the meat.
I'll bet he'd sell us that for practically nothing.
Really?
I'm going to call him up.
If we could buy it and put it in the basement, we'd have a real home freezer.
How much do you think he'd sell it for?
I don't know, but there's no harm in asking him, 'cause this would be a great way Hello, Uncle Oscar?
This is little Ethel.
Little?
Uncle Oscar, how much do you want for that big old freezer of yours?
For me.
Well, that sounds like a fair price.
How much?
He'll sell it to us for nothing.
For nothing!
All we have to do is pay for the hauling and installation?
How much is that?
$50.
Sold!
We'll take it!
When can we have it installed?
This afternoon?
Oh, gee, that's fine.
Kiss Aunt Emmy for me, will you?
Good-bye, unc.
Lucy, we now own a home freezer.
Thank you.
Let's get busy!
Look out!
What are you doing?
Ordering meat.
The sooner we get the meat in the freezer, the quicker we'll be saving money.
I wonder how much we ought to order?
Oh, 20, 25 Pounds, maybe 30.
Gee, that sounds like a lot of meat.
Honey!
It'll last!
Hello?
Hello, this is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo at 623 East 68th Street.
I'd like to order some meat for our freezer.
Beef.
Oh, I see.
Just a minute.
It's only 69 cents a pound!
No kidding?
Why, steak's $1.89.
I know, I'd better order right away before he realizes what a bargain he's giving us.
Uh, all right, that'll be fine.
Oh, by the side?
Oh, well, just a minute.
That's the price by the side.
How big is a side of beef?
Well, a side of bacon is about this big.
Oh, well, that's okay.
All right, I'll take a side.
Better make it two sides.
One for each of us.
Yeah, can you send it over this afternoon?
East 68th Street.
That's right, thank you.
In the meantime, we'll go downtown.
What for?
Well, with all that money we're saving on the freezer, we can afford to buy ourselves new dresses.
Hurry up!
Get ready!
Oh, yeah, it was a lot of money, but after all, it's a very basic style.
I can wear it for years.
Oh, I can hardly wait to try these things on!
I'm going right down to my apartment and put this on.
Oh!
Say, maybe that's the meat.
Yes, sir?
Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes, sir?
Johnson's Meat Company.
Gee, that sure is a lot, isn't it?
Oh, there's more.
Oh?
Look at the way they wrap it.
Yeah.
My goodness.
Oh, hey, are you sure that's all for us?
Lady, this is only the beginning.
Oh, there must be a mistake.
Oh, that isn't a side of beef.
That must be a side of elephant.
Lucy, what have we got ourselves into?
Well, what's all this going to cost, Ethel?
We're getting 700 pounds of meat!
At 69 cents a pound, that's $483.
Listen, there's been a mistake.
You're going to have to take most of this meat back.
All but 30 pounds.
Yeah.
Sorry, ladies, once a side of beef has been cut, we're not allowed to bring it back.
Come on, Ethel, let's get busy.
What are we going to do?
I'm going to paste this animal back together again.
Find the piece that fits that.
Look, ladies, even if you defrosted it, pasted it together and taught it to walk, I couldn't take it back!
Well, that's one side.
Now let's go down and get the other one.
The other one!
Ricky and Fred are going to kill us!
Yes, but by buying it all wholesale we saved them at least $500.
I hope you can explain all that before their fingers tighten around our throats.
Maybe we could sell some of it!
Sell it?
Yeah, you know, we could go to a butcher shop and grab some of the customers before the butcher gets to them.
We could sell this for 79 cents a pound.
But it only cost 69.
Well, we might as well make a little something on it.
Oh, no, Lucy, we couldn't sell it.
It wouldn't be right.
It wouldn't be fair.
Why not?
It's Well, don't just stand there!
We got a lot of meat to sell!
Get ready for business.
Psst!
Psst!
Come here.
Are you tired of paying high prices?
Are you interested in a little high-class beef?
Do you want a bargain?
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
Step up a little closer I don't want to block the traffic.
Now, you look like a smart dame.
What'll it be?
I got sirloin, tenderloin T- bone, rump, pot roast, chuck roast, oxtail stump.
I got a special on T-bone, 79 cents a pound.
Well, really, I'm Shh!
Quiet.
Get 'em while they last, lady.
Step right over and help yourself.
Ethel, help the little lady, will you?
What'll you have?
Well, I'd like a sirloin.
A sirloin coming up.
Keep it down, keep it down, kid.
How much does this weigh?
Weigh.
Three pounds.
I'll take it.
Psst!
Come here.
Are you interested in some high-class beef?
Are you tired of paying high prices?
Do you want a bargain?
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
Is this choice meat?
Absolutely- give the little lady her choice, Ethel.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
That's not what I meant.
Get away from me, kid, you bother me.
Tell you what I'm gonna do: any cut you want, 79 cents a pound.
But how can you afford to sell it so cheap?
I'm glad you asked that, lady.
This is all made possible because we do everything ourselves.
We rope, we brand, we butcher, we market.
We do everything but eat it for you.
Well, I'll try a round steak.
Okay, step right over here.
A round steak.
Keep it down.
Hey, hey Rock-a-bye baby In the treetop Rock-a-bye baby in the treetop Step right up.
Every Ohh!
Amscray, amscray!
Utcherbay.
Watch the papers for our new location!
Good afternoon.
This is the last.
Oh, thank goodness.
Boy, 700 pounds of meat is a lot to carry.
Oh!
You know you know, what worries me is how we're Oh!
Honey, I'm sor Wait till I get the key.
Gee, I'm sorry!
Oh, boy, it gets cold in there in a hurry!
Yeah, how about that.
You know, this is dangerous not being able to open that from the inside.
We'd better have this lock taken off tomorrow.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Golly.
Well, Lucy, we did it.
It's all in there.
Yeah now we just got to explain all this meat to Ricky and Fred.
Yeah.
You don't suppose they'd believe that a cow wandered in there and fell apart?
Nope.
No, I guess not.
What's that?
It's Ricky and Fred.
They're coming down here!
Oh, no, they're up in the apartment.
We're hearing them through the furnace.
Are you sure?
Sure, I'll show you.
Don't touch that, honey, it's hot!
No, Fred's fixing it, remember?
Oh.
I wonder what Ricky's doing home already.
I'll see.
Lucy, they're looking for us!
What are we gonna tell them?
Well, come on, we can't let them find us down here.
Hurry up!
Well, Ethel, look who's here!
Why, it's Ricky and Fred!
Yeah.
Girls, we want to talk to you.
About what?
I ran into Uncle Oscar today.
Start packing, Ethel.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
We're not mad at you.
We think it's a wonderful idea that you got the freezer.
Yeah, that was a real smart business deal.
Yeah, how about that?
In fact, we think you did so well getting the freezer that we want to do our share, too.
That's right, and just to get you started, here's what we got.
Gee, swell.
Gee.
You ever saw that much meat in your whole life?
No.
Boy, that sure is a lot, isn't it, Ethel?
Well, come on, let's get it down to the freezer.
Yeah, let's put it in the freezer, come on.
No, no, wait a minute.
I have a couple of steaks.
I think we ought to do it all in one trip.
Come here and help me, Ethel.
What's with her?
Listen, you stall them while I get that meat out of the freezer.
How can I stall them?
Listen, if I can move 700 pounds of meat you ought to be able to keep two husbands occupied for a couple of minutes.
Well, what can I do?
Dance with them, talk, sing.
That's it, ask Ricky to sing.
Sing?
You know he won't.
Oh, won't he?
Listen, you take care of the ham.
I'll take care of the beef.
Hi, fellas.
Hi.
What's the delay?
Delay?
Where's Lucy?
Come on.
Lucy?
Um, uh uh, she, uh she, uh The freezer was dirty and she wanted to go down and clean it all up before you saw it.
Oh, honey, what's the difference?
Come on, we want to see it.
Let's go down there.
Come on, let's go down.
No, wait a minute, Fred.
You know Lucy, if she uh if, uh Ricky, I think you sing better than anybody in the whole world.
Would you sing for me?
Sing?
Now?
Yeah, now.
What's the matter with you?
Are you losing your mind?
Come on, we've got a freezer down there and a lot of meat to put in it.
Now let's go right now.
Wait, wait a minute, Fred.
Wait a minute.
If Ethel wants to hear me sing that bad, I gee, I wouldn't want to deprive her of the pleasure of it.
Oh, no.
Well, you'd like to hear me sing, eh?
All right.
You really think I sing good, huh?
Gee, that's very nice of you.
What would you like to hear?
Anything with a lot of choruses.
Oh, boy, a lot of choruses, eh?
All right.
Here's one.
Ay mama, ay nene Ay mama, ay nene Aw, Ricky!

What would you like to hear, Ethel?
Anything.
All right, here's one you should like.

Well, how's our little quick-frozen redhead?
Okay, Fred.
Good.
Hey!
What smells so good?
It certainly makes me hungry, whatever it is.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Smells delicious.
Yeah.

Unplug me!
What's the matter with you?

{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
Hi, honey.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Darning your socks.
Well, good for you.
I didn't know you knew how to darn.
Oh, sure, there's nothing to it, especially if you have a darning egg.
Boy, you should have seen the hole in this one.
It's taken me half an hour to sew it up.
Hmm.
There.
Darn it, I sewed up the top.
Oh, Lucy, you're amazing.
Oh, well, I'll just have to rip it out.
No, no, don't do that.
Why?
I can use it as a blackjack.
Oh, give me that.
No, I've got to fix it.
Oh, dear.
Honey, where are you going?
I'm going to rehearsal, honey.
Again?
You've been to rehearsal every day for a week.
I know, but I can't help it.
Wouldn't it be easier to get good musicians?
Please, no disparaging remarks.
I'll get it, I'll get it.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Jerry.
Well, my goodness, Jerry, there must be millions of girls who want to take this job.
Oh, look, Jerry, don't I have enough trouble putting the whole television show together without having to look for a girl to do the commercial?
Uh uh Cuantas veces ha dicho que no me llame a la casa?
Never mind, never mind.
I know what you're talking about.
What about a television show, Ricky?
Wait a minute.
All right, Jerry.
I'll get the girl to do the commercial.
Good-bye.
Well?
Well, I'm going to do a television show.
That's all.
And you cannot be on it.
Oh, Ricky, please?
Just let me do the commercial.
Nothing doing.
Why not?
Look, honey, this is too big a chance for me.
I need someone with a lot of 'sperience.
Well, I've had "'sperience.
" You never even been on a television show.
Well, maybe not, but I've watched them a lot.
There's a slight difference.
Oh, now, Ricky I'm sorry, honey- I got to go now.
I'll see you later.
Oh!
Hi, Lucy.
Hi.
Need any work done up here?
Ethel's gone to see her mother for a couple of days and I got a lot of time.
Ethel's gone and you want to work?
Yeah, it seems loafing isn't any fun unless she's nagging at me to get some work done.
Well, there's nothing to do up here unless you want a job knocking some sense into Ricky's head.
What's the matter?
Well, he's going to emcee a big television show and they need a girl to do the commercial.
Now you know how good I am at that.
Oh, sure, I've seen you do a hundred television commercials.
Well, I would be good if somebody would ever give me a chance.
Now, why don't you just relax and forget the whole thing?
Gee, if there was only some way Ricky could see me on television.
Well, now, maybe you'd qualify as a lady wrestler.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
I got it!
I know what I'm going to do.
What?
Well, listen, when Ricky comes home tonight I'm not going to be here, but you are.
Oh, I am, huh?
Yeah, and you're going to turn on that television set, and you know who's going to be on it?
Well, I can only hope it's Faye Emerson.
No, no, it's going to be me.
Well, how are you going to work that out?
Never mind, you just turn on that set and leave the rest to me, okay, buster?
Oh, hello, Fred.
Oh, hi, Rick.
Where's Lucy?
I don't know.
I came up to watch your television.
Ours is on the blink.
Oh?
And there's a wonderful show coming on just about now.
At 23 minutes after 4:00?
Yeah, now, sit down there.
I want you to watch it.
You'll enjoy it.
Call for Philip Morris!
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Look, look, Rick, that's Lucy.
She's on television.
Yeah, how about that?
I can't get over how clear the picture is.
Yeah.
Da-da ta-da-da-da!
Well, what do you know?
Third-dimensional television.
Yeah.
Shh.
Da-da ta-da-da-da!
Philip Morris, America's most enjoyable cigarette, presents the Lucy Ricardo Show.
Da-da ta-da-da-da!
I don't think this is such a hot show, Fred.
I think I'll get another station.
As our first offering this evening, we Stop that now!
Go back and sit down!
That's very funny.
Now, come on out of there.
As our first offering this evening, we present Lucy, I said come on out of there.
As our first offering this evening, we present that inimitable personality that talented performer that versatile entertainer Lucy Ricardo!
Ricky!
Ricky!
What are you trying to do?
!
Are you crazy or something?
What are you trying to do, barbecue me?
I'm sorry.
Are you really sorry?
Of course I'm really sorry.
Are you truly sorry?
Yeah.
Well, are you sorry enough to let me do the commercial?
No.
Oh, why not?
Look, honey, even if I wanted to give you the job, I couldn't.
I already hired another girl.
Oh Say, what did you do with all the works?
I took them out.
Well, I can see that, but where is it?
It?
Yeah.
The chassis slides right out.
All in one piece?
Yeah, all in one piece.
Eww What do you mean, "eww"?
Well Lucy, what have you done?
Well, I didn't know it all came out together.
So?
So, I took it out one piece at a time.
Oh, no!
Lucy, I've got to be at a television rehearsal in half an hour.
Is my breakfast ready?
Are you still not speaking to me?
Look I don't care if you don't want to talk to me or not, but please get up and fix my breakfast.
I need my strength.
Lucy, are you going to fix my breakfast or not?
What do you want me to do, starve to death?
Would you, please?
Look, I had a perfect right to bawl you out.
Putting that television set together is going to cost a fortune, maybe more.
I'm glad it's broken.
Glad?
Yes, now I won't have to look at your silly Cuban mug on that show tonight.
Ay, que barbaridad.
No se lo que le paso a esta mujer.
Cada vez, cada semana se pone peor y peor la cabeza.
Yo me voy a ir de aqui.
Esta completamente equivocada de todo.
No se lo que le paso.
Hello.
Oh, Fred, could you come up for a minute, please?
Senora Ricardo and I are not speaking to each other and I'd like you to do me a favor.
Thank you, Fred.
Hi, Rick, what do you want?
Oh, listen, Fred, I got to go to rehearsal right away and I'm expecting a very important phone call and Lucy's mad at me.
So would you please stay here and give someone a message?
Sure.
Well, the girl that is gonna do the television commercial is going to call.
Now you tell her to be at Studio 10, Television Center, at 1:00 this afternoon.
All right.
Thanks a lot, Fred.
You're welcome.
See you later.
Oh, hello, Fred.
What are you doing here?
Oh, hi, Ricky asked me to wait here and take a telephone message.
He told me that you two aren't speaking to each other.
Oh, well I'll take the call, Fred.
It's silly to have you wait up here.
All right, it's from the girl who's doing the commercials on Ricky's television show tonight, and he wants her to be sure and get the message.
Now, you won't mind this, Lucy?
Oh, no, not at all.
Television center, Studio 10, 1:00.
Yeah.
Hey, how did you know that?
Oh, well, that's where Ricky does all of his television shows.
Oh.
Well, I'll see you later.
Okay.
Bye.
Hello.
Oh, no, Mr. Ricardo isn't here.
Oh, yes, yes, he wanted me to give you a message.
He said to tell you that he's very sorry but they've already hired another girl to do the commercial and they won't be needing you after all.
Good-bye.
Deedly deedly dee, deedly deedly dee Okay, Joe, I'm ready to rehearse the commercial.
Where's the girl?
She's studying her script.

Now, Lucy, I told you you couldn't do the commercial.
Now, what's the big idea?
Lucy, what have you got to say for yourself?
Hello, friends, I'm your Vitameatavegamin girl.
Are you tired, run down, listless?
Never mind, never mind.
Do you poop out at parties?
Never mind that.
Now, come on, you're going home.
Now, wait a minute, Ricky, it's too late to get anybody else.
Besides, she's pretty good.
Oh, sure, sure.
No, I mean it, listen to her.
You go ahead, Miss MacGillicuddy.
Yeah, go ahead, Miss MacGillicuddy.

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Your Saturday Night Varieties.
My name is Ricky Ricardo, I'm your host for this evening.
We have some wonderful acts, and I think we're all going to have a lot of fun.
So, if we may, we'd like to start things off with a little music.
Mr. Hatch, if you please?

{END OF EPISODE 30}{START OF EPISODE 31}
Oh, boy, how can two people manage to use so many dishes?
What'll we do tonight, Ricky?
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
Let's call the Mertzes and play some cards.
I don't feel like seeing the Mertzes and I don't want to play cards.
What do you call what you're doing here?
Tiddledywinks.
Play your black tiddledy on your red wink.
Look, this game is supposed to be played by one person, hence the name solitaire.
"Hence thee name solee-taire.
" You don't want to see the Mertzes, you don't want to play cards.
I'll get you a gun, you can shoot yourself.
Thank you.
What's the matter tonight, honey?
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I guess I'm just discouraged about my career.
Your career?
Why?
Well, I don't seem to be getting anyplace.
I'm not exciting anymore.
You are to me.
I mean I'm not news.
Can't get my name in the paper.
Nobody's talking about me.
Oh, they are, too.
I hear people talking about you all the time all over the place.
Yeah, name one.
Well, uh just the other morning the milkman asked me how your cold was.
That's what I mean.
The milkman wants to know how my cold is.
Big deal.
Well, what about your publicity agent?
That's a good question.
I should give that 50 bucks a week to someone who can get my name in the paper.
Gee, would you give that job to anybody who's bright and energetic and has wonderful ideas about publicity?
Who?
Well, would you?
Well, who is it?
If I don't get your name in the paper, it won't cost you a cent.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, please, please don't!
Now, look, don't look, look, just forget the whole thing, will you, please?
Now, just-just-just put publicity out of your mind altogether.
Oh, come, now.
Oh, my goodness.
What a horrible thought.
It isn't that bad.
Look, you want to help me really?
Sure.
All right, just-just forget publicity altogether.
All right.
Don't even tell people that you know me.
All right!
All right.
Okay.
All right.
All right already.
Good morning, Lucy.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Figuring out the value of my jewelry.
Insurance?
No, publicity.
Ricky's worried because he hasn't been getting enough publicity so I'm going to help him.
You know how those Hollywood stars get their name in the paper when their jewels are stolen.
Hey, that's a wonderful idea.
Yeah.
I can see the headline now.
So can I. "Ricky Ricardo's wife robbed of priceless jewels valued at " Some headline.
Yeah.
Hey, how about letting Ricky win a title like Miss America?
He doesn't have the right measurements.
Oh, that's not what I meant.
No, we need something like this.
Look.
"The Shah of Persia has a standing order for all of Benny Goodman's records.
" Well, you can do exactly the same thing.
How?
Have Ricky order all of Benny Goodman's records.
Oh, Ethel!
This item is good only because it concerns royalty from a faraway country.
That's what makes it exciting.
Oh.
If we just knew a countess or a princess who couldn't live without "Babalu.
" You don't know any royalty, do you?
My aunt was queen-for-a-day once.
Well, we'll just have to dream someone up.
Let's see, now we'll tell the papers that an exotic princess is coming from a faraway country, traveling halfway around the world just to hear Ricky Ricardo in person.
Hey, that's sensational!
Yeah, now what country will she be from?
Well, it can't be too well known.
No.
I know- Franistan.
Yeah Franistan?
I never heard of it.
Neither did I. Princess Scheherazade daughter of the Maharajah of Franistan.
Oh, if she was the daughter of a maharajah, they wouldn't call her a princess.
What would they call her?
A maharani.
Oh, no, Ethel, that's a maharajah's wife.
Oh.
I guess she'd be a "maharincess.
" "Maharincess.
" Yeah.
Scheherazade, Maharincess of Franistan.
Gee, that's wonderful.
Yeah.
Too bad she can't really come to town.
Yeah.
Of course, that's impossible.
Yeah?
Lucy!
Just call me Scheherazade.
You wouldn't dare!
I would, too.
Will you help me?
I'm yours to command, my maharincess.
The papers will eat this up.
Come on, we got a lot of work to do.
Now, you look up the phone numbers of all the newspapers in town.
All right.
I got the number of the Post here.
And we have to make a reservation at a fancy hotel.
How about staying at the Waldorf?
Swell.
Hello.
Hello, city editor, please.
This is the overseas operator.
Hello, editor?
We have an overseas call from Franistan.
It's a maharani-to-person call.
Go ahead, Franistan.
: Hello, hello, hello?
Hello, this is the maharani of Franistan.
Please do not print in paper about my daughter, Scheherazade.
The Maharincess, she come to America.
Yes, she come to America and Maharajah very mad she come to America just to see famous singer in person.
He is famous band leader.
Ricky Ricardo.
Ricky Ricardo!
: Ricky Ricardo!
R- i-c-k-y R : Yeah, that's right, Ricky Ricardo.
Yes.
Now, promise promise you print nothing in paper and you do not try to contact her at Waldorf Astoria Hotel.
Waldorf Astoria Hotel!
Yeah, good-bye.
Good-bye.
: How'd I sound?
Great.
Give me the next number.
Well, do you know when he'll be in?
All right, look, as soon as he gets there would you please tell him to call me?
This is Ricky Ricardo.
I'm down at the club.
All right, good-bye.
Hi, Rick.
Hiya, Fred.
Did you see the paper?
Yeah, I saw the paper.
Congratulations, old boy.
Look at the size of this type.
"Franistan royalty makes pilgrimage to see Cuban idol.
" I know, I know.
"Maharajah's daughter claims Ricky Ricardo is real gone.
" I've read it, Fred, I read it.
Yeah, yeah, well, I'd kind of think you'd be a little bit more excited.
Not every band leader can make a maharincess flip her beanie.
You don't mean to tell me you really believe that story, do you?
Well, it's in all the papers.
Are you out of your head or something?
A member of royalty in some ridiculous place called "Crafistan" or whatever the name of the joint is- she gets ahold of one of my records, so she travels halfway around the world just to hear me sing.
Well, that's the phoniest story I've ever heard in my life.
Then where did it come from?
My press agent, where else?
I told that character I wanted some publicity, but this is ridiculous.
I'll be laughed right out of the business.
Well, now that I think it over, it does sound pretty silly.
Of course it's silly.
Only an idiot will believe a story like that.
Hello.
Kenny.
Now, look, what is the matter with you, Kenny?
Are you trying to get me kicked out of show business?
You know what I'm talking about- the story in the paper, the story.
Look, that is the most ridiculous, the most stupid the silliest, phoniest What?
You didn't?
Now, wait a minute, Clem.
You're not kidding me, are you?
Well, I'm going to call the Waldorf right away and find out.
You did call the Waldorf.
And the Maharincess of Franistan registered there this morning?
Holy cow.
Huh how about that?
Okay.
Talk to you later, kid.
I guess it's true.
Somebody around here just said only an idiot would fall for a story like that.
Now, wait a minute, Fred.
Now, let's look at it this way- here's this poor girl sitting in her castle in faraway Franistan, she gets ahold of one of my records, she finds my voice irresistible and she falls madly in love.
There's nothing farfetched about that.
Maybe I ought to go out and come in again.
Gee, I wonder if she speaks English.
You know what they speak in Franistan?
I don't know, where is it?
Where is it?
Yeah.
Oh, Fred, don't you know anything?
No, where is it?
Franistan?
Yeah.
Well, it's right between Czechoslovakia and Below the border of Austria.
Well, you know, it's stuck right in between Switzerland and Persia- right in there someplace.
Oh, there!
Yeah, there- Franistan.
That's where it is, right there.
How about that?
Gee, I wonder what you do when you're introduced to royalty?
How about this, Fred- Your Highness, I am delighted to meet you.
: Oh, Mr. Ricardo, you send me!
Now, you're sure that Her Highness said she'd be here at 3:00?
Yes, her lady-in-waiting called me right after they checked into the Waldorf, and she said she'd be here at 3:00.
Hey, Ricky hold it.
Thanks.
Are you going to put on a whole show just for her?
Yes, yes, it's a command performance, you know.
We're going to do everything.
Hey, Rick, I just called the house again.
Lucy and Ethel must be out shopping.
Oh, gee, that's too bad they have to miss it.
Yeah.
Uh, fellows Now, please don't forget how we rehearsed her entrance now.
All right?
We tuned up?
Okay.
Cigarette?
Yeah, please, thank you.
I guess you must be pretty nervous at meeting royalty like this, huh?
Mm?
Nervous?
No, why should I be nervous about meeting royalty?
I don't have to be Hey, Rick, look.
Here they come.
All right, fellows, up, everybody up.
: The Maharincess of Franistan.
Your Highness.
Welcome to the Tropicana.
Your Highness.
Uh Your Highness Um Your Highness, uh did you have a nice trip over?
: Yes.

Yes.
Would Her Highness answer a few questions for the press?
Yes.
Good.
Your highness, is it true that Ricky  Uh-uh-uh.
Oh.
Your Highness, is it true that Ricky Ricardo is your favorite vocalist?
Yes.
Do you like any other American performers?
No.
Now, let me see if I have this straight- you've never seen Ricky Ricardo in person, you first heard his records two years ago and you fell in love with his voice and decided to come to America to see him.
Your father didn't approve, but you came anyway and you can hardly wait to hear him sing.
Is that right?
Yes, no, yes, yes, yes, no and yes.
I see.
Now, about the political situation in Franistan- do you Please!
No more questions.
The Maharincess want you to sing.
Oh, well I'm deeply honored.
When we are dancing And you're dangerously near me I get ideas  Hold it, hold it.
What's wrong, please?
You sing, she swoon.
Please go on.
Well, if my singing makes her faint, maybe I'd better not.
Please, I like it.
When we are dancing And you're dangerously near me I get ideas I want to hold you So much closer than I dare to  I want to scold you But I care more than I fear to And when you touch me I perspire in every finger  I get ideas And after we have kissed good night and still you linger I kind of think you get ideas, too.
Though your eyes are always saying The things you're never saying I only hope they're saying That you could love me, too.
For that's the whole idea, it's true The lovely idea That I've fallen in love With You.
Oh.
Encore, encore.
Thank you.
Really, would you like some more?
Really.
Oh, I see, uh uh, Your Highness, I understand that your favorite number of ours is "Babalu.
" Oh!
"Babalu" "Babalu"!
Babalu Well, Lucy, we'd better get out of here.
We've got to check out of this hotel and get home in time for dinner.
Oh, but I'm so tired after that performance at the club all afternoon.
It was worth it.
Think of all the publicity Ricky's going to get.
Yeah, but why did he have to sing so many songs?
"Babalu.
" If I'd had to faint one more time, I'd have fainted.
Well, let's get out of here.
Okay.
Listen, if that's another reporter, don't let him in.
Yes?
Where is Her Highness?
Hey, wait a minute.
What do you want here?
I want to Your highness, you are in terrible danger.
Things are not going good in Franistan.
Franistan?
Oh, wait a minute, now, who are you?
Chief of Franistanian secret police, Amjan Xanadu.
Well, I'm Lucy Ricardo.
You do not have to conceal your identity from me.
You bear the mark that is borne only by women of royal Franistan family- red and black hair.
Look, this is just a wig, see?
Please believe me, you are in great danger.
The revolutionists are after you.
Hey, he's serious.
Good heavens, Ethel.
Do you really think there is such a place as Franistan?
Hurry.
We have no time to lose!
Too late, they are here!
Who's here?
!
What do you mean?
!
Who's here?
Huh?
There she is.
Get him!
Ooh, what's the matter?
Farewell, Your Highness.
Please tell Maharajah I have died for my country.
No no no!
We want royal secret.
Look, fellows, you got me all wrong, I You have red and black hair of Franistan royalty.
What is secret?
All right, I'll give you the secret.
It's every two weeks a cup of henna to a gallon of water.
I'm not a maharincess, I'm a henna-rinse-ess.
She will talk when the tiger gets here.
The tiger?
He knows all methods of oriental torture.
Water dripping on head.
Death by a thousand cuts.
Oh!
Ow!
The lingering death of the whips.
The tiger knows them all.
Well, so long, Lucy.
Ethel, Ethel, where are you going?
The tiger!
The tiger, the tiger.

Hail, tiger!
Ricky!
Hi, Ethel.
Fred Mertz!
Mr. Foster and Joe.
What is this?
!
Well, "what is this"?
You're asking me, eh?
When I found out that you were the Maharincess of Franistan I decided to scare the life out of you so you wouldn't try a fool thing like that again.
Oh, well, how did you find out?
How did I find out who else but you would listen to me sing 25 songs and ask for more?
Well, I don't think it was very funny.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
You scared us half to death.
Oh, Ethel, were you scared?
I knew it was Ricky and Fred all the time.
It didn't bother me
{END OF EPISODE 31}{START OF EPISODE 32}
Hi!
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Hi, kids.
Well, what do we watch?
Comedy?
Drama?
Soap opera?
I don't care.
Anything but wrestling.
Ricky, wait a minute let's not watch television tonight.
Not watch television?
!
What else is there to do?
Well, whatever happened to that game we used to play before television was invented?
It was called conversation.
Oh, yeah, how did that go?
You know, the four of us used to just sit around all evening and talk.
Nothing so unusual about it.
In millions of homes all over the country other people were having the same kind of conversations we were having.
Yeah, that's why television was invented.
Go on, Rick, turn it on, will you?
Now, wait a minute, Fred.
Maybe Lucy's got something there.
Yeah, we're four intelligent, interesting people.
Let's just talk- exchange ideas.
Okay.
All right.
Well, what do we talk about?
Anything.
Just let the conversation flow.
Let it go where it wants to.
All right.
Okay, let's start.
Well, come on, let's talk.
Um how about those elections?
They were really something, huh?
I guess so.
Elections?
Yeah, yeah, I what about them?
Well, they had them, all right.
Oh.
Oh, come now someone must know something to say.
Oh What do we watch?
Let's see what's on, eh?
Okay.
Hey, hey, that's good.
Oh, it's a movie.
That's a pretty new movie for television.
New?
Yeah, that little girl is Margaret O'Brien, isn't it?
Look again- it's Shirley Temple.
Look again- it's Mary Pickford.
Hey, that's not tuned in right.
I'll get it lighter.
There.
Oh, honey, that's too light.
But don't make it too dark now.
Well, if it's too light, it hurts my eyes.
Well, compromise.
All right, how's that?
All right, that's good now.
Fine.
That's good.
What are those lines across there?
There's too much contrast.
I'll fix it.
There how does it look now?
Well, I can see the lines much better.
Well, let's try it this way.
There, the lines are fading.
Yeah, the lines are gone.
So is the picture.
Well, wait a minute, will you?
Okay, okay.
All right, leave it!
Leave it alone, leave it alone!
Sit down, will you?
That's fine now!
Sit down.
You think that's in focus?
What?
You think the picture is sharp enough?
Yeah.
It's all right.
Ah, I can get it much sharper than that.
There, that's what I call in focus.
Honey, that's too light.
All right.
Uh-oh, that's too dark.
Can't you get rid of those lines?
Ricky, why couldn't you have left it alone?
It was fine for all of us.
Well, I'll get it, honey, I'll get it.
Now, listen, let me do it.
Honey, I know how to do it.
I've had it Honey, please, I know Oh!
Now see what you've done!
Me?
!
Well, that's the end of television for tonight.
Good, I'm glad.
Now what are we going to do?
Well, we could try conversation again but personally I'm all worn out from the last gabfest.
We could make fudge and dress up in our mothers' clothes.
Yeah, that's the best idea yet.
Oh, wait a minute.
My goodness!
Look!
A radio!
Well, what do you know?
It takes a little time to warm up.
Well, what are we staring at?
This is a radio.
Testing, testing Mr. and Mrs. Eric Findley, meet Freddy Fillmore.
Oh, I remember this show- Freddy Fillmore, Mr. and Mrs. Quiz.
How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Findley?
Now, here are your three $100 questions.
First, who was the youngest man to be inaugurated president of the United States?
Theodore Roosevelt.
Theodore Roosevelt?
Oh, no, it was one of the earlier ones- Adams or McKinley, wasn't it, Ethel?
Ask Fred, he was probably there.
Oh, time's up, I'm so sorry.
The youngest president was 42 years old the day of his inauguration and his name was Theodore Roosevelt.
Well!
What do you know about that?
You were right- how did you know that?
Doesn't everybody?
"Doesn't everybody"?
Oh-ho-ho!
Now, Mr. and Mrs. Findley, here's your second question and remember, only one answer between you: What was the last state to be admitted to the union?
I know what that was- uh, Nebraska, Nebraska.
No, it was New Mexico.
Wyoming.
It was Arizona.
Arizona?
MR.
Er, was it Arizona?
You are so right!
The last state to be admitted to the union was Arizona!
And you now have $100!
Now for your third question: What was the date of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address?
Well, brain?
November 19 Come on, now, Mr. Findley, take a guess.
Mrs. Findley?
Sorry, but your time is up.
The answer is November 9, 1863.
Ha!
Oh!
Oh, oh, I beg your pardon, I read that wrong.
The answer is November 19, 1863.
Ha!
That's too bad, Mr. and Mrs. Findley, but you do have $100 and a chance at our $500 jackpot question.
Oh, wait a minute, we don't have enough time left so we'll just have to ask you the jackpot question at the beginning of our next program.
We're a little late, folks so this is Freddy Fillmore saying good night and remember to tune in every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I'm very surprised at you.
How did you happen to know the answer to those questions?
Well, who do you think you're married to, a country pumpkin?
We studied American history in Cuba too, you know.
Well, you're certainly a lot smarter than I am.
I got all I can do to remember that there are 46 states.
Forty-eight.
Oh, yeah I guess I forgot Alaska and Hawaii.
Yeah.
Hey, honey will you fix us some sandwiches?
Sandwiches?
Yeah, sandwiches- two pieces of bread with a thing in the middle and the mustard on the top.
Oh, eat, eat, eat, all they want to Come on, Ethel, help me.
Hey, you sure fooled me, Rick.
I'd have bet you couldn't answer those questions.
I got something to tell you about that, old man.
What?
That's why I send them out of the room.
You know, that program was a delayed broadcast.
Yeah?
Yeah, they made it this afternoon and I was at the station when they were doing it.
I heard the whole thing.
Then you knew the answers before they asked them.
Shh!
Yeah.
Boy, you you tricky Cuban.
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo.
What are you doing?
I thought we were going shopping.
Oh, I guess I was just daydreaming about Ricky knowing the answers to all those questions last night.
Just think, he would have won $300- $100 for each question.
Gosh.
Three crisp, new, green $100 bills.
Is that the way you see it?
Uh-huh.
I see it all in pennies and I'm running barefoot through it.
Oh, well, we might as well stop dreaming.
Wait a minute, why do we have to dream?
Why can't he go on that program and win all the money?
Sure.
Do you think he'd do it?
Why not?
He knows all the answers.
Besides, it'd give him a chance to show off, the big ham.
I'm going to call the station right now.
Hey, you might win that $500 jackpot then you'd really be rich.
Yeah, I'd have golden eggs all over the house.
Huh?
I didn't realize what kind of a goose I was married to.
Freddy Fillmore, please.
Say, wait a minute.
It's a Mr. and Mrs. Quiz show.
You'll have to go on it, too.
So what?
Ricky will answer all the questions.
I'll just stand there, keep my mouth shut.
Uh, Freddy Fillmore?
Mr. Fillmore, this is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Mr. Fillmore, I don't know if you know it or not but my husband is one of the smartest men in the United States.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, and if you play your cards right you might be able to get him on your program.
Uh-huh that's right.
Well, I'm sure he'd be glad to.
Hi, honey.
Oh, Ricky, am I glad you're home in time.
Time for what?
I have a big surprise for you.
Really?
What is it?
I won't tell you until 7:00.
Oh?
I was so proud of you last night knowing the answers to all those questions.
Well, honey, I have something to tell you about that, too.
Wait a minute- it's 7:00.
Now, what is it?
Well, you see, that program that we heard last night was a delayed broadcast and I was down at the station when they were doing it and that's the reason that I knew all the answers.
What's the matter, honey?
Xyza, Ricky Ricardo.
Yes, be sure to tune in for the Mr. and Mrs. Quiz program tomorrow night when Freddy Fillmore's special guests will be Mr. and Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Oh, no.
Lucy before I kill you would you mind telling me the details?
Well, you were so smart last night and you knew all the answers and I thought you were a cinch to win all the money so I called the radio station And why did you call the radio station without asking me first?
Well, how did I know that you were faking?
I thought you were an overgrown Cuban quiz kid.
Look, all I know is that Columbus discover Ohio in 1776.
Oh, fine.
Well, what are we going to do now?
What are we going to do now?
We'll have to go through with it.
It's been announced on the air.
I can't back out now.
But you know something?
What?
Tomorrow night, when we get on that show you better know the answers.
What are you going to do if I don't?
It's too horrible to think about.
Eew!
Eew!
Hi, Mr. Fillmore.
Here are the questions for tonight.
Oh, good, Tommy.
Well, these ought to be hard enough.
Let's see if you can answer any of these, Tommy.
Eh, "To whom do you make your federal tax check out on March 15"?
You don't know that?
"How do subfreezing temperatures in the arctic affect the growth of trees"?
You don't know that one either?
"Why was the steamship Ile de France put in dry dock recently"?
I don't know any of those.
You mean to tell me you can't answer these questions?
Neither can I. Where are the answers?
Oh, didn't I bring them in?
I must have left them on my desk.
I'll go get them.
Say, there's a Mrs. Ricky Ricardo outside to see you.
Oh, yeah, she's one of the contestants.
Have her come in, will you?
Okay.
You may come in, Mrs. Ricardo.
Thank you.
You do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?
How do you do?
Awfully nice of you to come down.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Uh Mr. Fillmore, you can do me a tremendous favor.
You can get me out of a very big spot.
Anything you want, I'll do, Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, thank you very much.
And do you know why?
Why?
Because this is the biggest break I've ever had having you and your husband appear on my show tonight.
Oh?
Yes.
You see, I have an offer from a national sponsor who's willing to buy the program if I can get people like Ricky Ricardo to appear.
Oh.
And once he's appeared on the show tonight that'll pave the way for other celebrities.
Oh, I see.
You don't realize what a break this is for me.
Now, what can I do for you?
Uh could I have some tickets for the broadcast?
Well, certainly.
You can have all the tickets you want.
Pardon me, Mr. Fillmore here are the answers for tonight's questions.
Oh, thank you, Tommy.
Have we got some pips for you tonight.
You have?
Yes, we sure have.
Oh, that's right, you wanted those tickets.
Yes, please.
I'll take care of that right now.
Yes, Mr. Fillmore?
Nancy, will you see that Mrs. Ricardo gets all the tickets she wants, please?
Oh, excuse me.
Hello?
Oh, yeah, yeah, I've got them right here.
Yeah, we can check it.
One Yeah.
Uh, two Yeah.
Uh, three Uh, yeah.
Yeah, that checks.
Okay, now, would you read that opening commercial to me, please?
Uh-huh.
That sounds good.
Sure.
Okay.
Why, Mrs. Ricardo you wouldn't want to see the answers for tonight, would you?
Oh, were those the answers?
Well, yes.
You didn't see them, did you?
No, darn it.
Well, good.
Uh well Good-bye, Mr. Fillmore.
Oh, well good-bye, Mrs. Ricardo.
So nice of you to come by.
Thank you.
I'll see you tonight.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Hi, Lucy, you ready to go to the broadcast?
I was just going over these answers- see if I knew them.
Here, you hold the paper.
Uh, the first one is, "the collector of Internal Revenue.
" The second one is, "the sap runs every two years.
" The third is, "to scrape the barnacles off her hull.
" Perfect.
Wonder what the questions are?
Who cares, so long as I have the answers?
Come on, Come on.
We might as well get it over with.
Oh, honey, don't look so worried.
I have an idea I'm going to walk up there and give them those answers one, two, three.
You're so confident one would think you knew what the questions were going to be.
Yes, one would, wouldn't one?
Come on, come on, we're all going to be late.
All right!
Let's go.
Oh, I forgot something.
I'll be right with you.
All right.
Collector of Internal Revenue, the sap runs every two years to to scrape the barnacles off her hull.
Come on, honey, hurry up.
It's time for Mr. and Mrs. Quiz.
Yes, once again it's time to play that fascinating game, Mr. and Mrs. Quiz and here to ask the questions is that well-known quizmaster Freddy Fillmore!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and welcome once again to Mr. and Mrs. Quiz.
Now, for our first contestant tonight we have a gentleman known to all of you as an orchestra leader and a singer.
But what you don't know- and we didn't, either, until his wife told us today- he's one of the greatest brains of all time- a real top intellectual.
Yes, sirree.
And now, just in case you think we picked questions to make him look good tonight we're going to change our usual practice and have him select his questions out of this glass bowl, at random.
And now, here they are, Mr. and Mrs. Ricky Ricardo!
How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Ricardo?
How do you do?
You all ready for your questions?
Yes, sir.
Oh-ho, they're going to be pretty hard.
Oh, I'll bet they're not too hard.
Well, we'll see about that.
Now, remember, you only have one answer between the two of you.
Okay, dig right in there, Ricky.
Ah, here we go for number one.
Ah.
What is name of the animal that fastens itself to you and drains you of your blood?
The Collector of Internal Revenue.
Oh, I I I'm so sorry.
You only had one answer between the two of you and that's wrong.
It is?
Yes, the answer is, "a vampire bat.
" A vampire bat, sure- that's what I was going to say.
Well, let's try the next one.
Maybe we'll have better luck this time.
I'll get the next one.
Ah, here we go, number two: What is a senator's term of office?
The sap runs every two years.
Oh, I I'm sorry, Mrs. Ricardo but you're not giving your husband a chance.
A senator's term of office is six years.
Six years, sure.
Why don't you let me answer one?
Well, let's try the last one.
Let me answer this one, eh?
Here we go for number three.
Why did the French people put Marie Antoinette under the sharp blade of the guillotine?
Um Well?
You got any ideas?
Well, come on, Ricardos you must know the answer to this one.
Yeah, we know the answer to this one.
Okay, why did the French people put Marie Antoinette under the sharp blade of the guillotine?
To scrape the barnacles off her hull.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You are the first husband-and-wife team ever to miss all three questions.
What's the matter with you, honey?
Well, I memorized the answers but they must have switched the questions.
Oh, no, what have you done to me?
Well, anyway you still have a chance at the giant jackpot question and it's worth $500.
Ricky, it's not over yet.
Now, we've all seen the picture of George Washington crossing the Delaware.
You've seen that picture, haven't you?
Yeah, yeah.
And you've seen it too, haven't you?
Of course you have.
Now, what I want you to tell me is this: What did George Washington say while making that crossing?
Yeah, I'll repeat the question: What did George Washington say while crossing the Delaware?
Do you know, Ricky?
Please let me sit down, this is making me sick.
That's right!
That's what George Washington said when crossing the Delaware!
Five hundred bucks!
{END OF EPISODE 32}{START OF EPISODE 33}
Lucy, for goodness' sakes, aren't you ready yet?
I'll be ready in a minute, dear.
Hurry up, we're going to miss the start of the movie.
I'll be ready in a minute, dear.
I wonder what time that feature starts.
What did you do with the paper?
I'll be ready in a minute, dear.
"I'll be ready in a minute, dear.
" "I'll be ready in a minute, dear.
" Ay-ay-ay.
Oh, there it is.
High Noon, Gary Cooper I'll be ready in a minute, dear.
Ay-ay-ay.
Lucy, you haven't even got your dress on yet.
You were supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Well, it's all your fault.
My fault?
Yes, I wasted an hour telling you I'd be ready in a minute.
Oh, now, come on, what are you doing?
Now, honey, I'm almost ready and you're not helping any.
If you want to make yourself useful get a dress out for me to put on.
All right, all right.
Which dress you want to wear?
Well, which dress you want to put on?
I'm thinking.
I can't make up my mind.
Put on any dress, honey.
The Mertzes will be here in a minute.
What makes you think so?
I talked to Ethel ten minutes ago.
She wasn't anywhere near ready.
She'll be here.
Fred told me that tonight she's going to be here ready to go, with her coat on, at Hah!
If I know Ethel she's just about getting out of the tub.
Well, look, just in case they happen to be on time would you please decide which dress you want to put on?
Well, what dress would you like me to wear?
How about this one, eh?
You like that dress?
Yeah, sure, I like it, it's beautiful, fine.
No, Ethel's seen me in that so much.
How about this one?
Oh, honey, everybody's seen me in that.
Oh, I wouldn't wear that to a movie.
Why not?
Don't tell me Gary Cooper has seen you in it.
No, it's too tight.
Ay-ay-ay.
Hi, Rick, here we are!
You folks ready?
We'll be ready in a minute, dear.
Now you got me doing it.
You see, he's got Ethel up here, ready to go just like he said he would.
You go out and talk to them, dear.
I'll be right out.
Okay.
Now, look, if you're not ready in five minutes we're going to go without you.
Yes, dear.
All right.
Hiya, Fred, hi, Ethel.
Hi, Rick.
You did better than I did.
Lucy's still dressing.
You're not firm enough.
Well, I'll be firm enough tomorrow night, boy.
We're going to have dinner with the new buss.
You're having dinner with a bus?
Mr. Littlefield- the fellow that bought the nightclub- I work for him now; he's my buss.
Oh, I thought you meant bus like they have at the boss station.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well, she better be on time tomorrow night or she'll really be known as the late Mrs. Ricardo.
I heard that remark.
Hi, Fred.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi, Ethel.
Oh, gee, do you look pretty!
Is that new?
What's the matter with you?
Oh, she's mad at me.
When I say 8:00, ready or not, I mean it.
I don't get it.
Lucy, it's one minute to 7:00 and we're supposed to be there at I'll be ready in a minute, dear.
Lucy, I'm telling you I don't want anything to go wrong tonight.
I'm talking to Mr. Littlefield about making me the manager of the club.
Now, I'm going to give you 25 seconds What were you saying, dear?
Lucy, you're all dressed and ready to go.
Naturally.
Well, I apologize for everything I ever said.
How did you do it?
I played a little trick on myself.
What do you mean?
Well, knowing my own weakness I wanted to make sure that I'd be on time so I turned the clock back so I'd have an extra hour.
it's only 6:00, instead of 7:00.
Why, honey, that's wonderful.
I'm proud of you.
Thank you.
You know, I can really get things done if I just put my mind to it.
Oh, gee, I hope the Littlefields have a good dinner.
I'm starved.
Me, too- I didn't have any lunch.
You know, that clock idea is real clever.
I should have thought of that a long time ago.
Come on, honey.
Okay, dear.
Gee, look how dark it is, and it's only 6:00.
Yeah, well, the days are getting shorter.
No, they're not, they're getting longer.
Lucy?
What?
Which way did you turn this clock?
Forward or backwards?
Backwards, so I'd get an extra hour.
Oh, no!
You should have turned it forward.
Forward?
Sure, then when it said 7:00 it would only be 6:00.
It's now 8:00.
Eww We'll be an hour late for dinner.
Come on, will you?
Oh, no!
Alvin, what do you suppose could have happened to the Ricardos?
I can't imagine.
I told them dinner at 7:30.
It's nearly 8:30 now.
Really, when I realize how you rushed me.
"Have it ready on time.
" "Have it ready on time.
" "Be sure it's ready on time.
" Phoebe, you know I consider tardiness a major sin.
I wish I could get you to feel that way.
Oh, darling, why do you persist in sneaking these in here?
They're so cheap-looking.
We can afford real fruit, you know.
Alvin Mama gave us that wax fruit for our wedding anniversary.
You put it right back I don't care, Phoebe  Oh, there they are now.
Well, come in, come in, come in.
I don't believe you've met Mrs. Littlefield.
Phoebe, may I present Mrs. Ricardo, Mr. Ricardo.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Pleasure.
I'm so sorry that we're late.
It's just disgraceful.
It's quite all Won't you sit down?
Mr. Ricardo you come and sit here next to me.
Thank you, thank you.
Gee, I hope we haven't ruined your dinner.
Oh, not at all.
Of course not.
Oh, that's good.
It was delicious.
You mean you finished dinner?
Oh, some time ago.
When I say 7:30, I mean 7:30.
Oh.
Of course, I could fix you something even though everything has been put away and the dishes are all washed.
Oh, well, I hate to bother you, but, gee, I'm so darn hungry No, thank you, Mrs. Littlefield, we've eaten.
But Ricky We've eaten.
See, when we saw that we couldn't get a cab right away we had a little snack.
MRS.
Oh, well, if you're quite sure.
It's too bad you couldn't make it for dinner.
Phoebe outdid herself.
It wasn't anything special.
Just pork chops.
Pork chops?
Oh, they're my favorite.
Oh, then you would have loved these.
They were stuffed and about that thick.
About that thick?
And the potatoes were a masterpiece.
Now, Alvin!
But they were, my dear, they were- baked, and with big globs of cheese and butter.
Big globs of cheese and butter?
I must have gained five pounds what, with all that cheese and butter and the hollandaise sauce.
Hollandaise sauce?
What was it on?
Asparagus tips- fresh, tender asparagus tips.
Are you sure you've both had dinner?
Oh, yes, we had plenty.
Didn't we, Lucy?
Hollandaise sauce, huh?
Perhaps you'd like an after-dinner mint.
Oh, where are they?
Where are they?
Well, I think I have room for just one teensy- weensy mint.
I always say there's nothing quite  There's nothing quite like a good after-dinner mint, is there?
Oh!
I'll get some more.
I must say, Mr. Ricardo I hope this being late isn't a habit with you.
I like punctuality in the people who work for me.
Oh, yes, I know.
This was just an accident, sir.
Well, I hope it was.
Mrs. Ricardo!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Honey, I don't know what you're so upset about.
The Littlefields understood when we explained the clock business.
Mrs. Littlefield cooked dinner for us, didn't she?
It doesn't matter.
It was very embarrassing.
She wouldn't have had to go through all that trouble if you would have been on time.
Now, how long does it take you in the bathtub?
To do what?
What are you writing there?
"Lucy's schedule"?
Lucy who?
Lucy you, that's who.
Let me see this.
I'm making out a schedule so you can budget your time.
Budget my time?
You mean like I budget my money?
Heaven forbid.
Give me that.
Now, Ricky, listen You listen to me.
Now, I'm sick and tired of you being late all the time.
It's obvious you cannot budget your time so somebody has to do it for you.
Well, I don't think I'm going to like this.
How does it go?
Well, we'll write down everything that you do and we'll allow so much time for each thing- ten minutes for this, 15 minutes for that Oh, I'm going to need more than 15 minutes for that.
Never mind.
You're going to go on this schedule and you're starting tomorrow morning, understand?
Good morning, dear.
Good morning.
How about a good-morning kiss?
Sorry, it's not on the schedule.
You know, as a matter of fact I want to congratulate you on the way you've been budgeting your time in the last few days.
Well, as much as I hate to admit it, this thing does seem to work.
Good.
Is breakfast ready?
Yep, all set.
There's nothing on the stove.
Where is it?
Well, I knew I wouldn't have time to cook it this morning.
So, I had some time left over last night so I cooked breakfast last night.
You did what?
Don't worry about it spoiling.
It's all in the freezer.
Lucy, I can't eat this egg.
Why not?
It's too salty.
Well, I'd cook you another one but it would throw me off schedule.
Never mind, I have an appointment with Mr. Littlefield.
Just give me some coffee, huh?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Lucy What's the matter?
You always like iced coffee.
More coffee, Ricky?
Oh, yes, thank you.
Another roll?
Don't mind if I do.
Don't you people ever eat at your house?
Yes, sir.
It's just that I have a very big appetite.
Oh.
Oh, I see.
Well, let's get down to business.
I've been thinking over your suggestion about being the manager of the club and I'd like to talk to you about it.
Well, certainly.
I've been watching you and I like the way you handle things.
Oh, thank you.
In fact, you have all the qualifications to be manager of the Tropicana.
Oh, well, then can I can I get the job?
No.
Oh.
I'd say yes, except for one little thing- that business about being late for dinner the other night.
Oh, but that was my wife's fault.
Oh, that's just it.
If a man can't run his own home I certainly can't give him a nightclub to manage.
Uh, cigarette?
Yes, thank you.
You can appreciate my position, of course.
Oh, yes, sir, I do, of course I do.
Uh You see, Mr. Littlefield, you don't understand.
That was before.
Things are all different now.
Oh?
Oh, yes, sir.
The other night when I got home, I laid down the law.
I made out a schedule and I'm making her stick to it.
And?
It's working fine.
She's really doing what you say?
Oh, sir, I got her jumping around like a trained seal.
A trained seal.
Oh, I sure would like to see a thing like that.
Well, why don't you come for dinner tonight and you can see how the schedule works?
May I bring my wife?
Certainly.
Then she can see that a house can be run on schedule.
If it works the way you say it does, you can be the new manager.
Thank you very much.
Hi.
Oh, oh!
Hi, Ethel.
Uh sit down.
I have three and a half minutes to spare.
Listen, Lucy, you're going to have to cut out this schedule business.
Why?
'Cause Fred thinks it's a wonderful idea.
If it works out, he's going to put me on one.
Well, truthfully, Ethel I find that I get everything done and I have time left over.
Of course, I cheated a little bit.
What do you mean, you cheated a little bit?
I drew in an extra hour at the bottom of the chart.
Where did you get the extra hour?
From the next day.
From the next day?
Yeah, it'll work out fine till the end of the year and then I'll be two weeks short.
Who can that be?
Oh, Mrs. Littlefield!
How do you do?
Come in, won't you?
Uh, this is my neighbor Ethel Mertz.
This is Mrs. Littlefield.
Sit down, won't you?
Thank you.
Well, I I didn't expect you until tonight.
Mrs. Ricardo, what are you trying to do to the wives of America?
I beg your pardon?
Your husband told my husband that you're running this house on a time schedule.
That's right.
You Benedict Arnold.
What do you mean?
We wives have spent years persuading our husbands that we haven't time to do our work.
Now, if you go through with this you'll louse it up for all of us.
You're darned right.
My husband wants to put me on a schedule, too.
If my Alvin sees what he likes here at dinner tonight I start punching a time clock tomorrow.
Well, I can't let Ricky down.
He's asked you here tonight to show you how proud he is of me.
Oh, yes?
Well, I overheard him tell my husband that he had you hopping around like a trained seal.
Oh, he didn't mean it like that.
No, of course not.
Trained seal, huh?
It was probably just an unfortunate choice of words when he invited us here tonight to "watch you perform.
" "Watch me perform"?
Well, I'm sorry, but you're not going to see me balance a ball on my nose tonight.
Good girl!
Lucy, what are you going to do?
Will you and Fred come to dinner tonight?
Sure.
This is no time for formality.
Phoebe, will you help me?
Lucy, I'll do anything.
Thank you.
Me, too.
Thank you.
Trained seals of the world, unite!
Lucy?
Yes, dear?
Are you sure dinner is going to be ready when the Littlefields get here?
Now, don't worry, dear.
Everything will come off right on schedule.
Good girl.
I got to hand it to you- that schedule idea was a real brainstorm.
I'm putting Ethel on one tomorrow.
Attaboy!
You know, that little idea is going to make me a nightclub manager.
Good.
Here they are.
Come on in, come on in.
Hello, good evening, Mr. Littlefield.
How are you?
Oh!
Sit right down here, Mr. Littlefield.
Oh, I'd like you to meet Mr. Mertz.
Mr. Littlefield.
How do you do?
Sit right down.
Come in, Mrs. Littlefield.
Right over in here.
Lucy.
What?
What is this?
Well, can't waste time.
Got to keep on schedule, you know.
Oh, oh.
Oh, Mr. Little the schedule, you know, Mr. Littlefield, the schedule.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, very interesting.
Well, let's talk.
How have you been, Mr. Littlefield?
Oh, fine, fine.
I had a cold, but I went to the doctor.
He gave me a shot.
It went right away.
Of course, there's been a lot of colds going around Time's up!
How are you, Fred?
Not so good- I got kind of a hitch Sorry.
Mr. Littlefield used up all your time.
How about a drink?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
I'd love one!
Yeah, so would I; had a hard day.
A drink would just hit the spot.
Well, it's too bad we don't have time for one.
Well, let's sit down and eat.
You sit right here, Mr. Littlefield.
Fred, you're right across from Mr. Littlefield.
Mrs. Littlefield, would you help me in the kitchen?
I'd love to.
Lucy, Mrs. Littlefield is a guest.
I don't mind.
She doesn't mind.
Well, I'm really hungry.
Me, too.
Well, that's good because Lucy's a wonderful little cook, you know.
Yes, sir!
Soup.
Soup!
Oh, and doesn't that look good.
Isn't that nice?
Well, dig in, everybody.
Lucy, where are you going?
It's all the time we had for soup.
Got to stick to the schedule, you know.
The schedule.
I didn't have time to taste it.
Too bad.
It was delicious.
I wonder what kind it was.
Split pea, I think.
Split pea, yep.
Salad.
Salad!
Well, this is a nice salad.
Looks fine.
Doesn't that look good.
That is really  Did you get any?
Me, either.
Look, look.
There's a radish.
Ah!
Lucy!
What are you trying to do?
Just trying to stay on schedule.
I'll talk to you later.
Well, okay.
I think I have some free time at What's the matter, Mr. Littlefield?
There's a shirt button in my water glass!
Lucy!
Yes, dear?
There's a shirt button in Mr. Littlefield's water glass!
Oh, well, I know how that happened.
You see, I found that I could save time by washing the dishes and the clothes together.
What is this?
Steak and peas.
They look frozen.
They are.
You see, there's no time on the schedule for defrosting.
But don't worry.
We have some nice hot biscuits.
Ethel, let's have those biscuits!
Here we go, girl!
Right smack through the middle!
There we go, yes, sir!
Pass them right along.
That a girl!
Come on, Ethel, that's it, kid!
Faster, faster.
There we go.
Come on, a little faster!
That a girl, kid.
Right straight through the middle!
That a girl, very good.
Just Just a minute!
I've had enough of this.
I tell you  Mr. Littlefield, please.
Please, Mr. Littlefield.
I think I can explain this, Mr. Littlefield.
So can I!
You've got this poor girl terrified.
She's scared to death of you.
She's afraid of losing a second.
Anyone can see that.
Yeah!
What a temper you must have.
Yeah.
It's one thing wearing the trousers in the family but it's another being a Simon Legree an ogre, a a Monster.
Yeah.
Well, maybe I have been cracking down a little bit too hard.
MR.
I should say you have.
Now, first, we're going to get rid of this nonsense!
Yes, sir.
Being a slave driver is no way to run a home.
No, sir.
But it's the only way to run a nightclub, Mr. Manager.
Mr. Manager!
{END OF EPISODE 33}{START OF EPISODE 34}
Lucy, what are you doing?
Honey, remember what you said to me the first time you met me?
I sure do.
I said you were a cute little chicken.
Well, I got something to tell you about this cute little "shicken"- she has crow's-feet.
You do not.
You don't even know what crow's-feet are.
I do, too.
They're like pigeon toes.
No, they're little lines around the eyes.
Come here, look.
See?
Oh, honey, are you kidding?
You're beautiful.
Aw, you're just being nice, Ricky.
I am not.
It doesn't really bother me.
I knew the day would come when I'd have crow's-feet and your hairline started to recede but I just didn't expect it so soon that's all.
But if you say I'm beautiful, I'll take your word for it.
Because after all, you're the only one I have to please.
All you have to do to make me happy is say that you still love me- do you?
My hairline is starting to recede, huh?
Oh, honey, that's just a figure of speech.
You haven't got anything to worry about.
Oh, I have, too.
I'm starting to lose my hair.
Ricky, don't be ridiculous.
My hairline is receding.
Look, honey, look.
Are you crazy?
You should have as much money as you have hair.
Well, I'm sure this much of my forehead didn't show before.
You're not serious.
If your hairline was any lower they'd have to bill you as "Ricky Ricardo, Boy Sheepdog.
" Well, it's thick enough on top but gee, that hairline.
Oh, so your hairline has receded a quarter of an inch.
So what?
Quarter of an inch?
Do you think it's that much?
And they say women are vain.
Vanity has nothing to do with this.
I'm only thinking of my career.
Oh.
Well, you'd make a nice fountain.
What are you doing?
I think it's getting thin in the back, right here.
It's getting thin back here in the back.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Come on to bed, baldy.
"Baldy.
" Ay, que barbaridad.
Tiene razon.
Se me va a caer el pelo y me va a llamar "Baldy".
Como la aguila americana.
Stop muttering in Spanish.
I refuse.
I won't do it.
I will not get bald!
Well, don't talk to me.
Speak to your scalp.
Look, you're not losing your hair and even if you were there's nothing you can do about it.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Worrying won't do it any good.
Certainly not.
Yeah.
Good night, darling.
I wonder how I'd look without any hair.
Ricky, good night.
Oh oh.
Good night.
Good night, honey.
No, no, no.
Ricky, breakfast is ready, dear!
Coming!
Well, you are in a hurry.
What are you wearing your What's the matter?
You're afraid I'll steal it?
No.
Well, what are you wearing your hat for?
I thought it might rain.
Well, now that you mention it the ceiling does look pretty cloudy.
My head was cold.
Oh.
Besides, you never can tell when the plaster might fall down.
All right, all right, I'm not asking you.
You got any jam?
Yep.
Lucy, I want And what's the big idea of that?
You're right the ceiling doesn't look any too safe.
Is my toast ready?
Coming up.
Honey, take off your hat.
I feel like I'm having breakfast in a beanery.
Well, what are you wearing your hat for, anyway?
Well, so I won't get embarrassed with everybody staring at my receding hairline.
Oh, I give up.
And please, no more jokes about it.
This is a serious matter.
All right, who's making jokes?
I'll see you later.
Hi.
Hi, Luc.
Hi.
What's the matter with you?
Oh, I was just thinking about Ricky.
He's off on a new kick.
He thinks he's getting bald.
Ricky?
Bald?
Yeah, he actually thinks his hairline is receding.
He wore a hat at breakfast.
Wait a minute.
It's no laughing matter, Ethel.
I can understand how he feels now that my hairline has started to recede.
Aw, honey, your hairline isn't starting to recede.
Let me see.
Turn around.
Never mind, I got plenty hair.
It comes way down over my eyes.
Yeah, you better cut it.
People will think you're a girl.
Very comical.
Oh, Lucy, you're kidding about Ricky.
Why, he's got lots of hair.
I know it, but he's got this crazy idea and he believes it.
I got to snap him out of it somehow.
How?
Well, I thought maybe I'd invite someone over that was really bald just to point up the comparisons.
Mmm- that's a good idea.
Yeah.
Now, who do we know that's bald?
Yeah.
Fred, would you, uh Would I what?
Would you like a cup of coffee?
No, thanks.
What are you laughing at, Curly?
I was just thinking of what Lucy's in for.
What?
Well, Ricky will start trying one hair-restoring treatment after another just like every other man when he thinks he's getting bald.
What kind of treatments?
Well, you wouldn't believe some of them.
Massagers, tonics, poultices scalp scrapers, suction devices freezing the scalp, burning the scalp.
Why, a man will try anything if he thinks he's losing his hair.
Fred, you've given me an idea.
I'm going to give Ricky scalp treatments.
And they're going to be so drastic that he'd be glad to forget the whole thing.
It won't work.
Why not?
Nothing has ever been invented that a man won't try if he thinks he can get his hair back.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you haven't heard of the Lucy Ricardo torture system of hair restoring.
Oh.
How do you do?
I'm Mr. Thurlow, may I help you?
Yes, I'd like to get some preparations that will grow hair.
I see- won't you sit down?
Thank you.
What are you looking at me like that for?
Oh, it's nothing, nothing.
Now, what did you have in mind?
Well, my husband thinks that he's losing his hair and I'd like to get several kinds of preparations.
I see, Mrs?
Ricardo.
Mrs. Ricardo, every case that comes to my attention requires its own special treatment.
Now, I can't do anything unless you're willing to be frank with me.
Just how bald are you?
Well Me?
It isn't me.
It's my husband.
Oh, your husband, yes.
Of course.
Of all the nerve.
You think I actually came in here to buy all these things for myself?
Oh, no, no, no.
Farthest thought from my mind.
Well, that's better.
But But what?
Well You could at least let me show you a more realistic- looking wig than that.
Wig?
This is my own hair.
Oh, come now.
Well, it is- see?
I beg your pardon.
My goodness, so it is.
Now, if you don't mind, would you please show me some of those hair-growing things?
What would you like?
We have ointments, salves, creams, tonics, scrapers vibrators, suction devices and agitators.
Would you like me to demonstrate them?
No, you just pick out some for me.
Yes, madam.
Um Pick out the ones that smell the worst and hurt the most.
Yes, madam.
Well, I've been waiting for you to call me.
How did the torture treatment work?
Ethel, I just didn't have the nerve to do it to him.
You should have seen some of the things I was going to use.
Awful, huh?
Yeah, there must be some less drastic way to snap him out of it.
Well, I still say your original idea was a good one.
What was that?
Surround him with people who are really bald and make him realize how much hair he has.
Bald people- a lot of them.
Yeah, that might work.
I'm going to give a party and everybody there is going to be as bald as a billiard ball.
Will you help me?
You don't expect me to shave my head, do you?
No.
I wonder how many bald-headed men we know?
I want this place looking like a sea of honeydew melons.
Well, I can ask Fred and Wait a minute.
Why didn't I think of this before?
I know a man who can put his finger on a hundred bald heads.
Who?
Mr. Thurlow, the hair-restorer man.
Hi.
Lucy, don't count on Fred.
He's not coming to your bald-headed party.
Why not?
When I asked him, he got highly insulted and stalked out of the room and I haven't seen him since.
Aw, too bad.
Well, I guess we'll have enough without him.
Can I help you with anything?
Yeah, honey, put some of those around for me, will you?
Okay.
How did Mr. Thurlow get all those men to come here tonight, anyway?
Well, it seems that they all took treatments at the same time and he told them it was a class reunion.
Ah, bless their little bald heads.
There they are.
Oh, good evening, Mr. Thurlow.
Good evening, Mrs. Ricardo.
Come in, gentlemen.
May I present Mr. Johnson Mr. Miller and Mr. Davis.
How do you do?
And this is Mrs. Mertz, Mr. Thurlow.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Mr. Johnson, Mr. Miller and Mr. Davis.
How do you do?
There are six more coming.
Oh, fine, fine.
May I take your hats, gentlemen?
Mrs. Ricardo I had a tough time getting the boys to come.
I had to promise you'd give them dinner.
Dinner?
Oh, well, I guess we can take them out somewhere.
And I had to promise you'd give them each ten dollars.
Ten dollars?
And there are six more coming?
$90?
Gee whiz.
Well, we do have $100 that we keep for emergencies.
Well, I guess this is an emergency.
Pardon me.
There you are, $90.
Thank you, Mrs. Ricardo.
Okay, boys, let me have your hats.
There you are.
Mr. Thurlow!
Well, business hasn't been so good lately.
I need the ten bucks.
Thank you.
Sit down, gentlemen.
All I can say is this better work.
Oh, Fred.
Come on in.
Hello, Lucy.
Gee, I'm so glad you could come.
Good old Fred.
He always comes through in a pinch.
Aw, shucks.
Could I have your hat, Fred?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I guess that evens things up.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Hi, honey.
LUCY : Hi.
I won't be able to get home.
I got a lot of work to do.
Oh, honey.
Can't you just get home for a minute?
What for?
Well, I have a new treatment I want to try on you for baldness.
Well, it'll just have to wait.
But it can't wait.
It's a very expensive treatment.
Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I got a lot of work to do.
I'll see you later, good-bye.
Is he coming home?
No, darn it.
This is what I get for being so softhearted.
It cost me a hundred bucks.
What now?
Torture system, here I come.
Lucy!
I'm in here, dear, in the kitchen.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Oh, a beret.
Say, you look very continental.
Yeah.
What's all this stuff?
Well, I went down to one of those hair-restoring places today and I am going to give you scalp treatments to make your hair grow back.
Scalp treatments?
Yeah.
Do you think these things really work?
They're guaranteed.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Come on, sit down.
Let's get started.
All right.
Your roots won't know what hit them.
There we are.
Now, you just relax.
There, now First we're going to wake up your scalp with a stimulating vibration.
Honey cut it out, will you?
Now, honey, you want to grow hair, don't you?
Yeah, yeah.
Makes your whole scalp tingle, doesn't it?
Yeah, my head feels like it's on fire.
Good, that means we got your scalp on the run.
Now for a little brush job.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Yes, I read all the instructions.
Now, this is the one that really does the trick.
Honey, my eyes.
I don't My eyebrows are all right.
I don't need any hair there.
There, I think we're making progress.
Your scalp has a nice, red, healthy- looking glow.
You sure it isn't blood?
Oh.
Here, try this on for size.
What's this for?
To cover the mustard plaster.
The mustard plaster?
Yeah, after you get the mustard plaster on you wear the stocking to bed.
I wear the stocking to bed?
Yeah.
Well, I don't get it, but I'll do it.
Oh, honey!
Not on your foot, on your head.
On my head?
Yes.
The next part of this treatment is very gooey.
After I get the mustard plaster on your head you wear a stocking over it all night.
Oh oh, I didn't know.
Honey, it's awfully tight.
Well, I'm sorry, that's the biggest stocking I could find.
Honey, take it off!
Take it off!
I'm only doing what you told me to do.
Now, never mind.
You wear it on top like a cap.
I'll fix it later.
Here, now, you hold onto that.
Leave that right there now.
Put your neck in here and hold onto the bowl.
Put your head over.
What are you putting on now?
Oil, to lubricate your scalp.
Oh.
What's that?
Vinegar, to marinate your scalp.
Eggs?
Honey What are you doing now?
Mixing in the egg.
Oil, vinegar, eggs Why don't you put some anchovies, make a Caesar salad?
What is that?
What are you doing?
What is that?
Hey!
What is that?
What are you doing?
What's that you're doing now?
What's that for?
That's a heat cap.
What's that you put on now?
It's a heat cap, you have to bake for Is that the end of the treatment?
Yeah, that's it, but we have to do that every other night for six months.
Six months, huh?
Yeah, how about that?
Well you know something?
What?
My scalp is tingling.
I can feel something happening already.
Yeah?
Well, you have to do it every other night, you know.
I think we ought to do it every night.
What?
Then my hair will grow in faster.
Oh, no.
{END OF EPISODE 34}{START OF EPISODE 35}
Hurry up, honey.
The Littlefields will be here any minute.
Well, how do I look?
Oh, you look wonderful, dear.
Oh, fine, how could I look wonderful?
I have on an old house dress and haven't even done my hair.
Well, why not?
Well, I thought maybe if I didn't look too good it would help things along when you ask Mr. Littlefield for that raise tonight.
Now, Lucy Maybe I ought to suck in my cheeks so he'll think we don't get enough to eat.
Now, you listen to me, honey Hmm?
Look, I don't want you to try any of your crazy stunts tonight.
Honey, you promised me you were going to ask him for a raise.
I will, I will!
I just don't want you to go pushing me into it.
Ricky, if you're afraid to ask for a raise you're never going to get it.
I'm not afraid; I'll do it.
Well, what are you going to say?
Let's rehearse.
Rehearse?
Sure.
You can't leave a thing like this to chance.
Now, look, I'll pretend I'm Mr. Littlefield and you pretend you're you.
Now, we've finished dinner.
Mr. Littlefield is full of food and he's leaning back, weak, bloated and vulnerable.
: Ricardo, my boy, your wife sure is a good cook.
Go ahead, Ricky, here's where you speak up.
Uh uh Mr. Littlefield Yes, my boy, what's on your mind?
Uh I was wondering Yes?
You couldn't give me any more money next year, could you?
Well, that ought to sweep him off his feet.
Honey, if he wants to give me a raise that will do it.
Honey, nobody ever wants to give anybody a raise.
You have to demand it.
Now, look, you be Mr. Littlefield and I'll be you- go ahead, sit down.
You're Mr. Littlefield.
All right.
My boy, that was a good meal.
Well, Mr. Littlefield I want to talk to you about my new contract.
How much of a raise am I getting?
How much?
Yes, how much?
You know, Mr. Littlefield I have to decide whether to stay with you or accept one of my many other offers.
I don't have any other offers.
Oh, well, honey, I know that but Mr. Littlefield doesn't know it.
Now put yourself in his place.
Think- how would you react, honestly?
Well, Mr. Littlefield are you going to top those other offers or do I quit?
What do you say?
Don't quit, my boy.
I'll give you the raise.
See?
Hey, I got the raise!
That's right.
What do you know?
How about that?
Yeah I just hope the Littlefield sees thins that lowgically.
Don't worry; he'll see "thins" that "lowgically.
" Come on, let's go into the parlor and wait for the fly.
Oh, that was a wonderful dinner.
Your wife certainly knows how to cook, Ricky.
Oh, thank you.
Phoebe, I want you to get Mrs. Ricardo's recipe for that cheesecake.
It was delicious.
Yes, Alvin, I'd love it, Lucy, if you'll give it to me.
Oh, I'd be glad to.
I'll write it out before you leave.
Did you say something?
No, no, but Ricky has something to ask you don't you, dear?
Uh Oh, no, not really, it can wait.
No, go ahead, dear.
Yes, Ricky, what is it?
Well, um Mr. Littlefield Yes?
Mr. Littlefield, you and I are going to have to have a talk very soon about my new contract.
And there's one thing I have to know and I have to know it right away.
What's that?
You couldn't give me any more money next year, could you?
Well as a matter of fact, Ricky I've been thinking over the idea of giving you a raise.
Yes?
And my boy it's out of the question.
Why?
The nightclub business isn't what it used to be- taxes have come up, things are more expensive.
So you can see that I'm in no position to give you any more money.
Oh, yes, sir, absolutely it's out of the question.
You want any more coffee, Mrs. Littlefield?
Well, Ricky, I guess you're just going to have to accept one of those other offers then.
"Other offers"?
Yes, Ricky wasn't going to say anything- he's so loyal, you know- but other clubs have been clamoring for him.
Really?
Oh, I wouldn't say Just the other day a club owner called- I won't mention any names- and offered Ricky twice as much money as you're paying him.
It wasn't twice as much.
Oh, no, that's right, it was three times as much.
But Ricky said, "No, no, if it's at all possible I want to stay with good old Mr. Littlefield.
" Didn't you, Ricky?
Oh, yes, yeah, yeah- my zact words.
His "zact" words.
Well, that's very flattering.
You understand, Mr. Littlefield I don't want to leave.
I want to stay right where I am.
I don't want to go anyplace, you know.
I'm happy there.
But the people- they're offering me so much money I mean, I, uh I don't know what else to do, you know.
I see, I see your problem.
Uh, how many such offers have you had?
Four.
Twelve.
Um I got eight more this morning.
Oh Well, Mr. Littlefield?
Oh, this is a very difficult decision.
Very difficult, very difficult.
You've been wonderful for the Tropicana.
We have a fine personal relationship Yes?
I can't stand in your way, my boy.
Take one of those other offers.
Onward and upward and you'll get to the top of the heap.
But Mr. Littlefield, you don't understand.
If you don't give Ricky that raise you'll lose him, he'll quit.
I understand perfectly.
Oh, you do?
We'll give him one more chance, dear.
Uh Mr. Littlefield are you sure you don't want to change your mind and snap him up before it's too late?
No.
No?
No!
N-O.
All right, I quit.
K-W-I-T!
All right.
All right!
And don't think you're going to get my recipe for cheesecake, either!
What?
Lucy, what's the meaning of this?
What?
This ad in the paper says that Xavier Valdez and his orchestra are opening at the Tropicana Club Thursday night.
Isn't Ricky there anymore?
No, thanks to a certain big-mouth redhead.
What are you talking about?
Well, the other night Ricky told Mr. Littlefield that he had to have a raise or he'd quit and I egged him onto it.
And?
That was some of the rottenest egging I ever did.
Oh, Lucy, how's Ricky taking it?
Just terrible- he's done nothing but mope around the house for two days- won't even get out of his pajamas.
Hi, Ethel.
Oh, hi, Ricky.
I'll get your breakfast.
No, no, thank you, thank you.
I want to get downtown.
Oh, that's the spirit, Ricky.
Don't let this get you down- get out and fight.
You'll be bringing home a check again any day now.
That's right; I'm on my way to the unemployment office right now.
Well, how does it feel to be married to an also-been?
An "also-been"?
He means a has-ran.
Gee, it's pitiful, Ethel.
I got to do something about getting his job back.
Well, maybe this Xavier Valdez won't work out and Mr. Littlefield will be forced to ask Ricky to come back again.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if nobody showed up for Xavier's opening?
It would take a miracle, though.
Yeah Wait a minute!
What?
I feel a miracle coming on!
What do you mean?
Listen, there are 75 tables at the Tropicana.
What if I called as 75 different people and made 75 reservations and then at the last minute got 75 headaches and couldn't make it?
Hey, that might work out.
Sure, the place would be empty.
I'm going to call the Tropicana right now.
Tropicana Club.
: Hello, this is Mrs. Worthington Proudfoot.
I'd like to make a reservation for Thursday evening.
Oh, fine, Mrs. Proudfoot.
You are our first reservation.
Oh, how charming.
Charming, yes.
I'd like a table for eight, please.
Yes Yes, you're welcome.
It worked!
Who'll I be now?
Say, listen, Ethel, why don't you go down and make reservations on your phone?
That way we'll tie up the line and nobody else will be able to get a table.
That's a good idea.
Okay, I think I'll be a celebrity this time.
I'll check with you later.
Okay, honey.
: Hello, Tropicana, darling?
I'd like a reservation for Thursday, darling.
Yes, I'd like one of those darling little tables underneath those darling little palm trees, darling.
Yes, good-bye.
Hello, Tropicana.
Yes, we have a nice table for two.
De la chopa.
Thank you.
Hello, Tropicana.
Yes, Mrs. Thompson.
J- just one minute, please.
Hello, Mrs. Bennett?
Y- yes, would you hold for a second, please?
Yes, Mrs. Thompson.
All right, Mrs. Bennett, all right, all right.
That's right, that's four at 8:00.
Eight at 10:00.
Ten at Oh sorry I'm very sorry.
I'm very sorry No, I didn't mean you.
Mrs., uh, Mrs., uh Oh!
Mon dieu!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
We'd be delighted to see you.
Good-bye.
Well, how's everything going, Maurice?
It's amazing, Mr. Littlefield.
We opened the book for reservations two hours ago and we are completely, completely sold out.
Splendid, splendid.
I cannot understand it.
This is the first time this has happened in the history of the club.
It's quite clear to me: I finally hired someone with talent.
Hello, Tropicana Club.
No, I'm very, very sorry, we are all booked up we are completely sold out.
: Yes, yes.
But it's impossible, madame, that's impossible.
: Oh, well, are you sure that you don't have just one little table for Scarlet Culpepper?
Oh, well, I am sorry.
Is that so?
Well, I declare.
Well, bye now.
Whew!
Oh, brother I can't make one more phone call.
My finger's all worn down to a nub.
You won't have to, they're all sold out.
Good.
Harry and Bess Truman got the last table.
Hey, this'll make Ricky look pretty good, huh, Fred?
Well, I don't know if it will make Ricky look good but it will certainly make the other guy look bad.
Hey, that's right, Ethel.
We have to make Mr. Littlefield realize that those people aren't showing up because Ricky Ricardo isn't there.
Oh, yeah.
How?
Gee, I don't know.
I guess we'll just have to go in and sit down at the table and then everybody get up and walk out when we find out Ricky isn't playing there.
Oh, no, we'd be recognized.
Well, not necessarily.
Depends on how we're fixed up.
Sure, we could all be disguised.
Yeah.
But, Lucy, one table of people walking out isn't going to mean anything.
Well, maybe we could go out and come back a couple of times or something.
How?
Well Wait a minute.
What?
I got a pal that's a quick-change artist.
Hal King!
Yeah, and I'll bet he'd let us borrow all his trick wardrobe.
Well, call him up!
What are you waiting for?
Come on!
Well everything all set?
Yes, sir, everything is fine.
Ah, wonderful, wonderful.
In a few moments, this room will be filled with 300 jolly, fun-seeking, money-spending revelers.
Psst, psst, they're beginning to arrive.
Good evening.
Do you have a reservation?

You know, my dear, you're going to be very impressed with this chap Ricky Ricardo.
Very remarkable chap, Ricky Ricardo.
Oh, I'm sorry, madame.
What about?
Uh, Ricky Yes, Ricky Ricardo is not here anymore.
Oh, but we have that world-famous entertainer Xavier Valdez.
No Ricky Ricardo?
!
But we only came here to hear Ricky Ricardo.
Certainement.
If the Ricardo chap isn't here, we may as well pop off.
Indeed.
Um, um  Oh, please, please, wait.
You'll enjoy Xavier Valdez.
He's a lot more clever than Ricky Ricardo.
Please!
Really no one is more clever than Ricky Ricardo, peasant.
Where is everybody?

Well, I don't know.
There was that one group over there but they walked out.
Yes, yes, I know, I know.

This is my favorite club.
You always put on a good show here.
I always say that.
I always tell everybody that.
You should hear me.
I always say, "You never get let down if you go and see Ricky Ricardo.
" That's what I always say.
But, uh, Ricky Ricardo is not here anymore.
Ricky Ricardo ain't here no more?
!
Well, I'm getting out of this crummy dump.
Oh, but if you please Please, save your breath.
I beg your pardon.
Did I hear you say that Ricky Ricardo isn't here anymore?
Yeah, how do you like that?
Well, I don't like it at all.
Oh, please, please, please I assure you if you stay you won't be disappointed.
Ha!
My good man, is Ricky Ricardo appearing here tonight or not?
Well no.
That's all.
Let me use your telephone.
Please, Mrs. Chumley, no, if you just Say, buster, who's the stupe that let Ricky Ricardo slip through his fingers?
You?
Well yes.
Oh, brother.
Hello, Mary, this is Miriam.
I just called to tell you not to bother to come to the Tropicana Club tonight.
Ricky Ricardo isn't appearing here anymore.
Yes, I knew you'd want to know.
Oh, no, no, please.
Cancel Mrs. Ackerman's reservation.
But Mrs. Ackerman has a reservation for 30 people!
I know.
That a girl, Crumley.
Here we go, up and at 'em.
Oh, but ladies, ladies You're jolly well stupid, you know.
Now, do not worry, Mr. Littlefield.
After all, they looked rather strange.
Maybe they did look strange but they were paying customers.
Hello.
Ah Oh Oh, it's you.
What's the matter, Alvin?
Well, where is everybody?
They're all out washing their hands.
Isn't this opening night?
Aren't you sold out?
What happened?
Oh, please, please stop asking so many questions, Phoebe.
Here, sit down.
Pretend you're enjoying yourself.
Hmm?
Well, at least smile.
Ohh Uh good evening.
Do you have a reservation?
: Oh, of course we have a reservation.
Don't we have a reservation?
Oh, dear!
Hazel, look!
Oh Countess Blueblichki Ricky Ricardo isn't playing here tonight.
: Ricky Ricardo is not here anymore?
Well, Mr. Ricardo finished his engagement here.
Well, where is he playing?
We'll go there.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, that does it.
Maurice, get Ricky Ricardo on the phone.
If I don't get him back, I'll go bankrupt!
That's a very smart move, my man.
Yes, yes.
When you get Ricky Ricardo back here we'll be back again.
Good-bye.
Come, girls.
Gee, I wish Ricky would come home or phone or something.
Didn't his note say he'd phone?
No, it just says it says "Mr. Littlefield called and wanted to talk to me.
I think he wants to hire me back.
" Oh, hiya, folks!
FRED and  Hi, Ricky.
Hi, honey.
How's everybody?
We got your note.
What happened?
Oh, Lucy, you should have seen what happened.
No kidding.
Let's see, I went down to the Tropicana and there wasn't one single solitary soul in the place.
No?
And not only that, but Maurice told me that the few people that came in as soon as they found out that I wasn't there out they went.
Fantastic.
My goodness.
Boy!
Well, I guess I didn't realize how popular I am.
What did Mr. Littlefield say?
Does he want you back?
Does he want me back?
I'll say he does.
He offered me twice as much money as I was getting before.
Really?
When do you start?
I dun't.
You "dun't"?
What do you mean?
Well, why should I work for him?
If I'm that popular I can write my own ticket anyplace in town!
No!
