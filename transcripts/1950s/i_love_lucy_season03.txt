{START OF EPISODE 1}
Did you have a nice time shopping with Mama and Aunt Ethel?
You were such a good boy.
Now we're going to get our coat off and we're going to have a big dinner and you can sit here and play while Mama changes her clothes.
Will you be a good boy?
There you are, tanny right up there.
That's a fella.
Tanny right up there, we take the coat off.
Him was such a good boy.
You tired, baby?
Little baby tired?
Tanny up tanny up, Ricky.
There we go.
Let go.
That's it.
Now, you play, play.
There you go, honey.
I'll be right back.
Give me mine.
Oh, wasn't that a wonderful break we went by Hansen's during their selling-out sale?
Uh-huh.
I wonder why she's giving up that dress shop.
Oh, I don't know, but I'm glad she is.
Oh, did you ever see such a bargain?
Never.
And Ricky thinks I don't know how to save money.
Why, I saved $10 on this dress alone.
I saved seven on mine.
That's $17 we saved today.
What'll we spend it on?
How about buying hats?
Oh, wonderful- they actually won't cost us a cent.
Gee, won't our husbands be proud of us?
Yeah.
Let's wear these dresses tonight and show 'em, huh?
Oh, no, I won't get to wear mine for a couple of months yet.
What do you mean you won't get to wear yours for a couple of months yet?
I have a system.
You know how mad Ricky gets at me when I buy a new dress?
Yeah.
Well, I just hang this away in the closet for a couple of months and then I take it out and wear it and Ricky says, "Is that a new dress"?
And I say, "No, it's been hanging in the closet for months.
" Oh, you're the sneaky one.
Yeah.
See you later.
Bye-bye.
Yes, sir, and do you know how many steps he took yesterday?
Six?
No.
Seven?
No, two.
No kidding.
Oh, really?
Honestly- I got so excited that I called Ricky down at the club, didn't I, dear?
Huh?
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
There is, too.
Ever since you came home, you've been sitting there in a Cuban funk.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's this crazy business that I'm in that's getting me down.
There's no sense to show business.
He gets like this every once in a while.
What's the matter, dear?
Did you have a tough day?
Every day is a tough day.
Everybody wants more money, everybody wants better billing.
You have to put up with all these crazy, temperamental people.
If there's one thing that I can't stand, it's temperamental people yelling and screaming all the time!
Why do they have to yell and scream?
!
Why can't they do business in a normal, sensible manner like I do?
!
Well, I don't know, dear.
Perhaps it's because they're not calm and even-tempered like you are.
Yeah.
Well, the whole thing is not worth it.
I mean, it's not worth it.
When you are through, you've got nothing.
Nothing.
You got nothing going for you.
What have I got going for me?
Nothing.
I got nothing going for me.
Oh, you have, too, Ricky.
You're a big, important star.
Sure.
Certainly.
Well, I mean, show business is not like any other business.
You know, in another business, if you get sick, let's say maybe you own a store, people working for you.
It takes care of itself, you don't have to worry.
You get sick, you stay home, you enjoy being sick.
You're the smart one, Fred.
Fred?
!
Fred?
!
Me?
!
Sure!
You saved your money and you bought this building.
Well, that's true.
Now all you got to do is just sit back and watch the money roll in.
All right, so it's not a million dollars, but you got security.
That's what I ought to do.
I ought to get myself a little business.
That's a wonderful idea, Ricky.
Hey, we've got a couple of bucks saved up.
Maybe we could go in partners with them.
Yeah!
Really?
What kind of business did you have in mind?
Well, gee, I don't know I do- Hansen's Dress Shop.
Yes!
It's for sale.
You know that little store in the middle of the next block?
It's a gold mine right here in our own neighborhood.
Now, now, wait a minute, Lucy.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Well, but Ricky, a dress shop is just the thing for you.
Look, I already own a dress shop.
What do you mean you already own a dress shop?
Have you looked in your closet lately?
Oh, now don't be smart.
I don't have a lot of clothes.
Huh?
All right, so I do have a lot of clothes, but where did I buy them all?
From Hansen's.
Me, too.
In fact, I bought a dress there just this morning.
So did lots of people.
Ethel, did you buy another dress?
Yes, at Hansen's.
That's where I've bought all my dresses ever since we've been married.
All three of them.
Ethel Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let's not get off the subject.
The point is that that dress shop would be a good investment for us.
Look, that might be fine and all of that.
The dress shop might be great, but it's out of the question.
Fred and I don't know anything about running a dress shop.
You don't have to run it, Ethel and I will.
Yes!
You and Ethel Yeah.
Oh, no!
Well, I don't see what's so funny.
Women have good business brains, too.
I saved $7 on that dress I bought this morning.
And I saved $10.
What did you say?
Uh, never mind, just keep on laughing at us.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
"Let's run a business"!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha ha?
Oh, honestly, Ethel, doesn't it make you sick that those husbands of ours can't see an opportunity like this?
I don't even want to think about it.
Honest to goodness, such a darling shop.
Hello, Mrs. Hansen.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo and Mrs. Mertz, how are you?
Hello.
Fine, but Ricky said I had to bring this dress back.
Well, that's all right.
Well, seeing it was on sale and everything, won't it foul up your bookkeeping?
Oh, not at all, Mrs. Ricardo.
You see, I never charge up my sales to you until at least a week after.
Oh.
That's nice.
We're sure going to miss you when you sell this store.
Yeah, we wanted to buy it ourselves, but our husbands wouldn't let us.
No.
Men have no business sense.
No.
You know, I'd like to buy it anyway just to prove that they don't know what they're talking about.
You know, that would be wonderful.
And it would practically pay for itself in no time.
Oh, no, no, it's out of the question.
It's too much money.
You're probably asking thousands of dollars for it.
Now, you'd be surprised how cheap it is.
I have a tremendous stock and a long lease and all I'm asking is $3,000.
$3,000?
Is that all?
That's all.
Uh, you'll excuse me just a moment.
Oh, Ethel, I can't stand it.
We can't let this opportunity go by.
Do you have an idea?
Yes, how much money have you got?
You always get that same idea.
Never mind, how much have you got?
It doesn't matter, $3,000 is out of the question for us.
Now, listen, that's just her asking price.
I'll bet I could get her down to $1,500.
I'll bet you couldn't.
I'll bet I could.
Bet.
Now, where were we?
Oh, yes, I was telling you the price, wasn't I?
Well, frankly, Mrs. Hansen $3,000, that's just too much money.
Uh I'm sure that was just your asking price.
You'd go a little lower, wouldn't you?
I'm sorry.
Just a little bit lower?
No.
Not a penny?
No.
Ha, ha, ha!
What's so funny?
I was going to offer you $1,500.
$1,500.
I'll take it.
Uh, just a moment, please.
Some customers.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Hansen.
Good afternoon.
This is that marvelous shop I was telling you about, Grace.
Just wait till you see the goodies.
Oh, I can hardly wait.
Oh, Mrs. Hansen, I'll take that divine striped dress you put away for me yesterday.
Fine.
Just imagine, Grace, And look at this cute little sweater.
How much is it?
$49.50.
I'll take it.
How much is this sweater?
$20.
I'll take these two.
FIRST  I'll take two myself.
May I try the dress on?
Why, of course, right this way.
Come on, Grace.
Ethel, do you realize, she just took in $200?
I know.
Listen, we've just got to get this place.
This is a gold mine.
Oh, but we don't even have the down payment.
Now, look, Mrs. Hansen just made $200 in five minutes.
That's $2,400 an hour.
The store is open eight hours a day Do you realize we'll be making $19,000 a day?
Wow!
Mrs. Hansen!
Mrs. Hansen, we'll take the store.
Oh!
All right.
If only I had time to hold out for a fair price.
Fair!
But I cannot stay here.
Mother needs me.
Your mother!
Yes she's in the hospital and that $1,500 will just about pay for her operation.
Oh, well, Mrs. Hansen, we don't want to take advantage of you.
Oh, well, let's make it $1,750.
Oh, bless you.
The difference in the money will just about pay the repairs on the car.
The repairs on the car?
Yes, grandma had a wreck when she was taking mother to the hospital.
Oh, dear.
Oh, Lucy, let's make it 2,000.
No, let's make it 2,250.
Oh, thank you, thank you!
Now, you mustn't think any more about money.
I'll get the house rebuilt somehow.
The house!
It's a shambles since the fire.
Oh, dear, well, look, I- I-I can't have this hanging on my conscience.
Now, look, Mrs. Hansen, you thought $3,000 was a fair price and that's what we'll pay you.
We'll get it back in no time at all.
Oh, you're the dearest, sweetest girls in all the world, and how do you want to handle the down payment?
Uh, well, uh what did you have in mind?
Money.
I mean, I've heard that 10% is usual.
That's $300.
Uh, would you, uh, take a check that's postdated a couple of days?
Well, I don't know Well, you see, I have to transfer some of my assets in my other accounts.
Well, I guess that would be all right.
Good, I'll bring you a check this afternoon.
Partner?
Partner.
Saks Fifth Avenue, look out!
I think I'll take this adorable belt, too.
Never mind, they've gone.
Oh.
Deal set?
All set.
You were just fine, and you can each have a scarf for helping me out.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, hi, I'm sorry I'm late.
I had to wait for Ricky to leave before I could take the baby down to Mrs. Trumbull.
How many sales did you make?
None.
None!
We've been open for an hour and a half.
So?
So we've already lost $3,600.
Oh, Lucy, you can't expect to make $200 every five minutes.
Sometimes it'll be more, sometimes it'll be less.
Wait till the rush starts, then we'll make it up.
Yeah, well, I guess you're right.
Hey, you know, we ought to call all our friends and tell them that we bought this place.
Yeah.
Say, we're not going to keep on calling it Hansen's, are we?
Oh, no, I guess not.
What do you want to call it?
Oh, you think of a name.
Doesn't make any difference to me.
No, it doesn't matter to me either.
Well, then, I think it ought to be a combination of both our names, like "Ethelu's.
" "Ethelu's"?
Well, that doesn't sound very good.
Why not?
Well, it just doesn't have an easy flow, a nice, pleasing sound.
Well, what would you suggest?
Well, something that rolls right off your tongue like "Lucyeth's.
" "Lucyeth's"?
Well, that rolls right off your tongue, all right.
You couldn't keep it on your tongue if you tried.
Well, maybe we shouldn't try to be too cute.
Just use both our names and that's all.
Okay.
Well, it's settled, then: "Lucy and Ethel's Dress Shop.
" "Lucy and Ethel's Dress Shop"?
Yeah.
Well, I think there ought to be a slight change.
What kind of a change?
Well, like "Ethel and Lucy's Dress Shop.
" Why would you make a change like that?
Well, just because I think "Ethel and Lucy's Dress Shop" sounds better to the ear.
Not to my ear it doesn't.
Well, you've got a tin ear.
Well, you're a big ham.
Who's a big ham?
You are, you've always got to have your name first.
You're the one Ethel, Lucy, Ethel, Lucy,  This is a pretty pickle.
We've been open two whole days and haven't seen a customer.
We've made five sales.
Yes, to each other.
And I think we should have investigated our credit before we opened those charge accounts.
Hey, there's Ricky and Fred.
Look.
Where?
Oh!
I just don't get it.
Oh, isn't that a really darling Oh, hi!
Oh, hi.
Don't worry, we didn't buy anything.
We're on our way home from the drugstore.
Do you want to go home with us?
No, we got to do a little more shopping.
All right, see you later.
Okay.
Bye, honey.
You know, I don't understand it.
How can a guy be flat on his back three times and still get up and win?
Maybe he had a sore back.
Where is everybody?
I don't know.
Maybe the whole town's been evacuated, and they forgot to tell us.
What time is it, anyway?
It's 3:00.
Here comes somebody- pretend you're a customer.
Now, this is a lovely dress.
Oh, that's just darling.
Does it come in any other colors?
Well, uh Oh, never mind, Ethel, it's Mrs. Hansen.
Hello, Mrs. Hansen.
Mrs. Ricardo, your check bounced.
My check bounced!
Like a rubber ball.
Well!
I'll call that bank and give them a piece of my mind.
I've already called them.
Oh, you have?
Uh, look, Mrs. Hansen, now, you know who my husband is.
Now, there's no question about that check being good.
Then you won't mind if I call and ask him.
Uh, no, go right ahead.
Oh, but you won't be able to use our phone- it's out of order, isn't it, Ethel?
Huh?
Oh, yes, it's out of order.
Hello, hello?
Dead as a doornail.
I'll call him from the drugstore.
Oh, Lucy, what are you going to do?
Get my coat and purse.
Hello?
Hello, Ricky?
Ricky, this is Lucy.
How are you, dear?
Fine.
Where are you?
I'm downtown.
Uh oh, listen, honey, hang on a minute- don't hang up.
Where are you going?
I'm going home.
Home?
Yeah, and don't hang up this phone for five minutes.
Hi, dear.
What kept you so long?
Well, I got here as soon as I could.
Well, what do you want?
Well, hang up and I'll tell you.
Okay, good-bye.
What are you doing?
Uh well, I was so close I thought I might as well come on home.
Oh well, what do you want, honey?
Uh, well, I I was worrying about Little Ricky- how is he?
He's fine.
He's been fine all day.
Uh, are you sure?
I think I hear him crying.
I don't hear anything.
Oh, you'd better go see, dear.
All right, I'll go see.
Hello, Ricardos' residence, this is the maid speaking.
Mr. Ricardo?
Yes, he's here, but he doesn't speak any English.
You don't speak Spanish, do you?
Oh, you do.
Oh, well, just a moment.
He's fine, honey, he wasn't crying.
Is the call for me?
Uh yeah.
Yeah, it's one of my girlfriends and she's trying to help her daughter with some Spanish for school, and she thought maybe you could help her out.
Sure, what does she want to know how to say?
Uh "The check is good.
" "The check is good"?
Uh-huh.
That's a funny thing for a kid to know how to say.
Well, it's probably one of those sentences that they have to write out- you know, like "Do you have an umbrella"?
"Do you have a match"?
"The check is good.
" Oh.
You know, like that.
"The check is good.
" "El cheque esta bueno.
" Thank you.
That's all you wanted to know, wasn't it?
Thank you, good-bye.
Esta bueno cheque.
No, no, no, el cheque esta bueno.
Esta esta check e beno, bueno.
El cheque esta bueno.
Esta bueno, esta bueno.
El cheque esta bueno Yeah, that's a very cute way of saying it.
Oh, boy, I got out of that one.
Lucy, while you were gone a man called up- a Mr. Ralph S. Boyer.
What did he want?
Did he want to buy something?
Yes.
What, a dress?
No, he's interested in buying the store.
Buying the store!
Yes, he's on his way over here now.
Oh, wonderful.
We'll use the same gag on him that Mrs. Hansen used on us.
You know, about her grandmother that's been in a terrible accident.
Only this time we won't just talk about the grandmother.
What do you mean?
You just stall him off.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Here, wait a minute, Grandma, let me help you.
I'm going that way.
I'm going down there.
Oh, you're going this way.
You must have had a you must have had a a terrible accident.
Oh, it was awful.
Yes, it was a terrible thing.
I got all smashed up.
Somebody came at me from behind.
I'm going right here.
This is where I'm going.
Well, this shop is closed.
How's that?
This shop is closed.
Closed?
There's a note on the door here.
What does it say?
It says, "Lucy, I've gone to Mr. Boyer's bank with him to close the deal- Ethel.
" Oh, for heaven's sake, what's the matter with her?
Is she crazy or something?
She doesn't know how to take care of a deal.
Oh, I could kill her.
She can't add two and two.
What does she know about making deals?
For heaven's sakes, oh Ethel!
Lucy!
Come here and help me get this off.
Help you get Oh, all right.
Now, where have you been?
Lucy, you've got to come down to the bank and sign the papers.
I'm not going anyplace till I find out what this is all about.
He gave us $3,500.
I don't $3,500!
Yippee!
Oh, this is wonderful!
That's $500 for us.
Oh, and our husbands think we don't know anything about business.
Oh, be my guest, I'll drive you to the bank.
Okay.
And that's for you, and that's for me.
That's 250 for you and 250 for me.
I'm just going to wave it at them when they come in.
Oh, I can't wait to see their faces when we show it to them.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!
What a deal this could have been.
Yeah, two prize idiots.
Okay, Rick, you kick me and then I'll kick you.
What are you talking about?
What's the matter?
Well, you know that dress shop that you wanted us to buy?
Yeah?
Somebody just bought it in a deal.
How did you know about it?
Right here in the papers.
In the papers?
Really?
You know, it seems that they wanted to build a skyscraper in that block, and the only thing that was holding the deal up was the lease on that shop.
So a fellow by the name of Boyer bought it and sold it to the construction company for $50,000.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Bye-bye.
Say bye-bye.
Bye.
He's going to take his nap.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Isn't he just growing?
I tell you, he's the image of his father.
He's my godson, you know.
Just darling  Well, let's get on with the meeting.
We have to wait for Lucy?
Well, she's the president.
Well, I'm the co-president.
I'll take over even though it isn't my turn.
Then we won't waste any time, huh?
Yeah.
All right.
Well, did I miss anything?
Next thing on the agenda is Uh, I'll take over now, Ethel.
It's my turn to be president.
Hey, that's doing pretty good, isn't it?
That's great.
Girls, girls.
The meeting will come to order.
Now, I would like to talk about the club's yearly show.
I think we should schedule it for sometime next week.
Next week?
But it's so close to the bazaar.
But it's only three months since we had our last yearly show.
Yes, I know.
Now, if you'll all be quiet I'll have Caroline tell you the wonderful reason- Caroline?
Well, as you all know, my husband is the manager of a television station, and last night we were talking, and he just happened to mention that there was one half hour of time that they hadn't been able to sell.
So I said to him, "Charlie, how about letting our women's club put on a show during that half hour"?
And he said well, never mind what he said.
Well, anyway, after I talked to him for a while, he finally agreed that our club can have the time.
Girls, girls, girls, let's be businesslike about this now.
What time did he agree to give us, Caroline?
Uh, next Monday from 12:00 to 12:30.
Oh, that's fine time.
That's right in the middle of the day when everybody's home.
Yeah, well, everybody's home, all right, but it's not the middle of the day.
It's 12:00 midnight.
Midnight!
Oh, well, now, look- what difference does it make?
We have a whole half hour on television.
Now, the important thing is to select the chairman, someone to be in charge of the whole program.
Now, it's very important that we select someone who has a lot of talent, who makes a good appearance, someone who is in show business or at least close to it by having a husband, or someone like that, you know, who is in it.
You all agree with me, don't you?
Well, then the chair will have nominations for that important post.
The chair recognizes Marian Strong.
You're absolutely right, Madam Chairman.
That's just the kind of a person we need.
Well, it's the only logical way.
Now, as you all know, there is only one of us here who is really close to the theater.
I spent a number of years as an actress brilliantly climaxing my career by being mistress of ceremonies at the Senior Shenanigans of the Rappahannock School For Girls.
Need I say more?
Well, you certainly need not.
I didn't know you were professional.
Madam Co-President, uh, at this point, may I ask you to take over?
Why?
Well, it's not fair for me to be president at this moment.
For what I have to say, I'd rather be a civilian.
Now, do I hear any more nominations for chairman of our show?
Lucy Ricardo.
Well, uh, dramatic experience is fine, but will the general public know who Marian Strong is?
Well, you can tell them at the beginning of the program, you know.
The program would be over before we could say "Senior Shenanigans of the Rappahannock School For Girls.
" It would not!
Oh, girls.
Oh, it certainly would.
Girls!
You can't say Girls!
"school for girls" without your tongue getting twisted.
Lucy Lucy, you have the floor.
Thank you very much.
Therefore, I think that I should be the chairman.
Who knows who you are?
Nobody, and you hit it right on the head.
What we need is a star name, and if I am chosen chairman I will guarantee to get Ricky Ricardo as master of ceremonies.
Oh, Lucy, are you sure you could get Ricky?
Oh, well, girls, girls, in that case, I'm sure that Marian will be the first to agree that Lucy should be in charge.
Of course.
Now, all those in favor of making Lucy Ricardo chairman of our yearly show on television, say "aye.
" SEVERAL  Aye.
The "ayes" have it.
Meeting adjourned, let's eat.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Ethel, will you help me?
Don't forget the punchbowl.
Oh, Lucy, imagine us being on television.
Isn't it wonderful?
Oh, boy.
And with Ricky as master of ceremonies.
Good night.
Hey, what made him change his mind?
I thought he said he never would be in another women's club production.
He did.
Well, then, how come he agreed to be in this one?
He didn't yet.
Oh, Lucy, you just said you could get Ricky so you'd get to be the chairman.
Oh, what a sneaky thing to do.
If I am the chairman the best parts in the show are certain to go to you and me.
Oh, yeah.
Doesn't seem so sneaky now, does it?
Well  Come in.
Hi.
Hi, Fred.
Is this week's meeting of the claw and cackle club over?
Never mind that now, Fred.
We're going to be on television.
Who is?
Our women's club.
Well, That ought to bring back movies.
No kidding, Fred.
Caroline Appleby's husband said that we could have a whole half hour on his TV station next Monday night.
Oh, do you need any good talent?
What kind of a show are you going to put on?
Uh A cooking show.
A panel show.
Oh, I get it.
Well, if you don't want me on your show, I won't be in it.
Okay.
Okay.
On the other hand, you're entitled to a to a little peek at the kind of talent you're turning down.
Now, listen, Fred, Ricky's going to be the only man in it.
All the rest are members of our women's club.
When the red, red robin comes a-bob bob bobbin' along, along We should know better than to tell him.
There'll be no more sobbin' When he starts robbin' his own sweet song Wake up, wake up, wake up, you sleepy head Okay, Fred.
All right, Fred.
Get up, come on, come on, get out of bed Cheer up, cheer up Okay, you can be in it.
Cheer up, the sun is red Fred, she said you can be in it.
Live, love, laugh and be happy What if I were blue I'll be walking through a field of flowers The rain will glisten, and I will listen  For hours and hours.
Oh, I'm just a kid again, doing what I did again Singing a song When the red, red robin  When the red, red robin Comes bob, bob, bobbin' along He's still at it.
Come on, Ethel.
Let's figure out the routine for the show.
Okay.
What'll we start with?
Well, Luann Hall will want to play the piano.
Yeah.
And Jane Sebastian will want to do her birdcalls.
Yeah.
She's all right.
I suppose Caroline will want to do her impersonation of Bette Davis.
That isn't Bette Davis she impersonates.
It's Lionel Barrymore.
It is?
Say you don't think we could get along without Caroline, do you?
Her husband manages the station.
Who follows Caroline?
Rosalyn McKee will want to recite "Trees.
" Oh, she does that so beautifully.
Yeah, she does, she really does.
Let's see now, Ricky can sing a couple of numbers and then I'll do the big closing number and that's it.
I don't think I've left out anyone, have I?
Can you think of anyone el?
Oh, dear.
Well, thank you.
Oh, well, come now, dear.
We'll find a spot for you someplace.
Let's see here, Luann, Jane, Caroline.
Well, you can't do the closing number.
Why?
'Cause I'm doing it.
Why?
Well, I'm the president.
Well, I'm the co-president.
Well, I'm the chairman.
Well, I'm the one who knows how you got to be chairman.
Well!
Oh, come on, now, Lucy, seeing as we're co-presidents, why don't we do a duet?
A duet?
Yeah, something like, uh that Cole Porter song, "Friendship.
" Isn't that a wonderful idea?
Well, no.
That way I don't get to sing alone.
That's what makes it a wonderful idea.
Now, cut it out, Ethel.
"Friendship"?
Uh-huh.
"Friendship," let's see, is that the one that goes  : If you're ever up a tree Call on me.
That's it.
Is that it?
Yeah, that's a wonderful number.
Listen, let's get some sheet music and rehearse it.
Okay.
Here, help me move this table.
Where are you gonna put it?
Play with your toys, honey.
Lucy?
Yeah, I'm here, Ethel.
Hi, honey.
Ricky isn't home yet, huh?
No, not yet.
Lucy, I've been worrying.
About what?
Well, what if you can't talk him into emceeing the show?
Don't worry, I've got my strategy all planned.
What are you going to do, wheedle him?
No, I've done that so much my wheedle is all worn out.
And I'm not going to be lovey dovey or cry or pout either.
What's left?
I'm going to use my head.
What are you going to do, beat him with it?
No, I'm going to make Ricky ask to be in that show.
How?
Hypnotize him?
No, when Ricky comes home, you and I are going to be talking about the show, and we'll be discussing who we're going to get to emcee.
You watch, Ricky won't be able to stand it.
We won't even mention him.
Oh, I don't know.
Well, I do.
Listen, Ethel, next to sugar, Cuba's biggest export is ham.
Honey, I'm home.
There it is.
Okay, dear, I'll be right there.
Now, Ethel, you remember, you follow my lead.
We won't even mention Ricky.
We'll consider everyone but him.
Okay.
Hi, dear.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Hello, Ricky.
Hi, honey.
Hi, honey.
Guess what happened at the club meeting today.
I know I shouldn't ask, but what?
Well, Caroline Appleby's husband said that we could have one whole half hour on his TV station next Monday night.
We're going to put on a review.
Yes?
And we were waiting for you to come home because we wanted to ask you a very important question.
Yes?
Should we wear formals?
Should you wear formals?
Yeah, Ethel and I have got a number to do together, and we don't know whether to wear costumes or formals.
Oh, let's wear formals.
It'll give me an excuse to buy a new one.
Okay.
Formals it is.
Thanks anyway, Ricky.
Didn't need you after all.
Come on, Ethel.
Oh, say, wait a minute: what about the emcee?
Yeah, what about the emcee?
Well, you see, we need a master of ceremonies and it'd be great if it was someone really wonderful, you know.
Gee, I can't think of a soul.
Can you think of anybody, Ethel?
Well, it'll be a great opportunity for someone to be seen on television.
Sure will.
He'll be in front of the cameras most of the time.
That's right.
Should be someone who makes a good appearance.
A dark, handsome type.
It'd be great if he could play a musical instrument and sing a song.
Yeah.
Let's see now, a dark, handsome type, plays a musical instrument and sings a song.
Well, there's only one person to ask.
Dan Jenkins.
Dan Jenkins?
Yeah, what's the matter with him?
Well, it's none of my business, but this fella doesn't even have a voice.
Well, he plays a musical instrument.
Sure, tissue paper and comb.
Well, if that's what you want, it's okay with me.
Oh, well, honey, it isn't what we want.
We don't want Dan Jenkins.
But, uh, you know we'd like to have somebody like, uh Well, somebody great but we don't know anybody like that, so what are we going to do?
Well, uh you haven't asked me.
You?
Why, you said you'd never be in another one of our shows.
Oh, I don't know.
I might be available if I was approached correctly.
Oh, honey, now don't kid us about this.
This is serious.
You're being mean.
No, I'm not.
I'm not kidding.
I'm serious.
I'll do it.
Really?
What made you change your mind?
I don't know, I just feel like it.
And that should teach you a lesson.
What should?
Well, you know, I can always tell when you're trying to make me do something, when you, you know, when you trick me into it.
Oh?
And I'll never do it when you're trying to make me do it.
No.
But this is different, as you know.
Here you were in a spot, and, uh you respected my wishes about not being in the show.
You didn't even ask.
No.
So I'm going to be big about it and I'll help you out.
Oh, honey, you're wonderful.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Now you see how much farther you get by just being honest?
Yes, dear, I've learned my lesson.
That's a good girl.
Ricky, we've been rehearsing our number and we want to do it with a piano.
Will you play for us?
Sure.
Well, I've got to have a ringside seat for this.
Honey, help me move this down there.
All right.
Push it up toward the couch.
Okay.
Now you stand over there and we'll make an entrance like this.
Right there?
Yeah.
Ricky, give us a-one, a-two.
Are you ready?
Uh-huh.
All right.
One, two.
If you're ever in a jam, here I am.
If you're ever in a mess, S.O.S. If you ever get so happy, you land in jail I'm your bail.
It's friendship, friendship, just the perfect blendship.
When other friendships have been forgot Ours will still be hot.
A da-da-da-da da-da dig-dig-dig Isn't that funny?
If you're ever up a tree A- phone to me.
If you're ever down a well Ring my bell.
Okay.
If you ever lose your dough When you're out to dine, borrow mine.
It's friendship, friendship, just the perfect blendship.
When other friendships have been forgate Ours will still be great.
A la-da-la-da la-da chuck-chuck-chuck A la-da-la-da la-da chuck-chuck-chuck.
If they ever a-black your eye A- put me wise.
If they ever cook your goose Turn me loose.
If they ever put a bullet Right through your brain, I'll complain.
It's friendship, friendship, just the perfect blendship.
When other friendships have been forgit Ours will still be it A la-da-la-da la-da hep-hep-hep Two, three.
A da-da-da-da da-da hep-hep-hep Two, three.
A da-da-da-da da-da hep-hep-hep!
Ooh.
Did you like it?
Well, it's a little bit on the corny side, but I think it'll go, yeah.
What'd you think, Fred?
Well, it may even be worth all the money you spent on your new dress.
Oh, Ethel, you didn't tell me.
When did you get it?
Yesterday afternoon.
I got mine today.
Go get yours and I'll show you mine.
Okay.
Oh, what a pair, eh?
La-la la-la la-la la-la  Hep-hep-hep.
Oh, they're demons all right.
I want you to see this.
I think this is the most beautiful dress I never thought I'd own a dress like this in my whole life.
When I saw it there, I just couldn't stand it.
And I had such a wonderful opportunity to buy it and everything.
I can only hope I'm looking in a mirror.
Well, I'm sorry to say you're not.
Where did you get yours?
At Macy's.
Where did you get yours?
Gimbel's.
Imagine us getting the same dress at two different stores.
Yeah, it sure is a funny coincidence.
Sure is.
Well, it's very amusing, but what are we going to do about it?
Oh, well, there's only one thing to do.
One of us will have to take her dress back.
Yeah, one of us will have to.
Why take either one of them back?
Yeah, I think it's kind of cute.
You know you can do like a sister act.
Yeah.
Oh, for heaven's sake, you don't think we're going to go out there and do that number in the same dress, do you?
Good grief, no.
Well, I'll make the sacrifice, Ethel.
I'll take mine back and get something else.
Oh, no, I'll take mine back.
No, it's all right, Ethel.
I'll take mine back.
Oh, I couldn't let you do that, honey.
I'll take mine back.
Well, somebody take something back.
Look, if it's going to create some hard feelings, why don't you both take them back?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
Okay, I'll go for that.
Yeah, we'll both take them back.
All right.
Yeah.
Honey, I'll meet you down at the television studio.
Oh, no, now, wait for me, honey.
I'm going with you.
Now, you just wait.
Lucy, isn't that the Yes, it is.
I got to thinking it was silly for both of us to take our dresses back.
As long as Ethel was taking hers back, there was no reason for me to take mine back.
Well, there isn't.
I didn't say a word.
I'll go and get Mrs. Trumbull to stay with Little Ricky.
Ricky?
What?
Do you think Ethel will be mad at me?
I wouldn't be surprised if she punched you right in the nose.
Why do you say that?
It's perfectly logical.
Well, if she was going to take her dress back, there's no reason why I have to take mine back.
Oh, for pete's sake, Ethel, aren't you ready yet?
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Why, Ethel Louise Mertz.
Well, there wasn't any sense in both of us taking our dresses back.
If she was going to take her dress back, I couldn't see any reason for me to take my dress back.
Well, one of us should have it.
It's such a pretty dress.
Come on, they're going to meet us down there.
I'm not going to let her see me till we do the number.
All right, all right.
Now if I may, I'd like to do a little number for you.
It's become quite popular in the last couple of months.
Se llego el momento ya de separarnos En silencio el corazon dice y suspira Vaya con dios, mi vida Vaya con dios, mi amor.
Las campanas de la iglesia suenan tristes Y parece que al sonar tambien te dicen Vaya con dios, mi vida Vaya con dios, mi amor.
Adonde vayas tu ire contigo En sueno siempre junto a ti estare Mi voz escucharas, dulce amor mio Y como yo estaras tambien a de volver.
La alborada al despertar feliz te espera Si en mi corazon yo voy adonde quiera Vaya con dios, mi vida Vaya con dios, mi amor.
Thank you, thank you, ladies, thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.
And now for the highlight of our show, we are very happy and proud to bring to you the co-presidents of the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League, Mrs. Ethel Mertz, Mrs. Lucy Ricardo, in Cole Porter's great number "Friendship.
" Maestro.
Thought you said you were going to take yours back.
You big stinker.
If you're ever in a jam, here I am.
If you're ever in a mess, S.O.S. If you ever get so happy you land in jail I'm your bail.
It's friendship, friendship, just the perfect blendship.
When other friendships have been forgot Ours will still be hot La da-da-da-da da-da dig-dig-dig A da-da-da-da da-da dig-dig-dig.
If you're ever up a tree A- phone to me.
If you're ever down a well Ring my bell.
If you ever lose your dough When you're out to dine, borrow mine.
It's friendship, friendship, just the perfect blendship.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Those things were always happening to us.
Oh, you characters.
So anyhow, we went down to Miami and asked the real estate man to show us our lot.
He pointed out in the bay and he said, "You see that row boat?
It's anchored on your lot.
"  We thought we were going to be millionaires.
Ah, here's Lucy.
Well, it's about time.
Let's go.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not ready yet.
Well, honey, Mrs. Trumbull is with Little Ricky.
Let's go.
Honey, it'll only be a minute.
My nails aren't dry.
But I'm hungry.
Come on now, sit down.
Tell another story, Fred.
Oh, well, all right.
Rick, did I ever tell you what happened to Ethel and me on our honeymoon?
Not lately.
Oh!
Did I tell you, Lucy?
Yes.
I was there.
Oh, I forgot.
Hey, you know, speaking of funny things that happen to people, Lucy, you remember the musicians' picnic last Fourth of July?
Oh, what a day that was.
What happened?
Oh, well I'll tell it, dear.
Oh, okay.
The, uh, the musicians' local was having a picnic, see it was for charity.
You know, you paid so much money and half of it went for charity and half of it went for the picnic.
That's right.
And all the boys in the band wanted to go, so Marco and Alberto and Pepin and Joe and Ralph- everybody was going down there.
So we left about 10:00 It was 12:00.
No, dear, it was 10:00.
No, honey, it was 12:00.
Well, what's the difference?
Two hours.
I mean to the story.
It doesn't make any difference.
Yes, it does, dear.
That's the reason we were late.
That's why Well, it's your story, go ahead.
Thank you.
Well, we got to the picnic grounds Don't forget about the cars.
What was that?
I said don't forget about the cars, dear.
Oh, the cars.
Yeah, that's right.
We took three cars.
Lucy and I were in the first car, Pepin was in the second car and Marco was in the last car.
Oh, honey, you're ruining everything.
Would you like to tell the story?
No, dear, you're the storyteller in the family, but I just want you to get it right.
Now, Pepin was in the first car, Marco was in the second and we were in the last.
Maybe Pepin was in the first car, and you were in the second and Marco was in the third.
Fred.
Well, it was the only combination left.
Okay, I take it all back.
We all took the same bus.
Coward.
Anyway we got to the picnic grounds about Don't look at me.
I'm not going to say anything more.
Good.
I'm not going to tell you what you left out.
Anyway, we got to the picnic grounds about um what did I leave out?
Nothing, go on with the story.
Well, it feels like there's something missing there someplace.
You sure?
Positive.
All right, well, we spread the food out and it started to rain.
Oh, it poured.
So we took everything and we ran to the cars and then when we got there Yeah, yeah, what happened?
What's the matter, Ricky?
What did I leave out?
Nothing, I was just kidding you.
Now go on.
Well, I'm telling you, it feels like there's something missing there someplace.
Oh, what's the difference?
Go on and finish it.
Well Oh, the heck with it.
It's not funny anymore.
Come on, let's go and have dinner.
Well, all right.
My nails are dry now.
Let's go to that place on 45th Street.
Oh, I hear they have wonderful steaks.
Well, I don't particularly feel like a steak.
Steak sounds wonderful.
We'll go there.
Now, wait just a minute, Lucy.
What's the matter?
Well, I just had about enough of this.
First you keep everybody waiting while you're fixing your nails.
Then-then you keep interrupting me while I'm telling the story, and now you decide all by yourself where we're going to eat dinner because you want a steak.
Well, Ricky, I Well, I don't feel like eating steak tonight.
I want to eat spaghetti tonight.
Well, maybe So we're going to eat spaghetti.
Yes, sir.
And the next time that I tell a story, you stay out of it.
Yes, sir.
And be on time from now on, or we're going to go without you.
Yes, sir.
We're going to run this house like we do in Cuba, where the man is the master and the woman does what she's told.
Si, senor.
And don't get smart.
Now go get your coat.
Oh, yeah?
!
Attagirl, Lucy.
I was wondering what happened to you.
It just sunk in.
I don't know how you treat your women in Cuba, but this is the United States, and I have my rights.
I am not arguing about women's rights.
I am the first one to agree that women should have all the rights they want as long as they stay in their place.
That's telling her.
Oh, you're just as bad as he is, Fred.
You men tell us that we have equal rights, but you certainly don't give us a chance to act like it.
What do you want?
You've got the vote, you wear pants, you drive buses, you wrestle.
You go every place you please except the steam room in the Y.M.C.A.

That isn't true.
Equal rights means just what it says- equal rights.
Well, that's a good explanation.
Oh, you know what she means.
Yes, and we want to be treated that way.
From now on, everything is equal.
We want to be treated exactly as if we were men.
Well, this calls for a little conference.
Pardon me, mister.
Okay.
From now on you have equal rights.
We will treat you exactly as if you were men.
Is it a deal?
It's a deal.
What about you, mac?
It's a deal.
Let's get our coats, Lucy.
Listen, what did you say about this plumber that you I phoned him this morning.
He's coming out this afternoon Ricky, that's my coat.
I know that's your coat, honey.
This is my coat over here.
up this afternoon, checked everything in the house.
Oh, come on, let's put them on ourselves.
Say, I was going to say when you came in the room, You like it?
that suit is just beautiful.
Oh, I'm crazy about it.
Thank you.
One of the prettiest ones I ever saw.
Oh!
Pardon me, mister, my fault.
You know this fellow looks familiar to me.
Reminds me of my father.
This way, please.
Thank you.
The least you could do is pull out my chair for me.
Never mind, Ethel.
They're just being smart.
Ignore them.
Honey, what are you talking about?
We're just treating you as equals.
Yeah, isn't that what you wanted?
Oh.
May I take your order?
Yes, I think I'd like some meatballs, spaghetti, and some pizza.
Now, what would you like?
Bring me some meatballs and spaghetti and pizza.
And a little green salad.
Green salad, yes.
Now what would you like?
And some coffee with my meal, please?
Me, too.
Now what will you have?
Are you sure you're quite through?
Yes, dear, go ahead and order.
Don't keep the man waiting.
Uh, I would like Oh, dear, now I forgot what I wanted, you took so long ordering.
Oh, yes, I'd like a steak, medium rare and spaghetti on the side.
Certainly, and you?
I'll take the same, well done.
Well done- thank you.
Oh, I dropped my purse, dear.
Can you see it there?
Yep.
It's right there by my foot.
Uh, would you excuse us a minute?
We'll be right back.
Where you going?
Oh, we're just going to the drugstore.
We'll be back before the food gets here.
Fred Oh, boy, that was a great meal.
Wasn't that wonderful?
We ought to come back here more often.
Yes, sir.
Cigarette?
Thank you.
Light?
Thank you.
At least two of us are gentlemen.
How do I look?
Uh, we could both stand a repair job.
Oh, you look all right.
Um, how do I look, Fred?
Pretty bad.
I guess we could stand a repair job, too.
Always kidding.
Ricky, Ricky!
Oh, now, Fred!
Fred!
This is a terrible thing Oh, for heaven's sake.
Oh, fellas, we get your message.
All right, okay.
Oh, now, Ricky, really.
All right.
Equal rights, dear.
Equal rights, equal rights.
All right.
We get your point, we get your point.
You win.
Oh, really, boys.
Oh, no.
Well, I've seen everything now.
All right, let's get the check and get out of here.
Okay.
Uh Xavier?
Yes, sir?
Something more for you- more coffee, dessert after-shave lotion?
Just the check, please.
He has a sense of humor.
Pardon me a minute.
Honestly, it's getting so you can expect anything from these two goofs we're married to.
That's the first time Fred's shaved in a week.
You should've seen the look on your faces.
Oh, that was a good meal.
Uh-huh.
It really was.
You two.
Thank you, sir.
Characters.
What's this?
Separate checks.
What do you mean, separate checks?
Equal rights, dear.
Fred, aren't you going to pay for my dinner?
And take away your independence?
Never.
All right, Ethel, we can go along with the gag.
I'll say.
If you want to play it that way, okay Say, Lucy, have you got any I don't have any What'd you say?
Do you have any money?
I haven't got a cent.
I was going to put the bite on you.
You took the bite right out of my mouth.
This is a little embarrassing, Rick.
I didn't know we came to dinner with a couple of deadbeats.
Well, you never can tell, Fred.
Looks like.
See you along see you around, gir fellas.
Oh, now, wait a minute.
Come here now, Ricky.
Oh, Fred, now wait a minute.
That's carrying it a little too far.
Ricky, Ricky, come here.
Pardon me.
What are you trying to do- skip out without paying?
Well, our husbands were playing a little joke on us.
They said we were going to have to pay for our dinner.
Yes.
But we don't have any money with us.
Isn't that funny?
Well, we'll go home and come right back with the money.
We'll bring it right back to you.
Well, what do you want us to do?
You know what this is?
It's a dish.
Right.
And we have lots more in the kitchen.
People have been eating off them.
They get so dirty.
Just a minute!
We're not washing any dishes.
We're not washing any dishes, are we?
Uh-huh.
Well, now, look, Xavier, don't tell them that I called.
See, but as soon as they finish washing the dishes, you call me and we'll come down and pick them up.
Okay, all right.
Everybody's gone and they're still working their heads off down there.
Oh, girls if you don't mind, will you let me know when you're finished?
I'll be in my office.
I'm waiting to lock up!
: He's waiting to lock up.
Oh, we don't mind.
When you finish.
Finish, waiting to lock up.
I hope he never locks up.
No!
Those are clean.
I never worked so hard in my life.
Neither did I. I wonder where all these came from.
I don't know.
I think he takes in dirty dishes from other restaurants.
Honestly, every time I think of those boobs we're married to, I just get furious.
So do I. They make me so mad.
Maybe this'll teach you to keep your big mouth shut.
Me?
What do you mean?
Well it was your idea about this equal rights business.
Just a minute.
You thought it was a good idea then.
Well, it stinks now.
Well, it's nice to know that you're the kind of a person who turns on a friend in a crisis.
Oh, listen, Lucy, I've been going through this type of thing with you for 11 years.
This is my last crisis.
I'm through.
Oh, don't cry.
I didn't mean anything I said.
I'm so upset!
I know, so am I. Lucy, you mustn't cry anymore.
You're right, I'm making the dishwater cold.
Oh, well, the main thing is to get these dishes done so we can get home.
Yeah!
Wait a minute.
We don't have any money to get home on.
Oh, yeah.
How do you like those husbands of ours?
We'll have to walk, all that way through those dark streets alone.
Yeah, and I wouldn't be surprised if a thug jumped out from behind a dark building and pounced on us and said, "Your money or your life.
" And you know where that'll leave us.
Oh, no.
Yeah, and maybe he'll conk us on the head and he'll leave us broken and bleeding in an alley.
And then Ricky and Fred'll be sorry.
They'll be sorry?
Hey, I know how we can get even with them.
How?
Well, I'll call Ricky and I'll tell him that the restaurant's being held up, and you yell, "Help"!
and make noises like struggling in the background.
Lucy, how do you think up all these wonderful things?
Promise me when you die, you'll leave your brain to science.
Okay.
Coast is clear.
Hello?
Hello, Ricky, this is Lucy.
It's Lucy.
Where are you, honey?
Oh, we're still at the restaurant.
They made us do the dishes.
No.
Yeah, but we're almost finished, and we were wondering if you could come and Oh.
Oh, now-now you stay away from me.
You stay away from me with that gun.
What's the matter, honey?
!
What's the matter?
!
Two masked men just came in with guns.
What?
What's going on?
!
What's the matter?
: This is a stickup.
Don't move or I'll shoot.
Honey, what's the matter?
Help!
Murder!
Police!
Don't shoot!
Don't come near me with that gun, and don't hit Ethel.
Don't you dare hit Ethel.
Don't you dare hit Ethel!
Help!
Murder!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.
Save us.
Somebody save us!
Oh, come and save us.
Help!
Help!

Honey, what's going on!
Please, what's the matter?
Lucy, please.

They're holding up a restaurant at 39th near Eighth.
Never mind who this is.
Just meet us there.
Meet us there, that's right.
Come on, let's go.
The cops aren't here yet.
We'll have to do it ourselves.
Grab a chair.
How do you like that?
What a dirty trick to scare us half out of our wits like that.
Oh, boy, they got even with us, all right.
Yeah.
And they'll never know it.
I'll say they won't.
Come on, now let's get out of here.
No, wait a minute.
This story about the bandits is too good to pass it up.
Yeah?
You got a handkerchief?
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, that's it.
Just got to move those over there, and we're finished.
Oh, boy.
Here we go.
What a night.
Ethel, what's the matter with you?
Are you crazy or something?
What's the matter with you?
Ricky Ricardo.
Fred Mertz.
: Two bandits are holding us up.
Ahh!
Ahhh!
Look at these brave women.
All right, you guys, let's go.
Now, wait a minute, fellows!
What's the matter with you guys?
Are you crazy or something?
This is all a joke.
A joke?
Sure, it's a joke.
These are our wives here.
That's right.
Our sweet, loving, little wives.
Sure.
Well, you see, they acted Look, they wanted equal rights, so we said fine, we give you equal rights.
From now on we treat you just like you were men.
So we came down here to this restaurant, we said give us separate checks to the head waiter.
You know, I tell him the whole story.
So the head waiters come and gives us separate checks.
They don't have any money to pay.
I was in cahoots with the guy.
So he tells them, all right, you have to wash the dishes.
To teach them a story we let them go here and wash the dishes.
Now they called the house, and just to scare us they tell us there is a couple of bandits down here with guns and they're holding us up.
So he and I, we come down here like a couple of jerks to save them, and we realize there's no bandits around in here.
So we said okay, we can't lose this chance.
We put the handkerchiefs and the hats and the stuff and we come in here with the gun, and it was, you know, just to scare them, and that's all there was to it, for goodness sakes.
Isn't that right, honey?
We never saw them before in our lives.
All right you guys, stand up.
The girls you held up want to take another look at you before they sign the complaint.
This way, ladies.
Mean looking, aren't they?
Yeah.
Lucy Fresh, too, calls me by my first name.
The young one isn't so bad looking.
He has a certain amount of animal charm.
I guess this old shriveled up one is his father.
They're no good, lady.
Anybody can see that.
We'll all be better off if you could sign the complaint and we can put them away.
Okay.
Oh, wait a minute.
Uh, you know, the more I look at him, the cuter he gets.
I wonder how he kisses.
Kisses?
Not bad.
Wonder how grandpa kisses.
Eh Close your mouth and open the door.
Equal rights.
Equal rights.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hi, dear.
I picked up the baby pictures.
Oh, let me see, let me see.
Wait a minute.
Let go.
Honey, I haven't seen them either.
Oh, honey, I don't want you to see them before I do.
Honey, we'll look at them together.
Well, all right.
Gee, I can hardly wait to see what they look like after all we went through taking them.
What do you mean "we went through"?
I took them, remember.
Oh, sure, but I was the one that had to stand on my head to make Little Ricky laugh.
Oh, honey, they gave you the wrong pictures.
This is a picture of twins.
But they're both Little Ricky.
How did you manage that?
Oh, it's double exposure.
It can happen to anybody.
Oh.
There's only one of him in that shot.
Yeah, but that's so blurry.
You take wonderful x-rays, dear.
Well, I can't help it if he moved.
Oh, look.
Isn't that great?
Hey, I'm a pretty good photographer after all.
Oh, I'll say you are.
Oh, here's another wonderful one.
Oh, gosh!
Oh, these pictures are good enough to be on the cover of a magazine.
What magazine, Body Beautiful?
Oh.
Well, even professional photographers are entitled to a boo-boo now and then.
Oh, these pictures are much better than any pictures the Applebys ever took of their baby.
Well, we have an advantage over the Applebys.
Our baby's handsome.
Yeah.
Oh!
Wait till they come over tonight and I show them what real baby pictures look like.
Wha-bup-bup-bup-bup- What's this about who coming over tonight?
Oh, didn't I tell you, dear?
No, you didn't tell me, dear.
Well, uh, Caroline and Charlie Appleby are coming over tonight.
Oh, no, they're not.
My house is in no shape for company.
You just call them right up, Look, honey tell them we can't see them tonight.
Charlie wants to talk to me about a television show, so I asked him to come over and he's going to be here at 8:00.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Wait till he pulls the pictures of his baby out and I let him have it with these.
What are you doing?
We're not showing those pictures to anyone.
Why?
Because of a vow that you and I made.
Vow?
Yes, before we had a baby, do you remember how bored we always were when other people dragged out pictures of their little darlings and insisted that we look at them?
Yeah.
And do you remember that we promised each other that if we ever had a child that we wouldn't inflict his pictures on other people.
I know, honey, but Little Ricky's not like any ordinary baby.
I mean, he's so cute that people want to see his pictures.
Yeah, I know.
Well No, now, that's what all parents think.
Now, we promised, Ricky.
Okay, but I'm not going to be very happy when Charlie starts bragging about his little brat.
Well, so long as we're not boring people with pictures of our kid Charlie wants you to do a television show?
!
Well, that's certainly a delayed reaction.
What kind of a show?
When is it going to be?
Who's going to be in it?
Variety, next Thursday, and not you.
Now, Ricky, please.
Look, honey, look I'm only the master of ceremonies.
I don't hire the talent, I have nothing to do with the talent, so there's nothing I can do for you.
But if you did and you were, would you?
But I don't, and I'm not.
But if you did, and you were, would you?
If I did, and I were, I would.
Well, now I don't know what we said.
But I guess as long as you're not, it doesn't matter.
That's the sensible way to look at it.
Now, honey, remember we're not showing those pictures to anybody tonight.
Okay, okay.
Isn't he cute?
Oh, these are wonderful pictures, Ricky.
How about that one, eh?
Yeah, I like this one where he's got the baseball cap on.
He's a cutie, all right.
Hey, that's a pretty good idea for a picture, putting a baseball cap on him.
Yeah, I'll say it is.
I thought of that.
Very clever.
Look at this one here.
Oh, he took a picture of the doll we gave him.
That's his favorite doll.
And Lucy's embroidered his name on his little suit.
Yeah, Ricky, Jr. Ricky, what are you doing with those pictures?
He was showing them to us.
You promised not to show them to anybody.
Well, the Mertzes aren't anybody.
Well!
Thanks a lot.
I didn't mean that.
Lucy made me promise that I wasn't going to bore people with the pictures of the baby.
Well, he's certainly not boring us.
We're his godmother and godfather.
Sure, they're the kid's godfolks.
Yeah, watch it, will you?
Well, maybe it's all right for you, but nobody else, remember.
You mean you're not going to show them to the Applebys?
That's right.
Oh, come on.
Oh, come on.
Now, somebody has to take them down a peg.
That's right.
Yeah.
Nope.
Oh, now, that's all they talk about.
The way they act, you'd think they invented babies.
Exactly, and we don't want to be like the Applebys.
There they are, honey.
Hello.
Hi, Lucy.
The Applebys.
Hi, Caroline.
How are you?
Give me your coat.
Hi, Fred, Ethel.
Gee, I'm sorry we're late, but just as we walked out the door tonight, guess what little Stevie did.
Oh, yeah, it was the cutest thing you ever saw.
Tell them, honey.
Now, mind you, he's only 13 months old.
Well, just as we were walking out the door, he looked up at us, raised his little hand and said, "bye-bye.
" "Bye-bye"?
All by himself, bye-bye.
How about that, huh?
Bye-bye.
Yeah, how about that?
All by himself.
And only 13 months old, gee.
Oh, that certainly is amazing.
Is that a new dress you have on, Caroline?
This old rag?
Yes.
Oh, goodness, no.
Let me see, What else did I want to tell you about little Stevie darling?
Um um Uh, Charlie, how's everything down at the television station?
Oh, great, Rick, just great.
We've got the newest moving pictures in town.
You know, I bought a block of films yesterday, and I want to tell you that they're going to make television stars out of some of the actors.
No kidding.
Yes, sir.
Now, just remember their names- Conway Turrell and Mabel Norman.
Yeah, well, we'll catch them.
We never we always watch your television station.
Well, that's what makes a station popular- good pictures.
: Good pictures!
Oh, we've got some new pictures of Stevie.
Do you want to see them?
They're right here.
They're just marvelous.
You know, Charlie took them the other day on his first birthday.
Look at this one- he's trying to blow out the candle.
Aw Oh, cute.
Look at the little dickens.
He put his hand in the cake.
I tell you, that little Stevie's a natural-born comic.
Natural-born.
Oh!
Oh, this one this one is the best one of all.
The hat one.
Oh, Charlie thought of the cutest idea.
Well, you know, he's just a genius about these things anyway.
Do you know what he did?
He put a baseball cap on little Stevie.
Isn't that priceless?
Yeah, priceless.
Ready?
Yeah, I'm ready.
It isn't because he's my child, Rick, but I ask you, did you ever see a baby who took a better picture?
Did I, honey?
No, you didn't.
I didn't.
You know, from the moment he was born little Stevie was perfectly shaped absolutely handsome.
That's right.
You know how most babies are- all red and pinched and funny-looking.
Yeah.
Say, how is Little Ricky, anyway?
What?
Lucy, Charlie didn't mean that Little Ricky was all red and pinched and funny-looking.
He outgrew that, didn't he?
Now, you want to see a picture of a baby, look at this.
Now, there's a baby!
Look at those eyes.
Lucy!
Oh, I was just on my way over to your place.
Here's some money for the cleaning.
Will you pay the man when he comes?
Sure, where are you going?
Oh, I just thought I'd drop by and see Caroline Appleby.
Caroline Appleby?
I thought you were mad at her last night.
I was and I still am.
Well, then why are you going over there?
I just decided to take Little Ricky over there and show her what a cute baby really looks like.
Oh, Lucy, honestly.
Well, I don't care.
Little Ricky's twice as handsome as that scrawny little runt of theirs.
Of course he's handsomer than their child, but you'll have to admit some of their pictures were kind of cute.
One more remark like that and you can turn in your godmother suit.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Little Ricky's wearing his brand-new outfit, but I don't suppose that interests you.
Oh, isn't he precious?
As precious as little Stevie Appleby?
He's ten times preciouser than that silly-looking little goon.
You may kiss your reinstated godmother.
Oh, thank you.
Put on your little hatsy.
Lucy, aren't you being kind of mean dropping in on Caroline unannounced with Little Ricky all dressed up like that?
Yeah.
Oh, I see.
I guess all's fair in love and motherhood.
That's right, here we go.
Byesie-byesie.
Bye-bye, honey.
Say bye-bye, Ricky.
Bye-bye, darling.
Say bye-bye.
Say bye-bye.
Who is it?
Lucy Ricardo.
Lucy Oh, Lucy, how nice of you to drop by.
Uh come on up.
Come in.
Oh, hello, Caroline.
Why, Lucy, you've got Ricky with you.
Yes, I hope we haven't come at an inopportune time.
Oh, no, I was just sitting here relaxing.
Oh.
Uh Oh, Lucy, you'll just have to forgive the mess the apartment's in.
I just haven't had a chance to do a thing this morning.
Well, that's all right.
I hope we haven't come at the wrong time for little Stevie.
He isn't sleeping or all dirty or something, is he?
No, no, he's all dressed up.
As a matter of fact, I was just waiting for his grandmother to come for him.
Oh.
I'll go get him.
Oh, all right.
Take your coat off, baby.
Take your coat off, come on now.
There we go.
Now, you wait for little Stevie.
You wait for little Stevie.
Here we are.
Now say hello to Little Ricky, Stevie.
Say hello, Stevie.
There.
Say hello.
Say hello.
Oh, little sweetie.
Uh, my, Stevie's grown a lot since I last saw him.
Oh, yeah, he's really shooting up.
Oh, yes, when do you think he'll reach normal size?
He's exactly the size he's supposed to be.
He just seems small to you 'cause you're so used to looking at little fatty here.
Fatty?
Oh, yes.
I just love chubby, puffy little boys.
Oh, Ricky, you're going to have to go on a diet or you'll grow up to look like your mommy.
What's new, Caroline?
Well Oh, say, what if I take the children and put them outside in Stevie's playpen?
Then they can get acquainted.
Well, all right.
All righty.
There.
There you are.
Now, you be good little boys.
Oh!
Now, what were we saying?
Oh, yes, you were just asking me what's new.
Yes.
Well, I hate to sound like the doting mother, but what do you think little Stevie did today?
Don't tell me he took a picture of you for a change.
No, he put two words together for the first time.
Not until today?
Oh, don't tell me that Little Ricky has ever put two words together.
Why, certainly, dear.
I don't mean da-da.
Of course not.
Has he ever said, "Morning, Mommy"?
In English or Spanish?
He speaks Spanish?
Only when he's mad.
Well, Lucy, it certainly was chummy of you to drop by like this today.
How long must you stay?
Well, I hate to rush off like this, but I really must.
Oh, that is a smart suit you're wearing.
Oh, do you like it?
You know I always have.
I'd like my baby, please.
Where do you keep your child's cage?
Well!
I just hope that little glutton of yours hasn't taught my Stevie any bad habits.
That goes double.
My little Stevie doesn't have any bad habits.
I hope he doesn't copy any of his good habits like scratching himself or peeling bananas with his feet.
Thanks for a lovely time.
You're welcome.
So I said, "Well, I hope Little Ricky doesn't copy "any of his good habits like scratching himself or peeling bananas with his feet," and we left.
Oh, Lucy, what's this going to do to Ricky's TV show tomorrow?
Charlie will probably cancel the whole thing.
Oh, Ricky's going to be furious.
I know, but I couldn't help it.
I felt like a mother bear defending her cub.
Well, when you tell him, I'd hate to be in your shoes.
It's not my shoes I'm worried about.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi.
Hi.
Ethel, I come over to tell you I'm going to the market to get a chicken.
A chicken?
I got one in the oven.
Oh, I forgot all about it!
Never mind, it's too late.
Is it very burned?
Well, if we had three and 20 more, we could bake them in a pie.
Oh, dear.
Hey, I was just telling Fred about rehearsal for the television show.
It was wonderful.
It's going to be a great show tomorrow night.
Oh?
Oh.
Uh-oh.
Well, come on, Fred.
Let's go.
Well, what's your rush?
Well, we got get to the market and get a chicken right now.
Oh, all right, all right.
Oh, those two.
Uh Ricky?
Yes, honey.
Uh, I was just thinking about your television show for Charlie Appleby.
I don't think that's a very good thing for you.
Not a good thing for me?
Why, it's my big chance to get in my own television show.
Well, what do you want with that?
Television isn't going to last.
It's just a fad.
A fad?
Yeah, like flagpole-sitting or swallowing goldfish.
Lucy, what are you talking about?
Well, besides, Charlie's Charlie's station doesn't come in clear.
You get all distorted.
What?
Yeah, you look all funny like this.
Babalu, babalu, babalu, ay-aye.
Lucy, what are you up to?
Nothing, but I just don't want you disappointed if television turns out to be a big flop.
Well, honey, thank you very much, but I'll take my chances.
Oh.
I think I'll call Caroline and see what she's doing tomorrow night.
Okay.
Oh, hello.
Oh, hello, Charlie?
Oh, Charlie, this is Lucy Lucy Ricardo.
Oh, fine, thanks.
Is Caroline th?
What?
Oh, Charlie, that's terrible.
The cameraman?
Mumps?
!
Oh, for heaven's sake.
And the studio's going to be quarantined?
And you won't be able to make any shows there for a couple of weeks, huh?
Oh, well, I'll tell Ricky  I'll I'll tell Ricky  Well  Hello.
Oh, hello, Charlie, this is Ricky.
Charlie, I don't But Charlie, I but Charlie, Ch Don't hang up, Charlie.
I'll explain.
That was Charlie.
Charlie who?
You know Charlie who.
What did you say to Caroline?
Caroline who?
Oh, Charlie who's wife?
Yeah.
And I don't get the job.
Well, that's show business.
You know, there's no business like show business.
Yesterday, they told you you will not go far.
Tomorrow, on your dressing room, they hang a star?
Lucy, what did you say to Caroline?
Nothing.
Nothing that should upset her.
I just said that little Stevie was scrawny and little and looked like a monkey.
Oh, is that all?
Yeah.
What did you say that for?
!
What did you have to go over there for?
Why don't you stay here where you belong?
What are you trying to do to me?
Well?
I'm still working on what'd I say that for?
Uno de estos dias te voy a  You wouldn't dare.
Okay, now, you started this, so you're going to finish it.
Well, what'll I have to do?
You're going to get me back on that television show.
How?
I don't know how, but if you dun't, All right.
I'll, I'll I will, I will, Ricky.
I'll get you back on the show.
Don't even think of what you'll do if I "dun't.
" Ahora, i¡que va!
If you're romantic, chum Pack up your thoughts and come to Acapulco You put your cares in hock And throw away your clock in Acapulco Where you can be as lazy As a daisy drifting in a blue lagoon You're wide awake at night Because you do your dreaming in the afternoon.
You'll get a Latin glow way down in Mexico Below the border And in a spot like this, if you refuse a kiss You're out of order And when the moon is new, it's like a honeydew Come on and get yourself a slice And if you can't say Acapulco Then you can call it paradise.
Yeah!
Look out, look out, look out.
You'll need some new huaraches When the mariachis start to play there And after you depart You know your crazy heart may want to stay there And if the moon is new, it's like a honeydew Come on and get yourself a slice And if you can't say Acapulco Then you can call it paradise And if I haven't sold you with the things I've told you Then I must repeat it twice That if you can't say Acapulco Then you can call it paradise.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
And now I have a surprise for you.
You know, most performers don't like to have babies with them in their show because they say that the babies always steal all the scenes.
But my wife found such a cute baby today, such an adorable child with such great personality, so beautiful, so intelligent, that she insisted that I put this child on the show tonight.
So now, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to introduce to you my wife, Lucy, with her idea of the most beautiful baby in the whole wide world.
And here they are- Lucy and little Stevie Appleby.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Oh, no!
Isn't it awful when something like that happens right out on the stage and there's nothing you can do about it?
I know.
Is anybody hungry?
Hey, Fred, do you remember what happened to that quick- change artist- you know, the one who used to change her clothes in the dark right out on the stage?
Do I?
Boy, was she ever mad at that electrician.
What happened?
Well, she called for her tights and he thought she said "lights.
" Uh it's very amusing.
Oh, I'm sorry, Lucy.
Oh, we shouldn't talk about our old times in show business in front of Lucy.
It makes her feel left out.
Oh, no, it doesn't.
Yeah.
If you haven't been in show business yourself, it must all seem kind of dull.
I've been in show business.
Well, Ethel means real show business not trying to get in Ricky's act.
I've been in show business!
Honey, Ethel means show business, not playing a petunia in a grammar school recital.
You think you know all there is to know about me, don't you?
Remind me sometime to tell you about my experience in musical comedy.
Come on, Ethel, let's get some coffee.
Hey, just a minute.
You were in musical comedy?
It was before I met you, dear.
Come on, Ethel.
Now, wait, wait a minute.
This is very interesting.
What was the name of the musical comedy?
Oh, leave her alone, Ricky.
She's just exaggerating as usual.
I am not.
Well, what was the name of the musical comedy?
Oklahoma.
Oklahoma?
Oklahoma?
Oklahoma, and I was the star too.
Yeah?
What was your maiden name, Alfred Drake?
Well, maybe I wasn't exactly the star, but would you believe I was a featured player?
Chorus girl?
Ticket taker?
Lucy, why don't you tell the truth?
You know that you were never in Oklahoma.
I was, too.
I spent two weeks in Tulsa once.
Why do you do it?
You always fib and you always get caught.
I do not fib.
I never told a fib in my life.
Oh, there she goes again.
Well, it isn't fibbing.
I just like to color things a little.
Well, why didn't you say so?
I'll buy you some watercolors.
Oh, you're all very funny.
Very funny.
Oh, thank you.
Flowers.
Oh, Ricky, you shouldn't have.
I din't.
You "din't"?
Oh, no, these are for you.
For me?
Who's sending you flowers?
"Get well quick.
Love, Jim and Dorothy.
" I feel fine.
Oh, I know.
I didn't want to go to dinner with Jim and Dorothy Wynn tonight, so I told them that you sprained your ankle.
There's another one.
Oh, now, what's the matter with that?
That's just a little social fib.
Honey, you knew that we were going to have dinner with the Mertzes.
Why didn't you just tell them the truth?
You can't tell people the truth.
They think you're lying.
You have to lie to make them think you're telling the truth.
But it's not funny.
You got to cut it out.
Now, now, Ricky, don't be too tough on Lucy.
Thanks, Fred.
She can't help it if she's a liar.
Well!
Oh, Fred didn't mean it like that.
He just means the colorful way you push the truth around is part of your character.
Yeah.
Molly McGee should have such a fibber.
Oh, I think you're all just horrid.
I could tell the absolute truth like everybody else if I wanted to be dull, present company not excepted.
Honey, you couldn't tell the absolute truth if your whole life depended on it.
Would you like to risk a little money on that proposition?
I most certainly would.
I'll tell you what.
I'll bet you that you can't tell the truth for, uh For how long, one week?
I'll make easy on you- one day, 24 hours.
Okay.
How much you want to bet?
Make it easy on yourself.
Any part of $100.
I'll take it all.
Can I have a piece of that?
I'd like a little of that, too.
My friends.
Oh, it hasn't anything to do with friendship.
It's just that there are so few sure ways of making a buck these days.
I'll tell you what, I'll take 50 and I'll give you each 25.
Thank you.
Fine.
Uh when do you want to start?
It's one minute to 8:00.
I'll start on the hour.
Okay, you got yourself a bet.
Okay.
Did I ever tell you the time that Cary Grant asked me marry him?
It hasn't started yet.
I just thought I'd have one last fib for the road.
Okay, it's started.
For the next 24 hours.
Okay.
All right.
I can hardly wait to hear you tomorrow afternoon, Lucy.
Why?
We're playing bridge at Caroline's, remember?
Oh, no, no, no.
I can't spend the afternoon with three women and have to tell the truth.
I'll call Caroline and tell her I'm sick.
Eww You'll go?
I'll go.
Hi.
How are you?
Oh, look!
Oh, Caroline, you've redecorated.
Yep.
Changed the whole mood of the room.
My, I'll say.
We threw out everything we had that was early American and started fresh with Chinese modern.
Here, let me take your coats.
I'll put them in the bedroom.
For heaven's sake.
Gee, isn't this something, huh?
Thank you.
There.
Look at this.
This is really something, isn't it?
And I thought it was awful before.
It looks like I don't know what.
I do.
It looks like a bad dream you'd have after eating too much Chinese food.
Ooh.
Well, how do you like my new furniture?
Oh, we were just talking about it.
Weren't we, Lucy?
What do you think?
Do you like it?
Oh, I think it's just lovely.
What do you think, Lucy?
Uh Oh, don't be bashful.
Just tell her what you said to me.
Oh, she doesn't want my little old opinion.
Oh, but I do, Lucy.
Come on, now.
Tell me exactly what you told Ethel about my furniture.
Well, uh I said it looked like a dream.
Didn't I, Ethel?
Isn't that what I said?
Yes.
Oh, well, thank you.
Oh, that's all right.
What kind of a dream, Lucy?
Well, let's play bridge.
Lucy, we have to wait for Marian.
Marian who?
Marian Strong.
When you're having four for bridge, it's always polite to wait until the fourth person arrives before you start playing.
It's the only decent thing to do.
Oh.
Now, let's see.
What were we talking about?
Oh, yes Caroline's furniture.
Uh, what kind of a dream, Lucy?
Caroline, I told Ethel that your furniture looked like a bad dream you'd have after eating too much Chinese food.
Well!
Is that what you really think?
Yes.
Well, Lucy, I hope it gives you a lot of pleasure to insult me.
No, it doesn't.
I don't like it any better than you do.
Well, nobody's twisting your arm.
Oh, no?
Before you get too mad, Caroline, I think you ought to know something.
Last night, Ricky and Fred and I bet Lucy $100 that she couldn't tell the absolute truth for 24 hours.
Oh.
So you see, it wasn't my fault.
I was tricked into it by old sneaky here.
Well, that explains it, but it doesn't make me feel any better.
Oh, Marian.
Hi, Marian.
Hi, Caroline.
How are you?
Hi, Ethel.
How are you?
Oh, Marian!
That's a new hat.
Yes.
Do you like it?
Oh, I think it's lovely.
It's beautiful.
Oh, thank you.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi, Marian.
Uh, Lucy, Marian has on a new hat.
Yeah, Marian.
Take it off.
Let's play bridge.
Lucy, what do you think of Marian's new hat?
Oh, that's a hat, all right.
Yeah, but what do you think about it?
Well, Marian, if that's the kind of hat you wanted, you sure got a good one.
No, seriously, Lucy.
Well, Marian, nothing personal, but I think that's the silliest- looking hat I've ever seen.
Oh, now, come on, Lucy.
Tell me what you think of it?
I am serious.
It's horrible.
I think there's something you ought to know.
Last night, we bet Lucy $100 that she couldn't tell the truth for Oh, no.
Then that's what she really thinks of my hat.
Come on, let's play bridge.
That is if anyone still wants to play with me.
Uh Marian, bring your things over here.
Well, come on.
Okay.
Lucy, how old are you?
How much do you weigh?
What color would your hair be if you didn't dye it?
and mousy brown.
Anything else you'd like to ask me?
What?
Go ahead, ask me anything you like- I like it.
It feels wonderful to tell the truth.
Now, she's trying to use psychology on us.
No, I mean it.
I feel very relieved.
It is wonderful to tell the truth.
You should try it sometime.
We'd all be much better friends.
Somehow, I doubt that.
Well, you do as you please.
I feel great.
Come on, let's play bridge.
I'm your partner this week, aren't I, Caroline?
Oh, I guess I play with you.
And, Caroline, let someone else keep score this week.
You cheat.
Yes, cheat.
The last three times we've played, you added up the score in your favor.
I would have said something about it if I hadn't been your partner.
Well, I never!
And you stop jabbering and keep your mind on the game.
You talk so much you don't know what cards have been played.
Well!
Oh, I'm sorry, Ethel, but it's so true.
Marian, stop cackling.
I've been waiting ten years for you to lay that egg.
For heaven's sake, Caroline, when are you going to get a new deck of cards?
We've been playing with this same dirty old deck since I've known you.
Hey, how about that fella?
Listen, Ricky, show your Uncle Fred how I taught you how to wave bye-bye this morning.
Show him.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Ricky.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Looks more like he's teaching us how to wave bye-bye.
Well, he did it this morning.
Now, look here, old man.
You're going to have to learn how to perform on cue if you're going to be my son.
Hi.
Oh, here's your mommy.
Oh, that's your mommy.
Was he a good boy?
He was an angel.
Where's Ethel?
She'll be right up.
Did you feed him?
Yeah, I followed your instructions to the letter.
Looks like you fed a whole nursery full of babies.
Well, he was hungry.
Come on, honey, we go beddy-bye.
Bye, old man.
Bye.
Say bye-bye.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
They never do what you want them to do when you want them to do it.
I know it.
I can't help it.
Hi.
Hi.
How was the bridge game?
Oh, yeah, how did we do?
Is the bet all over?
Not at all.
What?
Not at all?
She never told one lie all afternoon.
I don't believe it.
What did she do, tape her mouth shut?
I wish she had.
She not only told the truth, but she got brutally frank and told us all exactly what she thought of us.
Oh, boy, I wish I'd have been there.
Oh, that must have been good.
When you two hyenas get through laughing, you can go dig up a hundred bucks between you.
Oh, don't be silly.
She won't be able to keep it up.
Not Lucy.
What's so funny?
Ethel was telling us what happened when you told the girls the truth this afternoon.
Oh, yeah, they all got a little miffed, but I don't care.
I feel wonderful telling the truth.
Well, I don't feel so wonderful finding out you hate to play bridge with me.
Well, I wouldn't if you'd stop gabbing once in a while.
Oh, you shut up, Fred.
You're no rose.
I'll say he's not.
Yeah.
Why don't you buy Ethel a new dress once in a while?
Yeah, you tell him, Lucy.
If you weren't such a tightwad, she wouldn't have to go around looking so tacky.
Tightwad?
Tacky?
Come on, let's get out of here.
We don't have to be insulted.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Fred and Ethel.
I don't blame you for being a little huffy but after all, we were the ones who forced Lucy to tell the truth.
Well, that's right.
And besides, a few truthful criticisms would do us all a lot of good.
Oh, that's easy for you to say.
She hasn't said anything about you yet.
Yeah.
Okay.
Go ahead, Lucy, tell me my faults.
Tell me what you really think of me.
I think you are the most handsome, the most wonderful, the cleverest and the most talented man in the whole world.
The truth didn't hurt me.
Oh, brother.
Can you think of any other faults of mine?
Yes, you're hammy, you're stubborn and you're a coward.
A coward?
How do you like it now?
She's really telling him, eh, Tightwad?
You said it, Tacky.
Now, let's wait a minute.
What is this business about being a coward?
I'm not afraid of anything.
Yeah, he proves it every time he steps on the stage.
Never mind the wisecracks.
What is this coward routine?
You are afraid that if I got half a chance at a career that I would be the star of the family.
Oh, I see.
You would, eh?
I have more talent in my little finger than most people have in their whole body.
Uh-huh well, I'll tell you what: I'm going to an audition tonight.
They're casting for one of the biggest shows in television.
Why don't you come along?
Okay, what'll I do?
Well, why don't you let them audition your little finger?
What does it do- sing, dance?
Never mind.
I'll show you.
Ethel, will you take care of Little Ricky?
Thank you.
I'll go get ready.
What's the matter with you, Ricky?
Yeah, you can't run out to an audition.
If she doesn't tell a lie by 8:00, we're out a hundred bucks.
I know, I know.
I just found a way how to a way to win the bet and keep her quiet about show business at the same time.
You lost me.
Well, look, I know the way that they conduct those auditions, and she won't get to first base unless she can prove to them that she's got some experience.
I don't get it.
I do.
If she lies about her experience to get a job, we win the bet, and if she doesn't lie about her experience, she won't get the audition.
Right.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Just give this to me slowly.
Now, look, if she doesn't win I can't understand where we come into Now, let me see- who's next?
Mercedes Minch.
You've got a nice list of credits here.
"Sings like a chicken.
" Sings like a chicken?
Well, this won't be the first "fowl" singer I've heard today.
Well, go right ahead, please.
Well, thank you very much.
Don't call us.
We'll call you when we need you.
Now, let me see What are you doing here?
Who's with Little Ricky?
We got Mrs. Trumbull to sit with him.
We couldn't miss this.
Lucille McGillicuddy.
"Singer, dancer, comedienne, "monologist, mistress of ceremonies, "after-dinner speaker, saxophonist, star, bit player or extra.
" That's quite some accomplishments.
Thank you I'm just going to sing and dance today.
Oh, just a moment, please.
There's nothing down here under experience.
Oh?
Where have you appeared before?
How's that?
I say, where have you appeared before?
Oh, uh well, I let's see, I just finished at, um Well, well, there's been so many places, it's hard to single one out.
Well, try.
Oh.
Uh I just finished a long run at Ricardo's.
Ricardo's?
Yes, sir.
I don't believe I've ever heard of that place.
What sort of an establishment is it?
Oh, well, it's a three-ringed circus.
Yes, it's quite a place.
You should drop by some night.
How long was your engagement there?
Yes, well, I'm ready.
I have my Oh, just a minute, please.
Where else have you appeared?
Well I was in 3D.
You say you've appeared in Third Dimension.
No, sir, I did not.
I said I was in 3D.
Well, what's 3D if it isn't Third Dimension?
It's the number on our apartment.
Well, I'm very sorry, Miss McGillicuddy, but we're only interested in professionals here.
Now, it's almost 8:00.
We have to move on.
We only have time for one more.
Now, let me see.
Professor Falconi.
Something about a woman, you're trying to say?
Anybody here speak Italian?
Huh?
Well, I'm afraid that's all for this session then.
Wait a minute, I speak Italian.
Well, I do speak Italian.
Ricky, Ricky, get me out of here!
I don't know how to speak Italian!
I'll pay the bet, I'll pay the bet.
Oh, honey.
I'll pay the bet.
I'm sorry I came in.
I'm sorry.
Oh, honey Don't worry, honey.
I'll pay the bet.
Oh, honey, you're wonderful.
No, you're not.
You let me stand up there and let him throw knives at me.
What's the matter with you, are you crazy or something?
Don't you love me anymore?
What are you trying to do, get rid of me?
Honey, he wasn't throwing knives at you.
What do you mean he wasn't throwing knives at me?
!
No, no, look, look, honey, I'll show you, look.
The knives come from the back.
Let one go.
You see?
You see, honey?
They come from the back.
Oh.
Oh, I.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
gonna get all fastened up here, young man, and then you go to bed.
Come on, now, sit still.
Come on, Ricky, sit still, honey, now, Mama's got to Come on, honey, I'm hungry.
I'm ready.
We can go as soon as Mrs. Trumbull gets here.
Hey, where are we going to eat?
We're going to meet the Mertzes at that French restaurant.
What French restaurant?
The new one, the one the Applebys told us about.
You remember?
Okay.
I'll go and see what's keeping Mrs. Trumbull.
Okay.
Listen, Caroline said that the menus were all written in French.
Do you know how to read French?
Sure, I can read it.
Oh, good.
But I can't understand it.
Oh, great.
Well, listen, Ethel took French in high school and Fred was in France during the first world war.
Let's let them order and then we'll take what they take.
All right.
There's Mrs. Trumbull.
I'll let her in.
Good night, old man.
Say good night, papi.
Good night.
Say good night, honey.
Good night, boy.
Take your blanket.
Here we go.
Now, I want you to go right to sleep for Mrs. Trumbull.
You lie down now, honey.
You go right to sleep for Mrs. Trumbull.
That's a good boy.
What time'd they say they'd meet us here, Ethel?
Oh, they ought to be here any minute.
Well, I'm hungry.
So am I. Well, let's see what looks good.
Fred Yeah?
This menu's all written in French.
Well, what did you expect in a French restaurant?
But there's no English on it.
Let me see it.
There's English here.
Where?
Right here.
"Acme Printing Corporation, union shop.
" Oh, very funny.
Well, I ought to be able to figure out something on this thing.
After all, during the first world war "I was stationed in France.
" I know.
Well, I was.
You were there exactly three weeks.
Well, I learned a I I know everything you learned, and they don't serve "hinky dinky parley vous" here.
Well, I'll just ask the waiter to tell us what these things mean.
Hey, garcon.
Don't whistle!
I know what we'll do.
We'll wait till Ricky orders and then we'll say we'll have some of the same.
Well, what makes you think he can speak French?
Well, he speaks Spanish, and all those foreign languages are practically the same.
Oh.
Wouldn't you think I'd recognize something on this thing?
Oh, hi.
Oh, hi.
Oh, hi.
You're late, you know.
I'm sorry we're late.
Well, he was getting hungry, of course.
Oh, isn't this fun?
It's a real atmospheric type place, isn't it?
Yeah, I feel just like I was in Paris.
Ah, bonsoir, messieurs et mesdames.
Oh, bonsoir.
Bonswear.
Oh, gee, doesn't everything look delicious?
It certainly does.
What is madame's choice?
Uh oh, well, it certainly is difficult to make a choice.
Uh, what are you going to have, Fred?
Me?
Uh-huh.
Oh, I don't know.
What are you going to order, Rick?
Well, I thought I'd have this- Oh, I beg your pardon, ladies first.
Go ahead, Ethel.
Oh, uh, I haven't decided yet.
Lucy?
Oh, no, you don't.
I started this.
Well, now, is anyone ready to order?
Well, you go ahead, Fred.
You order first, Rick.
You order first, Luce You order You know, we could starve to death like this.
Now, someone has to go first.
I would gladly go first, but I have already eaten.
Oh, well, I know, I'll count.
One potato, two potato three potato, four Please, allow me- une pomme de terre deux pommes de terre, trois pommes de terre, quatre.
Cinq pommes de terre, six pommes de terre sept pommes de terre, c'est tout.
Ma mere m'a dit de prendre a vous.
Oh, well, that sounds good.
Bring four orders of that.
Madame, I was counting.
You must order first.
Oh Oh, well, uh, let's see now.
I'll have this.
That?
Yes.
I'll have the same.
Me, too.
So will I. Mesdames, messieurs You heard our order.
Will you please bring it?
Please, could I not suggest something else?
No, this is what we want.
Very well.
Four orders of "Closed on Sundays.
" Please, allow me.
I will bring you the specialite de la maison.
Un petit roti, des petits pois et quelque chose de pomme de terre frite.
Merci, monsieur.
Oh!
I was never so humiliated in my life.
That is the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me.
Aw, honey, you're 'zaggerating.
I am not "zaggerating.
" So we can't read French.
We're going to have a meal, aren't we.
That's right.
Who cares what they call it.
Yes, but suppose you want to order the same thing next time.
Well, I'll just wear the same tie and say, "Bring me some of this.
" Now, look, you can laugh all you want, but we are going to do something about this situation.
We are?
Yes.
We are going to take lessons and learn how to speak French.
Not me.
I had enough trouble learning how to speak English.
How about you, Fred?
Are you kidding?
Very well, Ethel, they'll be sorry.
People will say "How could those two charming, sophisticated cultured women ever marry those uncouth slobs"?
What does that mean, Fred?
Well, "slobs" means "Slobs" I know.
What does this "uncouth" mean?
Well, if you're uncouth, it means that that you're not couth.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Now, you listen to me.
You can get just as couth as you want, but just make sure that it doesn't cost me any money.
"Doesn't cost me any money.
Doesn't cost me any money.
" Ethel, did you ever take a good look into his eyes?
He has little dollar signs instead of pupils.
"Doesn't cost me any money.
"  Oh, it's you.
Well, that's a nice, friendly greeting.
I'll see you later.
Oh, come on in.
Don't be silly.
I was expecting our French teacher.
Our French teacher?
Our French teacher, and for free.
If you'd have been around this morning, you'd have known about it.
Oh, I had to go downtown.
How'd you do it?
How'd it happen?
Well, I got a brainstorm.
I called that French restaurant.
I thought maybe that waiter would be willing to give us lessons.
He said he would, and for nothing.
Oh, Lucy, that's wonderful.
Why should he teach us for nothing?
I don't know, and I didn't ask questions.
He'll be here any minute.
Well, I'll be right back.
You don't have to get fixed up, you know.
Fixed up?
Don't be silly.
I just want to tell Fred I'm home.
I'll be right back.
All right.
I wouldn't leave you alone in your apartment with a Frenchman who's going to give you lessons for nothing.
Oh, go on.
Silly.
Ah, bonjour, madame.
Bonjour to you too.
I'm Robert Dubois.
Well, how do you do.
Won't you come in?
Merci.
Is your husband home?
Now, just a minute.
Let's get one thing straight.
You came here to give me French lessons.
It doesn't matter whether my husband is home or not.
But you don't understand.
I understand perfectly.
Are you going to give me French lessons or not?
Oui, madame.
Very well, that's better.
Now, then, shall we start with the menu from the restaurant?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We will begin the lesson with a few simple words.
Repeat after me.
Yes?
Le crayon.
La crayawn.
Le crayon.
Le crayawn.
La plume.
La plooma.
La plume.
La plooooom.
La plume.
La plooooom.
La Oh, no.
Am I too late?
Yes, years too late.
Sit down.
Oh, you're kidding with that, aren't you?
Uh, you remember Mrs. Mertz, this is Robert Dubois.
How do you do?
Have you learned anything yet?
Oh, sure, it's simple.
La crayawn and, uh, la ploom.
Oh, that's wonderful.
What does it mean?
The pencil, the pen.
Do you think you could teach us enough French so that we could order in any French restaurant?
Absolument.
He says he can.
We were just starting with a few simple words.
The pencil.
Le crayon.
Uh, le crayawn.
Le crayawn.
La plume.
La ploom.
La plooooom.
La plooooom.
Up here.
Ploom.
La plooooom.
Ploom.
La plume.
La ploooooma.
Uh, la, el?
Le.
Le, uh, le crayawn.
La plooooom.
Bon.
Bon.
Bon.
No, "bon" means good.
Oh.
You are doing fine.
You speaking French very well.
Oh, yeah, we're in great shape if the restaurant we go to happens to serve pens and pencils.
We will begin our vocabulary slowly.
Table.
Table.
Table.
La table.
La tabluh.
La table.
La tabluh.
Let me try.
Okay.
La tabluh.
La table.
La tabluh.
'Bluh.
Cat.
What?
Cat.
Cat?
Cat.
Oh, cat, cat, yes.
Le chat.
Gee, French is a funny language.
Why are some of 'em le and some of 'em la?
You see, there is difference between French and English.
In French, everything, it is either masculine or feminine.
You Americans don't have that.
You haven't been in this country very long, have you?
Oh, Lucy, that's very funny.
Mrs. Ricardo, please.
What?
I do not know all the rules of grammar.
I am no teacher.
Oh, I know, I know, you're a waiter.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I am an entertainer.
An entertainer?
Oui, that is why when I found out who you were, I agreed to teach you for nothing.
I hope I could meet your husband and be in one of his shows.
What's French for sneaky waiter?
You never get anything for nothing in this world.
Oh, Lucy, this is really too bad, honestly.
There's strings attached to everything.
Free French lessons.
Please, do not be angry.
All I want is an introduction to your husband.
Just an introduction?
Oui.
Is that all you want?
Oui.
Well, okay, if you keep on giving us free French lessons, I will introduce you to my husband, but that's all.
Oui, madame, merci.
Merci, you are very kind.
Perhaps I could use my influence with Mr. Ricardo, too.
Merci.
Now we'll start to make a simple sentence.
Uh-huh.
"The pencil is on the table.
" Le crayon est sur la table.
Lay crayawn est soor la tabluh.
Lay crayawn est soor la tabluh.
Lucy!
Oh, mon husband, bonjour.
Are you still on that French kick?
I certainly am, and I took a lesson today.
And it didn't cost you a cent.
Okay, that's fine.
How did it go?
Uh, bon, mo'seer.
Uh, le crayawn est soor la tabluh.
Muy bien.
Uh, la maison est roosh.
Magnifico.
Gee, we sound so international.
Yeah.
Too bad we can't understand each other.
Yeah.
Who's your teacher?
Well, uh, the waiter from that French restaurant.
Oh?
He's coming over again tonight.
Another lesson so soon?
Well, not exactly.
No, he's coming over to see you.
Me?
What does he want with me?
Well, you see, he's really an entertainer from Paris- Paris, France, that is- and he thought if he could just get to talk to you, he might be able to get an audition at the club and possibly be in one of the shows.
Lucy.
Lucy He's-He's really a very what?
Lucy, there's one word that is exactly the same in Spanish in French and in English.
What's that?
No.
But Ricky, all you have to do He'll give us free French lessons if you just talk to him once.
Just talk, say hello, how do you do, anything.
What's wrong with that?
It wouldn't be fair to the guy, honey.
I couldn't possibly use a French singer at the club.
Why not?
A real French act at the club might be a good change of pace.
No, no, no.
Besides, French revues are very popular now.
They're all the rage- you know, Folies- Bergere type stuff and the cancan stuff and Moulin Rouge and Toulouse-Lautrec paintings all around and all that frilly stuff.
You know, as much as much as I hate to admit it, you might have something there.
Really?
Hi.
Hi, kids.
We were so dressed up, we decided to eat out again.
Listen, Ethel, guess what?
Ricky's going to star Robert Dubois in a French revue at the club, and we're all going to be in it.
We're all going to be in it?
!
Hey, hey, Ricky, we can do our apache dance we used to do.
Watch.
That's the part I like- where I hit him.
You should have seen us one night when we got mad.
We darn near killed each other.
Well, that's very clever, but don't call me and I won't call you.
Oh, Ricky, you're mean.
Okay, so I'm mean.
Now, come on, let's cut out all the auditions and let me see if I can figure out something about this French Come on, let's go, let's go.
Well, you don't have to go away mad.
I'm not mad, I'm hungry.
We'll see you later, honey.
Okay.
So long.
French revue That might not be bad, at that.
: Every little breeze seems to whisper Louise Birds in the trees seems to twitter Louise.
Yeah, might be all right at that.
Like Chevalier kind of stuff, yeah.
Every little breeze Seems to twitter Louise.
Birds Every little breeze seems to whisper Louise Every little breeze Seems to whisper Louise.
The birds in the trees They all twitter Louise Alors.
We seem to be overstocked on Maurice Chevaliers.
Oh, you characters.
He just walked in and played the piano, and I got the idea.
Every little breeze Seems to whisper Louise Uh, you're in the right place.
Uh, you remember my husband, Mr. Maurice Ricardo.
How do you do?
Enchante.
And Mr. And Mrs. Maurice Mertz.
Monsieur.
Bonjour, bonjour.
Bonjou Ah, Monsieur Ricardo, your wife say I may speak to you about appearing at your club.
Well, uh, yes, we'd be happy to give you an audition.
Could you come over tomorrow afternoon about 4:00?
Certainement, I will be there.
Merci.
Merci, madame, merci, monsieur.
Merci, merci.
Au revoir.
Au revoir.
Every little breeze seems to Bonjour.
Hey, you know, this idea of so many Chevaliers might be very funny.
We could all be in the same thing.
We could all wear the same costume.
We could sing Every little breeze Lucy!
What?
You don't seem to understand that I don't want you in the show.
Listen, Ricky, this whole French revue idea is mine, and if I can't be in it, you can't use it.
Okay, sue me.
Look, honey, you know I'll manage to sneak in anyway, so why don't you let me be in it right from the beginning?
Come on, Ricky, you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.
I'm going to save us all a lot of trouble.
I'm going to give orders down at the club that you're not going to be allowed in there for any reason at all.
You're not even going to be allowed to get into the building.
That'll take care of you.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I'll just bet you I can get in anyway.
You want to lose a little more money, eh?
How much would you like to bet?
You name it, buster.
$20?
Not very sure of yourself, are you?
$30?
Piker.
You got yourself a bet.
Okay.
Okay.
Every little breeze seems to whisper Louise The birds in the trees Let's take the dance.
We're going to rehearse that music in there.
One       Any sign of her yet?
No, sir, haven't seen her yet.
Well, it won't be long now.
Oh, here come the boys.
Come on, fellows.
You sure take a long time having dinner.
Como esta?
Thank you, thank you.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
The Tropicana takes great pleasure in presenting tonight our new French revue.
Amigos.

{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Yes, Caroline, that's right- a mink stole of my very own.
Ricky just told me.
Oh, isn't he a dream?
Oh, really?
He's the nicest, dearest, sweetest husband in the whole world.
Oh, naturally, it was very expensive, but Ricky says nothing's too good for his little wife.
Oh, well, I have to go now, Caroline.
I'll see you Thursday at the club meeting at Ethel's.
Good-bye, dear.
Lucy What?
Do you realize that that's the seventh person that you called telling them I'm gonna get you a mink stole?
Yeah, I know.
Lay off the phone, honey.
I'm waiting for a very important call.
Oh, all right.
Oh, baby!
Mmm!
Did I thank you properly?
Yes, but do it again.
You got the best thank-yous in town.
Mmm-mm!
You know, I wish you wouldn't  I wish you wouldn't make such a big point about how expensive it's gonna be.
After all, I'm getting it wholesale.
Shh!
No one's supposed to know that but you, me and the minks.
What's the difference who knows?
I want people to think you love me retail, not 40% off.
Ay-yi-yi.
Oh, I can't stand it!
A mink stole!
A m-i-n-k s-t-o-I-e of my very own!
Oh!
Hello, Marge?
Guess what Ricky's getting me.
A mink stole!
That's right!
I wonder what's keeping that guy.
Well, and when he told me he was going to give it to me, you have no idea, you know what he said?
Lucy!
Wel- ah!
Oh, uh, thanks for calling.
Thanks very much for calling, Marge.
Good-bye.
Hmm?
What are you going to do?
Call everybody in town?
But, Ricky, a mink stole, a mink stole!
I never had a mink stole before.
A mink to a woman is like I know, I know, but if I hear you say "mink stole" once more tonight, you're not gonna get it.
Understand?
All right.
But you can't stop me from thinking about it.
I wonder where this guy could be.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, Ethel!
Where have you been?
Downtown.
Guess what.
Ricky's getting me a m Oh, I'm not allowed to say it!
Guess what Ricky's getting me.
I haven't got time to play games.
I got to go get my dinner on.
No, no, wait a minute.
This is very important.
Ricky's giving me a present.
Yeah?
Yeah, well, guess what it is.
Okay, give me a hint.
Well, Ricky is giving me something- something that every woman has always wanted from her husband.
A divorce?
No.
It's something to wear.
What does this look like?
A diaper?
Oh Now, Ethel, be serious.
A shawl.
A necktie.
You be quiet!
Uh now watch.
A burglar?
A burglar.
Uh Ricky's giving you a burglar to wear around your neck?
No.
Uh now watch.
What's he doing?
Stealing?
Stealing.
Uh Steal?
Uh Uh Stole?
Uh, yeah!
Stole?
Oh, a stole!
Yes!
Uh, uh, uh Now, what kind of fur is it?
Fur?
Yeah.
Uh fox?
No, uh No?
Smaller than a fox?
Uh, yeah Rabbit?
Smaller than a rabbit?
A white rat stole?
No.
Come on, Ethel, think, think.
It rhymes with "think"!
"Think"?
Yeah!
Think think Yeah.
: Oh!
From Ricky?
Yes!
I don't believe it.
It's true, Ethel, it's true!
Ricky's giving me a-a A mink stole!
Yes, a real, honest-to-goodness what you said.
Oh!
Oh, Ricky, that's just wonderful.
Isn't that gonna cost a lot of money?
Well, as a matter of fact, I'm getting it Holy cow!
Oh, it's terribly expensive, Ethel, but you know how Ricky is.
Gee, can't you just see the girls when I wear it to the meeting Thursday?
Oh, they'll just die.
Oh!
Oh, that's the best news.
I got to go now and get my dinner on.
Okay.
Oh!
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, I'm sorry I kicked you, honey.
Sorry I kicked you so hard.
That was kind of stupid of me, especially right now, huh?
You're not mad, are you?
My father always said to me, "El que le da de comer al padre ajeno pierde la mano y pierde el pan.
" What does that mean?
Don't kick the shin that stoles you.
Oh!
Oh.
You're cute!
Here we go!
We say good night to Daddy.
Say good night to Daddy.
Good night, boy.
Say good night.
Say, "Good night, Daddy.
" Say, "Good " Oh, come on, say good night to Daddy.
Oh Well, honey, I guess he's just tired.
Sure, he's tired, Mama.
Yeah, you should have seen him today.
He was all over the place.
Really?
Yeah.
Want to walk a little bit for Daddy?
Oh, come on.
Show me how you can walk.
Here, take this.
Here, boy.
Come on, show Daddy how you can walk.
Here, come on over here.
Come on to Daddy.
Come on.
Come on.
Oh!
Isn't that wonderful?
Look at that boy.
Oh, that's wonderful!
Oh, that's wonderful, man.
Come on.
Say, "Nighty night, Poppy.
" He's a big boy.
Yeah.
Say nighty night.
Good night, Ricky.
Here, honey.
There we are.
Say good night.
Good night.
Wave bye-bye to Poppy.
Good night, sweetheart.
Wave bye-bye.
Wave bye-bye.
He's sleepy, Mommy.
Yeah, good night.
Good night, boy.
Well, our little man is sound asleep.
Good.
When's Mrs. Trumbull gonna get here?
Any minute.
You know, I always think it's so silly to have to get a baby-sitter to go across the hall to the Mertzes' to play canasta.
Well, the price is right: Nothing an hour, double for overtime.
Well, I guess it gives her something to do.
Yeah.
She's an awfully nice woman.
Yeah.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Sure.
What's on your mind?
Honey, we're gonna be there in a minute.
Shh!
Why don't you talk then?
Oh, well, yes, honey, it's your turn to have the club meeting this week.
Well, I don't know, Ethel.
The last two times it was your turn, I had it here.
Now, you can't have the club meeting here.
Shh, be quiet!
Well, besides, if I have it here, what excuse have I got to wear my mink stole?
No, I can't leave all the windows open.
Oh, I know, I know.
Well, maybe I can have it here.
No, you can't have it here.
Will you please be quiet?
Uh, yes, dear, I understand.
Lucy, I want to talk to you for a minute!
Shh!
Uh, all right, dear.
Uh, okay, I'll have it here.
All right.
What's the matter with you?
You crazy or something?
I told you, you can't have that meeting here.
I'm sorry, Ricky, but don't you know why Ethel never wants to have the meeting at her place?
Sure.
She's smart; she doesn't want to go through that mess.
No.
Because she's ashamed of her apartment.
She's ashamed of her apartment?
Yes.
Why?
Well, you know, the wallpaper is all stained and the furniture is so crummy.
Well, I'm sorry, but you can't have that meeting here.
Marco is coming over Thursday.
We're gonna work on arrangements all day long.
Now, you certainly can change that.
Besides, every time you have that meeting here, it takes you two days to get ready for it, two days to get over it, and the place is a mess while they're here.
It'd be simpler to paint the Mertzes' apartment.
Hey, that's a wonderful idea!
What?
Paint the Mertzes' apartment.
Now, wait a minute.
I didn't mean that lirally.
Well, I'm taking it lirally.
That is a sensational idea.
We'll have a painting party.
The four of us will paint the Mertzes' apartment.
We're not going to do any such thing.
Why not?
Look, Fred knows how to paint; it's his apartment; if he wants to fix it up, let him do it.
My father always says, "No te mete en adonde no te llaman.
" What does that mean?
Don't meddle in other people's business.
What did your father ever do but sit around and think up corny sayings?
Besides, it's not meddling.
If they don't want it painted, they can say so.
And if they do, you certainly can spend one afternoon helping our dearest, closest friends, can't you?
Well Then you will?
Okay, but All right, I'll go get Mrs. Trumbull.
I'll tell her to hurry, then we'll go right over and tell them.
I'm lily of the valley Of the quiet, peaceful valley over there And I'm lonely, oh, so lonely Fred, Lucy and Ricky will be here in a minute.
That's good.
Well, go change.
Change?
Well, you don't expect to stay dressed like that, do you?
Well, from the tone of your voice, I guess I don't.
Go on, get fixed up.
It's only the Ricardos.
It's the principle of the thing.
Go on!
And put on a necktie.
Necktie?
Yes, a necktie.
: Necktie?
I know, I know.
Ricardos are coming over, I got to get a necktie on.
Come in, come in.
Hi, girl.
Hi.
Hi, Ethel!
Where's Fred?
Where's Fred?
He'll be right out in a minute.
He's showering and dressing.
Fred Mertz!
Well, you didn't have to get all dressed up just for us.
Fred Mertz, you march right back in there No.
Now, wait a minute.
I have something to tell you.
What?
Well Come here, Fred.
Um Ethel, you know how your apartment is.
What do you mean?
Well, the way it looks.
Let's face it, it's sort of, uh Oh, what's the word I'm looking for?
I don't use that kind of language.
Yeah, well, Ricky and I thought it might be fun to have a painting party.
The four of us could paint your apartment.
A painting party?
Yes.
And paint this apartment?
Yeah.
Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
Well, wh-wh-what color do you think it ought to be?
Oh, let's see Who's gonna pay for the paint?
Well, there goes that idea.
Let's play canasta.
Well, those are things you got to find out.
How ungrateful can you be!
I wouldn't be surprised if they called the whole thing off now.
Why?
Because you just don't ask questions like that.
When they offer to give us a party, that obviously means that they supply everything.
That is, unless they've changed their minds after your rudeness.
Have you?
Uh No, we-we-we haven't, have we, Ricky?
No, no, no Oh, that's great!
That is a good idea, you know.
That's the best idea you've ever had, Lucy.
Let's see now, when we paint it, we ought to paint it some, uh Oh, uh, real some real bright color.
That's what it needs, a real bright color.
Orange would be nice.
Orange!
Orange!
Oh, don't be so silly.
For heaven's sake.
Then, after it's painted, all we'll have to do is buy new furniture and we'll have a whole completely redecorated apartment.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What's this about new furniture?
Well, after it's painted, we can't leave this ratty stuff in here.
It'll just show it up.
Sure.
Now, just a minute.
You're not gonna touch this chair.
You're not gonna touch that lamp.
Oh, no, let's don't lose that lamp.
No.
You're not gonna touch that table or that chair he's sitting in either.
Well, that only leaves the ashtrays.
Well, I don't care.
I- I just got this stuff broken in so it's comfortable.
Oh!
How can you say that, Fred?
Look at that chair.
It's all lumpy and sags in the wrong places.
So does Fred.
Never mind!
Well, if we're not gonna get new furniture, you can just forget all about the painting.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, come on, let's play canasta.
No, no.
Now, now, you listen, Fred.
Now you listen.
You're not gonna touch this furniture.
It's all stuffed with feathers.
Every bit of it.
Why-why, they don't make furniture like this anymore.
You can say that again.
Well, I've lived in this miserable rat's nest for 20 years.
I guess I can live in it for 20 more.
Oh, now, Ethel, we'll think of something.
I know.
How about?
How about you butting out for a change?
Well!
Aw, now, don't cry, honey bunch.
Don't you "honey bunch" me, you penny-pinching old goat!
Who's a penny-pinching old goat?
If the penny fits, pinch it!
Okay!
Que lo estoy diciendo por 13 anos que no te mete en They're still not speaking.
And the craziest thing of all- they're both mad at me.
No!
I just can't understand people.
Try to help them and they turn on you every time.
Well, I And don't say, "I told you so.
" Well, I did told you so.
I know, I know.
You told me, your father told me, everybody told me.
Why don't you admit that you were wrong to go there and butt in?
All right, I admit it- I made a boo-boo.
From now on, whatever they do is their own business.
I've learned my lesson.
I'm through.
Good.
Boy, this is a tough one.
What is?
Trying to figure out how to get Fred and Ethel back together again.
I give up.
What's the matter?
What were we just talking about?
And now you're getting ready to butt in again.
Just butt out, will you?
I can't go through life with a boo-boo on my record.
Besides, they're our dearest friends, and it's our fault that they're fighting.
Our fault?
Well, my fault.
And I know how to straighten it out, too.
Well, I'm not gonna listen.
Well, I'm gonna say it anyway.
Where's that magazine?
You see, if we do the painting and don't get the furniture, Ethel will be mad.
If we do get the furniture, Fred will be mad.
So, there's just one thing to do- paint the furniture and upholster the old furniture.
Did you hear me?
"Paint the furniture and upholster the old furniture"?
Yes.
You mean paint the apartment and upholster the old furniture?
Yes.
I didn't hear you.
Oh Now, look, I don't mean that we're going to have it done.
We're going to do it ourselves.
Do it ourselves?
Sure, there's an article in here; it's easy.
Look.
Here it is.
Now look at this.
Right here.
Who's going to pay for the material?
You sound more like Fred Mertz every day.
Now, look, Ricky, we've just got to do it.
We'll pay for the material.
Okay, but that means that your mink stole is going to be cut from here to here.
All right, if that's the way it has to be.
Come on.
But that's certainly hitting below where my mink belt used to be.
Come in.
Hello, Fred.
Oh, it's you.
What's that you're eating?
My breakfast.
A bottle of beer and a salami sandwich?
Well, it's the only thing I know how to cook.
Ethel has locked herself in the bedroom and won't come out.
Well, that's why we're here, Fred.
I have a plan that'll fix everything.
Please, from now on, your channel doesn't come in on my set.
He'll listen to you, Ricky.
You tell him I have a wonderful plan that won't cost him a cent.
My scatterbrained wife has another half-witted scheme, and if you listen to it, you're out of your mind.
Boy, did I suffer in that translation.
Well, what's the plan?
I want to tell you both together.
Did you lose something?
No, I didn't lose something.
What's your plan?
Well, we thought that we would paint the apartment and upholster the furniture ourselves.
We'd leave in all the lumps and sags and that way, everybody would be happy.
Hey, that's a good idea, isn't it, sweetie?
That sounds fine, honey bunch.
There's an article in Better Homes and Gardens here I want to show you.
I know how to do it.
Who's going to buy the material?
Okay, we'll buy the material.
Let's not  Well, I'm all through with my wall.
Oh, isn't it beautiful?
Hey, that didn't take very long at all, did it?
Uh-uh.
Well, not a bad job for a bunch of amateurs.
How are you doing, Lucy?
Fine.
I just got this little corner here.
That's good.
Uh-oh!
You missed a little spot right here.
Oh?
Oh, Ricky, you did a swell job on that woodwork.
Lucy!
What?
Oh, Fred, I'm sorry.
Oh, thank you, Lucy.
That's the most hair he's had on his head for 30 years.
Oh, I'm sorry, Fred.
Here, Fred.
You know, actually, we did pretty good not getting a lot of paint all over us.
Most people would have had paint all over them.
Sure.
Yeah, I'll say.
Oh, Lucy.
Well, so I'm enthusiastic.
But look at that paint job.
Isn't that a dilly?
I'll say, but I was right.
What?
The furniture looks worse.
Well, we're getting to that now.
That's next, the upholstering.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Sure.
We painted ourselves, didn't we?
Well, you did, anyway.
You know what I meant.
Go down in the apartment and get that material.
It's on the desk.
Okay.
Let me at this stale old chair.
I've been waiting for this.
Oh, no!
I can't stand to look at this.
It seems just like an old friend.
Oh, keep quiet, Fred.
: Aa-ah!
Tell me, did it suffer much?
Oh come on, do something useful.
Go open the window.
The paint smells awful in here.
All right.
I can't stand the smell of paint.
Hey, Fred, go get that electric fan we used last summer.
That'll clear all this paint smell out.
All right.
Now, don't plug it in here.
It's still wet there.
Well, I'll get a longer cord and plug it in the kitchen.
What's the matter with that?
Boy, he wasn't kidding about these feathers, was he?
Oh, Lucy, be awful careful.
They're just murder to sweep up.
I know.
I got to put them all up here.
Can I help you get that out of there?
Yeah, you do that.
Okay.
Aah ooh Oh, this tired old chair.
Am I glad to get this eyesore out of here!
Aah!
There.
We got to get these tacks out of here, you know?
How do you do that?
With a screwdriver.
Oh, okay.
And you be careful 'cause we have to use them again.
All right.
There, this ought to work fine.
Uh-oh, it must have caught on something.
This will do it all right, though.
Fred!
Fred!
Fred!
Go pull out the plug!
Fred!
Oh, my God, look at the place.
Oh, Fred!
Oh, no, look What happened?
Oh What happened?
!
Lucy, now look at the mess you made!
You've ruined our whole apartment!
I have?
Yes, you, this was your idea.
Now what are you going to do about it?
Hi, girl.
Hi.
Oh, boy doesn't our furniture look wonderful in here!
Uh-huh.
It was kind of rough on you and Ricky having to pay for all this, but I'm glad the way it turned out.
So am I, in a way.
You see, you got our old furniture, but I got to buy new furniture for our apartment.
And I get to hold the club meeting in my own, wonderful, newly furnished apartment!
Yeah.
My stuff came; you want to see it?
Mm-hmm.
Come on.
Okay.
There it is.
Isn't it beautiful?
Oh, Lucy, isn't that wonderful!
I think it's dreamy.
Oh!
Oh, everything turned out just wonderful- everything except Except what?
Well, I've been kind of afraid to ask you, but what happened to your mink stole?
We're sitting on it.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
I'm coming.
Did a man come in or anything like that?
Did you see anybody, did you see anybody on the fire escape?
Where?
Where?
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?
There's been a robbery in the neighborhood.
A robbery?
Well, get the police!
Get the police!
Oh, you're a police.
That's all right, Mrs., uh Mrs. Ricardo.
Mrs. Ricardo, did you see anyone?
No.
I was asleep.
Who else lives here?
Well, my-my husband- he's still working at the club, but my little baby is asleep in the nursery.
I'll check the premises.
Oh!
Oh, a robbery right here, right here in the building?
Oh, it just gives me goose pimples!
Well, gee, at least you've got Fred to protect you.
Protect me?
The minute he heard about it, he ran and hid.
I was not hiding.
I was looking for something to hit him with!
Under the bed?
Ooh, it was awful.
Lucy, I can't see wh-why you didn't wake up.
Officer, please don't wake up the baby.
Where was the robbery?
Well, let's see now  Ethel, where was it?
It was in the Ackermans' apartment across the street.
They came home and scared the burglar and he went down the fire escape.
No kidding?
Yeah, and then they saw him run across the street and right into this building!
Are you sure?
Oh, yes.
We've checked everywhere.
So I guess she's given us the slip again.
Oh, that's too She?
She?
Isn't it a man?
We think the person who's been pulling all these jobs in the neighborhood lately is a woman.
Oh, gracious alive!
What makes you think it's a woman?
We suspected it at first, but tonight the Ackermans' report clinched it.
How?
How?
How?
Just before entering this building, they saw the robber stop and take a hitch at her girdle.
Oh!
Have you any idea who she is?
No.
The only thing we've got to go on are fingerprints, but the boys on the force call her "Madame X." Madame X. Madame X. Oh, it gives me shivers.
How do you like that?
Well, uh, uh, thanks, folks, for your cooperation.
Oh, well, thank you, officer.
Look at that.
"Madame X strikes again.
"The mysterious woman burglar added another to her long list of robberies last night.
" Oh, boy, that's exciting.
It isn't every day we have a robbery and get our names in the paper.
What do you mean "our names in the paper?
Right here: "The police questioned all the tenants.
" That's us.
I'll cut it out and put it in my scrapbook.
Well, it is exciting.
Have you seen the News?
Have you seen the the Mirror?
Look at that.
Oh!
Oh, the News is more sensational.
Yeah, but the Mirror gives it more space.
Isn't it scary?
Fred Mertz, I want you to have new locks put on every door in this building.
A child could open the old ones.
I can't afford it.
I'll buy them.
With what?
Oh, I've managed to save a little out of that miserable pittance you give me.
Okay, then, buy the locks.
All right.
I was going to buy you a birthday present with that money.
Oh, fine.
Oh, Fred, I didn't know you had a birthday coming up.
When is it, Fred?
A week from Thursday.
Ah.
How old are you gonna be?
Did you hear about the big robbery last night?
Come on, Fred, don't be bashful.
How old are you?
Well, now, I'll make a deal.
I'll tell how old I am if you'll tell how old you are.
That was a big robbery we had last night.
Come on, birthday boy.
Let's go count how many locks we have to buy.
New door locks for Fred New door locks for Fred New door locks for  Gee, I'm glad we found out about Fred's birthday.
What will we get him?
How about some keys to go with the locks?
Seriously, we have to get him something nice.
Hey, I know!
A tweet soot.
A "tweet soot"?
Yeah.
He's always wanted a soot from my tailor's- a tweet one.
Oh, a tweed suit!
Oh, he'd love that.
Well, I tell you what.
I'll make an appointment for him to go to the tailor's today.
Oh, no, that's no fun.
Then it won't be a surprise.
Well, honey, they have to know his measurements.
They do?
They do unless you want to give him a tweet nightshirt.
Oh, dear.
Let's see Oh, why don't you get one of his old suits from Ethel, and then the tailors can get the measurements off of that.
No, she's such a blabbermouth, she'd tell him.
Well, I don't know how you're gonna get it, then.
I know.
I'll sneak in and get one of his old suits out of the closet without either one of them knowing it.
Be sure they don't catch you.
Well, I won't if you keep them busy.
Call them up and get them over here on some pretext.
Okay.
I'll get them over on some pretext.
What's a pretext?
Well, it's when you want someone to do something, but you don't want them to know that you want them to do that particular something.
So, you make up something else, then they think they're doing something else, but in reality, they're doing the something that you want them to do but don't want them to know that you want them to do.
What?
!
Look, I'll show you what I mean.
Oh, wait a minute.
Forget the pretext.
They're out around the building counting locks.
I'll go get it right now.
Okay.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Trumbull.
Uh, Mrs. Mertz, here is the check for my rent.
Oh, thanks.
My, we certainly had a lot of excitement around here last night, didn't we?
I'll say we did.
Are we alone?
Well, yes.
Fred is out in the kitchen, but he can't hear us.
Why?
Mrs. Mertz, I know something.
About the robbery?
Yes.
And I've got to tell somebody.
Oh, you can trust me, Mrs. Trumbull!
Well, I I may be wrong, but I think there's a chance that Madame X may be somebody who lives in our building.
In this building?
!
Shh!
What makes you think so?
Well, they say Madame X is a woman who wears men's clothes.
Yes, yes.
They saw her come in here and they didn't see her go out.
Yes.
Now, I know I'm wrong.
I know there's a logical explanation, but But what?
!
But what?
!
Well, I-I know I'm wrong, but I I I saw someone sneaking out of your apartment with a man's suit.
Who?
Lucy Ricardo.
Lucy?
Going out of this apartment?
Sneaking along the hall.
Oh, my goodness!
Lucy!
Oh, Mrs. Trum Oh, what are we saying?
I know there's a logical explanation, but what is it?
Oh, Mrs. Trumbull, I'm surprised at you.
Suspecting Lucy of all people.
Well, I said I knew I was wrong.
Well, I should say so.
Oh, I'm ashamed of the two of us just standing here talking like this.
Well, so am I. Just forget I ever mentioned it.
Oh, consider it forgotten.
Good-bye.
Fred!
Fred!
Fred!
Fred!
Fred, come here!
Come here!
What's the matter?
Guess who Madame X is!
Who?
Lucy!
Lucy who?
Lucy Ricardo.
And what's more, she's pulling all those jobs wearing your suit!
I've been waiting for this.
Your brain has gone bye-bye.
Oh, is that so?
Now, Mrs. Trumbull said she saw Lucy sneaking out of this apartment carrying one of your suits!
I don't believe it.
Well, I'll just look and see.
Aha!
Your gray suit is gone.
So she took one of my suits.
Ethel, there's a hundred reasons why Lucy could take one of my suits.
Name a few.
Well, it could have been bec Well, she might have had a So Lucy is Madame X!
Uh-huh.
Now, listen, we got to get ahold of ourselves.
We're standing here, accusing Lucy of being a crook!
I know it, I know it.
We've got to prove that Lucy is innocent for her sake and ours.
But how?
I know!
After Ricky goes to work tonight, we'll watch her and see what she does.
We'll go up on the roof and come down the fire escape and watch her through the window.
What will that prove?
Well, if she doesn't put on your suit and go out and come back later with a bag full of loot, then she isn't Madame X. That won't prove anything.
Even a crook has a night off.
Then we'll stay out there till we prove that Lucy is innocent.
All right.
Besides if she is Madame X, you and I better know about it.
Yeah.
What's she doing now?
She must be going to crack a safe tonight.
She's sandpapering the ends of her fingers.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
I was wrong.
She's using an emery board on her nails.
Come on, Sherlock, let's go back to headquarters and forget it.
Forget it?
We've only been here an hour.
I'm cold, I want to go home.
Well, go ahead.
Leave me your coat, will you?
Say, you are getting cold, sneezing like Here, put this on.
Put my hat on, too.
Now, don't hang around here too long!
I won't.
Just long enough to clear the name of my good friend, Madame X Uh, Lucy.
I'm sorry to wake you up, honey.
I'm going to take you over to Aunt Ethel's.
That might have been Madame X on the fire escape.
There she is.
I don't believe it.
Your Aunt Ethel is Madame X!
Here's your house money for the week, honey.
Now put it away.
Don't lose it.
Now, look, Lucy, you've got to stop even thinking that Ethel is Madame X. I know, but after what I saw What was she doing out there on that fire escape wearing a man's hat and coat?
Well, there must be a good reason for it.
I'd like nothing better than to find a good reason.
I've been thinking and thinking and I can't find one.
Well, now, you don't really think that Ethel is Madame X?
Of course not, but how can I prove it?
Well, why don't you just ask her about it?
Oh, sure.
What am I gonna say?
"Hi, Ethel, robbed any good apartments lately"?
You know what I mean.
Tell her that you saw her out on the fire escape.
Oh, I can't do that.
Why not?
If she's not Madame X, she'll tell why she was out there.
And if she is, she'll shoot me.
We got to be clever about this, Ricky.
What do the police do when they suspect someone?
Oh, well, they got a whole routine.
What kind of a routine?
Well, you know, they got, uh clues, fingerprints telltale evidences Fingerprints!
We'll try to get Ethel's fingerprints on something.
This silver cigarette case of yours would be just perfect.
Hello, Ethel.
Ethel, we were just wondering why we haven't Oh, Fred, I didn't recognize your voice.
Oh How are you?
Oh, we're fine.
Yeah, well, we were just sitting around, wondering why you haven't dropped over lately.
Yeah, well, why don't you come over?
Oh, good.
Bring the madame, uh, the missus Uh, Ethel, bring Ethel.
Oh, all right, bye.
They're coming right over.
This will just be perfect.
Now, let's see we can serve drinks, maybe get fingerprints on the glasses, too.
Okay, I'll make some lemonade or something.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Just serve two drinks.
Just two?
Yeah.
Now, we won't touch a thing.
That way, all the fingerprints will be theirs.
Okay.
Don't forget now.
Now, keep your eyes peeled for clues while we're over there.
Hey, if you could get Lucy to choke you, we'd have her fingerprints on your neck.
Hey, that's a good idea.
Yeah, I like it.
I don't mean the choking part.
We'll try and get her fingerprints on something.
All right.
Now, while we're over there, we won't touch a thing, and any fingerprints will be theirs.
All right, come on, let's go.
Hi, Ethel, Fred!
Come on in.
Hello, honey.
Come in and sit down, won't you?
Hi.
Hello, Lucy.
Good to see you.
I bet you were wondering why I asked you over here tonight.
Well, yes.
Oh Uh, I have something I want to show you.
What?
Here, take it.
I can see it.
It's that cigarette case that, uh, Ricky got for Christmas last year.
Oh, you've seen it before, huh?
Yeah.
Oh.
You want to see it again?
No.
Oh.
Uh uh, look inside.
You haven't seen the inscription, have you?
You mean the one that says, uh, "Merry Christmas to the boss from the boys, 1952"?
Yeah, that's the one.
Yeah, I've seen it.
Uh, you know, this is pure silver.
Isn't it amazing how heavy silver is?
Here, lift it.
I know, it weighs a ton.
That's the reason Ricky never carries it.
Yeah yeah.
Well  Hello, folks!
Oh, hi.
Oh, hi, Rick.
Put the drinks right down there, dear.
Okay.
Oh, just a minute.
Just a minute.
Uh, oh.
Okay.
There you are.
Have one, Fred.
No, thanks.
Go ahead, help yourself, Ethel.
No, thanks, I'm on a diet.
Oh, on a diet.
Why, you don't have to reduce.
If anything, I'd say you were underweight.
Have you been to an oculist lately?
Oh, keep quiet.
Come on, Ethel.
Have one, come on.
Here.
No, I'm not thirsty, anyway.
Oh well Oh, don't let that keep you from having one, honey.
You have one.
Oh, all right.
Hand it to me, will you, dear?
Uh-huh.
No, thanks, I changed my mind, I Uh, oh, uh, let's have some peanuts.
Dear, they're right there on the mantel.
Oh, okay.
Here.
Oh, thanks.
I'd like some.
All right.
Oh, just a minute.
Uh, here, hand this to Fred, dear.
All right.
Thanks.
Well, come on, Fred, let's go.
All right.
Oh, don't go.
Oh, honey, I've got a hundred things to do.
Oh, that's too bad.
I didn't Oh, we may come later.
We might come up later.
Oh, well, I hope so.
Bye-bye.
Thanks.
Bye.
See you later now, if you can.
Darn it!
Did you see how slippery she was?
She deliberately kept from putting her fingers on anything.
Yeah.
How about that, huh?
Mm Hmm.
How about that?
I got them!
I got them!
I got her fingerprints!
Where did you get them?
On that silver cigarette case.
Oh, pretty slick, huh?
Now, all I got to do is take this down to the police station and compare these with Madame X's Ha, ha!
I'll go get my coat on.
All right.
Fred!
Don't touch that cigarette case.
I don't want any fingerprints on that but Lucy's.
Now, let's see.
I think I got good, clear prints.
Hey, she's cleverer than I thought.
She handled that with her bare hands and didn't leave a print on it.
Yeah, how about that?
Honey, I'm late for the club already.
I'll see you later.
Ricky, have you got your sil-silver cigarette case?
No.
Why?
Well, I left it right here someplace, and I just can't underst Ethel swiped your cigarette case.
She really is Madame X. Oh, come on, now.
Yes!
Now, we got to do something about this.
I don't know what you're gonna do, but I got to go.
Good night, honey.
Listen, Ricky, now, I got an idea.
I'm gonna call Ethel and I'm gonna tell her that I'm gonna the baby over to Mrs. Trumbull's apartment, and then I'm going to the club with you tonight.
Why?
Well, that way, she'll think the apartment is empty an-and if she wants to really rob it, she can.
And th-then I'll hide in here, an-and I'll catch her red-handed.
And maybe I can talk her out of this life of crime.
Oh, now, look, honey, why don't you get a good book, go to bed and forget all these crazy schemes?
They're not crazy schemes.
Yes, they are.
Now, good night, dear.
Good night, dear.
Hello, Ethel.
Uh, Ethel, in case you were thinking of dropping over again tonight, I just wanted you to know that we wouldn't be home.
Ethel, not my good silver!
You know that belongs to Ricky's mother!
Put that gun away!
Put that away!
What do you want to do, hurt somebody?
Now stop that!
The i the idea!
I'm surprised at you!
Trying to rob our apartment!
Why, Ethel Mertz!
I have never heard of such a thing before.
You You should be ashamed of yourself.
Ethel, now, you This is not the life for you.
If it's money you need, I'll pay you what I owe you.
You give up this life of crime, and I won't tell a soul that you're Madame X. Lucy.
What?
!
What's the matter?
I got Madame Whoops!
Madame X!
That's Madame X!
Oh, Lucy!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, Lucy!
What's the matter?
No, no, it isn't Lucy.
The real Madame X got away.
Which way did she go?
She went that way.
This way?
Yeah.
Sure?
Yeah.
Oh!
Ethel, Ethel!
Huh?
Let go of my neck.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh Oh, dear.
Oh Oh, Lucy I'm so relieved to know that that was the real Madame X and not you.
Me, too.
Gee, Ethel, I'm sorry.
What do you mean that I wasn't Madame X?
I thought you were.
I was?
How did you get that idea?
Where did you get the idea I was?
Mrs. Trumbull says she saw you sneaking out of our apartment, carrying one of Fred's suits.
Oh, that was for a model.
Ricky was going to give your Fred a suit for his birthday.
Oh, dear.
What were you doing out on our fire escape, wearing a man's hat and coat?
I was spying on you.
I thought you were Madame X and Fred and I went out on the fire escape and I got cold and he gave me his coat and hat.
Oh, no.
I got her!
Honey, I got Ethel!
I got Ethel!
Ethel!
I got her!
I got her, honey!
We got her!
I got her!
I got her!
Did you see how I got her there?
Yeah, I saw you.
I caught her right there.
I caught her myself!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Yes, Jerry.
Yes, I know.
I know it's awful tough to find publicity these days, but that's what I'm paying you for, remember?
Now, listen to me.
I want a story about me in the papers next week or else.
Yes, I got an idea.
I got a wonderful idea.
How about "Ricky Ricardo Shoots Publicity Agent"?
Okay.
Well, look, let's see that it gets in there, huh?
Thanks.
Good-bye.
Ay, que barbaridad!
No se lo que lo pasa a la gente.
Se le pago muchisimo dinero para publicidad y no le hace nada.
What's the matter, dear?
Oh, that Jerry.
You know, when you pay somebody to do something, you expect them to do it.
I practically have to do the whole thing for him.
Now calm down.
You'll forget your troubles at the movies.
What are we going to see?
Oh, that picture we've been trying to get to for weeks, with Marilyn Monroe.
Yeah, that might make me forget my troubles.
Yeah, well, the Mertzes will be here any minute.
Hurry up.
Hurry up and what?
Get dressed.
I'm dressed.
Well, honey, I've been working around the house all day long.
You don't 'spect me to change just to go to a neighborhood movie.
Ricky Ricardo, do you mean you'd actually go to a movie in that awful shirt and those horrible, old pants?
Marilyn won't mind.
Besides, this is my best pair of blue jins.
They may be your best blue "jins," but they're disgraceful.
And that shirt, it looks like it came out of the rag bag.
It did.
I had an awful time finding it.
Must have gotten there by mistake.
That was no mistake.
I'm not stepping out of this house with you in that outfit.
Aw, now, look, honey, if we were going to go dancing or something, I'd say you had a point, but who's going to see me?
We're going to walk two blocks down to the theater, sit in a dark movie and walk back.
Suppose we have an accident.
Ay-yi-yi.
Suppose a car hits you, and you're knocked unconscious.
You stretched out in those horrible, old clothes.
How's that going to look on the front page?
Oh, brother!
Now, look, Lucy Are you going to change or are we staying home?
Okay, I'll change.
Thank you.
Boy, the things I do for Marilyn Monroe.
What shall I wear?
My tails or my tartan dinner jacket?
Just a suit and a tie, and don't be so terribly amusing.
Now go on.
Yes, ma'am.
Hi.
Hi, girl.
Where's Fred?
He's coming.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Ricky will take a few minutes.
He's changing his clothes.
Honestly, Ethel, you should see the beat-up old clothes he wanted to wear.
You couldn't imagine anybody would want to go out looking like that.
Oh, yes, I could.
I don't know how you got Ricky to change.
I couldn't do a thing with Raggedy Andy.
What's the matter with these clothes?
They're comfortable.
Fred, if you wanted to be comfortable, I'm surprised you didn't go in your pajamas and bathrobe.
Ah.
Oh, no, you don't.
Fred, Ricky is wearing a suit, a shirt and a tie.
Now, how are you gonna feel?
Comfortable.
It's no use, Lucy.
You're beating your head against a stone slob.
Yeah.
Ricky!
I'll be there in a minute.
Honestly, I don't know what's taking so long.
I guess he's having trouble getting those old jeans off without breaking them.
He's really attached to those pants, isn't he?
Sometimes I think it's vice versa.
You know, he doesn't hang them up in a closet, he stands them up in the corner.
Okay, I'm ready.
Come on, I'll get Mrs. Trumbull.
Just a minute!
Is he going to go that way?
Now, Ricky, it doesn't matter what Fred does.
Come on.
Well Come on, Little Lord Fauntleroy.
That does it!
Now, Ricky!
Nobody's going to call me Little Fraunterooey!
Oh Oh, and wasn't that a wonderful dress she had on in the big number?
Oh, yeah.
Gee, I hadn't been to movies for so long, I'd forgotten how fattening they are.
Yep, once you start on that popcorn, you're dead.
Too bad they don't make silent popcorn.
I never heard a word of dialogue.
Me neither.
Any sign of them yet?
Yeah, here they come.
Are they still doing it?
No.
They probably stopped the minute we got out of sight.
Imagine walking along and poking in trash cans and shouting, "Any old bones, bottles or rags"!
I I could just kill those two sometimes.
Well, we started it, walking along ahead of them, pretending not to know them.
Well, they deserved it.
Ethel, we are going to have to do something about this.
Now, Lucy, you're not getting another idea, are you?
Yes, I am.
How long do you think those two tramps will go on wearing those old clothes?
Until they're condemned by the Board of Health.
Exactly.
Or until they're worn so thin that you can see through them and they get arrested.
No, we are going to have to save them from that terrible fate and do away with all their old clothes.
Oh, no, Lucy, they'd murder us.
It's the only way to keep from going through life with Rag Pickers, Incorporated.
Well, what do we have to do?
Oh, you should have seen the look on your face.
Well, I didn't expect it.
What's the matter?
Did you get arrested for vagrancy?
Almost.
What?
Well, we were standing in the corner, just talking And I took my hat off to scratch my head And a woman dropped a dime in it.
Hi.
How you doing?
Fine.
You got all of Fred's old clothes?
Yep.
I took everything that wasn't fit to wear out of his closet, and you know what?
What?
The closet's empty.
Listen, Ricky hasn't thrown anything away since before he came to this country.
You wouldn't believe how old some of this stuff is.
No matter how old it is, Fred's is older.
Oh, no.
Look at this.
Universidad de la Habana.
Well?
Ha!
You win.
Well, I'll call the secondhand man, tell him to come and get this stuff.
Lucy, I'm worried.
So am I. I'm worried he may refuse them.
No, I don't mean that.
Do you think we really ought to do this?
Listen, Ricky's been promising me for ages he'd get rid of this stuff.
Well, so has Fred.
Well, we're just helping them keep their promise in a painless sort of way.
Do you think they'll believe our story?
Certainly, it's the best story I ever made up.
Now, what could be more logical?
We decided that if they wanted to wear their old clothes, we would clean them.
So, we soaked them in gasoline.
They just happened to get a little close to the stove and burned up.
They'd never suspect the truth.
Why not?
They'd never think we had the nerve to sell their old clothes.
I hope you're right.
Here's one- Allen's Used Clothing Emporium.
All right, now I want to take this number with everything- the spotlight, I want to try the microphone, the whole works- just like it was tonight.
From the top, everybody.
Granada Tierra sonaba por mi Mi cantar se vuelve gitano cuando es para ti Mi cantar, hecho de fantasia Mi cantar, lo de la melancolia Que yo te vengo a dar.
Granada tierra ensangrentadas en tardes de toro Mujer que conserva el embrujo de los ojos moros De sueno rebelde y gitana cubierta de flores Y beso tu boca de grana Jugosa manzana que me habla de amor Granada manola cantada en coplas preciosas No tengo otra cosa que darte que un ramo de rosas De rosas de suave fragancia Que le dieran marco a la virgen morena Granada Tu tierra esta llena de lindas mujeres De sangre y de sol.
OlÃ©!
Okay, boys, we'll take the last few bars in a couple of minutes.
Just take a little rest.
Hello.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Ricardo, please.
This is Mr. Ricardo.
This is Zeb Allen, Allen's Used Clothes Emporium.
Who?
What?
I thought you might be interested to know that I just got in a hot shipment of old clothes.
Look, you must have the wrong Ricardo.
This is Ricky Ricardo.
I know it.
Well, what makes you think that I'd be interested in old clothes?
Because they're yours.
What?
They're mine?
!
Yes, sir.
I just came from your house.
Your wife was throwing old clothes out of the front door faster than I could pick them up.
Looked like an explosion at the laundry.
I don't believe it.
Well, I'll tell you what I've got here.
Here's one plaid flannel shirt- blue and gray, soft and comfortable-looking and not quite through at the elbows.
No.
Then there's a sweater here with a big "H" on the front of it and some foreign writing on the back.
Oh, no.
Now, uh, how would you like to get these clothes back?
Oh, I-I sure would.
Now, listen, you'll make a profit on the deal, don't worry.
Don't you worry.
What?
Well, buying men's old clothes from their wives is a tidy little business, but I make my real money selling them back to the husbands.
Ah, I see.
Well, okay, I'll come down.
Where are you?
Third Avenue and 32nd Street.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Ricky Mi mujer me ha hecho lo peor que nunca me ha hecho a mi.
Â¿Que paso?
Lucy me vendio toda mi ropa vieja.
Que barbaridad.
Mira, que tiene vender la ropa Hey, Rick, Ethel sold all my old clothes to a secondhand man.
Lucy tambien la vendio toda mi ropa mia a Allen's Used Clothing Emporium alli.
That's the place.
Â¿Tu sabes?
Me vendio la camisa de flanela mia que estaba un poquito aqui por los codos pero estaba bueno todavia y el sueter mio que tenia la "H" de la Universidad de Habana me lo vendio.
She even sold the sweater I won in the Golden Gloves.
Ay-yi-yi.
Â¿Mira que son sin verguenza, eh?
You can say that again.
Hmm!
I'm going over there and get mine back.
Esperate que voy contigo.
Adios, Alberto.
Adios, Ricky.
Adios, Fred.
Come on, friend.
Hey, wait, Rick!
What do you know about that?
I've been talking Spanish.
Come on.
Let's get over there and get this stuff.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What?
I got an idea.
I'll go get our clothes back.
You go to a good clothing store, you know, and get some, uh empty suit boxes.
What for?
To put our old clothes in.
Our old clothes?
Yeah.
I don't get it.
You will.
Here's what we do, look Honey, I'm home!
Well, darling, how's my Cuban dynamo?
Fine.
Oh, Brooks Brothers!
Ricky, you bought some new clothes.
Yep, I bought them, all right.
Oh, well, that's just wonderful.
Sort of a coincidence, too.
Coincidence?
Yes, uh, because I have some dreadful news to tell you about your old clothes.
Oh, really?
What is that?
Well, uh, today, I got feeling guilty about last night.
After all, if you want to wear comfortable, old clothes, I should let you, so long as they're clean.
Yes.
And Ethel felt the same way about Fred's, too, so we got out all your old clothes and started to clean them.
Oh, that was very nice.
Yes.
Uh, well, uh, you know how easily gasoline catches fire.
Oh, you didn't use gasoline?
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
I goofed.
Uh somehow or other, they got too close to the stove, and the first thing I knew Poof!
All your clothes burst into flame.
Oh, my goodness!
And Fred's, too.
Fred's, too?
!
Uh-huh.
All that was left was just some little old ashes.
Just ashes.
Worn-out ashes.
I guess you're pretty upset, huh, honey?
No, no.
You know, it's one of those things that can happen to anybody.
Aw, Ricky, you're so understanding.
It's so wonderful to be married to such a sweet, kind and understanding man.
Thank you.
Uh I'd like to show you what I bought now, okay?
Okay.
Eww Well, what do you think?
They sure did a good job of sewing those ashes back together.
Lucy, I bought these from a man.
A man named Allen.
Well, what luck, finding a set of clothes just like the ones that burned.
Yeah, how about that?
Yeah, well, too bad we haven't got the other set.
We could sort of dress alike in father and mother bum suits.
I am not amused.
No, I didn't think you would be.
And furdermore "Furdermore," what?
Furthermore, I don't want you to ever give away, sell or get rid of my old clothes without my permission.
Yes, sir.
Imagine selling this swell shirt.
Hi, Rick!
Hiya, Fred!
How do you like my shirt, huh?
Oh, that's real snappy.
How do you like this sweater?
Oh, that's dandy, boy, that's beautiful.
You won't believe it.
Only this morning this thing was in a terrible fire.
Is that so?
Yeah.
Oh, my!
What are you gonna do?
All right, in a couple of minutes, we'll take that big mambo number, huh?
Well, Ricky, I got to be going.
Oh, stick around, Fred.
I've been here most of the afternoon.
Ethel says if I keep hanging around your rehearsal, you'll have to put me on the payroll.
Well, wait till we do the big mambo number.
You mean the one with the gals in it?
Yeah.
Okay.
Only this time I'm only rehearsing the orchestra.
On second thought, I've got to get out of here.
Hi, Ricky.
Oh, hi, Jerry.
Hi, Jerry.
I got great news.
Publicity, I hope.
Oh, yes, sir.
I have just arranged to have you named one of the ten best-dressed men in our country.
What?
You're gonna get an award for being one of the ten best-dressed men in our nation.
One of the ten  Oh, no!
Wait, what's so funny?
I thought you'd be pleased.
: One of the ten best-dressed I heard him.
All right, so it's not the Academy Award.
I don't think it's that funny.
I'm sorry, Jerry.
It's just that our wives have been riding us because they don't like the way we dress.
Oh, oh, that's it.
Well, now listen, here's what's gonna to happen.
Tonight just before the show, some big shots are gonna come down to present you with the award and take some pictures, okay?
Wonderful.
Oh, Lucy will die when she finds out.
So will Ethel.
Oh, gee, Fred, I wish there was some way that I could get you on that list.
Hey, now, wait a minute, Ricky.
I know I'm a good publicity man, but I'm not that good.
Well!
Hey, I know what.
I can tell them that Fred is my fashion consultant.
Him?
Me?
Yeah.
Why not?
Well, I suppose it'd be all right.
Okay, I'll be back here at 7:00 tonight with the photographer.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay.
See you later, boys.
So long, Jerry.
Hey, let's call the girls and tell them, huh?
Yeah.
Gosh, it'd be great if we could surprise them.
That's a wonderful idea!
What is?
You know, sometimes I think you're much brighter than you look.
What did I say?
Come on, now, let me in on it.
We'll surprise the girls.
You mean wait and let them read it in the papers?
No, no, no.
We'll ask them to come down here and have dinner with us tonight.
We won't tell them what for.
And then we'll just watch their faces as they see us accept the award.
Good.
That's the best idea I ever had.
Yeah.
We'll sit in our play pen for a while, that's what we'll do.
Sit down and play with that big bug.
Mama answers the telephone.
Sit down there and play with that.
Play with it.
Hello.
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi, darling.
Listen, how would you and Ethel like to come down and have dinner with Fred and me tonight?
Oh, gee, I have dinner on the stove.
Well, take it off.
We'll have it for breakfast.
Spaghetti?
Oh well, it'll keep.
What's the occasion?
Nothing.
We just, uh, we just thought it'd be nice.
Well, gee, I don't know if I can get Mrs. Trumbull to take care of the baby.
Oh, sure, you can.
Well, come on.
What's it all about?
Nothing, honey.
Lucy, can I have a cup of sugar?
Wait a minute.
Ethel's here.
You want to go downtown and have dinner with the boys?
Yes.
What boys?
Fred and Ricky.
Oh yeah.
All right, dear.
Now, listen, you get all dolled up and be here at 7:00 tonight, okay?
Fine.
I'll see you later.
All right, dear.
Bye.
Bye.
What's the occasion?
I don't know.
He says it's nothing, but he wants us to get all dolled up, so it must be something special.
Let's don't take any chances.
I'll wear my blue crepe.
What are you gonna wear?
Lucy?
Hmm?
What are you gonna wear?
Ethel, how much courage have you got?
None.
Come on, now, I've got an idea.
No, no, I'm a coward.
I can't even wear purple 'cause it clashes with the stripe down my back.
Now, Ethel, you haven't even heard the idea yet.
I don't want to hear it.
Let this be one idea that you keep a secret.
Just keep a Ethel, listen to me.
This is one time we can get even with these characters.
Now, sit down, girl.
Listen to me Does that do it, Bill?
Well, I'd like one with the wives in it.
Well, they'll be here any minute.
Can you wait?
Sure.
I'll get some more flashbulbs.
And I want to talk This is a wonderful thing.
Fred!
Ricky!

Who are these people?
I don't know, sir, but I'll take care of them.
Now, now, look here, my good men, I don't know how you got in here, but you have to leave.

After we got all dressed up for dinner?
Why, certainly, these are good movie clothes, they must be good dinner clothes.
Now, look, I'll give you a dime for a cup of coffee.
Now scram.
Come on.
Could you give me a dollar for a cup of coffee?
I'm a big tipper.

{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
All right, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.
Listen, I don't know, I think that something in there doesn't sound right.
Will you play it alone, Alberto?
Okay.
Sounds all right now.
I guess it's me.
We'll take it over in a couple of minutes.
Hello.
Hi, dear.
Oh, hello, honey.
How are you, dear?
Do you still have your headache?
Yeah, I still have it.
Oh I wish I knew what was causing it.
Oh, haven't you got any idea?
Could it be something down there at the club?
No.
No.
Everything is real peaceful down here.
Oh, you know what I think?
I think it's your eyes.
Aah Don't "aah" me now, Ricky.
You promise me you'll go and have your eyes examined.
Oh, honey, I got a lot of work to do.
Now, Ricky, you promise me.
All right, all right.
All right, dear, bye-bye.
Good-bye.
Ricky!
Bill Parker!
Hiya.
Good to see you.
How are you, boy?
Glad to see you.
I read in Variety that you were in town.
You going to produce a Broadway show, huh?
Yes.
Till the pictures make up their mind, I'm going back to the theater.
Well, good.
Say, uh are you going to let me try for the lead?
Well, I would, Ricky, but you're not exactly the type for an English professor.
Oh, you mean my accent?
Yeah.
Oh, that's a phony.
Sure you know, people think that I really talk this way, but I dun't.
You "dun't," huh?
No Well, I'll keep you in mind.
Okay.
Say, uh, I have a little problem.
The theater that I've been using for my auditions has been taken over by a TV show.
You suppose I could use your club for just a couple of days?
Why, sure, Bill, anything you want at all.
Hey, how about having dinner with us tonight?
Wonderful!
Like to meet your wife.
That's right, you haven't met Lucy, have you?
Not yet.
Okay, I'll call her.
You know, it'll be a pleasure to spend an evening with some folks who aren't trying to audition for my show.
Uh-oh.
What's the matter?
Uh, look, uh if you want to spend a real pleasant evening, I'd better introduce you as Bill Parker, an old friend of mine, and not mention anything about your connections with show business.
Has your wife got aspirations?
No, no, she's feeling all right.
It's, uh just that sh-she wants to get in show business.
I see.
Well, I'll call her and tell her that you're just an old friend of mine.
Now, we won't say what kind of business you're in.
Okay, Ricky.
Lucy, have you seen Fred?
No, honey, I haven't.
Listen, I want to ask you something.
Uh, Lucy, have you seen Ethel?
Oh, there you are.
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?
I've been looking Oh, now, wait a minute.
You found each other.
Now go on from there.
What do you want?
I want you to tell you to be sure and sandpaper that new bannister you put in before some idiot runs his hand down and picks up a splinter.
What did you want?
I was wondering if you'd help me get this splinter out of my hand.
Oh, fine.
Come on.
Hey, Ethel, wait a minute, I want to know if I can borrow your big roaster.
Sure.
You having company?
Well, Ricky said he was bringing home an old pal, a Bill Parker.
I wonder if that could be William Parker?
You mean the William Parker?
Well, he said his name was Bill.
Who's William Parker?
"Who's William Parker"?
"Who's William Parker"?
Where's your Variety?
Yeah, where's the Va Right there.
Oh, there was something about him right there today, wasn't there?
Yes Yes, there it is, there it is.
"Who's William Parker"?
Read this.
This?
Yeah.
"Parker preps prod for Pitt prem.
" "Parker preps prod for Pitt prem prem.
" Well?
Who's William Parker?
Well, the headline is a little confusing, but read the article.
"William Parker"- that much I understand- "William Parker, formerly legit prod, currently top pic exec seeks thesps for flesh tuner.
" Oh Ethel, come here.
: Who's William Parker?
Oh.
Oh, that's Variety talk.
They have their own way of saying things, see?
That's for sure.
"Parker preps prod for Pitt prem.
" Mm-hmm.
That means "Parker prepares production for Pittsburgh premiere.
" No kidding?
Uh-huh.
And the rest of it means that he's a big shot from pictures who is auditioning for a musical that he's going to produce.
And he's coming here to dinner!
Well, gather round, friends, we have plans to make.
I'm ready.
What time is it, dear?
It's a quarter to.
Well, they ought to be here any minute.
Now, remember, we're gonna make it seem real casual and natural.
Are you sure you can get rid of Ricky?
You just leave that to me, girl.
Here we are, Bill.
Well, hi, everybody.
Hi, dear.
Bill, I want you to meet my wife, Lucy.
How do you do, Mr. Parker?
How do you do?
Bill Parker.
Very nice to know you.
And this is Mr. and Mrs. Mertz.
Bill Parker.
Hello, Mr. Parker.
How do you do?
Fred and Ethel will stay for dinner, dear.
Oh, that's good.
Fine.
Sit down, Bill.
Make yourself at home.
Here, give it to me.
Sit right here, Mr. Parker.
Thank you.
Uh, what did the eye doctor say, dear?
Oh, I forgot.
Oh, now, you didn't.
Will you promise me you'll go tomorrow?
Okay, dear, I will.
He's been having splitting headaches.
Oh?
Listen, dear, would you do me a great, big favor and run down to the corner drugstore and get me some ice cream?
Oh, we don't have to have ice cream.
Oh, please, now, dear, I didn't have time to make any dessert, Mr. Parker.
Please, dear?
All right.
Will you excuse me?
He'll be right back.
Listen, dear, get me a quart of vanilla and have them pack it in that special packing Vanilla?
Yes, honey.
In that special packing.
There's no business like show business Like no business I know Everything about it is appealing Everything the traffic will allow Nowhere can you get that happy feeling When you are stealing that extra bow.
There's no people like show people They smile when they are low Even with a turkey that you know will fold You may get stranded out in the cold But you wouldn't change it for a stack of gold Let's go on with the show.
There's no business like show business Like no business I know  Everything about it is appealing Everything the traffic will allow Nowhere can you get that happy feeling  When you are stealing that extra bow.
There's no people like show people Like no Oh How did you get back so quickly, dear?
Mrs. Benson gave me some ice cream from her freezer.
Oh.
I'm sorry, Bill.
That's all right, Ricky.
How did you find out who I was?
Oh, we know who's who in show business, Mr. Parker.
We know all about you prepping for your Pitt prem.
Looks like Variety double-crossed me.
Are you mad, sir?
No.
Oh, well, that's good because we haven't finished yet.
You sit down now, Ricky, and you can see the you can see the last of our act.
I've seen the last of your act.
Oh, now, honey.
That isn't fair!
Well, I suppose that you call it fair to send me out on a wild-duck chase for some ice cream that you don't need just so you can audition behind my back.
Is that what you call fair?
Goose.
What?
Wild-goose chase.
I don't care what kind of a chase you call it.
Well You know what I'm talking about.
Look, kids, I got an idea.
I'll make a deal with you.
If it's all right with Ricky, let me forget business for tonight, huh?
And tomorrow, tomorrow you can all come down and audition for me.
How's that?
Oh, Ricky, did you hear what he said, huh?
Huh, Ricky, huh?
Okay.
I guess it's Bill's business if he wants to waste his time on you.
Oh, that's great!
Oh Mr. Parker, what kind of a show are you doing?
Well, it's a college musical.
It's called The Professor and the Co-ed.
Say, you folks, you would be wonderful for the alumni scene.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Parker.
Oh, well, what can I do?
Can you dance?
Can I dance!
Can you jitterbug?
Can I jitterbug!
Can you put dinner on the table?
Can I put dinner on Oh, yeah.
Lucy.
Yeah?
Have you still got that hat you wore when you did the Charleston down at the club?
Yeah.
You want it?
Yeah.
We're doing the varsity drag for our number- you know, wear those Fred's digging stuff out of his costume trunk.
Oh, that sounds wonderful.
Gee, I hope my jitterbug number comes off all right.
Do you know how to jitterbug?
Well, I will as soon as my teacher gets here.
You can't learn jitterbugging from a teacher.
It's something you pick up in school, like measles.
Well, all I know is, Ricky's agent said he was sending somebody down here that could teach me how to jitterbug.
That's all I know.
I think that thing is in here.
Yeah, here it is.
Yeah  Ain't I the cat's pajamas?
Oh, you're the snake's hips.
Let me see how I look in it.
Be my guest.
That's a real razzmatazz, isn't it?
Oh, I feel just like a flapper again.
Well, call me a taxi!
Oh, that must be my teacher.
Will you open the door for him?
Yeah.
I'm looking for Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, I'm Mrs. Ricardo.
Crazy, baby!
Pardon?
I'm Arthur "King Cat" Walsh.
Oh, how do you do?
This is my friend, Mrs. Mertz.
This is "King Cat" Walsh.
How do you do?
Man, what's the chick got on her head?
Oh, that's a hat like flappers used to wear.
Man, that's cool!
Well, thanks.
I think.
Do you think you could teach me how to jitterbug?
Hang on, baby, here we go!
Oh!

Coolest?
Man, it's the hottest!
You got some strange cats around here!
Yeah.
Come on, Ethel.
Let's us cats creep on out of here.
You don't think you're gonna wear that big, heavy, old coat doing the varsity drag, do you?
That coat's a gasser!
Uh, yeah, well I have a record here.
I hope it's all right.
Uh, let's see now.
Is that all right?
Frantic, man, frantic!
Let's drag it, baby!

"Pretty good"?
Say, Dad, this cat's real nervous!
Oh, man, you're the craziest!
And you're a gasser!
You're the mostest!
Hmm!
And people say I'm hard to understand.
Mr. Parker, can we be in your show?
Can we, can we?
And what about us?
Yeah, can you use our act?
Give us the message, man!
Yeah.
Well, I don't know.
Ricky, is there any way I can arrange to see them work in front of an audience?
Nope.
Oh, Ricky, why can't we work right here tonight?
No, sir.
First up, Daddy-O, give us the real reason!
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on, Rick, what's the harm?
Come on.
Come on.
You heard what the man said.
He said we could dance up a storm.
He thinks we're real wiggy, man.
Yeah.
Now, look, wait a minute.
First place, I'm not running an amateur night in here.
And in the second place, you're starting to give me a headache again.
Oh, Rick, come on, now.
Ricky, just Didn't you go to see the eye doctor?
No.
Oh, Ricky, now you're gonna go right this minute.
Come on.
Now wait a minute.
What about our act?
Do we get to go on tonight?
Yeah, Ricky, what about Let's put them on tonight.
I'd like to get audience reaction.
All right, Bill, if that's what you want.
We'll put them on.
Oh, that's fine!
Yes, great.
Oh, thank you.
Now open wide.
Wider.
Wider.
Oh, Grandma, what big eyes you have.
Oh, Lucy, you're making me nervous.
Now sit down.
Oh, all right.
Now look up.
Now look down.
Uh-huh.
Now follow my finger, please.
All right, watch it carefully.
Uh-huh.
Well, how is it, Doc?
Oh, I haven't completed my examination yet.
Oh.
Would you please turn and face the wall?
Yes, sir.
Now, do you see that chart?
What's so funny?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was just thinking about a television show I saw the other night, and the eye doctor said to the patient, "Do you see that chart"?
And the patient said, "What chart"?
And and the doctor said, "The chart on the wall.
" And the patient said, "What wall"?
How are his eyes, Doctor?
Could you read the first line, please?
"E".
That's right.
Oh.
Next line, please.
"F, P." Could you read the fourth line, please?
"L, P, E, D." Oh, Ricky.
You see, it is your eyes, darling.
That's a "B," not an "E".
Looks like an "E" to me.
Read the next line, please.
"P, E, C, F, D." "P, E, C, F, D"!
Oh, my poor baby.
What's the matter?
That isn't "P, E, C, F, D".
That's "F, E, O, P, B".
That's "P, E, C, F, D"!
Ah, well, this is just the stubbornest man in the world, Doctor.
Go ahead, tell him how bad his eyes really are.
Mr. Ricardo, your eyes are perfectly normal.
You see, darling, you wouldn't believe me What?
!
I said your husband's vision was perfectly normal.
Well, how can you say that?
What about that line?
He said it was "P, E, C, F, D." Anybody can see that it's "P, E, C, F " Eww.
" D." That'll be all for you, Mr. Ricardo.
Thank you, sir.
Come here, Mrs. Ricardo.
Me?
Come here.
No.
Come on.
No, I don't wanna.
Come on, Lucy.
Do what the doctor says.
Come here.
What's the matter, can't you see the chair?
Yes, I can see the chair.
What are you going to do?
I just want to have a look at your eyes.
You don't have to worry about your eyes, Mr. Ricardo.
Just stop working so hard and those headaches will disappear.
Oh, thank you, Doctor.
Listen, honey, I got to go down to the club, so I'll see you later.
All right, bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Doctor.
Good-bye.
What did you put in my eyes?
Oh, just some drops to relax them.
They'll take effect in about 20 minute Oh, my goodness.
What's the matter?
What?
I've never known those drops to work so quickly before.
You must be very sensitive to them.
Really?
Oh, yes.
Your vision will be quite blurred for several hours.
Oh, no, no!
It can't be!
I have to dance tonight.
You got to take the drops out.
Get them out!
You can't squeeze them out, Mrs. Ricardo.
But you have nothing to worry about.
Here, here, look at me.
Look at me.
Now, your vision won't be any more blurred than I look right now.
Oh, no!
Hi, Lucy, what did the doctor say?
Oh, Ethel, gee.
Guess what happened You'll never know what Hey, what's the matter with you?
What?
Ethel, what happened?
Where are you?
I'm over here, Miss Magoo.
Oh.
Oh, Ethel, guess what happened.
What's the matter?
Ricky's eyes were all right, but the doctor said he wanted to examine mine and the first thing I knew, he put drops in them.
You mean he dilated them?
Yeah, and I-I'm just hoping that I'll be able to dance tonight.
Oh, you'd better cancel it.
Oh, but Ethel, I can't, I can't!
There's nothing else to do.
But-but-but I've worked so hard on my number.
I've just got to do it.
No, you'd better cancel it.
Ethel, I can't, I just can't.
Listen Oh, Ethel.
I don't know how you're gonna dance if you can't see.
Listen, listen, I'm going in to change my clothes, and you take me down there in a taxi.
Here, here, here.
This way.
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you and good evening.

Bill, take a bow there.
Thank you, Bill.
Well, Bill asked me to let a couple of acts that he's going to, uh, perhaps use in the show, he wants them to try out here tonight.
So, first of all, we're going to bring to you two people that are going to be part of the alumni, and they're playing the part of the alumni that comes back from the homcomming homcoming Well, that's as close as I can get to that one.

{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
More coffee, Fred?
No, thanks.
Ethel?
Uh-uh.
How about you, dear?
No, no.
I got enough.
Have another piece of cake, Fred.
Nope.
Ricky?
Uh-uh.
Oh, gee, this is the first time I've had to relax all day.
What'll we do tonight?
Oh, I don't know.
What's on television?
Fight night!
Oh, no, you don't.
Just sit down.
Sit down.
I've looked at so many fights on television, I've got cauliflower eyes.
Come on, now, we're four grown people.
Let's entertain ourselves.
Okay.
Okay.
Um Oh, come now.
Surely we can think of something to entertain ourselves.
Oh, stop that.
How about playing some cards?
No, we can't.
Little Ricky ate the queen of spades.
Oh Besides, I'd like to think of something a little more intellectual.
I know, we'll take a quiz.
A quiz?
Yeah, it's all about husbands and wives.
Oh, no.
You know what those are, Fred.
: "How to rate your marriage, or is your spouse a louse"?
Don't laugh at him, Ethel.
Now, here it is.
It's called Well, doesn't matter what it's called.
Now, I'll keep score.
Now, just a minute.
Let us in on it.
What is it called?
"How to rate your marriage, or is your spouse a louse"?
You read it, you louse!
No, I'm sorry, but I didn't read it.
Go ahead.
Oh, let's see now, I'll keep score, and at the end, we'll add them all up and see if each of us is married to our perfect mate.
For this, I need a quiz?
All right, now, first question.
Uh, Do you tell your troubles to your married partner?
Ethel?
Yes.
Fred?
Well, I try to spare her all I can.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Put down "yes" for the king of the bellyachers.
And "yes" for Ricky, and "yes" for Lucy.
Now, wait a minute.
Don't put down "yes" for me.
You have no idea of all the problems I have.
I don't tell you my troubles.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I thought all those troubles you brought home were yours.
"No" for Ricky.
Now, next question.
"Do you tell your husband or wife how much you pay for your clothes"?
Ethel?
Well?
It's been so long since I bought any, I forgot.
Put down "yes.
" Fred?
Yeah.
Ricky?
Of course.
Now, next question.
Have you told your husband?
Wait a minute.
What's the matter?
The quiz mistress neglected to ask herself the last question.
Oh, I did?
Yeah.
The question was: Do you tell your husband how much you pay for your clothes?
That's right.
Now, the next question Uh-uh-uh.
All right, one "no" for Lucy.
Uh-huh.
Now, the next question.
Have you told your husband or wife all about your past romances?
Well, if I told Fred Ricky?
Me?
It's Ethel's turn first.
Yeah, well, I thought I'd break the monotony by asking you first.
Besides, I can't wait to hear your answers.
Have you told me all about your past romances?
Well, now, let me see.
Uh Well?
Wait a minute.
Eh, yeah, I told you everything, yep.
"Yes" for Ricky.
Well, if I told Fred Now, for me.
Let's see.
Have I told you about my old romances?
I told you about going with the captain of the football team, didn't I?
Yes, a hundred times.
Then there was that lifeguard who was so crazy about me.
Yes, you bared your soul to me about him, too.
Yes, well, besides those, there were just a few big flaming romances that I've had.
Let's see.
Billy, Maury, Jess and Jerry, Bob and Bennett and George and Phil Martin and Danny, Argyle and Bud and Wilbur and Noble and Carl Frank and Henry- that was in high school- Uh, then in junior college, there was Johnny and Kenny Okay, okay, okay.
Well, I was only trying to be honest and make sure I had told you about everybody, dear.
I sensed that.
Well, now I can put down "yes" with a very clear conscience.
Now, uh, Ethel?
Well, if I told Fred all about Hey, uh, have I ever told you about Carlota Romero?
Who?
Carlota Romero.
No.
Who's she?
Oh, I didn't tell you about her, huh?
No.
Oh.
Just a girl I used to go with in Cuba.
Oh.
Now, I told you I can keep my "yes" answer and be honest about it.
Yeah.
Ethel?
Well Why haven't you told me about her before?
Oh, I don't know.
No particular reason.
It just slipped my mind.
Oh.
Was it a big romance?
Well, you know just one of those thins.
Just one of those "thins".
Well, come on, Ethel.
What are you waiting for?
I've forgotten the question.
The question is: Have you told your husband or?
Just one of those what "thins"?
Come on, now, Lucy, it's my turn.
There's just no point in going on with this quiz.
It's very obvious that one of us has so many secrets from his mate, he couldn't possibly be happily married.
I am, too.
Well, I'm not.
Oh, honey, you're getting upset over nothing.
If it was nothing, why didn't you tell me about it before?
Well, because there is no Carlota Romero.
I just made it up.
Ha!
Would you join me in your apartment, Ethel?
Oh, honey, you're being silly.
I'm not speaking to you.
Oh, now, Lucy, he's trying to get even because you mentioned all those boys' names.
Wow!
She's really burned.
I think you'd have been better off telling her about that dame.
I did, I told her the truth.
I told her I made it up.
There's no Carlota Romero.
Well, Lucy doesn't believe you, so what are you going to do about her?
Oh, gee, I don't know.
I didn't expect her to get that mad.
I was just teasing her.
You know, we've been married for 12 years, and I still can't figure her out.
I bet sometimes you wish you had made her up.
Well, she'll get over it.
Yeah, Ethel will look after her.
Come on, let's, let's look at the fights.
Okay.
Maybe it's time for the main event.
Here we go, honey.
Eat a great big breakfast.
Aw, come on.
Eat a great big breakfast.
Aw, come on, honey, come on.
Come on.
What's the matter, boy?
Hi.
Hello, son.
What's the matter?
What are you crying about?
Don't answer him, Ricky.
I don't want you associating with a man of his reputation.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Now, listen, honey.
In fact, Neither of us are going to talk to him until he explains his lurid past.
Hi, Rick.
Oh, hi, Fred.
Boy, you're the sly one.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
I just saw the morning paper.
Look, I got enough troubles without playing games.
What's up?
You remember that, uh, gal you made up, uh, Carlota Romero?
Yeah.
Well, you did a pretty good job.
She's appearing in town this week.
What?
!
"What"?
Right here in the paper.
Look at that.
"Carlota Romero, Cuban singing star "opened her first American engagement at the Opal Room.
" Oh, no!
Not bad.
I'll say this for you, when you make them up, you don't do badly.
You know, I must have seen her name in Variety or Billboard, and it got stuck in my mind.
Yeah, well, when Lucy sees that picture, she'll knock it loose.
Ay-ay-ay.
Now, look.
Fred, ta-ta-ta-take this paper home with you, huh?
I've already got a copy.
I know, you got a copy, but take it home with you.
I don't want Lucy won't see it.
I'm still trying to convince her that I made it up.
Oh, well, all right.
Ee Oh, what a tangled web we weave.
Huh?
That's an old saying.
"Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.
" What does that mean?
Well, it means that, uh Well, I'll have it translated in Spanish and bring it back to you.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi, girl.
Well, you're in a better mood than I expected you to be.
Oh, you mean about what happened last night?
Well I'll give Ricky a bad time for a while, but I believed him when he said he made up that Carlota Romero business.
Well, how did he explain this morning's paper?
Why, what about it?
Uh-oh.
What about it?
Um, nothing, nothing.
Come on, Ethel, what's in the paper you don't want me to see?
Uh, uh, well, uh, I didn't want to be the one to tell you, but, uh But what?
Uh, Daddy Warbucks has left Little Orphan Annie again.
Oh, Ethel, let me see that paper.
It's on the back page.
"Carlota Romero, Cuban singing star, "opens her first American engagement at the Opal Room.
" Oh, now Now, Lucy, pull yourself together.
It says in the paper, she's never been in America, so Ricky couldn't have seen her for Well, she's here now.
I'll bet they're planning to stir up those old embers again.
Be kind of hard to stir embers into a flame after 15 years.
She doesn't look like her pilot light would ever go out.
Oh, let me see that.
Oh, forget it.
You got nothing to worry about.
She couldn't take Ricky away from you.
Why, you're twice as pretty as she is.
You really think so?
Certainly, and you got twice as good a figure.
I have?
Mmm-hmmm.
Oh, I wish I could stand and carry myself the way you do.
It's absolutely regal.
Frankly, I can't understand why you were never chosen Miss America.
Oh, thank you, Ethel.
Well, I I guess I don't have anything to worry about.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What happened?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Lucy, what's the matter?
That's that's for running off with that castanet-clacker, you big Cuban heel!
Are you crazy or something?
!
Lucy!
Lucy, what's the matter with you?
What's the matter?
I dreamed you left me for Carlota Romero.
Oh, for goodness' sakes.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard in my whole life.
I'm not so sure.
She's right here in town, as if you didn't know.
Now, listen to me, I made that name up.
Or at least I-I-I-I thought I made the name up.
I must have read it someplace or something without noticing because this morning when, when Fred came over and and here was this girl's picture in the paper and then, and here I-I didn't even know this girl and-and here I made the same name up.
Isn't that a funny coincidence, huh?
No?
Who are you trying to kid?
Look, if You big two-timing button-giver!
Button-giver?
What does that mean?
Never mind.
You going to tell me the truth or aren't you?
Now, look, honey, if you don't believe me, why don't you call her up and ask her?
I'll just do that.
Okay.
Okay!
O- kay.
Huh, gee.
And don't do that no more!
Hi.
Oh, hi, dear.
What's going on?
Company tonight.
Oh?
Who?
Ethel and Fred and Jerry and Carlota.
Who?
Carlota.
Carlota Romero.
You remember her.
Why did you ask her over for?
Because I wanted to see you two together.
Jerry called her up and set the whole thing up for me.
Fine agent I got.
Mira, que tiene de mal la mujer aqui en la casaa que ni la conozco.
And if you're going to mumble, please have the decency to mumble in English.
Here she is.
Hi.
Oh, it's only the Mertzes.
Well, thanks.
You know, that's getting to be our first name: "Mr. And Mrs. Only-The-Mertzes.
" I'm sorry, dear, won't you come in and sit down?
Hi, Rick.
Hi, Ethel.
Oh, food.
Hiya, Fred.
Hi.
Now, Fred, leave those alone!
They're for company.
Well, what am I?
Don't answer that.
Hi.
Oh, it's only Jerry.
Well!
Everybody's got the same first name these days.
Thanks, Lucy.
Hi, Ethel, Fred.
Hi, Jerry.
Jerry, how are you?
Hi, Jerry.
Where's Carlota?
Oh, she told me on the telephone, she had to go on an interview and she'd meet me up here.
Good, the sooner, the better.
Oh, yeah, and Ricky, she said can hardly wait to see you again.
That's nice.
What?
Aha!
Now, Lucy, it isn't true.
Never mind!
Now, Jerry, what are you talking about?
I never saw this girl before in my whole life.
Well, sure you did.
She told me on the phone she worked with you in a nightclub in Havana, oh, about She was part of a singing act.
They called themselves the Five Romero Sisters.
Oh, for goodness' sakes.
Which one of them?
Well, now, how should I know?
Anyway, she was very surprised to hear that you remembered her, see?
And, oh, she said be sure and don't to expect her to look exactly like she did in the picture in the paper because that was taken, oh, about 17 years ago.
There she is now.
Ricky, I'm Carlota!
Hey, wait a minute, I'm not Ricky.
Ricky!
Nope.
Ricky!
Yes, hello, Carlota.
How are you?
Glad to see you.
This is Mr. and Mrs. Mertz.
Oh, hello, Carlota.
This is my agent, Jerry.
How you doing?
Well, it's nice to see you.
What have you been doing since I last saw you?
Putting on weight mostly.
Well, you look fine.
Was that Carlota?
Yes.
Where is she?
Oh, Lucy, I'd like you to meet someone.
Oh.
This is Carlota Romero.
Oh, how do you?
Carlota Romer Well, am I glad to see you!
Hello, Lucy.
Oh, my, you will never know.
I am so glad to see you.
Come over here and sit down.
This is quite a welcome.
I'm surprised that Ricky would even remember me.
Well, my dear, he will never forget you.
That's nice.
I guess I look a little different than you expected, don't I?
Well, uh, yes, yes.
I didn't expect anyone so pretty and charming and so full of well, so full of Uh Well, so full.
Tell, me, Carlota, how long are you going to be in town?
We must    Oh, look!

I'm not wearing a pillow.
Come on, let's open all our presents.
All right.
Okay.

{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
More meat loaf, anybody?
No, thanks.
No, thank you, honey.
Ethel?
Oh, I might as well finish up that last little dab.
Potatoes?
No, thanks.
Uh-uh.
Ethel?
Just another taste.
I hate to see food go to waste.
Salad?
No, thanks.
I couldn't eat another bite, honey.
Mm-mmm-mmm.
Sometimes, I feel like I was married to a garbage disposal.
Oh, leave her alone, Fred.
So she's got a good appetite.
Sure, she's just a growing girl.
Yeah, but she's growing sideways.
Quiet, fat boy.
Lucy, this is the best salad dressing I ever tasted.
Well, thank you very much.
Well, now, for once, you're right.
Why don't you buy a bottle of that stuff, Ethel?
Oh, you can't buy it.
I made it myself, Fred.
You know, you ought to bottle that, Lucy, and sell it.
Oh, Fred!
Well, I mean it.
I bet you could make a lot of money.
Money, money Where did I hear that word today?
Oh, yes, the teller at the bank called me and said that someone's account was overdrawn.
Uh dessert, anyone?
Uh Guess who the teller said was overdrawn, Lucy.
Uh, aren't these delicious-looking pastries?
They're real gooey.
I'll, uh, I'll give you a hint: He says it's someone who shares my joint account, but it's not me.
Go on, Lucy, guess.
Please, not while I'm eating.
All right.
Not while you're eating.
Cake, Ethel?
I don't know where I'd put it.
Just drop it into the bottomless pit.
Are you finished eating?
No, no, I'm not finished yet.
I'll wait.
These are very good.
Made fresh today.
Finished?
Nope.
I never can seem to get enough of these.
Are you finished now?
Yeah.
Now, would you mind telling me why you were overdrawn at the bank?
Every month, I put money in the bank and every month, you spend it all and more besides.
I don't understand it.
I mean, I'd like to know the reason.
Now, why are you overdrawn at the bank?
Lucy?
Eww Well, how'd things go after we left last night?
Pretty rough, huh?
It was the biggest battle of the budget yet.
We thrashed out every item in my books.
It was just terrible, Ethel.
I've used up my allowance until June Oh, that's not bad.
June 12, 1978?
Oh well, money isn't everything.
Yeah, with me, it isn't anything.
Gee, I wish I could invent something that would be worth a million dollars.
You sound just like Fred Mertz.
Fred?
Yeah.
Ever since we've been married, he's been trying to think up one idea worth a million dollars.
None of his ideas any good, huh?
Oh, he had some good ideas, but somebody always got to the patent office first.
He's still mad at Edison for beating him to the electric light.
And he's never forgiven Ford for scooping him with the horseless carriage.
Well, at least, he was trying.
I haven't even got an idea.
Ethel, I've got it!
Got what?
I know how to make a million dollars.
How?
Remember last night when Fred was raving about my salad dressing?
Yeah.
Well, he's right.
I'm gonna bottle it and put it on the market.
Bottle it and sell it.
Yeah!
It's the best salad dressing I ever tasted.
We can make it right here in the kitchen.
Will you help me?
Sure.
It's a real simple recipe.
I have it right here.
Let's see.
Here it is.
There now.
Let me see.
Let's see now.
What'll we call it?
My Aunt Martha gave it to me.
I suppose we really ought to call it "Aunt Martha's Salad Dressing.
" Sure.
It needs more than that, though.
How about "Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad dressing"?
Yeah, and we'll make it with old-fashioneds.
No.
We'll sell more of it.
Oh, come on, now, be serious.
How are people gonna know that we're selling it?
Now, we've got to advertise.
Yeah.
Gee, isn't it too bad we haven't got money enough to go on television?
Yeah.
Television!
We'll go on television.
Huh?
I'll be a cooking expert.
No, no, you'll be the cooking expert, and-and I'll be one of those women that they get up from the audience.
I know just how they act.
I've watched them a hundred times.
So have I. I watch them every day.
That's great.
I know just what to do.
What'll we use for money?
What do we need with money?
After all, who is my dearest friend in the whole wide world?
Caroline Appleby.
Caroline Appleby?
Sine when did she get to be your dearest friend?
Since I just remembered that her husband runs a television station.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Do you think she'll go for the idea?
I think so, especially if we cut her in to the tune of, say, three cents a bottle.
Yeah, she likes that kind of music.
Yeah.
All she's got to do is get us on that Dickie Davis Show.
He's on four hours every day and he sells all sorts of things.
The Dickie Davis Show, yeah.
Gee, I hope she'll do it.
Just show her money and she'll do anything.
She is the greediest, the penny-pinchingest Caroline, darling, how are you, dear?
Why, this is your old chum, Lucy.
Thank you, thank you.
That last number was brought to you by the Nelson Photo Finishing Company located on the corner of Leed Boulevard and Hickox Avenue.
Remember, the slogan of the Nelson Photo Finishing Company is "our business is developing.
" Oh, that's pretty clever: "Our business is developing.
"  Well, that brings us to a brand-new sponsor.
It is now my pleasure to present to you Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing and here to tell you all about it is one of the country's leading home economists Mary Margaret McMertz.
Good afternoon, homemakers.
I am Mary Margaret McMertz, and today I have a wonderful surprise for you.
For years, only a few close friends and relatives knew the thrill of eating salad made with Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing, but Aunt Martha- sweet, loveable, kind, old lady that she is- has finally consented to let the world in on her secret, and today you can buy a quart of real, honest-to-goodness, genuine Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing for only 40 cents a quart.
Simply write to: Or call: Oh, pardon me.
I did.
And place your order.
Now, in order to get an unbiased opinion on this product- for after all, they're paying me to do this- just before we went on the air, I picked an average housewife at random from our audience and asked her to help me.
Would you come up here, average housewife whom I picked at random from our audience?
Yes, you dear.
Right up those stairs.
You, dear.
Hello, dear.
Hello.
I'm Mary Margaret McMertz.
Oh, how do you do?
And, uh, what is your name?
Hmm?
What is your name?
Uh Isabella Clump.
Oh.
Mrs. Clump.
Yeah.
Have you ever heard of Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing?
Aunt-who's old-what salad-which?
You see, friends, she's never heard of it.
No, I never heard of it.
Now, I want you to try this salad dressing and tell these people what you think Mrs. Clump.
What?
I want you to try this salad dressing and tell these people what you think of it.
Oh, all right.
Pour it on the salad.
Oh.
That's it.
Now, toss the salad.
Just mix it.
Okay.
That's enough, dear.
Now let me have these.
Yeah.
Now, taste it.
Oh.
All right.
Mmm  Well?
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm Mmm mmm Well?
Mmm Mmm, mmm, mmm Well, Mrs. Clump?
Don't bother me.
This is the best salad dressing I've ever eaten.
There you are.
The opinion of an average housewife picked at random from our audience.
Mmm You will feel the same way once you try Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing at only 40 cents a quart.
Simply call: Circle 7-2099 or write to: and place your order.
Until tomorrow, good-bye, then.
You can relax, girls.
You're off the air.
Oh.
Oh, how'd we'd do?
Oh, wonderful.
You've already got Oh, 23 orders!
23!
Oh, no kidding!
a hundred and forty-four, a hundred and forty-four a hundred and forty-five a hundred and forty-six a hundred and forty-six.
There- the salt's all in.
That takes care of the oil.
Gee, if I get any more of this stuff on me, I'll be ready to swim the channel.
What do we do next?
Peel the onions.
Peel the onions.
Say, Lucy What?
Where'd you get the money to buy all this stuff?
Charged it.
Charged it?
What's Ricky gonna say?
Nothing- we'll have the money back before the bills come in.
Oh, of course.
Gee, isn't it wonderful?
We only started in business yesterday and already we got orders for 23 quarts.
Yeah, and no telling how many more the mail will bring.
Gee, this is a real get-rich-quick scheme.
I'll say.
Ooh.
Just think, in no time at all, we're gonna be millionaires.
Oh, that'll be lovely.
Yeah.
What are you going to do with your first million?
I'm going to go right out and buy myself a mink coat.
So am I. Then I'm going to buy myself a house in the country with a swimming pool and tennis court and horses.
Oh, boy.
Oh, that'll be nice.
You know what I'm going to do?
What?
I'm going downtown and buy that bank and fire that teller.
That'll be great.
Yeah.
We're going to be so happy.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi, Ricky.
Hi, darling.
Lucy, Ethel, what's the matter?
What do you mean, what's the matter?
What are you crying for?
Crying?
Oh, it's the onions.
Oh	 Oh.
Say, what's all this?
Welcome to the main plant of Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing, Incorporated.
What?
!
Ethel and I are in business.
We are bottling that good salad dressing I make.
Ay, que barbaridad.
Mira que no saben lo que estan haciendo.
That's not true, whatever you said.
We're going to make a million dollars.
Well, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my whole life.
Why?
There's lots of wonderful salad dressing in the market made by people that know what they're doing.
Well, we know what we're doing.
I should say!
We've already got orders for 23 jars.
At 40 cents a quart.
Yes, sir.
That sounds awful cheap.
How much does it cost to make?
Oh uh um Oh, um Well, we didn't figure that.
Oh, I see.
Well, what did you figure?
Well, we figured you'd just buy the oil and the onions and stuff, and-and sell it and what's left over is profit.
Uh-huh, and what if there's nothing left over?
Well, there's got to be something left over.
How else can we make a million dollars?
Wait a minute.
Now wait a minute.
Now let's figure this thing out.
How-how much did you pay for all this stuff?
All of it?
Yeah, all the stuff.
Come on.
Well, $7.21 for the groceries.
$7.21.
Yeah.
For the groceries.
And $1.20 for the jars.
$1.20 For the jars.
Ten cents for the labels.
Ten cents for the labels.
That's, um   $8.31  and um how many jars are you making?
Twenty-three.
: 23 jars.
and, uh and you're selling it for what?
: 23 jars, 40 cents a quart.
Oh, now, get these onions out of here!
For goodness' sake.
Now, let me see now.
That's, uh uh-huh.
How much profit are we going to make?
Three cents a jar.
Three cents a jar?
That three cents goes to Caroline.
Yeah.
Well, uh maybe there is no profit on each individual jar, but we'll make it up in volume.
This I'd like to see.
And let me tell you something else.
What?
I didn't figure shipping, mailing, insurance, taxes or overhead.
Oh, well, if you're gonna figure all that stuff.
Lucy.
What?
Come here.
No.
Look, I'm not gonna get mad.
You're not?
No.
Well, all right.
Now, at least you tried.
Yes.
Now, the thing for you to do is fill this 23 orders and get out of business.
Well That way, I'll only lose seven or eight dollars.
Yeah.
Lucy!
Ethel!
Yeah?
We're in here, Fred.
I got your mail.
Okay.
What's that?
That's your morning mail.
The morning mail?
You're kidding!
"Send me one quart of Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing.
" "Send me one quart of Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned " "Send me one quart of Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned " "Send me two quarts of "  "Send me four quarts of Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing.
" "Send me one quart of Aunt Martha's Old-Fash " They're all the same.
They're all orders.
Well, how..
wh-where did this mail come from?
How do these people know about this?
Um uh, well, yesterday we did a spot on Charlie Appleby's television show.
Well, there's two more sacks of mail downstairs.
Oh, no.
Well, what's the matter?
I thought you'd be glad.
Uh, we just applied a little arithmetic and we found out that they're losing money on every jar.
I thought it sounded too good.
Hey, Lucy, look at all this mail.
We must be terrific television salesmen.
Yeah.
Oh, listen!
Maybe we'd better go back on that program and unsell that salad dressing, and and then maybe all these people will take back their orders.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
Well, if we did such a good job of selling yesterday, maybe we can go back on again and unsell it today.
Here I am again, Mary Margaret McMertz.
And today I'm going to demonstrate the same product that I showed you yesterday.
And to get an unbiased opinion, I asked an average housewife, picked at random from our audience just before we went on the air, to come up here and help me.
Uh, would you come up here, average housewife whom I picked at random, please?
How do you do?
Hello.
I am Mary Margaret McMertz.
How do you do?
And what is your name?
What is your name?
Huh?
Your name, please?
Oh, Lucille Mcgillicuddy.
Oh, now, Mrs. Mcgillicuddy, you know why you're up here, don't you?
Huh?
You know why you're up here, don't you?
I'm No, I don't.
Well, I want you to try some of Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing and tell these people what you think of it.
Oh, all righty.
It's a mighty pretty color, isn't it?
Wow, wow!
What's that?
!
Why, that's Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing.
Are you sure?
Smell it.
How about that?
Looks like Aunt Martha had too many Old-Fashioneds.
What do you want me to do with it?
Why, I want you to taste it.
Taste it?
Now, maybe that's a bad jar.
You could say that again.
Here, let's try another one.
It's really delicious.
All righty.
What's Aunt Martha trying to do, poison me?
Friends, I can no longer endorse this product.
If you have ordered it, send in your cancellations.
Cancel, cancel.
Phone to: Circle 7-2099 or write to: 623 East 68th street.
And do it now.
Lucy!
Ethel!
The mail.
Here it is!
Come on in!
Here it is.
Open up.
Look!
Cancellations!
It worked.
Oh, boy.
Oh, yes.
Here.
"Keep kidding the product.
"It's wonderful.
Send me four jars.
" "Enjoyed your hilarious advertising stunt on television.
"Send me a jar of Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing.
" "That's the American way to do things- "with a sense of humor.
Send me a half a dozen jars.
" They're all orders.
Oh four quarts.
Send me one quart Lucy         Is that the last one?
Next to the last.
Stick out your tongue.
Thanks.
Mine went dry 200 jars ago.
Wow-wee.
Come on, I'm tired.
So am I. Whew!
Hi, girls.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I got to feeling sorry for you, so I got a whole assembly-line system figured out.
You can bottle this stuff in no time at all.
Well, thanks just the same, but we have news for you: We're all finished.
Come here.
Finished?
So soon?
My goodness!
How did you do it?
Oh, Lucy had a wonderful idea.
Oh, it wasn't so much.
We just went to the grocery store, bought 1,133 jars of salad dressing and pasted our labels on them.
And it only cost ten cents more a quart than ours.
What?
So we lost money.
We'll spend the rest of our lives making it up.
Yeah, the main thing is, we're done with it.
Yeah.
Are you?
What do you mean?
Well, you have to deliver this stuff.
It's gonna cost you at least 20 cents to mail it.
Just a minute, dear.
We have that all figured out.
Come, Ethel Roberta.
Oh, hiya, Fred.
Hi, Rick.
Did you tell them about our plan?
Yeah.
What's this?
!
They don't need our plan.
They went to the market store, they bought over a thousand and some more jars of this stuff, they got their own labels, they pasted it on, and they got it all finished.
Pretty clever.
I'm waiting here to find out how they're gonna deliver it.
Yeah, how are they gonna do that?
I don't know.
Look, I gave up trying to outguess them a long time ago.
Where's my assistant?
Well, you take the East Side, I'll take the West Side, and I'll be in Jersey afore ye.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Lucy, if you're gonna watch television, go in the living room.
If you're gonna eat your dinner, sit down and eat it.
If you'd gotten 		 home on time, we could have finished dinner before this program started.
Well, I'm sorry, but I have to earn a living.
Hi, folks!
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, kids.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be through dinner.
Oh, Ricky had			 to work late.
Want some coffee?
Just coffee?
Ethel, you can't be hungry again!
Oh, I just want a little sweet taste.
I have some			 some brownies, but I'm afraid they're pretty stale.
Stale brownies taste better.
Okay.
Just coffee will be fine.
All right, we'll have it	 in the living room.
All right.
Come on, Federico.
Can I help you?
Yeah, get me			 a couple more demitasse cups there,		 will you, dear?
How've you been, Fred?
Fine, thanks.
How are you?
Okay, boy.
Hey, who's going to win that fight Wednesday night?
I don't know,			 I haven't decided yet.
Say, how about, uh, me getting a couple of tickets	 and we go and see it, huh?
How can you go?
Don't you have to work?
Oh, didn't I tell you?
They're painting the club.
I got a week off.
Oh, great!
A whole week off?
Well, how come you didn't tell me before?
Well, I guess I figured 	 that Lucy would tell Ethel and Ethel would tell you.
Ethel didn't say a word.
I wonder why old blabbermouth kept it a secret.
Here's your coffee.
Oh, oh.
Good, good.
There we are.
There you are, Fred.
Ethel, why didn't you tell me Ricky had a week off?
What?
!
Lucy, why didn't you tell me Ricky had a week off?
Why didn't you tell me Ricky had a week off?
I tol' you.
No, you didn't "tol" me.
Well, I guess			 I thought I did.
Well, you didn't.
They're painting the club,	 so everybody gets a vacation.
They're painting the club,	 so everybody gets a vacation.
They're painting		 the club I heard, I heard!
Oh, honey, that's sensational.
When does it start?
It's already started.
They're beginning		 to paint tomorrow.
Oh.
Oh, boy, Ricky.
What are you going to do with all that time off?
Oh, don't worry about that.
I should say not.
Fred and I are going to see the fights Wednesday night, on Thursday night		 I got a poker game, and some of the boys		 are lining up a hunting trip			 for the rest of the week.
Well, haven't you forgotten something, dear?
No.
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I hate to tell you this, but the Lucy Ricardo Travel Bureau has made other reservations for you.
Such as what?
I can arrange for you to spend seven glorious days at 623 East 68th Street.
The cuisine is wonderful, the rates are reasonable, and we have facilities for all the popular sports such as vacuuming, washing dishes, hanging diapers out to dry.
Now, Lucy Besides, there's a gentleman who lives in this neighborhood who's just dying to meet you.
He's heard a lot about you and I think it's high time you two got together.
Who's that?
His name is Ricky Ricardo, Jr. You mean Little Ricky?
Oh, then you have heard of him!
Now, look, I don't want 	 to start any Uh, let's go, Fred.
Yeah.
We'll go through		 the kitchen, pick up those brownies		 on the way out.
Ethel!
Oh, I'm not gonna eat them.
I'm afraid they're gonna start throwing things.
If they use those brownies, they'll kill each other!
Now, just a minute.
Nobody has to go anyplace.
There's not going to be any arguments.
Lucy's absolutely right.
Oh, ye I am?
Yes, you are.
I'm going to cancel everything and stay right here at home with my child.
It's a boy, you know.
Oh!
I've heard.
Isn't that wonderful!
Sit down,			 you two.
Oh, honey, that's just great.
I'll go get Little Ricky.
He should be through		 with his book by now.
All right.
Book?
Yeah, he likes to spend about an hour with a good book before he goes to sleep.
Reading it?
No, tearing it.
He sometimes eats a page or two.
Oh, you're crazy.
I'll be right back.
Imagine that!
A whole week off		 with nothing to do but just hang around the house.
Yeah, I ought to take	 a week off myself sometime.
From what?
You've been hanging around the house for 23 years.
I wish you'd take a week off and go someplace!
Has it only been 23 years?
Time to go, beddy-bye.
That's a fella.
Aw Say good night to Aunt Ethel.
Good night, darling.
Say good night			 to Uncle Fred.
Night, son.
Say good night to Well, look who's here!
Mr. Ricardo.
How do you do, my boy!
You know I heard a lot about you.
We're going to be spending a lot of time together from now on.
Well, I'll tuck him in		 and tell him his bedtime story.
Hey, let me do that.
Do what?
Tuck him in and tell him his bedtime story.
Come on, my man.
Up you go.
Well, okay.
Give me his Okay.
bottle here.
What's your favorite bedtime story, huh?
"Little Red Riding Hood.
" "Little Red Riding Hood.
" "Little Red Ri " Oh, yeah!
You sure you know it?
Of course I know it.
My mother used to tell it to me when I was little child.
Oh.
We have bedtime stories in Cuba, too, you know.
You just rest your mind at ease.
Yes, sir.
Come on, boy, come on.
I'll tell you your favorite bedtime story, "Caperucita Roja.
" Oh, isn't it wonderful seeing them together?
Gee, you know, I "Capuracita Roja," what's that?
I don't know.
Maybe it's "Little Red Riding Hood" in Spanish.
Oh, this I got to see!
Can we come along?
Sure.
Come on, hurry up!
Oh, he's pushing the door	 for Papa and everything.
Boy, you're a big, strong boy.
Come on, now, come on.
Now, you be a good boy.
Shh I'm gonna bring your favorite toy.
Here we go.
Okay, look at this!
Whoo!
Come on!
Okay, I'm going to tell you your favorite bedtime story, "Caperucita Roja.
" Now, once upon a time, habia una muchachita muy bonita que le decian Caperucita Roja, porque siempre tenia un red bonnet.
Now, una manana,	 su mama le dio un basket, y en el basket puso frijoles, tortillas, y tambien le puso alli vino.
Y le dijo, "Caperucita Roja, lleva este basket "a tu granmama que esta en su casa y tu y tu granmama esta feeling lousy.
" Caperucita Roja cogio el basket y dice, "All right, Mama, adios, Mama," y se fue.
Y entonces miro, y alli estaba el lobo.
Y el lobo dijo, "Buenos dias, Caperucita Roja.
" Y caperucita dijo, "Buenos dias, SeÃ±or Lobo.
" Y el lobo dijo, "Â¿Que tiene alli en el basket"?
Y Caperucita dijo, "Aqui en el basket "Tengo frijoles, tortillas y vino "que se lo voy a llevar a granmama que esta feeling lousy.
" Y el lobo dijo, "muy bien.
Eh, Â¿porque no vas por el jardin and pick some flowers"?
Y Caperucita dijo, "All right, muy bien.
" Y se fue por el jardin to pick the flowers.
Y entonces el lobo dijo, "Aha!
Granmama en la casa"!
Boom, boom, boom!
Y granmama dice, "Halo, quien esta alli"?
Y el lobo dijo, "Caperucita Roja.
" Y granmama dice, "Venga!
Entra, entra"!
Y el lobo abrio la puerta y entro y estaba la granmama en la cama.
Mmm mmm-mm, mmm!
: Mmm Not bad!
Mmm Y entonces se metio en la cama y cogio el blanket y se cubrio.
Y Caperucita estaba por alla por el bosque pickando the flowers.
Y llego a la casa de granmama y abrio la puerta, "Buenos dias, Granmama.
" Y el lobo dijo, "Buenos dias, Caperucita.
" Y Caperucita dijo, "Granmama!
What big orejas tu tienes"!
Y el lobo dijo, "Si!
Para oirte mejor, my dear.
" Y Caperucita dijo, "Granmama!
What big ojos tu tienes"!
Y el lobo dijo, "Si!
Para verte mejor, my dear.
" Y Caperucita dijo, "Granmama"!
Que boca tan grande tu tienes"!
Y el lobo dijo, "To eat you with"!
Y entonces vino ya el hunter y el hunter hizo boom, boom, boom!
Y el lobo se cayo muerto.
Dead!
Y Caperucita, "Gracias, SeÃ±or Lobo.
"Gracias SeÃ±or SeÃ±or El Hunter.
Gracias por matar el lobo.
" Y el SeÃ±or Hunter dijo, "No hay de que, Caperucita Roja.
" Y entonces se sentaron para comer el dinner y se comieron las tortillas, los frijoles y el vino y todo el mundo vivio happily ever after!
Now, good night, old man.
Good night.
Wasn't that cute!
El lobo!
Shh!
Stop!
He was cute!
Fred sit down.
Sit down.
Well, how did it go dear?
Oh, fine,			 real good.
Isn't it fun telling him a bedtime story?
Oh, yeah.
Did you see		 the expression on his face			 when I did el lobo?
Yeah.
Wasn't that the cute What do you mean, did I see the ex Did you know we were out there?
Well, I didn't			 know it all the time.
At first I thought		 it was mice, but I never heard		 a mice giggle before.
I didn't know you were there	 till the very end.
It's wonderful taking care of the baby.
Why don't you let me take complete charge while I'm home?
You mean everything?
Yeah, all day, everything.
That means getting up at 6:00.
So?
That's not so tough.
Well, I don't know if you've noticed, working nights and all, but there's a 6:00 in the morning, too.
I know, I know.
Now, look, starting tomorrow morning, you don't have to worry about anything.
I'll get up and take care	 of the baby, and you can stay in bed 	 and sleep as long as you want.
Sleep as long as I want!
Oh, honey, that sounds so wonderful!
Isn't that great!
Ricky!
Ricky!
Ricky!
Ricky!
Ricky, the baby's gone!
Ricky!
Ricky  Okay, my boy, are you ready for your breakfast?
Yes, sir, nothing like a big breakfast!
Spanish omelet with green onions, green peppers and mushrooms.
Spanish omelet!
Come on, you got to eat all of your oatmeal.
All your oatmeal, come on.
Come on.
Then you grow big and strong and you can have a Spanish omelet, like your old man.
Come on, there you go.
There you are.
Listen, we'd better put a napkin on you because if you get some  with that oatmeal, Mommy will get mad.
Don't you want any more?
Okay, you had enough.
Come on.
We go get dressed	 for the day, eh?
We're gonna go out		 and play football and we're gonna box and we're gonna have		 a wonderful time.
Come on.
Up we go!
Up we go!
That's a boy!
That's a boy!
Yes, sir!
Shh!
We don't want to wake Mommy up.
This is the first good rest she's had in a long time.
Lucy, will you stop pacing back and forth!
I'm getting a crick in my neck.
Sorry, I guess I'm a little nervous.
After all, this is the first time Ricky's had to take care of the baby all day all by himself.
Now, listen, Lucy.
What's that?
What's what?
I heard a cry.
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, that was Mrs. Trumbull's cat.
Are you sure?
I am, unless Little Ricky's sitting on the windowsill going "meow.
" Come on, sit down, relax.
All right.
Oh, go get your hat and coat.
We're going shopping.
Oh, yeah, I guess it would be better if I got away from here.
Sure.
This is your big day off, remember?
Oh, yeah.
I'm just being silly.
I'll go get my things.
Look, Ricky.
Hey, Rick.
How about that?
Hi!
Hi!
Oh, hi.
How are you doing?
Fine.
Just fine.
Uh, Ethel and I thought we'd go shopping.
Fine.
Good, honey, go ahead.
Uh  He likes this horseback-riding business, you know?
Yeah, what a jockey he'd make.
Who do you like in the fifth at Santa Anita?
If you'd rather I didn't	 go shopping, I don't have to go.
Oh, now, honey, stop being a worrywart.
I'm not a worrywart!
Well, you run along, we'll be just fine.
Say good-bye, Mommy.
Okay, bye.
Good-bye, Mommy.
Bye-bye, darling.
Good-bye, Mommy.
Bye-bye, darling.
Say "Bye-bye, Mommy.
" Bye-bye, darling.
Bye-bye, Mommy.
Oh baby.
Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Mommy.
Hey, Rick.
Bye-bye.
Yeah?
What's the matter		 with this set?
Oh, I'll tune it, Fred.
Oh, I can fix it.
No, no, no, no, Fred.
Wait a minute.
I'll do it, I'll do it.
Let me do it, wait, hold it.
No, hold it.
Wait a minute.
This is		 a very funny thing here.
You got to know 		 how to do it.
Coming in now.
It is?
Yeah, that's the game.
There you are.
Well, get over there, sit down, let's watch it.
This is 			 the big game, yeah.
Oh, kickoff.
Wow, wow, wow, what's he doing?
!
Well, I'm ready.
I'm sorry I took so long.
I wasn't going to Lucy, you going to look like that all afternoon?
Probably.
Now, listen, honey, you got to get used to being separated from your son.
That's part of being a mother.
I don't see why.
Well it just is.
Uh, first, he'll go to school, and then he'll go away		 to college, and then he'll get married	 and leave home altogether.
: Oh no!
Oh, don't cry.
He'll come home	 for Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Oh.
That is, if his mother-in-law doesn't mind.
: Oh Come on, you'll feel better	 when we get in the stores.
Well, maybe you're right.
Oh!
Oh, Little Ricky!
What was he doing		 in the hall?
!
That's what I'd like to know!
Honey, are you all right?
Lucy!
Honey What?
Your door's open!
He must have crawled out	 and they didn't even miss him!
Oh, no!
Oh, no, honey, sneak sneak down and close that door.
Okay.
I've got an idea.
I closed the door.
Listen listen,		 you take care of the baby.
I'm gonna give a certain absent-minded Cuban a lesson he'll never forget.
Okay.
Come on here, darling.
Yes, it's all right, sweetie pie.
Come on, sweetie.
Here we are.
Turn that down a little bit, will you, Fred?
Yeah.
Hello.
Oh, hello, dear.
Oh, hi, honey.
Ethel and I were just getting ready to leave and I thought I'd check	 and see how Little Ricky was.
Oh, honey, stop worrying.
He's fine.
He's just fine.
Oh, is he?
Sure, sure.
Uh, well, uh, put him on, dear.
I'd like to say good-bye to him.
Wait a minute!
Fred, where's Little Ricky?
I don't know.
Look in the bedroom, will you?
Little Ricky?
Little Ricky!
Little Ricky?
He's not			 in there, Rick.
Uh uh Honey, Little busy's Ricky right now.
What's that?
Little Ricky's busy right now.
Busy, doing what?
He's watching the, the football game with-with his Uncle Fred.
Oh.
Yeah, I'll have him call you right after the game.
Gee, I didn't want to upset Lucy.
Fred, where is he?
!
Where is he?
!
I haven't got him!
He-he couldn't have left.
The door is closed.
He's got to be in the apartment someplace.
Maybe he's hiding.
Yeah, he's playing hide-and-seek, that's it!
Little Ricky!
Little Ricky!
Little Ricky?
Little Ricky!
Little Ricky?
Olly olly outsenfree!
Little Ricky?
Little Ricky!
Fred, he must have gotten out in the hallway someplace.
I'll go, I'll go get him.
I'll call the police.
Call the police, what for?
Well, every time a kid wanders away, you go down and look in the police station, and you find them there eating an ice-cream cone.
Okay, call the police.
Hello-o-o!
Hello.
I forgot my gloves.
Oh.
Where's Little Ricky?
Uh he-he's taking a nap.
Oh, another nap?
He already had one, dear.
I- I-I know, yeah, but his little eyes got very tired watching television, and he wants to take another nap.
Oh, well, maybe I'd better take a look at him, then.
No!
Lucy	 Why not?
Uh, uh, uh, well, uh You see, his team lost, and he's pretty upset.
That's right, yeah, his team lost, he's very upset.
Oh, well Yeah.
You-you run along, dear.
No, no, I-I think I'll wait and see him when he wakes up.
I miss him, darling.
Oh.
I'd better go look		 at the furnace.
Yeah, look at the furnace.
It's cold in here.
Go ahead, Fred.
Good-bye.
He, he, he might sleep for a long time.
He was very tired.
I'll wait.
Oh.
Anything wrong?
Wha-Whatcha?
Nothing's wrong, everything is fine.
I want to see my baby.
Now, Lucy, wait a minute.
I don't like the way you're acting.
I'll bet he isn't		 even in there.
Now, honey  Now, honey, don't be silly.
He couldn't possibly be Aha!
Aha.
He's here!
I mean, he's here.
Hel-Hel-Hello, son!
Hello, sweetheart.
: 	 How wonderful Uh, uh, come here, come to Mama, darling.
Hello, baby.
Hi, baby.
Hello.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hello, dear.
Hello, Honey.
Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Yeah?
He's gone!
Who's gone?
Uh uh uh, Fred.
I can't find him anywhere.
Here I am!
Fred's here.
Hello, son.
Did you have a nice nap?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Ah And I'll tell you something else.
It's impossible for me		 to lose weight on a diet.
I know what you mean.
Me, too.
I tried.
I diet for four or five days and I lose an ounce or two and then I see a piece of cake or pie and I'm dead.
That's the story of my life.
Me, too.
Ricky's been after me to lose a few pounds, but I just don't seem	 to have the courage to Wait a minute.
Look around you.
What's the matter?
It's happened again.
What has?
The great divide.
Same thing happens every time we have a party.
Look here.
You know, everybody around the 18th green was gathered around there.
You know, the whole membership of the Thunderbird Club was around the 18th green.
All I had to do was to make this missly two-foot putt	 to win, and I missed it.
Yeah.
It's the "missly" ones that get you.
I'd rather try a ten-footer	 than a two-footer any day in the week.
I don't blame you.
It's all right.
Don't blame you.
See what I mean?
Women in one room, men in the other.
Well?
What do you mean "well"?
Why does it have to be that way?
Why aren't we all in here, talking together?
Give me one good reason.
We're married.
Does that mean that we have to go to parties and separate like the sheep from the goats?
Well, we like talking about babies and clothes and recipes and they like to talk about sports and politics.
We're interested in different things.
Sure.
Just 'cause we're married to men doesn't mean we've got anything in common.
Don't you think this situation is disgraceful?
Oh, I don't know.
I've been going to parties	 ever since I was married.
It's always like this.
Sure.
I thought this is 	 the way it was supposed to be.
Well, I don't like it.
Are we going to continue to be sheep?
Well?
Baaah!
Well, I'm not.
I want my husband to pay attention to me.
So do I. Okay.
Come on.
Oh, frankly, I think it's gonna be a good thing	 for television.
Ricky.
Bill.
Fred.
Yeah?
Yes?
Come on in here with us.
Yeah.
Come on.
Okay.
Sure.
I'll be right in.
Sure.
How do you think color will take?
Color?
Well, there are two schools	 of thought on that matter.
Some people think, uh, well,	 it's just around the corner.
Others feel it's gonna		 be a year or two.
We didn't exactly stampede the goats, did we?
Maybe we'd better go down	 to Abercrombie and Fitch and see if they sell goat-mating calls.
You know, this is pretty insulting.
Yeah.
I think so, too.
I'm going to do something about this.
Yeah.
Come on.
Okay.
No, I-I read an article by Harry Ackerman.
He was talking about the color  All right, let's go.
Okay, Fred, break it up.
Come on.
What are you doing?
What's going on here?
All right, all right What are you doing?
All we're talking about 	 is a little business.
Come in here, sit down What's going on here?
There you are.
Ethel, what's eating you?
There.
This is more like it.
More like what?
More like the way it should be.
I don't get it.
Well, I'll explain it to you.
We don't want you in there.
We want you in here.
Why?
Because we're married.
What are you trying to do, rub it in?
Fred!
I know.
It's the same old complaint.
Lucy gets upset every time the men go into another room and talk to each other.
Yes.
All right, we won't go		 into another room and talk to each other anymore, dear.
Well, that's better.
We can talk			 to each other in here.
Now, that's not funny.
Husbands and wives should certainly find something to talk to each other about.
Why?
Come on now.
Shall we give it the old-school try?
Okay.
Uh, I saw Tom Williams today.
Tom Williams?
Mm-hmm.
Good old Tom.
How is he?
Fine.
That's good.
Mm, glad			 to hear it.
Yeah, it's nice to know that good old Tom is feeling well.
Yes, sir.
Uh, I asked him to come here tonight with his date.
Oh, who is he going with now?
Oh, some model.
He has a different date every week.
That's for sure.
You think he'll marry her?
: No.
The last time I saw Tom was	 at Madison Square Garden.
I think it was the night that Charles fought Layne- Walcott fought Layne, wasn't it?
Yeah, I remember that, only it wasn't with Charles and Layne, it was Charles and Walcott.
Oh, you're right.
That was			 a great fight.
That's the second Charles/Walcott fight Was a tremendous amount of action, that fight.
You remember what the action was?
It was the worst fight I've ever seen in my life.
What are you talking about?
He almost had him beaten in the third round.
Aw, come on.
Listen, I'll tell you one guy that could have beaten both Charles and Layne, and that's Louis.
No way.
If you want		 to go back, I'll tell you a guy who could have taken Louis- that's Dempsey.
If you really			 want to go back, I'll throw in you a guy	 that could've taken both Dempsey and Louis at the same time.
Who's that?
Bob Fitzsimmons.
Oh Are you kidding?
Oh, what do you mean,		 am I kidding?
Yeah.
That's the trouble with you young punks.
You've never seen		 a real fighter.
Aw, now Well, we'll see this one he's bringing tonight, and then we'll find out.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
You know Wait a minute.
Hold it.
What's the matter?
How does it feel to be a sheep again?
Look around you.
Didn't take long for our party	 to get back to normal, did it?
Oh, let's face it, Lucy.
We'll never gonna get them out of the kitchen.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Well  Oh, that must be Tom.
Oh, Tom, Hi, Lucy.
I'm so glad you could come.
How are you?
Nice to see you.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi, Lou Ann.
Sorry we're late, but Eve had to do a fashion show.
Oh, that's quite		 all right.
Oh, uh, Eve Whitney.
This is Lucy Ricardo.
How do you do?
Oh, how do you do, dear?
This is Mrs. Mertz.
Hello.
How do you do?
Mrs. Hall.
Hi.
How do you do?
This is Ethel,			 Lou Ann and Eve.
May I have your wrap?
Oh, my, that certainly		 is beautiful.
Thank you very much.
Um, where are the fellas?
Oh, they're out in the kitchen as usual.
You couldn't pry them out	 of there with a crowbar.
Come on in, Eve.
I'll introduce you.
That guy in his prime could've beat any one of those guys.
Hi, fellas.
Oh, hello, Tom.
Hello, Tom.
I'd like you to meet		 Eve Whitney.
This is Ricky Ricardo.
How do you do?
And Fred Mertz.
How do you do?
Bill hall.
How do you do?
Well, I won't bother you gentlemen.
I'll join the girls.
Oh, uh light?
Light?
Light?
Light?
Well, I'll say this for her,	 she got them out of the kitchen.
Yes.
Apparently, all the old goats needed was a young kid.
Hi.
Good morning.
What's good about it?
You're right.
Bad morning.
Honestly, every time		 I think about last night, I get mad all over again.
Me, too.
I haven't been such a wallflower since I was a foot taller than	 all the boys in dancing school.
Did you notice the way Ricky acted?
He wasn't any worse		 than the rest of them.
Oh, yes, he was.
He has a special line.
Did you ever notice, Ethel, that whenever he's around a good-looking girl, he becomes more Cuban?
The prettier the girl, the thicker the accent.
That's right.
By the end of the evening, I couldn't understand		 a word he was saying.
Sounded like he had a mouthful of frijoles.
Did you get a load		 of Fred Mertz?
I thought I'd die when he suggested playing post office.
Well, it was certainly a grim little evening.
Oh, well, there's no use brooding about it.
When you're married, that's the way things are.
What do you mean "that's the way things are"?
That's what we thought last night.
And then Eve Whitney walked in and, suddenly, that's the way things weren't.
So?
So, maybe it isn't our husbands' fault.
Maybe it's our fault.
Maybe we've been married so long, we've been letting ourselves go.
What do you mean by that?
What's Eve Whitney got that we haven't got?
Nothing.
We've got just as much as she's got, only lots more.
Yeah, but the lots more 	 is in all the wrong places.
Ethel, what would you say if I told you you could be just as attractive as Eve Whitney?
I'd say you've snapped your twig.
Listen, Eve Whitney didn't always look like that.
How do you know?
You never	 saw her before last night.
Because I heard her talking to Bill Hall when he cornered her and insisted on hearing the story of her life.
How about that?
Wasn't that nauseating?
Oh Well, she told Bill Hall that	 she went to a charm school.
It did wonders for her.
A charm school?
Yes, and this is the one she went to.
The very same one.
"Phoebe Emerson Charm School.
" "What is your C.Q."?
That means charm quotient.
"Come in and let us		 give you a free analysis.
" You and I are going		 down there, Ethel.
We are?
Oh, I don't think Well, honey, we can't go wrong	 with a free analysis.
That's right.
You think they can make a glamour girl out of me?
Sure.
Says right here,		 "We work miracles.
" Well, thanks.
Oh, I meant on both of us.
Come on, let's make		 an appointment.
No one here.
Gee, isn't this a beautiful place?
Lucy, I'm nervous.
Well, so am I, dear, but just try to act poised	 and sophisticated.
Okay.
Look at this.
Oh boy.
Ooh, look, aren't they beautiful?
Jiminy.
Oh, she's really Good afternoon.
Oh, hello.
Hello.
Aren't they lovely?
They're some of our graduates.
Oh, really?
They're very beautiful.
I'm delighted to see you.
I'm Miss Emerson.
Oh.
How do you do?
I'm Mrs uh Uh, this is Mrs. Mertz, 	 and I'm Mrs Mrs. Ricardo.
How do you do?
I suppose you're here for the Emerson checkup?
Well, is that			 the free analysis?
Yes, it's free.
Yes, that's the one.
We grade you in four points, and, uh, 100 Uh-huh.
is perfect.
And now if you'll step this way.
All right.
Lucy It's a lovely piece of furniture.
Yes, isn't it.
Now, the first point is the hair.
Will you please take off your hats?
Oh, dear, it must be awfully windy outside.
Here's a mirror.
Why don't you fix it the way it's supposed to be?
Is that the way it's supposed to be?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh.
Now for skin and makeup.
Hmm your skin's not bad.
Not bad at all.
Thank you.
You're very well-preserved.
And your makeup is adequate.
Do you always use that color powder?
Oh, I don't mean it the way it sounds, of course.
It's just that, here, we strive for a fresh, natural look, and that powder gives you	 a weird, very unnatural look.
You know what I mean, of course.
I'm not wearing powder.
Oh Well, now for our posture.
: Posture.
Just stand the way you normally stand.
Oh.
Now the next item is the voice.
Would you please speak, uh, Mrs. Mertz?
Uh   What shall I say?
Oh, anything at all.
Just give me your name and address.
I am Mrs. Ethel Mertz and, uh, I live at Uh, Mrs. Ricardo?
I am  I am Testing one, two, three, four, testing.
Well, now we'll total these up and see what our scores are.
Out of a possible you got 32, and you got 30.
You know, I feel sure our course could make hundred percenters out of both of you.
Yes.
Really?
It's unbelievable what we can accomplish.
Now, when would you like to start?
Oh, right away.
With scores like ours, there's not a moment to lose.
You said it.
Well, then, come with me.
All right, ladies, are you ready?
Yes, ma'am.
Ah.
Now, the first thing we're going to take up		 is the matter of relaxing.
Tension is our greatest enemy today.
A charming woman		 is a relaxed woman.
Now, a little beauty secret is to take a few minutes every day and just relax.
Relax completely.
Let yourself			 go absolutely limp.
Now, try it.
A little more.
Much more.
More, more, more, more No, Mrs. Ricardo,		 not that limp.
No.
Like this.
This is just			 a little trick for those days when you have to be		 on your feet all day.
Now you try.
That's right.
Now we'll work			 on our walk.
Let me see you walk.
Up.
Up, up, up, Mrs. Ricardo.
In an upright position.
Oh.
You go over there, Mrs. Mertz.
Okay.
And now, I'll show you how to walk.
You know, one doesn't lump along like a sack of meal.
Watch me.
One glides.
Let the hips carry the body.
The hips go first, and the body follows after.
Now you try, Mrs. Ricardo.
The hips go first, huh?
That's correct.
After you, hips.
Come in.
Hi, Rick.
Oh, hi, Fred.
What's new, old man?
I don't know, oh, but something is.
Ethel told me to stay out of the bedroom and wait for her over here.
Uh-oh.
They must be cooking something together.
Yeah.
Lucy won't let us		 in our bedroom either.
She says to wait out here	 for a pleasant surprise.
Uh-oh.
Now, what do you think		 this pleasant surprise could be?
Maybe they're leaving us.
No, no.
Well, Ethel's been acting strange all week.
So has Lucy.
How can you tell?
That's a very good question.
Yoo-hoo!
Ricky!
Yes!
Close your eyes.
All right.
You may open your eyes now.
May I have a light, please?
Thanks awfully, darling.
Who is that?
It looks like Lucy.
Lucy?
Yes, darling?
It is Lucy.
Well, what do you know?
Oh, that must be		 my dear friend Ethel.
Please, Fred.
I'll open the door.
Open it?
I was going to lock it.
Oh, my dear fellow,	 you have such a refreshing wit.
I hope		 I didn't hold up the party.
Not at all, darling.
Do come in.
Who's that?
What's that?
Oh, Ethel, darling,		 you do look stunning.
You look divine, darling.
Oh, Ethel, what is all this?
Lucy, 'splain.
"'Splain," darling?
Well, you ignored us, so we knew you weren't happy	 with us the way we were.
So, we took an extensive course at Miss Emerson's Charm School.
Oh, so that's it, huh?
Yes, that's it, darling.
Would you care to take two charming strangers		 out to dinner?
Out to dinner?
Uh, yes.
That's a great idea, Fred.
We can't waste all this charm here at home.
Oh, thank you, darling.
That's very,			 very sweet of you.
Uh, tell me dear, would you care to go to see Mrs. Trumbull	 and show her our gowns?
Well, just a minute.
We-we-we can't, we can't take out two such gorgeous ladies dressed like this.
Oh.
Oh, oh,			 of course, darling.
Uh, well, that's		 very sweet of you.
You go and change.
Come, dear, we'll show Mrs. Trumbull.
Yes.
Let's let her get a load of us.
Did you ever see anything like that?
I was waiting for Ethel to say "trick or treat.
" Then you open your big mouth and say something about taking them to dinner.
Wait a minute, Fred.
Don't get upset.
I've got a plan.
She really did seem		 to be impressed, didn't she?
Oh, they're not here.
Oh.
Well, we might as well sit down and wait.
Okay.
I can't sit down.
Neither can I. Well, we'll stand and wait.
Yeah.
Ricky, darling, do hurry, dear.
We're very hungry.
Just a minute!
Isn't that cute?
He wants to look so good.
Fred never took so long to dress.
He must be taking a bath.
Close your eyes!
Open your eyes.
Ricky Ricardo, what are you doing?
I'm taking you out to dinner.
Dressed like that?
Well, what's wrong with this?
This is the latest thing at the Little Gentlemen's Finishing School.
Oh, Ricky  That must be			 my good friend Frederick.
Enter.
Thank you, old chap.
Oh, good evening, ladies.
I trust I haven't kept you waiting, no?
Fred Mertz.
All right, fellas, this isn't funny.
We thought you'd like us looking like this.
We've been working like dogs going to charm school and exercising and wearing mud packs And plucking our eyebrows and wearing chin straps.
All right, all right, we know	 what you had to go through, but this is not for you.
This is not your style.
This is phony.
I thought you'd pay attention to me if I was well-groomed and charming and attractive.
I don't want you well-groomed, charming and attractive.
I want you the way you were.
What?
Oh, honey, I didn't mean it	 the way it sounded.
I mean, I like you		 the way you were.
Yeah, Ethel, I even like you the way you were.
Really?
Yes.
Now come on, girls.
Let's go back			 the way we were, huh?
You promise to stick close to us at parties?
Like glue.
Well okay.
Back the way we were?
All right.
Okay.
Back the way we were.
Four natural, lovable slobs.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Oh!
Ethel!
Ethel, I'm sorry.
What are you trying to do, kill somebody?
Oh, honey, I didn't know	 you were there.
Whew!
What are you doing with those things?
This is what I'm giving Ricky	 for our anniversary.
Oh.
Aren't they wonderful?
Oh, aren't they beautiful?
Gee.
What are the little booties on there for?
Booties?
Those are covers	 to protect the clubs.
Oh.
What do those numbers mean?
Oh, Ethel, don't you know anything?
Those numbers tell you how many strokes		 to take with that club.
Gee, that's a wonderful present.
Oh, I-I think he's going	 to be crazy about it.
Uh-huh.
I got to put it away, though.
Sure wouldn't			 want him to see it.
Uh-uh.
I don't think he'll see that.
No.
Oh, boy.
Now comes my yearly problem.
What's that?
Well, trying to figure out	 a way to give Ricky an inkling that 		 it's our anniversary without his knowing		 he's being inkled.
Oh, that shouldn't be difficult for an old, veteran inkler like you.
I know, but it's always 	 such a strain thinking up new ways		 to remind him.
You don't suppose,		 just this once, he might remember		 all by himself, do you?
What was that for?
Uh, wh-what was what for?
That expression on your face.
Uh, uh uh, I have a little indigestion.
It was a smile.
Oh, I always smile when I have a little indigestion.
Now, Ethel, cut that out.
You know something.
No, I don't.
I don't know anything.
I'm a dunce.
You're keeping something from me.
Uh, uh, well, uh, see you later, Lucy.
Ethel Mertz, you're		 not going anywhere until you tell me		 what you know.
Ricky remembered		 my anniversary, didn't he?
I guess it wouldn't hurt to tell you that much.
Yes, he did.
Oh, good.
Well, so long.
Ethel!
You know 		 more than that.
Come on now.
What did he tell you?
He must have talked to you.
He must have asked your advice about my present.
What did he want to know?
What size I wear?
What color I look best in?
How big a diamond		 I like in a ring?
I'm not going to say another word.
Ethel, I'm going to ask you	 just one more question and then you can go.
Do you know what Ricky is giving me for our anniversary?
Yes, I do.
What is it?
What is it?
I thought you were only gonna	 ask me one more question.
I am.
What is it?
Oh, I've already told you more than I should.
I told you he remembered your anniversary, and I told you I knew what he was getting you.
You'd think you'd be satisfied.
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
Yes, I would.
Has he already bought it?
Am I gonna like it?
He bought it weeks ago, you're gonna be thrilled to pieces, and let go of my arm before it's eight feet long.
Well!
Now, can I step down off the witness stand?
Okay.
See you later.
Hey, wait a minute.
Come here.
If he bought it weeks ago, it must be hidden here in the house.
Where is it?
Where is it?
I'm not gonna tell you.
Ethel, please, just-just tell me if I if I'm getting close to it.
Just tell me if I'm warm.
No, I won't.
Ethel, you tell me,	 or I'm going to tell Fred that you've been saving out of the food money to buy yourself that monkey fur jacket.
I'll tell him you've been sewing roast beef bones on a chuck roast.
You wouldn't dare.
Oh, wouldn't I?
Hmph!
I'm going.
I'm going to tell him.
I'll count to three.
One two two-and-a-quarter two-and-a-half Oh, Ethel, I just got	 to know about my present!
Now come on, please!
Just tell me if I'm hot or cold, huh?
Just tell me, please.
Please?
Please, Ethel?
Okay.
Cold.
Cold.
Cold.
Cold.
Cold.
Oh, freezing!
Freezing.
Uh, warmer.
Uh, wa Oh, warmer.
Warmer.
Wa Oh, wha Oh, you're boiling hot!
If it was a snake, it'd bite your knee!
Ow!
Oh!
Oh, thank goodness, it's gift-wrapped so you can't untie it.
Oh, can't I?
I can get	 the meat out of a sausage without touching the skin.
Oh, I shouldn't have done it.
I shouldn't have told you.
I tried not to tell you, didn't I?
Oh!
Ethel!
I've already seen them.
Aren't they beautiful?
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, Ethel!
They're stone martens.
Stone martens!
Uh-huh.
Oh!
Ethel Mertz, you make me so mad.
What did I do?
You told me about my present and now I won't be surprised.
Look at that snowman.
Aw, look at the picture of Mommy and Daddy		 on their honeymoon.
Look at that, honey.
See the snow?
Look at the snow.
See Mommy?
Look at that.
Hi.
Oh, hi, darling.
Say, what are you doing up so late, old man?
Oh, he was such a good boy,	 I let him stay up to say good night to Daddy.
Oh, good.
Hello, sweetheart.
How are you?
Hello.
Come on.
Beddy-bye.
Okay.
You were a good boy, eh?
Oh, he was wonderful.
Well, there you are.
He even ate all 		 of his spinach today.
Well, listen, you're gonna	 grow up to be a big, strong boy.
You'll probably be a football player.
He's awful tired now, though.
Come on, honey.
Come on, sweetheart.
I let him stay up too late.
Ah  Well, it's all right, sweetheart.
Now say your prayers.
Gee, honey, don't those pictures bring back a lot of memories?
You know, it's wonderful	 how many great times we've had.
Yes, sir.
Say, we have an anniversary coming up one of these days, haven't we?
Yeah.
Well, I'll pick up a box of candy or something.
Oh!
Oh-ho-ho!
Hey-hey, look at that.
That's the night before we got married.
Gee, that's a cute couple.
I wonder what ever happened to them.
Haven't you heard?
They lived happily ever after.
We have had fun, haven't we, honey?
Yes, sir.
These have been the best What's the matter?
We've only been married 13 years.
Oh.
Well, I-I mean, it seems like 15.
What?
No, uh, what I meant is, it doesn't seem possible that all that fun could have been crammed into only 13 years.
Well, you wormed		 out of that one.
Besides, it isn't even		 13 years until tomorrow.
All right.
What do you want to do on our anniversary?
Do?
You have to work.
No, I don't.
I'm gonna take the night off.
I've already arranged it.
I don't believe it!
It's true.
Now, what do you want to do?
I'll take you anyplace you want to go.
Well you know		 what I want to do?
What?
You won't laugh at me?
No.
I want to have a quiet little dinner at home, just the two of us, you know, candles		 and champagne and our favorite records	 on the phonograph.
Oh, honey, that sounds wonderful.
Doesn't it?
A cozy, romantic dinner for two just like it was		 on our honeymoon.
It'll, it'll just be		 our night, huh?
Okay, sweetheart.
If that's what you want to do, that's just what we'll do.
Fred, guess what.
What?
The maitre d' from the Tropicana just called me.
Our surprise party tomorrow night is off.
Well, it's their anniversary, isn't it?
Yes, it's their anniversary, but Ricky's decided to take the night off.
How do you like that?
He's worked every Tuesday night since we've known him.
Well, in that case, we'll just	 have to phone all the people and tell them we're gonna	 have the party here.
If the Ricardos are going to be here, we'll have to find that out.
Let's go over there and see, huh?
All right.
Come on.
Hey Yeah?
This is the night that we went to the Copa.
Oh, yes.
Didn't we have fun that night?
Oh, I had forgotten that dress.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Wait a minute.
Who's that?
Where?
Oh, that's		 Fred and Ethel.
Fred and Ethel?
Yeah.
Haven't you seen that?
Ethel gave it to me.
That's when			 they were first married.
Hi.
What's so funny?
How about that?
Fred with hair.
Yeah, I remember		 when this was taken.
But who's the slim, young girl with me?
Oh, now, Fred, I haven't changed that much.
Now, Ethel, as my hair thinned, your hips spread.
Oh, poo.
Come on, we've all changed quite a bit since then.
I guess so.
Yeah, let's talk about something a little pleasanter.
Sit down, come on.
Sit down.
All right.
Uh, Ricky, uh, what are you going to do tomorrow night on your anniversary?
Oh, uh, I'm going to		 take the night off.
You are?
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, uh, what are you going to do?
Well, uh, Lucy wants to Uh, we have to		 we have to go out to dinner.
Uh, a business dinner.
A business dinner?
Uh-huh, yes.
They called	 just before you came in.
Uh, Ricky wanted		 to turn them down, but I wouldn't let him.
It's too important.
Well, who's it with?
Rodgers and Hammerstein.
Rodgers and Hammerstein?
Rodgers and Hammerstein?
Rodgers 			 and Hammerstein?
Uh, see?
He's still surprised.
He can't even believe it,	 can you, dear?
No no.
It's, it's very hard to believe.
Well, um uh, I guess we got to go.
We got something to do.
Yeah, we got to go.
Come on, Fred.
Why do you have 		 to go so soon?
Yes, we have something to do.
but we'll see, we'll see you again.
Don't have to run.
See you guys later.
What's all this about a business dinner?
Well, I'm sorry, but I-I just didn't want them to know that we were gonna be home.
I wanted to be alone with you.
Okay, honey, but why Rodgers and Hammerstein?
Well, nothing but the best	 for my husband.
If you're gonna have dinner	 with somebody, might as well have it		 with Rodgers and Hammerstein.
Now this is a mess.
We've got a whole surprise party full of people and nobody to surprise.
Oh, there must be some way	 to figure this out.
I don't think it'll work.
Of course it will.
Why not?
Look.
Well, the Mertzes always know when we're home.
So, we'll go out.
Well, that doesn't make sense, even for you.
Look, we'll go out		 and make a lot of noise so that they'll know we're leaving, then we'll sneak quietly in through the kitchen door and have our own little celebration.
Well Please.
Fred, I've got it.
I'll see you later.
Well, where you going?
I'm gonna see Mrs. Trumbull.
If they're going out, they'll have to get Mrs. Trumbull to stay with the baby.
And if Mrs. Trumbull tells them that she can't baby-sit after 9:00, they'll have to come home, and we can have our party.
Ethel, you're slicker		 than slippery elm.
Well, honey, I don't know.
Oh, please, Ricky?
Please?
Just for me.
It means so much to me.
Okay, we'll do it.
Okay, honey, thank you!
Ricky?
Yeah, honey.
Mrs. Trumbull said		 she could baby-sit until 9:00, so I told her			 we'd be back then.
Oh, gee, doesn't this look nice?
This is gonna be the nicest anniversary we've ever had.
Say, uh, what are we having for dinner?
The same thing we had		 on our first anniversary.
Raw potatoes and burned roast?
Oh Aw, come now.
I've learned to cook a little better since then.
Yes, you have, sweetheart.
What about opening our presents, huh?
Oh, not now, honey.
We have to make like we're leaving first, remember?
Okay.
Come on.
Ready?
Yeah.
Stay right there.
All right.
Uh, hurry up, dear!
We mustn't be late!
We mustn't keep Dick and Oscar waiting!
All right,			 I'll be right there!
Okay.
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Hi.
It's Ethel.
She's coming in here.
Get-get-get my, uh, stole- it's in there on the chair- and my bag.
And get your coat.
Hey, Lucy, open up!
Okay.
Uh Uh, well, I-I-I'd		 ask you in, Ethel, but, uh, we're			 kind of in a rush.
Well, I just want to see how you look in your new dress.
Oh, well, I'll come out there.
The light's better in the hall.
Oh, Lucy!
Oh, that's just beautiful.
Thank you.
Oh, my.
Gee, it's nice you're having dinner with Rodgers and Hammerstein, but it's too bad it had to happen on your anniversary.
Yeah, well, business		 is business, you know.
Yeah.
Uh Thank you, dear.
It's all right.
Oh, boy.
Thanks very much.
Well, we'll see you later.
Okay.
Have a good time.
You're a handsome couple.
Thank you.
Thank you, honey.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye Bye.
Oh, Fred what are you doing here?
They could have seen you.
Oh, they've gone, haven't they?
This ought to be a good time	 to get things set for the party.
No, we got to wait till they get in the taxi and drive away.
They might have forgotten something and come back.
Oh.
Oh, everything's just working out perfectly.
They're gonna be		 the most surprised people.
In the whole world.
Shh!
I feel like a burglar.
We made it.
Give me your coat.
We're all alone.
Happy anniversary, darling.
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Now for the presents.
Okay.
You sit right down there.
Okay.
Gee, I can hardly wait		 to see what it is.
Oh!
Don't tell me it was hidden there all this time.
Oh!
Yeah.
For heaven's sake.
Happy anniversary, honey.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Gee, I can't imagine what it is.
Is it a nightgown?
Um a sweater?
Um some candy?
Oh!
Oh, Ricky!
Oh, furs!
Oh, honey!
Oh!
They're just		 out of this world.
You like them?
Oh, honey, they're wonderful.
Oh, gee.
I hope they're the right color and everything.
Oh, honey, the color		 is perfect.
You should see how they look	 with my new gray dress.
I mean uh they ought to look good with my new gray dress.
I mean, I ought to see how they look			 with my new gray dress.
I ought to keep 		 my big mouth shut.
Lucy, you peeked.
Well yes, kind of but I love them.
I've loved them 		 for a whole day.
But I wanted you to be surprised.
Oh, I was,			 when I found them.
Okay.
Now for your present.
All right.
Close your eyes.
Why?
Well, it was			 too big to wrap.
Oh, all right.
Okay?
Open your eyes.
Golf clubs!
Yeah.
Oh, honey, just what I wanted.
Really?
Oh, they're beautiful!
They're all matched, whatever that means.
And there are four woods	 and there are eight irons and there's			 the most wonderful What happened?
Where is that?
Let's see.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
That's funny.
One of them's missing.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm positive.
Th-The putter is gone.
You sure?
Yeah.
Maybe it dropped		 out of the bag in here.
Now, where could that be?
Hey, honey?
Honey!
Le-Let's open the champagne, honey.
You'll find it later.
Don't worry, come on.
Well, I can't understand that.
They're beautiful.
Don't worry, honey.
How could it drop		 out of the bag?
Four woods and one,		 two, three, four, five, six Now, where in the world did?
Ricky!
Oh, you found the putter.
I told you you'd find it, sure.
Ricky, where did this		 come from?
The putter?
Yes, the putter.
Where did the putter come from?
Yeah, where did the putter	 come from?
Well, um if you must know, I found the golf clubs in the closet while you were at Ethel's and	 I was practicing with the putter and you came back and I had to hide it under the couch.
Oh, Ricky, you're as bad as I am.
Worse.
Happy anniversary, fellow peeker.
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Oh.
Oh, it's locked.
Go get the key, Fred.
The Mertzes?
!
They're trying			 to get in here.
What do we do?
Hide.
Where?
In the closet.
All right.
I'll take this.
Here, take these things, too.
Okay, I'll take the candles.
Ah, ha, ha!
There we are.
Ah, where do I put this box?
Uh, just put it down there	 on the divan.
All right.
Ooh, they must have		 been playing Scrabble.
Yeah.
That saves us putting up the table.
Well, for once, we kept a secret.
They're really gonna be surprised.
Hey, look at these.
Yeah, Lucy got those for Ricky.
Ain't they beauties?
Uh-huh.
Uh I suppose you know what those numbers mean.
What?
They tell you how many strokes to take with that club.
What idiot told you that?
Lucy.
Well, that figures.
Now, come on,		 you didn't see the present we're giving them, did you?
No.
I'd like to see it.
Okay, I wanted to show it to you before I wrapped it up.
I'm crazy about it.
Oh, that's			 a good-looking lighter!
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Well, you could've at least taken the price tag off $32.50!
Have you lost your mind?
That's not the real price.
I erased the real price and wrote that on myself.
Oh.
Well what is the real price?
$4.95.
Come on now, let's not be too cheap.
Cheap?
We're giving them champagne and cake and a party.
Yeah, that's right.
Besides, look who's talking about being cheap.
Ricky bought Lucy furs for their anniversary.
I've always wanted a fur coat.
Now, listen, honeybunch.
If nature had intended		 for you to have a fur coat, you'd have been born with one.
Oh, honestly.
Well, I'd better tidy up the room, huh?
Yeah.
But Now, don't open that bottle of champagne!
It'll just sit around and get flat.
Don't worry.
I won't let it	 just sit around and get flat.
Now, Fred,			 give me that champagne.
Come on now.
Help me set the table, will you?
All right.
Pick the cake up.
Put that there.
Got it?
Yeah.
Heavy, isn't it?
Yeah, but it looks good.
Mm-hmm.
Isn't that a beautiful cloth?
Uh-huh.
Now, put the cake back down.
All right.
Now, paper napkins.
They're in that box.
Get them for me, will you?
Yeah.
And bring their glasses.
They're prettier than ours.
All right.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Fred?
Yeah?
How did you get out here	 in the kitchen so fast?
Well, I walked out here.
What's the matter with you?
Well, you just handed me these napkins and the minute I got my hand on them, you said, "You're welcome.
" I didn't just hand you		 the napkins.
What do you mean you didn't just hand them to me?
Well, I mean that I just didn't hand you the napkins.
Now, listen, I ought to know whether you handed me these napkins or not.
Are you insinuating that I'm daft, loony, off my rocker, out of my head?
Well, that covers it pretty well, yeah.
One of us is loony.
Oh, well.
Let's straighten these out.
Okay.
Oh, that looks all right.
Yeah.
Now, you go out in the kitchen and get the cake plates, and I'll go in the bedroom to see if it's all right so the guests can leave their hats and coats.
Cake plates.
Cake plates.
Hi.
Come on in.
They're not here yet.
They'll be here pretty soon.
Well, they said they'd		 be here at 9:00, you know.
I- I was sure they'd have	 to be back by then.
It's 10:00 now.
Well, we just have to wait a while longer.
Just be patient.
What was that?
!
It was out in the kitchen.
It's a champagne bottle!
What?
!
It exploded.
Lucy?
Yeah?
Have you got your key?
I forgot mine.
Yeah, I have it here.
Get it for me, will you?
Okay.
Come on, honey, where is it?
Here you are.
Oh, okay.
Come on.
Surprise!
Oh!
Oh, my Oh, my.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Come on, Ricky, time to get up.
I'm out of half-and-half.
Thanks.
What'll you have- bacon or eggs?
I'll have some What do you mean, "bacon or eggs"?
Why can't I have both?
Because.
"Because"?
Lucy, you mean to tell me that you're over your food budget again?
Yes, I am,			 but it's your fault.
My fault?
Yes.
If you'd			 give me more money, this wouldn't happen.
"More money"?
Yeah.
You're such a peso pincher.
Â¿Mira que tiene cosa de decir que yo soy un peso pincher?
Se gasta mas mas dinero en la casa que ninguna mujer que yo conozco And don't jabber at me		 in a foreign tongue.
That is not a foreign tongue, that's Spanish.
Hi.
Hi, Fred.
Ethel tells me			 your faucet's leaking.
Well, you didn't have to rush over.
I told her two years ago.
I had to make a stop on the way.
Oh, Fred,		 do you have to fix it now?
Can't you wait till after breakfast?
Do you want it fixed		 or not?
All right.
What's the matter with everybody?
Everybody's so grumpy every morning around here.
Grumpy?
!
Who's grumpy?
!
Never mind.
You didn't tell me what you wanted- bacon or eggs?
What are you going to have?
Bacon.
I'll have an egg.
Okay.
I'll swap you half of my egg for half of your bacon.
Well, that's a sneaky way to get bacon and eggs.
Hello?
Hello?
Who?
Hello, Jerry.
What?
Hold it a minute, will you?
I'm trying to talk on the phone.
Will you hold it a minute?
I'm trying Hold it, please.
Hold it.
: Hold it!
Well!
And he says we're grumpy.
Yeah.
Yes, Jerry, what would you like?
I got you all set for an interview with Eleanor Harris, the big magazine writer.
Oh?
Yeah.
She wants to do an article on a really happily married couple, you know, like you and Lucy.
Oh.
Yeah, she wants to spend an entire day with you- you know, take pictures and everything- right from the time	 you get up in the morning.
Good idea.
When does she want to start?
Well, how about this morning?
You'd better wait		 till tomorrow morning.
We'll be more happily married then.
Okay.
Well, see you tomorrow, Okay.
Oh, and Rick, she wants to catch you just the way you really are.
So, don't make any preparations for this.
Okay, we'll be just the way we are all the time.
Good-bye.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hey, hey, hey!
A magazine writer is coming over tomorrow morning to do an article on you and me.
Oh?
Yeah.
She's, she's gonna do an article on a couple		 of happily married people.
What time is she coming?
In the morning?
!
Yeah!
Ew The idea is that she wants	 to come early in the morning, see, and take some pictures	 and see us exactly as we are.
Good morning.
Hi, Lucy.
This is Eleanor Harris.
Lucy Ricardo.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Nice to know you.
Won't you come in?
Well, thank you.
This is an awful thing to do to anybody, barging in at this hour of the morning.
I hope you don't mind too much.
Not at all.
We love company, especially in the morning.
Won't you sit down?
Thanks.
Well, I can see that you two kids are going to get along together just fine.
Oh, certainly, Jerry.
Well, I'll be running along.
All right.
I think I'll go home and go back to bed.
Good-bye, Jerry.
Well, uh, what should we do first?
Oh, don't pay any attention to me.
You just go ahead and do whatever you'd be doing if I weren't here.
Oh.
Oh, well, then I'll 	 go ahead and get breakfast.
Fine.
What would you like?
Oh, thanks.
I've already had mine.
Oh, all right.
Pardon me.
Uh, Mrs. Ricardo, do you always dress like that when you're getting breakfast?
Oh, certainly.
I- I don't like to wear my good things just puttering around the house.
Uh, hold it.
Good morning, darling!
Oh, sweetheart, good morning.
Angel You handsome Hold it!
Oh, I didn't know		 we had company.
Yes.
Yes, this is Miss Harris who came to do the magazine interview, remember?
Oh, yes.
How do you do?
How do you do, Mr. Ricardo?
I hope you don't mind our starting the interview	 so early.
Oh, no, not at all.
We don't mind, do we, dear?
Not at all, dear.
Won't you sit down, dear?
Thank you.
Did you have a nice sleep, darling?
Oh yes, I slept like a top.
I awoke refreshed and with a song on my lips.
Here's to you, sweetheart.
Oh, no.
Here's to you, darling.
Oh, say, that's cute.
Hold it.
That's fun.
Thanks.
Um, what are we having for breakfast this morning?
Oh, the usual things: waffles with sausages, omelets with ham, eggs Benedict- take your choice.
Well, it's so hard to decide.
You know, Lucy spoils me terribly.
Oh You know, I-I She's such a good manager with the small amount	 of money that I give her.
I- I don't see how she does it at all.
Oh, darling, now, anyone could run a household on the generous allowance that you give me every month.
Thank you, dear.
Well, I'll just have something simple this morning- something like, uh bacon and eggs.
Okay.
Well, okay.
Hold it!
Good morning!
: 		 I brought back the half-and-half I borrowed.
Oh, I didn't know you had company!
Yes, yes, Ethel.
Uh, Miss Harris, this is Mrs. Mertz.
How you do?
How you do?
I'm the landlady and Lucy's best friend Ethel Mertz.
M- e-r-t-z.
Well, Ethel, thanks a lot for bringing back : the half-and-half, but see you later, huh?
Huh, honey?
Hi, folks.
How's the little old leaky faucet?
Well, if it isn't the Beau Brummell of the plumbers.
Well, Lucy, I didn't know you had company.
Uh, yes, Miss Harris, this is Mr. Mertz, M- e-r-t-z.
How do you do?
I suppose you two have had breakfast.
No, we haven't.
No, we haven't.
Uh, you don't want to eat with us, do you?
Oh, yes, we'd love to.
Oh, that's marvelous.
I can get a picture of you	 with your neighbors.
A picture!
Oh, gosh, if I had known I was gonna have my picture taken, I'd have dressed up a little.
How do you want us to?
Oh, just something informal.
All right.
What?
I can't hear you.
All right, that's Wait a minute.
Hold it, fellas, will you?
Just hold it for a minute.
What was that?
Yeah.
Well, look, as long as the costumes get here in time for the show, that's all I'm interested in.
Okay, well, thank you very much.
Good-bye.
Hi, Ricky.
Oh, hi, Jerry.
Hey, where's Eleanor,		 the magazine gal?
She's still with Lucy.
She'll be here tonight.
Oh.
What are you so tired about?
What am I so tired about?
You see these grubby little hands?
Yes Well, these little pinkies of mine have become ink-stained 	 and all cramped just so that you could become	 a star of the first magnitude.
What?
Here.
Cast your great, big, shoe-button eyes on that.
"Dearest Minnie, how about a date Saturday night?
"Will you meet me at the Tropicana Club?
Ricky Ricardo.
" Now, what would you think	 if you got a postcard like that?
I would think I'd better go and see my physio-chiatrist.
No, no, I mean, 		 if you were a woman.
I think you'd better go and see your physio-chiatrist.
Come on, what is this?
"To Minnie Finch,		 1433 Tudor Street, Bronx.
" Looks like my signature, too!
I copied it.
Pretty good, huh?
Too good, boy.
Watch it.
Come on, what is it?
Don't you get it, Dad?
It's brilliant.
I sent one of these cards to every woman on the Tropicana mailing list- Yeah.
Boy, Saturday night this joint is gonna be overflowing with women.
Pretty good, huh?
Well, it'd better be.
No, no, you keep that one	 as a souvenir.
I made it out twice by mistake.
Hey, come on.
I'll buy you	 a cup of coffee.
All right.
Take ten, fellas.
You know, Jerry, there are times when I think you're crazy, and there are other times when I'm sure of it.
Really?
Well, that was			 our first meeting, and then a couple months later, we said "I do," and we've been happily married ever since.
Mm-hmm.
All right, now I'd like to get a few quotes from you.
All right.
Tell me, what's it like being married to an entertainer?
Oh, it's very exciting.
After all, there's no business	 like show business.
You may quote me.
Fine.
I, um, I suppose you and Ricky had your share of arguments?
Ricky and me?
Oh, heavens, no.
Oh, come on, Lucy.
Surely you have a little tiff now and then?
Tiff?
Now, you may not believe this, Eleanor, but Ricky and I have never tuffed.
Taffed?
Tiffled?
Oh, it's marvelous.
You're not the jealous type, then, hmm?
Well, what is there		 to be jealous about?
Well, after all, Ricky is a handsome, charming man surrounded by showgirls all the time.
Well And he is out every night in a nightclub.
But that's his job.
The last person that told me that was the wife of a famous piano player.
He told her that he was at rehearsal every afternoon.
And he wasn't?
He was playing all right, but not the piano.
My goodness, she'd been married to a man like Ricky, she wouldn't			 have had to worry.
When he says he's at rehearsal, he's at rehearsal.
May I quote you on that?
Oh, sure, sure.
Well, I guess that's the kind of trust that's made your marriage last.
Isn't it?
Hmm?
I said, that's the kind of trust that's made your marriage last.
Yeah, that's			 the kind of trust that you have to have in-in that kind of in any kind of a marriage.
All right.
Now, how long have you two been married?
Hmm?
I said, how long have you two been married?
Would you excuse me?
I want to look at the baby.
Well, yes, certainly.
Hello.
Tropicana?
I'd like to speak to Mr. Ricardo, please.
Hello, Rick?
Oh.
Oh, he isn't there right now?
Do you have any idea where he might be?
You don't.
Well, uh No, no message.
Thank you.
Mmm!
That was a delicious dinner, Lucy.
Thank you.
Just something	 I threw together.
Really?
Those crÃªpes suzette are the best I've tasted in years.
Well, thank you.
Yes, they had just the right amount of cognac.
They were even better than last night's.
Well, thank you, darling.
I think we'd better go, Eleanor.
It's getting kind of late.
Oh, all right.
I'll go put my face on.
Will you excuse me?
Certainly.
Certainly.
Are you out of your mind?
Shrimp cocktail, steak?
This dinner must have cost a fortune.
Never mind that.
I want to talk to you.
Where were you this afternoon?
At rehearsal.
All afternoon?
Yeah.
What's the matter with you?
I called you this afternoon about 2:00, and you weren't there.
I wasn't?
No.
Well, I stepped out for a cup of coffee or something.
Ha!
What are you driving at?
Nothing, and we can't discuss it now while she's here, trying to get a story about how happily married we are.
Give me a cigarette.
Okay.
Oh, never mind, 		 I'll get it myself.
I'll get I was looking for my cigarette case.
I misplaced it.
I'm all set.
All right.
Here you are, sweetheart.
Thank you, darling.
I was looking for my cigarette case.
I misplaced it, so I bet it's in that sport coat I wore this afternoon.
Oh, well, I'll get it, dear.
Oh, thank you, darling.
I'll get my overcoat.
I'll be right with you.
Okay.
Oh!
Is this it?
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
We-we got it, honey.
See you later.
Bye, Lucy.
Thanks for a nice day.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Hi.
I just saw Miss Harris leave and I thought I came up to see how everything went.
How were my crÃªpes suzette?
Aw, were they soggy?
No.
Were they heavy?
No.
Well, did they flame?
Yeah, they flamed.
Well, what's the matter?
I just found out that Ricky	 is seeing another wo-wo-wo Ricky's what?
Ricky is seeing another wo-o- wo-o-o What does Ricky want to see another wo-wo for?
Ricky is seeing another woman!
Oh, Lucy, what are you talking about?
That!
I don't get it.
Who's Minnie Finch?
I don't know.
All I know is, I called him at the club at 2:00, and he wasn't there.
So he wasn't there.
Now, don't you give me that.
You can see it as plain as I can.
Ricky is a very handsome and charming man and he's out late every night and he's surrounded by beautiful showgirls and-and then now that.
And I'll bet she's the most beautiful showgirl of all.
And I'm going down to see her	 and have it out!
Oh, now, Lucy, you're being ridiculous.
Oh, am I?
If some woman was trying	 to take Fred away from you, you'd sing another tune.
Yeah, "Happy Days Are Here Again.
" How can you make jokes		 at a time like this?
Now come on, get your coat.
I'll go see if Mrs. Trumbull	 can take care of Ricky.
Well, how can you tell who lives where?
There are no numbers on the doors.
Lucy, does this look like	 the kind of place one of Ricky's girlfriends would live?
Well, that just shows you how shrewd she is.
She doesn't think anybody'd look here.
Okay.
Let's knock on the door	 and ask where she lives.
All right.
Suppose she lives here, what do I say?
Why, just say, "Good evening, madam," punch her in the nose and get it over with.
I know, I'll pretend that I'm conducting a poll and I'll I'll sort of introduce Ricky's name subtly, you know, and see how she reacts, huh?
That's a good idea.
Oh, pardon me, but could you tell me where Minnie Finch lives?
Well, that's her place right there.
You're standing right in front of it.
Thank you.
Do you want to see Minnie or don't you?
Yes, I do.
Well, then, knock!
:		Hey, Minnie, you got company!
You got to give her a chance to hear you.
You girls looking for me?
Uh, no.
I-I don't think so.
Is Minnie Finch at home?
Oh, that's me.
Oh.
Well, what can I do for you?
Well, um, we're, uh we're, we're conducting a poll, and we'd like to ask you	 some questions.
Uh hmm Say, your name ain't Kinsey, is it?
No.
No, we're We're conducting a poll to find out who is the most popular orchestra leader in the country.
Oh, yes, yes.
Do you, uh, happen to know Ricky Ricardo?
Do I kn do I know him?
I'll say I do.
Say, he's mad about me.
Mad about you?
And how.
I got a date with him Saturday night.
Oh.
Do you see him often?
You want to laugh?
Five years ago, I went	 to the Tropicana on my birthday.
Well, they brung a big cake over to the table, and Ricky Ricardo come over and kissed me.
And today, five years later, I get a card asking me for a date.
Oh, boy, when I kiss them, they stay kissed.
I'll show you the card.
I don't get it.
Neither do I. There, there.
See that?
Now, how about that, huh?
Yes, he, uh, he must		 have been impressed.
Yeah, but not half as impressed as Joe was this morning.
Joe?
That's my husband.
He's terrible jealous.
I gave him an awful time with that card this morning.
He went storming out of here, fit to kill.
Minnie!
Oh.
Minnie, guess who's got 	 a date tonight with Ricky Ricardo.
I have.
See?
Oh, did you get one, too?
Minnie Oh, girls!
Look what I got in the mail.
Oh!
Look, Ricky Ricardo!
Well, what do you know?
Lucy, you know what?
What?
I'll bet you this is another one of Jerry's crazy publicity stunts.
Do you think that's what it is?
Of course it is.
You don't think Ricky would date those three, do you?
Fred, yes.
Ricky, no.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Good-bye, girls.
So long, kids.
Let me see that again.
Well, I'm gonna keep mine.
Does that feel any better?
Yes, much better.
Thank you, Eleanor.
Ricky, what are you doing home?
What happened?
What's the matter, dear?
We got out of the cab		 and started to go into the club and some man walked up and said, "Are you Ricky Ricardo"?
And I said, "Yes.
" And he said, "This is for Minnie.
" And he hit me.
See?
Minnie?
Whatever did he mean, dear?
I don't know, but it probably has something to do with those postcards that Jerry sent out.
Postcards?
Yeah, he had some crazy idea about sending out the postcards to every woman that had been in the Tropicana and telling them that I was making a date with them for Saturday night.
This guy must have been Minnie's husband, I guess.
Aw, you poor baby.
Imagine not trusting somebody	 that you're married to more than that.
Imagine!
Yeah.
After all, trust is the basis of every happy marriage.
You may quote me.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Lucy?
Oh, good morning, dear.
Good morning.
Lucy, what are you doing?
Lucy?
Pardon me, dear.
A refrigerator, a deep freeze and a chrome dinette set.
Hi, Rick.
Hi, Fred.
Where're you going?
I want to find out what's going on with her.
She keeps running out		 into the back porch, and then she comes in here and talks to somebody		 on the phone.
Well, I'll tell you what's going on.
What?
Some new tenants are moving in.
Oh, who's she talking to	 on the phone?
Ethel.
There's two moving vans down there, one in front and one in back.
She's hanging out the living room window with our phone in her hand.
Ethel's the advance scout	 and Lucy's covering the rear.
Oh, those two characters.
Yeah.
Nothing gets by the snoopers' patrol.
Could I have a bite of breakfast with you?
Ethel's too busy to make mine.
Sure.
Sit down, Fred.
Help yourself.
Thank you.
An automatic washer and an automatic dryer.
A fox stole and a full-length mink coat?
How do you know it's mink?
Has a Saks label in it, huh?
Ethel must be using my binoculars.
Uh-huh.
A green couch and a modern desk.
Got it.
Over and out.
Lucy.
What?
Don't you think you're being a little nosy?
Can I help it if the moving men happen to be bringing something in while I just happen to be on the back porch?
Besides, a little friendly inventory never hurt anyone.
Now, what are you gonna do?
Don't fight it.
Nosiness is just part of a woman's charm like hanging stockings	 in the bathroom and nagging.
Lucy!
There's the other one.
Lucy!
Yeah?
That does it.
They're all moved in in front.
Yeah, they're finished out here, too.
Oh!
If I could just have seen that mink coat.
It was just gorgeous.
Was it?
What do you suppose was in all those big boxes?
I don't know.
Isn't it sneaky of them bringing things in in closed boxes, so we can't see what's in them?
I'll say it is.
Honest to goodness Lucy?
What?
How do you feel?
Fine.
Are you all right, Ethel?
Sure.
Why?
Fred, I'd like to report to you that contrary to what you've always been told, curiosity does not kill a cat.
Oh, you think you're so smart.
What else do you know about them, Ethel?
All I know is that their name is Johnson.
I didn't get a chance		 to ask her anything else.
Well, let's go up and give her the third degree.
I mean, pay her a visit.
You know, if I didn't live here already, I sure wouldn't move in.
I wonder who that is.
Pardon me, could you tell me where I can find Mrs. Mertz?
She isn't in her apartment.
Yeah, she's here.
Won't you come in?
Oh, thank you very much.
I'm Mrs. Johnson, the new tenant.
Oh, Mrs. Johnson!
Oh, come over			 and sit down, dear.
Why, thank you.
I hate to bother you all, but I just wondered		 if Mrs. Mertz had an extra set of keys	 for our apartment.
Yeah, yeah, I'll get her, I'll get her.
Ethel, she's here.
Who?
I got her right in there,	 Mrs. Johnson.
Yeah, come on.
Mrs. Johnson?
What?
Lucy!
What are you gonna do, grill her?
Like a cheese sandwich.
Come on, Rick, we'd better watch this.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Johnson.
I'm glad to see you.
I'd like for you to meet Mr. Ricardo.
And this is my husband, Mr. Mertz.
How do you do?
Charmed, I'm sure.
Mrs. Mertz, honey, could you let me in my apartment?
I'm such a cotton-headed ninny, I locked myself out.
Why certainly, dear.
Fred, go get the other key to Mrs. Johnson's apartment.
I've got a key right here	 in my pocket.
The one that's in our apartment.
All right.
And don't hurry.
This will give us a chance to get acquainted with Mrs. Johnson.
Yes, Mrs. Johnson, if you're going to live here,	 we should know all about you.
Now, we'll tell you		 all about us, and you tell us 		 all about you.
I'll go first.
What does your husband do?
Why, he's in oil.
Hair, suntan,			 cod liver or castor?
Oh, heavens.
We don't mess		 with any of them in Texas.
He's got oil wells.
Oil wells?
Oil wells?
Well, just a couple	 of those little bitty ones.
Well, uh, those little bitty ones, they do pump oil?
Well, not as much		 as you're pumping her, dear.
Mrs. Johnson, I-I-I must apologize for my wife.
Apologize?
Oh Why, we in Texas, just call that being neighborly.
Oh, yeah.
Nancy?
Nancy?
Where are you?
Oh, I'm in here, Sam.
Oh, there you are, my!
Pardon me, folks, I- I don't mean to-to barge in.
That's all right.
Sam, I want you to meet the nicest people.
This is Mrs. Mertz.
How do you do?
How do you do, Mr. Johnson?
And this is Mrs. Ricardo.
How do you do,	 How are you,	 Mr. Johnson?
ma'am?
And Mr. Ricardo.
How are you, sir?
How do you do?
And this is Mr. Mertz.
It's my pleasure, sir.
How are you, sir?
Mr. Johnson, your wife tells us that you dabble in oil wells.
Now, Nancy, honey, I told you not to go around telling people that.
It's not that I'm ashamed of it, but it's just that everybody's always pestering me to-to buy into my new well.
Well, I can certainly understand that, Mr. Johnson.
Yeah, I guess everybody likes to get in on a sure thing like that.
Oh, uh-huh.
But I don't like to-to build up all those nice people's hope and then have to disappoint them.
You see, I only have a few shares left.
Oh?
I wouldn't be selling any shares only, well, doggone it, I like people.
And as long as we had to go extra deep for this gusher, I says to myself, "Sam, why don't you give somebody else a chance to be rich, too"?
Well, come on, Nancy, honey.
We've got to start unpacking.
Here's your key, Mrs. Johnson.
Oh, thank you.
You're very nice people.
Nice meeting you.
Good-bye.
Bye, sir.
Good-bye.
He's got shares to sell.
Wait a minute, everybody!
Now, just hold it		 a minute, everybody.
Let's not get excited		 over nothing.
Nothing?
Mr. Johnson has shares to sell in his oil well.
So?
So get your checkbook!
Are you crazy or something?
Do you think that		 I'm gonna buy oil stock from a perfectly stranger?
Oh, now listen, he looks honest.
I can tell.
He has a kind face and nice eyes.
He's got a kind face		 and nice eyes.
Yeah.
Well, he has.
Look, if he's a millionaire, what is he doing living in this dump?
Dump?
!
Dump?
!
Yeah, to a millionaire, 	 this is a dump.
I accept that.
What's he doing living here?
He already told us why he's living here.
If he lived in a fancy hotel, people would pester him.
Nobody'd think of looking for him here.
Look, honey,			 I don't care what you say.
I don't want any part		 of any oil stock.
Oh!
Tough luck, Lucy.
Fred, this is our		 one big chance.
What are you going		 to do about it?
Are you going to be		 a dumb bunny, too?
Uh, what's up, Doc?
Oh Oh Let's face it, Ethel.
This is our one chance to move on easy street and we're married to a couple of roadblocks.
Now Ricky,	 Now listen, Fred!
listen!
Where have you been?
Oh, eh, out getting a paper.
Oh.
Ricky?
Yeah?
About that oil well Oh, no.
I thought we dropped the subject.
Well, I'm picking it up again.
Listen, I've been thinking maybe that oil stock wouldn't cost us as much as we think.
Now, look, you could take our savings, then I'll pay you back out of the money that I save out of my household account.
Lucy, with the money you save	 out of your household account, we couldn't buy enough oil	 for a salad.
Oh Are you gonna sit there and	 let this opportunity slip by?
Do you think I like being poor?
Do you think I like living	 in this little apartment doing my own housework?
Washing and ironing and cleaning and sweeping and cooking.
: La de da da I wouldn't mind 		 if you couldn't help it, but when I think how you're throwing away the one chance in our lives	 to become millionaires : La de..
Well, I don't care.
I think this is 		 a good opportunity.
Now, look, the subject is closed.
I don't want to hear another word.
The man doesn't have any more stock to sell and that's the end of it.
Why I can't			 make you see that just maybe How do you know he doesn't have any more stock to sell?
Oh, yeah, well, uh I- I didn't think it would hurt anything to find out a little more about the stock, you know.
So, uh, this morning I-I went upstairs and I talked to him and he said that he doesn't have any more left.
That means he must have sold those shares to someone between last night and this morning.
Now, who in the world could it have been?
Fred!
Howdy, partner.
Could you all, uh, spare a dish of coffee for an oil tycoon?
Well, a fine friend you are!
Now, what's the matter?
We wanted to buy that stock.
Well, you didn't sound like it last night.
You didn't either.
Did you tell them, Fred?
Well, Ethel, I hope you're happy now that you jumped our claim.
What are you talking about?
We wanted to buy that stock, as if you didn't know.
How could we know?
Then why did you rush in and change your minds just before we did?
What a sneaky thing to do.
Oh, for goodness sake.
Well, Ricky, when money comes into it, you certainly find out who your friends are.
I wouldn't be surprised if they refused to split with us now.
Split?
Split?
You had just as much chance	 to buy it as we did.
Yes, Lucy, Fred is right.
We had just as much chance	 to buy it as they did.
We just have			 to face it, honey, the Mertzes will be rich,	 and we'll still be poor.
Oh, now, don't go putting on a poor mouth.
Well, maybe someday they'll invite us to their penthouse.
'Course I don't mind so much for myself.
I was just thinking about poor little Ricky.
That money could have gone for his college education.
Well, that's certainly hitting a rich godmother below my money belt.
Poor little Ricky.
Yeah.
My son.
Yeah.
Oh, all right,			 all right.
We'll split it			 with you.
That's wonderful!
Fred, you're a pal!
That's the least		 I could do, I guess.
Now, we've got ten shares,	 and we'll give you one.
That really is the least you can do.
All right, two.
Okay, three.
We have three.
Do I hear four?
Four.
We have four.
Do I hear five?
Five.
Oh, now,			 just a minute.
Oh, come on, Fred.
Yeah, Fred.
What's five shares		 to a big oil typhoon like you?
That's tycoon.
All right, then,		 you can have five.
Do I hear six?
Lucy Oh, I'm just kidding.
That's really very generous of you, Fred.
I wish there were some way that we could repay you.
Well, there is.
You can pay me		 for the five shares.
Oh.
Write him out a check, Ricky.
How much is it, Fred?
$600.
$600?
Oh, what's the difference, honey?
In a week or so, we'll all be millionaires.
Sure.
All right, partner!
We'll all be rich.
In a week or so!
Good mornin', Lucy-Lu.
Hi, Ethel, honey.
Are those new furs?
No.
They're yesterday's.
Oh.
How much did they cost?
Does Rockefeller tell DuPont?
I got them on approval just like you did that mink coat.
Yeah.
How do you like my hat?
Oh, I like it.
It's dreamy.
I got a new hat, too.
Let me see it.
Aw Oh, that is really wonderful.
My, let me see the top of That's great.
Howdy, folks.
Howdy.
Hi, Fred.
How do you like those furs?
Pretty classy, huh?
Oh, yeah.
They're wonderful.
You know, I think I'm gonna	 like being a millionaire.
Millionaire, millionaire.
You know,			 I've said it so often that it doesn't 		 mean much anymore.
You know something?
What?
We might even get to be billionaires.
Yeah, or even trillionaires.
Or even zillionaires.
Yeah, or even What comes after zillionaires?
The income tax department.
Oh, Fred.
Lucy!
Yeah, we're in here, Tex.
Tex?
I mean Cube.
You drill any more wells today, partner?
Hiya, partner.
Good mornin', Ricky.
Don't you think you're going a little too far?
Well, now, how do you expect us to dress if we're going to be Texas oillionaires?
Well, I don't know, but my father always told me, "Never cross your chickens before your bridges is hatched.
" What was that?
What was that again?
You know what it means.
It means, tha-that don't go spending your money before you get it.
"Don't go spending your money before you get it.
"  : "Don't go spending your money before you get it.
" Hello.
Oh.
Oh, yes, I see.
Oh, yes, I'll tell Mr. Ricardo.
Yes.
Well?
That man wanted me to tell you that your custom-built, periwinkle-blue Cadillac would cost $12,000.
And, yes, they could fix the horn to play "Babaloo.
" Oh, look who isn't spending his money.
Well, I was just digging up	 a little bit of information, that's all.
You don't see me spending my money before I know, I know.
" before your bridges is hatched.
"  $12,000!
Periwinkle blue.
How do you like that?
Somebody's at the door.
Good afternoon.
Oh, hello.
Say, do you know where I can find the mana?
Hi, Fred.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Ken.
Say, have you got a fella living in the building by the name of Johnson?
Yeah, he's upstairs in 4-B.
I rang there.
I guess they must not be home.
Well, is there anything I can do for you?
No, no.
I just want to talk with him about some oil stock.
Oh?
Yeah.
I'll catch him later.
So long, folks.
So long.
So long.
Hey, he looks familiar.
Yeah, who is he?
Yeah.
He's a detective.
We must be in on a pretty good deal.
If he's going to buy some of the stock, it must be okay.
Suppose he doesn't want 	 to see Mr. Johnson about buying the stock?
Well, what other reason would he want to see We have been swindled!
Sure!
I knew the minute		 I laid eyes on that man that he was a crook.
You said he had a kind face!
Yeah, I didn't say what kind.
Well, there goes all our hard-earned money.
How do you like that?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
There must be some way		 out of this.
After all, he promised us a big gusher would come in any day.
Yeah.
Well, we don't have any proof that he said that.
We have to have evidence.
Evidence?
Evidence?
That's what we got		 to get- evidence.
Oh, that's gonna to be a little hard to find.
We got to get some.
What do I know about oil?
I got to get mixed up		 with this character here.
We got to prove 		 what he said right Watch out where you're going!
Well, don't get mad at me.
I'm in this just as much as you are.
You are in this exactly as much as we are.
No wonder you wanted to unload	 all those shares on us.
Unload?
!
Unload?
!
Well, maybe unload is not the right word.
But, after all, Fred, we all know how you are 	 with your money.
And it was pretty obvious	 the way you begged us to take the stock		 off your hands.
We begged you?
!
See, he admits it.
Come on, Fred.
Let's get out of here.
That's the thanks we get.
Yeah.
If you're the kind of people we would have had to associate with if we were millionaires, I'm glad we were wiped out!
Ethel.
I'm not speaking to you.
I know, I'm not speaking to you either, but this is an emergency.
Can we have a five-minute truce?
I know how we can get		 our money back.
How?
How?
See this			 tape recorder?
Yeah.
Ricky said we needed evidence.
Now, I am going to get		 Mr. Johnson to repeat everything that he promised us about the oil wells.
Oh, he won't say a word if he sees that recorder.
Naturally.
You are going			 to hide out in the hall and run the recorder.
Now, look.
See this microphone?
I have it hidden right here.
Yeah.
Look at that.
Uh-huh.
I have the wire run down inside my slacks, see?
Gee.
Listen, Ethel,		Oh.
if this works, we won't have any reason	 to be mad at each other anymore.
Shall we do it right now?
Yeah.
Come on.
I have to carry	 this up in the hall There.
It's all plugged in.
Now I have to put this in here.
Now, when I get inside, you press this button and turn this to this side.
Okay.
Okay.
And then let the cord out as I move around the apartment.
Now, when I get all the evidence I need, and I'm ready to leave, I'll jerk on the cord twice like this.
Yeah.
See?
And then you reel me in fast because I'll be ready to come out.
Okay.
Okay.
Now, listen.
Keep the cord very taut so that you'll know when I'm ready.
Keep it taut.
Okay, all right.
Don't give me any slack.
No, I won't.
Hello.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo.
Won't you come in?
Thank you.
Sam, we've got company.
You have to excuse		 the way I look.
I was just doing some more	 of our unpacking.
Well, that's all right.
Well, well, howdy, little lady!
Hello, Mr. Johnson.
I hope you don't mind my dropping in like this, but I wanted to talk to you.
Glad to have you any time at all.
Excuse me.
I'll continue my unpacking.
Certainly.
Mr. Johnson, it's just that I'm terribly worried about the oil stock we bought from you.
Well, honey child, don't let it bother your pretty little redhead.
No, sir, that oil stock 	 is just as safe as U.S. government bonds.
And in no time at all, you Uh would you repeat that, please?
Huh?
I said, would you repeat that, please, just to reassure me?
Well, I said those oil stocks was as safe			 as U.S. government bonds.
Uh-huh.
And in no time at all, you'll be rolling in money.
Oh, that's right.
As soon as that well comes in, You won't be able to count the money, it'll come in so fast.
Have you any idea how much money we'll be making?
Oh, you ought to get back	 your investment, oh, I would say,		 a hundred times over.
Why, the fact of the matter	 is, Mrs. Ricardo, I wouldn't worry none.
After all, I wouldn't		 let you invest in a well that wasn't gonna come in.
Uh, Mrs. Ricardo are you all right?
Oh, yes, yes, I'm all right.
I'm just a little nervous, I guess, about all the money I've invested.
Well, now, honey child, you don't need			 to worry none.
No?
Mercy no.
You can trust Sam.
Well, I've been in this game	 a long time, Mrs. Ricardo, and I've seen a lot		 of wells in my day, but I look for this well	 to be a real lollapalooza.
Why, do you know, Mrs. Ricardo?
Unless I miss my guess How's that?
I said unless			 I miss my guess, this little baby		 is gonna gush like no gusher			 ever gushed before.
Uh, uh, whoa!
What's going on here?
Well, what's that cord?
Oh, Ethel, all right, Ethel!
Ethel, stop!
Ethel!
I'll tell you what's going on.
We have all the evidence we need on a tape recorder out in the hall.
Evidence?
Yes, evidence.
Evidence that you two	 are trying to swindle us.
Swindle?
!
Now, wait a minute.
Our money, or we are going to the police.
Now, you're making		 a big mistake.
Our money, please.
Why, that well's liable 	 to come in anytime.
Are you gonna give us our money or will we take this recording to the police?
Now, just a minute, ma'am.
Down Texas way, 		 a deal is a deal.
Our money, please.
Sam, if that's the way she feels, give her back her nasty little old money.
All right, honey pot.
Thank you very much.
All right, Ethel, reel me in!
Uh Ethel, slack up a bit.
Well, here's to the smartest, cleverest, little wife in the whole world.
Hear!
Hear!
It really wasn't anything.
Oh, let him tell all about it again.
I like to hear it.
Well, so do I. Well, I tell you, honey, that was the greatest idea you ever had.
Oh, thank you.
We're all out of this mess, and we owe it all to you.
Well Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Shh What's the matter?
Fred, that sounds like our buzzer.
Go see if somebody's at our door.
All right.
I didn't know you could hear our buzzer in here.
Sure.
How do we know		 when you have company?
Oh, Ken.
Oh, there you are.
We're over here.
Oh, say, I wonder if I could use your phone a moment.
Use ours.
Oh, thanks, thanks.
This one can't wait.
I I just made the greatest greatest buy in my life from that from that Johnson fella.
You bought something from Mr. Johnson?
Yeah, yeah.
Oil stock.
Honey, honey, I got it.
Yeah, for a while there, I thought it was going to be too late.
Yeah, but-but Mr. Johnson said that some dopes returned	 the block of stock to him, and he sold it to me five minutes before we got a wire saying they struck oil.
Yeah, you can get that mink coat now.
Ha, ha, ha!
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.
And open up that champagne.
I'll be right home.
Good-bye.
Thanks a lot, folks.
La de la da da da de de.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi.
Where's Little Ricky?
He's still asleep.
Was he good?
Oh, he was just perfect.
What a disposition that kid has.
Just wonderful.
Just like his old man.
Oh, he's a little angel all right.
Wait till you see what I bought.
Lucy, not another hat.
Now, don't say a word until you've seen it.
Now, don't you think that's the most beautiful hat you've ever seen?
Yeah, I think it's great.
You do?
Mm-hmm.
You know, frankly, I never	 have liked that hat on you.
What's the matter, honey?
You never like my new hats.
You always like my old ones better, so this time I put my old one in the box and I wore my new one.
You dirty double-crosser.
I never can seem to outsmart you.
Aw, you're such a clever husband.
Oh You should have seen your face when I said I didn't like your new hat.
Yeah, I guess it was pretty funny all right.
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait just a minute.
I didn't say you could keep it.
How much is it?
Well, you just keep on laughing, honey.
How much is it?
Oh, come on now, honey.
Come on, Lucy.
You're in			 such a good mood.
Why spoil it?
Lucy Look, if I tell you now, you'll just get mad.
There's no sense	 in you losing your temper every time I bring something home.
Why don't you wait till the bills come in for everything and get mad all at once?
Now look, I'm not going to lose my temper.
No?
Just let me see the price tag.
No.
Lucy No.
Now, look, look, look.
Isn't this beautiful?
Don't you think it's worth almost any amount of money?
No.
No?
Well Price tag.
Como te vas pagar 49.50 Now, now, now, honey por sombrero!
Honey, you said 		 you weren't going to get mad.
That was before I knew how much it cost!
But it's such a beautiful hat,	 and I needed it.
Needed it?
!
Yes.
You got a closet full of hats.
I haven't either.
Ha!
Huh!
What are you doing?
What do these look like?
Well, they do look like hats, don't they?
Yeah, they do look like hats.
But none of those		 look good on me.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Now, this is a lovely little hat, look at that.
And look at this one.
This is one of my favorites of all times.
Look at that hat there!
And this hat- this is a Jim Dandy here.
Look at that one.
And this is a beauty.
Look.
Now, what, there you are.
Now, isn't that the most ridiculous thing you've ever seen in your whole life?
You got a fortune invested in each one of these hats, and now none of them look good on you.
You only got one head.
Why do you buy so many hats?
And don't cry.
I don't like it when you cry.
Don't do that!
I should never have married a hot-blooded Cuban.
I should have married a cold-blooded Swede.
Now don't cry!
Every time			 I spend a little money, you lose your temper.
What do you mean I lose my temper?
!
I never lose my temper!
Well, you're the first person	 I ever saw whose veins bulge just because they have		 a good disposition.
Go look at yourself.
Go on.
Take a look.
See?
Hello?
May I speak to Mr. Ricardo, please?
Uh, just a minute.
It's for you.
Hello!
Hello, Ricky, this is Morris Williams.
Yeah?
I lined up			 a ventriloquist for you.
Oh, good.
I've been going 		 over the act with him, and he's perfect		 for what you want.
Yeah?
Besides, he's the only ventriloquist available in town.
Uh-huh.
His name's Sir Hume.
Oh, yes, yes, Sir Hume.
I know his act.
Now, about price I also know that he was getting $250 a week at the Domino Club.
Well, now, his price is $500.
$500?
!
What's the matter with you?
You think I'm crazy or something?
Temper, temper.
Oh, listen, don't give me that.
I haven't got any temper.
I just don't like to be rooked, that's all.
$500 A week.
That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard in my life.
Well, uh, wait a minute.
Let me check with my client.
We got him.
He's blowing his top.
Look, I want that job.
Yeah, he needs food.
My voice is getting weak.
Let me handle this.
I know my psychology.
Besides, you're the only act in town that can do this and he knows it.
Sorry, Ricky.
That's our price.
All right, I'll give you till tomorrow noon to come to your senses.
Good-bye.
Quinientos pesos una semana para un dummy			 y ventriloquist!
Now temper, temper.
And don't say, "Temper, temper.
" Oh, you're right, there's	 no sense in my fighting it.
And it's just part of your personality- big brown eyes, black wavy hair and a lousy disposition.
You couldn't keep		 from losing your temper if your life depended on it.
What do you mean I couldn't keep from See?
losing my See?
Look, I- I'm just not going to fight it anymore, dear.
I'm just going to accept it.
Well, maybe you're right.
Nobody's perfect.
I got to accept you with all your faults, too.
That's right, dear.
That's the only sensible way	 to look at it.
After all What do you mean		 "all my faults"?
!
Like your 'stravaganzis.
What "'stravaganzis"?
You couldn't keep from buying a new hat if your life depended on it and it may.
I could, too.
I could keep from buying	 a new hat for a a a month.
How much would you like to bet?
$49.50.
$49.50?
How do you arrive at that figure?
There's a hat I want to buy	 with my winnings.
Uh-huh, Well 	uh-huh.
See?
All right, then I'll		 give you a better bet.
I'll bet you $49.50 that I can	 keep from buying a hat longer than you can keep from-from losing your temper.
Okay.
You got yourself a bet.
All right.
Starting right now.
Well, in just a minute, dear.
Take that hat back!
What do you think I am, made of money?
!
We'll start from now on.
Oh, come now.
I bought that hat before we made the bet, so I get to keep it.
Now, just a minute.
I have to pay for it after we made the bet, so it goes back.
I won't take it back!
What do you think of that?
!
I Oh, no, you're not gonna catch me as easy as that.
Take it back, dear.
I won't.
Yes, you will.
It's an order.
Take it back.
No.
You must.
I don't must.
I'm sorry you have to take it back.
Yeah, well  What's the matter?
Oh, look, Lucy, they're having a half-price sale.
Oh!
If I look, I'm lost.
Just lead me in, Ethel.
I'll return the hat and get it over with.

Wouldn't you know it, today?
Here's the door now.
Look out.
Oh, heavens!
Hello, Mrs. Mulford.
Hello, Mrs. Mulford.
Why, Mrs. Ricardo, what's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm just fighting temptation.
I don't want to see		 all the goodies.
Huh?
She bet her husband that she wouldn't buy another new hat.
Oh.
I have to return this one.
You mean that adorable hat	 you bought yesterday?
Please, don't torture me.
Just take it back.
Come on, Ethel.
Let's get out of here.
Well Okay.

Pearls!
And it's a lovely shade 	 of turquoise.
Oh, no, not turquoise!

I love turquoise!
Lucy, Lucy, it's just an ordinary shade of blue.

It's an original.
I got to have it!
Oh!
Oh, isn't it adorable?

Oh, Ethel,			 look at it.
Oh, Mrs. Mulford, won't this look wonderful on me?
Please, Mrs. Ricardo, don't ask me that.
You know I never try	 to influence my customers.
Oh.
Will you take it with you?
Yes.
Uh, I mean, no.
Send it out tomorrow.
'Course.
Oh, and be very careful 	 of it, Mrs. Mulford.
Oh, I will.
Oh.
Come on, Ethel.
I got a lot of work to do.
I got to make Ricky lose his temper before they deliver that hat tomorrow.
Hi, honey.
Hi, dear.
Oh, what a night.
Tough, huh?
Yeah.
What are you doing up		 so late?
Oh, I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd read for a while.
Oh.
How did everything go at the club?
Terrible.
I made everybody		 come back and rehearse.
That's why I'm so late.
Oh.
Gee, that's right, it's 4:00.
Yeah.
You didn't lose your temper, did you, dear?
No.
That's good.
You take			 your hat back?
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'm dead tired.
Dead tired, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm ready 		 to drop.
Just ready to drop, poor baby.
Good night, honey.
Good night, dear.
Sweet dreams.
Sleep tight.
What's that?

What's that?

What's that?
!
What's the matter, dear?
Is it too loud?
What?
!
Huh?
!
Is it too loud?
Is it too loud?
!
No, no, it isn't too loud.
I just thought 	 it might disturb the neighbors.
Oh, oh, well, I'll turn it off, then, dear.
That was very thoughtless of me.
Thank you very much.
That's all right, honey.
Good night, dear.
Good night.
Please, please, please, please.
I- I can hear that all the way over here.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
Oh, I won't do it anymore.

I'm very sorry.
That's all right.
That's all right.
Good night, dear.

Something wrong?

Everything's lovely.
You sure			 you don't want a cracker?
No, I don't want one, no.
Good night, dear.
Good-good night.
Nuts?
Not right now.
Well, you let me know.
Yeah.
Sorry, honey.
7:30.
Got to have the sheets		 for the laundry man.
Lucy.
Yes, dear?
I know what you are trying to do but it's not going to work.
Hmm!
I was only trying to help, dear.
You never can find your slippers in the morning, so I nailed them to the floor.
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis, siete, ocho, nueve, diez It was very thoughtful of you.
Lucy.
Did you get it?
Here it is.
Has he lost his temper yet?
No, and I'm			 in a terrible mess.
That hat's gonna		 be delivered any minute.
I hope this works.
Oh, it'll work.
You see that design, those leaves?
Yeah.
Well, there's a hole in the cut there in the middle of each leaf.
Oh, yeah.
Now, you fill that up with liquid and when he drinks it, it dribbles all over him.
Oh, boy, and he's wearing	 a white dinner jacket!
A white dinner jacket?
Yeah.
He's taking publicity pictures.
That's what			 gave me the idea.
Oh, what a break.
I think tomato juice might look just ducky on that white coat.
Don't go beyond that line.
Why?
See?
It'll all spill out before he gets a chance to drink it.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Uh, Ricky!
I'll see you later.
Where are you going?
I don't want to be here when he blows his Cuban top.
Ricky!
Yeah?
Lunch is ready.
All right.
Sit right down, dear.
Thank you.
What's the matter?
I don't trust you.
I apologize.
What is this?
!
Well, it's, uh, it looks	 like toma tomato juice, dear.
It's a lovely shade of red, isn't it?
Hi.
Hello, Fred.
Who shot him?
Nobody.
Well, did he cut his throat?
No.
He dribbled tomato juice	 all over himself.
Oh.
Well, has he lost his temper yet?
No.
Still under control.
Good.
Ricky, I brought back your golf club that I borrowed.
I was practicing in Central Park and a tree jumped in front of me.
Hello.
Hello, this is Morris.
Is Ricky there?
Uh, just a moment.
It's somebody named Morris.
Tell him I'm not home.
Uh, he's right here.
Just a second.
Hello?
Hello, Ricky, we've thought it over carefully and he can't do it		 for less than $500.
I see.
Well, if that's the man's price, that's the man's price.
Unfortunately, I can't afford it.
Uh, is this Ricky Ricardo?
Yes, this is Ricky Ricardo.
Well, look, maybe 500 is a lot of money.
Let me check with my client.
He didn't even raise his voice.
He must have somebody else.
Listen, I want you to get me that job at any price.
Uh, Ricky, just because of his great personal regard for you, he says he'll do it for 350.
I'm sorry, we'll just have to forget it.
No.
Okay.
We'll do it for 250.
Well, you know as a matter of fact, I only have $200 left for that act.
$200?
You know he gets 250 everywhere he works.
All right, all right,	 I don't want to be unfair.
I'll give you 250.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
All right.
Good-bye.
What happened?
Nothing.
Was it bad?
No, no, no.
As a matter of fact, it's very good.
Oh?
Yeah.
I just I just learned a wonderful lesson.
Oh, you did?
Yes, sir.
I didn't lose my temper and I saved $250.
Well, that's wonderful!
And you know something else?
What?
I owe it all to you.
To me?
That's right.
So, I'm going to buy you a new hat.
Well what about the bet?
Oh, forget about the bet.
Honey, from now on, I'm going to be the happiest, calmest man in the whole world.
Well, honey, that's wonderful.
Well, I'll, I'll call up and-and order the hat		 that I want.
No.
Look, go around, shop for a while.
I'll buy you any hat you want.
Oh, well, I know the hat	 that I want, dear, and I'll, I'll call up and I'll have them send it over on their fastest delivery.
Okay, sweetheart.
Well Hello.
Hello, Mrs. Mulford.
This is Mrs. Ricardo.
Yes.
Mrs. Mulford, do you know that darling little turquoise hat with the pearls that I liked so much yesterday?
Yes.
Would you put that on my charge and send it out, please?
Yes, on your fastest, speediest delivery.
Thank you very much.
Well, they certainly		 have fast delivery.
They-they have			 very good service there.
Yeah, that's the one		 I ordered all right.
Lucy.
Yes, sir?
When did you buy this hat?
How's that?
When did you buy this hat?
Remember,			 you learned your lesson.
I remember.
When did you buy the hat?
Yesterday afternoon.
Yesterday afternoon?
Yes, sir.
You bought the hat yesterday afternoon?
Yeah.
That means that you lost the bet yesterday.
Yes, I guess it does.
And you made me go through all that torture for nothing.
Yeah, I guess  Yeah.
Oh, that's a killer.
Ah!
Oh, oh, Ricky!
Ricky!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Ethel, I thought we were going over to the Ricardos' tonight.
We are.
I'm ready.
All right.
Come on.
You'd better take your glasses with you.
What for?
I know what Lucy and Ricky look like.
Suppose Ricky wants to show us his home movies again.
He wouldn't dare.
He's been showing them to us every night.
Well, after all, it's his first movie camera and the first pictures he's got of the baby.
Well, count me out.
If I want to see old movies, I can stay home and watch television.
Well, what can we do?
I'll tell you what we'll have to do.
Don't let the conversation lag.
Don't even give them a chance to suggest showing the movies.
Hey, that's a good idea.
Now, just remember, here's what you've got to do-- just keep talking and talking and talking and talking.
You know, act normal.
No, no, no, I take that back.
I need you on my team tonight.
Now, get in there and fight and keep those lips moving.
Lucy?
Yeah?
Aren't the Mertzes coming over tonight?
Yeah.
They said they were.
What do you think is holding them up?
Gee, I don't know.
They ought to be here any minute.
There they are.
Oh, good.
I'm glad you came.
Hello.
I wanted to Wasn't this a wonderful day?
Hi.
Oh, It sure was.
particularly at this time of year.
Uh-huh.
What were you doing today, Rick?
Uh, I I was pretty busy puttering around the apartment.
Then I went over to the drugstore and got an ice cream soda.
An "all around strawberry" soda.
That's a soda with strawberry flavor and strawberry ice cream.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Pretty good.
Yeah.
They sure are.
Uh, I had an idea How are you, Lucy?
Fine.
And what's new?
Nothing.
I had an idea that maybe Fred, Fred, there's something I've been wanting to ask you.
Well, what is it, Ethel?
Uh how are you, Fred?
Fine.
How are you?
Oh, pretty good.
I don't think either one of you are well.
I had an idea that maybe tonight Oh, look!
Lucy's got some delicious new candy.
Want a piece, Fred?
Yeah.
Okay, there you are.
I guess I'll have a piece, too.
Ethel, those are just those same old caramels you gave us for Christmas.
I had an idea, like I was saying, you know that what-what maybe you would like to do tonight, and I thought you'd like to see the pictures of I took of the baby.
Oh, honey, Ethel and Fred don't want to see those pictures again.
What are you talking about?
They're pictures of their godson.
Oh, Ricky, we'd really love to see them, but it hurts our eyes to look at them on that old wrinkled sheet you use for a screen.
Oh?
Outside of that, we'd be delighted to see them.
Oh.
You see?
You see?
Now, the reason I wanted you to see them again is because I wanted you to see them in this new screen I bought today.
Wait till you see them in that!
Go get your glasses, Fred.
I'll watch without them.
You can't see without them.
I know what I'm doing.
I got it all set up just in case you asked to see them again.
Fred, uh, ge-ge-ge-get-get-get rid of your head, will you?
What do you want me to do-- take it off?
I mean, you know, move it over.
All right, all right.
Turn the lights off, honey.
Yeah.
Here we go!
This would have been a good shot if Lucy just didn't argue with me.
Doesn't he look cute?
Look at that.
A pretty good close-up.
You know, this one was a great idea but things moving that fast are pretty tough.
Ah, how's that, huh?
How's that for a moving shot?
Right through the bedroom and into the nursery.
Have you ever seen anything better than that in real movies?
Huh?
Look at the way that focuses all the way.
You can see them in the mirror in the back.
See the mirror in the back there?
This would have been great if I hadn't tripped over the baby's wagon.
This is a great way to get killed-- just take a picture of your wife when she wakes up in the morning.
Ooh!
Now, the next ten minutes of film is just as good as anyone has ever taken.
I don't want to brag, but, uh, : I think that I learned pretty fast.
: And as Lucy holds up little Ricky and waves good-bye, we say a reluctant farewell to the Ricardo apartment and its charming inhabitants.
This is a Ricky Ricardo production!
: Bum bum bum bum bum bum!
That's all.
You know, they're very good, considering that those are the first pictures that I Lucy.
More!
More!
Dear, those were really wonderful.
Don't you think so, Eth?
Ethel?
Fred?
Ew  Oh!
Oh, you What's the matter with you two scaring me to death?
We wanted to be sure the coast is clear.
Is Ricky very mad?
I'll say.
He wouldn't even talk to me this morning.
We're the ones who sneaked out.
What's he mad at you for?
Yeah.
I fell asleep.
Oh, no.
Good morning.
Good morning!
Good-bye.
Now, Ricky, wait a minute.
We're sorry.
We really liked your movies.
We want to see them again!
Tonight!
Don't we, Fred?
Yeah!
Yeah!
My, but you sound sincere.
Well, I mean it.
Oh, sure.
I do!
I'm just dying to see those lousy movies again.
Fred, that's a terrible thing to say.
Ricky put a lot of time and effort into those lousy movies-- those movies.
Oh, now, Ricky, they didn't mean that.
Look, you don't have to worry about me.
You don't have to see any of the movies that I take ever again, including the TV pilot film that I'm just about to audition.
Oh, Fred, what's the matter with you?
That's a fine thing TV pilot film?
What were you saying about a TV pilot film?
Nothing that concerns you.
I was going to make one using the three of you as actors, but I have changed my mind about the supporting cast.
Adios, amigos.
Now, wait a minute, Ricky!
You have fixed the sheets and blankets.
Now go take a nap.
What did he mean by that?
Yeah.
He was trying to say you have made your bed, now lie in it.
Hi.
Hi.
Well, I hope you are satisfied.
Huh?
Now what?
Remember that TV pilot film Ricky was going to make?
Remember it?
We've all been nice to him for days, so he'd use us in it.
Yeah, well, we can all go back to being our normal, nasty selves.
He's already made it.
What?
And next week the most important man in television, Mr. Bennett Green is coming over to look at it.
Well, we certainly muffed that one.
What do you mean, "we"?
You were the ones who tippy-toed out in the middle of our home movies.
You should talk, sleepytime gal!
That's telling her, Ethel.
Now, don't you be smart, Fred.
You're the one who really clinched the whole thing with your diplomatic remark: "Sure, I'm just dying to see those lousy movies again".
Ah, just a minute.
Oh, really, Fred.
Oh, you two now, stop squabbling.
The main thing is, what can we do about it?
Nothing.
We're not in it, so that's that.
Yeah.
As an old Cuban philosopher once said, "We have plugged in the electric blanket.
Now let's take the snooze".
Well, it's too bad, but it's just one of those things.
I guess so.
I'm not so sure.
Hey, just a minute.
We forgot Miss Never-say-die.
Lucy, what are you planning?
What are you thinking?
What's going on?
We'll make our own TV film.
Our own?
Our own?
Yeah, we'll make it just like Ricky did.
We'll use his film, his camera, his lights his wife, and if they play their cards right, his wife's friends.
And then when Mr. Bennett Green comes over, he'll see a double feature.
What kind of a film will we make?
Um a Western drama.
Hey.
That's a wonderful idea.
We'll get a name later.
Right now we have a lot to think about.
We have to get costumes, scenery, have to find out who shoots who Oh, boy!
Look at this, Fred.
Isn't this great?
This is fixed up great.
Yeah?
Hey, Lucy!
Here we are.
Hi, pard.
I can't get over how cute you got the room fixed up.
Well, I worked pretty hard painting those figures.
They look almost real, don't they?
Look at that one.
Well, I've had moments when real people looked like that.
Come on, we got to get started.
We got to get all this finished and out of the way before Ricky gets home.
Okay.
What's that thing?
That's a projector.
I know.
It's a new kind.
You put the sound right on the film, like a tape recorder.
Oh.
Fred, now, for the first part, you take the picture.
You look right through this little red thing here, and then you press this button right here, see?
See that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You press that down.
What's this little dial here for?
It says "8, 16, 32, 64".
Gee, I don't know.
Well, take a little bit of each number and see what happens.
Okay.
Ready, Ethel?
Yep.
Stand back here.
Remember how we did it.
Okay.
Roll 'em.
Lights, camera, action, quiet!
!
What's that for?
I went to a studio in Hollywood once.
That's the way they make pictures.
Oh.
Fred, turn on the phonograph.
I'm an old cowhand From the Rio Grande And my legs ain't bowed And my teeth ain't capped I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow Never roped a steer 'cause I don't know how And I sure ain't fixin' to find out now Yippee i-o-ki-ay Yee-ha!

Ya-ka-ta-ka-ha Whee!
Ya-ka-ta-ka-ha.
Yee-ha!
You know that looked pretty good?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now we do the big, dramatic part of the show.
Now, Fred, don't forget, you make an entrance from over there.
Well, who's going to run the camera if I'm off the scene?
Oh, well, we set that on automatic, see?
We-we push this button right here and the camera takes a picture by itself.
I got it.
Okay, now, Ethel, don't forget where we stopped.
Oh, I got it.
All right, here we go.
Roll 'em, Fred!
How about a game of draw poker, Tex?
Don't mind if I do, Nevada.
Cigarette?
Yep.
Hold it!
I didn't cut them cards.
Are you accusin' me of cheatin'?
Yep, I'm accusin' you of cheatin'.
Smile when you say that.
Yep, I'm accusing you of cheatin'.
No man can say that to me.
Smile when you say that.
No man can say that to me.
Reach for the ceiling, both of ya!
Drop them guns!
You're under arrest!
We ain't got nothin' on us.
You're the ones that robbed the stage, you mangy polecats.
How did you find out?
I got wind of it.
All right, I am taking you to the clink.
Get goin'!
Pick it up there!
Cut!
Oh, boy, that was good, wasn't it?
I say so.
I hope that camera didn't run out of film.
Don't worry Film?
Lucy.
Well, that was a good dress rehearsal.
Now I'll put in the film.
Lucy?
Oh, the film came!
Why didn't you wait for me?
Who's got time to wait for you?
I got to get this stuff spliced together.
How's it look?
Look at this.
Oh, look at Fred in that outfit!
Look at you in those chaps.
Hey, that mustache looks better on film on you than it did really, didn't it?
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
Doesn't that look great?
Great.
Ricky!
Um wh-what are you doing here?
I live here, remember?
Uh, I thought you weren't coming home to dinner.
I didn't come home for dinner.
I just came over to pick up my guitar.
What are these pictures?
Uh I asked, "What are these pictures"?
Would you believe it if I told you they were taken by a sidewalk photographer?
No.
No?
Well, uh I might as well tell you the truth.
Um, a talent scout called us from Hollywood and-and he came over here with all of his equipment and-and he took pictures of all of us while we were, uh because he Go on.
Go on.
I can't.
I don't even believe it myself.
Well, all right, I'll tell you, Ricky.
We got mad at you because you wouldn't let us be in your TV film, so we made one of our own.
So, you show your film to Mr. Green and we'll show ours.
Mr. Green is a very busy man.
He will only have time to see one film.
Well, that's very sweet of you, dear, but when will he see yours?
You know what I mean.
You won't show your film to anybody tomorrow night.
Now, just a minute.
We put a lot of time and money into this film.
What are we gonna do with it?
Well, just show it to each other while I'm running my boring baby pictures.
Hasta la vista.
Well, that's that.
Oh, no, it isn't.
Our picture will be shown and what's more, Ricky will be showing it.
What are you gonna do, switch reels?
No.
I'm gonna cut our picture into Ricky's.
I'm gonna figure out a way to use the best parts of both.
Give me Ricky's film in the closet there.
Put this back on here now.
Where is it?
Up on the top shelf.
All those reels up there.
Lucy, Ricky and Mr. Green just got out of the cab.
Yeah, well, everything's all ready.
I just finished.
Here.
Fred, put this on the projection machine right away.
Right.
Oh, I hope it's all right.
I did it in such a hurry.
Here, pick all this stuff up.
Here you are, Mr. Green.
Oh, hi!
Hello.
Hello.
Mr. Green, this is my wife, Lucy.
How do you do, Mr. Green?
Very nice to know you.
This is our neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Mertz.
How do you do?
Hi, Mr. Green.
How are you?
Uh, Mr. Green is very busy, so he just has time to see the film and then he has to leave right away.
You know how demanding television is.
Oh, I certainly do, Mr. Green.
That's quite all right.
Well, I know that you're looking for some unusual shows and this film is liable to be the biggest surprise of the year.
You can say that again.
Well, uh, won't you sit down, Mr. Green?
Thank you.
Sit right over there, Mr. Green.
That's it right over there.
I'll get everything settled here.
Lucy, would you turn out the light, please?
Yeah, I will.
Check this back here.
Get set.
Okay, here we go!
The pastry chef at the club made that for me.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

Well, well.
Mr. Green, I-I-I just don't know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Just let me have it.
It's terrific.
What?
The funniest thing I've ever seen.
Such imagination.
Most people would make a straight dull musical show, but you added all those delightful touches of comedy.
You liked it, huh?
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, you were wonderful!
And the, and the Mertzes were just great.
Oh, thank you, thank you!
Thank you very much.
Mrs. Ricardo, you're married to a genius.
Oh.
Yes, I know.
How did you ever think of it, dear?
I don't know.
Just came to me.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Yeah?
"U-7 " No.
Oh.
"R"?
R- R-R.

"R-1-1 " no.

"V-O-9-1 " No.
No?
Hi.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Oh, we're checking dollar bills with the bonus bucks in the paper.
Oh, you're still not doing that.
Certainly.
There's one worth $300 this week and I am going to win it.
Lucy, there are eight million people in New York City, and who knows how many one-dollar bills.
What makes you think you're gonna win?
I can't miss.
All my life, I've been eating oysters and never found a pearl.
Five years in a row, I didn't win the Irish Sweepstakes, and only yesterday at the grocery, I missed guessing the number of beans in the jar by two.
This time it's my turn.
Well, I didn't know all that.
I mean, you're a cinch.
And if it isn't her turn, it certainly is mine.
That's right.
Yeah.
What's the matter with you, Rick?
Don't you realize this is a sure thing?
Now let's go.
Okay.
Yeah, I didn't realize it.
Okay.
"X".
"X," yeah.
"X-6-4 " "X-6-4 " "3 " "3"!
"8 " "8"!
"9 " "9"!
"1"!
Couldn't you have made that "one" a seven?
Give me a pen and I will.
Do we dare?
Oh, no.
The paper would frown on that.
The Treasury Department would make a face, too.
Well, come on, Ethel.
Give me the next one.
That's all.
Oh.
Well, another day, another no dollar.
Yeah, darn it.
Oh, wait a minute.
We didn't go through the boys' money.
Ethel went through mine years ago.
I mean the money in your pockets.
Give me yours, Ricky.
Look, no use going through mine.
I found a pearl in an oyster once.
It's not my turn to win either.
I found a diamond ring in a box of Cracker Jack.
Oh, now, stop!
You stop joking.
He's not joking.
Where do you think he got this?
Well, I don't care what you two do, but we're gonna win.
Come on, let's go get some more, Ethel.
All right.
Some more what?
You watch the baby, while we're gone, will you, Fred?
All right.
Some more what?
Some more one-dollar bills.
We're gonna take these ones and change them into fives at the market, and then we go to the drugstore change the fives into ones.
We've done it six times today.
How long will you be gone?
Until there isn't a dollar bill left in this neighborhood unturned.
Good-bye, dear.
So long, Fred.
Good-bye.
Adios.
We are married to a couple of birds.
Yep.
I think we'd better see that the door of their cage is locked.
Look, I got to go to work.
Excuse me while I put my tie on.
All right.
Find any new pearls?
Ah, who could tell, huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know, yeah.
I was gonna do the same thing, but I didn't have the paper with me.
: Oh, I see.
Let's check them.
All right.
Come on.
You can't tell.
Ah, that's nowhere No.
Nothing No.
"B-7 " "B-7-4 " Yeah.
Fred, wait a minute.
Huh?
I think I got one.
Oh, you're kidding.
I think I got one!
Well Check it for me, will you?
Yeah.
Check that!
Yeah.
"B, siete, ocho, quatro, cinco, cinco, seis, dos, nueve, G." Oh, read it in English, will you?
In English.
Wait a minute, what Look, I can't figure out what they are.
You read it to me, will you?
Hurry up.
Here, I'll read it.

We got it!
300 Bucks!
Oh, no!
And we were laughing at the girls!
Ha!
Lucy will die when she finds this out.
Ho, ho, ho!
It's too bad she couldn't find it herself.
Oh, yes.
Wait a minute!
Maybe she can.
What do you mean, "Maybe she can"?
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna take this dollar bill with me to the club, and when I come home tonight, she'll be asleep, see?
So, I'll sneak into the room and I'll put this in her purse, and tomorrow morning, I'll ask her to check her money again and let her find it.
Oh, what a great idea!
What a kick she'll get out of this!
She'll die!
Listen, don't say a word to anybody, huh?
No, no.
Don't even tell Ethel.
I won't breathe a word to Miss Walkie-Talkie.
Okay!
I'll see you later.
All right.
That's gonna be great!
Why, honey, what are you doing up so late?

Ours was the big one- 300 bucks!
So is that one.
It's ours!
Now, wait a minute.
The grocery boy gave that to me in change, so it's legally mine.

No, no.
You mean that's the bill you showed me last night?
Yeah, the big one!
You know the 300 bucks.
You saw me with it, didn't you, Fred?
Sure, I saw you with it.
You had it.
There!
Now, whose dollar is it?
It's Ethel's.
There, you see?
Ethel's?
How can you say that?

Because possession is nine points of the law.
Possession?
Mira que tiene cosa de decirle a uno que tengo Hey, he's right.
He's right.
Fred is right.
Well, I'm glad you finally saw the light.
I sure did.

The grocery boy gave it to me.
All right, all right, now, just a minute.
Just a minute.
We each have a very good case.
So, I tell you what let's do.
Let's split it.
We just did.
I mean the money.
Let's divide it.
No.
Oh Now, look, it says in the paper that somebody has to get down there before 3:00 with the buck, or nobody gets no money.
That's right.
That's right.
All right.
All right, Ethel, give me your half and I'll paste them together.
No, you give me your half.
Why, Ethel Mertz, don't you trust me?
No!
What an awful thing to say!
Well, you don't trust me.
That's different.
I know I can trust me.
Oh, look who knows she can trust All right, all right, now, just a minute.
I'll take charge of it.
Just give them to me.
Apparently, there's only one person here who everyone trusts.
Lucy?
Well!
Okay, I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll each keep our half and we'll go to the newspaper office together.
I'm for that.
Okay, I'll buy that.
I'm for that.
All right, Hey!

For safekeeping.
And I'll take charge of this for safekeeping.
Now I'll dress and take a shower and we'll all go down there together.

Well, now, wait a minute, it isn't my fault.
It's Ricky's fault.
Ricky's!
Ricky's!
Ricky's!
Sure.
How did I know there was anything in the pocket, and that was a pretty silly place to put it!
Yeah!
Yeah!
That was a pretty dumb stunt.
Yeah!
And if you weren't such a young man, I'd punch you in the nose!
Now just a minute, everybody.
It's nobody's fault, really.
It's just bad luck, that's all.
Now we just got to go down there and get it before they wash it.
Wash it?
Whoo.
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.
Oh.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Well, it's no use all of us going down to the laundry.

Yeah.
All right?
No matter what happens, get that bill.
All right, now, well, we-we might we might have to spend a few dollars getting it.
That's all right.
We'll pay it out of the winnings.

Now, please, just one of you tell me your story in just plain English.
You.
Well, you see, I-I found a bonus buck, and I brought it home last night.
I wanted to surprise my wife with it.
Y la senora se lo dio al grocer.
And then he took it downstairs, He gave it to the manager of the apartment who's Mrs. Mertz in the change and then when they come up she said she had found the bonus buck.
Actually, well, bonus buck que le puse en la cartera anoche.
And then we had a big fight and then we tore it up.
She had a half, and we had a half and then we decided together maybe we'd go down to the newspaper office and win the $300.
Y entonces yo fui a un shower y la puse en el top de la pajama se lo dio al muchacho del laundry and it's here, we got to get it back.
Look, you you picked a fine one to tell you in plain English.
Look, there's a little slip of paper that's worth $300.
It's in the pocket of my husband's pajamas and I sent it to the laundry.
Is that what you was trying to say?
Now never mind that.
I got to go in there and get it.

We couldn't take a chance.
Yeah.
And then we had to give $10 to the fellow down at the laundry for his overalls and his cap.
Yeah.
We had to sneak in the laundry, you know, to get her to give back.
Yeah, so?
And then we gave the taxicab driver an extra $25 to get us here in time.
Extra $25?
Yes.

{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
And now, Mrs. Weston, here's a picture of the new house our sponsor is giving you to take the place of your house that burned down.
You didn't expect that, did you?
Now, don't cry, Mrs. Weston.
There's nothing to cry about.
I have so much fun every day giving people things that they need.
We're giving you this new house for the one that burned down when it caught fire from the candles on the birthday cake of your little son, George.
And a whole new set of furniture.
Isn't that wonderful?
And a whole new wardrobe for the entire family.
And you have Mrs. Cleo Morgan to thank for this because she was such a good sport and a good neighbor.
Well, we'll see you tomorrow, folks, with another Good Neighbor program.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
This is such an entertaining program.
Oh, it looked like a million laughs.
No, it really is.
They do so many wonderful things for people.
I'm just mad about that program.
Look how much mail you got today.
Oh, thanks.
Gee, here's one for Ricky postmarked "Honolulu.
" Honolulu?
Yeah.
Didn't you know?
Why, Lucy, you know I never look at your mail.
Oh.
I wonder where it's from.
Mr. Jensen of the Royal Hawaiian.
Uh it says so on the back flap.
I wonder who he is.
Hey, the flap's open a little bit.
Maybe I can get it open some more.
Nope, it's stuck tight.
Can you see anything?
No, this envelope is so thick.
Boy, they make them thick.
Yeah.
Hey, wait a minute.
It looks exciting, doesn't it?
Look at all those things.
Too bad we couldn't get the flap open.
Yeah.
Well, maybe we could.
You never can tell Ah!
Cut it out, will you?
Eh, good morning, Ricky.
Oh!
Good morning.
Oh, hi, Ricky.
We were just trying to find out if this letter was really for you.
The name's kind of blurred.
Yeah, yeah, it's for you.
Yeah, Ricky Ricardo.
Yeah.
That's me.
Mm Oh Uh, I'm late for rehearsal.
I'll eat down at the club.
Good-bye.
But, Ricky Yeah?
What about the letter?
Oh, it wasn't important.
Wasn't important?
No, it's just business, honey.
Some millionaire, he wants me to take the band down to Hawaii with some entertainers and play a dance.
He says it wasn't important.
My goodness, that's exciting.
I've never been to Hawaii.
Neither have I. Oh, Ricky, we have to figure out some way so that we can take Fred and Ethel along with us, too.
"Too"?
Yeah, "too," as in "besides me.
" Aw, now, Ricky, you wouldn't go to Hawaii without me.
Honey, we're only going for one night.
We're coming right back.
I don't care.
A short trip is better than no trip at all.
Besides, you said you needed some entertainers.
We could be the entertainers.
What are you going to call yourselves- "The Deadweight Trio"?
Well, thanks a lot.
Now, wait a minute, Ethel, don't get mad.
This is no time to antagonize him.
Now, listen, give me just one good reason why we can't all go to Hawaii.
Because I can't afford it, honey.
I'm not making any money on this job.
I'm losing money.
I'm just taking it for the publicity value.
Now, good-bye.
Oh, Ricky Well, that's that.
Oh, no, it isn't.
I'm not giving up so easy.
Huh?
Oh, for once, I'm glad to see that gleam in your eye.
What do you have in mind?
Well, first, we've got to prove that we're good enough to take along.
Yeah?
But how?
How?
Yeah, now, let me see  Ricky, is that you?
Yeah.
Presenting a night in Hawaii!
King Kamehameha The conqueror of the islands Became a famous hero one day He bought a native army And he pushed it over the poly And crowned himself king of Hawaii-ee-aa And when the fray was over, he took the islands over And this is what he had to say Aa-ee-ooky-laa-ee-wahie Aa-waa-Hawaii-ee-aa And on his throne, he sat alone Waiting for a big luau The royal maidens stared Were gathered there To greet him with the grand halakay-ow-oh Oh, King Kamehameha The conqueror of the islands Became a famous hero one day He bought a native army And he pushed it over the poly And right, oh, up, ee-oo-ee-aa   Now, now, listen to me, girls.
Would-Would you listen a minute?
Just a minute.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Away, ay!
Away, ay!
Ay!
Ay!
Ay!
Hey!
You liked it?
Very good!
You liked it, huh?
Oh, I think you were wonderful!
He liked it!
He liked it!
Oh, you were just great!
Yeah.
Thank you.
Gee, it's too bad I can't take you with me.
But you said you liked it.
Yeah!
I did, honey.
I think you were just great.
Well, then, why can't we go?
Well, honey, if there's one thing that they don't need in Hawaii, it's Hawaiian dancers.
Ew Now, the troupe that I'm taking down there is made up of Latin American entertainers.
Ay, ay, ay, ay La cucaracha Just a minute!
Just a minute, everybody.
Now, I'm sorry, but Mr. Jensen already told me who he wants and I already hired them.
Oh, now, Ricky Now, Ricky, I don't see why you No, no, no, save your breath.
Save your breath.
Of course, this is only a hunch on my part, but I don't believe he wants to take us with him.
It's not that, Fred.
It's just that I can't.
Why not?
Well, honey, I can't afford it.
I'm losing money on the job.
I- I just can't do it.
There's nothing I can do about it.
And so, as the sun sinks slowly into the waters of the blue Pacific, we give up the only chance we had to go to Hawaii.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Ethel, I have just had the greatest idea of my career.
You know that show where they do all kinds of crazy stunts to help their needy friends?
You mean that show you were looking at the other day, the Freddie Fillmore show?
Be a Good Neighbor.
Listen to this: "Dear Freddie Fillmore, "I have been watching your show Be a Good Neighbor "for a long time, and I think it is wonderful what you do "for all the people who appear on your show.
"I want to tell you about a neighbor of mine.
"She is the sweetest, the dearest, "the most understanding person I ever knew, "and she is completely unselfish.
"She's always thinking of other people before herself.
Now, this person is terribly poor " Now, wait a minute.
You have to say something like that.
Uh, now "this person is terribly poor, "and she can't afford any luxuries for herself, "but it's always been the dream of her life "to go to the Hawaiian islands.
"So "I'm wondering if I couldn't appear "on Be a Good Neighbor "in order that this unselfish, generous, "sweet neighbor may realize her dream- "a trip to Honolulu.
Sincerely yours, Ethel Mertz.
" Why, you mean thing.
Now, just a minute Why, I was practically back in that Hawaiian costume.
What a fine friend you turned out to be.
Now, Ethel, the minute I won that trip, I was going to ask them to let me take Fred and Ethel Mertz with me.
Oh, sure.
I was, and if I couldn't take you with me, I was going to send you a postcard.
Oh, never mind.
Oh, now, Ethel, come on, what do you say?
This is what I say.
Ethel Mertz!
You just tore up my ticket to Honolulu.
Well, according to that letter, you're so sweet and thoughtful, it won't make any difference.
Oh, Ethel!
Well, that's one of the worst things you've ever done to me.
What do you mean, done to you?
There I was thinking all the time that maybe you What have I done to you?
Hey, what's going on here?
She's forging my name.
That's what's going on here.
What?
All I did was write that show Be a Good Neighbor and have Ethel ask them if I could go to Honolulu.
Well, now, that doesn't seem so bad, Ethel.
Oh, no?
Did you ever see that show?
Do you know what kind of stunts you have to do?
I'd get a pie in my face.
She'd get an all-expense cruise.
She'd be over there sitting on the beach and I'd be home combing meringue out of my hair.
So, you'd be a little uncomfortable for a while.
I'd do it for her.
Yeah, she'd do it for you.
Well, then let her.
Okay, I will.
Well, that's swell.
Watch out for a trick.
Please, Ethel, you hurt my feelings.
Yeah.
Ethel, I'm surprised at you.
Now, look, I'll write a letter to Freddie Fillmore and I'll tell him that there's a lovely couple who live across the hall from me who are very poor but they're so good and kind to everyone that I think he should give them a trip to Honolulu Aw Aw with their teenage daughter.
What?
!
Now what's wrong with that?
I told you to watch out for a trick.
I'm not going to Honolulu as Lucy's mother.
That's what's wrong with that.
Oh, listen, if it'll get us to Honolulu, I'll go as her mother.
Oh Oh, Ethel, if you're going to be silly how about me going as your mother?
Well, that's more like it.
All right.
I'll tell Freddie Fillmore that I know a lovely couple who are very poor but they've taken care of their dear, old gray-haired mother all their life.
Dear Freddie Fillmore Come on, Ethel.
I'm ready.
Come on.
Ethel, Fred!
What's the matter?
Where's Ethel?
Here I am.
What's the matter?
Freddie Fillmore just called me.
Honolulu!
Oh, we're in!
Honolulu!
Wait, wait, wait.
Before you start packing, I think there's something you ought to know.
What?
He's coming over to see me, but he wants to interview the poverty-stricken couple and their gray-haired mother.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Well, wait a minute now.
We've been in worse jams than this.
Yes, thanks to you.
Well, just give me time to think, will you?

However, if she isn't here so I can talk to you, I'm afraid I'll have to postpone it till some later time.
Oh?
Hark!
I think I hear her now.
I didn't hear anything.
Oh, I did.
Oh, so did I. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
Yeah, it's her.
Hey, Mrs. Ricardo, when you get your hat and coat off, could you come over for a minute?
Yeah, I'll be right over.
Oh, yeah, she said she'll be right over.
Well, good.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I got something on the stove.
She's old, but she's spry.
She's a nice old thing.
Yes, she is.
Whose mother is she?
Mine.
Mine.
Well, is she your mother, Ethel?
I thought she was mine.
She's been with us so long, I'd forgotten.
Oh, there she is.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo!
I want you to know this here's Freddie Fillmore.
How do you do, Mr. Fillmore?
How do you do?
It's so nice to know you.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, he told us all about that letter you wrote about us, and I want to thank you, good neighbor.
Well Thank you, good neighbor.
You're welcome, kindly couple.
Mother's out in the kitchen.
She'd like to thank you, too.
Oh, well, I'll go out and see mother right now.
Oh, no, no, you wait right here.
I'll go get her.
Well, that's funny.
She isn't out there.
Eh uh are you sure?
I looked all around.
Now where's Mrs. Ricardo?
Oh, uh oh, she had something on the stove, too.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah, we eat a lot around here.
Say, Mr. Fillmore, we sure do enjoy that show of yourn.
Yes, we do.
You know the one I especially liked?
What?
You know where that little feller came and said he wanted to get a puppy dog for his little friend Oh, yeah.
Burned up!
Had to throw it in the incinerator.
Burned to a crisp.
Oh, that's a shame.
Now, look, I'd like to have you all on the show tomorrow.
However, I must have you all in here at the same time so I can tell you what I want you to do.
Oh.
Well, I'll go get Mrs. Ricardo.
My, she is spry, isn't she?
Spry as a cricket.
Well, look, in the meantime, I have some papers here that I want you to sign.
Oh?
Oh, signing papers, huh?
Yeah, just a little legal formality that we have to go through with everyone who appears on our show.
Well, we don't mind doing that.
You want to see me, Mr. Fillmore?
Uh, ye Oh, yes, yes.
Now, uh Well, now where's mother?
Eh where's mother?
Well, she wasn't feeling well, so she's lying down in my apartment.
Oh.
Well, that's too bad.
Well, when she gets up, will you please have her sign this?
Yes.
And I want to see the rest of you down at the station the first thing tomorrow morning.
Oh, don't worry, we'll be there.
Please sign that.
" because they are so good and kind, "I think Mr. And Mrs. Mertz and their dear, old mother should have a trip to Honolulu.
" Signed "Hopefully yours, Lucy Ricardo.
" There.
Isn't that a nice letter?
We're so sorry that mother Mertz was too ill to come to the studio tonight.
Oh, well, she had a real bad spell, but she'll feel better.
She'll feel better soon.
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that.
Now, Mr. and Mrs. Mertz, I want you to go right over there and sit down in those two chairs on the opposite side of the stage, if you will.
All right.
Okay.
Right over there.
Sit right down in them.
Right there.
Now, lean back, relax.
Those are reclining chairs.
There, aren't you comfortable?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, fine.
Now, we're going to see if Mrs. Ricardo can win this trip to Honolulu for you.
And, Mrs. Ricardo, we have a real surprise for you.
Oh?
We have a friend of yours here today.
A friend of mine?
Yes.
You see, when we told him about Mr. and Mrs. Mertz and their dear old mother, he insisted on coming down here and helping you out.
Oh.
Wasn't that nice?
Send him out here, boys.
Ricky!
That's right- your husband, bandleader Ricky Ricardo.
Oh  Um are you sure he's going to help me?
Of course, dear.
Oh.
Oh, as a matter of face, he's going to do most of the work.
Now, here's what I want you to do.
Mrs. Ricardo, I want you to get right up there in that circle where you can get your hand on that cord.
And Mr. Ricardo, right up here, if you will.
Yes, sir.
There we are.
Now, what I want you to do is think of a song with something physical in it, like, uh Well, uh, rain.
I get the blues when it rains And the blues I can't lose I know the song.
You don't have to sing it.
You know it.
Oh, that's such a beautiful suit.
We wouldn't want anything to happen to that.
Boys, I think we'd better give him a slicker, huh?
Now, wait just a minute Oh, now, you're willing to do this for your neighbors, aren't you?
For the neighbors?
Well, sure you are.
Now, wait just a minute.
I don't know.
Oh, of course you will.
There we are.
All right.
Now I think we're all set.
Mrs. Ricardo, every time he says the word "rain " Yeah?
you pull that cord.
Oh, okay.
You got the idea?
Yeah, I got it.
All set.
Mrs. Ricardo, you know what to do.
I sure do.
Okay!
All right, go ahead and sing.
I get the blues when it rains Yeah, boy!
All of the Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What's he got the slicker on for?
Well, I was afraid some of that rain might splash and get on him.
Well, thanks a lot.
Oh, and there's one other thing I forgot to tell you, Mrs. Ricardo.
If you step outside of that circle at any time during the stunt your friends don't get the trip to Honolulu.
Well, isn't it over?
Over?
We haven't even started yet.
Well, what was all that rain stuff?
Oh, that's just a little test.
Oh.
Oh, uh, Ricky, here's what I want you to do.
I have a list of words here- things, oh, like leaves, feathers, stuff like that.
Now, I want you to see how many songs you can think of that contain those words, and every time you sing one of those songs, you push your friends just a little closer to Honolulu.
And if within the two-minute time limit, you can think of enough songs and Mrs. Ricardo doesn't step outside of that circle, then the Mertzes get the trip to Honolulu, you understand?
Yeah, I got it.
Okay, now you've got exactly two minutes.
Okay.
Go!
All right.
Um I'm putting all my eggs In one basket They're in Detroit.
Uh How deep is the ocean Chicago.
I'm in love with you Oh, no, not that!
Not that!
Honey Oh, no!
Denver!
Say you love me No, not again!
Not again!
Honey Oh, no  West Denver!
Just around the corner There's a rainbow in the sky So let's have another cup of coffee  San Francisco, and you have five seconds to go!
Hurry up!
Five seconds, huh?
Let's have another piece of Um um Come on!
Come on, come on!
Sorry.
Time's up.
You've lost.
Pie, you idiot!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Here.
Thanks.
Oh, the opera opened last night.
Will you look at that.
The lobby looks like a field of waving mink.
Gee, and all the parties they went to afterward- Gosh, I bet they had a good time.
Lucy Huh?
Why do you envy those people?
I don't envy them.
I just wish I could dress like them and live the way they do, that's all.
Honey, the only way to be real happy is to be satisfied with what you got.
Oh?
What have I got?
Me.
My cup runneth over.
Well!
Thank you.
Oh, no.
What happened?
"Cynthia Harcourt just got back from Europe and is in town on a charity drive.
" So?
What's that to you?
Oh, I went to school with her.
Oh.
She had nothing but money, and she married money.
Seemed like such a waste to me.
Money always marries money.
Yeah.
Why doesn't money ever marry broke?
Who knows?
Well, if she's on a charity drive, I just won't answer the phone for a few days.
She always calls up all the girls she went to school with and asks for contributions, you know.
So let her call.
She knows you're not wealthy.
Well, I don't know.
Cynthia, somehow, has gotten the impression that you lead a band just for a hobby.
And where, pray say, did she get this impression?
From the same person that told her that you really own a big sugar plantation in Cuba.
Who is that?
Someone we all know and love who ought to keep her big mouth shut.
Now you see what I mean?
You were envious of somebody.
You tried to be something that you weren't and now you're in trouble.
You're right, Ricky.
I'm never gonna be envious of anyone again.
Good.
What if I'm not sitting in the lap of luxury?
I'm happy where I am- on the bony knees of nothing.
I like bony knees.
Hello.
Lucy, darling, this is Cynthia, Cynthia Harcourt.
Cynthia, dear.
Oh, darling, it's so nice to speak to you again.
I can't believe I'm here.
You know, only last night I was in Paris.
Oh?
Oh, Paris!
Give me Paris in the springtime.
Isn't that the way you feel, dear?
Oh, oui, oui.
Oh!
Vous parlez francais?
Huh?
Parlez-vous francais?
How's that again?
Do you speak French?
Oh, yes.
Fluently.
Oh, Lucy, you're so droll.
Well, tell me, dear.
You know, we're staying in a hotel now, but Cyrus is thinking of moving to New York and I was wondering- how's the servant problem?
The servant problem?
Yes.
Oh, frightful, darling.
I just don't know what to do about it.
Well, do you think that I could get by with a staff of ten?
Oh, yes, I think you can get by with a staff of ten.
Well, how many do you have?
Me?
Oh, I have, uh Well, do you have more than ten?
Well, uh frankly, Cynthia.
I think that you should know we live a very simple life.
We have a tiny little place.
We're just normal, average people.
Oh.
I'm going over to see Fred.
Okay, dear.
Well, how many do you have?
Eight.
Oh.
My, you must have a tiny place.
Well, uh, dear, this nasty, old money business- you know I really hate it, but I'm chairman of the charity drive this year, and I was wondering how much I could count on you for?
Well, Cynthia, I've given to so many charitable things this year I've practically nothing left.
Oh, Lucy, darling, I'd hate to print your name in the book and put a zero after it.
Yes.
I'm sure you would, dear.
Well, surely you can scrape a few dollars together, like your classmates did.
Anita gave seven, Adelle gave six and Hazel gave eight.
Oh, I had no idea that such a sniggly little bit would count.
Oh, certainly, darling, everything counts.
Oh, well, put me down for five.
Wonderful!
Should I pop over and pick it up?
Uh, no.
No.
I'm going shopping today.
I'd be glad to drop it by.
Oh, fine.
Wonderful.
I'll see you then, dear.
All right.
Where are you staying, Cynthia?
Cynthia?
Oh, darn it.
What's the matter?
Oh that was an old schoolmate of mine, Cynthia Harcourt, and she's here on a charit The Cynthia Harcourt?
Yeah.
Did you go to school with her?
Yeah, and she's in town on a charity drive.
I promised to drop a check but I don't know where she's staying.
Well, it told all about it in the society column this morning.
I was reading it.
That's right.
I forgot.
Yeah.
She has a penthouse at the Waldorf.
Oh, gee.
I've always wanted to see what a penthouse looked like.
Want to go with me?
Can I?
Sure.
Oh, boy, yes.
Imagine me in high society.
Hi.
: Oh, Frederic, darling, If you're looking for me this afternoon, I shan't be home.
I'll be at the penthouse at the Waldorf.
Well, she finally flipped.
She did not.
She's going with me to see an old schoolmate who put the bite on me for a charity drive.
Lucy?
Yeah?
How much did she bit you for?
Five measly dollars.
I'm taking her a check.
Why don't you mail it to her?
Oh, because I want to see her penthouse.
I bet it's just fabulous.
There you go again- wanting something that you haven't got.
I do not.
I just want to see what it is I haven't got that I don't want.
Okay, old man, we're going to go for a nice walk.
It's a beautiful day.
Say good-bye to Mommy.
Bye-bye, darling.
Give me a kiss.
You be a good boy, now.
Now, honey, remember- no hot dogs no peanuts, no popcorn.
All right, how about a glass of beer?
Oh!
Come on, now, you keep him bundled up, too.
I think it might rain today, dear.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, now, be careful with him.
I will.
Oh, hi, honey.
You going out?
Yeah.
He's going for a walk.
Come on, Fred, you want to walk with us, man?
Okay.
Come on, champ.
Come on, we'll take you.
Now, honey, keep him bundled up.
All right, Mother, all right.
Good-bye.
Bye-bye, darling.
Come on.
Are you ready?
Yeah, just about.
I got the check all made out here.
I got to take one last look and see if I'm all right.
I put this flower on my hat.
Do you think it's okay?
Oh, I think you look great.
All right.
You didn't say anything about how I look.
Lucy, darling!
Oh!
Cynthia!
Oh, Cynthia, uh Uh, Ethel, this is Cynthia Harcourt.
This is Ethel Mertz.
Oh.
Charmed.
Ooh, likewise.
Well, you know, darling, I realized after I spoke with you on the phone that I hadn't told you where we were staying.
So I thought I'd just pop over myself.
Oh, well, I'm awfully glad you did, Cynthia.
You'll have to forgive the way the place looks.
I well, I-I just flew into a nasty rage this morning and fired all the servants.
Didn't I, Ethel.
All of 'em.
You know, dear, I've been thinking.
Really, maybe I shouldn't have phoned you to ask you for money.
I mean, you know with the tiny, little place you have here and being a bandleader's wife and all, maybe you can't afford it.
Oh, nonsense, Cynthia.
This dump is just a place for Ricky to hang his clothes.
We spend most of our time in the country.
Oh, this is your town house?
Well, it's really our town closet.
Yes.
We have a beautiful summer place- a big mansion, stables, and swimming pool.
And tennis courts.
Oh, delightful sounds like our summer place.
Where's yours?
Um where's yours?
Bucks County.
Oh, ours is in Westchester.
Oh, wonderful.
We must come and visit you soon.
Oh, well, that would be lovely, Cynthia, except that we don't expect to spend much time there this season.
You're going to Florida.
Why not?
Well, so are we.
Oh.
Where do you go in Florida?
Miami or West Palm Beach?
Uh, you go West Palm Beach, huh?
Miami.
Oh, we go West Palm Beach.
But, darling, the harbor's so small there.
What do you do with your yacht?
To make it fit, we crank down the smokestack and squeeze in the poop deck.
Oh, Lucy, you are droll.
Oh, droll is the word.
Well, really, I hate to be crass but I suppose we should get down to business.
Oh, yes.
Do sit down, Cynthia.
Thank you.
Now, I'll get out my little book here.
Now, let me see.
Yes "Lucille McGillicuddy Ricardo.
" Now, you said on the phone you were going to give five.
Is that right?
That's right.
You can put me down for five, too.
Oh, marvelous, Mrs. Hertz.
Thank you.
It's Mertz.
You spell it with an "M".
Oh?
Oh, thank you.
"Mrs. Mertz- five hundred "  Uh Oh, uh Cynthia W- W-We didn't really mean 500.
Five thousand?
Oh, no.
Well, you you certainly couldn't have meant five dollars.
Oh, no.
Well, what did you mean?
I I guess we meant 500.
Well, are you going to give me your check now, dear?
Oh, uh, no.
No.
I'll have to send you the check.
My business manager makes out all my checks.
Oh, fine.
Well, I'm at the Waldorf.
Yes.
Your check, Mrs. Mertz?
Oh, her business manager makes out all my checks, too.
Oh?
I just love his handwriting.
Oh, well very well.
I'll hear from you then.
Oh, yes, Cynthia.
Yes.
I'm so glad that you came by, dear.
It's wonderful seeing you again.
Good-bye.
$500 each!
Hi.
How'd you do?
All I could find was 76 cents in one of Fred's old coats.
What are you doing?
I'm checking the local branch of the first national couch.
You find anything?
and an old piece of Christmas candy.
Not much of a start toward $1,000, is it?
No.
I even opened the baby's piggy bank.
What'd you find?
Three IOUs from Ricky.
Oh, fine.
Well, we better just send her our checks for five dollars and forget about it.
Forget about it?
Do you want your name in that little book with "five dollars" printed after it?
Why not?
For me that's good.
Well, for me it isn't.
All the girls I went to school with will see that book and I told them all that Ricky's loaded.
I just got to get my hands on $500.
Hey- would you be willing to work for it?
Sure.
Well, Billboard always has a lot of ads in it wanting people for different things.
Let's see if there's anything in here we could do.
Here.
Hey, there's something you could do.
Oh, no, you don't.
Not even for sweet charity am I going to box three rounds with a kangaroo.
Let me take that.
"Need two girls with courage "for publicity stunt.
High pay for right parties.
" Ah, no.
What's the matter, haven't you got courage?
Yeah, I got courage, but it says they need girls.
Well, we're girls.
We are?
If you divide everybody into boys and girls, we're girls.
I never thought about it like that.
I'm going to call up and find out about this ad.
Okay.
This might be something we could do.
Courage for what, I wonder.
Hello?
Hello.
I'm calling about your ad in Billboard- "two girls with courage.
" Yes, sir.
Oh, yes.
Yes, we can keep a secret.
Oh, plenty of courage.
Yes, sir.
All right.
All right, sir.
Well?
He's coming right over.
Hello.
Hi.
Al Sparks is the name.
Oh.
Well, where are the girls?
We're the girls.
Oh.
Yes, this is Ethel Mertz.
I'm Lucy Ricardo.
How do you do.
Won't you sit down?
Yeah Yeah, I, uh I guess you'll do.
I guess it doesn't make any difference as long as you're coming from Mars.
Mars?
!
Yeah.
So long, Lucy.
Ethel.
Did you say "coming from Mars"?
Yeah, that's right.
You see, tomorrow night, my studio is having a premiere of a new picture- Women From Mars.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Well, tomorrow afternoon, two Martian women are going to land in New York, abduct an earthman, and disappear.
Now, that's where you come in.
That's where I go out.
Ethel, now sit down.
Now, don't worry.
I got every angle figured.
Well, tell it to her.
Ethel, honey, you've got to do this with me.
No.
Think of my reputation.
No.
There's 500 bucks in it for each of you.
Okay.
What do we do?
Now, here's the way I got it figured.
The first thing we do is sneak up to the top of the Empire State Building.
The top of the Empire State Building?
!
Well, Martha, we finally made it.
Oh, yes, Henry- the top of the Empire State Building.
You know, Martha, this is the tallest building in the world.
Henry, give me a dime.
All right.
Just a minute.
There you are, dear.
Oh, I can't find it.
Well, what are you looking for, Martha?
Wichita.
Oh, Martha.
Anybody knows Wichita is over that way.
Oh.
Now point it up.
See anything?
No.
A little higher.
Look.
See?
Seen any flying saucers yet?
Flying saucers?
You don't mean there really are such things?
Well, I don't know.
There've been a lot of rumors lately.
People think spaceships are coming down from Mars and landing on Earth.
Oh, nonsense.
What's the matter?
Thought I saw something flash by just now.
It was probably nothing.
Look through there.
See if you can see anything.
Little lower.
Little lower.
That may not be smoke.
Look right through there, look.
I don't see anything either.
Well, I think I saw one.
Look right through here, Martha.
Right out through here.
Little higher.
No, it's a little lower, a little lower than that.
I can't see a thing.
You can't?
I don't think there's anything up there, really I don't.
Certainly looked like I saw something.
What are they?
Th-th-they look like women from Mars.
Now, now, let's not get hysterical.
Maybe we can talk to them.
Pardon me.
Are are you from Mars?
Just a minute.
Anybody ready to go down?
Me?
Watch out!
That's a paralyzing ray.
Hey, Rick, where are the girls?
I don't know.
When I got home, Mrs. Trumbull was with the baby.
What's the matter?
We're being invaded from outer space.
What?
It's on every radio and television.
A flying saucer landed on the Empire State Building.
earthman.
I think you've been working too hard.
Come on, come on.
Let's go up on the roof and protect our home and loved ones.
I'll go get Little Ricky.
He's never seen a flying saucer before.
And bring your binoculars.
Bring the binoculars.
Now, come on.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
Right away.
: Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.
Hey, Little Ricky, you want to go and see some flying saucers?
All right, girls I'm going to get right out of here.
Here you are, here's your money.
$500 apiece.
Thank you very much.
Okay, I haven't got time to wait for you to change, so I'll pick the uniforms up later.
Okay.
You were great.
Bye.
Bye.
Sechs, sieben, acht, neun.
How are things on Mars?
Very wealthy.
Change?
Change.
"New York invaded by Martian women.
"Hordes of invaders also seen in New Jersey and Connecticut.
" One man in Connecticut saw 20 of us.
Oh, look at those headlines.
Lucy?
What?
You don't suppose this is all a horrible coincidence, do you?
What do you mean?
Well, all that Martian talk- people thinking they've seen Martians.
You don't suppose some real Martians decided to come down on Earth at the same time we pulled this stunt, do you?
Oh, that's silly isn't it?
I don't know.
I just wish Fred was home.
Gee, I wish Ricky was home, too.
Oh, why did you have to say all that?
Now I got a spooky feeling about everything.
Well, all those Oh, dear.
What's that?
What's that?
I don't know.
That's a horrible noise.
Call the police.
Get the police.
We can't call the police.
Oh, no.
We'd have to tell them the whole story.
We can't tell anyone about this.
" and so, it's been firmly established "that most of the reports "were the result of mass hysteria.
"The only Martians anyone saw "were two on top of the Empire State Building, "and it is suspected "that they might have had something to do "with the opening tomorrow of a motion picture "entitled Women From Mars.
"So everybody relax.
There has been no invasion by Martians.
"  Mm-hmm.
Well, I don't know.
Well, why do you say that, honey?
Well, I've just got a funny feeling.
Listen, by the way, you haven't said much about this.
Where were you when all this excitement happened?
Oh, we-we-we were out shopping and we didn't hear anything about it until we got home, did we, Ethel?
No, no, we didn't hear anything about it.
Oh.
Well, dinner's ready.
Yes, sir.
It looks good Fine.
Looks good.
I hope that meat is cooked the way you like it, Fred.
It looks delicious, Lucy.
Looks delicious.
I kind of like to do things the way you like them, you know.
You're a good cook.
You're the champion hostess.
The part of Cynthia Harcourt was played by Mary Jane Croft.
Al Sparks was Herb Vigren.
The couple on the roof were Dick Elliot and Kaye Wiley.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Hi.
What are you doing?
Writing a novel.
Oh.
I brought back the magazine I A novel?
!
Yeah.
I found this in the paper this morning.
"Housewife wins $10,000 prize for first novel.
" Need I say more?
Yes.
Well, I'm a housewife.
Oh, well, I think it takes a little more than that to write a novel.
What are you going to write about?
I'm writing about things I know.
That won't be a novel, that'll be a short story.
One more remark like that and I'll kill you off in chapter one.
Oh, am I going to be in it?
Sure.
We all are- you, Ricky, Fred, me- not under our own names, of course.
Now then  What are you doing?
I'm studying you.
Huh?
Ethel, what makes you tick?
Tick?
What makes you you?
Me me?
Yeah.
Lucy, I don't think I'm going to like this.
Ethel, you don't seem to realize what this means.
My novel may turn out to be another Gone With The Wind.
If it does, that makes you Scarlett O'Hara.
Me?
!
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, if you want to know what I'm really like, I'm deeper than most people think.
On the surface, I'm carefree and happy, but deep down inside, I'm intense and moody.
I'm sensitive.
I feel things.
What's the matter, Ethel?
You got a stomachache?
Well, if it isn't Rhett Butler.
Why don't you find out what makes him tick?
He creaks a little, too.
What's going on in this booby hatch?
"Booby hatch"!
That's good.
I'll use it.
Ethel, what is all this?
Lucy's writing a novel, and we're all gonna be in it!
You mean she's writing a novel this very minute?
Yeah.
No kidding?
Yeah.
Well, well What's going on?
Lucy's writing a novel.
Oh.
What?
!
She's writing a novel, and we're all in it.
Are you kidding?
You're really writing a novel?
Yes, and I'm glad you're up.
There are a few questions I'd like to put to you.
All right put.
What was your reaction when you came to this country for the first time?
"A lonely immigrant arriving in New York Harbor on a cattle boat.
" You crazy or something?
You know darn well I came here by plane- from Havana to Miami Beach- and I wasn't lonely; I had 14 musicians with me.
Not in my book, you didn't.
"As your leaky Cuban cattle boat steamed into New York Harbor, "tears cascaded down your cheeks "as you saw the Statue of Liberty for the first time.
"You clutched your knapsack to you- "your pitiful little bundle "that contained all your worldly belongings- "and you wept unashamedly.
"You made a vow "that someday you would be a famous orchestra leader.
"You promised yourself Wait a minute.
Wait, wait!
"that never Wait, wait!
Wait, wait!
never would you " Wait, wait, wait.
Is this the kind of stuff you're writing about?
Yeah.
Pretty good, huh?
But, honey, it isn't true.
Ricky, that's what writers do.
They take the truth and twist it a little.
Well, if your book doesn't sell, you can always get a job making pretzels.
I think we'd better take a look at what she's writing about.
Yeah, I want to see how she's twisting me.
Yeah.
Just a moment.
A writer's work is sacred.
You can read it when it becomes a best seller.
And now, if you'll excuse me, the muse calls, and I must answer.
Yep, it's not here.
Well, I can't find it.
It's not in here.
Well, we looked all over this place and the other room.
Let's go and look in the kitchen.
All right.
Okay.
It's got to be here someplace.
Fred, if you were Lucy's novel, where would you go?
Oh, I'd run down in the basement and jump in the furnace.
Aah, come on, this is silly.
It's got to be here someplace.
Look under the sink, will you?
Oh, okay.
I'll give you some light.
Yeah, that'll help.
I got it!
What?
What?
She had it in the blind!
She had it up there in the blind!
Oh, my heavens.
Oh, God, come on In the blind.
Oh, boy.
How cute can you be?
Now we'll get this all straightened out here.
Listen to this.
I got the title.
Real Gone With The Wind.
Real gone.
Don't you love that.
Here's the first page.
"Now it can be told for the first time "how I, Lucille Mcgillicuddy, "gave up a brilliant career in the theater "to marry a poor and unknown bongo player "This, then, will be the story "of one of the brightest lights in show business and how she dimmed her bulb.
" Oh, brother!
"Dimmed her bulb"!
Wait a minute.
Wait, I got something here.
Listen to this.
"Later, we moved to an apartment on East 68th Street.
"It was there that I met Ethel Nurtz, our landlady.
Ethel Nurtz?
That must be misspelled.
No, she said she wasn't gonna use our real names.
Well, nobody'd know who Ethel Nurtz is.
Oh, no.
No.
Let me go on here.
Get the rest of it.
"It was there I met our landlady, Ethel Nurtz.
"We became the very best of friends "in spite of the great difference in our ages.
"As the years went along, "I came to think of her not just as a friend, not just as a neighbor, but as a mother.
" A mother?
!
It says so!
I don't think that's so funny.
Oh, no, I think it's kind of good.
Go ahead and laugh.
Well, ha-ha-ha, listen to this.
"A colorful character in our neighborhood was a funny old coot named Fred Nurtz.
" Shall I go on?
No.
Go on.
"He was really a nice person if you had the time and energy "to look beneath his rough and grumpy exterior.
"The best thing about Fred was that when you met him, you understood why Ethel was like she was.
" What does that mean?
I don't know, but I'll bet it's insulting.
Yeah.
Now, come on, don't be such bad sports.
You're being too sensitive.
Oh, we're being sensitive.
Sure.
Wait till you get to the part Go on, find something about yourself.
Yeah, let's get a page We'll see how sensitive you are.
Okay.
"Mother," "difference in our ages.
" Whoo.
Here's something.
Here's something right here.
"The greatest day of my life "was the day I was married to Nicky Nicardo.
Nick Nicky Nicardo?
I wonder who she means.
Oh, I wouldn't know.
"Although Nicky was an unknown when I married him "  " he soon became one of the country's leading Latin-American entertainers.
" That doesn't make me mad.
No, no.
Shouldn't.
"His voice charmed millions.
His guitar-playing made women swoon.
" You know, she writes very well.
"His voice charmed millions.
"His guitar-playing made women swoon.
So it was a small wonder that " Where's page 12?
Page 12.
Let's find it.
I got it.
I got it.
Good.
What did that say?
"His voice charmed millions.
"His guitar-playing made women swoon.
"So it was a small wonder that " he turned into such a big ham, you could stuff him with clove.
"  Now, that is not funny.
It's not funny at all.
No, sir.
I think we'd better read this novel from beginning to end right now.
I want the whole thing, the whole thing.
I want to read the whole thing.
Makes a nice fire, doesn't it?
Uh-huh.
Well, hi, everybody.
Hi.
Hello.
Hello.
How come you got a fire on a nice day like this?
Well, it makes it so comfy-like.
There's nothing like a good book and a roaring fire.
You mean a good book in a roaring fire.
That's more like it.
Yeah.
What are you three up to?
We pulled down the kitchen blind and changed the name of your novel to Forever Ember.
You didn't.
Well, the three little snoopers.
I trust you didn't have too much trouble finding it.
Well, it wasn't easy.
First of all, we had to make ourselves think the way you do.
That was an accomplishment in itself.
You know, the way that you wrote about the Mertzes and me is really something.
"A great difference in our ages.
" Huh!
"Funny old coot.
" "I'm such a ham, I should go lie down between two pieces of rye bread.
" My book isn't even published yet and already I'm being misquoted.
Thanks to us, your book will never be published.
But don't worry, it went out in a blaze of glory.
Yep, you wrote a red-hot novel.
: That's where I got "A blaze of glory.
" "A red-hot novel.
" "A blaze of glory.
" That's You're all very smug, aren't you?
If I'd known the type of people that I was dealing with, I'd have made a carbon copy.
Yes, that would have been very clever.
Yes.
Mm.
As a matter of fact, I do know the type of people that I'm dealing with.
Pardon me.
Pardon me, please.
Pardon.
Pardon me, please.
Pardon.
Pardon me.
Pardon, please.
Let's see.
I think that's all.
One, two, three- yes.
Not counting the one that I sent to Dorrance & Company Publishers.
See you around the bookstores.
Oh, darn it!
Don't tell me you've been down there looking for that mailman again.
Yes, I have.
You'd think he'd be early just this once when he knows that I'm waiting for a letter from my publisher.
Lucy, you really don't think anyone's gonna publish that book of yours, do you?
You don't, do you?
If I had the slightest idea that anyone would ever consider it, I'd be down at the publisher's with my lawyer right now.
You wait.
You'll eat those words.
If anybody ever publishes that book, I'll eat my hat.
Oh Registered letter.
Dorrance & Dorrance Publishers!
Will you sign here, please?
Please.
Yeah.
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's here!
It's here!
This is it.
I got it.
They din't.
Oh, "din't" they?
They're gonna publish my book and they sent me a hundred- dollar advance royalty!
Be my guest.
Darlings, wait till you hear!
I had the most wonderful idea for a sequel to my first novel.
It's all about a little boy who runs away from a plantation in Cuba.
I'm calling it Sugarcane Mutiny.
Sweet.
Lucy?
Yes, sir.
We have something to say to you.
Yes, darling?
Fred and Ethel and I just had a conference.
Oh.
Nothing personal, dear, but we're suing you for libel.
You're suing me?
!
For every cent I've got.
Well, I can't believe it.
You're suing me- your wife, your best friend?
Yup.
We three are suing little old loveable, libelous Lucy.
Well, if that's the way you feel about it.
Too bad, though, considering I was going to split the royalties four ways.
Split the royalties?
!
Yes, yes.
I was saving that as sort of a surprise.
Lucy, you know darn well that that never occurred to you until you found out that we were going to sue.
Well, that was a surprise.
I still say sue her.
Sue her!
Oh, sewer, sewer!
Get your mind out of the gutter!
I don't want my name in that book.
Ethel, just think of the money.
Why, your share alone might be $50,000.
Yeah, what's the matter with you, Ethel?
It sounds all right to me.
Why, Fred, where's your pride?
Remember, she called you an old coot.
Listen, she can call me anything she likes for $50,000 Honestly!
I'm in for a fourth, Lucy.
Well, this friend, neighbor and mother is not.
Neither is the Cuban ham.
Well!
Yes?
Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes, sir?
I'm Mr. Dorrance of Dorrance & Company.
Oh!
How do you do, Mr. Dorrance?
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
Oh, this is Mr. Dorrance, my publisher.
How do you do?
Mr. and Mrs. Mertz.
How are you?
And this is my husband, Mr. Ricardo.
How do you do?
Mr. Dorrance, my publisher.
Won't you sit down, sir?
Thank you.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, Mr. Dorrance, this is such a surprise.
I'm so pleased to meet you.
It certainly is a wonderful thrill to have my book published for the first time.
Well, Mrs. Ricardo, ordinarily, I don't handle these things myself.
But in your case, I thought I ought to come out and talk to you myself.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Mrs. Ricardo, last week my secretary got married.
Oh.
Well, congratulations.
Thank you.
Anyway, for the last few days, she hasn't had her mind on her work, and somehow, she got your name on someone else's manuscript.
You mean she made a mistake?
That's right.
And when I wrote to you, asking to publish your novel, I was referring to someone else's work entirely.
Oh.
I was just sick when I found out about it, so I sat down and read your novel.
I know how disheartening this is to someone who is just starting to write, and I can't tell you how sorry I am that it happened.
Oh, well, then this means you won't be publishing?
I'm sorry, but it isn't quite what we're looking for right now.
Oh.
Well, I-I guess you want your check back, then.
No, please.
We'd like you to keep it for all of the heartaches we've given you.
Oh, no.
No, I couldn't accept it.
I wish you would.
Oh, no.
I couldn't.
Well, I could accept $25 of it.
Well, good-bye.
Uh thank you for coming over, Mr. Dorrance.
I'm awfully sorry.
It's all right.
Good-bye.
Thank you.
Oh, honey, don't feel so bad.
What does he know?
Oh, sure.
You wrote a wonderful novel full of true-to-life characters.
Yeah.
Yeah, come to think of it, I really am a funny old coot.
Sure he is.
Sure.
Sure.
Come on, honey, cry or something.
Don't just stand there looking like that.
I can't take it.
I can't cry.
This is deeper than tears.
Oh, now, wait till you write your second novel.
Why, Mr. Dorrance will come crawling to buy it.
Yeah!
Sure, yeah, sure.
There'll be no second novel.
My voice has been stilled.
Aw, honey, don't cry.
Well, make up your mind.
You want me to cry or don't you?
I mean, it's nothing to get so upset and sad about.
I'm not sad for myself.
I'm sad for the world.
Mankind will never benefit from these immortal pages.
It isn't my loss, it's a loss to civilization.
Too bad, world.
Too bad, mankind.
Sorry, book of the month.
You had your chance, Bennett Cerf!
You'll get no more books from me, so go watch television!
Ricky, will you write a note to the milkman for me?
Sure.
Why don't you do it?
Please, I'm not writing anything again as long as I live.
What do you want me to say?
Two quarts of milk and a pint of cream.
Okay.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Mr. Dorrance.
You did?
You do?
Oh, yes, sir.
First thing in the morning.
Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.
Plaza 5-2-0-9-9.
Oh, yes.
Yes, sir, I will.
First thing in the morning.
Oh, and thank you, sir.
Good-bye.
Ricky, that was Mr. Dorrance, my publisher, and he talked to a friend of his who's a publisher and he told this friend about my book and he wants to see it.
He thinks he can use it.
Oh, honey, that's wonderful.
Isn't it great?
Wait a minute.
You tor What's the matter?
You tore up every copy you had.
Oh, well, we'll have to glue one back together again.
Where is it?
I just took the trash down to the basement.
Oh, Ricky, no!
I didn't know that Hey, you want to go to What time does Fred burn the trash?
Uh, uh, he's burning it right now.
No!
No, Fred!
What's the matter?
Fred, hold everything!
Fred!
Hold everything!
Fred, hold everything!
What's the matter?
Have you burned the trash yet?
I just started.
Which one did you put it in, Ricky?
I- I put it in one of these.
Well, which one?
!
I don't know.
They all look the same to me.
Don't just stand there, start looking!
Okay.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, will you?
What the Sam Hill's going on here?
Another publisher wants to publish Lucy's novel, and it's all in the trash, all torn-up pieces.
Oh, this is the silliest thing I ever heard of.
Pawing through trash from all the apartments trying to find two or three bits of paper!
Well, don't just stand there, start looking!
Come on!
Want to try that there, huh?
No, that's not it.
No.
Oh, that fits there.
This goes right there.
Another one from here?
These must go over on the other side.
Take a look over there, will you?
Let's try it.
"Poor thing.
" Well, that's 32.
I'm ready for 33.
I've got it here- everything but one little piece.
Ethel.
Huh?
See if you can find one that fits this, will you?
What's it supposed to say?
Oh, right here.
I got So far, I got "I thought about it at night "before going to bed, as I sat there, brushing my " What follows, Lucy?
Naturally red hair.
"Naturally red hair"?
Why, I threw that away.
I didn't think that came from Lucy's book.
Oh, come on, get it out of there and bring it over here.
I'll try and find it.
I think I can find it.
Here it is!
He's got it.
Oh, good.
Ricky, don't sneeze!
Oh, no!
Oh, no, Ricky.
Ricky, don't sneeze!
Don't sneeze!
No, no!
Honey, don't sneeze.
Whatever you do, don't sneeze.
Okay.
Oh, hang on.
Take it easy, kid.
Hang on.
Take it easy.
Ah, that's my boy.
I knew you could do it.
Okay, I got that page for you, honey.
You're the wonderful Look out, honey!
Oh, honey!
Lucy!
I'm sorry, Mr. Eaton, but a $10,000 advance will not be sufficient.
Huh?
Oh, Mr. Eaton.
Why do you have on your pajamas?
Honey, it's me, Ricky.
Wake up.
Oh.
Oh.
Haven't you gone to bed yet?
No.
I have to retype this so it'll be neat.
Honey, it's 9:30 in the morning!
You said you were coming right to bed.
Come on, honey.
You got to get some rest.
Come on, sweetheart, honey.
What's the matter?
She's supposed to see Mr. Eaton early this morning.
Well, she wanted to Yeah, I got to call Mr. Eaton.
I have to call Mr. Eaton right now.
What happened to her?
Well, she wanted to retype the novel so it'd look neat, and she sat up all night and typed the whole thing over again.
Oh, no.
She hasn't gone to bed yet.
Hello.
Oh, may I speak to Mr. Eaton, please?
This is Mr. Eaton speaking.
Oh, Mr. Eaton, This is Mrs. Ricardo.
I was supposed to bring a novel down to you this morning.
Can I still come down?
Is it too late?
Why, of course, Mrs. Ricardo.
Come down any time you like.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Oh, uh, Mrs. Ricardo Yes, sir?
Did Mr. Dorrance tell you how I wanted to use it?
How's that?
Mr. Dorrance, did he tell you how I wanted to use it?
No, sir.
Well, I'd like very much to print portions of it in a textbook I'm preparing on how to write a novel.
Oh!
Oh, he wants to print portions of it in a textbook on how to write a novel.
Go on, Mr. Eaton.
Well, I-I wish Mr. Dorrance had mentioned this to you, but, uh it'll head up the chapter entitled "Don't let this happen to you.
" Uh, it's going to head up the chapter entitled "Don't let this happen to you.
"
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Girls girls  Girls, come on.
Girls, let's get on with the meeting.
But, Madam President, Marion hasn't finished her story about Jim and Dorothy Winn.
It is not our concern if Jim and Dorothy Winn had a knock-down, drag-out fight.
This is the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League.
We do not meet to gossip.
Since when?
Girls, girls.
Oh, yes.
Is there any unfinished business?
The chair recognizes Lucy Ricardo.
Marion, did Jim really give Dorothy a black eye?
Oh, Lucy.
Lucy.
Well, that was unfinished business.
Oh, sit down.
Well, if there's no more unfinished business, I have an important announcement to make.
We only have $1.14 in the treasury, so I hereby declare the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League in a state of emergency.
You can say that again.
We have to get some money in the treasury and we have to get it there fast.
The chair entertains ideas on just how to do this.
The chair recognizes Caroline Appleby.
Well, there's one thing we've never done and it usually works pretty good.
What's that?
How about giving a dance?
A dance!
That's a wonderful idea.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
And I am sure I can get Bill to let us use his lodge hall for nothing.
And we can decorate it ourselves and we can all pitch in and make punch.
And we can charge five dollars a couple and make a fortune.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
We have forgotten one very important item.
Well, I don't know what.
We got the hall, we got the refreshments, we got the decorations.
What else do you need for a dance?
An orchestra.
Oh, gee, you couldn't get much of an orchestra for $1.14, could you?
Maybe we could buy ten kazoos and play them ourselves.
Oh, that was a good idea.
What a shame.
Hey!
Wait a minute.
We forgot about me.
I'm married to an orchestra.
Oh, but, Lucy, Ricky wouldn't play for us for nothing, would he?
Of course he would.
All I'd have to do is ask him.
And you know what he'd say?
Yeah, and I don't want to hear it.
Now, Ethel, you know he'd love to do it.
And listen, if we get them we can use a Latin- American theme.
Ooh, we can call it "A Night in Havana.
" With those hats and cucarachas Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Shh.
Hello, dear.
Hi.
Yeah, the meeting's going on right now, dear.
That's what I called you about.
Listen, the girls are going to give a big benefit dance.
Well, the benefit is for us.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, so I told the girls that you'd be glad to play for us for nothing.
Yeah, well, good-bye, dear.
Where do we go to get the kazoos?
Well, that was a nice idea.
Now what will we do to raise money?
Gosh, I didn't think he'd do it, though.
Wait a minute.
Why can't we form our own orchestra?
Ethel, you play the piano, don't you?
A little.
I can fool around on the drums.
And Neeva Summer plays the violin.
And Marie Deemo plays the trumpet.
Well, we all play something, so why not?
Oh, do you really think we could form our own orchestra?
Sure, we could.
We're in great shape.
Uh, nobody mentioned it, but I just take for granted that you want me to be star soloist on my saxophone.
Well, the orchestra idea's out.
Any other ideas Now, Ethel.
on how to raise some money?
Listen, you haven't even heard them play and you want them in the orchestra.
Why don't you want me?
I've heard you play.
Well, thanks.
I've never heard her.
How does she play, Ethel?
When Lucy plays the saxophone, it sounds like a moose with a head cold.
I heard her play "Glow Worm" once and no way Now, listen, just for that I wouldn't be in your orchestra if you begged me.
Ah, you really mean that, Lucy?
Yes, I do.
Good.
Now, if you'll get all your instruments and come up to my apartment     Hi, Rick.
Hi, Fred.
Here's the light bulb you wanted for your bathroom.
I was wondering how you stood Ethel's piano playing.
I said, I was wondering how you stood Ethel's piano playing!
Yeah, ain't that awful?
She's been going at it since 8:00 this morning.
You know, I may have to soundproof this whole darn building.
That orchestra they're forming is liable to set music back 50 years.
Well, she stopped.
She stopped.
Good.
Maybe the piano lid fell on her fingers.
Boy, you ought to be glad Lucy's not practicing on that saxophone of hers.
Yeah, and I don't get it.
But I'd be a fool to ask.
Yeah, well, I can tell you why.
The other girls don't want her in the band.
Oh, that's it, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, hi, Fred.
Hi, Lucy.
I heard your wife practicing on the piano.
Yeah, you and everybody else in the neighborhood.
I hope it didn't bother you.
Oh, no, it didn't bother me a bit.
I like it.
You're bighearted considering Ethel helped kick you out of the band.
Well, yes, I am bighearted.
I even lent her our piano.
Besides, I'm back in the band.
Oh, Ethel didn't tell me that.
She doesn't know yet.
What do you mean, Lucy?
Well, I have a plan, and all I need is the help of my dear, sweet, orchestra-leader husband.
I knew I should not ask.
Now, Ricky, listen to me.
Hey, you should have told me about these before.
They work great.
I can't hear a word she's saying.
Now, Ricky, you stop that.
Now, Lucy Now, the least you can do is listen to my plan.
Oh, well, I guess I might as well listen to whatever it is I'm not going to do.
Look, all you have to do is rehearse our orchestra for one or two twiddly little hours.
Nothing doing.
Not me.
But, honey, you just have to.
I can make a deal with them.
They get to work with a famous conductor and I get to be in the band.
Well, you just deal me out of your deal.
Oh, now, Ricky, please.
Nothing doing.
Honey, now I'm not asking very much What do you mean?
I'd spend two hours with a bunch of women Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
Hold it, will you?
Hold it!
Now, listen, kids.
I've known both of you for 13 years and I've seen and listened to a lot of discussions.
So?
Now you're going to harangue about this, aren't you, Lucy?
Yes, I am.
And you're going to nag him.
Well, yes.
And if that don't work, you're going to wheedle.
Probably.
You might even cry.
If all else fails.
And eventually, Ricky, you're going to give in.
Oh, I don't know.
Not necessarily.
Oh, you always do.
Now why don't you save the wear and tear on your nerves, to say nothing of my nerves.
Why don't you do what she wants?
Yeah.
You know something?
I think you're right.
Good.
Thanks, Fred, for saving me so much trouble.
That's all right.
Honey, you can rehearse us tomorrow afternoon.
I'll go practice on my saxophone.
Saxophone Give me those!
Now come on, Fred, you had them all day.
Get your own set.
That's it.
That's it, that's it.
Jane?
Ah, I knew you had one there someplace.
Now now, we're all tuned up.
Let's start.
One two    Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
"Twelfth Street Rag" never sounded like that before.
Oh, is that what it was?
Oh, hi, Lucy.
Hi, Lucy.
Well, if it isn't Ethel Mertz and her makes-you-want-to-stick- your-fingers-in-your-ears music.
Oh, come on, now, no use being sore just 'cause we won't let you play with the orchestra.
Yeah, it's just sour grapes.
Listen, grapes aren't the only thing that's sour around here.
You know what you need, don't you?
What?
You need a professional orchestra leader to help you.
And out of the goodness of my heart, I have arranged for Ricky to come over here and help you out.
Really, Lucy?
Oh, that's wonderful.
I'll go and get him right now.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, boy!
Now I know the newspapers will give us a lot of space.
Look out for a trick.
Oh, Ethel Mertz, I'm surprised at you.
I think it's very nice of Lucy to get Ricky to come down here and help us, especially when we're not going to let her be in our orchestra.
Listen, I know that redhead, and I still say look out for a trick.
Oh, this will make a wonderful publicity spread.
Listen, I'm going to run down and tell the paper.
See you all later!
Bye, Marion.
Maybe we'd better start this again.
Yeah.
I think with a little more practice   Where will I sit?
I told you to look out for a trick.
To get Ricky, we have to take her.
Now, listen, Ethel, from the way this group sounded a minute ago, one more bum note isn't gonna hurt it.
You know, she's got a point there.
Well, okay.
Where will I sit?
Anywhere at all.
Give me my music.
I'm looking for it.
I didn't know we were going to have a saxophone.
Oh.
Try to get that just the way Hi, girls.
Oh, hi, dear.
I think you know the girls, don't you?
Remember Marie, Yeah, sure.
Jane Beebo?
Hello.
How are you?
Hi, Ricky.
Oh, Ricky, it's so nice of you to come down and help us like this.
Yeah, well, yeah, I like to help the women's clubs as much as I can, you know.

Right about this tempo.
Okay?
Here we go.
One, two  Girls, girls, girls.
Girls!
Please.
What's the matter?
This is supposed to be bright and with a bounce.
That's right.
It sounds more like a funeral coming down 12th Street.
Oh, now, Ricky Aw Look, this is the way it's supposed to go.
Right in here, see?
Oh!
We can do that.
Sure.
Okay?
Uh-huh.
Sure.
All right, I'll give you two.
Uh-huh.
One, two   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait Lucy, I think you were playing the wrong note.
I am?
Well, it's kind of hard to tell, but I think it was you, yeah.
Now, can we all take, uh Let's see, the-the first note in the third bar.
Huh?
Okay.
At the same time.
Now, wait a minute.
Are you ready?
Everybody together.
Here we go.
See, it wasn't me.
Lucy What?
Are you playing an F sharp?
Well, I'm not sure.
What do you mean, you're not sure?
Well, are you talking about the fat, little, white note or the black one with the wiggly tail?
The black one with the wiggly tail.
Oh.
Well, what about it?
Is it an F or an F sharp?
Oh.
How can you tell?
If it's an F sharp, it has a little sign by it.
Oh, you mean the lopsided tic-tac-toe?
Ay, que barbaridad lopsided tic-tac-toe.
Yeah, that's an F sharp.
Oh, well, live and learn.
I'm sorry.
I'll do it right next time.
"F" sharp, oh.
All right, now, let's take it all together, huh?
Try to get this.
I tell you what, look, look.
I got an idea.
You take the first bar on the piano, Ethel.
All right.
And then you come in the second bar on the violin.
Lucy, you come in the third bar and then you finish it, Carolyn, all right?
Yeah.
Sort of an arrangement.
Yeah, yeah.
Here we go.
One, two       Ah, we did it!
Girls, please!
Girls, please, don't stop!
But we were so good.
Yeah, I know, you were wonderful, but let's, uh, let's try to do the whole number once, you know, all the way to the end, Yeah.
just once, even if it kills us and it probably will.
Let's go from the top, everybody.
One, two      Hey!
Oh!
Yeah!
Oh!
Oh, wonderful!
Now, girls, you heard that- my boys- the way that my boys played.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, that's the way that it's supposed to sound.
Okay.
Oh, sure!
You think you got it now?
Oh, sure!
Okay, let them try once, huh?
Okay.
Okay.
All right, girls.
You go back and you try it again.
Oh, that was good.
Oh, boy.
Oh, it makes you want to play it right, doesn't it?
Okay.
Oh, boy.
All right.
Now, let me hear it just that way, now.
Yes, sir.
Okay, I'll give you two.
One, two   Choo!
Lucy Yeah oh.
Honey, I forgot.
I promise, I will never hum, whistle, sing or reproduce in any manner "Twelfth Street Rag" in your presence as long as I live.
Good.
Hello.
Lucy?
Thank goodness, you're still alive.
What?
Has Ricky read the morning paper yet?
Yeah.
Why?
Has he seen the last page?
No.
Why?
Don't let him.
Grab it.
Kick it out of his hand or something.
What's the matter?
There's a big picture of Ricky on the last page and an article, from which I quote, "Ricky Ricardo, well-known entertainer "has formed a brand-new, all-girl orchestra and will have its world premiere " Oh, no.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's the mat Oh, yeah, I'll tell you what's the matter.
Well?
Uh I know.
Um, Ethel just told me about a-a sale on a dress that I paid full price for yesterday downtown.
Let me see the paper.
Wait a minute.
I'm reading about the fights.
Uh "Continued on the back page.
" Uh, I can't wait!
This is just terrible.
They can't do a thing like that to me.
I don't have enough money to spend and they made me pay full prize for it!
Lucy!
Yeah?
You bring that paper back here right now.
Okay.
It wasn't the same dress after all.
Lucy!
Yes, sir?
Oh, you got your picture in the paper.
It isn't a very good likeness.
Lucy Yes, sir?
Somebody opened a hole in this paper.
Why, so they did.
Did you do it?
Oh, honey, you know, I wouldn't open a hole in your paper when I know you haven't even read it.
Well, if you didn't do it, and I didn't do it who dood it?
Maybe it was a mouse.
A redheaded mouse?
Well Hey, Rick.
Yeah, Fred?
I was reading about the fights in this paper of mine and I find that half the back page is cut out.
Let me have a look at yours, will you?
Yours, too?
Well, what do you make of this?
That mouse sure gets around, doesn't he?
I don't know about the mouse, but I can sure smell a rat.
Fred, would you like to get your coat and take a stroll down to the corner newsstand with me?
I will.
We'll find out what's cooking around here.
Ethel, come over and take care of little Ricky right away.
It's an emergency.
Hey!
Well, I spoke to Ethel about that paper before I went in to see you, but she just played dumb which wasn't too hard for her to do.
Well, we'll find out now what's going on.
What is this?
I don't know.
They're all the same.
You don't suppose it's some kind of an ad, do you?
No.
Look, I want to find out what was what's been cut out of this paper.
I'll tell you what, let's go down next block.
There's another newsstand down there.
All right.
Oh, I think that's the afternoon edition.
Paper!
Paper!
Get your morning paper!
Read all about it!
The morning paper   Oh, now, Ricky, calm down.
Calm down?
Have you read this thing?
Oh, yeah, but it wasn't Lucy's fault.
Marion Strong put that in the paper.
It was Lucy's fault for getting me involved in this thing at the very beginning Well, I won't do it.
Oh, Marion called up and said they'd sold hundreds of tickets ever since that article appeared.
Well, I don't care.
I am not going to be publicly responsible for your sour sextet.
Hello.
Yeah.
What?
!
Good news, dear?
That was my agent.
Oh?
Yes.
And he read the paper.
Yeah.
In the paper, he read that I was going to appear with an all-girl orchestra, and he thinks that that is a wonderful idea.
So, he has arranged it with a television station to put it on TV.
TV?
Oh Oh, TV.
Oh.
Oh, TV.
Somebody better think of a way out of this if she wants to keep her pretty, little neck in one piece.
And think fast.
Well, we sold all the tickets.
This place is jammed.
I know, but do you think it'll work?
We'll find out right now.
I'll make	  the announcement.
Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League takes pride in presenting Mr. Ricky Ricardo and his all-girl orchestra.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Can I borrow some cream?
Shh!
Not so loud.
: Good morning, Lucy.
Can I borrow some cream?
What's the matter?
Someone who shall be nameless is in a Cuban snit this morning.
Oh.
What did you do?
Nothing!
Everything went wrong down at the club last night.
The cleaner forgot to bring his tuxedo.
One act didn't show up.
Right in the middle of his big number, the lights went out all over the whole neighborhood.
Oh.
How long did that last?
For hours.
Everybody got up and, and left and went into the nightclub across the street.
How'd they manage without electricity?
Liberace was playing there.
Huh?
He does his show by candlelight.
Oh.
Sure.
Oh, well, I don't blame Ricky for being sore.
Well, neither do I, but things aren't going to be very pleasant around here today.
He's as grumpy as a kangaroo with a porcupine in his pouch.
You want some coffee?
No, thanks.
Fred's waiting for his breakfast.
I'll just get my cream.
Oh, gee, I envy you, Ethel.
Why?
Because Fred is so predictable.
You never have to worry about what kind of a mood he's going to be in.
Yeah, he's always got a porcupine in his pouch.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Ricky.
That orange juice is sour.
Well, that's not the only thing that's sour around here.
What do you mean?
You might at least say good morning to Ethel.
Hi.
Oh, I liked it better when he ignored me.
Well, don't worry, Ethel.
He'll get over it.
Oh, sure.
He'll soon be his usual old charming, smiling self, won't you, Ricky?
No, Ethel Aw, I can make Ricky smile.
Come on now, Ricky, smile for me.
I can make you smile.
Aw, now, Ricky, how would it be if your face froze like that?
How would it be if you minded your own business?
Well!
Doesn't your little playmate ever go home?
Hi, honey bunch.
Oh, shut up.
Now, what did I do?
You're just as grumpy as he is.
Well, what did I do?
Nothing, Fred.
Ethel's upset at Ricky.
Now, Ricky, you tell Ethel you're sorry for what you said.
I'm sorry, Ethel.
Yeah.
I mean it.
I'm, I'm sorry.
I'm just so upset, I don't know what I'm doing.
Now, what's Lucy done?
Nothing!
Why is it always my fault?
Hmm.
Oh, really, Fred, Lucy had nothing to do this time.
I apologize.
Well, all right.
It's just that everything went wrong at the club last night.
The guy didn't bring my tuxedo Now, honey, honey, honey The guy went out Listen, honey, honey, in the middle don't talk about it anymore.
You're just going to get yourself all upset again.
Okay.
I'm telling you, anybody that goes into show business should have his head examined.
I would quit the whole thing for two centavos.
Oh I wish I had a nickel for every time he's offered to quit show business for two centavos.
Well, if I had any sense, I'd be in some regular business.
Any business is a pain in the neck.
Not like show business.
Not much.
How do you think I feel worrying every time a tenant is going to move out and listening to all their silly complaints?
: "My drain is stopped up"!
"I've lost my key"!
"When are you going to fix my leaky faucet"?
!
Listen, speaking about leaky faucets, when are you gonna Uh not now.
No, not now, Lucy.
I'm telling you, I'm gonna keep my eye open for a real business and when I find it, bye-bye, show business.
Okay.
Let me know when you find something.
All right.
Come on, Ethel.
I'm hungry.
Okay, see you later.
All right, dear.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, yeah Oh, hi, Poppy.
Hi.
How are you?
Hey, did you have a nice walk, old man?
Yes, but he's getting tired.
Oh, what's up, baby?
Hello, son, how are you?
Are you still looking at those want ads?
Yes, Mommy, I'm still looking at them.
We got to take our nap.
Okay, sweetheart, take your nap.
Come on, baby, darling.
Well, we let him stay up too long.
Come on, baby, darling.
Hi, Rick.
Oh, hi, Fred.
Oh, boy, what a swell day.
How about a little game of golf?
Uh, I'd love to, Fred, but I'm looking into some business opportunities here that I might go into.
Oh, you're really serious, huh?
You're darn right I am.
Well, if you find something good, let me know.
Hey, were you serious this morning when you offered to go into it with me?
I don't remember offering, but if you've got a good deal, sure I'm in.
Fred, don't encourage him.
I've gone through this with him a million times.
Never mind.
Now, here's some of the ones that look best.
Yeah.
"Delicatessen for sale, cheap.
"  You know, the one down on the corner makes a mint.
Oh, Ricky, a delicatessen.
What's wrong with a delicatessen?
I can just see it: "Ricky Ricardo's Delicatessen.
Cuban-Style Blintzes.
" She's right, Rick.
It doesn't quite have the right ring.
Well, there's a lot of stuff here.
All right, let's see it.
Lucy?
What?
Is Fred over here?
There he is, with Ricky Ricardo, the Salami King.
Huh?
They're figuring out what business to go into.
Business?
Yeah.
Fred Mertz, what's this about you going in business?
I haven't made any deal.
I thought if we saw something good, we might go in it.
After all, we've got a few bucks put aside.
Oh, have you, Ethel?
Only every dollar we ever made, that's all.
Hey, it might be fun if we were all partners.
Let me see that list, Ricky.
I'll read it to you.
Oh, the delicatessen is out, you said, so  How about a cocktail bar?
No.
Now, the next one is something I've always wanted to own.
What's that?
A diner.
A diner?
Diner?
Honey, we don't know anything about running a diner.
Fred and I do.
We worked in one once when we were stranded in Indianapolis.
Remember, Fred?
Really?
Sure.
"Adam and Eve on a raft.
Wreck 'em.
" "Scrambled eggs on toast coming up.
" That's wonderful.
You know, with, with Fred and Ethel's know-how, and I got a good following down at the club, we should have a lot of customers.
Sure.
This is just perfect for the four of us.
Fred and I have the know-how and Ricky has the name, and Lucy has Uh Lucy has, uh My name is the same as his.
Ah, don't you worry, honey.
There'll be plenty for all of us to do.
Oh, sure, we couldn't do anything without you.
That's right.
I hope not.
Look at that.
Don't you think that looks good?
"Enjoy security and independence by owning your own business.
Fully equipped " Well, that's it, folks.
Isn't this the sweetest little diner you ever saw?
Oh, it's a darling.
Just cute as a bug.
You say this place does good business?
You ought to see 'em.
Three deep at the counter all day long.
Really?
Uh-huh.
We have to close once a week to let the seats cool off.
Well, would you, uh, pardon us?
Uh may I Certainly.
Excuse us a minute, please.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
You want to do it?
Okay, okay.
Well, Mr. Watson, you just sold a diner!
Wonderful.
I know you won't be sorry.
Will you just sign this purchase agreement, and I'll meet you at the bank in the morning to complete the deal.
Yes, sir.
Looks all right, huh, Fred?
Fine, yeah.
That's right.
Okay.
Sign it, Fred.
Yes, sir.
Here are the keys.
Oh.
Easy.
There you are!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Well, I'll see you  at the bank.
Yes, sir.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, isn't he a nice man?
He sure is.
We own a diner, we own a diner!
Isn't it wonderful?
Hey, we got to take this sign down.
Oh, that's right.
Yeah!
Oh, we'll have to get another name.
What'll it be?
Well, now, let's see, uh I got it.
I got it!
Oh, you go ahead, Fred.
No, you go ahead.
Well, I was just thinking out loud, you know, but, uh, how about, uh, Ricky's place?
You know, I had the same thought.
You did?
With one slight change.
What's that?
Fred's place.
Now, look, Fred, yesterday you said that you got the know-how and I got the name and my name ain't Fred.
Uh, look, I think people like to eat where a woman does the cooking.
I think we should use a woman's name.
What woman's name did you have in mind?
Uh, it starts with an "L".
Lucy That's right.
Oh  Now, now, look.
Now, look.
Now, look, there's no use arguing about this.
I tell you what we'll do.
What?
Well, let's not use any of our names.
Why not?
Well, my idea was to have a diner that, uh, served Cuban food.
Yeah.
Right?
All right.
So, let's use something different and catchy like, uh A Little Bit Of Cuba.
Hey, I like that.
I like that.
Huh, you like that?
A Little Bit of Cuba.
Oh.
Have a good dinner, Ralph?
Oh, very fine.
Well, I'm glad you came over.
There you are.
Thank you, and come again.
Thank you for coming, boy.
Say hello to the family.
I will.
Good-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh, hello, Joe!
Hi, Ricky.
Hi, Joe.
Look- Joe!
Lucy, howdy.
What do you think of the place, huh?
It's a swell spot.
Yeah, this is terrific.
Come on, I got a ringside seat right here for you.
Oh, thanks.
Sit right down there, Joe.
There you are, Joe.
Oh, thanks, Lucy.
Nice to see you.
Fred, take good care of my friend Joe here.
Yes, indeed, I will.
Good evening, sir.
What'll you have?
Let's see, uh What's this, "Little Bit of Cuba" Special?
Well, sir, that's something Ricky dreamed up.
It's a hamburger patty smothered in Tabasco sauce and mashed banana between two tortillas.
I think I'll just have a hamburger.
Hamburger?
Rare.
Rare.
What'll you have on it?
Everything but onions.
Walk a cow past the stove and don't cry over it.
Coming up.
And coffee.
Cup of mud coming up.
Hey, Alberto!
Hi, Ricky.
Look, Alberto's here.
Hi, Lucy.
How's Pura?
Bien.
Oh, glad to meet you.
How do you like the place, huh?
Muy bonito.
Come on, I got a nice seat right here for you, boy.
Sit down.
There you are.
There you are.
Hey, Fred, take good care of my friend Alberto here.
Oh, yes, indeed.
Good evening, sir.
What'll you have?
I think I'll try hash.
Hash?
There's a gambler in the house.
Hash coming up.
Gee, honey, isn't this fun?
Oh, it's just great.
Just what I always wanted.
And we're making a whole bunch of money.
I know, and the best part of it it's so easy to run.
Yeah, I'm surprised.
I thought it was going to be a lot of work.
I tell you, it's a cinch.
I know.
I just love it.
Hey, how about my pancakes?
How about my coffee?
Coming right up.
Where are those pancakes?
You didn't order any hotcakes.
I did, too.
Well, I didn't hear you.
Here are your four hot dogs, though.
I didn't order hot dogs.
Well, somebody did.
How about my pancakes?
They're coming right up.
Uh, yes, sir, uh, I'll fix them right away, sir.
Well, Marco!
Ricky.
Welcome to A Little Bit Of Cuba!
Sit right down here, boy.
Sit right down there.
There you are, Marco.
Nice to see you.
Ai-yi Things all right over here?
Good, good.
Say, uh  Psst!
We need more butter here.
More butter here.
Who does he think he is?
I'm a partner, too, you know.
How come we're back here doing all the work and they're out there having all the fun?
I don't know, but it's time we made a change.
You're right.
We're gonna have a lot of good food, you know.
We're gonna have arroz con pollo, frijoles, paella, everything.
All the stuff, you know.
There you are.
There you go.
What's that for?
It's time for the swing shift.
What are you doing?
!
Well, we've just been thinking.
Maybe we'd better trade.
You're out here doing all the work, and we're back there having all the fun.
Fred, I don't know what to do back there.
Oh, it's very simple.
You just put the meat on the griddle, and when your face gets redder than the hamburger, it's done.
Ethel, what's the matter with you?
Now, look, Ethel, you are supposed to be behind the counter.
You got the know-how.
And look, Ricky has to be here greeting guests.
He has the name.
Yeah, and I know what it is.
Now, look, for the last time, are you two going to get behind that counter or nut?
For the last time, are you two gonna get behind that counter or "nut"?
No!
It doesn't		 make any sense.
No.
Well, we can't all be out in front, so it'd better be you.
Well, all right.
That's better.
That's more better.
Come on.
Come on, dear.
Where are you going?
What?
Have fun.
How about my hamburger?
Ethel How about my hamburger?
Come on.
I got to go to work.
I can't be hanging around here.
I've got work to do.
Gee whiz  Now, look, the next time that we get a customer in here, will you please try to get the order right?
We had four customers in here today and you loused up every one of their orders.
Well, it's hard to keep track of that many orders.
What are you talking about?
They were each here at different times.
Well, I'm doing my best.
You have to have experience for this kind of work and I've never done it before.
Oh, now, honey, don't cry.
You'll get the food all salty.
Besides, it's all your fault.
My fault?
Yeah, yelling all those crazy things at me.
That was diner talk, like Fred did.
Yeah, well, the next time you want hamburgers without onions, ask for hamburgers without onions.
Don't stand there and yell, "Bring the bull in the ring and laugh in his face"!
Good morning, Ricky.
Good morning.
Good morning, Lucy.
Hello.
Well, I see business is booming.
This is the first lull we had all morning.
Now, listen, once and for all, if we come back, are you going to take turns doing the dirty work?
Now, look, Fred, you got the know-how and I got the name.
I told you, Ethel.
This guy knows two songs: "Babalu" and "You Got The Know-How, I Got The Name Blues.
" That's what we agreed on.
Certainly.
Now get this straight.
Ethel and I are not going to stay back there working our heads off while you two are leading a gay social whirl out front.
Well, this is a fine mess.
What are we going to do about it?
Well, we thought if you wanted to buy us out, we Buy you out?
!
I wouldn't put another cent in this joint.
Well, we haven't got enough money to buy you out.
Well Well, what are we gonna do?
Half of it is yours, and half of it is ours.
Let's split it.
Split it?
Sure.
That would solve everything.
Yours is the half behind the counter and ours is the half in front.
Oh, no, you don't.
What do you want to do, split it down the middle?
Hey, that might be a good idea.
It'd teach you a lesson.
You'd go broke in ten minutes without us showing you what to do.
We'd go broke?
!
Oh, come now Ha!
There wouldn't be a customer in this joint if it wasn't for Ricky's name on the front door.
Well, isn't that funny?
What are you talking about?
I mean that.
I know you don't All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, we'll split it right down the middle and we'll see who does the best.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay!
Okay!
Okay.
All right.
This is our half.
That is your half.
Okay.
Right.
All right.
Either buy something or get off our stool.
What time is it?
What's the matter, have people stopped eating or something?
We could have hung out a sign that said "measles" and done better business.
Don't make jokes.
That's a joke?
Look, it's nothing to kid about, you know.
We're just about to lose 2,000 hard-earned bucks.
I don't know how I ever got mixed up into this.
Why did I let Fred talk me into this?
Me?
!
You're the one that wanted to quit show business.
Don't blame it onto me.
You had the name.
Yeah, and you had the know-how.
Where's your know-how now?
We got no customers no-how.
Oh, what's the difference who has the know-how who has the name?
Who has the customers?
Yeah.
Where are the customers?
Where do you want these?
Oh, right here.
Right here, please.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Would you put them in the middle, please?
We have to divide them.
Thank you very much.
I'd like to report a missing rail.
This isn't a bar, it's a diner.
We serve food here.
Food?
!
Yeah.
How about something to eat?
Yeah, right over here, sir.
I'll drink to that.
Right here.
Right here.
Oh, right over here, sir.
Here you are, sir.
Right here.
Right here.
Mister, mister mister.
Mister, mister Ethel, we're trying to get him over here, not drive him away.
Mister, b-best hamburgers in town, 15 cents.
Well, that sounds pretty good.
Uh look, mister.
Well, I like to save a penny when I can.
That's right, sir.
Sit right down.
We'll get it for you right away.
Mister, 13 cents.
Look, mister, ten cents.
Ten cents.
Five cents.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
One-cent hamburgers.
Ethel, are you losing your mind?
Well, I don't want them to get him.
One-cent hamburgers.
Here you go.
I'd like a hundred hamburgers.
I'm sorry, we're all out of hamburgers.
Yeah.
They're all out of hamburgers.
Well, it's just as well, sir.
You wouldn't have liked them anyway.
Yeah, even at a cent apiece, they're overcharging you.
Yeah.
At least we put meat in ours.
Yeah.
And just what are you insinuating we put in ours?
I'm not saying, but you can bet on it in the afternoon and eat it at night.
So help me, I'm gonna Go ahead.
Throw it.
Oh, wouldn't I love to.
You wouldn't dare!
Oh, wouldn't I?
!
Lucy!
Ethel!
Come on, and I'd like to see a good pie fight!
Ethel, those pies cost money, you know.
Girls!
Go back to work!
Back to work, everybody.
Come on, now.
Stop fooling around.
Let's go back to work.
Come on.
Okay, Lucy you asked for it.
Girls, what are you doing?

Girls!
What are you doing?

Look at : Oh, no!
Oh, you silly people.
Oh, Mr. Watson!
LUCY AND  Oh, hello, Mr. Watson.
Hi, Mr. Watson.
Hello, Mr. Watson.
What can we do for you, Mr. Watson?
Well, I come down to see what I could do for you, but you seem to be having lots of fun.
Just a little recreation.
We're entertaining our customers.
Oh.
Well, to tell the truth, I got lonesome for the old place, and I just dropped down to look around.
I sure miss it.
Oh?
Really?
Oh, yeah.
Uh well, Mr. Watson, I don't blame you for missing the place because, you know, it's, it's really a gold mine.
Oh, yeah, it's better than we ever thought it was gonna be.
Crowded all the time.
Yes, sir.
You really miss it, eh?
You miss it, huh, Mr. Watson?
I sure do.
Matter of fact, I'm sorry I sold it.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah, well, we sure don't want you to be unhappy, Mr. Watson.
Maybe I can talk Ricky and Fred into giving it up.
Oh, well, I don't know about that.
I'd certainly like to have it back.
Yeah, he'd like to have it back, dear.
Well, I mean, if you really feel that way, we'll see what we can do about it.
Yeah.
I mean, we we paid $2,000 for the place.
Yeah.
$2000, that's right.
And we put a lot of work in this place.
We've done a lot of things, Mr. Watson.
And we've developed quite a clientele, you know.
Everybody from the club comes down here, you know.
But, uh, we, we don't want you to be sad about it and we like you.
You're a real nice man.
So I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll let it go for $3,000.
I can only give you 1,200.
We'll take it.
Good.
You just bought yourself back a diner.
Yes, sir, you bought yourself a diner.
We'll be the first ones to eat with you.
Yeah, we'll come in and have a piece of pie.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Careful now.
Careful, fellas.
Listen, my good man.
You have been so nice.
I want you to have this and take it home to your family.
For me?
Yes, sir.
Well, thank you.
You're welcome.
It's a shame.
They're such nice people.
Nobody makes any money these days.
I do.
I make a fortune.
How?
Selling this place and buying it back from people who want to go into business for themselves.
Why, you.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Oh, boy, it's been a long time since I saw a movie that good.
Those Italians make great pictures, don't they?
Yeah, those women were lookers all right.
But I couldn't understand what the picture was all about.
If it isn't Donald Duck, it's over his head.
Honestly.
Lucy, didn't you think when she What's the matter, Lucy?
Are you sick?
Oh, no, no, don't pay any attention to her, Ethel.
Every time she goes to a movie she comes out as the heroine.
It will take a couple of hours to wear off.
Arrivederci, mi amore.
Mi amore, arrivederci.
What's the matter with her?
What do you mean "what's the matter with her"?
Can't you see that this poor women's husband has just been taken to jail?
And she's left there with 12 children that she has to support.
She has to work in the rice field to support them.
Thank you, Lucille Magnani.
How can you be so blase?
Don't you feel what she felt?
Oh, I think those Italian actresses are just wonderful.
They're so sultry and exciting.
They're so so Italian.
Oh, I'd like to look like that.
Oh, what I wouldn't give if I looked like one of them.
What I wouldn't give if you looked like one of them.
Molto bene.
Bellissimo bambino.
Hey, senora, calma down.
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to get an Italian haircut.
Oh, no, you're not.
Why not?
Because I like your hair the way it is.
But it would look so good short.
Please?
Look, for my son's sake, no.
What do you mean, "for your son's sake"?
I'll splain.
Okay, "splain.
" Look, all people in the world are divided into two groups- men and women.
I know.
It's a wonderful arrangement.
Right.
Now, men have short hair, and women have long hair.
That's the difference between them.
Oh?
Now, I don't want my son to be confused.
He should know whether he should call you mother or father.
Oh, you men.
You make me sick.
You know, something, Lucy?
I think I'll get one of those Italian haircuts.
Now, Ethel, don't get carried away.
Leave bad enough alone.
Now, I looked pretty good last year when I had my hair cut in a poodle cut.
People couldn't take their eyes off of me.
Sure, they thought you were Harpo Marx.
It doesn't make any difference what you say.
If I want my hair cut short, Oh, Ethel, what's the use?
What's the use?
I'll cut my hair If we want to stay married we're going to have to go through life with our heads in a rut.
Morning, Doug.
Good morning, Mrs. Ricardo.
How are you this morning?
Fine.
Roberta ready?
I think so.
Just a moment.
Roberta, Mrs. Ricardo's here.
Oh, that's the new Italian look, you know.
Yes, I know.
I'd have the new Italian look except for a certain Cuban look.
Good morning, Mrs. Ricardo.
Hi, Bert.
You ready?
Yeah, come on in.
Doug, get me a cup of coffee, will you?
Sure.
Well, what will it be today, the usual?
Yeah, I guess so.
My You should have come in sooner.
You've got quite a firebreak here.
Now, listen, Bert, no cracks or I'll take my dark roots somewhere else.
Oh, you know, I wanted to get one of those new Italian cuts but Ricky won't let me.
Oh, that's a shame.
You'd look darling with your hair short.
Well, I thought so, but he put his foot down.
He does a lot of that, doesn't he?
Yeah.
If you could harness the energy he uses putting his foot down you could light the whole city of New York.
I get so mad at husbands.
They have no imagination about their wives.
No, but they have You know what you should do?
What?
Well, you know, you're just going to be a knockout with an Italian haircut.
Surprise him.
Let me cut your hair short and fix it real cute and then spring it on him.
He'll die.
Well, one of us will.
No, I don't think that's a very good idea.
Oh, listen Do you think that wig out front would fit me?
Well, yeah, I think so.
Well, get it and let me try it on.
Oh, sure.
Okay.
Just give me an idea of how I'd look, you know?
Here we are.
This is fun, isn't it?
Yeah.
I don't suppose it'll do much good, but Oh, well, at least you can tell.
It will give me an idea anyway.
Let's see.
Where did I go?
You look wonderful.
Is that me?
Sure.
Paisan!
Mrs. Ricardo, here's your coffee Oh, pardon me.
Mrs. Ricardo?
Yeah, it's me.
How do you like it?
Why, you look wonderful in that wig.
I didn't know you at all.
What a difference, huh?
I can't get over the difference.
Hey, Bert, Ricky's going to pick me up here.
Doug, can I leave this on till he gets here?
Sure, go ahead.
You know, if he likes it, maybe he'll let me get my hair cut.
Well, it's sure worth a try.
What do you think he'll say?
I don't think he'll say anything.
I don't think he'll know it's you.
Oh, he'll know it's me Well, I don't know.
Gee, if he didn't recognize me I'm in a dream spot.
What do you mean?
I could find out how my husband would react to a little flirting by a strange brunette with an Italian haircut.
Oh, hi, Mr. Ricardo.
Hi.
Is this what we have to look forward to next season?
No.
Is Mrs. Ricardo ready?
Well, uh, we finished a little early and she went to do some shopping.
She said for you to meet her out front and if she's not there by 1:00, don't wait for her.
Okay, thank you.
Bye.
Gee.
Psst.
Psst.
Mr. Ricardo?
Yeah?
Could I speak to you for a moment?
Sure.
Shh.
As the owner of this shop I should respect my customer's wishes, but as a fellow husband I have to tell you something.
What?
You're wife is going to play a very dirty trick on you.
Oh?
You know the new Italian haircut?
She didn't!
Shh.
No, but she did try on a brunette wig with an Italian haircut.
Looks like an entirely different woman.
You wouldn't recognize her.
Oh, I'd recognize my wife.
Now, don't be too sure.
I didn't recognize her and I've known her for quite a while.
Anyway, she's going to test you with a little flirtation.
If you recognize her, fine.
If you don't Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Mira que esta mujer se ocurra cosa extrana en la cabesa.
That's exactly the way I feel about my wife.
You speak Spanish?
No.
Those feeling transcend all language barriers.
Well, I just wanted to be sure that you'd recognize her.
What do you mean "recognize her"?
I'm not going to recognize her.
Huh?
Look, as long as she's in the driver's seat it would be a shame not to take her for a little ride.
Miss?
Oh, uh you dropped your glove.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Haven't I seen you someplace before?
Well uh, it's possible.
I've been someplace before.
Well, I'm sure we've met.
Have you ever been to the Tropicana nightclub?
Oh, why, of course, you're Ricky Ricardo.
That's right.
Oh, well, I should have known.
Well Um Look, uh, I tell you what, how would you like to come down to the club one night as my guest?
Well, don't you have to work when you're at the club?
Oh, for you I could find plenty of time.
You and I could make beautiful music together.
I could even teach you how to rumba.
What's the matter?
Look we can't talk here.
I'm expecting my wife.
Oh, you're married.
Well, everybody makes a mistake once in awhile.
I tell you what, honey, call me down at the club.
That old battle-ax is going to be here any minute.
Well, tell me, what is your wife like?
I suppose she's very beautiful.
Well, she's she's she's kind of hard to describe.
Her figure is kind of and her hair is all She's a good housekeeper.
Look, honey, I think I see her coming.
Now, will you run along, dear?
All right.
And call me at the club.
Don't forget.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Is that you, Lucy?
Oh, I beg your pardon, madam, but you're in the wrong apartment.
It's me.
Who?
Lucy!
Lucy?
!
How's the baby?
He's fine.
Oh, Lucy!
You died your hair black and cut it all off short.
Oh!
It looks wonderful!
It's a wig.
A wig?
Oh what a difference.
I honestly didn't know you.
You're not the only one.
Who else?
A certain Cuban with big brown eyes that are soon to be black.
The details, the details.
Well, Bert tried this wig on me, and nobody recognized me, so I figured I'd have a little fun with Ricky.
You know, I thought if he might like the haircut, he'd let me have my hair cut and everything would be hotsie-totsie.
Well?
Things were never so coldsie-toldsie.
Why?
What happened?
Well, I borrowed these clothes Those clothes!
No wonder I didn't know you.
Neither did Ricky.
I flirted with him a little and what do you think he had the nerve to do?
What?
He flirted back.
I'll bet he knew it was you all the time.
He did not.
He leered at me and called me "honey" in a tone that I haven't heard since the day before we got married.
And then he told me to call him at the club.
And get this bit- Said he wanted to "tich" me to rumba.
And then he said, run along because his wife was coming along- or, as I am more commonly known, "the old battle-ax.
" Well, it's a terrible thing to say about anybody, but I guess Ricky's just a man.
Yeah, well, I'll get even with him.
What are you going to do?
I'll leave him!
No.
That's probably what he wants.
Yeah.
Stay married to him.
That'll teach him.
Yeah.
Well, I'll think of something.
Hey, Lucy.
What?
Do me a favor, will ya?
What?
Lend me that wig.
What for?
I want to try it on Fred.
Oh, he'd look great in it.
No, I mean, I want to see if he'd recognize me with it on.
Look out.
That's how I got into trouble.
That's the kind of trouble I want.
I want something to hold over his head.
Well Come on, loan me the wig, huh?
Okay.
Have you got a dress that will fit me?
You think he'll recognize yours?
I think so, considering I only have one.
Come on, I'll find you something.
Okay.
Yeah, Fred, it's the basin.
Well, it's all stopped up.
Would you come over and fix it?
Thank you.
Ethel?
Did you call me, darling?
Wow!
I called Fred.
I told him the basin was all stopped up.
He's coming right over.
That's great.
Gee, turn around.
Let me look at you.
When I tell Fred who you are, he's going to beg you to have your hair cut like that.
You really think so?
Yeah.
How you going to act?
Well, I thought I'd sort of flirt with him.
You know, act coy and bat my eyes.
And then if he responds, I'll lower the boom on him.
Hi, Fred.
Hi, Lucy.
Which sink is it?
The one in the bathroom.
Oh.
Hi, Ethel.
Ethel, what in Sam Hill have you done to your hair?
It's a wig.
Huh?
We've been married for 25 years and now she tells me she wears a wig!
Oh, go fix the plumbing.
Now I'll never know whether I'm married to a masher or not.
I wish I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
I brought the wrong wrench.
Ethel, why don't you take off that silly-looking toupee?
This is that new Italian haircut.
Well, on you it looks like Life with Luigi.
He'll never fall for another woman.
I just don't have that kind of luck.
Ethel, do you really want to put him to the test?
Do I?
What do you suggest?
Well, when I arrange my rendezvous with Ricky, I'll suggest he make it a double date.
Yeah?
I'll ask him if he has a friend.
Yeah?
I'll tell him I have a friend who's looking for an older man.
Older than Fred?
You know what I mean?
He'll bring Fred, all right.
Oh, how we gonna keep him from recognizing me?
He just did.
Oh, I don't know.
Honestly.
Hey!
I know the wardrobe woman in a Broadway review!
She could let me have something- maybe an entirely different kind of a wig and a and another sort of an outfit.
Yeah, maybe you could wear different makeup or something.
Oh, sure.
I'll bet she'll loan me anything I want.
I'm going to call her and see.
Oh, I hope so.
Gee, that's a wonderful idea.
Hello.
Hello, is Mother Carroll there?
May I speak to her, please?
Maybe she could get me one of those showgirl outfits, you know, with a great big hat Hello?
Mother Carroll?
This is Ethel.
Mertz.
Yeah, listen, I'm in an awful jam.
Could you loan me a wig and some sort of costume, an outfit, to wear?
Tonight.
Well, just for one night.
No.
We wouldn't need it till after the show.
You could?
Oh, fine.
What have you got?
Huh?
What'd she say?
Well, I got three choices: a Japanese geisha girl or an American Indian or an Eskimo.
An Eskimo?
Yeah Huh?
Oh, oh, all right, honey.
We'll be down at the theater.
Thanks a lot.
She says to come on down.
She can get some sort of an outfit together.
Yeah, they got a lot of costumes down there.
Look, now, I'll call Ricky and tell him we'll meet him at Tony's- the little Italian restaurant.
Yeah, great.
Sit down, please.
Tell me, Fred, what are you going to be doing about Well, snoring my head off.
Why?
Can I talk you out of it?
I don't think so, Rick.
I've been going to bed at 10:00 for ten years.
Uh, I really need the rest.
Well, that's too bad.
What did you have in mind?
I could make a date for you with a beautiful girl.
Where will I meet you?
You changed your mind in an awful hurry.
What happened to this rest you've been getting for years?
Well, what do you think I've been resting up for?
Uh, look, I made a date this afternoon.
You?
Yeah.
I made a date this afternoon with a beautiful brunette with a short Italian haircut.
And, uh, she called me at the club and she said she has a girlfriend and they want to make it a double date.
And this girlfriend told me told her that she prefers the more sophisticated, older-type men.
: Well, how do you do, my dear?
I am delighted to meet you.
: Hey, what is this?
You've never done anything like this before.
Oh, Lucy knows all about it.
Oh What?
!
You see, the brunette with the Italian haircut is Lucy with a wig.
Huh?
She borrowed the wig from a beauty parlor.
Oh then your date is really going to be Lucy.
That's right.
And I got a slight hunch that the girlfriend she's bringing along is Ethel.
On second thought, Rick, I need my rest.
Now, since when have you been too tired to play a trick on Ethel?
Well, if you're going to put it that way I can't hardly resist.
Okay, now, here's what I want you to do Uh, good night, honey.
I got to go to work.
Good night.
Anything you want me to get before I go?
No.
Uh, something I can bring you?
Just bring yourself home, I'll be satisfied.
Well, good-bye, dear.
Good-bye.
I just saw Ricky leave.
Fred's getting ready.
Good, then he fell for it.
Oh, he says he has to sit up tonight with a sick friend.
Well, that "sick friend" is going to be a lot sicker when I get through with him.
I wish you could have seen Fred getting dressed.
I haven't seen him move that fast since he backed into a hot radiator in his union suit.
Well, I knew it, Ethel.
He's just as bad as Ricky is.
Oh, I can hardly wait till we meet them.
Say, what are we going to do till Well, we have to go down to the theater and pick up your costume.
I'll go get Mrs. Trumbull to take care of little Ricky.
Maybe we can go to a midnight movie.
Great.
Now, Ethel, whatever you do, don't Come on!
Come on, Ethel.
You look fine.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
I'm just not going to go in there.
Now, Ethel, believe me.
You look exotic, exciting.
Now, you look fine.
Only to a Japanese Eskimo.
Well, We're not going to back out now.
Come on.
If I could have just got one complete outfit that fit.
But you know this is silly.
Come on.
Come on, now, Ethel.
Come on.
Come on.
They're not here.
Well, come on, sit down.
Take off your coat.
No.
Take off your coat.
You look more conspicuous with it on than you would with it off.
That's what you think.
You look like an ad for a trip around the world.
That does it, brother.
I'm not going any farther Now, come on, Ethel, sit down here.
Now, sit down.
This thing is alive.
Oh, dear, it's 20 after 2:00.
Are you sure they said "Tony's"?
I'm positive.
Oh, waiter, pardon me, please.
Yes, ma'am.
We have an appointment with a couple of gentlemen.
Have you seen them?
What do they look like?
Well, one is tall, dark and handsome and speaks with an accent.
And the other is, um uh the other is, uh There's one way to say it- short, fat and bald.
Oh, yeah, they were here.
Were here?
There were two young ladies sitting at that table.
Beautiful- a blonde and a redhead.
They got talking and then they all got up and left together.
Oh, Ethel Oh, Lucy It's all our fault.
If we hadn't made a date to meet them here, they wouldn't have met those other girls.
Yes.
You know what?
I wish I was dead.
You know what?
I wish you was dead, too.
Me?
Well, you started all of this.
Well, let's not fight each other.
We're all we've got.
Yeah.
Well  Come on, let's go home.
All right.
Are you free tonight, girls?
Ricky!
Were you expecting an older man?
Fred!
Listen, let's get out of here, girls, before my wife shows up- that old battle-ax.
Oh, so you were playing a little trick.
You think you're very clever, don't you?
Come on, Ethel.
Ricky!
Fred!
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Hi.
Oh, hi, Fred.
This special-delivery letter just came for you.
Oh, thanks.
You're welcome.
Don't you want to know what it's about?
It looks important.
You've got the wrong Mertz.
You're thinking about the Buttinsky branch of the family.
I'll go tell Ethel to put on her earphones and stand by for a news flash.
Okay.
Ricky!
Ricky!
Special delivery!
Huh?
Who is it from?
My mother.
Now, Ricky.
It must be important.
It can't be important to me.
She doesn't even know I'm alive.
Oh, honey, she does, too.
She always writes to both of us.
Yeah?
Sure.
Who's that letter addressed to?
"Miss Lucy McGillicuddy.
" Uh-huh.
Well, honey, you know how mothers are.
To Mama, I'll always be her little daughter Lucy McGillicuddy.
But she knows who I'm married to.
Yeah?
Then why does she always write: "Dear Lucy, How are you, and how is what's-his-name"?
Oh, honey.
"Dear Lucy, How are you, and how is Xavier"?
Xavier?
Well, honey, she knows I'm married to a Latin-American bandleader.
She just doesn't know which one.
Well, that's true.
She's getting warmer all the time.
"I love the pictures of the baby, and I'm relieved to see that he looks just like you.
" Instead of Xavier.
Oh Now, honey.
"The real reason I'm writing "is because I went to my club meeting yesterday.
"You remember Flo Pauline Lopis, "the club recording secretary.
"Well, it seems that "Flo Pauline's old college roommate, Ella Scott Porter, "has a cousin who married a man named Ford and went to live in a little town in Tennessee.
" Wake me up when you get to the spicy stuff.
"Well, it seems this cousin has a boy named Ernest.
"She has an older boy named George "and a younger boy named Roger.
"Ernest is her middle boy.
Well, to make a long story short " It's too late.
"To make a long story short, "Ernest is on his way to New York, "and I told Flo Pauline "to tell Ella to tell her cousin to tell Ernest that you'd be glad to entertain him.
" Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
She just caught my interest.
Uh, "of course I don't know Ernest personally, "but any friend of Flo Pauline's roommate's cousin "is a friend of mine.
Love, mother.
" Now, look, you write to your mother right away and you tell her that we're going out of town.
Oh, honey, sh-she says he's on his way.
There isn't time to write her.
Oh, great.
Another visitor.
Just what I needed!
That makes three of them this month.
What's the matter, doesn't anybody ever stay home anymore?
Now, honey, it won't hurt us to be nice to him.
After all, it's my mother's friend's roommate's cousin's middle boy.
Oh, I didn't realize that.
That's different.
Now, now, honey, will you be nice to him?
Look, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll take him out to dinner once, and I'll have him down at the club as my guest once, and that's the end of it.
Well, that's fine.
I think Mother would be very happy about that.
There you are.
And that's 12, 14, 15.
"L-u-c-k-e-I".
"Luckel.
" Luckel?
That's not a word.
It is, too!
Well, I never heard it.
Use it in a sentence.
Well, like, uh when you take a ride in a Fifth Avenue bus, you can either take the 'spress or the luckel.
That is "local.
" That's what I said, luckel.
And for your information, it's spelled I-o-c-a-I.
Now take that back.
Wait till I get you in a jai alai game.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
The baby's still asleep.
I'll take care of that.
?
Que le pasa que toca el guitar at 6:30 in the morning?
!
Honey, he's our guest.
Now, remember As she glides along the woodland To the hills and by the shore.
Oh, good morning, folks.
Do you know what time it is?
Yeah.
It's nigh on to half past 6:00.
I- I don't know what got into me oversleeping like I did.
But I can see that I ain't the only one that's been a-beatin' the sheets.
Uh, did you sleep well, Ernie?
I don't know when I've had a better night's rest.
Now at home, generally, I toss and turn, but not in that thing.
Now, look here, old man.
I want to say something to you.
I know what you're going to say.
It's about the "geetar.
" Well, sir, I seen it a-standin' there and my eyes bugged out like a stomped-on toad frog.
Everything just went plukey.
You know, I had one of these geetars, but these bus fares to New York come pretty dear.
You mean you sold your geetar to get to New York?
Yep.
Fella give me $27 for it and I come all the way here and I got a little bit left, too.
Wait a minute.
There she is.
expenses here?
Your clothes?
Your meals?
Your?
Your, your, your hotel bills?
Well, I worried some about that.
I don't anymore.
I come here to the big city alone, no friends, no acquaintances, and you took me to your bosom.
You're, you're, you're just a mama and a papa to me.
You made me feel like I was wanted and that I belonged.
I've got a home.
Oh.
Gee, thanks for helping me home with these, Ethel.
That's all right.
Say, am I wrong or didn't you buy a big load of groceries yesterday?
I buy a big load of groceries every day since the bottomless pit arrived.
Can he hear us?
No.
He's up on the roof till the noon whistle.
Up on the roof?
Yeah.
I think he's getting a suntan.
The tactful way he put it was: "I ain't aiming to get as fish-belly white as you 'uns.
" I just love the way he talks.
Well, he is cute, but oh, gee  Lucy!
Yes, dear?
What happened to these?
What's the matter with them?
What's the matter with them?
They don't make no noise!
I was rehearsing with them.
I thought I was going deaf!
Who did it?
!
Ernie.
He was only trying to help.
Help?
!
Well, he thought they were broken because they rattled inside.
Ay, dios mio!
Dios mio, que estupido!
My grandfather gave me these maracas when I was ten years old!
I know, dear.
Well, that does it.
Out he goes.
Now, Ricky Out!
Oh!
What about my mother?
Never ask me a question like that when I'm in this condition.
Ernesto!
Oh, now, Ricky Oh, Lucy, it's better this way.
Oh, I suppose you're right.
One big explosion and get it over with.
Cousin Lucy, where are you at?
I'll be right there, Ernie.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Yes, Ernie?
Oh, here you are.
I'm a-writing to Mama and as a speller, I ain't never took no ribbons.
Would you look this over and get the spelling bloopers before I mail it?
Sure.
Not that mama can read, but I just don't want her to be embarrassed if she finds somebody to read it to her.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, Ernie?
Yeah?
Wou-Would you run down to the corner mailbox and, and look and see what time they pick up the mail?
All righty.
We want to make sure that we get your mama's letter off on time.
That's a good idea.
Listen to the jingle  Where is he?
I sent him down to the corner.
What's the matter with you?
You know I want to talk to him.
Honey, I want you to hear this before you talk to him.
Now sit down a minute.
It's a letter to his mother.
All right.
Now just listen to this.
"Dear Ma, "How is my hound dog and how are you?
"Ma, you was all wrong about New York.
"I ain't seen hide nor hair "of no wicked city woman like you warned me against "with their painted lips and painted cheeks.
"But if'n I do, I'll mind what you said "and hightail it right back to Bent Fork.
"Cousin Euncey sure done me a good turn "when she sent me to the Ricardos.
"They is two of the finest critters on this earth.
"They is true blue.
"Ma, they give me a bed and all the food I can eat "and every night, before I crawl between the kivvers "and with the bed they give me, this ain't easy- "I get down on my knees and ask the good Lord "to bless cousin Lucy and cousin Ricky, "the two finest people "I ever did know.
Your son, Ernest.
" Now, you still want to have that talk with him?
Oh, you know I can't.
What are we going to do?
I don't know.
Hey.
I got an idea.
Well, I'm so desperate that I'd like to hear it.
The only thing that would make cousin Ernie leave is a real, live, painted-up, wicked city woman.
"A real, live, painted-up, wicked city woman"?
Yeah.
She came down from Birmingham One cold December day As she rolled along the wood line You could hear all the people say She's mighty tall and handsome She's known quite well by all  She's the combination called the Wabash Cannonball  Cousin Lucy, somebody's settin' on your doorbell.
Oh, all right.
I'll get it.
Hello, big boy.
Howdy-do, ma'am.
What's your name, handsome?
I'm Ernest Ford from Bent Fork, Tennessee.
You'll do.
You got quite a hitch in your git-along.
Do you know who I am?
Who?
I'm a wicked city woman.
No!
Like your mother warned you about.
Oh, dear.
Have mercy!
What are you fixin' to do?
I'm going to vamp you.
You are?
Are you a-vampin' me?
Uh-huh.
You know what?
What?
I like it.
You do?
!
Yeah.
This is more fun than skippin' rocks.
Vamp me some more.
No!
Now don't forget what your mother told you.
Oh, she was wrong about that.
She couldn't have meant you.
Yes, she did!
Now you stay away from me.
Now you go home!
I am home.
I live here.
Oh.
Well, then, I'd better go home.
No.
Come back!
Vamp me some more.
No!
City woman!
Come back here!
City woman!
City woman, where you at, you little heifer?
I'll find you if I have to stay here the rest of my born days.
Honey!
Honey!
It's me, Ricky!
Oh, Ricky!
What's the matter, honey?
Didn't you chase him away?
No, he chased me away!
He said he was gonna stay here the rest of his born days.
Well, I'll be ding-donged.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
Lucy!
Yeah?
Oh, no.
Did you miss it?
I certainly did.
The baby left it over at my house.
Well, thanks, honey.
Well, where's Cousin Ernie, your star boarder?
Oh, he went to the zoo again.
He likes to look at those animals, doesn't he?
Well, I think it's about 50-50.
Gee, I wish he had enough money to go back to Tennessee.
Why don't you buy him a ticket?
Oh, we offered to, but he wouldn't accept it.
Won't accept charity, you know.
If he keeps on eating the way he does, we're going to need charity.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi.
I got to go do my dishes.
Okay.
Good luck.
Okay.
Good luck about what?
Getting rid of our star boarder, Cousin Ernie.
Well, honey, your worries are over.
By tomorrow afternoon, somebody's going to be on the way to Bent Fork, Tennessee.
How come?
Well, just, uh get a load of this.
What is it?
This is a bus ticket to Bent Fork.
He won't take it.
I know he won't, but I have a plan that will work.
Oh, I get it.
We'll leave him here; we'll go to Bent Fork.
No, no.
He won't take it because of his pride, right?
Right.
All right, so we won't give it to him.
Suppose he finds it.
Oh Ah Now, where can I put this so he'll be sure to find it?
In the refrigerator.
No, no.
Now, suppose that somebody lost this ticket in the hallway someplace, you know, just, uh like so.
Okay?
Yeah.
And then we ask Ernie to go over to the Mertzes and get something for us.
So, he goes down the hall  Ah!
A ticket.
To Bent Fork!
He can't miss it.
Pretty clever, huh?
Well, it finally happened.
What has?
After 13 years of marriage, you're beginning to think like me.
Please.
Hi, Cousin Ricky.
Hi.
Hi, Cousin Lucy.
Hi.
Hi.
Did you have fun at the zoo?
Yeah, I sure did.
You know, while I was down there, I seen a friend of mine.
Oh?
Which cage was he in?
Cousin Lucy, you are a caution to the jaybirds.
And, you know, this fella's name was Lester Byck, and I run over there to try to talk to him and he just disappeared into the crowd somewhere.
Say, Ernie, Ernie Yeah.
would you do me a favor and go over to Fred Mertz and ask him if he would lend me the sports section?
Why, sure, sure.
What's the spore session?
Uh, that is the sports section in the newspaper.
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.
All right.
Wait a minute.
I seen that around here somewhere this morning.
Wait a minute.
It's right over here Here it is right here.
There you are.
: There.
Thank you.
Uh, Ernie, would you ask Ethel if I could borrow her, uh, potato masher?
No sooner said than did.
Thank you, Ernie.
Okay.
All righty.
Thanks.
Well, I'll be jump-jumpin' ding dang!
He found it.
Where did he go?
I don't know.
That's funny.
He's not there.
Where could he have gone?
You don't suppose he got so excited, he ran down and jumped on the bus?
Not without asking me to pack him a lunch first.
Hey, I hear him coming.
Cock your pistol 'cause you ain't gonna to believe this nohow.
What happened, Ernie?
What happened?
I's going down the hall, and right there on the carpet, ju-just as plain as the nose on your face, was a bus ticket, and do you know whar it was to?
Whar?
Bent Fork!
All the way thar?
Yes, sirree, Bob.
Ain't that a coinkidinky?
Well, imagine, a bus ticket to Bent Fork!
Imagine that.
I bet it made you happy finding it, huh?
Yeah, it did at first, but I got to thinking of the poor critter that lost it.
I said to myself, somewhere, somebody ain't a-goin' to Bent Fork.
Ernie, where is the ticket?
Yeah, where's the ticket, Ernie?
Well, that's the best part of it.
I run down on the street, and the very first fella I seen was the fella that lost the ticket.
You mean you?
Yup.
There he was in a old, poor, raggedy suit and he looked so poorly and I could tell he could ill afford such a loss.
My, the tears of joy run down his face when I give him his ticket.
Ain't it wonderful how a story like that turns out?
Why, looky there.
Cousin Ricky's got tears of joy running down his face now.
Yes, well, would it be possible for you to pick it up and fix it and get it back before my husband gets home tonight?
Well, I'd certainly appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
Lucy, did you hear that explosion a few minutes ago?
Indeed I did.
It came from our living room.
It did?
!
What happened?
Well, cock your pistol, Ethel.
You're not gonna believe this.
Did you ever watch Millikan's Chicken-Mash Hour on television?
No.
Well, there's a man named Lester Byck who is master of ceremonies on Millikan's Chicken-Mash Hour and he also comes from Bent Fork, Tennessee.
Yeah, well, go on.
What happened?
Well, Ernie was watching television, Lester Byck came on and Ernie jumped up and hollered, "Well, I'll be ding-danged if it ain't Cousin Lester!
Hiya, Cousin Lester"!
And he ran over and clapped him on the back- on the tube, I should say.
No.
Yes, and the whole set exploded.
Oh, my goodness.
You are just in time to help me clean up.
Come, girl.
Oh, Lucy!
Oh, my goodness.
Well, how's Cousin Ernie?
Is he hurt?
Don't be silly.
He's on his way down to the television station to tell Cousin Lester he's sorry he hit him so hard.
Now, that boy has got to go.
There must be some way to get rid of him.
Oh, if he just wasn't so darn nice As much as I want to get rid of him, I- I just couldn't hurt him.
Oh Why don't you get him a job?
Oh, we thought of that, but there's only one thing he can do and there's not much demand for a professional eater.
By the time I get that set paid for, I'm not going to be able to keep him in groceries.
The food that that boy can put away, honestly Hey, that ought to do it!
What?
I have a notion that when the food goes, so will Cousin Ernie.
Of course!
I'll tell him we're broke.
Yeah.
I'll, I'll tell him that Ricky lost his job.
Yeah!
Will you help me?
Sure!
Listen, here's what I want Fred and you to do.
From the great Atlantic Ocean to the wide Pacific shore To the green old flowin' mountains To the south bell by the moor She's mighty tall and handsome She's known quite well by all She's a combination called the Wabash Cannonball Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar Cousin Lucy!
Yup!
Is breakfast about ready?
Cousin Lucy, them clothes you're a- wearin' Oh, you noticed them.
I couldn't help it.
That sweater You remind me of my grandma.
Oh.
Uh, Ernie, about breakfast Is it ready?
Um look, Ernie, you know you're welcome to anything we've got, but, uh Come in the kitchen.
Somebody around here has been acting a hog.
No, it's worse than that, Ernie.
Sit down.
There's your breakfast and lunch.
Breakfast and lunch?
Chew it slowly.
It'll last longer.
Go ahead.
It ain't bad.
Will you see who's at the door, Ernie?
Uh-huh.
Hello, Ernie.
Is Lucy home?
Yeah, yeah.
Cousin Lucy!
Hello.
Company's dropped in!
Hello, Ethel.
You poor little thing.
We brought you some food.
Oh!
Thank you.

It's all right.
Bread.
Flour.
Milk.
You saved my baby's life.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
And I brought you an old dress of mine, darling.
Oh, you're so good to me.
Oh, it's beautiful!
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Well, it's the least we could do, considering we got to kick you out of your apartment.
We hate to do it, but you're six months behind on the rent and since we	 I know, heard that please, please, Let's not talk in front of company.
Cousin Ernie doesn't know that Ricky lost his j-o-b.
Now, darling, you know you can count on us for help.
I know.
You're real, true friends.
Thank you.
Come, Fred.
Yeah.
Bye.
Bye.
Ah Cousin Lucy Yes, Cousin Ernie?
I don't want to be a nosey Parker, and, uh, I don't understand this j- o-b, but I think there's something wrong around here.
Whatever makes you think that?
You've got to get up pretty early in the morning to fool old Ernie.
I think there's a polecat in the henhouse.
Well, I guess we can't keep it from you any longer.
You're right, Ernie.
Something is wrong.
Mighty wrong.
Mighty wrong.
We're broke.
Ricky's lost his job.
We're penniless.
Now, now, now, Cousin Lucy, don't you go and take on like that.
Now, now, now, now, now.
Oh, I don't mind for myself.
I don't mind not having anything to eat, not having anyplace to live, but the bitterest pill of all is not being able to afford you with us anymore.
Oh, what the hen feathers.
That's nothing to cry about.
Look, I'll just hightail it right on back to Bent Fork.
Well, maybe that would be best, Ernie.
Well, I'll go pack my other shirt.
Mama always said I had a lot of get-up-and-go, so I'll just get up and go.
Lucy?
Yeah?
Hi.
Hasn't he gone yet?
Sure.
He left an hour ago with his suitcase in his hand, his hat on his head and a lump in his throat.
Why are you still in those clothes?
Oh, I just wanted Ricky to see how I look.
: Oh.
Well, then you won't need our rollaway bed anymore.
No, I won't, Fred.
Thank you very much.
Let's get it out of her way.
Yeah.
I'd appreciate it.
It's a might handy thing to have around, though, I can tell you that.
Here we go.
Okay.
Ernie!
Yep, it's me.
Cousin Fred, you might as well put that runaway bed back where you got it.
I'm a-stayin'.
But, Ernie, I told you, we're broke.
They're wiped out.
I know it.
That's why I'm a-stayin'.
Cousin Lucy, I ain't a-leavin' you in your time of need.
I got as fer as the corner and I stopped dead in my tracks.
It hit me like a Hickory Ball.
I said to myself "You're a rat a- leavin' a sinking ship.
" Oh, now, Ernie, you shouldn't feel like that.
You just go on home.
We'll manage.
Sure.
We'll help 'em.
You can keep the apartment for another month.
You can go ahead home.
Yeah.
Now you all hush up.
I stayed with you while you was eatin' high on the hog and I'm gonna stick to you while you're down around the hocks.
Oh, Ernie, really, if I could Hi.
Hi, Rick.
Hi, Cousin!
Hi, amigo.
What's the matter with you?
Uh, I-I-I was just telling Ernie how we were broke and we couldn't afford to keep him here any longer and-and the reason that we were What do you mean, "broke"?
Now, don't you go puttin' on none for me there, Cousin Ricky.
Cousin Lucy told me all about you losing your j-o-b.
What?
!
That's right.
And-and now's when you need a real friend, and I ain't the only friend you've got neither.
What do you mean, Ernie?
Well, so on the way back up here, I stopped down at the grocery store, and the fella there was that amazed when I told him you'd been picked cleaner than a hound's tooth.
You told the grocery man that we were broke?
Yep, and look what he give me.
Oh, scoot over there.
This is just gonna tickle you to death.
Oh, I'll tell you, he's the nicest fella.
Here, now, there's some day-old bread.
Here's some of the canned goods that, uh, that lost the labels off them, you know.
Uh Ernie, the Ricardos don't, uh They don't want anybody to know they're broke.
Aah!
I never took no stock in foolish pride.
Now, down home, when folks got into trouble, the neighbors all pitched in and helped, and I'm happy to report that your neighbors here in New York are just as friendly as they are in Tennessee.
Why do you say that, Ernie?
I took up a collection of all your neighbors here in this apartment.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
And look-it here.
We didn't do bad, neither.
Look-it there.
Isn't that wonderful?
You know, when folks get hard up, it's just wonderful how people Hi.
Hi.
How'd everything go?
All right.
How's the baby?
Haven't heard a peep out of him.
Ricky come back yet?
No.
I have never seen him so mad.
Neither have I. He just started to shake and walked out of the door.
He didn't say a word to you, I wonder why.
He was afraid.
Afraid of what?
Afraid he might kill me.
Where's Ernie?
I don't know.
He just said, "I got an idea," and left.
Well, everybody took their money back and I got 42 cents left over.
Ah!
I'll bet that belonged to Ernie.
That's all the money he had left in the world.
Aw Oh, dear.
If I wasn't so sick and tired of him, I- I'd like him.
Well, how are you gonna get rid of him now?
I'm not even gonna try.
I give up.
Oh, Lucy, he'll stay here forever.
Well, we'll get used to him through the years.
Who knows?
Someday we may even adopt him.
: Oh I got to go put my roast on.
If you need any help when Ricky comes, just yell.
All right, dear.
: Here comes Ricky.
Hi.
Hi, Ethel.
Is that a smile?
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, you know, I got to thinking about it, and  I just can't get mad at that guy.
That's right, honey.
Sure.
He is so sweet and so nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Imagine him taking up a collection for us.
How about that?
Well, honey, I guess we'll just have to figure out a way to get rid of him without hurting his feelings.
That's right, honey.
I just can't do it.
No.
Cousin Lucy!
Cousin Lucy!
Here comes my oldest boy.
Cousin Lucy, your troubles is all over.
We'uns is a-going on Millikan's Chicken-Mash Hour.
Who is "we'uns"?
Well, me and you and Cousin Ricky and Cousin Ethel and Cousin Fred.
Now, wait.
Just, just count me'uns out of you all's we'uns.
Well, now, don't say the preserves is spoilt till you've took the lid off the jar.
What's he mean by that?
I don't know, but keep the lid on that jar.
But can't you see that this fixes everything?
They'll pay $200 for one appearance of Ernest Ford and his four hot chicken pickers.
"Hot chicken pickers"?
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no.
Look, Ernie, Ernie.
Really, we don't need the money.
Really, we don't.
Now, as the whale said when he seen Jonah standing on the bank, "I ain't a-swallerin' that.
" Look, Ernie, that's It's, it's, it's very nice of you, but we-we ain't the, uh, hot chicken pickin' type.
Then I guess I'll never get back to Bent Fork.
Why not?
Well, you see, with that $200, that'll pay my bus fare back to Bent Fork.
Then I'll have about 175 left and that ought to do you all about, oh, six months or so.
But if you don't cotton to the idea, I reckon I'll just have to set around here till I think of something better.
Ernie Hmm?
You mean if we, if we go on this television show with you, you you'll be able to go back to Bent Fork?
Right after the last twang of the guitar, I'll be a-headin' home quicker than a bobcat with a burr under his tail.
Ricky, what do you say?
Bring on the hot chickens and let's start pickin'.
And now, friends and neighbors, Millikan's Chicken-Mash Hour is proud to present for the first time on television, a group that come clean from Bent Fork, Tennessee, Ernie Ford and his four hot chicken pickers!

{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
Well, the baby's sound asleep.
I'll get Mrs. Trumbull.
We can go to the movies.
Where are the fellas?
Out in the hall.
Playing golf again?
Yeah.
They're practicing chip shots, whatever they are.
Oh, dear.
I was hoping we could get out of here before they started that.
Golf, golf, golf- that's all they think about anymore.
It's all your fault.
My fault?
Yes.
If you hadn't gotten those clubs for Ricky for his anniversary present, they never would have taken it up.
You're right.
I wanted to find him a hobby.
If I'd known this was gonna happen, I'd have gotten him an embroidery set.
Well, I'll put an end to this.
Fellas!
Oh!
Watch out what you're doing!
Oh, I'm sorry.
What are you trying to do?
It's only a Ping-Pong ball.
Well, come on now, we're gonna go to the movies.
Well, it'd better be a good picture.
Marriage certainly does strange things to a man.
This is the same man who used to say, "Who cares about the picture?
Let's just sit in the balcony and smooch.
" Never mind.
I know just how you feel, Lucy.
Oh, now, Ethel.
It's true, Fred.
It's been years since we sat in a movie with your arm around my waist.
It's been years since my arm reached around your waist.
Oh Well, let's face it, Ethel.
We're not exciting anymore.
Golf is.
Ah, Honey, it's not that.
It's that we're playing in our first tournament this week.
Yeah.
National Golf Day.
And we just want to be good, that's all.
Yeah, well, right now we're going to the movies.
Now, put those clubs away.
All right.
Rick, tomorrow I'll start working on that back-with- the-right-hip-first thing.
Yeah what do you mean right hip first?
Left hip.
How can you start back with the left hip when it's way around here?
Oh, now, look, Fred.
Come here, would you?
I'll watch.
Look.
I'll watch.
Now, address the ball, right?
Yes.
Now your weight is divided evenly, right?
Yes.
All right, go back now.
Ricky.
Fred.
See?
Ricky!
Fred!
Now, there's the Now, just a minute.
Will you relax?
This is very important.
That's it.
Gin.
Oh What's the score?
Yeah, I got it now.
You got it?
I know what you mean now.
All right.
Honestly, this is disgraceful.
Gee, it's too bad.
It was such a good picture, too.
You know, we're gonna have to do something about this golf business.
What do you have in mind?
Well, we could fight hobby with hobby.
We could get interested in something and drive them crazy.
Good.
Now, what'll it be?
How about men?
I mean a game we can play.
Something we can talk about all the time and practice around the house.
Let's see, tennis bowling swimming?
Catch on to your putting grip, see?
Well, I don't think that the grip   What Foul, foul, foul!
What is this?
!
It's our new hobby, basketball.
Jump ball.
All right.
Right over here.
Oh, no, you don't!
Now, wait a minute.
Now, just a minute.
If you don't mind, would you tell me what's going on here?
Uh well, we decided to take up a sport.
Yeah, you know one to occupy all our time.
One that we can practice all day and talk about all night.
Until everybody's bored to tears.
Well, I think that that is a splendid idea.
Now that you have your own sport, you will realize why we like golf so much.
That makes it work out perfectly.
Sure.
Now, let's go over to your apartment and practice that putting that you were talking about.
All right.
So long, bloomer girls.
Time-in!
Well, the game's over and we lost.
Should we turn in our suits and go to the showers?
I guess so.
Well, maybe we should have taken up golf.
At least we'd get to see them once in a while.
Yeah.
Hey, why not?
Why not what?
Why not take up golf?
Fred and Ricky are just starting to play.
They won't mind us being beginners, too.
Oh, Ethel, I don't know.
Oh, now, it's just perfect.
There're two of us and two of them.
We'll make a a foursome.
I have an idea this is one time that two and two will not make four.
Oh, now, Lucy, I've heard them say dozens of times how hard it is to get up a foursome.
Gee, that's right.
We'd really be doing them a favor.
Sure we would.
All right, I'll go tell them the good news.
All right.
Yeah?
Lucy.
Yeah?
Where's my golf book?
On-on the mantle.
Oh, thank you.
Here, Fred.
Uh, we We have something Oh?
to tell you.
Something that's going to surprise you, please you.
Yeah.
We're going to give up basketball.
Oh.
Here's the rule, Fred.
We're going to take up golf.
Isn't that wonderful?
Now you won't have any trouble getting up a foursome.
Well, uh, uh, uh you-you-you can't play golf with us.
No.
Why not?
Well, uh Why not, Fred?
It's against the law?
It is not.
Well, uh, uh Mamie doesn't play.
Oh Then it's all settled.
We're gonna play golf.
Yeah, and you and Fred can teach us.
That way, we can play and learn at the same time.
Won't that be fun?
Hey, Rick, that's a pretty good-looking swing.
Oh, I can hit little pieces of cellophane and dandelions all day long.
You put a ball in front of me, that's when I freeze up.
You'll get  Where are the girls?
Oh, you know how they are.
Takes them a long time to change clothes.
They're only changing shoes.
Yeah, you know something?
We might have made a terrible mistake, teaching our wives how to play golf.
Oh, everything will work out all right, you know.
They'll, they'll play with us for a couple of days.
They won't be any good and they'll, they'll get discouraged and they'll quit.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, supposing they don't get discouraged?
Supposing they like it real well and get good at it?
Then what are we gonna do?
Then we'll kill ourselves.
I'm with you.
Hey, you know, maybe you're right.
Yeah.
Maybe they will like it.
Uh-huh.
Maybe they won't want to quit.
Uh-huh.
We got to protect ourselves.
But how?
Well, they don't know anything about this game, do they?
I don't think so.
Anything that we tell them, they'll believe, right?
I think so.
Well, suppose that we make up a game that is so complicated and so confusing that they'll want to quit?
We can make up our own rules.
: There's an idea!
: I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
All right.
Here they come.
Now, look.
Just-just go along with whatever I do and say, and if you think of something good, throw it in.
I'm with you.
Okay.
Hi!
Hi, kids!
Hiya.
Hiya.
Gee, is it beautiful out here.
Isn't it nice?
No wonder you want to play golf all the time.
Oh, the air smells so fresh and so clean out here, I'm gonna like golf.
Gee, I'm gonna make a baby- sitting deal with Mrs. Trumbull, then we can play every day.
Sure!
Well, let's get started.
Uh, yeah.
Put your clubs right on there, honey.
Okay.
Get ready now.
Put them right on that bench, Ethel.
That's right.
Are you ready, everybody?
Yeah.
Fred?
Lucy.
What's this for?
Ethel.
To see who goes first.
Oh.
Well, Lucy goes first.
How do you figure that?
Uh the fourth one down from the top goes first.
Oh.
That's right.
Well, well, what club do I use?
What are you saying?
What club do I use?
What club?
Uh let me see now.
What club?
Um Uh I think a stymie would be right, don't you, Fred?
Yeah, unless she wants to use a niblick.
A niblick.
That sounds like something you made up.
Huh.
I'll use a stymie, dear.
Good.
Good.
Which one is it?
Uh that's a stymie right there.
Okay.
Now don't get		Uh-huh.
in their way.
Give her plenty of room now.
Give her plenty of room.
All right.
Where's the ball?
Oh, honey honey, if you don't know how to hold the club, why didn't you ask me?
Oh, well, I That's what we're here for- to teach you.
Well, I didn't want to appear too ignorant.
Oh, that's all right, honey.
You'll be doing all right.
Now, look, I'll show you.
See, put your club right here, like this.
Now get your hands here.
Now, interlock all your fingers like that, see?
Now, fold your thumbs under.
Now, go ahead and grip the club.
That's right.
Huh?
Ninth grip, yes.
Feels kind of uncomfortable.
You sure it's right?
Well, it's uncomfortable for everybody at first, but you'll get used to it.
Sure, yeah.
Okay, where's the ball?
Oh, yes, I'll get your ball.
Here.
Oh, Fred, I don't have any divots.
Have you got a divot with you?
Oh, is that what a divot is?
That's a divot, yeah.
Oh.
Now, there you go.
There.
Like so.
Now, go ahead.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
What's the matter?
She forgot to say "May I"?
Oh.
I didn't know.
Well, now, look, honey, as long as you're going to play the game, you might as well learn it correctly from the very beginning.
Yeah, I want to learn the right way.
All right, now, when you forget to say "may I", before you hit the ball, it's a penalty.
Oh.
You lose ten points and you have to take one giant step forward with your right leg only.
One giant step forward, right-right leg only.
Right.
Now hit the ball.
Very good!
Was that good?
That's her first time out.
She'll be a champion.
Oh, really?
Go ahead, hit it again, honey.
Hit it again.
Yes, sir.
Hit it again.
Oh, I got to get the grip.
Yeah.
Come on.
That's getting to look better.
One Now, don't look at the ball, honey.
Keep your eyes on the fairway.
Don't look at the ball.
Two.
That's good.
Three!
That's a dormie.
A dormie?
A dormie, yeah.
Now you get to pick up the ball and throw it down the fairway under your left leg.
Oh, that's a cinch.
Very good.
Oh, that's very good.
Now it's your turn, Ethel.
My turn.
My turn.
I'll get your club.
Okay.
All right.
I hope I'm as good as you were.
It's, it's not hard at all, really.
Here, I'll show you how I know how.
I watched her.
Oh, excuse me.
That's right, that's right.
She knows.
That's the grip, yeah.
Give me the ball.
Oh, yes, I forgot.
: There you are.
May I?
Yeah.
Be my guest.
Uh-uh-uh-uh, no, no, no, no, no.
What did I do?
Why, you can't do a normal stymie after your partner has dormied.
Oh, I can't?
What's the matter with you?
Are you trying to get us thrown off the golf course?
Well, I didn't know.
Ricky.
Yes, sir.
Permission to shoot out of turn, please.
Permission granted.
Thank you.
Let me show you how to make the shot.
What was that?
A birdie.
Oh!
A birdie.
Okay, a birdie.
Give me another ball.
All right.
Here you are.
Birdie.
I've heard about birdies.
Yeah, you heard about it.
That's right.
One, two, three Kick it, Ethel!
Kick it?
!
Kick the ball, yeah.
Four, five If he gets to ten, you're out.
Now kick it, kick it.
Oh, I kick it!
I kick it!
She kicked it!
Now it's your turn, Rick.
My turn?
Yes.
What are you talking about?
She kicked the ball before I counted to ten, so I don't get to drive in this hole.
Oh, that's right.
Now, let's see, uh Lucy shot first, and her ball went farther down the fairway than the third player's ball.
Yeah.
So, Lucy gets to carry all the bags!
That's right.
You mean I won?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, wonderful!
We'll see you down the fairway.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Ethel.
Hurry up, Lucy.
Hurry up, honey.
I am.
Hurry up now.
Yeah, I will.
Hurry up!
I'm hurrying.
They're doing fine, aren't they?
I should say they are.
Come on, girls, hurry up!
They approach very well.
I'll say they do.
That's it.
That's it.
Fine.
That's it.
That's it.
Oh, well, how did we do?
Well, it only took us one hour and a half to get to the first green.
Well, that ought to be some kind of a record.
I would say so, yeah, yeah.
Now what do we do?
Well, now we all putt our balls into the little cup here.
Yeah.
Oh?
Uh-oh!
What's the matter?
Lucy's ball is not on the green.
Oh, is that my ball?
Uh-uh-uh-uh!
Never, never, never touch your ball unless it's a dormie.
Oh, well, I didn't know.
Well, I'm sorry, but you get a mashie for a penalty.
What's a mashie?
This is a mashie.
That's a mashie?
That's a mashie, yeah.
Now we all putt our balls into the cup.
All right.
Now, here's your putter.
Here's your putter, Ethel.
Where's my ball?
There's your ball Right there.
in the corner.
Place the flag down here.
Rick?
Yeah?
Do we all go at once?
Yeah, yeah, we all go at once.
Sure, that's the reason they say this game is so much like hockey.
That's right, yeah.
Now, you see, uh the idea of putting here is that you try to get your ball in the cup and at the same time, you try to keep the other players' ball from getting into the cup.
Okay.
Okay.
Now, I'll count to three and we all go.
All right.
Are you ready?
Yup.
One, two, three.
ETHEL : That's mine.
That's mine.
That's mine.
Hurry up.
I got mine in!
I got mine in!
Well, that's wonderful!
I told you she'd be a champ.
Yeah.
Do I win?
Yes, sir!
So you get to carry all the bags again.
We'll see you at the next tee.
Hurry up, now, Lucy.
Hurry up.
I won.
Come on, girl, come on.
Up in the air, up in the air.
That's enough.
Gee, that's some penalty just because I hit my ball farther than Fred did.
We told them we wanted to learn to play right.
What are you complaining about?
I had to carry the bags.
I wonder where the fellows are.
I haven't seen them since Fred hit his ball into the woods.
Well, how many strokes did you take on that hole?
Six.
Lucy.
Well, 26.
What's the difference?
How many did you take?
Thirty.
Yeah.
I'll just put down seven for each of us.
I wonder what the penalty is for that.
I think while I'm waiting, I'll practice that stroke Ricky was ready to teach me.
Which one?
You know, the one that you use when you're between 47 and 63 yards from the green.
The "hop, skip and a jump" shot.
This grip's beginning to feel a lot better.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
Uh, you mind if I go through?
Go through what?
Well, I was, uh, behind you and playing by myself and, uh Oh, you want to join us.
Oh, sure.
I'm Lucy Ricardo and this is Ethel Mertz.
What's your name?
I'm Jimmy Demaret.
Jimmy Demaret?
!
Oh, for heaven's sake, we've heard so much about you.
Listen, we're just, ju-just learning.
You sure you won't mind playing with us?
Oh, uh, not at all.
Oh, well, fine, then.
Let's get started.
Let's see who goes first.
Oh, uh, ladies always first.
Oh, no, no.
We have to choose up.
Here you are, Jim.
Come on.
You go first, Jim.
You're second from the top.
Uh-uh-uh.
You didn't say, "May I"?
"May I"?
Too late now.
That'll cost you ten points.
Yeah, with all of your experience, I'm surprised at you.
Well, go ahead.
Well, that was pretty dull.
What was that?
Stand there and hit the ball- anybody could do that.
I thought at least you were gonna use an over-the-shoulder, left-handed whirling stymie, didn't you?
Well Hey you lost another ten points.
Your ball missed the sand trap completely and landed right on the green.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, better luck next time.
You show him how to do it, Lucy.
Okay.
Dormie!
Dormie!
Dormie!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, dormie, dormie.
Boy, you're getting good.
Okay.
Don't you think she's wonderful?
She just learned how to play today.
Ladies, are you sure you're playing golf?
Sure.
Well, who taught you to play like that?
Our husbands taught us.
Yeah.
You mean this "choose upside" and "may I" and "hop, skip and a jump" business?
Yeah.
Isn't that the way you play?
Well, uh not exactly.
Well, for heaven's sake.
There's a rotten Cuban in Denmark.
And he's got a fat friend.
What a dirty trick.
Would I like to get even with them.
Oh, I can see us playing leapfrog up there.
No wonder they No wonder Oh A hundred people watching us!
Oh, Lucy.
I know how we can get even with them.
They're in that big tournament tomorrow.
That's our big chance.
Yeah?
Jimmy, will you help us?
May I?
You certainly may.
Here's what we Ladies and gentlemen, the next threesome on the tee will be amateurs Ricky Ricardo and Fred Mertz of New York City, and from the Concord Hotel at Lake Kiamesha, New York, three times winner of the Masters at Augusta, Georgia, Jimmy Demaret.
Did you hear who we're playing with?
Boy, did I- Jimmy Demaret.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
I won't be able to play at all in front of him.
Oh, he'll know we're just beginners.
He had to start himself, you know.
No need in being nervous.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I just hope I remember the rules after that silly game we played with the wives.
Yeah.
That was kind of nasty, wasn't it?
Now, don't knock it.
At least we got rid of them.
Yeah.
Isn't that Jimmy Demaret?
Yeah.
Oh, please, please.
Just let me hit the ball.
I don't care where it goes.
Just let me hit it.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Demaret.
I'm Ricky Ricardo, and this is Fred Mertz.
Nice to see you both.
Hi, Jimmy.
Sure.
A great pleasure and an honor playing with you, sir.
Well, it's my pleasure.
Thank you.
Our caddies are not here yet.
They said that there was some, uh something A couple of caddies got sick and they had to replace them.
I think these are your caddies coming here now.
Oh, I see.
What are you doing here?
What is this?
We're your caddies.
Yup.
Well, are you all ready?
Shall we go?
Yup.
Step aside, bud.
Got to pick Mr. Ricardo's club.
Yeah, this is the one, bub.
If you don't mind, I'll use this.
Now, Lucy, I don't know what you're doing, but whatever it is, do it later.
You know who we're playing with?
Who?
Jimmy Demaret.
Jimmy Demaret?
!
Who's he?
Just a minute, chum.
Better tell you how to play this hole.
Think you ought to use the old hop, skip and a jump, huh?
No.
I think you ought to take three giant steps and kick the bogie.
Ethel, come back here.
Mashie!
He touched it.
Mashie!
You crazy or something?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mr. Demaret.
: I-I-I It's It's some kind of a joke or something.
I assure you, it will never happen again.
That's all right.
That's all right.
Will it, dear?
Eh.
May I?
Yay!
Attaboy, Jimmy!
Why, Jimmy, you were in it all the time.
He was in it all the time.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 29}
Well, the baby's sound asleep.
I'll get Mrs. Trumbull.
We can go to the movies.
Where are the fellas?
Out in the hall.
Playing golf again?
Yeah.
They're practicing chip shots, whatever they are.
Oh, dear.
I was hoping we could get out of here before they started that.
Golf, golf, golf- that's all they think about anymore.
It's all your fault.
My fault?
Yes.
If you hadn't gotten those clubs for Ricky for his anniversary present, they never would have taken it up.
You're right.
I wanted to find him a hobby.
If I'd known this was gonna happen, I'd have gotten him an embroidery set.
Well, I'll put an end to this.
Fellas!
Oh!
Watch out what you're doing!
Oh, I'm sorry.
What are you trying to do?
It's only a Ping-Pong ball.
Well, come on now, we're gonna go to the movies.
Well, it'd better be a good picture.
Marriage certainly does strange things to a man.
This is the same man who used to say, "Who cares about the picture?
Let's just sit in the balcony and smooch.
" Never mind.
I know just how you feel, Lucy.
Oh, now, Ethel.
It's true, Fred.
It's been years since we sat in a movie with your arm around my waist.
It's been years since my arm reached around your waist.
Oh Well, let's face it, Ethel.
We're not exciting anymore.
Golf is.
Ah, Honey, it's not that.
It's that we're playing in our first tournament this week.
Yeah.
National Golf Day.
And we just want to be good, that's all.
Yeah, well, right now we're going to the movies.
Now, put those clubs away.
All right.
Rick, tomorrow I'll start working on that back-with- the-right-hip-first thing.
Yeah what do you mean right hip first?
Left hip.
How can you start back with the left hip when it's way around here?
Oh, now, look, Fred.
Come here, would you?
I'll watch.
Look.
I'll watch.
Now, address the ball, right?
Yes.
Now your weight is divided evenly, right?
Yes.
All right, go back now.
Ricky.
Fred.
See?
Ricky!
Fred!
Now, there's the Now, just a minute.
Will you relax?
This is very important.
That's it.
Gin.
Oh What's the score?
Yeah, I got it now.
You got it?
I know what you mean now.
All right.
Honestly, this is disgraceful.
Gee, it's too bad.
It was such a good picture, too.
You know, we're gonna have to do something about this golf business.
What do you have in mind?
Well, we could fight hobby with hobby.
We could get interested in something and drive them crazy.
Good.
Now, what'll it be?
How about men?
I mean a game we can play.
Something we can talk about all the time and practice around the house.
Let's see, tennis bowling swimming?
Catch on to your putting grip, see?
Well, I don't think that the grip   What Foul, foul, foul!
What is this?
!
It's our new hobby, basketball.
Jump ball.
All right.
Right over here.
Oh, no, you don't!
Now, wait a minute.
Now, just a minute.
If you don't mind, would you tell me what's going on here?
Uh well, we decided to take up a sport.
Yeah, you know one to occupy all our time.
One that we can practice all day and talk about all night.
Until everybody's bored to tears.
Well, I think that that is a splendid idea.
Now that you have your own sport, you will realize why we like golf so much.
That makes it work out perfectly.
Sure.
Now, let's go over to your apartment and practice that putting that you were talking about.
All right.
So long, bloomer girls.
Time-in!
Well, the game's over and we lost.
Should we turn in our suits and go to the showers?
I guess so.
Well, maybe we should have taken up golf.
At least we'd get to see them once in a while.
Yeah.
Hey, why not?
Why not what?
Why not take up golf?
Fred and Ricky are just starting to play.
They won't mind us being beginners, too.
Oh, Ethel, I don't know.
Oh, now, it's just perfect.
There're two of us and two of them.
We'll make a a foursome.
I have an idea this is one time that two and two will not make four.
Oh, now, Lucy, I've heard them say dozens of times how hard it is to get up a foursome.
Gee, that's right.
We'd really be doing them a favor.
Sure we would.
All right, I'll go tell them the good news.
All right.
Yeah?
Lucy.
Yeah?
Where's my golf book?
On-on the mantle.
Oh, thank you.
Here, Fred.
Uh, we We have something Oh?
to tell you.
Something that's going to surprise you, please you.
Yeah.
We're going to give up basketball.
Oh.
Here's the rule, Fred.
We're going to take up golf.
Isn't that wonderful?
Now you won't have any trouble getting up a foursome.
Well, uh, uh, uh you-you-you can't play golf with us.
No.
Why not?
Well, uh Why not, Fred?
It's against the law?
It is not.
Well, uh, uh Mamie doesn't play.
Oh Then it's all settled.
We're gonna play golf.
Yeah, and you and Fred can teach us.
That way, we can play and learn at the same time.
Won't that be fun?
Hey, Rick, that's a pretty good-looking swing.
Oh, I can hit little pieces of cellophane and dandelions all day long.
You put a ball in front of me, that's when I freeze up.
You'll get  Where are the girls?
Oh, you know how they are.
Takes them a long time to change clothes.
They're only changing shoes.
Yeah, you know something?
We might have made a terrible mistake, teaching our wives how to play golf.
Oh, everything will work out all right, you know.
They'll, they'll play with us for a couple of days.
They won't be any good and they'll, they'll get discouraged and they'll quit.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, supposing they don't get discouraged?
Supposing they like it real well and get good at it?
Then what are we gonna do?
Then we'll kill ourselves.
I'm with you.
Hey, you know, maybe you're right.
Yeah.
Maybe they will like it.
Uh-huh.
Maybe they won't want to quit.
Uh-huh.
We got to protect ourselves.
But how?
Well, they don't know anything about this game, do they?
I don't think so.
Anything that we tell them, they'll believe, right?
I think so.
Well, suppose that we make up a game that is so complicated and so confusing that they'll want to quit?
We can make up our own rules.
: There's an idea!
: I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
All right.
Here they come.
Now, look.
Just-just go along with whatever I do and say, and if you think of something good, throw it in.
I'm with you.
Okay.
Hi!
Hi, kids!
Hiya.
Hiya.
Gee, is it beautiful out here.
Isn't it nice?
No wonder you want to play golf all the time.
Oh, the air smells so fresh and so clean out here, I'm gonna like golf.
Gee, I'm gonna make a baby- sitting deal with Mrs. Trumbull, then we can play every day.
Sure!
Well, let's get started.
Uh, yeah.
Put your clubs right on there, honey.
Okay.
Get ready now.
Put them right on that bench, Ethel.
That's right.
Are you ready, everybody?

What club?
Um Uh I think a stymie would be right, don't you, Fred?
Yeah, unless she wants to use a niblick.
A niblick.
That sounds like something you made up.
Huh.
I'll use a stymie, dear.
Good.

See, put your club right here, like this.
Now get your hands here.
Now, interlock all your fingers like that, see?
Now, fold your thumbs under.
Now, go ahead and grip the club.
That's right.
Huh?
Ninth grip, yes.
Feels kind of uncomfortable.
You sure it's right?
Well, it's uncomfortable for everybody at first, but you'll get used to it.
Sure, yeah.
Okay, where's the ball?
Oh, yes, I'll get your ball.
Here.
Oh, Fred, I don't have any divots.
Have you got a divot with you?
Oh, is that what a divot is?
That's a divot, yeah.
Oh.
Now, there you go.
There.
Like so.
Now, go ahead.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
What's the matter?
She forgot to say "May I"?
Oh.
I didn't know.
Well, now, look, honey, as long as you're going to play the game, you might as well learn it correctly from the very beginning.
Yeah, I want to learn the right way.

Now you get to pick up the ball and throw it down the fairway under your left leg.
Oh, that's a cinch.
Very good.
Oh, that's very good.
Now it's your turn, Ethel.
My turn.
My turn.
I'll get your club.
Okay.
All right.
I hope I'm as good as you were.
It's, it's not hard at all, really.
Here, I'll show you how I know how.
I watched her.
Oh, excuse me.
That's right, that's right.
She knows.
That's the grip, yeah.
Give me the ball.
Oh, yes, I forgot.
: There you are.
May I?
Yeah.
Be my guest.
Uh-uh-uh-uh, no, no, no, no, no.
What did I do?
Why, you can't do a normal stymie after your partner has dormied.
Oh, I can't?
What's the matter with you?
Are you trying to get us thrown off the golf course?
Well, I didn't know.
Ricky.
Yes, sir.
Permission to shoot out of turn, please.
Permission granted.
Thank you.
Let me show you how to make the shot.
What was that?
A birdie.
Oh!
A birdie.
Okay, a birdie.
Give me another ball.
All right.
Here you are.
Birdie.
I've heard about birdies.
Yeah, you heard about it.
That's right.
One, two, three Kick it, Ethel!
Kick it?
!
Kick the ball, yeah.
Four, five If he gets to ten, you're out.
Now kick it, kick it.
Oh, I kick it!
I kick it!
She kicked it!
Now it's your turn, Rick.
My turn?
Yes.
What are you talking about?
She kicked the ball before I counted to ten, so I don't get to drive in this hole.
Oh, that's right.
Now, let's see, uh Lucy shot first, and her ball went farther down the fairway than the third player's ball.
Yeah.
So, Lucy gets to carry all the bags!
That's right.
You mean I won?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, wonderful!
We'll see you down the fairway.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Ethel.
Hurry up, Lucy.
Hurry up, honey.
I am.
Hurry up now.
Yeah, I will.
Hurry up!
I'm hurrying.
They're doing fine, aren't they?
I should say they are.
Come on, girls, hurry up!
They approach very well.
I'll say they do.
That's it.
That's it.
Fine.
That's it.
That's it.
Oh, well, how did we do?
Well, it only took us one hour and a half to get to the first green.
Well, that ought to be some kind of a record.
I would say so, yeah, yeah.
Now what do we do?
Well, now we all putt our balls into the little cup here.
Yeah.
Oh?
Uh-oh!
What's the matter?
Lucy's ball is not on the green.
Oh, is that my ball?
Uh-uh-uh-uh!
Never, never, never touch your ball unless it's a dormie.
Oh, well, I didn't know.
Well, I'm sorry, but you get a mashie for a penalty.
What's a mashie?
This is a mashie.
That's a mashie?
That's a mashie, yeah.
Now we all putt our balls into the cup.
All right.
Now, here's your putter.
Here's your putter, Ethel.
Where's my ball?
There's your ball Right there.
in the corner.
Place the flag down here.
Rick?
Yeah?
Do we all go at once?
Yeah, yeah, we all go at once.
Sure, that's the reason they say this game is so much like hockey.
That's right, yeah.
Now, you see, uh the idea of putting here is that you try to get your ball in the cup and at the same time, you try to keep the other players' ball from getting into the cup.
Okay.
Okay.
Now, I'll count to three and we all go.
All right.
Are you ready?
Yup.
One, two, three.
ETHEL : That's mine.
That's mine.
That's mine.
Hurry up.
I got mine in!
I got mine in!
Well, that's wonderful!
I told you she'd be a champ.
Yeah.
Do I win?
Yes, sir!
So you get to carry all the bags again.
We'll see you at the next tee.
Hurry up, now, Lucy.
Hurry up.
I won.
Come on, girl, come on.
Up in the air, up in the air.
That's enough.
Gee, that's some penalty just because I hit my ball farther than Fred did.
We told them we wanted to learn to play right.
What are you complaining about?
I had to carry the bags.
I wonder where the fellows are.
I haven't seen them since Fred hit his ball into the woods.
Well, how many strokes did you take on that hole?
Six.
Lucy.
Well, 26.
What's the difference?
How many did you take?
Thirty.
Yeah.
I'll just put down seven for each of us.
I wonder what the penalty is for that.
I think while I'm waiting, I'll practice that stroke Ricky was ready to teach me.
Which one?
You know, the one that you use when you're between 47 and 63 yards from the green.
The "hop, skip and a jump" shot.
This grip's beginning to feel a lot better.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
Uh, you mind if I go through?
Go through what?
Well, I was, uh, behind you and playing by myself and, uh Oh, you want to join us.
Oh, sure.
I'm Lucy Ricardo and this is Ethel Mertz.
What's your name?
I'm Jimmy Demaret.
Jimmy Demaret?
!
Oh, for heaven's sake, we've heard so much about you.
Listen, we're just, ju-just learning.
You sure you won't mind playing with us?
Oh, uh, not at all.
Oh, well, fine, then.
Let's get started.
Let's see who goes first.
Oh, uh, ladies always first.
Oh, no, no.
We have to choose up.
Here you are, Jim.
Come on.
You go first, Jim.
You're second from the top.
Uh-uh-uh.
You didn't say, "May I"?
"May I"?
Too late now.
That'll cost you ten points.
Yeah, with all of your experience, I'm surprised at you.
Well, go ahead.
Well, that was pretty dull.
What was that?
Stand there and hit the ball- anybody could do that.
I thought at least you were gonna use an over-the-shoulder, left-handed whirling stymie, didn't you?
Well Hey you lost another ten points.
Your ball missed the sand trap completely and landed right on the green.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, better luck next time.
You show him how to do it, Lucy.
Okay.
Dormie!
Dormie!
Dormie!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, dormie, dormie.
Boy, you're getting good.
Okay.
Don't you think she's wonderful?
She just learned how to play today.
Ladies, are you sure you're playing golf?
Sure.
Well, who taught you to play like that?
Our husbands taught us.
Yeah.
You mean this "choose upside" and "may I" and "hop, skip and a jump" business?
Yeah.
Isn't that the way you play?
Well, uh not exactly.
Well, for heaven's sake.
There's a rotten Cuban in Denmark.
And he's got a fat friend.
What a dirty trick.
Would I like to get even with them.
Oh, I can see us playing leapfrog up there.
No wonder they No wonder Oh A hundred people watching us!
Oh, Lucy.
I know how we can get even with them.
They're in that big tournament tomorrow.
That's our big chance.
Yeah?
Jimmy, will you help us?
May I?
You certainly may.
Here's what we Ladies and gentlemen, the next threesome on the tee will be amateurs Ricky Ricardo and Fred Mertz of New York City, and from the Concord Hotel at Lake Kiamesha, New York, three times winner of the Masters at Augusta, Georgia, Jimmy Demaret.
Did you hear who we're playing with?
Boy, did I- Jimmy Demaret.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
I won't be able to play at all in front of him.
Oh, he'll know we're just beginners.
He had to start himself, you know.
No need in being nervous.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I just hope I remember the rules after that silly game we played with the wives.
Yeah.
That was kind of nasty, wasn't it?
Now, don't knock it.
At least we got rid of them.
Yeah.
Isn't that Jimmy Demaret?
Yeah.
Oh, please, please.
Just let me hit the ball.
I don't care where it goes.
Just let me hit it.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Demaret.
I'm Ricky Ricardo, and this is Fred Mertz.
Nice to see you both.
Hi, Jimmy.
Sure.
A great pleasure and an honor playing with you, sir.
Well, it's my pleasure.
Thank you.
Our caddies are not here yet.
They said that there was some, uh something A couple of caddies got sick and they had to replace them.
I think these are your caddies coming here now.
Oh, I see.
What are you doing here?
What is this?
We're your caddies.
Yup.
Well, are you all ready?
Shall we go?
Yup.
Step aside, bud.
Got to pick Mr. Ricardo's club.
Yeah, this is the one, bub.
If you don't mind, I'll use this.
Now, Lucy, I don't know what you're doing, but whatever it is, do it later.
You know who we're playing with?
Who?
Jimmy Demaret.
Jimmy Demaret?
!
Who's he?
Just a minute, chum.
Better tell you how to play this hole.
Think you ought to use the old hop, skip and a jump, huh?
No.
I think you ought to take three giant steps and kick the bogie.
Ethel, come back here.
Mashie!
He touched it.
Mashie!
You crazy or something?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mr. Demaret.
: I-I-I It's It's some kind of a joke or something.
I assure you, it will never happen again.
That's all right.
That's all right.
Will it, dear?
Eh.
May I?
Yay!
Attaboy, Jimmy!
Why, Jimmy, you were in it all the time.
He was in it all the time.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
Honey, did you call the Mertzes?
Yeah.
They said they'd be right over.
Good.
Well, there they are.
Wait till you tell them.
Hi.
Hi!
What did you want to see us about?
Yeah.
What's going on?
We have a big surprise for you.
Tell them, honey.
Ricky's band has been booked into a big, beautiful summer resort in Maine for two whole months.
Won't that be a wonderful vacation?
Oh, boy!
Are you and the baby going, too?
Sure.
Yeah.
Oh, gee, it must be great to leave this hot city in the middle of summer and go to a place like that.
Two whole months.
Isn't that sheer heaven?
Boy, what a deal.
Isn't that really great?
Oh, I don't know what I'll do with you gone for two months.
Oh Well, at least the kitchen door and your tongue will both get a little rest.
Oh, Fred, now, Fred Gee, I hope the baby doesn't forget us.
Oh, Ethel, don't be silly.
Well, they forget awful fast, you know.
Well, not in that length of time.
Just think- you've lived here 12 years.
This is the first time we've ever really been separated.
That's right.
Yeah, it'll be a little lonesome around here all right.
What are you talking about?
You coming up to visit us.
Huh?
Why, certainly.
You don't think we were gonna stand being away from our very best friends for two whole months, do you?
No, sir.
You coming up as our guests.
Oh, Ricky, I don't think we could Now, you're coming up or we're not going.
That's right.
Honestly, you're just about the nicest, most unselfish people I've ever known.
Well, why shouldn't we be nice to two of the sweetest, most wonderful people in the whole world?
Aw Fred, do you ever have the feeling that you were sitting in the middle of a hot fudge sundae?
Ha, ha, ha!
Yeah.
They're pretty sticky, aren't they?
Well, you can laugh if you want to, but it's gonna seem awful strange having this apartment empty all summer.
Well, we got another surprise for you.
Yup!
This apartment is not going to be empty all summer.
It isn't?
No.
Yes, sir.
I think that we're gonna be able to sublet it.
Well, good.
Oh, Rick, that's fine.
You know, I started thinking about it, I said, "Gee, it's a pretty tough rap paying 125 bucks a month when we're not gonna be here for a couple of months.
Yeah, and I'd feel guilty taking it from you.
Well, I thought you would, Fred, so I went to see the real estate agent, you know, Mrs. Hammond, and she said she's sure she can rent it for us.
Well, that's great.
Fine.
Oh, boy, that's really great.
As a matter of fact, she said that she could get me $300 a month for it.
$300 a month!
Isn't that wonderful?
What's the matter?
Fred, what's the matter?
Well, you only pay us $125 a month rent.
Now, do you think it's fair for you to make money on our apartment?
Well, Fred, I thought you'd be happy that we could make a little money.
Yeah.
After all, we got a lease.
We're living up to our lease.
As long as you get $125 a month, it's fair.
Well, it might be fair, but it's lousy.
Now, wait a minute.
Don't make it look like we're wrong.
You're getting the best of the deal.
What?
!
What are you talking about?
Well, now, suppose that the boot was on the other hand.
How about that?
Suppose that-that I could only get $50 a month.
Would you give me $75 back?
Of course not.
There you are- our friends.
We're losing $75 a month, and they wouldn't help us that much.
Yeah.
Oh, now, just a minute.
This is an entirely different proposition.
Yeah!
Why?
Because you're getting $300 a month.
Yeah.
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way about it, old man, but I don't think there's anything you can do about it.
Oh, isn't there?
No, sir.
We have a lease.
The lease says that we have the right to sublet.
Honey, where is the lease?
Right here.
Thank you.
Pardon me, please.
Pardon me.
Here it is, dear.
Pardon me, please.
Thank you.
Here you are.
Think you're playing with kids?
Hmm!
Here it is.
"The lessee has the right to sublet the apartment in question " The lessee- that's us, and this is the apartment in question.
Ha-ha!
Read on.
Read on.
"The lessee has the right "to sublet the apartment in question with the with the approval of the lessor.
" And that's us- Mr. And Mrs. Fred Lessor.
Well, what do you say to that, Minnehaha?
Well, I don't see how that changes anything.
We-well, you certainly have to approve somebody we bring in here.
Oh, we will?
Oh, now, don't tell me that you're going to turn down everybody that we try to rent this apartment to, are you?
Well, honestly, what a couple of stinkers!
Oh, a few minutes ago, she said we were the sweetest, most wonderful people.
Yeah, let's get out of here, Ethel.
Okay.
Well, honey Have a nice time in Maine.
Have a nice, hot, sticky summer!
No matter how hot it gets, it'll be sheer heaven so long as you are not here.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Hammond.
Well, look, Mrs. Hammond, there's no use bringing anybody else over here to look at the apartment.
The Mertzes have turned down the last six couples.
Well, just a minute.
Mrs. Hammond, she wants to show the apartment again.
She said she has a very lovely couple.
Why bother?
The Mertzes wouldn't even approve Ike and Mamie.
Well, she said she's sure they'll approve these people.
Well, what have we got to lose?
Okay.
Bring them over, Mrs. Hammond.
Thanks.
Good-bye.
I wonder why she thinks they'll approve these people.
I don't know.
What's the difference?
We're leaving tonight anyway.
Yeah.
I'll get it, dear.
Oh, Mrs. Hammond!
How did you get here so soon?
Oh, I was in the neighborhood when I phoned.
Won't you come in?
What are you doing here?
Oh, we came over to see if we approve of the couple who are subletting the apartment.
Oh.
Where are they, Mrs. Hammond?
There they are.
What?
!
Fred, do you approve of me?
Yes.
Ethel, do you approve of me?
Yes.
We approve of us.
Well, really.
I don't get it.
Mrs. Hammond, what's going on here?
Well, I think that the Mertzes are going to sublease your apartment and sub-sublet it to someone else.
Oh, they're trying to make us look at this thing through a sweater.
Oh, you mean they're trying to pull the wool over our eyes?
Yeah.
Well, just forget the whole deal.
The the apartment will just stay empty for the whole summer.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Come on, Fred.
Good-bye.
Just a minute, please.
May I make a suggestion?
What?
Well, I've rented apartments in this building for my clients for a long time, and every time I've been here, I've been struck by the wonderful friendship between you two couples.
Well, you're just devoted to each other.
I'll bet you've been best friends for ten years.
Twelve.
Yeah.
Thirteen.
No, it's 12.
Well, now, the important thing is that I don't want to see it end, and I don't think you do either.
Now, look, here's the idea: You're paying $125 a month for the apartment, and I know that I can get you $300 a month, so why don't you let me find you a nice tenant, and you can split the profit between you?
Okay?
Okay, Fred?
Okay.
Oh!
Oh, I'm so glad.
I'm glad that's over.
Thank you, Mrs. Hammond.
Oh, this would have taken a lot longer without you.
Yeah.
I was just trying to protect my commission.
Good-bye.
See you.
Thank you, Mrs. Hammond.
Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye, Mrs. Hammond.
Thank you very much.
Bye.
Aw, wasn't that sweet of her?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, Rick, whatever gave you the idea that you two have been living here 13 years?
Yeah, it's only 12.
Yeah, it's only 12, dear.
Now, wait a minute.
We moved here when we got married, and we got married, Lucy was 22 years old.
How old are you now, honey?
Oh.
How do you like that?
We've only lived here six years.
Lucy, can I help you?
Oh.
No, I'm all finished.
Come on in.
I really only wanted to come over and talk anyway.
I'm so glad we made up.
So am I. Wasn't that silly?
It always is.
Yeah.
Oh, Mrs. Hammond, you're back already?
I rented your apartment.
No kidding!
Really, I did.
To a Mr. Beecher for $300.
$300!
Oh, $300 Sit down, dear.
Oh, that's great.
Wh-Where is he?
Well, I phoned him to meet me here.
In the meantime, I want to tell you something about him.
What's the matter with him?
Nothing, but he-he is really a shy, little man.
He was a witness on a murder trial.
He's been in court for months, and his nerves are all shot.
Oh Mm-hmm.
All he wants is a nice, quiet place where no one can find him, where he can rest and get control of his nerves.
Oh, well, he'll like it here.
Oh, yes.
Gee, this is fine.
Did you hear something?
Uh-uh.
Thought I heard a knock.
Yeah.
Maybe it's Mr. Beecher.
All right.
Mr. Beecher?
Mr. Beecher?
Mr. Beecher.
Oh, come on in.
This is the right place.
Now, this is Mrs. Ricardo and Mrs. Mertz and this is Mr. Beecher.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Mr. Beecher, I've told them that you want a nice, quiet place, and I'm sure that you'll find this just perfect.
I don't hear a thing.
Oh, no, it's nice and quiet.
Sometimes it's so quiet, I think everybody else in the apartment house is dead.
Uh, what she means, Mr. Beecher, is that this place is always quiet as a tomb.
Uh, wou-wouldn't you like me to show you around, Mr. Beecher?
Now, right through here, we have the kitchen.
Now, you see, it's, it's really a lovely, big kitchen, and there's always plenty of light.
Oh, yes, we get the sun here all day long.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, M-Mr. Beecher?
Mr. Beecher?
I'm sorry, sir.
It got away from me.
May I see the bedroom?
Oh, yes, sir.
Right, right in through there.
Yes, yes, I'll show you.
Come right this way with me, Mr. Beecher.
Right through here.
That's the way.
Come right along.
Did you ever see anyone in that condition?
Oh, they must have been awful rough on him at that murder trial.
Yeah.
I think he'll make a good tenant, though, huh?
Well, at least he won't give any wild parties.
Not very many anyway.
Mr. Beecher thinks it's perfect.
Oh, I'm so glad you like it, sir.
Now, Mrs. Ricardo, will you sign the lease?
Certainly.
Right there.
Right here?
Yes.
There.
Now, and Mr. Beecher, right under Mrs. Ricardo's signature, please.
Thank you.
Uh, Mr. Beecher, when would you like to move in?
As soon as possible.
Oh, well, uh, we're leaving tonight.
Uh, you can move in right away.
I'll take these bags down to the Mertzes'.
Yes, I'll help you.
Okay.
Oh, fine.
I'll get my things and move in right away.
Oh, that's fine.
I sure hope you're going to like it here, sir.
Oh, you will.
It's nice and quiet.
Yes.
Thank you, Mrs. Hammond.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Ethel, Mr. Beecher paid me the whole two months rent.
That's $600.
$175 profit for each of us.
Less Mrs. Hammond's commission, of course.
Oh, boy!
Where's the baby?
I thought you were gonna go get him.
Oh, Mrs. Trumbull wanted to keep him a while longer.
She can't bear to say good-bye to him for two whole months.
She's so sweet.
Yeah.
There's Ricky!
Ricky, come here!
I got something to tell you.
Well, I got something to tell you, too.
Oh, well, you go ahead.
My agent just got a wire from Maine.
The job fell through.
We're not going.
Ew Well, I'm awfully sorry, honey.
What do you have to tell me?
Eww!
What is it?
I just rented our apartment for the summer.
What?
!
Well, give it back to him.
I signed the lease.
As a matter of fact, he's all moved in.
Well, he can just all move out.
I'm going to talk to him right now.
No, now, honey, honey, you can't talk to him.
You haven't seen this man.
He couldn't take it.
Well, what are we supposed to do?
I don't know.
Oh, here he is.
Come in, Mr. Beecher, come in.
Oh, Mr. Beecher, this is my husband, Mr. Ricardo.
How do you do?
This is Mr. Beecher.
How do you do?
M- Mrs. Mertz, I don't wish to seem to be complaining straight off, but th-there's a leak in the sink Now, look here, Mr. Beecher Oh!
Oh, no!
Let me, dear let me.
Uh, Mr. Beecher, you see, we rented you the apartment for two months because my husband had a job out of town.
Well, the job was canceled, and we're not leaving.
Oh that's too bad.
Yes.
Well, you see, um, uh, I knew you'd understand and we need the apartment, so No, no.
No, no, no.
The apartment suits me perfectly.
I've got to have it.
I must.
I can't go through looking for another one.
Well, now, look here No!
Please, no!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Oh, this character's in great shape.
Well, what are we going to do now?
We'll just have to go to a hotel, I guess.
Go to a hotel for two months with a baby?
It'll cost a fortune.
Oh, I'll bet you could find a nice apartment right here in this neighborhood.
No, Ethel, it's not that easy.
They don't like to rent apartments when you got kids.
Oh, you can find one, and until you do, you can move in here with us.
Move in here with you?
!
Certainly.
We can get out the rollaway bed, and one of you can sleep on it, and one can sleep on the divan.
And we'll bring the crib out here Well, that's awfully nice of you, Ethel, but we don't want to crowd you that much.
No, honey.
So we're a little crowded.
What are friends for?
Hi.
Hi, Fred.
Hi.
Ew!
Any luck finding a place?
No.
The only ones that look decent will take pets but no children.
Too bad.
I'm so desperate, I'm thinking of tying feathers on little Ricky and telling them he's a parrot.
I bet I walked 20 miles today.
How is the baby, honey?
Oh, he was all right, except for a couple of things like crying all afternoon and spilling his food on the bedroom rug again.
Oh, Ethel, I'm sorry.
He's cutting a tooth.
I guess he's a little fussy.
Mm.
Didn't find an apartment, huh?
No.
Gee, I never thought when we came here that we'd be here a whole week.
Has it only been a week?
Well, thanks.
Oh, now, stop picking on Lucy.
It isn't her fault.
I'm doing the best I can, Fred.
She and Ricky are probably just as sick of us as we are of them.
Uh well, let's face it, honey.
This apartment is too small for five people.
Yeah.
Oh.
Lucy, will you try and keep that baby quiet?
His crying is getting on my nerves.
Well, why didn't you say so, Fred?
Little Ricky's only crying because he thought you liked it.
Isn't she ever coming out of that bathroom?
What do you suppose she's doing in there?
She's taking a bath.
She's been in there long enough to bathe an elephant.
Oh, there she is.
She didn't drown herself after all.
Oh, I'm sorry, Fred.
I guess I took a little longer than I expected.
Oh, it's okay.
It just gave Ethel and me a chance to get acquainted.
What's the matter with him?
Oh, he's all right.
He always gets cranky if he has to stay up past his bedtime.
Just as I thought!
No more hot water.
Come on, let's go get the baby's crib and bring him out in the living room again.
I'm sorry about the water.
I don't think that tank is big enough I know.
No, it isn't.
Who's ringing the doorbell at this hour of the night?
Oww!
I'm sorry.
I forgot my key, Fred.
Why is he awake this late?
What's the matter?
Did you have to forget your key twice in one week?
I'm sorry, Fred.
Told you I was sorry.
What's the matter?
Who was that at the door?
Oh, it's you.
There, honey, now.
Lucy, is the baby is gonna cry all night again tonight?
He wouldn't be crying if Fred hadn't come out here and kicked the crib.
Well, I wouldn't have kicked the crib if you didn't put it over in the middle of the room.
Oh, Fred.
Oh, come on, Fred.
Let's try and get some sleep.
All right.
Good night.
Come on.
Good night.
Good night!
Good night.
Aw  Yes, honey, Mama knows.
Yes, well Poor little Oh, honey, yes Dishes, dishes, dishes.
Somebody around here is always eating.
I must have done a hundred dishes today.
I am so tired of doing dishes.
You know, Ethel, we're not the only ones that eat around here.
I didn't say you were, dear.
It's just that everybody eats at different times.
There's one skillet out there that hasn't been cold for a week.
Well, I guess there's just one thing to do.
Yeah, but you can't find an apartment.
I meant use paper plates.
Oh.
Darn that Mr. Beecher.
It's all his fault.
If he'd just get out.
Wait a minute.
I'll do it.
You don't even know what it is.
I don't care what it is.
I'll do it if it'll get rid of Mr. Beecher.
Well, look, Mr. Beecher is a nervous wreck because he witnessed a murder.
So?
So what if he witnessed another murder?
What if he saw me kill you?
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, well, what if he saw you kill me?
It doesn't make any difference.
That's more like it.
All right.
We'll pretend that you're mad at me  Who's there?
Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, hello, Mr. Beecher.
I just dropped over to see how things were.
Oh, just fine.
This place is so nice and quiet and restful, my nerves are getting back in shape at last.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Oh, did we leave these here?
Oh, yes, yes.
I was going to return them to you.
Well, I'll be glad There you are, you heel!
You made eyes at my husband for the last time.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
All right, Ethel, let's face it.
You've lost him.
He's mine.
If I can't have him, you can't have him either.
Are you threatening me?
I am.
Mr. Beecher, you heard her threatening me.
No, no, I didn't hear a thing.
We're gonna have this out here and now.
No, please, please don't.
Mr. Beecher, if she fires that gun, you're my witness.
No, I don't want to be anybody's witness.
I- I say, look here, please.
If you've got to kill her, take her out in the hall and do it.
Oh, no, I'm gonna do it right here and now.
I'm gonna count to three and then I'm gonna let you have it.
One  Two three.
Aha.
Uh, you're, you're afraid to let me have it, huh?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I just want to watch you squirm.
Now I'm gonna count to three again and then you're gonna get it.

No, I wasn't.
Oh Yes.
Yes, Mrs yes.
Uh, that will be fine.
Thank you.
Mr. Beecher called Mrs. Hammond, but he didn't tell her a thing about it.
He said that she should go over, pick up his clothes, and he if he got his money back, he would be very happy to call off the whole deal.
Well, does he want all of his money back?
