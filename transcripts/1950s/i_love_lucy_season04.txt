{START OF EPISODE 1}
More coffee, Ricky?
Ricky?
Hello, back there.
Coffee?
Hmm?
Hey, what are you doing?
!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, the least you can do is warn a guy before you scald him to death.
Well, I asked you if you wanted more coffee and I thought you said yes.
Si queria cafe caliente ponle en la copa.
Look, I'm sorry I burned you.
I was just trying to keep busy.
It's no fun sitting here watching you read the paper.
Okay, okay.
I didn't think I was being so rude.
Well, that's better.
Here.
Wait a minute.
You take this one, huh?
My, that's interesting.
Did you read?
Why is it that the news always look grinner at the other side of the breakfast table?
I don't know.
It just looks grinner.
Well, if I'd been this woman, I'd have left my husband.
Listen to this.
"Two armed thugs entered and robbed the apartment "of George T. Craig at 527 East 65th Street last night, "tying Mrs. Craig to a chair "and leaving with an estimated $5,000 worth of jewelry, silver and furs".
Well, that's too bad, but I don't see why you're, uh Now, just wait.
"Craig, an accountant "was working in his office at the time of the robbery.
"Mrs. Craig had called earlier "to report that she thought she heard prowlers "and urged her husband to come home.
"and found my wife bound and gagged "and the apartment ransacked.
None of the goods was insured, admitted Craig".
Isn't that awful?
Terrible.
It's unforgivable.
I should say so.
Imagine not being insured.
Oh, you missed the whole point.
What do you mean?
That man didn't love his wife very much or he would have come home the minute he thought she was in danger.
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
Sure.
What would you do?
What would I do about what?
Well, if I called you and told you there were prowlers, you'd come right home, wouldn't you?
What for?
We're insured.
Well, it's nice to know how you really feel.
I was just kidding.
I'll bet you weren't.
Of course I was.
Well, if I called you at the club and told you there were prowlers, would you come right home?
The minute you call.
What if you were busy?
It wouldn't matter.
What if you were doing a number?
Would you leave in the middle of it?
Right between the "baba" and the "loo".
Oh, honey, you're wonderful.
Thank you.
Would you really come home the minute I called?
If I had the slightest hint that you were in any kind of danger, I would come flying from the ends of the earth.
Hmm  Hello.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Ricardo, please.
This is Mrs. Ricardo.
Well, even if he is in rehearsal, I have to talk to him right away.
Hello, Ricky?
Ricky, listen, a horrible, strange-looking man just came to the front door and-and he said that he was trying to sell something and I didn't believe him, so I slammed the door in his face and-and then a few minutes later, I-I heard something on the fire escape and-and I think I saw his face.
And, oh, he was just horrible-looking.
He had big, bulgy eyes and-and he had a long, black, droopy mustache and-and long, snaggly teeth.
And-and he was about seven feet tall.
You'd better hurry home, honey.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Where are you, Lucy?
!
Here I am.
Where?
!
Where?
!
Are you all right?
Oh, are you all right?
Where is he?
Where is he?
Who?
Well, Ricky just phoned from the club and said some evil-looking man was trying to break into the apartment.
Yes, he said he had a long, black beard and he was eight feet tall!
Oh, you mean he told you to come over here and protect me until he could get here, huh?
Nope.
He just wanted us to call him back if anything was wrong.
How do you like that?
Here I am in terrible danger and all he does is sit by the phone.
Are you in terrible danger?
Of course not.
Oh, Lucy, what is all this?
Well, I read in the paper this morning where some woman called her husband and told him that there were prowlers and he didn't come home and their house was robbed.
So?
So, that proves that that man did not love his wife.
So, I just called Ricky to find out if he really loved me.
Oh, no.
And, apparently, I got my answer.
I could have been murdered while he was waiting for you to call him back.
You still might be.
Fred Fred.
Oh, honestly, Lucy, how could you pull a stunt like this?
Oh, my heart's still pounding.
Yeah, mine, too.
Now, listen, Lucy, my blood pressure has better things to do than play "he loves me, he loves me not".
Well, maybe someday some-something will really happen to me and then you'll be sorry.
Do you want to bet?
Oh, Fred.
Come on, we'd better call up Ricky and tell him it was just a false alarm.
All right.
Never mind.
I'll call him.
Okay.
I have to speak to Mr. Ricardo, please.
This is Mrs. Ricardo again.
Ricky!
Ricky, where are you?
!
That man is still here!
He-he-he hid in the closet; h-he's got a gun and and when the Mertzes came in, he made me tell the Mertzes Aa-ahh, oh, no!
No!
No!
Don't do that!
Please, please!
Help!
Help!
Ricky!
Ri-Rick!
: Rick!
Rick!
Okay, Lucy, you can stop now Oh, honestly, how far can you go?
Come on, Lucy.
Ricky knows you're just calling him to test him.
Lucy?
You can come out now.
We know you're fooling.
Lucy?
Lucy?
Fred!
Fred!
Oh Now what?
Fred, Fred, look at this room.
This time I think something really has happened to her.
She's not here.
Did you look every place?
Well, I looked every place except the bedroom.
Let's look in there.
She's got to be around here someplace.
Okay.
She isn't here.
Well, you look in the bathroom and I'll look in all the closets.
The closets.
No, she isn't in there.
She wouldn't go away and leave the baby.
She never has; she's got to be around here someplace.
I think I'd better call Ricky.
Oh, I wish you wouldn't bother him.
Oh, he'd never forgive me if I didn't call him, Fred.
Oh, I don't want to disturb him now.
He's down there rehearsing.
if anything like this happened to us, you know, you know he'd want you to call him.
She'll show up in a minute.
Just take it easy.
Well, I didn't look in here.
No, you didn't look in there.
No, she's not in there either.
Oh, Fred I think this time something really has happened to her.
Oh, now, don't be so dramatic.
She's just trying to give us a good scare.
Lucy!
I'm going to call Ricky.
Oh, I wish you wouldn't disturb him.
I won't.
I won't.
Now, tell him we're not sure.
We-we think it's one of Lucy's dumb stunts.
May I speak to Mr. Ricardo, please?
Now, be nice and calm.
Don't worry.
Hello, Ricky, we're up here and Lucy's not anyplace!
Ethel!
It's nothing to get upset about!
Give me that phone!
Listen, Ricky, I think it's one of Lucy's tricks, but we can't find her anywhere, so maybe you'd better come on home.
Yes, come on home.
Yeah, come on home.
Don't worry.
We'll take care of little Ricky till you get here.
Okay.
Okay.
But come on home!
Yeah.
Is he coming?
Yes!
What happened?
!
What happened?
!
Ricky, Ricky, this is just the way we found it.
We knew you'd want to see.
Are you sure she's not hiding someplace?
Have you looked everywhere?
In the closets and everywhere, there's no I even looked behind the shower curtain.
Oh.
While we were waiting for you, I went around to the other apartments.
Nobody has seen a sign of her.
Oh, I don't know what to think.
I don't know what to think now.
I don't know whether something has really happened to her or maybe she's just yelling tiger?
What?
You know, yelling tiger.
You mean crying wolf?
Yeah.
Oh, if anything's happened to Lucy, I'll never forgive myself.
I shouldn't have gone away and left her.
How do you think I feel?
I'm the one that said I wouldn't care if something did happen to her.
What happened to her is all my fault.
I should have come home the minute that she called me.
Just think, right now she might be in terrible danger.
She might be hurt.
She might even be : Oh, I miss her already.
I said some terrible things about Lucy, but I didn't mean any of 'em.
She was a good kid.
Yes, she was.
Fred's right.
She was a good girl.
Yes, she was.
She was a wonderful girl.
Yes, she was.
Hey, what are we saying?
She is a good girl.
Nothing could have happened to her!
She is a good girl.
I bet you she's all right.
My God, if something happens to Lucy, what Gee, I love her so much, I-I just wouldn't want to live, that's all.
I'm going to call the police.
Yes, that's a good idea.
Yeah.
Wait a minute.
Supposing she's playing a trick?
Supposing it's a gag?
Well, I don't care.
We just can't take any more chances.
Who's this now?
Hello.
Hello.
Uh, Mr. Ricardo?
Yes?
You don't know me, but I'm your neighbor, Mrs. Devries.
I live in the apartment building across the street.
Yes.
Now, I'm sure there must be a very good reason, and I'm sure you know what you're doing, but is anything wrong?
Well, what do you mean?
Well, I know your wife is a little peculiar Yeah, well, look, I'm awfully busy right now.
Could-could you call me back a little later?
Well, uh I certainly can as long as you know that your wife is sitting on the ledge outside of your window.
Ah, well, don't worry about What?
!
Oh, it's a good, wide ledge.
I just wanted to make sure that everything was all right.
Oh, yes, yes, everything is just fine.
Thank you very much for calling.
Oh, you're welcome.
Good-bye.
And thank you very much for having those costumes ready for Thursday.
That's very nice of you.
Good-bye.
That was that fellow that, uh, I was worrying about the costumes for Thursday for the new show.
Well, he called me, and he said he'd have it ready Thursday.
But, uh, what about Lucy?
Aren't you going to call the police?
Yeah, I'll call them in a minute.
Isn't that nice about the costumes?
Yeah.
On second thought, I don't think I'll call the police.
It'd be bad publicity for me.
That's right, Ricky.
And after all, what can the police do?
If she's gone, she's gone, that's all.
I'll just have to get used to it.
Gee, I'm gonna miss her though.
If you miss her too much, you can always get a parrot and make it nag you and throw your money away!
No.
I think the thing to do is to get her out of my mind.
Just get rid of everything that reminds me of her.
Ethel, would you like her clothes?
Oh, yes.
There are a couple of dresses I'd like.
Of course I'll have to have them altered.
She's much bigger in the hips than I am.
Oh, Ricky, could I have those beautiful stone martins of hers?
Sure.
How about her lynx stole?
Hmm, I don't think so.
Go ahead and take it.
We can always use it for a bath mat.
You know, it's too bad about Lucy being gone and all that.
It's a bit of tough luck all right, but the worst part of it is little Ricky.
Little Rick will be without a mother.
Oh, yes.
How about that?
Without his mother to guide him.
Oh, the poor little thing.
There's only one thing for you to do, Rick: You'll have to remarry.
You really think so?
You have to think of your son.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Of course I'll have to wait a respectable length of time.
Oh, of course.
How long would you wait?
About ten days.
Lucy!
Look, a dove!
Oh, it's Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Honey, you've come back!
Yeah, a lot you care.
I'm not even cold yet, and you're already getting married again!
And you go around telling everybody I got big hips!
And as for you, you big walrus, get your wet feet off my lynx stole!
Well, what's so funny?
We knew you were outside that window all the time.
Sure.
You did not!
Yes, we did, honey.
Mrs. Devries from across the street called up and told us you were out there.
And listen, you, I just had about enough of these phony stories.
Phony?
!
What do you mean?
Why do you think I crawled out on that ledge in the first place?
I I I was trying to escape from that horrible man.
You should have seen him.
He was horrible.
Lucy?
Well, he was, and he-he forced his way in here and he chased me around and around and around.
Well, he did!
Come on, honey, you're holding up the game.
What's she doing?
Maybe she met another prowler.
I heard that.
Come on, honey.
If we're going to play bridge, let's play bridge, huh?
I'm not sure I want to play with people who make fun of me.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry, but I can't help it.
Every time you get out of our sight, you run into a bunch of cutthroats.
Where are they hiding this time, under the bed?
Now, listen to me, Fred Mertz!
All right, all right, all right!
Hold it, everybody.
Now, we all know that Lucy has a very vivid imagination and we all know that we can't believe one word she says.
Now, listen, whether you believe me or not, that man was here this afternoon.
Oh, come now, honey.
Well, he could have been.
After all, those people who were robbed live in this neighborhood and those thugs might still be around here.
You know how crooks are.
No.
How are they?
Oh, you know what I mean.
Once they rob one house in a neighborhood, they very often rob another one a couple blocks away.
She's right, Ricky.
All the crooks I know are just like that.
Once they find a neighborhood they like, they stick to it.
They're a loyal bunch.
Especially the eight-foot-tall, fiendish ones.
Oh, you're all so smart.
Now, where are you going?
Out.
I'm sure you don't care where I go or what happens to me, and neither do I. Oh, Lucy, you're going to ruin the Oh now, where do you suppose she's going?
Oh, she'll go out in the hall and sit for a while and mope and then she'll come back.
Honestly, sometimes she acts just like a baby.
Yeah.
Have you ever thought of putting her in a basket and leaving her on somebody's doorstep?
Come on, let's play three-handed till she comes back.
All right.
You bid, Rick.
Okay Ricky, she's been gone for a long time.
Don't you think you ought to go look for her?
That's just what she wants us to do.
She wants us to go out there and beg her to come back.
Are you sure she's sitting out there?
I'll go take a look.
Now, shh!
Keep quiet.
She's just sitting out there like a spoiled child.
: Come on, let's play another hand!
All right.
Okay.
: Help!
There she goes again.
Ricky!
Hey, you know, that was pretty good, the way she did that.
Ricky!
Oh, that's not so tough.
Ricky!
Help!
Help!
Ahh!
Help!
Ricky!
Help!
Help!
You know, how about that, uh, "fading away" effect?
That's, uh That's a pretty good effect.
You know, I knew a ventriloquist once who could do that with his voice.
Is that right?
Yeah.
That's pretty clever.
Uh-huh.
She's got a lot more talent than I give her credit for.
Lucy?
Lucy?
Now what?
Come on in, honey.
The door is open.
Oh, well.
Very good!
Very good!
Bravo!
Very clever.
On behalf of the academy, it's my great pleasure to present to you this beautiful statuette for the best performance of the year.
Bravo!
Bravo!
You know, what I can't understand is: How did she tie herself up like this?
Well, let's take the gag off and hear her story.
Hey, hey, Rick.
You sure you know what you're doing?
If I had Ethel gagged like this Fred!
Fred.
Well, let's hear it anyway.
Must be a good one this time.
There we go.
What's the matter with you?
You crazy or something?
Why didn't you come out there and help me?
Those two men could have killed me.
Oh, there was two men this time.
There were!
Oh.
Ricky, honest, it's true.
There really were.
Sure.
Sure.
Ricky, listen to me.
Two men came down from the attic and they grabbed me and they-they dragged me down to the basement.
Yes, dear.
Yes, dear.
But Ricky, they do, and they're loose somewhere in this neighborhood.
We're gonna something.
Oh, we're gonna something.
Well, what?
We got to finish our bridge game.
Ricky, please, you got to believe me!
Ricky, listen, I was sitting on the steps and these two men came down from the attic and they Ethel, Ethel, listen to me, please.
They grabbed me, Ethel, and they tied me up, can't you see?
Fred!
Fred, somebody, listen to me!
Fred!
Fred, they tied me up!
Fred, can't you see?
I didn't do this myself.
Listen!
Somebody, listen to me!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Oh, no, no, now, Dorothy, please.
I want to do it for you.
It's the only way.
Now, look, you and Sam come over for dinner tonight and just leave the rest to me.
Oh, now, stop worrying about it.
We'll have him in the trap before he knows what hit him.
Yeah, well, you be here tonight at All right, bye-bye.
Who are you trapping, this time, Daniel Boone?
Sam Carter, that fellow Dorothy Cooke's been going with for such a long time.
Oh, you mean she finally roped old slippery Sam?
Well, she's got the noose around his neck.
All she wants us to do is help her tighten it.
Us?
Yeah.
Oh, I don't know, I think I'm a little rusty.
It's been 25 years since I bagged fat Freddie.
Oh, nonsense.
Getting a man is just like swimming.
Once you learn, you never forget.
Anyway, I have a plan.
We are going to show Sam what it's like to be married.
First, I'm going to serve a delicious home-cooked meal, and then we'll all tiptoe in and take a look at the baby sleeping peacefully in his little crib.
And then we'll all come out here and sit around a big fire and listen to romantic music.
Oh, that'll be nice.
Won't it?
Yeah.
When are you going to show him what it's like to be married?
Now, Ethel.
Look, Ricky and I will be a wonderful example of a young married couple and you and Fred will be a wonderful example of an o oh.
You and Fred will be a wonderful example Yeah?
Well, you and Fred will be a wonderful example of a young couple who have been married 25 years.
Oh.
And are still madly in love with each other.
Me and Fred?
!
Well, look, for tonight, fake it.
Okay, I'll try.
All right.
What's so special about tonight?
She's had her hooks in Sam for three years.
I know it.
But he's leaving for California tomorrow morning.
This is her last chance to reel him in.
Tell me something, Cupid.
What?
Does Ricky know about this?
Of course not.
And there's no need to tell him either.
Look, the evening will be over, Sam will propose our mission will be accomplished and Ricky will never know he helped bring another bachelor to his knees.
Oh, hi, dear.
Hello, honey.
How's my little husband?
Oh, not so good.
Oh, what's the matter?
I got a awful headache.
Oh What's all that?
Oh, I just thought we'd have a cozy little dinner.
Just the four of us?
What did you do?
Get a girlfriend for little Ricky?
No, Dorothy and Sam are coming over.
Dorothy and Sam who?
You know.
Oh, you mean Dorothy Spider and Sam Fly.
Hasn't she got him in her parlor yet?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, look, honey, why don't you call it off?
I'm not in the mood to see anybody tonight.
But, honey, I can't call it off.
They've been planning on it for such a long time.
Oh, all right.
Hey!
Yeah?
You never mentioned this before.
When did you ask them?
Go take your shower, dear.
Lucy.
When did you ask them?
This afternoon.
Well, Sam's going away tomorrow and it's her last chance to cat Her last chance to what?
It's her last chance to have dinner here with him.
Why the sudden interest in Dorothy and Sam?
Have you been messing around with their romance?
Of course not.
I just think they're two nice people to have dinner with, that's all.
I don't care if they never get married.
What is it to me?
All right, we'll have dinner.
but let's break it up early.
I got a recording session in the morning.
I got to be in bed by 10:00.
Yeah, I'm sorry, honey, but if I don't get some rest tonight, I won't have any voice left at all.
They'll understand.
But, honey, this is your one night off.
I think it'd do you a lot more good to just sit around and relax and have a few laughs.
A few chuckles?
A little snicker?
Oh, will you get that, dear?
I'm not quite ready yet.
It figures.
Oh, hello, Dorothy!
Hi, Ricky.
Hello, Sam.
How are you?
Rick, nice to see you How have you been?
Fine, thank you.
Wonderful.
Here, give me your hat and coat.
Thank you very much.
How you been, huh?
Oh, fine.
Good.
Sit down.
Make yourselves at home.
Thanks a lot.
Um, where's Lucy?
Oh, she's not ready yet.
Oh.
You know how long it takes them, Sam.
Oh, that's right, you're not married, are you?
No.
Not yet.
Well, you're cleverer than I thought.
How you managed to keep single all these years Oh, oh, uh, Ricky, the apartment looks lovely.
Oh, thank you.
Sam, uh, they have a lovely baby.
Oh, Ricky, could we see him?
Well, I wish you could, but he's already sleeping.
Lucy doesn't like anybody to go in while he's asleep, you know.
She really puts her foot down on that.
Well, hello, honey!
Hi, Lucy.
Sam, so nice to see you again.
Thank you, Lucy.
Please sit down.
Thank you very much.
My, aren't they a handsome couple?
Oh, Sam's the handsome one.
Stop it, Dorothy.
Stop.
We were just talking about the baby.
Oh, talking about babies.
Think of the beautiful children these two could have.
Imagine, a little girl with Dorothy's lovely hair and Sam's wide-set eyes.
Yeah.
What are you laughing at?
I was just thinking, it'd be funny if she turns out to have Dorothy's lovely eyes and Sam's wide-set hair.
Oh, don't pay any attention to him.
Aw, no.
I want her to look exactly like Sam.
Oh, well, of course she would, dear.
Oh, gee, I wish the baby was awake.
Well, let's go in and look at him anyway.
What do you mean, let's go in and look at him Honey, please.
Come on.
Oh, isn't he darling?
Husky, huh?
Yes, he is.
Lucy.
Lucy, I smell something burning in the oven.
My chickens!
My chickens!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh oh, my!
Oh, my whole dinner!
My whole dinner!
My whole dinner!
Oh, no!
And then there I was in the middle of the stage, and I started singing.
Well, I was 12 years old when I sang the first song and I've been in show business ever since.
Oh, show business must be so exciting.
Yeah, it's a lot of work, but I love it.
Well, the baby is finally asleep.
I'm so sorry dinner was ruined.
Oh, you fixed something for them, dear.
No, Dorothy did.
She's a real good cook.
Well.
Best meal I had in months.
Thank you.
I have a warm plate for you in the kitchen.
Oh, no, thanks, Dorothy.
I'm not a bit hungry.
Well, as long as you're here now, I'll excuse myself.
I can't keep my eyes open.
Oh, well, I'll, I'll fix you some coffee, dear.
That'll keep those big, brown eyes open.
No, eh, eh, no, honey.
Uh, I hope you understand.
I have a recording session in the morning and I'm just dead tired.
Uh, but, honey, can't you stay just a little while longer?
We-we have company.
Well, I know, dear, and I'm awfully sorry, but All right, we understand, uh, don't we, dear?
Oh, of course.
A man should be able to do anything he wants to in his own home.
Right.
Good night.
Good night.
Ricky!
Lucy, don't shake your head at me like that.
I told you when I got home that I had to be in bed by 10:00.
I know you did, but I didn't think you meant it, dear.
Well, it's all your fault, dear.
My fault, darling?
Yes, darling.
If you would have consulted with me before you made your plans, I would have told you.
Oh, I'm so sorry, I forgot to ask your permission, Your Majesty.
Sam, we'd better go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, don't go.
Ricky is not going to bed.
Ricky is going to bed.
Ricky is not going to bed.
He's going to stay here and act happily married if it kills him.
Oh, Lucy, what's the use?
It's all ruined anyway.
What's ruined?
You were right, dear, go to bed.
Lucy?
Yes, sir.
I thought I told you to mess out.
Well, I don't care.
I only wanted Sam and Dorothy to be as happily married as I thought we were.
Well, tonight has been a glorious example.
Well, tonight doesn't count.
This isn't like any other night.
You know, the baby cried and the food burned.
Yes, that's true.
Yeah, that's true, but why did you say that tonight is not like any other night?
Now, you cut that out, Ricky Ricardo!
You're happily married, and you know it!
Well, all right.
Sit down, Sam.
Dorothy.
What are you going to do now?
I'm just going to tell Sam exactly the way I feel about marriage.
Don't you dare!
Sit down, Lucy.
Sam, my boy, I've been married over and if I had it to do over I'd get married again.
You would?
Yep, I would gladly get married again.
But why?
Now, that's a very good question, and it's a hard one to answer.
Maybe it's because wives are economical.
Well.
Look, Lucy saves me a lot of money on food.
That's right, I do.
You know, serving leftovers.
Leftovers?
Yes, she's great at serving leftovers.
But the strange thing is, I never had any of the meals that the leftovers were left over from.
Ricky!
And yet, I would get married all over again.
I don't know why.
Maybe it's the mystery of it all.
The mystery?
Yeah.
You know, Sam, you would think that you would know what your wife looks like when you married her, right?
Well, of course, you would.
You got a big surprise coming to you, my boy.
They have a whole other face underneath the face you married.
And it must be awful because they never let you see it.
You know, when they go to bed at night?
Yeah.
They cover it all up with cold cream, and then they get their chins strapped in a hammock.
They wear blinkers over their eyes.
And in the mornings ay-ay-ay, in the mornings They come staggering out of bed with wire cages in their hair, grease in their face, and then they proceed to the kitchen where they squeeze you a glassful of seeds with a little bit of orange juice in it.
They throw some raw bacon and eggs at you with some burned toast and they give you a cup of coffee that tastes just like mud.
Well, I'm very happy to find out how you really feel.
Hi!
Hi.
Oh, no.
Lover and I thought we'd come up and find out how you were doing.
We can't stay very long 'cause you know how honeybunch and I love to be alone.
Married 25 years and still mad about each other.
Oh, shut up.
It's too late, Ethel.
Lucy!
Don't you talk to me, you you husband.
Honey, I said I would marry you all over again!
Well, I wouldn't marry you again!
You had it coming to you.
I told you not to butt in other people's business!
Oh, dear.
Let's go.
Come on.
: Come on!
: All right!
I wonder what went wrong.
I don't know, but stop leaning on me.
You weigh a ton!
Lucy, how about my breakfast?
There's your orange juice.
Oh, I left a few seeds in it as usual.
I burn an awful lot of toast, but I'm developing quite a beat.
Here you are, my famous cup of mud.
Well, how do you like it?
Like what?
This is the distorted picture you gave Sam last night.
Now, if you'd like to apologize for all the nasty things you said, I'd be very happy to go ahead and fix your breakfast as I usually do.
You just did.
Oh!
And I suppose I look like I usually do, too, huh?
No, no, I wouldn't say that.
I think you look a little better.
Ricky Ricardo, you apologize!
Why should I apologize?
The only reason that I told Sam the things I told him last night is because you and Dorothy were trying to hook him, and I told you to stay out of his affairs.
Well, for once, I decided not to do what you told me.
For once?
You never do what I told you.
Then why don't you quit "tolding" me?
Ay, que barbaridad!
Porque tienes la cabeza mas dura de ninguna mujer que yo he conocido en toda la vida entera!
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but Spanish names won't hurt me.
Sometimes I wish I never left Cuba.
That makes two of us.
You take that back.
I won't take it back.
You take back what you said last night.
I will not!
Now, are you going to fix my breakfast or not?
I already did, remember?
All right, then I'll eat breakfast downtown.
Good!
Hmm!
And you can have your lunch down there, too.
All right!
And your dinner!
Okay!
You can stay down there, too!
Okay, I will!
Ha!
Good-bye!
Well, I will as soon as I change.
Lucy!
He isn't home yet, Ethel, and it's He wasn't home at 3:00 and he wasn't home at 4:00 either.
Are you gonna come over every hour just to announce that he isn't home yet?
Well, he isn't.
Leave the door open, will you?
I want to hear the baby.
Listen, Lucy, didn't you tell me that when you had your fight, you told him to go away and stay away?
Yes, I did, but I didn't think he'd do it.
Oh, well, now, that makes sense.
Gee, Ethel, well, what if he isn't ever coming home?
Well, what what if something's happened to him?
Oh, now, Lucy, you've got to stop worrying.
You're getting yourself all upset.
I can't help it.
Put yourself in my place.
If Fred was gone and was never coming home, what would you be doing?
Celebrating.
You would not.
It isn't until they're gone that you really appreciate them.
Oh, Ethel, I love him so.
Lucy, don't cry.
Hey, hey What in Sam Hill's all the commotion about?
Oh, Ricky still isn't home and Lucy's all upset.
He isn't ever coming home, and it's my fault.
Oh, now, honey, he's coming home.
I'm, I'm sure he's all right.
Sure, you'll probably find him down at the police station, wearing a cop's hat and eating an ice-cream cone.
Oh, dear, if I, if I knew where he was, I'd call him up, and I'd beg him to come home.
Did you call the club?
Yes.
He left two hours ago.
Oh, suppose we wait a couple of weeks and notify Ellery Queen.
Now, Fred, this is serious.
I just don't happen to think that it is serious.
Now, listen, Lucy, I know Ricky pretty well and I just don't believe he's really gonna leave you.
Then where is he?
He's doing what any other husbands are doing under the same circumstances.
He's just staying away long enough to give you a good scare.
Do you really think so?
Sure, he's getting you good and worried so you'll be so glad to see him, you'll forget you're mad at him.
Well, if that's what he's doing, then I just won't be there when he gets home!
What?
!
Two can play at this game.
I'll just give him a good scare.
Well, why don't you go home and give it to him.
No, I'm not going home; I'm going to stay right here.
What about the baby?
You go over and keep an eye on him, will you, Ethel?
No.
Please?
No.
But, Ethel, I can't just be over there, standing there, waiting for him when he comes in.
Please.
Absolutely not!
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I'll go and stay with little Ricky.
It's about the only way I'll ever get a night's sleep.
Okay, thanks, Fred.
Okay.
Ethel Ethel, what if Fred isn't right?
What if Ricky really isn't ever gonna come home?
What if?
What if you keep quiet and let me get some sleep?
All right.
Ethel!
Ethel!
Ethel, he's home.
I just saw him come down the hall, and he brought me candy and flowers.
Good.
Lucy?
Lucy, I'm home.
Sweetheart I guess I owe you an apology.
I shouldn't have said all of those awful things that I said.
I was in a bad humor and I just blew my top, that's all.
But darling, you know I love being married to you, honey.
You are the dearest, sweetest, most wonderful person in the whole world.
You know, I wasn't gonna come home tonight just to teach you a lesson, and then I got to walking around and I I started thinking of all the wonderful times that we had together and how much we meant to each other and Well I brought you some flowers and some candy.
Honey, I-I won't blame you if you never spoke to me again, but sweetheart, please say you forgive me, darling.
: I forgive you, darling.
What are you doing here?
Oh, honey, you should have heard yourself saying all those things to Fred.
Fred, how did you keep from laughing?
It wasn't easy.
Well, I'm real happy I gave you all such a good laugh.
Oh, honey, don't be mad.
Who's mad?
!
I'm not mad!
Who's going to get mad?
I'm not mad at all!
Oh, honey, we're sorry.
We're all sorry, Ricky.
Oh, Rick Ricky, where are you going?
Out!
And this time, I'm not gonna come back!
But, honey, how about all those things you said?
You said you loved me and all the wonderful times we had and everything.
I take them all back!
Oh, Ricky Out of my way, please.
Listen, Ricky, Ricky, I won't mess in any more romances.
I'll mess out, I promise.
Out of my way, please.
Please?
Oh, now what?
We must be making too much noise.
Telegram.
Oh.
Who's it from?
Yeah.
What's it say?
Oh, no.
Oh, honey "We figured if you two characters "could put up with each other for 13 years "there must be something to this marriage business, "so we are giving it a try.
Thanks a lot.
Dorothy and Sam".
Aw, honey.
Oh, baby!
Ha, ha, Rick!
Here.
Oh, thank you!
Here.
Oh, thank you!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Breakfast will be ready in a few minutes, honey.
Okay.
Morning, Lucy.
Hi.
Brought up your mail.
Thank you.
Nothing but bills.
Bills, bills, bills.
That's all I ever get anymore.
Hey, speaking of bills, I hate to bring it up, but how about the rent?
Please, not before breakfast, Ethel.
Well, you know, I don't care, honey, but last night Fred found out you'd only paid half the rent.
Couldn't you have kept it from him?
You just be happy he didn't find out it was half of last month's rent.
Shh!
Oh, Ethel, my accounts are all messed up.
These are second and third notices from every company in town.
They're threatening to shut off everything but my oxygen supply.
: Lucy.
How many of these things do they send before they really shut things off?
I don't know.
Hey, I got a friend that works at the power company.
You want me to call her up and find out how many they send?
Okay.
Yeah.
Lucy.
What?
There's no dial tone.
They didn't.
I'm afraid they did.
They can't do that to me!
Why, I've been giving them all my telephone business for years.
I thought you said breakfast was ready.
Honey, my mouth was all set for waffles.
Oh, well, waffles are so fattening.
Dry cereal's better for you.
Better for me, too.
All right, anything, just as long as I eat something.
Okay.
It's kind of dark in here.
What's the matter with this light?
Maybe it's a bad bulb?
All our lights are out.
Maybe the power is all off all over the neighborhood?
No.
I know what happened.
Well, I meant to pay the light bill, Ricky.
I was going to say it was probably Fred fooling around with the fuse box again.
Oh, me and my big mouth.
Lucy.
Lucy.
There's nobody in here but us deadbeats.
Lucy, you come out here.
Lucy!
Now, where do you think you're going?
Oh, hi, dear, I'm just going down to see Ethel.
I'll be back in a couple of years.
Lucy.
You come back here.
Yes, sir?
I want an explanation.
Well, sir, I've had trouble with my household budget before, sir, but this is the worst it's been in 13 years, sir, and uh Well, sir, uh, what with the taxes and inflation and the high cost of living, sir, uh it's hard to know which way the economic pendulum will swing.
Uh well, sir, I How long are you going to let me talk before you slug me?
You know what I'm going to do?
What?
I'm gonna get a business manager.
A business manager?
Yeah, a business manager.
A lot of people in show business have them.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Well, how does it work?
Well, he handles all the money and pays all the bills.
Oh, well, that'll be wonderful!
Well, it'll cost a little; I think it'll be worth it.
I'll call him right now.
Or is there any point in me trying to use the telephone?
Well, you can try it, but I think you'd have more luck with two cans and a string.
Mr. Hickox, I hope you don't have too much trouble figuring out my bookkeeping system.
You know, I'm not exactly a CPA.
I'm well aware of that, Mrs. Ricardo.
Well aware of that.
But I've been in this business for 20 years, and I've never had any trouble figuring out any books yet.
Oh.
Congratulations.
What for?
I've finally found a set of books I can't figure out.
Now, I tell you what we think you'd better do.
We'll, we'll wipe the slate clean and start all over, all right?
Yes, sir, I'd like that.
That's fine.
Now, here's your allowance for this month.
Oh, thank you.
Well, I wish it was this easy to get money out of Ricky.
That's what I'm here for, Mrs. Ricardo-- to make things easier for you and Mr. Ricardo.
Oh.
Well, is this all there is to it?
You just give me the money and I spend it?
Well, something like that.
Oh, boy, how long has this been going on?
Lucy, we Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, hi.
I didn't know you had company.
Oh, that's all right.
Mr. Hickox, this is Fred and Ethel Mertz.
They own this building.
And this is Mr. Andrew Hickox, our new business manager.
Oh, how do you do?
How are you?
Well, are we just about all figured out, Mr. Hickox?
Well, not quite, Mrs. Ricardo.
As well as I can figure out from these books, you owe a few back bills.
A few, yes.
I'd like to start you off even with everybody.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Now, let me see.
The milk bill, $20.
I'll take care of that for you.
Thank you.
Oh.
Oh, out of here?
That's what the allowance is for-- to pay the bills Twenty?
How about the month and a half rent?
Uh, I'll take care of that for you.
Thank you.
Now, let me see, telephone, $11.25.
Gas and electric, $8.75-- that's $20.
Twenty more.
And the cleaning and laundry, $15 even.
There we are.
Now you can spend the rest any way you want.
The rest?
There's just $5 left.
Five dollars.
$5 to buy food and have my hair dyed-- done?
Well, at least I have a choice.
I can be a thin redhead or a fat brunette.
We'll see you later, Lucy.
Come on, Fred.
Oh, listen, Ethel, may I speak to you in the kitchen privately?
What did you want?
Where's the money?
Old sticky fingers got it away from me.
Oh Well, I couldn't have loaned it to you anyway as long as he knew I had it.
Well, Mr. Hickox is just gonna have to give me more money.
Oh, I'll bet you can't talk him into it.
I'll bet I can.
What makes you think so?
He's a man, isn't he?
I have a feeling your old wheedle, plead and cry routine won't work on him.
Want to bet?
How much?
Five dollars.
Okay.
Mr. Hickox, I, uh I know you want to be fair about this but, uh, after all, I'm no magician, and the way things worked out, $5 is all that I have left for the whole month.
I know.
That's $5 for everything, not to mention miscellaneous.
Yes.
Uh that comes to about $1.25 a week.
Right.
Uh, per day that is only Correct.
Well, obviously, a family of three cannot live on that.
True.
So, you will just have to give me more money.
Not a chance.
Well, my goodness, it's our money!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ricardo.
But that's what you hired me for.
Well, we didn't hire you to keep our money when we need it.
Now, Mr. Hickox, I'm just going to have to have more money.
After all, half of that money is mine.
I worked very hard around here.
I take care of the house and I take care of that baby and if you don't appreciate what I do, then I guess you just don't want me around here!
I can always take little Ricky and-and leave you, you selfish beast!
You'd better save that for Mr. Ricardo.
Oh.
Now, look Mr. Hickox, I can't believe that a charming, wonderful, understanding man like you would refuse to give me a few paltry little dollars.
Uh, Mrs. Ricardo Oh, my goodness!
I never noticed what beautiful blue eyes you have.
Did anyone ever tell you you look like Clark Gable?
No.
Oh.
Well, now, Mrs. Ricardo, I'm afraid you find me a little hardhearted.
You have to be in my business.
After all, I'm only doing it for your own good.
I know.
I know, Mr. Hickox, it's all right.
Don't worry about me, I'll manage somehow.
Of course, towards the end of the month, we'll probably get pretty hungry, and the baby won't have any milk, the poor little thin thing.
Well, now, Mrs. Ricardo, you probably have a point there as far as food is concerned.
I tell you what I'll do.
You'll give me more money?
No.
I'll arrange some credit, and you can charge your groceries at the store.
Bu-But what about some extra money for me for the for the movies and my clothes and my hair?
You can use your $5 for that.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh I'm going shopping.
Is there anything I can get for you?
They're having a sale at Saks.
Please, Ethel, don't rub it in.
I'm sorry.
I know there's nothing I can get for you, is there?
Not unless they're selling money marked down to nothing.
Aw, you poor little thing, you don't have any fun anymore, do you?
Oh, sure, I get to go to the market and pinch the melons and smell the ground coffee.
Lucy Hmm.
can I ask you a personal question?
What?
You haven't had your hair touched up for two weeks.
What does it look like under that scarf?
Looks like I'm wearing a black beanie.
I'll bet.
See you later.
Happy shopping.
Happy market.
Oh, say, as long as you're going down there, would you get me a couple of things?
Sure.
Let's see, I need a loaf of whole wheat bread and a bottle of half-and-half and a pound of round steak.
Bread, half-and-half and round steak.
Well, hello, George, long time no see.
They're making the bills smaller, aren't they?
Oh, Lucy, it hasn't been that long.
You know, I could pull a fast one on Mr. Hickox and charge your groceries along with mine and just keep this money.
Yeah.
Would serve him right.
Yeah, I'll see you later.
Ethel!
Why not?
You wouldn't!
Oh, wouldn't I?
Don't you need some more groceries today, Ethel?
No, no, I don't.
Well, how about tomorrow and the day after?
I'll do your shopping every day.
Well what have I got to lose?
And, hey Where are you going?
What are you going to do?
Who are you going to call?
What I'm doing for you, I can do for everybody in this building.
Hello, Mrs. Trumbull, this is Lucy Ricardo.
Oh, I'm fine, dear.
I was just off to the market and I was wondering, could I pick something up for you?
Oh, no, no trouble at all.
I'd be glad to.
All right.
Uh-huh.
Dozen oranges, yeah and a quart of milk Oh, come in, Mrs. Trumbull.
I came up to get my daily delivery, Mrs. Ricardo.
Yeah, I'll get your list.
Let's see now Benson, Williams, Trumbull.
Can of green beans.
Yes.
There we are.
A box of crackers.
Yes.
I got the saltines.
That's the kind.
Oh, and I got a big, fat, roasting chicken for you.
All right.
It's a beauty.
Oh.
And a quart of milk Yes.
And a bottle of sherry.
Cooking sherry.
Cooking sherry.
There we are, that's $4.23.
Here you are, $4 and, uh 23 cents.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mrs. Ricardo, I hate to seem nosy.
Do you mind if I ask why you're doing this?
Oh, I don't know, Mrs. Trumbull, it's just a hobby.
A hobby?
Yeah, you know, some people collect stamps, I buy groceries.
I guess it takes all kinds.
Oh, morning, Mrs. Trumbull.
Hi, Lucy.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, I almost forgot.
Tomorrow will you buy me a can of All Pet?
All Pet?
For my cat.
Oh, yes, yes, uh-huh.
Tuesday buy can All Pet.
Yeah.
Thank you.
All right, dear.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Bye, Mrs. Trumbull.
Well, how's the redheaded greengrocer?
I'm fine.
You want your order?
Yep.
Loaf of bread.
Mm-hmm.
Some waxed paper.
Yep.
Mayonnaise.
Mm-hmm.
I got the large one.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
Where's my flour?
Right here.
Oh, here it is.
Yeah, right.
That's, uh, $3.80.
$3.80 okay, got it right here.
One, two, three  Thank you.
How are you doing?
Fine.
I've been in business a week-- I got more money than I know what to do with.
Lucy, I hate to be the one to wipe that smile off your face, but do you realize that at the end of the month, you have got to pay that bill at the market?
Oh, no, I don't.
Mr. Hickox does.
He's the one that arranged the credit.
But it's your money.
But it's his responsibility.
He's the business manager, let him manage.
Honey, I'm home.
Uh I'll be right there, dear.
Hi, dear.
Hello, honey.
You had your hair done.
Yeah, this morning.
It looks nice, but, uh, how could you afford it?
Oh, there are ways.
Is that a new dress?
Yes.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
But, uh, what cooks?
Hair and a new dress Where you get the money?
Please, I don't discuss money anymore.
You'll have to talk to my business manager.
Well, I don't get it.
My allowance is completely gone.
Bad planning, dear.
I don't even have enough money for a haircut.
My goodness.
Oh, dear, and you do look a little seedy.
What with the nightclub and all, you really should look your best, dear.
Here you are.
Go get yourself a haircut.
While you're at it, get a manicure and a shave.
Keep the change.
Lucy, wait a minute!
Where you getting all this money?
Please, never mind.
We really should have gotten a business manager a lot sooner, dear.
Hey, Rick?
Yeah, Fred.
Where are you?
Here.
Oh, I came over to see if you two kids could go to the movies with us.
I'll pay for it.
Well, that's all right.
I'll go with you, but you don't have to pay for it.
We're not that broke yet.
Oh.
As a matter of fact, Lucy is loaded.
Loaded?
She just showed me a roll of bills that big around.
Ah.
She been borrowing money from you?
Are you out of your mind?
Yeah, I guess I should have known better than to ask that.
Where is she getting the money?
Well, maybe your business manager got soft-hearted.
Are you kidding?
Mr. Hickox?
He makes you look like Diamond Jim Brady.
Well, come to think about it, Lucy and Ethel have been whispering together until I get near and then they shut right up.
Can't you get Ethel to tell you what it's all about?
No, for once those big blabbery lips are sealed.
I'm telling you, something is cooking, but I sure can't find out what it is.
Well, I only got one clue.
What's that?
Well, they had their heads together the other day and before they saw me, I think I heard Lucy say something about the market.
The market?
Yeah.
The market?
Yeah.
That's it.
That must be it.
What?
Lucy's playing the stock market.
Lucy Ricardo?
Well, I know it sounds kind of crazy and everything, but, you know, sometimes people, th-th-they get hunches on what horses to play what stock to buy.
Maybe she has a sixth sense.
Well, she might; she never had any before.
Well, I know that it's crazy, but, uh, what if she is playing the stock market?
Well, then we'd all better get ready for another crash.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's too fantastic to be true.
I wish I knew where she's getting all that money.
So do I. Hey, Fred.
Come here.
Look at this.
Read that.
"Tuesday buy can All Pet".
That's it.
That's it, what?
That must be the stock that she's investing her money in tomorrow.
That doesn't sound like stock.
Well, you know how they list them sometimes.
Come on, let's look at the stock exchange.
All right.
Here's the paper.
Can All Pet.
Here it is.
Can All Pet.
C Canadian Allied Petroleum.
Are you sure you're right?
Look, right underneath-- Can All Pet preferred.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
And look at the price, look how cheap it is.
Well, maybe Lucy's got a tip that it's going up.
How do you like that?
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna call Mr. Hickox right now and tell him to buy me some of that stock.
Yeah?
Yes, and a dozen chocolate cookies, two lemon pies, a devil's food cake and a jar of strawberry jam.
Yes, and 25 pounds of sugar.
: Well, I know it sounds like a lot, but I have quite a sweet tooth.
How's that?
Oh, yes, I know we're running up quite a bill.
$473?
Oh, well, don't worry about it.
Our business manager will take care of it at the end of the month.
Yes, good-bye.
Lucy!
Yeah?
Lucy, guess what!
What?
Look!
Look!
Where did you get all that money?
The same place you got your money from.
I don't know what you mean.
Where?
The market.
You know.
Who told you?
If Ethel blabbed Nobody told me!
Nobody told me!
I just found that pad where you write your tips on.
My tips?
Yeah.
How did you know what to buy?
It's amazing!
Amazing?
What are you talking about?
I just buy what the people want.
Oh just buy what the people want.
That's sounds very easy.
But how do you know what the people want?
How do you know what to buy and when to buy it?
How did you-- a typical, ordinary New York housewife-- know that today was the day to buy Canadian Allied Petroleum?
How you know that?
Canadian Allied Petroleum?
How did you know that?
Well, uh What?
Sit down.
Sit down.
Let-Let's start from the beginning, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
Now, look, Fred overheard you say something to Ethel about the market.
Uh-huh.
Well, we couldn't dream that it could possibly be the stock market.
But then I found that pad there where you had written "buy can All Pet".
"Tuesday, buy can All Pet".
So I looked in the stock exchange and there it was, as big as life: "Canadian Allied Petroleum"!
Canadian Allied Petroleum.
Yeah.
So, I-I called Mr. Hickox and I told him to buy me some of the stock.
So you know what he say?
He said it was bad stock.
Bad stock.
He said it was bad stock.
Yeah.
I fire him.
You what?
I fired him.
Well-well, what for?
Well, who needs him?
I do.
Now, honey, we can trust your judgment a lot better than we can trust his.
And we can pay our own bills.
We can?
Sure.
Now, honey, tell me something.
Um Where did you get this-this- this power you have?
Is it, uh, is it some kind of a sixth sense?
Yeah.
Yeah, th-th-that's it.
Some kind of a sixth sense.
I, um I found out that if I just stand still and listen, a little voice tells me what to buy.
A little voice, eh?
Yeah.
And, uh, and yesterday it said, : "Buy Canadian allied" "Petroleum".
"Petroleum," yeah.
How about that?
Well look, honey, I made $1,000 on this stock.
A thousand?
!
$1,000.
So I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you half of it.
Oh, boy.
There you are, 500 bucks.
Boy.
Now I suppose you're going to put it right back in the market?
Yeah, that's what I'm going to do with it all right.
Well, um Uh What looks good?
What does the little small voice say today?
I haven't asked it.
Oh, I Uh shh shh That's funny.
What's the matter?
He ain't talking?
Uh I-I can't hear anything.
Um Lucy to Little Small Voice.
Come in, Little Small Voice.
Over.
Lucy to Little Small Voice.
Come in, Little Small Voice.
Over.
I'm sorry, Ricky.
I guess the spell was broken once you found out.
Well, keep trying, honey.
Keep trying.
Well, I'll try, but I don't really think there's any use, dear.
We'll have time.
Keep trying, dear.

{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hi.
Hi, honey.
How was the luncheon?
Ethel, it was absolutely fabulous.
Carol and I went to 21 for lunch.
How's the baby?
Oh, he's fine.
He's asleep.
Wait till you hear what happened.
Ricky will just die when he hears.
So what happened?
When we went in, it was so crowded, we sat with some friends of Carolyn's, and who do you think the man turned out to be?
Who?
Harvey Cromwell.
Harvey Cromwell!
Yes!
Who's he?
Oh, Ethel, don't you know anything?
He's Cromwell, of Cromwell, Thatcher and Waterbury.
They're just about the biggest advertising agency in the country, that's all.
No kidding?
Yes, and while we were having lunch, Mr. Cromwell just happened to mention that his agency was looking for a new TV personality to build a whole show around.
So, naturally, I brought up Ricky's name.
Naturally.
I was very subtle.
Oh, I can imagine-- like a garlic sandwich.
Now, Ethel, I wasn't.
I have an appointment for Ricky to see Mr. Cromwell tomorrow morning.
No kidding!
I have.
Gee, Ethel, this will mean a whole new career for Ricky, and it'll all be because of me.
Oh, Ricky will help a little.
Oh, of course.
He's very talented, but you know what they say-- behind every great man there's a great woman.
Mamie Eisenhower-- we're all back there.
Well, if it gets dull back there, you can always start a bridge game.
Oh, Ethel, we're all behind our husbands, guiding their destinies.
We're puppeteers behind the scenes, pulling the strings.
Well, here's Howdy Doody now.
Hi, doll!
Hello, honey!
Wait till you hear what I did today.
It may change our whole life.
What you do?
I went to lunch at 21.
No!
I went to lunch with a certain man.
Well, I hope you two will be very happy.
All right, if you don't want to hear it, I won't tell you.
I won't tell you what big agency man wants to build a whole TV show around you.
Say, honey, what you do today?
Well, that's better.
You said you had lunch at 21 with a certain man?
Yes, and he's a big agency man and he has a sponsor who's looking for a show.
No kidding?
Yes, and I told him all about you and I said that you had some wonderful ideas for shows and he wants to see you tomorrow morning.
Why, honey, that's wonderful!
Isn't that great?
Thank you.
Tomorrow morning!
Yeah.
Boy, I'd better have some good ideas when I go to see him.
Yeah.
Let me see now what would be good?
Yeah, what would be good for us?
Yeah, what would be good?
Us?
Yeah, us, as in we.
We?
Yes, we, as in you and me?
No.
No?
Yes, no-- as in not you.
Aw, now, Ricky, that isn't fair.
I started this whole thing.
It's my chance to go coast to coast.
Now, look, honey, I love this country.
It's been very good to me.
I wouldn't think of doing a thing like that to my fellow citizens.
Well, all right, then.
I think I get the full import of that.
I don't have to have a brick wall fall on me.
I can take a hint.
Hint?
Oh, shut up.
You may be interested to know, sir, that I wouldn't be on your program now if you begged me!
Well, that's a very sensible attitude.
Now, who's this man I'm supposed to see?
Lucy, what's the name of the man?
Man?
What man?
Aw, come now!
You can't do that to me.
You wouldn't ruin my chance.
Why not?
You're ruining mine.
Oh, now, Lucy, that's not fair.
I'll thank you if you'd keep out of this.
Well, I won't let you do it.
Ricky, I'll tell you his name.
Traitor.
Ethel, what's his name?
Well Actually, Ethel, you know, we don't need Ricky.
We could build a show around you and Fred and me.
Ethel, what's his name?
It's Isn't that funny?
I forgot.
Well, it doesn't matter, anyway.
I know those agency guys.
He was just probably talking.
Oh, no, he wasn't.
He has a sponsor and the time all cleared.
Sure, sure.
Well, he has, and he's a very big man.
Big man!
He's probably been saving all month just so he could go to 21 for lunch once.
Probably an office boy.
Office boy!
That's a fine thing to call Ha Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, no, you see what he's trying to do?
He thinks he's so smart, trying to trick me into saying Harvey Cromwell.
Ow!
Harvey Cromwell!
Boy, I'll say he's a big man.
Thank you, honey.
I'll see him first thing in the morning.
Harvey Cromwell!
I've given the green light on this project, so let's get right at it.
Let's take it right over tackle and remember, the game isn't over until the last out.
Mr. Cromwell Yes, Mr. Taylor?
Mr. Ricardo is here to see you.
Send him in.
Yes, sir.
You may come in now.
Thank you, Mr. Taylor.
Hello, Mr. Cromwell.
Oh, hello, Mr. Ricardo.
It's very kind of you to see me, sir.
It's my pleasure.
Thank you.
Now, we need a show for the Phipps Department Store, and our problem is: What kind of a show?
Well, I Uh, sit down, sit down, Taylor.
Let's get as much brain matter on this as possible.
Sit down, Ricardo.
Thank you.
Well, I had an idea I'll take the bull by the horns before any more water passes under the bridge.
Everybody think.
Well, I made a pilot Shh, Ricardo!
Think!
Now I'm just thinking out loud.
This is right off the top of my head, but try this on for size.
Now, the sponsor wants to appeal to the women in the audience, right?
I'll buy that.
So, how about one of those husband-and-wife TV shows?
No, no.
Oh, it's close, very close.
There's a lot of good stuff there, but it won't quite wash.
No, no, no, it won't boil the water.
Think!
I've got it!
What?
A Mr. and Mrs. TV show!
You mean a husband-and-wife show?
That's just what you Oh, what an idea, H.C.!
Thank you.
But that's your Oh, that idea is sheer genius.
Thank you, thank you.

Well, Mr. Cromwell, I'm afraid that What's the matter, you're married, aren't you?
Yes, sir, but, uh, you don't A charming wife.
I met her yesterday.
She thinks she's very talented.
Yes, sir, that's just the point Now, look, here, Ricardo!
I'm a very busy man.
We've got the train on the track.
Let's not fumble the ball.
It's a husband-and-wife show or nothing.
Well, if you'd just give me a chance to explain.
Taylor, find out if Cugat is available.
: Ya-ya-ya-yi!
I'll do it.
Good boy!
Now, I can count on you and your wife?
Yes, sir, you can count on us.
Thank you very much, Mr. Cromwell.
Thank you, Mr. Taylor.
Mr. Ricardo.
And don't worry, sir, we'll, uh we'll boil the water before it passes under the bridge that the train track is on.

Good morning, darling.
Good morning, sweetheart.
Would you like to say good morning to our TV viewers?
Oh, whoo-hoo!
Good morning, everyone.

I was sleeping on a Phipps Foam Mattress.
A Phipps Foam Mattress rocks you to sleep.
Ah Is breakfast ready?
Oh, yes, darling.
Thank you.
Waffles!
That's right, dear.
Mmm!
It's delicious!
Of course, dear.
I got it from Phipps Fountain and Tea Room.
Food always tastes better when they fix it.
I don't know what they do to it.
Oh, girls!
Girls, I just want to tell you something that happened to me.
It was so exciting yesterday.
I got out of bed feeling rather drab and dull, you know, sort of ugh!
And then I went to Phipps, and I found the most adorable pair of shoes and the dreamiest new dress and I got the full treatment at Phipps Beauty Salon.
Well, I just felt like a new woman.
If you'll excuse me, I'd like to show you what Phipps did for me.
Would you excuse me?
Excuse me, darling.
Certainly.
And while my lovely wife has gone to change to show you what Phipps did for her, I'd like you to meet our lovable and wonderful neighbors, our very good friends, the Mertzes.
Fred and Ethel!
Good morning!
Hello!
Good morning!
Hello out there in TV land.
And what have you two early birds been up to?
We've been shopping.
Mm-hmm.
You have been shopping?
Yeah.
Where?
Oh when we go on shopping trips Where else would we go but Phipps?
From the top floor to the bottom If it's bargains, Phipps has got them Down at Phipps, your credit's great Ask today for a Phipps-a-plate First on your list of shopping tips Put : P-P-P P-h-i-p-p-s, Phipps.
P-P-P  Okay, that's great.
Did you like it?
Did I sound all right?
Oh, you sounded marvelous.
Well, I think that'll be enough rehearsing for today.
Oh, aren't we going to do the rest of it?
Oh, no.
I don't want you to go stale.
Oh.
Mr. Cromwell likes it to look unrehearsed, like you just did.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well, uh look, I'm due down at the club, so I'll see you all later.
All right, darling.
Bye, honey.
Bye, dear.
Oh, uh, everybody back here at 8:00 in the morning and we'll have a dress rehearsal before we go on the air.
Okay.
We'll be here.
Wasn't that fun?
Honey, I love the way you sounded.
Your harmony was great.
Thanks.
Bye.
See you later, honey.
Bye, sweetheart, Mr. Taylor, was the show really all right?
Is it really gonna be good?
It looks great.
In my opinion, we're gonna have a hit.
Oh, good.
Mr. Cromwell certainly had a good idea here.
Mr. Cromwell?
This was Ricky's idea.
No, it was Mr. Cromwell's idea.
Are you sure?
Well, I was there when he thought of it.
Really?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, your husband didn't go for the idea.
But Mr. Cromwell said it would be a Mr. And Mrs. Show or nothing.
Oh, he said that, did he?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, well, we're all packed up.
Is it all right if we leave the equipment set up till tomorrow?
Mm-hmm.
Fine, thank you.
See you in the morning.
Oh, and don't be nervous.
You're going to be sensational.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh!
It Oh, is Mr. Taylor gone?
I wanted to ask him if he thought this dress would look all right on television.
What do you think?
It's just perfect.
You'll look like a test pattern.
Well!
What happened to you?
I'll tell you what happened to me.
Mr. Taylor just informed me that doing a Mr. and Mrs. Show was not Ricky's idea at all!
It wasn't?
No, it was Mr. Cromwell's idea and Ricky tricked me because Mr. Cromwell said it was a Mr. and Mrs. Show or nothing!
Ohh!
Well!
That's the end of this show for me!
I'm not going to do it.
Oh, now, Lucy, if you don't do it, then none of us can be on it!
That's too bad.
But this is your big chance!
Are you going to muff it?
You can call me "Little Miss Muff It"!
Now, Lucy, that doesn't sound like you at all-- to quit, to walk out!
Gee, if you were planning on going on the show and lousing it up, I could understand that, but I never heard you say you were gonna quit before or walk out Hey, hey, wait a minute, maybe you got something there.
Now, Lucy Lucy, what are you going to do?
Maybe I won't want to be on the show.
Oh, I won't do anything on the show, but I can give him a good scare at dress rehearsal, and then he can apologize to me before I do the show.
All right, everybody in their places for dress rehearsal.
Okay.
Go right there.
Go behind the door there.
That's right.
Dress rehearsal now.
Make it a real good one, eh?
Okay.
: It looks like we're going to get away with it.
They really think this is only a dress rehearsal.
Sure.
I told you I was going to fool them.
I set every clock in the house back one hour, Even the Mertzes clocks set back one hour.
Oh, that's great.
They'll be so much more relaxed if they don't know they're on the air.
Sure.
Ooh, we're almost ready.
Good luck, Ricky.
Thank you.
Now listen, everybody, I want to start our dress rehearsal in just ten seconds.
You ready?
Yes.
I want you to go through the whole thing from start to finish without stopping, just like we were on the air.
Don't stop for anything no matter what happens.
No matter what happens?
No matter what happens.
Okay, here we go.

Hi!
Hi, girl.
What are you doing tonight?
Can you come over to dinner?
Well, Ricky isn't coming home for dinner, but I can come.
Good.
What's the occasion?
Fred's old vaudeville partner is in town.
Not the other half of "Laugh Till It Hurts with Mertz and Kurtz"!
Barney Kurtz.
Oh, for heaven's sake!
We didn't even know he was in this country.
He's been entertaining royalty all over Europe.
I saw the postcards.
Oh, that's right.
Listen, can I borrow your big silver tray?
Sure.
Oh, I'm afraid it's going to need a little cleaning.
Oh, that's all right.
Thanks.
We have to put on a little dog so Barney will think Fred has done all right, too.
What do you mean?
Fred has nothing to be ashamed of.
Oh, I know, but he's so jealous of Barney 'cause Barney stayed in show business and got to be a big star.
Yeah.
Fred got out all of his press notices this morning and put them all around the room in discreet places.
Oh, no!
: Oh, my God!
And if he soft-shoes through the living room one more time singing "Red, Red Robin," I'm going to have to let him have it right in the beak.
: Oh, no.
Say, can I borrow your cruet set, too?
Sure.
And let's see your damask tablecloth and, uh And let me see and the napkins and and your silver carving set.
Why don't you just leave everything here and borrow the apartment?
I'm surprised you haven't asked me to dress up and go over and serve for you.
Well, for heaven's sake!
I didn't think you'd mind my asking you to Oh, honey, you know I don't!
Oh, I know you don't mind.
Of course not.
Let's see now, what else can I borrow that looks better than what I've got?
How about Ricky?
That's a thought.
Hey, you know, that's not a bad idea you had.
You can't have him.
No, no, I don't mean that.
I mean you dressing up like a maid and coming over and help me serve.
Oh, well, I'll see you later, dear.
You run along now.
You got a lot to do Oh, come on, now, Lucy, won't you do it for me?
No!
Why not?
I never asked you to do anything like this before.
Oh, honey, I can't do that!
What would Ricky say?
Ricky's not home.
Oh, come on now, you just got to do it for me!
I don't got to do it.
Well, think of all the hundreds of things I've done for you!
Oh, honey, I don't   Oh, funny.
Oh, weren't they wonderful folks?
That was a wonderful show, wonderful show.
Honey, what was the name of that mind reader?
Alexander the Great.
That's right.
Alexander the Great.
What a mind reader.
He could tell you anything about yourself.
Yeah, he could.
Barney, what ever happened to him?
Oh, he's working for the income tax department.
Barney, would you care for more beef?
Please, yes, please.
Bessy!
Madame rang?
Yes, madame did.
Mr. Kurtz cares for more beef.
Yes, ma'am.
Barney, tell us all about Europe.
Well, when I was making all those command performances before the crown heads of Europe, I thought of you both.
Oh!
Really?
Imagine playing before royalty!
Well, they're just like ordinary people.
They are?
Do they laugh and applaud?
I never will forget the first command performance in the London Palladium.
The London Palladium!
Gosh!
Yes, you know, I was, uh, oh, I was very hot that night.
You know, I kept it topical.
Yeah.
I said, uh.
"A funny thing happened to me tonight on my way to Buckingham Palace".
Buckingham Palace!
Buckingham Palace!
Bessy, you may bring the beef.
Yes, ma'am, I'll hustle it right up, ma'am.
Bring some more potatoes, Bessy.
Yes, sir.
And some green beans.
Yes, ma'am.
And some rolls.
Yes, sir.
And could I have a spot of gravy, please?
Yes, ma'am sir!
Well, Fred, you seem to be doing all right with a maid and everything.
Well, Barney, if I do say so myself, we're doing pretty well.
Good.
We own two a couple of other apartment houses besides this one.
And we have a part-time cleaning woman.
Yeah, and it's too bad our two cars are laid up or you could use the chauffeur.
Well, it couldn't happen to two nicer people and I'm happy for you both.
Oh, thank you, Barney.
It's so good to have you with us again.
You know what we ought to do, Fred, while Barney's here?
No.
We ought to get the old gang together and have a party.
Oh, that's Good idea.
Yeah.
very nice of you, but it can't be done.
I just about had enough time to visit you.
Oh You know I only have a few days, what with the booking agents, Mm.
the newspaper reporters, Mm.
and then I'm mapping out a new tour.
Yeah, Barney, I can see you're pretty busy all right.
Yes, indeed.
But it would be nice to see the old gang again.
Wouldn't it?
Flying Fly You know that Sliding Jim Crane?
Oh, Sliding Jim Crane.
Remember Kravetz and Lane?
Yes!
And the Shardi Sisters!
The Flying Harrisons!
Oh, how did you happen to remember the Flying Harrisions?

I'll, I'll get a cloth and wipe it up.
Oh, my!
Spit hot lead.
You know it's impossible to get good servants today.
I know how it is, yes, yes.
Oh, say, Barney, Hmm?
that's too bad, but, uh, are you going to be able to make Indianapolis on this trip?
I'm afraid not, no.
Oh, you're not going to Indianapolis?
No, no.
You're not gonna to see your daughter and your grandson!
Have you ever seen him?
Well, not since he was about a year old.
I told them that I couldn't make it this time, but I said, "The next trip, I'll come out there and I'll spend a lot of time".
That's good.
Oh, fine.
Barney, and speaking of Indianapolis, Yeah?
do you remember the night we broke our new act in there?
Do I?
Ho, ho.
Yeah.
With that big hit song we reduced?
"By Jingo".

Boy, I'll say they don't!
That is a real sensational number!
Boy, oh, boy.
Do you remember the night the fella fell into the orchestra pit?
Oh, no!
No!
Bessy!
Bessy!
Huh?
Oh.
You may serve the dessert.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Sorry, ma'am.
Oh, Ethel, have you seen Lucy?
Ricky, come on in and meet an old friend of ours.
Sure.
Ricky, this is Barney Kurtz.
Barney, this is Ricky Ricardo.
How do you do?
Glad to know you, Ricky.
Glad to know you, Barney.
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi.
Rather friendly, isn't she?
Uh, uh, uh, you may serve the dessert, Bessy.
Yes, ma'am.
Bessy!
Lucy, what are you doing in that getup?
Why, uh, she's kind of, uh, uh Oh, dear!
Oh, what's the use?
Barney, I might as well confess.
We really haven't got all the money I said we had.
This is the only apartment house we own and the bank owns most of it.
We can't afford a maid.
That's Lucy Ricardo, Ricky's wife.
They live right across the hall from us, our neighbors.
How do you do, sir.
I mean, glad to know you, Barney.
Glad to know you.
Oh, Fred, you didn't have to pretend with me.
Well, you being the big shot, I don't know Oh, nonsense.
Imagine you putting up a front for your old partner, Barney.
I guess it was kind of silly.
What do you say we all sit down and have some cake?
Oh, thank goodness!
My feet are killing me!
Hey, that cake looks good, huh?
Doesn't that look good?
Hey, Ricky, you should have heard the number Barney and Fred did.
It was so great!
Yeah?
Barney, would you and Fred do another one ?
Would you mind?
Would they mind?
Would a small boy mind going to the circus?
Well, we might be talked into it.
Remember the song we closed the act with?
Do I?
I want a girl just like the girl That married dear old Dad She was a pearl And the only girl that Daddy ever had A good old-fashioned girl with heart so true One who'll love nobody else but you, ooh I want a gal just like the gal That married dear old Dad.
I told you, Fred.
You can't fix that thing by just tightening it up.
You got to take that whole handle off to fix it.
All right, all right.
Now, you know all about it, you fix it.
Well, you're the landlord, aren't you?
You fix it.
Besides, I don't want to get my hands dirty.
Well, that's swell.
That's swell.
There now!
If anybody can open that door from the outside without a key, I'll eat it.
Oh!
oh, Fred.
Oh, hi, Fred.
We got a surprise for you.
Wait till you hear what happened.
What?
Wait till you hear.
We just had a letter from Barney's daughter.
Yeah, what is it all about?
Well, we had this idea We?
I had the idea.
Well, okay, Lucy had this idea to wire Barney's daughter and ask if the little grandson could come to New York and stay with us.
And surprise Barney!
Gee, that's a great idea!
Yeah.
When is he coming?
Oh, we got so excited, we didn't finish the letter.
"Thank you so much for your kind invitation "for little Barney to visit New York and see his granddad.
"He is all excited about seeing his famous grandfather perform during his New York engagement".
New York engagement?
Oh, she must have misunderstood.
"I'm putting him on the midnight train tonight "and he will arrive in New York Thursday afternoon at the Pennsylvania station at" That's today!
Why, sure it is!
Gee, won't Barney get a kick out of this?
I bet he will.
Somebody's here.
We'll have to pick him up.
Oh, eh, eh, B-B-Barney!
Hello!
Come on in.
Glad to see you.
Hi, Barney.
Glad to see you.
Oh, uh, Fred, I knocked on your door.
There wasn't any answer, so I came over here.
Well, sit down, Barney.
Sit down.
I've got something to tell you.
I should have told you before.
I, uh I'm an awful phony.
What do you mean?
Well, I haven't been in Europe all these years starring in vaudeville.
I've been living in New York.
I'm a cook in a restaurant up in the Bronx.
Oh, no!
Oh, my goodness.
This is terrible.
Now, I'm sorry I upset you.
Now, please don't be mad.
No, no, Barney.
We're not mad at you.
We'd never get mad at you.
It's just that when we found out you couldn't go to Indiana, we wired your daughter to send your grandson on to New York to stay with us.
Oh, no!
Oh, I have to wire them not to come.
It's too late.
He's on his way.
Oh Oh, this is a fine mess.
Yeah, Ethel, some lousy idea you had.
I had?
Okay, okay, doesn't matter whose idea it was.
Now, the point is that you've gotten Barney into a jam.
Now, we've got to figure a way to get him out of it.
Yeah.
Listen, Barney, could you get		Huh?
a couple of days off from the restaurant?
Well yes.
Now, listen, now you take a room at a hotel, show the little fellow around New York city and he'll never know the difference.
Yeah!
Sure!
No, no, no, it won't work.
Why not?
Because I haven't got a dime.
I've been sending all my money home for the little fellow.
I've been wanting to educate him.
Besides, I I told him I was performing in New York and I couldn't come to visit him.
That's what she must have meant in the letter.
Yeah.
I can explain to my daughter.
She'd understand.
But how am I going to tell little Barney that his grandfather, his famous grandfather isn't famous after all?
Just a has-been.
I had a friend of mine send him a lot of postcards from all over Europe.
The same ones they sent to you.
Mm-mm.
He wants to grow up and be like his granddaddy.
He thinks I'm kind of special.
Barney Hmm?
you're going to be performing when that little fella gets to New York.
What do you mean?
Where?
Ricky, tell him where.
Yeah!
Where?
At the Tropicana!
Yeah, at the Tropicana!
Sure!
Wait, wait a minute.
I haven't been on the stage in years.
I can't do anything.
Oh, honey, sure you can!
We'll all help you.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Oh, we'll do that old bathing bit that you did on the quayside.
That's a good idea.
There's a part in it for all of us!
Can I be in it, too?
Sure!
Sure!
Oh, boy!
Well, Barney, old boy, are you ready?
Is the show going to start now?
Right now!
Oh, boy!
Sit right there.
All right!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
If you're wondering why the Tropicana looks kind of different tonight, with a curtain and everything, it's because we're putting a very special kind of a show, featuring a very special kind of a gentleman.
He's an internationally famous entertainer, Mr. Barney Kurtz.
That's my grandpa!
That's right!
And here's our guest of honor, Barney's grandson, little Barney.
Let's give him a nice, big hand, everybody.
Yeah.
Take a bow.
Come on, take a bow!
Attaboy!
Well, you're really going to enjoy the show because his grandfather is going to do an act that he used to do with Fred Mertz about 30 years ago.
And in this act, they're going to be assisted by Lucy Ricardo, Ethel Mertz and yours truly.
So, here we go now to Atlantic City on the boardwalk!
Well, hello!
Hello, stranger!
Are you here for the convention?
For the dairymen's convention.
Good for you!
I'm from, uh, Wisconsin.
And I am from Illinois, sir.
That's a mighty nice part of the country.
What hotel are you stopping at?
Hotel?
I'm only going to be here three days!
Hey, you see what I see?
A couple of good-lookers.
Well, aren't they!
We came to this convention We didn't know a soul Headed for the boardwalk, going for a stroll Just a couple of visiting dairymen We were feeling lonesome when I found a peach on the beach at Atlantic City And there's a peach for each, and they are pretty Mother told us she would scold us If we spoke to a masher If you don't stop, sir, we'll call a cop, sir And he'll come on the run and settle your hash, sir.
Now have no fear, little dear, I've the best intention you'll hear no bum steer at the dairymen's convention It may seem bold, but it must be told You've got me dilly-dallied Give me a kiss, you'll never miss.
Sure!
Sure!
Saltwater taffy?
!
Taffy?
!
Ha, ha!
I found a peach upon the beach, the apple of my eye I'll cling to the peach I found on the beach Until the day I die I'd give up my money Oh?
Oh?
I'd give up my life!
Oh?
Oh?
For you, I'd even give up my wife!
Your wife?
Your wife?
If I had one.
If I had one.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, we'd make a pair, a wonderful pair We'd make a peach of a pair  Don't mean a lemon  We'd make a wonderful pair!
Well my little cutie, would you enjoy a mint smash?
Not on your tin type.
If you'll excuse us, we're going in bathing.
Well, do you mind if we join ya?
It's a free ocean!
This is the best convention I ever was to!
Me, too!
Ha, ha!
By the sea, by the sea By the beautiful sea You and I, you and I Oh, how happy we'll be When each wave comes a-rolling in We will duck or swim And we'll both have full a mouth of water!
Over and under and then up for air Pa is rich, Ma is rich, so what do we care?
I'd love to be beside her side by the sea Beside the seaside, by the beautiful sea.
I'd love to be beside Beside the sea, the seaside, by the beautiful sea!
I'd love to be beside Beside the sea, beside the sea Beside the seaside, by the beautiful sea!
Oh, look at his muscles!
Hey, hey, what's the idea?
!
We saw these cuties first!
Yeah.
Why don't you get a dolly of your own?
It isn't my fault.
What do you mean it isn't your fault?
I hate to talk about myself, but here's one time I must Your confidence I'll trust I have to speak or bust It's funny how I get the girls, I never try at all I seem to hypnotize them I'm bound to make them fall They go wild, simply wild over me  They go mad, just as mad as they can be  No matter where I'm at, all the ladies thin or fat The tall ones, the small ones, I grab them up like that Every night how they fight over me I don't know what it is that they can see The ladies look at me and sigh 	  In my arms, they want to die They go wild, simply wild, and they're hopelessly helplessly Frantic romantically, wild, simply wild over me!
On the boardwalk in Atlantic City I found what I waited for In romantic, enchanting Atlantic City Down by the old New Jersey shore.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Oh, boy, this kid's half-asleep already.
How you doing, Fred?
I'm pretty near through.
Hi, there, young fella.
You know what, I think I got something here for you.
Hi.
Hi.
How do you like that?
Garcie.
Oh, he said gracias.
No way.
He gets more like his father every day.
That was very nice, sweetheart.
He's a little Cuban dandy all right.
"Gracias".
Fred, I appreciate your concern over our safety, but you haven't worried about it for Why are you worrying now?
Well, that was Ethel's idea.
Oh.
She saw in the paper where some crook posed as a door-to- door salesman so he could get into apartments and then rob the place.
I read that.
I didn't think much about it.
Well, you know how she is.
One little thing happens, and she thinks the sky is falling.
Most door-to-door salesmen I've met are very honest.
Mm-hmm, well, I know it and you know it, but try and tell it to Chicken Little.
Oh, dear, what a gal, what a gal.
There we are, yeah.
There, now you got a brand-new, burglar-proof chain.
Thank you, Fred.
You just broke through Fred's burglar-proof chain.
Fred, can't you ever do anything right?
"Fred, can't you ever do anything right"?
You're not supposed to come charging in there like a bull out of a chute.
If you'd have fixed it right, it wouldn't have pulled out.
With your weight, you could come through that wall without a door.
Oh, keep quiet or I'll sit on you.
I'll go down to the basement and see if I can find some bolts strong enough to hold that against the charge of the heavy brigade.
Okay, Fred.
Do that, and fix every door in every apartment in this building.
: "Do that and fix every door in every apartment in this building".
I'm gonna do that.
How come you're such a scaredy-cat all of a sudden?
Oh, listen, people are going around, posing as all sorts of things just to get into apartments.
They posing as reporters and salesmen and who knows what.
Didn't you read this article in the paper this morning?
Yeah, I read it, but I didn't think much about it.
Well, I'm never gonna let anybody in my door again.
What happens if I want to come over?
What's the password?
Never mind.
You still want me to baby-sit while you go to the dentist?
The dentist!
I forgot all about the dentist!
Oh, for heaven's sake, it took me three weeks to get the appointment.
Oh, gosh, how do you like that?
I'll be back in an hour.
Okay.
I have read all of his magazines.
There, that ought to do it.
Oh, Fred, those big bolts look awful.
Can't you make it look a little neater?
What are you talking about?
A couple of dabs of paint and you'll never notice it.
Anyway, this protects you against anything.
Why be half-safe?
Oh Fred, it's stuck.
Fred Fred!
Fred!
!
!
What are you trying to do, be funny or something?
Lock that thing and then call me back?
I called you back to tell you that the lock got stuck.
It's impossible for that lock to get stuck.
Well, it did get stuck.
I couldn't open it.
Come on, I'll show you.
The lock can't get stuck.
Oh, humbug.
I'll go down and get some new tools.
Yeah, and fix it right this time.
This is a lot of protection.
Yes?
Good afternoon.
Is Mr. Ricardo home?
Why?
Well, I have an appointment with him.
Oh, you have?
Well, yes.
Are you Mrs. Ricardo?
Uh, who wants to know?
My name is Benjamin, Ben Benjamin, and I have an appointment with Mr. Ricardo.
Uh, well, uh, he's not at home right now.
But  Madam Would you mind if I come in and wait?
Yes, I would mind.
Who are you, anyway?
What do you want?
Well, I happen to be a talent scout for motion pictures.
A talent scout, ha!
That's a good one.
Well, now, look, lady, I am a talent scout.
That's a new one.
Nobody's I'm telling you, I have an appointment : Fred!
!
!
Stop your screaming, will you?
!
Cut it out!
Don't scream!
Oh, thank goodness, Lucy, you got here just in time.
He really tried to break in, huh?
Oh, I'll say he did.
He said he was a talent scout from Hollywood.
And you wouldn't believe that article in the paper this morning.
Well, I believe it now that I see what he did to that door.
Oh.
Well I'm going to call the police.
Yes, call the police.
Oh.
Hello?
Oh, Ricky, I'm glad you called.
Listen, something just What?
Well, well, honey, my-my news is important, too.
Now, listen, just well, I Oh, all right, go ahead.
A talent scout is coming here to see you this afternoon, and he's going to talk to you about a picture in Hollywood?
His name is Benjamin?
Um uh well, honey, don't worry.
I'll, I'll take care of him till you get here.
Yeah, good-bye What?
My news?
Uh, spilled the milk all over.
The baby, the baby!
Oh Ethel, what's the matter with you?
I'm sorry, Lucy.
No time to be sorry.
Ricky called from the drugstore down there.
He'll be here any minute.
What do we do with poor Mr. Benjamin?
Oh, set him up on there.
Oh, yeah, put him up on there.
He said he was a talent scout.
I didn't believe he was a talent scout.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Oh!
Shall we lie him down, Lucy?
No!
Sit him up.
Sit him up?
Why?
I don't want him to know that I'm the one that hit him.
It'll be the end of Ricky's career in pictures, to say nothing of mine.
Yours?
!
Now, listen, when he wakes up, we'll just be sitting here naturally, talking to him, you know, and-and we'll pretend we don't know what he's talking about when he says somebody hit him on the head.
That's a great idea.
Okay, all right.
Help me clean this up.
Oh, cleaning, oh, Lucy.
My gosh, look at this.
Couldn't you have got something else to hit him with?
Ricky'll think the baby did it.
Oh, dear.
Here, straighten out his hat.
Okay, straighten out his hat.
I'll hang up his coat.
Oh, good, right there on the stool.
Mr. Benjamin?
Where'd he go?
Mr. Benjamin?
Oh, he fell off again.
Oh!
: Oh Wait a minute, now, wait.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Oh, let's see, now.
Uh, let's see Let's make him look kind of natural.
Let's see there, yeah.
Let's see if he smokes.
Yeah.
His hair's mussed up.
Comb his hair.
Comb his hair.
Hey, Lucy, look.
Was it parted in the middle?
It was parted on this side.
Hurry up.
The hair looks better than when he came in, huh?
Okay, sit down.
Sit down!
Sit back and relax.
Oh, okay.
Oh, my dear, do you mean to tell me that Elizabeth Taylor looks just as pretty off the screen as she does on?
Huh?
You were saying, Mr. Benjamin, that Elizabeth Taylor looks just as pretty off the screen as she is on, is that right?
Uh yes.
Yes.
Oh, well, I'm so glad to hear that.
I like to hear nice things about Hollywood.
Who are you?
Who am I?
Oh, surely you must be joking, Mr. Benjamin or my name isn't Lucy Ricardo.
Oh, so then you're Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, you silly boy, of course.
I don't understand this.
When I came in  What's the matter?
I have an awful headache.
Oh, too bad.
Look, when I first came in here, didn't you scream and Scream?
Why, why should I scream?
Uh, you know, dear, you did call me.
You said, "Lucy"!
And then I came out and hung up Mr. Benjamin's coat and hat and, uh, since then we've just been sitting here having a delightful chat with you, Mr. Benjamin.
Hi, honey.
You really Oh, hi, dear.
Mr. Benjamin came in right after you called.
Oh, he-hello, Mr. Benjamin, how are you?
All right.
Well, good-bye, Mr. Benjamin.
It's just been delightful talking to you.
Good-bye.
Thank you.
Eh, Mr. Benjamin, my-my agent says that you want to see me about a screen test.
A screen?
Oh, oh, yes, yes.
Our-our studio is making a picture about the life of Don Juan.
Don Juan!
Oh, Ricky, that'd be just perfect for you.
Spanish and everything.
Lucy Yes, dear.
Mr. Benjamin, that-that sounds very, very exciting.
Is it going to be cinemascopee and stereonophic?
I beg your pardon?
Is it going to be cinemascopee and stereonophic?
Uh uh Mr. Benjamin, I think he means "cinemascope" and "stereophonic".
That's what I said.
That's what he said.
Oh.
Probably, I Oh, that's good.
You know, I'm sorry, but I don't feel very well.
I have an awful headache.
Oh, that's too bad.
Look, I, uh, I have a script here with me.
There's a scene in it here somewhere that's marked.
You can find it.
If you'll just read that over and I'll be back in a couple of days.
You can read it for me, and then if it sounds all right, we'll give you a screen test.
Well, that would be wonderful, Mr. Benjamin.
I'm awfully happy to have met you, Mrs. Ricardo.
Thank you.
I'll get your coat, sir.
I'll be seeing you, then, in a couple days.
Yes, sir.
Okay, Ricky.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Bye.
He's nice fellow.
Too bad he's got a headache.
Well, those things come on you, you know.
Sometimes you just don't know what hit you.
Yeah.
That's too bad.
"Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.
"Would that I had the power to tell you what is in my heart tonight".
"Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.
"Would that I had the power to tell you what is in my heart tonight".
Would that you had the power to read that speech right.
What's wrong with it?
The same thing I've been telling you all day.
You're just too stiff, Ricky.
You have to loosen up.
Relax!
Not that much.
Don Juan was a man, not an ape.
Now, look, you're getting me all mixed up.
I am not.
It's just that you can't just stand there and just say the words.
In pictures, you have to be a personality.
You have to develop a distinctive way of talking like Humphrey Bogart.
Oh!
Oh, yeah, I see what you mean.
: "Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one".
"Drop the gun".
Oh, now, stop.
Now you know what I mean.
Look, will you leave me alone?
I've been in show business a long time.
Doesn't make you an actor just because you've been shouting "babalu" and beating on a cowhide.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?
I don't have to be Sarah Bernhardt to tell you a few things!
Hey, what's going on?
What's the matter?
Oh, I'm trying to make an actor out of him, but he just refuses.
She keeps telling me to do things that I know are wrong.
They are not!
Well, what do you want him to do?
Well, for one thing, I'd like him to develop a distinctive way of speaking.
Ricky?
!
Ricky?
!
You know what I mean.
I'll show you what she wants me to do.
Go ahead, sit down, I'll show you.
Sit down, honey.
Huh!
Here's what she wants me to do: "Would that I could ask you to fly with me "for I know that you are devoted to your husband, Count Lorenzo".
"It is you I love, my lover.
"You are so young and strong, but he is old and feeble and he needs me".
"But for him, I will sweep you into my arms "and carry you over yon garden wall.
Oh, my heart my poor, poor heart".
"What of your heart"?
"It sinks".
That's not the only thing.
Now, you shut up.
I told you it was lousy.
Oh, I don't think you should've taken her on your arms like that.
Ricky, I've been in show business a long, long time.
If you'd take a little advice from people who've had a lot of experience All right, all right!
You're not doing what I told you.
All right, already!
Will you please do me a favor and leave me alone?
Oh, now, Ricky.
I want to do it my way.
Oh, fine.
: "Would that I had the power to take you and fly over yon garden wall".
Right?
That would be great.
I was just trying things out.
That's not the way I'm going to do it.
Yeah.
Now, out, everybody.
Oh, Ricky Maybe if you can take a little advice Please go play cards or something.
I got a lot of work to do now.
Will you please go and play cards?
Thank you very much.
Can't do it like "Babalu".
Thank you very much for your interest.
Phew!
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
"Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.
"Would that I had the power to tell you "what is in my heart tonight.
"Would that I could ask you to fly with me "but I know that you are devoted to your husband, Count Lorenzo.
"But for him, I would sweep you into my arms "and lift you over yon garden wall.
"Oh, my heart, my poor, poor heart.
To think it can never be one with yours".
No, no, I'm sorry, Mrs. Sawyer.
Yes, dear, it's true.
A talent scout is coming over tonight, but it's only to listen to Ricky.
No, I'm sure he wouldn't be interested in your French poodle.
You see, this is a Spanish picture.
Yes, that's right.
Okay, good-bye.
Hi.
Honestly, this has been going on all morning.
What has?
People calling up and wanting to audition tonight.
No kidding.
How did they find out?
I don't know.
I didn't tell anybody-- did you?
Certainly not.
I didn't tell a soul and they all promised to keep it a secret.
You know, I never knew this neighborhood was so full of frustrated performers.
At last I found out where vaudeville went to die.
Oh, no!
Now, who is this?
Oh, Mrs. Trumbull.
Hello, Mrs. Ricardo.
I'm returning that cup of sugar that I borrowed from you.
Oh, fine.
Well, come in and sit down.
: Ah, sweet mystery of life At last I've found you Ah, at last I know the meaning of hope Oh, the yearning, seeking, striving Mrs. Trumbull, dear  Did you by any chance hear that a talent scout was coming here tonight?
Yes, I did hear a little rumor.
Yes.
Well, you have a very lovely voice, dear, but this gentleman is coming here tonight just to hear Ricky read for the lead in Don Juan.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
That's right.
Mrs. Ricardo, I'll just take back that sugar.
Oh.
Oh, I thought you were returning it.
Oh, I didn't really owe it to you.
That was just a ruse.
Oh, oh.
Ah, sweet mystery of life At last I've found you Isn't she a doll?
She sure is.
Oh, the back door.
Next they'll be coming through the windows.
Oh, hi, Pete.
Hi, Mrs. Ricardo.
Hi, Mrs. Mertz.
Oh, uh, say, Mrs. Ricardo Before you say another word, Pete, it's a Spanish picture and there is no room in it for whatever you do.
What are you talking about?
I was just going to tell you we're all out of melon.
Oh, I'm sorry, Pete.
It's just that everybody in the neighborhood has been calling up and wanting to audition for a talent scout that's coming here tonight.
Oh, I hadn't heard a word about it.
Well, good.
But now that you mention it, I do play the trumpet.
Just forget it.
But Mr. Ricardo, when I play the trumpet, I'm real gone.
Then go, man, go.
Honestly.
Isn't it awful?
After all, Ethel, if there are any extra parts in that picture, you and I could certainly Ethel, what's wrong with us?
!
I don't know.
Cast of characters-- I never even thought to look at it.
No.
"Don Juan, the count, the countess"-- they'll be the stars.
Now, look, here, here we are.
"Isabella, a beautiful peasant girl, a Marilyn Monroe type".
That's perfect!
Of course.
Is there a part for you?
I was referring to me.
You?
I'm the blond in this group.
Well, I could be a blond as easy as you can.
Oh, now, listen, the minute you said it was a Marilyn Monroe She has a way of carrying herself and a way of smiling.
Hey, what's the beef?
Wait, here's Fred.
We'll let him settle it.
Fred, I think I look more like Marilyn Monroe than Lucy does.
And I think I look more like Marilyn Monroe than Ethel does.
What do you think?
I think I look more like her than either one of you.
Oh, Fred, you're a big help.
What's all this about, anyway?
Well, we were just looking at this script and there may be parts for all of us in it.
And one of them is a Marilyn Monroe type.
Now, so I said I'd Oh, for Pete's sake, can't you two let Ricky do one little thing without horning in?
Can't you live your life without putting your nose in Part for all of us?
Now, look, Fred, Fred, you were right.
You were right.
This is Ricky's big chance and I think we should keep completely out of it.
Huh?
Don't you, Ethel?
Uh oh, yeah.
Yes.
Yes, we'll let Ricky do this all by himself.
Yes, this is Ricky's big day.
Let's let him have it, huh, okay?
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Lucy?
Lucy?
I'll be right there.
Hey, what time is that talent scout supposed to arrive?
Lucy said he'd get here around 7:30.
Sit down.
Hey, who are you supposed to be?
Guess.
Humphrey Bogart in a wig.
What are you two all dressed up for?
We're a Spanish dance team.
All right, okay, hold it.
I thought we all agreed that you weren't going to do anything to ruin Ricky's chance.
Well, you're ruining it.
That's different, I'm his wife, I have a right to ruin it.
Well, that's a pretty selfish attitude to take.
Where is Ricky?
He's down picking up Mr. Benjamin.
Now, listen, you two, get out of here.
There he is.
Sit down and be quiet.
Pete, Pete!
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you supposed to be?
Gorgeous George.
Now, look, Pete, there's no point in your  There he is.
Sit down and be quiet, will you?
Ay-ay-ay-ay Ay-ay-ay-ay Canta y no llores Porque cantando se alegran Mrs. Trumbull Cielito lindo Mrs. Trumbull, the talent scout isn't here yet.
Oh, nuts.
Now, listen, everybody, there's no  La, la, la, la la, la, la, la Hold it, hold it.
Hold it, hold it!
Hold it!
It's the phone.
Hello.
Honey, guess what happened.
What happened?
He's gonna give me a screen test.
Well, what do you mean?
Mr. Benjamin isn't even here yet.
I know, I read for him at his hotel.
At his hotel?
Yeah.
He said he had a terrible headache.
Has he still got a headache?
Isn't that wonderful news?
Honey, I got the screen test!
Yeah, honey, wonderful.
Anything new at home?
No, dear, everything here is about as usual.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
You are going to learn to sing and dance and act, and then when Daddy takes us out to Hollywood, we're going to be a big star, too, just like Jackie Coogan, huh, honey?
Now, first you have to learn how to dance.
Now, you watch Mama.
Hey, watch me, watch me.
Come on now, watch.
First you're gonna learn how to dance.
Now watch.
Da, da, da, da, da, ta, ta, ta Da, da, da, da, da, da Da, da, da, da, da, ta, ta, ta!
Now, come on, you try it, huh?
You try it.
Oh, just try.
Come on now, try.
Da, da, ta, da, ta Da, da, ta, da, ta Da, da, ta, da, ta Oh, come on, honey, just try to dance, huh?
You won't dance, huh?
Well, dancing isn't so important.
It's the acting that counts, huh?
Let's try the different emotions, shall we?
Now, first, sadness.
You are sad.
You are so sad.
You lost your lollipop.
That's good, that's good.
Yeah, that's good.
You won't dance, though, huh?
I don't understand it, Ricky.
Both your parents are so talented.
Well, hey, wait a minute.
Maybe if you put on a funny hat, you'll go into your stuff, huh?
Oh, come on, honey.
Okay.
You want to go out and play with Mrs. Trumbull?
All right!
Okay, honey.
Well, yeah, you'll find your place in show business, huh?
Yeah.
Well, we'd love to come to your party, Marge, if we're still in town.
Oh, haven't you heard?
Yeah, Ricky's going to Hollywood and be a big movie star.
Lucy Yeah, yeah.
They're giving him a screen test this week, and then he's gonna sign the contract, and California, here we come!
Well, sure, you can visit us, Marge.
Sure!
Well, we'll talk to you before we leave.
Bye!
Honey, why do you keep telling people that we're going to Hollywood when you know it's not definite yet?
Well, it will be.
Now, look, the screen test might not be any good.
Aah!
And even if it is, I still might not get the part.
Oh!
And then, and then ev-even if I get the part, there're still a lot of things that can happen to keep me from being a Hollywood star.
Now, look, you're just being negative.
I believe in positive thinking.
You're going to take Hollywood by storm.
Well, look, ju-just forget the whole thing, will you?
If it happens, all right, but until then, let's not count on it.
All right, dear, anything you say.
Good.
Where do you think we ought to live?
Hollywood or Beverly Hills?
I was merely asking.
Well, this is hardly the time that we have to decide that.
Yeah, you're right, it doesn't matter where we live.
The important thing is to find someone that can build us a swimming pool shaped like a conga drum.
Hi!
Hi.
Hi, Ethel.
Did you bring your bathing suit?
Huh?
Lucy just invited us all to go for a swim in our pool.
Oh, is she still entertaining in her Beverly Hills mansion?
Go, ahead, laugh.
You two have no vision.
I can see us out there in Hollywood now, dining in famous restaurants, rubbing elbows with movie stars, Ricky putting his footprints in the cement in the forecourt at Grauman's Chinese Theatre.
She's been out in that California sun too long.
Gee, it'll be such fun dropping into Romanoff's or the Derby and seeing all the old gang.
Hi, Bing!
Oh, Luella, darling!
Oh, Hedda, I adore that hat!
Hi!
Hi!
I brought back the butter I borrowed.
Thank you.
Come here!
I want to show you something I found in this movie magazine.
What?
A map of Hollywood showing where the.
all the stars live and guess what.
What?
There's a vacant lot right next to Clark Gable's.
Lucy, I haven't got time for this.
All right, but when you come to visit us, I won't let you borrow butter from Clark.
Where's the lot?
Right here.
Now, look, all the stars live in this section, see, and that's where we're gonna have to live, too, honey.
Oh, Lucy!
Do you really think you're gonna get to go?
I have no doubt of it!
We were meant for Hollywood, Ethel.
It's sort of, sort of our destiny.
Yeah.
Hey, maybe Clark will let Ricky ride to the studio with him every morning.
Oh, honey, movie stars don't ride to work with other movie stars.
They don't?
No.
we'll get our own big, yellow Cadillac convertible.
Oh, pardon me!
Alan Ladd lives right here.
Yeah.
Alan Ladd!
Hey, look, look!
Ricky made front page in Variety!
No kidding!
Yeah.
"Ricky Ricardo, local nightclub entertainer, "is testing for the lead in Don Juan.
"Studio heads revealed today "that the Latin American conga beater seems to have the inside track for the role".
What did I tell you?
We're as good as in Hollywood right now.
"The studio is earmarking $3 million "for the budget for the star-studded color spectacle".
Color!
$3 million!
Maybe we'll have two Cadillacs marked "his" and "hers".
"The studio plans to select a newcomer like Ricardo "for the lead and build him into a star.
He will be surrounded by big-name performers".
Oh, isn't that wonderful!
"Being considered for top female roles around him "are Marilyn Monroe, Ava Gardner, Jane Russell, Yvonne DeCarlo, Lana Turner, Arlene Dahl, Betty Grable" Oh, boy!
What a lineup!
I say!
Hey!
Hey, did you read Variety?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They say I got a pretty good chance.
And what a cast!
Nothing but cuties and beauties!
Yeah, I know.
They say I got the inside track!
Oh, Ricky, this is so exciting!
Y-You know, for the, for the first time, I-I'm beginning to feel like Lucy does, you know, that we're really destined to go to Hollywood!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Honey, I think that your instincts are very good!
Yeah, well, uh, Ricky Yeah, honey?
You know, you, uh, you have a very steady following here in New York.
Do you think it's wise to give up a sure thing for the uncertainty of a film career?
Huh?
Lucy, I thought you were dying to go to Hollywood and rub elbows with the stars.
Yeah.
Well, it's an awful lot of wear and tear on your elbows.
What about me putting my footprints in Grauman's Chinese Theatre?
Get your shoes all covered with wet cement?
Nah.
What about living next door to Clark Gable?
Now, don't tell me that's bad.
Well, Ethel, look at it this way.
Suppose you do borrow butter from Clark.
What good will it do you?
He'll give you one look and it'll melt right in your hand.
I don't get it, Lucy, why the big switch?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I think I know.
Would this change of heart have anything to do with, uh Marilyn, Ava, Jane, Yvonne, Arlene and Betty?
Certainly not!
And you left out Lana.
I thought so.
The green-eyed monster.
Oh, Lucy, the paper said they were just considering those girls.
Yeah, well.
In other words, you just as soon I didn't get the part, huh?
Well frankly, yes.
Oh, Lucy, how small can you be?
!
Well, I just can't help it!
Well, honey, if you really feel that way, then it's no use going through with the screen test.
Lucy, you're not gonna let him give up his big chance?
Of course she isn't!
Aah!
I'll call Mr. Benjamin and I'll tell him that I'm not interested in going through with the screen test and neither are you.
Well, I think that's better, Ricky.
I I think that that's the only What do you mean, neither am I?
What do you mean, neither am I?
!
Well, I Well, no use telling you now.
Tell me what, tell me what, tell me what!
Well, it's just that the girl that was supposed to do the test with me got sick, and Mr. Benjamin asked if I knew somebody who could take her place.
So what'd you tell him?
What'd you tell him?
I told him you've been reading the part with me and you knew it cold and he said you'd be fine.
He did?
Yeah, but if you don't want me to do it, I'll call him Honey, wait just a minute now.
Wait just a minute now.
Let's, let's not be rash.
A-After all, dear, this-this is your big chance to go to Hollywood.
No, honey, I think you're right.
After all, I got a steady following and a sure thing right here in New York.
Yeah, well, th-that's just it.
You're in a rut, a big fat rut!
An-And I think what you need is the, is the, is the, th-the challenge of-of an unknown field.
The next sound you hear will be Clark Gable opening his refrigerator.
Now, honey, I want you to be absolutely sure because the only thing that is important is where we'll be the happiest.
Oh, honey, how can there be any doubt of it?
Who wouldn't love to go to Hollywood?
Dining in famous restaurants, mingling with celebrities and don't you worry, dear, I'll wipe that cement off your shoes before it dries.
Ethel, will you answer that door?
I'm busy.
Busy?
Doing what?
Reading.
Oh, honestly!
What are you made up for, Lucy?
Oh, darn it!
You recognized me!
What is this, trick or treat?
How'd you know who it was?
Well, for one thing, I've seen that old link stole every winter for the last eight years.
Oh, dear.
Well, if I hadn't worn this, would you have known who it was?
Of course!
What are you trying to prove?
Well, I was just practicing.
You know, us movie stars have to go around disguised or our fans will mob us.
Why, if it isn't Lucy Ricardo.
Gee, can I have your autograph?
Oh, Fred, don't be smart.
Who's being smart?
I want it on a check for this month's rent.
You'll get your money, my good man.
Us movie stars always pay our bills.
Hey, wait a minute.
I thought Ricky was gonna be the star.
Oh, he'll be one, too, don't worry.
Too?
Yeah.
I was just thinking.
Do you know what's liable to happen with that screen test?
What?
I'm afraid to ask.
Well, now, it just might happen sort of like this.
We make the test here in New York.
They send it out to the coast.
They show it at the studio.
My face comes on the screen just for an instant, but that's enough.
The head of the studio sees it.
He jumps up and shouts: "That face!
That face!
Get me that girl"!
"Sir, she's an unknown, a nobody".
"I don't care; find her.
"Get that girl!
I want to make her a star"!
And the rest is motion picture history.
Ethel, that girl could be a second John Bunny.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Rick.
Oh, there you are.
I came home early; I want to go over that scene that What's all that?
That's Lucy's disguise so her fans won't know she's a star.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
You know, Fred, I married a bird.
: Yes.
She's just supposed to help me out in this screen test and she's already a big movie star.
Well, don't hold your breath, honey.
Apparently, you're not up on your motion picture history.
What are you talking about?
Well, the way I hear it Come on, dear, let's go do that scene.
Just a minute, please.
Come back here.
What are you talking about, Fred?
Well, the way I hear it, the head of the studio sees your test, discovers Lucy, he demands to know her name and a new star is born!
So, that's the way it's gonna happen, huh?
I didn't say it would happen; I said it might.
Well, it could happen.
Better not happen?
Look, Lucy, there are a few things that you ought to know.
First of all, this test is for me.
You're just there to feed me the lines.
Nobody's going to see any more than the back of your head.
Now, I'm going to go home and get into some comfortable clothes and I'll 'spect you there in five minutes to go over that scene.
Huh!
"I'll "spect" you there in five minutes to go over that scene".
"You're just there to 'fid' me the lines".
"No one's going to see anything but the back of your head".
Huh!
That's what he thinks!
Lucy, what are you going to do?
I don't know, but the back of my head isn't going to take this lying down!
Yes?
Now, Ricky Ricky, we'll shoot the song part of the test first.
Okay.
Are the guitar players close enough for balance?
I think so, yes.
All right, I'm ready.
: Quiet on the set!
This is a take!
: It's all yours, sir.
Roll 'em.
: Roll 'em!
Speed!
Ricardo's song, take one!
Action.
Bajo el manto plateado de un sombrero Cordobes Unos ojos van brindando la ternura de un querer Unas guitarras morunas dejan sus notas sonar Y unos ojos aojarenos que fascinan al mirar  Ah-ah, ah-ah Ah-ah, ah-ah Canta, canta guitarra Canta guitarra mia Canta, guitarra agarena Canta guitarra bravia  Canta, canta guitarra Canta guitarra mia Canta mi guitarra siempre Que en tus besos tomo mi vida  Ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah Canta, canta guitarra Canta guitarra mia Canta guitarra agarena Canta guitarra bravia  Canta, canta guitarra Canta guitarra mia Canta mi guitarra siempre Que en tu boca tomo mi vida, ole!
Cut!
Print that.
Print it, the first take.
Ricky, perfect.
Now we'll do the scene.
All right, thank you, boys.
Thank you very much.
All right, get Mrs. Ricardo.
Yes, sir.
Now, Ricky, when you kneel down at the end of the scene, you know, make a more dramatic wave with the hand when you say, "So, I'm afraid that we must say farewell," and then make your exit.
Oh, I see.
Okay.
Uh, Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, oh, is that the camera?
Yes.
Mrs. Ricardo Yes, sir.
We'll rehearse it once more before we shoot.
Action.
Hark!
Do I hear a footfall?
Is that you, Don Juan?
Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.
Would that I had the power to tell you what is in my heart tonight.
What do you mean, my dearest?
I have come to say farewell.
No, say not so.
Would that I could ask you to fly with me, but I know that you're devoted to your husband, Count Lorenzo.
Yes.
Much as I love you, I must stay with him.
He is old and feeble and he needs me.
But for him, I would sweep you into my arms and carry you over yon garden wall.
Oh, that I could cut these ties that bind me.
Do not cry, my dearest.
It was not meant to be.
I had no right to win your heart.
I had no chance to win your love.
So, now I'm afraid I must say farewell.
Cut!
That's fine, Ricky, fine.
Good feeling.
Thank you.
How was I, sir?
Very good, Mrs. Ricardo.
Thank you.
Oh, Ricky, now, be careful so that your wife doesn't get in your way in front of the camera.
Just take a step to one side.
All right.
Well, I think we're about ready for a take.
Now, let's see if we can't get this the first time, everybody.
Now, may I have it quiet, please?
: Quiet on the set!
This is a take!
: It's, uh, all yours, sir.
Uh, Mrs. Ricardo.
Roll 'em.
: Roll 'em!
Speed!
Ricardo test, take one!
What was that?
!
Cut!
What was that?
!
That's just what we have to do at the beginning of a scene.
Oh.
Now Now, please, Mrs. Ricardo.
Now, uh change the slate.
All right, I'm ready.
: Quiet on the set!
This is a take!
: It's all yours, sir.
Roll 'em!
Roll 'em.
Speed!
Ricardo test, take two!
Action!
Hark!
Do I hear a footfall?
Is that you, Don Juan?
Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.
Would that I had the power to tell you what is in my heart tonight.
What do you mean, my dearest?
I have come to say farewell.
No, say not so.
Cut!
Lucy, what's the matter with you?
Mrs. Ricardo Yes, sir?
Is that as far as your head turns?
Yes.
Why?
What a pity.
I thought it might lend interest to the scene if you could keep it going around and around like a lighthouse!
Oh  I don't recall telling you to look over your shoulder.
Oh, no, sir, that was my own idea.
Did you like it?
No!
Oh.
Now, let's just do this the way we rehearsed it.
Yes, sir.
Let me check this setup again.
Lucy, what are you trying to do?
Well, I was just thinking, the back of my head is not my best side.
That's only one person's opinion!
All right, now, places, everybody!
All right, I'm ready.
: Quiet on the set!
This is a take!
: Yes, sir.
Roll 'em.
Roll 'em!
Speed!
Ricardo test, take three!
Action!
Hark!
Do I hear a footfall?
Is that you, Don Juan?
Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.
Would that I had the power to tell you what is in my heart tonight.
What do you mean, my dearest?
Would that I could ask you to fly with me.
But I-I know that you're devoted to your husband, Count Lorenzo.
But for him, I would sweep you into my arms and carry you over yon garden wall.
Oh, that I could cut these ties that bind me!
Cut!
!
Well, we can't use the scene, but it was a lovely mazurka!
I'm sorry, sir.
My wife doesn't seem to understand.
Well, I hope she catches on this time because this is going to be the last take!
Why, you running out of film?
No.
No, we're running out of chalk!
Oh.
Now shall we do it for the last time?
Look, I'm sorry, sir.
You want to get another girl?
You expect me to go around looking for another girl with a whole crew sitting around here getting paid!
No, no, no, sir, no.
No, we should put a three-inch lens on, then we'll take it with that!
Now, this is the test that's going to Hollywood.
Yeah, well, I-I-I got, I got an idea that this time it's going to be right!
All right.
Now, this is it, good, bad or indifferent!
: Roll 'em!
Roll 'em, I said!
Oh.
Roll 'em.
Roll 'em!
Speed!
Ricardo test, take four.
Action!
Hark!
Do I hear a footfall?
Is that you, Don Juan?
Yes, it is I, oh, lovely one.
Would that I had the power to tell you what is in my heart tonight.
What do you mean, my dearest?
I have come to say farewell.
No no, say not so.
I am sorry, my dear, but this is the way it has to be!
Would that I could ask you to fly with me, but I know that you're devoted to your husband, your husband, Count Lorenzo.
Yes, much as I love you, I must stay with him.
He is old and feeble, and he needs me.
But for him, I would carry you over yon garden wall and lift you over the wall.
Oh, that I could cut these ties that bind me.
Do not cry, my dearest.
It was not meant to be.
I had no right to win your heart.
I had no chance to win your love.
So, now I must say farewell!
Cut!
Okay.
Okay, that's it.
What do you mean, that's it?
You're not gonna send that to Hollywood?
Don't worry, I had a close-up lens on you.
All we ever saw was your face.
Didn't see your wife at all.
You sure it was all right?
Sure, it'll be fine.
Okay, everybody, that's it, wrap it up.
You hungry, Ricky?
Yeah.
Put on your pants and I'll buy you some lunch, come on.
Okay.
Well, hey, wait for me!
Wait for me, Mr. Director Man!
Uh, Ricky Ricky, it was only a joke!
A big joke, Ricky!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Bim bam boom, bim bam boom La mula Va bailando detras del Bim bam boom.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Thank you, my devoted public.
What brings you down here this time of day?
Hollywood called!
I got the screen test!
No.
Hollywood called, and I didn't get the screen test?
No, Hollywood didn't call.
It has nothing to do with the screen test.
Oh.
I just happened to be downtown shopping and I thought I'd drop by and bring you a letter that came this morning.
Oh.
It's special delivery.
I thought it might be important.
Well, that's very sweet of you, honey, but you could have called me over the phone and read it to me.
Please, I do not approve of reading other people's mail.
Oh.
Besides, it was all in Spanish.
Oh, it's from Mother.
Oh, what does she say?
Oh, isn't this wonderful!
What?
"Por fin, voy a poder hacer "el viaje a los estados unidos "Si todo sala bien, "saldre por avion la semana entrante y si no te es inconveniente "me gustaria hospedarme en tu casa por unos cuantos dias".
Isn't it wonderful?
!
Wonderful!
What did she say?
I forgot.
Well, she's finally coming to visit us!
She is?
Yeah.
She is?
What's the matter, honey?
Oh, gee, I-I'm kind of afraid to meet your mother after all these years.
Oh, now, don't be silly.
She says she'll be here next week sometime.
She'll wire us to tell us the exact time.
Ricky?
Yeah?
Do you think she'll like me?
Oh, honey she'll love you just as much as I do.
I hope so.
: Sure.
Mr. Ricardo Say, Professor Permission to audition the act?
Yeah.
We're ready anytime you're ready.
Thank you.
Okay.
Who's that?
Oh, a Professor Buonanova.
He's got a mind-reading act, and we might use him at the club.
Does he really read people's minds?
So he says.
Presenting Professor Buonanova, mind reader extraordinaire.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Hear, Hear!
Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness the most amazing mind-reading feat of the century.
And now I'd like a volunteer from the audience, please.
Oh, thank you, madam.
Me?
Go ahead.
Now what's the date of your birth?
August 6.
August 6, what?
August 6, period.
Oh, won't you tell me the year, too?
He's the mind reader; let him tell you.
Professor I'm thinking of a date.
A date A date The date is the sixth of August.
Why, Rick Oh, you told him when my birthday was.
No, honey, I just met him.
Go on now, you told him.
Let's try something else.
Tell me something that no one else could possibly know.
All right.
I know something that even Ricky doesn't know.
A nickname when I was in grade school I'm thinking of a name, Professor.
A name A nickname One she used when she was in grade school.
Th-The name is Bird Legs!
Why, that's fantastic!
Did you hear that?
Well, honey, push your eyes back into your head.
He wasn't really reading your mind.
But he knew all those things!
Of course.
I know.
They do it, uh with electro-knicks.
"Electro-knicks"?
I think he means electronics.
Oh.
Yeah, that's it.
That's what I said.
Yes, we do the act with a shortwave setup, you see?
Here is the receiver.
And I have the microphone here.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Then he really heard what I tol oh.
Of course.
Isn't that clever?
Well, Professor, that's a wonderful act.
We'll buy it.
You can start tomorrow night.
Fine.
Muchas gracias, Senor Ricardo.
Muy respeto, Gracias.
Senora.
Adios.
Aren't they great?
They sure are.
Ricky?
Yeah?
You really think your mother will like me?
Of course she will, honey.
She'll love you from the top of your pretty red head to the bottom of your skinny bird legs.
Oh!
Hi.
Hi.
"Carne de puerco con chile vurdy".
What are you doing?
I'm going through this Cuban cookbook.
You know, according to Ricky, his mother thinks I'm the best cook and housekeeper in the whole wide world.
Oh, brother.
When is she coming?
I don't know; she's gonna wire us ahead of time.
Well, when do you start the housecleaning?
Oh, I wasn't going to do anything special.
The apartment's all clean.
Honey, your mother- in-law is coming!
Stand by for dust inspection.
Oh, Ethel, you don't think Ricky's mother is coming all the way up from Cuba just to check on my housekeeping?
Why not?
Fred's mother comes all the way from Indiana once a year just to look under my rug!
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Oh, brother, if I thought she'd stay home, I'd send her the rug and a box of dirt.
Oh, I don't think Ricky's mother is like that.
Honey, a mother-in-law is a mother-in-law.
Don't take any chances.
You know what she'll do.
She'll open every drawer, She'll go through all the closets.
She'll go under the bed, over the transom, all around the picture frames.
Oh, Ethel I'm telling you.
Really?
Mm.
Ethel!
What?
Where's my lunch?
I'm coming.
I got to go.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy, she's here!
She's here!
Who's here?
!
Ricky's mother.
I just saw her getting out of a cab.
H-H-How do you know it's Ricky's mother?
She tried to pay the cab driver in pesos.
And she looks like those pictures you showed me.
Well, here, help me put this stuff back in the closet.
: Oh Oh, that's the way it always is.
They tell you they'll let you know when they're coming, they never do!
: Until you find out Oh, for heaven's sake!
I didn't expect her for a week!
Oh, it'll always be like this.
All right.
Okay.
Whoa!
Push, you push!
I'll hold it.

Well, I tried ?
Cuando llegaste?
Has she seen the baby?
Yeah.

Huh?
Oh, oh, isn't this wonderful?
The three of us finally got together.
Yeah.
Come on, sit down, sit down.
Let's, let's, let's get to know each other good, huh?
Oigame, tu no sabes lo contento que estoy.

Cuando llegaras?
Aterrizamos a las dos.
Mande un cable de Havana pero llego despues que yo.

El cable llego despues que tu?
El cable llego despues que tu.
Listen.
How do you like ?
Como te gusta ?
Como te gusta mi mujer?
?
Como te gusta Lucy?
Dile a Lucy que es exactamente lo que esperaba.
Mother says that you're just the way she pictured you.
Well, thank you.
You tell her She's just like I pictured her, too.
She looks just like you.
Lucy dice que tu y yo nos parecemos.
Gracias.
Mother says, "Thank you".
You are welcome.
Lucy dice, "No hay de que".
Dile a Lucy que mi nieto parece un angelito.
Aw.
She says that little Ricky looks just like an angel.
Oh gracias.
Lucy, uh, Lucy says, "Thank you".
You are welcome.
Mama dice, "No hay de que".
I got my fingers crossed.
I'm talking to you in Spanish and talking to mother in English.
You got your wires crossed.
My wires or something crossed.
I don't know what it was.
Hey, what's burning, honey?
My-my dinner.
Your dinner?
What happened?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Uh-oh.
Oh, no, don't tell me Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh Look at it!
Ay, que lastima, Lucita!
But that's all right, honey.
We'll eat it anyway.
It's just little charcoal taste, that's good.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you doing tonight?
Nothing in particular.
Why?
Want to run away with me?
Run away?
What's the matter?
Oh, Ethel, I haven't done anything right since Ricky's mother came to visit us.
Oh, honey, you have, too.
I have not.
The day she arrived, the apartment was a mess, my hair was up in curlers, the closet exploded in her face and I burned the dinner.
Yes, I know, hon.
And then the next day, I took her shopping and I lost her in the subway.
But someone turned her in to lost and found.
Sure.
She must think I'm an awful dope.
I wouldn't be surprised if she had our marriage annulled.
Nothing that's happened has been your fault.
Now, you march back in there and you No, I can't.
Why not?
Well, his his mother has some friends coming over to see her tonight and I offered to press her dress for her.
Well?
After the annulment, you can come and live with us.
I didn't mean it, honey.
I was only joking.
Please, don't make jokes.
You're the only English-speaking friend I've got.
Oh, honey I just wish there was some way that I could walk into that group tonight and start speaking Spanish.
Well, you could always give the party down at the United Nations and use their earphones and an interpreter.
Oh, sure.
Oh, honey, you got to get hold of yourself.
I never saw you so upset.
Hey!
What?
You have given me a tremendous idea!
Oh, honey, I'm sure the United Nations has more important things to do.
No, no, there's a new act down at the club and they use hidden earphones and a hidden microphone.
I could, I could borrow the earphones and somebody could be in the kitchen, telling me what to say in Spanish!
Don't look at me.
I don't speak Spanish.
No, no, but that professor does!
I'm going to call him and ask him if he'll help me.
Ricky and his mother went down to pick up the guests.
They're not back yet.
Mm-hmm.
Now, look, can you see that?
No.
Does it show in my ear?
No, no, no.
It's all right.
Can you see the wire?
No, I don't.
Okay.
It's fine.
But are you sure Mrs. Mertz will let me know if my if my phone call comes in?
Oh, sure, she'll tell you as soon as she gets it.
Oh, fine.
What's so important?
Well, it's my daughter.
Tonight I may become an abuelo!
A what?
Abuelo.
Grandfather.
And I want to know when it happens.
Well, of course you do.
Congratulations.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
She'll call you.
Now, you watch through here, listen to what they say and tell me what to say in Spanish.
Don't worry.
Go slowly.
Go slowly.
Oh, yes.
Want to try it once?
Yeah.
Okay, say something.
Muy bien, gracias.
Muy bien, gracias.
Hey, that's perfect.

Hi.
Where have you been?
Well, I-I was out taking a Spanish lesson.
Spanish lesson!
Uh-huh.
I want to be able to talk to your mother and her friends.
Well, honey, that's awfully sweet, but I don't think you can learn in one lesson.
Well, I don't know.
I learn pretty fast, you know.
Well, I want you to meet our friends.
Quiero que conocen con mi senora, el Senor y Senora Ollas.

You come right in here.
Look, I don't get this.
You don't speak Spanish.
Well, the professor was here, but he had to go away.
Oh She was only doing this so your mother would like her better.
Adios.
Now, what what are you trying to do?
Well, I I I just wanted ?
Que estas haciendo, Ricky?
Mama, Lucy estaba conectada aqui con este microfono y el Profesor Buonanova le estaba traduciendo todo para ella poder hablar con ustedes alla.

She think that you're just wonderful to go through all this trouble just to please her.
Oh, gracias, mamacita!
Mi Lucita!
Oh, gracias!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Ahh!
Ethel, what's the matter with you?
Are you crazy or something?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Come sneaking in on somebody like that.
Well, I wanted to be sure Fred wasn't here before I came in.
Well, for heaven's sake, why?
I want you to help me with something.
What?
Well I don't know whether I mentioned it or not,  But I've got a birthday coming up this week.
Oh, did I mention it?
Only about 18 times in the last three days.
Oh.
Well, Fred doesn't seem to have gotten my message.
Where has he been, underwater?
Will you help me?
Well, okay.
I just hope he gives you something nicer than he gave you last year.
Wasn't that awful?
You know, I never did figure out what that was supposed to be.
Neither did I. It was too long to be a stole and too short to be a volleyball net.
You know, on second thought, Ethel, maybe we'd better keep Fred from finding out it's your birthday.
No, I'd rather have a terrible present than no present at all.
You're right, it's not the gift that counts, it's the lack of thought behind it.
I'm glad you're gonna help me.
Hey, why don't you and Fred come over for dinner tonight.
We'll both work on him.
and I'll be real subtle, see?
Oh, that ought to do it.
Thanks.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
All right.
Good.
You want some more cake, Fred?
No, thanks.
Um, speaking of cake, did you all see the huge birthday cake that was in the window of the Speedy Cleaners?
It was the Speedy Cleaners' 40th birthday.
Mm-hmm.
Oh and I didn't send them anything.
Goldblatt's Delicatessen had a birthday last week.
It was their 50th.
It just seems like everybody in the neighborhood is having a birthday.
Let's see, who else do we know that has a birthday about this time?
Can I have another cup of coffee, Lucy?
Yeah.
You know, I have the strangest feeling that someone we all know and love has a birthday coming up very soon.
Someone's going to get clobbered if he doesn't remember.
Excuse me, please.
Want some sugar, Fred?
No, thanks.
Cream?
No, thanks.
Happy birthday, sweetheart!
You thought I'd forgotten, eh?
My birthday is months from now.
Oh?
She was talking about Ethel's birthday.
Oh, Fred, you knew it all the time.
Sure.
Why did you let us keep on talking?
Yeah.
What's the matter with you.
, Fred?
I just wanted to see how far you two clowns would go.
I'll put this away.
Just a minute.
How come you have this box of candy all ready to give to me?
Well, uh And with a card that says "Happy Birthday"?
Ricky?
Well, uh if you must know this is my emergency present.
Emergency present, huh?
"Happy Anniversary".
"Happy Mother's Day".
"Happy Valentine's Day".
"Merry Christmas".
Oh, and here's a pip.
"I'm sorry, dear.
Can't we please be friends again"?
Well, I'll I'll put it away.
Why?
I certainly won't be surprised next time.
You might be.
These chocolates are three years old.
That's great, Rick.
I'll have to remember that gag.
Honestly, these men.
What, uh, birthday is it, Ethel?
Ethel, what birthday is it?
Oh, it's mine.
I meant, how old are you gonna be?
She know what you meant.
Ricky Ricardo, I'm surprised at you.
It's not nice to ask a woman's age.
Thanks, Lucy.
Besides, it's none of your business if Ethel is 53.
I am not!
I'm only Oh, no, you don't.
Ha, ha!
Darn it, it almost worked.
Ah, you think you're so smart.
I'll never tell you my age.
I'll tell you.
Fred Mertz, don't you dare.
Go ahead, tell us.
Fred!
Nah, honeybunch, I'm not going to tell them your exact age.
Let's just say it's somewhere between the Speedy Cleaners and Goldblatt's Delicatessen.
Well, so long as you know I got a birthday coming up, where had you planned to take me to celebrate?
Well, I loved what we did last year, honeybunch.
What was that, Fred?
Well, we just had a cozy little dinner at home, just the two of us.
That's sounds very romantic.
Oh, it was.
I bought the groceries, I cooked the dinner, and by the time I finished washing the dishes, he was in front of the television set asleep.
Happy birthday to me.
I tell you what let's do this year.
Let's all go someplace for a fancy dinner and then go to the theater and see a play.
Oh, that'd be wonderful.
Would you like that?
I'd love it.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
Fred, it'll be our present to Ethel.
It's on us.
Yeah.
Hey, that is a pretty good idea.
Oh, what a sport I married.
Okay, then that's all settled.
Come on, let's play cards.
That was quite a game.
Yeah.
Thanks for a wonderful dinner, Lucy.
You're welcome.
And, Ricky, thanks in advance for dinner and the theater on my birthday.
That's a wonderful present.
Well you're welcome.
Hey, Fred, you know a present you can give me sometime?
What?
You can fix that leaky faucet in the kitchen.
Oh, how long has that been leaking now?
Four months now.
Ah, don't worry.
I'll get around to it in due time.
Oh, swell.
Come on.
Good night, Rick.
Good night, honey.
Good night, Rick.
Good night, honey.
Good night, Fred.
Good night.
Oh, honey, I'm real tired.
I think I'll go to bed, huh?
Okay.
I'll be right in.
Fred.
Now, where's that little old leaky faucet?
At this hour?
Well, it was on my mind.
This is just an excuse to get away from Ethel.
Oh, oh, oh.
Will you do me a favor?
Sure, Fred.
I want you to buy Ethel's present for me.
Oh, sure, I can, but why don't you want to do it?
Well, she doesn't seem to like the presents I buy.
What makes you say that?
Well, I've been buying her presents for 26 years now, and after I give them to her, I never see them again.
Well Now, you buy her something real nice, will you?
With this?
Well, all right.
Okay, did she give you any hints about what she wanted?
Well, she did say this morning she needed a new toaster.
Oh, Fred.
Women don't like practical gifts like toasters.
They like something that's feminine and fun.
You know, a gifty gift.
Well, I'll leave the whole thing to you.
Oh, all right.
I'll go shopping tomorrow.
I'll get her something real pretty, huh?
Thank you, honey.
Good night.
Good night.
Forgot my wrench.
Hey, uh, as long as you're here, how about fixing the faucet?
At this hour?
Are you crazy?
Psst, Fred, Fred.
Hi.
Shh.
Oh.
: There.
Well, hi, Fred.
Hi, Lucy.
Hey, Ricky got tickets for Over The Teacups.
I don't believe it.
He did; go on up and see him.
Here I go.
Ethel?
Yeah.
Hi!
I thought I heard your voice out here.
Guess what play Ricky got tickets for.
What?
Over The Teacups.
Over The Teacups!
Oh, that's the biggest hit in town.
How did he do that?
Well, he said he had to pull a lot of strings, but nothing was too much trouble for your birthday.
Oh, he's a dear.
He's a real Cuban doll.
This is gonna be the best birthday of my whole life.
Dinner and a hit play.
Oh What's the matter now?
I haven't got a thing to wear.
Oh, come now, Ethel.
Surely you must have something.
Well, I got a dress that would do, but my coat's so tacky.
What coat do you usually wear?
Yours, but you're going.
What about that gold lame jacket of yours?
You mean that green lame jacket of mine?
Tarnished?
It's tarnished.
Maybe you can get it dry-cleaned.
Or I could polish it.
Ha, ha!
You wouldn't believe what that old coat looks like.
I'll show you.
You know how many years I've had it anyway.
Hey.
What's this?
What's what?
This.
Oh, it must be Fred's present to me.
How do you know?
He always hides them in the closet.
Must be something to wear.
Uh, well, Ethel, uh aren't you going to peek inside and see what it is?
No, I want to postpone the bad news as long as possible.
Well, uh, Ethel, may-maybe Fred got you something nice this time.
Let's look.
Well all right.
Maybe if I get the initial shock over with, I can act pleased when I open it in front of Fred.
Yeah.
Well, he's done it again.
What do you mean?
Oh, these make his other presents look great.
Well, Ethel, I-I think they're kind of cute.
What are they?
Well, they're hostess pants.
You wear them when you give smart dinner parties.
Oh, I was wondering what to wear at all those smart dinner parties I give.
Well, I-I saw them last month in Harper's Bazaar.
Well, they're certainly bizarre.
Well, now, wait a minute, Ethel.
Look.
You get yourself a little black, off-the-shoulder blouse and a big crushy belt and little ballet slippers and you're all set.
What for?
Halloween?
Well, I like them.
I think this time Fred made a very good choice.
Oh, don't try to defend him, Lucy.
Let's face it, all of his taste is in his mouth.
Ethel, I think you're being very ungrateful!
Fred pro-probably put a lot of time and thought into picking these out.
He did not.
I know where they came from.
What I can't figure out is how they got them to fit in a box of Crackerjack.
You know, these are so ridiculous, they're funny.
Oh, brother.
I'd like to meet the idiot that talked him into these.
How do you do.
How do you do.
What do you mean?
For your information, I am the idiot who talked him into those.
Oh, Lucy!
Oh, Lucy, I don't believe it.
I should have known more than to get you something chic.
Chic?
I got no use for those.
I wanted a toaster.
Well, Fred told me that, but I couldn't believe you could be that dull.
Listen, I'd look better wearing a toaster than I wear those checkerboard britches.
I should have known better than to get you anything at the young, modern department.
Well, you're so young and modern, you wear them.
Well, I would, but first, I'd have to take them in six inches in the seat!
Oh!
Well, honeybunch, you're going to the theater for your birthday.
Yes, sir, it was tough, but we got the tickets.
Well, you little Dickens, you've opened your present.
What did I give you?
I mean, how do you like what I gave you?
Oh, it's not use, Fred.
I know Lucy picked them out.
You should have stuck with your own taste.
You see, I told you we should have bought the toaster.
Is this what you bought for Ethel?
You keep out of this!
Well, this is a switch.
You open your present, find out you don't like it, and now you can exchange it before I even give it to you.
Yeah, this way, everything works out perfectly.
Yeah, but I'll bet you won't want to exchange these.
No, I won't because we're not going to accept them.
What?
I refuse to go to the theater with anyone who thinks I'm a hippopotamus.
Did you call her that?
No.
Ha!
All I did was intimate that she was a little hippy.
But on second glance, she has got the biggest potamus I've ever seen.
Fred, give him back those tickets.
Are you crazy?
They cost $6.60 apiece.
I don't care if they cost $660.
We're not going.
Well, I am.
Well, take somebody else.
Hey, there's an idea.
Oh, no you don't.
There.
We offered you theater tickets and you're going to take them.
We're not going.
What?
!
I have no intentions of going to the theater with someone who thinks my taste is all in my mouth.
Pardon me.
Happy birthday, and I hope you live another 75 years.
Oh!
Hi, Rick.
Hi, Fred.
There-- Ethel won't use these tickets.
Oh, that's too bad.
Did you ever see anybody as stubborn as that old mule of mine?
Well, Lucy does pretty good.
She wasn't gonna go if Ethel was going.
Well, I'll let you know how the play turns out.
You won't have to.
Ethel's got this thing stuck in her craw.
She's got to go to this play on her birthday and I've got to buy some other tickets.
You can't buy any other tickets, Fred.
It's a sellout.
Hey, wait a minute.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
What?
Here.
You pay me for these and you tell Ethel that you bought two tickets.
What about Lucy?
I'll tell Lucy that you gave me your tickets back and I sold them.
That way, they'll both agree to go.
Mm-hmm, well, what are you gonna do about our two mules sitting next to each other?
Put blinkers on them?
You know how they are.
By tomorrow night, they'll be the best of friends.
They can't stay mad at each other.
You're right.
Sure.
I'll go and tell, uh, Francis I bought the tickets.
Okay, Fred.
See you later.
I guess it's right here.
Loge seats!
Yeah.
Second and third in.
Pardon me.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Say, these seats aren't bad, considering how tough they were to get.
Wasn't that a break they had a cancellation just as you got to the box office?
Yep, yep.
You didn't see Lucy at all today, huh?
I saw her; I didn't speak to her.
Uh-huh.
I thought probably you'd made up.
You two are pretty good friends, you know?
Eh.
Let me look around, huh?
Oh, isn't this thrilling?
People who come to the theater always look so intellectual and well-groomed.
Present company excepted.
I wonder who those two people are.
Oh, I hope they don't come in late and crawl all over us.
If there's anything I can't stand, it's people who come in late and crawl all over you.
Quiet.
Curtain's going up.
Pardon, please.
Good afternoon, Cynthia.
Lucy!
Good afternoon, sir.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Shh!
Go in, go in, honey.
I thought you said you took those two tickets back.
I thought you got our tickets at the box office.
Shh!
I thought you'd be friends by now.
Well, we're not.
Go in, honey.
No, I'm not going in.
Go on, lady.
I can't hold this all night.
Shut up.
Shh!
Well, I'm going in.
I don't care.
Just sit down.
Sit down.
Well, John, to what do I owe this visit?
Oh, nothing.
An important man like you : Let me see, Fred.
One lump or two?
Three.
WOMAN : You're not fighting weight like most of us, I fear.
The cookies are delicious.
Ricky?
Would you like I would.
Fred, can I look through your binoculars?
: I don't care!
Why do you have to be so selfish?
Just let me   I never see you anymore.
I've been awfully busy.
Nonsense.
Your problem is that you have too many friends.
Nobody ever has too many friends.
Friendship is a terribly important thing, Cynthia.
As a matter of fact, friends are about the most important thing in the world.
Ha!
friendship, Cynthia.
Don't let a friend get away.
You'll be sorry.
That's a hot one.
I'd like to hear this play if you don't mind.
I'll tell you, Cynthia Who's stopping you?
You are, by talking so much.
Shh!
Shh!
I've got just as much right to Oh, no, you haven't got just as much right Yes, I have Ouch!
Would you please sit down and stop making so much noise?
I told you you were talking too much.
I wasn't talking any more than you do.
At least when I talk, I say something.
We're switching.
We're switching.
Oh, we are?
Well, I'm glad.
Sit over here while I sit over here.
Sit there.
I lost my shoe.
What?
My shoe.
Your shoe?
There's your shoe.
I got it.
I got it.
That's right, I'll see you Monday.
Now, John, what were you saying?
Well, it's about your friend, Marie Van Schlieg.
She is no friend of mine.
What about her?
What about her, John?
We just got a cable from the Riviera where she's been vacationing.
Yes, this country isn't good enough for her.
Well, what about her?
She's dead.
Dead?
I I don't believe it.
: Marie gone!
Cynthia, Cynthia, you've got to get hold of yourself.
You don't understand.
Marie and I are friends.
Only now she'll never know it.
Oh, John, we had a little quarrel.
I said some terrible things, unforgivable things.
Oh, I'll never forgive myself.
We quarreled over some silly little thing.
I don't even remember what it was.
Don't blame yourself too much, Cynthia.
I should have been bigger.
We were both too proud to say "I'm sorry".
Oh, what wouldn't I give to see her one more time.
Just once more to tell her I'm sorry.
Oh, what a lesson I've learned, John.
If only the whole world could learn never to quarrel with a dear friend.
And if you do, don't let foolish pride keep you apart.
Hold her in your arms and tell her you're sorry.
Lucy!
Ethel!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, it was all my fault.
No, it was my fault.
Will you two please sit down.
We're, we're very sorry.
Well, that's all right.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Good morning, Lucy.
Hi.
Hi.
I'll get the rent money.
How did you know what we wanted?
Listen, there's just one thing that'll put a smile like that on Fred's face.
Now, Fred, this is my big day.
I get to hold some money for a few minutes.
Oh.
That's long enough.
Any word?
Not yet.
I wonder why.
Who knows.
How's he?
Just awful.
No kidding.
Getting worse.
What are you talking, shorthand?
Pay attention.
I was asking her if Ricky had heard from Hollywood about his screen test.
Oh, that's right.
Any word?
Not yet.
Wonder why.
Don't know.
Too bad.
Aah, you got me doing it now!
You know, that talent scout made a big, fat mistake.
Mr. Benjamin?
What did he do?
Oh, he told Ricky that he'd hear from Hollywood in a couple of weeks.
It's been more than two weeks now and Ricky's absolutely frantic.
Yeah, that wasn't so smart.
Ricky's got nothing to worry about.
He's a cinch to get that contract.
I wish he was as sure of that as you are.
You'll see.
Oh, I got to go and put this away.
See you later, honey.
Okay, dear.
What was that all about?
Oh, he's gone to put the money in his secret hiding place.
Do you mean to tell me he hides that money someplace and doesn't tell you where it is?
That's right.
Why, I should think that would drive you crazy.
It used to.
But confidentially one day I took the whole house apart and finally found the secret hiding place.
Good girl.
How long have you known?
Ha, ha!
Gee, I'm sorry Ricky's so upset about not hearing from Hollywood.
Yeah, we were talking about it last night.
He says this whole thin' has him on pins and niddles.
Aw And you should see the way he is about that telephone.
He even takes it to bed with him.
No kidding.
Yeah.
Breakfast is ready, dear!
Lucy!
Yeah?
Oh.
I'm sorry, dear.
Hi, Ricky.
Good morning, dear.
Well, here's the morning paper.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Honey  The rest you'll have to do yourself.
I'm not hungry.
Aw, come on now, you have to eat something.
You didn't eat any dinner last night.
I can't help but I can't eat until I find out about this thin'.
Hello?
No, she's not here.
Who's not here?
You.
Who was that?
!
Caroline Appleby.
No wonder I haven't been getting any calls for a couple of days.
Have you been telling everybody I wasn't here?
I got to keep this line open.
How about that?
I've been cut off from the world.
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Ah, Rick, here's your mail.
Oh!
Nothing from Hollywood.
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?
I trust you.
You'd think they'd let me know.
I've been waiting over two weeks now.
What are you kicking about?
I've been waiting to hear from Hollywood for 30 years!
Here's your mail, Lucy.
Oh, is there anything for No.
He's in bad shape.
And getting worse all the time.
The poor thing's about to explode.
Well, he just can't go on like this.
We're gonna have to do something to get his mind off it.
What?
Well, why don't we go in there and just sort of be gay, you know?
Tell him funny stories, make him laugh.
It won't work.
It might.
It's worth a try.
Come on.
All right.
Hi, Ricky.
Hi, Rick, ol' pal, what's new?
Hi, Ricky!
Uh, did I tell you the funny thing I heard on television the other night?
No.
What was it?
Well, this fellow was big game hunting in Africa, and he shot an elephant in his pajamas and this dumb girl said, "Well, how in the world did an elephant ever get into your pajamas"?
That's kind of funny, Rick.
Please, not on an empty stomach.
Well, uh, I heard a funny one last night, Rick.
Uh, uh uh, comic on television, he was giving the weather report and he said, uh, "Tomorrow, muggy, "followed by 'tueggy,' 'weggy' 'thurggy,' 'friggy' and 'saggy.
'" : "Saggy"!
Why, that's  funny, Ricky.
You think it's out of order?
He didn't even hear you.
I heard him.
"Muggy, tueggy, saggy" : Very funny.
Well, uh, how about this one?
Uh.
there was a fella, see, a a traveling salesman, and, he, uh, he comes up to this farmhouse Fred!
Well, it's the only one I can think of.
Um did you ever see my imitation of a Pekinese?
A Pekinese?
!
Yeah.
Oh!
Want to see it?
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Isn't that funny, Rick?
You know what always makes me feel good when I'm down in the dumps?
What?
No.
A community sing.
That's a Yeah.
swell idea!
Good old community sing, yeah.
Shall we sing?
Yeah.
Okay.
What do we sing?
Uh, how about "When You're Smiling"?
Okay.
Good.
Oh, when you're smiling When you're smiling the whole world smiles with you.
Everybody sing!
When you're happy Oh, when you're happy The sun keeps shining through And when you're crying Da, da, da, da And when you're smiling Everybody sing!
When you're smiling Oh, when you're smiling The whole world smiles with you Ricky Ricky, why don't you do something?
Why don't you go someplace?
Now, why don't you go down to rehearsal?
Oh, I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't want to Oh, look, I promise, I'll call you the minute I hear anything, huh?
Word of honor?
Word of honor.
Now, go on, go on, scat, scat.
Go on, Rick.
Now, be sure you call me.
Now, how can you call me when you don't even have the phone here?
!
Are you going to skip your number?
No, no, we'll do my number.
But it's such a bright number and you feel so lousy.
Never mind the way I feel.
Just play the music, I'll sing the song.
Not so far from here, there's a very lively atmosphere Everybody's going there this year And there's a reason The season never closes there Love and music you'll find everywhere People always having fun down there, so come along.
I'm on my way to Cuba That's where I'm going  Cuba, that's where I'll stay Cuba, where wine is flowing And where dark-eyed Stellas light the fellow's panatelas Cuba, where is all happy  Cuba, where all is gay Why don't you plan a wonderful trip To Havana, hop on a ship And I'll see you in C-u-b-a!
Why don't you plan a wonderful trip To Havana, hop on a ship And I'll see you in C-u-b-a!
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I'm just baby-sitting until she gets back from the beauty parlor.
Okay, I'll leave a message that you called.
Good-bye.
Hello.
No, she's not home.
No, nothing's wrong, dear.
It's just that Ricky hasn't let her use the phone for a few days; he's expecting an important call.
Lucy's quite a talker, you know, especially when she gets wound up with one of her gabby friends, like Caroline.
I'll leave a message you called, Marge.
Oh, Caroline!
Oh, uh Well, I'll leave a message that you called, Caroline, dear.
Ethel, aren't we ever gonna have lunch?
It's just a little after 12:00.
But we always eat at 12:00, and my stomach's growling.
Well, tell your stomach, lunch is gonna be a little late today.
Did you hear that, Charlie?
Oh, now, Fred, I'm baby-sitting.
I can't leave till Lucy gets back.
And brother, I hope it's soon.
I'm getting writer's cramp.
All those people that Ricky hung up on finally got through.
Look at the messages.
Isn't it a shame one of these isn't from Hollywood?
Yeah Wait a minute.
Wait a ding-dong minute.
Give me that pad.
What are you gonna do?
Just watch the old mastermind.
What are you doing?
There.
"Hollywood called-- you got the job".
What do you think?
I think the old master has lost his mind.
Don't you get it?
We'll leave it for Lucy, she'll call Ricky, tells him the good news, he stops worrying, and everything is rosy.
Especially your nose after he hits you.
Oh He's gonna get the job-- he's a cinch-- and when the real news comes, he'll thank us for saving him all these hours of worry.
Well, supposing he doesn't get the job?
But he will.
Well, supposing he doesn't?
Oh, well, anyway, he's been a moving picture star for two or three days and that's something.
No, Fred.
Oh, Ethel Give me one good reason.
Well, first of all, it sounds like one of Lucy's ideas, and second Hold it.
That's enough for me.
Look, why don't you go on over and fix yourself a couple of sandwiches.
That'll tide you over till lunch.
You're the cook in our family.
I'm gonna wait for you.
Okay.
Hello.
Hi, Sue.
No, she isn't here.
Okay.
What's your number?
Oh, just a minute.
Hi.
What's that number?
Circle-seven-2099.
Wait a minute, here she is.
Oh, boy, am I glad you're back.
This phone's been ringing off the hook.
You've got a thousand messages.
Who's this?
Sue.
Oh, thanks.
I'll see you later.
I gotta go fix fatso some lunch.
Okay.
Thanks, Ethel.
Hi, Sue.
Oh, yeah, I know.
Isn't it awful?
Ricky wouldn't let me talk on the phone.
Well, he's at rehearsal now.
We got time for a nice, long chat.
Oh, really?
Tell me all about it.
Uh-huh.
No kidding.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Really?

I don't believe it.

Oh, how wonderful.
Oh oh, this is wonderful.
Ricky, Hollywood called and you got the job!
Oh, isn't it wonderful, honey?
I love you.
What, dear?
Well, who is this?
Oh.
Well, well, Marco, Marco, be sure and give him the message as soon as he comes in.
It's very important.
Have him call me, huh?
Well, you remember Mr. Benjamin, the talent scout?
Yeah, well, the whole thing happened when Mr. Benjamin arrived here Honestly, of all the dumb ideas, wanting to leave a phony message.
All right, all right.
How about a little less gab and a little more grub?
In the first place, it's terribly cruel and in the second place In the second place, why don't you keep quiet in the first place?
Okay.
Here you are.
Now, I don't trust you.
Give me that message.
I haven't got it.
Give me that message!
I want to tear it up before someone sees it by mistake.
But I don't have it; I gave it to you.
You didn't Oh, that's right and then I Oh, no!
Now, what, dear?
Oh, I must have left it by the telephone!
Come on!
No, you go ahead.
I want to eat my lunch.
I want you to be with me.
In case she's already seen it, then you can help me explain.
Come on.
Patience, Charlie, patience.
Yeah.
Well, you be sure and have him call me, huh, Marco?
It's very important.
Bye.
Oh, boy, isn't that wonderful!
Oh!
Lucy Oh, are you the sly one, Ethel Mertz!
Uh.
Oh, what a sense of humor, letting me find this message all by myself!
Oh, honey, isn't that wonderful?
Uh Hollywood!
Hollywood!
Oh, we're gonna have a great big house and we're gonna give great big parties and we're gonna invite lots of movie stars and we're gonna have a big, splashy swimming pool and there I am, in my mink bathing suit up on top of the high diving board Lucy, don't dive in!
Huh?
There's no water in the pool.
In fact, there's no pool.
What are you talking about?
Well uh You tell her, Fred.
Ethel, what's the matter?
Uh Fred wrote that note.
Oh, did Fred answer the phone?
No.
Uh Lucy, there was no call from Hollywood.
What?
!
It was just an idea I had.
I thought if we gave, uh, uh, Ricky some kind of a phony message that, uh, he'd stop worrying and then when the real message came Oh, no!
I told him it was a lousy idea.
I took the note and I was gonna tear it up, and by mistake, I left it by the telephone.
Can you ever forgive us?
No!
Now, listen, it could've been worse.
You might've called Ricky.
Yeah Ricky!
Ricky!
No, you didn't!
Oh, I did.
He wasn't in, but I told Marco to give him the message.
Oh, no.
Marco, remember what I told you about Hollywood a few minutes ago?
Well, listen.
What?
Oh.
Well, Mr. Green, wh-where is everybody?
He did?
Oh.
Oh, no.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah, we're very happy about it.
Yeah, good-bye.
What happened?
Ricky's taken the whole band over to Lindy's to celebrate.
Oh		 Oh This is awful.
You bet it's awful!
And it's all your fault.
How could you do such a stupid thing as write that?
!
Now, don't try to pin it onto me.
It was Ethel's fault.
She left it here.
It is not my fault.
No, Fred, it's your fault.
How could you do that?
!
I didn't know what I was doing.
I was half-crazed with hunger.
Oh, Fred I told you it was your fault.
Oh, never mind, Ethel.
Doesn't matter whose fault it is.
It's done.
Now, the important thing is, which one of you is gonna tell Ricky?
Come on, Fred, I'll fix you some more lunch.
All right.
Oh, no, you don't!
You're gonna stay right here and face the music.
Not me.
Why not?
You did it.
Okay.
Tell him I did it.
First he'll have to find me.
Me, too.
Wait a minute.
How come I get left holding the bag?
I didn't do anything.
Well, that's life.
Come on, Ethel.
All right, all right.
I'll tell him.
Really?
If you stay here and give me moral support.
Okay.
Of course, when I tell him, I'll be holding little Ricky.
He wouldn't hit a woman with a baby in her arms.
Oh, that's a great idea.
I'll just say, "Ricky, it's all a mistake, dear.
"You didn't really get any call from Hollywood.
"Fred wrote the note and Ethel accidentally left it here and I innocently called you"  Now, wait a minute.
I'll stay on one condition.
What's that?
When you come to "Fred wrote the note", you hand me the baby.
And then when you get to the part, "Ethel accidentally left it by the phone" and you hand Never mind, never mind.
Just forget all about the baby.
Now, look, crazy things like this happen.
Ricky's just gonna have to accept it.
Now, the three of us are gonna stay right here and tell him exactly what happened, okay?
All right, sit down.
All right.
Now, look, there's nothing to worry about.
We're just gonna tell him the truth.
Just sit back and relax.
Sit back and relax!
Oh, I wonder what's keeping him.
Maybe he hopped a plane to Hollywood?
No.
Now, listen, when he does come in, try to act natural.
Don't, don't act as though something terrible has happened.
Oh, no, we won't.
We'll be   Why is he ringing the bell?
Maybe it isn't Ricky.
Oh, you're right, you're right.
Hello, baby!
Well, we finally made it.
We're gonna take Hollywood by storm.
Ha, ha, California, here I come!
How do you like it, huh?
Uh Isn't this the most, huh?
Yeah.
Um Ricky?
Yes?
Uh, w-w-we three have something to say to you.
Yes?
I, uh I really don't know how to say it.
Well I'll say it for you.
I know what you want and the answer is yes.
You three want to organize my first fan club.
The Ricky Ricardo Fan Club Number One.
Yes, you may have the sharter.
How-how about that?
We got the sharter.
Well, I guess there's only one thing to do.
What's that?
I'm gonna get my autograph book.
Oh, me, too!
Uh uh, excuse me, star.
Where are you going?
To get my autograph book.
I left it in Indiana.
You can't leave now.
We have to tell him.
I can't tell him.
He looks just like Buddy Rogers.
Oh Now, listen, either we all march in there together and tell him the truth or I'm gonna tell him that you wrote the note and that you left it there purposely!
Now, do we march?
Forward, march!
Ricky Yes?
We three have some Excuse me.
Get back here.
Now we're going in there again and this time you're gonna march in front.
Now march!
Forward, march!
Pretty, eh?
Ah, this is just the beginning.
Wait till I get to Hollywood.
I'm gonna make that Crosby look like a bum.
Ricky, I-I-I can't stand anymore.
What-what's the matter, honey?
What can't you stand?
Uh, about that message I left for you at the club Oh yes, darling.
I-I should apologize for that.
I-I meant to call you, but well, I got carried away.
After I talked to Mr. Benjamin, I took all the boys down to Lindy's to celebrate.
Yeah, well, that's just it.
Mr. Benjamin?
You talked to Mr. Benjamin?
!
Yeah.
He wanted me to ask you something.
He had only gotten the wire 20 minutes before.
How did you know?
Well, uh Have you got a friend at the telegraph office?
Good!
Yeah.
Yeah!
Yeah, that's it.
I-I got a friend at the telegraph office.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, we really did hear from Hollywood today.
We heard from Hollywood!
We heard Get up!
We heard from Hollywood!
We heard.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi there.
How's the baby?
He's fine.
We played for a couple of hours and then he went to sleep.
Oh, good.
Wait till you see what I got.
Lucy What?
You didn't buy more clothes?
Didn't I?
Now, look, honey, I'm only going to do one part in one picture, and we're only going to be in Hollywood one month.
Exactly.
We're going to be there a whole month.
It sounds different when you say it.
Wait till you see the wonderful bathing suit I got.
Look.
That's real cute.
You like it?
Yeah.
You want to see how it looks?
Now wait just a minute, honey.
Don't wake up little Ricky just to try a bathing suit on him.
Little Ricky?
This is for me.
What?
!
Usted no se puede poner ese traje de bano en ningun lugar del mundo!
How dare you say whatever you said!
Look, no wife of mine is gonna be seen wearing that thing.
All right, I'll take it back.
Okay.
I can't afford to argue with you till we get out there.
What's all that?
Travel folders.
Trying to figure out which is the best way to go.
You know, we've got to save as much money as we can on this trip.
Well, movie stars always fly.
I'm not a movie star yet.
Let's not spend the money before we make it.
I was undecided between the bus and the train.
Well, I don't know It's better for the baby.
It's the quickest.
He'll sleep the whole way.
Well, that's true.
Look here.
"Special facilities for the baby.
Family plan.
Your wife and children can fly for half fare".
Well, I I guess it'll be better for the baby.
Why, sure.
Well, you'd better make reservations, too.
Good flights are hard to get on.
Okay, I'll call them.
The bus or the train.
Really, Ricky.
All right, all right!
I was just thinking.
Reservations, please.
I'd like to make reservation for Los Angeles next Monday.
That's two adults and a child.
Family plan.
Uh, Ricky, you've never been across the country, have you?
No.
What?
Leaves in the evening, gets there the next morning?
Well, that will be fine.
Yes, the name is Ricardo.
Just a minute, Ricky.
Listen Ricardo.
R-i-c You know, it'd be a shame to cross the country and not really get a chance to see it, don't you think?
No, no, no.
"C".
"C".
"R-I" You know, on the train, you can see the country you're passing through.
This is little Ricky's first chance to go across the United States, so don't you think you ought to get a chance to really see it?
Don't you think so?
Would you please keep quiet?
No, not you, sir.
No.
Would you please hang on a minute?
Now, look, honey, will you keep quiet so I can talk to the man?
Yeah, well, talk all you want to, but we're taking the train.
All right.
Well What?
!
I said we're taking the train.
Would you please hang on a minute?
Look, this may be the baby's only chance to cross the United States, and I think he should see it.
Now, we are taking the train.
Look, mister, I'm afraid that I'm gonna have Oh, you're married, too.
Thanks anyway.
Now, look, Lucy, why don't you make up your mind which way you want to go before you get me involved with all these people?
First, it's got to be the plane.
Now, it's got to be the train.
Yeah, well, you got to admit it makes sense.
Now, now, here's the number.
You call them.
You'd better read the bus folder before I call them.
Oh, don't be silly, the bus.
You sure you want the train?
I'm positive.
All right, the train.
It's a wonderful chance for the baby to see all of the United States.
I just didn't think of it.
Okay.
That's all.
Okay.
Reservations, please.
Look, I'd like to make a reservation for Los Angeles next Monday for two adults and a child.
Yes, I'll hang on.
Uh, Ricky?
What?
Oh, that's good.
Yeah, I'll pick them up tomorrow.
How much would they be?
Uh, could I speak to you, dear?
In a minute.
No, now, dear.
Will you please hang on a minute?
Well, listen.
"Get the most out of your cross-country trip.
"Don't fly over it "or whoosh through it at 80 or 90 miles an hour "without stopping.
"On the bus, you make frequent stops.
"You can get out, see the scenery, "meet the people in various parts of the country.
You and your fellow passengers are one big happy family".
One big happy family.
Isn't that nice?
Look, mister, I'll have to call you back on this.
Yes, thank you very much.
I was only thinking of the baby.
Look, Lucy, this whole thing was my fault.
I Your fault?
Yeah.
It was something that I said that started this whole thing.
What'd you say?
I do.
Now, look, I'll carry you and little Ricky across country piggyback if you'll just make up your mind which way you want to go.
Now, once and for all, what is it gonna be?
Plane, train or bus?
Have you decided?
Yes.
Well?
We'll go by car.
Good.
I'll call By car?
Yeah.
We don't even own a car.
Well, we'll get one.
I don't know why didn't think of this before.
That way, we can really see the country.
Stop where we want to as long as we want to.
We can see the Grand Canyon, Pike's Peak, Yosemite.
Huh?
You know, you'll have to get a car when you get out there anyway.
You absolutely need a car in Southern California.
You do, huh?
Yeah.
I've been reading up on it.
There's a car for every 2?
people in California.
Now, you and I and little Ricky, that's 2?
people.
When we get to the border, without a car, they won't let us in.
Well, you know something?
I think you've got something there someplace.
We probably can get a convertible here a lot cheaper than out there.
A Cadillac convertible!
Who said nothing about a Cadillac convertible!
I mean, maybe if we can get a used car, we maybe can afford it, but don't get your heart set on a Cadillac convertible kind of a deal.
No.
No, I won't give it another thought.
Good.
Cadillac convertible!
Oh, hi.
Come on in.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Fred.
Hi, Ethel.
Oh, Ethel, wait till you see the wonderful bathing suit I got.
ok, honey, isn't this just absolutely dreamy?
Very nice.
What's eating her?
She's been moping around the house like a sick cat just 'cause you two are leaving.
Aw, honey, don't feel like that.
We're only gonna be gone a month.
No, you won't.
Ricky will be a big star and they'll give him a long-term contract and you'll get a house and stay out there.
We'll never see you again.
Oh, honey, of course you will.
Even if we do stay out there, you'll come visit us.
Oh, no, we won't.
It's too far.
Besides, you'll make all new friends.
They'll be rich and famous.
You won't have any time for us.
Yes, we will, honey.
Now, look, Ethel, I promise you, no matter how big a star we become, and even after we win the Oscar, you'll still be our dearest and closest friends.
We'll never forget you, honey.
We'll never forget you either.
Look at those two, will you?
Two sentimental idiots.
Well, I can't help it when I think I may never see my little godson again.
Oh, no Now, cut it out.
Yeah, cut it out, will you?
When you see all those fancy people, we'll look kind of dowdy and plain to you.
No, honey.
You won't want to see us anymore.
Hey, hey!
Why don't you come along with us?
You mean, us?
Go to California?
Yeah.
Why not?
Oh, wonderful!
Sure, that would be great.
Hey, hey, hold it.
We can't afford a trip like that.
Oh, why not, Fred.
We never go anyplace.
I haven't been out of this town for Now, just a minute.
You forget that lovely trip you took to Minnesota.
Oh, that was a lot of fun.
I went to Mayo Brothers to have my gallstones taken out.
You can yak all you want to.
You know as well as I do that we can't afford this trip.
Those tickets cost money.
Oh, no, no, Fred!
We're getting a car and driving out.
Oh, you're buying a car, huh?
Yeah.
And the whole back seat is empty, so you might as well come along.
How about it, Fred?
Well, it does seem like a cheap way to go.
California, here we come!
Hooray!
That's great, Fred.
It'll practically be for nothing.
We'll each pay for half of the gas Pay for half the gas?
!
New York, here we stay.
Well, I thought as long as you're going, you'll want to pay for half of the expenses.
Well, I don't see why.
You're going anyway.
Well, when the front seat goes, the back seat has to follow.
Well, I just thought Don't think I'm gonna pay for half your trip.
Well, how do you like that?
All right now, fellas, don't lose your tempers.
Oh, it's no use, Lucy.
I knew it was too good to last.
The only way I'll get a trip is to stay right here in New York and hope for another gallstone.
Gee, Ethel, I sure feel sorry for you, being married to such a pinch penny.
Well, you're not exactly married to the horn of plenty.
What do you mean by that?
Well, for once, I think Fred is right.
Why should you stick us for half your gasoline?
Stick you?
Well!
Now I know who holds the penny while Fred pinches it!
That does it.
Yeah, we wouldn't go now if you begged us!
Don't worry.
Come on, Fred.
Yeah, get out of our back seat.
Gladly.
How do you like that?
We got to go anyway.
We got to buy-- pay for the gas anyhow.
Huh!
Huh, huh!
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
Ricky?
Ricky, we are going anyway.
Hmm?
We do have to pay for the gas anyhow and the back seat is empty.
How do you like that?
I think it's finally happened.
What has?
Well, I think that this time I'm a tighter skate than Fred.
Huh?
My flint is skinnier than his.
Does that mean that you want them to go?
Sure.
Oh!
Oh, boy!
You'll really take us, Ricky?
Will you pay for half of the oil?
No, but I'll furnish all the water.
Oh, California, here we come.
Hi, girl.
Hi.
Hi.
How's the baby?
Mrs. Trumbull took him over to the park for a walk.
Did you buy a car?
No.
No.
We looked at a hundred of them and drove them all around the block.
If we'd been driving in a straight line, we'd be in California by now.
Oh, what a shame.
And all those ads in the paper sounded so good, too.
Yeah, they sounded good, but you should've seen them.
I slid in and out of so many car seats, my pants are shiny.
Aw, Ricky.
Well, don't give up.
Fred may be able to help you.
Fred?
Yeah.
He's got a friend who's in the used car business.
Now he tells us.
He never thought about it until after you left.
Oh, good.
I'll call him.
Fred!
He and this guy are real pals.
They used to be in vaudeville together, so he ought to give you a good deal.
Fred!
!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you come in.
Listen, Lucy and Ricky didn't find a car.
I can't hear you.
My head's still ringing.
Now what?
Lucy and Ricky didn't find a car.
They want to talk to your friend.
Yeah, listen, Fred.
Who is this fellow?
Well, it's Al Hergershimer.
He's got a lot over in Brooklyn.
You think he'll give us a good deal?
Sure.
He says since it's me, I can have any car on the lot at wholesale price.
Hey, that sounds wonderful.
Yeah, we'd better go see him right now.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'd better go over there alone, Rick.
Why?
Well, he probably has read the paper about him becoming a movie star.
Oh, The price will go up right away.
Yeah.
All right, you'd better go alone.
Now, you sure you know what we want?
A Cadillac convertible.
Yeah.
Good transportation at a reasonable price.
Don't worry, just leave it to me.
Okay, now, look.
Take a good look at the tires.
It's a long trip to California.
Yeah, Fred, get a pretty color, will ya?
Yeah.
And get a nice, big, roomy back seat.
Okay, now, wish me luck.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
So long.
So long.
Good transportation at a reasonable price.
Yeah, well, sure.
Sure, we're just gonna take our time driving out and see the country.
Oh, isn't it wonderful?
I can hardly believe it myself.
Hey, would you like me to give a message to any of the gang out there?
You know, Clark or Cary or Van or Marlon?
Oh, all right.
Tell Bill Holden that Marion Van Vlack saw Sabrina five times!
Well, he'll be delighted.
Lucy, Lucy, hang up.
Yeah, what?
I got something to tell you.
Oh.
I'll call you back, dear.
Bye-bye.
What?
Fred just called me.
Yeah, what is it?
Well, wake up Ricky.
I want him to hear this, too.
Okay.
Honey, honey, honey.
Huh?
No, no, no.
No, Mr. Zanuck, no.
My price is a million dollars, Mr. Zanuck.
Now, yes or no?
Make up your mind.
Shake him again.
Well, I kind of hate to wake him up until he's made the deal.
Oh, Ricky!
Ricky, wake up!
What?
!
Wake up, Ricky!
Come on, Huh?
come on.
What's the matter?
Yeah.
Fred just called me.
He's bought a car and he's on his way home with it.
Bought it?
!
What?
!
Without showing it to us?
Well, he couldn't get you on the phone and he said there were two guys were waiting just to snap it up.
What is it?
What kind is it?
It's a Cadillac.
A Cadillac!
What color?
Blue.
Oh, that'll be wonderful with my hair!
Is it a convertible?
I don't know, but he said it was just like brand-new, that paint's in good shape, the tires are fine and the top works perfectly.
The top.
That means it's a convertible.
Oh, sure.
A blue Cadillac convertible!
Oh, boy!
Eh, how-how-how much did it cost?
$300.
$300?
For a Cadillac?
Oh, no, that Oh, that must be the down payment or something.
Oh, well, maybe so.
I was so excited, I don't really know.
Well, let's go downstairs and wait for him, huh?
I'll get my coat Okay.
and meet you I wonder how much he really paid for this.
Gee, I hope the baby gets back in time to see it.
Oh, boy, a blue Cadillac convertible!
I wonder what's keeping him.
Gee, our first car.
I can hardly wait to see it.
I hope he got a good car.
It's a long trip to California.
Oh, it will be a good one.
I told you, this is a good friend of Fred's.
That's good.
Hey, here comes a blue car.
And it's a Cadillac.
And isn't that Fred driving?
I don't think so.
Oh, it's a beauty and it's almost brand-new.
Sure, that's Fred.
No.
Of course it is.
It's our car, and it's Fred driving.
Then how come it turned the corner?
Oh.
Oh Here comes a blue car!
Yeah.
Oh, that isn't a Cadillac, is it, Ricky?
I don't think so.
I hope not.
That car must be seven or eight years old.
We'll never get to California.
Well, what do you think of it?
Fred Mertz, this better be some kind of a joke.
Joke?
This is a very fine car.
It is a Cadillac.
It is?
Yeah, it's a Cadillac all right.
And it is a convertible.
The top goes up and down.
Well, the doors work fine.
Fred, you really didn't pay 300 bucks for this hunk of junk?
Now, just for your information, two other guys wanted to buy this car.
Where were they from?
The Smithsonian Institute?
So, it isn't brand-new, but it's better than one of those flimsy jobs off the assembly line.
They don't make them like this anymore.
I can understand why.
Now, put that back.
Does this one come off, too?
You dropped something.
It's falling apart right in front of our eyes.
Well, maybe the body does need a little tightening, but that engine is sound as a dollar.
Yeah?
That's about all it's worth, too.
I tell you, this car's in good shape, and it drives beautifully.
Now jump in and I'll take you for a spin.
Well, what have we got to lose?
Our lives, that's what.
Come on, get in, get in.
All right, go on.
Get in.
Come on, let's hurry up and get out of here before we have to ride the engine bareback.
Well okay, here we go.
Just needs a little tune-up, that's all.
Fred Mertz, you go right back to Brooklyn and get the money you paid for this time bomb.
Well, maybe it isn't everything he said it was.
I'm sorry, Ricky.
I hope I can get your money back.
My money?
!
Well, naturally, I didn't want to buy a car.
Well, I didn't tell you to buy this thing.
How about that, Ethel?
Don't come crying to me.
Anybody who's dumb enough to pay $300 for this thing deserves to lose the money.
Now, you go back to Brooklyn, and don't you come home until you've got our money in your pocket.
Okay.
Have you got 15 cents for the subway?
Gee, I felt sorry for Fred.
He looked so disappointed.
Yeah.
I wish there was some way that I could help him, Ethel.
Oh, it serves him right.
Maybe it'll teach him a lesson.
You think they'll give him his money back?
Well, if they don't, maybe he can sell it to somebody.
Who?
Where are you going to find another Fred?
Well, there must be somebody that wants an old car like that.
Maybe a museum or something.
Well, maybe a television company or a moving picture outfit or something like that might be able to use it Hey!
Hey!
How about calling Fred's used car pal and telling him that we're a television studio and that we need a car like that?
And that we'll pay maybe as much as $500.
Oh, he'd buy it back from Fred in a jiffy.
What's that guy's name?
Uh, Hergershimer.
I got the number.
Fred gave it to me in case I had to call him.
Uh, Nevins 8-2098.
Lucy, I got to hand it to you.
You got a wonderful sneaky mind.
Well, thank you very much.
Hey, you let me better let me talk to him.
Where are you supposed to be from?
The Cuban Television Network?
Yeah.
CBS.
The Cuban Broadcasting System.
Oh Hello.
Hello.
Um I know this is no use.
I've made about a hundred phone calls, but, uh, we need a certain type of automobile for a television sketch that we're doing.
Uh, yes, we need a a 1923 Cadillac touring car.
Uh, we don't have much money, but, uh, we could pay $500.
Oh.
Oh, you don't have one right there, but you know where you could get one?
Oh, that's wonderful.
Just a minute.
Oh, that's wonderful, Mr. O'Brien!
He knows where he can get one, Mr. O'Brien!
: Faith and Begorra, that is good news!
Uh, yeah, would you, would you call me back on that?
Uh, my name is McGillicuddy.
Uh, yes, I'm with the  Television Company.
Yes, the telephone number is Murray Hill 5-9-0-9-9 Yes.
Yes, will you call me right back?
Thank you.
He bit!
LUCY AND  Hi, Fred.
Thought I was pretty dumb, huh?
Thought I couldn't make a decent deal, huh?
What happened, Fred?
What happened, Fred?
Well, I'll tell you what happened.
I no sooner walked on his lot, then he wanted to buy the car back.
Well, you sold it back to him.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
He offered me $250.
Before I could say yes or no, he said suspicious.
But you sold it back to him.
Now, just a minute.
Let me tell you, will you?
When he got as high as $400, I said that's good enough for me.
So you sold it to him and made a hundred dollars profit.
Why, you sly old dog.
Did you, Fred?
When he said $400, I said to him, "Now, look, Al, I know you.
Come clean with me".
So, he admitted that some television company was after the car and had offered $500.
They left their telephone number with them, so that gave us $200 profit.
We decided to split.
Oh, so he gave you the $400.
Well, not exactly.
I gave him another hundred and he gave me the telephone number.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Oh Hi.
Oh, hi.
What you doing?
I'm just checking our luggage for the trip.
This stuff will never make it to California.
Did you ever see anything that looked so awful?
Yeah, Fred.
What's the matter with him?
Oh, he just can't get over that $400 he lost buying that old car.
No kidding.
You ought to see him.
He just sits and stares into space, glassy-eyed.
Well, for heaven's sake, I know $400 is a lot of money, but it's nothing to go into a state of shock over.
Oh, you don't know Fred.
Once he actually foamed at the mouth when his penny got stuck in a peanut machine.
Oh, not really.
I'm telling you, it took two men and a crowbar to get his hand out of the slot.
And you won't believe this.
I can't get him to eat anything.
Fred won't eat?
Oh, he is sick.
Gee, honey, there must be something we can do to snap him out of it.
Oh, I've tried everything.
You know his friend that runs the garage on the next block?
Joe?
Joe.
Joe said he'd fix up the whole car, so it would run and only charge $20 and even that didn't make any impression on him.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Will you see what you can do, Lucy?
Sure, I'll take a crack at him.
I don't know what I could do.
Huh.
Hi, Fred, you old rascal you.
How's every little thing, huh?
Fred?
Oh, Fred.
Um, Fred, I made an apple pie last night.
How would you like a big piece with a big hunk of cheese on it, huh?
Does that sound good, Fred?
Oh, boy, he's real gone.
Isn't that awful?
I'll go get the baby, he'll notice him.
Okay.
Sit down, Fred.
We're going to go see Uncle Fred, honey.
We're going to say hello to Uncle Fred, huh?
There he is.
There's Uncle Fred.
Say hi!
Say, "Hi, Uncle Fred".
Say hi!
Hi, hi.
Wave your hand at him.
Give him a kiss.
Give him a kiss.
Well, I give up.
What am I gonna do?
I don't know.
When he doesn't notice the baby, ugh!
He's still warm.
Lucy, guess what!
Hi.
Hi, Ethel, hi, Fred.
Lucy?
Where's Lucy?
Uh, what-what is it?
What is it?
I want her to hear.
Lucy!
Yeah?
Come here, honey!
What?
I bought a new car.
A new one?
!
A brand-new Pontiac.
A new Pontiac!
Yeah.
You said you couldn't afford a new car.
Yeah, I know, I know, but I started thinking about the long trip and everything, and I think it's a better investment anyway.
Don't you think so, Fred?
Fred?
What's the matter with him?
He's in a state of shock.
It's that $400.
Oh.
Yeah, it was too much for him.
He's retired from reality.
He can't hear a word we say.
Well, that's too bad because I got wonderful news.
What?
Well, I used Fred's old Cadillac as a trade-in so Fred will get all his money back.
What's that?
I think we struck a nerve.
What's this about getting my money back?
Well, welcome back to the world, Fred!
Fred, I bought a brand-new car, see?
And I, I used your old car as a trade-in, and the guy allowed me $400 on it.
So, all I got to do is give you the $400 and everybody's happy.
When do we see the car?
Uh, yeah, where is it?
When do we eat?
He's really recovered.
It's right down at the curb right now.
Here?
Well, come on, let's go see it.
Oh, the baby.
Come on, Fred.
Uh, honey, go get Mrs. Trumbull.
Ask her to come over for a minute, will ya?
Okay, sure.
We'll see you downstairs.
Oh, no, you don't!
Nobody's gonna see that car before I do.
While we're waiting, how about something to eat?
Now you waited two whole days to eat, you can wait a few minutes longer.
Hurry up, Ricky!
Oh, Ricky, it's beautiful!
Isn't that dreamy?
Oh, what a pip!
Automatic transmission?
Naturally.
How much horsepower?
Oh, great.
Oh, Ethel, smell.
There's nothing like the smell of a new car, huh?
Wait till you see the motor, Fred.
I want to see it.
Look in here.
Yeah.
Oh Isn't that beautiful  Oh!
What are you trying to do?
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you?
You crazy or something?
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go for a ride.
No, no, no, we can't.
Why not?
Because we're not insured.
Oh.
Well, you drove it home.
Yeah, I know, but I shouldn't have.
I called the insurance man, and he wasn't in the office.
I just couldn't wait any longer to show it to you.
Come on, just once around the block.
Yeah, Come on, Rick.
just once.
All right, come on.
Just once.
Just once.
Yeah, okay.
We're gonna ride all the way to California!
Oh, isn't this great?
Oh, come on, honey, hurry up, give me the keys!
Haven't you forgotten something?
What?
You don't know how to drive.
Oh.
Hey, Fred, there's some difference in this and that old relic you bought.
All right, all right.
We shouldn't be doing this.
Oh, well.
We'll go once around the block.
Yeah.
Gee, I hope somebody sees us.
Oh, to California, sitting like this.
Yeah.
Hey, we got a new car!
Look everybody, we got a new car!
Hey, look!
Lucy.
Yeah?
Listen, honey, I got to go down to the club What are you doing?
Oh, I can't take my eyes off it.
That is the most beautiful car in the whole world.
It's pretty, isn't it?
Yeah.
Take me for another ride.
No.
We don't move that car until it's insured.
Well, call the man again, go on.
All right.
You know, I called him four times.
He didn't answer any one of the times.
Maybe he's out of town or something.
Ricky?
What?
When are you gonna teach me to drive?
Uh, I got to go to the club.
Uh, I'm gonna take the the car and show it to the boys, so I can't now.
Well, Good-bye, dear.
Now, honey, this is important.
If we're gonna live in Los Angeles, I have to know how to drive.
Lucy, please, they got enough traffic problems in Los Angeles already.
Now, honey, listen.
Suppose we're driving across country.
We're in the middle of the desert, miles from anywhere, and you get sick and then Fred gets sick, and Ethel can't drive and there we are-- miles from civilization.
It's hot, the sun is pouring down, it's broiling.
We're thirsty, our throats are parched.
Water!
Water!
Water!
: Water Oh, oh, if I had only learned to drive, I could save us all.
Water!
Water!
Wa-ater!
Are you getting my message?
No.
Well, then why didn't you say so?
That hurt my throat.
Come on, Ricky, say that you'll teach me to drive!
Nope.
You'll be sorry, I'm gonna nag you about this.
I'm not gonna let you alone a minute till you promise me Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'll tich you.
Well those are the most beautiful words I ever heard: "I'll tich you".
How come you gave in so quickly?
No, I didn't give up quickly.
I laid awake all night last night, trying to figure a way out of this.
There is none.
When can I have my driving lesson?
This afternoon?
Maybe.
Oh, well, I you know, I practically know how to drive.
I took a couple of lessons in high school.
Well, things have changed a little since then.
Oh, have they?
Come here.
Here's the name of the man, his phone number and the all the information you got to give him.
Yeah.
Now, If you can get this guy on the phone before I come back from the club, I'll give you a lesson this afternoon.
Oh, wonderful!
Okay.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, dear.
Oh, boy!
Hi, Ricky, how'd the driving lesson go?
How'd it go, Ricky?
Es imposible.
Lo que paso es imposible.
No se le puede explicar a nadie lo que paso hoy en el tunel.
iQue horror!
iQue barbaridad!
Si se lo dice a alguien, no lo creen.
Where you going?
Huh?
Where you going?
Oh, uh I'm going to rehearsal.
Oh, aren't you gonna take your car?
What was that?
Aren't you gonna take your car?
No, no.
I may never drive again.
What's the matter with him?
Oh He got mad at me while I was driving through the Holland Tunnel.
Ricky let you drive through the Holland Tunnel?
Well, he didn't mean to.
I got caught in a stream of traffic and I couldn't stop.
But you drove all the way through the Holland Tunnel!
Halfway through.
What do you mean halfway?
Well, Ricky was late for rehearsal and I saw an opportunity to How was I supposed to know there wasn't room to make a U-turn?
You made a U-turn in the Holland Tunnel?
!
Oh, brother, that must have been something.
Yeah.
The policeman said the cars were backed up all the way to East Orange, New Jersey.
I'll bet.
Where's the baby?
Oh, Mrs. Trumbull took him to the zoo.
Oh, good.
You know, Ethel, it was awful exciting learning to drive, though.
You should have seen me.
I was just like a real professional.
I hung my arm out the window, you know.
Oh, boy, I envy you.
I always wanted Fred to teach me how to drive, but we never owned a car.
Well, you should learn how to drive.
That way, we could take turns driving across the country.
You think so?
Sure.
This way, you're just so much dead weight.
Well, maybe I'll develop other talents like folding up road maps and keeping an eye open for clean restrooms.
Oh Now, honey.
No, you really should learn to drive, though.
You know who's gonna teach you?
Who?
Me.
You?
Yeah.
You just learned this morning.
Listen, I drove for a whole hour.
Oh, pardon me, Barney Oldfield.
Come on, come on, I'll show you how it goes.
Hey, wait!
What?
Do you think we ought to drive that without Ricky's permission?
Oh, we're not gonna drive it.
You just sit behind the wheel and I'll show you how things work.
Sort of a dry run, you know.
Okay.
Come on.
Oh, listen, when we get back upstairs, remind me to call the man about the insurance for the car, will you?
You mean Ricky let you drive this car and it wasn't insured?
!
Well, he sort of thought it was insured.
He told me to call the man, but I couldn't get him and I didn't want to miss my driving lesson.
Lucy!
Well, he didn't ask me!
Anyway, nothing happened.
There's no harm done.
Get in.
All right.
Oh, gee, I never thought this would happen to me.
Ooh!
Oh, boy, I feel so sporty.
Now, what do I do?
Well, if you had the key, you'd put Oh, oh, he left the key in here.
What do I do?
Just turn the key.
Uh-huh.
Turn the key.
What was that?
Oh, well, nothing to get frightened now.
That's just the motor.
Oh.
There, now see this gidget here?
Yeah.
Now, that's neutral, then you put it in drive, and then you put it in low.
See?
Yeah.
Now, there's nothing to it really, Isn't that motor quiet, though?
It isn't even running.
Of course it's running.
No, it isn't.
Sure it is.
Step on the gas, you'll see.
Okay.
That it?
Yeah.
Oh, Lucy!
Put the brake on!
Put the brake on!
Oh, Lucy!
What's the matter with you, Ethel?
I told you not to take it out of gear.
I don't know what a gear is.
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Oh, our beautiful car!
Oh, Ethel, look at that grill!
Oh, and it's all my fault.
Oh, no, it's my fault.
I wanted to teach you to drive.
What are we gonna do?
Let's hop in the car and head for the border.
No, we got to get these cars apart.
And then what?
Well, mayeb I can take the Pontiac down to the garage and get it fixed before Ricky comes home.
Come on, jump up on here.
Jump up on here?
Yeah, and bounce up and down.
You up there?
Yeah.
All right.
Now jump up and down.
What are we doing this for?
I don't know.
Whenever two cars get stuck together, the men do it.
Oh.
Well, it isn't doing any good.
No, I guess not.
I guess we'll have to drive both cars to California.
Hey, are the keys in the Cadillac?
Yeah, They're under the seat.
The man's gonna pick it up today.
Oh, here they are.
What are you gonna do?
Listen, do you think if I drove this car to the garage, that one would follow?
Do you know how to drive this?
Oh, sure.
I learned to drive in a car like this.
This is the gear shift and this is the brake and this is the clutch.
Or is this the brake and this the clutch?
Don't you know?
Well, I'll find out as soon as I get going, you know.
How?
Well, if I step on the brake, and it doesn't stop, it was the clutch.
Let's go.
Okay.
Oh, hey, wait a minute.
You got to stay here.
Stay here?
Yeah, and stall everybody off.
Wh-Wh-What'll I do?
Look.
Where's Fred?
He's downtown.
Look, if Fred comes back, you tell him that the man came for the Cadillac and that Ricky has the Pontiac downtown.
If the man comes for the Cadillac, you tell him that Fred has it out for one last farewell spin.
If Ricky comes home, you tell him the man came for the Cadillac and Fred took the Pontiac downtown to have it washed.
Okay?
No, you stay here and tell that story.
I'll drive the car to the garage.
No, you can't do that.
You haven't even soloed yet.
Oh.
Well, I hope you know what you're doing.
Oh, I hope so, too.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Okay.
Ah.
Take it easy now.
Yeah, I will.
Be careful.
Yeah.
Have I got it?
Yeah, it's coming.
Okay.
Lucy!
What happened?
You won't believe it.
Listen, when you left here, weren't you driving that car and wasn't this car hooked onto the back of that car?
Well, how did, how did that car get hooked onto the back of this car?
It was the most horrible experience of my life.
And I've had some pretty horrible experiences.
I'll bet, Ethel, if I skipped my next henna rinse, I'd find my hair is snow white.
Well, tell me what happened.
Well, I went to down to the garage to ask the mechanic how much it would cost to fix the Pontiac.
He said it might be as much as $150.
Why $150?
Oh, I don't know.
Something's out of line in the front of the Pontiac.
So, I didn't have that much money, so I just decided to drive the cars back here, park them in front of the apartment and just tell Ricky I didn't know how any of it happened.
Well, how did the Cadillac get hooked onto the back of the Yeah, I'm coming to that.
You know that underpass by Grand Central Station?
Yeah.
Well, I was driving on the downhill side of it and a car started to pass me and it was a new Pontiac just like our car and the driver was coming awful close so I turned to give him a dirty look and no one was driving.
No one was driving?
So I looked back at our car and it was gone.
It came unhooked, and then what?
Well, it passed me at the bottom of the hill and I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, and the Pontiac kept on going up the hill and it didn't quite make it to the top.
It didn't?
Not much, it didn't.
It started rolling backwards and crashed right into me.
You're right, I don't believe it.
I wouldn't have believed it either if it hadn't happened to me.
What are you gonna say to Ricky?
How about good-bye?
No, Ethel, our only chance is to pretend complete innocence.
Oh, we'll never get away with it.
Well, we'd better get away with it, or Ricky and Fred will be planting their footprints somewhere and it won't be Grauman's Chinese Theatre.
Ethel, I wonder how those two cars got that way.
What cars?
Here they come.
Here they come.
Now, remember, they're gonna scream and yell at us, but we just have to pretend we don't know what they're talking about.
Just, just act nonchalant.
Oh, hi, fellas.
Hi, fellas.
What's new?
How are things down at the club, dear?
Say something.
Don't just stare at me!
I don't know anything about those cars!
Aha.
So, it was you.
Us.
Look, Lucy, I am trying awfully hard to control my temper, because this time I am afraid to lose it.
Yeah, well, look, I can explain everything.
I wasn't driving the car.
I was just showing Ethel how things work and you left the key and I just showed her how to turn it on the motor and all of a sudden, the Pontiac jumped up and rammed the Cadillac and we tried to get the cars apart and we couldn't.
And so then I drove the cars to the garage.
I was gonna get the Pontiac fixed before you came home and, and well, I went down a hill and a car started to pass me and I stopped and the car went on up the hill and, and it didn't quite get up to the top and then it came back downhill and crashed right into me and I drove the cars home.
That's all there is to it.
What's so funny?
It's so ridiculous.
This could only happen to Lucy.
Yeah, yeah, just to me.
Stupid old me.
How can you laugh?
!
What do you think it's gonna cost us to have those cars fixed?
Oh, don't worry about that, Fred, I'm insured.
We've lost Lucy.
What's the matter with her?
Well, she didn't call the man.
Ricky isn't insured.
Well, we've lost him, too.
Don't worry, Fred.
You don't think I was gonna be so stupid as to let Lucy do it?
I called the insurance man myself.
You did?
Well, we got him back.
Now, as far as you are concerned, young lady  Lucy?
I don't think you're getting through to her.
Lucy!
Maybe she's afraid to come back.
Tell her you won't do anything to her.
Lucy, I won't do anything to you.
Lucy, I said I wasn't gonna do anything to you.
All right, all right, cross my heart.
Hi.
But I didn't promise you that I wasn't gonna tell you what I think about you.
Oh.
Oh, you're just gonna tell me, huh?
Yeah.
Pero no-no-no se donde empezar.
Oh.
?
Que te pasa?
?
Se te perdio el sentido?
?
Que tu tienes en la cabeza?
?
No tienes nada metido en la cabeza?
?
Esta la cabeza muerta?
?
No tienes nada aqui completamente?
Un dia te voy a coger como si fueras un pollito y te voy a coger por pescuezito y voy a poner aqui los dedos y.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hi.
Hi, girl.
I brought your mail.
Oh, thanks.
What are you doing?
I'm figuring out the route we're going to take to California.
Oh, good.
I've got the list of all the places that each of us wants to see.
Now, Ricky wants to see New Orleans and the Rockies, and Fred wants to go to Cincinnati and Niagara Falls.
And I want to see the Ozark Mountains and the Carlsbad Caverns.
I know, and we all want to see the Grand Canyon and Fred says we must not miss Salt Lake City.
Believe me, it's taken some brainwork to figure out an itinerary that'll please everyone.
It's impossible.
No, no, it's not impossible.
Just takes a little sensible planning.
See?
Well, the only thing is, we have to go through New York three times on the way to Chicago.
Oh, fine.
Well, we'll just have to fight that out on the road.
Yeah, I guess so.
Want to see your mail?
Oh, yeah.
Anything interesting?
Two bills and an ad and a letter from your mother.
Oh, what did she say?
Now, Lucy, you know I never read your mail.
Only postcards and everybody knows they're fair game.
Besides, your mother's letter came to me.
Oh, sure.
It did.
She enclosed it in a letter she wrote to me.
"Dear Ethel: I lost Lucy's address "and couldn't find it "in the New York phone book.
"There are so many Richardsons listed".
Richardson?
She never remembers Ricky's last name.
Well, that isn't even close.
Yeah, but she's getting better.
She refused to admit I was married at all until after the baby came.
Oh, Lucy  Um "I was able to find your address "and as you live in the same building, "I wonder if it would be too much trouble for you to give the enclosed letter to her".
She really figures things out, bless her little birdbrain.
Well, like mother, like uh Oh, uh What does your letter say?
"Dear Lucy: How are you and Micky"?
Micky.
"I couldn't find your address, "so I'm sending this letter to Ethel Mertz.
"If you don't get it, please let me know as I have made a copy of it".
Well, that's good thinking.
"The copy is enclosed".
"As a matter of fact, if you have read this far, "you must have received this letter, so tear up the copy and thank Ethel for me".
Thank you.
Oh, it was nothing.
"After hearing the good news about you going west, "I got to thinking how I've never been any further west than Youngstown, Ohio" Oh, no!
"And this seems like a golden opportunity for me to get to California".
Oh, just wait till Micky Richardson hears about this.
Well, you'll just have to stop her.
Too late.
Listen to this: "I rented my house to a lovely couple, "and I bought a whole new wardrobe for the trip.
"Sorry I didn't tell you I was going with you sooner, "but you know how it is when you're planning a long trip: "Some little detail is liable to slip your mind.
I remain sincerely yours, Mrs. McGillicuddy".
Mrs. McGillicuddy?
That's kind of formal, isn't it?
Well, sometimes she forgets who she's writing to.
Well, what are you going to do?
Well there's just one thing to do.
What?
I'll say "Ricky, my mother is going to California with us" and then I'll jump out the window.
Now, there, for a minute, you were commencing to sound like a real wife.
What do you mean?
Well, I like that feeling when you said, "Ricky, my mother is going to California with us".
Oh, I like that feeling, too.
It's what comes after that scares me.
Now, you might be surprised at what would happen if you took a real firm stand with Ricky.
You think so?
Sure.
Look at the way I handle Fred.
Yeah, but you can lick Fred.
Oh You know maybe you got something there, Ethel.
Sure.
I'm not going to have my mother embarrassed.
I've got just as many rights around here as he has.
Now you're talking.
I'm going to say "Ricky, my mother is going to California with us and that's that"!
Good girl.
That's just what I'll tell him.
On the phone.
Now, you've got to face him eventually.
Well, this will sort of give me a head start.
Hello, Ricky.
I got a letter from my mother today, and she's going to California with us and that's that!
And I don't want any argument about it!
Hello, Ricky.
I got a letter from Mother today, dear.
What are you doing?
The line's busy.
I was just practicing.
Oh, fine.
But I think you're right.
The thing to do is be firm.
Hello, Ricky.
I got a letter from mother today and she's going to California with us and that's that!
And I don't want any argument.
What?
!
Do you hear me?
!
Oh!
don't get excited.
Now, please.
Ricky, please, now  Mother!
Well!
I told you, dear, long before you ever got married Well, uh, uh, it's not what you think, Mother.
Uh, uh, Ricky and I were just rehearsing a a scene from the picture that he's going to do out in Hollywood.
Weren't we, dear?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, Mother we were rehearsing, a scene, that's right.
Now, you were very good, sweetie.
Thank you.
Mother, it's so good to see you.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Isn't it good to see mother, dear?
Yes, yes.
Mother?
You don't understand any Spanish, do you?
Not a word.
Good.
Pick up Mother's bags, dear.
Oh, yes, sure.
Excuse me.
Thank you, Micky.
You're welcome.
Mother, you must be tired.
Why don't you sit down.
How's everything in Jamestown?
Oh, just wonderful.
Have you seen Marian von Black?
Oh, they moved way up on the Old Hunt Road.
No kidding.
Mother, why didn't you call us from the station?
We would have picked you up.
Oh, that's all right, dear.
I took the bus.
It let me off right in front of the door.
Oh.
Wait a minute.
The bus doesn't come down this street.
That's what the bus driver tried to tell me.
He was so ridiculous.
Well, it was only two blocks out of his way, and all he had to do was turn the steering wheel.
Do you mean to tell me, you got the bus driver to leave his route and bring you right to our door?
I made a bargain with him.
He promised to bring me here and I promised never to ride on a New York bus again.
I think he made a fine deal for himself.
Well, Micky I bet you were surprised when Lucy told you I was going to Hollywood with you.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah, I was very surprised.
Oh, you know, dear, I hated to give up my club activities-- I'm chairman of the bazaar this year-- and leave my friends, but I figured this was my chance to take it to them in person.
What was that?
What?
Take what to them in person?
My book.
Oh, didn't I tell you?
I wrote a book.
You?
Yes.
You didn't think I could write, did you?
No.
I didn't even know that you could re Ricky!
Well, Mother, what is your book about?
It's the story of our family.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Oh, it should make a wonderful picture.
Yeah, yeah, those screwball comedies are very successful.
Uh, Mother, I wouldn't count too much on selling your book out there, you know.
They have an awful lot of material floating around.
Oh, ordinarily, yes, but now that Micky is a star, he can take my book right to Dore Schary.
Uh, Lucy, dear.
What?
I would like to rehearse that scene again.
Would you step in the next room with me?
No, not now, dear.
Yeah, now!
No, I want to talk to mother.
I'm so glad to see you, Mother.
It's been such a long time.
Come on in the kitchen.
We'll have a nice, long talk.
Real long one; maybe three days or so.
Pardon us, dear.
There he is.
Now, that's Grandma's little darling.
Oh, come on, dear, now we're going to market.
Now, you be a good boy and mind Grandma, you hear?
Mother, please, no c-a-n-d-y.
Oh, all right, all right.
Here we go.
Bye-bye.
Lucy?
What?
Now that we're alone, I'd like to speak to you.
Uh, well, I have some packing to do, dear.
We can talk later.
When?
Well, when we get out to California.
Lucy, I want to speak to you and I want to speak to you now.
Now, look, I'm not gonna drive 3,000 miles in the same car with you mother.
Do you think three shirts will be enough for you, dear?
'Course not, I need at least a doz Never mind trying to get me off track.
I don't like the way things are developing around here.
I get a part in a picture.
It's all very simple.
You and I and little Ricky Lucy?
are going to go to Hollywood.
And then all of a sudden, everybody that we've ever known is coming along with us!
Oh, they are not.
They are, too!
Why couldn't we go alone?
Now, first you talked the Mertzes into horning in.
I did not.
That was their own idea.
Well, they're tagging along now anyway.
And to top it off, you wanted to take your mother along, too.
Now, Ricky, don't get all excited.
Just be sensible.
I'm not gonna tell my mother she can't go when it means so much to her.
Well, somebody's got to tell her.
Well, you tell her!
All right, I'll tell her.
Don't you dare!
And that's that!
What's that?
She's going-- that's what's that!
Oh, hi, come on in.
Why so formal?
That's the first time you've rung the bell in years.
Hi!
What's the matter?
We have something to tell you.
Yeah.
What?
We can't go on your trip.
What?
What?
!
What are you talking about?
We're not going to California, that's what we're talking about.
But why?
Well, we just changed our mind.
We don't feel like going anymore, that's all.
But what happened?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
You two act like you were sore at something.
Us?
Sore?
Come on, honeybunch.
Now, wait a minute, you two.
What is the matter?
Nothing's the matter.
Go ahead and have a nice trip.
And don't forget to drop a postcard to Mr. And Mrs. Fred Horn-in-ski or, as we are more commonly known, the Tagalong Mertzes!
Bon voyage!
Well, I hope you're satisfied.
Me?
What did I do?
Ethel heard you!
How could she have heard me?
!
How could she help hearing you with your big mouth and her big ears?
!
Now, look, I'm not going to take the rap for this.
I wanted the Mertzes along.
You know that.
This whole thing wouldn't have happened if you hadn't insisted to bring your mother along, too.
Honestly, your mother is the most Hello, mother!
Oh, darling Oh, Mother, I told you not to give him any candy.
Oh, is that what you spelled out?
Oh		Oh, now, one little lollipop won't hurt him.
And grandma knows what's best for him, doesn't she?
You'd better put him down for his nap.
Okay, dear.
Oh, dear.
Who are you calling now?
Ethel.
Oh.
Hello, Ethel.
Ethel, listen to me.
Ethel, listen!
Now, you know Ricky didn't mean that.
You know how he is when he gets excited.
Now, listen, if I'd taken half the things he said to me seriously, I'd have left him long ago.
What?
Hello?
Hello?
She hung up.
Well, I don't blame her.
Lucy?
Micky?
I want to speak to you about something.
What is it, Mother?
I didn't say anything in front of the baby because little pitchers have big ears.
I ran into the Mertzes in the hall.
Yes?
They told me they're not going to California and I know why.
You do?
Yes.
It's because of me.
Now, just a minute, Mother.
It has nothing to do with you.
Oh, yes, it has.
Everything was all right until I decided to go.
I'm the fly in the ointment.
Well, I'm not going.
You are, too.
Oh, no, I'm not.
Ricky Well, honey, she's made up her mind.
You tell my mother she has got to go.
Honey, you don't want to force her.
That would make her unhappy.
All right, let me tell you something.
If Mother isn't going, I'm not going.
All right, then let me tell you something.
If you're not going, I'm not going.
Okay.
Okay.
May we come in again?
Why not?
We got to talking it over and we decided we acted pretty childish.
Yeah, we cooled off.
We realize that Ricky said what he did because he was a little upset about your, uh But, anyway, he didn't mean it.
So, we're going to go on the trip after all.
Well, I hope you have a good time.
Send us a postcard when you get out there.
What do you mean?
Nobody's going.
What's she talking about?
We had a beef.
The trip has been called off.
And it's all my fault.
I realized that you weren't going because of me, so I Oh, no, honey, that wasn't it at all.
We had a little misunderstanding and we just decided to forget it, so now we're going.
Are you sure?
Sure.
Well, I wasn't going to go because you weren't going to if I was going.
But if you're going when I'm going, I might as well go.
What did she say?
I don't know, but I think she's going to go.
Of course she is.
And I wasn't going because she wasn't going.
But if she's going, I might as well go.
So, now everybody's going except, uh I'm out of the mood.
You four take the trip.
Now, Ricky, if you're not going, I'm not going.
But if Lucy's not going, I certainly am not going.
Well, if you three aren't going, we certainly can't Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Oh, what a bunch of characters I'm mixed up with.
Look, I'm going, everybody's going, Mother's going, everything's fine.
Now, the only thing I insist on is an early start.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, please pack all your things up tonight.
We're going to leave at 6:00 a.m. in the morning.
Room for all these, Rick?
Oh, yeah.
It's like a dance hall in here.
Here, give me those.
This is all the heavy stuff.
The girls are bringing down some odds and ends later.
Oh, that's good.
Yeah.
There we go.
Fine.
See?
Yeah, easy.
How about that, huh?
Yeah, how about that?
Well, you can always tie a rope on it and drag it along behind.
No, we got plenty of room.
Yeah, put it over there.
I'll just take a couple of these ones out of there and put it in this.
Now what happens?
Well, I think if I put this one first, it'll work out right.
Why you put this in here for?
I didn't put it in.
I did, dear.
I was just trying to help.
Oh.
Well, look, honey, whatever you got left up there, just put it on the sidewalk and then when we're ready for you, we'll fit it in, see?
Okay.
Oh, listen, Mother made sandwiches so we won't have to stop for lunch.
Good!
Well, thanks.
Yeah.
I'll get them all out of here.
All right.
All right.
You can put them down there.
Okay.
Do you think this will be enough lunch?
Yes.
This is a heavy one.
Be careful with that.
Yeah.
I'm going to get in here, Fred, and you hand them to me.
See All right.
Okay?
What do you want first?
Give me that big one, Fred.
Yeah.
This?
I got it.
It's heavy.
This one?
Yeah.
That's it.
This is heavy, too.
Careful with that.
Give me another one.
That one right there.
Now what, the fat one?
Yeah.
Let's try the fat one there.
And I'll put this Watch-- now try it.
Back in here, see?
Now, what about this?
That's it.
That one Got it?
Yeah.
Now, here's a little one, makeup kit.
No spot for that?
No.
I got to take this one out.
Turn that around the other way.
That way.
Next.
Up with that.
This one?
Now.
That little one will now fit in there.
Is that it?
Yeah, that's done it.
There.
Okay.
Ay-ay-ay.
There we are.
Isn't that great?
Yeah.
Ahh!
What's all this junk?
Are they crazy or something?
Oh Oh, no Lucy, what's all this junk?
Junk?
This is all necessary stuff.
Well, that's it, that's all.
Well, we can't take all this stuff.
We-we haven't got any more room.
Well, make room!
It's impossible.
What do we do with it?
Well, we'll have to live it here, that's all.
"Live" it here?
We need all this.
Wait a minute, will you?
Now, I've been sizing this up and I think if we pack it all just right, we can make it.
That's ridiculous.
Why don't you let me try?
Let him try.
Okay, try.
Now, Ricky, you go down in the basement and bring me a nice piece of good, strong rope.
Okay, I'll get you the rope.
What do you want us to do, Fred?
Go on back in the house and relax, sit down!
Get out of here!
Okay.
Give me that, will you?
Give me that!
Give me that.
Put that Go on, get out of here!
Go on with the rest of them!
All right, this was quite a job, but I know how to pack this kind of stuff.
There it is.
Well now I've seen everything.
What's wrong with it?
Well, for one thing, I can't see where I'm going.
Oh, no, no.
I figured that out, too.
I left you a nice driving view right down through the middle here.
Honestly, I could have loaded it better with a pitchfork.
Our nice Pontiac.
It looks like a laundry wagon.
Yeah, well, you got to admit, I got everything in.
Well, where are we going?
Get in there.
There's plenty of room in there for This is the most ridiculous thing I've Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, everybody.
Listen to me.
Did it ever occur to any of us that we could send this stuff on ahead?
Of course!
What a bunch of jugheads we are!
Sure, we'll be on the road two weeks.
It'll get there before we do.
Oh, dear, are we really going to be driving for two whole weeks?
Well, of course, Mother.
It's 3,000 miles, and we're taking all those little side trips.
Well, in that case, there's something you ought to know.
What?
I get carsick.
That's all, brother.
That's all.
Oh, Mother, not in this car, you won't.
This, this rides like a dream.
Oh, no, it wouldn't happen in this car.
Well, I had no idea it would take two weeks.
It didn't look that far on the map.
Oh, mother I think I'll go by plane.
Good!
And I think little Ricky should go with me.
The baby?
Gee, two weeks is a long time on the road, Ethel.
Yeah.
Uh, it doesn't cost hardly anything to send the baby on the plane.
What do you think, Ricky?
I think it's a wonderful idea.
I do, too.
I think that's great.
Yeah, you take him on the plane.
Okay, let's repack the car, huh?
Oh, now, just when I got everything all set!
All set for what?
!
You couldn't even get through the Holland Tunnel with this mess that you got here!
You'd better take this slow while Pull it all apart Well, you guys, I just brought you some little goodies to take along with you.
Oh, I'm certainly gonna miss you.
Thank you, Mrs. Trumbull.
Thank you very, very much.
Isn't that dandy?
Yeah.
Well, let's at least try to get out of here before it gets dark.
Well, Rick, you said You said you wanted to leave around and I think we can just about make it.
Yeah.
Now, Mother, you remember, if you have any trouble getting him to sleep, just sing to him in Spanish, huh?
I don't know any Spanish.
Oh, well, play one of Ricky's records.
Okay, here we go.
Okay, good-bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Good-bye, Mrs. Trumbull.
Don't forget to collect all the rents on the first of the month.
No, I won't.
And no matter how much they pound on the pipes, don't give them any more heat.
No, don't worry.
Okay, here we go!
I'll take care of everything.
Here we go!
Wait a minute, honey.
Let me kiss the baby once more.
All right.
Good-bye, sweetheart.
Bye-bye, darling.
Have a nice time.

Gee, this is interesting country.
I didn't know there were so many farms in Ohio.
Oh, sure.
Are you sure this is Ohio?
Well, it'd better be.
We just left Pennsylvania and we're headed for Indiana.
"50 Miles To Aunt Sally's Pecan Pralines".
Well, we're closing in on her!
The first sign we saw said, "200 Miles To Aunt Sally's Pecan Pralines".
I'm surprised she has time to make pralines; she's so busy making signs.
You know, I've been thinking about those pralines for so many miles, I just got to have some.
How about something to eat?
I'm hungry.
Oh, we've got to get more mileage today, Fred.
"Got to get more mileage today, Fred"!
Mileage.
Honey, we're all hungry.
Well, there'll be plenty of good places to eat up ahead.
"49 miles To Aunt Sally's Pecan Pralines".
Is there anything left in that lunch basket, Ethel?
A stale sandwich and a grape.
Let me have the grape.
Honey, when are you gonna stop and get something to eat?
We're hungry.
I'll stop at the next decent town we come to.
Oh, you've been saying that for the last hour.
Yeah.
I don't think I'll make it.
Me, either.
Hey, we still got that stale sandwich!
Don't bother looking in the cupboard, Mother Hubbard.
It's bare.
Fred, when did you eat that sandwich?
it's not safe to shut your eyes around here.
Wait a minute.
"One Mile To Aunt Sally's Pecan Pralines".
That's where we're gonna have dinner!
Oh, I can't make a meal out of pecan pralines.
Well, we can at least buy a bag to munch on until Mr. Mileage here decides to stop for dinner.
Well, that's a thought.
Anyway, we just got to drop in on Aunt Sally.
I feel like she's an old friend.
"300 Yards To Aunt Sally's"!
"200 Yards"!
"100 yards"!
"Just Around The Bend"!
"You Have Just Passed Aunt Sally's".
Passed!
Where was it?
I didn't see a thing!
Stop the car, Ricky, back up!
Okay.
Must be that shed over there.
There's a sign on the door, but I can't see it from here.
Drive on.
What did the sign say?
Out of business.
I knew Aunt Sally was spending too much money on those signs.
Hey, I think I see some lights.
Oh, I hope it's a cafe!
It is!
I hope it's a nice one.
Well, we're gonna stop there no matter what it's like.
Really, Ricky?
That a boy!
Yeah.
I'm hungry, too.
Boy, this place doesn't look any too hot, does it?
Well, we're here now, so let's give it a try, huh?
Oh, yeah, food, food.
Oh, at least they've got a great big selection of food.
Yeah.
Hey, I know what I want.
One of those steak sandwiches with some French fries and coleslaw.
Oh, a steak sandwich!
Hiya, folks!
Welcome to One Oak.
Welcome to One Oak.
Cabins and Cafe.
Yes, sir.
George Skinner at your service.
How do you do, Mr. Skinner?
Hello.
How do you do?
What'll it be?
Well, I'll have the steak sandwich, rare, with the French fries.
Uh, steak sandwich.
I'll have that, too.
I'll have the same.
Me, too.
We're all out of steak sandwiches.
Oh, you are?
Gee, I had my mouth all set for one.
Yeah.
Well well, I think I'll have the roast beef, rare, with a baked potato, then.
Roast beef, that's for me.
I'll vote for that.
Make it four.
We're out of roast beef, too.
Let me see here.
Hey, that fried chicken with biscuits sounds good.
Any point in running that chicken around the table?
All out.
Well, look, we're going at this thing all wrong.
Why don't you just tell us what you have and then we'll order.
All righty.
How about the specialty of the house?
What's that?
A cheese sandwich.
A cheese sandwich?
Is that all you've got?
I don't feel like a cheese sandwich.
Well, now, come on, folks, I can't wait all night.
What would you like?
The name of the nearest good restaurant.
Lucy, please.
Well Well, in fact, there is a place ten miles up the highway called "The Golden Drumstick".
The sign says, "Turkey dinner with all the trimmings, "dressing, cranberry sauce, green salad and homemade peach shortcake".
One dollar.
One dollar?
And only ten miles from here, you said?
Just ten miles?
Right on the highway, you can't miss it.
Oh, homemade peach shortcake!
That's for me.
Thanks for telling us about it.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Skinner.
Gee, how can they afford to serve all that for one dollar?
It's impossible.
That's why they went broke.
And there's not another thing clean to Cincinnati.
Well, group, what do you say?
Well, I'm so hungry I can't go another mile.
Oh, me either.
All right, Mr. Skinner.
Four specialties of the house.
Coming up.
Gee, I hope they're good.
Well, what can you do to a cheese sandwich?
I, uh, hope you didn't go to too much trouble.
Oh, no trouble.
I just buy them from the salesman when he comes around.
That salesman hasn't been around here lately, has he?
Let's get out of here, huh?
Yes.
Uh, how much do we owe you?
Well, let's see.
That's four specialties of the house.
Here you are.
$4.80!
Well, uh the sandwiches are a dollar apiece and 80 cents is the entertainment tax.
Entertainment tax!
Yup.
The whole show is just about to start.
Ah!
: Baby dear, listen here I'm afraid to go home in the dark Every day, the I'll pay!
I'll pay!
I'll pay!
I'll pay.
and the YMCA I'll pay.
Look, there you are.
Thank you very much.
There's your change.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Happy hunting.
Oh, dear.
What a character.
"Baby dear"!
Yeah.
Oh, I sure hate think to drive all the way to Cincinnati now.
Well, I'd take the wheel, Rick, but I'm too sleepy.
Well, let me drive, Ricky.
Well, I don't know, honey.
Oh, go on, there's no traffic now.
Okay.
I'll keep an eye on you.
Okay.
Next stop, Cincinnati!
Here we are.
Wake up, everybody, come on.
RICKY : No.
Wake up, we're here.
Come on, hurry up.
Everybody out!
Are we in Cincinnati?
No, sir.
We're at the Oh, no!
Uh, back in the car, everybody.
Back in the car.
Lucy, now, what is what's going on?
What are, what are you doing?
Well, I Oh, we're not back in the same place!
We are unless there's a chain of these across the country.
Oh, no.
Lucy!
Well, I was only trying to help.
I saw a sign that said, "Good accommodations, good food" and an arrow saying, "Take this road".
And somehow I wound up back here.
Well, as long as we're here, we're in no condition to continue.
We'll stay right here.
Here?
In Lower Slobovia?
Look, Fred, there's one good thing about this place.
It's here.
Let's make the best of it.
Come on.
I'm afraid to go I'm afraid to go I'm afraid to go Welcome back, folks.
I've been waiting for you.
What?
That sign I put up really works, don't it?
Takes you right around in a circle.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Look, uh, uh, we decided to stay here for the night.
We'd like a couple of cabins, please.
Well, I've only got one.
The price is eight dollars.
You only got one left?
I've only got one.
That's all I ever had.
It'll sleep four.
Well, let's take it.
I-I'm tired.
Well, it's only eight dollars.
Well, it'll be 16.
Eight dollars a couple.
Eight dollars, $16, who cares?
Oh, he is tired!
Come on.
Well, follow me.
Go ahead.
Well, here we are.
Well, back in the car, everybody.
Just a minute, just a minute, honey.
As long as we're here, we might as well stay here.
Sleep tight.
Thanks.
Who wants to sleep where?
It doesn't matter to me.
Me either.
Well, all right, all right.
We'll take the bunk.
Okay.
Okay, we'll take the bed.
Uh Maybe we'd better take turns changing in that room, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, yeah.
I'll go first.
Oh I forgot my toothpaste.
Oh.
Hey, honey, this bed doesn't look too bad.
I hope it isn't hard.
Whoa!
Oh, fine.
Well, at least it's a bed.
This isn't a bed, it's a canoe.
Oh, no!
I don't believe this.
Come over here, honey.
I'll help you up.
What was that?
Yeah.
Ethel, are you all right?
Ethel!
Ethel, I can't sleep up here.
Why not?
You know very well that high altitudes make my nose bleed.
High altitudes make him Oh, why didn't you say so before?
Well, I wanted you to warm the bunk up for me.
What a sneaky character I married!
Come on!
All right, all right.
Get on Get in there.
Can't get out under here.
I just don't like you being so tricky.
Oh, Lucy, Lucy!
Oh, oh!
Ouch!
You okay?
You all right?
Yes.
Ricky, what side of the bed do you want to sleep on, honey?
I don't care.
Okay.
Hey, get over on your own side of the bed.
Well, that's easier said than done.
Ahh!
Oh!
What are we gonna do, honey?
I don't know.
It's another train.
It must be another train.
What are you doing over here?
Come on, let's push the bed back.
Wait a minute.
Here comes another train the other way.
It's coming the other way now!
Coming again.
I wonder if this bed stops in Chicago.
Let's try to get some sleep.
Maybe that was the last one.
Where's my pillow?
Right here.
Okay.
Ahh!
I can't sleep in this hole!
Rick, Rick, What?
our mattress is just like that at home.
We'll trade with you.
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Come on.
Come on, we'll trade.
Thank you, honey.
Thank you very much.
Whoa!
What's going on?
What  Get up, Fred.
What?
Get up.
We're gonna trade with them.
Get up for what?
Come on, come on.
Oh what Come on.
You take the bed now.
Take the bed.
Lie down.
No, wait just a minute now.
Come on.
Now!
Go!
Hey!
You do that every night?
Yeah, but it took years of practice.
Ricky Ricky.
Hmm?
The baby's crying.
See what's the matter with him.
Okay, honey.
No I don't know what we're gonna do.
Hold on, everybody, hold on!
Here it comes, the next one.
Here it comes!
I don't know about you, but I'm getting out of here!
Me, too, I'd rather sleep in the car.
$16 down the drain.
Oh, no, I'm not gonna pay him $16 for this.
I'm gonna sue him for renting it to us.
Yeah.
You mean we're gonna sneak out of here?
Yeah, he'll never know!
Come on, get your coat out.
Fred, wake up!
Wake up, Fred!
Fred, wake up!
Fred!
Is it morning already?
No, come on.
How can he sleep through all that?
Somebody tied a string to the car.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
Somebody tied a string here.
Bust it.
Yeah.
It's all right, honey.
It's all right, honey.
Oh!
It's all right.
He had a burglar alarm hooked up in there.
I feel like I'm breaking out of prison.
Let's get out of here.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, come on, jump in, honey.
Oh, no.
Huh?
What's the matter?
Our steering wheel is missing.
It's gone!
Our steering wheel is gone!
You folks lose something?
You give us back our steering wheel!
Your steering wheel?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You do, too!
You took it off just to keep us here!
Well, you-you-you've got an awful suspicious mind to think that we'd try to get away in the middle of the night.
What kind of people do you think we are anyway?
!
Lucy Hey, hey, honey, honey, we..
Yeah, well Oh, Oh.
What made you think we'd sneak away?
Well, everybody does.
You know, if you didn't like that cabin, you don't have to pay me the $16.
Really?
Oh, well, uh Well, gee, that's very nice of you.
That's a rotten shame your steering wheel being stolen.
You know, I just happen to have an extra one here.
I'll let you have it for $16.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Lucy, I tell you, we're lost.
Shh!
You want to wake them up?
We are not lost.
Well, then, Highway 60's lost.
None of the roads we've been on for the last hour are even on the map.
I'll bet we're either in Canada or Mexico.
Oh, Ethel, stop.
The service station man will tell us how to get back on the highway.
Well, where is he?
I don't know.
Howdy, folks.
How are ya?
Shh!
I heard you.
I heard you.
What?
What?
What?
Eh, what can I do for you?
Where are we?
What's the matter?
Uh, nothing's the matter, dear.
Everything's fine.
We just stopped for some gas.
Go back to sleep.
Well, this ain't no gas station.
I live here.
You live here?
Yep.
For the past seven years, ever since they condemned this road.
Oh.
Lucy, where are we?
Uh, uh, where are we?
Uh, where are we, Ethel?
Oh, uh I don't know.
I wasn't paying much attention.
Shucks, you're in Tennessee.
Tennessee?
Tennessee?
Tennessee?
Tennessee?
You got here from Highway 60?
!
Yeah.
But there ain't no roads.
Hey, you must have come across that mountain in them old loggin' ruts.
How'd you do it?
'Tweren't easy.
Tell me, uh, where is the next city?
Well, uh, you can get to Nashville from here.
You-you go straight down here a piece un-until you get to that big road and you stay right on it and it'll take you right through Bent Fork.
Mm-hmm.
Bent Fork?
Bent Fork?
Bent Fork?
Bent Fork?
There goes that echo again.
Yeah, well, back over those old loggin' ruts.
Oh, no, Lucy.
Listen, Ethel, Bent Fork is Ernie Ford's hometown.
If we run into him, we'll never get to California.
Hey, do you folks know my cousin Ernie?
Oh, yeah, we know him.
He stayed overnight with us for a couple of weeks once.
Well, don't you like him?
Oh, we love him, but, uh, we, uh we don't want to run into him.
He'd make us, uh, move right in.
Well, Cousin Ernie's like that.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, look, uh, is there any other way to get back to civilization without having to go through Bent Fork?
Well uh, let's see.
You're here.
You're gonna Nope.
You can't get there.
Okay, come on, I'll drive.
Let's go.
What do you mean, you'll drive?
We're not taking any chances.
We're gonna go through Bent Fork, but as Cousin Ernie would say, "We're going through like a bobcat with a burr under his tail".
Now get!
That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of.
Shh!
We were not speeding at all.
You have no right to arrest us!
Yeah, well, that'll be up to the sheriff.
Yeah, well, we'll just see what the sheriff has to say about this.
It's just our word against yours, you know?
I got to make up my report.
Yeah, well Now, look, honey, I know these little towns.
Now, the best thing for us to do is say we're guilty, pay the fine and get out of here.
He's right, Lucy.
No!
It's a matter of principle!
Never mind that.
There we are.
There's the report.
You see, uh, I'm not, uh, normally the arresting officer.
He's sick today.
I'm normally the sheriff.
Eww!
I'll handle this.
Now, uh, let's see here.
According to this report, by the officer who arrested you Oh, that's all, brother.
Now, just a minute, young lady.
This is a court of law and order and I'm aiming to run it as honest as is humanly possible.
Ha!
Now, you're charged with driving lickety-split down the main road of Bent Fork at 40 miles an hour.
Guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Not guilty.
That's impossible.
You was in the same car, wasn't you?
Was your side of the car going slower than his'n?
No.
My side was going the same speed as his'n.
Was you a-driving?
No.
Well, then hesh up.
I won't hesh up.
Hesh up!
I won't!
I just happened to be looking at the speedometer at the time and we were not going 40 miles an hour!
Oh, is that so?
Well, now, how fast would you say you were driving?
Well uh Let me help you.
35?
Less.
Thirty-four.
Thirty-three?
Thirty.
Well, you wasn't backing through town, was you?
No.
30 Sounds about right.
I mean, 30.
That's what it was.
30.
All right.
Now I wasn't brung up to doubt the word of a lady.
If you say it's 30, 30 it is.
Well, that's better.
All right.
The charge now reads going through town at 30 miles an hour.
That's right.
Well, the speed limit is 15 miles an hour.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
The fine will be $50.
$50?
!
$50?
!
You tourists got to learn not to go boring through here like you was the governor with a police escort.
All right.
Here.
Don't you pay that.
Shh!
Now, looka here, young lady.
Don't you get my dander up.
Well, you've got my dander up!
You have no right to fine us $50!
That's enough!
If you so much as say "boo", I'm going to waltz you right into the pokey.
Here.
Come on, let's go.
All right.
Boo.
Are you crazy or something?
!
Into the cooler you go for 24 hours.
Oh, now wait a minute.
You can't mean that.
I certainly do.
Oh, she just does things like that all the time.
She hasn't got much sense.
Yeah, well Come on.
Oh Ricky!
What do you want me to do?
!
Well, call Ernie Ford.
Oh?
Do you know Ernie Ford?
Well, we certainly do, don't we?
!
Oh, yeah.
Good old Cousin Ernie.
He's one of our best friends.
Yeah, yeah.
Do you know him?
I should say I do.
Well, how about that?
!
He knows Cousin Ernie.
Yeah, fine, fine.
Yes, sir.
That no-account hound dog.
He jilted one of my daughters, and since you're such a good friend of his'n, you can just set in there for 48 hours!
Come on.
Right in here.
Well, there's just one thing to do, Ricky.
Go on without me.
Oh, now, honey, don't be silly.
Go ahead.
You could send me a postcard now and then, and tell me what Hollywood is like and Ethel, say hello to Clark Gable for me.
Maybe on your way back, you could stop, and by that time, I'll be paroled.
Oh, now, honey, don't feel that way.
We'll think of something, honey.
Don't worry.
Gee, folks!
Howdy-do?
!
Ernie!
Hey!
Cousin Fred.
Hi, Ernie.
Cousin Ethel.
Cousin Ricky.
Hi, Ernie.
And Cousin Jailbird.
Hi, Ernie.
How'd you know we were here?
Oh, it's the biggest news in town.
Oh, you're all over town.
Biggest news since the preacher dropped his uppers in the well.
Ernie, we're in an awful mess.
The sheriff put Lucy in jail for 48 hours for being sassy.
Yeah, I couldn't help it.
He made me so mad.
Well, he makes everybody mad.
He's about as popular as a skunk at the picnic.
Well, he doesn't seem to like you very well.
Listen, have you got any ideas on how we could get Lucy out of jail?
Don't you worry, amigo.
Like the United States Murines, I have come prepared.
Prepared for what, Ernie?
Shh.
Don't cut yourself now.
There.
There.
What do you want us to do with these?
Saw through them bars.
Oh, that'll never work.
Cousin Fred, it is time for desperate measures.
You've heard of being up the creek without a paddle?
We ain't even got a boat.
Yeah, yeah, Ernie's right, Fred.
Come on, let's give it a try.
Yeah, okay.
Oh, geez!
Not yet!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I could have swore I heard a suspicious sound.
Oh?
I never heard nothing suspicious.
Did you kinfolks?
No.
Oh, no.
Everything here is natural.
Not a thing.
Very quiet out here.
Now you see there, Sheriff?
You're, you're a-hearing things that ain't there again.
Just like you thought you hear them wedding bells a-ringing out.
Hesh up, you coward.
Hmm.
Any law against serenading a cousin in your pokey?
No.
No more than there's a law against a weasel breaking his word to womanhood's fairest flower.
That'll stick in old sour-jaw's craw the rest of his living days.
Now, look, here's what we're gonna do.
Come here.
Lucy, you work with her.
I'm going to sing a song and everybody sing and make lots of noises.
Yeah, yeah.
and you get down there eventually.
Okay.
We have to sing, too?
You sing and sing loud.
: Ah, Cousin Lucy, are there a favorite song that you'd like for me to pick and sing?
Uh, uh, how about, uh, "Old MacDonald Had a Farm"?
Happens to be number one on my repertory.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Old MacDonald had a farm E-i-e-i-o And on this farm, he had a pig E-i-e-i-o With an oink-oink here and an oink-oink there Here an oink, there an oink, everywhere an oink-oink Old MacDonald had a farm E-i-e-i-o Ernie it's much too fast.
Slow it down.
Old MacDonald had a farm E-i-e-i-o And on this farm, he had a duck E-i-e-i-o With a quack-quack here and a quack-quack there Here a quack, there a quack, everywhere a quack-quack Oink-oink here, oink-oink there Here an oink, there an oink, everywhere an oink-oink Old MacDonald had a farm E-i-e-i-o.
One more.
One more.
One more.
Old Macdonald had a farm E-i-e-i-o And on this farm he had a A saw.
Saw E-i-e-i-o With a buzz-buzz here and a buzz-buzz there Here a buzz, there a buzz, everywhere a buzz-buzz Quack-quack here, quack-quack there Here a quack, there a quack, everywhere a quack-quack Oink-oink here, oink-oink there Here an oink, there an oink, everywhere an oink-oink Old MacDonald had a farm E-i-e-i-o O  E-i-e-i-o.
Say, that song certainly cheered me up.
Ha, ha.
You know, music makes me feel kindly toward folks.
Oh, good, good.
Folks, not weasels.
Yeah.
You liked, you liked the song, eh?
Oh, I liked it fine, yeah.
Yeah, well, why don't you go back in your office and we'll serenade you some more, Sheriff.
Yeah.
: Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay That's awfully nice of you, but, uh, I feel a little guilty.
I-I was a little, uh, hot-headed back there a while ago.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna let the little lady out.
You are?
Yeah.
Out of the way, weasel.
There you are, young lady Write me a letter Send it by mail Send it in care of Birmingham Jail Ernie.
Birming Ernie.
Huh?
Look, cousin, would you mind stop singing a minute?
I like your voice and everything, but, you know, I'm kind of upset.
Well, you ain't half as upset as I am.
You can lay the blame for this whole mess right on my front doorstoop.
Aw, Ernie, you mustn't feel that way.
Well, I do.
Here you drive all the way down here to Bent Fork to see me and you was all teeth to see your old cousin again and you just come a-thunderin' into town like a runaway mule train, and what happens?
You get yourself arrested.
Now, ain't that the cotton-pickin' end?
Yeah, that's the cotton-pickin' end.
Now, look, it's my fault.
I got you into it and I'm gonna hatch up something to get you out of it.
Roses love sunshine, violets love dew Ernie?
Ernie?
Huh?
Do you have to cackle while you hatch?
Cousin Fred, I can't help it.
Singing is the way I get my brain cells to leaping.
I'm a-singin' on the outside, but I'm a-thinkin' on the inside.
Angels in heaven, oh Ha!
What?
What?
I got it, I got it.
In just a few minutes, you're going to be breathing the free air of Bent Fork once again.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Oh, let me tell you something.
I'm a-gonna marry the sheriff's daughter.
Oh, no.
Oh, Ernie, you'd do that just for us?
Yeah, well, it won't be so bad.
Teensy's kind of pretty-- Teensy, that's her name-- oh, she's got skin like fresh-churned buttermilk.
Well, it doesn't sound so bad.
Well, she's not bad Come on, girls.
Teensy, Weensy, come on.
Daddy, yes, Daddy.
You can't do it, boy!
You can't do it!
I won't let you, boy.
I said I's a-gonna do it and I'm a-gonna do it.
Sheriff!
Sheriff!
Sheriff!
!
What's the matter?
Hush up!
What's all this caterwaulin'?
Nothing, Sheriff.
Nothing.
Just playing a game.
I want to talk to you.
I ain't got nothing to say to you.
It's about your daughter's future.
Huh?
Well Come on out.
There.
Now, what was it you wanted to talk about, son?
See here.
Come on into my office, Ernie boy.
Hi, Ernie.
Hi.
Is it all over?
Yup.
What happened?
Well, I went in there and I took Teensy aside, and I proposed to her.
Oh, Ernie.
And I was that surprised when she turned me down.
What?
She turned you down?
Yeah.
Why?
It was Weensy and she can't stand the sight of me.
Oh, well, how did that happen?
Well, I had a hold of the wrong one.
They're as alike as two peas in a pod or two watermelons in a patch.
So, when I seen that I had a hold of Weensy I turned her loose, walked right around her-- which is no small trip-- and I proposed to Teensy, and she turned me down.
She said, "I ain't a-gonna play second fiddle".
Oh.
Oh.
Well, what do we do now?
Well, now, here's the way I've corked the jug.
Now, now, Weensy and Teensy are just a-dyin' to get into the movin' pictures and, huh, they're just made for the wide screen.
Yeah?
So, I told the sheriff that you'd just be delighted to haul them into Hollerwood with you.
What?
Ernie, we can't do that.
Oh, Ernie!
You can't?
Of course not.
That's out of the question.
Oh, and the sheriff's out here, inviting everybody in the county for a big farewell party for the girls.
Oh, Ernie, we couldn't do that.
Ernie, go go get him, will you?
Tell him to call it off!
Hey, have you any idea where the sheriff might be?
Nope.
"Nope".
Ooh-whee!
Ernie, oh, boy, am I glad to see you.
Did you find him, Ernie, huh?
No, I didn't find him.
I got me a horse, and I followed him from farm to farm, and I never did catch him.
Past hour, I've been a-ridin' on a solid blister.
You can call me "tall in the saddle".
Oh, what are we gonna do?
Hey, hey, here comes the music fellas!
Oh, the music fellas, they got the whole thing Hey, boys, come here, come here.
Here, here.
Come here.

Good.
Good.
There he comes.
Oh, Sheriff, Sheriff He won't He won't Oh, say, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was so excited about the party an-and losing my two daughters that I plumb forgot to let you loose.
Yeah, but look, Sheriff, look.
Come here a minute, would you?
I want to speak Yeah?
to you.
Look, I didn't tell Ernie that I was going to take the girls to Hollywood.
As a matter of fact Well, just a minute there.
I don't blame you a mite, son.
You haven't seen them perform.
You just want to be sure they got talent, eh?
Yeah, well, now, look.
Girls, come in!
Teensy?
Weensy?
Come here.
Come out here.
Yes, Papa.
Yeah, yeah.
Mr. Ricardo wants to see you perform.
Oh, sure.

All right.
Ernie, you have the boys fire the first shot.
Would you just listen for a minute?
Please, please, listen.
A-one, two, three, four.
They warned me when you kissed me Your love would ricochet Aha!
Your lips would find another And your heart would go astray I thought that I could hold you With all my many charms But then one day you ricocheted To someone else's arms And, baby I don't want a ricochet romance I don't want a ricochet love If you're careless with your kisses Find another turtledove I can't live on ricochet romance No, no, not me If you're gonna ricochet, baby I'm gonna set you free.
Ha, ha.
Yay.
Fine, dear, fine.
Well, uh, Mr. Ricardo?
Well, uh, yeah, well, um Yeah, it's gonna be a little difficult to 'splain to you this, Sheriff.
Sheriff, you see, it's got nothing to do with the girls.
You see, this is the first time that I'm going out to Hollywood myself.
I-I don't know anybody out there.
I don't even know anything about the place or Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What are you trying to get at?
Well, Sheriff, I'm trying to tell you that I cannot possibly take your girls with me.

{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Listen, where's Fred and Ethel?
I want to get going.
Well, Ethel went down to call her father in Albuquerque to tell him that we're arriving late this afternoon.
Hi.
Oh.
Oh, there they are.
Oh, here they are.
Hi, Rick.
I'll go get the car.
Okay.
Well, Ethel, did you talk to your father?
For 20 minutes.
Oh, he was so thrilled.
Gee, I haven't talked to Daddy for so long, hearing his voice made me cry.
Hearing the amount of that phone bill's gonna make me cry.
Now, Fred.
Gee, I'm anxious to meet him.
Oh		 What's he like?
Well, let me put it this way.
With him in Albuquerque, I'm surprised they don't have another Indian uprising.
Now, Fred!
Fred and Daddy never did see eye to eye.
Daddy didn't want us to get married.
Oh?
Fred, he's all over that by now.
He's forgiven us for eloping.
I haven't forgiven him for not stopping us.
Now, listen, smart aleck, you've forgotten that while we're visiting Daddy, the room and the meals will be free.
Oh, on to Albuquerque.
Okay, the car's ready.
Great.
Long-distance, please.
What are you doing?
I'm calling Mother.
But you called her yesterday.
Well, yesterday was a whole day ago.
I want to find out how the baby is.
Operator, would you give me New York City?
This is long-distance.
It costs a lot of money to call long-distance.
Yes, dear, I will.
She calls every day like we was in the next-corner drugstore or something.
Hello, Mother.
Hello.
This is Lucy.
Lucy!
Lucy Ricardo.
We have a bad connection.
With your mother, it's always a bad connection.
Mother, Mother, this is Lucy, your daughter.
Lucy Ricardo!
No, no, dear, no message.
I know she's on her way to California.
This is me!
Mother, it's your daughter, Lucille McGillicuddy.
Hello, mother.
How are you?
Now that she knows who you are, hang up.
Uh, how's the baby, dear?
Oh, I'm fine.
Yeah, well, give the baby my love, will you?
And Ricky's love.
Well, all right, Mickey's love.
Yeah, and, uh, Aunt Ethel's love and Uncle Fred's love.
Now that everybody loves everybody, hang up.
All right, all right.
Mother, I have to g Mother?
Mother!
What happened?
Were you cut off?
Well, what's going on, honey?
This is long-distance.
Well, she went to get the baby so I could tell him myself.
Ay-ay-ay.
Well, I want to hear the baby's voice.
Hello?
Hello, darling.
He said "hello"!
Good.
You say good-bye.
No, look, see if he'll say "hello" to you.
Hello, son.
He said it!
Ethel, Fred, come here!
Listen to this!
He said "hello"!
At these prices, you're going broke.
Oh, never mind that.
He said it clear as a bell.
Little Ricky, say hello to, to Uncle Fred and Aunt Ethel now.
Say hello.
Hello, Ricky.
Hi, Ricky.
LITTLE  Hello.
He said it!
Yeah, I heard it!
You hear him?
Yeah.
How do you like that?
What a kid.
What a conversationalist.
Only two years old, he's talking halfway across country.
Halfway across country!
Good-bye, son!
Come on, now.
Let's hit the road, huh?
On to Albuquerque.
Come on, let's go.
I'll take that big case.
Ah!
Oh!
Daddy, oh!
My little Ethel Mae!
I'm so glad to see you!
I can't believe it's you!
I thought we'd never get here.
My, my, you're a sight for sore eyes.
Oh Daddy you remember Fred.
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Hiya, curly.
And, uh, these are my best friends, the Ricardos.
How do you do, Mr. Potter?
How do you do?
You must be Lucy.
Now, there's a shrewd piece of deduction.
And Ricky!
Yes, sir.
?
Como esa?
?
Como esta?
Very good.
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.
Really?
Yes.
Well Thank you.
Well, let's all sit down, get the load off our feet.
Okay, sure.
You sit there, Fred.
You sit anyplace you want to and you sit right by me.
All right, honey.
Oh, I thought we'd never get here from Amarillo.
Oh, it's been such a long day.
Ethel, is this you?
Yep.
That's my baby when she was the flower of Albuquerque-- the most popular girl in town.
Why, they even elected her Miss Albuquerque of 19 Daddy.
Huh?
She was pretty popular, huh, Mr. Potter?
Popular?
Ha!
She was so popular, the boys used to buzz around her like bees around honey.
She could have had her pick of any fella in town.
And when I stop to think how she Oh, what's the use of going back?
Well, how come, with all the bees around her, I was the one that get stung?
Stung?
Now, look here, you Daddy, Daddy Fred, please don't..
Mr. Potter, uh, uh, this is the first time that we've been around this part of the country, you know.
Yes.
We've never been down-- even around Albuquerque at all.
Really?
Yeah.
You know very well she was popular.
Why, she could have married the best of them.
There was that Deke, Deke What's his name?
Deke Arledge.
Yeah, and Hank Spear and Bill Hackett.
Oh, say, he's the editor of the paper now.
He is?
!
Oh, I almost forgot.
He's coming over.
He'll be here in a few minutes.
Billy Hackett?
Yeah, Billy Hackett.
Oh Yes, sir.
When I told him that you were coming through town with the Ricardos, nothing would do but that he'd come over and get an interview.
: Really?
Yeah.
Oh, the whole town's in an uproar over this visit.
Is that so?
I even got so excited, I didn't go to the store this morning.
I run a little sweetshop and soda fountain.
Yeah, our slogan is, "You can lick our cones, but you can't beat our sodas".
Yeah, it isn't every day when we get a celebrity that comes to our town.
: Oh, well I hope that they're not gonna make, uh, too much of a fuss about it.
I hope they don't go overboard.
Yeah.
Oh, yes, they but they're all going all out.
Oh, they,	Really?
they're going all out.
How about that?
Sure.
They even wanted to know if you'd put on a show.
A show?
!
Sure.
How about it, Ricky?
Oh, that would be fun.
Let's do it.
All right.
Ha, ha, ha!
I already told them you would.
It's all set up for tomorrow night.
Oh.
Oh, you ought to see the marquee on the little theater.
You haven't any idea what it says.
What does it say?
"Ethel Mae Potter: We never forgot her".
"Ethel Mae Potter"?
That's, uh that's all it says?
Yeah.
Why?
Oh, nothing.
It's just, you know, when you said, uh, "celebrity," you know, I figured that maybe Oh, well, Ethel Mae is very big here in Albuquerque.
She's big everywhere.
Now, Daddy, you're exaggerating.
Why, I haven't done anything to speak of since I was in vaudeville.
Oh, yeah?
Well, how come you're on your way to Hollywood to star in a movie?
Uh Star in a movie?
Uh, Daddy, you misunderstood.
Ricky's going to be in the picture.
Oh, you're gonna be in it, too?
Well, I wouldn't exactly put it that way.
Aw, now, don't you worry.
If Ethel says that you're gonna be in her picture, you're gonna be in her picture.
That's nice.
Oh, Daddy, you got it all wrong.
Well, that's what you wrote.
No, what I meant was, Ricky is the star.
I'm just a oh, a There's my daughter for you: modesty personified.
She hasn't changed a bit.
No, sir, she always was a shrinking violet.
Now, honey, never mind the false modesty.
Go ahead, tell us about your picture.
Yeah, Ethel, tell us about your picture.
Yeah.
Um If Billy Hackett's coming over, I want to freshen up just a little.
I'll fix my hair up a little Uh Oh, Ethel Mae, take your old room.
We haven't touched it since you left.
It must be a nice dusty mess by now.
Say, if you folks will just make yourselves at home I'm going to run to the candy store and tell everybody how wonderful Ethel Mae looks.
Okay.
Hmm.
Ethel Mae's picture.
How do you like that?
Oh, come now, what difference does it make if her father thinks it's her picture?
Why, she didn't even try to deny it.
Well, she didn't want to make her father look bad.
Why not?
Everybody knows he's full of baloney.
Oh, come on now.
Promise me one thing.
When the man from the newspaper gets here to interview you, you make Ethel look good.
You tell him that she's gonna be in the picture, too.
Well  There he is.
Now, remember, mention Ethel as much as you can.
All right.
And, honey, when he takes your picture, you insist that Ethel be in it, too.
Okay, dear.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm Billy Hackett of the Chronicle.
How do you do?
I'm Lucy Ricardo.
How do you do?
This is Ricky Ricardo and Fred Mertz.
How do you do?
How are you?
Well, I've wanted to know you for a long time.
Thank you.
Yes, sir, I've always wanted to shake the hand of the man who married Ethel Mae.
Well, you, uh you got the wrong fella.
That's him over there.
Oh, you're the winner!
Yeah, I'm the winner.
And you're Ricky Ricardo!
That's right.
Well, I've got a lot of questions I want to ask you.
Oh, certainly.
Sit down.
Anything you want to know.
All right.
How long have you known Ethel Mae?
Well, now, let me see, um  Billy Hackett!
Ethel Mae!
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Oh, this is wonderful.
My daddy told me you were coming over.
Oh, it's been so long.
Ethel Mae, you were never prettier.
I can't argue with that.
I'd like to get a few pictures.
Oh, fine.
Would you stand right over there?
Right over there where, uh, Mr. Ricardo is.
Yes.
Get a nice informal shot of you.
Now, just relax there and let me have a little Mr. Ricardo, would you mind moving just a little bit to your right, please?
Sure.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Now, sm I'm sorry, Mr. Ricardo, but you're still in the picture.
All right, now smile.
Got it!
Oh, good.
Hey, how about getting that group of us?
I've always wanted a good picture of all of us together.
Oh, that's fine.
Right here.
Here?
Everybody gather around Ethel Mae, huh?
You just stand where Billy tells you to.
Now, just get Put your arms around her.
Get all close together, you know.
You fix 'em.
Very informal.
Right around me.
Put your arms around Ethel Mae, please.
Right there.
Thank you very much.
There we are.
Now   Got it!
Oh, that ought to be a good one.
Now, for the big story.
Sit down, Ethel Mae.
Local girl makes good.
Ethel Mae Potter reaches stardom in Hollywood.
Now, I want to know the story, the human story in back of this.
How did you get there?
How did it happen?
Uh, was it a tough road and was it worth it?
Now, those are the things that your friends from Albuquerque are waiting to hear.
Yeah, your friends from New York are waiting to hear it, too.
Yeah.
Well, tell me, Ethel Mae, and I'll put your story on the front page tomorrow.
Um Go ahead, Ethel Mae, tell him your story.
Yeah.
Well, uh Oh Um "My Story," by Ethel Mae Potter.
You people who remain here in this lovely, quiet, peaceful town of Albuquerque leading your dreary, uneventful lives, little do you know the heartache, the heartbreak, the hard work, the frustration that I went through to get where I am today.
When I was a small tot playing around the yard of the Albuquerque Grammar School, little did I know that I was destined to become the star of three continents.
That's wonderful!
And it gives me a great idea.
I am gonna make a series of pictures of you all over town.
We'll take them in the, in the schoolyard where you once played and one in back of the counter of your, of your father's sweetshop Oh, that's wonderful.
And then we'll top it off with a, with a big close-up shot of the little theater marquee.
Oh, that'll just be great!
Well, come on, let's do it!
Right now?
Why, certainly.
Oh, fine.
See you later, dears.
Isn't she something?
I think she's blown her top.
What do you suppose got into her?
I don't know, but somewhere along the line, shrinking violet got sanforized.
Why, she's raving mad.
We'd better get out of this joint before she starts foaming at the mouth and bites somebody.
Yeah, we'll leave tomorrow night right after the show.
You mean we're still gonna do the show?
You're darn right we're gonna the show.
I'm not gonna leave this town with everybody thinking that I'm Ethel Mae's chauffeur.
Now, I tell you what we're gonna do What?
I'll do an opening number, and then you do something.
Then I'll sing "Babalu," then you do something.
Then I'll sing "Grenada," then you and Fred  Hey, Liberace.
Where is Ethel?
I want to start rehearsing.
Oh, she went out with the mayor to cut the tape on a new road into the Indian Reservation.
Ay-ay-ay.
Ricky!
Yeah, honey?
Fred!
Yeah?
Listen to this.
What?
"Glamorous star visits here on way to film capital".
Well, what did you expect after yesterday's interview?
I'll bet she doesn't even mention us.
Oh, yes, she does.
"Ethel Mae Potter who has been called to Hollywood to star "in a wide-screen color spectacle is motoring to the coast with friends".
That's us.
How do you like that?
Oh, that's nothing.
Try this on for size.
"This evening Miss Potter will appear at the little theater in a solo recital of songs and readings".
Solo?
!
Boy, she's really flipped.
Yeah, well, there's more.
Remember the picture taken of all of us, the one with our arms around Ethel?
Yeah.
Hello.
We were cut out!
Yeah.
Either that, or Ethel's grown five more hands.
see you tonight at the show!
Oh, here comes our shrinking violet now.
Yeah, the little shrinker.
How.
They made her an Indian chief.
What's your name, Big Chief Hog-It-All?
What do you mean?
"What do you mean"?
We read the paper, dear.
Wasn't that write-up a lulu?
And what a lulu.
Yeah.
I especially liked the picture: "Ethel and her trained hands".
Yeah, thanks a lot for mentioning my name.
Now, just a minute.
I can't help what Billy Hackett put in the paper.
Freedom of the press, you know.
Freedom of the press, yes, but there wasn't a word of truth in it.
I beg your pardon.
There might have been a slight exaggeration here and there.
Oh, Ethel!
Ethel, what's come over you?
"Solo performance".
Are you crazy or something?
Now, I can explain.
Everybody wanted me to do something special-- something that I became famous for.
So, what with one thing and another, : there just wasn't room for all of you.
You know, you might have insisted that we be in the show.
Yes, I might have but I didn't want to.
That's it!
All right, come on.
We're leaving for California right now.
That suits me.
Now, just a minute!
I can't leave now.
Oh, that's right.
You have a show to do, haven't you?
Well, we'll see you on the coast.
Yeah.
How do I get out there?
Well, call your studio.
Maybe they'll send a special train for a big star like you.
Oh, I think you're all horrid!
Now, just a second, folks.
I'm sorry if Ethel Mae is so popular, there's no room for you, but, gosh, there must be something we can figure out you can do.
Yeah, maybe we could be ushers in the theater.
Maybe we can put on aprons and sell your candy in the lobby.
Say Oh, no.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I think we should stay.
What?
!
What?
!
Well, now, after all, this is Ethel's hometown, and we should help her make a good impression.
Now, just a minute.
What's the matter We'll stay, Ethel, and when you're on that stage tonight, remember, you've got us right behind you.
Well, now, that's very nice of you.
Thanks, Lucy.
Yeah, thanks.
Ethel Mae, get up and change your clothes.
We've got to go over to the sweetshop.
I'm naming a sundae after her.
Yeah, well What's the matter with you?
Have you lost your mind?
What did you want to say that for?
Now, fellas, I just got to thinking about our dear Ethel Mae.
Now, You know, it's very hard to carry a whole show all by yourself even if you're as big a star as she is.
She really needs somebody to back her up, and that's where we come in.
We'll be right behind her, on the stage.
Ladies and gentlemen, my friends, you don't know what a thrill it is for me to be on this stage tonight-- this stage where I got my start-- and I want you all to know that no matter how famous I become, I will never forget you or Albuquerque.
But enough of the sentiment.
On with the show.
For my first number tonight, I have chosen a number that all of you love to hear me sing.
I had many requests for your favorite and mine: "Short'nin' Bread".
Put on the skillet Put on the lid Mammy's gonna make a little short'nin' bread That ain't all she's gonna do Mammy's gonna make a little coffee, too Mammy's little baby loves short'nin', short'nin' Mammy's little baby loves short'nin' bread Mammy's little baby loves short'nin', short'nin' Mammy's little baby loves short'nin' bread Two little babies lyin' in bed Two of 'em sick and the other 'most dead Sent for the doctor The doctor said Feed those babies on short'nin' bread Oh, mammy's little baby loves short'nin', short'nin' Mammy's little baby loves short'nin' bread Mammy's little baby loves short'nin', short'nin' Mammy's little baby loves short'nin' bread I slipped to the kitchen I slipped up the lid I slipped to the kitchen for short'nin' bread I stole the skillet I stole the lid I stole the gal that makes the short'nin' bread Oh, mammy's little baby loves short'nin', short'nin' Mammy's little baby loves short'nin' bread Mammy's little baby loves short'nin', short'nin' Mammy's little baby loves short'nin' bread They caught me with the skillet They caught me with the lid They caught me with the gal makin' short'nin' bread Mammy's little baby loves short'nin', short'nin' Mammy's little baby loves short'nin' bread Mammy's little baby Loves short'nin', short'nin' Mammy's little baby loves Short'nin' bread.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Would you like for me to sing another song?
Oh!
Thank you.
I'll be very happy to.
Now, I think we should have a change of pace, don't you?
So, I'd like to sing an operatic song that I used to do: "My Hero," from The Chocolate Soldier.
Come, come I love you only My heart is true Come, come, my life is lonely I long for you  Come, come  Look at me face you My arms are aching  Long to embrace you My heart is thine Come, come, I love you only My hero  : Come Come I love you only My : Hero.
Ethel Mae!
Ethel Mae, you were wonderful.
And that comedy routine is sensational.
Ethel Mae, that's the funniest show I've ever seen on or off Broadway.
I want to get a picture.
Lucy, Fred, Ricky, come on out here!
I want to get a picture.
Get the stool, will you?
Ricky, you stand in the middle.
You here.
Just a little bit over here, honey.
That's it.
That's it.
That's fine.
Now let me see.
Here, give me the stool.
See if that looks all right.
Yes, that's fine.
Now come on.
You sit down here, right in the middle.
That's it.
That's the picture I want.
Ethel Mae Potter and Company.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Oh, look at this.
Isn't it beautiful?
Oh, Lucy, I never saw anything like this in my whole life.
Oh!
Oh, Ricky, the studio must think a lot of you to get you a suite like this.
Hey, not bad, huh, Fred?
Yeah, this is some class.
Did you see Van Johnson?
Where?
He got in the elevator just as we got off.
That wasn't Van Johnson.
It was, too.
It was not.
Wasn't that Van Johnson that got in the elevator?
No, ma'am, that was the house detective.
Oh.
Well, it looked just like him.
Everybody looks like a movie star to my wife.
Your room is down the hall.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Okay.
We'll see you later.
Oh, Ricky, this is so wonderful.
I hope you like your place.
I hope it's half as nice as this.
Bye.
See you in a little while.
Bye.
Oh, honey, I can't believe it!
We're really here.
And none of this would have happened if you hadn't been so talented, darling.
Oh, at least I know one movie star.
I know you're you.
Hey, wait a minute.
I'd better call the studio and tell them we're here.
Where's the phone?
Here.
Oh.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
Hollywood's out there!
: Yeah.
Operator, Hollywood 33449, please.
Ricky, come here.
Just a minute, honey.
Mr. Sherman, please.
Lucy, did the boy bring my little overnight bag?
Yeah, there it is.
Come here and look, Ethel.
Mr. Sherman, please.
Ricky Ricardo calling.
What's your room like?
Oh, it's lovely, but it doesn't have a view like this.
Look.
There's the Brown Derby.
: It is.
Yeah, and Grauman's Chinese Theatre's right up there.
See?
Oh, my!
Mr. Sherman, this is Ricky Ricardo.
We just got in.
Yeah.
Oh, yes, we had a wonderful trip.
Thank you.
Oh, by the way Ben Benjamin told me to give you his regards.
He's talking to the studio.
Oh, well, that sounds fine.
Yeah, I'd love to see what the studio looks like.
Uh, the Commissary at 12:00 for lunch.
All right.
I'll see you there.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Well, let's go.
Let's go where?
That's his idea of a Hollywood outfit.
Fred, I thought I took that stuff out of the bag in New York.
Well, I put them back in.
I've seen pictures of how they dress in Hollywood and I want to fit in.
I don't want to be conspicuous.
You go take that off.
I am not walking down the street with you in that flowered nightshirt.
Now, Fred, you'd better go change because we're all going to the studio for lunch.
No kidding?
Yeah.
Ricky just talked to the producer.
Oh.
Well, uh, uh, honey, uh, he-he didn't invite all of us.
Oh, dear.
Me and my big mouth.
I'm sorry, Ethel and Fred.
I thought you were gonna get to go, too.
Oh, darn it.
Well, that's the way the ball bounces.
Well, uh, honey, you're not going either.
Why not?
Well, because he just invited me.
Oh, darn it.
Well, that's the way the ball bounces.
Oh, shut up!
Honey, this is business today.
Oh, here we are in Hollywood and I don't get to do anything.
What am I gonna do this afternoon?
Well, for one thing, I need a clean shirt.
So, why don't you start unpacking?
And after the fun of unpacking wears off, what then?
Well, I tell you what.
You drop me by the studio, and then you can have the car for the rest of the afternoon and do whatever you like.
All right?
I'll go get ready.
Hey, that's a wonderful idea, huh?
Well, I suppose we could just drive up and down the streets and hunt movie stars.
Why not?
Although tracking them down one by one takes so much time.
I wonder if there's anyplace where they get together in a herd?
Well, maybe at sundown, they all gather at the same watering hole.
That's it!
That's where we'll go.
Where?
The watering hole.
Fellow hunters, we're going to the Brown Derby.
Thank you.
Gee.
Ooh, it's just like I imagined it.
Yes.
Well, come on, let's sit down.
I never really thought I'd be here.
Me either.
Come on, let's sit down, will you?
All right.
Oh, look.
Eddie Cantor.
: Yeah.
Oh, look at Jimmy Durante.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
They've used two frames for his schnozzola.
There's Cary Grant.
Where?
Right there.
It is.
Oh, you finally saw one.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
I have a feeling we've run into a whole nest of them.
Ethel, will you sit down and stop gawking?
You're acting like a tourist.
Well, I am a tourist.
Well, get hold of yourself.
Oh look at the salads!
Look at the pastries!
Look at the prices!
Don't worry, Fred, it's my treat.
Ricky gave me the money.
Oh, that's different.
Now I can look at this side of the menu.
Telephone for Gregory Peck.
Gregory Peck-- where is he?
I don't see him.
Well, he must be here.
He got a telephone call.
There he is!
There he is right in there.
See?
Oh, isn't he handsome.
Look.
He's smiling.
Awwww!
Aah, sit down, will you?
Oh, Fred, what's the harm?
They're movie stars.
They're used to being stared at.
Well, I guess he's right.
I guess if they come here to eat, they'd like to eat in peace.
Telephone for Walter Pidgeon.
Now, if you two johnny jump-ups don't sit down, I'm gonna eat by myself.
He isn't here.
Why do you have to be such rubbernecks?
They're just people like you and me.
Yeah.
I guess we'd better eat, huh?
Yeah.
Might as well decide what we want before the waiter gets here.
Yeah.
Oh, boy, I'm gonna have a piece of that.
Telephone for Ava Gardner.
Where?
Where's Ava?
Fred.
Fred, sit down.
Remember?
She's just people, like you and me.
Yeah.
She might be people, but she's not like you and me.
All right now.
Have you decided what you're going to have?
Oh.
Well, it's so hard to decide.
Everything is so tempting.
Uh, what is this Derby tossed salad?
Anybody knows that, Lucy.
You just take some salad and toss it in a derby.
It's a mixed green salad in an oil dressing.
Oh.
Well, I'll have that, please.
Yes, ma'am.
And then I'd like the spaghetti and meatballs.
Oh, that sounds good.
I'll have that, too.
Yeah, and lots of meat sauce, please.
Yes, ma'am.
I'd like the veal cutlet Marco Polo.
Veal cutlet.
Very well.
Have you been in pictures?
No, ma'am.
No?
Ethel.
Huh?
That picture on the end down there-- is that a picture of Shelley Winters or Judy Holliday?
The one on the end in the bottom.
I can't see the signature.
I think it's Shelley Winters.
Well, it looks more like Judy Holliday.
Well, what's the difference?
Ask that lady in the next booth.
Maybe she can tell.
Oh, for corn's sake.
Miss.
I'm sorry to bother you, but my friend and I can't see the signature on that last picture.
Is that Shelley Winters or Judy Holliday?
Neither.
That's Eve Arden.
Thanks.
Eve Arden.
Oh.
Oh, what she must think of me.
You touched her!
Ethel, what's the matter?
Who?
William who?
: William Holden, : behind you.
William Holden, behind me?
Oh, he's dreamy.
Oh William Holden.
Move around, please.
Oh.
Looks mighty tasty.
Mmm.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
If she wasn't pushing me, I could Are you ready to order yet Mr. Holden?
Yeah, Gus.
I'd like to start off with a Uh, a Cobb salad.
Yes, sir.
And, um a cup of coffee.
Yes, sir.
And, uh I don't have another booth, Mr. Holden.
It's all right.
You know, they say when they stop looking, that's the time to worry.
Yes, sir.
If I get another booth, Mr. Holden Don't worry about it.
You know, I sometimes wonder how a person like that would feel if, uh, the shoe were on the other foot.
Ha!
Wait a minute, that's an idea.
For once I'm gonna turn the tables.
Let's get out of here.
Well, I'm not through.
I don't care.
Waiter, check, please.
I'm not gonna leave all this good food.
I can't help it.
Put it in a sack and take it with you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The script looks fine, John.
Well, good, Bill.
I'm glad you like it.
Oh, Mr. Holden, Wardrobe had to send your coat out to be cleaned, but they sent this one up for you to wear home.
Oh, good.
Thank you.
How did you get covered with all that pie?
Were you on a television show?
No.
Oh, by the way, Ricky Ricardo's here.
He wants to show you his Don Juan costume.
Oh, fine.
Come on in, Ricky!
Mr. Sherman, it doesn't seem to me that this is quite the way to I don't think that this is going to work This isn't right, is it?
Of course not, Ricky.
Don Juan never wore armor like that.
He was supposed to be a great lover, wasn't he?
That's right.
Well, if I ever kissed a girl in this thing, I'd cut her nose off.
Don't worry about it, Ricky.
I'll straighten it out with Wardrobe.
Oh, uh, meet William Holden, Ricky.
Oh?
This is Ricky Ricardo, Bill.
How are you, Ricky?
Oh.
How do you do, Mr. Holden.
Very glad to know Excuse my glove.
Ricky's doing Don Juan for us.
Oh?
Say, I, uh, I think that's one of my old suits.
Yeah?
Only I hope you have a lot better luck with it.
You see, uh, one day on location, it rained, and on the way back, I rusted shut.
No.
And when they got back, they called me and said, "Come down to wardrobe.
We're opening a canned ham".
Canned ham-- that's pretty good.
I'll fix it up, Ricky.
Don't worry about it.
Listen, could I use your telephone a minute?
Yeah, help yourself.
I'd like to call my wife and have her come over to pick me up.
Sure.
What number do you want to dial?
Oh, uh, the Beverly Palms Hotel.
I'll have Wait a minute, Ricky.
I go right by there.
I can drop you off.
Oh, no, that'll be too much trouble.
It's right on my way.
Are you sure?
Sure.
Gee, thanks.
Say, if you're not in a rush, could you stop by for a moment?
Sure, I'd love to.
My wife is just dying to meet you.
Ah, here we are, Bill.
Oh, very nice.
Isn't it nice?
The studio got it for me.
Make yourself at home.
I'll go get Lucy.
Okay, fine.
Oh, hi, honey.
Hi, dear.
How was the studio?
Oh, wonderful.
How was the Brown Derby?
Uh, uh, oh, it was just swarming with movie stars.
I bet I saw more stars than you did at the studio.
Well, maybe so, maybe so, but, uh, I bet you didn't bring one home with you.
What do you mean?
Well, one of the biggest stars in the whole picture business is sitting in our living room right now.
Who?
William Holden.
What's he doing here?
I thought you'd be pleased.
I met him at the studio, he drove me home and he wants to meet you.
Well, I don't want to meet him.
Honey, what are you talking about?
I-I just don't feel like meeting him right now, that's all.
What's the matter, you sick or something?
Yeah, that's it.
I'm sick.
You got a headache?
Yeah.
Oh I mean Is it your head, or is it your stomach?
Well, it sort of jumps around.
Now, uh look, Lucy, what-what's going on?
Why-why don't you want to meet Bill Holden?
Well I know you're not shy.
Yeah, that's it.
I-I just found out.
I-I'm very shy about meeting movie stars.
You tell him to go away, and I'll see him in his next picture.
Lucy, I don't know what's got into you, but I know this: After Bill Holden was nice enough to drive home and come all the way up here to meet you, you're gonna go out there and meet him.
But I just can't.
Why not?
I just can't.
Why not?
!
Well, he never did appeal to me very much.
He just doesn't send me.
What are you talking about?
All I heard all the way across country was "Bill Holden, Bill Holden, Bill Holden".
Yeah, well, I'm fickle?
Come on.
You're gonna go out there and meet him right now.
No!
No, Ricky, please!
Come on.
No, Ricky, please!
Come on.
Well, listen, at least let me fix my face first.
All right, but hurry up.
Finally, they called me and they told me to come out and make the picture.
Well, I certainly want to wish you luck.
Thank you, Bill.
It's a wonderful studio to work for.
Well, that's good to hear.
You want some more coffee?
Yeah, a little more and then I'm gonna have to run.
I don't know what's keeping Lucy.
Oh, here she is.
Honey, I want you to meet William Holden.
Bill..
My wife Lucy.
How do you do, Mr. Holden?
How do you do?
You'll have to excuse my appearance.
I just washed my hair and I can't do a thing with it.
Well, uh, uh, uh you want some coffee?
Yes, please.
It's very exciting meeting you, Mr. Holden.
You're my favorite movie actor.
Well, thank you, Lucy.
I've seen you so many times, I feel that I know you.
You know, I have a funny feeling I know you, too.
Oh?
Oh.
Haven't we met somewhere?
Oh, no, no.
That's impossible.
Yeah, I guess it is, but, uh, there's something about you that's so familiar.
Oh?
Especially around the eyes.
Oh.
Here's your coffee.
Oh, thank you.
Uh, uh, Bill, what-what's the what's the last picture you made?
Well, we just finished shooting The Country Girl with Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly.
Oh, gee, that sounds wonderful.
Yeah.
I hope I get to see it.
Well, I hope if you do see it, you enjoy it.
Oh, well, I'm sure I will.
Would you, uh, like to watch a shoot?
What was that?
I said, would you like to watch a shoot sometime?
Oh!
Could I?
Why, sure.
Next time we have, you know, something interesting going on, I'll, I'll make arrangements and, uh Anything wrong, Mrs. Ricardo?
My nose itches.
This California sun certainly makes your skin soft.
Um, Ricky, uh, do you know, uh, yet who your costar will be?
Uh, no, no, I don't know, no.
They haven't decided that yet.
All they told me was that there was supposed to be five very beautiful women in the picture.
What do you think about that, Mrs?
Cigarette?
Lucy would you mind telling me what's going on?
Well, I guess I might as well tell you.
I went to the Brown Derby today That's it.
That's where I saw you.
The Brown Derby.
She was, um, sitting in the next booth, and, uh, I asked the headwaiter who the beautiful redhead was.
You did?
Yes.
I, uh, I wanted to find out your name and come over and tell you that you should be in movies, but, uh, you left before I had a chance.
Oh!
Oh, you're just wonderful!
Lucy.
Lucy, dear.
Um I don't know what's the matter with her, Bill.
I-I guess she's so excited.
Yeah.
She's never been this close to a move star before.
Yes.
You'll you'll have to forgive me, Mr. Holden.
I, I I kissed Bill Holden!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Oh, hello.
Here are the extra towels you wanted, Mrs. Ricardo.
Thank you very much.
Lucy?
Yeah?
Lucy!
What?
Come here.
Guess who's down by the pool.
Who?
Robert Taylor.
No kidding.
Yes.
Maybe we can see him from up here.
Come over.
Where is he?
There he is!
Where?
See that great big green- and-white-striped umbrella?
Yeah.
Well, you see those feet sticking out from under that umbrella?
Yeah.
Those are Robert Taylor's feet!
Robert Taylor's feet!
Yeah, and the rest of him's even better.
No kidding!
Well, get your bathing suit and meet me down by the pool.
Okay.
Oh!
Oh, I can't.
Ricky just called and-and he's, uh, he's on his way here from the studio with a photographer.
We're going to take some pictures.
"We"?
Are you going to be in them?
Well, I didn't get all the details.
But what other reason would they have for taking them here?
It's probably one of those fan magazine deals, you know, where they play up the domestic angle: "Lucy and Ricky Ricardo At Home".
Oh, that'll be wonderful.
Yeah.
Ethel.
Oh, for goodness sake, now, you could have gone into the wading pool until Mommy got there.
I want you to rub this oil on me so I can get a suntan.
Oh, Fred, you'll never get a suntan.
Your skin's just like mine.
It's too fair.
Well, it says right here if I use it, I'll be a golden brown.
You will-- a golden brown blister.
Well, I'm going to give it a try.
Now let's go.
Okay.
I want to get one more look at Robert Taylor.
He's gone.
He has?
Oh, darn it!
Now, let's go.
We're wasting that good sun.
Oh, there's no hurry.
Yes, there is.
They're here already?
Does Ricky Ricardo live here?
Uh, yes.
Yes, he does.
Well, I'm Dolores Donlon.
The studio told me to come over here to have some pictures taken with Ricky.
Oh.
Well, won't you come in?
Thank you.
Uh, I'm Mrs. Ricardo and this is Mr. And Mrs. Mertz.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Oh, well, come on.
We're wasting that good sun.
There's no hurry.
Oh, won't you sit down?
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello.
Is this the Ricardo apartment?
Yes.
Well, the studio said to come up and have some pictures taken.
Oh, hi, Dolores.
Hi, Maggie.
Did they call you for this, too?
Yeah, but I don't know much about it.
Me either.
The studio just said to go over and have my picture taken with Ricky Ricardo, whoever he is.
Oh, haven't you met him?
He's a handsome Latin with an accent.
He's the end.
Really?
The living end.
Uh pardon me.
I'm a little confused.
What kind of pictures are they taking?
Oh, are you from the studio, too, honey?
No, I'm Mrs. End.
I-I, I mean, I'm Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh.
Well, how do you do?
I'm Maggie Magennis.
Oh, well, how do you do?
This is Mr. And Mrs. Mertz.
Hello!
How do you do?
It's been nice knowing you.
We're going down to the pool.
What for?
I thought you said you wanted to get some sun.
With my fair skin?
Oh, this is Ricky, I hope.
Hello Yeah, yeah, come on in.
Hi, Dolores and Maggie!
How are you?
Good to see you.
Why are there so many of them?
Who cares?
Come on.
We're going down to the pool.
Wait!
Wait!
We'll see you later, Lucy.
Come in, Ross.
Oh, hi.
Hi, honey.
Ross Elliott, this is my wife Lucy.
How do you do?
Glad to meet you, Mrs. Ricardo.
Thank you.
Oh, hello, girls.
Hi, Ross.
How are you?
What are those?
Oh, well, they're going to be in the Don Juan picture with me.
Oh?
Yeah, they play the four women that are in love with me in the picture.
Oh, that's very exciting.
Ricky, come on over and meet the girls.
Okay.
Excuse me, honey.
Girls, this is Ricky Ricardo.
Hello, Dolores.
I met you before.
Hello, girls.
Hi.
Okay, kids, let's get started.
Now, Ricky, for the first shot, take this script and sit in that chair with the girls all around you, huh?
Okay.
Now, we'll see how that looks.
Okay.
Okay, kids.
That's good.
Now, one Mrs. Ricardo, if you stand there, you're gonna be in the picture.
Oh.
It's not that we wouldn't like to use you in some of the shots, but it just wouldn't fit in with our publicity campaign.
Oh, well, I-I thought you, uh, would want to play up the domestic angle.
You know, how happily married Ricky is.
Well, we-we would ordinarily, you see, but Don Juan is all about love.
It's got nothing to do with marriage.
Oh.
Okay, kids, let's get this now.
Ready?
One, two and Good.
Okay, now I think we'll have some cheesecake.
Everybody, over to the couch.
Ricky, you go get your guitar, huh?
Okay.
All right, kids.
Two on one side and two on the other.
Yeah, that's gonna be fine.
Now let's all cross our legs to the right, huh?
That's good.
Now leave space a little for Ricky.
Where do you want me, Ross?
Right in the middle, Ricky, serenading the girls, huh?
Everybody look at Ricky and smile.
Now hold it.
One two Mrs. Ricardo Well, you said everybody.
Well, I meant all the girls.
Oh.
Lucy well, I misunderstood him.
That's all.
Okay, all right.
One, two and good.
Now, for the next shot, let's have everybody back of the couch, huh?
Uh, well, if you don't need me, I have a few things I could be doing in the bedroom.
All right, Mrs. Ricardo, if we need you, we'll call you.
Thank you.
All right now, Ricky, you stretch out on the couch, looking up at the girls.
Girls, I want just the heads showing.
Okay.
Everybody down.
That's right.
Now, just the chin sticking up.
Just your chin.
Now, there.
Now, let's see how that's going to look.
Now, don't move, Beverly.
Now, I want you two to move over to the right and you three to Three?
!
Mrs. Ricardo.
Lucy, what are you doing back there?
I lost my earring.
Where?
In the bedroom.
What are you doing looking out here for it?
Because the light's better out here.
Okay, kids, let's get this shot, huh?
One, two Good.
Okay, now I think we'll move down to the pool.
Kids, change into your suits in the cabana.
Ricky, get into some trunks and a robe, huh?
Okay.
All right, fine.
Oh, it's nice to have met you, Mrs. Ricardo.
I'll see you again sometime.
Lucy?
Yeah.
Are you watching that spectacle from up here?
Isn't it revolting?
Will you please tell me what is so exciting about taking pictures of four starlets in bikini bathing suits?
I don't know, but I could see Fred's eyes bugged out clear up here.
Phew!
Boy, I'm glad that's over.
I never realized that taking pictures was such hard work.
Oh, you poor little thing.
I'll bet your arms are all calloused from having them around those starlets.
Honey, you know I had nothing to do with this.
Don't get mad.
Mad?
Me mad?
: Why?
Why should I be mad?
On the contrary, I'm glad, very glad.
Why, when those girls walked in here today, it was the happiest day of my life.
Now, Lucy And when they didn't want me in the pictures, I wanted to jump for joy.
Lucy And my goodness!
When you all put on those bathing suits and trooped down to the pool, I just felt as if my fondest dreams had come true.
Now, honey And you thought I was mad.
Why, I wasn't mad.
I was happy.
Happy!
H-a-p-p-y, happy!
Boy.
Now, look, honey, I-I know that you're a little upset, but A little upset.
You think I'm a little upset.
Now, just a minute.
Ricky, let her go.
I want to see what she'll do for an encore.
Now, look, honey, I-I know that this is hard for you to put up with, but, uh, it's part of the publicity campaign for the picture, and I got to go along with it.
Yeah, well, I don't got to go along with it.
Yes, you do.
You are my wife, and this is part of my career right now.
Now, there'll probably be a lot more pictures like that, but I'm sure that if you think the whole thing over calmly, you won't be childish enough to let it bother you.
Any bets?
You keep out of this.
Here.
Here's something to make you happy.
Ross gave me some tickets to go to a big premiere tonight, and we're going to get all dressed up and go.
We are?
Yes, sir.
I'm taking the prettiest girl in Hollywood to the premiere.
Aw honey.
Oh, I love movies with a happy ending.
Gee, Ethel, just think: My first Hollywood premiere.
Where is it, honey?
Grauman's Chinese Theatre?
He didn't tell me.
Look on the tickets and see.
Just one ticket here.
You sure?
I'm positive.
Oh, well, then it must be good for two people-- you know, one person and a guest.
Of course, dear.
That's why it says, "Admit one".
Oh.
Well, I almost got to a Hollywood premiere.
Now, honey, there's just been a mistake, that's all.
You bet there's just been a mistake, and I made it 15 years ago when Marion Strong asked me to go on a blind date with a Cuban drummer and I said yes.
Oh, hello, Ross.
Come in.
Say, Ricky, I just realized I only gave you one ticket for tonight.
See?
Oh.
Well I can't send you to a premiere all by yourself.
No, that's right.
You certainly can't.
Here you are.
One, two, three, four.
Four?
Four?
Yeah, for the four girls.
Now, look, Ricky, when they interview you in the lobby, mention Don Juan as many times as you can Now, now, look, Ross, Ross, I wanted to take Lucy to the premiere tonight.
Now, Ricky, I know how you feel, but I've got this thing all set up.
There'll be plenty of other premieres she can go to later on.
You understand, don't you, Mrs. Ricardo?
Oh, sure, I understand.
Oh, you're a real doll.
Now, look, Ricky, there's a party at the Mocambo after the show-- you and the four girls, okay?
Yeah.
I'll see you at the studio in the morning, huh?
Yeah, well, yeah I know.
I'm your wife, and I have to go along with it.
It's part of your career.
It's for publicity and I'm not supposed to let it bother me.
I shouldn't be childish and I should take it with a smile.
Lucy I'm smiling.
I don't like you when you're smiling that way.
Don't press your luck.
I'm smiling.
Oh, honey, you shouldn't have waited up for me.
Come on.
Let's go to bed.
Come on, honey.
I got an early call at the studio tomorrow.
Lucy, have I got a clean tux shirt?
Honey, I got to go to the studio in my tux, and I want Aah Ten o'clock!
Give me MGM Studio, please.
Hello.
Is Ricky Ricardo working there today?
Well, would you find him, please?
I-I'll hold on.
Oh, you're up.
Good.
Say, Ethel wants to know if we're still going to Knott's Berry Farm today.
The only knots you'll see today will be on Ricky's head!
Huh?
He didn't come home all night!
Oh, you must be mistaken.
Go see for yourself.
His bed hasn't been slept in.
Oh.
Well, of course it hasn't.
What do you mean?
Well, that's another reason I had for coming over.
First I wanted to ask you about going to Knott's Berry Farm and then I wanted to tell you that Ricky spent the night over at our place.
He did?
Yeah.
Why?
Why?
Well, he Why?
Hello?
Yes?
Oh.
Oh, well, thank you.
He's on his way home from the studio.
Yeah, that's it.
He got an early call from the studio, and he didn't want to disturb you.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, I'll see you later.
I just thought of something I have to tell Ethel.
Hi.
Come on, Ethel.
Let's go and eat breakfast.
We just had breakfast.
Well, let's go and have another one.
I'm starving.
What's the matter with you?
Ethel, Ethel, did anyone sleep on your couch last night?
Yeah.
Why?
Are you sure?
Sure, I'm sure.
Well, I'll be darned.
How did you know I slept on the couch last night?
Aha!
"Aha" what?
I sleep on the couch lots of nights.
Fred snores like a buzz saw.
Well, at least you know where your buzz saw was last night.
What are you talking about?
Ricky didn't come home at all.
He didn't!
Oh, now, let's not jump to conclusions.
There must be some logical Oh, you keep out of this, you, you husband, you!
Well, I'm lost.
What are you talking about?
Oh, Fred's trying to cover up for Ricky by telling me that he slept on your couch last night.
Oh, honestly, Fred.
Well, I just thought that there might be a Hi, everybody.
Hi, honey.
Oh!
Have you no shame?
Huh?
Look at him, out all night, parading around at 10:00 in the morning in his tuxedo!
What happened?
You'll never get out of this one.
Just turn around and head back for Cuba.
I'd like to know what's going on.
So would I. Where were you last night?
Yes.
Where were you last night, you cad?
Yeah.
I'd kind of like to know myself.
What's the matter with all of you?
You know where I was last night.
I went to the premiere and then I want to the party at Mocambo's.
And then?
And then?
And then I came home.
Ha!
Now look, I-I-I You mind telling me what-what you're talking about?
I was right on that couch all night and you did not come home.
You crazy or something?
Of course I came home.
I'll tell you exactly what happened.
I came home.
It was 2:30 in the morning.
You were asleep on the couch.
I tried to woke you, wake you up, but you wouldn't budge.
So, I-I figured I'd better let you sleep there, it was late.
So I covered you up, I gave you a kiss.
I went in the bedroom, I went to sleep.
I had an early call this morning and I got up.
I-I-I You were still asleep, so I went to work and I finished my work, I came home.
That's all there is to it.
Oh, come now.
You can do better than that.
She's right.
You can do better than that.
I suppose you always wear your tuxedo in the studio in the morning?
Well, th-they wanted me to wear the tuxedo.
They-they were taking some pictures supposed to be in a nightclub.
Oh, glib, isn't he?
Check with Ross Elliott.
All right, I will.
Oh, oh, wait a minute.
He dropped me here on the way to the airport.
He's on his way to San Francisco right now.
How very convenient.
Now, wait a minute.
Now, th-th-th-this, this is ridiculous.
I'm telling you, I was home last night!
All right.
All right.
If you had to put your tuxedo on again this morning, that means that I'll find the shirt you wore last night in the clothes hamper, right?
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Wait a minute.
I had to wear the same shirt.
All the other tuxedo shirts were in the laundry.
Oh, now, isn't that too bad?
Now, look.
This is ridiculous now.
I'm telling you all that I was home last night.
And you slept in your bed.
Yes.
Then your bed would be unmade.
Yes.
Did you made that bed?
No, I did not "made" that bed.
Has the maid been here?
No, the maid has not been here.
See?
Wastepaper basket's full ashtrays haven't been emptied.
Go ahead.
It's your turn.
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm waiting.
There's something.
There's got to be something.
I know.
I got it!
My carnation-- I threw it in the wastebasket in the bedroom.
Ha!
I know I put it in here!
What happened to it?
The phantom maid strikes again.
Oh, now.
Come on, now.
Look, I'm telling you, I'm telling you that I came home last night.
I came home, it was 2:30 in the morning.
You were asleep in the couch.
I could That's it.
You were asleep in the couch, right?
Yes.
All right.
If I wasn't home, how do I know that you were asleep on the couch?
Yeah.
Because I just told you.
I told you when you came in that I was asleep on that couch all night.
Yeah.
Oh.
Nice try, though.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I thought I could finish up in here.
I mean, I thought I could do the room.
Now, look, honey.
You got to listen to me.
I Finish up in here?
Maid!
Maid?
Maid!
Maid, please come here!
Come here, please.
Come here, please.
Come right in here.
Now, look, you just said you wanted to finish up in here.
Were you here before?
Oh, no.
No, I wasn't in here, sir.
It's against the rules for the maid to enter the room when the guest is in.
Oh, and please don't tell the manager I did!
Oh!
You're wonderful.
I love you dearly.
Oh, oh, gee, I wish all the guests were as nice as this.
Well, I wish all the maids were as nice as you are.
You're a very nice lady, and I'm gonna give you the biggest box of candy you ever got.
I love you.
Ricky, I'm sorry I thought what I thought.
Can you forgive me?
Listen, for a minute, I was beginning to wonder whether I was home last night.
Let's go, Ethel.
The lovebirds are at it again.
Oh, look.
Here's a program from the premiere last night.
Yeah.
Yeah, I brought it home last night so Lucy could see How about that?
What?
My alibi.
Oh, no!
Was it here all the time?
All night long.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Honey, I'm going downstairs to get the New York papers.
Can I get you anything?
Oh, will you mail my postcards for me?
Are you still writing postcards?
You must have written a hundred of those since we got out here.
Well, I want to share our trip with everybody.
We're having so much fun, I want our friends in New York to have sort of a secondhand thrill.
Well, that's nice, dear.
Uh, honey?
Yeah?
Do you feel all right?
Sure.
Why?
Come here.
Let me look at you.
I'm afraid maybe you're getting a cold.
Stick out your tongue.
What's the big idea?
Well, I've stamped so many cards, I'm all out of lick.
Here you are.
Okay.
Now, remember, don't read them.
Why not?
Because it's not nice to read other people's postcards.
Well, you and Ethel do it at home all the time.
Not until after they're mailed.
It's illegal to read them before they're postmarked.
Oh, I see.
All right, I won't read them.
Okay.
The rules you two have.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Lucy.
What?
What do you mean by writing this to Lillian Appleby?
You read them.
Yes, and it's a good thing I did.
What do you mean telling Lillian Appleby that you're going to be in a movie?
I can't get over it.
You stood right here and said you wouldn't read them.
Honestly, you just don't know who you can trust anymore.
For heaven's sake, a man who will read a postcard after he said he won't will do anything.
Never mind all that.
I want to know all about this movie you're gonna be in.
I refuse to discuss anything with a sneak.
A snick?
All right, a snick.
Why did you told Lillian Appleby that you were going to be in a movie?
Because I had to told her.
Or she'd be mad if I told Marian Strong first.
Did you tell all these people that you were going to be in a movie?
No.
I didn't mention it to little Ricky.
Ay-ay-ay.
I don't understand it.
I don't see how you can say something that is not true.
How do you know it isn't true?
It's true until it's untrue.
After all, Hollywood's looking for new faces.
Well, your face is not new.
It is to them.
They've never seen it before.
Well, it finally happened.
Ever since we've been out in Hollywood, I've been waiting for you to try to get into the movies.
What took you so long?
I was lulling you into a false sense of security.
Yeah.
Well, now that you brought the subject up, let me tell you something.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Is this gonna be the one about how I'm a wife and mother and my place is in the home?
No.
Is it about one member of the family in show business being enough?
No.
Oh, well, don't tell me you're gonna use that ridiculous one about my not having any talent.
No.
Oh, you have a new one?
Well, go ahead.
Here you are.
Here you are in pretty, sunny California.
Hundreds of people all over the world would give their right arm just for the opportunity to visit here.
And what do you want to do?
You want to go to a studio and work from morning till night six days a week.
Well, I It's a beautiful climate.
There's hundreds of things to do.
Hundreds of places to go.
You got your best pals, the Mertzes, here with you to go wherever you want to go.
You got a brand-new, beautiful Pontiac to take you there.
This could be one of the most wonderful and exciting experiences of your whole life.
Well, gee, I But what do you want to do?
You want to go to work.
I wished you'd used the one about my not having any talent.
This one's tough to fight.
Why, sure, honey.
Why don't you forget all about being in the movies and have fun, enjoy yourself?
Well Ethel and I did want to go to Catalina next week.
Sure!
And maybe Pismo Beach.
Yes?
And then there's always Palm Springs.
Palm springs!
Even the president vacations there.
That's true.
Hi.
Come in.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey.
Are we gonna have fun?
I was just planning some big trips for us.
I'm afraid they'll have to wait a while.
Yeah.
Why?
Tell them, Ethel.
Well, we were just down in the coffee shop and we ran into a fella who used to be in vaudeville with us, Jimmy O'Connor.
And he's a producer at your studio now, Ricky, and guess what.
What?
He gave us parts in his new picture.
And we start tomorrow.
Isn't that exciting?
!
That's great!
Whee.
What's the matter with you?
I thought you'd be happy for us.
I am.
Well, you don't sound happy.
Now, look, honey, this won't change anything.
The Mertzes would probably only be in the picture a day or two.
Oh, no.
It's for two whole weeks.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
What's the matter with her?
Well, just before you came in, I talked her out of wanting to get into the movies and convinced her that she could have a lot more fun just taking trips with you two.
Oh, dear.
Oh, now, don't you worry.
Lucy, we'll take lots of trips together.
Just as soon as we wrap up our picture commitments.
Oh, sure.
We'll still want to see those places.
Well, we got to go over to wardrobe and get fitted for our costumes.
Hey, listen, I got to go over to the studio, too.
I'll drop you off.
Oh, fine.
Fine.
Aw, honey, don't be blue.
Come on.
See you later, huh?
Well, see you later.
So long, Lucy.
Bye, dear.
Imagine us in the movies.
Yeah.
Come in.
Hi, Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, hello, Bobby.
I brought up your cleaning.
Would you hang it in the bedroom for me, please?
Yes, ma'am.
Enjoying your stay in Hollywood?
Yech.
Hey, you, uh, you got the red eight on the red nine.
Yeah.
I thought it might spice up the game if I cheated a little.
Uh, Mrs. Ricardo, you won't be seeing me for a few days.
Oh, you going on a trip?
No, I got a part in a picture.
You have?
Yeah.
Remember last time I was only a stooge?
Uh-huh.
This time I got a line to read.
A whole line!
Yeah.
Oh, it's a very dramatic scene.
See, I play a hospital orderly.
Now, this woman comes rushing in.
Her hair is messed up 'cause she's very upset 'cause her husband's been in an accident.
Now, she sees me and she says, "What room is my husband in"?
Then I say, "423".
Sort of gets you right here, doesn't it?
Boy, I got more talent than I thought.
No, you don't understand, Bobby.
You see, my husband is starring in a picture, and today my best friends, the Mertzes, told me that they got parts in a picture and now you tell me you got a part.
I just feel left out.
I feel like an ugly duckling.
Well, that's ridiculous!
You're prettier than any of us.
And talented, too!
Oh, can-can you act?
Can I act?
Can I act?
!
What room is my husband in?
Thank you!
See?
Hey, you're great.
Yeah, well, thanks a lot.
I'm afraid my light's always gonna be hidden under a bushel.
What about your husband?
Can he help you get in pictures?
You mean, Ricky Ricardo, the Cuban bushel?
Well, you'll just have to go out and let somebody else discover you.
How?
Oh, a lot of people get discovered.
Why, there was there was Champ Butler.
He was discovered parking cars.
And then there was Dorothy Lamour.
She was discovered running an elevator.
And then there was Lana Turner.
She was discovered at a soda fountain, sitting on a stool.
Well, I don't think I'd be very good at parking cars, and elevators make me dizzy, but I do know how to sit.
Well, great.
Why don't you give it a whirl?
What soda fountain was it?
The one at Schwab's Drugstore up on Sunset Boulevard.
Schwab's?
Schwab's.
Schwab's.
Thanks a lot.
Come in.
Hi.
Oh, hi!
How did everything go?
Oh, Ricky, it was just wonderful.
We got the cutest gay '90s costumes you ever saw.
The funniest thing happened in Wardrobe.
Oh, now, Fred, I didn't think that was very funny.
It was pretty funny.
What happened, Fred?
Well, we had tried on our costumes and were all rest up in our own clothes ready to leave.
Now, Fred.
And the head of Wardrobe accused Ethel of trying to sneak out with one of his bustles.
Oh, that's very funny.
How's Lucy?
I don't know.
She wasn't home when I got here, and I'm beginning to worry about her a little bit, you know.
She was so blue when I left.
Oh, she's probably just gone sightseeing.
Sure.
Oh, here she is.
Oh, here she is.
Hi, Lucy.
Hiya, honey.
Hi.
Where you been?
I was beginning to worry about you.
Well, I've been out not getting in the movies.
What are you talking about?
Well, after you three abandoned me today, I went and sat in Schwab's Drugstore so I could be discovered like Lana Turner.
Oh, no.
Yeah, I sat there all afternoon.
Well, what happened?
You look kind of funny.
Yeah, well, you'd look kind of funny, too, if you'd just had three chocolate malts, two hot fudge sundaes, a pineapple soda and a banana split.
You ate all that?
I had to.
It was the only way I could keep my place at the counter.
They have a rule: "No eat, no seat".
Aw and nobody did any discovering?
Well, only me.
About an hour ago, I discovered I was getting green.
Well, at least she's not blue anymore.
Oh, Fred.
Oh, dear.
Why don't I give up?
The only way I'll ever get in the movies is to buy a ticket.
Oh, now, honey.
I just can't go back to New York and face my friends.
As soon as I get to feeling a little better, I'm gonna kill myself.
Now, look, don't you talk like that.
Listen, if it means that much to you, well, maybe there's something that I can do.
What?
Well, if you just want to say that you were in a picture, maybe I can call one of the directors at Metro-- I got a couple friends in there-- and see if they can give you a little part or something, you know.
Ricky, would you?
Well, I can't promise you anything, but I can try.
Oh, thank you, honey.
I'll call tomorrow morning and see what they say.
Thank you.
Hey, Frank.
Oh, hi, Ricky.
Where's your wife?
Oh, she's just coming out of Wardrobe.
She'll be here in a minute.
She is so excited about doing this part in this picture, you wouldn't believe it, and when she found out that she gets to die in the scene, she almost did.
Oh, well, it really isn't anything.
Well, she thinks she's playing Camille.
She's been practicing how to die all day long.
Oh, here she is.
Come over here, honey.
Come on, I want you to meet your director.
Oh.
Frank, this is my wife, Lucy.
Frank Williams, the director.
How do you do?
How do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?
How do you do?
I'm glad to have you with us.
Well, thank you.
It certainly is nice to be here.
I sure hope I do a good job for you, sir.
Oh, I'm sure you will.
Now, here's what I'd like you to do.
You're the star of this nightclub sequence.
The star?
Now, as our scene opens, you're discovered at the top of the steps with these four girls.
On the cue music, you come about halfway down, a shot rings out, you clutch your heart and you drop.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I'm pretty excited, but I'm sure I can do it.
That's how simple, honey, huh?
Yeah.
You can handle that.
I'm sure I can.
Now, just be calm, and good luck to you.
Okay, dear, bye.
I got a date with Mr. Minnelli, so I got to go.
See you later.
Good-bye, honey.
See you, Frank.
Good-bye.
Don't worry, now.
You'll be all right.
Uh, Nick Nick, would you get that headdress on her, please?
Oh, boys, no!
That spot-- no.
I don't want that there.
Here you are, Mrs. Ricardo.
Is that for me?
Uh-huh.
I'm afraid it's kind of heavy.
Oh, well, that's all right.
I'll be able to manage it.
Can I let go now?
Yeah, that's all right.
Thank you.
Well, just a minute.
Just a minute.
Oh, dear.
Yeah, well.
There.
All right now?
There we are.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Have you ever worn one of these before?
Well, no, sir, but I-I'm sure that I can handle it.
It's quite a trick.
It's just getting used to balancing it.
How's that?
Just getting used to balancing it.
Oh, yes, I'll be able to!
Thanks.
All right.
All right, places, girls!
Get into positions!
Line up at the top of the steps, please.
Mrs. Ricardo, would you like What?
Take your position at the top of the steps, please, Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh yes, sir!
Thank you.
Don't go up too far.
That's it.
Now, Would you mind turning around, please, coming towards the center?
A little more to your A little more to your left, please.
Your left.
Your left, Mrs. Ricardo.
That's it.
Thank you very much.
Now, would you tilt your head a little bit?
How's that?
Tilt your head a little bit, please.
That's fine, that's fine.
Yes, that way.
Now, would you drop your arms very grace gracefully.
That's it.
Kind of put your foot out a little bit, like on your toe Fine.
Do you feel comfortable?
No, sir-- yes, sir.
That's it.
Now smile, everybody.
All right.
Hit the music, Harry.
Mrs. Ricardo, what seems to be the trouble?
Well, sir, the headdress was just a little heavy and it sort of tilted forward.
I'm-I'm sorry, sir.
I'll be able to manage it.
Well, I-I don't want you to be uncomfortable.
Perhaps I'd better give it to a bigger girl.
Oh, no, sir.
I'm big enough.
Thank you.
I can do it.
All right, all right, let's try it once again.
Now let's rehearse it this time.
All right, fine.
Now, that's it.
Now, same positions now.
Remember, smile.
The hands see?
That's right.
Tilt the head a little bit, girls.
Lots of life.
All right, music.
It's all right.
Mrs. Ricardo!
Now, what seems to be the problem?
Well, my train is caught, sir.
It's a nail.
I'll get it.
Yes, sir.
There, that's clear.
All right.
Okay.
Here we are.
You know, I I'm afraid perhaps this headdress is a little too much for you.
Oh, no, sir, no, sir.
Now, Mr. Williams, my train just got caught.
That could happen to anyone, sir.
Well, I-I'd feel much better if it was handled by a girl who could really handle it.
Oh, I can, I can handle it, sir.
I'm sure I can.
Annette, would you kindly switch headdresses, please?
Oh, no, sir, Mr. Williams!
Mr. Williams!
Yes?
Isn't the girl who wears that the one who gets killed?
Yes, that's right.
Would you put this on, please?
Well, I I don't really think that that's very fair, Mr. Williams.
I I didn't really get a chance, you know.
Mr. Williams All right, all right, now, look, now you take Mrs. Ricardo's place in the center.
You'll be the lead girl now.
Thank you.
Mrs. Ricardo, would you mind standing over there by the rail?
Thank you very much.
You're doing very well.
Very well, very well.
Now let's have a nice walk- through this time, girls.
No stops, like go all the way through, right up by the rail, please.
Thank you.
I'd like to try another run-through now, only this time I'd like you to come down the stairs a little faster.
Music.
Ah!
Mrs. Ricardo, just what do you think you're doing?
Well, you said you wanted us to come down a little faster.
I'm sorry I tripped on my train.
It was sort of a train trip.
You like to try it once more, please?
Mr. Williams, are you sure you don't want me to be the girl who gets killed?
Please, Mrs. Ricardo.
Wouldn't you like to see me die?
Don't tempt me.
Well, I-I certainly wish I could be the girl who dies, Mr. Williams, because it means so much to me, you know.
I Mrs. Ricardo I have rehearsed it a lot.
I know what Mrs. Ricardo I'm sure that if you could see me do it, Mrs. Ricardo you'd appreciate that I'd probably do it better than any of the girls.
Would you please let me get a word in edgewise?
Yes, sir.
I just felt that you should know how I feel about it, you know.
Yes, I certainly do.
Mrs. Ricardo, would you please get up to the top of the stairs there?
We'll try it once more.
Just once more, please.
I'd like to rehearse it.
Please.
Thank you very much.
You're doing very, very well.
Doing beautifully.
Yes.
Uh, could we hurry it a little?
You see, we're a little behind on schedule.
Thank you very much.
All right.
Are we all set now?
All right, remember, girls, now, smile.
Smile pretty.
That's it.
Music.
Mrs. Ricardo, just just what do you think you're doing?
That shot was supposed to be for the other girl.
Well, he missed.
Look, Mrs. Ricardo, you just don't seem to understand.
You see, I-I-I'm the director on this picture.
Yes, sir, I know that.
See, I make all the decisions.
I say what happens on this set.
I understand that, sir.
You understand that.
You know, one more thing like this, and you won't be in this picture at all.
Oh, well, look, Mr. Williams, I-I just feel that I just have to be the girl who dies.
You see, you don't understand.
I-I couldn't go back to New York and face my friends.
I've told them that I'm going to be in a picture, and I, and I can't just let it be walk-on-and-off, you know.
This is my big chance.
Yeah, so I understand.
Yeah, well, you see, all right, Mrs. Ricardo.
I've told them for months and months and months, you know, and I Yes, Mrs. Ricardo and then when I got this, I figured it was going to be a really big thing, you know.
I really understand-- believe me, I feel for you-- but you've got to understand my situation, too.
Well, you know how friends back home are, you know.
Yes.
Oh, yes, I know how friends are, but, you see, I have a problem, too.
I know, but the problem is I'd like to get this picture done before the end of this year.
I understand that.
Thank you.
I understand that.
So, you can be the girl who dies.
Oh!
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you.
I'd like that headdress, please.
Oh, hold it!
No, no, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I-I-I've got an entirely new concept for this scene.
Much more dramatic.
Oh?
Yes.
You are going to be discovered dead as the scene opens.
I'm already dead?
Already dead.
Oh, uh, but Oh, no, no, no, no-- no buts.
You just lie down here, Mrs. Ricardo.
Just lie down.
Thank you very much.
Just lie down.
Uh face down.
Face down?
!
Face down.
But Mr. Williams, I've seen lots of pictures, and when people die, they don't usually die face down.
They die face up into the camera.
Okay, okay, we'll do it another way.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.
Uh, boys, will you bring in the stretcher, please?
This will work very, very well.
It's very dramatic, too.
Would you lie down on the stretcher, please?
Thank you very much.
Face up?
Face up.
Yes, sir.
All set?
All set.
There we are.
All right, now, girls, as we start this scene now Mr. Williams how will my friends know it's me?
Your feet will be showing.
Oh, swell.
All right, now, boys, will you change the setup now?
I'll be right back.
And, girls, I'd like Where are you going now?
I'm going to powder my feet.
All right, girls, will you gather round here, please?
In this setup here Hi!
Oh, hi, Ricky.
How's Lucy?
Oh, she's fine.
I'm a nervous wreck.
What happened?
Something went wrong?
Oh, no, no, no, everything's fine.
Oh, good.
Okay, sir, we're ready to go.
Are the attendants ready?
Yes, sir.
All right, well, where's the dead woman?
Here I am.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo.
Fine.
Would you excuse me a moment, Ricky?
Sure.
We'll get on with this scene.
Will you just lie down here, please?
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Pick up the sheet, please.
Yes.
I'll just put your dress up here nicely.
There we are.
All right, there.
Could you cover her?
Oh, that's beautiful.
Now, remember, this is a very dramatic scene.
You're very sad.
You're very upset.
Lots of emotion.
Let's get this scene done this time.
Not a word from anyone.
Ready?
Roll 'em.
Action!
Cut!
Print it!
Thanks!
That's beautiful!
All right, boys, you can take it away now.
Oh, girls, that was just wonderful.
Just wonderful.
Just wonderful.
Lucy, what happened?
Nothing.
Well, that's not the way that they explained the scene to me, nobody will know who you are.
Oh, well, I'm not too unhappy.
That's show business, you know, darling.
I'm sorry, Ricky, but Well, that's all right.
At least you got in the picture.
That's right.
Sure.
Excuse me, sir, but, uh What?
Mrs. Ricardo Yeah, well, let's go, Ricky.
May I see your feet, please?
Certainly.
You know what I mean.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Well?
Well?
Do you see anything different about me?
No.
Two legs, two arms, one head.
Oh, you know, what I mean.
Did I get any suntan?
No.
Oh, darn it.
Honey, why don't you give up trying to get a suntan?
You always get burned with your fur skin.
Well my "fur skin"?
Hi, fellas.
Hi.
Hi.
Say, we're gonna drive up to Pomona tomorrow afternoon, Lucy.
We thought maybe you'd like to go with us.
Okay.
What's the matter with her?
Oh, she's upset because she can't get a suntan.
Oh, what's the difference?
There's a lot of difference out here.
Oh, I'll say there is.
We went down to Beverly Hills yesterday, and those women all had the most beautiful tans.
It was embarrassing.
Ethel and I looked like a couple of marshmallows.
Sure did.
Gee, I'd love to get a tan.
You know what I'd like to look like?
A toasted marshmallow.
No.
I'd like to look like I belong in Beverly Hills.
Oh even if you've got a tan, it wouldn't help.
Did you notice the beautiful clothes those women were wearing?
Yeah, you're right.
I'd just look like a tacky toasted marshmallow unless, of course, I could buy some beautiful clothes like those women were wearing.
I would dearly love to have just one dress from an exclusive salon like Don Loper's.
Oh, yes, it would just set you up for life if you could open your closet door and see one Loper label.
Yeah, what's the sense of dreaming?
Well, now, wait a minute, honeybunch.
Maybe we can figure something out.
Who said that?
It sounded like Fred, but I don't believe it!
Fred, you really mean it?
Sure.
Oh What do you think he'd charge for one label?
Oh, fine.
Ricky Ricky, you're not going to say no, are you?
Look, all I want is just one simple, little, ordinary, plain dress from Loper's.
I'll buy the cheapest one he has.
Honest, I will.
Honest, I will.
Well, it's a thought.
If you It is?
Yeah.
Oh!
Honey, oh!
Oh, you agreed so fast, my brain blew a fuse!
Oh!
Wait a minute.
I just said it was a thought.
Yeah, I know, honey, I know.
Well, h-how much is a dress at Loper's?
Well, it wouldn't be very much.
How much?
Well, not very much, really, for what you'd be getting.
Well, how much?
Practically nothing.
Could you break that "nothing" into dollars?
Well, uh, just for one simple, ordinary, plain, little old nothing dress $100?
: $100 for one dress?
The reason he almost choked to death is because $100 is all I've spent on clothes ever since we've been married.
Ah-ha, that's very good, Ethel, very good.
Well, see you later.
Hup-bup-bup- bup-bup-bup.
You didn't answer my question.
Well, uh, I thought it over very carefully, and I, uh, I have given due consideration to the fact that this might be the only time that we're out here in Hollywood.
That's right.
But the only answer I can arrive at is yes.
Oh, honey!
Thank you!
Only one.
That's all I want!
That's all I want!
Boy, fancy-schmancy.
Ethel!
What?
Why do you have to act like a rube?
Because I am a rube, and so are you.
I know it, but let's try to act at home here at Don Loper's.
Well, it's kind of difficult when your permanent address has always been Gimbels' basement.
Hey, where are all the racks of dresses?
There aren't any.
What do you paw through?
You don't "paw" through anything.
Get your mind out of that basement.
They bring the dresses in one at a time.
How do you know?
I've heard.
What are we whispering for?
I don't know.
This is just a place you automatically whisper in.
Come on, sit down and shut up.
Good morning, ladies.
Good morning.
Oh, how do you do?
May I be of assistance?
Yes.
I'd like to see a dress, please, size 12.
Certainly.
Oh, and, uh  An original.
Gee, wait till the girls back home find out I bought a dress from here.
Oh, Jane Sebastian will be absolutely green.
Of course, she'll pretend she doesn't notice it.
Listen, she'll notice this Don Loper label if I have to wear the dress wrong-side-out.
You would, too.
This creation is one of Mr. Loper's newest.
Notice the dropped waistline and the simple neck that's designed to be worn with dozens of strands of beads.
Oh, yes.
I could wear that with my uh Oh, yes, it's lovely.
Yes, it's, it's not quite what I had in mind, though.
Close, but not quite.
Uh, could I see something else, please?
Why, certainly.
You didn't ask her the price.
Ethel, you don't ask the price in a place like this.
You don't?
Of course not.
You wait till they turn their back and you sneak a look at the price tag.
What's the matter?
I got my ring caught on something.
Here's something you might like.
I think this is one of the smartest dresses in the whole collection.
Oh, it's lovely, isn't it, Ethel?
Oh, yes, it's very nice.
It's imported material, of course.
Of course.
Just feel.
Uh Oh, yes, that is a nice piece of goods.
If you'd like to try it on, you can step right into the dressing room.
Uh, no, no, I'd rather not try any on just yet.
I I'd like to see a few more first.
Why, certainly.
Oh, let me take that out of your way.
Uh, no, no.
I'm still considering this one, if you don't mind.
Very well.
Thank you.
Help me.
What's it caught on?
The price tag.
There it is.
$500!
It can't be!
But it is.
Well, back to Gimbels' basement.
No, no.
This is my only chance to get a Don Loper original.
It's your chance to get a black eye from Ricky, too.
They can't all be this expensive.
This is probably high-priced because it's so fancy.
I'll ask her for something plainer and simpler.
Oh, I think you're just asking for trouble.
Well, let me worry about that, will you?
Here's something you might like.
This color would be stunning with your hair.
: Oh, really?
Uh, it's, it's very nice.
Um, but, you know, I've been thinking.
I think I'd like to see something simpler and plainer.
And cheaper.
She means "deeper"-- deeper in the neckline.
Deeper than this?
Oh, well, I, I, I Could I see something else?
Certainly.
Hello, Amzie.
Mrs. MacRae.
Is Mr. Loper in?
Certainly.
I'll tell him you're here.
Thank you.
We're gonna get to see Don Loper.
Not only that, but do you know who that is?
No.
Who?
Gordon MacRae's wife.
Oh, of course it is.
I've seen dozens of pictures of her.
Yeah.
She was an actress and she gave up her career to have a family.
That's right, just like me.
Good morning, Sheila.
Hello, Don.
How are you?
Very well, darling.
You're looking enormously pretty today.
Thank you.
How's our fashion show coming along?
Oh, Don, it's wonderful.
You know, I think it's going to be the best fashion show we've ever have.
Well, I hope so, because we've put an enormous amount of effort behind it.
You know, I'd like to check some of the last-minute details with you.
All right.
Now, has everybody been in for a fitting?
I don't really know, darling.
Let me go and see the list and I'll check with you.
You know what they're talking about?
No.
What?
I read about it in the paper.
They're having a fashion show here, and the proceeds go to a charity called SHARE, Incorporated, and it's made up of movie stars' wives, and the movie stars' wives are going to be wearing the clothes.
No kidding.
Yeah.
Now I have it here.
Well, it turns out that Mrs. Dean Martin's been in.
Mrs. Dean Martin.
Mrs. Forrest Tucker Mrs. Van Heflin Mrs. William Holden  Mrs. Richard Carlson Everybody but Mrs. Joel McCrea.
: I forgot!
Frances can't come; she's leaving for Europe.
She phoned me.
Well, This is a fine time to tell me, darling.
The show is tomorrow.
Oh, Don, who are we gonna get to take her place?
It has to be the wife of a star, the publicity's out.
Yeah, I don't even know who's left in town.
Uh, pardon me.
Could I use your phone, please?
Oh, please make my phone yours.
: Oh.
Hello.
Is this MGM?
I'd like to speak to Mr. Ricky Ricardo, please, the star of Don Juan?
Yes, this is Mrs. Ricardo, the star's wife.
Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, wife of the movie star Ricky Ricardo.
Yes.
Oh?
Oh, he isn't there.
Oh, would you give him a message, please?
Would you be so kind as to tell him that I've been detained at the Don Loper Salon?
: Thank you very much.
Well, that was a subtle performance.
Shut up.
This is about the simplest dress I could find.
We call it "Loper's basic dress".
You can accessorize it beautifully.
Well, accessorization is what she's really looking for.
I couldn't help overhearing your telephone conversation.
Oh?
You are Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, aren't you?
Oh, yes.
Well, I'm Sheila MacRae.
Oh, how do you do?
How do you do?
Uh, Mrs. Gordon MacRae, Mrs. Fred Mertz.
How do you do?
How do you do?
We've been reading a lot about your husband lately.
Oh.
Yes, he has been getting quite a bit of publicity, hasn't he?
You know, I know this is awfully short notice, but we're having a fashion show for charity, Oh.
and the wives of the stars are going to model the gowns.
Oh, how nice.
And one of the girls dropped out I'd love to.
I beg your pardon?
Weren't you going to ask me to be in it?
Oh, yes, I was.
I'd love to.
Good.
Uh, which one of these did you buy?
Uh that one.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Don!
Yes, Sheila?
How can I be of service?
Mrs. Ricardo, this is Mr. Don Loper.
How do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?
Hi.
Welcome to my house.
Oh, well, thank you.
I'd have been here sooner, but I'm from the East-- New York City-- Upper.
Oh!
Well, I'm so pleased to see that you're in Hollywood.
You make our city so much prettier.
: Oh!
Uh, oh, Mr. Loper, this is Mrs. Fred Mertz.
How do you do, Mrs. Mertz?
: Oh, Mr. Loper What's our problem, Sheila?
Don, Mrs. Ricardo has consented to help us out tomorrow in the fashion show.
Wonderful, Mrs. Ricardo.
I've very flattered.
Well, I'd certainly be delighted.
And she's going to wear this.
And I'll tell you what, Amzie, take Mrs. Ricardo to the fitting room and have it fitted immediately, and we'll give it to you at noon.
Oh, wonderful!
Right this way.
Oh, yes, yes.
Pardon me.
Certainly.
Thank you.
I'm delighted that you're going to be with us.
I'm delighted that I'm Thank you.
Oh, honestly Well, at least I've got a Don Loper dress.
Yes, with a Don Loper label and a mystery price tag.
Oh, Ethel, don't try to spoil things.
Well, I can't help it.
It's just fantastic to me that you would buy a dress and walk out of the store and not know what it cost.
Well, I was trapped.
they shoved me into a fitting room, they stuck some pins in me and they grabbed the dress and I didn't get a chance to look at the price tag.
Why would you buy any dress without looking at the price tag?
Because I wanted to be in the fashion show.
I had to buy the dress.
Well, why did you have to be in a fashion show?
What is this, 20 questions?
For heaven's sake, Ethel, a little plain dress like this couldn't cost more than $100.
Well, it'd better not cost more than $100 'cause that's all Ricky said you could spend, and if it's more than that, I'd hate to be around when he Oh!
It can't be.
But it is.
Doesn't Loper know any other numbers but 5-0-0?
Oh, this is even worse than I thought.
A plain, simple, little dress like this for $500?
I don't believe it.
How are you gonna explain the extra cost to Ricky?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, you can't take it back.
It's been altered.
Yeah, when Ricky finds out about it, I'll be altered.
Well, there's just one thing to do.
What?
Aren't you going to stop me?
Why?
I can't think of a better way out.
Well, it isn't high enough anyway.
Oh, dear.
Look, Ricky was gonna let me spend And I'm gonna do the fashion show, so the publicity should be worth the extra 400.
Oh, for heaven's sake, what am I gonna do?
How am I gonna get out of this?
Oh, that shouldn't be difficult for an old escape artist like you.
Yeah.
Yeah, I got to think.
I can't think of a thing.
Oh, sure you can.
No, I can't.
Something's happened to my my brain.
It's all dried up.
Maybe you stayed out in that sun too long this morning.
Oh, please, Ethel.
Just help That's it.
Ethel, that's the best idea you ever had.
Thanks.
What is it?
The sun!
You know how easily I burn.
Yes.
Well, I'm going down by the pool and stay there until I get red.
Not really burn, but just red enough so that I can pretend I'm in terrible pain.
Ricky wouldn't dare hit me in that condition.
Hey, that is a good idea I had.
I'd better get out there.
There isn't much sun today.
I thought you were gonna go to Pomona with us.
Oh, you go.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Honey, I'm home.
Ricky?
Yeah?
Ricky, I've been waiting for you to come home.
I want you to help me.
Maybe you could talk some sense into Fred.
What's the matter with him?
Oh, he wants to sell our apartment house in New York and buy an orange grove out by Pomona.
So, what's the matter with that?
You don't know anything about raising oranges.
That's what's the matter with that.
So what?
The oranges know what to do.
I think you'd better think about it twice.
Where's Lucy?
Lucy?
Yes?
Honey!
Honey, what happened?
Oh I guess it wasn't as overcast as I thought.
Oh, you poor little thing.
Hey, that gives me an idea.
If the orange crop fails, I can raise tomatoes.
Honey, how did you get so?
Don't touch me.
Oh, sweet Sit down, baby.
Oh, no, I can't sit down!
The back of my leg is so burned, I can't bend my knees.
Oh, mi.
Well, h-how-how did it happen, honey?
Did-did-did-did you, uh, fall asleep in the sun?
You feel sorry for me, don't you, dear?
Of course I do, sweetheart.
Well, I'll tell you how it happened.
I went to Don Loper's this morning and I bought a dress.
Oh, you bought a dress.
Yeah, and it cost $500 and $500?
!
Yes, $500!
$500 for one dress?
!
Yes!
Yes.
Well, Ricky, I can explain.
You cannot explain $500 for one dress.
Take it back.
Well, that-that-that isn't as easy as it sounds.
Why?
Don't tell me it was on sale.
No, but, uh well, then take it back.
But, uh But no buts.
No but, no-no bu-bu-bu-bu-buts.
I don't want any arguments about it.
You got to take the dress back.
Mira que tiene quinientos pesos por un vestido!
Piensa que soy millionario, quinientos pesos por un vestido.
Que te pasa-- esta loca en la cabeza?
And I don't want to hear one more word about it.
I wasn't gonna say anything.
Yeah, but you were thinking about saying something.
$500!
Ay-ay-ay!
Hello?
Hello.
May I speak with Mrs. Ricardo?
This is Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, this is Don Loper.
Oh.
Yes?
I've made a terrible mistake.
The dress you chose to wear in the fashion show is exactly like the one I made for Mrs. Alan Ladd.
And now she's decided that she wants to wear her own dress in the show.
Oh, well, that's all right, really, because You're a living doll.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do, though.
I've just designed a marvelous tweed suit.
And it'll look wonderful on you.
And if you'll wear that in the show, I'll give you the dress you took home.
Give?
!
That's right.
For nothing?
Free.
F-r-e-e-e?
Exactly.
Oh.
Oh, that's just wonderful.
I'll see you at the fashion show.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Ethel, that was Don Loper.
And he says if I wear something else in the fashion show, he'll give me my dress for nothing.
You can't be in a fashion show in that condition.
Oh, yes, I can.
What are you gonna wear-- a coat of unguentine?
Oh, Ethel, I just gotta, I just gotta, and then, and then, and then when I come home, I can tell old grumpy in there to relax and it didn't cost him a cent.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm indeed privileged and flattered that I was invited by SHARE, Incorporated to show you my new collection of clothes called Facade and the clothes will be worn by the wives of some of our top stars in Hollywood.
May I present for your approval first the lovely Mrs. William Holden.
Mrs. Holden is wearing Heathcliff, a street suit of beige combed cashmere wool.
The jacket is semi-fitted and a hip length and is lined in brown silk with a taffeta to match the blouse.
Thank you, dear.
Next is a very, very pretty Mrs. Dean Martin.
Mrs. Martin is wearing a dancing costume called Baldini.
It's in reembroidered lace and the coat is of Italian satin.
Next is a very glamorous Mrs. Van Heflin.
Mrs. Heflin is wearing another dancing costume called Pama.
This is in reembroidered lace with sequins and the coat is of violet satin and it is lined in colors of fuchsia and purple.
Next is a very pretty Mrs. Forrest Tucker.
Mrs. Tucker is wearing a ball gown called Sonata.
This is a new color I created this season called pink mink.
It's in chantilly lace all reembroidered in sequins.
And now the very lovely Mrs. Richard Carlson.
Mrs. Carlson is wearing another ball dress.
This is called Royal Scandal, and it's in Kelly Green, French porte de soie with a back torso of pink roses.
And now we have somebody very new to Hollywood.
We're all delighted to have her.
And may I present this time the lovely Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Mrs. Ricardo is wearing French Dandy, a new suit of imported Irish tweed.
It has the new three-quarter length jacket fitted at the waist with a peplum and you can see a very narrow skirt.
Pardon me, Mrs. Ricardo.
Excuse me.
The collar is worn more this way, you see?
You get that look to it.
That looks better with that.
Thank you very much.
I did it, Ethel.
The dress is mine.
Oh, honey, you were just great.
I was so proud of you.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, gee, Ethel, look at it!
Isn't it beautiful?
Oh, gosh.
I'm gonna leave it right here.
When Ricky comes home, I'm gonna say You know, he'll just blow his top, and I'll say, "Relax dear.
It didn't cost you a cent".
Oh, boy, you'd better say that fast.
Hey, there's a note for you.
Oh, that's from Ricky.
"Lucy dearest, after you left to take your dress back "I got to thinking how mean I acted "when you were feeling so terrible.
So here's a check".
Oh!
"Go buy the dress back.
Love, Ricky".
Aw $500!
Oh, that Cuban dreamboat.
Of course you're going to give the check back to him.
What?
And deprive him of the pleasure of making up?
Oh, I wouldn't be that cruel.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Operator, are you sure you're calling the right number in New York City?
Murray Hill 5-9-0-9-9.
Well, I don't understand it.
They should answer.
Ay, mira que tienen cosas los periodicos estos aqui.
What's the matter, dear?
La senora esta, la senora Hedda Hooper-- nunca me pone el nombre a mi en el periodico.
Nunca la senora Hedda Hooper me pone el nombre en el periodico a mi.
Look, Ricky, I lied to you before we were married.
I really don't understand Spanish.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Now, what's the matter with Hedda Hooper?
We've been here five whole weeks, and she hasn't had my name in the paper once.
And neither has Louella Parsons.
All they talk about is Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn Monroe.
What has Marilyn Monroe got that I haven't got?
Well, I'm sorry, dear.
But you'll get your own publicity in due time.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna get my own publicity agent.
That's what I'm gonna do.
That's a good idea.
Yeah.
Yes?
Oh.
Well, thank you very much, operator.
They don't answer.
I wonder where Mother and Little Ricky are.
I've been calling the apartment all morning.
Well, maybe they went to the park.
Well, they wouldn't stay in the park this long.
You don't think something could have happened.
Oh, I don't know.
Your mother in the park with all those squirrels running around Oh stop it.
Hey, maybe they're on their way out here.
In her last letter, she said they were getting ready.
Oh, don't you think she would have let us know?
You take that back.
What?
What you were thinking when you said, "Yeah".
Anyway, Mother wouldn't forget to send a wire.
No.
Let's just hope that she doesn't forget to bring the baby with her.
Oh, honey.
Morning.
Hi.
Come in.
Oh, hi.
Oh, I don't care.
I know one thing.
If we don't hear soon, I'm gonna call Mrs. Trumball.
What's the matter, honey?
I've been calling New York all morning.
There's no answer in the apartment.
Well, maybe your mother took the baby to the park.
They wouldn't stay in the park for four hours.
Oh, you're just worrying 'cause you're so far away.
Well, it's cold back there now, you know.
It's the middle of winter, you don't stay in the park Oh, hi, Bobby.
Hi.
Telegram for me?
Well, I don't know whether it's for you or not.
We've been trying to figure it out down at the desk.
Now, it's either for you or we'll have to forward it to Japan.
Why?
Who is it addressed to?
Mrs. Mickey Mikado.
It's from your mother.
What's it say?
"Arriving 9:30 with little Ricky.
Love, mother".
He's little Ricky, and I'm big Mickey.
Well, at least, she sent us a wire, told us she's arriving at 9:30.
Hurray for Mother.
A.M. Or P.M.?
She doesn't say.
What day?
She doesn't say.
What airline?
She doesn't say.
Whatever happened to that woman's brain?
She doesn't say.
Come on, give it to me.
Maybe I can figure it out.
They sent the wire last night, so they must be arriving at 9:30 this morning.
I'll call the airport.
National Airport, please.
Gee, maybe they're waiting for us out there right now.
Uh, flight information.
Oh, why didn't they deliver that telegram sooner?
Just be thankful you didn't have to wait till it came back from Japan marked "not known at this pagoda".
Oh, Fred.
Hello?
Will you please tell me if any of the airlines have a flight due in at 9:30 this morning?
Well, how about 9:30 tonight?
No, huh?
Well, thank you very Wait a minute.
Maybe there's a flight number 930.
Hold it.
Okay.
Uh, any of the airlines have a flight number 930?
Yes?
What time is it due in?
Good!
From Bombay?
Bombay?
Well, with your mother, it No, no, even she wouldn't go from New York to Los Angeles by way of India.
Thank you very much.
Don't say it.
You're right, but don't say it.
What are you going to do now, Rick?
Well, we'll just have to stay here and wait for her to find us.
Oh, honey, she might never find us.
Yeah.
She's got the baby with her.
I'll get it, honey.
Thanks.
I'm telling you.
Hello?
This is Lucy.
Oh, it's Mother.
Mother!
Mother!
Mother, where are you?
She's here.
Good.
How's the baby?
Did he, did he, did he like the plane ride?
Oh.
Oh, well, Mom, I'm awful sorry we didn't meet you, But we didn't understand your wire.
Tell her to stay right there.
We'll come and get her.
Yeah, Mom, listen, you-you stay right where you are.
We'll come and get you.
No, now, Mother, please do just as I say.
Stay where you are.
We'll come and get you as soon as we can.
Okay, dear.
Bye.
Come on.
Let's all go out to the airport and get them.
Yeah, come on.
I don't want your mother running around loose too long.
Come on, let's go.
Here we go.
Well, I still say we should have waited out at the airport.
I'm sure mother was out there somewhere.
Well, honey, we were there a whole hour.
Yeah, and we looked everyplace but in the wind sock.
Oh, Fred, don't make jokes.
I'm serious.
I'm worried sick.
Well, what are we gonna do, Rick?
I don't know, Fred.
I'm whipped.
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Keep your voices down.
Mother!
Hey!
For heaven's sake.
How are you, dear?
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Well, long time, no see, Mickey.
Honey what are you, what are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
Why, you asked me to come out to California.
Oh Where's the baby?
I just put him down, but he's got to sleep, dear.
Oh, honey, we told you to stay there.
What happened?
Oh, well, I got so terribly bored just sitting there.
Well, look, Mrs. McGillicuddy, why didn't you stay where you were?
I mean, we've been looking all over the airport.
Uh, what for?
For you.
Well, now, Mickey, that wasn't very bright.
I wasn't at the airport.
Well, where were you when you called?
Down in the lobby.
Down in the lobby?
!
Why don't you say Why didn't you tell Lucy?
She didn't ask me.
Oh, no!
Ay-ay-ay.
Well, am I glad to see you.
Oh!
Ricky!
Come here, honey.
Give him to me.
Hello, sweetheart.
We had a wonderful time, didn't we?
Look how big he's grown.
You bet he's grown.
Come on, let me have him.
You want him?
There you go.
Oh, doesn't he look wonderful, honey?
Wonderful.
Mother, what time did your plane get in?
When was it due in?
Well, yeah, we got your wire, but it said 9:30.
Well?
Well?
Please.
Um, uh, Mother, why did you tell us if they told you 12:30?
Well, I thought everybody knew that there were three hours' difference in time between here and New York.
Oh, that does it, brother.
Now I've heard everything.
Don't you let him talk like that about me.
Ricky, now, look, Mother is right.
There is three hours' difference in time.
Yeah!
Uh Come here, darling.
We'll have our nap.
I know you're tired.
We'll show you California when you get up.
See you later.
I'll see you later, son.
Bye, honey.
You're such a good boy.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
Look, Mrs. Mcgillicuddy.
I would like to explain something to you.
In the first place, they meant Pacific Coast time.
And in the second place, if you wanted to allow for the time, you should have added three hours.
You did the whole thing backwards.
You should have said, "Arriving at Oh, poo!
Now, look, I'm just trying to explain to you.
Well, you should have said I can't hear a word you're saying.
You see, it's only quarter past 3:00.
So, according to you, I'm not even here yet.
Ha!
Now, how do you like that?
I'm only trying to get her straightened out and all I get is "poo"!
and "ha"!
Now just a minute, Ricky.
I think she's right about the time.
Ethel, Ricky is right.
Ethel, how could she be right?
I'm telling you, If it's 3:30 there If you come from New York Well, what do you call gain or lose?
You listen to me.
Look.
The sun opens in the east, and it closes in the west.
Oh  There's the Brown Derby right there, see?
And right over in there is the Hollywood Bowl.
Oh, oh, isn't this exciting?
And Mother, this afternoon, we're gonna take you all around and you will just be amazed.
Every time you walk down the street, you see movie stars walking right along.
Really?
Oh, I hope I see some of my favorites.
Have you seen Ramon Novarro or Francis X. Bushman?
Well, no, I don't think I've seen them.
Oh, and I must see the house where Rudolph Valentino lived.
Oh, I'll never forget him in The Sheik.
I'm the Sheik of Araby Your love belongs to me Yeah, well, that's very nice, Mother.
You know, they're grooming Ricky to be another Rudolph Valentino.
Ricky?
Ricky who?
Ricky me.
That's who.
You?
Oh, dear.
Why, you're not fit to touch the hem of his bernouse.
What did she say?
What did she say?
Que quiere decir bernouse?
Now, look, cut it out, you two.
We're all here in California together.
Now, let's be friends.
Well, all right.
I'm sorry, Mother.
Oh, that's all right, Mickey.
Uh, Mother, you haven't told us a thing about your trip.
Who did you meet on the plane?
Anyone interesting?
Oh, oh, yes, I met some lovely people.
The lady next to me was just as sweet as she could be.
Her daughter wants to get into the movies.
I told her to call you at the studio, Mickey.
Oh, you did, eh?
And the man across the way, he owns an amusement park in Red Bluff, California, and, oh, if we ever get up there, little Ricky can ride the merry-go-round free.
Oh, well, that's nice.
And the woman behind me was, uh, oh, some kind of a newspaperwoman.
Uh, she said she might like to do a story on you.
I invited her over to tea tomorrow afternoon.
Now, look, Mrs. McGillicuddy, I wish that Mother, if you're going sightseeing, you'd better get your coat on, dear.
All right.
I'm the Sheik of Araby  Please, honey.
Why do you have to get so mad?
Oh I'll get it.
Hello?
Oh, come right up, Mr. Pomerantz.
Yes.
Who's that?
My new press agent.
Well, honey, do you have to see him now?
Yeah, honey, this is business.
I got to see him now.
You go take your Mother out.
Oh, honey Okay, I'm ready.
Oh, Mother, you go over and pick up the baby at the Mertzes'.
I'll be with you in about five minutes.
Oh, all right, dear.
Good-bye, Mickey.
Good-bye, Mother.
Hi, Ricky.
I'm Charlie Pomerantz.
Oh, hello, hello.
Come in, Mr. Pomerantz.
Oh, now, Ricky, just call me Charlie.
Okay, Charlie.
Now, then, you're looking for someone to give you a real good publicity buildup, right?
Well, I need something, boy.
I don't seem to get a thing in the motion picture columnist.
Is that accent real?
What accent?
Good.
Good.
Let me take a look at you.
Yeah, handsome, good build.
Hey, you know, Ricky, with your looks and talent and my know-how, we're going places.
We are?
Dad, I'm going to make you the Cuban Liberace.
Well, I don't know about that, but, uh I'd like to see my name in a few of the columns.
Well, let's see, you're doing the lead in Don Juan.
The studio plans to make you the great lover type, huh?
Well, I guess that's right.
Yeah, well, that's always a good angle.
We'll start off by linking your name with glamour girls.
You'll be seen at restaurants and nightclubs, holding hands, dancing, dancing cheek to cheek.
Hold it.
I am married.
Married?
!
Yeah.
Oh, what did you go and do that for?
Well, I'm sorry, but I've been happily married for 14 years.
Say that might be an angle in itself.
No, who would believe it?
No, we got to find something for you, Rick.
Something good.
Well, Charlie, you're the publicity agent.
You're supposed to dream it up.
Hey, hey, wait, wait a minute.
That pool gives me an idea.
Can you swim?
Now, wait just a minute.
I don't want to dive off that balcony.
This is the third floor.
No, no, no, no.
Listen, this is the bit.
Tomorrow afternoon, the Motion Picture Mothers Club is having their annual tea here at the hotel.
Now Hedda Hopper always covers it.
She's always here.
Well?
They're having it on the terrace down by the pool.
Now, suppose I arrange for you to sing at that tea.
Yeah?
And suppose one of the guests accidentally falls into the pool and she can't swim?
Yeah?
And suppose you jump in with your clothes on and save her life?
Well, you might got something there.
Might got?
It's absolutely inspired.
It's the greatest.
You'll be the lead item in Hedda's column the very next day.
We'll try it.
Oh, hi, honey.
Oh, hello.
Charlie, this is my wife.
Lucy, Charlie Pomerantz.
Nice to meet you.
How do you do, Mr. Pomerantz?
It's very nice to meet you.
I'm sorry I have to pop off like this.
Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye, honey.
Now, what we need is a good-looking, young girl who could use some publicity.
Uh-huh.
Yes?
You wanted a young girl that was good-looking?
Well, I'm I'm I want some publicity.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, you can't save your own wife.
Nobody would ever believe it.
Yeah.
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.
Hey, that might be a wonderful gimmick, saving your own wife.
Might be just daring enough to make it.
Oh, I don't know, Charlie.
Oh, come on, Rick, let's give it a try.
Well, I All right.
Good!
What do I do?
Oh, it's easy.
All you do is fall in a pool with your clothes on.
Well, I think I can What?
Look, Ricky is gonna be singing at the tea.
He'll jump in and save you.
You will?
Well, all right.
I'd like to do that.
Besides, I told all my friends in New York I was going to make a big splash in Hollywood.
Oh!
Oh, my.
You look lovely, dear.
Thank you, Mother.
You didn't have to get that dressed up just for my company.
Your what?
My company, dear.
That nice lady I met on the plane.
I told you I invited her to tea this afternoon.
Oh, Mother.
I'm sorry, but Ricky and I can't be here this afternoon.
Well!
Well, this is a pretty kettle of fish and I was only doing it for Mickey's sake.
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Mother, but Ricky made plans to sing at a tea down by the pool this afternoon and I'm going to Well, I I have to be with him.
I told you yesterday I'd invited her.
Oh, dear.
Well, come on, honey.
We got to get downstairs.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Ingrate!
I wish that just once your Mother would get my name right.
Mother Mother, couldn't you tell the lady that we're busy and that we'll see her another day?
I certainly could not.
What's the problem now?
Oh, well, the lady that Mother met on the plane is coming to tea this afternoon, and Mother is upset because we're not going to be here.
And I only invited her to meet you, Mickey.
She's in the newspaper business.
What does she do, sell 'em?
Oh, Ricky!
Now, look, Mother, we appreciate your trying to help, really we do, but there's just nothing we can do about this today.
Oh, horsefeathers.
Oh, dear.
I'm afraid we hurt her feelings.
Well, honey, I'm sorry.
Nothing we can do about it.
Come on.
Let's go.
Oh  They call me Cuban Pete I'm the king of the rhumba beat When I play the maracas I go chick-chicky, boom, chick-chicky, boom Yes, sir, I'm Cuban Pete I'm the craze on my native street When I start to dance Everything goes chick-chicky boom , chick-chicky, boom The senoritas, they sing How they swing with a sombrero is very nice So full of spice And when they're dancing, they bring A happy ring of a vaquero Singing a song All the day long So, senoritas, please Take a lesson from Cuban Pete And I'll teach you to chick-chicky boom Chick-chicky boom, chick-chicky boom Si, senorita, I know That you will like the chicky-boom-chick 'Cause it's the dance Of Latin romance And Cuban Pete doesn't teach you in a hurry Like Arthur Murray I come from Havana And there's always manana So, senorita, please Take it easy Do it with ease And you'll love it when you do the chick The chicky-boom With Cuban Pete.
Thanks.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Where's Hedda Hooper?
She'll be here.
She'll be here.
Now relax.
You know, Charlie, I'm not sure I'll recognize Hedda.
I've never seen her in person.
You can't miss her.
You just look for the craziest hat you ever saw and Hedda will be underneath it.
: I've heard that about her.
Are you sure she's coming?
Oh, now, keep cool.
Just trust old Charlie.
She'll be here.
Maybe you'd better play another number, huh, Rick?
Play the one I like, doll.
Okay.
Yes.
Hey hey, there she is!
There's Hedda!
Go!
Go!
Come on!
Go!
Go!
Go ahead!
Go!
Go-go-go-go!
Oh, no, wait!
Be careful.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Better stay away from the edge.
Yeah, I will.
I'm sorry, honey.
I-I-I thought it was her.
It sure looked like her hat.
Well, that's all right, but, uh, what are we gonna do about him?
If I jump in, he'll save me before I hit the water.
I'll take care of him.
Hi!
Uh, now, Burt Oh, pardon me.
I thought you were Burt Lancaster.
Well, I've seen you someplace.
You are in the movies, aren't you?
No, but I'd sure like to be.
Well, a guy with your build and looks, shouldn't have any trouble.
Say, you know, you're just great for the lead in Esther Williams' new picture.
I am?
Yeah.
You know, you don't happen to have a picture of yourself handy, do you?
Yeah, I got some right in my locker.
I kind of figured you would have.
Why don't you go get me one of those pictures and I'll show it to some producers I know out at Metro, huh?
Hey, thanks!
Yeah, pick out a good one.
Okay.
Take your time.
Attaboy.
You know, sometimes, my brain amazes even me.
: You sure got rid of him.
Had to do it.
Listen, are you sure she's coming?
Now, will you please not worry about it, Rick?
I said she'd be here, she'd be here.
Trust Charlie, will you?
She'll be here.
Telephone for Mr. Ricardo.
Telephone for Mr..
Here, Bobby.
Come in and take it in the lobby, sir.
Okay.
Hurry it up, Rick, huh?
Okay.
You know, I just can't understand it.
Hedda has made this function every year for the last ten years.
I know she's gonna be here.
Well, she'll be here, Charlie.
Wait a minute.
There she is.
There's her hat!
That's a hat?
I know it's her favorite!
I can't miss it.
Now go ahead, go ahead.
Do your stuff.
But Ricky isn't here!
I'll go get him.
Don't you worry about a thing.
But Charlie, Ricky He'll be here in time.
Now you just go-go-go-go on!
There we are.

Say something to me, honey.
Talk to me.
Hello.
She's all right.
Kids, kids.
It wasn't Hedda after all.
What?
What?
It was just an old potted plant.
What?
!
Lucy!
Mickey!
What happened?
Well, we-we had an idea, but it turned out to be all wet.
Oh, dear.
Well, anyway, you're in time to meet my company.
She's in seeing little Ricky.
Oh!
Mrs. McGillicuddy, what an adorable child!
He's almost cuter than my granddaughter.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Uh, Lucy , Mickey, I'd like you to meet my good friend Hedda Hopper.
How do you  Your mother's told me so much about you two.
You know, I do wish I could stay and chat, but I was due at a party downstairs an hour ago.
Uh is it raining outside?
No?
And they say I wear crazy hats.
Well, thank you for everything, Mrs. McGillicuddy.
MRS.
McGILLICUDDY: Good-bye, Hedda.
And it's nice meeting you.
Mother, dear why didn't you tell us it was Hedda Hooper?
You didn't ask me.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Poor little guy.
He was asleep before I got his pajamas on.
That was some walk you took him on.
I took him on?
He took me on.
Aw, I never was so tired in my life.
What's that you're reading, Mother-- Variety?
Bought it in the lobby.
It's very interesting.
Oh, come now, I bet you don't understand a word it says.
Well, there's one item I do understand in here.
Oh?
I didn't think Mickey had made his picture yet.
He hasn't, and his name isn't Mickey.
Well, whatever his name is, they got it wrong in here.
They say that the picture's all finished and it's been put in storage.
What?
Where does it say that?
Says right here.
"Metro shelves Don Juan".
Oh, no!
You mean he didn't even tell you he made the picture?
Oh, no, Mother, you don't understand.
They haven't made the picture and "shelved" means they're not going to.
Lucy Luc I saw it.
How's Ricky taking it?
He hasn't seen it yet.
He's still in the shower.
Oh, what do you suppose happened?
Oh, gosh, this is awful.
He hasn't even started yet and already he's a has-been.
He isn't even a has-been, he's a never-was.
California, here we go.
We might as well start packing.
I just got out here.
Now I have to go back home without seeing anything.
Oh, I haven't even seen Palm Springs.
I can beat that.
Well, will you listen to us.
What do you mean?
Here we are complaining, thinking only about ourselves, and Ricky's whole career is ruined.
Oh, she's right.
Lucy, I'm so ashamed.
I was only thinking of myself.
I was only thinking of myself.
And I was only thinking of Lana Turner.
Oh, Fred!
Lucy, how are we gonna break this to him?
We just won't tell him.
Give me that.
What are you gonna do?
Oh, Lucy!
That won't do any good; he'll see it anyway.
Oh, even if he doesn't, the studio will tell him the picture's been shelved.
Well, we have to cushion the blow somehow.
Lucy?
Yes, dear?
Uh, uh, yes, dear?
Where's my blue tie?
Oh, it's uh it's o Yeah, yeah, never mind, I got it, I found it.
Now, listen, when he comes out here, act like nothing happened.
Just be natural and leave everything to me.
What are you gonna do?
Well, I'll, I'll, I'll probably bring the conversation around to how homesick we all are and how we don't care much about Hollywood anyway, you know.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Whatever you do, don't let the cat out of the bag.
Oh, don't worry.
As far as he's concerned, we never even saw that item in Variety.
And for heaven's sake, smile.
Look happy or he'll know that something's wrong.
Oh, hi, everybody.
Hello, dear.
Hi, Ricky.
How are you?
Hi, Rick, old boy.
How's tricks?
How's tricks?
Hello, son.
My, you're certainly all happy this morning.
Sure.
Well, there's nothing to be sad about.
No.
We didn't even see that item in Variety.
What item?
Oh, it's nothing, dear.
It was just a mention.
It didn't say a thing about the picture being shelved.
Oh!
That cat wasn't let out of the bag.
It was yanked out.
What are you talking about?
Oh, honey, it was just a little item in Variety about your picture being shelved, but it doesn't matter.
Who wants to be in pictures anyway?
Feh!
Is that what you're worried about?
Just one little item in the paper?
Uh-huh.
Well, honey, that's just publicity.
Sure, you know, they want the people to keep talking about the picture.
They'll do anything out here to keep a picture alive.
Even kill it?
Sure.
Look, if we weren't gonna make the picture, don't you think I'd be the first one to know?
Well, yeah, I suppose so.
Of course, honey.
This afternoon I'm going to the studio to make some tests with the leading lady.
Oh?
Now, they wouldn't be making tests if they were gonna cancel the picture.
No, I guess not.
Of course not.
Oh, boy, am I relieved!
Oh, thank goodness, my trip isn't ruined.
And I'll get to see Palm Springs after all.
Yeah.
Dry those tears, Lana.
You should have asked me, then you wouldn't have been worried.
Oh, boy.
Hello?
Yes, this is Ricky Ricardo.
What?
They are?
Do you know why?
You don't?
I see.
Yes, I'll be here.
Thank you for calling.
What's the matter, dear?
Who was that?
The studio.
They're canceling the test this afternoon.
Well but why?
They didn't say why.
Oh, well, honey, that doesn't mean anything.
Of course not.
It's just publicity.
Sure.
Yeah.
They also said that Dore Schary wants to see me here tomorrow afternoon.
I've heard that name before.
Now, who's Dore Schary?
Well, that's good, isn't it, honey?
His wanting to see you here?
No, that's bad.
Who's Dore Schary?
Oh, he's he's someone at Metro, dear.
Well, what does he do at Metro?
Oh, he's a big shot.
Well, just what does he do?
Oh, he's the guy that twists the lion's tail when they want him to  Oh, Fred!
Well, honey honey, why is it bad?
I don't understand.
Well, don't you see, honey?
When a big man like Mr. Schary's gonna come all the way out here, it must be just to make it nice while he's firing me.
Oh, dear.
I guess he's right.
Well, honey, don't you care.
At least we got a trip to California out of it.
Short as it was.
Oh, Mother, please.
Oh, I can't stand it anymore.
I got to walk to the studio, find out what it's all about.
Oh, well, you're right, dear.
You demand to know.
You're hardworking all of a sudden they cancel.
Yeah, I know, honey.
I don't understand.
Well, you have a right to know, dear.
Oh, I could cry.
He looked so disappointed.
Poor Mickey.
Aw, poor Ricky.
If he just made one picture, I know that the women of America would have gone absolutely mad about his big, brown eyes.
Yeah.
That fan mail would have flooded the studio.
Well, there's no use dreaming.
That's it!
Fan mail.
Fan mail?
Yeah.
What do you think if all that flood of fan mail reached the studio by tomorrow morning?
I'll bet Dore Schary would think twice about letting him go if the people of America were just demanding to see more of Ricky Ricardo.
More of him?
He hasn't even been on the screen yet.
Who's gonna write him a fan letter?
You got it.
Lucy?
Listen, everybody, the next hundred letters we write ask for Ricky's picture, and don't forget to change your handwriting.
Yeah, Fred, be sure and change your handwriting or they'll think they're all from the same person.
I did change my handwriting.
Look I wrote the last hundred with my left.
Your left what?
Foot?
They'll think a chicken wants his autograph.
Oh, come on, cut the gab.
You're holding up the production line.
Well, I'm going as fast as I can, but my hand's getting a cramp.
Mine, too.
Oh, for heaven's sake, we've only written 500 letters.
Your hands can't be that cramped.
Tell that to my hand.
Oh, Ethel, you sure are a sissy.
Well, haven't you got writer's cramp?
No.
Let me see your hand.
Put down your pen.
Now wiggle your fingers.
Having a little trouble?
Well, after all we have written 500 letters.
How about a little breather?
Okay.
Say,		 why don't I take all these downstairs and mail them.
Oh, that's a good idea, Mother.
Oh, Lucy, my whole shoulder's sore.
Me, too.
I feel like I just pitched three games in the World Series.
Well, now, remember, we're doing this for Ricky's sake.
You think 500 letters will do any good?
No, but 5,000 will.
Oh, Lucy, I don't think I can make it.
Now, don't forget, Ethel, if Ricky doesn't get into the movies, you don't get to stay in California.
What's the good of staying in California, if I have to go around with my arm in a sling?
Hello.
He is?
Did he see you, Mother?
Okay, thanks.
Ricky's on his way up from the lobby.
Get rid of all the stuff.
Oh, hide everything, Fred.
Hide everything now.
Ethel, hand me that ink well.
Hurry up.
: Oh!
Fred, I'm sorry!
What's the matter?
Look, I slammed the drawer on your hand.
Oh, how do you like that?
It's so numb, I didn't even feel it.
Oh, Fred I'm sorry.
Oh You all right?
Gee, I'm sorry, Fred.
Take a magazine.
Just sit back and read it.
Oh, hi, dear.
FRED AND  Hi, Rick.
Bueno, parece que ya se acabo todo.
Oh, really?
How were things at the studio, Rick?
Did they shelve the picture?
Yeah, they sure did.
Oh They can't do that to you.
Well, they just did it.
There's no doubt about it.
Metro just gave me the door in the fence.
What's that?
Well, you ought to know, it's an American 'spression.
Are you sure that's an American 'spression?
Yeah.
They gave me the door in the fence.
Oh, they gave you the gate!
That's what I said.
I'm washed up.
Finished.
Did you see Mr. Schary today?
No, but they're shoveling the picture.
What if they do shovel it?
Maybe they'll put you in another one.
Oh, sure.
Yeah, yeah.
Maybe they're gonna use me in one of the Marx Brothers' pictures, you know, Chico, Harpo, Groucho, and Floppo.
Aw, honey, now, don't you worry.
I have a feeling that the public will make itself heard.
What public?
Yeah, well Maybe I could borrow a couple hundred bobby-soxers from Sinatra.
This is Ricky Ricardo.
Are you sure you haven't got any calls for me from Mr. Dore Schary?
Oh, I can't understand it.
He was supposed to be in here half an hour ago.
All right, thank you.
Hello?
What?
Who's on his way up?
The Ricky Ricardo Fan Club?
All right.
Come in.
There he is!
That's Ricky Ricardo!
Let me have your autograph, please.
Come on, Rick!
Got it!
Yeah, that's great.
Where's Dore Schary?
Now, what do you think you're doing?
Where's Dore Schary?
He's not here yet.
All right, back in the hall.
Make another entrance.
Now, just a minute, just a minute.
Hold it, everybody.
Nobody's gonna make another entrance anywhere.
Well, don't you want us to help you?
No!
Good.
I was gonna feel pretty silly telling him I slept with your picture under my pillow!
No.
Well, we only wanted to help you.
Well, then get out of here.
Oh, that's gratitude for you.
Yeah.
Give me Texas 0-3311, please.
Mr. Schary's office.
Mr. Schary's office.
Now, Miss Ballantine, this is Ricky Ricardo calling.
Oh, yes.
Look, have I got my dates mixed up or something?
Am I not supposed to have an appointment with Mr. Schary today?
Why, yes.
Isn't he there yet?
No.
Oh, he's probably still tied up at the Producer's Association meeting at the hotel.
That's why he was gonna meet you there.
Oh.
And he said he'd be back here by He has a very important appointment with Mr. Stevens.
Well, that's 25 minutes from now.
Well, in that case, perhaps you'd better come out to the studio.
Then you'll be sure to see him.
Okay, I'll, I'll be right there.
Good-bye.
You can have your fan club meeting here.
I'm going to the studio.
: Where Oh, no!
Where is Mickey Ricardo?
Oh, brother!
Hello.
This is Dore Schary.
May I have my office, please?
Mr. Schary's office.
Miss Ballantine, I won't be back at the studio this afternoon.
But what about your appointment with Mr. Stevens?
Oh, Mr. Stevens' is at the lunch and then we're having our meeting here and then I'm going to drop in on Ricky Ricardo.
But Mr. Ricardo's on his way to the studio.
Well, uh, will you call him back, please, and see if he's left yet?
Yes, sir.
Let me know.
I'm down by the pool.
All right.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
I still say we should go right out there and bust into Dore Schary's office.
They wouldn't even let us through the gate.
Oh  Hello?
This is Mr. Schary's secretary.
Has Mr. Ricardo left yet?
Oh, yes, he has.
Oh, dear.
Do you suppose you could possibly catch him?
Mr. Schary still wants to meet him at the hotel.
Oh, yes, I can catch him.
I'll call the garage.
What's up?
Dore Schary's coming here after all.
I have to catch Ricky.
Oh, no, I don't.
Oh, Lucy, hurry up.
He'll be gone in a minute.
Yeah.
What now, blue eyes?
You know, maybe it's better if Ricky doesn't talk to Dore Schary right now.
In his frame of mind, he'd probably say the wrong thing anyway.
So?
So, we can approach it from an entirely different angle.
How?
Suppose when Mr. Schary arrives, there's another big producer here just dying to get Ricky under contract.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, where do we find somebody that looks like a big, important producer?
Oh, that's a tough one.
Somebody who looks like a real important producer.
Well, don't just stand there, Fred.
Try to think of somebody.
Well!
Hey, the lobby's always full of actors and there're always a lot of them around the pool.
Suppose we find one and pay him to do the job?
Great!
Now wait a minute.
I doubt if they'd take you seriously in that getup.
Oh, that's right.
Change and meet me back here right away.
All right.
Well, this meeting has been very helpful, Dore.
I'll get back to you in a day or two.
Thank you, Jim.
Good talking to you.
Can I drop you at the studio?
No, thanks.
I have another engagement here.
Fine.
I'll see you.
Bye.
Would you ring the Ricky Ricardo suite for me, please?
Oh, honestly, you'd think there'd be one actor in that lobby up there today, wouldn't you?
There's always about two dozen hanging around.
Boy, it's pretty discouraging.
Well, there's none down here either.
: Lucy?
What?
What about him?
Nah.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Would you ring that again, please.
Hi, Mrs. Ricardo.
Hi, Bobby.
Oh, hi, Bobby.
Hey, Bobby, maybe you can help us.
Sure.
What can I do for you?
Well, listen, Ricky's picture was shelved.
Yeah, I know.
I saw it in Variety.
Yeah, well, Mr. Dore Schary is coming up to our apartment in a few minutes to have a little talk with Ricky.
Can I bring you up some ice water?
I've never even seen Dore Schary.
No, I'm afraid not, Bobby.
There's gonna be too much going on.
Now, look, I have a plan.
I thought if we had another big producer there that was just dying to put Ricky under contract, then Mr. Schary wouldn't fire Ricky, see?
You know, you're right.
These big producers always want you when somebody else wants you.
Mm.
What a bunch of eggheads.
Yeah.
You can say that again.
Yeah.
Well, you know where we can find an actor real quick that could play the producer?
We'll pay $10.
Producer, huh?
Uh-huh.
: Now, see here, Dore, I simply must have Ricardo for my next picture.
Oh, no, Bobby, I'm afraid you're not the type.
I got shoes that make me four inches higher.
Four inches higher?
How do you look?
I look all right, but my ears pop.
Oh, Bobby.
Thanks, anyway.
Be sure and tell me if you see any producer-type actors around, huh?
Yes, ma'am.
Gee, we gotta find somebody and soon.
Come on.
Uh, pardon me.
I couldn't help overhearing.
Are you looking for an actor?
Well, yes, I am.
Well, I'm an actor.
Well, I'm afraid you won't do.
You see, we're looking for someone who looks like a producer.
I've, uh I've been told that I look like a producer.
You?
The bellboy looks more like a producer than you do.
Now, Lucy, there's not much time and he is willing.
Oh, I'm willing.
Besides, I could use the ten bucks.
Well, you're not exactly the type we're looking for.
Um, would you do it for $7.50?
All right, it's a deal.
Okay, come on.
I don't usually work this cheap, but things are tough, what with television and all.
Yeah, I know, I know.
Ethel?
Oh, Lucy?
Lucy.
Well, Fred, we found one down by the pool.
Is that the best you could do?
Well, we didn't have much choice.
It was either him or the bellboy.
He doesn't look like a producer.
He's dressed all wrong.
What's the matter with my clothes?
Well, you just don't look like a producer.
You look like a banker or a businessman or something.
Yeah, a real square.
Yeah.
Hey, maybe I got something in my closet that'll sharpen him up a little.
Hey, Fred, go get your sport coat.
Right.
Uh, now, listen, uh uh, what's your name?
Uh, Spelvin.
George Spelvin.
Oh, well, listen, George.
Here's the situation.
Now, my husband Ricky Ricardo is under contract to MGM.
Was.
Now, Ethel, we don't know.
And Dore Schary is a big shot at MGM.
Yes, I've heard of him.
Yeah.
Well, he's due here in a few minutes and we think he's going to fire Ricky.
Now, we want you to pretend that you're a big producer from another studio and offer Ricky a contract.
Well, do you think, uh, do you think Schary will go for a gag like that?
Well, why shouldn't he?
Well, I hear he's pretty bright.
Bright?
If he's letting Ricky go, he's pretty stupid.
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, uh, wouldn't he know all the other big producers in town?
Gee, that's right.
Well, now, maybe he'd better be a producer from back East or from Europe.
A foreign producer.
Can you do an accent?
Not for $7.50.
Well, let me hear your accent.
I might go to ten dollars.
: I just come here from Sweden.
I want to talk to Ricky Ricardo about making a picture for me in Sweden.
Back to $7.50.
Well, I thought that was pretty good.
Here's just the thing you need.
Okay.
Take off your coat, George.
Oh, this is great.
Okay.
Put this on now.
Now.
There.
Now he looks like a producer.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's more like it.
Now now, try to look important.
Stand up straight.
Hold in your stomach.
I think he's the type that should be sitting down.
Sit down.
Now, get comfortable.
Cross your legs.
Now, try to say something in a real cultured tone of voice.
Say, um : Now, look here, Dore.
I want that very talented Ricky Ricardo in a big musical I'm making.
Now, look here, Dore.
Ah, way down here.
Way down here.
Now, look here, Dore.
Now, look here, Dore.
I want that talented Ricky Ricardo for a musical A big musical.
A big musical I'm making.
And money is no object.
And m and m and I just can't bring myself to say that.
Listen, do you want the job or not?
Well Then say money is no object.
And money is no object.
What's the matter?
It leaves a bad taste in your mouth, doesn't it?
Hi, everybody.
Oh, hi, dear Oh!
Hi, dear.
Uh wel Hi, honey.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I went to the studio.
Well, uh, do you two people know each other?
Of course we know each other.
Who do you think I had an appointment with?
Dore Schary.
Well?
Well?
Who who who who Who who who.
What's the matter?
You sound like an owl.
Who who is he?
Mr. Dore Schary.
Uh, so long, Ricky.
Nice being married to you.
Wait a minute.
What's the matter with you?
Well, nothing yet.
You have a very attractive wife, Ricky.
We've just been sitting here chatting.
We have?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We have.
Oh, yeah.
Mr. Schary's quite a chatterer.
Yeah.
Yeah, and-and he's so bright and intelligent and charming.
Thank you, Mrs. Ricardo.
Ricky, I came over here to tell you about that item in the paper.
Oh, yes.
It's true we are shelving Don Juan.
Too many production problems.
: Oh But we're going to pick up your option and we're going to put you in another picture just as soon as we can find the right one.
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
Well, thank you.
Thank you for having so much confidence in me.
We have, Ricky.
I just wanted to tell you in person.
Thank you very much.
And good-bye.
Good-bye.
Mrs. Ricardo  Mrs. Mertz.
Good-bye, Mr. Schary.
Bye.
It's been delightful.
Oh.
I can't remember when I had a more charming afternoon.
Well, thank you, Mr. Schary.
Thanks for coming now, Mr. Schary.
Good-bye, sir.
Thanks a lot.
Oh Isn't that wonderful?
How about that?
Isn't that great?
Hey, I owe you an apology.
What about?
About your-your taste in clothes.
Mr. Schary's wearing a sport coat just like yours.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, Ricky, I'm so happy for you.
Say, I'll bet that fan mail had a lot to do with it.
What fan mail?
Oh, wait till you find out what we did for you, boy.
Yeah, what?
Yeah, well Hi, Bobby.
Hi.
Say, Mrs. Ricardo, you know anything about these letters?
Somebody left them down on top of the mailbox without any stamps.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Come in.
Oh, hi, Ross.
Hi, Lucy.
Ricky isn't here right now, but he'll be back in a few minutes.
That's all right.
I came over to talk to you.
Oh?
Lucy, I just set Ricky for a big spread in Photoplay magazine.
Article, pictures, the works.
Wow, wonderful.
What did you want to talk to me about?
Well, about the article.
You're a very important part of it.
I am?
Sure.
You see, now that Don Juan is called off, we can play up the fact that Ricky is married, and the article is going to be entitled "What it's like to be married to Ricky Ricardo," by you.
By me?
That's right.
"What it's like to be married to Ricky Ricardo".
You think you can handle it?
Handle it?
I'm an expert in the field.
Good.
Hi.
There he is.
Hi, Ross.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Ricky.
You've been waiting for me?
No.
I came over to see Lucy.
Oh.
We were just discussing an article about you for Photoplay magazine.
You and Lucy were discussing it?
Yeah, it's called "What it's like to be married to Ricky Ricardo" by me.
Oh, oh, I see.
You gonna write it and then you gonna put Lucy's name No, no, Ricky.
We want this to be an honest, sincere account of exactly the way Lucy feels about you.
What's the matter with you?
You crazy or something?
What are you afraid of, Ricky?
Haven't got enough "'sperience".
I've been married to you longer than anybody.
I don't mean that.
I mean you you haven't got enough 'sperience in writing.
She doesn't need any, Ricky.
They gave me a list of questions.
All they want Lucy to do is fill in the answers.
See?
Well, uh, I guess it's all right.
Well, fine.
Here are the questions, Lucy, and send the answers to that address, huh?
Okay.
I'll do it right away.
Well, I'd better be going.
I'm setting up a big television show for you, Ricky.
Good!
I'll see you later.
All right.
Oh, and Lucy, Yeah.
Don't be afraid of it.
Put it down in your own words.
Be natural.
I will.
Okay.
Good-bye, Ross.
Bye.
All right, thank you.
Well, what kind of questions are they?
Well, let's see now.
Question number one: "are you happily married"?
Question number two: "Does Ricky snore"?
Question number three: "What kind of husbands do Latins really make"?
: Oh, this is gonna be fun.
Yeah, yeah.
Ha, ha, ha.
Uh listen, uh, you, y-you sure you don't want me to help you with the answers?
No, no, no.
Now, I have to do this all by myself.
Now, you go away and leave me alone.
Go over there and sit down on the chair and read your paper.
Yeah, well.
Just leave me be.
Let's see now, first question.
"Are you happily married"?
Had you worried for a minute there, didn't I?
Yeah.
Question number two: "Does Ricky snore"?
What's that, all that other stuff you're writing there now?
I'm just answering the question about snoring.
Yeah, but weren't the first two letters, "n-o"?
They were "o-h".
"O-h"?
And the second word was "b-r-o-t-h-e-r".
B-r-o-t-h What's all that other stuff you're writing there now?
Just a few descriptive passages.
Now, just a minute.
Just a minute.
I want to see, I want to see what you're writing.
No, no, no!
Now just go away.
You can't see this.
Go back and sit down in your chair and leave me alone.
Oh, all right.
I'll go in the other room.
All right.
Let's see now, "What kind of husbands do Latins really make"?
How'd you know I was here?
I heard you breathing.
Now, go on back.
Go on, get out of here!
Now, I got a right to know what you're writing there.
You have no right to see this until it comes out in the magazine.
Now I mean it.
Now go away and leave me alone!
I got a right to know what you're hiding.
You have no right to see it and I'm supposed to do the Come back here, you two!
I'm supposed to do You go on and get out of here.
Hey, what's going on?
I'm supposed to write an article about Ricky all by myself and he won't let me alone.
An article?
Yeah, it's for Photoplay magazine.
It's called "What it's like to be married to Ricky Ricardo" and I have a lot of questions I have to answer.
Oh, boy, what an opportunity.
I wish I'd get a chance to write an article like that.
Aah, who'd buy it-- True Horror Stories?
Oh, you funny, funny woman.
All right, everybody, I cannot create with a crowd around.
Now, look, Lucy, you listen to me Look, Ricky, I'll make a deal with you.
If you'll go away and let me answer these questions, I promise I'll let you see them before I send them in.
You promise?
I promise.
Come on, Ricky.
We'll take you down to Will Wright's and buy you an ice cream soda.
Now, Ethel, we're not going there again today.
Yes, we are now, Fred.
They've got 24 flavors, and I've only tasted 20.
Come on, Rick.
I'll need you to help me push her through the door.
Take your time, everybody.
I want to do a good job on my first big assignment.
Yeah, well, but just watch what, you know Never mind now.
Hello.
Oh, no, Ross.
He just left.
You did?
Oh, that's wonderful.
Wait a minute now.
I'll write it down.
"TV, Coast To Coast.
Ricky's gonna emcee the Heart Fund".
Oh, gee, Ross, that's wonderful.
Say, I don't suppose they might need a pretty girl to lead the guest stars up to the microphone, huh?
Yeah, well, I happen to know a redhead who Oh, they have.
Oh, well, okay.
Uh, say, Ross  I, uh, I just happened to have a thought.
Ross, instead of my writing that article for the magazine, how about you getting someone to interview me and ask those questions about Ricky on that program?
And that way, people all over America could How's that?
Oh, well, all right.
I'll mail it into the magazine.
Okay.
Yeah, I'll, I'll give it to him the minute he comes in.
Ross?
Ross, I don't know if I ever told you, but, you know, I play "Glowworm" on the saxophone, and I have sort of an act built around it where I Ross?
Ross?
Oh, Ross?
Operator, you cut us off.
Oh, he did?
Okay, thanks.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
How's the article coming?
Fine.
I'm all finished.
Good.
Hey, Ross called.
There's a message on the desk there.
Yeah?
Hey, this is great.
Television show Coast To Coast for the Heart Fund, huh?
Yeah, Ross seemed pretty excited about it.
Uh, Ricky?
Yeah.
About the television show, I have a question for you.
Well, I'm pretty sure what it is and I have an answer for you.
Well, I'm pretty sure what your answer is but let me ask it anyway.
All right.
Can I be on the show?
No.
Ten seconds.
That's the fastest we've ever done it.
That's all you're gonna say?
You're not gonna get mad or anything?
Why should I get mad?
I get a sinkin' filling in my stomach when you get that look in your face.
Oh, don't be silly.
Why should you get a "sinkin' filling"?
After all, if you don't want me on the show, that's your business.
Well, I must say, you're very understanding.
Hmm, sure, just forget I asked.
Good.
Now, would you like to see my answers to these questions?
Yeah, I sure would.
Which set would you like to see?
Which set?
Yes, I made an alternate set.
These are about my dear, darling husband who's such a considerate angel, and these are about the dirty rat who won't let me be on the show.
You wouldn't dare.
Oh, wouldn't I?
But that's blackmail!
Oh, come now, let's not call it that.
That's what it is.
I know, but let's not call it that.
Now, would you like to hear me read these?
Never mind, never mind.
I know when I'm licked.
Then I can be on the show?
Yes.
Cuban Scout's honor?
Cuban Scout's honor.
Thank you, dear.
Now then, what will we do on the Heart Fund benefit?
I have a few ideas.
Listen Now, if you don't mind, uh, I'll decide what we'll do on the show, all right?
Well After all, blackmailers can't be shoosers.
I just want to make sure you "shoose" something that shows me off.
You just don't worry about that, all right?
You just mail this thing and leave the rest up to me.
I'll take care of you.
That's what I'm afraid of.
No, no, really, I got something for you to do.
Something good.
Scout's honor.
Well, okay.
Skiddereatheroo Hey!
Skiddereatheroo Hey!
Shake hands with all your neighbors And kiss the Colleens all You're as welcome as the flowers in May In dear old Donegal.
Well, that's fine.
Great.
Yes, sir, that'll be great in the show.
Hi, everybody.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
What kept you?
Oh, honey, I had to wait for Mother to get back from the hairdresser's so she could take care of the baby.
Oh, that's right.
But I'm here now.
Come on, let's rehearse.
Okay, let's see now.
Let me get your Here's your music.
Oh, boy!
I get to sing, huh?
La da "Humoresque"?
I'm not the "humoresque" type.
Why don't you let me sing a song that's more of my style, like Let me go, let me go Let me go, lover Let me go, let me go Let me go, lover Wait.
Hey, hey, hold on, lover.
Look, after hearing that, I'm tempted to really let you go, lover.
Oh, stop.
Now, this is a very cute bit.
It's kind of a musical trick.
See, we sing two songs at dif the same time.
Two songs at the same time?
That's right, but they work out together all right.
Oh?
Fred, you know the bit, don't you?
Sure.
You to show it to her?
Yeah, I don't mind.
Let Fred do it for you, then you can see what I mean.
You sing "Humoresque," and I'll sing "Swanee River".
All right.
One two Way down upon Song of many joys, The Swanee River My magic song of sweet rejoice Keep ringing Until night is gone Far, far away.
My humoresque.
There's where my heart Let the music play, Is yearning ever And let the smiling stars display their beauty There's where the old folks stay.
In a gold arabesque.
Hey, that's wonderful!
I think I can do that.
You think so?
Yeah.
Okay.
Here you are, honey.
Now, you sing "Humoresque" and I'll sing "Swanee River".
: Yeah.
You ready?
Okay.
Give us a key there, Marco.
Give you two.
One, two Way down upon Songs of many joys The Swanee River My magic song of sweet rejoicing keep ringing Far, far away.
My humoresque.
There's There's where my heart is yearning ever No, no.
What's the matter?
You started singing "Swanee River".
You got to stick to "Humoresque".
You switched.
Oh, I thought something sounded funny.
Well, I know "Swanee River" so much better.
Why don't you let me sing that.
Oh, sure, honey, here.
Okay.
You ready, Marco?
Give us a  One, two : Way, way, way, way, way Way Way down upon the Swanee River Wait, hold on, wait a minute What's the matter?
Honey, you got to wait for me.
We got to do it together.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
On two.
One, two Way down upon Song of many joys The Swanee River My magic song of sweet rejoicing keep ringing Far, far, far, far away Until night is gone, my humoresque.
There is where my heart Is turning, turning, turning, turning, turning There is where the old folks stay.
You just can't do it.
You can't do it at all.
What do you mean I can't do it?
You said I could be in the show.
Well, honey, I'm sorry, but I tried.
You can't do this and I got the whole show routine.
There's nothing for you to do.
Well, gi-give me something else to do.
I'm sorry, honey.
The whole show is already a routine.
There is nothing that you can do.
Oh, isn't there?
It's a good thing I didn't mail this.
I guess I'll have to mail them my revised copy after all.
I thought you tore that up.
What did you do, paste it together?
No.
I just saved a carbon copy in case of an emergency.
And this, my Latin lover, is an emergency.
Uh, yeah, well, wute wait a minute.
On second thought, I think there is something in there that you can do.
Oh.
What is it?
It's a Spanish dance number.
Spanish dance number.
I can do that.
Come on, let's rehearse it.
Well, uh, if you don't mind, I would like to go to the mailbox and drop the right answers in the box first.
Okay.
Honestly, did you ever see anybody stick to an idea like Lucy?
She's a regular human mustard plaster.
Where did Ricky go?
Oh, he went down to the corner, but he'll be back in a minute.
Oh, I just wanted to check with him on this costume.
It's for the Spanish dance-- the matador number.
I'll catch him later.
Just a minute.
Does somebody's head go in there?
Yeah.
Uh, this isn't by any chance a Spanish dance between a lady matador and a Cuban bull, is it?
No, Ricky's the matador.
I don't know who he's got for the bull.
Oh, brother!
What'll Lucy do when she finds out she's the bull?
She'll probably gore him.
I think I'd better warn her.
Now, Ethel, do me a favor and keep your big bazoo shut.
Okay.
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Oh, boy, this is a switch.
For once, the bull will be full of Lucy.
Shh!
Well, we mailed it.
Let's get on with the rehearsal.
Uh, all right, now, here's how the way that the Spanish, uh, dance number goes, you see.
Uh-huh.
I come out and I sing a few bars and then you make your entrance.
Uh-huh.
Okay, now, you come from here, and you come like this.
Like that?
Yeah, that's right.
Like that.
Go on.
Try it.
Try it.
No, no, no.
No, honey.
Don't, don't snap your fingers, dear.
Well, I'm pretending I have castanets in them.
Well, the part you play doesn't use any castanets.
No castanets?
Do it again without the castanets.
Go ahead.
Go on.
Are you sure this is right?
That's right.
I've seen very few Spanish dancers in this position.
Well, honey, the song explains the whole thing.
I'm not by any chance a senorita with lumbago, am I?
No, no.
Let me explain it to you, honey.
Look.
You see, at this part of the number, I go back here and I take out a big red cape.
And as you come on, I go, "Toro!
Toro"!
Toro?
!
Yeah.
Isn't that Spanish for bull?
Yeah.
Ricky Ricardo, you tricked me!
Now, just a minute.
The bull is very important in this number.
It's a very dramatic role.
Oh, sure.
It is, honey.
Now I'm out here, I'm doing this number, and when the bull comes in, you see, you're just ferocious.
You're just fierce and you're just stamping the ground and you're pawing at it and you're wild with rage.
Your only thought is to kill me.
You can say that again.
Well, look, honey, I have given you your chance.
If you don't	 Oh.
want it Some chance.
Hey, Ricky.
Yeah.
The prop department wants to know if this is all right, or do you want them to make some changes?
Yeah, this is fine.
It's silly of me to ask, but what is that?
It's your costume.
My costume?
Yeah.
Oh, she going to wear this?
Well, I thought she was, but I guess that Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm going to wear it.
Well, good girl.
Good girl.
Shall I tell the prop department it's all right?
Well, now, let me see.
Yeah, I think it looks You know what I would like, though?
I would like a more ferocious, uh, fierce look.
You know, like Let me see that again.
Could you come along and let them see that expression?
I could never describe it.
Hey, I'm surprised, Lucy.
I didn't think you'd go through with it.
Yeah, what made you change your mind?

{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Oh!
You won another game.
You're certainly hot tonight.
Ah, it's just the cards, you know.
Come on, Lucy.
Hey, what are you doing out there?
Oh, I'm just enjoying this sensational California weather.
Imagine a night like this at this time of year.
If we were back home where it's cold, do you know what we'd be doing right now?
Yeah, pounding on the pipes for you to give us more heat.
Baloney.
I mean, if we were back in New York, we'd be out shoveling snow.
You mean I'd be out shoveling snow.
Oh, now, honey, but I only let you shovel the snow because I had to keep an eye on the furnace.
Yeah, to be sure that nobody put any coal in it.
To hear you talk, you'd think I Oh, all right now, you two.
I don't want to start anything.
I just want to make sure that we all appreciate California while we're here.
Yeah.
Hey, Ethel, you know something?
What?
We're gonna get to celebrate our wedding anniversary in California.
What's the matter, Ricky?
Th-The cards are very slippery.
Th-They get out of your hands.
It's hard to shuffle them.
Lucy, I didn't realize you had a wedding anniversary coming up so soon.
From the look on his face, neither did Ricky.
What are you talking about?
I knew we had a wedding anniversary coming up so soon.
You did, huh?
I knew it was coming up.
I was just talking to myself the other day, you know, and saying that how much fun it'd be to celebrate the wedding anniversary here in California.
How about that?
Wouldn't that be fun?
When is it?
"When is it"?
That's a ridiculous question, "When is it"?
I made four spades-- double.
Come on, honey.
Ricky, what day is it?
What day is it?
It's Monday.
Yesterday was Sunday; today is Monday.
Monday.
You know what I mean.
Oh, oh.
Oh, you know, what day is our anniversary on?
Yeah.
Oh, well, uh, our anniversary Hello.
Oh, Mother, darling!
How are you, sweetheart?
So glad to see you, Mother.
Well, you've never been this happy to see me before, Mickey.
"Mickey".
Isn't she a doll?
: Mickey.
Honey, now look, you woke up the baby.
I'm sorry.
Ethel, when is it?
I don't know.
What do you mean you don't know?
You were there at our anniversary party last year.
So were you.
Fred, you remember?
Oh, uh, how about May 3?
That date sticks in my mind for some reason.
Ah, no, no.
Oh, no, no, that's the day I fell down and broke my leg.
Or was that the day I got the gout?
Fred, for your information, May 3 is our wedding anniversary.
Well, I knew it was tied in with some painful memory.
Stop the stale jokes, will you?
Help me think of this.
Let's see.
You know what they ought to do?
They ought to declare a national holiday and let everybody celebrate their anniversary on the same day.
Yeah.
How about April 1?
Yeah.
Honestly.
Uh, Mrs. McGillicuddy, honey Yes?
Do you remember when Lucy got married?
Certainly.
When was it?
Years ago.
No, I mean, uh, what was the date?
Date?
Oh, uh, I'm no good at dates, but, um, it was sometime in the spring.
Thanks a lot.
Looking for something?
Ohhh.
We-we-we got to talking about marriages and everything and I was looking at my beautiful ring.
Well, don't bother.
We didn't have them engraved.
Ricky Ricardo, you have forgotten the date of our anniversary, haven't you?
Certainly not.
All right, then, when is it?
Say, uh, you keep asking me that question a lot of times, uh, I bet that you've forgotten.
I have not.
We were married on Ah.
Oh, no, you don't.
You're not gonna trick me into telling you.
I don't have to trick you into telling.
I know.
You do not.
Oh, yes, I do.
As a matter of fact, uh, I have a whole, uh, party planned at the Mocambo for that night.
Oh, but how can you, Rick, when you don't Deal the cards, Fred!
You have a party planned for what night, Ricky?
Uh, for the night of our anniversary.
And what night is that, Ricky?
Well, darling, if you don't know when your own anniversary is, I'm certainly not going to tell you.
: Hello.
Give me Western Union, please.
Western Union?
I want to send a wire to Greenwich, Gonnecticut, to the head of the License Bureau.

Boy, I'm hungry.
Whoa!
They look good this morning.
Lucy!
What?
Lucy I was very, very disappointed with the way you acted last night.
The way I acted?
Yes.
Thinking that I've forgotten our wedding anniversary.
Well, now, honey All right, when is it?
Now, honey, don't you know that I love you?
Well, yes, but Look, there's just one way you can prove you remember.
All right.
All right, I'll tell you.
But, uh, first give me a hug, huh?
Why?
As a vote of confidence.
: All right.
That's my baby.
How could you possibly think that I'd forgotten our wedding anniversary?
Well, you wouldn't tell me.
Well, darling, I've known all my life that our wedding anniversary has always been on the 7th.
Oh, then you did know.
Yes.
Oh, you're wonderful.
Well, I feel much better now.
So do I. Wait a minute, I'll be right back.
I want to tell Ethel.
Yes, darling.
She said you were just like all other husbands.
Oh, she did, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, is that party still on?
Yeah, oh, yes!
Mmm!
Yes, sir!
Yeah.
The party oy.
Uh, g-g-give me MGM, please.
Ross Elliott's office.
Hello.
Hello, Ross.
Look, this is Ricky Ricardo.
I want you to plant a news item for me.
You see, I forgot the date of our wedding anniversary.
Well, that's not news.
All right, all right.
Now, look, I forgot the date of our wedding anniversary.
So, I told Lucy that I have a big party planned at the Mocambo for that night, the night of the 7th.
Now, can you put something in the paper that, you know, makes it look like the invitations have been out for a couple of weeks or something?
Sure, Ricky, I'll have it in tomorrow morning's paper.
Good.
Of course in order to get it in at this late notice, I'll, I'll have to make it sound important.
That's all right.
Whatever you have to do, Ross.
Thank you very much.
Da da dee Da ba da Well, I told Ethel you were just kidding.
You knew the date all along, that the party is on.
Good girl!
Come on.
Let's have our breakfast, huh?
Okay.
Ricky?
Yes, darling.
I love you, honey.
I love you, sweetheart.
Mother, do you have anything that should go to the cleaners?
No.
Honestly, the way this stuff piles up.
Well, you certainly made the headlines.
What do you mean?
Well, it's right here on the movie page.
It tells all about the anniversary party Mickey's giving for you at the Mocambo tonight.
No kidding.
Mm-hmm.
Listen.
"Ricky Ricardo" Hmm, how do you like that?
They spelled Mickey's name wrong.
"is hosting a 15th anniversary party "for his wife Lucy at the Mocambo tonight.
"Invitations went out last week "to such notables as Esther Williams and Ben Gage, "Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Wilding, Robert Taylor and Ursula Thiess" For heaven's sake!
All those movie stars coming to my party?
Let me see.
"Van and Evie Johnson, "Cary and Betsy Grant, June Allyson and Dick Powell" Oh, Mother, isn't it exciting?
Oh!
Oh, you great, big wonderful doll, you!
Say, what's all this?
My party at the Mocambo.
It's written up in the paper.
Oh, really?
And to think that I doubted you.
It says right here in the paper that the invitations were sent out last week.
You know, Mickey, in spite of all my predictions, I think you're going to turn out all right.
Thanks.
And, honey, the guest list.
Guest list?
Well, I think almost every star in Hollywood is gonna be there.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Geesh.
I guess Lassie couldn't make it.
Honey, when you first told me about the party, I never dreamed it would be anything like this.
Neither did I. I mean, you know, once I got started, I figured I'd go all the way, you know.
Nothing is too good for my baby and her 15th wedding anniversary.
I'm going right over and tell the Mertzes all about the party, honey.
And I'm going down and get another paper and show it to that snooty Mrs. Anderson.
She thinks her daughter is such a much.
Oh, ha, ha.
Hello.
Hi.
What did you think of that spread in the paper this morning?
Yeah, well, that was wonderful, Ross, but, uh, didn't you overdo it a little?
This thing is liable to cost me a fortune.
How many of those people are coming?
None.
None?
!
No, I just printed the names of the people I knew would be out of town.
Oh.
Wait a minute, boy.
This is worse.
What am I going to tell Lucy?
Uh Thank you very, very much for calling.
Yes, sir, I'll call you.
Good-bye.
They must be out having breakfast or something.
Gee, I can hardly wait to tell Ethel about all the movie stars.
Well, now, honey Oh, here they are.
Ethel!
Don't go too overboard, honey.
You-you never know what might happen.
Ricky, you go over and talk some sense into the Mertzes.
They make me so mad.
What's the matter?
They think they're not invited to my party.
Aw, come now, of course they're invited.
Well, that's what I tried to tell them, but they want to know why they didn't get their invitations last week.
Oh.
Uh I told them they were family.
They weren't expected to get a formal invitation, for heaven's sake.
Good.
I mean, that's true, yeah.
And then they wanted to know why their name wasn't in the paper.
Yeah, well, uh I'll go, I'll go and talk to them.
Sure they're invited.
Mira que quiere decir que no estan invitados.
Ricky!
Yeah?
Just a minute.
What's the meaning of this?
Uh No hablo ingles.
You come back here.
You hablo plenty of ingles and you'd better start "habloing" right now.
Tengo que irme.
Adios, muchacha.
Come back here, or I'll adios your muchacha.
All right.
All right.
I forgot the date.
I admit it.
Is that a crime?
Yes!
Oh, now, honey, now, I-I don't blame you for being a little upset, but aren't you being unreasonable?
No!
Aw, come now, honey.
You forgot the date of our anni if you forgot the date of our anniversary, how could you have sent those invitations out last week?
Yeah, well, uh that's another thing.
Uh There, there, there were no invitations.
None of those peoples are coming.
None of those peoples are coming?
No.
You see, uh that was Ross' idea.
He-he-he thought he would, uh, put it in the paper for publicity.
Publicity!
Now, look, honey, we'll, we'll have our party at the Mocambo.
You and I and the Mertzes will go there You have your party.
I'm not going!
What do you mean?
Just what I said, I'm not going.
Aw, come now, honey, you-you don't mean that you're not going to go to your anniversary party with me?
That's just what I mean.
No, no, you don't mean that.
Don't tell me what I mean!
Now, look, I'm going to start getting mad pretty soon, too, you know.
I'm going to give you your last chance.
Now, are you going to go to your anniversary party with me or not?
No, I am not!
All right.
Then I'll go by myself.
Go ahead.
All right.
All right.
Okay!
Okay!
Okay.
All right!
Yeah!
Happy anniversary to Oh, keep quiet!
What's the matter?
Oh, you're always singing!
Now, Lucy, this is not funny anymore.
Now, for the last time, are you going to go to your anniversary party with me or not?
What am I supposed to do with these?
I'll be right with you.
Now, look, Lucy, the Mertzes and I are going to the Mocambo.
It is your anniversary party.
We would love to have you with us.
Gin.
All right.
I'm going to tell you something.
I'm going to go out of that door and when I go out of that door, I'm not coming back here.
Are you going to let me go?
That does it.
Ooh, he makes me so mad!
Imagine, going nightclubbing on his anniversary while he leaves his poor wife sitting home alone.
Yeah.
You're not gonna let him get away with it, are you?
I certainly am not.
I'm gonna I'm What do you mean, I'm not gonna let him get away with it?
It's your anniversary just as much as it is his.
Call the Mocambo, reserve a table and have your own anniversary party.
Well, that won't be much fun just sitting there alone.
Look at it this way.
With you there, it will completely louse up his evening.
Yeah.
Oh, no, I couldn't go by myself.
Will you go with me?
Sure.
Mrs. Anderson will sit with the baby.
Good.
Uh, yeah.
Maybe we can get a couple of fellas.
What?
How would it look for two women to walk into a nightclub alone?
Oh, that's right.
We'll need an escort.
Well, now, let's see, who do we know?
Come in!

{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Hi.
Hi, girl.
I just saw your mother and Little Ricky on the way to the park again.
Isn't that wonderful?
They can go outside every day in California.
What are you doing?
Writing in my trip diary.
Let's see now.
"Friday, we went to Farmers Market.
Saw Robert Taylor squeezing oranges".
Yeah, some oranges have all the luck.
Wait till the girls back home see the orange I have that Robert Taylor touched.
And you've got his autograph to prove it.
Yeah.
Wasn't he cute when he said he'd never signed an orange before?
Too bad you didn't get him to autograph something more permanent.
You'll have to throw that orange away eventually.
Never.
That orange and I are going to grow old and wrinkled together.
How many movie stars does that make we've seen?
Well, let's see now.
I got them all right back here.
Eighty-four Ninety-nine!
We just need one more to make a hundred.
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Hi, Rick.
Hey, Lucy.
Listen to this item in Sheila Graham's column.
"A well-known star has been ordered by the doctor "to get away from it all "and has taken a room at one of our local hotels.
"I wouldn't give away the secret hiding place, but the hotel's first name is Beverly".
Beverly!
I'll bet that movie star's hiding right here at the Beverly Palms.
Or the Beverly Hills Hotel Let's see now.
Well-known star.
I wonder who it is.
I just got to find out.
Why is it such a matter of life and death?
Because we've already found 99 movie stars since we came to Hollywood.
We need one more to make an even hundred.
Oh, hi, Bobby.
Hi, Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, Mr. Ricardo, I brought up the trade papers.
You got a mention today.
Variety, page eight, column three.
I circled it.
Thank you.
Well, I'll say that's real service.
Oh, I'm always looking for items about guests here in the hotel.
Oh, say Bobby, I'll bet you'd know.
What's that?
About that item in Sheila Graham's column.
Is some movie star hiding out in this hotel?
Um, um I don't know anything about it.
Not much you don't.
No, honest, I haven't the slightest idea who's up in the penthouse.
The penthouse!
I was right.
Who is it, Bobby?
Who is it?
No, no, I've said too much already.
Aw, come on now, Bobby.
All we want to know is, is it a man or woman?
Aw, come on, Bobby.
You can trust us.
We're your friends.
Yeah.
Come on.
All we want to know is, is it a man or a woman?
Now, the manager's not allowed us to discuss him.
Then it's a man!
What's his name?
Bobby, what's his name?
Oh, come on, Bobby.
Mr. Ricardo, help!
All right.
All right, girls.
Help!
All right, girls.
Lay off of him.
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
Yeah!
All we want to know is the name.
For heaven's sake, what's wrong with that?
Don't you tell them anything that you're not supposed to.
I won't.
Come on, I'll convoy you to the door.
Thank you, Mr. Ricardo.
If anybody finds out that Cornel Wilde is Cornel Wilde!
Right here in our hotel.
Yeah!
Oh, well, I can always get a job at the new Beverly Hilton.
Oh, don't worry, Bobby, your secret's safe with us.
Sure, sure.
Yeah, I bet.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Bobby.
Cornel Wilde, right up there in that penthouse.
Boy!
All we have to do now is figure out how to get a look at him.
Wup-up-up-up-up.
What are you wup-up-upping about?
Now, we're gonna nip this thing in the bud right now.
Cornel Wilde came here to get away from people, remember?
I don't want to bother him.
All I want to do is see him.
Oh well, that I can arrange.
You can?
Sure.
Oh, you know him from the studio.
Will you really arrange so I can see him?
Sure.
Tonight we'll go see his new picture The Big Combo.
Got wonderful reviews.
Oh you know what I mean.
I want to see him up close.
All right, we'll sit in the front row.
Oh, Ricky, now, you can't do this to me.
One of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood is right over my head, under my nose.
Now, look, Lucy, I've got a message for you.
Well, slip it under the door.
I'll read it later.
I'm telling you, I want you to forget that he's up there.
Forget it?
But Ricky, why should But Yeah, but Hi.
What are you doing?
Trying to hear Cornel Wilde up there.
Oh, any luck?
No.
If he's walking around, he's wearing bunny fur scuffies.
I got another idea cooking, though.
I'll bet you have.
I told Bobby to bring some ice water up here.
When he gets up here, Lucy I'm going to ask him if he could possibly Lucy tell me just when Lucille!
he goes in and out What?
!
I hate to point this out, but Ricky told you to just forget that Cornel Wilde is up there.
Well, for once in my life, I'm not gonna do what Ricky tells me.
For once in your life!
?
You never do what he tells you.
So why spoil a perfect record?
Oh, I can't keep up with you.
Here's your ice water.
Won't you bring it in, Bobby?
Would you set it on the coffee table, please?
Bobby Miss Ricardo, I'm pretty busy.
Bobby, I just want to ask a little favor of you.
The answer is no.
Bobby, all I want to know is when he goes in or out so I can take a little peek at him.
He doesn't come in; he doesn't go out.
He just stays there.
Oh Look, please let me go.
I got to take this up to you-know-who right now.
Why don't you give up, Lucy?
Because I just got to see him.
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Ricardo, but the only person who's allowed in to see him is me.
Now, he came here for a rest.
And the manager says if there are any calls from.
that I am to Oh, no!
Not that!
Let me borrow your outfit, Bobby.
Absolutely not!
Bobby, all I want to do is take the paper up, rap on the door.
When he opens the door, I'll hand him the paper and I'll take a little look and I'll slam the door and he'll never know the difference.
Absolutely impossible.
Bobby Bobby, I'd hate to have to tell the manager that you were the one who blabbed all over town that Cornel Wilde was there.
You wouldn't!
Oh, wouldn't I?
: Bobby told everybody that Cornel Wilde was in the penthouse!
Mrs. Ricardo Cornel Wilde!
Corn Mrs. Ricardo please!
Gosh!
How can anybody look so pretty on the outside and be so sneaky on the inside?
Isn't it awful?
It's like smelling a rose, getting stung by a bee.
Bobby, let me borrow your outfit.
No, ma'am.
Bobby.
No, Mrs Bobby.
Mrs. Ricardo, please!
Turn around, fire Be quick on the draw Or else one shot, there ain't no more    Come on in!
The door's open.
Bellboy.
Come in.
Bobby?
Yes, sir?
Oh, you got the paper?
Yes, sir.
Oh, good.
Well, uh, bring it in.
I want to have something to read in the bathtub.
Come on, Bobby, let's have it.
What's the matter with you?
I can't reach it from the bathtub.
Bring it in.
Hey!
Come in!
Mrs. Ricardo?
Yeah, Bobby?
Oh, here's your broom.
Oh.
Thanks.
I need it for an extension.
This thing doesn't reach far enough for me to see him.
Thanks.
Uh, Mrs. Ricardo Huh?
Could I ask you something?
Sure.
Why do you hate me?
I don't hate you.
Then why are you trying to get me fired?
Mr. Wilde doesn't like his newspaper wet.
I am not trying to get you fired, Bobby.
It's just that I want to see him.
Well, just keep me out of it.
Whose lunch is that?
Uh, nobody's.
Bobby Honestly, honestly, it's a practice meal.
I'm gonna eat it myself.
Come on in.
Mr. Wilde, I brought up your lunch and a fresh newspaper.
That's good.
This one's so wet, you can read one page right through the other.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry about that.
For a minute I thought President Eisenhower was playing golf with Little Orphan Annie.
Uh, where would you like the table set, sir?
Oh, I guess over here's fine.
All right.
There we are.
Oh, uh, anything else, sir?
Uh, oh, no, thank you.
I'll just sign that now.
Yes, sir.
I put your tip on there too, Bobby.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Come in.
Uh, Mr. Wilde, you, uh, finished with your lunch?
Yep.
All set, thank you.
Okay.
All right.
Ow!
What's the matter, Bobby?
Oh, sometimes the wheels stick and you sort of get it in the shin.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry, sir, I'm very clumsy today.
Bobby.
Yes, sir.
I seem to be all out of ink.
Do you know where there's any more around here?
Oh, there should be some in the desk.
Let's see.
There you are, sir.
Oh, thank you very much.
Uh-huh.
Anything else?
No, fine.
That's all.
Thank you.
Okay, sir.
Now, what's the matter?
Oh The wheels seem to be caught on the furniture.
I'll, I'll fix it, sir.
Ouch!
That hurt.
Well, I meant it to!
Bobby!
Now, what's going on?
Uh, well uh, nothing, sir.
Nothing.
I I'm just talking to myself.
I do it all the time.
My mother worries about me.
Yeah, but I I heard two different voices.
Well, there couldn't have been two voices when I'm the only one here, see?
Oh, I get it.
Well, I never expected it of you, Bobby.
What?
Trying to audition.
Well, I guess everybody wants into show business.
Where did you ever learn ventriloquism?
Ventriloquism?
Why, I don't know the Oh, ventriloquism!
Oh, yeah.
Well, I don't do it very well.
Oh, what I heard sounded darn good.
Sounded just like a voice coming from under the cart.
Well, that's not too hard.
Do it again.
No, I'd rather not.
Oh, come on.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Go ahead, Bobby, do it again.
Bobby, that's absolutely marvelous.
I didn't even see your lips move.
Well, it takes practice.
Yeah, I've got to go now.
Oh, no, don't go.
Do some more.
No, don't go, Bobby.
Do some more.
Ah, I saw your lips move that time.
Well, I've really got to go now.
Go ahead and go, but leave me here.
Bobby, that's, that's fantastic.
You're the best ventriloquist I've ever seen.
Thank you.
Warm.
Uh, can I have a sip of your water?
Oh, sure.
Go ahead.
When Irish eyes are smiling Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay Well, Bobby, wonderful.
Absolutely wonderful.
Bobby, I'm gonna call my agent and tell him about you.
Well, I wouldn't want you to go to too much trouble.
It's no trouble at all.
I'll be doing him a favor.
You're sensational.
Well, if he is interested, he could call me here at the, at the hotel.
Okay, I'll have him call you here.
Okay, thank you, sir.
Hey, Bobby.
Yes, sir?
Just do that little voice for me once more, will you?
Okay.
We have to go now.
Say good-bye.
: Bye.
We have to go now.
Bobby, it's absolutely incredible.
I-I could have sworn your voice was coming from behind the couch.
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
I've got to hand it to you, Bobby.
I'm certainly gonna tell my agent.
Yeah, well, well, thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, wonderful.
Uh, I won't forget to tell him, Bobby.
No, no, I thank you.
I know.
Well, good-bye.
Bye.
Lucy?
Lucy?
LUCY : Ethel?
Ethel, are you down there?
Lucy?
Where are you?
I'm up here.
What are you doing up there?
!
Shh!
I'm locked out on the balcony.
Locked out on the balcony?
Shh!
Be quiet.
I'll explain later.
Is Ricky there?
No.
Good.
I want you to help me down.
Help you down?
Yeah.
I figured a way to lower myself over the side and I want you to pull me in when I go by.
I won't do it.
It's a long ways down there.
You might fall.
Never mind that.
Now, do as I say.
I need some scissors.
Put it on the end of that broom.
What broom?
It's over by the coffee table.
Where are the scissors?
In that desk.
The broom Shoot.
I ought to be used to this type thing.
Here they come.
Okay.
Here I come.
Honey, I'm home.
Hi, Rick!
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Where's Lucy?
Uh, I don't know.
Oh, she's probably hanging around the hotel somewhere.
You can say that again.
Uh, what's new, Rick?
What's the matter with you, Ethel?
Oh, nothing.
If-if Lucy isn't here, I I'd like to listen to what's happened to you because you've been so nice to me, Ricky.
I wouldn't even be in California if it wasn't for you and your career.
That's true.
Yeah.
: Rick, I Would you like to know about a new cake I've learned how to bake?
You-you take a half a cup of butter for this cake and you cream it.
And then and then you Ethel!
Oh, then you add the frosting!
What's the matter with you, Ethel?
Are you crazy or something?
No, no, no.
Well, I got to go now.
I hate to eat and run.
We didn't eat.
Well, some other time.
Where are you going?
Oh, I got to pick up a friend.
I'm telling you.
Hmm.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Cornel.
Yeah.
I thought you were hiding out.
Sure.
I'd love to play some gin.
Okay.
I'll come up.
Okay.
Oh!
Oh, Lucy, you're here!
Oh, thank goodness.
I've been looking all over the grounds for you.
Are you all right?
Oh, poor little thing.
What broke your fall?
One of the most uncomfortable palm trees in California.
Well, bless its little heart.
Yeah.
Well   Hello?
Hi, honey.
This is Ricky.
Oh, hi.
Hey, Ricky?
Just a minute.
You want some cream in your coffee?
No, just black.
All right.
Listen, honey, I'm up in Cornel Wilde's apartment.
You're what?
I'm up in Cornel Wilde's apartment and I want you to come up and meet him.
Are you sure this is Ricky?
Yes, honey.
You see, you were so nice about about not bothering him that I want to give you a reward.
Oh.
Now, you see how well things work out when you do what I tell you?
Yes, sir.
Well, you want to come up?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I Yes, sir.
Uh, uh I'll be right up as soon as I powder my nose.
Bye.
What happened?
Ricky's with Cornel Wilde and he wants me to come up.
At last you're gonna get to meet him face-to-face!
Finally.
You want to come with me?
Can I?
Sure.
H-H-Help me g-g-get de-palmed, will you?
Okay.
Do I look all right?
Oh, you look wonderful.
Hey, what took you so long?
Oh, well, I I had to to change my clothes, but I'm ready now.
Come on.
It's too late now.
He's gone.
Gone?
Where?
He moved to another hotel.
Why?
I don't know.
I guess the news of him being here leaked out.
We just found evidence of a prowler in his balcony.
Ew.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
You want coffee, don't you, Fred?
Okay.
Yes?
Good.
You can take care of us, huh?
Oh, that's wonderful.
Thank you very much.
Good-bye.
Is it all set, honey?
Yes, sir, by Wednesday, we'll be lolling in the Palm Springs sun.
Oh, great.
Oh!
Palm Springs.
Oh, that'll be great.
Play golf and everything, huh, Fred?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Lucy, are there Huh?
any of those cakes left that we bought at the Farmers Market?
Oh, gee, I don't know, Ethel.
I'll see if Ethel, we've just had dinner.
Are you gonna feed your face again?
Well, I just want a little extra something.
From where I'm sitting, you've already got that little extra something.
Here they are.
What are we gonna do tonight?
I'd like to go to a movie.
Well, let's see.
Look up something good now, Lucy.
Rock Hudson!
In what?
In Palm Springs.
Are you looking up a movie?
No, I'm reading Hedda Hopper.
She says Rock Hudson has returned from a personal appearance tour with his exciting new picture, Captain Lightfoot, and he's resting in Palm Springs.
That's right.
He told me at lunch the other day he was going down there.
Do you know him?
Here he is hobnobbing with big celebrities every day.
It just doesn't mean a thing to him.
Honey, they're just like anybody else.
"They're just like anybody else".
Oh Oh See if you can find a neighborhood movie.
All right.
What's so funny?
What's so funny?
!
Well, it seems they arrested a woman last night for hitting her husband.
I fail to see anything comical about that.
Well it was the way it happened.
They were married for 20 years.
He had this irritating habit of cracking his knuckles.
Finally she couldn't stand it and she said, "Don't crack your knuckles anymore, dear.
Let me do it".
And she cracked them with a baseball bat!
Well, they  I've often Well, they've finally crossed that thin dividing line.
I don't see why you have to get so hysterical about it.
I don't know, but the idea of someone finally letting go and doing exactly as they've wanted to do for 20 years just kills me.
I know just how she felt.
Yeah, imagine with a baseball bat.
Pow!
A baseball bat.
Well, she couldn't have loved her husband very much, my goodness, if a little knuckle cracking is all she had to put up with.
What do you mean by that, Lucy?
What?
"If a little knuckle cracking is all she had to put up with".
Oh, I didn't mean anything, dear.
Everybody has little habits that annoy somebody else.
Are you insinuating that I have habits that drive you crazy?
Honey, I didn't say that you had any annoying habits that drive me crazy.
What do you mean by that?
Oh, honey, now, you're only human.
All right, go ahead.
Mention one annoying habit that I have.
Go on.
Mention one.
Well, if you insist.
That tapping.
What tapping?
That tapping.
Oh, well.
Huh.
I never did that before.
Never did it bef Oh, honey!
You've been tapping those nervous little fingers for 15 years.
Well, I beg your pardon.
Oh, honey, now, don't let it upset you.
Nowadays it doesn't bother me much, but I will admit it used to set my teeth on edge.
Muchas gracias.
Well, are we going to a movie or aren't we?
Yeah, see what's playing around here, Ethel.
Look in the paper, will you?
Okay.
At the Pantages is, uh May I say that you're not the only one that has the tith on edge.
Oh?
Go on.
What is it about me that sets your "tith" on edge?
No, no, go ahead, tell me what little habit I have that drives you crazy.
Ha, you know what it is.
No, I don't.
You're doing it right now.
I'm not doing anything now.
Is your coffee too hot?
No.
Then why are you stirring it?
Every morning for hours and hours and hours.
Tickily tink, tickily tink, tickily tink.
Tickily tink, tickily tink.
Well, that's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard.
I'm just stirring it enough to get the cream mixed in.
: "Get the cream mixed in".
You stir it long enough to make butter.
Why, breakfast wouldn't be breakfast without you pounding out "the anvil chorus" on your coffee cup.
Well, I'm very sorry that I set your tith on edge.
And that's another thing.
You're always mucking the way I talk.
That's because there's so much there to "muck".
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Well Now wait a minute.
Wait a minute, will you?
Take it easy.
You're acting like that couple in the paper.
Are we going to a picture or not?
Not.
Oh, now, you're just acting childish.
Married people are only human.
You just have to learn to overlook these little things.
Sure.
Imagine if I let Ethel's irritating habits get on my nerves.
What irritating habits are you referring to, Frederick?
It's nothing.
You just said we'd have to overlook these things.
What things?
Oh, now, let's not be specific, honeybunch.
You'd only get sore.
No, I wouldn't, dear.
Go on, tell me.
Well, here's a little thing.
You enjoy your food so much, you eat it with a lot of Gusto?
Relish?
Enthusiasm?
Well, frankly the word I had in mind was  Noise!
Noise?
!
You, you, you asked me and I told you.
Speaking of noise, I have a compliment for you.
For me?
Well, what is it?
You going to tell me?
Yes, just as soon as you finish that chorus of "Jingle Bells".
"Jingle bells"?
What are you talking about?
: "Jingle bells".
So I jingle my keys a little.
A little!
For 25 years, I felt like I was married to the Good Humor Man!
Well, it certainly is very interesting to find out that we've been driving each other crazy all these years.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes?
Something bothering you?
You are deliberately not stirring your coffee.
I am not.
Yes, you are.
I am not deliberately not stirring my coffee.
No me digas lo que estas haciendo.
Look, let me tell you something.
If you expect to argue with me, will you please argue in English?
How can I answer anything?
Hey, hey, hey.
I just came from the preliminaries.
I'm glad I'm in time for the main event.
Oh, you, too, huh?
Yeah, but, uh, our bout was a little bit dull-- all in English.
No international flavor, like yours.
Well, I don't blame Ethel, Fred.
That was terrible, your telling her she chewed like a cow.
Why, if you ever said a thing like that Oh, now, lay off, will you, Lucy?
I just went ten rounds with Old Bossy.
Aah.
Oh, there you are.
I want the key to the trunk unless you need it to play a tune.
How'd you like to hear a couple of choruses of "Cow Cow Boogie"?
Fred, you take that back!
All right, I'll take that back.
What's the matter with all of us?
We're snapping at each other like four cats in a sack.
We are, aren't we?
Yes, we are, and I know why we're getting on each other's nerves.
Why?
Because we've been together too much on this trip.
Any four people that have spent this much time together are bound to get sick of each other.
Lucy, I think you've hit it.
Yeah.
So the four of us are gonna go to Palm Springs and share a bungalow.
Oh, dear.
Well, there's just one thing to do: One couple go to Palm Springs, the other couple stay here.
Oh, that doesn't seem fair.
Well, it's the only way, Ethel.
We'll tell you all about it when we get back.
Wait a minute.
How come you're the couple that's going?
Yeah.
Oh, I don't know.
I just picked a couple at random and it was us.
No, no, I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll flip a coin.
Heads, the Mertzes will go; tails, we go.
Okay?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
We're going at this thing all wrong.
We're planning to spend the weekend with the person who annoys us the most.
Oh, yeah.
We're paired off wrong.
Now she tells me.
All right, so who's gonna go to Palm Springs?
Either Ethel and I, or Fred and you.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Shall I flip the coin?
All right, heads, we go; tails, you stay.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You won't catch me with that again.
That's how I happened to get married.
Oh So I made a mistake.
Uh, heads, we go; tails, you go.
That's better.
All right?
Okay.
Two out of three.
Lucy Three out of five.
Four out of seven.
All right, all right.
You and Ethel go to Palm Springs.
Have a good time.
You mean it?
It's either that or 223 out of 349.
It says here this is the first time it's rained in Palm Springs during this month in 20 years.
No kidding.
Well, leave it to us to pick this time.
Any break in the clouds?
Huh?
Any break in the clouds?
Oh, I wasn't looking at that.
I thought maybe a movie star would float by.
You know, the waiter told me this morning that Rock Hudson's staying in that bungalow next door.
"Palm Springs-- where the sunshine spends the winter".
Where's the sun?
Maybe it couldn't get a room.
Well, I'm going in and take a nap with the baby.
Okay, Mother.
I wonder what the boys are doing in Hollywood.
Oh, they're probably down at the pool swimming and sunning.
And jingling and tapping.
Jelly.
Do you want some more coffee?
Nope.
Oh!
Cherry.
Mmm Mmm  Whoa-ho-ho-ho!
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Ethel, will you stop it?
!
I can't stand it another minute!
Stand what?
What was I doing?
What's the matter with you?
Can't you eat quietly?
You sound like a cow pulling its foot out of the mud.
I am getting a little tired of being called a cow.
Well, do you have to make so much noise?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I have to do something to drown out the sound of your clinking.
I'm going stir-crazy.
Well, I beg your pardon.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ethel.
I guess my nerves are on edge.
I wish we hadn't come on this trip at all.
I miss Ricky.
I can top that.
I miss Fred.
I wish they were down here right now, taps, clinks and all.
So do I. Well, let's call them up and tell them to come down right away, huh?
Okay!
Oh, wait a minute.
You can't do that.
Why not?
Well, if you call them up, it'll be just admitting that we were wrong and that we miss them.
Well, we were wrong, and we do miss them.
You can't tell a husband a thing like that!
You'll set wives back 2,000 years.
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm ready to forgive and forget.
You forgive and they'll never let you forget.
Well, how else are we gonna get them down here?
Oh, there must be another way.
We can think of something.
Is it ever gonna stop raining?
Aw, what's the difference?
The ball game's called off.
Nuts!
Just when I had a chance to see the Hollywood stars.
Well, we can't play golf and we can't go swimming.
What are we gonna do?
Well, if this rain keeps coming down, we might as well start building an ark.
Well, we got to do something besides just sit in this room.
Well, we can always go and sit in my room.
Very clever remark.
Heh, heh, heh, heh.
I liked it.
Do you have to jingle those keys?
!
Will you stop that tapping?
!
You know, the way we're snapping at each other, you'd think we were married.
Yeah.
You know what I think it is?
What?
Well, this might sound crazy to you, but I think we miss our wives.
Oh, come now.
No, really.
I miss Lucy.
You don't suppose I miss Ethel?
Why else would you be acting so cranky and irritable?
Well, my liver could be out of whack.
Come on!
Let's go join them.
Let's get out of this miserable rain and into that wonderful Palm Springs sunshine.
We gotta have a story.
We just can't run down there there and say we miss 'em.
Well  Get that.
Hello.
Palm Springs.
Maybe the girls.
Hello?
Uh-uh.
Yes, this is Ricky Ricardo.
Oh, yes.
Yes Oh, ye sure.
I could come I could leave right away.
Okay.
Thank you.
That would be wonderful.
This is perfect.
That was Dore Schary's secretary.
She wants me to come to Palm Springs and meet with Dore for a picture.
Gee, what a break!
Isn't that great?
Great.
Go pack your bags.
Oh, boy!
What a recipe for chocolate cake.
Oh, Ethel, you're always thinking about something to eat.
MRS.
McGILLICUDDY: Come on, baby.
On to Mom, darling.
Here we are!
Hi!
Hi, sweetie!
Ah, we had a nice long walk.
Now we're going to go in and get a cookie.
All right, honey.
But don't let him eat too much.
I don't want him to spoil his dinner.
All right.
Come on, now.
Come on, we walk back.
There we go.
Bye, lovey.
Say bye-bye to Mom.
Oh, isn't this wonderful?
Oh, thank goodness that sun came out.
Why are you all covered up?
You know I don't want to get sunburn.
I don't get it.
What was all that talk about "Where's the sun"?
Well, it's the principle of the thing.
I paid for the sun.
It's my business whether I use it or not.
Lucy!
: Rock Hudson!
Pardon me.
Aren't you Mrs. Ricky Ricardo?
Y-Yes.
I mean, yes.
Well, I'm Rock Hudson.
: Oh, ye well, I know that.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Uh, uh, this is Mrs Mrs., um, uh Mertz.
Mertz?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Uh, Mrs. Mertz.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Did Ricky come with you?
Uh, no, no.
He couldn't get away.
Oh, that's too bad.
You mind if I join you?
Oh, why, certainly we don't mind.
Oh, no!
Uh, um, uh Would you like a piece of rock, Mr. Candy?
Oh I know, of course.
No, thank you.
I, uh, just got some bad news about somebody Ricky knows.
Oh?
Script girl at the studio, and I wanted to tell him about it.
Oh, well, uh w-w-wouldn't you like to tell me?
I'll tell him.
Well, I would like to talk to somebody about it.
if you wouldn't mind.
Oh, no.
Go right ahead.
Well, this script girl, Adele Sliff Adele Sliff?
Mm-hmm.
Wonderful girl.
She's been married for 20 years.
Hmm.
About three weeks ago, she and her husband had their first fight.
Oh.
What did they fight about?
A habit he had.
A habit?
A silly little habit.
Hmm.
What was it?
He whistled all the time.
He whistled?
Absentmindedly, like this:  Like that?
Just the one note, all the time.
Well!
That would drive anyone crazy.
Yeah!
Sam would  all day and  all night and finally Adele couldn't stand it any longer and she said, "Sam, just one more  and I'll leave you".
And?
And he , and she did.
She did?
She left him?
She left him.
Just because he went ?
Oh, well, they'll probably go back together.
Yeah.
If you really love someone, you shouldn't let a little  come between you.
That's the sad part of it.
Yesterday, Adele got a wire.
And it said Well, it said What, Mr. Hudson?
Well, you see, Sam was on his way home to try to make up with her, and he had an accident.
Adele flew to the hospital and went into his room and there was Sam, wrapped in bandages from head to foot.
Adele said, Oh "Sam, speak to me.
Just one little ".
All she wanted to hear was just one little ?
Did he?
No.
It was all over.
No ?
No .
Sam will never  again.
Oh!
Quite a sad story.
It certainly is.
Wasn't that awful?
It shows you how one little mistake can mess up your whole life.
Yeah.
Oh, dear.
Well, Fred!
Look who's here!
Hi!
Oh, Fred!
Hey, Ricky!
Oh, honey, I missed you so!
Well, we missed you, too, honey.
Oh, baby.
Wait a minute.
Oh, you were great, man.
What's so funny?
You should win an award for that performance!
What are you talking about?
I got to tell them.
It's so great that I got to tell them.
What?
You see, we didn't know how you would feel about us, so we asked Rock to come over here and kind of soften you up.
Oh, really!
Well, Ethel, what's the difference?
The important thing is, we're all together.
You're not angry, are you?
Oh, I should say not.
You can soften me up any time.
Well, Ricky, I got to go.
I'll see you later.
Okay, Rock.
Oh, listen.
You know what bungalow Dore Schary's staying in?
Dore Schary?
Yeah.
He's not here.
He's not?
No.
I can't understand that.
His secretary called me on the phone "Would you mind coming down to Palm Springs?
"Mr. Schary would like to discuss a picture property with you".
Was that you on the phone!
?
Oh, you  I'll bet you think we're crazy, huh?
Well yes.
Yeah, well, we are.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know all about it, but there is nothing that I can do.
Oh, Ricky, you don't understand what this means to me.
I understand perfectly.
You do not or you couldn't just stand there and see me suffer like this.
If Caroline Appleby comes here this afternoon and I don't have some movie stars here to meet her, my name is mud.
Well, it's all your fault.
You wrote her all those letters, telling here that you were hobnobbing with movie stars.
Now she's in town and you can't produce them.
So why did you have to write all those bragging letters?
It was perfectly legitimate.
It made my letters more interesting, more readable.
The awful thing is, Caroline sneaking into town like this.
Sneaking into town?
She's on her way to Hawaii.
Yeah, well, she planned this whole trip just to show me up.
Well, I'm sorry.
You're always telling people stories that are not true.
I'm going to the pool.
Just a minute.
Yes?
Ricky, I'm not asking for much.
All I want is a half a dozen movie stars for a couple of hours.
Now, if you can't do this simple little thing for me, I'll I'll kill myself.
Kill yourself?
Yes.
Well, you got a lovely day for it.
Oh!
Hi.
I just saw Ricky leave.
Any luck?
No.
How would Harpo Marx be?
Wonderful!
Get him!
Wait a minute.
I didn't say I could get him.
Oh, fine.
Now, he's appearing at a luncheon here today at the hotel, and maybe we could get him to drop by.
Oh, sure, maybe we could get Princess Margaret to fly over for tea.
You never know unless you ask.
Well, all right.
You run and ask Harpo, I'll call Princess Margaret.
Okay.
Oh It just doesn't make sense, Ethel.
Why should he want to do us a favor?
He doesn't even know us.
I guess you're right.
Well, all we can hope is that Caroline loses her glasses again and can't find the hotel.
Hey, wait a minute!
What?
Caroline can't see a foot in front of her face without her glasses, can she?
No.
What if we could get her glasses away from her?
And?
What are you doing?
I was just trying to see if I was real nearsighted, if maybe you couldn't pass for Marilyn Monroe.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Pull your hair down over one eye.
Now walk like Marilyn.
Oh, no, nobody's that nearsighted.
Thanks a lot.
Hey, that magic shop up on the boulevard sells masks that look like movie stars.
Maybe if you wore a mask I am not wearing any hot rubber mask all afternoon.
All right, then I will.
Oh, you can't get away with wearing a mask.
I could if I got her glasses off her.
And how are you gonna do that?
Well, let's see, uh When Caroline comes in, uh : Oh, hi, Caroline.
Oh I'm terribly sorry.
Or, uh Oh, Lucy, why don't you just shoot her when she walks through the door?
Then you won't have to bother about getting the masks.
Well, come on, we'll go get the masks right away.
We can figure out how to get her glasses off later, huh?
Oh Hi.
Caroline isn't here yet, huh?
No.
Listen, you didn't lock your door, did you?
No.
I got the door all open and I got your mother to take the baby to the zoo for the afternoon and I got your costumes all laid out on the bed just waiting for you to get in 'em.
Okay.
Now, the important thing for you to remember is that you have to keep Caroline real busy while I'm changing from one outfit to the other.
I know.
Now, let's see.
When I got the Harpo Marx outfit on, I don't have to talk, so I don't have to worry about that.
Now, when I've got the other  There she is.
Well Hi, Lucy, how are ya?
Hi, Ethel!
Any stars here yet?
Oh, no, not yet, dear.
Oh, I can just hardly wait.
Who do you suppose will come by?
Well, like I told you-- Clark, Bing and Gary will be here and, uh, Ronnie and Bonita will Oh, no.
No, Ronnie and Bonita were here last week.
They probably won't drop in again this week.
Oh.
Uh, but Harpo Marx is staying in the hotel.
He said he might come up.
Oh, he's one of my favorite funny men.
Well, good, and you never can tell who else might drop in.
Caroline, your glasses are all smudged.
I want you to be able to see the movie stars real good.
You'd better let me clean them for you.
What's that?
Isn't that a wonderful idea?
I bought it when I lost my glasses.
That will never happen to me again.
No, these are clear.
I can see real good.
Oh, chocolates, mmm.
Caroline, dear Yeah.
Uh, just how bad are your eyes without your glasses?
: Oh, are you kidding, Lucy?
I can't see a thing.
Oh, come now.
No, really, I can't.
Oh, I don't believe that.
Well Well, take them off.
Let me test you.
Well, all right, but you'll see.
I just can't see a thing.
Oh, I don't believe it.
What does that say?
Uh oh, I can't see that.
Yeah, well, try.
Come on, try.
Uh well No, I can't make that out.
Oh, my Oh, you're really blind, girl.
I told you, oh, it's awful.
Why, that I don't believe, for heaven's sake.
You know, I heard people say that they couldn't see without their glasses letters this high, you know.
What's the matter, dear, lose something?
Well, my glasses-- th-they're gone.
Why, they couldn't be.
They're hanging right around your Well, for heaven's sake, they are gone.
Oh Now, they couldn't have just disappeared.
Oh, they must be here someplace.
Ah, you kids look for the glasses.
I got a lot to do before the gang gets here.
I got to go next door and borrow some sugar.
Borrow sugar?
In a hotel?
Oh, well, we're just all one big happy family here.
Oh.
I just don't understand it.
They, they couldn't have simply disappeared into thin air.
Oh, I'm so sorry, honey.
: Ethel, you suppose that's a movie star?
I have a feeling it might be.
Come in.
Why, Gary.
Who is it?
Who is it?
It's Gary Cooper.
Oh!
Hi, Gary.
Howdy.
I want you to meet a friend of mine, Caroline Appleby.
Oh, how do you do?
Howdy, ma'am.

Too bad he couldn't stay.
You'd have loved him.
Gee, he looked so handsome, too.
From what I could see.
Gee, Gary Cooper.
Oh, Ethel, where are those glasses?
We met a lot of stars since we came to Hollywood.
You did?
Here's another one.
Come in.
Why, Clark!
Who?
Who?
It's Clark Gable.
Oh!
Uh, Clark, can you stay for a little while?
Aw, you got a cold?

That's too bad.
But I want you to meet a friend of mine, Caroline Appleby.
How do you do?
Uh, bup-bup.
You'll catch his cold.
Well, who cares?
Imagine me being able to tell the girls back home that I caught a cold from Clark Gable!
Honey, I'm not going to let you catch a cold Now, Ethel, I want to meet Now look what you did, you scared him.
Well, I'm sorry.
I I guess I was awfully rude, but I just couldn't help myself.
Weren't you excited?
Yeah.
Clark Gable Hi.
Ha, ha!
Lucy, where have you been?
Do you know that Clark Gable and Gary Cooper have been here?
Yeah, I saw them down the hall, and they both thought you were terribly attractive.
Ha, ha!
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Clark said he'd never forgive himself for having that terrible cold.
Oh!
He thought you were a doll.
I'll be back.
Hi, Rick.
Swell day, huh?
Oh, hi, Fred.
You know, Fred, I'm beginning to feel like a heel.
What about?
Well, you know, the way I acted with Lucy today.
I could have got a couple of actors to come over there and visit.
Caroline would have been happy, Lucy would have been happy, and everything would have been all right.
I know she exaggerates, and she shouldn't tell all those stories, but, uh she has a good side to her.
Don't you think so, Fred?
Huh?
Come on, you haven't listened to a word I said.
I was telling you the way that I felt about Lucy   Harpo!
Harpo Marx!

The girls love it.
The girls would have loved to see it.
Hey, would you do me a favor?
Huh?
: No.

Let me tell you what it is.
Lucy has a girlfriend of hers here from New York, see?
And this girl is just dying to meet a big movie star.
Big star like you.
Yeah!
That's right.
So, listen, Harpo.
Would you do me a favor and-and go up to Room 315 and pay them a visit?
Thank you!
Oh, Ethel Ethel, this has been the most thrilling day.
Imagine meeting Bing Crosby, and Walter Pidgeon and Clark Gable and Gary Cooper all in the same day!
Do you think anyone else will drop by?
Oh, I have a feeling someone will.
There's one now.
Come in.
Hiya, folks.
Jimmy Durante!
In person.
Jimmy, I want you to meet a friend of mine and Lucy's, Caroline Appleby.
Oh, how do you do?

Good night, Mrs. Appleby, whoever you are.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, thanks a lot!
Come back again.
Oh, Ethel, Ethel, this has been such fun.
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
Well, it is kind of fun meeting the movie stars and palling around with celebrities.
That must be another one.
Oh, uh I doubt it, so soon.
Why?
Uh, why?
Uh, well, uh, uh, movie stars usually space themselves farther apart than this.
But I'll see.
That was fast.
Uh, Harpo, I want you to meet my friend, Caroline Appleby.
Harpo Marx, how do you do?
Oh!
Don't overdo it.
You know, Harpo, I've seen you chase girls in movies, but you don't really do that, do you?
Did you bring your harp?
No, he didn't.
You did?
You brought your harp?
That man is just a scream.
I laughed so hard, I cried.
Oh, I've got to fix my mascara.
I'll fix my face before he gets back.
Yeah, fix your face.
Where's your harp?
Huh?
Where's Caroline?
She's in there.
Lucy?
What?
Weren't you just here as Harpo?
No.
You weren't?
No.
Then that Harpo really was Harpo!
What are you talking about?
The real Harpo Marx was just here.
What would he be doing up here?
I don't know, but he said he was going to go get his harp.
There he is!
Go hide.
Not in there.
Caroline's in there.
Hide in the kitchen.
In the kitchen.
What?
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
Well, this is a real treat.
Sit down.
He's gonna really play the harp for us.
What are you gonna play?
"Take Me Out To The Ball Game".
Oh!
Oh, Harpo!
Oh, my, that was wonderful.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, I can't believe I was  Oh, wonderful!
That was such a thrill, Harpo.
Oh!
Oh, Harpo, thank you so much.
Oh, thank you, thank you, tha Oh!
Oh!
Oh, my goodness.
It's getting late.
I've got a plane to catch.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it was awfully nice seeing you, Harpo.
And thanks so much, Ethel, for every Oh!
I'll see you to the elevator.
Yes, and be sure and thank Lucy for It was just wonderful.
Good-bye.
Oh, Ethel!
Oh, Caroline, here are your glasses.
My glasses, oh!

Oh, thank you!

Really?
You characters are too late.
What do you mean?
What's the matter?
What happened?
Caroline's already gone.
Oh.
Which one of you two is Harpo?
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
Hi.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Where's Lucy?
She went down to get the mail.
Oh, well, I'll wait for her.
Wouldn't she be the one to do something like this?
What's the matter, honey?
Caroline Appleby gets in town today!
What are you so upset about?
It'll be wonderful to see Caroline again.
Sure.
Well, ordinarily it would be, yes, but somehow she's gotten the idea that I'm surrounded by movie stars.
Uh-huh.
Where did she get an idea like that, I'm pretty sure.
Well, maybe in a letter I-I did drop a name here and there.
Like, uh, who, for instance?
Well, uh, I told her that I ate lunch with Clark Gable last week.
Oh, fine.
Now, honey, why would you tell her something like that when you know that it's not true?
It is, too, true.
I had lunch with Clark Gable.
I was at Perino's and Clark was there and and we ate lunch together.
At different tables, but together doesn't necessarily mean Okay, okay, we got it, we got it.
Now, who else, who else did you tell her that you've been palling around with?
Well, uh, let's see-- Gary Cooper and Bing and, oh, yes, I did mention Marlon Brando.
Marlon Brando.
Did you see On The Waterfront?
Wonderful.
He got the Academy Award, you know.
Oh, dear, she says she's going to be here two whole days and wants to meet them all.
What am I gonna do?
Hmm?
You don't even know what I was going to ask you.
Whenever you get that tone in your voice, the answer is no.
Oh Come on, Fred, we're late for our golf date.
Let's go to the club.
Oh, come on now, Ricky.
I'll see you later.
Adios.
Bye.
What am I gonna do?
I know she's probably on her way over here right now and I haven't even got an idea.
You think of something.
Listen, if Einstein can't work out a problem, you don't hand it to Mortimer Snerd.
But, Ethel, I'm desperate.
Well, I never have any good ideas.
Well, think!
Well, Van Johnson was asleep down by the pool a while ago.
Van Johnson?
Yeah.
I'll see if he's still there.
Yes, he's still there.
So?
Well we could go down and carry him up here without waking him up.
And then we could put him on the couch and when Caroline gets here, we'll say he's a friend of ours and he just dropped by to take a nap.
Thank you, Mortimer Snerd.
Well Eesh!
Sheesh!
"Carry him up here without waking him up".
"Just dropped by to take a nap".
Whew!
Hello?
Would you ask her to come up, please?
Thank you.
She's here.
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
Oh, Lucy, this is a tough one.
You know, she'll blab this all over New York.
Yep.
Well, I guess for once she's just gonna have to face the music.
I got it.
From up here, you can't tell whether Van Johnson's asleep or not.
Now, listen, I'm going downstairs and I'm going over by Van, I'm going to sit down and I'm going to pretend to be talking to him.
You'll never know the difference, see.
Now, when-when Caroline comes in, you take her out on the balcony and I'll see her and I'll wave and-and you just tell her I'm down there chatting with one of my movie star friends, see, and then after I wave, I'll come on up.
Oh, that's a great idea!
I'll go down the stairs while she's coming up the elevator.
Give me time now to get out by the pool.
Okay.
Oh, hi, Caroline.
Oh, Lucy!
Oh, how are you?
Fine, dear.
I'm, I'm sorry I'm late, but I-I guess you saw me down by the pool chatting with Van Johnson.
No, she didn't.
What?
Oh, Lucy, I could just die.
I lost my glasses on the plane and I can't see a thing without them.
So you didn't see us?
Well, I saw two redheaded blurs.
Ethel told me it was you and Van Johnson.
Hmm well, that's a shame.
Gee, that means that you didn't see Clark Gable or Walter Pidgeon or Hedy Lamarr.
They were all down by the pool.
They were?
Oh, yes.
Of course they were.
I should have pointed them out to you, Caroline.
Well, it wouldn't have done any good anyway.
You really can't see, huh?
Not a thing.
Oh, they're still there.
Hello, Clark.
Hello, Walter.
Hello, Hedy.
Oh, let's go down and see them up close.
Oh.
Oh, well, good-bye, Clark.
Good-bye, Walter.
Bye, Hedy.
They're off to the races.
Oh Oh, my goodness, Lucy, I certainly am impressed.
Wait till the girls back home hear about this.
Yeah.
Uh, tell me, what's Van Johnson really like?
Oh, he's just wonderful.
Just the greatest.
You know, he's appearing in a nightclub here in the hotel.
Yeah, I know.
I'd love to see a show.
Oh, we see it almost every night.
Oh, yeah, we've seen it 14 times, and does he work.
He rehearses two or three hours every afternoon.
You know, um, Caroline, Van and I have gotten very chummy.
Yes, as a matter of fact, he asked me to, uh, rehearse with him this afternoon.
What?
!
What?
Yeah, and, uh, you know, Caroline, if you promise to be very quiet, I could have Ethel sneak you in the back of the ballroom, and you could watch the rehearsal.
Oh, Lucy, you're a doll!
What time is rehearsal?
Uh, 2:00.
Oh, that's wonderful because I was going to do some shopping this afternoon, but I'll go out and get done now, and then I'll be back.
Oh, where is everything?
Well, bye.
Bye.
Good-bye.
See you two.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Lucy, you had such a fascinating little mind.
I kinda hate to see it go.
What do you mean telling Caroline I could sneak her in the back?
Well, bub-bub-bub-bup.
Now, Ethel, you've seen Van's act as often as I have.
Now, what does his partner look like?
Well, she's tall, she's got red hair And how far can Caroline see without her glasses?
Well, she said she could only see from about here to Oh Your little mind wasn't gone.
It was just catnapping.
Now, look, I'll hide over in your apartment.
When Caroline comes back, you take her down to the ballroom.
She'll see Van's partner, she'll think it's me.
Bring her back up here.
I'll come in, all out of breath, wiping my face with a towel.
Oh, you've done it again, champ.
How could you ever have doubted me?
I was a fool.
Hi, Ethel.
I'm back.
Hi.
What are those?
What?
Those.
Oh, my glasses.
The airline's found them on the plane and sent them over.
Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Uh is, uh, Lucy rehearsing with Van?
Oh, yes.
Well, then, let's go.
Uh, well, uh, uh, well, I think I'll, uh, I want to make a phone call.
I got to tell Fred something.
Oh.
Give me Room 317, please.
Hello.
Hello, Fred?
No, Fred isn't here right now.
This is Ethel, Fred.
Now, what's the matter with you, Ethel?
This is Lucy.
I know that, Fred.
I want to tell you something.
Caroline's here, and we're going downstairs to watch Lucy rehearse with Van Johnson.
Oh, Caroline's there.
That's right, Fred, and, uh, we thought maybe you'd like to go along.
And if you do go along, I want you to be sure and wear your glasses so you can see as good as Caroline can.
Wh-Wh-What my glass Caroline found her glasses?
You guessed it, Fred, old girl uh, boy.
Well, look, uh, uh, stall, stall.
Uh, give me 15 minutes before you bring her down.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know, but I'll think of something.
Okay, Fred.
Good-bye, Fred.
What's new, Caroline?
Uh, is, uh, Fred coming with us?
Fred who?
Oh, uh, oh, that Fred?
No, no, he's not going with us.
He had something he had to do.
Oh, well, then, let's go.
Go?
Oh, uh, down to watch them rehearse, huh?
Yeah.
Well, okay, let's go.
Fred!
Hi, Caroline.
How are you?
I just came over here Oh, bless his little heart!
He came over to kiss me good-bye.
Well, good-bye, Fred.
Good-bye?
Why, I just got home.
Well, we're just leaving.
I want to show her the hotel before we watch them rehearse.
Come on, honey.
Hello, Marco.
Hey, Van.
I was pretty sloppy last night.
We'd better get down to work.
Where's Hazel?
She's not here yet.
That's funny.
She's usually on time.
Let's see what I was doing wrong with that second number.
Take it from the top, Marco.
I'm sorry, but I'm rehearsing.
Yes, sir, I know.
But nobody's allowed in here during rehearsals.
Well, I know, I know, but, uh, well, we don't have much time.
We don't?
Uh, no.
No, you see, it's like this, Mr. Johnson.
Uh my name is Lucy Ricardo and and my husband is Ricky Ricardo and he's in the movies, too, or at least he will be real soon, so we're all showbiz folks and it isn't like it isn't like some stranger coming up to you on the street and asking a favor and, uh, we really don't have much time.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Oh, no, that's impossible.
Now, look, Mr. Johnson, it's like this: I have this friend from New York and I've been writing her from time to time and-and, uh, you know how it is.
I've been, I've been telling her that, uh, well, that I know a lot of movie stars.
You know, anything to brighten up their drab little lives.
Well, this friend of mine from New York is out here and, uh, I told her that I was rehearsing with you this afternoon and she'll be here any minute.
Who's gonna be here any minute?
Caroline Appleby.
Who do you think?
You'll pardon me, madam, but you're talking nutsy cuckoo.
Oh, no, no, Mr. Johnson.
I'm not no, no.
I'm in a terrible jam.
Now, I know this is a lot to ask, but I really do have a friend from New York and she's coming right here to see me rehearse with you.
Please, couldn't I just do a few steps with you?
I'm sorry, that's out of the question.
Oh, please, Mr. Johnson!
Please.
I'll be eternally grateful.
I'll, I'll, I'll go see your next picture three times.
I'll, I'll name my next child after you if I have one.
If I don't, I'll, I'll, I'll change the name of the one I already have.
Please?
Will you please get up?
I understand your problem and I'd like to help you Oh, thank you!
Thank you!
But I can't.
Oh, Mr. Johnson Please?
Caroline will blab it all over New York.
Please say that I can do it.
Please say you'll help me.
Look, even if I say I would, uh uh you don't know any of my routines and I don't have the time to Oh, oh, but I do.
I've seen your show 14 times.
Really?
Yeah.
Yes, I-I-I know how your, how your partner makes the entrance.
Look, I'll show you.
See, she comes in here and you go Da da da dee dee dee Da da da And then she waits for you to sing and I even know the patter in between that she sings in the song.
No.
The little things that she says in between.
Well, I'll be Yeah, well, can I do it, then?
Well Oh, please?
I'll do it.
Oh, thank you.

Hello.
Sit down, Ethel.
Sit down.
Now, uh, let's just get on with the rehearsal.
They won't bother us.
Oh, uh, Lucy, Yes?
I'm not sure about that next routine.
You may have to tell me how it goes again.
You're not sure?
Uh Oh.
Well, we-we-we come in, make the entrance, you know, from both sides and then we just all together.
That's it, that's it.
Thank you.

Well, now you're talking, boy.
Oh, Lucy, this has been an afternoon I will never forget.
Oh, it was nothing.
Oh, I just can't get over the way you rub elbows with all the celebrities out here.
Well, that's true.
Our elbows are practically raw.
And wait till the girls hear about you dancing with Van Johnson!
You be sure and tell 'em.
Oh, yes.
And all those movie stars I just missed seeing this afternoon.
Mm When do you think you'll see them again?
When are you leaving?
Tonight.
Oh, what a shame.
We're having a big open house here tomorrow afternoon.
Maybe Charlie will let you stay.
No no, I don't think there's a chance.
These reservations were too hard to get.
Yeah.
Well, it's a shame, Caroline, because practically every star in town will be here-- Cary Grant, mm Walter Pidgeon and Marlon and Oh!
Well, at least I got to meet Van.
That's true, that's true.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'd better say good-bye.
Okay.
It's just been wonderful.
It's been nice seeing you, Caroline.
I'm so glad you came out here.
Oh, it was wonderful.
Hi, Caroline.
Hi.
How are you?

Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Oh, boy, I sure envy them going to Honolulu.
Sounds like an awful lot of fun, doesn't it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but-but- but-but wait a minute here.
There is something here that needs 'splaining.
What needs 'splaining?
What's this nonsense about you dancing with Van Johnson?
It's not nonsense.
I did dance with Van Johnson.
She's told so many of those wild stories, she's beginning to believe them herself.
No!
I was there and I saw her.
Well, whatever Lucy's got, it's catching.
It's true.
I've van I danced with Van Johnson this afternoon.
Now look, honey.

Uh, I guess you can, uh, jance, uh, dance just as well alone with him as out there in front of all those people.
You're more nervous than I am.
Yes, I know it.
All those people?
Yeah.
Oh, now, Lucy, don't pay any attention to Fred.
He doesn't make any sense.
The whole world's out there!
Oh, now, honey  Honey!
I've never seen so many people.
Everything all right?
Yeah, but-but there're all those people out there.
So what?
What's the difference?
What's the matter?
What happened?
Oh, thanks to bigmouth Mertz, she's suddenly discovered there's a big crowd out there.
So what, honey?
Well You don't have to worry about the big crowd.
Now, look, honey, let me tell you something.

That's right.
Biggest crowd they've ever had!
Yeah, that's all right, honey.
Biggest crowd they've ever had.
Honey, now, look, you'll be all right.
I can't do it, honey.
Yes, you can.
You go to your table, I'll take care of her.
Honey, I haven't had enough rehearsal, I can't do it.
I haven't had enough rehearsal, honey.

Come on, I'll help you.
I can't, honey.
I'll help you there.
You've got to go on.
Honey, I can't.

Beverly Palms Hotel takes great pride in presenting Van Johnson and partner.

Thank you very much.

Eww!
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
Lucy, did you see this picture of Ricky in the paper?
Yeah, I saw it.
Lucy, did I leave my glasses here last night?
Yeah, Fred.
Right there.
Well, you don't sound very excited.
Ehh, "Ricky Ricardo Crowns Queen Of The Automobile Show".
That's the third one this week.
Ricky's crowned more queens than the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Oh, I think it's a very good picture, don't you, Fred?
Yeah, this automobile queen's got a nice chassis.
I meant the picture of Ricky.
Ricky?
Hey, here's a picture of Ricky, too.
That's all, brother.
What's wrong with this?
Well, look.
"Ricky Ricardo Dedicates New Freeway".
"Ricky Ricardo Opens Supermarket".
"Ricky Ricardo Judges Dog Show".
Well, publicity is mighty important.
Yeah.
Look at this.
"Mammoth car wash opened".
"Ricky Ricardo, left, tosses in first soapy sponge".
What's the matter with that?
Well, they had to say he was on the left so people could tell which one was the sponge.
Oh.
Ah, let's face it, Ethel.
You don't win Academy Awards by patting poodles on the head and crowning queens.
I don't think that studio is ever gonna give him a picture.
Oh, sure they are.
Well, it has been a long time.
Now, what does Ricky think about it?
Oh, the poor thing hasn't got time to think.
He's so busy hopping from one publicity stunt to the other.
Where's Peter Rabbit now?
He has to dance with 100 young college girls.
Can you think of anything worse than that?
Yeah, I can think of a couple of things.
Well, this just can't go on.
This is not the way to  Oh, here he is.
Hi, Rick.
Hi, Rick.
Hi, everybody.
Hi, dear.
How did everything go?
All right, I guess.
Ricky, did you really have to dance with a hundred girls?
That's what they told me.
I lost count sometime ago.
Aw, he's been dancing since 10:00 this morning.
Honey, honey, come on.
Let's dance.
No, now, honey, stop that.
Come now, now, just sit down there.
Come on now, sit down.
Poor boy.
Honey, I've just been going through your scrapbooks and suddenly I got a very objective picture of just what's been happening to you since you came to Hollywood.
Yeah?
This is the last publicity stunt you are going to do.
It is?
Yes.
I've made up my mind.
I'm putting your foot down.
Well, pick it up again because I'm under contract to the studio, you know.
They're paying my salary every week.
Yeah.
He has to do what they say.
That's right.
Besides, they've been in the picture business a long time.
They know what's good for me.
Well, I've been in the Ricky Ricardo business a long time and I know what's better for you.
Look, honey, I don't like it either, but what am I gonna do?
What can he do?
I'll tell you what he can do.
He can march himself right out there and demand that they give him a picture to star in.
And suppose they don't?
You tell them they have to give you a picture or or, uh or, uh Hmm Or or what?
Or else.
Or else what?
Oh, you keep out of this.
Can't you just say, "You give me a picture or else" and let them worry?
Well, honey, now, look, why don't you just forget it, huh?
I feel better if I know that you're not worrying about my career.
I'm awful tired.
I'm going to go lie down for a while.
Okay.
Take a hot bath, honey.
Yeah, something.
Honestly, I don't know what's happened to him.
Forget it, Lucy.
The studio knows what's best for him.
They do not.
They're letting a great talent slip through their fingers.
If only I could get Ricky to do something about it.
Well, what do you want him to do?
Walk in and say, "you'd better use me because my wife thinks I'm very talented".
Well Well, the trouble is that Ricky hasn't got an agent to go in and fight for him.
Fred, when will you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut?
Now, what did I do?
You just lit a fuse that may lead to the biggest explosion we've seen yet.
An agent!
Of course that's what he needs.
Somebody to go in there and tell them how good he is and how many other offers he's had.
But Ricky hasn't got an agent.
He has now.
Gee, I'm glad you gave me this idea, Fred.
What idea?
The idea for this whole plan.
What plan?
This plan wou What's the matter with you, Fred?
Well, I'm just practicing my answers for when Ricky asks me if I know anything about this.
"Oh, what idea, Ricky"?
"What plan are you talking about"?
"Lucy who"?
Oh, Fred.
Lucy, I don't think you'd better meddle in this.
Now, now, look, Ethel, Ethel, nothing's gonna go wrong.
I'm just gonna go out there and light a fire under Dore Schary.
Well, I hope he's wearing asbestos britches.
Texas-03311.
Oh, now, Lucy No H-H-Hello, MGM?
I'd like to speak to Dore Oh.
I just remembered, Dore Schary knows me.
Uh, yes?
Um, um, I'd like to, uh, speak to the vice president in charge of Ricky Ricardo, please.
Ricky Ricardo.
"Who is he"?
He's one of your biggest stars.
"Who is he"?
Uh yes.
Yes, well, I'd like to discuss his contract.
Walter Riley?
Thank you.
Uh, hello, Mr. Riley.
I'm calling for Miss McGillicuddy of the  Agency.
Yeah, this is Miss McGillicuddy's secretary.
Yes, we just signed a new client, Mr. Ricky Ricardo.
Miss McGillicuddy would like to come in and discuss his contract with you.
Lucy, are you still here?
Yeah.
I thought Ricky would never leave.
I'm gonna be late for my appointment with Mr. Riley.
Well, your mother wants a little robe for the baby.
You know where they are, honey.
Yep.
Honey, I thought you'd left.
Well, I went down to the car to get my guitar.
Oh.
You're not going anyplace, are you?
Hmm?
You're not going anyplace, are you?
Uhno.
Oh, hi, hi, Ethel.
Hi, Rick.
Listen, I've got to sing at the opening of a bowling alley this afternoon, so I thought maybe you Will you listen to a song, see if you think it's all right?
Sure.
Op-Opening of a bowling alley?
Yeah.
It's an old Spanish song, you know.
Como un avanicar de calor real En el jardin azul de tu extravio Contremo las angustias musicales Se asoman tus pupilas el astillo Oh, honey, that's just wonderful!
Well, that's just the verse.
This is the chorus.
Oh.
Es que quieren volver Tus amores de ayer a inquiedarme Y me quieren robar el divino penar de adorarte Oh, ha, ha, ha!
Oh.
Pues que quieres vivir Y volver a sentir las al dia De manchar la esmeralda de tus ojos Ojos-- that's eyes, means eyes.
Vida mia.
Ha, ha!
That's wonderful.
Oh, that's wonderful, honey.
They'll love it.
Yeah?
Okay, well, thank you.
Listen, uh, you want to come with me?
Uh no no.
No, it's such a lazy day.
I'm just gonna loll around the house.
Okay, well, I'll see you later.
Okay, Rick.
Good-bye, Ethel.
So long.
Thanks for listening.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
You really liked it, huh?
Oh, it was wonderful.
It was wonderful, honey, yeah.
Oh, my.
Honey, see you later.
Yes?
Mr. Riley, Ricky Ricardo's agent, a Miss McGillicuddy is here.
Ask her to come in, would you, please, Miss Klein?
Yes, sir.
How do you do, Mr. Riley?
How do you do, Miss McGillicuddy?
Down, Riley.
I do not believe that women in business deserve any special privileges.
As you say.
Now then, let's get down to cases.
Mr. Riley, just what does your studio, uh, plan to do with my client?
Well, you see After all, he didn't come all the way out to California just to crown queens and open supermarkets, you know.
Well, we understand all that.
We're just trying to keep his name before the public until we put him in a picture.
And just when do you think that might be, Mr. Riley?
Well, to you tell the truth, we can't seem to find just the right property Uh-huh.
Uh, you see, he's a little difficult to cast.
Not on Broadway, he isn't.
What do you mean?
Mr. Riley, I just flew in from New York where a very famous team of producers have a big musical they are just frantic to star Ricardo in.
Famous team of producers?
Yes.
Of course, I can't reveal their names, but, uh, Oscar and Dick are just wild about the boy.
They really want him?
Unquestionably.
But I said to them, "You can't have him, Oscar, and neither can you, Dick".
Well, this throws an entirely new light on things.
I thought it would.
This could cause quite a stir around here.
I'm sure it could.
I'd better call Mr. Schary about this.
I think you should.
Uh, Mr. Schary, please.
Hello, Dore.
Uh, Walt.
Say, uh, Ricky Ricardo's agent is in here and Well, he has one now.
She's been telling me that Ricky has an offer to star in a Broadway show.
Well, that's the way I feel about it, too.
He's a great talent.
We should have used him in a picture long before this.
Oh, I agree with you completely.
I think it should be right away.
All right, I'm sure she'll be delighted.
All right.
Good-bye.
Well, Miss McGillicuddy, I have great news for you.
Yes?
Yes.
We have decided to release Ricky from his contract.
What did you say?
I say we have decided to release Ricky from his contract.
But I, uh if, if He's, uh released?
: Surprised?
Yeah.
Boy, am I surprised.
Well, I don't blame you.
You know, we don't do this very often, but we're very fond of Ricky and we don't want to stand in his way.
Yeah, well, then why, why, why, uh He's released?
He's released.
He's released.
Well, Miss McGillicuddy, I certainly want to wish you a lot of good luck.
Yeah, well, I'll need it.
I may be back in New York in time for the opening of his show.
If I am, perhaps you can send me some passes, eh.
: Yeah.
Yeah  Well, thank you so much for dropping in.
Uh M-M-Mr. Riley?
Yes?
See you at the opening.
All right.
Good-bye.
Will you come in, please, Miss Klein?
Yes, Mr. Riley?
Mr. Riley, I've been thinking it over and I can't do this to you.
How do you mean?
Well, uh, look at it this way.
Uh, you release Ricky from his contract, he goes to Broadway and becomes a tremendous success.
And then Metro buys the film rights to the musical and they want Ricky to play the lead.
Naturally, since, uh, Ricky has become such a huge success, I have to demand a huge salary.
Then someone remembers that he was under contract to you and he was released.
They demand to know who released him and every finger points to you, Walter Riley.
They fire you immediately.
And no other studio will hire such a dunce.
You become a penniless bum.
Now, I don't want to have to go through life, knowing that I was responsible for making you, Walter Riley end up in the gutter.
I appreciate your concern, but I'm afraid I'll just have to take that chance, Miss McGillicuddy.
Good-bye.
He's released, huh?
Yes.
Good-bye, Miss McGillicuddy.
Bye.
Come in, Miss Klein.
Yes, sir?
Mr. Riley Mr. Riley, you're doing lots of remakes.
Why don't you take one of your big hits and do it over for Ricky?
Tailor it for him.
Well Like, uh I'm afraid not.
Like Gone With The Cuban Wind?
I'm afraid not.
Or, uh, It Happened One Noche?
I'm afraid not.
Afraid not.
Well, it was just a thought.
How about Seven Brides For Seven Cubans?
No.
The Ricardos of Wimpole Street?
No, thank you.
All right, Miss Klein.
Andy Hardy Meets a Conga Player?
Lock it.
Lock it.
Take a letter, will you, please?
Yes, sir.
Uh, it's to A.J. Uh Dear A.J.: Regarding your visit here to us next month to discuss plans for the coming year, I have already set up meetings for you with the heads of the various departments and arranged a press party for you.
Dore wants you and your wife to spend the weekend Mr. Riley!
How about Ricky Ricky, Son Of Flicka?
A A Streetcar Named Ricardo?
Three Cubans In A Fountain?
Uh Meet Me In St. Ricky?
Now, then Arsenic And Old Ricky?
Well, Lucy, did you?
What happened?
Ooh, look how pale she is.
Look at her eyes.
She looks like a frightened horse.
Lucy?
Lucy, I can't stand it.
What happened?
Are they gonna put Ricky in a picture?
Are they just gonna keep on like they're going now?
Well, there's no other alternative, is there?
What?
They released him from his contract.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, Lucy, when Ricky finds out you got him fired, he'll kill you!
If I could only be sure that's all he'll do.
How did this happen, Lucy?
Well, I I went in to talk to Mr. Riley and I told him that-that Ricky had a big musical on Broadway and he called Dore Schary.
And they said they didn't want to stand in his way : and they released him from his contract!
Oh, Lucy, what are you gonna do?
: I don't know.
Oh, honey.
I thought maybe I'd dye my hair black and move to Mexico.
But first I'm gonna swim to Catalina to throw him off the scent.
Oh, honey There's just one thing I can do, Ethel.
What?
I'm just gonna have to face him with what I've done.
Oh, you know Ricky's temper.
Yeah, we've met.
Well, you're gonna meet again.
I don't want to be here for the reunion.
I've done a terrible thing.
I've ruined his career.
Anything he does to me, I deserve.
Oh, now, honey.
For 14 years Ricky's been trusting, devoted, understanding and what have I been?
Thoughtless, selfish, meddlesome bungling, scheming, conniving eh Irritating, headstrong, obnoxious, self-centered Fred!
It's all right, Ethel.
Let him alone.
He's right.
Well, as long as it's open season, how about petty, childish, stubborn, vain All right, let's not get carried away.
What are we standing here for?
Ricky will be here any minute.
Come on, you'd better hide in our room.
Yeah, come on.
No, uh-uh.
No, uh-uh.
Come on.
Come on now, honey.
You can leave him a note and then come back when the storm blows over.
No, I'm gonna stay right here and face him.
What, with a chair and a whip?
We're not gonna let you do it.
Now come on!
You'd better come with us.
No, I'm not.
It is for your own good.
Come on now, honey.
Hi, everybody!
Hi!
Oh, um, Uh, Rick, uh, Lucy, uh, uh Uh, she Ricky.
Ricky, I have something to say to you.
Well, I'll see you later.
So long, Rick.
We have something we have to do.
See you around.
What's the matter with them?
They don't want to watch, and I don't blame them.
Watch what?
Give me a kiss?
One last farewell kiss?
What's the matter with you, honey?
Ricky I went out to MGM today and got you fired.
What are you talking about?
I went out to MGM today and pretended that I was your agent.
You what?
!
Now you're getting it.
I went out to MGM I went out to MGM today and I and I and I said I was your agent and that you were wanted for a big Broadway musical and Dore Schary said they didn't stand in your way, so they released you from your contract and thanks to me, you don't work at Metro anymore.
Whoa!
Well, you don't just stand there.
Throw something!
Throw something!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Here!
Here!
Here!
This is worse than the time you loused up my screen test!
Yeah, yeah, it's worse than when we got arrested in Tennessee!
It was all my fault.
Yeah!
Yeah, it's worse than when we were handcuffed together for Yeah!
Yeah!
It's worse than when I loused up your nightclub act Yeah, yeah!

Give me some more!
Give me some more!

Ohh!
Oh, boy.

Gee.
Ohh.
He killed her and tried to hide her body under the couch!
Oh, Lucy!
No, I'm all right.
Oh, thank heavens, you're alive!
Yeah, not even hurt.
He took his anger out on the bric-a-brac.
Where did he go?
I don't know.
Maybe he went out trying to get a job wrecking houses.
Well, at least it's all over.
I'm not so sure.
I feel that I'll have to live with this for a long time.
Oh, if only you hadn't gone out there today.
Yes, but I did.
I have an idea.
How can you stand there in the middle of all this mess and utter those four horrible words, "I've got an idea"?
Now wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Texas 03311.
She's a cool one; she's returning to the scene of the crime.
Listen, they don't know that Uh, Mr. Riley, please.
They don't know I was the one that was out there today.
Hello, Mr. Riley.
Mr. Riley, this is Mrs. Ricardo, Ricky Ricardo's wife.
Yes, Ricky wanted me to call you and warn you about something.
Yes, it seems there's some woman going around town claiming that she's Ricky's agent, and She was in your office today?
Well!
How crazy can she be?
!
Oh, you don't say.
Mr. Riley, Ricky doesn't have an agent.
No, she certainly is not, and as for that nonsense about Ricky going to Broadway for a big Well well, I-I know sh-she's been going around saying that.
Yes, Mr. Riley, Ricky is very happy working at Metro and he wishes to continue there a long, long time.
He will, won't he?
Oh, bless you, Mr. Riley!
I mean, thank you.
Bye.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Housekeeper, please.
This is Mrs. Ricardo in 315.
Uh, we've had a little accident.
Lucy, where are you?
Here I am, honey, and have I got good news for you.
Yeah, it cost quite a bit, fixing the place up.
But it really doesn't matter because I'll say, it doesn't matter.
What do you mean?
Well, I got myself an agent, and he already got me a job at another studio at three times the money.
Huh?
You know, getting me out of that Metro deal was the best thing you've ever done.
Three times the money, imagine that.
And not only that, but they're gonna star me in four pictures in a row right away.
Four pictures!
Here.
Here.
Oh, I forgot something else, too.
They're gonna give you a contract.
Wait!
Wait!
Hey!
Hey!
What's the matter?
What are you laughing at?
I was just kidding you, honey.
I called Metro and they told me everything was straightened out.
Come here.
Oh, Ricky!
Oh, no!
Oh, Ricky.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
Are you ready?
Lucy, I told you, you cannot go with me.
Yeah, I know you told me that, but you didn't mean it.
Yes, I did mean it.
But, Ricky, you're having lunch with Richard Widmark at Romanoff's.
Correct.
Well, why can't I go with you?
Give me one good reason.
I don't want you there.
Ricky, look.
If you say I can go with you, I promise I-I won't say a word.
All I want to do is just sit and drool at him.
Honey, you won't even know I'm there.
I'll be as quiet as a mouse.
I won't eat very much, just a little piece of cheese.
I'll, I'll even pick up the check for the whole lunch.
How about that?
No, thanks, sport.
Oh, Ricky, please.
Please.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
Please say I can go with you.
You may not go with me.
Ricky Ricardo, can you look me in the eye and tell me I cannot have lunch with Richard Widmark, my idol, my dream man?
You cannot have lunch with Richard Widmark, your idol, your dream man.
Would you like to try the other eye?
Now, look, Lucy, let me try to get this into that little thick skull of yours.
Now, I am not positively, absolutely taking you along with me definitely.
Well, it finally happened.
What has?
I knew the day would come when you'd go too far.
I'm gonna punch you in the nose, buster.
What?
!
Come on now.
Come on now.
Ricky!
Ricky, come on now!
Hey, hey!
What's going on?
Nothing.
Calm down, will you, Lucy?
Calm down!
Calm down!
Lucy, what did he do?
He's having lunch with Richard Widmark at Romanoff's and he won't take me along.
Let me at the dirty rat.
Hey, hey, now.
Never mind, Rocky, never mind.
Honestly, I am never gonna tell you when I'm having lunch with anyone again.
You didn't tell me this time, remember?
Well, I'm never gonna have a telephone with an extension again.
You're just being mean.
You know how much I want to meet him.
Aw, Ricky, why don't you take her along?
What's the harm?
I never thought I'd agree with these two, Rick, but why don't you take her along?
Well, well, well.
It's very obvious that all of you are gonna buyer me, so "Buyer me"?
You know what I mean.
"Buyer me"?
I think there is something that all of you should know.
Well, in these short three months that we've been out here, Lucy has become a Hollywood legend.
Me, a Hollywood legend?
Yes, that's right.
When I'm out in the street, people point me out and say, "There he goes.
"That's the fellow that's married to that redheaded screwball".
Oh, they do not.
And then the first thing they want to know when they meet me: "Is it true "that she threw a pie at Bill Holden in the Brown Derby"?
I told you, I did not throw that pie.
The waiter bumped into me.
Uh-huh, well, yeah.
And then they want to know if she really sneaked into Cornel Wilde's room dressed as a bellhop.
Well, I that And the commotion that that orange that she had Robert Taylor autograph for her at the Farmer's Market.
Now, listen, there's a good, logical reason for everything that's happened to me.
Well, I'm sure that there is, honey, but I haven't got time to listen to them now.
So, uh, I'll see you later, character.
Yee-ee-ee.
Yeah, I'll see you.
I don't like that tone.
You are thinking again.
There's no law against my going to Romanoff's, too, and perhaps dropping by your table and delivering a cheery little hello	Lucy to someone that I	Lucy think is real dreamy.
Lucy!
What?
I want you to listen to me and I want you to listen very carefully.
If I as much as see your face in Romanoff, I am gonna wrap you up in brown paper and mail you back to New York!
And that's an ultimatum!
An ultimatum?
!
Well, I'm not surprised.
I am.
I didn't think he knew how to pronounce it.
Oh, nuts.
Hey, I know where you can go and be surrounded by movie stars Where?
all afternoon.
Take that bus trip we were reading about, the one that goes through Beverly Hills.
Oh, I don't want to see the outsides of their houses.
I want to see them in person, up close.
That's right, you like to be within pie-throwing range.
Oh, Fred!
Well, you two do what you like.
I'm going to the ball game.
Good-bye.
Where's that pamphlet, tells about that bus ride?
Over here.

There's no way out.
Oh For heaven's sake.
Oh, listen.
Yeah?
Listen.
Huh?
The back door is open, and I'll sneak in and I'll sneak through the house and get out the front.
You wait for me out there.

It's the only way.
Now go-go on!
I'm coming!
I'm coming.
Mr. Widmark's residence.
Oh, hi.
No, I'm not busy.
Mr. Widmark's off to the studio and I've got nothing to do.
What's new?
No kidding?
You really broke up with him?
Tell me all about it.
Oh.
Really?
You don't mean it.
Oh.
Oh, Fred.
Oh, thank goodness you're home.
Listen, I'm in Beverly Hills, and Lucy's in an awful mess.
Never mind "what else is new".
Now, listen, we got off of the bus in front of Richard Widmark's house because Lucy wanted to pick a grapefruit that was growing in his backyard.
So, she got up on the wall and she tried to get it and she fell over the other side and then she told me that she couldn't get out.
So, she said for me to go around and wait in front and that she would go through the house and meet me out there and I've been standing out there for an hour and she never did come out Stop saying, "Madam, you've got the wrong number"!
Now, this-this is the worst part.
Richard Widmark just drove by here and he had Ricky in the car with him and we've got to get Lucy out of there.
Now, I've got a plan.
Oh.
Oh, really?
You don't mean it.
Oh.
Uh, say, listen, Mr. Widmark just drove up.
I've got to go now.
Good-bye.
Come on in, Rick.
Hey, this is a lovely house.

Just beyond that is the dining room and a little breakfast room.
Uh-huh.
And, uh, right in here is the trophy room.
Oh, this is nice.
Come on, I'll show you the pool.

I'd love to see the backyard.
Now, there's the pool right over there.
Oh, isn't that nice?
Over there to the left, that's the tennis court.
Oh, yeah.
You play a lot of tennis?
Oh, not too much.
I'm getting a little old for that.
I'm taking up golf, yeah.

Oh, yeah.
I got started on it when I was on location in Africa.
Oh, yeah.
I got that water buffalo here.
Isn't that beautiful?
You know, I had an uncle who combed his hair just like that.
Say, Rick, did you ever shoot a gun?
Well, I won a Kewpie doll at Coney Island once.
Well, I was hoping to get some shooting in last summer in Germany.
I made a picture there called A Prize Of Gold, but I was too busy.
Oh, yeah, you know, a lot of people told me that that's a great picture.
Well, it's nice to know that people are saying something about it anyway.
Hey, you see those two heads there?
What are those?
Those are boars' heads.
Wow!
Got those down at Borneo.
Look at those teeth.
Yeah.
Aren't they something, though?
Mm-hmm.
You seen your dentist lately?
A couple of years ago, I was over in India Uh-huh.
and I got this tiger.

What do you think of this?
I don't know what he's laughing at.
What are those over there?
Oh, hose are giant sable antelope antlers.
They're sharp.
Say, Ricky Ricky, I've been meaning to ask you: These stories I've been hearing about your wife, are they true?
Oh, yeah.
I mean, did she really throw a pie at Bill Holden?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
She did, huh?
Yeah, I've been waiting for you to ask me that.
You were?
Um you know that story about her throwing a pie at Holden at the Brown Derby?
Yeah, that's the one I heard.
And also that thing about she sneaking into Cornel Wilde's room Yeah, I heard about it.
That's true.
And then she met Taylor at the Farmer's Market one day and she asked him to sign his orange.
I heard rumors about that.
I'll tell you You know something?
She's a very nice girl, but, uh, it's just that something happens to her when she gets close to a movie star.
Yeah, I got you.
I got you.
As a matter of fact, she wanted to join us in our luncheon today.
What?
No, don't worry about it.
She's not within ten miles of here.
Well, that's good.
From the way she sounds, I might end up with another head on my wall.
Listen, Ricky.
Yeah?
Have you ever seen a real elephant gun?
No.
Well, take a look at this.
Oh.
I got this about five years ago down in Nairobi.
Isn't that a beautiful thing?

Please, I can explain.
It's all very normal and natural.
I-I can tell you just how it happened, but put that down first, please.
