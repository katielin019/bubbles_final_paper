{START OF EPISODE 1}
Oh, Lucy, this party's a wonderful idea.
I think so.
I still can't think why we're having this party for Ricky.
Oh, it's just something you do in Hollywood, Fred.
When a person finishes a picture, you give a party for him.
Oh.
Oh, gee, Ethel, those hors d'oeuvres you bought are just scrumptious.
Thanks.
But caviar- you shouldn't have done that.
Oh, why not?
Well, enjoy it.
After all, how many Hollywood stars do we know?
But caviar, five dollars a jar.
Ow!
Five bucks for a jar of fish eggs?
!
Oh, now, Fred!
Don't make anything out of it.
Five bucks is five bucks.
Well, it's for a party.
We'll talk about it later.
Look.
What a beautiful cake!
Isn't it dreamy?
Oh, Lucy!
Yeah, it's great.
"To my darlin', another Marlon.
" Marlon?
Marlon Brando.
Do you know anybody else named Marlon?
Sure.
Monroe.
Marlon Monroe!
Oh, Fred.
I'm going to get the baby.
I promised him he could come to the party.
I wouldn't want to disappoint the little doll.
Oh, boy.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, now, Fred, no sneak previews.
Well, you'd think I could have one bite.
After all, my life savings are tied up in those hors d'oeuvres.
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi, son.
He's so sleepy.
Oh, hello, honey.
Here he comes.
Hide the cake.
Hide the cake.
LUCY, FRED AND  Happy party to you Happy party to you Happy end of the picture, dear Ricky Happy party to you I bought the caviar.
Aren't you nice!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Say, happy party, papa.
Hiya, there, partner.
He's so sleepy.
Hi, my son.
Show him the cake, honey.
Show him the cake.
Oh, look at that beautiful cake!
"To my darlin', another Marlon.
"  Well, I guess Brando and I do have a lot in common.
Yeah, I can't understand either of you when you talk.
Well, he's got to go back to bed, honey.
You can have your cake in the morning.
Say good night.
All right, son.
I'll save you a nice, big piece.
Aw, he wants to say beddy-bye.
I'll take him.
You take him, honey.
We'll give you a piece of cake in the morning, sweetie.
Honey, we'll give you a piece of cake in the morning.
It's so late.
I thought I was gonna finish early.
Well, I shouldn't have brought him out, but I I'll be right in, son.
I'm sorry, honey.
Well, how did the picture go, dear?
Well, everybody seems to think it's going to be a hit- a big hit.
Wonderful.
Well, here is to Hollywood.
Oh, wait for me.
Wait a minute.
Wait for Ethel.
Wait for Ethel.
Here, hon.
Here were are.
Here is to Hollywood.
Here's to Hollywood.
It's been fun, but it'll be nice to get back home.
Home?
Home?
Sure.
I'm finished with the picture.
There's nothing to keep us here now.
Well, I know, bu-but we can't leave Hollywood yet.
Why not?
Because there are a million things we haven't seen.
The Coconut Grove.
Olvera Street.
Ava Gardner.
The Hollywood Bowl.
Catalina Island.
Ava Gardner.
We heard you the first time.
Oh, we haven't seen the footprints at Grauman's Chinese Theater.
Well, I'm sorry, honey, but I got to go back to work.
I got to go back to work at the Tropicana.
You know, the studio's not paying for this anymore.
I am.
Oh, all right, warden.
When do we leave?
Well, just as soon as you can get ready.
How long will it take you?
Six years.
Lucy Well, if you're going to bargain, I want to start high.
Come on, Lucy.
Four years.
Come on!
Oh, it isn't fair, Ricky.
We haven't seen anything and we have no souvenirs to take home No souvenirs?
Well, hardly any.
What do you call this?
You got a whole box full of junk.
Junk?
!
Do you call an orange autographed by Robert Taylor junk?
Look at this old, dried-up thing.
You can't even read his name.
The letters are all shriveled together.
Oh, they are not.
It's very clear.
It says : "Robert Taylor.
" How about this- this old, tired grapefruit?
That says, "Richard Widmark.
" It does?
Well, it did when it was young.
Right there, in that deep crevice.
Sure, it says, uh, : "Richard Richard Widmark.
" Robert Taylor and Richard Widmark.
Look at this- an old tin can.
Just a minute.
That is not an ordinary old tin can.
This just happens to be an old tin can that was squashed by Cary Grant's left rear wheel.
Oh, well, that's different.
Yeah, well.
What's this?
"Lana Turner's Lipstick Print.
" Which one of you morons is saving this?
I am!
Give it here before you smear it.
Menus from the Brown Derby.
Yes.
Match covers from Ciro's.
An ashtray from the Beverly Hilton.
So?
Chopsticks from the Beachcomber.
You got enough stuff here.
Don't worry.
We have not, Ricky.
We just haven't been anyplace.
Now, you just got to give us more time.
Come on, Rick.
We really wanted to see where you were making the picture.
You said that you would go with us after you finished.
All right.
All right.
I'll tell you what.
We'll stay one more week.
Good!
Great!
That's all.
One more week.
That's enough.
Now, we'll start the first thing in the morning.
What'll we see first?
I vote for Catalina.
I vote for Grauman's Chinese.
We got the majority.
I got the car.
Grauman's Chinese.
Grauman's Chinese.
Oh, hurry up, Fred.
You've been focusing that thing for We haven't got all day.
All right.
All right.
I'm ready now.
Come on, look at me, Ethel.
Come on, look at me and smile, Ethel.
Make up your mind.
I can't do both.
Watch for the little birdie, now.
One two  Fred!
Three!
There.
I got a good one.
Don't forget to turn it up to the next picture.
Oh, look, Ethel.
Gloria Swanson's footprints.
Oh, doesn't she have tiny little feet?
I'll say, about size one-and-a-half, I would say.
Oh, Harold Lloyd!
Harold Lloyd's footprint.
Oh, look.
His glasses.
Isn't that cute?
How do you suppose they ever did that?
Oh, Lucy, Tyrone Power.
What are you doing?
Comparing my leg to Betty Grable's.
Oh, it looks identical.
Oh, what, to you and me, maybe, but I doubt if it would fool Harry James.
Oh, look.
Joan Crawford's footprint.
Oh, my feet are smaller than Joan Crawford's.
Let me try.
Mine aren't.
Hey!
Look, my feet are smaller than Gary cooper's.
No kidding?
Yeah.
Look.
Mine aren't.
Oh, here's one for you to try, Ethel- Trigger!
Oh, Ethel, look!
Oh!
John Wayne!
Oh, boy, just his footprints give me goose bumps.
We got to go see his new picture, Blood Alley.
I hear it is just wonderful.
I heard it was so exciting.
Oh, he plays the part of a daring adventurer and his block is loose.
John Wayne's block is loose.
It is?
Yeah.
Ethel?
What?
I've got an idea.
I don't like that look on your face.
I'm going to take home a souvenir to end all souvenirs- John Wayne's block.
Well, you'll need it, 'cause when Ricky finds out what you've done, he'll knock yours off.
Now, let's see how we will go about it.
We?
!
Oh, ho.
Count me out.
I wouldn't touch that with a ten-foot pole.
Oh, now now, listen here, Ethel.
How would you like to be the only woman in New York City with a friend who has John Wayne's footprints under her bed?
Not interested.
Well, then, how would you like to be the only woman in New York City who has John Wayne's footprints under her own bed?
Every other week.
Oh Okay.
Now, let's see Oh, Lucy, how are we gonna steal a big cement block like that without being seen?
It's a cinch.
We'll come here late at night when nobody else is around.
We'll bring a crowbar and we'll pry it up.
Okay.
Now, we'll Ooh, wait just a second.
What'll you do about the space it'll leave?
We'll bring some quick-drying cement, fill it in, it'll be dry by morning.
Lucy, you're a natural-born crook.
Thank you, ma'am.
Now, we'll need cement, a bucket, a trawl, a crowbar and a car to make a quick getaway.
Now, is there anything else we'll need?
Yeah.
A good lawyer.
Fred!
Yes, "Fred"!
I heard the whole thing.
You two dames have had some pretty nutty schemes in your time, but this one is regular Bellevue bait.
Oh, come on, Fred.
Help us, huh?
I will not, and you're not gonna do it either.
Oh, come on, please, Fred.
Ethel, Ethel, Ethel, never mind.
It's a real crazy idea.
Fred's right.
Just forget it.
I'll go and get the car.
I'd better put you two squirrels back in your cage.
Lucy, what's happened to you?
I never saw you give up so easy.
Who's giving up?
I just want to throw him off the scent so he doesn't go blabbing to Ricky.
Oh, sorry, Chief.
Now, here's what we're gonna do and this is the way There's nobody around.
Good.
I thought Ricky would never go to sleep.
Oh, Fred was a little restless, too.
He didn't start to snore till his head hit the pillow.
Oh, Lucy, I'm scared.
What if somebody sees us?
Listen, Ethel, if you're gonna get chicken on a routine souvenir hunt Routine?

Come on.
Okay.
Oh, say, we'd better hurry.
This cement's getting hard.
Really?

You ought to try sitting on a crowbar.
Oh!
What do I do?
Just lift it up so I can get my hand out.
One hand.

Just what I needed- two Chinese back scratchers.

I thought you said he was home snoring!
He was snoring when I left.
What woke you up?
You did.
I did?
I wasn't even there!
That's what did it.
There was nobody poking me in the ribs until I made a rollover.
Now put that down!

All right.
Let's have the story.
Story?
What makes you think there's a story?
Well, the Mertzes are in their beds with their clothes on and you have your foot in what seems to be a block of cement.
I just thought there might be a little explanation.
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
All right, Lucy.
Let's have it.
Well, uh, I was restless and couldn't sleep.
You see, I have this foot condition It's sort of a hardening of the arches.
I I'm not buying that.

Well, I, uh We went to Grauman's Chinese Theatre on a routine souvenir hunt, and, uh, while we were there, we, uh, we saw this hunk of cement with John Wayne's footprints on it an-and we decided to-to swipe this hunk of cement and while we were doing it, the cops came along and we got scared and we tried to hide in some bushes and that's just where Ethel had put a a big bucket of cement an-and, uh, and my foot got caught in it.
Well, you've told me a lot of crazy stories in your time, but this is the craziest.
Now, come on, Fred, Ethel.
What's the truth?
!
She's telling the truth!
That's the truth!
We got the block of cement right under the bed.

John Wayne.
See?
See?
See, his footprints.

: Good morning.
Well, you're certainly in a bad humor this morning.
What do you expect after last night?
Oh, now, honey, that wasn't so bad.
I know it seemed terrible last night, but when you stop to think of it, it's really kind of funny.
Fred, Ethel and me lugging that big hunk of cement all the way from the theater and then you making us lug it all the way back and then us dropping it and breaking it into a million pieces.
It's really hilarious, honey!
It's not funny.
I just hope it isn't in the morning papers.

Come on now, eat your breakfast.
Where is the morning paper?
What morning paper?
Our morning paper.

You see, they're crazy about souvenirs.

They went down there and just pried the cement loose, you see.
With a crowbar.
And then they took it home with them!
Is he laughing?
No.
Oh.

I just made a duplicate of John Wayne's footprints.
Now, now, now, now, don't touch it.
It's still wet.
How do you like it?
Oh, it's pretty awful, Fred.
Well, it's terrible, Fred.
That's no good.
What's wrong with it?
Well, for one thing, the feet are way too big.
Yeah.
I guess I shouldn't have used Ethel's shoes.
Besides, the real footprints were made with Western boots, not shoes.
And you don't spell Wayne "W-a-i-n.
" W- a-y-n-e.
Oh, I'll go make another one.
Oh, forget it, Fred.
You know, it's dishonest to forge footprints.
Yeah.
Look who's turning honest all of a sudden- Dishwater Mertz and Frowsy Ricardo.
Don't use that expression again if you don't mind.
I don't like it.
Hello.
Just a minute, please.

You're gonna your hair done at a time like this?
!
If I have to go to jail, I do not want to be referred to as a Frowsy Redhead!
What am I gonna do?
Well, you can always shoot yourself.
Well, come on, think of something.
Well What's the matter with me?
Why don't I call Duke?
Who?
Duke- John Wayne.
All his friends call him Duke.
Oh.
He's a wonderful guy!
I had lunch with him at the studio a couple of times.
I'll bet you he'll help me out.
Yeah, well, what if he won't?
Then I'll shoot myself.
Fred, what do you think of that?
Good.
Looks nice and smooth.
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah.
Hello?
Oh!
Send him right up, please.
Thank you.
He's here.
He's sure an all right guy.
Say, Rick, is it really true that John Wayne is as tough as he appears to be on the screen?
Well, he's pretty big and well-built.
Yeah, well, I heard a fella in the barbershop said the other day that when you shake hands with John Wayne, it's like putting your fingers in a vise.
Well, I don't know about that.
Well, I got a pretty good grip myself, you know.
Fred, you're not going to act like a cornball, are you?
Oh, now, don't worry.
I'm going over to get Ethel's autograph book.
She'll want his signature.
All right.
If you annoy him, enough, you may find out how tough he is.
All right, all right.
Hi, Duke!
Hey!
Hi!
Good to see you.
Nice to see you, Duke.
It-it's sure great of you to help me out this way.
Oh, well, I'm glad to.
I'm very flattered that your wife is such a fan of mine, stealing my footprints.
Is she here?
No, no.
Oh, well, that's too bad.
I've heard a lot about her- from Bill Holden.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
'Course I accused him of making a lot of it up.
Yeah, well, uh, look, uh, John, uh, speaking of-of fans, I have a friend of mine that lives next door here, and I think he's gonna come over and ask for your autograph.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, absolutely not.
I'm afraid of the day they won't want it.
Well, I also have an awful hunch that he's gonna try to shake hands with you and try to find out how strong your grip is.
Oh, another one Yeah.
of those, eh?
Well, if he's a friend of yours, we'll humor him.
Hi!
Hi, Count!
Not "Count.
" Duke.
"Mr. Wayne" to you.
John, this is Fred Mertz.
Howdy, pardner!
How do ya do-o-o-o-o?
Ooh!
I'm sorry.
You've got quite a grip there, fella.
Yeah, well, I used to box a little when I was a young fella.
Really?
Fred, don't press your luck, huh?
Oh, no, no.
I'm sorry.
Hey, I forgot.
Would you sign my wife's autograph book for me?
Well, I'd be glad to Here's a pencil.
as soon as I can get some blood back in this hand.
Rick, Ethel's gonna flip when she sees this.
Yeah, well, let's get going with the footprints We don't want to waste John's time.
Thank ya, Count.
Duke.
I wore the same shoes I had on when I made this the first time.
Oh, that's great.
Yeah, just put them right in there.
That's it.
Now we get the other one.
Here.
That's it.
Here, Rick.
Here.
That's it.
Attaboy.
I'll take it.
I tell you what- we'd better get downstairs and get these boots shined.
All right, Rick.
Fine.
Now for the signature, let's put it on top of the table, huh?
All right.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Don't strain yourself.
I'll handle that.
Kinda heavy.
Well, I was just too nervous to sit there, that's all.
Well, you might have let me take the curlers out of my hair.
You could.
I can think with curlers in my hair.
Now, for heaven's sake, I got a few things on my Oh, look.
Freddy the Forger strikes again!
No, the writing is different.
I think Ricky did this.
Well, nice try, but they'll never get away with it.
Oh, dear, what's the matter with those characters?
They can't forge a thing like this.
Millions of people have seen this.
Everybody knows what John Wayne's signature looks like.
Look what I got for you, honeybunch.
What?
Oh What is it?
"Good luck.
John Wayne.
" Oh, Fred.
Oh, honestly, Fred.
I'm surprised you haven't started forging his name on checks.
What do you mean?
!
That's John Wayne's signature.
Oh, sure.
Yes, it is Hi.
Hey, Rick, They don't believe that's John Wayne's signature.
Sure it is.
He signed it while he was here a few minutes ago.
He wa He was He wa?
Wha?
Wha?
Wha?
I thought you'd be surprised.
I don't believe it!
Sure, honey.
He's down there in the lobby getting his boots shined.
Yeah.
He got them all dirty when he stuck the boots in th No!
No!
I'm sorry, honey!
What happened?
!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
I didn't know!
We thought it was some more of little Freddy's finger painting.
Oh, no!
Oh, honey, honey, I'm sorry.
Look, you said he's downstairs.
Why don't go get him, ask him to do it again?
I can't do that.
Well, why not?
He-he'll understand.
He's in movies.
Tell him it's a retake.
Well, all right, all I have to do is go to jail.
Your whole career will be ruined.
Yes.
All right.
Mira que tengo que Mira que tengo que ir abajo y decirle al hombre que ponga el foot en el cemento otra vez!
Oh, Lucy, that was a great idea.
Gee, we not only get off the hook, but we get to meet John Wayne in person.
Right up here.
Oh, John Wayne!
Oh, I can hardly wait.
He's so big and strong and rugged.
Ha!
What do you mean, "Ha"?
Well, he may be big and strong and rugged, but I'm bigger and stronger and ruggeder.
Oh, Fred, what are you babbling about?
They say he's got a grip like a vise, but he was like putty in the hands of Old Bone Crusher Mertz!
Oh, honestly, Fred, you're really gone.
Well, I mean it!
When I gave him the iron grip, he went right down to his knees!
Here.
I'll show you.
Like that?
Yeah, you big bully.
Oh, honestly, Fred.
There we are- all smoothed out and ready for another try.
Gee, I hope Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha!
What's so funny?
This is your big chance to meet John Wayne.
You have curlers in your hair.
Yikes!
I'll go home and take them out.
I'll be right back.
Hiya, girls.
I want you to meet John Wayne.
Oh!
John, this is Mrs. Mertz.
Oh Mr. Wayne, how do you do?
And, uh, this is my wife Lucy, John.
How do you do, Mr. Wayne?
How do you do?
I didn't expect you up here quite like this.
I I'm so terribly sorry.
I- I wasn't ready for it.
Does she always wear her pocketbook on her head?
I'm afraid I owe Bill Holden an apology.
Yeah, well, le- let's get going with the, with the footprints.
You sit right Yeah.
over there, John.
Oh, my, you really gonna put your foot?
Mr. Wayne, this is so nice of you to do this for us.
Oh, nothing is too much for a fan like you, Mrs. Ricardo.
Yeah, well, I certainly am a fan of yours, let me tell you that.
I've seen every one of your pictures.
Oh, so have I, sir.
Whose curler is this?
Don't look at me.
I'm just I'm just dying just dying to see you in Blood Alley.
Yeah, I've seen all of your pictures.
You know, every single one of them.
You know, when you were up in that plane, in The High and the Mighty, when your motor conked out, my motor conked out right along with it.
That's real acting, you know, real, real acting.
Lucy.
You always Lucy!
Lucy, get the!
lots of people who are wonderful, but you are the best Lucy, dear, get the pen for the signature, honey.
Oh!
Oh, I'm gonna keep this the rest of my life.
Save me a piece.
Yeah.
We're really gonna get to see him do it just like Oh, what penmanship!
Well, I'm getting to where I can do it faster each time.
Ah, ha, ha!
Oh, he's so funny.
Oh, a sense of humor.
Well, we'd better get back to the shoeshine parlor.
Oh, do you really have to go?
Yeah.
Yeah, he has to go, girls.
John, I promise you.
John, I promise you.
This will be the last time.
Well, I'm afraid it'll have to be.
As much as I love stepping in wet cement, I'm afraid I'll be late at the studio.
Well, you keep making those pictures for us.
Bye, John.
Good-bye.
Don't you quit.
Good-bye!
Good-bye, John.
Oh Isn't he a wonderful guy?
He is, Rick.
Well, all we have to do now is take the block of cement to Grauman's Chinese and everything is straightened out.
Eh, Lucy?
Lucy?
Lucy!
Come on, honey, let's get the block of cement.
We'll take it to the theater, huh?
Come on.
Okay.
Oh, no!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, no!
I'm telling you, I walked around for two hours before I got enough nerve to come over here and ask you to do it again.
My wife doesn't know I'm here.
I suppose those things happen.
Pardon me, Ricky.
That's okay.
Come in.
Is this okay to go on with, Mr. Wayne?
Looks okay to me.
Better check with Mr. Wellman.
Thank you.
Hello!
Oh.
Your wife and her friend are at the gate.
I tell you what.
Pretend you're mad.
Pretend?
Let them stew for a while, and then we'll surprise them with this, you see.
Tell them, "No"!
No!
"Absolutely not"!
Absolutely not!
"Don't bother me with a thing like that no more"!
Don't bother me with a thing like that no more!
Ready for your rubdown?
Oh, don't bother with that.
George'll Oh, I insist.
This is the least I can do.
Ready on the set, Mr. Wayne, for the beach scene!
Okay!
George, you'll have to wait till after this scene.
Okay.
Sorry, Ricky, I'll have to get on the set.
Sure, sure.
How can I ever thank you?
Make this the last time.
: Okay, sure.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Closer to the  Wait.
That's enough.
Ooh!
There.
Oh, Lucy, are you sure that'll work?
Listen, when Mr. Wayne comes out of his dressing room, he must step down there.
That way, we will have his footprints.
It's that simple.
What about his signature?
Once we have his footprints, how can he refuse to sign?
I don't see how can he refuse to punch you in the nose.
Oh!
Ricky, what are you doing here?
I came I came Aah  He didn't even say good-bye.
Oh, Lucy, look.
He came down here to get John Wayne's footprints again.
Ethel, we're saved.
The signature, it isn't touched, see?
All I have to do now is go in there, steal a pair of his boots, make the imprints and our troubles are over.
Okay.
I'll get this stuff out of here.
All right.
Well, give me five ten minutes, will ya?
I want to get a rubdown.
Ah George?
: Yeah?
Let's get on with the rubdown.
Hurry it up!
I haven't got all day.
Oh, cut the comedy, George.
Get on with the rubdown.
The robe, George!
Harder.
You heard any good stories lately, George?
Nope.
Oh, I heard a beaut in the steam room the other day.
It seems there was this traveling salesman  who couldn't find a hotel room in this town but he did find a farmer who had a beautiful daughter.
Hey!
Take it easy, will ya?
Well, anyway, it was raining outside   Mr. Wayne!
Yes?
Mr. Wayne, you're ready on the set!
They want you on the set.
Okay.
George, I'm wanted on the set.
George!
Are you ready for your rub now?
You just gave me one!
I just got here.
I'm beginning to worry about you, George.
You're getting punchy!
I don't know.
I don't know.
I just ran out of his dressing room and I was so scared, I just came on home.
I don't know what happened to Ethel.
Well, let's just hope for the best.
Don't worry, Fred.
She'll show up.
I said let's hope for the best.
Fred, I am worried about Ethel.
Hi.
Hi.
Come on in, Duke.
Duke?
!
I told him what happened and he was just a doll.
Oh, Mr. Wayne, I'm so!
Oh, you're so wonderful!
Thank you so much.
John, I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, that's so wonderful of you.
And we're gonna take good care of that.
Don't you worry.
And I took care of that, too.
Come in here!
I brought you a six-month supply!
Great!
Oh!
Oh, that's great!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hello, hello.
Oh!
It's just a model of my head that the studio made for the trick shots.
Oh, what a terrible thing to do.
Don't you ever come home with two heads again.
Not-not bad, huh?
Same eyes, same nose, same lips.
Can't tell the difference, can you?
Nope.
Lucy I'm only kidding.
You kiss much better.
Sheesh, what a wonderful souvenir to take back home and I know just what to do with it.
We'll put it on top of the piano.
Oh, great.
No, really, I think it would look wonder Hey, it'd make a wonderful lamp!
Lamp?
Yeah, look.
Sure, a little longer neck, you'd make a wonderful floor lamp.
I'm going to take a shower.
I'd better get this out of the way.
If little Ricky sees this, it'll scare him to pieces.
Gee, if I just had two of these heads, they'd make wonderful bookends.
Yeah, but don't get any ideas.
Oh Hey, I forgot to tell you.
I made a date to go dipsy fishing.
Dipsy fishing?
Yeah, you know, in the ocean.
Oh!
Deep-sea fishing.
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
Oh, that's wonderful, honey.
Hey, Ricky, can I No.
And don't stick your tongue out at me.
Oh, honey, I promise I won't say a word while the fish are biting.
Oh About this dipsy fishing Now, you know I'm not the kind of girl that talks  Will you excuse me?
Thank you very much.
Hello?
Is Ricky Ricardo there?
Yes, he is, but he's busy right now.
Could I take a message?
Yeah.
This is Chip Jackson over at MGM.
Oh.
We're having a studio party tomorrow night and we thought Ricky could help entertain in a show we're putting on for the executives.
Well, I'm sorry, but he's For the executives?
Mm-hmm.
All the big shots will be there.
Well, uh Mr. Ricardo does do an act with Mrs. Ricardo, a great undiscovered talent, and, uh, if he could, uh, a-appear with Mrs. Ricardo, I think he would do it.
He doesn't like to appear without her.
She's really very talented.
Hello, hello?
Are you still there?
Uh yes.
Uh eh, eh, is Mrs. Ricardo really good?
Is she?
I'll say I am- she am.
She is.
Uh well, uh well, as long as we can get Mr. Ricardo.
Well, now just a moment, and I'll check with him.
Ricky?
Yeah?
!
MGM's on the wire.
They want to know if you'll appear at a studio party tomorrow night.
Absolutely not!
I'm going fishing!
He says he'd love to.
Oh, fine.
Meet at Fox Century.
Oh, they'll be there.
Bye.
Did you tell them?
Yeah, I told them.
That's too bad about the studio party, honey, but nobody's gonna keep me from this fishing trip.
I don't know why you want to go fishing anyway.
You know you're not gonna catch any fish.
Why do you say that?
Well, you know the old saying: You can't catch fish in a month that has an "R" in it.
That's for oysters.
Oh.
What's the matter?
Don't you want me to go?
Oh, sure, I do.
I- It's just that I'll miss you.
Oh, now, honey, I'll only be gone a couple of days.
All right, all right, go ahead and go.
I don't care I don't care if you'd rather go fishing than be with me.
Oh, now, honey.
You love fish better than you do your own wife.
Now, that's not true.
You should have married a barracuda!
All right, all right.
If it will make you happy, I'll take you with me.
Oh I don't want to go!
What is this?
You don't want to go.
You don't want me to go.
What do you want?
I want you to go to the studio party tomorrow night.
Uh-huh.
I knew there was something cooking in that little brain of yours.
Why are you so interested that I go to the studio party tomorrow night?
You want the truth?
That would be refreshing, yes.
The whole truth?
That would be even more refreshing.
I lied.
That sounds like the truth.
I told them that you and I would do an act together.
Oh, no!
Oh, now, Ricky, please!
Oh, no.
I'm going fishing.
But, honey, I already told the studio.
Well, then you will have to tell the studio that you made a mistake.
I will not.
You will, too.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
I can't do that.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Why can't you?
Because that would be lying.
Well, I don't want to hear one more word about it.
Oh, Ricky, now, please!
Let's get out of here.
And miss this?
You stay here for the studio party or you'll be sorry.
Now, Lucy, don't threaten me.
Let go.
No!
Let go!
Oh, Ricky!
Ouch!
Well, it serves you right!
Ricky, talk to me.
Oh Let's go.
Where are you going?
I knew someday he'd go too far.
Oh, this is just a model of Ricky's head he brought home from the studio.
Oh, Lucy, you almost scared me to death with that thing.
It looks exactly like Ricky.
Doesn't it?
Looks so much like him, I'd like to punch it in the nose.
Hey, that's fun!
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, dipsy fishing, huh?
Dipsy fishing.
Yeah.
Ricky, after all I've said, you're still going fishing?
Oh, no, no, honey.
No.
I'm going golfing.
Oh, you're impossible.
No, you're the one who's impossible.
I happen to be very possible.
Well, I got to get going.
Ricky, please?
Nope.
Please do the number with me just this once.
Absolutely not!
Oh!
They're always showing the same old movie on this channel.
Well, so long.
See you in a couple of days.
No, wait.
Fred, in all the years you've been married, have you ever left Ethel alone to go fishing?
Nope.
You see?
He loves his wife.
He's devoted, considerate.
And what's more, he gets seasick.
No, I do not get seasick.
Hah!
He gets queasy if I have too many waves in my hair.
Well, I got to get going.
You think someone would kiss me good-bye.
Well, don't look at me.
See you in a couple of days.
Bye.
Have a good time, Rick.
Good-bye, Rick.
Thank you.
Catch us a fish.
I'll try to get you some.
All right.
Oh some husband I've got.
If my mother wasn't living with us, I'd go home to her.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Call up the studio and tell them you can't make it?
No.
I can make it.
I'll tell them Ricky can't make it.
They won't want you without Ricky.
Why do you say that?
!
Because it's the truth.
Well, I know, but why do you say it?
I got to get an idea.
Okay, we'll leave you here to think.
Come on, Fred.
All right.
Here, Lucy, two heads are better than one.
Oh Lucy?
!
Lucy?
!
Yeah?
What did you want to see us about?
Yeah, I'm eating my lunch.
Oh, I'm sorry, Fred.
Listen, Ethel, turn on that record of Ricky's and sit down, and I have something very important to show you.
What's going on here?
I don't know.
When we are dancing and you're dangerously near me I get ideas I want to hold you so much closer than I dare to I want to scold you 'Cause I care more than I care to And when you touch me And there's a smile in every fac What do you think?
You think it'll work?
Think what'll work?
Well, my dance for the studio club.
Do you think they'll know it's a dummy?
Nobody but the audience.
Aw!
Didn't it fool you at all?
Nope.
The dummy's a better dancer than Ricky.
Oh, Fred!
It fooled me for a couple of seconds.
Did it?
It sure did.
Then I can fool an audience that long.
Now, this is what I want to do.
I want to dance out on the stage with Raggedy Ricky here, I dance around a little bit and then he'll be suddenly taken ill, see, and I'll help him off the stage and I'll come back and finish the number by myself.
You'll never get away with it.
No.
Well, I will if you help me.
Well, so long, Lucy.
Come on, Fred.
Now, Ethel!
I want you to help me.
Not a chance.
Why not, Ethel?
What?
!
Good boy, Fred.
Are you out of your mind?
Now, look, we're going to give in eventually- we always do- and if we say no now, she'll keep us around here arguing all afternoon.
So, why don't we say yes right away and then I can go ahead with my lunch.
Oh, you're absolutely right, Fred!
Now here's what I want to tell you about.
Oh, you can't hear this.
Now, this is ridiculously simple.
All I  Come on in.
Hurry.
Did you have much trouble?
A little.
Well, The guard at the gate wanted to smell his breath, but I talked him out of it.
You know, I'm getting fond of this guy.
Put him right down here.
Okay.
Come on, Esteban.
Thank you very, very much.
Oh, that's beautiful!
Where did you get it?
At a costume company.
The show's starting.
Give me a hand with him.
All right.
Thank you.
We're gonna start the show off tonight with a wonderful surprise.
You know how proud we are that MGM will soon be releasing Samuel Goldwyn's new picture, Guys and Dolls to theaters all over the country.
Guys and Dolls stars Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine.

Good luck.
Gee, I hope this works.
Every producer on the lot is gonna be out there tonight.
You you'll kill 'em.
Let's go stand in the wing.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, one of our newest stars here at MGM- Ricky Ricardo in a special number with his partner, Mrs. Ricardo.
I'm so sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but something seems to be the matter with Mr. Ricardo.
Oh, it's nothing serious.
Don't be alarmed.
In the tradition of our business, though, the show must go on.
So, if you'll excuse me, I'll be right back.
Mrs. Ricardo, if your husband is ill we can cancel the whole thing.
Oh, no, no, the show must go on.
Yes, but Mrs. Ricardo The show must go on!
Hold still.
Get the arm off.
Straighten my mantilla out in the back.
Straighten it way out.
Are you ready?
I got it.
Okay, here I go.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Wait!
Wait.
When we are dancing And you're dangerously near me I get ideas I get ideas I want to hold you so much closer than I dare to What a trooper.
I want to scold you But I care more than I care to And when you touch me And when there's fire in every finger I get ideas And after we have kissed good night And still you linger I kinda think you get ideas, too : Your eyes Your, your, your, your, your, your, your eyes are always saying The things I hope they're saying I only hope they're saying That you would love me, too 'Cause that's the whole idea, it's true The lovely idea That I've fallen in love with you.
Oh, Fred, what are we gonna tell Ricky?
Well, I maintain that honesty is the best policy.
I know, but what are we gonna tell Ricky?
Hi, everybody.
Hi, Rick.
Hi, Rick.
Where's Lucy?
Uh, did you catch a lot of fish?
No, it was too shoppy.
You know, when it's that shoppy, there's not much fish.
Where's Lucy?
Uh, "shoppy," huh?
Oh, yeah, I'm telling you, all the way to Catalina, the boat just roll and roll and roll and roll and then it pitch forward and goes back and it roll and it roll.
I'm telling you, it was terrible.
All the way through.
Hey, Rick, get me off this boat.
: I'm sorry, Fred.
Where's Lucy?
Did she go out?
Oh, uh, she, uh Ethel, where's Lucy?
Ricky, Lucy's got a job.
What?
!
She went to that studio party last night.
Oh, you two were a sensation.
Who two?
You and Lucy.
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute.
I'll show you.
What is she babbling about?
Oh no.
How could she have gotten away with it?
She didn't, but it was such a mess, they thought it was a comedy act and they offered her a year's contract!
That's where she is now, over there talking over terms.
I can't believe it.
Oh, Ricky, you can't let her sign that contract.
She'd have to stay out here a whole year.
She can't do that.
But you can stop her, can't you, Rick?
'Course I stop her.
Huh!
I'll just tell her, "You just can't take this contract.
What do you think, you're gonna " Wait a minute.
I can't stop her.
If I do, she'll throw it in my face for the rest of my life.
He's right.
But you'd better think up something fast.
She'll be home any minute.
Well, let's see I tell you what.
We'll use physiocology.
What?
!
Physiocology.
You know, when you want somebody to do something, you make them think you want them to do something else.
Physicology.
Physicology?
Yes, honey, you know, what a physichiatrist use.
That's a head doctor.
Oh, psychology.
Oh.
All right, have it your own way.
Look, here's what we're gonna do.
When she comes in  I get ideas, I get ideas Follow my lead.
Ethel, I'm gonna sign the contract tomorrow.
Oh, hi, honey.
Hi, there.
Did you hear the news?
Yes, yes.
The Mertzes told me all about it.
Oh.
And I think it's wonderful.
You do?
Yes, I certainly do.
I was afraid you'd be angry with me.
Angry?
Well, honey, why should I be angry?
Just because you took a dummy over to the studio and made him pass as your husband?
: Why, honey that is exactly what any any normal, red-blooded, American girl would have done.
Oh, boy, you must have caught a lot of fish.
No, no, no, I'm sincerely glad.
This is what you've always wanted to do and now you've done it.
Gee, you're really glad, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, Lucy, this is so exciting.
Oh, boy, I can hardly wait till I get my first big picture.
Yeah, well, you'll have to be sure and write to us and tell us all about it.
Oh, don't worry What do you mean, write?
Well, honey, Little Ricky and me and the Mertzes are gonna be back in New York and you'll be out here Oh, no, no, you're all gonna be out here with me.
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't do that.
I have a contract at the Tropicana.
I open there in a couple of weeks.
Oh, we've left our apartment house much too long already.
Yeah, after all, we're still the landlords.
Well, gee, I know, but Now, honey, you cannot let your family and your best friends interfere with your professional career.
Well, I know, but And, besides, it's not like we were gonna be millions of miles away.
You can come and visit us every Christmas.
And you can call us as often as you like.
That's right.
And don't you worry about Little Ricky.
I'll show him your picture every night, so he won't forget his mommy.
Oh, no, no!
I gotta have Little Ricky and all of you out here.
Now, look, Ricky, you can book your band out here someplace, you know that, and if it's a matter of money, I'll be making a large salary.
I'll, I'll pay all your expenses.
Oh, thanks, honey, but I'm afraid not.
Well, now, wait a minute, Ethel.
I'm sorry, I-I'm afraid we can't.
No, no, we really have to go, but that doesn't mean that you have to, you know.
Honey, what's the matter?
You look sad.
We're happy for you.
Yeah.
This is what you've always wanted: a career in show business.
We're really happy for you.
Aren't you happy?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm happy.
I'm very happy I guess.
You can't let your family and best friends interfere with your career.
You can call us as often as you like.
We'll show the baby your picture, so he'll know who his mommy is.
I'm sorry, sir, but I've decided to go home and be with my family.
You're making a big mistake, my dear.
We have great plans for you.
We're certain that you'll be a big star.
Big star.
Oh, yes, yes, I'm Lucy Ricardo.
My autograph?
Of course.
I don't mind.
When people stop asking, that's when I'll mind.
Oh, you're welcome, my dear.
What's that?
Another Oscar?
I'll have to oblige to this.
This is the sixth one.
Uh, the twelfth one.
A call for me?
I'll take it right here on the set.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Little Ricky, honey.
Well, Mommy misses you, too.
Oh, don't cry, sweetie.
Mommy will be home for a whole day at Christmas.
Oh, don't cry, little Ricky, honey.
Don't cry, baby, don't cry.
Oh, Little Ricky!
Baby, Mommy's coming, Mommy's coming!
I'm sorry, baby.
It's all your fault.
It's all your   Honey, I'm sorry.
Ricky, I don't want to stay out here.
I want to be with you and the baby and the Mertzes.
That's my baby.
I don't want to stay out here.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Yeah, I know, Ralph, but I can't sell you the car.
How am I going to get back to New York?
Well, I'll see you at the studio later.
Good-bye.
Who was that, honey?
Ralph Berger.
He fell in love with our car.
He wants to buy it.
You can't sell the car.
How are we gonna get home?
I know.
I told him to forget it.
Oh.
Gee, I wonder what happened to Fred.
What do you mean?
Well, I called him about an hour ago and asked him to go out and buy something for me and he just disappeared.
All he had to do was get a little box of Q-tips.
It shouldn't take him that long.
A box of what?
Q- tips.
You know, these little things I use for the baby.
Oh, oh.
You see the new can that I bought?
The can of shaving lather I just bought?
No, I didn't see it.
Well, it's missing.
And another little item is missing, too.
My safety razor.
The razor I saw.
I took it away from the baby this morning.
There was no Oh.
blade in it, but do you know that he climbed all the way up on the sink to get it?
Now, what did I do with it?
Oh.
Certainly, you didn't put it in your purse.
Well, you never can Oh!
What's the matter?
I think we're closing in on that can of lather.
Oh, get me something to wipe this off with, honey.
Look at this mess.
What that kid won't do.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Uh-oh.
What's the matter?
I found the razor.
: Oh.
How did he ever get that in there?
Here, honey.
Oh, what that kid doesn't get into.
Honestly.
I can't get it out.
How did he put it in there?
It's gonna be an interesting way to shave.
Oh, dear.
Ricky?
Little Ricky?
I want to see you.
Maybe I can shoot my whiskers off.
Oh, no!
What happened?
Let's see what your daddy has to say about this.
Oh, no!
Oh, Ricky!
It's all over everything in there.
Now, you know you shouldn't do that.
Let's wash him off.
I'll wash him off.
Wash him off.
Lucy?
Oh, Lucy?
Here.
Well, what's this?
Well, you wanted cue tips, didn't you?
Yes.
Well, they wouldn't sell me the tips without the cues.
Here, I brought you some chalk, too.
Fred, I think you flipped your lid.
I wanted some of these little things.
What?
!
I'd like to see you shoot pool with a silly, little thing like that.
Oh, Fred.
Tried to do somebody a favor and this is the thanks you get.
Fred, I thought you knew what they were.
I flipped my lid, huh?
Oh heavens.
Well I tried it, but it's impossible.
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm going over to Fred and finish shaving.
Okay.
And maybe I can I'll go over to the studio after that and say good-bye to everybody and then I'll have the car checked.
All right, dear.
Bye.
Oh, gosh.
Lucy, what's going on around here?
Fred's as mad as a hornet and I just passed Ricky in the hall and he's half dressed and bleeding to death.
What are you doing?
I'm just taking some shaving lather out of my purse.
It's a good thing we're gonna go back to New York in a couple of days.
This group is cracking up.
You can say that again.
Hey, Lucy, we're going swimming.
You want to come along?
No.
You go on, I got to get packed.
I got twice as much stuff as I had when we came out here.
Oh.
Where we gonna eat tonight?
Don't you ever think of anything but food?
Ehh.
I've got twice as much Ethel as we had when I come out here.
Oh, Fred, leave her alone.
What do you want to start that for?
Because it's true.
Hello.
Lucy?
Yeah, Ricky.
You're getting big as a barrel.
I am not.
If Route 66 was downhill, I could roll you back to New York.
Oh, I don't think that's very funny.
Wait, ju-just a minute, dear.
Hey, hey, you two.
Please, just a second.
What'd you say, dear?
I was saying that I'm at the studio, and I just sold the car.
What?
How are we gonna get home?
On the train.
Oh.
You know, uh, the fellow I told you about- Ralph Berger- he paid me almost as much as I paid for the car.
And not only that, but by using the, uh, family travel plan, we can make money on the deal.
Well, that sounds great.
Are you gonna be home the rest of the afternoon?
What?
Are you gonna be home?
Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna have the tickets sent over right away.
All right, dear.
Good-bye.
Guess what?
Ricky sold the car.
Sold the car?
What are you talking about?
Some fellow at the studio offered him practically what he paid for it, so he sold it.
Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, yes, that's wonderful.
That's just dandy.
Well, you don't sound very pleased.
I presume when Ricky sold the car, the back seat went with it?
Well, naturally.
What are you getting at?
Well, we were rather attached to that seat.
That's the way we came out here and that's the way we planned on going home.
Is that what you're upset about?
You'd be upset, too, if you just had your back seat shot out from under you.
Oh, Ethel, don't be silly.
We're all going home on the train.
You're going with us.
Who says so?
Ricky says so.
Quote, we're going home on the train, unquote.
You're part of we.
Messenger's on the way over here right now with the tickets.
Yeah, but how many?
One for you, one for Ethel, Ricky, mother and me.
Five.
The baby doesn't need any.
: Oh.
I guess we were a little hasty, honey.
Good old Ricky wouldn't forget us.
Well, of course not.
Gee, the train!
I haven't been on the train since I was a little girl.
Did they have trains then?
Ho-ho.
Gee, won't it be fun?
You know, they have those new dome-liner observation cars and diners on that train.
You can, oh, see the scenery all the way back to New York.
Eat and look out at the same time.
Yeah?
Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes.
Sign here, please.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Here are the tickets.
Uh-huh.
One two three four One, two, three Hmm.
Now, there's just been a mistake.
Yes, and we made it.
Come on, Fred.
Now, Ethel, listen.
Don't go away mad.
Mad?
Whatever gave you the idea we were mad?
Why, we're tickled to death.
I think it's so thoughtful of Ricky to pick such a nice place as California to dump us in!
Oh, Ethel.
Oh Hi, honey.
What's the matter?
You mad because I'm late?
No, I'm not mad because you're late.
Well, did I do something?
You sure did, buster.
What did I did?
Just think back over everything you did this afternoon.
Well, I went to the studio.
I said good-bye to everybody.
I sold the car.
The guy that bought the car drove me home, and oh, yeah, I bought the train tickets.
How many?
Three.
Only three?
Yeah.
The baby doesn't need one.
One for your mother, one for you and one for me.
Oh, no.
The Mertzes.
Oh, yes, the Mertzes.
What's the matter with you, Ricky?
Well, I don't know.
I was busy thinking of that travel family plan and try to save some money and the car They don't know anything about it, do they?
Oh, don't they.
They were right here when the tickets arrived.
Oh, dear.
Are they mad?
Well, let's put it this way: If I were you, I wouldn't walk ahead of them down a dark alley.
Oh, well, now, this changes everything.
You know, using that plan an-and only three tickets, I made money on the deal, but now Well, get them over here.
We'll figure out something.
Well, I should hope so.
I don't know how could you forget them.
Well, honey, I got so many things on my mind.
The band and the whole thing Checked out?
That's impossible.
Oh, no!
She said they checked out.
They're down in the garage right now, she said.
What are they doing in the garage?
They don't have a car.
Maybe they're stealing ours.
We don't have one either.
Oh, well, what's the difference?
Come on.
All right.
Oh, no!
Oh Are you stepping on the right thing?
Yes, I'm stepping on the right thing.
Is that what the man said to step on?
Yes, that's what the man said to step on.
You want to get up here and drive this?
No, I just want to get this thing started.
What do you think you're doing?
Well, what does it look like we're doing?
We're going back to New York.
On a motorcycle?
Yes, on a motorcycle.
Ethel, are you seriously considering going to all the way to New York on a motorcycle?
Well, Fred gave me a choice, and this beats hitchhiking.
Come on, Fred.
Let's go.
Now, wait a minute, Ethel.
We're all going home together.
Ricky said he'd buy the tickets.
Didn't you?
Well, we'll figure out something.
There, you see What do you mean, "Figure out something"?
Give her the gas, Fred.
Get out of the way, Lucy.
Go!
We can talk about it.
Get out of the way.
Fred!
Fred!
Look out, Fred!
Are you all right?
What's the matter?
You step on the wrong gear?
Yes, I step on the wrong gear.
Well, what'd you want to do that for?
Well, I thought it might be fun to back all the way to New York so we could see where we've been.
Oh, I don't think this is any time to be funny, Fred.
All right, all right, Ethel, Ethel, Ethel, the main thing is, you're all right.
That's right, Fred, Ethel.
I'm sorry.
I'll I'll buy the tickets.
There.
That fixes everything.
Oh, Gee, that's great, isn't it Fred?
Fred?
Ricky is spending.
He will pay.
Fred, he said he'd buy the tickets.
What more do you want?
Who's gonna pay for that motorcycle?
!
Oh Well, you certainly don't expect me to.
Oh	 Why not?
If you'd bought tickets in the first place, I wouldn't have to buy the motorcycle in the second place!
you don't even know how to ride!
Oh!
Come in.
Hi.
Where's Ethel?
Well, she took the motorcycle down to have it fixed.
Ethel took it down?
Well, I'd have taken it, but my shoulder is killing me.
Oh.
Besides, she's stronger than I am.
Oh, Fred Well, she is.
Hey, would it help if I rubbed your shoulder a little bit?
Yeah, I guess so.
How's that?
Oh, that feels fine.
Fred Yeah?
I had a long talk with Ricky and he's gonna buy the tickets.
After the fight we had last night?
After the fight you had last night.
Did he say he'd buy 'em?
Well, not exactly, but I could tell by the look on his face.
Oh, sure.
No, now, really, I know him.
Oh  What's the matter, girl?
I pushed that piece of junk to three different places and they can't fix it and they won't buy it.
Wouldn't they give you anything on it?
Yep.
I got this on it.
A parking ticket?
No.
It's for "dumping rubbish within the city limits.
" Ethel, Ricky's going to buy your train tickets.
After the things big mouth said to him last night?
Big mouth?
I suppose I started it?
Oh, now, Fred.
He said he'd buy the tickets.
Why didn't you leave well enough alone?
Why should I get stuck for the price of a motorcycle?
Because you smashed it.
You'd think anybody would have the sense to start it off and drive it in the direction it was pointing in.
Ethel, please.
How did I know it was set in reverse?
If you didn't know All right, all right, all right.
Now wait a minute, Ethel, Ethel, Fred is right.
If Ricky bought the tickets in the first place, there wouldn't have been any motorcycle.
Who asked you?
Well, it's just common sense.
Common sense has nothing to do with it.
When I say he's wrong, he's wrong.
Oh, Ethel.
What are you doing over here anyway?
Massaging his shoulder.
I'll rub it if it needs rubbing.
Since when did you and he get to be such good friends- you taking his side and rubbing his shoulder?
Why, Ethel, what's the matter with you?
Oh we're stuck for the price of a motorcycle and Ricky won't buy those tickets for us in a million years.
Oh, he will, too.
Now, I'll show you how well I know Ricky.
I'll be right back.
Is this the place that's sore?
!
It is now that you've stuck your claws into it.
Here.
Now, here's two of our tickets.
Now, would I be giving you this if I wasn't sure that Ricky was gonna get some more?
We'd be stuck.
Well, that's more like it.
Thanks, Lucy.
Yeah.
'Course I'm still stuck for the price Shut up!
Lucy I'm sorry for what I said.
Oh, honey, that's all right.
I understand.
You were just upset.
That feel good, Fred?
Feels fine now.
Lucy Huh?
I'll do that.
Hi.
What's that for?
I gambled a lot on the sweetness of your character today, Ricky.
Did you get the tickets for the Mertzes?
Yeah, I got the tickets.
Hooray!
You're just wonderful as I thought you were!
Well, I don't know what's going on, but I got the tickets.
Good.
Now I'll tell you what I did today.
'Course I couldn't get them compartments as we have.
But, uh, I got them the best thing I could get, you know- upper berths.
Oh, dear.
Oh, what "Oh, dear" about what?
You think they'll mind sleeping in an upper berth?
No, but you will.
Me?
I won't have to.
Won't you?
No.
I have a compartment.
Have you?
Lucy, are you trying to tell me something?
No, I'm trying to keep from telling you something.
Tell what?
Well, the Mertzes said that you wouldn't buy the tickets.
I said you would.
We got into a big fat argument, and and oh, dear.
And I I gave them two of our tickets.
What?
!
Well, I didn't know the difference!
They were just tickets.
Well, these are just tickets, too.
So, you take them over there and get my compartment back.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Well, upper berths An upper berth is as good as a back seat.
Well, it'll be different if they if they didn't have the tickets already, but to say, "Here, take these.
The good ones are for us.
" I can't do that.
Look, are you gonna do it, or you want me to go over there and tell them?
Well, there must be some other way.
All right, I will.
I'll explain it to them.
Hi.
You get the tickets?
Yeah.
Ethel Oh, Ricky, we ought to be ashamed of ourselves, and we are.
How could we ever forget what a wonderful friend we have in you.
Yeah, well, Ethel And you treat us like this.
The way you treat yourself and your own family.
Well, you know the way I feel about you.
Oh, Ricky, there's nothing two-faced about you.
No.
Oh, you're just wonderful.
You're you're noble.
You know, I was awful upset about those tickets.
Yeah?
I didn't think you were gonna get them.
Oh.
I got so mad, I got mad at Lucy rubbing Fred's shoulders.
: Oh.
She did.
She was so upset, yeah.
: Yeah.
Lucy, I'm going to the drugstore.
You want anything?
No, thanks, dear.
Fred's taking a nap, but he'll be in to thank you just as soon as he wakes up.
Lucy yeah?
Can I trust you to stay away from my husband?
Now what are we gonna do?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
You can all take the tickets.
I'll go home on the motorcycle.
Oh, Ricky, now, don't be silly.
Look, go to the phone, see if they had a cancellation.
I was just there a half an hour ago.
Well, lots can happen in 30 minutes.
Yeah, I'll tell you something that happened in the last 30 minutes: My stomach is all knotted up.
Well, unknot it and go to the phone.
Go on.
Hello.
Give me Union Pacific, please.
How do you like that?
We're stuck being nobble to the Mertzes.
Well, you're the one who was being "nobble.
" Ticket agency, please.
Uh, listen, this is Ricky Ricardo.
Yes, Mr. Ricardo, uh, what can I do for you?
Oh, have you had any cancellations for compartments in th-the dome-liner, city of Los Angeles?
Oh, I'm very sorry, Mr. Ricardo.
The only thing we have left on that train are uppers.
Yeah, well, that's what I was afraid of.
Thank you very much.
If you have any, would you please let me know?
Good-bye.
Nothing.
Yeah Hey!
I just realized something.
Fred put those tickets in his wallet without even looking at them.
He doesn't know whether they're riding in a compartment or a caboose.
So?
If we could just switch his tickets for these without his knowing it.
What made you think that he hasn't opened his wallet and looked at the tickets?
Fred?
Open his wallet?
You're right.
He hasn't seen the tickets.
Now, if we could just think of a sneaky way to make the switch.
Well, that's your department.
You're vice president in charge of sneaky switches.
That's true.
Good luck.
What are you doing?
Uh What are you doing?
Now, Ethel, I can explain.
What's going on?
What are you doing?
What's going on?
I, I, uh, I-I got to thinking, it was sort of our fault that that Fred's shoulder was hurt, so I came down to massage it for him.
Does-does that feel all right, Fred?
That feels fine.
Thanks.
It should.
It was the other shoulder he hurt.
Oh, I I-I thought maybe the pain traveled over to the sort of a sympathetic travel over- no, I guess not.
Well, I'm waiting for an answer.
What was that question again?
What are you doing?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, well, Ethel, I was You see, I was just, uh Not at first, I wasn't.
But there, there's usually there comes a time, you know, when you're absolutely right.
We'll talk about it on the train.
What happened?
You switch the tickets?
Not quite.
What do you mean, "not quite"?
Who's that?
Who's what?
Lucy, I want to talk to you!
Lucy!
The Mertzes!
Don't answer the door.
Maybe they'll go away.
What are you talking about?
Lucy, I want to know what you were doing in our room with your arms around Fred.
So do I. Oh, no!
Oh, I might as well tell you the whole ugly story.
I- I was trying to change the tickets in Fred's wallet for these.
Is that all?
Well, all you had to do was ask.
Well, these are uppers.
Well, that's okay.
Why, sure it is.
Here.
Well, gee, thanks, Fred.
You're welcome.
There you are.
All that trouble for that?
That's fine, Fred.
Thank you.
I'm glad you don't mind.
I didn't know Wait a minute!
These tickets are uppers, too.
I know it.
We didn't need that expensive compartment, so I traded it off for two uppers.
Oh no!
And the difference just paid for the motorcycle.
Asi que de todas maneras yo estoy comprando motocicleta otra vez.
Yeah, I know it.
Hello?
Yes!
Yes, we'll take it, definitely.
Thank you.
They got a cancellation on a compartment.
Oh!
Great!
Hey, that must be the compartment that Fred just turned in.
Yeah, that's right.
That's How do you like that?
I just bought back my own compartment!
Oh, no!
Oh, honey!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Hurry up!
I am hurrying up.
Come on!
Oh, look at this.
I had no idea a train was nice as Oh, Mother, look.
They got the little beds already made up.
Oh, it's a beautiful train.
Come on, I'll take the baby, Micky.
All right, Mother Micky.
Oh, come on, darling.
All right, I mean, I I can't help it.
Come on.
Phew.
Gee, these things are heavy.
Why didn't you let the porter carry them, Fred?
I'll give you three guesses.
I need the exercise.
I'm building up my muscles.
You'd get more exercise if you'd try to pry open that pocketbook of yours.
Aah!
Oh, gee, I'm really on a train.
This is my first train trip, you know.
You're kidding!
No.
No.
She's never been on a train before.
No, of course, I know all about them.
I've seen them in movies and everything.
Which car do the spies usually ride in?
Spies?
Yeah.
This wouldn't by any chance be the Orient Express, would it?
Oh, Lucy.
Gee, I can't believe it.
I'm taking the city of Los Angeles home.
Is that what you've got in these bags?
Oh, Fred Just be joyous.
Have fun.
Are you gonna be all right with those, Fred?
Well, what a silly way to run a train.
What do you mean?
Look: "Danger.
Do not touch.
Emergency brake.
" Well?
Well, don't tell me if there's an emergency, the engineer has to run way back here to stop the train?
No, honey.
They got one of those in every car.
The engineer has his own set of brakes.
Well, I'm awful glad to hear that.
Oh, honey, I can't tell you how happy I am to be going home on a train!
I bet Little Ricky's gonna enjoy it.
Oh, look, I didn't know they had little hallways like this.
I thought they all, they all had compartments that opened on the outside.
That's only in those foreign movies you've been seeing.
Oh!
Well, this is our compartment and Mother must be over here in B. Yeah.
Pardon me.
Oh, yes, of course.
Mother, are you and the baby okay?
What's up, porter?
How soon do we leave?
Right away, sir.
You can set your watch by the domeliner.
Oh, well, that's nice.
Those go in there, please.
Oh, isn't this cute!
Ricky Yeah?
There's a little door that connects the two rooms.
It's just like a little apartment.
Yeah, they think of everything.
Yeah.
Oh.
Pardon me, sir.
Yeah.
Oh, certainly.
Thank you, porter.
Thank you, sir.
Ah, there!
Here they come.
Hey, this is great.
We're in the car right ahead of you.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, we're neighbors.
'Course, we're out of the high-rent district.
Uppers, 12 and 13.
Oh, stop complaining.
The altitude's good for your sinus.
Come on in and sit down.
No, no, no, we're headed for the diner.
There's a car right behind.
The diner so soon?
Guess who's hungry already.
The bottomless pit.
Oh, now, Fred.
I heard they had wonderful food on this train and I want to get in there before it's all gone.
Now, don't worry.
They'll have plenty.
They heard you were coming.
Oh, you're so funny.
Let's go.
We'll see you later.
When we get settled, we'll be up there.
All right.
Gee, they have all the luck.
Their car is right next to the diner.
Well, maybe I can get you an upper right over the stove.
Then you can just let down a basket for your food.
If I wasn't so hungry, I'd slug you.
Try to amuse him, dear.
The crayons are in that little bag, huh.
Ricky?
Yeah, honey?
Are you hungry?
Well Let's go up and join the Mertzes, huh?
All right.
Okay, I-I'll just take for a minute to fix up.
Okay.
Oh, Ricky, now, where's my bag?
You had it.
Mother, is my bag in there?
MRS.
McGILLICUDDY: No, no, dear.
Well, that's funny.
I don't see it here anyplace.
It's all the stuff the porter brought in.
Are you sure it isn't in there?
MRS.
McGILLICUDDY: Well, no, dear, it isn't in here.
Ricky, my bag is gone!
Now, honey, it can't be gone.
It was there a minute ago.
My purse is gone!
Now, let's see.
I had it when I bought the magazines.
It's, uh it's at the newsstand.
The newsstand!
Ricky, go and get it!
I can't go and get it.
The porter said the train is leaving right now.
Ricky, please, please, go get my purse.
Oh, honey, it's silly.
We'll wire them, and they'll send it ahead.
No, Ricky, no!
Go!
Honey, what can be so wonderful about that old bag of yours?
It's got the train tickets in it!
Oh, no!
Yeah!
What's the matter with you?
!
Honey, I'm sorry!
Hurry up!
Oh, please Oh, dear.
Excuse me, lady.
Excuse me, sir.
Oh, I don't know.
I-I-I Honey All visitors off, please.
Wh-What do you mean?
Why do you say that?
Well, the train's about to leave, ma'am.
But it can't leave!
It can't leave!
You tell them to hold the train, porter.
Tell them to hold the train!
I'm sorry, ma'am.
You'll have to speak to the conductor.
We're moving.
Hey, you stop the train!
You have to stop the train.
I'm sorry, madam.
I can't do that.
Stop this train!
Lady, I-I can't stop this train once it's started.
We have rules, you know.
But-but my husband isn't on yet.
Please!
We left him back at the station.
Well, he can take a cab and pick us up at Riverside.
Riverside?
!
Oh, no!
Mother, are you all right?
Well, we're all right.
What was that?
Oh, I-I don't know.
The train just made a slight hesitation.
I'll be right back.
Lucy!
What made the train stop like that?
Gosh, what a jolt.
I didn't get a bite of my food.
What happened?
I stopped the train.
What?
!
Why?
Well, Ricky got off to get my purse and they started without him.
Oh, that's too bad.
Oh, he'll make it.
I hope so.
Eww!
Come on, Fred.
Let's go get out of this food and into something more comfortable.
Well, I sure hope so.
Did you stop this train?
Me?
You.
Well, uh Madam, did you stop this train by pulling that handle?
Well, I didn't do it by dragging my foot!
I told you not to.
And I told you that my husband wasn't on the train yet.
Sheesh!
In the future, madam, would you allow me to decide when and where this train shall stop?
Gladly.
Thank you.
Now, if it meets with your approval, I would like to inform the engineer that he may proceed.
According to our schedule, we are already several minutes la Oh, Ricky, you made it!
Oh, honey thank you.
Yeah, I made it.
What happened?
You look like you ran into something.
I did.
What?
The back of the train.
Honey, why did you do that?
I had just gotten your purse when the train started to leave, so I ran after it.
I was catching up with it and I was just making a flying leap for the back of the train when it stopped and wham, bang!
I ran right into it.
Well, nice to have you aboard, dear.
Why did they stop the train like that anyway?
Well, maybe there was a cow on the tracks.
A cow in Los Angeles?
We haven't gotten out of the city yet.
How can there be a cow?
Now, dear, get washed up.
It's all right, dear.
Mother, are you ready to go and eat?
Oh, dear, the baby's so sleepy.
We'd better stay here.
But will you bring us something?
Oh, sure, dear.
Here, I'll give you the tickets in case the conductor comes by.
I'll bring you a little sandwich or something.
Come on, Ricky.
All right, dear.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Where you going?
To the diner.
You gonna eat again?
What do you mean, "again"?
We didn't get anything to eat.
Our food just came when the train stopped.
Oh.
I got so many mashed potatoes on my shirt, Ethel will never have to starch it again.
Come on.
All right.
You going, too?
Yeah, we're going.
Excuse me.
Excuse us.
Thank you.
May I see your ticket, please?
Oh, oh, yes.
All right.
It's right here.
Thank you.
Why, I'm very sorry, madam, but you're in the wrong compartment.
Well, this says compartment B. Yes, but this calls for compartment B in 107.
This is 108.
Oh, but my daughter and her husband are in that compartment.
Well, I'm very sorry, lady.
I have to go by the tickets.
I'll show you to the other compartment.
Oh, oh, dear.
Oh, oh, Sam!
Yes?
Will you get this luggage?
We'll have to move it down to the next car.
Yes, sir.
Here we go.
Just follow me, please.
Okay.
Oh, my.
Oh, hello, Mr. Estes.
Oh, hi.
Nice to have you aboard.
Thank you.
Your, uh, ticket?
Oh, here you are.
Thank you.
How, uh, how's the jewelry business?
Oh, a very successful trip.
Very successful.
Why well, it must be successful if you have to wear that.
: Oh, I always carry this.
Never had occasion to use it, though.
Good.
Mom.
I Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I must have the wrong car.
I'm sorry.
I I'm sorry, sir, but I left my mother and child in there and I Why, I'm sorry, madam.
There's no one in here but me.
Well, ar-are you sure?
I know that I left them in here.
You see, we're in compartment A and we have the adjoining compartments.
Ma-Ma-Madam, I'm the only one in here.
Wh-Wh-What have you done to my baby?
!
Help!
Well, madam, I Help!
Don't you touch me!
Don't touch me!
Help!
Help!
Conductor!
My mother and child are missing!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Oh, no!
Never mind that!
Arrest that man!
My mother and child are missing!
Oh, your mother and child are in the next car.
Oh.
What what car?
Why?
Why are they in there?
Their tickets call for compartment B but in 107.
Well I only hope they don't run out of food before we run out of clothes.
Yeah.
I have never been so embarrassed in my whole life.
Everybody in the train is talking about the screwy redhead with the itchy trigger finger.
You'd have done the same thing.
He's carrying a gun.
A lot of people carry guns.
You don't.
It's a good thing I don't.
Oh Probably a detective.
No!
No!
No!
That's a criminal type if I ever saw one.
Close-set beady eyes and a weak chin.
Detectives have wide-set eyes and a strong chin.
Oh.
Don't look at me.
My hands are clean.
Oh, this must be Riverside.
Yeah.
Yes?
Police.
Police?
What can I do for you, sir?
Would you mind showing me your identification?
There you are.
Ricky Ricardo!
Well, say, my kids have all your phonograph records.
Well, that's nice.
Thank you.
I'm sorry to bother you, but we've had a big jewel robbery in L.A., and we're checking on all trains, planes and buses going east.
Oh, I see.
Well, uh, I hope you catch your thief.
Thank you, Mr. Ricardo.
Good night, folks.
Good night.
Uh, Mr. Detective, sir.
Yes, ma'am?
Uh, if you're going into the next compartment, be careful.
That man's carrying a gun.
Oh?
Thank you, Mrs. Ricardo.
You're quite welcome, sir.
Police.
Why don't you mind your own business?
I am minding my business as a citizen.
That's terrible.
It sure is.
I can't hear a thing.
Well, we'll hear plenty once the battle starts.
You'd better lie down.
Get out of the range of flying bullets.
That's funny.
That's funny.
He's going off without him.
Why couldn't he see that that man is a criminal?
Well, maybe it's because the detectives' eyes are so far apart and his are so close together.
How can you make jokes?
Aren't you concerned about riding all the way to New York with a criminal in the next compartment that's carrying a gun?
No.
I'm a lot more concerned riding to New York on an empty stomach.
Oh Come on, I'm hungry.
Oh, all right.
Let's go.
Uh, you go ahead, dear.
I want to get my lipstick.
I'll be right along.
All right.
All right, come on in, Miss.
I want to talk to you.
Uh uh some other time.
Hey!
What's the matter?
Ahh!
That man in there is a real jewel thief.
I peeked through the door.
Oh, no.
I peeked through the door and I saw it.
I told you to stay out of it.
He's a real jewel thief.
I saw him.
Now, listen, honey.
I saw a million dollars worth of diamonds in there, honey!
I saw it with my own eyes!
You Listen to me!
He's a jewel thief!
Would you listen to me?
!
Now, look, the police have talked to this man in there.
Now it's the police case.
As far as you're concerned, this is finished.
This is the end, and I don't want you to talk to anybody about it.
Do you understand?
All right.
Especially, I don't want you to tell Ethel about it.
Oh, Ethel.
I'm glad you reminded me not to tell Ethel.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
How have you been?
Oh, wonderful.
Gee.
Aren't there four seats together someplace?
There's two right down there.
You, you and Ricky take those, huh?
Ethel and I want to sit and chat.
All right.
Come on, Rick, let's play some gin rummy.
All right.
I'm sending postcards.
I should do it.
I should Hey.
What?
Don't forget what I told you.
I know, I know.
All right.
What was that all about?
Ricky told me not to tell you something.
Well, you're not gonna let a little thing like that stop you, are you?
Listen, Ethel, if Ricky told me not to tell you something, I'm certainly not gonna.
Good, they're gone.
What is it?
Do you know why that detective got on at Riverside?
No.
I was just dying to ask him.
Why?
He's looking for a big jewel thief from Los Angeles.
Really?
Yes, and I know who it is and what's more, he's aboard this train.
Who is he?
He's the man in the compartment next to ours.
How do you know that?
Well, for one thing, he was carrying a gun, and when I peeked through the door, I saw Lucy, what were you doing peeking through the door?
Do you want to hear this or don't you?
Oh, yes.
All right.
When I peeked through the door, I saw a million dollars worth of diamonds.
Are you sure?
I have never seen more diamonds outside of Tiffany's window.
I'll bet he's the biggest jewel thief in the whole world.
I'll be right back.
Where are you going?
Oh, I left my opal brooch in my overnight bag and I want to get it and pin it to my, uh I want to pin it.
Pardon me, Miss.
I couldn't help overhearing.
Are you sure of what you saw?
Positive.
Good work.
Special agent.
My identification.
Oh, I should have known.
I can tell you fellows miles away.
Now, you say this fellow's in the compartment right next to yours, huh?
Yes, Compartment B, car 108.
Close-set, beady eyes and weak chin.
That's our man all right.
Mm.
We'd better not waste any time.
Come on.
Me?
Well, I need your help in capturing this dangerous criminal.
Oh, well, I Now, look, Miss, I'm not asking you.
This is an order.
Your government needs you.
Yes, sir!
He's right in there.
What are you gonna do, rush him?
No, I don't want any bloodshed.
Oh gee, you fellows are clever.
I'll hide, then I want you to get him into this compartment.
I'll have the drop on him.
Okay.
How am I gonna get him in here?
You're a woman, aren't you?
Yes.
Well?
You mean, lure him in?
Gee, this will look great in my memoirs.
"I was a woman for the FBI".
That's great!
Pretend you're sick.
Sick?
Sure.
Then he'll come in here to help you.
Now, go on.
All right.
I'll pretend I'm sick.
: Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
What's all  Oh!
Oh, boy, you got him.
Oh, look, he's colder than a mackerel.
Good work.
Oh, anything for J. Edgar.
Oh, look.
Let's put the cuffs on him.
Come on, let's put the cuffs on him.
Let's put the cuffs on him.
Hurry up!
Oh, boy!
Come on, let's put the cuffs on him.
You don't need that.
He's unconscious.
Oh, boy, let's put the cuffs on You don't need that.
He's unconscious.
I know.
I made a boo-boo?
He's not the man the police are looking for?
No.
You?
True.
Ew!
For your sake, I'll keep your secret, I promise you.
I can promise you.
Oh, you don't have to promise me anything.
Now, you're the only living person that can identify me.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
We're gonna walk out of here and stop between the next two cars.
What for?
Never mind!
Ah, oh, all right!
Now, remember, I got this gun on you.
Yeah, I'll remember.
All right, come on.
Okay.
Come on.
Move!
Uh, hello!
Oh, good evening.
I'd like you to meet my Shake hands with Mr. J oh!
Oh, that must be the crazy redhead everyone is talking about.
Now, no more funny business, you understand?
I understand oh!
Hello.
Pardon me.
Pardon me.
I beg your pardon.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
I'll tell the conductor.
There's a man!
Lucy!
What are you doing?
He's the real jewel thief, Ricky.
Oh, hon He's got a gun!
He's got a gun!
Put that gun away.
I got him.
Goody.
I just won five dollars from the engineer.
Never mind that, I got the real jewel thief!
This is the guy.
Grab the jewel case.
This is the guy that they were looking for.
That's the real jewel thief.
And in the compartment back there.
I had no idea I caught a real jewel thief.
That was a real jewel thief that I caught.
It wasn't the man that I thought was a jewel thief.
: It was another one and I was this one back in here and all the time, he was a jewel thief.
Say, Mrs. Ricardo, how did you happen to find out this man was a criminal in the first place?
Well, I don't know.
I guess I'm just a natural-born detective.
Uh, that, plus the fact that she's a natural-born snoop.
Oh, you stop!
Say, Mrs. Ricardo, how about one shot there, uh, you holding the emergency handle like you caught the criminal?
Okay, Greg, get this.
Excuse me.
Yes, of course.
Excuse me.
No, no!

Not a bit.
Collect all the rent?
Every penny.
Good girl.
Oh, there's just one thing, Mr. Mertz.
Uh		Yeah?
We had a cold day a couple weeks ago and I turned the furnace on.
Aw, that's all right.
An-and I-I couldn't remember how you told me to turn it off.
You mean that furnace was on for two weeks?
Gangway!
Get out of the way!
Well, gee, isn't that nice of them giving us a party tonight?
Yeah, it is.
A block party, imagine that.
Hey, you know, I think I'll dazzle the whole neighborhood and wear my Don Loper original.
What are you gonna wear?
My Gimbel's basement original.
Oh!
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Mercy, mercy.
I haven't seen so much excitement around here since Lindbergh came home in '27.
I want to thank you very much for cleaning our apartment, Mrs. Trumbull.
Well, it was Oh, shucks.
very nice of you.
Glad to do it.
Okay.
Here's your paper.
Oh, you started our paper again.
Thank you.
No, it wasn't ever stopped.
Oh, no.
Mother forgot.
Well, it's a good thing, too, because I saved them all.
Now you can find out what happened in New York while you were gone.
Oh!
Well, thanks very much.
They have papers in Hollywood, too, you know.
Not the New York Times.
Oh, that's true, that's true.
He fell asleep while I was changing his clothes.
Aw, poor little guy.
He was so tired.
I know.
Oh What's all this?
: Uh, uh, m-m-m-uh Mrs. Trumbull saved all the papers for us, dear.
Wasn't that nice?
Wasn't your mother supposed to Yes, she was, but she didn't and Mrs. Trumbull saved them.
Wasn't that nice, dear?
Oh oh, yeah, yeah, very very nice.
Very nice, Mrs. Trumbull.
Well, Mrs. Trumbull, did anything exciting happen in the apartment house while we were gone?
Mm  Mrs. Trumbull?
Anything wrong, Mrs. Trumbull?
Oh, no, no.
You sure?
No.
It's just that I've never been this close to a movie star before.
: Well You see, I used to be a Rudolph Valentino fan.
Now I'm a Ricky Ricardo fan.
Well, now, Mrs. Trumbull, I am the same guy that I was before I went to Hollywood.
Say, doesn't he have those big shoe-button eyes, though?
Oh, he sure does.
Boy, you could bake bread in here!
Well, I I'll see you tonight at the block party, Rudolph.
Oh, I mean, oh Oh, well.
ETHEL : Isn't she cute?
"Rudolph.
" What happened to her?
The heat got her.
Two weeks in a hot building will do it every time.
Why did she call you Rudolph?
'Cause he looks like a red-nosed reindeer.
No, no.
No.
She thinks he's another Rudolph Valentino.
Hey, Ethel, let's call our of friends and have them come to the party tonight.
I don't want them to miss this.
Okay.
I live here!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Oh!
I thought they were gonna tear Ricky to pieces.
I didn't know he was that important.
Neither did I. Where is he?
We must have left him out in the hall.
Oh!
Oh, you poor thing!
Honey, are you all right?
What's the matter with those people?
Are they crazy or something?
No, no, they just wanted to touch you because you're a movie star.
Yeah.
Where's your coat, honey?
Some woman just ripped it right off my back.
I think Fred finally got it back from her.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
I'll go clean up.
Here, dear.
Yeah.
That's mine, honey.
Thank you.
See you later, Ricky.
Let me in, will you?
This is Fred.
Fred can't get in.
Let me in!
Come on.
Anybody want a souvenir?
What's that?
Well, it's what's left of Ricky's sport coat.
You mean they pulled it right out of your hands?
Well, not exactly.
When I saw which way the wind was blowing, I capitalized on it.
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, I grabbed it and tore it into pieces and sold them for four bits a pop!
Why, Fred, you're kidding.
When it comes to money, he never kids.
Yeah.
See?
Lucy, have you got any old coats or-or stockings or shirts or BVDs of Ricky's?
I- I can handle all the merchandise you can give me.
No, no!
What am I talking about?
I got an old shirt of Ricky's that I've been using for a paint rag.
Oh, Fred, honestly.
Hey, this thing could be bigger than uranium!
Oh		  Well, isn't it wonderful having our own little group together again?
It's so good to have you home, Lucy.
Well, it's wonderful to see all of you, and I'll bet you're just dying to hear about our trip.
Well, it was just fabulous.
Did Ricky really hobnob with the stars?
Oh, yes, we all hobnobbed.
We hobbed with every nob that was worth hobbing with.
It was just fabulous.
Right after we checked into our palatial suite at the Beverly Palms Hotel, we all decided to go out to lunch.
So, we all trooped over to the Derby.
Oh, you probably know it as the Brown Derby, but us show folk who eat there all the time, we just call it the Derby.
So as I was saying, we wanted some lunch, so we went over to the Derby and we sat in a booth.
Uh, let's see now, you were on the outside, Fred was in the middle, I was on this side, and we had Wasn't Ricky with you?
How's that?
Wasn't Ricky with you?
No, no.
As I was saying, we'd only been there about five minutes when who Where was Ricky?
Wh-What was that, dear?
Where was Ricky?
Oh, I don't know.
He was at MGM, I guess.
Oh, MGM!
Meanwhile Meanwhile!
Meanwhile, in another part of town, we were having lunch at the Derby and, as I was saying, we'd only been there about five minutes and who  Hi, everybody.
Ah, here's Ricky!
How was your trip, Ricky?

A musical, yeah.
Did you have did you have a lot of big love scenes in it?
Yes, he did.
I'll tell you all about it, Mrs. Trumbull.
I'll tell you all about all the love scenes.
The funniest thing that happened is, uh when I met Bill Holden, you know.
Oh, I I I know Bill Holden!
I know Bill Holden.
I know, I know  Roy, Roy, I knew Bill Holden.
I know Roy, Roy, I know I knew Bill Holden.
dropped this thing on me.
And all of a sudden, I looked around, I said, "Who do you think the waiter was"?
Bill Holden!
We were there, too.
We have stories to tell.
Yeah, yeah.
Ricky?
Yeah?
Ricky?
Tell them about Richard Widmark.
Richard Widmark.
Yeah.
Nobody tells it like Ricky does.
Tell them, tell them.
No, Richard Widmark is my story.
We had lunch Ferino's one day, you know, and, uh Here, this is a Richard Widmark grapefruit.
I got this grapefruit myself After that, we went over to the house out of his backyard.
He has all these wonderful heads and things.
It says Richard Widmark right here.
Of course, it's all very beautiful.
Beautiful big dogs right there.
He's really a wonderful guy, you know.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Is he awake yet?
Who?
Ricky.
We were gonna vacuum the hall, but we don't want to bother him.
Oh, go ahead, vacuum.
No, no, no, no, we don't want to wake him up.
Oh, we wouldn't do anything that would disturb him.
What's the matter with you two?
I can understand those people last night, but why are you treating Ricky like he was made of cake or something?
Oh, Lucy, he doesn't belong to us anymore.
He belongs to the world.
He's not an ordinary person.
He's a great big movie star.
Oh, movie star, phooey!
Lucy, you go wash your mouth out with soap.
Oh, Ethel.
What's the matter with you two?
Hi.
Good morning, Ricky.

Check on some uniforms.
See you later.
Okay.
Good-bye, Ricky.
Good-bye, Fred.
I'm going to be right back, Fred.
I hope so.
Well, I'm disappointed in you.
Why?
What do you mean?
Letting him walk.
Aren't you afraid he'll get the soles of his shoes dirty?
I'm surprised you didn't pick him up and carry him all the way downtown.
Really!
Well, it's Well It's different now.
Oh Yeah.
different.
Hello?

Well, I thought this was the Lucy Ricardo story.
Oh, it is- uh, from the time you met him.
Well, I had a very exciting life before I met him.
I'm sure you did, my dear, but you are only interesting to my readers as you reflect him.
Well, I thought you wanted to know something about her.
Mrs. Ricardo, my dear, you obviously don't know what your husband really means to every one of the 160 million people in the United States.
and they would all love to be in your shoes.
Well, I-I don't understand.
Ricky went to Hollywood and made one picture, came back here, and suddenly the whole world is all Yes.
And they, and they'd all like to be in my shoes?
That's right.
And I am one of them.
Mrs. Ricardo, my dear.
What?
You have been chosen for a very important task in life.
I have?
Why, certainly.
It's up to you and you alone to make Ricky Ricardo happy.
You must see that his every wish is fulfilled, that his every waking hour is filled with happiness due to your love and devotion.
Why, Ricky Ricardo is no ordinary man.
He's something special.
Give him the attention he deserves.
Make him happy!
I will!
I will!
Yours is a sacred trust.
Don't worry, I won't goof.
Now I must be going.
Well, what about your story?
I have my story, and to think that it happened right here before my very eyes- the regeneration of a woman's character.
easier on their tear-stained pillows when they have read my article "Now I Am His Slave By Lucy Ricardo.
"  Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Hi.
A big crowd out in front, so Fred snuck me through the back.
Paper here, honey?
Paper?
Yes, I'll get it.
Oh, you sit down, dear.
You sit down.
Lucy, is something wrong?
Are you sure?
Everything's wonderful.
Hi!
Oh, good morning, Fred.
You got any more Ricky souvenirs for me?
No.
You picked me clean yesterday.
What smells so good?
Are you roasting another pig?
Yep.
Ricky's favorite food, and that's what Ricky's gonna get.
Mmm-hmm, that's what you ought to give him.
What are you doing, shining his shoes?
I certainly am.
He likes to be able to see his face in them, and so I shine them myself.
Oh.
Good morning.
Oh, hi, Rick, old pal.
Morning, darling.
Good morning.
There you are, sweetheart, and there's your orange juice.
No seeds.
All gone.
All gone.
That's it.
Here we are.
Want to close that, Fred, please?
Sure.
Here we are, darling.
I want you to eat.
Here we are.
Here we are, sweetheart.
You gonna watch the football game on television today?
Well, I I'd love to, Fred, but I have to go to Tropicana and get some music.
Oh, now, darling, you stay right here and watch that football game.
I'll go down and get your music for you.
Oh, honey, Tropicana's way downtown.
Now, there's nothing I'd rather do.
Now, Lucy Now, not another word.
I'll go right now, darling.
I don't mind at all.
Is there anything else I can get you while I'm downtown, dear?
No, no, nothing at all, honey.
Nothing?
All right, sweetheart.
Well, I don't get it.
I don't get it at all.
Why is everybody treating me like I was a perfect stranger- even you.
Have I changed?
Nope.
Then why is everybody treating me like I was something special?
Well, I don't know about the rest of them, but I got a pretty good gimmick going for me here, and I I don't want to louse it up.
Well, I should have known you had some kind of an angle.
But what about her?
She shines my shoes, she answers my fan mail, sh-sh-she runs all my errands.
She follows me around like a, like a little puppy.
She thinks I'm a She's treating me as if I was a big movie star.
I want to be treated like a husband.
What an awful thing to say.
Now, look, Fred, I got to snap her out of it.
You got any ideas?
Nope.
Getting Ethel to stop being nice to me is a problem I've never had to face.
Well, you wouldn't like it any more than I do.
Well, maybe Lucy will get tired of it.
I hope so.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I can help her get tired of it.
What do you mean?
Well, she wants to do things for me, right?
Yeah.
I'll give her things to do.
Mm-hmm.
She thinks I'm a big movie star, right?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I am going to become the biggest and most revolting movie star she has ever seen.
Ricky, I got your music, honey!
Where are you?
Coming!
Lucy, where have you been?
I have been dying for a cigarette.
Oh, uh I'm sorry, dear.
I I'm sorry I took so long.
There you are.
Traffic was terrible.
Really- an hour and a half.
Well, I'm sorry, dear.
My shoes shined?
What?
Are my shoes shined?
Oh, yes yes.
I'll get them, dear.
Here they are.
See?
There they are, Mm-hmm.
sweetheart.
I can't be bothered with this music and lyrics all mixed up together.
Type up the lyrics all by themselves, please.
Yes, sir- I mean, certainly, dear.
Thank you.
Right now, please.
Lucy?
Yes, dear?
You didn't shine these shoes, did you?
Oh, yes, I did, dear.
Why?
Is something wrong?
Well, I can't see my face in it.
You can't?
Well, I saw mine.
Yeah, there I am.
See?
Is it too much to ask that one's shoes be shined properly?
No, dear.
No.
Gladly.
Thank you.
The lyrics.
Don't forget the lyrics, please.
No.
Right now?
Yes, please, immediately.
How about the shoes, Lucy?
I'm waiting for the shoes.
Well, honey, I'm typing.
Well, you have two hands, haven't you?
Well, yeah, that's true.
Well?
Oh.
Hello?
Yes, this is the Ricky Ricardo residence.
Yes, I'll hang on.
Uh, Lucy?
Yes, dear?
My cigarette ashes are about to fall off.
Well, honey, there's a there's an ashtray right there.
I don't seem to be able to reach it.
Well, neither can I. Well, uh, what do you want me to do with them?
I don't care what you do with them!
And I don't care whether your shoes are shined or not!
And I don't care about your typing!
And you can take care of your own music!
Is that so?
!
Yes, that's so!
What do you think of that?
!
And I'm not gonna lift a little finger to help you anymore!
You can answer your own phone shine your own shoes, type your own lyrics, light your own cigarettes and knock off your own ashes!
And if you want another roast pig, you can crawl in the oven yourself, you big ham!
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
What do you think of that?
!
I think it's just great!
I don't care what you think.
You think it's just great?
Yeah!
You think I want to be treated like a star, "dun't" you?
Well, "dun't" you?
No, I don't.
Well, then, what are you doing all that stuff for?
I just wanted to make you mad enough so you'd start fighting back.
: Well oh Ricky!
That that Nancy Graham said that I should fulfill your every wish.
Well, you been fulfilling my every wish for 15 years, sweetheart.
Oh, honey.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Going to go to the movies?
Oh, no, thanks, we can't.
No, I have a business appointment.
Guess what, he signed with Associated Artists today.
Who are they?
"Who are they"?
Ha!
Just the biggest talent agency in the business, that's all.
Oh, Rick, that's great.
Well, congratulations, Rick.
You know, the funny part about that is, before I went to Hollywood, I couldn't get in the front door of their office.
And since I come back, they came after me.
Well, a trip to Hollywood sort of made celebrities out of all of us.
I'm a very important person since we came home.
Really?
Yes, sir.
Nowadays when I go to the meat market and order hamburger, the butcher grinds it right in front of my eyes.
Yeah, you know, if I wanted to go to the store without collecting a crowd, I'd have to wear dark glasses and walk down an alley.
Well, that's a lot of trouble, isn't it?
I don't know.
I haven't tried it yet.
Hey, that must be Johnny.
Oh, we'll duck out.
No, stick around.
Stick around.
I'd like you to meet him.
All right, okay.
Hello, Johnny.
Ah, Rick, buddy, how are you?
Johnny, I want you to meet my wife Lucy.
How do you do, Mr. Clark?
Hello, Lucy, how are you?
These are my friends Fred and Ethel Mertz.
Mrs. Mertz,	 Hello, how are you?
Mr. Clark.
Mr. Mertz.
Hi, Mr. Clark.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I was having dinner with Bing, and we had a few problems we had to iron out.
Oh, uh, Mr. Clark, pardon me, but when you left him, did you shake hands with him?
Yes.
Ethel, I just shook the hand that shook the hand of Bing Crosby.
I shook it, too.
Well, I was first.
You were a whole hand later.
Sit down, Johnny.
You must forgive Lucy.
She's a little star-struck.
Star struck?
Well, you'd better get over that, Lucy, because before long, your husband is going to be one of the biggest stars this country has ever known.
Really?
Absolutely.
Well, gee.
Sit down, John.
I saw Dick and Oscar at the Stork tonight.
They're considering you for their new show.
Oh, no kidding.
Yeah, and I think I've got you planted on the Ed Sullivan Show for next month.
No kidding.
Boy.
And Ed Warren wants you on his Face To Face TV show.
Ed Warren?
!
Yeah.
You mean, millions of people will be seeing us right here in our own home?
That's right.
Oh, gosh!
Oh, isn't that wonderful!
Honey!
Honey!
Yeah?
We're not on tonight.
I'll tell you in plenty of time.
Oh, well, that's good, because I want to get new draperies, slipcover all the furniture and we'd better repaint the apartment.
No, that won't be necessary, Mrs. Ricardo.
Well, I just want everything to look nice and cheery.
Well, it's gonna take more than a coat of paint to make this dump look like anything.
Ricky, you can't be seen on Face To Face in a, in a crummy joint like this.
Now, uh, wait a minute now, Johnny.
I forgot to mention something about the Mertzes.
Yeah, we own this crummy joint.
Well, listen, there's no offense.
It's just that we're building Ricky up as a colorful, exciting, new personality, and he's got to live like a star should.
You know, in some place like well, like a Park Avenue apartment.
Penthouse even.
Here, I, uh, I brought along some apartment house brochures.
Well, look them over.
Well, I like it here.
So do I. I'll have you know that this is one of the finest apartment buildings in New York.
If not the finest.
These walls are solid.
Fred.
Solid as a rock.
They don't build them like this anymore.
No, they haven't built them like this for a hundred years.
Now, just a minute, Johnny.
The Mertzes are our best friends and we've lived in this apartment for and we're gonna stay right here.
I didn't mean anything, Ricky, and I'm sorry if I offended anyone.
It's just that I'm thinking about your career.
He can have just as big a career living here as he can in some Park Avenue penthouse.
That's right.
All right, all right.
Have it your own way.
I'll see if I can't get another angle on that Ed Warren show and call you in the morning.
Okay.
Good night, Lucy.
Good night, Mr. Clark.
Good-bye.
Gee, I'm I'm sorry, Fred.
Oh, that's all right.
This apartment has been insulted by bigger men than him.
Yeah, building inspectors.
Imagine us living in a big, fancy apartment.
I like it here.
So do I. Don't you worry, Fred.
We're never gonna leave this crummy joint.
Oh!
We're not worried about that.
We're going to the movies.
We'll run along.
See you tomorrow.
Okay, good-bye.
Okay.
Don't forget- tomorrow night we play bridge, huh?
All right, see you later.
We won't.
I'm not sure I like your new agent.
Oh, honey, he doesn't know any better.
Us in a Park Avenue penthouse.
Sheesh!
"Four bedrooms, four bathrooms and a library.
" What would we do with all that room?
Hmm.
"Private terrace.
" Hmm.
Well, that would be nice for little Ricky.
"Daily maid service.
" Whoa.
How much do they want for all that swank?
They start at $11,000 a year!
For us they end there, too.
I'll say.
Hoo-hoo.
I would kind of like to take a look at one just to see what it's like inside, you know?
Just forget it.
Yeah.
Hi, honey.
Well, hi.
Where have you been?
It's after 8:00.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Rehearsing a new show, you know, takes a lot of time.
Yeah.
You have any dinner?
Yeah, I had a bite at the club.
Hey, guess what I did today?
What?
I looked at one of those Park Avenue penthouses.
I just wanted to see what it looked like.
It was a $11,000 humdinger.
Boy, you should have seen it.
A tremendous living room, view of Central Park and the softest carpet.
They were this thick.
I didn't see my feet for half an hour.
Made this place look like the city dump.
Now, Lucy Relax.
I found out a terrible thing.
It wasn't comfortable over there.
I guess I'm the city-dump type.
Well, my pocketbook thanks you.
I must have looked like the city-dump type, too.
Mrs. Skyler- she's the manager over there- she wasn't even gonna show me the place until I told her who you were.
I'll tell Fred and Ethel you're here.
Okay, I'll clean up.
I'll be right out.
Okay, fine.
We'll be right over.
Ricky's home.
Let's go over and play some bridge.
Well, come on, what's the matter with you?
Oh, I was just thinking about last night and how Lucy and Ricky told his agent they'd never move out of here.
They're such wonderful people.
Yeah, you're right.
They really are.
They're the kind of people that give people a good name.
They're the best friends we ever had.
That's for sure.
We got to get them out of here.
Yep, we got to What?
!
We got to make them move out of here.
And lose perfectly good tenants?
Oh, now, Fred, for once, will you think with your heart instead of your wallet?
I don't know what you're talking about.
They don't want to move.
Sure they do, and they should, but they don't want to hurt our feelings.
We can't let friendship stand in the way of Ricky's career.
He doesn't belong in a place like this.
He belongs in a big, beautiful, wonderful apartment.
You know, you're right, but how are we gonna get them to move?
Well, we'll have to be subtle about it so they won't catch on.
Yeah.
We can burn the building down.
Fred, are you crazy?
No, I'm insured.
Oh, Fred.
Now, let's see.
How does a landlord get a tenant to move out?
Well, suppose we give them a lot of bad service- no heat, no repairs.
Think that'll work?
It hasn't for 15 years.
No, we got to think of something else.
How about, uh Well, we could pick a fight.
What, what about?
Well, we could pick one about, um, about the bridge game.
You know how sensitive Lucy is about her bridge playing.
Good.
Come on.
Now, Fred, Fred, don't weaken.
Remember, it's all for friendship.
Okay, come on.
What's keeping them?
Whoa, since when do you knock?
Hi.
Sorry I was late.
Come on, let's get going.
Hurry up.
Sit down.
Come on, sit down.
Come on.
No, we just came over to tell you not to count on us for bridge.
Uh, yes, uh, we've made other plans.
Well, how come?
You know this is our regular bridge night.
Well, maybe it's time for a change.
What do you mean?
Well, I guess you'd better come right out and tell them the truth.
The fact of the matter is, we don't want to play bridge with you anymore.
What?
!
Why not?
Well, to put it as charitably as possible and not wanting to hurt anyone's feelings, you are lousy bridge players.
Now, just a minute!
Oh, now, Ricky, you're not so bad, but there's some excuse for you: You learned how to play in Cuba.
But Lucy- whee!
She may bring back mah-jongg.
Look who's talking- the queen of the ace trumpers!
Well, if you want to get nasty about it, I thought we knew each other well enough to be honest.
Oh, well, if you want to get honest, let's go.
I've got plenty of ammunition.
You are possibly one of the worst Now, just-just wait-wait-wait, wait-wait a minute, wait a minute.
Why don't you put your money where your big mouth is?
Why don't you stay and play for money?
Real money.
Ha!
Fred play for money?
I'm not the cheapskate in this group.
Meaning I?
Meaning you!
You're tighter than the skin on your congo drum.
Now, now, now, now, don't bug your eyes out at me.
Save that for your movie fans if you have any.
This is the thanks we get for sticking it out for 15 long years in this termite-ridden deep freeze.
If you don't like it here, nobody is twisting your arm.
Yeah, go ahead.
Go ahead and what?
Go ahead and move out.
Well, that's all we had to hear.
That's just what we're going to do!
Good riddance.
And the sooner the better.
Don't worry, we're getting out of this tenement before it's condemned by the Board of Health.
Good, and you can't make it soon enough for us.
That's right!
Ha!
Oh!
I'm going to start packing right this minute.
Oh, no, you're not.
Why not?
Those two crazy, wonderful people.
What are you talking?
What-what-what, what's You deserting to the enemy?
No, honey.
Don't you see?
They were acting like that because they love us.
Well, I'd hate to think how they'd act if they couldn't stand us.
Now, honey, they think that if I stay here, it's going to ruin my career.
Oh.
Sure.
So they, they, they acted like that so we'd pick a fight and move to one of those fancy apartments that my agent was talking about.
Oh, Ricky, you're right.
When did you catch on?
Listen, any time that Fred Mertz tells one of his steady-paying tenants to move out, there's something fishy somewhere.
Oh, Ricky, they're so Oh, I could just cry.
Boy, I'll bet they'll move out tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
They may even go tonight.
Yeah, they might.
Did you see Lucy's face when I told her what a horrible bridge player she was?
Did you hear Ricky when I told him what a cheapskate he is?
: Yeah.
: Oh, I miss them already!
Yeah, me, too.
Now now we'll have to get somebody else to play bridge with us.
Yeah, and the way we play, that's not gonna be easy.
No, it's not.
What's your Aunt Martha's phone number?
Gramercy 3-8-0-9-8.
What are you calling Aunt Martha for?
Well, she always wanted to rent an apartment in our building, and I thought we might let them have the Ricardos' apartment.
Fred, how can you think of money at a time like this?
!
In my sorrow, do I know what I'm doing?
Hello?
I'll take it.
Hello, Aunt Martha?
This is little Ethel.
Listen, do you and Uncle Elmo still want an apartment in our building?
I think we're going to have a vacancy.
The Ricardos.
Well, they haven't told us the exact date, but I could let you know.
Oh, that's nice.
Okay, I'll call you, Aunt Martha.
Bye.
She'll take it.
That's fine.
I miss Lucy already!
Oh, now, honeybunch, don't start crying.
She's the best friend I ever had.
Now, come on, honey, snap out of it.
Come on.
Oh, I can't help it.
That's the nicest thing anybody ever did for anybody.
I know, I know.
Look, we'll just go over there and we'll tell them that we appreciate what they're trying to do, but that we're not going to move.
Oh, honey, we can't do that.
They mustn't know that we know what they're trying to do.
I guess you're right.
Well, I'll tell you what.
Look, I'll, I'll apologize for starting the fight.
I'll tell them it's all my fault.
Well, all right, and I'll tell them that I'm gonna start taking bridge lessons.
Hey, that's good.
Okay.
Come on, let's go.
Hello?
Oh, yes.
How are you?
It's Ethel's Aunt Martha.
Oh, uh Well, just a minute.
How tall are you?
Well, yes, he fits in it.
Fits in what?
Oh?
Oh.
Well, uh, we don't know the exact date, but it's gonna be much sooner than they expected.
Yes.
Well, we'll let you know.
All right.
Good-bye.
How do you like that?
!
What?
Aunt Martha wanted to know how tall you were so she could tell if Uncle Elmo would fit into our bathtub.
Huh?
The Mertzes have already rented this apartment to them.
Well, I'll be darned.
They knew what they were doing right along.
They had already rented this place!
How do you like that?
Iy mira que creyendo lo que fuera mejor amigo mio!
Yeah.
Oh, come on, Ethel, snap out of it.
We did what we had to do and that's that.
Hello.
Yes, this is Mrs. Mertz.
Mrs. Skyler?
Uh, yes, the Ricardos have lived in our building for 15 years.
Yes, they've been very good tenants.
Oh, she did?
!
Oh, it is?
Yes.
Yes, I can recommend them very highly.
You're welcome.
Well!
Who was that?
That was a Mrs. Skyler, the manager of a Park Avenue apartment building.
What did she want?
Lucy was over there today looking at an apartment.
What?
!
Oh, boy they planned to move out all the time.
They just pretended they didn't want to leave here.
Those dirty double-crossers.
I ought to go right over there and blacken one of those bugged-out eyes of Ricky's.
Let's go over there tell them what we really think of them.
Come on.
Hi.
That agent.
Say, I'm glad I bumped into you two.
I was just on my way over to the Ricardos'.
Ed Warren says it's fine to do the show from here.
From this crummy joint?
Well, now, please, I apologize for that.
Now, we have a new angle.
Instead of Ricky living in a fancy apartment, we're gonna show how success hasn't changed him- how even though he's a big star, he refuses to move from his simple and comfortable, old apartment- and his two best friends, the Mertzes.
You're both gonna be on the show with him.
That's all very interesting.
It's at 8:00 tomorrow night.
The only reason we got on is 'cause somebody canceled.
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Clark, but I wouldn't be on a show with them.
Now just a minute, Ethel.
You tell the Ricardos we'll do it.
Okay.
Fred, what's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
How many chances do we get to be on Face to Face?
Besides, who am I to deny 50 million people the opportunity of seeing Fred Mertz?
And his wife.
Well And what about the advertising for the building?
I bet we could get double rentals for every apartment in the house.
Fred, I'll say this for you: You never hold a grudge.
Thanks.
If there's money involved.
Nothing doing, Johnny.
We just don't want to do a television show with the Mertzes.
But, Ricky Look, if they want to go on television, let them go on with Aunt Martha and Uncle Elmo.
Yeah.
Aunt Martha and Uncle Elmo?
What's that, a kid's show or something?
Never mind.
We just don't want to do a television show with them.
But it's all set.
Ed Warren expects them on the show.
You've got to do it with them.
I don't got to do nothing!
Now, listen, Ricky, I've got a lot of important people out there tomorrow night watching you.
Dick and Oscar- they want to hear you sing.
Ed Sullivan.
Well Look, honey, if it's important to your career, I guess we can stomach the Mertzes for half an hour.
After all, we never have to see them again once the show is over.
I guess you're right.
Good.
Then it's all settled.
I'll see you tomorrow night, Rick.
All right.
That a boy.
Now, don't be nervous, Ricky.
Just-just pretend like it's just any other night in your living room.
Well, hold on.
Hey, these, these chocolates, they look terrible.
I think the light is melting them.
I'd better go change them, huh?
No, no, no.
We don't have time.
Nobody will see them.
I'd better get out of here.
I'll go over to the Mertzes and watch it on their TV set.
Okay.
Did you call us?
No.
It isn't time.
Get back.
Get back.
Good luck, kids.
Good luck.
Are you nervous?
No.
Oh.
Hello, Ed.
Honey, we're not on yet.
I know.
I'm just rehearsing.
Oh.
Oh oh, hi, Ed.
Mm.
Oh.
Oh, hello, Ed.
Oh.
Oh, Ed.
How are you?
Five seconds.
Oh.
Lucy Hi, Ed!
No, honey And here we go!
And here is Edward Warren.
Currently, making feminine hearts flutter all across the country is a charming Cuban named Ricky Ricardo.
He recently made his first Hollywood film and out there they are calling him a second Valentino.
Ricky lives with his charming, red-haired wife in this converted brownstone apartment house on East 68th Street.
Hello, Ricky.
Hello, Ed.
Ed, I'd like you to meet my wife, Lucy.
Oh hello, Ed.
Hello there, Lucy.
Ricky.
Yes, Ed?
Ricky, now that you have made that picture, your career is really zooming, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
It's been wonderful.
A lot of wonderful things have happened in the past few months.
How did you find Hollywood?
Huh?
I say, how did you find Hollywood?
Oh, Hollywood was wonderful.
It was really great.
You know, I I'd been working in in nightclubs, you know, for the past few years.
It was different, you know, working without an audience.
Uh, Ricky, do you like working to an audience better?
Well, I don't know if I like it better or not.
It's just that it's different, you know, and then, of course, when you when you go to the preview and and there it is, and there's nothing you can do about it, you know?
I imagine I imagine that that preview was pretty exciting for everybody concerned.
How about that, Mrs. Ricardo?
What?
I- I say I say, the preview must have been pretty exciting for everybody.
Yes, it was very exciting, Ed.
We can hardly wait for : going to a preview.
We're very excited and we can hardly wait for the picture to open.
Neither can I. Ricky, I understand that-that you have an unusual situation in that you are best friends with your landlords.
Oh, yes.
Fred and Ethel Mertz.
They're our very best friends.
Would you like to meet them?
Yes, Ricky, I would.
All right.
I'll see if I can get them.
Fred and Eth!
Ed, this is Fred and Ethel Mertz.
Hello, Ed.
I'm Ethel.
Hello, Ethel.
Hi there.
Hi there, all my pals out in Steubenville, Ohio.
Hi, you guys down in Joe and Bill's Barber Shop, hi.
Fred, Fred ain't this something?
He's not used to these things.
Ricky.
Yes?
I hope you won't mind my telling this, but I understand from your agent that he wanted you to move into a swanky penthouse, but you refused.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
We've lived here for 15 years and we wouldn't move for anything in the world.
Anything wrong, Ethel?
I found that hard to swallow.
Well, Fred, Fred Ricky's attitude must make you very happy.
It certainly does, and we hope they never leave.
That's wonderful.
He'd be a fool if he did.
He's getting reasonable rent and a wonderful apartment and plenty of service and- oh, by the way, if any of you folks out there need a good apartment, just give me a ring.
Ricky Ricky Yes, Ed?
How about a song?
Oh, I'd like Sure, very happy to.
It's right back there.
All right.
If my friends here would help me out with it we'd like to do it like we do in our pleasant musical evenings at home.
You ready?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
We'll do "Rancho Grande.
" Here we go.
Alla en el rancho grande Alla donde vivia Yeeha!
Ooh-hoo!
Yeeha!
Pretty sneaky advertising on Ricky's program.
Habia una rancherita que alegre me decia Que alegre me decia Yoo-hoo!

Not much.
She wasn't!
Ha!
What do you mean, "ha"?
Just what I said- ha!
Aunt Martha called.
We found out the apartment was rented right from under us!
I didn't call Aunt Martha until you said you were leaving.
Vienen aqui, estan preteniendo She said she didn't call Aunt Martha until we said we were leaving.
Didn't you want us to leave?
No, we didn't want you to leave.
We don't ever want you to leave here.
Well, honey, we didn't want to leave, either.
I wouldn't be happy with anybody else.
Lucy Lucy Oh, oh, Ethel  Oh, Ricky Ricky Rick Oh, oh, Fred I don't want to go anyplace.
Fred Lu Lucy Fred  I want to be here for the rest of my life.
Good night and good luck.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
What you doing, honey?
Filling out my 'gagement book.
Your 'gagement book?
Mm-hmm.
Let me see it.
Look at all those 'gagements.
I hope you left some time for me.
Oh, sure, honey.
I wouldn't forget you.
See?
Let me see.
Right here.
"February 2".
"Kiss Lucy.
" February 2 happens to be Groundhog Day.
Did you ever kiss a groundhog?
No.
Hey, I didn't know what I was missing.
Oh, fine.
I'm going to get back in my hole.
I'll see you in February.
Hi, Rick.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
How you feeling?
Fine, thanks.
Everything's going all right, huh?
Great.
Thanks, Fred.
How's Lucy?
She's fine, Fred.
She's in there with little Ricky.
Oh, yeah?
What's on your mind, Fred?
Mind?
Well, nothing.
Oh, Fred, go ahead and ask him.
Oh, now, wait a minute, Ethel.
Just hold your horses.
I know how busy you are, Rick, and I've been telling the fellas down at my lodge just what a good friend of mine you are.
And well well, you are.
There ain't many guys as nice as you.
Oh, boy.
You're a prince!
Fred, what do you want?
What do you mean what do I want?
Oh, Fred, he has to put on a show for his lodge, and he wants to know if you'll be in it for him.
Why, sure, Fred, I'd love to.
You see, Ethel?
I told you all I had to do was ask him.
Oh, fine.
Oh, boy, what a feather in my cap.
At the election, I'll be a cinch for sergeant at arms.
What night is it?
Uh, next Friday.
Oh, I'm sorry, Fred.
I can't do it next Friday.
Oh, you're sure?
Yeah.
I'd rather do your show, but, you see, I'm I'm booked to do a radio program that night.
Oh, well, it looks like he won't be the next sergeant at arms.
Well, doggone, I'm not gonna be flag-bearer again.
I doubt if they'll want you to be flag-bearer again with that pot.
The last time they marched down Fifth Avenue, the flag was two blocks ahead of the parade.
Aah!
Can't you get out of it, Rick?
Yeah, I wish I could, Fred, but I can't.
It's a commitment.
Now what am I gonna do?
I got to put a show together.
Oh, I wish I could help you out.
Did I hear someone say that they had to get a show together?
Lucy, you were way out in Little Ricky's room.
How did you hear him say that?
Listen, when it comes to hearing about show business, Lucy has a special sense- something that the Navy later developed and called radar.
Oh How about it, Fred, you need some talent in the show, huh?
Can I be in it?
Now, wait, wait a minute.
Can I?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, will you?
Let me get comfortable.
I'm going to enjoy watching this happening to somebody else.
Go on.
Oh!
Go ahead!
Can I, Fred, Can I be in the show, please?
Will you be quiet now!
Fred, look, I know there's something I could do for the lodge show, I know there is.
Can I be in it, can I?
Okay, Lucy, I'll take you.
Oh, Fred, thank you!
Mmm Thank you!
Now, that's the kind of appreciation I like.
Ha, ha, ha!
Can I be in the show, too?
Yep.
Oh, Fred, thank yo What kind of show did you have in mind?
Well, I don't know.
It's for my lodge brothers.
I know just exactly the kind of show that your lodge brothers would like to see.
So do I, but you can't do that kind of a show.
What's the matter with an operetta?
Oh, an operetta!
And I could sing.
The one we did at the women's club.
The one we did at the club.
"Lily of the Valley.
" La da dee la Of the valley Wouldn't that be fun?
Yeah, wouldn't it be fun?
La da dee la Are you kidding?
They'll throw you out of that place if they do a show like that.
Lucy I got it.
I got my act for Fred's lodge show.
It's just the gypsy in my soul.
Well, just forget it.
Fred's got What?
another idea.
He just called.
He'll be here any minute.
What are we gonna do now?
He didn't say.
He's out having lunch with some old crony of his again.
Another old crony?
Where does he dig 'em up?
I don't know.
I think somebody put Fred on the old crony mailing list.
Hi, kids.
Oh, hi.
Hi, Fred.
Well, our troubles are over.
Oh.
Meet, uh, Rattlesnake Jones.
Rattlesnake, my wife Ethel and Lucy Ricardo.
How do you do?
How do you do?
You know, Fred, you always did have a good eye for a young heifer.
Glad to know you, Mrs. Mertz.
I'm Mrs. Mertz.
Oh, excuse me.
Well, the heifer part still goes.
Now, Fred.
Honey, I'm just kidding.
Yeah, he's quite a kidder.
Yeah.
Sit down, everybody.
Sit down.
You say you got a new idea for the show, huh, Fred?
Yeah.
Well, uh, Rattlesnake is in town to see the rodeo at Madison Square Garden.
Uh-huh.
His kid brother's in the show.
Is that so?
Oh, that's nice.
He's going to help us put together a Western show for my lodge.
A Western show!
A Western show!
Yeah.
Well, that's great, ain't it, partner?
You said it, Red.
Yeah, boy.
Well, we gotta get going.
We ain't got much time here.
Let me see what kind of talent we got around here.
Say, Fred, uh, can you and your missus, can y'all do a Western number?
Oh, I'll say we can.
We did "Birmingham Jail" once.
Yeah.
"Birmingham Jail"?
You want to hear it?
Let me hear it.
Come on, Fred.
Yeah.
Ta ta tum Ba ba ba ba bum Send me a letter Oh, send it by mail Send it in care of The Birmingham Jail  Oh, send me Wait, wait.
What's the matter?
That's a Western song, and y'all are doing it Eastern.
What do you mean?
What's the difference?
Western music, you gotta take your time.
Now, you was rushing through that song like your britches was on fire.
Well, we can sing it slower.
Yeah, we'll slow it up.
Yeah, you gotta slow it up a little bit.
You know what you gotta do?
You gotta take your time on it and you really gotta make it sound sad.
Sounded pretty sad to me.
And I'll tell you what to do.
Give it to me again this time.
And when I bend Just bend them notes a little bit.
"Bend them notes," what do you mean?
Bend 'em, just bend When I move my hand down like that, bend them.
Oh, that way.
That's right.
Oh, we can do that.
Yeah, we can try.
Now, make it sad.
Real sad, huh?
Yes, ma'am.
Bum bum bum bum bum bum Send me a let-ter Send it by ma-il Send it in care of The Birmingham jail-il-il-il Oh, we can do that.
That's it, that's it.
Now, that's it.
Okay.
We'll do that.
All right.
Can't go wrong on that there.
Now, little lady What you aiming to do?
I'm aiming to do anything you aim at me.
Well, what we need, we need a pretty girl that can sing a song and yodel.
Well, then you can just stop looking.
Oh, Lucy, you can't yodel.
Well, if you're gonna be technical, she can't sing either.
You just pay them no never mind, Rattle.
They don't know everything about me.
All right, then give me a little touch of yodeling and singing, then.
All right, um Ah, ah, oh, oh, oh Oh oh : Give me a home Where the buffalo roam And the deer and the antelope play Yodel, yodel, yodel And seldom is heard A discouraging word  And the skies What's the matter?
You're about to hear your first discouraging word.
Well, now, I know my yodeling's a little rusty but how about my singing?
You're about to hear your second discouraging word.
Oh Wait a minute.
Now, there must be something we can do with that voice.
Well, I can make a few suggestions.
Now, Fred!
Now, listen, little lady, all you got to remember that us Western folks, we always sing through our noses right here.
Oh, you do?
Yep.
It keeps the prairie dust out our lungs.
Oh, is that right?
Now, this time, give it to me and really whine it out.
Okay.
I will.
Whine it.
Mm.
Yeah.
Oh  Oh, give me a home Where the buffalo roam And the deer and the antelope play Yodel, yodel, yodel How's that?
Can you spin a rope?
No.
Well, can you play a fiddle or-or-or a steel guitar?
No.
I don't know, little lady.
You just don't seem to be the Western-type entertainer.
Oh, I'm not the Eastern-type entertainer either.
I'm just an all-American flop.
Aw, now, honey.
You gotta to think up something for her to do, 'cause Fred promised her she could be in the show.
Yes, I did.
Well, I got it.
Say, I know an act you can do.
What is it?
I'll do anything.
All you got to know is your right hand from your left.
My right hand from my left.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I know.
I know.
Ah.
This is my left hand!
Good girl!
The idea of this act- to make tune on bells.
Like a Swiss bell ringer.
No, like a Western bell ringer.
Oh.
Now, you take these bells Yeah.
and you tie 'em all over you.
All over you?
Yeah, and then you start jingling a little tune.
Uh-huh.
Yeeng Yeeng, yeeng, re-reeng We-re-weeng Oh, she can do that.
I'll be able to do that.
All you gotta do is to play the right note with the bell.
Yeah, I'll be able to do that.
mill stream Where I first met you Down by the Old mill Stream Where I first Met You Down by the old Hi, honey.
Oh, hi, dear.
Hi, sweetie.
Dinner ready?
Not yet, but soon.
Okay.
Lucy Yeah?
What are you doing?
Rehearsing.
Oh.
Rehearsing?
!
Yeah, for the act I'm going to do at Fred's lodge.
Oh.
Lucy, you can't do that kind of an act.
Ricky, I'm gonna have bells tied all over me and I'm going to jiggle a tune.
You know, I've been married to you so long that that sounds logical.
It's gonna be the hit of the show, now, you see.
Hmm, hmm, ho, ho, ho Would you mind stop rehearsing long enough to jiggle me some dinner?
Okay.
You'd better make it scrambled eggs.
Hey, your agent called.
I forgot to tell you.
He wants you to call him.
Johnny?
Yeah.
Johnny Clark speaking.
Hello, Johnny, this is Ricky.
You called me?
Yeah.
I just wanted to check on what numbers you're gonna do Friday night on the Western show?
Western show?
What Western show?
Well, don't you remember?
I asked you to get together a program for the rodeo.
Yeah?
Well?
What's that got to do with a Western show?
!
Oh, no!
Don't you know what a rodeo is?
Of course I know what it is.
It's a little box, and it has a dial and out of it comes music and football games and all that stuff.
Not radio, rodeo.
Rodeo is a big Western show with horses and cowboys.
Oh, are you crazy or something?
I can't do that.
I got a rumba band.
You want to be sued for breach of contract?
Well, I don't Breach of contract?
Fine.
I knew you wouldn't disappoint your public.
I'll tell them everything's all set.
Good-bye.
Mira, que tiene cosa de decirle a esta gente mira  What's the matter, honey?
What's the matter?
I'll tell you what's the matter.
I'm going back to Cuba where the language makes some sense.
You Americans sure have a funny way of talking.
We have a funny way of talking?
Yeah.
You know that radio show I was supposed to do?
Yeah?
It turned out to be a rodeo.
Oh, no!
Oh, yeah.
Now I got to put a whole Western show in two days.
Well, what do you know?
A Western show.
Yeah.
I'd never been in such a mess in my life.
You never had it so good.
What are you talking about?
If I was a Western snake, I'd bite you.
I got to go back to Cuba.
No, no, listen.
Ricky, Ricky, the show we're gonna do for Fred's lodge is a Western show.
Oh, now, honey, now, come on.
Look, it's a natural.
You need a Western show, we got a Western show.
It's heaven-sent.
Well, send it back.
Now, Ricky, you'd better think twice about this.
Now, honey, I got a lot of work to do.
I got to call some agents and see if they've got some Western acts in town.
Now, don't  Hello, Harry?
Look, this is Ricky.
Look, they've booked me into a Western show, and I want to know if I can get some Western acts from you.
Yes.
What about Tex Ritter?
He's out of town.
What about that, uh, fellow, that Gabby Hayes?
He's very good.
No.
Well, how about that fellow that plays Wyatt Earp?
You know, O'Brien.
Oh.
Well, look, I-I know that the rodeo is booked into the Garden for two weeks, but there must be some Western acts around that are not at the Garden.
You couldn't get anybody at all?
Uh, all right.
Thanks for trying.

You mean you'll take us?
I'm afraid so.
I've already had a wonderful act.
Well, there's one thing that I like real good about your act.
What's that?
It won't cost me any money.
Fellow Western performers who are the only ones available, may I see you for a minute?
About that Western show you need so badly, I am afraid we have other commitments.
Uh, yes.
Fred's lodge show is that night.
Of course, we can postpone the lodge show if the price was right.

{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Lucy, can I borrow an egg?
I'm baking a cake and I'm short one.
What's the matter?
Are you sick or something?
No.
I spent the day with Little Ricky in the park.
I am suffering from a disease common to mothers of three-year-old children.
It is called "poop-itis.
" Oh-ho-ho-ho.
He really gives you a workout, doesn't he?
He never stops running.
Well, is there anything I can do for you?
Yeah, help me put my feet up on the couch.
Okay, honey.
Oh, you poor little thing.
Oh, gosh.
Want me to take off your boots?
No, thanks.
I'll take them off later.
Help yourself to the eggs.
Okay.
I hope you feel better after you've rested a while.
Hi, hon.
Oh, hi.
What are you doing lying there with your coat and your boots on?
Motherhood.
Lucy!
Relax, dear.
I meant motherhood of a three-year-old child.
: Oh.
Did Ricky give you a tough day?
No, just the same as any other day.
After breakfast, I put on his snow suit.
I pull on his galoshes.
I slip on his mittens.
I walk him to the park.
He chases the pigeons.
I chase after him.
He runs after the squirrels.
I run after him.
He gets on the swing.
I push the swing.
We go on the teeter-totter.
He teeters, I totter.
Then we leave the park and we walk home.
I pull off his galoshes and I pull off his mittens.
I pull off his snow suit.
I fix his lunch.
I put him down for his nap and he sleeps for a whole half-hour.
Well, that sounds very After his nap, I put on his snow suit, pull on his galoshes and I pull on his mittens, we walk back to the park.
He chases after the pigeons.
I chase after him.
He runs after the squirrels.
I run after him.
He gets on the swing.
I push the swing.
We get on the teeter-totter.
He teeters.
By now, I'm really tottering.
We leave the park.
We walk home.
I pull off his galoshes.
I pull off his mittens.
I pull off his snow suit.
I tell him to go in his room and play with his teddy bear.
And that is why you find me sitting here with my coat and my boots on.
Phew!
Wow!
What's the matter with you?
I'm worn out from just listening.
Honestly, I'm so tired, I could scream.
Well, go ahead and scream.
It'll do you good.
I'm too tired.
Honey, it's just silly for you to get this tired every day.
Little Ricky is three years old now.
There's only one thing to do.
Now, don't start that again.
What again?
You want me to send him to nursery school.
That's right.
Well, I won't hear of it.
He's entirely too young.
You said that six months ago.
And I was right.
We're just gonna have to wait until he gets older.
How much older?
Well, until I feel he's old enough to go to nursery school.
Well, he's gonna look pretty silly playing in a sand pile when he's 30 years old.
Now, honey, don't be funny.
Now, look, it's not, it's not fair to the kid.
He needs children his own age to play with.
He has plenty of playmates.
Who?
Me, Ethel, Fred.
Well, Fred and you and Ethel are not exactly Little Ricky's age.
Although at times you act like you were.
It may interest you to know that one of the world's leading authorities on baby care does not think he should go to nursery school.
Who's that?
Dr. Spock.
I've been reading his book ever since Little Ricky was born.
Now, this is what he has to say on the subject.
I quote, "A good nursery school does not take the place of home.
" So, there.
Well, that doesn't sound right to me.
Let me see that book.
I told you what it said.
What's good enough for Dr. Spock is good enough for me.
Let me see the book.
Give it to me.
Why'd you want to see the book?
I told you what it says.
I want to see the Uh-huh.
You didn't quite finish that sentence.
"A good nursery school doesn't take the place of the home.
"It adds to it.
"Most children benefit from a good nursery school.
"It is particularly valuable for the only child, "for the child without much chance to play with others and for the child who lives in a small apartment.
" That's what the good doctor says.
Well, what does he know?
This man is supposed to be one of the authorities on baby care.
He says that Little Ricky should go to nursery school.
I don't care.
Well, I do.
I say that he should go to nursery school and so does Dr. Spook.
Dr. Spock, and he doesn't know everything.
Well was he ever a mother?
Now, Lucy He can't go.
He'll catch germs there.
Germs?
Yes.
All those other children have germs.
And I suppose that we have the only sanitary child in New York City.
You know perfectly well that as soon as a child starts to go to school, they come home with chicken pox and measles and all sorts of nasty little diseases.
Well, that's part of being a child.
What are you gonna do?
Seal him up in a plastic bag until he's 21 years old?
Oh Now, look, Lucy, this does it.
I want you to promise me that tomorrow morning you are going to enroll Little Ricky in nursery school.
No buts.
But Ricky No, no buts!
All right.
You'll be a better mother, too.
You won't get so tired.
What's the matter?
What are you crying about?
We're losing our baby.
Now, honey, it's only nursery school.
Today, nursery school.
Tomorrow, college.
And then he'll get married and have children of his own.
We'll never see him again.
: Oh now, Mama.
Come on.
: I'm losing my baby.
Lucy?
Yeah?
Have you seen Ethel?
Not since this morning.
She took Little Ricky to the park while I went to nursery school.
You went to nursery school?
Yeah.
I thought you promised Ricky you'd take the baby to nursery school.
I promised him I would enroll the baby in nursery school and I did enroll him.
I didn't promise he would attend.
Oh, brother.
What's he gonna say when he hears that?
Nothing, if we all keep our big blabbery lips buttoned up.
Now, don't worry.
I'm not the one to break that kind of news to him.
Well.
Hi.
Hi, Rick.
Got to check the furnace.
Bye, Rick.
He sure is in a hurry.
Yeah.
Say, uh, how did Little Ricky like nursery school?
Uh You took him, didn't you?
I enrolled him just like I promised you.
Well, how did he like it?
He didn't say.
He's a close-mouthed little rascal.
What are you talking about, honey?
What did they do there?
Oh, you know the kind of things they do in nursery school.
No, I don't.
You went to nursery school in Cuba, didn't you?
Yeah.
Well, they do the same things over here, only in English.
Lucy, what's the big, uh, secret?
I mean, what, what, what's, uh What-what do they have over there?
Well, it's sort of hard to describe.
What do you mean, hard to describe?
Do they, uh Th-They must have sand piles and swings and slides.
Good.
That's just what they have.
Well, how about finger-painting and, uh building blocks?
All right.
What else do they have?
Oh, you name it and they got it.
I got to finish my cake.
Remarkable school.
Lucy?
Yeah?
Say, listen, Lucy, I've been thinking this over.
And I'll bet you when Ricky finds out that you didn't take the baby to nursery Aha!
Thank you, Ethel bean-spiller.
Lucy, come here.
Hi, Ricky.
Lucy!
Gee, I didn't know you were home.
I didn't hear you come up the stairs.
Oh, you!
Well, it's all your fault.
You're the one that pestered Fred to have the stairs carpeted.
Oh Come here.
Why did you tell me that you took Ricky to nursery school?
I didn't.
You did, too.
I did not!
I said I enrolled him and I did enroll him.
I just didn't take him there.
Lucy, I'm ashamed of you.
Well, I tried, but he refused.
He refused?
Yes, yes.
Ethel was right here when I asked him.
Didn't I ask him?
Yup, she asked him.
She said, "Little Ricky, "you don't want to go to that nasty old school, do you"?
Whose side are you on?
Oh, what's the difference.
I'm glad the cat's out of the bag.
I'm his godmother and I think he should go to nursery school.
If you ask me Yeah, well, nobody's asking you.
Just butt out!
Never mind.
You keep butting in.
I never know anything around here if you didn't come up once in a while and spin the beans out of the cat bag.
It's not "spin the beans out of the cat bag.
" It's, it's "spill the beans" or "let the cat out of the bag.
" It doesn't matter which way it goes.
The only thing that is important is that tomorrow morning Little Ricky is gonna go to nursery school because I am going to take him.
This is delicious.
Little Ricky, come on.
Let's go to nursery school.
Little Ricky?
Come on, amigo!
Let's go to nursery school.
You seen Little Ricky?
No.
What do you mean, "no"?
Where can he be?
Maybe he didn't want to go to nursery school, so he ran away from home.
Lucy, you've hidden him!
Why, whatever makes you say a thing like that?
Ay, mira que tiene esta mujer, las cosas Little Ricky, where are you?
Little Ricky!
Little Ricky?
!
Lucy, where is he?
I'll never tell.
Little Ricky, come out wherever you're hiding!
Come on out!
Why don't you try calling "Olly, olly, oxen free"!
What does that mean?
Oh, I forget you're unfamiliar with our American expressions.
You see, in this country, children have a game called hide-and-seek.
And when the player who is "it" wants all of his little playmates to come out from wherever they're hiding, he yells, "Olly, olly, oxen free"!
And all the little children come scampering out, and the game is over.
And do you also have an expression for whenever a husband is tired of playing hide-and-seek, and he's just about read to hit the wife in the nose?
Uh, not up to now, we don't.
Look, I have a right to know where he is.
He's half my child, you know?
Well, he's half mine, too, and, unfortunately, when I hid my half, your half went right along with it.
Well, unfortunately, your half has to go to nursery school with my half.
Not until you find him.
Lucy, where is he?
There he is!
Fred!
I thought I told you to stay out until at least 11:00.
Come on, son.
How are you, partner?
Oh, Fred!
Oh, sweetie pie!
I'll talk to you later.
You're going to nursery school.
Oh, please.
You be a good boy now.
Mind the teacher, and don't go near any of these other children that have germs!
Oh Fred Mertz!
Aah, don't start on me, Lucy.
I'm too weak to defend myself.
Men are not cut out to be mothers.
Oh He just loved school.
He didn't even want to come home.
No kidding.
That's wonderful.
Yeah, and look, look, his first painting.
Oh, isn't that great?
Isn't it wonderful?
Yeah.
You know what it is, don't you?
Sure.
Yeah.
What?
Oh, uh It's a sailboat.
Oh, Ethel, it's a house.
It is?
Sure.
Well, now, wait a minute.
You're both wrong.
It's an elephant.
You know, he's smarter than I thought.
This is a picture of an elephant sailing a houseboat.
That's right.
Yeah.
Of course it is.
That's right.
Isn't it wonderful.
I'm going to have it framed and hang it in my bedroom.
You can  Hi.
Honey, honey, Look!
Look!
Hi, Rick.
The first thing your son ever did in school.
Well, how about that?
!
Isn't that great?
Yes, it is.
Isn't it wonderful?
Boy!
I bet, I bet he's gonna be another Grandpa Moses.
You know what it is, don't you?
Why, sure.
It's a It's an, it's an elephant sailing a houseboat.
Of course.
Sure.
What else could it be?
That's right.
Isn't that wonderful?
Isn't that wonderful the talent that child has shown in one day?
Well, it's hereditary, you know.
Oh, hereditary!
It's the nursery school.
It's working out fine just like I told you it would.
Like you?
: Mira que esta muchacha Hey, hey, hey, hey, now, watch your language.
The baby will be learning Spanish any day now.
Oh, I think I hear the baby.
The baby learning Spanish!
He's too young.
Well, I don't know.
I was speaking Spanish when I was his age.
Oh, well Well, I hope you are satisfied.
Well, what's the matter?
The baby is sneezing.
Sneezing?
I told you that nursery school is nothing but a hotbed of bacteria.
Dr. Gettleman?
This is Lucy Ricardo.
Something's wrong with our baby.
Can you come over right away?
There's nothing to worry about, Mrs. Ricardo.
It's just a mild tonsillitis.
Are you sure?
Oh, yes.
I'll write you a prescription.
You and that nursery school!
You can't blame it on the nursery school, Mrs. Ricardo.
After all, this is the fourth attack of tonsillitis Little Ricky's had this year.
It's all your fault.
My fault?
He just told you it had nothing to do with nursery school.
He inherited his weak tonsils from you.
What are you talking about?
Everybody knows Cubans have weak tonsils.
Doctor, do Cubans have weak tonsils?
Not that I ever heard of.
Thank you.
Well, he certainly didn't get them from me.
I had the strongest tonsils on the block.
They'd bulge with muscles.
People used to come from miles around saying, "Let me look at your tonsils.
" Oh Well I'm afraid you'll have a siege like this to look forward to every time he has a cold, Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, dear!
As I strongly I advise that when this infection clears up, we remove those tonsils.
Oh, no, Doctor!
Well, honey, we don't have to decide right now.
He's just a little baby!
We can talk about it later.
I know, sweetheart.
Thank you for coming, Doctor.
I'll drop this at the drugstore and have them send it up.
That infection will clear up in a few days.
Well Good night.
Good night.
Good night, Doctor.
Oh LITTLE  Mama!
Oh, I'm coming, dear.
LITTLE  Mama, my teddy bear.
Oh, he wants his teddy bear.
The patient is being flown in.
Tell all those medical students interested to be ready to come over as soon as we call.
This is a most unusual operation.
Good-bye.
Come on, honey.
Let's go.
Oh, I hate to leave the baby like this.
Honey, the operation was over hours ago.
The baby's in fine shape.
He's getting the best of care.
You haven't eaten all day.
Come on, you gotta eat something.
Oh, all right.
Nurse?
Yes?
Please take good care of our little boy until we get back.
Ricky Ricardo Jr., Room 602.
We will.
Okay.
I'll be right back as soon as I have dinner and then you won't have to bother, 'cause I'm gonna spend the night with him.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Ricardo.
Parents are not allowed to stay overnight with their children.
Oh, but this is the first time our baby's ever been in a hospital and I promised him.
Oh, my dear, I'm sorry- regulations.
Re-re Well, well, we'll just have to get permission.
We'll have to call Dr. Gettleman.
I'm afraid that won't do you any good.
But I I promised him.
But, honey Well, she says it's regulations.
But, honey, I promised him.
I promised him.
I I've never broken a promise to him in my life.
I know, honey.
Well, you shouldn't have promised And I-I promised that I'd bring him his teddy bear so he could to cuddle with it.
I know, honey, but there's nothing you can do about it.
It's against regulations.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Now, come on, let me get some dinner for you and have a good night's sleep, huh?
Come on.
Good night.
See you in the morning.
Yeah.
See you in the morning.
Yes?
Good evening.
Can I help you?
No, thank you.
Are you a patient?
Oh, of course.
The maternity ward is just in there, to the right.
Would you register first, please?
: in the morning.
Thank you.
Wait a minute!
Say, did you just send up a maternity case?
You didn't?
!
Thanks.
Madam?
Madam!
Madam!
Where did she go?
Madam?
Did a red-haired woman just go through here?
I didn't see anyone.
Why?
Well, she just ran right by my desk.
Patient?
Maternity.
When?
Any minute.
I mean, when did she run past you?
Just now.
Look, if you see her let me know, will you?
Okay.
All right, nurse, we're ready for the next patient.
Uh, just a minute.
Let go.
What's the matter?
M- M-My patient changed his mind.
He doesn't want an operation.
Do you?
No, no, no.
He's decided to hang on to whatever it was you were gonna take out.
Oh, cut the nonsense.
Now, wait a minute.
Dr. Barnett's waiting to perform this operation.
Believe me, this man does not want to be cut open!
He does not want to be cut open!
This man does not want to be cut open!
Gentlemen, I want to apologize for calling you in here at this hour of the night, but this is a most unusual operation.
You may never have a chance of seeing anything like this again.
Thought you should see it.
I understand a few of you have never witnessed surgery before, and under those circumstances, we always have a few incidents of fainting.
Now, if you feel as though you're going to keel over, why, just step back, so you don't fall over the patient.
Listen, you don't understand.
This is a mistake.
A big mistake.
Nurse, what's going on here?
M- My patient has changed his mind.
He doesn't want to have the operation.
He doesn't want to have the operation?
No, he doesn't want any part of this whole ordeal.
Well, why, you've got the sheet pulled over his head.
He can't stand the sight of blood.
Why, why, this is most unusual.
Oh, he says he wants to go home.
I'm gonna have to take him home.
He lives quite a ways from here- New Rochelle.
I have to take him all the way out there.
This is unusual.
Well, what patient is that?
This is your patient for the operation, Doctor.
Well, what patient is this?
Get ahold of yourself.
Doctor!
Nurse?
Yes?
Look, I'm looking for my wife, Mrs. Ricardo, and I think she's in Room 602 with our child.
No, she couldn't be.
It isn't permitted.
Well, I got a feeling that that's where she is.
You evidently don't know our rules.
Well, you evidently don't know my wife.
No one missing from the psychiatric ward, Nurse.
Thank you, dear.
I'll keep looking.
Look, if you would just take me to Room Oh, I'm awfully sorry, but I just don't have the time.
The whole hospital's in a turmoil, trying to find some screwball, redheaded nurse that has gone berserk.
Was she carrying a teddy bear?
How did you know?
Well, let me put it this way.
I am looking for my screwball, redheaded wife who has been berserk for 15 years.
Now, if you'll just take me to this Room 602, I got a hunch that we're gonna solve both our problems.
Well, very well, but I'm quite sure it won't do a bit of good.
Well, you never can tell.
It's entirely against the rules.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Fred?
Hey, Fred.
I'll have this lamp fixed in a minute, honeybunch.
Don't Oh, it's you.
Listen, I'm sorry I startled you, Fred, but, uh, I got a serious problem, and I need your advice.
Well, what's the trouble?
Well, my agent has booked me and my band on a tour of Europe.
Going to Europe?
Hey, that's terrific.
Now, what's the problem?
I won't be able to take Lucy along.
You know, that is a problem.
Well, you see, it's only a three-week trip, and we'll be doing mostly one-nighters, so I won't have any time for sightseeing or stuff like that.
And being such a short trip, I can't afford to take her with me.
Well, that makes sense.
To you and me, yes, but what about Lucy?
What am I going to do?
Well, you could go out some night to buy a pack of cigarettes and not come back for three weeks.
Oh, Fred.
Hey, I know how to fix it.
How?
Don't go.
I gotta go.
It's good for my career.
Besides, I already signed the contract.
Yeah, well.
Listen, suppose I tell her the truth.
You think that maybe she'll be reasonable this time?
I know where you can get eight to five.
I guess I lost my head.
Well, suppose I promise her something else.
Suppose I say that later on I will take her on a wonderful trip to Europe, just the two of us.
That will never work.
Oh, now, wait just a minute.
Let's see how it sounds.
You be Lucy.
I'll be Lu Just pretend you're Lucy and I come home and I say: Hi, honey.
I'm home.
Lucy, my agent tells me that he has booked me on a tour of Europe.
: Europe?
!
Oh, honey, that's wonderful!
I don't believe it.
I'm so thrilled for you.
: Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
Caroline, guess what.
I'm going to Europe.
Good-bye.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, now, Fred, she won't act like that.
Are we talking about the same Lucy?
Now, if I promise her a wonderful trip later on, I think she'll be reasonable.
My Lucy has red hair and blue eyes.
What does your Lucy look like?
Well, there's one good thing about this idea.
What?
It's the only one I've got.
Come on, let's see how it works.
: All right, I'm with you.
Honey, I'm home!
Okay, dear.
Hello.
Hi, Fred.
Hi, Lucy.
Honey, I've got something to tell you.
What?
My agent has booked me and my band on a tour of Europe.
Europe?
!
Oh, honey!
That's wonderful!
Oh, honey!
Oh, Fred, isn't that exciting?
Oh, Europe!
Honey, you don't know how much I'm looking forward to this.
For years and years and years!
Caroline, this is Lucy.
Guess what.
We're going to Europe.
Yes.
Good-bye.
Just call me Dunninger.
What do I do now?
Well, you're married to her.
I just read her mind.
Hello, Josephine?
Uh, good-bye, Josephine.
Look, sweetie, we got a lot of things to discuss.
Oh, I know.
My, my overseas shots, my tickets, my, uh, my new clothes I can't take you along.
You can't take me along.
Uh, I gotta have my luggage and camera.
What do you mean you can't take me along?
Honey, look, sit down a minute, will you?
I want to explain this to you.
Look, it's a very short trip.
It's only about three weeks.
I'll be doing mostly one-nighters.
I won't have any time for sightseeing or stuff like that.
And being such a short trip, I can't afford to take you along.
You understand, don't you?
Yeah, I understand.
Good.
But why can't I go?
Now, honey, listen, I'll take you on a wonderful trip to Europe later on.
Just the two of us.
No!
I want to go this time.
Well, I can't afford it this time.
Oh, Ricky, you never take me anyplace.
What do you mean I never take you anyplace?
We just came back from a wonderful trip to Hollywood just a month ago.
Yeah, but where have you taken me lately?
Now, look, sweetheart, you be a good girl, be a good girl, and I promise you that next year I'll take you on a wonderful trip to Europe, just the two of us.
Oh, sure.
I will.
I promise you.
Well, okay, if you promise.
Ah, that's my baby.
What a wonderful wife I've got.
I knew you'd understand.
Listen, I tell you what.
Tonight just go out for dinner.
Just the two of us.
Okay.
All right?
Okay, honey.
That's my baby.
Lucy, Lucy I was just down in the market and the butcher told me you were gonna go to Europe.
The butcher?
How did he know?
The grocery boy told him.
How did he get it?
Well, he just made a delivery to Marion Strong.
Well, how in the world did Ma?
Oh, Marion Strong.
She's just a hop, skip and a blab from Caroline Appleby.
What's the difference how they found out?
Aren't you excited?
When do you leave?
I don't.
I'm not going.
What do you mean?
Well, Ricky's only gonna be there for three weeks.
Well, you could see a lot of Europe in three weeks.
Yeah, I know, but he's gonna be so busy, and I'd be all alone.
All alone in those fancy Paris shops- just you and Ricky's checkbook.
Yeah, I know, but he doesn't think I ought to go with him.
What husband would?
Oh, Ethel, he'd love to take me if he could.
Oh, sure.
He would, he said so, and he also said he couldn't take me this time, he'd take me on a trip next year all over Europe, just the two of us.
And wipe that cynical look off your face.
Huh.
He gave me his promise.
He'd never broken his promise to me.
Uh-huh.
Oh, you just don't know Ricky, that's all.
He's a man, isn't he?
Well, yes.
Oh, boy, what a setup for him.
Three glorious weeks in Europe.
Just the band.
No wives along.
Yeah.
And then a whole week on glamorous shipboard and then London.
And then Rome.
And then Paris.
Yeah.
And he says he can't afford to take you along.
Three weeks isn't long enough.
He'll be too busy.
Oh, brother.
Did he ever pull a wool over your eyes.
Yeah.
Oh, hi.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi.
Where, where do you want to go to eat, sweetie?
Don't you "sweetie" me!
What's the matter?
I know what you're up to, you-you-you Cuban wool-puller!
What happened?
Lucy, come here.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Barney.
Look, I was trying to get you all day yesterday.
Yeah.
Say, Barney, how would you like your old job back?
Oh, you're working for Cougie now, huh?
Well, uh look, Barney, my agent has booked me on a tour of Europe and I need a good manager.
Yeah, band manager.
Well, look, I can't think of anybody.
If you happen to think of someone that you think would be good, would you have him call me?
Thanks a lot, Barney.
Good-bye.
Ricky?
Yeah?
I'm speaking to you again.
You are?
Yeah, I know a wonderful manager for your band.
Me.
Who?
Honey, it wouldn't cost you a cent and I get to go along.
Now, look, Lucy, I'd love to be able to do it, but a bandman has a lot of responsibilities.
He has to keep the luggage straight, he has to see that all the boys get on the right train, he has to make all the hotel reservations Yeah, well, give me a chance.
I'll bet I can get your boys all over Europe.
We we play a lot better when we're all in one place.
Aw, now Now, honey, forget it, it won't work.
Well, if I raise the money myself, can I go?
Look, if you can raise enough money to go to Europe, let me know, and I'll quit the band business.
You didn't answer my question.
If I raise enough money myself, and it doesn't cost you a cent, can I go?
That's impossible.
Well, if I can and it doesn't, can I?
Sure.
Why not?
Good!
I'm going to Europe.
Oh, boy!
I'll call mother and ask her if she could stay with the baby for three weeks.
Oh, honey!
Honey, you're the most wonderful husband in the whole world.
Mmm huh!
I love you, huh!
Uh-oh, wrong apartment.
Oh, Ethel, I don't need you now.
Ricky said that I could go to Europe with him.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Well, there are some conditions.
Never mind now.
I'm going.
Oh, that's wonderful, Rick.
I'm sorry about this.
She made me do this, Rick.
: I'm sorry.
I'm gonna get to go to Europe!
Oh, Lucy, I'm gonna get to my goodness!
to go to Europe!
That's wonderful.
Fred let me I want to ask you something.
Yeah?
Listen, who used to handle your act when you were in vaudeville, you know?
Nobody.
I did it myself.
You did?
I took care of the bookings transportation, hotels and everything.
No kidding.
Yeah.
Hmm maybe No, it won't work.
What?
Oh, it was just a wild thought.
You wouldn't want to leave Ethel.
Try me.
How would you like to manage the band in this European tour?
Would I?
Brother, you've got a manager.
Well, wonderful, Fred.
Oh, Fred is going to Europe!
Oh, Fred, that's wonderful!
You and Ricky and me and Oh, dear.
Don't mind me.
I'll just stay here alone while you're all having a wonderful trip to Europe.
I don't want to see Europe anyway.
It's so old.
You just send me a postcard now and then from wherever you're at.
Oh, Fred, you have to take Ethel with you.
What do you mean I have to take Ethel with me?
Well, think of it: Ethel all alone here in New York and you all alone in Paris.
Yeah.
You're a big help.
Oh, no, honey, Oh	 I didn't mean that.
You know I didn't.
Now, just a minute.
Everybody is getting upset about nothing.
Now, Lucy, you tell them how I said you could go.
Oh, oh, oh, he said I could go if I if I raise the money for my trip myself.
Well, that's Oh, great.
more like it.
Well, Fred, if Ethel raises the money for her trip, can she go?
Sure; I'm a sport.
Why not?
There, you see!
Oh, Lucy, we couldn't raise the money for a trip to Europe.
Ethel, you are not holding a positive thought.
Now say, "We will be able to raise the money.
" Say it.
"We will be able to raise the money.
" "We will be able to raise the money.
" Yes, ma'am!
Now, how much will it need?
How much it will be?
Well, let's see now.
Boat fare, travel expenses, hotel, meal for the two of you- I'd say about $3,000.
You see, all we got to do is scrape up $3,000?
!
Money found in overstuffed chairs and sofa cushions: $9.73.
Money for sugar bowls: $29.25.
Piggy banks: $28.16.
G.T.H.P.
: $15.36.
What's G.T.H.P.
?
Going through husband's pants.
Oh, yeah.
Didn't you go through Fred's pants?
Every pair, including his World War I cavalry britches.
What did you get?
A handful of lint and a Woodrow Wilson button.
Now, what does it all come to?
Well, let's see.
$200.16.
Not bad, huh?
Oh, great.
Where will we get the other $2,800?
How much do you get for selling blood?
Oh, Lucy.
What's wrong with that?
You couldn't get $2,800 worth of blood out of a herd of elephants.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Let's see, how can we take our $200 and make it into $3,000?
Yeah.
How about the Irish Sweepstakes?
Nah, the odds are too great.
Yeah.
What we need is a good local raffle where they're giving away two free trips to Europe and we got all the tickets.
Ha, ha!
Yeah.
Hey!
Why not hold our own raffle?
What?
The money we take in will pay for our trip.
Now, what can we raffle off?
Your brain, for thinking up an idea like that.
No, no, no.
Now, this is good.
People are always raffling off things like automobiles, mink coats, television sets.
That's it.
We could take our $200, buy a television set and raffle it off.
Well, I guess it would work at that.
Sure it would.
Only Only what?
Well, raffles are always held for needy causes.
Ethel, at this moment, you and I are the two neediest causes I can think of.
Is it honest?
It's a hundred percent honest.
Look, we say we're gonna have a raffle.
We sell tickets.
Somebody who buys a ticket wins a television set.
What could be more honest than that?
I guess it is.
Sure it is.
Now, all we have to do for our needy cause is think up a good phony name.
Let's see.
I don't suppose we could call it two bundles for Britain?
No.
It has to sound real.
How about Ladies Overseas Aid?
Well Look, we're ladies, we want to go overseas and, boy, do we need aid.
Okay, Ladies Overseas Aid it is.
Yes, ma'am.
Who you gonna call?
Mr. Feldman, the man who sold us our television set.
I thought maybe he could give us a good price on one.
Hello?
Mr. Feldman?
Yes.
This is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, remember?
Oh, yes.
Is there something wrong with your television set?
Oh, no, no, it's fine.
As a matter of fact, I want to buy another one.
Oh?
Yes.
We're, uh, trying to raise money for a needy cause, the Ladies Overseas Aid, and we want to raffle off a television set.
I see.
I thought maybe you could give us a good price on one.
The Ladies Overseas Aid?
Yes.
It's a new group but very worthy.
What aid do you give?
Uh, well just to, uh, pick a case at random from our files, at the moment, we're trying to raise money to send two dear little ladies to Europe to be with their families.
Aw, that's nice.
Yes.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll donate a set.
You'll dona oh!
He'll donate a set.
Oh, Mr. Feldman, that's just wonderful of you.
I have an idea.
I'll have your tickets printed for you with my advertising on the back and then we can have the drawing in the store here.
Is that all right with you?
Well, that is just perfect.
We'll be down later to discuss the details with you, Mr. Feldman.
And thank you very much.
Good-bye.
Europe, here we come!
How about that!
Oh, boy.
I never knew 3,000 tickets weighed so much.
Whoo!
Honey, is that you?
My gosh, Ricky's home.
Quick, get ahold of those.
Put them in there.
Yeah, dear?
!
Okay.
Yeah, honey?
!
Hi.
Hi, Rick.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi.
I didn't know you were home, dear.
Well, I got home early, so I was playing with Little Ricky.
Oh.
Mrs. Trumbull went to the market.
Oh, oh, I see.
Well, I'm glad you had some time to play with the baby.
Well, I got to run along and start selling my raffle tickets.
Oh, yeah, me, too.
I'll see you later.
So long.
Okay, dear.
Bye.
What's this about raffle tickets?
Oh, well, well, our club is raffling off a TV set to raise money for that well-known and very worthy organization, Ladies Overseas Aid.
Oh, all right.
How much?
Oh, well, the tickets are a dollar apiece.
How many do you want?
Well, honey, we've gone through this before.
Let's save time, huh?
I'll take all the tickets you have.
Oh.
All of them?
Yeah.
Wow!
I think I've only got about ten left.
All right, I'll take them.
Okay.
Boy, I'm getting off easy.
I thought I was going to have to buy at least 20.
look.
Oh, yeah, by George, I've got 20!
Yeah, I've got 20.
Here.
As long as it is for a worthy cause.
Oh, it is.
I don't know when a cause has seemed so worthy to me.
The need of those dear little ladies just gets me- right here.
No, no, Marge, you don't have to be there.
Yeah, I'll let you know if you win, that is, if you let me off the phone.
I'm gonna be late for the drawing.
Oh, someone's at the door.
I gotta go, girl.
Bye.
Yes?
Yes, sir.
Mrs. Ricardo?
My name is Jamison, from the district attorney's office.
The district attorney's?
That's right.
Won't you come in, please?
Thank you very much.
I, uh, understand you're running a raffle today.
Oh, yes, we are.
Would you like to buy a ticket?
No.
I'd just like to ask a few questions about it.
Oh.
Oh, all right.
Well, let's see now.
Um, we're holding the drawing at Feldman's Appliance Store.
The tickets are a dollar apiece.
We're giving away rather a large model	Uh, TV set Mrs. Ricardo, tell me something about this organization, the Ladies Overseas Aid.
: Oh ha, ha!
Well, if you promise not to tell my husband because, uh, we just sort of made the name up.
Ladies Overseas Aid.
It really should be called The Ethel Mertz And Lucy Ricardo Want To Go To Europe Aid.
Ha, ha, ha!
But then nobody would buy a ticket, would they?
Ha, ha!
We-we just made it up.
Mrs. Ricardo, if you've been selling tickets under false pretenses, you've committed a crime.
A crime?
Oh, no, you don't understand.
Anybody that buys a ticket buys a chance to win the television set.
Someone will win the television set, so nobody gets hurt, right?
Mrs. Ricardo, the people who bought those tickets thought they were contributing to a reputable charity.
Therefore, you've defrauded them.
Now, fraud is a crime that's punishable by one to ten years in the penitentiary.
But I'm going to Europe.
I don't have time for ten years in the penitentiary.
No, you just may have to.
Oh, but I didn't know it was a crime.
I wouldn't have done it if I'd known it was a crime.
I understand, Mrs. Ricardo.
Now, look, here's what we can do.
If you're willing to call off the raffle and give the money back, we'll forget the whole thing.
Well, I will.
I will.
Well, I certainly hope so, because once the drawing's actually held, the matter is out of my hands, and we have to prosecute.
Oh, I hope we can make it in time.
The drawing is in 15 minutes.
Lucy, I've come over to ask you Fred!
Fred, I'm so glad you're here.
Will you stay with the baby?
I have to go downtown.
I'll be right back.
You'll stay with Sure I will.
Little Ricky?
Sure.
Okay.
A crime?
!
Are you sure?
I can't imagine why Mrs. Ricardo isn't here, but I'm sure she wouldn't mind if we just went ahead without her.
So, shall we?
Let's do.
Ha, ha, ha!
Now, you hold, Mr. Feldman.
Here we go, oh This is to keep it honest, you know.
All righty, now, shake up those tickets, Mr. Feldman.
Here we go.
All righty.
Oh, oh Here we go.
Let's see who's going to win.
The winning number is Oh  I'm such a dope.
Number 2725.
Oh!
That's me!
I've won.
Mrs. Hazel Beardswell!
Mrs. Beardswell.
Oh, congratulations, dear.
Ethel, Ethel, I have to talk to you.
Oh, you're late.
We just had the drawing.
Here, take the money I won.
No, no, no, no.
Well, honey, I have something else I have to thank everybody for.
Oh, you'll never know how happy this $3,000 is going to make two dear little ladies.
Ethel Just a minute, dear, now.
Mr. Feldman, thank you so much.
Well, thank you, Mrs. Mertz.
But I really didn't do anything.
But I never saw anyone work as hard as Mrs. Mertz and Mrs. Ricardo.
Well, come up here, Mrs. Ricardo.
Come on Oh, no, no.
Come on.
She worked so hard for this money.
Oh, they worked very hard.
They worked so hard, you'd think they were gonna keep the money themselves.
Now, now, ladies, I have a very pleasant surprise for you.
Who do you think is in town?
Who?
Mrs. Wolbert.
Mrs. Wolbert?
Yeah.
She called me this morning and we arranged this wonderful surprise for you.
Now, here she is, all the way from Indiana, Mrs. Dorothea Wolbert, President of the Ladies Overseas Aid!
My dear, you have done stupendous work, and this money is more than we've ever received before at any one time for the Ladies Overseas Aid Uh-huh.
and I'm delighted to be here to accept the money in person.
Ethel Ethel, give her the money.
Give her the money?
Give her the money.
Uh Is she going with us?
Ethel, Ethel, The money here, let her have it.
Here you are, dear.
Now, how about a round of recognition for these two wonderful women, Mrs. Ricardo and Mrs. Mertz?
Forever Forever, forever, darling Forever, darling, while other hearts go wandering You'll find mine as faithful as can be Forever, forever, my darling I'll be your true love forever and forever I'll care for you eternally Eternally I've known your kiss and I've been close to heaven The thrill of this will last me Till my life is through I made this promise And willingly I'll keep it Forever Forever, darling You will find me true Ever and ever Forever, forever, forever Darling, you will find me true.
That sounds like a print, Ricky.
Good.
Want to pick up the phone?
Someone from the steamship company.
Uh, thanks.
Hello.
Yes?
Well, I-I guess we could play on the boat, but What?
!
You will?
!
It won't?
!
Brother, we'll play all the way over.
Yeah, thank you.
Listen, I gotta go home and tell Lucy something.
I'll be back.
See you later.
Good-bye.
Thanks a lot, fellows.
Bye, Leo.
Hi, Fred.
Oh Now look what you did!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where's the baby?
Napping.
He-he got bored.
Oh.
Well, thanks for baby-sitting.
Oh, never mind.
Did the raffle go all right?
Yeah, it went all right, but we don't care.
No, we don't care.
What canary did you two cats swallow?
Shall I tell him?
Go ahead.
We raised the money for our trip to Europe.
And legitimately.
How did you two clowns ever get ahold of $3,000 legitimately?
You think he's ready?
Tell him.
Well, I suddenly remembered that this building was in my name, so I mortgaged it.
Fred!
Fred!
Fred!
Fred!
Fred?
Fred?
Are you all right?
Fred?
Hey, honey, honey, I've got wonderful What's the matter?
What happened to Fred?
Fred fainted.
Ethel told him that she mortgaged the building so we could go to Europe.
Oh, you didn't have to do that.
No?
Why not?
Well, I thought I had to pay the passage for everyone in the band, but I found out about playing aboard ship, I don't have to, so with the money I save, you two can come along.
You can take us for nothing?
!
Oh!
Fred!
Hey, Fred!
He didn't hear you.
Fred, you listen to me.
Fred!
We can all go to Europe and it won't cost you a cent!
Yeah!
Fred, Fred, we won't need this.
No.
You feel all right?
I never felt better in my life.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Hi, Lucy.
What are you doing?
Hi.
Ethel, I have a schedule of all the places the band's gonna play in Europe.
Really?
Our whole itinerary.
Yeah?
Listen to this: London,  Paris, Venice, Holland the Riviera, Oh!
Madrid.
Oh, my!
I can't believe we're really going.
Neither can I, but we're practically on our way.
Mother said she'd stay with the baby while we were gone.
Oh, aren't mothers wonderful?
Aw, they sure are.
She's taking an auto trip to New England with a chum of hers, but she said she'd be here the day before we leave.
She's so cute.
She said they had no idea where they were going, but when they came to an intersection, they were just gonna flip a coin.
Ah, your mother.
The coin won't be the only thing in that car that's flipped.
Hi.
Ricky home yet?
Not yet, no.
What's that?
Fred!
What are you doing with our old vaudeville trunk?
Well, as long as I'm Ricky's band manager, it's my job to save him some money.
So, I thought we could pack some of the band uniforms in here.
Oh, but it's so old and beat-up, and it's even got a hole in it!
"And it's even got a hole in it"!
I defy anyone to find that hole with the naked eye.
I said the naked eye, not two bony fingers.
If Ricky wants to use this, I'll patch it up again.
How'd that hole get in there anyway?
Oh, he bought it from a man who had a seal act.
Oh, fine.
Hey, Fred, here's the schedule for Europe.
Look.
First we go to London, then Paris Ah, Paris.
Get ready, you cute mademoiselles.
Corporal Mertz is gonna make his triumphant return.
Fred, you were there 35 years ago.
Yes, but I left a lasting impression.
By the way, where's that old uniform of mine?
Now, you're not gonna try to put that old thing on.
I just want to see it; it's full of memories.
Hi, everybody.
Hi.
Hi.
I got the boat tickets.
Oh, no kidding!
The boat tickets!
Now, all we got to do tomorrow is get our pass-a-ports.
Yeah, that's all we got to do now is get our "pass-a-ports.
" Europe, here we come!
Look out, Mademoiselle from Armentieres!
Honey, did you get my naturalization papers?
Yeah, I got them out of the safe deposit box this morning.
How about your birth certificate?
I wired the Jamestown Hall of Records, and they'll send it to me.
Good.
I got mine.
Ethel?
Yep.
I had to hunt for it, but I finally found it.
Show it to them, honey.
No.
She doesn't want us to see the year.
Put your finger over the year.
Thought they might like to see what Lincoln's signature looks like.
Oh, Fred!
Ha, ha!
He-he-he-hee.
The phone, honey.
Oh.
Hello Hey, what's that trunk?
Oh, that's my old vaudeville trunk.
I thought we could pack the band uniforms in there.
Hello?
Yes?
Oh, uh, just a minute, please.
Honey, it's a collect call for you from Jamestown Hall of Records.
Oh, must be about my birth certificate.
Hello?
Yes, I'll take the call.
Hello?
But there must be some mistake.
Well, my maiden name was Lucille McGillicuddy and I was born in Jamestown.
Well, I'm positive.
Well, I don't understand.
Oh, well, you misunderstood me.
Yes, you're looking under the wrong year.
Oh, yes, I was born in 19 I was born in 19  : 19 Look, you know the year you just mentioned?
Well, it's three more years than that.
No, no, no, not backwards, forwards.
Yeah, I'll hang on.
They were looking under the wrong year.
Really, honey?
What year were they looking under?
Oh, no, you don't.
Yes?
But there must be some mistake.
Well, I All right.
Thank you.
How do you like that?
What's the matter, honey?
They can't find my birth certificate.
There's no record.
Oh, there must be.
Well, there isn't.
If I'd known Jamestown was gonna be that careless, I'd have been born somewhere else.
Well, honey, you-you-you need your birth certificate if you want to get a passport.
Well, what do you want me to do?
They never heard of me.
Maybe you were never born.
I was, too.
Now, Fred.
I was only kidding her.
'Course you were born.
Well, you know it and I know it, but as far as Jamestown is concerned, the stork just dropped me and didn't tell anybody.
Now, look, honey, why don't you call your mother and ask her about it?
What's the matter?
I don't know where my mother is.
The whole family's disappearing right in front of our eyes.
Well, mother is on an auto trip up in New England or someplace.
She won't be here until the day before you leave.
I'm not going to get to go to Europe at all!
Now, honey, let me see.
I'll call the pass-a-port office.
I got their number right here.
Bon voyage, everybody.
Now, now, Lucy, it can't be that bad.
You don't know what it's like to be born a missing person.
Hello?
Pass-a-port office?
Look.
I'd like some information, please.
If you want to get a pass-a-port and you can't find your bir' certificate, what do you do?
Pass-a-port.
Bir' certificate.
Yes, yes, that's right.
Uh-huh.
What is it?
You get an affidavit from an older living blood relative.
Suppose you misplace your older living blood relative?
Well, you don't know this family.
Oh?
I see.
Oh, thank you very much.
Honey, all you got to is find two old friends of your family that remember who you were born and get an affidavit from them.
Oh, that'll be easy.
I do know a lot of people in Jamestown.
No, no.
Wait a minute now.
That name sounded familiar.
No.
You still on the phone?
Who are you talking to?
The Jamestown Hall of Records.
Oh.
Did you say Paul Jones?
No.
Richard Jones?
No.
Robert A. Jones?
Bob Jones, Bob Jones.
No.
What are they doing, reading you the whole directory?
Yes.
What?
!
Ah, uh, Mrs. Mell, I'll call you back.
You scared me.
Are you crazy or something?
That'll cost a fortune.
Well, I'm desperate.
I can't find a soul in Jamestown that knew me when I was born.
Now, look, honey, wasn't there a doctor there when you were born?
Yes.
I called Dr. Peterson, but he's visiting here in New York.
His daughter said she tried to get in touch with him and have him call.
Well, there you are.
No, there I'm not.
Even if he does call- there is a very good chance that he won't- I still need one more witness.
Well, you'll think of somebody, don't worry.
If I could just think of Helen Erickson's second husband's name.
Helen Erickson?
Yeah.
You don't know her.
She's a girl who used to live next door to us.
She used to baby-sit me when my folks wanted to go out.
Well Darn it.
She lives here in New York now, too.
Well, I got to go to the club, honey.
I'll see you later.
Her first husband's name was Sears.
You don't suppose her second husband's name could be No, I guess that's impossible.
Hi, Rick.
Hi.
Bye.
Bye.
Lucy, has Fred been over here?
No.
Wonder where he is.
Well, did you get your witnesses?
No.
Parlez-vous Mad'moiselle from Armentieres Parlez-vous Mad'moiselle from Armentieres She ain't been kissed in 40 years Hinky-dinky parlez-vous.
Fred, what are you doing in that?
I'm getting ready to burst upon Gay Paree.
Well, that's sure the outfit for it.
So it needs a little letting out here and there.
Now, don't make fun of us doughboys.
Dough boys?
!
Whoever put the dough in that boy used too much yeast.
It's a good thing that Kaiser didn't see you in that outfit.
He never would have surrendered.
Is that so?
Let me tell you what That's it!
That's what?
That's Helen's last name- Kaiser.
Helen married Sidney Kaiser.
What are you talking about?
Helen Kaiser is a girl who knew me when I was a baby.
She can sign one of the affidavits.
Oh, that's great.
Okay, Corporal, back to your barracks.
Hut, two, three, four!
Hut, two, three, four!
Hut, two, three, four!
Mad'moiselle from Armentieres Parlez-vous Mad'moiselle from Armentieres Parlez-vous Honey, you think she'll remember you?
Sure.
She was like a sister to me.
: Oh Hello?
I'd like to speak to Helen Kaiser, please.
Oh, hi, Helen!
This is Lucy Ricardo I mean, Lucille McGillicuddy from Jamestown.
Lucille McGillicuddy.
Used to live next door to you?
Well, Helen, do you remember a little skinny girl with freckles and red hair?
Well, do you remember a little skinny girl with freckles and brown hair?
Well, you used to kid me about my bloomers.
They were alway Yes!
This is Droopy Drawers!
Hi!
Yeah, yeah, it's been a long time, hasn't it?
Well, I'll tell you why I called, Helen.
You see we're going to Europe and I can't find my birth certificate, so I have to have someone sign an affidavit saying they knew when and where I was born.
Would you, Helen?
Oh, I'd appreciate it so much.
Could I come over now?
Oh, thank you.
Okay, bye.
She's gonna do it.
I'm halfway to Europe.
Oh, honey, that's wonderful.
Listen, I'll be gone about an hour.
Will you stay here until I get back?
Why?
The baby's in nursery school, isn't he?
In case Dr. Peterson calls.
I don't want to miss him.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Bye.
Good luck, Droopy Drawers.
Oh, come now!
Helen!
Droopy Drawers!
Oh, it's so good to see you.
You haven't changed a bit.
Neither have you : Well Ah, yeah, I know.
There have been a few color changes here and there, and I'm wearing better-fitting bloomers.
Oh, what a lovely apartment.
Oh, thank you.
You know, Lucy, ever since you called, I've been thinking about the old days when we used to live in Jamestown.
Those were the days, weren't they?
Yeah.
Lucy, do you remember the time your baby buggy got away from me?
No.
Well well, you were only about a year old.
Oh, well, I guess that's why I don't remember it.
Oh.
Well, anyway, I was pushing your buggy, and I stopped for a minute to go into a candy store.
And when I came out, the buggy had rolled all the way down the hill and was out in the middle of the street stopping traffic!
Oh, no!
It's a wonder we ever grew up, isn't it?
Yes.
Well, Helen, I'd just love to sit here all afternoon talking over old times with you, but I guess we'd better get this affidavit signed.
Oh, it's okay.
I typed it all up, and it just says that you knew my family for ages and ages and you remember when I was born.
Oh, good.
And you sign on the bottom line there.
Oh, fine.
I have a pen Oh, good.
right here.
There you are.
Hi, honey.
Oh!
Hello, Sidney.
Oh Hey  Mmm Darling, I want you to meet an old friend of mine, Lucy Ricardo.
This is Sidney.
Hello, Sidney.
Very nice to meet you.
Nice to know you, Lucy.
Lucy and I grew up together in Jamestown, and she came over to have me sign an affidavit for her.
Yes, I'm going to Europe.
Well, it's the silliest thing.
For some reason or other, there is just no record of my being born in Jamestown, so I can't get my birth certificate.
So, I have to have Helen swear that she remembers when I was born so I can get my passport.
You sign on the bottom line there, dear.
Okay.
Well, now, wait a minute, Helen.
You can't sign an affidavit just like that.
Well, why not?
Yeah, why not?
Well, an affidavit is sworn testimony.
It's it's testimony taken under oath.
That'd have to be witnessed by a notary public.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Well, I'll go get a notary public.
Oh, no, no, no, that won't be necessary.
Helen and I can take it down to my office.
We'll have it notarized tomorrow and mail it to you.
Yeah, Sidney is an attorney.
Well, how convenient having one right in the family!
They sure come in handy, don't they?
Honey?
Yes?
You can't sign this at all.
I can't?
Says here, Lucy, you were born in That's right.
: Ah, honey, you always were poor in arithmetic.
How old are you?
You'd have to have a pretty good memory.
You weren't even born until 1927.
Oh.
Oh, that's right!
But, Helen Oh, I thought that said 1931.
Helen?
Yes, dear?
I I don't want to contradict you in front of Sidney, and I don't know how you did it if you were just born 29 years ago, but you were there when I was born.
Lucy, that's impossible.
But, uh, well, what about the baby buggy?
Who was pushing whom?
Oh, oh, Daddy, you know, Lucy was a regular little mother.
She used to push me around when : She pushed me around when I was just a eensy-weensy little baby in a buggy.
Ew!
Well, Lucy, it must be great for you two to see each other again.
Tell me, has Helen changed much since she was a little child?
Not a bit.
She just never seems to get any older.
I know what you mean.
Ever since we've been married, she seems to be growing younger every day.
Yeah, I guess it's the marriage that did it.
You've no idea how much younger she's grown just since you walked into the room.
Lucy, we don't want to keep you.
If you want to run along Look, Helen, I really need this affidavit.
So, don't you think maybe you could sign it just for the sake of all those years that I baby-sat with you?
But that'd be perjury.
Lucy, you wouldn't want Helen to lie, would you?
Oh, heaven forbid!
Lucy, I hope you have a nice time in Europe.
It was awfully nice to have met you, Lucy.
Yeah.
Thanks.
And maybe we'll see you soon?
Oh, yes, you must come over for dinner sometime and bring your mother.
Hi, honey, Dr. Peterson called, and he's coming right over.
Swell.
What's the matter?
I'll still need another witness.
Why?
What happened with Helen Kaiser?
Helen Kaiser is a dirty rat.
She wouldn't sign the affidavit.
Her husband walked into the room and suddenly she became younger than I am.
She wouldn't admit her real age.
You're kidding.
How do you like that?
Oh, dear.
What are you gonna do now?
Well, I'll tell you one thing I'm not going to do.
I'm not going to let you three trot off to Europe without me even if I have to stowaway.
Oh, Lucy You know, this is about the right size at that.
Oh, now, Lucy, not in that trunk!
Why not?
Well, how could you breathe?
There's a hole in it.
Yes, and it matches the one in your head.
Listen, if a seal could live in here, I can.
Oh, dear.
I'm just gonna try it on for size.
Oh, Lucy, this is absolutely ridiculous!
It's a nice thing to sort of have around in case I can't get Oh, honey Now!
I'm just gonna see if I fit in here.
See?
I fit like a glove.
Yeah, but if the trunk was closed, you wouldn't last two minutes.
Oh, I would, too.
Go ahead, close it.
I'll show you.
Okay, but just to convince you.
Ethel, now, let me get my skirt out of the way.
Got it?
Yep.
Okay.
How's that?
Oh, come on now, it's awful, isn't it?
No, it's very cozy in here.
Cozy.
It is!
It's quite comfortable.
We should all go to Europe this way and save the fare.
Sure, if you could get a whole bunch of Ethel, let me out of here.
I thought so.
Hey, it's locked.
Wasn't there a key?
Sure, there's a key.
I got it.
I got it?
!
Oh, now, don't get nervous, honey.
Just poke it out through the hole and get you right out of there.
Oh, okay.
Oh.
Oh!
What's the matter?
Ethel, th-the key's in my pocket and I can't move my arms!
What?
!
My arms are pinned down to my side!
Oh, Lucy, only you would get yourself locked in a trunk with the key in your pocket.
Oh, well, don't scold me.
I got to get out of here.
I don't want Ricky to come over and find out that I planned to stowaway.
Go get Fred.
Okay, honey.
Hurry up.
All right, I'll hurry.
Now you wait right there!
All right, I'll do that!
Oh, uh : Hello, Ricky!
Hi, Ethel.
What's the matter?
Oh, uh, uh, uh you just startled me, that's all.
Where's Lucy?
: Uh, uh, uh Why?
Well, I'm married to her and I live here.
When I come home, I like to know where she is, you know.
Oh, of course you do.
Well, you know Lucy.
She's just liable to be anywhere.

Double tempo, huh.
Double tempo.
That's good.
Now the very end of that.
You know?
Here we go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Now, that's the tempo we should do.
How's that?
Hey, this trunk has a pretty good tone.
Bueno Desi que yo tengo que ir.

Tiene que ir?
Va entrar el tiempo Well, yo voy contigo ahi al subway.
Tengo que comprar un evening paper.
Oh, I thought they'd never leave.
Lucy, I can't find Fred anywhere.
Lucy?
Lucy, are you all right?
Somebody talking to me?
Are you all right?
Huh?
Are you all right?
I can't hear a thing.
Ricky just beat out a concerto for piano and trunk.
Oh, I heard it, you poor little thing.
Don't bother.
I'll get it.
Yes?
Lucille McGillicuddy!
My gosh, I'd know you anywhere.
Oh, no, I'm not Lucille.
I'm Ethel Mertz.
: Oh, I don't have my glasses on.
Oh, you must be Dr. Peterson.
Yep.
Hello, Doc.
Who said that?
Lucy.
She's in the trunk.
Oh, hello, hello.
Hello.
Ethel, go get a notary public.
Where'll I get a notary public?
At the bank.
Okay.
Whup-up-up-up-up.
I couldn't sign anything until I'm sure that she's really Lucille McGillicuddy.
Oh, no, I am, Dr. Peterson.
I am.
I'm Lucille McGillicuddy.
Well, I don't know.
Uh, I thought she was you at first.
Oh, no, now, you could see her.
There's a hole right there in the trunk.
You look right through there, you can see that that's Lucy.
Well, I'll take a look.
Hi.
I can't tell a thing.
Oh, now, wait a minute, Doc.
Wait a minute.
Here's one of my eyes.
Here's my other eye.
Here's my nose.
Here's my mouth.
Put them all together and they spell Lucille McGillicuddy.
All that is is an eye, an eye, a nose and a mouth.
I've seen so many.
Oh Well, I know.
Listen, Doc, I-I was bitten by a cat once on my ear and-and you took some stitches in it, remember?
Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, that I remember.
It was Fred Bigelow's cat.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, look, maybe you can see the scar.
Ah wait a minute.
Scar or no scar, you couldn't be Lucille McGillicuddy.
She had brown hair.
Look at the roots- the roots!
Oh, never mind, Ethel.
It's no use.
I'm never gonna get out of this trunk as long as I live.
Don't cry, honey.
It won't do any good.
Goodness, no, don't cry.
Ethel, I need a handkerchief.
Oh, all right, honey.
Here.
Aw, let me have your nose.
Thank you.
Well, now, will you please go get Fred?
Well, I'll try to find him again.
I'll be right back, Dr. Peterson.
Hurry up.
Hey, young lady?
I just remembered	What?
how you can absolutely identify yourself for me.
How?
Well, when you was a little girl, I taught you a song we sang together.
Do you remember?
Yes.
Yes, I do!
Well, if you can sing that song all the way through with me, like you used to, you must be Lucille McGillicuddy.
Oh, I-I-I can.
Just let me think a minute.
Oh um uh Oh, yeah.
Uh  Flies in the buttermilk, shoo, fly, shoo Flies in the buttermilk shoo, fly, shoo Skip to the Lou Lou, my darling My darling Flies in the sugar bowl, shoo, fly, shoo Skip to my Lou, my darling!
LUCY AND  Skip to my Lou, my darling!
I got a red bird, a pretty one, too LUCY AND  Skip to my Lou, my darling!
What's going on here?
I'm locked in the trunk, honey.
This is Dr. Peterson from Jamestown.
How do how do you do?
How do you do?
I'm the doctor who brought your wife into the world.
Oh, you are.
Well, I don't know whether to thank you or punch you in the nose.
Lucy, what are you doing in that trunk?
Oh, just packing a few things.
Come on, Fred, hurry up.
She's been in here so long, I got Fred, hurry up.
Fred, hurry up.
Well, now, wait a minute.
What do you mean, wait a minute?
Well, maybe we can do this without damaging the trunk.
Oh, Ricky, help him.
She was in there when you were beating on the top.
Oh, hurry up.
Wait a minute.
Hurry up.
Look out for your hand, Fred.
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Yes.
Oh, are you all right, honey?
Are you all right?
There you go.
Got it.
Okay.
There you go.
Oh, honey!
Are you all right?
Oh, was it awful?
Well, it's a nice place to visit- I wouldn't want to live there.
Hiya, Doc.
Lucy McGillicuddy!
I thought you'd be bigger by now.
Will somebody mind telling me what's going on here?
Why?
You'll never believe it.
Well, now I Whoa.
Thanks, Doc.
I, uh I just figured maybe I'd have to stowaway if I want to get to Europe, and I I knew that a seal could live in there, so I supposed maybe I could, and when I tried it on for size, I got locked in it.
What makes you think I wouldn't believe that?
Oh, Doc, have you any idea why there is no record of my being born in Jamestown?
Jamestown?
You weren't born in Jamestown.
What?
You were born in West Jamestown.
Oh West Jamestown!
West Jamestown!
Oh, for heaven's sake.
You don't know what I've gone through.
I didn't even know there was a West Jamestown.
Honey, it's a special delivery letter there for you.
H- Honestly, Doc, you don't know How do you like that?
what we've gone through.
We've been calling the Hall of Records for one solid Oh, it's from Mother.
What'd she say?
"We had car trouble and got stuck overnight "in West Jamestown, so I picked this up.
Hope you can use it.
" What is it?
My birth certificate!
Oh Oh!
Oh West Jamestown.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Yes, Marion, we're taking off for Europe next week.
Well, I'm so excited, I can hardly stand it.
Oui, oui!
That's French, you know.
Yes, yes, we're all studying different languages, so we can act as guides in different countries.
Uh-huh, I'm taking French and Fred's studying German and Ethel's learning how to speak Italian.
Ricky?
Oh, he's learning how to speak English.
Ha, ha, ha!
No, he's going to take over when we get to Spain.
Well, now, au revoir, Madame Van Vlack.
A bientot.
That means "good-bye, I'll see you later.
" Okay, ooh-la-la, Marion.
Love to Norma.
Oh, I'm not going to argue with you any longer.
You're acting just like a child.
I don't care how I'm acting; It's the truth.
Uh bonjour, Mama.
Bonjour, Papa.
Mama?
Papa?
Well, I haven't learned how to say "Fred" and "Ethel" in French.
How do you say "seasick" in French?
Oh, will you stop harping on that.
What's wrong?
He's afraid he's gonna get seasick on the boat.
Oh, Fred, that's silly.
It is not.
You were on a boat when you went to France during the First World War, weren't you?
Yeah, but believe me, it wasn't my idea.
And you came back on a boat, too, didn't you?
Only because my top sergeant had a bayonet in my back.
Oh, Fred.
Look, it's different nowadays on these big ocean liners.
It's so smooth, you don't even feel a ripple, and, remember, we're going on the Constitution, one of the best.
Sure.
It's all in your mind.
Just don't think about it.
You'll be all right.
Well This is a terrible time to get a case of jitters.
We've made all the arrangements.
We've sat for our passport photos.
We've had our overseas shots.
Okay, okay.
But I still wish there was a way of getting to Europe by bus!
Fred, don't forget we're depending on you to be our guide in Germany.
Have you been studying your German?
Ja wohl, fraulein.
Hey, that's wonderful.
Giemen a sie, me a ein stein Wurzburger.
Oh, great!
What does that mean?
What do you think it means?
"Give me a glass of beer.
" Is that all he's learned?
Nope.
He's learned how to order nine different kinds of beer.
Oh, we're gonna have an interesting time in Germany.
Never mind, now.
You're not doing so hot with your Italian.
Is that so?
By the time we get to Italy, you won't be able to tell me from Gina Lollobrigida.
Well, gieben sie me a Gina Lollobrigida.
Oh, shuttenze up.
How are you doing with your French, honey?
Fine.
I've mastered the two most important sentences in the language.
What were they?
"How much is that dress in the window"?
And "Wrap it up.
I'll take it.
" Well, I have a feeling that Ricky will know the French for "Take it back.
It's too expensive.
" Yeah.
I'll bet he does.
Hi.
Hi, Honey.
Hello, Rick.
Hey, I got our pass-a-port pictures.
Oh, passport pictures!
Let me	 Let's see mine.
see 'em.
Look pretty good.
Every one except mine.
Yeah?
Let me see yours, hon.
Hey, that's pretty good of you.
That's you.
Me?
Here, oh, oh, look, this is you.
I got them all mixed up.
Give me me.
Here, honey, this is you.
I guess this is yours.
I look like Frankenstein.
Well, shake hands with your bride.
Let me see that one of you.
Hey, that looks more like me than the one of me does.
You want to trade?
Fred, let me see yours.
Yeah.
I don't think that's very bad, do you?
No, that's not so bad.
That's very realistic.
I look like a fist with eyes.
You're the one that got the good one.
Mm Yeah, that's not bad, Ethel.
I think he's captured the real you.
Is that so?
If I thought I really looked like this, I wouldn't blame Fred if he walked out on me right this minute.
Good-bye!
Come back here.
Let me see yours, Ricky.
Oh, it's terrible.
Oh, I think that's pretty cute.
Honey, that's good.
I look all right, but my hair looks so funny.
What's the matter with it?
I look like I had a head full of chocolate fudge.
: Chocolate fudge.
Well, now that we've all looked at each other's pictures Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Come on now, come on.
Yeah, let's see yours.
Oh, now, you don't want to see them.
Come on now.
Why, honey, I think that's pretty cute.
That's not bad.
Oh, it's terrible.
Looks like my face was put on hot and it ran.
Well, that's the way the pictures came out.
So what are you going to do about it?
I know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to find another photographer and have some more pictures made right now.
So am I. Good.
I'll go put on a new face.
Just a minute.
You mean you've had a new face at home all this time and you're still wearing that one?
Oh, Fred!
Hey, listen.
We really should go and get our pass-a-ports this morning.
Well, you and Fred go.
We want to get some decent pictures.
Absolutely.
Well And, honey, don't worry about the baby.
I'm gonna leave him at nursery school all day.
All right.
I'll see you later.
Right.
Feminine vanity.
Yeah.
What's the difference what your pass-a-port picture looks like?
I'm gonna use this thing right here.
Let me see.
I think I'll use this, too.
No, I guess I'd better use my own.
I look so much better than this picture, it'll give them a thrill just to see me in person.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Mr. Emory.
Yes well, we have to go down to the pass-a-port office.
That's down your way, so we'll stop by.
Sure, we'd love to see you.
Thank you.
That's Mr. Emory of the American Export Line.
He wants us to go down to the boat, and he'll show us where the boys are gonna play and, uh, the accommodations and stuff.
Well, let's away!
Okay.
Well, it's no use, Ethel.
Well, you'd think with your own photographer and 50 different poses apiece, we would have gotten at least one good picture.
I just don't understand it.
This is the same photographer that took our wedding pictures 15 years ago and we looked great.
Well, I guess they're just not making cameras like they used to.
Hey, I just had a horrible thought.
What?
Maybe we really look like this.
Bite your tongue.
Well, what are we gonna do now?
Well, either find another photographer or a plastic surgeon.
You'll be all right.
Don't worry.
What's the matter with Fred?
What's the matter with Fred, Ricky?
What's the matter with him?
Well I'll tell you what happened.
We went down to the SS Constitution.
Oh, no.
Now, Fred, don't tell me you got seasick.
It was 1918 all over again.
Well, honey, was it rough?
Rough?
The boat was tied to the dock.
It was absolutely still.
Fred, it's impossible to get seasick on a boat that is standing still.
Tell that to my stomach.
Well, Fred, if you're gonna get seasick on a boat that's tied to the dock, what are you gonna do when you get in the middle of the ocean?
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do: I'm not going.
Oh, Fred, you don't mean that.
Ethel, there's no way to get me on that boat.
Where can I buy a bayonet?
Now, Fred, you'll be all right once we get underway.
I'm not going.
You've got to go.
You're the band manager.
I'm sorry, I get seasick.
If I miss this trip on account of you, I'll make you landsick.
What a horrible choice to have to make.
Now, look, what's the matter with everyone?
What about those new, wonderful, seasick pills that they have now?
Sure!
They work great.
Well Oh, come on, Fred.
Say you'll go.
What have you got to lose?
Don't ask me that right now.
Did you have to say that?
No, Fred, really, those pills will work great.
Well, suppose they don't!
Well, take some and try it.
Now, take some pills and go for a ride on the Staten Island Ferry.
Yeah.
Will you go with me?
I'm not gonna face the raging seas of New York Harbor alone.
Sure I will, honey.
I'm gonna be busy this afternoon, but tomorrow morning, we'll get up Hey, listen, you got you-you This afternoon you gotta go get your passports.
We do?
Yes.
We were just down there.
The man says that you had- this the last day if you want to be in time to sail.
What time does the office close?
Oh, dear, I gotta go over and get Aunt Martha's luggage for the trip.
Lucy, will you baby-sit with Commodore Squeamish here on the Staten Island Ferry?
Sure.
Okay, I'll see you at the passport office.
All right.
Come on, Fred.
Oh, Ethel!
What?
We don't have any decent pictures.
Hey, here's two good ones, right here.
How can you say these are good?
Because either you use these, or you don't go.
Oh, well, by George, these are kind of good.
Oh, I must admit that one Oh, this is really good.
I'll see you at the passport office, honey.
Yeah, come on, Fred.
Come on.
Listen, you can buy those pills in any drugstore.
They'll work great.
Well, if they don't, you can wave good-bye to me now, because they'll never get me off of Staten Island.
Oh, Fred, you're gonna take those pills and you're gonna be all right.
You just relax now, Fred.
Those pills are gonna work great.
Yeah, you know, I think they've commenced to work already.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm not seasick.
Good.
I'm not one bit seasick.
I feel great!
I- I never felt better in my life.
I'm not seasick.
Okay, boy, okay, wait till the boat leaves.
Yeah.
Gee, those pills sure relax you.
They do, huh?
Yeah.
You can let go now, Fred.
Fred, let go.
Come on, straighten up.
Relax.
Take your hands off.
Attaboy.
Relax, now, relax.
There.
How do you feel?
Oh, I feel fine.
Well, you don't look fine.
Come on, smile.
Aah, I don't want to jinx it.
Aw, come on.
Come on, boy, smile for me.
Attaboy, attaboy.
There.
You're not gonna mind this trip at all.
Nope.
No.
Gee, look at all those whitecaps out there.
Yeah.
Real wavy and choppy, isn't it?
Yeah.
Up we go and down we go and up we go and down Gee, you feel fine, don't you, Fred?
Yeah.
Up we go and down we go and You're not going to mind this trip at all, Fred?
Nope.
All you have to do is take a big, deep breath of fresh air.
Nothing like the ocean air to pep you up and make you ship-shape.
Yeah.
Oh What's the matter?
Nothing.
Now, you don't have to pretend with me.
I've been on the other side of that green face.
No, really, I I feel oh Oh, now, steady, honey, steady.
It's all in your mind.
Never mind your philosophy.
Just give me some of your pills.
Oh.
Yeah.
Here.
I only took two of those.
Oh, I only took five or six.
This is an emergency.
Now, don't take any more.
They make you awful sleepy.
Yeah, well, I don't care what they do just so long as they settle Oh Hold on!
Honey, steady, steady.
Hon Come on, honey, let's go over and sit down.
I think I'd better stay right over here.
Let's sit down.
Come on!
There.
Don't you feel any better?
Well, I don't feel any worse.
So, compared to the way I was feeling, I I'm feeling better, yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I-I guess I'm gonna get to make that trip to Europe after all.
Yeah, well, have a good time.
Yeah?
Well, it's 4:15 already.
Hasn't Lucy even called?
I haven't heard a word from her.
I can't even get my own passport.
Somebody has to identify me.
Look, I'll right come down there and identify you.
What do you think could have happened to Lucy and Fred?
I don't know, unless the seasick pills didn't work and she can't get Fred off of Staten Island.
Now, I'll be right down.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
Bye.
Come on, sir.

When the 5:00 whistle blows, so do I. I am not leaving this office until I get my passport.
This office closes at 5:00 if I have to eject you forcibly.
You just try it.

Six minutes!

All she has to do is sign them and be sworn in.
And identify you.
I'll identify her.
I'm her husband.

Mmm Whoa!
Honey   She's coming to.
She's coming to right now.
Ah, you're coming to?
You waking up, baby?
Yeah?
Oh, she looks fine, looks fine.
She's awake, Rick.
Come on.
Okay, honey.
Come on.
There.
That's it.

Ohh!
Good job!
You did it!
You made it!
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Oh, that was great, honey.
You did just fine now.
Come on.
This way, baby.
Yeah, come on, honey, now we got it all fixed up.
Everything is straightened out.
I never thought we had time to make it.
I didn't think we had time.
Everything's all right now.
Rick, you were just great.
It was just wonderful.
Hey!
You can go now.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Shall we say good-bye from here?
Huh?
What did you say, Mother?
Shall we say good-bye from here?
No!
Come on.
You can come on the boat.
Sure.
Oh, bye!
Good-bye!
This is ours, right?
Oh, honey, look at the beautiful stateroom!
Hey, how about this, huh?
Look at the things everybody sent us.
Yeah.
Oh, look at this extravaganza.
"Bon voyage from Billy, Danny and little Jerry Asher.
" Ha, ha!
Isn't that nice?
Oh, gosh.
What a boat this is!
It has a ballroom, a theater, some shops and even elevators!
I know.
Isn't it great?
It's just like a big hotel floating along on the waves.
Oh, that reminds me, Lucy.
I brought the bottle of of seasick pills you wanted.
Oh, thank you, Mother.
Oh You won't need those.
Well, I know, but my stomach will rest easier if my mind knows they're here.
Uh, Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes, dear?
I wonder if you'd do me a little favor while you're in Paris.
Well, of course, I will, Mrs. Trumbull.
What is it?
Will you buy me a bottle of French perfume?
You know I will, but it'll be a present from us.
Oh, no.
Now, I insist.
What kind of perfume do you want?
My Sin?
!
Oh  Now, Lucy, I want you to just enjoy yourself and don't worry about a thing.
Oh, I can't see Lucy not worrying about the baby.
Well, I'll relax if you promise to cable me if he even sneezes.
What are you gonna do, cable back "gesundheit"?
Well, I just want to know, that's all.
Oh, we have a phone!
You can call me every day.
Oh, I can't call you when you're at sea.
Oh, yes, you can, but it's pretty expensive.
Well, make it station-to-station.
That way, it'll be cheaper.
And I know I'm I'm always gonna be home.
What's the number?
There's no number, Mother.
You call the marine operator and ask for the Constitution.
But let me put it this way: Don't call us, we'll call you.
Well, maybe not for just a sneeze, but anything important, huh, Mom?
Okay, okay.
All ashore that's going ashore.
Oh, dear.
Uh-oh.
Let me kiss him good-bye.
Come on, son.
Give us a kiss good-bye, honey.
Good-bye?
Good-bye?
Where's everybody going?
Huh?
Where's everybody going?
Well, the man says all ashore who's going ashore.
Oh, they start that long before you have to get off.
Oh.
Honey, he said they start that long before they have to get off.
Oh, well, good, that'll give me a few more minutes with the baby, then.
Say, how do you like your stateroom?
Oh, it's just gorgeous!
It's just right down the hall.
Band manager reporting, sir.
All members present and accounted for.
At ease, Mr. Manayer.
Ah, did you hear that, honey?
Your papa has a band "manayer.
"  For heaven's sake, Ethel, can't you wait?
You've been spoiling the looks of the basket.
Oh, I can't help it.
This sea air makes me hungry.
We haven't even left the dock.
: Well, we haven't even left the dock.
Wait till she finds out the food's free.
Could be the biggest bundle Britain's ever seen.
All ashore that's going ashore.
Uh-oh, I think this is it, honey.
We'd better go.
We'd better go now.

Good-bye!
Bye, Mrs. Trumbull!
Now, that's more your speed.
Good-bye!

It's wonderful.
Well, Mr. Ricardo Yes.

It'll only take just a moment.
All right.
Fred, will you come with me?
Okay, Rick.
See you in a minute, honey.
Oh, Lucy, isn't this great?
What's the matter, honey?
I miss the baby.
Oh now, it's not gonna be for very long.
I just gotta give him one more kiss.

Mother Mother let me give the baby a kiss.
What are you doing down here?
Oh, I just had to give him one more hug.
Now, stop being silly, you'll miss The boat.
Oh, you don't know what it's like to be a mother, Mother.
Sweetheart, that's my good little baby.
Now, you be a good little angel and I'll bring you lots of things from Europe, honey.

It's no use.
I can't get it unhooked.
Come on now, really try.
Hey, wait a minute!
Where do you think you're going?
I've got to get on this boat.
Not with my bike, you don't.
Oh, after all, this is just a bicycle, for heaven's sake.
I can't miss the boat.
This bike is more important to me than that boat.
Oh Stop the boat!
Oh!
Have you got a knife?
No, but here's a pencil.
I don't want to write a letter!
Hold the boat!

The boat went without me, Mother!
There must be something we can do.
Somebody will think of something, Lucy.
Officer!
Officer!
Officer, my wife is on the docks!
Stop the ship!
Well, now, that's impossible, sir.
But-but look Everything's gonna be all right, sir.
She can come out on the pilot boat and come aboard when the pilot gets off.
Oh, you can come on the pilot boat!
Wait a minute.
What?
Come out on the pilot boat, honey!
On the pilot She can't hear me.
You can telephone the dock agent.
He'll page her.
Oh, okay.
Ricky's gonna call somebody to help you!
Oh Oh, these things happen.
Hello?
Operator?
Operator?
Hagame favor de darme aqui el dock Me haga favor- de darme el dock y que Oh Give me the dock agent, please.
Dock agent speaking.
Say, Doc, will you?
Will you please page Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, please?
Yes, sir.
One moment, please.
Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, please report to the dock agent's desk.
Mrs. Ricky Ricardo, please report to the dock agent's desk.
I'm Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
It's for you.
Oh, thank you.
Hello?
Honey, this is Ricky!
Oh, Ricky Now, honey, get-get ahold of yourself.
I missed the boat.
I'm not gonna be able to go to Europe at all.
Now, honey, listen to me.
Ricky Lis Oh, Ricky Honey, you can Honey, you can come out on the pilot boat.
I can come out on what?
: You can come out on the pilot boat!
The pilot boat?
Yes.
Well, where do I get it?
Ask the dock agent.
Oh, okay.
And hurry!
Yeah, honey.
Where can I get the-the pilot boat for the Constitution?
You get down to the end of the pier, turn right, and then after about 30 yards down, you'll see a ramp that leads down to a lower level.
On the lower level, you'll see a little pier that has two boats tied to it.
Yeah.
Those are the pilot boats.
Oh, uh, uh, the end of the pier, uh, lower level, two boats.
You'd better hurry.
Yeah.
They'll be leaving right away.
Pardon me, mister.
Mrs. Ricardo, what happened?
Have you got a pilot boat that goes to the pilot boat?
You didn't miss it?
Oh, didn't I?
Well, what happened?
Well, I'll tell you.
You may not believe it, but I'll tell you.
I went down to the end of the pier.
I ran 30 yards to the right.
I ran down the ramp to the lower level.
I saw the little pier with the two little boats tied to it, and one of them was on its way.
So, I raced to the end of the pier and I made a flying leap across and landed ker-plunk on the deck.
Well, then what are you doing here?
That boat was on the way in!
No.
What about the other boat?
By the time I noticed my mistake, it was gone.
What do I do now?
The Independence is leaving in a couple days.
Maybe you can I want to go on the Constitution so I can be with my husband, so I can be with my friends, so I can eat my bon voyage fruit before it all gets spoiled.
I'm sorry, lady, but Wait a minute.
There might be a way.
How?
How?
Just a month ago, we had a passenger miss this same boat.
He hired a helicopter and flew out to it.
Oh, that's wonderful!
All right, where do I get one?
Idyllwild Airport.
Oh, boy, a helicopter!
A helicopter?
!
You see Lucy yet?
No.
Wait till they get a little closer.
Lucy's Lucy's not on that boat!
No, she isn't!
Maybe she's in the wheelhouse.
:	  Ahoy there!
Hey!
: Hey!
He hears you.
Have you got a woman on that boat?
What, are you a private detective or something?
Big joker.
No.
My wife, she missed this boat!
She missed this one, too, buddy.
How could Lucy miss that boat, too?
!
She's Lucy.
Does that answer your question?
Well, there's one other chance, Mr. Ricardo.
What's that?
About a month ago, one of our passengers missed the boat, and he hired a helicopter and flew out.
A helicopter?
I don't know.
I don't like the idea of Lucy taking a helicopter.
That's too risky.
Yeah, for the helicopter.
Oh, come on now, Ricky.
It's the only way.
Well where can we get one?
Well, we'll have to call Idlewild Airport.
Okay.
Yeah Why don't you come with me.
Oh, Fred, what if Lucy misses the helicopter?
Well, if I know Lucy, she'll grease her body and swim after it.
Yes, madam?
I want to rent a helicopter.
Oh, I'm sorry, our helicopter is being used right now.
Oh, darn it.
I should have called.
Isn't it a shame?
It was sitting here all morning, and now it's just taking off on an emergency call.
Well, I'm an emergency, too.
When will it be back?
Oh, I don't know, ma'am.
It's leaving right now to pick up some crazy dame who missed the SS Constitution.
Well, get it back!
Get it back!
But, ma'am I'm that crazy dame.
Get it back!
Come back!
Joe, Joe, radio the copter to come back to the field immediately.
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Oh, well, don't just stand there!
Do something!
Get that plane back here!
I just did.
I've got to get on that ship.
My husband's on that ship.
My friends are on that ship.
We've planned to go to Europe for You just did?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, thank you!
Thank you!
I, uh, beg your pardon, madam, but, uh, your slip is showing.
Yeah, I know, and I I tore it, too when I jumped for the pilot boat.
You jumped right out of your skirt?
Uh, no.
I had to take it off.
I got it caught in a bicycle.
Oh, I see.
Uh, would you allow me to get some some coveralls?
Oh, would you?
I'd appreciate it so much.
Thank you.
Would you make that a size 12, please?
Yes.
And maybe in charcoal gray so it would match what I'm wearing.
Well, this is my first time on a luxury liner, and I don't don't want to look tacky going aboard.
Have we left yet?
Left?
We're a thousand feet in the air.
Oh oh!
Relax, Mrs. Ricardo.
Relax.
Well, I'll try, but I've never been up in a helicopter before.
Well, I guess it is a little different from those big airliners.
I got news for you: I've never been in one of those either.
Now, there's no reason to be frightened.
Please, Mrs. Ricardo, try to relax and enjoy it.
Yeah, I'll I'll try to relax, but I don't think I'm gonna enjoy it.
Where's the door?
!
The door's gone!
Well, we took it off, so it would be easier for you to get out.
Right now I'm just concerned with staying in.
Well, Mrs. Ricardo, just settle back and take a look at the view.
Gee, all you can see is water.
That's right.
Except for that cigar someone threw away.
Mrs. Ricardo, that cigar is your ship.
That dainty little thing?
It's the SS Constitution.
Gee, the water must have shrunk it.
Well, it will get a little bigger as we get down closer to it.
Oh.
Pretty good-size cigar, isn't it?
Yeah.
Now it's beginning to look like a ship with little ants running all over it.
You'd better start getting ready.
Oh.
Okay.
How do I look?
No, no, no.
I mean your harness.
Is it on tight?
You mean my safety belt?
Oh, that isn't a safety belt.
That's a harness.
A harness?
What do I need a harness for?
When we land, I just step out, don't I?
We're not allowed to land.
Not allowed to land?
!
No.
You mean we can't land on that deck?
No, it's against the rules.
I hover over the boat and lower you down on a cable.
You hover over where and lower who on a what?
Now, Mrs. Ricardo, it's done all the time.
Not to me, it isn't.
You turn this eggbeater around and go back to the airport.
Well, I-I can assure you it's perfectly safe.
It's up to you.
You want to get down to that boat, this is the only way to do it.
You hover over the-the ship and-and-and lower me on-on something, and then Either that or back to the airport.
Well Now fasten that hook to your belt.
What hook?
That hook right out there.
That one?
Yeah.
I can't reach it.
Wait a minute.
I'll release it for you.
There.
You got it?
Yeah.
Don't push!
I'm not ready yet!
I was trying to tell you to throw your legs over the side and jump out, and I gradually lower I jump out?
!
Yeah.
Now sit down on the edge put your feet over and jump out.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
Yes, you can.
No.
Are you sure this cable's strong enough?
Yes, of course.
Well, all right.
I can't do it!
You're going to have to give me a push.
Okay.
I'll count to three.
Okay.
One two Wait a minute!
I got an idea.
What?
Have you, by any chance, got enough gasoline to fly me all the way to Europe?
No, I'm afraid not.
Well, maybe you can borrow some from the captain of the boat.
I'll pay for it.
I got a credit card.
Money's no object.
Mrs. Ricardo, this is the only way.
Now, wait a minute.
Think.
Maybe you'll get an idea.
Haste makes waste, you know?
Now, come on.
We're almost over the ship.
Now out you go.
One, two, three.
Are you all right?
Huh?
You all set?
Yeah.
Okay.
Here we go.
Lucy!
Honey, hold on to that rope!
Honey!
Fred, look at her hang off of that rope.
Come on!
Honey, over here!
Come on!
Come on, honey!
You all right, honey?
Whoa!
Come on!
Come on, bring her down!
Honey, are you all right?
Oh.
Oh.
I got it.
You get it?
Oh Good-bye.
Oh, he was the nicest pilot.
He didn't want me to do that, but I said, "Oh " Are you all right?
Oh, sure.
I'm fine.
There was nothing to Well, I'm here, aren't I?
Oh, the poor thing.
Mrs. Anderson, please come to the purser's office.
Will Mrs. Anderson please come to the purser's office.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Did you see the ship's newspaper?
No.
They just raved about your new MGM record of "Forever, Darling.
" No kidding.
Yeah.
They said it's gonna be one of the top records of the year.
Well.
Did you bring any records with you?
Yeah.
Well, let's get them to play it on the public address system.
Oh, no.
Oh, why not?
Well, that wouldn't be right.
Oh, now, I know how modest you are, but think what a treat it would be for the passengers.
Oh, honey.
Forever, darling.
Well, I Oh, shh While other hearts go wandering You'll find mine as faithful as can be.
Forever, forever, my darling I'll be your true love Forever and forever.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Sailing, sailing over the bounty main     Hi!
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Oh, gee, isn't it wonderful being onboard ship?
Oh, I'll say it is.
Weren't we lucky to have such wonderful weather!
It's just sensational.
Where were you?
We waited for you in the dining room.
Oh, Ricky and I had breakfast in here.
It was so romantic.
Just the two of us.
Come on in, honey.
Okay.
Ahoy!
Ha, ha!
Gee, I feel wonderful.
This trip's gonna be like a second honeymoon.
Don't you feel that way, Ethel?
You forget I'm married to Fred.
Can you imagine anything making him romantic?
I can just see the two of you, after a couple of days at sea, standing at the rail in the moonlight, you'll be holding his hand.
If we're standing by the rail, I'll be holding his head.
Or he'll be maneuvering to throw me overboard.
Ha, ha!
Well, for Ricky and me, it's gonna be just one long romantic interlude- five whole days of being together and having nothing to do but fun.
Will you wave to me once in a while so I won't get lonely?
Oh, you gotta put Fred in the mood.
How?
Well, look, here's the ship's newspaper- a whole schedule of activities.
I'm gonna sign Ricky and me up for everything.
Fred won't go for any of that stuff.
Well, then, you just come along with us.
Oh, fine, just what you've always wanted on your second honeymoon- a chaperon.
Well, don't worry, it'll all work out.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi, honey.
Gee, are we gonna have a wonderful day!
Look at this schedule.
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.
I got a schedule, too.
Listen to this.
Well, honey, are you gonna be that busy every day?
I'm afraid so.
Well, aren't you gonna get any time for any of these things?
I'm afraid not, honey.
Oh can't you Ping one little Pong?
Now, look, honey, when we first talked about this trip, I said that I was gonna be very busy and I wouldn't have much time to spend with you.
And you said, "That's all right, dear.
" And I said, "Are you sure"?
And you said What did you do- tape-record the whole conversation?
Now, Lucy, that's the way it's gotta be, so why don't you make the best of it, huh?
Well Come on, give me a smile.
Come on!
That's my girl.
Oh, you mean on the whole trip, I'm not gonna be ab What happened with that smile?
You mean on the whole trip, I'm not gonna be able to see you at all?
Come on, come on.
Be a good girl.
Maybe after we're out at sea for a couple of days, I can get some time off.
I'll see you later.
Oh  Some second honeymoon.
I might not even gonna see my husband for five days.
Well, look at it like this.
You haven't lost a husband.
You've gained a Ping-Pong partner- me.
Well, I guess you're better than nothing.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, I didn't really mean that.
I can't afford to offend you.
Oh, that's all right.
I can't afford to be offended.
Hmm.
Well, I'll change my clothes.
We might as well sign up for something.
Oh, that's gonna be great.
Two lonely dames.
Oh, there you are, baby doll.
I've been looking all over this boat for you, you little dickens.
Come on, honeybunch, let's not waste one single precious second of this trip.
Fred, what's in those seasick pills you've been taking?
Now, sweetie pie, is that any way for you to talk to your apple dumpling?
Fred, what's the matter with you?
Nothing, sweetheart.
It's this ocean voyage, the sea air, you and I together.
It just gets me.
Yeah, in the head.
Now, listen, Ethel, this could be a second honeymoon, so don't louse it up.
Wait a minute.
Fred, do you really mean it?
Of course I do, honey.
Look, we can play in all these tournaments and win them.
Now, will you come with me?
Oh, anywhere, honey, anywhere.
Goodie!
Goodie!
Goodie!
Okay, Ethel, I'm ready.
Oh, hi, Fred.
Hi!
What?
Lucy?
I guess you'll have to find yourself another Ping-Pong partner.
How come?
Well, we're gonna be on our second honeymoon, too.
The lovebug has bitten my Freddie.
The lovebug?
I thought Fred had been vaccinated for that.
Honeybun, I'll go and get my sneakers and then we'll sign up for the Ping-Pong tournament.
Bye-eee.
Bye-eee.
Why, isn't he cute?
Cute?
Oh, boy, if the sea air affects him like this when we get back to New York, I'm gonna sell the apartment building and buy a houseboat.
Well, I hope you two lovebirds will be very happy.
Oh, come on, honey, you can play the games with us.
Oh, no, no, three's a crowd.
Oh, come on now, we'll get you another partner.
No.
Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Osterlander III- Ping-Pong.
Yes, sir?
Well, we'd like to sign up.
Mr. And Mrs. Fred Mertz.
Ping-Pong, shuffleboard, deck tennis or bridge?
Yes, sir.
Oh, you want to sign up for all of them, huh?
Isn't that right, honeybunch?
That's right, honey.
Newlyweds?
Well, this is a second honeymoon.
Isn't it, babykins?
Yes, it is.
All right, Mr. and Mrs. Fred Mertz.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Ricardo.
Hello, I'd like to sign up for everything, but I'm particularly good at Ping-Pong.
I I really like that game I Well, uh, who will your partner be?
Oh, well, I- at the moment- don't have a partner, but I thought perhaps Well, I'll play with anyone.
Well, I'll do what I can to get a partner for you, Mrs. Ricardo, but right now all I have is couples.
Yes.
Well, I'll, I'll wait outside.
All right.
Oh, Freddie.
Ethel, what's the name of this boat?
The SS Constitution.
Why?
Well, from the way everybody's paired up, I thought maybe it was the SS Noah's Ark.
Oh, honey.
I'll see you outside.
Okay.
Pardon me but do you play Ping-Pong?
Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
Not very well, but I do like the game.
So do I, and I I noticed that they have Well, dear, they're ready for us.
Hello, darling.
Would you excuse me?
Oh, surely.
Come on, Rocky.
That a boy.
Hi, honey.
Oh.
Come on.
Get around there.
Come on.
Sit.
Stay.
Rocky and I had a nice walk.
You play Ping-Pong?
Well, I always knew you were my best friend, but I didn't know you'd be my only one.
You'll never leave me, will you?
You gonna stick with me, pal?
You gonna be  Oh, pardon me, Mrs. Ricardo, but I think I found you a partner.
Oh, really?
Yes.
His name is Kenneth Hamilton.
Kenneth Hamilton.
I'll ask him to come over and see you.
Well, thank you very much.
Hello.
Hello.
You looking for someone?
Yes.
Are you Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes.
Why?
My name is Kenneth Hamilton.
Well, put her there, partner.
Ricky, what are you doing, sitting here in the room with me?
Shouldn't you be somewhere?
No, I still got three minutes before I have to start the dance.
Oh, goodie, goodie, gumdrop!
Three whole minutes just for me.
Never mind.
It says here you played in the shuffleboard contest.
Not only played, we won.
Oh.
Who's Kenneth Hamilton?
Kenny, oh, he's a doll.
He's so cute.
He is?
Yes.
He wanted me to keep the cup that we won, but I said, "Kenny, dear, you keep the cup.
It will remind you always of our " Wait a minute.
wonderful afternoon.
" Wait, wait, wait, wait Wait just a minute.
What do you mean, you said, "Kenny, dear"?
Who is this guy anyway?
Oh, he's just a nice, young man, unmarried, looking for someone to have a little fun with aboard ship.
Look, Lucy, you watch out.
There's a lot of wolves aboard these big ocean liners.
Oh-ho-ho, you're telling me.
What do you mean by that?
Nothing.
Just "oh-ho-ho, you're telling me.
" Well, oh-ho-ho, I'm telling you, you keep away from that guy.
But I promised I'd dance with him tonight.
Well, you're not gonna dance with him tonight.
Oh, well, who will I be dancing with?
You?
Now, you know I'm gonna have to be working.
Well, then I'll just have to dance every dance with Kenny.
You don't have to dance no dances with Kenny.
But I promised him.
I don't care what you promised him!
Huh!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Come in, please.
Is Mrs. Ricardo here?
Oh, yes, right here.
I know you- you're Ricky Ricardo.
I'm pleased to meet you.
My name is Kenneth Hamilton.
Oh, ha, ha, ha!
I am pleased to meet you, Kenny.
My mother says you should keep this.
Thank you, Kenny.
I'll see you tonight.
And don't forget she said she was gonna to dance with you.
I won't.
And as matter of fact, she told me she was gonna dance every dance with you.
Oh, boy!
Everybody!
Ay, ay, ay, ay Ay, ay, ay Canta y no llores Porque cantando se alegren, cielito lindo, los corazones.
Ay, ay, ay, ay Ay, ay, ay Ay, ay, ay, ay Ay, ay, ay Ay, ay, ay, ay.
Aha!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Fred, you're a wonderful dancer.
You're a regular king of the samba.
Arthur Murray, look out.
Whew!
Wasn't that fun?
Yeah.
Thank you, Kenny.
Thank you for the dance.
I have to go now.
It's past my bedtime.
Hi.
Uh-oh, don't tell me.
I never forget a face.
Oh, yes, you're Ricky Ricardo.
Now, cut it out.
You know I have to be working.
You might be understanding.
I might be, yes, but let's face it, I'm a sea-going sorehead.
Say, kitten, how about a little walk out on the deck in the moonlight?
You know what I mean?
Yes, sir.
Will you excuse us?
Gladly.
Let's go, tiger.
He is one, too.
Tiger?
!
They're on their second honeymoon.
Haven't you heard?
Come on, sit down.
The least you can do is talk with me for a while.
Ah, I got a few minutes.
Well, what have you planned for tomorrow?
Well Pardon me, Mr. Ricardo.
Captain Jacobson would like to talk to you.
Okay.
I'm awfully sorry, honey, but I Oh, that's all right.
Go right ahead.
I'm all talked out anyway.
See you later.
Ricky?
Yes, dear.
What time do you finish tonight?
Oh, about 2:30, I guess.
Well, I'm gonna wait for you.
We've gotta have some time together.
Honey, it'll be awfully late.
I don't care.
I'll, I'll wait on the promenade deck.
Okay.
See you later.
Marco, play that song, all right?
Can't a man sit on the stairs with his wife without somebody butting in?
I'm sorry, Fred.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Marco.
Good night.
Oh, hi, honey.
Hi, dear.
Oh, brother, am I beat.
Yeah, I know, but you just forget all about your work now.
This is fun time.
Yep.
Let's dance.
Dance?
Yeah.
There's no music.
Well, I'll hum.
Honey, I'd love to dance with you, but I've been standing on my feet all day long.
Of course you have, dear.
Do you want to take off your shoes?
I'd like to take off my feet.
Oh.
Well, forget all about dancing.
We'll, we'll just stand here and look at that big, yellow, romantic moon, huh?
Gee, isn't it beautiful?
: Uh-huh.
Ricky?
Hmm?
I thought this was going to be our second honeymoon.
It is, honey, it is.
Well, you haven't even kissed me.
Oh, that's right.
Oh, Ricky Excuse me, honey.
Excuse me.
We'll just stand here and look at the moon, huh?
All right.
Lucy, what did you want to see me about?
Is something wrong?
Ethel, you gotta help me.
Oh, no.
You don't even know what it's about.
I know that tone in your voice.
Now, this is important.
Listen, Lucy, I don't mind helping you out on dry land, but this is the high seas.
International law prevails.
It's just a simple, little thing.
Okay.
What is it?
What do you want to do?
Kidnap Ricky.
A simple, little thing?
!
Oh, no, I'm not gonna have anything to do with it.
Ethel, aren't you Ar-Aren't you willing to help me spend just one evening just a few fleeting, golden moments alone with my husband?
Well, as long as you put it that way, I'll do it.
Okay, now, when he comes in at 7:00 and goes in there to change his clothes, I'm going to lock the door and I'm going to give you the key.
Where will I be?
Out on the deck.
I'll hand you the key through the porthole thusly and then you disappear.
Uh what happens when Ricky doesn't show up on the bandstand?
Good thinking.
After I hand you the key, you tell Marco Ricky isn't feeling well and then you disappear.
Uh one more question, Raffles.
Yes?
What about the telephone?
I have disconnected the wires.
Good girl!
Now, hall we synchronize our watches?
Okay.
Psst.
Not yet, Ethel.
You're early.
Well, Tiger's waiting for me on the upper deck, and I don't want to keep him waiting.
Listen, you've waited for 25 years.
You can wait a few more minutes.
Hi.
Hi, dear.
What have you been doing?
Oh, nothing much.
I supposed you want to get dressed and rush right off, so the bathroom is yours, dear.
Thank you.
: Ethel.
Honey, I got a surprise for you.
Oh, you have a surprise for me?
Yes, ma'am.
You and I are going to spend the entire evening together.
I fixed it so I could get the whole night off.
Oh, honey, how wonderful!
Oh, Ricky, that's just great.
Isn't that great?
Dinner first, and then dancing, and then a walk around the deck under the moonlight- you know, the whole romance bit.
Oh, who could ask for a?
Yipe!
What's the matter?
Ethel!
Ethel!
Ethel!
What's the matter?
Oh, Ethel!
Ethel!
Ethel, come back!
Ethel!
Lucy, what's the matter with you?
Ethel!
Ethel!
Lucy, what's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Well, come back in here.
Uh okay.
Ethel.
Oh Come back in here!
I can't.
What do you mean, you can't?
I'm stuck.
Stuck?
I can't get back.
Ricky, get me out of here.
Pull my legs.
I can't get you out.
Pull my legs.
Oh, Ricky, I'm stuck.
Well, wait a minute.
I'll go outside.
The door is locked.
Where's the key?
What?
Where's the key?
I don't believe it.
The door is locked.
Where's the key?
Oh, uh Ethel has it.
Ethel has it?
!
Yeah.
I-I had a surprise for you, too.
You were gonna be my prisoner.
Now, what what made you go and do a thing like that?
Well, I don't know.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
I told you I was gonna get time off.
Yeah, well, I didn't know.
Of all the craziest, silliest things that you have ever done Good evening.
I don't understand it.
Never mind that.
This is no time to argue.
Get me out of here.
Pull my legs.
I tried that; it won't work.
Try it again, for heaven's sakes.
Oh, honey, I don't Good evening.
Good evening.
How are you?
Nice to see you Lucy, what's the matter?
What's the matter?
Oh, Ethel, give him the key.
The key?
What good is the key?
She's stuck.
She's stuck?
What did he try to do to you?
Oh, he didn't try to do anything to me.
I'm just stuck, that's all.
For heaven's sakes, somebody unstick me.
Pull my legs, Ricky!
Pull your legs?
If I only had a few baseballs, I could make a fortune.
Oh, Fred.
What'll we do, honey?
Try to pull me out of here.
Try to pull you out?
Is your arm stuck right there?
Oh, oh, wait a minute, everybody get together!
My love is true, amor tierno I promise you amor eterno So cling to me, dear, and say You'll never let me go Because I love you so, querida mia.
Oh, that was lovely, sweetheart.
Thank you.
We finally got to be alone together, didn't we, dear?
Yes, baby.
Is it cool enough to start again, Mrs. Ricardo?
Yeah, go ahead!
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Oh, Ricky, can you believe it?
We're in London!
How about it, eh?
It just doesn't seem real, actually seeing all those places: Picadilly, London Bridge, Westminster Abbey.
Isn't it exciting?
Oh, and look at this lovely room.
Isn't it nice?
Oh, honey, we have a balcony!
Oh, yeah.
Will that	 Yes.
be all, sir?
Thank you.
Pardon me, but could you tell me where Buckingham Palace is from here?
Yes, ma'am.
It's right over that way.
Oh, Ricky, we can see it from here!
Yeah!
Isn't it beautiful?
Wonderful.
Oh, gee, I-I'm just dying to see the queen.
Oh, have you ever seen the queen?
No, ma'am.
But I came frightful close during the coronation.
I just missed her.
Aw, what a shame.
But I did catch a glimpse of him.
Philip?
No, ma'am.
Danny Kaye.
I'll bring up the rest of your luggage.
All right.
Isn't this wonderful?
Isn't it exciting?
Don't you just love it?
I say, old bean, ain't this the nuts?
What a city this is!
How's your room?
It's great, just like this.
Same view and everything.
Uh, one thing stumped him though.
What was that?
He didn't know how much to tip the bellhop.
I didn't know whether to give him tuppence or thruppence.
Fred, thruppence is only about three cents.
Well, he solved it rather neatly.
What'd he give?
Nuppence.
Well, it's not my fault.
I just can't figure the money over here.
What was your excuse in the USA?
Fred is now the darling of the bellhops on two different continents.
Well, whether I tip him or not, remember that there'll always be an England.
Yeah, but it won't always have us in it.
Come on, we got a million sights to see.
Let's go to Buckingham Palace first and see the queen.
Honey, it's only 10:00.
Queens don't get up this early.
How would you know?
Oh, well, let's just go by the palace and look.
You know, see if the shades are down.
Yeah, and if the milk is in the front porch, don't ring the bell.
Oh, I won't, honey.
Fred, while their majesties are out here hobnobbing with the royalty, let's you and I go to the theater, huh?
Right-o.
Oh, honey, aren't you gonna go with us?
No, I gotta go to the Palladium.
I'll go get my coat.
Okay.
I'll go get my coat, too.
Hey, maybe we can do some shopping.
Okay, I want to get some souvenirs.
Souvenirs!
Okay.
Honey, if I'm gonna go shopping, I need some money.
All right, but no funny stuff now.
What do you mean?
Well, back in Hollywood, you came home with John Wayne's footprints.
I don't want to find Big Ben ticking right next to my bed.
Here.
Thanks What's this?
That's 10, English money.
English money!
Yeah.
How much is this in our money?
Well a pound is $2.80 So that's $28.
Hey, what if I want to buy something less than $28?
You get change, just like you do in America.
Well, I won't know what kind of change I should be getting.
Well, here it is, right in this little book.
Now, you know how much a pound is.
Sure, 16 ounces.
A pound is $2.80.
Oh.
There are 20 shillings in a pound.
Each shilling is worth 14 cents.
There are seven shillings in a dollar and 12 pennies in one shilling, see.
No wonder the Pilgrims left here to go to America.
Just buy whatever you want and trust the people to give you the right change.
All right, honey, I will.
Okay.
I'm ready, honey.
I'm all ready to go shopping.
You all set, Rick?
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
So long, Ricky.
All right.
Bye, Fred.
Don't spend all that dough, I gave you, Ethel.
How much you give her?
$10.
$10?
Well, ten of whatever they call dollars over here.
Fred, if you gave her 10, you gave her $28.
$28!
Holy cow.
Ethel!
Ethel!
Ethel  Come on.
I told you it was too early for the queen.
Well, she gotta come out sometime.
I thought we were gonna go shopping.
Later, later.
No, let's go now.
We can come back here.
No.
We might miss her.
Wouldn't you feel terrible if you went home without seeing the queen?
I'd feel much worse if I went home without spending the money Fred gave me.
Oh.
Look at the book and see if it says what time she comes out.
Oh, okay.
Nope, just tells about the palace, how old it is and how many rooms it has.
Oh, how many rooms has it got?
Over 500!
No wonder she hasn't come out.
She's probably lost.
Oh, look, look!
I see a man.
Where?
Right there.
Do you think that might be Philip?
Oh, I doubt it.
I hardly think Philip would be out wrestling ash cans.
Oh Come on, honey, let's go shopping, huh?
Come on.
Wait a minute.
Pardon me, sir, could you tell me when the queen might be coming out?
Quite clear?
Glad to be of service.
Good morning.
What'd he say?
Couldn't you understand him?
He said: .
What's that?
I don't know.
And after living with Ricky for 15 years, I thought I could understand anybody.
Let's go, honey, huh?
Wait a minute.
Maybe this man will know.
Pardon me, but could you tell me what time the queen might be coming out?
I say, could you tell me what time the queen might be coming out, sir?
Lucy What?
He's not allowed to pay any attention to anyone.
How do you know?
Says it right here in the book.
He's a palace guard.
He's not allowed to pay any attention to anyone.
He's not even allowed to smile.
Why not?
It's tradition and no one can make him break the rule.
I bet I can.
Lucy?
I bet I can make him smile.
Now, Lucy Hello.
He's a big one, isn't he?
Will you pardon me while I pretend not to know who you are?
So you won't smile, huh?
Come on.
Well  Wow, you make Ed Sullivan look like laughing boy.
Did you ever hear the one about the dog psychiatrist that wrote a book?
It's called Is Your Cocker Off His Rocker?
Is Your Collie Off His Trolley?
Is Your Poodle Off His Noodle?
I don't know, that kills them in America.
Oh, Lucy, what a thrill!
What?
Well, didn't you see her?
Who?
The queen.
She just drove out.
No!
No!
I missed her!
Oh, it's all your fault, you sphinx you.
I say, excuse me, I found the answer to your question.
Oh, just a minute now.
What'd you say?
I said, .
You'll have to pardon us.
We're Americans.
We don't understand English.
Could you perhaps talk just a bit slower?
Oh, yes, sorry.
I understand Her Majesty's appearing at 1:00 at the Wimbleshire Hotel Charity Luncheon.
Thank you!
The Wimbleshire Hotel- that's our hotel.
Okay, yeah.
We gotta go right now.
Right now.
Good-bye, Smiley.
Come on, honey, it's almost 1:00.
You want to miss the queen again?
All right, I'm coming.
You wouldn't want me to have a shiny nose when I see the queen, would you?
What's that?
It's a big mob to get somebody's autograph.
Is it the queen?
Oh, they all went inside.
Come on, come on, honey, let's go down.
Oh, I hope we don't miss her again.
Oh, we won't.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Can you see her?
No, I can't see a thing.
Gee, I didn't know queens gave out autographs.
Neither did I. Can I borrow a sheet of your autograph?
Thank you very much.
Would you pass this in there?
I'd like to have an autograph too, please.
Do you see anything?
Nope, not a thing.
Jump way up.
See her now?
No.
Gee, that isn't fair.
They live here.
They've seen her before.
Here it comes.
Oh, thank you very much.
What's the matter?
"Best wishes to one of my British fans.
Signed, Ricky Ricardo.
" Really!
Well, that's just about the sneakiest thing you ever did in your whole life.
What did I do?
All I did was come home.
Yes, you came home at 1:00- the same time the queen was supposed to arrive.
That's the second time today I missed her.
Can I help it if the English people are nice enough to think of me as a celebrity?
Oh		Besides I wish you'd never made a movie.
Really.
I want to tell you something.
Shh Uh, could you tell me, please, what time the queen is arriving for the charity luncheon today?
What?
!
Oh, thank you.
The luncheon was yesterday.
Well, it's not funny and it's all your fault.
My fault?
Yes.
If we'd left New York a day earlier, we'd have been here yesterday, and I'd have seen the queen.
Look, would you just calm down for one minute?
I got something to tell you.
Well, all right, one minute, but hurry up!
I gotta get out and look for the queen.
That's just what I want to talk to you about.
Now, tomorrow night we open our show at the Palladium, right?
Yeah.
All right.
The royal family's gonna be there.
Not only will you get to see the queen, you're gonna be presented to her.
I I I'm gonna be presented to the queen?
Yes.
Oh, Ricky!
What'll I wear?
What'll I do?
What'll I say?
How will I act?
Honey, I'm really gonna be presented to the queen?
Yes.
Lucy, did you hear?
We're gonna meet the queen.
Yes.
I'm so excited, I can't stand it.
Imagine me, meeting a queen face-to-face.
I'm scared.
You're scared- think of the queen.
There's nothing to be scared about.
Gee, I don't know how to address a queen.
What do I say- "Hello, Highness"?
"Good evening, Elizabeth"?
Oh, uh, maybe just call her "Mrs. Mountbatten.
" LUCY.
Oh.
Oh, you make so much of this.
You just walk up, slip her the grip and say, "Hiya, Queen.
" Fred, honestly.
Well, why not?
I've seen her in the newsreel, and she looks like a real good egg.
Oh, Fred!
No, no.
I think you call her "Your Majesty.
" "Your Majesty"?
That's right.
Uh, uh, Your Maj Good evening, Your Majesty.
How do you do?
I don't think you shake hands.
No?
When women are presented to the queen, they curtsey.
They curtsey!
Of course they Oh, dear.
What's the matter?
Well, I can't get into my good dress with my girdle off and I can't curtsey with it on.
Well, you know, I haven't curtsied since I was a kid.
Well, I can remember how.
You put your foot like that and then you bring it around and you make a nice bow Lower, Ethel, lower.
That's as low as I can get.
The queen's gonna have to meet me halfway.
How's this, Ricky?
That's not too bad.
Oh, say, you know, this isn't easy.
It's been years since I used my curtsey muscles.
Hey, we'd better practice.
Yeah, let's practice.
You know, we'll probably have on a big dress, too, you know, a big wide skirt.
We ought to really practice a sweeping one.
It'll make it more graceful, you know.
Let's see now.
My dress would come out to about there.
Ooh!
Down, girl, down.
Just a minute now, I'll make it.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Rome wasn't built like you either.
You mind your own business!
Yeah, you and Ricky practice your bowing.
Yeah, practice bowing.
All right.
Now, let's see.
There, that feels good.
I say, you Americans do have strange customs, don't you?
We were just practicing bowing.
Yes, we're gonna be presented to the queen.
Are you now?
Ain't that nice?
Uh, good evening, Your Majesty.
Oh, blimey, that'll never do.
Huh, what's the matter with it?
Well, ma'am, according to British etiquette, when you're presented to the queen, your curtsey is all the way down, resting the weight on the heel, extending the end and bowing the head like this.
All the way down.
Oh, that's pretty, yeah.
All the way down.
All the This leg is over here.
All the way down.
On the heel.
Then extend the hand and bowing the head.
Boy, I'd like to have the lineament concession for this group.
It's simple once you get the hang of it.
Well, thanks very much for showing us.
Oh, ma'am, one thing you got to watch out for.
What?
The hind leg.
The hind leg?
The one you puts behind you.
Keep it firm so's you don't topple over.
Oh.
I wish she hadn't mentioned that.
Try it, honey.
Topple over?
Keep the hind leg firm.
Yeah.
Firm and sit on your heel.
That's it, that's it!
And, uh Yes, and keep your Whoops-a-daisy.
Aw, you'll get it, ma'am.
All you need's a bit of practice.
Good luck to you.
Thank you.
: Ooh, I say, governor, I think I've hurt my hip.
Well, come on.
Enough of this.
Let's go and have lunch, eh?
Now you're talk No, I'm gonna stay right here and practice my curtseying.
How about you, Ethel?
Well, I think I'll go with the fellows, Lucy.
I don't like to curtsey on an empty stomach.
Yeah.
After we have lunch, we'd better go to International Artists and talk to the fellow over there.
Good idea, Rick.
See you later, honey.
Good-bye Oh.
Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye, governor.
See you later.
Ooh.
Oh, hi, honey.
Hi.
You're still rehearsing?
Yes, sir, I'm right in the groove.
Well, I think you'd better ungroove yourself.
Why, what do you mean?
I hate to tell you this but I found out something this afternoon.
What?
Well, the royal family has a special room behind their box at the theater.
They do?
And it seems that only certain people get invited up there to be presented to the queen.
Oh, dear, what a shame.
The Mertzes don't get to go.
Well, they'll just have to keep a stiff upper lip.
Lucy Hmm?
Make it three stiff upper lips.
What do you mean?
Well, honey, I looked at the invitation and it only says Ricky Ricardo.
But surely they mean Ricky Ricardo and wife or Ricky Ricardo and guest.
I'll be a guest.
Honey, no, it only says Ricky Ricardo.
I'm sorry, honey, but I don't know what to do.
Well, couldn't you call Buckingham Palace and ask if you could bring a friend?
I don't think it'll be right to question the queen's list.
Besides, you know, the British people think that Americans are a little forward anyway, and I'm kind of representing the American people.
: Oh, Ricky, I did so want to meet the queen.
Give me the International Artists Agency, please.
Uh, Philip Wilcox.
Hello, Philip, this is Ricky Ricardo.
Yes, fine, thank you.
Listen, uh, I got a problem here.
I'd like to ask your advice.
Do you think it'll be all right if I bring my wife tomorrow night when I'm presented to the queen?
No, her name is not on the list.
I know, Philip, but she's dying to meet your queen.
What was that, Philip?
Ricky, I didn't mean for you to really call Buckingham Palace.
Oh, I see.
Well, thanks a lot, Phil.
Phil!
I'll I'll see you tomorrow night.
Good-bye.
What's the matter with you?
Well, talk about Americans being forward!
And where did you ever get the telephone number of Buckingham Palace?
Buckingham Oh, oh.
Is that what you thought?
No, I was calling Philip Wilcox.
That's my agent here in Europe.
Oh.
I just wanted to find out if he thought it'd be all right to bring you tomorrow.
What'd he say?
He said no.
Your name is not on the list, it's not proper.
Oh, dear.
He said it'd be different if if you were in the show, you know.
If you were one of the entertainers or something, maybe he could Ricky, Ricky, I've asked you to let me in that show before, but I never meant it as much as I do this time.
If you don't let me be in your show at the Palladium, I'm gonna give you such a punch, you'll talk funnier than you do now!
All right, all right.
I know this is very important to you.
You can be It is.
in the show.
Oh, thank you, honey, thank you!
Oh, baby, if you weren't already married, I'd marry you.
Now what can I do?
Well, now, let me see, uh How about that Could you dance the lead in that, uh train horse number?
Dance the lead?
Yeah.
Train horse number?
Yeah, yeah.
The ponies.
The circus pony number.
Where I play the ringmaster.
Yes, yes, I could.
Sure, I could.
You haven't rehearsed it or Well, I've seen it, I've seen it so many times, honey, I You sure you know all the steps?
Yes, yes, I know all the steps.
How about that They have to prance out.
Yeah, how about that big leap they make through the loop and all that stuff?
I'd leap through fire and water to see the queen.
Yes, and I know how they prance out That's right and I got the whip and the whistle.
Ooh!
Ooh!
What's the matter?
Ooh, I got a little cramp in my leg.
I guess my muscles are tired from all that bowing.
Well, are you sure you gonna be all right tomorrow?
Oh, certainly I'll be all right tomorrow for heaven's sake.
A little charley horse- that ought to be good for a pony number.
Ah-ha-ha!
Oh                                   Ray, tell the chief electrician to put a new lamp in that blue border.
Fred, has Ricky come back from seeing the queen?
No.
How's Lucy?
Oh, she hasn't been able to get the charley horse out of her leg yet.
I never thought I'd see the day when Lucy'd turn down an introduction to the queen.
Well, she's so embarrassed.
She thinks she made a fool of herself in that number and she can't curtsey.
And she won't meet the queen if she can't curtsey.
Hi!
Oh, did you, did you meet the queen?
What was she like?
Oh, Ethel, she is the most charming and gracious lady I have ever met.
Oh, I knew she would be.
What about the duke?
Is he a pretty good joe?
Just as charming as she was.
Listen, how's Lucy?
Oh, she feels terrible.
She's so disappointed.
Well, wait till she hears what I gotta tell her.
What?
Well, the queen has requested to meet the lady that did the comical dancing.
I'm going to tell her right now.
Hey!
This is like a command performance.
Oh, this is gonna break her heart, Fred.
The poor little thing.
Of all times to get a charley horse.
I bet she goes.
Oh, never.
Well, this means a lot to her.
Besides, it's a special invitation.
But she can't curtsey.
I can tell Going?
Well, you won't believe this.
She got into a curtsey position to see if she could do it and she can't get out of it.
Oh, well, that's that.
Oh, no, that's not.
Wait till you see.
She got a couple of ushers and well See for yourself.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Boy, these English people are sure friendly.
What a party!
Well, I'm glad you had a good time.
Didn't you?
If you ask me, the English people are a little too friendly.
Especially that drooling debutante you danced with all night.
All night?
How many times did I dance with her?
I'm sure I didn't count.
Three times.
Five.
Three times.
You danced with her three times.
You intermissioned her twice.
Now, honey, it's very flattering of you to be jealous but I didn't ask her, she asked me.
Can't you say no?
Of course not.
It's not polite.
Don't forget, we're guests here in London.
You'd better learn how to be rude before we get to Paris.
Now, honey, that girl is just a fan.
She saw my last performance at the Palladium.
I have to be nice to my public.
Oh, sure- your pretty, young public.
You weren't being very nice to all of those ugly, old public sitting around.
Angela Randall is just a nice, stagestruck girl.
Aha!
"Aha" what?
You know her name.
Of course I know her name.
Yeah, well ha-ha!
What's wrong with asking her name?
The first time you danced with me, you asked me my name, and look what happened.
Well, everybody makes a mistake once in a while.
What?
!
Honey, I danced with the girl three times.
I'll probably never see her again.
You don't have to start an international "instant.
" I'll start over whatever I want  with an international incident.
Oh, look, you woke up I can do what I want about it.
You woke up everybody in the hotel.
I don't care who I woke up!
Ay-ay-ay.
Hello.
Yeah, speaking.
Who?
Oh.
Oh, yes.
Yes, sir, I have certainly heard of you, sir.
Well, I'd be delighted to.
Tomorrow morning?
Wonderful.
Good-bye.
Who was that?
That was Sir Clive Richardson.
The Sir Clive Richardson?
Yeah.
He wants to talk to me about a picture deal.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
You know, there's a whole layout of him on the London Times today.
Really?
Look.
On his country estate.
It's called Berkshire Manor.
See, that's Sir Clive right there on his horse.
Oh, yeah.
"Sir Clive Richardson, well-known cinema producer, is pictured above, just after riding to hounds.
" "Riding to hounds"?
What's that?
Oh, honestly, Ricky.
Don't they do anything in Cuba?
That's what they call fox hunting.
Oh, oh.
Oh, gee, what I wouldn't give if Sir Clive would invite us to his country estate for the weekend.
Ricky, you've just got to get us an invitation.
I don't gotta do nothing; I haven't even met the man.
Oh, but it'll be so easy.
He'll be right here.
All you have to do is ask him.
Oh, honey, don't be ridiculous.
I couldn't do a thing like that.
Well, I could.
Lucy, you don't want to be a moocher, do you?
Just call me "Minnie.
" Now, look, I forbid you to ask him.
Oh, I won't come right out and ask him.
I'll just hint around, you know.
Nothing doing.
Just forget it.
But, honey, it's such a big estate.
we were there.
Now, Lucy, American tourists have a reputation for being pushy and I don't want to add to that reputation.
Oh Now, listen, promise me.
No hinting, no word, no nothing.
Oh Promise?
All right, I'll promise!
Don't be so pushy.
Is the coast clear?
Yeah.
Ricky's getting dressed.
He's been trying to get rid of me all morning.
I'll bet.
Did you get it?
I did.
The right size?
I know your size.
Now, you know the plan.
Yes.
We telephone you at exactly 11:30.
Right.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk What's the matter with you?
How come we always get sucked into Lucy's wild schemes?
Because we're a couple of shnooks, that's why.
Okay, I just wanted to know.
Lucy.
Yeah?
Uh, honey, do you think you could get us invited for the weekend, too?
No.
Now, Ethel, I can only wangle for two.
Well, as long as you're wangling for two, it No, now, honey, two is just right.
Four would be overwangling.
Shh.
Oh, hi, Rick.
Hi, Rick.
Hi.
Uh, we just, uh, dropped in to say good-bye.
We're going someplace.
Good.
I was expecting a guest.
Why don't you take Lucy with you?
Oh, I've already been there.
Why don't you go again, dear?
Well, I didn't like it the first time.
What didn't you like the first time?
Wherever they're going.
She didn't like it.
No, I didn't.
No, she didn't.
Well, good-bye, Rick.
We'll see you later.
So long, Rick.
We'll talk to you later.
Okay.
Come on.
Bye.
Come on, Fred.
Bye.
Lucy, uh why don't you go shopping or-or, you know, go sightseeing, take a bus ride.
Right here, spend some money- go ahead.
You wouldn't by any chance be trying to get rid of me, would you?
Who, me?
Why, honey, how can you say such a thing?
It's just that Sir Clive is coming over, and there'll be a lot of boring talk, you know.
Yeah, well, I happen to be very fond of boring talk.
It's one of my hobbies.
I took it in high school- "Boring Talk 1A".
Yes?
Sir Clive?
Oh, ask him to come up, please.
Thank you.
Lucy Hmm?
remember your promise.
No hinting about a weekend invitation.
I won't say a word.
Mr. Ricardo?
Sir Clive!
How are you, sir?
How do you do?
I'm very glad to see you.
May I help you with your coat?
Thanks very much.
Yes, sir.
Come right in, please.
Oh.
Oh, Sir Clive, this is my wife, Lucy.
Delighted.
Oh, it is in-indeed an honor to meet you, Sir Clive, sir.
Oh, no trouble, no trouble.
Will you be seated?
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Uh, Sir Clive, you know, I want to tell you something.
Last night when you called me after you revealed your identity, I was completely flabbergasted.
You could have knocked me over with a feather.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, uh, oh, Ricky said last night when you called and revealed your identity, he was completely flabbergasted.
You-you could have knocked him over with a feather.
He was that surprised.
Oh, oh, quite, yes.
Yes, uh, yes, I-I must explain that call.
My daughter's idea, you know.
She's quite a fan of yours.
She thinks that you would be absolutely smashing in the British cinema.
Oh.
Yeah, well Oh.
Oh, Sir Clive said that he wanted to explain about the call.
It was his daughter's idea.
She's a fan of yours, and she thinks you'd be a big hit in British movies.
Oh!
He says, "Oh"!
Oh.
He says, "Oh.
" Well, if you'll excuse me, I know you both have scads of things to talk about.
So, uh, I'll see you a little later, perhaps.
Yes, very good, yes.
Uh, Mr. Ricardo, uh, my daughter tells me that you've just recently finished a cinema in America.
A cinnamon in America?
Yes.
She said you've just completed one.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!
I- I-I just completed a cinnamon in America.
I beg your pardon?
What you just said, I did it.
Oh!
The cinema, the cinema!
Yes.
Yes.
so that after we finish this European tour, I don't have any other engagements.
Splendid, splendid.
Say, I must be doing better.
I must be talking a lot better.
You understood the last two things I said.
I say!
What?
You know, I must be improving, too.
You understood me.
: Yes, yes.
Well, you know, just give us a little time.
We'll get along fine.
Well, I'm sure we will.
Yes, indeed.
Tallyho.
Lucy, what's that?
What's what?
That.
Oh, oh, this is my new outfit for the weekend.
Charming.
Thank you, Sir Clive.
But we are not going anyplace for the weekend.
Oh, didn't I tell you?
Tell me what?
Well, you know, my fondest dream has always been to spend a weekend on one of those fabulous English country estates.
My dream has finally come true.
The earl has invited us.
The earl?
What earl?
Didn't I tell you?
It seems to be a lot of things that you didn't tell me.
Well, Fred and Ethel- they're our friends, the Mertzes- uh, met this earl in the lobby.
The Mertzes met an earl in the lobby?
Yes.
And one thing led to another, before they knew it, the earl had invited us to his country estate for a ripping weekend of riding and shooting just like we do at home.
Oh, I say, which earl is it?
I mean, what's the chap's name?
How was that again?
He wants to know the earl's name.
I heard him.
Well, what is his name?
Uh You know, I know most of the fellows down there.
Uh, Earl of, uh, Gloucester?
Mm Earl of, uh, Twickenham?
I know- Earl of Chichester.
No, uh No, I think it's the, uh, Earl of Wilson.
Earl of Wilson?
Yes, he's a new one.
He's just been promoted from assistant earl.
Oh, well, very well.
The country down there simply crawling with earls, isn't it?
Yes, isn't it?
Uh, by the way, evidently, you must be quite a horsewoman, Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh oh, quite.
Oh, what a shame.
If I'd only known, you could have come down to my place for the weekend.
Oh, well, that's very sweet of you, Sir Clive, but thanks just the same.
Oh  I'll get it.
I'll get it, dear.
I'll get it.
Hello.
What's that?
Oh, you don't say.
Oh oh, well, give him my best.
Another time?
Well, I'm afraid that would be impossible.
You see, we're leaving the country.
It's quite all right.
Good-bye.
Drat the luck!
Trouble?
The earl's got the gout and had to cancel our weekend invitation.
My dream bubble has burst.
Well, now, perhaps not.
What do you mean, Sir Clive?
Now, you're, you're perfectly free to come to my place for the weekend.
No, no, Sir Clive.
Oh, no, no.
We wouldn't think of barging in, my goodness.
Not at all, I insist.
And, and bring your friends, too.
Four strangers dropping in on you for the weekend?
A glorious weekend where I would have the most memorable experience of my life?
I wouldn't hear of it.
Oh, no trouble at all.
No trouble.
No, no, it's just, uh, too pushy.
Oh, well, of course, if you feel like that I mean, I But if you insist.
Good show.
We'll have the most ripping weekend.
Oh, right-o!
And, by the way, we can talk business down there, too, you know.
Well, yes, sir, yes, that would be fine.
Thank you.
I'll get it, dear.
Hello.
Yes, Sir Clive is here.
Oh, by all means, send her up.
Your daughter is here.
Oh, yes, yes, I asked her to pick me up here.
We are lunching together.
Oh.
Oh, well, if you'll excuse me, then, I'll be right back.
Charming woman, your wife.
Charming.
Uh, Sir Clive, I'm very anxious, uh, to meet your daughter.
You said she's a fan of mine?
But you have already met her.
You danced with her last night.
I did?
Richardson?
No, no.
Angela doesn't use her family name.
Um, she's an actress, you know.
Uses a stage name: Randall.
Your daughter is Angela Randall?
Rather!
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!
I beg your pardon?
Oh, oh, uh, uh, that's an American expression.
It means "blimey.
" Oh!
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay- blimey.
She must be here.
Hello, Angela.
Hello, Ricky.
I'm glad to see you.
Hello, Father.
My dear.
Hello.
I believe we met last night.
Uh she's your daughter?
Yes.
Angela Randall is her stage name.
I just found out.
Isn't that funny?
Hilarious.
Father, did you have your little business talk with Ricky?
Well, only partly.
Yeah, we didn't get quite finished, but it's all right because your father has asked us over to your place for the weekend.
Uh, yes, but unfortunately, we will not be able to accept.
Oh, but you accepted just now, you know.
Uh, yes, but dash it all, I just remembered, we're scheduled to go to the cricket matches this weekend.
At this time of year?
Cricket's out of season.
Well, these are young crickets.
Don't worry, Sir Clive, we'll be there.
Oh, marvelous, Ricky.
It'll be such fun!
It'll be just ripping!
Come along, Father.
Yes, thank you.
Good-bye.
It'll be such fun to have you down with us.
Well, I'd love to.
May I help you with your hat, sir?
No, thank you.
I'll just carry it.
Well, I'll be seeing you all Saturday.
Cheerio.
Good-bye.
Cheerio.
"Cheerio.
" Ricky, we are not going!
Oh, yes, we're going.
I wouldn't want to burst your dream bubble.
My dream did not include a washed-out blond named Angela Randall.
You knew she was Sir Clive's daughter all along.
I did not know any such thing.
You did, too!
I didn't know anything.
But you accepted, and we're going.
You opened your big mouth and you put your foot in it.
Tallyho!
Tallyho!
You're invited, you're invited.
Ethel, have you seen Ricky anywhere?
Yeah, I think he's out with Angela someplace.
I know that, but where are they this time?
I think she's showing him the rock garden.
Yesterday it was the rose garden.
This morning it was the stable, then the grape arbor.
What's she doing, auditioning him for caretaker?
Oh, honey, you're making too much out of this.
Well, how long does it take to look at a rock garden?
What are they doing, prospecting for uranium?
Lucy, you're being silly about this.
Listen, if she was monopolizing Fred, and you never got to see him, what would you say?
I'd say, "Jolly good show, Angela, old bean.
Have at it.
" You would not.
I'll tell you one thing.
I'm not letting them out of my sight again.
Oh, Lucy.
Oh, there you are, Lucy.
We looked all over for you.
We wanted you to see the rock garden with us.
Sure you did.
Hi, honey.
Hello, stranger.
I didn't realize it, but I guess I've been monopolizing Ricky ever since he got here.
What must you think?
Would you really like to know, huh?
Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, it must be time for tea.
I'm just famished!
Uh, where are Sir Clive and Fred?
Oh, they're down by the stable.
Well, now, let's all go down there and get them, huh?
Ricky, be a dear and show her the way.
I've been wanting to chat with Lucy.
All right.
Lucy, dear Yes, Angela?
My dearest friend, Cecily Higgins, is having a lawn party tomorrow, and I was wondering, might I borrow Ricky?
Well, yes, you might borrow him if I could go along as collateral.
Oh.
Well, that's kind of embarrassing.
You see, Father's car is in the shop and all we have is my little sports runabout, and it only seats two.
Oh.
Well, maybe you could strap me on the fender like a deer.
Oh, now, Lucy, you aren't going to get into a stew, are you?
You could feed the whole British Army on the stew I'm going to get into.
But I promised Cecily I'd be there.
She's always managing to get celebrities at her country estate, and I just want to take Ricky down there to show him off.
He's a prize.
Yes, well, that prize belongs in my box of Cracker Jacks.
Oh, dear!
Well, come on.
Here they are.
I found them down at the stable.
Angela, my dear, I've had a perfectly topping idea.
In honor of our American guests, I've arranged for a fox hunt tomorrow.
Oh, wonderful, Father!
How about it, Ricky?
Fine, I'd love to.
Will you join us, Lucy?
You just know I will.
Splendid!
But, of course, you won't be able to go, Angela.
You promised to go to Cecily's party tomorrow.
Oh, silly me.
Cecily's party is the day after tomorrow.
Oh.
I can go to the fox hunt.
Oh, splendid!
Then that's all settled.
Now, how about a spot of tea?
Yes, let's all go have some tea.
I'll enjoy that.
You run along and have some, Fred.
All right.
Lucy, why did you say you'd go on a fox hunt?
You've never been on a horse in your life.
Well, I don't care.
I'm not letting them out of my sight.
The fox isn't the only thing she's hunting.
Bye.
Good-bye.
Hurry up, Lucy!
Bring back the bacon, Rick.
Okay.
Good-bye!
Good luck!
Psst!
What?
Lucy, what's the matter with you?
I'm scared.
Well, I should think you would be if you've never been on a horse before.
Shh!
I don't want the horse to hear that.
Lucy, this is dangerous.
Not half as dangerous as leaving Ricky and Angela alone all afternoon.
Does Ricky know you've never been on a horse before?
No.
I told him I rode a lot in Girl Scout camp.
You needn't be afraid, ma'am.
Well, Danny Boy is the gentlest horse in the stable.
He looks kind of ferocious to me.
Ah, gentle as a lamb, ma'am.
Well, uh, haven't you got, maybe, a smaller horse?
No, ma'am.
Have you got a large lamb?
You'd better get started, ma'am.
Yeah, well, h-h-how do you get on this animal?
Well, just come right around this side.
Oh.
Now, then, put your left foot up in the stirrup.
That's the stirrup.
Left foot?
Yeah.
Okay.
There she goes.
There you go.
Up!
Oh!
Again, honey.
Fred, you help her.
All right.
Fred will help you.
He'll help you now.
Now, wait a minute.
Let's get all together, huh, fellas?
I'll, I'll, I'll count.
One, two, three.
Oh!
Fred, I want to stay up on top.
I don't want to go all the way over.
I was only trying to help you.
Well, you-you just don't know your own strength.
Come on.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'll I'll be able to make it.
Shall we try this slippery beast again?
There we are.
Up you go.
I have to give a big push.
I'd like to oblige, ma'am, but I'm a rotten jumper.
I'm sorry.
Come on, now, honey.
You'll make it this time.
Shall we have another go at it?
Here she goes, here she goes.
Up she goes!
Good girl!
Just sit up, ma'am.
Yeah, well, you ride your way, I'll ride mine.
They're going, honey.
They're going.
Hang on now!
Hang on, Lucy!
Hang on!
Hang on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Oh, Fred, I'm worried about her.
She didn't exactly look like Johnny Longden sitting up there.
You look at her.
I can't stand to look.
They're off and running.
: Oh!
Oh!
Lucy!
How do you steer this thing?
You steer him with the reins, ma'am.
You pull on the left rein to go left and on the right rein to go right.
Yeah, well, where are the brakes?
You just pull back on the reins, ma'am, like that.
Lucy, if you didn't know how to steer, how did you get back here?
I don't know.
Oh, Danny Boy always comes back to the stable if you let him have his head, ma'am.
It comes straight in the backway every time.
I gotta go!
Oh, you gotta go.
Hang on now!
Okay.
Hang on, Lucy!
Hang on!
Hang on!
Hang on tight!
How's she doing, Fred?
Well, I can't find her.
You can't find her?
I can't find her.
She's disappeared!
She's disappeared?
Is there a horse without a rider?
No!
Is there a rider without a horse?
No!
Oh, let me look, Fred!
Well, don't tear my head off.
All right, but just let me look.
I can't stand it.
Oh, where could she be?
I don't know.
She How did you ever do that?
Well, believe me, it wasn't easy.
We went over a jump, and while I was up in the air, Danny Boy must have turned around.
Oh, honey, please give this up.
No, sir, Danny Boy and I are going to see this thing through together.
Well, you'll do better this time.
Hang on now!
You'll do better!
Hold on now!
Hold on now!
SIR  The beast got away.
I can't understand what happened to that fox.
Neither can I. He must have run to ground.
That's all.
Hi.
Hi.
Isn't Lucy with you?
No.
What's the matter?
Well, she didn't come back, but her horse come back quite some time ago.
Yeah, and he was all covered with brambles.
The groom's out looking for her now.
Well, let's go get a horse and look for her.
Now wait a minute, that might not be necessary.
Look!
Lucy, are you in there?
Yeah.
I don't know what you see in this fox hunting.
Get me out of here.
How did you get in there?
I don't know, but get me out.
But how?
There's, there's There are some clippers inside here.
Good.
It's kind of spooky in here.
I have a feeling I'm not alone.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Oh, honey, what a show!
That scene where the girl sacrificed herself to save the whole village- well, it was just wonderful.
Isn't that great?
Yeah, and weren't those Scotch costumes colorful?
The men in the kilts and the bagpipes and the sword dance!
Oh, gee, I enjoyed it.
Yeah, I did, too.
Ricky, I've got an idea!
No!
You don't even know what it is.
Oh, yes, I do.
You want to go to Scotland and look up your mother's relatives.
You think you're so smart.
That wasn't it at all.
That was the farthest thing from my mind.
All right, what was your idea?
Well, why can't we go to Scotland?
I promised Mother that, that I'd look up some of the McGillicuddy clan.
Maybe bring back a bolt of the family plaid, you know.
Just forget it.
Oh, why, honey?
No.
Scotland isn't very far.
Come in!
It wouldn't take very long to go to Scotland.
Hi, honey!
Oh, hi, hi!
We waited up to see how you like the show.
Oh, I just loved it!
What is that?
Well, it's a dragon.
I bought it to take home for little Ricky.
I thought it was something different.
Well, it's different all right.
Well, I have never seen anything like this before.
Really?
Well, when I was a kid, they had toy dragons.
When you were a kid, they had real dragons.
Well, it certainly is a ferocious-looking beast.
Do you think it'll scare little Ricky?
Oh, no, he'll love it.
Ethel, how would you like to go to Scotland?
Scotland!
Yeah.
Yeah, she wants to go to Scotland to look for some of her mother's relatives.
Look, honey, Scotland is a big place.
You can't just get off the train and walk up to someone and say, "Take me to the nearest McGillicuddy.
" I know just where to look.
My great-great-great-grandfather was Angus McGillicuddy.
He lived in the wee town of Kildoonan in Northern Scotland.
It's between Golspie and Ullapool.
Oh, you must have made that up.
I did not.
Now, look, all I want to do is send a wire up there and see if any of our relatives are still around.
All right.
I'd like to hear you explain to the operator about Gillhooly between Galespie and Babalu and the Cranafranz.
Aa-ah!
Hello, uh, I'd like to send a telegram, please.
Good night, honey.
Good night, baby.
Angus McGillicuddy.
What's so funny about Angus McGillicuddy?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
It's a very ordinary, everyday name.
I know a hundred of them.
You should talk.
I'll bet your great-great-great- grandfather's name was probably Enchilada Ricardo.
All right, good night.
'Night.
Oh, you take the high road And I'll take the low road  Lucy, turn off those bagpipes!
Now go to sleep.
Aye, laddie!
Good night.
Hoot mon!
Calm yourselves, my friends, calm yourselves!

RICKY : A McGillicuddy is here.
A McGillicuddy is here.
Are you a McGillicuddy?
That's right.
My name is Lucy.
I'm sorry, Miss Lucy.
I kinna let you pass.
Why not?
I'm your bodyguard.
I'm Scotty MacTavish MacDougall MacArdo.
You're Scotch?
Aye.
My great-great- great-grandfather sailed to Scotland with the Spanish Armada.
Perhaps you've heard of him- Enchilada Ricardo.
Why are you lookin' at me like that, Scotty MacTavish MacDougall MacArdo?
Lucy, you gaha maha pihee face.
"I gaha "maha pihee face"?
I believe I'm in love with ye.
With me?
Aye.
Little old heather-pickin' me?
It was love at firrrst sight.
But woe is me!
What's the matter?
You're in grave danger.
Why?
They're going to throw a McGillicuddy to the dragon tomorrow.
They're going to throw me to a dragon?
Aye.
Every 30 years, they throw a McGillicuddy to the two terrible two-headed dragon for his dinner.
No wonder I'm the last of the McGillicuddys!
I'm in love with the dragon's dinner The dragon's embraceable dinner I'll swear my love will e'er be true I'll serve ye with all me heart But the hungry dragon will serve ye, too He'll serve ye a la carte He'll serve me a la carte?
He'll serve ye a la carte I'm in love with the dragon's dinner And the dragon's a drag on me!
I'm in love with the dragon's dinner The dragon's embraceable dinner My bonnie chick, you'll always be You'll fill my every need But woe is me I hate to see my chicken fricasseed "Your chicken fricasseed"?
My chicken fricasseed You're the stew in the dragon's dinner And the dragon's a drag on me Maybe a nip of heather mist would put ye in the mood?
Well, that would be a novel twist even the stew would be stewed.
But when that dragon starts to eat, I'll really get his goat.
I'll kick and I'll scratch and I'll drag my feet all the way down his throat!
I'm in love with the dragon's dinner The dragon's embraceable dinner Our weddin' day we ne'er will see Or our kids that might have been Kith and kin we ne'er will be So kith me while you kin!
So kiss me while you kin!
And kiss me once again I'm in love, I'm in love I'm in love with the dragon's dinner And the dragon's a drag on me!
Why does it always have to be a McGillicuddy the dragon eats?
Oh, that's life, lassie.
It's nature's way.
Cats eat mice, dogs eat bones, cows eat grass, and dragons eat McGillicuddys.
Well, let's you and I go and have a talk with this terrible two-headed dragon.
Maybe it'll listen to reason.
Well, wha' ha' we got to lose?
Let's go.
I wish you'd get over that cold.
It's driving me crazy!
Aah!
Gee, I haven't eaten in 30 years.
Boy, am I starved!
Me, too!
Mmm Won't it be good to sink our teeth into a nice, fresh McGillicuddy?
Aye, yummy, yummy, yum!
How will we have it this time?
How about a McGillicuddy burger?
Nah, no.
Well, what about McGillicuddy foo yong?
Oh, no!
Why not?
Well, we only eat once every 30 years.
You know how that Chinese food is- you eat it and a year later, you're hungry.
Well, I still want a McGillicuddy foo yong.
Well, I don't!
Well, I do!
Well, I don't!
I do!
Oh, who ever said two heads are better than one?
Aah  Two heads are nae better than one, than one They're not even better than none, than none So pity a two-headed dragon Two heads are nae better than one Hoot mon!
Hoot mon!
Whenever I come to a fork in the road My heads have a terrible fight My right head wants to go to the left And my left wants to go to the right!
I want to go this way!
I want to go that!
You see, we could never agree.
Oh, I wish we had another head to be the referee!
Hoot mon!
Hoot mon!
However, there's one good reason for an extra head to keep.
When I'm too tired to stay awake, I sing myself to sleep.
Sleep gently, sweet dragon Just close your wee eyes And dream of a dinner Of fresh people pie The dragon is dreaming In slumber so deep Now get up!
Why did you wake me up?
Because I want to sleep and you I don't want you sleeping.
I want to sleep.

What are you whistling at?
Get a load of those drumsticks!
I kinna let you go, Lucy.
I will fight the dragon with my bare hands.
You'll fight the dragon for me?

But the moment of them all, the moment I'll recall, the blissest of the bliss is this.
For today you will slay me a dragon, my darling, my hero, I'm thrilled.
Ah.

But for 32 bars, let's sing and act merrily.
Life is ours Temporarily.
It's time for romance, so darling let's dance The dragon waltz Your life is nill till you know the thrill Of the dragon waltz.

Didn't you, Scotty?
Well What do you mean, "well"?
You just said for bonnie Annie Lucy, you would lay you down and die.
I said no such thing.
I said I'd lay me doon and dee.

{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Oh, Ricky, Paris- isn't it wonderful?
You happy?
I haven't a worry in the world.
That's good.
Mademoiselle from marmatish She hasn't been kissed in 40 years Inky dinky parlez vous, dum-dum.
Quite a village, eh, Rick?
Isn't it great, Fred?
Lucy, I'm so excited, I don't think I can stand it.
Oh What a town.
Hasn't changed a bit.
Everything is exactly the same as it was in 1918.
Present company excepted.
Yeah.
Listen, Fred, I have to see my French agent today, so you can take the day off.
A day off in Paris?
Hot ziggedy!
You are coming on a sightseeing tour with Lucy and me.
Cold ziggedy.
No, Ethel, you and Fred take that tour.
What are you going to do?
Oh, I kind of want to get off by myself- you know, feel the pulse of the city, get the true flavor of Paris.
Well, you can't go running around Paris all by yourself.
Why not?
What about your French?
What about my French?
Well, Paris is a big city, and not knowing the language, you're liable to get into a lot of trouble.
Oh, poo.
When you first came to the United States, you didn't get into a lot of trouble because you didn't know the language, did you?
I'm married, aren't I?
What?
She told me that "I do" meant "Pleased to meet you.
" And then she introduced me to the preacher.
Just a minute, just a minute.
What are you doing?
I'm looking up the French for While you're at it, look up "I am lost.
Take me to the Royal Hotel.
" Oh, now, honey, what can happen?
How can I get lost?
I have my French dictionary, I have my guidebook, I have my map of Paris.
Don't try to fight it, Rick.
Just call the American Embassy and tell them to stand by.
All right, but be careful, honey, eh?
I will.
Don't worry about me.
Just give me some money.
All right.
I think I'll just wander around, and who knows?
I may discover an undiscovered artist whose paintings have never been discovered.
Sure, sure, you do that, yeah.
Well, now, that's possible.
I read about a man who bought a painting for $2.98, and ten years later, it was worth $50,000.
Well!
well, get me two dozen.
Here.
Here's 20 bucks.
Take this to the American Express office and they'll give you 7,000 francs.
I like this better than English money.
It's the same in dollars.
Oh, I know, but it sounds like more.
Okay.
Be careful now.
I will.
Have a good time on your sightseeing tour.
So long, Rick.
See you later, honey.
Bye.
See you later.
We'll go down to the Express office with you, Lucy.
I want to change some money and pick up the mail.
Okay.
Well, Fred, I can't go looking like this.
Why not?
Well, look at my hair.
What's the matter?
It looks all right to me.
It's up in curlers!
Isn't that the way you always wear it?
No, that's not the way I always wear it!
We'll see you down at the Express office later, honey.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
It is pretty.
It is pretty.
Pardon.
C'est joli.
Le painting c'est joli.
Oh, thank you very much.
Oh, uh, you speak English.
A little.

Are you famous?
Not yet.
Don't go away.
I'll be right back.
Psst.
Psst.
Who, me?
Madame is uh Madame is going in there to exchange American currency, n'est-ce pas?
Oui.
Ah, ha.
There is no need for madame to go all that way in there.
I can do it for you right here.
Oh?
And, besides, in there, they give you only 350 francs for a dollar.
I can give you 450.
Well  gee, it's lucky I met you.
Ah, Oui.
I see madame has there a 20 dollar.
Yes.
I can give you, uh Oh, well, uh, just a second.
How come you can give me more than the American Express can?
Ah.
Well, madame, it is very simple.
You see there this big building?
Yeah.
They pay high rent.
I work out of doors, hmm?
As you Americans say, no overhead.
Oh oh, well, that makes sense.
Okay.
Oh, merci.
Merci, madame.
Au revoir.
Oh, uh, I have some friends meeting me here, and I'm quite sure they'd like to exchange their money, too.
Ah, bon, madame, bon.
Bon?
Bon.
Bon.
Oh, bon!
C'est tres bon.
Ah!
Evidemment, madame parle et comprend beaucoup de francais.
Huh?
Evidemment, madame parle et comprend beaucoup de francais.
Well, there you are.
I just said, "Evidently, madame speaks and understands a great deal of French.
" Oh, I do, I do.
Oui, oui.
Madame, madame, au revoir.
Oh, but my friends aren't here yet.
Yes, I know, madame, but, uh I just remembered an appointment whoa, on the other side of town.
Au revoir.
Oh.
Oh, hi, honey.
Hi.
Hi, Fred, you just missed it.
I met the most wonderful man, and he changed my money and gave me 450 francs for each dollar.
A hundred extra francs for every buck?
Yeah.
Where is the guy?
He's gone.
Where is he?
Oh.
Will he be back?
I don't know.
Look, I'll give you half of mine.
Here, you give me $10, I'll give you Oh, here, thanks, Lucy.
Oh, that's awful sweet of you, honey.
That's all right.
Thank you.
Come on, we'll go and get the mail.
We'll see you later.
Thanks again.
Okay.
Have a good time.
That certainly is joli.
Thank you.
How much do you want for it?
Oh, I never sell my paintings.
You never sell them?
No never.
I could not sell my paintings.
You see, they are a part of me.
I could not sell a picture any more than I could sell my arm.
Well if you never sell your paintings, how do you expect to be discovered?
It is always the same.
When I die, then I will be discovered.
Look I just have to have one of your paintings.
I'll give you 500 francs for that.
Oh oh, I'm sorry, madame.
This picture is my life.
It took me three years to paint.
Sell three years of my life for 600 francs?
Madame, I told you, no.
I think I would turn down even a a thousand francs.
A thousand.
Oh, I'll take it.
Oh, oh, well, thank you very much.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Be very careful with it, madame.
Oh, I will.
You see, it is still wet.
Yes, yes, I will.
I'll go right to the hotel with it.
Oh, thank you so much.
By the way, what is your name?
Pierre Charpentier.
You see, after you die and become famous, I want to be able to tell my friends that I discovered you, and that I have an original Charpentier.
Well, it's been awfully nice discovering you, Pierre.
Oh, it was wonderful being discovered.
Au revoir.
Come on, Fred.
We don't want to miss that sightseeing bus.
I'm coming.
I told him not to forward these Christmas cards.
Just a minute, Fred.

Yeah, well, I don't care.
Ricky gave you your money back, didn't he?
Listen, thanks to me, you got to do something that very few Americans get to do.
You got to see the inside of a French jail.
Great.
Thanks to you, we almost spent the rest of our lives on Devil's Island.
Oh Oh, come on now.
Won't you forget it?
It's all over now.
Oh, he makes me so mad, Now, forget it.

Yeah, we got a genuine original.

We'll see who's got the best eye for art.
Okay, I'll show you the one I got for you.
All right, I got mine right here.
Look.
Isn't that beautiful?
Look.
Isn't that beautiful?
For heaven's sake.
The man said he'd rather cut off his arm.
I paid a thousand francs!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Oh, boy, this is good French pastry!
Ethel, there he is.
There who is?
Charles Boyer.
Where?
Right here.
Oh, not again.
Honey, this is the fifth time you've seen Charles Boyer today.
That is the back of his head.
I will know it anywhere.
In Hollywood, every guy you passed in the street was Clark Gable.
In Paris, it's Charles Boyer.
I don't care.
I have seen every picture he ever made and if that isn't Well, that's the way he would look if he had a beard.
I'm getting sick and tired of you and your imaginary Charles Boyers.
I don't want to hear another word about it.
All right, all right.
You don't have to get mad.
I think he's jealous.
Lucy, are you going to finish that pastry?
No.
Go ahead, help yourself.
Fred, did you get the itinerary for Europe yet?
Yeah.
We're going to stay over here in Europe a lot longer than we planned.
We are?
Here's a list of the places we're playing.
Well, that's good.
If you want to see someone who looks more like that man I keep seeing than anyone we've seen yet, look over there.
Lucy!
That really is him!
Well, it sure looks like him.
This time, I'm positive!
Come on.
Come on, let's Just a minute.
Quiet down.
Why?
What's the matter?
You're not going to go over.
Why not?
Because something awful is bound to happen.
Oh, don't be silly.
What could happen?
I don't know, I don't know, but I don't want to be embarrassed.
You somehow or other seem to attract trouble.
Oh, give me one good example where I ever attracted trouble.
All right.
We arrived in Paris, you went sightseeing, and we all wound up in jail as counterfeiters.
That could have happened to anyone.
All right, in Hollywood, you went to the Brown Derby for dinner, and Bill Holden ended up with a face full of pie.
That was purely an accident.
Van Johnson.
Well, that John Wayne.
That was not my fault.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Just a minute.
You can't go over there like that.
Why?
What's the matter?
Uh, you need lipstick.
Oh, I do?
Oh, you do, honey.
We'd better fix your face up a little.
He hasn't ordered yet.
It's him.
Yeah.
I just want to get rid of him.
I got an idea.
I'm going to go over there and talk to him.
Yeah, let's go have a chat Sit down, will you?
Two cornballs in this outfit is enough.
Excuse me.
I'm Ricky Ricardo.
Oh, oh, yes, of course.
How are you?
I'm glad to see you.
Sit down.
Thank you.
My agent cabled me about having lunch with you sometime this week.
I was going to call you at your hotel.
Oh.
I think it's about doing some television shows in the States on Four Star Playhouse.
Yes, well, uh, I didn't come over to talk business with you.
I came over to warn you.
Warn me?
About what?
Well have you ever heard about my wife?
Oh, yes, yes.
Uh, her name is Lucy, is that it?
That's right, yeah.
Yes, yes, I heard all those publicity stories about her.
Yeah, well, I got news for you.
Those were not publicity stories.
You mean they were true?
Yes.
Well, she must she must, she must be quite a character.
Well, she's, uh more than just a character.
She's a a Oh, yes, yes, we have a word for her in French: balle de vis.
What does that mean?
Screwball.
That's the word.
That's exactly the word.
Well, look, she's coming over here to ask for your autograph.
Play it safe- tell her you're not Charles Boyer.
Well, she certainly can see that I know, but she's already seen ten men today that she thought was you.
So, just tell her that she made another mistake.
All right, Charles?
Charles?
But I think you made a mistake, monsieur.
My name is Maurice, Maurice DuBois.
Thank you very much, Mr. DuBois.
It'll be a pleasure having lunch with you later on in the week.
Good-bye, Mr. Ricardo.
Thank you.
Oh, he's a nice fellow.
I've been watching him, Rick, and I don't know.
What do dames see in him?
Well, I guess he's What's he got that I haven't got?
Nothing.
It's just what you got that he hasn't got that louses you up.
We'll be right back.
Mm-hmm.
Pardon me.
Uh, I'm Lucy Ricardo, and this is my friend, Ethel Mertz.
: Oh, Mr. Boyer, how do you do?
It's happened again!
What?
I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you, lady, but I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
Oh?
Yes.
People are always taking me for Charles Boyer, but I'm not.
My name is Maurice, Maurice DuBois.
Oh oh.
Personally, I don't understand why people make the mistake.
Well, now that I see you up closer, I can tell that you're not Boyer.
Sorry to disappoint you, ladies.
You know, you don't even sound like him, does he?
No.
Well, good.
You know, that whole resemblance to Boyer has been my downfall.
Oh, how come?
Well, you see I am actor, too.
Oh.
And because I look like him, producers will not hire me.
And between you and me, I am a much better actor than he is.
Oh, come now.
I happen to think that Charles Boyer is a marvelous actor.
He is the greatest.
Ha!
Well, that's sour grapes if I ever heard it.
Well, huh, you can hardly blame me.
It has changed my whole life.
Oh, well, I can understand that.
Well, sorry we bothered you, Mr., uh Eh, DuBois.
Oh, yes.
Well, um uh, see you, uh, later.
Good-bye.
I'm sorry I'm not Charles Boyer.
That makes three of us.
I could have sworn that was him.
Yeah.
Huh?
Oh.
Come on, let's go.
Oh, you get your autograph?
No.
That wasn't Charles Boyer.
Are you kidding?
No.
No, it was some ham actor named Maurice DuBois.
Oh, what do you know.
He looked so much like Boyer.
Nah, not really.
Come on.
Oh, come in, Fred.
Hi, Rick.
What do you want?
Listen, did you give out any publicity about me having luncheon with Charles Boyer this week.
Of course not.
That must have been Don Sharp.
What's the matter?
These agents.
See the Paris Tribune?
No.
Listen to this.
"International Note.
" "Cuban Ricky Ricardo and French Charles Boyer "have a luncheon engagement this week here in Paris to discuss a deal for American television.
" Uh-oh.
How am I gonna keep Lucy away from this luncheon?
Well, you could lock her in the closet.
Cut it out, will you?
No, you know what I was thinking?
You know, the other day at that restaurant when I said to her that I was sick and tired of her imaginary Charles Boyer?
She thought I was jealous, right?
Uh-huh.
Well, what if I put on a big act and make her really think that I'm jealous?
You're not that good an actor.
Is that so?
Ricky did you see Buchwald's column?
Yes.
Are you really having lunch with Boyer?
Yes, I am.
Can I go with you?
No.
But Ricky!
I said no.
: Oh, why can't I go?
Mr. Boyer is my idol.
He's so romantic.
How can I leave Paris : I said, "No"!
I am sick and tired of hearing you talk about him.
"Charles Boyer, Charles Boyer, Charles Boyer.
" What is he, the end of the earth or something?
Well, no, he's just Yeeees, you just said what he was!
He's your idol!
"He's so romantic"!
Why, Ricky, you're jealous.
Jealous?
Ha!
You are.
Fred, will you pardon me?
This is a private matter.
Please.
I'll be glad to.
Thank you.
All right, now you know my secret.
I am jealous- insanely jealous!
But, honey, you have nothing to be jealous about.
Charles Boyer, he's just a movie star.
I haven't even met him.
And you're not going to.
Huh huh Why would I introduce a charming man like Charles Boyer to a gorgeous redhead like you?
Well You're not even going to get near him.
Do you hear me?
You're mine, mine, all mine!
Wow!
Who needs Boyer?
You don't, that's who.
Darling, I have to leave you now, but I'll be back to your arms as soon as I can.
: All right.
Wait for me, my love.
I will.
Good-bye, my sweet.
Good-bye.
My goodness!
Lucy, Lucy, is it true?
Is he really going to have lunch with Charles Boyer?
Oh, boy, this is your big opportunity, huh?
No, Ethel, I'm not going.
Why not?
I have a big problem.
Ricky is insanely jealous of Charles Boyer.
Oh, Lucy.
He is.
You should have seen him.
He was so mad, he was snorting like a bull, and his eyes bugged out something awful.
Worse than they usually do?
Yeah.
What's your big problem?
I should think you'd be delighted.
Well, it's flattering, but it's also very disturbing.
How would you feel if-if Fred were smoldering with jealousy?
Fred wouldn't smolder if he backed into a blowtorch.
I've just got to do something to prove to him that Charles Boyer doesn't mean a thing to me.
What can you possibly do?
Well listen, do you remember that actor we met in that restaurant?
That that Maurice DuBois, the one that looks like Boyer?
Yeah.
Ricky thought he really was Charles Boyer, right?
He sure did.
Well, I'm going to ask Maurice DuBois to come up here and make love to me right in front of Ricky.
And I won't pay a bit of attention to him, see?
And when Ricky sees that I'm not a bit impressed, he'll realize that he has nothing to be jealous about.
Oh, boy, this is one of your crazy schemes you can leave me out of.
Who asked you in?
Well, you always do drag me into your crazy schemes.
Well, this is one time I can do without you.
What's wrong with me all of a sudden?
Well, nothing, but this, I can handle by myself.
I know this sounds crazy, but I feel left out.
Well, all right, Ethel, come along if you want to.
No, I don't want to; I just wanted you to ask me.
Oh, well I'll see you later.
Okay.
Good work.
Okay.
Madame, perhaps, would like another cafe?
Oh, no, thank you.
I've already had seven.
Listen, are you sure you don't know Maurice DuBois?
I'm sorry, no.
Funny, I felt sure he hung around here all the time.
There he is.
Je vous demande pardon, madame.
This is Monsieur Charles Boyer!
Ha, ha.
So he fooled you, too, huh?
Well, good, that means he can fool my husband.
Here you are.
Merci, madame.
Merci.
Monsieur DuBois?
You are Monsieur DuBois, aren't you?
Oh, oh, yes, I certainly am.
Oh, it's nice to see you again.
Well, it's very nice seeing you.
I've been waiting for you for hours.
For me?
Yes.
I- I have something very important to talk to you about.
Oh, I'm sorry, but I have a luncheon engagement.
This is very important.
I have a job for you- an acting job.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Yes, it, uh  It's a romantic lead.
Do you think you can handle it?
Well, I don't know.
I've never done anything like that before.
I see.
Well, what kind of acting do you do?
Mostly Westerns.
French Westerns?
Yep.
Well, do you think that you can do an imitation of Charles Boyer?
: Oh Oh, I doubt it.
Oh, he's so so corny.
Corny?
My, you are bitter, aren't you?
Well, and that voice of his.
He always sounds like he has indigestion.
Don't worry about the voice.
That, you can fake; I'll coach you.
All right, I can try, but what's this all about, anyway?
Well, my husband, Ricky, is insanely jealous of Charles Boyer.
No, he is?
Yes.
'Course there's no sense to it.
We've been happily married for 15 years.
But I want to prove to Ricky that he has no reason to be jealous.
And where do I come in?
I want you to play a love scene with me in front of Ricky.
And when he sees I'm not a bit impressed, he'll realize that he has nothing to be jealous about.
Will you do it?
Well, you know, it's a tough assignment.
I'm a good actor, but I'm not sure I'm that good.
Well, we'll see.
Now, I'll give you ten dollars.
That's 3,500 francs!
Hey, that's a lot of money.
Yes, it is.
Remember, if you do it well, you never can tell what might happen.
I know a lot of pretty big people in Hollywood.
You do?
Well, in that case, I can't afford to turn you down.
Good.
Good.
Now, can you get out of this luncheon today?
This- oh, no, no, I'm afraid not.
No?
Well, all right, I'm at the Hotel Royal.
As soon as you have your little luncheon, come up and I'll start coaching you.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Fine.
I'll see you later.
Good-bye, Mrs. Ricardo.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Hello, Ricky.
Hi, Charles.
I've been just having a chat with your wife.
What?
!
Don't worry.
She still thinks I'm Maurice DuBois.
Good, good.
And, by the way, she told me you are jealous of Charles Boyer.
I put on a big act for her the other day because I wanted to keep her away from this luncheon, you know.
What did she want with you?
Wait, wait until you hear the plot she's cooked up.
She wants me Don't do it.
But you haven't even heard what it is.
It doesn't matter, don't do it.
Ricky, I think it might be a lot of fun.
She's hiring me to play the part of Charles Boyer.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
You see, she is really quite concerned about your jealousy, and she wants All right, Maurice, now you know what to do.
Let's pretend that Ricky is seated over there.
Go ahead.
Oh, no, no, Maurice.
What's wrong?
Charles Boyer doesn't kiss like that.
When you kiss a woman's hand, put some schmaltz into it.
Silent schmaltz.
Honestly, I don't know how you ever make a living as an actor.
I often wonder myself.
Well, for one thing, don't just sit there like a bump on a log.
Sit up, sit up.
Try to look romantic, like Boyer.
All right, and how does your Boyer look romantic?
Well for one thing, he gets an expression on his face like he just walked into the grand ballroom and smelled cauliflower cooking.
Oh, I see.
Like that, huh?
That's it.
That's the look.
That's good.
Now, now tell me you like me.
Madame Ricardo, I like you very much.
No, no, no.
The voice, the voice.
Oh.
When Boyer is being romantic, he doesn't just talk, he-he growls, he says, : "Ah, Lucy, I like you.
" Is that the way he sounds?
Yes.
Then I'm surprised he got as far as he did.
Just never mind.
Now you try it.
That's good!
No, no, no, no.
I was just clearing my throat.
Oh.
Well, keep it in.
That's good, that's good.
: Lucy, I like you.
You're so gor No, keep the face up.
Keep the face up.
Huh?
What?
Yes.
Remember, cauliflower cooking.
Ah, Lucy, I like you.
You're so gorgeous.
Good, but don't strain your voice now.
You've got it, you've got it.
You know, that's hard to do.
Whew, that Boyer must have throat muscles like a horse.
Well, remember the plan now.
You're to come by at 5:00 and tell Ricky you were just passing and thought you'd drop in.
Of course.
Well, good-bye, Mrs. Ricardo.
Good-bye.
I'll see you at 5:00.
Oh, uh, one more thing.
Don't get too close to Ricky.
He'll know you're a phony.
Oh, oh, I'll remember.
Good-bye, Lucy.
That's good.
That's good.
It's the phone, dear.
Oh.
Hello.
Oh?
Uh, yes, ask him to come up, please.
Lucy, leave the room.
Why, what's the matter?
Somebody's coming up here that I don't want you to meet, so leave the room go over to the Mertzes'.
Well, who is it?
Who's coming up?
Tell me.
All right, if you must know- it's him.
Him?
Charles Boyer, so leave the room.
Go.
That won't be necessary.
Lucy!
I am going to stay right here and prove to you that Charles Boyer doesn't mean a thing to me.
Monsieur Ricardo.
Oh, Mr. Boyer, will you please come in?
Mr. Boyer, I'd like you to meet my wife, Lucy.
Lucy, Charles Boyer.
Well, I'm delighted to see you.
Hi, there.
Won't you sit down, please?
Lucy, may I say that you are the most fascinating, the most exciting creature I've ever seen.
Charles.
Charles.
Charles!
Pardon me.
Charles, would you mind telling me what's going on here?
I'm sorry, Ricky.
I realize that you must think I'm a cad, but when I walked into this room and saw her, I took leave of my senses.
I'm not responsible anymore.
Ah, Lucy Lucy, I I know I could never have your heart, but at least let me hold your hands.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Lucy, how can you act so indifferent to me when you must realize how I feel about you?
You want some orange?
Oops!
Want some orange, Ricky?
No, thank you.
Delicious.
Hello.
Lucy?
Lucy, this is Ethel.
Ricky is playing an awful dirty trick on you.
Fred just spilled the beans.
What do you mean?
That Maurice DuBois really is Charles Boyer.
Keep him there now.
I'm coming right up.
Lucy, who was that on the phone?
Nobody!
Lucy, what was I saying before I was interrupted?
I don't know!
Ah, don't run away from this.
It was meant to be.
Lucy, I am drawn to you like a moth to a flame.
I cannot help myself.
Charles, I think our little game is over.
That telephone call must have tipped her off.
I'm afraid so.
Don't be silly.
I knew who you were all the time.
Well, I hope you're not too angry with us.
No.
Well, I must run along.
I'm supposed to be interviewed on television.
Oh, that's right.
You told me.
Well, thank you very much for being such a wonderful sport.
Not at all; it was fun.
Good-bye, Ricky.
Good-bye, Lucy.
Ricky Ricardo, that's a dirty trick!
What are you talking about?
I thought you said you knew who he was all the time?
Oh.
Well, I did, but if I hadn't, that was a dirty trick!
So So, you weren't even jealous or anything.
That was all a frame-up, huh?
Right.
I just wanted to keep you away from him to avert the catastrophe.
I don't trust you with celebrities.
Well, you see, you were wrong.
He was up here and what happened?
Not a thing!
Well Oh, oh, I saw him, I saw him!
He was just getting off the elevator.
I was getting on.
I'm goose bumps all over.
What was he like?
What was he like?
Oh, Ethel, he was just dreamy.
He's so French and so   Oh, boy.
He's just the living end.
Oh, was he romantic like we thought?
I wanted to ask him for his autograph, but I just couldn't do it.
Hi, Charles.
I'm sorry, Ricky, I forgot my hat.
Oh, come in.
Where is it?
I think I Excuse me.
I think I think I set it down on the couch.
Your hat?
Yes.
You forgot your hat?
Yes, I did.
Well.
Oh, Mr. Boyer, I'm terribly sorry.
I'm terribly sorry.
That's perfectly all right.
We'll have to get you a new hat.
Oh, are you kidding?
Mr. Boyer, while you're here could we have your autograph?
Why, certainly.
Oh, yes, please.
I brought my book Now, Lucy!
You'll have to write it twice now.
I saw your picture I saw your picture about the Casbah, where you smoked two cigarettes and everything.
I afraid it's out of ink.
No ink!
Oh, I filled it this morning!
Have you got a pen?
I filled it this morning.
Oh!
Lucy!
Oh, no!
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Boyer.
Milk milk will take that out.
All right, then, I'll get some.
Thank you.
Look, you want to borrow one of my shirts?
Yeah, borrow one of Ricky's shirts.
Oh, no, no.
No, that's all right.
I'll keep my coat on.
Oh, well, let me help you then.
That's all right.
Let me help you put your coat on.
That's all right.
Let me help him put his coat on!
Please, now!
I want to help him put his coat on!
No!
I'm sorry, Mr. Boyer.
That's all right.
We tore your coat.
Oh, don't think about it.
We'll mend it for you right now.
No, no, no, please.
Would you like for me to get my sewing kit?
No, that's all right.
Just let me get out of here.
No, no.
No, no, that's fine.
Charlie, I'm awfully sorry.
Oh, no!
Mr. Boyer, I'm terribly sorry.
Perfectly all right.
It's all right.
Never mind.
Au revoir.
No, no, no, no.
Don't say au revoir, dear.
Just say good-bye.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Come in.
Band manager Mertz reporting, sir.
Hi, Fred.
Hi.
And here's your mail.
Oh, thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Hey, this'll make Lucy happy.
What is it?
An invitation to the most famous spring fashion show in Paris- Jacques Marcel's.
Jacques Marcel, the big dress designer?
Yeah.
Oh, this was hard to get.
I had to pull a few strings.
I'd like to pull a string around your neck.
Why?
What's the matter?
What do you let me in for?
Do you know what that guy charges for his clothes?
Oh-ho-ho, Fred, they just want to go there so they can say that they've been there.
They don't want to buy anything; they want to look.
"Look"?
turning our wives loose in that place is like taking two mice on a tour through a cheese factory.
No, Fred, I-I don't think Oh, now, listen.
I met a guy yesterday from St. Petersburg, Florida, down at the American Express office.
Yeah?
His wife went to one of those showings.
He ended up shelling out 500 clams for one dress!
That's just the start.
Where they finish, nobody knows.
Well, gee, Fred, I don't want to break my promise.
Well, if you don't, the promise will break you.
Well, well Well?
I do want to make Lucy happy.
Well?
And if she goes to this place, and she's not able to buy a dress, Yeah?
she will feel miserable.
Uh-huh.
So, if I don't show her this invitation, I will actually be sparing her all of that misery.
Uh-huh.
I'll be doing her a favor.
You know, it's wonderful the way you're always thinking of Lucy.
Thank you.
Welcome back to the Husbands Union.
Thank you, Fred.
I lost my head there for a minute, old man.
Yes, you did.
Cheese it, the mice.
RICKY AND  Hi, girls.
Hi, fellas.
Well, where have you been all day?
Shopping on the Champs-Elysees.
Well, isn't that nice?
Fred, look at the bag I bought.
It only cost a thousand francs.
A thousand francs?
!
Relax.
That's $2.85.
Oh, I keep forgetting.
Honey, what did you buy?
Oh, a toy for Little Ricky and perfume for Mrs. Trumbull.
That bottle must be leaking.
I smell perfume.
Oh, no, dear, that's on me.
The sales lady says that after one good whiff of this perfume, you'd burst into flame.
Take a whiff.
Pow-wow!
Mmm-mm.
Uh, I'm wearing some of that potent perfume, too, Freddie.
Well?
Nice try.
Oh, I could have done better with a book of wet matches.
Oh, darn it, it isn't here.
It should have been here by now.
Wh-What's that, dear?
Our invitation to Jacques Marcel's fashion show.
Oh, oh, the invitation.
Yeah, well, uh, you know, I forgot to tell you I tried to get one, but they're very hard to get.
Only the, um you know, the fashion designers and the buyers, that's all that get them.
Oh, darn it!
Oh, I really wanted to go to that.
That's probably our last chance to see a big show, too.
Maybe some other time.
Hello.
Yes, this is Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh?
Jacques Marcel's secretary?
Yes.
Oh, no, we didn't.
Well, of course, we'll be there.
Tomorrow at 2:00.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
We're invited to the fashion show.
Gee, I wonder why we didn't get our invitation.
I have a feeling we did.
Ricky, where is the invitation?
The the invitation?
The invitation to the fashion show, where is it?
Honey, I don't By George, it did come in the mail!
How do you like that?
You lied to me.
You said this didn't come.
No, I did not.
I said they were hard to get.
It's my own fault.
He's beginning to think like me.
Promise me, you're only going there to look.
I'm disappointed in you.
You don't trust me.
I told you, I was only going to go there to look.
Ethel, need I say that the same goes for you?
You need not, Diamond Jim Mertz.
What are you going to wear, honey?
My brown jacket.
I think I'll wear my gray.
The one  Oh!
Did you ever see such clothes in your life?
Oh, Lucy, weren't they dreamy?
That blue satin suit was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Wouldn't I like to have something like that just once.
How about that wedding dress Bonjour, madame.
Entrez, s'il vous plait.
Oh, thank you.
Merci.
Oh, merci.
That's hand-embroidery on that wedding dress.
Oh, wasn't that beautiful?
Thousands and thousands of little There'll be four or us.
Oh, my, what dresses!
What dresses!
Gee, I can hardly wait for the fellas to get here.
: What are you gonna have?
A Jacques Marcel dress.
Oh, Lucy.
I've just got to have one.
I'm going to get one if it's the last thing I do.
Well, it will be.
Oh, here come the fellas.
Hi.
Hi there.
Did you have a good time?
Yeah, wonderful.
Ricky, it was the most beautiful thing.
Just magnificent clothes.
The most gorgeous clothes I've ever seen in my whole life.
Well, I'm glad you went and got a good look and got it out of your system.
Ricky?
No.
No what?
I'm not gonna buy you a Jacques Marcel dress.
That is not what I was going to ask.
Honey, I know you pretty well.
You know me well enough to know that I'm gonna pester you for that dress till the end of my days?
And do you know me well enough to know that if you do, the end might come sooner than you expect?
You never buy me anything.
What do you mean I never buy you anything?
How about that Don Lauper original I bought you in Hollywood?
That Don Lauper original.
That old thing?
When I bought you that dress, you promised me that you will never ask me for another expensive dress as long as you live.
Oh, I couldn't have said a thing like that.
You must be thinking of one of your other wives.
Ethel, I'll leave it up to you.
Did that sound like something I'd say?
I pass.
You see What do you mean, you pass?
I'd like to read something to you.
"February 28, 1955.
"If Ricky buys me a Don Lauper original, "I will never ask him for another expensive dress "as long as I live.
Signed, Lucy Ricardo.
" Let me see that.
Obviously, a forgery.
It won't help you; I had it photostated.
Oh Now, honey, why don't you be a good girl?
You don't hear Ethel asking Fred to buy her a new dress.
I'll be lucky if he buys me my lunch.
Look, Lucy, there's one of the models from the show.
Oh, yes.
Oh!
What was that?
That's one of the outfits she wore in the show.
She's too late for Halloween.
Yeah, and she's too early for April Fool.
Oh, Fred, honestly.
Now, that was really a beautiful outfit.
You just   Here comes another one.
Oh, isn't that hat really something?
Oh Did you ever see anything like that in your life?
It was absolutely out of this world.
That explains it- they're from Mars.
Oh, Fred, honestly.
You just don't appreciate high fashion.
High fashion?
That looks like it was made out of a potato sack.
Oh, Ricky.
Just ignore them.
Just ignore them.
Oh, this is the one I like.
I really love this one.
Ethel, did you leave our hotel room unlocked?
No.
Why?
She's got on my old flannel bathrobe.
Oh, Fred, honestly.
You two make me sick.
You just make me ill, that's all.
Oh, forget about the fashion show.
Let's have some lunch.
Yeah.
What do you want?
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
I am going on a hunger strike.
Oh, no.
Until you buy me a Jacques Marcel dress, no food will pass my lips.
Oh, Lucy, don't you think that's carrying If that's what she wants to do, it's all right with me.
Yeah, that hungers strike's a good idea.
Ethel, why don't you?
Oh, shut up.
It won't last very long anyway.
You just wait and see.
Until you put a Jacques Marcel dress on my back, I will put not a bite in my stomach.
Okay.
Okay!
Here we are, Rick.
What did you want?
Oh, listen, I got a plan.
I think I know how to break Lucy's hunger strike.
Oh, good.
What are you gonna do?
Well, I ordered some lunch sent up here, see, and we'll all gonna eat it right in front of her.
Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
What did you order?
Ethel, we just ate.
How can you eat again?
There is no sacrifice I wouldn't make for my friend Lucy.
What did you order?
Well, all kinds of tasty-looking stuff, you know.
I'll bet this will weaken her.
You know, she's been on this strike for three whole days.
I don't know how she can stand it.
Maybe she's sneaking food in on you.
No, no, no.
The clerk told me that she hasn't left the room or had anything sent up.
Holy cats!
If this doesn't work, I don't know what else I can do.
I do.
No.
I'm not going to buy her a Jacques Marcel dress.
By now, it's the principle of the thing.
And $500 is a lot of principle.
Now, will you help me?
Sure.
Okay.
Lucy!
Come out here, honey.
The Mertzes are here.
Come on, sweetheart.
Honey, I ordered some lunch for all of us.
Not for me.
I'm staying on my hunger strike.
Ethel: Oh Now, honey, you got to eat something.
You can't go on like this.
No, no, I'm fine.
Oh, Lucy, no dress is worth all of this.
Don't worry about me.
Somehow, food doesn't mean a thing to me anymore.
Oh, food!
Oh, honey  Here's the lunch.
Come on, everybody, let's eat.
Sit down, Ethel.
Okay.
I had a beautiful lunch sent up.
Oh, fine.
Come right in.
Look at that.
Oh, Ricky!
Isn't that gorgeous?
Isn't that wonderful?
Oh!
Oh, boy, look at that food.
Everybody, dig right in there!
Dig right in.
Huh?
Mmm!
Mmm, boy!
Mmm, delicious.
Mmm-mm.
Boy, that's good.
Mm, huh, huh, huh?
Honey, look.
Mmm.
Steak french-fried potatoes broccoli and hollandaise sauce.
Isn't that gorgeous, hmm?
Look at this, honey bread.
And look at that butter- lots of butter with the bread.
Isn't that nice?
Look, baby.
Look at this wonderful shrimp salad.
You ever seen anything so beautiful in your life?
Hmm?
Huh?
Look, look, honey, look.
Look at the French pastry.
Huh?
Isn't that gorgeous?
Isn't that pretty, huh?
Doesn't it all taste and smell good?
Come on, Lucy, sit down and dig into this.
Come on, baby.
Here.
Look, look, nice piece of meat.
Look at that.
No!
No!
Now, honey, you got to eat something.
No.
If you don't, I'll force it.
You can't force me.
We'll wait and see.
Hmm.
Make a nice sandwich.
Look at this beautiful sandwich, here.
Here.
No.
Lucy.
Lucy!
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth!
I'll make you open your mouth.
You gotta breathe some time.
You gotta open your mouth.
You're going to 'splode.
Open your mouth.
Come on, come on.
Lucy.
There.
Lucy.
Well, I don't know what else I can do.
You can buy me that dress.
I will not!
All right, then, I'll starve.
Okay, then starve!
Come on, Fred, I got a rehearsal.
Okay.
The coast is clear.
Good!
I thought they'd never leave.
Oh, so that's where you've been keeping it.
Ha-ha!
Aah-dee-dah And 85 Jacques cheese.
Dee-dee-dee-dah.
Say, Ethel, we're getting a little low on lettuce.
You'd better put it down on your shopping list.
Okay.
Let's see now, uh mustard.
Mustard?
Mustard, mustard Have to have mustard on a sandwich like this.
Doo-whoo-doo-doo.
Ha-ha!
Oh, boy.
Hurry up, take a bite.
Good, huh?
Mmm, wonderful.
Oh, Lucy, that was a regular Academy-Award performance you gave in front of Ricky and Fred.
You even had me believing you were starving.
Thank you.
Now then, what do you want me to bring you for dinner tonight?
Oh, I don't know, I'm kind of sick of sandwiches.
I'll bet.
How about a nice roast chicken?
Hey, that sounds good.
All righty.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Anything else?
No.
I got to cut down.
If I stay on this hunger strike much longer, I'll be as fat as a pig.
Are you ready for your dinner?
Yes, ma'am.
I got you a nice roast chicken.
Oh, wonderful.
I would've gotten you a great big one, but it wouldn't fit in my camera bag.
Oh, Ethel, oh, this is a beauty!
Come on in, Fred.
Oh, Lucy, oh!
Oh!
I don't know what's gonna happen to you if you don't eat Hi.
Hi.
Honey  You win.
I couldn't stand to see you suffer anymore, so I bought you a Jacques Marcel dress.
Oh, honey, how Oh, darling you've made me the happiest starving woman in France.
Well, honey, I think it's a great tribute to your willpower.
Oh, thank you.
Here, you're too weak.
I'll help you out.
Oh, no, that's all right.
I'll open it.
I feel my strength coming back already.
I can hardly wait to try it on.
Well, listen, let's go and eat something and then you can try it on.
Oh, no, I want to try it on first and then we'll eat.
You do, you want to try it on first?
Yeah.
Well, all right.
Try it on.
Oh, I'll take a picture of you.
Oh, no!
I'll, I'll On second thought, let's go eat.
Before I try it on, we'll go What kind of a camera is this?
It's a It's a-a Well It looks like a roast chicken.
It's a 3D picture of a roast chicken.
See, the depth Looks almost real, doesn't it?
Lucy Hmm?
you've been sneaking food in here all this time!
Yeah.
And I know who was mother's little big fat helper.
Oh Okay, that dress is going right back.
Oh, no, it is not!
Yes, it is!
Throw it, Lucy!
I got it!
Oh, no, catch it!
Ethel!
I got it!
Oh!
I got it!
I got it!
Oh, no!
Oh!
Open up, Fred!
No!
You you Indian giver!
Oh, you!
Oh, that was real nice of Marcel, you know.
He didn't really have to give me my money back.
Well, listen, at those prices, I could afford to be a good egg, too.
Yeah, but usually you buy something and then you're stuck.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
MAITRE D': Bonjour, monsieur.
Comment ca va?
Fine.
Comment ca va?
Two coffees, please.
Two coffees.
Well, I can't get over that Lucy.
I'd sure like to get even with her.
Well, you just did.
That's not enough.
Oh, come, come, come now, come.
Don't be bitter.
Now, that one had to be made out of a potato sack.
Yeah, and some of the potatoes are still in it.
Hey, you know, Fred, that gives me an idea.
Oh, what is it?
What do you mean?
I think I know a way how to get even with Lucy, and at the same time show her how silly this high fashion stuff is.
Well, let's hear it.
You know that-that little tailor across the hotel?
You mean where we had the band uniforms cleaned?
Right.
Yeah.
Now, suppose I make a deal with this guy to make me a a completely crazy dress out of a real potato sack and then I get a Jacques Marcel label and put it on it.
You think that Lucy would?
Of course she would.
Only make it two potato sacks.
For a couple of extra bucks, I'd like to have Ethel well-dressed, too.
Oh, wait a minute, we need hats.
Hats.
Yeah.
What about hats?
What can we do with that?
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, will you?
: How do I look?
Simply stunning.
Thank you.
There's another one down there right like it.
Fred, please.
Lucy wouldn't be caught dead wearing the same bucket.
Well, I should have known.
Yeah.
Hey, look.
Where?
That would make a wonderful hat.
Right across the street.
All I see over there is a horse.
That's right.
If he doesn't mind giving up his feed bag.
Oh, honey, so you have to go home without a Jacques Marcel dress.
You've been moping about it for two days.
I haven't even started to mope.
I intend to mope all the way across Europe.
I will be the mopiest, mopiest What's that?
Well, honey the other day when you called me an Indian giver, it got me right here.
So, I bought you a whole new outfit.
Oh, honey!
And here, Ethel, I'm no piker.
Here's an outfit for you, too.
For me?
Yeah.
From Jacques Marcel!
Fred, are you all right?
I'm fine.
Are you getting a fever?
No-no fever.
Oh, Fred!
Oh, my, I'm so glad you went on a hunger Oh, Fred, I can't Oh, I can't Oh, isn't it lovely?
I didn't see anything like this in the show.
I didn't either.
Of course not.
These are later than the show.
These are next year's fashions.
Well, you're the only two women in the world who have these.
No kidding?
We are?
That's right, yeah.
Oh, boy!
Gee, that's unusual fabric.
Well, leave it to Jacques.
What an inspired use of burlap.
Isn't that clever of him?
Yeah.
Oh, come on, Ethel, let's try them on.
Don't forget your hat.
Hat?
!
Hat?
!
Are they originals?
Of course they are.
I'll meet you back here.
We'll take you for a walk afterwards.
Oh, thank you, Frederick.
You're welcome.
How do I look?
Ethel, you never looked better in your life.
My, we're certainly attracting attention.
Do you think maybe these outfits are a little too extreme?
No, honey.
On you, it looks great.
Okay.
I never wore burlap before.
Honeybunch, you were made for it.
Oh, thank you, Fred.
Oh, Ethel, look, there's Jacques Marcel.
He's staring at us.
Yes.
I hope he thinks we're doing the clothes justice.
Oh, that hat on you.
You like it?
Yes.
Oh, they really look lovely, don't they?
You know, I think I'll go after him and thank him for letting us scoop the fashion world.
I think we should.
Well, duh, duh, duh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Why not?
I think it's a very nice gesture.
Oh, I think we should.
Yeah, I know, but We'll just say thank you for letting us be a few months ahead.
I love the I wouldn't do it if I were you.
What are you laughing at?
What are you laughing at?
I don't see anything funny.
Oh, you fell for this just like I fell for that hunger strike.
What?
What?
!
I had a little tailor made those dresses out of real potato sacks.
You mean, you mean, you mean, Jacques Marcel didn't make this?
No, a little tailor made the potato sacks.
Jacques Marcel didn't make these.
You think that's funny?
We have to leave.
We have to go.
I don't think I I borrowed that from a horse- the feed bag.
Oh.
That's a big bucket.
Honestly.
They look lovely.
I think you look very cute.
I don't think that's very funny.
I see.
Not till after 2:00.
All right, thank you very much.
They're having a private showing.
Nobody can get in there till after Well, don't you think you're getting away with a thing.
We're going to the restaurant next door, and on the stroke of 2:00, you are going up to Jacques Marcel's and buy me the dress I want no matter what it costs.
All right, all right.
All right.
And don't try to get out of your bargain.
I won't.
And Ricky, you got to pay for half of Ethel's dress for getting me into this.
I told you we shouldn't have taken these girls over there All right already!
I said I'd do it.
Come on I wish I never heard of Jacques Marcel.
Well, it serves you right for humiliating us that way in a public place.
I never heard of anybody doing anything quite like that in my life.
Come on, let's go.
Sometimes I wish I never left Cuba.
Yeah.
Trente mille francs.
Oh, that was good coffee, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Lucy, look.
What?
There's Jacques Marcel and his models.
Well, I'll be.
How do you like that?
That crook stole our stuff.
Well, girls, now we don't have to buy you any dresses.
You have the originals.
What's the matter?
We burned them.
Oh, no!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, Ethel, isn't that the greatest sight you've ever seen?
Imagine having an Alp right outside your window.
Oh, Lucy, it's all so beautiful, it leaves me absolutely speechless.
Yeah.
Why did you have to louse it up, Lucy?
That's the first time she's stopped talking since we've been married.
Oh, Fred, you haven't even looked out the window.
Haven't you any appreciation for beauty?
What are you doing, Ethel, fishing for insults?
Oh, Fred, now come on.
Isn't Switzerland the most breathtaking country you've ever been in?
Well, I'll admit, the scenery around Steubenville, Ohio, is not as pretty as it is here in Locarno.
Locarno?
Yeah.
: You don't even know where you are.
This is Lucerne.
Ethel, we're in Locarno.
No, Fred, we're in Lucerne.
Now, don't tell me.
After Paris, Ricky and the band were booked into Locarno.
It's right here on the schedule.
What does that say?
Lucerne.
Now, put your glasses on.
You know you can't read without them.
And you're the one that sat on my glasses in Paris.
Lucy, does this really say "Lucerne"?
Yes, Fred.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh!
What's the matter?
We're in Lucerne.
Yeah, we're in Lucerne, but I sent the whole band to Locarno.
What?
!
Fred, did you read that schedule without your glasses on?
Yes, I read that schedule without my glasses on!
Oh, Lucy, what are you gonna do with him?
If you sent the band to Locarno, why did you buy us tickets for Lucerne?
I didn't.
Ricky bought our tickets.
I had a headache and Oh, I'm getting out of here.
Why?
I'm not gonna hang around here and explain this to Ricky.
Oh, for heaven's He'll punch me right in the nose.
Oh, he will not punch you in the nose.
Now, listen, all the times Ricky's been mad at me, he never once struck me.
Well, you're bigger than I am.
Oh, Fred.
Don't let that Latin temperament scare you.
Rick's bark is worse than his bite.
Don't tell me he bites, too.
Now, Fred, you've got to tell him sometime.
Well, I'll tell him all right, in a year or two.
No, sir, you're gonna go right in there and tell him now.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Ethel.
We'll help you, Fred.
We'll go in there and we'll get Ricky in a gay, happy, carefree mood.
And when he's sort of off his guard, we will laughingly let the bad news sneak in, huh?
Well all right.
But what a way to go.
Come on, now, laugh it up.
Laugh it up now.
Gay, carefree, you know.
Hi!
Hi.
Hey, what's with you?
You're in good humor, huh?
Yeah, we're all so happy to be here in Lucerne.
Isn't the scenery beautiful?
Isn't the weather gay and carefree?
Yeah, yeah, Lucerne is certainly everything everybody said it was gonna be.
Yeah.
It just makes you want to laugh out loud, doesn't it?
I guess it kind of does, yeah.
Yeah!
Just think, the four of us, all together here in Lucerne.
Yeah.
Just the four of us.
By the way, the band is in Locarno.
Yes, sir.
Fred sent them there by mistake.
The the band is in Locarno?
Yeah!
You're fired!
Fired?
Yeah, fired.
What kind of a band manager are you anyway?
You can't fire Fred right here in the middle of the Swiss Alps.
Oh, I can't, huh?
What are you gonna do, get a Saint Bernard to manage the band?
He could do better than Fred.
The band is in Locarno.
Mira, que tiene cosa Hello?
I want some information, please.
Have you got a train from Locarno to Lucerne?
All right.
How long does it take?
Four hours?
I want to send a wire right away.
To the Ricky Ricardo Band.
Where are they?
I told them to meet us at the American Express office.
That was clever.
Hello?
At the American Express office in Locarno, that's right.
Here's the message: "Mistake in booking.
"Take the next train to Lucerne.
Signed, Ricky.
" Right.
Thank you very much.
There, now, you see how simple it is?
Everything's gonna be all right, huh?
All right, you're not fired, but that band better get here.
For heaven's sake, Ricky, you can't stay in this room all day worrying.
I can't help it.
I'm nervous.
If the band doesn't get here, I have to cancel the show.
Well, at least stop pacing.
When I'm nervous, I pace.
Well, do your pacing outside.
Let's go climb a mountain or something.
I'm not in a climbing mountain mood.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Come in.
Rick, our troubles are over.
What happened?
What do you mean?
In case the band doesn't get here on time, Yeah?
I lined up a local outfit that'll play with you tonight.
They're right outside.
A local outfit?
Yeah.
Are you kidding?
How can a Swiss band play Latin rumbas?
Well, they've been practicing for an hour.
Oh, Fred Oh, come on, honey, at least you can listen.
Please, try it, Rick.
They're musicians and music is the universal language.
They can play anything.
Well, all right, all right.
Oh, goody, goody.
Hey!
Come on in, fellas!
Come on.
Hello.
Guten tag, guten tag.
Guten tag.
Okay.
All right, fellas, "La Cucaracha.
" Give them the beat, Rick.
One, two Try eins, zwei.
Eins, zwei?
Ja.
Eins, zwei.
That is not "La Cucaracha.
" No?
No.
Das is not "La Cucaracha.
" Es ist nicht "La Cucaracha"?
Nein, das sounds more like der "Schnitzelbank.
" A "Schnitzelbank.
" Gewiss!
What are you doing?
Here they are.
I'm getting out our hiking outfits.
We are going to climb a mountain.
I am not gonna let you sit around here all day worrying.
No, I'd better hang around here.
What for?
You can't rehearse without the band, and they can't possibly get here until tonight.
Now, come on, honey, it'll do you good.
Well where's Fred and Ethel?
They're out renting some outfits, and the hotel's packing us a great big fat lunch.
Now, come on, hurry up and change.
Ah-yodel-lay-hee, a lay-hee-oh Yodel-lay-he, oh, yodel lay-he a- lady-oh, lady-ah.
Well, what are you laughing at?
Didn't you ever see Swiss mountain climbers before?
Oh, Fred, those are not mountain-climbing outfits.
You look like you came out of a Swiss clock.
I got it, honey!
Be careful now.
Watch your footing there.
Okay.
Come on.
Here, honey.
There we go.
Up we go.
Oh!
Yeah!
Boy, we made it!
Isn't it beautiful?
Oh, honey, why did I forget my camera?
Come on, Fred!
I'm coming.
Come on, boy.
You need any help?
Here you go.
Come on, Ethel.
Ethel!
Where's Ethel?
Ethel!
Ethel!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Come on, honey!
Honey, give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
Here you go.
Give me yours.
Come on.
What happened to you, Ethel?
Oh, I untied the rope.
I got tired of him yanking on me.
I was scared to death when I didn't find you on the end of that rope.
Really, honey?
Were you afraid you'd lose me?
I'll say.
That outfit you're wearing is rented.
All right.
Oh, honey, look how thrilling!
Isn't it beautiful, honey?
I'm sure glad you talked me into coming.
I feel better already.
Look down there!
Look how high up we are!
Isn't it wonderful?
Hey, is anybody hungry?
Oh, I am.
I'm starved.
Me, too.
Listen, it looks like it might snow.
You think it'd be better if we go to that shelter that we passed on the way over here and eat there?
Oh, no, honey, it's so beautiful.
Let's eat our lunch here on top of the world.
Yeah.
We may never get another chance like this.
Okay.
Come on.
We can?
Sure.
Let's eat it right here.
Oh, boy, I can't wait  Oh, boy, that was good.
Wasn't that lunch good?
Gee, this high altitude sure gives me an appetite.
What's your excuse at sea level?
Oh Fred.
Well, they certainly make man-size sandwiches at that hotel, don't they?
Hey, look, Rick, snow!
Oh, it is!
Yeah.
We'd better start back.
Oh, yeah, let's get going.
But isn't this beautiful?
It sure is.
Uh-huh.
Oh, fellas!
It's really snowing.
Here, honey.
Okay.
Start tying up.
Can I help you?
Can I get down down first?
Here, Ethel.
All righty.
I'll just carry it.
With that lunch you packed away, I doubt if there's enough rope left to go around you.
Oh, there's enough.
There's enough, don't worry.
Be sure there is.
Yeah.
I don't want to lose you again.
Oh, it's really coming down now.
Whoo, it's coming down!
I'll go first, huh?
Come on, everybody, mush!
Mush?
Mush!
Mush?
Whoo, boy!
Oh, this is a blizzard now.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, what a nice little place!
It's a nice little cabin, Ricky.
Yeah, it's chilly in here.
I wonder if we can get this old stove started.
Oh, big shot- now that he isn't the landlord, he's gonna turn on the heat.
There's no wood around here.
Oh, well, we don't need a fire.
We're gonna leave as soon as it stops snowing.
Yeah.
Oh, it's really coming down now.
Yeah.
Wow.
Look at that!
What?
There's a big cliff of snow hanging right over the cabin.
Oh, honey, you think that's dangerous?
No, I don't think so.
Fred, don't do that.
What's the matter with you?
Well, I thought one of those Saint Bernards might be going by.
I could use a shot of brandy.
Oh.
Will you stop that!
Come in here and close the door.
All right.
For heaven's sake.
Now, don't make a sound.
What's the matter, honey?
All that snow hanging over our head- a loud noise will cause an avalanche.
It's true- I read it in a book.
And you remember that picture Seven brides For Seven Brothers?
Yeah, that's right.
Somebody shot a pistol and it caused a great, big avalanche.
Yeah.
Now, don't anybody move.
You don't have to stand around looking like statues.
Just act natural, you know?
Well okay, All right.
but don't make any sharp noise.
Not even a sneeze.
Whatever you do, don't sneeze.
Oh, Lucy, why did you have to say that?
You know the power of suggestion.
Now we'll all have to sneeze.
Oh, Ethel, just because I said don't sneeze, four people are suddenly gonna Aah aah Easy.
Easy.
Aah Oh.
Whew.
Must be the dust in here.
Yeah.
What Oh, wow, that was close!
Oh, Fred!
An avalanche!
Fred!
An avalanche!
An avalanche!
Shh-shh-shh It's okay, honey.
It is!
It's all right, honey.
Oh!
Oh  Oh Phew!
Oh, honey It's all right, dear.
Honey, let me see if I got a match, honey.
Let me see, wait a minute.
That's all right, dear.
See- let's see, wait a minute.
Let me see if I can get the lamp.
Get a light here.
There we go.
Yeah.
Let me get the door.
Uh-oh, I can't open the door.
Oh, the snow is in front of the door!
It's all down in front of the door!
Over close to Rick now.
One, two, three.
At the same time.
One, two, three!
Oh!
Harder.
Harder.
One, two, three!
Ow!
Now wait a minute, it's no use.
It's no use.
The door Must be a lot of snow in there.
Oh..
How about the window, Rick?
The window!
Yeah.
Too small.
Even if we could open it, we couldn't get out there.
There's all snow in front of it, too.
All down in front of the window, too.
Well how'd they get out in Seven Brides For Seven Brothers?
They waited for the spring thaw.
Oh, great.
Well, I wouldn't mind that if we had five more brides.
Fred, this is no time to be funny.
No!
What's gonna happen to us?
Now, now, honey We're all gonna freeze to death.
That's what's gonna happen to us.
Now Oh, what a horrible fate, trapped under tons and tons of snow!
Now, dear Somebody will come along and dig us up.
Yeah, next spring.
Next spring!
Now, now, now, now, now, now Look, now, listen to me, you two.
Don't panic now.
Don't panic!
The first thing we got to do, the main thing we got to do is got to figure a way to get out of here.
After all, I got a show to put on tonight.
How can you think about a stale show when we're all about to be turned into human popsicles?
Well, don't pick on me.
You were the one who slammed the door.
Yes, and you were also the one who sneezed.
Yeah, and you were also the one that had the hot idea about going mountain climbing.
Oh, well, so I did a few wrong things.
I wasn't the only one.
We wouldn't be here in the first place if Fred hadn't bungled and sent the band to the wrong place.
She's right.
This is all your fault.
Is that so?
Is that so?
!
Oh, what a dumb- bunny trick!
It's your fault.
You're the one that sat on my glasses.
My fault?
Yes!
Well, actually, the whole thing is Ricky's fault.
My fault?
Yes.
If you hadn't left Cuba and come to America, we wouldn't have gotten married and we wouldn't be in Switzerland in the first place!
Mira, que tiene cosa Oh, never mind all that Spanish!
Mira, que tiene cosa, my foot!
I'm always blamed for everything.
All right, now, wait a minute now.
Wait a minute, fellas.
Settle down.
This is no time to quarrel.
The four of us are gonna spend the rest of our life together- what's left of it.
You're right, Ethel.
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm sorry I blamed you.
Well, I'm sorry I said your show was stale.
That's all right.
Fred, I'm sorry I called you a dumb bunny.
And I'm sorry you're so fat, you broke my glasses.
Oh, Fred!
Just a minute, everybody, please, now.
We have to concentrate.
We have to use our brains.
Well, now, let me see.
You stay out of this.
Well, I got a good idea.
What?
Why don't we look up the stovepipe?
If we can see the sky, we know it's not too bad.
Hey, she really has got an idea.
Yeah.
How about that?
You know, I knew if I waited long enough, you would come up with one.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Okay, Rick?
Let's see, what do we do?
Just take that elbow out.
Just knock it right down.
Yeah, right down.
Oh, yeah.
It's a good thing it isn't hot, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, you  Oh!
Oh!
Oh, honey!
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Oh, it seemed like a good idea, baby.
Well, you might not have much time left, but you're sure going out true to form.
Dear, well, did you see any sky?
No, I didn't see any sky!
Oh, baby  Well, what do we do now?
We'll just have to wait here until somebody comes and digs us out, I guess.
Oh Gee, It's been five hours already.
How much longer is it gonna be?
I don't know, but there's nothing we can do about it.
You think anybody knows where we are?
Well, there must be.
The people at the inn knew we come up here.
Well, they'll probably find us.
How can they under all this snow?
It may take days or even weeks.
Weeks?
Yeah.
Oh, I can't go that long without food.
I'm hungry already.
Me, too.
Well, we haven't got any food.
Not even one little crumb?
No!
You wanted to eat on top of the mountain.
You said, "We want to eat on top of the world.
" So you ate on top of the world.
Now we got no food, so forget about the food.
Just forget it.
We haven't got it.
Kind of a tough thing to do to forget about food.
Well, what are you gonna do?
What was that?
What was what?
I didn't hear anything.
I didn't neither.
Oh, fine, now I'm beginning to hear things.
Yeah.
There it goes again.
I heard it, too.
I didn't hear anything.
Maybe it's the ice breaking.
Maybe it's the ice breaking, yeah.
No.
That sounded like paper rustling.
Well, it's probably a mouse.
Yeah, a mouse.
Well That's all we need now.
I smell cheese!
So do I!
Me, too!
It's that mouse!
He brought his own cheese!
Well, I want some of it.
So do I!
A pretty smart mouse.
He brought his own mustard, too.
Lucy, what you got under your coat?
Nothing!
Nothing!
Lucy, what you got under your coat?
Nothing!
Come on!
Oh, it's mine.
A sandwich!
It's mine, it's mine!
I want a bite of it!
No, no, it's mine.
You had yours.
Well, give me a bite of it!
No, it's mine.
Fred, let's take it away from her!
No, it's my sandwich!
Just a minute, just a minute.
She's right.
We ate ours.
It's her sandwich.
So there.
Besides, it'll be better this way.
One of us will be alive and strong.
When the rescuers get here, they can tell how brave we were till the end.
Well, it is mine.
Of course it's yours, honey.
You have every right in the world to go ahead and eat your sandwich- even though we're standing here in front of your eyes, starving to death.
Oh, all right, I'll divide it.
Oh, Lucy, I knew you would.
Gee, thanks.
Thanks.
Oh, boy, is that good.
Mmm Oh, dear.
They're never gonna get us out of here.
Now, honey.
She's right.
We're doomed.
Now, don't talk that way.
Gee, I wouldn't believe the end would be like this.
I'm too young to go.
So am I.  Now, get ahold of yourselves.
Get ahold of yourselves.
Yeah.
If this is it and I've got to go, I want to go with a clear conscience.
Fred, I've got a confession to make to you.
Well, what is it, honey bunch?
You remember when we were married, I said I was 18?
Yeah.
I was 19.
I got something to tell you, too.
What?
You were 24.
Oh While we're on the subject, I got a confession to make to you.
What's that, Fred?
Well, Rick, I've been charging you ten dollars a month more rent than anybody else in the building.
I got another confession to make.
Every month I gave them back the ten dollars.
Oh, boy, if I thought I was gonna get out of here alive, would I let you have it?
Ricky, don't you have a confession to make?
Not me- I'm no fool.
We might be saved.
Well, I got a confession to make.
What's that, honey?
I got another whole sandwich in my knapsack.
Well, you know, now that I think about it, I do have a confession to make.
What?
While you were taking a nap, we ate your sandwich.
Oh, what a dirty trick!
We saved you a quarter, though.
Oh.
Well, what's three quarters of a sandwich between us and eternity?
That's true.
Shh!
I hear something.
What kind of something?
I hear music.
Some strange, far-off music.
Uh-oh, maybe we're closer to eternity than we think.
I hear it, too.
So do I. Good, at least we're all going the same place.
I don't hear anything.
That figures.
Hey, now I do.
Yeah!
Oh, that's a band!
Yes, it's band music.
We're in here!
They're coming!
Here we are!
We're in here!
Don't go away!
We're in here!
Here we are!
Fred, the band!
Bravo!
Wonderful!
Honey!
How did you find us?
Oh, when you didn't come back to the hotel, we got worried.
Oh.
Ja, ja.
It was only few feets of snow.
Only a few feet of snow?
You didn't have to dig for a long time?
No, no, no, no.
How do you like that?
Herr Ricardo, may we have another chance?
We have been practicing all afternoon the "Cacarucha.
" Sure, listen, I'm so happy to see you, I don't care what you sound like.
You got the job.
Oh, wunderbar!
Playing there together!
Very good, very good.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Well!
Fred, are you sure this is the right hotel?
Well, the sign said "Hotel Grande.
" Well, it is kind of picturesque.
Why did you bring us to this picturesque dump?
So it's not the Astor.
And as long as I am Ricky's band manager, I'm supposed to save money.
Well, that's right, Fred, so ring for Conrad Hilton.
Oh, my goodness.
Boy, I sure hope our mail catches up with us.
I haven't heard from Mother in two weeks.
Well, Ricky has gone around to pick up the mail at the American Express office.
He'll probably bring you a whole slew of it.
Oh, he'd better.
Today is Little Ricky's third birthday.
I don't even know if he got my birthday presents or not.
Oh, he'll get the presents all right.
I mailed them a couple weeks ago.
Oh, brother, if you mailed them, he'll be lucky if he gets them for his 23rd birthday.
Will you get off of my back?
Where is everybody?
Even the owner won't stay around this old trap.
Ah, just a minute.
It may be a little old, but it's cheap.
Well, that makes two of you.
Buon giorno.
Buon giorno.
How are you?
Hello.
Good morning.
Hi.
I'm Fred Mertz.
I wired for reservations.
Hey, Signore Mertz, I'm Signore Nicoletti.
Welcome to the Grande Hotel.
Thank you.
Are our rooms ready?
Eh, si, signora  Fine, fine.
Shine, signore?
Not now, kid, not now.
Eh!
Che ti ho detto!
Va via!
Aw, he's cute, isn't he?
Yeah!
Well, let's take a look at our rooms.
All right.
Scusi, scusi, signora, she's a no work.
Who's a no work?
Elevator- she's a no work.
She's a bust.
The whole idea of coming here, she's a bust.
All right, all right.
How far?
She's a four flight up.
Four flights!
Mmm, come, come.
Okay.
Oh, boy, some hotel!
And here she is, the best room in the hotel- the bridal suite.
Hey?
How you like, eh?
Hey, come up, come up.
Just one more flight.
Come up, come up!
Oh, they're kidding with this four flights.
Oh, I can't believe this.
We climbed an Alp last week, and it wasn't this bad.
That elevator, she's a no bust, she's a pooped.
The very best place in the hotel- the bridal suite.
The bridal suite.
I hope the people around here marry while they're young.
Where's our room?
She's one flight upstairs.
One flight up!
What did you give us- the bridal suite for mountain goats?
Come on, Ethel.
No, you go ahead.
I got to stay at this level for a while or I'll get the bends.
Be, be, if you need anything, just call me up, eh?
Don't forget.
Grazie.
Thank you very much.
Well, guess I'll take a look at that wonderful view he was talking about.
Oh, it is pretty out there.
Hi!
You can say that again.
What's the matter with Fred?
Is he crazy or something?
No, he's trying to save money.
Did you get the mail, honey?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Anything for me?
Yep.
What's this?
A box springs without springs?
We got four letters from Mother!
Oh, good.
Now, which one was mailed first?
Ethel, you ought to see our room.
There's a flock of pigeons right outside the window.
Those aren't pigeons up there, they're angels.
Here.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, dear!
What's the matter, honey?
Little Ricky has a bad cold and Mother has kept him out of nursery school for three whole days!
Well, honey, you know how kids are.
They all get colds.
He'll be all right.
You sound just like a father: "They all get colds.
He'll be all right.
He'll be all right.
" Oh, wonderful!
What does that letter say?
Says he's all right.
See?
Fred, here's a letter from Mrs. Trumbull.
Well, that was nice of her to write.
Well, let's see what she has to say.
She collected the rents for last month.
Good girl!
And she says the furnace broke down last Monday and there was no heat all week.
"The repairman finally fixed it yesterday and I'm enclosing the bill.
"  $118.00!
Is she off her nut?
Oh, now, calm down, scrooge.
It's cold in New York.
She's got to keep the tenants warm.
It would have been cheaper to send them all to Florida for the winter.
$118!
That old doll is off her   You're in luck, you got a soft one.
Oh, dear!
What's the matter now?
Mother doesn't say a thing about the birthday presents we sent.
Well, you know how your mother is.
She always forgets to tell you things.
Oh, no, honey, she wouldn't forget to tell me that.
He just didn't get them, the poor little thing.
Fred, are you sure you mailed those birthday presents?
Yes, I'm sure I mailed those birthday presents!
Poor baby, all alone in New York on his birthday, no birthday presents.
He'll think nobody loves him.
Oh, now, honey, come on.
Hey, I tell you what.
We'll call New York and you can talk to him.
Right now, honey?
Sure.
Oh, thank you!
Where's the phone?
I saw one downstairs in the lobby.
Downstairs?
Come on.
Let's put the call through right now.
I'll see you later, honey.
Okay.
You know something?
It's a lot easier coming down these steps than going up.
Long distance, please.
Long distance?
No, long distance.
Long-a distanza.
I want to make a long-distance call.
Oh.
They're switching me to an operator that speaks English.
Hello?

It's his birthday today, and I'm just lonesome for him.
Aw!
I'm sorry.
You know, he looks something like you.
Si.
Of course he's much younger.
I used to be younger.
My little boy will be three years old today.

And then he said, "It's a my birthday today, too, signora.
" Isn't that amazing?
Not half as amazing as the fact that you fell for it.
Oh, Fred, you're such a cynic.
Don't pay any attention to him.
He thinks everybody in the world thinks just like he does.
Come in.
Well, hello.
Signora, this is my cousin Theresa.
She's a her birthday today, too.
Well, that's wonderful.
Congratulations, Theresa.
Would she like some candy?

No, she doesn't.
Happy birthday, Theresa.

You tell the kids to wait here.

Well, my goodness.
She's a no their birthday, too.

Hey, what do you know?

Hello?
Yes?
Yes, this is Mrs. Ricardo.
Put them on.
Hello, baby?
Hi, honey, happy birthday!
Are you being a good, little boy?
Are you having a nice birthday, honey?
Did you open your presents yet?
Are you minding your grandma?
Just a minute, doll, don't go away.
Oh!
Listen, sweetie, we're having a birthday party for you over here with a lot of little children and they have something to say to you.
Now, now, you listen now.
: Okay.

Did you hear that, baby?
Happy birthday, son!
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday, boy.
Happy birthday.
Buen cumpleano.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Gee, these Italian trains sure are cramped.
Imagine one seat for four people.
Ethel, will you stop complaining?
Well, it's true- they're not very roomy.
They're roomy enough.
It's just that you're roomier.
Oh Well, it's not so bad now that Lucy's not here.
Yeah.
Where'd she go?
Just out to stretch her legs.
Honestly!
What's the matter?
There's a man out there leering at me.
He's a typical masher.
Lucy, why is it that every time you get on a train, you start imagining things?
I am not imagining things.
I know a masher when I  There he is now.
Now, Ricky, don't lose your temper.
Why should I lose my temper?
Aren't you going to beat him up?
What for?
"What for"?
Oh, honey, calm down.
He didn't do anything.
Well he was thinking.
Where was I sitting?
Right beside me.
Where?
Gee, it was there a minute ago.
Come on, move over.
Shove over.
Get over, Fred.
Come on, get over.
I'll get over.
Let me get my dress.
Come on.
Okay.
Such a train.
Fred, at what time do we get to Rome?
Oh.
Well, that's only just about one more hour.
That won't be so bad in this torture.
Well, I mean, that-that's, uh What?
!
What?
!
You mean we have to sit like this all night?
Well, it's only 13 more hours.
If I could only reach you, I'd punch you right in the nose.
Fred, why didn't you get us berths?
Well, it's cheaper this way.
Oh, fine.
Well, as Ricky's band manager, it's my job To save money.
To save money.
I appreciate that, Fred, but you got to draw the line someplace.
Oh, we're lucky he hasn't got us hitchhiking.
Will you stop yapping?
Oh, 13 more hours in this sardine can.
Sardines were better off.
They got all that oil to wiggle around in.
Well, let-let's try to get some sleep, huh?
Sleep?
Oh, Lucy, it's no use.
We've got to have more room.
This is all Fred's fault.
Let him stand up.
Fred.
Wake up, sleeping beauty.
You couldn't wake him up with a stick of dynamite.
Hey, I got an idea.
Hey, look, there goes Gina Lollobrigida!
Where?
Where?
Now, what's the big idea?
Well, you got us into this.
You can just stand up.
Ethel, I'm not going to forget this.
Fred.
Oh!
What are you trying to do?
Oh Honestly!
Oh, honey, help me.
I can't move.
I'll help you.
Here, dear.
Oh, dear.
I may never play the violin again.
Where are we?
Where are we?
We're just pulling into the station.
Oh.
Come on, Fred.
Help me with these bags.
Here, I'll take this one.
Oh, boy.
Give me that one.
Honey, there's that man again.
Yeah, he is looking kind of funny at you.
I told you he was a masher.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Excuse me, signor.
I am afraid I have given the wrong impression.
Yeah, well!
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Vittorio Fellipi.
Vittorio Fellipi Yes.
Vittorio Fellipi I produce films here in Italy.
Oh, yeah.
Oh!
Are you the Vittorio Fellipi?
Yep.
Oh!
I've seen all of your pictures in America, and they're just wonderful.
They're, they're, they're so realistic and earthy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, we'd better introduce ourselves.
My name is Ricky Ricardo.
Ricky Ricardo, well!
I read you were traveling in Europe.
Oh, you did.
How about that?
That's nice.
He read it in a paper.
And this is, uh, this is my wife, Lucy.
How do you do?
How do you do, madame?
And Mrs. Mertz.
How do you do?
Hello.
How do you do, Mrs. Mertz.
And Mr. Mertz.
Hi.
Glad to know you, sir.
How are you?
Grazie.
I shouldn't have been staring at Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, that's all right.
But you see, she happens to be just the type I need for a new picture.
Who, me?
Yes.
Tell me, Mrs. Ricardo, have you ever considered acting?
ETHEL, RICKY AND  Has she ever considered acting?
Well uh : The calla lilies are in bloom again.
Really, they are.
I mean : Oh, those calla lil- mama mia!
- they got to be a-blooming.
Very nice, very nice, indeed.
Look, here, Mr. Ricardo, here's my card.
If your charming wife would be interested in auditioning, call me, please but do it soon.
You see, we start production in a few days.
Oh, yeah.
It was very, very nice meeting all of you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Arrivederci.
Arrivederci.
Arrivederci.
Good-bye.
Arrivederci.
Poor man.
What are you doing?
I'm getting in the mood for my Italian picture debut.
Arrivederci, mi amore.
Arrivederci.
Oh, boy, Rome!
Isn't it wonderful?
Have you seen it?
Seen what?
The Colosseum!
Oh, isn't it magnificent?
Aah, it's nothing, Rick.
Nothing!
Smaller than the Yankee Stadium.
Joe DiMaggio would have hit 80 home runs in that hat box.
Oh, what can I expect when I expose him to culture?
Come on, Lucy, take a look at it.
I saw it.
Listen, here's a big article about Vittorio Fellipi in here and-and pictures of some of the actresses he's discovered.
Aren't they earthy?
Wow!
Oh, I don't think those Italian actresses are so much.
Not one of them has got her hair combed.
Well, they look great to me.
Hmm, if I let my hair go like that, you'd never let me hear the end of it.
Honeybunch, if the rest of you looked like that, I wouldn't care if you were bald.
Oh, fine.
Ricky?
Yeah, honey.
Do you like earthy women?
What's earthy?
That.
Well, we don't call that earthy in Cuba.
Oh?
What do you call it?
We have five words for it: Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Come in.
The hangers you called for, signor.
Oh, yeah, yes.
Oh, uh Signor Bellboy.
Si, signora.
Would you, uh, translate this story for me on Vittorio Fellipi?
I don't understand the Italian, you know.
Si, si, con piacere.
Uh, it says here: "Signor Vittorio Fellipi has announced "the starting date of his newest picture "which will be called, uh Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!
How about that?
It's the same thing in Italy.
Scusi, signora.
The name of the picture will be Grappolo Pungente.
Grappolo what does that mean?
It means "Bitter Grapes.
" "Bitter Grapes"?
Si.
Oh, what else does it say?
"The picture will be filmed in color and will be shot in and around Rome.
" Uh-huh.
Go on.
That's all there is.
E finito.
Oh.
Well, thank you very much.
Belle bambine tutte queste, ma come sono belle!
Bellissima.
Would you like to take the magazine with you?
Oh, grazie.
You're welcome.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Oh Gee, did you hear that, honey?
It's going to be called Bitter Grapes.
I wonder what part they want me for.
Oh, you're probably going to be one of the bunch.
Fred, that's funny.
Very funny.
Gee, I got to find out about the grape vineyards- how the workers act, what they do there.
Lucy There must be some grape vineyards near here someplace.
Lucy I bet I can learn all about them in a couple of hours.
Oh, no, you don't.
Why not?
Look, honey, Italy has enough problems already.
I don't want to have to worry about you lousing up the entire grape industry.
Oh All I want to do is soak up a little local color so I'll know what I'm acting about.
What could possibly happen to me?
Well, I could answer that, but we're only gonna be here ten days.
Oh Come on, Fred.
Okay.
Let's check the theater.
So long, Fred.
See you later.
No funny business- promise?
All right, all right.
All right.
See you later.
Come on, Ethel, let's go.
Go where?
To the grape vineyards!
Where else?
You promised Ricky you wouldn't.
I did not.
I promised him no funny business.
Soaking up local color for acting purposes happens to be a very serious business.
Oh, brother.
Besides, the only reason he doesn't want me to go is 'cause he doesn't want me to be in that picture.
Now, don't start that he-doesn't-want-me- in-show-business stuff.
Well, he doesn't.
How could I find out where the grape vineyards are?
Just look in the yellow pages of the phone book.
Operator, would you ask the bellboy to come up to 605, please?
Thank you.
I'll ask him where they are.
So, you find a vineyard.
What are you gonna do about the, uh, fact that you don't speak Italian?
I know a few words.
When I don't know, I'll shrug.
How can you shrug a conversation?
Ethel, you have been in Italy for a week.
Haven't you learned anything?
What does this mean?
It's wonderful?
Right.
How about this?
Who knows?
Very good.
Uh Don't cut the spaghetti; wind it around the fork!
No.
What's this?
Ooh, I give up.
What is it?
Get me a large pizza.
Come in.
Si, signora, you sent for me?
Yes.
I'd like a little information, please.
I'd like to know a little bit about the wine industry, how they make the wine, how they pick the grapes, and how they press the juice out with their feet.
Are there any grape vineyards around here?
Well, uh, there's only one little town called Turo, where they still make wine like that, you know.
All other wineries are modern.
They use big machinery.
Oh, oh.
Well, where is this Turo?
Oh, it's right on the outskirts of the city.
Oh, well, thank you very much.
Prego.
Turo, Turo.
You want to come along?
No, thanks.
What am I gonna tell Ricky when he asks where you are?
Tell him anything you want.
I have nothing to hide.
Tell him the truth.
Okay, I'll tell him the truth.
Don't you dare!
No, I won't.
All right.
Andiamo, andiamo!
Buon giorno, buon giorno.
No, e troppo caldo.
Allora, sta sera.
Magari, si.
Senti, senti.
Silenzio, silenzio!
C'e tanto lavoro sta mattina.
Fatte silenzio, presto!
In fila.
Rosa, Theresa.
Aspetta, aspetta un momento.
Lei puo pigiare tanta uva.
Quanta sei bella!
Thank you.
Andiamo, andiamo, andiamo.
Andiamo subito.
E che vuoi da me?
Che vuoi, che hai visto?
Vai al lavoro subito.
Vai a lavorare, cammina.
Eh, tu, vieni qua.
La raccolta e stata buona e noi due dobbiamo pigiare tutta questa uva.
Preghiamo che non stare qui fino sta notte.
Fa presto.
Eh, vieni dentro!
Lucy?
Lucy?
Oh, hi, Rick.
Is Lucy back yet?
No, she's not here.
Well, good-bye, Rick.
Ethel!
Come back here.
Where is Lucy?
Lucy?
Yeah.
Vittorio Fellipi called and he's coming over.
Where is she?
Ethel, where did Lucy go?
Where did Lucy go?
Will you stop repeating everything I say?
Where did she go?
Well Ethel, did she go shopping?
I promised not to tell.
Did she go around sucking up local color?
"Sucking up lacal color"?
No, I don't think so.
Ethel!
Yes.
Mira que tiene cosa que se lo dice, lo repeti que no se metiera mas revoli aqui en italia.
Ricky, she only did it because you were trying to keep her out of that movie.
What do you mean keep her out of that movie?
I just don't want her to go around and get herself into trouble again.
Really?
Why would I ask Vittorio Fellipi to come over here if I didn't want her in the movie?
Why, that's right.
Sure!
Now, don't you worry about it, Ricky.
She just probably picked a few grapes and she's on her way home right now.
Yeah, well, I hope you're right.
Yeah, I'm sure of it.
No, I'm a-pooped.
Abbasta!
Dai, lavora!
Poverina, e che credi?
Ti piglia la paga senza far nulla?
Naah!
Oh!
Allora ci vogliamo divertire de vero, eh?
E va bene, adesso.
I'm sorry, Signor Ricardo, I- I cannot wait any longer, really.
Oh, gee, that's too bad.
She's gonna be awful sorry that she missed you.
Oh, she's so anxious to be in your picture.
I'm sorry, but you see, I have to go back at the studio.
I'm late.
Well, just a few minutes longer.
Just I'm sure she'll No!
Oh!
Oh, Signor Fellipi.
How do you do?
Oh, you'll have to excuse the way I look, but I've been working in the grape vineyards so I could get the proper atmosphere for working in your picture.
Boy, when it comes to soaking up local color, you don't mess around.
Lucy, why don't you go and wash that blue stuff off?
I tried to.
It won't come off.
But, Mrs. Ricardo, I'm afraid you misunderstood.
You see, Bitter Grapes is just a a symbolic title.
The picture has nothing to do with the grape industry.
And besides, you see, I had you in mind for a small part as a a typical American tourist visiting in Italy.
Oh, well, fine.
Oh, it isn't fine at all.
You see, we're shooting the scene tomorrow morning in color, and I couldn't take a chance that you would be back to normal by then.
Well well well, couldn't I be a typical American tourist who who was homesick for America and that's why I'm blue?
Oh, no.
No, no, I'm sorry.
Well, could I be a a typical American tourist who fell in a wine vat?
No.
Oh, please, I'll do anything.
I'll dye my hair.
I'll do anything.
Mrs. Ricardo, please.
You know, the part isn't big enough to go through all that trouble, really.
Well, it's very nice of you to come over, Mr. Fellipi.
It was nice meeting you.
Thank you.
I'm awfully sorry, Mrs. Ricardo.
I'll shave my head.
I'll wear a mask.
No.
Good-bye, Mr. Mertzer.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Mrs. Mertzer.
Good-bye.
It was Just a minute.
Mrs. Mertzer, would you be interested in playing that part?
Would I!
Good.
Oh!
Then report tomorrow morning at my studio at 8:00.
You are a typical American tourist if I ever saw one.
Oh, thank you!
Oh, thank you!
Good-bye.
Yes, I always Oh, I'll be right there at 8:00.
Oh, imagine me in an Italian movie.
This is only the beginning.
I may end up being a star.
Arrivederci, mi amore.
Mi amore, arrivederci.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Hi.
You know you've done crazy stunts before, but this is the craziest.
I don't care.
I just wanted to make sure that I got to swim in the Mediter-r-r-ranean at least once.
But it's such a cold day.
Wasn't it freezing?
: Y-Y-Y-yes.
Go and put some warm clothes on.
Ok-k-k-k Ok-k-k-k 'K-K-K-K-kay, yeah, Okay.
go ahead, go ahead.
It was good, though; I liked it.
I can't believe it, Ethel, that's all.
I just can't believe it.
Oh, if you'll just stop talking, I'll prove it to you.
Where's Lucy?
Getting out of her bathing suit.
There.
All right, Ethel, I'm convinced.
I don't know why I ever doubt anything Miss Crazy Quilt does.
Yeah, you should know better than that by now, Fred.
Are you all packed?
Yeah, and when you finish, I'm gonna send all the baggage down to the bus depot.
The bus depot?
Isn't there a train to Nice?
Yeah, but the bus is cheaper, and you know me.
Boy, do we know you.
Yeah.
Besides, we'll get to see more of the country if we go by bus.
Bus?
What's this about a bus?
Well, well, if isn't the poor man's Florence Chadwick.
Fred wants to go to Nice by bus.
The train's faster, but I vote for the bus because it's cheaper.
Well, I vote for the train.
And I vote for the train.
I vote for bicycles.
There, you see?
Bicycles?
!
Yeah, bicycles.
How'd that get on the ballot?
Everybody in Italy rides bicycles.
Why shouldn't we?
From here to Nice?
Oh, I looked it up on the map and it's only about that far from here to Nice.
Have you ever tried riding that far on a bicycle?
That's probably a hundred miles.
That's a hundred miles?
Actually, Nice is about 35 miles from here.
There, I knew that couldn't be a hundred miles.
Well, you'll never get me up on a bicycle.
On behalf of bicycle seats everywhere, thank you.
Oh, Fred.
Let's forget it, honey.
Yeah.
What is the matter with the three of you?
You wouldn't climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower.
You wouldn't ride the ski lift in Switzerland.
You won't swim in the Mediterranean and now you don't want to bicycle along the Italian Riviera.
Nothing personal, but I sure am traveling with three wet blankets.
Some group- three wet blankets and a crazy quilt.
Well, I don't care what you do.
You get bus tickets or train tickets, whatever you want.
Well, that's better.
I am going to Nice by bicycle.
Okay, you can go to Nice whichever way you want to go.
Very well, I shall.
All right.
That's telling her, Rick.
Yeah, no dame's gonna lead you around by the nose.
Yeah.
Fred.
What?
You'd better rent me two bicycles.
What?
!
What?
What am I gonna do?
I can't let her ride all over Italy by herself.
I may never see her again.
Yeah.
Now, now, go ahead, get two bikes.
You and Ethel go on the bus and we'll meet you there.
Well, if you're gonna do it Let's do it, too, huh, Fred?
You can get one of those bicycles built for two.
Yeah, that'll be fine for you, but what am I gonna ride?
Ah, you know, it might be fun at that.
Well, it'll be an experience.
Yeah.
Honey you win.
We're all going to Nice by bicycle.
Well, wonderful.
Fred, you go ahead and rent some bicycles for all of us, huh?
Okey-dokey.
That won't be necessary, Fred.
Why not?
I just did.
Boy, I never seen so many hills in my life.
Ooh, are my legs tired.
That's good for 'em.
Makes strong leg muscles.
Oh, sure.
Just what I need.
I can play the conga drum with my feet.
Well, let's rest awhile.
Wait for Fred and Ethel.
Don't tell me that the six-day bicycle racer is getting tired.
Eh, just a little.
But I have an idea that Nice is right over that next hill.
Are you kidding?
We haven't even reached the French border.
Eww Hi.
Oh, boy, I'm exhausted.
Me, too, I'm beat.
I'm just one big charley horse.
Yeah.
For even thinking of coming over here by bicycle, I should have my head examined.
My trouble is in an entirely different spot.
Come on, let's push on.
Push on?
Oh, honey, I'm too tired.
Besides, it's getting late.
Yeah, that's right.
Don't you think we ought to find a someplace to spend the night?
Hey, Rick, there's a farmer.
Yeah, maybe he can put us up for the night.
Yeah.
Uh, signor?
Ah, salve, signori, volete qualche cosa?
Do you speak English?
Huh?
English.
You speak it?
Non capisco.
Ethel, use your italian.
Oh.
Uh Buona sera.
Uh, buona sera.
Parla italiano benissimo, signora.
Benvenuta nella mia povera cascina posso dare qualche cosa per voi?
Voi siete americani, vero?
A noi fa piacere di avere degli americani fra di noi.
Yeah.
What'd he say?
What'd he say?
I don't even know what I said.
How are we gonna ask him to put us up for the night if we can't talk to him?
I know, I'll use sign language.
Anybody can understand that.
All right.
Um, uh uh, signor Si.
Um uh Uh, let's see now, we want two rooms in your house overnight, huh?
Um uh, we wa uh, two rooms in your house overnight.
We want two Due.
Due.
Due, due.
That's right.
Um, uh we want two rooms.
Second word.
Uh, uh, uh Due.
Due, due.
Uh uh we want two Room, room!
That's right!
Not you, Fred.
Look, I'll act out the whole thing.
Give me room.
Room?
Yeah.
All right.
Um Watch me.
Um uh Eh, ho capito.
Volete dormire qui.
Venite con me.
We made contact.
Good work.
Venite arrangiar come datevi.
Queste stanze non sopravanzano ma e meglio che fuori all'aperto.
Eccola, vedete uno e due.
Uh-oh.
I guess he didn't understand me as well as I thought.
I'll try again.
You've done enough already, Marcel Marceau.
Now, just wait a minute.
Look, how about your house?
Uh, your house.
Uh, your-your house.
Uh, casa.
Ah, casa mia.
Yeah, casa you-a.
No, no, signora, in casa mia ci sono molti bambini molti bambini, Teresa Sofia, Luigia, Pietro, Dino e Gino, Rosa, Mario e Antonio- molti bambini.
Nine children- no wonder there's no room in the house.
I'm surprised there's room in the barn.
Allora, buona notte e buon sonno.
Vi svegliero presto domani mattina, arrivederci.
All right.
Grazie.
Grazie.
Yeah.
Grazie.
Well, at least we're not gonna be lonely.
What do we do now?
It's either stay here or get back on the bicycles.
What do you say, honeybunch, should we turn in?
Why not?
Well, don't just stand there- grab a pitchfork and make up our bed.
Oh  Oh, Ricky, honey.
Aw, cut it out.
Oh, oh.
Get away.
Get away.
Oh.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Oh, hi.
How did you sleep?
Oh, pretty good, but when I woke up, there was an old goat next to me.
So what, it happens to me every morning of my life.
Hey, you want to see something funny?
Come and take a look at my cute old goat.
Ah, Fred!
Hey!
How about that for room service?
Ha, Brownie thank you, Brownie.
Speaking of room service, I'm hungry.
Buon giorno, buon giorno.
Oh, oh!
Vi ho portato la colazione.
Oh, isn't that nice?
How about that?
Oh, smell that.
Oh!
Buon appetito.
Una minute, una minute.
How about something to drink?
Cosa?
Drink, drink.
O, ma certo, signora, certo.
Vi serva, vi serva.
Milk, how about that?
Well, thank you very much.
Grazie, grazie.
Prego, prego.
Grazie.
Grazie.
Well, Ricky, go ahead, milk the cow.
Not me.
Why not?
You said you were raised on a farm in Cuba.
I was, but you don't milk cigars.
What are you laughing at?
Get to it.
Oh, no, honey, I'm a city girl.
Fred?
I pass.
Well, maybe we can get some water anyway.
Let's go out and see if we can find some water.
Oh, yeah, there must be a well or a spring or something.
Yes, we'll find one.
Hmm boy.
Good morning, madam.
Morning.
How now, brown cow?
Hey, how about giving me a quart or a pint?
Well, make it easy on yourself, a half-pint, huh?
You're not even trying.
Signora Huh?
Che cosa sta facendo?
Guardi, faccia cosi.
Prenda questo secchio.
Questo e pulito, sa?
Si siedi qua.
Elimina questa cosa qui.
Lo mette fra le gambe oppure lo mette cosi in terra e poi munge.
Oh!
They don't give it, you have to take it.
No so che cosa dice ma faccia in questa maniera.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, uh, thank you.
Prego.
Th-Thank you.
Ibbidy bibbidy cibbidy sab.
My mother told me to take you.
Hey, watch that.
Well, what do you know?
Ha, ha, ha!
Yeah, boy.
Look out now.
Put that foot down.
Put that foot down.
That a boy!
Ya, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hey, look at Lucy.
Lucy!
Don't tell me you know how to milk a cow all the time.
Sure.
Doesn't everybody?
Want a drink?
Au revoir.
Boy, we finally made it to the French border.
And I thought we'd never make it.
Oh, Rick, can't we rest a little while?
No, let's keep going.
We'll never get to Nice.
Come on.
Where you going?
I just want to say good-bye to Italy.
I sure hate to leave.
Well, hurry up.
Farewell, Italy, with your beautiful mountains and your lakes and your wonderful people.
Good-bye, dear Italy.
No, I'm not going to say good-bye.
I'm going to say arrivederci!
Hurry up.
I'm coming.
Good-bye, paisan.
He doesn't want to shake hands; he wants to see your passport.
Oh, my passport.
I'm sorry.
Honey, haven't you got my passport?
Look, Lucy, this is no time for jokes.
I'm not joking.
Well, where is it?
I told you to keep it in a safe place.
Oh, my gosh.
What's the matter?
It's in my blue purse.
Well, where's your purse?
Oh, my gosh.
What now?
Well?
It's in that trunk that was sent ahead to Nice.
What?
!
How did you expect to leave Italy and come into France without a passport?
Oh, now, honey, he knows I'm with you.
Look, I I-I don't have my passport right now, but I'm with them, and they'll vouch for me.
No, no, I'm sorry.
You cannot cross the border without a passport.
Now, look, I-I just told you I have a passport, but I just haven't got it with me.
Now, look, you let me go through and I'll get it and bring it back to you.
I happen to have it in a purse that's sent ahead in a trunk to Nice.
No, no, signora, you cannot go through without a passport.
Ricky, do something!
Look, if we promise you that we'll bring her passport back.
can she go through with us?
Mmm mm-hmm, I'm sorry.
All right, all right, now, don't cry.
Now, don't cry, honey.
Look, there's only one thing to do: I'll go to Nice and get your passport and bring it back.
Oh, honey, would you, please?
Yes, I will.
Come on, Fred.
Oh, thank you.
Go with me.
We'll go on the tandem.
We'll make better time.
I'll stay and keep you company.
Thank you, Ethel.
We'll leave these knapsacks here.
Okay, I'll keep my eye on them.
I'm awfully sorry, honey.
It's all right, okay.
Now, Fred, you pedal!
Be sure and pedal.
Thank you, honey.
All right.
Hurry back.
Bye.
You saw my passport.
My husband's got it.
I just want to go over there and sit with my friend for a while.
I must have your passport, ma'am.
I haven't got it.
Then you cannot go over.
Well, anyway, it's nice to know I have a friend right in the next country.
I wonder what's keeping them.
I don't know.
Pronto, confine italiano, si.
Con chi parlo?
Ho capito, si, si.
Signora, for you.
Oh, it must be Ricky.
Hello.
Was the trunk there, honey?
Yeah, the trunk is here.
Did you find my purse?
No, I didn't.
Why didn't you?
Because I can't find the key to open the trunk with.
Where is the key?
It's in my blue jacket.
Where is your blue jacket?
It's, uh Oh, my gosh.
What's the matter now?
I'm wearing it.
Mira que tiene cosa a decirle mandando uno para venir aca a buscar Honey, honey, here it is.
I found the key.
I found it, honey.
Now, look, look, why don't you bring the trunk out here and unlock it?
I'm not gonna take this trunk for a Well, what do you want to do?
Just leave me here and forget about me?
Well Oh, now!
All right, all right, send Ethel over here with the keys.
All right, I will, honey.
Bye.
Ethel, you take this key to Ricky right away.
Ride all that way by myself?
Well, you're going to have to ride there anyway.
Come on, now, be a good scout.
Go ahead.
Oh  Pronto, confine italiano.
Si, va bene, ho capito, subito.
Signora, for you.
What now?
Hello?
Hello.
Hi, honey, did Ethel get there?
Did you find my purse?
Yeah, yeah, Ethel, Ethel got here and, uh, she brought the key and we opened the trunk and we found your purse.
Now I have a question to ask you.
What?
Where is your passport?
Well, honey, it must be in the purse.
I distinctly remember when we left Rome to go to San Remo, I knew I wouldn't need it, so I put it in my blue purse and locked it in the trunk.
Oh, wait.
Yesterday when we left San Remo, I remember thinking to myself: "Lucy," I thought to myself, "you're going to need that passport when you cross the border.
" So I Oh, my gosh!
What is "Oh, my gosh" for now?
I put it in my knapsack.
It's been right here all the time.
What?
!
I got the knapsack right here, so the three of you go ahead and have a good time and-and I'll get there just as fast as my little old legs can pump a bicycle.
Good-bye, honey.
Silly me.
You're never gonna believe this.
You know, my passport, I thought was in the trunk in Nice?
Well, it wasn't there at all.
It was right over there in my knapsack, so I'll just go get it and give it to you.
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry, signora.
You can't go through without a passport.
Mamma mia, I just told you it's over there in my knapsack.
Let me go through and I'll get it.
No, no, no, no, no, mi dispiace.
You cannot go through unless you show me your passport.
Well, how can I show you my passport if you won't let me go through to get it?
Well, I'm sorry, regulation.
Regulations, smegulations!
All right, it's in my knapsack.
You go get it.
Signora, those knapsacks have been cleared out of Italy and into France and they can only be brought out of France back in Italy by the owner.
But I am the owner!
Can you prove it?
Of course!
What do you want me to do to prove it?
Show me your passport.
Mamma mia!
May I use your phone?
Ma, si, si, si.
Thank you very much.
Regulations.
Sheesh!
Operator, I'd like the Plaza Hotel in Nice, France.
Buona fortuna.
Operator, I'd like to speak to Monsieur Ricky Ricardo, please.
Buona fortuna.
What?
There's no answer.
Well, I Please give him this message: Help!
Thank you.
No, no name.
He'll know who it's from.
Buona fortuna.
Va adagio, adagio, eh?
Oh, honey, am I glad to see you!
He wouldn't let me go over and get my passport unless I had a passport, and I, and I couldn't get my passport unless he let me go through to get it.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Oh, boy, gee, thanks.
Thanks, honey.
Va bene.
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, hooray, I made it!
Thank you.
Ah, give it to me.
I'll know where it is.
Oh.
Oh, honey, aren't you gonna to ball me out or anything?
Do something to me, please.
No, no, I'm afraid to get mad.
I'm afraid to get mad for what might happen if I get mad.
But the next time that you get into trouble Oh, I won't, sir.
You can trust me, sir.
I'll never get in trouble again, sir.
If I do, you'll be the last to hear about it.
Come on.
Okay.
Get your bicycle.
Oh.
Hurry up!
Your passport, madame.
Well, you remember me.
I I just crossed the border.
I just came back to get my bicyc My, but you've changed.
Where's the guard that was just here?
He just left.
I came on duty now.
Oh, but he knows all about me.
You see I had a little Well my passport was We Oh, it was a mess.
It was a mess.
When will he be back?
Tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow morning?
!
Ricky!
Ricky, help!
Help, Ricky!
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Honey, it's time to get down for the dinner show.
Ricky?
Ricky, do you mind if I don't go to your show tonight?
Don't go?
Uh, yeah.
The show is wonderful and I just love the numbers you do, but, you know, after seeing it so many times, it does get a little boring.
Do you mind if I don't go tonight?
Ethel and I?
No, of course not, honey.
Why should I mind?
Good.
I-I thought we might go to a movie.
Sure.
That's a good idea.
Go out, have a little dinner, then go to a movie, and what do you mean my show is boring?
Oh, well, honey, I didn't mean it was really boring, but, you know, after seeing it so many times, it Well, after 20 or 30 times it does get a little Yes?
Well, let's put it this way: Your show is so great, I just can't stand the excitement of seeing it one more time.
That's better.
Oh.
That's better?
Hi, Rick.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
We'd better get down for the dinner show, Rick.
Yeah, okay, I'll be right with you, Fred.
Hey, Ethel, Ethel, how would you like to have dinner and go to a movie with me tonight?
Oh, I'd love to, but how did you get us out of the, uh, s-h-o-w?
Oh, Ethel, he can't pronounce English, but he can spell it.
You're darn tootin' I can.
That's one thing I know how to do is how to s-p-e-I.
Oh.
How do you like that?
All these years I could have been spelling in front of him.
I'll get my things.
Hey, Rick, there's something I want to Well, I'd better tell you.
Yeah, what is it, Fred?
Well, I was going over the books and, uh Well, you know that money isn't everything.
And you also know that, uh, anyone can make a mistake.
Well, wha-wha-what's going on?
You remember how I told you back in Rome that we'd cleared $3,000.
Yeah?
Well, I checked the figures again, and, uh when I jiggled the paper, uh for what I thought were decimal points fell off.
Must've been dirt or something.
So, we, uh, didn't make quite $3,000.
Well, how much did we make?
$300.
$300?
!
Fred, when I hire a band manager, I hire somebody to handle things, not to louse them up.
Well, I'm sorry, Rick, but these things just happen.
Well, there's been too many of these dumb things just happening.
I might as just as well had Lucy for a band manager.
Well, you don't have to get nasty.
What do you mean?
What do you mean you might just as well have had Lucy for a band And what do you mean," "You don't have to get nasty"?
Never mind.
What's going on?
Three guesses who goofed.
What did I do?
!
Not you- Fred, the boy wonder of Wall Street.
Oh.
Well, look, we'll have to go over the books tomorrow and see exactly where we stand.
Come on or we'll be late for the show.
Okay.
I'll go get my coat.
Hey, I got a wonderful idea.
Let's you and I go to the Monte Carlo Casino tonight.
Oh, let's do.
We couldn't leave without seeing the most famous gambling casino in the world.
And who knows, we might be the first Americans who ever broke the bank at Monte Carlo.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
You're not going to broke no bank nowhere.
Why not?
Because I don't want you to go to the casino.
Why not?
Because I don't want you to gamble.
Oh, honey, just a few dollars.
I might win.
That would be worse.
Like my father used to say: "El dinero que se gana jugando no tiene ningun bien.
"Y si te encuentro jugando, no puedes sentar por una semana.
Well!
What does that mean?
It means, "Ill-gotten gold is no one's gain.
"And furthermore, my son, if I catch you gambling, you won't be able to sit down for a week.
" All right, so I won't gamble.
I just want to see what the casino looks like.
Ah, no, no, no, no.
Once you get in there, the temptation is irresistible.
Oh, how do you know?
I know.
My father took me to Havana once.
So?
So I couldn't sit down for a week.
Remember, no casino.
Why don't you just lock me in my room for the night?
Oh, no, honey, don't be silly.
You can go and have dinner anywhere you want, and then go see a movie.
And you stay out of that casino, too, Ethel.
Oh, with the money you give me, you don't have to worry.
It's not that; I'm afraid you might meet up with some prince and sweep him off his feet.
Well, I could.
I might, I might.
: Well, good luck.
Dinner and a movie, big deal.
Well, so we can't gamble.
We can at least eat.
Where'll we go?
Well, let's see, restaurants, restaurants Hey.
You know where we're dining tonight?
Where?
At a very famous Monte Carlo restaurant called "Le Grille.
" Is it near the casino?
It's in the casino.
Lucy, we can't do that.
Why not?
They said we could eat at anyplace we wanted to, didn't they?
Yeah, but they also said we couldn't go to the casino.
Oh, well, Ethel, if you're gonna split hairs Well, I'd rather split hairs than have the boys split our skulls.
Look at it this way: How many times in your life are you going to be in Monte Carlo?
Well, I don't know, but Is it our fault the best restaurant is in the casino?
Well, we don't have to go to that restaurant.
We do if we want to see the casino.
In the face of such logic, how can I refuse?
Oh, Ethel, isn't it exciting?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Le-let's get out of here.
Now, now, we are, we are, we're on our way out.
We're just strolling slowly through the casino to help digest our food, you know.
Les des sont a vous, madame.
Huh?
It is your dice, madame.
Oh, uh, uh, j'ai do not play-ay.
Oh, look.
Ooh, a chip, huh?
Uh Pardon me, sir, is this your chip?
Uh, this must be your chip, then, sir.
No, no, madame.
No?
Il n'y en a plus.
Merci.
Madame, madame.
Madame!
Number 26 has won.
What?
Number 26 has won.
So?
Your number has won.
My number won?
Yes.
Look, all this is yours.
Oh, well, that there's been a mistake.
See, I put the chip on the table, but it wasn't really my chip in the first place.
I- I threw it on a number, but I didn't mean to.
This isn't my money.
Look, this isn't my money, sir.
The whole stack on number 18, madame?
Oh, fine, 18, I don't care.
Nombre dix-huit, 18.
You have won again.
Pardon me.
What is your system, madame?
System?
I don't have any system.
I don't know anything about the game.
Madame, madame, your money.
It is not my money, no, sir.
Pardon, madame.
It is your money.
I saw you placing the bet with my own eyes.
Now, now, look.
Wait just a minute, mister.
I Oh, Ethel.
Uh, you saw her put the bet on the table, but that chip didn't belong to her.
The first chip, it was not mine.
Oh, very well.
Voila, this is for the house.
The rest is yours.
Pardon, madame, do you wish to place another bet?
Now, look, look.
Try to get this through your head.
I- I-I wash my hands of those chips.
But, madame As far as I'm concerned, they can stay right where they are, I don't care.
Oh, then you like to try it on the number 18?
Fine, fine.
Ethel, this is terrible.
What are they doing to me?
Oh, let's just get out of here, huh?
Pardon, pardon, pa-pa-pardon, madame.
Uh, does madame wish to continue with the game?
I was never in the game.
Oh, you do not wish to place another bet?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Oh, wait, madame, then please follow me to the cashier.
The cashier?
Ja.
you just won 875,000 francs.
Look, I-I just couldn't care less.
All I was doing was just walking through the casino.
I put- 875,000 francs!
Oui, madame.
Ethel!
Ethel, come on!
Fred?
Freddie?
Come on in.
We're safe.
He must have stayed for the late show.
Oh, Ethel, what are we gonna do with this?
Oh, Lucy, we've got to do something.
We can't hide it in my room.
If Ricky finds it, he'll kill me.
Even after he finds out how much you won?
Oh, honey, that would be worse.
He'd be a rich widower.
Let me hide it in here until I can at least think of some way to to tell him without admitting that I went to the casino.
Well, all right.
Where'll we put it?
How about under the mattress?
Oh, no, it'd get mixed up with Fred's money.
I know, I know.
I've got it.
Right in here with my good lingerie.
There's lots of room.
I haven't much good lingerie.
Here.
Put it under there.
It'll be safe there.
Gee, French money is big, isn't it?
Oh, I never knew it was that big.
Who would imagine a thing like this happening?
Come on now.
It's all right.
Winning all that money.
Ethel, how am I gonna explain all that money?
This is probably the toughest assignment I've ever had.
Well, maybe something will come to you in the night.
Gee, I hope so.
Don't tell Fred.
Flannelmouth Freddie?
I should say not.
Okay, and thanks a lot, Ethel.
Well, good night.
'Night.
Hi.
Hi.
Is Fred here?
No, he's down in the barbershop.
Oh, I'll call him.
Barbershop, please.
Is Lucy in her room?
No.
I think she's down in the lobby.
Oh, well, maybe I'll run into her.
So long, Rick.
Bye.
Monsieur Mertz, please.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Fred, this is Ricky.
I'm up in your room.
I came over to go over the books, you know.
I'll be right up.
As long as you're there, why don't you get started on the books?
All right.
Where are they?
They're in my suitcase in the closet.
Okay.
Hi, Rick.
Hi, Fred.
I'm sorry, I Hey, you got hold of the wrong suitcase.
I'll say I did.
That's full of Ethel's unmentionables.
There's a few of yours in here, too.
What do you mean?
Look, Fred we've been friends for a long time.
Well?
I- I-I know there's a logical explanation.
Don't you have something to tell me?
Well, no, I don't think so.
All right, Fred, if that's the way you want to handle it.
Open the suitcase and explain what's in it.
Well, what are you talking about?
Just open the suitcase and explain what's in it.
Well, all right.
This is Ethel's girdle.
This is what I mean.
Holy smoke!
Where did that bundle of cabbage come from?
That's what I'd like to know.
Huh?
What's the story?
What's what story?
Now, look, Fred Yeah?
Yesterday, you told me that you made a mistake in bookkeeping in Rome.
Uh-huh.
That we hadn't made $3,000, that we've only made $300.
That we were short $2,700.
And today I find a suitcase full of money in your closet.
Are you trying to tell me you think I've been juggling the books?
Fred, I am trying to find out a logical explanation.
Now, after all, you you have almost a million francs in this suitcase, and you say you don't know where it comes from, huh!
Well, in the first place, it isn't my suitcase, it's Ethel's.
Please, now, don't be a cad and pin it on your wife!
Now, where did this money come from?
I tell you, I don't know!
Now, Fred, I am afraid I have caught you red-handed.
You have not caught me red-handed, you Cuban mush-mouth.
Fred I am trying to be fair.
Don't make me lose my temper.
Oh, go ahead and lose it.
I've already lost mine.
Now, put up your dukes!
Fred Go on, put 'em up.
I'm gonna thrash you within an inch of your life.
Fred, I am not gonna get into a fight with you.
Oh, yes, you are.
You've sullied the name of Mertz.
Now, come on.
Fred.
Fred!
Fred!
Es una cosa horrible que paso!
No lo puedo creer!
No lo puedo creer!
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
It's not you.
This time it's Fred.
Oh.
Fred Mertz.
You know what he's been doing?
What?
He's been juggling the books.
Fred Mertz is an embezzler.
Not our Fred Mertz.
Yes, our Fred Mertz.
Oh, honey, that that can't be true.
You must be mistaken.
No, no, no, I'm not mistaken.
Accidentally I found a suitcase full of money in his closet.
And he says he has no idea where that money came from.
Huh!
Oh, uh Uh, Ricky, that isn't Fred's money in Ethel's suitcase.
What do you mean it isn't Fred's How did you know it was Ethel's suitcase?
Oh uh, how did I know it was Ethel's suitcase?
Yeah?
Was Ethel there?
No.
Well, then, uh she told me it was her money.
Where did Ethel get all that money?
Her aunt died and left it to her.
Her aunt left her French money?
Oh.
It was her French aunt.
That's good.
I mean, that's right.
Her French aunt, her aunt Yvette.
Yeah, Yvette.
Are you telling me the truth?
If I'm not, may I drop dead.
Why didn't Fred say something about it?
He didn't know.
He didn't know?
No, no, you know how tight Fred is.
Uh, Ethel didn't want that old rooster to know about her nest egg.
Boy, if if what you're saying is right, I certainly owe Fred Mertz an apology.
Yeah, well  There it is, Ricardo.
My resignation.
Effective immediately.
Immediately after you pay our transportation back to the States, plus two weeks severance pay.
Now, Fred Fred.
I- I'm afraid I owe you an apology.
I just found out that that money belongs to Ethel.
Ethel who?
Ethel Mertz.
My Ethel Mertz?
Yes.
Her aunt died and left her the money.
What aunt?
A A French aunt that you don't know about.
That's right, Fred.
Do you mean my little honeybun is loaded?
Yeah.
Gee, Fred, I'm, I'm I'm sorry I thought you were a crook.
That's all right, Rick, what are friends for?
Listen, we'll tear this up, huh?
All right.
Fred Fred, uh, don't tell Ethel you know.
Let her tell you in her own way, huh?
Yeah, that-that'd be better, Fred.
Sure, sure.
Don't say that we told you.
I know what you mean.
Oh, there you are!
It was so hot out, I had to come right back.
I've never seen, uh, uh What are you looking so funny about?
Hello, there, you little dickens, you!
What's the matter with you?
Sweetheart, it just dawned on me what a fascinating creature you are.
The heat's got him.
No, no, no, don't be silly.
It's you, you doll.
Why, when you walked into this room, if we weren't already married, I'd have asked you for a date.
Come on, honey, let's try and go someplace where we can be alone.
Come on, darling, come on.
Let's try and be alone for a minute.
Come on, I'll sit here.
You sit in my lap.
Come on, sweetie pie.
Now, now, put your arm around me.
There.
Fred, are you sure you're all right?
I never felt better in my life, lover.
Oh, then you meant all those things you said in there?
'Course I did.
Oh, you are cute.
Hello.
Hello.
Ethel, it's me.
Uh, call back later, dear.
Now, where were we?
Oh Hello?
Ethel, listen to me now.
Ricky's going downstairs.
It's my only chance to talk to you.
Ricky found all that money in your suitcase and thought Fred had been juggling the books, so I told him it was your money.
What'd you do that for?
Well, I didn't want him to think Fred was an embezzler and I didn't want him to find out I'd been gambling and you were the only one left.
I ran out of people.
Well, you've run out of friends, too.
That's the dirtiest trick you've ever played on me!
I never want to see you again!
Oh, but now Who was that, snookums?
Aah, you let me up.
No, now, tootsie I just found out why you're tootsieing me.
It's on account of that money in my suitcase.
Money?
That money had nothing to do with my deep devotion for you.
Well, it's a good thing it didn't because it isn't mine, it's Lucy's.
Lucy's?
!
She won it last night gambling at the casino.
What are you trying to pull?
I'm not trying to pull anything.
It was Lucy's half-baked idea.
Ethel, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
You're sorry?
How do you think I feel?
Lucy, you and I are through.
Oh, now, Ethel, listen And don't you say anything, you golddigger.
Don't you call me a gold digger, you pauper!
Oh, now, Ricky was right.
Ill-gotten gold is nobody's gain.
Look at us, at each other's throats just because of that dirty money.
This dirty old money!
Lucy, what are you gonna do?
Lucy!
Where are you gonna go?
I'm going back to the casino and get rid of this ill-gotten gold!
Now, what's the matter with you?
Wiped out twice in one lifetime.
What do you mean?
The crash of '29 and now this.
Fred!
Hi.
What's the matter?
What's going on?
What's the matter with Fred?
He just found out I'm not Bobo Rockefeller.
What are you talking about?
The money in that suitcase isn't mine, it's Lucy's.
Oh.
Lucy's!
Yeah, she won it gambling last night at the casino.
I told her not to gamble!
Oh, now, put your eyes back in their sockets.
She only gambled by accident.
By accident?
Oh, come now, there was almost a million francs in that suitcase.
You can think of a better story than that.
Oh, now, Ricky, it's the truth.
It's the truth.
She found a chip on the floor and she threw it on the table to give it back and it won.
She kept pushing the chips, just kept pushing them away from her and she pushed her way into a fortune.
Oh.
Now, Rick, she kept her promise, honest she did.
We just happened to eat in a restaurant that was in the casino.
You told her she could eat anyplace she wanted to.
Ricky, please don't be angry.
I'm not angry.
You're not?
I think it's wonderful.
You do?
Gee, Lucy thought you'd be furious.
Of course not, it wasn't her fault.
No, it wasn't.
Not her fault.
No.
Where is she?
She's gone to the casino to give back the money!
Oh, no!
Yeah.
There, and I never want to see it again.
One moment, madame.
You don't know, you don't know what has happened to me with that money.
I- I put one chip on this table yesterday and-and it and it money like that that I don't Here are your chips, madame.
I do not want the chips, I wash my hands.
Vingt-cinq.
25.
Wait, madame, you have won again.
That is impossible because I did not put my chips on any number.
I know, madame, but you had them on red.
And 25 is red.
Oh, no.
Lucy!
Ricky, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it Look, look, honey, Ethel explained everything to me, and I think it's wonderful.
You mean I can keep it?
Sure.
Where's the money?
Right there.
Oh, no!
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Lucy, have you got room for this stuff in your trunk?
I was just coming down to ask you the same thing.
Ethel, I told you, you were buying too many souvenirs.
Well, now, I want a lot of things to remind me of my trip when I get home.
Gee, I hate to leave Europe.
Me, too.
From the looks of things, you're not leaving it.
You're taking it with you.
Oh, Fred, you can't come home from Europe without buying gifts for your friends.
The test of true friendship does not depend upon buying gifts.
He ought to know- he's been testing his friends for 20 years.
Look at all this junk you're lugging home.
This is not junk, Fred, believe me.
Hi, Rick.
Come here.
Hi, Ricky.
Hi, honey.
Hi, dear.
Listen, I stopped by American 'Spress and I gave them our forwarding address in New York.
Hey, did they have any mail Good.
for us at American 'Spress?
Oh, yes, I almost forgot.
Here.
Oh, a letter from Mother!
Gee, it'll be wonderful to see Mother and Little Ricky again, won't it, honey?
Yeah, it'll be wonderful to see Little Ricky again all right.
Here's a telegram for you.
How do you like that?
A telegram and she forwards it in the regular mail.
It takes three weeks to get here.
Only your mother would Oh, now, honey, maybe it isn't important.
It's probably a birthday greeting or something.
I hope you're right.
Oh, no!
lay, que barbaridad!
Mira, es el telegram importante que estaba esperando.
What's it say?
Oh, no!
Lo estoy esperando por tres meses el telegram  What's it say?
Well, whatever it is, I have a feeling it isn't "happy birthday.
" Your mother is a a Honey, is it important?
Oh, no, no.
Only the managing director of the Roxy Theater in New York, and he wants me to open there with my band for two weeks, starting next Monday!
That's all.
Oh We'll make it if fly.
That's a good idea.
I'll call him and find out if the offer still stands.
All right.
Hello, operator.
Operator, I want to put a call to New York City, please.
Mr. Rothefel at the Roxy Theater in New York City.
As soon as you can.
It's very important.
Listen, Fred, would you see if you can get a reservation on Pan American for us and the orchestra?
Sure I will.
Hey, this is exciting.
We're gonna fly across the ocean.
Who said you were going to?
What do you mean?
I may leave you right here in Europe.
I didn't do anything.
Your mother did, and she inherits it from you.
Oh!
Hello.
Yes?
Yes.
Mr. Rothefel?
This is Ricky Ricardo.
Ye-Yes, sir.
I'm still I'm still in Europe.
I got your wire.
Well, I just got it today.
Well, I-I know when it was sent, but it went to my personal dead letter office.
Oh, push tush.
Well, it doesn't matter.
Look, I just wanted to find out: Does the offer stand?
Wonderful.
Yeah, well, I'm just trying to find out if I can fly.
Yeah, you'll make it, Peter Pan.
I'll let you know Oh, hold it a minute.
Hey, it's all set, Rick.
There's a clipper leaving tomorrow afternoon, arriving New York the following day.
Wonderful.
Listen, it's all right.
We-we're gonna be able to fly and we'll be there in plenty of time.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Good-bye.
Good.
Now listen.
Wait a minute.
You'd better call the steamship lines and tell them that we have to go by plane.
All right.
You see, everything's all right.
Mother didn't make such a bad mistake after all.
Hey, Rick, I'm just thinking.
The band was going home free for playing on the boat.
This way, you'll have to buy plane tickets for all of us.
Oh, who asked you?
Thanks to your mother, I have to play the Roxy for two weeks for nothing.
All right, forget about the Roxy.
Let's go home on the boat like we planned.
Oh, no.
No, no.
I've been waiting to play the Roxy for a long time, and I'm gonna play the Roxy.
Oh, ho!
You see?
It isn't my mother's fault at all.
It's just your neurotic need to be in the spotlight.
My neurotic need to be in the spotlight?
Yeah.
How do you like them apples?
And close your mouth.
What apples?
I hope that's a big plane we're going home on.
Got to have plenty of room for all this stuff.
Oh, no, you dunt.
What "dunt" I "dunt"?
You don't take this junk on the plane.
That's what you don't dunt.
Why not?
Look, they only allow you 66 pounds, and every pound over 66 costs you two dollars.
Two dollars a pound?
That's right.
Everything over 66 pounds has to go by boat.
: Well, all right.
Let's see.
Oh, dear, now, I've got to take these wooden shoes to Marian Van Black.
And I got to take this bottle of My Sin to Mrs. Trumbull, I promised her.
Oh, here's something you can ship.
That probably weighs all of two ounces.
Well, I don't care.
These other things are very important.
Look, Lucy, make up your mind, that everything goes by boat except your luggage and your clothes.
That alone will weigh 66 pounds.
All right, but there's one thing I have to take with me for sure- that cheese.
That cheese?
Yes.
Now, don't argue with me.
You can't get that kind of cheese at home.
Are you kidding?
This thing must weigh 66 pounds by itself.
No, it's only 25 pounds.
That's a very rare kind of Italian cheese and I promised to bring it home for a very special person.
And who is this very special person?
Someone we all know and love- my mother.
Your what?
!
My mother, and she's a who, not a what.
Now, look, Lucy, your mother has already cost me a fortune.
And I'm not going to spend one more penny on that big hunk of cheese.
How can we get off that plane and not have a present for mother?
After all, she stayed with the baby all the time we were gone.
For the money she's cost me, I could have hired Dr. Spock.
Oh Now, look, I don't want to hear another argument about it.
I'm not going to spend one more penny for this cheese even to ship it.
Now, come on, Fred.
We've got a lot of things to do.
Okay.
Boy, there's going to be some family argument if I get off that plane without a present for my mother.
How can I get that cheese to New York?
You can't.
Oh, yes, I can, now.
Ricky won't pay for taking it What do, what do they take on the plane for free?
Only the clothes you're wearing.
Oh, well, that's no good.
Very few people wear cheese.
Try to think of something else besides clothes.
You thinking?
Y- Yes.
I'm, I'm thinking.
Yeah, I'm thinking.
Do they charge for babies on planes?
I don't think so.
Why?
Oh, no.
Lucy, oh, no, Lucy.
Isn't that cute?
Yeah.
Gee, that'll come in handy, won't it?
Hi.
Hi, boys.
Hi, Rick.
Where's Lucy?
Oh, uh, uh, she stopped to get a magazine.
She'll be here in a minute.
How much time do we have?
We take off in five minutes.
Thank you.
If Lucy misses this plane Now, Rick, she'll make it.
Five will get you ten.
Don't worry, Rick.
Sit down.
She'll make it.
Yeah, well Oh, here she comes.
I told you, she'd make it.
What's she What's that?
What's what?
That.
What are you doing?
Oh, Rock-a-bye, baby What have you got there?
Where are you going?
I am not the father of that cheese.
Oh come on, sit down.
Sit down here.
Look Sit down!
I don't want anything to do with you or your little scheme.
I will be sitting in the lounge in the back of the plane.
Oh, Ricky.
Fred.
I thought I'd sit up here with you so we wouldn't disturb the others.
WOMAN : Good afternoon.
All of us are happy to have you aboard this Pan American President flight number 155 to New York.
Fasten your seat belts, please, and observe the "No Smoking" sign.
Thank you.
I'm Evelyn Bigsby.
Oh, I'm, uh How do you do?
I'm Lucy Ricardo.
How do you do?
No, no.
She's a little fussy.
She missed her nap.
Oh.
My, you certainly have a quiet baby.
Good baby.
Yeah, well Is it a girl?
Huh?
Is it a girl?
No.
Oh, a boy.
All right.
Mine's a girl.
Oh.
She's four months old.
Hmm.
How old is yours?
Uh four months.
Oh, big baby.
How much does he weigh?
Too much?
Well, how much did he weigh when he was born?
Uh fif uh Eight pounds.
But he's a big eater.
Well, I think I'll take a nap.
I'm just dying to see him.
What's his name?
Cheddar Uh, Chester.
My daughter's name's Caroline.
Oh, well, that's nice.
Especially for a girl.
Isn't she cute?
Yeah.
May I?
Oh, no, he's he's very shy.
He doesn't like to have strangers look at him.
Do you want the strange lady to see you?
You don't?
Oh, well, don't worry about it.
No.
No, no, it's perfectly all right.
No, I'll just tell her, that's all.
Forget about it.
He said no.
He talks?
Only the last couple of months.
If you ladies will give me the babies' bottles, I'll heat them.
Oh, fine, yes.
Thank you.
There you are.
Wouldn't you like me to warm your baby's bottle?
Oh, well, he isn't hungry yet.
Thank you.
Well, then, let me keep it in the refrigerator it for you.
Oh, okay oh.
Uh I didn't bring any.
You didn't bring any?
You didn't bring any?
Oh, well, I meant to, really.
I- I just forgot.
So, just skip it.
He can have one of mine.
Oh, no, I wouldn't think of it.
Thank you just the same.
I'll, I'll feed him when we get to New York.
But we don't get there until tomorrow.
Oh, well, it will do him good.
He's too fat anyway.
Please heat both bottles, Miss.
Thank you very much.
Oh, hi, dear.
Oh, is that your husband?
Yes.
Oh, pardon me, sir.
Wouldn't you like to sit next to your wife?
I'd be glad to change seats with you.
Yes, come on, dear, sit here.
Not while you have that.
He can't stand children.
Oh, well, that's a shame.
Yes, it is, especially when the baby looks exactly like him.
Here we are.
Oh, good.
Oh, thank you.
You know, this is a wonderful formula.
It's been in the family for years.
Is that so?
Mmm.
Here we go, honey.
Good baby.
Yes, you're a good baby.
Drink it all up.
That's a boy.
Down the hatch.
Now, here we go.
He hates to drink alone.
What's in that formula?
Cod liver oil.
I I think he's had enough.
Thank you very much.
Well he hasn't had any at all.
Oh, no, he's had plenty, really.
He wasn't very hungry.
Burp.
Burp.
Mrs. Ricardo?
Burp.
Yes?
I've been checking my list and there seems to be a mistake.
Oh?
I don't have a record of your baby on our passenger list.
Oh, that.
Well, I didn't mention it because I-I didn't think it mattered as long as babies travel for free.
Oh, but they don't on overseas flights.
Oh.
We do charge, but we charge only ten percent of the regular fare for babies.
Oh.
You can pay for the baby when you get to New York.
: Ethel, wake up.
Ethel, wake up.
Fred, Fred, stop.
Don't pull all the covers.
What's the matter?
Wake up.
Huh, what?
What's the matter?
Complications.
Complications.
What's the matter?
They charge ten percent of the regular fare for babies.
That's $30.
Oh, well, how much will it cost for the cheese?
Fifty dollars.
Well, it's cheaper to have the cheese be a baby than have the baby be a cheese.
That's not the point.
Either way, Ricky will kill me.
But what are you gonna do, honey?
I'll be back.
Where are you going?
Ooh!
I'm going to the kitchen.
Okay.
Ethel, wake up.
What, what?
Move over.
What are we gonna do, Lucy?
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna eat it.
What?
!
We're gonna eat the cheese.
You like cheese, don't you?
Oh, well, not enough to eat all of that.
Oh, come on now.
Oh, Lucy, I couldn't eat 25 pounds of cheese.
I- I polished off a wonderful meal.
I- I ate a-a nice, great, big steak and-and some apricot pie Hey, stop talking and eat.
Here.
Oh, Lucy, this is ridiculous.
Even I can't eat all of this.
Eat what you can.
We'll figure out what to do with the rest later.
Where's your baby?
Huh?
Your baby- where is he?
Oh, that.
: Oh, I didn't have a baby.
What do you mean, you didn't have a baby?
I didn't.
I didn't have a baby.
It was a piece of cheese.
Stewardess!
Mrs. Bigsby Stewardess!
Help!
Mrs. Bigsby What's the matter?
This woman's baby's disappeared and now she claims she never had one.
No, no, no, no, no, no, that's not true.
What's the matter?
I saw your baby.
No, you did not.
I've been with this department a good many years, but I've never seen a case like this.
Now, Mrs. Bigsby claims that Mrs. Ricardo had an object in her arms, and that that object was a baby.
I don't claim; I saw.
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
You have no idea what you saw.
Mrs. Ricardo says it was not a baby.
So far, this is logical.
There's a difference of opinion.
One lady is right, the other's wrong.
Yeah, well.
Mr. Ricardo, a celebrated and seemingly rational man, says that it looked like a baby, but it was in reality a piece of cheese.
That's right.
Yeah.
Now, Mrs. Ricardo, I'm going to ask you once more: Was there a baby?
No, sir.
Then whose is this?
Oh It's mine.
It's the latest thing from Paris.
Now, look, mister, mister the newsreel fellow is there.
He wants to take a picture of me and my orchestra.
Oh, he does?
Yes, sir.
Now, uh, you see, th-they're getting awfully close to the deadline.
Oh, they are?
Well, I thought you'd like to know.
Yeah.
I beg your pardon, sir, but I am positive Mrs. Ricardo was carrying a baby.
Oh, no you're not, you're not positive about a thing.
Ma'am, please.
I saw the baby drinking the milk.
: Wait a minute!
Did you actually see the baby's face?
I most certainly.
Oh, come now.
You couldn't miss It.
It looked just like him.
What do you mean, it looked just like me?
You leave him out of it.
He had nothing to do with it.
It was a baby.
It was a piece of cheese.
Did you ever hear a piece of cheese burp?
Oh Look, let me try to explain this whole thing to you from the beginning.
We were in Nice.
She wanted to bring this cheese to her mother.
All right, now, I had been telling her she had too much luggage already.
So, she thought that babies travel for free.
She took the cheese, she put a blanket around it, put the little bonnet on the cheese and took it in the plane with her.
Well, didn't you think this was rather strange behavior?
For Lucy?
No.
You see, I intended to pay for the cheese the minute I got here.
Oh, you did?
I did.
That's right.
He told me he was.
Sure.
Hey, Rick, we're gonna miss out on those newsreels.
Yeah, get your instruments out You don't mind if they start getting Well, yes, oh, all right, but just one question.
Where is the cheese?
That's a good question.
Where is the cheese, honey?
Uh, where is the cheese?
Yes, where is the cheese?
We ate it.
You and Mrs. Ricardo ate 25 pounds of cheese?
Oh, come now.
Oh, it's possible.
I've seen my wife sit down and polish off a whole Oh, shut up.
Lucy, where is the cheese?
Well?
Well, I'm afraid to tell you.
I am not going to do anything to you.
You promise?
: I am not going to do!
You scared me!
I'm sorry.
Look, I'll be glad to pay for the cheese, honey.
Well, that's not what I'm afraid of.
Well, tell me what it is.
Pardon me, Mr. Ricardo.
Yes, sir.
We've just got two minutes and I've got to get that shot.
All right.
Would you excuse Let me take this, please.
It's very important.
Oh, go ahead.
We're working at the Roxy.
The one that you see Mr. Ricardo, right over here.
You stand right over here in front of the band.
Yes, sir.
I'll ask you if you're glad to be home and you answer by playing "Home Sweet Home.
" Thank you.
Roll it, Vic.
All right, boys, "Home Sweet Home.
Everybody together.
Mr. Ricardo, how does it feel to be back in the United States?
What's the matter?
Oh, no!
CUSTOMS  So that's where you hid the cheese!
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I didn't know it'd get all gooey and everything like that.
You don't know how much trouble it was to get rid of that cheese.
I just had to get that cheese home to my mother, honey.
Oh, all I could think of was to put it in there.
I put it in the trombone- that wasn't bad- but that piccolo I thought I'd never get it in the piccolo.
If you'd only had a tuba in the band, I could've put the whole thing in the tuba.
I'm terribly sorry, honey, but I didn't know what else to do.
It'd have meant a lot to me to take a You're laughing.
I thought you'd be angry.
What are you laughing at?
: It's so ridiculous.
The whole thing is so utterly ridiculous.
It is?
Yeah, I guess so.
It could only happen to you.
Yeah, little old silly me.
You know something, Lucy?
What?
Being married to you is not easy.
No.
But it sure is a lot of fun.
Oh, honey!
Mmm Come on, let's go home and see the baby, huh?
All right, honey.
