{START OF EPISODE 1}
"Lucy and Bob Hope"   Come on now, Little Ricky, let me see you swing that bat.
Attaboy!
Ha-ha!
You're gonna be another Mickey Mantle.
Uncle Fred, who's Mickey Mantle?
Who's Mickey Mantle?
Why, he's the guy they got to replace Joe DiMaggio.
Who's Joe Maggio?
"Who's Joe Maggio"?
You talk more like your father every day.
It's Joe DiMaggio.
And he's one of the greatest Yankees of all time.
Come on now, let me see you take another swipe at that old apple.
Boffo!
Right out of the park.
Attaboy.
Hi, Daddy.
Hey!
Hi!
Hi, Rick.
Say, what's going on, partner?
I'm swiping apples.
You're swiping apples?
He means he's taking a swipe at the old apple.
Oh.
Well, let me see you do it.
Go on.
Show him.
Show your dad.
At 'em!
Hey!
He's gonna be another Joe Maggio.
Yes, sir.
I'm treating the two girls and Little Ricky to the ball game this afternoon at Yankee Stadium.
Well, that's very generous of you, Uncle Fred.
Well, it's nothing, Rick.
I'm glad to do it.
Today is Ladies' Day, Daddy.
Oh, it's Ladies' Day.
Uh-huh.
Ladies and little boys get in free.
"Ladies and little boys get in free.
" Yeah.
He's just like his mother.
Yatata, yatata, yatata, yatata, yatata.
Well, listen, if you're going to go the ball game, with Uncle Fred, you'd better go take a nap, huh?
Okay, Daddy.
You go to sleep now, son.
Good-bye.
Ain't he a dandy?
How about that kid, huh?
He's a dandy.
Listen, did the girls come back from shopping yet?
No, not yet.
And I'm getting hives at the thought of Ethel running loose in a department store with a loaded charge-a-plate.
Well, listen, Fred, you can't expect the girls to go to the opening of a new nightclub in an old dress.
Ah, well, it's all your fault, too.
If you hadn't bought a piece of the Tropicana, I wouldn't be buying a piece of Saks Fifth Avenue.
Listen, you won't recognize the old Tropicana.
Boy, it's all changed.
It's brand-new furniture, brand-new paint job new bandstand, new uniforms We even changed the name.
We call it Club Babalu.
Club Babalu?
Yeah.
Hey, I like that.
And wait till you hear who I got for the opening night.
Who?
Bob Hope.
Bob Hope!
Yeah.
Bob Hope.
His agent Jimmy Safield just called me and said, "It's all set.
" Well, that's terrific.
Yeah, there's only one thing, though.
I made a slip the other day and Lucy knows that I was trying to get Bob Hope for the opening, you know.
How could you pull a boner like that?
You know how she acts in front of celebrities.
I know, but I was talking on the telephone and I didn't know that she was in the apartment, but she doesn't need to know it's all set and that Bob is going to do it.
Understand?
Mm-hmm.
So not a word in front of Lucy and not a word in front of Ethel and not a word in front of Little Ricky.
Now we got him to worry about.
Yeah, fine way to live- surrounded by blabbermouths.
Hi.
Hiya, honey, what you do?
Buy half of the store?
Well, not quite.
Fred, you'd better go give Ethel a hand.
She can't get up the stairs.
She's got so many packages.
Oh, good night, nurse.
If I ever find where she hides that charge-a-plate, I'll pound the letters down.
Fred.
Where is the baby, honey?
He just went in to take a nap.
Oh, good.
Any news about the opening?
News?
Yeah, about the guest star.
Did you get hold of Bob Hope?
Bob Hope?
Yeah.
Did he call you?
Uh no.
No, Bob Hope didn't call.
No.
Well, he certainly knows that you were waiting to hear from him.
He knows the opening is tomorrow night.
Yeah, well, you know, that's show business.
Well, I can't understand why he didn't even call you, for heaven's sake.
: Oh, my goodness!
Oh, I just had a horrible thought.
What?
Ricky, you don't suppose?
Oh, I know it's a wild idea, but you don't suppose that Bob Hope heard about me, and that's the reason he hasn't called you, do you?
About you?
Yeah.
You know, those exaggerated reports about what happens to a celebrity when they meet up with me.
No.
No, as bad as you are, I don't think By George, I hate to say this, but you may be right.
Oh, no!
Yeah, I think you hit it right on top of the head.
I think that-that Bob is afraid even to come near you.
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
Well Oh, I just feel awful.
Well, that's all right, honey.
Oh, this is terrible!
Honey, you're married to a jinx!
Now, now, now, honey Yes, you are.
Here are the lineups and batting orders for today's game: For Cleveland, batting first and playing right field, Al Smith Gee, a baseball game is fun.
Kind of wish I knew what it was all about.
Kill the umpire!
Stop, Ethel!
Stop!
Well, that's what you always say.
Game hasn't even started.
Oh.
Oh, Lucy, come on, cheer up.
There could be a million reasons why Bob Hope hasn't called Ricky.
No, there aren't.
He's heard that every time I come near a celebrity, there's trouble.
It happened in Hollywood.
It happened in Europe.
I'm a scourge of two continents.
Oh, now, honey, that's the silliest thing I ever heard of.
Oh, come on, perk up.
Red hots!
Get your red hots!
Get 'em while they're hot!
Fred, Fred, I'm hungry.
Get me a hot dog.
Did you come out here to watch a ball game or to stuff your face?
That guy down there is eating.
He's not eating.
He's a pitcher.
He's chewing tobacco.
A lot of ball players chew tobacco.
Well, whatever it is, it sure looks good.
Come on, go get me a hot dog.
That man won't be back here for hours.
Oh all right.
Can I have one, Uncle Fred?
Okay, Little Rick.
Okay.
Well, as long as you're up, you might as well bring me one, too, Fred.
I came out here to watch a ball game and I wind up as a short-order cook.
Fred, come on Can I have your autograph, Mr. Hope?
Well, I don't know.
You seen my latest picture, The Iron Petticoat?
Yes, sir!
You watch my television show?
Oh, yes, sir.
You root for Cleveland?
I own a piece of the team, you know.
Yes, sir.
Well, now that you've been properly brainwashed There you are, you lucky boy.
How are you?
How's it going, all right?
Listen, Ethel, you keep an eye on Little Ricky for a minute, will you?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna talk to Bob Hope.
Oh, no, you're not.
No, no, you're not.
Now, listen, now, listen, Ethel, I'm just gonna explain to him that I'm not really a jinx and I'm gonna promise to stay away from him.
and maybe he'll do Ricky's show.
Oh, Lucy.
May I see your ticket, please?
I just want to talk to Bob Hope.
You and everyone else in the Yankee Stadium.
I'm sorry.
But this is important.
I've got to see him.
So see him.
Look from here.
You don't understand.
I'm Ricky Ricardo's wife.
Well, that's keen.
I'm Phoebe Krausfeld's husband, and it's still no dice.
Hot dogs!
Get your hot dogs!
Get 'em while they're hot!
Hot dogs!
Hot dog man.
How many, lady?
Um, I think you and I better have a little talk.
Paul Paul, the uniforms are not here yet.
They're What are they doing to the floor?
!
What's the matter with the floor?
!
Calm down, Rick.
It will be finished today.
And by tomorrow night, it will be all set in and dry.
Now don't panic!
It's my opening.
If I want to panic, I'll panic.
Oh, say, Rick, before I forget, Jimmy Safield called.
Bob Hope's out at the ball game.
He wants you to come out there and look over the material for the opening.
Now, there's a ticket for you at the box office at Yankee Stadium.
Now go on, go on.
Please go.
I got a lot of things to do around here.
Are you sure that floor is gonna get in all right?
It'll be fine.
Now just take it easy.
Just go to the ball game.
Enjoy yourself.

Well, Mr. Hope Uh, right.
Mr. Hope Mr. Hope, I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
Look, I told you I don't want a hot dog.
But Mr. Hope, if I could just talk to you for a second.
Look, you don't get my message.
I don't want a hot dog.
Look upon me as a vegetarian, will you, please?
Please, please, Mr. Hope Will you get this thing out of here?
The steam is taking the curl out of my nose.

Would you pass this over there, please?
Thank you very much.
What I have to talk to you about is very important, Mr. Hope.
Would you give him the change, please?
There you are, sir.
Hey, I'll have one, too.
Oh, uh, yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Here, Mr. Hope, would you pass that, please?
Hey, you forgot my relish.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry.
There you are, sir.

This is mine.
Okay.
Here you are.
Ma'am wants a little mustard.

Fine.
I've Will you put a bun around this finger?
It looks delicious.
Oh, Mr. Hope, I'm sorry.
Yeah, it's all right.
What was that?
What was that?
Oh, nothing.
Somebody just hit the ball over the fence.
Oh, no.
Al Rosen hits a home run and I gotta miss it.
Oh, no!
I'm sorry, Mr. Hope, but if you can just let me talk to you for just a minute.
I'm trying to watch the game.
Will you leave me  What is it?
Mr. Hope, please, I have got to talk to you.
Yeah, but, honey This is important.
It's my tie.
This is very important.
I didn't come to the ball game just to talk to you.
Get your red hots!

This ought to help.
There.
Ooh.
Ah, that's what I've always wanted- a quick-frozen beret.

Mm-hmm.
Mr. Hope Yeah.
there's a Mr. Ricardo outside to see you.
Fine.
Send him in.
Thank you very much.
Hi, Bob.
I heard about the foul ball.
Are you all right?
Yeah, they can't hurt me.
I used to be in vaudeville, you know.
I understand that a hot dog vendor caused the whole thin'.
Pardon?
A hot dog vendor caused the whole thin'.
You're trying to tell me something.
Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
A hot dog vendor.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Some real weirdo kept saying he wanted to talk to me- yatata, yatata, yatata.
A real weirdo that kept going yatata, yatata, yatata?
Mm-hmm.
What did this, uh, hot dog vendor look like?
Oh, tall, red hair.
Uh-oh.
Oh?
What?
It could be my wife.
Are you married to a tall, redheaded weirdo that goes yatata, yatata, yatata?
Yes.
With a mustache?
Oh.
Well, thank goodness, for once it wasn't Lucy.
But if you ever bump into a tall, red-haired weirdo that goes yatata, yatata, yatata and doesn't have a moustache, run for your life.
That's Lucy.
Your wife really like that?
Yes.
You need this more than I do.
Listen, Bob, I wanted to talk to you about that, uh, opening for the club, you know.
You got any ideas what we should do?
Yeah, I've been thinking it over and I think we can do some real How's the game coming?
: Oh, pretty good, but the game isn't over till the last man is out, you know.
Well, hello, Mr. Hope.
Well, good-bye, Mr. Hope.
Oh, uh, uh, sonny?
Who?
Me?
Yeah, you.
Come here.
I want to talk to you.
I don't remember seeing you with the team before.
Uh, no.
I'm a new one.
Well, back to the ol' ball game.
Yeah, oh Wait a minute.
Say, you must be that new rookie we brought up from our farm in Indianapolis.
Uh, yep.
Well, how are things down on the farm?
Well, farm, uh Pigs are all right, but the cow died.
Well, back to the ol' ball game.
Wait!
I understand you have quite a throwing arm.
I'd like to see your pitching motion.
Um, all righty.
What do you pitch?
Bonbons?
Well, uh, I could pitch much better if I had a chaw of tobacco.
All us pitchers chew tobacco, you know.
I'll go get some tobacco and come back and pitch for you later.
Hey, wait a minute, buddy.
Here.
Here's some chewing tobacco right here.
What's the matter?
Not my brand.
Lucy, who you do think you're foolin'?
Oh, you were great.
You were a million laughs.
Could I interest you in a stomach pump?
Look.
Would you please tell me what you are doing?
Well, I was only trying to get Mr. Hope to appear at the club.
I'm sorry you got hit on the head when I tried to sell you a hot dog.
Was that you, too?
I told you.
Yeah.
I didn't recognize you without your moustache.
Yeah, well, now you'll never appear at the club.
I'll be there.
You will?
!
Yes.
I had the whole thin' straightened out with his agent this morning.
This morning?
!
Yes.
Oh Now, look, Bob, we still haven't decided what we're gonna do.
The opening is tomorrow night.
What do you think?
Well, I've got a special-material number about baseball for three people.
We'll need a couple I'll need a couple partners that can sing and dance.
Well, I'm not exactly Gene Kelly, but I'd love to do it.
Oh, that's great.
Who else can we get?
You stay out of this.
I didn't say anything.
You mean the Kiss of Death can sing and dance?
Well, that is a matter of opinion.
Well, it's an easy little number.
She might be cute in it.
How can you say that after all she's done to you?
!
I figure if you can't lick 'em, join 'em.
Nothing doing.
We'll get somebody else.
I'll talk to you later.
: Well, back to the ol' ball game.
I forgot my  Oh, what's wrong, Lucy?
Oh, nothing.
Aw, now, it can't be that bad.
What's the problem?
Well, I really did want to do that act with you, Mr. Hope.
All my life I've wanted to be in show business, and doing an act with you would be the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Well, why don't you do it, then?
Because Ricky won't let me.
He says I'm a jinx.
Aw, no, now, come, come.
Ballplayers never cry.
I'm sorry I got mustard on you and I'm sorry I made you get hit on the head.
It's all right.
Anytime at all.
And I'm sorry I hit you on the back and made you swallow your tobacco.
Oh, that's all right.
You got a lump on the head and I got a lump in my stomach.
That's a funny joke.
It is?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You know, I sing and dance even better than I tell jokes.
No!
Yes.
Then why doesn't Ricky let you go into show business?
I don't know.
It's just professional jealousy, I guess.
Oh, you poor thing.
And you know, Mr. Hope, I'm only trying to help him.
I'm only trying to be a good wife.
That's all.
I can sing and I can dance.
I can do a lot of things.
You have no idea how talented I am.
May I?
Where'd you go?
I turn around and you were gone.
Don't speak to me, you Cuban heel.
Wha' happen'?
Wha' happen'?
I'll tell you wha' happen'.
This dear little girl wants to get into our act and you won't let her.
All her life she's tried to get into show business and you've held her back.
Yeah!
She's the best little best little wife any man ever had and you don't appreciate her.
Yeah.
I think we ought to let her do the act with us.
Yeah!
Nothing doing.
No?
Well, let me put it this way: If she doesn't do it, I don't do it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah!
Safe!
You're out!
Foul ball!
Nobody loves the ump He's the apple of nobody's eye Nobody loves the ump And I'll never know, never know why Oh, they boo and they hiss and they holler at me Just because it's a ball and I call it strike three I'm not wearin' my glasses, so how can I see?
Nobody loves Nobody loves the ump If I call it a ball, then they call me a slob If I call it a strike, then they call out the mob If called off the game, I'd be out of a : Job : Job Job job You've got a lifetime job looking for that note.
Nobody loves Nobody loves Nobody loves the ump The very first inning, the fans all commence They belt me with bottles I take no offense 'Cause each one they throw, I return for two cents Nobody loves Nobody loves the ump : The poor old ump And that's without a lesson.
Oh, if Marge sees this, Gower's finished.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Ole!
That'll set Cuba back a hundred years.
What's the matter?
My spiked shoes are caught in the floor.
Spiked shoes?
Ay-ay-ay.
Well, come on, fellas.
Give me a couple of yanks.
Yanks?
You have to say that word?
Oh, come on.
The legs.

"Little Ricky Learns to Play the Drums"   Here you are, honey.
What do we say when someone gives us something?
You know, Little Ricky.
You remember what Daddy always says when somebody gives him something?
Gracias.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Don't do that at the table, dear.
Do that again, son.
Ricky.
Just a minute.
Listen to that beat.
What?
Listen to that wonderful beat.
Listen to the rhythm.
Hey!
Looks like he's gonna be a drummer.
Well, he certainly is not.
That's the last thing in the world I want him to be.
What's so bad with being a drummer?
It's just not good enough for a son of mine.
Well, it's good enough for a husband of yours.
Well, that's different.
How is it different?
He's my flesh and blood.
You're just a close relative.
Well, what do you want him to be?
I don't know.
I I'd like to see him Wouldn't you like to go in your room and play, darling?
Okay, Mommy.
All right, sweetheart.
Take your toast with you.
Let me wipe off your mouth a little bit.
There you are.
Run along.
I'd like to see him get into a dignified profession.
I'd like to see him be a doctor.
A doctor?
Mm-hmm.
Well, that's fine, honey.
Being a doctor is great, but, uh, I just thought that he should be a drummer because he showed ability.
You heard him.
That's natural talent.
Oh, "natural talent," my foot.
He's trying to get the oatmeal off his spoon.
He was not.
He was, too.
I don't care.
I think he should be a doctor.
Well, I think he should be a drummer.
A doctor.
A drummer.
Doctor.
Drummer.
Drummer.
Doctor.
Ah, fine.
You agree.
He's going to be a doctor.
You tricked me.
I did not.
He's gonna be a doctor and that's that.
Well, that is not that at all.
Yes, it is now, Ricky.
Just because I want him to be a doctor and you want him to be a doctor.
Never mind We'll He should be.
just see Oh, dear.
They're having a fight.
We'll see you later.
We're not having a fight.
Come on back here.
It's just that I'm right and he's too stubborn to admit it.
It's not that at all.
It is, too.
You just don't want to admit No!
that I'm right, that's all.
Hold it, hold it, hold Wait yip, yip, yip.
Would you stop not fighting for just a minute?
Lucy, I came over to see if I could borrow your fox stole to wear to the theater Saturday night.
Sure, honey, it's in the living room closet.
Oh, thank you!
Well, Fred, I got the theater tickets.
Oh.
Here's your pair.
Oh, thank you, Rick.
It was mighty nice of you to invite us.
That's all right.
Oh!
What's the matter with you?
For a minute I thought you were being strangled by a giant caterpillar.
Oh, Fred!
Oh, Lucy, this is a beautiful stole.
Thank you.
Come on, Fred.
You can go back to not fighting now.
We weren't fighting.
We were just trying to decide what Little Ricky should be when he grows up.
Hey, why don't we ask them?
After all, they're his godparents.
All right.
What do you think he should be?
A wealthy, distinguished doctor or a crummy, out-of-work drummer?
Well, thanks for putting it so impartially.
Well, that's all right.
Uh, why don't you let him decide for himself?
Yeah.
We never thought of that.
What about it?
All right.
We'll let him decide for himself.
Okay.
And neither one of us will try to influence him.
No, neither one will try to influence him.
We will let him decide for himself.
Yeah, we'll let him decide for himself.
All right.
Hey, Fred, did they deliver a package here for me?
Yeah.
I was just going to take it over to your apartment.
Oh, well, I, uh, I don't want you to do that.
I want you to keep it here for a while.
What are you doing, surprising Lucy with a new hat?
Well, uh it's not exactly a new hat, no It's a it's a sort of a drum.
How can it be "a sort of a drum"?
It's either a drum or it isn't.
Well, it is.
That's what it is.
It's a drum all right.
Now, Fred, I know what you're thinking.
But look at it this way.
I just want to have it there in case the child decides that he wants to play the drum someday, that's all.
Just to be prepared, you know.
Well, you-you should have heard seen him the other day at the breakfast table.
He got the thin' and he go "dink, dink, da.
" Oh, the boy has a tremendous amount of talent really.
Stop hemming and hawing.
I'm not Lucy.
Well, then, will you keep it here until the time is ripe?
Sure, I'll keep it.
Thanks a lot.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, partner.
What are you doing dressed that way?
I'm playing doctor.
Oh, you're playing doctor, huh?
Little Ricky?
Better get out of that outfit, dear.
You know, we want to surprise Daddy and he's gonna be home any Oh dear.
Yes, "Oh dear.
" I thought we weren't gonna try to influence him.
I thought we were gonna let him decide for himself.
Yes, now, we did say that, and he did decide for himself.
This afternoon we just happened to be in a toy store and he took me by the hand and dragged me over to the counter and pointed to the little doctor's kit.
He dragged you?
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Daddy, are you sick?
Just a little, son, yeah.
Stick out your tongue and say, "Ah.
"  There you see?
He's a natural-born doctor.
Come on, Daddy.
Ah Mm-hmm, you'd better have your tonsils out.
All right.
I'll do that.
Come down to my office tomorrow.
Okay, I will.
Now, you know isn't that the cutest thing?
Now, Ricky Of all the low tricks- influence him behind my back.
Oh shame!
Well, he will make a good doctor.
Ricky, this package is for you, but it came over to Give me that package!
What is it?
Let me see it.
Nothing, dear.
Well, what is it?
Let me see it.
Nothing at all.
Is it something for me?
Is it for me?
Is it?
Well, it was supposed to be a surprise, dear.
Oh, really?
It looked like a hatbox.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what it is.
It's a hat.
It's a hat I bought you for Easter.
Easter?
Yeah, well, I believe in doing my Easter shopping early, you know.
A hat from Schirmer's Music Company?
Oh-ho!
From Schirmer's Music Company, huh?
Yakety-yak, yakety-yak What'd I do?
Well, well, well.
Oh, it has a very good tone for a hat.
Yes, sir.
Well, now, I'm just gonna be the grandest lady in the Easter parade.
Hey, Rick, it's gone!
Somebody must have taken the  Uh-oh.
Well Leave it to you, Miss United Parcel.
How was I to know that that was a Come on, Let's get out of the combat zone!
Well, I guess the shame is on the other foot.
Well, you did it, too.
I don't care.
This drum goes back first thing in the morning.
All right.
So does that Junior Dr. Kildare Kit.
All right.
Okay.
All right, we'll start from scratch.
Okay, scratch.
Okay.
All right.
All right Honey, honey, let me take that.
Now, darling, it has to go back to the store in the morning.
No, Mommy.
Now, come on, give it to Mother.
Come on.
I want to play the drum.
Oh, now, honey, wouldn't you rather play with your little doctor's kit?
No, Mommy, I want to play the drum.
Well, all right.
I hate to admit it, but he does have a pretty good beat.
Ah, yeah   Well, what are you doing up so early?
Well, Little Ricky has a great beat, but it's not too good for sleeping.
Oh.
What time is it?
Yeah, you must be a sound sleeper.
He's been playing for the last hour.
He's been playing for the last four days.
Should I ask him to stop, honey?
No, no, no, no, no.
If he wants to play, we should let him play.
Yeah, that's the way I feel about it.
After all, we don't want to in-hi-bit him.
What?
We don't want to in-hi-bit him.
You know, frustrate.
Oh, in-hibit.
Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.
Oh, no, no, we don't want to do that to him.
Want me to get you some breakfast, honey?
Yeah.
How many eggs, dear?
Two.
: Two, two, two.
Well, that is a catchy beat, isn't it?
Yeah, it sure is.
I only wanted two eggs, dear.
: Fred?
Fred?
: Fred, Fred, Fred?
!
How can you stay so calm during all of this?
That drumming is driving me crazy.
Did you say something, Ethel?
Hey, that's a good idea.
Does it work?
Huh?
Does it work?
Well, they muffle the noise, but your ears get hotter than blazes.
Oh, we got to do something about this.
You bet your boots we do.
Let's go over there and ask them if they'd mind restricting Little Ricky's playing for just an hour or two a day.
An hour or two?
How about a minute or two?
Now, Fred, none of that.
None of that.
If we go over there, you got to be careful what you say.
Parents get awful touchy when you're talking about their children.
I'm sure that if we're nice and diplomatic, they'll be reasonable.
Let's go.
You know something?
Maybe he should be a doctor when he grows up.
I can't stand it.
I just can't stand it anymore.
Neither can I. He's just gonna have to cut down on his practicing, that's all.
Okay.
Hi, fellas.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
Oh, hi.
Listen, I'm awfully sorry about the noise.
Noise?
What noise?
Little Ricky's drumming.
Oh, that.
Well, we never noticed it.
Right, Ethel?
Right.
My, he certainly loves to play.
And, my, we certainly love to listen.
He has such a nice, steady beat.
Yeah, steady.
Well, we're glad it didn't bother you.
Yeah, me, too.
Bother us?
Oh, don't be silly.
Now that you brought it up, we thought it might not be a bad idea if he'd cut down a little.
Just a bit.
Just to give his little hands a rest.
Yeah, we're only thinking of the child.
Well, we were thinking of asking him to just What's that?
He stopped.
What a relief.
I thought he'd never quit.
What did you say?
Oh  No-no-nothing.
He's, he's just amazed at the child's stamina.
He didn't think anybody could keep up that racket for four whole days.
Racket?
That is not a very nice word to use about my son's playing.
We were under the impression that it was rhythm and music.
Rhythm it might be; music it ain't.
How would you know?
You got a tin ear.
Is that so?
!
Yeah, that's so.
Why don't you go ahead and say it?
Go ahead!
Come right out and say it.
Say you can't stand Little Ricky's drumming.
All right.
We can't stand Little Ricky's drumming.
How dare you say a thing like that?
!
Because it's true.
Oh!
Come on, Fred, let's get out of here before that pounding starts again.
Oh, what's the use?
It's just the same over in our place.
Well, don't blame that on Little Ricky.
Blame it on your cheap, thin walls.
Yeah.
As the owner of these cheap, thin walls I might have you evicted for disturbing the peace!
You wouldn't.
Oh, wouldn't we?
Out you go unless you put a muffler on that baby bongo beater.
Just a minute.
Just a cotton-pickin' minute.
Before you go evicting anybody, I got a piece of paper here.
Two years ago, when we wanted to move, you were so crazy about us as tenants that you gave us a 99-year lease.
Yeah.
That means for 97 more years, Little Ricky can play the drums.
Yeah!
Go ahead and play, son!
Oh, Fred, let's get out of this boiler factory!
With pleasure!
Honestly!
Huh!
Some friends.
How did we ever choose them to be our son's godparents?
I don't know.
Maybe we can turn them in and get two new ones.
Huh!
Sheesh!
Here are your theater tickets.
I'm afraid we've made other plans.
And here is your moth-eaten fur.
Moth-eaten?
I've trapped better-looking things than that underneath my kitchen sink.
Out!
: Out!
Out!
Out!
Don't count too much on that lease.
Landlords have a way of getting rid of undesirable tenants.
a cualquier cosa, viejo!
You said it!
Yeah!
What did we say?
It's very hard to translate, but take my word for it, it fits.
Good.
Yes, Mrs. Trumbull.
We're leaving for the theater at Well, the baby's already had his dinner, so if you'll just you'll come up any time you want.
Okay?
Okay, dear.
Hi.
Oh, hi!
How did everything go today?
Fine, fine.
Uh Mr. Mertz didn't pull any monkey business?
Haven't even seen him.
I knew he was just bluffing.
Sheesh.
Well, if we're gonna go to the theater, I'd better go get cleaned up.
All right, honey.
Dinner's almost ready.
I have a delicious roast chicken in the oven.
Good.
I'll just take a quick shave and a shower.
All right.
Hurry, up, huh?
All right.
Honey?
What?
Something is wrong with the electricity.
My shaver isn't working.
Something's wrong with the gas.
My chicken isn't working either.
What happened?
I don't know.
It's been in for two hours.
Funny, the gas and electricity would go on the fritz at the same t Oh, no.
What?
I'll bet this is the work of Freddie the Fritzer.
Oh he wouldn't go that far.
Well, we'll just see.
We'll just call the gentleman and find out.
Hello?
Mr. Mertz, this is your tenant, Mrs. Ricardo.
The gas and electricity are off.
Now, I know you're mean and sneaky, but you wouldn't stoop that low now, would you?
He is that mean and sneaky!
I'm gonna go over there and punch him right in the nose.
No, now, honey, that's just what he wants you to do.
He wants to pick a fight so he can ask us to leave.
Well, what are we gonna do?
Now, wait a minute.
The first thing in the morning I'll call the Board of Health to report him.
That'll fix him.
Yeah.
That's a good idea.
How do you like that guy?
Listen, we'll grab a bite to eat downtown.
All right, dear.
What am I gonna do about shaving?
Oh, you don't need a shave.
You look wonderful.
I'll just take a quick shower, huh?
Okay.
How did he ever forget that?
La-la-la di a-la di La-lai la-lei la-lai.
Hey, honey, I just thought of somethin'.
What?
What are we gonna do when Mrs. Trumbull comes over tonight?
She can't sit here in the dark all night long.
She's gonna take the baby back to her apartment, and we'll pick him up when we come back.
Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.
Oop!
?
Que paso?
El agua, se seco el agua.
No hay agua aqui.
What happened?
I know.
The water is off in the basin, too.
Phantom Freddie has struck again!
Ai!
Mira,?
que quiere el hombre de esta cosa?
Oh, honestly, that man.
Listen, honey, there's an an emergency valve in the back porch.
Go turn it back on.
Honey, I can't.
I can't see.
I- I-I I can't open my eyes.
I'll get soap in them.
Oh, all right, I'll go and get it.
I'm sorry, dear.
All right.
I'll get it.
Oh Oh, honestly, that man.
Hurry up, honey.
Que barbaridad  Sheesh.
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ai dios!
Ooh, hurry up, honey.
Yes, I'll I'm getting soap in my eyes.
Hurry up!
Oh, honey, Ooh!
all right.
Ooh!
Ooh You took the towel!
Oh, dear.
Oh, Ricky.
You took the towel.
For heaven's Ah!
Oh!
Oh!
Ah!
Honey, the water is back on!
You're telling me!
What happened?
What happened?
Oh, honestly, honey.
Look at me.
Oh, oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Honey, my hair.
Now I won't be able to go anyplace.
Oh, dear!
Darn that Fred Mertz!
What a fiend!
What a fiend that man is!
Oh He probably thinks that this is gonna make us move.
Well, he's got another thing coming.
We've only begun to fight.
You got an idea?
Follow me!
Okay.
Get this right here.
Here- you take this.
What are we gonna do?
They want to be nasty, we'll give them something to be nasty about.
Oh, a little drum concert, right?
Yes.
We're gonna play a little well-known Latin-American tune called "Nurtz to the Mertz Mambo.
"  Let them hear it, boy!
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
They're probably having dinner.
Let's play the serenade from the kitchen.
Oh, that's a good idea, yeah.
That way, they won't miss a single glorious beat.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
What are you doing?
Just a little added sound effects.
Ready?
Yeah.
One, two, three, four.
Just a minute!
Fred, go on, call the police!
He's not gonna call the police on my telephone.
Too cheap to use your own phone, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Too cheap to use your phone, huh?
Are you gonna stand there and let that Havana "Horace" Hite call you cheap?
No, I'm not!
Now put them up!
Listen, you lay a hand on me and you'll have to use the telephone Put them up!
to call the hospital!
Yeah.
Call the hospital!
Yeah, let me tell you, I can take you on, too.
What's the matter?
What happened?
Where's the baby?
I came up to take him.
He's not in his room.
Are you sure?
What?
!
He's not in his room?
Did you look every place, Mrs. Trumbull?
I looked all over the place.
Did you look in all the closets?
Oh Little Ricky?
Oh, Little Ricky?
No, he isn't in there!
No.
He isn't in there.
The door was open when I came in.
The door was open!
He might be outside!
I'll go get him.
I'll get my coat and go with you.
Get your coat, Fred.
I'll call the police!
Oh Operator?
Operator?
Operator, the police!
Get me the police!
Oh, Lucy, where do you suppose he went?
How do I know?
Take it easy.
He's wandering around outside.
Wait, wait, wait.
Take it easy, everybody.
Everything is all right.
Did you find him?
Follow me.
Never mind, operator.
Aw, the poor little thing.
He couldn't stand all that noise.
The next time we fight, we'll fight more quietly.
We're not going to have any more fights, Ethel.
It was all our fault.
No.
No, Fred, it was our fault.
We promise you from now on he won't play the drums so much.
You let him play the drums as much as he wants to.
He can do half of his practicing right here in our place.
Fred!
What's the matter, Ethel?
We're only going to be here for 97 years.
Oh, Lucy You think you can stand us that long?
Oh, Lucy, I'm so sorry, honey!
Ah, Rick.
All right, Fred.
"I Love Lucy" is a Desilu Production.
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz will be back next week at this same time.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
"Lucy Meets Orson Welles"   Come on, honey.
Oh, boy!
It sure was freezing out, wasn't it?
It's nice and warm in here, I'm glad.
Mommy.
What?
Why do we have to come in?
Because you were cold, honey.
No, I wasn't.
Yes, you were now.
Hi.
Hi, honey.
I saw you come in.
Yeah.
Did you have fun in the park?
Yeah, but it was so cold!
There you are, baby.
Ooh, I'm so cold!
Here, here's your apple, honey.
Go play with your train now.
So long.
Oh, Ethel, I'm so I'm just frozen.
Honestly, there's only one way I'm ever gonna be able to stand this New York winter.
How?
Spend it in Florida.
Well, winter is officially here.
We've had our first cold wave.
Fred's put on his red flannels, and you've started your annual "Let's Send Lucy To Florida" campaign.
Well, I don't see any reason why we couldn't spend just a few weeks in Florida.
Don't talk to me, talk to Ricky.
I'm going to, but it won't do any good.
He'll have a million excuses: It's too far, it's too expensive, and he can't get away.
Those are three of the worst excuses I ever heard in my whole life.
It's just ridiculous leaving us up here in this miserable weather when we could be down south enjoying the sunshine.
But does he ever think of us?
No!
He just thinks of himself.
Hi.
Hi, honey.
Don't "honey" me, you selfish beast.
And so, once again, it's time to play that well-known parlor game, "Kick The Cuban.
" Good luck, amigo.
Whatsa matter with everybody?
Why can't we go to Florida?
Well, first of all, there's a lot Who said anything about Florida?
I did, but we can't go because it's too far, it's too expensive, and you can't get away.
I didn't say a word!
Well, can we go?
No!
Why not?
Because it's too far, it's too expensive, and I can't get away.
Oh!
Everybody goes to Florida for the winter.
Even the birds go south.
All right, I'll make you a deal: If you can get there the same way the birds do, you can go.
Now, Ricky, listen Look, Florida is out of the question, so don't nag me.
LITTLE  Mommy!
Coming, dear.
Don't go away.
I've got a lot of nag I haven't even used yet.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Rick.
This is Paul.
Oh, yeah, hi, Paul.
Say, I've got great news for you.
I just spoke to Orson Welles' agent.
He's all set to do the benefit.
He'll meet you here this afternoon for rehearsal.
Oh, that's just wonderful!
Listen, is he gonna do the same act that he did in Las Vegas?
Yeah, some Shakespeare, and, of course, his magic routine.
Oh, that is just great.
What time am I supposed to meet him?
He's tied up autographing record albums at some department store until then.
Okay, I'll be there.
Oh, by the way, Orson needs an assistant for his magic act, so I suggested Lucy to him.
You did?
Yes.
You are fired!
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You don't have to blow your top!
It's only a benefit.
Look, whenever Lucy gets into the act, nobody benefits.
I'm, I'm sorry.
I'll get out of it.
Yeah, well, tell him that she's going out of town.
Oh?
Is she?
She is now.
She's going to Florida.
Oh.
Well, okay, I'll tell him.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Sheesh!
And another thing: You've always wanted Little Ricky to know to swim.
If we went to Florida, he could take swimming lessons.
I agree with you.
Yeah, that's right.
Don't listen to reason.
Just be pigheaded and stubborn and keep us here all What did you say?
I said that you were absolutely right.
Oh, honey!
Little Ricky and you should go to Florida.
Do you really mean it?
Of course I do.
I have been a selfish beast.
Oh, no, you haven't, honey!
Ethel!
Fred!
Come quick!
Oh, honey, you're the best husband in the whole world!
Oh, thank you!
You and Little Ricky can leave right away.
I'll come down as soon as I can.
Okay, honey.
What's the matter?
Guess what?
Guess what?
Ricky's sending me and the baby to Florida.
Wonderful!
Isn't that great?
I'm going to tell the baby, honey.
Oh!
Freddy you know, I'm commencing to feel this cold weather myself.
Well, you won't have to worry about the cold, honeybunch.
I won't?
Nope.
Tomorrow I'll run out and buy you a brand-new hot water bottle.
Oh, fine.
Ricky?
Yes, dear?
If I'm going to Florida, I'm going to have to buy a lot of new clothes.
You're right.
I am?
Yes.
Here, honey.
Oh.
Buy anything that you want.
Oh!
What happened to him?
I don't know, but let's get to the store before he snaps out of it.
I'll get my hat.
Well, I promised Little Ricky I'd get him a beach ball.
They ought to have one in here.
See, those are volleyballs.
Oh, Ethel, look at this!
What is that?
Skin diving equipment.
Oh, just what you need.
You're right.
I'm going to Florida.
I'm going to skin dive.
Now, Lucy, don't you get into enough trouble on dry land?
Oh, push-tush.
May I help you?
Yes.
I'd like to see some of the skin-diving equipment.
You know, I'd kind of like to try some of it on and see how it works.
Oh, well, this is our complete skin-diving kit.
Just step this way, please.
Skin diving kit!
I'll wait out here for you.
This way.
All right, honey.
Okay, thank you.
Oh, y'all just follow me into the record department here.
Now, if you select your records here, he'll be here any moment.
Oh, uh, pardon me, sir, but why is this crowd gathering?
Oh, they're waiting for Mr. Orson Welles.
Orson Welles!
Yes!
He's going to autograph his new Shakespearean album.
He'll be here any moment.
He'll be here?
!
Right here?
!
Yeah.
Just select one.
Here he comes!
Oh, well!
Oh!
Oh, Mr. Welles, I really want to see you.
Uh, Mr. Welles?
Lucy!
Lucy, Orson Welles is here!
Come on.
He won't stay long.
Come on.
Let us through.
Would you mind letting us through, please?
Mr. Welles!
My "Man From Mars" broadcast was 18 years ago.
What kept you?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Ethel, help me.
Let me help you.
I'm sorry, but you see, I'm going to Florida.
Underwater all the way, I presume?
No, no, of course not.
Mr. Welles, Mr. Welles, I've seen everything you've ever done- in movies, on the stage, in television.
I think you're just marvelous.
Just marvelous.
Me, too.
I think so, too.
Thank you.
Mr. Welles, you won't believe this, but I played Shakespeare in high school.
I believe it.
Yes, sir.
I-I played the lead in Romeo and Juliet in the senior play.
Did I ever tell you that?
Oh.
Oh, uh, uh, Mr. Welles, Mr. Welles, my dramatic teacher said that I was the best Juliet she'd ever seen, and she said that she wouldn't be a bit surprised if-if I ended up as LUCY AND  a star on the Broadway stage.
Hmm, uh, you took 16 curtain calls.
There wasn't a dry eye in the house.
You were in the audience!
Alas, no.
Well, then, how did you know?
Oh, every girl I ever meet has played poor Juliet to an audience that's practically awash with overactive tear ducts.
Well, I really was and they really were.
Hmm.
If you don't believe me, ask Miss Hanna.
Who's Miss Hanna?
Who's Miss Hanna?
!
Just the greatest dramatic teacher Jamestown High School ever had, that's all.
Oh, I see.
How many albums would you like?
Well, I'd like one.
Just autograph it to Ethel Mertz, please.
I'd take two, only we haven't got a phonograph.
I'll take one.
And please autograph it to that great Shakespearean actress, Lucy Ricardo.
Lucy Ricardo?
Wh-Where have I heard that name before?
Romeo and Juliet, Jamestown High School.
You're Ricky Ricardo's wife!
Oh, you know him?
But of course!
I'm doing that charity benefit at his nightclub.
You are?
Why, yes.
I'm, I'm terribly sorry you couldn't take me up on my offer.
Offer?
What offer?
!
Well, I wanted you to help me out in the act.
But Ricky said you were going to Florida.
Oh, he did, did he?
Yeah.
How do you like that?
How do you like that?
Oh That conniving Cuban!
No wonder he was so nice to you.
He just wanted to get you out of town until Mr. Welles blew over.
How about that?
: Mr., Mr. Welles Mr. Welles, is the job still open?
Well, you're, you're going to Florida.
Oh, I changed my mind.
I'd love to do the show for you.
Can I have the job, Mr. Welles?
Can I?
Can I?
Can I?
Mrs. Ricardo, please, take your flippers off me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but-but can I, can I have the job?
Well, I'm sure you can you can handle it very nicely.
If you'd just come over to your husband's nightclub this afternoon, we can rehearse.
I'll be there, sir.
I'll be there.
Did you hear that?
I heard.
I heard.
I got the job.
I got the job.
Oh, that's wonderful.
I'm going to do Shakespeare.
Good-bye, Mr. Welles.
"Farewell.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
" So we'll just charge these albums and send them out tomorrow.
Hey!
Did you hear that voice?
Yes!
You are going to be on that show.
He's a wonderful pal.
Yes, that's right, operator.
Jamestown, New York, 4755, please.
Hello?
Miss Hanna?
Yes?
Miss Hanna, this is Lucy Ricardo.
Who?
Lucy Ricardo.
Lucy McGillicuddy.
Who?
Juliet.
Juliet McGillicuddy?
No, Miss Hanna.
Uh, uh, I played Juliet.
Herman Schlup was Romeo.
Herman Schlup.
Now, let me see.
Herman was so short, we had to lower the balcony two feet.
Oh, of course!
Lucy McGillicuddy.
Well, how are you, little Lucy?
I'm fine, Miss Hanna.
Guess what?
I'm going to do Shakespeare with Orson Welles!
What class was he in, dear?
No, Miss Hanna, the famous Orson Welles.
Oh, that one.
Oh, how exciting!
Yes, isn't it?
We're appearing at my husband's nightclub this Friday night here in New York, and I thought maybe you could come up and watch me perform.
Friday?
Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear, but it's the drama class's opening night of The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial.
One of the boys is sick, and I may have to play Captain Queeg.
Oh.
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Hanna.
Well, may I send you the notices?
Oh, would you, my dear?
Thank you so much.
And good luck, Lucy.
And remember, project.
: Play to the balcony!
Oh, I will, Miss Hanna.
Good-bye.
I mean : Good-bye, Miss Hanna.
"Dost thou love me?
"I know thou wilt say 'aye.
' "Aye?
Aye"!
Is Ricky home?
No, not yet.
I thought I heard someone saying "ay-ay-ay.
" That was me.
I'm practicing playing to the balcony.
Oh.
I heard all that yelling, and I thought you two were having a fight.
Well, stick around, girl.
I'm gonna tell him just what I think of his little scheme of shipping me out of town.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Hi, Ethel.
Well, did you find some nice clothes for Florida?
Yes, I found a lot of cute things at Macy's.
Good.
After all, I want my wife to be well dressed.
Guess what else I found at Macy's?
What?
Orson Welles, and we had a very interesting little chat.
Bye.
Where do you think you're going?
From the look in your eyes, back to Cuba.
You come right back here.
What a cheap chiseling trick trying to bundle me off to Florida just to keep me from playing Shakespeare with Orson Welles!
What are you talking about, "Shakespeare"?
All he wanted you to do was help in his magician act.
He did not want me to help in his magician act!
He did, too.
He just wanted you to hand him things while he performs.
I don't believe you.
It's true!
Uh as a matter of fact, that's why I turned him down.
I was only thinking of you.
How do you figure?
Well, it was, eh such a nothing part that, uh, I wanted to save you the embarrassment of having to turn him down.
Now you understand?
Well, when you put it that way, yes.
I understand.
Ah, now, I knew you would.
Thank you for protecting me.
I will always do that.
I'll talk to you when I come back from the club.
All right, honey.
I just stopped by to pick my briefcase.
Okay.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Rick.
Good-bye, dear.
What a sweetheart.
What a phony.
What do you mean?
You didn't believe all that hokum, did you?
That's just another one of his tricks.
Lucy, are you sure?
Sure, I'm sure.
Would he send me all the way to Florida just to keep me from handing Orson Welles a hat full of rabbits?
No.
What a phony!
It's Shakespeare all right.
Ethel, will you cue me?
I want to go over my lines again.
Sure, I will.
Gee, I just want to be letter-perfect when I go to rehearsal.
Who knows?
With Orson Welles playing opposite me, I might even top my performance at Jamestown High School.
Listen, I like some of these pictures.
They're very good.
This is good.
Mm-hmm.
I don't like this one.
It's too much teeth.
ORSON  All right put all those rabbits in the cloak room and I'll be, uh Hi, Orson.
Hello, Ricky.
Glad to see you.
Listen, it's just wonderful of you to do this benefit for us.
Oh, it's my pleasure.
I saw your act in Las Vegas Really?
and I thought you were just great.
Thanks.
Oh, uh, incidentally, uh, Lucy won't be able to be your assistant after all.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I saw her in Macy's, and she told me that she'd love to do it.
Yeah, I know, but she changed her mind.
Would you sit down?
I'll get you some coffee.
Sure, sure.
I guess, uh, you'll just have to find somebody else to saw in half.
Oh, I don't saw anybody in half anymore.
I do the, uh, levitation trick.
The what?
The levitation.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, uh, she can't do that, whatever it is.
Well, that's where I raise somebody off the ground, you know.
Uh-huh.
Well, uh, Lucy's two feet off the ground always anyway, but she can't do it.
Well, I'm sorry.
Better safe than sorry.
Why?
Well, it just seems that every time that Lucy gets close to famous people, something happens to them.
You mean she really did all those things in Europe and Hollywood?
Every one of them.
And they call me a character.
Well, I could tell you stories about this girl that you wouldn't believe.
Like one time "Oh, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?
"Deny thy father and refuse thy name or "if thou wilt not be but sworn, my love, and I'll no longer be a Capulet.
" What do you think, Mr. Welles?
Uh, well tha that had its moments.
There was a a certain indefinable something about it.
What about it, Ricky?
Lucy, I thought I told you that Mr. Welles wanted you for his assistant in his magic act.
You don't think I fell for that, do you?
No, but it's true.
I really do.
Oh, Mr. Welles, I promised my dramatic teacher that I was going to do Shakespeare with you.
I even promised I'd send her the notices.
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
Lucy, can't you see that Mr. Welles does not want to do Shakespeare with you?
You keep out of this!
Mr. Welles, won't you at least read a scene with me?
It's been my lifelong ambition to do Shakespeare with you, Mr. Welles.
Lucy.
I think you're the greatest Shakespearean actor in the whole world.
I think You're better than John Gielgud.
I think you're better than than Maurice Evans.
I think you're better than than Sir Ralph Richardson.
You left out Laurence Olivier.
Well, I think you're better than he is, too.
You really think so?
Yes, I do, Mr. Welles.
I really do.
Please do Shakespeare with me.
Just read a scene with me now so that I can tell my grandchildren about it someday.
Please, Mr. Welles.
"What man art thou "that thus bescreened in night, so stumblest on my counsel.
" Lucy, can't you see that Mr. Welles does not want to do Shakespeare with you?
You keep out of this.
"By a name, dear heart, "I know not how to tell you how I am.
"My name is hateful to myself.
Had I it written, I would tear the words.
" "Had I it written, I would tear the words.
" That's the cue.
"I " "Had I it written, I would " I know, I guess I'm a little nervous at last playing with the great Orson Welles.
Oh, why don't we do my favorite scene?
What's that?
"For fear of that I still "will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again.
" Oh, that one.
Well, I'm already dead in that scene.
Yes, yes.
"Here, here will I set up my everlasting rest " But Mr. Welles, you just have the soliloquy in that one.
" and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars I don't have it.
"from this world-wearied flesh.
"Eyes, look your last.
I "Arms, take your last embrace.
"And lips, o you the doors of breath "seal with a righteous kiss, "a dateless bargain to engrossing death.
"Come, bitter conduct.
"Come, unsavory guide.
"Thou desperate pilot "run at once thy seasick weary barque.
"Here's to my love.
"O, true apothecary, thy drugs are quick.
"Thus with a kiss, I die.
" Boy, you're sure a lot better than Herman Schlup!
Thank you.
You're just wonderful.
Mr. Welles, are you sure you won't change your mind and-and let me do just a little Shakespeare in your act with you?
Well, you see, The way the act is built I know, I'm a lot better when I'm not nervous, Mr. Welles.
The way it's arranged, we just do the soliloquies, you understand?
But my offer still stands for you to do the assistant in the magic act.
Well, I don't know.
Well, take it or leave it.
I'll take it.
Good.
All right, Ricky, come on.
Let me show you Oh, honey, aren't you excited?
This is gonna be your big night.
Yeah, what a comedown- from a Shakespearean actress to a magician's stooge.
What are you complaining about?
I turned out to be the stooge's hairdresser.
Come in.
Miss Hanna!
Lucy McGillicuddy!
Oh, Miss Hanna, what a surprise!
Oh, this is Miss Hanna, my high school dramatic teacher.
Miss Hanna, Mrs. Mertz.
How do you do?
Lucy's told me all about you.
Oh, she has?
Oh, little Lucy.
Oh, Miss Hanna, won't you sit down?
Mi-Miss Hanna, what happened to Caine Mutiny Court-Martial?
Well, we postponed it until Captain Queeg gets over the chicken pox.
Oh.
Well, Miss Hanna So I brought the rest of the cast with me.
You did?
Oh, imagine, you and Orson Welles.
Oh, I'm sure it'll be an evening of sheer magic.
You can say that again.
Miss Miss Hanna, about this evening My dear, I've been teaching drama for and this is the proudest night of my life.
It is?
Oh, just to hear you do that balcony scene with Orson Welles will make my entire teaching career worthwhile.
Miss Hanna, I have something to tell you.
I Yes, Juliet?
I'll see you after the show, Miss Hanna.
All right, my dear.
And remember what I told you: project.
Yes.
Tr-r-r-rippingly on the tongue.
Oh, Lucy, you should've told her.
She's in for an awful letdown.
No, she isn't.
What do you mean by that?
I am not going to disappoint Miss Hanna.
Somehow, someway, I'm going to do Shakespeare.
And now enough of Shakespeare.
We'll try to entertain you now with a few feats of magic, legerdemain, hanky-panky and sidearm snookery.
From the mysterious East     The inscrutable the inimitable the mysterious Princess Lu-Si.
Professor       Ladies and gentlemen, please.
I must beg you not to make the slightest sound 'cause the princess is in a state of trance.
"Oh, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo"?
Bravo, bravo!
"Deny thy father  refuse thy name " Apparently the princess is not, uh, in a deep enough condition of trance.
Now the princess will feel nothing and definitely speak nothing.
"Oh, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo"?
It just happens that I have a pack of playing cards in my hand.
" and refuse thy name or if thou wilt not " Perhaps somebody "Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo"?
Romeo?
Romeo, get me down from here.
Romeo!
"I Love Lucy" starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz has been presented for your pleasure by Instant Sanka, the hardy coffee you can drink as strong as you like, it still can't affect your nerves.
The role of Miss Hanna was played by Ellen Corby.
Orson Welles portrayed himself.
"I Love Lucy" is a Desilu production.
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz will be back next week at this same time.

Yeah.
What about my lunch?
Oh, yeah.
Right away, dear.
I was getting Little Ricky ready for his recital.
He looks so cute.
Good.
Oh, I'm so nervous.
Imagine our son playing drums in public for the first time.
Yeah, it's quite an occasion all right.
Oh, it sure is.
Hmm.
Well?
Well what?
What about my lunch?
Oh, yes, honey.
I got a nice sandwich for you all ready in the refrigerator.
That's funny.
Lucy What?
The refrigerator is that big, white thing back there.
Oh, sure.
What's the matter with me?
Here it is.
There you are, dear.
Thank you.
And I have some hot coffee here.
Here we are.
Oh, gee, isn't this exciting?
Mm-hmm.
Mmm!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Oh, honey, it's too hot.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, look, we'll just do this.
This is what my mother used to do.
There we are.
That'll cool it off.
There you are, dear.
It's cooler all right, but I like it a little stronger.
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
There you are, dear.
Mmm, honey, it's still too hot.
Maybe an ice cube will help, huh?
An ice cube, an ice cube, an ice cube.
Yeah.
Okay, dear.
Here we are.
There's an ice cube for you.
That's a very good idea.
Lucy Yeah?
Do you always put the ice cubes in the oven?
Oh, no.
Not always, dear.
No.
Honey, calm down.
Why are you so nervous?
Oh, honey, I can't help it.
I just can't help it.
He's such a baby.
Do you think we're rushing him?
Aw, now, honey, it's just a little recital at his music school.
I know, I know, but this is such a big moment in my child's life.
I'm just nervous about it.
That's all.
What's with you?
It's your child, too.
How come you're so calm?
Well, what is there to be uncalm about?
Nothing to worry.
At the recital, he'll be great.
Now, uh, are you ready?
Yeah, I'm all ready.
Is Little Ricky ready?
Yeah, he's ready.
How about you?
I've been ready for hours.
Come on, let's go.
Oh, honey, look at you.
Not nervous, huh?
Well, I guess so.
Yeah, I guess you are.
I'll call the Mertzes and see if they're ready.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi.
Have you seen Ethel?
I can't find my green tie.
No.
She hasn't been here.
Well, I'll be ready in a minute.
Yeah, hurry up.
Lucy, have you seen Fred?
I was taking the spot off his tie.
I can't find him anywhere.
He was just here looking for you.
Oh, thanks.
Are you sure Ethel isn't over here?
She was just here looking for you.
Well, I'll find her.
Lucy, he isn't over there.
Over there.
FRED AND  Where have you been?
!
I've been looking all over for you.
How do you like that?
For the first time in 20 years, we've been trying to find each other.
Get your tie on.
Let's go.
Oh, hi.
Yeah, hi.
Come on.
Let's get going.
All right.
We're all ready, dear.
Oh, I'm as nervous as a cat.
Me, too.
I was so nervous, I couldn't eat my breakfast.
And, believe me, for Ethel, that's nervous.
Oh, look who's talking.
He was so nervous, he got dressed first and then took a shower.
Ethel, have we no family secrets?
Why is everybody so jittery?
Yeah, what's the matter with us?
It's silly to be this way.
'Course, the kid has been taking drum lessons for a month and we know he's good.
Good?
Why, he's wonderful.
That kid's dynamite.
That's right.
So what do we have to worry about?
Yeah, why worry about it?
Honey, do you really think he's good?
Now, look, Lucy, I have complete confidence in the boy.
It just so happens that he has inherited his father's musical ability.
Yeah, but is he good?
Look, didn't Mr. Crawford said that he was the best drummer in the school?
Uh-huh.
Well, there you are.
'Course he's the only drummer in the school.
Now, honey, don't worry Hi, Uncle Fred.
Hi, Aunt Ethel.
Oh, hi!
There he is.
Well, now, how do you feel, honey?
Fine, Mommy.
Look how calm he is.
Sure.
Perfectly relaxed.
That's kids for you.
You're not nervous, are you, honey?
No.
Yeah, he's not a bit nervous.
We knew you wouldn't be.
Mommy What, honey?
what's nervous?
Nervous?
Well, that's, uh, when you get stage fright, like when you're playing drums in front of strangers!
Oh, go get your coat on, honey.
Yeah, get your coat.
We'll get our hats and coats, honey.
We'll be right back.
We can help you with the drums.
Okay.
What's the matter with you?
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to say anything in front of him.
I didn't want to put ideas in his head, but I just didn't think Well, maybe it didn't register, but just, you know, if we're calm, then he'll be calm now.
Yeah.
Just you and I don't It's kind of hard to be calm.
Well, just you and I don't get nervous Okay.
and then the kid will be all right.
If we don't get all upset I just didn't think that Come on now, we don't want to be late.
You're not nervous, are you, Rick?
No, not nervous.
Well, the two coats were there, and then we were talking.
I didn't didn't see what I was doing.
Let's go.
Let's get this Everybody grab something.
All right.
Let's go.
I can carry this.
Okay.
Now  Have we got everything?
I think so.
Sorry, dear.
I got the bass drum.
Here's the snares.
I got the cymbal.
I got the tom-tom.
Okay, we've got everything.
Let's go.
All right, here we go.
Thank you.
Thank you, Laurie Blaine.
That was very nice, Laurie.
That was really very nice.
Now, Diana Van Fossen will favor us with a selection on the violin.
Diana.
That's my little girl.
Oh, she's very sweet.
She's very good.
Thank you.
Oh, that was Diana Van Fossen.
Oh, say, Diana Aw, say, that was nice.
Now, as a, as a finale for our little recital here, our own little six-piece band is going to play "Has Anybody Seen My Gal"?
Well, well, first, on bass, Buddy Noble.
Buddy, Buddy, come in.
Bass.
Ukelele, Earl Robie.
Come in, Earl.
And trumpet, Robert Norman.
Come in, Robert.
And trombone, Jeff Woodruff.
Hello, Jeff.
And accordion, Larry Gleason.
Come, Larry.
Come on, Larry.
And on drums, Ricky Ricardo, Jr. Yeah!
And on drums, Ricky Ricardo, Jr.  LITTLE  No, no!
No, no, no, no, no!
Mom-mom- What  What's the matter, honey?
Mommy, Mommy What's the matter?
I'm nervous, Mommy.
I got stage fright.
I told you He's got stage fright.
Oh, he's sorry.
He's got stage fright.
It's all right.
Look, Ricky.
It's all right, Ricky.
Lucy.
What?
What are you doing?
Well, his drums have been in the closet for three whole days.
He hasn't even gone near them.
I thought maybe if I put them out in plain sight I thought we agreed not to force him to play.
Who's forcing him?
I'm just going to use the power of suggestion.
If he sees the drums out here, he may want to play them, that's all.
All right, but I don't want to make him play.
I want it to be his own idea.
Oh, honey.
Now you know I won't make him do anything he didn't want to do.
I won't say a word.
The drums will be out here.
If he wants to play them, fine.
Okay.
I gotta go get finish dressing.
I gotta get out of here.
All right, honey.
Hi.
You want to go to the grocery store with me?
I can in about half an hour.
Oh, Lucy, Little Ricky's playing his drums again.
No, no, no, honey, this is just my idea.
I thought if I put them out, maybe I'd put the idea in his head.
Oh.
Gee, I sure hope it works.
Oh, me, too.
Call me when you're ready to go to the store.
Okay, dear.
Maybe I can get a little dusting done.
Okay.
Now, Lucy you'll be glad to know that I'm going to fix that loose railing on the back porch.
Well, what's the rush?
We only reported it five years and three delivery boys ago.
Very, very funny.
Hey, is my godson coming out of retirement?
No, your godson isn't coming out of retirement.
I'm just putting the drums out here.
If he wants to play them, he can.
Now, listen, mother hen, don't peck at me because you're upset about your baby chick.
Little Ricky.
Yes.
Hi.
What you doing, honey?
Just playing.
Oh.
Oh, boy!
That's what I've been wanting to play with!
It is?
Yeah.
My crayons.
Your crayons.
By George, somebody put your drums out here!
They look kind of lonely.
I bet they wish somebody would play them.
Well, if nobody wants to play them, I think I will.
I'm playing your drums.
Oh, Little Ricky, come back here.
Look at the fun I'm having.
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da Bum, bum, bum, bum bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, da, da Little Ricky!
I knew it!
I knew it!
Honey, you were right!
Back to your chores, fellow loved ones.
I goofed.
Didn't anything happen?
Well, nothing, except I may put out an album called Music To Color By.
Do you really think so, Mr. Crawford?
Ooh, absolutely.
Stage fright is just like falling off a horse.
If you don't get right back on, you'll never ride again.
Is that so?
Yes, and I want you to know, Mrs. Ricardo, I'm every bit as concerned about your boy as you and Mr. Ricardo are.
Well, thank you, Mr. Crawford.
We certainly appreciate that, and thanks for the advice.
I'll I'll talk to my husband when he comes in.
Ah, good-bye.
Good-bye, Mr. Crawford.
What does he want to talk to me about, honey?
Little Ricky's got to get right back on his horse.
What?
!
When you fall off a horse, you've got to get right back on.
Little Ricky fell off a horse?
What was he doing on a horse?
Oh, relax, honey, he didn't really fall off a horse.
Oh.
Why did you say so?
Mr. Crawford was just using a figure of speech.
He meant that if we wanted to help Little Ricky get over his stage fright, we wanted to make sure that he played in public again as soon as possible.
Oh.
Well, that's the way he got frightened in the first place.
That's just the point.
This is now the cure.
Well, I don't know, honey.
I think we're making too much of this.
Maybe the kid just doesn't want to play the drums.
Look, whether he wants to play the drums or not is no longer important.
The big thing now is his fear.
Being afraid to play at the recital was only the beginning.
From here on, he could develop a fear of all sorts of things.
He might be afraid to go to school.
He might be afraid to meet people, appear in public.
Why, if we don't conquer this right now, it could ruin his whole life.
Well, that makes a lot of sense.
Boy, I'm sure glad that you're the mother of my child.
Well, thank you, dear.
When I think of all those other women I might have married : Yeah, you sure were lucky.
All what other women?
Uh like you say, we have enough problems already.
Yeah.
We'll just talk about that later.
Right now the important thing is finding a place for Little Ricky to play in public as soon as possible.
All right.
What do you suggest?
Well, I was thinking why can't Little Ricky and his band play at your club one night?
Lucy what's come over you?
Bad idea, huh?
No.
Good idea.
What's come over you?
Well, I don't know.
I guess I just make a mistake now and then.
I think it's a wonderful idea.
You do?
Oh, sure.
It's probably just what he needs to snap him out of this mood that he's in.
Uh-huh.
And I bet you that the audience will love it.
Well, honey, I'm so happy you like my suggestion.
Yes, baby.
Close your eyes, Ethel.
I don't want you to get any wild ideas.
Hi.
Hi.
We bought Little Ricky a present.
Oh, how cute.
A little teddy bear that plays the drum.
We figured he might take the hint.
That cost 49 cents, but in a case like this, money is no object.
Well, gee, it's a wonderful idea and thanks a lot, but I think we've got the problem all settled.
You have?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're gonna have Little Ricky and his band play at the Club Babalu one night.
You are?
!
Yeah.
We decided that if he's not going to go through life being afraid, he has he just has to play the drums again.
Right away.
Oh, of course!
Oh, boy, I'm glad it's all settled.
Wait a minute.
Is it all settled?
If we can't get him to play here in the living room, how are we going to get him to play at the club?
Hey, that's right.
If we could get him to play at the club, we wouldn't have to get him to play at the club.
That makes sense.
Or does it?
Of course it does.
The trick is how to get Little Ricky to do it.
Oh.
One of us will just have to go in there and talk him into it.
Okay.
Well?
You're his father.
You're his mother.
Well, now that we got it straight who his parents are, which one is going in there and talk to him?
Why don't you?
Me?
Yeah.
Why not?
You're his godfather.
Well, you're his godmother.
Well, now that we got it straight who his godparents are, which one of you is going to go in there and talk to him?
Go ahead, Ethel.
Me?
Yeah, go ahead, Ethel.
All right, I will.
I'll use reverse psychology on him.
That always works with children.
Mm-hmm.
Well?
What happened?
Did your reverse psychology work?
Not exactly.
I said, "Little Ricky, you don't want to play those nasty old drums, do you"?
And he said, "No.
" Oh, my.
Well, now what will we do?
All right, all right.
You can talk him out of his stage fright.
If anybody can talk anybody into doing anything, it's Lucy.
Yeah, she's good at that sort of thing.
Sure.
Next.
What's the matter?
Can't you talk him into it?
I got stage fright.
Oh, no.
Well, I guess that leaves you and me, Fred.
It leaves you.
I'm chicken.
Very well.
Hi, pardner.
Hi, Daddy.
I brought a surprise for you.
It's a present from Uncle Fred and Aunt Ethel.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Um What do you say we have a little talk, huh?
Okay.
You know, when I was a little boy your age, I used to love to go down to my daddy's office and visit him, but I don't have an office.
I work in a nightclub.
The Babalu?
That's right.
How'd you like to come to the Babalu and visit me?
I'd like that, Daddy.
Okay.
And, uh, would you like to bring your drums with you and your little band and play there?
Will you be there, Daddy?
I sure will.
Will other people be there?
Yeah.
I'll stay home.
You'll stay home, huh?
Why?
Are you afraid?
Well, now, you come over here, pardner.
You know, I want to tell you something.
It's all right to be afraid.
You know, when I play in front of people, I'm afraid, too.
I don't know whether they're going to like me or whether they're going to laugh at me or what.
Is that the way you feel?
Yes, Daddy.
But the minute I start playing, the minute that I hear the music, I'm not afraid anymore.
I'll show you what I mean.
You see our little friend here?
Look at that.
He's so scared, he can't even move.
Now, let's pretend that he's gonna play at the club, see?
And let's pretend that all these are the people in the audience and they're all sitting around and they're gonna watch him play the drums, see?
Now, let's see what happens to him, okay?
: Look at him go, see?
He's not afraid anymore.
And look at them.
They're not laughing at him.
They like him.
And if they like him, they'll like you a lot more, because you're a much better drummer than he is.
So, uh what do you say, pardner?
Okay, pardner.
Good boy.
There you are, Robert.
Oh, Robert looks great, doesn't he?
There you are, honey.
Okay.
There you are.
Oh, hi.
Everybody here, Mr. Crawford?
Everybody but Earl Robie, the ukelele player.
Well, you'd better call the house and find out if he's left.
Well, that's a good idea.
Yeah.
Listen, kids, you want to peek at the audience through the curtains?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Peek at the audience, that's lots of fun.
Get your instruments.
We might as well put them on the bandstand, huh?
Well, listen, honey, will you bring him right back?
Want to go, Ricky?
Sure, I'll bring him right back.
Because I haven't finished dressing him yet.
Okay.
I'll bring him right back.
You come right back now, darling.
Just let him take a peek.
Okay.
Oh, don't they look cute?
I'll say.
Yes, yes.
Oh, boy, I hope this idea works.
Me, too.
My stomach's so full of butterflies, I could start a collection.
Honey, now, whatever you do, don't say anything about being nervous in front of Little Ricky.
Oh, no, now, Fred, don't even mention the word "scared" or "stage fright" now.
Okay, okay.
Be sure.
Don't forget now.
Okay, son.
Hey, uh Get him ready right away, Mom.
I'm starting the show right now.
All right, honey, we will.
Well, did you see all the nice people?
I'll say.
How do you feel, honey?
Fine, Mommy.
Attaboy.
You're not the least bit ner What are you trying to do, scare Watch yourselves.
You're going to give Little Ricky sta ay as sweet as you are, dear.
Oh, dear!
What's the matter?
Of all things.
What?
Earl Robie can't be here.
He has the measles.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
No ukelele player.
And they've rehearsed for six, and now they've only got five.
I don't know how it'll sound.
It will just blow the whole thing wide open.
Mr. Crawford Oh, oh, this is the most terrible thing that could have happened to us.
Mr. Crawford Oh, what a cata No, ukelele!
Mr. Crawford Yes, but I told Mr. Ricardo that I I'm so nervous.
Mr. Crawford.
Here, honey.
Put your hat on, sweetheart.
Here we go.
We're all ready now.
Mommy Yes, dear?
I don't want to play without a ukelele.
Oh, now, honey, don't worry about a thing.
Everything is going to be just fine.
Here are your drumsticks.
But I don't want to play without a ukelele.
Now, look, honey Honey, look, I promise you I promise you, you'll have a ukelele player.
Do you hear?
Fred, get a message to Ricky.
Tell him the band will play as scheduled.
All right, all right.
Look, fix his coat.
Okay, I'll fix his coat.
I'll button up your coat.
And you go out there and just be great and play your drums.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

Let's get it on!

Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz will be back next week at this same time.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
"Visitor from Italy"   Listen, I'll go get Fred and Ethel.
Oh, don't bother, honey.
They'll be right over.
Oh, all right.
Hey, you know something?
We haven't played bridge since before we went to Europe.
I know.
I'll bet I've forgotten everything I ever knew about bridge.
Good, then maybe we can win.
Oh, pooh.
Well, why the formality?
Come on in.
Really.
Yes?
Senora Ricardo.
Senora Ricardo, it's so good to see you again.
It's so good to see you again, Senor Ricardo.
Uh, well, uh, it's good to see you again, too.
Yeah, yeah, it sure is.
You know, you said, "If ever you come to America, you must be sure and stop and say hello.
" Hello.
Hello.
When I got off of the boat this morning from Italy, I said to myself, "Suppose the Ricardos don't remember me"?
Oh, not remember you?
Oh-ho, imagine not remembering him.
Yeah.
How about that?
You  How could we possibly forget you?
Yeah, good ol' you.
Uh, Ricky, can I see you in the kitchen for a moment?
Yes, dear, yeah.
Will you sit down?
Yeah.
Make yourself at home.
Grazie.
Excusa momento.
Grazie.
Yeah.
: Who is he?
I don't know.
His face is awfully familiar, but I I Well, think.
Now, who do we know from Italy?
I can't place him, honey.
I know.
Florence.
Florence who?
Florence, Italy.
He's that friend of the Leders' that was so nice to us.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
So, you just got off the boat today, huh?
That's right.
And New York, she's a beautiful city.
Yeah, well, not as half as beautiful as Florence, I'll bet.
By the way, how are things in Florence?
I don't know.
I was never in Florence.
So, you just got off the boat today, huh?
That's right.
And when I got off the boat in America, I said to myself, I says, "Mario " Mario.
Mario?
I said, "Mario, the first thing you got to do is to look up your old friends, the Ricardos and the Mertzes.
" Oh, the Mertzes.
The Mertzes!
Well, they live right across the hall.
Yeah.
I'll go get them.
I'll go get them.
Yeah, they live Ah!
Uh, look who's here.
Mario!
Yeah, Mario.
Mario, oh, how are you?
Senora Mertz.
Oh, and Senor Mertz.
Man, what a surprise.
How's it going, boy?
Fine.
Just fine.
Fred, Ethel, could we see you in the kitchen for a moment, please?
Yeah.
Sit down, Mario.
Excusa minute.
Sit down.
Grazie.
Grazie.
Who is he?
Don't you know?
No.
Don't you?
No.
I thought you did.
Oh, dear.
All we know is that his name is Mario, and he met us someplace in Europe.
Well, I got a clue.
What?
What?
He's Italian.
Listen, let's see if we can try to find out what-what city he's from.
That's a good idea.
Yeah, if we know the city, maybe we can place his face.
Yeah.
Yeah, huh?
Well, we we certainly enjoyed our trip through Italy.
Rome?
Naples?
Genoa?
San Remo Oh, San Remo!
San Remo!
San Remo!
San Remo!
Someday I would like to go there.
So, you just got off the boat today, huh?
That's right.
And you know something?
You haven't changed a bit.
You all look just like you look in the picture you gave me.
Picture?
The one you took in my gondola on the Grand Canal.
Gondola!
Grand canal.
Venice.
Mario!
Mario, the gondolier!
Ah, si, bueno.
Ah, si, Mario.
How long you gonna be in town?
Well, just for few months.
Oh.
I- I come to surprise my brother Dominic.
Oh, that's right.
You told us you had a brother in New York.
Yeah.
That's right.
He was not there.
Oh?
Somebody said he went to visit Sam Francesco.
I wrote it down on a piece of paper.
Ah ah ah, ah.
Maybe Mrs. Ricardo, maybe you can help me.
Sure.
How can I find this Sam Francesco?
Well, let's see now Well, my writing, she's not so pretty good.
No.
That's all right.
"44 West Third " Oh, this isn't Sam Francesco.
It's San Francisco.
Who?
Not "who," "what.
" San Francisco's a big city.
Oh well, maybe you can tell me how I get there.
Can I, can I walk?
Oh, not from New York, no.
It's 3,000 miles away.
Eh!
Yes, you'll have to take a train or a plane or bus.
Yeah.
Train, plane oh.
Well, I got $10.
Is she enough?
Oh, no, I'm afraid she isn't.
No.
It's about $60 by bus.
$60.
Mama mia!
Oh, well, now, Mario, don't worry.
We'll all chip in and help you.
Sure, Mario.
We'll give you the money.
Sure, we'll be glad to.
Won't we, Fred?
Yeah, glad.
No, no, I'm sorry.
Borrowing is no way to start a vacation in America.
No.
Well, why not?
That's the way Americans always start their vacations.
Besides, if we don't give you the money, how you going to get to see your brother?
Yeah.
Well, I work.
I get a job and make the money to pay the the bus.
Well, all right, Mario.
If you want to get a job, we'll help you get a job.
Sure.
Mario, what can you do?
Well, I'm the best gondolier in all of Venice.
Oh, dear.
No, I'm afraid it's slack season for gondoliers in New York.
Unless you go down to Canal Street.
Fred.
Hey!
I- I got an idea.
I know where he can get a job- in Ricky's nightclub.
He can?
Yeah.
He can work as a busboy.
He can?
Sure.
He can make $60 in a couple of nights.
He can?
Well, if he won't take the job, I will.
Uh, look.
You stay here with us and-and then you go to work tomorrow night.
$60 for two days.
My goodness.
America, she's a great country.
Good morning, honey.
Morning.
Where's Mario?
I don't know.
He was gone when I got up.
Look, when he comes back, give him this check for $60 and put him on the bus.
Put him on the bus?
Why?
Is something wrong?
Oh, no, no, no.
You and your bright ideas.
What happened?
Well, first of all, he thought that the nightclub was in a canal in Venice.
What do you mean?
He collected all the garbage and threw it out the window.
Well, now, that was a honest mistake.
That's just the beginning.
When I stopped singing "Babalu," he stopped to applaud.
So what?
I've seen busboys applaud before.
While they're carrying a tray full of dishes?
Well, he's not the first busboy that ever drop a tray full of dishes Wait, wait, there's more.
There's more?
Yeah.
As he bent over to clean the mess that he had made, the maitre d' was coming in with a cake for some newlyweds.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
He tripped over Mario, the whole thing went up in the air, and that bride and groom have the world's first upside-down wedding cake.
Oh, my goodness.
What happened to Mario then?
The last I saw of Mario, the maitre d' and the chef each had him by an arm and they were carrying him out the back door.
Oh, dear.
So, just give him the $60 and put him on the bus.
Honey, I don't think he's ever gonna believe that he should get all this money for just one night's work.
Look, Lucy, he thought that America was a great country.
Well, just tell him that it's a little greater than he thought it was.
Maybe I can get another idea for a job I can't afford any more of your ideas.
Oh, honey Now, make up your mind.
It's either "Arrivederci, Mario or "Good-bye, Lucy.
"  Oh, hi, Mario.
Buon giorno, Senora.
Um, Mario, I have good news for you.
Si, senora?
You're going to be on your way to see your brother today.
Ricky left your pay with me.
My-my pay?
Yeah, for last night at the club.
I can't take the money.
Why not?
It's your pay.
No.
Last night, I'm a-get fire.
No, Mario.
You didn't get a-fire.
Yes, I'm a-get fire.
Mario, I think you misunderstood.
Ricky said that you Please, Senora Ricardo, my English is not so pretty good, but in my country, when two men grab me, push me to the door and kaploopa, I'm a-fire!
Well, look, Mario, will you accept this money as a friendly gesture from our country to yours?
Grazie a molto.
No.
How are you going to get to see your brother?
I got good news, too.
I got another job.
Another job?
Si.
I was taking a walk.
I pass by a pizza restaurant.
In the window, I see a sign that says, "somebody to make pizza.
" That's me.
I go inside, I get the job.
Well, that's just wonderful.
And now I stay three more days, make enough money to go see my brother Dominic in San Francisco.
Three more days and nights.
Uh, excuse me.
Uh, sit down, Mario.
Grazie, grazie.
Could I see you in the kitchen for a minute?
Ethel, how'd you like to play a new game called "hide the houseguest"?
Mario.
Yeah, he's going to be here three more days.
Well, you see, he got another job after Ricky told me to get rid of him.
So, now if Ricky finds him here, he'll blow his Cuban cork!
Nice to be alone, huh?
Sure is.
Well, let's see now.
Mario's been gone for two days.
He should be halfway to San Francisco.
He should be.
Well, I gotta go to work, dear.
I'll see you later.
All right, sweetheart.
Good-bye.
Bye, doll.
Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes?
Bureau of Immigration.
Do you know a Mario Orsatti?
Come in.
Yes, sir.
Why?
Is he here?
Here?
No, he isn't here.
Anything wrong?
I understand for the past two days, he's been working at Martinelli's Pizza Parlor.
That's right.
Well, I was just over there, and it isn't opened yet.
No, not now.
Well, you see, Mario Orsatti entered this country on a visitor's visa.
Visitors are not allowed to work.
So, if your friend has violated the law, he may have to be deported.
Deported?
Oh, you couldn't do a thing like that.
Oh, oh, Mario didn't know he was breaking the law.
Honest, he didn't, and I didn't either.
You see, he was just working to get a little money so he could go visit his brother in San Francisco, and that's the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me, Your Honor.
We try to be lenient in these cases.
However, Mrs. Ricardo, under no circumstances is Orsatti to continue working.
Even for one more day?
Not without a work permit.
And it'll take him at least 90 days to get one.
I, uh, trust that you'll see he'll get this information?
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I'll, I'll tell him, and thank you, sir.
That's quite all right.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Ethel, Ethel, could I see you in the kitchen for a moment, please?
Please!
This time Mario go in the kitchen.
Okay.
What's up?
We're in a terrible jam.
A man from the Immigration Bureau just told me that if Mario works one more day, he's gonna Deported!
be deported.
Yeah, it's the law.
Visitors can't work without a permit.
So we can't let him go back to that pizza place.
Lucy!
If Mario ever finds out that he broke the law he won't even accept the two days salary that's coming to him.
So we mustn't let him know.
Well, how are we gonna get his money?
Well I could go down and pick it up if you'll stay with Little Ricky when he comes home from school.
I will.
Let's see now, he's got two days salary coming.
Bus fare I'll make up the rest out of my allowance.
That's good.
Mario doesn't have to know anything about it.
Okay, all right.
Uh, Mario?
Ma Si, senora?
Uh, Mario Uh, Mr. Martinelli just called and said that-that you don't have to go to work today.
No work?
How come no work?
Well, um it's a new labor law.
Uh, you see, when you, when you start a new job, you work two days, and then you get the third day off with pay.
That's-a the law?
Yep.
What's the name of that new law, Ethel?
I don't know.
You're the labor expert around here.
It's called the, um "The Taft-Hartley Visitors From Italy "Who Work In Pizzerias Get Every Third Day Off Amendment.
" My goodness.
America, she's a great country.
Yes.
Uh, Mario, as long as you don't have to go to work, why don't you relax.
Just sit around and rest up for your bus trip tomorrow, huh?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
And I'll go down and pick up your pay.
Oh, you such lovely people.
Table, senora?
Uh, I'd like to see Mr. Martinelli, please.
Si, senora.
I'll get him.
You wanted to see me?
Mr. Martinelli?
Yes.
Mr. Martinelli, I'm Mrs. Ricardo, where Mario is staying?
Yes?
Well, Mario is very sick and he won't be able to come back and work anymore.
So, I came over to pick up his two days salary.
Oh, no.
What do you mean "Oh, no"?
I made a deal with Mario to work three days.
He works three days or no pay.
Well, that doesn't seem very fair.
Look, the pizza chef is getting off in five minutes.
If Mario is not here to relieve him, no pay.
Uh, uh, Mr. Martinelli, uh, if I, if I could find a substitute for Mario, will you pay the money?
Well, it all depends.
Who are you going to get?
Well, um I know a pizza specialist.
Who?
Me.
You?
Yes.
You know how to make pizza?
Yes.
Yes, I majored in pizza in my high school cooking class.
Yeah, I make all kinds.
Uh, you see, people from Rome write me for my pizza recipe.
I'll give you a cap and an apron.
Two pizzas.
Here you are, Miss.
Thank you.
One pizza, mushroom and sausage!
Oh, I'm a little rusty.
Hurry up with my pizza!
Oh, he's wonderful, isn't he?
Oh, he's sweet.
LITTLE  Hi, Daddy.
Hi, son.
Where's Lucy?
Oh, Ricky, let's go over to your apartment and discuss it.
She's not there.
Come on.
What's the matter with you?
Hello, Senor Ricardo!
Hello, Mario.
Mario?
What are you doing here?
It's my day off.
Your day off?
Come on, Mario.
It's our turn in the kitchen.
Our turn in the kitchen!
Come on, come on.
Ethel!
Come here.
Start back at the beginning and tell me the whole story.
You're not gonna like it.
Ethel!
What do you think you're doing?
Well?
No speak-a de English.
How could you?
After todas estes cosas que te dije I was only trying to help Mario.
te di sesenta pesos para que se pusiera el hombre  Wait.
Un momento, estoy hablando con la senora aqui.
Look what you!
Get out!
Get out!
You're fired!
Estupida!
Just a minute!
You can't talk that way to my wife!
Ah, now, just one minute!
Brother!
This fiasco will cost Ricky a fortune: bus fare, cleaning bill for the entire wedding party down at the club, broken dishes, burned-out pizza oven.
I know exactly what it cost: $210.33.
Ricky did everything but tattoo the number on my chest.
Hi.
Well, that's that.
You get him on the bus?
Yep.
He's on his way to San Francisco.
I stayed there until the bus pulled out.
Senor Ricardo?
Yes?
Excuse me.
Come in.
Come in.
They tell me Mario is staying here.
Well, Mario was here, but he's on his way to California.
California?
Yes.
He found out that his brother Dominic moved to San Francisco.
Mama-mia!
But I am his brother Dominic!
You're You!
Dominic!
I no move to San Francisco.
I just go stay with my sick friend Sam Francesco.
Oh, no!

{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
"Off to Florida"    Hi, honey.
Hi.
What are you ringing the bell for?
I couldn't find my key.
Don't tell me you lost your key again.
Certainly not.
I haven't lost it.
I just couldn't find it.
That's the third key that you've lost in one month.
Now, honey, let's not fight.
You're leaving tonight.
We're going to be separated for three whole days.
Let's not spoil our last few hours together.
All right, all right.
Hi, Mommy.
Hello, sweetie pie.
Well, what have we here?
I caught a fish.
Well, I'll say you did.
You're getting ready for Florida, huh?
Uh-huh.
Mommy?
What, darling?
Why aren't you going fishing with us?
Well, just the men in the family are going fishing, honey.
You and Uncle Fred and Daddy are going.
Mommy and Aunt Ethel are going to meet you down there in about three days.
Oh, boy!
We're gonna have fun!
You bet you're gonna have fun.
Say, you bought a lot of stuff, didn't you?
Well, honey, you don't want me to look tacky.
After all, you and your band are appearing at the Eden Roc Hotel.
Well, well.
Honey, I bought you a lot of things for Florida, too.
Look at this.
See?
You wear this on the boat.
There you are, Commodore.
Hey, that's cute.
Hey, look, Ricky.
Mommy bought you a bathing suit.
That's mine.
Yours?
Relax.
It stretches when it's on.
See that it does.
Ricky, look at this, honey.
For a great big boy who's going on a trip with his daddy, he has just got to have a wallet.
Oh, boy!
Thanks.
What's it for?
Oh, well, honey, it's to keep things in.
You know, like money and pictures and valuable things that you don't want to lose.
See?
It's just like Daddy's.
Just like Daddy's, there won't be money in it.
Oh, push-tush.
Well, let me see now.
You're going on the Sunshine Limited.
You leave Penn Station Thursday at We'll meet you at the station in North Miami.
Okay.
Now, make sure that you put these in a place that you don't lose them.
Honey, sometimes you treat me just like a child.
Have I ever lost any train tickets before?
Yes.
Have I ever lost any train tickets to Florida before?
We've never been to Florida before.
There you are.
Look, from here on, they're your responsibility.
Well, honey, don't worry about them.
I'm going to put them right over here where I know where they are.
Okay.
There they are!
Well, maybe they'd be a lot safer over there.
Yeah.
If I ever lost them, I'd never hear the end of it.
Maybe you'd better use my wallet, Mommy.
Oh, no, honey.
Now, that's just for you.
I'll leave them right here in the desk.
I know they'll be perfectly safe in there.
Well, maybe there's a better place.
Let's see.
Good morning.
Hi.
What's the matter?
Now, Ethel, don't get panicky.
Now, Ethel, don't get panicky.
I'll find them.
Lucy!
Don't tell me you've lost our train tickets.
Don't get panicky, Ethel.
Ethel?
What?
Get panicky.
Oh, Lucy, of all the stupid things to do.
Oh, if Ricky finds out about this, he'll kill me.
Not this time he won't.
I intend to do the job myself.
Now, Ethel, don't get excited.
Look, all I have to do is call him on the telephone and tell him to wire me some more money.
Oh, yeah, that'll be great, except for one thing.
What's that?
They're out on a boat where they can't be reached.
Oh, darn it.
Honestly, Lucy.
Well, maybe we have enough to buy two more train tickets.
How much money did Fred leave you?
$18 and a half a sheet of Green Stamps.
Well, let's see now.
I have $32 and 24 cents.
That's over $50.
That's not nearly enough for two train fares to Florida.
Oh.
Well, um is it enough for one train fare and and one half-fare for a very large, blond, chubby child?
It is not.
Well, maybe one of us could go.
Which one?
The one of us that that has a little child down there that needs her?
Oh, no, you don't.
Either we both go to Florida or nobody goes.
All right, all right.
There must be some way for both of us to get down there.
Okay.
How?
Well I know!
By sharing a ride!
Sharing a ride?
Sure.
In a car.
You know, people are always looking for passengers to share the cost of gas and stuff.
Here they are.
Now, let's see.
Here's one.
La-la-la-la!
Mrs. Ricardo, you were right.
You two don't take up any more room than one.
No, it's, it's really quite roomy.
Isn't it, Ethel?
Oh, roomy isn't the word for it.
In fact, the word for it is cramped.
Mrs. Grundy, uh, I'm getting a little hungry.
So am I. After all, we have been on the road since 6:30 this morning.
Well, we've got to push on if we're going to get to Florida in Well, I know, but it's 1:30 already, and don't you think we'd better start looking for a place to eat?
We can't stop and dawdle for things like lunch.
Well, aren't you ever gonna stop and eat?
Oh!
Didn't I tell you to pack a lunch?
No, you didn't tell us to pack a lunch.
We thought we'd stop along the road.
All you'll find on the road are hot dog and hamburger stands.
Well, what's that you're eating?
It's a watercress sandwich.
Well, I guess you wouldn't find too many watercress sandwich stands along the road.
Care to try one?
No, I don't I'd love to!
Help yourself.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you!
Oh boy.
There you are, Lucy.
Like it?
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
Very tasty if you like buttered grass.
I love buttered grass.
All right.
Beddy-bye, everyone.
What are we stopping here for?
I don't see any motel.
Who needs a motel?
What do you mean?
Didn't I tell you to bring a sleeping bag?
No, you didn't tell us to bring a sleeping bag.
Look, Mrs. Grundy, if there's anything else you forgot to tell us, please tell us now.
Listen to me, Missy.
If you're going to get testy, you can just get out and walk the rest of the way.
You've got our money.
Exactly.
Nighty-night!
Well, uh, where are we supposed to sleep?
Well, the car is very comfortable.
Let's see, now.
It's, uh, it's 12:30.
I'd like to be on the road at 4:00 in the morning.
Yoo-hoo!
You want the upper or the lower?
And now for your early morning edition of the news.
Evelyn Holmby, gray-haired hatchet murderess whose spectacular escape from the New York State Prison for Women three days ago astounded the nation, is still at large.
Police are tracking down reports that    Where are we?
South Carolina.
What happened to North Carolina?
Hey, we must have traveled over 200 miles this morning.
Sure have.
I always take the back roads.
You make much better time on them.
Oh.
Oh.
What's that?
What's that?
Oh!
Oh, boy!
She's flat all right.
Whew!
She sure is.
Flat as a pancake.
Please.
Do you have to mention food?
Well, I guess this is a chance for me to catch a little catnap.
A nap?
Now?
Who's gonna change the tire?
Well, after all, I've been doing all the driving.
I'm sure you two wouldn't mind changing a tire.
You'll find everything you need in the trunk.
I hope we find a mechanic back there.
I don't know anything about changing a tire.
I do.
I watched Ricky and Fred on our trip to California.
It's a cinch.
It is?
Whew!
Well, she's got a lot of gadgets in here.
Yep.
There's a hammer.
Here's sort of a bent-looking thing.
Yeah.
Here's a a hatchet.
I wonder what she does with this.
: Oh, didn't I tell you to bring a hatchet along?
We might have to chop our way through the Everglades.
I got to get this tire out of here.
Okay.
There.
Now, let's see.
You'd better get the jack out of the back.
All right.
Oh, dear.
Lucy What?
what does a jack look like?
Oh, Ethel, you're such a dumb bunny.
Anybody knows what a jack looks like.
It's a It's a with a Lucy.
What?
I don't see any with a back here.
Oh, Ethel.
There it is.
That isn't a with a All right, so it's a with a That's it, huh?
It couldn't be anything else.
Gosh, you're smart.
I'm not so smart.
I'm just observant.
What do you do now?
Put it under the car and pump it up.
Oh.
Where under the car do you put it?
Just anywhere.
Oh, dear.
There.
Now.
Is it moving?
Not a bit.
Come here and help me.
Okay.
What do I do now?
Now just pump steady.
Just-just steady.
Okay.
There.
Now.
Oh!
Now it's getting harder.
Yeah.
Is it supposed to do that?
: No, it isn't supposed to do that.
It's her fault for having such thin fenders.
What do we do now, Lucy?
Let the jack down.
Let it down, huh?
Good heavens.
Okay.
All right.
Not yet.
Not yet.
There.
Now we got it.
Getting it?
Yeah.
There.
She'll never know the difference.
Lucy.
What?
You must have put the jack in the wrong place.
No kidding.
There.
Now it's off the ground.
Oh, good.
Hey, look, Lucy!
What?
It's not flat anymore.
Oh, dear.
Mira que cosa loca la goma esta!
Mira que cosa loca la goma esta!
What are you doing that for?
That's what Ricky always does when he changes a tire.
Mira que cosa loca la goma esta!
See?
It works.
Hey, no wonder it wouldn't come off.
It's screwed on.
Oh, yeah.
Well, maybe that's what this thing is for.
You think so?
Yeah.
See?
It's all groovy.
Oh.
Okay.
Oh!
Lucy!
Whoa!
Lucy!
Oh!
Oh, honey You'd better hold the tire.
Yeah, I'd better hold it, huh?
Good girl.
Hey, how about this?
We changed a tire all by ourselves, huh, girl?
That's something, huh?
Yeah.
Too bad we can't tell Ricky and Fred about it.
They'd never believe it anyway.
They wouldn't, would they?
No.
Well, there we are.
Okay.
I would say that is a good job well done.
What happened?
!
Lucy, we put the same tire back on we took off.
No!
Mira que cosa loca la goma esta!
Oh, it's five minutes to 4:00.
Lucy, did you sleep at all?
Who can sleep with all that noise?
Sounds like feeding time in a pet shop.
Wouldn't you know she'd park us right in the middle of the Everglades.
Maybe some music will lull us to sleep.
Well, let's try it.
Okay.
Now here's the latest bulletin on the Evelyn Holmby case.
Police have definitely established that Evelyn Holmby, famous gray-haired hatchet murderess who escaped from New York State Prison Thursday, is heading south in a cream-colored convertible coupe.
Stand by for further bulletins.
And now back to our recorded music.
What did you turn it off for?
Did you hear what he said?
Yeah.
So what?
Which way are we heading?
South.
Exactly.
Gray-haired Cream-colored convertible Oh, Lucy, that's just a coincidence.
But think.
It all fits.
Likes to drive in the dark.
Won't stop at motels.
Uses back roads.
Just why do you suppose, she uses back roads?
She told us.
To save time.
Oh, sure.
She uses back roads to avoid the police.
Oh, Lucy, I don't believe it.
The woman they're looking for is a hatchet murderess.
She doesn't look like a Hatchet!
Hatchet!
We're just jumping to conclusions.
She brought that hatchet along to, uh to, uh To what?
Chop watercress?
!
Ethel, that woman definitely has a criminal face.
She's really that Evelyn Holmby the police are looking for.
No!
Yes!
So we got to make a break for it.
Come on.
In the middle of a swamp?
What difference does it make?
Come on, let's get out of here.
Up!
What do we do now?
I don't know, but whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Fall asleep?
Oh!
Well, it won't be long now.
That winds up the news from Washington today.
And here's the latest bulletin on Evelyn Holmby, escaped hatchet murderess.
Police have learned that, before leaving New York, she dyed her gray hair red, and is heading south with a blonde companion.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, I was just admiring your lovely red hair.
Is it dyed?
Dyed?
Who died?
My hair!
Of course it isn't dyed.
It's very pretty.
Lucy, we got to call the police.
How are we going to get her to stop?
What are you two muttering about?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
I I I just remembered that I I I left the water running in my bathtub before I left New York.
I've got to stop someplace and call my landlady.
I thought you said she was your landlady.
Oh, yeah.
Landlady, my tub's running over.
I've just remembered that I I've got to stop, too.
I've got to make a a phone call.
There's a place up there.
Where's the phone?
No, let her go.
It's a very important phone call.
No, no, no.
Sorry, ladies.
That phone's out of order.
Coffee, ladies?
Coffee?
Yeah.
Yeah, let's have some coffee.
Let's have a cup of coffee, huh?
Have some coffee.
Here.
We won't need these.
Pfft!
Pfft!
Y'all must be from the north.
New York.
New York.
Yeah.
Heading south.
South.
All three of us- me, this redhead and this blonde.
You notice how gray her hair is?
Care for some more coffee?
Um Yes.
I'd like a second help-ing.
Help-ing.
When will your telephone be fixed?
First thing tomorrow morning.
Oh.
I've got to fetch something out of the car.
I'll be right back!
She's going out to get the hatchet!
She's the hatchet murderer!
She's the one that escaped!
Yeah.
The police are looking for her.
How can we get in touch with the police?
Now, calm yourself, ma'am.
They just caught that hatchet lady in Kentucky.
They did?
They did?
Yeah.
I just heard it on the radio 'fore y'all came in.
Oh.
You and your wild ideas.
Well Oh, I feel terrible.
Just terrible.
You're going to feel a lot worse.
She just drove off without us.
No!
Why do you suppose she did that?
I don't know.
Thank goodness she threw our suitcases off before she left.
A lot of good that will do us.
How are we going to get from here to Miami?
Well, how's your right thumb?
Oh Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not going to hitchhike all the way to Miami.
It's either that or walk, and I think it's about 100 miles.
Did you hear that, thumb?
Get going.
Oh, honestly.
I might have known, if I listened to you, I'd end up hitchhiking to Florida.
Well, we got here, didn't we?
Yeah, on a poultry truck with 85 live chickens.
You'll have to admit it beat walking.
A few more feathers and I could have flown.
Remember, now.
When the boys get here, tell them we came in on the train, and and they'll never know what happened.
I'm not sure I know what happened myself.
Here they come.
Oh, hi, dear!
Ha, ha!
Oh, I missed you!
Hello, honey.
How are you?
Hi, sweetheart.
Did you have a nice trip?
Oh, it was fabulous.
Just fabulous.
Wasn't it, Ethel?
Oh, that's what it was- just fabulous.
I don't think this warm weather agrees with you, honeybunch.
You're molting.
Sweetie pie.
I sure missed you, honey.
Well, thank you, dear.
Listen uh there's a couple of things that I'd like you to 'splain.
What?
Well, first of all, how come you got here an hour before the train?
Huh?
I just checked.
The train is an hour late.
It is?
Yeah.
And another thing- how come you got here without any tickets?
I just, uh, found your tickets in Little Ricky's wallet.
You what?
!
You said you wanted them in a safe place, Mommy.
Well, so I did, honey.
I did tell him that How did you get here?
It's a long story.
How did we get here?

{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
"Deep Sea Fishing"   Boy, what lousy luck.
Everybody on the ocean was catching fish but us.
Yeah, well, Fred, it's not important how many fish you catch.
It's the sport that counts.
You believe that?
Well, no but it helps to say it when you haven't caught anything in a couple of days.
I see.
Hey, there's a note here from Lucy.
"Ethel and I have gone shopping for beach clothes.
" What, again?
Beach clothes.
Beach clothes.
That's all they think about.
You know something?
I think I got an idea how to keep them from going shopping.
How?
Well, the next time we go fishing, we'll take the girls with us.
Are you crazy?
The fish aren't biting as it is.
Why antagonize them further?
Take your choice.
You're either going to take Ethel fishing with you, or you're going to let her run wild in the shops.
Well She might easily spend over $100.
Welcome aboard, Ethel.
I thought you'd see it my way.
I'm going to get out of these clothes.
And I'm going to take a little nap.
Ricky?
It's all right, Ethel.
He's taking a shower.
Come on.
Oh, Lucy when Fred sees all this stuff I bought, he'll kill me.
Oh He may faint first, but when he gets up off of the floor, he'll kill me.
Oh, now, Ethel, pull yourself together.
Come on.
Hey, hide your packages in here.
Can I, honey?
Yeah.
Oh, thanks.
I don't know what came over me.
I walked in that store and I saw all those beautiful things and I just got drunk with power.
I know.
I got a little plastered myself.
I spent $68!
Let's see.
That's my clothing allowance for the next eight weeks.
I spent $72!
How many weeks allowance is that for you?
I should live so long!
How are we gonna tell the fellas we bought all this stuff?
I don't know, but we're gonna have to break it to them gently.
Whoo!
Hey!
I think I'm getting an idea.
Well, encourage it.
I'm desperate!
How's this?
The next time the boys go fishing, we'll insist on going along.
Oh, Lucy, what are you talking about?
They'll never take us with them.
Exactly.
They'll refuse.
So?
So, we'll say, "Well, if we can't go fishing, we'll go shopping.
" And then when they come back, we'll show them all those packages, and they won't be able to say a word about it.
What do you think?
In spite of what I think, let's do it.
Okay.
When are you going to tell them we're going fishing with them?
I think they're going in the morning.
Let's tell them right now.
Go get Fred.
Okay.
Oh, hi, honey.
Hi.
How was the fishing?
Any luck?
Terrible.
Not a bite.
Oh I think our boat is a yinx.
Oh, ho-ho!
Of course your boat isn't a "yinx.
" Well, something is wrong someplace.
Come on, come on.
Oh, man, can't even get a chance to take a nap.
What are you dragging me over here for?
I told you!
Lucy wants to talk to you.
Well, we were just thinking You know, uh, Ethel and I aren't getting the most out of this trip.
After all, how much of Florida can you see from the inside of a store?
So, we decided that the next time you go fishing, we'd like to go along.
You want to go fishing with us?
Yeah.
Unless, of course, for some reason or other, you don't want us to go along.
Then I suppose we could spend some more time in those stale shops.
Oh, no, no!
We want you to.
Well, I think it's a wonderful idea.
You do?
Yeah!
You don't think it's a wonderful idea, do you, Fred?
Honeybunch, I think it's swell.
Fred, you know me.
You know how I get on water.
I'll be hungry and thirsty and cranky.
What's your excuse on dry land?
But what husband wants his wife along on a fishing trip?
We do!
And besides that, it was you who suggested it.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah, so I did.
And I think it's a wonderful suggestion.
You might turn out to be a great fishermen.
Yeah.
You might even catch something.
Yeah!
I'll bet they-they catch the biggest fish on the whole trip.
Right!
I'll bet we could at that.
I'll bet you could, too, honey.
I mean a real bet.
The women against the men.
We'll bet you that we'll catch a bigger fish than you two.
Well, you want to make it interesting?
Yeah!
All right.
How much you want to bet?
Uh, 68 and, uh  72, uh $140, plus tax.
Huh?
Well, make it 150 even.
That'll be, um, $75 apiece.
Lucy Uh, where are you gonna get the money to pay if you lose?
Out of our clothing allowance.
Lucy, could I see you in the hall for a minute?
Now, don't worry, Ethel.
Ricky, you were saying that your boat was a jinx?
Well, now, just so Ethel and I don't get jinxed, too, what say we have a boat of our own?
Okay with you, Fred?
Okay?
It's perfect.
: Well, I'll see that the hotel gets a different boat for you two in the morning.
Oh, fine.
Well, then, it's all settled.
Yup.
I'll go get dressed.
And I'll take another crack at that nap.
Yes, sir.
Are you out of your mind?
We don't know a thing about fishing!
We won't lose a thing, Ethel.
I have a plan.
Now, look I'm still recuperating from your last plan.
Oh, now, Ethel.
Now here's what we're gonna do.
Right after lunch, we're going out and buy the biggest fish we can find, and we're gonna have it here for insurance in case we don't catch anything.
Have it here?
Yeah.
Where will we keep it?
In the refrigerator here in the hotel kitchen.
Well, couldn't we get it in the morning?
You know how early they go fishing.
There won't be time.
Now, listen.
I remember seeing a pier not far from here : Oh careful.
Ooh oh Oh!
You and your hot ideas.
Well, was it- is it my fault if the chef didn't have any more room in the refrigerator?
Close the door.
Go ahead, close it.
Okay.
And was it my fault there's a convention here and he just made 2,000 ice-cream molds in the shape of a shriner's hat?
Oh!
Well, let's put it somewhere.
Moby Dick is getting heavy.
Well, we can't put it anyplace.
We gotta hide it.
Now, we gotta hide it before Little Ricky comes home from the playground.
I'd hate to have to explain this to him.
Why would you have to explain it?
Isn't he used to having tuna around the house?
Oh, be quiet.
Hold on a minute now.
I'll see if I can get it in this closet.
All right.
Oh, I can't put it in there with the clothes.
Oh, Lucy Even if you find a place to hide it, you can't just keep a dead fish in your room all night and all day tomorrow!
But we gotta hide it.
We can't let Ricky and Fred see it now.
Oh, great.
We got a hot tuna on our hands.
Oh Come on.
I know.
We'll put it in the bathtub.
In the bathtub?
Yeah.
Help me get ahold of this thing.
All right.
We'll pack it in ice cubes.
All right.
Hey, won't Ricky find it in there?
Well, I'll draw the shower doors around the tub.
Okay.
Come on.
All right.
Got it?
Oh!
Lucy?
What?
What if Ricky wants to take a shower?
One thing at a time.
We'll worry about that when it happens.
Here, let me have it.
Where are the fellas?
They're at the Seaquarium taking publicity pictures.
They'll be gone for hours.
Oh, that's good.
Room service, please.
Room service, this is Mrs. Ricardo in I'd like some ice cubes, please.
Oh how many?
About 4,000.
No, I don't need any glasses.
Well, you see, they're they're for the bathtub.
The bathtub!
I think I'd better come down and explain.
I'll be right down.
Come on, Ethel.
This explanation is gonna take two of us.
Okay.
You and your great ideas.
Buying a hundred-pound tuna in case we don't catch anything.
I didn't want to take any chance on losing that 75 bucks.
And you said the chef was gonna keep it down in the refrigerator.
I still think he was giving us a song-and-dance.
Whoever heard of ice cream in the shape of a shriner's hat?
Did you see the wild look he gave us?
Yeah.
You'd think somebody came to him with a hundred-pound tuna every five minutes.
Where are we gonna put this beast?
Well, can't we put it in your bathtub?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Oh, my God, watch out, Ricky.
Hey, wait a minute.
What?
We can't put it in there.
Why not?
Lucy brings Little Ricky back from the playground, she gives him a bath, she's sure to find it in there.
: Oh, that's great.
Let's put it in your tub.
No, no, no, no, no.
Suppose that Ethel wants to take a bath?
Listen, this was your idea.
You'll think of something.
Let's go.
Now, really!
You'd think the Eden Roc Hotel would have 4,000 ice cubes on hand.
Oh, sure.
All the guests must keep fish in their bathtubs.
I'm going to see how our "guest" is doing.
How is he?
He's resting comfortably.
Never mind.
Never mind.
I'll go take a hot bath.
Oh, hi.
Good-good-bye, good-bye, Rick.
Bye.
Hi, dear.
Oh, hi, honey, hi.
How was the Seaquarium?
Fine.
Wonderful.
We have to take Little Ricky there sometime.
Oh, yeah, that's good idea.
How was your day?
Fine fine.
That's good.
Where are you going?
I'm going to take a bath, dear.
Take a bath?
In Miami Beach?
Wow, with the whole Atlantic Ocean at your doorstep?
Oh, take a dip.
Take a dip, honey.
It's much more refreshing.
No, I don't want to take a dip.
I want this bath.
Well, well, look, honey.
Let me draw the water for you.
A wife should do those things for her husband anyway, don't you think?
While I'm drawing the water for you, uh, why don't you go in there and-and find Little Ricky's red swimming trunks.
I promised to take them down to him at the playground.
Would you do that for me?
All right.
Ethel?
Ethel?
Yeah?
You got a visitor.
Honey, I can't find those swimming What are you doing here?
Where's Lucy?
I didn't see her.
Wow!
That was a close one.
What are you talking about?
The fish.
Ethel had the gall to want to take a bath, and when she went in the dressing room, I sneaked the fish out of our tub and stuck him over there in your tub.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
What's the matter?
Ay Hi.
Where'd you go to?
I had to talk to Ethel for a minute.
Oh.
Uh I couldn't find the trunks.
Oh!
He's wearing them.
Oh.
Ethel, I thought you were gonna take a bath?
Well, I, uh, I changed my mind.
I thought you were gonna take a bath, honey.
Yeah, well, uh I changed my mind.
Oh, well, if you're not gonna bathe, I certainly am.
All right.
Oh, wait, honey!
You don't want to take a bath here in Miami Beach with the whole Atlantic Ocean at your doorstep.
Take a dip, dear.
Take a dip.
I don't want to take a dip.
I want to take a bath.
You can't.
Why not?
Uh the, uh, the the hot-water faucet is broken.
So, I'll take a cold bath.
It will be a terrible shock.
You can say that again.
The-the cold water makes you sick.
It does not make me sick.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah, I got to think of your health, dear.
If you want to take a bath, I insist that you take a bath over at the Mertzes.
I can't.
Why not?
Yeah.
Why not?
Okay, Ethel, let's go.
Honey, you can't take a bath in our tub with Tillie the tuna in there.
I know it, but I gotta have a bath.
I gotta get this fish off me.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna take an ice-cold shower in our tub.
Oh, fine.
How are you gonna explain to the fellas that our tub is occupied?
I'm not going to explain to the fellas.
I'm going to get rid of them.
And how are you gonna do that?
I have a plan.
I have a plan.
Well, I have!
What are you calling your room for?
Now, Ethel, just relax.
I know what I'm doing.
: Mr. Ricardo, this is the manager's office.
The manager would like to have you and Mr. Mertz come down to the office right away.
Thank you very much.
What do you suppose the manager wanted to talk to us about?
Oh, probably stuff about the band or something.
Oh, I see.
Just a minute.
What's the matter with you?
Just a minute.
Now, Ethel, everything's working out very nicely.
Oh, just peachy.
You're gonna take an ice-cold shower, and I've got a hundred-pound fish in my tub.
Now get this through your head, Lucy.
I am not going to keep that sea monster in my bathtub overnight.
All right, all right.
We'll worry about that after I bathe.
Now you go on back over there and guard that bathroom.
Fred will be back any minute.
Uh Ethel?
What?
You sure that fish is in your tub?
Sure I'm sure.
Hmm.
You don't suppose he could've swum through the pipes from your tub back to ours, do you?
What are you babbling about?
The fish is in our tub.
Oh, you poor little thing.
I knew if you kept up this mad pace, sooner or later you'd crack up.
Go see for yourself.
Lucy What?
Do you suppose we've both cracked up?
I don't know, Ethel.
Now don't panic.
Don't panic.
Don't panic.
Now we're gonna sit down think this out calmly and rationally.
Yeah.
Now look.
Um, we brought the fish up here, didn't we?
Yeah, that's right.
And then who took it over there?
You did.
I did.
I took it over there Are you sure that was the manager's office that called?
Sure I'm sure.
Oh, you must have misunderstood.
Look, Fred, I may speak with an accent, but I don't listen with one.
Yeah.
Where are the girls?
Lucy's probably still in the tub.
Honey, I locked myself out of our room.
You got the key?
That's funny.
Lucy?
Isn't Lucy in the tub?
No but guess who is.
Ethel?
No but you're getting warmer.
Quit playing games with me.
Who's in there?
Is the tuna by any chance a flying fish?
No, no.
What are you talking about?
Go in there and look.
Go.
Go in there and look.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Well?
Well, what?
If you put that fish in our tub, how did it get back into your tub?
Oh, I don't know, but I'm sick and tired of playing hide-and-seek with that fish.
Well, that makes two of us.
What do you say we just forget this whole crazy scheme of yours, huh?
I'm with you.
But how are we gonna get rid of our friend in there?
Well, we'll dump him someplace.
There's a big trash can in that service room.
We'll just pick him up and dump him in there.
That way, our hands will be clean.
Smelly but clean.
Well, what are we gonna do now?
Ethel, what say we get rid of the fish and call the whole thing off?
Oh, now you're talking sense.
But what in the world are we gonna do with it?
I don't know.
We'll get rid of it if we have to get it a room.
Get it a room?
!
All right, so we'll dump it down the elevator shaft.
Sheesh!
What are you doing with that fish?
Uh what fish?
That fish.
Never mind this fish.
What are you doing with that fish?
I asked you first.
Oh, yeah.
So you did.
While I'm thinking of an answer, you tell me what you're doing with yours.
Well, uh Fred?
What are we doing with this?
Well, I wa I was Well, that's not the point.
Ethel, why did you get that?
Yeah!
Well I know what you were gonna do with that fish.
You bought that fish and you were going to pretend that you caught it.
What a sneaky thing to do.
Well, you were gonna do the same thing, so you're just as snicky as we are.
Oh, you started the whole thing.
That's right.
I did not start the whole thing.
Yes, you did.
Yeah.
What do you I started the whole All right, all right, all right.
All right, let's admit it.
We're all guilty, but the bet's still on.
Tomorrow morning we're going fishing, but we'll all go on the same boat so there'll be no funny business.
Understand?
Mrs. Ricardo what do you want me to do with these Where do you want me to put them?
Four hours and not a bite.
Oh, be patient, Ethel.
Just keep thinking about all those new clothes we're gonna get.
Hey, Rick, I'd better check my bait.
Daddy, what if I catch the biggest fish?
If you catch the biggest fish, it counts for our side.
Oh, just a minute now.
He's as much my child as he is yours, you know.
The bet was the men against the women.
We get credit for anything he catches.
That's right.
You couldn't have had a girl child.
Oh, no, you had to go and have a boy.
Hey!
I got a fish on mine.
Hey, how about that?
Take it off, Rick!
Take it off!
Look at it, hey!
Oh, come now.
How about that?
Oh, you call that a fish?
Aah, your bait was bigger than that.
Yeah, well, go ahead and laugh.
Yeah, that's the biggest fish we've caught.
That's the biggest fish that's been caught out here.
That's right.
We're going back in 20 minutes.
That's right.
So far, that fish wins the bet.
Oh, we still got 20 minutes.
Yeah.
I'm going to use one of those live sardines in there.
That's a good idea.
Oh, I got a fish!
Oh, you got one?
I got a fish!
Put on your brake.
I got a fish!
What?
Put on your brake.
Hang on to it.
Yeah, I got it.
Oh, it's a big one!
Hang on, Mommy.
Whose side are you on?
Oh!
Hang on, honey.
Oh, that's a good one.
We're gonna win.
We're gonna to win, Lucy.
Oh, this has got to be the biggest thing that was ever in the ocean.
Come on.
Come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Ricky Ricardo!
What have you done with my fish?
!
Come on, help him up.
Come on, Rick.
Lost my big fish.
Come on.
Come on.
Give me your hand.
Oh Oh Give me your hand.
Are you wet?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, Rick!
Now, now, it's your fault for getting all tangled up in my line.
It's my fault for getting tangled up with you What?
!
Let's go back to shore.
Well, now, what about our bet?
We won our bet.
Oh This little baby just won papa 75 bucks.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot, Lucy.
Well, we can't win 'em all.
What's the matter, Rick?
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?
!
Let me help  What is How about that?
I caught a fish, too, Fred.
Hey!
Hey!
Bigger than yours.
Yeah.
That means that we won.
What are you talking about?

{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
"Desert Island" Lucy?
Yeah?
Fred just told me that he and Ricky are gonna judge a bathing beauty contest this afternoon.
I know.
How are we gonna stop them?
We're not.
We're gonna let them do it.
Honey, you've been in Florida too long.
Your poor little brain is sunburned.
Not at all, Ethel, not at all.
I just decided that for once, I'm was going to let Ricky do what he wants to.
When he told me about the contest I said, "Go ahead and do it, dear.
" You said that?
Yes.
This is the new, understanding me.
Oh, dear, this is quite a blow.
I was counting heavily on the old, conniving you.
That's all over, Ethel.
Look, what possible harm could there be in them judging a beauty contest?
Are you kidding?
Well, they sit out on the beach and ogle the girls, anyway.
This way, I-I-I figure it's supervised ogling.
Well, I don't like it.
And anyway, how can they judge a bathing beauty contest?
I thought we were going for a boat ride this afternoon.
There'll be plenty of time for that.
The contest doesn't start until 5:00.
Hey, where's Ricky?
They want us down at the pool to take pictures with some of the girls in the contest.
Well, uh, Ricky's in the manager's office.
Okay, I'll Rick pick up in the lobby.
I mean, I'll pick Rick up in the robby.
Oh, you know what I mean.
Yeah, we know what you mean.
What is he?
Hey, Rick, they want us down at the pool for pictures.
Yeah, I know.
I got wonderful news.
What?
I'm going to be in a movie that they're going to make down here.
That's great.
Come on, Rick.
The girls are waiting.
Yeah.
What kind of a movie?
Well, it's a documentary about Florida.
It's the whole history of Florida from the early days of Ponce de Leon until the present days.
Come on, will you, Rick?
Well, honey, how do you fit into that?
Well, I'm gonna be part of the present days.
Me and the band are gonna be playing right here, at the Eden Roc Hotel.
Come on, will you?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
The bathing beauties are waiting for us.
Will you look at the old goat?
He's practically pawing the ground.
Oh, never mind, Ethel.
I'll be right with you, Fred.
I just want to comb my hair.
Hey, Rick, can I borrow some of that fancy eau de cologne of yours?
Sure.
Thanks.
Eau de cologne, yet!
He hasn't used eau de cologne since Lillian Russell came to town.
Hello.
Yes?
We're looking for Mr. Ricky Ricardo.
Oh?
And Mr. Mertz.
Oh?
We're supposed to have publicity pictures taken with them.
Yes, down by the pool.
Are they in?
Well, um No, they're not.
Dear!
Well, didn't they know about the pictures?
Uh, yes, they knew about them.
But they had to go out.
And there's no telling when they'll be back.
Uh, sometimes when they leave like this, they don't come back for hours, days.
Weeks.
Months.
So if I were you, I- I'd find somebody else to take pictures with.
Oh, welcome home, dear.
Huh?
Mr. Ricardo?
Yes?
I'm Joi Lansing.
And this is Jill Jarmyn.
Oh, well, hello.
Glad to know you, girls.
How are you?
This is Mr. Mertz.
Well, how do you do?
Joi!
He's a regular little kewpie doll, he is.
We're supposed to have our pictures taken with you down by the pool.
In fact, the photographer's waiting for us right now.
Well, we were just on our way down.
I'll just grab some cigarettes, and we'll go.
I was so thrilled when I heard you were going to be one of the judges, Mr. Ricardo.
Oh!
I just adore Cuban music.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Me, too.
I must have seen your show in the casino a hundred times.
Well, isn't that nice?
I get such a boot out of it every time you sing "Babalu.
" RICKY : Well, thank you very much.
Shall we go, Fred?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.
Bye.
Tell me, Mr. Ricardo, is your accent real?
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, that was a nauseating scene.
: "Tell me, Mr. Ricardo, is your accent real"?
: "Oh, Joi, look.
He's a regular little kewpie doll, he is.
" "I get such a boot out of it when you sing 'Babalu.
'" I'd sure like to give her a boot.
And did the boys love it.
Did you see Fred's eyes pop out?
How about Ricky's eyes?
His nose looked like it was balancing two Ping-Pong balls.
Hey, what's happened to that understanding attitude?
Where is the new you?
When I saw those two mincing mermaids, the old me came right out of retirement.
Oh, boy, it's good to have you back.
Now, let me see.
How can we keep them from judging that contest?
Yeah, what awful thing are we going to do?
I don't know yet, but I got a hunch it's going to be a dilly.
Lucy?
Yeah.
I got here as fast as I could.
Oh, help me, huh?
Okay.
Ooh  Now, what's your plan?
Well, I told the boatman to only give us a half a tank of gas.
Half a tank?
Yeah, so when we get out in the middle of the ocean, the motor will suddenly go  and stop.
We'll run out of gas?
Yeah.
That's my plan for keeping the boys from judging the contest.
Oh, boy, that is a dilly.
That's a double dilly.
Does your plan also include a way to get back to civilization, or do we just float around in the Atlantic Ocean forever?
Ethel, how many times have I ever let you down?
Well, uh Never mind.
Now, when we're sure that they've missed the contest, I suddenly discover this and pour it in the tank.
The boat runs on lemonade?
This is filled with gasoline and this thermos is filled with lemonade.
And this is filled with sawdust.
Listen, do you want to keep Fred from judging that contest, or don't you?
Oh, yes, I do.
Well, all right!
I know he's an old goat, but an old goat's better than no goat at all.
Honey, I want to get some suntan oil before we go.
There's a little shop down there at the end of the pier.
Want to go?
Okay, let's go.
Okay.
Hey, girls, where are you going?
Gonna get some suntan oil!
We'll be right back.
Well, hurry up!
Yeah.
Daddy?
Yeah, son.
Is this the boat we're going on?
Yeah, that's it.
Isn't she a beauty?
Hold him, Uncle Fred.
All right, I'll watch him.
Here you go.
There we go.
Give me a hand.
Come on, Uncle Fred.
All right, thank you.
Well, as long as we got a little time I'll 'splain a few more things to you about boats.
I'm a landlubber.
'Splain to me, too.
All right.
Now, over there, see, in the front- that's called the bow.
And back here is called the stern.
So, that's the bow and the stern.
The bow and the stern.
That's right.
Say!
You're a regular skipper already.
This cruise-along is a dandy little boat, Rick.
Daddy?
Yeah?
I'm thirsty.
You're thirsty?
Well, your mommy said she was gonna bring some lemonade.
Is there any lemonade in front there, Fred?
Hey, I found a jug.
See if there's any cups in there, would you?
He's thirsty.
All right, here we are.
Now, Little Ricky, the right side of the boat is called the starboard side.
Remember that now.
The right side Hey, hey.
This smells like gasoline.
It does?
It's supposed to be lemonade.
Well, if it's lemonade, it's made from high-octane lemons.
Hey, you're right.
Yeah.
Is there another thermos up front there?
Well, I'll look again.
Yeah, here's another.
Well, that must be the lemonade.
Why do you suppose they put gasoline in a thermos jug?
Well, I don't know, but it's a very dangerous place to keep gasoline.
Well, that's just You should only carry gasoline in a safety can.
Yeah.
I'll take it out of here and leave it on the pier someplace.
Here you are, Little Rick.
You try that.
There.
That all right?
Yeah, Uncle Fred.
Well, I wonder what's keeping the girls.
Come on Oh, here they come.
Come on, girls!
Come on!
Here we are.
All right.
Hi.
Hi, hi, hi.
Oh, boy isn't this gonna be great?
Having much fun today, sweetheart?
Hi, lovey!
Sitting on a nice boat, going out in the ocean, huh?
And a nice day for it, too.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Here.
Watch this rope, huh?
Here, I'll take it, honey.
Over back there.
Watch it.
Okay.
All right.
Ooh, it's wet.
There we go.
Now, look at this.
Here we go!
Having a good time, honey?
Oh, just wonderful.
We love it.
How about you, honeybunch?
Oh, Fred, this is marvelous.
He's been looking at his watch all afternoon.
Fred, will you forget about that beauty contest?
Huh?
That's the farthest thing from my mind.
Say, maybe it is time for us to be heading home.
What time is it, Fred?
It's, uh, half past bathing beauty Uh I mean, half past 3:00.
Uh-oh.
What's the matter, Rick?
What's the matter?
I don't know.
The motor just stopped.
Well, do something, will you?
We haven't got much time.
Oh, what an awful thing to have happen.
What are we gonna do now, dear?
We'll have to take a look at the engine.
I can't understand it.
I checked every part of that motor, and I can't find a darn thing wrong with it.
Well, you got to find something wrong, Rick.
We only got about five minutes.
Oh, forget it.
We couldn't make it now, anyway.
Besides, we got a bigger problem.
If we don't get this thing started, we'll just keep drifting further and further out to sea.
Oh, are you sure you're too late for the contest, dear?
I'm positive.
We can't make it by now.
Oh, what a shame.
Yeah.
Look, honey, I-I don't know anything about motors, but, uh, maybe we're out of gas.
Out of gas?
!
Don't be ridiculous.
Well, now, Rick, it wouldn't hurt just to look and see, would it?
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll look and see.
I've been on boats all my life.
Since I was younger than Little Ricky, I been on boats.
I know that these boats don't run out of gas in an hour and 15 minutes.
Let me see   You're right.
We're out of gas.
Oh, no!
Now what are we supposed to do?
Thumb a ride on a passing halibut?
Well, now, let's not lose our heads.
I seem to remember hearing somewhere that they always keep extra gasoline on these boats, you know, just for emergencies like this.
Here, let me help me down, honey, and I'll I'll just take a look around, yeah.
Take a look around, honey.
See if you can find anything like that, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I read it someplace  My!
I know I have.
Oh, well, now!
Look what I found.
That's lemonade.
Ooh, I must have the wrong one.
Where's that thermos of gasoline?
Ricky left it on the dock.
Left it on the dock?
Yes!
Oh, for heaven's sake, Why would you do a?
How did you know that the gasoline was in the thermos?
Uh, uh, well, uh I'm waiting.
Tell me the story.
Yeah, Mommy.
Tell us a story.
A story?
Well, all right, dear.
Once upon a time there were these three bears- the mama bear, papa bear  Lucy!
Lucy bear!
Lucy!
Well, now, we only did it because we love you and Fred so much.
Didn't we, Ethel?
Uh Y-Yes.
That's why we did it.
That's why.
Did-did what?
Yeah.
Did what?
Well, uh uh uh Told the man that I only needed a half a tank of gas and then brought the extra gasoline along in a thermos so that when we were sure that it was too late for you to go to the contest and I think I'll try swimming ashore.
Of all the miserable things to do.
If I were the captain of this tub, I'd make her walk the plank.
Mommy, what's that?
What's what?
Over there.
Look!
It's an island!
Yeah.
Maybe we can drift close enough so we can wade ashore.
Yeah.
We can wade ashore.
Oh, what good would that do?
We'd still be out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Well, it's better than being adrift.
Yeah, it's better than being adrift.
Maybe someone would come by eventually and rescue us.
Somebody'd come by and rescue us eventually.
You see, gang, everything's turning out all right.
Isn't it, Ricky?
Isn't it, Fred?
Ethel?
Little Ricky?
I think I'll go below and put myself in irons.
Whoo!
Oh, boy.
Whoo!
Hey, I wonder if anybody lives on this island.
I doubt it.
Well, let's find out.
Call out, Ricky.
Hello there!
Try it in Spanish.
Huh?
This might be part of Cuba.
Oh!
Hey, they got some cacanuts here.
Cacanuts?
Oh, yeah.
There are a lot of cacanuts.
Well, it looks like we got the whole island to ourselves.
How do you like that?
Marooned on a desert island and it's got to be with, uh Fred, you'd better be nice to me.
We may be here so long that I'll start looking good to you.
Hey!
Look at this.
What?
Huge footprints in the sand.
So?
So this island might be inhabited.
Inhabited by whom?
Well, from the looks of these footprints, giant natives.
: Giant natives.
No kidding.
Look at these.
Oh, boy.
He must be a big one.
Now, if I follow them, maybe I'll be able to track him down and find out Well, it could have been a giant native.
Hey!
That's a speedboat!
Oh hey, Mister!
Hey!
Hey!
Mister, we're over here!
Hey!
This way!
Hey!
Hey, fellas!
Hey!
Come back!
How do you like that?
All he did was wave back.
Yeah.
Well, at least he was friendly.
Listen, Fred, maybe you and I should go out and see what's on the other side of this island.
All right.
Want to go out with us, Ricky?
Sure.
Come on, let's go explore.
You stay here and see.
Maybe some boats go by, and maybe you can get their attention.
All right.
Oh, boy, this heat is killing me.
You're either hot or you're hungry.
You're always complaining about something.
Well, that's because when I'm around you, I always have something to complain about.
Well!
How do you like this?
Stranded on a desert island.
You know, sometimes Lucy goes too far.
Well, there's one good thing about her.
What's that?
She makes me glad I'm married to Ethel.
It don't do me any good.
See if I can find anything around here.
It's the ocean on the other side.
Hey!
What's the matter?
There's someone in there.
Who is it?
It looks like a giant native.
Boy, you've been married to Lucy too long.
You come and look.
You stay here, Little Ricky.
Good night, nurse!
You hold them off, Rick.
I'll take Little Ricky and make a run for it.
Now, wait a minute, Fred.
"Wait" nothing.
It's uncles and little children first.
Now, there's got to be an explanation.
There's no natives on these islands.
Well, you tell him that while he's shrinking your head.
Now, Fred, I went to high school here He's right back of you now.
Hello.
Good-bye.
Hey, what's the matter with you guys?
Huh?
Aren't you Ricky Ricardo?
Yeah.
Well, I guess you don't recognize me under all the makeup.
I'm Claude Akins.
Claude Akins?
Yeah.
The actor?
Yeah.
Well, goodness sakes.
How are you, Claude?
Good to see you.
How are you?
Oh, this is Fred Mertz.
Hi, Claude.
Hi.
How are you?
Nice to see you.
Glad to see you.
This is my son.
This is Little Ricky.
Well, hi, Rick.
You know, I made a picture with Claude out in Hollywood.
Yeah.
What are you doing in Miami?
Well, I'm playing a native in a picture called The Florida Story.
We're shooting the scene where Ponce de Leon landed in Florida.
I'm in the same picture.
Really?
Yeah, in the present day.
You mean, there's a whole movie company here?
Sure, right over there.
Oh, for goodness sakes.
You're here making the picture, too, huh?
No, no.
I-I We ran out of gas.
We were taking a boat ride, and we run out of gas.
Oh.
You think we could borrow some gas from those fellows?
Oh, I'm sure you can get some from one of the skippers who brought us out.
Boy, are we lucky we run into him, huh?
You had us plenty scared a minute ago.
Yeah.
We thought you were the giant native Mommy was talking about.
Oh.
We thought you were a giant native.
Yeah.
Hey.
I've got an idea.
You got a little time on your hands?
Sure.
Why?
Well, our wives are on the other side of the island, see?
And we got a little score to settle with them.
So if you could do us the favor of coming over there Gee, I wonder what's keeping the boys.
I don't know, but after what you did to them, I wouldn't blame them if they never came back.
Well, at least we accomplished our purpose- we kept them from the contest.
You got to give me credit for that.
Listen, one credit hardly balances 15 years of debits.
Sheesh!
There's just no talking to you today.
Oh, I must look a mess by now.
Ethel Ethel, your nose is shiny.
Why don't you look in the mirror?
"Ethel, your nose is shiny.
" "Ethel, you got big feet.
" "Ethel, you're always hungry.
" What is this, "Pick On Ethel Mertz Week"?
Ethel, please powder your nose.
Oh, powder your own nose.
Ethel, I don't blame you for being mad, but there's a huge, ferocious-looking native standing right behind us.
You never give up, do you?
Ethel, please, look behind you and see if you see what I see.
Please?
Ho tasho!
Ho tasho!
He's trying to tell us something.
Maybe I'd better talk to him.
Well uh d- d-do you think you can understand his language?
If I can understand Ricky, I can understand anybody.
Uh uh hello uh, us friends.
What you want?
Oo-ta-goo-gah.
Oo-ta-goo-gah.

Well, what are you waiting for?
Aren't you gonna save me?
I'm trying to decide.
Ricky!
Hey, you, stop!
Attaboy, Fred!
You forgot one.
What's so funny?
What are you laughing at?
What's going on?
It's a joke, Mommy.
It's a joke.
A joke?
Well, some joke.
This is Claude Akins.
He's an actor.
They're making a picture on the other side of the island.
I hope I didn't hurt you too much, Mrs. Ricardo.
You didn't hurt me, but you scared the daylights out of me.
Oh, what a dirty trick.
What are you talking about?
You started the whole thing.
Hey, you better go and borrow that gas, if we're going to get out of here.
Yeah.
Hey, listen.
Why don't you all stick around?
As soon as we're through shooting, the whole cast and crew are going to have a beach party, a kind of a luau.
You're all invited.
A luau?
Well, I'd like that.
Yeah.
How 'bout it?
That's my favorite food.
Yeah.
Wonderful.
You see, honey?
I told you everything was going to turn out all right.
Yeah!
We've been looking all over for you.
The luau's about to start.
Oh!
Why, Mr. Ricardo and Mr. Mertz.
What are you all doing here?
Well, our boat ran out of gas.
What are you doing here?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What are you all doing here?
Well, they needed some more girls for the picture, so they brought us all out here.
Well, what happened to the contest?
Why, that's been postponed till tomorrow.
Come on, everybody.
Let's go to the luau.
You want to come with me?

Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz will be back next week at this same time.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
"The Ricardos Visit Cuba"    Oh, Lucy, isn't this exciting?
In a little while we'll land in Cuba and you'll meet Ricky's family.
Well, to tell you the truth, Ethel, I'm scared.
Scared?
Well, weren't you when you met Fred's family for the first time?
After marrying Fred, nothing could scare me.
Oh, I sure hope they like me.
Honey, they'll love you.
What if they don't?
Well, so they don't.
What are they going to do start another Spanish-American war?
Honey, stop worrying.
They'll love you.
Oh, just think you'll be visiting your relatives in a foreign land.
Sometimes I wish I'd married a Cuban.
That makes two of us.
Oh, go back to sleep.
Ricky, what are you going to say when you meet your grandmother?
Buenos dias, abuela.
Very good, very good.
What are you going to say, Mommy?
What, dear?
What are you going to say when you meet my mother?
Oh, um Bonus dies, madry.
Bonus dies, madry?
Honey, it's buenos dias, madre.
I don't think that's very nice, making fun of my Spanish.
Well, you've been making fun of my English for 15 years.
Well, that's different.
Spanish is a foreign language.
Well, English is a foreign language to me.
Well, the way you speak it it is to me, too.
I don't know why you're so worried.
After all, Ricky's mother loved you when she visited you in New York.
Well, I'm not worried about his mother.
It's all those other relatives- his aunts, his uncles, his nieces, his cousins, his great uncles, his great aunts.
Oh, now, honey, a big family's nice.
You don't know how big his family is.
Let's see.
There's Uncle Pedro, and Aunt Rosa, and Uncle, uh Rafael.
Rafael and Aunt Sylvia and Aunt Maria Pepa.
Uncle Jorge.
That's Uncle George.
Nandine, Manuel, Amberta Guillermito Menendez.
Who?
That's another uncle.
Guillermito Menendez.
That's another one.
Amparo Amparo.
Eduardo.
Eduardo.
He's the judge.
The twins.
The twins.
If you ask me you did not leave the island of Cuba voluntarily.
You were squeezed off.
Now look, honey, I told you that the only one that you got to worry about- and remember, the only one that is really important is Uncle Alberto.
Yeah, Uncle Alberto.
He's the head of the family.
I remember that.
That's right.
He practically raised me.
You make a good impression on him and you're in.
Well, I shall certainly try, you know that.
Now, I just want to warn you; it's not going to be easy.
Uncle Alberto's the one that wanted me to marry a Cu What were you saying, dear?
Oh, uh I- I was saying that Uncle Alberto is the one that wanted me to marry a cute, red-headed American.
You were not.
You were saying that Uncle Alberto was the one who wanted you to marry a Cuban girl.
I didn't say anything of the kind.
But you were going to say it.
How do you know?
I might not be able to understand what you say when you say it, but before you say it I can understand what you're going to say perfectly.
No wonder Uncle Alberto wanted me to marry a Cuban girl.
So, you admit it.
But I didn't marry a Cuban girl.
I married you.
Daddy, I'm glad you married Mommy.
Well, you and me both, partner.
And I'll bet that Uncle Alberto will be glad, too, when he meets you.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Sure.
Our clipper will be landing in Havana in 15 minutes.
Oh, dear, do we have to?
Honey?
Yes, dear?
Honey, did we have to have this family reunion our first night in Havana?
Couldn't you have made it some other night?
Well, honey, you know that we're only going to be in Havana two nights.
And tomorrow night, they've asked me to appear at the Casino Parisien here at the Nationale.
So, what other night is there?
Well, I was thinking about some night next year maybe.
Now, honey, you'll get along just fine.
Oh, I wish Fred and Ethel were going to be here.
Well, you know, we invited them, but they felt it was a family reunion; they didn't want to barge in.
Well, I feel the same way.
I think I'll join Fred and Ethel.
Now, Lucy, come back here.
Daddy, when is abuela going to get here?
In a few minutes, son.
Who?
Abuela.
It means grandma.
Oh.
I'm so nervous I can't remember my own name.
It's Mommy.
Thank you very much.
Oh, they're not going to understand me.
I'm not going to be able to understand them.
Now look, honey, they speak a few words of English.
You speak a few words of Spanish Oh, I've forgotten my Spanish.
Well, you took it in high school, didn't you?
Don't you remember anything?
I remember I flunked.
Well, look, all you have to remember is just a few words.
If I help you, maybe it'll all come back to you.
All right.
Say hello.
Hello.
No, in Spanish.
How you gonna greet them when they get here?
Oh.
Uh, bonus dies.
No, no.
No, dear, it's not quite that.
It's not bonus dies.
It's buenos dias.
Oh.
Bonus dias.
Buenos dias.
That's it.
Oh, but you can't use it now anyway because it's night outside.
You've got to say noches.
Noches.
Buenas noches.
Buenas noches.
That's right.
Good.
Now, how are you?
Fine.
I'm a little nervous.
Honey, in Spanish- how are you?
Oh, how are you?
How are you?
Now, don't tell me.
?
Como esta usted?
Hey, I could have used you in high school.
?
Como esta usted?
Please- Por favor.
Por favor.
Thank you- Gracias.

I want you to meet my family.
Pepe, Enrique, Rafael, Josefina, Alberta y Sylvia.
This is my wife, Lucy.
Bonus noches.
What did they say?
What'd they say?
They say they're very glad to meet you and that they like you very much.
Good.
And this is my son.
This is Ricky.
Buenas noches.
Uncle Alberto!
?
Como estas?
Hay esta.
Este era para ti y ahora es para el.
Ah Thank you.
Uncle Alberto, I want you to meet Ricky.
Buenos noches, Uncle Alberto.
How about that?
Listen, look what Uncle Alberto brought you.
This is my drum when I was a little boy.
Muchas gracias, Uncle Alberto.
What do you know about that.
He looks like a Ricardo.
Say, I got an idea.
Would you like to play the drums with me tomorrow night?
Oh, boy!
Okay, we'll practice tomorrow.
Alberto, quiero que conozcas a mi senora.
Uh-huh.
Lucy?
This is Uncle Alberto.
Hi.
What's this "hi" business?
Quiere decir "hello.
" ?
Como esta usted?
Es una muchacha muy bonita.
How's that?
I was saying, you're a very pretty girl.
Oh.
And where did you get that beautiful red hair?
Oh, I get it every two weeks Oh!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Uncle Alberto.
I'll buy you a new one tomorrow.
I'm terribly sorry.
Everybody let's have some punch, huh?
Un ponche.
Alberto, tome un buen ponche.
You look well.
Tu muy bien tambien.
Muy bien.
Muy bien.
You see, she was nervous.
You know, she was nervous meeting you.
Te debias haber casado con una muchacha Cubana.
But I wasn't in love with a Cuban girl.
You'll love Lucy when you get to know her.
You really would.
Dale una oportunidad.
I'll give her, I'll give her Very well, very well.
Honey, come on.
Come on.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I was so nervous.
I made a terrible impression on your uncle.
Honey, no, no.
Why don't you tell him it's an old American custom.
Oh, now- What?
When you like somebody, you break their hat.
Now, honey, I had a talk with him and everything's smoothed out.
Now, you just go over and talk with him.
Oh, do I have to?
Por favor.
Please.
What will I say?
Well, let him do the talking.
Oh, okay.
Uh, Uncle Alberto?
?
Si, querida?
Would you care for some punch?
Si.
Macho grasa.
What?
Macho grasa.
?
Que modo de tratar el tio son esas?
What did I say?
What'd I say?
What?
What did you say?
He asked me if I wanted some punch.
I said, si.
Macho grasa.
?
Macho grasa?
Oh, dear, it's muchas gracias.
You just called him a big, fat pig.
Oh, no!
Say you're sorry.
That you didn't know what you were saying.
Uncle Alberto Oh!
Oh, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry.
I'm terribly sorry, Uncle Alberto.
It will come right off.
Let me get some cold water.
It will come right off.
Honey, please.
Honey Lucy, sit down, darling.
I'll get a towel, dear.
My cigars!
My cigars!
He should have married a Cuban girl.
Now, honey, it couldn't have been that bad.
Well, I ruined his straw hat, spilled punch on his clothes, crushed his cigars, and called him a big, fat pig in Spanish.
Well, that's pretty bad, even for you.
After what I did last night Cuba may cut off America's sugar supply.
Oh, dear.
We've got to rehearse.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, where did you get that drum?
Uncle Alberto gave it to me.
Yeah.
It's the drum I used to have when I was a little boy.
Yeah?
Say, shall we tell them the big news?
Ricky's going to appear with me tonight.
Oh.
No kidding.
Will you be there?
Will we?
!
Why, we wouldn't miss that for anything in the world.
My whole family's coming.
I got a big table reserved.
Yeah, you better reserve one table for your family and one for me.
Oh, now, honey, what are you talking about?
After what happened last night, Uncle Alberto will never want to see me again, much less sit at the same table with me.
Now, that's not true.
Well, if the first time I met you I said awful things, spilled stuff all over you, and acted like a first-class nincompoop, what would you have done?
Just what I did- wait for my clothes to come back from the cleaners and then marry you.
Boy, he's got a memory like an elephant.
Come on, partner, we got to go to rehearsal.
Listen, after the rehearsal, I'm going to take him over to his grandma's house and then I'm going to see Uncle Alberto.
So I'll see you later.
Okay.
Adios.
Good-bye.
Adios.
Bye-bye, dear.
Oh, come on now, honey, snap out of it.
Let's all go shopping.
Shopping?
Again?
Yeah, let's go shopping.
There's something I want to get.
What?
A box of cigars for Uncle Alberto.
I found out where he has his made.
Maybe if I get some more for him I'll get back in his good graces.
Oh, sure you will, honey.
Come on.
Oh, look at me.
Brown purse, blue shoes.
Heavens to Betsy.
I'll only be a second.
I want to get my other purse.
I'm going to get my other wallet.
I left my money in this one.
Yeah, this is the place, all right.
Oh, look, they make cigars by hand.
Isn't that interesting?
Mm-hmm.
Hey, how about that?
Honey, while you're buying the cigars I think I'll go buy some more souvenirs.
Ethel, do you think I'm made of money?
Oh, I just want to buy a pair of those maracas.
Swell- then we can mambo all the way to the poor house.
I'll catch up with you later.
Buenos dias, senora.
Bonus dies.
What can I do for you?
I'd like a box of Corona Grande, please.
Por favor.
Aqui estan sus tobacos.
El mejor tobaco en Havana.
Ah, macho gra I mean, muchas gracias.
Quince pesos.
What's that?
Si, senora.
Oh, my gosh!
?
Que paso?
I forgot to put my money in this purse.
I have some friends right down the street.
I'll go get them and bring the money back to you.
No money, no cigars.
What are you talking?
Look what you did!
What do you mean, "what I did," for heaven's sake.
If you hadn't grabbed ahold my arm, I wouldn't have dropped the box.
Si usted hubiera traido dinero no pasa esto.
Now, you have to pay for this.
Well, how can I pay for them if you won't let me get the money from my friends?
You stay here.
Your friends come back for you.
But they're not coming back for me.
Oh, then I call the police right now.
What are you talking about, for heaven's sakes?
Why should you call the police?
Me espera ahi un ratito.
Ahorita regreso,?
eh?
Ah, Senor Don Alberto.
?
Como esta usted?
Muy bien, senor.
What can I do for you?
Well, I need some more cigars.
Tengo palmas Corona Grande, Panatelas lo que usted guste.
y me han dicho que ha comprado usted una casa en Santiago.
Bueno, una casa asi no mas.
No vaya creer que es una cosa del otro mundo.
Este es un tobaco excelente.
Tambien aqui esta   Mire usted, esto lo hemos hecho de un tobaco selecto para gustos delicados de la aristocracia.
?
Que le parece?
Ah, que bien.
Este es una cosa excelente.
Hey?
Donde esta?
La Americana loca que ha venido aqui.
La turista.
I didn't see no one.
Dice usted que ha venido.
Me ha comprado cigarros.
Se ha ido sin pagarme.
Y ademas de eso los ha roto y los ha pisado.
No hay derecho, pero Angelo, ?
has visto a alguien salir por aqui?
Maybe she went out this door.
No puede ser.
Senor Don Alberto, I'm sorry for this delay.
Don't worry.
I am waiting for my nephew right here.
Which one?
Ricky, the one that married the Americana.
Oh, el maestro que tiene una orquestra famosa.
Tendre mucho gusto en verlo.
If you think that Americana turista is bad you should meet my nephew's wife.
No!
Alberto.
?
Como estas?
Mi sobrino, Ricky Ricardo.
Mucho gusto.
An American ruined a whole box of his best cigars.
Si, senor.
Si, senor.
Americano?
Si, una loca turista Americana.
Si, imaginese que ha venido los roto se ha querido ir sin pagar.
Sin pagar, senor!
Disappeared right before his eyes.
?
Una loca turista Americana?
Loquisima!
Loquisima!
No sabe donde Alberto, I just remembered I got to be someplace in ten minutes.
Look at that big cigar they're making.
They don't make them like they used to anymore do they?
Aha!
That's the woman!
No, senor  Ladies and gentlemen, this evening, the casino takes great pleasure and pride in presenting a very special attraction.
Some years ago, a young boy left Cuba to go to America.
The only thing that he took with him was a drum full of rhythm and a heart full of hope.
He's back home tonight.
Let's give him a real great welcome.
Ricky Ricardo!
Pablo!
You see un hombre afortunado Which means you're looking at a lucky guy In Cuba, I'm a Cuban In the U.S.A., I'm a yank Wherever I am, I'm home, and I got you to thank You never see me homesick 'Cause from home I'm never away Wherever I am, I'm home In Cuba or the U.S.A.

Thank you.
Thank you very, very much, ladies and gentlemen.
You don't know how wonderful it is to be back in Cuba.
You know, I I left here alone, but I didn't come back alone.
I'd like you to meet my wife, a wonderful girl.
Lucy.
And I'd like to ask another member of the family to join me in the next number.
I'd like you to meet my son, Ricky, Jr. Say, "gracias.
" Gracias.
Now, uh, even though Little Ricky was born in America, I want to prove to you that there's a lot of Cuba in his heart.

{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
"Little Ricky's School Pageant"    Hello.
Oh, hi, Caroline.
Yeah, we got back Friday.
Oh, I just loved it.
Florida was marvelous.
Cuba?
Well, just bueno, bueno, that's all.
I met all of Ricky's family, and guess what, Caroline.
I learned how to do the cha-cha-cha.
Took lessons at the hotel.
No, it wasn't too expensive.
It came to about ten dollars a cha.
Well, it's, uh it's sort of like the rumba, only you, uh you do a lot more, uh  And then there's two or three times that you, that you Oh.
Hi, Mommy.
What are you doing?
Yeah, well, just a minute.
Caroline, I got to run now.
I'll call you back later.
Okay, dear.
Bye.
Oh, I-I'm just dancing, honey.
Hi, sweetheart.
Well, now, were you a good boy this afternoon?
Oh, he was just a doll.
He and Uncle Fred have been playing cowboys and Indians.
Lucy, if you've got this thing unpacked, I'll put it down in the basement.
Oh, Fred.
Oh, what's so funny?
Isn't he cute?
That's the way he used to look when he had hair.
Here, cowboy.
You'd better put that back in the wigwam.
Go on, honey.
You can take that anytime, Fred.
I finished unpacking before I went to the PTA meeting.
Come on, give me a hand, will you, Ethel?
What's the matter?
Can't you handle it by yourself?
: No, I can't handle it by myself.
Why not?
Because when I lost my hair, I lost my strength.
Well, if you expect me to help you, you just lost your mind.
Hi.
Hiya, Fred.
Oh, hi, Rick.
Hi, honey.
Hey, Rick, will you help me put this thing down in the basement?
Why, sure, Fred.
Come on, grab ahold.
Where's Little Ricky?
Oh, he'll be out in a minute.
Honey, here's Daddy.
Hi, partner!
Hi, Daddy.
Hi.
Hey, honey, hurry back, will you?
Because I want to tell you all about the PTA meeting.
We made some wonderful plans.
No, absolutely not.
"No, absolutely not" what?
I am not going to cook Spanish food for 800 people at another school bazaar again.
Well, it's not a bazaar.
It's a pageant, and it's called The Enchanted Forest.
Oh.
Oh.
Little Ricky's gonna be in it.
Oh, is he?
Yeah.
What's he gonna do?
I don't know.
They haven't assigned the parts yet.
Well, if, uh they haven't assigned the parts, how do you know that he's gonna be in it?
Well, it's being presented by the kindergarten and the first and second grades.
He's bound to be in it.
Oh, I see.
In fact, I assume Little Ricky will have the star part.
And why do you assume that he's gonna have the star part?
Well, my goodness, it's perfectly obvious to me that Little Ricky has much more talent than any other child in the school.
It should also be obvious to you that there are a lot of other talented children in school, and that their families probably feel exactly the same way.
Well, honey, it's only right that the most talented child get the biggest role.
Now, it isn't fair to our son to give him a stale, unimportant little part.
Now, Lucy, listen to me.
Hey, Ricky, wouldn't you like to go into your room and play with your trains?
No, Daddy.
I'd like to stay here.
Oh.
Well will you do it as a favor to Daddy?
Okay.
Thank you, partner.
Thank you, sweetheart.
See you in a minute.
Lucy, we know that the child is talented, but that is not the point.
It is much more important that he learns how to cooperate and to become a part of a group than it is for him to be the center of attention.
Well No, really.
We don't want him to think that that the world revolves around him.
We want him to learn that there are other people that count, too.
You know something, honey?
You're absolutely right.
You know, you're a regular Cuban Dr. Spock.
Well, thank you.
Then it's all settled, huh?
Yeah, it's all settled, baby.
Okay.
Come on, Fred, let's get this thing downstairs.
What?
Already?
Yeah, children sure love to have a snack when they come home from school in the afternoon.
Kids never seem to get full.
No.
I guess they burn up a lot of energy playing.
Yeah.
Well, I burn up a lot of energy eating.
Yeah.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Ethel.
Well, hi, there.
Hi, sweetheart.
Look at those rosy cheeks.
I bet it was cold outside today.
My sandwich!
Where's my sandwich?
!
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Oh, sweetheart, I'm so sorry.
There we are.
Honey, did you have a good time in school today?
No.
No?
!
No!
Gee, it reminds me of my schooldays.
Well, honey, what happened?
It's the old pageant.
What about the pageant?
Didn't the teacher give you a part?
Yes.
Well, then why the long face?
She just wanted to give me a little part.
Well, now, I think that's fine.
I don't.
Why not?
I don't want a stale little part.
Oh, dear.
You don't?
I should get a big part.
I've got talent.
Well, now, whoever told you that?
You did.
Where are you going?
I think I hear my mother calling me.
Little Ricky, darling, I want to have a talk with you.
Now, listen, honey.
Even though you might want to have a big part in the pageant, you must realize that the other little boys and girls in the school want to have a big part, too.
Now, the main thing is to make the pageant a success, isn't it?
So, honey, it's much more important for you to cooperate, and be a member of the group, than it is to be the center of attention.
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Yes, Mommy.
Good.
Now, tomorrow, when you go to school, I want you to tell your teacher that you'll be very happy to accept that stale that nice little part in the pageant.
Okay?
Okay, Mommy.
All right, sweetheart.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi.
Say, how about playing some bridge tonight?
Oh, sorry, honey.
Ricky has to go to a fathers' meeting at school.
And, say, the last time we played bridge, you said you'd never want to play with me again.
What happened?
Our television set's broken.
Stranded, eh?
Hi, Ethel.
Hi.
Honey, I'll be back about 8:30 or 9:00.
Okay.
What's the meeting for, Rick?
Well, it's a school pageant, you know.
Yeah, well, the parents are going to take part in it, too, and the fathers are getting their assignments tonight.
Yeah, they'll probably want me to produce and direct the whole thing.
Gee, it sounds like a big job.
Yes, I guess it'll be, but, you know, it's one of those things that they ask you to do that you have to do, you know.
Well, I'm very proud of you, dear.
You're such a good father.
It's nothing, honey.
It's a community project, and everyone should be proud and glad to do their part.
That's right, dear.
I'll see you later.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Oh, boy, you're married to a wonderful guy.
Yeah.
Hey, how about playing some three-handed bridge?
Okay.
I'll go get the dummy.
That meeting's taking longer than Ricky figured.
Well, you know Ricky.
When he's in charge of something, time means nothing.
Huh!
Mira!
Que quieren la cosa la gente.
Huh!
Se puede ofrecerle uno que voy hacerlo.
Y quieren que haga alli Y no me lo dan a mi nada!
Honey!
Honey!
What's wrong?
I'll tell you what's wrong.
What?
You know who they picked to produce and direct the pageant?
Who?
Clifford Terry.
Clifford Terry?
!
Yeah.
He's not even in show business.
He runs an orange juice stand.
Why did they ever pick him?
Because, during intermission, he's gonna give them free orange juice.
That's why they ever picked him.
What are you gonna be?
His assistant?
No.
His assistant's assistant?
No.
Know what they want me to do?
What?
They want me to be an actor with all the little kids in The Enchanted Forest.
Well, honey, that doesn't sound so bad.
It's probably a big role.
What part are you gonna play?
A hollow tree.
A hollow tree?
A hollow tree.
Eso es lo que quieren que yo haga.
Un actor como mi pasando un hollow tree.
Eso es lo que quieren que haga yo alla.
The only father in the whole school that is in show business, and they want me to play a hollow tree.
Mira que tienen cosa.
I've got a good mind to tell them that I don't want anything to do with the whole school pageant.
Daddy, you woke me up.
Oh.
I'm sorry, son.
I'm I'm sorry I shouted so loud.
Daddy?
What?
Why don't you want to be a tree?
Oh.
Well, I'm a performer.
I've been in show business since I was a I think you should be a tree.
You do?
Uh-huh.
It's more fun to cooperate than to be the center of attention.
You're right, son.
You're absolutely right.
I'll be a tree.
Oh, boy!
Daddy's gonna be a tree!
Daddy's gonna be a tree!
Well, I guess he taught you a lesson.
Just because you couldn't be the big cheese, you didn't want to play.
Don't you talk too much.
Wait till you find out what they want you to do.
What?
You are going to be the old witch.
Ew!
Oh, a hollow tree and an old witch.
Funny, huh?
And don't you two laugh either.
What do you mean?
Well, all the parents are busy in the production and direction end of this extravaganza, so I told them that you two would be very happy to take a part.
Oh.
Oh, no.
What did they pick out for me?
Oh, they got a dilly for you.
You're gonna be a frog.
Freddy the Frog.
Oh, that's really funny.
And you, Ethel, are gonna be the Fairy Princess.
Oh!
Well, if there's anything funnier than me being a frog, it's you being a fairy princess.
Hey, how come she's a fairy princess and I'm a witch?
Now, look, dear, remember, you have to cooperate with the group.
I don't mind cooperating, but this casting is ridiculous.
Just what do you mean by that?
Oh, nothing personal, Ethel, but anyone can see you look more like a witch than I do.
Well, I'm glad you didn't get personal.
Look, it's really purely a matter of economics.
What do you mean?
Well, they want to use the costume that they used last year for the Fairy Princess, and Ethel happens to fit it perfect.
Oh, yeah, last year.
I remember.
Jimmy Wilson's mother was the Fairy Princess and, oh, she's a Oh, you'll fit it perfectly.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, partner.
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Say, that bus got you home kind of early today, didn't it?
Say, what's this?
Oh, what have you been doing?
A note from the teacher.
"Dear Mrs. Ricardo, "The child who was to have played the lead in the pageant "can't do it because his parents feel the part is too big, "and he can't memorize all the lines.
"If you think your son can handle it, we'd like him to play the lead.
" Isn't that wonderful?
Wait a minute, honey.
Who are you calling?
I'm going to call his teacher and tell her we'd be delighted to have Ricky play the lead.
Now, wait a minute, honey.
I don't know whether he can handle a lead.
He's just a little boy.
Honey, he's got show business in his blood.
You can handle the lead, can't you, honey?
Sure, Mommy.
Sure.
Hello?
Hello, Miss Pringle.
This is Mrs. Ricardo.
Yes.
We just read your note, and we'd like to tell you that we'd be delighted to have Ricky play the lead.
Yes.
Well, thank you very much.
Bye.
Mommy.
What, sweetheart?
What's a lead?
Oh, dear.
"What's a lead"?
Come on, partner.
Time to go to bed.
Oh, not yet, dear.
I want him to rehearse his lines just once more.
Oh.
How's he doing?
Fine.
By tomorrow night, he's gonna be perfect.
Now, honey, let's show Daddy.
Little Suzy says, "Sometime, wouldn't you like to visit the Enchanted Forest, Billy"?
Come on, now.
You remember, honey.
All you do is nod.
That's right.
Lucy, I don't know, dear.
This is an awfully big part for a little fellow.
I don't think we can expect him to memorize the whole thing in a couple of days.
Oh, now, honey, don't worry.
He'll remember them all right.
Now, suppose that he doesn't remember them all right?
Well, so what can happen?
There will always be one of us- you or me or Fred or Ethel- close by to help him.
Now, don't worry about it.
Now, Little Ricky, this is the end.
Suzy is sitting there reading the book about the Enchanted Forest, and she comes to the end of the story.
What do we do?
" and after the mean old witch "recited the code of the Enchanted Forest, "the Fairy Princess waved her wand "and there was dancing and singing and everyone lived happily ever after.
" Sometime, wouldn't you like to visit the Enchanted Forest, Billy?
I said, "Sometime, wouldn't you like to visit the Enchanted Forest, Billy"?
Good.
Good.
Maybe, if we go right to sleep, we'll visit the Enchanted Forest in our dreams.
Look!
This must be the Enchanted Forest.
Isn't this a beautiful forest?
The most beautiful forest I ever saw.
I sure would love to live here.
Wouldn't you?
: I'd love to live here, too.
I'd love to live here, too.
Thanks, Daddy.
The bunnies!
The bunnies, Billy!
Weren't the gnomes and bunnies adorable?
Yes.
And here comes Hippity-Hoppity the frog.
Where?
Right over there.
Hello, children.
Hello.
Hello.
You must be Hippity-Hoppity.
That's right.
What's your name, little girl?
I'm Suzy Brown, and this is my brother.
Well, hello, young fella.
What's your name?
My name is, uh, um Huh?
I can't hear ya.
Billy Brown!
Oh, yeah.
My name is Billy Brown.
We were just saying, we sure would love to live here.
That's right, Hippity-Hoppity.
Can we live in the Enchanted Forest?
Why, sure, but there's one thing you've got to be careful about.
You mean the witch?
Yes, because she doesn't like little children.
So you've got to hide behind the magic tree when you see her.
Then you'll be safe.
We'll remember.
Thanks for telling us, Hippity.
You're welcome.
What's that?
Why, those are our friends the three wise owls.
It's the witch!
Hurry!
Hide!
Aha!
I see you, children.
You come out from behind that tree!
No!
Never!
This is a magic tree.
You can't hurt us here.
All right, then.
If you won't come out, then I'm gonna put a curse on your friend Hippity-Hoppity.
Hippity-bippity No!
Don't do that!
Don't hurt our friend!
All right, then, you come with me.
No!
Never!
Why not?
Do you know who I am, little boy?
I say, do you know who I am?
Sure.
You're my mommy.
Uh-uh.
You are the witch.
But I'm not the witch.
I'm Billy Brown.
Ai-yi-yi-yi.

Hi.
Oh, Ricky, that's a wonderful speech.
That's the one you're gonna make at the big affair tonight, huh?
Yeah.
Sound all right?
Yeah, it sounded great.
Oh, good.
I'm so proud they asked me to be the emcee, you know.
You should be.
Yeah.
Where's Lucy?
She went shopping.
I told her to go buy a new hat and a new dress for the banquet.
Would you say that again?
I told her to buy a new hat and a new dress.
In the 25 years I've been married, I have never heard that phrase before.
Oh, now, Ethel, I know that Fred is a little tight, but I know that if an important occasion came around, he would loosen up.
He wouldn't tell me to go buy a new dress if he was inaugurated President of the United States.
Hi!
Oh, hi, Fred.
Well, Rick, I see you picked up the trophy.
Yeah.
Isn't that a beauty?
Listen to this, Fred.
Yeah.
"4,961 victories.
" Isn't that great?
Great?
It's terrible.
What do you mean?
I didn't have a buck on any one of them.
Oh, Fred I didn't.
Well, hi.
Hi.
Hi, honey.
What'd you get?
What'd you get?
Oh, wait till you see, Ethel.
Wait till you see Oh, honey, you got the cup.
Isn't that a beauty?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Huh?
Oh, he's gonna be thrilled with that.
Yeah.
The engraver did a beautiful job.
Uh-huh!
Come on, honey, open up.
Let's see what you bought.
Okay.
Oh, listen, dear.
I have a lot of business to do uptown before I go to the banquet, and I don't want to lug that cup around with me, so will you bring it down?
Sure, honey.
Now, look.
The banquet starts at 7:00, so don't be late.
No, I won't be late, dear.
All right.
Come on, let me see your new dress!
All right, calm down.
You're acting like you never saw a new dress before.
Who's acting?
How do you like it?
Oh, it's gorgeous!
Honey, how do you like it?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Looks like a million dollars.
That's probably what it cost.
It was only 49.95.
To him, that's a million dollars.
Honeybunch, can I help it if I think of you as my dungaree doll?
Ethel, wait till you see my new hat.
Let me see.
It's the smartest thing you ever saw.
Come on, let me see it.
Let me see it.
Well, you really have to see it on to appreciate it, so close your eyes, everybody.
All right.
Open your eyes, everybody.
Close your eyes, everybody.
Oh, Fred, shut up.
Honey, it's adorable.
How do you like it, dear?
Well, it's uh uh   What are you laughing at?
Oh, honey, that's the funniest thing I ever seen.
I'll say it is.
Looks like you're wearing a fuzzy fishbowl.
Now, honey, don't you pay any attention to them.
It's divine.
Yeah, who cares what they think?
They don't know what's smart.
Well, I may not know what's smart, but I know what's funny.
And that's funny.
I don't care what you think.
It may interest you two hyenas to know that this is the latest style from Paris.
Oh, no.
I think it's the end, the very end.
The end of what?
I don't care what you think, I'm gonna wear it to the dinner tonight.
Oh-ho, no, you're not.
My wife is not gonna look ridiculous in front of all those people.
I do not look ridiculous.
You do, too.
You'll be better off wearing wearing that trophy on your head.
You wouldn't look half as funny.
Well, honey, all the new hats look like this.
Well, then, wear one of your old hats.
Wear an old hat to the banquet in front of Johnny Longden and his wife and everybody?
Look, Lucy, I don't care what you wear, but don't wear that.
Mommy.
I gotta go.
What dear?
I need a bigger box for my turtle.
A bigger box?
Oh, wait just a minute.
I'll get you one, honey.
Now, Ricky, I'm giving you one last chance.
Can I wear this hat?
I'm giving you one last answer- no.
Hey, this is a swell new house for my turtle.
Hey, stop him!
He can't put his turtle in that thin'.
Oh, Ricky, Ricky, honey, come here, dear.
You can't put your turtle in that thin'.
Isn't that funny, Fred?
Women will buy anything if it's in fashion.
They certainly will.
How would you know?
You haven't bought me anything since bloomers were in style.
Oh, good grief.
Ethel, if you're gonna play that same old tune on your player piano, I'm going home.
Well, twenty-three skidoo.
: I'll see you later, Fred.
All right.
Honey, I'll see you down at the banquet!
I gotta go.
Wait a minute, dear.
I want you to see the hat that I decided to wear.
Okay, honey.
Now, what do you think you're doing?
You said I might as well wear this, and I think I will.
Very, very funny.
Now, take that thing off your head and bring it down to the club in time.
Oh Good-bye.
Hey, you're cold.
That was a nice try, girl.
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
I got a lot to do.
Ethel Ethel, help me get out of this, will you?
It's a little tight.
Oh Ooh!
Ooh!
Oh, Ethel, I think it's stuck.
Oh, this could only happen to you.
What did you say?
This could only happen to you.
Speak up.
I can't hear in this thing.
: This could only hap Oh, don't shout.
It echoes in here.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Here.
Come here, honey.
Now, now, just bend over.
I'll, I'll get some Okay.
Ready?
: Ethel!
Oh, Lucy, it won't come off!
What am I gonna do?
Well, we could always butter your head.
Now, let's not be funny.
I gotta get this thing off.
Now, think.
Okay.
Oh, gosh.
Of all the things.
Are you thinking, Ethel?
Yeah, I'm thinking.
What are you laughing at?
Oh, you don't know how funny you look in that thing.
Well, this is no laughing matter.
Now, think.
Oh, all right.
Lucy, does heat make metal contract or expand?
I think it makes it expand.
Why?
Then that's it.
We'll stick your head in the oven.
In the oven?
!
Yeah.
The trophy will get bigger, and then your head will be free.
Oh, great.
Why don't you put an apple in my mouth and barbecue me?
I guess it wouldn't work, huh?
No, I guess it wouldn't work.
Hey, I got another idea.
It'd better be better than your last one.
Wait a minute now.
Just a second.
Ah!
Oh!
What are you doing, Ethel?
!
I'm trying to loosen it like the lid on a jar.
Oh, cut it out, Ethel!
You're giving me a headache.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Oh!
Boy, this is a tough one.
Ethel, are you gonna stay over here all winter?
Oh, Fred, come here and see if you can help us.
Wait till I tell the boys in my old outfit that the Kaiser is still alive.
This is no time for your corny jokes.
We can't get that thing off of Lucy's head.
You gotta be kidding.
I am not kidding.
Now, honey, honey, don't cry.
It'll only make things worse.
Yeah, it might get the trophy rusty.
Fred, what are we gonna do?
Well, we could get a silversmith and cut it off with a blowtorch.
A blowtorch?
!
Or whatever they use.
Then you can weld it back together again.
Oh, dear.
Can't you think of an easier way?
You'd better think fast, or you'll wind up wearing it to the banquet.
He's right, honey.
You haven't got much time.
Oh, no What time is it, Ethel?
It's 5:30.
Oh, I'd better call the silversmith, tell him to come over right away.
I'll do it, I'll do it for you, honey.
A silversmith, a silversmith  I'm not even gonna ask you how this happened.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Fred?
You can't give Johnny Longden a trophy all full of fingerprints.
Oh, sit down now.
Hello.
Is this the silversmith?
Can you get a loving cup off of a woman's head?
Huh?
Oh, well, she bought a new hat, and I thought it was Oh, never mind how she got it on there.
Can you come up here and get it off?
Oh, well, now, just a minute.
Lucy, he's gonna close his shop in a half an hour, and he says if you want him to take it off, you'll have to come down there.
Go down there?
How am I gonna get there?
I'll take you.
Oh, all right.
All right.
She'll be right down.
Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Huh?
Oh, you won't have any trouble recognizing her.
Lucy, his shop's way down on Bleecker Street, so you'll have to go right from there to the banquet.
Oh, oh, Fred, Fred Yeah?
Oh, ooh, Fred, run down and hail a taxi for us right away.
All right.
Just a minute.
Honey, a taxi will take too much time.
The subway will be faster.
I can't go on a subway like this.
Do you want to get to that banquet or don't you?
Oh, all right, all right.
Fred Is Fred gone?
Answer her!
Oh, I'm here!
Fred, Fred, would you stay with Little Ricky.
You can finish reading Cinderella to him.
Yeah, I'll go and get my specs.
I can hardly wait to see who that glass slipper belongs to.
Honey, I'd better go change my clothes, too.
I can't go on a subway dressed like this.
Well, if I can go like this, you certainly can go like that.
In my blue jeans?
Ethel, with a loving cup on my head, I hardly think anybody will be looking at your blue jeans.
Lucy, I have never ridden on a subway in my blue jeans, and I'm not gonna start now.
Okay.
Oh, boy, I look terrible.
What on earth are you trying to do now?
If I have to go from the silversmith's to the banquet, I want to wear my new dress.
Oh, well, let me try to help you, honey.
Uh, get over here.
Over here, Lucy.
I'll get up on the couch so I can I can pull it better from there.
Here, honey.
Right here.
Turn around.
Ready, set go!
Ahh!
Oh, Ethel!
Oh, Lucy, we can't get it up over that loving cup.
I want to wear my new dress.
Okay, honey, we'll take your dress along and you can change down there.
Oh, okay.
Say we'd better get a big hat or something to cover that thing in the subway.
A big hat?
Yeah.
You got one?
There might be one in the box in the closet.
Okay, I'll look.
Right there.
Stay right there.
Ethel, are people staring at me?
No, they're not paying much attention to you.
What'd you say?
I said they're not staring at you.
You'll have to speak up, honey.
With this hat and the cup and the veil and everything, I can't hear you.
: I said they're not staring at you!
Ethel, are you still there?
Yeah, I'm still here.
Why?
Well, I have a feeling you're trying to pretend you're not with me.
I'm right here beside you.
Okay.
What are you staring at?
Haven't you ever seen a beekeeper on a subway before?
Smart aleck.
Who was it?
Just some smart aleck.
What did he say?
He's going away.
He's going away.
Did he go away?
This is Bleecker Street, honey.
Here's where we get off.
Come on.
Ethel, are we on or off?
Ethel?
Ethel!
Ooh, pardon me.
Pardon me, sir.
Very sorry, sir.
Oh, excuse Pardon me.
Can you tell me where the stairs are?
Well, you'd better get off the train first.
I am off.
You're telling me.
Oh, pardon me.
Can you tell me where I am?
Yeah.
You're on Earth.
Pardon me.
Where am I?
Where are you?
What are you?
What's the matter with everybody?
Haven't you ever seen anybody with a loving cup on their head before.
No, I haven't, and I've lived in Brooklyn for 56 years.
Brooklyn?
Am I in Brooklyn?
Yes, you are.
Flatbush Avenue.
Oh, dear.
Would you do a favor for me?
Would you, would you make a telephone call for me?
There's something I have to tell my husband.
Yes, dearie, anything you say.
Oh, thank you.
If you would call Plaza 3-2099 and ask for Ricky Ricardo- he's my husband- and tell him that I have the cup, but I put my foot in it again.
I mean, I put my head in it.
J- J-Just tell him I have the cup and I'm on my way and tell Johnny Longden to hold his horses.
Hold his horses.
Oh, boy, that's funny, isn't it?
That's hilarious.
Now, maybe it's a little hard for you to understand, but my husband will understand.
Now, if you'll just call Plaza ask for Ricky Ricardo and tell him Lucy's on the way with the cup.
Oh, dear, I can't find a dime.
Just take what you need.
Thanks, lady.
Who's that?
Where's that lady I was talking to?
Where'd everybody go?
Maybe it's a sorority initiation.
Either that, or she played tennis with a sore loser.
Would a policeman be of any help?
Oh, good grief, no.
Don't get a policeman.
You know how nosy they are.
Always asking those foolish questions and then instead of helping after you've gone all explaining for a half an hour, all they do is just mess things up.
Don't get a policeman.
Thank you very Listen, if you could direct me to a If Uh, yeah.
Would, would, would you get me one of those wonderful, kindhearted policemen?
One of those guardians of the law in this great city?
One of those grand chaps that I Just what do, what do you think you're doing?

{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Good morning.
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi.
Say, I'm going to the market pretty soon.
You want to go with me?
I can't, I have to take care of Little Ricky's little friends.
Lucy, it looks like you're running a pet shop.
Oh, you're telling me.
Every morning I have to change the paper in Alice and Phil's cage, I have to feed Tommy and Jimmy their turtle food, and I have to water their little palm tree, I have to tidy up the cigar box for Hopalong Hopalong?
He's the frog.
Oh.
And I have to change the water for Mildred and Charles.
I wonder if this is the way Osa Johnson started.
Come on, Mildred, come, dear.
Come, Mildred.
Sweetheart, there we are.
Hey, girl, you're pretty good at that.
Well, Mildred's easy, Charles is the problem.
Oh, Charles, come, dear.
Charles.
Charles?
Chuckie-Wuckie.
Charles.
Charles!
I see what you mean.
I have several different techniques I work with him.
Sometimes I sneak up on him.
And then again, I just act nonchalant, you know, sort of stroll away, and, uh  And then when I think he's off his guard, I just  Listen, let me borrow your hairnet.
Oh, no, you don't.
Aw, come on, I'll buy you a new one.
Well okay.
Yeah.
Gee, I don't know why I didn't think of this before.
Oh, help me, will you?
Okay, I'll help you.
Over here.
Grab the bottom.
Okay.
Got it?
You got it?
Yeah.
I'll hold on to the net.
Now, you just tip up as far as you can.
Okay, go, fast.
All right, go!
Real fast.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
There.
There, now that was simple, wasn't it?
Simple?
Gregory Peck had less trouble with Moby Dick.
Well, that's life.
Children bring home pets, mothers take care of them.
Oh, now, who's the lettuce for?
Lunch for hopalong.
Okay?
: Okay.
Lucy, why do you let Little Ricky keep all these pets?
Well, I think it's important for a child to have pets, especially a city child, you know.
Gee, sometimes, I think we should move to the country so Little Ricky could have all the animals he wants.
Oh, Lucy, don't even say you might move away.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Well, frankly, Ethel, I don't know what I'd do without you, either.
Besides, with another vacant apartment, Frantic Freddy would blow what's left of his top.
I just went through three weeks of torture with that apartment next door.
Hey, speaking of our new neighbors, are there any little children Ricky's age?
No, it's a bachelor, a Mr. Stewart.
And he's an old grouch.
Why would Fred rent to an old grouch?
Well, to one old grouch, another old grouch doesn't seem like an old grouch.
And he's gonna pay to have his kitchen remodeled, so Fred doesn't care anything about his disposition.
Oh.
Well, I'm going on to the market, honey.
You want anything?
Well, not for us, but, uh, Alice and Phil could use some birdseed and Tommy and Jimmy could use some turtle food and Mildred and Charles could use some fish food.
Wouldn't it be easier if they just ate each other?
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Hi, Mommy.
Well, hello Oh, for goodness sake.
What have you got there?
A doggie.
Whose is it?
Mine.
Yours?
Uh-huh.
Is that one of Billy Palmer's six puppies?
Oh, now, honey, listen, I'm sorry, it's a very sweet little puppy, but I'm afraid we're not gonna be able to can't keep it.
Why not?
Well, for one thing dear, our house is too small for a dog.
But, Mommy, it's a small dog.
Well, I know, but he's gonna grow bigger.
Maybe our house will grow bigger, too.
Look, honey, I got all I can do to take care of your fish and your parakeets and your frog and your turtles But, Mommy!
Aw, now, honey, I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to call Billy's Mommy and and tell her that that we can't keep the puppy.
Oh!
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
You take your things off now.
Lillian?
Lillian, this is Lucy.
Yes, about the little puppy.
About the little pu Well, I, I I, I just wanted to say I just wanted to say thank you for this sweet little puppy.
Yes, well, thank you very much.
Good-bye.
Oh, boy, thanks, Mommy!
Well, honey, I can't make any promises, but we'll just have to wait until Daddy comes home see what he thinks, huh?
Okay, you go to your room now, sweetheart.
Okay, Mommy.
Aw.
Oh, hi, dear.
Oh, hi, honey.
Where's Little Ricky?
He's in his room.
Ah, Good.
I'll go say hello to him.
Oh, honey, before you do, come here.
We, uh We have a bit of a problem.
Well, what is it?
He brought home a little puppy dog today.
Honey, you know that he can't keep a dog in this apartment.
There's no room.
I know that, dear.
He already has frogs and turtles and parakeets and goldfish and lizard The lizard fell out the window, remember?
He didn't fall out of the window- he jumped out to get away from the crowd.
Now, look, honey, he cannot keep a dog in this apartment.
I know, I know.
Well, did you tell him?
Were you firm about it?
Well, not exactly.
Well, what did you tell him?
Well, I told him he'd have to wait till Daddy got home and let him decide whether we could keep the dog or not.
Oh, that's being firm.
Well can I help it if I'm soft and squishy?
Oh, he's the cutest little puppy.
Wait till you see them together, honey.
Look, dear, it's out of the question.
The boy cannot keep a dog in this apartment.
Now, the trouble with you is that you don't use enough discipline with the child.
I'll just go in there and tell him, "Little Ricky, you cannot keep a dog in this apartment.
" And that's that.
Huh, gee!
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, son.
Oh, is that your little dog?
He's very cute.
Hi, there, boy.
He likes you, Daddy.
Yes, yes, very cute.
Look, uh, partner, I have to have a little talk with you.
Now, I know that you're old enough to know that you cannot have everything that you want.
Now, it just so happens that Well, did you talk to him, dear?
Yeah.
Where you going?
Down to the basement to get a box.
A box?
Well, that little puppy can't sleep on the cold floor all night.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Hi, Rick.
Hi, Fred.
Hi.
Say, Fred, have you got a box down in the basement?
Yeah.
What for?
For Little Ricky's dog.
Oh, th-th-the dog.
Yeah.
Yeah, uh, uh That's what I want to talk to you about.
Ethel just told me about it.
Yeah.
You can't have a dog in this apartment.
Oh, it's only a tiny little bitty dog.
Yeah, Fred, we're not gonna let him grow very big.
But there's a "no pet" clause in your lease.
Oh, now, Fred.
Now, haven't I been lenient?
Didn't I close my eyes when you got the turtles?
Didn't I look the other way when, uh the frogs and the goldfish arrived?
Didn't I keep quiet when you got those two, uh, molting buzzards?
I've got to draw the line someplace.
That pooch has got to go.
Oh, Fred, you haven't seen him.
He is the cutest little thing!
One more word out of you, Ethel, and you go, too.
Ah, I'm afraid that Fred's right.
Oh, now, honey.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but if I let Little Ricky have a dog, everybody in the building will want one!
I don't mind being a landlord, but I'll be darned if I'm gonna run a pet motel!
All right, Fred, all right, we understand.
Mommy, Daddy.
What is it, dear?
I found a name for my dog.
Oh, what?
His name is Fred.
Fred?
Well, how did you ever happen to name him that?
I always name my pets after people I like.
Fred, where you going?
Down in the basement to get the box.
Come on, Rick.
Oh, wonderful!
Oh, boy!
Aw, now, you saved the day, sweetheart.
Hey, you know you kind of look like Fred?
Except you got a lot more hair than he has.
Oh Oh, no, not again.
What time is it?
Huh?
What time is it?
Oh.
He's getting better; he hasn't yipped in about 20 minutes.
Can you go out in the kitchen and see if you can quiet him down again?
Oh, now, you go; it's your turn.
I'm sitting this one out.
You go.
No, Ricky, you go.
You go- it's your son's dog.
My son?
Isn't he your son, too?
Not at 3:00 in the morning, he isn't.
Now, who's that?
How do I know?
Hello?
Lucy?
Yeah?
Fred.
Fred, what are you doing up at this hour?
What do you mean, what am I doing up at this hour?
The whole building's awake.
I've had six phone calls complaining about that hound of yours.
All right, Fred, I'll see what I can do.
Well, see what you can do!
All right.
All right, Fred.
All right, Fred.
All right, Fred.
Okay, okay, okay.
Listen, what am I gonna do with you?
Oh, dear.
Fred, I told you to go to sleep.
Do you understand?
Sleep, sleep, sleep.
Look at me.
Oh I'll sing you to sleep.
Now, come on, Fred, please, please, please, go to sleep.
Please, Fred.
Rockabye doggy on the treetop When the wind blows  All right, so I'm not Dinah Shore.
You're no Lassie, either.
Now, Fred, please, get in there and go to sleep.
Don't you know what time it is?

It's 3:00 in the morning.
Do you hear me?

Now, look, look, now, nice clock, nice clock.

Look at that.
Look at that.
Yeah.
Yeah, see?
That's a nice boy.
That's a nice Fred.
Yeah.
Hey, he stopped.
How'd you do it?
Well, I remember reading someplace if you put a clock in with a little puppy, they go to sleep.
The ticking sound keeps them company or something, I don't know.
Oh, nice work.
We can only hope.
Good night.
Good night.
What are you doing?
You put an alarm clock in there!
I didn't know it was gonna go off.
What's the matter with you?
We're coming!
We're coming!
Who's that?
Who's that?
How do I know?
Wait a minute!
What are you That dog's got to go and right this minute!
All right now, take it easy, Fred, take it easy.
What do you mean, take it easy?
Mr. Stewart, the new tenant, just phoned and threatens to move!
All right.
Lucy, I'm sorry, but it's either the tenants or the dog.
And dogs don't pay rent.
All right, Fred, all right.
We'll get rid of him tomorrow morning.
Well, see that you do.
Okay.
Come on, Fred.
You're awful cranky.
Yeah, go back to bed, will you, Fred?
Now, look, honey, I'm sorry, but you will have to tell Little Ricky that he has to get rid of the dog.
I'll make a deal with you: You tell Little Ricky, I'll tell the dog.
Look, honey, let's be sensible.
Tomorrow morning, when Little Ricky gets up, one of us will tell him.
Which one?
Well whoever sees him first.
Okay.
Good morning, Fred.
All right, Ricky Ricardo, will you please tell me where you were going?
Me?
Uh, rehearsal.
Yeah, that's it, rehearsal at the club.
At 7:00 in the morning?
Well, yeah, well Uh, never mind about me.
Where were you going?
To the market.
The market is open at 7:00 in the morning?
If you can have a rehearsal, the market can be open!
I know what you were trying to do.
You were trying to sneak out of the apartment so you didn't have to tell Little Ricky.
Yeah, well, you gotta get up awful early in the morning to sneak out of this apartment.
You can say that again.
Yeah you're right, honey.
I'm his father.
I guess I should tell him.
Oh, well, honey, I'm glad you finally decided.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Daddy.
Well, good morning, sweetheart.
Hi, son.
Say, uh, I want to talk to you, partner because you He went to get his dog.

Hee-hee.
Who is it?
It's me, Fred.
Well, what is it, Fred?
Well, Mr. Stewart here claims that he heard a dog barking.
You did get rid of that dog, didn't you, Lucy?
Well, you told me to, didn't you, Fred?
Well, that's what I told Mr. Stewart, but he insists on having a look for himself.
Oh.
Oh, well, just a minute, Fred.
Honey, it's way past your nap time.
You run in and take your nap, sweetheart.
Okay, Mommy.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Go on.
What's keeping you, Lucy?
Okay.
Okay, Fred, just a minute.
Oh, hello, Fred.
Oh, oh, hello.
This is Mr. Stewart, your new neighbor.
This is Mrs. Ricardo.
How do you do, sir?
Do you have a dog in here?
A dog in here?
I told you they got rid of it.
Then what was that barking a few minutes ago?
Oh, you must have been hearing things sir.
Now, just remember, Mertz.
If I find there is a dog in this building, I'm taking back the first and last month's rent and moving out.
I can assure you, there's no dog around here.
Right, Lucy?
Oh, you won't find a dog around here.
Oh, no?
Well, if there's no dog in this apartment, what are these doing here?
Oh, they're mine.
I love a snack in the afternoon.
You eat dog biscuits?
Oh, yes.
Yes, yes.
Th-they're wonderful.
I just love them.
Um, um, um, I Would you Oh, you should try it!
There's, um They're They got it all over doughnuts for dunking.
Want one?
Fred?
No, no, thanks.
I'm trying to cut down.
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi, Rick.
Oh, hi!
This is Mr. Stewart, your new neighbor.
This is Mr. Ricardo.
Oh.
How do you do?
I'm sorry about all that noise last night.
It won't happen again.
I should hope not.
Oh, we, we got rid of the dog this morning, didn't we, Lucy?
Well, you don't see him around, do you?
Well, good.
Uh, excuse me.
Uh, oh, I'll, I'll hang that up for you, dear.
I can do it, honey.
No, no, no, I'll do it.
That's what wives are for.
Oh, so that's what they're for.
Say, uh, Mr. Stewart, what kind of business are you in?
I'm retired.
Oh, well, nice work if you can get it.
Mr. Ricardo's in the nightclub business.
He owns the Club Babalu.
You've probably heard of it.
I never go to nightclubs.
Oh, oh.
Mr. Stewart wants to remodel his kitchen, Ricky.
Do you mind if he has a look at yours?
Well, we have a very modest Yeah, go ahead, honey, show him the kitchen.
Go ahead, dear.
The kitchen's right in here, Mr. Stewart.
Oh, thanks.
Right in here?
What's that doing on the floor?
Oh, I, uh I- I was gonna practice my hat dancing.
What hat dancing?
Oh, I was gonna try to surprise you, dear.
I've been taking hat dancing lessons from Arthur Murray.
Yeah?
Yeah!
Ole!
The kitchen's right in here.
Hey!
Hey!
Well, I guess I'd better get back to my own apartment.
Well, I told you it wasn't much of a kitchen, you know.
I must remind you, you'll have to stand the expense.
I know, I know.
You told me 20 times.
Just so you understand.
I understand.
I have a very nice carpenter.
What was that?
It's me, I'm playing the piano.
Since when do you play the piano?
I thought I'd play the piano, uh, so that I can accompany myself with my hat dancing.
Well, that was very strange-sounding music.
Well, it's, uh, progressive jazz.
I'm taking singing lessons!
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, where's my dog?
!
For goodness sake, come here.
Here's your dog, son.
That does it, Mertz.
I'm moving.
I must remind you, Stewart, you have a lease.
The lease says, "No pets.
" Now, either the dog goes, or I go.
Good.
I'd rather live with a little dog than a big grouch!
Here, take your check back and scram!
With pleasure!
Adios!
Oh, hello, Mr. Stewart I guess I told him off.
Hey, what's the matter with Mr. Stewart?
Oh, Fred just did a wonderful thing.
He sure did, he told Mr. Stewart he could take his check back and told him to scram.
Yeah.
Darn right I did.
It's not the money, it's the principle of the thing.
Fred, you gave him back the whole $250?
Yes, I gave him back the whole 200 : $250?
!
Get the fan, honey, and fan him.
Oh, Fred Do something, fan him.
Fred?

{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
"Lucy and Superman"     TV  To you children in the New York area, Superman will be making personal appearances this week at Macy's Department Store.
Check your local paper for all details.
Okay, Superman, Jr., time to go to bed.
Oh, no, Mommy.
Come on, now, honey, Superman's going to bed.
He always goes to bed right after his show.
Yeah, come on, partner, I'll tuck you in.
Oh, wait a minute now.
Superman always takes his cape off before he goes to bed.
There we are.
Okay, sweetheart.
'Night, Mommy.
Good night, angel.
Don't forget to say your prayers.
Mommy?
What, dear?
Can Superman come to my birthday party Saturday?
Superman come to your birthday party?
Well, I don't know about that, honey.
But I'll tell you what.
If you're a good boy, I'll take you down to Macy's to see him.
Oh, boy!
Come on, Ricky.
Whoop-de-do.
What's all that?
These are the favors we bought for Little Ricky's birthday party.
Oh, they're just perfect.
How much do I owe you?
Oh, they're our treat.
$5.32.
Fred.
Oh, now, you shouldn't pay for all these things.
You see, Ethel, those were my exact words.
Oh, Fred.
You'll have to excuse him.
We still haven't rented that apartment next door to you, and that's why he's acting so stingy.
I mean, stingier than usual.
Ha-ha.
Oh, now, Fred!
Hi.
Hi, Ricky.
Are those the favors for Little Ricky's party?
Yeah.
Aren't they cute?
Yeah.
Since we're Little Ricky's godparents, we're buying all the favors.
Well, that's very generous of you.
You're telling me.
Oh, Fred.
Of course, we also want to get him a gift.
A gift, too?
Yes, a gift, too.
What do you think he'd like, Lucy?
Oh, I don't know.
If I don't rent that apartment next door, I'll be glad to give him the whole building.
Fred, will you stop grousing?
Look, you've already done enough now.
Forget about a gift.
Hey, Ethel, lay off those nuts.
They're for company.
Well, thanks a lot.
I just meant that you're not company, dear; you're more like family.
Oh.
Gee, I should have known they weren't for us; they're fresh.
Oh, come on.
Who's coming over?
Caroline and Charlie Appleby.
Yeah.
They were in the neighborhood and called us.
And we couldn't think of an excuse fast enough, so they're dropping by.
An excuse?
I thought Caroline was a good friend of yours.
Oh, she is, but she's so boring.
She's one of those mothers who's always bragging about her child.
Yeah, and Charlie's even worse.
Her Stevie is so cute, Her Stevie is so sweet.
Her Stevie is so smart.
Ooh, I get so sick of it Yeah.
when everyone knows that Little Ricky is a lot cuter, a lot sweeter and certainly a lot smarter.
Yeah.
But for bores, they're really awfully nice people, so I guess we can put up with them, huh?
Besides, Stevie's Little Ricky's best friend.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, I must remember to invite Stevie to the party Saturday.
Sure, you gotta invite him to the party, honey.
What are you looking for, dear?
I'm looking for the new pictures I took of Little Ricky.
Oh.
Here they are.
What do you want with them?
Well, when Charlie Appleby starts to bore me with his pictures of Little Stevie, I'm gonna be ready.
Come on, Fred, let's get out of here.
I don't want to stick around for the "bore war.
" Oh, come on.
Thanks for the gifts.
Oh, that's all right, honey.
See you later, Rick.
Bye, Fred.
Oh, I just love buying them.
Don't mention it.
Okay.
Bye.
Good night.
What's the matter with you, boy?
I'm practicing.
For once, I'm gonna beat Charlie Appleby to the draw.
Oh And he picked up Marilyn Monroe, slung her over his shoulder and carried her off.
Oh, Caroline, that just sounds like a wonderful movie.
We have to see that, honey.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was good all right.
Say, do you realize we've been here almost an hour and not one of us has even mentioned our children?
You know you're absolutely right, Charlie.
Seems like whenever people with children get together, that's all they can talk about.
Personally, I think it's a terrible bore.
Yeah, yeah, me, too.
'Course, every once in a while, Stevie does something so cute, I just can't resist telling about it.
Like the other day, we, we were talking about his birthday- he'll be five next week, you know- he came up to me and he said he came up to me and he said he said, "Daddy, are you five years old yet"?
"Are you five years old yet"?
Yeah.
"Are you five years old yet"?
That's very cute.
Yeah, cute.
Oh, say, speaking of birthdays, we want to invite Little Ricky to Stevie's party.
Well, thank you very much.
We want to invite Stevie to Ricky's party, too.
Oh, well, good.
He'd love to come.
I just remembered- the kids were born four days apart.
That's right.
Well, then we'll expect Little Ricky at 2:00 Saturday afternoon.
That's fine.
Saturday afternoon?
That's when we're having Little Ricky's party.
Oh, my goodness, what a shame.
Oh, this is awful.
Well, honey, neither of the kids' birthdays is really on Saturday, so one of us will change the day of the party.
Sure, and that way, all their little friends can go to both parties.
Yeah.
Well, that's a good idea.
One of us will change.
Yeah.
One of us will have to change.
What day are you gonna have your party on, Caroline?
Now, wait a minute, Lucy.
I don't want Stevie's party another day.
Saturday's the best day; it's a non-school day.
But it makes much more sense for you to change, Caroline.
After all, Stevie's birthday isn't on Saturday.
It's on Thursday, isn't it?
Well, so what?
Little Ricky's birthday isn't till next Monday.
Well, Monday's much closer to Saturday than Thursday.
How do you figure?
Well, Monday's all part of the weekend- you know, Saturday, Sunday, Monday- but Thursday- it's Thursday Friday Saturday.
Thursday is miles from Saturday.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Thursday is just as close to Saturday as Monday.
Well What time was Little Stevie born?
Aha!
Little Ricky was born at 11:00 in the morning.
And 11:00 Monday is closer to 2:00 Saturday than 12:00 Thursday.
So, you'll just have to change your party, Caroline.
Oh, now, wait, wait, Stevie was born in California.
That's Pacific standard time.
So, that means he actually would've been born three hours later in New York time Well, if you're gonna drag in those phony technicalities.
Well, you're the one who started it.
Well, we'll just see who'll change their party, Caroline.
Yeah, we'll just see.
Yes, we will.
All right, all right, now, girls, it's no use getting upset about nothing.
Don't worry, you'll work something out.
Anyone care for a cigarette?
Caroline?
No, thank you.
Lucy?
No.
Thank you.
Ricky?
Yes.
Let's have a cigarette.
Oh, I just remembered.
I've got some new pictures here of Stevie.
Isn't that cute?
Isn't that the cutest thing?
about Pacific standard time.
Ricky, what do you want for breakfast, dear?
Nothing, honey, I'm awful late.
Okay.
If there's one thing I can't stand is someone who's pigheaded.
Now, it wouldn't have hurt her a bit to change her party to another day.
Well, it wouldn't hurt you to change yours either.
Whose side are you on?
!
Well, I'm in Little Ricky's camp.
Well, all right.
But why can't you both have your parties on Saturday?
Because Stevie and Ricky are in the same class at school, and they'll each be inviting the same children.
Well, can't you split the guest list down the middle?
No, that won't work.
She's invited a clown, a magician.
She's having a puppet show.
All the little kids will want to go to Stevie's party.
Oh.
Well, why don't you get some entertainment that'll top Caroline's, and then they'll want to come to Little Ricky's party.
Who am I gonna get?
Oh, boy, there goes Superman!
Ethel, that's it!
That's what?
I'll get Superman for Ricky's party.
How could you do that?
Ricky'll get him for me.
He met him when we were in Hollywood.
And Superman's in town; I heard it on television.
Oh, boy, that'd be great.
Wouldn't it?
Honey, will you do me a favor?
Will you call Superman this afternoon?
Sure, dear.
Good-bye.
Superman?
!
Yeah, for Ricky's party Saturday.
Oh, oh.
Oh, yeah, hey, that would be a wonderful idea.
Will you get him for me?
Okay, honey, I'll call him the minute I get to the club.
Okay, dear.
All right.
Boy, imagine having a father who knows Superman.
Oh!
How about that?
Ha, ha, ha!
Hey, Ricky, guess what?
You're gonna get your wish.
Who do you think's coming to your party Saturday?
Superman!
Oh, boy, oh, boy!
Ha, ha!
Hello.
Hello, Caroline.
Oh, hello, Lucy.
How are you, dear?
Fine, dear, and how are you?
Fine.
I'm calling about Little Ricky's party Saturday.
Oh.
Look, Lucy, if you're determined to have Little Ricky's party on Saturday, I'm afraid he's going to be awfully lonesome.
All the children seem so anxious to see the magician and the puppets and the clowns.
Yes, uh, Little Ricky was, too, until he found out that Superman's going to be at his party.
Superman's coming to Little Ricky's party?
Uh-huh.
Superman?
Oh, boy!
Shh!
I want to go to Little Ricky's party.
Now, listen, Stevie, you're having a party of your own.
I don't want a party.
I want to go to Little Ricky's party.
Now, now, Stevie.
I want to see Superman, I want to see Superman.
Oh, Stevie, shh Is that Little Stevie I hear?
He sounds so cute.
O- kay, Lucy, you win.
We'll change our party.
Well, if you insist, dear.
See you Saturday, then.
Toodle-oo.
Lucy!
What?
Will you hide my sterling silver for me?
Sure, but why?
Oh, it's Fred.
He's frantic because that apartment next door is still empty.
What's that got to do with this?
He's getting that look in his eye that means he's gonna pawn the family silver.
Oh, Ethel, he wouldn't do that.
Not your mother's flatware.
He'd pawn me if I had a few more gold fillings.
Ethel, call the police!
Somebody stole our silver.
Oh, there it is.
What did you want with it, Fred?
Well, I-I noticed last thanksgiving that it was getting a little tarnished, and I want to clean it.
Oh, sure.
Well, then give it to me so I can clean it.
Oh, no, nothing doing.
Oh Well, then what did you do with my mandolin?
It's downstairs in a box in the basement.
But you won't get more than 50 cents on that.
Well, 50 cents is two hamburgers, and that'll keep us eating for another day.
Isn't that a pitiful sight?
Poor Fred.
Oh, here, girl.
What's this?
That's your invitation to the party.
I thought it was sort of silly to mail it with the others.
Oh, honey, you didn't have to invite us.
I insist that you come.
I need your help.
Our help?
Ethel, we're having ten five-year-olds.
When they start wrestling and fighting, I want you and Fred to help referee.
Oh, but don't forget you'll have Superman here to keep them in line.
Well, that might help a little.
Yeah.
Gee, honey, that's a cute invitation.
Aren't they sweet?
Hello?
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi, we all set with Superman?
Well, I'm afraid not, dear.
You see, I talked to his secretary, and he's leaving Saturday for Terry Hoot.
For Terry who?
Terry Hoot.
Terry hoot, Indiana.
He's taking a plane Saturday.
Oh, no.
What's the matter, honey?
Superman pooped out.
Oh, honey, can't he take a later plane?
That's the only flight that day.
Oh, if he's Superman, what does he need a plane for?
All right, all right.
Oh, I've already told Little Ricky and all the other children.
Well, honey, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't cross your bridges before they're hatched.
What?
You shouldn't burn your chickens behind you.
Oh, you know what I mean.
You shouldn't tell people anything until you're sure.
Oh.
Well, I was so certain you'd get him.
I tried, honey, but I can't, so don't worry about it.
Little Ricky will have a very nice party anyway.
Oh, I hope so.
All right, dear, good-bye.
Good-bye, dear.
Oh, dear.
Gee, that's a shame, Lucy.
What are you going to do now?
I don't know.
If I can't produce Superman, my name will be Supermud.
Well, knowing you, I'm surprised you don't dress up like Superman and play the part yourself.
Oh, Ethel, I could never get away with a silly thing like that.
I'll say you couldn't.
Although maybe I could find some ballet tights and make some sort of a cape, and then run around the room like crazy and they wouldn't know the difference.
Are you serious?
I don't want to disappoint those kids.
Now, look, here's what we'll do.
Sometime during the party, you rush over to the window, look up into the sky and announce my arrival.
You mean like this?
Kids, guess who's here?
It's Sup The window?
Oh, now, you're not gonna fly in here?
!
Well, not exactly.
Uh, during the party, I'll slip away and I'll go to the vacant apartment next door.
I'll go out the window and walk along the ledge.
The ledge?
Honey, that's three stories high!
You might break your neck.
Well, I'd rather break my neck than break my promise to Little Ricky.
Oh, gee, Lucy, I don't know.
Isn't there some other way Superman comes into a room?
Well, sometimes he comes bursting through a wall, but you know how Fred would feel about that.
Yep, you'd better fly in.
Yeah.
It's Terry's turn.
Having fun?
Oh, they're having a great time, honey.
Say, Lucy, Stevie's been asking me when Superman's coming.
When is he coming, dear?
Oh, I have a feeling he'll be along any minute.
Okay, here we go.
There you go.
There you go.
He came pretty close.
Lucy, I still say the helmet's wrong.
Superman doesn't wear a helmet.
He would if he wanted to cover his long, red hair.
I'm just afraid you won't be able to fool the kids, that's all.
Well, let's hope they're so logy with ice cream and cake, they won't know the difference.
Yeah, let's hope so.
Now, look, wait ten minutes, and then give signal.
Yeah, I will.
You didn't tell Fred, did you?
Oh, of course not.
Good.
Hey, what'll I tell Ricky if he comes home before you come in?
Oh, just tell him anything.
Anything?
Anything but the truth.
Oh.
Good luck.
All right.
Now, Lucy, be careful.
I will.
London bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down London bridge is falling down, my fair lady.
Ha, ha, ha!
Let's lock him up, lock him up, lock him up Yes?
How do you do?
Oh, look, Martha, a party!
Oh, is the landlord here?
We saw the note on his door.
We'd like to look at the apartment.
that's for rent.
Oh, well, he's busy just now.
You'll have to come back tomorrow.
Those folks want to see the apartment?
Yes, but I'll show it to them.
You're having so much fun.
Right over here.
Right over here.
London bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down Shoosh, shoosh.
Shoosh!
Shoosh!
Go deliver your messages.
Uh, just a minute.
Uh, here it is.
Oh, nice.
Well, now, uh, now then you just, uh, look around and I'll be right next door.
Well, we'd like to ask you a few questions.
Oh, you would?
Yes.
Would you redecorate if we signed a lease?
Well, uh, yes, I think we-we could do that.
Uh-huh, yes.
Oh, all right, why don't you go to Central Park?
There's a million statues over there.
Oh, come on, fellas.
Everybody off.
Ah, you big sissy.
Oh, why don't you get off and walk?
I wish I knew some pigeon English.
My turn!
My turn!
Catch him.
My turn!
My turn!
Go get him!
Hurry up.
Hi, kids!
Hi, Rick.
Having a good time?
Want to get into that game?
Yeah, listen, where's Lucy?
Isn't she in the kitchen?
No, but guess who is.
Who?
Superman!
Superman!
Well, you know, when he heard that it was a birthday party, he didn't want to disappoint the kids.
Isn't that great?
Yeah.
You don't Where, where'd she go?
Ethel said she went out for some more ice cream, and she hasn't come back yet.
Oh, dear.
I wanted her to be here, for the surprise, but I can't keep him too long.
I know it.
Well, we'll have to do it.
All right, children, I got a wonderful surprise for you.
Now if you all line up there and close your eyes.
You're gonna get your wish, young man.
Just close your eyes.
Right there, honey.
Close your eyes.
Don't look now.
Now when I tell you to look, you look.
You're gonna see your favorite television star.
Look- Superman!
How about that?
And happy birthday, Little Ricky.
Which one of you is Ricky?
That's me.
That's him right there.
How are you, sweetie?
Happy birthday.
How about that, huh?
Any of you fellows want to wrestle?
Yeah!
Yeah!
We're not needed here.
Come on, scoot, go home, go home, go home.
Heard any good stories lately?
I'm sorry, but I really have to get back to the party.
Oh, we just love the apartment.
But I'm not sure my wife ought to be up so high.
Yes, you see, I get dizzy spells.
Oh.
Well, you make up your mind, and then you let me know.
Shoosh, scoot, scat, scoot, scat.
There's good light.
There's plenty of closet space here.
Martha, what is it?
Out there.
I just saw something strange.
Something strange?
Three flights up?
Was it a bird?
No.
Was it a plane?
No.
Well, what was it, dear?
It was Superman!
There, there, Martha.
Oh, come, come, come, Martha.
Oh We'll look for some basement apartments.
These heights make you dizzier than I thought.
Oh, it's raining in.
I'll close the window for Mrs. Mertz.
Ooh!
There.
Now, come on, we'll go home so you can lie down, honey.
That's it.
Shoosh.
Oh!
Bye-bye, Superman.
Bye, kids Bye.
Bye.
We're glad you had a good time.
Good-bye, Stevie.
Bye, now.
Glad you had a good time.
Well, Superman, that was a wonderful thing you did.
Oh, Ricky, it was my pleasure.
I'm only sorry I didn't get to meet Lucy.
I've heard so much about her.
Yeah, well, I don't know.
Where is Lucy, Ethel?
Oh, she'll be here in a minute.
She's out on the ledge.
Oh.
Out on the ledge?
!
Out here?
Yes What's she doing out there?
Lucy!
Oh, my goodness.
Lucy, are you all right?
I'm caught!
Wait don't move, honey!
I'll come and get you right away.
Wait a minute.
Oh No, Daddy, let Superman do it.
All right.
Come on.
Allow me?
Yes, please.
Oh, boy!
Ah!
How do you do?
My name is Superman.
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you.
Tell me, when you're flying around, do you have cape trouble?
No, but then I've had a lot more flying time than you have.
Oh.
Lucy, what are you doing out there?
!
Oh, I'm fixing the drainpipe.
It was a little loose.
Are you crazy?
What are you doing in that outfit?
Well, uh There you are.
Come in here!
I want an explanation.
Okay.
Come on in here right now!
Can you teach me to fly?
Uh Lucy, of all the crazy things that you've done in the 15 years that we've been married Ricardo, do you mean to say that you've been married to her for Yeah, 15 years.
And they call me Superman.

{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Ethel!
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Did you have a nice weekend in Connecticut?
Oh, honey, it was just marvelous.
The Munsons' place is so beautiful and Grace Munson is so sweet.
Look what she gave me to bring home.
Country butter.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Grace made that herself, and look Grape jelly.
From the grapes in their own arbors.
Grace made that, too.
And look at the size of these eggs.
Now, don't tell me that Grace Oh Ha!
Don't be silly.
But they're from their own chickens.
Oh.
And these are for you.
Oh, thanks, honey.
Oh, Ethel, there's nothing like living in the country.
Clean, fresh air, homegrown food.
Lucy, you're not thinking of moving, are you?
Why not?
It'd be great for Little Ricky.
And Grace took us to see the most wonderful house that's for sale- a quaint, old, early American.
Why, Lucy, you're really serious about this.
Well, I am, but Ricky isn't.
We argued about it all the way home on the train.
You know how pigheaded he can be.
Well, hurray for pigheaded Ricky.
Ethel, whose side are you on?
Well, I know it'd be wonderful for Little Ricky, but I'm thinking of big Ethel.
Gee, if you moved to the country, I may never see you again.
Oh, now, it's not as bad as all that.
You and Fred can come out on the train on weekends.
A round-trip ticket's only $3.08.
Now I know I'll never see you again.
Oh Hi, Ethel.
Hi, Rick.
Hi, dear.
Honey, I'm in a hurry.
I haven't got time for breakfast.
Oh, honey, I wanted to fix you a couple those nice, fresh country eggs.
I'm sorry, honey, but I got to go.
Oh, and I wanted to give you some toast spread with country butter and homemade jelly.
Lucy, don't start that again.
Start what again?
We decided on the train last night that we're not gonna talk about moving to the country anymore.
We didn't, you did.
I decided to keep right on talking about it.
All right, you keep on talking and I'll keep right on not listening.
Oh, honey, won't you at least think about it before you say no?
All right.
No.
Oh, you.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Bye, Ethel.
: Bye, Rick.
Oh, boy, good for him.
I have a feeling this is one time you're not going to be able to talk Ricky into something.
Don't you be too sure.
All my life I've wanted to live in a quaint, old, early American house, and I'm not giving up without a fight.
Oh, speaking of quaint old early Americans, I have to fix Fred's breakfast.
See you later.
Okay.
Thanks for the eggs, honey.
Okay.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Moving the furniture.
Well, obviously, but why is it all pushed together in the middle of the room?
So I can show Ricky how cramped it is living in a crowded city apartment.
And then he'll want to move to the country, is that it?
Ethel, I wish you'd stop thinking like my friend and start thinking like Little Ricky's godmother.
Well, I just don't want you to move away, that's all.
Oh Gee.
Look out.
Morbid curiosity makes me ask: What is that for?
That's to show Ricky how really dirty it is in the city.
I should have known.
Yeah.
Don't tell me.
City pallor.
That's right.
Oh.
Let's see now.
There, I'm all ready for Ricky to come home.
When is the poor unsuspecting victim due?
Any minute now.
Well, bad luck.
Oh, Ethel, honestly.
Hi, honey.
: Oh, hi, dear.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Why?
You look kind of pale.
Oh, that.
Well, we don't get much sun around here, you know?
It was sunny today when you were out.
Yeah, I was out, but you know how it is here in New York, with all the big skyscrapers.
The Empire State Building has better color than I do.
Lucy, what are you driving at?
Nothing, darling.
Here, I'll hang this up for you.
Oh, honestly!
This apartment gets smaller every day.
What's the matter with the furniture?
Not a thing.
Why?
Why is it all scrunched up together in the middle like that?
Well, that's what happens after you spend a weekend in the country.
You realize how small these city apartments really are.
Any mail today?
It's on the mantle, dear.
Thank you.
Oh, honestly, the dirt in this city!
Now, you wouldn't believe that I dusted there just a half an hour ago, would you?
Oh, living in this congested city, you just have one cold after another.
Lucy, I think you have gone far enough.
: How's that?
I said you have gone far enough.
Oh, you're gonna have to speak up, dear.
I can't hear a thing over that city noise.
Why don't you sit down, dear, if you can find room in this crowded apartment.
I'm gonna put our poor little city child to bed in his stuffy, dusty little room.
While you're in there, wash that pale look off your face.
Hi, Rick.
Hi.
Hi.
Go ahead.
Uh, Rick, we've been talking it over and we think you should move to the country.
You do?
Yup.
After all, it doesn't matter if we have a vacant apartment, and what's money compared to the health and well-being of our good friends?
Fred, you really mean that?
No, but Ethel made me say it.
He does, too, mean it.
I really do, Rick.
For once you should listen to the rattle-brained redhead.
I get it.
You're part of Lucy's propaganda campaign.
No, we're not.
I was against it at first and said so, but after I got to thinking it over, I realized I was just being selfish.
Little Ricky should live in the country.
You really think so, huh?
Yes, I think that every child is better off when they're out in the fresh air.
Can you keep a secret?
Ethel, put your fingers in your ears.
Why?
Because the only way you can keep a secret is not to hear it.
Oh, never mind now.
I won't tell, Ricky.
Well, you know, next week is our 16th wedding anniversary.
Yeah, I know that.
And I got a surprise for Lucy.
Oh, what is it?
I bought her that house in the country.
You bought the house?
Yeah.
Isn't that wonderful?
You know, I pretended to be against it at first to throw her off the track.
But it's a wonderful house and I got a real bargain.
I gave the man $500 deposit this afternoon.
Gee, that's swell.
What's the matter, Ethel?
I thought you said we should move.
Yes, I I know we said you should move, but But what?
You're going to move.
Good grief, Ethel.
Oh, now, it won't be that bad.
Sure, we can go out and see them on weekends.
Fred, round-trip tickets on the train cost $3.08 apiece.
Like I said, they can come in and see us on weekends.
Good night, sweetheart.
Shh Well, hi, Fred.
Hi.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi.
Honey, the baby wants you to come in and tell him a bedtime story.
All right, dear.
Why don't you tell him the one about Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer who lived in the big city and had one cold after another and had to keep blowing his nose and that's why his nose was red.
I'll do that.
Or you could tell him the one about Snow White and the seven city dwarfs- Sneezy, Dusty, Stuffy, Drafty, Sniffly, Noisy That's enough.
..
and Pasty.
Gee, I'm sure not getting anywhere with him.
You don't suppose through the years, Ricky has grown an immunity to me, do you?
Well, they're giving shots for everything these days.
Well, I don't know.
Looks like the Ricardos and the Mertzes are gonna be living side by side for the rest of their lives.
What's the matter with you, Ethel?
Are you crying?
No.
No, I I just guess I'm getting one of those city colds you were talking about.
You are, too, crying.
: I am not!
Oh, Ethel.
Come on, Ethel, we'd better get out of here.
No, now, wait a minute, Fred.
Something's wrong.
What is it, Ethel?
Oh, Lucy, I know you're not gonna move, but if you ever do move, don't move!
: Oh, Lucy Why, I've never seen her like this before.
Oh, she's out of control.
Oh, well Come on, honey, but you'd better go home and lie down and take a nap and I'll put a cold cloth on your head.
No, no, no.
Oh, honey, now, there's no need to get upset, We're not moving to the country.
You heard what Ricky said.
: Oh Well, honey, I know how you feel.
I'd hate to leave you, too.
I must have been crazy to even think about moving.
Yes, Lucy.
Oh, for corn's sake.
I wouldn't leave you two and go to the country if you paid me.
You wouldn't?
Really, I wouldn't.
Oh Well, he fell asleep right after I was  What happened?
Oh, honey, thank you for being so stubborn and pigheaded.
What?
I'm glad you didn't buy that house.
I don't want to move.
You dun't?
No, I "dun't.
" I want to stay right here in the city near my loved ones.
Well, one of your loved ones isn't gonna be very near.
Which one?
Me- I'm gonna be living in the country.
What?
Well, I wanted to save it as a surprise for our anniversary, but Well, I bought you that house.
Yes.
You bought me that house?
Oh, Ricky, that's the sweetest, nicest thing you've ever done in all the years we've been married.
I thought so.
Oh, wasn't that sweet?
Sweet, sweet.
Oh What's the matter with them?
Five minutes ago, she wanted the house.
Oh, that was before Ethel turned on the waterworks.
Well, if I'd known that the Bobbsey twins were gonna pledge eternal friendship, I wouldn't have given that guy $500 deposit this afternoon.
Well, honey, you can get your deposit back.
How?
Well, can't you just tell him that you changed your mind?
Yes.
Well, honey, buying a house is not like buying a dress.
You just can't call up the guy and say "I don't like the color.
" Well, you could tell him it doesn't fit.
Yes.
All right, all right, I'll call him first thing in the morning and see what I can do.
Oh, thank you, honey.
Oh, Ricky!
Are you sure you won't change your mind again?
I'm positive, honey.
I never want to live any other place as long as I live.
All right.
I just want to be right here.
Okay.
Okay.
Women- you can't live with them, but I guess it'd be pretty hard to live without them.
Well, it might be worth a try.
Well, I know, I know, Mr. Spaulding, but you see, well, my wife changed her mind and I thought that maybe we could Sure.
Yes, sir, uh-huh.
All right, sir.
Good-bye.
What did he say?
Is he gonna give you your deposit back?
He said absolutely not.
A deal is a deal.
Oh, dear.
You mean you have to move to the country whether you want to or not?
No.
But if I don't buy the house, I lose $500.
Well, I don't think that's very nice of Mr. Spaulding not giving you your money back.
Well, honey, on the strength of us buying his house, he bought another house down the road, so you can't blame him for holding us to the deal.
I sure wouldn't be as calm as you are if I were losing $500.
If you were losing $500, you'd be foaming at the mouth.
Well, I guess that's that.
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
It's all my fault.
Maybe maybe you could take it out of my allowance for the next 50 years.
I have to go to the club, honey.
I'll talk to you when I come home.
Good-bye.
Bye, Rick.
Bye.
So long, Rick.
Oh, gee.
There must be some way to get that $500 back.
Fred, you know about real estate and things.
Isn't there some way that we can make Mr. Spaulding give, um, give that deposit back?
Well, I don't know.
Unless you could fix it some way to make him think you're undesirable, and he didn't want you to have the house.
Hey, that's a good idea.
Yeah.
Now, let's think.
How can we do that?
We?
How did we get in on this?
Well, for heaven's sake, Ethel, You and Fred are the reason that I don't want to move.
The least you can do is help me out of this fix.
Oh, you're right.
Let's see now.
How can we be undesirable?
That shouldn't be hard for you, Ethel.
Never mind now.
Just think.
Oh, there, there, Eleanor.
I can't help it, Gerald.
Moving out of this house after 30 years.
Well, we're not moving to the North Pole, my dear.
We'll be living right down the road.
Oh, it won't be the same.
Oh, maybe you should give the Ricardos their money back.
Now, Eleanor, a deal is a deal.
And don't forget, we both agreed now that the children are married, we don't need this big house.
That's right.
Oh, I do hope they're nice people and will take care of it.
They seem like very nice people.
Well, you never can tell, dear.
Remember, they're in show business.
Oh, now, Eleanor, we mustn't be narrow-minded.
Some of them are all right.
I suppose so.
Oh, I'll, uh, I'll see who that is.
Hiya, Pops.
Uh oh, Mrs. Ricardo.
That's right.
Do you mind if I bring a couple my friends in and case the joint?
Uh, well, uh, not at all.
I just want to show them around, you know.
Come on in, the coast is clear.
I want you to meet a couple friends of mine, Fred and Ethel Mertz.
Uh, how do you do?
Hiya, honey.
Lay off, baby.
Okay.
Oh, Eleanor.
Oh, hiya, toots.
You, uh, you know Mrs. Ricardo, and these are her friends, Fred and Ethel Mertz.
How do you do?
Hi, honey.
Lay off, baby.
Mrs. Ricardo, you you don't look at all the way you did the other day.
Your clothes are so different.
Oh, you mean that little dark suit and the hat with the veil and the little white gloves?
Yes, that's right.
I was on my way to a masquerade party.
Went as a lady.
Well, come on, let's case the joint.
Okay.
Whoo, boy.
Well, nice little hideout.
Hideout?
He means hideaway.
Hey, Fingers, get a load of this.
Perfect spot for stashing the ice.
Yeah.
Ice?
Oh, we have a refrigerator.
Ah, you're cute, kiddo.
Corny, but cute.
Leave it to The Brains to pick out a spot like this.
Yeah, they don't call him "The Brains" for nothing.
Brains?
Tricky Ricky Ricardo.
Your husband?
I thought he was a bandleader.
He's our leader.
We're the band.
But he told us he had a rhumba band.
Oh, that one again.
Don't tell me he used that phony Spanish accent, too?
Whoops!
Sorry.
Fingers, I thought I told you not to pack a rod unless we were pulling a job.
Now hand it over.
Why should I?
You ain't The Brains.
No, but I'm Mrs. Brains and don't you forget it, bub.
Uh, Mrs. Ricardo What do you want?
Well, uh, Eleanor and I have just been thinking, and perhaps this isn't the right house for you after all.
Now just a minute.
A deal's a deal.
The Brains bought this house and gave you his check for a deposit.
Well, it's not really a deal unless I cash the check.
Is that so?
So what I think I'll do is just return it, nothing personal.
That's right, nothing personal.
Now The Brains will have to find another house.
He ain't gonna like this.
What do I care what he likes?
Watch out or you'll step on The Brains' toes, Fingers.
All right, hands up, everybody!
Not you, Eleanor.
Don't try anything funny.
Eleanor, get her purse, that's where she put the gun.
Careful.
Uh, Mr. Spaulding, I can explain everything.
You can explain it to the police.
Well, I'd rather explain it to you, sir.
No, to the police.
And here, you can take your check back.
We don't want your kind of people out here.
Take it, take it.
All right, now back up against the fireplace.
You, too, buster.
Back up.
All right, now turn around.
That's better.
Oh, Eleanor, see who that is at the door, and be careful.
Higher with the hands!
It's The Brains!
Mr. Spaulding, what's All right, get your hands up!
What's the matter?
Back over here, Brains.
What?
Right there.
Back up.
Somebody wanna tell me what's go What are you doing here?
Well, I got your deposit back, dear, here.
Oh, good.
What are we doing up with our hands like this?
Well, uh, he thinks we're gangsters.
Gangsters!
That's right, Ricardo.
And you can drop that phony Spanish accent.
Huh?
We-we-we pretended to be gangsters so that Mr. Spaulding would think we were undesirable and then wouldn't sell us his house, see, so we can get your deposit back, and it worked.
Except that we might have to spend the rest of our lives in the pokey.
If my hands weren't up here, they'd be right around your neck.
Look, Mr. Spaulding, this is very simple.
My wife just changed her mind She really didn't make Back!
Back!
Back!
Back!
Back!
Back!
I changed my mind, that's all.
Mr. Spaulding, I know that it's very difficult for anybody to believe that anyone would pull a stunt like this, but you don't know my dizzy wife and her crackpot friends.
Quiet!
Quiet!
Quiet!
Quiet.
The man said quiet.
I'd never known such gabby gangsters.
Mr. Spaulding, I-I assure you if we could just be alone for a minute, I could 'splain if I could get in a wordge in edgewise.
Yeah, just let him get a "wordge" in edgewise and he'll "'splain.
" Well, yeah, all right.
See if he's got a gun, Eleanor, and be careful.
He's clean.
That's what they say on Line Up.
Well, you, uh, take this and guard them, and be careful now.
All right, Ricardo, come with me.
Look out with that thing, lady, now.
Right over there.
Through that door, and keep your hands up.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I'm an orchestra leader.
Yes.
Right in there, please.
Oh, boy, I could never be a gangster.
I don't have the arms for it.
You know, Lucy, now that I get a chance to look around this room, it really is beautiful.
Oh, I know, it's the most charming house I've ever seen, and you should see the den in the upstairs.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, don't mention it.
Oh, and it's authentic early American.
Yes, it's over a hundred years old.
You won't find beamed ceilings like that in the houses that they build today.
No kidding, a hundred years old, huh?
Ethel, did you see the fireplace?
Yes, I did.
And there's one in the master bedroom, too.
And oh, the kitchen.
You ought to see the kitchen, Ethel.
It's a dream.
Lucy, I don't blame you for wanting to move out here.
Isn't it wonderful?
Beautiful.
It's all right, Eleanor.
Mr. Ricardo has just convinced me they're not really gangsters.
But you wouldn't believe some of the other things his dizzy wife and her crackpot friends have done.
Well, are you sure he's telling the truth, Gerald?
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, I'm sure for one thing that accent isn't phony.
I could hardly understand his explanation.
But how about that gun?
Just a water pistol, see?
Just a water pistol.
It belongs to our little son.
I'm sorry I'm sorry about all the misunderstanding, and I think it's very, very nice of you to let me keep the check.
It's quite all right.
Uh, Ricky, honey.
Yes, dear?
What, dear?
Give him the check back, honey.
What?
!
I want the house after all.
Oh, no!
Oh, please, honey, I just got to have it.
Oh Please?
Are you sure this time?
I'm positive.
Mr. Spaulding, is the house still for sale?
Yes, it's still for sale, but it'll cost $500 more.
$500 more?
!
Yes.
You frightened Eleanor and me out of our wits.
It'll cost exactly $500 to recover.
All right.
All right, $500 more.
Oh, thank you!
Thank you!
Oh!
I'm sorry.
That'll be $550 more.
Oh.
Happy anniversary, darling.
Honey?
Happy anniversary.

{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
What's the matter, honey?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Oh, honey, it can't be "nothing, nothing.
" You don't pace around at 3:00 in the morning just to put mileage on your new bedroom slippers.
If you want to know the truth, I'm worrying about that new house in the country.
Aw, honey.
Now, there's nothing to worry about.
Mr. Spaulding accepted our offer, the bank's got all the papers, that house is ours.
That's what I'm worrying about- that house is ours.
Isn't it wonderful?
We own a home.
What's so wonderful about it?
You know how much money that house is gonna cost me?
Yeah, it's gonna cost Oh, please, don't say it out loud.
That house is worth it.
Yeah, well.
You realize how many times I'm gonna have to sing "Babalu" to pay for that house?
Oh, well, honey, you don't have to give give all the money at one time.
There's a mortgage.
Oh, dear me, a mortgage.
Well, now, that'll be paid off in 20 years.
: 20 years!
You realize how old we will be in 20 years?
I'll be 56 and you'll be Never mind.
Now, honey, I know how old you are.
I know, but I've been juggling my age for so many years, I've I've kind of forgotten what it is and I want to leave it that way.
I don't know what made me decide to buy that place!
I must have been out of my mind.
You realize all the extra 'spenses we're gonna have?
We're not going to have so many extra "'spenses.
" Oh, not much.
Taxes.
There's lots of taxes in that territory over there.
And then you got all those grounds to keep up and you a big barn house in that place and you got a chicken house.
And what are we going to farm, anyway?
Who do I think I am, old McDougal?
Honey, it's old McDonald, and calm down.
There's the heating.
It takes a lot to heat a big place like that, you know.
And then oh, you gotta buy a new car.
And then the money, the the train going back and forward from Connecticut to New York all the time, that's a lot of money.
Then the furniture.
The furniture.
You know how much it's gonna cost to fill that big house with new furniture?
!
No, now, honey.
No, now, we're gonna use all our of own furniture.
We don't have to buy new.
This will fit perfectly.
Oh, good!
Good!
Thank you.
Now, honey That's a big load off my mind.
Yeah.
Wh-Why don't you go back to bed and just try to relax now, honey?
All right, dear.
Now come on.
All right.
Maybe things will look a lot better in the morning.
Sure they will, honey.
You just got a bad case of homeowners' heebie-jeebies, that's all.
Now, now, relax.
You're right, this, this furniture is nice.
Sure, it's fine.
This will look good there.
Sure it will, honey.
It's well-built, this stuff.
Yes, all solid stuff.
That's good.
And we got a lot of pictures and knickknacks and everything.
Yeah, a lot of pictures and everything.
Pleasant dreams, darling.
Thank you, honey.
Go right to sleep.
We won't have to buy anything, maybe.
No, honey, nothing.
That's good.
What's the matter, honey?
Nothing, nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
You don't get up at 4:00 in the morning for nothing.
What's wrong?
Well, maybe we can't afford that house in the country.
Now, dear, calm down, honey, calm down.
How can you be calm with a mortgage staring you in the face?
That house won't be ours for 20 years.
Oh, now, honey, now, now.
It's nothing to cry about.
Oh, no?
I just figured out how old I'll be in 20 years!
Now, now, you just relax, honey.
You were right, honey.
You were right.
We just got a bad case of homeowners' jeebie-heebies, Yeah.
that's all.
We got the jeebie-heebies all right.
Sure.
Come on, honey.
Go back to bed, dear.
Oh We'll work out something, honey.
Are you sure?
Sure, dear.
We'll manage somehow.
Good night, honey.
Good night.
Maybe I can get a hit record or something.
You never had one before.
That's right, well.
Good night, dear.
Good night.
Now, you're sure, honey, that we're doing the right thing?
Positive.
We bought the house, we are going to keep it and we're going to be very happy living in the country.
Oh, I'm glad you feel that way because I feel just the same way about it.
Good.
I'm all ready!
Ready for what?
Ready to move to the country.
Ready to move to the country?
Well, we're not moving yet, partner.
We're not?
No.
No.
Not yet, Fred.
When are we going, Daddy?
Well, in about a week or so.
Well, honey, you shouldn't put Fred in a bag like that.
Here, you go on out in the kitchen and give him his breakfast, okay?
Okay, Mommy.
Okay.
He's ready to move to the country.
Can't hardly wait.
He's gonna be a farmer.
Hi!
Oh, hi, Fred.
Hi, Fred.
How are you?
Fine.
I hate to bring this up, but do you remember this?
: For goodness sake.
What's that?
Our 99-year lease.
Ho, ho!
If you recall, I gave it to you two years ago in a sudden fit of friendliness.
Now, don't tell me that you're gonna make us stay here for 97 more years.
Of course not.
Oh, well, thank you, Fred.
That's very decent of you, friend.
Now, there's just one thing.
What's that?
Since I've let you off the hook for I'd like permission to let me show the apartment for two or three days before you leave.
Sure.
Oh, sure, that'll be fine, Fred.
Of course I'm not gonna barge in on you.
I'm, uh, gonna give plenty of notice.
Okay.
Oh, any time at all.
Thank you very much.
Okay, Fred.
Good-bye.
Thank you.
Oh, gee, what a sweet guy.
Yeah, he's the the nicest landlord in the world.
Sure.
Mm.
Wonder who that is.
I don't know.
Hi!
Well, I've given you notice.
I'm showing your apartment!
Come right in, folks.
Oh.
These are the Ricardos.
H- How do you do?
Mr. And Mrs. Taylor.
How do you do?
How do you do?
I hope we're not barging in.
Oh, no.
That's perfectly all right.
Not at all, no.
This apartment is a perfect love nest for newlyweds.
Oh, yes, it certainly is.
Oh, are you newlyweds, too?
Not exactly.
That's our Ricky.
It's a little chilly in here.
Is it always this cold?
Well Oh, mercy, no!
The Ricardos like it this way.
If there's one thing I give my tenants, it's plenty of heat!
What is all that?
Oh, who knows?
This is only from one closet.
Boy, what you can accumulate after 15 years.
Yep.
You want me to help you, honey?
Yeah.
Will you put all this stuff over there in that big box?
I want to give it to the Salvation Army.
All right, dear.
Hi, fellas.
Hi.
Hi!
Hi!
Guess what?
What?
We rented your apartment.
No!
To the newlyweds you met yesterday.
Oh, they were so nice.
Gee, I hope they're gonna be as happy in here as Ricky and I have been.
Yeah.
We sure had 15 wonderful years in this apartment.
: Oh Oh, Ethel, not again.
Oh, I can't help it.
Oh Oh Dry up, honey.
We've got a problem to settle.
Yes, I know.
I know.
What's the problem, Fred?
Well, the Taylors will, uh, move in only if they can have the apartment right away.
Tomorrow.
Yeah.
Oh, that's impossible!
We can't get into our house for four more days.
That's right, Fred, you know, we can't move until the papers are all signed and that won't be till Friday.
We can't possibly move now.
That's the thanks I get for being so nice.
What's so nice about trying to throw me out of my own apartment?
Did I or did I not tear up a lease of yours that had 97 more years to run?
Yeah, so?
Do you know how much I saved you by being a good- hearted schnook?
Here, look at these figures.
$125 a month rent for 97 years comes to $145,500!
Oh, oh no!
Yeah.
So that's what you sat up all night figuring!
Yep.
Well, Fred, that's very nice of you, but we can't possibly move out so fast.
Listen, I'm saving you almost 150 grand.
The least you could do would be to move out a couple of measly days ahead of time.
Now, just a minute, Fred!
Oh, now, wait a minute, fellas, there's no problem.
It's just for four days.
You can move in with us.
Well, thanks a lot, Ethel, but what are we gonna do with all of our furniture?
Yeah, it'd be ridiculous to store this for only four days.
That's no problem, either.
The Taylors like your furniture so much, they want to buy it.
Buy it?
!
Oh, no, no, we're not gonna sell our furniture.
Wait, wait, wh-why not?
Why not?
Because we're gonna use it in our new house!
This tacky stuff, it'll never fit in our new house.
What are you talking about?
Just just the other night, you told me it was beautiful furniture, that it'd fit in there just perfect.
Well, honey, that was before I knew anyone was foolish enough to want to buy it.
We can buy all-new furniture.
Now just a minute, just a minute.
Do you realize how much money it will cost to furnish that whole new house with new furniture?
Are you gonna quibble about a few sticks of furniture when you just made $150,000?
No no.
All right.
I know when I'm licked.
Come on, honey.
Fred can bring the rest of this stuff.
Okay.
Well, Ethel, this is it.
This is what?
I'll never see this apartment again.
Oh, now, let's not get sentimental.
It's just another apartment.
Just another apartment?
There's 15 years of memories here.
Yeah, I know.
Do you remember the day I got locked in the trunk right there?
Remember the day we were redecorating the apartment and you wallpapered me into the closet?
How about the day the pressure-cooker exploded?
It took us two days to get the chicken fricassee off the ceiling!
Ooh, I've got to cut this out.
I haven't cried so much since the day I got married.
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
You go ahead, Ethel.
I'll be right over.
Okay.
Oh.
Oh, we're sorry, Mrs. Ricardo.
We thought you'd already gone.
Oh, that's all right.
I was just leaving.
Um, I'll, I'll get all these boxes out of here soon.
No hurry.
My husband made a list of all the furniture- this is the inventory- here.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
I'll go over it and I'll give your husband a check this afternoon.
Well, we'll be in the apartment across the hall if you want to see us about anything.
We sure do appreciate your selling us the furniture.
Saved us a lot of expense and trouble.
Well, we were glad to do it.
I, uh I sure hope you're going to be happy here- as happy as we've been.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Honey, that pink shade will go just fine on this lamp.
Pink shade?
Yes.
I've got a lovely pink shade that my mother gave me, and it'll look beautiful on this lamp.
Oh.
Well, um this, uh, this shade was made especially for this lamp, and it's only two years old.
It's very nice, but I really think the pink shade will look better.
Oh.
Uh, would you mind terribly if-if I took this lamp off the inventory?
I'd I'd kind of like to buy it back.
I guess that'd be all right with us, huh?
I guess so.
Oh, thank you.
We can buy another lamp.
Thank you very much.
You were right, dear.
This table will look stunning painted black.
Oh, sure!
Black?
Yeah.
Black?
This is getting to look like the Will-Call Department at Macy's!
Oh, now, Fred, it's just for four days.
Why do you have to grumble so much?
Because grumbling is my hobby.
Like nagging is yours.
Oh, honestly, Fred.
Hey, you got room for these?
Why, honey, I thought the Taylors bought those things.
Well, they did, but they were gonna ruin them, so I bought them back.
Oh.
Well, I guess we can make room.
Yeah, we can move out.
Now, Fred.
I guess there's room for that table in the kitchen.
Come on, give me a hand here, will you, Ethel?
Sure, yeah.
Come on.
There's room in the kitchen.
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Excuse me.
Huh?
I wonder if I could borrow Mr. Mertz's saw.
Saw?
My wife wants to cut the legs off the sofa.
Cut off its legs?
!
It was my wife's idea.
I think I'd better have a little talk with your wife.
Fred?
Oh, Fred.
I'm over here.
Where shall I put this desk chair?
How about back in your old apartment?
Oh, now, Fred, I got the desk.
I might as well have the chair.
Lucy, please don't buy back any more of your old stuff.
Don't worry, I won't.
Oh, thank goodness.
There's nothing else left.
Where's Ethel and Little Ricky?
They went to the delicatessen to get some sandwiches.
Sandwiches?
Yeah.
After the way we've been working, I was kind of looking forward to a hot meal.
Yeah, so was I, but the kitchen is so jammed full of stuff Ethel couldn't find the stove.
Oh, come now, Fred.
She could see it all right, but she couldn't reach it.
Aah.
Come on, I fixed a little nook back in here where we can have something to eat.
Oh.
We're gonna be a little cramped, but we'll have to make it do.
Just so I get to sit down for a few minutes.
There's a place for you.
Where is everybody?
LUCY : Over here in the breakfast nook.
Where?
Here!
Where?
Here!
Oh.
Where's Little Ricky?
Here I am, Mommy!
Here he is.
Oh.
Come on here, honey.
Go right through there, honey.
Come in this way.
Right in through there.
Careful.
Don't bump your head, sweetheart.
Hurry up, Ethel, I'm starved!
I'll be right there.
Here you are, honey.
Take your coat and hat off.
Can I help you, Ethel?
Yeah, you can come and get the milk.
Okay.
Oh.
I guess I'd better back up.
Thanks.
Okay.
Ethel, where's my mustard?
Oh, I forgot it.
I'll have to go out in the kitchen and get it.
Oh.
Oh!
Fred wants the mustard.
Oh.
Well, here, you take this.
I'll get the mustard.
Honey, you'd never be able to find it.
I'll have to get it.
Oh.
Okay?
Kind of crowded.
Make it?
Whoop!
Well, hi, what's new?
Mommy?
I'm coming, honey.
There you are.
There's your milk, honey.
I want chocolate milk.
You want chocolate milk?
Oh, I thought that you wanted plain milk.
I'll go get it.
Well, no, no, honey, I don't think you're gonna be able to find it.
I'll have to go with you.
Oh, he wants chocolate milk.
Oh, well, back up, honey.
Then you can get it.
Well, Ethel, you back up.
I backed up the last two times.
Ethel, where's my mustard?
I got a hungry husband.
Well, I got a thirsty child.
Back up.
Okay.
There we are.
Now, now, honey, don't bump your head.
There we are.
No, this is the wrong mustard.
I wanted hot mustard!
If you want hot mustard, you go get it yourself!
Lucy, would you mind backing up?
I want hot mustard on my sandwich and I'm starved!
Well, Fred, you back up.
I have a thirsty child.
Little Ricky, where are you?
Here, Mommy.
How'd you get back there?
I took a shortcut under the furniture.
He took a shortcut under the furniture!
Isn't that cute?
Do you mind if I play through?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Hello, Moby.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Oh, I forgot the salt.
Back up, Fred.
You back up.
I will not.
Well, neither will I. Well, we'll just see about that.
Now come on!
All right, we will see about that!
Oh, Fred, come on!
Back up!
You back up!
Come on now.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Why push me?
I'm an innocent bystander.
Come on now, Ethel, back up.
No.
Fred?
No!
We could starve to death this way.
Oh, okay, I give up.
Let's eat.
So stubborn.
Stubborn?
Lucy?
How are you gonna explain all this to Ricky?
Explain all what?
About buying all your old furniture back.
Listen, I convinced him it was right to sell it, so I'll convince him it was right to buy it back.
You know I have Ricky trained.
He's putty in my hands.
Lucy!
Speak of the putty.
: Lucy, where are you?
Lucy!
Lucy, where are you?
Come out here!
Lucy, I want to speak to you!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Oh, hi, Fred.
Hi.
Where'd she go?
She took the shortcut to the kitchen.
You stool pigeon!
You come here.
I want to talk to you.
No.
Come right here!
I want to talk to you.
No!
Not till you calm down.
All right, I can take the shortcut, too.
Ah, ah, aha!
All right, start explaining.
Well, the Taylors were ruining our furniture, so I bought it all back.
You bought it all back?
!
They wanted to put a pink shade on our lamp.
They wanted to cut the legs off our sofa.
The phone is ringing, Fred.
And they wanted to paint our table black.
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Where's the phone?
They were ruining everything I'll find it.
Look for the phone!
I'll talk to you later.
No.
Hello?
Hello?
That's Little Ricky's phone.
Oh.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mr. Ricardo.
Oh, hello, Mr. Spaulding.
All right, fine.
Well, we're planning to move in four days.
Yes, sir.
What?
They have?
It was?
Oh Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Well, thanks for calling.
Good-bye.
What'd he say?
The title search for the house has been delayed.
We will have to stay here two more weeks.
Eww Oh, now, honey Honey Now   "I Love Lucy" starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz has been presented for your pleasure by Instant Sanka, the hearty coffee you can drink as strong as you like, it still can't upset your nerves.
"I Love Lucy" is a Desilu production.
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz will be back next week at this same time.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Gee, Ethel, this place has been in such a mess for the last two weeks, I bet you'll be glad to get rid of us.
Aw, Lucy, how can you be like that?
We just loved having you.
Thank you, dear.
This the last of it, ma'am?
Yes, that's it.
Thank you.
Honey, we'll take these two bags in the car, huh?
Okay.
Car?
What car?
Oh, didn't Ricky tell you?
We rented a station wagon to use in the country till we get settled.
Station wagon, huh?
Pretty snappy.
Yeah, I'm going to be a regular country square.
Honey, it's country squire.
Well, whatever it is, you know, we're gonna be real suburbaneeties.
Suburbaneeties?
He means "suburbanites.
" Oh.
I just hope we can cross the border into Connecticut without a passport.
Oh, never mind.
Get your coat, honey.
It's time for us to go.
Remember now, you two, no more bawling.
That's right, Lucy.
This isn't good-bye.
It's just toodle-oo.
Yeah.
Toodle-oo  Oh, no, there she goes again.
Come on now, honey, buck up.
Yeah, honey, they'll come out and see us real soon.
Well, I hope so.
Look, Ethel, here's the key to our house.
You two feel free to use it any time.
Our house is your house.
Oh, thank you, honey.
Thanks, Lucy.
And here's a key to this apartment.
You use it any time you're in town.
Our apartment is your apartment.
Oh, thank you, Ethel.
Thank you, Ethel.
Thanks, Fred.
That's very nice of you.
Well, come on, Little Ricky.
Okay, Mommy.
We're ready.
Okay, sweetheart.
Aw, good-bye, little doll.
Mmm And good-bye, Freddie.
Bye, Lucy.
Good-bye, Ethel.
I mean, toodle-oo.
Well I guess this is it, Fred, huh?
Rick, old man, I sure hate to see you go, not just because you paid your rent on time but because you've been a wonderful friend.
Thank you, Fred.
You've been kind of wonderful yourself.
Thank you, Ricky.
We sure had a wonderful 15 years.
We sure did.
Well so long, everybody.
Lucy?
: I don't want to go.
Honey, get ahold of yourself there.
Yes, now.
You just march right through that door and don't look back.
I'm proud of you, Ethel.
You, you, you didn't even whimper.
Well, now, honey, isn't this a wonderful house?
Boy, I'll say.
Come on, Fred, I'll show you the kitchen.
Show him where he's gonna sleep.
There you are.
Well, it's nice being of service to you, Mr. Ricardo.
I hope you folks enjoy your new home.
Thank you very much.
Thanks a lot.
Well, here we are.
No more tears, honey?
Oh, no.
I'm fine now that we're here.
Gee, isn't this exciting?
We're in our very own home.
The first house we ever had.
Our first house.
Come here.
Where you going?
Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
What are you doing, honey?
LITTLE  Hey!
Why are you doing that, Daddy?
Well, you see, that's a It's a tradition, son.
When, uh whenever you bring someone you love into a new home, you carry them across the threshold.
And that is the threshold.
See?
Oh.
That's a very sweet thing to do, honey.
Come on, Fred, I'll show you my room.
Yeah, show him your room.
Isn't that sweet?
Oh, gee, honey, I just can't believe we're really here.
You know, we should be awfully happy in this house.
It's so quiet and peaceful.
Yeah, no noise.
No dust.
No traffic.
No Mertzes.
Oh, now, now.
Package for Mr. and Mrs. Ricardo.
Oh, isn't that nice?
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
Here.
Here you are.
Thanks.
Welcome to Westport.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Isn't that nice?
Who could have sent that?
There's a card there, I think.
"Lots of happiness in your new home from your dear friends, Fred and Ethel.
" Oh, how about that?
Oh, wasn't that sweet of them?
Oh, boy, this must have set Fred back ten bucks.
You know, they must feel just as sad as we do.
Sad?
For Fred to spend $10 on a basket of fruit, he must have been hysterical.
Where are you going, honey?
I'm gonna call up and thank them right now.
Well, honey, the phone is not connected.
Oh, that's right.
Hey, let's drive in and thank them right now.
Drive in?
We just drove out.
We got a lot of unpacking to do, honey.
Let's get going.
Yeah, you're right.
Where should we start?
Well, let's start right here.
Oh, boy.
After all that unpacking, I can sure use a good night's sleep.
Me, too.
Hey, we ought to sleep real good here- no city noises.
Yeah, it should be nice and quiet for a change.
Good night, honey.
Good night.
You think I'd better put another blanket on Little Ricky's bed?
Oh, no, honey.
The furnace keeps this house nice and warm.
Okay.
What are you laughing at?
This is the first time in 15 years that I haven't had to call Fred and ask him for more heat.
Oh, that's right.
Oh, Fred and Ethel, I sure do miss them.
Now, now, honey.
Good night.
Good night.
Ricky?
Huh?
Are you asleep?
No.
It sure is quiet out here.
Yeah, nice and quiet.
I never heard so much quiet.
Well, you'll get used to it.
Good night.
If you ask me, it's a little too quiet.
I know what you mean.
I wish a taxi would go by or something.
Or a fire engine.
One of those lovely, rattly garbage trucks.
Well, let's try to get some sleep, dear.
Good night.
Ricky?
Yeah?
This quiet is so loud, I can't sleep.
Well, force yourself.
What's that?
I don't know.
Move over.
What is that?
Well, it sounds like a squirrel on top of the roof.
I think.
A squirrel?
I think.
LITTLE  Mommy!
Daddy!
What's the matter, son?
I'm scared.
Scared?
Well, it's nothing to be scared of.
Move over, Daddy.
Move over, dear.
What have you got in there?
Fred.
He's scared, too.
Oh, dear.
Aw He's got Fred with him.
Oh Come on, Fred.
Fred.
Lie down, Fred, now, come on.
Everybody go to sleep now.
Come on, Fred.
Isn't it funny how you get used to sleeping around noise?
Yeah.
They say it's even better when you get used to sleeping around quiet.
Maybe I could sleep better if you took up snoring.
How can I take up snoring if I can't fall asleep?
Well, you sure got a point there.
Ah, well Hey, we sure could use some help around here.
We sure could use some help.
Ethel!
Honey, Ethel is not there anymore.
Oh, my goodness, I forgot.
Well, after 15 years, it's kind of hard to break a habit.
What's in this box here?
That's Ricky's stuff- books and toys and things- they go upstairs.
Oh, this is heavy.
Oh, I'll help you, dear.
No, it's too heavy for you to carry, honey.
I'll just go across the hall and get Fred isn't over there anymore, either.
I forgot, too.
Come on, help me in the kitchen, honey.
All right.
I'll be right there, honey!
Who are you talking to?
I thought I heard Lucy calling me.
Oh, good grief, Ethel.
Get hold of yourself.
They've gone, so we'll just have to get used to it.
I know.
Yeah.
Hey, there's a great fight at the Garden Saturday night.
I wonder who could get me some passes.
Where were you going?
No place.
Oh, yes, you were.
You were going over to see Ricky, weren't you?
Certainly not.
I was going around to see Mrs. Trumbull.
Oh, sure, Mrs. Trumbull always has passes to the fights.
You don't have the monopoly on missing people, you know.
Oh, dear.
Aw, there, there, honeybunch.
Oh, I know Harry, it was so nice of you to invite Little Ricky to stay overnight at your house.
Oh, he and Billy will have a great time.
I'm sure they will.
Now, you be a good boy, sweetheart, and mind Mrs. Munson.
Yes.
All right, sweetheart.
Good luck.
Have a good time.
Bye-bye, darling.
Bye!
Bye!
Good night.
Now, don't worry about him.
We'll take good care of him.
Okay.
All right.
Well, here we are.
Yup, here we are.
Just the two of us, all alone in the country.
Yup, all alone in the country.
What do we do, all alone in the country?
I don't know.
I got an idea.
What?
Let's go to the city.
Go to the city?
What are we going to do there?
Well, we could have dinner and maybe see a show and and if we have time, or just happen to be in the neighborhood we're going to see the Mertzes!
What do you think we're gonna do?
Hey, that's a wonderful idea.
I'll check the train schedules.
Okay.
Gee, I'm dying to see them.
I wonder if they've changed.
Changed?
We only left them a day and a half ago.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, we missed that train, but there's another one in two hours.
Well, let's drive.
No, I think it's going to snow.
I don't want to take a chance.
We'll leave the car at the station and call them from there to see if they're home.
Did you find a good movie?
No, there's nothing around.
Oh.
Well, you want to watch some television?
Not tonight.
Want to play some gin rummy?
Uh-uh.
I don't feel like it.
Well, I suppose we could just sit and talk.
Okay.
Who will we talk to?
To each other.
Oh, come now, Ethel.
Well, there must be something we can do.
Fred, are you willing to be a good sport?
What are you suggesting?
Let's go out to the country and see the Ricardos.
Ethel, that's the greatest idea you ever had.
I'll check and see if they're home.
Oh, no, don't call them.
Let's surprise them.
They're bound to be home.
Where would you go in the country?
I'll look up the schedule and see what time the next train goes.
Ooh, it's so windy.
It's cold, too.
You call the Mertzes.
I'm going to fix my hair.
It's a mess.
All right, dear.
Some wind, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, we'd better call the Ricardos.
Oh, no, let's take a taxi and surprise them.
Now, listen, I spent two bucks on taxi fare to Grand Central, $6.16 on train tickets.
Isn't that surprise enough?
Come on, ask him to drive over and to pick us up.
Oh, all right.
Somebody's using the phone.
Um, mister, is there another phone around here?
There's one out on the platform.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
All right.
Well, what'd they say?
They're not home.
Not home?
Oh, the operator must have been ringing the wrong number.
No.
That's what I thought at first.
I asked her to ring it again and nobody answered.
Oh, what'll we do now?
Go home and go back to sleep.
At 8:30?
Listen, I didn't get any sleep last night listening to that quiet.
Oh  Well?
I couldn't use the phone.
Some teenager was talking to her girlfriend about that Elvis what's-his-name.
You can use that phone over there now.
Fred, you call them.
I want to fix up just a little, huh?
All right.
Oh, how do you like that?
Well, a flat tire.
Well, call a garage.
Somebody using the phone.
Oh.
Have you got a garage out here that I can call?
I got a flat tire.
Yeah, but they all close at 6:00.
Oh, dear.
How are we gonna get home?
Hey, you're in luck, mister.
A cab just drove up.
Oh, good.
Come on, honey.
Thank you.
I'll take care of the car in the morning.
From the back, that man looks just like Fred Mertz.
You're lonesomer than I thought.
Well?
Well, first the operator couldn't find their number, and then she discovered that their phone hasn't been connected yet.
Then we'll have to take a taxi.
Well, okay.
Mister, where's the cab stand?
Right out there.
The cab just left.
Good.
What do you mean, good?
Well, it's not far.
We can walk.
Walk?
It's cold out there!
Walking in the cold air is very healthy.
Since when?
Since now.
Come on.
Oh, Fred.
I can open it.
Good thing she gave me a key.
Yeah.
Ethel, the car is not in the garage, the house is dark- they're not home.
Why are we coming in?
To wait for them.
What else do you suggest?
We'll walk back to the station and go home.
Walk way back there?
!
Over my dead body.
Don't tempt me, Ethel.
Oh, pooh.
Gee, the place is shaping up nicely.
Yeah, isn't it?
There's that basket of fruit we sent them.
Yeah.
Well, we might as well get some return on our investment.
That wind makes it seem kind of spooky out here, doesn't it?
It certainly does.
Gee, these new shoes hurt.
When you spend $16 for shoes, they're not supposed to hurt.
You don't buy $16 shoes for comfort, you buy them for looks.
Then you ought to walk on your hands so people can see your feet.
Oh, dry up, will you?
Sure.
Ooh Ah-ha.
Ricky.
Hmm?
Ricky.
Hmm?
Ricky, wake up.
Yes, what?
I heard something downstairs.
What?
I heard something downstairs.
You must have been dreaming, then.
No, I distinctly heard a noise downstairs.
It's the wind.
There's a lot of wind outside.
Would the wind blow the lights on?
What, the lights?
The lights are on.
The lights downstairs?
We got burglars.
Burglars, honey?
Come on.
Yeah?
Shh!
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
What was it?
There's someone upstairs.
It must be a burglar.
Let's get out of here.
It must have been your imagination.
I just forgot to turn out the lights, that's all.
Did you forget to turn out the fruit?
See, someone has been here.
Maybe they're outside.
: Get the flashlight.
: Come on, I think he's gone.
Hurry up, Fred.
It's so cold.
Well, honey, if anybody was here, they're gone.
Maybe they were just hungry or something.
Yeah, maybe that's right.
Go get 'em, Ricky, go get 'em.
I don't want to go get them.
Well, you were looking for 'em.
Yeah, but I didn't want to find them.
Hide in there.
This is the most ridiculous thing I've heard of.
I paid 16 bucks for those shoes and we're not leaving them here.
Hurry up!
Out of my way, Ethel!
Out of my way, Ethel!
Ethel?
!
Ethel!
Ethel!
Lucy!
Fred!
Ricky!
Oh, my goodness.
We thought you were burglars.
We were just coming in to visit you.
Oh, honey, we came out here to see you and surprise you.
We missed We missed you so.
Oh, Lucy, we missed you so much.
Oh, there they go again.

{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Breakfast ready, honey?
Lucy?
Oh, there you are.
Oh, good morning, darling.
Where you been?
Well, we were out of bread, so I went next door to the Ramseys' to borrow some.
Oh.
Oh, gee, that Betty Ramsey is a nice person.
And so is Ralph, her husband.
You're just gonna love him.
We're sure lucky to have such good neighbors.
Look, honey, uh I don't think it's a good idea to get too friendly with the neighbors too fast.
Why not?
We're gonna be living here the rest of our lives.
Why shouldn't we get friendly with the neighbors right away?
That's just it.
We are gonna be here for the rest of our lives, so I think that we get that we should get chummy gradually.
Oh, well, maybe you can get chummy gradually.
With me, it's instant chummy.
Well, I still say that you shouldn't rush into friendships.
Oh, pish-tush.
There you are, some nice, neighborly toast.
I'll have some nice, unneighborly jelly.
Okay, dear, I'll get it.
Thank you.
Gee, you should see the Ramseys' house.
It's all done in the most beautiful early American.
I'm getting some wonderful ideas from Betty for redecorating our house.
In the far distant future, of course.
Here you are, doll.
Thank you.
Blech!
Tush-sheesh!
Ugh!
Why don't you ask me what's the matter?
I can't afford to ask you what's the matter.
Honey, our old furniture looks just awful in our beautiful new house.
What are you talking about?
When we bought this house, you said that our furniture would look perfect in here.
Well, we haven't got enough furniture for this big place.
Aw, gee, honey, please, can't I buy just one new thing?
All right, I guess we could afford one new thing.
What's it gonna be?
One house full of furniture.
One downstairs full of furniture?
One living room full of furniture?
Oh, if you put some seeds in you head, you could use it for a maraca.
Look, Lucy, we just cannot afford a lot of new furniture right now.
But this stuff looks so awful.
Look, why can't we put all this in the den and then all we'd need is just a few basic things, you know, like a a table and a lamp and a little old rug.
Oh, please, honey, please?
All right, all right.
You can buy $500 worth of furniture and not a penny more.
Oh, thank you, honey.
Thank you so much.
All right.
Well, good morning, Bruce.
Hello.
Hi.
Honey, you know Bruce Ramsey?
Oh, yeah.
Hi, Bruce.
Hi.
Is Little Ricky here?
Yes, sweetheart.
He's here.
He's upstairs.
Go on up.
Little Ricky, Bruce is here!
Hi, Ramsey.
Hi, Ricardo.
Oh, isn't that cute?
Ramsey and Ricardo.
How about that.
I got to go.
I got to catch the 9:20.
Oh, okay, darling.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Good-bye, honey.
Now, only $500.
I know, $500.
I have it engraved right here.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Oh!
Come on in, Betty.
Hi!
Hi, dear.
Lucy, guess what.
What?
You remember your telling me about wanting to buy new furniture?
Yes.
Well, I just talked to Ralph on the phone and he's arranged for us to go to a wholesale furniture place this afternoon.
Oh, how wonderful!
And I just talked to Ricky and he said, "Go ahead, buy a few things.
" Oh, good!
How about that?
You want some coffee?
I'd love some.
Oh, really, they have simply gorgeous things at this place, and I can get you 40% discount on everything you buy.
Oh, that's great!
Let's see, 40% of five of, uh of what Ricky said I could spend Why, I can get almost twice as much as I thought I could.
Oh, you're so lucky, Lucy.
You know, most husbands would raise quite a fuss if their wives wanted to redecorate.
Ricky must be very generous.
Oh, yes, he is very generous in his own little way.
Of course, someone in Ricky's position doesn't have to worry about money.
No.
Well, now, let's see.
Um we'll do the whole living room and dining room in early American.
We will?
The whole thing?
Oh, well, I, uh I kind of wanted to keep a couple of the old pieces for sentimental reasons, you know.
Oh, no, no, no, dear, you don't want to mix this beat-up old stuff with your lovely new things.
Well, I don't want to, but You know what we should do with this?
Set fire to it?
No, trade it in, get an allowance on the new furniture.
That way, you'll save even more money.
Trade it in!
That's a great idea!
Now, I think we should put two wing chairs here.
Two wing chairs, yeah.
And a big sofa here maybe even two sofas.
Two sofas!
Yes.
Now, let's see.
we picked out the whole dining room set, the buffet, the two chairs the couch, the bench, end tables Uh, now, we decide on a coffee table.
Uh-huh.
Well, how about this one?
Yes, yes.
That's very nice.
How about that one over there, Betty?
Could be.
Uh, yeah, now that I get a better look at this, this is fine.
Yes, I like that.
I like the shape there.
Mm-hmm.
Now, lamps.
That's attractive.
Oh, isn't it?
Yes.
Uh how about that one over there?
Sometimes at parties, our friends like to try on lampshades for hats.
I was just making sure it was the right size.
Oh, Lucy, you're such a clown.
Yeah, well Say, you know, Betty, I can't get over how inexpensive all this furniture is.
What do you mean, dear?
Mr. Perry hasn't quoted prices yet.
Oh, well, I just casually happened to glance at some of the price tags, and there's some real bargains here.
Price tags?
Yeah.
You know, like, for instance, here's one right here.
See, this table is $10.62.
Oh, Lucy, there you go clowning.
Those aren't price tags.
They're stock numbers.
Stock numbers?
!
Uh, Mrs. Ramsey, Yes.
I've, uh, been going over Mrs. Ricardo's purchases, like you asked me to, and the furniture that she has selected so far less the 40% discount, of course, and the allowance on her old furniture comes to exactly $1,875.50.
We like to do these little favors for our friends.
$1,875.50?
That price is fantastic.
You can say that again.
Now, Mr. Perry, do you have any more lamps besides this because I don't think any of these are right for Mrs. Ricardo.
I have just the thing for you.
Look, Betty	 Oh, good.
Betty maybe I shouldn't have rushed into this.
Maybe I shouldn't buy so much all at once.
Maybe I should just buy a-a chair or a lamp or a little old table or something.
But dear, why not buy everything all at once?
Yeah, why not?
Well, because I sort of like to have furniture trickle in one at a time, you know.
Like a Chair-Of-The-Month Club.
Stop clowning, Lucy.
Here we are.
Oh, that's very nice.
Uh, to tell you the truth, Betty, I I I need everything by Saturday night.
Yeah, we're having some friends in Saturday night and if we can't have everything by Saturday night- and I know that's impossible- why, then I'm afraid I won't be able to take any of it.
But just so the afternoon won't be a total loss, I'll, um I'll take this little footstool here.
Saturday night?
Oh, my, that is awfully fast.
Yes, I knew it would be, so if you'd just wrap it up But since you are such a good friend of Mrs. Ramsey's, I'll do it.
Thanks a lot.
Er, this is $24.50.
I'll just put it with your other furniture.
Thank you so much, Mr. Perry.
Oh, come on, Lucy, we've got lots of other things to look at.
We haven't even started on the den yet, dear.
Yeah, why not?
What have I got to lose except my life?
What?
Oh, there I go, clowning again.
Well, here it is, Lucy- all your new furniture.
Yeah, here it is.
I'll bet Ricky raves when he sees this.
He'll rave all right.
Of course you'll still need a few knickknacks and things, but we can get those next week.
Listen, I have to run now, dear, but I'll see you later, okay?
Bye.
Okay.
Okay, Betty.
Bye.
Operator, can I have Schuyler 4-8098, New York City, please?
Hello?
Oh, I'm in terrible trouble.
Can you come out right away?
What's the matter?
What's up?
Who is it?
It's Lucy and she's in trouble!
Quick, hang up!
Oh, Fred.
Is it bad trouble, honey?
Well, Ricky told me that I could spend $500 for some new furniture and I got carried away and I spent over thr I I spent over thr How much?
How much?
I spent over $3,000.
$3,000?
!
What, what, what about $3,000?
Ricky told Lucy she could spend $500 for some new furniture, and she spent over $3,000!
Now, Fred Fred, loosen your collar so you won't faint.
Fred, it's not your money.
Lucy?
What happened to Fred?
Oh, he got lightheaded just thinking about somebody spending $3,000.
Oh, Ethel, can you come out right away?
Maybe Ricky won't be so mad if you're here.
Sure, honey, we'll get on a train just as soon as I can revive Fred.
Oh, thank you so much and hurry, hurry!
Okay, we will.
Bye.
Fred?
Fred?
Fred, come on.
Pull yourself together.
We got to go out to Connecticut.
Three thousand dollars  Oh, good, Fred and Ethel.
I forgot my key, honey  Hey!
What's going on here?
Hey, honey!
Lucy!
My foot's stuck!
I know.
I want to talk to you before I let you in.
Now, listen, Ricky, I've done something awful, and I want to tell my side of the story such as it is, and then when you've had a chance to calm down, I'll let you in.
Now, listen, honey, now, listen.
Uh remember the other day when, when Betty Ramsey took me to that wholesale house and you said that I could spend $500 and when I came home, you asked me if I spent it and I said "yes"?
Well, honey, I I spent a little more.
I didn't mean to, but, uh, I-I-I thought that the price tags- the tags were price tags and they were really stock numbers, see?
And, well, honey Now, honey, get a grip on yourself.
I- I-I spent over $3,000.
I didn't mean to, Ricky.
Really, I didn't.
And I'm not going to let you in now until you promise to calm down, be understanding and talk like a normal human being.
Now, do you promise that, Ricky, do you?
Okay, I promise.
Let me out!
Lucy!
You stay right where you are!
Oh, now, honey, you promised to be calm and understanding.
I am I am calm, and I am very understanding.
Now, we go in there.
We go and sit down in there and-and we'll talk over this whole thing like two normal human beings.
Honey, isn't this pretty what we're sitting on?
See, I I got both, because the room is so big and they match the two chairs and everything.
I bought this 'cause I like the little railings and it spins; you can get things from all sides.
And the rug.
Did you notice the rug : Three thousand dollars!
$3,272.65.
How could you do such a thin'?
!
Well?
Well, um I didn't mean to, but Now, if you look at it another way, dear, we really saved you money, you see, because Betty got them to take our other furniture in on trade, and Betty got us a 40% discount.
Betty.
Yes, Betty.
Do you remember I told you it wasn't right to get too chummy with the neighbors too fast?
Oh, you're not gonna say, "I told you so"?
Yes, I am!
Well, I just thought I'd ask.
But, honey, I still say that Betty did us a big favor.
Uh, do you know how much money we're saving?
Yeah, exactly.
We're saving $3,292.95.
Well, now, why Because all this stuff is going back!
Oh, honey, I can't return all this.
What'll I tell Betty Ramsey?
Just tell her the truth- that we can't afford it.
Oh, I couldn't tell her that.
Why not?
Why, I just couldn't, that's all.
You, you, you tell her.
You go on over and tell her you're a tightwad.
I'm a tightwad?
Well, if the shoe fits You go right over there, you go right over there this minute and tell Betty.
But Ricky Right this minute you go over there and tell her, I'll be upstairs.
Honey?
You, uh, you might notice a few new things up there, too.
Go on!
Go on!
Hi!
Hi!
I'm going into town to pick up a few things.
Anything I can get for you?
No, not another thing.
I saw Ricky come home.
What did he have to say when he saw all the new things?
Couldn't you hear him over at your house?
No.
What do you mean?
Well, as a matter of fact, Betty, I was just on my way over to talk to you.
I'm afraid we're going to have to return all these things.
Return them?
Why?
Well, we just can't I don't think that, uh Well We we just don't think we should We should look at some other furniture before we plunge into buying all this.
Well, Lucy, you might at least have told me this before we took up Mr. Perry's time and had everything sent out.
Yeah, well You know, Betty, now that I see all this furniture here, I don't think it suits the house.
Doesn't suit it?
It's an early American house.
This is early American furniture.
That's just it, it's too pat.
What?
Well, you know what this house needs?
What?
Chinese modern.
Yeah, low black tables and bamboo mats and cushions thrown all around.
We love to eat on the floor.
And, and, and lanterns and screens and a built-in mah-jongg set.
All right, Lucy, why don't you just come right out and say it.
Say what?
You don't like my taste.
Oh, no, Betty, I didn't mean that.
No.
What else could it be?
I'm only trying to be helpful.
Well, that's what I get.
My husband warned me not to get too chummy with the new neighbors, and he was so right.
Huh!
Oh, Betty, but I didn't say that.
I didn't mean that.
You don't understand, Betty.
Betty, listen  Oh, dear.
What's the matter?
Betty Ramsey was just here.
Oh.
You tell her we couldn't afford the furniture?
Oh, I couldn't bring myself to tell her we couldn't afford it, so now she thinks that we don't like her taste and everything's a big mess.
Oh, fine, leave it to two women to get everything fouled up.
All right, I'll go next door and have a man-to-man talk with her husband and just tell him that we cannot afford it, that's all.
All right.
And don't cry on that sofa- that's going back.
Oh!
Mr. Ramsey?
Yes.
I'm Ricky Ricardo from next door.
Our wives have already met.
Oh, hi!
Come on in.
Thank you.
Call me Ralph.
Thank you.
Let's go in the den where we can sit down.
Oh, uh, I haven't got much time.
I just want to talk about something.
Oh?
I was telling the boys down at the agency that I live next door to a big celebrity now.
Uh, what agency are you with?
Burton, Warshman & Ramsey.
Oh!
Are you that Ramsey?
Well, yes, I guess I am.
Talking about you last week out at the country club.
You were?
Mm-hmm.
Proposed your name to the membership committee.
No kidding.
Yeah, of course the dues, the initiation fee are pretty high, but I told them that money doesn't mean a thing to a big star like Ricky Ricardo.
Yeah, well, uh Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Sure.
Yesterday, down at our weekly Think Conference at the agency, I suggested your name for a guest shot on a TV show.
You did?
Yes, and the reaction was tremendous.
Well, how nice.
Are you interested?
Why, sure, I'm always interested in doing guest spots.
Oh, good, good.
Uh, what was it you wanted to talk to me about?
Oh, well, I just wanted to talk to you about the furniture that your wife picked up.
Oh, that's all right.
You don't have to thank me.
I was glad to set it up for you.
How do you like it?
Fine, fine.
Only that, uh Well, it's a little bit high High-priced?
No, no, no, it's not that; it's just high-class, you know.
We, uh We're very earthy people.
You mean you don't like it?
Oh, no, no, it's not that; it's fine.
It's just that Well it's not for us.
What you mean is, it doesn't suit you.
Yes, that's it.
In other words, you don't like my wife's taste.
Oh, no, I didn't say that.
Well, that's what you were inferring.
Well, no, I I didn't infer, I didn't.
Well, I got you a wonderful discount, so it can't be the price.
What is it?
We just want to return it, that's all.
Well, it's impossible.
Why?
Well, I went to a lot of trouble to set up that deal.
I can't ask those people to take it back.
Why not?
Well, I just can't, that's all.
Are you by any chance getting a kickback from this furniture store?
Now, look here, Mr. Ricardo, I don't have to stand here and be insulted.
First you don't like my wife's taste, now you call me a crook.
I think you'd better get going.
Are you throwing me out?
I said, I think you'd better get going.
Who's going to make me?
I am.
You are?
Mm.
Hah!
Would you care to step outside?
I'd love to.
So would I. Good.
Good!
And you can forget about that TV show.
We'll get Cugat.
That does it.
Come on, let's go.
Don't bother to knock.
Just use your key, Fred.
Hurry up.
Hurry up, Fred.
All right.
Do you suppose we beat Ricky here?
I guess so.
There's nothing broken.
My, Fred, isn't all this new furniture beautiful?
Beautiful it is.
$3,000 worth it ain't.
Oh, Fred.
It's too quiet around here.
I don't like it.
Mira que cosa!
Hi!
Mira que cosa!
Oh, my goodness!
If he looks like that, what must Lucy look like?
Oh, Fred and Ethel, you're here!
Not a scratch on her.
Honey!
What happened?
Don't you know?
No!
Honey, what happened to you?
Yo te voy a decir lo que ha pasado y que es esta senora y que es Ralph Ramsey!
What about Ralph Ramsey?
Que nos pusimos en un peleado y me empujo en un rosebush!
What's he saying, Lucy?
What's he saying?
Well, as near as I can tell, our next-door neighbor Ralph Ramsey pushed him into a rosebush.
Why did he do a thing like that?
Well, Ricky went over to tell Ralph Ramsey- that's Betty's husband- that we couldn't afford all this furniture, because when I told Betty we couldn't afford it, she thought that I thought that she had bad taste.
What'd she say?
I got it.
Didn't you?
No.
I was doing better with his Spanish.
What happened to you?
I had a fight with Bruce.
You had a fight with Bruce!
What about?
He said his daddy beat up my daddy.
Is that so?
!
Honey, honey, now calm down.
I'm not going to calm down!
I'm going to Honey, honey I thought people moved to the country for peace and quiet.
Honey, we'll get cleaned up.
Ricardo, I think you owe us an apology!
Look what your boy did to our boy!
What do you mean I owe you an apology?
You owe us an apology!
Look what your boy did to our boy!
I'm not apologizing until you do!
Well, I'm not apologizing until you do.
Well, you started the whole thing.
I did not.
My wife did.
I did?
You inferred you didn't like my taste.
I did not.
And you called me a crook.
No, I did not I didn't call you a crook.
Fellas, keep quiet, please.
Just give me a chance!
Lucy What?
Aren't you going to introduce us?
These are our friends, the Mertzes; our enemies, the Ramseys.
You won't give me a chance!
Oh, you fellas, quiet.
This is all a big misunderstanding.
The real reason for all this trouble is that the Ricardos simply cannot afford all this new furniture.
Is that all?
Why didn't you say so?
Yeah, why didn't you say so?
Me?
I'm just a little boy.
Oh, Lucy why didn't you tell me the truth?
Well, I was too embarrassed to admit it.
Yeah, me, too.
We would have understood.
I've been wanting to redecorate our house for years, but we just couldn't Go ahead, honey, tell them.
We couldn't afford it either.
Hey, Bruce, how about being friends?
Sure.
Want to be mine?
Sure.
Let's go out and play.
Aw Lucy I'm sorry.
Sorry, pal.
Had a nice workout, anyway.
We sure did.
Forget what I said about Cugat.
If you want that job, it's yours.
Well, thanks.
I'll take it.
Hey, Lucy.
Yeah.
Ralph is going to give me a television job in one of his shows.
A guest appearance.
A television job!
Yeah.
Oh, boy, that's wonderful!
Yeah.
It pays $3,500.
$3,500?
Mm-hmm.
$3,500!
Honey, that'll just about, uh Yeah, I know, pay for the new furniture.
Yeah.
All right, all right.

{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Bills, bills, bills!
That's all there is in the mail this morning.
Lucy I'm sorry, I bought it.
I didn't want it anyway, and I'll take it back tomorrow.
No, no, no, honey, it's not you this time.
These are household bills.
Oh, thank goodness.
The house is gonna catch it for a change.
How can we spend so much money?
Listen to this: heating bill- $52, telephone- $23, electric bill- $18.75, water- $16.
How are we gonna pay all these bills?
Well, now, honey, you don't have to pay them all at once.
Look look, I got a system.
See?
We put them all in the lazy Susan like this, see?
Just like that.
Now, we spin it around and any bill that stays on gets paid.
See?
The lucky winner is the Connecticut Light and Power Company.
Lucy, we can't pay our bills by spinning them around on a lousy Susan.
It's a lazy Susan.
Well, whatever it is.
How do you suggest we pay all the unlucky losers?
Well What's this one here?
Groceries- $88!
How can three people eat so much?
It's five people.
Don't forget the Mertzes have been here every weekend, and you know how this country air affects Ethel's appetite.
Well, maybe this weekend you'd better tell Ethel to breathe a little less.
They're only gonna be here one day this time, and, anyway, you know you love having them.
I know, I love having them, honey, but the money just keeps going out and out and What's this?
Tree surgery- $50.
Well, now, honey, you know how sick that poor elm was outside It needed attention.
I know, but $50?
!
I could have had my appendix taken out.
Oh, honey, now, you knew it was gonna cost more living in the country.
I didn't know it was gonna cost this much more.
Well, I'll say one thing for those bills.
They've certainly taken your mind off the $3,000 I paid for the furniture.
Oh, I've forgotten all about that.
Oh, me and my big mouth.
You spent $3,000 for new furniture!
Well, now, honey, it would have cost a lot more if Betty Ramsey hadn't gotten us that discount.
That's another thing.
Oh If Betty Ramsey hadn't taken you to that wholesale house, you wouldn't have spent nearly as much.
Oh, me, I gotta have a talk with my mouth.
Wouldn't you know?
Wouldn't you know that we would just move right next door to somebody like Betty Ramsey?
She's the nosiest, most meddling female that I have ever  Oh, hi, Betty!
Hi, Betty!
How are you, Betty?
Hi, Ricky.
I'm sorry to barge in, but I've got the most wonderful news.
What?
I just talked to this friend of mine who writes for House and Garden magazine, and I told her about your house.
Well, she'd love to see it, and if she likes it, she's gonna do a whole spread of pictures of your house in her magazine.
Oh, Betty, how wonderful.
Isn't that exciting, Ricky?
Yeah, exciting.
Oh-ho-ho, Ricky, and you were worried about Lucy spending all that money for furniture.
: Yeah.
Betty, I don't really have time to talk to you about it but I think it's wonderful.
That's really thrilling news, Betty.
Bye!
Oh, just think, honey.
Maybe we're gonna get a picture of our home in House and Garden.
Yeah, great, and that'll be another expense.
Now we'll have to buy 50 copies of the magazine.
Oh Gee, honey, I guess you're right about it being more expensive living in the country but it doesn't have to be.
What do you mean?
Well, we're not making the country work for us.
You know, we could raise things.
You're right.
First thing we gotta raise is money to pay for these bills.
No, now, I'm serious.
A lot of people around here make extra money by farming.
Now, we could have apple orchards and grape vineyards and maybe some grain and wheat fields and and a herd or two of cattle, maybe.
Lucy, we only own two acres, you know.
What you're talking about would take the entire state of Ay-oh-a-way.
"Ay-oh-a-way"?
Well, how do you think the state of "Ay-oh-a-way" got started?
Farming, huh?
That's right.
Well, maybe we could do a little farming, but it's got to be on a small scale.
Something small, now, something small.
Chickens!
Let's raise chickens.
What about corn?
Why corn instead of chickens?
Well, we'll sleep a lot better.
Corn doesn't crow at 5:00 in the morning.
We'll make a lot more money raising chickens.
Yeah, how do you figure?
Well, chickens lay eggs, right?
I can't argue with you on that.
And eggs are 75 cents a dozen.
That's clear profit right there.
Yeah, well, suppose the chickens stop laying eggs?
Once a chicken is all egged out, you sell it for poultry.
You can't lose.
What about 'spenses?
Oh, what "spenses" are there?
Shelter and some food.
What can a little grain and corn cost?
feed.
Chicken feed.
Well, when you stop cackling who's gonna take care of all these chickens?
Well, what's there to take care of?
As fast as they drop the eggs, we pick them up and put them in the cartons.
Well, it sounds good.
Sure, it's a snap.
And who knows, maybe later on we can train the chickens to lay the eggs right in the cartons.
You know, cut out the middle man.
Well, honey, if the business folds, we can always eat the inventory.
That's true.
Sure.
So we figure that by selling the eggs, and marketing the chickens, we could make a nice piece of change.
And it was all my idea.
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Haven't you ever seen me eat before?
I've never seen you do anything else.
I don't see you going on any hunger strike.
Well, Fred, what do you think of our little scheme?
Well, it sounds pretty good, but you'd better hire somebody with experience to handle it for you.
Well, if we gotta get somebody, then it's out of the question.
We can't afford to hire a hand.
We can't even afford to hire a finger.
You don't have to pay him a salary, Rick.
Let him work, give him a place to live and cut him in for a share of the profit.
Oh, are there people who do that?
Why, sure, we had a man who did just that when I was a little boy on the farm.
Huh.
It's hard to believe Fred was ever on a farm.
It's hard to believe he was ever a little boy.
All right, you two, all right.
You know, Fred, if we could get somebody like that, it might be worth it.
Yeah, it might be profitable for both parties.
Hey, if we got a chicken fellow, he could live in the guest house.
Yeah.
How do you go about getting someone like that?
Well, put an ad in the local paper.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Now, let's see, what will we say?
I had a pencil around here.
What happened to it?
Maybe Ethel ate it.
You write out the ad, Rick, and we'll drop it off at the newspaper on our way to the station.
Okay, now, let's see.
How do we start it, Fred?
Well, you gotta have a tricky heading for the ad.
Something that'll catch their eye.
Uh-huh.
I know.
"Become a millionaire overnight.
" That's a little bit too optimistic, don't you think?
How about "Get rich quick"?
That's still too much.
Why don't you just say "Want to pour your money down a rat hole"?
Now, honey, don't be silly.
Besides, there's no money required.
There's your heading: "No money required.
" That'd sure catch my eye.
"No money required.
" That's good.
"No money required.
" Now, what else?
Wanted "Wanted.
" That's good.
"'Sperienced chicken farmer.
" How do you spell 'sperience?
E- x-p "E-x", you're kidding?
E- x-p-e-r What do you know?
E- x-p Honey, we got some answers to our ad.
Oh, any good ones?
Well, this sounds pretty good, but he's got 12 children.
There's no place to put them all.
Well, don't throw away his address.
He sounds like a great customer for our eggs.
Here's a kid who's going to agricultural college.
Oh, he sounds good.
Well, he's not for us, though.
He's a sophomore, and he wants us to hold the job open until he graduates.
Oh, no.
Here's one I haven't seen yet.
Let's see.
"In answer to your ad, "I present the following qualifications.
"I was born and raised on a farm in the Midwest, "and I'm very familiar with chickens.
"I am an industrious, intelligent and reliable veteran of World War I." Oh, he's an old codger.
"Although my wife and I live in the city, "we're most anxious to return to the simple life.
"Having been in show business "for a long while, I feel especially qualified "for this position since over the years, I have laid many an egg myself.
" He's got a good sense of humor.
Yeah.
"If you're interested, just open your front door.
"My wife and I are waiting "on the porch.
Sincerely yours, Fred H. Mertz.
" Oh, no!
Are they kidding?
Oh!
Fred and Ethel!
I don't believe it.
What is this?
I hear you're looking for a good hired hand.
We almost froze hiding out there.
We thought you'd never come out for the mail.
Oh, honestly.
You mean, this whole thing isn't a joke?
We were never more serious in our lives.
We've been talking about it ever since we left here Saturday.
Just made the decision this morning.
This morning?
Well, how'd your letter get here so fast?
We brought it up with us on the train and stuck it in your mailbox.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Didn't you notice the stamp?
No.
No.
An Easter seal.
You don't think Fred'd waste three cents?
Oh, honey!
Oh, come on in!
I was afraid you'd catch onto it.
Oh, I never had an idea.
Ah, what a nice surprise!
Glad to be here.
Gosh, imagine you two applying for the job.
Why, we never thought of you.
No.
We never thought of us either until after we got to town.
We've been talking about it ever since.
Fred was so excited, he couldn't sleep.
I can top that.
Ethel was so excited, she couldn't eat.
Oh, honey, I just think this is marvelous.
And best of all, if you give us the job, we'll be near you again.
Of course you've got the job.
Fred, do you really know anything about chickens?
Well, for the past 25 years, I've been henpecked.
Remember, Rick, I told you I was raised on a farm.
Well, partner, you got yourself a job.
We're in the chicken business together.
Fine.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Hey, what about your apartment?
Mrs. Trumbull's sister wants to move in and manage the building for us.
Oh, that's wonderful.
She'll move in anytime we give her the high sign.
Well, that's just wonderful.
Then it's all settled, huh?
Lucy, Lucy What?
Well, now, we can't move into the guest house until all of our stuff gets here.
Oh, honey, you can stay in our spare room upstairs.
Oh, good, fine.
Sure.
Well, look, we can start in the chicken business right away.
Let's see now.
What do we want first?
Baby chicks.
Hold it, Lucy.
Hold it.
We got a lot of fixing up to do in that henhouse.
I gotta paint, plaster, put up chicken wire.
That'll take at least a week.
A week?
Yes.
Oh, my.
Well, if we're gonna live with you for a week, before we can go into business together, we want to pay you rent.
Oh, Ethel, no.
No, that's out of the question.
I'll say it is.
Fred, we are paying rent.
Oh, for corn's sake.
What's so funny?
I was just thinking, after all these years, I'm going to be Fred's landlord.
Well, I hope you'll be a good one, Rick.
Well, I'll try to be as good a landlord as you were.
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
Oh-ho-ho!
Brrrr!
Yoo-hoo!
Anybody home?
Just the hired hand, ma'am.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Fred.
Where's Little Ricky?
He's next door, playing with the Ramsey kid.
Oh.
What have you been doing, Fred?
Plastering the cracks in the henhouse all afternoon that you were supposed to help me with.
That's what I've been doing, Fred.
The hired help seems to be getting nastier all the time.
What have you been doing?
Well, we You tell him, Lucy.
Okay.
Well, as you know, Fred, we went into the village to do a little shopping and we just happened to pass the hatchery and we went in to browse.
Well, we just couldn't resist.
Fred, you and Ethel are now the proud parents of 500 baby chicks!
Congratulations, you old rooster.
The same to you, you old hen.
We can have them delivered next week when the henhouse is ready.
Oh, the henhouse is fine, and after all, chickens aren't fussy.
Yeah, we were just down there.
And your little family seems to love it.
Holy mackerel!
Do you mean to tell me that you put 500 baby chicks in that henhouse?
Yeah.
Why not?
Are you crazy?
In this cold weather, they'll freeze their fuzz off.
Well, Fred, they're all in boxes.
Oh but they gotta be kept warm.
Now you phone that hatchery and tell them to send two brooders over here right away.
Two brooders?
Yes.
Right away.
Come on now, you help me bring those chickens in here so they'll stay warm.
Oh, I will, I will.
I never heard of such a thing.
Freeze their fuzz off?
Okay!
Okay, Fred, careful on the step.
Yeah.
Take off the feed, Lucy.
Take the feed.
Gee, it is cold out there.
Whew!
Did you phone the hatchery?
Oh, yes, Fred, I did, but they were already closed.
Oh, my!
What'll we do with them, Fred?
We'll keep them in the house till tomorrow.
Oh, it's a good thing we got this feed.
Uh, where shall we put them?
What's the warmest room in the house?
Well, the den, I guess.
It's right over the furnace.
Well, open the vents in the den and turn the heat up to 90.
Ninety?
Yes, ninety.
We want to raise chickens, not roast them.
Baby chicks have to have a temperature of 90 degrees.
Now, don't stand there and argue.
Turn up the heat.
All right!
All right.
Oh, my, that's the first time in his life Fred's ever said, "Turn up the heat.
" You never did this for me.
You're no chicken, Ethel.
Where's a good place?
Right here.
right here, Fred.
Oh, oh Ooh, ooh Push it over a little bit.
Oh, boy.
Whew!
Hey, let's take the boxes the covers off the boxes.
I'll bet it's very stuffy in here.
I'll go and check the furnace.
We gotta keep these chickens warm.
Okay.
Oh, aren't they the cutest little things you ever saw?
Oh, God love them.
Aren't they funny?
Hello, you little darlings.
Oh, my goodness.
Look at those little things.
Hello, lovie.
They're so soft and sweet.
You can hardly feel one in your hands.
Hey, listen.
They're talking about Fred.
They're talking about Fred?
Yeah, they're saying, "cheap, cheap, cheap.
" Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello!
Gee, I bet they're hungry.
Let's feed them.
Okay.
I'll push this back.
You stay in those boxes till I get ready for you.
Lucy, what are you doing?
I'm setting the table for their dinner.
Don't you just leave them in the boxes?
No, it's too cramped in there.
They gotta have elbow room.
You're gonna let them out?
Yeah, we'll put them all down here.
Sure.
Oh, well, I'll get mine out, huh?
Yeah.
Come on, honey.
Come on, honey.
Come on.
Come and get it!
Come on, honey.
Oh, you're gonna have some food.
Come and get it.
Isn't this fun?
Come on.
Here you go.
Get out there.
Wow-dee-oh!
Wow-dee-yow-dee!
Here you go!
Get out from underneath there.
Come on there, fellas.
Here you go.
Come on.
Here you are.
Get out.
Right over there.
Right over there.
Here you are, get out.
Go, go, go.
Oh, my.
Come and get it!
Over here, come on, fellows.
Over here, over here, over here.
Come on.
Come on.
Here you are.
Oh, careful, Fred, careful.
Careful!
Oh, come on.
Goodness sakes, why'd you let them out?
So they'd have room to eat.
It's crowded in those boxes.
Well, I guess it'll be all right for a few minutes.
It's hot in here now.
Yeah.
Oh, boy, I'll say it is.
Say, watching them eat has made me kind of hungry.
Let's have a little snack, Lucy?
Okay, good idea.
Not till you put those chickens back in their boxes.
Oh, no, Fred, let them eat.
We'll put them back in after we finish.
Good-bye.
Come on, fellas.
Enjoy your dinner.
Have a good time.
There you go, over there.
Over there.
Oh, brother.
Wall-to-wall chickens!
Oh, boy, it was hot in there.
I'll say.
Gee, I don't want to be around when Ricky finds 500 chickens in the den.
I'll tell you one thing.
He's gonna be plenty miserable when he starts reading his newspaper.
What do you want to eat, Ethel?
Oh, just something to nibble on.
How about a chicken leg?
Shh, Ethel!
Oh, I hope they didn't hear you.
I'm sorry, honey.
My gosh.
Most chicken farmers only have foxes to worry about.
We got Ethel, too.
Mommy!
Oh, boy!
Boy, those chicks are noisy little fellows, aren't they?
Yeah, they have strong lungs.
You can hear them all the way from the den.
If I didn't know, I'd swear they were right in the next room.
LITTLE  Mommy, look!
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Oh, yeah, you found them.
Isn't that the sweetest thing?
Did you close the den door, dear?
I don't remember.
You don't remember?
Oh, Lucy!
Oh, no!
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, no wonder they sounded like they were right in the next room.
Quick, open the vents and let in more heat.
Hurry.
Oh, my  Oh, fellas, fellas, come on now.
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
Back to the den.
Oh, dear!
Come on, fellas.
Come on.
Back, back, back.
Back to the den.
Back to the den.
To the rear march!
To the rear march!
Oh, come on, fellas.
Come on, now.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Fred, what'll we do?
You were raised on a farm.
I don't know.
We were kind of funny farmers.
We kept our chickens in the henhouse.
Come on now.
Now, let's see.
Oh, Ethel, we're still missing 67 chicks.
Oh well, where would you go if you were 67 chicks?
Anywhere to get out of this 90-degree heat.
They gotta be around here somewhere.
Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick.
Come on, come on, chickens.
Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick.
Oh, where's Fred?
He's making us some lemonade.
Oh, good for him.
Chick, chick, chick, chick  Chicky-chicky-chicky, chick, chick, chick!
Come on.
Chicky, chicky, chicky!
Oh  Come on out of Come on!
Come on!
All right.
Come and get it!
Cool and refreshing.
There you are.
Oh!
Oh!
I know, I know.
Oh, boy, that just hits the spot!
Oh, I'll say it does.
It's like a steam bath in here.
What's the latest count?
Any suggestions?
Yeah.
Let's wait till they grow up.
They'll be easier to find.
Hello?
Oh, we're in here, honey.
Hey, it's hot in here.
Yeah.
Why, it's over 90.
Don't touch that thermostat!
What's the matter?
What's going on?
What's all this?
Why is the heat up so high?
Why are you dressed up like that?
What questions do you want me to answer: "What's going on?
What's all this"?
"Why is the heat up so high"?
Or "why are we dressed like this"?
Answer them all.
Okay.
Boy, it's hot!
These are baby chicks and the heat's up so high so they won't freeze.
We're dressed like this so we won't roast, and this is all going on 'cause Little Ricky left the door to the den open, and would you care for some lemonade?
Well, I like to think that I got into the wrong house, but I know I didn't.
No, you didn't.
Well, Rick, you see, Lucy and I bought 500 baby chicks.
Yeah.
Aren't they cute, honey?
Adorable, but what are they doing here?
Well, we had to bring them into the house because these two dumb Doras didn't know that you have to keep baby chicks in brooders.
Why, anybody knows that you have to keep baby chicks in a brooder.
What's a brooder?
It's a contraption to keep them warm.
Oh, well, come on.
Let's get them out of here, put them in the den and let's cool off the rest of the house.
We can't.
Why not?
Because, sir, 65 of our chickens are missing Well, I can't stand this heat any longer.
Well, now, Rick, we gotta keep it this hot until we find the missing chicks.
All right, come on, let's find them.
Oh, we've been looking, Ricky.
Pollito, pollito, pollito, aqui, aqui, pollito!
Pollito!
Pollito!
Ricky, in English.
In English.
Oh Chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick!
Chicky!
Boy, it's hot in here.
Hey, there's a bunch of them out here under the clothes dryer!
Well, get them out of there.
Oh, I can't reach them.
They're all huddled up against the wall.
I'll help you.
Chicky, come on.
Chicky!
Come on, chick.
Chick, chick, chick!
Are you getting them?
No, I can't reach them either.
Well, you need any help?
No.
I got an idea.
I think I'll pretend I'm their mother.
Maybe they'll follow me.
Hey, she's getting them.
Over here, honey.
Over here, honey.
That's it.
That's it.
Hi, Betty.
Lucy, these are the people from House and Garden magazine.
I don't think so.
Oh, dear, no.
I'll call you later, Lucy.
Oh, dear!
Now we'll never get our picture in House and Garden.
That's all right, honey.
Don't worry.
Maybe we'll make the next issue of Chicken Breeders' Gazette.
Oh Come on.
Come on.
"I Love Lucy" is a Desilu production.
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz will be back next week at this same time.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
What's the matter?
You are not cooperating.
When you dance the tango you should have a sultry look.
A sultry look?
What do you mean?
Like this.
Well, I don't think we should look that sultry.
Why not?
Look, honey, we're doing this dance for Little Ricky's P.T.A.
We don't want to have the school raided.
You don't have to overdo it.
Just look interested.
You know, breathe heavily or something.
Breathe heavily?
Well, you know.
Oh, not that heavily.
Hi.
Hi, Ethel.
What are you doing?
We're dancing, what do you think?
Oh.
Ricky and I are going to tango for the P.T.A. a week from Saturday.
Oh.
Now, look, honey  What?
Do we have to dance?
Couldn't we just take tickets or sell popcorn or scrape the gum from underneath the chairs after the show or something?
Now, honey, I promised them that we would perform.
I know, but I just don't want to lay an egg, that's all.
Hey, speaking of that, look.
Ethel, you mean our chickens are starting to lay?
Oh, no, not yet, but I thought we ought to be ready to get right down to business the minute that first egg rolls off the assembly line.
You're right.
Listen, it should be any day now.
Fred says that they should start laying when they're six weeks old.
Gee, just think, 500 chickens.
And, if they're conscientious, we'll have 500 eggs a day to sell.
We'll be rich.
Smartest thing we ever did.
Let's see, 500 eggs a day at 60 cents a dozen Let's see Oh, now, don't bother.
Fred's got it figured out to the last penny.
Oh, I'll bet he has.
Say, by the way, where is our vice-president in charge of chickens?
He went over to Corwyn's Hatchery to pick up some egg crates and some more feed.
More feed?
Yep.
Fred says you got to put something into chickens if you want to get something out of them.
Well, he's right.
Honey, let's try the finish again, huh?
All right.
Hey, look at this, see what you think, will you?
All right.
We're going to do a dance.
Okay?
Fine.
Gee, you look just like Vilma Banky and Rudolph Valentino.
Yeah, well It's a little rough yet; needs some practice.
Yeah, a little bit.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Fred, you're back.
Hello, Fred.
How are you?
Did you get the egg crates and the feed?
Well, I got the feed, but no egg crates.
Why not?
Well, I don't know just how to tell you this, Rick.
Tell me what?
Well, you remember, I told you the chickens started to lay when they were six weeks old?
Yeah?
I made a slight miscalculation.
Mr. Corwyn tells me it's six months.
What?
Oh, brother.
No wonder those little chicks looked so wild-eyed when I put them on the nest and said, "Come on, give.
" I thought you were raised on a farm and you knew all about chickens.
So I made one little mistake.
One little mistake, he says.
You know, that one little mistake of yours, puts me in a bad spot.
I was depending on the money from the eggs to help pay the expenses around here.
Yeah, I know, Rick, and I'm sure sorry.
It doesn't make me want to jump for joy, either.
Oh, brother.
Well, listen, partner, this puts a whole new light on our business arrangement.
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, we were going to share the profit from selling the eggs, right?
Right.
In return I was gonna do all the work around here for nothing, right?
Right.
Well, now there won't be any profits.
So until the chickens start laying I think you ought to pay me a salary, right?
Wrong.
How do you figure?
Well, now, look, Fred.
I'm not making any money out of the eggs.
In the meantime, you're living in the guest house for nothing, so until the chickens start laying, I figure you should pay me rent.
Rent?
!
Yeah, you know, that little thing that I used to pay you the first of every month for 16 years?
Now, look Now, wait, you two, don't get into a snit.
Now just maybe we don't have to wait so long to have some profits.
What are you talking about?
Well, why couldn't we trade in those baby chicks for some full-grown hens that would start laying eggs right away?
Yeah, that way you'd have your profits and you'd have your income.
Now we're getting someplace.
I've got to hand it to you, Lucy.
Yeah, honey, that's a good idea.
Yeah, I've done it again.
Again?
Again?
Don't knock it, just be glad I did it this once.
Look, Fred, let's go over to the hatchery, and see what kind of a deal we can make with that fellow.
Right.
Let's go out and say good-bye to our baby chicks.
Oh, yes, that's a great idea.
Isn't that a good idea?
There's nothing like growing your own breakfast, huh, Ethel?
Mm, boy, I'll say, these are so fresh.
Mommy, did our chickens lay these eggs?
Yes, dear.
Our nice, new, big chickens.
Now, what's the matter now?
I tell you what's the matter!
Fred botched it again.
What are you talking about?
You told me that each one of those hens was supposed to lay one egg every day.
Right?
Well, they've been here for a whole week and all we've gotten is six lousy eggs.
What do you expect me to do, squeeze the eggs out of them?
Well, you're the expert, do something.
I've done everything but jump up and sit in the nest with them.
Oh, now, honey, don't get all upset.
Maybe the reason the chickens aren't laying is because they're nervous.
Nervous?
What have they got to be nervous about?
Wouldn't you be nervous if someone was standing around waiting for you to lay an egg?
Yeah, Rick, it's their new surroundings.
As soon as they get to feeling at home, I bet they'll drop eggs so fast we'll have to jump out of the way.
She's right, Rick.
I hope they start feeling at home soon.
Well, anyway, we're getting our breakfast for nothing.
For nothing?
Listen, with the cost of the feed, the money that I spent fixing the henhouse, the extra heat and electricity and the money lost by switching the 500 baby chickens for the 200 hens, I figured out each one of those breakfasts is costing $18 apiece.
Eww.
Yeah, "eww.
" Listen, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to give those hens one more day.
Now, if by tomorrow they don't start laying regularly I'm gonna sell the whole bunch of them and get out of the egg business.
I can take a hint.
Come on, Ethel, let's start packing.
Oh, now, Fred Oh, now, Fred Hold on, you got one more day.
Yeah, now, Fred, instead of packing, maybe you'd better get out there to that chicken house and give those hens a pep talk.
Yeah, why don't you try scaring them?
Walk through the hen house with a sign that says: "Fryers for sale.
" Sure, sure.
Well I'll help him.
Yeah, you go help Uncle Fred, huh?
Chickens.
I should have raised something I knew about, like sugar cane.
Oh, dear.
Oh, Lucy, this is awful.
The boys at each other's throats, the chickens aren't cooperating.
What are we going to do?
I don't know, but don't give up, we got one more day.
You don't expect those hens to lay a bumper crop of eggs overnight?
You know, they could if we helped them.
Lucy, I've never laid an egg in my life and I refuse to start trying now.
No, I don't mean that, I mean buy some, maybe about five dozen.
Take them out to the henhouse, put them in the nest, and let Fred and Ricky discover them.
What good would that do?
It'll only delay the inevitable one more day.
Well, in the meantime maybe our hens will warm up and our men will cool down.
It's worth a try.
Well, so far, so good.
Where's Ricky?
He went into New York.
How about Fred?
He's taking a nap.
How do you know that?
It's after lunch and before dinner.
What else would he be doing?
I guess you're right.
Well, get your eggs and let's get out there.
All righty.
Uh-oh.
What's the matter?
Your sleeping prince, he's out by the henhouse chopping wood.
He's supposed to be taking a nap.
Can't he ever do anything right?
Well, now what will we do?
We'll just have to wait till he finishes chopping wood.
He'll probably be out there all afternoon.
We got to get these in the nest before Ricky comes home.
Well, what'll we do?
We'll just have to stash them on us someplace and just walk casually by Fred.
We can't stash away five dozen eggs.
Well, we can give it a try.
Here, open them up.
What are you going to do?
Well, I'm going to put some in my blouse.
I can get some in my hip pockets, too.
Be careful.
Want me to help you?
No, let's see, now.
Ooh, you have to be awful careful.
Yeah, this  Oh, oh What's the matter?
Whoo, they're cold.
I wonder how the chicken stands it.
Hey, I can get a dozen in one pocket.
Yeah, I'm doing all right, too.
Don't break them, don't break them, be careful.
No, just sounded like it.
Just precious.
We'll make it.
Three dozen?
I haven't broken one yet.
How do I look?
Oh, you look kind of lumpy.
Maybe I better put my jacket on.
Yeah, want me to help you?
I can do it.
I'll help you, honey.
Wait a minute, I got one more egg to go.
Now, how's that?
Oh, that looks fine.
How do I look?
Well, whatever you do don't try to walk like Marilyn Monroe.
Oh, we got to get rid of these cartons.
Put them all in here and I'll put them away there in the firebox.
I'll get it, I'll get it.
Want me to help you?
Easy, now, I can't Lucy.
Hi, honey.
Why, I thought you were in New York.
Well, I decided to take the late train because I want to rehearse our number.
Rehearse?
Oh, the act's just fine, honey.
We don't want to get over-rehearsed.
Well, I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.
Come on, I haven't got much time, it's either now or never.
Well, then make it never?
Look, honey, if we're going to do the dance in front of all those people I want to do it right.
Now come in and rehearse.
Well, I guess you won't be needing me, Lucy.
So long!
Now, Ethel Huh?
Wait a minute.
Stick around, I want you to see- you know, tell us what it looks like.
Come on, come on.
Come on, honey.
What's the matter?
Honey, if we're gonna dance for the P.T.A., we should be dignified.
We should stand at least two feet apart.
To tango?
Yeah, well, you were right.
We don't want to get the school raided.
Come on, honey, if we're going to tango, let's tango, eh?
Lucy!
That's enough, honey Come on, I want to do the finish.
The finish?
Yeah.
Look, Lucy I know that this is a ridiculous question What were you doing with eggs under your shirt?
Trying to hatch them?
Lucy Well, Ethel and I were trying to sneak some eggs out into the henhouse you know, just to give the hens the idea so that you and Fred wouldn't be mad at each other anymore.
Ethel!
Are you carrying eggs?
I was.
I'm sorry, Ethel.
You're sorry.
All right, that does it.
Tomorrow morning I'm gonna sell all the chickens and get out of this chicken business.
Hi, Ricardo.
Hi, Ramsey.
Want to ride bikes?
Uh-uh.
Why not?
I don't feel like it.
What's wrong?
We're going to have to get rid of all our chickens.
How come?
They don't lay enough eggs so my daddy says they got to go.
That's what mine said when our cat had kittens.
Did he give the kittens away?
He couldn't.
How come?
Because I hid the kittens so he couldn't find them.
Hey!
Think we could hide chickens?
How many chickens are there?
Boy, I think this is going to be a little tougher than kittens.
Come on, Bruce, let's get started.
Okay.
Fred?
Yeah?
Well, where are they?
Where are who?
The chickens, that's who.
The poultry man is outside waiting to buy them and they've all disappeared.
Well, don't tell me your troubles.
Now, look, Fred, you're in charge of the chickens.
Now where are they?
I was in charge of the chickens I quit, remember?
As long as you're staying here the chickens are your responsibility.
I'm not staying here, we're moving out.
Who do you mean by we?
Me and my wife, Mrs. Mertz.
You sure that's everybody that's moving out?
What are you driving at?
I'm not driving at anything, Fred.
Just so happens this room is full of chicken feathers.
So what?
Yeah, so what?
So how'd they get here?
Don't ask me.
You know what a miserable housekeeper Ethel is.
What's that, Fred?
How should I know?
Well, it doesn't sound like Perry Como.
My, what a lovely hat.
Well, Fred?
Well, what?
Now, look, Fred, just because there was no profit out of the egg business, there's no reason for you to plan to walk off with 200 chickens.
Just a minute.
Are you calling me a chicken thief?
Those are your words, not mine.
I don't know how this chicken got in here and I don't care, but I defy you to find another one in this house.
You got some friends around here?
All right, Fred.
All right what?
Look, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to go over to the house, I'm gonna wait there for 20 minutes.
Now, if the chickens reappear there will be no questions asked and I will not prosecute.
Just a minute.
Just a chicken-pickin' minute.
Gee, Ethel, I just feel terrible.
Me, too.
You and Fred moving back to the city.
I don't want you to move away.
Well, I guess friends should never go into business together.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I wonder how Sears and Roebuck handled it?
Well, for one thing, Sears wasn't a stubborn Irishman and Roebuck wasn't a hot-tempered Latin.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Well, even though we're not going to be neighbors anymore, you and Fred can come out and visit us on weekends.
Oh, Fred's so mad it'll be years before I can drag him out here again.
Yeah.
Well, we can meet secretly for lunch at Schraft's.
We can do that.
Yeah.
Well, I got to go help Fred with the packing.
Okay.
Dear.
So long.
Oh.
Oh, I almost forgot, my fur jacket's in your closet.
Oh.
Hey.
Why don't you leave it there?
Pretend that you forgot it and you can come out and get it next week.
Oh, that's a wonderful idea, Lucy.
Maybe by that time our gladiators will have cooled off.
Come on, you coward, put up your dukes.
I'll paste you right in the mouth.
I'd like to see you try.
Yeah, well, step outside.
We just came in from outside.
What's going on?
He called me a chicken thief.
That's what's going on.
A chicken thief?
There are 200 chickens missing and I found a bunch of them over at their place.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Fred didn't steal any chickens.
Did you, Fred?
Of course not.
See, Ricky, if he says he didn't take them he didn't take them.
How do you know?
If there's one thing Fred isn't- and there's only one thing Fred isn't- it's a chicken thief.
Thanks, Ethel.
All right, then, Ethel let me ask you a question.
How did a chicken get into your hatbox?
How did a chicken get into my hatbox?
Yeah, how did it get in there, Ethel?
Lucy, are you going to stand there and let him accuse me, too?
Well, how did that chicken get in your hatbox?
That does it.
We're leaving, and I'll just take my fur jacket with me.
I wouldn't want to make another trip out here to pick it up.
Now who's a chicken thief?
You're a pretty cool cookie planting those birds in our place just to throw us off the track.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You were going to call me a chicken thief and get me to leave and then sell all the chickens to the poultry man and collect all the money!
Oh, no, Fred.
He isn't that clever.
But there's someone in this room who is.
Are you calling me a chicken thief?
Those are your words, not mine.
You've got a lot of nerve, you and your hatbox full of chicken feathers.
Yeah, yeah.
I suppose you want me to think those birds walked in to that closet and shut the door behind them.
I have no idea how those birds got into that closet.
I bet he's got them stashed all over the place.
I'll bet they have, too.
How do I know how they got in there?
Oh, isn't that What are you doing in there?
Yeah, you know what he's doing in there.
You put him in there!
I did not!
Hello?
What?
Oh, no.
Thank you.
What is it?
That was Betty Ramsey.
Her little Bruce's room is full of our chickens.
How did they get there?
I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion.
Little Ricky!
What, Mommy?
Have you been hiding our chickens, dear?
Come on, son, tell us the truth.
Will I get a spanking, Daddy?
No, not if you tell me the truth.
Bruce and I hid them.
Why did you and Bruce hide them?
I didn't want you to give them away.
Gee, Fred I'm sorry I called you a chicken thief.
That's all right, Rick.
I've been called worse things by Ethel.
Lucy, can you forgive me?
Can you forgive me?
I guess it'll take more than a bunch of chickens to break our friendship.
Right.
How about the chickens, Daddy, can we keep them?
Well, I don't know if we can keep them or not, son.
You see, Uncle Fred and I went into the egg business together Hey, look what I found in my bedroom.
Our chickens are laying, our chickens are laying eggs.
Well, the Ricardos and the Mertzes are in business together!
Oh, I'll help you unpack!
"I Love Lucy" starring: was brought to you by New Lilt, the only home permanent with squeeze bottle magic.
The fastest, easiest home permanent, ever.
"I Love Lucy" is a Desilu Production.
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz will be back next week at this same time.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hi, honey, I saw you drive in.
Hi.
How was the meeting?
Oh, it was all right.
Did you see Fred and Little Ricky out there playing baseball with the neighborhood kids?
Yeah, I saw them.
Uh-oh, Fred struck out again.
He's so vain, he won't wear his glasses and he can't see the ball without them.
Well, what's new with the Westport Historical Society?
What's the matter, honey?
Oh, Ethel, I've done something awful.
What is it this time?
Now, if you take that tone, I may not tell you.
Good.
Come back here.
I have to tell someone.
Okay.
What is it?
Well, our historical society's having its annual fundraising drive and today we were planning the show and everyone was promising what their husbands would do.
Uh-oh.
Betty Ramsey said that her husband would get the advertising for the program and Gertrude Foote said that her husband would print the programs and Grace Munson said that her husband would take care of the floral decorations and  well Out with it.
Well, everyone was volunteering their husbands and I jumped up and said that Ricky and his band would play for the show.
You volunteered Ricky?
Well, he's the only husband I've got.
Oh, Lucy, how are you going to break this to him?
Oh, I don't know.
This is a tough one.
Gee!
I could try buttering him up; that always works sometimes.
Lucy, there isn't buttering-up in the world that could get Ricky to bring his band out here to Westport to play for a show put on by a historical society.
You forget I'm a pretty good butter-upper.
Let's see now.
When he gets home, I'll have a delicious dinner waiting for him.
I'll put him down on the divan.
I'll give him the evening paper and his slippers.
I'll get him in a very good mood.
How's that sound?
Great, as long as you don't tell him.
Oh, Ethel!
Heavens!
Well, hi, dear.
What's the matter, Ricky?
Oh, nothing!
What's the matter with him, Fred?
Oh, the other kids threw him out of the ball game because he can't play as well as they can.
Aw, the poor little thing.
Yeah, well, these country kids get more time to practice than the city kids, but he'll learn.
Oh, sure he will.
Oh, poor kid.
Now, now, Lucy, let him alone.
There are some things a man has just got to work out for himself.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Well, how'd you do, Babe Ruth?
Oh, they threw me out of the game, too.
You poor little thing.
Good luck with both your Rickys.
Well, hi, darling.
Hi, honey.
Did you have a hard day?
Well How'd everything go at the club?
I'll bet that was a long, tiring ride home on the train, huh, honey?
You just sit down here and don't you worry about a thing, sweetheart.
You just sit, and here's your evening paper and here are your bedroom slippers.
Thank you.
My, I sure missed you today.
My shoes, dear.
Oh.
I sure missed you today, dear.
I wish you didn't have to go into New York every day, sweetheart.
It would be nice if you could stay around here with me all the time.
It would be kind of nice.
Oh, I'd sure love that.
Now, honey, you just sit right up there and you be comfy-cozy, see?
And don't you worry about a thing.
And dinner will be ready in a little while.
And do you know what we're having?
It's one of your favorites.
Smell that?
What does it smell like?
It smells like you want me and the band for that show.
Oh, no, no, no.
We're having chicken and rice and fried bana How'd you find out?
Betty Ramsey just told me.
I forgot Betty Ramsey was gonna drive you home from the station.
Well, that's one of the hazards of living in the suburbs.
Yeah, well.
Well, now that you know all about it, Ricky, will you?
No.
And I spent two hours over a hot stove cooking chicken and rice.
Well, don't worry about that, honey, I'll eat it.
But Ricky, just tell me why.
Because I love chicken and rice.
Oh, I mean, why won't you play for the show?
Look, I'm not gonna transport my whole band to Westport, Connecticut, and besides, you know that we have to play at the club.
Well, maybe you could just give us a few of them, you know, like the piano and the drums and the  whatever you call them.
The claves and the maracas.
Yeah.
No.
Oh.
It's such a worthy cause, honey.
I know, dear, and I'll be very happy to give them some money.
Oh, the money's not important; it's the spirit of the thing.
It's a community project.
And we need your band to play if we want the entertainment good.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry, but I cannot do it, and that's final.
But, uh, thanks for the paper and the slippers and the chicken and rice and the soft soap.
Where's Ricky?
He's up in his room.
Hey, partner!
I think maybe you'd better go up and have a talk with him.
He's a little upset.
Oh, what's the matter?
Well, the kids wouldn't let him play baseball with them today.
They said he wasn't good enough.
Oh, dear.
Well, I'll go up and have a little father-and-son talk with him.
And after dinner, you can have a little husband-and-wife talk with me.
This little husband is through talking.
Now, the issue is closed.
Well, if you won't bring your band, what are we gonna do for music?
Well, you play a pretty mean saxophone.
Maybe some of your friends can play.
Organize your own band.
I promised them Ricky Ricardo.
All right, just go  Maybe they won't notice.
Oh!
Honey, I forgot to bring these eggs over this morning.
Thanks.
Look at the size of that one.
That's nothing compared to the one I just laid with Ricky.
Uh-oh.
What happened to your buttering-up plan?
Well, Betty Ramsey spilled the whole thing before I even got my churn started.
Well, I hate to say I told you so Well, don't, then!
I have to call the historical society and tell them Ricky can't make it.
Oh, honestly, that Betty Ramsey- big blabbermouth.
Hello, is this the Westport Historical Society?
Well, this is Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Yes, I just called to say that Oh.
Oh, really?
Oh, well, that's wonderful.
Yes.
Yes, that Oh, that's wonderful.
Well, I just called to say that Ricky will be delighted to play.
Good-bye.
What'd you say that for?
She said on the strength of Ricky's appearance, tickets are selling like hot cakes.
Oh, dear.
Wait till they hear the bad news.
They'll have to change their name to the Westport Hysterical Society.
Ethel, I promised them Ricky Ricardo and I'm gonna deliver Ricky Ricardo!
Huh?
Junior.
Little Ricky?
Yeah, why not?
They both play drums.
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, Lucy, I gotta hand it to you.
You get caught in a jam and you're able to produce another Ricky Ricardo.
Well, I always believe in having a spare.
So you got a drummer.
Where are you going to get the rest of the band?
I got the rest of the band.
Lucy Ricardo on saxophone, Ethel Mertz on the piano Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Who was that on the 88 again?
The wizard of the ivories, Ethel May Mertz.
Well, maybe so.
Yeah, and I got Just to round out the rest of the quartet, I have Fred Mertz on the violin.
Does he still have his fiddle?
Yeah, but the last time he played, it was three chins ago.
Don't worry.
I'm sure if he practices, he'll play just like he used to.
Oh, well, then, Lucy, whatever you do, don't let him practice.
Now, Ethel, it's gonna be great.
Our little band is gonna burst upon the music world.
We are gonna be the new sound.
Okay, Fred, you stay right there and be our audience.
You tell us what you think.
What are you doing?
I'm limbering up my fingers.
Think what she'd have sounded like unlimbered.
Oh, now, Fred.
Boy, I haven't had this thing out of the case in years.
Ooh, I even forgot to take this off.
How do you like that?
What?
Oh!
Gosh!
You ought to take that out in the backyard and beat it.
Oh, I know.
oh, Fred, Fred!
That cat sounded better when it was alive.
Oh, never mind the wisecracks.
There's something wrong.
Yeah, what is all that?
Confetti.
The last time I played this thing was at a Roosevelt rally.
He means Teddy.
She knows who I mean.
Mommy, can we start now?
Yeah, as soon as we get tuned up, honey.
Give me an "A," Ethel.
An "A"?
Yeah.
Oh, an "A".
Is that a black key or a white one?
Ethel plays by ear.
Oh.
The trouble is, we have to listen by ear.
Lucy, how about a middle "C"?
I know where that one is.
Well, thanks a lot, girl, but I gotta have an "A".
Oh, well, there has to be one on here someplace.
Let's see now.
Is that an "A"?
Oh, thank you, honey!
So you had to go and find the "A".
Let's hear your "A," Jascha.
Sounds more like a "Z".
Oh, is that so?
Oh, come on, you two, let's get started, huh?
Yeah, what are we gonna play?
Well, I only know that one tune "Comin' 'Round The Mountain.
" For heaven's sake, Ethel, don't you know "Sweet Sue"?
No.
Why?
'Cause that's the only tune I know.
I never learned "Sweet Sue.
" Well, you could; you play by ear.
Come on, try "Sweet Sue.
" Well, I'll try it, but don't blame me if it sounds like "Sweet Sue is Comin' 'Round The Mountain.
" Ready, everybody?
Yeah.
A- one, a-two  Hold it, hold it.
Honey, aren't you playing a little too fast?
No, Mommy, you're playing too slow.
Oh, we're playing too slow.
Well, we'll try to speed it up.
Let's try it again now.
A- one, a-two  Honey honey, are you sure you're not playing too fast?
Yes, Mommy, I'm sure.
How would you like to go outside and play and let us practice for a while?
Great!
Thanks.
Thanks, yet.
Come on, we can get it.
Let's try it again.
I can do that "a-one, a-two" thing.
A- one, a-two  Honey, I'm home!
Oh, hi, darling.
Hi, dear.
Aw, gee, you look tired.
I'm bushed.
Dinner ready?
Not yet.
Why don't you stretch out and take a nap?
Good idea.
There you are.
Okay?
Yeah, thanks.
Ricky?
Mm.
We had our first rehearsal today.
Mm-hmm.
Aren't you gonna ask me how it went?
All right.
How'd it go?
Don't ask.
What happened?
Well, naturally, Little Ricky was just wonderful on the drums and I was pretty good on the saxophone if I do say so myself.
But Fred's violin and Ethel's piano- sheesh!
Pretty bad, huh?
Oh, Fred's violin sounds like he's breaking in a new pair of shoes.
And what Ethel does to those ivories is enough to make an elephant want to take back his tusks.
So what do you want me to do?
Well, honey, we're having another rehearsal after dinner tonight, see, and I thought maybe you could tell them in a nice way, you know, what they're doing wrong.
All right, dear, I'll see what I can do.
Will you do that, dear?
Sure.
Well, now you just take a nice nap and I'll let you know when dinner's ready.
Thank you.
Ricky.
Where's Lucy?
She's in the kitchen.
What's the matter?
Oh.
Well, uh Rick, we had our first rehearsal this afternoon, and I want to talk to you about our little group.
All right.
Well, of course, Ricky, Jr., was just wonderful on the drums and I was pretty good on the piano, too, but Lucy and Fred whew-ew!
Pretty bad, huh?
Oh, yeah, it was bad.
Well, maybe they'll get better with practice.
Well, maybe, but you should have heard them.
Lucy playing the saxophone sounds like a wounded moose calling to its mate.
And Fred's violin?
Oh, I make better music when I file my nails.
Rick?
We're gonna have another rehearsal tonight and I thought maybe you might just stick around and-and straighten them out, huh?
All right, I'll see what I can do.
You will?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, bless you, Rick.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Where is?
She's in the kitchen.
I'm in trouble.
What's the matter, Fred?
Rick, could I talk to you as one professional musician to another?
Sure, Fred.
Well, we had that rehearsal this afternoon.
Oh, is that so?
Yeah.
Well, how did it go, Fred?
Little Ricky and I were okay.
But the women  Bad, eh?
The way Ethel hits those piano keys I wouldn't blame them if they hit her back.
And Lucy with that saxophone it's a wonder every hog in Westport didn't answer the call.
Well, now, look, Fred, you're gonna have another rehearsal after dinner, is that right?
Yeah.
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll see if I can tell the girls in a nice way what they're doing wrong.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
See you later.
Right, bye-bye.
Bye.
Daddy?
Oh, hiya, partner.
How are you?
Can I talk to you a minute?
Sure.
What is it?
Our band.
Your band?
Well, how did the rehearsal go?
Eesh!
You mean that Uncle Fred and Aunt Ethel and Mommy are pretty bad, huh?
Boy, I'll say.
Well, maybe they're not as bad as you think.
Oh, yes, they are.
Well, maybe they'll get better with a little practice.
I don't want to play with them anymore.
Don't want to play with them anymore?
Well, now, wait a minute, that's not very nice.
You remember what happened to you yesterday when you were playing baseball with those kids and they didn't want you to play with them anymore?
But I play baseball better than they play music.
That's not the point, though.
You know, when we had our little talk, we agreed that it wasn't nice to be unkind to people, right?
Yes, Daddy.
So we can't just tell them that they don't play well, can we?
No, Daddy.
Now, the thing to do is to teach them to play better.
So, tonight after dinner, you're gonna have a rehearsal and I'll stick around and I'll see what I can do, okay?
Okay, Daddy.
Okay, son.
Dinner, everybody!
Did you have a nice nap, sweetie?
Sheesh!
Look, let's try it one more time from the top.
Okay.
Now, please, everybody, will you try to remember what I told you that you were doing wrong?
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
One more time.
It's a nice simple tune.
It should be bright and happy and relaxed.
Yeah, aha, that's the way it should go, just like that.
Yeah, boy.
Right here, eh?
Right here, huh?
One, two   Hold it, hold it, everyone.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it, everybody.
Before we go any further, there is something that I have to say.
We'll listen to you.
Oh, well, just say it, Rick.
Go ahead and say it.
Go ahead, honey, go ahead.
Well, you know, Little Ricky's fine on the drums.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
But some of the rest of you need a little work.
Yeah, some of us are pretty bad.
Yeah, some of us are.
Yeah, some of us.
Well, to tell you the truth, you know Go ahead, Rick, be frank.
Sure, just speak right out.
Sure, they can take it.
I mean, we can take it.
Well it's it's the situation is, you know that you play fine, you play good, you know.
As a matter of fact, you play too good.
Well, it's that you-you're so far ahead of your time the public is not ready, for your type of music.
Really?
Take my word for it as a musician.
They are not ready.
Oh.
Well, that's too bad because the show is tomorrow night.
Yeah.
What are we gonna do?
Yeah, well, you know, honey, I- I-I-I realize that, you know, it's such an emergency- and boy, is it an emergency- that, uh, well, I thought maybe I can get away from the club for an hour and bring a couple of the boys down and I'll do a calypso number.
A calypso.
That would be wonderful.
From my album, you know.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Well, if you're just gonna bring a couple of the boys, then you'll need some of us, some of us that aren't too bad, you know.
Oh, sure, sure, you will.
No.
You said we were pretty good.
I did, didn't I?
Yeah, I did that, and I meant it.
Meant every word of it.
And, by God, I think that you should be in it!
Oh.
Yes, sir, and I want you in it.
I want you in the band.
Oh, well, good.
Right.
I tell you, right in that rhythm section, that's where you'll be.
The rhythm section?
Yeah.
What do we do?
Oh, well, you, you I'll tell you what.
Little Ricky can play the bongos and Fred can play the quijada and Ethel can play the cencerros and you can play the cuica.
Oh, well, that's wonderful!
What are we gonna play?
The quijada, the cuica and the cencerros.
Oh, is that good?
Good.
Oh, honey, that's the most, the most important part.
The cuica Cuica?
is the most important part of the calyso I play the cuica.
Hey, hey Hey, hey Let us put men and women together To find out which one is smarter Some say men, but I say no The women got the men beat, they should know Samson was the strongest man long ago No one could have beaten him as we all know He clashed with Delilah and before he knew what Samson had the world's very first crew cut.

{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Honey, aren't you gonna eat any breakfast?
Oh, no, I'm too excited to eat.
Excited about what?
About what?
This is my first trip into New York City since we moved to the country, and that was six whole weeks ago.
I'll bet I won't even recognize the old place.
Well, it has changed a little.
They got skyscrapers now.
Oh, you you get to go into town every day while I'm stuck out here in the country.
What do you mean "stuck"?
You're the one who wanted to move to the suburbs so you could get out of the dirty old city.
Oh, I like it out here.
It's just that after six weeks of fresh, clean country air, a woman looks forward to one day of city dirt.
Am I going, Mommy?
No, honey, you're gonna stay overnight with Bruce Ramsey.
Why can't I go?
I like dirt.
He likes dirt.
Well, honey, we're gonna be out so late.
Mommy and Daddy are gonna go to see a show with Uncle Fred and Aunt Ethel.
What show?
It's called The Most Happy Fella.
Can I see it sometime?
Well, you're a little bit too young for theater, partner.
Yeah, you can see it when you grow up, honey.
At the rate they're selling tickets, it'll still be playing.
That's right.
Say, would you do me a favor?
What?
Would you go out to the guest house and tell Uncle Fred that I'm about ready to leave?
Okay, Daddy.
Thank you.
Put your jacket on, honey.
LITTLE  Okay, Mommy.
Fred's going into town when you do, huh?
Yeah.
Today is his day to collect the rent on their apartment.
Oh.
Say, about the tickets now, are you sure you know where they are?
Yes, honey, I'm sure.
I put them in my dresser drawer in my jewel box with my good jewelry six months ago.
All right.
And you won't forget to bring them with you?
Well, I thought I'd throw them in the wastebasket just before I left the house.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
I'm just checking.
And you're sure you got the right date?
Yes, honey, I'm sure I have the right date.
I put a ring around the date on the calendar.
I made a mental note of it.
I entered it my engagement book.
I did everything but hire an elephant and tie a string around its trunk.
Yeah, but are you sure you got the right date?
Oh, honestly, Ricky, just this once, can't you give me credit for doing something right?
All right, now, now, don't get so touchy.
Well, honestly.
Well, you know how you are.
No.
How am I?
Well, to tell you the truth, you're a little Oh, now, come on.
Really!
Okay, okay, I trust you.
Well, thanks a lot.
Listen, don't forget that Fred and I are gonna meet you and Ethel at Meegham's Chop House.
Okay.
Yes, dear.
And be on time.
Yes, dear.
And don't go crazy, shopping in all the stores.
No, dear.
Bye.
Good-bye, dear.
Sheesh!
Ethel, isn't it fun being in town for an evening?
: Ooh-huh.
Would you ladies care to order now?
Well, uh, we're waiting for our husbands, but, uh, we do we have to get to the theater, so maybe we'd better order something that doesn't take too long, huh?
What's ready?
The roast beef's ready.
Well, how's that for you?
Oh, that's fine.
All right, uh, four roast beefs, medium, with, uh, mashed potatoes and lima beans.
Oh, lima beans.
Okay.
Very well.
Oh, Lucy, just think, we're gonna go to the theater tonight.
How about that?
Where are we sitting?
Sixth row, center.
Downstairs.
Let me see the tickets.
I'd just like to hold mine for a while.
Oh, you silly.
I'll put them in my memory book.
Now, Lucy, don't tell me you forgot them.
No, I did not forget them.
Nobody seems to trust me anymore.
Here they are.
There you are- row F, seats 104, 5, What's the matter?
What time is it, Ethel?
It's, uh, 7:40.
Why?
Too late for the matinee, huh?
Matinee?
!
Oh, no!
Oh, Lucy, how could you?
!
Well, I wrote for the best seats on the first available Saturday.
I forgot all about the matinee.
Oh, of all the dumb tricks.
Well, at least I didn't lose them, you'll have to admit that.
Well, bully for you.
Maybe we can get four more seats at the box office.
Oh, you know this show's been sold out for six months.
Gee, it's too bad we didn't have tickets to a stinker.
What am I gonna tell Ricky?
I don't know, but you'd better think fast.
Look, I'm gonna stall.
Stall?
What good would that do?
Well, you know, he hates to get to the theater late, so I'll, I'll take a long time eating my dinner and, and, and then we'll miss the first curtain, see, and then I'll say that oh, I heard that the show was overrated, and I really don't want to go anyway.
Yeah.
And you be sure and say Oh, hi, Ricky.
Hi.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Sorry, I'm late.
My taxi got stuck in the traffic.
Oh.
Where's Fred?
Oh, um, I don't know.
I guess he's still collecting the rent money at the apartment building.
night?
Well, collecting the rent money is the highlight of the month to Fred, and he likes to linger over it.
Well, I guess we'd better order.
We haven't got much time.
Oh, uh, I already ordered, dear, four roast beefs.
Oh, that was a good idea.
Yeah, I, uh, I thought roast beef was a good idea at the time, but now I don't know.
Steak might be nice, or, uh, maybe some broiled chicken.
What do you think about broiled chicken, Ethel?
Oh, uh, uh Well, I like broiled chicken.
'Course, steak sounds very good, too.
Maybe we should have some seafood.
What month is this?
Is there an "r" in it?
Uh What's the matter with you two?
You know we haven't got time to change our order.
Roast beef is fine.
Oh, here's Fred.
Hi, Fred.
Oh, hiya, Fred.
Are they still following me?
Who?
Oh, here we go again.
Every time Fred has more than $10 in his pocket, he imagines the entire underworld is trailing him.
Pipe down, will you, Ethel?
I got $500 cash in this pocket, and two guys followed me from the subway station.
Well, if you're so nervous, why didn't you take a taxi?
I may be nervous, Ethel, but I'm not panicky.
Fred, are you really carrying $500 on you?
Shh!
Do you want to get me bumped off?
Look, Fred, if you're that worried, I'll keep it for you in my wallet.
No, thanks.
I want a safe place.
A place no holdup man would ever think of looking.
Oh, well, then put it in my purse.
Even I wouldn't think of looking there.
Hey, that's a good idea.
His money belt is at the laundry.
Say, Fred, we ordered roast beef for you.
Is that all right?
That's swell.
Thanks.
Okay.
Wanted to save time, you know.
Yeah good.
This is great.
Yeah, looks good.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Good roast beef.
Mmm.
What's the matter, honey, why aren't you eating?
Oh, I'm just waiting for my meat to cool off.
It's not too hot, dear, it's just right.
Well, they say hot food is bad for the stomach.
Who said that?
I just did.
Didn't you recognize my voice?
Come on, come on.
Stop fooling around and eat your food.
We got to go to the theater.
What are you doing?
Will you please tell me what you are doing?
Chewing.
I know that, but we have to get to the theater.
Can you chew any faster?
Well, then go ahead.
Why not?
!
I read somewhere that you should chew your food 25 times before swallowing.
Well, swallow it now and chew it later.
People should chew their food thoroughly like animals do.
Animals don't have to make an 8:30 curtain.
Are you all right, Ethel?
Yes.
Why?
Well, usually by now you've gobbled your dinner and devoured half of mine.
Well, I just decided to eat like the animals do, too.
Just decided?
You've been eating like a horse for I also read where you should peel lima beans to get the most out of them.
Lucy Yes, you see, all the vitamins are under the upper epidermis.
Lucy, what's up?
Nothing's up.
I just think that it's, it's much better to be healthy than to see an old show.
: Aha!
You forgot the tickets!
No, no.
No, I didn't forget the tickets, did I, Ethel?
No, no, she, she didn't forget the tickets.
See?
Here they are.
Then what's the matter?
What's wrong?
Well Oh, no.
Oh, oh, no!
What?
What?
These tickets are for the matinee.
For today's matinee.
Don't tell me that.
Honey, maybe we can get some more tickets at the box office.
How can get some more tickets?
I asked you, "Have you got the tickets?
And you're sure you got the right date"?
You said, "I put them in my jewel box.
Oh, sure " Look, the sign says "Sold Out.
" Let's stop this foolishness and go home.
Oh, now, Fred, it never hurts to try.
We're in luck.
He got 'em!
Cancellations.
Right in front.
This fellow just turned them in.
Oh, honey, that's wonderful.
See, we see the show after all.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute now.
I only got two tickets.
Two?
Well, we were lucky to get these.
These are box seats.
That's all they got.
Only two, huh?
Just two?
I'm afraid so.
Oh.
Well, um, which two of us are gonna get to see the show?
Well, it's my fault that we missed the matinee, so you two go.
No, Lucy.
You've been counting on this for months.
You go.
Oh.
Well, no, I don't deserve to go.
You take the tickets.
Okay, we'll go.
Oh How come you get to go?
I'm the one that's been counting on this for months.
Well, you just said we should go.
Well, I didn't think you'd take me up on it.
Well, the show's starting.
Somebody'd better go.
Well, who?
Well, look, to make it really fair, why don't two of us see the first half of the show, and then the other two will see the last half.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Yeah, okay.
Which two of us will go first?
Why don't you two go first.
Oh, no.
All right, then we'll two, we'll go first.
Oh, no.
All right, then you two girls go first.
Oh, fine.
Yeah, we'll see you here.
All right, all right.
Have a good time.
Oh, it doesn't really matter.
They can fill us in on what happened.
Sure.
I wonder what the story's all about?
Well, I can tell you one thing: The guy is not married.
How you know that?
Look at the title.
Standing on the corner Watching all the girls go by Standing on the corner Underneath the springtime sky MALE  Brother, you can't go to jail for what you're thinking Or for the ooh look in your eye  You're only standing on the corner Watching all the girls, watching all the girls Watching all the girls Go by.
Oh, Ethel, isn't it marvelous?
Oh, that Frank Loesser music is just great.
Too bad we can't see the rest of it.
Sure is.
Hey, maybe we can see the rest of it.
Oh, now, Lucy, we promised the fellas.
No, look, these people didn't show up for the first act.
Well, maybe they're still coming to see the show.
Oh, Ethel, do you know anyone who's missed the whole first act and still wants to see the show?
Sure, Ricky and Fred.
Besides them.
Look, here's what we'll do.
We go out and give the tickets to the fellas, and after they come back into the theater, we'll just stroll back in with the crowd.
Oh, how could we do a thing like that?
We still got our programs in our hands.
Nobody'll stop us.
Just look innocent, you know.
Never mind.
Just stay behind me.
I'll handle it.
I said look innocent.
The boss has treated you pretty good, Joey.
Yeah Hi.
Hi.
How'd you get in here?
We just strolled in with the crowd.
Where you gonna sit?
Right here.
Right here.
Right there?
Sure.
These people didn't show up for the first act, so evidently, they aren't coming.
Honey, you can't sit there.
We didn't pay for those seats.
Oh, why not?
They got all that extra money for the matinee tickets we didn't use.
She's got a point there, Rick.
Now we'll fill you in on the first act.
Yeah, see, this guy here, he isn't married.
What'd I tell you?
He wrote a letter and  MALE  Don't cry Don't cry Come on back in the house And don't cry Come on back in the house And get out from under that old, cold sky Don't weep Come on back in the house, little sheep Come on back Could've come by train, but oh, no, you had to drive.
Okay, okay, I had to drive.
I thought that judge would never let us go.
Look, we've already missed the first act.
You going to talk all the way through the second?
Oh, no.
Shh, shh, shh!
What are you doing?
Shh, shh, shh!
What are you doing?
They took our seats.
I know that, but you can't sit here.
Why not?
Shh!
There's not enough room.
They're sitting four people in two seats!
Go down and tell the manager.
You go.
I'd like to see just two minutes of this show.
I will not Shh, shh, shh!
I'm going to see the manager.
Could you just move over a little?
Just move over : I'm not pushing.
Just move Honey, I'd like some orangeade.
Orangeade?
Yes, I'm thirsty.
Yeah, you're also crafty, but it won't work.
You want an orangeade, go get it yourself.
Oh And when you're down in the lobby, stay there.
Oh, shh!
Stop your grumbling.
Shh!
MALE  Wait a minute, wait a minute You're from big D I can guess By the way you drawl and the way you dress You're from big D My, oh, yes Big D, little A, double L, A-S Where you going?
I'm really thirsty.
I'm going to get some orangeade.
Well, listen, get me some, too, will you?
Yeah, all right.
And take your time.
Oh, all right.
Yes Big D, little A, double-L, A Big D, little A, double L, A-S  Move over, honey.
I beg your pardon.
Oh, sorry, wrong honey.
Here you are, Ethel.
What's this?
Your bag.
I knocked it off the balcony, but thank goodness, I found it in the aisle downstairs right next to a lady's seat.
: Oh.
Lucy!
What?
This isn't my bag.
Where are you going?
Where you going?
Downstairs.
We'll be right back.
Well, don't hurry.
This is most peculiar.
Now, how could a thing like that possibly happen?
Well, it's perfectly obvious.
Somebody hit me on the head with this and then made off with my purse.
There's a purse snatcher somewhere here in this theater.
You know, maybe I'd better call the police.
Well, I think you  Just let us go down the aisle.
We won't make any noise.
There was $500 in her purse.
I'm sorry.
You'll have to see the manager.
There she is!
That's the purse snatcher.
What?
What are you talking about?
That's my purse!
Oh, and that's my purse.
What are you doing with my purse?
Oh, what are you doing with her purse?
Now, wait, wait.
just a minute.
Uh-uh, wait a minute.
I'll take care of these, please, until we find out for sure just what happened.
I told you what happened.
She hit me over the head with that and stole my purse.
Now, not at all.
It was an accident.
I knocked her purse out of the balcony where we were sitting and I went downstairs and I picked up that purse, thinking it was this purse because in a dark theater, that purse looks a lot like this purse.
In fact, right now you can't tell that purse from that purse.
All right, now, let me get this straight.
Now, this is the purse you thought was that purse I thought this purse was this purse.
This is her purse.
This is mine.
All right, ladies, ladies, now, wait just a minute.
Now, please, look, hold everything.
Look, why doesn't everybody just take her own purse?
Yes.
Now, is everybody happy?
Well, I I guess so.
Nothing seems to be missing.
Lucy What?
the money's gone.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
She stole $500 out of my purse!
Oh, don't be ridiculous!
Well, if you didn't take it, where is it?
I have no idea.
Are you sure you had $500 in your purse?
Oh, I'm positive.
Yes.
Maybe she took it out before she threw it over the railing.
Well, really!
How dare you!
She wouldn't do a thing like that!
Would you, Lucy?
Ethel!
I'm sorry, honey, I'm so upset, I-I don't know what I'm saying.
You see, I have a penny-pinching husband who's gonna kill me when he finds out the money's gone.
Well, lady, can you prove you had $500 in your purse?
No.
Her penny-pinching husband can.
Yes, yes.
He's sitting in box A with her husband.
Now just go up Yes.
there and ask him.
Look, would you go up and bring them down here, please?
Mr. Ricardo and Mr. Mertz.
Ask them to come down right away.
Tell them to hurry.
Lucy?
Yes?
Will you tell Fred when he gets here?
What about you?
Oh, I'll be standing right behind you, bobbing and weaving.
All right, Ethel, I'll tell him.
I'll just say, "Fred, we lost your $500.
But I'll say, "Fred, it was your fault for putting the money in Ethel's purse.
" And then I'll say, "Fred, take your hands from around Lucy's neck.
" That's right.
What's the matter, what happened?
Is this a trick to get us out of the seats?
No.
Now, Fred, Fred, something awful has happened.
Uh, I accidentally knocked Ethel's purse out of the box where we were sitting, and it hit that woman on the head.
Now, Fred, we got the purse back all right, but : your $500 is missing.
How's that, Fred?
Oh, dear me.
Oh, he must be delirious.
Fred  Fred, your rent money's gone.
Fred, they lost it.
I just pretended to put the money in the purse to throw the pickpockets off the track.
You don't think I'd trust Ethel with  Oh, dear me!
Oh, Fred  Oh Oh, Fred, how could you do a thing like that?
Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry.
Me, too, me, too, lady.
Well, I guess we were all pretty excited.
Yes.
Oh, dear.
Oh!
Well, I guess we can all go back to our seats and see the rest of the show.
Why don't you go in?
I'm tired of sitting four in two seats.
Oh, come on, honey, it's not so bad.
No, come on, Rick.
Uh, uh, just a moment.
Did you say four in two seats?
Oh, yes, yes.
There was a ticket mix-up, you see, so the four of us are sharing two seats.
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
Oh, that's all right.
We don't mind.
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Now if four people have been watching the show, then you've got to pay for four.
Oh, well, yeah no, no, that's not quite right.
You don't understand.
You see, the four of us didn't watch the show.
No.
Actually, we didn't even see the first half at all.
No, we saw the first half.
Then we came in the second half, Yeah.
and we hardly have seen any part of that when all this happened.
Besides that, you know, we bought four tickets for the matinee, which nobody used at all.
No.
Then I bought two more tonight, so I really bought six tickets altogether.
Yeah.
So, you really owe us for two.
Look, rules are rules.
If four people are watching the show, then four have got to pay.
Ah.
Well, I guess that's I'll get it, Fred.
That's all right.
There.
Oh, thanks.
That'll do it.
Thank you.
Eight tickets already.
Yeah.
Well Well, come on.
Let's go see the rest of the show.
All right, Fred.
Oh, no, the show's over.
Oh, no!

{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
How you doing, Fred?
Well, I got the unit installed over at our house.
Now it's just a matter of connecting this and the one up in little Ricky's room and the intercom's all set.
Fred, are you sure you know what you're doing with all those little wires and things?
Do I know what I'm doing?
I'll have you know I'm the Thomas A. Edison of today.
Hmm-hmm.
Yeah, but do you know what you're doing?
Look, name one time when I ever botched an electrical job.
All right.
How about the time you tried to rewire your kitchen and the whole East Side of New York was dark for 48 hours?
Was it my fault that all that wiring was 20 years old?
I'll bet you can't name another one.
All right.
How about the time you tried to fix our TV set and the picture tube exploded and burned a hole in the rug?
And how about the time you Do you want this thing set up or not?
Yes, Fred, I'd love to have it set up.
I just want to make sure you know what you're doing.
That's all.
I know what I'm doing.
Okay.
All right.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi, Mommy.
What's Uncle Fred doing?
Oh, he's setting up an intercom system.
What's an intercom system?
Well, it's kind of like a telephone.
See, Aunt Ethel has another gadget like that in her place, and she and Mommy can talk to each other.
Is it better than a telephone?
It's cheaper.
Oh, is that good?
Is that good?
I'll have to have a talk with this lad.
What's that one for?
Well, that's for your room, honey, so that we can talk to you when you're upstairs.
All right, this is ready.
Oh, good.
I want to talk to Ethel.
Hi, Ethel!
How are you, girl?
Hello, there.
Uh, Ethel?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What?
When you want to talk to Ethel, just turn that knob.
Oh.
Hello, Ethel!
How are you?
Hi, Ethel!
Testing, one, two, three.
Testing, one two, three.
Hello, Lucy, is that you?
Yeah.
Isn't this exciting?
Yeah.
It's just like a telephone, only we can talk to each other whenever we want to and all we That's the way to turn it off.
That's the best part of it.
Oh, now, Fred.
Hey, Ethel?
Yeah?
You want to do me some You want to go out to the henhouse get a dozen fresh eggs and bring them over right away?
Sure.
Thank you.
Now, when you get through talking, don't forget to turn it off.
Oh, okay.
Ricky, you almost ready for breakfast?
In a few minutes, dear.
I'm getting out of the shower.
Okay.
Where do you want to put the speaker in Little Ricky's room?
Well, on the nightstand, I guess, would be fine.
Okay.
Can I help, Uncle Fred?
Sure, you can help, partner.
Come on.
Can I talk to outer space through this?
Outer space?
: Well, I guess you can.
But they may not answer.
Oh, boy, I'm going to say hello to the moon.
Say hello to the moon?
All right, come on.
We'll try it.
We'll say hello to everybody.
Get up there.
Hi.
Hi, dear.
I'll just put your eggs in the frigidaire.
Oh, don't bother, honey.
I've to take them over to Betty Ramsey's right away.
She's making a cake for the dinner tonight.
What dinner?
Oh, she's having the neighbors over.
Oh, that's wonderful!
Gee, my good dress is at the cleaners, but I think if I called them up, they'd deliver it in time for the dinner party.
Uh, Ethel Huh?
She's just having the Munsons and the Baileys and Ricky and me.
Oh?
Well, you know, it's just the neighbors that live real close.
Oh, just the close ones, huh?
Yeah.
I see.
The Baileys live four miles away and we live four feet away.
Oh, now, honey, there's no reason to feel funny about it.
She just doesn't know you very well.
Well, that's true.
People like the Ramseys don't hobnob much with us chicken pluckers.
Chicken pluckers?
Oh, Ethel, for heaven's sake.
What a thing to say.
Now, look, we're all in the egg business together.
If you're chicken pluckers, we're chicken pluckers.
Then how come us chicken pluckers weren't invited to the dinner party?
Well, she just doesn't know you chicken pluckers I mean, she doesn't know you and Fred as well, that's all.
Now, look, honey, I'm sure when she gets to know you a little better she'll ask you to one of her parties.
I couldn't care less.
I wouldn't go to a party given by that snob if she begged me.
Oh, honey, now, you got Betty all wrong.
Here are the eggs for your friend.
And I hope her cake falls.
Oh, Ethel, for heaven's sake.
Oh  Hi, honey.
Morning, dear.
Oh, I see Fred connected the intercom, huh?
Yeah.
How do you work it?
Like this.
Oh.
He's putting one in Little Ricky's room now.
What's the matter with you?
Oh, Ethel's all upset because they weren't asked to the Ramsey's dinner party tonight.
That's nothing to be upset about.
Well, that's what I told her, but it didn't do any good.
She still feels left out If I didn't know better, I'd think she was jealous of my friendship with Betty Ramsey.
Oh, honey, that's ridiculous.
Well, I don't know.
You know what the trouble is.
It's hard for the Mertzes to meet people out here.
You know, you have your work, I have my PTA Club activities, but the Mertzes don't have any friends in the country.
FRED : We didn't have any friends in the city either.
Now turn off your switch.
Yeah.
Where is he?
He just connected the speaker in Little Ricky's room.
: Oh.
You know, with that thin' around, you gotta be careful what you say.
Yeah, that's right.
Honey, I feel so guilty about the Mertzes.
Well, it's not your fault, dear.
Well, yes, honey, in a way, it is.
You know, they wouldn't be living out here at all if it wasn't for us.
Well, everything will work out all right.
I don't know.
I have never seen Ethel so upset.
She acted like she'd lost her best friend.
Good grief!
I guess she thinks she has.
Oh, now, honey, you're exaggerating.
No, I'm not.
You know, Betty and Ethel have only met once.
I'll bet if they got to know each other, they'd be friends.
Well, why don't you bring them together?
That's a good idea.
I'm gonna have the two of them over here for lunch tomorrow.
Fine.
Then it's all settled.
Hmm.
Now, what'll I serve for lunch?
How about breakfast?
Who ever heard of serving breakfast for lunch?
Oh, your breakfast!
Yeah.
Oh, honey, yes, sir!
Hi, Ethel.
Hello.
What's the big formal occasion inviting me to luncheon?
Well, I thought it'd be fun to have a fancy girl-type luncheon, you know, like we used to have at Schrafts in New York.
Who else is coming?
Lucy, what are you up to?
What do you mean what am I up to?
Now, don't tell me you've invited Betty Ramsey, the Elsa Maxwell of Westport, to lunch, too.
I gotta get the mints.
Now, Lucy Oh, hi, Ethel!
Hello.
Well, where's our hostess?
She's in the kitchen.
Hi, Betty!
Hi, dear.
How are you, dear?
Wonderful.
How's Ralph?
Fine.
He's still on the trip.
Oh, is he really?
I didn't know that.
Listen, lunch is all ready, so why don't we sit down.
Oh, good.
I'm starved.
Sit right here, dear.
Thank you.
Right there, dear.
Oh, it looks wonderful, Lucy.
Good.
Lucy, I must tell you I love that dinner dress you had on last night.
Oh, well, thank you.
It's real old, but it's my favorite, so I just keep on wearing it and wearing it.
Oh, yes, I know.
I do the same thing.
I get a dinner dress I like and I wear it to death, too.
You're the same way, aren't you, dear?
Oh, yes, every night when Fred and I have dinner in front of our TV set, I wear the same old flannel bathrobe.
Oh, she's a funny one.
You know, when you get to know Ethel better, you will find that she's more fun than a barrel of monkeys.
Monkeys that seldom get invited out of their barrel, that is.
There she goes again.
Oh, Lucy, I was so flattered.
Kay Bailey asked me for the recipe for my cake last night.
Did she?
Yes, she did.
I told her the secret were your fresh eggs.
Oh, well, thank you.
You know, we're in the egg business together, so half of those belong to Ethel.
Isn't that right, dear?
Yes, the shells.
That reminds me.
Did you notice my new eggshell-colored cushions?
Yes, I saw them yesterday.
They're just right for that couch.
Oh, I'm glad you like them.
As a matter of fact, your house really looks lovely.
Just lovely.
Thanks to you.
Now that you've got it all fixed up, we'll have to have a housewarming party.
Mm, oh, I would love that!
Oh, yeah, let's see.
We'll have, uh, the Baileys, Bill and June Spear, the Munsons, the Parkers And the Mertzes.
Oh, yes, and the Mertzes.
I'm afraid we can't make it.
Oh, that's a shame.
Now, dear, we haven't even set the date yet.
Oh, but we're booked up months ahead.
There's the, uh, Hired-Hands Convention and, uh, the Poultry Growers Annual Ball and the Baby-Sitters Amalgamated Dear, dear, dear why don't we wait until we set the date.
I'm sure you'll be able to work something out.
Oh, yes, it'd be such fun.
I love parties.
I've loved parties since I was a little girl.
So have I. And so have you, haven't you, dear?
I haven't been to a party since I was a little girl.
Thank you.
I have sufficient.
Speaking of being a little girl, you should hear about the fascinating childhood that Ethel has had.
You know, she was raised on a ranch outside of Albuquerque, and I want to tell you Albuquerque?
Is that where you're from?
Mm-hmm.
For heaven's sake, that's my hometown.
Oh, really?
I was born there.
No kidding?
I was born there, too.
Well, what a wonderful coincidence!
Isn't it a small world?
What was your name before it was Mertz?
Potter?
What was yours?
Foster.
Not the Leslie Fosters?
Leslie's my father.
Well, Will Potter is my father.
Oh, no!
They belonged to the same lodge.
I'm from Jamestown.
Oh, my goodness, it certainly is a small world.
So you're Ethel Potter.
And you were Betty Foster.
I was Lucy McGillicuddy.
Oh, I remember, your family moved away when you were just a little girl.
Yes, that's right.
I was just nine years old.
Just nine years old.
I lived in Jamestown till I was 17.
Why didn't you tell me you were from Albuquerque?
Me?
Why didn't you mention you were from Albuquerque?
Ethel Potter!
Betty Foster!
Lucy.
What?
!
Yes?
Why don't you get Little Ethel Potter and me another cup of coffee?
I tell you.
Oh, I should have known you were from Albuquerque.
You're so warm and friendly.
Uh, Betty, dear, uh, uh, Yes?
I just love the way you did Lucy's house over for her.
Would you mind doing the same thing for me?
Do my house over?
Oh, you know I'd love it.
Where'd you go to school?
Albuquerque Elementary.
So did I. Strawberry shortcake, gooseberry pie V- i-c-t-o-r-y.
Will we win Betty, it's Lucy.
Listen, I thought I'd like to browse around some of the local antique shops today.
Want to go with me?
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Well, maybe some other time, then, dear.
Okay, bye.
What's the matter, can't she go?
No, she's going into New York today.
What do you mean, you want $40 for a lamp?
It's what I said.
We don't have a decent lamp to read by.
Listen, Ethel, if you want to read, you can read by firelight.
If it was good enough for Abraham Lincoln, it's good enough for you.
Oh, don't drag in your boyhood pals, Fred.
Hey, listen, you two, stop your arguing.
I'm on the intercom.
Who's arguing?
This is the way we always talk.
Oh, Fred.
Listen, Ethel, you want to go antiquing with me today?
Oh, I can't.
I'm going into New York with Betty to look at lamps and stuff.
Oh.
But thanks anyway.
Yeah.
What's the matter, honey?
Betty and Ethel are going into New York together.
So what?
So, yesterday they went to New Canaan to visit a mutual friend from Albuquerque.
Yeah.
The day before that, Ethel took Betty to the market with her.
Ever since they had lunch here, they've been thick as thieves.
Well, you wanted them to be friends.
Yeah, I want them to be friends.
So everything is working out fine.
Yeah, everything is working out fine.
What's so hot all of a sudden about being born in Albuquerque?
What?
I could have been born there myself if my family hadn't lived in Jamestown.
Why, Lucy, I think you're jealous.
Jealous?
Ha!
You're acting jealous.
Not in the least.
Look, if a person brings her two best friends together so that they can become friends and those two friends become friends and then they choose to ignore the friend who brought them together in the first place, then those friends are no longer friends of mine.
Why, honey, you don't mean that.
I certainly do, too, and I don't care if I never speak to them again in my life!
What's the matter now?
My two best friends just went by arm in arm.
I still don't believe it.
I did, too.
I talked to the moon last night.
Did they answer?
No, but maybe they will today.
Okay, let's try it.
You know, Ethel, maybe you could use a lamp like we have in our den.
I could bring it over tonight and see what it looks like.
And the next time we go into New York, I could get you one just like it.
Oh, that'd be great!
Would you tell me if you think I should wallpaper the halls?
Sure.
Let's go look at it.
That isn't the moon That's my mommy.
Maybe your mommy's on the moon.
No, she's with your Aunt Ethel.
Got some cookies I'm hungry?
Yeah.
Come on!
Glad you liked the idea of the wallpaper.
But maybe I ought to ask Lucy what she thinks.
After all, she owns this house.
By the way, Ethel, Lucy's been acting so strange lately.
If I didn't know better, I'd think she was jealous of our friendship.
Oh, why should she be jealous?
She's the one who brought us together.
Well, I just can't figure her out.
When you've known Lucy as long as I have, you won't try to figure her out.
Ethel, I have a little housewarming gift for you here.
A housewarming gift!
Why, thanks.
But, uh, since Lucy's been acting so funny, I don't think you ought to tell her I bought it for you.
Okay.
Go, ahead, open it.
What's that, Ethel?
It's a housewarming gift.
But whatever you do, don't tell Lucy.
Oh, all right.
Well, I've got to run now.
Don't forget tonight, Ethel.
Don't worry, Betty, I won't.
Honey, I have been such a fool.
What do you mean, dear?
Oh, you know, I was kind of upset about Betty and Ethel seeing so much of each other, but Do you know what those two little dears been up to?
What?
They're giving us a surprise housewarming party tonight.
They are?
Yeah.
How do you know?
I just heard them on the intercom.
And, you know, they were looking at a housewarming gift for us, and Ethel told Fred not to tell me about it.
You see, honey, and you were jealous.
Jealous?
Oh, What in the world are you talking about?
How could I possibly be jealous of my two very best friends?
: Oh, honey.
Oh, jealous, never, never.
Honey, I-I still say that we're too dressed up.
They'll know that we're expecting them.
Now, honey, if I'm gonna be surprised, I want to be surprised in my best dress.
Won't they be suspicious?
We never dress like this when we spend an evening alone.
Well, how do they know?
They're never with us when we spend an evening alone.
Well, there you got me.
Well, I don't know.
It's after 9:00.
Are you sure the party's tonight?
Of course, dear.
Well, where are they?
Well, they're probably gathering over at the Mertzes, you know, and they all want to come over together.
Oh.
What are you doing?
Oh.
I was practicing looking surprised.
Oh.
I don't want to spoil their fun.
You ought to do it, too.
You ought to try it.
Go ahead.
Try it.
Try what?
Try looking surprised.
Oh, honey, it's a surprise party, not a holdup.
Don't pop your eyes out like that.
I can't help it.
When I'm surprised, my eyes pop out.
Well, not so far, then.
You looked like you just stuck your finger in a light socket.
Come on, let's have a dress rehearsal at the door.
A dress rehearsal?
Yeah.
We're gonna practice looking surprised, see?
I'll go outside and rap, and then when I come in, you look surprised, see?
Okay, let's try it.
This girl.
Surprise!
Honey, that is not a look of surprise.
Yes, it is.
I'll be surprised if my ribs aren't broken.
Oh, now Come on now, you go out.
: Go ahead, honey.
Now you surprise me.
Come in.
Surprise!
I thought I was supposed to surprise you.
Well, honey, I'm sorry.
but, you know, sometimes the guests come in and hide while the people are out and then when they come home, they jump out and surprise them  I'll bet that's why they're not here.
They're waiting for us to got out so that they can come in here and hide.
Hey, you get our coats.
Where are you going?
Just get our coats.
Ethel?
Yeah?
Ethel, dear, we're going into town for about 20 minutes.
Would, uh, you leave the intercom open so you can hear Little Ricky?
Okay.
Okay, dear, remember we'll be back in Okay.
Gee, it's lucky you caught me.
I was just getting ready to go to bed.
Oh?
Oh.
Uh-huh.
: She's waiting for us to go out.
Well, we're home.
Yep, here we are.
So hang up my coat  Well, we're home.
Yep, here we are.
Dee-da dee-da-do It's so nice to be home Want something to eat, dear?
Yes, yes.
Okay.
Let's go in the kitchen, have something to eat.
Okay.
Well, you must have been wrong, honey.
I don't think anybody's giving us a party tonight.
Yes, they are, dear- I heard them on the intercom.
Well, you must have misunderstood, honey.
They wouldn't wait this long if they were gonna give us a party.
Oh, now, they might.
You know, just to throw us off the track.
That Ethel's a sly one, you know.
She just might wait this long so it'd be so late that we'd just You're right, we're not having any party.
You don't have to cry because we're not having a party.
I'm not crying because we're not having a party.
I'm crying because we don't have any friends.
Oh, now, of course, we've got friends.
No, we haven't.
Sure, they're good friends of yours.
Come on, let's go to bed.
I don't want to go to bed!
Fred!
Fred!
Come down here quick!
Hurry up, Fred!
Oh, dear.
What's the matter?
What's going on?
Oh, Fred, I just heard Lucy and Ricky talking on the intercom, and they think we're having a surprise housewarming party for them tonight.
Where'd they get that idea?
Well, I don't know, but we gotta do something.
I don't know what you're gonna do, but I'm going back to bed.
Oh, now, Fred, those poor little things, they're sitting over there, thinking they haven't got a friend in the world.
What time is it?
They haven't.
Fred, now, we've got to do something.
Uh, here.
Wrap that as a gift.
Wrap that as a gift.
I'll call Betty Ramsey and have her round up a lot of the neighbors and we'll give them a party.
Oh, brother, there goes my beauty sleep.
Coming.
Surprise!
Oh, am I surprised.
You think you're surprised!
Happy housewarming!
You didn't have any idea.
Oh, no, I certainly  Oh, honestly Happy housewarming.
Oh, honey!
That's a present to you from me.
Oh, oh, boy Oh, you shouldn't have.
Hey, I gave you one just like that.
Oh, well, now, that's funny.
Well, now we've each got one.
Yeah.
Come on, are we gonna have this party or not?
!
Everybody, make yourselves at home.
I'll get some ice.
Take off your coat, Fred.
Take your coat off, Fred.
Come on, Fred, take your coat off.
Ethel.
Fred!
I thought you told me this was a slumber party.
Here again are Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz for our alternate sponsors.
Listen, honey, tonight I gotta tell the ladies about the new Squiz Cumb Lilt Home Permanent, and I need your help.
Oh, you sure do.
It's the new Squeeze Comb Lilt Home Permanent.
Ah, you don't understand, honey.
Just tell me the name of this thin' here.
That's the Squiz Cumb.
I mean it's a Squeeze Comb.
No, no, no, no, this.
Oh, that's the comb tip.
Thank you.
Now, this cumb tip cumbs the lotion right into your hair out of a squiz bottle.
Remember how we gals used to dip-dab those messy lotions on?
Well, that's out.
With new Lilt, you just squeeze the bottle and it combs itself right in.
It's so simple, even he could do it if he had to.
Yeah, is izzy.
Yeah, it's izzy.
And you'll get the most beautiful, longest-lasting home permanent you've ever had.
Thank you, honey.
Now, ladies, remember this name: Squiz Cumb Lilt.
Squeeze Comb Lilt Home Permanent.

{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Hurry up, Ricky!
You'll be late for work.
Good-bye, honey.
You got five minutes to get to the station.
Bye-bye.
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi.
How's Ricky enjoying his vacation?
Oh vacation!
Honey, could you move down a little?
Where you going to sweep next?
I'm all through.
Good.
Why don't you come over and talk to me, honey?
Talk?
Sure, you don't have to do all that dustin' and swipin' now.
Well, I'm afraid I do, dear.
The house gets pretty dirty if I don't do my "dustin' and swippin'" every day.
Honey?
Yeah.
You missed a spot here.
Right along the edge there, see?
Right along that edge there.
Thanks.
Look, honey, this is your vacation.
Wouldn't you like to be doing something?
No, no, I just want to sit here and relax.
Psst.
Top of the picture there.
Honey, why don't you call up little Freddie Mertz and ask him to come over and play with you?
You know Fred isn't in town for the morning.
Oh.
He's in New York, remember?
Yeah.
Psst.
What is that?
A piece of lint.
You must have missed it with the carpet sweeper.
Thank you very much.
What do you want me to do with it?
Why don't you get yourself a scrapbook and start a lint collection?
Look, honey, why don't you go for a walk or go out to the village or go out and talk to the chickens or something?
No, I don't want to do anything.
This is my vacation.
I just want to sit here and relax.
How comes there's no cigarette in the cigarette box?
Well, I haven't had time to fill them yet this morning, dear.
There's a whole drawerful in the kitchen.
Oh, thank you.
Whew, a whole week with the Cuban Kibitzer.
You say something?
A whole drawerful in the kitchen, dear.
Cigarettes Oh.
loaded with them.
Lucy?
What?
What's the meaning of this?
What's the meaning of this?
Yes.
Well, this is my wedding ring.
It means that we're married.
It means you're my husband, I'm you're wife and we have a child by this union.
I know all of that.
Oh.
What is it doing in the windowsill on top of the kitchen sink?
Well, that's where I put it every morning.
You see, every morning after breakfast I take it off, I put it on the windowsill.
Then I wash the dishes.
Then I come in here, and I do my housework.
I go back into the kitchen, I take it off the windowsill and put it back on my finger.
Mm-hmm.
Well, that's the easiest way in the world to lose your wedding ring.
Well, I've been doing it for 16 years, and I haven't lost it yet.
Why you have to take it off?
Because dishwater is very hard on diamond rings.
When we got married you said you will never take your ring off.
When we got married, you said that dishwater would never touch these lily white hands.
Well, I bought you a pair of rubber gloves, didn't I?
Right.
That's the easiest way to lose a ring is to take it off and leave it someplace.
You forgot you put it there Look, Ricky and then you lose it I don't know if you realize it or not, but ever since you started your vacation you've done nothing but pick on me and criticize.
LITTLE  Daddy let's fly my new kite.
Yeah, go fly a kite.
All right, son.
Come on.
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi.
What are you doing?
Trying to keep Ricky out of my hair.
What do you mean?
Oh, I don't know what I'm gonna do with him home for a whole week.
He's driving me crazy.
Oh, now you know how I feel every week.
I'm going to have to cook up a project to keep him occupied.
A project, huh?
Yeah.
Well, how about that barbecue he and Fred are planning to build out on the patio?
Gee, I don't know.
That sounds like work.
All he wants to do is sit around and relax.
I don't know how I'd get him to build a barbecue.
Why don't you use the method I always use when I want Fred to do something?
What's that?
Well, I start the project myself, and then Fred sees me and he says, "Ethel, that's not the way to do that.
" And then he goes ahead and does it himself.
Ethel, you're getting to be a pretty tricky thinker.
Well, I've been around the old master for so long, I guess some of you has rubbed off on me.
: Well, Ethel, I guess we're ready to build the old barbecue now.
Yeah, we've never built one before, but let's give it a try.
Yeah.
I don't think he heard us.
Make a lot of noise.
Here he comes.
Here he Uh, guess you better put the cement in there, Ethel.
Might as well look like we're starting, anyway.
Oh, okay.
We're probably gonna need a lot more cement, too, don't you think?
Yep.
Got all the cement in there.
Got plenty of bricks though, I think.
Yeah.
We may need What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Oh, we're building the barbecue, dear.
Wait a minute.
Fred and I are gonna do that next month.
Oh, I know, but the weather's so warm, we got kind of anxious to have it built, so Ethel and I thought we'd just go ahead and do it.
Yeah, just because we've never built one before doesn't mean we can't build this one.
No.
Now here's where I thought we'd put it, Ethel.
Right over here.
This seems like the best place, see?
Yeah.
And then I figure that the grill should be up, say, about that high, to keep the smoke out of our eyes.
Now, won't that make it kind of awkward for cooking?
Well, we'll get a little stepladder and stand on that.
Oh, a stepladder, sure.
Wait, a minute.
Where are the blueprints?
Blueprints?
The plans.
Oh, who needs plans?
We'll just create as we go along.
Yeah, we thought we'd just ad-lib this barbecue.
Yeah.
Now, just a minute, girls, just a minute.
It is very obvious that you don't know what you're doing.
I better do this job myself.
Well, Ethel, I guess that's right.
I guess they do know more about it than we do.
Yeah, building a barbecue is man's work.
Yeah.
Well, let us know how you're doing, dear.
Hold on, I'll need some help.
Help?
Yeah, sure, while I'm doing the brickwork you two can be mixing the cement, so pour the water in there and get going.
I'll go get the blueprints.
Well, you pour the water right in there.
That's what he said.
I know what he said.
Doesn't seem to be mixing together very well.
Maybe we're supposed to help it along.
Oh.
Well, all right.
Oh, my ring.
Oh Well, don't just stand there.
Come on.
Oh, Lucy.
Eww.
What are you doing now?
Mixing the cement, like you told us to.
You're not supposed to put your hands in there.
You're supposed to mix it with that hoe over there.
Now he tells us.
Hey.
Hi, Fred!
Hi!
Oh, hi, Fred.
Hi.
What in Sam Hill's going on around here?
Well, we're going to build the barbecue.
I thought we were going to do that next month.
I know, but the weather got so nice, we thought we'd start right away.
Well, then, I'll go and put on my working clothes and come back and help you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Okay, Fred.
All right.
Well, as long as you have Fred to help you, guess you won't be needing us, dear.
No, we'll just go on in the house.
Now, just a minute.
Just a minute.
For a job like that, it's very good to have some helpers.
Uh, you can mix the cement and hand us the brick while we're doing the work.
Now, go on, get going, mix the cement.
And put some more water in there, Ethel.
Lucy, you pile all these bricks over there in a nice little nice pile over there.
All the bricks over there.
Nice and neat.
Keep it moving, Ethel.
Yes, sir.
Hurry up, honey.
Well, Fred, how about it, huh?
Well, if I do say so myself, it looks pretty good.
Pretty good?
Why, it's a work of art.
I hope the gals got dinner ready.
I'm starved.
Yeah, me, too.
Well, we get Ay, mira que tiene cosa, la mujer esta What's wrong, what's wrong?
Oh, Lucy- I never seen anyone as careless as she is.
Look where she left her ring.
Well, that's one problem I'll never have with Ethel.
She's careful, huh?
No, her fingers have gotten so fat she can't get her ring off.
You know what I got a notion to do?
No.
I'm going to hide this ring in my pocket.
Oh?
And let's see how long it takes her to find out that it's missing.
ETHEL AND  Surprise!
Hi!
Surprise.
Hi!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Honey, don't put it there.
That's still wet, dear.
That's still wet.
Don't do that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh : Gosh.
What were you going to do?
Well, we're gonna initiate our new barbecue.
We were going to cook hamburgers.
Oh, well, you'll have to wait till tomorrow.
You see, this needs about 12 hours, at least, before it sets.
Oh Oh  Gotta dry.
Well, honey, save it for tomorrow.
Well, okay.
We can cook them tomorrow.
We'll make something else tonight, then, hon.
All right.
I'll go home and clean up.
Wait a minute, Fred.
Lucy?
Hmm?
Uh be sure that when you're ready to give Fred a ring.
Yeah, Lucy, give me a ring.
What are you talking about?
I'll call you on the intercom.
Why should I give you a ring?
We have an intercom now.
Why?
Lucy, you can cook macaroni and cheese for me anytime.
Oh, thanks, Ethel.
I'll wash, you dry.
No, I'll wash, you dry.
Okay.
What's the matter?
Oh, no.
What's the matter, Lucy?
My ring is missing.
I've lost my ring.
Oh, now, Lucy, are you sure?
Yes.
Oh, and it couldn't have happened at a worse time.
This morning Ricky found my ring just lying here, and he just about hit the ceiling.
Oh, well, now think, girl.
When do you remember wearing it last?
Let's see now after Ricky gave it back to me, I put it on my finger and I left it on until I took it off to mix the cement.
I remember.
I saw you put it on the bench.
It must be still on there.
I left it right here.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
It isn't here.
No, it isn't.
Maybe it fell through the slats.
Oh, Ethel, I don't see it.
Maybe it fell in one of those pails of water.
And we used that water to mix the cement.
Oh, Ethel.
My wedding ring is someplace in this barbecue.
What are you going to do?
What else can we do?
Now, Lucy, I'm not going to start taking this whole barbecue apart.
Neither one of us are, right now.
We're gonna have to wait until the boys are asleep.
No, Lucy, I'm just not going to do it.
I won't do it!
Now, Ethel, I'd do it for you if you'd lost your wedding ring.
If I lost my wedding ring we wouldn't have to find it, we'd just have to buy another box of Cracker Jack.
Ethel, it's my wedding ring, the one that I've had for 16 years.
The one that Ricky slipped on my finger when we promised to love, honor and obey.
When the minister said, "Do you take this woman to be your la"?
Look, before you start singing "O, Promise Me," I'll help you.
Oh, thanks, Ethel.
Thanks.
I just got to find that ring.
Well Now look, after Fred gets to sleep, you meet me out here, see?
Okay.
You know, it's times like these I wished I'd have kept a diary.
Why?
Just so I could write, "Dear Diary, "tonight I went out in the backyard in my nightgown and felt wet cement.
" Oh, now, Ethel Oh, Lucy, that's the last of it.
Where can your ring be?
: I don't know Now, honey, it'll turn up someplace.
Oh, gee, it's 2:30.
I got to get some sleep.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I'm beat, too.
What are you doing?
I'm putting the barbecue back together again.
Lucy, that'll take you all night.
Listen, I'm going to be in enough trouble when Ricky finds out I lost my wedding ring.
I'd hate to think what he'd do if he sees this.
I could have been in a nice, quiet apartment in New York.
No, I had to move to Connecticut so I could be near you.
I don't blame you for the way you feel, Ethel.
You go on to bed, I'll do this.
Good night.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
Oh, gee, Ethel, thanks.
It's times like this when you know what friends are for.
If I'd known this is what friends are for, I'd have signed up as an enemy.
Morning!
Oh, hi, honey.
Hi!
Where's Ricky?
Oh, he's out flying his kite.
How do you want your eggs?
Oh, hold it for a minute.
I want to go out and see the barbecue.
Oh, you don't want to look at the barbecue.
: Why not?
Well, uh, you-you shouldn't look at a barbecue on an empty stomach.
Hey, that's very funny.
I'll be back in a minute.
Lucy, everybody, hurry!
Come out here and look!
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
What happened?
Oh, my goodness, how terrible!
Oh, isn't that awful?
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Never mind about your relatives!
How did this thing happen?
How should I know?
That's not the barbecue we built!
Of course it isn't!
This is a monstrosity!
I'll say!
I've seen better things built by a beaver with his tail in a sling.
I- It looks like-like somebody took it apart and-and put it back together again.
Yes.
Oh, for heaven's sake, who would do a thing like that?
Well, what else could have happened?
Well, any one of a number of things.
Like what?
Well like maybe an earthquake an earthquake last night.
Yeah, that's it.
They don't have earthquakes here in Connecticut!
That's not it!
It looks like it was hit by a tornado.
A tornado, that's it, hit by a big fat tornado.
They don't have tornadoes in Connecticut, either.
Oh, boy, this is a dull state.
I tell you what I think it was.
ETHEL AND  What?
A couple of hurricanes.
Hurricanes!
Oh, hurricanes.
Yeah, Hurricane Lucy and Hurricane Ethel!
Whatever makes you think a thing like that?
I don't know.
But it just so happens that anytime something goes wrong around here, I got a pretty good idea where to start looking.
Well, could we help it if the cement wasn't?
Aha!
Aha!
The cement was what?
What did you say?
I didn't say anything, did I, Ethel?
Uh, no, no, no.
I didn't I didn't hear her say a-anything.
Daddy, Daddy!
Just-just-just a minute, partner.
We're about to hear a very interesting story from your mother.
But Daddy In a minute, amigo.
All right, Lucy, let's hear it.
I'd rather hear from little amigo.
Lucy!
Well, all right.
We took the barbecue apart and put it back together again.
But why?
Why?
Don't hold back the sordid details.
Because I lost my wedding ring, and we thought it was in the cement, but it wasn't.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Ethel!
Were you really in on the shenanigans?
Yes, I was in on the shenanigans, and I'm dead tired from being up all night lifting those heavy bricks.
And if you say one more word to me, Fred Mertz, I'm going to take you apart and put you back together again.
I just asked, honeybunch.
Ricky, go ahead and get mad or something and get it over with.
I'm not mad.
You're not?
No, I'm not mad at all.
This is all my fault.
Your fault?
Yeah I found your ring on the bench here yesterday when we were building the barbecue, so I hid it in my shirt pocket.
But why, honey?
To teach you a lesson.
I wanted to find out how long it would take you before you realized it was missing.
Oh, dear.
I'll go and get it.
It's in the shirt I was wearing yesterday.
Oh, honey that shirt was all covered with cement.
I gave it to Ethel to use as a rag.
Oh, and I gave it to Fred to use on the lawnmower.
Oh, for corn's sake.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
I tore it to pieces to make the tail for Little Ricky's kite.
Oh, well, where's your kite?
That's what I been trying to tell you.
It flew away.
It flew away?
Which way?
Which way?
Where?
!
That way!
The barbecue may look kind of funny, but it makes awful good hamburgers, huh?
Yeah, I'm still going to rebuild it.
I'll cut it up for you.
It sure is an eyesore.
Here you are, honey.
Mmm-mm!
Mmm good.
FRED : There you are.
Honey?
Come on, eat your hamburger.
No, thanks, I'm not hungry.
Oh, you better have one, honey.
They're awful good.
How can I eat when my wedding ring is flying somewhere over Long Island Sound?
Oh, honey I told you I'll buy you a new one.
I don't want a new one.
I want the same one.
I feel so terrible about this.
I'll tell you what.
Look, I'll buy you a new one with-with big diamonds all around it.
I don't want one with big diamonds all around it.
I want mine with the little diamonds halfway around it.
Oh, honey.
I'm sorry.
Come on, honey.
Come on.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.
Lucy, it's great.
I don't want it.
Come on.
Oh, it tastes so good It's good, really.
Mm-mmm!
Good, huh?
Mmm!
Mmm!
Hmm, boy  What?
What's that?
What?
!
Her ring!
I found my ring!
Your ring!
Where'd you find it?
: In the hamburger.
In the hamburger?
!
In the hamburger!
How did it get there?
I don't know!
Oh Hey, wait a minute.
What?
I think I know.
You know, you know, yesterday when you brought that tray  Yeah.
with the hamburgers and everything?
Oh, yeah?
A- And I pi-pick bend down to-to give it back to you?
Yeah?
Yeah?
It must have fallen out of my shirt in the meat.
Oh, Lucy, oh!
Oh, boy!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
What's the matter?
I want to slip it on your finger, like I did 16 years ago.
Oh honey  There you are Aw, isn't that romantic?
Yeah, just like it was 16 years ago, only then my ring didn't have mustard and relish all over it.
Oh Oh!

{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
You mean he took you to see the Dodgers at Ebbets Field?
Well, wasn't that nice of Mr. Appleby?
Uh-huh and tomorrow he's taking us to the zoo.
Well, that sounds like fun.
Well, good night, sweetheart.
Sleep well and I'll see you Monday.
Want to say good night to Daddy?
Here.
Good night, partner.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night, son.
Good night, dear.
Good night.
Oh, good thing I called him early.
He was in his nighty-nights, all ready to go to bed.
I wish I was in my nighty- nights, all ready to go to bed.
Now, Ricky, don't start that again.
Well, it's just that I'd rather be going to bed than to some boring country club dance.
Oh, grumble, grumble, grumble.
Why shouldn't I grumble?
Every night of my life I wear a tuxedo.
I take a weekend off, and what do I do?
I'm wearing a tuxedo.
Honey, I think you should always wear a tuxedo.
You look very distinguished in it.
I look even more distinguished in my nighty-nights.
Aw, now.
The Ramseys asked us to be their guests, we accepted, we're going, and that's all there is to it.
All right, honey, all right.
Anyway, honey, it sounds like fun.
The Mertzes are going and Harry and Grace Munson are going.
Oh, yes, they're bringing along a houseguest of theirs, too.
Who is their houseguest?
Oh, I don't know, some cousin of Grace's- Diana somebody or other.
Oh, great.
There's another one I'll have to dance with.
Oh, now, honey, will you stop?
Are you ready?
Oh, Ethel, you've got a new dress!
Isn't it darling?
Oh, it's just beautiful.
I'm just crazy about it.
Wonderful with your eyes.
I love it.
And doesn't Freddy look cute in his tux?
Adorable.
Oh, I'm adorable, all right.
I'm choking to death, my shoes pinch and I reek to high heaven of mothballs.
Oh, Fred.
Come in, come in.
Door's open!
Oh, look at that girl, will you?
Oh, Betty, you look beautiful!
Is that a new dress?
Won't we have fun?
Come on, let's go, let's go, huh?
Yeah, come on, honey, let's go.
All right, listen, take our car; it's in the garage.
All right, we'll take our car.
Yeah.
Isn't that a beautiful dress on her?
We're going dancing  Hey, uh, look, fellas, I want to apologize for this.
It was all Betty's idea.
You mean you hate the thought of getting into a tuxedo and going to this dance as much as we do?
Sheesh!
The only reason I belong to the country club is so I can play golf.
It's the little woman's idea dragging me to these affairs.
If we'd known how you felt, man, we could have banded together and refused to go.
Yeah.
Do you think it's too late to try?
I'm afraid so, Fred, I'm afraid so.
The Munsons and their houseguest are expecting us.
Ricky, come on, dear!
Ralph!
We're waiting!
Fred!
Yeah, it's too late.
Yeah.
: Coming, honeybunch!
Fred, are we gonna dance again?
Again!
We've already danced once.
What's wrong with twice?
My feet are still throbbing from once.
Oh, Fred.
Oh, stop yawning, Ricky.
I'm sorry, honey, it's past my bedtime.
Well, try to stay awake.
I am- if I wasn't trying, I'd be asleep.
Oh Ralph, why don't you ask the orchestra to play a Charleston?
A Charleston!
I haven't that much energy.
Well, honestly.
Well, look, if we're just gonna sit here like bumps on a log, we might as well go home.
Good, let's go home.
Second the motion.
It's been moved and seconded, we all go home.
All those in favor say "aye.
" Aye.
Aye.
The ayes have it, motion carried, let's go.
Oh, Ricky!
Honey, you heard it.
There were three "ayes.
" Well, there are gonna be three black eyes unless you all sit down.
Fred, come on, now.
Besides, it's early.
Early!
It's 11:30.
It would be rude to leave before the Munsons even get here.
All right, I'll give them ten more minutes.
And listen, when they do get here, be sure you ask Grace's cousin to dance, do you hear?
Oh, no, honey, not me.
Ralph Nothing doing.
Don't look at me, Ethel.
Just because you don't want to dance with us is no reason you should be rude to Grace's cousin.
It's not that we don't want to dance with you, honey Oh, for heaven's sake, honey Hi, folks!
Something happen?
You get tied up in traffic?
Oh, it's always something like that.
Listen, where is your houseguest?
She'll be right along.
Oh, here we are, Diana.
Hi!
I'd like you to meet Grace's cousin, Diana Jordan.
This is Mr. and Mrs. Ralph Ramsey.
And how do you do?
Hello.
And, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Ricky Ricardo.
Hello.
How do you do?
And I'm Freddy Mertz.
Well, hello.
Well, hello!
I'm Mrs. Mertz.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, Miss, uh Diana.
Oh, Diana, won't you sit down?
Oh, but yes.
It's all right, fellows, I've got it.
Thank you.
Yeah!
Well, did we miss anything?
Have you been having fun?
Oh, we've been having a lovely time.
Yeah, it's been great.
Yes, it's been a lot of fun, but we were just leaving because the boys are so tired.
Who's tired?
Who's leaving?
But it's late.
Honey, it's only 11:30.
Yes, the night's young.
We just got here.
Would you care to dance?
Oh!
But yes.
Well, good.
Oh, no, wait a minute.
My mother told me to pick you!
Oh.
Your country club is simply fabulous.
Oh, thank you.
The music's so dreamy.
Do you like to dance?
Oh, but yes,  I adore it.
Oh, well, isn't that nice.
Let's cut in.
By all means.
Well, I see your husband's suddenly recovered from his sleeping sickness.
I see your husband's foot condition finally cleared up.
Isn't this a disgusting spectacle?
Now what are we supposed to do?
Well, maybe we should dance with each other.
: My mother told me to pick you!
Dancing is fun.
We should do it more often.
I was just trying not to be rude.
Fred is trying not to be rude, too.
He's out there now not being rude.
And Ralph is waiting his turn not to be rude next.
What a night.
Diana Jordan sheesh!
And they didn't want to be rude to her.
Do you know Ralph danced with that girl eight times?
Ricky danced with her nine times.
How about Fred?
Twinkletoes.
What an exhibition.
You'd think they'd never seen a blonde before.
They still haven't.
If she's a blonde, I'm a redhead.
How about the boys taking up a collection so they could keep the orchestra there for an extra hour?
Well, how about Fred, of all people, starting it off with a ten-dollar bill?
And did you see the way they leaped at the invitation to the party tonight the Munsons are giving in Diana's honor?
Well, I'll tell you one thing: I'm not gonna sit around like a bump on a log again tonight.
As one bump to another, just how do we avoid it?
If our husbands want glamour, let's be glamorous like Diana.
Oh, isn't there an easier way?
Ethel, it's simple.
Glamour today is nothing but a tight skirt, loose hips and wet lips.
Well, Lucy, that might be all right for you, dear, but I'm just not the glamorous type.
If I could look like Diana, do you think I'd have married Fred?
Oh, come on now, there must be some way for you two to glamour it up.
Say, I do have some very exotic perfume I've been saving.
This may be just the occasion to use it.
Good.
What about you, Ethel?
Oh, I don't know.
Why don't you try your glamorous hairdo, the one that makes you look like Grace Kelly?
You think it'd work?
It worked for Grace Kelly.
Good.
That might be just the thing.
Sure, there's no reason why wives can't be just as glamorous as other women.
After all, we were women once ourselves.
Well our wives are still over at my house huddled around the dining room table.
Boy, we're really in the doghouse.
Yup.
I sure would give a lot to hear what they're saying.
I wouldn't.
Betty gave me the silent treatment.
Lucky you.
Hmm.
Did she really lock you out of the house?
I had to sleep in the rumpus room.
That's what we call it because every time we have a rumpus, that's where I sleep.
I've never seen Lucy so mad- they way she stormed and ranted and raved.
She acted like me!
Boy, they're really sore.
Well, it was worth it.
That Diana is a cute dish.
Ooh, wasn't she, though?
Wasn't she, though?
And do you know that I think she kind of went for me?
Must be the Yul Brynner influence.
Now, listen, you characters.
We weren't very nice to our wives last night.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
We acted like a bunch of schoolboys.
Well, when I was a schoolboy, there were no schoolgirls like Diana.
Well, I think that tonight we should be nice to the girls.
We're going to dance every dance with our own wives tonight.
Every dance?
Every dance.
With our own wives?
Yes, with our own wives.
Well, Ralph?
Well, yeah, I I guess you're right, Rick.
How about it, Yul Brynner?
Well, okay, but for corns' sake, don't let this get to be a habit.
Honey!
Hurry up, it's time to go.
In a minute, dear.
All right.
Hi, Rick.
Well, hi, fellas.
Where are the girls?
Oh, Betty's still primping.
Yeah, and so is Ethel.
She usually takes an hour to dress.
Today she's taking over 2?
hours.
Well, Betty was spraying so much perfume on herself that I had to get out of the house.
Sheesh!
One more squirt from that atomizer and I'd have been overcome by the fumes.
You think you've got a problem!
Ethel's got her hair all skinned back like a wet Pekinese.
Don't you guys see what the girls are trying to do?
No.
They're trying to glamorize themselves to outshine Diana.
Ralph: You really think so?
Sure.
Lucy's been locked up in our room all day long getting ready.
I even had to get dressed in the guest room.
Oh-ho-ho, so that's what they're up to.
Oh, brother, if Ethel's trying to be glamorous, she won't be ready for a week.
Now, look, Fred, don't forget what we promised.
We are going to be nice to the girls.
Besides, what they're doing I think is kind of cute.
Cute!
Wait till you get a look at Ethel.
Wait till you get a whiff of Betty.
No matter what they do, we're gonna go right along with them.
Okay, you're the boss.
Hello.
Well, pardon me, beautiful, you have the wrong house.
Freddy, it's me.
Who?
Ethel!
You didn't know me?
I didn't know you!
Oh, you're a real stunner, you little Dickens.
Oh, thank you, Fred.
Uh, somebody smells awful good.
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, that's that new perfume that Betty's wearing.
Brings out the beast in a man.
Oh!
Hi!
Hello.
What's the matter, dear?
Uh That that dress.
Do you like it?
Oh, I think it's lovely and so are you.
Thank you.
: Oh, Ethel, your hairdo is simply fabulous.
Thank you.
Charming.
Lucy, do you like my perfume?
Oh, I think it's dreamy.
But yes, I love it.
Uh, shouldn't we go?
Yes, let's go.
Honey don't you think that the dress is just a little bit too tight?
Oh, but no.
Everyone's wearing them like this.
Yeah, I know, but are you gonna be able to sit down?
Oh, of course, but yes, I can sit down.
Well, it's a dance, so who'll be sitting?
Well, honey, you're gonna have to sit down in the car to get to the dance.
Well, we'll put the top down and I can stand up all the way.
Oh, Lucy, that'd be fun!
Yes, by all means, put the top down, Rick.
Put the top down all right.
Let's go.
Yeah, well, wait a minute, girls, look, listen- you wait right here, I'll go get the car and bring it to the front.
Yeah, honeybunch, don't you walk any more than you have to.
Save those gorgeous legs for the dance.
Come on, Fred.
I'm coming.
We'll be right back, girls.
Gorgeous legs!
Oh, Lucy, you were absolutely right!
A little glamour really works.
Yeah usually I have to wait in the cold while he backs the car out so I can close the garage doors.
Oh, thank you, Freddy.
Thank you.
Hey, can I get you a plate from the buffet, dear?
Thank you, dear.
Lover?
Well, I've already had one plate.
Oh, have another- I like my women chubby.
How about you, honey?
Oh, I'd adore something to eat.
Lucy, you must be getting awful tired of standing up.
Oh, it's not too bad, I'm getting to be a good leaner.
I can't get over the way the boys are acting.
It's too good to be true.
Yeah, isn't it?
Fred hasn't been this nice to me since he thought my aunt left me $500.
Well, I'm going to start buying this perfume by the barrel.
There's just one thing: Do you realize that the boys haven't even looked at Diana tonight?
Sure they haven't.
It's because we're so devastating.
Yeah, well, we're pretty devastating all right- for us.
But why are they ignoring her the way they are?
It seems very strange.
I think there's more to this than meets the eye.
Oh, listen, Lucy, I don't care why Fred's acting the way he is.
I'm just gonna relax and enjoy it.
Glammy pie, this is for you.
Oh, Fred!
Uh, couldn't we dance now and eat later?
Well, I was in hopes you'd ask me, snookums.
Oh!
And shall we dance or would you rather eat this one out?
Oh, we can always eat.
All righty.
How about you, honey?
Would you like to dance?
No, I think I'd rather eat.
Oh, all right.
Oh.
You know, I've never eaten standing up before.
It's kind of fun at that.
Probably good for the digestion.
Food goes straight down- doesn't have to make any turns or nothing.
You having a good time, honey?
Uh-huh.
Ricky!
Oh, hello.
You haven't danced with me all evening.
How come?
Well, I've been dancing with my wife.
What's the matter with Ralph and Freddy?
They've been dancing with their wives, too.
What's this world coming to?
Yeah, well.
You're certainly acting a lot different tonight than you did last night.
I am?
Yes, and I'd like to know why.
Ricky Ricardo, you're up to something.
No, I'm not up to nothing.
How come you haven't danced with Diana tonight?
I just don't feel like dancing with Diana.
I want to dance with you.
You felt like dancing with her last night.
Oh, honey, well, last night I was just trying to do what you told me.
I was just trying to be polite.
Oh, you were just trying to be polite.
Look, why don't you just confess?
Confess what?
You're up to something; you're being much too sweet.
What's wrong with being sweet?
When you're this sweet, there's something rotten in Cuba!
Wait a minute, I don't know what I'm gonna do with you.
If I don't pay attention to you, you get mad, and if I pay attention to you, you get mad.
What am I supposed to do?
I know that you're just dying to get out there and dance with Diana, so why don't you go ahead and dance with her?
!
All right, I will.
All right.
All right!
All right!
All right!
Okay!
Ethel, come on, we're getting out of here.
What do you mean?
And tell that beast to take his hands off you.
Beast?
I just found out why the boys are being so nice to us.
They're cooking up a scheme with that blonde.
What are you talking about?
See?
Whenever husbands have anything to hide, they say, "What are you talking about"?
Well, what are you talking about?
See?
Freddy why are you being so nice to me?
Because husbands should be nice to their wives.
Oh, that's the worst excuse I ever heard in my life.
All right, let's go.
Yeah, you get Betty, I'll get the car.
I will.
Oh!
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Pardon me.
Any sign of them yet?
No.
Well, they should be here by now.
It's almost 1:30.
Maybe Fred took up another collection for the band.
I must have been crazy to let you talk me into leaving that party.
Me, too.
Frankly, I was having a wonderful time.
So was I. It was the best evening I ever spent with Fred.
He was Well, he was almost human.
Yeah, well, the whole thing was a plot.
Lucy, just what was this plot?
Yeah, you've never been very clear on that.
Well, don't you worry, it was a plot all right.
The three of them and Diana were were Well, they were Well, they were.
Were what?
Oh, I don't know, but at least we'll teach the boys a lesson.
Oh, sure, they're out dancing half the night with that blonde and we're all here brooding and we're teaching them a lesson?
Well, this has gone far enough.
I'm going back to the club, apologize to Ralph for running out and bringing him home.
And I'm going with you.
Let's go.
Well, now, isn't this a pretty sight?
Two cringing wives, crawling on their knees, begging their husbands' forgiveness.
Coming with us, Lucy?
Yes.
Well, how about it, Rick?
Can we go home now?
Yeah, it's ten minutes to 2:00.
Look, we said we were gonna stay here until 2:00.
Then we'll go home.
But it seems like we've been sitting here for hours.
We have.
The party broke up at 11:00.
The way that our wives run out of us we agreed that we were gonna stay here until 2:00 and then go home.
That way, they'll think that we've been dancing with lovely Diana all this time.
Please don't mention dancing in front of my feet.
Has the swelling gone down?
No, they're so puffed up; I'll have to wear Ethel's shoes.
Yeah, well, you were lucky.
You only danced with her.
I tried to talk to her once.
You know, it's amazing how little I have in common with a 20-year-old.
Who's Pat Boone?
At least you talked to her in English.
I had to spend a half an hour trying to understand her high-school Spanish.
"Bonos dyas, senior.
"  Look let's either go home or get me more hot water.
All right, Fred, I guess we can go home now.
Don't forget, let's stick to our story.
Okay, okay.
Oh, here you are!
At 2:00 in the morning!
Where is she, the little hussy?
I'll scratch her eyes out!
Oh, well, you just missed her.
Boy, can that girl dance.
Dance!
You should see the way she intermissions.
I think it's high time that you three gigolos came home with your wives.
Come on, Fred, get your feet out of that bucket.
Let's go.
All right, all right.
Where are your socks?
In my shoes.
Well, pick 'em up, and we're going home.
All right, all right.
Honest to goodness, carrying on Easy now, easy!

Fred, cut that out.
Fred, you get out of my tulip bed.
The idea!
What's the matter, Mommy?
Oh, Fred's trying to bury his bone in my tulip bed.
Oh, that's naughty, Fred.
Yes, that's naughty, Fred.
Especially when Mama's trying to win a prize.
A prize?
Yeah, the garden club's gonna give a prize for the best-looking garden tomorrow, and Mama wants to win the prize.
Hear that, Fred?
Yeah, you hear that, Fred?
Now, you just take your old bone and skedaddle.
Here, you take it, honey, and call him.
Come on, Fred.
Go on, go on, Fred.
Come on, Fred.
Go on.
Come on, Fred.
You go on.
Come on, Fred.
Call him.
Come on, Fred.
Go and get him, honey.
Don't let him run in the street.
Fred!
Ricky, come back, honey!
Here, now, you carry him, dear.
Take him way outside there, now.
Now, you stay out of here, Fred.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Oh how do you think my tulips look?
Oh, they're just beautiful.
Do you think I can win a prize?
Well, I don't know, Lucy.
I was just next door at Betty Ramsey's, and her tulips are beautiful, too.
In fact, her whole garden's just gorgeous.
She really has a green thumb.
If I win that prize tomorrow, she'll be green all over.
Gee, I never saw you work so hard.
Oh, this isn't work- it's fun.
You know, you ought to have a garden, Ethel.
Then you could have fresh flowers all the time.
Oh, who has to work so hard?
I just went down to the village gift shop and bought some wax tulips, and you can't tell the difference.
Wax tulips!
Oh, Ethel!
How can you live with a substitute when you could have the real thing?
I don't know.
I've been asking myself that ever since I married Fred.
You know, I-I think I really do have a chance to win that prize tomorrow.
I hope so, honey, but remember, now, Betty's won the cup three years in a row.
That's before I moved to Westport.
Gee, I'd get a big kick out of beating her.
She thinks she's so smart.
You know, the way she brags about the cross-pollination she does, you'd think she was a bee.
That's what I like- a nice, friendly rivalry between friends.
Well, she thinks she knows everything.
She's always talking about root rot and compost heaps and aphids.
and all that stuff.
Shh, here comes the queen bee.
Hi.
Hi, Betty, dear.
I'm going to New York to meet Ralph, but I had to stop by and see how your garden looks.
Oh, Lucy, it's lovely.
Oh, can't compare with your garden, Betty.
Oh, I don't know.
You're going to be pretty stiff competition.
Well, I know it hasn't got a chance against your garden.
As a matter of fact, I was just looking at it and I was thinking it looks so ratty I ought to plow it under and plant rutabagas.
Why, this is one of the prettiest gardens I've ever seen Well, thanks, Betty.
For a beginner.
For a beginner?
I'll bet you when the judges award the prizes tomorrow, you're gonna walk away with at least second or third.
And who do you think's gonna walk away with first, Betty?
Well, three years in a row with the same bulbs, the same soil And the same shy, modest gardener.
Lucy, that wasn't a very nice thing to say.
Well, it wasn't very nice of you to call me a beginner.
Now, Lucy Dear, you are a rank beginner.
You don't know the first thing about gardening.
I'll match my tulips against the blooms from your burned-out bulbs any day.
Oh, now look, why doesn't everybody take her green thumb and go to a neutral corner?
You keep out of this, Ethel.
Yeah, butt out, Ethel.
We'll just see who wins tomorrow.
Yeah, we'll just see.
And if I were you, Lucy, I wouldn't clear a place on your mantel for that cup.
I hope all your tulips get root rot!
Well, now, that was a pretty exchange.
Well, she makes me so mad.
There's no reason why I can't win that prize tomorrow.
My tulips are perfect.
My roses are beautiful and my lawn  Oh, good heavens, the lawn.
Ricky forgot to mow the lawn.
Well, it does look kind of shaggy.
He promised me faithfully he'd get this mowing done in time for the judging tomorrow.
Husbands make me so mad.
They're always promising you they'll do something for you, and then they don't do it.
Well, that's one problem I never have with Fred.
You don't?
Nope.
Never promises to do anything for me in the first place.
Oh Come on, let's go find my reluctant grass cutter.
Okay.
Rick, you asleep?
No, Fred, just relaxing.
Okay.
You think you'd maybe like to go down to the village?
We could browse around the hardware store and kind of poke at the power tools.
No, not today, Fred.
My day off.
Wouldn't move off this couch if my foot was on fire.
Ricky?
Oh, hi, honey.
Do you think if a person makes a promise, he should keep it?
Sure, honey.
And if a husband makes a promise to his wife and doesn't keep it, isn't he a cad?
I guess so.
Then why didn't you cut the grass?
Hi, Ethel.
What have you got to say?
Well, it looks like you're married to a cad.
Ricky!
The judges are coming tomorrow, and the lawn looks terrible!
Look, honey, it's my day off.
I don't feel like pushing a lawnmower all afternoon.
But the grass is a foot high.
What am I going to do?
Maybe you could rent a couple of sheep for the day.
Oh, you two are a big help.
Lucy's trying so hard to beat Betty and win that prize.
Ralph cut the grass for Betty.
Well, I would, too, if I had a power mower like Ralph has.
Well, good, 'cause Ralph said that you could borrow his lawnmower any day you want, so then it's all settled.
Except that today is not the day I want to borrow it.
You promised to cut the grass, Enrique Alberto Ricardo y De Acha, the Third.
Well, are you going to do it?
When she uses my full name, I'm cooked.
Go help him, Fred.
I will not.
You go out there and help him, Frederick Hobart Edie Mertz, the First.
Hobart, huh?
Hey, the boys are doing a good job on the lawn.
Yeah.
Are you ready to go to town?
Soon as I finish my list here.
Come on, Rick, how about it?
Nothing doing.
Get out of my way.
I'm not moving.
Now, Fred, for the last time, I'm warning you!
What's going on?
Now, Fred, I'm telling you for the last time, I want to cut the lawn where you're standing.
Get out of my way!
I'm not moving till you let me take my turn and quit trying to hog it all.
What are you arguing about?
Wh-What's-What's the matter?
Fred won't get out of my way.
It's Ricky.
He won't let me take my turn on the mower.
It's not your turn yet!
I still got a whole minute to go.
Not by my watch, you haven't.
Oh, come on, now.
You must be able to settle this peacefully.
I'd love to, if he just gets out of my way.
I'm not getting out of his way till he lets me take my turn.
He's been on that mower so long, you'd think he was glued to the seat.
Come on, Ricky, let Fred have his turn.
I don't have to let him have his turn.
It's not his lawnmower.
Well, it's not yours, either.
Well, it's my lawn!
Oh, now, now, kiddies.
Come on, take your turns like little gentlemen.
Well all right.
Go on, take your old turn.
Your darn tooting, I will.
Oh, come on, let's go.
Oh, now wait!
Do you think it's safe to leave the children here with all by themselves?
They may get to fighting again over that toy.
Well, I'll tell Little Ricky to keep his eye on them.
How do you start this thing?
Figure it out for yourself.
Oh, gee, isn't it a beautiful day?
Yeah, and the lawn looks great- what they've cut of it.
Yeah.
I wonder why they left the mower out by the garage.
Where do you think they've gone?
Probably in the kitchen having a cold drink.
Hey!
They're not in there.
Ricky!
Fred!
That's funny.
Well, they can't have gone far, honey, with the lawn only half-mowed.
Oh, they haven't gone far, huh?
Just to Yankee Stadium.
What?
"Harry Munson had some tickets "for the baseball game, and we took Little Ricky with us.
" Well, what are they gonna do about the lawn?
It says they'll finish it in the morning.
Oh, well, then that's all right.
All right, my foot!
I have no idea how early those judges are coming in the morning.
Oh, honestly!
If they hadn't spent so much time arguing about whose turn it was they could've had it finished.
Well, I guess there's just one thing to do.
What?
I'll have to finish the lawn myself.
You?
!
You don't know anything about running a power mower.
Well, what is there to know?
I know how to drive a car.
It can't be any harder than that.
Come on.
Interesting little machine, isn't it?
I wonder how you get it started.
Oh, fine.
Oh, look, it's got a crank.
I guess you crank it like the old Model T's, remember?
That was quite a bit before my time.
Oh, come, now, Ethel.
I only go back as far as the Stutz Bearcat and no farther.
Oh  Hey, this looks like it might be fun.
Come on, crank her up, girl.
Gee, it's got gear shifts and everything.
Oh, you got to get a good grip.
You got to get a good grip and go around there.
Lots of elbow grease.
Steady- steady around.
Oh, honey, you're not doing it right.
This is exactly the way we used to cr Same way you used to crank, huh?
Well, I've been watching those old movies on television.
Oh They do it there.
Yeah.
The late, late show.
Yeah.
Come on, crank her up.
There she goes!
Hooray!
Ethel, what do I do?
Switch it off, Lucy!
I can't!
Switch it off!
No, no!
Well Lucy, turn it off!
I don't know how to turn it off!
There must be a switch there someplace!
A switch, a switch!
Lucy, what are you do?
!
I don't know where the switch is!
What?
!
I don't know where Call the hardware store!
Ask Mr. Becks how to turn it off!
The hardware store?
Yeah!
Mr. Becks?
Hurry up, I'm getting dizzy!
Operator, get me the Village Hardware Store, quick.
Hello, Mr. Becks, this is Mrs. Mertz.
You know that power lawnmower that you sold?
I'm fine, thank you.
You know that power lawnmower that you sold, uh?
He's fine, too, thank you.
You know that power lawnmower that you sold to the Ramseys?
Well, how do you turn it off?
Oh, Mr. Becks, I haven't got time to look at a book of instructions.
M- Mrs. Ricardo's outside, and she's on the thing, and she's going around in circles!
Yes, in circles!
Huh?
Ethel!
Oh, Mr. Becks, she's not going in circles anymore.
She's-she's running amok.
Huh?
What?
: Ethel!
Now she's running amok backwards.
Huh?
Well, ho just tell me how to shut it off.
: Ethel!
There she goes again.
What?
A little gadget that's by the carburetor?
Well, where's the carburetor?
Oh, is that the carburetor?
Oh, now, what do I do?
I push down on that by the little gadget, and that O- Okay.
Just a minute and I'll see if I can find the gadget.
Lucy!
Mr. Becks, I can't even find Mrs. Ricardo.
What?
She just went by your store heading for Main Street?
Oh, no!
Lucy?
Oh, it's you, Grace.
Uh, this is Ethel.
No, Lucy isn't here just now.
Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know just where she is, but the last I heard she was on a lawnmower heading toward Main Street.
No, I haven't been nipping at the cooking sherry.
Grace, I think I hear her coming now.
Yeah, she's heading this way.
Call back later, Grace.
Oh, Lucy.
Hi.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Oh, honey!
Poor little thing.
How'd you finally get that thing stopped?
Well, you know that hedge out here that we were thinking of getting rid of?
Yeah.
We don't have to think about that anymore.
Did you hurt the lawnmower?
No, not a scratch on it.
That thing is indestructible.
Oh, Lucy.
Where have you been?
Oh, where haven't I been?
I've seen parts of Connecticut I didn't even know existed.
First that galloping grass cutter took me straight through the main street of town.
The way people came out of their houses to watch me ride by you'd have thought I was Lady Godiva.
Then what happened?
Well, the next thing I knew I was on the Boston Post Road.
The Boston Post Road?
Why did you go on a busy highway like that?
It wasn't my idea.
That beast has a mind of its own.
I stayed on that Post Road for a mile and a half.
You didn't.
Yeah.
Against traffic all the way.
Oh, Lucy.
You must've been terrified.
Oh, I was.
If I ever let my hair get dark at the roots I'm afraid it's going to be snow white.
Lucy?
What?
Was there much damage?
Well, every lawn between here and town is half-mowed.
Well, thank goodness nothing really serious happened.
That's what you think.
Just now as I was coming through the Ramseys' yard I plowed right through Betty's garden.
Lucy what happened?
All of them?
All the tulips.
When I looked back, all I saw was a sea of stems.
Oh, honey.
Oh, what am I ever going to tell Betty?
She'll think I did it on purpose.
Oh, now, don't get too upset.
Uh maybe you could get some tulips at the nursery a- and put them in Betty's garden before she gets back from town.
Oh, honey, there isn't a tulip left in the nursery with a bloom on it.
I was just there yesterday.
I feel so bad, I could cry.
Oh, dear.
I know what you could do.
What?
You can take your tulips and transplant them into Betty's garden.
Ethel, I feel bad, but not that bad.
Now, Lucy Well, maybe I'd better.
I ruined hers.
I guess it's only fair I give her mine.
Good girl.
Oh, gee, when I think of the loving care I've given those little pink blooms.
Wait a minute.
Betty's tulips are yellow.
I could never fool her with my pink ones.
It won't work thank goodness.
Gee, that's right, they were yellow, just like those wax ones I bought.
That's it!
Wax tulips!
I'll go down to the gift shop and get some wax tulips and put them in there.
Come on!
Lucy?
While we're down there, can I get some liniment for my shoulder?
Yeah.
the Boston Post Road and headed for home.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me you were going the wrong way on the Boston Post Road?
Yeah, honey.
But nothing happened- no accidents or anything.
All that happened was that people slammed on their brakes and pulled over to the side.
when they saw me coming.
Then what happened?
Well, like I said, I-I finally got the fool thing headed for home, and I went along pretty good- except for an occasional detour into someone's yard, you know- until I got to the Ramseys'.
And then that infernal machine had the nerve to plow right through Betty's tulip bed.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
How did you finally get it stopped?
Well, I-I cleverly ran it into that hedge I wanted to get rid of.
How come you didn't turn that little switch by the carburetor and shut off the motor?
Because I didn't know anything about the little switch by the carburetor to shut off the motor!
Now, don't pick on him just because you insisted on fooling around with a machine that you didn't know anything about.
And I wouldn't have been fooling around with a machine I didn't know anything about if you hadn't gone tooting off to some baseball game.
Well, you know something, honey, you're right.
I let you down.
The minute the Ramseys get home, I'll go over there and I'll tell Betty that it was all my fault.
Oh, well, honey, thank you, but that won't be necessary.
What do you mean?
Well, I know how Betty feels about her garden, so I replaced them.
Oh, good.
You went to the nursery and bought some new ones and transplanted them, huh?
Yeah, well No, the nursery was all out of tulips, so I went to the gift shop and got some wax ones.
Wax tulips?
!
Yeah.
Oh, you think you're going to fool the judges with wax tulips?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, Rick.
They look real.
You can't tell the difference.
Oh, come on, now.
Any child can tell the difference between a real tulip and a and a wax tulip.
Well, honey, do you mean that I wouldn't be able to get wax tulips that look as good as these?
Never in a million years.
These are wax.
What are you talking about?
Yeah.
By George, they are wax.
Yeah.
You know something, maybe these could fool the judges.
Oh, I hope so, for Betty's sake.
And look, for my sake, when are you going to finish cutting the grass?
I'm going to do it right now.
Right now?
!
Yeah.
It's so dark, you won't know what you're doing.
Oh, yes, I'll be able to see all right.
Besides this thing was all my fault.
The sooner I get it out of the way, the better I'll feel.
Well, okay, honey.
Fred, we're having dinner over here tonight, so just read the paper for a while, while we fix it.
Okay, okay.
: Fred, where are the girls?
In the kitchen.
Come on.
Where we going?
I want you to go to the gift shop for me.
What for?
Well, you know how Lucy said that it was too dark out there to see what I was doing?
Yeah.
She was right.
Do you mean?
Yeah, Lucy's tulips are going to be wax, too.
Come on, let's go.
Oh, no.
some of those marigolds Well, the judges are still over at the Ramseys'.
Oh, honey, is it hot, or am I just nervous?
Both- it's hot, all right.
Why are they taking so long over there?
I don't know.
They didn't find out about the tulips, did they?
Now, now, honey, calm down.
Everything will be all right, dear.
Oh, I just hope those judges are nearsighted.
That makes two of us.
What?
Uh we don't want Betty to find out Lucy!
Do you know anything about this outrage?
What outrage?
The judges have disqualified me.
Someone replaced my tulips with wax ones.
Oh, Betty, I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
Then you did do it.
Oh, Lucy, I knew you wanted to win, but I didn't think you'd stoop so low.
Oh, now, Betty, it was an accident.
I ran amok on that lawnmower of yours and just plowed through your garden.
And I-I tried to fix it by replacing your tulips with the wax ones.
I'm sorry.
Well, you fixed it, all right.
You fixed it so I couldn't possibly win.
Oh, I really I'm terribly sorry, Betty.
Look, if I win the cup, I'll give it to you.
Well, that won't be necessary.
No, I insist, Betty.
Uh, Betty, by the way, how did the judges find out that the tulips were wax?
Well, it wasn't hard.
They were melting in the sun.
Lucy, the judges are coming up the walk.
The judges are here.
This is it.
Yeah, this is it, all right.
Lucy, honey?
Yeah?
Uh, I got to tell you something, dear.
What?
Yeah?
Huh?
!
Good luck.
Oh.
Oh, please Lovely, just lovely.
Oh, thank you.
Yes.
Certainly the nicest grounds we've seen.
Oh Well, I don't think there's any doubt about who the winner will be.
You mean Lucy's won?
Oh, honey.
Well, as long as it couldn't be me, I'm glad it was you, Lucy.
Oh, thanks, Betty, but my offer still goes about that cup.
Oh, no!
Well, look, let's all go inside and have some lemonade, eh?
It's very hot outside.
These are remarkably perfect tulips.
Yeah, well, let's Well, I certainly loved raising them.
You see, I started from scratch.
I- I didn't have a compost heap.
I didn't have anything, 'cause I just moved here, as you well know.
Let's go inside and have some lemonade.
Huh?
Everybody?
And I just had a wonderful We can talk about it inside, honey.
If you notice these wonderful little, uh Oh, no!
My tulips, my tulips!
What's happening to my baby tulips?
My little pink blooms!
Oh, gracious!
These are wax, too.
Wax!
Well!
Now, just a minute.
Well, what?
Just a minute, just a minute, girls.
Honey?
Uh Betty didn't have anything to do about this.
I can 'splain.
You?
Well, start "splaining.
" Well, now, this might be very hard to believe, but you know, like you said last night, it was too dark outside to see what I was doing?
Yes?
Yes?
Well, you was right.
It was dark.
Oh, it was so dark!
It was darker than the inside of your sombrero.
And, uh, I was mowing the lawn very nicely.
I mean, you really I don't know how you did so well on the Boston Post Road, I Never mind!
Here again are Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz for our alternate sponsors.
Listen, honey, tonight I gotta tell the ladies about the new Squiz Cumb Lilt Home Permanent, and I need your help.
Oh, you sure do.
It's the new Squeeze Comb Lilt Home Permanent.
Ah, you don't understand, honey.
Just tell me the name of this thin' here.
That's the Squiz Cumb.
I mean it's a Squeeze Comb.
No, no, no, no, this.
Oh, that's the comb tip.
Thank you.
Now, this cumb tip cumbs the lotion right into your hair out of a squiz bottle.
Remember how we gals used to dip-dab those messy lotions on?
Well, that's out.
With new Lilt, you just squeeze the bottle and it combs itself right in.
It's so simple, even he could do it if he had to.
Yeah, is izzy.
Yeah, it's izzy.
And you get the most beautiful, longest-lasting home permanent you've ever had.
Thank you, honey.
Now, ladies, remember this name: Squiz Cumb Lilt.

Ethel!
Ethel?
Fred  Fred!
Fred, wake up!
: Fred!
What is it, Ethel?
Fred, this is Lucy on the intercom.
Oh, oh.
Is Ethel there?
No.
Well, where is she?
How should I know?
Well, she's your wife.
Well, did you wake me up just to rub it in?
Oh Listen, Ethel was supposed to be here an hour ago.
I don't know how I'm gonna do all the things I have to do for the Yankee Doodle Day celebration if Ethel isn't gonna cooperate with me.
Honestly!
Listen, Fred, did you try on your costume yet?
Fred, did you try on your costume yet?
Really.
Committee member Mertz reporting.
Ethel, where have you been?
I've got a million things to check with you.
Let me see that poster.
"Yankee Doodle Day Celebration.
" Uh I thought it was supposed to say "Lucy Ricardo, chairman of the Yankee Doodle Day celebration"!
Well, thanks for the billing.
Did you put these posters up all over town?
Yeah.
Did you nail them to the telephone poles like I asked you to?
All right, now.
Let's see.
Did you call all the members of my committee and ask them to be here for luncheon tomorrow?
Yep, I did.
All of them?
Yep, all of them.
Did you check the man who's writing a special song about the Battle of Campo?
Yep.
I did that.
Did you talk to Mr. Silvestri the sculptor, make sure the statue will be ready the day after tomorrow?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Day after tomorrow.
Yep, yep, yep.
Did you rent the trailer to carry it in?
Yep, yep.
Good.
Oh, boy!
I'm never gonna be chairman of another committee.
It's too much work.
For who?
For me.
For you?
!
Who do you think's been doing all the work?
How about Ouch!
Listen, Ethel, I just mean that I have all the responsibility.
I'm the one that has to sit home and worry about whether you're getting all the work done or not.
Well, now, I'll just make you a deal.
Next year, I'll sit home and worry, and you go out and nail your thumb to a telephone pole.
Oh, Ethel.
Listen.
We are commemorating a battle of the Revolutionary War.
Now, let's not start one of our own.
Well, all right.
Okay.
Did you and Fred try on your costumes yet?
Yep.
How were they?
Oh, mine's just fine.
Fred's grumbling about his as usual.
He's gonna wear it, isn't he?
Yeah, I think he is.
When I left this morning, he was standing in front of a mirror, trying on his powdered wig.
It was a proud sight.
It's the first time in 20 years Fred's been able to brush his hair.
Well, I got Ricky to read the speech at the unveiling.
You did?
Yeah.
Did you have much of a struggle?
No.
He agreed to it right away.
You mean you didn't have to trick him or anything?
Mm.
My, he's getting agreeable these days.
I know.
Things are working out beautifully.
Ricky's getting mellow just as I'm running out of tricks.
Lucy!
What?
Look at this!
What is it?
Fred!
He chewed up my slippers!
Fred wouldn't do a thing like that.
Oh, he means the dog Fred.
Oh.
I knew we made a mistake letting Little Ricky name that dog Fred.
We made a mistake letting Little Ricky get the dog in the first place.
Where is that four-legged beast?
Oh, I don't know.
He's up with Little Ricky, I guess.
Well, where is Ricky?
He's not in his room.
Well, he must be up there someplace.
Ricky!
LITTLE  Yes, Mommy?
Is Fred up there with you?
No, Mommy.
What is that you have on your face?
I'm a clown.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!
He's a clown.
March yourself right down here, young man.
He must have gotten into my makeup kit.
Yeah.
Ricky, you shouldn't put stuff like that all over your face, honey.
Daddy was a clown this morning.
Yeah, I know I was a clown this morning, but that's because I'm doing a circus number at the club.
I wanted to show Mommy how I was gonna look.
Well, from now on, you'd better not bring home your m- a-k-e-u-p.
I know what that is.
You do?
Uh-huh.
It's spelling.
It's spelling.
Yeah.
Well, now, you go on upstairs and take all that stuff off your face, and don't you ever get in Daddy's makeup kit again.
Okay, Mommy.
Go on now.
Where's Fred?
In the den, Daddy, sleeping in your chair.
In the den, sleeping in my chair.
You know, that dog uses my favorite chair more than I do.
Well, he likes to be comfortable like anyone else.
Well, then why doesn't he go out and buy his own izzy share?
He's not gonna hurt your old "izzy share.
" Besides, there's a brand-new doghouse in the backyard, and you were supposed to keep him there.
He doesn't like it out there.
Why not?
I don't know.
Why don't you ask him?
Mira, que tiene cosa el perro este no le gusta la casa de perro And stop jabbering at me in a foreign tongue.
I got enough trouble without you being cranky.
I am not cranky!
The dog sits in my favorite chair all the time.
He doesn't like the doghouse that I bought him.
He chews up all my slippers.
Ever since we got that animal, he's leading my life and I'm leading the dog's life.
I'm sorry you have to hear all this arguing, Ethel.
Oh, that's all right.
Makes me feel right at home.
I thought you were taking him to obedience school.
I have been.
Well, then, how come that he hasn't learned how to obedience?
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's because I haven't been helping him with his homework.
Well, you'd better help him with his homework, or I'm going to take him right back to the pound that's where we got him.
Oh, honey, now you don't mean that.
Anyway, he's graduating from obedience school tomorrow, and I'm sure he's gonna come through with flying colors.
Good.
Now, listen.
Did you try your costume on yet?
Oh, that's another thing.
I'll make the speech, but I'm not gonna wear that silly-looking Yankee Doodle dandy outfit that you got me.
No.
Oh, honey, you look so wonderful in a Revolutionary War uniform.
Oh, sure, yeah.
Yeah, those knee breeches will give you a chance to show off your good-looking legs.
I am not going to be seen in those silly early-American snickers.
It's knickers.
That's what I said- snickers.
Well, now, look.
you're making a mistake.
I'll leave it to you, Ethel.
Doesn't he have good-looking legs?
Come on, now, will you?
Cut it out.
Well, everybody else is wearing a costume.
Yeah, Rick.
Even Fred.
Yeah?
What's he wearing?
Oh, he's got a wonderful one.
He's gonna be the town crier.
He's gonna go through the town ringing a bell, announcing all the ceremonies.
This I got to see.
Well, will you wear it or not?
All right, all right.
I'll go learn my speech.
Okay, he will.
Oh, honestly.
They give you a fight, don't they?
What you have to go through Boy, oh, boy.
to get him into costume for a thing like this.
Hear ye!
Hear ye!
Hear ye!
Oh, Fred, you look wonderful!
Hear ye!
Hear ye!
Hear ye!
Get yourself another town crier!
What are you talking about?
I refuse to do this fool thing.
Well, why, Fred?
Well, first of all, this ding-dang wig is too hot!
How do people stand it when they have hair?
Listen, Fred.
Maybe you can do it without the wig, huh?
That's not all.
These things are killing my feet.
If their shoes pinched like these, no wonder the town criers cried.
Fred, we can get you some bigger shoes.
Oh, sure, Fred.
You gotta do something to celebrate Yankee Doodle Day.
Well, I can always stick a feather in my hat and call it macaroni.
Oh, now, Fred.
Fred!
Come on, now.
Say you'll be the town crier.
No, sir.
I wouldn't go yelling through town in this outfit if the British were to come back again!
Oh, Fred!
I'll get him to do it.
Don't worry about it.
I'll get him to do it.
Now, listen, Fred  Fred!
Fred!
Fred!
Fred!
Fred!
Where did he go?
What did he do?
He chewed up my whole speech.
Oh.
Well, now, honey, don't, don't, don't be mad at him.
He won't do these things once he's graduated from obedience school.
If you ask me, we should have sent him to reform school.
Oh "Fellow citizens of Westport, "we're gathered here on Yankee Doodle Day to commemorate, to unveil and dedicate a statue.
" "The statue will commemorate the great bravery and daring courage "of the patriots of this community "during the Battle of Campo in 17 "1777.
"I hereby dedicate this statue to the ancestors "of these brave men, "many of whom are still living Hi, dear.
in this " Oh, hi.
Congratulations are in order.
Fred graduated!
Well!
Congratulations, old man!
What's that?
That's his diploma.
Well, we'll frame it up and put it in his doghouse.
Yeah.
Did he really learn something?
Well, I told you he graduated.
Well, good for you, because I'm running out of slippers.
Hey, who set the table for my luncheon?
Oh, Ethel did.
And there's a beautiful plate of cold cuts back in the kitchen.
Oh, good.
They're delicious.
What are you doing?
These cold cuts are for my committee members.
Well, what is the principal speaker supposed to eat for lunch?
I'll fix you a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Thanks a lot.
Well, Fred, now let's see if you really graduated.
I want you to take this diploma, take it over to Little Ricky upstairs and show it to him.
Then after you do that, I want you to the diploma over to the guest house and show it to Aunt Ethel and Uncle Fred.
Oh, for heaven's sake, Ricky.
He can't do all that.
Well, you just told me he graduated from obedience school.
Well, he learned obedience, but he's not ready for The Ed Sullivan Show.
What can he do?
He can do lots of things.
He can sit up, he can speak, he can roll over.
I'll show you later.
Well, show me now.
No.
I haven't got time now, honey.
I gotta get this luncheon going.
Listen.
I paid 30 bucks for this character to go to that school.
I want to see what he learned.
I don't want to show you right now.
I will show you later.
Apparently, the wrong one went to obedience school.
Oh, all right.
Show what you learned to Senor Simon Legree.
Leash.
Come on, now, Fred.
All righty, boy.
Show Daddy what we learned here, huh?
Oh, boy, he graduated top honors, too, boy.
All right, now.
Sit up, honey.
Sit up, Fred.
Fred, sit up.
Come on, Fred, sit up.
Aw, come on, Fred.
You know how to sit up.
Now, you're not paying attention.
Come on, now.
Sit up.
Here we go.
Up we go.
Up, up, up, up, Fred.
Up!
Show Daddy how you can sit up.
Come on here.
Fred, up.
You know how to sit up.
You know how to sit up.
Come on, honey.
Never mind the lovemaking.
Just come on, now.
Sit up.
I want you to sit up.
Now, pay attention.
Up, boy.
Up.
Aw, come on, now.
You know how to it.
Look.
Like this.
See?
Like this.
I guess he just doesn't feel like sitting up right now.
No, I guess not.
Well, actually, sitting up wasn't his best subject.
Oh?
No.
Let's try speaking.
Here we go now.
All right, Fred, pay attention now.
All right, speak!
Speak, boy!
Speak!
Fred?
Speak, speak, speak!
Come on, say something.
Talk up a storm, boy!
Come on.
Say something.
Speak, Fred!
Come on, say something for me.
Just a couple of words, huh?
Oh, now, Fred, stop.
Come on.
Speak.
I guess he didn't head his class in speaking either.
Well, actually, he isn't supposed to speak unless he wants something, you know, like his dinner.
Oh.
Oh, I see.
He's a before-dinner speaker.
Yeah, well.
Here's something he does very well.
Now, watch.
Okay, Fred.
Now, roll over and play dead!
Come on, Fred.
Come on now, roll over and play dead.
Come on.
Roll over and play dead, boy.
Come on.
Down you go.
Play dead.
Fred Come on now, roll over and play dead, boy.
Fred, pay attention to me.
Look.
Look, Fred.
Fred Like this.
Are you sure they didn't give him the diploma just to get rid of him?
Well, I don't understand it.
He did everything beautifully for the instructor at school.
Look, I'm gonna give you one more chance here.
Now, you stand up there.
Now, Fred, pay attention!
Go get it, boy!
Fred, go get it.
Fred!
Go get it!
Fetch the paper, Frederick.
Can't you do just one trick, for me, Fred?
Come on.
Fred, look.
Nice Lucy.
Here.
You deserve this more than he does.
Well, he just must be exhausted for cramming for all of his exams, that's all.
He needs a vacation.
Good.
Then he can go out in the doghouse and then he can take his vacation.
He doesn't like it out there.
Well, that's too bad.
But if he's not smart enough to learn, how Shh!
Don't talk like that in front of Fred.
You'll hurt his feelings.
Come on, Fred.
Fred.
Fred!
Oh, Fred!
You big bully.
Now, what were you saying?
I was saying that if he's not smart enough to mind, he can stay in the doghouse.
You're mean!
Since when is mean for a dog to stay in his doghouse?
When the dog doesn't like the doghouse, he's not happy out there.
Why shouldn't he be happy out there?
It's a beautiful doghouse.
It's very roomy.
It's brand-new.
It doesn't have a mortgage.
And he doesn't have a wife to nag him.
Oh, there's no talking to you.
I have things to do.
We'll discuss this later.
Fellow citizens of Westport, we are gathered here on Yankee Doodle  Oh, no!
Oh, you naughty dog!
What's the matter?
He licked half of the cold cuts on that platter!
Where are you going?
I'm going to put him out in the doghouse where he belongs!
On Doodle Dandy Day to dedicate Ethel, wait till you see it.
Mr. Silvestri did a wonderful job.
Oh, I can hardly wait!
Oh, it's really It's just beautiful.
Are you ready?
Yeah.
Oh!
Oh, it's pretty lifelike, isn't it?
Oh, I should say it is.
I thought I saw him squeeze the trigger.
Ha, ha!
Isn't it great?
It is just great!
When do you take it over to Jessup Green?
Well, I'm going to get it there just a few minutes before Ricky does the unveiling.
That way nobody will be able to peek at it before the ceremony.
Where is Ricky?
He's over at the newspaper office.
They're taking some pictures for the Yankee Doodle Day celebration.
LITTLE  Mommy!
Mommy!
What?
Fred ran away!
Fred ran away?
Which Fred?
My dog!
Oh, nuts.
Are you sure?
Are you sure he ran away?
His rope's chewed up, and there's a hole in the fence.
Oh, dear.
It's my fault for putting him out there in that doghouse.
Now, honey, he's around here someplace.
We'll find him.
Oh, dear.
Fred!
Fred!
Fred!
Fred?
What do you want?
Oh, not you.
We're calling the dog.
He ran away.
Oh, Mommy, where is he?
We'll find him, honey.
I promise.
Don't worry, honey.
Fred!
Lucy, your phone's ringing.
Lucy..
What?
Your phone.
Your phone.
You keep looking.
We will, honey.
Fred!
Fred!
Fred!
Hello.
Oh, hello, Grace.
Yeah.
Yeah, we just found out a minute ago.
He did?
Which way did he go?
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah.
Thanks, Grace.
Oh, dear!
Fred.
Fred!
Fred!
Can't you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you.
Well, why didn't you answer?
I thought you were calling the dog.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Tell Ethel and Ricky to come in here right away.
Ethel!
Yes?
Come on.
Lucy wants you.
What's up?
Grace Munson just called and said that she saw a dog that looked like Fred running up the road past her house.
Oh!
That's almost a mile away from here!
Maybe it wasn't our Fred.
Well, we gotta track down every lead.
Now, listen, I'm gonna drive over to the Munsons'.
You go out and get Bruce Ramsey, honey.
Look all around the neighborhood.
Hear?
Okay, Mommy.
You stay here in case there're any more calls, will you, Ethel?
Oh, sure.
Lucy, you call us, now, if you find him.
Yeah, I will.
I'll look around here.
Maybe he's hiding inside.
I'll look in the kitchen.
Fred!
What?
I'm calling the dog.
Oh, for corn sakes.
I haven't been right once today.
Maybe it'd make things simpler if you changed your name.
To what?
Rover.
Very funny!
I'll go and look in the den.
I'll go upstairs and look, Fred.
Hey!
What was that?
Something sounded like a wreck out there in back.
No, no.
It was out here, Fred.
No, it was in back.
I know it was out there.
My ear tells me it's in the back.
It sounded just like it was out front.
It's out back!
Now go on!
Lucy, are you all right?
I'm all right, but look at him.
Oh, my goodness, honey.
What happened?
Oh, I jumped in the car and forgot all about the trailer and backed right into that elm tree.
Wouldn't you know it?
The poor guy got through the Revolutionary War without a scratch, but five minutes with you and he's finished.
Oh, be quiet, Fred.
Uh, Lucy, maybe we can glue it back together.
Glue what back together?
This is all that's left of him.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, you gotta do something.
You've got to fix it.
Oh, how can I fix it, for heaven's sake?
Doesn't look very good.
Lucy.
What?
The unveiling's in an hour.
What are you gonnna do?
Oh, dear, I don't know.
But while I'm thinking, will you drive over to the Munsons', find Little Ricky and go find the dog, will you?
Sure.
Yeah.
Oh See you later, shorty.
Ethel, what am I gonna do?
They'll throw me out of the Historical Society.
Oh, you'll be lucky if they don't throw you out of town.
Oh, dear.
Hey, I'll call Mr. Silvestri and see if he's got another one.
Another one?
They don't make statues in pairs like bookends.
Oh, it doesn't hurt to ask.
Mr. Silvestri?
This is Mrs. Ricardo.
Yeah.
You know the statue you made for us?
Well, by any chance, do you happen to have a spare?
Oh, you don't, huh?
Well, could you make another one?
Oh, good!
How long will it take?
Two weeks!
Oh, dear.
Well, could you make it sooner?
Well, I was thinking in about an hour, maybe?
Yeah, well, all right, all right, all right, Mr. Silvestri.
Well, you start on it right now, huh?
Yeah.
What?
Why do I want another one?
Why?
Why?
Why, Ethel?
Why do we want two of them?
Uh well Westport is growing and it may become twin cities like Saint Paul and Minneapolis.
Yeah, well, you know, Mr. Silvestri, Westport is growing so, it just might become twin cities like Saint Appolis and Minnie Paul.
Minneapolis and Saint Paul.
Oh.
Well, you just go ahead, Mr. Silvestri, and we'll think up a reason later.
I mean, I'll tell you the reason later.
Yeah.
Oh, uh, Mr. Silvestri, incidentally, is the, uh, the first statue insured?
Oh!
Oh, thank goodness!
Yeah, well, just start on the on the other one.
Thanks very much.
Oh!
Thank goodness that's over.
Now all you have to do is postpone the ceremonies for two weeks.
Yeah.
Postpone the?
I can't postpone the ceremonies!
Everybody in town will be over there in an hour.
Well, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I forgot all about the ceremonies.
Oh, dear.
Oh, Ethel.
Hey, I got an idea.
No, maybe it's too wild.
If you've got an idea that you think is too wild, I don't want to hear it.
No, I think it will work.
Yeah, I think so.
You know, we're going to have ice cream and cake later.
Are you having a good time, honey?
Yes.
Fred!
Fred, you found Fred!
Oh, let him through here.
Oh, Fred!
Yeah, I found him.
I found him all right.
Oh, bless his little heart.
Where was he?
Well, you will never believe it.
He was sitting on the steps of the obedience school.
Oh, Fred.
Now, why do you suppose he went there?
Well, I guess he heard he had a bad report.
He was trying to sign up for summer school.
Oh, maybe.
Your mommy's here, honey.
You'll see her pretty soon.
And your daddy's getting ready to make a speech.
Did you know that?
Yeah.
Fellow citizens of Westport, we are gathered here on Yankee Doodle Day to unveil and dedicate a statue- a statue which commemorates the great bravery and daring courage of the patriots of this community during the Battle of Campo in 1777.
So I hereby dedicate this statue to these brave men and women, and to their descendants, many of whom are still living in this community.
And now, for the unveiling.
Here we go!
Lucy?
Lucy!
Shoot, if you must, this old redhead.

"Christmas Show"  And now, "I Love Lucy.
" How's it here, honey?
Over to the left a little.
No, no, the other way.
No, I want it in the middle so the mantle won't look lopsided.
Santa Claus doesn't care if the mantle looks lopsided.
Oh, well.
There you are, partner.
Thank you, Daddy.
You're welcome.
Now, when you get up in the morning, honey, Santa Claus is going to have that chock full of goodies.
Yes, sir.
Now, off to bed, son.
In a minute, Daddy.
What are you doing, dear?
I'm waiting for Santy Claus.
You've got to go to bed now.
I'll go to bed after Santa Claus gets here.
But, honey, Santa Claus is not going to come and bring the tree and the presents and everything until you go to sleep.
He won't?
No.
Why, Mommy?
Yeah, why is that, Daddy?
Why?
Uh, why?
Well, uh, you see, um partner, Santa Claus comes all the way down from the North Pole and he has all these reindeers with him.
And when he gets here, he circles around in the sky until he gets a signal.
Now, you know who gives him the signal?
Who?
Yeah, who?
Who?
I bet I know.
It's the Sandman.
The San the Sandman, that's right.
Yeah, the Sandman gives him the signal.
That's right.
When all the little children are in bed, the Sandman runs up to the roof and he says, "Santa Claus, all clear"!
So you got to go to bed.
Why, honey, that's fascinating.
You see, young man?
You got to go to bed right now.
Okay, Mommy.
Good boy.
Mommy.
What?
There aren't any steps.
How does Santa Claus get down the chimney?
Yeah, how does he do that, Daddy?
Well, I took care of the "why" and the "who.
" You take care of the "how.
" Uh how, huh?
Well, um now, you see, Santa Claus doesn't need any steps, honey.
He, he When he comes, he brings the North Pole with him and he slides down like a fireman.
Oh.
Good, good, good.
All right, son, off to bed.
Yeah, come on, honey.
Good night.
Night, Daddy.
Good night.
: Fred, Ethel, come on.
Come on in.
Where do you want it?
Right there, Fred.
Wait a minute.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
I think right about in here.
Oh, it's a beauty, Fred.
How much do I owe you?
It's from us.
Well, that's very generous of you.
Oh, it was nothing.
Nothing?
The tree cost five bucks.
Well, it's Christmas Eve, all right.
The children are tucked in their beds waiting for Santa Claus, the stockings are hung by the chimney with care, and we have our very own Scrooge.
Look, honey!
Oh, that is a beautiful tree.
Isn't it?
It's a present from me and Ebenezer.
: Well, thank you very much.
Would you lay off, Ethel?
Anyway, I thought Santy Claus was supposed to foot the bill for the tree.
Well, he does ordinarily, but this year, we're doing it for him.
You just try and think of yourself as one of Santa's little helpers.
Well, I'll try.
Okay.
Come on.
Let's get the tree trimmed.
Yes.
Okay.
Honey?
What?
Is it right where you want it?
Back by the window a little bit.
Oh, okay.
Here.
Come on.
You help me, Ethel.
Yes, ma'am.
Be very careful with these now.
These are the only bulbs that I have.
All right.
You take that box there.
Oh, I love doing this.
Isn't this wonderful?
Honey?
Yes, dear?
See how it looks from the front, eh?
What do you think?
Well, it looks pretty good, except there's a branch on the right side that spoils the shape.
Which one, honey?
This one right up here.
Fred, would you go down to the basement and get your saw and cut that off for me?
It's a little unbalanced.
Oh, now, honey, maybe we can hang something there.
He doesn't have to go all the way down to the basement and get a saw.
Now, look, honey, the tree has to be balanced.
You know that.
We can't have one branch out like I've been putting up trees with that kid for the last 15 years.
: He came prepared.
That's right, Fred.
Gee, the four of us have spent a lot of Christmases together, haven't we?
We sure have.
Yes, sir, and it's been great.
It's even been better since little Ricky came along.
That's right, honey.
Oh, Fred, now that you've cut that branch off, it makes the other side look too full.
You better trim that branch on the other side, make it all even.
You know, honey, I've been thinking.
Our life has sure been different since you told me you were going to have the baby.
I almost never got to tell you.
What do you mean?
Don't you remember?
Oh, Fred, that skinny branch on the top just looks awful.
It's going to have to come off.
Don't you remember, Ricky?
I tried to tell you all day, and I never got a chance because you were so busy?
Oh, now the other side looks uneven.
That lower branch there.
Honey, finally, in desperation, I had to go down to the club while you were working and give a note to the maitre'd for you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
And now for the For you, Ricky.
Oh, thank you.
Excuse me.
Pardon me, please.
Oh, isn't this wonderful?
Listen to this.
"Dear Mr. Ricardo, "My husband and I are going to have a blessed event.
"I just found out about it today, "and I haven't told him yet.
"I heard you sing a number called "'We're Having a Baby, My Baby and Me.
' "If you will sing it for us now, it will be my way of breaking the news to him.
" Isn't that wonderful?
Of course I'll do it for you.
Sure.
Eh, mae?
Oh, wait a minute.
I got a wonderful idea.
Why don't we bring the couple up here, and I'll sing it right to them, eh?
Come on, let's bring them up on the floor.
Come on, folks.
Come on.
We just want to wish you luck.
Who is it?

And why not?
Our future looks brighter But definitely We're having a baby I bet he's going to look just like you.
Oh, I hope not.
We're having a baby I'll bet she'll speak with an accent like you.
She?
Yeah.
We're having a baby My baby And me.
It's silly.
It happened five years ago, and I'm crying all over again.
It's okay, honey.
So am I. I'm crying, too.
Me, too, but for a different reason.
Fred, what have you done to that tree?
Well, I got so carried away with the story, I forgot what I was doing.
Oh, Fred, for heaven's sake.
Well, you got to admit that it's even on both sides.
Well, how do you think we're going to trim that?
Well, why can't we trim it with those branches I just cut off?
Fred Mertz, you march right down to the corner and get another tree.
Okay, but who's going to pay for it?
I will.
I will.
No, you won't.
He will, and one word out of you, and I'll tell Santa Claus that you were a bad little boy, and you won't get any presents.
You can't squeal on me.
I'm one of his helpers.
Oh, get out of here.
You might as well get the lights ready, dear.
Okay, honey.
Gee, I just love this old ornament.
It's been on our tree ever since I can remember.
Cascabeles, cascabeles Llenos de alegria All the way Oh what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh : Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh I don't know what's happened to my voice lately.
I don't seem to sing well anymore.
Lately?
Anymore?
Now, that's not very nice.
I grant you, my voice isn't quite what it used to be.
It's exactly what it used to be.
That's, uh, what's wrong with it.
Why do you say that?
I used to sing quite well, as I recall.
Well, dear girl, then something is wrong with your memory.
What do you mean?
Well, a few months after you told me that the baby was going to be born, you wanted to sing at the club in a barbershop quartet.
Oh, I remember that.
Fred and I did that with you.
Right.
Boy, that was a terrible evening.
It was not.
It turned out very well.
It was one of the most embarrassing nights of my career.
Well!
I'll never forget it.
The three of us started the number thinking George Watson was under the sheet in the barber chair.
Little did we know that the tuneless wonder was there instead.
In the evening, when I sit alone a- dreamin' Of days gone by, love To me so dear There's a picture that in fancy oft' appearing Brings back the time, love When you were near When you were near It is then I wonder where you are, me darling And if your heart to me is still the same For the sighing wind and nightingale a- singin' Are breathing only Your own sweet name ETHEL &  Your own sweet name  Sweet Adeline : Sweet Ad My Adeline My Ade At night, dear heart A For you I pine For y In all my dreams In all Your fair face beams You're the flower Of my heart Sweet Adeline  Sweet Adeline.
That's it.
Yeah, that looks beautiful.
Hey!
Hey, Fred!
Isn't this a dandy?
Oh, boy!
Look at that; that's a beauty, Fred!
Fred, that's better than the first one.
And the best thing of it is, because it's getting so late, they guy let me have it for a half a buck.
It has just been proven to Fred, once and for all, there is a Santy Claus.
You bet!
And he also gave me some mistletoe.
Now don't go getting any wild ideas, Ethel.
I'll try to restrain myself.
Oh, Fred, this tree is just perfect.
Absolutely perfect.
Yeah!
Except for this one little branch right here.
Now if you could just No!
Oh, no you don't.
Nothing doing.
Okay, leave it alone.
All right.
Hey, Fred, let me help me put the lights on, eh?
Sure.
Let me help, too, huh?
Okay, here.
Oh, boy.
Give me a strand.
Okay, Fred.
Want to help me?
There you are.
Fine, thanks.
Ricky?
Yeah, honey?
Won't you give me just one little hint about what you're giving me for Christmas?
You know, you're worse than your son.
You'll find out tomorrow morning.
I know, but I just want to think about it.
Come on, give me one little clue.
All right, I'll give you one clue.
Good, what is it?
It's a gift.
Oh!
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
Merry Christmas, you great big wonderful, adorable, lovable husband you.
Do you love me?
Mm-hmm.
How much?
A lot, but not enough to tell you what your Christmas present is.
Oh!
Now what makes you think that's what I wanted to know?
And what is it?
You'll find out tomorrow morning.
Oh, all right.
Freddy?
Yeah?
Go ahead.
Go ahead and what?
You know what this means, don't you?
Yeah, it means you're an incurable optimist.
Oh, Fred!
: Honey, I'm only fooling.
Merry Christmas!
Ah, Merry Christmas, you great big adorable husband!
All right, Fred, plug in the lights and see if they work.
Hey!
: Hey!
Fred, congratulations.
This is the only time that the lights have worked on the first time in 15 years.
We usually have to spend an hour testing all the bulbs to see which one hasn't burned RICKY &  Out.
Okay, let's start testing the bulbs.
You know, I'm kind of glad it happened.
It makes it seem more like Christmas.
Girls, why don't you get the ornaments, huh?
Oh, yeah, come on, this is the part I love.
What's little Ricky getting this year?
Well, I don't know what Santa Claus is going to bring him, but we're getting him a new set of drums and a bike.
Hmm!
Yeah, we're probably spoiling him, but he won't be little for long.
Gee, it's amazing how much he's grown.
Seems like only yesterday that he was born.
Will you ever forget that night?
I had a new show at the club, and Lucy insisted that I make it, and I was going crazy trying to be in two places at once.
Well, it wasn't any picnic for me, either, waiting at that hospital while you were doing the show.
Well, what about me?
I thought I'd lose my mind sitting at home, waiting for the news.
Of course, I was lucky.
All I had to do was have the baby.
You're right, honey.
You three were so nervous that night.
I remember, it was almost time for me to go to the hospital, and you all sat and watched me like I was going to explode any minute.
Is it really due any minute?
!
How do you feel?
!
Are you sure you're all right?
!
I think we ought to have a rehearsal.
A rehearsal?
For what?
A rehearsal for when you get the signal.
Everything should go like clockwork.
I don't want to lose a minute getting you to the hospital.
Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
He's right, he's right.
Now, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, there's no problem, dear.
The room is reserved at the hospital.
The doctor's number's right here by the phone.
My suitcase is all packed.
All we have to do is go downstairs, get a cab and go.
I know, I know, but who's going to call the doctor?
Who's going to carry the suitcase?
Who's going to hail the cab?
That's what we got to rehearse.
Rick, I'll do anything you suggest.
Hey, hold it, hold it, group.
Look, you split it up any way you want.
I'm going to go lie down.
All right, honey, I think that's a good idea.
You need your rest.
Here, I'll help you, dear.
That's nice.
Come on, honey.
Don't you worry about anything now.
No, I won't.
You leave everything to us, honey.
Okay.
Take it easy.
Now, listen, Rick, I'll tell you how we ought to do this.
Now, wait a wait a now, wait a minute, wait a minute, I'm in charge of this thing.
After all, I'm the baby's father.
Take over, captain.
All right.
Now, let's see now.
First of all, one of us has to call the doctor.
Who's going to do that?
I'll do that.
Okay.
Soon as we get the signal, you rush to the phone.
Okay.
All right.
Now, you carry the suitcase.
Right.
I'll look after Lucy.
I'll get her coat, see that she gets downstairs all right, and we'll hail a cab.
Now let's rehearse.
Okay.
Good.
Okay.
Let's go.
Now let's make believe that Lucy just came out of the bedroom, see?
And she comes out of the bedroom and she says, "The time has come.
" Go!
Hello, Dr. Harris.
We're leaving for the hospital with Mrs. Ricardo now.
Good-bye.
Hey, that was pretty good.
We did that in a few seconds.
Fine.
Well, now, let's do it again so we'll have everything perfect.
Okay, now, the main thing is to be calm so we don't get Lucy excited.
That's right.
We got to keep calm.
Good.
Put that over there so we can start right where we were.
Get it over there and Get it all where it was at the beginning, now.
Go back over there now.
Right.
Are you ready?
Yep.
Yep.
Okay.
Now, Lucy comes out of the room, and she says, "The time has come.
" Go!
Hello, Dr. Harris.
We're leaving for the hospital with Mrs. Ricardo now.
Good-bye.
Hey, that was even better than before.
Sure it was!
Yeah, that was wonderful.
Fine.
Well organized.
Okay, now we know what to do.
Now, let's put this stuff right where it was so we know where everything is.
Now all we have to do is just wait.
That was fine, kids.
That was wonderful.
Just think tomorrow night at this time, I'm going to be a father.
Yes, sir, and I'm going to be a godfather.
And I'm going to be a godmother.
Uh-huh.
Ricky, this is it.
This is it.
This is it!
This is it!
Let's go!
Come on!
Let's get going!
Somebody better call the doctor.
Call the doctor!
No.
That's my job!
That's my job!
You get the suitcase!
The suitcase!
Suitcase!
I got it, Fred!
Give me the suitcase!
We have to hurry, Ricky!
We have to hurry, she says!
Oh!
The line is busy!
Ricky!
The line's busy!
The line is busy?
Why doesn't somebody go hail the cab, and then you call Dr. Harris.
Go!
Go get a cab!
Go get the cab!
Go get a cab!
Go get a cab!
I'll get the cab!
I'll get the cab!
I'll get the cab!
Hey!
Wait for me!
For heaven's sake.
Why didn't we get together on this?
The four of us sure got the same idea at once.
We sure did.
LITTLE  Mommy, Daddy, is it time to get up?
He can't find four of us here.
Come on, go in the kitchen.
: Yeah.
Oh, boy!
Listen, as long as we've gone to this much trouble, one of us ought to go in there and let Little Ricky see us.
Yeah.
That's right.
Boy, you've got to get up early if you want to be Santa Claus around here.
Just a minute.
Ouch!
