{START OF EPISODE 1}
Well, good morning, dear.
Good morning.
Uh, Lucy What?
I know you must have a very good reason but, uh you just dropped two cups of coffee out of the window, didn't you?
No, I gave it to the painters on a scaffold out there.
Oh, I forgot, they're painting the building.
How about some breakfast for a non-painter?
Yes, sir, coming right up.
Hello, Mrs. Foster?
This is Ricky Ricardo.
Oh, good morning, how are you?
Fine, thank you.
Is Bill home?
No, Bill's gone out of town for a few days.
Oh, I see.
Well, look, I might as well tell you.
Monday is our wedding anniversary Oh?
and I want to get Lucy some real pearls, and, well, they're so darned 'spensive, you know, and-and Bill told me that you work at Joseph Jewelry Company, and, uh, well, sometimes they give the employees a discount and I thought that maybe, uh I can save you 20%.
Twenty percent.
Honey oh.
All right, Sam.
Yeah, that's right, Sam.
How do you want your eggs, scrambled or fried?
Sam.
I'll talk to you later, Scrambled.
Scrambled.
Did Lucy just come in?
That's right, Sam.
Well, look, why don't you come down to my apartment and we'll talk about it.
I'll be here for another half hour.
Okay, I'll do that, Sam.
Good-bye, Sam.
See you later.
Who was that?
Uh Sam.
He plays the tuba.
He's a tuba player, you know?
Oh.
Scrambled.
Scrambled, yeah.
Morning, Lucy.
Hi.
How about some breakfast?
Well What will you have- eggs, coffee, rice?
Rice?
Nobody eats rice for breakfast.
Well, I'm giving it to Ricky for a reason.
I don't get it.
Well, now, suppose you were my husband and I served you rice for breakfast.
What would you think?
I think I'd eat at the drugstore from now on.
The rice is a symbol.
It means something.
Oh, you want him to stop by the Chinese laundry.
No, day after tomorrow is our wedding anniversary.
Oh, the rice is just a subtle reminder, huh?
Mm-hmm, and if the rice doesn't get to him I have a lot of other things planned.
I have the date on the calendar circled, see?
Well, that's subtle.
And I left my wedding ring by his plate.
Lucy did you ever think of saying "Ricky, day after tomorrow is our wedding anniversary"?
Oh, I wouldn't say a thing like that.
If he can't think of this by himself I'm just not interested.
Well, I can't stay and watch this tender little scene.
Let me know how you make out.
Okay.
Oh, sit down, honey.
Breakfast is all ready.
Good.
Rice.
Yeah, rice.
Honey, doesn't that rice remind you of anything?
It sure does.
Makes me think of when I was a little boy in Cuba.
We used to eat rice for breakfast all the time.
Oh.
Sweet of you to think about it, honey.
Oh, that's all right.
Honey, what day is it?
Saturday, why?
Are you sure?
Well, now, let me see.
Yesterday was Friday.
I know tomorrow is Sunday.
Friday, Saturday Yeah, it's Saturday.
Well, I'm not sure.
I better check.
Yeah, it's Saturday, all right.
Well, I'm glad that's settled.
Oh, look, there's a big red circle around Monday.
I wonder what that's for.
Mm Monday, huh?
Yeah.
Can you think of anything important that happens on that day?
No.
Oh, sure, I know.
That's the day they collect the garbage.
Lucy how many times have I told you not to leave your wedding ring lying around?
Honey, that little ring means a lot to you, doesn't it?
It sure does, honey.
Cost me 50 bucks.
I I got to go down and see Fred.
I'll see you later.
Hi, Luce.
Hi.
Ricky around anyplace?
He just went downstairs to see you.
Oh, I've been up on the roof checking on the painters.
I'll catch him.
Okay.
There's nobody down in our apartment.
Are you sure he's looking for me?
Sure.
That's what he said.
Well, maybe he's looking for me up on the roof.
Why don't you sit down and have a cup of coffee?
He's got to come back.
No, thanks, I'll find him.
Okay.
Did you find Fred?
Uh oh, yeah, yeah, I found him, yeah.
You sure must have had a lot to say to each other.
What do you mean?
Well, you couldn't have said more than a couple of words.
Oh, well, you know he's busy with the painting and the stuff, you know, so I told him I'd talk to him tonight.
Mm-hmm.
See you later.
Bye, honey.
Listen, Ricky you know, that isn't the garbage collection day.
No, I wish I could figure out what that's circled for.
Look at that date again.
Are you sure that doesn't mean anything to you?
No.
No?
No.
Well, bye.
Bye.
Hey, Lucy, I can't find that guy anyplace.
Who are you looking for now?
Ricky.
Ricky?
You were just talking to him.
I was not.
Fred, what's the matter with you?
Ricky just went out the front door and said he was talking to you a minute ago.
Just talked to me?
Yeah.
Well, I better catch him.
Why?
Because one of us has cracked his crock.
Hi.
Ethel, the strangest thing just happened.
What?
Well, Ricky just told me he was downstairs talking to Fred a minute ago, and Fred was just here and said he hadn't seen Ricky all morning.
No!
Yeah, why would Ricky make up a story like that?
Where do you suppose he really was?
Um I got to go, Lucy, good-bye.
Ethel what's the matter with you?
What do you know?
Look me in the eye.
Ethel!
Look me in the eye.
You know something, don't you?
Who, me?
No, I don't know anything.
Ethel Now, Lucy Ethel If I Oh, Lucy, I wasn't going to tell you but I just saw Ricky coming out of Now, I know he's got a reason.
I know there's a good explanation.
But where do you suppose Ricky was when he told you he was downstairs talking with Fred?
Where?
In the Fosters' apartment.
So what?
Why wouldn't he want me to know he was talking to Bill Foster?
Well, there's no reason except that Bill Foster is out of town.
So, Bill Foster's out of town.
I still don't why he wouldn't want me Bill Foster's out of town?
!
Now, Lucy, don't jump to conclusions.
I'm not.
I'm not jumping to conclusions.
I trust Ricky.
That's good.
If Bill Foster's out of town and Grace Foster stayed here and Ricky said he was going down to talk to Fred and he went to Grace Foster's apartment instead he must have a good, simple logical explanation for it.
Oh, Lucy, you sure are sensible.
Oh, now, Lucy Lucy, don't cry.
Oh, Lucy, you got to give Ricky a chance to explain.
Oh, Lucy, you're much more attractive than Grace Foster.
I am?
Oh, certainly.
You're much prettier than she is.
You got a better figure.
You got much more personality.
As a matter of fact Grace Foster hasn't got anything that you haven't got.
She has so.
What?
She's got Ricky.
You'll find your life will begin The very moment you're in Argentina Yeah!
If you're romantic, seÃ±or Then you will surely adore Argentina You'll be as gay as can be If you will learn to sing, sing like a Latino For mister, soon as you learn Then you will never return to Manhattan When you hear "yo te amo" You'll want a kiss and then If she should say "maÃ±ana" It's just too late, you know you're gonna meet again  You will never forget Argentina Yeah!
For there are rumbas and tangos to tickle your spine Moonlight and music and orchids and wine You'll want to stay Down Argentina way!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Pretty good, pretty good.
We we finished together, for a change.
Hey, watch it, here comes the union.
Allah, Allah, Allah Hey, Ricky.
Hello, Julie.
Listen, when I was in the office before some dame called.
She says her name is Grace Foster.
What are you whispering about?
That's business.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What kind of business?
She says she can't come down to the club tonight and she wants you to go up to her apartment.
She says she'll phone you when the coast is clear.
Well, look, I can't tell you what it's all about, but it is business.
Business, huh?
What a character he is.
Hey, let's try that intro again, will you?
Hi, Rick.
Oh, hiya, Fred.
I've been looking for you since yesterday morning.
What did you want?
What do you mean what do I want?
Well, Lucy told me you wanted to see me.
What do you want?
Oh  I wasn't really looking for you, Fred.
I wanted to go down and see Grace Foster and I used you as an excuse.
Oh, yeah?
No, not "Oh, yeah"?
Monday is our wedding anniversary.
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
And I want to get Lucy some real pearls and Grace is gonna get them for me at a discount.
I'm waiting for her to call me right now.
Ah, too bad.
I thought maybe something exciting was going to happen around here for once.
Lucy thinks that I've forgotten that it's our wedding anniversary, and she's been real grumpy.
Yeah, just forget an anniversary and they grump right up.
She won't even speak to me.
Oh?
That's what I want you to do, Fred.
Don't worry, I'll look after it, Rick.
Thank you, old man.
Hello, Lucy.
Hi, Fred.
Well, I'll see you folks later.
Hello.
Hello, Ricky?
This is Grace.
Can you talk?
Oh, hello, Sam.
Yeah, that's right, Sam.
Oh she left the room.
I can talk now.
I brought home a whole selection of pearls for you to choose from.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Does Lucy suspect anything yet?
No, not a thin'.
Oh, it would be terrible if she found out what we're up to.
Oh, yeah, it would be awful!
Well, don't you worry.
I think we got her completely fooled.
When can you come down?
I'll be down right away.
Fine, I'll be waiting.
Oh, uh I got to go down and see Fred.
Oh.
I'll see you later.
Lucy, I came up to see if you'd like What's the matter with you?
Oh, Ethel, it's all true.
I've lost him.
What?
I listened on the extension.
Grace Foster asked him to come down and he flew to her waiting arms.
Oh, Lucy!
I still can't believe that he chose her over me.
After all, don't 11 years of faithful service count for anything?
Oh, you poor little thing.
You'd think if he was going to let me go like this he'd at least give me a gold watch.
Or a letter of recommendation.
Gee, Ricky and Grace Foster.
I got to see what's going on in that apartment right now.
How can I do it?
Gee, that's a tough one.
You could you could hang me by my heels and lower me out the window.
No!
It's two floors down!
Besides, I might drop you.
Oh, yeah.
No no, there's just no way we can see what's going Hey, wait a minute.
Why do we have to see?
We still have ears, don't we?
The furnace pipe.
The furnace pipe!
The snooper's friend.
Let's go- come on.
Here's a nice set.
How do you like these?
Oh, these are beautiful.
Yeah, I'll take these.
Why don't you look at the rest?
I've got all these cases full.
Oh, all right.
Here's one with three strands.
I'll just slip them on so you can see what they look like.
Oh, those are real pretty.
I'll take those.
Oh, wait a minute.
We've got lots more to look at.
All right.
Good old furnace pipe.
I can't hear anything.
Where can I turn up the volume?
Albert!
What?
Lunch is ready.
All right.
Where's 2A?
Come in, 2A, come in, 2A.
Over.
Stand over here by the window, Grace so I can see you better.
Well?
That's the most beautiful sight I've ever seen.
He always tells me to get away from the window.
He says I'm standing in his light.
I'd always heard you Cubans were great flatterers.
Albert!
What?
Come and eat your lunch!
I'll be there in a minute.
What do you say, Grace?
Let's open up another case.
Okay.
They're up there drinking!
You certainly know how to give expensive presents, Ricky.
Oh, well, what's money?
After all, these are for the sweetest, most wonderful woman in the whole world.
Oh, what a guy.
Grace, you sure have been wonderful and I've finally made up my mind.
You have?
Yeah, it's a tough choice to have to make but the one for me is  Albert!
Is who?
Is who?
Albert, are you coming?
!
I told you I'd be there in a minute!
Oh, for heaven's sake, Albert, go eat your lunch!
Oh, I can't stand it, Ethel.
I can't stand it anymore.
I got to see what's going on.
Look- the painters left their clothes here.
They always leave them over the weekend.
Well come on.
Why didn't I think of this before?
Get into them!
Oh, Grace, I can't make up my mind.
Those are real pretty but, you know, these are very pretty, too.
Well, you better look at them both again.
After all, if you're going to spend that much money, you want to be sure.
I'll try these on for you.
Okay, thank you.
What's the matter?
Oh, will you help me get these unfastened, Ricky?
Sure.
Hey, hey, there's been an accident!
Two guys are in trouble on the painters' scaffolding!
Let's see if we can help them!
Oh, oh, hold that rope!
Hold the rope!
Let's get them in here!
Oh, my goodness, they've got the paint all over them and everything.
Watch it there.
Easy.
Watch it.
Careful.
Careful.
Lucy!
Lucy?
!
Holy Come on, get her in here!
Lucy!
Oh!
Why is she so heavy?
Well, the other guy's hanging on her feet.
Come on in.
Come on.
Get in.
Get the other fella now.
Hold it, hold it.
I wonder what makes this one so heavy?
Oh, no wonder.
Ethel, have you lost your mind?
What's the matter with you girls?
Are you crazy or something?
What's the matter with you?
Sit down!
Look at you!
Lucy what were you doing out there?
I got a better question.
What are you doing in here?
What are you doing in Grace Foster's apartment when her husband's out of town?
Uh Uh Well, you both got the same story.
Now, listen, Lucy Well, Grace, I guess we might as well tell her the whole truth.
I'm afraid so.
Yeah.
Lucy this is going to be a terrible shock to you.
Well?
Well, you know Grace works at Joseph Jewelry Company.
And you know how valuable pearls are.
Real pearls.
Well, she took all these pearls from the store- thousands of dollars' worth.
There's enough in there for two people to run away to Mexico and live there for the rest of their lives.
You mean, you and-and Yes.
Grace and I have finally decided that these are the pearls that I should buy you for your anniversary.
Anniversary!
Yes!
Anniversary!
Happy anniversary, Lucy.

Fine, Fred.
That's fine.
What a talent.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, for my next trick Oh, not another one.

And you're going to have to beg me before I do it.
Oh, please, Fred.
Well, well, well, if you're going to say please, okay, I'll do it.
It'll only take a second.
You have to be a volunteer from the audience.
This is the most mystifying bit of prestidigitation in my entire repertoire, and I shall need a volunteer.
I'm here.
Well, well, there's a very beautiful young lady.
Now I'm going to ask you to look at these and see that they are securely locked and that it will be impossible for you to remove them.
Very funny.
I'm sorry, Fred.
I didn't mean to spoil Aw, come on, Ethel.
Let's get out of this trap.
I'm coming, Houdini.
Listen, Ethel, I hope I didn't hurt his feelings.
Hurt his feelings?
Listen, I've seen him do those magic tricks a hundred times.
This is the best audience he ever had.
We didn't intend to stay all afternoon.
See you later.
That's all right.
Bye-bye, dear.
Bye, Ethel.
Oh, poor Fred.
What do you mean, poor Fred?
Poor us.
I'm certainly glad they finally left.
I got a lot of work to do this afternoon.

I thought you were just saying that to get rid of Fred.
No, I got to learn my part for this television show.

That doesn't go on till tomorrow.
I know, but the rehearsal is tonight.
Well, I'll just clean things up then Tonight?

Well, honey, that's why they're having the rehearsal tonight- so I can be there.
I'm very important to the show.
Well, you're very important to me, too.
Gee, I never get to see you anymore.
Well, honey, I'll take you to dinner and a movie some other night, huh.
You've been saying that for a long time.
You know how long it's been since I've seen a movie?
How long?
Well, I can't remember the title, but there was a guy named Ben that won a chariot race.
I understand they have pictures with sound now.
Never mind that.

What?
These are the trick handcuffs.
I took them down to the barbershop to show the boys.
Oh, great.
Well, any idiot should have seen the difference.
Almost any idiot.
Well, isn't there any way you can get these things unlocked?
Sure.
You open them with a key.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Where's the key?
I never had one.
Those are old Civil War handcuffs.
Civil War?
!
Civil war?

Have you been saving them ever since then?
Never mind.
They were given to me when I did a police benefit, and that was way back in 1919.
Oh, no.
Well, genius, what now?
Are we going to go through life like this?
Now, honey, remember.
When we were married, you wanted to be joined together in matrimony.
And as I recall, it was "till death do us part.

That event is about to take place right now.

Well, now, there must be a way out of this.
Now just a minute.

That's a new suit.
Well, it's either that or we're going to have to sleep in our clothes all night.
Well, then, we'll have to sleep in our clothes all night.

All right, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Let me figure it out.
Now let's turn around.
Let's turn around.
No, not there.
Turn over here and climb into bed from the end.
No.
That's no good.
Then we'll be on the wrong side.
I want to sleep where I usually do.
All right.
Crawl around.
There you are.
Oh Good night, dear.
Good night, honey.
Ricky?
What?
I can't sleep on my back.
Well, try it!

I'll go around the other way.
There we are.
Ah, good night, dear.
Good night.
Ricky?
What?
I can't sleep this way either.
Why not?
Because I want to sleep in my own bed and on my stomach.
That's impossible.
Well, you're doing it.
What are you talking about?
Well, if there was only some way we could get on the other side of each other.
Come here, I think I can figure it out.
Wait a minute, let me put the light on.
Now, look Yeah?
Now just stand here a minute.
Now let me figure something out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, that will do it.
Now hold still.

What are you doing?
Wait!
No!
I'll give you five dollars if you can get out of this one.
What are you doing?
There.
Look.
See?
See?
I'm here.
That's just the right way that we started from.
You were there, and I was here.
Now let me get it straight.
You want to sleep on your stomach in your bed.
Right.
Right?
Okay.
Oye, que pesada estas.
Eleven years marriage, 22 pounds.
Oh!
There.
Ow!
There you are.
Lucy, are you up yet?
I'll be right there.
Just sit down, Mr. Walters.
They'll be here in just a minute.
All righty.
My goodness!
This is Mr. Walters, the locksmith.
Mr. Walters, Mr. And Mrs. Ricardo.
How do you do?
Uh, well I'm certainly glad to see you.
Yes, I imagine you are.
My, my, that is an old pair, all right.
They don't make them anymore, you know.
Yeah, we know, we know.
What museum did you steal them from?
Uh, Mr. Walters, you can get them off, can't you?
Oh, yes, I think so, Mrs. Ricardo.
I, uh Ricardo?
Say, you any relation to that bandleader that Ricky Ricardo?
Yes.
He's a close relative- very close.
Oh, I recognize you now.
You are Ricky Ricardo, aren't you?
Yeah, that's right.
Well, imagine that.
Me and the missus went to your Tipicany Nightclub on our 40th wedding anniversary.
Saw you do that thing with the drum- that, uh that, uh Bobolink number.
"Babaloo.
" Yeah, that's what I said.
Oh, say, wait till I tell the missus.
She'll never believe me.
Look, would you give me your autograph so that she'll know that I was here?
Just make it out to Abigail.
Abigail?
Abigail, yes.
Oh, she buys all your records.
She's played that Bobolink number a million times, I'll bet you.
Told her I was going to get her a drum for Christmas.
Sweet, sweet.
Oh, she likes you.
Sweet, sweet.
She would rather hear Uh, Mr. Walters, the handcuffs?
Oh.
Oh, yes, yes.
You know, I'm probably the only locksmith in America that has a key to fit these.
Yes, sir.
Now, let's see here.
See what we got.
Uh-huh.
You know, I always had a hankering for show business.
No.
Won an amateur dance contest once.
No.
My friends all said that I'd make another Freddie Astaire.
No.
But what with one thing and another I finally drifted into the locksmith game.
No.
But I always figured that I missed my real calling.
No.
But who knows.
What with one of these days with television and all I may still get my real break.
No.
None of these fit.
Look, couldn't you file them off?
Oh, no.
That's tempered steel.
You wouldn't want to go through that, son.
Say, I'll tell you what.
I got a collection of real old handcuff keys at home- the only one in existence.
My grandfather started me on it.
Yes, grandy used to say, "Son " He called me son even though I was his grandson, and Oh, um I'll dash on home.
How long will it take?
Oh, I can easily make it in two hours.
Two hours?
!
Two hours?
!
Where do you live?
Yonkers.
Oh, I wonder where that locksmith could be.
He's been gone five hours.
He would be the only one with the key.
Well, he'd better hurry up.
I'm going to miss the television show now.
Come on.
Hello?
Mr. Walters?
Well, what happened?
What happened?
Oh, no!
What happened?
Well, look, Mr. Walters, don't come to the apartment.
What happened?
Wait a minute, will you.
Mr. Walters, don't come to the apartment.
No.
Look, go to Television Center, Studio A. Studio A. Meet us there right away, please.
I'm on the air in one hour.
Don't forget now.
Better be there.
All right, good-bye.
What happened?
He had a little trouble getting the key and guess why.
Why?
He locked himself out of his house.
Oh.
Come on, will you?
Oh, honey!
Sorry.
Wait a minute.
Oh.
How you doing?
I haven't made a dent.
Oh.
I hope the locksmith gets here quick.
Does the producer know about these handcuffs?
Nobody saw you come in.
Yeah?
Mr. Ricardo, you're on in two minutes.
Oh, we might as well tell him.
We'll never make it in time.
Oh, you can't do that.
The producer will kill me.
You'll never work this show again.
Well, I don't care if I ever work this show again.
You don't think I'm going to go on television handcuffed to her, do you?
As your agent, I say go on.
Well, as myself, I say no.
Do I get a vote?
No!
No!
All right.
Are you going to cancel, or shall I?
You cancel your 90%.
My 10% goes on.
You might as well go on, Ricky.
They'll find out why you're canceling.
It'll be in the papers.
Oh Get on stage, Mr. Ricardo.
All right, all right, we're coming.
Well, come on, will you?
I got a wife and two kids.
All right, come on.
Come on, honey.
Now, listen.
You stand behind me as much as you can.
No funny stuff now, understand?
Yes, sir.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
We had a wonderful time.
We had such a grand time.
Good night.
It's so nice to have met you.
What a wonderful evening.
Lucy.
Oh, Lucy, this has been a most momentous club meeting, just too, too, really.
Bye, Lucy.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
I will let you know all about it, dear Oh, okay, dear.
Bye-bye.
just as soon as I can.
Yes.
Bye-bye.
Hi.
Oh, is the club meeting over?
Yeah.
They just left.
Oh, darn it.
I thought I'd get home on time.
What happened?
The roof fell in on me.
What do you mean?
Oh, Ethel, it's just terrible.
The club voted to use the money in the treasury to put on an operetta on the 25th and I'm supposed to be in charge.
So what?
Well, there isn't enough money in the treasury.
Well, you're the treasurer of the club- you ought to know.
How much is there?
The books say $246.
Well?
Well, about a year and a half ago Ricky wanted to go over my household account, and I was ten dollars short.
So?
Well, I borrowed ten dollars from the club treasury so that my household account would balance.
Well, ten dollars.
My goodness.
Well, you don't understand, Ethel.
That was only the beginning.
From then on, I borrowed from the household account so that the treasury account would balance, and then I borrowed from the treasury so the household account would balance, and on and on and back and forth like a tennis game, and somewhere along the line, I lost the ball.
What do you mean?
Now there's no money in either account.
Oh, my goodness, you are in a spot.
What are you going to do?
Well, I was going to pay back the treasury with my household money, but Ricky doesn't give it to me until the first of the month.
And you need the money on the 25th.
Gee, I'm worried.
You know how fat I look in stripes.
Why don't you ask Ricky to advance you the money?
Oh, I thought of that.
I don't look good in black and blue either.
You'd better start thinking.
Well, I've got one last desperate idea.
What is it?
Well, we can save the royalty fee- that's $100- if we write the operetta ourselves.
Wait a minute.
And then We could save the royalty fee?
Who is "we"?
"We" is Ethel Romberg and Lucy Friml.
That's who "we" is.
Oh, no, you don't.
Just forget all about me.
Oh, all right, I'll just have to get someone else to sing the lead.
The lead?
Yeah.
That's all right, though.
I can find someone else.
Oh.
The lead, huh?
Who could possibly do it but you?
Now the next thing we have to do is get someone to sing the male lead for nothing.
Who?
Who else but John Charles Ricardo?
Hi, Lucy.
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
That's okay.
I got the story pretty well along.
You want to hear it?
Sure.
It's called The Pleasant Peasant.
She's really a princess in disguise.
That's my part, huh?
Oh, well, I kind of wanted to talk to you about that, Ethel.
Now, Lucy, you said nobody could possibly sing the lead but me.
But now look, If Ricky's going to do the male lead it's only logical that I sing the female lead.
Oh Besides, I have a much better part for you.
What?
Camille.
Camille?
Yeah, Camille- the snaggletooth old queen of the gypsies.
Oh, no.
Now, Lucy Now, Ethel, give me one good reason why you should do the female lead instead of me.
You can't carry a tune.
Well!
If you're going to get petty about it.
All right, we'll audition right now.
I'll go first.
Get over.
Mi.
Now you.
Mi.
I been working on the railroad All the livelong day.
Where do I go to get my teeth snaggled?
Good girl.
Now let's hear the story of the operetta.
Well, we open on the outside of the inn, and there's dancing on the green.
And then Squire Quinn- that's Fred- comes out of the inn.
His inn is on the River Out.
And then you come on and you sing a song about nobody being in love with you.
Then the queen of the gypsies comes on- that's me, I guess- and predicts that you're going to fall in love with a prince and be married, but it will come to a terrible tragedy.
Then Ricky comes in- he's the prince- and he takes one look at you and falls madly in love with you.
That'll take a little acting.
Never mind.
Well, anyway, they have the wedding, and then, like the gypsy predicted, tragedy strikes.
On the way to the prince's castle, the band of highwaymen hit the prince on the head, kidnap you and take you to their cave in the forest.
Now, the reason the highwaymen kidnapped the peasant girl is that the wicked witch has turned the leader into a frog.
Huh?
Yeah.
The leader of the highwaymen is the princess' brother who was separated from her when they were tadpoles.
But she doesn't know this, see.
And that's the end of the first act.
The first act?
Yeah.
How many scenes are there in that?
Only 18.
Eighteen?
!
That will take a lot of scenery, won't it?
Now, don't get excited.
I've already rented the scenery and the costumes.
But don't you have to pay for that stuff in advance?
Sure, I gave them a check on the club treasury.
But there's no money in the club treasury account.
You don't give me credit for anything.
I dated the check the day after the show.
By that time there will be a lot of money in the bank.
Oh, dear.
Want to hear the rest of the story?
Why not?
Now, in the meantime, the prince, who thinks he's a peasant but he's really a frog, you know, is working for Squire Quinn at the inn, and the only way  I am the good Prince Lancelot I love to sing and dance a lot I have an eye for a da-da-da None of that "da-da-da" stuff.
Let's hear the words.
They're good words; let's hear them.
Good words?
"Lancelot " "dance a lot.
" Who wrote this operetta anyway?
Who wrote it?
Did you ever hear of Victor Herbert?
Well, sure.
Well, all right then.
Go ahead.
I am the good Prince Lancelot I love to sing Say, Lucy, does this costume look right to you?
Is that what they sent over?
Well, there's a lot of stuff downstairs, but I can't figure it out.
Oh, I'll just have to go down and check.
I have to do everything around here.
Come on, I'll take care of it.
You two keep on your rehearsing.
Come on now.
Don't stop.
Yes, Mrs. De Mille.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Ethel.
I want to talk to you about something.
What?
Well, look, honey, I, I You know I love Lucy, and she's a wonderful girl and she's got wonderful qualities, but, uh, confidentially when she sings, she hits a bad note once in a while.
Once in a while?
Oh, you've noticed.
Well, what are we going to do about it?
You don't have to worry about it.
I've already taken care of it.
I talked to the women, and she isn't going to get a chance to sing by herself.
Every time she opens her mouth, the entire cast will join in.
I am the good Prince Lancelot  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League production of The Pleasant Peasant.
I can't come out in front of the curtain because I have my costume on.
Overture, maestro, please.
We're the pleasant peasant girls Happy pleasant peasant girls We're so happy we could fly With an H-A-P-P-Y We're the pleasant peasant girls Happy pleasant peasant girls With a happy mom and a happy pappy We're so happy that we're almost sappy We're the pleasant peasant Girls.
Oh what do we do today?
Let's have a picnic down by the River Out.

Oh, wonderful.
Look, there is Squire Quinn.
Well, well, good morning, girls.
Good morning.
Good morning, Squire Quinn.
There, there, there.
Well, what a bunch of pleasant peasants you are.
I'm the good Squire Quinn And I wanna shout About my inn on the River Out You can easily see the shape Squire Quinn is in But wait till you see the shape his inn is in The rooms are lovely and full of space There's running water in every place Yes, and lots of water if you can stay Long enough for a rainy day Every room has a beautiful view Of sailing boats on the river blue You can watch the boats when the wind blows But the squire didn't put in windows Lots of ale and stout are on my shelf And I take a drop or two myself A drop, he says, the squire's got the gout The stout makes him ail And the ale makes him stout So ends my story, and I think that this'll Be a good time to wet my whistle That's all there is, and it leaves no doubt That the squire's in his inn And his inn's on the Out.
Well, well, good-bye, girls.
I've got to go now and polish off a few tankards.
Good-bye!

Is that you, sweetie pie?
Oh, gee, I'm glad you're home.
How's about a great big?
Well, see you later.
Lucy come here.
What's the matter?
I stopped by the bank on the way home and they show me this.
What's that?
Your check to the beauty parlor.
I write a check to the beauty parlor every month.
Yes, I know that, but they don't always have a little note in the back like this one: "Dear teller, be a lamb and don't put this through till next month.
" Now what do you got to say for yourself?
That's why they call them tellers- they go around blabbing everything they know.
Lucy.
Now, look.
I'm serious.
I don't know what's the matter with you.
Every month, every single month your bank account is overdrawn.
Now, what is the reason?
You don't give me enough money?
I don't give you enough money?
!
Well, we both agree.
That must be the reason.
Now look, Lucy.
Yes, sir?
Do you think this is a game we're playing?
No, sir.

What subject?
Well, tell me something, will you?
How often is Ethel's checking account overdrawn?
Never.
Never?
!
How do you manage that?
It's easy.
I never had enough money at one time to open a checking account.
What?
!
She spends money like I was printing it in the basement.
Printing in the basement hah!
Let's face it, Rick, when it comes to money, there are two kinds of people: The earners and the spenders, or as they are more popularly known, husbands and wives.
Yeah.
Brother, if they had to make the dollar they would think twice before spending it that fast.
Yeah.
What's so tough about earning a living?
Yeah.
Have you ever done it?
No, but I could.
Ha!
I could, too.
Ha!
Listen, holding down a job is a lot more difficult than lying around the house all day long.
Lying around the?
Lying around the?
Is that all you think we do?
Yeah.
Well, now, let's be fair, Rick.
Every once in a while, they get up and play canasta.
Who do you think does the housework?

Yeah.
Oh, anybody can cook and do the housework.
Ha!

Okay, we will.

Mmm.
Oh, the coffee's good, too.
Where did you learn to do all this?
Oh, I'm just a natural-born cook, I guess.
Honey, what kind of a job are you going to?
What kind of a job are you going to get?
Are you going to go to an employment office?

Now, what do you do?
What kind of jobs do you have open?

Thank you.
Oh, hiya, Fred.
Hi, Rick.
Well, don't you look cute.
What are you doing with that scarf on top of your head?
Oh!
Oh, you mean this.
I was cleaning the apartment and I didn't want to get any dust in my hair.
Hey, take a tip from me, from an old housewife like me, will ya, and don't let that iron get too hot.
You might scorch something.
Really?
Yeah.
You mean, uh like this?
That's the, uh That's the general idea, yes.
Well, I thought I'd tell Lucy that this was, uh an original new design.
That story won't work.
No, eh?
Why not?
Ethel has three blouses with that same design.
Listen, you know what's really tough?
Silk stockings.
Yeah, how about that?
They're really tough to iron.
You're not supposed to iron silk stockings.
No?
No.
Fred, anybody knows that.
Look, just make sure that you use plenty of starch when you wash them.
Oh.
I see.
I'll show you.
I got a couple of them over here.
I'll show you.
Here.
See?
Oh, beautiful.
Now, you seen better creases than that anyplace?
My boy, you're a regular Ricky Margaret McBride.
Why, sure, man, sure.
Oh, you know something?
I been thinking about that dinner, you know?
Yeah?
Yeah, I think it's I think it's silly for both of us to cook each one of us to cook a whole meal, you know?
Yeah, yeah.
So I thought what we should do is pool our talents, and I'll cook the main course and you cook the dessert.
Okay.
Now let's see.
How about arroz con pollo?
Well, which is that- the main course or the dessert?
Chicken and rice.
Oh-ho!
I seen my mother do it a hundred times.
I love it.
Well, listen, I tell you what.
Can you bake a cake for dessert?
Well, will I- a big juicy one, seven layers thick.
Yeah?
With frosting?
Globs of frosting.
Boy, this is going to be the best meal our wives ever had.
All right, girls, this is the first stop.
Now you understand from your indoctrination session you're here for one purpose- to work.
Yes, ma'am.
Ricardo, I'm going to put you to work chocolate dipping.
You say you've had experience.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm a dipper from way back.
Yes?
They used to call me the big dipper.
Ew.
There's no room in this plant for levity, however weak.
Yes, ma'am.
All right, Ricardo, that's your place.
Mertz, I'm going to put you to work down in the chocolate boxing department.
Follow me.
Hey, this is fun.
What do you do when your nose itches?
Is that so?
There's a fly in here.
Hiya, Fred!
Hi, Rick.
How do you like my new invention?
What is it?
Well, I can sweep the rug and read the sport pages at the same time.
Pretty clever.
Why sure.
You know, the only reason that women claim that housework is so hard is because they don't use their heads.
I guess so.
What you got there?
Oh, I brought my cake.
Oh.
Seven layers of luscious devil's food.
Wait till you see it.
What happened to the other six layers?
Well, they're all in there.
Some of them just didn't rise very much.
Well, you can put on a lot of frosting.
What do you mean, "put on"?
The frosting's already in it.
In it?
Yeah.
I mixed it all up together before I baked the cake.
Well, maybe you'd better wait until breakfast and serve it as a pancake.
Oh, never mind, now.
How about your part of the meal?
Well, it's coming along fine.
Good.
Yeah.
I got the rice cooking.
Hey, listen, by the way, what do you know about rice?
Well, I had it thrown at me on one of the darkest days of my life.
No, never mind that.
I mean how much do you think we should use for four people?
Well, I don't know.
People like that stuff.
Well, how does one pound per person sound?
That sounds about right.
That's good, because that's what I put in- four pounds.
Good.
That's good.
Well, let me see.
I got the, uh I got chickens cooking in the pressure cooker.
Yeah.
Now, how long do you think they should take?
Oh, I don't know.
I'd say about an hour and a half.
What was that?
!
What was that?
!
Hey, Rick, what was that noise?
Why, who took the oh!
Don't burn yourself.
Hey, what happened to my chickens?
!
I had two chickens in there!
Well, they got to be here someplace.
Chick, chick.
Chick, chick, chick.
Chick, chick, chick.
Hey.
What happened?
Are those your birds up there?
Yeah.
Now what are we going to do?
Well, let's wash them off.
Come on.
All right.
Turn the water on.
Here's the brush.
Give me some of this stuff, here.
Give me some more of that stuff over here.
Attaboy.
This one's really strong.
Hey, Ricky, what's this?
!
Oh, no!
Catch the rice!
Hurry up, Fred!
Hurry up, will you?
!
Hurry up, Fred!
It's still coming!
Hurry up, Fred!
Get it!
Get it!
Get it!
It's like a volcano!
Get going!
I'm going!
Fred, here!
All right, girls.
Listen carefully.
This is the wrapping department.
Yes, ma'am.
Now, the candy will pass by on this conveyor belt and continue into the next room where the girls will pack it.
Now, your job is to take each piece of candy and wrap it in one of these papers, and then put it back on the belt.
You understand?
Yes, sir.
Yes, ma'am.
Let her roll!
Let her roll!
Well!
Wait here.
Somebody's asleep at the switch.
Whew!
What are you doing up here?
I thought you were downstairs boxing chocolates.
Oh, they kicked me out of there fast.
Why?
I kept pinching them to see what kind they were.
This is the fourth department I've been in.
Oh?
I didn't do so well either.
All right, girls.
Now, this is your last chance.
If one piece of candy gets past you and into the packing room unwrapped, you're fired.
Yes, ma'am.
Let her roll!
Well, this is easier.
Yeah.
We can handle this okay.
Listen Ethel, I think this I think we're fighting a losing game.
Here she comes.
Fine.
You're doing splendidly.
Speed it up a little!
Ricky?
Fred?
Ricky?
I wonder where they are.
Lucy, have you got any bicarbonate of soda?
Yeah.
I got some in the kitchen.
I'll get it.
Oh, here's a note.
"Dear girls, please do not go in the kitchen "until we can explain.
We'll be back in a few minutes.
" Gee, I wonder what's in there.
I hate to think.
You stay here.
I'm stronger than you are.
Oh, Ethel!
What is it?
Ethel, it's a shambles!
Food all over the place- on the floor, on the walls, on the ceiling- it's a mess.
All over- food.
I don't want to clean it up.
Oh, no, I can't.
Lucy, oh!
Oh, Lucy, thank goodness you're home.
Something awful happened.
No.
Yeah, don't go in the kitchen until Fred and I I've already been in there.
Oh oh, well.
Don't worry about it.
We'll clean it up.
Thank you.
Listen, we don't know how you girls feel about it, but we'd like to forget the whole thing.
We're lousy housewives.
Hideous.
Well, we're not so good at bringing home the bacon either.
We got fired off our first job.
Yeah.
Well, look, uh what say we go back to the way we were?
We'll make the money, and you spend it.
Oh, that's great with me.
Good idea, Fred.
A- And listen, girls, we never realized how tough it was to run a house before.
Aw So just to show you our appreciation we brought you a little present.
Really?
You did?
For each one of you a five-pound box of chocolates.
The part of Mr. Snodgrass was played by Alvin Hurwitz, forewoman by Elvia Allman, and the chocolate dipper by Amanda Milligan.

{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Ah!
Lucy, are you up in the attic?
Yeah.
Come on up, Ethel.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you doing up here?
Oh, I'm getting this trunk ready.
Ricky's going on tour, you know.
Really?
Yeah, he's taking the band on the road for three weeks.
Oh.
Well, I guess this is big enough for my clothes.
What can I find for Ricky's things now?
Well, I guess this will do.
You mean you're going with him?
Why, sure.
You don't think he'd go away for three weeks and leave me here all alone, do you?
Um, no, I guess not.
Besides, what fun could he have on the road all alone with just the boys in the band?
Lucy, when did he ask you to go with him?
Lucy, when did he ask you to go with him?
Lucy Well, he will!
He just hasn't thought of it yet.
Oh, look at all the junk in here.
Oh, here's that fish that Ricky caught in Lake Chautauqua.
He had it mounted.
My, a rainbow sardine.
Oh, Ethel, look at this.
Would you believe that five years ago I wore this on 5th Avenue and I was the hit of the Easter parade?
Oh, you must have been a doll.
I was- a veritable doll.
Oh, this was my Greta Garbo period.
Oh, no!
Did you wear one of these?
Yeah.
Oh, I had forgotten all about this.
What?
My saxophone.
Your saxophone?
My saxophone.
I used to play it in the high school band at Celeron, New York.
Oh, no.
Not a girl saxophone player in a band.
Well, I had a reason.
I was dating a football player and the band got to go on trips with the team.
I did it the hard way.
I played left tackle.
Come on, play something for me.
Play something.
I guess I'm a little out of practice.
Well, I knew what it was.
"Glow Worm"?
That's right.
Now what do you want to hear?
Uh, "Stardust.
" Okay.
Hey Lucy?
Hey, Lucy!
Hey!
That sounds like "Glow Worm.
" I know.
Everything I play sounds like "Glow Worm.
" That's the only piece I ever learned.
Well, how'd you play with the band?
Well, I used "Glow Worm" for the audition and then I just marched up and down and puffed my cheeks out and wiggled my fingers.
Oh, no.
I'll bet I marched a million miles for that stale football player.
Well, enough of my grimy amors.
I got to get this trunk out of here.
I'll get Fred to haul it down for you.
Oh, will you, honey?
Thanks.
Oh, hi, honey.
How's everything?
Oh, everything's wrong, honey.
Oh?
Yeah, some of the arrangements are missing, one of the guys got the flu and I got to replace him and the tailor won't have my tuxedo ready in time.
Oh, that's too bad.
He won't have it ready till Friday and we got to leave Wednesday.
Would you do me a favor and send it to me?
Send it to you?
Yes, please.
Well, I wasn't figuring on being here.
Oh?
You didn't tell me you were planning to go out of town, too.
You going to visit your mother?
No.
I was going to visit my husband.
Oh?
Well, I know it's presumptuous of me- I'm only your wife- but I kind of expected to go along, too.
Oh, no, honey, now, now, that's impossible.
Why?
Well, that's just out of the question, that's all.
Now, I'll write out the address for you, and you can mail the tuxedo out to me.
I think I will visit my mother- permanently.
Oh, now look, honey, let's not have a scene.
Well, why can't I go along, too?
Honey, we're doing one-nighters, one-night stands.
It's a very, very terrible life.
You travel all day long.
You work all night long.
Well, I don't want to stay here all alone.
Look, besides, we're going on a bus.
We need every inch of space for the people in the show.
Maybe I could lie up on top of the luggage.
Honey, just relax, will you?
Here's the address.
I got to call some saxophone players.
Saxophone players?
Hello.
Hello, is Ralph Brady there?
Will you please tell him to call Ricky Ricardo when he comes home?
Ricky Ricardo.
R- i-c-k-y c, c- like in "Cuba.
" No, no, no.
Cuba.
C- u-b-a.
B, B- like in "barracuda.
" That's right.
Ricky Ricardo.
Yeah.
Please have him call me, will you?
Thank you very much.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Lucy, what are you doing with that thing?
Well, it's mine.
I used to play in the high school band at Celeron, New York, and you don't have to look any further for a saxophone player.
Look, honey, even if you could play you couldn't go on the tour.
You couldn't travel with a bunch of men.
You wouldn't fit in.
You're not one of the boys.
What about your harp player, Nancy?
She's not going and neither are you.
Ay-yi-yi.
Hello, Ned?
Look, Ned, this is Ricky Ricardo.
We're having rehearsals tomorrow at 3:00 in the afternoon at the club.
I'm trying out some saxophone players.
Could you be down?
Hey!
What?
Have you seen Ethel?
She went shopping, Fred.
What are you doing with that saxophone?
I'm practicing.
I'm going to audition for Ricky's band today, you know.
Oh.
I'm glad I found out it was you making that noise.
I thought there was something wrong with the plumbing.
Oh, Fred, come here a minute.
Fred, you used to be around a lot of musicians when you were in vaudeville, didn't you?
Yeah.
Why?
Well, the real reason Ricky won't let me go on tour with him is because he doesn't think I'll fit in with the musicians.
What can I do to show him that I'm one of the boys?
You know, how can I act like a musician?
Well, that's easy.
Stay up late, don't eat right, get circles under your eyes and read nothing but the Racing Form.
No.
Now Fred, I'm serious.
Tell me how to act like one of the fellas.
All right, then, I got to tell you.
Now, first you got to dress like musicians.
Oh?
They have their own getups.
Then you have to speak their language.
They don't talk like human beings.
They don't?
No.
When one musician meets another musician  That's good, Ralph.
You got yourself a job.
Will you go in the office and make the deal?
Thanks, Rick.
You're welcome.
All right, fellas, let's take 628, huh?
Got it?
Here we go- one two  Lucy!

How'd I ever miss that?

Do I get the job?
Well, you know, to tell you the truth, I can't make up my mind.
Oh, well, take your time, man.
Take your time.
I think we'd better try it again.

All right, here we go.
A- one a-two    That was pretty cool, huh, man?
How ya like those hot licks, dad?
Or don't you dig be-bop, be-bop?
Look, Lucy, this might come as a big surprise to you after that brilliant audition that you just gave us Yeah, dad.
but, um, you cannot have the job.
Ew When I go on the road, I want you to stay home and be a good little girl.
Yeah, well, I'll stay home.
What do you mean by that?
Oh, nothing.
Hi.
Here's Fred's hat and gloves.
Oh, thank you.
What'd you want with them?
Meet my secret lover.
What are you talking about?
Well, yesterday down at rehearsal, I got a wonderful idea.
You know, I think Ricky would take me on tour with him if I can convince him of one thing.
What?
That it isn't safe to leave me at home.
I don't get you.
Well, I'm just going to leave these things lying around, and when Ricky finds them, I'm going to be very flustered and I'm going to be unable to explain to whom they belong.
You mean he'll think you've got a Uh-huh.
Oh, come now, it isn't that funny.
You think you're safe?
You'd better be careful.
You know Ricky's temper.
Well, you keep an ear cocked, and if you hear too much commotion, you come up and save me, huh?
Okay.
I hope I get here on time.
Okay.
Lucy, I'm home.
Oh!
Oh, Ricky, you're, you're home so soon.
I didn't expect you to come so soon.
I thought you'd call like you usually do.
Oh.
I sure wish you'd called.
Gee, don't you look nice.
Where did you go this afternoon?
Oh, nowhere.
Nowhere at all.
Well, why are you all dressed up for?
No reason, no reason.
Oh.
Uh honey, could I have a piece of the paper?
Sure, dear.
Thank you.
Lucy.
Yes, dear?
What is this?
Oh!
Uh, tha uh, your hat.
I don't remember buying a hat like this.
You sure this is my hat?
Yes.
Your head must have shrunk.
I suppose these are my gloves too.
Lucy, who was here this afternoon?
No one.
No one, really.
Lucy this hat, these gloves Hey, he must still be here.
Where is he?
I don't know what you're talking about.
And don't you go in that bedroom.
The bedroom!
Aha!
He was in the closet all the time.
Lucy, who is he?
!
I don't know what you're talking about.
My goodness!
If you're going to act like this, I'll be glad to have you away for three weeks.
Now, Lucy, I'm telling you Hey, what's all the ruckus up here?
Fred, I'm glad you're here.
Maybe you can calm him down.
I've had enough.
Well!
What's the matter, Rick?
Oh, Fred, something awful happened.
Well, now, pull yourself together.
Pull yourself together and tell me all about it.
Well, I don't know how to tell you about it.
I don't know how to start.
I just came home here What's my hat doing up here?
There are more important things.
I came home Did you say your hat?
Yeah, it's my old derby.
Are you sure?
Sure, I'm sure.
Look.
Feels pretty good.
Looks pretty good, too.
I think I'll start wearing it again.
I suppose these are your gloves, too.
Yeah, those are my gloves.
It couldn't be him.
I wonder why Lucy Why, the little devil.
She wants to make me jealous so I'll take her on that tour with me.
You mean she's pretending that these things belong to another man?
Yeah, not that I believed her for a minute.
Yeah, I could see that when I came in.
How do you like that?
She was pretending that this fellow was in the closet all the Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What's that gleam in your eye?
Oh, I'm going to catch that little redheaded mouse in her own trap.
How?
I'm going to get a real guy to come over here tonight and I'm going to hide him in that closet and I'm going to say to her, "Someone is hiding in that closet," and then I will demand that she opens the door, and when she does, oh, brother, will she be surprised.
I'm going to call the musicians union.
I'll bet that Julie will dig up someone for me.
That's a pretty dirty trick.
Yeah, I know.
She's got it coming to her, though.
Hello.
Hello, Julie.
This is Ricky Ricardo.
Oh, hello, Ricky.
How are you?
Fine, thank you.
Listen, Julie, will you do me a favor?
I want you to dig up some guy for me- someone that I don't know.
Uh, wait a minute.
Make it three or four guys.
We might as well do it right.
Ricky, I'm sorry you're so upset.
I didn't know it had such an awful effect on you.
Not have an effect on me?
When my happy home is turned asoonder?
Oh, honey, your happy home is not turned "asoonder.
" Look, Ricky, I thought maybe if I could make you jealous, you'd take me on your trip with you.
There isn't anyone else, honey, I just made that up.
No, don't try to make me feel good.
I heard that guy come out of that closet and go out the front door.
Now, honey, I did that.
Ha!
Well, I did.
When you went into the bedroom I went over to the closet door, I opened it, and I slammed it.
Then I went to the front door and I slammed it.
That's impossible.
All right, it's impossible.
It is impossible.
It is a physical impossible.
What do you want me to do, draw you a diagram?
Look, when you went into the bedroom, I ran over here, I opened the closet  Aah!
What's the matter?
Nothing, nothing.
Uh nothing.
Lucy there's somebody in that closet now, isn't there?
Oh, no.
That's the silliest thing I ever heard of.
Lucy, I want to see who's in that closet.
No.
No!
No!
Uh No.
Whoever is in that closet better come out!
It's no use pretending.
He caught us.
What are you talking about?
I never saw this man before in my life.
If you never saw him before in your life, how come he's in the closet?
I don't know.
Now, Lucy, I want an answer.
Uh uh Well?
He was giving me saxophone lessons?
Lucy, why don't you tell the truth?
Yes, Lucy, tell the truth.
Oh, shut up!
Look, Ricky, if I'd known there was anybody in there, do you think I'd be fool enough to come over here and  Uh Well?
When he gives me saxophone lessons he turns the music.
We're going to clear out that closet.
There's more?
Everybody in that closet come out!
Oh, no!
I wonder where can she be.
She's been gone for two hours.
It would serve you right if she never came back.
What a dirty trick.
Now, Ethel, it was only a joke.
Some joke.
She must have been terribly upset to be gone this long.
There she is.
Hello!
Hello, Ricky, this is Julie.
Oh.
Hello, Julie.
Gee, I should have called you sooner, but I've been trying all over town and it's just no soap.
What are you talking about, Julie?
Well, I'm sorry, but I couldn't find anybody to send over there tonight.
Well, that's all right.
You Esta metido en el closet!
Ay ay, dios mio!
Lucy!
Lucy!
Lucy!
The man in the closet was played by Charles Victor.

{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Morning, Lucy.
Oh, hey!
I'll be right there, Ethel.
What did you lock the door for?
I almost broke my neck.
I just wanted to see what would happen if I did something different for a change.
What are you talking about?
Life.
I've just been thinking about life.
Ethel, Ricky and I are in a terrible rut.
What do you mean?
Everything has become routine.
We do the same dull thing every day.
We see the same dull people.
Thanks a lot.
I didn't mean you.
It's just that nothing new ever happens.
Why, I can tell everything Ricky's going to say and do before he does it.
Ah, can you?
Wait till he wakes up.
You'll see.
He'll call, "Hey, Lucy, is the coffee percolated yet"?
Then he'll come into the kitchen half asleep looking like a zombie stagger over to the stove say, "Oh, I could have slept all day " scratch his leg while he pours some coffee for himself kiss the air in my general direction stagger off into the bedroom.
It isn't funny, Ethel.
It's tragic.
I know it is.
You know, I just realized I can do exactly the same thing with Fred.
I'll bet you can.
Right now he's sitting down with the morning paper to do the crossword puzzle.
And just about this time he's discovered he can't find his glasses.
So he'll call to me  Ethel!
He hasn't varied five minutes in 22 years.
I'm up here, Fred!
He won't find his glasses up here.
Oh, yes, he will.
They'll be on top of his head.
You're kidding.
And when I tell him, he'll say "Hmm.
If they'd been a snake, they'd a bit me.
" He hasn't been saying the same thing for 22 years?
Hi.
Well, you're in a jolly mood this morning.
Ethel, have you seen my glasses?
Well, it must be hilarious that I can't read without my glasses.
Oh, it's not that, Fred.
It's just that What a sense of humor.
I'll go break my leg and give you a real laugh.
Ah, wait a minute, Fred.
Your glasses are on top of your head.
Huh?
Well, how do you like that?
If they'd been a snake, they'd a bit me.
Lucy!
Lucy, is the coffee percolated yet?
I could have slept all day.
It's fantastic, Lucy.
Ricky and Fred are cut out of the same mold.
Yeah, and they're getting moldier all the time.
What are we going to do about them?
Them?
What about us?
We're just as bad as they are.
We've all let ourselves become four big, dull clunks.
You know, I think you're right.
Sure, I'm right.
And tonight, instead of playing canasta, we're going to sit down and figure out the quickest way to de-clunk ourselves.
Do you all realize that we're in a terrible rut?
In a rut?
What are you talking about?
The four of us have allowed ourselves to deteriorate.
Yeah.
We have become stuffy, moldy, and musty.
We are knee-deep in a pool of stagnation.
Now, what are we going to do about it?
Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm going to go and take a shower.
Never mind being funny.
Now, sit down.
We're serious.
We certainly are.
Our lives have become a stale routine.
We do the same thing in the same way.
We know each other like a book.
Well, honey, that's only normal.
After you're married for 11 years, you're supposed to know each other like a book.
It's the same after 25 years, only the cover gets more dog-eared.
Listen, the kind of routine we're in is not normal.
Now, Ethel and I went down to the library this afternoon and we found a lot of books on the subject.
And?
And the books all agree.
This one states it as well as any.
"There are times when married couples let their lives fall into set patterns.
" That's exactly what's happened to us.
Right.
"The only thing to do in a case like this "is for the marital partners to spend some time away from each other.
" What?
Please.
"Change your whole way of living.
"Take a week's vacation from marriage "and don't even see your husband or wife.
"Vacation from marriage will give you both a whole new perspective.
" So?
So Ethel and I are going to spend a week away from you and Fred.
You mean I won't see you for a whole week?
That's right.
And you won't see me for a whole week, Fred.
Well, I'll make the sacrifice.
Come on.
Are you crazy or something?
What are you going to do, leave town?
No, not necessarily.
I'll go downstairs and live with Ethel.
Fred can come up here and live with you, and we'll just lead our own lives.
We just won't see each other, that's all.
Isn't this going to be fun?
We can sleep as late as we want to go shopping, call up our old girlfriends.
Yeah, we'll be just a couple of bachelor girls.
I don't like the sound of this whole thing.
Now, wait a minute, Rick.
You don't understand.
If they're going to be bachelor girls, we're bachelor boys.
Hey, that's right.
You might have something at that in there.
Yeah.
Well, good-bye, Fred.
Good-bye, Ethel.
Good-bye, Ricky.
Good-bye.
I'll be seeing you.
Well, Lucy, what do we do tonight?
Oh, I don't care.
What do you want to do?
How about going to a movie?
Again?
We've been to five movies already this week.
Well, it's Saturday night and I don't feel like staying home.
Well, neither do I. Maybe we can call somebody.
Who?
We called up all our old girlfriends.
They're all married.
Yeah.
They'll all be with their husbands on Saturday night.
Yeah, they're all in that awful rut we used to be in.
Yeah.
They don't know what fun it is to be on their own like us.
Yippee.
Ethel Huh?
Well, nothing personal, but I'm sick of the sight of your face.
Well, you should try it from out here looking at yours.
If you think this has been any All right, all right.
Let's not fight among ourselves.
We're all we've got.
How true.
Gee, I wonder what the boys are doing tonight.
I wonder.
Ethel, let's swallow our pride and go up and admit that we miss the big dopes.
Oh, no, Lucy.
They'd never let us hear the end of it.
No?
I know what we should do.
What?
We should get all dressed up like we're going out on a mad date, and then we should go up and I should say that I want to get some of my good perfume.
Yeah, then what?
Well, then when they see us all dressed up and they think we're going out, they'll get insanely jealous and they'll demand that we go out with them.
Fred get insanely jealous?
Listen, if they're as bored as we are, we'll even look good to them.
Now, come on, let's get dressed.
Well, there's no new movies.
We've seen them all.
You know something, Fred?
I hate to admit this, but I'd like to see Lucy tonight.
I can top that.
I'd like to see Ethel.
You know, if there was only some way that we could ask them without they thinking that we really miss them.
What could that be?
Good evening.
Oh, hello.
I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I wondered if I could get some of my good perfume.
Why, sure.
Come in.
Won't you?
Come right in.
Gee, don't you look pretty.
Thank you.
You, too, Ethel.
Thank you, Frederick.
We were just talking about you.
You were?
You were?
!
Um, I hope you boys are going to have as gay an evening as we are.
Oh, yes.
We've been invited to 21 for dinner.
Oh, Ethel, 21 again?
That's what the boys said- 21.
Oh, dear.
Well, we mustn't be late.
I better get the perfume.
Pardon me, please.
You, uh you two really been living it up, huh?
Oh, yes.
We've been to 21 four times this week.
That's 84.
Well, come on, Ethel.
So long, boys.
So long.
Uh Sorry we have to rush off like this.
Ethel, promise me something, will you?
Um, let's be sensible tonight.
Let's get in before 4:00 a. m. Okay, I promise.
Okay.
Well, so long, boys.
So long, girls.
We could stay and chat for just a little while.
No.
We'll be late.
You understand how it is.
Yeah, we know how it is.
We have dates ourselves.
Don't we, Fred?
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, so long.
Well, how do you like it here at 21?
TrÃ¨s gay.
Where do you suppose the boys went?
I told you 50 times.
It's as plain as the nose on your face.
They didn't have any place to go.
They just said that because they thought we were going out.
Now, let's hear no more about it, shall we?
Okay.
You think I'm right, don't you?
I don't know.
I wish I could be sure.
I'd sleep a lot better if I knew they were safely up there worrying about us.
Come on.
Where?
We're going sneak up the back way and peek in our apartment.
Once we know the boys are there, I think we'll sleep a lot better.
Hey, Rick, why don't you come on to bed.
You go to sleep, Fred.
Don't worry about me.
I'm not.
The slap of the cards keeps me awake.
Fred, you're just as worried as I am, aren't you?
You know something, Rick?
I bet they didn't go out with anybody at all.
They're just faking.
Yeah, well, I tried to talk myself into that one too.
No, I mean it.
If they had had a date, they wouldn't have come up here and made such a big to-do about it.
Yeah.
Ethel did kind of sort of want to stick around and chat, didn't she?
You know something, I bet if we went down there right now and rang the bell, they'd answer it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
If we go down there and ring the bell they'd know that we didn't have any dates.
Let's go ring the bell and then hide around the corner.
Yeah, and if they answer, we know it's them.
Right.
Let's go.
Come on.
Oh, Ethel, I was wrong.
They're not in there.
I guess they did have dates.
Oh, where do you suppose they are?
I don't know.
Go on.
Let's go back downstairs.
Let's not go down the back way.
It's too cold.
Fine thing.
They're out someplace having the time of their lives.
How did I know they really had dates?
That's them.
It's the boys.
They're coming upstairs.
Come on, down the back way.
Oh.
It's locked.
Where do we go?
The roof.
The roof?
I just want to know who they went out with.
Yeah, so do I. Well, I'm going to find out too.
How?
Well, I'm going to stay right here and when I hear someone come in, I'll look down and see who Lucy's with.
I'm a little bit curious too.
Let's sit down here.
Come on.
We'll wait right here.
Lucy, take another look.
Darn it, the watchdogs are still there.
Oh, why don't they go on inside?
I'm getting cold.
Gee, me too.
It's pretty windy up here, isn't it?
Oh, this is ridiculous.
I'm going downstairs.
Ethel, where's your pride?
I don't know, but wherever it is, it's frozen.
Now, listen.
Just stay in here.
It isn't so windy in here.
Now, let's just wait a few more minutes.
Okay.
That's long enough.
Lucy, it's stuck.
Let me try it.
Ethel, this isn't stuck.
It's locked from the inside.
Oh, fine.
What do we do now?
Pound on it.
Pound on the door.
Ricky?
Fred?
Ricky?
Fred?
Open the door!
Oh, why don't they come up and open the door?
You'll be glad to know they finally gave up and went inside.
Fine.
What do we do now?
I don't know.
I'm getting cold.
So am I. And I'm tired too.
Ethel?
Ethel, this isn't getting us anyplace.
We got to we got to we got to be brave.
Yeah.
We've got to get hold of ourselves.
Yeah.
We got to keep a stiff upper lip.
We got to find some way to attract someone's attention down on the street.
How?
I don't know.
I know.
What?
One of us could jump off and and then a crowd would collect and then she could tell the people that I was up here.
I hope you don't think I'm a bum sport, but let's think up another way.
Oh, look.
There's a light in that apartment across the alley.
Oh, that's Mrs. Sanders.
I know her.
Mrs. Sanders!
Yoo-hoo!
Yoo-hoo!
Mrs. Sanders!
Mrs. Sanders!
She can't hear us.
The windows are closed.
We got to attract her attention.
How?
Here.
That wasn't far enough.
That was far enough.
Too bad it wasn't Mrs. Sanders' window.
Oh, darn it.
She turned off the light and went in the other room.
Oh, boy.
That was a big waste of time.
No, it wasn't.
The exercise kind of warmed me up.
Well, what do we do now?
Ethel!
What?
Our troubles are over.
Come here.
Give me a hand.
Give you a hand?
Help me move this.
Move it where?
Look out, now.
Let it fall right there.
Then what?
Right there.
Push.
Push?
Push.
Push hard.
There.
There.
Put that box over here.
Put the other one on top of it.
There!
There what?
Yeah?
We walk across there, and, and and go down the stairs in the other building.
You mean walk across the board five flights up?
Certainly.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You do it.
Listen, Ethel.
I've already done all the hard work.
I thought it up.
Now, all you have to do is just tippy-toe across the board.
Oh, no.
Listen, why don't you think of this board as a foot off the ground instead of five flights up?
Huh?
Then it will be a cinch.
If it's such a cinch, you do it.
All right.
Good girl!
Uh, come on.
Who me?
Oh, no, Lucy.
I'm afraid to do it.
There's nothing to it.
Really.
Come on.
Will you help me?
It's easy.
Yeah.
Come on.
It's safe.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't!
Don't look down!
Don't look down!
Don't look down.
Am I getting there, Lucy?
Yeah.
Am I almost there?
Yeah.
Wonder what time it is.
I wonder what year it is.
Oh!
Ethel, it's raining.
Oh, fine.
Of all the things, it has to rain too.
Oh, Lucy Look.
It isn't raining out there.
You see the pave..
?
Ricky!
How did you get up there?
Same way you did.
How did you know we were up here?
Mrs. Sanders across the street phoned.
Well, what happened to your dates?
What happened to your dates?
Never mind that.
This whole thing was your idea.
Well, it was a lousy idea.
I don't like having a vacation from marriage.
I want to be in a rut with you.
And I want to be in a rut with you.

You know, it isn't every day that Mr. and Mrs. Fred Mertz celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary.

Yeah.
Sounds longer when you say it.
Oh, honey, I meant, you know, being married to Ethel for It's different with you.

You know, I'd like to see their faces when they open the present.

In the closet?
Sure.

It's slipping!
Now, what did you do that for?
I couldn't help it, honey.
It's so heavy.
Why did you have this delivered upstairs, anyway?
Now, please, please, don't lose your temper.
We're doing it for the Mertzes.
I know we're doing it for the Mertzes.

I liked it better up there.

Why did you go so fast?

Let's turn it around here, will you?
What?
Turn it around.
Go around that way.
Be careful.
Be careful of the glass.
I'll be careful of the glass.

I guess they aren't home.
Swell.
Well, back we go.
Back we go?
Well, honey, we can't leave it sitting down here.
We got to take it  Thank you for a wonderful evening.
Hide it.
Hide it?
Open your coat.
Oh, wasn't that sweet of Miss Lewis to give us this little cake?
Happy anniversary!
Happy anniversary!
A television set!
For us?
Yes.
It was worth it.
Let's get it inside and see how it works.
Well, there you are.
Now, here's to make it dark or light.
I know.
Over here's the channel selector.
Where it's marked "channel selector.
" That's right.
Let's see what we get.
How's that?
There's a wavy line right across the middle.
Wait a minute, I got it.
Honey, that's just making it worse.
Yeah, now it's wavy all over.
Let me try it, will you, Rick?
Fred, will you, please?
You don't know anything about this set.
I can make it just as wavy as you can.
Fred, it will have to be adjusted.
Adjusted?
Yes.
What are you going to do with it?
I'll fix it.
I brought this, just in case.
I'll fix this thing right away, boy.
I got to take the plug first.
Hey, wait, Rick, look at this.
"Danger, high voltage.
Do not remove this back under any circumstances.
" Oh, that's just for people that don't know anything about these sets.
Ah, here's the trouble right here, you see?
These two wires probably came loose when we were bringing the set downstairs.
Now, you see this red one here and the blue one?
They're disconnected.
I'll put them together, see?
And put them together just like that.
That ought to do it.
Yeah?
Now we'll plug it in, and we get ourselves a real picture.
Gee, I hope so.
You wait and see.
Ricky!
Now look what you've done!
You've busted it!
What I've done?
It's the lousy wiring in this broken-down apartment.
Now just a minute, Ricky.
Everything would have been okay if you hadn't butted in and tried to fix it.
Yes!
Oh, Ethel, is that any way to talk to Ricky?
He was only trying to help.
He helped it, all right.
He ruined our TV set.
What do you mean, your TV set?
We just gave it to you.
Yeah!
Well, a couple of Indian TV givers.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
Why didn't you just give us the set and keep your grubby, Cuban paws off of it?
He can put his grubby, Cuban paws any place he wants to.
Stay out of this.
Listen, you ungrateful old goat.
That's the word, ungrateful.
Yeah.
This set is just like ours, and I fixed ours 100 times.
It is not like yours.
Yours works!
Now it's like ours.
Now, listen, you.
You're going to pay for having that set fixed, Mr. Mertz.
Oh, yeah?
You're going to pay to have our set fixed, Mr. Ricardo.
We are not.
You are too.
We are not.
You are too, or we'll sue you.
Well, we'll see who's going to sue who.
Yeah, we'll sue who's going to see Come on, Fred, let's go.
Good riddance.
Yeah.
Honey, look at our beautiful set.
Look.
Thanks for the present!
You're welcome!
Hi, honey.
Oh, hi, dear.
How did everything go today?
Oh, everything's fine.
That's good.
I spent the whole afternoon figuring our case against the Mertzes.
No kidding?
Are we going to sue them?
You're darn right we're going to sue them, unless he pays for that set.
What if he sues us first?
They wouldn't dare.
Now, I got the whole thing figured out, right here.
I'll get it.
All right.
Pardon me, is this the Lewis apartment?
Oh, no.
Mrs. Lewis lives downstairs in 1A.
Oh, uh- Say, haven't I seen you before?
You're you're Ricky Ricardo, aren't you?
Yes.
Oh, gosh, could I have your autograph?
Sure.
Would you sign it right there?
There you are, my good man.
Here's your autograph.
On second thought, maybe you better keep it.
A summons!
A summons?
"The City of New York, Mertz v. Ricardo.
" How do you like that?
They are suing us.
Okay, he asked for it.
We better get ourselves a lawyer.
Look, I told you, I got the whole thing figured out.
Who needs a lawyer?
We do.
Now, look, honey, I don't want any lawyers lousing us up.
I'm going to do it myself.
Here.
What's this?
This is your onrehearsed, espontaneous testimony.
My "onrehearsed, espontaneous" testimony.
Right.
And we don't need a lawyer?
Nope.
How about an interpreter?
Now, let's not try to be funny.
I'm trying to think.
Wait a minute.
Oh, I know, here.
You sit here on this chair.
This is the witness chair.
This is the courtroom here.
Now, let's practice.
Okay.
Now, Mrs. Ricardo, tell us in your own words what happened on the night in question.
Well, we went down to the Mertzes No, no, I mean in your own words that I wrote for you.
Oh.
Uh, "Your Honor, "my grisly little story starts when my dear, sweet husband looks adoringly at Ricky, and I went to " "Looks adoringly at Ricky"?
They are directions, like stage directions.
I put a lot of them in there.
Oh.
They help point things up.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
"When my dear, sweet husband " All right, that's long enough.
Go ahead.
" and I went to help celebrate the "of our landlords, and then good friends "Mr. And Mrs. Fred Mertz Snarls at Mertzes.
" Oh, where will they be?
They'll be right around there.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, that's enough already.
"Little did we dream then that we'd end up in court "before such a handsome "distinguished, and honorable jurist as you, Your Honor Lift skirts a little higher.
" Oh!
Really?
Go ahead.
I solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me.
You may be seated.
Proceed.
Now, uh what is your name?
You know my name.
Please tell the court your name.
Oh.
Lucy Ricardo.
Now, Mrs. Ricardo, in your own words, please tell the court what happened in the night in question.
Well, Your Honor, my grisly little story starts about three weeks ago when my dear, sweet husband and I went to help celebrate the 25th wedding anniversary of our landlords and then good friends Mr. and Mrs. Fred Mertz.
Okay, Mrs. Ricardo, please go on.
"Without knowing and in good faith " I object, Your Honor.
The witness has been rehearsed.
Objection sustained.
Proceed, young lady, but remember, you're on a witness stand.
Yes, sir.
Uh In good faith, but not knowing they were preparing to stab us in the back, we brought them, as a token of our esteem an expensive, 20-inch television set.
Little did we dream then that we would end up in court in front of such a handsome, distinguished and honorable jurist as you, Your Honor.
I object, Your Honor.
Objection overruled.
Go on, my dear.
Uh Start back with that "handsome, distinguished, and honorable jurist.
" Oh, yes.
Little did we dream then that we'd end up in court before such a handsome, distinguished and honorable jurist as you, Your Honor.
Well, Mr. Fred Mertz insisted on adjusting the set, and in spite of my husband's repeated warnings- and my husband is an electronics specialist- uh, Mr. Mertz reached in and ripped off the back of the set and suddenly, there was a big explosion- poof!
Poof.
And then Mr. Mertz suddenly went out of his head and ran amok.
And he raced upstairs to our apartment and with a fiendish gleam in his eye and flecks of foam on his lips, he went straight to our television set and kicked the glass in.
And that's what really happened.
Poor Mrs. Ricardo.
Yeah.
I rest my case, Your Honor.
Attorney for the defense, would you care to cross-examine?
No, thanks, Your Honor.
I just want to call a witness who'll tell us what really happened.
That will be for the court to decide.
That's all, Lucy.
That's all.
Oh.
Call your witness.
Mrs. Fred Mertz.
I heard him.
Raise your right hand and repeat after me: I solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me.
I solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, which is more than someone in this room did, so help me.
You may sit down.
What are you trying to do- lose the case for us?
Your name, please.
Ethel Mertz.
Tell the court, please, just exactly what happened on the night in question.
Well on the night of our wedding anniversary the Ricardos came down to our apartment and forced their company on us without being invited.
As an excuse for an anniversary present, they brought us an old, broken-down, secondhand television set.
Yes, go on.
Well, the set was playing pretty good, which is a miracle in itself, when suddenly, Mr. Ricardo, or, as he is more commonly known, SeÃ±or Know-It-All, took an axe from his pocket and started hacking it.
It wasn't long before the set exploded, and then, this Cuban maniac forced us all to go to his apartment and led us to his television set and with a look of fiendish glee, picked up my husband's foot and pushed it through the glass.
That's exactly what happened, Your Honor.
Your Honor, I object.
Order, order, order!
Order!
Really!
Well.
There would seem to be some slight discrepancy in your stories.
I think the only way we can get at the truth of this is to reenact the scene.
Bailiff, will you go into my chambers and bring out my television set?
Yes, Your Honor.
Now, then, before we reenact this, I want to warn you all that this is a court of law.
You are under oath.
And the penalty for perjury is $500 or 90 days in jail.
Ew That's right.
Bring it right through.
Now, Mrs. Ricardo, will you show me exactly how Mr. Mertz pushed your husband out of the way and ripped the back of the set off?
Well Your Honor now that I think of it, maybe it was Ricky that took off the back of the set.
Really?
Well, now that she thinks of it, yeah.
Yeah!
Now, Mrs. Mertz, I want you to go over there and show me exactly what happened.
Just where did Mr. Ricardo hit the set with the axe?
Um now that I I don't think it was exactly an axe.
It was more like a sort of a screwdriver.
And then what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
There was a couple of loose wires in the back of this television set- a red one and a blue one- and this dope tried to put them together.
Well, they're supposed to be together.
They are not supposed to be together.
Look at this set here Hey, Your Honor, they're loose here too.
They are?
The red and the blue.
Let me see.
Pardon me.
Oh, well, just putting these two wires together couldn't cause an explosion.
Maybe it couldn't, but it did.
Now, now, just a minute.
I happen to know something about television sets myself, and I know positively that this could never cause an explosion.
You must have done something else.
Did you?
Well, sir, with him yelling at me all the time Yeah, he never shut his mouth.
Quiet!
Quiet!
Now, look, all four of you.
Now, this was obviously just one of those misunderstandings among friends.
Now, I want you all to go into my chambers and talk this over and apologize to each other.
After all, good friends are worth more than the price of a television set.
Now, go on.
Take them in, Bailiff.
And when you come out I want you all to be pals again.
This way, please.
You were right, Judge.
Good friends are worth more than the price of a television set.
Yeah, Judge, we apologized all around, and everything's just dandy now.
Yes, sir.
We are going to pay for their set, and they're going to pay for our set.
Ah, that's wonderful, wonderful.
Thank you very much.
You've sure been nice.
Not at all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Judge.
Now, let this be a lesson to all of us.
We must never lose our tempers.
Good-bye.
We remember.
Thank you, Judge.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Judge.

Hi, Rick.
Oh, hiya, Fred.
Is Ethel up here?
No.
She went out with Lucy.
They went to the home show.
Oh no.
Why do they have to go and look at those model homes, stuffed with all that fancy furniture?
It'll only make them unhappy.
I know.
Last year Lucy went to the home show.
When she got home, she said all of our old furniture gave her the hives.
It was two weeks before Ethel could walk into our living room without bursting into tears.
When I told Lucy that she couldn't redecorate, she cried all night.
Well, let's face it, we're in for another session with the Sobbsy twins.
I don't know, Fred.
I got a surprise that might, uh, take their minds off of it.
Yeah?
I managed to get four seats for the new Rodgers and Hammerstein show tomorrow night.
Oh, boy!
Four of them!
Hi, honey.
Hi, Ethel.
Ugh!
It's even worse than I remembered.
Hey, hey, honey, I got a wonderful surprise for you.
Sit down, will you?
Sit down?
On that?
How could anyone possibly sit on that?
Well, honey, it's easy.
You stand up here like this, and you bend your knees, and there you are, huh?
You know what I meant.
That couch is so so Comfortable?
No, no.
It's so dirty, and the-and the springs are lumpy, and it's oh it's repulsive.
And that desk and that tired, old lamp, and that chair oh!
You think this is bad?
I have to go down and look at our apartment.
Never mind.
Never mind.
It all stays as is.
But our furniture looks crummy.
It looks crummy because it is crummy.
But it's all paid for, so forget it.
Yeah, and that goes for our stuff, too.
Ricky, you don't really expect me to live  I cannot spend one more penny  Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Ethel, what are we going through this for?
We're going to get our furniture.
Oh, yes, I forgot.
What is this?
Look out for a trick.
It's no trick.
The home show is having a big drawing and the winners are each getting five rooms of beautiful furniture absolutely free.
Yes.
Oh.
And you two put your names down?
That's right.
Yes.
Oh, well, Fred, help me get this junk out of the way before the new furniture arrives.
Excuse me.
Go ahead, make fun.
You're going to feel pretty silly when we win.
Now, look, honey, sit down, will you?
Hmm!
Force yourself.
Now, look, listen to me, will you?
Do you know how many people put their names down on a thing like that?
Yes, I do.
Do you know that your chances are one in a million?
A lot you know.
We each made out a hundred cards.
Our chances are one in 10,000.
Now, look, let's forget the whole thing, huh?
We will until they call us and tell us that we won.
All right, all right.
Now, in the meantime, I got some real good news for you.
What?
Well, I managed to get four seats for the opening of a new musical tomorrow night.
Not the Rodgers and Hammerstein show?
Right.
Oh, honey, how wonderful.
Ricky, that's wonderful!
Uh-oh.
What's the matter, Lucy?
We can't go out tomorrow night.
Why not?
What do you mean you can't go out?
They might call us from the home show.
So what?
They'll call you back.
Oh, no, they won't.
You have to be home when they call.
Now, look, honey, you know how tough it is to get seats for an opening night, and this is Rodgers and Hammerstein.
I'm sorry, dear.
It's out of the question.
I'm not leaving this house until the home show drawing is over, and that's final.
Hey, Fred.
Gee, I'm glad you stopped by.
I wanted to see you.
Hey, Rick.
What are you doing around here this early in the morning?
Well, I had a bunch of business calls to make and Lucy won't let me use the phone.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
We may as well forget about that opening night.
Well, I don't know, Fred.
I got a plan on how to get Lucy and Ethel out of the house tonight.
How?
Make them think that one of them won the prize.
What?
Well, look, we know that they haven't got a chance anyway.
So all we have to do is one of us has to get to the phone, call Lucy and tell her that she won the prize.
And then make sure that you hang up before she recognizes your voice.
Wait a minute.
Why should I be the one to call?
Well, Fred, I'd be glad to do it, I'd love to do it, but she'd recognize my accent in a minute.
You're going to use an accent?
Never mind.
Now, will you call her?
Well, okay, okay.
Well, go ahead; there's the phone.
Well, now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
I got to get up my nerve.
Oh, Hazel, give me a double-chocolate malted.
I'll see you later.
Hi.
Ethel, what are you doing away from your phone?
I'm not.
Is it connected?
Yeah.
Fred fixed it so I could go anyplace in the building.
Where did you ever get such a long cord?
Well, don't tell the phone company, but every time anybody moves out of an apartment, Fred swipes the extension cord.
Oh.
Gee, my phone hasn't rung all morning.
I wonder if there's anything wrong with it.
Oh, darn these party lines.
There's always somebody using it.
Well, tell them to get off.
Oh, you know how much good that would do me.
I've had run-ins with these characters before.
Well, it's about time she named the date.
Do you know how long she's been engaged?
Huh?
I'll believe the marriage when I see it.
Pardon me, but would you please get off the phone?
Wait a minute, Agnes.
Miss Big Ears is listening in.
I'm sorry, but the phone is in use.
But this is an emergency.
It's a matter of life and death.
Help, fire!
Help, fire!
Fire!
Help!
Ah, try something new.
Now, what were we saying, Agnes?
Oh there's no use.
I'll bet the home show's calling me right now.
Oh, dear.
Hey, I got an idea.
This worked once before.
What?
Now, be quiet.
absolutely.
What else is new, Agnes?
Oh, so many things.
Boy, have I got dirt to spill.
Go ahead.
I'm listening.
: Oops, there goes my doorbell.
I'll have to call you back.
Okay, dear, good-bye.
Okay, good-bye.
There now.
Gee, if it doesn't ring soon for one of us, I'm going to be a nervous wreck.
So am I. All this suspense is making me hungry.
Well, come on.
Let's go in the kitchen and make a sandwich.
We can hear the phone from there.
Okay.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
It's the home show.
You got my phone.
Hello?
I have not.
This is my phone.
No, that's my phone!
Ethel, that's my phone.
Hello?
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs. Ricardo.
Yes.
I did?
I didn't?
I did?
Oh oh, thank you so much.
Oh, yes, yes, I'm very thrilled.
Yes.
Good-bye.
Ethel, I won!
I won all the furniture!
Gee, that's swell.
And that's for you, you ugly, old thing.
Oh, Lucy, look what you've done.
You broke off the leg.
I don't care.
I won!
I won!
I won all that wonderful furniture.
And you know what I'm going to do now?
What?
I'm going to get rid of all this junk.
I'm going to call a secondhand man and I'm going to have him come over and I'm going to sell him everything but the lightbulbs.
Now, that glue ought to hold it.
Help me set it up.
Okay.
You ready?
Mm-hmm.
Oh boy, will I be glad to get rid of this junk.
Oh, there he is.
Hide that glue.
Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes.
I'm Dan Jenkins, secondhand furniture man.
Oh, come right in.
Is this the junk you want to sell?
Junk?
Why, this is fine furniture in excellent condition.
Yeah Yeah, sure.
Hmm.
Hmm Ah, ah oh.
Uh This is my neighbor, Mrs. Mertz.
Mr. Jenkins.
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do?
Well Y- You can see that everything's practically new.
It's hardly been used at all.
Yeah, I see.
She's right.
Many times I've been up here when nobody sat down.
Uh-huh.
You see, I wouldn't dream of selling except that someone's giving us some new furniture.
Well, uh bedroom furniture, too?
Yes, in there.
Ah.
I don't think he likes it, do you?
He just wants us to think that.
You watch- when he comes out, he's going to make me a very low offer and I'll just get him to go higher and higher.
You watch.
Mrs. Ricardo Yes?
Well, I'll take your furniture.
You will?
Yeah, and I'll give you Oh, I shouldn't go this high, but I took an immediate liking to you, so I'll give you $100.
$100?
Well, you'd better look again, Mr. Jenkins.
All right, make it $90.
Ninety?
!
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Why, this coffee table alone is worth more than that.
Seventy-five.
I'll take it.
Sign the bill of sale, please.
$5 $30, $60 $70 and $5.
Thank you.
I'll have my truck in the neighborhood this afternoon.
Can I pick up the furniture then?
Oh, well, could you check back?
I'd kind of like to have the new furniture here before you take this.
All right.
Now, you ladies sure made a sharp deal.
Getting 75 bucks out of me for all this broken-down stuff.
Ooh.
Well I'll just have to make it up on the next customer.
Afternoon, ladies.
Good-bye.
Gee, I'm sorry.
Well, it really doesn't matter, as long as I'm getting the new furniture for nothing.
Oh.
Gee, you know it's a shame to put all that new stuff in here with this old paint and paper.
You know what I'm going to do with this money?
What?
I'm going to repaint and repaper this whole dingy apartment.
Oh, Lucy, paper hangers are awful expensive.
Who needs a paper hanger?
We'll do it ourselves.
We will?
Sure.
Come on, let's go downtown and buy all the paper and stuff.
Okay, I'll get dressed.
Hurry up, now.
There.
Did you get it all?
Is this everything we need?
Yep.
Let me see it.
Let me see how it looks here.
Oh, boy!
Isn't that pretty?
Isn't it beautiful for a bedroom?
Uh-huh.
It's so dreamy.
Isn't that nice?
Well, let's get started.
By the time we get to the living room, we'll be professionals.
We got to measure it.
Now, I got to find out how much paper there is in each roll.
Okay.
Got to get- have an idea of how many we need, you know?
All right.
Okay there.
That's-that's about it now, I think.
All right.
Put it down here a minute.
Let's see now.
It's about that high.
Hold it up.
All right.
There.
Now we got to put the paste on it.
All right.
Turn it over.
Lay it down on the floor.
Oh, Lucy, it'll get dirty.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you hold it up in front of you and I'll put paste on it that way.
All right.
Now be careful.
Ready?
Yeah.
Hold on now.
All right.
Okay.
Keep it moving.
Okay.
Okay.
Keep it moving.
All right.
Keep it moving.
Oh, Lucy!
Ethel, I'm sorry.
Oh You're on the paper!
I'm sorry, Lucy, but you hit me in the face with that.
Oh, look what you did.
Well, let's straighten it out.
Wait wait Ethel, we haven't got a lot of paper.
You have to be careful.
Could we use that-that little?
Oh, Lucy.
This looks like the biggest chunk here.
Oh here.
Whoo!
Oh, we can't use this.
We'll have to cut another piece.
All right, put it over here.
Oh, that's a shame.
I got that so pretty, too.
Let's try another one, huh?
All right now.
Be careful now.
I will.
There.
Now, that's about it.
There.
Now turn it over.
Careful.
Okay.
Oh, no, that didn't work.
Put it down on the floor.
Oh, okay.
There we are.
Yep.
It'll look so pretty up there.
Oh.
Oh, Lucy.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, honey.
Now leave me alone.
Move back.
There now.
Okay.
There now.
Now we got to get it on the wall.
Where?
Right over there in the corner.
Okay, in the corner.
All right.
Listen, you'd better come up here on this side with me.
All right.
Now be careful.
All right.
Okay?
Ready.
Okay, let's go.
What's the matter with you?
You said over here in the corner.
Well, I meant in this corner!
Oh!
Now take ahold of it.
Okay.
Now, are you ready?
Now, before we start, which wall do you want it on?
That wall.
Put it in the middle- we'll have plenty of room on either side.
Okay.
Ready?
One, two, three.
Go!
How do you get the slack out?
Not very straight, is it?
No.
Well, look, we can put the rest of it on at this angle and then it'll be uniform.
You'll have to hang on the mattress to keep from falling out of bed.
Mrs. Ricardo, got my van downstairs ready to pick up my furniture.
Oh, well, uh, my new stuff hasn't arrived yet.
Oh.
Well, I'll call back in the morning, huh?
Okay.
I'll sure be glad to get rid of this old junk.
Bye.
Hi, honey.
Oh, darn.
I'd hoped that you wouldn't get home until later.
What's going on?
Well, I kind of wanted to surprise you, but I won.
The home show called, and I won all the furniture.
Oh, that's nice, yeah, but, uh, what are you doing?
Well, did you see that man that just left?
Yeah.
Well, that's Mr. Jenkins and I sold him all of our furniture for $75.
And Ethel and I are You what?
!
What?
You what?
!
I said, I sold him all the furniture.
Mr. Jenkins!
Mr. Jenkins!
Mr. Jenkins!
You calling me?
Yeah.
Please come back here, Mr. Jenkins!
Please come back!
Hurry up!
Oh, my goodness.
What's the matter, Ricky?
He gave me $75 for all the stuff.
$75 for all?
: Oh, no.
Me and my great ideas.
That wasn't the home show calling, that was Fred.
Fred?
Yeah, Fred.
Ricky, what are you saying?
Well, I thought it was a nice way to get you out of the house to go to the opening Somebody call me?
Yeah, Mr. Jenkins, come here, would you please?
I want to talk to you a minute.
Here, sit down, won't you?
This is a nice chair here.
Sit down, Mr. Jenkins.
Sit down here a minute.
Listen, Mr. Jenkins Listen there's been a terrible mistake.
It's all my stupidity.
You see, my wife didn't win the prize at all, and, you see, I thought Uh, I want to get the furniture back.
Oh, fine, that's okay by me.
Thank you.
Give me the $75, will you, honey?
What's the matter, honey?
I spent the money for the wallpaper.
Oh.
Well, I'll give you the $75.
Hey, just a minute, Mr. Ricardo.
I'll be glad to sell you this stuff, but certainly you don't expect to get three rooms full of beautiful furniture like this for a measly $75?
But that's what you paid for it!
That's true, but I'm in the business.
It isn't just the purchase price.
I got to add my overhead, electricity, rent, insurance, storage charges, advertising.
You haven't moved a stick of furniture out of this apartment.
Yeah Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Lucy, did you sign anything?
No only a bill of sale.
Only a bill of sale.
All right, Mr. Jenkins, you paid $75 for the furniture?
Now, how much all this other stuff that you mentioned?
What what does it add up to?
What?
What was?
Now remember, you haven't moved anything out of the apartment.
Oh, I'm allowing for that.
Better take another look at the furniture.
We've had it an awful long time, and the paint's all off, and it's real ugly, and it's old, and I realize how much these valuable antiques mean to you, madam.
Antiques?
Lucy, please, you said enough.
Wha All right, how much?
How much?
Well I shouldn't really do this.
I'm taking off every penny I can.
I'll let you have it all for only $500.
$500!
That's ridiculous.
I won't buy it back.
I'll get the fellas in the van Now, wait a minute.
Don't hurry up so fast.
Come back here a minute, will you?
Now, let's compromise, maybe.
How about two, uh?
$300 and, uh uh, $95?
Well, I'm a lousy businessman but, uh, I like the way you sing "Babalu," so I'll take it.
Thank you.
Mira, lo que me pasa a mi, no le pasa a nadie en este pais.
Vende el furniture for $75.
Y lo tengo que comprar ahora por $395.
Ese va ser.
Aqui esta.
Ah, you two are certainly making a sharp deal.
Well I guess I'll just have to make it up Yeah, you'll just make it up on your next customer.
I know.
Well evening.
Good-bye.
Adios.
Now, Ricky, it wasn't my fault.
I know.
I know.
It's all my fault.
It is?
Yeah.
Come on, I'll help you carry the stuff into the bedroom.
Come on.
In the bedroom?
Yeah.
Uh, well, we-we really haven't finished papering in there yet, and I, uh What?
What?
What?
What did you say?
I said, we haven't finished papering in there yet, and - Who is "we"?
- "We" is Ethel and Lucy paper hanger.
Oh, this this I got to see.
No, Ricky.
I won't get mad.
You promise?
I promise you I won't get mad.
Promise?
Yeah.
Just let me see it.
Now, come on.
You and Ethel papered the room.
Uh-huh.
Just the two of you, huh?
Uh-huh.
Ricky, what's the matter?
It makes me dizzy.
Open the window, will you?
I need some air.
Window?
Window.
Lucy, what have you done with the windows?
Now, don't worry.
It's here someplace.
There.
How can you possibly paper over a window?
!
Now, Ricky, don't bawl me out.
That's only a minor thing.
Wait till I tell Ethel I didn't win.
What's the matter?
Where is Ethel?
Where is Ethel?
Ethel?
Ethel?
Ethel?
Ethel!
What?
Ethel, the most terrible thing has happened.
Oh, Ricky!
I'm in here, Fred!
What?
What?
I was waiting for you to get home.
What happened?
Lucy sold all the furniture and papered the room, thanks to a very funny phone call.
What phone call?
Look, don't try to cover it up.
She knows all about it.
No, no, no.
That's what I was going to tell you.
I lost my nerve and I didn't make that phone call.
Then who did?
It must have been the home show!
I won!
I really won!
I won!
I really won!

Okay, Des.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
Lucy?
Yeah?
Your new furniture came.
Really?
What's it like?
I don't know, I was so busy, I just told them to put it all in the apartment.
Oh, I'm just dying to see it.
Oh, darn this key.
You know, for the rent you charge, you could have bigger keyholes.
There.
Oh, my gosh!
You know, I think there's a little too much furniture in here.
It does look a little overcrowded, doesn't it?
I forgot we had to take the old furniture out.
Oh, well Gee, there's a lot of wonderful stuff, huh?
Where's the phone?
Yeah.
It's not here.
Oh.
Well, now, where is the phone?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
What did they do with it?
Let's see now, I was lying on the sofa talking.
It's on the floor someplace.
Yeah, sounds like it, doesn't it?
Lucy!
Did you find it?
No.
Oh.
Oh, here it is, for heaven's sake.
Oh, gosh.
Hello?
Oh, too late.
Now I'll never know who it was and that drives me absolutely crazy.
Me, too.
Gee.
Hey, look at this stuff.
Isn't it going to look wonderful?
Uh-huh.
Oh, look at that luscious chair.
Oh, boy.
Oh, Ethel, will you help me get the old stuff out?
I'm dying to see how the room's gonna look.
Where will I put it?
Let's take it and put it in the hall, all the old stuff.
Okay.
Here.
Listen, you know, I'm not going to be able to leave that piano there.
I'm going to put it over on that wall.
I want everything completely different, you know?
There.
Oh, it just looks wonderful, Lucy.
Isn't it beautiful?
I'm going to make an entrance from another room and see how it looks.
Oh, this is the most beautiful room I've ever seen.
Ethel?
Yeah?
Oh  How do you like it?
Gee, this new stuff is marvelous.
Isn't it, though?
Listen, Fred, would you do me a big favor?
Would you take a few little pieces of furniture down to the basement for me?
Sure.
Where are they?
Right out here.
A few little pieces, huh?
Well, it's not very much.
If you just move this over a little bit  What's the matter?
Something moved!
Something touched me!
There's something alive in there!
Alive?
!
Yes, right there.
Oh, that's impossible.
It is not impossible.
It's me.
Fred, what's the big idea?
This is the craziest thing I've ever seen yet.
What's the idea of putting all the furniture in the?
Well?
Oh, it's real nice, honey.
You don't like it?
Oh, yes, I do, honey, I do.
It's just I don't feel good today, honey.
I feel real bad.
I got a sore throat and I I think I'm catching a cold, everything.
Oh, you've been working too hard redecorating that club.
Yeah, maybe that is.
Will you get me a couple of aspirins, honey?
Sure, dear, sure.
Ethel, do you think I make a mistake putting that chair there?
You know, my first impulse was to put the chair here, have the table on this side  Lucy, Lucy What?
Please, honey.
I don't feel good.
Get me the aspirins.
I think I'm getting a strep-te-coccy.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't know it was so serious.
Do you think you'll live till I get back from the kitchen?
Get me the aspirins, please.
Does Fred always act like a child when he gets ill?
You mean, Baby Snooks?
Oh, brother.
Very funny.
Yeah.
Boy, it has to happen now.
I got an opening coming up and everything and now I got to get a sore throat.
Oh, you'll be all right.
Well, I want to make a good impression on Mr. Chambers.
Who's Mr. Chambers?
He's the new owner of the Tropicana.
Oh.
Hey, Rick, does Lucy know that you're casting a new show?
No.
That's the good part about this furniture deal.
She's been so busy, she's not thinking about getting into the act.
Gee Fred will take your furniture down a little later, honey.
Okay.
Yeah.
Ricky and I will carry it downstairs for you.
Ricky isn't feeling well.
Oh, he doesn't feel that bad.
Do you, Rick?
Aw, come on.
You're all right.
Come on.
: Well, if you insist, I'll take it down with you, Fred.
Oh, never mind!
I'll do it myself!
Come on, Ethel!
Honey, it is not funny.
I don't feel too good.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
Here.
There.
Poor baby.
Lucy?
Lucy?
Hi.
How's Ricky this morning?
He's dying.
That's good.
I thought it might be something serious.
Yeah.
Honestly, Ethel, why are men such babies?
I wish I could get away with acting like that.
You said it.
Last week Fred had a little headache and took to his bed and moaned he might not live through the night.
Remember when I broke my ankle last year?
He tried to get me out of bed the second morning to fix his breakfast.
He said walking would help the bone heal.
Lucy Pardon me, Ethel.
I'm wanted in surgery.
I'll go scrub up in case you need me.
What is it, dear?
Oh, I-I feel worse.
My-my throat is worse.
I feel awful.
Mm-hmm.
You want to look at it, please, for me?
Yes.
Open up, dear.
What you see?
Oh  Uh?
Uh?
Uh?
Wh-Wh-What do you see?
Just as I thought.
What?
It's dark down there.
I'll have to get the flashlight.
All right.
Get a flashlight.
I don't know why this has to happen to me now.
I got the opening coming and everything.
You never put the flashlight in the same place twice.
I put it where you told me to put it the last time you said I didn't put it in the same place.
All right, now let's take a look at that throat.
All right.
Here I am, lying in a bed of pain and y-you making fun with me.
I'm sick.
All right, dear.
Open up.
Oh, boy, I wish you could see down in here.
It's so colorful.
It's like the Carlsbad Cavern.
Is it?
Is it red?
Yeah.
Red, white, blue, pink, burnt orange.
Now don't-don't make fun, will you?
I don't feel good.
Not only my throat, I mean, my I got a cold, clammy feeling in my stomach.
A cold, clammy feeling on your stomach?
Yeah, I do.
I have Oh, honey, no wonder.
That's why.
I'll probably catch pneumonia.
I'd better change the clothes.
I'll never be able to make that show.
Babalu Babalu-u-u That's pretty baba-lousy.
Never mind.
Honey, are you sure you don't feel like eating a little breakfast?
Oh, no.
No.
No?
Well, you should have some liquids.
How about a little orange juice?
All right, a little orange juice.
Okay.
And, uh maybe a little coffee.
Okay.
Uh M- maybe I could choke down one piece of toast.
Buttered.
Yeah.
I, uh I really need my strength, you know.
Maybe you should put some bacon with it?
Orange juice, toast, coffee, and bacon.
Yeah.
Coming up.
Uh, Lucy?
How do you want them- fried or scrambled?
Poached.
Hi, Lucy.
Oh, hi, kids.
How's Ricky?
Well, I called the doctor and it's a little more serious than I thought.
He has a virus that settled in his throat.
Oh, gee.
Is it bad?
Well, the doctor said if he was going to be in the show, he'd have to stay in bed a whole week and not talk.
Not talk at all?
Not a word.
Gee.
Imagine not being able to talk for seven whole days.
Why don't you hang around here?
Maybe you can catch it.
Never mind.
Let us know if there's anything we can do.
Okay.
We'll check you later.
Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye.
Ethel and Fred- they came up to see how you were.
Here's your medicine.
Doctor said you got to take your medicine.
Now, the doctor said you have to take your medicine.
Don't shout at me.
Now, when I say you got to take medicine, that means you got to take it.
Now, Ricky!
Look what you did.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Now, look, if you're gonna act like a child, I'm gonna treat you like one.
Open your mouth!
Open it up!
Never mind.
Now, is there anything else I can do for you or to you?
Oh, this is silly.
Write it.
Write it.
Write it.
No.
This is silly.
I got to go down there and stage the show.
I got to stage the show.
Ricky, stay where you are.
Let Mr. Chambers stage the show.
Well, I can't ask him to do that.
All right then, I'll ask him.
I'll call him on the phone and ask him.
No, you know, this is too important for a telephone call.
I'm going to get dressed and go down there and see him in person.
You stay in that bed.
Well Well.
Here I am, Lucy.
What'd you want?
Oh, thanks for coming up, honey.
Listen, I got to go down to the club for Ricky.
Will you stick around in case he needs anything?
Sure.
What are you going down to the club for?
I'm going to see Mr. Chambers.
You know how conscientious Ricky is.
He's going to get out of that sickbed and go down there and stage that show.
Well, I'm going to ask Mr. Chambers to stage it for himself.
Oh.
Well, good luck.
Thanks.
I'll need it.
Hello?
Hello.
May I speak to Ricky Ricardo, please?
This is Mr. Chambers calling.
Oh, Mr. Chambers, this is Mrs. Ricardo.
Ricky can't talk right now.
You see Will you give him a message for me, Mrs. Ricardo?
You tell him I've been called out of town for a few days.
I ought to be back the day before the opening.
Tell him not to worry.
I have every confidence that he'll turn out a great show.
But, Mr. Chambers Yes?
Uh have a nice trip.
Thank you thank you very much.
Bye.
Gee, Mr. Chambers is going out of town.
Oh what's Ricky going to have to say about that?
Nothing.
I'm not going to tell him.
You're not going to tell him?
Of course not.
Well, then who's going to stage the show?
Who cares?
I'm not letting Ricky out of that bed until the doctor says so if I have to stage a show myself.
You wouldn't.
Of course I wouldn't would I?
Well Oh, it's crazy.
Oh, sure, it's fantastic.
What a thought.
Of course, it would give me an opportunity to hire some talent that has been grossly overlooked in the past.
You mean Fred and I could do one of our dance routines?
Right after my opening number.
Oh!
That is, if you're as good as you say you are.
What do you mean?
You may audition for me the first thing in the morning.
Oh, good!
I'll go tell Fred.
Yes.
Yes, I understand, Doctor.
Well, I'm glad that you agree.
Yes, well Lucy Oh, well, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Good-bye, Doctor.
Fred will be up just a minute.
He's got the act and the music and everything.
Good.
I just talked the doctor into making Ricky stay in bed until opening night.
That'll get him out of the way.
He's not even going to get to come to one rehearsal.
Ricky still thinks that Mr. Chambers is staging the show?
Sure!
And Mr. Chambers still thinks Ricky's staging the show.
That's right.
Uh-oh.
Now don't worry about Mr. Chambers.
I think we can handle him.
I hear he's an ex-vaudevillian.
Oh, good.
Hi, kids.
I got it.
It was in the trunk- the whole act: Words, music, orchestrations, gags, routines, everything!
You're sure this is good, now?
It was a smash when Ethel and I did it at the palace.
At the palace?
!
You're darn tootin'.
That was the best theater in Jamestown, New York.
"Flapper Follies of 1927".
Yeah.
You don't think maybe this might be a little out of date, do you?
Oh, no!
That's what's wonderful about it.
They're reviving everything we did in that show- ukuleles, the Charleston, even the fashions.
Gee, that's right.
And I wish you could've seen those showgirls.
Oh, That was the most beautiful line of showgirls I ever saw.
Really?
And here's another break we get- I called them up, and every one of them was still available!
Oh!
Well, that's just wonderful.
We got an awful lot of work to do before next Saturday.
Oh!
And I wish you could see the way Ricky has redecorated the club for the opening.
It is the most beautiful thing you've ever seen.
Listen, now you take this to Marco.
Tell him to get the musicians ready.
We got to talk about costumes.
Wait till you see a blue dress I found in the trunk that I used to wear in the act     There is sweetness in the call of a woodland dove As her love song echoes through the trees There is sweetness in a rose with its symbol of love Floating on a summer breeze But nothing can compare with the sweetness of The one and only one I love Yeah!
Sweet And lovely Sweeter than the roses in May And she loves me Heaven must have sent her my way I'm an angel!
Skies above me Never were as blue as her eyes And she loves me Who would want a sweeter surprise?
Surprise!
Surprise!
Surprise!
When she nestles in my arms so tenderly There's a thrill that words cannot express In my heart, a song of love is taunting me Melody Taunting me  Sweet and lovely Sweeter than the roses in May And she loves me  Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi.
There is nothing more I can say.
Maestro, maestro, please wave your baton and see the great dance team that you will bring on.
Oh, boy!
Nothin' could be finer : Ooh  Than to be in Carolina In the mornin' No one could be sweeter than my sweetie When I meet her In the mornin' When the morning glories wind around my door While they're whispering pretty little stories That I love to hear once more Strollin' with my girlie when the dew is pearly Kinda early in the mo-or-ornin' Butterflies all flutter up to kiss each little buttercup At da-a-awnin' If I had Aladdin's lamp For only a day I could make a wish, and here's what I'd say Oh, nothin' could be finer Than to be in Carolina Yes, with you in Carolina In the mo-or-ornin'.
We'd like to have you meet a little bit of heaven- the queen of all the flappers of 1952.
Of 1927.
'52.
Oh, she is Five-foot-two, eyes of blue No one knows what she can do Has anybody seen my gal?
Turned-up nose, rolled-down hose A flapper, yes, sir, one of "those" Has anybody seen my gal?
So if you bump into five-foot-two Covered with furs Diamond rings and all those things Bet your life, it isn't her Could she lie, would she woo?
Would she, could she koochie-coo?
Has anybody seen that Anybody seen that Anybody seen that  I mean, my baby Has anybody seen My gal?

There's a brand-new baby at our house The nicest little gift we've ever had How much fuller life's become No one knows what makes it hum Till you call each other Mommy and Dad There's a brand-new baby at our house And though he's been there just a little while In the parlor, in the hall Every picture on the wall Seems to know because they all wear a smile I can't explain what he does to my heart With his infant charms I never knew what heaven was Till I held an angel in my arms There's a brand-new baby at our house He's twice as sweet as honey from the comb He's the image of my spouse, he's the tricky Mickey Mouse Who has changed our happy house to a home We thank the Lord Whose love and wondrous powers Gave us that brand-new Grand-new Baby of ours.
Oh, Ricky, that was wonderful.
That's great.
Rick, did you really write that song?
Yeah.
I wrote it for Lucy.
I'm going to take it down to the hospital and play it for her.
See, I was recording it while I was singing it.
Oh, isn't that clever?
Where did you get this thing?
Well, Lucy bought it to record the baby's first words.
How could she buy it if she's in the hospital?
Well, the lady in the next bed is a salesman for the tape recorder company.
What?
Yeah, no kidding.
This lady has a baby every year and she sells enough recorders to pay for the baby.
And you know how Lucy is.
We certainly do.
Remember that Handy Dandy Company?
Ay-yi-yi.
Oh, gee, I'll never forget the expression on Lucy's face that morning when I brought the mail up to her.
Good morning, Lucy.
Hi.
What's the matter with you?
Oh, it's that Cuban sorehead I'm married to.
I just had my weekly lecture about spending too much money.
What'd he have to say this time?
I couldn't understand most of it.
All I could get was that pesos don't grow on trees.
Well, it's over for another week.
I brought up your mail.
Good.
What's this?
Oh, no.
Oh, I don't want Ricky to know that I bought this.
This is a kitchen gadget that I saw demonstrated on television.
Where can I hide it?
How about the refrigerator?
That's a good idea.
He'd never look in there.
He'll never think of looking in here in a million years.
: No, I guess not.
There, you think that's safe?
Yeah, I think it's safe.
Ricky!
What's in the package you don't want me to see?
Nothing.
Let me see the package.
Nothing.
Statue-of-liberty play, Ethel.
Okay.
Throw it here, Ethel!
Now, Ricky, give me that thing.
That's mine, Ricky.
Now, wait a minute.
Let me see.
Let's see what's in the package.
What is it?
It's a Handy Dandy kitchen helper.
I saw it demonstrated on television.
It's a tremendous bargain when you think of all the things you can do with it.
How much is it?
Uh, it rices, dices, and splices.
Lucy, how much?
It cuts down on the time that a housewife has to spend in the kitchen.
How much?
About two hours a day.
Lucy $7.98.
$7.98!
Yeah, but you'd think it was cheap at twice the price if you saw all the things the man does with it on television.
I watch him every day.
Here, I'll show you.
Ethel?
Yeah.
You'd better come down and let me see what you want me to do with that clothesline.
Just a minute.
Come on in.
Lucy's going to give us a demonstration.
Of what?
A woman's stupidity.
That shouldn't take very long.
All right, now you all stand over there.
Now, ladies and gentlemen I am about to demonstrate the Handy Dandy kitchen helper.
It's something you shouldn't be without.
It peels and splices, cuts and rices skins and dices at lowest prices.
Now watch me closely, ladies and gentlemen.
I will set the dial for French fries, and then by turning this handle, I will cut this potato into 16 identical slices.
Here we go.
Oh, I must have had it set for baked potato.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't have it right on French fries.
That was it.
Here we go.
It looked so easy when the man did it on television.
Oh, honey, maybe you just haven't got the hang of it yet.
Well, I did what they told me.
Honestly, Fred, why is it that women have no sales resistance whatsoever?
I don't know.
They'll buy anything.
Lucy doesn't know the meaning of the word "no.
" Ethel doesn't either.
Lucy is a sucker for any sales pitch.
Ethel is too.
Lucy and Ethel make me sick.
Now, honey, you, you must admit that you'll buy anything that comes along.
I'm no worse than you are.
How about that little purchase you made at the war surplus store?
That was a necessary item.
Oh, sure.
You never know when you're going to use a 20-foot rubber life raft.
What are you laughing at, fatso?
You're just as bad.
What are you talking about?
Now, look, look, look.
The fact is that you've just thrown eight dollars down the drain for this.
$7.95, and it isn't down the drain.
I got it on a three-day free trial.
If I don't want it, I just call them up and tell them to take it back.
Well, then call them up.
No.
Lucy, either you're going to call them up and tell them to take it back, or I'm going to use it to demonstrate how to cut a wife into 16 identical slices.
Really?
Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes?
I'm Harry Martin of the Handy Dandy Company.
Oh, yes, I've been expecting you.
Won't you come in, please?
Mr. Martin, this Handy Dandy kitchen helper does not work and I have it on a three-day free trial and I don't want it.
You'll have to take it back.
Gladly.
It isn't any good, and I'm not going to pay for it.
Of course you're not.
I see no reason why I should What'd you say?
I said of course you're not going to pay for it.
We don't want you to keep any merchandise that you're not happy with.
You don't?
No, of course not, and you're quite right not to want that.
Why, that isn't a wise buy at all.
In fact, Mrs. Ricardo, I wouldn't let you keep this dreadful little gadget even if you begged me to.
I'm glad you didn't want that.
That shows me that you're a woman of judgment and taste.
Really?
Yes, indeed.
When you opened that door, I said to myself, I said, "Harry, there stands a woman of judgment and taste.
" Is that so?
Mm-hmm.
Mrs. Ricardo, you have no idea of the inferior type of humanity that I have to contend with in my profession.
Why, you just wouldn't believe some of the women that I have to talk to.
They they have no intelligence at all.
My goodness.
Mm-hmm.
Why, just this morning, I ran in Say, I'll bet I'm keeping you from something important.
Oh, no, no.
Not at all.
Well, I find you're such an easy person to talk to and, I don't know, I'd just like to get this off my chest.
Oh, well, go right ahead.
May I tell you about what happened to me this morning?
Certainly.
Thank you, thank you.
Now, you just pretend that you're this woman I'm calling on, eh?
All right.
Just stay right there.
What's that?
I also represent the Handy Dandy vacuum cleaner.
Oh.
So this morning when the woman opened the door and I threw the dirt on the floor, just like I did now and then I handed her a ten-dollar bill, just like this, you see, and then I said to her I said, "Madam, that ten-dollar bill, "that sawbuck, that one-tenth of a C- note "is all yours if this Handy Dandy vacuum cleaner "fails to clean up all this dirt in less than two minutes flat.
" I said that to her, see?
And then I, uh I took my Handy Dandy vacuum cleaner and I I plugged it in like this, and then I went right to work.
That's funny.
Oh, this plug is controlled by this switch.
So's that light, see?
Oh, I see.
Go.
My!
That was fast.
Yes, it was, wasn't it?
But do you know that woman was angry with me?
About what?
Because I threw dirt on her floor.
But you cleaned it right up with your wonderful Handy Dandy vacuum cleaner.
Yes, yes, of course I did, but she was still angry and do you know what she did next?
What?
Why, when I told her that this Handy Dandy vacuum cleaner and the attachments that it sold for $8.95 for the works, why, that shortsighted, narrow-vision female did not even have the intelligence to buy one.
What a dope.
Well, it shows you what you've got to put up with.
I'm glad you let me get that off my chest.
Mr. Martin did you say, uh, 8.95?
That's right.
And, uh, now I think I'll have to go Mr. Martin, aren't you going to give me a chance to buy one of those?
Oh, Mrs. Ricardo, when I told you about this other woman, I didn't mean to get you to buy Oh, but Mr. Martin, our sweeper is so outdated.
It's old, it doesn't work right or anything and we really do need one of those.
Well, as a matter of fact, I I was bringing this little gem home as a present for my wife, but Oh Well, I don't know.
I suppose if you really need one.
Oh, we do, we do.
You talked me into it.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Martin.
Thank you.
Uh five, six, seven, eight Mm-hmm.
Let's see 95.
Is that right?
That's the price for the works.
Now that you own the works don't you think that you would like this nice gray metal cover to keep it from getting dirty?
But didn't I just buy the?
You bought the most important part- yeah, the the works.
Now, there are a few more little accessories, like, like the hose, and the electric cord and the attachments there.
Gee, that must run into quite a bit of money.
No, no, no, not at all.
This, this electric cord, for instance, is only five dollars.
Five dollars?
!
Well, it's extra long.
Oh.
And, uh the attachments, uh are $2.50.
$2.50?
Apiece.
Oh.
And then there's a utility lamp Oh?
there's a carrying case for the cleaner Oh?
carrying case for the attachments Oh?
there's a switch that turns it on and off Hi, Lucy.
Did the man take back the kitchen helper?
Did you have any trouble with him?
What's the matter with?
Lucy, did you buy all this stuff from him?
Oh, Lucy, I thought you were going to have sales resistance from now on.
What happened?
I don't know.
Right after he took back the kitchen helper, everything went black.
Oh?
When the lights came on again, I was short $102.40.
$102.40 for just this?
No.
For a bonus, he threw in the kitchen helper.
That was nice of him.
For a dollar and a half.
What a salesman he must be!
Yeah, but this is really a wonderful machine and it just works beautifully.
Turn on the switch and I'll show you.
Okay.
What's this one for, Lucy?
Lucy?
Try this one, Lucy.
Ay, yi, yi, yi That's Ricky!
That's Ricky!
I don't want him to see this stuff.
Help me hide it.
Hide it?
Yeah.
Oh.
He can't see this.
Aren't you going to tell him you bought all this?
Someday, yes, when we're old and grey, but not now.
Where will I put it?
In the closet.
In the closet?
Ay, yi, yi, yi Canta y no llores Porque cantando se alegran, cielito lin Hello.
Oh, look.
Here's Ricky.
Hi, Ricky.
Hello, Ricky.
Good-bye, Ricky.
Well, she's in a hurry.
Yeah.
Oh, I'll hang it up for you, dear.
Oh, thank you.
What did you do today?
Why do you ask that?
I always ask that.
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
Uh, nothing much.
It's dark in here.
Oh  What's that?
What's what?
That.
What?
That.
Oh, that.
That's me.
What?
!
My stomach's growling.
It's been growling all day.
Now, Lucy, you know darn well you're not making that noise.
It sounds like a vacuum cleaner.
Where's it coming from?
Oh, that sound.
Oh, Ethel must be cleaning her rugs.
All right, Ethel, break it up down there!
That's all.
There.
I guess she's finished.
Whoops.
Not quite.
Ricky?
What?
Kiss me?
After I see what's at the end of this cord.
All right?
You'd better kiss me now if you're ever going to.
Lucy, what is this?
Oh, darn.
You found your Christmas present.
"The Handy Dandy vacuum cle " Oh, no.
Lucy, you didn't!
Yeah, I sort of did, I guess.
Okay, come on.
Call the man.
Tell him to take it back.
No.
Come on.
You'll be sorry.
Why?
'Cause he'll probably sell me a Handy Dandy bulldozer.
Never mind.
But Ricky, Ricky, really, he does sell other things, and you know how I am.
Yes.
I know only too well.
Now, look, you're going to call him back and you're going to get rid of that vacuum cleaner and you're going to get your money back, understand?
Oh, yes.
Lucy?
I'm taking it back this afternoon!
Oh I thought you were Ricky.
Oh.
Are you really going to take it back?
Yeah.
I was just having one last sweep for the road.
Oh, gee, Ethel, I don't dare call Mr. Martin.
I'm absolute putty in his hands.
Obviously.
Why did I buy that thing anyway?
Why did you?
I couldn't resist it.
Hey if I couldn't resist it maybe someone else won't be able to.
You mean you're going try to sell it to somebody else?
Sure, I could sell it.
I remember everything Mr. Martin said and did.
Don't look at me.
Oh, I'm going to start on the next block and I'm going to keep going until I unload this monster.
Good afternoon, madam.
Are you the lady of the house?
Yeah.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Madam, that ten-dollar bill, that sawbuck, that one-tenth of a C-note is all yours if my Handy Dandy vacuum cleaner fails to clean up that mess in two minutes flat.
You mean this ten dollars is mine if you don't pick up all that dirt in two minutes flat?
That's right.
Let's see, now.
Here we are.
That's funny.
I can't imagine why it doesn't work.
I can.
The electricity is turned off.
What?
We didn't pay our bill.
Oh, no.
Why didn't you tell me?
You didn't ask me.
Oh, dear.
I'm sorry I made such a mess on your floor.
I don't know how you're going to clean it up.
I do.
Ew Where can she be, Ethel?
It's so late.
I don't know.
Maybe she had to call on more houses than she thought she would.
Well, there's nothing to worry about.
She's prob Shh!
I hear somebody.
Lucy!
What happened?
You'll be glad to know, Ricky, that there are plenty of women in town with sales resistance.
Couldn't you sell the vacuum cleaner?
Oh, you poor little thing.
Come on, honey, and sit down.
Here.
Sit there.
I'll take your shoes off.
That will help.
Lucy, where's your other shoe?
Stuck in the door at 310 East 69th Street.
Oh, dear.
I was kicked downstairs, bitten by a dog and chased three blocks by a policeman that wanted to see my peddler's license.
One more hour, they'd have reported the death of another salesman.
Now, honey, I'm sorry that you had to go through all of that but you know it's your own fault.
Why didn't you call Mr. Martin like I told you to do?
Oh, sure.
Well, I'll call him.
What's his number?
It's right there on the pad.
Okay.
Oh, Fred, I don't know what these women would do without us men getting them out of all these messes that they get into.
I don't either.
Hello, Mr. Martin.
This is Ricky Ricardo.
Look.
You sold my wife a vacuum cleaner yesterday.
Yes.
That's right.
Well, uh, we decided not to keep it after all.
So we'd like you to come back tonight and take it back.
Thank you very much.
Good-bye.
There.
You see how simple it was?
Ricky, you shouldn't have him come over here.
You don't know what he's like.
He'll say that he'll take it back, but he'll sell you something else.
Oh, nonsense.
Well, I'm not going to be here.
I'm going to a movie.
Come on, Ethel, let's get out of here.
Okay.
I'm going to get cleaned up.
Have you ever seen anything like that?
Never in my life.
You take my advice.
You put that vacuum cleaner out in the hall, lock the door and sit here in the dark.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
How was the movie?
Fine.
Did, uh Mr. Martin get here?
Yeah.
He was here.
Did he take back the vacuum cleaner?
Of course he did.
He had no trouble at all.
Oh?
As a matter of fact, he paid me a great compliment.
He said I was a man of great judgment and real taste.
: Oh.
And not only that, but he said he didn't blame me in the least for not buying such an inferior product.
Uh-oh.
What happened then?
Nothing.
Come on.
Nothing.
Come on.
Where is it?
Ethel, guess what?
We have a new Handy Dandy refrigerator.
Oh, Ricky, I'm glad you don't have any sales resistance either.
Aw, Lucy.
You get all the breaks.
Nobody could sell ol' Fred anything.
Oh, no?
Oh?

Come on down and see your Handy Dandy washing machine.

Hi, Rick.
Oh, hiya, Fred.
What's all this stuff?
Well, it's some presents I bought for Lucy.
I'm going to take them down to the hospital this afternoon.
Oh.
See, that's a box of her favorite candy, her favorite perfume and how do you like this, huh?
Oh, pretty fancy.
Yeah, I want her to feel that she's getting a lot of attention.
Hey, tell me something.
If you just had a baby, you think this would do the trick?
Well, if I just had a baby, I'd be getting plenty of attention.
I mean if you were a woman.
Oh, if I were a woman.
Oh, I guess so.
Let's see.
You think it clashes with my hair?
Oh, nurse.
Hi, Ricky.
Is Fred?
Oh, there you are, nurse.
Tell me, do you think they'll operate?
Yes- on your brain, from the look of things.
What are you doing?
He's modeling Lucy's new bed jacket.
Give me that.
Oh.
Are all these things for Lucy?
Yes.
I'm going to take it down to the hospital this afternoon.
She feels kind of depressed.
Depressed?
Why?
Well, last week, one of the women had triplets, and this week, another lady had twins, so Lucy feels that she's shortchanged me.
Listen, don't laugh.
That's the kind of stuff that gave her an inferiority complex before.
Oh, yeah.
We don't want that to happen again.
I should say not.
Do you remember how that started?
No warning.
Out of the blue she had a full-fledged complex.
We were just sitting around telling each other stories That was wonderful.
I loved it.
Listen, listen, did you hear the story about that fellow that used to take his dog to the movie with him all the time?
No.
No.
Well, this fellow used to take the dog to the movie with him all the time, and they sit together, and the dog sit there and he laughs at the all jokes and he applauds and everything.
So, the manager of the theater saw this.
He walks down to this guy and says, "Do you mind telling me something?
Does this dog actually enjoy the picture"?
And the guy says, "Yeah.
I can't understand it, either.
He hated the book.
"  The dog read the book.
I got it, I got it.
Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful.
Want some candy, dear?
Candy, Fred?
No, thanks.
He's on a diet.
Since when?
Since now.
Oh.
Hey, talking about diets, Did you hear the one about the fat fella that wandered into the ladies' Turkish bath by mistake Fred, is this a story for mixed company?
Of course not.
And he asks about the fat fella that walked into Fred.
Ethel, this company isn't mixed.
It's married.
I don't care.
It doesn't sound like the kind of story he should tell when there are ladies present.
It isn't.
It's about the fat guy that str Fred All right, I won't tell it.
Oh, darn.
That's one story I hadn't heard.
Oh, well, don't be too unhappy.
Ricky.
I know a joke.
You?
Yeah, and it's fit for mixed company, too.
Well, tell it anyway.
Well, it seems that this woman walked into a restaurant Or no, wait a minute.
Was it a woman that walked into a restaurant, or was it a man?
Does it make any difference to the story?
No.
Well, it made a difference in my story.
Okay, Fred.
Aw, we'll say it was a woman.
This woman walked into the restaurant, and, uh And-and-and or was it a cafeteria?
Honey, it doesn't matter.
Get on with the story.
Oh, we'll say it was a restaurant.
This woman walked in to the restaurant and sat down.
Or did she stand up?
Well, she could Fred, you're mixing me all up.
Let her finish.
Um this woman walked into a restaurant and sat down and she ordered a steak from the waiter.
And she said No, honey, no, no.
I know that story, and it wasn't a steak.
It wasn't?
No.
Oh, it was roast beef!
No, no, honey.
What was it?
Pork chops.
Oh, yes.
Pork chops.
And she said, "I'd like two pork chops.
" Oh Go on, honey, go on.
Well, now that I think of it, this story isn't very funny.
Well, it's a scream so far.
Oh, keep quiet, Fred.
Go on, honey.
You really want to hear it?
Of course we do.
Sure, sure, go on.
I just can't wait till you get to the punch line.
The punch line?
The finish, honey, the finish.
It has a finish, hasn't it?
Well, I think so.
I just can't remember how it goes.
Oh Oh, I remember!
I remember.
The woman walked into a restaurant and sat down, and she said to the waiter, "I'd like two pork chops, please.
" And the waiter said, "Yes, ma'am.
" And she said, "And not too much fat, either.
" And the waiter said, "Yes, ma'am.
Which way"?
Well?
Is that all there is to it?
Yeah.
Pretty funny, huh?
Huh?
No?
I don't get it.
Oh, Ethel, you have no sense of humor.
She has, too.
You told it wrong.
The woman said to the waiter, "Two pork chops, and make them lean.
" And the waiter said, "Yes, ma'am.
Which way"?
Oh.
Well, isn't that what I said?
No.
Well, either way, it's hardly a belly laugh.
Oh, yeah, make them lean.
I forgot that little part.
Little part?
Oh, Lucy, you haven't told a story right for your whole life.
Well!
I'm sorry I'm not Milton Berle.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean it that way.
You don't have to get your feelings hurt.
No, I've known worse storytellers than you.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, Fred, you and Ricky quit picking on Lucy.
After all, she can't help it if she's a lousy joke teller.
Well, I can't thank you all enough.
You can just sit here and tell yourselves hilarious jokes.
I'm going to bed.
Oh, now, honey, wait a minute.
Honey!
You don't have to cry about it.
Uh, no.
Who cares about telling stories?
Let's all play bridge, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
That's a good Huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We haven't played bridge in a long time.
Yeah, that's a wonderful idea, isn't it, Lucy?
Lucy?
Well Oh, good, come on.
Let's get it set up.
All right.
That's a girl.
Here we go.
Come on, now.
I got the table.
Can I help you with that, Rick?
Yeah, it's a new one, see?
Oh!
Oh, look at that.
Well, you don't need any help.
Oh, boy!
There you go.
Rick, you sit over there.
I'd like to have Ethel as my partner for a change tonight.
No, Ethel is always my partner.
Yeah.
Why does she always have to be your partner, Fred?
Well, I'll flip you to see who gets her.
All right.
That won't be necessary.
It's pretty obvious that no one wants me for a partner.
Now, honey, wait a minute.
Where are you going?
I'm going in the bedroom and tell myself funny stories and play solitaire.
Morning, honey.
Good morning, dear.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Ricky, I've been thinking about last night.
Yes, honey?
And you know something?
I'm not very bright.
I- I don't do things well.
Well, honey, that's not true.
You're the most wonderful, the cleverest and the most fascinating woman I've ever met.
And I love you very much.
Really?
Of course I do.
Here's to the greatest little wife in the whole world.
Oh  What's the matter, dear?
What's wrong with the orange juice?
It's full of seeds.
Oh, I forgot to strain it.
I'm sorry.
Oh, that's all right, honey.
Oh Oh, boy, these eggs look great.
Mm!
What's the matter?
Nothing nothing, dear, nothing.
Oh, I salted them twice.
I know I did.
I couldn't remember and I did it again.
Oh, what's the matter with me?
Oh, honey, they're fine.
It's just, well, you know, I don't have a taste for eggs this morning.
I tell you what- I'll have some toast and coffee.
Toast!
Honey, why didn't you use the toaster?
Well, it's being fixed.
I accidentally knocked it off the counter and broke it.
Oh.
This will be all right.
I'm just scraping off the burnt part.
Sure, honey, sure.
There.
Oh, well, that's, that's all right, honey.
I'll eat something downtown.
Good-bye.
Lucy, what's the matter, honey?
I've done it again.
Chalk up another boo-boo.
Now, honey.
We might as well face it, Ricky.
I'm a big, fat flop.
Well, you are not.
I am, too.
I can't tell jokes.
I can't play bridge.
I can't get breakfast.
I can't do anything.
Oh, now, sweetheart, that's not true.
You can do a lot of things.
Name one.
Well, honey, you are very good at, uh Well, you're wonderful at, uh  Now, what are you crying about?
I can't think of anything either.
Now, honey, you stop talking that way.
You're getting an inferiority complex.
No, I'm not.
Well, it sounds like it.
No, I'm not.
I don't need a complex.
I really am inferior.
Oh, honey.
Lucy?
Hi, Ethel.
Hey, why are you in bed in the middle of the day?
Why not?
Lucy, what's the matter with you?
Ethel, I'm no good.
I'm a failure.
Now, whatever made you say a thing like that?
You all told me so last night, and you were right.
Oh, we didn't mean it that way.
Why, you're a very clever person.
You can do a lot of things.
Such as?
Well, you're just wonderful at Um Well, you've always been tops, uh Those are the same ones Ricky thought of.
Oh, now, wait a minute.
I know one thing you do better than anybody in the whole world.
What?
There's nobody can get her hair the color you can.
Thank you.
That didn't come out the way I wanted it to.
Neither did my hair.
Oh, come on.
Get out of that bed and get dressed.
No.
Lucy, come on and get up.
This isn't getting you anywhere.
Ethel, I've been where I'm going.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi.
Lucy, are you still in bed?
Hi, Ricky.
I thought we settled this on the phone.
I thought you were going to get up.
Well, I was going to, and then I asked myself why.
There I had me.
Now, come on, honey.
Come on.
How about a kiss, huh?
No.
Why not?
You wouldn't like it.
Well, honey, you you rest for a little bit and I'll come back and see you later.
Good-bye.
I'm worried about her.
I'm very worried about her.
She's got the worst inferiority complex I ever saw, the poor little thing.
I know.
I'm going to call a physio-chiatrist.
A what?
A physio-chiatrist.
A head doctor.
She's really sick.
Physio-chiatrist.
"F".
Doctor, she's just given up altogether.
She won't even get out of bed.
She doesn't think that she can do anything at all.
I see.
Well, it's just too bad that all those events happened together the other night and made her feel rejected.
I'll tell you what I want you to do.
Pay a lot of attention to her, flatter her Bring her flowers and candy.
Yeah, I tried that.
Last night I brought her a big, beautiful bouquet of flowers and a big box of candy.
What did she say?
She said, "Now what have you done"?
And she has decided that I'm in love with somebody else.
And the worst part of it is, she doesn't blame me.
Well, I don't suppose she'll believe she's attractive unless the attention comes from some outside source.
Can you think of a tall, handsome, charming man who might be willing to play along?
No.
What about this Fred Mertz you spoke of?
Oh, no.
Tall, handsome, charming man No, I can't think of anyone like that, doc.
What am I going to do?
Well, don't worry about it.
I'll find someone for you.
At, uh, 8:00 tonight, a tall, handsome, charming man will appear at your apartment.
You introduce him as an old friend.
Call him Chuck Stewart.
Oh, gee, that's wonderful, doc.
Thank you very much.
It's all right.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Right.
Why did you have me get my hair all fixed up and sit out here tonight?
Well, honey, I told you, a friend of mine, an old friend of mine, Chuck Stewart, is in town, see, and I asked him to come over tonight.
I want him to meet you.
Why?
Is he a talent scout for a freak show?
Oh, now, Lucy  Hey, that must be him now.
Chuck Stew Hi, Ricky.
Hello, Chuck.
Come on in.
Uh, Chuck I want you to meet No.
This isn't your wife?
Pretty awful, isn't it?
Oh, Ricky, you told me she was pretty, but I never expected to see such a living doll!
Eh sit down.
Won't you sit down, please?
Oh, Ricky, you always got the breaks, but how you managed to marry this gorgeous dream, I What eyes what lips what hair.
Oh, but I just met you.
I shouldn't be saying these things to you, should I?
No, but don't let that stop you.
You know, when Ricky asked me to come over this evening, I never expected to meet anything like you.
Oh?
Uh, uh Chuck, uh how's the band business been to you?
Fine.
You heard anything from the gang yet?
Nope.
Oh, I can't believe those heavenly blue eyes.
What do you say we all watch the television?
I'm not going to take my eyes off this gorgeous creature.
Uh, let's listen to the radio.
Ah, that music makes me feel like dancing, huh?
Yeah.
it makes me feel like dancing, too.
Oh, you two go ahead.
I'll watch.
Aw, come on, Mrs. Ricardo.
Now, just a minute, Chuck.
Ricky, this is part of the treatment.
What?
Oh, that's musician talk.
I asked Ricky if he knew what this part of the beat meant.
Oh.
Let's keep things moving there.
Am I holding you too tight?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Treatment, Ricky, treatment.
Eh I'm tired of dancing.
Let's sit this one out, huh?
The music has stopped!
Oh, I know I shouldn't say this to you, but you're glorious.
Oh You're ravishing.
Oh You're breathtaking!
Ooh Now, you cut that out.
Treatment, Ricky, treatment.
What do you know about treatment?
Nothing, but every time he says it, you let him alone.
Well, the treatment is all over with, doctor.
What?
He's not an old friend of mine.
He's a physio-chiatrist.
What?
I hired him to snap you out of your inferiority complex, but I don't like the way he operates.
Oh, now, Ricky, you don't understand Good night, doctor.
Come on.
Will you let me explain, Mr. Ricardo?
I understand.
Don't worry.
You're highly nervous.
Never mind that stuff.
You'll get my bill in the morning.
Yeah.
Good-bye.
Ay-ay.
Hey, um, I'm sorry I had to fool you like that, honey, but, well, the main thing is that you're okay again.
You are okay, aren't you?
Lucy?
Honey  Come on in.
What's the matter?
What'd you want us to come on up for?
Oh, I'm telling you, I made a terrible mistake with that doctor last night.
She's even worse today.
Worse?
Yeah.
She hasn't talked all day.
Oh, no.
So, listen, I thought of an idea that can snap her out of it, you know?
You know, we actually were responsible for making her get this inferiority complex- telling her that she couldn't tell jokes, that she couldn't play bridge, you know?
I guess you're right.
So, I figure that if we tell her just the opposite, we can cure her.
You mean laugh like mad if she tells a joke and fight over who's going to play bridge with her?
Yeah.
Isn't there some less painful method?
Come on.
Oh, come on, now, Fred.
This is important.
Yeah, this has got to work.
Come on, will you.
Lucy?
Honey, come on out.
We got company!
Now, lay it on real thick, will you?
You can count on us.
Oh Fred and Ethel.
I guess you came up to see Ricky, huh?
I'll go back in the bedroom and sit in the dark.
Oh, no.
Honey, the Mertzes came up to see you.
Of course we did!
Oh?
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on, sit down.
Sit down, kids.
Come on.
How are you feeling, Lucy?
Eh.
Well, you're beginning to look like your old self again.
That's an awful thing to say to anybody.
Now, Lucy, don't go.
If you leave, Ethel and I might as well go back home.
We came up to see you especially.
Oh?
Yes, we did.
We were sitting downstairs after supper and I said to Fred, "Fred, who do you think I want to see tonight more than anybody else in the world"?
And Fred said "Who"?
and I said, "Lucy Ricardo, that's who.
"Lucy Ricardo, the greatest little person in the whole wide world.
" And what did he say?
"And what did he say"?
Isn't she a scream?
That's a killer.
Did I make a funny?
Did she make a funny?
Lucy, have you heard any good jokes lately?
Jokes?
Oh, you know I don't tell jokes very well, Ethel.
Oh, honey, what are you talking about?
You're the greatest little storyteller in the whole world.
Since when?
Well, you've always told stories better than anybody I know.
Really?
Sure!
Well, I do know one.
Well, come on, tell us, Lucy.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, go ahead.
Well, it seems there were these two fellows, Pat and Mike, and they were working together building a house, and every time that Pat bent over to pick up something, Mike kicked him.
I'm not finished yet.
Oh.
Anyway, Pat finally decided to put some dynamite in his back pocket, and he said, "The next time Mike kicks me, he'll blow his foot off.
"   Oh, that's a real gem.
That was a lollapalooza!
What do you say we all I know another one.
Oh.
Well, go ahead and tell it, honey.
Go ahead.
Well, it seems there was this bashful little worm and he saw another worm and he fell in love with it, and said, "Will you marry me"?
And the other worm said, "Don't be silly.
This is my other end.
" That's all.
That's all!
Pretty good, huh?
Pretty good?
That was better than the first one!
Oh, honey, I got to hand it to you.
You're a great little storyteller.
Really?
Do you really think so?
Yeah, honey.
Well, let's all play bridge.
Yeah!
That's a great idea.
Oh, dear.
What's the matter, honey?
Oh, now you'll all start arguing over who has to play with me.
Why, are you kidding?
You are my partner and nobody else's.
Now, that's not fair, Ricky.
You get Lucy for a partner all the time, and tonight I want her.
No.
Tonight it's men against women.
Lucy, you're my partner.
Oh, now I'm not going to argue with you.
No, no, no, no.
I want to play with Lucy.
Aw, Ricky Fellas, fellas, fellas, don't fight over me.
We can sort of take turns.
You can sort of share me.
Sort of share!
All right.
All right, all right.
Just so I can play with her a little bit, that's all.
Here we go.
You got the chairs and stuff, Fred?
Yeah.
All right.
Gee, I feel so much better now.
You liked my jokes and you want me for a bridge partner- the next thing I know, you'll be asking me to sing.
Don't you want to hear me sing?
Sing?
Sure, honey.
Do we?
!
Oh!
Oh, come on, sing us a song, honey.
Who stole my heart away?
Who makes me dream all day?
Dreams I know will Oh, I feel so much better now.

{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Hi, Ricky.
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Come in.
Aw hi, sweetie.
Where's Lucy?
She went out shopping.
Do you know that this little character has already outgrown his clothes?
No kidding?
Come on.
Oh, isn't he a little doll?
Hi.
Hey, Ricky, he keeps looking at me with one eye.
Don't you wish he'd just stay like this?
Yeah.
Anything special on your mind?
Yeah, I came up to tell Lucy that the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League is meeting on Friday this week.
The Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League is meeting on Friday.
Yeah.
I thought you always met on Thursday.
Oh, no, we never met on Thursday.
We usually meet on Tuesday.
Well, look, this is probably a very stupid question but why couldn't the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts League meet on Wednesday?
Oh, we tried it, but nobody could make it.
Wednesday afternoon isn't a good day for club meetings.
That figures.
Why don't you forget about the meetings altogether?
Oh, now, Ricky, don't pick on our club.
It's really a very worthwhile organization.
Nobody asked your opinion.
He's going to grow up to be just like you.
Oh, I guess the club is all right, Ethel, but, you know, if Lucy wouldn't get so involved in it.
Every time she gets into it, I get into it, too.
Well, there's nothing to get into this time.
We're just going to nominate officers.
Oh, no.
You said it, kid.
What do you mean, you said it?
Don't you remember what happened on the last nominations?
Oh, that.
Yes, that.
Hey, Lucy, what's going on?
Oh, my women's club is meeting here today.
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.
Why do they have to meet here all the time?
Oh, honey, they haven't met here for three months.
We're taking turns until we can afford a clubhouse.
Honey, you don't need a clubhouse.
Why don't you meet on the back fence like other cats do?
Never mind now.
This is a very important meeting, especially for me.
We're nominating candidates for the club election.
I'll probably be nominated for every office.
I've acceptance speeches written for all of them.
Oh, you feel pretty sure of yourself, huh?
Well, honey, I know how the girls feel about me, that's all.
You think you're going to be elected for some office, huh?
Yeah, I'll be elected for something, surely.
Well, maybe I'll get a break and they'll elect you nothing.
Now, don't start on me about my women's club.
Okay, okay, I'll go spend the afternoon with Fred.
That's a good idea.
Hi, Ricky.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi, Ethel.
Oh, Lucy, that's a beautiful sweater.
Is it new?
Yeah, you like it?
It's gorgeous.
Ooh, cashmere?
Yeah, isn't that yummy?
Mm-hmm.
And look.
A bag to match.
Oh!
Isn't that the end?
Of course, I won't be able to afford another thing for three months, but who cares?
Oh, dear, this terrible pitcher and these cheap glasses.
Say, listen, Ethel, you are going to vote to admit Ruth Knickerbocker into the club, aren't you?
I don't know.
Well, she'd be a wonderful addition to the club.
You think so?
She seems sort of a quiet and mousey type to me.
Yeah, well, under that mousey exterior beats a cut glass punch bowl and 20 cups.
Oh That's the kind of a woman we need in our club.
That's the way I feel about it.
Oh, there they are, the thundering herd.
Lucy!
Lillian!
Hi!
Hi, how are you?
Ethel, how are you?
Lucy, that sweater, it's stunning.
Oh, thank you.
Look.
Oh, no, look at that bag to match.
Oh, what an outfit!
You know, I've been just dying for one.
Well, I got it Don't tell me.
I know how expensive they are, and I just can't afford it.
All right, I won't tell you.
Oh, say, listen, before the others get here, have you heard the dirt about Marion?
Marion Strong?
Yes!
What?
Oh, let me tell you.
You know how she's always trying to pretend she's somebody?
Oh, do I. Well, she finally got her comeuppance.
What happened?
She did?
Well, let me tell you.
I ran into her on the street the other day, and she had on the most Marion!
Marion!
Oh, hi.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
Lucy, you have new furniture.
The whole thing is new.
Lucy, I got you a chair.
We're all ready to start.
Girls?
Ladies, ladies.
Shh.
Ladies.
The meeting will come to order.
Now, we'll skip the minutes of the last meeting and get right down to business.
Madam President.
Yes, Lillian.
I would like to submit the name of Ruth Knickerbocker for membership in our club.
I think that's a wonderful idea.
Very well.
You all had a chance to meet Ruth at our last meeting, so if there's no more discussion, we'll vote.
All those in favor of asking Ruth Knickerbocker to join our club say aye.
Aye.
Noes?
No noes.
Ruth Knickerbocker  Ruth Knickerbocker is now a member of our club.
And now, the election of officers.
The chair will entertain nominations for the office of Treasurer.
Yes.
The chair recognizes Pauline Lobos.
Well, Madam President, I would like to nominate for Treasurer one of our most conscientious members.
Now this girl really deserves an office in our club.
She's a wonderful person and a fine character and a real leader- Grace Munson.
Me?
Are there any more nominations?
Oh, Grace, you'll make a wonderful Treasurer.
Of course, I wouldn't be Treasurer if they handed it to me on a silver platter.
You wouldn't?
Terrible job.
And now nominations are open for the office of Secretary.
The chair recognizes Marion Strong.
I nominate a member who well, she's just about the most wonderful person.
She's the loyalest person in the club and she's always ready to lend a hand when you ask her to.
She's intelligent, pretty and one of the nicest persons you could ever meet my very dear, dear friend, Lillian Appleby.
Lillian!
Are there any more nominations?
Oh, Lillian, you'll make a wonderful Secretary.
Secretary is really a very thankless job, you know.
Oh, is it?
Very.
Now, let me hear nominations for the office of Vice President.
Madam President.
Chair recognizes Lillian Appleby.
For the office of Vice President, I would like to nominate a girl who really deserves the job.
A girl who will fight for our club.
You can tell that from the color of her hair.
My very dearest, dearest friend, Marion Strong.
Are there any more nominations for Vice President?
Oh, Marion, you'll make a wonderful Vice President.
Vice President's merely a figurehead, you know.
Oh, really?
They work in name only.
Oh.
And now we come to the most important office of all- the presidency.
As far as I'm concerned there's only one person who should follow me in the office of President.
She has administrative ability, she's charming, makes a good appearance.
In fact, she'll be a wonderful President, and I'm so sure that you're all going to elect her unanimously that I want to be the first to shake the hand of our next president.
Ethel Mertz!
Ethel Mertz?
Yes.
Oh, I don't Please let us come to order now.
Ladies.
Ladies.
I'm sure there will be no more nominations for President.
So I hereby declare the nominations Uh, Madam President.
Yes, the chair recognizes Mrs. Ricardo.
I think that there should be some more nominations for presidency.
Why, Lucy Oh, it isn't that I don't feel that you'll make a wonderful president, Ethel.
It's just that I feel that the more democratic way is to have more than one nominee.
It doesn't matter who it is, just so there are two.
You understand.
Well yeah.
Well, do I hear another nomination for President?
Since there are no more nominations for President, I hereby declare the nomina Madam President.
Yes, Lucy?
I'd like time-out for a caucus.
A- A-A what?
A caucus.
Didn't you watch the conventions on television?
Oh Well Well, very well, all right caucus.
Come on, Lillian, let's caucus.
You know, television has changed the thinking of the entire world.
She wouldn't have had sense enough to caucus this time last year.
You look it up in the bylaws.
Ethel, you ought to filibuster.
Really, you should filibuster.
Madam President.
Yes, Lillian.
I would like to nominate Lucy Ricardo for President.
Oh!
Oh, well, I Well, you see, I feel that if there are two, it's the more American way of doing It's democratic, it's, uh Well, how's the campaign coming, Lucy, dear?
Just fine, Ethel, honey.
Just fine, sweetie.
That's good.
You know, running for the same office might bother some good friends, but it doesn't bother me a bit.
Well, it doesn't bother me either.
I just feel it's all in the family.
Sure, all in the family.
That's the way I feel.
Hey, you should see the cute campaign poster that Lucy made.
Oh, honey, don't bother to show them that.
No, let's see it.
Oh, don't be silly.
"Happy you will be with Lucy, cast your vote and wait till you see.
" Oh!
Oh, that's darling, honey.
That's pretty good.
They're sort of fun to make, you know.
Ethel wrote some good ones, too.
Uh, Fred  Oh?
What were they?
Well, one of them said, uh "You can go farther with Ethel.
" Oh!
Oh, that's just darling.
That's like that gasoline ad.
Yeah.
Hey, here's another one.
Oh, never mind, Ricky, never mind.
That's enough, dear.
Oh, this is a beaut.
"Nertz to Mertz"?
It's a joke, dear.
Oh, a joke.
It's very amusing.
Oh, boy, and you were worried about that one you wrote about her.
Now, Fred Uh, Fred What was it?
"A vote for the redhead is a vote for a deadhead.
" And then she put underneath Uh, never mind, never mind.
Come on, let's play cards.
Oh, wait a minute.
Just a minute.
Uh, Fred, what was it that was underneath?
Well, underneath "deadhead" she wrote "or should I say dyedhead.
" Well, that's a fine thing to say.
Well, "Nertz to Mertz" isn't exactly a bouquet of roses.
Now, wait a minute, hold it candidates.
Don't lose your tempers.
Nobody's losing her temper.
It's just good to know what I'm running against, that's all.
Well, the same goes for me.
I might have known you'd resort to mudslinging.
And I might have known you would conduct a smear campaign.
Smear campaign?
Give me that thing.
I'll show you what a real smear campaign is.
This isn't nearly strong enough.
Well, if that's the way you want to play, I've got some ideas of my own.
Come on, Fred.
Well, that's perfectly all right with me.
You can play anyway that you want, and see if I care.
Okay!
I'm going to do that poster I decided not to do.
You mean, "With our club's welfare do not tinker.
Lucy Ricardo's a dirty " That's the one.
That's going to be tame next to the ones that I'm going to write!
I see.
I see.
Uh-huh.
Well, it was nice talking with you, Marion.
Mm-hmm.
No, no, no, I didn't call for anything special.
Uh, by the way, who do you think is going to be our next club president?
Lucy or Ethel?
Oh.
Oh!
Oh Well, if that's the way it is, then that's the way it's got to be.
A divorce will be the best thing for her.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'll see you next week at the Wednesday Afternoon Fine Arts Club.
Who did you say you were going to vote for?
Oh, good choice, good choice.
Bye.
She's voting for Ethel.
Ethel?
What was all that "good choice, good choice" for?
Well, that was to throw her off the scent so she wouldn't know what we were doing.
Fine thing.
Ethel and I are tied.
Half the club's voting for Ethel, half the club's voting for me.
Oh.
Well, we haven't heard from Ruth Knickerbocker yet.
She wasn't home.
Oh, dear, how do you like that?
She's only been in the club a week and she's going to decide who the next president is.
I think I'm going to have to put a little friendly pressure on Ruth Knickerbocker this week.
Well, Lucy, dear, I really must be going now.
Well, it was certainly nice of you to come over this afternoon, Lillian.
You know, Lucy, I'm a little ashamed at what I've done for you this afternoon.
Oh You know, I really shouldn't have.
Well, I certainly appreciate it.
You know that, Lillian.
I sure do, dear.
Thanks very much.
Well, Lucy, really, I do have to go now.
Yes?
Oh!
Bye, Lucy.
Good-bye.
Hi, Rick.
Hi, Fred.
Want to join me?
No, thanks.
That's the same thing I had for dinner.
Where's Lucy?
Oh, I don't know.
Ever since this club election started, she's never home.
She's out campaigning.
Yeah, Ethel, too.
She's rushing that new member right off her feet.
You mean Ruth Knickerbocker?
Yeah.
Hers is the deciding vote, you know?
Ethel's had her to tea, then to dinner, and a couple of movies.
That's funny.
Lucy had her out to lunch twice, and last night she took her to dinner and to the theater.
Mm-hmm.
That kid's being pulled apart like the last girdle at a bargain sale.
Well, I hope she votes for Ethel.
Well, I don't.
Just think how involved my life will be if Ethel is president of that club.
Listen, you just think how involved my life is with Lucy just being Lucy.
Yeah, you got a point there.
Yeah.
Boy, she's not going to be elected president of that club if I can help it.
Well, there's nothing much we can do about it, except pray.
Well, I don't know.
There must be something that we can do.
If there was only some way that I could sway the Knickerbocker vote.
Then I could See you later, Lucy!
Hey, Fred!
Good-bye, Fred.
Adios.
Ethel will be home any minute.
Yeah, so long, Fred.
So long.
Good-bye.
Good-bye Knickerbocker, Knickerbocker, Knickerbock Knickerbock..

Hello, information?
I'd like to have Ruth Knickerbocker's phone number, please.
Knickerbocker.
Listen, if I knew how to spell it I wouldn't have to call information.
Knickerbocker, I don't know.
N- i-k-e-r-b-o-k-e-r.

There's nobody by that name?
Look again, will you?
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
That's it.
With a "K"?
Well, give me the number.
Thank you.
With a "K"?
Wonder why they put a "K" in front Hello, Miss K-nickerbocker?
This is Ricky Ricardo.
Lucy's husband, you know.

Hi, fellas.
We came down to the club to celebrate.
Celebrate?
Yeah, the club elections were tonight.
Yeah, and we both won- it was a tie.
We are co-presidents.
What, what, what?
How can it be a tie?
How about Ruth Knickerbocker's vote?
Oh, she wasn't there.
She's home sick in bed from all the rich food that Ethel and I fed her all week.
What do you mean she's home sick in bed?
She's sitting right here.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Knickerbocker.
Oh, that isn't Ruth Knickerbocker.
She isn't?
No.
You're not?
No.
That's Ruth's mother-in-law.

Ricky!
Lucy!
Ow!
What are you trying to do, kill me?
Well, what are you doing sneaking around behind the door?
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't make so much noise.
What's going on?
You're going to wake up the kid.
She slammed the door on my nose.
I did not.
He walked right into it.
You okay now, Fred?
I wouldn't be surprised if it's broken.
I may never smell again.
You want to bet?
Oh, go on, make jokes.
You probably knew I was behind the door.
I did not.
Anyway, I don't see how the door got near your nose with that big stomach bumper you've got.
I just hope you haven't marred this classic profile, that's all.
Oh, brother.
RICKY : Let me see, Fred.
Hey, you got quite a bump.
I wouldn't be surprised if that eye turns black.
Yeah?
Now you see what you've done.
Here I am with a black eye and I got to go to a lodge meeting tonight.
Well, you got a perfect excuse.
You're probably the only person in history who ever really got a black eye by walking into a door.
But they'll never believe that.
Why not?
It's the truth.
No, that doesn't matter.
Nobody ever believes the real story of a black eye.
I don't see why not.
Well, I seem to remember one occasion that you didn't believe Lucy and me.
When?
Oh, I did too believe you.
You did not.
I did, too.
You certainly had a funny way of showing it.
I'll never forget how surprised I was by your attitude.
Lucy and I were just sitting at home minding our own business.
She was reading a book, and I walked into the room and that's when the whole thing started.
Hey, honey, you seen the book I was reading?
I thought I left it on that table there.
What could I have done with my book?
Hey, that's my book.
Hey, what are you doing?
!
Well, that's the book I was reading.
I was reading it last night.
Well, I'm reading it tonight.
Now, Lucy, be fair.
The book belongs to the person who started it first.
It does not.
There's a new rule: readers keepers, losers go look at television.
That rule does not apply to Cubans.
Now, Ricky, come on.
Come on, now, give me the book!
Oh, this is getting us nowhere.
Come on, we'll read it together.
Oh, all right.
Can you see all right to read?
Sure.
"Madge went into the darkened room and there she saw " Lucy's thumb.
Oh.
Sorry.
How's that?
That's fine.
: "Gordon plunged a knife into her back several times.
"She tried desperately to fight back.
"But the blood, oozing from her many wounds, "poured about her feet as she slipped to the ground "taking the lamp, electrocuting herself.
Nothing but a pile of ashes was left.
" Are you ready to turn the page?
No, I'm not ready to turn the page.
You were mumbling so loud I wasn't able to concentrate.
I haven't read a word yet.
Oh, well, there's nothing on that page anyway.
Madge tried to poison Gordon, Gordon found out about it and he tried to run her over with his car.
That's all.
Next page.
"Gordon left the house dismembering the housekeeper"?
Ew!
"Disposing of her body in the garbage disposal " Honey, will you please stop mumbling?
Well, I'm just reading.
Well, honey, can you read with your mouth close?
Okay.
Oh, no, no, no, this won't work.
No, no, I can't read that way.
No.
I can't read that way!
How about one of us reading out loud to the other?
All right.
Okay.
Well, go ahead.
"Madge se levantÃ³ de la carretera "y fue donde estaba "cuando llegÃ³ ahÃ­ with the car, Gordon le dijo: "'Madge, ven acÃ¡,' y le dio asÃ­ en la cara "iPim, pum, pam, pum!
"Y entonces la pobre muchacha tenÃ­a blood all over the place "y le dijo 'iNo, no me des mÃ¡s, no me des mÃ¡s!
Perdona, Gordon, ino, no me des mÃ¡s!
'" When I read, I translate into Spanish as I go along.
Yeah.
"Madge got up from the road "after Gordon had run her over with the car "and ran to him.
"She was beaten and torn.
"Her clothes were in shreds "And blood poured from her many wounds.
"Their eyes met.
"Then in a feeble voice, Madge said, "'You don't like me, do you?
'" "Suddenly, she gathered strength.
"'Go ahead, admit it,' she shouted 'You hate me!
'" Honey "You hate me, don't you?
Lucy.
Don't you"?
!
You don't have to shout!
Honey, you don't have to shout.
I can't help it!
: I can't help it.
I get carried away with this stuff.
All right, go ahead.
But try to control yourself.
Okay.
"Gordon couldn't stand it any longer.
"He screamed at her, 'Okay, Madge, you asked for it.
' "He started slowly toward her.
"Madge's eyes showed terror.
"He came closer, closer closer " Wait a minute, Fred.
Don't just walk in.
Ring the bell.
Well, we always just walk in.
Yeah, I know, but they don't know we're coming and people like a little privacy.
Well, these aren't people.
They're Ricky and Lucy.
Ring the bell.
All of a sudden you're so sensitive.
LUCY : "I was right.
I knew it.
I was right.
You do hate me, don't you"?
No, wait.
"No, you wouldn't.
You wouldn't strike me"!
What's going on In there?
"Go ahead, you cad, hit me!
"I dare you.
I dare you.
I dare you"!
Ah!
She went one "I dare you" too far.
She should know better than to dare that hot-blooded Cuban.
Why, that big bum hit her.
No, Fred, wait.
Come here.
I'm thinking of them.
When they hear the bell they'll go to neutral corners.
We can't just bust in on them at a time like this.
Don't you feel well, Ethel?
I thought you'd be dying to get in there and see what the fight's all about.
Fred No, there's just one decent thing to do.
We'll go downstairs and phone.
What for?
To let them know we're coming up.
Then we'll go in and see what the fight's about.
"Later that night "Madge was crying softly in her room "waiting for the phone to ring.
"They said they'd call "if they found Gordon's battered body "when they dragged the river.
"She waited and waited.
Wouldn't that phone ever ring"?
They found the body!
Honey, what's the matter?
!
That's our phone.
Oh.
Hello?
Hello, Lucy.
This is Ethel.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Why?
Lucy, this is Ethel.
Yeah, I know.
This is Ethel, your friend.
To whom you may turn in a moment of crisis.
Ethel, have you been drinking?
Okay, don't tell me.
We thought we'd come up.
Unless, of course, there's some reason you don't want to see us right now.
No, come on up.
We're just sitting here reading.
"We're just sitting here reading," she says.
Okay, we'll be up.
Anything we can bring?
Cookies?
Ice cream?
lodine?
No, not a thing.
Come on up.
Okay.
lodine?
What does Ethel want?
They're coming up.
Oh, I want to find out what happened to Madge and Gordon.
Well, we'll find out later.
I'm going to go put on a new face.
All right.
Oh, listen, honey, put this by the bed and then we can read it before we go to sleep.
Oh!
My eye!
Oh, honey oh, what happened, honey?
Oh Oh, honey, oh, I'm sorry.
- Did I hit you in the eye?
- Oh, yes.
Oh, gee, honey, I'm sorry, doll.
Well, it wasn't your fault, honey.
Oh, gosh, it hurts so.
Right there.
Let me look at it.
Oh Oh, you sure got a whack.
Oh It's starting to get black already.
Oh, really?
That's all I need: a black eye.
Oh, honey.
Oh, that must be the Mertzes.
You let them in.
I'm going to go put something cold on this.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
It's all right, dear.
Oh Hi, Ethel.
Hello, Ricky.
Hi, Fred.
Hi, Rick.
Where's Lucy?
Oh, she'll be right in.
Won't you sit down?
Fine.
Honey, it is the Mertzes!
They're here!
He's a cool customer, isn't he?
Fast, too.
He hasn't got a scratch on him.
What's new?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing.
What's new up here?
Nothing.
Just sitting around.
Oh?
I see.
Uh would you, uh Would you like a drink or something?
Oh, no, thanks.
No?
No, thanks.
Hi, folks.
Lucy Oh, you poor little thing.
What?
Oh, my eye.
Yeah, your eye.
How did it happen?
Oh Ricky slugged me.
Yeah.
Yeah, I finally decided to, boom, let her have it.
Oh, you better come down and stay with us, honey.
What?
What do you mean, Ethel?
Imagine, striking a woman.
Oh, Fred, Ethel, I was just kidding.
Now, don't try to protect him, honey.
He isn't worth it.
No, really.
I just said that Ricky slugged me because nobody ever believes the real story of a black eye.
Yeah.
And what is the real story?
Ricky tossed a book to me, I missed it, and it hit me in the eye.
Yeah.
Oh, come now.
You can do better than that.
No, really, Ethel, that's what happened.
How do you like it, they never believe the real story.
How do you like that?
For goodness' sakes, Ethel, you don't think that I would actually hit Lucy, do you?
Apparently they don't want to take us into their confidence.
Come on, Fred.
Oh, now, Ethel, come here.
No.
There are times when even the best friends are unwelcome.
Now, wait a minute, you two.
Now, listen, Fred, let me explain to you what Please, please.
Don't drag us into your sordid family squabbles.
Shall we go, Ethel?
Well, did you ever?
How do you like that?
Well, I'll explain it to her in the morning.
Come on, now we can find out what happened to Madge and Gordon.
Okay.
Good morning, Lucy.
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Has the brute gone?
Who?
Oh, Ricky.
Yeah, he's gone to rehearsal.
Let me see your eye.
Oh, boy.
That rat really gave you a mouse.
Gee, I'm sorry I talked to you the way I did last night.
I couldn't sleep a wink.
Well, honey, I accept your apology.
I'm not apologizing.
I couldn't sleep 'cause I didn't know the real story.
Come on, tell me.
What happened?
I told you, Ethel: Ricky tossed a book to me, I missed it and it hit me in the eye.
I know, I know.
That's the story for publication.
Now, what's the gory truth?
How many times do I have to tell you, honey?
Ricky tossed a You're not going to be satisfied until you get a real juicy story out of me, are you?
No.
Come on.
Okay.
Well, last night Ricky and I were sitting around after dinner.
We got into a little argument.
Close your mouth.
Where was I?
You were sitting around after dinner when, suddenly, Ricky grabbed you by the hair and slugged you.
Yeah.
Go on.
Well, like you say, he grabbed me by the hair, and he slugged me.
Yeah.
No!
And then he slugged me again Pow!
Oh!
Pow!
Oh!
And then what?
He came at me.
You know how wild those Cubans are when they get mad.
He grabbed me by the throat.
I gasped for air.
I cried for mercy.
"Mercy!
Mercy!
Mercy"!
And then he said he hated you.
Okay.
Finally, who knows why, he let go.
And I lay there cowering and whimpering "Please, no, oh, oh, no.
" He just looked down at me, and he laughed.
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha"!
And then he kicked me.
He was just about to kick me again when the phone rang.
Oh, this is even better than I expected.
Uh, what started it all?
What made him so mad?
I don't know.
You don't know?
No.
We were just sitting around talking about the weather, his new show at the club.
I told him I was in love with another man and all of a sudden, for no reason at all Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Back up.
You said you were in love with another man?
Oh, no, no, I didn't say that.
Who is it?
!
Who?
Who?
Nobody.
I couldn't possibly tell you, Ethel.
Why, is it somebody I know?
Who is it?
!
I'm not going to tell you.
Oh, Lucy, you can't stop there.
I am not going to tell you.
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
I shouldn't have told you Well, what am I going to do tonight?
No!
I am not going to tell you.
Oh, Rick!
Hey, Ricky!
Wait a minute.
Oh, hiya, Fred.
What's the matter?
Where you rushing off to?
Well, I'm going to rehearsal.
I'm late now.
What's up?
Well, I wanted to talk to you about last night.
I wasn't really sore at you.
I was going along with Ethel.
Last night?
Yeah.
Oh!
Well, let me tell you about that Listen, I know just how you felt.
No, you don't.
Oh, yes I do.
I've been married a lot longer than you have.
And you should never have lost your temper that much.
However, it's done, and there's one way out of it.
I see.
What's that?
Don't stand on false pride.
Whether you're right or wrong be big about it.
Apologize.
Send her some flowers.
Well, that's very sweet of you to be so concerned about it, Fred, but, uh, I told you what happened last night.
You don't think that I would ever really hit Lucy, do you?
If you give her a chance to brood it'll cost more than flowers.
Now, why don't you be smart?
Look, Fred, I'm late.
I'll talk to you about it later.
Now, listen, I really know about these things, Rick.
Come on in now and send her some flowers.
Wait a minute, Fred.
This is getting silly.
I didn't do anything last night.
I'm not going to send anybody any flowers, and I'm already late for rehearsal, so good-bye.
Good morning, Mr. Mertz.
Oh, hello, Pete.
I want you to pick me out a dozen beautiful red roses and I'd like to have them delivered this afternoon.
Gee, I'm afraid you're too late.
Our delivery truck is just leaving.
See if you can catch him, will you?
I'll try.
Thanks.
Hey, Phil!
Phil, hold it a second!
Hold it!
Okay, I caught him.
Oh, fine.
Thanks.
I'll have this card ready in a minute.
Right.
Hey, Pete, what are these?
Gladiolus.
Gladiolus?
That's right.
They're beautiful.
Put some of those in, will ya?
Okay, fine.
They're grand.
Mm-hmm.
There we are.
There, you got 'em?
One second.
Address is right on that envelope.
Okay, fine.
They'll have it in a jiffy.
Well, they're on their way.
Oh, fine.
I want them to get up there before her husband gets home.
Why, Mr. Mertz!
Oh, now, now, now.
Just a minute.
Ricky and Lucy had a little fight last night.
Ricky's a little stubborn so I'm sending her some roses in his name.
Oh, I see.
Wait till she sees that card.
I wrote, "Darling, I love you, I love you, I love you.
" Oh.
And then I signed it, "Eternally yours, Fred.
" Fred?
Fred!
Stop that truck!
Get that card!
It's too late!
It's left.
Oh, no!
Wait a minute!
You didn't pay me!
Hey, Fred.
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Well, why did you run in the door like that?
Well, well, I-I couldn't wait to get home to you.
Oh.
Me?
!
Yeah.
Hey, you haven't seen any deliveries in the last few minutes Laundry?
Groceries?
No, nothing like that.
Oh.
Just a florist.
He left some flowers for Lucy and she wasn't home, so I took 'em.
Yeah?
Well, where are they?
I put them up in her apartment.
Gee, I was dying to peek in the box and see who they were from.
If she doesn't come home pretty soon, I think I will.
Oh, no, no, no!
I don't want my wife doing anything like that.
Besides, they must be from Ricky.
Maybe they are, and maybe they aren't.
Well, I'll see you later.
Where are you going?
Uh I'm going to turn the heat up.
It's cold in here.
Turn the heat up?
It's like an oven in here!
Yeah, by gosh, you're right.
I better turn the heat down.
Lucy?
Lucy?
Lucy?
Lucy?
Ooh!
Gee.
Ooh!
La, la-la-la Oh, hello, Lucy!
Hi!
I didn't know you were home.
Yeah, I just got here.
Look, Ethel flowers!
Oh?
Gee, I wonder who they're from.
So do I. They're probably from him.
"Him"?
Him whom?
You know him whom.
M.L. Oh!
Mystery lover.
They're probably from Ricky.
Ooh, I'm so excited!
Oh!
Aren't they lovely!
Oh, gee.
Yeah, they're from Ricky.
Yeah?
Look at the card and see.
Ethel, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you.
Here, you look at the card and then you'll know who my mystery lover is.
Okay.
"Darling, I love you, I love you, I love you.
Eternally yours, Fred.
" Fred?
!
Fred?
!
Fred who?
You know Fred who.
Oh, now, Ethel, you certainly don't think that these are from Fred Mertz, do you?
Well, this card certainly wasn't written By Fred MacMurray.
Oh, now, Ethel.
Fred, my beautiful, fat old goat your mystery lover.
This is just ridiculous.
How can I fall for a fat old goat like him?
Don't you talk like that about Fred!
Well, you said it first.
Well, I can say it.
He's my old goat.
This is just silly.
I'm not going to discuss it.
Oh, yes, you are!
Oh, no, I'm not!
Oh, yes, you are!
Oh, no, I'm not!
I'm not going to say one word!
Oh, yes, you are!
Wait a minute.
Well, if it isn't old mystery lover.
Fred, what were you doing in my closet?
"Fred, what were you doing in my closet"?
Oh, brother.
Ethel, my love!
Don't you "Ethel, my love" me!
Oh!
My eye!
My eye!
Oh, Ethel, really!
Don't you talk to me!
Fred, how are you?
What's the matter?
I'll show you what the matter is!
This is!
Oh!
What happened?
Well?
Ethel and I have an apology to make.
Oh?
You remember that story you told us about you getting a black eye when Ricky tossed a book to you?
Yes?
It is possible.
Oh.
And how did you finally arrive at that conclusion?
Ethel!
Oh, no.
Did Fred tell you how it happened?
You mean that phony story about tossing a book to you?
Yeah.
Oh, come now.
You can do a lot better than that, can't you?
Oh, Lucy, I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I'm sorry, too, Rick.
It can happen.
That's all right, Fred.
I wanted to take a couple of days off from work anyway.

Oh, hi, Ethel.
Lucy isn't here.
She took the baby down to Mrs. Jenkins.
What's going on around here?
Oh, Lucy rearranged the furniture again.
But she just rearranged it last week.
No!
Oh, well, she'll rearrange it back again in a couple of days.
I just hope that she gets my favorite chair over there where there's some light so I can see.

Ask Lucy, Ethel.
Yeah.
This is nothing.

Well, she's trying to make up her mind.
First she couldn't decide what movie she wanted to go to.
That took until 5:00.
Then she couldn't decide what dress she was gonna wear.
She's changed clothes half a dozen times.
I guess she's just a woman.
No, no, son, that's your fault.
You've trained her wrong.
You mean that doesn't happen at your house?
I should say not.
The first dress Ethel puts on is the dress she wears.
Oh, how do you manage that?
That's easy.
I've only got one dress.
Very funny.
Go on, Rick, will you?
Do something.
I'll be ready in a minute, dear!
I swear that she can see through the walls.
Boy, I'm starved.
Oh, you can live off your fat for a few more minutes.
You might as well get comfortable.
Sit down, will you?
Well, come on.
What are you waiting for?
Where are you going to dinner?
I don't know.
How about some good Italian food?
Oh, you know, I kind of felt like Chinese food tonight.
Well, that's okay with me as long as we eat.
Yeah, me, too.
How about you, Lucy?
Gee, they both sound so good.
I like Chinese food, but I'm crazy about Italian food, too.
Well, maybe we can find a place that serves ravioli foo yong.
Or chicken chow pizza.
Uh, Italian food sounds okay by me.
All right.
Okay.
Let's go.
Oh, darn it!
As you were, diners.
I just happened to think, we ate Italian food a couple of nights ago.
All right, then, we'll have Chinese food.
All right.
Okay.
Oh, wait a minute!
Don't tell me.
You want a steak.
No, smartie, but I just happened to remember that Chinese restaurant we like so much isn't open on Monday nights.
Well, honey, there's a lot of Chinese restaurants in town.
We'll go to another Chinese restaurant.
Oh, I don't know.
I don't want to go to a strange Do you want a steak?
Oh No, I don't want a steak.
No.
I just want to go anyplace- anyplace that I can eat- anything at all, I don't care where we go.
Well, let's go someplace that's new and exciting.
There's a lot of ads in the paper.
Lucy.
Yeah, look, here's one right here.
Come here.
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi This looks wonderful.
Look at this.
See?
Fred.
What do you think you're doing?
Well, this may take some time, and I thought I'd better fortify myself.
It's a nice restaurant.
Yes, it is, Lucy.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Stop whistling.
Well, I know what I want.
Let's get a waiter and order.
Oh, uh, waiter.
Waiter, we know what we want.
Waiter?
He didn't see me.
Uh, waiter.
Waiter, we're ready to Waiter?
I'll get him when he comes back.
I'll lay you three to one.
Oh, uh, waiter.
Waiter, dear!
Nice try.
He gets by me again over my dead body.
Well, are we ready to order now?
Yes, we're ready to order.
I'd like roast beef, please.
Yeah, one roast beef.
Henry?
Uh, yes, pardon me just a second.
I'll be back in a moment.
Honey, that's the first time that I heard you make up your mind and order just like that.
Well, I happened to know what I wanted.
Look, honey, there's an empty table back there by the window.
Let's move back there.
Honey, what's wrong with this table?
Oh, but look, we have that nice view while we're eating.
Come on!
Oh, now, Lucy!
Honey, now, wait a minute.
We got the silverware, the water, everyth Oh, take the silverware with us.
Come on.
It's chilly.
Oh, come on.
Oh, this table is taken.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Come on.
Okay.
There we are.
See how much nicer it is over here?
There.
Now, has everybody got everything they need?
I've got three knives.
I beat you, I got a full house- three forks and a pair of spoons.
Give me a fork, Fred.
I'll give you a knife.
I got nothing.
And a spoon, Fred.
Okay, okay, I got it.
How's that?
Is that it?
Fine, fine.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Fine.
Psst!
Psst!
Psst!
Henry.
Oh, there you are!
Yes, now, uh, where were we?
We were over there.
Never mind.
I ordered roast beef.
Eh, one roast beef.
And what would you like, Ethel?
I think I'll have the lamb chops.
One lamb chops.
What looks good to you, Rick?
Well Lamb chops, huh?
See, that sounds good.
They're not fattening either.
Would you mind changing my order to lamb chops?
Two lamb chops.
That's two for each of us.
Yes.
Oh, an-and, uh, I don't want too much fat on mine, but I would like them extra thick.
Maybe you'd like to have me trot the lamb by, and you can pick out the chops you want.
Well!
Lucy, please?
Go ahead, Rick, order somethin'.
Sirloin steak.
Uh, yes, sir.
How would you like it?
Rare.
Thick and juicy.
Yes, sir.
And you, sir?
Well, uh, let me see.
I believe I'm going to try the, uh Sirloin steak, huh?
How would you like it, madam?
Well, medium or rare?
Rare.
Pork chops.
Yes, sir.
Now, what would you like to drink?
Well, I You order last.
Um, coffee for me.
I'll have coffee, too.
Two coffees.
Milk.

Now, madam, what would you like?
Pork chops, huh?
Would it be too much bother to change my order to pork chops?
Why, no, madam.
Whatever gave you that idea?
I'd like two pork chops, please.
Very well.
Why don't you write it down?
I already did when he ordered it.
Now, let's see if I've got this straight.
Lamb chops for you, sirloin steak for you, uh, pork chops for you, pork chops for you, and a new eraser for me.
You know, with all this talk about pork chops, I Yeesh!
I guess I'll stick to lamb chops.
Now, how about shrimp cocktails all around?
Uh That'd be fine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
What did you do that for?
Honey, I'm sick and tired of hearing you change your mind every two seconds.
Well, I couldn't help it.
Everything everybody ordered sounded so wonderful.
Fine thing, you come to a restaurant and you can't even order what you  Bless you!
You catching a cold, honey?
Well, there's a horrible draft in here.
You want to change places with me?
Oh, no, that wouldn't do any good.
Oh, look, there's an empty table over there.
Let's go over there.
Stand by for another troop movement.
Honey, we're going to stay right here.
No, now, come on.
It's nice over th Sit down!
What do you want me to do?
Catch my death of cold?
No, but we came from there Well, then come on.
Come on over here.
There's no reason why we can't move over here.
Why fight it?
Okay, here we go again.
See how much better it is over here?
Mm-mm-hmm.
I hate to sit in a draft.
All right, hon.
Oh, uh, we're over here now.
You see, we were over there, but there was such a draft, I couldn't  Good morning, Lucy.
Hi.
What are you doing?
Oh, I've been cleaning out that closet.
Oh.
I'm on a new regime.
I'm gonna finish everything I start.
I started cleaning out that closet 11 years ago.
Yeah, right after we were married.
You should see the stuff I found in there.
I've just been reading some of my old mementos.
Uh, Lucy, tell me something.
How did you happen to start on this new regime?
Oh, I just thought it was the thing to do.
Lucy, does anybody else on this floor speak with an accent?
What do you mean by that?
Well, last night when I was out in the hall changing a lightbulb, and I heard some Cuban yelling at his wife and saying that from now on, she had to finish everything she starts.
Ethel, do you sleep with your ears under or over the covers?
Well, the walls of this apartment are pretty thin.
He really was upset, wasn't he?
Wasn't he?
Why, his face turned absolutely purple.
These walls are a lot thinner than I thought.
Uh I mean, he sounded like it was purple.
Oh.
Hey, listen to this.
I wrote this 15 years ago.
"Dearest, darling Tom, As long as I live, I can never forget you.
" Tom who?
I don't remember.
Oh, fine.
"Being with you the other night was pure heaven.
Remember how we " Well, don't stop now.
Go on.
That's all there is.
Oh.
Oh, I remember now.
It was Tom Henderson.
And just as I was writing this letter, he called on the phone, we had a big fight, and I never finished it.
Oh.
Oh, I should never have fought with him.
He now owns a swanky fur salon downtown.
Oh, you fool.
Yeah.
Oh, well, so much for Tom Henderson.
Hey I'm supposed to finish everything I start, aren't I?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Lucy, are you gonna finish that letter?
Uh-huh.
Are you gonna mail it?
No.
Well, what's the use?
Who'll see it?
A certain purple-faced Cuban we both know.
As long as he's so insistent that I finish everything, I'm going to have a little fun with him.
Let's see now.
"Being with you the other night was pure heaven.
"Remember how we "Remember how we laughed and what fun we had"?
Hee, hee.
Uh, "See you for lunch tomorrow.
Love, Lucy.
"  Now, I'll just be finishing this when Ricky comes in, and I'll get all flustered when he catches me, see?
Oh, Lucy, I wish you had a window in your forehead so I could peek in and watch those wheels go 'round.
You'd better go now.
Ricky's gonna home for lunch any minute.
Okay.
Good luck.
Okay.
Well oh, I I Oh, Ethel!
Oh, I'm sorry, but I just got to thinking it over.
Do you think this is safe, what with Ricky's temper and all?
Oh, sure.
Well, good luck.
Okay.
Psst!
Psst!
Hey, Rick.
Hiya, Fred.
I've been waiting for ya.
Yeah?
What happened?
We men have to stick together.
What do you mean?
Ethel couldn't keep her big blabbermouth closed, so she told me a secret.
What's that?
Lucy found an old, unfinished love letter.
Oh?
Yeah, but she finished it this afternoon, and now she's waiting to have a little fun with you.
Is that so?
Yeah.
All right, Fred, thanks for telling me.
I'll see you later.
All right.
Ha, ha, ha!
A little fun, eh?
Oh!
Hi, honey.
Hi, honey.
Oh!
Uh Uh oh.
Uh, what you got there?
Where?
In back of you there.
Oh, nothing.
It-it's not for you to see.
Oh.
Oh, it's a surprise for me, eh?
Uh, yeah.
Well, I can wait.
All right, all right.
You want me to see the letter, let me have it.
No, no.
I don't want you to see it!
Honey, you've been waving it around like a flag.
Now, come on.
What is it?
Is it a bill?
No.
What are you laughing at?
Oh, this is very funny, this letter.
What's the gag?
It's no gag.
I guess I had to expect that sooner or later, you'd find out.
Now, Lucy we've been married for 11 years.
I know you like a book, and every time you act like this, you must have an interior motive.
"Ulterior," and I have not.
Come, come, now.
Are you by any chance trying to get back at me for that scolding that I gave you the other night?
No, and you think you're so smart.
Lucy?
Well, I'm not!
That's just what it looks like.
It's, it's a letter to Tom Henderson.
Oh, Tom Henderson?
Yes.
He's a big fur man downtown and-and Tom and I used to go to college together and-and we used to go around a lot together and we've been seeing each other since, that's all.
Oh, well, if that's all  You don't believe me, do you?
Sure, honey, sure, I believe you, yeah.
It's the truth!
Well, then, uh, you don't mind if I mail the letter?
No.
I-I wrote it to be mailed.
All right.
I'll mail it on my way to the club tonight.
Go ahead and see if I care.
See if I care about anything that you do!
I heard the voices being raised.
Oh, boy, is she mad.
What did you do?
I told her I was going to mail the letter.
That's not cricket, old boy.
Are you really gonna mail it?
No.
I'm just gonna to let her stew in her own goose for a while.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I know what you mean all right, but I just never heard it put that way before.
I don't know why you wanted to come down here anyway.
Because Ricky mailed the letter.
I have to explain to Tom.
Okay.
Come on.
Now, wait a minute.
I have to think what I'm going to say.
I haven't seen Tom Henderson in 15 years.
He'll think I'm crazy.
Oh, he'll understand.
Well, I hope you're right.
Gee, Ethel, do you think I've changed any in 15 years?
I got a little older, huh?
Don't be silly.
Women don't get older.
They just mature a little.
Men get older.
Yeah.
Well, of course, in Tom's case, it won't make any difference.
He was so handsome to start with.
He was certainly a gorgeous hunk of man.
Well, come on.
Hey, wait a minute.
You don't suppose that's Tom, do you?
Oh, he couldn't have changed that much.
I'll have it for you Tuesday.
Good-bye, Mrs. Corner.
Good-bye, Mr. Henderson.
Mr. Henderson.
That must be Tom.
That's a gorgeous hunk of man?
!
Looks like my hunk has shrunk.
Come on, let's forget the whole thing.
: Look!
Ricky and Fred!
Yeah.
They must have followed us.
Well, let's make a run for it, huh?
No, honey, they've seen us.
It's too late.
Listen, you-you go in there and pretend to buy a coat or something get Tom out of the way.
What good will that do?
Go on.
I'll think of something.
Okay.
I have just what you want, Mrs. Mertz.
I've got one on display in the window.
Uh, silver fox?
You know, Fred, I think this time she's really jumped her trolley.
Looks like.
Oh, hi, Ricky.
How nice to see you, dear.
And don't bother turning around, Tom.
It's just my husband.
What's going on here?
Oh, uh, Tom was just going to teach me a new dance step, Weren't you, dear?
How's that go again now?
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two     Is this your old boyfriend?
He isn't half the man he used to be.
Where, uh where is Tom Henderson?
Oh, Ricky, that letter was just a gag.
You were so darn smart about it, you made me mad, that's all.
: Well, what what about this dummy routine?
Didn't you know this guy at all?
Sure I did, but when I knew Tom, he was tall, dark and handsome.
I saw him today and he's short, bald and dumpy.
You never would have stopped kidding me about that.
Well, honey, I guess I was a little cruel.
Listen, you'll have lunch with a tall, dark and handsome man anyway.
Come on.
I'll take you.
Okay.
You know, it's a good thing he was a funny-looking guy, otherwise you'd be plenty worried by now, 'cause I was gonna go through with it.
Yeah, I don't have the slightest doubt.
Oh, Lucy?
Yeah?
Lucy, we made an awful mistake.
This isn't Tom Henderson.
It's his brother, Harry.
Oh!
Tom!
Why, Lucy!
The waiter was played by Frank Nelson.
Tom Henderson was played by Johnny Hart.
The woman in the fur salon was Sally Corner and the fur salesman was Phil Arnold.
I Love Lucy is a Desilu production.
ANNOUNCER 2: Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz will be back next week at this same time.
This is the CBS Television Network.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Good morning, Lucy.
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Where are you going so early?
Oh, I thought I'd go down and see the doctor.
What's the matter, honey, are you sick?
No, I just want to get a checkup.
I need a tonic or something.
I've been feeling real donsey.
Donsey?
Yeah.
That's a word my grandmother made up for when you're not really sick, but you just feel lousy.
Oh.
Oh, I-I don't know what's the matter with me.
I've been getting a lot of rest, and then I wake up feeling all dragged out in the morning.
I don't have much energy, and yet I've been putting on a lot of weight.
I just feel blah.
Well, maybe you need some vitamin pills or a liver shot or something.
Yeah.
Listen, don't tell Ricky that I went to see the doctor.
No sense worrying him.
Okay.
Gee, I-I'm going to have to go on a diet.
You know, I could hardly get into my dress this morning.
Hey, Lucy Hmm?
Wait a minute.
You don't suppose?
I don't suppose what?
You don't suppose you're going to have a baby?
Oh, of course not.
For heaven's sake.
A baby?
!
Yeah.
Baby.
That's a word my grandmother made up for tiny little people.
That's the silliest thing I ever heard of.
I've been married 11 years, Ethel.
I know it.
Now, get that look off your face.
You were a lot closer when you said I needed liver shots.
Well, we'll wait and see what the doctor says.
Oh, I got to go.
I'll see you later.
Good-bye, mummy.
I'm going to wait right here until you come back.
Go on.
Now, cut that out.
Let's have no more kidding about me having a baby.
The whole thought is utterly ridiculous.
Lucy?
What did the doctor say?
Lucy?
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Hi, Lucy.
What did the doctor say?
Ethel we're going to have a baby.
We are?
!
Oh oh, isn't that wonderful?
I I never had a baby before.
I mean, I've never been let in on it so soon.
Let in on it?
Why, you knew it even before I did.
This whole thing was practically your idea.
Aw!
Gee just think, Ethel.
I'm going to be a mother.
And I'm going to be a I am going to be something, aren't I?
Oh, sure, sure.
Y- You and Fred will be the godparents.
Oh, isn't that exciting?
Did the doctor say what it's going to be?
It's going to be a baby.
No.
I mean, I wonder if it's going to be a boy or a girl.
Oh, I can't wait to find out whether I'm going to be a godmother or a godfather.
Wait till I tell Fred.
He's going to be so excited!
Oh, Ethel, Ethel, don't tell Fred.
Why not?
Because I haven't told Ricky yet, and he'd feel awful if Fred knew before he did.
Why haven't you told Ricky?
Well because I-I want to tell him in a very special way.
All my life, I've dreamed about how I was going to tell my husband when we were going to have a baby.
I've known exactly what I was going to say to him.
I've dreamed about it a million times.
Aw Now it's going to come true.
See, h-he'll be sitting right here, see?
And then and then I-I'll come over, and I'll I'll sit on his lap.
And I'll put my arms around his neck, and I'll say Ricky darling our dream has come true.
You and I are going to be blessed with something that means more to us than anything in the whole world.
Well, I shouldn't be here at a time like this.
What?
Uh I mean, I'll come back after you've told Ricky.
Oh, he ought to be home for lunch any minute.
He's going to be so thrilled!
Oh, Lucy!
Oh!
Hi, honey.
Oh, hello, Ricky.
Uh, I thought you'd never get here.
What are you talking about?
I'm ten minutes early.
Oh, yeah.
H- How's everything, darling?
Everything's terrible.
Oh, good.
Good?
I said everything was terrible.
Huh?
Oh, terrible.
Yeah, terrible.
I don't think I'll ever put on another nightclub show as long as I live.
The lights are all wrong.
The costumes are all wrong.
Nobody knows their number.
Nothing good happened today.
Well, it will, dear.
You come over here and sit down.
See?
I fixed lunch in here.
It's cozier and comfyer.
Oh, gee, honey, that looks wonderful.
Yeah, well, just relax, dear.
I'm all right, honey.
I'm just hungry.
Sit back, dear.
Sit back.
Yes, dear.
Ricky Ricky, darling What is it, honey?
Give me that.
Now, swallow.
There.
Ricky, do you have to eat now?
Well, honey, it's lunchtime.
You fixed me a beautiful lunch.
Well, stop for a minute.
Now, swallow that.
My stomach is going to think I lost my teeth.
All right, honey.
Now, what is it?
Ricky darling  Honey, the phone is ringing.
I know it.
Well, honey, one of us has to get up and answer it.
No!
Lucy Let it ring.
Oh, honey, come on.
It might be important, honey.
Oh Come on, sweetheart.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Marco.
What?
!
What do you mean, they can't have the costumes there till tonight?
Now, look, you tell that guy that he has to have those costumes there by 2:00 this afternoon or I'm going to sue him.
That's what I said- I'm going to sue him.
And-and look, will you have the orchestra there on time for a change?
I don't care how you do it.
Just get 'em there, eh?
Thanks.
Good-bye.
Oh, what a business.
Sometimes I think I'll go back to Cuba and work in a sugar plantation.
Just the two of us.
Just the two of us?
Yeah.
I don't mind to get you all involved in my affairs, honey, but you should be happy you're a woman.
Oh, I am, I am.
Oh, you-you think that you know how tough my job is, but believe me, if you traded places with me, you'd be surprised.
Believe me, if I traded places with you, you'd be surprised.
Uh, honey, what is this all about, huh?
What's the matter?
Nothing, dear.
I just love you, that's all.
Uh-oh.
How much are you overdrawn?
I am not overdrawn.
I want to tell you something.
Lucy, what did you buy?
Nothing!
Ricky darling  Oh, I'll get it.
Who was that?
Nobody.
Now, how can nobody ring the doorbell?
Well, I think it was probably Nobody's necktie is caught in the door.
I'll get it.
Nah, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
I'll get it.
Whose father got It's Ricky.
Hi, Ricky.
Hi, Rick.
Now, what's going on here?
Why'd you slam the door in their face?
Well, I  Oh, that's all right.
I- I don't think you should be disturbed while you're eating your lunch.
No, Ricky, go ahead and have your lunch.
We can come back.
We can come back later.
Oh, come on, will you?
!
Come in.
Why everybody acting so silly?
Now, come on and sit down.
I want to talk to you.
Come on.
Come on, will you?
Sit down, Fred.
All right.
Fred, I want to tell you something.
You don't know how smart you are that you got out of show business.
Oh?
You should have been at the club today.
Everything went wrong.
First of all, you know that costume shop and not only that, but the guy in the spotlight has the nerve to tell me that I told him not to light me during my number but to go around looking for interesting faces in the audience.
: Oh, no.
Yeah, well, do you folks really have to go?
Oh, yes, we really do.
Yeah, I guess.
We'll see you later, Ricky.
Come on, Fred.
Yeah, okay.
Good-bye.
Hey, Fred, how about the fights?
Everything's all right.
I've taken care of it, Rick.
I told Honey, he was still talking.
Honey Honey, I-I want to talk to you.
Lucy, what do you sit on when I'm not home?
Ricky darling  Darn that thing!
Lucy, you're sure acting strange.
What's the matter, honey?
Come on, let me answer the phone.
Maybe it's important.
Oh Hello?
Yeah, yeah.
What?
!
What do you mean?
Of course the club has an automatic dishwashing machine.
We just put it in.
What?
!
I got to pay for standby dishwashers?
Aw, now, wait a minute.
No-no-no, d-don't do anything, would you?
I'll be right down.
Just hold everything.
I'll be right down.
Good-bye.
But Ricky, can't you stay a few more minutes?
Honey, I'm sorry, honey, but this is union trouble I got to take care of.
Standby dishwashers they want, yet.
Thanks for the lunch, honey.
Yeah, but, Ricky, Ricky, I want to talk to you about something.
Well, look, sweetheart, whatever it is, use your own judgment.
Now, if if you think it's a good idea, go ahead with it.
I just saw Ricky leaving.
That didn't take long.
What did he say?
Nothing.
I haven't told him yet.
You haven't?
Why not?
Because I kept being interrupted by telephones, sandwiches, and certain busybodies.
Well, thanks.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.
Oh, that's all right.
You're bound to be a little cranky in your condition.
I am not cranky!
Of course not.
Well, I'm not!
That's right.
Come on.
I'll help you with the dishes.
Fred, what is all that?
Well, I want to get the little fella started off right.
Oh, Fred, for heaven's sake.
Here, Lucy.
For my godson.
Oh gee, thanks, Fred.
Oh, she doesn't want all that junk.
Junk?
Do you realize that that's an honest-to-goodness Yankee ball cap?
Huh!
Junk And wait till you see the name on this.
That's the name of the best ballplayer the Yankees ever had.
Oh.
"Spaulding.
" No, honey, turn it around.
Oh!
"Joe DiMaggio"!
You betcha.
Old Joltin' Joe himself.
Ah, gee, Fred.
I bet these things meant a lot to you.
You shouldn't be giving them to us.
Aw, why not?
There's nothing too good for little Freddie.
Aw  You mean, there's nothing too good for little Ethel.
That baby's name is going to be Fred.
How can they call little Ethel "Fred"?
Oh, now wait a minute.
Just a minute.
We're getting a little ahead of ourselves, aren't we?
The baby won't be here for quite a while, you know.
: That's right.
Yeah, I guess you're right there.
There's plenty of time to name him Fred.
Yeah.
Ah, I bet Ricky was thrilled, huh, Lucy?
She didn't get a chance to tell him.
You didn't?
No.
I'm going down to the club and tell him.
Oh, Lucy, that won't be the way you've always planned it.
Well, I can't help it.
Ricky's got to know.
And if I don't tell Ricky soon, I might as well wait and let the baby tell him.
All right, all right.
All right, fellas.
Let's, uh, let's try "Granada," huh?
You got it in there?
What's the number of that?
And listen, I want to check this mic, too- be sure the balance is right.
Okay, Tony?
Granada Tierra sonada por mi Mi cantar se vuelve gitano cuando es para ti Mi cantar Hecho de fantasia Mi cantar Flor de melancolia Que yo te vengo a Dar   Granada, tierra ensangrentada En carra ventura Mujer que conserva el embrujo de los ojos moros Te sueno rebelde y gitana cubierta de flores Y beso to boca de grana, tu goza manzana Que me habla de amores Granada, manola cantadas en coplas preciosas No tengo otra cosa que darte que un ramo de rosas De rosas de suave fragrancias Que le diera mar a la virgen morena Granada Tu tierra Esta llena de lindas mujeres De sangre Del sol!

Oh, sweet little thing.
Coochie-coochie-coochie- coochie-coochie-coochie-coochie.
Hi, hon Oh, hi.
Hey, what are you doing up so late?
Oh, I've been busy.
It's after 2:00- you got to get your rest.
You're sleeping for two now, you know.
I know, but this is very important.
See, the doctor gave me this book and it's all about infant care, and you have to practice with a doll, so you know everything there is to do before the baby gets here.
Oh.
You have to practice, too.
Really?
Yeah.
Isn't it cute?
Is this, uh little Scott or Pamela Ricardo?
Scott or Pamela Do you really like those names, Ricky?
Now, Lucy!
For weeks we've been going over and over and over thousands of names.
I'm so confused, I don't know what my name is.
Now, last night we decided finally, both of us, that the baby's name is going to be Scott if it's a boy and Pamela if it's a girl.
I know, I know, but I went over those names today, and they just don't go with Ricardo.
All right, then, let's change Ricardo.
That'd be easier.
No.
Now, look, this is nothing to joke about, Ricky.
It's a terrible thing to go through go through life with the wrong name- the poor little baby.
All right, all right.
What are their names now?
Gregory or Joanne.
Good, Gregory or Joanne.
Isn't Gregory a beautiful name?
Yeah, honey, beautiful, uh-huh.
So is Joanne.
Joanne Jo-anne Ricky, do you really think Joanne Gregory or Joanne!
Now, Lucy, I don't care what you name the baby, but we got to get it settled.
Well, I'm not going to settle on just any old thing.
I want the names to be unique and euphonious.
Okay, Unique if it is a boy, and Euphonious if it is a girl.
For your information, those are not names, they're words.
Well, they're the prettiest ones you've mentioned yet.
How about Gregory if it's a boy and and Cynthia if it's a girl?
That's fine, honey.
Still, I always liked the name Philip for a boy.
How about Philip for a boy And Morris if it's a girl?
Oh, Ricky!
Now, honey, forget about the names.
You're gonna go to bed, come on.
No, I'm not, not till we get this settled.
I'll sleep late in the morning.
Lucy, you're going to bed.
No, no, honest, I'll go back to bed right after I get your breakfast.
You're not going to get my breakfast.
Who is?
I am, and what's more, I'm going to get your breakfast, too.
Oh, really?
Absolutely.
There's nothing too good for the mother of my child.
: Oh, honey!
Come on, honey, you got to take it easy.
Now, come on, you got to go to bed.
Come on.
Okay.
Oh, Ricky!
I've got the perfect names, something very simple: John or Mary.
That's fine, honey.
John or Mary.
Oh, I'm glad that's settled.
Good.
Ricky?
Ricky?
Good morning, honey.
Good morning.
Just getting ready to cook you breakfast.
Oh, I forgot about that.
Well.
Are you hungry?
Oh, starved.
After all, I'm eating for me and little Romeo or Juliet.
Romeo or Juliet?
Yeah.
Aren't they beautiful names?
What happened to John and Mary?
Well, I got to thinking last night- Mary's all right, but every Tom, Dick and Harry's named John.
All right, I give up.
What do you want for breakfast?
Oh How about waffles?
Oh, no, honey, don't bother.
But you like them so much.
Oh, but they're too much trouble.
Well, won't be any trouble for you.
You just stay right here and take it easy, and I'll take care of everything.
Oh!
I want you to have your favorite breakfast: waffles.
Okay.
I'll have them for you in a jiffy.
All right.
You just stay there and rest now.
I will, dear.
All right.
Lucy?
Yeah?
Where's the waffle iron?
It's in that cabinet under the sink.
Oh.
It's not there, honey.
Are you sure, dear?
Yeah.
Did you look way in the back?
Yeah, I looked all over the place.
Not there.
Well, I must have put it up here.
Hey, honey, wait, wait!
Honey, you can't climb up that.
You're supposed to be resting.
Okay.
I know I saw it around here this morning someplace.
Ricky!
Oh, there it is!
Yeah.
What are you trying to do, start a fire?
Honey, I didn't even see it.
I just plugged the coffeepot Oh.
Well, uh, you go on to bed.
I'll fix you waffles.
Okay.
Lucy?
Yeah?
Where's the waffle mix?
It's in that cupboard with the flour and the cereals.
I know, honey, it isn't there.
Are you sure?
Yeah, honey, I looked all over the place.
You looked up in here behind the cans?
I looked up in there and every place, it's not there.
Well, I don't know where else it could be.
What's this?
Oh, waffle mix.
Yeah.
How did that get there?
Magic.
Lucy?
Where's the salt?
Ricky, do me a favor, will you?
Don't cook breakfast for me this morning.
I'm not strong enough.
Hi, Rick.
Oh, hiya, Fred.
What're you doing?
Well, I was I was cooking breakfast for Lucy.
Attaboy, we got to take care of Lucy and little Fred.
Well, uh, don't count on the baby being called Fred.
She's changed her mind every three seconds.
Naturally.
That's because she's gonna have a baby.
Do they all act that way?
Of course.
Expectant mothers are the most unpredictable creatures in the world.
Yeah, well, Lucy sure is.
You know, I got up this morning and I offered to cook her waffles.
And then suddenly, for no reason at all, she said she doesn't want me to cook her breakfast.
Oh?
I'm telling you, being an expectant father is pretty tough on a man.
Yeah, but you got to go along with it.
Sure.
In a minute or so, she'll probably say that she wants breakfast.
So, I'll just forget her unpredictable behavior and turn the other chick.
Chick?
Yeah.
Is that what you're having for breakfast?
Chick, chick- the outside of your face.
Oh cheek!
That's what I said.
You want to help me?
Sure, I'll help you.
Get me some milk and some eggs there, will you?
Sure.
Lucy?
Hi.
Hi!
Having breakfast in bed!
Yeah.
Ricky and Fred cooked waffles for me this morning.
They did?
How were they?
Well, I don't know.
You want to try one?
How could they serve you a thing like that?
They said this one turned out better than the others.
Oh, no.
Yeah, they explained that the charcoal would be good for the baby's teeth.
I suppose they left a few dishes in the kitchen.
Come on, let's see.
Okay.
Oh, Lucy!
Now, you think they'd get one good waffle out of all this.
Oh, well.
I'll help you clean it up.
Whoo!
Ho, hum.
This is a fine way for you to rest.
Oh, I really don't mind.
Ricky meant well.
It's just the idea that counts.
Yeah.
This shows how much he loves me.
You know, it's amazing the way he fusses over me and takes care of me since we've been expecting the baby.
Well, that's one thing you can be sure of.
Ricky really loves you all right.
Yeah.
Ethel.
What?
Now that I think of it, he never treated me this nice when it was just me.
What do you mean?
It's just the baby he loves.
Oh, don't be silly.
It is, it's little Sharon or Pierrepont.
That's all that counts.
Oh, Lucy, you're just being crazy.
I am not.
You are, too.
He's only taking care of me because of the baby.
He doesn't love me.
Now, Lucy I don't count at all.
After the baby's born, I'll just be forgotten.
Oh, that's not true.
It is so true.
I'll be just like a salmon.
I'll swim upstream, spawn, and never be heard from again!
ETHEL : Ricky?
Ricky?
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Where have you been?
I've been trying to get hold of you all afternoon.
Oh, I was out shopping all day.
I brought Lucy some presents.
Lucy?
Oh, thank goodness for that.
Why, what's the matter?
She's been moping around all day.
She's got a crazy idea that instead of being Hi, honey.
: Hello.
I- I-I brought some presents for you.
For me?
Yeah.
Here, honey.
Open that one.
Just what I've always wanted.
It's a rattle.
Yeah.
Here, honey, open that one.
Does this do anything for me, Ethel?
Now, Lucy.
Honey, it's for the baby.
Oh, yes, of course.
I should've rea Oh, oh, then, these are for me.
No, no, honey, those are for the baby, too.
You don't seem to get the idea.
I get the idea all right.
Thanks for the presents.
Well, now, what's the matter?
I can't figure her out these days.
She's upset; she thinks all you care about is the baby and that you don't love her anymore.
Why, that's ridiculous.
Only this morning I fixed her breakfast in bed.
That's because she's gonna have a baby.
She wants you to do something for her.
What do you mean?
Well, why don't you take her out for an evening?
Take her dining, take her dancing.
Dancing?
In her condition?
Sure.
Why not?
Well, all right, if you think it's the thing to do.
Sure, I'd love to take her out dining and dancing.
I'll take her down to the club tonight.
Oh, that's great.
Uh, why don't you take another couple along?
You know, just to make it a real happy foursome?
Anyone special you have in mind?
We'd love to.
Lucy?
Yeah?
This just came for you.
For me?
It looks like a corsage.
Sure, open it.
Oh, Ethel, look!
It's an orchid.
Oh, isn't it beautiful?
Listen to this: "My darling, no flower I could send would be half as lovely as you.
" I wonder who it's from.
Isn't it signed?
Yeah, it says Ricky, but Ricky who?
Ricky Ricardo.
Oh.
Well, then it must be for the baby.
Now, Lucy, stop being silly.
You know this is for you.
For little old me?
I mean, little old big me?
Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes?
A package for you.
Thank you.
Ethel, look, candy!
Oh, boy.
"Darling, sweets to the sweet.
Devotedly, lover boy.
" Aw, isn't that cute?
I wonder who this is from.
Now, Lucy Well, I suppose it's from Ricky.
You know darn well it is.
Well, it could be from somebody else, you know, except that I happen to recognize his handwriting, and I don't know any other lover boy.
Hello?
Hello, sweetheart.
How's my beautiful girl?
Uh what number were you calling, please?
Lucy, this is me- lover boy.
Who is it?
Who is it?
It's the same crazy fool that sent the flowers and candy.
What were you calling about, please?
I just miss you, that's all.
Do you?
Yeah.
I want to talk to you.
How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
How are you?
Fine, honey.
Listen, I hate to think of not seeing you tonight.
So, why don't you come down to the club and have dinner with me, huh?
He wants me to come down to the club and have dinner with him.
Oh, I'd love to, dear.
Good.
I'll get a nice ringside table and you can stay afterwards and we can dance for a while.
And dancing afterward.
Oh, that would be wonderful, darling.
Good.
You want to ask Fred and Ethel to be with us?
Okay.
Ethel We'd love to.
You'd love to what?
I haven't asked you anything yet.
Oh, uh, well, uh, what were you going to ask me?
Would you like to go with us?
Yes, we'd love to.
They'd love to.
Good.
I'll see you around 8:00, huh?
All right.
Good-bye, angel.
Good-bye, sweetheart.
I love you.
He loves me.
Me!
Oh, isn't this fun?
I haven't been dancing in ages.
Oh, we ought to do this more often.
Oh, boy, I love to dance, but I haven't danced in a while.
I'm a little out of condition.
A little out of condition?
He puffs so much, it's like dancing with a steam engine.
Steam engines always puff when they're pushing a heavy load.
Is that so?
Now, listen, Fred Now, now, now, wait a minute, you two, no bickering.
I'm having a wonderful time.
I don't want anything to spoil this evening.
We're not bickering, that's how we make love.
Lucy, this is our dance.
Oh, do you mind, Ethel?
No.
Go ahead, trip the heavy fantastic.
Ethel I got to hand it to you.
You sure were right.
Yeah.
All she wanted was a little attention.
She's so happy.
Yeah.
Listen.
Do you think Fred will mind if I cut in on him?
This is our favorite number.
No, go ahead.
May I?
Heaven I'm in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak And I seem to find the happiness I seek When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek Heaven I'm in heaven And the cares that hung around me Through the week Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek Oh, I love to climb a mountain And to reach the highest peak But it doesn't thrill me half as much As dancing cheek to cheek Oh, I love to go out fishing On a river or a creek Yeah, man!
I don't enjoy it half as much As dancing cheek to cheek Dance with me I want my arms around you The charm about you Will carry me through Heaven I'm in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak And I seem to find the happiness I seek When we're out together dancing Cheek to cheek.
Oh, isn't this fun?
You were the handsomest couple on the floor.
Well, that's because I was dancing with my lovely wife.
Honey, what's the matter?
Oh, she's crying 'cause she's so happy.
Are you?
No.
Honey, what's wrong?
You haven't mentioned the baby once tonight.
You don't love little Robert or Madelyn.

Okay, now, let's see, what else do we need?
Barbershop quartet.
Okay.
Hi, Rick.
Oh, hi.
A barbershop quartet- yeah, that's right.
Listen, uh how much will that cost?
What?
!
Look, I only want a quartet.
I don't want the whole Metropolitan Opera Company.
Look, I don't want you to think that I'm a tight skate.
: Tight skate.
Cheap wad.
Well, you know what I'm talking about.
All right, well, look, they're only singers.
See if you can get them to work cheaper than that.
Okay, good-bye.
Hey, Rick, you looking for singers?
Good ones that'll work cheap?
Yeah, I'm putting on a new show.
If I'd known what I was getting into, I would have never  Ta-da!
Oh, no.
Presenting Those incomparable exponents of mellifluous melody Heartwarming harmony And appropriate terpsichore  The Merry Mertzes.
Now look, Fred, Ethel Oh, come on, now, Ricky, you used us once, and we were good, remember?
Yeah!
Oh, nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina In the mo-wo-worning No one could be sweeter than my sweetie when I meet her In the mo-wo-worning All right, all right, hold it, hold it.
I must admit, you were pretty good.
I'll see if I can find a spot for you in the show.
You come down to rehearsal tomorrow and I'll give you an audition.
Oh, fine!
What kind of a show is it going to be?
It's going to be a gay '90s revue.
That ought to be fun.
Great.
You know, we didn't have the gay '90s in Cuba like you did over here.
What were they like, Fred?
I don't know.
That was before my time.
Ask Ethel.
We shouldn't be talking about a new show.
Lucy might hear us.
So what?
In her condition, she wouldn't want to be in the show.
She wouldn't?
Of course not.
Oh, I can understand that.
Her figure has changed quite a bit, you know.
Sure.
While strolling through the park one day In the merry, merry month of May I was taken by surprise By a pair of roguish eyes And you can put that parasol away, bom, bom.
Now, Ricky, if Fred and Ethel are going to be in your show, there's no reason why I can't be in it, too.
Now, look, wait a minute.
In the first place, I have not definitely promised Fred and Ethel that they're going to be in the show.
And in the second place, I can definitely promise you that you're not going to be in it.
But Ricky You're going to have a baby, remember?
Of course I remember.
That's just the point.
After I have the baby, I'll have to stay home and take care of it.
I'll never be able to be in a show again.
Hey, I never thought about it that way.
Sure, it'll sort of be my show business farewell.
My show business swan song.
Lucy, the answer is no.
Would you begrudge an expectant swan her song?
You seem to forget that this particular swan has no talent.
Oh, no?
What time is that rehearsal tomorrow?
You're not going to be there, so just forget it.
No?
No, I said no, I'm not going to be there.
Sir, you dare not strike a mother.
Lucy?
I'm in the closet, Ethel, trying to find a costume for my audition today.
Oh, no, Lucy, you're not really going to go down there and audition, are you?
I certainly am.
Trying to find a costume that won't be too revealing.
How's this?
Well, I guess that's not too revealing.
What number are you going to do?
Oh, I never thought about that.
I could sing "Roll Out the Barrel.
" You could, but it's not a gay '90s song.
Oh.
How about "Put On Your Old Gray Barrel"?
"I'm Only a Bird in a Gilded " No?
No.
Oh, well, I guess you're right.
This won't work.
Hey, where'd everybody go?
Don't stand there laughing, get me out me out of this thing.
I can't move.
Okay.
Hello, down there.
Hello.
Move up a little.
Oh, ow, uh.
Guess I'll have to find something else that'll do the trick.
Say!
How about that horse costume that Ricky's got?
That's a wonderful idea, you know, we can both Now, wait just a minute, forget I ever said it.
If you dress as half a horse, I know who'll be the other half and no, thanks.
Oh, I know.
I know.
Oh, sure, these ought to do it.
How will I look in these?
What are you going as, a lamb chop?
There's an old fashioned hoop skirt that goes with this.
We can work up a cute song and dance number.
I hope you're not thinking of me as part of "we.
" Sure.
We'll be a couple.
A couple of what?
I'll be the woman and you be the man.
Good-bye, Lucy.
Aw, now, Ethel, are you going to desert me in my hour of need?
Yes.
Ethel, you who would like to be the godmother of my child.
Oh but why me?
Why can't you be the man?
Well, that should be fairly obvious.
Oh, all right.
But I have a feeling I'd be better off if I'd settled for the back end of that horse.
Pepito, haven't you got your costume on yet?
Yes, start my music.
Okay, here we go, music.

What act?

I didn't ask for any Mack or McGillicuddy- McGillicuddy and Mertz?

Hi, Lucy.
What do you want?
Oh, for goodness' sake, you're still mad.
I am not mad!
Well, then you got a new way of acting happy.
Well, how do you expect me to act when my own husband won't let me be in his show?
Oh, now, Lucy, it's his show.
He's got a right to hire whoever he wants.
Yeah, what a flimsy excuse he gave us.
You mean telling us we stank?
Now, you know he didn't mean that.
He just said it because I'm expecting a baby and he doesn't want me to be in the show.
Makes me so mad.
Well, if it'll make you feel any better, he couldn't find a place for Fred and me either.
Some showman he is.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi.
Hiya, honey.
Huh?
Boo!
Oh, Lucy, are you still mad at me on account of this afternoon?
I'm not talking to you.
Well, look, I'm awfully sorry if I could not find a place for you in the show.
But there is no place for a gay '90s striptease.
Very funny.
Oh, you're a sorehead.
Oh, now, Ricky, it's her condition.
It is not my condition!
I was a sorehead long before I ever thought about That's not what I meant.
Hi, Rick.
Oh, hiya, Fred.
Listen, Fred, uh, I might find a place for you in the barbershop quartet.
Oh, good.
Nobody sings barbershop any better than I do.
Oh, good night, ladies, good night, ladies Good night, ladies We're going to leave you now Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along Merrily we roll along O'er the deep blue sea.
Hey, that sounds pretty good!
It's too bad you're not a man, Ethel.
Oh, I can wear a wig and a handlebar mustache.
I dressed up like a man this afternoon.
You just heard her sing that harmony.
Oh, come on, Ricky.
Say yes.
Well, we might be able to work it out.
What do you think of this idea?
I thought that the three of us could be barbers and then the fourth guy could be the customer in the chair.
Hey, that's cute.
Yeah, that's a great idea.
It'll be the first time I ever heard a Cuban sing barbershop.
Well yeah.
A Cuban singing barbershop.
That wouldn't sound so right, would it?
I'll tell you what I'll do- I'll sing it with an Irish accent.
Oh, this I got to hear.
Now, wait a minute.
I'll practice, you'll be surprised.
That's for sure.
Oh!
Who's going to play the fourth guy, Ricky?
Good night, ladies Good night, ladies Good night.
Now, Ricky Now, honey, please.
Now, look, it would just be perfect.
I can be the fourth guy in the chair with a sheet over me.
You seem to overlook one little minor detail.
You can't sing.
I sang this afternoon.
Look, honey, we're singing "Sweet Adeline.
" We're singing harmony, everybody sings something different.
Well, then, that's just perfect.
If everybody's singing something different, it won't matter what note I hit.
It doesn't work quite that way.
Besides, I practically offered the job to George Watson.
Oh, George Watson.
You haven't even given me a chance.
Now, Ricky, couldn't Lucy just sing the first part?
You know, Sweet Adeline And then we could come in on the second part.
Of course.
Just give me a chance.
Yeah.
Give her a chance.
Come on.
Hit the notes for us.
Okay.
That's me.
Lucy?
Bravo, bravo!
She made it!
All right, all right, you start all by yourself now.
Give her the chord.
: Sweet Adeline.
Well, it's a little difficult to start all by yourself just out of nowhere.
All right, we'll try it the other way.
What other way?
We'll sing the first phrase and you come in with the repeats.
Repeats?
Yeah.
We'll sing, "Sweet Adeline," and you sing, "Sweet Adeline, my Adeline.
" "My Adeline.
" "Sweet Adeline, sweet Adeline, my Adeline," okay.
All right.
Now, you better stand away from us so you won't be thrown off by anybody singing harmony in your ear.
All right?
Go.
All right, go ahead.
Hit it.
: Sweet Adeline : Sweet Adeline Well, I guess I'm standing a little close, it threw me off.
Try it again.
My Adeline : My Adeline At night, dear heart : At night, dear heart For you I pine In all my dreams In all my dreams In all my dreams?
George Watson, huh?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the finale of our show, something that a gay '90s revue cannot be without: A barbershop quartet.
So, here it is, a quartet composed of Mertz, Mertz, Watson and Ricardo, with their version of "Sweet Adeline.
"  In the evening when I sit alone a- dreaming Of days gone by, love  To me so dear There's a picture that in fancy oft' appearing Brings back the time, love When you were near It is then I wonder where you are, me darling And if your heart to me is still the same For the sighing wind and nightingale a- singing Are breathing only Your own sweet name ETHEL AND  Your own sweet name  Sweet Adeline : Sweet Ad- My Adeline My Ad- At night, dear heart At- For you I pine Pi- In all my dreams In all- Your fair face beams You're the flower Of my heart Sweet Adeline  Sweet Adeline.
Lucy and Desi will be back in a moment.
Fred!
Merry Christmas!
Lucy!
We're all Santa Clauses!
Yeah!
How about that?
Let's put our presents under the tree.
Okay, okay.
Here we go.
All right.
Whoo!
Hey, Santa, you put on a little weight, didn't you?
Ha-ha!
How about you?
Yeah!
How about you, Ethel?
Fred, where'd you ever buy such a big pillow?
Huh?
Why don't you answer me?
I'm not wearing a pillow.
Come on, let's open all our presents.
All right.
Okay!
Oh, no, no!
Let's sing first?
Sing?
Well, yeah.
Everything is so wonderful and spending Christmas with our good friends, I just feel like serenading the world.
Okay!
I know a wonderful Cuban melody.
It's called "Cascabeles.
"  Let's hear it!
Go ahead!
Sing it!
All right.
Cascabeles, cascabeles Cantan todo el dÃ­a Cascabeles, cascabeles Traen la alegria Hey, that's "Jingle Bells.
" "Jingle Bells"?
Sure!
How about that?
You Americans steal all our good songs.
Ha-ha!
Hey, let's all sing it, huh, Santa Clauses?
All right.
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse, open sleigh Jingle Bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one horse, open sleigh Dashing through the snow In a once horse, open sleigh O'er the fields we go Laughing all the way Bells on bobtail ring Making spirits bright What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight Oh, Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse, open sleigh Jingle Bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one horse, open sleigh.

Oh, honey, where have you been?
What took you so long?
What do you mean, what took me so long?
I had to go all over town.
There's only one store in New York City that makes a papaya juice milkshake.
Oh, thank you.
Mmm Oh Did you get the dill pickle?
Lucy, are you sure that you want to?
That's right.
Mmm Ricky?
Yes, dear.
Honey, I never asked you this before, but what do you hope the baby's going to be, a boy or a girl?
You're going to be disappointed if it isn't a boy, aren't you?
Oh, no, honey, don't be silly.
You will, too.
Every man wants a little boy so he can see himself running around.
Well, I don't particularly.
If it's a boy, I'll be happy, and if it's a girl I'll be happy, too.
I really don't care.
Well, that's good.
How do you feel about it, honey?
I guess every woman wants a little girl so she can dress her up fancy and fuss over her and teach her how to catch a man.
Well, maybe most women do, but I feel just the way you do, Ricky.
I don't care, boy or girl, doesn't make any difference.
Oh, that's good.
Here, honey.
Thank you.
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.
Oh, honey, what's in the package?
Oh, honey, nothing, nothing.
Oh, it was a surprise for me.
Well Well, it's spoiled now.
I might just as well open it.
But I don't want you So you have no preference, huh?
Well, that doesn't mean anything.
Lots of little girls play football, too, you know.
What are you going to name her, Rocky Ricardo?
Come on, now.
Let's see what other feminine frills we have here.
Havana U., 1974.
So it doesn't make any difference to you, boy or girl, no preference, doesn't matter.
All right, all right, so I'd rather have a boy.
Is that so terrible?
Now, give me the stuff, come on.
Oh, honey, now, don't get mad.
No, come on, you're making fun of me.
Aw, come on.
Sit down, honey.
Come on, sit down, baby, come on, now.
Well If you dress my son in this, he'll need those boxing gloves.
Well, I guess it's true.
Women want girls and men want boys.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Havana U.?
What?
You mean you want our child to go to Havana University?
Certainly.
Havana U., my old alma mater.
Oh, wouldn't that be wonderful?
Just think of it.
Our son.
Or daughter.
Walking the very same campus where I used to walk.
And one day, after Havana wins the big game and holds the jai alai pennant, we'll stand together and sing: Arriba, arriba por Havana U. No hay nadie en el mundo que sea como tu Rah, rah, viva, rah, rah, rah Havana, Havana U., ole!
Yeah, well, that's fine, dear, from your point of you, but gee, I don't know, Havana?
What's the matter with Havana?
Well, nothing, but we have a couple little red schoolhouses in this country, too, you know.
Well, honey, let's not worry about it.
The main thing is that our child will go to college.
Yeah.
You know, I've been giving this a lot of thought, Ricky.
It's a big responsibility having a baby and bringing up a child.
You know all the questions they ask.
You have to give them a right answer, too.
Gee, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do it.
Oh, honey, sure you will.
Well, I don't know.
You know the kind of questions children ask.
Suppose our child asks something simple like, "Mommy, where does rain come from"?
"Where does rain come from?
"Well, I don't know, dear.
Your mommy's a dumbbell.
" Oh, honey, you're just being ridiculous.
I am not.
Of course, there's always one good answer: "Ask your daddy, dear.
He can explain it better than I can.
" "Daddy, where does rain come from"?
Well, dear, it's very simple.
You see, the water Well, first of all, there are the clouds, see.
And the clo The moisture in the air See what I mean?
We have to do something about this.
Oh, honey, you're just exaggerating the whole thing.
I am not.
And I'm going to start studying right now.
When I get through, I want my child to think that its mother is a walking book of knowledge.
Hi, honey.
Good evening.
Oh, when you get started on something, you really go through with it, don't you?
Oh, boy, am I pooped.
Well, this is indeed distressing news.
To what do you attribute your plethora of fatigue?
The enervating activities of your nocturnal occupation?
What?
I said, this is indeed distressing news.
To what do you attribute your plethora of fatigue?
I heard you the first time, but what language is it?
It's the language I want our child to learn: good English.
That's English?
Yes.
Funny thing- when it's spoken correctly, you don't even recognize it, do you?
You know, I had no idea how sloppy my speech was until I started reading this book.
Oh, brother.
No, really, it's true.
But they have a wonderful exercise to correct it.
"How do you do, Mrs. Smith?
"How do you do, Mrs. Jones?
"And how are all your adorable children?
"Quite well, thank you.
"And how is your sister Cynthia?
Sister Cynthia is simply scintillating.
" Now, Lucy, you're not going to teach our child to talk that way, are you?
I certainly am.
From the time our child is born, it's not going to hear anything but perfect English.
Well, honey, it's a very nice thought, but as usual you have no logical 'splanation for doin' it the way you're doin' it.
What did you say?
You heard what I said.
"As usual, there's no logical 'splanation for doin' it the way you're doin' it.
" Ricky, promise me something.
What?
Promise me that until our child is at least 19 or 20 years old, you won't talk to it.
What?
What's the matter with the way I talk?
Well, I haven't told you this before, dear, but you speak with a slight accent.
You can understand me, can't you?
Well, now, yes.
I've learned to listen with an accent.
But when we first started going together, it was just Well, do you remember when you proposed?
Yeah.
Well, it was a stab in the dark when when I said yes.
I wasn't sure that you'd asked me to get married or go to a movie.
Do you mean to tell me that I could have gotten out of this whole deal by just taking you to a movie?
Ricky Ricardo.
Here, honey, I'll show you what I mean.
Now, you take this book and pretend that our child has come to you and said, "Daddy, read me a good-night story.
" All right.
There you are, Daddy.
"Once upon a time in the woods live a peasant.
"He was a good man with a noble heart.
"He spent his time in the forest cutting down booges from the trees.
" "Cutting wood " Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, just a minute.
What is this "booges"?
"Booges," right in there.
That's "boughs.
" B- O-U-G-H is "bough"?
Right.
Bough.
"He spent his time in the forest cutting down boughs "from the trees.
"Cutting wood all day made his hands strong and row.
One day " That's "rough.
" Spelled the same way as the other: O- U-G-H.
That's right.
That shows how little you know about the English language.
So I made a little mistake.
"Made his hands strong and rough.
"One day he cut wood so fast that by "his day's work was thruff.
When the " Hold it, Shakespeare.
Thraugh?
T- h-r-o-u-g-h is pronounced "through.
" Through, that's what I always say.
Now, stop picking on me, will you?
You're getting me all confuse.
"His day's work was through.
"It started to rain on the way home, "and he got so wet that his nose became red and he developed a hacking " "coo"?
Well, I know it can't be "cow.
" It's "cough.
" Oh, that did it.
I had enough.
Or should I say "enu"?
No, enough.
Enough.
I don't see why you have to have such a crazy language anyway.
In Spanish you don't have all those "ow," "oh," "oo," "off," "oof" sounds.
In Spanish, you got a sound, it sounds the same all the time.
You write it the same way, it sounds the same way.
No matter where you put it, it comes out the same way.
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.
I tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna teach our child to speak Spanish.
Spanish!
That's right.
And what's more, I don't want you to talk to the kid until he's 21 years old.
Our child is going to learn to speak English, but first we have to learn.
We're going to hire a tutor.
A tutor?
That's right.
And you and I and Fred and Ethel will take lessons.
Fred and Ethel?
How did they get into the act?
Well, they're gonna be around here a lot, and I want anyone who's gonna converse with my child to speak perfect English.
Now, Lucy, that is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard Now, honey, my mind is made up I had enough trouble learning how to speak American.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi.
Is the tutor here yet?
No, not yet.
He ought to be here any minute.
I'm fixing the classroom, see?
Oh!
Say, Lucy, aren't tutors awful expensive?
How did you get Ricky to agree to pay for one?
I didn't.
I told him it wouldn't cost him a cent.
Huh?
Well, you see, when Mr. Livermore called me, he just happened to mention that he would be interested  Lucy!
Yeah, dear?
Are the Mertzes here yet?
Ethel's here.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi.
Where's Fred?
Isn't he coming?
Yeah, he's coming all right, but he kicked like a steer.
Well, is he coming?
Look, if Fred doesn't come, I don't want to He'll be here, Ricky.
He had on dirty overalls, and I made him change his clothes.
That must be Mr. Livermore now.
School days, school days, dear old golden rule days Reading and writing and 'rithmetic  Taught to the tune of a hickory stick You were my bashful barefoot beau Wrote on my slate, "I love you, Joe" Fred Mertz!
Oh, Fred, that's wonderful.
What do you think you're doing?
Now, you two stop.
This is serious.
All right, Buster Brown, go downstairs and get out of that silly outfit.
All right, all right!
See you at recess, Rick.
Last one to the teeter-totter's a rotten egg.
I was your queen in calico You were my bashful barefoot beau Why-ay-ay How do you do?
Are you Mister I'm Mr. Livermore.
Oh, come in, please.
Please.
I- I'm Mrs. Ricardo.
Charmed.
Pleased to meetcha.
Meetcha?
The phrase is "meet you.
" Meet you.
Meet I'm glad to meet you.
Meet you.
Uh, I'd like you to meet your other pupils.
This is Mrs. Mertz.
Howdja do?
Are you, by any chance, endeavoring to pronounce "How do you do"?
Yeah- uh, yes.
Uh, and this is Fred Mertz.
Howdja do?
You see, Mrs. Mertz, you've transmitted your bad enunciation to your son here.
Ow, you hurt me, Mommy.
Oh, behave yourself.
He isn't my son.
He's my husband.
My word.
Either way, it presents an appalling prospect.
You don't understand, Mr. Livermore.
You see, Fred is dressed like that because he's going back to school.
It's his idea of a little joke.
Oh?
Uh, this is my husband, Ricky Ricardo.
It is a great pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mr. Ricardo.
Hi.
I just want you to know that the only reason I'm only doing this is to keep her happy because she's going to have a baby in February.
But to tell you the truth, this whole thing is ridiculous to me, and the whole routine, I don't want any part of it.
What did he say?
Well, he was just trying to What's the matter with you?
Don't you understand English?
We'd better get started immediately.
There's more to do here than I thought.
Places, everybody.
Is he making fun of me?
No.

Shush!
Attention, class.
Inasmuch as we are faced here with a state of emergency, I will dispense with the traditional oath of allegiance and good-morning song.

Ah, eh, ee, oh, ooh.
Mr. Ricardo, wherever did you acquire that odd pronunciation?
I went to school in Cuba.
What's your 'scuse?
Ricky, apologize!
Apologize!
Okay, okay, I'm No, no, just a moment.
Did you say "okay"?
Yeah.
We must rid our speech of slang.
Now, besides "okay," I want you all to promise me that there are two words that you will never use.
One of these is "swell" and the other one is "lousy.
" Okay, what are they?
One of them is "swell" and the other one is "lousy.
" Well, give us the lousy one first.
I don't believe you quite understand.
Don't bother to explain, Mr. Livermore.
Just tell us what the words are and we won't use them.
No.
But don't you see?
The word Well, the other May I have a glass of water, please?
Okay.
I- I mean yes.
Would you help me, Ethel, get a pitcher and some glasses?
Yes.
I would say "okay.
" That's a swell way to get off to a lousy start.
Mr. Ricardo, perhaps this would be a good time to discuss our song.
Our song?
Well, at least my song.
You see, I'm referring to the business deal your wife and I made.
Don't you understand?
In lieu of the remuneration for my tutelage, I am to be permitted to introduce my talents into your nocturnal bistro.
Hey, hey, I think I got it, Rick.
Instead of you paying him, this guy's gonna sing in your nightclub.
Yes.
You want to sing at the Tropicana?
Thank you, I'd love to.

Hold it.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I don't know what Ricky, what's the matter?
What's the matter?
What's going on, dear?
Well, I was singing my little ditty for your husband You mean to tell me that you actually promised this character that he was going to sing at the club?
Yes, isn't it wonderful?
And we're going to get six months' English lessons free.
I don't care we're gonna get English lessons free for the rest of our lives.
He's not gonna sing in my club.
Well!
But, Ricky, that isn't fair.
You haven't even heard the song.
I heard the song.
"Tippy-tippy-toe.
" Ay-yi-yi-yi.
Well, I think you owe Mr. Livermore the courtesy of at least hearing it through once.
Now, after all, it's going to sound a lot better down at the club, with the lights on and all of us singing with him and everything  All of us singing?
!
What do you mean, all of us singing?
Now, just a minute.
He's worked up a very cute little act, he's got it all figured out, and I think the least we could do is listen and I insist that we try it now.
Thank you.
Now, this is the way I start.
Mr. Mertz, please.
I stand here, Mr. and Mrs. Ricardo there, Mr. and Mrs. Mertz there.
And I sing the verse first.
I tippy-tippy-toe through my garden Where all the pretty flowers dwell There's a rare perfume in my garden And I just love to stand there and smell And as Now you come back here.
You come right back here.
You haven't heard the best part yet.
That's obvious, yeah.
Now come on back here, right where you were, all of you.
Go ahead, Mr. Livermore.
Thank you.
And as I tippy-tippy-toe along All the pretty flowers seem to sing this song.
Now, here's where you come in.
Here's one for each.
Ladies first, of course.
Now, you sing when I point to you.
Now I'll sing what I just sang again.
And as I tippy-tippy-toe along All the pretty flowers seem to sing this song Darry-down pip-pip Dilly-dilly day Hey, nonny-nonny Rippity-pippity ay Now comes the cute part.
You begin first this time, Mr. Mertz.

Yeah, I told Lucy that I was going to last night.
See?
Where is Lucy?
She's in the bedroom.
What's the matter with you?
I believe you've finally cracked your Cuban crock.
Look, Fred, will you trust me, huh?
I got a plan, I got it all figured out, and I think it'll work perfect.
I made a deal with Mr. Livermore.
Yes, but I'm afraid I've sullied my principles by accepting your scheme, Mr. Ricardo.
Now, remember, you guaranteed to get me auditions with every record company in town.
Look, you just hold your end of the bargain and I'll take care of mine.
Don't you worry.
Will you please tell me what's going on?
Relax, will you?

Hi, Fred.
Listen, did you call Jim and Morey?
Well, as soon as they get there, bring them up, huh?
Yeah, I'll have the television getting warm and the beer getting cold.
Yeah, we'll watch the game from up here.
What do you mean we'll upset Lucy?
Of course not.
Listen, Fred, there is nothing wrong with Lucy.
She's just having a baby.
Why does everybody treat her like she's falling apart or something?
Okay, I'll see you in a few minutes.
Bye.
Honey!
Why did you take that chair away?
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
I didn't know that was your chair.
What's the big idea?
I want to watch the ball game.
Oh, honey, you can't watch television up here today.
What do you mean I can't?
Fred is coming up with a couple of the guys.
Well, I'm sorry.
The girls are coming over.
They're giving me a baby shower.
Oh, now, honey.
Now, dear, think of the baby.
Think of all the nice things she'll get.
Well, think of me.
I finally get an afternoon off, and I can't even sit in my own home and watch my own television set.
Now, I am thinking of you.
If it wasn't for the baby shower, you'd have to pay for all that loot I'm going to get.
Well, it might be worth it.
Ricky Ricardo, you're jealous of the baby.
Oh, now, honey, don't be silly.
Well, then you go to Fred's and look at the game.
Isn't it nice the girls are giving me a surprise shower?
Surprise?
!
Yeah.
Well, if it's a surprise, how do you know about it?
Well, how do you think?
Every girl in the club called up and told me.
Every girl in the club called up and told you it was going to be a surprise?
Yeah, yeah.
They knew I'd hate it if they came over here to surprise me and the house was a mess, and I had my hair up in curlers.
I want them to surprise me but I don't want them to surprise me.
Yeah, uh-huh.

It was a cinch.
You better run along now.
The girls will be here any minute.
Okay.
Say, uh, what am I supposed to do for lunch?

Did you ever see anything like that in your life?

They're so little!
Look at this that goes with it.
Isn't that cute!
Did you notice these little shirts, Lucy?
Weren't the girls generous, Ethel?
Oh, I'll say they were.
Oh, hi, Ricky.
Look at all the wonderful things the baby and I got.
Oh, gee, that's swell.
Aren't they adorable?
: Oh, yeah Listen, honey, is dinner ready?

That's cute.
Look at this, honey.
Can't you just?
Ooh, isn't that darling?
I'll be right back.
Hey, Rick, did you see today's paper?
No.
You made Winchell's column.
I did?
Yeah!
Ricky, Winchell!
How wonderful!
No kidding!
Yeah, there's a whole item here about you.
Oh, imagine me in Winchell's column.
Yeah.
There it is.
"Carrot-topped Lucy Ricardo, formerly Lucy McGillicuddy "and currently one of show business's most beautiful wives is 'infanticipating.
'" Oh!
Isn't that wonderful?
How about that?
It's a nice article about me, yeah.
You're in there.
You haven't finished it.
Here, read that.
Oh.
Oh.
Her husband is the bandleader.
Oh, that's wonderful, dear.
Let me see.
Look, Ethel.
Uh "Lucy Ricardo  "beautiful " "infanticipating.
" Aw!
We'll have to cut that out and save it.
It's the first time the baby's been mentioned in print.
Hey, you ought to start a scrapbook.
How 'bout dinner, eh?
That's a wonderful idea!
A baby scrapbook.
How 'bout dinner?
I would love that.
I love keeping scrapbooks.
It'll have to be a great big one "Would you like dinner, Ricky?
if it's already made Winchell's column.
"Yeah, I'd love some dinner.
" "What would you like"?
"I would like a nice, big, thick steak; juicy.
" "Would you like some potatoes with it"?
"Yes, please, and put plenty of butter in the potato.
" "How about some onions, Ricky"?
"Oh!
I would like to have some onions.
" All right, all right, all right, I'll fix you something to eat.
Would a nice piece of rare roast beef make you feel better?
And how.
Okay, coming right up.
Okay.
Aw, gee, it was a wonderful shower.
Too bad you fellows couldn't be here.
Well, Ethel, I'd have come,  but I didn't have a thing to wear.
Oh, you, come on downstairs and I'll fix your supper.
Bye, Ricky.
Good-bye.
Would this be rare enough?
Oh, Lucy.
Well, I bought it.
I just forgot to cook it, that's all.
Don't you have anything else?
Uh, yeah, how would you like a nice, thick, juicy, delicious fried egg sandwich.
No?
Well, the surprise shower threw me off schedule.
I had a lot of things to do today, Ricky.
You should see the list of things I had.
Here, look, look at this.
"Buy roast beef.
" Well, congratulations.
Thank you.
"Pick up Ricky's laundry.
" Ew Now, you're not going to tell me that I don't have any clean shirts.
I'm not?
Well, couldn't you stop by the laundry on your way to the club?
"Pick up Ricky's tux at cleaners.
" Well, it's only a couple more blocks to the cleaners.
I better get going.
I got a lot of things to do.
Uh, you don't mind if I borrow your list, do you?
No.
Thanks.
Well, honey, you have to eat.
Let me fix you something.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'll get by.
I'll-I'll-I'll eat.
I'll get something, somehow, somewhere.
It's the doctor, dear.
Good morning, Ricky.
Hiya, Doc.
Now, what seems to be the trouble?
You just tell me all about it.
Uh, well, he was very nauseated this morning.
Oh?
And, uh Nauseated?
Yes, and he has dizzy spells and he has pains in his stomach.
Pains in his stomach.
Uh-huh.
Hmm.
Every few minutes.
It must be something I ate last night.
I see.
Yeah, well, I suppose it's my fault.
I should've gotten you dinner, dear, instead of having that silly shower.
Hmm Yeah.
Hmm, no temperature.
Mrs. Ricardo, do you mind if I talk to your husband alone for a moment?
Oh, not at all.
Is it, is it serious, Doctor?
Is it fatal?
Come on, tell me.
I can take it.
Go ahead.
Tell me, Ricky, have you been feeling neglected lately, since your wife is going to have a baby?
Neglected?
!
No.
Why?
Well Think of all your symptoms.
You say you have morning sickness, right?
Yeah.
Pains in the stomach?
Yeah.
Dizziness?
Yeah.
Don't you see, Ricky?
They're exactly like the symptoms your wife has been having lately.
Oh, now, come on, what are you going to tell me, that I'm going to have a baby?
No, I can definitely assure you you are not going to have a baby.
No kidding.
Now, for this I got to pay you for a house call?
Now, come on, stop joking, will you?
I'm not neglected, I'm sick.
I'm surprised you don't feel neglected.
Why, your wife even said she couldn't fix dinner for you last night because of the baby shower.
So?
That didn't bother me.
Listen, if I wanted to get upset, I got a hundred things to get upset about.
She didn't pick up my laundry.
My suits weren't cleaned.
I come home on an afternoon off, I can't even sit and watch the ball game.
Now, what are you trying to say, that I'm sick because I'm feeling sorry for myself?
Well, not Aw, come on, will you?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard of in my whole life.
I'm sick because I ate something.
It didn't land in the right place.
It gave me a pain.
It made me dizzy.
That's what made me sick.
That's the craziest double-talk I ever heard in my life.
Well, on second thought, maybe I better have another look at you.
Oh Ah Yes, you definitely have ptomaine.
Well, that's more like it.
Hi, Lucy.
Oh, hi.
Did you find out what's the matter with Ricky yet?
No, the doctor's still in there.
Oh, Doctor, what's the matter with him?
Oh, it's nothing serious.
You know, Mrs. Ricardo, sometimes, when a wife is expecting, the, uh, husband develops the same symptoms.
Really?
Well, that seems strange.
Oh, no, no.
It's not unusual.
At a time like this, when everybody's interest centers around the expected child, the husband feels left out, neglected.
Oh, I don't think Ricky feels neglected.
Still, there was that baby shower yesterday.
Yeah, and you forgot to fix dinner for him.
Yeah, and I forgot to pick up his cleaning and his laundry and he did act kind of funny about that, didn't he?
Exactly as I thought.
You know, if there was some way that you could figure out to make your husband the center of attention, I'm sure your troubles would be over.
Oh.
Well, I'll call you later on to see how you're getting on.
Well, thank you, Dr. Rabwin.
Not at all.
Good day, ladies.
Bye.
Oh, my bag.
Now, how am I going to make Ricky the center of attention?
I don't know.
Why don't you give him a baby shower.
Don't try to be funny.
Try to help me.
Hey, you know, that's not such a bad idea, at that: A daddy shower.
Yeah!
We can have the men come and give Ricky presents for the baby.
Who could give it for him?
Fred, who else?
Do you think he would?
He'd love it.
Come on, let's go tell him.
Okay.
What happened?
What'd he say?
Did he like the idea?
He's crazy about it.
You should have seen him perk up when I told him.
He's practically well already.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Here's the list of fellas he wants me to invite.
Oh, Fred, I love you.
Mm!
Thank you!
Wow!
I love you too, Fred.
Well  I hate to leave this little love nest but I'll see you later.
Okay.
Where are you going?
Down to the recreation club.
I've got to make arrangements for our stag party.
Oh.
G'bye.
So long.
Bye.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Oh, gee, won't they have fun?
Yeah.
Stag party?
What happened to the baby shower?
Oh, I guess Fred would feel kind of funny asking men to a baby shower, so he's going to call it a stag party.
Oh.
Stag party, huh?
Well, it's still a baby shower.
It is?
Oh, now, Lucy, don't be silly.
You want Ricky to get well, don't you?
Sure I want him to get well.
But I'd like to know what kind of medicine he's using.
When they call a party "stag," it means only men are allowed.
It does?
Yeah.
Doesn't it?
Well, there's one good way to find out.
How?
What if a couple of uninvited stags showed up?
Uninvited sta?
You mean?
Yeah.
Oh, Lucy!
We could disguise ourselves.
What are you going to go as, an expectant father?
Even if we could disguise ourselves, they know everybody who's going to be there.
Well, now, just leave it to me.
I'll think of something.
Sure.
Yes, sir.
Well, we'll be happy to have you.
Yeah, well, come right over.
Okay, thank you.
Bye.
Hey, Fred?
Yeah?
This is getting to be quite an affair.
Why?
Well, you know who that was on the phone?
No.
It's a reporter.
Yeah.
He wants to bring a photographer over and they want to cover the first daddy shower.
Well, that sounds interesting.
What paper was it?
He didn't say.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we made the society page?
Oh, boy.
I can see it now.
"Fred Mertz poured last night "for Ricky Ricardo and some of his most intimate slobs.
" Well, here's the gang.
Hi!
Congratulations.
Break it up, now, boys.
Break it up.
Now, remember, this is a shower, and let's do it right.
Now, first, everybody put their presents on that table.
All right right over here.
Oh, fellas!
: Oh, gee whiz.
Oh, isn't that?
Look- "From Jerry.
" Oh, yeah.
Oh, Jerry, you didn't have to do it.
Oh, well, it was nothing, Rick.
Just what I always wanted.
Oh, just a little something I thought you could use.
Oh, that's nice.
Well, let's start opening the presents, huh?
Yes?
Is this the Ricardo party?
Yes, I'm Ricky Ricardo.
How do you do?
I'm from the paper.
Press.
Uh, press.
Yeah, press.
I see, yeah, well, what paper are you from?
The New York Times.
The Herald Tribune.
The Herald Tribune.
The New York Times.
Well, actually, it isn't generally known, but, uh, it's the New York Herald Times Tribune.
Isn't that right, Sam?
Yeah, that's right, Pete.
Uh, uh uh, listen, uh, you-you make yourself at home.
Will you, uh, will you pardon me for a minute?
Sure, go ahead, take your shower.
I mean, have your shower.
What are you saving kings for, fella?
Listen, I want you to meet a couple of great guys here.
Jerry, this is Pete.
How are you, Pete?
Sam, this is Fred.
Fred Mertz.
Pete, how are you?
Fred Mertz?
Glad to know you, Fred Mertz.
Uh, this, uh, the boys are from the newspapers.
They're coming over to write about our daddy shower.
Isn't that nice?
Oh, is that right?
Yeah.
Well, uh, what do you like to know?
Well, now, whose idea was this here shower?
Uh, that was mine.
Oh, is that so, Mr. Mertz?
Yes.
I said to my old battle ax, I said "Why should the mother "why should the mothers get all the breaks?
Why don't we do something about the fathers"?
Oh, you said that, huh?
That's what I said, yeah.
You're looking for a story, are you?
I sure am.
Well, I've got a great story for you, Pete.
Oh, well, go ahead.
Yeah!
Of course, you'd never be able to print this in a newspaper, you know.
Tell it, Jerry.
Go on!
All right.
All right.
Well, you see, there was this fella- he was a bachelor, a sort of a man about town, and he goes into this nightclub in Paris.
Ah!
You say this whole thing was your idea, huh, Mr. Mertz?
Just a minute, Pete.
Just a minute, will you?
Just let the young man tell his Yeah, let him tell the story, will you?
Come back here, please?
Let the fella tell it.
Now, one night, he goes into this nightclub, see?
Uh-huh, yeah.
And this beautiful girl, a cancan dancer, Yeah, yeah?
she's doing her act.
Uh-huh.
She's dancing, see?
And this fella walks right up on the stage.
Uh-huh!
She what I mean?
She's dancing, and he's right there in the middle of the stage.
Now, do you get the picture?
Uh, picture.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh Oh!
Where'd he go?
Where'd everybody go?
Hey, hey, this way, this way, Pete.
That you, Sam?
Yeah, that's me.
Come on, right this way.
I'm sorry we have to break this up, fellas, but I guess we'll have to go now.
Well, so long, fellas.
Yeah, well, good-bye, Sam.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Pete.
So long.
Bye-bye.
Good-bye, Lucy.
Good-bye, Ethel.
Ricky Ricardo!
I'm over here, honey.
Over here, over here, over here.
Oh.
How did you know?
Well, for one thing, you're wearing my best tie and for another thing, you're the only man that I know that keep his mustache on with Scotch tape.
Fred, how did you see through my disguise?
What disguise?
Well, we just wanted to see what went on at a stag party.
Are you mad?
No, sweetheart, I'm not mad.
Oh, that tickles.
Ooh, it's cold outside.
Hi.
Did you get everything?
Yeah, I got everything.
But if you don't stop having these silly cravings at 4:00 in the morning, I'm gonna freeze to death.
Here.
Is this pistachio?
Yeah, that's pistachio.
Here's your spoon.
Which is that?
Hot fudge.
Pour it on top.
That's right.
Ooh.
Now, pour that right on top of this.
But, honey, these are sardines.
I know.
Right on top.
Oh, boy.
Honey, how can you possibly eat that?
Wonderful.
Mmm!
You know, I'm surprised that you didn't get any cravings.
Me?
When?
When you were sick the other day 'cause you weren't getting enough attention.
I was sick because I ate something that made me sick.
Yes, dear.
Well, I was!
Yeah.
All right.
You were.
Funny how you snapped out of it, though, after the doctor told us what we should do.
What do you mean?
Uh nothing, dear.
Did the doctor tell you to give me that daddy shower just so I get some attention?
No.
No, he just said that if we, you know, kind of made you feel that, well What's the matter?
I don't know.
I feel kind of funny.
Again?
!
Hey, that looks pretty good.
Give me some, will you?
Are you crazy?
No, I'm not crazy.
Now don't be silly.
That looks good.
I got to have some.
Now, come on, give me some of that.
Ricky!
Ricky, now stop!

{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Say, what are you doing up so late?
Oh, I'm just looking at the pictures in this family album.
Gee, they're wonderful.
How do you happen to start looking at those?
Well, I guess I was wondering what our baby might look like.
Look.
This is me, eight months old.
Gee, what are you laughing at?
Look at this.
What did they call you, "fancy pants"?
Everything's at half-mast.
Oh, now, of course at two I was very sophisticated.
Get that hair ribbon.
I think it's cute.
Oh, no!
Well, that was just about the time I joined the navy.
Oh-ho Gee, that's cute.
I think you were handsome.
I hope our baby looks the way you did.
Oh, you're sweet.
Hey, who's that character?
Oh.
That's my great grandfather.
He was an artist.
He'd better be, in that outfit.
Well, no cracks now.
He was very good.
Gee, Ricky, isn't it wonderful- all the musical and artistic talent that our baby will be surrounded with?
Yeah.
Oh, dear.
Surrounded with music and art.
He wants to be a musician, you can teach him.
He wants to be an artist Hey, who are we going to get to teach him about art?
Well, honey, I wouldn't worry about it.
It'll take care of itself somehow.
Well, now, it's not that easy.
Our child's artistic and cultural future is at stake.
Well, there's just one thing for me to do.
I know I shouldn't ask this, but what is it?
I'll have to become an artist.
Now, Lucy, don't be ridiculous.
I'm not being ridiculous.
I undoubtedly inherited a world of talent from my great grandfather.
Well where is it?
It's been sleeping for three generations.
I just have to wake it up.
Look, will you do me a favor?
Pull down the blinds and let it sleep.
Oh, now I'm not doing this for me, Ricky.
I'm doing it for the future of our child.
Well, I guess it won't hurt anything if you dabble in some watercolors for a while, but don't get too involved.
You haven't got much time before the baby gets here.
Hey, you're right.
I have to become a fine artist in three weeks.
How do you do?
Oh, uh, how do you do?
May I help you?
Yes, I'd like some art supplies, please.
Which of the media do you employ?
I beg your pardon?
Well, we have a complete stock of all the media.
Media?
Uh, what you like to work in.
Oh  just an old smock.
Oh, I see.
Well, tell me what do you like to use?
We have equipment for any kind of artwork- uh, watercolors, oils, pastel, finger painting.
Oh, finger painting- that sounds good.
I won't have to buy anything.
I already have fingers.
Are these the kind you need?
Stop.
Just a minute.
Do it again.
Do what?
Hold up your hand just the way you did it before.
Those hands.
What expression.
What symmetry.
Those long, expressive fingers.
Oh, those are the hands of a sculptor.
They are?
They certainly are.
Oh, you must be very talented.
Well, I don't know.
I've never I've never sculpt uh sculpteded before.
Well, I just couldn't be wrong.
No?
No.
Here.
Create something for me.
Oh, I couldn't.
I don't know how.
Try.
Your talent will tell you how.
Oh, go ahead.
Don't be inhibited.
Dig right in with both hands.
Well Stop!
Ah!
Wait.
Did I do something wrong?
Wrong?
Was Michelangelo wrong?
I don't know.
Just a moment ago this was a shapeless mass of clay, and look at it now.
Just look at it- such form, such rhythm such movement.
Oh, it's just something I squeezed together.
Yes, yes, but it's the way you squeezed it.
The world is waiting for a squeezer like yours.
Oh, you're just saying that.
D- Do you really think that that?
Please, please, don't take my word for it.
You've certainly heard of our owner, Mr. William Abbott- the famous art connoisseur.
Oh, uh, uh, oh, yeah.
Just a moment.
Uh Mr. Abbott!
Mr. Abbott.
I won't say a word.
You do all the talking.
Okay.
Mr. Abbott, this is Mrs. uh Ricardo.
Ricardo.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Uh, Mr. Abbott, I was wondering if This figure.
This-this-this-this this masterpiece.
Where did you get it?
Did it just come in?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about, Mr. Abbott.
You see Oh, I'm sorry, madame.
This is not for sale.
I'm putting this in my own collection.
Oh, well, y you don't understand, Mr. Abbott.
No, no, you don't understand, Mr. Abbott.
Mrs. Ricardo just made it before my own eyes with her own hands.
With these.
It's breathtaking.
Really?
Well, you know, now that I look at it, it isn't bad at all, is it?
It's the first thing I ever tried.
Oh!
She's considering taking up sculpturing.
Oh, you must.
You owe it to cultural society.
The world is calling.
Me?
Well, then, I'd better answer.
Uh, h-how much clay will I need to start?
Uh, ten pounds?
Make it 25.
Make it 50.
You have a big talent.
Oh.
Well, y-you just send anything that I need to this address.
And, uh thank you.
I feel a great discovery has been made here today.
I will personally handle your first exhibit.
Well Uh, put that in my private collection.
Now, what are you doing, and what is that crazy getup you got on?
This is an artist smock and a tam.
A smock and a tam?
Sure.
It's what all us sculptressesses wear.
All us what-essesses?
Never mind now.
Don't bother me, I'm busy.
I'm sculpting.
How did you get mixed up in all this mud pie stuff?
Well, I tried it at the art store this morning, and both the salesman and the owner said that I had exceptional talent.
There.
How do you like it?
You made that, huh?
Yeah.
All by yourself?
Yeah.
Do you like it?
Like it?
Why, honey, it's, uh I mean, I've never seen anything quite like this.
It's the most, uh And you made that all by yourself?
Oh, I'll bet you don't even know what it is.
Oh, honey, now how can you say that?
Anyone can tell what it is.
Well, what is it?
Let me look at it from the back, eh?
Okay.
Well?
That's the back of it, all right.
Oh, now, Ricky, come on.
Tell me what it is.
A boy and his dog?
No.
A girl and her dog?
No, and I don't think you're being very funny.
Okay, I give up.
What is it?
It's a child at its mother's knee.
Oh, why, sure.
I can see it now, yeah.
Sure.
Oh, look at that cute expression on the child's face.
Kootchie, kootchie, kootchie, kootchie That's the knee.
That's the knee?
Yes.
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.
Hi, Ricky.
Hi, Ethel.
Hi, Lucy.
How you doing?
Hi, Ethel.
I'm glad you're here.
At least you have taste and appreciation for art.
I do?
Well, you certainly have more taste than some people I know around here.
Now go ahead, tell Ricky what this is.
Hmm.
Hmm Well, go ahead, tell him what it is.
It's as plain as the nose on your face.
Oh, yeah.
Well?
Is it the nose on somebody's face?
No, it isn't!
No, Ethel.
It's a mother with her nose in her knee.
The two of you think you're so smart.
I think this is pretty good, considering I did it from imagination.
I didn't have a model, you know.
Well, maybe a model would help.
Well, of course a model would help.
All great artists have models.
I wish I knew someplace where I could get Good-bye.
I got to go to the club.
I got to go, Lucy, I hear Fred calling.
Ethel, you come right back here.
You do not hear Fred calling you.
Yes, I do.
I'll be right there, Fred!
Ethel, I'm very disappointed you won't model for me because you have such classic beauty.
What did you say I had?
Classic beauty.
I do?
Sure.
Look at that head, that profile.
It's like the head on a Greek coin.
You really think so, Lucy?
Yeah.
I always thought my head was kind Oh, no, you don't.
I'm not going to model for you.
Now, Ethel No.
Well, who will I get?
I don't know, but it's not going to be me.
Oh Lucy, did I tell you about Jane Sebastian?
Ethel, will you please hold your head still?
Well, her baby was due last week, and it didn't arrive, and it didn't arrive.
And when they finally rushed her to the hospital, what did she do but have twins.
Ethel, how can I do anything right if you keep moving your head?
Well, I got a crick in my neck.
Let me see what I look like.
Boy, I'm not a bit well.
Well, it's not supposed to be an exact copy of you.
I know that.
Where's my face?
Right there.
What's this supposed to be?
That's your ear.
What's it doing over my mouth?
Well, you moved so much, I couldn't tell where it was.
What's this?
That's your nose.
On top of my head?
Well, I know it isn't where it's supposed to be, but isn't it a nice nose?
It's lovely.
You know, Ethel, I think that I should do a full-length figure of you in action.
Okay, you can do a statue of me running down the back stairs.
Good-bye.
Oh, Ethel Mertz, you come back here!
Oh, darn it.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi.
I thought I'd find Ethel up here.
Well, she was, but she had to leave for a minute.
I know you're busy, so I won't bother you.
Fred, turn sideways.
What for?
That profile.
Huh?
You know, I never noticed it before, but you have real classic features.
I do?
Yeah.
Your head is like the head on a Greek coin.
Hey, Lucy, how long do I have to stay like this?
I'm getting kind of tired.
Just a few more minutes, Fred, then you can rest.
I hope so.
What's so funny?
Yes, I fail to see what's so hilarious.
Oh, no, that getup that you got on.
And you should see what she's doing to you over here.
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi.
Well, then maybe I'd better take a look.
Come on, Fred, take a look.
I'll be glad to have you see it.
I think it's coming along very nicely.
Well, straighten up, Fred.
Take a rest for a while.
I'd be glad to straighten up except for one thing.
What?
I can't.
Oh, no.
Easy, Rick, easy.
What's the matter?
You better wait.
I'd better go down and have Ethel put some liniment on it.
Ah, gee, Fred, I'm sorry.
Ah, it's okay.
As long as I'm in this position, I think I'll go bowling.
Watch it now, Fred.
Watch it going downstairs.
Take it easy now, Fred.
Take it easy.
Oh, no Lucy, look what you did to poor Hercules Mertz.
I wonder if Michelangelo had this trouble with his models.
Oh, honey, you can't expect Fred to pose like a professional model.
Hey, that's what I need.
What?
A professional model.
Now wait a minute.
They cost a lot of money- eight or ten dollars an hour.
Don't you want your child surrounded by art and culture?
Not at ten bucks a throw I don't.
Well, if you're going to be crass I am not being crass.
And what does that mean?
It means you care more for money than you do our child.
I do not, honey.
We just haven't got that kind of money to spend.
Oh!
Look, honey, we've already spent a fortune on the baby- nursery things, furniture, layette.
As it is, I'm going to have to pay for them on time.
It's not that bad.
It is, too.
If they deliver the baby C.O.D., I'm going to have to send him back.
You don't love me or the baby.
Oh, now, honey, you know I do.
You do not.
Now, look, sweetheart.
If I thought that you had any kind of talent at this, money would be no object.
Really?
Well, you just ask Mr. William Abbott- he's the owner of the art store, and he's a famous connoisseur, and he said I was brilliant.
He also wanted to sell you some clay.
Oh, you have such a sneaky, suspicious mind.
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll make a deal with you.
I'll get one of the art critics from one of the papers to come up to the house and look at your work.
If he says that you have any kind of talent, you can have anything you want.
Really, Ricky?
Yeah, but wait a minute now.
If he says no, that you don't have any talent, then you forget this whole business.
It's a deal.
Okay.
Good morning, Lucy.
Hi.
I came to get some more liniment for Fred's arm.
I'm sorry.
I gave you all we had.
How is his arm?
Is it any better?
It's pretty good.
We got it down to here now.
Well, that's good.
Say, Ethel, would you do me a favor?
No!
Oh, Ethel, come back here.
I don't want you to model for me.
I have a model- someone who appreciates my work and who'll pose for me as long as I want.
Who?
Me.
You?
Yes.
I'm going to make a bust of myself.
I thought you'd already done that.
Ricky's bringing home an art critic to look at my work.
And I think that if I make a perfect replica of my head, it will really impress him.
Well, I hope your head turns out better than Fred's arm.
It will.
This book tells how to make a mold of anything that you want to copy.
You mean, you're going to make a mold of your..
?
Yeah.
I'm going to make an impression of my head and face.
I'm going to put clay in it, take the mold away, and I'll have a perfect replica of my head.
Hey, Lucy, that's a wonderful idea.
Yeah, and it's so easy, too.
I got the plaster all mixed.
Now listen, "Cover the object to be copied "with plaster of paris and let it remain this way "until the plaster hardens.
Then crack away " Lucy!
What?
You mean, you're going to bury your head in plaster of paris?
Sure.
But you won't be able to breathe.
Oh.
I never thought of that.
Well, what am I going to do?
It has to be a perfect likeness to get by that art critic.
Maybe the book tells some other way to do it.
Let's see.
What's the matter?
Ethel!
I can't get my arm out!
You're stuck?
Oh, hey, look, pull, pull hard.
I can't get it out!
Well, let me try Oh, Lucy Right this way, Mr. Harvey.
You'll see what I mean.
Hi, Ricky.
Oh, hi, Ethel.
Uh, this is, uh, Mr. Harvey, the art critic of the Times.
Mrs. Mertz, Mr. Harvey.
How do you do?
Uh, where's Lucy?
Oh, she had to go down to the store.
Well, that's funny.
She knew I was bringing Mr. Harvey home.
Oh, she'll be right back.
Would you like me to show you her work?
Oh, no, I th I think we better, uh, wait till Lucy gets here.
Uh, if you don't mind, Mr. Ricardo, I always prefer to look at these amateur attempts uh, without the artist being present.
Oh, all right.
What did she sculpt this time?
She made a head of herself.
She did, huh?
Oh, you should have seen her.
She put up seven mirrors all around so she'd cover every angle.
: Oh, no.
Oh, this is really pretty good.
Are you ready?
Oh, I can hardly wait.
All right.
There.
Hey, you know something?
It kind of looks like her.
I told you it was good.
This is excellent, Ricardo, excellent!
It is, huh?
Oh, my boy, believe me, if this is a sample of your wife's first attempt at sculpturing, you're married to a genius.
Well, what do you know?
Oh, Lucy will be so happy when she hears this.
Oh, this is fine, fine.
Say, look, do me a favor.
Sure.
What?
I- It's always a tremendous thrill for me to be in at the launching of a great artistic career.
Let me buy this.
He wants to buy it.
Buy it?
Yes.
I- I'd like to add it to my private collection.
Oh, oh, Mr. Harvey, you can't have that for your private collection.
I don't I don't think Lucy'd want to sell it.
Oh, what are you talking about?
I would think she'd be delighted to sell it.
Oh, you don't know how hard she worked on this.
She put a lot of herself into this statue.
Well, I guess she's right.
I guess it'll have to be up to Lucy.
Well, I don't have time to wait.
I'm-I'm due at an art critic's meeting.
Uh, let me know if she'll sell it, will you?
All right.
Thank you for coming out, Mr. Harvey.
Oh, Mr. Ricardo.
I'd love to have this at that meeting with me.
Won't you let me buy it?
Well, uh no, I-I'm afraid I couldn't take the responsibility.
I'll pay $500.
Oh, no!
I'll take the responsibility.
Mr. Harvey, you mustn't do that.
This statue isn't worth $500.
Well, I believe I know what a statue is worth, Mrs. Mertz.
I'll write you a check.
Thank you.
Um uh um Mr. Harvey, don't you think you ought to take another look at this?
It really isn't worth that much money.
It isn't quite right.
Now look at that mouth.
You know the-the side of it should be up higher.
Like that.
Ethel!
And this-this side of it should be lower.
Like that.
Oh, Mrs. Mertz.
And, you know, the whole thing's too long.
Don't you think it should be like that?
Ethel, now look what you done!
You ruined it!
Oh, no, she hasn't ruined it.
I haven't?
No.
Uh, do you know something that when Mrs. Ricardo is a famous sculptress, this will be a-a collector's item.
Here.
Thank you.
Oh, wait!
I'll deliver it anyplace you want me to.
Oh, no.
I wouldn't trust this to any other hands but my own.
Oh, give me that check!
What kind of a ridiculous?
!
I didn't have anything to do with this, Mr. Harvey!
Lucy!
The clerk was played by Leon Belasco, the store owner was Shep Menken and the art critic, Paul Harvey.

Oh, but not on opening night.
This is a brand-new show.

You can't be in where I am anyway.
All you can do is just sit there and worry.
I know, I know, but I want you to know that I am sitting there worrying.
I want you to feel that I'm near.
Well, I'd like to feel that you're near, too, but I don't want you to lose your job.

I'll be right back.
Stay right there.
Hello, Ethel.
Ethel, will you do me a favor?
Could you and Fred come up here for a few minutes?
Well, the doctor said it would be any minute now and Ricky's driving me crazy.
Yeah, he keeps staring at me like I'm going to explode any minute.
Yeah, well, come up and treat the whole thing very casually, will you?
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Oh, thank you, dear.
There you are, honey.
Cookie?
Uh-huh.

Honey, it's the door.
Oh.
Hi, Ricky.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Hi, folks.
Hiya, Fred.
Hi.
Hi, Lucy.
We weren't doing anything, so we thought we'd just come up and see how you are.
Well, what a nice surprise.
Well, what's new?
Uh, Lucy's due to leave for the hospital any minute.
Oh, that's nice.
I guess you didn't hear what I said.
The baby's due any minute- right now, maybe this very second.
- Oh.
What else is new?
- Fred, did you hear what I said?
The baby's due any minute.
What's so amazing about that?
You knew it would happen sooner or later.
I would think you'd get a little excited or something.
Why?
It's a perfectly natural thing.
Sure.
Babies are born every day.
You see, dear?
The Mertzes don't get excited.
There's nothing to get upset upset about.
Is it really due any minute?
!
How do you feel?
!
Are you sure you're all right?
I think we ought to have a rehearsal!
A rehearsal?
For what?
A rehearsal for when you get the signal.
Everything should go like clockwork.
I don't want to lose a minute getting you to the hospital.
She's right.
She's right.
Oh, that's a wonderful idea, Ricky.
Yeah.
Now, Ricky, Ricky, Ricky T- There's no problem, dear.
The room is reserved at the hospital.
The doctor's number is right here by the phone.
My suitcase is all packed.
All we have to do is go downstairs, get a cab, and go.
I know, I know, but who's going to call the doctor?
Who's going to carry the suitcase?
Who's going to hail the cab?
That's what we got to rehearse.
Hold it.
Hold it, group.
Look, you-you split it up any way you want.
I'm going to go lie down.
All right, honey.
I think that's a good idea.
You need your rest.
Here.
I'll help you in.
That's nice.
Come on, honey.
Don't you worry about anything, now.
No.
I won't.
You leave everything to us, honey.
Okay.
Take it easy.

Good-bye.
Hey, that was pretty good.

That's right.
We got to keep calm.
Good.
Yeah, right, put that over there, Fred, so we can start right now.
Get it over there Get it over where it was at the beginning, now, all right?

Now, let's put this stuff right where it was so we know where everything is.
Now all we have to do is just wait.

What are you doing in that outfit?
I was doing a show down at the club when they called me that my wife just had the baby.
Now let me out of this thing.
Oh, we're sorry, Mr. Ricardo.
All right.
Mr. Ricardo?
This is Mr. Ricardo.
Yes?

You've had your bottle.
There aren't any pins sticking in you.
You're dry as a bone.
What's troubling you?
Lucy?
Lucy, what's the matter?
I don't know.
You mind if I try?
Be my guest.
Now, you just come on to your Aunt Ethel.
You settle right dow What's that?
Mrs. Trumbull upstairs.
She's been doing that all night.
I guess she's mad because Ricky's crying.
Oh, Mrs. Trumbull's such a sweet old lady.
I can't imagine her getting that mad.
She must be hanging pictures.
On the floor?
Aw, now, don't you pay any attention to that old crank.
You just settle down now and stop your crying.

Hello there, sunshine.
You want to hear the mockingbird?
Hear the mockingbird?
Hmm?
See?
Well, anybody can make him stop crying for a minute.
Just wait till you put him down.
Yeah.
Now, listen, little fella, we're going to put you down and you're going to be a great big, brave boy and not make another sound, and make your Uncle Fred proud of you.
Okeydokey?
Yeah, what a champ.
Nighty-night.
Just wait.
How'd he do that?
Beginner's luck.
Beginner's luck, nothing.
It's my phenomenal memory.
Memory?
Yeah.
It's not generally known, but I was a little bit of a baby boy myself once.
You know, to look at him now, it's hard to believe he was ever a little baby anything.
Well, what's the difference?
The main thing is, Ricky's asleep.
Yeah.
Well, good night, honey.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Ricky, what's the matter with you?
Now look what you did.
You woke up the baby.
What you put the crib over here for?
What?
You shouldn't have put the crib over here!
What's that?
The art gallery upstairs.
Huh?
Never mind.
I'll explain it to you in the morning.
Gee, I'm sorry I woke you up, old man.
Now that you got him awake and yelling, what are you going to do about it?
Well, I apologized to him.
What else do you want me to do?
I want you to put him back to sleep, that's what I want you to do.
Put him back to sleep?
Honey, I had a hard night.
I've been working.
What do you think I've been doing?
Well, honey, you're supposed to put him to sleep, and things like that- you're his mother.
Hey, I know.
Why don't you walk with him?
Well, there's a fresh, new idea.
Oh.
You've been doing that.
Yeah.
Ricky, why don't you sing to him?
Oh, honey, please, not tonight.
I'm so tired.
Come on, honey.
Oh   Rockaby baby on the treetop  When the wind blows, the cradle will rock All right!
All right!
All right!
All right!
All right!
All right!
All right!
I give up!
I give up!
Anything is better than that.
Come on, I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Oh, come on, boy.
Come on.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.
Rockaby baby on the treetop When the wind blows, the cradle will rock Da, da-da, dee-da, da, da-da dee  Down will come baby, cradle and all Rockaby baby on the treetop When the wind blows, the cradle will rock Da, da-da, dee-da, dee da-da, da Hi.
Oh, hi, honey.
How's Little Ricky this morning?
Oh, fine.
He slept the rest of the night.
Where are you going all dressed up?
I'm going shopping.
I'm having a table of bridge tomorrow.
You are?
So am I. Really?
Yeah.
Why mess up both apartments?
Let's have them together.
Okay.
Let's have it up here, and we'll have lunch first.
All right.
Both make half the sandwiches up.
Yep.
Will you bring your card table, your teapot, and your cups?
How many cups?
Eight.
Eight cups.
Okay, I'll bring 'em.
Who is that?
Oh.
Mrs. Trumbull.
Mrs. Ricardo.
Well, Mrs. Mertz, I'm glad I found you two together.
You are?
How are you, Mrs. Trumbull?
As well as could be expected after two hours' sleep.
Oh, I'm sorry about that, Mrs. Trumbull.
The baby was a little fussy.
He won't annoy you again.
No, I'm sure of that.
Perhaps you'll recall this piece of paper, Mrs. Mertz.
Your lease?
Yes.
"It is expressly understood that at no time will children be allowed to live in said building.
" Little Ricky.
He's a "children.
" Since it says "no children" in plain English, what excuse is there for Mrs. Ricardo's baby?
Uh uh He can't read.
"He can't read.
" Did the Ricardos sign a lease like mine, or didn't they?
Of course they did, but they didn't have a baby till ten years later.
I'd expect them to do something underhanded like that.
Aw, now, Mrs. Trumbull can't you be a little more understanding?
I understand only one thing- either the Ricardos leave or I do.
Mrs. Trumbull, I'd rather you didn't force me to make that decision.
Oh, Ethel, wait a minute.
You can't afford to have another vacant apartment.
Don't worry, Lucy, we can rent that apartment just like that.
And even if we couldn't, it wouldn't matter because my friendship with the Ricardos means more to me than all the money on Earth.
I'm not the only tenant who feels that way, Mrs. Mertz.
I advise you to think it over.
Well, I advise you to think it over.
Well!
Oh, Ethel, I can't let you do that.
You'll lose all your tenants.
We'll just have to move, that's all.
No, you're staying.
I won't let you out of your lease.
Oh, Ethel, you're just about the swellest friend a person ever had.
Now, Lucy, let's not talk about it.
If there's anything I can't stand, it's somebody who does something nice for somebody and then talks about it all the time.
All right.
Just forget it, honey.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
So long.
Bye.
And then the old prune said, "Either the Ricardos leave or I do.
" And then Lucy said, "Wait a minute, Ethel.
You can't afford to have another vacant apartment.
" And then what do you guess I said?
What?
I was there.
Oh, yes.
Well, I said, "Don't worry, Lucy.
"We can rent that apartment just like that.
"And even if we couldn't, it wouldn't matter, "because my friendship with the Ricardos means more to me than all the money on Earth.
" If I'd have been there, I'd have said the same thing.
Gee.
And then she said, "I'm not the only tenant who feels this way.
I advise you to think it over.
" And I said, "Well, I advise you to think it over.
" And then she flounced out of the apartment.
Ethel, I think that you're just wonderful.
Oh, it wasn't anything.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Well, Lucy and I will never forget it, will we, honey?
No, no, we never will.
Well, come on, Fred.
We've got a big day tomorrow- bridge, you know.
Bye.
Good night.
Bye, Lucy.
Good night.
Good night, Rick.
Good night.
Gee, honey, wasn't Ethel wonderful?
Yeah.
Wonderful.
You don't sound very appreciative.
Oh, I am, I am.
In fact, I'm up to here with appreciation.
Huh?
Well, it was nice of her, okay, but all day long, she's been reenacting her scene.
She told the mailman, the grocery boy, the cop on the beat.
This afternoon, she came down to the beauty parlor while I was there and played a matinee for the manicurist.
Well, maybe she got it out of her system by now.
I hope so.
Well, honey, it was nice.
Nice, yes, but Ethel acts as if she discovered penicillin.
And then the old prune said, "Either the Ricardos move, or I move.
" And then Lucy said, "Wait a minute, Ethel.
You can't afford to have another vacant apartment.
" And then I said, "Lucy, don't worry.
"We can rent that apartment just like that, "and even if we couldn't, it wouldn't matter, "because my friendship with the Ricardos means more to me than all the money on Earth.
"  And then she said, "Well, I advi " Oh, hi!
Oh, that hat is adorable!
Yeah, how about that, huh?
Dorothy, come here.
I've got to tell you Oh, it's been very exciting around here.
Wait'll you hear what happened yesterday morning.
You know that old Mrs. Trumbull that lives upstairs?
Well, she came down here this morning Oh, too bad, honey, you're not going to be able to finish your story.
The rest of the girls are here.
Oh, well, listen Oh, hi!
That is the cutest outfit!
How about that, huh?
and then the old prune said, "Either the Ricardos leave this apartment, or I do.
" Oh, off all the nerve.
Isn't that awful?
And then Lucy said, "Wait a minute, Ethel, you can't afford to have another vacant apartment.
" And then I said  "Lucy, don't worry.
We can rent "that apartment just like that, and even "if we couldn't, it wouldn't matter "because my friendship with the Ricardos means more to me than all the money on Earth.
" Well!
I'm sorry, Ethel.
I just couldn't stand it any longer.
Oh.
You don't care how many tenants I lose, but you get awfully excited if I tell a couple of people about it.
A couple of people?
Ethel, that scene has had more performances than South Pacific.
Well!
That does it.
I'm leaving.
My half of the party come downstairs.
Go ahead!
See if I care.
Come on, and bring that table- it's mine- and all those dishes.
And I'll take the sandwiches I brought up, too.
That's my sandwich.
Come on, girls.
Just a minute.
That is my tablecloth.
Oh, she makes me so mad  Oh, she woke up the baby!
And keep that squalling brat quiet!
Oh!
Mrs. Ricardo, I've been trying to make up this afternoon for the sleep I lost last night.
My nerves are almost gone.
I'd I If I hear that baby cry once more, I'm going to send for the police.
The police?
I'll be there, honey.
Lucy, I'm home!
Lucy?
Shh!
Ricky, you'll wake up the baby.
Mrs. Trumbull said if he annoyed her one more time, she was going to call the police.
What do I care what she says?
We got Ethel on our team.
You'd better consult your program.
There's been a last-minute change in the lineup.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
Ethel and I had a fight.
What?
!
Well, I just couldn't stand it any longer.
Tallulah Mertz played her big scene three times at the bridge game today.
Finally, I just started acting it out with her.
Oh, Lucy, you didn't.
Well, she makes me so mad.
All right, honey, so she make you mad, but do you have to make a big fight out of it and lose your best friend?
That's the most childish thing I've ever heard.
Well well, she did us a tremendous favor.
You don't know how a thing like that can get on your nerves.
I do, too.
And I also know what you're going to do right now.
What?
You're going to get on that phone, call Ethel and apologize.
Apologize?
!
Oh, no, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are.
Oh, no, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are.
I am not!
Hi.
How about some dinner?
Dinner?
!
Yeah.
I'm hungry.
Fred Mertz, do you mean to tell me that you can even think of eating after what happened to me this afternoon?
Well, no, I can't, but my stomach can.
Now, look, honey, you're making entirely too much out of this.
Too much?
!
Do you realize what happened to me up there today?
We were having a perfectly nice bridge luncheon and I was telling the girls I know- you told me, you told me.
That's the trouble with you- you keep harping on things too much.
What?
!
Now, now, now.
I won't say that Lucy was right, but I'm getting tired of hearing that story myself, and I think the thing for you to do is to go up there and apologize.
Apologize?
!
Why?
Well, because it's your fault as much as hers, and because you'll never be happy till you and Lucy make up, and because I'm hungry.
Well maybe if she apologizes to me first, why, then maybe I'll apologize to her.
Well, that's better.
Now come on.
Don't push me!
Lucy, for the last time, are you going to get on that phone and call Ethel?
No!
All right, then you're going to go right downstairs and apologize.
Come on.
No.
Now, Ricky, stop.
Come on.
Lucy I apologize.
Ethel?
So do I. You really mean it?
Yes, I really do.
Do you?
Yes, I do, Ethel.
Oh, I'm sorry, Lucy.
So am I. Okay, let's eat.
Yeah, come on, let's eat.
Okay.
What say we all eat up here together?
Fine.
Let's eat here, fine.
Wonderful.
I'll fix something.
All right, go ahead.
Cook the dinner.
Fine, fine.
Good deal.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
What a pair.
Yeah.
You know, they'd die without each other.
Yeah, you know something?
Lucy was right.
No.
Ethel was right.
Listen, listen, Ethel was harping on that story till even I was sick.
Well I guess Ethel has the habit of staying on a subject until it gets sickening.
What do you mean, "sickening"?
Well, you know what I mean, Fred.
You just said yourself that sometimes you get sick of her.
Well, I'm supposed to get sick of her.
She's my wife.
Well, you don't have to get upset about it, Fred.
I was just agreeing with you.
Well, agree with me without making cracks about Ethel.
Well, I'm sorry, Fred.
You don't see me taking potshots at Lucy, although heaven knows I'm loaded with ammunition.
And what do you mean by that?
I mean I'd rather be married to a blabbermouth than an ingrate.
Ingrate?
!
You don't even know what it means.
It doesn't matter.
I don't like the way you looked when you said that.
Ingrate!
Tu lo que un viejo muy atrevido, muy bruto y muy sinverguenza!
Oh, now, listen, you Cuban crumb!
Oh, I'd better get out of here before I bust your nose.
Yeah, well, I'd like to see you try it!
Break you in pieces!
You and who else?
!
I'll massacre you!
They're fighting!
What about?
Mrs. Ricardo.
Mrs. Ricardo!
Mrs. Ricardo!
Come on now.
Come on now, then.
Go ahead now, Fred, apologize.
Tell Fred you're sorry, Ricky.
Oh Why don't you apologize together?
Look, now you say "I'm sorry, Fred," and you say, "I'm sorry, Ricky.
" Now, I'll conduct.
One, two, three.
I'm sorry, Ricky.
I'm sorry, Fred.
There you are!
You see?
That wasn't so hard.
I'm glad that's over.
I didn't mean it when I called you a Cuban crumb.
That's all right, Fred.
I didn't mean it when I called you un viejo sinverguenza, atrevido y bruto.
Yeah, that's all right, too, but what does it mean?
If I told you, we'd start fighting all over again.
You know, for four grown-up people, we've been acting pretty childish.
Yeah, we're bigger babies than Little Ricky.
Little Ricky!
We left him alone!
Oh, no!
Oh, thank goodness he isn't crying.
Shh, shh.
Mrs. Trumbull!
Mrs. Ricardo, you should be ashamed of yourself- running off and leaving this poor, little child alone.
Don't you worry, dear.
You'll always have me around to see that nobody leaves you alone again.

{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Honey, I think that tomorrow : Please!
: I'm sorry, honey, I didn't mean What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy or something?
You want the baby to keep us awake again tonight?
I'm sorry, dear, I guess I wasn't thinking.
If I don't get some sleep soon, I don't know what I'm going to do.
Well, honey, we'll keep our fingers crossed.
Maybe we won't hear a peep out of him tonight.
Well, I hope not.
And, honey, listen, if he does wake up, I'd certainly appreciate it if you'd get up and take care of him.
Sure, honey, I will.
Okay.
Come on, let's go to bed.
What?
!
Oh, Ricky, I'm simply asking if the baby wake up that you get up and take care of him.
Well, honey, I know it's a lot of hard work taking care of the baby, but that's what mothers are for.
Oh, and what are fathers for?
Well, the father is the breadwinner.
See, the father is supposed to get his rest at night so he can get up fresh in the morning, go out into the world and make money for his family.
You wouldn't tell me the rules before the game started.
The next time we have a baby, I get to be the father.
Now, don't try to be funny.
: I'm not trying to be funny.
You just don't know how tired I am.
You don't care anything about me.
Oh, honey, I do, honestly I do.
Then will you get up and take care of him?
Isn't there some kind of a compromise?
Look, I'll tell you what- maybe the baby won't cry at all.
But if he does, whoever hears him first will get up, keep him quiet so the other one can sleep.
Now, is that fair?
All right, you got a deal.
Okay.
Come on, let's go to bed.
All right, you out-snored me, you big phony.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's all right, honey, it's all right.
It's all right, baby.
That's okay, that's okay, honey.
Shh.
Lucy!
Lucy, honey, wake up!
What's the matter?
Baby cry?
Don't get up, dear, I'll get him.
Honey, it's morning.
Oh, oh.
Straighten up.
Uh oh, I can't.
Lower the side of the crib.
Huh?
Oh.
What time is it?
It's 10:00.
Oh, I got to get your breakfast.
Hey, honey, wait.
Honey!
Honey, please don't don't worry about my breakfast.
Come on, you got to get some rest.
All right.
Listen, tonight I'm going to make sure you go to bed real early.
Oh, no, we're going to play bridge with the Mertzes.
Oh, no, no, I'll call that off.
Oh, no, don't do that, that's all the fun I have.
I'll be all right.
All I need is a little sleep.
All I ask Well, are you all set to play  Honey, I don't seem to be able to find the card No use trying to play tonight.
No.
She's really bushed, isn't she?
Yes.
I guess taking care of the house and the baby is a little bit too much for her.
Well, taking care of a little baby's no easy job.
Well You know what I was thinking, Ethel?
What?
I ought to get Lucy a maid.
A maid?
Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful.
Well, it's a big expense, but she can't go on this way.
So you're thinking of getting Lucy a maid, huh?
Hey, that idea might be a good thing for us, too.
Why, Fred, are you thinking of getting me a maid?
Nope.
I'm thinking of hiring you out to the Ricardos.
Lucy, honey wake up.
: Three, no trump!
We haven't started playing yet.
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Hi.
And, honey, you know what we just decided?
I'm going to get you a maid.
Isn't that wonderful, Lucy?
A maid!
I must still be asleep.
I thought you said you were going to get me a maid.
I did, honey.
You can't go on this way.
You need some help.
Oh, Ricky, you're the most wonderful husband in the world!
Oh, honey!
Gee, just think, honey, this is the last breakfast I'll ever have to serve.
What time is the first maid coming out?
Well, the agency said she'd be here about 10:00.
What do you mean, the first maid?
Well, honey, you have to talk to three or four of them before you can decide.
Oh, anybody the agency sends out ought to be all right.
Now, wait a minute, honey.
I don't want you to get started wrong.
I want you to handle this like a real businesswoman.
Well You got to ask her questions, find out something about her.
Oh, I don't know.
Honey, why don't you stay around and interview her?
Well, I can't, honey.
I got to go to rehearsal.
Well, I've never interviewed one before.
What do I ask her?
Well, you got to ask her, uh where she worked before, why she left, if she's a good cook, if she knows how to serve if she's got a catcher's mitt.
Well, couldn't I just hire her, and hope that everything works out all right?
Now, now, now, wait a minute.
The most important thing in hiring anybody is to establish the relationship right from the start.
Oh.
You've got to be firm.
Let her know who's working for who.
Oh.
Yeah, don't give her too much time off.
Make sure she understands what her hours are and what her duties are.
Be tough.
Well, I better go.
I'll call you later, see how you made out.
Okay.
Bye.
Hey  Oh, Ethel.
I was practicing interviewing the maid.
Oh.
Ricky said that I should be firm with her.
Well, what are you going to say?
Well, I Here, you be the maid.
Now, first, I want to get a look at you.
Eh.
Now, I want you to understand just what kind of a job this is.
It's no cinch.
You'll cook and clean, do the laundry and the ironing and help take care of the baby.
You'll have Thursdays off and Sunday afternoons only.
I expect you here at 8:00 in the morning and you mustn't leave until after Do you understand?
Hey, that was good, you were real firm.
Well, it's the only way.
You see, you have to establish the relationship right from the start.
There she is.
Well, I'll see you later.
Now, be firm.
Yeah.
Good morning, I am from the employment agency.
Are you Mrs. Ricardo?
Yes.
Uh, there are a few things that I think that First there are some things that I think we should discuss.
That's right.
Now, I must have Wednesday afternoons off and every weekend.
I can't possibly come before 9:00 in the morning, and I must leave before 7:00 at night.
Oh.
Of course, you have an automatic dishwasher?
No, we don't.
A dryer?
No.
Uh, but we have a we have a garbage disposal and a washing machine.
Well And a television set, 21-inch screen.
I'll take the job.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
May I help you off with your coat?
Yes.
Oh, that's a very pretty hat.
Yes.
Well, now I'll see what I've gotten myself into.
Oh, yes, go right ahead.
Just don't wake up the baby.
Baby?
!
Well, he's just a little one.
He, he really isn't very much trouble.
- Who takes care of him?
- I do?
Including his laundry?
Oh, yes, yes, I do everything for him.
I take full charge of the baby, always.
Oh, well, that's all right.
Yes.
Where's the kitchen?
In there.
Oh, I forgot, what is your name?
Mrs. Porter.
Oh, and what do I call you?
Mrs. Porter.
Ricardos' residence.
Huh?
Just a minute.
Are you in to a Mrs. Mertz?
Ask her which Mrs. Mertz.
Which Mrs. Mertz?
The one you owe two months' rent to.
Hello, Ethel.
Oh, this is Mrs. Mertz' scullery girl.
I'll ask the downstairs maid to ask the upstairs maid if madame can talk to you.
All right, all right.
How you doing?
Well, it isn't exactly the way I dreamed about it.
What's the matter?
Oh, I'll come down later and tell you about it.
She's fixing my lunch now.
Fixing your lunch?
That doesn't sound bad.
Well, I think maybe it'll work out all right.
I'll be down later.
Good-bye.
Lunch is ready.
Oh, all right.
Well, you don't want me to bring it in there, do you?
Oh.
Oh, no, of course not.
I'll eat in the kit uh, in the breakfast nook.
What's the matter?
Don't you like peanut butter sandwiches?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I like them very much as a rule, but I tell you what, I think I'd rather have some of that roast beef that's in the refrigerator.
That snivelly little leftover?
Why, there was half a roast Oh, yeah, that was the one.
Why, it hardly made a good mouthful.
Well, there's a head of lettuce, if I could If I didn't have the salad, I'd have starved to death.
There's some jelly up in the All gone?
Some milk?
All gone?
Well, I've got to eat, too, you know.
Oh, I know, I know.
Yes, of course, surely.
That's the way to eat a peanut butter sandwich.
That's what's good for you- a nice, pure thick peanut butter on dry bread.
Good, huh?
I'll make you another one.
Hi.
Oh, pardon my answering the door dressed like this, your highness.
If you'll excuse me, I'll go put on a formal gown.
Oh, shut up.
What's the matter?
Oh, Ethel, let's face it, I'm not the type to have a maid.
Some people are cut out for champagne and caviar.
I'm more the beer and pretzel type.
What's the matter?
What happened?
Oh, she walks all over me.
She gets most of the time off, I have to take care of the baby, I have to do his laundry, and she's eating me out of house and home.
What am I going to do?
That's easy, fire her.
Fire her?
Oh, I don't know.
Well, you certainly can't keep her.
You just said you're not the type to have a maid.
Well, I'm not the type to fire one, either.
Lucy Ricardo, are you afraid of the maid?
Afraid?
Me?
Yes!
Lucy, you go right up there and fire her.
Come on, now, who's the boss?
You or her?
I am.
Who gives the orders?
I do.
Well, are you going to let someone, a stranger, someone you pay money to, boss you around?
I should say not!
Well, what are you going to do about it?
I'm going to go right up there and tell her she's through right now.
I'll show her who's the boss.
She's got a lot of nerve.
Mrs. Porter.
Yes?
May I see you for a moment?
Mrs. Porter, there's something I'd like to say to you.
Well?
Uh, could I have glass of water, please?
Thank you.
Mrs. Porter!
Well?
Could I have some more water, please?
Well, you haven't finished that.
Oh.
I guess I'm kind of thirsty from all that peanut butter.
Oh, hi, honey.
How's my lady of leisure?
All rested up, huh?
No.
Why, what's the matter?
I don't like having a maid.
I'm just not cut out for it, Ricky.
I feel like I'm working for her.
That's worse than doing all the work myself.
Well, we only got her because we thought it was going to be good for you.
If you don't like her, we'll let her go.
We'll fire her, huh?
Sure.
Good.
I'll go down and see Ethel, and after you fire her, call me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This is your project- you hire her, you fire her.
Oh, I tried to and I couldn't.
Well, why not?
I got waterlogged.
Huh?
You'll do it for me, won't you, Ricky?
Honey, I haven't even met her.
Well, that's perfect.
I'll introduce you.
I'll say, "Mrs. Porter, this is my husband.
" You say, "How do you do?
You're fired.
" Now don't be silly.
I told you I want you to run this house like a business.
Well, if you're afraid Me?
Afraid?
Why, I could go in there right now and fire her just like that.
Well, go ahead.
I will, I'll tell her, go right in there now.
That's telling her.
Well, I was waiting for you to introduce me.
Oh, sure.
Besides, if we don't lower our voices, nobody will have to tell her- she'll hear us.
Hey hey, that's it.
What?
Um : It's too bad, but I think we're going to have to let Mrs. Porter go!
Did you say we have to let Mrs. Porter go?
!
Yes, I'm going to let her go right after dinner!
It just isn't working out.
Well, I guess you have to let Mrs. Porter go, then.
Yes.
Um, I'm going to let her go, but I'm going to give her a good recommendation and a week's pay.
A whole week.
A good recommendation.
A week's pay.
A good recommendation!
Mrs. Porter, what are you doing here?
I went out to empty some trash and the back door locked me out.
I knocked, but with all that yelling, nobody could hear me.
You must have had some fight.
Hi.
Hi.
What's the matter?
Oh, I can't stand it upstairs with that maid, and I haven't got the nerve to fire her.
Well, somebody's got to fire her.
Yeah.
Ethel, will you No!
Guess there's not much chance that she'll quit, huh?
With an easy job like that, why should she quit?
Yeah.
Hey, wait a minute- what if she didn't have such an easy job?
What if she had to work her head off cleaning up all the time?
Yeah.
How can we make my apartment look like a pigpen?
Oh, that's easy- let Fred stay there for a while.
No, come on, now, help me, what can we do?
Well, let's see I could have Fred bring up a lot of junk from the basement.
Tell him to bring up everything that's messy.
Okay.
Let's see, then we have to wait until Mrs. Porter goes marketing, and then we'll mess the place up.
And after she gets it all cleaned up, we'll say we get it that dirty every day.
That ought to do it.
That ought to do it, yes, sir.
Oh, hurry up.
Come on!
How does it look?
Oh, boy, that's beginning to look good.
How you doing in the kitchen?
Oh, fine.
I made a paste out of peanut butter and mustard and molasses and I smeared it over everything out there.
Oh, this I got to see.
Come on and look at it.
I really did a fine job, wait till you see it.
Oh, no, oh oh, Ethel.
Isn't that great?
Oh, I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it.
Oh, look at that.
Oh!
Well, let's see now.
We forget anything?
Well, we could always throw a dead horse in the corner.
Hey, hey!
What?
I found these old feather pillows.
Here.
What are they for?
What are they for?
Why, to spread the feathers around, of course.
How do you go about doing that?
Well, there's only one way.
Oh!
Hey, what's going on here?
Hey, are you crazy or something?
What are you doing?
It's a scheme to make Mrs. Porter quit.
Oh, no.
What's the matter?
Well, I felt sorry for you, so I called her up an hour ago and I fired her.

Ricky, Ricky!
Ricky, guess what?
What, what?
The baby laughed right out loud.
That's nice.
You said the baby laughed right out loud?
Yes, and it was so cute.
You should've seen it.
And it wasn't an accident.
I made a funny face and he laughed at it.
Isn't that intelligent?
Oh, honey.
I wish I seen him.
Well, come on, I'll make him do it again.
You think he will?
Sure he will.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Come on.
Now, you just watch.
Come on, honey.
Hi, there, old man.
Here we go.
Here we go again.
Now, you watch.
All right.
Well, he laughed before.
Maybe that face wasn't funny.
He's a great audience, this kid.
Well, I'll I'll get him.
Pekinese dog.
Deadpan Ricardo.
Hey, honey, cut that out!
You going to scare the kid to death.
Honey, put your face back where it belongs.
Oh, great.
Thank you.
Never mind.
That's very funny.
Is that any way for you to act?
How about some lunch, eh?
I'll be right with you.
Can't you do what mama wants you to do, huh?
You got a sink to be fixed?
Hey, Rick.
Oh!
Oh, hi, Fred.
Just a minute, would you?
Just a minute.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
What's so exciting?
All those Indians you used to have in this country.
The stories about them would really make your blood cuddle.
"Cuddle"?
Yeah, cuddle.
Oh, "cuddle.
" I thought you meant like in that song "Curdle Up a Little Closer.
" Oh.
What are you reading that kind of stuff for, anyhow?
Well, uh, Lucy wants me to study American history so I'll be a good father for the boy.
And you know something?
It gave me a wonderful idea.
Yeah?
Yes, sir.
I'm putting on a show at the club- an Indian show.
Oh fine.
Hey, have you got a job for me in it?
Well, you don't look like the Indian type to me, Fred.
You look more like the plumber type.
Which reminds me, I got a sink in the kitchen that needs fixing.
All right, okay, okay.
I'll be right with you.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, I got it, honey.
Oh.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Jerry.
Yeah, you find the Indians?
Two of them.
Good, yeah.
That's what we need.
Okay, look, Jerry.
I tell you what.
Send them over to my apartment this afternoon and I'll look at them, eh?
Okay.
Thank you.
Good-bye, Jerry.
Ug!
Okay, I give up.
What are you supposed to be?
Me a heap good injun.
Me do-em soft moccasin dance for you.
How you likum?
Stinkum.
Look, Fred, they got to be real Indians.
I'm sorry, old man.
I got a couple of them coming over here this afternoon.
Coming over here?
Yeah.
Oh, well, listen.
How are you going to keep Lucy out of the act?
Lucy?
Yeah.
Oh, well, that's all over with.
Lucy's a mother now.
She's perfectly happy just staying at home and taking care of the baby.
This I got to see.
Hi, Fred.
Hi, Lucy.
Oh, Lucy.
What?
I was just telling Fred that since you had the baby the thought of being in show business has completely left your mind.
Hasn't it?
Yup, it's gone.
See, she doesn't care anything about the new show.
New show?
What do I do?
I thought it had left your mind.
Well, it had, but you opened the door and it flew right back in.
Oh, no.
Ricky, what'll I do?
What'll I do, sing?
No.
Dance?
No.
Tell jokes?
No.
Play my saxophone?
No.
Walk around, look beautiful like a show girl?
Down, girl.
Down, girl.
Down, girl!
Little mother Now, Ricky, it's been a long time since I even asked you to be in one of your shows.
Yes, I remember the last time and you said it was going to be your swan song.
Well, it's time for that swan to hit the comeback trail.
That swan's got a little ham in it.
You keep out of this.
Look, I want you to understand this.
You cannot be in this show or in any other show.
Give me one good reason.
I'll give you one good reason.
You're a mother.
I have just as much talent now as I had before the baby was born.
That makes two good reasons.
Your public is waiting for you in there.
Oh.
I guess I better call up and cancel those auditions, huh?
What's the show about?
Never mind!
Ay-ay-ay.
What's the matter?
What?
What's the matter?
Matter?
Oh, nothing, dear.
I'm just sitting here.
What's new?
I'm going down to the club.
Oh, nothing, nothing.
I'm all right.
Good-bye, dear.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, are you leaving?
Good-bye.
Fred, I'm going to go down to the club and call Jerry and tell him to switch the auditions down there.
Hey, I got a great joke you can use.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Do you know the one about the Indian that had to sleep in the hotel lobby because he didn't have a reservation?
No.
How does it go?
Never mind, you wouldn't like it.
Hi.
Oh, my Don't ever do that!
Are you crazy?
Oh, you startled me.
I was reading this book.
Well, it must be some book.
Let me see it.
Good night!
Blood-Curdling Indian Tales.
Oh, you're reading more sophisticated stuff these days, aren't you?
Those were very exciting times.
I- I'm glad I didn't live in them.
Listen- listen to this.
"Then the silhouettes of the Indians appeared on the horizon.
"The pioneer men pushed the women and children back into the wagons.
" Imagine being alone out on the prairie thousands of miles away from any help.
Oh, yeah.
Imagine that.
"The Indians crept closer and closer.
"Fire-tipped arrows pierced the canvas of the first wagon.
"Women fainted.
"Children screamed.
"The Indians were almost upon them.
"They could see their fiendish faces hideously painted- "grotesque in the light of the leaping flames.
"There was a lull as the last groans of the dying men faded.
"Suddenly to the ears of the cowering women and children, "out of the stillness of the night, broke the sound of an Indian war cry.
"    Oh.
It's just the doorbell.
Oh, I was really gone.
I'm telling you, these things can really : Ethel!
Ethel!
My baby, my baby!
Oh, Lucy.
My baby!
There are wild Indians out there!
Wild Indians!
Your imagination has run away with you.
We're surrounded!
We're being attacked!
Indians!
Don't open the door, Ethel.
They'll scalp us.
Lucy wait a minute.
I never thought I'd see you crack up.
What do we do?
!
What do we do?
!
Barricade the door!
Oh, he's a big one.
We better get the Help!
Fred!
Indians!
Look!
Indians!
They tried to scalp us!
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
They tried to scalp us!
What's What's going?
They came right in on us.
Are you dames balmy or something?
No!
These guys are actors.
Actors?
Actors?
!
They're gonna be in Ricky's new show.
Eww They should've gone down to the club.
Why'd you slug 'em?
What?
Why'd you slug 'em?
Why'd we slug 'em?
Uh Oh!
Oh, oh, I was reading a book about Indians, and right in the most exciting part they came in and we just got carried away.
Well, if they're hurt, you might get put away.
Oh, let's see, then.
Help him up, Fred.
We'll help you up.
Mr. Indian.
There you are.
Come on.
Come on.
There.
You okay?
You okay?
Atta boy, chief.
Oh, uh, me heap sorry me smackum on coco.
Huh?
Oh.
Oh, you speak English?
: Certainly I speak English!
What are youse trying to do, murder me?
Oh, no.
No, I'm terribly sorry.
We thought you were someone else.
Well, ain't this Ricardo's place?
Yes, yes.
Oh, and you're supposed to go down to the Tropicana club.
Are you all right?
Well I guess we'll live.
Man, these auditions are getting tougher every day.
Listen, I'm Mrs. Ricardo and I promise that you'll both get the job if if, uh, maybe you'll just forget about this.
Well, okay.
Oh, thank you.
Come on, Herman.
Oh, they were real friendly Indians.
Yeah.
So the show has an Indian theme, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, hey, I played Hiawatha in a school pageant once.
"By the shores of Gitche Gumee by the, by the shining-big-sea water, stood the wigwam of " Ethel, will you stay with the baby while I go to rehearsal?
No, she won't.
Why won't I?
Well, 'cause Ricky just called and he wants us to come down at the club.
He's got a job for us in the new show.
He has?
On, that's wonderful.
I'm sorry, Lucy.
I'll see you later.
Oh, yeah, maybe you will.
Huh?
Well, I might just stroll down to the club with the baby this afternoon.
Stroll down?
It's miles down there.
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.
It's too far.
Well, so long.
Bye.
Bye.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
That's pretty good for that step.
Now, let's take the whole thing from the top.
Oh, no.
Oh, wait a minute, Rick.
I couldn't do it again, Ricky.
My back's broke.
I'm too tired.
I've had it.
I couldn't go through with it.
Well, you characters, you want to be in show business and you don't want to rehearse.
Oh, my feet.
Why don't you get a whip?
All right, okay, you go over the table and rest for awhile.
I'll try the other number.
Pepin, you go take a smoke.
Go ahead.
All right, let's try the, uh "The Waters of the Minnetonka.
" Is that the number?
That's right, all right.
I want to try the moon effect, too, so get ready with the light, boys.
Juanita, you ready?
Okay, Rick.
Marco, ready?
Here we go.
I'll give you two, huh?
One, two.
Moon Dear How near?
You're So Di-vine.
Sun Dear Dear No No Fear  In heart Of mine.
Sky is blue For you Look down In love Waves bright Give light As love May do.
Hear Thou My Vow Vow  To live To-night!
Oh, that was wonderful.
That's great, Rick.
That's great.
You like it, huh?
Good.
All right.
Listen, take it easy going down there.
I love those repeats, that was very That's my favorite my favorite part.
Watch it now.
This is kind of tricky getting out of here, you know.
Your voice sounds wonderful, Juanita.
Thank you.
That's nice.
That's nice, boys.
Nice and soft like that.
Now, listen, we've got a lot of work to do because we've got to open this thing tomorrow afternoon.
Tomorrow afternoon?
That's right.
Whoever heard of nightclub opening in the afternoon?
Well, the place is sold for a benefit- a women's club benefit.
Besides, it'll give us a good chance to break in the act.
Gee, Ricky, that's the only time I've got to spend with my baby.
Well, honey, you'll make some extra money.
You can buy the kid a defense bond, all right?
Okay.
All right.
Now, let's see.
What kind of an act can I get to fill in while I change my costume for that peace pipe number?
Well "By the shores of Gitche Gumee, "by the shining big-sea-water, "stood the wigwam of Nokomis "daughter of the moon, Nokomis.
"Bright before it beats the water, "beats the clear and sunny water, "beats the shining big-sea-water.
"Dark before it loomed the forest, "loomed the black and gloomy pine trees, "loomed the fir with cones upon them.
"There the wrinkled old Nokomis nursed the little Hiawatha.
" As I was saying what kind of an act can I get?
Now, Ricky.
Look, you know what my answer is and I don't want to hear another word about it.
But, honey, you didn't even give me a chance to show you what I can really do.
Well, why don't you leave your name and address with the secretary.
Come on, let's check our costume.
Let's go.
We got a lot of work.
Let's get moving here.
Juanita.
Juanita, it sure is a shame you can't spend any time with your baby tomorrow afternoon.
I- I know just how you feel now that we have a child.
Uh-huh.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could figure out some way that the show could go on and you could still spend time with your baby?
It would be terrific.
Well, now, if we just put our heads together, I'm sure that we're going to be able to figure out  Ug!
A medicine man I met Said don't get yourself in a sweat  When things go wrong just shrug and say  It must've been something I et.
Hey, if your temper is getting in the top hat All you got to do is just stop and Pass that peace pipe and bury that tomahawk.
Like those Choctaws, Cherokees and Chippewas do.
If you're feeling mad as a wet hen Mad as you can possibly get  Then pass that peace pipe, bury that tomahawk Like those Choctaws, Cherokees and Chippewas do.
Don't be cranky Give yourself a little restraint Fold that hanky  And wash off all that war paint And if you find yourself in a fury Be your own judge, don't land in no jury Pass that peace pipe and bury that tomahawk Like those Seminoles, chewchews, babalus do Like those Choctaws, Cherokees and Chippewas do.
Ug!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
How!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Gracias, gracias.
Thank you very much, ladies.
And now we'd like to give you our version of one of the most beautiful Indian numbers ever written- "The Waters of the Minnetonka.
"  Moon Dear : How near You're so Di-vine.
Come here I Uh-uh.
In  Heart Of mine.
Sky is blue For you Look down In love Waves bright In love  And sun The moon Hear Hear Thou Thou My Vow To Live Who's taking care of the baby?

Oh, good morning, Mrs. Trumbull.
Morning.
Well!
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, Mrs. Ricardo Happy birthday to you.
Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Trumbull, but today isn't my birthday.
It isn't?
No.
But I wrote the date down when the Mertzes gave you that birthday party last year.
Can't understand how I could have made such a mistake.
When is your birthday?
Never.
What?
I had my last birthday a year ago today.
Oh.
So you've reached that point.
Mm-hmm.
I know how you feel.
I stopped having birthdays when I was your age.
At least I think I was your age.
How old are you?
How old were you when you stopped?
Well, my last birthday was my 29th.
You were just my age.
That's what I figured.
I was 34 at the time.
Well, if it isn't your birthday, I'll take back my song.
Well, thank you very much.
It was a very nice song, but I just don't want anything to remind me it's my birthday.
Gee, I wonder how I can keep Ricky from remembering.
Just don't tell him.
Mrs. Trumbull, I'll have you know that Ricky never forgets my birthday.
Why, this is the most important day of the year to him.
Well, that's nice.
Really.
Lucy!
Yes, dear?
Have I got any clean handkerchiefs?
Uh, in the top drawer.
You just watch what a big fuss he makes.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Trumbull.
Good morning, Mr. Ricardo.
Honey, I'm in a hurry, so I'll eat breakfast on the way down to the club.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Good-bye.
What are you looking for, dear?
Well, I got something for you.
You have?
Yeah.
Oh, here it is.
I broke the crystal to my watch.
Will you take it to the jewelers for me, please?
Oh, sure, sure.
Thanks.
Well, he's probably going to buy my present downtown today and he'll bring it home with him when he comes home to dinner tonight.
Yes.
Honey?
Oh, yes, dear?
I almost forgot what day this is.
You did?
I got an extra rehearsal at the club, so I won't be able to be home for dinner.
Now, don't feel too bad, Mrs. Ricardo.
Remember, you wanted him to forget your birthday.
Sure I wanted him to forget my birthday, but he forgot my birthday!
Hi, Rick, come on in.
No, Fred, I'm in a hurry.
Look, I just wanted to check.
Did you order the cake?
We certainly did.
It's got pink roses and a great big heart with "Happy Birthday, Lucy" written right on top of it.
Oh, gee, that's just wonderful.
Oh, you should have seen her just now.
She was just about to cry because she thinks that I've forgotten her birthday.
Well, we'll make up for it tonight and everybody said they could come.
Let me see, there's the Orsattis, the Sedgwicks, the Morgans and the Van Blacks.
Wonderful, wonderful.
I got a big ringside table at the club I'm getting all fixed up real pretty.
And I wrote a special song just for Lucy.
A song?
Yeah.
No kidding?
Yeah.
Oh, great.
Now, look, look, will you tell Ethel to keep it quiet?
You mean old blabbermouth?
Yeah.
Don't worry, she won't say a word.
Okay.
I'll see you later, Fred.
Thanks a lot.
So long, Rick.
Bye.
Oh, my dear, you mustn't brood because your husband acted that way.
I'm not brooding.
I'm really glad that Ricky forgot my birthday.
It's just that it makes him look so bad in comparison to all my other friends who think enough of me to remember, like you and Ethel Mertz and all the rest.
Mrs. Trumbull would you stay here with Little Ricky while I go downstairs for a while?
Why, certainly I will.
You know I I guess I am feeling a little low about Ricky and all the fuss that Ethel will make over my birthday will kind of cheer me up a little, to say nothing of the nice present she has undoubtedly bought me.
All right, I'll stay with the baby just as long as you want.
Thank you.
Now, don't rush.
No, I won't, thanks.
Oh.
Oh, Ethel.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi.
I was just coming down to see you.
You were?
Uh-huh.
Why?
Oh, I just wanted to say hello.
Oh.
Hello.
What did you want to see me about?
I brought up your mail.
Oh, is that all?
Yeah, there wasn't much for anybody today.
I mean, there wasn't anything else on your mind?
Nope.
No?
Well, let's see what's in the mail.
Oh oh, this looks like a card of some kind.
You know, a happy- something-or-other card.
Isn't this exciting?
What's the matter?
Wasn't it exciting?
Not unless you want to go to the opening of Joe's Delicatessen.
Oh.
Well, guess I'd better be running along.
Oh, no.
No, sit down.
Let's chat.
Okay.
What's new?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing.
What's new with you?
Nothing.
Not a thing.
You know, I have a strange feeling that today is some special day or something.
You know, like I'd forgotten something.
Oh, I've had that feeling.
Isn't it annoying?
Yeah.
What could it be?
Well, it must be something important.
Gee, I can't imagine what it could be, Lucy.
Oh!
What?
I got a date at the beauty parlor in I got to get my hair fixed up for tonight.
Tonight?
Um yes, Fred and I are going to go out with the head of his lodge to dinner.
Oh, that's nice.
Well, so long, Lucy.
Good-bye.
Oh, didn't Mrs. Mertz remember your birthday either?
She sure didn't.
In fact, she made Ricky's "didn't" look like a "did.
"  Here, now, you just have a good, good cry.
Well, crying won't do any good.
It won't change things any.
Oh, fine, now I got the hiccups.
Try holding your breath; that ought to stop them.
No.
That never does any good.
I always get the hiccups when I cry.
Ever since I was a little  girl.
Well, hold your breath for 20 seconds, that'll stop it.
It never does any good.
Oh, yes, it will.
Come on, I'll prove it to you now.
Let's try.
All right.
Now, when I say "go," you take a deep, long breath.
All right.
Go.
Not yet.
Not yet.
People don't realize how long it is.
Well, this watch isn't even going.
Oh!
Well, anyway, it made you forget your troubles.
It did not.
You know what I'm going to do?
What?
I'm going to give myself a birthday party.
Now, that's a good idea.
Will you come?
I certainly will.
It's going to be a gay party, too- everybody all dressed up, formal.
Fine.
I'm going to ask all my good friends- the Orsattis, the Sedgwicks and the Morgans and the Van Blacks.
I'll get my dress out of the trunk.
It's been there so long, it's back in style again.
Oh, good.
Say, have you ever met a girl who's the toast of the town?
A work of art without a question You better write her number down.
Okay, boys, that's all right.
Be sure you watch those last brass figures there.
Bite 'em off real good, eh?
Now, let's have everything just right tonight, fellas.
It's Lucy's birthday and I got a surprise party for her.
I want everything to be perfect.
Hey, Rick!
Oh, hi, Fred.
Everything's all set.
Did you get the cake?
Yeah all right, bring it in.
Did you ever see a cake like that in your life?
Oh, isn't that the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?
Isn't that a beauty?
Look at the candles.
Oh, and that frosting.
"Happy birthday, Lucy.
" Oh, she's going to get a big mmm.
She's going to get a big kick out of that.
Look at those colors, yeah.
Isn't that beautiful?
Oh, Mrs. Trumbull.
Well, I'm early, I see.
Oh, dear, I forgot to call you.
I couldn't get anyone to come to my party, Mrs. Trumbull.
What do you mean you couldn't get anyone to come?
I'm here.
Well Little Ricky's here.
Why, we can have a wonderful party just the three of us.
You can't have a real party without paper hats.
There's one for you and one for me : and one for Little Ricky.
Oh, he looks so cute.
Well, um now, let's throw some of this around, give it a gay atmosphere.
Whee!
Whee!
Whee!
Whee.
Oh oh Isn't this fun?
Yeah, I guess so.
Uh I sure appreciate everything you've done, Mrs. Trumbull.
The cake and all, it's very nice.
It's just that I guess I'm not much in a party mood.
Mrs. Trumbull, would you stay with Little Ricky again?
I'd like to take a walk.
All right, dear, you go right ahead.
Thank you.
Don't you worry.
I'll take care of Little Ricky, all right.
Okay, thank you.
And hurry back so we can cut the cake.
Yeah.
Tropicana.
I'd like to speak to Mr. Ricardo, please.
Mr. Ricardo?
Yes, he's around somewhere.
Just a moment.
Oh, Ricky.
Yeah?
On the phone, please.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hello.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
What?
You y-y-you man, you!
Who is this?
It's Mrs. Trumbull.
Mrs. Trumbull!
Thanks to you, your poor little wife is crying her eyes out, and even now, she's walking the streets brokenhearted.
What are you talking about?
Today happened to be your wife's birthday.
Oh, I know that, I know it.
I got a wonderful surprise party all fixed up for her.
You have?
Why, sure.
I was just about to call the apartment and ask her to bring me down some music that I left on top of the piano.
Now, what are you talking about her walking the streets?
Well, I guess I exaggerated, but oh, she was so upset.
She went out for a walk.
Oh, gee, I didn't want that to happen.
Well, look, Mrs. Trumbull, as soon as she comes back, tell her that I called and that I want her to bring me some music that I left on top of the piano right down to the club.
All right, Mr. Ricardo.
And don't you worry, I'll stay with the baby.
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Trumbull.
You're a real doll.
Muchas gracias.
Adios, amigo.
Friends, I think we have found here a poor, lonely soul who needs our help.
Oh, you mean me?
Indeed we do, my dear.
We who know what it is to be lonely, cast off and forgotten, bring you friendship.
Oh, well, thanks just the same, but I'm all right.
Well, open up your heart and let our friendship in.
We know what it is to have to spend the night on a park bench.
Oh, you've got me all wrong.
I'm all right, I got plenty of money.
We're sure of that.
No, really,  I'm loaded.
We're sure of that, too.
Oh!
Oh, no, you don't understand.
You see, I always get the hiccups when I cry, and, well, I I've been crying.
I don't know why I should tell you, but well, today was my birthday and nobody even Oh, it's her birthday.
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Lucy.
Lucy Happy birthday to you.
Oh, thank you very much.
That's very nice.
Thanks.
You don't have any friends, do you?
No, I don't.
Well, you have friends now.
Come with us, my dear.
Oh, no, I couldn't.
Oh, you still don't trust us, do you?
Well, it isn't that I don't trust Is there anyone here among us who would like to tell of his experience with The Friends of the Friendless?
I would like to do that, sir.
I would like to tell you of something that happened to me and the lesson I learned and the meaning of true friendship.
I didn't have a friend in the world.
I was just a bit of flotsam in the sea of life, a pitiful outcast shunned by my fellow man.
I was a mess.
And then one day they came along- these good people- unasked, The Friends of the Friendless.
And they put their arm around my waist and they said, "We will be your friend "because you are friendless "and we are The Friends of the Friendless.
"And if you accept our friendship, "you will never again be friendless, "for we are The Friends of the Friendless and you will have friends.
" To this day, I have never been friendless.
I have friends friends in the time of joy friends in the time of sorrow real friends true friends friends.
Friends.
My friends.
You will come with us?
No.
No, I want you to go with me.
There's someone I want to give a lesson to in the true meaning of friendship.
Of course.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
You're a wonderful audience.
Those were Pugh and Carroll- the two greatest contortionists in America today.
And now, we'd like to introduce   We are friends of the friendless Yes, we are, yes, we are.
We are friends of the friendless Be they near, be they far.
We uplift the poor downtrodden And we sober up the sodden We are friends of the friendless Yes, we are, yes, we are.
I want to tell you all something that happened to me, the lesson I learned tonight and the true meaning of friendship.
These people are my friends, The Friends of the Friendless.
And I was friendless.
I was just a bit of flotsam in the sea, a pitiful outcast shunned by my fellow man.
I was a mess.
The people I thought were my friends forsook me.
Even my own husband proved he was just a husband and not a friend.
Today was my birthday, and do you think anybody remembered?
Nobody remembered.
Nobody did a thing about it.
Nobody even as much not a sing  Happy birthday!
Ethel!
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
Happy birthday?
Happy birthday for me?
Yeah, honey, we didn't forget your birthday.
We had this thing planned for weeks.
We just couldn't get a hold of you- you had run out of the house.
Nobody could find you.
Oh, no!
Oh, honey.
And I got a wonderful present for you.
You want to hear it?
Hear it?
Yeah.
I love Lucy and she loves me We're as happy as two can be Sometimes we quarrel, but then How we love making up again.
Lucy kisses like no one can She's my missus and I'm her man And life is heaven, you see 'Cause I love Lucy Yes, I love Lucy And Lucy loves me.
Everybody sing!

{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Oh.
Hi, Lucy.
Oh, hi.
Look around, Ethel.
You wouldn't know there was a baby in this apartment, would you?
Well, I might get a slight clue from that bundle you're carrying in your arms.
No, I mean you wouldn't know that a baby lived here, you know, with all the things you have to have for a baby.
Just by looking at this room you wouldn't notice that.
You know, a high chair and a crib and diapers and bottles and bottle warmers and toys.
So, what's your point?
So, it just shows what you can do with a little system.
I had to find a place for everything if we're going to be stuck in this apartment.
What do you mean, "stuck"?
Well, I've been trying to convince Ricky that we need a larger apartment now that we have the baby, but I can't get anywhere with him.
Well, I'm glad.
I don't want you moving away, and I haven't got a bigger apartment that's vacant.
Well, it wouldn't matter if you did.
Ricky says we can't afford it.
Yeah, honey.
Well, you sure did a good job of putting everything away, honey.
I came up to borrow a cup of sugar.
Will you loan it to me?
Yeah.
What a matter?
Here's your sugar.
Lucy Hmm?
I might be slightly confused because I've only lived in this building 16 years, but isn't the kitchen that way?
Yeah.
Well, do you always keep the sugar in the bedroom?
Oh, it wasn't in the bedroom; it was in the bathroom.
You see, I found a place for each thing, but when I came to the sugar, the kitchen was all full.
Uh-huh.
Well, thanks for the sugar.
I got to go bake my cake.
Oh, that reminds me, I got to get a roast in the oven.
So long.
Bye.
Lucy, I'm home.
Oh, hi, honey.
Oh, hi.
Lucy.
Yeah?
There's no room in the closet for my coat.
Nonsense- I reorganized the entire apartment today and there is a place for everything.
You're right.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What am I going to do with this?
I guess you'll just have to wear it.
Listen, have I got time before dinner to do some work?
I'll say.
Lucy!
Yeah?
What are all my socks doing in the desk?
I'm keeping them there now.
Your underwear is in the other drawer.
So what happened to the dresser?
I had to have more room for the baby's things.
I'm putting things away for three now, dear.
All right, all right, all right, all right, okay.
Ay, quÃ© barbaridad!
Mira, Â¿quÃ© tienen las cosas?
, los juguetes aquÃ­ y las medias allÃ­ los calzoncillos allÃ¡ y no se puede sentar en la casa Temper, temper temper.
Why don't you put these things away where they belong?
Gladly- where do they belong?
Well, there must be some better place to put all this junk than under the cushions in the living room.
Not in this stuffy little crackerbox.
Ricky, I worked very hard finding a place for everything.
You don't realize what a problem it is.
After all, I'm only human.
I can only do so much, you know.
All right, all right, all right, all right!
Let's not go through that again.
Go through what again?
: "This apartment is entirely too small "for the two of us and little Ricky, and if we don't move to a larger apartment, I'll go crazy.
" Well, I'm glad you finally agreed with me.
Never mind that.
Now, look, honey, I know it's crowded here, and I would love to move just as much as you would, but we can't afford it.
Can't afford it!
Can't afford it!
That's all you ever say anymore.
Well, we can't afford it!
There you go again!
Well, we can't!
Well, I can't afford to work so hard either.
You don't know how tough it is.
I'm wasting away to nothing.
Well, you're the fattest nothing I've ever seen.
Well!
Now, look, we are staying right here and that's all there is to it.
Hey, I forgot to tell you Well, I'll see you later.
Wait a minute, Ethel.
Come back here.
I'm just trying to reason with Mr. Ricky Ricardo, the Cuban skinflint.
Hey, I came up to tell you something.
You know the Bensons that live in 3B?
Yeah.
Their daughter got married this afternoon.
Really?
Yeah, I just saw Mr. and Mrs. Benson in the hall.
They both reacted in the strangest way to their daughter's wedding- she was crying and he was laughing.
He probably thought that he would never unload her.
Oh, I'll have Mrs. Benson crying on my shoulder for months.
Every time she faces her daughter's empty room, she'll rush right Empty room.
They've got an extra room they don't need!
Oh, gee, I hope they don't move.
I hope they do.
Why, Lucy!
That way we could move to a larger apartment and still stay in the building.
Yeah, but we'd lose a tenant.
Oh.
Maybe they'll trade.
Hey, that's a wonderful idea.
Do you think they'd do it?
Now, wait a minute.
There's no harm in asking them.
I bet we could talk them into it.
That would just be ideal.
Lucy.
We could take their daughter's room, make it into the nursery.
I know just how the furniture would go.
And then she wouldn't Ethel.
have to face that empty room  I "wun't swish aparments.
" Did you understand what I said?
All right.
What did I say?
You "wun't swish aparments.
" "Buh" why?
Look, the Bensons' apartment is larger than this apartment.
Therefore, it must cost more than this apartment.
$20 a month more.
You see?
Now, there you are.
Now, I told you, I would love to move just as much as you would, but we can't afford it.
I know, I know.
Those must be the first English words you ever learned.
Ricky, I know this isn't any of my business, but Lucy is awful crowded here, and, well, you know there is that extra room downstairs Ethel, Ethel, never mind.
Ricky is right.
After all, Ricky is my husband, he's little Ricky's father, and I respect his judgment.
In all the years that we've been married, I've never known him to be anything but generous and kindhearted and wonderful.
Kiss me.
I can't afford it.
What do you mean, you can't afford it?
That kiss will cost me $20 a month.
You don't love me anymore, Ricky!
You don't care how hard I work!
You don't care if little Ricky is so crowded that he can't even move around!
: I do, too, Lucy!
I love you very much and I care that little Ricky is so crowded and I think it's terrible Oh, shut up!
Come on, Ethel!
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!
Ay!
Hi.
Any new developments since last night?
No.
Is there anything you can think of that we can do to help you, Lucy?
Anything?
Anything at all?
No.
Thanks, Fred.
We'll just have to go on living exactly the way we are.
Little Ricky is going to get awfully cramped sleeping in that crib until he's 21 years old.
Gee, I wish there was something we could do.
Of course, it's just the extra rent that stands in the way.
If we could get the Benson apartment for the same amount of money that we pay here, there wouldn't be any problem.
Don't you think that possibly?
Maybe you could?
No.
It wouldn't be fair to the other tenants.
Oh I guess you're right, Fred.
We'll just have to stay the way we are until we get so crowded we can't turn around.
Can't turn around.
What are you talking about?
What a dope I've been!
Of course Ricky is willing to stay here if I break my back putting everything away.
I've been doing everything all wrong.
Look at that gleam in her eye.
Lucy?
Yes, dear?
Hey, what is all this stuff?
What's this thing doing here?
That's little Ricky's slide.
Oh, no, come on, now, Lucy!
What's going on?
Nothing, dear.
Just a few things we needed for the baby and I didn't have any other place to put them.
Lucy!
Oh, I know it's crowded, dear, but you'll just have to bear with it if we're going to stay in this teensy apartment.
Lucy, I sw How am I supposed to get in here?
Be my guest.
Look out for the Super Chief!
Na-na-na!
Na-na-na-na!
Na-na-na, na-na-na!
Here we go, whoo-whoo!
Whoo-whoo!
Whoo-whoo.
Lucy, I know what you're up to and we are not going to move!
Well, if you want to live like this.
You are going to take all this stuff back.
No, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are.
No, I'm not.
Oh, yes, you are, and not only that, but I'm going to put you on top of my knee and spank you.
Well, you have to catch me first.
Oh-oh-oh!
Ricky!
Ricky, you're making me dizzy!
Ricky!
Oh, Ricky, you're making me dizzy!
Ricky!
Oh!
Oh, Ricky!
Ow, Ricky!
I'll take them back, I'll take them back!
Ricky!
Good morning, Mrs. Benson.
Hello, Mrs. Ricardo, Mrs. Mertz.
Come in, come in.
We just thought we'd come down and chat a while.
Oh, how nice.
Now, sit down and make yourselves at home.
I was just mixing a meat loaf.
Oh, it smells good.
Oh, thank you.
I'll be right with you.
Oh, take your time.
Take your time.
Gee, won't this be a wonderful place for us to live in?
It'll be a wonderful place for you to recuperate in when Ricky finds out what you're up to.
Oh, he won't mind.
I just used the wrong approach last night, that's all.
But I'm going to take all those toys back.
Even if you do talk Mrs. Benson into switching apartments with you, this apartment is still going to cost Ricky an extra $20 a month.
It isn't going to cost Ricky anything.
It's going to cost me $20 a month.
I'm going to scrimp and save and pay it out of my allowance.
You're already drawn on your allowance seven months in advance!
Oh, you'll never be able to pay me.
I will, too.
If I were smart, I'd let you have this place for the same price; then we could still stay friends.
Yeah!
But I'm not that smart.
Well, then you just have to help me work on Mrs. Benson.
Okay.
Now, after all, it's for her own good.
She won't have to worry about her daughter being gone Sorry to keep you waiting.
Oh.
Well, now, there we are.
Uh, how have you been, Mrs. Benson?
Oh, fine, just fine.
It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?
Wonderful.
Don't you just love the spring?
Uh-huh.
Mmm!
Congratulations on your daughter's marriage.
Uh  My baby, my baby!
Oh Oh, the thorns of motherhood.
Oh, poor Mrs. Benson.
Yes, poor Mrs. Benson.
She's left me, my little baby.
Oh, well, don't feel too badly, Mrs. Benson, she'll come to see you often.
Oh, no, she won't.
And I'm all alone.
Oh, well, you still have Mr. Benson.
Eh!
Oh, I I feel so sorry for Mrs. Benson, rattling around in this big apartment and her daughter's room standing there empty, reminding her that she's all alone.
Oh, I know.
What?
Um, this is a big sacrifice to make, but I can't stand to see her suffer.
Our apartment would be just perfect for the Bensons.
Why, yes, it's just the right size.
No, no, no, I couldn't, I couldn't It's $20 a month cheaper.
Oh?
Well, Mr. Benson would like that.
Oh, yeah, when do we switch?
Today?
Oh, no, no, my dear.
I couldn't do it today.
You see, I'll be out all day helping my baby get settled.
She'll get no help from that nincompoop she's married.
Well, why don't you give me the key and I'll have everything all fixed up when you come back?
Oh, my dear, now, I don't know.
What about the moving?
Isn't that very expensive?
Oh, well, don't you worry about it.
I'll take care of everything.
As a matter of fact, some of my best friends are furniture movers.
Really?
Oh, that's wonderful.
I certainly appreciate all you're doing.
Oh, that's all right.
Bless you.
Well, I'll go and get you the key.
All right.
: Oh, dear.
If you think I'm going to help you carry all of this furniture Shh be quiet.
We'll talk about it later.
You want us to stay here, don't you?
Yes, but I'm not going to help you carry all this furniture back and forth Fred will.
Fred wouldn't touch a piece of it.
What do you mean?
Well, we're ready.
Oh, shh!
I told you not to come up here until he had left.
Now, go on.
I'll pound on the floor when I want you.
Go on.
All right.
Hurry up, before he sees you.
You better hurry, dear, you'll be late for rehearsal.
No, I got plenty of time.
What are you going to do today?
Why do you ask that?
I just thought you could take my tux to the cleaners.
Oh oh, sure, sure, sure.
I haven't got a thing to do.
I'm just going to be sitting around, resting, relaxing.
Well, good-bye, dear.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Uh My foot went to sleep.
I forgot my music.
Oh.
Don't be late for your rehearsal, dear.
Oh, listen, honey, there's something I want to talk to you about.
What, dear?
Well, you know, I've been thinking the whole situation about moving and everything, you know, and really I want you to understand that I would like to very much, but you don't seem to realize I do realize, dear No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
I understand exactly.
You don't Yes, I do, dear, good-bye.
Let's get started.
Hey, where's the baby?
Mrs. Trumbull is going to take care of him today.
Now, okay, everybody grab something up here, take it downstairs, pick up something downstairs, bring it up here and keep on going till we get everything switched around in both apartments.
Now, come on.
All right.
Well, my back has been bothering me lately.
You've been using that same gag for years.
Come on, now, and do a man's work.
Lucy, give him that coffee table.
That's too heavy for you.
There, that's better.
Yeah!
Come on.
Watch out, now.
Take it easy.
All right.
Take it easy going around that corner.
Don't scratch anything, now, Fred.
Watch your fingers.
Gee, this is heavy, isn't it?
Where do you want this?
Oh, right there, thank you.
Hey, we're pretty fast movers, aren't we?
Yeah, we're the busy little bees, all right.
Well, let's not lose any time, busy bees.
Buzz on up and get some more furniture.
All right, all right.
Say, Lucy.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but we've been moving for three hours now and there's one member of our little moving firm that I haven't passed on the stairs lately.
Has Fred goofed off?
I wasn't referring to Fred.
Well, Ethel, you certainly don't mean me.
Don't I?
Why, I've been working like a Trojan overseeing things.
Someone's got to be in charge.
Well, let's take turns being in charge.
Well!
Apparently one of our busy bees is a sorehead.
Well, apparently one of our busy bees thinks she's the queen.
All right, all right.
Don't get your stinger out of joint.
You just relax.
I'll move all the rest of my furniture myself.
Everything!
Well, this is the last of it.
Nice timing.
Oh, come on, now, let's not get mad.
We're all finished.
Let's all go down to the corner drugstore and relax over an ice cream soda.
I'll buy.
Well, you talked me into it.
Come on.
You know, I may have a sandwich and a piece of apple pie.
With whipped cream- I'm hungry, huh?
Ricky will just love this apartment once he gets What happened?
How did the Benson furniture get back in here?
I can't understand it!
I didn't have anything stronger than an ice cream soda.
Hi.
I can't Hi.
How do you like it?
How do I like what?
Oh.
Oh, they didn't get here, huh?
Who didn't get here?
Honey, I had a wonderful surprise for you, but I guess they didn't get here, so I might as well tell you.
Tell me what?
I got Mr. Benson's okay, and then I called Mrs. Trumbull and asked her to call me as soon as you left the apartment, and then I called the movers and told them to rush over here and switch all the furniture from our apartment to this apartment and all the furniture from this apartment to Ew Ew Ew  WGBH access.

It's your bid, Ethel.
Uh, one club.
Say, did you see that dress Sylvia Collins had on at the dance Saturday night?
Yeah, what there was of it.
Uh one heart.
One no trump.
How do you suppose she held it up?
Two diamonds.
Who knows?
All I know is every man in the room was waiting for her to exhale.
I'll say.
Fred's eyes bugged out like a bullfrog with an overactive thyroid.
Uh, I pass.
Hey, how about the attention that Sylvia Collins got from our husbands?
How about that?
Uh, I pass.
Pass.
I get it for two diamonds.
Put your cards down, girl.
You know, she didn't light her own cigarette once.
Every time I looked up, some man was racing across the room with a lighted match.
Looked like the start of the Olympic games.
Yeah, the indoor cigarette lighting sprint.
I didn't know my little fat torchbearer could run that fast.
Well, of all the countries represented, Cuba seemed to be taking the most first prizes.
And just what do you mean by that?
Well, it wasn't my husband who taught her how to play "Babalu" on an upturned wastebasket.
Now, just a minute.
Girls, girls, come on.
Are we going to play bridge, or aren't we?
Well Oh, it's getting to be the same old story every time we play cards: Sylvia Collins, Sylvia Collins, Sylvia Collins.
Well, why not?
She's the biggest female wolf in our crowd.
Yeah.
The way she attracts men.
She's not so beautiful.
No.
What's she got that we haven't got?
No husband.
Hey, I know how to cure this situation.
How?
Don't you see?
The men are intrigued by Sylvia because she's single.
This makes her mysterious and exciting.
We have to find Sylvia a husband.
Good idea.
A husband?
A husband?
Yeah, it's our only chance.
Now, where can we find her a husband?
I'll make the sacrifice.
She can have mine.
Now, Ethel.
Is it agreed, then?
The four of us will dedicate ourselves to getting Sylvia Collins a husband.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Okay.
Oh, look, there's going to be a wedding.
There we go.
Yeah.
It's all gone.
You don't have to take any more, honey, no.
You want to give Mama a big burp, huh?
Give me a big burp.
Come on, great big one.
Oh, come on, give Mama a big burp.
Oh, oh that's a good one, honey.
Oh, my.
You're getting to be such a big boy.
Yes, sir.
Oh, come on, now.
Just going to go sleepy-bye.
You're going to go sleepy-bye, that's all.
Isn't it wonderful?
Honey, you got your own little bed in your own little room.
Oh, come on now.
Hi, honey.
Here's your Papa.
Time to kiss him good night.
Ah, what's the matter?
What's the matter?
Aw, come on.
Were you a good boy today?
Say "Yes, Daddy.
" Ahh Come on.
Were you a good girl?
Yes, Daddy.
Yes.
Yes, daddy.
You're going to go bye?
You're going to go to bed?
Say, "Yes, Daddy.
" Good night.
I'll be out in a minute, honey.
Oh, he's such a tired boy.
He doesn't want to go to sleep, that's all.
Well Come on, honey.
Good night, boy.
Go say, "Goodnighty night, Papa.
" There we go, honey.
Now, come on, it's time you were in bed.
Little sleepy boy.
Come on, now, you go sleepy-bye.
Honey, we're going to have a little company.
Company?
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell me?
Oh, I forgot about it.
It's a friend of Fred's, and he and Ethel are going to be late getting home so they asked me if we would entertain him till they get here.
Who is it?
I don't know.
Some traveling salesman or something.
He's a nephew of one of Fred's old buddies, and since he's a bachelor, they thought that he would like a home-cooked meal.
Oh, that's all very nice, but I A bachelor?
And young, too.
Oh, boy!
Real live bachelor, right here in my own trap.
What are you so excited about?
You're married, remember?
Oh, don't be silly.
He sounds like the perfect man for Sylvia Collins.
You see, the girls in the club have decided that we should find Sylvia a husband.
Now, Lucy, lay off this guy, will you?
Why is it that every married woman thinks it's their sacred duty to marry off every single guy?
Oh, we do not.
Well, see that you don't.
After all, if this guy is fortunate enough to still be single, I don't What?
I, uh I didn't mean it that way.
I mean, if he's smart enough to still be How's that?
There must be some word that describes what I'm trying to say.
The word is "stupid.
" All right, stupid.
If the guy's stupid enough to still be single, leave him alone.
That's better.
After all, ignorance is bliss.
You let Sylvia Collins get her own husband.
I wouldn't mind if she got her own, but she's getting everybody else's.
There he is.
I got to put my face on.
Now, Lucy, don't forget what I told you.
I don't want to hear one word that sounds like matchmaking.
Oh, now, Ricky I mean it.
Oh, all right.
All right.
Mr. Ricardo?
Yeah.
I'm Eddie Grant, Fred Mertz's friend.
Oh, yeah, how are you, Eddie?
Come on in, won't you?
Sit down.
Thank you.
Fred will be here in a little while.
Fine.
Would you like a cigarette?
Yeah, swell, thank you.
You're welcome.
Nice apartment.
Thank you, Eddie.
Listen, uh, Fred says that you just got in town.
Yeah, I'm on a sales trip.
Oh!
What do you sell?
Negligees.
Oh Oh, dear, I didn't know you had company.
Eddie, this is my wife, Lucy.
Lucy, this is Eddie Grant.
How do you do?
How do you do, Mrs. Ricardo?
Are you a native New Yorker?
No, no, as a matter of fact, I'm on a sales trip.
It's the first time in several years.
Oh, my.
I'll bet your wife is having a gay time in all the shops.
No, no, I'm not married.
Not married?
A big, handsome, intelligent man like you not married?
Well, Eddie, how do you like it here in New York City?
I know just what you need, Mr. Grant Eddie.
What?
How would you like to have a beautiful girl to take you around and show you the town?
Go dancing Lucy, leave Eddie alone.
Eddie, Fred tells me that your uncle was in show business with him.
Oh, speaking of show business, you'll want to see all the big Broadway shows.
and it'd be just ridiculous if you went alone.
Wouldn't you like someone to share all that fun with you?
Lucy, that'll be enough.
Eddie, what kind of an act did your uncle have?
He did a magic act.
Sawed a woman in half.
Oh, no kidding?
Have you ever stopped to think how nice it would be to have a woman of your own to saw in half?
No, but I have.
Well, hi, Eddie boy.
Oh, Fred, how are you?
Glad to see you.
It's good to see you.
Sorry we weren't in.
That's all right.
The Ricardos took good care of me.
Oh, it was a pleasure.
Well, let's get going- Ethel's waiting.
Bye, Mr. Ricardo.
Nice meeting you.
Nice to have met you, Mrs. Ricardo.
Nice to have met you.
Oh, I think I'll go with you.
I want to say hello to Ethel.
All right.
Lucy, I want you to stay here with me.
Oh, I'll be right back, dear.
I know, honey.
But I'll be lonesome.
Well, I'll only be a minute.
Don't go, dear.
Well, on second thought, maybe I better stay here.
Yes.
Well, good-bye, Eddie.
Have a good time.
You're going to have a wonderful meal.
Ethel really cooks well.
What's the matter with you?
You crazy or something?
I just finished telling you that I don't want you to play cupid and you make us look ridiculous with this guy trying to marry him to somebody he doesn't even know.
How many times am I going to ask you not to meddle in other people's affairs?
If I asked you once, I asked you a thousand times.
Lucy?
Yeah?
Ooh, I wanted to tell you, I tried to come over last night but Ricky just wouldn't let me.
That Eddie Grant is perfect for Sylvia Collins.
I'll say- I went to work on him the minute he walked in.
Did you do any good?
No.
Fred kept kicking me under the table.
We're just going to have to set up a date ourselves.
I'm going to call Sylvia.
Okay.
Let's see.
That's, uh, C-2-2 You know, when I think how I'm sticking my neck out for that bleach blonde in wolf's clothing Sylvia, darling, how are you?
Yeah, this is Lucy.
Oh, fine, thanks.
Look, Sylvia, dear, I just met the most divine, handsome, well-to-do bachelor and he's all alone, doesn't have anyone to show him around town.
Look, sweetie, sweetie, I told him about you and he wants to have lunch with you today.
What's she saying?
Does she like the idea?
She's drooling.
Well, look, dear, can you meet him in the lobby of the Sherry Plaza at noon?
Yeah, well, just ask for him at the desk.
His name is Eddie Grant.
That's right.
Oh, he's just dreamy.
You'll swoon.
Okay, bye-bye.
Well, that takes care of the spider- now for the fly.
Hello.
Hello, Eddie.
This is Lucy.
Lucy Ricardo.
Oh, hi, how are you?
Oh, just fine, thanks.
I'll bet you didn't expect to hear from me, did you?
Well, not so soon.
Look, Eddie, since you don't know any girls in town, how would you like a date for lunch today?
Oh, I'd like it fine.
But won't your husband mind?
Oh, no, you don't understand.
I was talking about someone else.
Mm-hmm.
No, really.
A beautiful girl named Sylvia Collins.
You don't have to pretend with me, Lucy.
Now, look, Eddie, be serious.
If you want to have lunch with Sylvia, I'll arrange to have her meet you in the lobby of your hotel at noontime.
Okay, I'd love it.
I'll be there.
All right, good.
She'll ask for you at the desk.
Good-bye, Eddie.
Good-bye Sylvia.
Well, that takes care of that.
Come out here and help me with the dishes.
I think this is a wonderful idea.
Get me circle 7-2-0-9-9, please.
Hello.
Fred?
This is Eddie Grant.
Oh, hi.
Listen, I'm afraid I won't be able to have lunch with you today after all.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's the matter?
Business?
No, not really.
I've got a date.
That's all right, bring her along.
No, I don't think I should.
Oh, why not?
I want to see what kind of taste you have.
There will only be the four of us.
The four?
Yeah, I've invited Ricky to come.
No, no, Fred, I, uh I couldn't bring her along, no.
What's the matter?
You ashamed of her?
No!
No, no, she's a doll, real dream but to tell you the truth, Fred, she's, uh she's married, you know?
You're the sly one.
Well, I got to hang up now, Fred.
I got a couple of business appointments.
I've got to meet her in the lobby at noon.
See you later.
Good-bye, Eddie.
Tropicana.
Is Ricky Ricardo there?
Yeah, just a moment, please.
Oh, Ricky?
Yeah.
Telephone.
Okay.
Thanks.
Hello.
Hi, Rick?
Yeah, hi, Fred.
Eddie can't make it for lunch.
Oh, that's too bad.
You want to skip it?
Oh, no, no, now here's what I thought.
Uh, he's got a heavy date with some beautiful doll.
Special deal, you know what I mean?
And I thought we might have a little fun.
What do you mean?
Well, we'll wait in the lobby until he meets her and then we'll have a little fun with him.
You old dog.
It's the Sherry Plaza and I'll meet you there at noon.
Okay, they have good food there, so we'll eat there.
All right, good-bye, Rick.
Good-bye, Fred.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
Well, Marion, listen, I expected it.
There just was no other way for that marriage to go.
That's right.
That's right.
What do they expect?
Yeah, well, that's just life, I guess.
Well, look, dear, I'll call you again and we'll have a nice, long chat.
Give my love to Norman, huh?
Okay, dear, bye-bye.
What's the matter?
Do you have any idea how long you've been on that phone?
I certainly do.
I picked up the phone at 9:15.
It is now 11:30.
I have a hairdresser's appointment at Sylvia Collins has been trying to get you for two hours.
She finally had to call me.
What does she want?
She can't make that date with Eddie.
She broke a cap off of a front tooth.
Oh, no- well, can't she go anyway?
With her looks, one tooth isn't going to make any difference.
She won't go.
She says she looks like a beaver.
Oh.
She's been trying to get hold of Eddie but he's not at the hotel.
She could leave a message.
He might not get it, though.
Listen, will you stay here until Mrs. Trumbull gets here to take care of Ricky?
Yeah, why?
Well, I'll stop by on my way to the beauty parlor and I'll tell Eddie myself.
That's the safest way.
Gee, isn't that too bad?
That was such a perfect setup.
Oh, hello, Eddie.
Well, well, well If it isn't Sylvia Collins.
Oh, now, Eddie.
I came down here to tell you that Sylvia couldn't make it.
Oh?
No, now really.
Listen, if you're thinking what I think you're thinking you're way off base.
I'm thinking only one thing.
Hi, Fred.
Hi, Rick, let's go.
Where you going?
I thought you wanted to kid Eddie Grant about his girlfriend.
We haven't got time for that now, I'm hungry.
Well, come on, this is the best place to eat.
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy or something?
Come on, let's go and eat.
Oh, look there's Eddie now.
Fred.
Fred, stop it.
You lost your mind?
Wait a minute.
Oh, no.
Oh, hello, Ricky.
Uh Lucy.
Well.
Uh, Ricky, the Ricky.
Ricky, I can explain if you just give me a chance.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi.
Is Ricky talking to you yet?
No.
I don't see why he should get so upset just because I did a little matchmaking.
I know why.
Fred just told me.
Why?
Well, Eddie thought you were making that date with him for yourself, and being a man, he couldn't help bragging to Ricky and Fred that he had a heavy date.
And Ricky and Fred- also being men- decided to go down there and spy on him.
So Ricky must have thought Oh, no, Ricky was just mad at me because I was matchmaking.
Are you sure?
Well, one thing I'm sure of: we got to get Ricky and Eddie and everybody concerned together so we can explain this thing.
Will you go down to Eddie's hotel with me?
Yes, I think you need a chaperone.
I'll get Mrs. Trumbull to take care of little Ricky.
You get dressed right away.
Okay, I'll get ready.
Hurry up now.
Oh, Eddie, I wanted to Eddie?
Eddie, I wanted to talk to you.
Eddie, let us in, Eddie.
Eddie, open the door.
Come on, now.
Let us in.
Eddie?
Let us in, Eddie.
Oh, girls?
I'm down in 914.
If Eddie won't let you in, I will.
Oh, go away Fresh.
How do you like that?
Fresh.
Eddie?
Hello, Eddie.
Well, I guess we might as well leave.
He isn't going to open the door.
Okay.
Telegram for Mr. Grant.
Eddie, we've got to talk to you.
Eddie, we just got to talk to you, you understand?
Now, Eddie, I've just got to talk to you.
Listen, I'm in a spot because you jumped to some stupid conclusions.
Ethel, get Sylvia on the phone, will you?
Sylvia Collins?
Yes, Sylvia Collins, that very nice girl I tried to get you a date with.
The rest is just a silly coincidence and I want you to please explain it to Ricky.
You want me to explain it to Ricky?
Sylvia, Lucy wants to talk to you.
Just a minute.
Hello, Sylvia dear.
Is your tooth better?
That's good Yes, as a matter of fact I want to introduce you to him right now.
Sylvia Collins, this is Eddie Grant.
Oh, all right.
Hello.
No.
No, she was exaggerating.
Well, I guess it is a little curly.
Oh, just average height.
It's too bad we couldn't get together yesterday, Syl.
Well, how about today?
Wonderful.
I'll be down and get you in about a half hour.
What's that address again?
Swell.
So I'll be right down.
Bye, Sylvia.
Gee, I certainly owe you an apology.
She sounds wonderful.
You see?
You'll bring her here and then we'll go down to the club and explain to Ricky.
Okay, I will.
Incidentally, girls, while I'm gone, I want you to pick out any two negligees you want and I'll let you have them  wholesale.
Well, I'm glad you brought me down here today.
How do you like that Eddie Grant thinking he had a date with Lucy?
Yeah, how about that?
He said 925, didn't he?
Yeah.
I'd be a fine husband if I didn't trust my wife any more than that.
Lucy!
Lucy, open the door!
Open the door!
Now, now, Ricky, I know this looks bad and I can explain I think.
Lucy, you here, dressed in that.
You must be out of your mind.
Who is it, Lucy?
Did Eddie come back?
Ethel!
You here, dressed in that.
He must be out of his mind.
Lucy, did they think that we that I?
Well.
Now, now, Ricky, this is all very simple and I can explain it if you'll just listen.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Well, even though you told me not to, I fixed Eddie up with a date with Sylvia for lunch and then Sylvia couldn't make it and we called Eddie and he wasn't in so I came down to the hotel to tell Eddie and then you saw us and got mad so I had to come down again today and tell Eddie and we called Sylvia and Eddie went over to get her and while he was gone he said if we found some negligees that we wanted we could have them wholesale.
That's exactly what happened.
And it was all my fault and I'm sorry.
You told me not to meddle in other people's affairs and I did and I'm really sorry.
That is the most ridiculous story I've ever heard.
Isn't it, Fred?
I'll say.
Well, that makes me mad.
It makes you mad?
Yes, I tell you the truth, I admit it's all my fault, I practically grovel at your feet and you say you don't believe it.
Come on, come on, tell the real story.
Yeah.
All right, Ethel.
If they want the real story, let's give it to them.
Huh?
They want the truth.
Let's give it to them.
Go ahead.
Oh.
Well Uh You start.
Well, for a long time now Ethel and I have been sick and tired of being married to a stale bongo player and a fat old fuddy-duddy.
A fat old fuddy-duddy?
A fat old fuddy-duddy.
So when Eddie Grant came to town, we realized that that here was the chance of a lifetime.
And then what happened?
Uh And then what happened will amaze you.
Yeah.
So the three of us made plans.
And at midnight tonight, we're all flying to South America.
You were, huh?
What's so funny?
What are you laughing at?
Look, I ran into Eddie Grant downstairs and I straightened him out but good.
So we decided to come up here and teach you a lesson.
Oh, Ricky That's mean.
Come on, Ethel, let's change.
Okay.
Hey, do you think maybe we've suffered enough so that you fellows might buy us these negligees, wholesale?
How much are they?
Good-bye, Lucy.
Good-bye, Ethel.
What do you mean, "good-bye"?
Too much money.
We decided to let you go to South America.
Oh, Fred.
WGBH access.
wgbh.
org  I Love Lucy is a Desilu production.
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz will be back next week at this same time.
This is the CBS television network.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
Shh!
Shh there we go.
Honey, isn't it wonderful that little Ricky has his own room and we got all this space here?
Yeah, wonderful, dear.
I'm sure glad you talked me into moving.
So am I. Look at this beautiful place.
Oh, everything is just great.
Ugh!
What's the matter?
That ratty old couch and that nasty-looking coffee table- they just don't belong in this beautiful room.
Lucy, what's on your mind?
Nothing nothing.
Now that you mention it, though, I did see an ad today for the most beautiful couch and coffee table you've ever seen.
The couch was a three-piece No new couch, no new coffee table.
Finish, closed.
Aw, gee, Ricky, you should look at this ad.
It's the most beautiful couch and coffee table you've ever seen.
It's only $299, and Just forget it.
So, what are you doing that for?
I may have to live with that couch but I don't have to look at it.
I think any normal person feels the way I do.
I'll bet Ethel Mertz thinks that those two pieces are just awful.
Have you been coaching Ethel on what to say?
Certainly not, I haven't even mentioned it.
I'd be ashamed to.
Hi, folks.
Hiya, Fred.
Hi, Lucy.
Hi, Ethel.
Ugh!
Oh, that ratty old couch and that nasty old coffee table- they just don't belong in this Hold it, hold it, hold it, Ethel.
The performance has been canceled.
No new furniture.
Why not?
Ask Mr. Ricardo.
Or as he is more commonly known, SeÃ±or Tightwad.
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll leave it up to an impartial observer.
Fred, what do you think of this couch and this coffee table?
What are you looking for?
The price tag- it's brand-new, isn't it?
Isn't it sickening the way men stick together?
Come on, Ethel, I don't like the atmosphere around here.
"Brand-new, is it?
Where's the price tag"?
"Brand-new.
" Well, it was a good fight, Lucy, but you lost.
Gee, Ethel, this is terrible.
What am I going to do?
What do you mean, what are you going to do?
He isn't going to buy you any new furniture so you'll just have to live with the old.
You don't understand.
I went down to the furniture store this afternoon and, well, there was a big sale on and You didn't.
Yes, I did.
They're delivering it in the morning.
Oh, Lucy!
Do you suppose they accept mothers with children in the Foreign Legion?
Ethel, where have you been?
I've been trying to find you all day.
I had some shopping to do Oh, Lucy!
Oh, it's just beautiful!
No, Ethel!
What's the matter?
Don't sit on it!
Well, that's what it's for, isn't it?
Well, I know, but it's much too pretty to sit on.
Well, all right, but gently, huh?
Ha-ha!
It's comfy, too.
Isn't that wonderful?
You should see the close call I had this morning.
Ricky no sooner closed that door than they delivered the furniture.
They must have passed each other in the hall.
Oh, what are you going to do when he comes home?
Pray.
Well, good-bye, Lucy, it's been nice knowing you.
Now The only plan I have is to hide the furniture.
Hide it?
Yeah, that way, if he doesn't see it the minute he walks in, I may have a chance to soften him up, you know.
Where are you going to hide all this stuff?
Well, the bedroom is no good.
The bathroom no.
Won't fit in that closet.
Let's put it in the kitchen.
He doesn't go in there very often.
In the kitchen?
Yeah, it's the only place.
Come on, help me, will you?
Okay.
Get a hold of the other end.
That's right, now, all together: one, two, three, four!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, I forgot, it's in sections.
Just help me with this piece.
All right.
There.
Ready?
Yeah.
Oh, come on, push, Ethel!
I am pushing.
Well, push harder.
There must be something in the way.
Yeah, my fingers.
Well, I don't understand.
We got the other two sections out here all right.
What's the matter?
I'm coming around to your side and help you push.
Maybe that'll do it.
Where are you going?
I'm going through your apartment.
Okay, now, let's both have at it.
All right, now level off.
There it goes oh.
Go that way.
It's stuck again.
Yeah, it's stuck on the edge of the sink.
Oh Look, I can get the door closed; that'll at least hide it.
Let's get your old furniture and put it back so Ricky won't suspect anything.
All right.
I'll help you push it out here.
Watch out for your hands.
Okay.
There.
There we are.
Now, where's the rest of your furniture?
Lucy?
Where's your old couch and coffee table?
They took it in the down payment for the new stuff.
You just going to leave this great big hole in the room?
Well, it's better than having a great big hole in my head.
That's what would happen if Ricky came home and saw all that new furniture.
Can I stick around and watch?
No.
Why don't you sell tickets?
This is going to be the best fight since Dempsey fought Willard.
I know what I'll do- I'll serve dinner out here.
That'll hide the fact that some of the furniture is missing.
How you going to get in and out of the kitchen?
Oh I won't- I'll have everything we need right out on the table before we start.
Oh, I haven't got much time.
Will you get the card table out of the closet?
And the tablecloth, too.
Oh!
Hi, honey!
Oh, hi, dear.
Did you have a nice day?
Yeah, wonderful, honey.
That's good.
Well!
Oh, I thought we'd eat in the living room tonight, dear.
You know, it's nice and cozy and comfy.
Sure, that's a wonderful idea.
What happened?
Something's missing.
It is?
The couch and the coffee table are gone!
Oh, so they are.
Well, where are they?
Gee, I don't know, they were here a minute ago.
I wonder where they went.
Here, couch, here, coffee table!
Here, coffee table!
Here, coffee table, here, coffee table!
Lucy What have you done with the couch and the coffee table?
I sold them.
I'd rather have nothing than look at that junk.
Uh-huh I can see through your little scheme.
I know what you've done.
You do?
You figured that if you sold the old stuff, I'm going to buy you some new furniture.
Well, now that you mention it, that was my little scheme.
It won't work.
Well, I'm glad I didn't spend too much time on it, then.
Well, let's talk about it after dinner, huh?
After dinner.
Yeah.
All right.
Oh.
You see, it's kind of nice having dinner in the living room for a change, don't you think?
I think so looks good, too.
Where's the butter?
Butter?
Yeah, butter.
What do you want to do with it?
I thought I'd put some on my bread.
Butter on bread?
Yeah.
I'll never get used to your strange Cuban dishes.
Okay, I'll get it myself.
Mmm!
Never mind, I'll get it.
Where are you going?
Uh uh, I'm all out of butter.
I'll have to borrow some from Ethel.
Butter.
Thanks a lot, Ethel.
Good old Ethel- I don't know what I'd do without her.
Well, thank you, honey.
That's all right.
Steak sure looks good.
Yeah.
Honey, these are the wrong kind of knives.
Can I have a steak knife?
Steak knife?
Yes.
Oh, here, I'll cut it for you.
No, thank you, Mother, just get me a steak knife, huh?
Oh, you don't need a steak knife.
Just pick it up in your fingers like this.
It's good for your teeth.
Nice and strong.
No?
I'll get a steak knife.
Now where are you going?
Well, we we we, uh Our steak knives are very dull.
I'll have to get Ethel's.
Steak knife.
Oh, thank you.
Salt cellar is empty.
Ooh!
Will you get me some, please?
Well, uh I, uh I loaned Ethel our salt.
I'll have to go get some.
I wish you'd told me sooner.
Now, Ricky Okay Let's have it.
I don't mean that.
You deliberately went out and bought that furniture after I told you not to.
No, I didn't.
I bought it before you told me not to.
And who did you think was going to pay for it?
Well, I was hoping that a certain handsome, generous, kind, generous, wonderful, generous husband whom we all know and love Lucy You going to take that stuff back to the furniture store tomorrow morning, do you understand?
Well, yes, sir, I understand, but I don't know that the store will.
I got it on sale.
Oh you got it on sale.
Yes, sir.
All right do you know what I'm going to do?
Yes Do you mind if I close my eyes?
I can't stand the sight of blood.
Never mind that.
As long as we have to keep that furniture, you are going to pay for it out of your allowance.
Oh, Ricky, that's wonderful!
Just a minute.
I'll pay the store for it.
and I'll pay you.
Right.
But I'm taking it to the club and putting it in my office.
When you save enough money, you can buy it back from me.
Oh, Ricky, that's $299.
I'll be an old lady before I save that much money.
Well, at least you know that you're going to have a nice sectional couch to rest on in your old age.
Well, that's true.
You can save it; you can save the money.
All you got to do is to learn how to economize.
You waste a lot of money out of your allowance every month.
You've got to learn the value of a dollar, Lucy.
You'll be surprised how soon you can save that much money.
But I want the furniture now.
The place looks awful without it.
Well, I can stand it; it doesn't bother me.
You'll get the furniture when I get my money.
All right, Ricky, I'll buy it back from you.
I'll economize- you wait and see.
Good.
Salt?
Thank you.
Morning, honey.
Oh, good morning, dear.
Breakfast is all ready.
Good, I'm starved.
What is this?
That's your orange juice.
We're economizing, dear.
We're cutting down on everything.
Oh, but don't worry, we have eggs and sausage coming up.
Well, they were in here someplace.
Oh, there you are!
See this?
This makes it seem like more- see, dear?
Lucy, now, you listen Oh, I forgot the toast.
Want some butter on it?
Lucy, I am not amused.
No?
No- when I told you to economize, I didn't mean by starving me to death.
You leave me the way I am.
Cut down on some of your "stravagances.
" What kind of "stravagances"?
You know what kind- like going to the beauty parlor and buying too many clothes.
And cleaning.
Yeah, cleaning- the dry cleaning bills in this place are ridiculous.
Well, you don't have to worry, dear; I thought about that.
I'm cleaning all of your dirty suits here at home.
My suits!
Yeah, I've already started- there's one in the sink.
Oh, no, you didn't.
You didn't put one of my good in the sink Yeah.
Oh, no, Lucy, it's ruined!
Look at this!
Don't worry, dear, I was practicing on one of your old suits.
Okay.
Just for being so smart, that is going to cost you another $100.
You now owe me $399.
Would you care to shoot for $400?
You can't charge me $100 for a stale old suit.
Can't I?
Aw, Ricky, please I'll be serious, I'll economize.
I won't buy any more clothes and I'll stop going to the beauty parlor- after Saturday night.
What do you mean, after Saturday night?
Well, the Carrolls are giving that big party at the club- you know.
I have to have a new dress and I'll get my farewell permanent.
No.
No?
Well, if I make my dress myself, can I get the permanent?
No.
No?
Well, if I give myself a permanent, can I buy the dress?
No.
Well, if I give myself the permanent and make the dress myself, will you go back to $299?
Yeah, that I'll do.
If you do that, that means that you mean business.
I only hope that you're serious.
Oh, I am, I am, Ricky, I'm serious.
Can't you tell by the way I look?
Hi, honey.
Hi.
How you doing?
Oh, fine, I've got my dress almost all cut out.
What are you cutting with?
A razor blade.
A razor blade!
Why don't you use scissors?
Well, I tried to, but they wouldn't cut.
Manicuring scissors.
Well, that's all I had.
Gee, I sure am impressed.
I never made a dress in my life.
Oh, there's nothing to it.
How's your home permanent coming?
Okay, I guess.
Oh, boy!
Hey, how about that?
I rented that sewing machine.
Isn't that a dilly?
You know how to run it?
Oh, sure, it's simple.
The booklet says even a child could operate it.
Let's see.
"First thread the bobbin.
" Do you have any idea what a bobbin looks like?
I'd better turn it on- maybe I can tell that way.
Oh that must be it- it's bobbin' up and down.
Hey, Lucy, look at this chart.
That's not the bobbin at all.
Ethel, will you go home?
Why?
I want to make this dress all by myself And I want to surprise you.
Oh, okay, I'll see you later.
Okay, come back in a couple of hours.
All right.
Lucy?
Just a minute, Mrs. Mertz!
I'm trying on my new dress!
Hurry up, I can hardly wait to see it.
What do you think?
I give up, what is it?
Pretty bad, isn't it?
I was hoping it would look different when I tried it on.
Well, it's different, all right.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
After all, I made it with my own two hands.
It looks like you made it with your own two feet.
If it weren't so true, I'd get mad at that.
How are you, Fred?
All right, thanks.
Hi!
Hi, Lucy.
Hi.
What's the matter with you?
Honey, what are you doing?
She's got on the dress she made.
Oh, come on, let us see it.
Yeah, come on out and let's see the new creation.
No.
Oh, come on, Lucy, you might as well.
Oh  Oh, honey come on, sweetheart.
Don't cry, honey.
It's tough making a dress, and this is your first try.
Well, I wanted it to be so nice so I could save money.
You saved money by giving yourself a home permanent.
Well, I don't My permanent!
I forgot all about it!
Oh, my goodness!
It's only supposed to be on 20 minutes.
How long has it been on?
Five hours!
That's the funniest dress I ever saw in my life.
Oh, now, you guys shouldn't have made fun of her.
She worked awful hard cutting that out.
Wasn't that something?
It looked like a sack of potatoes tied in the middle.
Oh, Fred, she tried real hard.
Oh, I can't Oh, we got to stop, it'd be awful No, no, now she can't come back out and find us all laughing.
Now, quiet down.
All right.
Oh, honey Well, Little Orphan Annie.
Oh, honey, what a shame.
It's all right, I've always wanted to look like a chrysanthemum.
Don't cry, sweetheart Don't cry.
There must be something you can do.
She can enter her head in the flower show.
Now, honey Lucy, you can go to the beauty parlor tomorrow and maybe they can fix it up.
I can't go to the beauty parlor- I can't afford it.
Yes, you can, honey.
I can?
Yes you can go to the beauty parlor, and you can buy yourself a new dress.
Oh, Ricky, really?
As a matter of fact, you look so sad I'll bring the couch and the coffee table back home.
Oh, honey, Oh, thank you!
Do you forgive me for everything?
Yes, sweetheart, everything.
Oh, the furniture and the dress and the suit and the rug?
Oh, that's wonderful.
Wait a minute- the rug?
Yeah remember you said you forgave me for everything.
I know, I forgive you for everything, that's all right, but what is this about the rug?
Well, when I cut out my dress, I guess I cut a little too deep.

{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
It's your lead, Lucy.
- I know it.
- Play it while you're still young.
You leave her alone.
This is important.
Oh, how did you know to lead hearts?
Ah, just a good guess!
That's mine, that's mine!
Down two, double and redouble.
That'll take a lot of figuring.
Oh, say, have you heard about Joanne?
No, what about her?
They're getting a separation.
Joanne and Greg?
Oh, honestly!
Is that true?
You're kidding, Caroline!
They decided they no longer had anything in common.
He claimed she was so wrapped up in the children, she didn't care about him.
If that's true, then it's her fault.
She claimed he came home and buried himself in the paper and didn't want her to have any part of his life.
If that's true, then it's his fault.
Aw, listen, it's both their fault, and it's nobody's fault.
It happens to every couple.
There's nothing you can do about it.
Why, Ethel Mertz, I'm ashamed to hear you talk like that.
That could never happen to Ricky and me.
Why, we just have everything in common.
Oh, come now, Lucy, every marriage reaches a point where the honeymoon's over.
Yeah, our honeymoon was over on our honeymoon.
I think you're all just terrible.
Ricky and I never get bored with each other.
He's interested in everything that I do and I'm interested in everything that he does.
and the honeymoon isn't over at all!
Well, it isn't!
Oh, come on, let's play cards.
Oh, hi, dear.
Oh, hi, honey.
How did things go at rehearsal today, dear?
Fine, just fine.
Uh I had a pretty interesting day today.
Don't you want to hear about it?
Uh-huh.
Well, I took little Ricky to the park this morning, and then this afternoon, Ethel and I had a bridge game and we won.
We won 25 cents.
That's twelve and a half cents apiece.
That's wonderful, dear.
What's that for?
Ricky Ricardo, you put down that paper.
We're going to talk.
Talk?
Yes- I say something, you say something, then I say something, then you say something and so on.
Well, I am aware of the way it goes, but why?
Because we're married, and I don't want you to come home and bury yourself in the paper like I didn't exist.
Oh, well, honey, that's a very good reason.
Okay.
Let's talk.
Well, that's better.
Uh How did rehearsal go today, dear?
Fine.
You told me that much before.
Well, that's all.
It went fine.
You know, nothing went wrong.
Everything was just fine.
Oh What kind of a day did you have?
Oh, fi real good.
Uh, this morning I took little Ricky to the park and this afternoon Ethel and I had a bridge game and we won.
Oh, I told you that much before, too, didn't I?
Yeah.
Uh You start this time.
Okay.
Um What will we talk about?
Anything- anything you're interested in, I'm interested in.
Okay.
Just pick a topic.
Um What do you think of the new tax law?
Pick another topic.
Well, aren't you interested in anything else, dear?
Right now I'm interested in reading my paper.
Oh, well, go ahead.
We'll both read it.
Okay.
There you are.
Thank you.
Why did you give me the society page?
I want the sports page.
The sports page?
Sure!
What do you think I am, a square?
I want to read the sports page.
Well, I'll read it to you.
Oh all right.
Who won the fight last night?
The fights Now, let's see.
Uh fight, fight, oh, here it is.
"Williams bags crown by Tko in eighth.
" "Tko"?
Yeah, Tko, t-k-o.
How else would you pronounce it?
That's how you pronounce it- t-k-o.
It means technical knockout.
Oh, of course, sure, sure.
Well, how long has this been going on?
What?
They're racing little girls at Churchill Downs!
What?
It says so right here- see?
"First race won by three-year-old maiden.
" Well, I wouldn't worry about that little girl if I were you.
She's as strong as a horse.
Well, she certainly was carrying a lot of money for a little girl.
She had $2,000 in her purse.
Thank you, Grantland Rice.
What?
Grantland Rice.
You surely heard of Grantland Rice?
Oh, sure, I've heard of it, but I've never tasted it.
Yeah.
Gee, isn't it fun reading the sports page together?
It's very enlightening.
I've been reading the sport pages for years, I never found any of that stuff in there before.
Well, you learn something every day.
Maybe you can move over there and we can read it at the same time.
Oh, sure.
I'd like that.
Sure.
Okay.
Isn't this fun, dear?
Mm-hmm.
We have a lot in common, don't we?
Mmm.
Oh, Ricky, it's so wonderful having you around this morning.
Didn't you like it?
I sure did, honey.
Oh, I sure did.
I wish you could do it more often.
Uh will you let go of my arm long enough to put my coat on?
Oh, sure.
Let me help you.
Thank you.
Remember now, honey if anything interesting happens to you down at the club, be sure to tell me because I'm interested in anything interesting that happens to you.
All right, honey, sure.
Hi, Rick.
Oh, hiya, Fred.
I'm glad I caught you.
What's up?
I just heard from my brother and he's got everything all set for our camping trip.
How's the last week in July for you?
Oh, that sounds just great.
Great.
He's got the guide and the pack train all set and he says the streams are so full of trout that they jump in your pocket.
Oh, boy!
I'll write and tell him okay, huh?
Oh, sure.
We wouldn't miss it for the world.
Honey  Oh, the baby.
Honey, I'll be right back.
Uh the camping trip is going to be just wonderful, Fred.
What camping trip?
Oh, now, come on, Fred.
No, no, no.
If Lucy's going, Ethel will want to go, and I could be miserable at home.
Look, Fred, I'll talk her out of it.
it's just that she's in a funny kind of mood.
She wants to do everything that I do.
I don't know what's the matter with her.
Yeah, Ethel told me about that.
Well, tell me, would you- what's cooking?
Well, Lucy's been trying to prove to the gals in the bridge club that you two are not bored with each other like other couples who've been married as long as you have.
Oh, that's it, huh?
Well, that explains the whole deal.
She's been sticking to me every minute.
It's like having a piece of gum stuck to your shoe, you know?
Well, you better try and scrape her off before it's time to go on the camping trip.
Don't worry, Fred, I'll talk her out of it.
I'll think of something.
Well, I hope so.
Well, let's see, there must be some way to do this.
Hey suppose I take her on a preview camping trip.
I don't quite get you.
Well, I could play up all the discomforts of camping- make her work her head off- you know, really rough it.
By the time I'm through, she won't want to go on another camping trip again.
You've really got something there.
Oh, gee, fellas, that camping just sounds wonderful- that camping trip.
I'll do all the cooking for us.
Listen, honey, just to get you an idea of what it's going to be like next summer, I thought that maybe you and I should go on a camping trip next weekend as a rehearsal.
Just the two of us, Ricky?
Ethel and I can take care of the baby.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, honey, that's wonderful!
I'd just love it.
Oh, honey!
Lucy?
I'll be right there!
Well, do I look like I stepped out of Field and Stream?
You look more like you fell in.
Well!
Never mind that.
I've got news for you.
What?
Do you know why Ricky's taking you on this little trip?
I certainly do.
Because we do everything together and because he can't stand being away from me.
Oh, no.
What do you mean, "Oh, no"?
He doesn't want you to go this summer, so he's going to take you on this little trip and make things so tough for you that you'll never want to go camping again as long as you live.
I don't believe that!
I can't help it.
I heard him talking when he came down to borrow Fred's sleeping bag.
He says he's sick and tired of you and him being the Bobbsey twins.
The Bobbsey Well, that big How do you like that.
Lucy, when you tell Ricky you're not going with him, don't mention that I What do you mean, I'm not going?
Well, are you?
I certainly am.
I'm going to beat him at his own little game.
What do you mean?
Well, of course, I'll need the help of a very loyal friend, one who will tell Fred that she's visiting her mother, but who in reality will be staying at a lodge nearby.
Oh, no, I won't!
Now, Ethel!
I'm not going to do it!
You haven't even heard my idea!
You thought it up- that's enough for me!
What kind of a friend are you?
Every time you get an idea, I get dragged in on it somehow.
Just answer me that- what kind of a friend are you?
I always end up I think it's right around here someplace.
Yeah, that's the spot right down there.
That's where the good fishing is.
My feet hurt.
Well, honey, I'm sorry, but you've got to hike for miles before you get to the good fishing spot.
Your feet will feel better when you're standing in the water.
Standing in the water?
You got to walk right out into the stream.
How are we going to catch these fish- by stepping on them?
Don't mind that- that's the way that you fish for trout.
Oh.
So you got to go right into the stream and stand in the water there, and you stand there for hours and hours.
Water is cold- freezing.
Maybe you want to call the whole thing off.
It's too much for you?
No, no Too much for me?
Pooh!
What's a little cold water?
Listen, Ricky, do you think this measly little basket is big enough for all the fish I'm going to catch?
Oh, well, I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.
No?
No, usually the first time that you come out, you don't catch anything, except maybe a cold or a mosquito bite, or frostbitten feet.
Oh.
Well, come on, let's go.
Listen, Ricky, let's not fish together.
Let's, uh, separate and see who catches the most.
Well, don't be silly, now, come on.
No, no, really, you know how fish are.
No, how are they?
Well, they're shy.
If there's too many people around, the fish just won't stay- they go.
Okay, we'll go downstreams a way and then we'll separate.
Well, I think I'll go upstreams a way.
Look, I've been here a hundred times and there's no good spot up there.
There's no fish up there.
Oh, I don't know.
It looks pretty fishy up there to me.
Okay, have it your own way.
I'll meet you back here in one hour.
Okay.
All right.
Watch out for bears!
Bears!
Ethel?
Ethel?
Oh!
I thought you were a bear.
Huh?
Did you get the fish?
One dozen of the best trout that they had at the fish market.
Good.
No, don't give them to me.
Throw them to me.
Throw them to you?
I want to be able to tell Ricky I caught them.
Oh.
Okay.
Ooh!
Oh, they're beauties.
How'd you get here?
I trailed you like an Indian.
That was some walk, wasn't it?
Not for me.
I borrowed a station wagon from the lodge.
I've trailed you all the way from your campsite.
It's parked back down the road.
Hey, that gives me an idea.
What?
Go back in the car and wait for me.
What are you going to do?
I'll tell you later.
Just go in the car and wait for me on the road.
Don't let anybody see you.
Okay.
Say "Ah.
"  Lucy?
Oh, there you are.
I don't blame you for quitting.
The fish are really not biting today.
Oh, haven't you caught any yet?
And how many did you caught?
Well, I didn't have very much luck.
That's what I thought.
Only these.
You catch all those?
Yes, sir.
I certainly did.
What did you use for bait?
Bait?
Yeah, didn't you put anything on the hook?
No, no.
I just threw the hook in and then when all the fish jumped on, I just pulled them out.
Ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay.
Well, we better get back to camp.
How do you feel?
Tired, huh?
Well, yeah, those fish put up quite a fight.
Well, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to keep a pretty good brisk pace back to camp, or we'll never make it back there by night.
Well, don't worry, I'll keep up with you.
I hope you're able to.
Able to?
I'll tell you what I'll do- I'll race you back to camp.
Race me back to camp?
Yeah.
You've been standing out in the heat too long.
Well, nevertheless I'll race you and I'll bet you five dollars that I'll beat you back.
Are you game?
Okay, I'll just take you up on that.
And because you're a woman, I'll give you a head start.
Well, because I'm a woman, I'll take it.
Hey, you keep up that pace, you won't last a mile.
Slow down!
Isn't this a beautiful night?
Yeah.
What time is it?
Eight o'clock.
Three hours, what do you think is keeping Ricky?
Give him time.
He didn't have me waiting in a station wagon to bring him back like you did.
Here he comes!
Hurry up!
Be sure and meet me right here in the morning.
Don't forget!
Keep out of sight!
What took you so long, dear?
Great day for a hike, wasn't it?
Nothing like a hike to tone up those old muscles, eh?
Ricky, say something.
Water!
Of course, dear.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I must have used it all up.
You see, I got back so early, I had time to wash my hair.
Look, honey, if you're so tired you'd better go to bed, huh.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
That a boy.
Remember, you promised to take me hunting at 5:00 in the morning.
Oh, no.
Okay, I'm all ready to go hunting.
All right.
I'll get the guns.
Okay.
Ethel?
Ethel?
Here I am.
Where?
Here.
Where?
Here.
Where?
Up here.
How did you get up there?
It wasn't easy.
Where have you got the horseshoe nailed up?
Over there on that tree.
Where?
Over there.
Way over there?
I can hardly see it.
Don't worry, you'll hit it every time.
Let's hear how it's going to sound.
Shh!
That's fine.
Remember now, I'm depending on you.
Yeah.
How about the ducks?
Everything's under control.
Okay.
Are you sure you want to go hunting?
Sure, I want to go.
Which gun is mine, that one?
Yeah.
You know how to use one of these things?
Do I know how to use one of these things.
You see that horseshoe over there?
Where?
Right over there.
Way over there?
Don't tell me you're going to hit that.
Watch this.
The trigger is the one behind there.
Oh oh, it's that kind of a gun, huh?
Yeah.
I don't believe it.
Now, with my eyes closed.
Over my shoulder.
Aha, you missed that time.
Well, anybody could miss  One of my slow ones.
What's going on around here?
Now, Ricky, look, That's enough target practice.
What's say we start hunting, huh?
I bet I get more ducks than you do.
Ducks?
Yeah, you know, birds flying over.
Well, there isn't one duck within 100 miles of here.
Oh, I don't know.
These look like pretty good duck trees to me.
This might come as a surprise to you, Lucy, but you find ducks on the water, not up in the trees.
Well, I'm sure I saw Oh, there they are!
There they are!
Watch it, watch it!
You know, that's pretty good shooting.
Not only did you kill the duck, but you knocked his feathers off and you cleaned it, too.
Yeah, well, that's enough duck hunting.
Let's do something else.
Now, wait a minute.
I think you're right.
I think there's a lot of ducks here.
No, no.
Oh, I think so.
I don't think there's any.
Look, there's a nice big fat one right over there.
Don't shoot, Ricky, it's me!
Ethel, you get out of that tree!
Okay.
What are you doing up in there?
I was just looking at the view.
Never mind that, get out of there!
Oh You come here!
Ethel, what's the matter with you, getting ducks that are all cleaned and plucked?
I didn't unwrap the package till I got up in the tree and then it was too late.
Oh!
So Ethel has been here all the time, huh?
Well, that explains a lot of things.
Does it explain why you brought me up here just to make me hate camping?
That has nothing Oh, you knew about that?
Yeah, I knew about that.
Oh.
Well, I guess this makes us even, huh?
Oh, all right, Ricky.
I'm sorry.
You know, I really don't want to share everything with you.
You dun't?
No, I "dun't.
" Just certain things.

Good morning, Lucy.
Oh, hi.
I brought up your mail.
Oh, thank you very much.
Oh!
Oh, Ethel, look!
Life, the magazine- the one with our pictures in it.
Is this the one with your pictures in it?
Yeah, well, let me have it now.
Well, I'll find 'em for you.
Honey, I can find it.
It's my magazine and my pictures are in it.
Okay.
Let's see now Oh, here it is.
"Life visits an orchestra leader at home"- page 43.
Oh, I'm so excited.
I wonder what my hair looks like.
Oh, you know, the beauty parlor did a whole new makeup on me that day.
Yeah, I know.
All right, all right.
Oh, and I had on a new dress.
Oh!
Oh, here it is.
Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, that's just great!
Look, Ricky practicing at the piano.
Oh, doesn't he look great?
Look at that expression.
Oh, here he is making arroz con pollo in the kitchen.
I've seen him like that a dozen times.
Doesn't that look natural?
Oh, look at the baby.
Oh, isn't he a little doll?
Yeah.
Oh, here's Ricky teaching Little Ricky to play the conga drum.
I didn't know they took one like that.
Isn't that wonderful?
That's awful cute.
Look at that big picture of Ricky.
Isn't that wonderful?
Oh, yeah.
That's all?
I must have missed something.
No, that's all.
Gee, three whole pages of pictures!
Well, so what happened to me?
There are no pictures of me there.
Oh, yes, there are.
I saw them.
You did not.
I did, too.
You were in this, uh Uh Yeah, there you are.
Where?
There- holding the baby.
Oh, great.
That's a fine picture of my left arm.
Oh, come now.
And after all the trouble I went through.
I told all my friends to look for pictures of me.
Now, Lucy.
If they don't recognize my left arm, I'm dead.
Oh, it isn't everybody who gets her arm in Life magazine.
Oh, I don't want my arm in there.
I want my face in there.
For heaven's sake.
If I'd known what they were up to, I'd have held the baby in my mouth.
Hey, 20 million people read this magazine.
Why, your arm will be famous.
Thanks.
Oh, don't be so unhappy.
Think of how much good it'll do Ricky's career.
Oh, sure, what about my career?
You don't have a career.
Exactly, and why?
Publicity like this.
Oh, now, Lucy.
It's a wonder I've got where I am.
Where are you?
Oh, shut up!
Who's that?
Hi, honey!
We made it!
We made it!
Look!
Look!
It's all over the place!
We're in Life magazine!
Yes, I saw us.
Oh, isn't that wonder?
How about that?
Oh, it's just wonderful, Ricky.
We got more pages than the two-headed alligator.
And the wonderful pictures of the baby?
Yeah, wonderful.
Oh, boy.
Look at the picture of me at the piano.
Isn't that good?
I got kind of a funny expression on my face, though.
Oh, I don't know.
It isn't as funny as the expression on my elbow.
Huh?
How did you like the pictures of me, dear?
Oh, beautiful, honey.
I thought you never looked better.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, we ought to be the happiest two people in the whole world.
Well, the happiest one and a quarter anyway.
What do you mean?
I hate to be the one to point this out, Ricky, but there's a certain loved one whose picture does not appear in there.
Who?
Me.
Oh, now, don't be silly, you're in here.
I am?
Sure Oh, that's right, you're not.
Oh, that's right, you're not.
Well, gee, I'm sorry.
You don't have to get mad at me.
It's not my fault.
It is, too.
How can it be my fault?
They would have printed my picture, but they didn't because I'm not famous, and the only reason I'm not famous is because you've never given me an opportunity to display my talents.
Oh, no.
Now, Ricky, you listen to me Now, you listen to me.
If you don't mind, I don't want to listen to either of you.
Now, no low blows and watch your kidney punches.
Go to your corners, and when the door slams, come out fighting.
And may the best man win.
Now, Ricky Now.
listen I don't want to go into a long discussion of why you should be in show business.
I will save you a lot of time and a lot of breath.
I will give you an answer right now: no.
But I want a career.
You have a career.
Being a mother is very important, you know.
I know that, and it's only because of Little Ricky that I want to get my break in show business.
Well, I know I'm going to be sorry I asked this, but how do you figure?
Well, you just think ahead a little bit.
When Little Ricky goes to school and some of his playmates asks who his parents are Yeah?
just what is he going to have to say?
"My father is Ricky Ricardo, "the internationally known entertainer, "and then there's my mother, whose name escapes me for the moment.
" Oh, the poor, poor child.
Yeah, well.
You see?
He heard me.
He's so humiliated he's crying already.
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.
Hiya, Fred.
Hey!
Aren't you the fella that I saw in Life's magazine today?
Gosh!
Could I get your autograph?
Oh, shut up, Fred.
What's the matter, Rick?
Gosh, I thought you'd be feeling great after all that publicity.
Well, do you happen to notice that they didn't put one of Lucy's pictures in the magazine?
So what?
The spread was about you.
Well, that's what she's mad about.
She said if I hadn't kept her out of show business, the spread would have been about both of us.
Oh, now, don't tell me: So she wants to get the act again, huh?
To put it mildly, yeah.
Well, it's all your own fault.
Not you, too.
Well, I've always felt that you handled the thing wrong, Rick.
Huh?
How much did Lucy pay you to come in here and say that?
Oh, now, don't get me wrong.
She's like a million other people that are trying to break into show business.
All they see is the glamour and the stardom.
So?
So, why don't you give her a job, and let her see how much good, hard work there is in it?
Hey you might got something there.
Yeah.
That's a wonderful idea.
Sure.
Yes, sir.
I think that's a good idea.
I will give her a job in the show.
Sure, give her a job- even if it's a job in the chorus.
Please, Fred, how dare you say that?
I'll make her a star.
Then she'll really find out what hard work is.
Mmm, Ricky, you can be a meanie when you want to be.
Listen, I'll tell you what.
Yeah?
Go over to your apartment and call me on the telephone, will you?
Okay.
Who am I supposed to be?
It doesn't matter.
Just ring and then I'll take it from there.
All right.
Okay?
All right.
Thank you, Fred.
You're welcome.
Hurry up.
I will.
Hello?
What do you mean, I need one more dancer?
Oh, I see.
Well, what do you want- a blond or a brunette?
Oh, a redhead.
I see.
A redhead.
Well, I don't know.
I think I'd rather have a brunette.
Well maybe you're right.
Maybe a redhead would be better.
Yeah.
Listen, how tall a dancer do you want?
A small one?
Oh, a tall one, huh?
Well, look, in comparison to my height, where should she come to?
Here or here?
I mean, I don't see exactly what you mean.
Oh, right about here.
Uh-huh.
Well, if I can think of anybody, I'll give you a ring.
All right, good-bye, Jerry.
Good-bye.
Look, Ricky- medium height, red hair and a dancing fool.
You couldn't possibly mean you for the dancing part in the show?
Ricky, please?
Please, baby doll, please?
Oh, no, no, honey.
That's completely out of the question.
Oh, but why?
Well well, I must admit that physically you are just right for it.
Uh No, no.
But you just said I was just right.
Yeah, I know, but, honey, it's a big part.
It's-It's a lot of dancing in it.
Very a lot of hard work.
You couldn't take it.
Oh, yes, I could.
I'll work day and night.
I know I could.
I'm ready, coach.
Send me in.
Well Okay, you talked me into it.
Oh, Ricky!
You're wonderful!
Oh, thank you, honey.
Okay, boys.
Lucy!
Are you ready to rehearse your number?
Yeah, I'm coming.
Ladies and gentlemen, our new star!
Oh!
Oh, I got a little crick in my muscle.
You know, I've been working awful hard.
She sure has, Ricky.
We've been rehearsing six hours a day for the last three days.
Well, good, good.
Oh, I liked it, though.
I liked every minute of it.
Well, that's fine, because I'd like to rehearse your number right now.
Do you know, do you know the number?
Well, I learned all the steps, but I haven't gone through the whole routine.
I see.
Well, it's what we call a challenge routine.
What?
A challenge routine.
You see, I do a step, and then when I finish, I go like this and that means you take it.
Then you do a step, and when you finish, you go like that, and that means that I take it.
Uh-huh.
And so on.
Oh, I've seen them do that.
Well, there's nothing to it.
Uh, yeah.
Okay, are you ready?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
All right, boys, we start the challenge routine off from the very top.
Come over here.
The entrance, you stand behind me, see, and you start with the right foot.
Yeah, I know.
All right?
Boys, are you ready?
One, two!
Listen, how come I'm doing all the dancing?
Well, honey, you are the star.
Oh, that's right.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm fine.
Well, that's good, you know.
We've got to learn this number today.
We've got about two more hours of rehearsal yet.
That's all right.
Go ahead, I'm ready.
All right.
Okay, on your feet now.
Let's go.
Here, here, I'll help you, honey.
Up you go.
Come on.
Up you go.
Oh Up she goes.
Oh!
Oop!
Now, here we go now.
Let's get up.
You all right?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Let's take it from the very top.
All right?
It's no use, boy, I can't do it.
I can't do it.
Here, honey, I'll help you up.
Up up you go now.
Up.
Now, you see, honey, I was afraid of this.
You see, all you were thinking was about the glamour and the stardom.
You never realized how much hard work goes into show business.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'm sorry I let you down.
I'd just like to go home and rest, thank you.
All right, honey.
Look, now, don't forget don't forget I gave you your big chance.
Oh, yes, honey.
You were wonderful.
I'm pooped.
Now, honey Honey, I I wish there was something else for you to do in the show, but there isn't, you know.
Oh, that's all right.
I understand.
Hey, Ricky, you still need a girl in that balcony during the Spanish scene.
What girl?
What balcony?
Honey, honey, honey, look, look, look What girl?
Honey, you wouldn't like it.
Look, all she does is just sit in the balcony and holds a rose in her teeth.
All she does is just sit there?
Yeah.
Can I do it, Ricky?
Oh, you wouldn't want to do that, honey.
Oh, yes, I would, yes, I would.
Really.
I told everybody I was going to be in the show, and I promise if you let me do it this time, I'll never ask you again.
Look, I'm a real good sitter, see?
You really promise?
I promise.
Okay.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Oh, hi, honey.
Hi.
What are you two doing here?
Hi, Luce.
Where's Mrs. Trumbull?
She had to go visit her sister so Fred and I are baby-sitting.
Oh, swell.
How is the baby?
He's fine.
He's still asleep.
Oh, that's good.
How's the rehearsal going?
Fine.
What's that for?
My part in the show.
See, I sit up on the balcony and hold a rose in my teeth and Ricky sings a number to me.
Is that all you do in the show?
Well, it's a very important part.
The whole number revolves around me.
I didn't think he'd have nerve enough to go through with it.
Go through with what?
Well, he was going to pretend to star you in a big dance number and then rehearse you so hard you'd get tired and quit.
What?
Well, don't get sore.
He didn't do it.
The heck he didn't!
And thanks for telling me.
Me and my big blabbermouth.
So, he let me do all that dancing and he had no intention of putting me in the show, huh?
But you said you were in the show.
Oh, sure, all I do is sit there and hold a rose.
I might as well be a vase.
But you said you had a big important part and you said you were doing all right.
What do you do, write down everything I say?
I'll get even with him, the bum!
Oh, Lucy do me a favor, will you?
Don't tell Ricky I told you.
Fred, I'll do you a favor on one condition: What's that, I'm afraid?
You will help me get even with him.
Uh-oh.
Listen, I remember you told me about a vaudeville act you used to have.
Now, there's a certain part of that act that I think I can use if you will enlighten me on a few facts.
Night in Madrid, blue and tender Spanish moon made silver splendor Music throbbing plaintive, sobbing notes Of a guitar While ardent caballeros serenade.
Lady of Spain, I adore you Right from the night I first saw you My heart has been yearning for you What else could any heart do?
Lady of Spain, I'm appealing Why should my lips be concealing All that my eyes are revealing?
Lady of Spain, I love you.
Paso doble, paso doble.
Lady of Spain, I'm appealing Why should my lips be concealing?
All that my eyes are revealing Lady of Spain, I love you.
Thank you.

Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz will be back next week at this same time.
This is the CBS television network.
{END OF EPISODE 30}{START OF EPISODE 31}
TV  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Here we are once again from the Rainbow Arena bringing you a 15-round bout for the championship.
It's a lovely evening, and we've had a wonderful turnout here at the largest stadium in the East.
We can see many celebrities.
The weather is fine, and a sell-out gate is expected.
Okay, sucker, who do you like, huh?
I like Murphy.
He'll murder this other guy.
Oh, my little pigeon.
You like Murphy, eh?
Okay, now, let me see he's, uh three-to-one underdog So I'll give you, um even money.
You think you're kidding but I'll take it.
What you do, you find a gold mine or something?
Throwing your money away like that?
Just put up or shut up, buster.
I'll put up, I'll put up.
How much would you like to bet, Mr. Rockefeller?
Make it easy on yourself.
All right, uh ten dollars?
What's the matter, you frightened?
Fifteen dollars?
How about $20?
Oh, you must know something.
I know Murphy.
He's trained for this fight and he'll run through these 15 rounds like it was nothing.
Okay, okay, you may have Murphy.
I got Murphy.
You got him, all right, don't worry.
And may the best man win.
SÃ­.
Now, come on, kid.
Get your left hand up, Murph.
Just pace yourself.
Move away from him.
You'll murder this guy.
Don't you worry about nothin'.
He can't hurt you now- remember that.
Just keep in there.
Keep your chin under your shoulder.
Throw the right, throw the right.
Can't you hear me?
Throw the right.
Now!
Well, that's the last one.
Good.
Honestly, I seem to have my hands in hot water all the time- baby's laundry, dishes three times a day.
Nope, not yet.
"Not yet" what?
Well, sooner or later I'm bound to develop webbed-foot hands.
Well, what will we do tonight?
Are you kidding?
The same thing we do every week at this time- sit and watch Ricky and Fred watching the fights on television.
Oh, yeah.
Gee, Ethel, remember when we used to go to the movies on Ricky's nights off?
"Movies"?
Yeah.
What's that?
Oh, you know, it's sort of like television except the screen is bigger and it's just one channel.
Oh yeah.
Hey, do you think we could talk the guys out of watching tonight?
Are you kidding?
Tonight's the big fight.
Every week's the big fight.
Well, tonight's the big big fight.
Everybody's talking about it.
Oh, who's fighting?
I don't know.
It's always the same- Rocky somebody versus Kid something-or-other.
I got to go down to the corner and get some ginger ale.
Well, he sure was in a hurry.
Oh, they only allow him one minute between rounds.
Yeah.
You know, he's got himself trained so he can do anything in less than a minute.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Well, Ethel, what will we do tonight?
Play cards?
Oh, I'm sick of cards.
Want to make some fudge?
Oh, I'm sick of fudge.
Well, we'll just have to sit here and listen to the homey sounds of catcalls and body blows.
Yep.
Say, you know, Fred's going to miss that next round.
Well, he didn't expect to go down to the corner and get back here in time for the  Ethel, you know what?
!
What?
I'm revolting.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
I mean, this is a revolution.
I am going to revolt.
I'm tired of playing second fiddle to a television set.
Ricky is my husband and he is going to spend the evening talking to me or else.
Fred, too!
Or else what?
Or else I am going to find my evening's entertainment elsewhere without him.
Come on.
Okay.
Ricky!
Fred!
Help!
Fire!
Murder!
That's very flattering.
Do you think they'd notice me if I went around and stood in front of the set?
Oh, boy you were saved by the bell that time.
He's only playing possum.
Wait till the next round and Murphy will murder him.
What "next round"?
He won't be able to come out for the next round.
That's only the second round.
Just have your dough ready after the 15th round is over.
I'll have my money ready Fred!
Ricky!
Oh, hi, honey.
What is it, Ethel?
Ethel and I have decided that you have married us and not a television set.
What do you mean?
You know what we mean.
We are sick and tired of sitting around for an hour and a half looking at each other while you look at the silly fights.
Oh, now, honey, you know we watch the fights every week at the same time.
Yeah.
Sorry, I'm standing right here.
So am I. Girls, don't be silly.
You know we watch the fights all the time.
We want to see the fights.
I made a little bet with Rick  Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
Get out!
My goodness!
Gee, I never heard Fred talk like that.
Wow!
You'd think they were fighting that fight themselves.
Well, what do you think we'd better do?
Just forget about it?
No, they've got to be made to understand how we feel about this from a safe distance, of course.
Now you're talking sense.
I know- we'll leave.
And never come back?
No, no, we'll go down to the corner and call up here.
What?
I'll disguise my voice and ask for me and then when Ricky goes to get me to come to the phone he'll find out I'm gone.
And then they'll look for you and they'll find out that you're gone.
Then they'll really start to worry about us.
Yeah, let's leave a note and tell them to drag the river for our bodies.
Oh, Ethel, come on.
Okay.
Good night, Ricky.
Good-bye, Fred.
Don't wait up for us.
We may be out quite late.
In fact, we may never come back.
Yeah, yeah.
Come on, come on.
Come on, kid.
Kid, go, kid.
Get away from him, Murph, get away!
"Get away from him"?
He'll have to leave town!
Come on, boy, come on.
Will you look at that?
Even the policemen.
What a night to rob a bank.
Yeah, go ahead and call the boys.
Yeah.
Have you got a dime?
I didn't even bring my purse.
Oh, here's one.
Hello?
: Hello, may I speak to Lucy, please?
Just a minute.
Lucy, it's for you!
Hey, hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh : Ethel, you know what happened?
Ethel Ethel!
Huh?
You know what just happened?
What?
He called me to the phone and went back to watch the fights.
Oh, fine, now they won't even know we're out of the house.
Well, come on, let's go home.
No.
I refuse to go home and be ignored.
How about going to the movies?
They won't even miss us.
Well, what's the difference?
At least we'll get to go to the movies.
Besides, after the movies are over they'll miss us plenty.
That's right.
I think I'll call Mrs. Trumbull and ask her to look in on little Ricky.
Even if he cried, you know they wouldn't even know the difference.
No.
Oh I haven't got a dime.
It's a nickel.
I'll have to get change for this.
Uh, pardon me.
Could I have change for this, please?
Pardon me, mister, could I have change for this, please?
I'd like to make a phone call.
We might as well be at home.
Well, if he's so busy I'll make the change myself.
Hey, officer.
What is it, Max?
Just caught this dame with her hand in the till.
Aha!
Aha, nothing.
I was just trying to make some change.
Oh, sure.
That's right- she tried to get your attention, but you were busy watching television.
It was a lucky thing I dropped in here tonight when I came off duty.
You must be the two babes who are pulling all that stick-up stuff in this neighborhood.
We are not.
How dare you?
We're no "stick-up babes.
" We'll see soon enough.
What are you going to do?
We're going to take you down to the station house, book you and fingerprint you.
Remember, Max I got ten bucks on Murphy.
Ow Oh look, a knockout!
A knockout?
!
Who Hey!
Come back here!
You see him?
No.
I think we gave him the slip coming up that alley.
What a mess.
Of all the things to have happen.
For heaven's sake.
Well, what do you think our dear husbands are doing?
Care to make any bets?
Oh, fine, we almost got arrested and put in jail and they didn't even know we were out of the house.
The only way we'll ever get their attention is to put on trunks and fight each other at the Garden.
Nah, wouldn't matter.
Oh, don't fight it, Lucy.
It's bigger than all four of us.
All we can hope is that the set breaks down.
Hey, that's an idea.
It is?
Yeah.
We could go up on the roof find the wire that connects with our television set and You mean go up there and cut the wire?
Yeah.
We don't even know which wire it is.
Oh Wouldn't it be easier to fight each other at the Garden?
No, come on.
TV  He throws a left and a left and another left and still another.
Now he crosses with a right Oh, gee, I forgot there were this many wires up here.
I wonder how we'll ever find out which one is ours.
It's going to be kind of hard to tell which one's which.
Well, guess I'll just have to cut them all.
No!
I'm only kidding.
We'll find the right one.
My gosh, a big building like this sure has a lot of wires running around it, doesn't it?
I'll say.
Oh, I think it's that one right there.
Which one?
That big one right over there.
Oh, no, that's connected to that building across the alley.
No, no, look where it comes from, see?
Look, that's it- that big one right there.
No, I don't think so, Lucy.
I think it's this little one.
No, I think it's this big one.
No, I think it's this little one.
I think it's the medium- sized one.
You do?
I don't know what  All right, you two, put up your hands.
Now, look, officer I was just going to cut this wire Yeah, I know how you work.
You cut the wire, the whole place goes dark and you clean out the entire building.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Listen, I happen to own this building.
Yes, and I'm J. Edgar Hoover.
Hold out your hands.
I'm not taking any chances on you two getting away this time.
Now, look, officer, I live in this building and I was just going to cut this wire so that our television set would go off so that our husbands wouldn't be able to watch the fight.
Yeah, it didn't have anything to do with the lights.
No.
Your wrists, please.
Now, look, I'll prove it.
This is the wire I was going to cut, isn't it?
Yeah.
And I'm still holding it, right?
Right.
Okay.
Ew Throw a left, will you, Murph?
!
Help!
We're being arrested!
Help!
Boy Hey did I just hear Lucy call me?
I don't think so.
Lucy, did you call me?
Lucy?
No.
I guess not.
How about that eighth round, huh?
This fight will never go the distance.
Oh, yeah?
Do you want to put your money where your mouth is?
You're darn right.
Come on, five bucks more?
Okay.
Officer, this is utterly ridiculous.
Quiet!
I'll do the talking.
Well, Sarge, I finally got hold of the two dames that are doing all that stick-up work on my beat.
Good work.
I'd know those two faces anywhere.
Pickpocket Pearl and Sticky Fingers Sal.
Really?
What'd you get them for?
Attempted robbery, resisting arrest escaping an officer prowling, possessing a deadly weapon and destruction of private property.
You'll probably get 20 years for this.
And I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't get a promotion.
Oh, thank you, Sarge.
Now, look, officer, I can explain.
You see I'll do the talking, Sticky Fingers.
I'm not Sticky Fingers.
Look, I know who you are.
Why don't you admit it?
Why, I've seen your faces on wanted posters a hundred times.
You have not!
I have, too.
I never forget a face, do I?
Never.
Yeah.
The only difference is you used to be a brunette, didn't you?
Dyed your hair.
A lot you know.
My hair is naturally red isn't it, Ethel?
Look, Lucy, let's not add perjury to our other charges.
Well, I might have expected something like that from you, Pickpocket Pearl.
Aha!
Oh, "aha" yourself.
I can clear this up in a minute.
Will you let me use your phone?
Don't touch it!
I wouldn't trust it in your hands.
What's your mouthpiece's number?
"Mouthpiece"!
My husband's number is Murray Hill He'll come down here and straighten you out in a minute.
Yeah, it's busy.
Busy?
!
Oh The phone must still be off the hook.
Well, now I'm going to ask you a few questions.
Pardon me, Sarge.
Do you need me anymore?
I'm off duty.
What's your hurry?
Well, I would like to see the end of that fight.
Oh, sure, go ahead.
Thank you, Sarge.
Wait!
What's the matter?
Where'd everybody go?
What are you trying to do- to be funny or something?
No, no, I was just thinking.
Officer, if you would go to my apartment- that's 3-B in the building where you arrested us- and tell our husbands that we're here.
Well They're looking at the fight- you can see it there.
Why not?
Okay.
Now, do you mind if I book you, Sticky Fingers?
I am not Sticky Fingers.
Now, I'll tell you who I am.
Have you ever heard of Ricky Ricardo?
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you, Mr. Ricardo.
I've heard you sing "Babalu" many times.
I am not Mr. Ricardo, I am his wife.
Have you got any identification to prove it?
Identification?
Well, I certainly didn't think I'd need my purse up on that roof.
Oh, no identification, huh?
Well, now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We can identify ourselves.
We can?
Sure.
Uh uh Well?
I'd like you to meet my friend, Ethel Mertz.
How do you do?
I'd like for you to meet my friend, Lucy Ricardo.
How do you do?
How do you Now, wait a minute!
That doesn't prove anything.
Well, it proves who we are.
Now, who are you?
Who am I?
!
Don't you know?
I'm Sergeant Nelson.
How do we know that?
Because I say so!
Well, that isn't enough.
Do you have any identification?
My word is my identification!
Well, then that's good enough for all three of us!
So it's settled: I'm Lucy Ricardo, this is Ethel Mertz and you're Sergeant Nelson.
How do you do?
How do you Now, cut that out!
Why should we believe you if you don't believe us?
I'll show you why.
I've got some posters here with your pictures on it.
You have not.
Oh, yes, I have, Sticky Fingers.
And don't call me Sticky Fingers!
That last round was a pip.
Oh, boy, two more rounds.
I don't see how either one of them is still standing up.
What a fight, what a fight.
TV  The blows that have been landed have been hard, fast and there have been literally hundreds of them.
He's down!
Three, four five, six Come on, kid.
He's up!
Come on, kid, give it to him, kid!
Come on!
iEn la panza, en la panza!
Come on, give it to him.
Stay away from him.
I can't find your picture here, but I've got a report on you.
Let's see Yeah, here it is.
"Sticky Fingers Sal and Pickpocket Pearl, "arrested June 9, 1952.
"Sentenced and committed May 12, Now serving ten years at the state prison farm.
" There, how about that?
: "Now serving ten years"?
!
I've been telling you that you were making a big mistake.
Now, look, my husband is Ricky Ricardo the orchestra leader.
And my husband is Her husband is Ricky Ricardo the orchestra leader.
Well If you want to prove it call that number again.
The policeman should be there by now.
For heaven's sake I never saw such a stubborn man in my life.
He just goes on and on and on  Give it to him.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Sarge.
Well?
It's like she said: The two of them are watching television.
Oh, no.
Is one of them Ricky Ricardo?
Yeah, that's him all right.
Ew hold on.
- I'm sorry, you can go.
- Oh, we can go?
Well, you haven't heard the last of this.
Jenkins, you idiot!
Now, wait a minute, Sarge, don't get excited.
I can get out without them ever knowing I've been here.
What?
I know it sounds crazy.
I'll explain it to you when I get down there.
I'll be right over.
Come on, come on, come on Oh, what an experience!
Oh Oh, dear.
An earthquake wouldn't drag them away from that set.
Say, how much do you think that cop told them?
Do you think they'll be mad at us?
Listen, if they are, our only chance is to be just as mad right back at them.
This whole thing wouldn't have happened if they hadn't been so wrapped up in their silly fight.
That's right.
Now, remember we're going to be mad at them.
They make me sick.

Never mind.
Come on, let's get a sandwich, will you?
You're a bum, Murphy!
Come on Ahh, here they are, Fred- the two most wonderful wives in the whole world.
Huh?
What a couple of dolls.
"Dolls"?
Certainly, who else has such wonderful wives?
You knew that we wanted to watch the fights so you stayed right here in the kitchen and didn't bother us once.

Lucy?
Yes, dear?
Where are you?
Right here.
Where'd you go?
I'm here, I'm looking for you.
Well, wait there, I'll come back.
No, no.
Stay where you are, I'll find you.
I know this jungle better than you do.
Dr. Livingstone, I presume.
What is all this?
The laundry.
I can't hang it outside today; looks like rain.
Well, can you hang it someplace else besides the kitchen?
Well, there's always the living room or the front hall.
Well, I guess it is a problem.
I'll say it is.
It's an awful problem.
But it's one that you could solve if you'd just say the word.
What word?
Automatic dryer.
That's two words, and I'd like to add one more.
What would you like to add?
No.
Oh, now, Ricky, if I had a dryer this wouldn't happen every time it rains.
And there's a lot of rain ahead.
I read about it just the other day in the almanac.
Look, honey, the answer is no.
Oh Dryers are too 'spensive.
They are not "spensive".
Not considering all the backbreaking work they save.
I know, honey, I know carrying this heavy basket.
Up and down, up and down my muscles straining, body all aching and racked with pain.
Fold those shirts, lift those sheets, up All right.
Now, look, Old Man River, will you dry up?
Well How about some breakfast, huh?
I haven't fixed it yet.
How come?
I can't find the stove.
I know it's around here someplace but I just haven't been able to find it.
All right, all right, all right.
I'll eat downtown.
How do I get out of here?
I won't tell you.
Ay, Dios mÃ­o.
Esta mujer estÃ¡ completamente loca.
No sÃ© lo que le pasa Hi, Lucy.
Hi.
Gee, it's taken this wash a long time to dry.
This is my third batch.
Oh, you poor little thing.
Babies sure make a lot of laundry.
I'll say.
I've been trying to talk Ricky into buying me an automatic dryer but he says they're too "spensive".
I'm surprised he doesn't want me to go down to the river and beat the clothes clean on a stone.
Well, at least you've got a good washing machine.
How'd you like to do your wash in that old relic of mine?
Honestly, I think it was the first one ever made.
Yeah.
Ethel, you know what?
What?
I want a dryer.
I don't care how much it costs-- we can buy it on time or something but I'm going to have a dryer.
Honey, I'm home.
Good, we can have this out right now.
Do you mind if I come with you?
Not at all, but why?
I want to watch your technique.
If it works, maybe I can use it to get a new washing machine out of Fred.
Be my guest.
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Hello, Ethel.
Hi, Ricky.
Ricky, I have something to say to you.
Well, honey, I got something to tell you.
Hold it, Buster, I'll do the talking here.
I want a new dryer, understand?
Now, I know they're expensive but we can buy it on time and pay a little bit each week.
Well, honey, I bought a new washer and dryer today.
You just don't realize what I go through.
Up and down those stairs 20 times a day.
Up and down, up and down down and up Lucy.
Poor little arms aching so that I can hardly lift them.
Back breaking, shoulders stooped, legs buckling New washer and dryer!
Ethel, did you hear that?
Yep, five minutes ago.
Oh, honey, you're wonderful.
Well, I got to thinking that it is pretty rough on you and I got a good deal.
Oh, honey, you're so thoughtful.
I love you.
Aren't they sweet?
Just like two lovebirds.
What are you, a bird watcher?
Fred, guess what?
Ricky's buying me a new automatic washer and dryer.
No kidding?
Yeah!
Well, it isn't as much as it sounds.
I got them wholesale and the fellow's allowing me $35 on our old washing machine.
Hey, wait a minute.
How'd you like to have a new washing machine?
Oh, Fred, do you really mean it?
Sure, I'll buy you the Ricardos' old one.
Old one?
You just said a new one.
Well, it'll be new to you.
Oh, fine.
All I ever get is hand-me-downs.
All right, if you don't want it, you don't Oh, no, no, I'll take it.
We can give our old one to the Smithsonian Institute.
Well, now, just a minute.
I-I-I don't think this whole thing is any good.
Why not?
Well, my father told me many years ago: "Nunca hagas negocios con amigos ni con parientes".
Your father said that?
Never mind.
It was good advice.
Well, will somebody please tell us what it means?
It means, "Never do business with friends or relatives".
Oh, honey, that's just silly.
It isn't silly.
Listen, people act in a very strange way when they're dealing with money.
Arguments about a business deal could mean the end of our friendship.
Oh, you certainly don't think much of our friendship.
Well, I do, too-- that's why I don't think it's a good idea.
Now, you let me sell it to the dealer and have him sell it to you.
Oh, that's fine.
You'll sell it to him for $35 and he'll charge me $75.
Yeah, Ricky, if you sell it to us you'll be saving us $40.
Yeah, the dealer might even charge them $100 and then you'd be saving them, uh $65.
Yeah.
And the dealer might even charge them $125 and then you'd be All right, all right.
Saving them probably All right, I get it, all right, all right.
As much as a hundred Ricky, you'll be doing me a favor.
I'll never get a new washing machine out of Secondhand Louie here.
Well, now, look.
Suppose that something goes wrong?
Oh, honey, what could go wrong?
We've had that machine for four years and nothing's ever gone wrong.
What if some little thing does go wrong?
I'm handy with tools, I could fix it.
Sure.
Oh, it can't affect our friendship.
Of course not.
Ethel, Fred you may have the machine.
For $35.
Oh, thanks, Ricky.
That's fine.
Great, I'll go and make out the check.
Oh, wait, wait, Fred.
Now, there's no hurry.
Okay.
Let's move the machine right now over to our apartment, huh?
Are you finished with it, Lucy?
They're delivering the new one in the morning.
Okay!
Come on, let's go and get it.
I'll help you, Fred.
Now, Ricky, Ricky, be careful, don't scratch it.
It might ruin our friendship.
All right.
: All through the summer Plants blooming all alone La-di-da-di-di-di-di-di La-di-da-da-di-di-di No rose la-da-da-da La-da-di-di-da-da-da Da-da-da-di La-di-da-da  Oh, it's you.
I thought there was something wrong with the washing machine.
Oh.
How about some lunch?
I'm fixing you a sandwich.
Good, I'm hungry.
Good.
La-di-di-da Hi.
Oh, hi, honey.
Oh, hi, Luce.
Come on in.
Come on.
Oh, have you got the little doll with you?
Yeah.
Oh, hello, honey.
Say "hi".
Look at that little champion.
Get the dukes up, Champ.
Look out, now, Fred.
He's stronger than you are, you know.
I just came up to see how my washing machine was doing.
You mean my washing machine.
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
Oh, Lucy, it's just wonderful.
It washes everything so fast I've run out of things to wash.
Really?
As a matter of fact I was just getting ready to ask Fred to go out someplace and get dirty.
Oh, hi.
Hi, Rick.
I thought I'd find you here.
Hi, honey.
I didn't expect you home so soon.
I'll go get your lunch, dear.
Oh, no, stay and eat with us.
Yeah.
Oh, no.
Oh, I got cold cuts and everything.
You sure you got enough?
Anybody from Albuquerque has always had enough to eat.
Oh, we've got everything.
Well, I love it.
Bologna, salami Put the baby right there.
Oh, just put everything in there.
Sit down here.
Oh, I love it.
What kind of meat, Ricky?
I wonder what that is.
Yeah, honey I always forget to get the butter.
Hey, it's the washer!
What's the matter with this thing?
What's the matter with it, Fred?
I don't know!
Pull the plug out!
The plug!
Pull the plug out, Fred!
Pull the plug!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, dear.
Gee, honey, this never happened before, did it?
Never, never.
Gee, Fred, that's too bad.
Yeah, this is really a mess.
It's a good thing we found out in time.
I'll say.
Yeah.
Found out in time for what?
I mean before the deal went through.
What do you mean, "before the deal went through"?
Yeah.
Well, I hope you don't think we're buying this piece of junk.
You already bought it!
I did not.
No money changed hands.
You took possession of the merchandise.
That's the same thing!
Yeah!
I told you we shouldn't have sold it to them.
You didn't.
Not much, I did.
You're going to pay me for this washing machine!
He is not.
He is too.
He is not.
He is too!
He is not!
I mean, I am not!
You're not going to unload this lemon on us.
Lemon?
Mira que tiene el coraje de decirle a uno ahora que no quieren comprar la mÃ¡quina de lavar.
Yeah.
Oh I can see it all now.
They knew this was a bum machine.
They knew it didn't have any trade-in value so they cagily planned to palm it off on us.
Palm it off!
You begged us to let you have it.
Begged!
Yeah, begged!
He says, "I'm a very handy man with tools.
If anything go wrong, I can fix it".
Entonces Ud.
SeÃ±ora dijo: "A mÃ­ no me importa nada".
"It won't harm our friendship a little bit".
No yeah-- some friendship!
That was before we knew you were cheating us.
Cheating!
?
Cheating!
?
There's been no cheating but there's been plenty of welching.
Welching?
!
Welching?
!
I'll thank you to haul this hunk of junk out of our kitchen!
It is immaterial to me, Mr. Mertz what you do with your old appliances after you ruin them.
Well said.
Thank you.
Come on, Lucy.
And I shall expect the check in the mailbox in the morning or I'll see my lawyer.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah!
Oh, no, you don't, Mrs. Mertz.
You put that machine in front of your own door.
I'd be very happy to, Mrs. Ricardo only that this happens to be your washing machine.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, you don't.
: Put it right over there where it belongs.
Oh!
MRS.
Mrs. Ricardo!
Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Ricardo!
Mrs. Ricardo!
I'm out here!
Oh, my, your front door was open, Mrs. Ricardo.
Well Good morning, Mrs. Mertz.
: Good morning.
What are you doing?
We're moving Mrs. Mertz's washing machine in front of her door.
: No we're moving Mrs. Ricardo's washing machine in front of her door.
Well, if you don't mind my saying so you're doing it the hard way.
What's the matter?
You seem to be angry with each other.
I'll tell you what's the matter.
Truce?
Truce.
I'll tell you exactly what happened.
Ricky bought me a new washing machine.
And the Mertzes insisted on buying our old one and then they got it over into their place.
They ruined it and they refuse to pay for it.
Oh, that isn't the way it happened at all.
As a favor to them, we allowed ourselves to be talked into buying this piece of junk and when we got it home, it fell apart.
What do you mean, it fell apart?
What do you mean, we talked you into it?
Oh, that's You practically begged.
Now, now, now, now!
Ladies, calm down.
You begged!
That's what you did, you begged!
You begged us to.
That's what you did, you begged!
Why, Mrs. Ricardo your temper is as hot as your red hair.
What about hers?
Oh, mine's as cold as your dark roots.
Well!
Well, now Now, now, listen, let's see a minute.
There ought to be some way to settle this in a friendly manner.
There there is.
They can pay us our friendly $35.
What?
Well, now, now wait just a minute.
I'll tell you.
I have a nephew who works in an appliance business.
I'll ask him to look at it.
Maybe he can fix it.
How about that?
Don't ask me, it isn't my machine.
She can do anything she wants to with her washing machine.
It is none of my business.
Oh, she makes me so darn mad.
Oh, you two.
Well, I just came up to tell you that I'll be able to baby-sit with little Ricky this afternoon.
Oh, well, thank you, Mrs. Trumbull.
I'm very happy that you can, because I How is it, Joe?
Anything serious?
Oh, I think we can pull her through, Aunt Matilda.
Oh.
But I think somebody's confused.
This is a washing machine.
They've been trying to use it as a garbage disposal.
Well that's strange.
How much will it cost to fix it?
Oh, seeing it's your friends about a dollar and a half.
Say, they wouldn't want to sell this, would they?
I don't know.
I'll give them 50 bucks for it.
Well, I'll tell them and let you know what they say.
I I better go look after the baby now.
So long, Joe.
Good-bye, Aunt Matilda.
Oh, are you the man fixing the machine?
Yeah, that's right.
It's a wreck, isn't it?
No, it's in pretty good shape.
It can be fixed up.
Oh, yeah?
Say, you don't know if they'd like to sell that machine, do you?
Sell it?
Yeah, whoever owns it, I'll give them 50 bucks for it.
Uh uh it, um it, uh It belongs to my husband and me but I don't know whether he'd want to sell it so cheap.
Have you spoken to the Ricardos?
Ricardos-- who are they?
You don oh Never mind, I'll call you.
Have you got a card?
Oh.
There you are.
Oh, thanks, well, I'll let you know if my husband decides to sell it.
It's such a good machine.
Yeah.
Okay, good-bye.
Good-bye.
Fred!
Fred!
Hi, Mrs. Trumbull.
Well, hello, Mrs. Trumbull.
How'd little Ricky behave?
Like an angel.
I gave him his bottle and he went right back to sleep.
That's good.
I wanted to talk to you about your washing machine.
Oh, you mean the Mertzes' washing machine.
Well, whoever it belongs to It belongs to the Mertzes.
Yes, that's right.
Well, my nephew says he'll pay $50 for it.
He'll pay $50 for our washing machine?
That's what he said.
Well, uh did did you speak to Ethel about it, uh?
No, no, I haven't told her yet.
Well well, don't bother, dear.
I'll tell her for you.
Thank you so much.
It's all right.
Let me know if they decide to sell it.
Oh, yes, yes, I will.
Thanks very much for coming down.
I hope little Ricky wasn't too much trouble.
Wasn't any trouble at all.
Thank you, Mrs. Trumbull.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Ricky!
Oh, my gosh!
I'm glad the Mertzes didn't buy it now.
: This is perfect.
We will go tell them that we will relieve them of their obligation.
Isn't this wonderful?
I can't believe it.
: Hi.
Well.
Lucy.
Ethel.
Hiya, Fred.
Nice to see you.
Come on in, sit down.
Oh, no, you sit down.
No, you sit down, Fred.
I'd rather No, I want you to be comfortable.
Sit down, Fred.
Thank you.
My, but it's good to see you.
Oh, it's good to see you, too.
You know, we've been talking over this silly washing machine situation.
Oh, so have we.
Isn't that a coincidence?
Well, we did act pretty terrible.
Yeah, we're ashamed of ourselves and we want to apologize.
Oh, it's not Ricky, here's your check.
Well, now look here, old man you really don't No, no, no, we couldn't take your check.
Well, why not?
Why, we just wouldn't expect you to pay for a washing machine that wasn't any good.
Oh, nonsense.
I'm a man of my word and a deal's a deal.
Here, Ricky.
No, no, no, no.
No, sir, no, no, no.
Not when I tried to palm off some faulty merchandise on you.
No, I couldn't.
No, we wouldn't let you pay for it.
To tell you the truth, we knew it would break down.
Why, we're practically swindlers.
That's right, yeah.
Oh, no.
We tried to welch on a perfectly legitimate deal.
Give him the money, Fred.
Yes, sir.
You've got to take the check.
Come on, now, Ricky you've got to take the money There you are.
Oh, no, you don't, Ricky.
No, no.
No, no.
Now, Ethel, you just take this check.
Oh, no, you don't.
No, no Now, look, Fred, I don't want it.
Oh!
Come on, Ethel let's get our washing machine!
Okay.
Now, there's your check.
Now, look, Fred, I don't want it!
Fred, I won't sell it to you!
Hurry up.
Fred Fred!
Ricky, let go of our washing machine.
Oh, no.
Let go of it!
Fred, I won't want you to get stuck with it.
I want to get stuck!
You don't want it.
Lucy, would you kindly take your hands off of my washing machine?
Why should I take my hands off your washing machine when it belongs to us?
Look what happened to your washing machine.
Our washing machine?
Certainly.
You said it was your washing machine.
You said you were ashamed  Pardon me, I was up here this afternoon looking at a washing machine.
I offered 50 bucks for it.
I spoke to you.
Yeah, I know.
Well, I got a buyer for it.
He'll go as high as $75.
Seventy-five?
Oh, no!
They'd pay seventy For that thing!
Oh, no, I don't believe it.
What's the matter What's the matter with you people?
Are you all nuts or something?
Oh, my.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Fred.
I'll split the cost of the rail with you.
Okay, and I'll give you $17.50 for half of that washing machine.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Here's your check.
You see, I knew nothing could ever affect our friendship.
