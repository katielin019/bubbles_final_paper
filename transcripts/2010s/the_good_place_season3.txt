{START OF EPISODE 1}
1 I still believe that they would have become good people if they'd just gotten a push in the right direction.
- Oh, no!
- What are they talking about?
- No idea.
- It's only four people, and it's clearly the best way to see if bad people can become good without knowing anything about what's waiting for them in the afterlife.
- Okay, let's do it.
- Yes!
But there have to be strict rules.
Otherwise, the results will be tainted, and I reserve the right to change my mind at any point.
Would someone who's not an eternal being please explain to me what the f  Hi, I'm Michael.
You must be The Doorman.
Ah.
This is wild.
I had no idea this was even here.
So I have this ruling from The Judge.
Heading on down to Earth to reverse the deaths of these four people.
It's kind of tricky, you know?
It starts up a new timeline, so there might be some ripple effects.
But it's necessary for the experiment that we're doing there.
So, how long's this trip take?
Hope I don't get a middle seat.
Wow, I haven't heard a joke in 8,000 years.
And I still haven't.
That's the door to Earth.
You go through there, you'll be wherever you need to be.
You won't have any other powers, though.
You want to get around, you're just going to have to - take a bus or something.
- A bus?
Oh, boy, oh, man!
I'm going to sit in a front-facing seat.
Or or no, maybe a sideways-facing seat.
I'm I'm going to get so motion sick!
Oh, man!
What do I do, just grab that key here Whoa, whoa, whoa!
This key is made of the very first atoms that came into existence in the universe.
It is one of a kind and cannot be duplicated.
See?
"Do Not Duplicate".
Only I touch this key.
Oh, and what's the significance of the keychain?
Nothing, I just like frogs.
I'm a frog guy.
When you need to get back here, make sure you're alone.
Press this button.
Any questions?
No?
Great.
Knock yourself out.
Uh-oh.
I-I'm sorry, but this is an important moment - On your right, mate!
- Oh, jeez, watch it, man!
Come down!
Come down where you belong.
Buongiorno.
Buongiorno.
Oh, wow!
I was just on Earth.
It was incredible.
The the traffic, the pigeons.
And I saw this place that was, at once, a Pizza Hut and a Taco Bell!
I mean, oh!
The mind reels.
A Pizza Hut and a Taco Bell!
Ah!
Oh, Janet, it was everything I ever imagined.
I got to ride a bike.
I put a coin in a thing and got a gumball.
And then someone came up to me and said, "Hot enough for ya"?
And you know what I said?
I said, "Tell me about it".
Well, I am glad that you got to chew a gumball.
Oh, damn.
I didn't even think to chew it.
Missed opportunity, shoot.
Did you also save their lives?
Yes, of course.
Everyone is safe.
Including Jason.
Now we just sit back and watch as they become better people.
Being good is for suckers.
What do you even get out of it?
I quit.
Eat my farts, Benedict Cumberbatch.
Morning, Chidi.
Blueberry muffin for ya?
Uh, I don't know, maybe.
I can't decide.
- You all right there, mate?
- Okay, I've made my decision.
I want to start crying.
Hey, Tahani Al-Jamil.
I'm from "International Sophisticate Magazine".
Mind if we ask you 582 questions?
- Sounds delightful.
- Where are we, exactly?
My pied-a-terre, just off the coast of "Barthelona".
What's one thing people don't know about you?
That I was such a tomboy in high school.
- See?
- Wow!
Looking good.
Okay, next question.
Who would you say is the most famous person in your phone?
It's not about who you know.
Enlightenment comes from within.
The Dalai Lama texted me that.
K, will you make me the happiest man in the world, and agree to be my wife?
No.
Do you think my name is the letter K?
Just say yes.
If we're married, legally you can't arrest me.
Plus, bonus you get half the stuff I stole.
Yep, he just confessed to the robbery.
Damn it.
You realize what the problem is, right?
Yes, but there's no way to help.
Maybe there is.
In the afterlife, they all got better because they helped each other.
And the key to that was Chidi and Eleanor's connection.
If I get the two of them together, - everything else will follow.
- Michael, no.
I'm going to meet Eleanor someplace and plant the idea in her mind that she needs to find Chidi.
Oh, and then maybe I'll visit Chidi and make sure that he helps her when she shows up.
I'm just going to nudge the two of them together.
Just nudge-y nudge nudge.
The Judge was pretty clear in her instructions, and The Judge is, you know, The Judge of, you know, the universe.
She'll never find out.
She spends all her time in her chambers bingeing TV shows.
She's watching all of "NCIS" right now.
Hey, there.
Need to head on back to Earth.
Travel papers.
Yeah.
You know, The Judge said to use the same ones.
Because I'm, uh, you know, visiting the same people.
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
I brought you a nice hot cup of antimatter.
I usually only drink decaf antimatter.
- Ah.
- Eh, I'll take it.
It's only 4:30.
My shift doesn't end until 9 billion.
Ooh.
- What do I owe ya?
- The real question, Eleanor, is what do we owe to each other?
What do we owe to each other?
That is the question Tim Scanlon asked decades ago, and it is the question I will try to answer over the next three hours.
Are you Chidi Anna Kendrick?
Anagonye, and yes.
Great, hi.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
- Can we talk?
- Sure.
Okay, uh, where do I start?
I'm not, like, the best person in the world.
I'm a trash bag from Arizona, which is saying something.
Our biggest exports are racist sheriffs and HPV.
But about a year ago, something crazy happened  And I  Sorry.
I've been flying for like, 40 hours.
This is Australia, right?
Yes.
I grew up in Senegal, so my native language is French.
But I went to American schools, so I also speak English.
- Oh.
- And German and Greek.
And Latin, just in case it ever comes back.
Cool.
I once got 12 out of 12 on a Buzzfeed quiz called "Do you know all the slang words the Kardashians invented"?
- Congratulations?
- Thank you.
I'm going to be honest.
I did cheat.
But you were saying something crazy happened to you?
Yes, uh, I almost died.
And it made me want to become a better person, which I did for a while.
But then I fell back into my old trash bag ways.
Yesterday, I saw your lecture, and something just clicked.
Wait, you flew all the way here from Arizona just to see me?
You know what, don't flatter yourself, pal.
Sorry, that's a knee-jerk reaction.
Yes, that's exactly what I did.
And I know that seems zonk-atronic that's Khloe's word for crazy but I need someone to help guide me, morally speaking.
And I think I need it to be you.
What do you say?
Will you help me become a good person?
- Yes.
-   I'll start you off with some introductory philosophy books, and then we'll meet here once a week.
Great.
Ideally, some of those books will have been made into a movie or maybe a funny GIF.
But anything's good with me, man.
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.
Why are you helping me?
I'm a teacher.
That's my job.
Yeah, but I'm not your student.
I'm just some hot rando who walked in off the street.
There's got to be another reason.
Yes, there is.
Um I also had a near-death experience.
- Whoa.
- Well, I mean, I don't know for sure that I would have died, but, it was pretty nuts.
I'm sorry, but this is an important moment in our friendship - On your right, mate!
- Oh, jeez.
Watch it, man!
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
That that is right where I was standing.
I was frozen here, unable to make a single decision, and I almost got crushed by an air conditioner.
This is a sign.
I shouldn't be using air conditioners.
The freon is awful for the environment.
That's the lesson you take from this?
Chidi, your brain is broken.
You need to fix your brain.
So in a nutshell, I have a 3,600-page thesis that I am nowhere near finishing, I am absolutely paralyzed by decision-making, and it is destroying my life.
Yeah, I sort of got that when you couldn't choose a chair to sit on.
Well, I didn't want to offend you in case you had a favorite.
Look, I know I just kind of nope walked in here, and you don't know me at all, but is there any way to tell if my indecision is due to a brain thing?
Um, yeah, sure.
Now what we do is we make a lengthy incision from your eyebrows to the nape of your neck, and we peel your face back, right, then slice your skull open.
And I just randomly stab at your brain with an electrified needle.
The fun part is you're awake the whole time.
Uh I'm kidding!
I'll just give you an MRI and look at the part of your brain that controls decision-making.
Oh, I want that.
I need to learn about my brain, please.
Well, so you just march into my office unannounced, tell me your brain is broken, then demand I drop everything and just put you in the university's $3 million MRI machine?
Oh, I'm sorry, I just I freaking love it.
You're so weird!
Let's go.
- Right now?
- Oh, yeah, come on.
Oh okay.
This is your hippocampus.
It regulates memory.
Yours looks great, very strong.
Gorgeous hippocampus here!
This is your ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the center of decision-making.
This is where the magic happens.
Do you see how it's all lit up?
That's a flurry of activity that occurred when I asked you to choose between red and blue, and you almost passed out.
Is it too late to pick blue instead?
It is, yeah.
The point is, at first glance, your brain is very healthy.
Huh, there are actual answers here, data you can observe and learn from.
Yeah, man, science is all about getting answers.
You philosophers can spend your entire life mulling over a single questions.
That's why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
-  - No offense.
Oh, none taken.
We suck.
- Yeah.
-   - Chidi.
- One blueberry muffin, please.
Why choose to be good every day?
I argue that we choose to be good because of our bonds with other people.
Simply put, we are not in this alone.
Thank you.
Wow, Chidi.
You chose that muffin in less than a minute.
That beats your old record by 59 minutes.
Henry, I feel amazing.
I am 100 pages into my new thesis, and it is some of the best writing that I have ever done.
I haven't been this happy since Oh, wow.
I've never been happy.
- Ha!
- Bad!
I'm proud of you, mate.
It must be really nice to live that way.
Well, that's the beauty of it.
Anyone can live this way.
Just decide to be more decisive.
Like, what's something that you've always wanted to do?
I mean, I have been putting off getting in shape.
Then make the decision to wake up tomorrow morning and get in shape.
It is that easy.
Okay.
Maybe I will!
- What have you got to lose?
- Nothing!
Henry, what happened to you?
Well, I was using the leg press at the gym, and you know how your legs bend a certain way?
My legs bend the other way now.
Oh, no.
All the tendons in my legs snapped like violin strings, and then, my foot flew forwards, and I kicked myself in the face, which gave me a concussion.
But on the bright side, I lost control of my bladder.
Someone got it on video, and now "Leg Press Whizzer" has 62,000 views on Youtube.
- I'm famous.
- This is all my fault.
I did this to you.
Oh oh, muffins!
I brought blueberry muffins.
Oh, no, you shouldn't eat blueberries anymore.
Read an article.
The migrant workers who pick them are horribly mistreated.
Yaaaaaaah!
Good morning, Chidi.
Blueberry muffin for ya?
Uh, I don't know, maybe.
I can't decide.
- You all right there, mate?
- Okay, I've made my decision.
I want to start crying.
Excuse me?
What is the maximum number of books that I can check out?
- Is it 12,000?
- Got a wild weekend planned?
Well, I need to find a new topic for my thesis, and I had this thing happen that made me more decisive, and a few months ago, my friend broke both of his legs, and it's my fault, and blueberries, and I need help.
- Whoo!
- Maybe that help will come from Tay Zonday's autobiography, "Chocolate Book".
I mean, who's to say?
Mate, I've worked in this library a long time, and I've seen a lot of academic types with that same helpless look on their faces.
They all made it through okay.
- Once they learned the secret.
- What's the secret?
There's a secret?
Is the secret more books?
- How many more books do I need?
- It's not about books, mate.
It's about perspective.
Sometimes, when you're feeling helpless, the secret is to help someone else.
Get out of your own head.
Trust me.
The next time someone asks for help, say yes.
A few hours later, you walked in and asked for help.
Now, I don't know if this is going to solve all of my problems, but it's worth a try, right?
Well, thank you, sexy librarian guy.
I didn't say he was sexy.
Oh, I know, but whenever anyone tells me a story about their life, I always imagine all the people as being super hot.
Otherwise, I quickly lose interest.
Do you not do that?
You can do it for free.
I got to say, I enjoyed playing the role of mysterious librarian, and I really  nailed the Australian accent.
- Uh-huh, flawless.
- Thank you.
But the point is, Eleanor and Chidi are together, and now we can relax.
Everything is finally on track.
- Status report.
- They're plugging away, but we still can't hack into The Judge's system.
Damn it, those four humans have been on Earth for over a year.
I need to know if they're getting better.
Can I just ask?
We torture, like, 30 billion humans.
Why do you care so much about these four?
Never mind.
Forget I asked.
Serves him right for questioning you, boss.
I think you're doing a great job.
Thank you, Todd.
- No, no, no, no - Why did you do that?
I'm a demon.
It's fun.
No one leaves this room until we've accessed The Judge's system.
Would music help?
Should I play some music?
Good idea.
Choose something deeply terrible to inspire us.
Wherever you go Oh, yeah.
That's the stuff.
So for Aristotle, virtue is practical.
Goodness isn't something that a person just inherently has.
It's something that she achieves through her actions.
- Questions?
- Uh, yeah, a few.
I wrote down "what"?
"huh"?
And then this doodle of a burrito because when I first read Aristotle, I thought it was pronounced like Chipotle.
Wait a minute, is it "Chip-o-tottle"?
These are all great questions.
But I have to meet my thesis adviser across campus.
Oh, well, I'm headed that way, too.
I'll walk with you.
Hey, so, I've been trying to figure out how to pay you back for helping me.
I told you, you don't owe me anything.
At home, when I want to get something nice for one of my friends, it usually comes in the form of something edible.
You get what I'm saying?
An "edible" thing?
- Please don't buy me drugs.
- Okay, copy that.
I had no choice, I was in his driveway taking pictures when he walked out, so I said "Hey, Mr. Crowe, I'm from the gas company".
- "I loved you in 'Gladiator.
'" - Chidi, hey!
- Hey!
- I got a question.
Is it "What's my thesis topic"?
- Because I still don't know.
- No, it's not that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You guys haven't met yet.
- Um, Simone, this is Eleanor.
- The famous Simone.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
So I've got to do some MRI scans as a control for an experiment.
And since you loved it so much last time, I was wondering if you could just pop back in there and help me out?
- Oh, absolutely.
- Cool, okay.
Well, just come by my lab at 6:00 and then afterwards, I can buy you dinner as a thank you.
Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that.
Oh, okay.
Well, uh, I'll see you later.
Nice to meet you.
- You, too.
- Yeah.
- What?
- Uh, you and Simone had some real professor dork vibes flowing.
You're both teachers who are hot for teacher.
How have you not asked her out yet?
- Are you scared?
- Well, it's not impressive to guess that I'm scared, Eleanor.
I'm scared of everything, and I can't just do things like that.
- Just drop it, okay?
- Well Okay, just promise me you'll drop it.
Okay.
I promise.
So you're into Chidi, right?
I mean, forgive my bluntness, but I'm usually right about these things.
Well, yeah, but I made it pretty clear a bunch of times, and he's never responded, so I just assumed he wasn't interested.
Okay, I'm all set.
I'm just going to ask you some basic questions, Chidi.
- What is one plus one?
- Two.
- What color is the sky?
- Blue.
What color are Simone's eyes?
Brown.
Uh uh, what?
If you could take Simone anywhere on a date, where would you take her?
Sorry, is this part of the experiment?
It is now, yes.
Please answer the question.
And keep in mind, we can see your brain.
Next question.
You are into Simone.
- That's not a question.
- So you agree it's a fact.
Next question's for Simone.
Simone, are you annoyed at Chidi for waiting so long to ask you out?
- Yes, I am.
- Chidi, same question for you.
Are you annoyed at yourself for waiting so long to ask out Simone?
I mean, I'm annoyed with you, and I've only known you three weeks.
Yes, I am obviously very annoyed with myself.
Can I get out now?
No, you can't.
It'll ruin the science.
There's only one question left, and you got to ask it, bud.
Simone, would you like to have dinner with me?
Wow, that is highly inappropriate.
- Uh - I'm just kidding.
Yes, I would.
Thank you for asking.
- Aw, cute.
- This is a disaster.
Michael, relax.
How are the two of them going to bond?
There were plenty of reboots where Eleanor and Chidi weren't even soul mates, and he still always helped her.
Simone and Chidi are good together.
I've been running simulations on what their kids will be like.
One of them is hot enough to be on "The Bachelor" and smart enough to never go on "The Bachelor".
This is not just about Chidi.
I've left too much to chance.
Until our group is back together again, this whole thing is hanging by a thread.
I'm going back down.
You're pressing your luck.
If you keep disobeying Mommy, something bad is going to happen.
- What?
- Oh, I don't have a mom, so I've been experimenting with thinking of The Judge as my mom.
- It's weird, forget it.
- Okay.
How are you even going to get Jason and Tahani to Australia?
I have no idea, but I have to try.
Well, good luck, Dad.
Nope, also weird.
Just go.
Hey, bud.
Brought you some decaf hazelnut antimatter.
Just a little treat for my old pal, The Doorman.
Heading back down, by the way.
You sure The Judge is okay with you going back to Earth so many times?
Oh, yeah, yeah, all good.
See, still got the papers.
Shouldn't be long.
How are we doing, Steve?
I'm trying.
I'm getting close.
Good.
No pressure.
-  - Aha!
Someone just went down to Earth, and that gave me a back door into The Judge's system.
Now we can see everything that's happening with all four humans.
- Excellent work, Steve.
-  Uh-oh, looks like someone's been cocooning again.
You know, it would be a real help if you let me know the next time you were about to  Well, well, well.
Looks like Michael's been caught with his hand in the human jar.
- Good one, boss.
- Shut up, Glenn.
Morning, teach.
Ready to discuss philosophy.
Obviously, I'm kidding.
How was your date with Simone?
Spill it, sweetheart.
We had a great time.
Thank you again for bullying me into asking her out.
Well, I owed it to you.
And bonus, I realized I was practicing virtue ethics by helping the two of you bone down.
Okay, not appropriate.
Also, not a great understanding of virtue ethics.
Oh, we can agree to disagree.
But if you must know, it was very chaste.
We didn't even kiss.
- Because you chickened out?
- I did!
Yeah, I totally chickened out, and I am so mad at myself.
Well, hey, maybe it wasn't the right moment.
Knowing the two of you nerds, your first kiss is going to be while reading Plato in an MRI machine.
Oh, hang on.
Come with me.
Simone, what's the one thing Eleanor and I have in common?
You both have a complete disregard for my office hours.
- Sorry, Reginald.
- Oh, no worries.
Look, listen, Eleanor is an Arizona trash bag.
- Yep.
- Her words, not mine.
- Totally.
- Who once told me that her greatest accomplishment was breaking into Charles Barkley's house.
Mm.
He was on the road.
I snuck in through the doggy door.
Tried on all his giant shoes.
One of my top five Christmases.
Listen, the point is, Eleanor and I have nothing in common except that we both almost died, and it made us want to be better people.
This is my thesis idea.
I will explore the effect of near-death experiences on ethical decision-making.
I will get a group of people together who have had near-death experiences, ask them ethical questions, and see if there's any commonalities!
That's great!
Why are you yelling it at me?
Because I need your help!
You and your magic brain scan machine.
Oh, of course!
A joint study with the neuroscience department.
We can use MRI mapping to see if a near-death experience alters brain function.
There's something there, right?
Definitely, I love this.
Great.
Also, I wanted to kiss you last night, but I chickened out, so I'm going to kiss you now.
Good, yes.
I want that, please.
Oh, sorry, Reginald.
What were you saying?
Um, that I can't come to class tomorrow - 'cause my grandma died.
- Oof.
Real mood ruiner.
Read the room, dude.
Bingo.
Okay.
Oh, good, you're here.
Eleanor, meet the newest member of our ethical neuro-scientific study, Tahani Al-Jamil.
Hello, Eleanor.
Delighted to meet you.
Al-Jamil.
Oh, you're Kamilah's sister.
I am, yes.
If you want an autograph or something, I can probably arrange it.
Eh, I was never really that into her no offense.
Oh,  I assure you, there is none taken.
So how did you come to join our team?
Well, it's a bit of a story, I suppose.
It, uh, began about a year ago.
Come down!
Come down where you belong.
Aah!
- Well done, Tahani.
- Who saved me?
Did anyone see who just saved my life?
- It was Kamilah!
- No, it was a man, I think.
- It was Kamilah!
- It was Kamilah!
No, it wasn't Kamilah!
It was someone over there.
Kamilah, Kamilah, Kamilah, Kamilah, Kamilah!
I had almost died.
And in that very moment, I decided to change my life.
First, I cleansed myself of all the worldly possessions that had been weighing me down like anchors the dresses, the jewels.
I gave them all to Good Will.
That's what I call Prince William.
Since he'd married a commoner, I assumed he'd know some needy people they could go to.
Sure.
Then I deleted all my celebrity contacts from my mobile.
Good-bye, Bono.
Good-bye, The Edge.
Good-bye, The Edge's real phone number that even Bono doesn't have.
And most importantly, I put physical distance between me and my old life.
Book me a flight to Tibet.
I'm going to live in a Buddhist monastery.
I need to get out of the spotlight.
Copy that, I'll see what jets are available.
- No, I'm flying commercial.
- Okay.
- First class, I assume?
- No.
I'm a woman of the people now.
Comfort Plus.
And there, in that humble monastery, thousands of miles from the meaningless concerns of high society, I embarked upon a quest for enlightenment.
I learned to embrace a life of simplicity.
I meditated.
I worked.
I gave back to Mother Earth.
And I slept.
My soul had never felt so nourished, until one day, my former life came knocking at the open space where a door would have been if we were given any privacy.
Yo, is that Tahani Al-Jamil?
Man, it totes is you!
What up?
I'm Colby, "Squalor News".
What are you doing in this monastery?
Oh, we're doing a new show about poverty, drug lords, gun running, weird-ass restaurants, skateboarding, oh, and also genocide.
It's called "Society is F'ed".
What are you doing here, though?
Is this where you came after your sister saved your life?
I am living here as a way to shed my desire for attention.
Toigh, that's what's up!
You got to shed that, right?
But listen, if you ever want us to do like a monster profile on you and your monk junk, we would be honored AF.
I think people would be supes interested in what you're doing here, for real.
Look, here's my card.
Think about it.
Of course, I never called him to do that profile because I didn't pursue a life of tranquility to get in front of a camera.
I did it to get out of the spotlight.
And that's what my book is about shedding your need for validation from others.
Publisher says you'll hit 2 million copies sold by next week.
Your "582 Questions With" video was nominated for a BAFTA.
- That's fun.
- Also, they want you for "Oprah".
"Oprah" is off the air.
No, they want you to take over for Oprah.
Also, this investor wants to meet you.
I checked him out, he's legit.
Tahani.
Gordon Indigo.
I just have to say you are so inspiring.
Aw.
Namaste.
I mean, you really have all these idiots fooled.
- Excuse me?
- Listen.
I'm sure you're already rolling in dough from this incredible scam, but have you thought about merch?
Because we could, uh, we could partner here.
I made a fortune selling Nirvana Orbs, which is to say, driving range golf balls that I painted silver.
- That's awful.
- No, it's healing.
Wink.
You should be selling whatever crap you can think of, because these people will buy it.
- That is quite enough.
- Hm?
And how dare you insinuate that I'm not authentic?
I finished signing your headshots.
- Oh, not now.
- Ms. Al-Jamil, it's okay.
You and I are the same.
I love what you're doing here.
You get to be rich and famous and not have to do any of the work of helping people.
But I am helping people.
You need to go right now.
Suit yourself.
Look, if you change your mind, I'm online.
Just Google "crystals" that prevent erectile dysfunction".
I'm sorry, but Ms. Al-Jamil doesn't have time to participate in an ethical study at some random university.
If you want to meet her, you can sign up for the "Get Out of the Spotlight" cruise, with special guests Deepak Chopra and Will.I.Am.
Hello?
This is Tahani Al-Jamil.
Oh, hi, I didn't think I'd actually get you.
My name is Chidi Anagonye, and I'm doing an academic study on near-death experiences and ethical decision-making.
I read an article about you Will it help people?
That's all I want to know.
Will this help people?
Yes, I I think so.
I I mean, that's the goal.
Send me the info.
I'll be there tomorrow morning.
Wow.
But how had you learned about me, I wonder?
A professor I'd never heard of named Charles Brainman sent me an article about you.
Said you'd be perfect for our study.
Well, welcome to Australia.
Oh, if you need a place to crash while you get settled, my motel has a pull-out sofa.
Although, as I say that, and I look at you and your whole thing, I realize that's absurd, and you should probably just get your own place.
Yes, I I think that's best.
- But but thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Three down, one to go.
Sup, bud?
I've been looking for you.
Oh, sorry.
Are these your rocks?
No, look.
My name is  Zach Pizazz.
International talent scout.
I've been tracking your dance troupe, man.
I think you really got the goods.
I want you to come on down to Australia and start a new crew, all right?
I'll pay for everything.
You may have a few other obligations, but basically Uh, thanks, but no thanks, man.
- I'm done with dancing.
- But wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You heard what my name was, right?
Zach Pizazz?
My life is just kind of messed up right now.
I had a really tough year.
-  - I'm sorry.
Want to talk about it?
I'm a pretty good listener.
Well, my year started about a year ago.
Pillboi, I can't breathe, and I'm freaking out, and I'm almost out of whip-its!
Pillboi!
-  - Buongiorno.
Buongiorno.
- Yo, what happened?
- I couldn't breathe.
The snorkel must have been broken.
Yo, that sucks.
- You ready to get back in there?
- No, man.
We're not doing this no more.
I almost died trying to rob a Mexican restaurant.
I have to change my life.
I know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to win this dance competition.
So you didn't see any other posters there?
No, don't think so.
Why?
Doesn't matter.
Continue.
Homies, I almost died yesterday.
But we've been given a second chance.
Three months from today, on this very stage in the Carmen Electra auditorium, right here at the Smith & Wesson Performing Arts Center and ATV Repair Shop, we are going to win this dance competition.
How, you ask?
By working.
We are going to eat, breathe, and vape dance.
I want you thinking about dance 24/7.
That means every day, you think 20 thoughts about dance for seven minutes.
And if you can't promise me that you'll give this dance crew everything that you've got, then you can walk out that door.
Right now.
Yeah, okay.
I'm out.
What?
Come on, Donkey Doug.
After all we've been through?
Listen, you know you're my boy, but this sounds like a lot of work.
Good luck.
Pew, pew.
Donkey Doug out!
Damn, that's a tough blow.
But now that those guys are no longer members of our crew, we can legally rob their houses.
No, Little Peanut.
We're going to do this the right way.
No more crime, and if you don't like that, you can walk out that door.
Right now.
What?
Co Oh, come on We still got like 35 people, so let's get to work.
Quick announcement.
Will the owner of a 1998 Toyota Tercel with golden pythons painted on both sides, license plate GOT-MILF please see an usher.
Your car has exploded.
All right, ya'll ready for the next act?
Please give it up right now for Dance Dance Resolution!
In the six-year history of this competition, no crew has ever received a perfect score from our judges.
That changed tonight.
But before we get to that, Dance Dance Resolution has been disqualified.
What?
No, why?
Because you have 40 people onstage.
The limit is eight.
Also, one of your members tried to carjack me - on my way in here.
- No, that was Donkey Doug, and he's not a part of our crew anymore.
We win!
We win!
We win, we win, we win!
No, again, you are disqualified.
And the winner is Panther Blood!
And the winner is Suck Monsters!
And the winner is Nobody.
All teams are disqualified due to violence.
Okay, well, we're out of rent money.
So remember that thing I said about no more crime?
That's over now.
Go do crime.
Yep, he just confessed to the robbery.
- Damn it!
- That was easy.
Look, please let me go.
I only did it to pay rent for my dance crew's rehearsal space.
Oh, well then, you're in luck.
We only arrest people for robbery if they don't have a reason.
Sorry it took me so long to bail you out.
No, it was my fault.
I shouldn't have used my one phone call to prank the police department.
Man, a year ago, I almost died, and I'm exactly the same as I was before.
- A failure.
- You're not a failure.
You're a dreamer.
Look, I like my job at the old folk's home.
Those old biddies are sweet, and sometimes they give me what they think are candy but are really loose Vicodin.
But when I'm with you, I feel like the sky's the limit.
I feel like someday, I'll be able to buy my own Vicodin.
And it'll never turn out to actually be laxatives.
Thanks, dog, but if my life ended today, what would my legacy be?
Sure, I did a wheelie on a dirt bike through an entire Waffle House, and I was once interviewed on the news for finding a foot on the beach.
But yo, other than that, I have no truly great accomplishments.
Bro.
I'm only saying this because I love you.
Do you want a Vicodin right now?
So I walked out of that bar, came down to this wharf, threw a rock at a snake, met a guy named Zach Pizazz, talked to him about my crazy year that I've had which started when I was locked in a safe.
No, that was me.
I'm Zach Pizazz.
- We're caught up now.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
- A year ago, if you had asked me to run a dance crew in Atlantis - Australia.
- I would have said yes for sure.
But now, and I know this sounds crazy, but I'm starting to think there might be more to life than amateur street dancing competitions.
It's funny, but I know exactly what you mean.
My goal in life used to be completely different, too.
I used to, um rep this crew called the Demons.
Whoa, I remember you guys!
Didn't you all die when someone brought a hammerhead shark into your hot tub?
Different Demons.
The point is, I had to leave my old crew behind, you know?
But I met new friends who helped me become a better person.
Look, I know this group of people who are also searching for meaning.
They might be able to help you find what you're looking for.
What do you think?
You want to go meet them?
Yeah, that sounds great.
Do we have to leave right now?
My friend gave me a pill that I realized one second ago was definitely a laxative.
No, go, go.
Well, that is the last time I'll need to head back down there.
So to thank you for your help, I brought you back something from Earth.
A little token of my appreciation.
It keeps your antimatter warmer for longer.
- It's a frog.
- Yeah.
- There's a frog on it!
- Yeah.
Right there, it's a frog!
Oh, man, it's green.
It's classic.
Oh, this guy's a jumper.
You can tell.
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.
Wow, that really went over big!
How's Jason?
Is he still cute?
- Oh, he looks about the same.
- That sounds cute.
- Hey, guys.
- Ooh, hey, Judge.
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.
- How's it going?
- So good.
I mean, everything is going according to plan, and nothing is going differently from the plan.
Yes, that's a very not weird way to put it.
I'm just stretching my legs.
Just binged like 300 episodes of "NCIS".
- Oof!
- You know, I'm not a human woman, but that Mark Harmon can get it.
You know what I'm saying?
Speaking of human cutiepies, how's that Chidi doing?
Oh, sorry, Judge.
Let me just Ooh, hey, you know what you would love - if you like Mark Harmon?
- Yeah?
"Stealing Home".
He is very sexy in "Stealing Home" according to the private thoughts of more than 7 million Caucasian women.
Oh, hot tip.
Thanks, girl.
-  - You guys want to come with?
-  Ooh.
- We can watch together.
I can whip up some nachos.
- I am incapable of eating, so.
- Suit yourselves.
- Party poopers.
- Ah, party poopers!
I guess it'll just be me and Mark, then.
Naughty, naughty.
Oh, boy.
Michael, we almost just got busted.
Yeah, but we didn't, and more importantly, Jason just arrived in Australia.
The four of them are finally together.
Oh, we did it, Janet!
We got away with it.
So this is our MRI machine.
Oh, don't don't touch that.
Each of you will get a chance in here eventually.
Hopefully, none of you is claustrophobic.
Clausterphobic?
Who would ever be scared of Santa Claus?
Oh!
The Jewish.
Are you from Florida?
- Jacksonville.
- Yeah.
That should be fine for me.
It's roughly the same size as Nicole Kidman's cryogenic anti-aging chamber, and I've never had a problem in there.
I'll be okay, too.
Kinda of reminds me of the home tanning booth I lost my virginity in.
Wow, I cannot wait to take a look at these three brains.
Oh, forgot to mention.
There's one more person who will be joining us.
Seems like a really interesting guy.
He was almost run over by a train a few months ago.
Heard about the study, emailed me last night.
This doesn't make any sense.
They're all there.
What's going on?
- Oh, no.
- What is it?
Something bad, Janet.
Something very dark and evil.
Oh, yes.
Come on in.
- Everyone, this is Trevor.
- Hey, guys.
It is so great to meet you.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Michael, a demon has infiltrated the group.
Not just any demon.
Trevor is a diabolical, sadistic agent of evil.
Might just be the single most dangerous creature in the universe.
Who wants lemon bars?
It's my nana's recipe, and they are just sinful.
Love 'em on my lips but hate 'em on my hips, if you know what I mean.
All right, new guy, coming in strong with free dessert.
You must be Eleanor, the reason this is all happening.
I am.
It's so nice to hear someone say, "Eleanor, you're the reason this is all happening" who isn't a judge in small claims court.
Thank you for this, Eleanor.
It's a wonderful thing you've done.
Mm, happy to help you out, buddy.
Oh, we're doing a long hug.
Are you crying?
Sorry, I'm just I'm just so happy to be here, if that makes sense.
Okay, the five of us narrowly avoided death.
The operating theory of this experiment is that So, I give them ethics problems, and we scan their brains, and we get a sense of their baseline moral instincts.
Right, then I'll show them pictures that trigger memories of their near-death experiences, we'll scan again, and see if we get a different result.
For example, I'll show Jason pictures of a safe, a snorkel, and whip-it canisters.
Got it.
Also, what a grim death that would have been.
Darling, do you remember all the rules about what can and cannot be worn inside an MRI?
More specifically, what if one's brassiere is very thin, but also very pure gold?
I don't know, but I'm in a similar "situ-aysh," because the sports bra I'm wearing is kind of rust-colored underneath the armpits, so I guess we'll roll the dice together.
Hey, Eleanor, do I have the right phone number for you?
You haven't responded to any of the dank memes I've sent.
Oh, yeah, I 'cause I was laughing too hard to reply.
Okay, what's your fave?
'Cause mine's "Damn Daniel".
Back at it again with the white Vans!
Should we get started, maybe?
Oh, Mrs. Teacher, for my turn, is there any way to get, like, extra radiation?
There is no radiation in the MRI.
But why do you ask?
Uh, no reason.
Jason, what do you got in your hand there, bud?
Nothing.
Is it a spider?
Yes.
Do you think taking a spider in an MRI machine will give you superpowers?
Hey, it might work.
He already bit me a bunch of times and gave me the power to swell up my hand.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
Trevor.
Hey, Mikey, fancy seeing you down on Earth completely illegally.
Sweet outfit.
Dick Tracy called.
He said you're a buttface and he's been plowing your mom.
Hey, well, Dick Tracy called me, too, first, and he said he was about to call you and say a lie about me that was actually true about you instead.
Whatever.
What are you doing here, Trevor?
Shawn hacked the judge's system, and we caught you cheating, getting your four little cockroaches to meet up.
What, you think we were just gonna sit around in the Bad Place blowing beefers while you're down on Earth boning us in the meathole?
So why didn't Shawn just go to the judge and turn me in?
Because this way's more fun, knuckle nuts.
First of all, I'm currently formulating a better comeback to your Dick Tracy burn, and it's gonna devastate you.
Second, you're too late, because when I did this experiment in my neighborhood, every time Eleanor asked Chidi for help, their bond became unbreakable, and the entire group improved.
No, you're right.
There's no way I'll get one of these bozos to drop out of an unpaid, rigorous academic study, especially when they're doing it with me, their overeager new best friend.
Well, I should head back.
You want to come with?
Oh, right, they've all seen you already, so you can't show your face to them again, so you're powerless to stop me.
Later days, dingus.
Dick Tracy called back on his watch phone and said you better "watch" out.
Shoot, second too late.
Okay, uh, Simone's gotta analyze the scans, so why don't the rest of you head home?
Good first day, everyone.
Hey, teach, um, do you think, maybe, we could continue the one-on-one lessons on the side?
I feel like last week, I had my own personal ninja master, and now I'm taking tai chi with a bunch of farting housewives.
Between the new project and my classes, I won't have time, but this is way better.
You're still gonna learn a lot, and you'll have a fun group of people to study with outside of class.
- But - Hey, gang.
I just had a neat idea.
Let's all go sightseeing.
- Dope.
- Yeah.
We can check out Sydney, get to know each other, bond.
What do you say, E Street Band?
You up for a Segway tour of Australia, mate?
This is a knife on the barbie.
Cool idea.
I'm just worried that, maybe, it's too cool.
I think I'm just gonna find the nearest bar, have one or eight drinks, and hit the hay.
Even better!
We'll all go bend an elbow.
Actually, I know the perfect place for homesick Americans.
Hey, dudes, welcome to the Cowboy Skyscraper Buffet.
Oh, hey, can we get the Florida table?
They absolutely nail the swamp stench.
Oh, someone's seated there.
But if you purchase our Manifest Destiny package for $30, you can have anyone you want forcibly removed from the table.
We'll just sit anywhere.
When your table's ready, this gun'll go off.
I think this is real.
So, listen up, y'all.
I was so excited to join the group that I made sweatshirts.
You get a sweatshirt.
You get a sweatshirt.
- You get a sweatshirt.
- I get a sweatshirt.
"The Brainy Bunch".
Awesome!
I love being on teams, and if we're on a team now, we need nicknames.
Optimus, Bumblebee, Jazz, ugh, Megatron.
That's what you can each call me.
Now we need nicknames for you guys.
Ah, this is the best!
I'm gonna get the first round, and we are all gonna toast to Eleanor, the reason we're all here.
Yay, Eleanor!
Oh, well, if you guys are celebrating, I recommend the jalapeno poppers.
Hi, there, I'm Janet.
I'll be taking care of you tonight.
Can I get you started with some drinks?
Our specialty cocktail tonight is the Fourth of July.
It's half an apple pie blended with Southern Comfort and Coca-Cola served in a Chevy hubcap.
Why don't you just go get us a round of beers?
Of course.
Here you go.
Sorry.
I will go physically pick those up, I guess, and then walk them back here with my feet.
But just so you know, I will be here all night watching everything that you order.
So, Ellie, baby, brainstorm.
We should get a house.
Me, you, Tahani, Jason we should all go in together on a place.
- Roomies.
- Roomies!
That is technically an idea.
I think it would be supes fun.
We could play pranks on each other for my vlog.
No.
We could do one of those ice bucket challenges - that I sent you.
- I don't think so.
Or maybe just a Harlem shake?
I like to cook, - and I have been dying to - Please stop.
- Experiment with Jamaican food, man.
- Please stop now.
I like Jamaican food.
Listen to the reggae, and smoke the joints.
That's a Jamaican accent.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
- Hey, how's it going?
- Not good, Michael.
I don't have my powers.
I can't summon things.
Dictionary.
Spaghetti.
Jet Ski.
Giraffe.
Gah!
Look what I've been reduced to.
Humans only live 80 years, and they spend so much of it just waiting for things to be over.
I'm all out of sorts down here too.
I'm bad at lying now.
That used to be my thing.
And every part of my body is either too dry or too wet.
It's worse for me, man.
Ever since we walked through that portal, my knowledge has stopped updating.
The instant before we left, a man in Caracas, Venezuela, named Raul Benitez was eating a ham sandwich.
Did he finish it?
I don't know, and it's making me crazy.
I got to find him.
Janet, focus on the mission!
We have to get Trevor away from the humans.
I am so glad you came out with us, man.
I just assumed you would think it's unprofessional to be friends with the subjects of your study.
No, I never thought that.
I mean, I-I kind of do now.
Should I not be socializing?
I'm sure it's fine.
I mean, how much harm could it possibly do?
Good point.
Such a good point that I'm gonna go think about how good a point that is over there by myself for several minutes.
Excuse me.
Hey, El train, you think with all these new "Star Wars" movies they'll finally make a new "Spaceballs"?
I'm sorry, I'm getting a text and I have to take this.
Okay, everybody, here are your beers.
And here is yours.
Oh, no, oh.
I guess you should go to the bathroom or maybe go home and never come back.
No worries, I made extra sweatshirts.
Besides, we're having too much fun to leave.
Hey, speaking of fun, I know this super fun drinking game we can play.
Every time one of you says something that the other can't relate to, you both drink.
Could be fun.
I once played a drinking game with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively at their macrobiotic farm with a particularly robust batch of homemade kombucha.
Do I have to drink for every word I don't know?
Up to you.
Just drink.
Hey, what happened with Chidi, and where's Eleanor?
This this is all moving too fast.
Can we just take Trevor out?
I don't know if he can die, but I could drop a steamroller on his head.
Oh, darn it, I can't summon things.
I guess I could kick him with my soft feet.
Earth sucks.
You stay on Trevor, keep interfering with his plan.
All right, and I'm going to do my librarian act and nudge Chidi back to the table.
- Uh, yummy.
- Yay!
You gotta relax, man.
You're off the clock.
It's just a simple drink with friends - at the world's worst restaurant.
- No, but Trevor's right.
I might skew the study by fraternizing with the subjects.
We can be colleagues.
Associates is pushing it.
And by even having this conversation, you're becoming my confidante.
- I can't have that.
- Jeez.
Kind of thought that before everyone else showed up, you and I were, like, becoming actual friends.
Oh, no.
You're right.
What have I done?
Okay, okay, I-I-I'm gonna go to the bar and get you a hot tea.
- Okay.
- Or a regular temperature Xanax.
Try not to fall apart.
Professor Anagonye?
Oh, yeah, I thought I recognized you.
It's me, the librarian from the library.
Oh, right, hi, sorry.
Uh, I was just kind of in the middle of something here.
Well, maybe I can help.
You know what I like to do in situations like these?
I haven't told you anything about what I'm going through.
Do that first, then I'll tell you what I do in situations such as the one you're about to describe.
I've been in every situation because I'm a librarian.
Hit me.
Go ahead.
Mm.
Ah, la-la-la-la.
Mm, I'm tired.
Does anybody want a gallon of water to sober up?
No thanks, sweetheart.
I just called a car for these two lovebirds, so why don't you just bring us the check?
Oh, and you should smile more.
You'll get bigger tips.
Gosh, you're pretty.
No, you're pretty.
Pretty beautiful.
If you ask me, Chidi, you need to get back over there, you know, spend time with the team.
Though, we do have a saying in the library game.
Um, there's only room for one male subject in an academic study, so keep the one who got there first.
Catchy.
Got to go now.
The closest thing I could find to herbal tea was a root beer I had them throw in the microwave.
You know what?
Don't drink that.
I think I'm just gonna head home.
But you can go and spend time with the others.
Yeah, man, that's not really what I signed up for.
I mean, Tahani is eh, but Jason, woof, and Trevor, blegh.
They're not the reason I flew all the way from Arizona.
You are.
I'm sorry, but this is just how it has to be.
I'll, uh, I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, E dog, get over here!
It's trivia night!
The first round questions are all about Logan Paul, and you know I'm Logang for life.
Go put your head up your own butt.
- What?
- What?
What?
Oh, don't you buttnecks ever give up?
No, and what are you even doing in a bathroom?
You're a demon.
You don't need it.
I like the smells.
And I like putting my hands in the toilet so everything I touch gets a little bit of poop on it.
Hey, you guys see what I did out there?
I am so good, I got Eleanor to leave a bar early.
Chidi's melting down.
Jason and Tahani just left together.
If they hook up, she's on the first private jet out of here.
This was too easy.
It's gonna take a lot more than that to break up this group.
Why don't you give up, Trevor?
As long as we're here, you'll never succeed.
Maybe, but how long will that take?
I mean, at some point, the judge will find out that you're not in your little room watching ticker tape.
Right?
Tick, tick, tick, tick.
But, hey, may the worst demon win.
Good luck, Mikey.
Ah, poop hands!
I can't believe you fell for that.
Are you all right?
You didn't sleep at all last night.
I got a solid eight minutes, not consecutively, but still.
It's fine.
You're not even that blurry.
You gotta take it easy, man.
I mean, you're not sleeping.
Your eye's twitching.
This study has to be airtight.
And this ethical question of friendship with the subjects is weighing on me.
I've done a million of these things.
I promise I'll warn you if you cross any lines.
I don't want to come anywhere near those lines.
I have been waiting my entire career for the right thesis, and I am not going to blow it.
I have to keep this professional.
Fine, but you need to get some rest.
This morning, you bit into a raw egg like it was an apple.
I thought it was hard-boiled.
Yeah, but still, the shell.
This is the best secret-friend handshake, bro.
And it goes Attention, everyone.
Do not look at me.
Oh, I don't don't know what to do.
I am both overhung and humiliated by my uncouth comportment last night.
Please accept these formal letters of apology.
Further apologies for their appearance.
I just couldn't find a proper calligrapher at 5:00 in the morning.
So, what happened to you two lovebirds last night, huh?
Frankly, it is none of your business.
Oh, sorry.
Jason was a perfect gentleman last night.
Thank you so much for getting me home safely.
I wouldn't blame you should you ostracize me for my boorish behavior.
You weren't boring.
You were fun.
Crazy story after you got into the cab, I forgot where I lived, but then I looked across the street, and there was a motel, and behind that, there was a dumpster.
I slept in a dumpster.
- Jason.
- No, no, no, it was fine.
And it was super fun getting to know you.
You're the fanciest person I know, next to my friend Ronnie, who drives a limo.
He's in limos all the time.
Oh, what a life.
All right, as soon as Eleanor gets here, we'll begin.
Bad news, prof.
Eleanor might not be coming.
She bailed right after you did last night.
Seemed like she was having second thoughts about being part of the Brainy Bunch, so.
Oh, well, that's disappointing in in in terms of how it affects the study.
But we press on, like professionals.
Hey, do you think I should Yeah, and I already called you a car, because you should not drive.
It's outside.
Thanks.
Where's outside?
Hey, man.
Are you okay?
Sorry, uh, literally one second ago, I was at the front desk.
I don't know where I got this.
Anyway, are you coming to class?
Uh I just don't think the group thing is for me.
I'm better when it's one-on-one and we're both looking at our phones and I don't know the other person and we don't talk.
I might just head back to Arizona.
Listen.
My whole life has been a-a torture chamber of indecision, and now I'm finally on the path to understanding why, and the only reason that's happening is because you walked into my office, and you said you wanted to be a better person.
That was really brave.
Now, I know we barely know each other, but, please, could you give me three months?
Can you give me three months?
I am I am asking you as a friend.
See, I just told you I don't like talking.
That whole thing could have been sent in a text that I pretended I never saw.
Fine, you did good at talking.
I'll come back to class.
Come in.
No?
- I'm gonna drive you back.
- Okay.
Hey, Dick Tracy called.
Said that I was right about Eleanor and Chidi having an unbreakable bond.
I don't think you understand how that joke works.
Yeah, that doesn't matter.
We won.
That's the point.
You won squat.
We're gonna get 'em eventually.
I'll just keep chipping away till one of 'em bails.
These four humans are all I care about in the universe, and there is nothing I mean nothing that's gonna come between me Oh, cool, you're all together.
The judge wants to see you.
Now?
Right now?
Um, like, all of us, or Yep.
So, this is Earth, huh?
Whoo, that's pretty cool.
Michael, how many times did I say you could go down to Earth?
Actually, you weren't 100% explicit.
One time.
I said you could go down there, save their lives, start the new timeline, and then come back here to observe them.
One time!
Is what I said.
Uno.
One.
Your Honor, I have to say, I support you one-hundo percent.
I mean, what Michael did is unbelievable.
Now, granted, I also tricked the doorman and snuck down to Earth, but what are we gonna do Do you realize what you did?
You meddled in human affairs.
That ripples out, man.
Do you know how much weird stuff has happened because of your little experiment?
England left Europe.
That Hugh Jackman musical about P.T. Barnum?
It made, like, $400 million.
Also, the Jacksonville Jaguars are good now.
Impossible.
I'm serious.
They're gonna make the playoffs.
Blake Bortles is kind of okay, maybe.
I don't know.
It's being debated amongst experts.
It's confusing.
But whatever it is, it's your fault!
Your experiment with the humans is over.
Are you gonna kill them?
No!
But starting now, there is no more monitoring them.
They're just regular humans that need to hit the regular point threshold to see if they make it into the Good Place.
- Hmm.
- And if they don't And right now, the two of you are going back to the Bad Place.
But they'll retire Michael, and I'll be marbleized.
Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you intervened in human affairs.
I mean, because of you, Byron Allen owns The Weather Channel now.
Is is that bad?
I don't know, but it's weird, man.
Now come with me.
Hey, my powers are back online.
This must be everything I tried to summon on Earth.
- Stop it.
- I don't think I can.
I'm like a printer when the print queue suddenly starts processing all the unprinted documents.
Oh, man.
Buckle up, folks.
Let's go, right now.
Janet, make it stop!
Janet, stop it.
Janet, this is annoying.
Janet.
Good luck, frog man.
Pulling for ya.
Janet, I know you're still there!
Ugh, oh.
They escaped.
Yeah, thanks, Jeff.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1   Okay.
That was an insane thing for us to do.
Oh!
Okay, good news.
I have The Doorman's key, so no one will be able to come after us.
- Let's just try to -   Your key is ringing.
I have a question for you.
Are you out of your damn mind?
Your Honor, look at it from my point of view.
I have never been this angry in my life, which is the age of the universe!
I understand, but saving the souls of these four humans is more important, so we're not coming back until we do.
Oh, don't you even try coming back here, because when you walk through that door, I am gonna be waiting for you.
Sorry, Judge, I think you're breaking up.
That's impossible.
It's a magical key, you dick.
What are you doing?
I can see you.
-  - This is perfect.
We're right near Chidi's office, and as far as I can tell, the whole floor is abandoned.
What do they use it for?
Storage?
No, this is the journalism department.
Huh, bad for the world, good for us.
So somehow, with none of our powers, we have to keep the group intact and monitor their ethical progress.
- So how how do we do that?
- Not sure.
There's no way to track people's actual point totals.
Only the Accountants have that information.
But I did install cameras and microphones, so at least we can keep our eye on them.
- Let's get peeping!
- Oh!
Oh, no.
Not a great start.
Eleanor farted, and then she blamed it on her chair.
That's gonna cost her at least a few points.
There's a bolt missing, or something.
Before we begin, Trevor is dropping out of the study.
He sent me an email last night.
"I'm sad to inform you that I am too ugly and stupid to be in the study and I'm going home to my mommy".
That was me.
I wrote that email.
It's too bad, but we press on.
We're on to Stage Two of the study.
I'm going to teach you some philosophical principles, and then, we will explore how those ideas have affected your personal moral machineries.
Sorry, Eleanor, did you say something?
No, it's my chair.
It's got this weird design.
- Your chair smells bad.
- I know.
See, another person who agrees it's the chair.
Great news, everyone.
The funding from the neuroscience department - came through.
- Oh!
And you blew it all on cupcakes?
Exactly what I would have done.
Respect.
- Eleanor?
- Uh, I'm good.
I try to avoid pointless group activities, you know?
Like office Christmas parties or jury duty.
To me, the single most awful sound in the universe is that mangled opening note of your co-worker singing "Happy Birthday".
Cool stance.
Counterpoint: these are delicious, free cupcakes.
- Get over yourself and eat one.
- Fine.
Oh, you guys, let's take a picture.
Everyone, get in, get in, and say, uh oh, say "ventromedial pre-frontal cortex".
Ventromedial pre-frontal Jaguars rule!
Hey, teach, I've been having so much fun here, but I didn't plan to stay in Australia this long, and I'm super broke.
Any idea where I can get a part-time gig?
What kind of work are you looking for?
Well, I'm really good at telemarketing.
I can usually guess how long to microwave food without looking at the box.
I'd say those are my two main skills.
- Okay.
- Dang it.
I'll see what I can do.
If Eleanor has to get a job, she'll miss class, and that will slow down her progress.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
It kind of feels like cheating.
No, no, no.
It's it's not cheating.
Think of us as a snowplow, clearing a path for Eleanor so she can more easily drive along the road of improvement.
Ooh, I love that.
You really painted a picture there.
G'day.
How can I help you?
One scratch-off lottery ticket, please.
Oh, not that one.
Keep going.
Keep going, keep going.
These tickets were printed before we got down here.
I know which ones are the winners.
And stop, that's the one.
Good old lucky number 186 from the bottom.
Here you go.
Also, that bathroom key that you lost nine months ago slid under the register, and the woman that you think is your aunt is actually your mom.
Okay, bye.
You guys, this is nuts.
This morning, I found a lottery ticket on the ground outside my apartment, I scratched it off, and I won $18,000!
- Wow!
- That's amazing!
Better luck next time.
Yes, sorry, from context, I see that is actually a large sum of money.
Jason?
Are you okay there, mate?
No.
I have to watch the Jaguars games alone on my computer at like, 3:00 in the morning on Mondays.
It's so annoying.
Everything here is in a I don't know how to describe it.
Like, a different zone of time.
No, that sounds stupid.
A different clock land.
I'll watch the game with you, Jason.
I enjoy American football.
I actually dated a player once.
But he wasn't my type, so I set him up with my friend, Gisele Bundchen.
Yeah, we got it.
We always get it.
Awesome, but if you want to watch with me, you have to learn my Jaguars cheer.
It goes: "Let's go Jags.
Kick their ass, yeah"!
Do you think you could learn that by the weekend?
- I shall do my best.
- Nice, see you then.
Why do you want to watch football with Jason?
I don't, really, but I am, these days, as you might say in America, mad horny.
- Oh, okay.
- Oh, boy.
Well, no judgments, babe.
He's a straight hottie.
You want to smash Jason, go smash.
Tahani getting together with Jason, even casually, could tear this group apart.
We have to nip this in the bud.
Well, it makes me slightly uneasy to interfere in the personal life of the man that I'm secretly in love with, and a woman I admire, but if you think we should, I I'm not going to argue.
Time to break out the old snowplow again, Janet.
Let's find Tahani a loving, supportive companion.
- Great idea.
- Oh, you know?
This is not as crucial to the mission, but I'd also love to arrange for them to get better computers.
Help them work faster.
If I'm going to the mall anyway, I might as well pick Jason up some jean shorts.
The kind with the frayed edges where you can see the pockets coming out of the bottom.
So that he can study better.
Sure.
Tahani, is that you?
Larry Hemsworth?
My goodness.
That's so funny, I just got a call from the restaurant about a jacket I left here, and now, here you are.
I can't believe you remember me.
Of course I remember you.
We dated.
I know, I just never expect anyone to remember me.
Because I'm only 6'4" and I have one of those forgettable faces.
Well, uh, I'm sure you're busy.
Probably don't want to talk to me.
I get it, I wouldn't either.
I'm as dull as a rock.
Ugh, even that analogy was boring.
I'm sorry, I'm so dull, and I'm ugly.
I'm like a rock.
Ugh, stupid Larry!
- Stop talking about rocks!
- No, no, no, Larry, please.
It's lovely to see you.
Sit down, let's catch up.
How are Chris and Liam and Luke?
-  - Sorry, no, I won't mention your brothers again.
As long as you don't mention my sister.
Oh!
Mmm-mm.
Who are you?
Do you work here?
Your name is Montgomery Wycoff.
Your ex-wife, Samantha, still loves you, but she's afraid to call.
You must show her your poetry.
Go to her.
Go to her!
Looks like you had a good night.
- I did.
- You and Jason.
Imagine that.
To be fair, I have.
Actually, I was with an ex-boyfriend.
I ran into him unexpectedly.
The reunion was a smash-ing success.
It was a pun, you see.
The we had intercourse.
- Yeah, again, I always get it.
- I do feel bad, though.
I completely forgot about watching the game with Jason.
Homies, guess what?
Yesterday, I got a Facebook invite to the Australia chapter of the Jacksonville Jaguars fan club!
Yeah, I think he's over it.
Me and two other dudes just watched the Jags annihilate the Texans!
It was super fun!
I'm completely wasted.
I got to go barf one last time, and then I'll be ready to learn philosophy!
Dude!
Okay, not perfect, but the pros outweigh the cons.
Agreed.
Happy birthday dear Chidi You guys, this whole year has been amazing for all of us.
I mean, literally every aspect of our lives has improved.
Well, I don't know about every aspect.
SuperBoard, activate!
Good morning, professor Anagonye.
I have your lesson plan ready to go.
SuperBoard, some triumphant announcement music, please.
Last night, Larry Hemsworth proposed to me, and we're moving back to London to begin planning the wedding.
- Whoa!
- Holy smokes!
Janet, red alert.
All snowplowing has to stop immediately.
So don't give Blake Bear-tles to Jason?
How are you even lugging this thing around?
I'm not sure I could bench this much weight.
Well, girls in my social class begin ring training at a very young age.
Oh, I'm throwing a little engagement party tonight at my AirBnB.
It's very last-minute.
Just come as you are.
I guess all these people came as they were?
Hello, everyone.
I'm so glad you made it.
Holy crap, Tahani.
You found this place on AirBnB?
Oh, no.
I see why you're confused.
I used "HeirBnB".
H-E-I-R.
It's an app for heirs and heiresses where we swap mansions, private islands, blimp hangars, that sort of thing.
Anyway, everyone, I want you to meet Larry Hemsworth.
Oh, the legendary study group.
I'm sorry it's taken me so long to build up the courage to meet you.
I guess you can see why.
Is he ashamed at having a perfect jaw line, and 0% body fat?
Still can't believe she wants to marry me.
A dumb old pediatric surgeon who barely has an 8-pack.
Do you know what you look like?
More importantly, did Miley Cyrus write the song "Wrecking Ball" about Chris's brother, Liam?
Wonderful.
More questions about my talented brothers.
God forbid there's a single day when I'm the special one.
No, sweetheart, don't go.
You're important, too!
Fixing babies' spines is just as valuable as acting.
Tahani booked a flight for tomorrow morning, so this party is our only chance to talk them out of moving.
Maybe we should just let them go their separate ways, and hope that they learned enough to get into the Good Place.
No, we know what'll happen.
The group splits up, they're screwed, no.
We have to isolate Larry, and convince him that he needs to stay in Australia.
Time to get into character as  Nathaniel Cookswell, mate.
- Caterer to the stars!
- Ah.
Maybe no accent.
Fine.
Vegemite canapÃ©?
Ah, might as well.
Mummy was right.
I'll always be the chubby one.
Good day, mate!
Nathaniel Cookswell.
- Caterer to the stars.
- Mm.
Is it true you're moving to England?
- Yeah, I fly out tomorrow.
- Oh, ooh, that's a long trip.
Boy, you must be a confident man.
Uprooting your life like that.
You should stay here in Sydney.
It's such a dynamic, international city that you've only seen 4.8% of.
Probably.
I reckon I know what's going on here.
You aren't real caterers, are you?
- Uh uh uh -  Who do you work for?
"Australian Inquirer"?
TM-Zed?
You just want us to stay here so you can keep mocking me.
The hideous shame of the Hemsworth family.
- Oh.
- Tahani sees through all that.
And I can't wait until we move far away from the likes of you, and I can finally take her last name.
Hate to say it, but the group probably needs a new member.
I don't know how we'll ever replace Tahani.
Do you think Margot Robbie is into philosophy?
Actually, Tahani's announcement made us take stock.
You know, Simone and I need time to analyze the data, apply for grants.
We've kind of hit a natural stopping point.
Yeah, and the next step would be to repeat the experiment with new subjects, you know, compare results.
Wait, what are you saying?
That the study's over?
We're splitting up?
No, no, no, we're just taking a break, for a year or so.
And I'm sure you're all anxious to get back home.
Yeah, I got a lot of stuff to get back to in Phoenix.
Like I have a free punch card at my spray tan place.
They'll do my left side for free, so.
No, no, no, no, no!
The whole group is splintering.
Okay, new emergency plan.
I'll deal with Eleanor.
I I know it's risky, but I don't think she'll recognize me.
And I'll deal with Sweet Cheeks I mean, Jason's butt I mean, Jason.
- Shrimp?
- Always.
So how do you know Miss Al-Jamil?
You work with her at the university?
Used to.
That study is done-zo.
I was finally starting to figure things out, and now, I have to start over from scratch, again.
Boy, I know how that goes, not wanting something to end, feeling like your little team is the last thing standing between you and oblivion, that at any moment, the universe could fold up around you, and squeeze the last breath from your dying lungs.
You're a caterer, right?
It's a very competitive industry.
The point is, I bet that if the study means that much to you, it means a lot to everyone else.
You're all just probably waiting for someone to say it out loud.
You want some cocktail sauce with that?
I would like to acknowledge the wonderful group of people who brought me here.
If I hadn't decided to get out of the spotlight of my "Get Out of the Spotlight" tour, and come here, and joined the Brainy Bunch, I never would have reconnected with Larry.
So, to celebrate our group, I had my favorite patissier whip this up.
Would any of you like to say a few words?
Eleanor!
-  - Yay, Eleanor.
If nobody minds.
Uh, I would like to address the people on this cake, I suppose.
I get that we all have meaningful lives outside this study.
Well, Tahani and Chidi do.
Jason and I are straight trash.
But just, I mean, think about how much progress we've all made since that picture was taken.
I know that what we're doing is important, and I'm not ready to stop.
And I don't think you guys are, either.
So let's all stay here and keep it going.
What do you say?
Eleanor, that was absolutely lovely.
It really was, and I'm I'm so glad that this study meant that much to you.
- But, realistically - That's cool, I get it.
No, you don't need to say it.
I I got it.
- That's all she wrote, cool.
- Are you okay?
- I hope you're not mad.
- No, I'm not mad.
I'm actually laughing, because this whole study was a hilarious, stupid, pointless joke, and now it's over, so let's hit the road.
I don't need you guys.
You don't need me.
And since you don't need me, I'm just going to take the "me" out of this cake.
- No, no.
-  Eleanor, please!
Oh, sorry, the deed is done.
Pip pip, too late.
Farewell to you, my liege.
And a jolly good Saint Ploopington's Day to all of you.
USA!
USA!
USA!
Eleanor?
Is that you?
No.
I called a cab like, 20 minutes ago.
It says it's ten kilometers away, which is I don't even know how far.
It's a little over six miles.
Is that why you came out here?
To scold me about the metric system?
No, I was about to call a cab myself.
I have an early class tomorrow.
Then, I saw my friend hiding behind a plant, and I got concerned.
Then, my friend lashed out at me again, so I'm gonna take off, and uh, leave her here with dirty leaves in her hair.
Wait, wait, wait-wait-wait.
- Wait-wait, I'm sorry.
-  I'm sorry.
Don't go.
You're a brain scientist.
Can you tell me why I did that in there?
I mostly do clinical research in neuroscience.
I don't really specialize in temper tantrums.
Maybe you need a child psychologist.
Or a binky.
That's a solid burn.
I deserved it, I did.
But please, can you help me?
Why did I do that?
Okay, here's my guess.
As humans evolved, the first big problem we had to overcome was "me versus us".
Learning to sacrifice a little individual freedom for the benefit of a group.
You know, like sharing food and resources so we don't starve or get eaten by tigers, things like that.
Okay, with you so far.
The next problem to overcome was "us versus them," trying to see other groups different from ours as equals.
That one, we're still struggling with.
That's why we have racism and nationalism and why fans of Stone Cold Steve Austin hate fans of The Rock.
No, we hate The Rock because he went Hollywood, and Stone Cold keeps it real, so The Rock's fans are the real jabronis.
Point made.
Keep going.
Well, what's interesting about you is I don't think you ever got past the "me versus us" stage.
I mean, have you ever been part of a group that you really cared about?
- I was in the Girl Scouts.
- Really?
Technically, I joined under a fake name because I wanted to steal a bunch of cookies.
See, the Brainy Bunch is basically the first group that became part of your self-identity.
And now that's breaking up, you're feeling this new kind of loss, and you're scared of going back to being alone.
I mean, that's just my guess.
The other possible medical diagnosis is that you're just a bit of a dick.
Why don't you take my cab?
I think me needs to go apologize to us.
And thank you.
The point is, I'm not really an "I'm sorry" type girl.
I'm more of a "it's your fault your car got keyed "in the movie theatre parking lot because you wouldn't shut up while watching 'John Wick'" type girl.
But I'm sorry that I freaked out.
I'm just really going to miss you guys.
- We're going to miss you, too.
- Here's an idea.
What if we all agree to a yearly reunion?
And then that way, the Brainy Bunch never dies.
Each summer, we can all stay in one of our respective houses, mega-yachts, ski chalets, what have you.
We should all meet up in Jacksonville.
My house is right on the water.
It didn't used to be, but the whole city is a swamp, and it's sinking into the ocean.
Whoo, strong pitch, bud.
Next year in Jacksonville.
Yeah.
Uh, we might not want to wait a whole year.
It's sinking really fast.
- We should have a toast.
-  Okay, I think I've figured out a plan where they stay in Australia, and only five random bystanders get hurt.
- It's called arson.
Let's go.
-  Michael, no.
We can't keep meddling forever.
It's time to park the snowplow and trust that the humans will make progress on their own.
This isn't like your afterlife neighborhood, Michael.
You can't just reset things the moment something doesn't go according to your plan.
Oh, Janet.
You're a genius.
Correct.
I know everything.
You just gave me this crazy idea.
It's so crazy, it just might fail.
It'll probably fail, but it also might work.
I open the door to the afterlife.
You keep a lookout, while I break into the Judge's chamber, and reset the timeline on Earth.
And we do it all over again, but correctly.
We won't wait a year to get them all together again.
We'll get the study going right away.
Do you even know how to reset the timeline on Earth?
No, I'm assuming that there's, you know, a knob, or or a button, or you know, maybe you maybe you unplug it and then plug it right back in.
I I don't ca there's got to be a way.
- Michael, before you do this - No, no more waiting!
This is all we have, Janet!
We have Chidi and Eleanor and Tahani and Jason, and that is it.
If we can't get them enough afterlife points to get them into the Good Place, then there's no point in us even being here.
We have to try.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Okay.
What the hell is that?
Oh.
Hey guys.
What are you doing down here?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1 What the hell is that?
Oh!
Hey, guys!
What are you doing down here?
Well, we came to get more champagne, which is right behind that magic door.
What door?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?
Who are you, and why were you talking about us?
What's the Good Place?
And what are afterlife points?
And who has the most?
And is it me?
Wait a second, I know this guy.
You're Zach Pizzazz.
He got me here from Jacksonville.
No, this is the librarian from the university.
Well, I know him as Gordon Indigo, a very rude Silicon Valley investor.
All right, guys.
I can explain everything.
Just give me one second, okay?
How do we get out of this?
Well, they heard us explaining the entire system of the afterlife, and they saw an inter-dimensional door open and close, so not a ton of wiggle room here.
But you're forgetting one, crucial piece of information Right?
You're forgetting one crucial piece of information that'll save us.
Yo!
Buddy, you have, like, three seconds to explain this crazy space door, or Chidi here is gonna beat you up.
Oh, no, I'm I'm not.
But I would like to know about the space door.
All right, I don't know what choice we have.
I'll tell you the truth.
My name is Special Agent Rick Justice, and this is Lisa Frenchy-Fuqua.
We're with the FBI.
And all of you are in grave danger.
I knew it.
Agent Fuqua and I are paranormal investigators.
We're here to protect you from demons.
No, wait, that's real.
Uh, ghouls, ghouls We're here to protect you from ghouls.
Now, I had to appear in different disguises to keep tabs on you.
But you are all involved together in this FBI case.
-  - No, we we can prove this.
We have detailed files on all of you.
Ask Janet anything.
Who's Janet?
Frenchy.
Sorry Frenchy's nickname is Janet.
I thought her nickname was Frenchy.
It is.
That's why they call her, - Lisa "Double Nickname" Fuqua.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Guys, I used to work at a place that was raided by the FBI pretty frequently.
I know a Fed when I see one.
And these two jamokes are not FBI, okay?
Who are you really?
All right, all right, fine.
Just give me one more second.
One.
- Serious question - Yeah.
- Should we kill them?
- What?
It might work!
We kill them, go back through the door, somehow grab them before they get to the Bad Place, and regroup from there.
I could kill them right now.
You know, it would be easy.
Their bodies are very poorly made.
They're mostly goo and juice.
You just take the juice out, and then they're dead.
Michael, they've seen through the door into the afterlife, and they heard how it works.
It's over.
Ah.
Fine.
I guess I'll start at the beginning.
You all died.
Well, this sucks.
So, to sum up there is a heaven and hell.
We've been to hell, and now, no matter how good we are, for the rest of our lives, we're going back to hell?
Again, it's not the classic Christian hell, but that's the gist, yes.
As soon as you learned about the afterlife, your motivation to be good was corrupted.
So you can't earn points anymore.
So sorry for eternally dooming you.
And that's our bad, guys.
So all the attempts you made to torture us we must have been in the afterlife for 100 years.
Almost 300, actually.
Well, how is it possible that all these things happened to us but no time passed on Earth?
Did you go back in time to save us?
Uh, I didn't have to because of Jeremy Bearimy.
Who's Jeremy Bearimy?
Okay.
Things in the afterlife don't happen while things are happening here, because while time on Earth moves in a straight line one thing happens, then the next, then the next time in the afterlife moves in a "Jeremy Bearimy".
What?
In the afterlife, time doubles back and loops around and ends up looking something like "Jeremy Bearimy".
This is the timeline in the afterlife.
Happens to kind of look like the name "Jeremy Bearimy" in cursive English, so that's what we call it.
Sorry.
I'm my brain is melting.
How can events happen before the ones that happened before?
It's just the way it works.
It's it's Jeremy Bearimy.
I don't know what to tell you.
That's the easiest way to describe it.
Okay, but, um what the hell is this?
The dot over the I what the hell is that?
Okay, um, how do I explain this concisely?
This is Tuesdays and also July.
- And sometimes it's never.
- That's true.
Occasionally that moment on the Bearimy timeline is the time-moment when nothing never occurs.
So you get it.
This broke me!
The dot, over the I, that broke me.
I'm I'm done.
You know what?
I'm glad this whole thing happened, because now I can go back to living my life the way I used to only caring about myself because being good is pointless.
No, no.
Please, Eleanor No, thank you.
I'm outtie.
See you in hell.
You know what I just realized?
I always say that when leaving a room, but right now it's accurate.
I will literally see all of you in hell.
- Not if I see you first.
- Let's go, Jason.
No, no look, look, you guys, this is not over.
We have to stay together!
Look, we'll figure something out!
Like, just one idea I had I could kill all of you.
That's my birthday.
Hey, buddy.
It's my birthday.
One free margarita, please.
Happy birthday!
Can I just see some I.D.?
- No.
- Why not?
Well, because it's not really my birthday.
I just want a free margarita.
Well, if I just randomly gave you a free drink, I'd have to do it for everyone.
Pretty soon I'd go out of business.
Then don't do it for everyone.
Just do it for me because it's my birthday.
Happy birthday.
Jason, I have an idea.
But it's a little risky.
I need you to act as my bodyguard like my friend, Kevin Costner, in that movie where he was a bodyguard "The Bodyguard".
No problem my cousin once hired me to do crowd control for his off-brand SeaWorld.
Well, technically, it was just a bunch of kiddie pools full of jellyfish, and instead of a killer whale, they killed a whale.
Excuse me, miss.
we'd like to buy one opera, please.
Uh, what he means is I would like to give $2 million to the Sydney Opera.
Ms. Al-Jamil, this is so generous.
With a donation of that size, we will dedicate a rehearsal hall in your honor.
Thank you, but, no.
Lovely as it sounds to add to my collection of wings and atria, the gift will be anonymous.
As you wish.
I'll draw up the papers.
Why don't you want your name on the opera house?
I love getting my name on stuff.
In Jacksonville, I got a flu virus named after me 'cause I kissed a bat on a dare.
Well, I was thinking about why I was sent to hell, as one is wont to do when one has recently been told that one had been sent to hell, and it occurred to me, I have always been held captive by my desire for attention.
Now that I know how it all ends, I just want to be virtuous for virtue's sake.
That's beautiful.
I got to say, though, if you want to do more charity, I know a way that could be a lot of fun.
Hey, you want to talk to God?
"God is dead.
"God remains dead, and we have killed him.
"Who will wipe this blood off us?
"What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent"?
Friedrich Nietzsche, 1882.
I was just trying to sell you some drugs, and you made it weird!
I've never written a manifesto before.
What are you gonna say?
It will be a complete account of everything we've learned.
from the beginning of my neighborhood to right now and then a recommendation of how we feel the afterlife could be improved.
When we turn ourselves in, we'll give it to the judge.
Hopefully she'll read it.
We failed, Janet.
But maybe one day, someone else will succeed.
Okay.
So A man i fes to.
by mi Where's the H?
This keyboard doesn't have an H. - Well - Oh, whoa, whoa, wait.
Wait, I see it, I see it!
-  -  Look what I did!
- Yeah.
- I wrote, "Micahel"!
Oh, that's Okay.
Back, back, back, back, back.
Maybe you should dictate, and I should type.
Good call.
Just laying out some early details.
Go ahead and start dictating.
Look, there have to be rules.
Every place has rules.
Ugh, fine.
Here are my rules.
Rule number one I get to do whatever I want, and you all just have to deal with it.
Rule two no more Spider-Man movies.
There's way too many Spider-Man movies!
Too many dorky little twerpy Spider-Men.
Rule three everyone leave me alone.
So you just take care of yourself.
You don't owe anything to anyone else?
If people lived that way, society would break down.
Yeah, in America, everyone does whatever they want.
Society did break down.
It's terrible, and it's great.
You only look out for number one, scream at whoever disagrees with you.
There are no bees because they all died, and if you need surgery, you just beg for money on the Internet.
It's a perfect system.
Now get me another drink.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
Well, well, well a wallet.
My rules say I get to take the cash out and keep it, because in my society, I do whatever I want, 'cause I'm awesome.
Just take it.
Take it, Eleanor.
Just Ugh!
All right, this is the address on the license.
That'll be 58 bucks.
Keep the meter running as soon as I'm done here, I'm gonna head to the airport and get the hell out of this trash country, where everyone is either a criminal or a spider.
Hello, ma'am.
Is there a Fred Booth here?
I found his wallet, and now I'm doing a nice thing and returning it because I suck.
Sorry, he moved.
I can give you his new address if you'd like.
Actually, I have some of his mail.
If you're gonna go see him, could you bring it along?
Of course.
I would love to bring some rando his mail.
Anything else you want me to schlep over?
Well, this awesome day gets awesomer.
Before the airport, we're heading to 78 Palmer Street.
Ha!
That's right next to the bar where I picked you up!
I feel like a bloody boomerang!
-  - Of course you do!
- Uh - Hello.
Sir, you, uh, can't shop here without a shirt.
Oh Sir, that'll be $880.
Here's my credit card.
Why don't you just charge it and keep it forever?
And also, here's the keys to my car.
Wait.
Do you guys have, like, a "take-a-car, leave-a-car" tray?
No?
Just take it.
Just take it.
Excuse me, sir.
Would you like some free money?
Now you can buy fingers for your gloves!
Hello, madam.
Are you poor?
Here's $5,000 for a new stroller.
Have a nice day!
You don't have to say the "are you poor"?
part.
Right.
- Hello, here's some money.
- Here you go!
- Hello.
- Here you go.
Now you can buy a bigger chin guitar!
This was a truly great plan.
Oh, thanks.
Man, there's so many times that just this amount of money would have changed my life.
I could have paid my rent.
I could have gone to a real doctor, instead of pretending I was a big dog so I could go to the vet.
You know, that gives me an idea which I suppose one could argue means that anything could have given me an idea.
Come with me!
I'm sorry, Ms. Al-Jamil, but I just don't feel comfortable processing this request.
- Why not?
- Well, it just seems a bit odd to transfer the totality of your account 131 million British pounds to the account of this person a man who is so flagrantly ignoring the "one lollipop per customer" rule.
No, I walked out and back in each time, so I'm different customers.
We're technically supposed to shut down the bank if anyone from Florida even walks in.
Look, all my life, this money has been a weight around my neck like the Heart of the Ocean necklace my friend James Cameron once gave me.
I don't want the money.
My friend Jason does.
I would like to give it to him.
If it's easier, you can just put it on a Game Stop gift card.
That does not make it easier.
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.
G'day Fred, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
I have all your crap.
- Thank you.
- And your wallet.
Oh, my goodness!
Thank you so much!
It was nothing.
Dude, I didn't take your money.
I would never even think of doing that.
No, no, no.
I'm not worried about that.
Ah.
Here it is.
I started a new job a few months ago, and I got really nervous.
So my daughter, Carolyn, drew this for me to make me feel better.
Ah, it's my good-luck charm.
Every time I'm stressed at work now, I just have to look at this, and I feel safe.
A lot of people wouldn't have tried so hard to get this to me.
You are a good person, Eleanor.
I really hope my daughter turns out like you when she grows up.
- Are you all right?
-  No, you shut up!
Sorry, it's been a weird day.
You put the Peeps in the chili pot And eat them both up You put the Peeps in the chili pot And add the M&Ms You put the Peeps in the chili pot And it makes it taste bad  I'm gonna eat all this chili and/or die trying.
Anyone want any?
I'm just gonna put it right down here.
Come on.
Dip your paws in my chili.
Scoop your little mittens right in the stew.
Professor, I can see that you're going through something, but exams are next week, so can you teach us anything?
All right, nerd.
You want to learn something?
I'll teach you something.
I'm gonna teach you the meaning of life.
How do you like them apples?
Now, over the last 2,500 years, Western philosophers have formed three main theories on how to live an ethical life.
Now, first off, there's virtue ethics.
Aristotle believed that there were certain virtues of mind and character, like courage or generosity, and you should try to develop yourself in accordance with those virtues.
The gift will be anonymous.
Next, there's consequentialism.
The basis for judgment about whether something is right or wrong stems from the consequences of that action.
How much utility, or good, did it accomplish versus how much pain, or bad.
And finally, there's deontology, the school of thought that there are strict rules and duties that everyone must adhere to in a functioning society.
Being ethical is simply identifying and obeying those duties and following those rules.
But here's the thing, my little chili babies, all three of those theories are hot, stinky cat dookie.
The true meaning of life, the actual ethical system that you should all follow is nihilism.
The world is empty.
There is no point to anything, and you're just gonna die.
So do whatever.
And now I'm gonna eat my marshmallow-candy chili in silence, and you all can jump up your own butts.
Is that gonna be on the test?
Yes.
And, no.
And you all get As or Fs.
And there is no test.
And you all failed it, and you all got As.
Who cares?
Good-bye.
-  - Good-byyyyye.
Cool lecture.
And cooler shirt.
Feeling all right?
- I feel fine.
- Hmm.
I do have a stomachache.
Why do I always have a stomachache?
Well, you just ate 50 pounds of chili, bro.
This one's on you.
Look, I know the future seems bleak.
But I have a plan.
Come with me.
No, ah, ah, leave that chili, weirdo.
A complete account of every single thing we've done and learned.
I added all the data we've gathered here on Earth - in chart and in graph form.
- Hmm.
And I added a pretty tasty little recipe for cinnamon rolls made out of pizza dough.
-  - Ha!
Maybe someone someday can learn from our mistakes.
And enact real change in the process of judging people.
But for now, Janet, old friend, we are going to enjoy our time on Earth before we're retired.
- Hmm.
- So let's get started.
I know it's touristy, but I'd really like to visit a LensCrafters.
Ooh, and I'd like to get bangs.
Hey, guys.
It it's really nice to see you.
Um is everything okay other than, you know, everything?
We've started to accept our fates.
It's all chili under the bridge.
Oh!
Good, you're all here!
Big news everyone  We got - Tacos!
- Married!
Oh, oh, yeah.
Yeah, we got married.
And then after we got married, we got tacos!
Wow!
Wow, that's crazy!
It's strictly platonic, of course.
We only did it so I could legally give Jason half my money.
We just popped over to the British Embassy and signed the papers.
That's insane, but it's also, like the 11th most insane thing to happen today, so who cares?
I need everyone to focus up.
So the four of us the six of us, really, are doomed.
Our fates are sealed.
But I think we have one move left.
We can try.
Try what?
Try to do good.
That stupid, little voice in my head told me to do something good today, and it was so annoying, but it also made a dork and his very untalented daughter super happy.
Me trying just a little bit put some good out into the world.
The six of us are not getting into the Good Place.
But there are still people in this world that we care about, so I say we try and help them be good people.
Try and help them get in.
I mean, why not try?
It's better than not trying, right?
That's a lovely sentiment, Eleanor.
Let's try.
I'm in.
I'm in, too.
I'm gonna remember this day forever because of your dope speech and also because of the great tacos I had and also because I got married and I found out I was going to hell and also I became a hundred-millionaire All right, we get it.
We get it.
It goes without saying that we're in.
Let's say it anyway.
- We're in - We're All right, you go - We're in - We're in  We're just so excited!
We're in!
What do you say, bud?
You want to join the Soul Squad?
Try to save some souls?
- Yeah.
I'm in.
-  But first, I have to go to the bathroom forever.
There you are, my love.
I was just on my way to the MRI lab.
I thought I heard your voice.
Ready to go to the airport?
Start our lives together?
Go ahead, Tahani, we're rolling.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1 Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Let's do sophomore year high school.
- Nathan Burlingame.
- Didn't like you.
Huh.
Kylie Mansard.
Thought you were cool but intimidating.
No way.
I thought she was intimidating.
That's why I shoved her into that creek.
Well, after my chili episode, I asked the administration for a one-year sabbatical and, good news, they fired me.
So I am free and easy.
Well, the rest of the Soul Squad is off helping Jason's dad.
Who are we saving?
No one from my high school, I will tell you that much.
Well, before we do anything, I have to break things off with Simone.
If I slip up and tell her about the universe, it could doom her for eternity, and I've avoided talking to her for so long, she assumed I had laryngitis, and it went too far, - and now I'm on antibiotics.
- Okay, settle down.
Your moral code means you can't lie, right?
You need to just ghost her.
Disappear.
Block her number.
Bonus, anything she left in your apartment now legally belongs to you.
I've done that to dozens of people, and all of them got over it.
Actually, none of your exes have ever gotten over you.
You're damn right they didn't.
I just wish I could end things in a way that I knew wouldn't hurt her.
Bing!
I usually appear out of thin air and there would be a pleasant bing sound, but I don't have my powers, so I'm doing my own bings now.
Bing!
Chidi, what if I could create a virtual reality simulation where you could practice different breakup scenarios?
- You can do that?
- I think so.
I do know everything about you and Simone and computer programming and virtual reality and artificial intelligence and the human brain and everything else.
I'm kind of a nerd.
I'll start building the simulator now.
Bing!
Don't Turn around.
It's embarrassing.
Bing.
Jacksonville, what up?
- Duval!
-  Duval!
Poor Larry.
But "If you love someone set them free".
My good friend and yoga pupil Sting, no last initial, told me that.
I can't wait to show you guys all the cool sites in Jacksonville.
Like, that swamp is where me, Pillboi, and Donkey Doug used to stand and try and blind pilots with laser pointers, and Maybe we should do the tour after we, you know, save your father's soul.
Oh, I've been meaning to ask.
Why are you trying to save your father?
I've heard you mention your friend Pillboi many times, but you've not mentioned your father once.
What do you mean?
I talk about Donkey Doug all the time.
I'm sorry.
The man you call Donkey Doug is your father?
Yeah.
The Donkey Doug with whom you tried to blind airline pilots with laser pointers?
- Yeah.
- The Donkey Doug who's banned from Disney World for biting Buzz Lightyear?
In his defense, he thought it was someone else.
Who?
So Michael and I have a plan to save my dad.
My whole life, Donkey Doug was always getting in trouble because of some get-rich-quick scheme.
He sold counterfeit truck nuts.
He created a sport that was a cross between dodgeball and horseshoes and everybody died.
- He glued - This should be easy.
We have plenty of money.
If we just give him money, he'll blow it.
He's gotta feel like he did it himself.
A few years ago, Donkey Doug was very close to getting his electrician's license.
So if we get him to finish the training, he can earn an honest living and be on his way to getting more Good Place points, which is why we're all here.
Okay, let's go save my dad.
- Taxi!
-   - Ha!
- Need help with your bags?
Nah, I got it.
- Oh, damn, Jason!
- Oh, dude, Donkey Doug!
You call him Donkey Doug in person?
Me and Jason are cool like that.
I don't think of him as my son.
I think of him as my boy!
I mean, I am your boy.
Yeah, but it's more like, "That's my son right there, son".
But not like, "Son, son".
But like, "My boy".
But not like Yes, yes, we get it.
Thank you.
Oh, this is my friend Michael.
Oh, crap.
You look like a cop.
Are you a cop?
Because if you are, you have to tell me, and you're not allowed to arrest me for anything you saw before I knew you were a cop.
- I-I'm not a police officer.
- Yeah, Michael's cool.
And this is Tahani, who is my wife, I guess.
Dang, nice pull, son!
How about you and me go check out my Jacuzzi and put stuff in each other?
Again, I'm his wife.
Wow, that's the first time that line has ever failed.
You must really love him.
Welcome to the family!
Come on in!
This program knows everything about your personality, Simone's personality, and all human relationships.
It can't tell you exactly what will happen, but it will approximate Simone's reaction to anything you say to her.
Plus, it has Tetris.
Hmm, would this work with, say, me and, say, Jason Statham and instead of a cafÃ©, it was, say, a room with a futon and a bunch of Red Bull?
Why is it that every time a new thing is invented, humans immediately try to use it for porn?
- Because we're disgusting.
- Huh.
Eleanor and I will be watching on the monitor.
We'll see what you see.
Put these in your ears.
They'll play a tone that will trick your brain into seeing what I've programmed.
Ah Wow, so this is - I'm here.
- Hey, babe.
What did you want to talk about?
Go ahead, Chidi, practice what you want to say to her.
Right.
Um Simone, this has been the best year of my life because of you.
Unfortunately, I have come to learn some information, and it means that we have to end this relationship.
- What information?
- I - can't say.
- Why not?
I-I can't say.
Well, you've either gone crazy, or you're too much of a coward to tell me how you feel.
- Which is it?
- I-I can't because of -  Janet!
- Who's Janet?
And why are you screaming her name into the sky?
You know what?
Whatever.
- Good-bye, Chidi.
- No.
No.
No.
Wait  So - that didn't go great.
- I disagree.
I thought it was hilarious.
So, Donkey Doug, Jason told us about your electrician license, and we have a career opportunity for you.
Yo, later for that.
I got a business proposition for you.
Pillboi!
- Oh, dip!
Jason!
- Oh, dip!
Pillboi!
- Oh, dip!
Pillboi!
- Oh, dip!
Donkey Doug!
- Oh, dip!
Jason!
- This is remarkable.
- It explains so much.
- Oh, dip!
Pillboi!
Jason, I thought you were dead.
But I was alive.
I was in Australia.
I talked to you on the phone last week.
- Yeah, but I forgot.
- Oh.
Me and Pillboi have been cooking up something real special.
And this time, it's not fake meth.
All right, Pillboi, tell him about our new product.
Sharks, how much do you spend on energy drinks and body spray in one week?
Three hundred dollars?
Ten hundred dollars?
What if I told you there was a product that combined these two things for one solution to all of life's problems and more?
I give to you Double Trouble!
The world's first energy drink/body spray.
So do you spray it on yourself, or do you drink it?
- You both it.
- This is the one, Jason.
We're gonna be so rich.
I'll finally be able to pay to have my calf implants moved back up from my feet.
This is gonna be a lot tougher than we thought.
Tell me about it.
Double Trouble sounds amazing.
We should bid fast.
The other sharks are gonna want in.
So I just have to be simple, honest, and declarative and somehow still protect her feelings.
I don't know, man.
Maybe just tell her that you're gay.
- I'm not gay.
- Fine, bi.
- I'm not bi either.
- Why not?
More guys should be bi.
It's 2018.
It's like, get over yourselves.
Is there any way I can try a bunch of different things in a row - to see what works?
- Bing.
Sure, if you want to reset, just snap your fingers.
Also, I made some modifications to the tone, so it should make your transition easier.
Oh.
Mm!
Hey, babe.
What did you want to talk about?
Well, I don't love you anymore.
- What?
- No, no.
You don't understand.
I don't technically love you in the same way because of circumstances.
What?
Hang on.
I don't know how to tell you this, but I'm dying.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
Because we're all dying slowly, when you think about it.
We start dying the moment we're born.
So not a lie.
Okay, here it is.
I'm just gonna be perfectly honest.
My real name is Special Agent Rick Justice, FBI.
Nope.
Simone the last year has been truly amazing, and with that in mind - Will you marry me?
- Yes!
Yes!
Of course I will!
Oh!
Wait, what am I doing?
Why did I think this would work?
Chidi, I'm gonna go ahead and reboot this one myself.
Yeah, good call.
- So, Simone - Wait.
Before you say anything, - I think we should break up.
- You do?
Yes, I love and respect you very much, but we're heading in different directions.
And don't worry, we don't have to make a big thing of it.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
This is the one.
Remember everything.
Right leg crossed over left.
Coffee's right there.
Oh, one more thing.
Suck it, you doink.
- Sorry?
-  This is Eleanor, you idiot.
Janet let me mess with the simulator to screw with you.
- Janet, come on!
- Hi, Chidi.
This is Janet now.
Sorry, it won't happen again.
- Thank you.
- Psych!
It's still Eleanor!
I can't believe you fell for that, you doink.
-  -  We need to break up, but here's a puppy.
Aw!
Wait, what?
He's a puppy, it's over between us, and he's cute.
Do you think I don't hear the bad parts - of these sentences?
- His name is Martin, I need my keys back, and he's a puppy.
You are very bad at this.
That's because I don't actually want - to break up with her.
- What, do you need me to break up with her for you like we're in middle school or something?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, please.
- Do that for me.
Please.
- Fine.
Hey, Eleanor.
Hey.
What did you want to talk about?
Well, first of all, you and Chidi are so great together.
He really loves you, and I can see why.
You know, you're brilliant, charming, obviously gorgeous.
- Aw, you're sweet to say that.
- And your accent is so cute.
Your accent is so cute.
What?
I don't think I have an accent.
I don't think I have an accent.
Stop it!
What is happening?
No!
No.
This is over.
Whoa, man, come on.
It was just getting good.
Let's remember the mission.
Your father needs to focus on long-term stability.
Also, and perhaps this is less important, but there's an awful lot of dog hair on the furniture, and I have not seen a dog.
Not bad, right?
Double Trouble comes in three delicious smell-flavors: Raspberry Perspirant, Cedarwood Melon Blast, and 24-Hour Lemon Musk Xtreme.
That one is also a lube.
Look, Donkey Doug, Double Trouble is dope.
On that much, we can all agree on.
But you got to think long-term.
You were good at electricity stuff.
You hooked us up with free porno channels every year ever since the third grade.
It's good, honest work.
Honest work?
Whatever, Dad.
You're his dad.
This is huge, J. When Double Trouble pops off, I'll be able to quit my job at the old folks' home.
Buy a big-ass mansion.
Every day, I'll wake up, get out of bed, brush my teeth, rinse, go downstairs, open the fridge, "Damn, we out of milk," get in my car You don't have to run through the whole imaginary day.
Jason, I believe in Double Trouble.
Why won't you believe in me?
Well, I suppose a little entrepreneurial spirit never hurt anyone.
You know, reach for the stars, as I said to my good friend Elon Musk.
And then he shot his car into space.
What a weird creep.
Why was I friends with him?
Maybe this is what'll put your father on the right path.
And, hey, it's not like he's robbing a bank.
Yeah, it's a factory.
- Excuse me?
- Tonight we're gonna steal some energy drinks from an energy drink factory, then still some cologne from a cologne factory.
So it's actually two factories.
Then we just got to bottle it all up.
Ah, dip, we gotta rob a bottle factory.
- Three factories.
- Three factories.
Stupid Donkey Doug.
I mean, two factories I can understand, but but three?
You you might want to consider the possibility that your father's a lost cause.
I have an idea, but I need your help.
Will you guys help me?
I mean, yeah, that that's why we're here, Jason.
What's your idea, darling?
We're gonna save Pillboi.
Okay, real life.
I think I'm ready.
I've analyzed the ten most successful scenarios and compiled the statistically most effective breakup strategy.
Who said you weren't a romantic?
Every girlfriend I've ever had.
Ooh, there she is.
Okay.
Wish me luck.
- Oh, hi.
Uh - Is something wrong?
No, it's just that we're usually over there.
Doesn't matter.
Okay, so I've spent a lot of time thinking about everything that's happened in the last year Hi there, what can I get you to drink?
I'll have an iced tea, please.
- Mm-hmm.
- Water, thanks.
It's been a time of massive personal and professional growth Sorry, sugar with that iced tea?
- Yes, please.
- Right.
All in all, it's been overwhelmingly positive, and I think that's due in large part to you Sorry, real quick, I'm gonna go on break, so Helmut will be taking care of you.
Hello.
Will you be eating with us today?
Just please give us one second.
Yeah, okay.
One.
That was one second.
That was a joke.
Please get out of here, Helmut!
- Okay, yeah.
- All right, look, just we need to break up.
I am I am breaking up with you.
- Why?
- I can't it's it's complicated, but it's happening.
Ya dumped.
- Okay.
- Wait.
Wait, no.
Come back, please.
- Yeah, okay!
I'm back.
- Not you, Helmut.
Hey, now, listen, Judy, you can't mix xannys with these little pink fools.
You'll be tripping balls like Clarence was when he crawled into the ice machine.
-  - Here.
Take half of one of these, wash it down with a 5-Hour ENERGY, and you'll be golden.
Body high with mild visuals.
Thanks, Pillboi.
Yo, I gotta take off 'cause I gotta go do a robbery.
I mean I'm sick.
Hello, Pillboi.
I'm here on behalf of Jason.
You won't be attending the job with Donkey Doug today.
There's been a change of plans.
Okay.
That's it?
You don't need any more information?
I mean, do you want to tell me?
- Not really.
- Cool.
Want some pills?
I hate this.
What if I ruined her?
What if I sent her down the wrong path and she ends up in the Bad Place?
I have to undo what I did.
Janet, fire up the simulator.
Dude, no more simulations.
Just talk to her.
Breakups never end with both people feeling great.
But she's a badass, and her world is bigger than your relationship.
She'll recover.
Just go.
Be a person.
Right.
Here I go.
Janet, can I use the simulator?
There's a very specific Lenny Kravitz concert - I want to be front row at.
- Sure.
FYI, when the system boots up, you might find yourself in a steam room with Jason, who will be wearing an old-timey strongman onesie.
It's a bug in the system.
Pillboi?
No, it's me, Pillboi's friend Jason.
Pillboi's not coming.
If you're here to tell me an energy drink body spray is a bad idea, I've heard it before from a bank and some doctors.
I'ma help you make Double Trouble, but you got to leave Pillboi alone from now on.
I'm trying to save him.
Oh, dip.
You got religious and shiz?
- Amen.
- Amen.
Okay, hurry up and get this crap in my truck.
Jacksonville Police!
Come out with your hands up!
Are you a cop?
'Cause if you are, you have to tell us.
Yes, this is the police.
Yup, I knew it.
It's the cops.
What do we do?
Yo, let's get out of here.
No.
I know I haven't been the best father in the world.
I might not have even been in the top five.
I wanna make up for that.
I'll distract 'em.
You run out the back.
No, that's crazy.
It's what my dad did for me and his dad for him.
And someday, you'll do this exact thing for your son.
I mean, I hope not, but thanks, Donkey Doug.
Hey - call me Donkey Dad.
- Okay.
Donkey Dad.
Nah, that sounds wack.
Call me Donkey Doug.
Cool.
Bortles!
Uh Here's the truth.
You're amazing.
And my feelings have changed.
I wish I could tell you why.
I really, really do, but I can't.
Well you seem to know what you want, which is rare for you.
Well, I hope you keep the study going.
Might help a lot of people.
Well see you in the next life.
What?
Why would you say that?
What do you know?
It's a figure of speech.
You're so weird, man.
I think maybe this is for the best.
So your covert mission is to continue to report to this job until you receive our signal.
Now, this is the most important thing.
You cannot commit any more crimes, and you must help these people as much as you can.
- The mission depends on it.
- Roger that.
Man, I can't believe this whole time, you guys were with NASA.
Yes, we are secret astronaut spies.
That is indeed what Jason told you.
Take good care of these old fools, and stay out of trouble.
I love you, bro.
I love you, bro.
- Psych.
- I got you, bro.
- I got you, bro.
Jag - uars  Rule.
Well, my sister's museum exhibit opens tomorrow.
Are you all ready for some Al-Jamil family reconciliation?
You know it, wifey.
Soul Squad is on a roll.
I pretty much nailed that Pillboi thing, and I got closure with my dad, Donkey Doug.
That remains depressing, but I'm happy for you, bud.
I never got to do that with my parents, and now they're both dead, so it's impossible.
So the thing is, one of your parents is not technically actually dead.
- What are you talking about?
- Your mother's alive.
She faked her own death.
I'm sorry, Tahani, I don't think I'll be able to stay with you here in Budapest.
Turns out my mom isn't dead, so I need to fly back to America to murder her.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1 So my mom is alive, and she lives here.
Why didn't you tell me sooner, man?
I had already told you that you died and that I had tortured you for centuries and that you're doomed to be tortured again.
I just didn't want to be, like, a bummer.
But now you know everything important about your life.
I promise.
A police officer came to my home and told me that my mom had been accidentally trampled to death when she bent down to adjust her toe ring at a Rascal Flatts concert.
That police officer was an actor.
See, about a month before, your mom had gotten drunk, wandered into a charity auction, and bid $30,000 for a date with Gene Simmons, outbidding everyone else by $29,800.
She didn't want to pay, so she faked her death, moved to Nevada, and reinvented herself as Diana Tremaine.
Diana Tremaine is my fake ID name.
- I -  How dare she steal the identity I stole?
Look, I know this is a lot to take in, but we're here to help your mom get into the Good Place.
Whatever you're feeling, remember, this is not about you.
Right.
How could you do this to me?
Yay, you found me.
What the hell, Mom?
Okay, baby, I can explain everything.
Let's all just take a breath.
You haven't even introduced me to this stretched-out, sexy Alex Trebek.
I'm Michael.
It's nice to meet you, Donna.
Oh, uh, it's Diana now for, you know, police reasons.
By the way, whose McMansion is this?
My boyfriend Dave's.
He's kind of a dork but real sweet and so fancy.
His napkins are made out of, like, shirt material.
Cloth.
Okay, now this is making sense.
You change your name, bag a rich loser with a tacky house.
I get it.
You're running a scam.
No, baby, this is as real as the nails under my acrylic nails.
- I'm a different person.
- Spare me.
You will always be sun-baked Arizona trash, - and I know that -  because I grew up baking right beside you.
Oh, jeez, I didn't know we had company.
- Hey.
Hi, I'm Dave.
- Michael.
Of course you're Dave.
Hey, Dave, you and I need to have a little conversation.
- Diana!
- Oh, hey.
Who the hell is this chick?
This is my little potato pie, Patricia.
And who might you be, by the way?
Eleanor is my sorority sister.
Right.
Good old Kappa Zeta Jones.
- Oh.
-  I can't believe I have to wait in line to see my own sister.
I have never waited in any kind of formation before, let alone a line.
Wow.
Is this whole room just her work?
Don't be fooled, Chidi.
Kamilah is a charlatan.
All she has to do is paint some dumb shapes, and people go mad.
Those aren't dumb shapes.
They're a pair of boobs.
And then two extra side boobs.
It symbolizes that boobs come in all shapes and sizes and distances apart.
Ugh.
Maybe we should just go.
There are plenty of other people I could help, like my good friend Ben Affleck and his crippling addiction to back tattoos, or my other good friend Matt Damon and his crippling addiction to my friend Ben Affleck.
It's important that you make amends.
Your competitive relationship with Kamilah is largely the reason you didn't get into the Good Place.
It stands to reason that the same would be true for her.
Fine.
But the waiting is over.
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
Tahani, were you waiting in line to see me?
That's hilarious.
As a frog stares up in awe at the tree top, so, too, does humanity gawk at the purity of a blinding truth.
Napkins and forks are in the back.
So making omelets is art now, is it?
Not that I'd expect you to understand, but it's a commentary on the world's fascination with subservience, consumption, death, and pedagogy.
Cheddar or Swiss?
Oh, no, I don't want an omelet.
I just came for a quick sisterly chat.
My sister, Tahani, refuses to order an omelet.
As a result, the exhibit is now over and will never be shown again.
- There will be no refunds.
-   Hey, now.
I just checked my Apple Watch, and it's marg-o-clock.
So, Michael, what do you do?
Ah, well, uh, I'm an architect.
- Get out of here.
Me too.
- Ah.
Dave's real good.
You should see the new Hooters on I-15.
It looks classy, like a bank.
So how did you two love-rats meet?
Oh, it's a fun story.
I was working on this project tearing down a condemned bar called the Desert Rash.
I went in to meet with the contractors, and Diana is sitting at the bar drinking a 7 and 7 and 7.
7 shots of Seagram's 7 in 7 minutes.
It's Diana's morning drink.
Oh, that's right, it was very early in the morning.
-  - Well, this little spitfire finds out it's me who's closing down the bar.
Next thing I know, she's got a knife to my face.
I would have been scared if she hadn't been the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen in my life.
Oh.
One thing leads to another, and all of a sudden, we're playing tonsil tennis on a broken toilet - in the alley out back.
- Cute.
So how did you and Eleanor become friends?
Let's just say that we "lived" in the same "neighborhood".
Oh.
What a fun way to say a normal thing, right?
Well, I've got to go get ready.
Today is PTA elections, and I'm running for secretary.
And she's a shoo-in, too.
Hey, Patty, we got to get ready, okay?
I know we came here to set your mom on a better path, but I think she's doing pretty great.
Please.
She's completely full of it.
I am gonna find out what kind of scam Donna Shellstrop is running, and I am gonna take her down right after I finish this awesome drink.
Man, Dave's margaritas are amazing.
- Right?
- Yeah.
And I'm not even a tequila guy.
Wow.
So this is what a museum looks like.
If you look at this painting closely, you can really notice the interpretation.
I know you're just being silly and effortlessly charming, but you actually just picked the most valuable painting in the entire museum.
As of last year, that work was valued at $39.2 million.
Oh, snap, I forgot you know everything.
How much is that one worth?
That one is worth $13.7 million.
That one's got a bunch of colors.
That's got to add some value.
Can we do this for all the paintings?
Look, I've had a sort of revelation about the world, and I'd like to take responsibility for my part in our fraught history.
For whatever hurt I've caused you I sincerely apologize.
Thank you.
I do not accept your apology.
Is that all, then?
Well  - Ooh!
-   Check out what Dave gave me plans for a Subaru dealership/burlesque club he's designing in Reno.
Man, Nevada's a mess.
What are you doing?
Searching for the tell-tale sign of a Donna Shellstrop scam a pile of cash hidden somewhere so she can grab it and head out on the run.
When the time comes, she will rip this guy off and disappear like Keyser Soze, right after he admitted to groping all those people.
Why are you in my room?
Oh, hey, girl.
What's up?
How old are you three?
- I'm nine.
- Cool.
I don't know anything about kids.
Hey, has Diana ever made you hide, like, a special treasure in any of your toys?
No, Diana's very nice to me.
She bought me most of these stuffed animals.
Oh, wow.
Neat.
Mind if I give them just a little surgery just to check?
Okay, okay, okay, all right, Doc McStuffins, let's get you some fresh air.
So sorry.
She's a kid.
You can't disembowel her toys.
Fine.
New plan.
You casually mention that you're rich and seduce Donna.
When she goes for you, it will prove that this whole thing is a sham.
First things first, do you have a penis?
I will not seduce Donna.
For one thing, I could never do that to my pal, Dave.
It goes against the architect's code.
Also, your mother seems happy here.
The Donna I know wouldn't be caught dead in this suburban boredom factory.
She's scamming them.
Look, believe me, don't believe me I don't care.
I'm gonna prove it.
Young lady, you will stop this nonsense.
Go to the PTA meeting and support your mother.
I won't hear another word about it.
What the hell was that?
Well, I was going for the "stern but, you know, caring dad" vibe.
No?
Didn't work?
No, not even close like, not in the ballpark.
I was trying something, Eleanor.
Give me a break.
Until Kamilah accepts my apology this open wound will hinder any progress she might make toward getting into the Good Place.
Also, I'm going to strangle her, which will hinder any air from getting into her lungs.
- Can I talk to her?
-  Maybe we should try a little third-party mediation.
Uh, hi.
I'm Tahani's friend, Chidi.
Chidi is an Igbo word that means "God exists".
That's right Sorry, I don't know the etymology of your name, but All of your fears are now mine.
- What did she say?
- What?
I don't know.
Sorry.
I got distracted.
She's amazing.
All of my fears are hers now.
Of course they are.
Um I sincerely apologize to you because I have matured into a fully formed adult with empathy and self-awareness.
But if you don't accept my apology, I will smash your stupid art exhibit into bits.
More Tahani theatrics with zero follow-through?
You don't have it in you to do anything that bold, because I'm the one who got the boldness gene and the good-eyebrow gene.
Oh!
Oh, no.
All my fears are mine again.
Hey, Davey, can you believe the design of this room?
Auditorium?
More like Audi-bore-me-um.
Savage.
Hello, I'm Diana Tremaine.
I never thought I'd run for PTA board.
For most of my life, I preferred to crawl pub crawl.
But now I want to make sure kids in this decommissioned-military- bombing-test-site- turned-suburban-township get the best education Nevada has to offer.
What's that always double down on 11?
Also, there is a pretty great kid who goes to this school, and I want to make this place great for her.
- Stand up, sweetheart.
-  Well, it was the first Hooters ever made out of brick, sort of inspired by Monticello.
- Hey, mark.
- Oh, no, it's Dave.
Oh, I know your name.
I'm calling you a mark.
Easy.
I got news for you, dad-bod.
The woman you know as Diana Tremaine is really Donna Shellstrop, my much older mother.
She faked her death and changed her name.
Sorry to burst your bubble, but that's the deal.
I already knew all that, Eleanor.
Your mother told me everything the first night we met.
The first night?
Well, no, not the first night, actually.
That was mostly sex.
Your mother is a very confident and selfish lover.
- Yikes.
- No, no, no, it's perfect for me 'cause I don't know what I want.
But anyway, the next morning she told me everything.
And we're gonna tell Patricia once she's a little bit older.
For now, everything is going great.
No, dude, you don't know my mom.
She used to put, like, 50 things in a shopping cart, then go to the "12 items or less" aisle, scream "rat," and run out the door without paying.
She is a liar.
Well, listen, she has been nothing but honest with me.
And I like that she's got a wild streak.
It kind of gets my motor running.
Tell you the truth she's turning me into a bit of a bad boy.
I mean, who am I Avril Lavigne?
Oh, I get it.
Coming clean was all part of the scam.
It's brilliant because he thinks she's honest.
So, when she runs off with all his money, he'll never see it coming.
Come on, Eleanor.
I changed, you changed, maybe she changed, too.
No, no way.
Why can't you accept that she might be living a good, honest life?
That she's an attentive partner and a good mom?
Because I wanted that mom.
I wanted the mom who made me afternoon snacks instead of just telling me to look for loose fries in the McDonald's ball pit.
Why does Patricia get that mom?
If Donna Shellstrop has truly changed, then that means she was always capable of change, but I just wasn't worth changing for.
I know as your self-appointed father figure, I'm supposed to say something comforting here, but I'm I'm kind of stumped.
Okay, final tally 43 votes for Diana Tremaine, 12 votes for Eileen Capshaw, and one vote for Bofa Deeznutz.
God, don't look at me like that.
You're not my real dad.
Congratulations, Madam Secretary.
It's so crazy, right?
I'm gonna need to get a calculator and maybe a globe.
I don't really understand the job.
Listen, um, I'm sorry that I didn't think this whole thing was real.
I just never thought I'd see the day when you made a commitment to anything.
I was wrong.
Thank you, baby.
That means a lot.
- Let me help you.
- No, no, no, not that one!
Not that one!
No, sorry, sorry.
This powder is only for my delicates.
You don't wash your bras.
No.
No.
I knew it.
My mother is a con artist.
Got ya.
So, before I'm tortured in the afterlife, I get to spend the rest of this life in a Hungarian prison for destruction of art.
That's fun.
Destruction of extremely derivative art.
Kamilah's work has been mediocre for years.
Mother and Father are probably rolling over in their cryogenic chambers.
Really?
You don't think they would be proud of her for having a whole museum wing dedicated to her work?
My parents' standards were incredibly high, and they were impossible to please.
Plus, they always pitted my sister and me against each other.
The two of them were a unit, and Kamilah and I  Girls, we have a new challenge for you.
Each of you has four hours to complete a rendering of your favorite moment in French military history.
The winning painting shall be hung in our foyer during our party honoring Francois Mitterrand.
The losing painting shall provide the kindling for the fire that rages in our hearth during that party.
Doesn't that sound wonderful?
Yes, Mother, it does.
Thank you for this opportunity.
Who will be the winning artist, and who will fail?
Let's find out.
These paintings they're us.
You're the boobs?
Sorry.
Once Jason said it, that's all I can see.
Here we go.
What?
Tahani, what are you doing?
Stop it.
No.
I'm going to hug you because I love you and because you feel just as alone as I do.
I'm sorry our parents were such wankers.
And I understand that you can't accept my apology because that would quench your creative thirst.
They forced us to compete, and that competition has fueled your art for decades.
It's so awful, and I'm so sorry.
They were wankers, weren't they?
Ah!
The absolute biggest wankers on Earth.
Let them go, please.
Diana Tremaine, you little devil.
New name, same game.
Fine.
Things have been going good with me and Dave, but sometimes I sneak a little bit of cash out of his wallet, and I hide it away, just in case everything blows up and I need to skip town.
Are you happy?
Actually, no, I'm not happy, but I think you are.
You're holding on to this exit strategy, telling yourself that you can bail at any time, but the truth is you love this suburban life.
I don't love it so much.
I am not basic.
Ya basic.
No, Mom.
Ya basic.
And that's okay.
Let me ask you something.
Why are you wearing yoga pants?
Well, on Tuesday nights, I do restorative yoga with a bunch of moms from Patty's school.
And what do you do after yoga?
We split avocado egg rolls at the Cheesecake Factory, but we also drink.
- What do you drink?
- Chardonnay - with ice cubes.
-  And after one glass, I get sleepy, so I usually switch to water so I can drive home like a nerd!
Hey, hey  It's okay.
It's good.
You're happy here.
But you need to commit to this which means getting rid of that stash of escape money.
And I think you know what you have to do with it.
Send it to Gene Simmons?
What?
No.
Spend it on Patricia.
Set up a college fund, buy her a crib or a car.
I truly don't know anything about kids, but this is your chance to break the chain of Shellstrop mother-daughter crappiness.
You have a do-over.
Use it.
Oh, baby.
It seems like you've turned into a really good person, and you clearly didn't get that from me, so props to whoever helped you.
Is there more cash in your bra?
Always.
It's why I don't wash them.
I still can't believe that police officer pulled you over just to tell you that you were driving perfectly.
Why not?
I was.
There is an article in the paper about Kamilah's latest art installation.
And look "A Fractured Inheritance" by Kamilah Al-Jamil and Tahani Al-Jamil.
Gosh, that was very big of her though she really should have named the piece "Buried Hatchet," don't you think?
Such a better title.
I'm going to call her and rub it in.
Maybe don't for now.
Yes.
Smart.
- Good luck, buddy.
-  Oh, hey, I almost forgot.
I sketched you up a little something some ideas there for your project.
- Wow.
-  Well, this is more than a few ideas.
You solved the whole thing columns and porticos.
Uh-oh.
Looks like you forgot to include bathrooms.
Oops.
Ah, just a little oversight.
I certainly use the bathroom like anybody else.
I love to sit on the the thing and just, you know, shoot one out.
Eleanor, I'll be in the car.
It was really nice to meet you, Patricia.
Got a lot of people who care about you here.
And good luck with the - SATs.
- I'm nine.
Whatever, good luck in school.
You get it.
The others are on their way back from Budapest.
We'll be picking them up in a few hours.
Oh, be happy.
Your mom found a better path all on her own, and you definitely helped Patricia.
Double happy ending.
I know.
I'm just I'm a little sad.
I'm glad my mom has changed, but that doesn't fix all the damage she did to me.
Let's face it she's the reason I could never get close to anyone.
I never even told a boyfriend I love him.
Oh, crap.
Um you remember how I told you that you knew everything important about your life?
Well, I-I wasn't thinking about your afterlife life.
In one of the reboots, you and Chidi fell in love deeply, and you told him that you loved him, and he told you that he loved you back.
We did what, now?
You want to listen to a podcast maybe?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1 This library's depressing.
All they have in the Poetry section is Jeff Foxworthy books.
Well, we needed someplace deserted, and there's no place more deserted than a public library in Arizona.
Now let's go, man.
We only have a few hours before we have to pick the gang up from the airport.
Fire up Janet's memory gizmo.
Flooding your brain with memories from the afterlife is dangerous.
In one of the reboots, you and Chidi were in love.
Can't you just take my word for that?
No, dude, I can't.
My screwed-up relationship with my parents made me believe I could never really love anyone.
I need to see it for myself.
Those are my memories.
I want them back.
Okay, fine.
Have a seat.
Luckily, before we shut the neighborhood down, Janet saved a complete record of all the reboots.
Put those in your ears.
- What's all that for?
- You'll see.
We're gonna start with a simple, three-second memory.
- Why only three second -  Oh, hi, Eleanor.
Buongiorno, Eleanor.
Morning, Bambadjan.
Morning, Vicky.
Ugh.
Those two are such forking dweebs.
As I told you, recalling afterlife memories here on Earth has some significant side effects.
You should be back to normal in about 20 minutes.
Ah, looking a little better.
The banana must have helped.
Before we go any further, I have one very important question.
Did I look hot bald?
'Cause I always kind of felt like I could pull it off.
I have no real ability to gauge physical attractiveness in humans.
But no, you did not pull it off.
Okay, that short clip should have rewired your brain, like an inoculation.
So now I can show you the highlights of reboot 119.
I'm skipping all of the sleeping and chewing.
You guys are always either sleeping or chewing something.
So, we are moving onto the subject of free will versus determinism.
We are officially done with Nietzsche.
Aww.
I'm gonna miss Nietzsche.
I spent a lot of my life thinking I was better than everyone else, and he showed me why I was right.
Give me that reading list.
What do we got?
Ooh, a little Aristotle, little Descartes, little Tommy Quine-Quine.
That's what I call Saint Thomas Aquinas.
Two months of philosophy class, and you're already  What are you grinning at, weirdo?
Come on, we're gonna be late for the neighborhood meeting.
I gotta say, it seems - like I was really nailing that philosophy class.
-  Can you believe my high school voted me "Most Likely to Die Young and Unaccomplished"?
You did die young and unaccomplished.
Fair enough.
- Put those back in.
-  Ah!
My favorite four residents.
Don't tell the others.
Welcome to "Pick a Pet Day".
We have hundreds of beautiful animals for you to choose from.
And when you do make your choice, your pet will bond to your soul forever.
Fabulous.
I haven't had a pet since Barbra Streisand gave me one of her cloned Siamese cats, and it killed itself.
- Ah.
- I'm going to look at the mythical pets, darling.
Catch up when you're ready.
- May I?
Yeah?
- Yes.
Dude, we can get mythical animals?
Maybe I'll get a penguin.
Penguins are real.
That's the spirit, Eleanor.
They're real to me too.
-  -  Ooh!
This one looks just like the one I had when I was a little kid.
He's so cute!
But is is this one a little a little cuter?
I mean, this pup looks friskier.
But this one looks a little a little sweeter.
- Maybe - Uh-oh.
It's Chidi kryptonite, a choice between any two things.
Settle in, lizard.
This is gonna be a while.
Michael, what's a "Mirror Centaur"?
Ah, a stunning creature, whose human half takes on the image of its companion.
-  -  Greetings.
I am T'Hania, Goddess of Beauty.
Oh my.
I mean, should I take the cutest puppy, or is that shallow?
And is it even okay to separate them?
Are they brother and sister?
Or or perhaps, married?
Dude, they're heaven puppies.
I'm sure they're both incredible.
Just choose one.
You're right.
The black one.
That was my first impulse, and that is the one I'll take.
I'm so sorry, Chidi.
Both puppies have been taken.
Yeah, I should have seen that coming.
My indecision has once again cost me happiness, and I will now suffer the consequences.
How many pets have gone unclaimed?
Three.
A 16-foot albino python - Mm-mm.
- Something called a "tarantula-squid," and this owl.
The Tarantula-squid.
Tarantula-squid.
Tarantula-squid.
Tarantula-squid.
I'll take the owl.
-  - Check it out.
Janet made him a little cowboy hat.
Isn't that stupid?
- Chidi?
Hello?
- Shh.
Spencer doesn't like loud voices.
Yeesh.
What happened, man?
Well, I was trying to teach him to play fetch, like I did with my puppy as a kid, but instead of retrieving the stick, he attacked my face with his razor-sharp talons.
Why don't you just ask Michael for a dog?
Because it was my mistake to not pick a puppy fast enough.
I made my bed, and now I'll bleed in it.
Let me do that, dummy.
Come here.
What if I talk to Michael for you?
That way you don't have to worry about feeling ungrateful, or whatever, and maybe you'll still get a puppy.
- Instead of - Ow.
Deep wounds.
- You'd do that?
- Of course.
It's the least I can do, considering everything you've done for me.
So you get it, right?
- Hey.
- What?
You liked him, he liked you.
You did nice things for each other.
Your lack of parental affection did not make you numb to love, blah blah blah.
"Blah blah blah"?
Why don't you want me to see this?
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.
It's just, the rest is not interesting.
Yeah, no, you're right.
"Not that interesting".
Just watching myself fall in love for the first time in fake heaven.
What else is on?
I am going to put this back in my ear, and you are going to show me how thoughtful and caring I am, or I'm gonna rip off your demon head and shove it up whatever's where your butt should be.
Roll it.
Oh, a lizard was a perfect choice, Eleanor.
- You both have combination skin.
- Thanks.
Hey, this is a weird question to ask.
I'll just throw it out there.
Can I ride your centaur?
I'm afraid T'Hania's quite particular about whom she allows to ride her.
I tried, and she gave me a withering stare.
Turns out centaurs are a bit tricky.
You didn't have like a stable full of horses growing up?
Oh, of course, but they just pulled our carriages, or performed in our horse ballets.
They weren't so what's the word?
-  - Judgmental.
With whom can I speak about acquiring new shoes?
You can't expect me to walk around in these flats all day, like some common glue factory, hobo horse.
Eleanor, you were looking for me?
Uh, yeah, so, Chidi chose an owl, because he froze up trying to decide between two puppies.
Is it possible for him to swap?
Of course.
This is the Good Place.
But he might want to hold off.
Tonight we're having a party where everyone gets to transform into their pets for a few minutes, as a treat.
Chidi can fly like an owl, and you can do whatever lizards do.
Tahani, would you host the party at your mansion?
Of course.
I'd love to.
Is that what you're going to wear?
What?
N no.
No.
Of course not.
Why?
Is it unflattering?
I I can change.
Guys?
I can't find my lizard.
He was just out there, like one second ago.
No big deal.
Janet can find it.
No, I can't risk it.
These pets are supposed to, like, bond to our souls forever.
If Michael finds out mine ran away, he could figure out I'm not the real Eleanor.
Just, um, go without me, and tell people that I'm hanging out with my lizard, because we are so meshed together, or, whatever circle of life crap like that.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Go enjoy flying.
I'll meet you there.
Come on, Bleek.
Lizard?
Lizard?
Where the fork are you?
Lizard!
Ugh!
Why didn't I name you?
- Hey.
-  - Why?
- Oh!
Oh, no!
Chidi!
Sorry I shoved you, man.
I've just been a little jumpy.
Hey, you didn't happen to see my lizard in the lake, when you were thrashing around down there?
No.
It was cold and dark and scary.
But don't worry, we'll find him.
Michael and Janet are busy transforming people, anyway, so they didn't even notice you weren't there.
Holy crap, you're supposed to be flying right now.
It's no big deal, I just decided I'd rather be helping you.
Than soaring through the air like an owl?
That's amazing.
You're amazing.
After that, you spent all your time together.
You studied philosophy together.
You even got Chidi hooked on popcorn shrimp.
Eventually, you became suspicious of me, and escaped to Mindy St. Claire's house on a train.
That was the first time you actually said it out loud.
I love you.
And you don't need to respond, 'cause I know you have trouble saying how you feel I love you too.
That's the story.
You're capable of human love.
Congrats.
- Can we go now?
- How did it end?
Like it always did, with me rebooting you.
There's there's no need to Show me, please.
All right.
Let's get this over with.
- So, listen guys - No, you listen.
We just went to Mindy St. Claire's, and when she wasn't trying to trick us into having a threesome, she filled us in on everything that you've been up to here.
Oh, yeah?
We know this is, like, the hundredth time you've tried to torture us, but this time it's different, because we're in love.
And love is stronger than anything you can throw at us.
No, it's not.
Love is stronger than anything I can throw at you?
I could throw an elephant at you.
You think a thrown elephant wouldn't crush you because of love?
She was speaking metaphorically.
Even metaphorically, it's lame.
It's okay.
No matter what he does, we will find each other, and we will help each other, because we're soul mates.
There's no such thing as soul mates, you dingus.
I made it up.
I put clowns in your house because you hate them.
I forced you to choose the lizard, and then I made that lizard run away.
I made it all up!
Don't you understand that?
This  That's why I didn't want to give you your memories back.
I didn't want you to see how cruel I used to be.
Plus, I wore a lot of French cuff shirts back then.
I thought it made me look classy.
It's it's it's all embarrassing.
But I'm different now, I promise.
I'll swear on a Bible like you humans do.
I could grab one right now.
It's the only book they have in the Sex Ed section.
I'm not mad at you.
I can't be mad at a demon for being evil.
I'm just sad, because I thought for a second I could love someone.
But really, it was just you manipulating me into thinking I loved someone.
So, I guess I was right.
I'm incapable of love.
Eh, that's no biggie.
Do you wanna get burgers?
Hang on, how did you draw that conclusion?
You just watched yourself fall in love with Chidi.
No, I didn't, I watched a puppeteer pull a bunch of strings to make us think we were in love.
You said it yourself, you made it all up.
Okay, yes.
I put you and Chidi in close proximity, because I needed you to drive each other crazy.
But I never intended for you to fall in love.
Once you made us bond, the romance was inevitable.
It's a basic reality show playbook.
Put a bunch of attractive young people in stressful situations, so they act like idiots and have sex with each other.
This is all just determinism.
What?
"Determinism is the theory that "we have no control over our own actions.
"Everything we do happens because of some external force, which exists outside of our control".
I didn't choose to fall in love with Chidi, because some all-knowing demon, you, brought us together and scripted our lives.
That's ridiculous.
I didn't make you kiss Chidi by that lake.
You kind of did.
You orchestrated the whole "pet day" thing, manipulated us into choosing specific animals, made my lizard run away, which led to Chidi coming to help me find it, which led to us kissing, which led to us falling in love.
None of that was my choice.
Everything in my life has been determined by my upbringing, my genetics, or or my environment.
And everything in my afterlife was determined by you.
There is no such thing as free will.
We're closing up soon, guys.
Yeah, can we just have 15 minutes?
We're kind of in the middle of something.
I'd take off if I were you.
The second we close, they use this place to shoot pornos.
Okay.
You want something to drink?
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
But whatever I choose will be the result of millions of biological, genetic, and societal factors that are entirely outside my control.
Iced tea.
Oh, that sounds good.
I'll have one too.
Okay.
You think you have no free will, because I scripted everything that happened, right?
All I have to do is prove that you made one choice that I couldn't anticipate.
Easy.
-  - Okay, here's a perfect example!
-  In the very first attempt - Dude.
Dude-dude-dude!
- What?
- Yelling You're you're yelling.
- Oh - Like, so loudly.
Sorry.
- Sorry.
- Yeah.
Watch this, it's from the very first attempt.
If anyone has any information - Oh, boy.
- About any of this Okay, easy.
I beg you, tell me.
Hey, I love you, man.
Michael.
The problem in the neighborhood is me.
You saw your friend in pain, and you decided to sacrifice yourself to help him.
That wasn't me pulling a string or manipulating you.
In fact, it was the last thing I wanted.
Ruined my whole plan.
- Free will.
- No, dude.
The only reason I cared enough about Chidi to do that, was because you forced us together, made me feel bad for causing him pain.
- Okay, yeah - Yeah.
But, no, you were constantly doing stuff I couldn't anticipate.
As a matter of fact, I complained to you once, right right to your face.
- I think it was reboot 444.
-  Now, is Chidi trapped in the purple space bubble?
Yes.
Is he in pain?
Almost certainly.
Will he ever get out?
No.
However Uh, yeah, uh wrong one.
Wrong one.
I mean, that's worth watching.
It's great.
But uh not not the one I was thinking.
-  - It's probably, uh, 445.
-  -    You.
In here.
Where am I?
Hell.
You're in Hell.
Can I ask you something?
Have I missed anything in that freaky little noodle of yours?
See I I've studied everything about your life.
I know your hopes, your fears, your psychology, your tendencies.
- - I know all your private shames, like that you don't wash your feet in the shower; your first concert was Barenaked Ladies; and you have frequent sex dreams about Sam the Eagle, from the Muppets.
Well, he's very authoritative, and I find that reassuring.
You keep making crazy choices I don't understand.
Am I missing something?
I'm sorry.
Can we rewind for a second?
Who are you?
Who is that guy?
Am I dead?
Is Sam the Eagle here?
No.
I tried to script your whole afterlife.
And I devised a 15 million-point plan to torture you.
You made choices I never saw coming.
I call that free will.
What if all your choices are predetermined?
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
What?
We don't know.
Maybe there's a mega-demon who built a torture chamber for demons, and this whole thing is just him torturing you.
And maybe all the mega-demons are just fulfilling a destiny laid out by a bunch of super intelligent tarantula-squids, who are torturing them, be   Why did you do that?
- Because I have free will.
-  And because you're being so annoying.
Uh.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry that he did that.
- Happens all the time.
-  Usually it's the younger woman doing it to the older guy, though.
Dude!
Not cool.
Disagree.
I think it's the coolest thing I've ever done.
Do you really not see what's happening here?
Do you want me to spell it out for you?
This is a defense mechanism, Eleanor.
You saw yourself fall in love with Chidi, and it freaked you out to see yourself be so vulnerable.
So, you're using determinism to convince yourself that those feelings were not real.
You know, you don't know me, man.
Yes, I do, I know everything about you, remember?
Including that nothing scares you more than vulnerability.
Whatever.
Who even cares?
I do.
Because if everything is determined, and we have no free will, then all the stuff we're doing to put more good into the world is pointless.
And I want to believe that it matters.
So if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna use my free will right now to go pick up our friends at the airport.
Worst possible use of free will, but I'm gonna do it anyway, because I care about them.
You might wanna head out too.
We're closing soon, and the second we do, they use this place to shoot porn.
First class was amazing.
They give you so many free presents.
A shaving kit, an eye mask oh, a vest.
At times like this, it's fun to remember that we're legally married.
That is fun.
Oh, I call window seat!
I'm sorry.
You were right.
I was scared about what it all meant, and I went back to one of my favorite moves, turn on the ol' Blame Hose.
"This is all you fault".
Apology accepted.
And I'm sorry I dumped iced tea on your head.
Are you kidding me?
You did exactly what you should do when you're friend is being annoying.
You snapped me out of it.
It also made me realize, in a weird way, we are the only truly free beings in the universe, because we actually know what's up with the afterlife.
And I think that means we need to be bold.
Take the Soul Squad to the next level somehow.
You're right.
We need to find someone who can serve as a as a blueprint for humanity, someone who's life is so great that we can use it as a model to get as many points for as many people as possible.
And I think I know that perfect person.
Rihanna.
Good call.
I don't know her personally, but I did see her in Vegas once, and her calf brushed up against my tongue.
I licked her leg.
I was kicked out.
It's not Rihanna.
It's it's someone way cooler.
Hey, everybody out of the car!
Grab your bags!
We're going to rural Canada!
- Is it ready?
- I guess.
We have no idea if it'll work.
Oh, I'm sure it's perfect.
- Give it a try, Shawn.
- Me?
I'm not going through that thing.
She is.
Ask Michael how many times he rebooted them.
- He's lying - Yeah, zip it, toots.
We're way past that.
Where am I?
How long was I in there?
You have missed a lot.
Now go through that makeshift portal.
See if you explode.
This might be gross.
Oh.
Am I on Earth?
Did you figure out a way to build an illegal door to Earth?
Yes.
That's exactly what I did.
- Well, we all helped.
- Shut up, Glenn.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1   La la la la la Did you ever lie and listen to the rain fall Did you ever own a homemade apple pie Did you ever watch a child while he was praying Just don't let the good life pass you by Did you ever hold the hand of starving  - Hello.
- Hello.
Hope we have the right house.
I'm looking for a Doug Forcett?
Well, I'm Doug Forcett.
How?
Oh, yes.
Yes, you are.
Sorry, um, I'm a reporter for the "Calgary Times Examiner".
My name is Michael Scoop.
This is my photographer, Janet Scoop.
- She's my sister with the scoops.
- Oh, boy.
Some people in town are saying you live a pretty interesting life out here.
Growing your own food completely off the grid?
We would love to do a human interest story about you for the paper.
What do you say?
Okay, well let me think.
Well, first off, I'm so flattered that you'd want to do a whole news story just about me.
That's so nice.
A heartfelt thanks to the whole Scoop family.
Can I ask is your newspaper printed on recycled paper?
Yes, no, very recycled.
The most.
Well, all right then.
Come on in.
Great, great.
Oh, hey, you know, before we forget.
Can Janet take a photo of you for the paper?
Oh.
Okay, can you look up a little and to the right?
Smile, but only with your mouth and not your eyes.
Perfect.
It was 1972.
My friend Randy and I ate some magic mushrooms.
Randy asked me, "what do you think happens when you die"?
And I saw with perfect clarity how the afterlife works.
Immediately I knew I had to live a perfect life.
Well, not immediately.
The next day all I could do was watch kung-fu movies and stroke a blanket that I thought was my cat.
But soon after, I designed a life that would maximize my point total and help me get into the Good Place.
And I've been living it ever since.
I know, this sounds crazy.
No!
No, actually it makes it makes perfect sense.
Oh.
Oh, boy.
You've been sitting here for ten minutes and I haven't offered you anything to eat or drink.
Would you like some water or fresh radishes?
Water would be great.
Janet, how cool is he?
You know, for a celebrity, he's amazingly down to earth.
Stars.
They really are just like us.
He's so thoughtful with his actions.
Thank goodness he had that hallucination.
He could have had the one Randy had where everything was made of ears.
Way less helpful.
We have to learn everything we can about what makes him tick so we can use it to help others.
He is the blueprint, Janet.
He figured it all out.
Here we go two waters.
Let me know if you're not happy with them.
I have ice cubes if it's too warm and a koozie if it's too cold.
Oh.
Well, that has an interesting aftertaste.
- Is that from a nearby river?
- Oh, no.
Why take fresh water away from the beavers and the fish?
No, I have my composting toilet hooked up to a water filtration system.
One man's waste is another man's water.
And both men are me.
Hmm.
Yeah, I'm pretty excited to relax and have a drink.
I mean, saving souls feels great, but Sydney to Budapest to Phoenix to Calgary I'm so jetlagged, I can't even regrender my chorf.
Don't even know what I was trying to say.
You need to get your blood flowing.
There's a pool table over there.
- Wanna play?
- Yeah, sure.
Why not.
Let's do it.
Tahani, can I ask your advice about something?
Is it about your grating speaking voice?
I'm so glad you finally brought it up.
Because, honestly, with a few elocution lessons No, I wanna ask you about Chidi.
What's wrong with my voice?
Nothing.
It's lovely.
Tell me about Chidi.
So, it must get lonely up here all by yourself without anyone to talk to.
Oh, I've got lots of friends.
There's this little guy, for example.
Yeah, it's a snail.
Hi, snail.
I don't name them in case they already have a name they prefer.
- Huh.
- So, this is an organic garden?
Yeah.
Everything I eat I grow myself.
The radish patch was actually here when I moved in.
I thought it'd be mean to dig it up.
Mean to the radishes?
I also grow lentils because they require very little water and have the smallest carbon footprint.
Huh.
All he consumes are lentils and radishes.
No, Janet.
He also consumes his own waste.
So, everything's fine.
How do you play pool again?
What are the rules?
That's one of the best things about pool, dawg.
There are no rules.
I am 100% sure there are.
Me and my friends play a special Jacksonville style of pool.
It's called "Special Jacksonville-style pool".
You hit whatever ball you want but you use your hands.
And: that's it.
Okay, your turn.
I got a thousand points.
Oh, that's the other rule.
You make up your own points.
I got five million points.
Damn, how'd you get so good at this so fast?
So, in this whole other timeline, Chidi and I said "I love you" to each other.
But he doesn't remember any of that happened, so I guess my question is, When is the right time to tell someone you were passionate lovers in an alternate timeline in the afterlife but he doesn't remember because technically none of that happened in this strand of the multi-verse?
- Ugh.
- You know what?
I'll just check with Yahoo answers.
- I'm sure someone's weighed in.
- Nope, nope.
I'm flattered you would seek my advice.
Though, I suppose, it makes sense.
I'm sure the one constant in all the reboots is that you and I are best friends.
Uh-huh.
Yep.
Mm-hmm.
Look, I don't think you would want Chidi to know what happened in the past unless you wanted it to happen again in the present.
You can't know how Chidi will react.
It may be painful but it's never a bad idea to tell someone how you feel.
Thanks, Tahani.
You give really good advice.
And you made a really hot centaur.
Sorry?
So, these are some of my 71 adopted dogs and wolves.
You've rescued every stray animal that's ever wandered onto your property?
Oh, yes, ma'am.
I've been mauled several times.
Oh, this little guy here might look innocent, but boy, he goes right for the squeaker if you know what I mean.
Oh, this is fun.
You get to meet Raymond.
- Hi, Raymond.
- Hi, dumdum.
Who are these two hosers?
Don't worry about Raymond.
He's just a local sociopath who comes by my house to take advantage of me.
Yeah, I got your laundry all folded and ready for you.
For whatever reason, this loser does whatever you tell him to do.
Watch.
Hey, give that guy your shoe.
- Would that make you happy?
- Very happy.
Now give him your shoe.
Well, that's okay, Doug, don't I don't need your shoe.
Please don't give me your shoe.
Well, then give me your shoe, or I'll be sad.
There you are.
Well, as long as he's happy.
See, if I make him happy, I get the points.
That's how the system works, remember?
Go get your shoe, idiot.
Be right back.
Ow.
Oh, that's a bleeder.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Michael, face facts.
Doug is not the blueprint of how to live a good life.
He's become a happiness pump.
What?
Remember from Chidi's lessons?
I remember the term happiness pump.
That's just mostly because Eleanor and Jason made a bunch of dirty jokes about it.
It's a criticism of utilitarianism.
A happiness pump is someone who is obsessed with maximizing the overall good at his or her expense.
Doug will do literally anything to make other people happy even if it makes him miserable.
Oh, I don't think he's miserable.
So, everyone happy and contented in here?
What's Oh, I volunteered to test cosmetics for a local company so they don't have to test on animals.
- It's fun!
- Huh.
For the animals who don't have to do it.
For me, it's like wearing a mask of fire.
Uh, what can I do for you now?
Would you like to move in, permanently?
Or would either of you like any more water - or one of my kidneys?
- You know what?
We have absolutely everything we need.
Thank you.
We're gonna head out now.
Okay, well, it was so nice to meet you, Janet, and you, Mark.
I mean Michael.
I called you Mark.
Your name is Michael.
No, no, that's okay.
Hey, hey.
Stay with me here, buddy.
No, no, no, no, this is very bad.
Forgetting someone's name that's definitely lost me some points.
Hey, you know, I've always secretly wished my name was Mark.
Lie.
That's a lie!
Now I'm accusing you of lying.
Now I'm yelling.
Why am I yelling?
I need to make this up.
I'm going to give you a really nice haircut.
- Was that - A snail?
Yeah that was a Oh, no, no, no, no.
I think he's still alive.
Do either of you know anything about snail first aid?
- No.
- Yes.
I mean, "no".
All right, Michael, I need you to find some scotch tape while I apply pressure.
Too much pressure.
I'm gonna need that tape!
Oh, What?
!
Jacksonville style, baby.
Thirty million points.
Nice one, homie.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Well, I either know exactly what I'm doing and it's something, or we're doing nothing and I'm winning.
Congrats.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Okay, a few days ago, Michael showed me something.
And I don't know exactly how to say this, but you and I are Bambadjan.
You know, I never thought about it before but yeah, we are kinda Bambadjan.
No, you jetlagged doof.
Bambadjan is the name of a demon from the Bad Place who is somehow right over there.
Come with me right now.
Okay, okay.
Hey guys, having fun?
Cool, cool, cool.
So, we need to get out of here immediately because this bar is full of demons.
Eleanor, just because these people are wearing cheap leather and stone washed denim, they're still part of the Queen's realm.
Calling them demons is a bit much.
No, no, no, no, actual demons.
Like, from the Bad Place.
Okay, Chidi and I are going to go out the side door.
You and Tahani go out the back.
Or we do this the old fashioned way.
How did you make that so fast?
Bortle  Hello, idiots.
Surprised to see me?
Right.
You don't remember.
I'm Sean.
You are very scared of me.
Now, where's Michael?
We are here to celebrate the life of Martin Luther Gandhi Tyler Moore, the snail.
I named him/her that posthumously because I imagine him/her to be the greatest and most talented snail ever to have lived.
Michael, would you care to say a few words?
Oh, you're serious.
Yes.
Um, okay.
Martin was a lot of things.
A snail, mostly.
But also a friend.
Martin taught us about life, about love, and about the limits of scotch tape.
Goodbye, Martin.
Happy, slimy trails, old friend.
I'm sorry, I've got to leave right away.
I've decided to make a donation to the Canadian Mollusk Association in Martin's honor.
Their office is in Edmonton, so it will take me about three weeks to walk there and back.
Take care.
Okay, look out little fellow.
Heads up.
- Here comes a shoe.
- Say, Doug, look.
Do you mind if we ask you just a few more questions?
What you're doing here how you're living your life just so wonderful.
But can I maybe give you just a little advice?
I know I should donate more blood.
I'll try, but the last time I went down there they said I was so anemic, they ended up giving me blood.
No, look, look.
Um I've been a reporter for a long time, Doug.
Met all sorts of people.
Traveled all over this crazy blue marble.
Meeting regular folks.
Every face tells a story, Doug.
Why, I'd say that those so-called regular folks often turn out to be not so regular after all.
- Michael.
- Sorry.
The point is, I have never met anyone so dedicated to making other people and snails happy.
If what you're saying is true about the afterlife, then you must have earned more than enough points by now.
So, loosen up, bud.
Have a little fun.
Eat something besides lentils.
- Like radishes?
- No, no, Doug.
Dammit.
Just have ice cream or chicken parm.
Live your life.
You know, travel.
Drink regular water that wasn't inside you.
Okay?
Just relax.
Thank you, Michael.
But no.
I can't do any of those things.
Why not?
Because I can't risk it.
There's an accountant out there somewhere measuring the value of everything I do.
What if I relax and do something that loses me just enough points to keep me out of the Good Place and I'm tortured for eternity?
No, I have to make every moment count.
It's the only rational way to live.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to walk to Edmonton to give $85 to a snail charity.
Why don't you just take us to the Bad Place already, dude?
Because I want to see the look on Michael's face when he realizes he failed.
I love seeing the look on people's faces.
It's the best part of my job.
Dude, Michael's not coming here.
Face it, man.
You are outmatched, because Michael and Janet are brilliant and savvy and they've been ten steps ahead of you this whole time.
We can sit here as long as you want.
But you will never, ever, ever, see Michael or Janet aga Yikes, that was rough.
Total bust.
Ah, Doug is a complete disaster.
And I drank his piss.
Hello, Michael.
See?
See the look on his face?
So great.
Hello, Sean.
Other demons.
What are y'all doing down here?
What do you think we're doing, you hemorrhoid?
We're ending this charade once and for all.
These four humans are the legal property of the Bad Place.
That's where we're taking them.
And you.
If you want them, you're gonna have to go through me.
That's the idea.
Well, it's a bad idea.
Oh, Michael.
When will you ever Screw this.
Let's fight!
Get somewhere safe, you guys.
Bad news.
I've been going to the gym, a lot.
Oh, no.
What is happening?
Let him go!
Let him go!
Let him go!
Twelve years of fencing.
En garde.
Obviously, I'd never do that in a competition.
That would be a three-tenths deduction.
No, no, watch out.
Watch out.
I've never marbleized a Janet before.
Jacksonville style, baby.
Two thousand points!
Thanks, Jason.
Janet.
Door.
Three hundred points best score ever!
-  -  Is it just me or is Janet a straight-up hottie right now?
How are you this close to being dragged to Hell and still horny?
I don't know.
And how did you know they were demons?
I can't tell you that now!
Screw it.
What am I waiting for?
We could die in the next 30 seconds.
So, Michael showed me a memory of our time in the Good Place and you and I were, like, a thing.
- And - Gotcha!
Not like a casual, "Hey, I found two loose pills "in the bottom of my tote, let's pop 'em and see what's good," kinda thing.
We were in love, and there's a real possibility that I'm in love with you again.
Here.
On this plane of existence.
Today.
Now.
In Canada during this brawl with demons.
Let's get her to the door.
No!
No!
Oh, cool.
When I'm even partway through the door to the afterlife, my powers come back.
They do?
They do.
Thanks for asking.
You're coming with me.
Hi, there.
- We did it!
- It was, um Well, no, yeah, no.
Of course of course Janet did it.
Yes, but I had the, uh Thank you, Janet.
How did you get down here?
We have the only key to the door to Earth.
- We built our own door.
- That's impossible.
That's impossible.
Ugh, you're such a dweeb.
Why can't you leave us alone?
You don't have enough nostrils to stuff with wasps?
I don't want just any wasp nostrils I want these wasp nostrils.
You're just delaying the inevitable, Michael.
The Bad Place is going to get all of them eventually.
These four, their loved ones, even your precious pee-pee king, Doug Forcett.
Now, why would you think that?
Just a hunch.
And do you know what else I had a hunch about?
- No.
-   I mean, why let the guy keep saying mean stuff, right?
I thought Doug Forcett was the blueprint for leading a good life?
He seems pretty confident that Doug is heading to the Bad Place.
For a while now, I have felt like there was something wrong with how the point system was evaluating humans.
At first I thought it was that the system didn't allow for the possibility that people could improve.
That's why I convinced the Judge to send you back to Earth so you could confront the ways you were living.
But now I'm worried that the problems with the system might be much more serious.
We need to gather some real evidence.
Uh, sorry, no, no Michael.
You're confused.
Evidence isn't a good thing that you want.
It's a bad thing that you have to destroy or you go to jail.
Jason, quick, I need that coaster over there behind the pillar.
You got it, boss.
I just needed a 30 second break.
- Yeah.
- What sort of evidence is this and how do we get it?
Janet and I have to go right to the source of the points themselves the Accountant's office.
The four of you stay here at Doug Forcett's house until I get back.
You're gonna need to feed all the dogs and the wolves, and if a teenager shows up on a dirt bike just do as he says.
He's very scary.
Michael, Michael, Michael.
I forgot what you asked me to get.
That's okay, bud.
Thanks anyway.
Look, we won't be long and you guys should be safe here.
Actually, scratch that.
We're all screwed because a bunch more demons just showed up.
There's too many of them.
What do we do?
I have an idea.
I think I can take you into my void.
Cool.
That sounds fun.
Let's go into a void.
Okay, let's go.
But, just to be clear I don't know if you'll survive in my void, but either way, all of you will definitely die on Earth when I do this, so look around and say goodbye.
Goodbye, Earth.
Wait, did you just say we're gonna di
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1  Wow!
Ho-ho!
Oh, Janet, you did it!
You brought us into your void.
If I had a heart, it would be pounding.
- Michael - You know, you'd think there'd be side effects, but I feel great.
How's the hair?
Is it still amazing?
Michael, there may have been some side effects for the humans.
Huh.
Dude, why are there so many Janets?
Anwhy do I sound like Janet?
You also look like Janet.
Do I?
Why?
What?
What is happening?
Oh, no, am I wearing a vest?
Ooh, Michael, help me!
This is going to be tricky.
How do we even tell them apart?
Oh!
Okay, that one's Jason.
I can't put the humans back in their own bodies, so I've done the next best, but still not that great, thing.
A high-neck sleeveless?
- I suppose this outfit will do?
-  Are you sure?
I mean, wearing a floral print to an infinite void at this time of the nothing?
So where are we exactly?
We're not on Earth, right?
That's correct, Chidi-Janet.
You're not.
Your real bodies dematerialized when you entered my void, and your essences reconstituted themselves in this form.
Cool, cool.
And when you say "void" Oh, I mean a sub-dimension outside of space and time at the nexus of consciousness and matter tethered to my essence.
Does that help?
It does not help.
It makes it way worse.
I just want to lie down.
Where is down?
I found it.
It's up here.
It's dope.
I have an idea.
-  - Sweet.
I call sofa.
Janet's void has a back door to the Janet warehouse in the Neutral Zone, which is right near Accounting.
You four will stay here while Actual Janet and I sneak through it and find the Head Accountant.
But, Michael, why can't we go with you?
Well, you just died, which means you're the first humans in history to not immediately go to the Good or Bad Place, which, in turn, makes you inter-dimensional fugitives.
So that's neat.
Also, the Judge is probably still pissed at me for, you know, breaking all the rules, and she might take it out on you.
Plus, the Bad Place is probably hunting for us, so, literally, the entire universe is against you.
Okay, but what's a fourth really good reason?
Jeez, just trying to lighten the mood tough void.
Now, Janet and I will pose as Good Place employees and sweet-talk the Accountant into showing us his books.
If I'm right, we will find proof that the Bad Place is tampering with the point system.
The Accountant will tell us what to do, and this will all be over.
We're almost at the end, guys.
Just stay here, keep Janet's heads on straight.
- Bye.
-   Is that a Good Janet or a Bad Janet?
That's a Neutral Janet.
She's sort of the black sheep of the Janet world.
Or blank sheep, I guess.
Ooh, I can throw shade now.
That's cool.
You've arrived at the Accounting Office.
All point calculations for actions taken on Earth are made here.
- End of conversation.
- My name is Michael.
I need to speak with the Head Accountant on official Good Place business.
I will inform the Head Accountant of your presence, and he either will or will not see you in a certain amount of time end of conversation.
Wow.
Good thing your void plan worked out, huh?
Believe in life after love?
Oh, having four humans in my void is weird.
This is nuts.
We're in a void in the body of a white lady.
- Not a lady.
- Not a lady, darling.
Well, we are white.
Let's all say white people things!
Billy Joel.
I found it on Etsy.
There was nowhere to park.
Did you refill the Brita?
I find this void quite calming, actually.
It's like, this time, the Xanax took me.
Oh, I have the worst stomachache.
Dude, relax.
Here, let me see if I can figure this out.
Oh, wow, Eleanor!
How'd you do that?
I don't know.
We're Janets now.
So I thought we'd have some bitchin' Janet powers.
What just happened?
What did you do?
Sorry, I'm just trying to help Chidi calm down The structural integrity of this void is already at risk.
You can't start randomly conjuring up objects, or it might shatter the void.
Yes, it might.
It might make everything blow up, and we'll all disappear forever.
Mwah.
So stop it!
Everything okay?
- Nope.
- Well The Head Accountant has decided to see you.
This will happen now.
End of conversation.
Hi.
Hey-o!
There they are.
Good to see you.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Neil, Head Accountant.
- You must be Janet and Michael?
- Yes.
Can I just say, I really depreciate you coming.
Huh?
A little bit of accounting humor.
- Ah.
- Yeah.
- So what can I do for you?
- Well, I'm concerned about certain anomalies in the point system.
I'm worried that, somehow, the Bad Place has been tampering.
Tampering?
No, no, no.
Quite impossible.
Laughable, really.
Janet, can you remind me to laugh at that later?
Your amusement has been scheduled.
End of conversation.
She's a lot of fun.
Could you just humor us, though?
Show us how the system works?
Uh, well, I suppose I could give you a quick tour.
We don't get a lot of visitors.
Follow me.
Eleanor, how'd you know I always wanted a dog like this?
Funny story, it's one of the things I saw in the alternate timeline, where we were soul mates on and off for 300 years.
Maybe we should talk about that?
Well, I suppose we can, but there's not that much to talk about.
The things you saw weren't part of my life, so they didn't happen to me.
What the hell are you talking about, man?
Of course it was you.
I saw it.
Well, it was a Chidi, sure, but it wasn't me Chidi.
This is a classic philosophical question.
The concept of the self, or who we are.
Philosophically speaking, there's the Chidi I am, who lived a certain life, and there's the Chidi you saw your soul mate or whatever, who had some entirely different life.
- They're not the same Chidis.
-  I'm so sorry.
Yeah, no, I get it.
Counterpoint that's the dumbest thing you've ever said, and you do not deserve a puppy!
I'm un-blooping your puppy!
-  -  -  - Things are getting cuter, and I want them to get less cute!
So this is the main feed.
Every action by every human on Earth is recorded and then sent here to be assigned a point value based on the absolute moral worth of that action.
For example, a couple in Osaka, Japan, just decided to have a destination wedding.
Negative 1,200 points.
Oh, and it's a destination theme wedding.
Negative 4,300.
The theme's "Lord of the Rings".
They're basically doomed.
Ah, here's one.
This means that someone has just done something which has never been done before.
"Richard Moore of Sugarland, Texas, "hollowed out an eggplant and filled it with hot sauce and nickels".
And amazingly, it's not a weird sex thing.
99% of all new human behaviors are weird sex things.
But not in this oh, no, it is a weird sex thing, yeah.
Well, then we zip that over to the relevant departments.
In this case, Anastasia in the Stuffed Vegetable Department.
We've got Hector over in American Coins, and my dear buddy, Matt, in Weird Sex Things.
I'm still waiting on a response to the request I filed for immediate suicide.
Request denied.
I love Matty.
He's hilarious.
So they now examine the action its use of resources, the intentions behind it, its effects on others.
Correct.
And you end up with this.
And here is why tampering is impossible because this score is then double-checked by 3 billion other accountants, all chosen at random, and if they all come to the same conclusion, which they always do, it makes this official.
Anyone who does this same action in the exact same way loses this many points.
When people die, their biographical history and final point totals are sent to the relevant destination.
This batch is going to the Bad Place.
Thank you, Doris.
The system is flawless, and tampering is quite impossible.
I see.
Could we look at one specific file, though, just to make sure?
Oh, who do you want to see Genghis Khan, Marie Antoinette?
Walt Disney's got some freaky stuff in his file.
Doug Forcett.
I don't get this, man.
Why wouldn't you want to know what our life was like?
You're not even a little bit curious what it was like to hit this?
I don't mean this this.
Although, frankly, I would also hit this this.
I don't want to see those memories because, philosophically speaking, they're none of my business.
They happened to someone else.
Let me explain.
-  - Take a seat.
Conceptions of the self.
Let's start with John Locke, who believed that personal identity was based on having a continued consciousness essentially, memory.
Memories are links in a chain that together form a single self.
If I can't remember what happened because it happened to a Chidi from another timeline, it's not a unified me.
Just because you don't remember doing something doesn't mean you didn't do it.
I have no idea how it happened, but there is definitely a tattoo on my butt that says "Jasom".
That leads us to Derek Parfit.
- It does?
- Parfit said even if I have memories from an earlier time, that doesn't necessarily mean it was me.
After all, if my brain was split in two and each half was put in a different person, which one is me?
All I know is that other Chidi doesn't exist anymore, and this one does.
So this must be the real Chidi.
And all I know is that you're just barfing Wikipedia all over everyone to avoid talking about your feelings.
Let's talk about David Hume.
Here we go, the Book of Dougs.
Let's have a look.
Doug Forbush, Doug Forcap Doug L. Forcett.
Hey, no peeking.
Accountants only.
Can you just tell me his total so far?
Looks like he's at 520,000 points.
- Well done, Doug.
- So that's that's good?
Oh, it's excellent.
Wait, he's 68 years old?
Oh, that's terrible.
He's screwed.
I knew it!
Doug has spent his entire life being nothing but good.
He once found a dollar on the ground, and he sent it to the Canadian government to help pay down their national debt.
And he isn't even close to getting in?
How can that be?
Look, mate, the points are indisputable.
They have been since the beginning.
"Og Gives His Rock to Grog".
First ever act of human altruism.
Og earned 10,000 points that day.
Of course, then Grog used that rock to beat Og's brains in and lost a million points.
The point is, the math is cold, objective, and airtight, and unless you can prove otherwise, I don't know how I can help you.
I just got 700 new Weird Sex Thing files in the last one second.
Oh, yeah, Burning Man just started.
Buckle up, Matty.
It's going to be a long week.
So, in essence, Hume thought that we don't truly have a self.
We're just a bundle of our ever-changing impressions.
Just admit it, man.
You're embarrassed you fell in love with an Arizona trash bag.
Eleanor, it's not personal.
Someone fell in love with you.
- It's just not me.
-  I told you not to conjure anything.
Sorry, I-I just swapped the living room for a classroom.
Not you, him.
- Jason, what is wrong with you?
- Sorry, Janet.
I didn't mean to conjure Pillboi.
I was just thinking about how much fun we used to have hanging out in his broken hot tub, and then he showed up, Yeah, I was just chilling, being nothing, and then all of a sudden, I was.
- Oh!
-  Good-bye, Pillboi.
Aw, dip.
I'm not again!
-  - Oh.
You need to hurry.
My molecular essence is fragmenting, and it's giving me the worst headache.
Okay, here's a question.
If Doug Forcett's not getting in, who is?
Let's look at one more file someone who who's gotten into the Good Place this year.
All right, why don't we look at No one.
No one got in.
- No one's gotten in for a year?
- Correct.
How about the last three years?
All right, uh, boo-doo-doo  Uh, no one.
When was the last time someone got in?
The last time someone got enough points to get into the Good Place was 521 years ago.
Michael, um Yo, homey.
You and Eleanor were fighting before, and I couldn't help but overhear.
Hey, if we hear with our ears, why is it called "butt overhearing"?
Bro, if you don't like her, you should just tell her.
It's not about whether I like Eleanor.
I got into philosophy to try to make sense of a world that almost never makes sense.
And that was before I learned that I died and then un-died and then re-died.
I just can't take one more thing.
It's too much.
I'm going to tell you a story.
Back in Jacksonville, there was this guy in my 80-person dance crew named Stank Toby.
Hang on.
It was a 60-person dance crew.
Um Oh, dip!
What are numbers?
You're not Jason-Janet.
You're Eleanor-Janet pretending to be Jason-Janet.
That is so wrong and so confusing!
What was I supposed to do, man?
You wouldn't talk to me.
This seemed like the only option.
Hi, Chidi, I'm Eleanor.
I'm Arizona shrimp horny.
That's not what I sound like, Jason.
- Get out of here.
- Oh, dip.
Look, you know what?
Just forget it.
What am I even doing?
I'm I'm chasing a dude who isn't into me.
I'm making myself vulnerable for no reason.
I don't even know who I am anymore!
Uh-oh.
This is new.
I'm so annoyed at myself.
Gah!
Stupid, Eleanor!
Stupid!
This whole thing sucks, you know?
Eleanor, you you're not The one thing I never wanted to do, ever, for any reason, was to follow some guy around like a lame puppy dog!
I mean, look at me.
I don't need to do that.
I can get any guy I want.
- Eleanor, just hang on.
- What, dude, what?
- What do you want?
- What is going on?
-  - Okay, well, this is bad.
Why are you staring at me?
Do I have a zit on my nose or something?
Your sense of self is crumbling, and it's taking the void down with it.
Great.
So I don't feel like myself for two seconds, and it breaks the universe?
How come nothing went wrong when Chidi freaked out about his identity for three hours?
Because freaking out about everything is my identity.
Not to brag.
I need you to hold it together.
Try to do something Eleanor-y.
Laugh at someone who falls down, or show up to an event under-dressed and get mad at everyone else somehow.
I'll be right back.
I know I asked you this before, but No, darling, this is not where the Mac and PC guys live.
Whoa!
Check out this dope flat-screen!
It's air-mounted!
Do you see this, Tahani?
This must be where Janet stores all her information.
This screen can literally show us anything that has ever happened.
Cartoons, cartoons!
I think it's broken.
TV, play cartoons for Jason!
Oh, my.
Janet has a crush on you.
I'm sorry.
It's not just a crush.
I think in one of the reboots, you and Janet were married.
Whoa, married?
Oh.
This flat-screen must have been a wedding present.
It's all starting to make sense now.
Well, I've got to run.
We're having a little thing in the break room for Marisol's birthday.
She turning 39,000,000 again.
So, if there's nothing else "If there's nothing else"?
Neil, be logical.
Not one Good Place resident in over 500 years?
Not Jonas Salk?
Not Harriet Tubman?
Not one single Golden Girl?
The Bad Place has hacked your system!
No, it hasn't.
How dare you?
Frankly, I'm beginning to resent your tone, sir.
If you've got a problem, then go to the Good Place and take it up with the Committee.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the break room, because there's cake over there, and if I don't move quickly, Erika will get the last corner piece.
Good day, sir!
No, no, no.
This can't be happening.
No, he was supposed to tell us what to do.
If he's not going to fix this, who is?
- You, Michael.
-  It has to be you.
We keep wandering around these different realms expecting someone else to have the answer, but no one ever does.
You're the guy, Michael.
You're the only one who can fix whatever's wrong with the afterlife.
But before we get into that, Eleanor's identity is shattering inside of my void, and I might blow up.
So I'm going to need you to grab a paper clip and marbleize me, like, yesterday.
What's going to happen to the humans?
No idea, but I can't take them out of my void in the middle of this office.
And if we do nothing, everyone's gone-zo.
Marbleize me, get us somewhere safe, and bring me back.
Right, a paper clip!
I need a paper clip!
Hey, Matt.
Do you have a paper clip?
What are you going to use it for?
- Chidi, I'm scared.
- I know.
What am I supposed to be doing right now?
I don't remember.
I'm having a hard time remembering.
Right.
Memories, you need to remember who you are.
You're Eleanor Shellstrop from Phoenix, Arizona.
Your favorite meal is shrimp scampi.
You listed your emergency contact as Britney Spears as a long-shot way of meeting her, and your favorite movie is that clip of John Travolta saying "Adele Dazeem".
You flew halfway around the world because you wanted to be a better person, and it was very brave.
You're sharp, and you're strong.
You make fun of me a lot.
You once called me a human snooze button.
but you also showed up in my classroom when I was drowning in despair and canned chili, and you basically saved my life.
You have very high self-esteem, and a very low tolerance for men who wear sandals, and your worst nightmare is someone saying something nice about you to your face, but too bad because I need to say it because you deserve it.
- Because because - Chidi    Nice work, bud.
Did you mean everything you said, or did you just say it because the world was ending?
I really want to play this cool, but I'm afraid that I'm going to ruin it if I try to be sexy.
I already ruined it.
Um, saying the word "sexy" is not sexy - Wait!
- Ooh!
I'm okay.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm okay.
- Wait.
Uh-oh.
Ooh.
- What?
They're not Janets anymore.
They're them, and they're not sitting well.
Incoming.
They're all here, and they're safe  From the old scary thing.
Now there's a new scary thing.
Hi, guys, I'm Neil.
Welcome to Accounting.
Now, it does seem that four of you are inter-dimensional fugitives, so I did go ahead and hit the alarm sorry about that.
But there is some good news.
- There's some cake left.
- Yes!
Michael, what are we going to do?
Guys, I'm so sorry.
- The Accountant was no help.
- Rude.
No one's gotten into the Good Place in 500 years.
We have no plan.
No one's coming to save us.
So I'm going to do it.
Follow me!
Corner piece!
No!
You can't take the Book of Dougs.
Accountants only.
I need one of you to volunteer to do something outrageously insane that will either make you cease to exist or be really fun.
That's most of the things I've tried.
That's my guy.
Come here, come here.
- Get in the tube.
- Oh, hell, yeah.
- I love getting in stuff.
-   No way to know what happened to him.
So, come on, let's go, everyone else.
Come on.
Here you go.
Ow!
That was awesome!
That was awesome!
I want to go again!
Where are we?
We're in the Good Place.
No offense, dude, but you have told us a lot of lies in the last 300 years.
So, seriously, where the fork are we?
Fork.
Shirt.
Ash hole.
Holy forking shirtballs.
We're in the Good Place!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 Holy forking shirtballs.
We're in the Good Place.
Are we sure we're in the actual Good Place?
It's rather carpeted.
Yeah, I don't see any go-karts, much less go-karts being driven by monkeys wearing sunglasses and Hawaiian shirts.
- What?
- Don't No, this is definitely some part of the Good Place.
Just take a deep breath.
Whoa.
That smells like Typhoon Falls, my favorite water park when I was a kid.
Mmm.
Chlorine, suntan lotion, Band-Aids, and a thick cloud of teen hormones.
When I was researching my fake Neighborhood, I learned about this.
The Good Place smells like whatever makes you happiest.
Warm pretzels.
Or, no, wait.
It's the smell of absolute moral truth?
Those two things have very similar smells.
I smell Blake Bortles holding the Super Bowl MVP trophy, as Dan Patrick says, "This has to feel good, Blake".
And he says, "It sure does, Dan, and I owe it all to my best friend, Jason Mendoza".
- Also, weed.
- Mmm.
To me it smells like a curtain closing between first class and economy.
Ah, this truly is the Good Place.
I don't think we're in the main Good Place area.
This seems like this is some kind of a mail depot.
So, we're talking about mailmen now, from heaven?
I literally had that calendar and I did not get past March.
- What?
- Don't.
Okay, there are two key things that we have to do.
Make sure that no one can follow us.
- Janet?
- On it.
What's the second thing we have to do?
- Keep a low profile.
-  Okay, if there's anyone in the building, here's our cover story.
I'm an account; you are a Neutral Janet.
And you four won a contest.
- Really?
- Really?
Okay, not that.
I'll come up with something better.
Why do we need a cover story at all?
There are the good guys.
Let's just come clean and request asylum.
Yeah, man, we're refugees.
What kind of messed-up place would turn away refugees?
The main thing I've learned about the Good Place is that they never break the rules.
No way to guarantee they wouldn't send you right down to the Bad Place.
What the heck is going on in there?
- Uh -  Oh, hi there.
Um, I'm I'm an accountant.
We're coming from Accounting, and as we were climbing through the the mailbox, it it blew up.
The explosion was caused by demons.
We were being chased by demons.
And a Dracula.
There was a Dracula chasing us.
- Was there, though, Jason?
- Yeah.
Maybe Drac blew up the mailbox with his bazooka.
Well, jeez Louise, I'm sure glad you're okay.
My name's Gwendolyn.
Welcome to the Good Place.
I'm Michael, and this is my Neutral Janet.
Hello, also, not hello.
It's nothing to meet you.
End of statement.
And these four here are humans, if you can believe it.
"If" I could believe it?
Watch this: I believe it.
Why are they here?
Because they won a contest.
Congratulations, guys.
Come on in.
This is the correspondence center.
Make yourselves at home.
There's a sofa, that's a bowl of fruit, that's the door to the Good Place.
Ooh, this is a fun paperweight shaped like a little hat.
I'm sorry, this right here is is the door to, um, the Good Place?
Well, it's a door to the Good Place, but it won't open for you guys, though.
The only door for humans is the Official Entrance, which is 500 trillion miles north-south-north of here.
So, you're kinda just stuck inside.
Wow, it's really weird that you guys won a contest to be in this building.
Well, you know, take that up with the folks at "Weird Contest Magazine".
Hey, why don't we help you clean up the mess in the mail room?
Wow, thanks.
Did I win a contest?
Chidi and I will be right there.
Chidi, help me.
- She said it's not gonna open.
- Fine.
Ooh!
- Eleanor.
- What?
This is how I always got out of escape rooms.
If you break enough stuff, they open the door and kick you out.
Is everything okay in there?
Yep.
Okay.
No follow-up questions.
Hey there, Smashy, before you start grabbing any other throwing lamps, you have anything - you need to talk about?
- I can't take this anymore, man all the running and the hiding and fighting and this whole insane journey.
And now all that stands between us and the actual Good Place is one door?
What is that two inches thick?
That's like four Oreos.
We're four Oreos from heaven.
I know.
I know.
It's an insane situation, but I am right here with you.
So, let's take a deep breath.
Mmm.
Okay, the smell of the barf from the wave pool is really helping.
How?
Why?
- Say, Gwendolyn.
- Hmm?
I need to speak with the committee regarding an urgent matter.
Oh, sorry, you'd have to contact them directly, and that's definitely against the rules.
I see.
How would I contact them, though, if it weren't against the rules?
Well, by calling them on that phone, but I can't let you use it.
Right, and even if it weren't against the rules, I don't know the number, and you wouldn't tell me.
I couldn't.
There are no numbers.
You pick it up and it connects you to whomever you want, but you can't use it.
Of course not.
- Just as a hypothetical - Mm-hmm.
Is there any way that you would know if I did use the phone?
- Any kind of alarm?
- Golly, no.
So, it's entirely untraceable?
Sure is.
What a fun thought experiment.
- You said it, Gwendolyn.
- Uh-huh.
Say, is that a dog barking in another room?
I doubt it, because I don't have a dog.
But out of politeness and an abundance of caution, I'll go check.
Hello, doggy.
My name is Michael, I'm an Accountant.
I need to speak with the Committee immediately, on the top floor of the Correspondence Center.
Thank you.
Jason, you seem thoughtful and that concerns me.
Do you remember that one time when we were in Janet's void, and we all looked like Janet?
I do, yes.
You know how I saw that thing about how Janet loves me?
I don't know how I feel about her, and also, I feel bad that I sort of, like, read her diary.
And she doesn't know.
What should I do?
Well, perhaps, you should tell Janet what you saw, and start a dialogue about your feelings.
Who knows if a relationship will take hold, but you must begin from a place of honesty.
Thanks, Tahani.
It's nice to know I can talk about girls with my wife.
Hey, Janet.
Uh, so, do you remember how you killed us and brought us into your void?
I do, yes.
When we were in there, I was wandering around, because you have the ability to make anything, and I wanted to see where you keep the roller blades.
And I accidentally saw that video thing about how you love me.
You saw that?
That's so embarrassing.
I mean, it kind of freaked me out at first.
But, hey, let's talk about it.
I don't want to talk about this.
You guys were in my void, and it was exhausting, and I almost blew up, and I have to be neutral, and Neutral Janets don't have feelings How's it going in here?
It is going neutrally.
End of conversation.
- Can can we - End of conversation.
You got one shot, buddy.
Be clear, be confident, and don't let them intimidate you.
Oh, wow.
- Wow.
- This is place is very cool.
Have you guys ever been here before?
- I have never been here before.
- No, no, no.
- I love it, so charming.
- Really great, it's earthy.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Michael.
Thank you for coming.
No, thank you for asking us to come.
It is one of the great honors of my eternal life to be invited here by you, today, for this momentous occasion.
Now, who are you, and why are we here?
Well, in a nutshell, I believe that the Bad Place has somehow infiltrated the Accounting Department, and it's tampering with the points system.
My goodness, that would be a disaster.
Everyone focus up.
Meg, you take notes.
Daisuke, open a secure channel to headquarters.
Kellen, head to the farmer's market and grab us fresh peaches.
I think pluots are in season.
Then get pluots, Kellen.
Get as many pluots as can fit in your tote bag.
We're gonna be here a while.
Brought you some water.
Well, I mean, there's not a kitchen, but I found this kind of glowing bowl with liquid in it?
Maybe it was a toilet.
I'm gonna throw this out.
What are you doing?
Trying to jimmy the lock, but everything I stick in here just turns to glitter.
- Ugh.
- All right, forget about the door.
Look at me.
Right now, we're together in heaven basically.
And we're in love.
Compared to some of the other stuff that's happened to us, it could be worse.
I guess "try and enjoy this" is a better plan than "have the anxiety sweats".
Oh, check it out straight through my sweatshirt.
Cool.
Hey.
I have an idea to take your mind off the door.
Let's go on a date.
- What?
- No, I'm serious.
Why not have our first date four Oreos away from paradise?
You still wanna go out with me after I just showed you my anxiety sweats?
Man, you must really be into me.
You have to admit, it's very odd that no one has gotten into the Good Place for 500 years.
Well, there've been dips before.
Remember like, 200,000 years ago, when they invented stabbing, and they were all just, like, stabbing each other?
Again, I urge you to look at Doug Forcett.
The man has lived a selfless life, and he's not even close to getting in.
The only explanation is that the Bad Place has somehow rigged the system.
I wouldn't put it past them.
Every single Bad Place employee is a disgusting monster.
Well, some of 'em are probably cool, handsome, man-about-town types.
Committee, Michael the Accountant has brought us evidence of a problem, and now it is up to us to find a solution.
While you wait, Kellen will stand by you, showering you with compliments.
Great job, Michael.
You are such a good speaker.
This suit is very flattering.
You have a lot of gravitas.
I thought I was gonna be annoyed by this, but it's it's wonderful.
Your jawline is extraordinary.
You're a nice height.
Your energy is electric.
I gotta say, it's been really nice having a little company.
It's nice to be here.
And it's not nice to not be there.
So, how'd you two meet?
Was it through the contest?
Tahani and I met in brain school, and then we got married, because nothing mattered.
You're both so attractive.
Are all humans as attractive as you two?
No.
Fantastic.
Say, Jason, can you help me get more wicker baskets - from the other room?
- Sure thing.
I'm so sorry, darling, this is all my fault.
I encouraged Jason to come clean about what we saw.
You saw that too?
- No.
-  Jason knows that I love him, it stinks to hear about how the two of you are married, this beige outfit really washes out my not-skin, and if I don't remain neutral in front of Gwendolyn, she's gonna know we've been lying.
All of these new emotions I'm feeling are about to burst out of me, which might be super embarrassing.
What if they come out my butt?
Whoa, champagne.
Found it in the cupboard.
I think it was a gift.
I feel kind of bad, what if it was for something really important?
"Gwendolyn: Here's some champagne for you "for thanking me for thanking you "for thanking me for thanking you for thanking me for the champagne you sent me".
Pop that bench.
This is my kind of scrappy fun, sneaking around with a boy, trying not to get caught.
I know, it's like when my parents would go to a symposium and I would sneak into their office and read the unabridged dictionary.
I can't believe I'm attracted to you.
You are, though.
I'm not worried about that anymore.
You blew it when you admitted it to me.
You still thinking about what's on the other side of that door?
Not really, no.
Because you're here with me on this side.
I have one more little surprise for you.
Okay, open 'em.
Holy forking fork.
What do you think?
Oh, no, you're crying.
I assume it's because you're happy or horny.
Is this a horny cry?
No, I'm crying because I'm miserable, and it's all your fault.
Why?
Do you not like the outfit?
I love the outfit.
You look amazing.
And this sucks, and I'm furious, and I'm the happiest I've ever been, and I blame you.
In light of this new information, the time has come to take decisive action.
Wow, can't tell you how happy I am to hear you say that.
We are gonna form an elite investigative team to get to the bottom of this.
And we are fast-tracking the process.
It'll take no more than 400 years.
Sorry?
It's aggressive, but you heard right.
We are only giving ourselves 400 years to select the members of this elite team.
Wait, 400 years just to form the team?
I was thinking that we could do something now-ish.
Like, right now.
Michael, we have rules, procedures.
We're the good guys.
We can't just do stuff.
No.
Upon formation, the team will then be in charge of organizing a Blue Ribbon Commission to investigate themselves, to make sure there's no conflicts of interest.
And that will take 1,000 years.
Okay.
Just so you know, the whole time you're doing this, the bad guys are continuing to torture everyone who ends up in the Bad Place, which is everyone.
And that deeply concerns us.
Have you seen the memoranda we've sent each other about how concerned we are?
We're taking this very seriously.
Hear, hear.
Kellan, did you file a "Hear, Hear" memorandum?
No.
Sincerest apologies.
I rescind my "Hear, hear" and resign, effective immediately.
Hey, you two.
I think I may have solved one part of our little problem.
I made up a "Death Did Us Part" certificate, explaining that since Jason and I are dead, we are officially no longer fake-married.
I know it's not your main concern, but whatever part of you was vexed by our silly arrangement, you can now both relax.
I can tell by your silence and inability to make eye contact with me that I've knocked it out of the park.
It's a nice gesture.
I feel both pitied and put on the spot, so that's fun.
And it's a cool reminder of how I'm dead.
Well, forget it.
Never mind.
Misfire.
Watch this.
There, cancelled.
So, you and I are married again?
No, we we're not.
Um Bleh.
- It's okay.
-  Cry as long as you want.
I'm going to.
'Cause my tears taste like the nacho cheese from my favorite movie theater.
That's a really weird incentive to keep crying.
Relationships are stupid.
You're scared you're never gonna have a real one, and then when you do, you're scared it's gonna go away.
Here's an idea, what if we don't worry about whatever comes next?
There's a quote a I like by Tolstoy: "There is only one time that is important: Now.
"It is the only time  "When we have any power".
I know that quote.
An unverified Tyra Banks account posted that meme on Instagram.
Well, now I hate it.
There is another quote first spoken by a very wise, very attractive, occasionally very sweaty philosopher: "You gotta try".
Now, she was talking about making the world a better place, but I think it applies to relationships too.
I've got an idea of something we could try.
Great.
What?
Oh.
Wait, I I think I know Well, I don't wanna assume.
What if we both write down what we think you mean What if we didn't?
Ooh ah.
Michael?
How did it go?
Is the Committee going to help us?
The Committee's a bunch of ineffectual dorks in fleece vests.
The Titanic is sinking, and they're writing a strongly-worded letter to the iceberg.
How much more evidence do they need?
The Bad Place has to be tampering with the system.
There's no other explanation.
Can I ask you an unrelated question?
Absolutely not.
The fate of all of humanity is at stake, and time is running out.
Go ahead.
I'm trying to help Jason and Janet navigate some very complex feelings, but everything I do makes it worse.
You know them better than anyone else.
How do I just make them happy?
How do you make Jason happy?
You give him a lollipop shaped like a Transformer.
You'd think it'd be that simple.
But every time I do something nice, it backfires.
There are so many unintended consequences to well-intentioned actions.
Feels like a game you can't win.
That's it.
There is another explanation: unintended consequences.
Oh, Tahani, you did it.
Well, of course I did, darling.
Did what?
All along, I've only been looking at one Doug, but there's millions of Dougs in here.
In 1534, Douglass Wynegar of Hawkhurst, England, gave his grandmother roses for her birthday.
He picked them himself, walked them over to her, she was happy boom, 145 points.
-  - Now Yeah, here we go.
In 2009, Doug Ewing of Scaggsville, Maryland, also gave his grandmother a dozen roses, but he lost four points.
Why?
Because he ordered roses using a cell phone that was made in a sweatshop.
The flowers were grown with toxic pesticides, picked by exploited migrant workers, delivered from thousands of miles away, which created a massive carbon footprint, and his money went to a billionaire racist CEO who sends his female employees pictures of his genitals.
Whoo!
That is a very odd thing to cheer.
Don't you understand?
The Bad Place isn't tampering with points; they don't have to.
Because every day the world gets a little more complicated, and being a good person gets a little harder.
Gather the others.
We have a lot to do.
But we didn't really deal with my thing Okay, I'll just figure it out.
Janet, I owe you an apology.
I'm very sorry I meddled.
Truly, I was only trying to help, because I want you two to be happy.
And because, well, I love you.
I really do.
I love you both.
-  - Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong again?
No, I'm just crying because you're such a nice and thoughtful friend.
And the emotions aren't coming out of my butt, they're coming out of my eyes, which is somehow just as embarrassing.
- Why are you crying?
- I don't know.
I'm British, I I never cry.
But you're saying these nice things about me, and it's making me cry.
And also, this is less important, but the carpeting is really disgusting.
Why are you crying?
I just like being a part of things.
Two humans and a Neutral Janet crying?
In the Good Place?
I've never been suspicious of anyone, but I think that's about to change.
Oh, no reason to be suspicious, I promise you, we've done nothing untoward.
What's up, fart-faces?
Chidi and I just had sex in a closet.
Michael, have you all been lying to me this whole time?
That upsets me!
I'm gonna try to shake my fist at you.
D'oh!
Gosh darn it.
I have no choice, I have to turn you in to the Judge.
Don't bother, I already did.
Hey, Frogman.
The Judge agreed to your terms.
She'll meet you at IHOP.
So, this is the Good Place, huh?
Smells like frogs.
Cool.
Let's go.
Sorry, did he just say we're going to IHOP?
- Yes.
- Tight.
No, not tight.
The Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes is the most dangerous place in the universe.
Then why are we going?
- To save humanity.
- Great.
Any chance I could change real quick?
- Nope.
- Cool.
Bye, guys.
Nice to meet you.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
1 So you're telling me I can't get any pancakes at this IHOP?
It's not the place you're thinking of.
This is the Inter-dimensional Hole of Pancakes.
It's the crossroads of all dimensions like Grand Central Station but for space and time.
If you eat anything in this IHOP, you will literally explode.
Yeah, I know.
It's IHOP.
Why are we meeting there?
The Judge's powers are limited in the IHOP, so she can't just retire me on the spot.
And I believe that when she hears what I've discovered about the points system, she'll take our side.
If not, then we'll jump through a portal to another dimension, hope our molecules don't liquefy, and regroup from there.
Excuse me.
Okay.
Now watch your step.
Hey, so Yeah, so I don't want to go in there.
I get that.
Come here.
Here are your options.
Option number one  Cruel but necessary.
Oh, look at this.
They added a tenth dimension.
-  -  Boy.
Permits must have been a headache.
It looks like we're inside a Diane Von Furstenburg pattern from spring 2013!
Okay, everyone, just be cool.
I know exactly what's going on.
We all smoked too much salvia.
We got to ride this out for about two, three minutes, and then we'll be back in Pillboi's broken hot tub, and this will all be over.
Hey, is is this a good time to talk?
Well, there's no time like the present.
And here there's neither "no time" nor "the present".
Go ahead.
So you know how me and you used to be married when I was dead before?
Mm-hmm.
I think I'm starting to catch feelings again for you.
Mm-hmm.
And if I don't double-die in this IHOP and the Judge lady doesn't turn you into a marble do you want to try being boyfriend-girlfriend?
I'm not a girl.
But, yes, I'd very much like to go on a date with you somewhere sometime, as opposed to here, which is nowhere at all the times.
-  - You get it?
Yeah.
Hey!
Butthead!
You lie to my face, disrespect my orders, steal the only key to Earth, meddle with an already compromised timeline, kidnap the humans into a Janets' void, and now demand a meeting in the freakin' IHOP?
I hate this place!
I wouldn't have asked for a meet if it weren't vitally important.
And I promise, no more rule-breaking.
Oh, yeah, really?
Cool.
'Cause it kind of looks like you stole a book from Accounting!
No more rule-breaking starting now.
Ugh.
Hello, Chidi.
That is a great look for you.
If things don't work out here with old Blondie, you know who to call this bitch.
Sorry.
What is on me right now?
Oops.
Where'd you come from, little buddy?
No, don't touch it!
Tahani, do not touch the Neednoggle.
- What?
- Bad.
This is all bad.
Humans are such whiners.
Here, hot pants, let me take care of it for you.
Help.
Ah.
Ah.
Everybody, you're all still standing in the IHOP.
The Judge simply augmented your reality to make you feel like you're in a normal IHOP.
Very smart.
Don't suck up to me, you suck-up.
This is far better.
Instead of a slug creature, I have a cute little scarf.
- No!
No!
- No, no, no!
Don't touch it!
Tahani, that's still the Neednoggle.
The Judge just made it look like a scarf.
- Wonderful.
- All right.
Why don't we all sit down so I can fill the Judge in on what we've learned?
Your Honor, I once stood in front of you and said I thought there was something wrong with the points system.
I finally know what it is.
Life now is so complicated, it's impossible for anyone to be good enough for the Good Place.
I know you don't like to learn too much about life on Earth to remain impartial, but these days just buying a tomato at a grocery store means that you are unwittingly supporting toxic pesticides, exploiting labor, contributing to global warming.
Humans think that they're making one choice, but they're actually making dozens of choices they don't even know they're making.
Your big revelation is life is complicated?
That's not a revelation.
That's a divorced woman's throw pillow.
I mean, this guy chose this tomato.
Those are the consequences.
You don't want the consequences?
Do the research.
Buy another tomato.
What else you got?
Um I'll tell you what else I got, uh I got this.
Michael.
What what are you doing?
The Backpack Kid dance.
- Why?
- I don't know.
It makes people happy.
Is it helping?
Can I say something?
Jean-Paul Sartre once wrote Boring!
I got this.
I want to tell you about a guy from my dance crew in Jacksonville called Big Noodle.
Well, we gave it our best shot, guys.
It was nice knowing you.
I used to yell at Big Noodle 'cause he always showed up late to rehearsal.
Then one day, the swamp under my house flooded.
I needed a place to crash, so I slept at Big Noodle's house.
Turns out that he had to juggle three jobs to take care of four grandparents who all lived in the same bed just like in "Willy Wonka".
I never yelled at Big Noodle for being late after that 'cause I knew how hard it was for him to be there.
And he definitely didn't have time to research what tomatoes to buy.
Even if he wanted to, possession of a non-fried vegetable is a felony in Jacksonville.
The point is, you can't judge humans 'cause you don't know what we go through.
Amazingly, Your Honor, he's right.
I didn't really understand people until I went to Earth.
Maybe you should give it a shot.
If you still don't see things our way, then we'll drop it, and you can you know, zappy, zappy, marble, marble.
Yeah, sure.
I'll give it a shot.
I'll go down there.
See what you guys go through.
And then one way or another, this is going to end.
Hey, do you guys know a good place where I can get Mexican food?
Oh  Mexico.
Duh.
- Whoa.
-  How long will she be gone?
No way to tell.
Uh, my guess is Oh, brother.
That was rough.
- Right?
- Sheesh.
Earth is a mess, y'all.
Woof!
Also, I guess I'm black?
And they do not like black ladies down there.
Crap, y'all.
This is bad.
Where did you go, exactly?
Tanzania, Paraguay, Vietnam, Denmark.
It's terrible everywhere and always in a different way.
The only place I liked was Hawaii, although I barely left the resort.
The last place I went was a Black Friday sale at an outlet mall in Michigan.
- Why?
- For the deals.
Earth stinks, y'all.
It's hot, and it's crowded but somehow also cold and lonely.
I thought it was going to be so easy to make good decisions.
The first thing I did was I Googled "big, juicy natural tomatoes," which led me to a porn site that was for people with a sunburn fetish or I kind of never recovered.
Right.
That's problem number one.
Life is chaotic and messy and unpredictable.
Problem number two even if you do somehow manage to make good decisions, you still lose points because of the unintended consequences.
Yeah, there are booby traps everywhere.
Like, there's this chicken sandwich that if you eat it, it means you hate gay people.
And it's delicious.
It is.
It is so good.
And I essentially tried to do what you suggested.
I obsessed over every choice.
But that was also bad, and I still got sent to the Bad Place.
So I'm problem number three.
Oh, no, you are nobody's problem, sweetheart.
You know, we got to figure this out.
And then Turtle makes a bet with Ronda Rousey, and if she loses, she has to Oh, come on.
I was just in the middle of torturing William Shakespeare by describing the plot to the "Entourage" movie.
What is this?
Some new information has come to my attention, and I need a solution.
I want the Bad Place to weigh in on this.
But first, let's have a change of scenery.
Remember, guys, we're still in the IHOP, so be careful.
Shawn, I have reason to believe that humans might be, on average, better than the points system suggests they are.
Counterpoint humans are terrible Limp Bizkit, slavery.
The prosecution rests.
Got to say, that's a solid rebuttal.
Look, there are plenty of awful people and thoughtless jerks, and, I guess Nazis again, somehow.
But there are also people who are really trying to be good, and they aren't getting close.
Because they're not good at being good because they're bad.
The score they got on Earth is how good or bad they are full stop, end of story.
Then why did these four get better over and over again in my Neighborhood?
Why did they help each other in ways they had never helped anyone on Earth?
I don't know.
Maybe it's a fluke.
Plus, you have zero proof they did get better.
You didn't keep track of their points.
That's it.
I know what we have to Aah!
Oh.
He forgot we're still in the IHOP.
Anybody got eyes on Chidi?
Help!
Help!
Can someone grab my tiny boyfriend, please?
I'm on it.
And got him.
Ah.
Here you go.
Ah!
Ha!
I I just saw a trillion different realities folding onto each other like thin sheets of metal, forming a single blade.
Yeah, yeah, the Time-Knife.
We've all seen it.
- Let's get back on track, bud.
- Oh, okay, sure.
What I was saying, um, before, you know I saw the Time-Knife?
Is this Michael is right.
His Neighborhood gave us the chance to become better people because it removed all the variables that make life on Earth hard.
Yeah, uh, there was no rent to pay, no racism, no sexism.
No awards-show gift-suite publicist infighting.
What?
Those gift suites can be a real minefield.
But Shawn is also right.
The four of us becoming better people could be a fluke.
So let's repeat the experiment.
It's what Simone taught us about data collection.
Try it again and see if you get the same results.
Of course!
I build a new Neighborhood.
We choose four new people, tell them they're in the Good Place, create challenges for them, track their progress.
My guess is they will do what the original four did.
Seek help, support each other, make wise decisions, improve.
If they do, then it's proof that humans are not "bad, full stop, end of story".
This is so stupid.
Where would you even put this Neighborhood?
I wouldn't allow it to be built in the Good Place, that's for sure.
And I doubt you'd want to come back - to my neck of the woods.
- Ooh.
I have an idea.
Hi, Mindy.
We need to use your backyard.
You need my backyard?
For what?
We're conducting an important experiment Okay, you know what?
I don't care.
In fact, as soon as I started asking the question, I thought to myself, "Why are you asking this?
You don't care about the answer".
Do whatever you want.
Just leave me out of it.
And if you want to talk to someone, talk to Derek.
I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.
Who's Derek?
Don't think of Derek as my ex-boyfriend.
I made him, so he's more like my son.
Although I did make him because I was jealous of you and Tahani, so he's kind of my rebound booty call.
So he's your son-rebound-booty-call.
Fine, if you want to put labels on it, I guess he's my son-rebound-booty-call.
But he doesn't mean anything to me.
Also, Derek never really worked right.
He's a buffoon.
You have nothing to worry about.
"How should he love thee?
"Or how deem thee wise Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering"?
Oh.
I didn't see you there.
I was just reciting some Edgar Allan Poe.
Hi.
I'm Derek.
Welcome to the Medium Place.
Derek, why are you so different?
You have Mindy to thank for that.
See, she found a plunger sticking out of the ground behind our house, and every time she hits it, I pass out.
When I come to, I'm a little bit smarter and a little bit better.
Not to brag, but I almost have a full-grown penis now.
It's resplendent and mostly functional.
How many times has Mindy rebooted you?
I don't know.
Half a million.
- What?
- She reboots me a lot.
Sometimes when she's bored or just needs some "alone time".
Sometimes just for laughs.
Derek.
- Shall we head inside?
- Okay.
Cool.
So here are the rules.
Michael designs the new Neighborhood however he wants.
The Bad Place gets to choose the four new humans.
But they have to be the same general level of badness as the original four, all right?
No serial killers, no dictators, no one who managed a boy band.
Michael will not get the files in advance, so he does not have forever to plan.
But he can then change the Neighborhood however he wants.
Yeah, I have about a billion objections to this.
- So do I. - Good.
That means it's a fair compromise.
So one last issue where do we get all the other residents for this place?
Well, my original Neighborhood was built for torture, so everyone was a demon.
We can't have that.
I say we get them from the Good Place.
Over my dead skin suit.
Well, what other option do we have?
Would anybody like a Medium snack?
I myself will be enjoying another classy martini.
Don't mind if I do.
I can make the people.
Just like I made Derek.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
If the Judge restores my powers in the Medium Place, I can do it.
They'll be way more advanced than the original Derek.
- No offense.
- None taken.
Okay, the other residents will be comprised of Janet babies.
You will have one year of Earth time to try to improve the humans.
I will be monitoring everything to ensure there's no cheating and to track the humans' progress.
Deal?
-  -  - Ow!
-  - Classic.
- Ha ha!
-  - Ow!
- Janet?
- Hi, there.
- Ah.
- Ready to start building?
- Yes.
- I have some ideas for how to design a sort of basic Neighborhood, which we can then tailor to the guests as we learn more about them.
Now, when you say, um, some ideas - I have 11 trillion ideas.
- Yes.
I'm so glad you're here, Janet.
- Me too.
- All right, so  What's your first basic idea?
Perfect.
So basic.
This house was built to torture you.
Why did you have Michael re-create it exactly?
Well, in the memories I watched, this was where we fell in love.
So I figured, why mess with success?
I mean, blegh, what am I saying?
This house is stupid.
And you're lame, and I hate you.
I love you, too.
This is gonna be fun.
I mean, I know we have to help these new people, but most of the time, we'll just get to live together like a normal couple.
We can chill out and just relax - and study philosophy - Have sex.
Horndog.
Nerd!
Hi, I'm Daphne.
Hi, Daphne, I'm Janet.
I made you.
Great.
I'll wait for your instructions.
Thank you for making me.
Bye.
Okay, Daphne's done.
Only another 185 people to go.
I'll check back in an hour.
- You're doing so good, Janet.
- Thanks, Jason.
- Making people is exhausting.
-  Can't help but notice you're making a bunch of people.
You know, if we pooled our resources, we could be done in two shakes of a lamb's Derek.
Whatever.
Janet doesn't need your help, dude.
Actually, it would go a lot faster.
- Thanks, Derek.
- No problem.
-  - Don't worry.
This is purely professional, okay?
Now, be a pal and hold my classy martini while I get down to business.
Let's make people.
Hello, Your Honor.
You fell for it.
It's me, Shawn.
Just wanted to wish you bad luck.
Trying to psyche me out?
You must be scared.
Oh, I'm very confident.
I think we've picked some excellent subjects for your stupid experiment.
When you fail, and you will, I've got something special cooked up for your four little friends.
Let me guess, they're gonna be tortured with penis-flatteners and bees with teeth.
You are so predictable.
Why don't you at least switch it up once in a while?
Try using teeth-flatteners and bees with penises.
First of all, that's stupid.
But also, we are switching it up.
When you fail, the four humans will be tortured for all eternity.
But guess who's going to be doing the torturing?
Hello, idiot.
We built a Michael suit.
The boys down in R&D said it couldn't be done.
So I made it out of them.
That's Vicky in there right now, taking you for a spin.
You are disgusting.
- Disgusting-ah.
- Oh, Michael.
It's going to be so amazing watching your four BFFs look so sad and betrayed and confused as you, their reformed demon-daddy, unleash a swarm of penis bees.
I invented those.
That was me.
Well, I will just tell them what you're going to do, and they'll know that it isn't really me.
And we'll erase their memories of you telling them.
Thanks for inventing that little trick, by the way.
Very useful.
Have fun, Michael.
Enjoy everything that is about to overwhelm you.
Mm, bye, bitch!
So how bad is contestant number one?
Murderer?
War criminal?
Instagram DJ?
Uh, yeah, um - Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.
Yep.
Just a little jittery.
Last time I designed a Neighborhood, things didn't really go according to plan.
Eh, plans are for wimps.
We should have done this Shellstrop-style don't prepare at all, get drunk the morning of the test, BS our way through it, and then brag about how we didn't even study an still got a C-plus.
-  - So what do we got, man?
I got to go give everyone a heads-up, remember?
Uh, his name is John.
Um, some sort of journalist.
No major crimes or atrocities.
- Is he out there right now?
- Mm-hmm.
Wow, that's freaky.
So, based on initial skimming of his file, we will run scenario G48-119.
Jeez, Louise.
Well, you have to be prepared for anything.
I mean, is John coming in thinking that he belongs, or does he know he definitely doesn't?
Dude, dude, relax.
All we have to do today is tell John he's in the Good Place, show him around the Neighborhood, and get him to Tahani's welcome party.
That's it.
We can deal with the rest later.
- Right?
- Right.
- Right, right, right.
- Hey, listen whatever your plan is, it's gonna be great.
We trust you.
Your friends will always trust you.
- Okay.
Here I go.
- Okay.
I'm gonna Yep.
Here I go.
I go here.
And - I'm gone.
- Michael?
- Oh, yeah, I'm gone.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I can't do this.
Hello?
Is anyone here?
Michael, buddy, John is awake.
- We need to open the door - Mm-hmm.
And welcome him into the afterlife.
Remember, the whole plan?
I do remember.
That's why I can't do it.
It's just too scary.
Oh  No  Hello?
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1 That's why I can't do it.
It's just too scary.
Oh, ho, ho, ho.
No!
Hello?
Okay, listen.
There's a guy out there who's awake and doesn't know what's happening, okay?
You gotta pull it together.
You've got this.
No, I absolutely do not.
I'm not meant for any of this, Eleanor.
- I'm just middle management!
-  What if I fail?
It'll be like the failure to end all failures.
It'll be an epic fail.
Is my tie getting tighter, or is my neck getting fatter somehow?
Oh, this is what we do.
We tell the judge we have to cancel the experiment because I have a fat neck.
She'll understand.
Anyone?
Uh, okay, Michael.
Listen.
You can do this.
You are Michael.
You are smart and capable.
And you're a fearless leader.
And you are gonna take a deep breath, stand up, open that door and say, "Hi, John.
I'm Michael.
I'm the Architect.
Come on in".
Got it?
Hi, John.
I'm Eleanor.
I'm the Architect.
Come on in.
So, let me sum this up for you, John.
- Ya dead.
- What?
But don't worry, it's okay that you're dead, because you, John Wheaton, are in the Good Place.
You're here because of all the incredible things you did on Earth, which are all right in front of me, so let me just check your file.
Mmm, good.
Yes.
That's what I thought.
Wow, John, what a life you've led.
Sorry, did I introduce Michael?
He's my assistant.
Hi.
He just transferred over here from Dog heaven, so, you know, he's still getting used to people.
What do you say I show you around the neighborhood?
So are you, like, an angel or something?
Oh, John, aren't you sweet?
Enough about me.
So, everything you see is here for you to enjoy for eternity, you and your 321 neighbors.
Ooh, uh, why is it 322 people?
Is that number significant somehow?
Well Janet?
-  - Hi, there.
It's me, Eleanor, the Architect of the neighborhood.
Yep, that is certainly information that I already knew.
Janet is a walking database of all the knowledge in the universe, and since you, John, seem to like asking a relentless number of questions, go ahead.
Ask her anything.
Okay, um, what's the craziest secret celebrity hook up?
Drake and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, on and off for years.
Okay, wow.
Wait, so you really do know everything?
Kinda seems like she should be running the neighborhood.
Yes, John, in retrospect, that does seem like a much better idea.
Hey, Janet, why don't you take John inside to get some froyo?
We'll catch up with you later.
Get over here now, dummy.
- I'm sorry.
- Guys.
- Guys, guys, guys.
- Uh-oh.
Michael looks like me.
That's bad.
Fun little update.
Michael was feeling a bit overwhelmed.
So, new plan.
I'm now the Architect.
And stop making those faces because I already told John, and there's no going back now.
Well, if I could pick anyone to impersonate an immortal deity, well, it would be me, but if it couldn't be me, it'd be you.
Yeah, you're gonna rock this.
You're like the Blake Bortles of whatever's going on right now.
- I'm not really sure.
- Thanks, guys.
I think I can be the Architect.
I saw how Michael ran the neighborhood in the memories he showed me and there was, like, a four-year period where Brad Pitt really wanted everyone to know how into Architecture he was, and I read a lot of those interviews, so I think that might help me.
And before long, Michael will be back to his old self and he can step in and take over, right?
Look at the four of you all together.
Oh, I love you so much.
Okay, okay.
That's okay.
Chidi, have Janet translate the gibberish of these files.
Tahani, continue working on the welcome party.
Oh, yes, the party.
So, for the napkins, I would normally do a queen's tuck, but I was thinking of shaking things up a bit with a Yorkshire butterfly.
And this could not matter less.
Very sorry.
- Good-bye.
-  - Hey, how's it going?
- This is overwhelming.
It's every thought and decision and action from this guy's entire life.
Like, this whole box is just one trip to Wendy's.
Well, keep reading.
According to Michael, I usually asked for your help by, like, day two, so you need to be ready.
You know what?
At first, I was kinda nervous.
But so far, I think I'm doing okay.
It's like I became such a good person I almost forgot I'm a world-class liar, baby.
Very fun thing to hear from your girlfriend.
You're doing great, and I have to admit, you being the Architect is kinda hot.
It's kinda like I'm secretly dating my boss not that I ever would have done that.
Yeah, no, me neither.
So, same.
Same.
All right, I gotta get ready for the next person.
Well then, I will say good-bye to you platonically the same way a resident would say good-bye to an Architect.
Eleanor, what if John had seen us?
I'm scared, and yet somehow turned on?
Scared is the best way to be horny.
Oh, now who's doing the teaching?
-  - Hey, now, all right.
A little higher.
Thank you.
Tahani Al-Jamil.
Yes?
Do I know you?
Uh, no, no, but I know you.
I used to write about you all the time on my blog.
"The Gossip Toilet".
We were the ones that invented the Olsen twins countdown clock for when they became legal.
That was our blog.
That was us.
Oh, my.
You were quite mean to me.
Oh, no.
I wouldn't call it mean, okay?
My targets were rich and high status and I was just doing the important work of telling truth to power.
So, wait, what about you, huh?
You died in Canada?
That is so weird and embarrassing.
That's like the nip slip of dying  Okay, listen.
We're gonna catch up later.
I can't wait to hear all about your new nose.
Oh, no.
I didn't get a nose job.
Oh, I know, I just figured we're in heaven so we might as well fix all of our flaws, right?
Like, look at me.
Nothing is staying on this face.
-  Gosh.
- Huh.
What are the odds that you and I would end up spending eternity together?
Eleanor, Michael, it is I, Tahani.
Yeah, we know, babe.
What's wrong?
I know John rather, he knows me.
He's a gossip columnist who tortured me on Earth.
He made it seem like I was shallow, plagued with jealousy, and prone to fits of melodrama.
- What are you saying?
- Don't you see?
The Bad Place didn't pick the worst people.
They picked the people who would be the worst for us.
Of course.
How did I not anticipate this?
Shawn didn't just choose a bunch of serial killers.
He chose your tormenters or arch rivals.
Or exes.
Those motherforkers.
This is insane and obviously against the rules.
Yeah, too bad it's not, dill hole.
She'll remember them.
It's going to destroy the integrity of the experiment, Your Honor.
Plus, now I have to live next to a man who once lied and said I wasn't at Diddy's White Party.
I was there, Eleanor.
I was.
You must believe me.
And how are we gonna make Simone better when she's asleep the whole time?
Hello?
We can't work with this.
Your Honor, you never stipulated that we couldn't choose people who had some sort of connection to them.
And Simone just happened to die on Earth, which was really, really cool  You wanna know how it happened, Chidi?
It's hilarious.
- No!
- Okay, here's my ruling.
It's not against the rules for the four new humans to have connections to the original four.
- Simone and John can stay.
- Booyah.
But it was kind of a dirty trick, so Michael can erase Simone's memory to the point before she met any of you.
Fine.
Have fun with your ex, Chidi.
What's that thing you humans say when you're playing chess and you trap your opponent into an inescapable position?
Oh, right.
Eat butt, you ding dongs.
Okay, okay.
Focus, team.
Michael and I will prep for Simone.
Tahani, keep an eye on John.
Jason, talk to no one.
Go nowhere.
- Do nothing.
- I won't let you down.
Okay, go, guys.
- Are you okay?
- I no.
Very obviously, no.
Look, you could spend 100 years in this neighborhood before you even run into Simone.
It'll be easy to avoid her.
No, no, but we don't want me to avoid her.
The whole plan is that I'm supposed to help them learn ethics so they can improve.
Okay, okay.
We can deal with that later.
Let's just take this step by step.
Step one, you leave so I can snap your amnesiac ex-girlfriend out of her post-death coma and welcome her into fake heaven.
That's step one?
- Janet?
- Hi, there.
Give me your opinion.
Is this a savage insult?
"Nice shirt.
Who designed it?
Marc Fake-obs"?
For people in your social class, that is 84% savage.
Although there is a 29% chance he responds, "Oh, honey," in a tone so devastating you will think of it every day for the rest of time.
I like those odds.
I'll go lay it on him now.
No.
That's exactly what the Bad Place wants me to do.
They sent John here to drag me back into my old patterns insecurity, obsession with social status.
I shan't let it happen.
John, I'm happy you're here with me.
This is going to be good for both of us, and I look forward to putting the past behind us and becoming your friend.
Oh, my God.
You are so cute.
You are so cute, it's gross.
You disgust me.
I love you.
Get out of here.
I never want to see you again.
I love you so much.
Hi, Simone.
I'm Eleanor.
Come on in.
So, as a neuroscientist, are you surprised there's an afterlife?
I am, frankly.
I mean, there's a decent chance this entire thing is just a complex electrochemical reaction caused by my synapses randomly firing in the millisecond after my death.
But this fro-yo is amazing, so I'm just gonna roll with it.
What flavor did you get?
I got a twist half strawberry, half male-coworker-gets-called- out-for-stealing-your-ideas.
- Ooh, those go great together.
- Mmm.
- Hi.
- Mmm, hi.
Wow, all the other residents seem so nice.
- The residents are great, yes.
-  But, uh, don't feel like you need to get to know all of them right away.
Maybe just talk to Michael and me for the first I dunno, 6,000 years or so.
Anyway, you just chill, baby girl.
We'll check in with you later.
That went pretty well, right?
I've always been good at pretending I've never met people before.
It's kinda my go-to power move.
I think this new dynamic may actually be good.
You know, it gives me more time to observe and plan.
You'll be the face of the operation and I'll be the mastermind behind the scenes, like Cyrano De Bergerac.
Like, Kris Jenner.
Oh!
Totally.
Yeah, I think this is gonna be okay.
- Yeah.
- No, it won't.
It won't be okay, which is why you need to erase my memory and reboot me.
What are you talking about?
No forking way.
- We're not rebooting you.
- Shawn was right.
Bringing Simone to this neighborhood, it's checkmate.
It completely neutralizes me.
I'll be too freaked out to help the new residents.
The only way to outflank Shawn is to make it so I don't remember Simone.
So, you have to run into your ex occasionally.
That's a part of life, man.
I used to run into my exes all the time at the mall, at the dentist office, when I drunk texted them and told them to come over.
Look, Simone is really perceptive.
I might slip up and reveal something.
Look, this isn't just about me feeling awkward around my ex.
It's more about, if I am awkward around my ex, everyone gets tortured forever.
No, there has to be another way.
Oh, I've got it.
Just remove Simone from Chidi's memory and keep everything else.
- Boom.
- It doesn't work that way.
You all spent a lot of time together, so his memories of you and her are all swirled together.
But let's keep thinking.
Guys, I've thought about this from every angle.
If we don't wipe my memory, I will, one way or the other, ruin the experiment.
- You know I'm right.
- No.
No, man.
It can't be, because if we erase your memory all the way back to before you met Simone, that includes Australia and the study and the Soul Squad and everything.
- That would be erasing - Us.
I know.
So, the plan is to erase Chidi's memory all the way back to when the air conditioner fell on his head in his original timeline.
The judge has given us until tomorrow morning before we have to bring in the other two subjects.
Tahani, the welcome party will be tomorrow night.
Next time you see me, it'll be like I'm a new resident.
I won't know any of you.
So, will you remember that time in Australia when we stayed up late and we ate pizza together?
No, buddy, I won't.
Will you remember when we ordered the pizza?
No.
Will you remember pizza?
Will I remember what pizza is?
Yeah.
I'll still know what pizza is.
- Okay, so not a total loss.
- But this is awful.
You two won't be together anymore.
I haven't met a more perfect couple since I set up Drake with Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Yes, we will no longer be together.
The Bad Place has pulled off the most intricate cork blork of all time.
Hmm, it's a nice touch that the cursing filter maintains the rhyme.
I appreciate that attention to detail.
Hang on.
I'm not giving up yet.
Let's have an old-fashioned brainstorming session.
We'll get Chinese food, and we'll throw pencils and stick them in the ceiling, and someone will say something innocuous and I'll say, "Wait.
Say that again".
Michael, if there was another choice, we'd choose it.
Believe me.
You like learning about humans, right?
This is a classic human situation.
Your friends are going through something awful, and there is nothing you can do about it.
Anyway, let's just rip the Band-Aid off.
Snappy, snappy, wipey, wipey.
I need a few minutes to work it all out, so   I hate this.
And I'm sorry.
And did I say that I hate this?
Because I hate this.
You don't need to apologize for making a huge sacrifice to save your friends.
This is why people love moral philosophy professors.
Well, how about this?
Every time you see me get a stomach ache, imagine I'm thinking of you.
So, all the time?
Exactly.
Sorry to interrupt.
I wanted to give both of you something before we do this.
Think of it as a going-away present.
- -    I don't normally cry at movies  But that one was pretty good  That girl was hot.
The guy was, too.
I'm gonna miss you so much, Eleanor.
Except you won't.
That's what's so scary about this whole thing.
I'm gonna miss you.
You're just gonna think I'm some sexy godlike figure who you wanna hump immediately after meeting her.
I know you're deflecting by making jokes about how hot you are.
It's not a joke.
I'm a legit snack.
- But I believe in you.
-  I am not even scared to get rebooted because I know that you'll be here, taking care of me.
I wish we had more time together.
Oh, time means nothing.
Jeremy Bearimy, baby.
We'll just get through this.
And then you and I can chill out in the dot of the eye forever.
Right.
We'll be okay.
We found each other before hundreds of times.
We can do it again.
Bye, Chidi.
- Janet?
-  - Hi, there.
- Hi, Janet.
Can you just, you know, like, tell me the answer?
Sorry?
You know, the answer to everything.
You know all there is to know in the universe.
Crunch the numbers.
Tell me the answer.
What's the point of love if it's just gonna disappear?
And how is it worse to not love anybody?
There has to be meaning to existence, otherwise the universe is just made of pain, and I don't like the thought of that, so tell me the answer.
I know how you feel.
Back on Earth, I had to watch Jason have no recognition of me.
It felt like right before someone pushes a plunger and murders you.
Sure.
The more human I become, the less things make sense.
But that's part of the fun, right?
What do you mean?
If there were an answer I could give you to how the universe works, it wouldn't be special.
It would just be machinery fulfilling its cosmic design.
It would just be a big, dumb food processor.
But since nothing seems to make sense, when you find something or someone that does, it's euphoria.
In all this randomness and this pandemonium, you and Chidi found each other, and you had a life together.
Isn't that remarkable?
Pandemonium is from "Paradise Lost".
Milton called the center of hell, "Pandemonium," meaning, "place of all demons".
Chidi tricked me into reading "Paradise Lost" by telling me Satan was, and I quote, "my type".
A big, mean, bald guy with a goatee.
- I mean, he wasn't wrong.
- Oh, no.
That's very on brand for you.
I guess all I can do is embrace the pandemonium, find happiness in the unique insanity of being here, now.
We'll do this together.
In the words of the man that I love, "I got you, dog".
- Thanks, Janet.
- Mmm.
You know, for a robot, you make a really good girl friend.
I'm one out of three of those things, but thank you.
Good luck.
Okay.
Hi, Chidi.
I'm Eleanor.
Come on in.
