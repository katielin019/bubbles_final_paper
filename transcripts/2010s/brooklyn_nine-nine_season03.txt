{START OF EPISODE 1}
Previously on "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" I'm being transferred to the public relations office.
I am leaving the Nine-Nine effective immediately.
Hello.
I'm your new commanding officer, Captain Seth Dozerman.
My motto is simple: Efficiency, efficiency, efficiency.
Could probably just say it once.
Are you making fun of my stutter?
Oh, uh Tricked you.
I don't have a stutter.
Boom, I've already established my authority through my amazing sense of humor.
Well done, sir.
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.
I'm Sergeant Terry Jeffords.
And I'm not interested.
I have no use for people.
I find people weird and confusing.
I live my life by numbers.
You see this watch?
It tells me how many calories I burn at any time.
Question: How many calories do you think I burned walking from there to there?
You, female closest to me.
Oh, uh, three?
Three?
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Try 0.8, numbnuts.
I have made promises to my superiors that I most certainly cannot keep.
That's why I need you idiots to work twice as hard.
No, no, strike that.
Four times as hard.
No, no, no, strike that.
I need you morons to work eight times harder than you've ever worked in your entire life!
I'm having a heart attack.
Yeah, I'm having a heart attack.
Get back to work.
Get a doctor!
Yeah, I'm just gonna make some copies in here.
Perfect cover.
Nailed it.
So apparently, the new captain survived, and his heart attack not the craziest thing that happened at the precinct today.
We kissed, like, three hours ago.
Yes, we did kiss each other for reals.
For reals, reals.
Listen.
I know you said you don't want to date cops, but I really like you.
I like you too.
Good.
But what if we start dating and it makes things weird at work?
So let's just keep it light and breezy, see where it goes.
Totally.
Yeah.
So how do we keep it light and breezy?
I know.
A comprehensive set of rules.
How am I attracted to you?
Doesn't matter.
I am.
Go.
Rule one, let's not tell anyone so we can figure out what this is first.
Smort.
Rule number two, let's not put labels on it.
We're not boyfriend and girlfriend; We're just "mrmmzeep" and "jinglebin".
Great.
Rule number three, let's not have sex right away.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool No doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt.
Good rule.
No sex, good rule.
So should we go out tonight?
Yeah, totally.
Maybe 8:00, maybe 9:00.
Doesn't matter.
We're light and breezy.
Totally light and breezy.
No!
Briefing room.
Five minutes.
Wow, very chill.
Wuntch.
Hello, Raymond.
You're looking old and sickly.
So nice of you to greet us, Madeline.
I thought surely you'd still be crushed under that house in Munchkinland.
Sticks and stones, Raymond.
Describing your breakfast?
I came out as a gay cop in the 1980s, so it's gonna take more than reassigning me to break my spirit.
I'll turn this place around just like I did the Nine-Nine.
I doubt that.
Everyone, this is your new commanding officer, Raymond Holt.
He's going to be with you for a long, long time.
Thank you, Chief Wuntch.
I'm excited to be back.
I look forward to doing meaningful work beginning with my eight-point plan for community engagement.
Wonderful.
But no new initiatives until you finish the meaningful work that's already in progress here.
Could be a while, Raymond.
They're trying to come up with a name for the NYPD's new pigeon mascot.
Oh, no.
What?
Naming a pigeon?
How long could that possibly take?
They've been at it for months.
I love my life.
Holy Moses, he's alive.
So I want to explain what happened back there.
I did not have a heart attack.
The doctors have informed me that I have a genetic heart condition.
My aortic valve is 16% too narrow, which lowers my life expectancy from 103 to 64.
So sorry, sir.
That's terrible.
Yes, it's depressing.
They also informed me that I carry the gene for webbed feet, which is interesting, more than anything else.
But, uh, when you stare death in the face, as I have, it really puts things into perspective, namely that I've been wasting too much of my time farting around!
So that stops now!
Say good-bye to the fun, hilarious, laid-back Seth Dozerman that you used to love.
Boys, hand 'em out!
What the hell are these?
"What the hell are these"?
These are Dozer-pads.
Each one is equipped with a GPS system and a countdown clock to remind you to complete a task every 55 minutes.
It also has backgammon on it, which I could not delete but you are not allowed to play.
What happens when the clock runs out?
Failure.
Failure.
You are behind schedule!
- Oh, that's fun.
- Yeah.
Your 55 minutes starts right now.
Sarge, I don't need to be monitored all day long.
I'm not a toddler.
This is stupid.
I know you're not a toddler, because my toddlers know that "stupid" is a no-no word.
Keep that Dozer-pad on you at all times.
Fine, but I am gonna play the hell out of some backgammon.
Watch me.
Bouche Manger.
Oh, small plates, casual-chic ambiance, no free soda refills Jakey's going on a date.
Are you going on a date with Amy?
What?
No.
Why?
Uh, because you guys just kissed on that mission.
Charles, we just kissed 'cause we were undercover.
- That's it.
- Yeah, it didn't mean anything.
Not that it's any of your business, Boyle, but the person that I'm taking on a date is a girl from the gym.
What?
Why is this the first time I'm hearing about her?
Or that you go to the gym?
Jake, avoid the weights.
Nobody wants you turning into another Terry.
Ugh.
Hey, people like the way that I look.
Sure they do, big guy.
Look, I can't believe you're gonna take some fitness floozy to Bouche Manger.
You should be going with Amy.
Right, Amy?
Uh Whatever, dog.
Date the flooze.
See?
It's never gonna happen, Boyle, okay?
Because I find Amy repulsive, and she finds me extremely handsome.
So stop pressuring us.
Oh, you sweet, naive boy.
I haven't even begun to pressure you two.
I've already written my best man speech for your wedding.
Oh, I'm gonna need you to get married on a farm.
A lot of my jokes rely on that.
So here we are, officially on a date, romantical date.
Yes, we are.
No longer just colleagues.
Dating.
You got a haircut.
It looks nice.
Oh, thanks.
You also got a haircut at some point in your life.
I'm sure that's not your baby hair.
That would be crazy.
But, uh Yeah, you look very nice.
Domo arigato.
Do you speak Japanese?
- No.
- Oh.
Uh sorry.
I think I'm feeling a little awkward.
Yeah, me too.
How do we make it not weird?
I know.
Let's just get super drunk.
Yes, great idea.
Pardon me, ma'am.
Could you please bring us four kamikaze shots?
And four for me as well.
Ah, I like your style.
See, we can do this.
We're back on track.
We're keeping it light and breezy.
So we broke a rule.
Yeah.
I hope it wasn't a mistake.
"I Hope It Wasn't a Mistake," title of your sex tape?
Title of our sex tape.
So how was the date with the floozy?
We are not leaving these seats until you give me some deets.
All right, fine.
It started off a bit rocky, but it ended up being really fun.
Did you kiss?
Did you french?
Boyle, I'm not gonna answer that.
And no one over the age of 12 says "french".
Oh, that's a yes.
Oh, my God, you had sex.
I can tell because you're glowing.
Ugh, Jake, no one wants to hear about your sex life.
You just asked me repeatedly.
Because I was rooting for you and Amy, but now I can see you're super serious about this anonymous gym seductress.
Ugh, I'm so sorry, Amy.
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm I would never date Jake.
I work with Jake.
I'd love to see you date someone from work.
Your head would explode.
Your head would explode because of how well I would handle it.
Mm.
Sick burn.
Peralta, Dozerman says he wants to see you.
Captain, everything all right?
You tell me.
According to your Dozer-pad, four of your coworkers have been gathered around your desk for the last 90 seconds.
Also, someone named Norm Scully has been in the bathroom for the last 72 minutes.
Oh, yeah, that means he's about halfway.
But in regards to the coworkers, sir, I was telling them I wanted to get more work done, but all they wanted to do was talk about my dating life, knowing full well that my true love is efficiency.
You know my motto, sir.
Cho's before hos.
"Cho's" is "chores".
What?
I like you.
I could tell from the moment I walked in here that we were one and the same detail-oriented, love crunching numbers.
Bet your apartment's immaculate.
Could probably eat off the floor.
- And I do.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna handle this for you.
- Okay.
I'm gonna send out a Dozerblast.
Hey, everyone stop talking about Peralta's personal life.
Dozerblast over.
Well, thank you very much, sir, and might I just say that this has been a Dozerblast.
I saw what you did right there.
Uh?
- Get back to work.
- Okay.
I know you've been working on picking a name for the pigeon mascot for, uh Several months now.
I feel like you might need a breather, so I've prepared an eight-point presentation on community engagement.
We'll get to your presentation, Raymond.
It's on the agenda.
Well, it says here it's scheduled "after everyone leaves".
And not a minute later.
Trent, Bryce, where are we with the name?
We've narrowed it down to two choices Petey or Paulie.
With all due respect, that pigeon is clearly a Ray J. Hi.
Gina Linetti, the human form of the 100 emoji.
I'd like to hear Captain Holt's thoughts on a name.
Very well.
My thoughts are who cares?
Give us a name, Raymond.
Weigh in on this.
It's your job now.
No.
A name.
Petey or Paulie, which is it?
What does it matter?
Why'd you even choose a pigeon anyway?
It's a terrible mascot.
Because they're a staple of New York, they're nonthreatening, and they're everywhere.
They're carriers of disease, and they eat garbage!
Name the pigeon, Raymond!
- You can't make me.
- I can make you, and I will.
Name the pigeon.
That's an order!
Paulie.
Thank you.
Was that so hard?
Yeah, I'm trying to find some evidence.
I'm just gonna look in here.
Another perfect cover.
Two for two.
Nailed it.
All right, I talked to Dozerman and convinced him to outlaw all personal talk at work.
We're in the clear.
And everyone hates you for that, but this is totally working, and no one knows.
I know.
It's the best.
And you know what?
I'm glad we broke the rule and had sex on the first date.
Me too, 'cause we're, like, really good at it.
- So good, right?
- Stupid good.
It makes no sense.
We're light and breezy.
If we want to break rules, break rules.
Like, what's another rule we could break?
No making out at work.
Okay, that's very flattering, Amy, but there are some rules that I shall never - Let's go.
- Okay.
Warning.
Unknown environment.
Unknown environment.
What's that noise?
I don't hear anything.
Warning.
Unknown environment.
Unknown environment.
Warning.
Unknown environment.
What?
I put it up there for safe keeping.
- Safe keeping?
- Yeah.
I had it on my desk, but I kept spilling coffee on it.
- Oops.
- Tamper alert.
- Tamper alert.
- Come on, Diaz.
You two have been in this evidence locker for - Hey!
- What?
Nothing.
Nothing you were just making out with Peralta.
Ah, there's that candy bar wrapper I was looking for.
Oh, Santiago, what are you doing here?
So I guess it is hos before cho's with you, friend.
Now I understand why nothing gets done in this precinct.
The detectives are too busy frenching with each other, but you know what?
Your little honeymoon is over!
'Cause as long as I'm here, you two are done!
And I'm gonna be here a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long Oh, this is a heart attack.
This right here, this is a heart attack.
Ooh, it's a big one.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Oh, oh, oh.
I'm gonna get help.
Sir, it's all right.
We're getting help.
Okay.
Tell my wife that I love her work ethic.
What happened in there?
Nothing.
We were just working, separately.
Yeah, and then Dozerman just came in and died.
Peacefully, like an old cat.
Can you think of anything that may have caused Dozerman to be startled?
Ah Nope.
Uh He might have been startled by how far apart we were standing.
That seems unlikely, but obviously he had a ton of health problems, so, you know, this seems pretty open and shut.
Do me a favor and pull the surveillance tapes.
Right, the surveillance tapes.
Yep, because this is a police precinct.
You two have something to tell me?
All right, fine.
Detective Santiago and I may have been in there snorking.
Yes!
Oh!
Wait.
What about the gym floozy?
Amy was the gym floozy.
The gym floozy was under my nose the whole time.
Oh, I am over the moon.
- Okay.
- Over the moon.
- All right.
- So what is this?
Casual?
Serious?
I need to know how to make fun of you.
You guys dating?
- Yes.
- No.
Oh, that's not good.
I mean, yes.
I just said no because of the rules.
We said we weren't gonna tell anyone.
It's very new, and we're still figuring it out.
Enough.
Look.
Terry loves love, but Terry also loves maintaining a professional work environment.
As your commanding officer, I am very disappointed in both of you.
- So, Boyle - Mm.
Let's go look at those surveillance tapes, yeah?
- Oh, absolutely.
- Mm.
Captain, I know this isn't my place to say, but Madeline Wuntch is here to see you.
Actually that's exactly your place to say.
You are my assistant.
What precisely did you think your job was?
Ideally?
Bullfighter.
But it's such a boys' club.
- Hmm.
- Ooh.
I like what you've done with your office, Raymond.
It's cozy, like a shoebox one buries a dead hamster in.
So what did you want to see me about?
I'd like to propose a truce.
Our feud is getting in the way of the NYPD's business.
Madeline, the PR department is a joke.
Their work here is meaningless.
Nine weeks to choose the name Paulie.
I knew instantly it should be Pepper, Officer Pepper O'Pigeon.
Maybe we should start the whole naming process all over again.
I could turn this department around if you'd let me.
You're wasting my talents.
This man is a Timberlake, and you need to stop treating him like a Fatone.
Yes, yes, perhaps you're right.
Perhaps I am wasting your talents.
I want you to spread your wings, as it were.
I think we've found the perfect person to wear the pigeon costume.
It's you, Raymond.
Do we need to get the costume altered, or do you have your own pigeon pants?
No, Madeline, I don't have my own pigeon pants.
You are I know.
Get off my back, computer ghost.
Why are you still playing with that stupid game, Sarge?
- The guy is dead.
- It's not a game.
I'm following our captain's orders.
His orders were stupid.
I hated him more than any cop I've ever known.
Whoa.
I just realized I'm never gonna be able to say that to his face.
I mean, I could say it to his wife at the funeral, but it won't be the same.
He was trying to make our precinct better.
Look.
Holt's gone.
Dozerman died.
Who knows who we're getting next?
I'm just trying to keep this place running.
That's my job.
Case cleared!
Yeah, how do you like me now, sucker?
I mean, I hope you found peace.
Hey, so everybody knows about us now, which means all the rules have been broken and nothing bad happened.
Nothing bad happened?
Terry yelled at us, and we killed our captain.
Jake, is this a bad idea?
It seems like the universe is sending us a lot of signs that we should hit the brakes.
Hasn't exactly been light and breezy.
Yeah, it's been a little more stressful and death-y.
You have to admit it hasn't started out great.
What do you want to do, then?
Go back to being colleagues?
Yeah.
Maybe that's what it needs to be right now.
Okay.
Okay.
Sorry.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no Boyle, can we please just go to dinner?
No, no, no, no, no!
This is not how you and Amy are supposed to end.
You're supposed to grow old and die holding each other as your cruise ship slowly takes on water.
What do you want me to say?
We tried really hard.
We made rules.
We kept it light and breezy.
Light and breezy?
Ow!
Light and breezy is how you describe a linen pantsuit, not a relationship you care about.
We were just being cautious.
- Cautious?
- Ow!
You guys started this with one foot out the door.
That's what doomed you, not the universe.
Actually, it makes a lot of sense.
Ow, I was agreeing with you!
I'm sorry.
I'm just so excited about all this!
All right, so what do I do?
- Tell me.
- Easy.
You march over there, you tell her how you feel, and you bring a fancy bottle of lavender shampoo, because shampooing a woman's head is the most erotic thing you could ever possibly No, no, no shampoo.
That's the worst.
But I am gonna go over there.
I'm gonna tell her how I feel.
Yes!
Go get her.
No!
Wait till it starts raining.
No, that's crazy.
Go now.
Okay.
- Ahh!
- Sorry!
Sorry.
It's okay.
I was home, and I really wanted to talk to someone about us and Dozerman and about Holt being gone, and then I realized that the only person I want to talk about that stuff with is you.
So screw just being colleagues, and screw light and breezy, right?
Definitely.
Guys, we did it.
We really did it.
Oh, Charles is here.
Big time.
Captain.
The kids want to know where Paulie the Pigeon is.
I told 'em he got sucked up into an airplane engine.
Is that all right?
I can't put that pigeon head on, Gina.
Wuntch has defeated me.
This is how it ends, with me standing on the urine-soaked floor of an elementary school bathroom in a third-rate bird costume.
- I quit.
- No.
I did not follow you to PR to watch you quit.
I followed you because you're great and because you make everything you touch better, and I figured PR would be the easiest path to launching my reality show "Linetti, Set, Go".
I thought your reality show was to be called "Gina in a Bottle".
No, that was my fragrance line.
Keep up.
Listen.
You cannot let Wuntch defeat you.
That is not who you are.
You are a person who will go out there and deliver his eight-point plan on whatever, whatever.
- Community engagement.
- Whatever.
Even if the only people listening are a bunch of second graders, because Captain Raymond Holt never gives up!
Inspiring words.
I'm going to give that speech.
Help me with that pigeon head.
Yeah, all right.
Let's blow some tiny minds.
Rosa Diaz, you are six hours ahead of schedule.
Great job.
Wow, Diaz.
That's the first time I've seen him smile.
I didn't do it for him.
I did it 'cause it's my job.
- We cool?
- We're cool.
Good.
Damage.
Critical damage.
There's a rumor the new captain'll be here today.
Now, I don't know who Wuntch is sending us, but it doesn't matter, because we're a family, we're strong, and together, we can do anything.
Nine-Nine!
Nine-Nine!
What's up, ding-dongs?
I'm your new captain.
- The Vulture.
- No.
Still hot.
Now, I know we have our history, me vulturing your cases, me telling you to eat my farts, but that's all in the past, 'cause now that I run this precinct, things are gonna get much, much worse.
So suck it.
No!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Okay, squad, the funeral's at 3:00, followed by a reception at Shaw's Bar.
I want you all on your best behavior.
Yeah, and all eyes are gonna be on us because Frick and Frack here killed Captain Dozerman.
Hey, we accidentally startled a man with a genetic heart condition.
If you really think about it, his parents killed him.
All right, whatever.
Look, there's a horse race going off in Dubai.
I got serious money on it.
Dismissed.
Oh, yeah, we should all check out that race.
God.
He is the worst captain we've ever had.
He drew boobies on my bulletproof vest.
He stared at me for 90 seconds while he ate an entire peach.
He heard that I speak Spanish, and he made me fire his housekeeper.
She was Polish.
At least he doesn't practice his crane kicks with you.
I said not to move!
I didn't move.
Listen, guys.
Jake and I were talking last night.
Pillow talk alert!
Set the scene.
- Spooning or face-to-face?
- Charles.
Spooning.
Anyway, we came up with a plan.
Jake is going to befriend the Vulture so he lays off of us.
It's true.
I'm gonna bro down with him.
If everything goes according to plan, we should be beer pong doubles partners by the end of the week.
Now somebody get me a puka shell necklace.
I'm going full douche.
Okay.
Hey, 'sup, bro?
'Sup, Jake?
Got a little update for you on that Deberg assault case.
Turns out the victim's wife was super hot.
Yeah, I read the file.
She's a mom.
Not interested.
True that.
So listen, I've been thinking.
We got off on the wrong foot here.
And I believe it's 'cause we're just too damn similar.
- You do?
- Absolutely.
We both love premium tequila Yeah.
- Robin Thicke.
- Oh, yeah.
- Gots to have my puks.
- Gots to.
And of course, Nip slips.
Let me ask you a question, Jake.
You also like Okinawan martial arts?
Because you left this in my back.
Hmm?
What I'm saying, Einstein, is that you stabbed me in my back.
How so?
We came up with a plan.
Jake is going to befriend the Vulture so he lays off of us.
Busted.
I knew that you were faking it.
I'll bet you don't even like nip slips!
So, what, you bugged the briefing room?
No, Scully butt-dialed me yesterday and he still hasn't hung up.
Once again, Scully's butt is the downfall of this precinct.
Look, Jake, I know that you and Santiago are trying to take me down.
You guys go home.
You lay in bed together.
You plot against me.
Well, no longer.
I want you to dump Santiago, and that's an order.
What?
You can't do that.
It's completely against the rules.
Okay, Sonia Sotomayor.
I would never break the rules.
But what I could do, for totally "unrelated reasons," is have you busted back down to a beat cop.
No, don't do that, all right?
I can learn to love nip slips.
No, you either love them, or you don't.
It's too late.
You dump Santiago, or you kiss that detective badge good-bye.
Beat it.
First time back in the Nine-Nine.
Mm.
I really miss these people, the whole crew Jake, Terry, bleh.
I forget all the other names.
Just remember, we're here as PR representatives.
I don't wanna be disruptive.
Too bad.
We're like rock stars to these people.
They're gonna go nuts, just like I would hate it if these doors opened and everyone stopped working to applaud us.
Hmm, nothing.
You must be loving this.
Yes.
What?
He's ordering us to break up?
Look, we can deal with this.
We just need a new plan.
I got it.
We lie, tell him we broke up, and then date in secret.
Great!
And you'd be okay lying to your captain?
- Okay, new plan.
- Uh-huh.
Captain Holt is here today.
Yes, genius!
He loves us, and he's got tons of sway in the department.
He'll tell the Vulture to back down.
Yeah, he'll be all "Vulture, I must insist that you desist".
I really think this is gonna work.
Also, if you ever want to bust out that Holt impression at home, I'd be okay with that.
Oh, okay.
Duly noted, super disturbing, but I'm definitely gonna do it.
Hey, G-spot!
Rosa, Charles, oh, I missed you guys so much.
Really, 'cause when you left, you made a pretty big deal of deleting us from your phone.
Girl, that was just the showman in me.
PR is so boring.
I need some Nine-Nine drama, stat.
I don't think we're that dramatic.
I've been gone one week.
Jake and Amy are dating, and they've killed a person.
Come on, Charles.
You got to have something weird and tragic going on.
Nope.
Not unless you call hooking up with a girl at a funeral "weird and tragic".
Home run!
Her name is Lieutenant Singh.
She's super hot.
We were seated next to each other two funerals ago.
And there was hard eye contact all through "Danny Boy".
Last funeral, we made out in the parking lot.
This time Something naughty this way comes.
Ugh.
What do you even know about this person?
Oh, we don't know anything about each other.
She says she likes that about us.
It's just pure animal attraction.
This is creepy and unlike you.
You even know her first name?
Oh, um, do animals in the wild know each other's names?
Look, all I know is, Charles Boyle is going to that funeral, and he's going to put the "bone" back in boneyard.
Hmm, strange to be on this side of the desk.
Why?
Oh, right, you used to work here.
You know I made a lot of improvements since you left?
I got a fridge for my protein shakes.
I got a kettlebell station.
I got a wolf that I killed in Utah.
I'm fairly certain that's a dog.
Yeah, it was dark.
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I need you to sign these Captain Holt, I didn't realize you were here.
Sergeant Jeffords, hello.
Welcome back.
Hey, you know, I'm gonna stop you right there.
Hugs are a form of inappropriate workplace touching.
Trust me, I'm very familiar with the sexual harassment guidelines.
That'll be all.
Well, I won't take up too much of your time.
Because the Nine-Nine was Captain Dozerman's last precinct, you will be seated at the front of the funeral.
I wanted to alert you that there'll be press, cameras Whoa, whoa, whoa, cameras?
Crap, nobody said anything about cameras.
I got to rock the bells.
There we go.
Oh, I noticed in the bullpen that you had changed the case numbering system.
I found, when I was commanding officer, that I'm gonna stop you right there.
You're not commanding officer anymore.
I was making a suggestion.
Yeah, look, you did a lot of good for this place while you were here, which is great for me, because I get to take credit for it.
But you're not a real cop anymore.
You're a desk jockey.
This is my precinct now.
And the sooner that you accept that, the better.
Yes, well, I know my way out.
'Cause you used to work here.
I keep forgetting.
Everybody does.
Well, well, if it isn't Captain Raymond Jacob Holt.
It's great to see you back at the Nine-Nine, sir.
Yes.
There it is, that classic Jake Holt banter, zingers just flying around.
It's like you never left.
No, I most definitely left.
Okay.
Well, I know how much you love hot goss, so you probably heard Amy and I have been dating.
And we would love your approval.
No.
But that's not what this is about.
It sure is not.
Sir, the Vulture is out of control.
All right, he told me if I don't dump Amy, he's gonna demote me.
You got to help us.
Let me stop you right there, Peralta.
I'm not the Chief of Detectives.
I'm not the Vulture's boss.
I'm just some guy in PR.
- But we thought - I can't save your ass.
I don't work here anymore.
And the sooner you accept that, the better.
Well, looks like somebody's got a bad case of the funeral crankies.
Okay, guys, I know Captain Dozerman was a nightmare and that none of us liked him.
But I'm gonna need all of you to pretend like you're sad.
Everyone make a sad face.
Scully, you are nailing it!
My wife just texted.
She's leaving me.
Good, use it.
Now, anyone seen Captain Holt?
He seemed a little down when he came in.
Yeah, he let me choose the music on the way over here, which leads me to believe he's given up on life.
I got to go find him.
Now, be respectful and grieve your asses off.
I don't know why this is happening.
Scully, I love it!
Everyone follow his lead.
So what are we gonna do about the Vulture?
I've got a new plan.
Pretend like we're talking.
- We are talking.
- Exactly.
It's working already.
Now I'm going to coolly run my hands through my hair.
Look where my elbow's pointing.
It's Davis Garmin, Chief of Detectives.
Holt said he could overrule the Vulture.
Exactly.
The only question now is, will he believe us?
Yes, 'cause we're gonna take a page from the Vulture's book.
- "The Big Book of Small Butts"?
- What?
It's the only thing I've ever seen him read.
No, we're gonna secretly record the Vulture telling you to dump me.
Then we'll play it for Chief Garmin.
Then We're gonna totally have sex on top of each other.
You get to keep your job.
Yes, that.
Ooh, Charles, your jump-off is here.
Hello, Detective.
Hello, Lieutenant.
Real tragic about the captain.
Yes, real tragic.
I like the way your butt looks today.
I've been doing lunges in the shower.
Well, this got upsetting real quick.
I want to live in this moment forever.
I got us a motel room across the street.
Meet me there in 15 minutes.
I'll meet you, all right.
M-E-A-T.
Still think it's creepy?
Yes.
Charles, it is not like you to have sex with a total stranger.
Really, tell that to me in an hour when we've had sex 23 times.
There you are.
You okay, sir?
No.
Until this morning, some small part of me still believed I would be captain of the Nine-Nine again.
What a fool I was.
I should never have returned.
It's like visiting your childhood home and seeing it's been replaced by a denim pants store.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Slow down, sir.
You didn't even stop and sniff the bouquet.
You always sniff the bouquet.
Maybe the old Holt did.
But the new Holt chugs Beaujolais from a Burgundy glass without a care.
Oh, it's a Sauternes glass.
Look, the alcohol has rendered me a simpleton.
Maybe you should just call it a day.
I can't.
I've been asked to deliver a toast here after the funeral, a message of hope.
This is what I have so far.
"Pain" That's it.
One tweak maybe you should lose the word "pain" and then get in a cab and go home.
Maybe I will.
But first, you're gonna have one drink with me, Sergeant.
For old times' sake?
- One drink, and then we go.
- One drink.
Sisters are doin' it for themselves My tolerance has really changed since I had kids!
Hey, Captain.
I was looking for you inside.
One thing I won't do is fart in church.
This is God's house.
Oh.
Respectful.
So listen, remember when you said to me that I have to dump Santiago or else you're gonna bust me down to beat cop?
What I remember, Jake, is you pretending to be my bro and me being like, "I'm onto you, dillweed.
Oh, uh, sorry, could you say that one more time?
I couldn't hear you over the bagpipes.
Ugh, one second.
Excuse me, could you stop playing that?
Just trying to have a conversation.
I'm warming up, man.
Sorry.
Yeah, I know.
We just need two minutes.
No can do.
The funeral's about to start.
Everyone wants to hear me honk, so Do you really need to warm up, though?
I mean, you're just gonna make a terrible wall of sound.
First of all, that's offensive to me as half Scottish.
Second of all, you think you could do better?
Blow my bag.
Look, we just need a couple of minutes to chat.
That's it.
I'm not gonna stop playing until you blow it.
All right, just give it to me.
All right?
Prepare to hear me play the bagpipes perfectly.
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Point proven.
Yeah, I think I've heard just about enough of this catfight.
I'm out.
Wait, Captain!
Sir!
Your boyfriend sorry, your ex-boyfriend is pathetic.
You should be glad that I ordered him to dump you.
Swish, Kobe.
Got it.
Yes!
You're amazing!
That was "We Are the Champions".
Ugh, it's impossible to find Garmin with everybody mourning all over the place.
It's like they have no respect for our sneaky plans.
I know.
Oh, look, there he is.
Oh, great.
Hi there.
Sorry, this area is reserved for close personal friends of the deceased.
Ah, well, that is us.
Dozerman and I were pretty much besties.
Went on an annual fishing trip together.
Cayuga Lake, caught a lot of Coho salmon.
We are both so bummed that he's dead.
Super bummed.
Oh, right on.
Come in.
Thanks.
Blessings to you.
- Blessings?
- I don't know.
It's my first time in a church.
All right, how did you do that?
Simple detective work.
There was a floral arrangement up front with a picture of Dozerman and 30 of his friends holding a big fish.
Cayuga Lake, I pulled straight from the guest book.
And Coho salmon?
Well, that's just something I know about from being a man of the world.
Our special today is Coho salmon on a Sounds disgusting.
Do you have chicken fingers?
- Impressed?
- Mm-hmm.
And horrified by your eating habits.
Well, if I'm so unhealthy, how come I never go to the bathroom?
- Okay, let's get to Garmin.
- Yeah.
Hi, I'm Margaret Dozerman.
How did you know my husband?
Oh, Mrs. Dozerman, your husband was a great man.
Some of my fondest memories of him were on our fishing trips.
You went on those trips?
I did, indeed.
They called me "the Coho King".
Pretty much single-handedly organized those things myself.
So you were the one who brought all the prostitutes?
Uh Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can we slow down?
Why?
Are you not into this?
No, no, no.
My friends are just in my head.
They think it's weird that we don't know anything about each other.
I think it's hot.
Totally, I'm glad we're not interested in each other as human beings.
Oh, how about if you tell me things about yourself and then I tell you how little I care about them?
Okay.
Okay, here goes.
I'm an only child.
- Not interested.
- I was born in Delaware.
Who even asked you?
I like this.
I don't care what you like.
But maybe you could tell me one more thing.
She's a vegan!
What is going on?
You're right.
I couldn't help myself.
I wanted to know about her.
And I got what I deserved a vegan, a gluten-free vegan!
Charles, you need to calm down.
No.
You called it, Rosa.
So go ahead.
Laugh at me!
Laugh!
Laugh it up!
Can I wait till after the funeral?
Shh!
Of course you can.
Sir, my life stinks.
Sharon's on bed rest.
My favorite mango yogurt got discontinued.
And my kids think their preschool teacher's a stupidface.
Everyone I work with is a stupidface.
Especially Bryce.
- Sir?
- Hmm?
- Sir?
- Hmm?
- Sir?
- Hmm?
Can I be honest?
Precinct's not the same without you.
The Vulture's the worst.
My mango yogurt Yes, you already mentioned the yogurt.
'Cause it's important!
When I saw you in the office this morning, I wanted to give you the biggest hug.
But the Vulture told you not to, and you had to listen.
He's your captain now, Terry.
I hate going to work and you're not there.
Everything is garbage.
Hmm.
"Everything is garbage".
I should put that in my message of hope.
That's a really good idea!
It took my husband and me years of counseling to get over those little backwood orgies of yours.
He had sex with five prostitutes in one weekend.
- Ugh!
- That's bananas!
I had no idea.
I was probably too busy praying.
You said you planned the trips.
- Yeah, I did say that.
- Called yourself the Coho King.
All right, look.
I'm not the Coho King.
My name is Jake.
And your husband was only my captain for, like, a day.
Wait a second.
Are you the Jake that killed him?
No, I'm prostitute Jake.
I love prostitutes.
You need to go.
You should leave right now.
You need to leave right now.
It's okay, Margaret.
Come on.
Oh, Chief Garmin, wait, I just need to play you one quick recording of my boss.
You recorded me?
That's not cool, Jake.
Well, we were just taking a page out of your book.
Yeah?
What are you gonna do next, huh?
Are you gonna start wearing leather bracelets, hmm?
Good luck pulling off that chunky-B with those skinny little girl wrists of yours.
Congratulations.
You're no longer a detective.
You're a beat cop again.
I just crushed your dreams.
Okay, I know things seem really bad right now, but we just need a minute to think.
Come on, man!
Okay, so the Vulture has your phone.
But new plan Jake, we've had lots of plans, and none of them have worked.
Yeah, but this is a good one.
No plan.
We wing it!
Probably won't work, but I said it with a lot of confidence.
Jake, you got demoted.
We said this relationship wasn't gonna get in the way of our careers, and it has.
So what?
We'll figure it out.
I'll make my way back to detective.
Or maybe you won't.
I'm not gonna let you throw away your dream job.
Amy, this is good.
This is a six-day relationship.
We don't know what it is.
And now for a message of hope.
Ah, a message of hope, right on time.
Everything is garbage.
Oh, no.
You find something you care about, and it's taken from you your colleague, your dream job, your mango yogurt.
Whoo!
Never love anything.
That's the lesson.
To Captain Dozerman.
Captain Dozerman.
Thank you, sir.
I'll take it from here.
Very poetic.
If I might offer a counter-toast of sorts.
Captain Dozerman and I, we weren't together for very long.
In fact, as coworkers, our relationship was only six days.
But that's not nothing.
It was long enough for me to know that we had something special.
And sure, there may be obstacles.
Him having passed away, for example.
But I'm not giving up on us.
And I don't care if I get demoted.
I just care about being with you Captain Dozerman, an adult man who has passed into the nether world.
Move over, Peralta!
Move over!
Okay.
And if I may do a third toast.
It'll be focused primarily on the mango yogurt.
Don't boo me!
I lost something important too, shoot.
Thought I might find you here.
So not a big fan of my speech, huh?
No, I loved it.
I mean, I wish it hadn't been at a wake.
And I wish you hadn't kept referring to me as your dead boss.
Yeah, it pretty much sucked butt but still was somehow the best of the three toasts.
Hmm.
Look, I don't want to break up.
But I don't want to get demoted either.
I just don't know what to do.
I'm all out of plans.
I have one.
Holt saves your ass.
Captain.
I was moved by your speech, Peralta.
Thank you, sir.
That's very nice of you to say.
- The syntax was problematic.
- Less nice.
And your vocabulary is a true indictment of the public school system.
Seems like you're just slamming me now.
But the fact that you're not willing to give up in the face of adversity is inspiring.
I love the Nine-Nine, and I'm not gonna turn my back on the squad.
So I fixed your problem with the Vulture.
- Really?
- I may just be a guy in PR.
But what does the Vulture love more than anything?
Garbage Pail Kids?
No.
Publicity.
Captain Pembroke, how would you like your face on the NYPD website?
Really?
Yes!
Yes!
In exchange for media attention, the Vulture will not bust you down or stand in the way of you two dating.
Sir, I don't know how to thank you.
Anything for the Nine-Nine.
Thank you, sir.
He totally approves of us.
Whatcha doing there, Boyle?
Trying to get drunk enough to have sexual intercourse with a vegan.
Why can't I just think with my junk like a modern man?
Why do you want to do that?
I got divorced, and I was crushed.
My fiancÃ©e left.
I cried for weeks.
My only relationship that wasn't totally devastating when it ended was my casual sex carnival with Gina.
Yeah, okay, But with of those relationships made you happiest before it ended?
My marriage.
Vivian.
Yeah, because you connect with them emotionally, something we did not do because I'm a higher level of being, like Her from the movie "Her".
Dude, you can't go through life trying not to get hurt.
You should try to be happy.
So you think I should look for someone I can have emotional intercourse with.
I wish you hadn't said it like that, but yeah.
And I should start right here at this funeral.
I'd probably wait.
Nope, no time to lose.
Put on your sunglasses.
I need to see if there's anything in my teeth.
Ugh.
Oh, yeah.
Charles Boyle is ready for love.
Well, never wearing these again.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to start clapping, 'cause I just made a major drug bust.
Talking about four kilos of cocaine, $200,000 cash, and my new partner, a tarantula.
I call him Jake Jr., aka Spidey Klum, aka Mrs. Doubtspider, aka Joe Spiden, aka tarantula basset, aka Spi-dermot Mulrooney.
- Aka Tarantulina Jolie.
- What?
No, Charles, have you seen this spider?
- That's a terrible name.
- Sorry.
Why do you have that thing?
Because they were gonna throw him away, but I couldn't do that to my furry little ah!
He's actually really scary up close.
It's horrifying from everywhere.
Terry hates creepy crawlers.
Seriously, I'm not going to your apartment if that thing is there.
All right, fine, then he'll just live here and help me solve crimes.
Get used to him, everyone, 'cause me and this spider are partners for life.
He's gone.
I left the cage unlocked, and he's gone.
Somebody find him!
Stay off the ground!
I'm good.
I'm out of here.
He couldn't have gone far Unless he can fly.
Can tarantulas fly?
Jake, you better find that spider.
And I'm not coming back here until you do.
Uh, Sarge, I think I found it.
Why are you looking at me like that?
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my gosh.
It's on my head!
A whole hour until we testify.
Hey, donut holes.
Don't mind if I do.
Ugh!
Fish?
Fish donuts, Boyle?
What is wrong with you?
It's takoyaki.
I'm drowning my sorrows in octopus balls.
I've been online dating; It's a total disaster.
I've only had one match, and it was a pretty obvious catfish situation.
My name Yennifer.
You give me social security?
Oh, Yennifer Now, I see that as a positive story.
Out of all the identities he could have stolen, he chose yours, and you want to know why?
Because I posted my annual income?
Because you posted your annual income, you moron.
Excuse me, is that takoyaki?
Yeah, from Senka, right down the street.
Oh, I love that place.
The chef lets me take octopus hearts home for my dogs.
Oh, lucky!
How many dogs do you have?
Oh, too many.
Three.
That's how many I have.
Oh.
All right, wait, quick question.
How do you keep them off the bed?
I gave up.
I sleep on the floor.
Me too.
Both: It's better for your back.
Wow.
Well, nice meeting you.
What are you doing?
She's walking away.
I got nervous.
She eats octopus balls, and she sleeps on the floor.
She's the perfect woman.
Oh, my God.
Sorry, I was aiming at somebody else, but now that I have your attention, Charles?
He was aiming at a terrible cwim criminal, he probably saved the world.
Do you want to have tak-takoyaki at the um, on the bench over there?
Sure, I was hoping you'd ask.
My work here is done.
Ugh, still fish.
Oh, God.
Santiago, thank you for coming in.
It's no secret the NYPD has an image problem.
Yeah, when I told my garbage man I was a cop, he said, "gross".
He had someone else's band-aid stuck to him.
Police approval ratings are pardon my language in the commode.
All the headlines are about the bad cops, but there are good cops too, and I want to put up posters that showcase some of our best.
I'd like you to be on the first one.
Shut up, Ray.
I mean, interesting, Captain.
I'll think about it.
Wow, this is a bad idea.
First off, Amy has an epic lack of swagger.
Uh, I'll have you know I have swagger.
I ooze swagger.
Right.
More importantly, putting up a bunch of photos of smiling cops isn't gonna change how people feel about us.
I think this campaign is very promising.
Santiago, what's your take?
Oh, right, let's hear an unbiased opinion from your straight-up swimfan.
I think it's a great idea, sir.
Well, you can count me out.
I will not pose for your posters.
I didn't ask you, and you're not a police officer.
Yeah, I'm out.
Sarge, permission to arrest Hitchcock and Scully.
I told you before, it's not harassment unless you can prove intent to fart.
No, it's not that.
They robbed me.
They ate my Moose Tracks ice cream.
That's funny.
I wouldn't think you like Moose Tracks.
My boyfriend Marcus introduced me to it.
-  - What?
It is a delicious treat for all ages.
Damn, Rosa, okay.
Look, I think they've been skimming people's desserts for weeks, but I can never prove it.
Did you see them take your ice cream?
No, but Hitchcock has fudge stains all over his chest.
He's always got fudge stains all over his chest.
- Ugh.
- They'll deny everything.
We need hard proof.
So let's get it.
Step one: Put a delicious pie in the fridge and cover it with poison.
That's step one?
What's step two?
Tell their widows they were thieves.
Hey, where'd she go?
You guys were hitting it off.
I half expected to see you sitting in her lap by now.
She is amazing.
Her palate is wide and deep.
Gross.
And at one point when she wasn't looking, I snuck a whiff of her hair.
Of course you did.
She uses one of my top three shampoos: Tahitian coconut, extra lather.
Sounds good, Boyle.
- Did you get her number?
- Oh, we lost track of time.
She had to go back into court.
When she's done, I'm gonna ask her out.
Oh, okay, okay.
So what's the plan?
Going straight from here to the spa.
Couples massage.
Okay, seems a little intense, but given how your other weirdness lined up, I say go for it.
Oh, here she comes.
Oh, okay.
How do I look?
You look great.
I've got a good feeling about this.
Genevieve, I know we just met, and I don't want to be too forward Charles.
But sometimes you just get a feeling about a person.
Charles.
And I've got that feeling about you.
I like you Charles, look down.
I think tonight we oh, shoot.
They just gave me ten years in prison.
She didn't say no.
Hey, buddy.
Got you some of those fish donuts you like so much to cheer you up.
Although, full disclosure, I couldn't find where they sold them, so that's just a chocolate Ã©clair with lox on it.
Oh, thanks, Jake, but I don't need cheering up.
You can eat it yourself.
Nope.
So what, you're not upset about falling hard for a lady who was immediately thrown in jail?
No, because she's not actually guilty.
They say she robbed her own art gallery for the insurance money, but that makes no sense.
She would have made more if the art had sold.
This piece, "breastfeeding knight," was worth twice what she got from the insurance company.
Wow, look at that.
Not to sound overly intellectual, but dem knight boobies is crazy.
I get art.
Also, I talked to Genevieve's lawyer.
He's a total disaster.
I have a couple questions about a beautiful client of yours, Genevieve Mirren-Carter.
She got hit by a tow truck and sued the driver?
No, she was accused of insurance fraud.
Oh, good, because I blew that tow truck case.
Straight-up forgot to go to court.
Well, they found one of the stolen paintings at her house.
But she said she didn't know how it ended up there.
- She's being set up.
- Framed.
Art joke.
Continue.
My hunch is that it's a jealous ex-lover.
A girl like that, three dogs, makes her own turkey stock, that's the kind of woman you don't get over.
Look, I know you think my judgment's clouded because I like her a little bit You doodled your wedding invitation.
No, that's our joint tombstone.
My mistake.
But as a cop, I really don't think that she did it.
Something is off about the case.
Okay, Boyle.
I trust your gut.
Let's go free an innocent woman.
Nice!
My dreams are coming true.
You and me getting my lady off together.
I mean, you know how that sounds, right?
Look strong but fair.
But approachable.
But professional.
And fun.
But not too fun.
This is your job.
Can you handle all that?
Sir, "fun but not too fun" was my campaign slogan when I ran for prom queen.
Did you win?
No.
Ames?
I want to say you look great.
Thank you.
You didn't let me finish.
Dot, dot, dot, for you.
Great news is, it doesn't matter, because this campaign, like three out of five Backstreet Boys, is inconsequential.
That's enough, Gina.
All I'm saying as a if not the voice of the streets is, this tisn't gonna work.
And all I'm saying as a if not the boss here is, if you're not gonna support me, you can leave.
Fine.
I will leave.
I'm gonna go get a mani-pedi, and I'm gonna do some serious subtweeting, so you might want to  Keep off the net.
Diaz.
Look what I found in Hitchcock and Scully's trash can: Ice cream spoon.
Son of a bitch.
You hungry, hungry hippos ate my ice cream.
Why was this in your trash?
And who throws away a spoon?
It's the easiest utensil to clean.
I don't even think it's ice cream.
It's probably medicine.
You know, I'm on lots of medicines, rosa.
I'm sick all over.
This is ice cream, and I'm gonna prove it.
Sarge, no.
It's been in their mouths.
What am I doing?
Well, I guess your little investigation has hit a dead end.
I'll be back.
Don't move.
Not a problem.
I hate moving.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Interesting.
Yeah, something definitely doesn't add up.
Did you know there's a sausage you can drink?
What?
Are you even talking about the case?
We got distracted.
She has an amazing tongue.
Strong, supple, great bud density.
Okay, I'm gonna take over the questioning.
Yeah, I'm too close to this.
Disgusting eating habits.
Hi, Genevieve.
I'm just gonna ask you a couple of questions now, and Detective Boyle will just sit there and keep waving at you, I guess.
Now then, is there anybody you can think of besides yourself that has access to the gallery after hours?
No, just me, and the vault is only accessible through fingerprint ID.
Does Charles have a girlfriend?
I just saw her mouth my name.
What did she say?
Is she asking if I'm circumcised?
What?
No.
Who asks that?
Stop interrupting.
Sorry about that.
Okay, next question.
Can you think of anyone that might be trying to set you up?
Maybe an employee or a rival of some kind?
Maybe my ex-boyfriend Nick.
He's an artist, a terrible one.
He was always in debt and begging for money.
That's why we broke up.
Maybe he's resentful.
Dirtbag ex.
Oh, that was my theory, remember?
Tell her it was my theory.
- Okay.
- Wait, give me a second.
I want to look smart when you say it.
Okay.
Uh, hey, Genevieve, Detective Boyle wanted me to let you know that he, a college graduate, had a similar theory that it could have been an ex-boyfriend.
Wow.
He is so smart.
Wow, it actually worked.
I've got to hand it to you, buddy whatever you're putting down, she is picking up.
Oh, good.
Oh, one more thing.
Boyle has another question.
Tell her when this is all over, I'm gonna rub her body in pÃ¢tÃ©, and then rub it off her with a cornichon.
I'm just gonna give the phone back.
Okay.
Hi.
Guard got nauseous, so we had to stop.
Hmm, that's weird.
Do you think it's because you're the two most disgusting people in the universe?
- Could be.
- Yeah, check this out.
Remember the ex-boyfriend that she mentioned, Nick?
Call him Mr. Butthead.
Okay, well, apparently Mr. Butthead just bought a brand-new gallery in Dumbo to showcase his art, which is weird, because Genevieve said he was always in debt.
Looks like somebody just came into a ton of money.
Oh, and you think she's gonna want to get back together with him now that he's rich.
- Damn it!
- No, Boyle.
He probably got the cash from selling the stolen art.
Your hunch was right.
Yeah, it was.
my hunch, my hunch, my lovely case-y hunch Come on, Jake, sing with me.
That's not gonna happen.
I will literally never whatcha gonna do with all that hunch all that hunch inside your brain Both: we're gonna solve, solve, solve this case solve this case right in your face We should probably leave this prison.
Yep.
Okay, here's my cover.
My name is Sherwin Lemonde, sculptor, painter, full-time barista.
But once I sell my first piece, part-time barista.
Oh, nice.
I'm Donald Hoberman-Seitz.
I wear glasses.
Is that all you got?
Sorry, I spent the cab ride here imagining me and Genevieve kissing.
Okay, just let me do the talking.
Wine?
Yes, thank you so much.
Oh, wow, I love your outfit.
I'm an artist, so I get that it's more than just tight.
Nick likes to coat women in latex.
He's fascinated by the idea of the human chrysalis in society's pupation.
Hmm, cool.
Human chrysalis and whatnot.
Yeah, whatnot.
It's a whatnot.
Yeah, yeah.
I have no idea what a chrysalis is, but serious question: If she farts in that thing, does it blow up like a balloon?
You have to assume that it would.
You have to, right?
- Yeah.
- Art is so intense.
It really is.
Look, there's Nick.
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
- Is this your work?
- Yes.
It's good.
I haven't talked to anyone here, but it almost seems like you're going for a human chrysalis thing.
I'm glad you like it.
I wish I could take credit, but this is society.
I'm just holding up the mirror.
Hmm?
Wow.
You meant that literally.
Very cool.
Anyhow, I'm a fellow artist named Sherwin.
I'm Donald Hoberman-Seitz.
I wear glasses.
So anyway, I was wondering.
How'd you get your own gallery?
It must be really expensive.
Art's not about the money, man.
Totally.
It's more about the other things.
Right on.
This painting is called "Genevieve 416".
What's that all about?
Well, April 16th was the day my ex, Genevieve, and I covered ourselves with paint and made love on that canvas for 24 hours straight.
That's pretty pathetic, dude.
You seem pretty obsessed with Genevieve, huh?
- Excuse me?
- Donald.
I bet it really hurt when she dumped you.
- What?
- Donald, your glasses.
Where were you July 21st, Mr. Butthead?
Uh  Uh, duh, uh You were robbing Genevieve's gallery.
You framed her, and I should arrest you right now.
- What are you, cops?
- What?
No, we're artists.
And as artists, we question everything, including certain people's whereabouts on particular dates.
Get out of here.
Fine, but we're taking this, because you don't deserve that memory.
That painting is $95,000.
I don't want it anyway.
Your penis was on it.
Sorry about that.
Donald is Sucks.
Hey, you dum-dums.
Ice cream.
Moose tracks ice cream.
How do you know?
Yep, it's definitely ice cream.
- Knew it!
- They're going down.
Also, whoever used this spoon, their body ain't right.
Okay, let's say it is ice cream.
But I didn't eat it; I couldn't have.
I'm lactose intolerant.
Me too.
I'm super lactose intolerant.
You're lying.
Have you ever seen us eat dairy?
You know no one can bear to watch you eat.
Check.
And Check.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
I got to say, Boyle.
Nick was pretty defensive.
Yeah, and he's a terrible artist.
All he does is have sex on canvases.
Any fourth grader could do that.
But They shouldn't.
No.
Hey, Nick doesn't like cops, but he didn't do anything wrong.
And how would you know?
I'm his assistant, Dvora.
He would never set up Genevieve.
He's still in love with her.
He keeps boxes of her old stuff lying around.
Ooh, can we look at, smell, and handle them?
I mean, you know, for the investigation.
We're cops.
Please, take the boxes.
I want them out of here.
Oh, okay, great.
You wouldn't happen to know where he was on July 21st, would you?
Actually, I would.
He did a performance art piece that entire month.
He lived in a cage on the street and never left it.
The whole thing's on video.
Okay, great.
Totally.
We'll just go around back and pick up the boxes.
Oh, one more thing.
Where in this "cage" did he go to the bathroom?
- Bucket.
- Okay, gross.
Have a good night.
Sir, I saw my poster on the subway this morning.
Well, you must feel like a celebrity, a regular Ira Glass.
They put a Hitler mustache on me.
Yes, this is unfortunate, but let's not overreact to one graffito.
It wasn't just one.
People drew on every single poster.
They put devil horns, target on my face, this one says, "die pig," and worst of all, they didn't put the comma between "die" and "pig".
This is easily dealt with.
I'll just issue a statement saying vandals will be prosecuted.
It's not just vandalism, sir.
People have real complaints too.
"End stop and frisks.
"Stop racial profiling.
Unlawful arrest is a crime".
I see.
I think Gina was right about the campaign, sir.
Hmm.
I'm surprised she hasn't marched in here to say, "I told you so".
She wouldn't do that.
You're right, Amy.
For once in your life, you're 100% right.
I would never say that.
Did you have enough time to read it all?
Yes.
Okay, good.
Yep, it's true.
He sat in a cage for a month.
Eww, the bucket checks out.
This is insane.
Anything is art.
Here, watch this.
A statue of Jesus made out of cigarette butts.
Boom, I'm a millionaire.
- That's actually pretty good.
- I know.
And I I could call it "holy smokes".
Should we really do this?
No, right?
That's crazy; You can't just become an artist out of nowhere.
- Jake.
- What?
- The case.
- Yeah.
So Nick has an alibi; That's not great.
But we have a box of Genevieve's stuff from the gallery.
I'm sure there's something in here that will exonerate her.
- Right.
- Oh, my God.
Socks and shoes.
This is exactly the type of stuff I own.
This is kismet.
Oh, no, what's this?
It's a receipt for a storage unit that she didn't tell anyone about.
- It's probably nothing.
- Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Yeah.
- It's totally nothing.
- No.
It's a bunch of stolen art.
Hey, buddy.
Sorry about Genevieve.
It's okay.
I'm resigned to my life of solitude.
Just me and my five dogs.
Wait, I thought you only had three dogs.
I just adopted two online right now.
Oh, this pit bull hates kids.
That's fine; I'll never have any.
Add to cart.
Okay, let me just grab that.
Listen to me, Charles.
You're gonna be fine.
There are plenty of women out there.
Strong, beautiful, smart women.
How about her?
She's very beautiful.
With my luck, she's probably a car thief.
Don't be ridiculous.
- Hey, Scully.
- Yeah?
Who's the babe?
Just booked her for elder abuse.
Elder abuse, that's nice.
All right, fine.
We shouldn't be doing this at a precinct.
I really thought I was gonna get Genevieve out of prison.
Then we'd cover ourselves in paint and make love for 25 hours, one more hour than her and Nick.
Boyle, you would hate that.
Your little hummingbird heart would explode.
I wish I didn't have a heart.
I'm off to the cheese shop And I'm buying by the wheel.
- The cheese wheel.
- Yeah, I got it.
Gina, as you predicted, there was some backlash to the poster campaign.
Yes, I'm the Nostradamus of your shame.
I think a problem the police have had is our inability to admit our mistakes, so this campaign was, um A mistake.
You told me that, but I got defensive and didn't listen.
I should have been open to criticism, as this department should be open to criticism.
That's why I'm replacing these with These.
My email address is at the bottom, and I intend to respond to every message I receive.
Before we put them up, I want to hear your thoughts.
I love them.
Once again, my advice has, like, saved the city.
I came up with the slogan.
It's tacky to take credit for stuff.
We're here to apologize.
I can't prove you took my Moose Tracks, so I shouldn't have yelled at you.
I'm impressed.
It takes a big person to admit when they're being a total dum-dum.
We want to make it up to you.
We got you a pizza.
Only one pizza for both of us?
Oh, my God.
That was an obvious setup, you morons.
You're eating cheese.
You're lying about being lactose intolerant.
No, we weren't.
Some things are just delicious enough to suffer the consequences.
I'm diabetic, but I still eat sugar out of the bag.
Both: Ugh!
Just admit you took my Moose Tracks.
Admit it!
Admit It.
Yeah, we ate it.
And we're eating your pizza.
So who's the moron now?
Ooh, stomach.
Oh, yeah.
It's coming.
They admitted it.
That's a victory, right?
No, Terry.
There are no winners here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Coming through, coming through!
Move it!
Move, move, move, move, move, move, move!
Getting in a little late there this morning, Boyle.
Where you been?
Cursing out my own shadow for hanging out with a loser like me.
Also an eye doctor appointment.
Well, there's something in the holding cell that might cheer you up.
That's Nick's assistant.
Why is she here?
After you left last night, I was thinking about the 24-hour sex painting, "Genevieve 416".
Check out the date on this receipt from the storage locker with the stolen art.
April 16th.
Exactly.
She couldn't have rented it, because she was busy getting busy.
Oh, good one.
This is fantastic.
I mean, I'm not happy that she was having sex with another man, but I'm okay with it if that's what gets her off.
Do you seriously not hear it, because it almost seems intentional at this point.
Why would Dvora set Genevieve up?
Because she's in love with Nick.
She used one of those latex casts of Genevieve's hand to get the fingerprints so she could break into the gallery.
Wow, I can't believe you kept working the case even after I gave up.
That was a nice thing to do.
Charles, I didn't do it to be nice.
I did it to be amazing.
And I think you're a great detective, and I trusted your gut.
Go get your girlfriend out of prison.
Oh, thanks, man.
Next time you see me, I'm gonna be all out of orgasms.
No, you can't say that while you're hugging someone.
Not a doctor.
Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
All right, ladies, I don't got a whole lot of time here, so what do you say we make like Boyle's mom and you debrief me?
Didn't happen, and I should know.
She tells me everything.
Yeah, not everything, Chucky.
She took off my undies.
Hey, Peralta.
What is that?
- This?
- Yeah.
Oh, nothing.
Just open-and-shut case.
Well, it looks like a pretty fat file for a dunker.
What is it?
Just some old lady has a missing torso that we can't find.
Put it in the major crimes pile.
But we've already given them all of our felonies.
It's because I got a bet going with the captain of the A4 to see whose squad can solve the most cases.
Winner gets to choose a tattoo for the loser, and guess what I'm getting him.
Calvin peeing on the Tasmanian Devil?
No, it's supposed to be a bad tattoo.
Man, you're really stupid in the morning, aren't you?
Captain, we all want you to win that bet, but do you think maybe we could keep a few real cases?
Look, I'm gonna keep it real simple for you.
We only solve misdemeanors, wieners.
Say it.
We only solve misdemeanors Wieners.
Congratulations.
You just called yourselves wieners.
Dismissed.
Good morning.
For whom?
For you-m.
Okay, I can't keep lying.
Wuntch is here.
Oh, there it is.
The shriveled husk of Raymond Holt.
Look, Gina, is that a talking raisin?
Enough foreplay.
I'm here to discuss the department's new smuggling task force.
The task force?
Oh, I thought you'd be handing me another vapid PR assignment.
I am.
We need to choose a phrase to replace the phrase "task force".
Our research suggests it's too aggressive.
What?
I like it.
Task force sounds like some sort of body spray for hot dudes.
Oh, and, um, one more thing.
Since your little stunt with the subway poster, I think you could use some supervision.
Bob will be keeping an eye on you.
It's gonna be fun, Ray.
But I'm his boss.
Oh, ouch.
How demeaning.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
Sarge, you got to check this out.
Jake, what are you doing?
We can't work real cases.
This is a B and E. Oh, it's so much more than that.
Look at these photos.
Perp came in through the back window, set up the living room to look like a kid's tea party, didn't steal anything.
Do you know what this means?
The victim still has their stuff?
The perp wasn't there to take anything except lives.
Sorry, I always wanted to say that.
I think this is the work of the Oolong Slayer.
Seems like a stretch.
If this is the Oolong Slayer, why isn't there a body?
I don't know, maybe he got spooked before the Vic got home, or it could be Jake, you want a case so bad, you're making one up.
Look, the slayer hasn't struck in five years.
Chief Garmin set up a task force to find the guy and turned up nothing, and most importantly, the vulture's orders were only misdemeanors, wieners.
Why do you follow people's directions when you could literally pick them up and throw them out the window?
Hmm?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Was that the sound of a juicy file I heard plopping down on Peralta's desk?
Yeah, it was.
You just lost your overtime privileges for the month.
Everybody, listen up.
Anyone caught working on a case that I didn't assign loses their overtime.
Capooch?
Capooch.
Capooch.
Uncapooch.
You didn't say "no take backs".
Ah, there you are.
I got something real special for the two of you.
Great, what do you got?
A month from today is my birthday.
I need you to throw me a party, all right?
Make it epic, surprise me.
Are you asking us to plan you a birthday party?
Yeah, Helen Keller.
Pay attention.
Did you choose us because we're women?
Women love planning parties.
It's in the Bible.
Unbelievable.
What a waste of time.
Disagree.
This is an amazing use of time.
We have complete control over that dummy's birthday party.
We can ruin it.
Yeah, fun.
I'll just mess up a captain's orders on purpose.
It'll be so I can't even fake it.
Yeah, baby, I can pick up the crib, right after I get the groceries and before I start painting the nursery.
Yeah, I can draw a cloud.
I don't need a stencil.
Okay, I'll get the stencil.
Look, I don't know when I'll be home.
I'll text you, okay?
Ugh, all this paperwork is gonna straight-up kill me.
How are you so chipper?
Oh, simple.
I eat a cacao nib every time I close a case.
A what?
A cacao nib.
They're these happy little chocolaty delights from deep in the Peruvian rain forest.
Here, try one.
Do I look like a man who snacks?
You look like eight circles with suspenders on.
But these aren't bad for you.
They're full of fiber and antioxidants.
Go ahead, try one.
Okay, fine.
Just one.
Mm-hmm.
Damn, these are good.
And plus, they're organic and fair trade.
Terry loves responsible agricultural practices.
Mmm.
Uh-oh.
Jake, you should not be here IRL.
Gina, my old friend who I grew up with.
So good to see you, and I have missed you so much.
Is Holt in?
Yes, of course he is, but he's in a meeting, and you can not be seen stopping by for chits and/or chats.
You need to leave.
Gina, I'm not here to waste his time, all right?
I have an extremely dope, possibly even disgusting case, and I need to discuss it with him.
A case?
Extra no.
If Wuntch finds out he's working on a case, she will punish him.
She's on the warpath right now, Jake.
The warpath.
Okay, copy that.
Loud and clear.
Don't want to cause a problem.
I will skraight-up skedaddle with no further a-do-do.
What's going on?
Well, Gina said we couldn't be seen together, and I need your help.
Looks like we've both got a pretty bad case of jerk boss.
Yes, yours is an idiot, and mine is a fork-tongued lizard witch.
The Oolong Slayer.
He's back.
I knew you would confirm my hunch.
He's back to his cool-ass psycho ways.
Great news, right?
Aside from a serial killer being on the loose.
What's your plan?
I'm gonna work the case in secret.
Wrong.
We're gonna work the case in secret.
Holy crap.
No one can know about this, understood?
Understood.
Understood.
What?
I hang out in the men's room all the time.
The acoustics are amazing If I recall correctly, the Oolong Slayer last struck five years ago.
He left behind no DNA or fingerprints, but he did leave his calling card, a tea bag in his victim's mouth.
Yeah, how cool I mean awful is that?
Very cool I mean awful.
What's our strategy?
One, reexamine all the task force's files, two, check all B and Es against the slayer's MO, and three, think of something supercool to say when we arrest him.
My leading contender?
"You're going to jail for oolong time".
- Jake, that's really good.
- Right?
Let's not overlook the fact that he turned his crime scenes into tea parties for dollies.
Which suggests preadolescent trauma leading to a pattern of criminality that probably began as a juvenile.
I'm taking an abnormal psych class, and everyone in it is obsessed with me.
You look into the B and Es and I'll check out the juvie angle.
Now, before we begin in earnest, I'd like to propose a toast.
That's what globes are for.
A 25-year-old port seems appropriate.
I would have gone 10.
I don't know what port is.
To catching a serial killer.
To catching a serial killer.
To Rihanna, because I love Rihanna.
Okay.
Case closed.
What time is it?
That's right, it's nib o'clock.
Whoo, new case, new nib.
Read 20 words, that's a nib.
Hmm, that nib was kind of small.
Hey, sarge?
You may want to slow down on those things.
Things?
These are the precious jewels of the rain forest, Boyle.
I don't mean to overstep here, but you're looking a little fat.
Oh, boy.
How dare you?
You can't comment on my body.
This is a workplace.
Now I'm feeling objectified by your male gaze.
Absolutely not.
Sir, just listen.
No, I don't want to listen, Boyle.
You are trying to shame me, and that will not fly.
Okay.
Now I need some more nibs just to calm down.
- Jake, dope alley.
- I know.
I think this is where Batman's parents got killed.
I'll take your word for it.
The juvie angle didn't pan out.
Neither did the B and Es, but I traced the label on the slayer's oolong.
Turns out he got it at Chang's Medicinal Tea Shop.
Good work, Peralta.
Breakthrough selfie?
Why not?
Breakthrough.
So what's the plan, boss?
We create a diversion while Gina copies his customer files.
My thumb drive looks like a watermelon, because I adore the summertime.
Oh, I love that.
Let's do this.
Oh, hey, pal, that's my ginkgo.
It's my ginkgo now, old man.
I'm still young enough to beat that ginkgo out of your hands.
Hey, knock it off back there.
This is so much fun.
Hit me in the face.
Oh, that was a terrible suggestion.
Oh.
All right.
Western medicine rules!
All right, sluggers.
Let's see what you got for the big b-day bash.
I thought you wanted us to surprise you.
It's a figure of speech, Detective Stupid-ago.
Well, I was thinking a DJ, two signature cocktails, passed hors d'oeuvres Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Passed hors d'oeuvres?
What is this, a fundraiser for French dorks?
So no passed hors d'oeuvres?
I can't even answer that.
All right, tough guy.
What do you got planned?
I don't know.
Meet at a bar and drink there.
That's it?
Well, it's still better than Santiago's.
Look, this is real important to me, all right?
My brother's hot wife is gonna be there, and I haven't seen her since his funeral.
- Wow.
- Yeah, right?
I mean, you only get one shot at your brother's widow.
Just go.
Oh.
- Partner.
- Partner.
Not many people buy that tea, and only one has been doing so since the killings first began, and he has a record.
His name?
Braxton O'Reilly.
He's a maniac.
Arrested in '84 for torturing an animal?
Oh, this is our guy.
Oh, man, just a squirrel?
Still counts.
Let's get that psycho.
NYPD, nobody move.
Where is Braxton O'Reilly?
Where is that psycho monster?
He's dead.
Our condolences.
You were working a case.
I freaking knew it.
- You're a liar.
- And you.
You can't do anything except disobey orders and screw up.
I'm disappointed too.
No one cares, Bob.
And after all your so-called detective work, you didn't even get the right guy.
Raymond, Raymond, Raymond - It was an error, but - Do not interrupt me.
Raymond, Raymond, Raymond, Raymond.
Seven times, once for every day your juicy, insubordinate ass is suspended.
Same goes for you, Peralta.
Except for the juicy ass part, because your ass is stupid.
Now get the hell out of my office.
Wait a minute, sir.
You know what.
Screw this.
It's ten days now.
Shouldn't have gone back in.
I am skraight-up depressed.
Amy's been doing her best to cheer me up.
She gave me this sticker this morning just for waking up.
Ew, it's like you're dating your teacher.
I know.
It's so hot.
Meanwhile, Holt won't even talk to me.
How is he, by the way?
Honestly, terrible.
I've only heard from him once this week, and that was to tell me he'd finally come up with a new, non-threatening term for task forces.
Ya'll ready for this?
Do groups.
Wow, that sucks tremendously.
Can I have another port?
You're still drinking that stuff?
Yeah, Holt got me hooked on it.
I even got a bottle for my house.
It's really classing up the booze and take-out menus shelf.
Wait a minute.
I think I just figured something out.
I got to go.
Aren't you forgetting something?
Uh No, pay your bill.
Damn, who raised you?
Oh, my God.
You friended the vulture?
Well, he's not telling us anything, so it was the only way to figure out what he likes.
Maybe this will help.
He just said his favorite color is underboob.
Look, Amy, you're a good detective.
You don't have to perfectly plan some butthead's birthday party.
I'm sorry, but I believe that hard work pays off.
- Shut up.
- Excuse me?
No, no, no, shut up and look.
You're completely right.
Your hard work just paid off.
The vulture is in a band?
Fantastic Jack and the Junkyard Rats.
Just when I thought he couldn't be any more the worst, he out-the worsts himself.
I have an idea.
I don't know why you insisted on eating here, Gina.
It seems like your average greasy spoon.
Pardon me.
Did one of you order the hot plate of justice?
Peralta, what are you doing here?
Saving New York City from a maniacal Um, excuse me?
Are those my eggs?
You kind of interrupted an incredible moment, but here, take that.
No, no, we can't be seen together.
Gina, did you know about this?
Uh, tricking you was the only way I could get you to talk to him.
Plus, you know I heart intrigue.
Sir, take a look at these photos.
None of the victims had any alcohol in their apartments.
Not even a dusty bottle.
You want to know why?
Because they were all sober.
They all attended None of them the same one, but they all have the same leader, a creep with a record of torturing animals.
I'm talking dogs.
I found the Oolong Slayer, and his name is I never do this, but I kind of ordered rye.
Ma'am, I'm not a waiter, okay?
I'm trying to blow my friend's mind over here.
Could someone get this lunatic some rye?
His name is James Dylan Borden, and he works the night shift at creep-a-palooza the mannequin factory in Red Hook.
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
Are you insane?
We were just suspended for screwing up this case.
I shouldn't even be talking to you.
Wuntch can probably hear us right now.
She has super sonar hearing, because she's a bat.
Sir, we're tracking a serial killer.
There's nothing better.
We're living the dream.
That's your dream.
Mine was to run the nine-nine, and that will never happen again.
Just give the case to major crimes.
Wow.
Never thought I'd live to see Holt side with the vulture and Wuntch.
Mark the day, Gina.
May 18th at 4:00 p.m. Oh, honey.
We're well into October.
Really?
Hey, Charles.
I thought you should know.
I heard what you said, and it really sank in.
I'm off the nibs.
- Really?
- Of course.
I'm Terry Jeffords, and when I put my mind to something, I do it.
My resting heart rate is six.
Six, Boyle.
You know, the rest of you could learn a little something from me.
Sure, sometimes we fall down, but it's how we back up that matters.
We need to look our failings in the eye and say, "Not today, not today, nibs".
Oh, sergeant.
Fine!
I'm not better.
These nibs are just too damn delicious.
I don't think the nibs being too yummy is the problem.
I think right now, there's too much on your plate metaphor intended.
You're stress eating.
That's even worse!
The stress isn't going anywhere.
I'm about to have my third kid, and they just get more stressful over time, man.
Oh, nibs, what am I gonna do?
Help me.
Huh.
Why would a psycho want to work here?
Got you.
Looking for me?
Nope, just taking my gun for a walk through the nightmares factory.
Nice try, cop.
But you and I are gonna have a little tea party.
Am I invited?
Drop the weapon.
Okay, slayer.
Prepare to go to jail for oolong time.
Now say "punk".
Punk.
Punk!
I said it.
Thank you, Peralta.
What are you thanking me for?
You're the one who showed up and stopped him from shooting me in my beautiful face.
No, for giving me one last chance to be a real cop before going back to a lifetime of PR drivel.
Sir, we just caught a serial killer.
I've wanted this since I was four years old.
That's troubling.
We did something special here.
I'm honored our names will appear next to each other on the arrest report.
No, no.
I think you should take sole credit.
Wuntch will only use it to sink me.
I'm glad your dream came true, Peralta.
Now, if you'll excuse me, the drivel calls.
Hey, turd monkeys.
It's time to celebrate me.
Let's rock!
Whoo!
His tearaway pants just got stuck.
Hiring him to play his own party is straight-up brilliant.
Yep, because everything he does is a prank on himself.
Wow, you're an evil genius.
Next time I want to hurt someone, I'm coming straight to you.
Aw, that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
All right, this next song is called "Moms in the Shower".
Sarge, I know you have every right to be stressed out.
A new kid on the way, Sharon's on bed rest, global warming This preamble is making me nibby.
Get to the point.
I got the squad to volunteer a little bit of their off time to help you and your family out.
I'll make dinner once a week, everyone else volunteered babysitting time, and Hitchcock offered massage sessions for your wife - What?
- So I pepper sprayed him.
You're a good man, Charles.
How can I ever thank you?
Start taking care of yourself again.
I miss those gross, overly large muscles.
Lay off my body, dude.
I clearly got some stuff to work through.
Chief Garmin, thanks for meeting with me.
So I have a guy in custody on an attempted B and E. You scheduled a meeting with the chief of detectives to tell me that?
I did.
Oh, I should probably also mention, he's the Oolong Slayer, and this is every bit of evidence you'll need to put him away for good.
Really?
Yeah.
- Wow.
- Right?
I spent a decade looking for this monster, and you found him all on your own.
Yeah, pretty easily, actually.
I imagine that'll look pretty bad for you.
Excuse me?
Unless, of course, I decided to withhold that information, keep it just for myself as a secret.
Tell everyone it was you who figured it out.
Why would you do that?
What do you want?
Your own do group?
No, I actually had something else in mind.
Captain Holt?
This can't be real.
Someone please see him before I punch myself in the face.
Hello, squad.
Oh, my God.
Captain?
Good news.
The vulture is out, and I'm back.
- Yes.
- That's good.
Glad you're back, captain.
We really missed you.
How'd you get them to reinstate you?
I didn't.
I guess someone just had my back.
Wait, where's Gina?
She wanted to make a proper entrance.
Or was I never really gone?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Good morning, Boyle.
It's Halloween I'm surprised you didn't put on a costume.
I was going to, sir, but then I decided, "screw that jazz".
Well, I'm the only one who ever dresses up, no one ever gets my costume, and they make fun of me so I'm done.
These people don't deserve my dress-up gifts.
Charles, seriously?
No costume?
What the hell, Charles?
Where's your Halloween spirit?
But you guys always make fun of me.
I have never once insulted you in my life, especially vis-Ã -vis your appearance.
Yeah, man, we always love your costumes.
Remember last year, when you came as that person and/or thing?
Yes, I do remember!
Sir, permission to sprint to my car and get my emergency costume?
Does it matter if I say no?
No!
A-bam, bam, boom.
What the what Why are you dressed up?
You look like an idiot.
But but Yeah, what are you supposed to be, a sassy car mechanic?
No, come on he's clearly the rejected Pop-Tarts mascot, Harry Pop-Tart.
I am not!
You know who I am!
Squad, that's enough you're making Boyle feel bad on purpose.
- He's Elvis.
- Yes!
Elvis Stojko, the Canadian figure skater.
No!
Attention, squad: today is the most important day in the history of this precinct.
For today is Halloween I thought we were going to say it together.
- I never agreed to that.
- All right.
As you may know, for the past two years, Captain Holt and I have engaged in an epic battle of wits.
The goal: to determine who must call the other an amazing detective/genius.
The first year, by sheer, dumb luck, Jake eked out a feeble victory.
And last year, I let the captain win, because he's old an sad.
Sad because the competition was so dismal.
Is this meeting about something?
It's about everything.
This year's the tie-breaker, a final heist to decide once and for all the true king of the nine-nine.
Halloween Heist  The Heistening.
Tagline?
This year we both attempt to steal the same object instead of Jake attempting to steal one from me.
I gave you one direction on the tagline snappy.
But yes, we will be attempting to steal the same item this.
The crown will be locked in this briefcase, which in turn will be locked in the interrogation room.
And so unto the briefcase goes the crown Didn't sing it with me.
We will need help, so to be fair, we're holding a draft.
The captain and I have given up our overtime, so everyone who participates will get the night off captain?
With the first pick of the draft, I choose Terry.
Okay, brawns over brains.
All right, I take Charles.
I get it.
Close friend.
- I pick Gina.
- Gina?
I take Rosa.
What?
Okay, all right.
Well, Captain that leaves me with you.
- Let's do this.
- Hang on, Santiago.
I'm not sure I can trust you.
You're Peralta's paramour; maybe you should be on his team.
No, no, no Amy would do anything to win your approval, including pretending to be in a relationship with me for the past few weeks only to betray me now.
Jake, you are majorly overthinking this.
Maybe, but it's a risk I'm not willing to take.
- You're not on my team, Amy.
- Yeah, Amy's out.
By midnight, whoever has the crown will be the king of the nine-nine.
Uh, Hitchcock and I still haven't been chosen.
- I'm good.
- Me too.
So, I see you've been assigned to guard the briefcase too.
Yup, I'm not supposed to let it or you out of my sight, if that even is you.
Ow, that's my face!
Oh, sorry I thought it was a cheap, rubber mask.
Well, I have exciting news.
I found the perfect guy to set you up with.
After zero consideration, I'm happy to say, "hard pass".
Come on, our parents are married.
Genevieve and I are dating.
I want you to have someone too.
You shouldn't have to slow-dance alone after family dinner.
How did my life come to this?
Charles, it's very sweet that you want to set me up with someone, but I do not trust your taste in guys at all.
I have spectacular taste in men.
You would love Nadia.
His name is Nadia?
Oh, all of a sudden Nadia's not a cool name?
You are impossible.
- Here, got it?
- Got it.
Hey, Jake.
Can we talk?
Yeah.
You really hurt my feelings by leaving me off your team.
Oh, I had no idea you felt that way.
Well, it doesn't feel great to be left out.
Right, totally, I get it.
I'm sorry Captain Holt!
What?
Why are you yelling at my boobs?
Because that's where the camera is.
Nice try, Ray-Ray!
There's no camera, Jake.
I was being serious.
Okay fine if you're telling the truth, then I sincerely apologize.
But since you're not, I will defeat you!
Ahhh!
Gah!
Scary witch!
Scary, so scary!
Amy, don't feel bad.
You can get in on my bet with Scully.
At midnight tonight, we will steal his foot fungus cream.
Thanks, that's very kind of you to include me, but I'll have to pass.
The mind games have already begun.
- No, I'm not part of this.
- Oh, of course not.
Neither am I. Wink.
Ugh.
I'm not going to meet my next boyfriend through a Charles set-up.
I'm going to meet him in an illegal dance competition in an abandoned subway tunnel.
It's go time, Boyle.
Holt and Terry have closed the blinds release the roaches.
Alternately, he could win an illegal street race in which my love is the prize.
Oh, my God!
Gina, look!
Roaches!
Look!
Ew, Charles, kill them with whatever cologne you're wearing!
No, I can't!
They're moving too fast!
I can't kill them!
It's pandemonium!
If I die, turn my Tweets into a book!
Commence operation, "Oh crap, wrong vent".
Oh crap, wrong vent.
This was a mistake.
Nice try, losers.
You blew it.
Yeah, we totally blew it.
And all because Boyle marked the wrong vent.
It's not my fault I thought it was the right vent.
- Unbelievable, mister.
- You are, mister.
I'm having trouble even believing you at all right now.
That is the last time I let Charles mark a vent.
I'm normally great at marking vents.
Lock picked.
Never, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever, will I ever, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, never, never, never I forgive you, and good-bye.
Wow, you should have seen us, Rosa.
Charles and I were amazing.
I somersaulted through a window, cut the crown out of a briefcase, and replaced everything in under a minute.
Yeah, I guess you helped a little.
But our fake argument was super convincing.
And all of a sudden, we had to make it longer, and we did.
Anyways, now all we gotta do is guard this drawer until midnight, and the best part about it is Captain Holt has absolutely no idea.
He is such a fool.
Yes, I'm the fool.
You fool.
So we wanted Jake to take the crown?
Sergeant, are you familiar with the Hungarian fencing term, HosszÃº Gorcs?
You must realize my answer is no.
It's a strategy of letting your opponent win points early to give them a sense of overconfidence, thus exposing a much easier target for you later.
You think he's overconfident enough?
I'm the smartest man alive.
I'm never gonna die.
Sir, do you have a minute?
Of course.
Jeffords, we'll rendezvous later.
Sir, I want to talk about Jake.
- Okay - Amy!
Help!
Our foot fungus heist has gone sideways!
Hitchcock, not now.
Scully doesn't know I'm in here.
I stole his foot cream, but then I lost it.
Amy, you're the only hope I have of finding it.
You're a detective.
You're a detective!
Get out of here!
Go!
Sir, Jake really pissed me off, and I want to help you take him down.
Well, that's an intriguing proposition.
You certainly could be useful Thank you.
To Jake!
I got you, Peralta!
You're not fooling anyone!
Why does everyone think that's where a camera would be?
Because the cleavage cloaks the camera with its curves.
That will be all, spy.
- Sorry I said cleavage.
- Mm-hmm.
Charles, that is so nasty you put cockroaches in your pants.
When you say it like that, yeah.
But Jake made it sound so cool.
How?
Oh, I wasn't expecting anyone.
- Come in, Nadia.
- Hey, Charles.
What up, bro?
Gina, this was the boy I was telling you about.
You're Nadia?
Well, my real name's Leo; Nadia's just my tag.
I don't love it, but when Banksy gives you a nickname, it just sticks.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
This isn't a setup this is a setup.
And all of this is supposed to distract me from the heist.
- The heist?
- The heist?
You shut your hot lips.
Charles, I don't buy it.
This is an obvious trap, okay?
Who are you, really, hmm?
You some male prostitute that Charles busted out on some lonely pier somewhere?
Well, guess what, sweetie?
This is one trick you ain't gonna be turning tonight.
I'm not a prostitute.
Okay.
Right.
Bye-bye, whore.
It's go time, Sergeant.
Hey, Rosa.
I'm not saying these are from your motorcycle, but I found these stripped handlebars outside.
You better not have messed with my bike for this heist.
Let me remind you I'm carrying a weapon.
We all have the same weapons.
Damn, Rosa!
Where'd you get that?
The scorpion has left the nest.
And Ding.
See Daddy?
Come on.
Time for the twin twist.
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey, you guys.
We wanted to surprise Terry; have you seen him?
Oh, he just went downstairs for a bit, but he should be back soon.
Oh.
Cagney?
Lacey?
Do you guys want to take a picture with Uncle Jake?
Yeah!
You don't mind, do you?
Um no, of course not.
That would be so fun.
What if we do it in the briefing room, like you're assigning them a case?
No, I mean, you know what would be fun even more that that is if we took a picture right here, and I could have my hand on this cabinet.
Okay.
- Nailed it.
- Here we go.
Oh, God, it was in video mode sorry.
Take your time; I could do this all day.
Matter of fact, what if we did one where I had both hands on the cabinet one on top, and then one on the front?
Looks good, yeah.
All right, smile three, two, one Cheese!
Very good.
Great, you guys.
Let's go find Daddy.
What's going on?
Aha!
What are you doing?
Nothing just enjoying a taste of my favorite beverage, the soda pop.
Really?
I have never seen you enjoy soda pop before.
- Hmm.
- Have some now.
Ahh.
- It's delicious.
- I don't buy it.
You're making the same face you made when you found a chocolate chip in your trail mix.
Something's up.
I'm patting you down.
Damn it, nothing but a surprisingly toned set of abs.
Why would I have the crown, Jake?
Isn't it still in the interrogation room?
Yes.
Yes.
Of course.
Of course it's still in there.
Welp, I guess I'll see you at midnight.
- After you.
- No, after you.
I insist.
Ugh.
You drank a soda?
Not sure that's the worst thing in the world.
It was the worst thing in the world worse than a fruit-forward Riesling.
No, I'm not exaggerating.
Anyhow, I cleverly ditched the crown in a trash can wait a minute so as to not arouse suspicion and then retrieve it.
Got it.
Hey while I'm in there, should I get you a soda?
I know you're joking, but on the off chance you aren't No.
- Hi, there.
- Oh, is it?
The handlebar thing was fake.
They were trying to distract me.
I think they made a play for the crown.
I know, but I had my hand on the cabinet the whole time, so I'm pretty confident there's no way they could have gotten it.
They got it.
Look at the back.
Screws are loose.
Damn it.
That son of a bitch is good.
Sir, we got a problem.
The crown wasn't in the trash can.
Jake must have taken it back.
Damn it.
That son of a bitch is good.
We have to get that crown back.
I already changed my email to "kingjakerulez" with a z. Everyone's going to think I'm an idiot.
- Hello, Peralta.
- Captain.
- Midnight nears.
- Yes, it does.
- Tick tock.
- Tick tock indeed.
But tick tock for who?
You know it's "for whom".
Don't try to provoke me.
I didn't know that.
I'm going to get that crown back.
- Wait what?
- Huh?
Will you excuse me for just one moment?
Yes, I too need to be excused.
He doesn't have the crown!
Why you asked that?
- I don't know who has it.
- What do we do?
Pull the security tape.
I'll distract them.
Hey, look at this.
Ahhhhhhhhhh.
Damn it, how did that not work?
Hmm, Captain Holt said you guys stole the crown when Jake came through the ceiling.
Yeah, I can't believe you fell for that.
You really think I'd mark the wrong vent?
I've never marked a wrong vent in my life.
You're very intense about vents.
Yeah.
Wait so Nadia wasn't just a distraction?
No, 100% real.
Handsome, cool, hair as thick as a collie's.
I found you the perfect guy, and you drove him off.
Ugh.
I'm sorry.
I should have trusted you.
Please call him and tell him I messed up.
Fine, but only if you agree that your first date will be a double date with me and Genevieve on a week-long trip to Turk's Forget it, no.
Forget it.
No!
Okay, I'll call him.
Please, I want this so badly.
Fine, you may call him for me.
Thank you.
Okay, here I am taking pictures with Terry's kids.
Man, I look so strong standing next to them.
- Should I have kids?
- Sure.
Okay.
It's Holt.
Whoa, how did he do that?
Guy has an insane set of abs.
Oh, look, he's got the crown.
And he's headed to the break room.
He dumped it in the trash.
Did he go back and get it?
Nope, janitor came in and took it.
But which janitor?
Looks like I'm going to have to squint.
His name is Al Al the janitor.
All right, it's 11:00 P.M. now; That means Al's long gone.
How are we going to get his home address?
Who's the one person you know who's anal enough to send out holiday cards to every single employee?
- Amy!
- What do you want, Jake?
What?
Why would you assume that I want anything?
What I want is to apologize to my girlfriend, who I hurt.
It's "whom".
Why does the word "who" even exist if you're not allowed to say it?
Anyways, now that I've apologized and you've accepted, can you give me janitor Al's address?
This is related to your heist, isn't it?
No, no.
It's about a crime.
I think janitor Al is going to kill the president.
Oh, Santiago.
There's my protÃ©gÃ©.
Let me guess you want the janitor's address.
Janitor?
Address?
Al?
I never said his name.
Well, isn't this rich.
After being excluded by both of you, here I am with the power to decide who wins and who loses your little heist.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
You are my wisest detective.
Pathetic.
She can't be manipulated, sir.
Amy, we are in love.
I know we've never said it before, but I think this is the perfect time, don't you?
Love?
Ha.
What's love compared to the respect of a workplace superior?
Amy Santiago, will you m - Enough!
- Okay.
Pretending to be nice to me is worse than being mean.
You know what?
You want the address?
Here, you can both have it.
Hope you're happy, you selfish monsters.
- I feel terrible.
- We should apologize.
Yes, I agree.
You definitely should now; I'll do mine later.
Fat chance.
Charles, I need your butt.
Meet me downstairs.
Alpha Team, this is the Golden Sparrow.
Rendezvous at Drop Zone Yankee.
When did you come up with those code names?
Okay, he lives on the sixteenth floor.
I think we beat Holt here.
- Or did you?
- I'll get the elevator.
Crap!
Looks like we're taking the stairs.
All right, it's sixteen floors pace yourselves.
Forget it.
Run as fast as you can!
Ha ha!
I win.
I knocked first.
You're not Al.
You're looking for Al?
Of course we're looking for Al, you imbecile!
Sorry.
He's having a cigarette on the roof.
The roof?
Yes.
I did it.
I am the greatest athlete in the world.
Al?
Al?
Where's Al?
Oh, there he is.
There he is!
I did it.
I did it.
Good God.
Are you Al the janitor?
Nope.
I'm your worst nightmare.
Amy Santiago.
Oh, no.
I don't understand what is happening.
Allow me to explain.
Amy and I were ahead of you the whole time.
No, you weren't part of this.
Get back over to the loser side, loser.
All right.
Worth a shot.
So how'd you pull it off?
Well, it all started when I went to tell Jake how badly he hurt my feelings, and he yelled at my breasts.
Oh, boy, I am not going to come off well in this story.
Nope.
Remember when you set off the witch?
You made Captain Holt flinch, which was weird, since his door was closed, but not weird, since he actually heard it over a bug he planted at your desk.
It was in an old muffin that you never threw in the trash.
That's why people throw away garbage.
How are we together?
Eh.
Anyway, I tapped into the bug's frequencies, so I had ears on Jake.
I needed to know what Holt was up to.
That's where Hitchcock came in.
I masterminded the entire plan.
You did one small thing, and I had to explain it to you, like, 45 times.
He left a tiny crack in the blind, so I could read the Captain's lips.
"Sharon and your kids will distract Jake.
"They'll be here at 9:30 sharp.
My waffle xylophone on the cheese man".
What?
My lip-reading is not flawless.
Now that I knew your plan, it was simple to disrupt.
While Scully gracefully moved the witch, I got into character.
Holt triggered the witch, which brought Jake into the room.
And I threw the crown in the trash can.
Exactly as I planned.
Then I sent you all here, placed an out-of-order sign on the perfectly functional elevator, made you all walk up and vomit twice.
Actually, it was four times, if you count all the stairwell stuff.
You thought I was just Holt's lackey.
And you thought I was just Jake's girlfriend.
Well, I'm my own person, capable of making my own decisions, and I decided to humiliate you both.
Well, you did, and it was awesome.
One last question: where's the crown?
Oh, it's at Shaw's Bar, the official site of my coronation.
All hail the crown of destiny.
And all hail she who wears it, Amy Santiago, the Queen.
Queen of the nine-nine.
I believe there's something else you both need to say.
Gladly.
Amy Santiago is an amazing detective/genius.
Drinks are on us.
- Nope.
- Drinks are on me.
Yeah!
Hey.
I'm glad you showed up.
Sorry I was acting so weird earlier.
Hey, I don't blame you.
Sagittarius, right?
With Saturn where it is, you're right to be wary of new relationships.
How is it possible that a spirit such as yourself even knows Charles?
I did an art show at Genevieve's gallery.
Oh, right so you're not really friends, you know his girlfriend through the art world.
Yeah, plus, she's my twin sister.
What?
Hi, Leo.
A kiss for my bro.
And a kiss for my beau.
No.
A kiss for my beau.
And a kiss for my sis.
No!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Falcon one, do we have a go?
The light is green, tiger one.
What are you gonna say when you crash through the window?
Hey, there, sorry for dropping in.
Goose bumps, Jake.
Goose bumps.
- Is the equipment secure?
- Check.
- Weapon loaded?
- Check.
Did you have breakfast?
What?
That's not on the checklist.
I added it because I care about you.
- No, I did not have breakfast.
- Unacceptable.
Look in your pocket.
Hey, there's little chocolate chips in this.
Yeah, I'm not an idiot.
I know how to trick my best friend into eating his fiber.
All right, bar digested.
Mission go.
- NYPD!
- Stay where you are!
Hands in the air where I can see 'em!
Hey, there, sorry for dropping in.
Was it cool?
It felt really cool.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was pretty cool.
Pretty cool?
What went wrong?
- Nothing.
- You have fudge on cheek.
Oh, from the breakfast bar, Boyle!
So I smash through the window, feet first.
There's glass everywhere, and I say, "Hey, there, sorry for dropping in".
- Ho!
- Whoa.
And the best part is, there was nothing on my cheek.
That's a weird detail to throw in there.
You're a weird detail to throw in there.
- Hmm?
What?
- Wait a second, Peralta.
You busted through a window for no reason?
Basic police tactic, Sarge.
Cover every exit.
It was a sealed window on the fifth floor.
You could have just gone in the door with Charles.
Yeah, but then what would my catchphrase have been?
"Knock, knock, who's there?
Justice"?
Ooh, that's actually amazing.
- Charles, write that down.
- Already did.
Sarge, what's the big deal?
We stopped two kilos of heroin from hitting the streets.
Who cares about one broken window?
I do!
I'm the one who has to spend all weekend doing paperwork because of your dumb stunt.
But Terry loves paperwork?
- No, Jake, I do not.
- Oh.
Look, man, I've got two kids, a job, and a very pregnant wife.
I get one hour a week to myself on Sundays.
You know what I do with that time?
I run a hot bubble bath, wheel in a TV, and watch sports bloopers.
Sports bloopers?
They're hilarious and relaxing, and they humanize my heroes.
Okay, well, I went through a window.
That's a blooper of sorts, right?
No!
It's not a blooper if you meant to do it!
Thanks for ruining my weekend.
This is a debacle.
Oh, man.
Sarge is pissed.
What are we gonna do, Jake?
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.
We just have to turn this debacle into a straight-up "bacle".
Guess I should be getting back.
Uncle Ray, thank you for loaning me you best detective for lunch.
My pleasure.
Of course, she is entitled to 45 minutes as per her union contract.
Okay, well, great to see you.
Bye, baby.
A minute, Detective Diaz.
What's going on with you and Marcus?
What are you talking about?
Your shoulders tightened when he said "baby".
Your nostrils flared when I asked what was going on with the two of you.
And you have saag paneer on your sleeve, which, given your aversion to Indian cuisine, suggests you let him choose the restaurant.
Why would you do that?
- Kindness.
- Pity.
You're about to break up with him.
- Damn, you are good.
- Mm-hmm.
Things aren't working out.
I don't want to talk about it.
I regret the words we've already spoken.
Listen, I know I probably shouldn't get involved, but Marcus is my nephew, and I hope you'll let him down gently.
Don't worry.
I don't want things to be awkward.
I'm gonna send him a text while he's sleeping that says, "We're done".
Clear.
Accurate.
But do you feel like it's enough?
"We're done.
Good-bye".
Yes.
That should do it.
What's going on, Peralta?
Charles says you're going to make me happier than I was on my wedding night.
Well, that's not how I would have put it, but I know you were mad at me for ruining blooper time, so I did all your paperwork.
That's not helpful.
You always make a thousand mistakes.
Mm-hmm, that's what Amy said as well right before she took over for me, so it's perfect.
Okay.
Hey, thanks, man.
I appreciate it.
And I spoke with Sharon.
I spoke with Captain Holt.
And we all agree that you deserve a break.
So this weekend, Charles and I are taking you to the great outdoors to Detective Lohank's cabin.
Boom.
Suck it, wedding night.
Lohank?
That sad sack?
All he does is talk about his wife sleeping with other men.
No, he also has some great stories about his prostate cancer.
Besides, he's not sticking around.
It's just the three of us.
Those woods are full of ticks.
It's Lyme disease central.
So we'll get some bug spray.
Plus that cabin's probably covered in black mold.
- Racist.
- You know what?
I am gonna stay home and have a blooper bath.
Oh, come on, Sarge.
It's gonna be fun.
You remember fun, right?
What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
It's just I planned this awesome guys' weekend for us, and all you can think about is Lyme disease.
Untrue.
I'm thinking about all tick-borne diseases anaplasmosis, tularemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
You know, maybe I could just chill out a little.
Yes.
You're stressed.
A little fun would do you good, I promise.
You know what?
You're right.
You all better get ready for fun Terry.
Ooh, fun Terry.
He sounds fun.
Oh, he's crazy.
Thanks for planning this, Jake.
No, thank you for being amazing and also for driving us up to the cabin.
My car's in the shop, and riding in Charles's is like sitting inside of a dog's behonkus.
Fun Terry.
Can't wait.
Hey, Gina.
Would you do me a favor?
Yes, thank you for asking.
I did not feel like doing this work right now.
Oh, those look like important papers.
What's up?
How can I help?
Well, when I was a kid, I invented a magnetic flashlight clip so I could read under the covers.
This clip and I went all around the world together the Shire, Sweet Valley High, Terabithia.
But never to a friend's house, huh?
Uncalled for.
Anyway, I realized that this could be really helpful for police work, so I made an appointment with the head of NYPD purchasing.
I have to sell him on it, but I'm afraid I might come across a little boring.
Amy, are you asking me to "She's All That" you?
I didn't read that.
But if it's about helping out a friend, then yes.
Please "She's All That" me.
Okay.
But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it my way, all right?
First I'm going to need to break you down to nothing and then build you back up piece by piece.
Well, the meeting's tomorrow.
Well, we'll just break you down to nothing and see what time it is.
Mmm!
What is that smell?
That is the absence of urine.
You got to leave Brooklyn to get that.
No urine I could get used to this.
Oh, yes.
And that's just the beginning, my friend.
Just wait till you're sitting fireside, sipping on a premium Chinese Scotch, and smoking a sweet Rwandan cigar.
Okay.
Okay.
I probably could have done without the countries of origin, but that sounds great.
- Yeah.
- What else do you have planned?
Oh, so much.
I'm talking fishing.
I'm talking poker.
I'm talking Frisbee.
Boyle, what else am I talking?
Wildflower picking so we can make our own cologne.
Nope, I was talking bonfires and s'mores, but that's my fault for throwing to you.
This is going to be fun as hell.
This is going to be the best weekend ever!
Welcome to Stink Puddle Manor.
Stink Puddle?
Manor.
Just out of curiosity, why would you name your house Stink Puddle?
Oh, I didn't.
The home inspector came up with it.
I can't smell anything since the radiation therapy.
Another great story, eh?
So there's no power, no heat.
Is there running water?
Of course there's running water.
Oh, but I wouldn't use it.
It's very contaminated.
We had three dogs die in the well.
Three?
If they weren't all tied together, we might have just lost the one.
Sad thing is, they were therapy dogs for my son.
Oh.
He had real abandonment issues after my wife left.
It was kind of like an emotional scar on an emotional scar.
But the woods are super nice, right?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Gorgeous.
Except during sinkhole season.
When's sinkhole season?
It's been going on for, like, 20 years now.
It's kind of like a "Game of Thrones" winter.
Right.
Yeah.
Anyway, I'll leave you guys to it.
Have fun.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
For instance, drink the water or let your wife go on work trips.
Duly noted.
You wanted to see me?
I told Kevin about how I approved of your strategy for breaking up with Marcus, and he said that we were "sociopaths".
So you're gonna leave him?
No, I think he may have a point.
You might need to do more than simply text.
A long, drawn-out breakup is just gonna end in a big scene and Marcus crying.
He has so many emotions.
It's just so beautiful how much they love each other.
It's a commercial for a refrigerator.
Yes, it is daunting.
But I did some research on amicable breakups.
I visited - Do you know that site?
- No.
Well, apparently, it's less painful if you acknowledge the dumpee's feelings.
- Ew.
- But don't worry.
We'll practice.
Hmm?
I'll be Marcus.
Go.
Marcus, I think we should break up.
That makes me feel sad.
I am sad.
Your sadness is noted.
I feel acknowledged.
Thank you for breaking up with me.
It will take me eight minutes to collect my things.
I think that went very well.
Hmm.
Okay, creek.
I'd like three fresh trout to go, please.
It just went straight up.
Now it's coming down.
Oh, boy!
Watch and learn, losers.
Yah!
- I didn't see where it went.
- Back of my neck.
It's in the back of my neck.
Okay, I've learned from your mistakes.
Not too hard, late release, and That was fun.
Fishing was fun.
- Yeah.
- Back to the cabin?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Before we get into your pitch, what are you calling the product?
The Handless Lighting System, or HLS.
Sounds like a genetic disorder.
How's about Shoulder Nova?
I love it.
Amazing.
It's perfect.
Now let's talk presentation.
What's your opener?
Hi, I'm Amy Santiago, and my product will make a real difference.
It is the Shoulder Nova.
My only note is, make it Very good note.
Yeah.
Okay.
I got it.
Mm Ding.
Oh, hello.
I'm Amy Santiago.
Was that captivating enough?
Weirdly, it might have been a scooch too captivating.
Here's what I'm thinking.
Mm-kay?
You can take a seat.
Okay.
Until this moment, there was only darkness.
But now there is light.
I am Vanessa Santiago, and I'm about to blow your minds.
You want me to change my name to Vanessa?
Desperately.
I got to say, the Chinese know how to make a terrible scotch.
They certainly do.
Ugh, it's bad.
Gets you drunk, though.
Well, I found all the worms.
They're eating a fox corpse in the outhouse.
Speaking of which, I'm getting hungry.
- What's for dinner?
- Dinner?
Yes, of course.
Dinner.
Did you not pack any food?
There's fresh fox.
Oh, it is not fresh.
Are you serious?
We stopped three times on the way up here to buy fireworks, and you never thought to get groceries?
What was in those coolers?
The fireworks.
Look, I thought we would be incredible at fishing.
Excuse me for believing in us.
It'll be okay, guys.
No need to worry.
I was voted Mr. Fungus.
Aha, Mr. Fungus to the rescue.
See, Sarge, everything's going to work out, and you don't have to stress all the time.
Boyle, you really think you can find us dinner?
Um, let's just say Something bad happened to Charles, didn't it?
Big time.
Oh God, what if the last thing we ever heard him say was "spore-gasbord"?
Charles!
Charles!
Relax.
If anybody can handle it out here, it's Charles.
He saw "Into the Woods" ten times in the theater.
Watch it.
That's poison ivy.
Whoa.
Good call.
I'm allergic to poison ivy.
making out in the woods with Liz Almont.
Okay, fine.
We weren't making out.
I was looking for my inhaler.
And it wasn't sports camp.
It was asthma camp.
Hey, Jake.
Are we lost?
We're on an "adventure".
Right, Fun Terry?
Fun Terry's gone.
He starved to death an hour ago.
This is Original Terry.
That's the worst Terry.
You didn't bring a map or a flashlight or anything that could keep us from getting lost?
Yes, I brought all of those things.
It's called a cell phone.
An app that makes me sound like T-Pain.
Nope, the battery's dead.
Now it's just a brick.
But don't freak out.
I don't need an app to sound like T-Pain, right?
We're totally lost Yeah, that was a little more Kermit, but Oh, you're back.
How did the breakup go?
I tried to acknowledge his feelings.
It wasn't easy.
There were a lot of them.
I'm just so confused.
So sad.
Are you climbing out the window?
No.
I climbed back in, and we talked about emotions for 20 minutes.
- Dear God.
- I know.
But I think it went well.
At least there was no crying.
Well done, Diaz.
I'm actually really glad you made me do it this way.
I got to tell him that even though it was ending, it was incredibly meaningful to me, and I'm gonna miss him.
Oh, no.
This is exactly what I didn't want.
You crying?
Oof!
I deserved that.
Charles is dead, and we're next.
All right, don't be so melodramatic.
He's probably chewing on bark and berries, having the time of his life, safe and sound.
Terry!
Jake!
Ho, ho!
What's that I hear?
Charles Boyle, safe and sound?
What are you saying, Charles?
That you're having the time of your life?
I fell in a sinkhole, and I'm badly hurt!
Damn it!
Boyle, what the hell?
I know.
It's a pretty big hole, right?
How'd you end up down there?
I spotted a gorgeous chanterelle.
I reached for it, but then I rolled my ankle and fell in.
All right, buddy, don't worry.
We got you, okay?
I was so scared, you guys.
A psychic told me I was gonna die alone in a pit, and I kept telling myself, "This is a hole, not a pit.
This is a hole, not a pit.
"This is a hole, not a pit.
"This is a hole, not a pit.
Charles, it's a hole, not a pit".
All right.
Here, grab me.
Take my hand, all right?
Okay.
Okay, now pull us up, Terry.
Oh crap, I'm slipping!
No, it's Lohank's dogs all over again!
So in conclusion, by eliminating flashlight fumbling, the Shoulder Nova could save the average police officer over 13,000 seconds.
Wow, that sounds like a lot, Vanessa.
It is.
I guess there's only one thing left to do.
You have the right to remain Uhh!
Well lit!
Wow, that presentation was terrific.
So fun to watch.
Thank you, sir.
See, the problem is the product.
I just don't see any need for it at all.
I just put the flashlight in my mouth when my hands are full.
Sir, the human mouth is nasty.
Yeah, but mouths are free.
I'm sorry.
I'm just not interested.
Okay.
Thank you for your time.
You are scum.
This isn't working.
- Great trip, Jake.
- Oh, thanks, man.
You know that was sarcastic!
How?
You didn't bring food or water or ask if Lohank's cabin was straight out of a horror movie.
Now you got us trapped in a pit!
Hole.
Okay, I know that things are not looking great right now, but you have to admit, you were having fun earlier.
I'm not now.
I'm more stressed than ever.
Maybe that's 'cause you're just focusing on the negative, Ter-bear.
I mean, look at Charles.
He's chill.
I'm chill.
That's 'cause he's in shock!
You know what?
The reason you're so chill is because you have everyone cleaning up your messes for you.
Didn't bring food?
Charles will find mushrooms.
Smashed through a window?
Terry'll do the paperwork.
Hey, I did the paperwork.
No, Amy did it!
Oh, guys, please, please calm down.
I hate it when you argue.
It reminds of when my dad used to fight with my best friend my mom.
I'm done with this.
I'm going to sleep.
Charles, spoon with me.
We need to huddle together for warmth.
No, Charles, you're my best friend.
You're going to spoon with me.
I called first spoon.
Charles, get over here right now.
Boyle, don't throw away a lifelong friendship for a one-night spoon with Terry.
Okay, enough.
We're gonna stop fighting.
We're gonna lie down, and we're gonna triple-spoon like grown-ups!
Come on, bring it in.
Bring it in.
There, okay.
See, that's better, right?
So do we know any songs?
Shut up, Charles!
Jake?
Where's Jake?
Did you eat him, Terry?
No!
Good morning, guys!
How'd you get out of the pit?
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.
Actually, it took me hours.
I tied all my clothes together, tethered them to a log, and used it as a grappling hook.
Managed to snag it in a root.
Aren't you freezing?
Not at all.
Mainly because my skin is on fire from all the poison ivy in this tree.
Why'd you do that?
Oh, let me guess.
Dumb mistake.
No, dumb choice.
I didn't want to sit around and wait for somebody to clean up my mess.
Hmm, I guess I got through to you.
Yeah.
Also, after you fell asleep, Boyle really laid into me.
It was brutal.
I got to say, Jake, this time, I think you're only 99% right.
- We're rolling.
- No!
Argh!
Well, can you see anything from up there?
Yes, I can Stink Puddle Manor, about 65 trees sunward.
Man, one day in the woods, and I'm freakin' Lewis and Clark up here.
Thank you for coming, Diaz.
I want to apologize for yesterday.
Inserting myself into my employee's breakup with my nephew somehow, uh, backfired.
It's not your fault.
I'm the one that made a scene like a dumb, crying baby.
I'm considering having my tear ducts melted shut.
It's not the end of the world to feel things.
I guess not.
It's up there.
The thing is, I really care about Marcus, but he wanted to get married, and I'm just not ready for that.
And if I'm not ready with a guy as great as Marcus, then what if I'm never ready?
What if that was it, my one chance at love?
What if I never get a second chance?
I don't know.
I'm just I'm just sad.
Well, I understand.
It must be very difficult.
Wait, are you crying?
Yes.
Thank you for acknowledging my feelings.
Thank you for acknowledging mine.
We're both great at this.
Hey, sport.
You look a little D in the D. D for "down in dumps," respectively.
Probably easier to just not abbreviate if you have to explain it.
Agree to D. I wanted to talk to you about yesterday.
Yeah, thank you for all your help with the presentation.
And I'm sorry you had to waste your talent on such a stupid product.
Without product makers like you, us dazzle-doves wouldn't have nothing to shake our wings over.
Yeah, but my invention was useless.
No, that scum was wrong.
I showed the Shoulder Nova to a girl in my building.
She's like a mini Amy, and she loved it.
She said she was gonna break the world record for speed-reading.
Psh!
Yeah.
Like some little girl's gonna take down Yuri Jurgonav.
Anyway, I know it wasn't what you wanted, but you still made a difference.
Thanks, Gina.
I guess I did make a D. - Don't steal my thing.
- Okay.
- That's all I ask.
- I won't.
Hey, Sarge.
Why'd you want us to meet you out here?
To thank you guys for the weekend.
Really?
It was a total disaster.
Not a total disaster.
None of us got sick from that dog water.
- You drank that?
- No.
Look, Jake, you were right.
I have kind of forgotten how to have fun.
I'm going to try to work on that, so The fireworks you made me surrender when we reentered New York!
Uh-huh.
Fun Terry's back.
We're gonna set 'em off in a big pile, all at once.
By shooting our guns at them?
- What?
No.
- No.
We're going to set 'em off like normal people.
Oh.
That's good too.
Ooh.
Here we go.
Whoo-hoo!
See how fun this is?
Original Terry would have been worried that we're standing too close and need safety goggles, and he would have been absolutely right.
We're way too close.
Run!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Hey, Jakey, the place on the corner is serving lemonade, and you get to keep the jar.
It's pretty cool.
Yes, that's very cool, Scully.
Mm-hmm.
Will you excuse me just one moment?
Oh, sure.
Guys, guys, guys!
Scully has a mason jar full of lemonade.
You called us in here to tell us that?
No, I called you in here to change your lives!
For, you see, a mere five minutes ago, Hitchcock introduced me to his new goldfish, who lives in An identical mason jar!
Oh, this isn't gonna end well.
There are two possible outcomes, and we're going to bet on which one happens first.
So, will Hitchcock put fish food in Scully's lemonade, or will Scully drink Hitchcock's goldfish?
Now, you would think that putting fish food into lemonade Hitchcock just drank his own fish.
What?
Nooo!
Ames, you're two minutes late.
I called all the emergency rooms.
I know.
I went home from your place to shower, and I'm so tired that I fell asleep while shaving my legs.
But we went to bed so early.
"Property Brothers" was over at 10:00.
I mean sex.
We do it.
She's tired from all the doing it.
- Who are you talking to?
- Precinct.
- Come on, man.
- Yeah.
No, I was up all night because your dumb, lumpy mattress is so uncomfortable.
What?
But I gave you the good lump.
Ugh, please stop talking till I finish eating my coffee.
Ooh, a lover's quarrel.
No, I'm just tired.
I didn't ask for part two.
Never fear, Amy, for I have the solution to all of your problems: Highly potent liquid speed.
Oh, you gonna love that stuff.
Devon, we're cops.
Read the room.
But I know you'll be excited, because I busted Devon here with four vials of this, which is a new drug called Taxi!
You actually found some?
Yup.
Your CI was right.
It's popping up on the corners.
Man, my snitches are the best.
The key is to always send them handwritten thank-you notes.
Oh.
So what do you say?
Shall we take this partnership from the sheets to the streets?
Ooh, our first case as a couple.
- Why not?
- Hey, guys.
I just discovered a new drug too.
It's called "your relationship," and I'm high on it.
Charles, I'm gonna need you to back off, man.
- Roger that.
- Yeah.
All right.
I'll take one.
Now, go sell your candy to everyone else, stupid.
Hey, hey, hey.
You can't call a kid stupid.
What if he's really stupid?
Terry, this is Sam, my little brother from Brooklyn's Big Brothers.
I think it's funny when she calls me stupid.
- No one cares, stupid.
- Screw you, Rosa.
Sam's selling candy to pay for his basketball uniforms.
He's a forward.
I taught him how to elbow.
Cool?
Now, go home and do all your homework, or I will end you.
Don't let Rosa fool you.
She's not that scary.
She used to do ballet.
No way.
Which gave me the physical skills I need to strangle you with my feet.
Now scram.
I love being a mentor.
It's called "taxi" because it's yellow, and it takes you where you need to be.
Drug dealers have gotten so creative.
It used to just be "crack," and then they'd be like, "Hey, we got a new one.
What are we gonna call this"?
And they'd go, "I don't know, crank"?
This is certainly worth following up on.
Santiago, take Boyle, and work the case.
Oh, but Jake I mean, Detective Peralta brought in the perp, so Good point.
Peralta and Boyle can work the case.
Actually, sir, I think we were kind of hoping we could work the case together.
Oh, are you two no longer Smooshing booties?
Yes, that's exactly how I was gonna finish my sentence.
- Figured.
- We are still dating.
It's all above board.
HR gets daily updates and are BCC'd on all our emails to each other.
That's why HR Jim keeps high-fiving me.
As a rule, I don't put couples in the field together, but you are two of my best detectives, so I will allow it.
Just don't let any personal issues distract you from your work.
You have nothing to worry about.
There's no personal issues here.
- We've never even had a fight.
- It's true.
Our only close call was when Jake didn't know who Will Shortz was.
Really?
Never heard of the Puzzlemaster?
This is who you want to be with?
I shouldn't get involved.
Good luck with the case.
Thank you.
Whoa, what's up with you, Furiosa?
I'm in a huff, that's what, because of what just happened in the garage.
Charles in charge of our days and our nights What?
Nuh-uh.
How am I supposed to come on!
Some clown clown-parked his clown car in Captain Holt's spot and halfway into mine.
What a clown!
- Sporty?
- Mm-hmm.
- Convertible?
- Yeah, that's the one.
Oh, I hate people who drive sports cars.
You're not Gloria Estefan, and this isn't Miami.
- Charles.
- Hey, Captain.
Get ready to join me in the huff zone.
- No.
- Some creep had the gall I saw you drove Gertie to work this morning, - huh, Captain?
- Oh, yes.
Kevin and I finally brought her up from the country.
Gertie is our convertible.
I think you'd like her.
She's a real peppy broad.
Oh, I didn't realize that was your car.
My car?
Oh, "Raymond Holt" may be on the title, but no man can own her spirit.
Anyway, I'm sorry, Bole.
I interrupted you.
You were saying something about some creep.
Just some strangler that I was arrested.
I was talking about some strangler that I arrested.
Well, good job.
Put the paperwork on my desk.
Thank you.
Great.
Now I have to go find a strangler.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So I marked all the corners where taxi has been spotted on this map.
You'll probably notice right away that it makes the shape of a boob.
This looks great.
Confirms Devon's story.
He says his dealer hangs out here, in the underboob.
He said he'll point him out to us.
So you approach on foot from the south, and me and Devon will be in an unmarked car here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
"Me and Devon"?
Didn't you mean "Devon and I"?
- Oh, God.
- I corrected your grammar!
Are you so proud of me?
Are you horrified?
Are you super horny?
I'm just really tired.
Leave me alone.
Don't you mean leave "I" alone?
No, that one felt wrong.
I guess we're equally bad at grammar.
I'm not bad at grammar.
I'm exhausted because you refuse to get a new mattress!
All right, why don't you just get a new back?
I didn't mean that.
We're not fighting.
We can totally work together.
We're fine.
Yeah, that wasn't a fight.
That was just sexy workplace banter.
Exactly.
I mean, mattresses are also sexy 'cause that's where you do it.
Yeah.
And grammar is a system of language involving syntax and semantics.
Also sexy.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
- Point is, we're good.
- Yeah.
All right.
You're almost to the corner.
You sure you're not gonna be spotted?
Absolutely.
My cover makes me invisible.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Do you have two minutes to talk about the environment?
Nailed it.
Now no one will make eye contact with me.
I think it's cute.
You're like an idealistic grad student.
Ah, you like that?
You want me to tell you about the time that I backpacked through the Netherlands?
Ooh, did you fold all your stuff up really small to fit into one carry-on?
Is that what you want me to have done?
Hey, there's my dealer.
Jake, Grey jacket.
6:00.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have two minutes to talk about the environment?
NYPD!
Freeze!
We got a rabbit!
He's headed for the building.
I'll just stay here.
All right; Let's split up and meet around back.
NYPD!
Freeze!
Jake, he's coming your way!
- Ooh!
- Ugh!
- Nice takedown.
- Thanks.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
Nothing, nothing.
Let's just take this guy in.
No.
What is it?
It's just this mattress looks just like your mattress at home.
What?
No, it doesn't.
I mean, sure, there are a couple of similarities, but oh, man.
It's the exact same one.
Ugh!
I have a dumpster mattress!
All right.
That settles it.
We're going mattress shopping.
Seriously?
Oh, this is the best.
I'm so proud of you.
You know, once we get it, we'll have to break it in.
Oh, I hear what you're saying: Mattress trampoline.
Wait, no.
You were talking about sex.
- Yeah.
- Then mattress trampoline.
- Sure.
- Okay.
Diaz, your friend Sam is here.
Nice.
That little dum-dum finished his homework early.
Where is he?
Before I answer, maybe we could brew a pot of nice, relaxing kava tea, - and then - Spit it out.
Sam was brought in for shoplifting a phone.
I also have chamomile!
That might calm us down.
Oh, if you want calm, there's some ludes in evidence, if anybody would ever let me get them out.
Hey!
What were you thinking?
I made a mistake!
The phones were just lying there, and I didn't think things through.
I'm sorry, Rosa.
Rosa is your friend from before you were a criminal.
You are dealing with Detective Diaz now, and she is gonna make sure you rot in juvie for the rest of your life.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
It feels like you're being a little harsh.
Thanks.
Good note.
I was going for extremely harsh.
I'll turn it up.
Diaz, he's just a kid.
Can't you just let him off with a warning?
Sometimes, being as tough as possible doesn't lead to the best outcome.
This isn't Cagney calling Lacey a poopy-head.
I'm not just gonna give him a time-out.
Time-out?
Are you kidding?
"Poopy-head" means no "Doc McStuffins" for a week!
Terry hates bathroom talk.
Gina.
Gina.
Gina, I screwed up, big time.
Charles, given your daily life experiences, you're gonna have to be more specific.
Gertie!
Gertie!
There's only one option for me: Burn my face off with acid and disappear forever.
Yes, you should do that, or you could just tell him what happened.
I mean, he parked in two spots.
It's kind of his fault.
Just have some B-bone, Boyle.
You know that's my smallest bone.
Come on.
It's just a car.
He's not gonna be that mad.
Son of a bitch!
Okay.
I misjudged that one.
Oh, what did he do to you, Gertie?
What did he do?
It was an accident, sir.
Yes, an accident: The buffoon's apology.
This is your fault, mister.
Interesting.
Charles?
Do you feel that's the case?
Um, your car is pretty far over the line.
Mm.
So it's kind of your fault too.
Pass the blame.
The buffoonery is endless.
You're gonna pay for what you've done.
And it won't be cheap.
They'll have to custom-mix the color because they no longer make raspberry sherbet.
They're all so beautiful.
And they're all about to be tested bouncy-styles.
Three, six, nine Damn, she fine Hoping she can sock it to me one more time Get low, get low, get low, get low To the window To the window To the wall I love this mattress.
And it loves having you in it.
God?
- It's Brian.
- Oh.
And I'm obsessed with giving you a good night's sleep.
Hello, Brian.
Coming on a little strong there, buddy and I'm digging it.
How much to take this bad boy home?
Actually, that's one of our more reasonable models.
Oh.
Holy Moses!
That is much too much money.
Well, you spent twice that for Mr. Met to come to your birthday party.
Yeah, and it was worth it.
Mr. Met used my bathroom.
Number two.
That's a memory I will cherish forever.
Look, mattresses are expensive, but they're an investment.
It's gonna be in your life for a long time.
True, but it's also still just a mattress, you know?
It's a lot of money to spend on a rectangle that's filled with springs and goose hair.
- You know it's feathers.
- I didn't.
And it would be money well spent, because it would allow me to actually sleep in your bed.
But I already have a mattress.
It just doesn't seem worth it.
Okay, well, to me, it sounds like you're saying I'm not worth it.
So I'm gonna go sleep in my grown-up mattress that I bought this century, and you're not invited.
You know, she's right about mattresses being an investment.
Back off, Brian.
Morning.
You look well-rested.
Yes, because I slept in my own bed.
I was tossing and turning.
Jake told me about your fight, and I'm so worried about you two.
Thank you, Charles.
What do I have to do, buy the mattress myself?
Done.
- Problem solved.
- No.
It would make him so happy.
Good job on the bust yesterday.
How was it, working together as a couple?
- So good.
- So great.
- Yeah.
- Super mellow and chill.
Yeah.
- She slapped my butt once.
- Mm-hmm.
We're definitely falling in love.
- All right.
- Good, good, good.
We found something strange on the dealer you brought in: Two matchbooks from the same hotel.
He's refusing to give up his supplier, but this could be something.
That's weird.
Look at this.
The same two matches are missing from both books: Third one on the bottom row, and fifth one from the top.
- Coincidence?
- No way.
No one would take matches out like that.
Trust me; I smoked four cigarettes in college.
One to completion.
That's a code.
A code?
Exciting.
I'll go get my pencil case.
I bet it's a room number.
Third floor, fifth room.
Room 305.
- That's definitely it.
- Well, great.
Great, great.
Santiago has solved it.
I want you two to go undercover as a couple to stake out the room.
You should be very convincing, given that you're currently what was it?
"Smooshing booties".
Great, and thank you for saying it that way.
It made us both feel very comfortable.
Sure did.
Hey, I've been looking for you.
Before you decide what to do with Sam, there's someone I think you should talk to.
Ms. Miriam.
Surprise!
I tracked down your old ballet coach.
I brought her in to remind you of the effect a kind, nurturing presence can have on a young life.
Hello, dear.
Have you continued to dance?
No, Ms. Miriam.
Well, there's no surprise in that.
You always were a lazy ox.
- What's this now?
- Look at your posture.
You look as if you should be ringing the bells at Notre Dame.
Ms. Miriam was not nurturing at all.
All right, ox.
Let's see what you've got.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Eyes up.
Shoulders down.
Well, that wasn't terrible.
See, Sarge?
Tough love works.
Damn it!
Terry proved the wrong point.
Aw, Chuckles.
You're looking even more broken than usual.
Yeah, I should have never have tried to stand up to Captain Holt.
Why didn't I just beg for mercy?
It's my signature move: "The Charles".
No, you are actually in the right in this sitch.
The captain is being irrational.
But he's about to learn himself a lesson.
Right about Nah Oh, my!
Ow.
Timed it perfectly.
What?
What did you do to my cupcake?
This is yours?
Why on Earth is your cupcake on my chair?
Because it's very special to me, so I can put it wherever I want.
This is your fault.
Now you have to buy me a new cupcake.
This is outrageous.
You expect me to avoid oh, I see.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, you do.
- The cupcake was Gertie.
- Yes.
- Your butt was Charles's car.
- Yes.
The chair was the parking space.
Yes, I get it.
Your office was the garage.
Yes, I'm telling you I understand the lesson.
And I was the brilliant Gina Linetti in both scenarios.
All right.
We're done here.
'Kay.
You're a great captain.
Jake, why don't you just sit down?
No, thank you.
I can see the feed better from here.
It's really comfortable.
All right.
I'll sit.
Nope, my butt hates expensive things.
No.
You know what your butt hates?
Making any sort of sacrifice for us, because it's not serious about this relationship.
Okay, first of all, my butt is so serious it should be wearing spectacles.
And second, your butt is the butt that is not serious about this relationship.
My butt is totally serious.
I've made all kinds of changes.
I bought orange soda for you.
Okay!
For the last time, Orangina is not orange soda.
Yeah, because it's better.
Uh, okay, now you're just being crazy.
Ugh, you're not even taking this argument seriously.
All right.
You want to get serious?
How come you haven't told your mom that we're dating?
Yeah, that's right.
I saw the text she sent you about setting you up with some dude named Gary.
You read my texts?
It buzzed when you were in the bathroom.
Who doesn't bring their phone with them into the bathroom?
That's, like, the whole reason to go in there.
I haven't told her because I haven't had the chance.
What?
You talk to her, like, every week.
You basically stalk her.
Why don't you just admit that you don't want to tell her about me?
Jake, it's not about you.
Look; The minute I tell her that I'm dating someone, she's gonna call me all the time and ask me a million annoying questions.
Wow, it sounds like such a huge drag.
I guess I'm just not "worth it".
Boom used the thing you said to me in a different argument in this argument.
I win the argument.
Oh, no, no, no.
This is bad.
Well, you started it or I did.
- I can't remember at this point.
- No, Jake.
Look at the screen.
Oh, no.
For the last time, Orangina is not orange soda.
Yeah, because it's better.
Uh, okay, now you're just being crazy.
You're not even taking this You do have to admit, it was a pretty good point about Orangina, though.
Your turn, Peralta.
Thank you, Santiago.
Okay.
I know you're mad, but before you say anything, yes, we screwed up.
And yes, you warned us.
And yes, I don't know where I'm going with this.
But I do know this: I have reached the end of my sentence.
Oh, my God.
Did that work?
- Not at all.
- Oh.
I can't believe you let a personal argument derail your investigation.
I would characterize it more as a professional police disagreement.
- I listened to the tape.
- Oh, no.
Yeah, well, then you know that it was a straight-up crazy bitch fight.
Look; I know we screwed up the case, and I'm sorry.
But if it's any consolation, I think we also screwed up our relationship.
Peralta, have a seat.
I believe this might help.
When Kevin and I first started dating, he taught at a small college upstate.
It was two hours away by train or bus, but only 30 minutes by car.
Is this another one of your riddles?
You rode to work on his shoulders.
One set of footprints.
No?
- No.
- Okay.
Neither of us owned a car, and I didn't want to buy one because that would mean admitting that I cared for Kevin.
He had the same fear, and so visits were rare, and I was miserable.
Then one spring day, Kevin showed up at my door having purchased Gertie.
He took the leap, and I'm so grateful that he did.
I only regret that I didn't do it first.
Do you understand?
Absolutely.
The train is your old mattress.
- Yeah.
- The car is your new mattress.
- I got it.
- Kevin is you.
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm Santiago.
Loud and clear.
So I took care of Sam.
Uh-oh.
That sounds ominous, like you went all Ms. Miriam on him.
I let him off with a warning.
See, thing about Ms. Miriam is she made me a good dancer, but she ruined my childhood.
She was constantly riding me about my posture and my technique and my pink hair.
- Pink hair.
- Never speak of that.
Copy.
She's the reason I quit ballet, and I sure as hell don't want Sam to quit the Big Brother program 'cause of me.
This is totally how I thought this Ms. Miriam thing was gonna go.
Another flawless Terry plan.
Boyle, I thought you should know.
I just got Gertie back from the garage.
She looks as good as new.
Better, even, because after 12 years, they finally got the Annie Lennox cassette out of the tape player.
Oh, I love her.
Here's a check for the full amount.
You don't owe me anything.
It was my fault, and I behaved poorly, as Gina made abundantly clear.
Oh, speaking of, you still owe me $14 for that cupcake.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What's up?
Two things.
I ran the footage from the hotel through facial recognition software and got a match: Grady Lamont.
This is his current address.
That's good, I guess.
Yeah, it's six years old.
Well, druggies are lazy?
He deals in uppers.
- We're screwed.
- Yup.
What's the second thing?
Well, the Captain and I were jamming on some personal issues, just going back and forth.
I honestly think I helped him more than he helped me.
- I'm not buying any of that.
- No.
Amy Santiago I want to change mattresses for you.
That's the best thing I've ever heard.
I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.
I think I was just scared that you were gonna realize you're way better than me.
Like, you're Orangina, and I'm orange soda.
Are you kidding?
You're Orangina.
Ugh.
Don't say that.
Look.
I was scared too.
I'm gonna call my mom tonight.
Okay.
Let's buy this baby.
Calling up the website, finding the mattress, adding to cart, signing in as "guest" That is not an option.
Creating an account You don't have to buy it right this second.
Nope, this is a big romantic gesture, and I'm nailing it.
Shipping address not the same as billing address.
Got to enter both of those.
Jake, Jake, look!
There's our guy.
Oh, perfect timing.
Submit order.
Province?
Oh, no.
We're on the Canadian website.
Click on the American flag.
- Jake!
- Yeah.
We'll do this later.
Let's go!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Cluck, cluck!
Gobble, gobble!
Guess who just came from the P.S. 321 Thanksgiving Parade?
Charles, you actually might Who's Charles?
I'm Tommy Gobbler.
And I'm stuffed with Thanksgiving happiness!
Gobble, gobble!
- Seriously, Charles - Uh-uh, I warned you!
I'm Tommy Gobbler, you silly pilgrim.
- Okay, Tommy Gobbler.
- There you go!
These are the Davidsons.
They want to know what happened to their missing grandmother.
I have some deeply tragic news for you.
Listen up.
Diaz and I are going to Rikers to interview a guy we think has info on the Douglass Street murders.
Also, IT says the internet is down.
What?
No!
I had just clicked a link that said Balloon Boy grew up hot.
Now I will never see those pictures.
Can't you just use the internet on your phone?
Bitch, you know I'm out of data.
Jake, can I speak to you for a minute?
In private.
Ooh, someone's in trouble.
It's me.
I don't know why I did that.
So Sharon'll be here in an hour.
We're driving up to the Berkshires to spend one last weekend alone before the baby comes.
Yeah!
Somebody's gonna get it!
She's 37 weeks pregnant, man.
We're gonna eat pie in bed.
Oh, yeah.
I just wanted to ask: If Sharon gets here before I'm back from Rikers, can you make sure she's comfortable?
And also, um Keep Captain Holt away from her.
Really?
Why?
He's always weird around her and it stresses her out.
She says he reminds her of those judgmental trees from "Lord of the Rings".
They're called "Ents".
Get a life, dweeb.
- I don't care.
- Okay.
Can you handle it?
Yes, I can totally handle it.
I will take care of Sharon.
As long as she's carrying my godchild inside of her, I am her god-husband.
She is my god-wife.
And I will god-love her forever.
Come on, man.
Don't say stuff like that.
Which part?
All of it?
I'm gonna assume it's all of it, and just make my exeunt.
Okay.
Don't hurt me.
Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
This year, I'm more thankful than ever to have you as my Captain.
And I'm thankful for the low price of gasoline.
And I'm thankful for the friendship I think there's been a misunderstanding.
There's no time for everyone to have a turn.
But I'm the only one that didn't get to Boyle.
Now, with the internet being down, we'll have to do all the paperwork by hand.
Would you two be okay with staying late tonight?
Well, I was gonna slow-cook a goose, but I guess I could normal cook her.
Great.
The bullpen is getting overcrowded, and I don't want the situation to deteriorate.
I'm sorry if this ruins your holiday.
Nonsense.
I'm thankful that you trust us with such an important task.
And I am thankful to have such a dedicated employee.
- And I'm thankful - Dismissed.
Yep.
Hey, Gina.
I need a top secret favor.
Sharon is coming to the precinct and I need your help.
Uh, it better not be pregnancy-related, 'cause that crap is nasty.
The miracle of life?
Dress it up however you want, that's some disgusting animal kingdom nonsense.
Okay, don't worry about Sharon.
I'll take care of her.
I've got everything she needs.
Pillow, blanket, copy of "Breast-Feeders" magazine which, now that I say it out loud, sounds like porn.
Yep, it is.
So what do you need me for?
Keeping Captain Holt away from her.
Terry says he gets very awkward near Sharon.
Hmm.
That's one way to put it.
Ah, Sharon.
Nice to see you.
You look so big.
Like a mighty truck.
I can help you avoid Captain Holt.
I'll keep you appraised of his location at all times.
- Gina.
Peralta.
- He's behind me.
Yeah.
I love paperwork, but this is crazy.
There isn't even time to savor it.
Charles, you're going so fast.
I don't have a choice.
We can't let this place fill up with perps.
Yeah, but you're gonna cramp.
Are you kidding, baby?
I've been cramping for the past 20 minutes.
I'm so attracted to you right now.
Sharon.
Mrs. Sarge, how are you?
Very pregnant.
Is Terry back yet?
Not yet, but he will be back any minute, and in the meantime, I will take great care of my godchild and my god-wife.
Oh, yes.
Terry did tell me that you might be calling me that.
Aww.
You guys talk about me?
Sharon!
Hello.
Oh.
Raymond.
Hi.
Um, Captain, I need you to sign this here and here.
Excuse me, everyone.
We got to keep this area clear.
If you could all proceed in a wall-like fashion to the briefing room.
- Oh, oh, oh - That's it.
- Also, right here.
- Human blockade style.
And here, and here, and here.
Uh, give me one second, Gina, I just want to say hi to Sharon.
Just, um Sharon is gone.
Gina?
Is also gone.
Well, Sharon is happy, and Captain Holt has no idea where she is.
Damn, we are good at stashing pregnant ladies.
Guys?
My water just broke.
Don't worry about that, we'll just get you another one.
Oh, you mean your body water!
That's much worse.
Okay, Terry.
I love you.
Just hurry back.
I love you too, baby.
Put Jake on, okay?
Hey there, Sarge.
Everything is totally under control.
As you know, her water broke and she's had a couple of contractions.
And hey, Sharon, how are you doing vaginally?
What?
- Don't ask her that!
- Okay.
Jake, all you have to do is keep her comfortable.
- I'm on my way.
- Okay, sounds good.
And do you want to just meet us at the hospital or No hospital!
Okay.
Got it.
Got it.
Cool, cool, cool.
No hospital.
I am picking up what you're screaming down.
We had a terrible experience when Cagney and Lacey were born.
Last time we went to the hospital, they pushed me to have a C-section, didn't have enough rooms, and the anesthesiologist was a med student who stabbed me in the spinal cord ten times before he got it right!
See?
Needles in your spine?
Childbirth is a horror movie.
That is not helping.
Jake, there's a copy of our birth plan on my desk.
- Call the doula.
- Copy that.
I will call the doula.
Which is a thing that I definitely know what it is.
A doula is someone who supports you emotionally and physically and coaches you through the process.
Oh, I see.
So sort of like a vaginal Gandalf?
Stop saying that word!
Ooh, that's actually a pretty good analogy.
Well, Sharon liked it, Sarge.
All right, listen, you have nothing to worry about.
I've got it totally under control here.
Love you, bye.
Great.
So I'm gonna go get your birth plan and then summon your wizard.
Oh, Sharon, I heard you had gone into labor in our police station.
I hope you don't contract an infection.
Yeah, we all hope that.
Hey, Cap-i-tan, Could I speak with you outside for just one moment?
Don't leave me.
Listen, you've got your plate full today, and this whole Sharon having a baby thing is honestly beneath you.
But I know a lot about childbirth.
My ex-boyfriend, Frederick was an OB/GYN and we would often talk about his work.
Before he started talking about it with Dave.
Well, you should probably know that I also have a lot of experience with childbirth.
And, with a final grunt, the mighty rhino expels her calf.
Ugh!
Gross!
Come out of an egg next time.
I'm gonna go check in on Sharon.
Make sure she's not pushing prematurely fatiguing the uterus.
Okay, wait, you can't talk to her!
Terry doesn't want you in there.
You make her uncomfortable.
I make her uncomfortable?
Well, that's ridiculous.
I should go confront her about this at length.
No, wait!
You could, but I think that would probably stress her out and we're trying to keep her calm right now.
So maybe just Focus on work?
Of course.
I only want to help.
Whatever's best for Sharon.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
You're fine with that?
Absolutely.
I don't take it personally.
nobody else not Hitchcock or Scully, but yeah, I'm fine.
What a joyous occasion.
So Sharon's water just broke.
Are you kidding?
Let's go!
Hold up.
This guy knows where our murderer is hiding.
Just give me two minutes alone with him.
I'll let him know what's gonna happen to him if he doesn't cooperate.
I'm gonna miss the birth of my child!
It's a magical moment!
Okay, okay!
I'll tell you everything.
Thank you for letting me be part of this wonderful experience.
You're a terrible person, but you're welcome.
There you go.
All right.
Safe and sound.
So I spoke with your doily - Doula.
- So close.
And, unfortunately, she is out of town for Thanksgiving.
What?
I also spoke with your backup doula, who is in town.
Oh, thank God.
But is assisting with another birth.
Ugh!
Should not have paused between those two sentences.
- Yeah.
- Jake, where's Terry?
I don't know, exactly, but everything is okay.
I have familiarized myself with the soothing section of your birth plan, and I will now speak in a low, calming, Barry White voice.
Oh, yeah.
Just breathe, baby.
You're making me more tense.
Yeah, I get why.
I'm doing a bad, bad job, girl.
How about we put on some relaxing music?
I think that Terry's got some CDs on his desk.
Oh, great.
Hey, Gina, can you grab those?
I have made the mistake of looking at the birthing plan and just learned what an episiotomy is.
I'm gonna need 90 minutes.
Okay.
I'll grab the CDs.
Be right back.
Oh, hey, sir, thank you again for letting us use your office.
I'm fine.
I'm getting a lot of work done here at Gina's desk.
It's wonderful.
She has all my favorite chewing gums.
Okay, well, I'm just getting some CDs from Terry's desk to help relax Sharon.
I don't know why you're telling me.
I'm not involved.
You made that very clear.
All right.
- Do you work here?
- I do.
My son was arrested six hours ago, and nobody can tell me when he's getting out.
What is going on?
Uh-huh.
Yup.
Great question.
I will be right with you folks.
Guys, we have clear some of these people.
I'm trying to keep things calm for Sharon, and this is not helping.
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm already writing dangerously fast.
It's Smudge City here, Jake.
Smudge City!
I mean, the problem is, we only have one fax machine, and it takes four minutes per page.
It's Logjam City, Jake.
Logjam City!
Well, Sharon is about to have a baby, all right?
So I need it to be Calm City in here.
Calm City!
Hey, if you need more fax machines, there's a ton of them in that storage room where I go to take a nap.
What?
Why didn't you say something?
And once again, Hitchcock and Scully save the day.
You didn't do anything.
It was all Scully.
We're a package deal, everyone knows that.
Why is this train stopped?
I'm freaking out!
Sorry for the delay, but it turns out there's an exciting reason: The train in front of us has a pregnant woman on board, and she's giving birth.
Oh, don't applaud that!
Hey, this is terrible!
I'm sorry, but my wife is giving birth right now too!
No, that's not what I want!
It feels real forced.
Move this train!
All right, so I was unable to get the CDs, however, I can sing you a very soothing tune.
Something like When I get that feeling I need sexual healing Oh boy.
What is that?
Is there a fire?
All right, I'm gonna go check this out.
Sharon, you stay here and prepare to jump out the window.
That came out weird.
Guys, what the hell is going on?
Hitchcock and Scully saved the day.
No, you plugged ten fax machines into one outlet and caused a fire.
But I pointed to the fire extinguisher and was like, "The fire extinguisher's over there".
You pointed at the toaster oven!
You guys, the alarm is freaking out Sharon.
Does anyone know how to turn it off?
There's an override switch switch in my office above the thermostat.
Great.
Can you turn it off?
Yes, I'd love to help out.
Perhaps you'd like me to wear a bomb suit with an opaque visor so Sharon doesn't know that it is I who Just forget it.
I'll do it!
Oh, good.
You didn't jump.
What's going on?
Is everything okay?
Yes, I just need to flick this switch and turn off the old alarm-a-roono.
Oh, must've been the wrong switch.
But this one Turns on the sprinklers.
And apparently, does not turn them back off.
Guys.
What's going on?
I thought you were gonna clear the room?
They won't listen to us.
They're hungry and pissed and they all hate cops.
Would you guys just fix the paperwork problem?
I'll take care of this.
Excuse me, everyone.
Everyone, I'm gonna need you all to clear the room.
This woman is having vaginal contractions.
It's just "contractions," you don't have to add "vaginal" to it.
Oh, sorry.
This woman is having non-vaginal contractions.
Everyone out, please.
That was better, right?
- Get you down - Thank you.
Thank you.
All right, Sharon.
Things are about to get very calm in here, all right?
Look at me.
You're gonna be so relaxed, that baby's gonna pop right out onto the floor, you won't even notice.
Don't let my baby touch the floor!
Right, right!
Because of the filth.
Where is Terry?
I don't know.
His phone's going straight to voice-mail.
Maybe we should go to the hospital.
No hospital!
Yeah, no hospital, baby.
I will be right back.
Sir?
I need your help.
I knew this moment would come, and I will be the bigger man.
I'd be happy to help.
Great.
We need a doctor here immediately.
We have to get your ex-boyfriend.
I will not help you.
Things did not end well between Frederick and me.
Ooh, why not?
Dish, sir, dish.
Gina, no.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but we simply don't have time to hear about the captain's sordid romantic past.
What have you become?
A hero in a time of crisis.
You stay here and take care of Sharon.
Ugh.
What if she's still pregnant when I get in there?
Then you'll deal with it.
Sir, we're going to get Frederick right now.
I'm sure he's over whatever little fight you guys had.
Frederick?
Happy Thanksgiving.
Huh.
Six more miles.
Run, Terry, run!
Think of your wife in the care of Jake!
Sarge, look!
Aw, hell yeah!
Terry is terrified!
It's no use, they're all ruined.
No email, now no fax.
What're we gonna do?
I'll tell you what my dad used to tell me: "When the going gets tough, "the pill bug curls into a ball and pretends to be dead".
You think we should pretend to be dead?
You asked for a solution, I gave you one.
Hitchcock, Scully, how did you get things done before the internet and faxing?
Cocaine?
Right.
And also the tubes.
There's 27 miles of pneumatic tubes under the city, connecting all the precincts.
Guys.
You really think these still work?
Oh, I think they still Okay, I found you a pillow.
Full disclosure, it's Scully's hemorrhoid donut I don't want that near my baby.
Yeah, that's the right call.
Okay, I'm gonna go Howard Hughes my hands.
I am so uncomfortable.
Can we please try one of my positions from my birth plan?
Okay.
Think positive thoughts.
You're in a Channing Tatum movie.
You're in a Channing Tatum movie.
I don't like Channing Tatum.
I'm not talking to you.
Please don't slam the door again.
We have a bit of a medical situation.
Well, I wish I could help, but unfortunately, I have a bit of a wooden duck situation.
Excuse me, what now?
Still on about the duck, Frederick?
Years ago, when we moved in together, an antique duck decoy of his was misplaced.
It wasn't misplaced.
You threw it in the trash.
And with it, our relationship.
Oh, please.
We had other problems.
Or have you forgotten about Dave?
Dave and I were coworkers and nothing more.
Nothing more.
Right?
Problem solved, everybody's friends.
Let's go help Sharon.
I will be happy to assist you if you will just admit, Raymond, that you threw my decoy in the garbage.
That will never happen because it's not true.
Thank you for nothing.
Good day.
Hi.
Would you mind just standing there with your glorious beard for one moment?
I'll be right back.
What the hell?
Just tell him what he wants to hear.
But it's a lie.
I don't give a crap, sir.
Sharon needs a doctor, so get over yourself.
Tell him you threw away his stupid duck, then give him 20 bucks to buy a new one.
It cost $740.
What?
That is an insane price for a duck!
That's way too much!
All right, now I'm angry about the wrong thing.
Look, just fix this for Sharon.
Frederick, the duck was ugly and gross and I threw it in the garbage.
Wow.
Well, I know what I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving: The truth.
My phone's ringing!
Oh Oh no!
No!
Terry's still not answering his phone.
Why am I the only one who cares about this baby?
Hey, what took so long?
Is she okay?
Yeah, I was just telling her the entire duck story, now that it finally has a satisfying ending.
No, everything's fine, but I am a little concerned about Sharon's blood pressure.
And this is a terrible environment.
I wouldn't call it terrible.
We're surrounded by criminals, there's no bed, and you can hear the faint sound of someone screaming through all the vents.
That's Hitchcock.
His arm's stuck in a pneumatic tube.
It's hilarious.
In my professional opinion, Sharon should go to the hospital.
Hey.
So the doctor thinks we should go to the hospital.
No hospital!
Yup, I thought you might say that.
Look, I can't get a hold of Terry.
Ugh, that one was rough.
Oh, maybe I should listen to the doctor.
What do you think?
Sharon, it doesn't matter what I think.
You and the sarge have a plan.
Yeah, but the plan changed, like, five horrible things ago.
I'm in a lot of pain.
I mean, I know we said no hospital, but I don't want to risk anything by making a stupid mistake.
Look, you're my god-husband.
We both know that's a fake position.
Not anymore.
What would you do?
Where is she?
- Where's Sharon?
- Room 41B.
Look, I'm sorry.
I know you said Don't go to the hospital!
I tried calling you, you didn't pick up.
So you decided to do the exact opposite of the one thing I told you?
I thought it was the right thing to do, Terry.
Look, she's in there with Captain Holt's ex-boyfriend right now, but don't worry, I made him promise to stop bringing up the duck.
What the hell are you talking about?
- I - You know what?
I'll deal with you later.
Seems like you already dealt with me.
I got the gist, we're good.
Peralta, can I confess something to you?
I didn't throw Frederick's duck in the garbage.
Yes, I know, sir.
I didn't throw the duck in the garbage.
I threw it off a bridge.
Why would you do that?
Well, Frederick and I were having problems.
He knew I disliked the duck because of its weak beak, but he insisted on displaying it anyway.
I acted out in a petty manner.
Just as I did today.
I'm sorry that I wasn't more helpful.
It's fine, I understand.
You might find this hard to believe, but I can be a little childish sometimes, myself.
Yes.
You have gum in your hair right now.
- Noted.
- Hey!
Hey!
You guys came.
What about all the paperwork?
We got it all in.
Filed 900 forms by hand in under 12 hours.
It was tough, but worth it.
We wouldn't have missed this.
Also, we had to go to the ER anyway.
Hitchcock's arm was mangled by the tube.
I'm in unspeakable pain.
Oh.
Ugh, this is agonizing.
It's been over an hour.
This has to be a record for longest childbirth.
It's a girl!
Her name is Ava Jeffords.
She's 14 pounds, six ounces.
Whoa.
Oh yeah, Terry Jeffords makes big babies.
Guys, I just want to say thanks to all of you.
Charles and Amy filling out forms.
Rosa, I'm so thankful you got me here on that bike.
I'm thankful I could help.
I'm thankful that I'm Boyle, this is clearly a moment between him and Diaz.
Captain Holt, you brought me the doctor that brought my girl into the world.
And Gina, I know you got past your fears and helped Sharon out.
I'm so happy for you and I never want to see your daughter or remember this day.
And Hitchcock and Scully, I assume you're here for some unrelated injury.
That's correct.
Jake.
Can I see you for a minute?
Oh.
Yeah.
It's a girl.
Ouch!
Worth it.
Sharon and I wanted you to be the first person to meet Ava.
Oh, wow.
She's beautiful.
I'm sorry I got angry earlier.
You did a great job today.
Hospital was the right decision.
I'm so glad you're Ava's godfather.
I'm so glad you're Sharon's god-husband.
I'm so glad you're my god-wife.
I have no idea what I'm saying at this point.
Thank you, Jake.
You want to hold her?
Oh, um Yeah, sure, that'd be great.
The baby, Jake!
Yeah!
Right, right, the normal thing.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
My fellow detectives, ours is not an easy job.
The hours are long.
The danger is constant.
The pay is LOL.
But today, a glimmer of hope.
For today a new vending machine.
Behold him in all of his glory.
So full of strength and promise, and most importantly, sodium, gluten, and fat.
- Whoo!
- The time has finally come to christen the machine.
- Boyle, the champagne?
- Oh, well, technically it's a Hungarian Pezsgo from the Tarnok Valley.
For once in your life, don't ruin it.
Give him the bottle.
Thank you.
I hereby christen thee Snacky Chan!
Whoa!
Okay, well, at least it was just the keypad.
None of the snacks got messed up.
Whoa!
- Go!
- Oh, right!
Okay, okay.
No!
It should've been me.
It should've been me!
Our perp's name is Karl Ove.
My CI said he's selling counterfeit caviar out of a blue stall.
This place smells like a squid farted inside a whale's butt.
Yes, that is the exact combo of smells.
Nicely done.
Hey, next week is my six-month anniversary with Amy.
Should I do something special?
You know what I like about our relationship, Jake?
We don't talk about our love lives, or our families, or anything that's on our minds.
It's why you're my closest friend in the world.
Yeah, I know, but I need help on this.
I asked Boyle and he was useless.
Put a baby in her, Jake.
What are you waiting for?
So do that then.
Problem solved.
Look, it's our guy.
Excuse me, sir, we're with the NYPD.
I just need to ask you a couple of Oh, shrimp!
I hate that!
You're under arrest, punk.
Nobody gets away from Jake Per ew!
Something yucky touched me!
Ugh, gross, gross, gross!
Hang on.
What's that?
What have we here?
What?
I have no idea what you're saying.
Just as I suspected immediately.
It's a flawless 39-carat diamond that was stolen six weeks ago from the Royal Stockholm Museum.
I've just received word from Interpol that two detectives are on their way from Sweden to pick up the suspect.
Please make them feel welcome.
Welcome?
We're gonna roll out the fricking red carpet.
Working a jewel heist with Interpol?
This is the best thing that's ever happened to me!
- Second best.
- Aww.
First best.
I was lying to Amy.
Do you guys know anyone who wants some used textbooks?
I'd love them.
It's never too late to teach yourself something new So no one.
Great.
Why are you throwing those out?
Because I'm never gonna pass this astronomy final, so I won't graduate, so my life is ruined.
Or we could help you study.
I did graduate magna cum laude from Syracuse.
I know that sounds like a brag.
And it was!
Terry killed it in college.
Plus, I know a thing or two about astronomy.
I had 11 straight birthdays at the planetarium.
That was also a brag.
My God, you guys are such pathetic nerds.
But maybe that's what I need right now, pathetic nerds.
Okay.
You pathetic nerds can help me.
Thank you?
You are so welcome.
Peralta, Diaz.
This is Inspector Knausgaard and Deputy Inspector Carlsson.
Their flight here was eight hours.
It's been a pleasure talking with you about the duration of your flight.
Good day.
Well, there goes my opening question about how long your flight was.
It was eight hours.
Yeah, no, I got that.
I was joking, sorry.
It must have got lost in translation.
No, we understand you perfectly.
Everyone in Sweden speaks English.
We also speak Norwegian, Dutch, German, French, Russian, and Finnish.
But not Danish.
That is a garbage language for garbage people.
- Yeah.
- Oh, word up.
Well, I have almost memorized "Gangnam Style" phonetically, so samesies.
I don't know this word.
"Samesies"?
From context, I believe it means "proudly uneducated".
- Ah.
- So - No.
- Where's our prisoner?
Being processed.
But, in the meantime, may I offer you some of the finest cuisine in Brooklyn from my favorite restaurant?
The food cart outside the precinct.
It's really good.
Hm, none for Soren.
He's allergic to lactose, gluten, and tomato ketchup.
- Oh.
- Also, none for Agneta.
She and her husband are trying to have another baby, so she can't eat anything that will alter her cervical pH.
Oh.
You guys are real close, huh?
In Sweden, we believe for a proper team to function, partners must be completely open with each other.
Yeah.
We have no secrets.
Not even our bodies.
We sauna together all the time.
Yeah, well, we are also very close.
One time, Rosa saw me in my bathing suit.
No, I didn't, you told me to turn around.
- Yeah.
- Well, uh, since we cannot eat your disgusting street food, could you please check if our prisoner has been processed?
Yeah, we don't mean to offend, it's just this place is filthy and you both seem unprofessional.
Unprofessional?
Well, we were going to take you to our favorite laser tag place, but now, you're officially uninvited.
Rosa.
Ah, Boyle.
Just the man we were looking for.
Kevin has accepted a fellowship to teach at the Sorbonne for the next six months.
Oh, I love Paris.
At least how it's represented in the movie "Ratatouille".
- Uh - The rodent chef.
Ah, yes.
Farfetched.
Anyway, Kevin and I belong to the Park Slope Racquet Club, where we've established a squash doubles dynasty.
We've taken home the trophy two years in a row.
Unfortunately, I'll be flying to Paris this year during the tournament.
It's a seven-hour flight.
I remember you told me you played in college.
Three-time intramural champion at Sarah Lawrence.
Would have been four, but senior year I played Greaseball in our school's production of "Starlight Express".
Interesting casting.
In any case, I would be honored if you would take my place so that Raymond could make it a treble.
Absolutely!
I would love to do that!
- Great.
- Formidable.
Yup!
That is great.
This is great.
- This is terrible.
- Why?
You always said you wanted more face time with Holt.
No, not like this.
Squash brings out my competitive side.
Breaking racquets, cursing, excessive mooning.
One time, just to psych a guy out, I locked eyes with him and ate a squash ball.
That's not possible.
It's still in me, Terry.
Look, the point is to have fun.
So just relax and have fun.
Right, right, right, yeah.
It's just a game.
It's fun.
There's no need for Holt to see me unleash the beast.
Okay.
That's a strange little man.
Probably telling Captain Holt how much they like - to sauna together.
- Please.
They think they're so great just 'cause they know each other's allergies.
You know what I'm allergic to?
- Yup.
Them.
- Totally.
And also bees.
You should know that.
If I got stung by a bee, I could die.
Detectives, I've been talking with the inspectors.
There's been a development in the Kottbullediamant case.
Excellent pronunciation, Captain.
Tack.
They believe our perp may have smuggled more stolen Swedish diamonds into Brooklyn.
Oh, well, thank you for the tip.
Have a wonderful flight home.
We will send you the jewels as soon as we find them.
They're staying and working the case with you.
Ah, fantastic.
Rosa, could you please fill my car with a million bees?
Okay, since the Swedes are rudely late, let's talk anniversary gift.
Should I get Amy something caszh like shot glasses, or something less caszh, like golden shot glasses?
Still don't care.
How about I get a jump on our new partners and search the perp's apartment?
Right.
We'll get some clues, solve the case, make them look like fools.
They can eat our American dust.
No, no.
Soren is probably allergic to dust.
Oh, hello!
Yes, I am allergic to dust.
Everyone is.
That's what sneezes are.
You're what sneezes are.
Okay.
What are you guys doing here?
Oh, in Sweden, we call it police work.
Perhaps you don't have a word for it?
- I hate you.
- This is our case.
You can't work it without us.
Get your weird, hairless fingers off of it.
Soren shaves his fingers for cycling.
It cuts down on drag.
Agneta is my biggest fanatic.
Just as I am a fanatic of her slam poetry.
- Would you like to hear some?
- Would I like to?
- I would hate to!
- Your loss.
Well, we've already searched the entire apartment.
Yeah, well, now we're gonna search it, and find things you all missed, like this!
Your own keys?
Damn straight.
Bag 'em, Diaz.
Astronomy is full of interesting facts.
For instance, here's one that Hollywood doesn't want you to know.
A parsec is actually a measure of distance.
One of the many inaccuracies in the "Star Wars" universe.
Uh-huh.
And what's "Star Wars"?
Oh, boy.
Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.
Okay, let's talk planets.
Jupiter is a gas giant.
So is Hitchcock.
How does this help me?
It also has 67 moons.
I came up with a fun mnemonic device to remember them all.
It goes, "Every Individual Gets Crayons "After Telling His Aggressive "Little Mongoose Painter Called Ernest "Some Lies About Tiny Panda Heads period "Maybe One Kid Could Take Her Elephant Into California, Except" Where's Gina?
She told me you called me a gas giant.
Well, now you and I will never hook up.
Uh-oh.
What's this?
A little piece of evidence that evaded your bald little hands.
A shipping manifest that was shoved into the back of a drawer.
Our perp transferred a container to a shipyard in Bay Ridge on October 11th.
That arrived over a month ago, I doubt you'll find anything in it.
Please, you're just pissed we cracked the case wide open and you've got nada.
That's right, I speak Spanish.
Actually, we've got much more than nada.
Damn it, he speaks Spanish too.
Agneta found an invitation to a party tonight at the home of Alvar Gustavsson.
The hot blond guy from "True Blood"?
No, the Swedish millionaire with ties to organized crime.
- Alvar Gustavsson.
- Yeah.
Oh, that Alvar Gooz-hev-vren.
Well, you're welcome to pursue that dead-end lead while we got to the shipping container and find the jewels.
And maybe to celebrate, Rosa will wear them to your dumbass party.
No, they're priceless, please do not do that.
Yeah, obviously we wouldn't.
We were just being jerks.
See you later, jerks.
- Okay.
- Bye, Jake.
Bye, Rosie.
Whoo!
You ready, Boyle?
- Psyched up?
- No, why?
Do I seem psyched?
'Cause I'm definitely not.
I just want to have fun.
And to win.
Hey, if we all have fun and don't throw any racquets and don't eat squash balls, then we're all winners.
- What?
- Nothing.
I'll serve.
- Out.
- What?
Are you out of your mind?
That was fun.
That was a fun call.
You're a real fun guy, fun guy.
This is fun!
This is fun!
Gina!
I know astronomy can seem a little daunting and scientific, but I have a friend who I think can make it pretty interesting.
Who dis?
Hi, Gina, I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson.
And I care, why?
Director of the Hayden Planetarium.
One of the world's leading astrophysicists.
And he's doing me a huge favor.
And how do you know Terrance, Space Tie?
We're gym buddies.
Damn, Neil deGrasse Tyson!
How are you doing that?
It's physics, Terry.
It's physics.
Gina, look.
Give me two hours.
You'll not only pass your exam, you'll gain a deeper appreciation of the universe through which we journey on this spaceship Earth.
Spaceship Earth?
Way to go.
You just made Earth lame, and that is my house.
Gina, why did you want to take astronomy?
Because I thought it would be cool, just me, sitting around naming moons left and right, like "Zorp," "Bong," "Dingo".
"Etcetera," that would be one of the names.
"Etcetera".
She's gonna fail, isn't she?
- Big time.
- Yeah.
According to the shipping company, the container that came in on October 11th is 34G1.
Cool.
Hey, what did you and Marcus do for your six-month anniversary?
Keeping in mind, that he's dreamy and romantic and I only own $50.
- Marcus and I broke up.
- What?
When?
- A month ago.
- A month ago?
How do I not know about this?
Because we don't talk about that crap.
We're not lame like the Swedes.
Right.
Yeah, totally.
If Agneta broke up with her husband, she'd probably be all, "Oh, Soren, I am so heartbroken," and he'd be like, "What can I do to help?
I'm sorry," and give her a big old hug and she'd be all feeling better like an idiot.
We don't need to do that because what we do together is solve crimes.
You know it.
For example Boom.
We are about to uncover a butt-load of diamonds.
Exactly.
It's fish!
It's fish, Rosa!
Ugh.
Swedes.
Oh, hello, Jake.
You missed quite a party.
The blond man from "True Blood" was there.
- Very cool guy.
- So cool.
Yeah, that's cool.
Hey, this is weird because I hate you guys, but can I ask you a question?
If you broke up with your husband, would you tell Soren about it?
Are you making a funny laugh joke right now?
I would insist he be there for it so that my husband would have a shoulder to cry on.
Yeah, several years ago, Agneta and Lars were having trouble conceiving.
She didn't even have to ask me to donate my sperm.
I had it already in a "Tooperware," ready to go.
Wow, that's so gross, yeah.
Can we ask you a question?
- Mm-hm.
- Why do you smell like fish?
Is it hygiene?
No, we spent the night cutting open hundreds of dogfish to see if they had diamonds inside.
- Did they?
- Wouldn't you like to know?
Yeah.
It would be pertinent to the case.
They didn't.
Although, one did have a battery in it.
What kind of a sicko feeds a battery to a fish?
Well, while you were wasting your time, we set up a meeting on 14 November with the man we think is the buyer.
- Um - No, don't worry, Soren.
I rescheduled your cycling practice for 16 November, and your dentist for 19 November.
You know me so well.
Ugh.
Those guys suck.
They're so into each other, they're probably gonna start holding hands.
Oh, they're actually holding hands.
Yeah, they are awful, for sure.
All tall and beautiful, and you don't want to know what they've got in their "Tooperware".
But honestly, I don't know that it's that bad that they're close.
- Wrong, it's the worst.
- Okay.
Oh, my God, I just figured out where the diamonds are.
We thought the shipping container came in on October 11th, write their dates backwards.
We should've been going through the one from 10 November.
Of course!
Stupid rest of the world, writing their date all dumb.
- Yeah.
Let's go.
- Okay.
Boyle.
Is everything okay, you know, with your brain?
Yeah.
I'm great.
I'm having a lot of fun.
Yes, I've heard you say that 162 times.
You do realize, that if we lose this next match, we're out of the tournament?
Yes, but the important thing is we had a good time.
No!
The important thing is that we win the trophy.
Because I promised Kevin before he left for Paris that we would do that.
Do you know why I chose you as my partner?
Because I'm the most athletic person you know?
No, because of an article I read in the "Sarah Lawrence Phoenix" about a young man they called "squash's unhinged lunatic".
I don't know what you're talking about.
According to that article, that lunatic was 27-0.
I need him on my team.
I need you to unleash the beast.
Take a ride on the wild side Whoo!
You butternuts ready to get squashed?
"Huh?
What?
Duh"?
That's you guys while I smoke your butts, because Ray-Ray and the Beast don't even give a what.
We don't give a what.
Unh-uh.
Whoo!
Let's do this.
Boo-ya-kah, suckers!
Wild side - Yeah!
- Ohh!
What?
You kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
Yes!
- Whoo!
- Ow!
Way to go!
That's it, baby!
Gina, great news.
Oh, no.
Is Neil deGrasse Tyson here?
He will not stop trying to friend me.
No, but we think we figured out how you're gonna pass your test.
Yeah, we realized that we were trying to get you to learn using our methods.
We should've been speaking your language.
The language of Dance!
there was nothing.
And then the big bang!
Yes!
Now, Amy, back up till you feel the wall.
And, Terry, ditch the shirt.
I'm ready to learn.
And that's how you calculate parallax distance.
So you ready for the test?
Oh, I took it this morning.
I passed.
What?
It was nice how much you guys cared, so I actually opened up my textbook for the first time.
Ya'll, astronomy is kind of interesting.
And I am hella smart.
Then why'd you make us do that whole dance?
Two reasons: Uno and dos.
I get that.
One-two, one-two, one-two, one-two.
Ha-ha!
I guess we are the better team.
Why do people like these things?
They're just shiny rocks.
Yeah, totally.
You should be happier.
We found the jewels, we won.
Yeah, you're right.
We should celebrate.
Why don't we go to a bar and drink in silence?
Cool.
Sounds good.
No, I was being a bitch.
How did you not pick up on that?
What is your problem, man?
Is this about your stupid anniversary present?
Yeah, that, and you not telling me about Marcus.
We're supposed to be friends.
You sound like Soren or Agneta, whichever the boy one is.
Well, say what you want about them, but at least they communicate, you know?
I've never even heard your slam poetry, Rosa.
Why do you all of a sudden care about every single little detail of my life?
Because all we talk about is cop stuff.
All right, and that was fine when we were 20 because that's all I cared about.
But we're adults now and there are other things, like me and Amy and you and Marcus, that friends are supposed to talk about.
Well, I guess we're not friends then.
Wow.
All right, I guess we're not.
Oh, uh-oh.
- We're moving.
- Oh, really?
Thank you for sharing that intimate detail about your life.
- Jake.
- I know, we're screwed.
I was being a bitch again!
All right, I called for backup.
I also texted all of my friends.
You'll notice your phone didn't buzz.
I think we're in Red Hook.
- We're not on the BQE anymore.
- Nice try, Rosa.
Don't try to kiss up to me by mentioning my third-favorite New York expressway.
Shut up!
We pulled into a parking lot.
Things are about to go down.
Backup won't make it here in time.
It's just me and you.
I heard two voices in the truck.
There'll be more if there's a meet-up.
- Go word is "Glurg".
- Copy that.
Flergen!
Come on, is that you?
I haven't seen you since Blorgenbergen, man!
Who the hell are you?
Give me a hand, you old dummy.
It's me, Glurg.
NYPD!
Drop it!
Drop it, you're under arrest.
I hope they have saunas in Swedish prison.
They do, actually.
- They're quite nice.
- Oh.
Kevin, there's something we'd like to show you.
Ta-da!
Ah, magnifique.
The treble is ours.
I look forward to getting number four next year.
Actually, we've been banned for life from all future tournaments.
Oh, no.
What happened?
My fault, Kevin.
I snapped the second-place trophy over my knee and threw it in a urinal.
- Oh, my.
- Yeah.
But the important thing is, we had fun.
Yeah.
So we'll be taking the jewels back to Sweden tomorrow.
Yeah.
Guess you were wrong about us, huh?
Bet you feel pretty stupid.
Actually, when you're wrong, that means you've learned something.
And any opportunity for learning is good.
Ugh.
You are the absolute worst.
I hope you die in a fjord.
No, no, we are trying to say we are happy - to have worked with you.
- Yeah, I know.
That is an infuriating attitude.
Yeah, I second the fjord thing.
Bye, Jake.
Bye, Rosie.
It's just how they walk around, I guess.
Get your hands off each other, weirdos.
God.
Well Nice job today.
I guess we didn't have to know each other to have each other's backs.
So drink in silence?
This sucks.
We solved the case and told the Swedes how to die.
I should be happy, but I can tell you're bummed, and that's not cool 'cause we are friends.
- Really?
- Yes.
And I thought of what you should do with Amy for your anniversary.
Oh, thank God.
I got her a boogie board.
It has an iguana playing electric guitar on it.
She's gonna hate it.
New York Public Library lets VIPs stay there overnight.
Ooh, that's perfect.
But wait, how do I become a library VIP?
I forgot to return "Superfudge" in the fourth grade, and I've been scared to go back ever since.
Don't worry about it.
I can hook you up.
My new boyfriend works there.
You shared!
What's his name?
No, wait.
- I don't want to push too hard.
- No, it's cool.
I want to tell you his name.
Oh, okay, just gonna take a quick drink break.
Here comes the name.
Nope.
Uno mas.
All righty.
Good Lord.
Putting them away.
I have to imagine these belong to someone else.
It's fine.
Yeah.
- It's Tom.
- I love it!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Come here!
Come here!
Come here!
You got to see this.
I'm about to give Captain Holt his gift.
Oh, did he lift his "no gift" policy?
No, he didn't.
But I figured out a way to buy him something and trick him into accepting it.
- You are bad.
- I know, right?
Oh, wait.
You're making fun of me.
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I don't care.
He would never open a gift, right?
But what if his gift didn't look like a gift?
- He would open it?
- Exactly!
I left it in a cardboard box on his desk.
There's no card, just the words "Open now," which I wrote with my wrong hand so he wouldn't recognize my handwriting.
- Captain.
- Santiago.
Peralta.
Sir.
So just to recap, you left an unmarked package on a police captain's desk on a random Monday, with a suspicious message written on it that looked like it was scrawled by a crazy person.
- Mm-hmm.
- Bomb!
There's a bomb!
Everyone out!
Let's go, let's go!
This is not a drill!
Let's go!
Great gift, babe.
Ho, ho, ho, Jake.
Special delivery from Santa's elf.
Merry Christmas.
Ah.
- Heart Attack soda.
- Holy crap!
I love this stuff!
You know, technically, it's just carbonated fudge.
- I know.
- I thought they banned it.
Not in Syria.
They use it to induce labor in goats.
And your real present arrives tomorrow.
There's more?
Charles, this is too much.
Nonsense!
It was just a lot of time and a lot of money.
Oh.
Gina!
I screwed up.
I forgot to get Charles anything.
Oh, well, I always knew he would die of sadness.
I'm such a selfish jerk.
I was just so focused on Amy's gift that I completely spaced.
His present to me was so personal.
All right, think.
What does Charles love?
Gross food, tan pants, "MasterChef Junior".
Ooh, I could call up one of those kids and offer them a free trip to New York.
I wouldn't do that.
Right, 'cause I'm a stranger, and I shouldn't be luring them out of state.
- Good call.
- Jake, just go to Goodwin's.
They're open late, and they have everything.
Right.
Smart.
Please come with me.
Please, I need help picking something out.
Please, Gina?
I'll take a pic of Terry in the locker room for you.
No towel, with his foot up on the bench.
Towel on, still wet from the shower.
I'm in.
Hey, guys.
What's up?
Nothing.
Diaz, are we still on for the Polar Bear Swim tonight?
It's either that or go caroling with my family, so, yeah.
I'd rather walk into the freezing ocean.
Wait, what?
You guys are doing the polar swim?
Why didn't you ask me?
Oh, we didn't think you'd be interested.
Yeah, you're always cold.
You brought a blanket to a Mets game in mid-July.
This one thinks July 18th is mid-July.
You guys think I'm some kind of wimp, but I'm not.
I am tough, and I'm strong, and I love to splash around in chilly water.
It's not chilly, it's as cold as the waters of Cocytus, the frozen lake of hell.
I'll see you there.
I can't wait to dunk my junk.
Okay, gang.
I'm out.
I'll be back on the 27th.
I've got two days of family time.
Do not attempt to contact me.
I do not want a repeat of last year when Scully called me 50 times on Christmas morning.
No.
I called you once.
My butt called the other 49.
Yeah, well, my brother-in-law Zeke was real judgy about how much my phone was buzzing.
Somebody's got a lot of business to tend to.
Who are you?
Barbara Corcoran?
He didn't even make me one of the good sharks.
I'm clearly Lori.
Nobody call me.
Gina!
It's our first annual Boyle-Linetti Christmas.
Are you excited about going to town on Daddy's nog?
Christmas is cancelled.
Charles ruined it.
I'm gonna be a little late.
I got to help Jake do some shopping.
Oh, last-minute gifts.
Ooh, who didn't make the cut?
Tell me, Jake, who's the poor sack at the bottom of your list?
Actually, Amy.
- Amy?
Oof!
That's bad.
- Mm-hmm.
Just give her whatever you got me.
Really?
But then I wouldn't have a gift for you.
Would you be cool with that?
No, that would eviscerate me.
I'll get my coat.
I'm gonna help you find something for her.
- Oh, that's not necessary.
- Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, Jake.
Also not necessary to touch my face.
It's Christmas.
A time for friendship.
Damn it.
All right.
I guess you'll just have to distract him - when we get to the store.
- On it.
I'll take him to housewares and I'll ask him the difference between a skillet and a frying pan.
- That'll buy you six hours.
- Perfect.
Gina, you just saved Christmas.
It's what I do.
Every damn year.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Wait!
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't lock the door!
I just need to buy one thing.
I'll be so fast, I won't even pay!
How did that not work?
Hey, there's still people in there.
They're not closed.
First time at a retail store, Oliver Twist?
They lock the doors, but if you're still inside, you get an extra 15 minutes to finish up.
Oh, perfect, so we should just try and sneak in an entrance through the back.
Boyle, you'll have to stay here.
It's too dangerous.
No way I let you take that risk alone.
Damn it, you are loyal.
Shall we?
Ohh!
Whereas, with the skillet, the approach to fish skin is completely different.
Uh-huh.
And your spatula technique is completely intuitive.
- Please, tell me more.
- Okay.
I got it.
They're closing.
Let's go.
Oh, let's take a peep at that purchase.
- Cologne?
- Uh, it's perfume.
- For a lady.
Woman.
- It's called "Canyon Stank".
It's got a man riding a burro on it.
Oh, does it?
I didn't notice.
I just like the way it smelled.
I wear this cologne, Jake.
I'm a Stank man.
Um, I don't know, maybe just subconsciously I wanted Amy to smell more like you.
Okay, little creepy, bud.
Coming on real strong.
Wow, the tables have really turned.
Shut up!
Keep walking!
Shoot!
The store is being robbed!
Come here.
All right, just slowly back up.
There's a door behind us.
We just have to get outside and call the Nine-Nine.
Go.
Just head for the vault.
We're good.
- Lock 'em up!
- They're sealing the exits.
Oh, my God.
It's real life "Die Hard".
I mean, "Oh, no!
Crime".
They've taken all the security guards.
I left my gun in my locker.
Are you carrying?
No, mine's at work.
Boyle Christmas charades can get pretty competitive and it's best not to have firearms around.
We don't need guns.
I have a lighter, okay?
We get some hairspray, make some flamethrowers.
- Let's fry these bitches.
- No one is frying any bitches.
Charles, did you call this into dispatch?
Yes, but I can't get in touch with anyone from the Nine-Nine.
Right Amy, Rosa, and Holt are having the time of their lives splashing around in the freezing, filthy ocean.
I'll try Terry.
Thank you for this amazing year.
Thank you for the food in front of us.
And my family, which is my number one priority.
Much more than phones.
Just take the call, Barbara Corcoran.
This better be an emergency.
There better be a gun to your head.
Charles, Gina, and I are in a hostage situation.
Oh, God, I shouldn't have said the gun thing.
Terry regrets the way he answered the phone.
We're at Goodwin's.
There are multiple gunmen.
They've blocked all the exits, they've taken the security guards hostage, and we're looking for a place to hide.
It's awesome.
- Awesome?
- Awesomely serious.
I am not enjoying this, no matter how much it is come to life.
The important thing is keep Gina safe.
You have a civilian with you.
I'm on the way.
Cool.
Oh!
Also bring a pic of yourself in a towel coming out of the shower.
Can't explain why, okay?
Gotta go, bye.
There's a serious situation going down they need my help with.
Did one of your detectives lose his head up his own butt?
You don't even have a job, Zeke!
You know what, I'm not supposed to be bringing this up, but I'm bringing it up!
I'm sick of hearing you got things brewing.
You ask me, the only thing you got brewing is a pot of BS!
Kids, I love you.
Sharon, you are perfect.
Zeke, get a job!
Okay, we should be safe in here.
This place looks good.
Good?
It's great!
Santa's chair.
All right, ESU's on their way.
Our top priority is keeping Gina safe.
Keeping me safe?
I'm gonna help you take these guys down.
No, you're not doing anything like that.
You're not a cop.
I've watched what you do for six years.
It's not that difficult.
"NYPD!
You're under arrest"!
That was clearly an impression of Charles.
But stay here with him while I do some recon.
Wait, shouldn't we all stick together?
Someone has to asses the situation, Boyle.
Plus, we're trapped, on Christmas, with a bunch of bad guys who are very likely German.
This is my John McClane moment.
Okay.
You're gonna need a tank top.
- You can have mine.
- No need.
- I snagged this on the way here.
- "Baby Grrl"?
Yeah, they didn't have the best selection.
I'll probably just skip the tank.
- Yeah.
- I will return.
Okay.
Gina.
You all right?
You look pretty cold.
I'm not.
I'm actually hot.
Hot, and ready to get this super fun thing over with.
- First, a toast.
- Great.
Let's drag this out.
- To the sea.
- To the sea!
Hear, hear!
I wasn't done.
Chill, Amy, let him finish his ocean toast.
Thank you, Rosa.
I'm reminded of a beloved Christmas Carol by English poet Christina Rossetti.
"In the bleak mid-winter, frosty wind made moan, Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone".
Moan, stone, phone.
We get it.
Down the hatch.
Let's get this over with.
Gah!
Weeeeeeeee!
Noooo!
Oh, my God!
Excuse me, Sergeant Jeffords with the Nine-Nine.
I've got two detectives and a civilian in there.
Who's in charge?
I am, ding-dong.
- The Vulture?
- That's right.
It's me.
In the flesh.
Happy Kwanzaa.
Oh, man.
You can't say that.
All right, let's see what we're dealing with.
I'll call you Klaus.
You will be Guenter.
With the little dots over the U. Jurgen.
Hey, Matt.
Are you in position?
I'm here.
Oh, great, the bad guy's name is Matt.
Hey, sorry that took so long.
Gina, you doing okay?
You scared?
I'm scared you won't let me make a flamethrower and use it to throw flame.
You're right.
I will not do that.
You're gonna stay here and keep hiding.
Boyle and I are gonna handle this.
Here's the situation.
Just the way he likes it.
- Who's he?
- Me!
Why are you calling yourself "He"?
Because that's the tagline from the "Die Hard" poster, and also my high school yearbook quote.
Oh, I knew I recognized it.
Next time, lead with that.
Right.
Sorry.
Also, there aren't 12 of them.
There are seven, and they're not terrorists, they're robbers.
They brought drilling equipment to break into the safe.
Okay, so it's really seven robbers, two cops, and one Gina.
- Yes.
Exactly.
- Yeah.
Where's Gina?
Gina?
There she is.
She went for the hairspray.
She is incorrigible.
- Who are you?
Come here.
- No!
No, no, no, no.
Jake, they're taking Gina.
Yeah, I know.
We're looking at the same thing.
What?
They got Gina?
- I told you to watch her!
- I know.
I am so sorry, but I promise you, we will get her back.
Oh, this is bad.
I got to report this to the Vulture.
He's in charge.
Ugh!
The Vulture?
I thought he was on his massage tour of Southeast Asia.
He's leaving tomorrow.
That's why he wants this over quickly.
- He wants to storm the building.
- No!
No, no, no.
That is a bad idea.
Look, we still haven't figured out where they're holding Gina and the rest of the hostages.
If you guys come busting in here, things could go sideways real fast.
That's what I told him, but then he just repeated it back to me in a lady's voice.
Listen to me, Sarge.
Boyle and I can take these guys out one by one and no one will get hurt.
Just ask the Vulture to give me some more time.
He'll be reasonable.
What am I talking about?
It's the Vulture.
Tell him Tila Tequila's doing a free show in Central Park.
Then how come Tila just posted a selfie from the Kid Rock show in Daytona, bro?
Yeah, I follow her.
You know what?
I know what's going on here.
Jake wants to go solo, and he's trying to steal my thunder.
He's inside and he has eyes on the situation.
Look, I'm in command here.
Look around you.
I control all of this.
You see that guy behind you?
That sniper?
He'll shoot whoever I tell him to.
Even you.
- No, I won't.
- Fine.
Then, uh, he'll sit on any rooftop I tell him to.
Hey, go sit on that rooftop, guy.
Look, just give Jake a chance.
If he fails, then you can storm the building.
I'll give him a chance to sit on his little white butt and wait for me to come rescue him.
You tell him that I'm Liam Neeson and he's my hot, dumb daughter.
All right, we're outnumbered and unarmed.
If we're gonna get Gina back, we need weapons.
This place sells hammers, wrenches Do they sell plants?
Because some of that potting soil is very toxic if ingested in large quantities.
So you want to feed the bad guys a lot of soil?
Force-feed 'em.
Okay, that's a good option that I will definitely consider.
Now, let's go out there and gear our asses up.
Quietly.
Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh Make noise, b-boys I'm the nitty, nasty, gritty smashing - Never slow gassing - Fool Strictly swift blast of the raspy-rasp fashion Hit between the eyes, I plan to vandalize I supply the static, I run with the bad guys The villains, crooks, highlighters and the fighters See the big black picture if you look inside of Ho ho ho?
Slam, da duh duh Da duh duh, Let the boys be boys Slam, da duh duh Da duh duh, Make noise, b-boys Slam, da duh duh Da duh duh, Let the boys be boys Slam, da duh duh, da duh duh Hey, Matt.
Oof!
That'll teach you to have a dumb, normal name.
All right, where are you holding the hostages?
Oh, bet you'd like to know, eh?
Canadian?
No!
You're so clearly supposed to be German.
- Are any of you German?
Mm-mm.
- Russian?
Mm-mm.
- North Korean?
- Mm-mm.
Greek?
I don't trust the way the Greeks dance.
No one does.
You there?
Oh.
Uh, yeah, I was oot, but now I'm back, eh?
Meet me in the service corridor.
We've got a situation with the hostages.
Okey dokey, sorry to hear aboot that.
Service corridor.
- That was great, Jake.
- Thanks.
Peralta just texted.
He knows where the hostages are.
He wants 15 more minutes.
And I want my lesbian neighbors to be way hotter than they are, but we can't always get what we want, right?
I'm ordering that raid.
Hey!
Give that back to me.
Are you serious?
I will end your career.
You'll be out there working as a model because, well, you know, you're shredded, and I respect that.
Give me that walkie talkie, now.
Those are my people in there!
You are not gonna give that order!
- Stand down.
- No.
Stand down or I'm gonna make you.
Hey, you turds, get off the roofs and help me!
Get off your roofs!
I can't do it.
I'm a wimp, just like you said.
I didn't say that, and I don't care if you go in.
- Be honest.
You're judging me.
- I'm really not.
I am, a bit.
No lies on Christmas.
Diaz, shall we?
What?
Oh!
Oh.
Guys!
Captain?
Rosa?
Oh, please hear me from land!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh!
Ahh!
Welcome to the frozen Shut your dumb poem mouth!
I'm so sorry.
No, I'm not!
We have a crisis.
We have to go.
Let's go.
Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.
How are we gonna get past them without a gunfight?
I'll tell you how John McClane would do it.
The vents.
Ah, blast the AC, they get chilly, they leave to find sweaters.
No, we're gonna climb through them.
Even better.
Classic use of vents.
Yeah.
I think we're good.
I don't think we're good anymore.
Who's there?
Dave, is that you?
What are we gonna do?
They know we're here.
No, they know I'm here.
Quick, hide.
Go, go, go, go.
Hey, hosers.
It's me, Dave, eh?
Didn't work.
Jake.
Jake!
Jake!
- Ah!
- Are you okay?
Oh, my head hurts.
Probably from being conked on it.
- How are you?
- I'm tied up.
I'm scared.
This guy hasn't stopped farting for the last hour.
I keep telling you, it's not me.
Ramon, do you really want your last words to be a lie?
Those aren't gonna be your last words, Ramon, all right?
We're all gonna be fine.
They're gonna drill into the safe, take the money, and then go.
They don't need to drill into the safe.
They had my ID.
They already have all the cash.
What?
Then why'd they bring all that heavy-duty equipment?
So you're a cop.
- Ah.
- I hate cops.
- They gave me this.
- Nice!
Finally, a good bad guy.
This dude gets it.
Now I'm gonna kill you.
Okay, you took it a little too far.
Maybe scale it back a skosh.
All set down here.
Okay, start loading out.
I just have one piece of business to take care of.
You know, killing a man is not as easy as it sounds.
I've killed ten men.
And that's such a nice, round number.
Wouldn't you agree?
I mean, imagine.
"I've killed 11 people".
It just sounds so cumbersome.
Ooh!
Yippie kayak, other buckets!
Boyle!
You did it!
And you completely botched the catchphrase.
- I'm pretty sure it was right.
- No, but you did great.
Ahh.
All right.
Look, we have to stop the other robbers.
They're escaping with the merch.
How?
Terry's got the place surrounded.
The drill.
It's not for the safe.
They're using it to tunnel out of here.
And those farts Gina kept smelling?
- Uh-huh.
They were Ramon.
- No, it was sewage.
And Ramon.
We have to tell Terry they're escaping through the sewers.
What's a brother got to do to get a wet wipe?
Don't say that.
- Merry Christmas.
- Ho ho ho.
I'm starving.
"I'm starving"?
We had a thing going!
Jake!
Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.
Wow, you were really worried about me?
Mm-hmm, also your face is so warm, and I think I have hypothermia.
Sergeant, we need to talk.
I'm not in trouble for what I did to the Vulture, am I?
You think people will believe he threw himself in the garbage?
No.
But this was a high-pressure situation, and you rose to the occasion.
You may have saved lives tonight.
The squad is my family, and I'll always protect my family.
Except for Zeke.
That deadbeat giant can fend for himself.
There's a Lieutenant's exam coming up, and I think you should take it.
It's the next step to becoming a Captain.
I didn't do anything.
It was all Jake and Charles.
Mm, spoken like a true Captain.
Also, you are in trouble.
You're suspended one week.
But you've got a bright future.
But I'll need your badge and gun.
Hey, buddy.
I couldn't find the cologne you wanted to give Amy, but I did get a Canyon Stank gift set.
It's all three stanks, plus the body spray.
- Oh, wow.
Thanks, Charles.
- Yeah.
Look, I didn't forget Amy's gift.
I forgot yours.
The Canyon Stank was for you.
What?
Why didn't you just tell me?
Oh, because it would have crushed my heart and ruined our friendship.
Good call.
Look, it sucks, and I was selfish.
I should have gotten you something better.
You did.
You surrendered yourself to keep me safe.
Not only that, you sacrificed your John McClane moment.
It should have been you saying, "Yippie kayak, other buckets"!
Ah, I know you have the moral high ground right now, but it still makes me so angry.
Eh.
Anyways, Merry Christmas, buddy.
You too, buddy.
Gina!
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh!
Whoa!
It works!
The flamethrower works!
- Yeah!
- No, Gina, no!
Gina, no!
Somebody take her down!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Peralta, are you eating an italian sub for breakfast?
I am, but Amy said I should eat more veggies so I got extra pepperoncinis.
Smart.
Uh, excuse me.
You need to watch yourself.
I'm sorry cop.
All right, let's everybody just stay calm here.
Or what?
Are you gonna arrest me for dancing?
You call that dancing?
This is dancing.
What is happening?
I'm defusing the situation.
Whoa dancing captain.
Must capture image of a lifetime!
Oh, why is my phone always dead?
I paid $13 for it.
Don't worry, Jakey.
I got it.
Okay.
Oh!
Oh, my hands are covered in butter from making butter.
I'm on it!
Must record, must record!
Camera on.
All right.
Here we go.
Dancing over.
Situation defused.
No!
Jakey!
Hey!
Are you guys wearing one scarf?
Yep, Charles forgot his this morning.
It's actually quite romantic.
I think he did it on purpose.
Uh, let's just say, I definitely did it on purpose.
Now, twirl me, darling!
You got it, sweet potato.
Ah, I can't get away from you.
All right, you guys are adorable.
Tell me everything the doctor says about your uterine climate.
Oh, and also that.
Genevieve and I have big news.
Is this something other people would keep private?
Big time!
We're trying to have a baby!
Oh, wow!
That is awesome.
But wait, Charles, I thought you were sterile.
I distinctly remember you using the phrase Shooting dust.
Yes, thank you for not making me say it.
Yeah, it's true I lost the ability to procreate after the accident.
Drop your weapons!
Yeah, I still don't know why you dove in crotch first.
Thankfully, my ex-wife, Eleanor, made me get a vasectomy a year before that.
As a precaution, I froze some sperm a lot of sperm.
Guy going in after me was like, "Whoa, nice"!
Wow, he sounds like a gross dude.
- Yeah.
- Should we go into work?
- Yes.
- Great.
Hey, so do you think maybe you're rushing into the whole baby thing?
I mean, you guys have only been dating three months.
She's the one, Jake.
I'm done with that playboy lifestyle out till 11:00, drunk on sangria.
I don't want that anymore.
I just want to be a papa.
Okay, yeah, so, hey, this is awesome.
You're gonna have a baby.
I know!
And you're gonna be its best friend.
Ah, well, based on the age diff, maybe more of a fun uncle/mentor.
Baby's best friend.
All right, so nonnegotiable.
Here's the deal, Steven.
We already got you on shoplifting.
Now let's talk about the 200 cloned credit cards in your bag.
I'm not saying anything.
Look, punk, there are two ways we can do this the easy way or the hard way.
Tell him what the hard way is, boss.
Well, first, Steven, we're gonna fill out form 38E-J1, stating noncompliance.
We send it to the DA, but do they process it right away?
No, because they're overwhelmed because Debra's on maternity leave.
So your court date won't be set for six or eight weeks, and even then, you're gonna have to block off the whole day, because they don't give you a specific time.
No, no, it's a window.
Sir Can I talk to you for a second?
I thought we were gonna to try to scare him.
There's nothing scarier than the realities of the municipal court system.
Now, come on; Let's get back in there and tell him about how bad the website is.
Look, I'll talk.
Of course you will.
But I'll only talk to her.
You want to talk to Gina?
Yeah, hi.
Do you sell purple pants?
All right, well, good day, then.
It's not the turnout I was hoping for.
Maybe I should've offered free strudel; Then at least Scully would've come.
There's free strudel?
Where the hell did you come from?
I don't get it.
I am shocked that more people wouldn't want the tutelage of our precinct's nay, our city's most esteemed sergeant.
What do you want, Santiago?
To learn the majestic art of self-defense from our city's nay, our country's Come on, man, out with it!
I want to start class.
Okay, I'm applying for a mentorship program for up-and-coming detectives.
It's called "Star Achieving Mentors, Star Achieving Mentees," or SAM-SAM for short.
Would you write me a recommendation?
Of course I will.
You'd be great.
Thank you, Sarge.
All right, everyone.
Pay attention.
Santiago, I'm gonna come at you, and you're gonna take me down.
You better impress me if you want that recommendation to be good.
I'm gonna try, Sarge.
All right, here we go.
- Oh, no, no!
- My nose!
My nose!
You broke my nose!
Oh, there's so much blood!
I'm so sorry!
Get me a towel!
Okay, all right.
And that's what you get for lying about free strudel.
Karma's a bitch.
Get out of here, Scully!
Case closed, justice served.
Peralta amazing oh, God.
Oh, no, no Charles, Charles!
Your ex-wife is here.
Eleanor?
The destroyer of worlds?
- Why?
- Maybe it's nothing bad.
Maybe some of your mail got sent to her house.
Oh, God, I hope not.
If that happened, she would be livid.
Oh, well, just don't assume the worst.
That's all I'm saying.
Then why did you bring up the mail thing?
I don't Hello, Chunk.
Heard you want your sperm.
You gonna have to go through me.
Oh, no, this is way worse than the mail thing.
What mail thing?
Nothing.
There's no mail thing.
There's no mail thing.
But it's my sperm.
How did you even find out I wanted it?
Because the account's under my name.
Storage facility called me saying that you were looking to make a withdrawal.
So I went ahead and withdrew it for you.
I have all of your sperm.
But you don't even care about it, Eleanor.
I mean, remember?
"Oh, hey, Charles, "I'll never have a baby with you "because I don't love you, and a child's not gonna fix that"!
Oof, when he started doing the silly voice, I thought it was gonna be more fun, but wasn't.
Well, I do not want your DNA.
I want something else.
I hit some dumbass with my car.
Now he's suing me.
What I want is for you to use your badge and your gun to intimidate him into dropping the case.
Wow.
That is so very illegal.
He's not doing that.
I don't care.
You have 48 hours to do so, or I'm gonna take your sperm, and I'm gonna dump it into the East River.
Please don't do that.
And there will never be the possibility of a little pie-faced Charles Boyle, Jr. Proud of it; It's me.
She can't do that.
Can she do that?
Stay calm.
We're gonna talk to a lawyer and get a professional opinion.
Damn.
I can't believe you signed this contract.
The sperm is her legal possession.
It also says that, she and I quote "Owns your dignity".
You initialed right next to that.
Oh, no, Jake, this is a total disaster!
I'll never be happy in my life.
Why are you smiling?
Because this is exactly what we've trained for.
It's a hostage situation, and we're gonna bring your boys home.
All right, Charles, I know that you're freaking out and you think you're never gonna be a father, but don't worry; There's no way I'm gonna let Eleanor do anything to your precious - Boyle oil?
- Ugh, all right, I'm out.
She can do what she wants.
No, no, no, no, no.
We'll just call them hostages.
All right, fine, let's get to work.
Here's what we know about Eleanor.
Oh, my wedding day.
I should've known it was a mistake when she said, "I suppose," instead of, "I do".
Yowch, all right.
Hostage taker: Eleanor Horstweil.
- 42.
- Bank manager.
No priors.
Clean bill of health.
Current husband: Hercules Thikalonos.
Don't bring him into it.
We're actually quite close.
Noted.
You divorced in 2010.
She got the house, both cars, and 85% of your salary going forward.
That's a typo, right?
- It is not.
- How did she get so much?
My lawyer was Hercules.
That's how they met.
That seems real unethical.
Again, lay off Hercules.
He's quite a decent man.
All right, look, we need some sort of bargaining chip.
Is there anything you got in the divorce that she wanted?
Yes Abigail.
I'm gonna just assume Abigail's something super weird.
Nope.
She was our hairdresser.
Ah, okay.
It was awkward for her to see both of us, so she made us choose.
I mean, I couldn't get rid of her.
She's the only stylist in New York that can do this.
Right, and do you think Eleanor still wants Abigail?
I mean, you saw her hair today.
It's all volume, no sheen.
Okay, maybe we can use this.
Time to put on our negotiation faces.
Not too intimidating but always in control.
How's this?
Oh, as if you don't know it's perfect.
Hey, Sergeant.
How are you?
Well, my baby cries at the sight of my face now, so that's great.
I mean, she's a baby; She could be crying at anything.
Nope, she pointed right at my nose and then threw up.
What do you want, Santiago?
I was just wondering if you finished writing that recommendation letter.
It's due pretty soon.
I'm working on it.
It's taking a little while because it's hard to concentrate, what with all the agony.
Okay, well, thank you for still doing it.
If it helps, I brought you some soothing ginger tea.
Will it repair the place where my nose came off my skull?
I don't know, but it's supposed to have healing vapors.
So try inhaling it?
Oh, thank you.
It burns!
- Oh!
- The vapors burn!
I'm sorry!
I'll take it back!
Oh, God, I'm sorry!
I'll get some cold water!
No, no, don't.
I am petrified of you!
All right, remember, this is a negotiation.
We can't let her know how badly you want this.
Jake, what if she destroys the sperm?
She's not gonna do that, Charles, because then she'd have no leverage.
All right, you know this; They never shoot the hostage.
Hey!
Did you threaten that 90-year-old man for me yet?
What?
The guy you hit was 90?
Yeah, and you would know that if you had talked to him, which obviously you did not, so good-bye!
No, no, wait, wait, look.
We can't help you out until we know that you actually have the samples.
We need proof of life.
I'd be happy to dump one of the containers out of the window.
No, no, no, don't do that, please!
Don't dumb my sperm on us!
Hello, ma'am.
Top of the morning to you.
All right, look, if you let us upstairs We'll give you Abigail.
I'll buzz you in.
And that is how it's done.
Like taking candy from a baby.
Why would you bring up babies right now?
- It's a saying.
- Who would do that?
The question is, why would someone want to talk to Gina?
That's very rude.
It's obvious why the guy wants to talk to a civilian like her; He's stalling.
That's also rude.
Maybe he wants to talk to a normal person instead of two rude cops.
Well, whatever his reason, we have no other choice.
Gina take his statement.
Yes, thank you!
I'm gonna get this guy to admit to crimes he hasn't even committed.
No, that would be a huge problem.
Copy that.
We'll get you a file on him so you can study up.
That won't be necessary.
I'm gonna go with my gut.
He asked for Gina.
Let's give the people what they want.
Steven, Steven, Steven You mind if I take a seat?
Go for it.
Oh, boy.
Look, I'm not a cop.
I don't really like cops.
Honestly, I think crime's kind of cool.
- Okay.
- Yeah, you get it.
Are we still holding out hope that this might work?
I am.
Let's give her a shot.
I feel like you and me are really bonding.
I'm ready to give you immunity.
No, you're not.
That's not happening!
Gina, come out of there.
Negative.
The guy wanted to talk to a real person, not a cop.
That's why he asked for me.
Actually, I asked for you because we went to high school together.
- What?
- Steven Henderson.
We had a bunch of classes together.
Steven Henderson we made out once on the bus.
I mean do you not remember me?
Uh Eleanor.
Jake.
Charles.
Okay, you just said your own name, bud.
It was the only one left.
Okay, so we have given you Abigail.
Now it's time for you to make good on your side of the deal, and I can't believe I'm saying this show us Charles' sperm.
It's my sperm.
It's in the freezer.
I'll be right back.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Abigail was our only bargaining chip.
Don't worry.
I have a plan.
As soon as she comes back in here, I'm gonna grab that cup right out of her hands and run like hell.
You think that'll work?
I don't just think it will.
I know it might.
Here it is cold and sad.
Just like you.
How do I know that that's really Charles'?
I'm gonna have to read the label up close.
If I could just take a look Go, Boyle!
You really think I'm that stupid?
It's called a dummy cup, dummies.
Damn it.
She's right; It's empty.
- Oh - I'm actually kind of relieved.
I did not want to see that.
You two are messing with the wrong woman.
And now you're gonna pay for it.
- Wait, wait!
- Eleanor, Eleanor!
There are two real containers.
One is in a safe location, and this is the other one.
Or rather, it was the other one.
No!
She shot a hostage.
Charles, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, but I don't have a choice, Jake.
I'm gonna go bully an old priest so I can get my sperms back.
He's a priest?
Yeah, I looked him up.
He's a priest, a 90-year-old priest.
But don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt him.
I'm just gonna casually yawn Thereby exposing my gun and badge.
Listen, you can't do this, Charles; It's illegal.
I have to.
You saw what Eleanor did to millions of my babies.
I heard them scream!
That was you.
I am them, and they are me.
You could go to prison, okay?
You're right.
You're right.
What am I thinking?
Thank you for looking out for me - Yeah.
- Friend.
No!
What oh, Charles, what are you doing?
No, no, no, no, no!
Not the keys, no!
Oh, I should've known.
You're a hugger, not a shaker.
It was the most painful thing I've ever done, and I've taken three of my grandparents off life support.
How are you always in charge of that?
Wait, Charles, do not get in that car!
- He's getting in the car.
- Sorry.
Don't you drive away!
He's driving away.
Charles!
I just got an email from SAM-SAM.
Rejected?
I've never been rejected from anything.
Me neither.
Oops, did you say rejected or ejected?
I've been rejected a lot.
I don't understand.
My application was so good.
You know what?
I've also been ejected.
Flume ride, Topeka, Kansas.
How did this happen?
Just forgot to put on the belt.
Jeffords.
Good talk, Ames.
You wrote me a bad recommendation.
How could you?
- Excuse me?
- It's the only explanation!
You're mad that I broke your face and I burned your whole body.
Well, grow up!
Grow up?
I have a Roth IRA!
I eat wheat toast!
You grow up!
You know what?
Here's the letter that I sent.
"Amy Santiago is one of the finest detectives in my precinct nay, the entire NYPD".
Yeah, I even used the word "nay".
The idea that you would question my integrity is so Uh-oh, I got to sneeze.
This is gonna hurt!
Oh, oh, God.
Oh, Hitchcock, thank God!
Handcuffed yourself to a car?
Been there.
What?
No, Charles did this.
Here, quick, hand me those keys.
Here we go.
What will you give me for them?
Seriously?
What do you want?
A dollar for a soda; Mine are all wet.
Yes, obviously, I'll give you that!
Bam!
A soda only costs 75Â¢, you fool.
See you later, sucker!
Didn't even give him the dollar.
I know it seems like I blew it, but you got to give me another crack at him.
Now that I'm aware of our fascinating past, I have all the ammo that I need.
Perhaps you would've had that ammo if you had read the file Diaz offered you.
No doubt.
No doubt.
Gina culpa.
Okay, you get one more chance.
I will not let you down.
Steven, Steven, Steven, I have one question.
Who on the basketball team was into me?
I want names.
What?
We don't have time to play games, Steven.
That's it.
I'm pulling her.
No, no, let her keep going.
Question two Who on the lacrosse team is into me, and which one them aged the best?
A whole lot of woman A whole lot of In 4,000 feet, stay straight.
You interrupted the song for that?
Hello.
Father, I understand you were recently involved in an automobile accident with an Eleanor Horstweil.
Oh, yes, uh, she came up onto the sidewalk and fractured my hip.
You were a pedestrian?
Are you technically a pedestrian if you're sitting on a bench?
Sitting on a bench Well, okay, I don't want to tell you to drop your suit against her, but I sure am getting sleepy.
Excuse me?
Yawns a-coming.
I got you.
Hi there.
I'm Jake.
This is my best friend, Charles.
He's trying to have a baby.
You get it.
Now, come here, you.
Charles, I know you're mad, but you have to talk to me.
It's funny how getting tased in the back can break your heart and also really hurt your back.
I'm sorry.
I really wanted to be a papa, and you ruined it.
You pop-blocked me.
I know, but I couldn't let you break the law.
And I won't let Eleanor turn you into a bad person.
What other choice do I have?
There's always a choice, Charles And by the way, DNA is not the only thing that makes somebody into a father.
I mean, not that it's any of my business, but I have biological father, and he's a nightmare.
He never played catch with me.
He never taught me how to ride a bike.
I had to learn how to shave from watching "Home Alone".
Makes sense; It's like "Die Hard" for kids.
Plus, is this how you really want it to go?
Eleanor controlling your life, ruining your career?
So what do I do?
Honestly, I don't know.
But I do know that you're gonna be a great dad with or without your - Boyle oil.
- Nope, not gonna say it.
But you will.
There's still time left on Eleanor's deadline.
I'm gonna unlock this door.
You do what you got to do.
That seems like a bad sign.
Hey, Santiago, you know why you didn't get into SAM-SAM?
Probably because I used a modern format on my cover letter that put my email above my home address.
Why take such a risk?
No, I sent the recommendation letter to the wrong place.
I thought you were applying to be a mentor, not a mentee.
You thought I wanted to be a SAM, not a SAM?
Are you insane?
Well, you should be a SAM.
No, I should be a SAM.
We got to start saying something other than SAM because we are barreling toward a misunderstanding.
Amy, you are ready to be teaching others.
I made a call; You're going to be a mentor.
Oh, my God Sergeant, I'm so sorry for ever questioning your integrity.
Thank you so much No, no, no, stand back.
Look, I'm still very scared of you.
Good news.
I got Steven to talk.
Diaz, fantastic.
How did you do it?
Did you finally show him the municipal court website and the pulldown menus you can't click on?
No, I found something we bonded over.
She didn't even know who I was.
And we were good friends.
On more than one occasion, she's called me Gina.
That's her own name.
No, she didn't.
We complained about Gina for an hour, and then he opened up gave me the name of the guy he works for.
I have never been so insulted in my entire life.
I'm not gonna work cases for you guys anymore.
We were never going to ask you to.
You just lost your best detective.
Charles, thank God.
What happened?
- I did it.
- Did what?
I'm freaking out over here; You stormed off.
Yeah, because I was inspired by you.
I ran all the way to Eleanor's house to tell her off.
What do you want, Chunk?
To let you know you can keep my sperm.
I don't need it.
I'm in love and I'm going to be a dad, and there's nothing you could do to stop me.
So good-bye forever.
Oh, and one more thing tell Hercules I'll see him at spin class on Sunday.
Now good-bye!
- How do you guys feel?
- Great.
We were looking at possible donors on the way over.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Check out this guy.
I like him; He want to Yale.
Oh, wait, that says "Yeal University".
Swipe him off.
This is fun oh, that's weird.
That guy kind of looks like my dad.
Wait a minute.
That is my dad.
You cannot use his sperm.
You cannot use his sperm.
My son would be your brother!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Morning, everyone.
Morning, sir.
Hey, look.
We're food stain buds.
Who are you wearing?
Porridge?
Um, oatmeal.
Hmm.
Oh, my God.
He didn't even wipe it off.
He's totally given up on life.
It's loneliness.
Ever since Kevin left for his sabbatical in Paris, he hasn't been the same.
I tried to get him out of the house.
I invited him to bar trivia, but he turned me down, not that Trivia Newton John needed the help.
We're nationally ranked.
It's no big deal.
You're right, it's not.
Well, aren't you all just a bunch of big-hearted dum-dums.
You want to make him feel less lonely?
This is how you do it.
- A case file?
- Yeah, dude loves work.
I thought all your cases were closed.
You were bragging about it so much last night, I couldn't hear the end of the neighbors' fight.
It ended in sex.
It always does.
It didn't make me horny.
It's a cold case from my first year as a detective.
Is it active again?
No, but Holt doesn't have to know that.
So you're gonna lie to him?
No, I'm going to make him forget about his sadness through the power of distraction!
He's gone.
Ah, hola, mi capitan.
Why am I speaking Italian, you might ask?
That was Spanish.
Yeah, there are too many languages.
An old case of mine is starting to heat up, and I'd like your old help to help me solve it, seÃ±or?
- Still Spanish.
- Right.
Joey Garibaldi was a mafia lieutenant.
About eight years ago, I was closing in on him when he disappeared.
But now I'm hearing chatter on the street that he's back in town.
Will you help me?
Hmm, sounds interesting.
Count me in.
Yes!
Thank you very much, sir.
Uh, good-a bye-a.
Italian.
Ooh, standardized tests?
I have a great trick.
Fill in all the bubbles with Wite-Out, jams the machine, everyone passes.
These are practice for the lieutenant's exam.
They're kicking my butt.
I can't get better than 70%.
C-minus, the perfect grade you pass, but you're still hot.
Captain Holt gave me his test to help me study.
Look at what the grader wrote on his essay.
"Thank you for writing this.
Reading it made me a better man".
I'll never be as good a leader as Holt.
You need to stop focusing on tests.
There's more to life than scores and book learning, okay?
Look at me, I've had no official dance training.
Yet here I stand a miracle of movement.
Hey, you guys seen Boyle?
Yep, he's in a little ball under his desk.
Oh, no.
Did you watch "Grimm" again last night?
You know it gives you nightmares.
I'm sad.
Jason died this morning.
I'm sorry.
That's terrible.
Is he a friend of yours?
He was my dog.
Oh, okay, so no big deal then.
No, it is to me.
But don't worry, I'll find a way to power through.
Oh, God.
This is how Jason saw the world.
Wait, was this your dog that humped everything?
Yeah, that's how he died.
He was going to town on one of my snow boots, and his little heart just gave out.
- He didn't even finish.
- Gross.
Anyway, we have to work a stream of B&E's on 4th Street.
It's time for you to move on.
It's what Jackson would've wanted.
- Jason!
- Whatever, little buddy.
Captain, thank you for meeting me.
Sorry to make you work on a Saturday.
No, nonsense, I was free.
Kevin is still in Paris.
Is he?
Wow, I totally forgot about that.
Any-hoops, this is all the stuff that we got from Garibaldi's apartment after he disappeared.
Tell me what you see.
This man is in every photograph.
Nick DiTullio.
I actually brought him in eight years ago, but he refused to talk.
Of course, you know the saying, "time shall open up the mouth of every man to the truth of his neighbor".
All right, it's a real saying.
Let's not dwell on it.
The point is, he's definitely gonna tell us where Garibaldi is.
I don't know where Garibaldi is, all right?
It's not like we were close.
I was just his trainer at the gym.
Then why were you always going out to dinner with him?
- Was he doing reps of linguine?
- Noice.
Look, you don't say no to Garibaldi, all right?
That's why I always let him work his chest and his abs and never his legs.
Yeah, the key is balance.
That's why I never work any of it.
Unless you guys are gonna arrest me, I got to go.
There's an emergency at the gym.
Emergency at the gym just when two cops show up at his door.
That seems suspicious.
We should follow him.
Yeah, this case might actually lead somewhere.
Why are you so surprised?
Because every day on this job is a wonder.
Damn right it is.
Medical examiner, jackpot.
The gym is full of bodies.
- No, Department of Health.
- Oh.
There's been an outbreak of the mumps.
Mumps, that's a funny word.
It's actually a very serious and highly contagious infectious disease.
Yeah, but we're fine.
We were only in contact with that guy for a couple of seconds.
Plus, he didn't even lick any of our eyeballs.
I'm afraid you both have the mumps.
Mumps, still a funny word.
Are we gonna die?
So you both have the mumps.
Sorry to say, it's very contagious.
You may not want to be here, detective.
Oh, it's cool.
I keep up to date on all my vaccinations.
I'm immune to stuff you've never even heard of.
But not immune to braggadocio.
Anyhow, over the next several hours, you will more than likely develop fever, aching, fatigue.
Doesn't sound too bad.
Also, tart foods will cause intense jaw pain, so you may want to avoid sour candies.
What?
You may get painful goiter-like swelling in your neck and often extreme testicular discomfort.
- Okay, okay.
- Cool, cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
No doubt.
Due the highly contagious nature of the virus, you will both be quarantined to your houses for the next nine days.
Oh, nine days in isolation.
Sir, I'd be happy to keep you company.
We can watch the ten-part Nicholas Nickleby special on PBS.
Hear there's a lot of long, quiet stretches.
I do love long, quiet stretches, but I don't want to be a burden.
Plus, I'm getting used to being on my own.
Or we could be quarantined together, you know, work the case.
Yes, that actually sounds kind of fun.
Kind of?
It's gonna be the best week ever.
I'm sorry, did you not hear me say extreme testicular discomfort?
Yes, we heard you, Dr. Bad News Doctor.
Okay, so I talked to Captain Holt.
He and Jake have the mumps.
I'm in charge until Holt gets better.
Hello, you wanted to see if you can make a great captain.
Now's your chance to shine.
You're the pretty little understudy.
And the aging lead?
Well, she just fell down the stairs.
Now all's you got to do is beat those wings and fly.
So for the next two weeks, Captain Holt will be on medical leave, which means I am the acting captain.
And we are your royal subjects.
Do continue.
I want this precinct to get our normal work done, but also, we're gonna clean out the evidence room, step up community service, and complete these Every time we check one off the list, you're gonna hear this bell.
It's the sound of victory.
Hmm, you should add "fix bell" to that list.
- Morning, Captain.
- Peralta.
I'd like to introduce you to someone.
His name is Simon, and I hate him.
Hello, Simon.
This is Balthazar.
He's an evil demon who spits fire in my throat.
Goiters, huh?
Anyway.
I've been looking over these photographs of the restaurant, and I've identified several other known mob types.
What is it?
Did you see something?
No, I just got very cold very fast.
And now my entire body is somehow on fire.
Oh, these mumps are jerks.
Whew.
I also noticed this van is parked out front in several other photographs.
I never noticed that.
The restaurant must have been under surveillance.
I bet it was the feds.
You're right.
I'll reach out to my contact at the bureau, see if I can get us some footage.
Good idea.
Also, I know you're not supposed to, but I kind of want to poke my mump.
- Bad idea.
- I'm going in.
Here we go.
It hurts!
How did I not see that coming?
I feel dizzy.
Hey.
You're off the floor.
Yeah.
Well, it's like my dad used to say.
"Real men don't cry for more than three days".
So I decided to get my butt back to work.
Good.
You go through all the witness statements yet?
What?
Oh, no.
By "work," I meant on Jason's in memoriam video.
- Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.
Take a look at what I got so far.
Tell me how am I supposed to live without you Now that I've been loving you so long Hey, we've got a lot to do.
Focus up and stop watching funny dog videos.
Aw.
This might just be the fever talking, but this unedited footage of an Italian restaurant from eight years ago might be the best movie I've ever seen.
Also, how weird are forks?
Forks are very weird.
I've always thought so.
Yeah, yeah.
Did we take too much cold medicine?
Not by a long shot.
Balthazar is a thirsty bitch.
Ah, I'll drink to that.
Wait, look.
Garkabargo!
Sorry, can't can't talk.
Need more medi-jen.
Garibaldi!
He's eating snakes!
No, it's spaghetti.
It's always spaghetti.
I'm just saying, if that's spaghetti, it looks like snakes.
That's right, Nine-Nine.
That's the sound of the victory bell.
We just crossed our first task off the list.
Oh, my goodness.
Terry, that is so great.
Which one was it?
- Fix bell.
- All right.
Little less than I had hoped for, but still a thing.
You gonna hear that sound nonstop.
Unhand her, you beast!
Give it to me!
What the hell is going on in here?
Hitchcock's trying to steal my sandwich.
Well, we both ordered meatball subs, but they only delivered one.
It's mine!
Guys, guys, look, just walk to the sub shop it's a block away and get a second sandwich.
- Walk?
- Are you insane?
Fine, cut the damn sandwich in half.
And then what, genius?
We each eat a 6-inch sub?
Two and a half meatballs a piece?
- Are we children?
- What is this, Russia?
Okay, that's it.
No one eats the sub.
Get back to work!
Wait a minute.
Why'd he just go in the kitchen?
Do we have eyes in the kitchen?
There are eyes everywhere, man.
Ow, ow, achy, achy, ow.
Look, he slipped the chef a piece of paper.
I bet it's the address of his hideout.
The chef knows where the hideout is.
His name is Richie Lignardi.
We talk to him, we find Garibaldi.
We have to go right now.
Go where?
Ah!
What's on your face?
Oh, right, uh, yes, my disgusting deformity.
Here, let me just Hey, what's up, girl?
Better?
It's not worse.
We're on our way right now to talk to a lead that knows where Garibaldi's hideout is.
You're quarantined.
You can't go outside spewing mumps like a couple of mump fountains.
Not like this, we can't!
Everyday I'm hustling E-everyday I'm hustling Everyday I'm hustling E-everyday I'm hustling Everyday I'm hustling Stop, you can't leave at all.
Good luck trying to stop us.
You'll never catch us!
Amy is Usain Bolt.
Is this the piece of paper you're looking for?
You found the address?
No, it's a recipe for baked ziti.
It was taped to your wall the entire time.
You're delirious, and you're sick, and you definitely didn't solve the case.
You need to go back inside.
Well, I can't.
My legs stopped working.
Ah, my testicles.
The mumps have reached my testicles.
All right, just finish taking off your totally ineffective biohazard suits and have a little rest.
Nonsense, Santiago.
We just have to buckle down and work harder.
We simply hit a bump in the road.
More like a mump in the road.
Such a good one.
Jake, can I talk to you in private for a minute?
Sure thing, let me just snag this, cover up the ol' swell sack.
All right.
Okay, so here's the deal.
I have a high fever, and I can't control my body, but you can do whatever you want to me.
Oh, but don't touch my mouth, neck, or testicles.
You've badly misread the situation.
Oh, thank God.
Jake, you need to drop this case.
What are you talking about?
The plan is working perfectly.
Holt hasn't been lonely all week.
Yeah, because he's too busy almost dying.
- Look at him.
- What?
He's just "Beautiful Mind"-ing it.
Because he's a genius.
He's writing the word "case" over and over again.
Oh, now he's spelling it with a K. Is that not how you spell it?
Again, I have a mouth, neck, and testicle-melting fever.
- Jake.
- Hmm?
Enough is enough.
You need to drop this stupid backburner cold case before you both die or I will kill you.
Oh, my God, I thought I was following her.
Yep, I should probably lie down.
Here we go.
Case!
What are you doing?
Just sealing Jason's collar in an airtight bag so it retains his scent.
I don't know how many whiffs I have left.
Wow.
Look, I know that dog meant a lot to you, so I got you this.
It's a dog.
His name's Arlo, but you can call him Jason Two or whatever.
Seriously?
I can't just replace Jason with some other dog.
Why not?
All dogs are basically the same.
Watch this.
Arlo, go hump that toy.
Get away from that.
That's Jason's.
Look, man, I've been patient.
We have a case we need to work on.
It's time for you to get over it, move on.
Move on?
Move on.
Jason was part of my family, Rosa.
I loved him.
His humping was the only thing that got me through my divorce.
Seeing him so happy made me believe that I could be happy one day too.
You wouldn't understand this because you have a motorcycle helmet for a heart, but I need to feel this sadness.
So the only thing that I'm moving on from is you.
So I, like, have a dog now?
Hey, what's going on with those files?
Oh, we're not working on them.
- We're on strike.
- Hunger strike.
- You're eating potato chips.
- Chips don't count.
My doctor said they have zero nutritional value.
We want meatball subs.
You had no right to take ours.
Screw this.
I'll log those files and teach the Hazmat class, and I'll do everyone's work, because apparently, I am the only one keeping this precinct together!
Um, I think you closed the door too hard.
Hey, I found popsicles.
These should help cool us down.
"Thanks, Jake".
You're welcome, nards.
Peralta, Balthazar has a sister.
Meet Penelope.
Guh-hoo, yeah, mumps on mumps.
Let's not dwell on it.
We should get back to work.
Or we could fall asleep for five to seven days and see how we feel.
I will not rest till justice is served.
There's no time to waste.
This case is urgent.
Oh, boy.
All right, listen.
The case may not be quite as urgent as once thought.
Um I dug it up out of my desk so you'd have something to do on weekends because you seemed so lonely.
You cited chatter from the streets that Garibaldi had resurfaced.
I did.
I did.
I did.
But said chatter may have been fudged.
So you lied to me?
Out of pity.
You pity me.
I wouldn't put it that way.
I would.
I am offended.
I am angry.
I am very tired.
So I'm gonna take a nap, but when I wake up, oh, you are in for it.
How dare you?
How dare me?
How dare you?
I was just trying to help.
Wow, your help feels an awful lot like pity, so do me a favor and don't ever help me again.
Wow, well, you didn't seem to mind me helping you when I got you your job back at the Nine-Nine.
I didn't ask you to do that.
You said we were out of peas, you pea hog!
- You're the pea hog!
- You're the pea hog!
- No, you!
- You take that back!
You!
Double poke!
Okay, hope you guys are hungry.
Made baked ziti.
Thought it would be fun to use Garibaldi's ultra authentic recipe.
Oh, great, pity food.
Thank you anyway, but I can cook for myself.
Wow, I would roll my eyes so hard right now if it didn't make my brain burn.
Okay, Captain, this ends now.
I know your pride is hurt, but no one ever took pity on you.
All we wanted to do was help you when you were down because that's what people do when they care about each other.
They tell each other lies and invent urgent mysteries that need to be solved?
Come up with excuses to spend time together like trivia nights or folk art festivals.
Or working old-ass cases with their mumpy boy, Jake.
Back to you, Amy.
We're doing great.
You're gonna eat this ziti, and you're gonna appreciate it, and you're gonna grow the hell up.
Okay, you're right.
I'm sorry for the way I acted.
I can't wait to eat your food.
Ugh, this is revolting.
Wow, have you learned nothing?
Oh, God!
That is worse than the mumps, Amy.
What the hell?
I used Garibaldi's exact recipe.
I know I'm not a great cook, but I love following instructions.
Seven cups of salt?
Even I know this isn't a recipe.
Which means it might be a code.
Ooh, interesting.
Ten digits, maybe it's a phone number.
Look, 718, Brooklyn area code.
Yes, that's definitely it.
Wait, did you actually use all of this salt and 18 cups of oregano?
Back off, I solved the case.
Nine onions?
Oh, Amy.
How am I the bad guy here?
All right, all right, looks good.
I can barely tell you hulked out in here.
Yeah, but two weeks in charge, and I didn't get any of my goals accomplished.
You got Hitchcock and Scully off their hunger strike.
I just threw a bunch of popcorn on the floor.
It wasn't that hard.
Yeah, they're animals.
Do you want to know why the amazing Captain Holt has never gotten the evidence room cleaned or done anything on your list?
Why?
Because all day long, he's putting out fires.
That's what a captain does.
The only difference between you and Holt is that he lacks the strength to close a door so hard a room blows up.
Thanks, Gina.
Ah, you don't have to thank me.
All I did was be the only person who believes in you.
Don't lean against the door.
Terry caused structural damage.
My God, you're strong.
Briefing room, now.
I really don't feel like having you yell at me anymore.
What is this?
It's a funeral for Jason.
I want to say a few words.
When Jason died seven days ago, I didn't give a rat's ass.
This is your speech?
'Cause I didn't understand why people care so much about their dumb dogs till I got a dumb dog myself.
I've only had Arlo for a day and a half, but if anything happened to him, I would kill everyone in this room and then myself.
Very violent eulogy, I like it.
Charles, I'm sorry.
You don't have to get over it.
Take as long as you want.
Scully, it's time.
Ave Maria Okay, thank you.
Good news, Garibaldi's phone number's still active, so they were able to locate him.
SWAT just picked him up, so that's that.
Yeah, that's that.
Perfect timing as our quarantine has finally ended and our goiters are gone.
Yes, indeed.
We're free to go outside and lick whoever's eyeballs we'd like.
Inaccurate, no one is ever free to do that.
Yeah, you're right.
Anyhow, I am out.
Wait a minute.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
I was too proud to admit I was lonely.
So thank you.
You're welcome.
Ain't no thang.
No, it is a thang, and an even bigger thang is that you brought me back to the Nine-Nine, and I will always be grateful for that.
So Here.
This is for you.
Oh, sour candies.
I missed you so much!
Oh!
It burns!
Thank you for this candies!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Okey dokey.
The car is picking me and Amy up in two minutes.
You sure you're cool keeping tabs on my cases while I'm on the cruise?
You bet.
I hope you have a great time.
Hey, don't make any new best friends.
Oh.
Maybe you shouldn't go.
Are you kidding?
I am psyched to go on this week-long cruise, just sitting around doing nothing.
Straight up living that slug life, y'all.
Cruise itineraries, hot out of the laminator.
Who's ready for some nonstop totally scheduled fun?
Oh, I actually thought we could just sit by the pool, eat unlimited shrimp, and see what it does to our bodies.
That's cute.
I don't know if there's gonna be time, though.
The cruise offers 77 activities, and I signed us up for 76 of them.
Speed dating for widows seemed like a bummer.
Okay, so slightly different perspectives going into this cruise.
Call it the slug life talking, but I think it's gonna work itself out.
Good-bye, coworkers, or as they like to say at sea - This is so great.
- Yeah.
Seagulls, check.
The ocean, check.
A gang of oldies in short shorts, check, check, check.
We are definitely on a cruise.
Welcome aboard.
Say, "I love Carousel Cruises International Ltd." I love Carousel Cruises International Ltd. I don't want to say that.
All right.
So the Sail Away party is in an hour, and until then, I have us scheduled to take in live music at the all-ages piano lounge.
Okay, okay.
Or we could just head straight to the room.
I brought a plastic tarp so we can eat shrimp in bed.
But the all-ages piano lounge has bottomless margaritas.
Eh.
They also have a drink with a potato skin in it.
Ohh.
To the all-ages piano lounge, merlady.
Mm-hmm.
Welcome aboard, ladies and gentlemen, but especially ladies.
I know that voice.
Get ready.
It's time for some smush songs.
Doug Judy.
The Pontiac Bandit.
He's here.
We got songs about smushing, songs for smushing to, songs for the kids.
This is the all-ages piano lounge.
I can't believe he's here.
I've been hunting him for years, and now fate has dropped him right into my lap.
He's gonna be so surprised when he sees me.
Hey, Peralta, you made it.
What took you so long, brother?
Okay, seems like he's playing it pretty cool.
Probably more surprised on the inside.
Uh-huh.
Sir, Gina and I are worried about you.
You're drinking a second can of seltzer.
I need this to settle my nerves.
Hurricane Debbie is approaching.
My little sister Debbie, she's a real drama queen.
The drama queen of the Holt family?
What, did she laugh out loud one time?
She's laughed out loud multiple times.
Sir, you have a pretty low bar for what you consider drama.
Once, I used an exclamation point in a email.
You called me Diana Ross.
I assure you, in this case, I do not exaggerate.
Raymond!
Here.
Judge for yourselves.
Here you are.
Great.
Oh, my God.
My trip here from the train station hey, I swear to you I heard the cab driver mumble under his breath, "You will die tonight".
Is that not the most insane thing you have ever heard?
I mean, can you even, Raymond?
I cannot even.
I hadn't seen her in a while.
She lived alone.
She was 89 years old.
Okay, thanks.
There's no forced entry or visible trauma.
It's probably natural causes.
- We'll take a look around - Sure.
This huge apartment.
What is this, like, Exposed brick.
Got tons of natural light.
Weird.
I thought you'd be most exciting about the gas range.
They have a gas range.
I have to apply for this apartment.
I mean, it just became available.
We're the only two people to see it.
This is an opportunity you just don't get in New York real estate ever.
A woman just died here.
Don't be gross and disrespectful.
Holy crap, look at all this closet space.
I'm applying too.
What?
You don't need closet space.
You have, like, one outfit.
- Just let me have this.
- No.
We saw it at the same time.
May the best man win.
Game on.
I mean, the game of contacting the next of kin.
That's the game I like to play.
Peralta, it's no coincidence you're on a ship.
You won a free cruise without entering a contest.
How do you think that happened?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because I bought "Speed 2" on DVD, and the Internet realized that cruises were one of my interests.
Great film.
Sandy B. in a sarong.
Damn straight.
But the tix are all me.
I brought you here 'cause I'm in peril.
- Pfft.
Peril.
- Don't "pfft" my peril.
Pfft.
Somebody's trying to kill me, and I need protection, so I sent for my best friend.
I am not your best friend.
I'm your worst enemy.
Get that through your head.
It's this kind of bickering that makes us such an adorable couple.
Whatever, Judy.
You're under arrest.
You can't arrest me, boo.
We're in international waters, which is also why I can smoke as much weed as I want.
Welcome to the high seas.
No, no way that that's true.
Amy, tell me I can arrest him right now.
Judy's right.
We have no jurisdiction.
Technically this boat flies under the flag of Uzbekistan.
Uh-oh.
Your girl knows about the Uzbeks.
Oh.
But the captain can have him arrested.
He has total authority on this boat.
Perfect.
Captains love me.
Just wait until he or she finds out they're employing a criminal.
Yeah, about 40% of the crew are criminals.
It's hard to find normal people who want to live on a boat.
I, myself, am a tax evader.
I just need him locked up till we get back to New York.
Can't you just throw him in boat jail?
It's called the brig.
He is my best lounge singer, and I need to keep people distracted.
Just between us, we're nearly out of ranch dressing.
On day one?
These people are animals.
Listen, as long as he's on my boat, Doug Judy is a free man.
Jake, Amy, welcome to my cabin, AKA the Boom-Boom Stateroom.
This is a royale level suite.
I never thought we'd see one in person.
Little perk of being Carousel Cruises' entertainer of the year.
Which I am, girrr-rl A little pitch-y.
You're welcome to chill here.
It's the least I can do to thank you for protecting me.
Never.
This protection scam is a scam.
Do you honestly think you can fool me again just because you've successfully done it numerous times before?
Look, my old boss wants me dead.
I've been laying low on this ship, and I got word from a friend on the inside that they found me, and there's a hitman coming to end my beautiful life.
That's why I sent you the free tickets.
No!
No, no way.
I'm not buying it.
You can't get away from me again.
Amy and I are gonna spend every second of our romantic cruise watching you, assuming that's okay?
Yep.
That's what we're gonna do.
Yeah.
I'll just get rid of this itinerary.
No, no, no, no, Ames, don't put that down.
We have to find the hitman before he finds me.
I'm guessing this'll take us all over the boat.
Oh, yeah, that's an ENAC sitch right there.
"Every Nook And Cranny".
Perfect.
We'll just ENAC sitch, uh, of this bitch.
How's it going with your sister, sir?
Well, last night, she told me in a great detail about a fight she got into with her trainer, whom she accused of stealing a hairbrush.
Now she's on the phone, screaming at our mother.
We'll keep her out of your hair.
I'm good at distracting people.
It's what I do with my toddlers all day long.
How does she feel about balloon animals?
I'm sure she has a complicated relationship with them.
- Ray!
- Here she comes.
No balloon animals.
You ain't gonna believe Mom's take on this.
She thinks I'm the one who should apologize just 'cause it turns out the hairbrush ended up being in my car.
Yes, I'd love to discuss your hairbrush for even more time, but I have some pressing police matters to attend to.
Look at you.
Always working.
What happened to my fun big brother?
Fun?
I was never fun.
You take that back.
I'm sure she didn't mean anything by it, sir.
When we were little, we would go down in the basement, and he would build us a fort.
We would stay down there all day.
And Ray would sing these silly little made-up songs.
George and Ira Gershwin did not compose silly, made-up songs.
Uh, Debbie, let me show you New York, okay?
The buildings, the subway, the bank, the dry cleaner I got to run some errands.
Oh, that's a great idea, Gina.
Debbie, I'm so sorry I won't get a chance to see you much on your visit.
Uh, no thing but a chicken wing, 'cause I'm gonna be here for six weeks.
I'ma be all up in your life, okay?
I got five down.
I figured out the theme.
It's boats.
Okay, I get it.
She's smart and lovable; you're scrappy and lovable; together you're just lovable and lovable.
Okay, so where's this hitman, Judy?
Look, I don't know who they sent, but he's on the boat.
Check out this manifest.
Somebody boarded in San Juan named Henry Coles.
Henry Street and Coles Street, that's the corner of your old chop shop in Brooklyn.
- This is an alias.
- Mm-hmm.
And my porter buddy checked out Henry Coles' cabin, He hasn't been in it yet.
He's hiding somewhere on this boat ready to jump out and kill me at any moment.
Probably creepin' around in my closet.
- Or stowed away in a lifeboat.
- Or hiding in a wall.
Or holed up in the engine room.
Camouflaged in the shrubbery.
Predator style.
No.
We are not having fun.
You will not suck me in with your wily charms.
SeÃ±or Gotaro, un cafÃ© con leche, sin azÃºcar.
Gracias.
Hola, Mr. Gotaro.
Good to see you.
Can I talk to Rosa for a quick sec about some super serious police work?
I know what you're trying to do.
You brought him in here to butter him up.
Yeah, and I've been laying it on real thick.
Mint?
Okay, but you're making a big mistake.
Nobody sucks up like a Boyle.
Of course, you knew that already because you're so smart.
I just did it to you.
Fine, little man.
- Bring it.
- Okay.
Looks like you and I are in a good, old-fashioned suck-off.
Don't call it a suck-off.
Why not?
Why shouldn't Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Totally, yep.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
Smart.
Good.
You brought your own shuffleboard stick?
- Mm-hmm.
- They're called tangs.
You should be glad she has her own.
You don't want her messing with another man's tang.
There is no way they're called tangs.
It's true.
They are.
And the disks are called biscuits.
- Yes.
- Tangs and biscuits?
That is so dumb.
I officially love shuffleboard.
Clear a path!
I'm about to whip my biscuit!
Yah!
Whoo.
About time you smiled, Jake.
You've been a real tang in the mud.
- All right.
- Hey, little advice.
Amy is great.
You want to keep her, be more receptive to her interests.
All right, now you're taking it too far, Judy.
I don't need relationship advice from my criminal archnemesis.
Look, I just want to see you two happy.
No.
This is just another one of your lies, just like your fake hitman.
There is a hitman on this boat.
Henry Coles is coming to kill me.
Excuse me?
- What?
- You said my name.
I'm Henry Coles.
You're Henry Coles?
According to my medical alert bracelet.
Well, this is interesting.
This is Henry Coles.
Let's just take a look at that.
Oh, it says, "Doug Judy is a liar".
Actually, it says I'm a fall risk.
Okay, you're kind of ruining my burn here, Henry.
I knew it.
I knew Henry Coles was a 90-year old man with type 1 diabetes and emphysema.
Obviously, I didn't know those specifics, but I knew you were lying.
So Henry Coles wasn't the guy.
My bad.
There's still somebody on this boat who wants to kill me.
You're trying to get away, and it's not gonna happen.
We're spending the rest of this trip in your cabin.
Amy and I will take sleep shifts to make sure someone's always watching you.
Thank you.
That makes me feel super safe.
And if you want to smush, I have a sleep mask and noise canceling headphones.
Can't we just lock him up in there?
Do we really have to trade off sleep for the next six nights?
I know.
I'm sorry.
But he did say that he'd wear a mask if we want to smush.
Fine.
I get it.
He's the Pontiac Bandit.
You take the first shift.
Thank you so much.
You're the best.
Hey, NYPD!
Let him go!
Now do you believe me?
That guy was trying to kill me.
All right, fine!
Someone wants you dead!
You win.
Smush, smush Ooh, I still sound like an angel.
You sure?
Thank God you were there, Peralta.
I knew you wouldn't let your best friend die.
I'm still gonna arrest you.
I just can't do that if you're dead.
Whatever you gotta tell yourself.
Baby steps.
It's hard getting him out of his shell Tell me about it.
Every time we get emotional, he's like, "Noice, smort".
Okay, can we focus up here?
We still don't know what your hitman looks like, so we're gonna have to flush him out.
Wait a minute.
Where do the toilets on this boat go?
You don't want to know.
The pool?
- Ocean.
- Oh, that's even worse.
That's where my shrimp live.
Anyways, he'll probably try to hit me at my show this afternoon.
At least I'll die doing what I love: getting people horny at sea.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's gross.
All right, here's the plan.
We're gonna leave you alone on stage and dangle you as bait.
Damn!
Bait dangling?
If we're up on stage with you, it could spook him.
We'll blend into the crowd, and we'll take him down before he even gets to you.
All right, I'll trust you.
But if you're gonna blend in, you got to blend in.
If you like piÃ±a coladas And getting caught in the rain You two are looking good.
Really?
I kind of feel like I'm Jimmy Buffett's tennis coach.
No, it's working.
You know I had a major crush on Magnum P.I.?
Major.
Oh, should I grow a moustache?
Yeah, you should.
Actually, I can't.
I'm physically incapable.
I shouldn't have suggested that.
Should we go in?
You found me.
Drinking seltzer in the shadows.
I still can't believe Debbie's gonna be staying with me for six weeks.
Sir, when your neighbor is playing their terrible music too loud, do you ask them to be quiet?
Hell no.
You blast your garbage, and you drown 'em out.
You got to fight drama with drama.
Debbie, it's just too much.
- What happened?
- Wait till you hear.
Kevin is all, "Hey, man, I'm leaving for Paris," And I said, "Then go already.
I don't care," but I do care, and now I'm like, "Where's Kevin"?
Well, I didn't know y'all had all of that going on.
Ugh, no one understands me.
And now you're here, and I love you, but, like, it's a lot.
Everything in my life is a hot mess right now.
Damn.
Captain, the commissioner called again.
He wants to know when crime will be down.
Are you kidding me?
What am I supposed to tell him?
I'm under so much pressure.
I just can't even.
You got a lot on you.
And I don't want to overstay my welcome if that's gonna stress you out.
It will, especially with Mercury in retrograde.
I am sorry.
I-I didn't know.
I mean, the only reason I came is 'cause Gary left me.
What?
He was cheating on me.
But you know what?
No.
No, no, no.
I'm not gonna burden you with that, okay?
I will deal with that myself.
There's been a jailbreak, and the Mafia's at it again.
Hey, what's going on here?
I didn't realize we had more questions to ask Mr. Gotaro together.
Oh, we don't.
I asked Mr. Gotaro all of them.
Wait.
Hold on.
"Gotaro".
Isn't that a Andalusian name?
- Yeah.
- What a weird coincidence.
Pardon me, Detective Diaz.
Last night, I cooked up a ton of Andalusian baby eels.
Unbelievable.
I love angula.
I mean, it's impossible to find here.
Oh, not if you have a ton of disposable income and great credit, like I do.
I think you're gonna love these.
I really buttered them up.
Wow, thank you so much.
Uh, before I leave, um, I should tell you, you're both great applicants, but I've decided to rent the apartment to someone else.
I smiled at you.
For what?
Ladies and gentlemen, widows and widowers, welcome to the all-ages piano lounge adults only show.
I'm Horatio Velveteen.
- Dope name.
- Mm.
This is a little song I wrote myself, called "Rosa, Rosa, Rosa".
Goes like this.
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa Rosa, Rosa It's so crowded in here, and the lighting is way too sexy to see anything.
- Come on.
- Okay.
Right there on the floor Is the man you're looking for He's right in front of you A little bit to the left My left, my left, my left, my left Come on this way He's in a red shirt No, not the Asian dude I'm talking about a bright red shirt That's the man you're looking for That's the man you've been looking for I got him.
Follow me.
Ah, come on.
This is still a love song Where'd he go?
Well, that ends my show, all of a sudden.
You've been a great crowd.
Thank you very much.
He's taking me where you smushed.
Jake, help me.
I don't want to die.
I'm still on second season of "Game of Thrones".
All right, just put the knife down, okay?
There's no murder in the all-ages piano lounge.
Screw you, pig.
That is not a very all-ages thing to say.
You just don't get the vibe here at all.
Whoo!
Nice, grab that cord.
Let's get his arms.
Come here.
You just got tanged by my girlfriend.
Sorry, I know that sounded really gross, but it was actually awesome.
You okay, Judy?
Judy!
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
Bye, Peralta.
Thanks for saving my life.
No.
Judy!
Don't do this!
No, not again!
Judy!
Judy!
Where is Judy?
I've looked everywhere.
He has to be somewhere on this boat.
Peralta!
No, he doesn't.
Sorry to do this to you, man.
I saw an opening, and I had to take it.
I can't go to jail.
I'm too cool.
You'll never get away from me, Judy!
I can't hear what you're saying.
You're real far away.
I'll just assume you're finally admitting we're best friends.
No, that is not what I'm saying!
Thank you.
It means a lot to me.
Enjoy the rest of your cruise.
Just remember, you got a fine lady.
Don't be a tang in the mud.
Check your pockets!
Boom-Boom Stateroom, baby!
Awesome.
But this isn't over!
I will hunt you to the ends of the Earth!
I love you too!
I'm so proud of us for being able to say it.
What are you still standing there for?
- Go smush!
- Judy!
No!
Well, okay, but my train is in 45 minutes.
I don't have to say good-bye to Ray.
I don't want to stress him out.
No, he specifically asked us to get you.
Hello, Debbie.
You made a fort?
I thought we could talk under here about you and Gary.
Well I'm sorry I was pushing you away.
I want you to know that I'm here for you, and I would love to be all up in your life.
Aw, you - Give me a hug.
- Okay.
All right.
Mr. Gotaro.
You're under arrest for the murder of your tenant Shirley Crouch.
What are you talking about?
Is this because I didn't rent to you?
No.
But that was suspicious.
Why wouldn't you want cops with great credit living in your building?
Great credit and an eel hookup.
Because you murdered her.
Toxicology report says the old lady was poisoned.
Her apartment was rent controlled, and you couldn't jack up the price until she was out of there.
I just have one last question.
If you go to jail, who makes the rental decisions in the building?
It'll pass to a trust.
The bank controls it.
Game back on?
If you have to ask, you're already one step behind.
I should help bring him back in.
- We're still police officers.
- Yeah.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Mm-hmm.
If the toilets drain into the ocean, does that mean a tiny shark could swim up and bite me in the butt?
No, not at all.
- Psh, lame.
- Look.
I know you're bummed about the Pontiac Bandit so if it's any consolation, we could spend the rest of the cruise eating shrimp in bed.
That is incredibly sweet, but no way.
We have too many activities to do.
Eh?
You'll never guess what starts in three minutes.
- Salsa dancing.
- Oh, so you can guess.
Thank you for doing this.
I love you.
Noice.
Smort.
I love you too.
Also, I think this is definitely a dance class for widows.
- No, I don't think so.
- No?
Now turn to your partner and tell them how your spouse died.
Yeah, we should get out of here.
- Are you sure?
Okay.
- Yes.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Gather around, glorious turd monsters, and feast your eyes on what I hold in this hand: the future of movement a hoverboard.
I don't understand those things.
Is walking really so hard for you?
Oh, Ames, walking's a nightmare.
Yeah, Amy.
Now, friends, eat my space dust.
Okay, a little harder to control than I thought.
Okay, there we go.
Whoo!
Think I'm getting the hang of it.
No, I'm not!
I'm all right.
No!
Ow!
I'm doing it!
I'm doing it!
You got this?
No, I do not got this, Terry!
Don't let go of me!
The future of movement is now!
Whoa!
There he is.
All hail the birthday boy.
Oh, what the hell was that?
Charles, probably shouldn't have done that in a police station.
And not celebrate your birthday properly?
I'd rather get shot.
You do you, Boyle.
I'm doing me.
What's this case?
Oh, this isn't work.
It's research on your mom since we're finally meeting.
It's very thorough.
Just relax.
She's gonna love you.
You're both strong, accomplished women that have seen me naked.
I used to be so good at meeting grownups.
I'd just sing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" flawlessly and ride that wave till bath time.
But now it's anybody's guess.
All right, what I am about to say will make you very horny, but you have to try and remember that we're still at work.
Do you want me to quiz you?
Oh, God, yes.
Wow.
Okay, great.
What is my mother's favorite drink?
Red wine over ice.
Just like Diane Keaton, or so she always says.
Favorite topics of conversation?
Jimmy Carter was underrated, how beautiful some front doors are.
What's Jane Seymour up to?
And how cool is it that the ladies across the street are lesbians?
Great.
Nice work.
Topics to avoid: how my dad left us and ruined our lives, how my dad got remarried twice and ruined our lives, how my dad moved to Canada - and ruined our lives.
- You know what?
I'm just gonna steer clear of your dad entirely.
Smart.
You're gonna be fine, all right?
She's gonna totally love you.
Are those her dental records?
Gina, are you excited for our "Escape the Room" team-building exercise?
I told you, sir, it would be far more effective for the squad to go to Vegas, and you give us each $5,000.
No, I see no value in that.
But nine coworkers forced to riddle their way free from a locked room I would spend my $5,000 to buy backstage passes to Britney, and then I'd ask her one question: You think you're a better dancer than me?
We are not going to Las Vegas.
We're going to Long Island City and we will bond meaningfully, and that is a direct order.
I'll see you at 8:00 tonight.
Tonight?
Um Okay, great.
Jake!
Jakester!
Remember when I did not email you about Captain Holt's "Escape the Room" thing tonight?
No, and I can't go.
Amy and I are going to my mom's house for my birthday.
Adults don't care about their birthdays.
You came to work last year on a horse.
Man, forget you.
Where's Charles?
On a stakeout with Rosa and Terry.
Police work?
What a waste of time.
So no Jake, no Amy, no Charles, no Rosa, no Terry.
That leaves me with Aah.
Ooh!
- Aah.
- Aah.
Oh, dear God.
Okay, this is the block our boy Tommy Tran does his drops.
Before we do anything else, are your body cams turned on?
Why are you so obsessed with these things?
It's like your stupid babies all over again.
My babies are not stupid.
Cagney can write a lowercase L. It's just a line, right?
Look, I worked hard to get us included in that pilot program.
Body cams are important, and I need these field tests to go well.
I'm gonna go take my position.
"Just a straight line".
Come on!
Unique New York.
Unique New York.
Unique New York.
I took a Toastmasters class to prepare for tonight.
Seriously, it's gonna be fine.
We're just gonna have some dinner, eat dessert, play charades, and then talk for half an hour about which of her friends are sick.
We're gonna play charades?
You wait until t-minus two seconds to tell me that?
Okay.
Movie.
Book.
What's the thing for song?
I don't know the thing for song.
Hi, birthday boy.
Hi.
Mom, is something on fire?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
You must be Amy.
Let me take you in.
Okay.
I'll just take in this gorgeous front door of yours.
- Mom, seriously, the fire?
- It's fine.
Things don't burn down like they used to.
I'm just gonna put it out.
Well, you know, it's good enough for Diane Keaton.
It's good enough for me.
I love her.
I mean, she's no Jane Seymour.
Where is Jane Seymour now, anyway?
She makes jewelry, and it's beautiful.
I just bought two brooches for the lesbians across the street.
Mom, I keep telling you, if you don't rein it in a little bit, you're gonna scare them off.
Well, that's what you said about Carla, and I ignored it, and now I have a friend with one arm.
I stand corrected.
Oh, must be your birthday surprise.
You got the '86 Mets?
Be warned, a lot of them turned out to be drug addicts, so this could be a bummer.
You ready?
Hey, buddy.
Happy birthday.
Dad?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to surprise you.
Yeah, well I am surprised that you know it's my birthday.
Actually, Jake your father and I are, uh, seeing each other again.
Oh!
Wow, that's that's so interesting.
Oh I know this isn't the best time, but we are in your childhood bedroom, and I do have one question: did you have a nose ring in high school?
Yes.
Until it got infected and I almost went blind.
Don't tell anyone.
Cool.
It's our secret.
Just gonna check my email up high.
No new messages.
Amy, can we focus?
What is going on here?
Why is my dad dating my mom?
What does he want?
Money, but she's a public school art teacher.
That doesn't make any sense.
Maybe that son of a bitch wants his picture drawn!
Jake, Karen is a grown woman with a pretty respectable credit score.
I'm sure she knows what she's doing.
Amy, I know that you have a binder, but you don't know her like I do.
She's too trusting for her own good.
She's fallen for more Nigerian scams than Scully.
She's fallen for 20 Nigerian scams?
That's insane.
No, she's fallen for 2.
Scully's fallen for 20?
Yeah.
Look, all right, you know what?
This is fine.
It's just the same that it's always been.
I have to protect her.
I'm gonna go down there, and I'm going to express my concerns to her in a calm, rational manner.
What are you doing, Mom?
He's evil!
I'm glad we got these sweet cams.
What is happening with your voice?
This is Body Cam Charles.
I got to sound badass in case anybody watches the footage, capisce?
Aah!
Oh, I just spilled soup on the cam!
Why do you have soup on a stakeout?
Oh, no.
Crap!
Oh, it's not turning back on.
Do you think Sarge is gonna be mad that I spilled "fuh" on the cam?
He definitely will if you say pho like that when you tell him.
I'm not gonna mispronounce it.
Not while you're rolling.
Go get yourself cleaned up!
- See anything, Sarge?
- Not yet.
Don't know why I didn't go undercover as someone wearing a scarf.
Terry hates windchill.
Wait, here's our guy.
Got him.
Crap!
I think he made me.
He's headed toward the restaurant!
You follow.
I'll cover the back alley!
Someone's in here!
Uhh!
Ah!
- Rosa?
- Charles.
You're completely naked.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.
Where is everyone, Gina?
Perhaps that's tonight's first puzzle.
I forgot to send the invitations.
But I was able to rally the best and brightest of those available.
Oh, dear God.
Sorry we're late.
Turns out the front door was a push, not a pull.
Well, maybe we should just reschedule.
You have three hours to find the four keys that will prevent the apocalypse and release you from this room.
Your time starts now.
Well, this is a sobering reality.
Okay, I got your favorite cake: - blue.
- I'm not hungry.
It's a figure of speech.
Obviously, I'll have some.
You know, I don't think our guest Amy really wants to talk about this, Jake.
Can we just move on?
Yes.
Maybe we could talk about someone we all admire: President Jimmy Carter.
When I think of the great So how serious is it, Hmm?
Have you guys kissed?
Has he stayed the night?
Has he brought you a chocolate orange from the airport?
'Cause that's his big move.
Jake, your mother and I have been seeing each other for three months.
Oh, you know what?
I oughta throw up in your face.
I know that you're angry, but when I was here last year, you really showed me what a selfish jerk I was.
You're the reason that all of this is happening.
Yeah, but I didn't want this.
I just wanted you to text me Mb dad joke every six months.
I can do that.
Just give me your number.
You didn't save my number?
Now, Jake, look.
I know every mistake your father has made, and he says they're all in the past.
Now just blow out your candles.
Okay, great.
Great idea, Mom.
I'll blow out my birthday candles.
I wished that you would leave.
Damn it, I shouldn't have said it out loud.
Now it won't come true.
Okay, we have maps, a pantry, beds, a desk.
Where should we begin?
Do you have any experience with puzzles?
Yes.
I've never solved one.
This says we have three questions.
- No.
- Uh-oh.
- How do we get outta here?
- Can't tell you.
- Really?
- Yes.
That's enough!
Sorry about that.
Can we please have our questions back?
No.
And that's three.
You're done.
Oh, Captain, how could you?
Hey.
You didn't come back down.
I had to talk to your parents for, like, an hour, and I ran out of stuff from the binder, and then I did something really weird.
The itsy-bitsy spider went up the water spout Down came So do you know where the nearest train station is?
I know it sucks that I did that, but think about how I feel.
My stupid parents are borking each other.
And my mom thinks she knows all the worst things that my dad did, but she has no idea.
She doesn't even know that he cheated on her with her best friend, Sheila Bodden.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I saw them.
They were in our car in the garage having sex.
It's the whole reason I can't have sex in cars in garages.
That's a very specific sexual hang-up.
I mean, has it really held you back?
Well, are we having sex in car in a garage right now?
No.
So, yeah, big time it's held me back.
I never told her about it 'cause I didn't want to crush her heart, but now I have to use it.
I'm gonna tell my dad if he doesn't do the decent thing and leave my mom again I'm dropping the Sheila bomb.
Whoa.
I know this is a really big deal, but I have to ask.
Did you wear this hat in high school?
Amy!
There's only one way I'm gonna get my dad alone.
You have to tell my mom that you need to - speak with her in private.
- About what?
I barely know her.
Tell her you're plugged up and you need a laxative.
What?
No!
What?
I'm not gonna say that.
Okay, here's the plan: I drop the bomb during charades.
I'll just tell him I know about Sheila with my body.
Um Fast, uh, fast "Fast and Furious"?
"Magic Mike"?
I don't know Uh, "Crying Game"?
- I don't know.
- Time.
Ah!
Oh.
- I I didn't - No, no, no.
It's fine.
I it's I'm Um, right, why would you be?
Yeah, it's not like I'm always, uh Naked.
Yeah.
Look, man, no one's ever gonna see that footage.
The case was cut and dry.
It's not like I'm dying to tell anyone I saw your Bennie and the Jets.
Sure.
Whatever.
Hey, I've been looking for you guys.
I just talked to our perp's attorney.
He's claiming the drugs you seized in the bathroom - weren't his.
- What?
But we saw him throw them in the garbage.
Yeah.
Normally, it'd be your word against his, but lucky for us, you were wearing body cams!
Yeah, but the thing about cameras is that they don't really tell the full objective truth.
Images can be distorted.
People often seem naked.
Boyle, what are you talking about?
Boyle is fully nude in the footage.
Why?
The whole thing?
No, no, no.
Not the whole thing.
Okay.
It doesn't matter how much humping I do.
He's still not getting it.
Okay.
Well then this is happening.
Hey, Karen, can I talk to you for a second in private?
I'm a little plugged up.
Oh, well, say no more.
I have an entire cabinet devoted just to that.
Wow.
TMI, you guys.
Thank you.
Oh, man, this is so much fun.
Thanks for giving me a second chance, buddy.
Second chance?
Are you seriously not getting what I'm charades-ing down at you?
That was you and Sheila Bodden humping it up in the back of our car.
What?
I Yeah, that's right.
I saw you.
I saw your weird dad butt, and I saw her aquamarine leotard bunched up around her ankles!
It scarred me for life.
I'm sorry.
I I didn't know you saw that.
Yeah, well, I did, and I never told Mom about it, but I swear to you, I will unless you leave right now.
Should be easy for you since it's your favorite thing to do aside from humping it up with ladies.
You think I'm way more sexually active than I am.
I mean, I've only had sex with, like, 400 women.
What?
Oh, my God.
Is that a lot?
I mean, all my friends are pilots.
I'm on the low end of average.
Listen.
I don't want to hurt your mother.
Please don't tell her about Sheila.
Fine, I won't, provided you leave right now.
Your move, white devil.
So if I'm correct, this should contain key number one!
Yay.
Open the door.
Oh, we need to find four keys.
And it took half our time just to find this one because I had to do it completely alone.
You're all useless.
Sorry.
I've been a little busy trying to solve the puzzle of how does one man chew so loud with just one mouth?
Sorry.
Could you stop kicking that thing for one minute, Hitchcock?
The TV's being a dick.
You got to turn it, like, four times just to change the damn channel.
Four times?
Try turning it to The coordinates for the Bay of Pigs.
And the military Nice job.
You broke the TV.
No, I found another key, you dolt.
So one was in a knight, the basketball teams were the Mustangs and Stallions.
We only need two more keys.
This just might work out after all.
You're damn right it will, 'cause we're a ragtag, scrappity, fart-dumb, moron parade, smart-ass team!
Okay, we're all good.
Raw garlic.
Cures everything.
It sure does, and it's so delicious.
Uh Where's your father?
Oh, Roger, you mean?
He left very suddenly.
Said something about "being the worst".
- What did you say to him, Jake?
- What?
Why do you assume that I said something?
He's a leaving jerk, so he left like a jerk.
This is what he does.
- He's not a monster.
- Yeah, well, you wouldn't say that if you knew - everything that he's done.
- What did he do, Jake?
Nothing.
You know, just, like super-awful life-changing things.
No follow-up questions.
Is it worse than the time he cheated on me with Sheila Bodden?
Ah.
You knew about that?
Yeah.
I knew about that.
The itsy bitsy spider Went up the water spout I can't believe you knew about Sheila.
I also knew about Wendy.
And Bonnie.
Bonnie who wears a wig?
She left it in our bathroom.
That's how I found out.
And also, remember your turtle, Graham Crackers?
Dad had sex with my turtle?
No, no, no, no, but he he stepped on it getting out of bed.
But you said Graham Crackers got married and moved in with his wife.
How did I not know any of this stuff?
Well, because you were a kid, and kids don't actually know a lot about their parents.
Jake, I've dated a lot of men in the last 20 years.
- You have?
- A lot.
Okay, you don't have to put so much mustard on it.
And I haven't met anyone I like.
But I like your father.
And I know he has been a selfish jerk, but he really has changed.
Last month when I had bronchitis, he flew in on his day off just to bring me soup.
It was this weird Canadian soup.
I-I think it was just all cheese.
But it was really nice.
Man, I feel stupid.
I was just trying to protect you, but I clearly made everything worse.
You have been protecting me since you were a kid.
Sometimes I think you got so good at it, you decided to become a cop and protect everyone.
Oh, that's a cool thought, but I became a cop because of "Die Hard".
I love you.
I love you, too, Mom.
Come here.
You know, I'm probably remembering a lot more nakedness than there actually was.
No, you're not.
Also, no one's gonna see it on that little TV.
Great news.
We were able to snag the new flat screen.
Your honor, Mr. Tran claims that he had no narcotics on him.
Fortunately, our detectives were equipped with body cams.
Someone's in here!
I think we all clearly saw where Mr. Tran threw the drugs in the trash right before he was apprehended.
At least it's over now.
Really?
How do we know those were drugs?
Please back that tape up.
No!
Objection!
On what grounds?
That's my penis?
Overruled.
Hey, man, look at that and tell me what you see.
A naked fool.
No.
Between the thighs and under the testicles, there's a bag of cocaine.
A bag of cocaine that's gonna get us a conviction and prove the value of body cams.
You know what I see?
A naked hero.
You're right, Sarge.
Thank you.
Now let's zoom in.
Whoop!
Over-zoomed.
Well, well, well.
Look who's trying to skip town.
You told me to.
Right.
Look, I talked to Mom, and I just want her to be happy.
So can we go back to my birthday party now?
I'd love that, son.
This is nice.
If you screw this up and hurt her in any way, I will throw you in jail for the rest of your life, and I can do that now, Dad, so do not test me.
Okay.
I still liked the hug even though you used it to threaten me.
Yeah, well I kind of liked threatening you, so Come on.
Okay, so we found key number three, thanks to Scully.
I was gonna eat those peaches anyway.
That leaves just one more key.
Team, what in this room is speaking to you right now?
Um, I'm intrigued by the phone.
It looks like it would be fun to call a friend on it it and talk about a third friend behind their back.
Interesting.
The dial tone's not steady.
I think it's Morse code.
I know Morse code!
My dad was a prisoner of war in Korea, and I could only talk to him Shut up.
Who cares?
Just decode the message.
It's a phone number.
Oh.
Booyakasha.
Ready?
One, two, three, four.
Congratulations.
We did it.
And we did it together because we're a team.
Should we do it again next week, sir?
No.
I would hate that.
Hey, honey.
Thanks for bringing Roger back.
You're very welcome.
Hey, by the way, Amy was really nervous to meet you, so don't judge her too harshly for all the weird singing.
Oh, no.
I'm dating my son of a bitch ex-husband.
Who am I to judge?
I think she's really great.
I think you're really great too!
She's very good at lip reading.
I wouldn't say I'm very good.
I mean, deaf people, they're the real talents.
Just can't stop.
I'll let you guys talk!
I'll just close my eyes.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the most anticipated event in this precinct's history.
The auction for The Suitcase of Mystery!
Exactly, Jacob.
This puppy's been in the lost and found since 1976.
No one alive today knows its contents.
I'm happy to say Captain Holt has finally given me permission to auction it off.
I'll let you give me a spray tan.
Any shade you want.
Jake, willing to sacrifice his dignity.
- Who can top it?
- Massage!
I'll give you a massage.
Charles, going in the wrong direction and getting himself disqualified.
Interesting approach.
"Orange Jake", going once, going twice.
I'll show you a picture of me in high school.
- There is side-pony.
- Ooh, Rosa coming in hot!
- Rosa coming in hot!
- I'll also give you full control of my hair and wardrobe!
I'll go on a date with you.
Sold!
To Jake, not to Scully.
That really freaked me out, and I just want this to end now.
Whoo!
So, there was this suitcase - I don't care.
- Yeah.
All right, everyone, enough morning chitchat.
Television happened, commutes were difficult, Boyle had a dream.
- I laid a goose egg on this - That's enough.
A pipe burst in the nine-eight, rendering the building uninhabitable.
They'll be sharing our space until the problem is fixed.
Oh, what?
A whole other precinct in here?
We're already packed in like sardines.
Look at this.
Man, I sure will love to be here to greet all these annoying losers, but sadly, Boyle and I are going to be on a stakeout all week.
Yeah, just two best buds stinking up a Saturn with our druthers of tunes and personal pan pizzas.
- That sucks.
- That sucks.
No one enjoyed that.
Look, I know this is an inconvenience; however, I expect you all to be accommodating to our guests.
Don't worry, sir, we will be cordial A. F. "As Frasier".
Love that show.
They're here.
I hate those nine-eight losers.
Ugh.
These guys are the worst.
Hey, Stevie Schillens?
Jakey P in the place to be.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were in the one-two-four.
I was, man, but then I arrested all the bad guys in Staten, so I transferred to the nine-eight.
So dope.
Everyone, put on your parkas, 'cause this week just got a whole a lot more chill.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Allow me to introduce Stevie "Chillin'" Schillens.
He was my very first partner and one of the all-time greats.
Takes one to know one, man.
Come on.
I'm Charles!
Wuh-oh.
Hey, what's up, man?
I'm Stevie.
We heard.
Stevie and I were beat cops together.
We called ourselves the Beatsie Boys.
And, yeah, it was as cool as it sounds.
So what'cha, what'cha - What'cha want?
- Cha want?
I get so funny with the money that you flaunt So, y'all would just stand around like that?
- Yeah!
- All the time.
Totally get it.
My first partner was also pretty cool.
Everyone called us "Chucky and the Coot".
So what'cha, what'cha - What'cha want?
- Cha want?
I get so funny with the money that you flaunt So, I guess we all had great partners that we've completely moved on from.
Because yours died of old age?
He did.
Anyway, we should motor.
Jake and I are staking out a bar called the Thirsty Ox lot of crime, lot of danger, lot of downtime for inside jokes.
"Would you like some milk"?
What?
"Would you like some milk"?
- The guy'cause you look like - I don't know - what you're talking about.
- "Would like the milk"?
- Please.
- What is it from?
He's funny.
He remembers.
Funny.
- Very funny.
- You know what's crazy?
I've been tracking a dealer who just took a job at the Thirsty Ox.
No crap.
We should work the case together.
The Beatsie Boys reunion tour?
Boys Will Always Be Boys.
No wait.
"Some Boys Never Change".
No wait.
"Boys to Man back to Boys".
No wait.
"Boy-ees"!
No wait.
Please, make yourself at home.
Captain, why are you doing this?
You hate people in your space.
Nonsense.
I'm an easygoing chap.
Okay.
I once saw you use a ruler to measure another ruler.
It was off by half a centimeter.
It never should've been in circulation.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Oh, he just sat at your desk.
Good.
Good.
I was hoping he would.
He's adjusting your chair settings.
Even the lumbar?
Exclusively the lumbar.
So my spine'll hurt a little.
It's only a highway holding all your body's nerves.
Mm-hmm.
You guys have an extra mouse for my computer?
No.
But, hey, here, you can borrow mine.
Terry knows his keyboard shortcuts!
Whoop.
Just deleted everything.
- Sir, we have a problem.
- Yeah, we do.
The line for the microwave is insane!
Seriously, Amy?
Your problem is Hitchcock and Scully's frozen burritos?
- No!
- Yeah!
Get our of here!
Ugh!
I'm trying to assemble my binders, but my new desk mate, Brian, brought a dog with him and my allergies are going crazy.
I'm so stuffy, I can't even enjoy that new binder smell.
He shouldn't have a pet in the precinct.
It's a "service animal" that he has made-up reasons.
I have mild foot pain, okay?
Francie helps me with that.
- How?
- Legally, you're not allow - to ask me that.
- Ugh.
That is nothing.
My new desk mate chats.
Now, I like to think of this little lady as a city girl who married a farmhand.
She also likes to look up recipes online and go, "Who's got the time"?
Okay.
Captain wants things running smoothly, so why don't you both just move and work from my desk?
- Fine.
- See?
Everything is gonna be fine.
Whoop, guy just took my whole computer.
The dealer I'm looking for is Tom Ozerov.
Arrested him a year ago on a first-degree felony, but he made a deal and walked.
Dude's a real lowlife.
Yeah, we've seen that guy.
I said he looked like a lowlife, remember that, Jake?
- His pants were too tight.
- Ah, yeah.
Hey, you know what else is too tight?
Us working a case together again.
- Swurt.
- Whoo!
Yeah, we say "noice," not "swurt".
Look, I'm so sorry, but I don't think there's room for a third person on this case.
Jake, we should work it solo.
Whoa, hang on that, Boyle.
Let's not be hasty.
I mean, Stevie's been tracking Ozerov longer than we have.
And three heads are better than two.
Three's a crowd.
Everybody knows that.
What about in "The Lion King," huh?
When Jamone and Purboy became friends with Steemba.
That's not the names.
It's Simba, Timon, and Pumbaa, but I appreciate you trying.
Really is a perfect analogy.
All right, I'm in.
Stevie can work the case.
Oh, right!
Charles Boyle, welcome to the Beatsie Boys.
Aww!
We're d-d-driving in a both: Car drug dealer's - Bar - Pass the mic right over to Charles We forgot Charles.
But we can't turn back, 'cause we're going to farles We have to turn back, though.
We can't leave him.
It was a good rhyme, though.
Hey.
Hey, buddy.
Look, I'm not gonna waste your time with some lame excuse about why we left you behind, all right?
Just the truth.
Stevie and I were taken hostage by an Armenian biker gang and thrown on a cargo ship headed to Asia, but we're back now.
Don't worry about it.
You can work the case without me.
I'm busy bonding with my new desk mate, Paul.
Hi, my name's Paul.
Shh, Paul, nobody cares.
Charles, I'm so sorry.
Don't be mad, okay?
We need you to work this case with us.
And you're way to good for Paul.
Stop trying to flatter me.
Jake, face it, I'm not a Beatsie Boy.
All right.
Well, then neither am I. The Beatsie Boys are finished.
If you're gonna be part of the group, we need a new name, a new name that you're gonna came up with.
- Police Pals.
- Okay, it's decent.
You can come up with a couple options.
Not necessary.
That's the one.
Okeydokey, let's go.
So, Gina, how's it going?
What's the gossip?
"What's the gossip"?
You can't stand being in your office with him, can you?
No, I'm just curious about your life.
I like to gab.
So, uh, tell me about boys.
Okay.
I hate this.
Captain, you gotta stand up to that office hog.
Be stern, like me.
Notice I'm not sharing a desk with Flynt's assistant.
'Cause he over there.
No eye contact.
Get back to work.
Ugh!
Listen.
You just say the word, and I will barge in there and kick that dude out.
Don't be ridiculous.
He is my superior officer.
But more to the point, he's a welcome guest, and I am a good host.
He locked you out of your own office, didn't he?
Yes, very much so.
Oh, Raymond.
Why do we all got to sit in the back?
Because we are all here together and we are all equals.
Yeah.
Hey, I've got an idea.
Why don't we listen some sweet stakeout jams?
Ooh, do you have the satellite radio station "Sedan Rock"?
Seriously?
Why not just go straight for the Toni Braxton while you're at it?
Oh, now you're gonna make fun of Toni?
Who is this joker?
Check it out.
Guy entering.
Wait, I know that dude.
He buys from Ozerov.
I mean, something's going down.
I say we gear up, and we bust in.
Like we did at Pacala Ristorante, remember?
That's how we do it in Brooklyn.
Yeah, okay, it sounds pretty cool, but Jake and I already talked how we'd play this.
We had a pretty sweet convo about it.
Remember?
I think we should do surveillance, collect Intel, and build a case.
Sure.
So, we all got stories, pal.
Look.
We need information.
If we bust in there and Ozerov doesn't have any drugs, our whole operation is blown.
But I know this guy, all right?
He never works out of one place for long.
I guarantee you he has drugs on him and if we don't get him now, we never will.
Well, too bad for you, because Jake agrees with me.
We're always on the same - Page?
- Yes!
Told you.
Actually, Charles, I think Stevie's right.
No.
You said "page".
I know, but he knows this case, and I trust his gut.
But, hey, let's go catch a bad guy together, right?
Gear up, Police Pals!
Hey, what is that?
Thought we were Beatsie Boys.
You didn't even tell him.
Rosa, do you need to listen to it that loud?
Yes!
I'm trying to drown out the sound from Ellen, the chat factory, over there.
My daughter got me a juicer for Christmas.
Did you know that you can juice nuts?
What?
I'm two seconds away from juicing Ellen.
I know it's tough, but Sarge Ah, no, shoo, shoo, shoo.
Shoo!
Shoo!
Oh, can you at least put her on a leash?
She's a medical professional.
Okay?
Would you keep a doctor on a leash?
That dog does not help you with your foot pain.
You just want an excuse to bring her everywhere!
Your dog is a fraud.
- Fraud dog!
- Come on.
Fraud dog!
Fraud dog!
- Fraud dog!
- Juice Ellen!
- Juice Ellen!
- Fraud dog!
Whoa!
Both of you, outside now!
I know it's crowded in there and they're not very considerate guests and they took my mouse and then they took my keyboard and then they took the whole computer.
And when I had nothing else to give, they came for my yogurt.
No, not just any yogurt.
Full fat Greek with a touch of honey.
That's a once a week treat!
What the hell are you guys doing out here?
Finally eating breakfast.
We snuck the microwave out here so we could cook our burritos like real policemen.
Now they have to use the toaster oven.
Enjoy your 16-minute cook times, idiots.
Guys, this is amazing.
Back off, it's our microwave!
Ours!
Nobody wants your microwave!
But look, the nine-eight's stuff is blocking the windows.
They can't see us out here.
It's so peaceful and spacious.
This could be our new beginning.
All right.
Can't let Ozerov ditch the drugs.
We got to go in fast and strong.
I don't know about you, but I can use some adrenalin.
A little slap-slap-boom?
- Mm.
- What's slap-slap-boom?
Oh, it's just this thing we used to do to get each other pumped up where we slap each other in the face; you don't have to do it.
No, I want to.
I want to go first.
Ow!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Shh.
There's movement.
But I'm the only one who got slapped in the face.
Charles, we gotta go!
NYPD!
Show me your hands!
Hey, Ozerov, I'll have a martini with a twist.
The twist?
You're under arrest.
None for me; I'm driving you to jail.
He's clean.
There's no drugs on him.
Damn it.
We wasted those cool lines on nothing.
Also, we blew the case.
That's obviously much worse.
That was my first thought.
Look, I know that we didn't find any drugs, but I still think it was worth the risk.
Well, I think it was a crap circus.
This whole operation is blown.
If you ask me, the Beatsie Boys should be called the Thoroughly Messed-Up Millies.
- What?
- I can't even imagine what you're going for.
I was being devastating!
Look, man, I get that you're pissed, but I am telling you, Ozerov is dirty.
Maybe, but if we had staked the bar out, we could've built up cases against a dozen guys here.
This place is filled with criminals.
I brought him in last month.
- Hey, Detective Boyle.
- Hi, Isaac.
The only good thing is, now this whole trio doesn't have to work together anymore.
Yes it does.
Charles, you did it.
- You saved the case.
- What?
Why?
I didn't want to.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but consorting with known felons is a parole violation, meaning we have grounds to search Ozerov's home.
Hell yeah!
Jakey P with the save!
Well, you know, Boyle is the one who pointed it out.
- He deserves the credit.
- True, true, true.
Good job, Earl!
You know my name is Charles.
So, if we're gonna start a secret office on the roof, we need equipment.
That means chairs, desks, printers, pens.
But we gotta sneak it out, so we need a distraction.
Okay, here is what I'm thinking.
We give that dog a bunch of chocolates.
It dies.
While everyone celebrates Okay, Amy's too close to this.
Rosa, you got any ideas?
Hitchcock and Scully just set fire to the kitchen sink.
Oh, boy.
Ooh, boy.
Perfect!
Let's use that.
I looked everywhere.
I didn't find anything.
- Did you?
- No.
But mirror top coffee table, iguana cage, samurai swords on the wall either this guy is a drug dealer or he uses Nick Cage's interior designer.
He might be a drug dealer, but we have nothing on him.
Quick question, guys.
Why did the drug dealer never do his dishes?
Because he has drugs in his dishwasher.
Oh, yeah!
- Dishwasher?
- Hit me.
Here, is for you.
- Hello?
- Hey.
What's up, dude?
It's me.
We got the drugs, man.
Hang on, Charles wants to say hi.
Do you have any milk?
Not a stranger in sight.
It's beautiful.
I've never heard the printer sound so happy.
I feel like it knows.
We did it.
A new world.
This must be how the founding fathers felt.
So what are you doing out here?
Captain, it's mayhem in there.
Those people are messy and selfish.
- And chatty.
- And out here, we can actually get work done.
- But - Sir, I'll handle this.
We love it.
We're proud of you.
- We want in.
- No.
You're acting like little children playing basketball who've fallen behind by several two-pointer buckets so you just take your basket home, and now no one else can play.
I know it's not the time, but you gotta watch basketball if you're gonna try to reference it.
Sergeant, this is boorish behavior.
I wanted you to be a good host.
You told me to make it work, and I came up with a creative solution.
Diaz finished her arrest reports.
Santiago did the filing of ten men.
I don't want to hear it.
Just clean up this mess and get back inside.
Paper jam.
It does know.
Attenzione, dingbats.
Perchance a riddle.
Shakespeare.
What has six thumbs and just arrested a drug dealer?
These guys.
Charles, thumbs up.
I said "six thumbs" and we're only showing four.
We're starting to look like fools.
Come on, Charles.
There it is.
- That's the ticket.
- Whoo!
All right, man, I'm gonna go check with Flynt.
You do some research on where we're gonna celebrate tonight.
Here's my only requirement: it has to be at your house 'cause I ain't got no money.
Uh, okay, how about at my house?
Swurt.
Yes!
Psst, hey.
What are you doing?
Come here.
What?
I think Stevie's bad news.
What?
Oh, come on, Charles.
You know, you've been acting weird about Stevie all day.
I think you might be jealous.
Of course I'm jealous.
I was never hiding that.
- How?
- He's tall.
He's funny.
He can pull off an earring.
He doesn't have an earring.
But we both know he'd look good with one.
Oh, my God What do you want me to say, Boyle?
I've been trying to include you in this all day long.
And, yes, I forgot you that one time, but I made up for it.
I slapped you in the face.
You're supposed to be my friend.
I'm an adult man, I can have two close friends.
Hell, I can have three close friends.
- You wouldn't.
- I would.
Maybe I'll get in touch with my friend James from college.
Ooh, or you know who just looked me up online?
Brad from camp.
Stevie planted the drugs.
Come on!
I looked on that dishwasher before him, and it was empty.
Stevie planted those pills.
But you're right, he's the coolest!
You guys should go get your ears pierced together.
Invite Brad.
It'll be smurt.
It's swurt, not smurt.
So, joke it's on you.
Damn it, Stevie!
Hey, I logged the drugs.
You know what that means.
It's time to celebrate.
You know what that means.
Let's eat big sandwiches!
I gotta talk to you in private.
Come on.
Okay.
Uh, this is cozy.
Well, the precinct is so crowded, this is the only place no one can hear us talk.
Listen.
I know you planted the drugs at Ozerov's place.
What?
Charles checked the dishwasher, and he didn't see any drugs.
Yeah, well, they were there.
All right?
I guess he just missed them.
Probably busy hiking up his pants above this belly button.
He has to do that because they don't make pants short enough for him.
Look.
Don't lie to me, man.
Dude, the guy is a drug dealer.
All right?
I wasn't gonna let him walk again.
But you get it, though, right?
You're not a tight-ass like Charles.
You know, I wish I was like Charles.
He's a good cop and an honest person, and when we go on stakeouts, we do listen to Toni Braxton and it's super sad and it's awesome.
I can't believe I'm saying this, Stevie, but I gotta report you.
Ow!
Did you just Donkey Kong punch me?
There's no room to regular punch you.
Ooh, all right.
It's on.
- Ahh!
- What's going on?
He did plant the drugs.
You trusted me.
Oww!
Son of a bitch!
I hope there's room - in this fight for three.
- There's not.
You have a 2:30 meeting with small head big body.
I forgot to take his name.
D.A. Brayburn.
Deputy Inspector Flynt, do you mind if we have a meeting here in the office?
Actually, I do mind.
I'm not really in the mood for company.
I just had a bad loss in an online poker game.
Of course.
Anything for our guests.
Get back here, you crap basket.
You're going down!
Help!
He's attacking me for no reason!
Stevie Schillens, you have the right to remain - A loser.
- Noice.
But, now legally, I have to start over, Charles.
Stevie Schill Oh!
Get off him.
We just made up.
Paul?
I thought we had something.
Get nine-eight.
Hope your dog will help with neck pain.
Oh!
She doesn't help with any pain.
I made it up.
Ha!
I knew it!
Hey, Ellen.
I got your farm girl.
You wouldn't.
Bessy!
Terry got his computer back.
Oh, come on!
Sarge, take off your shirt!
It's restricting your movement.
What the hell is going on here?
Yeah.
What are you guys doing?
Brawling with other police officers?
What were you thinking?
Sir, I had nothing to do with this.
I was arresting a dirty cop.
I heard you scream out "I love this"!
Yes.
"This" being justice.
I love justice.
And to make matters worse, our radiator was broken during your wild street-ball scrum.
So now we have no heat.
Which means we'll have to work in the freezing cold, and our guests from the nine-eight will have to relocate again.
No smiles.
No smiles.
This is a sad day for our precinct.
Dismissed.
Captain.
You know what's kinda weird?
There was no one was fighting over by the radiator.
You were the only person standing near it.
I suppose, in the hubbub, I may have tripped and busted a pipe.
I knew it!
I knew you couldn't stand having someone in your space.
He used my letter opener to cut his tuna sandwich in half!
You were right.
They were disrespectful and had to go.
And, yes, sometimes you have to come up with a creative solution.
And sometimes just a bunch of dudes need to get into a room and just "Take that!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"!
That's not the lesson here.
Okay, Captain.
Unbreak my heart Say you love me again You know what?
I like this song!
This hurt that you caused - Hey, you don't get to sing.
- Shut up!
- The nerve.
- Unbelievable Uncry these tears I cried so many nights
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
1 Hey, Gina!
We got an anonymous gift basket.
Yeah, it's full of treats.
It's got meats, cheeses, candies, all the food groups.
The cheese is amazing.
It melts in my mouth and in my hands.
Hmm, French chocolates, French cheeses, tiny French pickles.
Did none of you detectives think this might be a gift for Captain Holt from someone in France?
Like his husband, par exemple?
What?
No way.
This is a nice present from an unknown, appreciative citizen that wanted us to munch.
Hmm, what's this, then?
"Dear Captain Raymond Holt, thinking of you.
Best, Dr. Kevin Cozner, Ph.D." He even used their pet names.
Oh, no, I ate the chocolate-covered strawberry.
That's the most intimate snack of them all.
Holt's gonna be back from his meeting in 30 minutes.
- What do we do?
- Eat the note!
No!
No.
It's okay.
We can fix this.
Check it out, sir.
A lovely gift basket that Kevin sent you all the way from Paris.
Straight from Paris!
Stapler, scissors.
Rubber bands.
That man really knows me.
Attention, squad.
I just received a call.
A very important, very high profile celebrity was robbed in our precinct.
What celebrity, sir?
Is it a Chris?
Hemsworth?
Evans?
Pratt?
Pine?
Brown?
Cross?
Is it a non-Chris?
This is a sensitive matter, and I can only disclose details to the lead detective on the case.
Sergeant, let me know who's available, ASAP.
Yes, sir.
Sarge, Sarge, Sarge.
You know that I'm your guy for this.
You can't give a celebrity case to Amy.
The last movie she saw was a documentary about spelling bees.
Wrong; it was about the font Helvetica, and it played like an action thriller.
You already have a case, Peralta.
I assigned it to you this morning.
That was just some kid with a little bit of pot on him.
Meanwhile, Chris Rock is tied up in his basement calling out for my help, and you're standing in my way.
Just work the case I assigned you.
Can't I just give my case to Hitchcock and Scully?
I mean, they clearly have a ton of time on their hands.
Hitchcock hasn't even gotten out of his chair today.
Hey, Jake, I can go anywhere in this thing.
But shouldn't.
Hitchcock and Scully are house mouses.
They do paperwork and they're good at it.
They don't go out in the field.
Boyle, you take the celebrity case.
Me?
Instead of Jake?
Have you lost your damn mind?
I am so sorry, Jake.
I don't know what's wrong with Terry.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna work it with you.
I'm giving my drug bust to Hitchcock and Scully.
It's time to get these mice out of their hice.
Oh, that was lame.
Life is meaningless.
We're all gonna die.
Mouses out of their houses.
Yes, I am the greatest.
Every breath is a gift.
Sorry about the roller coaster.
I'm just happy I'm tall enough to ride.
Hey, Rosa.
Saw you hadn't signed up for the blood drive yet, so I brought you the sheet.
Sorry, can't.
I'm under 17 years old.
Wait, you didn't sign up last year, either.
Or the year before.
Are you afraid of needles?
I don't like being stabbed by someone so they can steal my blood.
I'm crazy.
This is amazing; you're scared of something I'm not.
I'm tougher than you.
I'm tougher than Rosa.
Eh, I take it back.
I'm so sorry.
Look, it's okay.
We all have fears.
I'm so claustrophobic, I can't even go into the downstairs supply closet.
I hear they have some hot new binder clips, but I'll never know.
I'm scared of businessmen.
A whole army of gray-suited Brads and Chads trying to suck my soul and redeem it for frequent flyer miles.
Great, so you guys get it.
- Conversation over, bye.
- No, no, no, no, no.
What if we each agree to face one of our fears today for ourselves and for all of womenkind?
Ugh.
That sounds terrible.
But I'm in.
Fine, I'll do it too.
Guys, come on.
I really think this'll be good for oh, wait.
You we're doing my thing?
Okay.
Thanks for taking us to lunch, Jake.
Of course.
Get whatever you want.
Oh, man, I already ate.
I guess I'll just have a cheeseburger deluxe, couple slices of pie, maybe an egg cream.
- Okay.
- And a waffle.
So look, a big, important drug case came across my desk, and I need your help.
Only problem is, Sarge doesn't think you can handle it.
- He's right.
- No, he's not.
Look, you're Hitchcock and Scully.
You guys are legends.
You single-handedly caught the Prospect Park Flasher.
Well, he was being chased by other cops, but he did slip on my spilled chili.
And who bumped into Scully, causing the spill?
Me.
Damn right, and who fell asleep under their desks and caught the janitor stealing evidence?
We did.
And who sued the department and got triple-ply toilet paper in every precinct?
We did.
Terry thinks you guys are too old and too lazy to handle this, but I know what you're really made of.
You're gonna take this case and prove him wrong!
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!
We're still gonna eat lunch, right?
Obviously, a high profile celebrity case such as this one needs to be handled with the utmost discretion.
I promise I'll be professional, even if it's Dianne Wiest.
Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm gonna meet Dianne Wiest!
She's so sexual!
No, our victim is John William Weichselbraun.
Remind me who that is again?
You're kidding.
He's a world-renowned oboist, first chair with the New York Symphony Orchestra.
Kevin and I are huge fans of Weichselbraun's work.
We are what the Internet sometimes refers to as Weichselbraun fans.
Not Weichselbrauniacs?
Oh, that's very good.
I'm gonna use that liberally.
Anyway, Weichselbraun's $40,000 oboe was stolen from his apartment, and you need to find it.
I'd work the case myself if it didn't smack of preferential treatment.
Don't worry, sir.
I can handle this.
So you do think it smacks of preferential treatment?
I don't know what you want me to say.
Okay, you've convinced me.
I'll work the case with you.
Great.
I think you owe me an apology.
I'll apologize to you in hell.
I actually don't know what this is about.
Sorry I took such a hard stance.
Holt's celebrity was just some lame oboist.
Meanwhile, we just linked your little dumb pot bust to a major narcotics ring.
This might be the biggest drug case the Nine-Nine's had in years.
Cool.
Uh-oh.
I know a real "cool" when I hear one.
That wasn't a real "cool".
What did you do?
Well I may have given that very huge drug case to Hitchcock and Scully.
- What?
- In my defense, I was pretty sure you were never gonna find out.
I don't know where Hitchcock and Scully are.
They're not answering their phones, and they signed our dealer the one link to our drug ring out of holding.
I swear, if they mess up this case, Jake, it's on you.
They're detectives.
They've been on the force for 500 years.
They know what they're doing.
The only item on Scully's calendar for the entire year is "eat peanut butter".
Yeah, we got to find them.
And to do that, we have to think like they do.
I'm going in.
All right, there's the butt indentation, and  I'm docked.
Ugh.
Still warm.
All right, residual cushion fart is about a six out of ten.
He's been gone an hour, maybe two.
- But where?
- Hot dogs.
- They went for hot dogs.
- How do you know?
There's a water stain on the ceiling in the shape of a bun.
Let's go.
Excuse me, have you seen Hitchcock and Scully?
Three times a day for 12 years.
Twice as often since I started serving sweet wieners.
Sweet wieners?
It's a normal hot dog with a little chocolate sauce.
- One please!
- No, Jake.
- No, Terry.
- Have you seen them recently?
Half hour ago they ate, and then they took off in a hurry.
Half an hour.
They could be anywhere by now.
Nope, there's Scully.
Where's Hitchcock?
I'm taking you guys off your drug case.
Of course you are.
Jake said you didn't believe in us.
What?
He didn't believe in you either.
He was just pumping you up with lies so you'd work his case.
Jake, is this true?
I just thought, you know, the two of you might be better off mousing around the old house.
Oh, I get it.
Just because I got my finger stuck in a glue trap once, I'm a mouse?
I got the cheese out, by the way.
- Oh, my God.
- Look, man, we need to know where Hitchcock is.
I am ordering you to tell us everything.
Fine.
We're setting up a sting.
I'm going undercover as Tex Dallas, billionaire oil man from Dallas, Texas, with ties to the cowboy mafia.
- Oh, boy.
- Hitchcock's my middle man, Reno Vegas, mobster from Reno, Las Vegas.
I said my "oh, boy" too soon.
In 20 minutes, he's going in totally alone, unarmed, without a cell phone, to meet with one of their guys to set up a buy.
So how do you like our plan now?
It's a disaster, man!
We got to stop it!
Disaster?
Tell me one thing that's wrong with Operation Beans.
Operation Beans?
Good afternoon, sir.
I'm Detective Charles Boyle From the Nine-Nine.
My precinct.
I'm the captain, Raymond Holt.
Okay.
Uh, please, come on in.
I'll show you the back room where they broke in.
You're an incredibly gracious host, Mr. Weichselbraun.
Wow, that pronunciation is flawless.
I must admit, I'm a bit of a Weichselbrauniac.
Hmm, I saw you perform Bach's "Oboe Sonata in G Minor" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
I was in the front row.
You were escorted out for gasping too loudly.
Ah.
This is a pretty modest apartment.
How did you afford a $40,000 oboe in the first place?
I admit that there's not as much money in classical music as there once was Which is the real crime here.
Boyle, can I talk to you privately?
Sure.
What are you doing?
You just insulted our celebrity victim to his face.
You keep saying "celebrity," but he's drying his socks on a George Foreman grill.
This is John William Weichselbraun, the Silver Spit Prince.
I'm making myself primary detective on this case.
You can wait in the car.
Oh, but first, take a picture of the two of us together.
Make sure we're laughing.
Ha-ha!
Ah.
Okay, so, I'm going to face my fear of confined spaces.
When I'm ready, you will shut the trunk and leave me here for 30 minutes.
I left a juice box and a diaper in there for you, so you're gonna be fine.
Or we could all give in to our fears and keep our blood in our bodies like normal people.
No, Rosa, we are doing something important here.
We are women, standing up and supporting each other and becoming New fear: listening to Amy inspire us.
Be back in a half hour, Ames.
Wait!
Come back!
Come back, I can't do this!
- No, you're the best!
-  You did it.
How'd it go?
Well, the first ten minutes were really terrible.
The diaper did not fit.
It was for a baby.
But then I relaxed, and I found my inner strength.
I think the lesson here is that, as women, we No, no, no, no!
You close that trunk again and I will kill you!
You hear me?
I will kill you!
We're almost there.
Slow down, Pinto.
I didn't agree to a bean name.
We are not doing Operation Beans.
You know, the only reason Hitchcock and I took this case is because you said we were great.
I'm beginning to think you were lying to us.
I was lying!
I already admitted that.
Well, if anything happens, it's because of you.
- Right, Mung?
- Right.
If Hitchcock dies, it's 'cause of Pinto.
Terry, I know that you're mad, but you don't have to jump on the bean train.
Uh-oh.
Chickpea!
No!
Looks like they're taking Hitchcock inside that building, and it looks like they're armed.
Dammit, Jake!
You couldn't just do the case I assigned you?
Hitchcock's life is in danger.
He has a wife, man.
Don't worry.
If anything happens to him, she'll be taken care of.
If I die, I want you to marry Lucille.
I can't stand the thought of you being alone.
Deal.
Let's make it a blood pact.
Oh, look, I'm already bleeding.
So just normal friend stuff.
- So what's the plan?
- We stick with Operation Beans.
We knock on the front door.
I say I'm Tex Dallas.
You're my buddy, Alamo, and you're Black Fred.
Black Fred?
Why Black Fred?
There's no other Fred!
Yeah, but they don't know that.
I say Terry and I go in through the roof and do some recon.
Scully, you stay here and call for backup in case we need it.
Oh, no way.
That's my partner in there.
I'm going in.
Also, I can't call for help.
I don't have any quarters.
Hard to argue with that logic.
- You know I - Sir, I need to talk to you about the Weichselbraun case.
Oh, I didn't realize you were here, Mr. Weichselbraun.
I was in the area, and the captain is a fan, so I came by to give him a little gift, as a thank you.
It's a signed copy of his book of mouth exercises.
"Reed It and Weep".
"Reed" with two Es?
It's my favorite joke of all time.
- I'll come back later.
- Oh, nonsense.
I'm sure John he insists I call him "John" I'm sure John would appreciate an update on the whereabouts of his oboe, wouldn't you, John?
- Yeah.
- Well said, John.
- Did you hear what John said?
- I did, but it's an open investigation, and I don't think it's proper to share information with the parties involved.
Well, that's why you're no longer the primary.
John played oboe for Lynne Cheney.
I'm sure we can trust him to be discreet.
- Out with it.
- Okay, well, John, you're under arrest.
- What?
- Excuse me?
He staged the robbery for the insurance money because he's broke, because oboists are not celebrities.
This is ludicrous, Boyle.
Do you have one iota of evidence?
I found the oboe for sale online.
We traced the IP address back to Mr. Weichselbraun's computer.
Oh, John.
Okay, Sarge, everyone knows you're a superhero, so you lower Scully and I into that skylight and then fly down to meet us.
- You know that's impossible.
- Fine.
We'll lower Scully down together, and then flop onto him like a giant mattress.
No, you go first, then I lower Scully, and you you get to catch him.
Great.
I love that plan.
Come on.
Whoa!
I got him.
- Look what I found.
- French fries?
What?
No, it's Hitchcock.
Where would I have found French fries in a weed farm?
Oh, man, look at him.
This is bad.
He hates standing up.
To conquer my fear of businessmen, I must walk among them.
I will shake their clammy hands and listen to them talk about things like how hard Wednesdays can be.
Does this outfit look drab and lifeless enough?
Also, thanks, Amy, for letting me borrow it.
You're welcome.
I wore that suit to prom.
Student chaperone.
I guess this is really happening.
How about those quarterly write-offs?
And did you hear about the merger?
Also, we all need to go in on those flowers for Beth.
Aw, Wednesdays.
Who are you again?
Gina, from Sales.
I have the plant on my desk.
Oh, yeah.
You want to sit with us.
We'll all be dead so soon.
What?
I would love to sit.
Ugh.
That was a nightmare.
I ate a Caesar salad wrap.
I'm so proud of you, you lioness.
You faced your fear.
And I emerged victorious.
Yay!
That was a wig?
You didn't think I'd put my actual hair in a ponytail?
Are you insane?
Oh, there's the boss.
I ask only one time.
Who do you work for?
DEA?
FBI?
Police?
I'm in the cowboy mafia.
I work for the Dallas Buyers Club.
- I came up with that name.
- No, you didn't.
It's a movie about AIDS.
You're lying.
Let's try again.
- FBI?
- Oof!
- DEA?
-  - Police?
- Aah!
Oh no, he's not gonna last.
Oh, Jake, you got to do something.
I don't want to marry Hitchcock's wife.
Here we come, Chickpea.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Easy!
Howdy there!
I'd really appreciate it kindly if y'all would stop punching my associate Reno, there.
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Alamo.
This here's Tex, and this is Fred.
Just Fred.
And we are the Dallas Buyers Club.
Okay.
We make a deal.
Sounds good.
No, I just told them to surround you.
Dagnabbit.
Oof!
Look, Sarge, I'm sorry that we're in this mess, but on the bright side, we don't have to deal with some lame oboist.
You should be apologizing to Hitchcock and Scully.
You took them out of their house mouse comfort zone, and now they might get killed.
You really think they're going to kill us?
Oh, no, now I'm starting to panic sweat.
Starting to?
What have you been doing for the past hour?
- Normal sweating.
- Wait a minute.
If you get killed, what happens to all your debt?
Loophole!
Oh, you sweaty, chair-spinning morons.
You're gonna get us out of here.
Boyle, may I speak to you?
I don't know.
Are you still mad that I arrested John?
No.
I know he's guilty.
I'm just chagrined.
Deeply chagrined.
I finally understand the old adage, "Never meet your heroes".
This is just like when I found out Robert Frost was from California.
Or when I saw Mario Batali with his hair down.
Well, you've handled this case with the utmost professionalism, while I've behaved crassly.
I think I've figured out a way to make it up to you.
Oh, my God, is Dianne Wiest here?
No, I've hired a trio of classical musicians to perform a Shostakovich cantata, originally written as an apology to a dear friend.
Are you stealing kitchen supplies?
Just let us have this stuff.
You have so much, and we have so little.
Perhaps I'll just buy you a drink instead.
Yeah, that would be best.
Classical musicians are savages.
They're not gonna kill you fast, Scully.
They're gonna make it real slow.
First they're gonna scalp you, and then they're gonna rip your tongue out!
No.
That's my cupcake taster!
What are you doing?
Lay off him!
Never!
For my plan to work, he's gotta be basting in sweat.
Hitchcock, you once told me you could roll that chair anywhere.
Think you could take it up those stairs?
I once rode a chair home in a blizzard.
So, yeah, I can go up stairs.
So do it.
Oh, he's amazing.
He's like a big, lazy Michelle Kwan.
But how's he gonna get up the stairs?
Jake!
He already did.
Okay, it's go time.
Help!
My man's having a heart attack!
Help!
Hitchcock, now!
Scully!
Grab his gun.
It's not sticky because I'm so juicy!
Told you I knew what I was doing.
Black Fred, think quick.
No, no, ow!
That was a gun, man!
Scully, grab that dude's knife and cut us loose.
We're gonna get the rest of these guys.
It's time for Operation Beans, phase two, the refrying.
Sure you're ready to go through with this?
You know what?
Today was stupid.
But seeing you both overcome your fears did help me, and I think we've all grown as women.
Okay.
I'm ready.
Stab me!
Stab me!
Do it, just do it!
- Rosa?
- I'm psyching myself up.
Don't look at them!
Look at me!
Do your job!
Drain me!
There they are!
Everybody give it up for Hitchcock and Scully.
To thank you for all you did, bringing down a drug ring, we have a little present for you: brand-new, top-of-the-line desk chairs, extra padding, with adjustable height and recline.
Hey, chair!
Get ready to meet your new best friend: my ass.
That was very nice of you.
They did good.
Also, I was worried they might want to go out in the field more, and I need something to keep them at their desks.
You really think that that is going to keep them at their and they're both asleep already.
And the city's safer for it.
Sleep tight, you magnificent oafs.
You deserve it.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
1 Hey Jake, can I show you something over here?
Sure thing, bud.
I'm trying to send Genevieve a sexy pic.
Does this make my bubble butt pop?
Nope.
I'm out.
-  Who's that?
-  I don't know.
Um, excuse me, pal.
Think you're at my desk.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Drop it!
Drop the weapon!
Don't be a dum-dum.
Squad, meet Detective Adrian Pimento.
He's been deep undercover for the last 12 years, but he's just resurfaced, and he's rejoining the Nine-Nine.
That is awesome!
Some of you just met Detective Pimento, and, of course, some of you knew him before he went undercover.
Hitchcock and Scully.
Ha.
You guys still work here?
The only way they're getting rid of us is in a body bag.
It actually happened once, but it was a false alarm.
Detective Pimento will be returning to his old desk.
Peralta will temporarily be moved to the break room.
Questions?
What'd you do undercover?
I worked for Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis.
That is an A-list mobster.
Tell me literally everything.
Everyone, shut up!
Pretty much just a bagman for him.
I mean, I did some other stuff.
Um, we usually try to tell funnier little stories.
Well, there's nothing funny about what I did for The Butcher.
I've had to learn not to blink, because every time I close my eyes, I see a fresh horror.
Ooh, dark.
But how do you keep your eyes moist?
Actually, I have a very funny story about keeping my eyes moist.
Come on  Nope.
Still not getting that vibe, man.
- Really?
- Mm-mm.
I'll get there.
That's my bad, everybody.
Dismissed.
Sir, can I partner with Pimento on my B&E?
That guy is awesome.
He's like a real life Donnie Brasco.
Isn't Donnie Brasco a really sad movie that ends terribly?
Yeah, but he's got that cool jacket, and he's always down at the docks.
I'm not sure I want you working with Pimento.
He's a little unstable.
Machine!
Psychologically, this could be a very difficult transition.
Yeah, I know, I went undercover.
63 days, no big deal.
You probably forgot.
No, it's your outgoing voice mail message.
Hey, it's Jake.
Can't get to the phone right now.
I might be undercover again, like I was for 63 days.
Bye!
Look, I know what he's going through.
Let me be the man that brings him in from the cold.
All right, he can work the B&E with you.
Just make sure you take it easy.
Uh, sir, I was 20 minutes late for work today.
I don't think you need to tell me about taking it easy.
Are you bragging about being a bad employee?
No.
Dismissed?
Me?
I figured out the best way to welcome Pimento to the Nine-Nine.
Stay out of his way, maybe buy him a drink, not do anything weird?
I'm making him a goat stew.
Huh all right.
Yeah, now, this Turkmenistani dish is traditionally made from an animal that's been so overfed it can no longer stand.
That's the dream.
Everything is authentic.
I even ordered the pressure cooker from Turkmenistan.
So you're on a terrorist watch list now?
Oh, yeah, Homeland Security's been in my house, yep.
Now, this just needs to cook for another 11 hours, 32 minutes, and 6  What the hell, Boyle!
You almost killed me!
I'm not going out in a stew-making accident!
Terry's gonna die saving the President, or Terry's never gonna die!
There's no way we can clean this up by ourselves.
We're gonna need help.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What are you saying?
You know what she's saying, man.
Oh, no.
Mean Marge.
So we're supposed to come running to clean up your mess every time you snap your fat little fingers?
Oh, no, no, I actually can't snap my fingers, they're always too wet.
And I just thought, since it's your job Oh, I see.
You cops think you're too good to clean up after yourselves?
Uh no, I can do it myself, I'll just That's union work!
How dare you try to steal our jobs.
So where do we go from here?
Well, you know the old saying, "The only way to unclog a toilet is to let it sit".
You're a janitor.
You should know that's not true.
Boys, take out the trash.
Oh, great!
So you will do it?
Oh!
I'm the trash, I get it.
Okay, that makes more sense with your tone.
Oops!
Oh Love you, Marge.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Yes, I have a special project for you.
Okay, but I'll have you know right now I only fly first class.
I'm not flying you anywhere.
I made an application to the M.C. Guffin Foundation for a grant to upgrade our office equipment.
Unfortunately, they require a video submission.
I understand you have some filmmaking experience.
Well, you know, I've been re-Vined by Rob Kardashian, so, yeah, I'm a director.
Here's what I'm picturing: I enter, in, like, a Fellini-style getup.
Rosa's dressed like a porcupine Oh, no, no.
We're just gonna do a simple, straightforward tour of the precinct featuring Detective Diaz and me.
Are you sure?
You're not our most dynamic screen presences.
I can be dynamic.
Exclamation point.
Well, Diaz and I have that kind of easy chemistry - where we finish each other's - Sentences.
Please, don't interrupt me.
That kind of nonsense won't happen on camera.
Hey, hey, Pimento.
Hey!
This is my desk, okay?
Okay, well, now that that's out of the way, I was just coming to let you know we're gonna work a B&E together; we're gonna be partners.
Nope.
I work alone.
Plus, The Butcher says he has spies in the NYPD, so I trust none of these dildos.
Listen, you can trust me.
- I'm, like, obsessed with you.
-  Fine.
Tell me something you've never told another living soul.
Um Ooh, here's one.
I'm actually not strong enough to lift a water cooler jug, so I always find a way to make Terry do it.
Here's mine.
Jimmy "The Butcher" made me drive a croquet wicket through a guy's eyes into his brain.
Brain leaked out his eyes like he was crying his own mind.
My goodness.
Now that I've heard yours, I feel like my water cooler thing could have been a little more juicy, but No.
That was embarrassing for you.
A bond has been made.
Feels good to trust again, brother.
Wow, either you are a cyborg or you're carrying so many weapons in this jacket.
Hey.
Kitchen, now.
Okay.
What's up?
Something's not right about that guy.
Why, just because he keeps threatening to kill me in the middle of a police precinct?
Uh, grow up.
Because I'm physically attracted to him.
And that's bad?
I'm only attracted to creeps: the Vulture, the ShamWow guy, and when I was a kid, I had a major crush on the evil Gremlin.
Stripe?
Are you crazy?
Yeah, well I'm not gonna bone Gizmo.
- I would.
- Careful with Pimento.
It's gonna be fine.
Hey, partner.
- Oh!
- I've been waiting for you.
Sorry if I surprised you.
It's just when I was undercover, the middle of the night was the only time I could do actual police work.
Uh, how'd you get in the apartment?
Oh, it was easy.
I just seduced the old lady upstairs, came down the fire escape, jimmied the window open.
Bing-bang-boom, I'm inside your living quarters.
Totally.
Course, next time you could just give me a call, you know.
Two ways to pop in on a friend.
I didn't kill the old lady upstairs, if that's what you're worried about.
Well, I am now.
Oh, wait a minute.
You think I'm being weird.
Oh, I shouldn't have come here.
This is your apartment.
I'm so sorry, Jake!
Stupid, Paul!
Stupid!
You idiot, Paul!
- Hey!
Pimento!
- Huh?
!
- Who's Paul?
- Whoa.
Paul Sneed was my undercover name.
'Kay?
Damn it, Jake.
I don't know who I am anymore.
You could have chose any name to go undercover, and you picked Paul Sneed?
Seems kind of crazy.
I shouldn't have come here.
This was a mistake.
I'm not ready.
I knew I wasn't ready to go back to being police.
It's the only job I've ever had except for bagging groceries at the supermarket at the corner of Atlantic and Clinton.
I guess I could go back to that again.
"Paper or plastic"?
Yeah, still got it.
Listen to me, I was undercover.
63 days with the Mafia.
I saw some messed-up stuff.
I know what your struggle is.
And I can bring you home, but you've got to trust me.
Okay.
Yeah.
Great.
Now, I've got to get some sleep.
You're welcome to stay here and work the case if you want.
Thanks, partner.
I promise I won't disturb you at all.
Whuuuhhhh.
Whuuuhhhh.
- Hey, Pimento.
- Huh?
I thought you were just gonna be looking through the files - or something, man.
- Sorry, brother.
Tai chi helps keep the demons at bay.
Right.
And Do you have to do it in your underwear?
I can't take them off, 'cause then you'd be looking right at my penis and testicles.
Can't argue with that logic.
Mm-kay.
Why is there so much garbage in here?
Mean Marge won't clean up the stew.
And also, she suspended our trash service.
What happened?
You didn't grovel enough, did you?
Seriously, Amy, you're gonna ask Charles Boyle if he groveled enough?
Come on!
This is the grossest thing I've ever seen, and I have three kids under the age of four.
I live in a house of fluids.
Look, I have a plan, okay?
We're just gonna go over Mean Marge's head and we're gonna tell Holt.
Tell me what?
Oh, well, I don't know if you noticed, but there was an accident in the break room yesterday.
Oh, yes, shattered windows, bones everywhere.
It's very "New York in the 70s".
Clean it up.
The, uh, problem is Marge in facilities is refusing to help.
We were actually hoping maybe you could ask her.
Excuse me?
I'm the captain of this precinct.
I don't have time to mediate your petty squabbles.
I've taken a sacred oath to protect this community, and that is a job I take seriously.
So you're afraid of her, too, huh?
Terrified.
Yeah, perp knew where the camera was.
Must have cased the joint ahead of time.
We're gonna need all your footage from the past week.
Ha-ha-ha.
This is an amateur job.
Everybody knows you break in when the owner's there.
That way you have guaranteed access to the safe, and you can kick his teeth in to send a message.
Okay, why don't you just Oh, sure, you could slit his throat, but then what are you going to do with all the blood?
Uh, we'd leave it in his body, where blood lives, because we're cops.
Oh, right, we're cops.
And don't worry, sir.
We're gonna catch these bastards, - or my name isn't Paul Sneed.
- Adrian Pimento.
Adrian Pimento.
So, what'd they take?
About $15,000 worth of stuff.
TVs, cameras, bunch of pre-paid cell phones.
Ooh, you sell burner phones?
What kind of deals you got on those?
Why do you want to know about the deals?
Just gathering evidence for the case, 'cause I'm a cop, remember?
- Detective Paul Sneed.
- Adrian Pimento.
Adrian Piment I I know who I am you know what forget this!
Ah okay.
Hey, hey, hey, come on, man.
Look, I get it you're still tense.
When I came back from being undercover, they made me see a shrink.
But then he told me I had dad issues, and I was like, "You know what, you can't tell me what to do, you're not my dad," so he was a moron.
No, you know what, that's good advice thanks, man, thanks.
I I'll be right back, I just left something inside.
Hey, give me one of those.
Why are you buying a burner phone?
Cue smoke machine.
And action Holt.
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.
I'm Captain Raymond Holt.
And I'm Detective Rosa Diaz.
I don't understand why I'm on a wheelchair.
Cut!
For the last time, Rosa, through the magic of special effects, the wheelchair will turn into a horse, but I need you to work with me.
Give me a little "hee-yah"!
Hee-yah!
This is idiotic.
Maybe because you didn't karate chop your way through the smoke, as scripted.
I'm out.
Scully.
Rosa!
Hee-yah, hee-yah.
I wanted a simple, straightforward video tour of the precinct, and you've added the one ingredient I didn't want: pizzazz.
Pizzazz is who I am.
Would you tell the sky to stop being so blue?
- Yes.
I wish it were tan.
- What?
It's my favorite color.
It's no-nonsense.
Hey, I've been tailing Pimento, and I think you were right.
There's something weird going on with that guy.
I knew it.
Ugh!
I can't believe I'm gonna sleep with him.
Well, you don't have to.
No, I'm gonna.
He secretly bought a burner phone, he broke into my apartment and he keeps forgetting he's a cop and calling himself by his alias, Paul Sneed.
Paul Sneed?
He said Figgis has spies in the NYPD.
Rosa, what if he's one of them?
What if he turned?
Oh, here he comes.
Oh, man, bolt cutters?
Bolt cutters have literally never been used by an innocent person.
I use them all the time when I make jewelry.
What?
Oh, my God.
Follow-up questions later.
All right, I got to keep following him.
All right, but be careful.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'll be invisible.
Now you see me, now you  - 'Cause here's my number - Ah So call me maybe -  - We're cool, we're cool.
Everything's still cool.
He didn't hear me, we're cool.
Rosa.
Pimento just put on a ski mask and broke into a creepy abandoned warehouse.
Mm, that's hot.
It is?
Oh, wait, he's coming back out.
Did he do something super shady?
Are his eyes all wild?
- Rosa, focus.
- Sorry.
Send a pic.
Bye.
Okay, guess we're done talking.
Well, they still haven't cleaned up in there, but the good news is I got a new plan.
I let one of the perps accidentally get out of holding, then I take him down to the break room.
Oopsie.
Now it's a whole crime scene.
And then we can get crime scene cleaners.
- Boom.
- Not so fast.
That room gets clean when I say it gets cleaned.
You can't stop us now.
You ever heard the old saying, "Know the garbage, know the man"?
That's not a saying.
Yes, it is.
I know all your secrets.
Boyle.
You got a taste for fast food.
Those aren't mine.
I only eat locally-sourced meats.
They could be Terry's.
He was fat once, you know?
What the hell, Boyle?
Speaking of Jeffords, maybe your daughters would like to know that their daddy throws away all their drawings?
They just draw so many, and they're all so bad.
And you, Santiago, maybe the world would like to see that draft of a memo you wrote where you used T-H-E-I-R instead of T-H-E-R-E?
Oh, you sick son of a bitch.
Why do you hate us so much?
I know you call me Mean Marge.
Do you even know my last name?
Hmm?
- Mop-Bucket?
- Scully, don't guess.
- Please.
- No.
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
"Mop-Bucket," Scully?
It was a educated guess.
Thanks for coming.
Pimento put the duffel in his trunk, parked around the corner, and went home; he's been doing shirtless tai chi in his window ever since.
Which window is that?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
Look, I got to get into that trunk.
And you need me to break into the car for you?
What?
No, I can do it.
Why would you say that?
Because one time you lost your keys and you called a tow truck.
My mom pays for roadside assistance.
Why wouldn't I call it?
I'm doing this.
Okay, great take!
You guys are finally getting it.
All right, let's go again.
Action Holt!
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.
I'm Captain Raymond Holt.
And I'm Detective Rosa Diaz.
Hee-yah.
The hell is this?
You had a pizzazz problem, so you've been recast, sweetie.
Welcome to Hollywood.
You know, David here really connected with the role.
The key is to invent a backstory for your character.
Now, my Raymond Holt is addicted to pills, but no one knows.
You see, he really understands the craft, whereas you and Rosa just sort of flop around like a couple of boring normals.
I'm sorry, but we're detectives, not professional actors.
We were trying our hardest.
- "We were trying our hardest".
- Stop it.
Gina, this is a disgrace.
I'm removing you as director.
There he goes.
Off to take more pills.
Oh, yeah.
Suck it, roadside assistance.
Well, well, well.
Hello, Jake.
Adrian, what a coincidence bumping into you here.
Well, see you tomorrow.
You know what, let's hang out now.
I was thinking the exact same thing.
What are you doing here, partner?
Pimento's still in the windo.
Come on, Jake.
You honestly didn't assume I would hire a look-alike to wear a fake beard and do tai chi in my window?
No, I definitely didn't assume that.
And plus, you seriously thought that was me?
I mean, you've seen me in my underpants.
My butt is rock hard.
That guy's got a pancake butt.
I can't believe you're still working for Figgis.
That's why you've been acting so weird.
Breaking into my apartment, buying a burner phone, grabbing this duffel.
I broke into your apartment 'cause I didn't feel safe - at my home.
- Okay.
And a burner phone is the only kind of phone I can get because I disappeared for 12 years, - and now have terrible credit.
- Makes sense.
You want to know what's in the duffel?
Open it up, tough guy.
Oh, look at that.
A bunch of old family photos and personal belongings.
Pimento's mementos.
I know you have a gun on me.
I just couldn't resist the rhyme, sorry.
I stashed it all when I became Paul Sneed.
I couldn't have them finding anything that could trace back to my family.
I get it, all right?
I went through the exact same thing when I came back You have no clue what I've been through!
You know what?
I can't believe I trusted you.
Okay.
Just get out of here, Jake.
Oh, my God, this guy's got a pancake butt.
It's not Pimento.
Get out of there, Jake!
Thanks, Rosa.
So Detective Pimento didn't show up for work today.
Any idea why?
Oh, yeah, I straight up drove him off.
Big screw-up on my part.
I'm trying this new thing where I just own my mistakes.
- I like it.
Do you?
- I did.
- Until you bragged about it.
- Yeah.
Pimento left his gun and badge on my desk, along with a note reading, "I can't do this.
I'm better off as a bagman".
Oh, no.
You think he went back to work with Figgis?
Worse.
Fine, single bag it.
It's your funeral, you dumb son of a bitch.
Get out of here.
Idiot.
Hey, partner.
Bag boys don't have partners.
Actually, cashiers and bag boys need to be totally in sync Shut up, Maggie.
Look, man, you sacrificed 12 years of your life for the police department; you're a hero.
I'm sorry that I didn't trust you.
Yeah.
Me too.
Look, can I tell you something I've never told anyone before?
My time undercover in the Mafia was actually kind of lame.
I mean, I wanted it to be badass, but I'm good at computers, so I mostly just helped them switch over from AOL.
I have no idea what you're going through.
And I want to tell you that it's all gonna go back to normal, but honestly, I have no clue.
Anyways, the footage came back on that B&E, and we've got a suspect.
I'm going to bust him right now if you want to come with me.
Why don't you give me those eggs?
I'll put them on top here.
Okay.
What was that about?
What happened to you?
Maggie, butt out!
Okay?
This is my life!
So I just received word from our friend at the Guffin Foundation.
Apparently they loved our video submission.
What did you send them?
A cinematic masterpiece is what I sent them.
Did it feature pizzazz?
No, none at all, sir.
First, I couldn't wrap my head around that concept, but then I realized: do you know which dogs get the most likes on the internet?
Anatolian Shepherds.
No, ugly little runts with wonky eyes and tongues that won't stay in their mouths.
But the Anatolian Shepherd is unrivaled for protecting livestock.
I was trying to wow them, and I should have just been showcasing our wonk-eye.
I will remember you We were trying our hardest, but this is a disgrace.
Disgrace, disgrace.
Help us.
Stop it.
And that's real audio of your very-real diva meltdown.
You might just make it as an actor after all.
Well done, Linetti.
Sergeant Linetti.
I had the fake Holt give me a promotion.
He signed the papers and everything.
What do you want?
To tell you that we will officially be renaming the fourth-floor break room "The Marge Bronigan Break Room".
Well.
Looks like somebody did their homework.
It was me.
I did it.
So what's the catch?
The ceremony starts in two hours.
Now, I know our squad is not in the janitor's union, but it'd sure be nice if we were allowed to clean the place up before then.
We cleaned up the stew, which means the Marge Bronigan Break Room is open for business!
Okay, we'll take out your trash, do normal cleaning, but no big messes.
Great!
Time for the christening.
Oh, crap.
Congratulations.
Perp is on the third floor.
Everyone know your assignment?
Mind if I tag along?
Pimento?
I thought about it.
If you say things will get back to normal, then I trust you.
All right.
Let's do this.
You're with me, partner.
NYPD!
You're under arrest!
You're gonna die!
No, Pimento!
No!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
1 Attention, everyone!
Say good-bye to the Jake Peralta you know and love, for today is the day I forever change.
Ooh, are you finally growing a mustache?
No, you know I can't do that, and it's cruel of you to keep bringing it up.
This envelope contains the inheritance my uncle left me.
He died a year ago; he was so rich, he had a whole room in his house just to eat in.
You mean like a dining room?
- Yeah, but in Manhattan.
- Oh, dang.
Now, just because I'm definitely rich now doesn't mean I'm gonna forget my roots.
You all get something, so fire away.
Jake, your friendship is gift enough for me.
Friendship is crap.
I want a Ducati Monster 821.
All right, Rosa gets a motorcycle.
Oh, cool.
I want a fast sports car.
Come on.
You can be honest.
I want old, expensive books.
I'll send you a list.
There you go.
Now, let's find out what I'm worth.
Oh, I'm too nervous to open it.
Sarge, you do it.
Okay.
It's stock.
One million shares!
Oh, my God!
Of Blockbuster Video stock.
- All: Ohh.
- What?
Is that bad?
I still have a Blockbuster card!
What happened to Blockbuster?
Mapping, mapping, mapping, mapping, mapping, mapping.
What's going on there, buddy?
Just making a final imprint of your face before the LASIK surgery goes poorly and my eyeballs get burned off.
Why stop at the eyes?
Burn off your whole head.
Charles, the surgery is going to go fine, all right?
You'll have some vision impairment for a few hours, and I'm gonna be with you the whole time!
Plus, they're gonna give you some of those sweet-ass Robocop sunglasses.
Those are blind people sunglasses.
Captain.
What are you doing here?
Thought you took the day off to pack for your big trip, or did you finally realize that it only takes one minute to pack?
Not if you care about your possessions and what the world sees when they look at you.
- Huh.
- I'm not going.
Cheddar's regular dog sitter is ill, and the heat's out in my house, so I don't think it's a good time for me to visit Kevin in Paris.
Sir, you can't just cancel your trip.
You guys haven't seen each other in months.
How about this: Amy and I will look after your house while you're gone.
- Right, Ames?
- Totally.
I thought you two were watching Ray Charles Boyle.
Good point.
Charles can come with us and look after Cheddar.
I'm told that blind people have a special connection with dogs.
I knew it.
You do think I'm gonna go blind.
That's an interesting offer, but I don't want to be an imposition.
Pshaw!
Imposition?
Pshaw!
No, I was talking to Santiago.
I assume she'll be doing all the work.
Why?
Oh, because of our track records and personalities.
Sure, sure, sure, sure, yeah.
So, Santiago, are you sure you're okay with this?
I'm so in.
This is gonna be fantastic.
This is horrible!
We're not ready for this.
This is a level one responsibility.
I'm a level two at best, and you're not even a level!
Well, I'm a level, you know.
I'm probably, like, a level five.
Not a level.
I thought you'd be psyched.
I mean, a week at Captain Holt's house?
Wasn't that where you wanted to spend your honeymoon?
Yeah, but this is too much pressure!
Why did you volunteer us for this?
Because Holt hasn't seen Kevin in, like, months, and I was just thinking if that was me and you, it would make me really sad.
Oh.
That's actually super sweet.
Plus, therthis big, fat binder full of instructions and rules.
There's a binder?
Why didn't you lead with that, you idiot?
Oh!
How about I just leave you two alone?
Okay.
Diaz.
Pimento.
- What's up?
- What's up with you?
- I need you to sign this report.
- Okay.
I'll sign your report.
Mm.
What the hell?
Mm.
Careful.
The ink's still wet.
Maybe this'll help.
Okay, they got to knock that off.
- Loosen up, Sarge.
- Summer of love, baby.
It's March, man.
Shut up.
It's true what they say.
Now that I'm fully blind forever, my other senses are heightened.
I feel a door.
We're at Captain Holt's house.
Also, the GPS announced it when we pulled up.
Hey, once we're inside, maybe keep your hands to yourself, all right?
The captain can be very particular about his stuff.
Cheddar!
Let go!
Let go of it!
- Amy?
- This is a cashmere sweater!
Oh, my stupid allergies!
He got into Kevin's closet.
He was supposed to stay downstairs.
The binder was very clear about that.
Why won't you respect the binder?
Oh, no, he's turning all the turtlenecks into regular necks.
- Charles, you got to help us.
- On it.
Okay, the key with dogs is establishing the alpha.
Cheddah, dwop it.
Pwease dwop it.
I'll give you anything you want.
Oh, Cheddar is the alpha.
Didn't expect that.
Pwease, pwease, pwease.
Nice job, Boyle.
It worked.
But the mess, Jake.
The mess!
Don't worry.
We're gonna clean it up.
Everything is totally under control.
- Charles' pants are on fire.
- What?
Boyle, the space heater!
Get away from the space heater!
I don't know where it is!
I'm just gonna run at full speed!
- No!
- Aah!
Charles, just stay where you are!
I got it.
Whoo!
Okay.
It's okay.
Everything's fine.
Fire's out.
And this table is Oh!
Fragile.
I was gonna say fragile.
- Nailed it.
- Ah!
You punching holes?
- Yeah.
- That's way too much paper.
Not for me.
Can't even get a cup of coffee.
Well, I'm off to find some yellow paper so I can do this all over again.
All right, Diaz?
That's it.
What's going on with you two?
- Oh, you noticed it?
- Yeah, I noticed it!
Everyone's noticed it!
A convicted pervert asked me if you guys could cool it.
I don't know what to tell you.
Something between us, Sarge.
Something dark and urgent.
Ah.
Okay.
Great news.
The smell of burnt sweatpants and singed leg hair is finally dissipating.
I just hope I can grow it back by Speedo season.
Call from Raymond Holt, mobile.
Oh, no.
Not Holt.
Don't worry.
I've got this.
Bonjour, Captain.
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
No, I don't want to sleep with you.
Is that what that means?
Oh, man, I had a really gross tennis instructor.
I'm calling to check in before I get on the flight.
- Everything okay?
-  Okay?
Let's just say if the house could talk, she would say, "I've never been happier; I love Jake".
Oh, that's interesting, because I think the house might say "Jake's a liar, and I'm on fire".
What's that now?
The security company called me about the alarm.
Okay, the house was never on fire.
Charles was on fire, and only on his pants, and we put it out.
I'm coming home right now.
Wait, no.
Sir, please don't do that.
You have to go see Kevin.
Everything's fine.
No, my decision is final.
I'm postponing my flight.
Good-bye, Jacob.
No, sir!
Please, please ahh!
He said "Jacob".
It's biblical.
Guys, guys!
Holt is headed home right now.
No!
He can't come home.
We left the door open, and the dog ran out.
What?
We lost Cheddar?
These silences are very hard for me to read.
- What's the vibe in here?
- We're freaking out, Charles!
Good afternoon.
Thank you all for joining me.
What we have here is a fugitive situation.
Our man has been on the run for 30 minutes.
Also, our man is a dog.
Now, I know what some of you are thinking: "Who cares?
It's just a pet".
No one was thinking that, you monster.
Good.
That was a test.
Now, the average foot speed of a corgi is ten miles per hour, which means with every passing second, that slippery bastard gets farther away.
Captain Holt does not know Cheddar is missing but he's gonna find out.
Oh, God, I feel like the devil is dancing on my chest.
It's all right, Amy.
We have time.
Gina's picking Holt up at the airport, and she told me she can stall him for at least two hours.
I'll do it, but I'm gonna have to total your car.
Or you could just drive slowly.
Ha-ha, she's gonna wreck your car.
Here's where we're at.
Amy and I will take Blind Charles and search the neighborhood.
Diaz, Pimento Bring the dog back, dead or alive.
What?
No.
I was gonna say hang posters.
Terry, maybe go with them, make sure nobody gets killed.
Or maybe I could join another group with a different kind of energy?
Jake, what about me and Hitchcock?
You two grab Cheddar's treats and put 'em in a bowl outside.
You mean the little sausage ones that need way more salt?
On second thought, maybe just sit exactly where you are and don't touch anything.
Sweet.
All right, everyone, it's time to do this.
For Captain Holt, for Kevin, for America!
Let's go, Nine-Nine!
This line is interminable.
At this rate, we'll be home in 54 minutes instead of the usual 46.
Not if I have anything to do with it.
Watch me now!
No, Gina, the wrong way.
No, Gina, the spikes!
Uh-oh.
Well, not a problem.
I can get you home on two wheels.
And that was the second pair of tires.
Mm.
I could've done that.
Yeah, I know you could've.
But you didn't.
I did.
I mean, there are lots of other poles, guys.
A whole street full of 'em.
So, Adrian, when are we gonna stop messing around and do this thing?
Um - N-never.
- What?
You know what?
I just realized.
I forgot something at home.
I'm just gonna That was weird.
You okay?
Yes.
All right, according to the call we just got on the tip line, someone said they saw Cheddar on this block.
I'll head north.
Jake, you head west.
We'll meet back in a half hour.
Great, which direction should I go?
What's going on?
I can hear your lips moving.
Ah!
Are you guys kissing?
What?
No.
Charles, stop always asking that.
Look, I'm sorry, but you have to stay in the car.
That's a mistake!
My super senses are a tool you can't afford to leave in the tool chest.
Take me out of the box and put me on your belt.
I'm sorry, but you'd only slow us down.
And that's exactly what Cheddar wants.
That's right.
I'm onto you, you slippery little bastard.
Gina, come on.
You can do your Internet socializing in the truck.
Okay, cool, I just have to tie my shoe real quick.
Tying it.
Call Jake Peralta.
Gina, hey, how's the stalling?
Great; the tow truck just got here, so that'll buy us at least an hour.
Tow truck?
What the hell did you do to my car?
Bitch, I told you I was gonna wreck it.
You did.
You did.
All right, well, we're about to go follow up on a lead right now.
Great; I'm gonna rip a bunch of wires out of your dashboard.
What?
No, don't!
Gina Gah!
I got nothing.
Did you find Cheddar?
Close.
I found Shredder.
Shredder, no!
No, Shredder!
You're not Cheddar!
I know it looks bad, but we're gonna find him.
Right after we find Charles.
Charles is gone.
We lost Charles.
- What?
- Charles?
Charles!
Here, boy!
Here, boy!
Oh, I should've known I was gonna lose Charles.
He's so pocket-sized.
He could be hidden anywhere!
Jake, we need to focus on Cheddar.
Charles is a grown man.
He can take care of himself.
No, he's not.
He's a Charles, all right?
And he's blind!
Oh, God, he's probably already dead.
Right?
So let's not waste any resources on him.
-  - Wait, it's Charles.
- Charles?
- Jake?
Is that you?
I can't see my phone.
I've dialed over 40 wrong numbers.
- It's me.
- I found Cheddar.
He found Cheddar!
Which is why I was like, "We need to go to him".
Charles, where are you?
I've got him cornered in some bushes, but I don't know where I am, and my -  - Wait, stop talking.
I'm hearing something in the background.
What is that, a train and a girl whimpering?
That's me; I'm so scared you're not gonna find me.
Charles, don't move.
I know exactly where you are.
He's at the entrance by 7th Street.
I used to hang out there all the time.
Doing what?
Aw!
I boofed it.
Nothing.
Cool stuff.
Having sex.
Anyways, it doesn't matter.
Let's go.
- Aah!
- Hey, Sarge.
- I've been waiting for you.
- In here?
Yeah, I wanted to have a private conversation.
Do you think Diaz noticed that I freaked out a little when she asked me out?
You mean the way your eyes popped out of your head and you sprinted away at full speed?
- Yeah, I think she noticed.
- Damn it.
I'm in kind of a weird head space right now.
I've got a lot on my plate, emotionally speaking.
And flirting's one thing, but a relationship?
Well The last time I let myself fall for someone was Katya.
She was a bartender at the Garbage Box, second-rate strip club my mob buddies and I used to go to.
She was a sweet girl, but I couldn't save her from the pole.
- Oh, she started stripping?
- Nope.
Boss impaled her on a pole when he caught her skimming tips.
Ooh!
Damn, dude.
Look, coming back from 12 years undercover is not easy for anyone.
I'm sure Diaz gets it.
She's so in touch with her feelings.
And me, hmm.
After what I've seen, after what I've done, I don't know that I deserve to be happy.
Of course you do.
Huh.
I never looked at it that way.
Wow.
That changes everything.
Ha!
I never even finished my point.
No, Sarge, you said it all.
You just changed my life.
He's got to be here somewhere.
What's up, Peralta?
Want to jump in on this tasty sesh?
Uh, you got the wrong guy.
I've never seen you before.
Heh, dumb stoner.
- He referred to you by name.
- Hey, there's Charles.
- Jake?
Jake?
- Charles, we're behind you.
Look!
I found Cheddar.
- I found him.
- Oh, God.
I know.
Pretty impressive, right?
It's a proud day for blind people everywhere.
- Charles - It wasn't easy, though.
This guy put up quite a fight.
But we're good friends now, right?
Right?
You gave me a bunch of kisses.
You gave me a bunch of kisses.
Damn it, Charles, it's a possum.
Oh, no.
Mercifully, the tires have been replaced, so may I please have the keys?
Okay, but before we go, can we just choose a nice air freshener from the gift shop?
You never know when you're gonna find your signature scent.
I'm not an idiot, Gina; I know for a fact you've already found your signature scent.
Ugh!
I have got to stop living my life out loud.
I've had a hell of a day.
I've got a lot going on in my life, more than Peralta ruining my house, so can we please drop the charade so I can get home already?
Absolutely, sir.
Wait, I should tell you.
Before you got real with me I did rip out all these wires.
All right, everyone, listen up.
Here's where we're at.
Bad news: Cheddar is still at large, and you know that slippery little bastard is just laughing at us.
We need a new plan, and we need it now.
Because the walls are closing in and I can't breathe.
Come on, guys, we're just spitballing.
There's no stupid ideas.
What if we walk around the neighborhood in Captain Holt's clothes, wait till Cheddar picks up the smell?
No, that's insane, never gonna happen.
- Anyone else?
- You guys go off the grid.
I'm listening.
Go on.
I get you guys Mexican passports.
Totally untraceable.
We fake your death in an apartment fire.
I'll need three teeth from both of you.
Then you guys just disappear.
It's easy.
I've done it before.
Oh, have you?
Because you haven't mentioned it 500 times.
- Get a new thing.
- Okay.
Amazingly, wearing Holt's clothes is our best option.
Everyone, prepare to enter high society.
Okay, how's everybody feeling?
Anyone else have the weird urge to lecture themselves?
"Peralta, what are you doing"?
Peralta, what are you doing?
I conjured him.
Captain Holt!
What a pleasant surprise.
Gina told me that you were delayed due to a wire situation.
Yes, the situation is, you can rip them all out but the car still works.
Sorry, boo.
Wait, why is the whole squad here?
And why is everyone wearing my clothes?
My God.
You lost Cheddar.
How did you do that?
Sir, I know you're upset, but I promise you we can find Cheddar and you can still go to Paris.
I'm not going to Paris.
Now, get out of my clothes.
Get into your clothes.
Get out of my house.
Get into your cars All right, we can take it from there.
Loud and clear.
Once again, so sorry.
Oh, he's so disappointed.
Look, I'm sorry that I got you involved in this.
I never should have volunteered us.
No, Jake.
It's not your fault.
- It's Amy's.
- What?
Well, it's not my fault.
- Blind.
- Ugh.
And Jake's not the one who let Cheddar go to town on Kevin's sweaters.
Please, it's not like I fed him Kevin's sweaters.
Wait a minute, guys.
I think this is Kevin's fault.
No, Jake, it's Amy's.
I know you're trying to be a cool boyfriend yet another reason why it's not your fault but Kevin's in Paris.
Exactly, and that's why I think it's Kevin's fault.
I have an idea of how to find Cheddar.
Amy, don't act weird when I say this, but we're gonna need to use the binder.
Oh, Mama.
Diaz!
- Could we talk?
- What do you want, Pimento?
Listen, Sarge gave me some really great advice.
So, Rosa Diaz, will you marry me?
Both: What?
This is what you told me to do!
I barely said anything!
You cut me off way too early.
Sarge, stay out of this.
Gladly.
No, I will not marry you.
How about we just get a drink first?
Yeah.
Yeah, that sounds nice.
Oh, that's actually sweet.
Nope.
Oh, there he is.
Captain Holt!
Oh, he can't hear me.
Eh  Okay, well, I guess we know what those wires did.
I'm not in the mood for your antics, Peralta.
Sir, sir!
I think we know where Cheddar is.
Will you please just get in the car?
Oh, let me get that.
Try now.
Oh, I can't control the locks.
Hang on.
Try now.
One, two, three.
Try now.
Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!
Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!
Try now.
Try now.
Try now.
Here we come, Cheddar!
Try now.
Cheddar!
Come here, baby.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
How did you know he was here?
Well, Cheddar was only chewing up Kevin's stuff.
I figured maybe he was acting out because he missed Kevin.
But the real hero here is the binder.
Under "Cheddar," subsection "Walk," subsection "Walks with Kevin," we found this special spot.
So you're missing Kevin, huh?
You're not the only one.
I didn't cancel my trip because I was worried you would burn my house down.
Kevin and I are having a hard time right now.
Whenever we talk, we fight.
And I'm just afraid and just just afraid that if I go to Paris and we fight, then Sir, with all due respect, that's crazy.
I mean, you and Kevin are the best couple I know.
And I'm sure whatever this is, you can get through it, because you are the strongest person I know.
Wow, that was weird; I said, like, multiple real things consecutively, yeah.
Felt weird but good.
Are you proud of me?
- You're ruining it.
- Yup.
I'm just gonna stop talking now.
Well, I suppose I'm not gonna solve anything by running away from it.
Perhaps I should go to Paris.
What do you think, Cheddar?
Huh?
Oh, my, oh!
You really are acting out!
Whew!
I'm sorry you had to see that.
Oh.
You know, it's moments like these that I'm grateful for your  Guys, it's a miracle!
I can see!
- Not now, Charles!
- Shut up!
Right, sorry!
Sorry.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
1 Bonjour, mes amis.
Oh, someone had a good time in Paris.
Oh, Kevin and I shared a perfect week together.
I feel like I'm floating on a croissant.
I wonder why people don't just break into song more often.
I've been asking you for months if I could answer the phone like, Who dis?
Give it a whirl, girl.
Guys, he's rhyming.
He's telling Gina to sing.
Captain Holt is on a vacation high!
He will say yes to anything right now.
I would like a police horse, and I'd like Terry to be riding it almost constantly.
I'd like an HR person to remind everyone about workplace boundaries.
The Japanese make toilet seats which squirt a heated jet of water right up your I'm gonna stop you right there, bud.
What we need in here is an armored personnel carrier a tank!
Two tanks.
I want a tank too.
Great, so everyone gets a tank.
Just remember we can't ruin Captain Holt's vacation high, so no one say anything that'll upset him.
Oh, no, what are those morons doing in there?
Maybe it's not that bad; maybe they didn't upset him.
What'd you do?
What'd you say?
Nothing.
We just said, "Welcome back".
And laughed with him about all the weight he gained in France.
-  - No!
Why is everyone just standing around?
Get back to work!
So long, tank.
Tank?
I gained three pounds in Paris three pounds!
Hey, Terry, I have a package for you.
Ooh, Sarge got a present.
"What's in the box"?
Brad Pitt, "Se7en".
But seriously, what's in the box?
The worst thing in the world.
Shut up, stupid.
Okay, so who sent you a kitten and why do you hate it?
It's not a kitten.
It's a slap in the face for something that happened 20 years ago.
When you had a flat top?
I know you had a flat top, 'cause I saw pictures.
Sorry, go on with your story, Flat Top Terry.
It was 1995.
I'd just made detective.
I was really excited about my first day at the 6-5, but the guys in the squad were a bunch of jerks.
Hi, I'm Terry.
Which desk is mine?
Solve a case, then you get a desk.
They were like that about a lot of stuff.
Whoa, solve a case, then you get coffee.
Solve a case, then you can sign Debbie's birthday card.
Sounds like you needed to solve a case.
Exactly, so I picked the biggest one I could find: a string of B&Es, all with the same M.O. Guy climbed in through high-rise windows.
After a month, I found my suspect: Dmitri Kuzkho.
Ex-acrobat with a criminal record.
Circus trash!
It has to be him.
That's exactly what I said.
Circus trash!
It has to be him.
I tracked down my acrobat, got SWAT to surround his building.
There was no way anything could go wrong.
NYPD!
Down!
Get on the ground!
Let's see your hands!
Uh-oh.
My guy had a terrible trapeze fall two years prior snapped his spine in half.
So why the kitten?
Well, in the moment, I may have gotten a little flustered.
Look, he's got a cat!
He trained the cat to do the robberies!
That's why they call them cat burglars!
Why is no one saying anything?
Oh, Terry.
Yeah, now they send me cats to remind me of that day and rub it in my face.
I'm gonna go put a ad online so I can find someone to adopt this evil, little turd.
Counterpoint: you two make an adorable couple.
Might I suggest putting him in a mug and pretending to take a sip?
Terry, are you stomping off to do my thing?
Oh, hey, can I borrow that?
Genevieve's out of town.
I need two phones so I can send her a "frontie" and a "backie".
I don't want your ass in my cloud.
Adrian, are you living in the break room?
No, why do you ask?
Uh, because you're shaving your shoulder in our communal eating space; you have a bed set up on the couch; stuff like that.
Fine.
Busted.
My landlord kicked me out because my stupid neighbors couldn't handle a few tiny night screams.
I was dreaming that someone was trying to scalp me with a sharpened grapefruit spoon.
Aren't brains fascinating?
I mean, where does it come up with this stuff?
When I was undercover, someone did try and scalp me with a sharpened grapefruit spoon.
Sure, that would do it.
Aren't you dating Rosa?
Can't you just stay with her?
Oh, yeah, no, we're doing this really hot thing where we haven't told each other where we live.
Makes our sex play really erotic.
- Barf.
- I totally get that.
Well, you let me know if there's anything I can do.
Oh, yes, I will stay at your home.
Thank you.
Me?
What how now?
You just said you wanted to help.
Oh, unless you weren't being serious, which I would get.
I've been betrayed before.
For instance, by the grapefruit spoon guy.
No, no, no, no, definitely.
You could stay with me.
Oh!
You're the best, Chuck!
Thank you!
But for real, get yourself some good ear plugs, because I really downplayed how horrible those night screams are.
Ah.
All right, I'll see you later, roomie.
All right.
Attention: the 9-9 will be hosting a bomb-defusing class tomorrow.
I highly recommend attending.
Defusing an explosive device is the ultimate test of skill under pressure.
And the stakes: life or death.
- Will lunch be provided?
- Yes.
Count us in.
Anyone else?
- I'm in.
- Me too.
This class sounds like "da bomb".
I'd rather you didn't attend if you're not gonna take it seriously.
- Yup.
- Dismissed.
I'm gonna dominate that class.
You don't cross-stitch for 20 years without developing a steady hand.
Wow, you really think that's a brag, don't you?
20 bucks says I do better in that class than you do, thread-head.
All right, you're on.
And I'll have you know that "thread-head" is a glowing compliment in the sewing community.
If you wanted to insult me, you should've called me a stitch skipper.
- Okay, stitch skipper.
- Oh, I handed it to you!
You better look cute in this picture, or no one's gonna want you.
Do something with your damn paws!
Whoa, whoa, Sarge, relax.
Look, I think you might be overreacting a little to this prank, and I should know.
You probably won't believe this, but I was bullied in high school for being too handsome.
- I don't believe you.
- You're right.
It was for setting my crotch on fire in shop class.
Hurt like the dickens.
Point is, haters gonna hate.
Shake it off.
Taylor Swift, always right.
The reason bullies get to me is because I lived with one my dad.
He was a cruel man who didn't like his life, and he took it out on me.
Okay, okay.
Now we're getting somewhere.
If you're having dad problems, that's my jam, son.
Real weird take on my crappy father.
You know how I turned the corner with my dad?
I stood up to him, and that's what you need to do with your dad.
No, he died in 1988.
Oh, okay, well, that probably won't work, then.
But it doesn't mean you can't go over to the 6-5 and stand up to those bullies.
They'll just make fun of me more.
What are you talking about, Terry?
You are a human mountain.
You have more muscles in your ears than I have in my entire body.
Never skip ear day, Jake.
You can crush metal with your bare hands.
You can lift a city bus.
You can make your boobies do that bouncy thing.
- They're called pecs.
- Same thing.
Now, get on over to the 6-5 and make those big jerks take back that tiny kitten.
Yeah.
All right.
I'm doing it.
Didn't work.
I have more kittens than before.
What?
How?
Morning, Sarge.
Oh, good morning, my sweet, little cuties.
Don't call them cute.
They'd kill us all if they were smart enough to use weapons, but you're not smart.
You're dumb.
You're always naked, and you pee in a box.
I suppose they're not totally naked with the fur.
Anyways, you know how you didn't solve that case 20 years ago?
Thanks for reminding me.
You don't see me bringing up how you burned your junk off.
That didn't happen.
There was just some light blistering.
The point is, the only thing those bullies have over you is that you never solved that case.
So why don't we solve it together?
How are we gonna do that?
We'll sneak into the 6-5, steal that old case file, and work it till we find your burglar.
Then we march back into that precinct And we grind these kittens up and shove them down their throats!
Yes!
Don't listen to him.
You're a part of something much bigger than yourselves.
Well, good morning, Linetti.
Whoo, I slept like a frickin' baby last night.
Staying at Chuck's is like a dream.
Little guy loves doting on me, although you're gonna need to buy some bigger underwear if we're gonna be sharing, you know what I mean?
Okay, I'll get right on that.
Okay, cool.
Here.
Take care of this for me, will you?
Yeah.
I'm gonna go get some breakfast candy.
Okay, catch you later.
So things are going really good with the new roomie, it seems.
It's horrible.
There's someone's blood all over the bathroom.
He sleep-choked me twice.
And the worst part this morning, he ate all of my cereal.
That's the worst part?
They were Nortfluskers bran circles!
I had them shipped from Oslo.
Oh, I want him out.
But I'm too scared to tell him.
All right, listen.
I know that your spirit animal is a caterpillar that's been stepped on - Mm-hmm.
- But mine is the mighty wolf.
And if you want to beat an alpha, you have to be an alpha.
Wrongo.
If you're good enough at being a beta, then the alpha takes mercy on you and ends up giving you what you want.
- Boyle.
- Argh!
Could you stay out of your kitchen for the next, like, 48 hours?
I'm gonna be skinning a deer than I shot.
What?
Ooh, and put up some of those plastic sheets.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
- Okay.
- Okay, great.
- Good talk, buddy.
- Yup.
I got the file.
Oh, nice work.
How'd you do it?
Well the sergeant in charge of the file room was a lady, so I just turned on the old Peralta charm.
Hey, there.
Some dude yarfed in the men's restroom.
Could you please find somebody to clean that up?
Terry, there was no yarf.
Yeah, I figured that.
Oh, okay.
Let's see what we got here.
40 photos of you standing next to the guy in the wheelchair and his cat.
They did a photoshoot.
They made mouse pads.
They are bad dudes.
All right, here's our plan.
We are gonna re-interview all the original victims of this case, starting with the first one, Janice McMinnion.
Uh, she died 12 years ago.
- All right, the second one.
- Also dead.
Okay, why don't you just skip on down to the first person that's not dead.
Number eight.
Number eight, way to stay alive.
Number eight, still alive Both: Number eight, still alive Moment of silence for the first seven, though.
All right, let's go!
Ah, pressure bombs with mercury switches.
IEDs with cell phone detonators.
Oh, is that C4?
Oh, my, we've got some great bombs today, people.
Welcome.
In this course, we'll be going over how to dispose of 10 different types of explosive devices.
What you learn today could save your lives and countless others.
- Any questions?
- Yes.
Will there be a grading or point system to see who's best?
At saving lives.
Yes, at saving lives.
Saving lives was always implied.
Well, you will be timed.
- Perfect.
- That'll do.
But I would recommend ignoring the clock and focusing on Yeah, yeah, yeah, you answered the question.
Hurry up and teach us.
Hey, Slowpoke.
When we get out of here, I'm gonna needlepoint you a pillow that says, "Kapow".
Hey, Amy.
You suck.
Oh, yeah?
Well, guess what?
There's more room on that pillow Real quick, before you finish: you still suck.
Argh!
I'm working so much harder than you on this trash talk, and I'm the one whose feelings are getting hurt.
Santiago, Diaz enough.
This is not about who's fastest.
This is a bomb dismantling class.
We are police officers, not street urchins playing speed chess in the park.
For shame.
All right, thanks.
Okay, here's what Esther remembers about the night that she was robbed.
She was either at a restaurant or the movies or doing something else.
And she was either alone or with people.
The only thing she was absolutely sure of is that I seem like a very nice boy, which is not relevant to the case, but did make me feel very good.
This is stupid.
It was 20 years ago.
No one remembers anything.
I'm beginning to think maybe we should Climb out on that ledge and see how the perp got in.
- I was gonna say give up.
- What?
Right after I came up with that incredible ledge thing, Terry?
We're 10 stories up.
You can handle that?
Sarge, I'm not scared of heights, okay?
I'm scared of bees, I'm scared of snakes, and I'm scared that the Knicks might never be good again, but I am not scared of heights.
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
I would appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about my window ledge freak-out.
That's not as embarrassing as thinking we could actually solve a 20-year-old case with no new leads.
Terry, we are gonna solve this, all right?
Sure, maybe none of the work we did today led to any new information.
Jake And sure, most crimes are solved within the first 48 hours, but they never talk about the crimes that are solved within the first 100 million hours.
No, look at this.
The guy who inspected this elevator in 1996 was named Zerb Gudanya.
That's the same weird name who inspected the elevators in all four of the buildings we've been to today.
Really?
Terry, that's a lead.
We have a lead!
We got a lead!
We got a lead!
We're gonna solve this case.
We're gonna solve this case.
I have to use the bathroom.
I got to use the bathroom.
I actually don't; I just got in the rhythm of it.
There's Zerb Gudanya.
Pretty fancy car for an elevator inspector.
The Club International of Brighton Beach International Club?
"International" and "club" are both in the name twice.
Terry, this place sleazy.
Two priors, wealth beyond his means, and he had access to the apartments through the elevator shaft.
He has to be our guy.
Let's go.
Okay, I'll say that I'm a businessman from Moscow named Ilya.
"I make millions from selling snow boots".
That was more just to show off the accent.
I'm not wedded to the snow boots thing.
Hey, fellas.
You didn't really think that you could run an operation in the 6-5 without us finding out, did you?
There was no yarf.
This guy's good.
Jake, this is Holderton from my old precinct.
So who are you guys looking for in there?
A Tabby?
Siamese?
First of all, I never said the cat was a burglar.
I said he might be an accomplice.
You know what?
I hope the guy in there is a cat.
That'll show you.
Yeah, if he was a cat, he'd be much easier to apprehend and probably much less dangerous.
That's what we think.
Let's go.
Okay, I give up.
I need your help.
I'm ready to try it your way.
Shh, you came at the perfect time.
He's eating, and when an animal eats, that's when they're at their most vulnerable.
You need to get in there show him who the alpha is.
- I need a wolf name.
- Yes.
- Virginia Woolf.
- Huh?
Well, I'm not gonna be her lame husband, Leonard.
Okay, it's time, Virginia.
Hey, little man, let's talk about how much longer you're gonna stay at my place.
Are you threatening me, Chuck?
No, I'm not, sir.
I just want to tell you how welcome you are to stay with me forever and ever and ever, m'lord.
Ha!
Okay.
Good, thanks.
Next time don't be so weird about it.
As you wish.
Good day, sir.
That's still weird.
All right, sorry.
You don't suck.
I'm sorry too.
We both said hurtful things.
You didn't.
I was fine.
Well, now you're just lying to yourself.
But Holt was right.
We should have taken this more seriously.
Done.
Fastest time today by a full two minutes.
Whoo, mama!
Is everything okay over here?
Yes, couldn't be better, because I destroyed you both.
What the hell?
I thought you said this wasn't about winning.
I did say that, so you would go slower and I would win, which is what happened.
You're just as competitive as we are.
Absurd.
I'm more competitive.
Now who's "da bomb"?
So what did they make you a sergeant for?
Did you arrest a pine cone?
He passed a written test, just like every other sergeant did.
You knew that.
Oh, no, I thought he might have gotten some kind of special promotion from busting a pine cone.
Why do you keep bringing up pine cones?
That's never been a part of this.
You know what?
You're gonna eat your words, because Sarge is about to solve this case.
What, the old case or the pine cone one?
You need to stop.
Look, our man Zerb is sitting right over there, and yeah, he's connected to all of the robberies.
And he's shady as hell.
Look.
Waiter just gave him a covert signal.
Now he's getting up.
Yeah, and now he's following said waiter to a secondary, most likely even shadier spot.
Something's going on in there.
- Huh.
- Yeah, right huh!
- Come on, let's go bust him!
- Come on.
Down, down!
Get down!
NYPD!
Uh-oh.
What are you doing, man?
Nothing!
I have high cholesterol!
My wife says I cannot have red meat, so they sneak in my beef stew.
Please don't shoot.
Oh, my God.
It happened again.
Only this guy's sitting on a toilet instead of a wheelchair.
That's even more dumb.
Here, here, Terry.
Move in closer so I can get you in the photo.
What up, Jake?
Why are these dicks out of their cage?
I stayed up all night working on your case, and Hans, John, and Nakatomi made for great company.
I gave them all "Die Hard" names.
I don't understand why you wasted another night on a case no one's ever gonna solve.
Sarge, I am way too sleep-deprived to deal with your negativity right now.
Let me show you what I did.
I started off by making a map of all of the burglaries that have gone down in Brooklyn since 1996 to see if there was a pattern.
That led me to this.
There is so much crime in New York.
No one should live here.
Anyways, I tripped out on that for a couple hours, but I got cheered up after a took a picture of the kitties messing around in my little hoodie.
I'll show it to you later.
So basically, you wasted a whole night.
No, no, no, my friend.
No, no, no, 'cause then I dove back into your file and found this.
Cool, the low point of my entire life.
Sarge, this photo was taken in 1996.
You told me your guy broke his spine two years before that, so '94.
Check out his sneakers.
'95 Jordans.
They came out a year after the accident.
Look at the soles.
They're all muddy.
Which means That son of a bitch can walk!
- Bingo.
- Let's go!
All right.
Cat squad, assemble!
- Leave the cats.
- Okay.
Santiago, Diaz, I wanted to talk to you about our performance in yesterday's bomb defusing course.
We know, sir.
You won.
No, the three of us all failed.
Apparently our instructor felt we didn't take it seriously enough.
But Hitchcock and Scully passed.
What?
How did they defuse bombs better than we did?
- Those were bombs?
- Unbelievable.
It's a low moment for us all.
I think the lesson here is that we should not allow our competitiveness to interfere with the sanctity of our job.
Totally agree, sir.
However, there is a precision driving class next weekend.
Fastest one around the track wins.
It's on.
I'm gonna run you both off the road into a wall.
I'm gonna kill you.
Oh, my.
Hey, Chuck.
Will you bring these to the dry cleaner for me?
Tell them the red stains are blood and the brown stains are uh, let's say blood.
Well, sure.
Don't even bother putting them in a bag.
I'll just carry them in my arms.
Hey.
Beard-o.
It's time for you to get out of Charles's house today.
Hang on, ma'am.
You don't tell me what to do.
Uh, that's where you're wrong, baby girl.
I run this precinct.
Watch this.
Scully!
- Go to sleep.
- Okay.
You think you can intimidate me?
Yeah.
When I was undercover, Jimmy "The Butcher" cut off my little toe with garden shears and made me eat it as a loyalty test.
I've been through hell.
Big deal.
I worked an a sunglass kiosk at the mall for four years.
So not only have I been through hell, I was assistant manager there.
Hmm.
You're gonna get out of Chuckie's house.
And what's more, you're gonna pay him rent for the night you spent there.
- Fine.
- One more thing, babe.
You're gonna thank us both right now.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- That was amazing.
- Told you.
He just needed to be alpha'd.
Is that what happened, or did I just beta you into protecting me?
No.
No.
That's not what happened.
This is not your victory.
Sure.
Oh, my God.
Hey, there.
Remember me?
So this is weird.
Oh, no, you don't, circus trash.
Argh!
I knew it!
You could walk the whole time!
I was right about the cat accomplice too, huh?
Now where's the cat?
Been 20 years, Sarge.
Cat's probably dead.
I'm still bringing him in!
Well, Sarge, you did it.
Now how should we rub your sweet victory in the 6-5's dumb faces?
We could send them a box of rats, 'cause they're rats.
Or we could drop water balloons on their cars.
You know what?
I'm good.
I don't think we should do that.
Really?
Any of it?
Yeah, after everything you did for me encouraging me, going out on that ledge even though you were scared to tears There was an air conditioner above us.
It was dripping water on my eyes.
We've been over this.
You stayed up all night to solve the case.
It just reminded me that I have people in my life who cared about me.
I don't know why I'm spending so much time trying to prove things to people who don't.
I guess you're a big man in more ways than one.
Did not.
- What'd you do, Jake?
- Rats I did the rats.
I couldn't wait.
Enjoy the rats, you rats.
Oh, my God!
Oh, no, one's coming for me!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
1 Listen up, everyone.
While Captain Holt's out of town at his conference, I'm in charge, which means, Jake, I order you to throw out that gingerbread house.
- It's from Christmas.
- Fine But you're gonna be leaving a lot of ants with no home.
Check it out, losers.
Guess who got their dealer!
Nice!
How'd it go down?
We chased him through a subway tunnel, back up through the storm drain, Adrian and I got engaged, and then we busted him with a half kilo of coke in his sock.
Wait, wait, wait.
- What'd you just say?
- It was in his sock.
These dummies, they never think we're gonna check their socks.
No, before that, weirdo.
The getting engaged part?
Oh, yeah.
We got engaged.
- Engaged engaged?
- Yeah.
- As in, to be wed?
- Yeah.
Seriously?
Together: Yeah.
Amazing!
We wants deets.
Tell us everything!
I don't want to toot my own horn or anything, but it was super romantic.
You follow.
I'll cut him off in the alley.
Okay, wait.
You want to get married?
Yep.
Jake, can I talk to you about my wedding for a second?
Need help choosing a dress?
Big puffy bow in the back, can't go wrong.
No to all of that.
Look, Adrian is about to ask you to be his best man.
I need you to say yes and I need you to act surprised.
No problem.
Check this out.
What?
What?
Best best man?
- All right, I'll work on it.
- Okay.
Sarge does not approve of the wedding, and honestly, it is killing me.
I'm sure you're just reading into it.
No.
What are you doing?
Pimento is nuts!
Ah, so not reading into it at all.
He thinks we're rushing into things, but we're not.
I love Adrian.
Every time I see him, my heart just explodes.
Wow, that's, like, some Lionel Ritchie-grade love stuff.
Anyway, I think Sarge would like him if he actually got to know him, so during the bachelor party, I need you to show him the real Adrian.
Rosa Diaz, I promise you this.
I will make sure Sarge loves him.
Great.
Crap, here comes Adrian.
- You never saw me.
- All right.
Act surprised.
Hey, Jake, come here.
I got a question for you.
Sure.
Oh, that's very close for a question.
Jake Peralta, will you do me the honor of being my best man?
Best man?
Adrian, this is all so sudden!
- Rosa told you?
- Yeah.
- But I would be honored.
- Thank God.
- I'm gonna kiss you now.
- Oh, you don't have to.
- Already did it.
- That seals it.
So who you thinking about inviting to the bachelor party?
Maybe, like, Terry, or, I don't know, Terry's great.
Or probably Terry is available, we could ask him.
Sure, nah, I was thinking all the guys from work.
Except Chuck.
Rosa called dibs on him.
Maid of honor?
Yes, a million times, yes!
It would be an honor.
Oh, my God, that's why they call it that.
Great, but I specifically said, "co-maid-of-honor," because I am also asking Amy and Gina.
I guess that's okay, if you want to water down your Charles Boyle with a couple of ice cubes.
Count me in as long as I get eight plus-ones.
Guys, focus.
We need to start planning.
So when's the wedding?
Next summer, next fall, next winter?
Next week.
- Next what?
- Next week?
That is not enough time to plan a bridal shower, an engagement brunch, a papier-mÃ¢chÃ© sculpture of you two kissing.
Don't worry about that stuff.
The one dumb wedding thing I've always wanted was a bachelorette party.
Ah, so, cool, cool, cool.
All the pressure's on that one event, cool, cool, very cool.
Super excited for the big night.
Well, I'm happy she's excited.
I'm not sleeping for the next 24 hours.
Amen, sister.
Amen.
All right, gents, Pimento's bachelor party is tomorrow night.
I've gotten us a party bus, reservations at a delightful steakhouse, and a DVD copy of "American Beauty" to watch at midnight.
That last thing was his only request.
I'm not sure if it's his favorite movie or if he's just never seen it.
I'm surprised he didn't want us all to get drunk and slash each other with machetes.
He's not exactly stable.
Die, bug!
Oh, no, he's dead.
Oh, what have I done?
That was 18 days ago.
He's getting saner by the minute.
In a month, he'll basically just be Frasier.
Don't use Frasier's name in vain.
- Copy that.
- Yeah, Sarge.
If Jake wants to pay for us to have a fun night out, let's not stop him.
I'm not paying for it.
We're splitting it.
Well, then, I'm with Terry.
This wedding's a sham.
I'm looking out for Rosa, like I'd look out for anyone in my squad.
I get it, but you're just saying that 'cause you don't know the real Adrian.
And this bachelor party is gonna change all that.
We're gonna eat steaks, we're gonna smoke cigars.
We're gonna look at naked ladies.
No, Hitchcock, we're keeping it classy.
- Right, just their boobs.
- No, no boobs.
Look, Sarge, Rosa loves him.
Will you at least promise me you'll keep an open mind?
Fine, mind open.
But for the record, I think they're making a mistake, and this whole thing is gonna blow up.
Fun attitude.
Save it for the party bus.
Rosa, we could really use your input on the bachelorette party.
See, we all have different ideas and no one is compromising.
I would compromise, but I refuse to not do mine.
- Whose idea is best?
- Excellent question.
Here's a rundown of mine, the "elevator pitch," if you will.
Has this ever happened to you?
You show up at a bachelorette party Ding, the elevator doors closed.
No one can hear you.
We cannot hear you.
Now before I tell you my idea, are you allergic to dolphins?
Why don't we just do all three parties?
Oh, and then you pick your favorite at the end.
I.E., mine.
- Sounds good.
- Sounds great.
May the best maid win.
-  - Wow, how cool is this?
A TV on a bus?
I never thought I'd see that.
Where's the groom already?
Who doesn't show up on time for their own party?
You mean, besides Gina?
Every year without fail.
Yeah.
Look, you said you'd keep an open mind for Pimento.
He'll show.
Just give him a shot.
Is everybody comfortable back there?
Does anybody need any aah!
Sir, are you okay?
Hello?
We need to go now!
Okay, just keep that mind open.
I'm sure there's a perfectly stable explanation for this.
Someone's trying to kill me!
Mind closed, Jake!
Mind closed.
Yep.
Look, I know you're upset because Pimento seems a little amped up We were going 90 with the headlights off!
But please just give him a chance to explain before getting all angry and yelling, "Hey, man"!
Hey, man!
What the hell were you doing?
Great, Sarge, can I just talk to you outside for one moment?
BRB.
BRB.
BRB.
Sarge, he's a good cop.
IF you ask him in a supportive, non-confrontational manner, he'll give you a calm, logical answer.
Fine.
Why do you want to know?
Who are you working for?
I will cut you, little man.
Cool.
Hey, uh, Adrian?
Can I borrow you for one sec?
Look, we're all on your side here, Pimento.
We all want to believe that you're about to be murdered.
Thanks, man.
But you gotta lay out some facts and you gotta do it calmly.
Okay, here's everything I know.
- It all started - Jake, a word, please.
- What?
- I don't know.
Everybody else got to go outside.
Get back on the bus!
Sorry.
Adrian, you were saying?
Someone's been following me for two days.
White guy, svelte, thick brown hair, piercing blue eyes.
I don't know, I guess you'd consider him classically handsome.
- Is that weird to say?
- No.
I mean, is it?
No, I don't think so.
Anyway, this morning I turned the tables, followed him home.
We need to go there now, so we can get the drop on him.
Smart, sane, rational.
Sarge, what do you think?
Fine, we can go.
But only to prove he's making this all up.
Okay, okay.
The important thing is, you agreed we can go and you and Pimento are best friends now.
Let's do it!
All right, who's up first?
Party number one will be brought to you by Gina Linetti.
And good times.
Where exactly are these good times?
Because so far, the first six seconds of your party are a big old snooze.
Tonight we will be attending my nephew Anthony's 13th birthday party.
Sounds awful.
Teenage boys are the worst.
But shooting them with paintballs in the behind is the best, which is what we're gonna do.
It's a paintball party.
- Nice.
- Let's go shoot my nephew.
Gina, do you have any idea what you're getting into?
We play in a league.
A league.
- Ow!
- Oops.
You're all gonna die tonight!
Unleash hell.
Ow, ow, ow!
Ow, ow, ow!
Well, well, well, guess I nailed it.
Pressure's on, guys.
Good.
Pressure's my jab.
- Ow!
- I'm engaged!
Okay, now the guy's in that building right there.
If Figgis hired him, that means he's highly trained, armed, and very dangerous.
The only problem is, none of us are packing.
Oh, not a problem.
I've got an arsenal in my pants.
together: Damn!
Guys, game faces on.
I don't know what's on the other side of that door, but I know it's gonna be brutal.
And it's empty.
No one's been in here for years.
- I can't believe I was wrong.
- I can.
Okay, look, this was maybe a weird way to start the night, but the good news is, we can still make our dinner reservation and no one got hurt.
Actually, I cut myself real bad.
Of course you did.
Party round two: the quiz.
Winner gets a question mark crown.
So cool.
Um, I'll take Lonely Arts and Crafts for 800.
First of all, I've made many friends through arts and crafts.
And how many of them are googly eyes?
And secondly, it's a drinking game.
Get a question wrong, do a shot.
Oh, and the questions?
They're all about Rosa.
But none of us know anything about Rosa.
Everyone's about to get real hammered.
What is my favorite soup?
Chicken noodle.
Potato leek.
Corn frickin' noodle.
I mean, chowder, damn it.
You're all wrong.
I've never had soup.
Don't bother.
They all suck.
Drink!
Battle axe.
Upper cut.
Disembowelment.
Guys, I was a baby.
My first word was "Da-da".
Drink!
Wrong!
I can totally do a handstand.
Ooh!
- Oh!
- Told ya.
Good luck following this party, ya bish.
I'd like to make a toast to the groom-to-be, Adrian Pimento.
Don't bother, Jake.
Everybody's pissed at me.
No, no, we're not.
We're all supporting you.
We're doing separate checks, right?
I told you, we're splitting it.
All right, sure, tonight got off to a weird, rocky start, but you know what else got off to a weird, rocky start?
America, and we all love America now, right?
Well, it's no Amsterdam.
And you know who else we also love?
Rosa Diaz.
Some of us even love her so much that it makes us act a little crazy sometimes.
You're talking about me, right?
Yeah!
Ah, I would kill all of you for her.
That's sweet.
Right?
- So let's raise our glass.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
I'd also like to make a toast.
Easy on the dings, man.
One ding'll do.
Thank you guys so much for this party.
It means everything to me.
And I'm sorry that earlier I went a little off the rails, hijacked the bus, stole all of your wallets to double check your identities.
What?
But with friends like you, I'm finally starting to feel like There he is!
I got him down!
I got him down!
Somebody check his pockets!
What the hell?
Man, this is crazy!
Sarge, look.
A gun and a picture of Pimento.
What do you have to say now?
I guess someone's trying to kill him.
That's right!
In your face!
Someone's trying to kill him!
Whoo!
I mean, a man's life is in danger.
Probably shouldn't be so pumped.
Look, I'm sorry I doubted you.
I'm also sorry that someone's trying to kill you, but I can really only take ownership for the first part.
It's okay, Sarge.
I would've doubted me too.
I mean, you guys probably haven't noticed anything, but I've been acting pretty unstable lately.
Well, personally, I think I also deserve an apology.
No?
Okay, that's totally cool.
- So what's our plan?
- Okay.
I'm gonna make this guy talk.
Okay, all I need is a car battery, jumper cables, and unfettered access to his nibs.
As much as I'd like to see that, I think you might be a little too close to this.
Maybe I should ask the questions.
Hey, Jackie, if you're asking the waiter questions, find out when the mashed potatoes are coming.
He's not a real waiter, man!
Hang on, we don't know that for sure.
- Are you a waiter as well?
- Mm-mm.
- No.
- Yeah, Terry was right.
Yeah.
So, you had a picture of my friend and a loaded gun.
Can't wait to hear what crazy story you tell to justify that.
I'm a contract killer who was hired to kill Adrian Pimento.
Oh.
That went much easier than I was expecting.
Still gonna brag.
I did it, guys.
- I broke him.
- Who wants me dead?
Someone in Figgis's organization?
I don't know.
I haven't met the guy.
Once I finish the job, I'm supposed to text him a photo of the body.
Then we meet up and I get the money.
Interesting.
So he has no clue what you look like.
Mm-mm.
Gentlemen, I just thought of a plan.
Stage Pimento's death and go to the meet-up ourselves.
Great plan, Sarge!
No, I was gonna say it first.
I thought of it before you did.
You know, whatever, let's just do Sarge's thing, I guess.
All right, Boyle, you're up.
- Where we goin'?
- A restaurant.
Specifically, Le Petit Colon.
It means small intestine, 'cause that's all they serve.
Oh, man, I was rootin' for you.
I don't think I can eat that.
Neither can anyone else, which is why they shut it down.
We are not eating at this restaurant.
We are demolishing it.
Damn!
Boyle's playing to win!
Yeah!
Madame, may I offer you the first whack?
I've been dreaming about this since I was a little girl.
Guys, love is beautiful.
Okay, we need to make my main man Pimento look super murdered, like Tarantino disgusting murdered.
- You ready?
- Murder me, bro.
Sarge, blood.
Headshot.
Damn, it feels good to be creative again.
And here comes the brains.
All right, now all you need to do is put some water on my crotch.
What?
Why?
Obviously because everybody who gets shot pees them self.
No, they don't.
That's not true.
Actually, he's right.
Every single time.
I'm just gonna take the photo from the waist up, okay?
Fine, but for the record, I think I should've peed myself.
All right, noted.
Photo taken and sent.
Nice.
Wow, that was a quick response.
Someone's a bit of a thirsty gangster.
He wants to meet up.
And he wants me to bring him your tongue.
Ah, how did I not see this coming?
That's what Figgis does to snitches.
Well, game over, guys.
I mean, where are we gonna get a tongue?
Relax, I'm just gonna text Boyle.
He's always eating weird stuff like tongues and chicken faces.
Oh, and he's already texted me back with a top-ten list.
Well, the groomsmen are having a great time.
Jake just texted me about where to get a veal tongue.
- Hmm?
- Tonight was amazing, which I didn't think was possible with you guys.
I don't know why we were competing.
If you ask me, what we're doing right now, just hanging out, is the best part of the whole night.
- I don't even care who won.
- Charles won.
- What?
- Huh?
Yeah, he had the best party.
We broke so much stuff!
Whoo!
You guys, I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with Adrian Pimento.
My heart is so full.
Mama Mia!
To Rosa and Pimento!
All: Rosa and Pimento!
Guys, I really don't want to hold this tongue much longer.
It's weirdly heavy.
You're in luck.
Car just pulled in.
- I think it's our guy.
- Copy that.
Oh, same ski mask.
That's awkward.
Don't worry about it.
Happens all the time.
You have the tongue?
Yeah, this guy won't be snitching in heaven.
I mean, hell, obviously, he's going to hell.
We all are; we're bad guys.
Anyway, here's his tongue.
It's all there.
Jimmy Figgis thanks you.
Yeah, he's on the move.
I'm coming to you.
Where's this sicko leading us now?
Lightbulb Hut?
All About the Bagel?
- Bill's Pools?
- Stop reading signs.
Can't.
I'm too amped up.
I didn't recognize this guy.
If he works for Figgis, he's new.
In fairness, there's probably a lot of turnover in his line of work, what with the constant death and everything.
Where's he going now?
Oh, what the hell?
That's the FBI building.
He's an agent.
Oh, Adrian.
Your bachelor party sucks butt.
Ah, I'm freaking out, man.
I'm freaking out!
Just stay calm and be methodical.
Right?
What do we know?
Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis has a man in the FBI.
And he tried to have Pimento killed.
And I cut my other cheek.
How?
I took the knife away from you.
Oh, man.
That's it.
I-I gotta completely disappear.
It's not safe for me here.
And what if Rosa gets caught in the crossfire?
No, no, no.
Listen.
We're gonna protect you guys, and we're gonna take these guys down.
- Right, Sarge?
- Absolutely.
No, no, no, don't you see?
Right now, they think I'm dead.
This is my only chance to get away safe.
Jake I need you to tell Rosa that I love her.
Okay?
Do that for me.
Also, tell her this.
Oh.
Oh my.
Ew.
That is very graphic, Adrian.
Got it?
I don't think I can say any of that to Rosa.
And also, you can't leave without saying good-bye to her.
You owe her that much.
No can do.
It's just too dangerous.
Good-bye, Nine-Nine.
And with that, I left.
Oh, sweet, sweet coffee.
Come to mama.
Shut your loud mouth, Amy.
Some of us have a hangover.
Man, last night was dope.
Wait, did Gina really go to Puerto Rico with that drug store cashier?
Yeah.
They seemed really happy.
- They really did.
- Yeah.
Huh.
Hey, man.
How'd it go last night?
Sarge cool with Adrian now?
Oh, so you haven't seen him, huh?
No.
I figured he just passed out at your place or something.
Why?
What's going on?
Oh, man.
Let's go for a walk.
He wanted me to tell you that he loves you.
Is that it?
Did he say anything else?
Um May the lord be with you.
- Adrian.
- Oh, thank God.
You scared me.
I thought you left.
I did.
I was burning my fingerprints off in a gas station bathroom when I thought about what Jake said.
I couldn't leave without seeing you one last time.
I want to lick your whole body clean like a kitty cat.
And I'm gonna give you two a little space.
I have to go.
But I'll be back for you.
I'll wait.
And while I'm waiting, I will find that FBI agent and I will rip his head off with my bare hands.
That is the sweetest thing anybody's ever said to me.
I love you.
I love you.
You okay?
Yeah, I will be.
I watched you guys kiss.
I didn't know where to look.
- All right, let's go inside.
- Okay.
Sergeant Jeffords briefed me about the Pimento situation.
Sounds like I missed a hell of a week.
We need to bring Figgis to justice and find whoever is helping him in the FBI.
As of right now, we have very little to go on.
Yeah, the guy was wearing a ski mask, but he had a large scar on his right palm.
I have a similar scar on my back.
Banged into Amy's kitchen cabinet.
No big deal.
Continue.
This mission is top secret.
No one can know what we're doing.
Detective Pimento's a good man and he's one of us.
So let's catch these bastards for him and Rosa.
- Nine-Nine!
- Discretely, Jacob.
Nine-Nine.
Nine-Nine!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
1  Ka-blamo, scrubs.
I nailed it.
I solved Captain Holt's brain teaser and found the location of our secret meeting.
The answer?
The broom closet.
In your face.
- In whose face now?
- Yours.
Gina and I have been here 20 minutes.
Though my presence is not puzzle-related.
I just followed Terry into a dark closet.
Hey.
You solved the puzzle before me.
Nerds.
They solved it first.
They're the nerds.
I'm cool like you.
Wait.
Where's Captain Holt?
Where's Amy?
Yeah, she should be the first one here.
Doesn't she go to, like, an adult puzzle camp every summer?
Yes, but please don't bring that up.
I've been throwing out her mailers.
Guys, if those two aren't here, I'm thinking we must be in the wrong place.
No, trust me, we're definitely in the right place.
I'm 100% sure about this.
Well, guess who solved the puzzle?
- Who?
- We did.
Oh, we did?
Yeah, we're in the wrong place.
Thank you for all finally showing up.
Let's recap.
As you know, Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis put out a hit on Adrian Pimento, which the mob believes succeeded.
For his safety Pimento has gone off the grid.
Remember, the only people we can trust with this information are in this room.
And Genevieve.
We can trust Genevieve.
We share a life.
I tell her everything.
Fine, the people in this room, and Genevieve.
Genevieve's mom also knows, but she's in a coma, dead any second, we're good.
Okay.
Unfortunately, we can't just arrest Figgis, because he has a man inside the FBI.
The good news is, we have a lead that's gonna break this case wide open: Maura Figgis, Jimmy's sister.
She's currently serving in a maximum security prison in Texas.
A white woman in prison, in Texas?
She must be bad.
She murdered three people, and she knows Figgis's operation, so we're sending a detective in undercover as an inmate to get close to her.
Yeah, and guys, this isn't one of those women's prisons that we've all seen being all sexy on late-night cable.
You know, with the ladies touching each other's bits, and there's kind of some lame jazz playing.
When these chicks fight, it's for real.
So be mature.
Peralta is gross, but correct.
Mm.
This facility is a violent place filled with hardened criminals We need to send someone who can blend in.
Sir, I would be honored to take on this challenging assignment.
Why is everyone laughing?
I can be a badass.
You're raising your hand right now.
We're in a meeting.
I just assumed Diaz would be the prisoner.
Nothing personal, it's just, you know she's terrifying.
- Thank you, Sir.
- Mm-hmm.
Dismissed.
Hey, that was crazy, right?
I mean, I can be scary.
Oh, yeah.
I watch "Jeopardy" with you and you're a straight-up psycho.
Aww.
Thanks, babe.
I'll take "Awesome Girlfriends" for 500, Alex.
I know you're being sweet, but don't disparage "Jeopardy".
Okay.
- All right, listen up.
-  You're not gonna try to convince us Mahler was the original punk rocker again, are you?
No, the music is a classic counter-espionage maneuver.
I don't want to be overheard.
But, since you mention it, Mahler was one in-your-face bad boy.
Right, um, so, what's going on, sir?
Oh, I have a plan to draw out Figgis's man in the  Throw a funeral for Pimento.
Now, before we, quote, unquote, bury Pimento, we need to, quote, unquote, open an investigation, find a, quote, unquote, corpse, and obtain a, quote, unquote, death certificate.
Kind of feel like you could have just used "air quotes".
I can also wear short pants and drink for a jug that says "XXX".
Fake funeral's a good idea, sir, but where are we gonna find a corpse?
We don't need one.
We just need pictures for the case file.
If I may, imagine Pimento's dirty, pale body being pulled out of a manhole after a couple days' sewer bloat.
- Mm.
- Now squint your eyes and look at Hitchcock.
Oh, yes.
I believe we've found our corpse.
You positively glow.
How do you feel?
Great.
I could smother somebody in their sleep with this thing.
Pregnancy's dope.
Whoa, bup, bup, bup.
That big old womb is not a weapon, okay?
It's just an excuse to talk to your doctors, AKA, Charles and me, in private.
If you need to chat, just schedule an appointment with Brent Kennedy, ob-gyn.
And I'm Glen Kennedy, ob-gyn.
We're twins, like "Property Brothers," but for gynecology.
- No, I said no to that idea.
-  You are Isaac Schwartz, my older Jewish mentor, and you are Isabel Cortez.
You're in for stabbing a man on the subway 46 times in the trachea.
Tight.
The pregnancy stuff is my area of expertise.
Since Genevieve started fertility treatments, it's all we talk about.
Now show me your waddle.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm, okay.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, okay, okay.
Nice.
Good work.
You really look like a corpse.
And I'm not even wearing makeup.
Time of death: 8:26 p.m. Now all I have to do is sign as the coroner.
You are disturbingly good at this.
I grew up forging report cards.
If people knew how smart I was, it would have been harder to control them.
Now all we need is the death certificate officially notarized.
You want me to break the sacred oath I took to become a notary?
It's not a problem.
'Cause I'm a badass.
Just like Rosa.
So I am going to stamp this, and violate my oath You can keep talking, but we're done here.
Adrian Pimento is officially deceased.
Excellent.
All this sneaking around is exhilarating.
I can feel the adrenaline coursing through my body.
Coursing.
- -  - Isabel Cortez, welcome to your new home.
- This is gonna be fun.
- Really?
What are your weekends like, Diaz?
All right.
It's time, Detective.
Don't forget, you're seven months pregnant.
Your cervix is ripening as we speak.
Mention my cervix again and I will rip your throat out.
I don't understand.
You don't like it when he talks about your cervix ripening?
Okay, have fun.
They grow up so fast.
Okay, fresh meat.
You're being transferred here because you made trouble in your last prison.
That won't fly here.
Stay in your lane.
Hey.
You're that cop who arrested me three years ago in Brooklyn.
Uh Amy Santiago, you're going to prison.
I don't know.
Is anyone gonna buy it?
I mean, do I look pregnant?
I mean I guess I can see it.
I think it's amazing.
Oh, Jake and Amy and baby makes three.
I don't know if I believe in God, but I have prayed for this.
- That is psychotic.
-  All right, Ames, let's go over your cover story again.
Okay.
My name is Isabel Cortez, I'm in for murder, 'cause some perv on the subway tried to touch me and I was like, "Did someone order a tracheotomy"?
Okay, I think that's a little too technical.
We need to work on your tough talk.
So, what are you in for, Cortez?
None of your damn business.
Nice.
Keep going with that.
I'm gonna split you like a sundae with Grandpa bitch.
Okay.
Okay.
The "bitch" part was great.
Yeah.
Although, mean threats generally don't involve having desserts with your grandparents.
So, just try again.
Keep telling me what to do and I'll stab your face off.
- Hell yes!
- Damn!
Like that.
Okay, now, here's the plan.
Instead of you approaching Maura, we're gonna get her to come to you.
Yeah, try and spread the word that you've got a connect on the outside that gives you access to contrabands: cigarettes, burner phones Pornography.
Amy, women don't watch - They do.
- Mm.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, wow.
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.
Well, that's an exciting revelation for me.
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.
Sorry prison didn't work out.
Eh, I'll find another use for that shiv.
Also, I'm sorry about Pimento.
I mean, I know how hard it is to have a fiancÃ© disappear because the mob and the FBI want 'em dead.
I mean Actually, I can't relate at all.
It's the saddest story I ever heard.
Look, you wanna talk, I'm a good listener.
There's nothing to be sad about.
Pimento's gonna come back, we're gonna get married and we're gonna have sex on Figgis's grave just like we planned.
- Cool honeymoon.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, since you're not in prison, you can help us.
We're gonna throw a fake funeral - to draw out our FBI guy.
- Good plan.
I always thought it would be funny to kill somebody at a funeral.
Also, you're gonna have to play the grieving fiancÃ©.
- What?
- So you may not be sad, but you're gonna need to look it.
Fine.
Boo hoo.
Maybe we'll get you a real thick veil or something.
- -  Cellmates!
All right, our camera is up.
We have picture and sound.
Amy should be meeting her new cellmate any second now.
- Sup.
- Sup.
Good, she's abbreviating, just like we practiced, even though she hates it.
- She's gonna do just fine.
- Oh, yeah.
I drilled her for hours.
Ew.
I'm sorry, I just realized what that sounded like.
It's okay, Jake.
I wish we'd talk like that more.
No.
Where you from?
Passed around the system.
Never stayed anywhere long enough to call it home.
Ooh, that's a good answer.
Yeah, that one was mine.
I speak the language of the streets.
It was actually from "Girl, Interrupted".
Yeah.
Oh, it's happening.
She dropped the contraband.
Hey, where you get that crap?
I got a hookup on the outside, so I can get anything for a price.
This is yours if you can get the word out about my store.
Okay, I can do that.
Cellie for my cellie.
Oh, no wordplay?
Abort.
Cellie?
I get it.
Funny.
- Oh, it actually worked.
- Huh.
People are really starved for entertainment in here.
- Jail is hell.
- Yeah.
All that we know about Figgis's man in the FBI is that he's a white male of average height and build, and according to Jake, he has a scar on his hand.
Oh, this is a long-shot, but if his name is Joe, could we call him Scar-Joe?
Scar-Joe.
Never heard that before.
I like it.
We'll use it.
Now, funeral assignments.
Gina and I will greet people, shaking hands and checking for the tell-tale scar.
Excuse me, sir.
Are you sure you want to be on the receiving line?
You hate small talk.
No, I can turn it on when it's called for.
"The Bachelor" is a television show, hmm?
Andre Agassi's at it again.
I, too, avoid gluten.
Okay.
I want the rest of you checking out the crowd for anyone suspicious.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?
No, we just all came in here separately and then started chatting, you know, breezy stuff.
"The Bachelor" is a television show.
Andre Agassi's at it again.
I, too, am avoiding gluten.
Do you see Amy?
How is she?
Great.
She just got lunch, double helping of spinach.
Baby's gonna love that folic acid.
You are so strange.
All right, this is her first time eating in the dining hall.
Where she chooses to sit is very important.
Oh, good, she's headed towards that table of hot blonde girls.
Wait a minute.
No.
They're Nazis.
The hotties are Nazis.
They're hot-zis.
Swerve, Amy, swerve!
Good, good, good, good, good, good.
Okay, and All right, sitting alone.
Bold choice, bold choice.
Hmm.
Oh, here comes Maura.
Hey, Cortez.
I hear you can smuggle in crap from outside.
Noice, it's working.
That's right, baby.
What do you want?
What I want is for you to back the hell off because I'm the only store in this prison.
Uh-oh.
Well, I didn't see your name on the outside of the prison, unless your name is Texas State Penitentiary Comma Spring Valley Unit.
Oh, this is bad.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but she should have sat with the hot-zis.
Hey, what's going on?
I was talking to Figgis and then the guard said I had an appointment.
I'm not supposed to check in until tomorrow.
People might get suspicious.
Look, we called you in because your first contact with Figgis was a disaster.
Why?
Because our smuggling plan backfired and she threatened to kill me?
Yes, every single detail of what you just said.
- We need a new plan.
- And I've got one.
- I need to step to her.
- Step to her?
Amy, this isn't "High School Musical".
Yeah, Amy, this isn't "High School Musical 2".
Yeah, and it isn't "High School Musical 3: Senior Year".
All right.
Point is, it's not a high school musical.
- That's right.
- I got it.
Look, Figgis is seriously dangerous, all right?
She's killed more people in prison than she did on the outside.
I know, and if I back down now she'll never respect me and we'll get nowhere with her.
Trust me, I've got this.
Okay, I can see that logic, but in the interest of keeping you as un-shanked as possible, I think maybe we need a signal in case things go south.
Ooh, I know.
Scratch your butt.
No, that's no good.
What if her butt itches for real?
I think I can handle it.
I've made it through 20 years of adulthood without scratching my butt in public.
- Amy.
- Amy.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Both: Come on.
All right.
Never?
Ames, come on.
Come on.
Yo, it's too bad, right?
Hello, thank you so much for coming.
High five?
Detective Pimento didn't want his funeral to feel stuffy.
Condolences, my man.
What's going on, sir?
Why are you high-fiving the bereaved?
The handshakes weren't working.
You couldn't see the inside of the thumb webbing.
Gina came up with an artful solution.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Get some.
The system works.
Any sign of Scar-Joe?
Not yet.
I don't know how much more of this I can take.
All these jerks keep on asking me how I'm doing.
This shouldn't be so difficult.
Your fiancÃ© did really leave.
Just act sad about it.
Fine, I'll pretend to be sad.
I'll make myself cry.
Watch:  That's not how this works.
Or is it?
Suck it, Sarge.
Hey.
Give me those 20-pounders.
Wait your turn, Baby-Sitters Club.
No weight lifting.
You can shoot that baby across the room.
Come on.
What's going on?
I was stepping to her.
I know, but it wasn't a good time.
She was holding a 20-pound weight.
That's basically Thor's hammer, babe.
- I can handle myself.
- Cool, yeah.
Just, you know, don't confront her when she's armed.
Fine.
Seriously?
She was at lunch.
She didn't have a weapon.
She had a fork.
That's like four tiny shivs on a stick.
What the hell?
Socks are just a noose waiting to be braided.
We were playing hearts.
In the wrong hands, every playing card is like a throwing star.
She was alone, her hands were empty, and I think she was napping.
So what was the big threat this time?
You did the signal.
You scratched your butt.
Right, Boyle?
Uh, I don't know.
I was focused on her waddle.
Which you are nailing, by the way.
Well, I know for a fact that I didn't scratch my butt because my right cheek was actually itchy and I fought through it.
I know what's really going on here.
You don't think I'm tough enough to do this.
Okay, you know what?
Fine, you're right, I don't.
But it's only because Maura is so much more terrifying than we anticipated.
I mean, she has a full back tattoo of herself stabbing a guy.
He looks like Tom Hanks!
Yeah, and that's America's male sweetheart.
I can't believe this.
You wouldn't tell Rosa to stand down.
Well, yeah, because she's Rosa.
I mean, one time, I saw her eat a whole apple using a knife, just like in the movies.
Get over the apple thing.
That was three years ago.
I know, it was just so cool.
Look, I'm your handler, all right?
You have to just trust me on this.
My job is to keep you safe.
It's the right call.
Fine, I'll slow-play it.
But people are getting suspicious, so you can't come running in every time I'm in the same room with her, okay?
Yeah, okay.
Are we good?
Yeah, we're good.
This is so sweet.
Now kiss her belly.
- Boyle!
- Boyle!
So let us all bow our heads and join together for a moment of silence.
This church is so quiet.
Pretty normal for a moment of silence.
Captain has eyes on a guy he thinks might be Scar-Joe.
Okay, be cool.
Let's check him out.
Please make me defile this church.
What do you want?
Take off your gloves and show us your hands.
And no scar.
He's just a glove-wearing freak with beautiful hands.
Why did he run then?
He's a pickpocket.
I guess the bereft are easy targets.
Also, Scully, here's your wallet back.
How's Amy doing?
Is she paying enough attention to her pelvic floor?
Ignoring that.
She is keeping a low profile, just like we discussed.
I'm really impressed with you two.
You disagreed with the best strategy, but talked it through like adults.
Well, the key is trust.
I trust her to stay out of danger, and she trusts me not to interfere.
Oh, my God.
She just pushed Figgis into the garbage.
She's in danger.
I must interfere.
What the hell do you think you're doing, huh?
Showing my unborn baby how an ass gets kicked.
All right, Cortez, time for your checkup.
No, thank you, I feel fine.
No, you don't.
It's your uterus, it's gonna explode.
- What?
- Come with me.
Stand back, everyone.
You're all in the splash zone.
-  - This ute's gonna boot.
Here we go.
-  - What the hell?
We agreed you weren't gonna do that.
You disobeyed a direct order from your handler.
Yeah, I did.
Because that order was crap.
I did the right thing and it's insulting that you don't see that.
Hey, hey, hey.
The baby can hear you yelling and it's upsetting him.
It's a fake baby, Charles.
I meant me.
The baby's a cover.
Okay, stop.
You're right.
I'm 100% in the wrong.
The truth is, I'm the one that's not tough enough to be in here.
I mean, watching the woman I love, unarmed, locked up with all these murderers.
It's just too much for me.
Oh, my God.
Amy, go to him.
- I screwed up.
- No, you didn't.
I get it.
Being a cop and dating a cop It's harder than I thought it would be.
I worry about you too.
Oh, my God.
Jake, go to her.
Look, I was just trying to keep you safe, but I wasn't letting you do your job.
I'm sorry.
Why aren't you going to each other?
I think I have to take myself off of this assignment.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
You got this.
Hopefully, I haven't already blown your cover by dragging you into my office so many times.
Also, I'm pretty sure a lot of people heard me say that your baby's blood type is "OG".
Yeah, you're a pretty terrible doctor.
Mm-hmm.
But I think I know how to get things back on track.
Hey, Cortez, you're late for your appointment.
Quit touching me.
Oh!
Ugh!
I don't need checkups every two seconds, you dimple-chinned freak!
Oh!
Aah ow!
You're so tough and I'm just a beautiful intellectual.
-  - Hey, I love beating up doctors.
- Can I get in there?
- No!
He's mine.
All of you, back off!
I'm kicking for two.
Sorry that wasn't Scar-Joe.
I don't want to talk about it.
Talking about your feelings is for losers.
I guess Adele's a loser in your world.
Look, the funeral's almost over, we basically pulled it off.
All you've got to do is give a convincing eulogy.
Roger that.
Pimento's dead.
Thanks for coming.
Adrian Pimento was very special to me.
And now he's gone.
And I'm starting to realize there's nothing I can do to bring him back.
I guess life is just gonna suck for a while.
But it's nice to know there's a room full of people who is sucks for too.
I'd also like to add the next person who hugs me gets their necks snapped.
And she's back.
Okay, this is it, I'm leaving.
You're in charge.
I'll take extra good care of her, Jake.
Just let her do her thing.
But this is Texas, so also make sure she doesn't somehow get the death penalty.
Mm-hmm.
Stay tough, Cortez.
You're touching her boob.
Should I turn away, or I'm not touching her boob.
She's tiny on the screen.
I'm just saying good-bye, man.
You know, why don't I turn and give you privacy?
No, don't turn.
That's what makes it weird.
Ugh!
Well, we pulled it off.
Nice eulogy.
- I thought it was dumb.
- Sergeant?
Excuse me?
You said there's nothing you can do to bring him back, but you're wrong.
None of us are gonna stop fighting until he comes home.
Thanks.
And if you ever need to talk, or get drunk, or throw stuff off a roof, I mean, I don't know your process.
Am I hitting on anything here?
The roof thing sounds pretty good.
Very well.
Let's throw something off the roof and then we'll get back to work.
High five.
I quite like them now.
What are you looking at?
You got a problem?
Whoa.
Cool it, killer.
I just wanted to say good job on beating the crap out of that doctor.
Oh.
Thanks.
I like you.
You got balls.
Maybe you should come work for me.
I could use a bruiser on my crew.
I'm not a bruiser.
I'm a psycho.
Even better.
Nice job, Cortez.
Oh, I touched her boob.
I've got to tell Jake!
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
1 I called you here to discuss where we are with Operation 225641441636324.
What?
I assigned a numerical value to each letter in the word "pimento," which I then squared.
Oh, Captain.
How dare you try and sneak math into this?
Peralta.
Update us on Santiago's undercover prison operation.
Yeah, she has made contact with Jimmy Figgis' sister, but it's slowgoing.
I hope she comes back soon.
Aww.
You miss her?
No, I lost the key to her apartment, and I'm taking care of her fish.
They're all dead already, aren't they?
- Yeah.
- Damn it.
Our priority is still finding Figgis' agent in the FBI.
I think it's time for me to call in a favor from an old colleague at the bureau, Bob Anderson.
I would've contacted him sooner, but this is a rogue op, and he's a real stickler for the rules.
He once picked up a penny off the street, which he then reported on his taxes.
Sounds like a barrel of laughs.
Fortunately, he isn't.
We worked together back in the day and really hit it off.
We're going to be here a while.
Would you like to talk?
I'd rather not.
Agreed.
Oh, man.
A secret FBI meet up?
I love this!
Look at all those idiots.
They have no idea what's about to go down.
You mean that woman and her baby?
Yep.
Idiots.
Oh, here comes Bob.
Please behave.
Hello, Bob.
Good to see you.
And you.
Apologies.
It's inappropriate for me to partake in such informal conversation in front of your detectives.
It's all right.
I am equally to blame.
Oh, my God.
There's two of them.
So, Raymond, what evidence do you have that there's a dirty agent in the FBI?
Let's see the file.
We don't have a file.
You're working file-less?
We saw the guy commit a felony.
He tried to have a cop killed.
Crazy hot cop.
Well, he's a specific type.
Look, the guy we're looking for was wearing a ski mask, but he's about 5'10".
Caucasian.
He's got a big scar on his right hand.
We've been calling him ScarJo, like the actress, Scarlett Johansson.
What?
An actress?
I didn't know that was where that was from.
Bob, I'm so sorry.
- No, I'll look past it.
- Okay.
There's an agent that matches that description.
His name is Ryan Whealon.
You think you could ID him if you saw him?
Oh, yeah.
I'd recognize that scar from 20 miles away.
You must have fantastic vision.
Or it's a gigantic scar.
I was clearly exaggerating.
Why do you have to ruin everything?
Dr. Schwartz, I'm here for my appointment.
Hello, Cortez.
Shabbat Shalom.
"Shabbat Shalom"?
I don't know.
Jake made me Jewish.
So how are things going with Maura?
Well, I'm part of her crew, but she still won't talk about her past.
So, what kind of stuff did you used to do in New York?
What's with all the questions, Regis?
Actually, it's Michael Strahan now.
What?
She's so scary.
I saw her pull her own tooth out and throw it into a woman's eye.
Yeah, that's bad.
So guess what.
Genevieve just texted.
We're gonna hear about our adoption any minute.
I thought you were doing fertility treatments.
We are, but it's not going well.
The doctor said my sterility is so aggressive, - it may have spread to her.
- Okay.
But, adoption!
Charles, that's amazing!
- I know!
- Oh, no.
- What?
- Maura.
Anyway, Ms. Cortez, your vagina looks great.
Mazel.
Did you see this morning's newspaper?
No.
I get all my news from a text message chain with my friends.
The attorney general might step down!
I'm kidding.
It's a GIF of a rabbit eating spaghetti.
There's an article about the Nine-Nine's monthly crime rate.
Those numbers aren't supposed to be public until next week.
Terry, you're gonna have to be more interesting if you want to get an "oh, dang".
There's a leak in the Nine-Nine!
Oh, dang.
I presented those numbers in a morning briefing, but I can't imagine anyone would be stupid enough to leak 'em.
Really, Terrence?
Look how dumb they are.
- Ugh!
- D'aww!
Printer's fixed.
Oh, dang.
Tell Peralta Whealon's approaching.
Here comes the douche bag.
Gray suit.
Act natural.
Wow, look at that.
What a great magazine.
Sir, if you're interested, the new issue of "Clown Boobies" just came in.
I can unpack the box for you.
What?
Oh.
Haha.
Actually, no.
I need last month's.
There's a particular clown booby that I'm looking for.
What is Peralta doing?
He appears to be rifling through "Clown Boobies Magazine".
Whoa!
Stupid butterfingers.
- It's all right.
- Thank you.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Thank you so, so much.
Not thank you.
Not thank you at all, you dirtbag.
Hey, Cortez!
What's going on with you and that doctor?
You seem real tight with him.
No, we're not tight.
I barely know him.
So why were you hugging him?
My last appeal got denied, so he was comforting me.
He's a sensitive guy.
Maybe because of his Jewish faith.
I want to talk to him.
Alone.
Oh.
About something medical?
Or What did I tell you about asking too many questions?
Right.
That's that thing you killed a bunch of bitches for.
Ah.
Got it.
Sorry.
We've been watching this guy all day.
Can't believe we haven't even arrested him yet.
We know he's the guy.
We have to build a case first.
4:13 p.m. Subject finishes his coffee.
Or tea.
Mark the beverage as "unknown".
Detectives.
What does the FBI database tell us about Whealon and Figgis?
Both of their files were completely wiped.
I've never seen that before.
Yeah, that's because he's guilty, and we're just sitting here watching him eat a peach.
That's a nectarine.
It's either a nectarine or a peach.
Just write "unknown stone fruit".
There can't just be digital files.
There must be hard copies.
Those are all under lock and key in the archives.
If I asked for clearance, they could alert him.
Interesting.
So what you're saying is our only option is to break into the FBI and steal the file.
Don't be absurd.
Bob, I apologize for the absurdity.
I see no absurdity.
Actually, I think Peralta's right.
Let's plan a heist.
Bob?
Blueprints for the New York Headquarters of the FBI.
The file we're looking for is in the archive room, here, in the basement.
We will be represented by these things I had in my pocket.
All I had was lint.
Just a pocketful of lint.
Everybody remember what your lint looks like.
My lint is round.
My lint is approximately 1 centimeter in diameter.
- My lint is blue.
- My lint is oblong.
My lint is approximately 1/2 centimeter in length.
My lint is also blue.
Wow, so no pushback on the lint thing?
This is great.
Now, I can give you clearance to get in the front door, but getting into the archive is another matter.
If I go into this bathroom, I could climb through this vent, drop down into the archive room, and steal the file.
How are you gonna get out?
Pull myself back up the way I came in.
What?
I can do a pull-up.
Terry will teach me.
This whole area is video-monitored by this guard here.
I can distract him with conversation.
What do you know about him?
Watches a lot of TV.
I heard him mention "Sex and the City".
Then I will discuss both of those shows with him.
Ooh.
"Sex and the City" is one show.
It's not a show called "Sex" and then another show called "The City".
Okay.
Good start.
- Now I know that.
- Oh.
I can disable the security DVRs, but I need some way of getting to a station unnoticed.
I have an idea on how to smuggle you in, but it'll be a tight fit.
I'm flexible.
I do a lot of yoga.
You do yoga?
Helps keep me centered.
If you ask me about it again, I'll hunt you down and rip your face off.
Okay.
Great.
Good plan.
I won't ask you about it again.
I got the DVRs.
Actually, that's my lint.
My lint is oblong.
My lint is blue.
Okay!
Sounds like we've got a plan.
Let's get to training.
-  - Why does she want to meet with me?
You think our cover's blown?
I don't know, but, just to be safe, let's review your backstory.
I went to Yeshiva med school, residency at Mount Sinai, my best friend is Yacob Peralberg, and we share everything with each other.
Can't imagine that last part coming up, but okay.
You got this.
-  - Well, Isabel, your baby's head is the perfect size.
Oh, thank you, doctor.
Still gonna hurt when it comes out.
Get ready for that.
So you're Dr. Schwartz.
That's me.
L'chaim.
How can I help you?
I've been watching you ever since you showed up here.
You don't seem like the other doctors that we've had.
It's funny my best friend, Yacob, is always saying that.
- Oh.
- Cut the crap.
- We both know why I'm here.
- We do?
Your heart's beating a mile a minute.
It's not because I'm nervous!
Cortez says that you're sensitive.
I like that.
I've only been with cheating scum.
- Oh.
- Until now.
Ahh!
Everything okay in here?
- Yeah.
- We're all good.
- He was just checking me out.
- Mm-hmm.
And I will see you soon, doctor?
- Mm-hmm.
- Later.
Yeah.
Later.
Curse this perfect butt.
How dare you, sir?
Do you really think we would leak information on purpose?
No.
We think you're dum-dums and you did it by accident.
Oh.
Well, that's very possible.
Yeah, I could see that.
The briefing was a week ago.
Just tell us everyone you talked to since then.
Well, let's see.
On Saturday, I got together with my friends, and we went to the dog track.
We need names.
I lied.
There's not multiple friends.
It's just Scully.
Okay.
What about you, Scully?
Well, I went to the Knicks game with a buddy.
Was this "buddy" named Hitchcock?
Yes, and we weren't at the game.
We were at the dog track.
Oh, come on, guys.
Is there anyone you could've told the crime stats to?
- Crime stats?
- Wait.
Do either of you even know what our arrest numbers were?
- 12.
- No!
- Then no.
- Yeah, they're not the leak.
Come on, man.
Use your muscles.
Use my muscles?
Oh, great.
Why didn't I think about that?
Great advice, Terry.
You know what?
It's a pull-up.
There's not much to coach here.
So there's Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha, but New York City is really the fifth character.
Hmm.
What about Steve?
He seems nice.
Oh, Steve is nothing.
No one likes Steve.
"Steve is nothing".
Okay!
I don't get it.
Miranda could've had Blair Underwood, but she settled for Steve?
Oh, but you do get it, sir.
See, now you do.
How is you doing that helping me?
- Scully.
- Rosa.
Good job.
Can you do it without screaming?
Pro-bab-ly.
Then we're ready.
Let's break into the FBI.
Oh, come on, Captain.
This is such a big moment.
Say it with more gusto.
Indeed.
Like this: let's break into the FBI.
Oh, I see.
Let's break into the FBI.
No.
Let's break into the FBI.
Let's break into the FBI.
Let's break into the FBI.
Let's break into the FBI.
I feel like I'm doing it.
Let's break into the FBI.
Let's break into the FBI.
Okay!
I think we got it.
Now, let's break into the FBI!
Good morning.
- Hi.
This is for you.
- Thanks.
Quite a big package you've got there.
Oh, I apologize for the double entendre.
I can be such a Samantha.
Really?
You don't seem like a Samantha.
Well, I'm actually a combination of all four characters.
Both: Five if you count the city of New York.
- Yes.
-  Another Sex-and-the-Citiot?
Guilty as charged.
My favorite season has to be the third one.
Everything was going right for Carrie.
Her face was on every bus, her column was the talk of the town, and she met everyone's favorite furniture maker, Aidan Shaw.
Sure, she melted down when he tried to introduce her to his parents, and she flipped out when she bumped into Big getting out of that cab with Natasha, whom he had married.
Hmm.
Who can blame her?
They barely knew each other.
The best episode that year was episode six, entitled "Are We Sluts"?
You know the one.
Carrie was all in her head because she and Aidan weren't having sex.
Meanwhile, across town, Charlotte couldn't stop having sex.
And Samantha?
Samantha was just being Samantha.
The season finale that year was entitled "Cock-a-Doodle-Do".
Cock-a-doodle-doo.
Roger that.
Whoops.
I hate Big!
Carrie should've ended up with Mikhail Baryshnikov.
What?
He slapped her!
Are you insane?
Bingo.
Got the file.
Preparing for extraction.
No screaming, Peralta.
If you ask me, they never should've made the movie.
Abu Dhabi?
Abu don't bother.
Wow.
I'm gonna use that.
- Please do.
Have a nice day.
- Okay.
Hey.
Here you go.
Whoa, wait.
Hold on.
Stop.
Both of you.
That pass is only for the ninth floor.
All right.
Let me see that envelope.
Oh, actually, I can't show you that, because It's okay.
I asked him to come down and mail that.
I just need to put my return address on it.
And there you go.
Thanks.
I know just where to put that.
Oh!
There's Samantha again.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
We did it!
What?
I'm only human.
You can't always expect me to be the coolest guy ever.
Coolest guy ever?
Try telling that to Alan Greenspan.
Nice burn, Bob!
I should've known Maura wouldn't be able to control herself.
Strong women, they're just drawn to me.
You know, they're all right angles, and I'm nothing but curves.
This actually could be great, Boyle.
You could romance her into talking, but you shouldn't do anything that you're not comfortable with.
Oh, no.
No, I won't have to.
It's not gonna get physical.
You see, the art of seduction is all about making people wait.
- Right.
- Genevieve and I often begin our lovemaking sessions Oh.
Okay.
With hours upon hours of delicateness - Okay.
Please stop.
- That kind of blow Guard!
- You get it.
- All right.
Yeah.
All right.
Sexy playlist.
Check.
Seductive voice.
Double check.
-  - Hey, chipmunk.
- Let's do this.
- That sounds fun.
But first, I need to sign some charts, because I am a really good doctor.
Get that bubble butt over here.
Oh, I will!
Who is Genevieve?
No one!
My chiropractor.
- Then answer it.
- Answer it?
I mean, why don't we just stay in the moment?
Why are you such a slave to these little boxes?
Answer the phone, and put it on speaker.
-  - Hello?
Honey, the adoption papers went through!
You're gonna be a daddy!
Oh, my God!
I'm having a baby!
I mean this is the wrong number.
Don't call here again!
You're dead.
Maybe you're dead.
Please don't hurt me.
Sup, Sarge?
Just digging through the garbage like a normal person?
I'm trying to find out who our leak is.
What makes you so sure that there's a leak?
It might've just been that the reporter was really good at his job, like that hot blond surfer was at TMZ?
Maybe you leaked it.
Excuse me?
I'm not saying you did it on purpose.
Maybe you left the file on the subway.
I mean, you don't take your job very seriously.
Whoa.
We're about to have our first fight as a couple, Terrence.
First of all, I take my job very seriously.
That's why I'm here right now, helping you, and I'm the only one doing it.
Or, I was, until you insulted me.
Now watch me walk away.
I said watch me!
Wow.
No wonder Whealon wiped the database.
Look at this.
He quashed all FBI and NYPD operations relating to Figgis drug running, kidnapping, murder those are the best crimes; why would you quash them?
-  - Time for waiting is over.
Now is the time for groin-stomping.
Damn right, it is!
Let's go arrest that punk.
He says "punk" just like you.
Where do you think he learned it, punk?
NYPD!
- Somebody's been here.
- Look: a body!
- We got a body!
- Damn it!
He's dead.
Figgis got to him.
Wait a minute.
He's got a pulse.
No, wait.
That's my pulse.
No.
It's his pulse.
Nope, it's both our pulses.
He's alive!
I'm alive!
We're all alive!
This case just got busted wide open.
Good news.
The doctors say Whealon's not gonna die.
Thank God.
I just hope he's in a lot of pain.
They say he'll be out of the coma within 12 hours.
Great.
That means he'll definitely testify against Figgis, and you know what that means: time for celebration candy bars!
Stupid hospital vending machines didn't have alcohol for some weird reason.
Here.
Why not?
I really have embraced my wild side today.
As have I. Chocolate and nuts.
Actually, that's overkill.
Indeed.
I'll wait here, so I can interrogate him when he wakes up.
I'll keep you company.
Why don't you two go home and get some sleep?
Good idea, sir.
We'll head to the bar, get super drunk, and then head home and get some sleep.
Yeah.
Good idea, sir.
Turns out your sensitive doctor isn't who he says he is.
What?
What do you mean?
Why?
'Cause he's about to adopt a baby with his chiropractor.
Oh, thank God that you didn't invest more time in a relationship with that jerk.
Why can't I find a good man?
Could be because you're in prison for murder.
- Nah.
That's not it.
- Yeah, that's not it.
Before this, I used to date all my brother's friends from the mob.
All dogs too.
Never mind.
You don't want to hear about them.
No!
I do want to hear about them.
Please.
Tell me everything about them.
Thanks.
That would be nice.
Ahh!
Not a toucher.
Totally get it.
I'll keep my hands to myself.
What's going on, Sarge?
You find that leak yet?
Yes.
I'm hiding behind a coffeemaker, spying on everyone in this office, because I found the leak.
Aww, Terry.
Sarcasm is not a good look on you.
But you know what would be?
- A really tight Henley.
- Very helpful.
I know who your leak is.
What?
I looked up the reporter who published the crime numbers, and I noticed you two follow each other online.
He followed me, and you know I'm a proud member of team follow-back.
So I went through your feed to see what you were posting.
Lot of pictures of your kids.
Nobody cares.
And then I found this picture you posted last week.
"Living that #YOGURT life".
Embarrassing.
But what's even more embarrassing, Terry, is that the arrest numbers are in the photo, clear as day.
Oh, my God!
I was the leak!
I got to take that picture down.
Gina, I am so sorry I blamed you.
And I knew you would say something like that, so I went ahead and bought myself a cake on your behalf.
Check it out.
Oh, dang.
And this has been here for the last half-hour, detective.
Didn't even notice it.
God, I'm so sick of doing everyone's job for them.
It's like, help me out a little bit.
Just once in a blue moon.
Well, we did it.
For a second there, I didn't think we were going to pull it off.
- I knew we could.
- And we did.
To us!
Oh.
What are you guys celebrating?
Terry was mad at us, but we didn't know what he was talking about, and he went away.
- Huge day.
- Uh-huh.
It's Amy.
Hey, girlfriend.
Jake, Maury told me who Figgis has working for him in the FBI.
Yeah, I already know who it is, because I just caught him: Special Agent Ryan Whealon.
Also, I did one full pull-up.
I'm gonna be so buff when you get back.
Cool, babe.
Did you get the other guy?
- What other guy?
- Someone named Bob Anderson.
Bob?
Oh, my God.
Amy, I have to go.
- Bob is working for Figgis.
- What?
He must've been the one who deleted all those digital files.
And he tried to have Whealon killed.
But he helped us with the heist, and there was nothing about him in the paper file.
Yeah, because that wasn't the real file.
I just need to put my return address on it.
And there you go.
Oh, thank you.
We have to call Holt.
Come on, Captain.
Pick up.
Pick up.
Don't answer that, Raymond.
And now I'm going to have to kill you.
Oh, Bob.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
1 Come on, come on, Captain, pick up.
Your friend Bob is secretly working for Jimmy "the Butcher" Figgis.
This is a call you're gonna want to take.
Bob must've done something to him.
Or maybe they're talking about something super boring, like potatoes or beans.
White rice, brown rice those are just some of the rices I love.
- Mmm.
- Also basmati.
- Mmm.
- Uh, that's all of them now.
I should've known Agent Whealon was dirty.
There were signs.
He wore a V-neck once.
Bob.
You did nothing?
It's my greatest regret.
Well, at least he's still alive.
When he comes out of the coma, we'll get him to talk.
Would you mind getting us some food?
I can't fathom eating these candies that Peralta bought us.
Chocolate is the devil's carob.
And carob is Satan's raisin.
I'll go down to the cafeteria, see if I can't scare up some untoasted bread.
Yum.
Oh, Raymond.
I forgot my wallet in my Bob, you've killed him.
And now I'm going to have to kill you.
I've never been more shocked.
This is bad.
This is really bad.
Where would Bob have taken Holt?
I don't know, the library?
Or an index card factory?
Is there such a thing as an accounting museum?
- I - Hold on.
I got this.
I know the captain's "find my phone" password.
He's at the hospital.
He's still at the hospital.
You're a genius!
Well, I'd love to take credit, but the truth is, life just isn't that hard.
We got to get to the hospital, and we got to get there fast.
- Then I should drive.
- Why you?
I have nothing to live for, and I drive like it.
Okay, let's do it.
Jake called.
We need to get back to New York right now.
No, no, no, no, no.
You can't just leave.
We may need some of those contacts in the future.
You're gonna go say good-bye, and you're gonna mean it.
So while I'm happy the Supreme Court threw out my conviction, I'm also really sad to be leaving all of you.
Bethany, I know you're an arsonist, but now it's time to set the culinary world on fire.
Sheila, you have the voice of an angel.
Whoever your next music producer is, maybe don't stab him.
Jen, you're a Nazi.
We never really clicked.
Stay innocent, ladies.
No, no, no.
What happened?
He flatlined 20 minutes ago.
The two men who were in this room, where did they go?
I don't know.
-  - Okay, thanks.
Gina said Holt is still in the building.
But where?
I have to get into their heads.
Whew.
"Bob, what are you doing"?
"I'm breaking the law, Raymond, "because I'm the worst.
Now walk out of this room as if nothing is happening".
"You'll never get away with this, Bob.
"Jake is on his way.
He's a great cop, and he's going to save me".
"Really?
He seemed so immature".
"Yes, he seems that way, "but I know the real Jake.
"He's like a son to me.
"And when this is all through, we're going on a road trip together".
- Jake.
- Rosa, shh!
I'm working on the case right now.
That's weird.
There's a smudge on this sign right over the H. There's a smudge on this H too.
Oh, my God, why would you touch a hospital thing and then put it in your mouth?
It's chocolate.
Great instincts.
Never doubt yourself.
Holt is trying to send us a message using the candy bar I gave him.
Just act natural, Raymond.
Eat your candy bar.
I can't.
It's disgusting.
I don't care.
H is for Holt.
He's leading us right to him.
Now all we have to do is follow the trail of chocolate.
This this is why I became a cop.
Charles, what took so long?
I want to get out of this suit before we take off.
We're not going anywhere.
The flight is booked, and there's already a huge stand-by line.
What?
We have to get on that plane.
Were you stern?
Amy, you know I wasn't.
I've got this.
Holt's in danger, and that lady's in my way.
Never get between a teacher's pet and her teacher.
Ooh.
Okay, vest lady.
I don't care what you have to do Oh, you sweet thing, you're pregnant.
So pregnant.
- What a miracle, right?
- Oh.
Please give me special treatment.
I ripped her a new one, and guess what fell out.
Two tickets to New York.
- Ugh.
- First class upgrade.
Ahh.
No chocolate smudges in this entire parking garage.
Or on floors one through five.
We're officially lost the trail.
Unless No, that's not chocolate.
- What is that?
- What?
Don't eat it again!
Wait, getting a text.
- It's Captain Holt.
- Where is he?
What'd he say?
"Inib rue tiid".
Wait, I'm getting another one.
"Ink obrvs whiz".
These are nonsense.
He's been gagged.
How would that come through in a text, Scully?
Wait a minute.
I know what's going on.
He's secretly trying to text us from his pocket.
When I die, please give Kevin my regards.
What shall I tell him?
"Regards".
Scully, these look like the weird texts you always send.
Touch screen phones don't respond correctly to my fingers.
It's because I've been electrocuted so many times.
Hold on, I bet we can reverse engineer this thing.
Scully, type this into your phone.
"Inib rue tiid".
Two "I"s.
It came out, "Imm on rha rooj".
"I'm on the roof".
He's on the roof!
Oh, God bless you, Scully, and your weird, dead hands.
You and Hitchcock are killing it!
-  -  - Oh, my God.
- Let's just go.
Freeze!
Drop your weapon!
One more step, and I kill your captain.
Come on, Bob.
What are you doing up here?
Why are you on the roof?
Oh, my God.
You're gonna zip-line off of this thing like an American ninja.
That is such a cool escape plan.
Actually, I was gonna throw Raymond over the side and make it look like a bird-watching accident.
Oh, please, do you think anyone's gonna actually It's genius.
There's a red-tailed hawk roost a block away, and I've got a pair of micro binoculars in my pocket, like a fool.
Okay, well, I stand corrected.
Just drop the gun and surrender.
If you turn on Figgis, this doesn't have to end badly for you.
You still have that file with all the evidence against him?
You mean the one you handed me?
That was a good idea at the time; we all thought that.
Yes, that file's in a safe place, and you're never getting it.
Don't be foolish, Bob.
You're outnumbered.
Outnumbered, my bottom.
Figgis's men are on the way.
Yes, I called for backup.
Captain, down!
Oh-ho, Terry took you down!
Nice timing, Sarge.
How'd you know we were up here?
Captain marked the Hs in chocolate, which I instantly connected to the giant helipad H we're on right now.
Oh.
Cool.
Cool, yes, we also solved that.
Came straight up here to the roof.
We didn't wander around even for a second.
We're all smart.
Smart.
This is a good hiding space.
Scully, why are you lying down?
'Cause there was a bed here.
You took your shoes off.
All right, look, a bunch of sketchy, black SUVs just pulled up outside.
Either it's Figgis's guys, or BeyoncÃ© stubbed her toe.
Don't even joke about that, Jake.
That would be our new number one priority.
We have to call for backup.
Figgis has people in the NYPD and the FBI.
So good luck with that.
Wow, betraying the FBI is one thing, but sarcasm, Bob?
Wow.
All right, we're on our own.
We got to get Bob out of this hospital and to a secure location, someplace the NYPD doesn't know about.
Captain, you're a grown-up; let's just use your lake house.
For the last time, not all grown-ups have lake houses.
We can go to my apartment.
No one knows where I live.
I thought you had Amy over there once.
Yeah, it was fun.
I moved the next day.
Rosa's place it is.
Well, they know what Bob looks like, but they've never seen us.
They think we're just a big group of cops.
What if we didn't look like cops?
I'm from New York, I'm from New York I'm from, I'm from New York - I'm from New York - Yeah - I'm from -  Great, everyone looks fantastic, and our hats look normal.
Wow, Sarge, you are just stuffed into those scrubs.
How do you do it?
Exercise and diet.
It's not that hard.
Eh, seems pretty hard to me.
I don't think I'm gonna do that.
This brings back memories.
I loved playing doctor as a child.
The cancer has spread.
Get your house in order.
So we can sneak out like this, but what about Bob?
Not to worry.
I've got that covered.
Hitchcock.
And, yes, he is bound and gagged under there, but more importantly, you said, "What about Bob"?
That's the name of a movie.
Holt made a pop culture reference.
All right, let's go.
Okay, let's go over our exit strategy one more time.
Seat 2A is gonna need help with her bags.
She has twig arms.
So if she blocks us, I play the pregnancy card.
And remember, leave our luggage and Roll the dice with lost and found.
I know; I've been studying this map you drew on the barf bag for 40 minutes.
Sorry, working is the only thing keeping me from worrying about the squad and completely spiraling.
Hot towels?
For the billionth time, no!
We don't want your boiled rags!
No, thank you.
I don't know if it's keeping you from spiraling.
Look, why don't we just take our mind off everything?
We're in first class.
We get free movies.
What?
No.
We can't enjoy ourselves while the squad is in danger.
That's not fair.
Amy, we're trapped here for three hours.
There's nothing else we can do.
Fine, I'll watch a movie, but nothing we'll like too much.
- No new releases.
- Of course not.
We'll just put on whatever's first alphabetically.
"27 Dresses".
His cerebral blood circulation is infarcted.
Get me an ICP catheter, stat!
Wow, that was amazing, Sarge.
I watch a lot of "Grey's Anatomy".
That show's surprisingly accurate.
Yeah, the one episode I watched, there was a bomb in the guy's butt.
Oh, that's a good one.
He's crashing!
Push 10 ccs of corticosteroids, plus prep an ER for surgical decompression!
Look, I don't know what any of this means, but I feel like Sandra Oh.
Doctor, do you need me to start a line?
Oh, we're good.
You said he's crashing.
Here's a syringe.
Oh, good, I'll use this to puncture his skin.
Uh-oh, we got company.
Uh, this man has a bomb in his butt!
We got to go.
Code silver, code silver.
-  - Split up.
-  - You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just so into the movie, you know, really worried about Katherine Heigl and her dressmaking business.
I'm sorry, dressmaking business?
Her architecture firm?
- Her cupcake bakery.
-  The magazine she edits?
Jane is the executive assistant to an outdoor lifestyle entrepreneur.
You're not even watching!
I'm sorry.
I can't focus.
I'm spiraling.
Ugh, I knew it.
If "27 Dresses" doesn't distract you, nothing will, nothing will.
So what do we do?
We're gonna embrace the spiral.
We're gonna talk about these fears.
Things are about to get real.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yes?
We're gonna need a box of tissues and some cozy blankets.
- Okay.
- Oh, one more thing.
- Mm-hmm?
- Y'all got sundaes?
-  - Oof!
Nice.
Bedpan to the face.
That's what this is?
Ugh, I put my hands in it.
Figgis' men are everywhere, and now there's hospital security at all the exits.
- How are we gonna escape?
- Relax.
There's a million ways to get out of a hospital unnoticed.
Name one.
- Dress up like babies.
- What?
Well, you put me on the spot.
Well, you brought it up.
All right, wait, wait, wait.
I've got a real plan.
-  - Hey!
Go right!
Go right!
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
Abandon gurney!
Abandon gurney!
Damn it!
It's not Bob.
Code silver.
Can't let you out.
Look, you have to help me.
I'm an FBI agent.
I am Serena Williams.
I'm sorry.
They both suffer from grandiose delusional disorder.
GDD.
I've been taken hostage here.
And I'm supposed to be at Wimbledon.
It's my serve!
No, no, no, I am not crazy.
Yes, he is, deeply.
We need to transfer them both to a secure psychiatric facility.
Serena here just bit off a doctor's nose.
It tasted delicious.
Yeah, you can go.
No, no, call the FBI.
No, call Venus!
Call Venus!
Have a seat, Bob.
Wow, Rosa.
This is how you live?
What were you expecting?
I don't know, rock walls, weapons everywhere, a waterfall for a door I guess I was just picturing the Batcave.
Why do you need a vase full of lemons?
The room needed a pop of color.
Who are you?
All right, Bob, it's time to tell us where that file is.
And why would I do that?
Because we are your only chance of getting out of this.
You have tons of evidence on Figgis, which means he's probably gonna kill you.
If you turn on him, we can get you into witness protection.
You'll get a nice, little house somewhere in Florida.
I think you'd love Florida, Bob.
I've never actually been there, but Pitbull's videos make it seem muy caliente.
I know Figgis, and you're in far more danger than I. He's coming for you.
And I guarantee his soldiers find this place.
Not gonna happen.
I rent it out under a shell corporation.
Yeah.
My mail goes to a P.O. box in Queens.
Yeah.
My neighbors think my name is Emily Goldfinch.
Oh, yeah.
People I work with all think my name is Rosa Diaz.
- Yeah wait, what?
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.
- Enough.
I'm gonna get this punk to talk.
Oh, Bob, you are S'ed in the B. I can't lose Holt.
I've barely scratched the surface of the amount of approval I need from him.
Can I have your cherry?
Oh, get in there, girl.
And Jake I haven't seen him in weeks, and it's been so hard.
I love him so much.
Oh, my God.
I've said "I love you" to him before, but I've never added "so much".
What if I never get to say "so much"?
What about me?
What if something happens to Jake, and he never gets to meet my baby?
I don't want to hang out with some stupid baby who's never met Jake.
Excuse me.
Two more sundaes.
Oh, we've already begun our descent, so we've suspended our food services.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are we still in coach?
Or are we in first class where the rules don't apply?
Charles, it's okay.
We're about to land.
You got me through the spiral.
Oh, my God, you're right.
We did it.
I am so sorry we yelled at you.
But we will take those sundaes to go.
And I don't care if you don't have a lid.
Y'all make a lid.
All right, here we go.
Captain's about to lay into him.
You need to tell me where the file is.
I'm sorry, Ray.
I'd rather not.
Okay, not the dynamic start I wanted, but I'm sure he's just getting warmed up.
I'd prefer not to ask you again.
You sound desperate.
I'm under your skin.
The only things under my skin are oil glands, hair bulbs, nerve fibers, blood vessels, and a bit of fatty tissue.
You forgot about Ruffini's corpuscle.
Oh, my God, you're rattled.
Checkmate.
I don't think that was as vicious a burn as he thinks.
You beat me.
It's over.
I've lost all authority.
Who's next?
All right, Bob.
You want to play hardball?
Good.
Word on the street is, you like jazz.
I don't just like jazz; I'm fond of it.
I don't understand the difference.
Tell me where the file is right now, or I will ruin jazz for you forever.
I'd like to see you try.
Wrong choice, daddy-o.
Skeeba-dee-skop-gop, boo-ba-roppin jazz Jazzity-jazz, joozle jazz Jizz jang jingle jazz What are you gonna tell your kids, man?
That their daddy's a crook?
I don't have any kids.
My whole thing was based on you having kids!
Now all of this is gonna be hypothetical.
No tools, Diaz.
All right, mister, here are five stories about my cousin Lee-Ann and her alleged Lyme disease.
How's that gonna make me talk?
Not everything's about you, Bob.
I just needed to vent.
God, you're such a Lee-Ann.
All right, listen up, buddy.
You're gonna tell us where it is.
And also what it is.
We're a little unclear what we're after.
Zwee-bop, zwee-bob, Bob and the mob Mob-mob-mob Bob-Bob-Bob No swords.
So she's gonna look up at you, with hypothetical tears in her hypothetical eyes, and ask why all the other hypothetical daddies came in for career day.
I can't.
I can't.
So it's like, "Yeah, maybe you're tired all the time "because you're sick, Lee-Ann, or maybe you're depressed because you live in Reno".
Ta-ta, ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, dibbity-doo Cymbal-cymbal-cymbal-cymbal cymbal-cymbal What just happened?
Somebody cut the power.
Time's up.
Looks like Figgis found you.
Okay, door's secure.
That's the last of the candles.
Is that multi-wick?
Am I smelling basil and tangerine?
It's called "Summer's Kiss".
What the hell is going on with you?
I hate to rub it in, detectives, but I told you they'd find me.
Sniper!
Everybody down!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Wrong guy!
Wrong guy!
- Bob!
Stay away from the windows!
Captain, table!
Oh, my God.
What's going on?
They tried to kill me.
-  - Argh!
We have to get out of here, and we have to get out of here now.
It's cool.
I have a panic room.
Yes!
There's the Rosa I know.
"Summer's Kiss" my ass.
But it won't fit all of us.
Well, looks like Bob's the odd man out.
- Bye, Bob.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
You have to take me with you.
They'll kill me.
Look, I'll talk.
The file is in a safe deposit box.
The keys are in my car in the lining of my trunk.
All right, fine.
Take Bob with you into the panic room.
Rosa and I'll find another way out.
I'm sure you will, son.
You called me "son".
No take-backs.
How will I know to open the door?
When you hear me knock the "Funky Cold Medina".
I don't know what the "Funky Cold Medina" is.
Even context clues have failed me.
All right, you'll know it's me.
Why'd you do it, Bob?
Why'd you betray everything you ever stood for?
I spent 14 years bringing down a Mexican cartel.
You know what they gave me for it?
A letter of commendation with my last name misspelled.
In all fairness, Bob, who spells "Anderson" with three Ns?
Regardless, I figured if they're not gonna give me any respect, I might as well get paid.
Was it worth it?
Of course.
I made millions.
I traveled the world.
I've eaten whale.
I always assumed whale would be too fatty.
Well, I don't have to assume.
I know for a fact it is.
It's disgusting.
I threw up.
That sounds funky.
Must be Jake.
What's going on?
Ha-ha, we fooled you, you fool!
I was gonna do something cooler, but then I was just like, "Go with what you feel".
Who are these people?
Oh, well, this is my best friend, Charles, and this is my girlfriend, Amy.
She's not really pregnant.
We're taking things slow, but it's going really good.
- Jake?
- Right.
They arrived about an hour ago.
Sir, I'm gonna need you to cut the power for Rosa Diaz in apartment 410.
- 410 is Emily Goldfinch.
- Who?
Curly black hair, always smiling, a little chatty for my taste.
I have so many questions, but there's no time.
Cut the power.
The sniper was Charles Bang.
And Rosa.
And while you were cowering in the panic room, I went and got this file to make sure you weren't lying.
Well, what happened in here?
It looks like there was a fight.
Oh, it was me.
I was done with this place the minute you all stepped foot in it.
Oops.
Guess you should have taken our witness protection offer and gone to Florida, Bob.
We have more than enough evidence to take you and Figgis down.
You've been played, Bob.
It was all a ruse.
You don't work with Jake Peralta for three years without knowing what the "Funky Cold Medina" is.
Aw, hell yeah.
I asked the guy, "Why you so fly"?
He said, "Funky Cold Medina".
Both: Funky Cold Medina.
Zero rehearsal.
I just got off the phone with the DOJ.
They've arrested over 75 of Figgis's men.
His operation is decimated.
Did they find Figgis?
Not yet, but they're confident they will.
And when they do, Detective Pimento can come home.
Can't wait.
I'm gonna eat his face off.
You guys are so cute.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Even when Bob held that gun to my head, I was not afraid, because I knew you were on the case.
I respect the hell out of each and every one of you.
Nine-Nine.
All: Nine-Nine.
Love it when everyone chants that.
Mm.
So Charles and I really got into it on the plane, and around sundae number five, I realized we should move in together.
You and Charles?
No, you and me.
Oh!
Yes, that makes so much more sense.
Absolutely, immediately, let's do that.
I love you so much.
Aw, I love you so much too.
I love this so much.
So I guess Charles was listening to our conversation.
Both: Yeah.
Ooh, I'm gonna get this.
- Hello?
- Jake Peralta?
This is Jimmy Figgis.
Oh, uh, hey, dog.
You and Ray Holt took down my operation.
Now I'm gonna kill you both.
Later, dog.
Uh, Captain Holt?
Blue skies smiling at me Nothing but blue skies Do I see Morning, Greg.
Morning, Larry.
Bluebirds singing a song Nothing but bluebirds All day long
