Hmm.
Never heard of that one.

But whatever you did, it worked.
Because Brandt and Dustin obviously  think you're, like, so fine this year.
No, they don't.
You guys  - They're totally into you.

Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry,  but, like, here comes Brandt.

OK, just throw it.
Stop!
Stop.
Stop!
Lying in your arms   So close together   Didn't know just what I had   But then again, there's  Dustin.
He's fly.
Now I toss and turn   Cause I   His earring is so hot.
- Yeah, I know.
-  He is so cute.
And then there's him.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la   Earth to Blondie!
Batter up!
- Sorry.
- Anna, that's you.
Oh, my God, go.
Go, Na!
You got this.
Kick it, Na!
Kick it.
Kick it!
-   -    Man down.
Everybody, sit down.
Hey, you!
Take your victim to the nurse.
I'm really, really,  really, really sorry.
It's chill.
Um, it's crazy, though,  because you don't even look  bad with blood on your face.
Um, do you know my friend Maya?
Nah.
Oh, my God, that that's crazy.
That's her nickname for me.
Na.
Um, she's my best friend.
She's amazing,  and actually two of your best  friends are, like, in love with her.
So it's like, how do you pick, you know,  'cause, like, I've only ever  been in love with one person.
Brandt's nice, but you  know, Dustin has an earring.
Dustin's a bitch.
- Dustin is a bitch?
-   Dustin is a bitch.
A bitch?
-  That's what Alex said.
- Oh, my God.
Yeah, so I really think that  you should just go with Brandt.
I mean, obviously,  whatever you wanna do.
But do you really  wanna do with the bitch  that doesn't hang out with Alex?
I don't know.
Maybe being with  a bitch is the best thing for me.
Look, I like his earring.
Shit.
Can't believe they're not  friends.
They're not best friends?
Yeah, I mean, obviously, not anymore.
That is crazy.
OK.
Well, then I don't  wanna be with him.
I don't.
I only wanna be with someone  who's best friends with Alex,  'cause I wanna be in the same room  with you for our first fingers.
Like, I'm not gonna do without you.
Seriously, like, I'm  gonna go with Brandt.
Quiet, please.
Settle down.
Young sir in the Care Bear sweatshirt.
Huh?
- She's a girl.
-   Yeah, I'm a girl.
Care to share something  you did over the summer?
Come up to the front.
Um  I guess, like, the most memorable  thing I did over this summer was  I watched Ace Ventura: Pet Detective  like six times in a row.
And it is, like,  really funny.
'Cause he does, like, all this like,  rewind, like, fast  forward stuff, like  I'll just do it.
It's like  "I really wanna play,  Coach.
Just give me a chance.
Let's see that in instant slow-mo".
Really makes me laugh.
And he does this other  thing, where he's like  Ahhh!
Sit down.
Enough of that.
OK.
Everyone, take out  your summer reading,  and get into groups of four.
Uh, John, Lydia, Jafeer  OK, so, what do you think about  this if I give that to Brandt?
Um, it could go like this.
Look, I feel  like it needs a question.
OK.
Yeah, I know.
You're right.
And then put my name, 'cause  he won't know who it is.
Perfect.
So exciting.
OK, Brandt.
I'm gonna, like, have  my first boyfriend.
No doubt.
That's freaking crazy.
It's amazing, and we'll go on,  like, double dates and stuff.
I know, with, like, Alex.
I mean, if he wants to.
Dustin says yes.
Dustin says yes.
- Brandt says yes.
- I do not say yes.
- Yes, he does.
- No, I do not.
-  Yes, he does.
-  No, I do not.
Oh, my God, wait.
Dustin, that is, like,  so presumptuous to think  that she's asking you.
She asked him.
You guys, stop.
This is, like, so mean.
Just tell her.
U-G-I-S, biyatch!
- UGIS.
- UGIS.
Wait, what?
Oh, honey, don't you know?
It means ugliest girl in school.
UGIS!
They're so mean.
And they said they don't know  why you are wearing a bra, Anna,  'cause there's nothing to go in it.
I'm so sorry.
It's cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, this is really funny.
UGIS!
UGIS!
- Thanks for telling me, Becca.
-  You're welcome.
- OK.
- Bye.
Bye.
It's not they like my haircut.
They're assholes.
No.
They were right.
- I am ugly.
I'm a freaking freak.
- No, you're not.
Like   I'm UGIS.
Maya, if UGIS means beautiful unicorn,  then yeah, you you you're  UGIS.
Then, yeah, you are.
No.
Na, do you understand, like,  I'm the ugliest girl in school.
You get that in your skull?
Like, to love me is the biggest insult.
Like, that's what it means.
Then I guess, you know, I've  been insulted the greatest.
I'm desperate for changing   Starving for truth   I'm closer to where I started   Chasing after you   I'm falling even  more in love with you   Letting go of all I've held onto   You literally look, like, hot right now.
You know, none of this  actually makes any sense.
I know.
Like Terra Newback?
It's a  hunchback for Pete's sake.
Yeah, I know.
Or freaking  Cindy Puchak like?
Her mole covers her whole neck.
It's the size of my  face, like, it's bigger.
And like, think about Beth Mahoney.
Beth Mahoney is freaking busted like  - She's UGIS.
- She's so UGIS.
- Like I'm UGIS?
- You're not UGIS.
- Hey, UGIS.
- Go fuck your mom.
They're all a bunch of fuckers.
We just have to do something about this.
Anna, I can't.
I have an idea.
Do you know where the  eighth graders sit?
You shouldn't be here.
- Get out of here, freaks.
- OK.
-  Fucking leave.
- We should go.
Shuji, no.
It's important.
Stop.
Um  They were these boys in our grade,  who were not kind to  - I need you to beat them up, Shuji.
- Yeah.
Like, it just needs to happen.
Why should I?
See.
Like I told you he wouldn't care.
This is literally, like,  the worst day of my life,  and he'll probably call me UGIS, too.
Did you just say UGIS?
Yeah.
UGIS is the worst  thing you can be called.
The list of UGIS's past,  they're all heinous dogs.
There's a list?
Look, I'm not gonna  beat up a seventh grader,  but I can teach you some words.
Um, what do they look like?
Um.
Well, like, um  Brandt, he, like, has this,  like, chestnut silky hair,  and it's like, he has brown honeydew  No, what are his bad features?
Oh.
Um  - I think he's like, he's, like, short.
- Mm-hmm.
- That's true.
- Yeah.
That's good.
-  Is that good?
- Mm-hmm.
- And like, Stacy Davis told me that  - Oh, yeah.
she gave me a handy  when his dad was sick  to help make him feel better,  and she said he's not circumcised,  and it looks like an aardvark.
That's what she said.
OK, for sure, you're gonna  wanna bring up the aardvark dick.
- OK.
- OK, this is what you're gonna say.
Hey, you porcupine midget piece of shit,  I would never touch that  aardvark dick with a 10-foot pole,  so suck it, bitch.
You got it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
- That was great.
- OK.
All right.
- OK.
- Don't  Come on.
You guys.

After school, I'm gonna  bitch out Brandt and Dustin.

Fuck you!
-   - Oh, my God, my mom!
- Go!
Go!
- Maya  It's OK.
Did I go too far today?
I mean, like, it was  definitely, like, intense.
I probably shouldn't have  said that about his dad.
Yeah.
I mean, it was crazy.
But, like, his dad did die.
It's just a fact.
Oh, wait, Na.

OK.
Ojichan, why are you haunting Maya?
Oh, my God.

S-T  - S-T  U  R-B  Whoa!
That is crazy, Ojichan.
Why did you just flick it?

We're in the middle of contacting him.
- I didn't flick it.
I didn't.
- What the hell?
You guys are playing Ouija?
We're not playing, it's serious, so  That shit's so stupid.
You realize one of you is just moving it  and it's just your subconscious, right?
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I need to tell you my subconscious.
OK.
I'm like Sam  only I'm grosser, 'cause I'm a girl,  and I'm a pervert.
And I really shouldn't  be doing what I'm doing.
I've been putting my  hands down my pants, um  my area  down there to feel good.
Um, when I'm in bed  sometimes I put my hands  between my legs to feel good.
Really?
Yeah.
Hey, you mean like this?
Not exactly, um, sort of.
You don't feel gross?
How gross can I feel if you do it, too?
Promise I'm not a pervert.
I promise.
And swear you won't tell anyone.
- Oh, my God.
I swear.
You swear, too?
- I swear.
Yeah.
- Pinky swear.
- Pinky swear.
Oh, is this about me drinking  Sweet!
Sweet, I see.

1     Maya, Shuji, fax       Dear family   arrived in Cleveland today.
The weather is cold, but  my drumsticks are on fire!
How are you all?
Miss you very much.
Love, Dad.
Dear Dad, I miss you so much.
Yesterday I scored a goal at soccer.
I wasn't ready.
I was right there with you.
Get it, Alice.
Dear Maya.
I wish I could've  been there to see your goal.
I'm not surprised though,  I was quite the athlete myself.
Must be in the genes!
How's Anna?
Are you making any new friends?
Dear Dad, Anna's still  my best friend,  but my impression of Jim  Carey is getting really good  and there are at least four popular  kids that want to be our BF's,  "Best friends" now.
I'm also starting to sleep  in my own bed more.
Ask Mom.
Actually don't.
Dear Maya.
That sounds nice.
I miss  sleeping in the bed with your mom.
It's lonely out on the road sometimes.
We've all got our ways  of dealing with it.
For me, it's reading your letters.
So, please keep sending!
Love, Dad.
I   I am hiding   The you I show to you   Is just a lie   You take what you want   You get what you take   The high, high, high     What?
Alex broke up with Heather.
Hmm-hmm.
Hmm-hmm.
Are you losing your mind?
- It's all happening.
-  It's all happening.
This is the moment.
Oh, my God.
All right,  everybody, take your seats, please.
- I have some very exciting news.
- Alex Nolan is single.
I mean, like, if you're a girl  that's more exciting maybe.
Just like, you know the whole  school's talking about it.
I'm not weird, you guys are weird.
OK.
This Friday is Trailview Middle's  "Night of Amazing Music"  which means the band and the chorus  will be performing for the whole school.
And what's more, you  all will be performing  an original piece of music,  written by yours truly.
You'll find the music on your stands.
Na, I only have three notes solo.
How many do you have?
I have, like a five-measure solo.
All right,  let's try the piece.
Shall we?
One, two, three     All right,  hol Just hold it.
- Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.
-   Timpani.
I I don't know  what that is you're playing  but you should be playing a  straight 4/4 count in time.
Yeah, sorry.
Do you mean  the snare 'cause I feel like  - Timpani was doing four, four.
- No, Timpani No, the snare is fine.
Try to stay within the four, four times.
Do you want me to do it differently?
- 'Cause I was doing a four, four.
- So No, right.
Somewhere in there.
I'll tell you what.
Play it like your dad.
Why don't we  try it from the top again.
Do you wanna watch me practice  for my chorus solo audition later?
I mean, I would,  but I have enough on my plate  with that three notes solo,  you know what I mean?
- But you're the best singer I know, so.
- Yeah.
Do you think Alex is gonna  come to the show later?
- Yeah, it's kind of Oh, my God.
-  Hey.
- Hey.
- I'm, uh, I'm Brendan.
- I'm Anna.
-  I know who you are.
We're in band together.
I mean, anyone who does  music at Trailview knows you.
Really?
Are you excited for the  "Night of Amazing Music"?
Sure.
I am, yeah.
- What Are you Maya?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna get a new  hat after school for it.
- Are you allowed to do that?
- I'll do what I want.
OK.
Good.
- Oh, my God!
-       -  Where?
-  Um  -   -  After you've build the deck.
-  Yeah?
-  Yeah.
- Why not?
-  I don't know.
- What's the question?
-  The question is  - I forgot the question.
- The question is  When you've build the deck.
-  Question and the answer is  -  Pretty anemones.
Loving you   Makes me feel free   'Cause at the end of the day   You're my Mister May   You're my Mister June,  July and August   August, baby every month  you are to me   And we have a family       Oh, my God!
Fax is coming in.
It's to me.
Dear Maya   haven't heard from you in  a couple of days.
Can't wait to be  done with this tour and get back home.
What's the good word.
M-cat?
Love Dad.
Dear Dad  guess what?

Mom!
Ah.
- Oh my God, Dad!
- What?
-   -  What?
I have one good eye left, OK?
I'll protect you from this one.
I don't think it's funny.
Look, Mom, I am Dad and I'm  12 feet away from the flame.
That's not what I did.
- That is what you did.
You're like  -  That's not what I did.
It's so far away.
-  OK.
- That's immature.
Oh, you think  so?
Don't you dare.

I wouldn't miss this for the world.
I'm coming home early from the tour,  so, I can see my little girl's show.
I am so proud.
See you soon!
Love, Dad.
Very good.
Excellent.
All right, hold it.
Hold it, hold it.
Hold it, hold it.

Can you help me after school?
I have chorus practice.
I would, but  - Or maybe Sam can help.
Sam?
- No, don't ask him.
Stop  -  Sorry, he's already here.
- Fuck you, Anna.
Can you help Maya?

I broke up with her.
I don't have one anymore.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
It's chill.
What did you hate about her?
She was just, like, always there.
If I was your boyfriend,  I mean, girlfriend  I would not be anywhere,  unless you wanted me to be somewhere.
And then I'd be there on time.
Cool.
It's crazy there's this, um  like, kind of music concert  thingy tomorrow night  - so  - Cool.
- And I'm in, like the band and chorus.
- Nice.
I barely have time for a  boyfriend, but I do have a little.
Are you gonna go, or  Well, I I think we have to go.
Like, hate that thing.
Let's focus on the basics, all right?
Let's start with your breath.

Maya, just  - Come on, calm down.
- I am calm, Dad.
I'm just trying to play for you,  so, can you, like, stop.
Don't look at me like that.
It's gonna mess me up.
Look away.
Don't look at the drum, literally  look at that wall over there,  and listen.
Dad!
OK.
All right, all right,  I I got to stop you.
- Oh, my God!
- You are holding the mallets wrong.
- You know, let me show you.
- Dad, this is why  - I didn't want to do this with you.
- If you can't play for me  how you gonna play for everyone else.
I don't know because not  everyone's in, like,  a professional Steely Dan  Cover Band, Dad!
And they never will be if they  don't know how to practice!
Oh, no!
Now, I'm gonna suck  tomorrow night 'cause of you.
Oh, fine.
It's all because of me.
- Get out!
- Fine.
I I looked at your wrong.
Yeah, you did.
You know, Anna goes first today.
Hi, Ma.
I got you some  ginger ale to settle your tum.
What are you doing?
You shouldn't look at the crowd.
It's just gonna make you more nervous.
You're right.
Anna, your parents are here.
-  Together?
-  Yeah.
Oh, my God.
That is so embarrassing.
Alex.
Six o'clock.
Oh, no, I don't know what  o'clock is.

- So, it wasn't amazing?
-  It was.
I I don't think it fit with the  With the rest of the show, but  - Uh  - Thanks.
It was amazing.
You know I only made up that  solo to impress you, right?
That I was only supposed  to play three notes.
You you don't have to come up  with some fancy solo to impress me.
In music  every single note is important.
I would be proud of you  with just playing those three notes.
Are we OK?
Yeah.
-  Hi.
Sorry.
- Hey.
Uh  No, no, it's OK.

I don't know, like  You really like The Exorcist.
- Hi.
Hey.
- Hey.
- How was I?
- Oh, my God.
That was crazy.
- Oh, did you find Alex?
- Hmm-hmm.
- And?
- Can't really talk about it.
Oh!
Sometimes love means  um, ignoring someone for years.
- That's a 100% true.
-  Yeah.
Um, can you look at this for me?
What is it?
- Nothing, it's  - Back off.
He did it a  little bigger this time.
I guess he like loves me or whatever.
What are you gonna say?
Which one should I say?
-  I have a boyfriend!
We do!
-  We have a boyfriend!
Dear Maya  it's tough having to  get back on the road  but your performance inspired me.
We've got a pretty big gig in Florida.
Had my own solo and it  brought down the house!
Wish you could've seen me.
Love, Dad.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Wait, look, look.
- Mr. O's underwear sticking out.
- Oh, my God!
I would like put my  head in the butt part  and I would wear it on my  face as a mask to fall asleep.
All right, settle down,  settle down, people.
All right, it's Monday.
We got a lot to get through.
But first and foremost is signing up  for your mandatory  community service project.
More like community suck-vice.
I doubt that you will be saying that  when you hear these  extremely cool options.
OK, Sam's dad is delivering  meals to the homeless.
PB-n-J making party at my house!
Yeah all right.
There's a river trash pick up.
- You can scrape gum off the bridge.
- That one.
And finally, Heather's mom  is hosting a fashion show  at the nursing home.
Huh?
Sign up sheets  are in the hallway.
OK, go now!
Go, go, go!
Calmly!
No running!
Maya Ishii-Peters, sign it!
No!
No, I'm getting in.
I got it,  I got it, I got it.
Guys, guys, stop it, stop it.
It's my mom, not yours, OK?
It's my mom.
Yes!
Yes!
Personal space.
- Is it your mom?
I don't think so.
- Maya, we're gonna be supermodels.
Litter and say bye to  nature as we know it.
Here.
Pass this around.
She's at that group.
Go ask her.
Spending time with the elderly  - can be so rewarding.
- Mm-hmm.
Whenever Heather and I  visit her grandma in the home,  I think to myself,  no one else even notices  these people besides us.
So true, you guys!
I mean, some of these  older people haven't been  noticed in 40, 50 years.
Yeah.
So let's fix that.
Now what turns heads more  than a big, beautiful hat?
Almost nothing.
Oh, my God.
That's so true.
Wow!
Luckily, I have my own  new line of hats  - Deb's Darling Designs.
- Aw!
- Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!
And each of you will be wearing one  of my creations as you walk the runway  with one of Franklin County's  most forgotten old people  Hey, um, why aren't you  in your boyfriend's group?
She can't leave her best friend.
Excuse me.
Can you please  go back to your own circle?
Go!
Anyway, as I was saying.
The actual fashion show is on Saturday,  but we'll have two  rehearsals before that  to make sure you're good at modeling.
The first rehearsal  is tomorrow afternoon.
Heather, don't speak over me, Sweety.
So, please.
This is essential.
Bring a professional photo  of yourself to the rehearsal.
Headshots at the mall after school  - so we get the best hats.
- Yay!
So where where  are you guys meeting at the  Should we meet at the  Orange Julius?
Or like  Oh, we actually already  have reservations.
Cool, so do we so  - Sorry.
- Yeah, I know we can't come either.
It's fine.
- Well, bye, you guys.
Whatever.
- Bye, see you guys tomorrow.
- I have a plan.
- OK, what?
There's a spot right near my house  and I feel like our pictures  will look exactly like theirs.
- Promise?
- I pinky promise.
So what's the plan?
Oh, you are still here?
Oh, my gosh, I knew yours  was gonna be beautiful.
Great.
Oh, so nice.
And you know, tomorrow,  our next rehearsal, you'll be  meeting your mature partners!
Won't that be fun?
Jeez!
OK These photos are just incredible.
So beautiful.
The zig-zaggy part is so cute  and so is your eye shadow.
- Oh, my God, you guys.
- Oh, my God.
I think your mothers  knew what they were doing,  they got you dressed up.
Oh, my God!
That lip-shade!
- Can I borrow that?
- Yes!
Anna, you look so pretty!
Aw.
Thanks.
Huh.
Anna, what what?
I don't  know what that is in your photo.
- That's a fan.
- It's a fan.
OK, you know normally if you want  that kind of the airbrush look,  you don't keep the fan in.
Um, thank you for the note.
I don't know what  you're doing here, Maya.
You know, you almost  look like you were missing  and I know you're not  because you're right there.
But I wouldn't even put that.
Honestly I wouldn't even  put that on a milk carton.
Thank you for the note.
So, Terra, you know, she  looks like she's from the 1800s.
But it's on modern paper  and that that matters.
I found that dress in the river.
OK, so let's go try out our outfits.
OK?
Yay!
I can basically see my  reflection in your lip-gloss.
- You look so cute!
- So shiny!
Oh, my God!
- Do you have any lip-gloss?
- What?
Thanks for letting me borrow  these shoes, Heather Feather.
Duh, babe.

- Heather's wearing a thong.
- Oh, my God, no way.
Yeah.
Do I recognize that  pink top, Miss Rebecca?
Um, yeah, Heather let me borrow it.
Um, Heather do you have a  pink tank that I could borrow?
Because I lost mine.
Um I'm sorry I'm not really allowed  to let people borrow my clothes.
You know, sometimes people lose them.
That's cool like we can  buy some 'cause we have  - Money.
- Money.
Yeah.
Um.
OK, you three  can can you come over  here for a second, doll?
- You three  - Yeah?
OK can you, um, look more like  the other girls with your outfits?
You know because I'd  like the outfits to be  more uniform to match the hats.
Uh-huh.
My hats can do a lot of work but  they can't, you know, do everything.
So, can we jus  There we go.
Like, just yeah.
- Like this?

A thong.
Please call it underwear, Mom.
Shut up, Sweety.
Everybody, stand up and  get in a circle please.
And whoever took Heather's thong  is going to put it in  the middle of the table  and no one will know because  we're going to just turn around,  close our eyes and hum  on the count of three.

So, Heather, you're gonna just have  to wear the panties you have on.
Guys, seriously,  this isn't funny anymore.
Like, if someone took Heather's thong,  - just say so.
- Yeah, you guys  It must have been Anna, Maya or Terra.
- What?
- What?
The Bible says no thongs.
Anna and Maya, you guys  were in the changing room  when all of us went to see  Grandma Mary's room on Monday.
That's probably when you  stole it, just admit it.
- That's insane, you're literally crazy.
- What?
Show me your underwear.
- OK, show you our underwear?
- Show me just the top.
Are you crazy?
- Oh, Maya, show her your underwear.
- OK, show your underwear.
Show me your underwear.
You guys, you guys, you guys,  this is getting really out of hand.
I agree and you're perverted.
Can we just let it go, Becca?
Let's do the show, let's do the show,  I'm really I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry you lost it.
Do you guys remember  it's about the hats?
Hello, welcome to the Hat Extravaganza.
Thank you so much for coming.
I realized a lot of you  were already here  so thank you for leaving your rooms.
Also I'd like to thank my pals from  my book club/wine club for being here.
So, please just enjoy yourself.
OK, here we go, let's get crazy.
Liar!
- She's gonna pull your pants down.
- Who?
Becca Becca's gonna  pull your pants down.
Oh, no, no, no, stop it.
What's wrong with you?
Come with me.
Come with me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God,  we got away with it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
We got away with it, Anna.
What are you talking  about, we got away with it?
I was embarrassed in front of  the entire retirement community.
- Oh, my God!
- Take off the thong.
We don't need it.
- No.
I'm keeping it.
- "No"?
- Anna, stop it, stop it.
- Take it off, take it off.
- Anna, stop it.
You're gonna break it.
- We're not stealers.
We're not steal  Stop!
Stop!
No!
Are you seriously serious?
You, like, burned my asshole.
I'm freaking seriously dead serious  'cause that thing was  ripping everybody apart.
You literally just,  like, ruined my life!
That thong ruined you.
- Damn it.
- And my vagina.
I have to say sometimes  things just don't  turn out like you planned them, right?
And I apologize for that.
You should be apologizing to me.
I literally can't talk to you right now  when you have an attitude like that.
Pu, can you please tell Anna that I'm  not speaking to her either right now?
Um, Pu, can you please tell Maya  that sometimes you have to  right your wrongs in life  or karma will get you which is  exactly what happened to me today?
- Thank you very much.
- You know what, Pu,  can you please tell Anna that I'd  like a karma to run me over  because she destroyed the one thing  that actually made me feel  pretty like a normal human.
- But you're pretty now.
- No, I am not.
What is this thing?
I mean I want one.
- We can't talk about it.
- You know, it's like pink  and it like, it's like, it has,  it's like a stretchy.
It wasn't ours.
Yeah, but when it was,  it was really amazing.
- See, you're overreacting right now.
- No, I'm not.
- Truly Tru Maya  - Anna  Truly your reaction is telling me  that it's good that we destroyed it.
That is literally the most  messed up thing you could ever say  because you weren't  ugliest girl in school, OK?
No, no, no, no, no, not to be corny,  but I gotta say this  All my life I would grow a year older  look back and think I was  prettier the year before  I never got to enjoy my beauty  but I kept obsessing  over it all the time.
I wish someone had told me when  I was younger that I was beautiful  because of who I was not what I had.
Is she choking?
"I am beautiful".
She's saying "I'm beautiful"  and I don't need things on my body  "to make me feel beautiful".
- You got that from that?
- Yeah.
Wow.
How's everybody holding up?
Pu?
Something magical just happened.
OK, Pu, stop it.
I get it!
OK?
Let go.
You know what to do.
- Maya?
- What?
I'm not abandoning you.
I'm just letting you go  and you're gonna be loved  just like I love you.
Bye.
Bye.
OK, let's go.
- Let's go.
- Are you OK?
Yeah.
- Proud of you.
- Yeah.
- Um, do I look OK?
- Yeah.
Do I?
Yeah, but it's what's  inside that counts, so  - Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.
- Right.
Pu?
Pu?
I forgot your grapes, OK?
Gonna get you some purples, OK?
Purples.
I'll be right back.

So, just to go over it, you guys,  so, we're the old Spice Girls  and we, like, can't sing or  dance 'cause we have osteoporosis  so, we need milk, so, that we  And then we drink and we get strong  and then we'd fight dance  OK.

Wait, why do I have to be the servant?
Because you're like different from us.

- So, wait, wait, wait.
So  In this video project,  you play a servant  and you're serving  all your white friends?
Hmm-hmm.
And she put a blanket  over Ojichan's shrine.
- You don't mess with Ojichan's shrine.
- I didn't.
- I just didn't want to scare them.
-  Oh, my God.
Why are you so ashamed  of being Japanese?
I'm not.
I'm like barely Japanese,  and I'm cool with it.
Guido is fucked up, too.
Watch your language.
Anna, you're more fucked  up for making her do that.
Mom?
Good job, racists.
as  a great beacon light of hope,  the greatest demonstration for freedom  in the history of our nation.
It came as a joyous daybreak  to end the long night  of their captivity.
"Brings attention  to reality that teenagers  are in denial about".
Oh, dude!
-  OK.
You're such an idiot.
-  Let's see it.
-  I got you.
I got you so good.
You do this every single time.
Dude, it's like it's two time.
-   -  It's not funny.
I get you every time.
It's always funny.
Can we help you?
No, can I help you?
we don't speak Japanese.
Me neither.
No!
God, you're paying for that.
Hi.
Um, is the principal here,  please.
It's important, please.
The principal isn't in right now.
Is there something I can help you.
Um, yeah, actually I  I've been noticing some, um  racism in society  and I'd like to report it.
OK, kiddo.
- Oh, Principal Ravage.
- Ah.
Um, I just have a quick thought for you.
- Um  - Yeah, uh-huh.
Sure.
What?
Um, I've been noticing a bit  of a pattern in this school  - which is, um  - Mm-hmm.
Um, racism.
And also separate se-segregation.
And I just think it needs fixings, so  Uh-huh.
Well, thank you for  bringing this to my attention,  Anna, but I can't tell kids  who to spend time with.
And I hear that.
I really do, but  actually asked Jeeves  last night for some ideas.
And I'm thinking of like a demonstration  or something you know, like  they do organize drunk driving scenes  to show kids, like why  not to drink and drive,  I'm thinking we can do  like the same thing.
Uh, you know what?
I hear you,  but these tend to work themselves out.
Sometimes they don't and  you need a demonstration.
OK.
- Great.
-   I guess it's up to me, you dick.
Wake up!
So, it'll just be kind of a favor,  um, and it wouldn't interfere with  drama rehearsal after school at all.
It'd actually be like  now-ish.
Um  So, yeah?
Just see, you think  of this as a script  and if you're him  Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi!
- Hey, darling.
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm OK.
I don't know, I'm just a little like  - blah, after last night.
- Yeah.
I know what you mean, it was crazy.
- Yeah, it was just weird.
- It's kind of eye-opening for me.
- Yeah, yeah.
- And I'm sorry.
And I got a little  something for you later.
What do you have?
-  OK, party people  - A surprise?
today we're talking about  the late Thomas Jefferson.
What do we know about the great TJ?
Yes.
Yeah, he's dead.
That is true.
OK.
Yes.
Gabe again.
Uh, he loves grilled bananas.
I don't think that's true, Gabe.
Bless you.
You don't know what I know.
OK, I do know that he  was a Founding Father.
What  He was a disgusting slave owner.
Maya is Japanese.
That's so weird.
Yeah, that is weird.
I bet she eats  I bet she eats all kinds of gross foods.
Fish-heads.
Ew!
No, I don't.
And this, you guys has  been an example of racism.
And I would just like  everybody to acknowledge that  - and I see that happen in our school  - I am Japanese.
So, um, where was I?
- I was just saying that in America  - Maya, me love you long time!
-  You sound Jamaican  -  OK.
That's not part of this.
Hey, Lucy Liu,  can I get a $5 hand-job?
You're Japanese?
No shit, Maya,  I'm American.
- Her eyes are always closed.
-  Hey, hey,  what's going on here?
Everyone, everyone,  get back to your classes.
What's going on?
Someone put this on my locker.
Who is responsible for this?
Well, it's  Seriously?
Oh, Miss Kone,  come on, come on.
We're going to wait in  here till Mr. Ravage comes.
- Maya, it was  - We're going to have to call  your parents, you know,  that was a hate crime.
Come on, come on, get in there.
Be quiet and sit down.
I thought they were friends.
Anna.
- Kone.
- Mom.
She is my best friend  and her name is Maya  and just so you know  the only reason I did that  was to bring attention because  Becca and Stevie and Connie  were treating her differently.
All right.
Let's not point  the finger, all right?
This is about you and all this racism.
Honey, I taught you this, no?
- I'm disappointed.
-  That's what I'm trying to say.
I'm trying to  bring attention to the issue.
Don't be a know it all.
You're 13.
I I think, uh, some  major apologizing is in order.
See, this is why she doesn't  take anything seriously.
- Why?
- You just want her to apologize  go through the motions of apologizing  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,  and then you're gonna go home  and you'll watch The Simpsons  with her later.
- The point is, then she doesn't learn,  - What's wrong with The Simpsons?
to take it seriously.
Jesus fucking Christ, Curtis.
- Mom, we're in school, you can't say  - Who gives a fuck?
OK, uh, I wanna thank you both  so much for coming down here today.
And as for you, Miss Kone,  I will see you in detention.
-   -   I'm not eating.
I'm not eating until racism is over.
You're going on a hunger  strike like Gandhi?
- What?
-  Oh, for heaven sakes.
Geez, dummy.
What happened?
Nothing.
Come on.
Lets' go.
Here you all go.
You know what?
Take a nice long look at yourself,  and your bigotry.
It's your problem.
Anybody else, anybody  else wanna test me?
- Boom, bitch.
- Suck my pubes, bitch.
- Yo, what up, Shuji?
-  What's up?
What's up, Shuj?
Um, welcome to the park.
Yo, this is my sister, Maya.
Yo, what up, Maya?
What's up, Evan?
- Let's sit down.
- So  Some fucked up shit  happened to her today.
Someone wrote "I'm Japanese"  on her locker  and a bunch of kids  called her a dirty Jap.
Yo, that's fucked up.
This is Andy Kim.
He's in my grade.
What's up?
Yo, you're trying to hit this, though?
- This tree is hella tight, dawg.
- Yeah, let's do it.
Yo, Maya, you wanna hit this?
- Hey, yo!
- No, wait.
I'm just kidding.
- Hey, yo, she never hit a pipe though.
-  Yes, I have.
Like freaking dank faded all the time.
Oh!
Um, you know what?
On  second thought I feel like  I normally would, but I just,  during school, like shouldn't.
- You know?
- Staying sober for school.
I respect that.
-  Uh, Shuji, you wanna hit this?
-  Yeah.
All right.
Oh, God.
Hey, Koney.
Why aren't you at lunch?
Honey-baked ham day.
I'm just kind of busy,  like fixing the school.
Oh, well, actually that's  not really a bad idea  to take a look at yourself  especially when you  think something's  everybody else's fault.
OK.
Have you seen Maya?
She's,  like, mad at me or whatever.
Uh, sweetie pie, why don't you  sit down and have some lunch.
You don't seem like yourself today.
I'm on a hunger strike  until racism is over.
Oh.
Uh, you you want half of this?
-   - Because that other thing's  gonna take a sec.
What kind is it?
It's It's kind of a meat.
- Ham.
There might be cheese in it.
-   -  Just keep it.
Just keep it.
- No, no.
It's OK.
I'm good.
I'm fine.

Why'd they switch  out Aunt Viv?
Think about it.
She got that lighter skin, that's right.
Yo, Maya needs justice, man.
She needs to, like, put her  racist ass friend in check.
She's not really that  racist, she's like  a good person.
No, that shit that she said to you  was some of the most fucked  up stuff that I've ever heard.
I bet my sister doesn't  even know what racism is.
That is such bullshit.
Yes, I do.
It's like when you're mean to people  'cause of their skin  color and like lynch them.
No, it's not always as obvious as that.
Yeah, Maya, think about it.
Use your head.
-  Do your parents own the cleaners?
-  You look dirty.
When did you immigrate here?
I've never  met an oriental before.
-  Say something in Chinese.
-  Konnichiwa.

Get angry.
Hit her.
Yeah.

- I can't believe you fucking did that!
I was trying to help.
By telling everyone I'm Asian.
They already freaking know.
Am I right?
I know, I mean, duh,  like I know I'm Asian,  - but I'm more than that.
- I know and that's what I was trying to  - say, like  -  Yeah.
You just shouldn't hide it and  I just thought that I was  celebrating your heritage.
That's so easy for you to say.
You don't know what it's like to be me.
You're right.
I don't.
You're right.
OK, and I wanna choose which  Spice Girl I'm gonna be.
I know, you you should.
And I should've told them  that you are Posh Spice.

I don't want you to punch me either.
Please.
Yeah, you punch that racist.
Hit her.

Like, I feel like I was  going so much harder  - That guy  - He got so freaked out.
Are you sure, like, that  I didn't hurt you at all?
I was, like, rough  and tumble.
It's crazy.
Ma Ow!
You know that scares me.
Hey, Shuji.
What's up?
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
And I know that you probably  hate me now and I understand why.
I knew she wasn't gonna hit you, so  That's a lie.
- I was so freaking I was like  - Maya.
I was like    Dude, your Japanese is so bad.
No, it isn't.
- That's so mean.

- Oh, wait.
He has a quote.
It's like  "I just wanna fly.
Put  your arms around, me baby".
Sugar Ray, lyrics by Mark McGrath  Wait.
That's about you.

Well, he can't find you unless  you've told him where you live.
Are you say We were in a room  for Franklin County for hot people,  like, that's what we were in.
He doesn't know your name.
Does he?

So I heard something today  while I was, um, driving  Anna and Maya home.
They were whispering, but  What?
You have a boyfriend.
- What?
- Mom, what, you spying on us?
Who?
Someone we know?
Brandon.
Mom, it's Brendan.
It's not Brandon.
You're not even a good spy,  and we're just taking  it really, really slow.
We just barely started going out.
Is he a catch?
Because you are catch.
Kinda major catch.
Curtis, is this from  Wok N' Roll or Shanghai?
Because Wok N' Roll is  the one that made me sick  after your mole removal.
I thought that was Shanghai, so  OK, so this is Wok N' Roll.
Seriously I reminded you  this morning before you left.
Now again you made me  It's Chinese food.
No, it's not Chinese food.
That one place makes me sick,  and the other place doesn't.
I'm calling Anna for homework help.
OK.
- Hello?

I'm back in "Hot people  of Franklin County".
Oh, my God, you're back in?

I wanna eat that barf and guts up  like a big, old bowl of lentil soup.
Yum, yum, yum, yum  Sometimes there's so  much beauty in the world  I feel like I can't take it.
I love you more than I love my own dad.

And you just like, barely  know him is the only thing.
No, I know, but, like,  sometimes you can just tell.
- You haven't met him yet?
- It's from the way we're talking.
Wassup, Maya?
Hey.
See.
Even Evan's way less hot  to me since I met Flymiamibro.
- That's how you know.
- Oh, my God.
Don't look.
Hey, Anna.
Hey, Maya.
- Hey, Brendan.
- Hey.
I burned this for you.
'Cause you said you love music.

No, I do love music.
Thank you.

I do.
Seventh grade rules.
Good girlfriends   The blonde one   Is making me   I can't believe he made me a mix CD.

All I wanna do   Mm-hmm.
You think we can take a picture  of me and send it to Flymiamibro.
- No.
- Why?
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No.
Yes, it is.
It's just not something  we should be doing.
It's just like a picture of me  so he can know what I look like.
- No.
We are not doing it.
- No Anna, yes.
Maya, I'm putting my foot down.
Absolutely not.
That's hot.
And make sure you're  getting the boob too.
Sure, do.
OK, let me see it.
Let me see.
Oh, My God.
That looks bad.
That's blurry.
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, wait, I like that one.
That's good.
Showing a lot.
Um  How about just this one?
That's literally just my hand.
I know but it's beautiful.
OK.

I'm gonna send it.
Oh, my God.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Anna, Anna, stop.

Who are you guys talking about?
None of your freaking business, Jafeer.
Yeah, it's none of  your freaking business.
If you really want to know  I've met someone.
Or I'm about to meet him after school.
Wait, you haven't met him in person yet?
- That's shady.
- Oh no, we've talked on AIM like a lot.
He's probably some wart-y  old dude, who has a beer belly  or suit socks and lives with his mother.
Or he's a computer genius  with a tight bod, Jafeer.
- Like you wouldn't even  - Can we just change the conversation?
- What?
- Start a new one.
We weren't even talking to you.
It's just kinda lame.

- Anyway, Mai?
- What?
I'm like, so excited for you, honestly.
- I really, really am.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I just wanna ask one quick question.
- OK, what?
Are you sure that you want to meet him,  because what if he's  pissed that you're a kid.
I don't think that's a  possibility, like, I don't.
- OK.
- I'm not gonna stand him up.
I couldn't do that to him  - Right.
OK.
- You know.
Yeah.
- I just feel like we need back up.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

We should ask Brendan.
'Sup, B?
Spencer.
You're OK, Maya?
Can I get you some water?
I'm good.
I'm good.
Don't leave.
What if he gets mad when he sees me that  I don't look like what I said I look?
Maya, you're fine.
You're fine as hell.
You're finer than you even described.
Yeah.
And maybe he doesn't look  like how he described himself.
I mean, he could really  be anybody in here.
Yeah.

I think it's getting dark.
We should just get home  soon before it gets too late.
Do you think he  Do you think that he came and saw  me and thought I was ugly and left?
Well, if he did that,  then he's an idiot.
Yeah, or I'm like an idiot  for thinking he would like me.

He tried last time, and it just felt,  like, really weird and unnatural,  but it's like, "Why?
I'm hot.
He's hot".
Like  I think he's gonna.
Maybe it's gonna feel  natural on Saturday.
Like, it won't be as weird as that time.
Maybe.
Anna, it's so simple, like  It's like, this, like  - I don't know.

- Why?
'Cause I'm not invited.
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.
You asked.
Brendan  didn't actually invite me.
Oh, my God, you always do this.
He just said you're going,  so that means you're invited.
Yeah, but you're gonna be,  like, off making out with him,  and I'm just gonna be, like,  sitting there by myself.
Why don't you find  somebody to go with you?
Like who?
Flymiamibro's like at a computer  conference this weekend in Tucson.
I don't know.
You could ask one  of the guys from soccer practice.
Mm.
No.
Maya just do this thing.
- Did you get anybody?
- No.
Literally, no one will  even look at me, like  Aw!
I'm sure that's not true.

- What movie?
- Wild Things.
At Brendan's, like  Yeah.
Why?
- Well  -  Oh, my gosh!
Wow, Sam!
You're, like, really good at that.
Oh, thanks, Jenna.
It's   It's just dribblin'.
Wait, what?
Are you guys serious?
Oh, my God!
Dribbling's in  basketball, moron, like  No.
It's in uh soccer.
- Dribbling is in soccer, too.
- Yep.
That's what it's called, dribbling.
So, Jenna, a bunch of us are going  to Brendan Tooler's place tonight  to watch Wild Things.
It's going to be fun.
- You should come.
- Um, yeah.
OK.
That sounds fun.
Maybe you can show me  some of your moves there.
Well, there is not  gonna be soccer practice,  so that literally makes zero sense.
Um, cool, yeah.
- See you there.
- All right.
OK, I'm sorry, but she  was actually not invited.
I think it's really  weird that she'd show up.
Like, it's psycho, Sam.
I don't know why you're  being such a biatch,  because she's actually pretty nice.
Nice raging, dumbnuts.
I'm freaking nice, too.
And this is the den  where we watch movies,  and sometimes, I play video games.
-  Oh, my God, it's so cool.
-   -  Yeah.
- No, it's not.
It's a duck.
Wow thang!
Hmm-mm.
What's up?
- Hey.
- 'Sup!
'Sup!
'Sup!
- JK.
- What's up, Skyler?
Hey.
Who's ready for some snacks?
Oh, my gosh.
Hi, Mrs. Tooler.
I'm Anna Kone.
Anna!
I've heard so much about you!
I've heard so much about you.
Oh, Anna, you are just adorable.
Brendan, you talk  about her all the time,  but you didn't say how adorable she is.
Mom, leave.
- Um, your den is so stunning!
-  Yeah.
So polite.
She's a keeper, Brendy.
I'm gonna stick your  head in the oven, Mom,  if you don't shut up.
OK.
I can take a hint.
That must be Cousin Richard.
I'll got let him in.
Go.
Your mom is really sweet.
Yeah.
Whatever.
- Hey.
-  Hey.
- Oh, my God.
-  Everyone,  this is Cousin Richard.
- You got the movie?
-  Yeah.
Used my bro's ID.
- They bought it.
-   Why do you need an ID?
'Cause it's like X-rated I think.
I thought this was about animals.
Well, there are beavers, in it.
Oh, my God, Sam!
You're, like, so funny.
So let's get the party started.
Ladies and germs, tonight's  feature film stars Matt Dillon,  Kevin Bacon, Denise Richards,  Denise Richards' blammos,  and Neve Campbell.
It is rated "R" for adult  language and sexual situations.
- Yes!
-  Let's go.
Yeah.
With a runtime of 108 minutes  including credits,  which you wanna stick around  for, I give you Wild Things.
-   - Yeah, this is good.
Switch seats with me.
Why?
So you'll be closer to  Shh!
You can sit beside Brendan.
No.
Yes.
So who's washing your Jeep  this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?
Washing that old Jeep  of mine is sort of waste of time.
- Don't you think?
-  Not at all.
Brendan  wants to hook up with Anna.
Brendan wants to hook up with you.
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes.
He does.
Listen.
Cousin Richard  literally just told me.
My God, go!
Go follow him.
No!
No.
-  Go!
Go!
- You should go follow him.
Go.
It's now or never.
Go.
Come with me.
Come with me.
- No, let her go.
- I'm letting them go, Jenna.
Jenna, shut up!
- Will you please come with me?
-  No.
I'm gonna be there with  you in your head the whole  Move.
Go!
Bye.
- They're gonna get it all tonight.
- Oh, my God!
Don't try anything, perv.
I'll just move.
Sam, I was kidding.
Is this OK?
Absolutely.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Just gonna use the bathroom.
OK.
So you got my mom's money.
How much?
Hey.
After tonight the three of us  are not to be seen together again.
After tonight?
Oh, busted.
How was it?
I'll tell you later, OK?
Was it good?
Oh, here it is.
Everyone  needs to shut up.
God in Heaven.
Are you OK?
What happened?
- Na, what's wrong?
-  Stop.
And then, like, were  your lips close together  when you guys were  standing close together?
Yeah and then they touched.
They did.
- That's, like, romantic.
- No, it wasn't.
- Yo, it literally wasn't at all.
- Why?
He puts his lips, like,  all the way around mine  - Ew!
- and, like, sucked.
-  What?
- It's not funny.
Wait.
And then what?
Was  that it?
Like, he just sucked?
No, and then he put his tongue  in my mouth, and he, like  did like a torpedo cat tongue,  and, like, drilled my mouth.
What was it like?
- What did he do with it?
- Like this.
- Ew!
Ew!
Stop!
-  Yeah.
I can't.
I wish I could.
What did you do with your tongue?
Did you do it back or did you just,  like  It was, like, pinned back, like,  it was in trouble, you know.
- That's crazy.
- I know.
It was awful.
I'm sorry.
Well, at least you just, like,  had your first kiss, you know.
I wish that I hadn't.
- Don't say that.
- I really do.
Everything is just different now,  and I just have to breakup with him,  so  -  Really?
-   Yeah.
He's not the Brendan that bought us  snacks at the bowling alley, you know.
Mm-hmm.
He's like the Brendan that drilled  the back of my throat with his tongue.
So it's up to you to  get the next boyfriend.
Why?
What about Cousin Richard?
- Do you like him?
- No, I don't.
It's not him.
Oh, it's someone?
Is it Sam?
No.
No.
Let's just go to bed.
- Wait, look at me  - What?
and let me ask you again.
Is it Sam?
- Is what Sam?
- Do you like Sam?
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
Hey, butt-rat!
Hey, Maya.
What the hell?
You're, like,  being weird.
I'm mad at you.
- OK.
-  Seriously?
I normally say things to you, and  then you say, like, mean things back.
Mm.
Sorr  God, you're just, like, being so lame.
It's like ever since you started  dating whatever her fricking name is,  - you're just being  - Her name is Jenna.
Maybe if you try to be  nicer to me once in a while.
- I'm nice.
-  Oh, yeah?
So how about you say  something nice right now?
-  Like, right now?
- Yeah.
Argh!
OK, like  You're, like, less dandruffy  in carpool this year.
Oh, my God.
OK, I'm sorry.
OK.
You   OK, you're  you're, like, the funniest  person in our entire grade.
- Not bad.
- Yeah?
Do you have something  nice to say about me?
- Yeah.
- If you want.
Well, you do a really good Ace Ventura.
And?
And um  you are a awesome friend.
That's it?
- Hey, Maya.
Hi, Sam.
- Hi.
Walk me to class?
Um, sure.
See you later, Maya.
Whatever.
You've left your locker open.
-  OK.
So, can I read this to you?
-  Yeah.
OK.
"Dear Brendan, wassup"!
This is Anna Kone.
We've been  boyfriend-girlfriend for  three weeks now, which is the longest  relationship I've ever been in.
I've been doing a lot of thinking since  we kissed last night at Wild Things.
This is hard, but I don't  think you're the one for me.
So I'm breaking up with you.
I hope we can still be friends.
"See you in band.
Anna Kone".
That's really good.
Should I mention about the kiss that  it was bad that he needs to work on it?
No, I don't think so.
That's mean.
-  Right.
- Yeah.
Will you give it to him for me?
Yeah.
I will.
Shh!
It's Becca.
Do you think she knows?
Hmm.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
You need to get that  to him before she does.
- OK.
I can give  - Run fast.
Go!
Go!
Excuse me.
Have you seen  Brendan Tooler?
Skyler?
No?
Have you seen Brendan  or Skyler?
Brendan?
Have you seen Brendan  or Skyler?
None of you!
Phew!
- Hey, Kone, -  Hey, Becca.
Oh, my God.
Dear Anna,  I don't think it's a good  idea that we go out anymore.
I'm breaking up with you.
Brendan.
I couldn't find Brendan  or Skyler anywhere,  - so I can't reach  - It's OK.
It's OK.
We got broken up with.

I'm sorry.
- I'm an idiot.
- No.
I am.
- It's OK.
-    Your beady stupid  little eyes, your fat nose.
Can't play your stupid  saxophone like that, asshole.
What?
Your mom said she overheard some stuff  in carpool about you and Braydan.
That's not his name, and I  don't wanna talk about it.
You really shouldn't hold things inside.
Are you guys serious?
What do  you want me to say right now?
Do you want me to tell  you that I got dumped?
It's embarrassing.
That's  what's happened, so  - You're so much cuter than he is.
- Totally.
You're gonna have so many  boyfriends in your life  - Totally.
- before you  find the one you wanna be with.
I guess, yeah.
But but look  this is it.
This is This is love.
And you didn't have that with Brendan.
I know I didn't, and I still kissed him.
- Well, you had your first kiss.
- Oh!
We had and I wish I didn't.
It was disgusting.
You know life is  It's about experiences,  and someone else will come along.
Kissing definitely gets better.
Right?
Yeah.
What is wrong with you guys?
See.
It gets better  - OK.
Oh, my God!
- and better  and better.
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh, ooh!

1  Bye, Mom.
Love you.
Is she OK?
- She, like, didn't come down.
- That's OK.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.
Really?
Really, Dad.
You don't have any lingering  questions on your mind?
No, I mean  I just think that  probably the hardest part  was when you and mom told me.
Um but I think that it's ultimately  gonna be the best for everyone honestly,  - because we could all use a breather  - We could all use a breather  from the recent hostility.
It's not like things  are gonna get any better.
And maybe sometime,  after you guys take some space,  you guys might wanna get back  together or something.
I don't know.
Who knows.
Yeah.
Who knows.
I'm not a child   I'm just a woman   You don't have to be a girl anymore   Hey.
Hey.
Sorry I yelled at you last night.
Yeah, I thought I'd hear from you.
Last night was just  really shitty and like  Yeah, last night was  really shitty for me, too.
You know  guess we just can't do everything  together like we thought.
I'm just saying "hey"  to Heather really quick.
- Hey.
- Hi, Anna.
Hey.
- Hey, um  - I'm sorry to interrupt.
No, it's not, it's fine.
I'm sorry about your parents' divorce.
- Oh, thanks.
- When my parents divorced,  it, like, sucked, but you'll be fine.
- It's just hard to comprehend.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I know it feels like  the world's ending, right?
Yeah, it it really does, and  I'm, like, kind of in shock.
Mm-hmm.
On the bright side,  you'll get two of everything.
- So I gotta go.
- OK.
Bye.
Oh, thanks.
I'm OK.

So she's sitting with them now?
It's really different.
Do you know that she told  Heather before she told me  that her parents are getting divorced?
- Can you believe that?
- OK.
I'm gonna tell you something, Maya.
- Just don't freak out.
- Don't say anything to me right now.
What do you have to say?
What?

All right.
I heard a rumor that  Heather is taking Anna to the dance.
What?
What did you say?
That was our plan to go  to the dance together.
We had a lot of plans  tonight so that's real  Ho, ho, bitch.

What?
What time do you think  you're gonna be at Sam's?
Um, what time?
I don't know.
I'm not that good at time.
Oh, really?
'Cause I feel,  like, you're usually,  like, always on time and good  with time and, like, keeping time.
- Why do you keep saying "time"?
- 'Cause, um  I heard that you were  invited to Heather's  to get ready at her house before.
Is that what you're gonna do?
No, I didn't say that.
I might take pictures  after this with Heather  and do half the time there  and half the time at Sam's.
- Yeah.
So you lied.
- OK, Wait a second.
You're expecting me to drive you  to two places now to  have your picture taken?
Because we did not discuss this.
And and who is Heather?
Heather Heather Taylor?
Yeah, she's like the most  popular girl in school.
- Ooh.
- I guess, like,  Anna's best friends  with her right now so  I'm actually not best friends with her.
She's just being really nice to me.
- OK.
- So  - Whatever.
It's fine.

- But you promise not to get mad.
Yeah.
Why did you tell Heather  about your parents  getting divorced before me?
- I called you first.
- No, you didn't.
For your information, I did.
I called you first,  and you didn't pick up.
Then why didn't you leave a message?
- Maya  - What?
That my parents are divorcing.
- Yeah.
- And you were so mad at me that night.
So I called Heather,  because she's the only person  in our grade with  parents that are divorced.
- Lie.
- What are you talking about?
Terra Newback.
- OK.
- Terra Newback's parents are divorced.
OK, I didn't think about that.
- I'm just saying, like  - When you found out you were so weird  you didn't even care.
You didn't.
You were, like  'Cause it's a huge deal,  and I shouldn't have  found out that way.
Like, are you serious?
It's not about you!
Are you serious, Maya?
- It's not about you!
- OK, sorry!
It's about me, because  it's the saddest thing  that has ever happened to me.
No, it's fine, it's fine,  it's fine.
Stop!
Come here.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what it's like.
I could never know, and I'm sorry.
- Parents are assholes.
- Yeah, they really are.
That's all really.
It's fine.
Thanks.
Wait.
Oh, my God.
Do you wanna take a walk?
But, no, no, stop.
We're just gonna do it, like  We're doing it.
Listen to that.
- Is that the wrong way?
- No, I think that's the right way.
