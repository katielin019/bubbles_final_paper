{START OF EPISODE 1}
- Immigration?
- Revenue.
Missus Rose!
There are people here from the government!
I've been gutted!
John, I've been stripped of every morsel of pleasure I earned in this life!
Well, how do you think I feel, Moira?
!
Eli was family, for God's sake!
Leave your finances to me, he said!
Son of a bitch!
Baby, it's crazy, people are just like, taking our stuff!
I said, they're taking our stuff!
Can you just step out of the club for a second, ple Hold on, hold on!
Those bags are not for you, my boyfriend bought those for me, so, theoretically, they are his!
Please sir, can you step aside?
No, you step aside!
You step aside!
I'm still trying to wrap my mind around what kind of a sick person wants to get paid to destroy another person's life!
Destroy another person's life!
Where are you taking that?
!
My very soul has been kidnapped, there's no ransom, no one's coming to save me!
We've got 15 minutes to collect our personals, - can we pick up the pace?
!
- No, no!
Did you put Kristen with Robin?
They don't like each other!
Nooooo!
Nooooo!
Eli really did a number, Johnny.
He took everything.
They're still looking for him, they think he's in the Caymans.
He was our business manager, he's supposed to pay taxes!
Hmm.
There is a very small amount set aside for you, and one asset the government has allowed you to retain.
The kids.
The children are dependents, Moira.
You bought a small town in 1991, Johnny.
Yes, I bought that as a joke for my son.
Wait, you actually purchased that town?
Yes, I purchased the town, how else could I get the deed?
- You could've photo shopped the deed!
- And saved the money!
Why would I Photoshop a deed, the joke was owning the town!
- Okay, stop.
- That was the joke!
- Oh my God!
- Well, that was the joke!
To Johnny's credit This town just might be your saving grace, at least for a while.
What do you mean?
You can live there for next to nothing, until you get back on your feet.
I'm sure there's a penthouse we can move into, please, there are other options.
Well, homelessness is still on the table.
The whole time I was surrounded by old women wearing visors, who smelled like yams!
There was nowhere to lie down!
There was nowhere to lie down, there was no bed!
There was no kitchen.
I know!
No.
I don't know what to tell you, there's like, cows all over the place, like, everywhere.
I don't know if there's even a station, I don't know what's happening!
Johnny Rose!
Roland Schitt.
Oh, you're the mayor we're supposed to meet.
That's right, I'm the mayor, so if you're looking for an ass to kiss, it's mine!
Oh, this is my family, my son Let's get you all squared away in the office there, Johnny, okay, the gals can grab the bags, you follow me, all right, right this way, watch it, honey, here we come.
The "Cheaters" marathon we watched, it's like that.
Children, keep an eye on these bags.
Apparently in hell, there's no bellman!
- David, what are we - Shut up!
- You shut up!
- You shut up!
- Um, you shut up!
- You shhhut up!
The name is Rose.
I don't see a reservation under that name.
It's okay, Stevie, I set aside two rooms for them.
Well, there's nothing here.
Well okay, fine, just book 'em in with two rooms, these people own the town; They're big deals.
We'll need three rooms, minimum.
Ooh, no can do, honey.
Look, we have a one room comp policy here, and I am personally throwing in an extra room out of sheer decency, so What about suites?
Do you have a couple of suites?
This guy!
Um No, this is a motel, so we cater more to off road truckers and drunk teenagers.
Please, someone just give me a key, to a door, to a room any room!
I just want a bathtub, and a long extension cord, please.
There you go, ma'am.
It smells like a gym bag.
Does anyone else feel light headed?
Oh my God, this takes me back to high school.
You know, I did the deed in just about every room in this place.
Yep, if a forensic team came in here with one of those blue lights, this place would just light up!
Okay, that's good.
- Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
- Oh my God.
Oh my God!
Oh hey, chief, the other room's right through there.
Here you go.
And there's the bed, I should probably pull off that cover, and burn it.
All right.
Good, Roland, thank you very much, appreciate everything, uh Have a ball in the land down under!
Ever wanna ride a kangaroo?
Okay.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Oof!
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay!
Okay.
Okay.
I love you!
Oh, okay, well, it looks like you got all the channels except for Channel 19 for some reason.
I don't know why.
Well, the thing is we won't be watching a lot of television, but again, thank you, I don't want to keep you, I know you're a busy man.
Whoa!
Hi.
Can I help you?
I'm looking for an extra towel, Okay And this might be a stupid question, considering the state of the rugs in our room, but do you have a business centre here?
Yes, we do have a business center.
You can find it right outside the doors to your left, right beside the hammam spa.
Would you like me to book you a treatment while you're at it?
Thank you, no, just the towel, thanks.
I'll get those right out.
Well Roland, once again, thank you for giving us the lay of the land here, but we have some serious unpacking to do.
- Oh, sure!
- If you don't mind.
No problem there, Johnny, I don't mind helpin' out.
Listen, one thing before I go here, um Do you mind if I use your toilet?
Is it absolutely necessary?
Uh, yeah, I would say it's absolutely necessary!
Excuse me.
Absolutely necessary.
Yes, that train has left the station, if you know what I mean!
- I need that bed.
- Why?
- Because I need it.
- Why?
Because if someone were to break in here in the middle of the night wanting to murder us, they would attack this bed first, so I need this bed.
So you're saying that you want me to get murdered first?
!
In front of you?
And then what would you do?
Would you just run away and leave me to bleed out On the floor?
!
Uh, sort of, that was the plan, yeah.
Okay.
Well, you can have the bed when I leave.
Well, where are you going?
Stavros is flying in to get me, I told you that.
What do you mean Stavros is com What do you mean?
When?
When is he doing that?
Like, whenever stupid Mary-Kate stops hogging his plane.
Well, where are we going?
Okay, at present, he's just coming for me, but then I figured that we would just come back and grab you guys at some point.
What kind of sociopath abandons her family in some vomit soaked dump, to gallivant around the world with her dumb shipping heir loser boyfriend she's known for three months?
!
Um, David, it will be four months next month!
Oh my God!
And he just told me that he could potentially see himself considering saying "I love you" at some point sometime soon, so That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I'm telling mom.
I'm telling mom and dad, have you told them?
No!
No David, I'm waiting for the right opportunity.
Okay, otherwise dad's gonna cry, and mom's gonna do that thing where she pretends that nothing's wrong, and then just doesn't talk to me for five months, and I don't want that.
Well, I need this bed!
I need it, so.
You know what, David?
!
You get murdered first for once!
No, you get murdered first!
David, you get murdered first!
No, you!
You do it!
Yes, you get murdered first!
David, you get murdered first!
I actually think this place is kinda cute.
Did you say cute?
No Alexis, Martha Stewart's Hampton home is cute.
Where's that weird man?
Where?
He's in the bathroom.
He he won't leave!
Well, he's been in there for a very long ti Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Jeez.
Um Boy.
Remind me to get that window fixed.
It will not open.
Roland, listen, thank you very much, but I appreciate everything you've done, we need a little private time now, as a family.
Sure, well actually, those curtains do close there so Oh, look!
You've got Channel 19!
Roland, could you get the fuck out?
!
This latest model is a revelation in innovation.
I am not lying folks, it's gonna last you a lifetime.
You are gonna thank That was an overreaction.
That was uncalled for.
It's just you know, we're a little tired, it's been a long day, there's a pharmacy worth of drugs wearing off on most of us right now, and I just think as a family, we just need a little time to chill.
Johnny, please, you don't have to apologize, and you really don't have to hit me over the head with this sort of thing, I get it, you need your little family time and all that, I'm sure.
No problem.
You know what I'll do, I'll um I'll just get the fuck out of here.
Ugh, we have to eat in here?
!
I think it's kinda sweet.
Alexis, what's going on with you?
- What do you mean?
- Seriously?
!
The room was "cute," this place is "sweet".
I am personally offended by this place, I don't know what you think is nice about it.
The town is disgusting.
It is gruesome.
It is charming, it is quaint, it's like out of a storybook.
Alexis, what the hell is the matter with you?
!
Okay Stavros is flying in to get me, and I am going to go live with him for a little bit.
Well, that is not happening.
And I am appalled that my baby girl has turned into a selfish, duplicitous whore!
Oh, hello!
Hi, I'm Twyla.
I'll be your waitress today.
Anyway, I read about you guys, and everything you've gone through, it sounds super crappy.
Super crappy?
I had a second cousin in Elmdale who did telemarketing, he made a ton of money.
It turns out his entire business was illegal, and he lost everything.
Hm not quite the same.
Yeah, no, he went to prison, which is terrible, but But he is learning Spanish, no mas, le duele!
I think it means, "stop, it hurts".
Oh, wonderful anecdote.
Could you give us a moment please?
Whenever you're ready, I'm just right over here.
I forbid you to abandon our family.
I am a grown woman, mother.
This is an act of a spoiled child!
I think it's unforgivable!
I think that you're just super jealous, 'cause I'm getting out of here!
Also, you have a big thing of dandruff on your eyebrow.
- Don't do that!
- Kids, stop, stop!
The world is falling apart around us John, and I'm dying inside.
Well, I'm feeling a little queasy myself.
Oh, brisket!
- Give me some spale!
- David!
John - Oh my God!
- Umm These rooms did have doors, didn't they?
Yeah, it's a hotel, they're hotel rooms!
It's a motel!
These are motel rooms.
What if they took our stuff?
!
What stuff?
There's no stuff to take.
I have stuff!
Son of a bitch!
Yeah, I've got a problem.
If this is about doors Yeah, it's about doors, yeah, my doors are gone, my front door, somebody stole my doors!
Yeah, you're gonna have to talk to Roland about that.
He lives just down the street, you make a left out of the motel and then another left.
It's a house with a truck in the driveway.
There's a bumper sticker of a naked Helen Mirren.
Oh my God, no!
No!
No!
- What?
!
- Ah!
My earrings!
They were there.
- They're not there!
- Where did they go?
I don't know!
I don't know!
First you threatened to abandon me, and now my precious diamonds are gone!
Okay, you are super dramatic right now.
Shut up and look for them!
Get open!
Roland, I see you behind the truck!
Yeah, of course you see me.
I'm looking at my gravel.
Gravel these days, what are you gonna do?
- Yeah, it's gravel.
- Yeah, it's gravel!
Hey, good news for you.
I talked to a guy about that bathroom window.
That's the least of my concerns right now!
Oh really?
Well, why don't we address your concerns?
!
The doors!
I want my doors back!
- Oh!
- Before it gets dark!
My son is afraid of moths.
Oh, hmm.
Well, here's the thing about that Johnny, you see, you did a bad thing.
You disrespected me in front of your family!
And now they think less of me.
I doubt that's possible.
And to be honest, you were kinda breathing down our necks a little bit back at the motel.
Johnny, when I was a kid and I did a bad thing, my father took the doors off my room.
And he said to me, "Roland, privacy is earned".
I am having a tough time following that.
What the hell does that have to do with privacy?
Nothing.
I just got mad, and I took your doors.
Look, if you took offense to anything I said back at the motel, just know it wasn't personal.
All right, apology accepted.
Well, that was less of an apology, and more of an explanation.
Nevertheless, I accept your apology.
Which it wasn't!
So thank you again for that apology.
Well, there was no apology, and I can't do this anymore!
You said you're sorry in a very sweet and humble way, and that takes a big man to do that, and that's what Johnny Rose is!
A big man!
Ooh!
Oh!
Hello!
Hello!
Hi, hello, come here, please.
I don't suppose you saw any hobos or crackheads loitering around the hotel today?
No crackheads, no While the rooms were exposed to the world like a Moroccan fair, someone got in here and stole my earrings.
But it was just but it was just you here today.
- It was.
- It was.
I'm assuming you were the only one here on the premises today?
I think I know where you're going with this.
No, I'm simply confirming that you alone were here when the earrings were stolen.
Are you asking me if I stole your earrings?
No, I would never, please!
But I also would certainly never press charges if my earrings were suddenly to be returned.
If they suddenly reappeared, if you gave them back I would not press charges, I would look the other way.
Okay, you know what?
I gotta run.
'Cause I wanna hit the pawn shop before it closes.
I owe my crack dealer a ton of money, so.
You seem like you have this under control, though.
What just happened?
!
David, I politely asked that concierge girl if she had stolen my earrings, and she turned ice cold, and now she's on her way to a pawn shop!
What?
!
I need a towel!
Hello, hi.
Hi, I am sorry if my mom accused you - of taking something.
- It's fine.
Okay, but does this mean that when you're cleaning our rooms, you're gonna put weird stuff in our beds out of spite, or something?
I won't be cleaning your room.
Okay, can I ask you a question?
Shoot.
I think you're kind of rude!
Is that a question?
I have asked you thrice now for a towel, so that I may wash this town off my body.
Do you think I wanna be here?
Do you think I wanna be here?
!
I don't know what you want, you've given me one word answers since I got here!
So if I get you a towel you'll stop following me to my car?
Yes!
Yes!
Fine, but I'm only doing this because you called me rude, and I take that as a compliment.
The man is a lunatic!
What the hell happened here?
We've been robbed.
Right now some local is pawning my earrings for crank.
- Your diamonds?
!
- Yes, my diamonds, the one thing I could hide under my tongue.
Moira, I took your earrings out of here, and I put them in my shoe.
For safekeeping.
No!
No!
Stavros just texted me.
And he ended it, he's not coming!
He said he doesn't have time to come and get me, because he already rsvp'd to Diddy's white party, and doesn't have time to do both!
But I was supposed to be his date to the white party!
Alexis, he was never my favourite Stavros.
I've hated that guy ever since he asked me to do lines with him at my sixtieth.
Just out of sheer curiosity, um, where do you stand now on whether or not you think this motel is cute?
Like, is it still cute, or is it You're a dick, David!
Oh, I'm a dick!
Okay, did I dump you for a party?
!
David, help me with the doors.
No I can't, I just got out of the shower.
- I need help with the doors.
- Oh my God!
David, help him with the doors!
- You help him with the doors!
- No!
David, could you help me with the doors?
!
It's air drying!
Pick up a hammer, and nail this coffin shut!
As if I didn't see this coming.
He's broken up with me five times already.
Like, there was that time that he never met me in Rio, and remember that time that he gave me his ex wife's engagement ring?
And then, last summer, that time that he left his Molly in my glove compartment, and then I got arrested?
Oh my God!
Can you do me a huge favour?
And never repeat this to anyone that you respect, okay?
- Okay?
Okay.
- Okay.
Kids, we just came in to say good night, and to remind you that we will get through this - Okay, good night!
- As a family Warmest regards to you both.
And that will end up on our feet in no time!
Of course, by then our feet will be shoeless, and filthy and mangled, from walking on cigarette butts and broken beer bottles.
So, seriously Alexis, enough about Stavros!
I'm sorry if I am going through something right now!
You're going through something?
!
- Good night, children.
- Good night!
- Good night.
- Good night.
Let's all pray we don't wake up.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1    - Johnny: Moira!
Moira!
- Moira: Hm.
Moira: Oh no!
I just finally cried myself to sleep.
Johnny: The bed is soaking wet.
Moira: Is it blood?
Johnny: No!
There's there is leak in the ceiling.
There is a brown disgusting drip coming.
Moira: Owwww!
Johnny: Look it!
Look oh my God.
- Moira: I can't do it.
- Johnny: This place is a dump!
It's a dump - Moira: I tried!
- Johnny: You know what it's a hell hole.
I tired, John, but I can't!
Johnny: Wake up.
- David: Ahh!
- Alexis: Ahh!
Johnny: Start packing, the plumbing is shot to hell in this place and we are getting out.
We are getting out!
David: What are you wearing?
What is that?
A nightgown?
Johnny: It's a nightshirt, David.
And that's not the issue.
The issue is the brown sludge in my bed.
We're selling the place!
David: It's 6:00 am!
Johnny: What's the name of that mouthy kid at the front desk?
David: I don't know.
I'm trying very hard not to connect with people right now.
The mouth the mouth, the girl.
David: You might want to rethink the nightgown first.
There's an Ebenezer Scrooge thing happening right now.
Alexis: Oh my God, that's who I was thinking of.
Johnny: You know what?
!
I'll do it myself.
My best to Bob Cratchit.
Hello!
Hello!
Service?
This bell is broken.
Stevie: Yeah, sorry.
It's more or less decorative.
Johnny: There's a leak in my room.
Brown, disgusting sewage water was dripping all over my bed this morning.
I was soaking wet.
So I need a plumber.
Stevie: You want me to call a plumber?
Johnny:  Do I want you to call a plumber?
Yes, yes I do.
I want you call You should already be on the phone.
Could you call a plumber?
Stevie let's see if he's home or conscious.
He's a good guy, he's just a big drinker.
Johnny: I also need a real estate agent.
The name of a good real estate agent right away.
Stevie: Ooh, there's a guy named Ray.
Yeah.
He's the best one.
He's also the only one so A guy named Ray Stevie: Is there anything else I can help you with, Mr. Rose?
Yes.
My wife and I will be taking breakfast in our room this morning.
Eggs florentine and a yoghurt parfait.
Stevie: Yeah unfortunately, due to a lack of everything, we don't do room service.
Uh, but you're always welcome to help yourself to our complimentary espresso bar.
Johnny: I'd rather drink the pipe-water.
Stevie: I hear ya.
Alexis: Ew!
Who even is this girl?
He said he'd never date someone with a toe ring and yet - Moira: Rub my back.
- David: What?
!
No.
Moira: I rubbed your back many a nights when you were little.
David: Yeah, in exchange for half my allowance.
Moira: Fine.
You may select one silver piece from my accessory case.
- Right here.
- Alexis: Omigod she has hakuna matata tattooed on her foot.
David: Stavros was seeing escorts before you.
A Disney tattoo shouldn't be a surprise.
We said no social media post breakup.
We had a pact about that.
David: He dates hooker.
Oh, well, I'm sorry, I don't hire my friends at model castings.
Actually, now that I think about in, where are those friends?
David: They're just giving me space right now.
Because they're considered people.
Alexis: Oh right.
Space.
Yeah.
David: Okay.
Well, I think it's bests that he dumped you.
Alexis: He didn't dump me.
We actually both decided that it was best that he see other people so Moira: Children, mindless bickering is a luxury we may no longer afford.
You are blind to reality and for that I am most proud but our worlds evil twin has reared her ugly David: Okay.
I'm taking my journal into the bathroom.
Where I will be shutting the door.
David!
You might actually wanna hear this.
Ray: Oh hi!
Johnny: Are you Ray?
- Ray: Yes.
- Johnny: You're late.
Johnny Rrose.
My wife, Moira.
- Moira: Hello.
- Ray: Hi.
Oh, I love your complexion.
Ray: So what can I help you with, housing, investment opportunities?
Moira: Mr. Rose and I would like to put a for sale sign on this incredible town.
Johnny: We're willing to settle for what we paid for it.
More if you can get it, but definitely not less.
Ray: Well, I'm not gonna lie to you I'm not super optimistic.
You know, because the government saw no value in Schitt's Creek.
You know, when they repossessed your assets.
You know, because of the humiliating Johnny: Yes, we know.
We know.
We know.
Ray: Well, we'll do our best.
First we just have to get Roland to sign off on the listing and then we're good to go.
I need to confer with the financial powerhouse of the family.
Since when did the mayor need to sign off on this?
Johnny: Ray, since when did the mayor need to sign off on this?
Ray: Well, it's all here Son of a bitch!
David: Oh, excuse me.
I don't think my sheets have been cleaned.
They smell like cigarettes.
Stevie: No, that's just the way they smell.
Also, you can tell your dad that the plumber was busy so I just pushed the bed against the wall and put down a bucket where the bed was.
David: Okay.
We're gonna be selling the town, so it'll be someone else's problem soon.
Stevie: But it's such a great place to live.
I think you're funny.
Thank you.
Um, look I know this probably isn't your thing, but there's a tailgate party later.
It's not exactly clubbing but you know close.
I don't even know what 'tailgate' means.
In my mind I'm picturing like a Klan rally.
Stevie: Yeah, just fewer pointy hats.
It's just townies with un-ironic haircuts.
David: Okay.
I'm gonna pass I'm not really in the mood to be a victim of a hate crime tonight so Alexis: Okay.
Stavros just posted three more photos.
Who are these jenky women?
Uh, from the looks of it they're blonde and mostly naked so  Is there a bar in this place or are we in one of those religo cult towns?
Stevie: I was just telling your brother about a party tonight.
But he passed so Alexis: Um, yes.
Love that journey for me.
Okay, so I'm looking for a guy like a mechanic or someone that hammers stuff.
Um, at least 5'7.
Kind of like full lips.
Athletic body.
Maybe a neck tattoo would be cute.
David: No, it wouldn't.
You know, I think this could be really good for me.
So thank you.
Stevie: You're welcome.
Yeah.
I'm looking forward to it.
Having all that fun.
Wow.
Roland: So Johnny Rose wants the ol' Johnny Hancock, huh?
Johnny: Well  Shouldn't be a problem, Johnny.
I'm happy to signoff on the listing.
Johnny: Well, thank you, very much, Rolland, I appreciated.
Roland: Sure.
Why don't you come over tonight and pick it up.
Johnny: Mr. Mayor, that's not necessary.
No, no.
Roland, a signature, that's all I need.
Roland: Johnny look, here is what you're gonna do; you're gonna grab the kids, you're gonna grab Moira, you're gonna come over we're gonna sit down like civilized people, have a few laughs, and then at the end of the evening we'll get to the big signing, okay?
Johnny: Right.
Okay.
Honestly Roland, it's just a, it's just a signature.
A flick of the wrist.
That's it.
Roland: You're not rejecting my hospitality, are you, Johnny?
Because that really wouldn't be a good way to start things off, I don't think.
Johnny: No, no.
I'd love to come to dinner are you kidding me?
No.
I just thought, let's do business first, get the signature, and then dinner.
Johnny, you want that, to get that you need this.
So let's just do this my way.
Johnny: Yeah, yeah, sure.
Yeah, dinner is.
Roland: Dinner it is, atta boy.
Okay.
Moira: How did you not get the contract signed, John?
Can one thing, just one thing, not be easy in this town?
!
Johnny: Look Roland's playing games, honey, he's playing games.
So this is something we have to do.
Alexis: Okay.
Well, I would love to go, but I've actually double booked myself.
I'm going to a truck party um, with the front desk girl and obviously she'd be super devastated if I bailed last minute.
So I can't.
I can't go.
Johnny: Okay.
Well, cancel it because you're coming to dinner.
Alexis: No.
One of you kids has to come.
Davis, you've got nothing on tonight.
How how do you know that.
What do you have on tonight?
- David: What?
- Johnny: Good, it's settled.
Moira: Or you could go alone, John.
Since you are the one who did not get the contract signed.
Johnny: Moira, Roland wants the family there tonight, so my family has to go tonight.
Let me explain something about business.
- Moira: Don't you dare - Johnny: It's a dance.
And sometimes you lead.
and sometimes you follow.
Moira: And which are you doing now, John?
Johnny: I am leading, Moira.
Moira: In a Roland game I think you're following.
Following in the game but leading in the dance, right?
And he thinks he's leading in the dance, but only because I've allowed him to think - Moira: Are you listening to this?
- David: Hmm?
Johnny: It doesn't matter.
I'm leading.
Moira: I'll shall bathe.
And if I bang my head and slip beneath the surface, so be it, Mr. Rose.
- Johnny: What's this?
- David: Uh yeah, Stevie called.
Apparently the plumber's in rehab.
And you also you have something on your I don't know what that is but it's a thing.
Alexis: David, for the gate party tonight is it more of a leather pants thing or Son of a bitch!
Thanks for having us, Jocelyn.
Thank you.
Jocelyn: Make yourselves at home.
Roland is just on the toilet.
Johnny: Oh, what a surprise.
David: You have a really lovely home.
It's really um, understated.
Jocelyn: Thank you.
I get a lot of my ideas from magazines.
- Moira: Don't be modest.
-  This is 100 percent you and only you.
Roland hey, okay.
It's the Roses.
Come on, folk, please sit.
Come on, I'm just the mayor for crying out loud.
Ooh, hors d'oeuvres.
Mmm.
Jocelyn: That's too bad about Alexis.
Well, it is.
But we did bring the life of the party.
- Moira: Our David.
-  Roland: Well, I guess, that just means there is more for you and me, right Dave?
Jocelyn: I hope everyone likes a cheeseball.
Cheeseball?
It's the treat that keeps our love life percolating.
It's like an aphrodisiac with him.
Go ahead.
Johnny: Oh yes, can't wait.
Can't wait.
Mmm.
Jocelyn: So David, tell us about yourself I hear you're a gallerist.
Roland: Wow.
There's a $10 dollar word.
Moira: David owned a brilliant gallery.
Tell them about your last show.
- David: It's not - Moira: You must, please.
Johnny: Tell them, David, tell them.
David: The gallery worked with Janet Kempfluugen.
Johnny: Kempfluugen?
She's a Brooklyn based performance artist she's a big deal.
Anyway um she would walk into the space wearing a clay mask of a fawn, remove her clothing and breast feed members of the audience.
It was a commentary on income inequality.
Roland: Wow Johnny: Heady stuff.
Roland: Well, hmm Alexis: Lipgloss?
Stevie: No thank you.
Alexis: I wish I could pull off the whole gloomy, no makeup look.
It's so French.
Stevie: Thank you.
Alexis: So, why are you single?
Stevie: Who said I'm single?
Alexis: Girl, we're on the hunt.
I hope you're single.
Stevie: Oh, no.
I'm not "on the hunt".
A town this size, you've either been through 'em or know a little too much about 'em.
Alexis: Hmm.
Okay.
I'm gonna go do a lap and this swan is best when she flies solo.
- So you're gonna be okay?
- Stevie: I live here.
- Alexis: Okay.
Am I good?
- Stevie: Hm-hm.
- Alexis: Yes?
Okay.
Thank you.
- Stevie: Are you not cold- Chuck, beer!
Roland: I know it's gotta be in here somewhere, slippery little bastard.
Johnny: Maybe a fork would help, Roland?
Roland: Oh, that's sweet.
Thank you.
I'm okay.
I'll find it.
Johnny: So is that the ah, contract over there?
Yeah, it is.
You know, I gotta be honest with you, I tried reading that thing it is really boring.
Ah, got it!
There she is!
Okay.
Ohh!
Oh my God, honey oh, that is good.
That is good.
Moira: I believe you were saying, John.
Johnny: Yes.
This reminds me of a merger I put together in Zurich.
It was two families breaking bread together.
David: Ahh!
Agh.
My head.
My head hurts.
Jocelyn: Oh no!
Are you okay?
David: Um, it think it's the migraines that I get a lot.
Johnny: Oh, I think I think that'll pass, David.
I don't think it's gonna pass.
I don't think it's passing.
Jocelyn: Migraines can be so awful.
Johnny: Yeah, well, not this one.
Not this one.
David: Yeah, you know what?
I I think I need to go.
Johnny: I think you need to eat something and that will help.
No, I think I need to go back.
Moira:  Take me with you please.
Johnny: David, sit down.
Sit down.
Sit back down.
David: Jocelyn, thank you so much for dinner.
Roland: Why don't you lay down on our mattress.
The sheets are in the dryer but there is rubber pad.
- No.
Thanks.
- Johnny: David!
Don't go near the door.
- David!
Do not open that door.
-  I brought vodka as a house gift.
I don't see it.
Alexis: That's what I say.
Great.
- I'm Twyla from the cafe.
- Yeah.
David: Yeah.
Davis Rose.
- Twyla: I'm a little drunk.
- David: Hm-hmm.
- Stevie: Hey.
-Twyla: Hey Stevie.
Twyla: I am going to roast myself a marshmallow.
- Anybody?
- Stevie: No.
Thanks.
- Twyla: You're all good?
- David: No.
Twyla: Great.
Stevie: I don't know why you were so reluctant to show up here.
You fit right in.
David: Well, my sister texted me "help".
And my mind went straight to deliverance.
So I wasn't too far off.
Stevie: That's funny because your sister texted me from across the bonfire and said you'd probably show up here because you were bored and lonely and had nothing better to do.
David: Well, my sister is a broken shell of a human being.
That's where that's coming from so Stevie: Oh, okay.
Oh.
Well, she seems fine.
Are you serious?
That's so funny.
That's so funny.
So I guess you're free to go.
David: I'm gonna need a stiff drink to get through this.
Stiff.
Moira: So Jocelyn, you were saying that you teach high school, or you want to finish high school?
I'm not sure, I couldn't hear over your husband's chewing.
I teach high school.
Oh, you're a saint.
I love it.
I love connecting with the young people.
Although I know those boys are undressing me every time I drop a piece of chalk.
Yeah.
Well, maybe we should hold onto our chalk, hmm?
Jocelyn: They're boys!
It's cute.
Moira:  John Roland: Oh, there it is!
There it is!
- The Vivien Blake bitch face!
- Moira: Excuse me?
Roland: I didn't want to say anything, but you were my favourite character on "Sunrise Bay".
- Moira: Thanks.
- Jocelyn: It's true.
He lived for "Sunrise Bay".
I could be doing cartwheels in a thong in front of that television, which I have done, but if your show was on, I was as good as wall paper.
Roland: Hey, how many people did you slap on that show?
Moira: I don't care.
Johnny: She can't remember, there were so many slaps.
Moira: Enough about me.
Let's talk about you signing this contract.
Roland: Well, somebody is in a little hurry, ain't she?
Johnny: No, no.
We're not in a hurry.
No.
- Moira: Aren't we?
- Johnny: No.
We're not.
No.
- Moira: Really?
- Roland: There it is again!
Bam!
- Okay, I'll tell you what, Vivien - Moira: Moira.
Roland: I will go ahead and sign off on the sale - Moira: Good.
- Roland: For a slap.
Excuse me?
Roland: I've always wanted to be slapped by Vivien Blake.
Jocelyn: It's true.
We've role-played it like a thousand times, - but it's not the real thing.
- Roland: Hm-hm.
Moira: You'd like me to slap you?
- Roland: Yeah.
- Moira: I don't think Roland: Well, don't think.
Just do it.
Slap me.
- Johnny: He wants you to slap him.
- Moira: I won't.
- Jocelyn: Slap him, Moira.
- Johnny: Go ahead and slap him.
Jocelyn: Slap my husband, Moira.
- Moira: John, I won't!
- Johnny: Slap him or I'll slap him.
- Roland: Slap me!
- Moira: I won't.
- Roland: Slap me like a bitch!
- Moira: Sign the fucking contract!
Okay.
Um this has been a lot of fun, but I'm starting to smell a little too much like uh, campfire, and denim and plaid and stuff so bye.
Stevie: Your choices are beer or beer.
David: I assume a pint glass is out of the question?
Alexis: You came!
How was dinner?
David: Um worse than this?
Although at this point it's sort of a moving target.
Stevie: Here hold this.
So there are no guys for me here.
But it was kind of nice to just like to flex the old muscle.
Stevie: Put your thumb over the tube.
Agh, I kind of wanna just go for it but - But sometimes it doesn't work out, I guess.
- David: Yeah.
- Stevie: Okay, put the tube in your mouth.
- David: What?
Uh - Yeah.
Just open your throat.
- David: Oh.
Stevie: And go down, 'cause you're tall.
Alexis: Okay.
David, how long are you gonna be doing this?
Okay, just come and get me after you vomit, okay?
Stevie: Just widen your throat!
You!
- Stevie: Chug!
- Crowd: Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Crowd: Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Crowd: Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Alexis: Are you ready?
And that's the last one there!
Done!
Ronald: Already.
There you go, Johnny, congratulations.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Just remember one thing, okay?
This is my town and you're gonna play by my rules.
Comprende?
I'm just messing with you, man!
- Come on!
-  - Johnny: Wow.
- Roland: Or am I?
No.
I am.
- Johnny: Moira!
Shall we?
- Moira: Yeah.
Moira: Jocelyn, thank you for an unforgettable evening, I will be dining out on this for years.
Jocelyn: I'll send you the recipes.
Yes, Jocelyn, words can't express.
Roland: Seriously, Johnny, good luck selling the town.
- You sure gonna need it.
- Johnny: Why's that?
Roland: Well, it took a while to sell the first time.
I mean, it was on the market for like what 20 years before you bought it.
Johnny: 20 years?
Roland: Yeah.
I mean, most people just thought it was a waste of money that it would never sell, you know?
Who in their right mind would buy it!
Then along came you.
Moira: John!
Did you know this town was on the market for 20 years before we bought it?
How would I know that?
W why would I know that?
I didn't know that.
But look, let's look at the bright side Moira: There is no bright side.
This is the dark side of the moon, Johnny.
And we'll be here another 20 years, tucked in a crater, lost to all.
Johnny well, you know what?
I think that's being a little dramatic.
Moira: Yes!
It's dramatic!
Sweetheart!
We got the thing signed, okay?
!
And if we have to fix this town up before we sell it, then we fix it up.
We fix it up, bit by bit.
And it's gonna take hard work but we can do it because we're Roses.
- And there is nothing we can't do - Alexis: Hi hi - Alexis: You're being super loud right now.
- David: I can hear you thought the headphones!
Alexis: So if you can just wrap it up in here.
David: 10 to a 5.
Thanks.
I feel good about this.
I really do.
What the hell is this?
The town sign.
Bag boy at the grocery store.
Which is what?
40, 45-something and hour?
"Good riddance," is what they said.
Are we having a bad day, honey?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1  Johnny: So, this is the town limits?
Ray: Yes sir, 4,500 acres that ends right here at the town sign.
And it's all yours, Johnny, it must be a nice feeling, considering you don't have a lot right now.
You know, because of the crooked business manager.
You know, the money scandal Yes, I know, I know, I know, Ray.
What the hell is this?
!
Ray: The town sign.
Johnny: Is this the real sign, or the joke sign?
Ray: What do you mean?
Johnny: You don't see anything wrong with this?
The man!
Standing awfully close to that woman, wouldn't you say?
Johnny: Well, he's holding on to her so she doesn't fall into the creek.
Johnny: Look a little closer, Ray.
Ray: Well, it need a little sprucing up.
- Johnny: Sprucing up?
!
- Ray: It's very popular, people come from all over to take a picture with it.
Johnny: I'll bet they do!
You know what?
This is coming down!
Ray: That's the mayor's family up there!
The sign's been here over forty years.
Johnny: And you wonder why this place won't sell?
Oh, I think I see it now.
His shoulders are too big.
Johnny: Get in the car, Ray.
Moira?
Boy, we've got our work cut out for us.
But I've seen worse.
It's not a problem.
Moira?
Moira:  They dare to call me irrelevant?
Shag carpeting, that's irrelevant!
L.A. is irrelevant I am relevant!
"Good riddance," is what they said.
Oh, who said that, sweetheart?
Moira: I don't know!
They're no name commentors.
- Tormentors.
- Are we having a bad day, honey?
Moira: Anonymous.
Ominous.
That'll be fine, thank you.
I'm afraid I don't have a gratuity right now.
Alexis: So, that guy from the other night.
- He's not for me, right?
- David: What guy?
That beardy guy that I kissed at the party.
He's gross, right?
Like, that's not a thing for me.
There wasn't like, a spark or anything.
You mean the hitchhiker that was burning meat over a garbage can?
Yeah, that one.
Have you seen your mother today?
Um yeah, she was face down on the carpet before dragging herself into the closet.
And you didn't say anything?
!
I thought she was maybe looking for a contact or something.
Johnny: Yeah, she googled herself again, now she's having one of her "things".
How bad is it?
Johnny: How bad is it?
A solid seven.
It's not an eight, which seems manageable for you.
Johnny: Well, except I've got a few things I have to take care of, so I need you two to go in, and take No, I did Saint-Tropez, so.
David: And I did her birthday, and Aspen twice.
Johnny: And I'm trying to sell this town.
So, if you kids want any chance of getting out of here, you'll help me out, and go in and look after your mother!
Well, my horoscope said that I shouldn't assume responsibility for anybody but myself today.
Johnny: Yeah, and my horoscope says, why don't you go in and help your mother!
And don't let her out of your sight, okay?
We don't want her detonating in public!
Alexis: I know!
Though it is kind of fun to watch, though.
Not when you're the one she's trying to back over with a car.
What's that?
- David: Eye cream.
- Johnny: From where?
David: From Paris.
How did you pay for it?
David: Oh, one of my credit cards is still working.
Johnny: Oh, you're charging things to your credit card?
!
I see, and how are you gonna pay for it?
David: I don't think you understand, I already have it.
Well, I know this is a bizarre concept for you, David, but if you want cream from Paris, you need a job, so you can pay for the cream from Paris!
Okay well, tell that to the bags under my eyes, then.
Johnny: And right after you tell your next joke, I want you to go down to the front desk, and ask what's-her-name Stevie.
Johnny: Where you can get a job around here!
All right?
I'm in the middle getting rid of an x-rated sign, before it scares off the few buyers we might actually have!
Okay, I'll get on that.
Johnny: You want the smooth under eyes of a 16-year-old, get a job!
You just need to relax, because it's not like your boyfriend left you for a Scandinavian flight attendant!
What kind of name is Kika anyway?
I'm the one that should be in the closet right now, not you.
Moira: Help me out.
- Moira: Help me!
- Alexis: Okay!
- Moira: Oh, shhh!
- My foot's fallen asleep.
Hey, shall we see what they're saying about you and Stavros?
Alexis: No!
Moira: It's not my idea!
Moira: You were a couple of doe eyed lovers aboard a trans-Atlantic airship filled with gas!
Alexis: You know what I think we should do?
I think we should go get something to eat, because when you're eating you can't be talking to me, okay?
- Moira: You know what I think?
- Alexis: What?
You date pigs.
Okay, I just remembered that being a mother is not your strong suit.
Oh darling, I'm only telling you because it's true!
Alexis: And because you gobbled down a hundred thousand anti-depressants this morning.
Moira: I was hungry!
But I could still eat.
David: Hi, um question.
If one were to theoretically look for a job here in Schitt's Creek, where would you suggest that that person go to look?
Is there, like, a bulletin board or a pamphlet, or something with information on it?
Stevie: No, no bulletin board What kind of job are you looking for?
David: Um, something in like, art curating, or trend forecasting.
Stevie: Oh, okay um, hmmm, let's see.
Not seeing anything in art curating, or trend forecasting, that's weird.
David: Okay.
Um, do you have any other skills or areas of expertise?
I've been told I have really good taste.
Oh, well, that's good.
Um, let's see Oh!
Bag boy at the grocery store.
I don't know what that is.
You put groceries in bags, so that people can carry their groceries out of the grocery store.
Okay, and how much do you think that would pay?
Mmm, I'm gonna say minimum wage.
Johnny: Which is what, forty, forty-five something an hour?
- Mmm-hmm, exactly.
- David: Okay.
Okay!
Um, well, something to think about.
For sure, thank you.
Stevie: You're welcome.
Moira: I would like two apple fritters, sliver of pecan pie, large fries with gravy and bacon!
Alexis: Okay, so, she will have scrambled egg whites and some steamed spinach, please, thank you.
Moira: And some pecan pie!
Onion rings, and ice cream!
Actually, none of that, and I will have a tea, thank you.
Okay.
Um, Mrs. Rose, are you okay?
You seem a bit - Alexis: Mm-hmm, she's fine.
- Moira: I'm fine.
Alexis: Um Hey!
Stay here, okay?
Don't move!
Oh wow, I'm really bored.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey you!
Hey!
Hey, so I just wanted to be clear about what happened the other night.
The reason that I let you kiss me.
Um, you kissed me.
Yeah, no, I can see how that would be confusing, but I just wanted to let you know that that was just me going through some stuff.
Cool.
Um, hey!
So, why do they give you table scraps?
Are you, like, a poor person, or?
Uh, no, but thanks for asking.
No, I use it to compost.
You know, that way nothing gets thrown out.
Composting?
Yeah, no, I I know composting.
Um, Gwyneth Paltrow does a compost gift exchange.
I'm gonna go.
Alexis: Okay, great, I'm glad that we could clear this up.
Bob: Speak of the devil.
Good morning.
- Ray!
Hi.
- Ray: Hi.
Johnny: I I just stopped by to make an appointment to see the town council.
Bob: You're looking at us.
I'm Bob, that's Ronnie, you know Ray.
Johnny: Yes, yes, Ray.
Spent a wonderful morning with Ray.
Well, I can see you've got a million things on your plate, so I'll get to the point, it's about the town sign.
I told you he wouldn't let this go!
The sign tells people what to expect when they're in town.
Do you have a problem with that message?
A major problem, Bob.
Yeah, you see, it's the first thing you see when you drive in, and as the owner of the town, I'd like to convey a better, cleaner image.
There's a lot of history in that sign, Johnny.
Schitt history.
Ronnie: That's all we need, some outsider coming in here and changing everything.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it!
- Hello, Moira!
- Moira:  Hi!
How are you?
I'm eating egg whites, and hoping the building will collapse.
Anyways, I have a giant favour.
My class is putting on a play for the younger grades, and I just thought that you'd be perfect, you know, to help coach the kids.
Because they'd be thrilled to have someone like you, an actual star teach them?
That must have taken such courage to ask me that.
But in show business boldness is rewarded, so my answer is yes.
Yes, yes!
- That is such good news!
- , I know!
So, how'd it go?
I met with a woman at a very sad grocery store, and I have a quote unquote interview to be a bag boy.
Johnny: Hey, that's great!
David: That's all that I'm apparently qualified to be.
When's the interview?
This afternoon.
Well, the interview's where you make your first good impression, so, it's gotta count.
I'm interviewing to be a bag boy, not a personal injury lawyer.
David, I've had enough people hire enough people in my day to know exactly what they're looking for in an interview, so, let's go!
Let's get up.
For what?
Come in!
Ah, David Rose.
You're applying for the bag boy position.
David: Yeah.
Johnny: Tell me David, why do you want this job?
I don't want this job.
Well, thank you very much, and don't expect a phone call!
- David: Okay.
- Johnny: All right, do it right!
Or let's not do it.
Now, we're gonna start again.
- David: Okay.
- Johnny: Tell me, David, why do you want this job?
I ran out of eye cream.
Okay, you're not gonna get this job.
You're not gonna get this job!
You know why?
Your attitude sucks!
- David: Okay - Johnny: And look at how you're dressed!
Johnny: What is this?
!
Colostomy bag pants!
I'm the manager of a family run grocery store.
I'm not gonna hire you!
You're not gonna get the job, you're the last person - David: Okay!
- Johnny: Where's your mother?
Alexis: Whew!
- Where's your mother?
- Alexis: What?
- Aaaaaah!
- Alexis: Aaah?
What?
!
- Johnny: Where's your mother?
!
- Alexis: She's with Jocelyn.
- Johnny: With Jocelyn?
- Alexis: She's fine!
And I'm fine too, if anybody cares.
I told you to watch her!
Alexis: I did watch her!
I watched her talk to Jocelyn.
Moira: Okay, how many of you beautiful young things have a background in the theater?
Raise your swords!
I see, a class grounded in realism, nice work.
Because that is where we find our deepest well.
May I be up front?
Jocelyn: Yes.
We're not here to play, or to have fun!
You will work until it hurts!
Hey, come here a second!
Hey, just the man I wanna see!
So word on the street is that you're all freaked out about the town sign, is that right?
No, no, I'm not freaked out about the town sign, I just And that you have some sort of problem with my family, - Roland: Or something, is that it?
!
- Johnny: No, no, no, this is not about your family.
- Roland: Oh, it's not?
- Johnny: It's not about your family.
- Roland: Oh, really?
Okay, interesting.
- Johnny: No, no, no.
In the car, come on!
In, let's go!
Come on, Kaylee, try this.
It's cool.
Tiffany: I can be cool without drugs, Mark!
Moira: Okay, stop!
No one speak.
Not a word!
It's not your fault, the script is garbage!
Okay, which one of you wrote this?
Jocelyn: I did.
Jocelyn, have you ever been addicted to drugs?
No!
Then write what you know, okay?
The quiet suffering of a woman trapped in a relationship with a simpleton.
That's not what I know Moira, and drug awareness is part of the curriculum, so.
I'm gonna work with these two.
What is it that you want?
To go home.
Is that where you keep the stash?
You want the marijuana?
Yes?
Moira: No, you want to be seen, and heard, and loved!
Now, what is it you need?
It's different, be careful, what is it you need?
What is it you need?
Okay.
Ahem!
Hey!
Um, were you working out or something?
Or Ah, sort of.
Okay, well, I'm sorry for interrupting.
Um, I just I happened to be in the area, so Twyla: Mutt?
Mutt: Um just Alexis!
Twyla!
I didn't know you two were uh Did you wanna come in?
I was just about to make some tea.
Alexis: Mmm, no, I'm good.
Uh, I should be getting back to my mom, who's not well, yeah, so, I'm gonna go.
- Mutt: Okay.
- Twyla: Oh.
You guys have fun!
Thanks!
Alexis: Bye!
Blaaaaah!
Roland: That is my great grandfather up there, Horace Schitt.
He was a visionary, Johnny!
He discovered this land, he developed it, and he turned it into the little slice of heaven that it is.
And I'm proud of him!
You understand that?
Roland, you've got this all wrong.
Why do you hate me?
I don't hate you!
I don't hate you!
Well then, why do you have a problem with a sign that celebrates my family?
It's not, it's just the way they're celebrating, that's all!
Roland: Okay, so now you hate my family.
Johnny: I don't hate your family!
Roland: Well then, what is your big fat problem with the sign?
!
Johnny: It looks like your great grandfather's  your great grandmother right up the ass!
Oh my go that is so demented!
You can't tell me you don't see that!
Well, you know, now that you put that creepy thought in my head, sure, I I see it, but you got it all wrong, pal!
Let me enlighten you, Mr. Johnny Rose!
That isn't even Horace's wife!
That's his sister.
Well, how does that make it any better?
Ohhh!
Well, I don't know how they do things where you come from, but around these parts, we don't do that sort of thing with our sisters!
Roland, how is anybody driving past this sign supposed to know the woman getting banged from behind is that man's sister?
!
- Roland: Oh my.
- Johnny: Oh my!
Yes, oh my!
All right, Johnny, well I never really looked at it that way, but now I get it, okay, well, all right, I'll do something about it, I'll fix it, all right?
And thank you, thank you for bringing that up to me.
Johnny: Good.
Good!
Jocelyn, we're going off book!
Jocelyn: Well, actually, we're running out of time.
Forget the lines, forget the lines!
Let's just be in character, shall we?
Oh, could you be stiffer?
!
Just watch, please.
Ahem!
Start wherever.
Um Do you wanna smoke a joint?
Oh Mark, you are better than this.
You can't let others define you.
Look at me!
Never let the bastards get you down!
-  Can't say bastard!
- Okay.
You must prepare for life, and whatever it will throw at you.
The opportunities will diminish, and the ass will get bigger, oh, you can bet your bottom dollar it will!
Especially yours.
You're going to have a huge ass.
And you, future baldy.
Sorry, hairless, homeless!
So what?
Who cares?
When they get mean, you tell them to go to hell!
Because only you know who you are!
And those cruel Internet people cannot take that away from you!
You will forge on!
And you will find some glimmer of something to hold on to.
And only then will you find your way back.
Only then will you become once again who you are!
Lady standing!
Good, you're gettin' the hang of it.
David: Well, putting groceries in a bag is not as complicated as one might think.
Store manager: Watch the eggs.
What did I say?
David: You said put them in a separate bag.
Store manager: Good.
Quick learner.
Woman on P.A.: David Rose, line one.
David: Sorry, I just gotta just one thank you.
Hello?
Hey, how's it going?
Yeah, I can't talk right now, so.
Johnny: Ah, they're working you hard, huh?
Yeah, I can't talk, so I'm gonna hang up, bye.
Sorry, sorry about that.
Someone's on a health kick, huh?
Woman on P.A.: David Rose, line one.
I'm just gonna scoot past.
- Yeah?
- Johnny: You hung up.
Sorry.
Okay.
Where were we?
Woman on P.A.:  David Rose, line one!
Right.
Take that off.
Hand that to you.
Now I'm gonna I'm gonna go.
This is worse.
This is much worse!
- David: You did this?
- Johnny: No, I didn't do this, I tried to fix this!
Well, it it is what it is.
Okay, it looks like I know what it looks like, Alexis!
I know!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Oh, those unsightly rolls Oh, that unattractive austere diet Oh-ho-ho those stubborn thighs.
Say goodbye to ugly fat!
Say David?
Can you come here please?
Exercise miracle you've ever seen!
David, can you come in here please?
!
What?
Well, come in here and I'll tell you.
- Well, why don't you just tell me from there?
- David - You could've already told me.
- I want to speak face to face.
Motels this size we're basically always face to face.
In the same room.
Why are you yelling?
I'm right here.
I want you to move your clothes.
- I did.
- Out of my closet.
You've got t-shirts on hangers.
I've nowhere to hang my clothes.
Well, put them over the t-shirts then.
- Moira - Alexis!
No, no, it's David I want.
I need to speak with our daughter.
Good luck.
Oh my God!
Where did you hear that?
!
Yeah?
What is it?
I need you to fill this out please.
Fill what out?
Your community service papers.
As our only delinquent, I hope it's not asking too much.
I still have to do that?
Generally, that's how it works, honey.
When you break the law, you've gotta serve your sentence.
Well, it was one DUI.
Please, before I lose my mind.
I don't get it.
It's all done.
No, there's still a little bit that needs to be filled in.
Um all that's missing is my middle name.
Then fill it in please.
Do I have to do that?
Why must you be so constantly irksome?
Do you not know my middle name?
Of course I do.
I blessed you with it.
Okay, so um then what name should I put down then?
Alexis, do as your mother says, please.
Do you know my middle?
If I said, "Anna" I can't believe this.
Alexis something rose.
We have so many disasters bombarding us right now, my dear, the middle name of an ungrateful child is hardly a priority.
Wait.
Alexis has a middle name?
Why is this the first time hearing of this?
Do do I have a middle name?
Now you come into the room.
Have we failed them, John?
I'm worried about our children.
Are we terrible parents?
Terrible parents?
!
We sent them to the best boarding schools, we hired the best nannies We did everything right.
I mean, they're not overly affectionate with us and, uh, there's a lot more disrespect than I'd like, but, uh, no, we're good parents.
But who are they?
Well, it might be nice to get to know them better, I suppose.
Wouldn't it, John?
But who has time amidst all this chaos?
Mm.
I get it.
So what's your deal?
You're pretty.
What's that like?
Um it's good.
Yeah, lots of doors open up for pretty people.
Mm-hmm, clearly, as I register for community service.
So what'd you do?
Um I drove into the Prada Store on Rodeo Drive.
In fairness, it did look a lot like, um, the entrance to a parking garage.
Uh-huh.
And I was high at the time.
Are you high right now?
No, I'm not.
Well, you might wanna be, 'cause this isn't exactly thrilling work.
And you won't be gettin' any chit chat from your buddy.
What buddy?
You're not the only druggy in town, Hun?
- Ronnie.
- Mm.
Here's your garbage stick.
You use it to pick up garbage.
And here Oh no, I'm fine.
Thank you, that's very sweet.
This isn't say yes to the dress, princess.
Orange is the new orange.
'Kay.
Who needs 14 Grey suits?
What am I supposed to do with my dry clean onlys?
!
I'm still trying to figure out why you'd own more than one piece of clothing you can't put in a washing machine.
You try putting a cashmere sweater in the washing machine.
It'll bite your wrist.
That's a problem I'd like to have.
Are these all your clothes?
Yeah.
What's this, then?
That's a sweater.
It's one chromosome away from a crocheted blanket.
What?
It's just your clothes, they're all kind of funky.
Funky?
Yeah.
Funky.
Yeah, no, no, no.
I'm just trying to figure out What about this What about this is funky?
I'm just having a hard time understanding.
It's just, you know, like funky.
Different.
Yeah, funky is a neon t-shirt you buy at an airport gift shop, next to a bejeweled iPhone case.
This this is luxury.
There's a lot of stuff here.
Have you ever considered selling some of this.
These are my things.
I've hand-selected each of these things; they mean a lot to me.
How much do you think I can get for this?
So you got busted for selling drugs?
Like hard drugs?
Like Did you wear a Hazmat suit and work in a trailer?
No.
It was just weed and mushrooms, uppers.
Mostly to truckers and my high school teachers.
Mm-hmm.
It's actually pretty clean around here, which is shocking considering the state of our motel room.
Speaking of unfit homes, why do you live in a barn?
What's wrong with living in a barn?
Mm nothing, if you're a goat.
Well, it serves its purpose.
It seems to With the ladies.
That's just a joke.
I'm sorry for walking in on you and Twyla the other day.
No, it's cool.
So how long have you two been together- So, listen, I gotta take off for a bit.
I got this thing I gotta do.
Can you cover for me?
- Um I mean - Cool.
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
Sorry.
Excuse me!
What am I supposed to keep doing here?
I feel like we should break these into categories.
Um fit, fabric, and nationality.
Or we could do this.
I um - Keep or sell?
- Well, those are- - Keep or sell.
- Uh - Just keep or sell.
- Sell.
Sell them.
I got these at a showroom in Paris.
I got these on clearance rack at Target.
- $850.
- 850 what?
Eight hundred-dollars?
!
- $850 dollars.
- $850 dollars?
These are a collector's.
There's a woman in Paris that makes them by hand, so My car's worth less than your pants.
Well, I've seen your car and that makes sense to me.
Okay then.
Right.
We'll try to get $850 dollars for your pants.
Keep or sell?
I don't know.
Oh You know, I think the reason our kids are so casual with us is because they think of us as their friends.
Hmm, no.
No, it's obvious.
It's obvious, Moira, right?
Because we're hip parents.
- Oh, John - And that comes at a price.
John, we're not hip.
I'm hipper than you but in our childrens' eyes we are the polar antonym of hip.
Well, somehow we've lost touch with our kids.
We've become complete strangers.
Hey!
Have we decided?
Just coffee, please.
Uh Twyla, do you get along with your parents?
I did.
It's a little different now.
My mom has this thing where half the time she thinks I'm her cousin Angela.
And it's getting harder and harder to coordinate visitation times with my dad in prison.
I'm sorry I asked.
Oh, that's okay!
I'll get you your coffees.
Your mother and I have been talking and we've come to the realization that we've not been very good parents.
Sadly, and most of the time, we have no interest in what's going on with you.
We have no idea what.
'Cause she means no idea.
We have lost touch as a family and if we're gonna get through this ordeal together, we have got to get reacquainted.
Now, back at Rose Video, we had management retreats where we would play fun team-building exercises- You also had company-wide spa days.
Why don't we try that?
And one of the ice breakers at these retreats was a game that was always a hit.
And it was a game where somebody would tell a lie about themselves, and then a truth, and then another lie, and everybody would have to guess which one was the lie.
No, Johnny, they had to guess which one was the truth.
Mm which one was the lie.
It's just-it's just one lie.
- What did I say?
- You said two lies.
- Well, it is two lies.
- No, it's No, the game is "two truths and a lie".
- It's truth.
- That's the game.
So you've heard of it.
You've heard of it.
Well, yeah, because babies play that at their birthday parties.
Okay, whatever.
It's a good game.
Okay?
Now, here's how it goes.
I'll give you an example.
Why don't I start?
Um, I'm miserable, drunk, and hate this game.
So here's a hint Sadly, I'm not drunk.
Okay, wrong attitude.
That's the wrong-right off the top!
Okay, my turn, my turn, my turn.
Um okay.
My eyes are brown, I am basically sample-sized, and one time I escaped from a Thai drug lord's car trunk by bribing him with sex.
Right idea, honey, but you know what?
It's gotta be more challenging for everybody- Her eyes are aqua.
You did what?
I'm kidding!
I clearly would never bribe anybody with sex.
When were you in Thailand?
!
I told you that I was on spring break.
Everyone can just calm down because Aroon was a lovely gentleman until he ran out of money.
How many people do you know that are currently in the prison system?
- Is it like twelve?
- Um, I'm pretty sure just two.
All right, that's enough.
Good game.
Good game, everybody!
Alexis you're grounded.
No!
That was ten years ago, and everybody does dumb stuff in high school.
You were 17?
!
Did you know this?
As if.
I don't do girl talk.
Okay, everybody does dumb stuff everywhere.
For example, I saw Mutt today the guy that lives in the barn making out with the mayor's wife.
- What's-her-face?
!
- Mm-hmm.
And the homeless kid?
Mm-hmm.
Guys like that will bone anything.
- Well, not anything.
- Stop.
- 'Cause that would mean - Stop.
Stop.
- That would include - Stop it.
- You.
Which it doesn't.
- Don't.
Ew.
You know, I remember when Alexis was just a chubby-faced little girl racing around the house in that banned babywalker, and now she's spending time In a drug lord's trunk?
!
Oh, that is my favourite Liam Neeson movie.
Johnny.
Johnny, look who's come in.
Is it true?
Politician's neglected wife sleeps with a ranch hand.
- I love it.
- He's not a ranch hand.
He's a vagrant in a barn.
- Hi there!
- Moira.
- Jocelyn.
Hi.
- Johnny, hi.
You look amazing.
Utterly alive.
I don't feel it.
My lower back is completely shot.
Oh, dear.
Why would that be?
Age?
Even the slightest twitch in bed throws it out.
Perhaps a new position would help?
Would like to join us?
No, I ate already.
Couldn't put another thing in my mouth.
Well, that's Okay.
All right then.
Oh my God.
They sell all kinds of stuff.
- Hey, Wayne.
- Hey, Stevie.
Um so this is my friend David.
David Rose.
What are your consignment percentages?
Uh, this is a thrift shop.
Okay.
Do you have sales representative?
Who will be pricing these items?
Uh me.
Okay.
Is there a problem, Wayne?
It's just I can't really use any of this.
It's too, you know Funky?
Sure.
Let's go with that.
Okay, let's take your oily hands off my clothes.
You sure you can't take any of this stuff?
Some of this stuff's pretty good.
Um maybe we can use the sneakers.
Maybe the sneakers?
This is French suede, with a vulcanized-rubber instep, okay?
You've lost my trust and my business, so We'll be leaving now.
- Sorry.
- What is this place?
What is this place?
!
Ha!
Ugh!
So what happened to you yesterday?
What happened to me?
Yeah, I came back you were gone.
Well, I had to do most of the shift by myself.
So thank God I had my rape whistle.
Sorry.
I had some stuff I had to take care of.
And did you get your stuff taken care of?
Yeah, I guess.
'Cause it It seems to me like you get your stuff taken care of pretty regularly.
By multiple people, if you know what I mean.
I don't.
Look, I know you probably think that you're this handsome man around town who's like Handsome, mysterious And handsome and homeless-y but you're better than that, you know?
What?
Like, I don't judge.
Trust me.
I have been I have been in the middle of some very messy group scenarios and I know how weird it can be, so Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm just saying that your secret is safe with me.
Wink.
Let me just say, I get it.
How much can one person take?
Well, may-maybe this is not our place, Moira.
And where does all that pent up energy go?
I should go.
- Hey - Hey.
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you all morning.
Around.
Doing stuff.
Well, I tried calling you.
I must have turned my phone off by mistake.
Joce, did you see him again today?
See who?
Oh, geez, you know I told you, you can see him as much as you want, just don't keep it a secret from me, okay?
I wanna know everything you two are doing.
Look, half the time I'm there he doesn't even want me there.
I just can't help myself.
- Well, you love him.
- Yeah.
I love him too, but the kid's an idiot.
It's our son, Mutt.
We're talking about our son.
- Yeah.
- Oh!
- Our son.
- Oh!
You done with that?
Got it.
No, I wasn't.
I wasn't uh Yeah, he turned into a real nutbar.
Doesn't drive in cars, he won't use anything plastic.
Good luck with birth control, right?
And then we see you with your kids and you're so together.
What's your secret?
Listening is so very important.
So important to listen To your kids.
See, Roland?
Listening.
Excuse me, I listen to the kid.
If he'd listened to me, he wouldn't be sitting in a hut, making his own underwear.
The Internet is a breeding ground for freaks.
What're you doing?
Well, I just "sold" a pair of sunglasses on here and now dieforfash87 is telling me she won't pay 'cause she thinks they're fake.
Okay.
Um How about we move away- No!
I don't even wanna sell these things.
These clothes are all that I have.
Everything else has been taken from me.
Well, you have your family What's your point?
I am having a very hard time right now dealing with the idea that people think that my things are worthless, - Or funky, or - Sorry.
fake.
Does it look like I shop on Canal Street?
No Okay.
People here don't know anything, okay?
Wayne huffs keyboard cleaner for a living.
Well, that's not surprising.
You're playing to the wrong crowd.
You're-you have great clothes.
I like some of this stuff.
Like like this.
Like, I like this.
Ooh!
Ooh I like this.
This gives me an idea.
So why would I sleep with my mother?
Well, now that I know that she's your mother, that makes a lot more sense to me.
And you normally go around spying on people?
Um, you left me here to be abducted by long haul truckers.
I just went to find you.
So why are you sneaking around with your mom anyway?
What's the big secret?
It's my dad.
We don't really get along.
He really takes the whole mayor tradition in the family thing seriously and I'm just not that down into labels, you know?
- "Labels"?
- Yeah.
And you wonder why I make fun of you.
Oh, and you are totally in sync with your parents?
Um yeah, because they always wanted a daughter with a record, who dropped out of college, so Pretty much delivered on that one.
Ugh!
Oh!
Okay, this is gonna cheer you up.
So I thought you might be lonely without your clothes.
So if this isn't too dirty for you, I could help take care of your stuff.
Wait, you wanna have sex with me?
No.
I don't think anybody has sex in here unless they're being paid for it.
I thought this might be a good place to store your clothes.
Is this a safe place?
Yes.
I'm the only with a key.
But there's a catch.
I get to wear whatever I want, anytime I want.
Fine.
Wow!
Our son's clothes are no longer in our closet.
Something I said finally got through.
I just found somewhere else to put them.
I can't hear you from in there.
I found somewhere else to put them!
Well, subconsciously I got through.
David?
Alexis?
Can you come here please?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe the text I got from her saying you left your ring in the sauna David?
!
Alexis?
!
They're not going to come, dear.
Well, how widespread is that news?
I can hear the Deal sign.
Talk about salacious!
He had long day at work.
I ran into Tanya on the street.
He cut off his what?
!
- Wait, what?
Okay.
- How did it happen?
Look, I just, uh I just want to make sure that, uh, you know, we're all okay.
What were we not okay about?
About your mother and me feeling disconnected from you two.
We are literally connected by a door that does not lock.
How much how much more connected do you wanna be?
Emma.
Your middle name is "Emma".
Is it?
So, we'll keep working away at this.
I'm sorry!
No, Hannah.
I'm embarrassed for you.
- Well, that's that then.
- Elspeth.
- No!
- Wow.
I think it's Elspeth.
- It isn't!
- I should know!
Wow.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Oh yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Could you spare some a Oh my go-oh my God!
- David!
- Where's my robe?
!
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God, what's happening?
I saw hell is what's happening.
Oh my God.
What?
- Oh my God.
- David, what you just saw was your mother and me - I know what I saw.
- having an intimate moment.
- I cannot unsee that!
- Oh my God, you poor thing!
Okay, and I refuse to feel guilty about being in bed with my wife.
- Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
- I hate to be the one to tell you, but having sex is not just about making children so they can grow up and make you feel bad about having sex.
Oh my God, can you stop this please?
!
I will not be shamed.
Shame on you.
Shame on you for attempting that position at 8 o'clock in the morning.
- John?
- You know what?
- Oh my God.
- Do you know how difficult it is for us to share a wall with you two?
- I do now.
- Yes, well, if you don't mind, we are now going back into our room and don't even think about opening that door!
- Are you serious?
- Next time.
Oh my God.
No, no, no S01E05 The Cabin Roland, I just need the door fixed.
- Mm-hmm?
- Okay?
My family can't keep living like this.
My wife and I, we have no privacy.
Okay, all right.
I get what this is about.
You and the wife wanna bump the old uglies, huh?
I have no idea what that means.
Having a little problem down there below there, Johnny boy, huh?
No, there's no problem, Roland, I just need the locks fixed!
It's okay, I get it.
I get it, captain.
You've been a out to sea for a while you wanna bring the boat into port and maybe get your mast scrubbed.
What're you guys down to now?
Like twice a day?
Okay, this is a conversation you and I will never have, all right?
I just need the door fixed.
Well, how 'bout I do you one better?
We got a cabin up by the lake.
It's just a little love nest for the lady and me.
You know, when we wanna spark the old spark from time to time.
My gift to you and yours for the night.
So generous, but I'm gonna take a pass.
- Hey, Johnny.
- Jocelyn?
- How are you?
- Uh, good.
Good.
Sex life's in the crapper.
I just offered him the cabin.
That is so not true.
- I knew something was wrong.
- N-nothing is wrong.
You should take the cabin.
I wouldn't wanna see your relationship get any worse.
No, our relationship is fine.
It's just a privacy issue Johnny, Johnny, come on, come on, come on, come on.
Take the cabin, okay?
And feel free to use the restraints.
- We keep 'em under the bed, so - Thank you.
Thank you.
- Pick a safe word.
- Mm.
I, for one, think we should take them up on their offer.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
We're talking about Roland's place.
Who knows what the hell we're gonna find up there?
Well, we can't share any real intimacy here in this internment camp, John, and I don't want to turn into my parents.
Separate beds, separate rooms.
Well, separate countries.
Exactly!
A bad marriage!
Hey, if you're willing to give this a shot, I'm game.
- You're game.
- Yeah.
Okay.
I'll play.
Actually, I have a good feeling about this, John.
You know, I'm starting to get a pretty good feeling myself.
Are you?
Oh my God!
Am I being punished for something?
David, are you dirty peeping tom?
I don't' think parenting books would approve of you saying that to me.
I'm here to grab a magazine, and go back and leave you guys to whatever disgusting - Stay.
- Stick around, stick around.
- Alexis?
- Alexis!
They're done!
Your father and I have some very important news.
If you tell me that you're pregnant, I'm gonna vomit on this floor right now.
- Oh, can you imagine?
- We're planning a trip.
- Okay.
- Just to a cabin, overnight And we request that the two of you not try to contact us for the next 24 hours.
I really appreciate you doing that for me.
I'm doing it for us.
Well, it's to my benefit.
Um, why don't you guys stay at the cabin for longer?
Oh, I would never just abandon you two in a motel in the middle of nowhere.
Didn't you once take the wrong baby home from preschool?
Alexis looked Chinese as an infant.
How many times must I defend myself?
So we're good then?
Thank you.
- No, thank you.
- No, thank you.
- Honestly, thank you.
- Enough, David!
Thank you so much for the loan of your cabin and your truck.
Looks like you folks got a lot of gear here, huh?
Is that the tickle trunk?
It's just clothes.
Yeah, okay, but just keep in mind there's only 60 amp service there, so don't be pluggin' a lot of gadgets in all at once, if you know what I mean.
Yet another disturbing look into his world.
All right, directions.
Super easy, Johnny.
Here's what I want you to do.
Okay, I want you take highway 10 to Loon Lake Road north, okay?
I want you to take a right there.
There's gonna be a split in the fence, I want you to go left at that split, and keep going.
Go through the intersection of Loon Lake Road south, okay?
And then you're gonna find Pine Road.
Now you go up Pine Road, I want you take a right at that big oak tree, all right?
It's old, it's big, you can't miss it.
You go down the hill to the left and we're the third cabin on the right, okay?
The key's under the mat.
- Got it.
- Really?
Key is under the mat.
So I think I'm gonna go next door because your mess is making me anxious.
What mess?
You know how clean my apartment was in New York.
It was so clean.
It was really clean.
Well, it was very clean because you had a maid to keep it very clean for you.
No.
I kept it clean after Cecilia cleaned.
Anyway, I think it's best if we just take some space and um I am looking forward to sleeping in a bed that his not made for a toddler.
Okay.
I'll just chill here in my own space and Yeah.
Maybe I'll do a mask or something and check in with myself and see how I'm doing Okay, so we're good?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
See you tomorrow.
Okay.
I'm out of mask.
I was so bored in there!
I'm sorry to hear that.
Okay, so I think that we should take advantage of mom and dad being gone.
I am.
Okay, but like throwing a party or something.
No.
Absolutely not.
Just a tiny, little, casual motel party.
Okay, Alexis, I have no interest in finding out what types of people are attracted to "casual motel parties".
But you do have an interest in lounging on a bed that mom and dad have had sex all over?
Why would you do that to me right now?
David, I just I miss my life!
And I miss doing things.
And I miss being surrounded by loose acquaintances who think that I'm funny, and smart, and charming.
Will you?
Just a few people.
Please.
You can't tell me that you don't wanna hang out with people other than me.
- Obviously.
- Okay, so?
- Okay, fine.
Something small.
- Yes!
Like a little games night.
Yes, like a small, little games night party.
No.
Like a little games night period.
Okay, fine.
And then, if it turns into something else, it turns into something else.
Well, it won't 'cause there's only six people invited.
Any more and game play gets too yelly.
It gets very yelly.
Okay, this party is gonna be - It's not a party.
- awesome!
- It's not a party.
- So.
Much.
Fun!
I'm so excited!
Hey, not bad!
Rustic but nice, huh?
The great outdoors, Moira.
I am shocked and delighted.
Yes.
I have to say I was nervous about this, but I've gotta hand it to Roland, he came through.
He's moron!
Key's under the mat, is it?
The key is under the mat!
Agh!
That's great!
Lying son-of-a Agh!
Idiot man!
Moron!
Ha!
Oh, good.
- John?
!
- Yeah!
Coming, honey!
I'm coming.
Well hellooooo.
Oh, my car broke down and it's raining, and I wondered if I might spend the night.
Well, first let's get you out of those dry clothes and we'll see where the night takes us.
So I need to flesh out this games night thing.
Between you and my sister, and the barn guy and that girl in the restaurant, we have 5, and obviously we need an even 6 for ultimate game play.
Well, what if I'm not a games person?
We're far too similar for you not to be, so Options, please.
Obviously they need to be funny, and smart, and have well-rounded sense of humour and a wide range of knowledge.
Oh, all those types of people move away from here.
- That's funny.
- No, I'm serious.
- Ooh, what about Eric?
- Hmm?
He finished high school.
I don't love his look.
Oh, looks are important?
Oh Why don't we throw a pageant?
Trust me, if I had time, we would, but we don't, so What about Sarah?
She's cute and speaks english.
Hmm?
Mm She get it?
- Get what?
- Like "get it" get it.
It, like the vibe.
Understand that games night needs to run a certain way, otherwise it won't work.
Can I be on your team?
You sound really fun.
Listen, you don't have to help me out if you don't want to.
- I can find someone else.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
- Well, it's-okay.
- Have fun.
- Okay.
- My money's on the other team.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I just uh Came to apologize.
For what?
For uninviting you to games night.
You did not uninvite me.
I uninvited myself.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, well, um I would really like it if you came and I would really love it if you could bring one other person of your choosing.
So it doesn't matter if they don't blend?
M-mm-mm.
And this doesn't have anything to do with the fact that you couldn't find anybody else to come?
No.
What?
No.
I You are a very bright, funny person, with a wide range of useful knowledge and the fact that we don't have an ideal number for team style game-play, is not not why I'm here.
You're such a liar.
And I was bluffing when I said I wasn't coming.
I just wanted to see you beg, so - Okay.
- I'll put out some feelers, but, you know, such short notice, all the town hotties will have plans.
I'll see you tonight!
Yeah, thanks.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
This place is almost charming.
Very rustic cottage.
I was half expecting early unibomber.
Oh, look!
Roland and Jocelyn.
Who are the other two?
Well, that's Bob.
He's on the town council.
And his partner?
Roland has gay friends!
Again, shocked and delighted.
I think that's his wife.
No, they're both called husband.
Look at the them smiling away.
What have they got to be so happy about?
Well, they have no money issues.
That's why they're so happy.
Yeah, they just don't know any better.
So, Eric, how do you know Stevie?
She used to be my babysitter.
Great.
Wow.
Okay.
And how are your Trivia skills?
- My what?
- Oh my God.
Okay.
Good choice.
Good choice.
You guys came.
Together.
That's so cute!
Come in!
Twyla, you look amazing!
Mutt, you look like a mill dollars.
Okay, so I brought this pie from work but on the way, I realized I didn't check what kind so there's a 50/50 chance there's meat in it.
Oh my God, that's so cute.
Thank you.
Okay, so it's 8:15.
It's 8:15.
We should have started at 8.
So fifteen minutes late, let's sit down and I will explain the game.
And I would just like to thank everybody so much for coming.
This is the first social thing that I've done in like a really long time, so let's just have so much fun and we'll just see where the night takes us.
Well, it'll take us to a three part games night that ends at 10.
Okay, well, we'll see.
- Okay, so let's start.
- Okay.
Let's start by putting down 10 famous names onto the pieces of paper in front of you.
I don't think I can fit ten names on this piece of paper.
That's funny.
That's funny.
No.
One per piece of paper.
Ten pieces of paper, ten names.
- Who should I put down?
- I can't tell you that, Eric, 'cause that would wreck the game.
So then how do I know what to put?
- Oh my God.
- Relax.
Can you put yourself down?
Oh, okay, who wants a shot?
Because I do.
No, we need to finish putting the names down first.
Who's that?
Okay, I may or may not have invited a few other people.
- What kind-who?
- I don't know.
I met them on the way home.
- Hey!
- Hey.
- How are you?
- Good, good.
- Good.
Hey!
- Hey, kids.
Stevie Mutt Twyla.
- Hey, Dane.
- Who the Bleep is this?
He's the worst, okay?
So just breathe through it.
Hi.
David Rose.
Oh 'Kay.
So we have split into teams and that's an odd number, so we're stuck.
No worries.
We're here for the party.
Keg's in the truck.
What kegs?
No one ordered a keg.
David, can you please not be rude in front of - Dane.
- Dane?
- So now what?
- Oh, God!
In the bowl, Eric.
Put them in the - Wow.
- Yeah.
I can't see out of one eye.
But I'm still alive, that's the main thing.
I'm hungry.
Should I go get No!
No.
You don't have to get anything.
I will get some food, I will get the wine.
You have done more than enough.
Oh good, you're done.
We uh we didn't wanna interrupt.
What're doing here?
Oh, just finishing off the latest Harold Zable novel.
- You ever read him?
- How long have you been here?
Quite a while.
Yeah, you seemed to have a little trouble there, getting going.
And, uh, well, we uh We didn't think you needed the extra pressure on you, so Oh, hi!
You're good.
And you are?
I'm Bob, this is my wife Gwen, and, uh, this is our cabin.
Oh, no, no, no.
This is Roland and Jocelyn's cabin.
No, they're a mile up the road.
Big tree, a fence.
You can't miss it.
She died!
She's a dead person!
- Marilyn Monroe!
- No!
She helps people!
- Oprah.
- Calcutta!
Calcutta!
- Calcutta!
The lepers!
- She's the mother She's a mother It's not your turn, Alexis!
- Princess Diana.
- No!
She's The lepers in Calcutta, she helps them.
- Lepers!
Lepers!
- There's all these lepers.
Stop yelling at her though!
It's the point of the game is the yell!
She's a mother and has your cousin's name.
Teresa?
- Mother Teresa!
- Yes!
You can't say mother!
You can't say mother!
- She wasn't getting it.
- That's the point!
Anyway, no points for them.
We have to start this again.
- This party's terrible.
- Excuse me?
Okay, so then, hey, why don't we do something else, like a drinking game.
No!
Absolutely not!
Every time the vein in my brother's eye twitches, we take a drink.
Why would you bring up my eye in front of all these people?
- Who is that?
!
- Calm down.
Dane thought he should just invite over a few more of his friends, so - Oh, did he?
- Yeah.
Who's up for strip poker?
Okay, you know what?
I'm out.
No, that's it.
I'm gonna call it a night.
I'm gonna pack it in.
Eric, don't look at my eye!
Why are you being such an old woman?
I'm sorry that I wanted to have fun tonight and invite a few random guys over and try and make out with them, okay?
You're not the only one dying in this town.
It is boring and I am just trying to make the best of it.
I'm really sorry everybody.
No offense, okay?
I'm well-versed in family conflict I'm sure you are.
Alexis?
If you want to party, have a party.
But I have a queen bed next door with my name on it and I have been looking forward to sleeping in that bed all day, so Maybe we should go.
No.
You know what, guys?
It's totally fine.
David, I would love it if you would come and party with us, but it's totally up to you.
And I'm totally gonna go.
So everybody have a good night.
I don't know who you are!
Dane, put that down and get off my bed!
No one on my bed tonight.
And don't-no one throw up!
So his eye twitched five times, so drink up, bitches!
- All right!
- Woo!
Shots!
All right.
Ready and And once again, my apologies.
And I'm sorry, I don't know how to make a bed.
And I may have damaged your corkscrew, Bob.
You broke it in half.
Okay, the door, it won't open.
The door won't open.
- It's locked.
- Oh, it's locked.
What do you want from us?
Yes, it's it's locked to prevent strangers from coming into the cabin.
See, uh, we didn't realize that, uh, strangers would already be in the cabin when we locked it.
I see.
Oh.
Okay.
Bye!
- There we go.
- Thank you.
Bye.
You've been consummate hosts, really.
Fantastic day.
Hey, Mutt, can you pass me a drink?
Um - Sorry.
Hey!
- Hi!
Here's the thing.
Um, I'm sorry that you and your sister are in a domestic, and I'm sorry that I invited Eric.
That joke was funnier in theory.
Bad joke.
But I'm gonna need you to come back in there.
Why?
Because I don't really like most of those people and, believe it or not, we are in the middle of a very intense game of drunken charades and my team is losing.
Badly.
Well, that's not really my thing.
It's not my thing either, but you were right; We're way too similar and I am having a very hard time losing, so I will happily let you get back to this big queen bed if you'll just help us win a few more rounds.
Just need somebody sober.
- I can't - Please.
Go back in there.
It's embarrassing.
They are way too drunk to remember.
Just two winning rounds and then it's over.
Then you can go back to your book.
- Fine.
Fine.
Two rounds.
- You can go back to sleep.
- Quick.
Quick rounds.
- Thank you.
- Fine.
- Thank you.
And just don't look at the stain on your bed, and we'll mime something special.
- What stain?
- Uh You're lucky I'm good at this game.
- Yes!
A mexican - Just get this one!
Are you sure you don't want to call a tradesman or someone, John?
Moira, I don't need a tradesman.
I can handle a screwdriver, okay?
This is working out just fine.
And that is in.
Look at this.
Instant lock.
Yes, let me tell you, Eddie.
You look awfully good in that blue collar.
Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Rose.
I don't often get compliments when I'm fixing doors.
Oh, Edward, I'm afraid I must tell you, I shan't be able to pay you today.
Well, that's okay, Mrs. Rose.
Maybe there's um some other way you can pay me, if you get my drift.
Did you take my mask?
Thank you.
Well, maybe I'll use a bigger screw, Mrs. Rose.
Don't you go anywheres.
I'll be right here, Eddie.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Hey, Moira, could you turn that down please?
Important call coming through.
Stevie says it's the guy from the winery.
Hmm.
Hello, Johnny Rose.
Hello?
Hello?
Ah.
Stevie?
- I put it through!
- Okay.
- Who is it?
- Herb Ertlinger.
- Excuse me?
- Herb Ertlinger from the winery.
He's the only guy that's gotten back to me on my proposal.
And-and now the ph- Hi!
Hello!
There's something wrong with the phones!
John, have her patch it through to the kids' room.
Yeah, patch it through to the kids' room!
Okay!
Very good suggestion!
Kids!
David, answer the phone!
He has his headphones in; He can't hear it.
- Then you answer it!
- Okay!
Hello?
Alexis, could you open the door, please?
I'll take it.
No, sorry, you have the wrong room.
He's actually in room 6.
Alexis, unlock the door please!
Okay!
No problem.
Bye.
He's gonna call you back in your room!
No!
Hello?
Can you get a heart murmur from a lack of sleep?
Because I have not slept since we've got here and I think my body is shutting down.
Well, I hate to admit it, but I actually know very little about heart murmurs.
Well, I have one.
Uh, the pulse is very irregular.
Honestly, David, I have tried to find my pulse like a thousand times and nothing.
So don't worry about it.
No, this is very serious!
My heart has not rested in a long time, my immune system is very low, I have not been able to find kale anywhere here- how long are we going to be talking about you for?
I think I'm having a heart attack, is what's happening!
David, you are like 34.
I'm basically 29.
Oh my God, you are overreacting.
I think you're gonna feel very guilty when I slip into a coma and you have to come visit me in the hospital at hospice.
Well, I'm gonna go for a jog, so don't die until I get back.
Well, how long are you going for?
Um, I don't really know.
How long are you gonna be like this for?
- Don't be a little b - Bye!
When I'm this state!
Now, it's fruit wine, which is exciting in itself.
But the thing we're most proud of is that our fruit is 100% insecticide free.
- Ah!
- Mm!
Mm!
Mm.
There's something in mine.
Oh, that's a ladybug.
That's one of the good ones.
Excuse me.
Herb Ertlinger No, this tastes like something one should not put in their mouth.
It's fruit wine.
Whoever heard of fruit wine?
Doesn't matter, it's a business.
I'll make it work.
It's next to a landfill, John.
He said former landfill.
Sorry.
I was looking into a new sprayer.
And I brought you this It's our Cabernet Merlot petit grenache.
Oh!
Sounds delightfully busy.
You know, uh, Herb, if you need any help with distribution, I have extensive contacts in that area, or if it's operations management Johnny, while I appreciate that offer, it's actually not your help I'm looking for.
- Oh.
- No.
It's you, Moira.
We were hoping that you will be the spokesperson for Herb Ertlinger fruit wines.
I-I don't understand.
My wife and I were such big fans of "Sunrise Bay".
And we would be an honoured to have you do just a few commercials to promote our wine.
That is, of course, if you like it.
Like it?
It's fruit wine.
What's not to like?
So, an hour ago, I thought I was having a heart attack.
- Oh no!
- Yup, yup.
Yup.
- Um, but I'm not.
- Oh, phew!
According to Web MD, I'm having a pulmonary embolism, which is much, much worse.
Well, you look good.
That's just the way I look.
I need you to take me to a hospital right now.
Yeah, the only hospital's in Elmdale.
You're telling me there's no doctor around here?
People just drop dead in the streets out of sheer neglect?
Well, there is, technically, a doctor.
Then, please take me to that doctor right now.
I'm just not sleeping.
I think there's a lack of oxygen getting to my heart because I'm feeling very suffocated.
Okay, right.
Well, if it is a heart attack we're way too far away from the nearest hospital for you to make it through the night.
- What?
- Kidding.
Take a deep breath for me.
Good.
Now, have you been around any feces in the past two days?
- I don't n - So, no.
- No.
- Okay.
Well, the good thing is, I don't think that you need an ambulance, David, because what I think is happening here is you're having a panic attack.
Oh no, those Those aren't real.
Those are a PR spin for celebrity publicists.
Trust me, I've known enough celebrities.
No, it's absolutely a A real thing.
Uh, tell me, have you had any experiences lately that have caused you Stress or anxiety?
Uh, well, I went from living in a 25 hundred square foot Soho live/workspace to a motel room with my sister.
Wow.
Eek.
That'll do it.
"Hello, I'm Moira Rose for Herb-" "Oh, hi!
I'm Moira Rose for Herb Ertlinger wines inviting you to try our latest offering, a fruity cab franc we call We call Herb Ertlinger's fruity cab-" Oh, no.
No, no, no.
No good.
Uh "Smokey tannins infuse this rich blend with a plummy bouquet".
"Plummy bouquet"?
Is this guy for real?
His turns of phrase leave much to be desired, but the wine is potable.
You called it liquid stink this morning.
The whites seem less stinky.
How about this tote bag?
Two-ply toilet paper has more heft.
I'm sensing negativity, John.
Is this because he did not take you up on your offer?
Are you kidding me?
Come on!
Hey, I haven't even given that guy a second's thought since I got home.
I was doing him a favour, that's all.
I don't want him tarnishing your reputation.
I mean, have you read the literature?
Look at this.
"The maximum benefit of the peachafication process".
"Peachafication"!
Who uses a word like "peachafication"?
A moron would use that.
That moron is the first moron to offer me an acting role in a very long time.
Well, he's lucky to have you.
John, this commercial, in the right hands, could be I don't want to use the word "comeback," that's I don't wanna jinx it, but John, no one knows the business better than you do.
Oh, honey, I'm just the money behind the scenes.
Not that I don't have a few company commercials under my belt, but If you want me in your corner, I'm there.
Oh, John.
Thank you.
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you.
But seriously, how cheap ass is that bag?
Ew, ew-ew, ew, ew!
You have to open your eyes to get it in the bag!
Ugh!
Good.
Ugh!
So can I ask you a question?
Why do you always get dressed up to do this?
I mean, it doesn't seem very practical.
Naomi Campbell wore Dolce & Gabbana couture to her community service.
And just because she was picking up roadkill did not mean that she needed to look like it.
And I just always really admired her courage.
Um I didn't understand a word you just said.
Besides, it's nice to uh Change clothes every once in a while.
Something you might wanna consider doing at some point.
I change my clothes.
They're just all the same.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Oh!
Well, at least now they'll get washed.
Agghhhh!
Come on!
Run!
What?
It's actually nice in here.
Well, I'm not Valentino, but you know.
Okay, well, don't try and be funny about it.
It just happens naturally.
It's that um When a guy can pack his whole wardrobe into an overnight bag, you just don't really think that he'd be much of an interior designer.
Don't worry, they're fresh.
They're clean.
Hmm.
Ooh!
Smell that rock-beaten freshness.
What?
It's just I do beat my laundry against rocks.
You're a freak.
What uh what kind of lens are we using here?
It's uh It's a zoom lens.
Oh, zoom!
Good, good, good.
- Yup, yeah.
- Any primes?
Any primes?
Using any primes?
Nah.
Those are usually for feature films.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, it's just I What's the, uh, ring light situation?
Do you think we need an inkey?
Uh I don't know, I don't know I are we booming this Today?
- Ew!
- Shhh!
Why is it dark?
It's like a witch's house in here, David.
- Shush!
- What's going on?
I am on day two of a panic attack and I have not slept at all.
Babe, you know that panic attacks aren't real, right?
They're just things that celebrities make up to No, I know.
I thought so too, but they are real and I'm having one apparently.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, while you were having your panic attack, I somehow agreed to attend a yoga class.
That might be a good thing for me.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna go though.
That might help me relax, might help me calm down.
David, I just said I'm not gonna go.
I don't wanna have to bring this up But it's my turn to take a selfish.
- No, David, - Yes, it is.
- You selfished last time.
- No.
Dubai, 2010, I had to pick you up from that blind date that went terribly wrong.
It was a total disaster.
It's my turn, and I wanna go to a yoga class.
Fine, I will go, but I am not happy about this at all.
Okay.
Get off my bed.
Ouch, David.
Ouch, David!
- Ugh!
- Shut the curtains!
Oh, some people like to exaggerate, especially in our business.
I dunno.
A lot of people on set were saying it.
He's making people nervous.
I don't care what other's say.
That's today's mantra.
- You look awesome!
- Oh - Hey!
There she is!
- Hi!
There's my TV star.
Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi!
- Nervous?
- No, I'm good.
- Good!
Don't want you nervous!

Yes.
That's the one you and I chose together.
Oh.
It looks a little less flattering in the daylight.
Johnny!
No.
I'm just saying, if there's another outfit- - No!
There's no second choice.
- Really?
- No.
- Oh, I don't know.
- Cheese tray.
- Whoa, whoa, cubby, what's this?
Who ordered cheese?
- I I asked for cheese.

No, no, no.
Honey, I'm just trying to help.
I'm just trying to be You know, watching your back.
I know, John.
You're so good at trying.
Now, I'm gonna call you as soon as I'm done.

Bye.
- All right.
- Bye.
All right.
Have a good shoot!
- You look good.

He's gonna pull the plug on the whole thing unless, and I quote, "that Bitch gets her Ass out of the trailer".
Maybe I should get back in the car?
I'm guessing, yes.
Rolling the shoulders back and down, lengthen It's just all these feelings of displacement, you know?

I'm no good!
How did you open the door?
I threw a shoe.
This wine is aw-ful!
Give me another glass.
Well, I think maybe we've had Enough wine, sweetheart.
I, I can't feel my tongue.
But I know it's there because I'm talking.
Moira, you should hear what they're saying about you out there.

The important thing is, you've gotta get back up and you've gotta get out there.
I can't.
Can't.
You can!
Moira, remember "Sunrise Bay"?
You were drunk most of season three And half of season four.
End of season five.
I'll have to take your word for it.
Did I used to have a drinking problem?
The point is, you can do this, Moira.
You're radiant.
You're beguiling.
You're daytime television's brightest star!
All you have to do is go out there and shine.
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna Nail it.
Okay.
And on a big inhale Identify any tension you may be holding.
And on a big exhale, breathe it out.
I burnt my sausage casserole.
I'm pretty sure I'm really lonely here.
Now, with one partner on the ground, the other comes into a downward dog with hands on your partner's ankles.
In the lee of a picturesque ridge lies a small, unpretentious winery, one that pampers its fruit like its own babies.
Hi!
I'm Moira Rose, and if you love fruit wine as much as I do, then you'll appreciate the craftsmanship and quality of a local vintner who brings the musk melon goodness to his oak chardonnay, and the dazzling peach cral-bapple to his Riesling rioja.
Come taste the difference good fruit can make in your wine.
You'll remember the experience and you'll remember the name.
Herb Erfling ger.
Burt Herngeif.
Irv Herb-blinger.

{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Don't judge me for what I'm about to ask you to do.
Come inside, please.
- What're you about to - It does not matter.
It doesn't matter.
What?
That.
- That's why you called me in here?
- Yeah, look at it!
- I'm looking.
- No!
Look at it.
Uh, it looks like a bug - Yeah.
- Trapped under a glass.
I Googled that bug.
It's some sort of demonic cricket that "takes chunks out of your skin when provoked".
Chunks is the word that Google used.
You Googled a bug?
Yeah.
I have a thing about bugs with milky exoskeletons.
I have this irrational fear they are gonna crawl into my mouth and nest at night, so So, what do you want me to do, kill it?
No, I think I just need moral support while I slip a piece of paper under the glass with the bug and take the trapped bug and walk it outside.
Or we could just kill it.
No, that's not the way to go.
Oh!
Oh my God!
It's fleeing!
- Whoa, it's fast!
- It's fleeing into the bathroom.
That's why you use the cup method, because you'd keep it contained!
Now it's just all out!
Well I guess I don't even need to be here.
Well, it's h Now it's hiding somewhere in the darkness Waiting for nightfall.
I I can't I can't sleep here.
I can't sleep here.
Not with your mouth open anyway.
That's not a nice thing to say to me.
You know, sometimes I forget what life was like before I knew you.
Okay, bye-bye!
Bye.
Yup.
'Kay.
Hope you catch it!
I can hear it.
I can hear it.
What the hell?
Hey!
Where's my towel?
!
John?
Johnny?
!
Where's my towel?
!
Anyways, I asked this kid to come to the front of the class and solve this math equation and he was "pitching a tent".
- He had a boner!
- Oh.
And then I was thinking, these are young boys, these poor kids, and it can't be easy having a teacher like myself, so - Mm - What was your question again?
You know, it's been so long I can't remember.
There you are, John!
Where did my towel go?
Moira!
Nanaimo bars.
Accidentally doubled the batch and Roland's on diabetes watch, so I thought why not share the wealth?
Well, what a lovely gesture, huh, Moira?
John, I had towel and now it's disappeared!
There's a towel on the back of the door.
No, that one has dirt on it!
That's not dirt.
I used it to kill a bug.
I'm sorry.
I I guess I'm stressed.
Morning, Jocelyn!
You know, Moira, you ever need to just go somewhere to unwind and have some pampering, I know a great place in Elmdale.
Let's not and say we did.
You know, honey, a little pampering might not be a bad idea.
Could alleviate some of that weight your carrying around.
So now I'm fat and stressed?
Emotional weight.
Emotional.
John, go find a towel now, please, or I will strip out of this robe and I will air dry in the street!
Okay, well, I'm just gonna go home.
Sorry.
No, no, no.
I didn't say I didn't want them.
Thank you.
A little pampering.
Great idea.
- I think so, yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey, Twy.
Um, Twy What is in the "Meadow Harvest" smoothie?
Uh you know, it changes every day.
Just depends on my mood.
But it's all organic, earthy ingredients.
Okay, so it's like fruity or ?
Yes, it is.
Yup.
At times.
And then other times, not.
Okay!
Well, today, is it more fruity or more vegetably ?
No, I don't know.
I've gotta check in the back and see what we have.
So Meadow Harvest doesn't refer to anything in particular.
No, Meadow Harvest is exactly how it sounds.
It just changes everyday.
Mm okay.
All right.
Well, I'll just um Do that that then the Meadow Harvest thing.
- Great!
- Thank you.
Hi.
Hi.
Um, I just feel like I have to warn you, what you just ordered is gonna Run through you like Niagara Falls.
Excuse me?
Uh, she's a sweet girl but her smoothies are deadly.
Um, I usually prescribe them to my patients when they're feeling a little backed up.
That's a lot of information.
I'm I'm I'm kidding.
I'm actually not.
I've absolutely done that With her smoothies.
So are you a doctor or ?
I'm a veterinarian.
Oh!
It's basically the same thing.
- Ted.
- Um Alexis.
I know.
Without sounding too forward, I've seen you around and uh You know, I have to say, I think that you are the most beautiful girl this town's ever seen.
What?
No.
I'm sure there's like another girl somewhere.
No, I mean it.
Yeah.
Well, it's really nice of you to say.
I would love to take you out to dinner sometime.
- Oh!
- I feel good about this one.
Yeah, it's a little less fruity but a little more something.
Mm!
Mm Oh my God.
So about the bug thing.
No explanation necessary.
You've got a thing about bugs.
No, I don't have a thing about bugs.
It was one bug, and that bug was milky.
So you're a man at one with nature.
Yeah.
I could not be more at one with nature.
I do Coachella every year, so Mm.
Oh!
So you'd be Into coming with me on the annual Turkey shoot then.
That's something that should excite you.
What?
- The Turkey shoot?
- Mm.
Roland's annual thing.
We go out and we hunt turkeys.
Been doing it every year since I was far too young to be holding a gun.
Yeah yes.
Yeah.
Let's do that.
I was joking.
I have a strong feeling that would not be your thing.
And what do think "my thing" is exactly?
High thread count sheets?
Colognes that smell like fireplace Okay.
Well, it might surprise you to know that I have more than one thing, so I will happily go with you on the hunt!
Nothing would make me more excited than to Go hunting for - Turkeys.
- Turkeys with you, So is this a tweed or a camo situation?
Okay, did anyone actually see this pillow come out of this container?
Seriously?
!
Go.
To.
Hell!
You're off you're a fool!
Okay, Moira, why are we doing this?
Why don't we wait for the girl to come in and help us make the bed?
She never comes, John.
No.
Bastard.
Bastard!
- Jocelyn!
Hi!
- Johnny.
Oh good, you're here, Moira.
I was just booking myself an appointment with Janine at the salon and I said to myself, "wow, Moira really looks like she needs a pick-me-up," so I booked you a Mani too!
Little girls spa day on me.
Wow!
What a nice gesture!
May I see a spa treatment menu?
Oh, well, it's just a salon, so they don't really do all that kind of stuff.
But she does give a mean scalp massage.
Really mean?
If you requested that, I guess, yeah.
Moira, this sounds too good to pass up.
Please, please do this, for me.
Let me rephrase that.
Do it for you because you deserve Yes!
My answer's yes, Jocelyn.
Thank you.
- Yay!
- Oh, yes.
So, what're you doing tonight?
Making chili.
Might do some laundry.
A polite person would now ask me what I'm doing tonight.
That's what this is about?
Sorry.
Um what're you doing tonight?
Ted's taking me out.
- Ted.
- Mm-hmm.
Ted.
I don't know his last name.
The the, um, doctor.
- The vet?
- Yeah, the doctor.
The animal doctor.
Yeah, we went to high school together.
I think you'd be good for each other.
Do you?
I think he has everything you're looking for in a husband.
A husband?
What am I looking for in a husband?
Money.
Hmm.
Did you know Richard Gere's middle name is Tiffany?
So Ted's taking me to Antonio's.
What's Antonio's?
It's this little buffet restaurant in Elmdale, but he said that we could order off the menu.
Are you sure you wanna be traveling so far out of town with a person you just met?
I went on a blind date to Bali with Leo, so I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be fine.
So who is this person?
Mm he's cute.
- And - And He doesn't have a trust fund, so, like, that's a refreshing change of pace for me.
Speaking of people without trust funds, what about that beardy thing that you spend time with?
- What?
Mutt?
- Yeah.
- No.
Ew.
It's not a thing.
- Right.
- I'm looking for Alexis.
- Oh, you have a what?
A thing with Alexis tonight?
- Uh, a date.
- I think that's Ted.
Why is he over there?
Because he knows how much I love it when mom and dad interrogate your boyfriends.
- I wonder what they're asking?
- No, David!
Tell me, Ted, are your parents still together?
Uh, no.
They divorced when I was in high school.
Oh alcoholism.
No, I think they just realized that they were better off as friends.
- Tsk, tsk.
Affair.
Poor thing.
- Hmm.
Okay.
That's enough, everybody.
Thank you so much.
Hey!
Hey!
Got the wrong room.
Hi.
- Yeah, you did.
Okay.

So Antonio's buffet, huh?
- So many choices, one little plate.
- Okay, you know what?
Bye, guys.
We'll see you in the morning!
"In the morning"!
Very funny, Alexis!
Don't even think about it.
Ain't gonna happen.
- Ted, not on the first date.
- Yes, sir.
Don't wanna kill the buzz, but have fun.
Alexis seems to have found someone to keep her busy.
What about you, David?
I'm gonna go to bed.
I have to be up early I stupidly agreed to go hunting with Stevie tomorrow.
- Hunting?
!
- Yeah.
- Hunting?

Yeah.
Wow.
- Agh!
- It's me!
- Who is it?

What're you doing lurking in our bedroom?
I'm not "lurking" in your room.
Your alarm is going off, you're not turning off your alarm!
Shoot!
You know, I'm telling you, I I I I'm not comfortable with you going hunting.
I don't feel comfortable with it either!
End.
This.
Now.
Thank you.
- All right, just be careful please!
- Okay.
Thanks.
You and your nightgown can tippy-toe back to bed.
I'm late.
You ever killed before?
Have I ever killed before?
No.
Elton John used to have an annual hunt at his place in Windsor, but that was more about the lunch.
Turkey virgin!
Does this come in a slimmer cut?
Here.
You can take this one.
It has a scope so you can see the head.
Okay!
Gather round, my shooters.
Bob has a little prayer here he'd like to offer up.
Just a little convo with the big man upstairs for a second.
It happens every year.
Our God, in these times of need, our light in these times of darkness - David, do you wanna - Oh.
So is it, like, a small town thing to end the first date with a kiss on the cheek?
What?
Nothing.
What?
!
It's not like it was a bad date or anything.
Well, it sounds like things got crazy.
Yeah!
I actually introduced him to Beyonce on the car ride on the way home, so that was very special.
It's just, if the date's a success with me, I'll let you know it.
Okay I mean, he might as well have shaken your hand.
Well, he did that too.
- Hey!
- Hey!
I thought that you could use a proper smoothie!
Well, lucky for you, we're just finishing up.
Uh, hey, Mutt.
Do you want a ride?
- I'm good.
- Are you sure?
It's a long walk.
I like walking.
Suit yourself, bud.
So you don't mind wrapping up?
Bye!
So how are your bowels?
Good and tight?
Yes.
Thank you for the concern.
Well, I just wanna make sure you got the stomach for this 'cause you, you kinda seem like an indoors-y sort of guy to me.
You know, delicate.
Fragile.
Scrimpy.
Thank you.
Okay, get down.
Have you ever held a gun before?
Uh, yeah, but it wasn't this heavy, which makes me think that Elton's was actually a toy.
All right, you gotta Treat it like it's a newborn baby.
Have to admit, not into babies so it's kind of a guessing game for me.
Oh, you got soft hands.
Okay, thank you.
Thanks.
You don't have to do this.
Do what?
Have fun?
Smell like manure?
Get called "scrimpy"?
Who wouldn't wanna sign up for this?
Yeah.
Oh, uh, Jocelyn, would you grab us a table while I speak with my husband, please.
Well, he should join us!
And between you and me, people are noticing you!
Excuse me, cowboy, have you seen my husband?
Oh my God.
Oh, oh, oh Look at you.
Boy, you look like Who?
Who do I look like?
I wanna say Tanya Harding.
Do you?
How about ?
- Jocelyn!
- Mm-hmm.
Oh my God, that's right!
Why Jocelyn?
Because everyone who comes out of that salon looks just like Jocelyn.
Wow!
And is that you?
Is that your wig?
No, it's a dead possum.
Yes, it's a wig, John.
Is she still looking at us?
Yes, she is.
Yes.
So what happened?
I can't believe you're wearing this.
This is what I get for being nice, John.
I'm doing this for Jocelyn because she paid for it, and it was her "little treat," and I didn't have the heart to rip it off my head much less torch it.
So, now, until I get in the shower, I'm stuck looking like every other inmate in this godforsaken prison.
She's coming over.
I just told a joke.
You did?
You did!
What do you think of your beautiful wife?
Well, which beautiful wife are we talking about here, huh?
Oh Well, I can't tell you how freeing it is, Jocelyn, to to try something new like this.
'Tis.
I mean, of course, as an actress, I can imagine what kind of sad character might But not necessarily.
Sad?
!
You think this is a sad look?
No!
No.
Not the look.
No, Jocelyn, I'm talking about the inner sadness that would come from From living in such a We have to get drinks.
Several drinks, don't you think?
Let's celebrate!
- Let's celebrate drinking!
- Okay.
Okay, David, it's all yours.
Aim for the face.
It's looking at me.
That's it.
You're locked in.
It's just you and him.
Okay Just point and shoot, David.
Hard to do when you're talking, Bob.
There's no one talking now.
- Bob, you're talking.
- What?
- Stop talking!
- Too much talking!
Shoot the bird, David!
Shoot it!
Ronnie honestly, if you're not gonna shoot it, I - And in the neck.
- It's still moving.
Just let it bleed out.
You okay?
I feel like one of the Manson girls.
First time's tough.
Even tougher when you shoot it in the neck 'cause then it takes longer to die.
Okay, not helping, Ronnie.
So, now what?
Do we just Wait until its Turkey family comes and shoot them too?
Hey, I think I see them.
No, no.
Yes!
Heard you.
- Jocelyn!
Hi.
- Hi.
I just wanted to say how fun it was to spend the day with you.
Oh, Jocelyn, 'tis I who owes you a big thank you.
I also wanted to apologize for Janine ruining your wig.
No, don't be silly.
I was I was about to Find a shower cap.
I know you hate your hair, Moira.
Almost as much as you hate this town.
But there's a possibility you could be here a really long time.
May I offer you something?
The people here are just trying to help you, and there'll be days when your wigs need conditioning Or one of your fashion-y blouses shrinks in the dryer, and you'll have to go to Janine's or get a shirt at the Blouse Barn, just like the rest of us.
And I would hate for that day to catch you by surprise.
I don't hate this town, Jocelyn.
It's just not mine, and this is not my hair.
I know.
It's a wig.
It's not my style.
You?
On you, it's adorable.
You have a look that says, "Hi.
I'm Jocelyn, and I know who I am"!
For that, you're very fortunate.
You are.
I don't who I am from one moment to the next.
So honestly, dear, I envy you, all right?
But if you ever Ever catch me shopping at the Blouse Barn, you must shoot me in the temple.
Promise?
Promise.
My son is hunting right now with your husband, so I I know you people have guns.
What about what we just did makes you think, "yeah, you know what?
I wanna do this year after year after year"?
Was it the lying in the mud part or was it Wearing the clothes That smell like menthol cigarettes and body odor?
'cause usually it's more fun.
Usually Ray comes and gets wasted and Spends the whole day singing Carole King ballads.
David, I Need a towel, please.
Is that a new wig?
Because You are reminding me of someone.
Towel, please.
I need my towels.
Uh, what who did this to you?
!
You went to Janine's.
Yes.
Jocelyn took me to Jocelyn!
You look like Jocelyn!
Jocelyn.

Thinking of you!
"Dear M., hope this helps, I only wish I could do more, xoxo, J.S.P." Justine St. Pierre!
David, one of my dear friends is finally reaching out, and you know what, I knew it would be Justine.
She can be an angry drunk, but we were always close.
"Congratulations on your Allez Vous Starter Kit".
That frigid whore!
What's Allez Vous?
It's a scam, it's her stupid cosmetics company!
It's a pyramid scheme for desperate housewives, and struggling actors!
Well, how much can we make from this?
David, it's an insult, we're sending it back!
Well, apparently you can win an Audi.
What colour?
A Champagne Audi, look at that!
As if you could ever sell enough of this crap to get a car.
Well, Kristi Stubbs and her team out of Montreal have sold enough to get the car, so don't believe everything you read, dear, please.
- Burn it!
- Except this mascara.
So Ray can't lend me his car today, because he has to drive his 92-year-old mother somewhere.
Where does a 92-year-old woman need to go?
!
I don't know, John, perhaps the hospital?
Yeah, well, it's just I needed that car to get to my appointment today.
What appointment?
Well, you know, the uh Thing that I had, I had a thing that I What thing?
An unemployment thing, okay?
To get unemployment insurance, I have the meeting this afternoon, and now I have to grovel to Roland, to get his truck, in order to get to Elmdale, to get this money Well, I think you're brave, and while I didn't see us living off of food stamps, I think there is something very masculine about the way you're taking control of this situation.
Sweetheart, I'm about to beg for a truck, in order to beg for money, I think you've gotta raise that masculinity bar just just a little.
- Roland!
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hi!
- What?
- Hi!
- Can't hear you.
Hey, turn the motor off!
I can't hear you, the motor's on!
Turn the motor off!
Turn the motor off, you dumb son of a well, what can I do for you, you "dumb son of a "?
Hey Roland, I need I need to borrow your truck, I've got a very important appointment today, and I sure could use it.
Well of course, Johnny, you know my truck is your truck, any time you wanna borrow it, it's fine with me, no problem- well, that's very, very nice, that's so nice.
Listen, as the owner of the truck, would you do me one favour, though?
When you return it, can you bring the seats back up, the way I had 'em, I'd appreciate that.
- I do.
- Well, you don't.
But if could, I'd appreciate it, that'd be great.
Well, I think I do!
- Here's the keys, - Thank you.
and also, when you return it, if you don't mind just backing it in, because in the morning, I have to kinda crick Yeah, I'll back it in, I'll back it in!
My neck like that, if you could back it in that would be terrific.
Sure, I'll back it in.
The wiper fluid, um I had to replace sooner than usual, - Now, I'm not asking - I don't touch the wiper fluid!
- Well, okay, somebody did.
- I never use it.
Yeah well, I guess your "imaginary friend" uses wiper fluid, right?
I don't know!
I'm not asking for payback here, but whatever you think is fair would be terrific.
Okay, I never use it, though.
The radio was at a four.
I like it at a ten, so Okay, you know what, I'm gonna walk!
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna walk, Roland!
- What do you mean you're walking?
- I don't want your truck!
No, no, the truck's right there, what are you talking I don't need your truck!
It's gonna be there all day!
I'm just asking, maybe you could put a little air in the tires, from time to time.
Bonjour!
Now that you've opened your Allez Vous starter kit, let's begin with those essential tips and tricks you'll need to make up to 600,000 dollars a year.
That's 50,000 a month, that's 7,000 dollars a week.
No, it isn't!
She didn't finish high school.
Now, you've heard of other get rich quick schemes, but this isn't a scheme, it's a system.
Look at the work she's had done, it's grotesque.
Go grab a pen and paper, because I'm about to share with you some essential tips and tricks to maximize your sales productivity.
If this seems like a dream come true, you need to pay attention to my tips and tricks.
But the best part is, the products sell themselves!
Okay, where are the tips and tricks?
We've been watching this for five minutes, she's talking in circles!
Because it's a scam!
But if your father's willing to go out there and sell his soul, dear, the least we can do is try to sell this garbage.
What's this?
Huh?
Oh, it's a sunless bronzing.
Okay, let's sell it, how hard could it be?
You sell you.
You sell you using Allez Vous.
Okay, we're going to have a luncheon.
A luncheon?
Mm-hmm, a luncheon for our little townie friends.
It's the least we could do.
Hmm!
System, support, tips, tricks, community, opportunity, tips Twyla?
- Hey, what's up?
- Nothing.
So um, Ted ordered toast, not home fries, and he got home fries, so would you just be a peach, and Oh, sorry.
No, you know what?
It's okay.
I'm good with it.
I like home fries, I'm gonna eat 'em, so.
First day of a cleanse, so she's a little whoo!
Okay, so I can take it back.
- That would actually be great, if you wouldn't - No, no thank you.
Lex, if you'll just let me eat my breakfast here, it's not like there's broken glass in it.
There's broken glass?
No, there is not broken glass in it, just a lot of great flavours that I can't wait to taste.
Great!
Thank you.
I'm just trying to help you.
Well, if you wanna help, eat something.
I do not like what this cleanse is doing to your brain.
You're being very rude!
I'm sorry for yelling.
Ain't she a beaut?
Boy, is she ever, Bob.
You know, I uh I woke up this morning, I said to myself, Johnny, you've gotta buy yourself a car.
You may have a business meeting in Elmdale one day, and you're gonna be in trouble.
Yeah, I wouldn't have thought this was your cup of tea.
Oh, this is exactly what I was looking for!
Yeah, I'd love to take this baby out for a test drive.
Yeah?
I've got the keys, let's take 'er for a spin.
Not with you, Bob, I don't wanna bother you.
It's no bother.
I would just love to take this out myself, Bob, you know, a little peccadillo of mine when I'm buying a car, I like to experience the car one on one, just me and the machine, you know what I mean?
No, I don't.
I just wanna take it out for a test drive, Bob, just for a spin.
So Once around the block?
Oh yeah, once around the block, you know, maybe around the corner, up the road a bit.
What road?
Well, this road, I'll take it up this road.
Okay, but no lefts, okay?
Because they lead to the highway, and I really don't want her on the highway.
Why would I take it on the highway?
driving down that highway of life feelin' fine and feelin' sunny going to pick me up some money You do know that just staring at the fence isn't gonna help me fix it, right?
Yeah, I am.
I'm just thinking about Ted, and how nice he is, and generous, like, almost too generous.
And I just wanna grab him by the sweater sometime, and be like, "stop being so generous and nice"!
He always has been.
I feel bad thinking about all those times I pinned him against a locker.
You pinned somebody against a locker?
!
Well, I was a different person then, a lot changed since after high school.
So what did he do to make you such a teenage clichÃ©?
He always said hi when he passed me in the halls, and for some reason, it bugged me.
Yeah, I can see that.
So he's bugging you.
What?
No!
Oh my God, no!
Oh yes.
No, I'm just saying, generally speaking, when you order breakfast and they give you the wrong order, send it back and get the right order.
I never return food, I think that's so rude.
Oh no!
Oh, son of a bum!
Son of a bitch!
Argh!
What the hell?
!
Ugh!
Oh!
Oh!
Well, the good news is all you need is a new fan belt, and then you'll be right back on the road.
Good, good.
Well, it was important I get to Elmdale today, Roland, I appreciate you helping me out.
Ah, it's no problem, Johnny.
So, where in Elmdale am I taking you?
Oh, just the general downtown area will be fine.
Okay, don't wanna tell me where we're going, interesting.
It's uh, just just a business meeting, just I've gotta meet a guy.
Uh huh, what guy?
A financial guy, it's a financial matter.
Well Johnny, it's gonna be awfully hard for me to get you to this meeting if I don't know where we're going!
I mean, why is this such a big secret?
It's not a big secret, it's not a big secret, Roland, and you're only doing 25, if we could pick it up a little Oh my God, now you're in such a hurry.
What's the big rush here?
I don't get that, either!
The office closes at four o'clock, that's all.
What office are you talking about?
The financial guy that I'm seeing, his office What financial guy?
The guy I'm doing business with, I told you - Where are we going?
!
- The unemployment office!
Okay?
I'm applying for unemployment.
Jeez pal, your business is your business.
I don't know why you're telling me!
Well, good afternoon!
Everyone have a full glass, I hope?
We've wanted to have you all here for ages, you've all so graciously welcomed us into your heavenly hamlet!
Now, if you'll be so good as to follow me, David is setting out some hors d'oeuvres in our adjoining suite.
David!
We have guests!
You were supposed to have cleaned up all these quality products!
I must've lost track of time.
Now the seating areas are covered in Allez Vous cosmetics!
I know, I just didn't want to put such high quality paraben and paba free product on the floor!
Come on in.
Okay, well everything's going super well, I can see, so well no, come on, we've gotta stay for a bit.
No, we've made our appearance, and now we can go.
Your mom asked me to come.
Well, she asked everybody to come.
Can you not just say no for one time, Ted?
!
Jocelyn, you can hold this lip plumper.
Ronnie, this is a mineral moisturizer, you could keep it on your lap, or sample it.
David, now is not the time to discuss Allez Vous' preferred customer discounts.
Oh!
Actually, I think I'm going to be getting lunch elsewhere.
Can I come with you?
I don't think so.
Now you get all decisive-y?
I was just so excited about Allez Vous' exclusive anti-aging formula, and rejuvenation serums.
Alexis, you'd like this product.
It's all about aging, and dry skin.
Oh my God, ew, David!
David, I know you're excited to be part of the fastest growing multilevel marketing community on the continent, but honestly!
There's something wrong with your face.
With my face?
Well, if any of you do happen to have questions about the products, or how to make up to 600,000 dollars a year, I suppose I'd be willing to share with you what I know.
In the meantime, please, eat, drink, to your possible beauty!
How can I help you today, sir?
Uh, yes, Johnny Rose, I have an appointment to get some money.
Get some money?
I need a cheque, preferably today.
Ideally in the next few minutes, 'cause I have somebody waiting in the car.
Well, we don't just give out money.
First we need some information.
Oh yeah, sure, yeah.
Hm-hm.
- Your name?
- Johnny Rose.
- Last employer?
- Johnny Rose.
And how long did you work for yourself?
All my life.
And your reason for being out of work?
I sold my business, and I got screwed by my business manager.
Did you pay into unemployment insurance?
I don't know, maybe I did, maybe I didn't, it never came across my desk, I uh We can't give you money unless you contributed to the program.
I don't think you're understanding, I employed people, hundreds of people.
You see, and now I'm unemployed.
But that doesn't mean you qualify for unemployment.
I lost my job!
You lost your business.
Okay, let me walk you through this.
You see, I need money to get back on my feet so I can employ more people, that might actually end up saving you money in the long run now, am I the only one who understands how an economy works around here?
!
Let me walk you through this, Mr. Rose.
Unless you can prove that you contributed, you don't qualify.
If you were laid off, or fired, or could show that you were out looking for work, that would be a different story.
I'd like to talk to your supervisor, please.
I am the supervisor.
And, may I say, doing a fantastic job.
And who's interested?
Well, it doesn't look like anybody's really interested.
Get out!
I know someone here wants in on this exclusive opportunity!
Moira, honey, that Champagne Audi is really hard to get.
Excuse me?
Take it from me, Roland and I have been Allez Vous reps for two years, and we're still driving that old truck.
Sorry, you're you're an Allez Vous consultant?
I'm actually an executive area manager.
I'm a district manager.
I'm an executive district manager.
I gave up.
What?
!
The Allez Vous craze hit the town a couple years ago, and you should've seen us!
In two weeks we had sold everything to the other half of town, and vice versa.
That's that's funny.
It became a bit incestuous, yeah, very small sales pool.
It became literally impossible to climb the ladder.
Anywho, good luck!
Somehow, we got off on the wrong foot.
Okay?
So if I in any way gave you the impression that- I am locking up now, Mr. Rose.
Johnny, how long is this gonna take, 'cause I got a couple- Roland?
Well Marnie, hello.
How are you?
Haven't seen you in a while.
Yeah, it has been a while, hasn't it?
Marnie and I were, um, how shall I say it?
"Close friends" in high school.
Isn't that right, Marnie?
Okay, that's enough of that.
Marnie likes the bad boys.
Roland!
Are you taking care of my bad boy over there?
No, she's being quite obstinate about this whole situation.
I'm getting nothing!
Well, unfortunately, Mr. Rose doesn't qualify for unemployment because he's never had a job.
Oh well, didn't he tell you about the job - he was doing for me?
- No, what job?
You didn't tell her?
No-no, not specifically, I-I-uh Well, that's important information, Mr. Rose.
You working for Roland makes you an employee.
- Yes!
- Oh!
I forgot.
Well, what were your duties?
Well, I was in more of a consulting position.
Oh!
No, no, no, no, no.
It was not a consulting position, he was my assistant, he was like my little guy Friday.
He would fetch things for me, I'd tell him where to go and he'd go running off, and fetching things for me.
What were some of the things you fetched?
- You fetched like uh - Coffee.
- Coffee, you'd get that, and um - I get his coffee - Sometimes you'd have to - Get a hankie.
- No, you'd pick up, you know - Cleaning, his dry cleaning.
- Yeah, you'd have to do that, and then - Just when he didn't have time.
How about these guys down there, those are boots.
Nothing with the boots, I don't think there was- Oh, there was something with the boots.
Polish them every once in a while.
Every now and then, he had to do that, too.
He was a hell of a worker and I really, really needed him, because you know how busy I can get.
Yes I do.
Yeah, unfortunately I had to can his ass though, because of that whole "cut the gravy" thing, so.
Oh.
Well I think we can make this work.
Hey I come in peace.
What's this?
I don't know, it's a pre shave follicle mask or something, I took it from the pile of product that nobody bought.
Sweet gesture.
I'm sorry for being rude.
You have to understand that you're the first nice guy that I've dated.
Lex, I am not always nice.
I just really want my family to like you.
They don't like me?
No, they do!
They do, they've just always seen nice as a sign of weakness, they take advantage of nice.
No, nice does not always mean weak, it's Okay, so get mad, then.
Say something super mean.
What, I can't just turn it on in an instant, like you can.
Okay well, consider it a kind of role play then, and just let it out.
I-I don't know I find your brother can be a little pretentious sometimes.
Yes, yes!
He is so pretentious, and it is so gross.
This is good, keep going.
Well, and your mother Seems to be a little uninformed at times.
She's uninformed most of the time.
This is great, this is really good.
Keep going!
Well, and you, what about you?
Are you just going to sit around all day, while I work and buy you dinners?
You've gotta go out there and get a job - Too far.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's too far, okay.
- That's too far.
All right, and there we go.
- Boy, thank you!
- Oh, stop it.
No, no, Roland, I-I owe you big.
Well um, one day, and that day may never come, I may call upon you to perform a function.
Marlon Brando!
Yes, but from what movie?
The Godfather.
No, it's the one where he's the big mafia guy.
The Godfather!
Hold on a second, I'll think of it.
Anyway, I appreciate what you've done, Roland, I really do, I'm- Don't you worry about it, Johnny, I'm happy to do it.
Why don't you just get me a little wiper fluid, and we'll call it even, okay?
Okay, wiper fluid, you got it.
And also maybe a Kleenex caddy?
I've always wanted one of those.
That's funny!
It is, but I'm not joking.
All right, one Kleenex caddy, and wiper fluid.
Roland, you screwed it up!
Roland!
Roland!
Son of a bitch!
Oh Johnny, I told you not to take 'er on the highway.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Bob, I guess I took one of those left turns, and uh, yeah.
Okay, well, let's get 'er hooked up, get you back to the garage, and we'll start on the paperwork.
What paperwork?
It's all filled in, you just have to sign it, and uh She's all yours!
I'm not buying this car!
You change your mind?
It broke, twice!
It's a broken car!
We'll play a little hardball, okay.
I'll knock twenty bucks off.
You couldn't get twenty bucks for scrap!
Oh!
All right, thirty bucks!
How about zero bucks?
!
I wouldn't give you a dime for this!
Johnny, you're killing me here!
Fifty bucks!
Oh, you know what, Bob, I'm walking.
I'm walking!
I'll throw in a couple of floor mats, but that's my final offer!
Walking!
Hey!
I said bring the goddamn diaper bag!
Have you seen that couple that checked in?
They're my cousins.
Oh.
John, you're speaking at the funeral?
Nothing says we'll miss you like an excerpt from Breaking Dawn.

Well, understandably, Bob is uh Pretty broken up by all of this and he asked me to ask you if you'd be willing to um be a pallbearer at Carl's funeral.
A pallbearer Mm-hmm.

Well, Denim has needed a diaper change since before we left the house!

You're just gonna leave me here with these people?
!
Yeah.
Like I don't feel good about it.
Um, hello!
Hello!
Is anybody in that hollow chest?
Hey, Bob.
How are you holding up?
Oh you know.
Not bad.
You know, they say death is just life except you're not here.
You're somewhere else, you know?

Yeah, he was a good man.
A good man.
He admired you, Johnny.
And I him.
Yeah.

Listen, uh, I understand about your back Yeah And I was just uh..
Just wondering if, uh, maybe you could say a few words at the funeral?
Well, the thing, uh, the thing is, uh, Bob, I-I-I don't feel I deserve that honor.
Oh, see, I'm uh I'm no good at these things.
You know, you, you're You're polished.
You know, you're You're well-spoken.
Oh no.
No, no.
Not really.
Not really.
I mean, I'm good one on one, but not-not good in a public situation.
I clam up pret-pretty good.
As a favor, Johnny.
He must have had a few close friends, - somebody that - No one.
Well, sure.
Sure.
I can say a few words, Bob.
I'll say a few words.
Have you seen the couple that checked in?
They're like really scummy.
Like very skaggy people, who happened to produce a child that hasn't been taken away from them yet.
Imagine being related to them.
No, I can't.
It's too early.
- They're my cousins.
- Oh!
Well, the um The baby's relatively normal looking.
No, no they're definitely skaggy.
My God, they're so skaggy.
Hmm.
Wait, so you're related to Carl?
Not genetically.
My mom's sister was married to Carl.
Carl is Sean's step-dad.
And was that a factor in the cause of death?
I wouldn't be surprised.
They broke up just before Sean got Bree pregnant.
Or someone got Bree pregnant.
I mean, Bree's not exactly fussy when it comes to introducing men to her vagina.
Mm.
Charming.
Tell me it's not always this clean in here.
No, it's-it's always this clean.
Oh it smells so fresh!
Uh that's the Febreeze.
I was I was eating Indian last night, so So much better than the motel.
At least you know what the smell is.
Oh, ho-oh!
Oh Hey, come on now, you two, Oh, hi!
Hi.
- Come on.
- Hi there.
Ooh!
Oh-ho-ho there's a good girl.
There's a good girl!

Isn't that right, Fifey?
Yeah, your worms are almost all gone, aren't they?
Yeah Is that a diaper on that little cutie?
Yup.
Oh!
You know what though?
Whoa -'kay.
This is just This is because she's She's She's scared right now.
But don't worry.
I can tell that you are gonna win them over.
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.
I just-I haven't um been I haven't-I don't- I'm not around dogs a lot, so No, you know what?
Don't even worry about.
Just for tonight, think of them as our kids.
Right?
Oh yeah John, you're speaking at the funeral?
The man was weeping.
What was I supposed to do?
You take his hands in yours, you look him in the eye, and say, "no".
What do you say about guy you couldn't care less about?
Oh, it's Gord what's-his-name's funeral all over again.
- Who's Gord what's-his-name?
- Exactly.
He was some kind of crew-person on Sunrise Bay.
I made an obligatory appearance at the service and his hysterical girlfriend cornered me into saying a few words.
I didn't have a thought in my head, so I just stood up and sang "Danny Boy".
Not a dry eye in the house.
Huh God, I love this bed.
I'm so glad you're not my brother.
Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty glad about that too.
But let me assure you, tonight it is just you and me.
Um Hey, the little guy is looking at us.
Oh, yeah, dogs sometimes do that.
Um maybe we could invite it to go?
Go away.
Oh, she's fine.
She's fine.
She's fine.
Oh, now you want in on the action, too, huh?
Okay, the the big one is sniffing the diaper.
Does does that mean it's full?
- Okay.

Hello.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

- Hello, Bob.
Moira, so good of you to come.
John said we had no choice.
Listen, we have some good seats down front.
Oh, that's very nice.
Boy, what a beautiful day for a funeral.
Bob in case I wanna mention this in my remarks, how-how did Carl go?
Well, it was a bit of a freak accident, really.
Apparently, he was trying to unhook his belt from the ceiling fan and apparently it It got knotted around his neck.
What?
Yeah, you know, you'd think the whole thing would've come down, you know, keeping a fan and a body spinning up there for two days.
But uh Carl found the studs on that one.
Oh Yeah That's craftsmanship.
Oh, yeah.
But that uh That was Carl.
Do you even know what that stain is or ?
Uh I'm worried if I did, I wouldn't clean it up.
Why are you cleaning it up?
Sadly, um, I threw most of the broken glass you see here.
You were a bit of a mess last night.
They told you?
Oh, no, no.
We had a full-blown conversation.
You were barely clinging to consciousness.
Oh.
Sorry.
Did I try and make out with you?
- Mm-mm.
- Good.
But now I'm worried I made out with someone else.
Uh, it's kind of my go-to when I'm a little boozy.
Mm.
Mine's shame eating, so yours sounds more fun.
Huh.
Um Is this your thong or ?
Yeah, no.
Bree's a real classy girl.
Uh, his was wrapped around the remote.
Don't worry, I threw out the remote.
Hmm.
Well, it looks like they have a side hustle.
Uh, I'm pretty sure she strips.
Why?
Oh no, this is just a lot of um - Yes, it is.
- Marijuana.
And if you're offering, my answer is yes.
Thank you for that, Shannon.
Nothing says we'll miss you like an excerpt from "Breaking Dawn," one of Carl's favourites of the Twilight movies.
Now, to say a few words, I'd like to bring up a close friend and one of Carl's personal heroes Johnny Rose.
Thank you minister.
Carl What to say about Carl ?
Once so full of life and now lying very, very close to me.
What a terrible thing death is And yet, for Carl, pretty much an all-consuming thing at this point.
He-he was a- he was a man who loved A good sweater I'm told.
And-and he loved the feel of big tool in his hand, am I right, Bob?
And I wonder, when Carl was spinning around on that ceiling fan that he was so very proud of, was he ever thinking of this town where he was born where he lived, and where he died Where he died.
But I-I-I'm not up here today to speak about dying in Schitt's Creek.
I'm-I'm here-I'm- Where the hell are you, Sean?
!
At a bar?
!
If anyone should be in a bar right now, it's me.
Sean!
Excuse me.
Well I-I am here to talk about dying in Schitt's Creek!
I'm here to talk about the misery of our lives here and how we might never escape this place, and how we do not wanna end up in a coffin, like Carl, here in this godforsaken- Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling From Glen to Glen And down the Mountain side but God So I'm sorry if, earlier, I wasn't sensitive to your animal issues.
And if it's any consolation, the dogs told me to tell you that they're super embarrassed about their behaviour, too.
Well, I am dating a vet.
I should've known that There'd be slutty little animals running around.
And I only take in the slutty ones, so I just I didn't know what to do because I love the dogs so much, but You know, I also really love The way that our relationship is going right now so much.
Mm such a sweet face.
So, to get you more comfortable around animals Not a puppy, Ted!
I No, that would be cruel to the puppy.
No, I got you this.
"Opening your heart to animals: A guide to the benefits of caring for something other than yourself".
It's a very specific book.
You might wanna check out page 37.

Good idea.
Moira!
Your "Danny Boy" What a voice.
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.
I-I'd really like you to sing at my cousin's funeral.
She's not dead, but She's been coughing a lot lately.

Mm-hmm.
Stevie?
Oh, Stevie!

Are you in danger?
Blink if you're in danger.
Stevie!
That's really not necessary.
Okay well, I'm going back to my room now And I'm gonna call the police!

Well no, but I heard through the wall, 'cause he was doing his high pitched voice.
So, was it cute for you, or what?
It was fine, it was weird, it was weird, it was good.
- Love that.
- It was good but weird.
I love that!
Um, okay, so I have to tell you this, um, Ted wants to meet my friends, So I think it's getting kinda serious.
- It's been two weeks.
- I know.
What's your point, David?
!
Ugh!
So anyway, We're throwing a party at his place tonight, so I would say be there around like, seven.
That's presumptuous, what if I have plans?
That's so cute, bring Stevie!
No, I'm not bringing Stevie, it's not a good time, - I'm gonna let the dust settle on that - Well okay, but Ted's already getting groceries, and I may I already invited her.
So it's gonna be fun!
David, it's gonna be so much fun!
Children, children!
Your father and I have something to discuss.
I'm really busy right now, though.
I can't right now, I don't have time.
We understand you have found some local friends - with whom to spend "time" with - Oh my God!
Okay, I can't deal with this right now- And that's fine.
But we do have to be careful with our hearts and our parts.
Because a podunk baby out of wedlock is not something your father and I can afford to negotiate at this moment.
Well, that's crazy, because all I want to negotiate right now is some podunk baby out of wedlock!
So- Okay, hi.
Hi!
I don't wanna sound negative about this at all, but I think that you two really actually need to consider the idea of um Getting a life.
Alexis, I would not concern yourself with your mother and me, because we have a flourishing social life here.
Walking over to the cafe and ordering a tuna melt is hardly what I would call a flourishing social life.
Oh, that's funny.
That's funny.
Yeah, it's just that you're so involved in our lives right now, and that was fine when we were child actors for a little bit, but now David and I are grown up adults, and we're just feeling very like, um - Suffocated.
- Suffocated.
- Suffocated?
!
- Wait, stop, stop!
We came in here to speak about you two!
What could you possibly have to say now?
Well, now I don't remember.
Yeah, I don't remember.
Oh my God!
Thanks.
You know, the more I think about it, the more I wonder whether David's whole "Sexually adventurous" thing was just a phase.
It's not a phase.
Well, you know, he was very influenced in college, - all those haircuts.
- It's not a phase, John!
The kids are right, we've been talking about them far more than I care to do.
Something about that top that just knocks me out, baby!
Hey, how you doing?
Ah, okay - Jocelyn, hi!
- Hi, Moira.
Why don't you join us?
Moira, what're you doing?
Attempting to be social, support me.
- Won't you, please?
- Hey, sure!
Hi!
Of course.
- Hello!
- Well!
- Hello.
- Hello.
Good to see you!
Look at us, all being together!
- Yes - Jonathan and I were just saying, wouldn't it be fun to have the mayor and his wife over for cocktails and charades tonight!
Yes Tonight.
Oh, yeah, no, unfortunately that's not gonna work for us.
We're having a huge party tonight at our place.
Ton of people coming to our house.
Whoo!
Oh yeah, big!
But we're free any other night, other than tonight.
- Hey.
- So, um So the other so, last night um - That was just a - Was a one time thing.
- That was a one time - Like a blip.
Just a blip Just a blip blop.
Just a My sister said that she uh - Invited me to Ted's, yeah.
- Yes, she'd asked you to Ted's.
- Yeah.
- Yep, um Okay, well I'm gonna leave from here, should I just come by your place, and get you when I'm done?
Yeah, we can go together, 'cause that's That's like, a totally normal thing for us to do.
- Why would it not be?
- No, it's not!
I mean So um - So, cool!
- Yeah, no, this is a good thing.
So I'll just um I'll see you when you swing by, so Yeah, I'll be- okay, all right, blippity blop.
Blippity blip.
You're quiet today.
Am I?
It's just that you're not talking, and it's annoying, because I'm bored.
Can't we just think and work, or do we always have to talk?
Okay, you're being super sketchy and emo right now, what is going on?
Have you ever been in a relationship - where you find yourself cheating - Yes!
With someone in your dreams?
Oh, what?
Oh.
Um you know that if it's in your dreams, or over the clothes, it's not cheating, right?
Yeah well, it's been happening a lot lately, and then I look over and I see Twyla, and I feel bad.
Also, Ted is throwing a party tonight, maybe that's something exciting for you two to do together?
That's probably not such a good idea.
Mmm Oh.
Oh!
Oh.
I'm sorry, what kind of event are you hosting this evening?
Event!
Oh, it's more of a soiree.
He's just teasing, it's our annual Hawaiian night.
Pineapples, pig on the spit, the whole nine yards.
Oh, you roast pigs?
- We do!
- Sure do.
We have a big one hanging in the garage.
Hm-hm.
Wow, it sounds like um quite the evening.
So whose pig do we have to slaughter to get an invite?
Oh my goodness, well, um We just didn't think that you and Johnny would wanna come, so Well, that's a touch presumptuous Jocelyn, why would we not want to be involved in a themed party in your yard?
Right.
Well, I mean, for one thing, you know, the two of you are a little A little what?
Hoity-toity.
All right, I've said it.
We didn't think that you'd wanna hang out with "regular people".
What?
Regular people?
!
Regular people are how Rose Video became such a- Right, c-careful, Moira.
Regular people!
I mean, they made us who we were- What am I trying to say?
We love regular people.
W-we love regular people.
Well, by all means then, the two of you are invited.
Thank you!
So, just to be clear, um, I'm a red wine drinker.
- That's fine.
- Okay, cool.
But uh, I only drink red wine.
Okay.
And up until last night I was under the impression that you too only drank red wine.
But I guess I was wrong?
I see where you're going with this.
Um I do drink red wine.
But I also drink white wine.
- Oh.
- And I've been known to sample the occasional Rose.
And a couple summers back I tried a Merlot, that used to be a chardonnay.
- Uh-okay.
- Which got a bit complicated.
Yeah, so, you're just really open to all wines.
I like the wine, and not the label.
Does that make sense?
- Yes, that does.
- Okay.
Um, this is just very new to me, so as long as you didn't roll over, and cry yourself to sleep with regret, then we're good, right?
No, no, no, I absolutely did that.
Just wept for hours in the dark.
I say we go with this one, it's the biggest.
Wow Ted, the place is very New looking.
Did you design the interior?
Oh, I wish!
No, I found this website online that sells off old department store show rooms.
So this whole room- Just gets delivered, as is.
This is the "bachelor's den" here, and then that's the "executive dining lounge" that I got on black Friday.
- Wow!
- Yeah.
Wow.
So Are we the only ones showing up to this party?
No, we're still waiting for Mutt and Twyla.
Oh, I should take the rolls out of the microwave.
Hot rolls!
Alexis had just said that this was a "party" party.
Ah well, you must've been misinformed then, David.
No, it's a dinner party.
I wanted to get to know Alexis' friends a bit, so I figured we'd invite a few couples over, huh, have some dinner, play some games?
You guys showed!
Yeah, why wouldn't we show?
Twyla, I love your outfit, you look like a little Georgia peach!
- Hi.
- So, where is everybody?
I thought this was a party.
It is, it's an exclusive little party.
Hey, who turned off don ho?
!
- Oh hey, aloha, Roses!
- Look who it is.
It's the Schitts!
Hey!
Yeah, there you go.
- Jocelyn.
- Moira.
Ooh, Johnny!
I gotta tell you, that suit, that's pretty dangerous to wear at a party like this!
I just wanna wipe my hands all over that!
Oh!
You just keep getting funnier.
I'm not joking though, I really do.
Moira, I have to ask you, are those wigs real hair?
I just wanna reach out and just touch them- oh, please don't!
No, Maureen does not like to be manhandled!
- Sorry, sorry.
- Hey Roses, if I tell you a secret, you promise to keep it?
Uh no, I don't think we would, what is it?
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Johnny Now listen, I'm the guy in charge of upholding the law around here, so if you have any ideas about turning me in, you'd just be turning me in to myself!
Spark it up, Roley!
Spark it up.
You got it, honey.
Listen, I don't know if you guys wanna partake in this, because I'm sure your fancy dinner parties didn't have illegal substances!
Illegal substances.
Amateurs.
We had friends in the fda, but When in Rome.
Well damn, Roses!
Let this party begin.
I'll fire up the cheese fountain!
Oh!
No thank you.
So Mutt, did you two criminals do any good for the community today?
You washed a car, wow.
The judicial system is really cracking down on its delinquents these days, huh?
You know what I always wondered, what do you two talk about all day out there?
Nothing.
I mean we talk, but We don't really talk about anything important.
So Like what?
Like, nothing!
Okay, um Like, Mutt was having a bad day today, so we talked about that.
You didn't tell me you were having a bad day.
- Ted, this is delicious.
- Mm-hmm.
I didn't mean a bad day, Twy, I just meant like, he was questioning things.
Thank you, Stevie, I ordered it online from Nevada.
No sales tax.
- What were you questioning?
- It's nothing.
So when the lasagna gets delivered, does it come frozen, or ?
Okay, I just uh I don't know why you didn't feel comfortable talking to me about it.
It's not important.
That's why I was talking to Alexis about it.
Stevie, how long have you and David been um It's very fresh, and new.
- No, it's not.
- It is, I would say.
Uh uh!
So everyone knows?
- Knows what?
- These two have What an elegant gesture, Ted.
I-I'm sorry, I thought everyone knew.
- No.
- It's okay.
Sorry!
I've been with these people before.
I know them all.
Wow, you've really been getting around town.
No, I was with them in my other life.
I'm gonna tell you something.
I'm from a small town, just like this.
No, I'm not buying that!
- It's true.
- Really?
Why would you leave?
Oh God, I couldn't wait to get out.
I was dying there.
Have you never dreamed?
Of a life beyond?
You have what ifs, like, what if I had enlisted in the military, what if Roland hadn't been such a smooth talker, what- oh man, what if!
What if I had not been crowned "miss snow cone" at 16, and moved to the city with my driving instructor?
Awesome.
And what if I had not hand modeled at that microwave trade show?
Yeah.
What if I didn't ask, who's the eyebrows buying everyone's drinks?
Wow, now you know.
Whatever happened to privacy?
Now your whole family thinks I'm this big hooker!
My whole family does not think you're a big hooker!
It a funny one night thing!
Everyone here is fine with it.
It was funny?
Yeah, it was a f-it was a fun- it was a-it was a funny-it was-yes.
I had a best friend that hooked.
She married one of her Johns on my birthday.
Wow, so cool!
It's not the time, Twyla.
Um Stevie, I don't think you're a big hooker.
You don't talk all dinner, and now you're telling me I can't talk about Trixie?
!
I'm sorry, it's just I think sometimes you have a tendency to say the wrong thing, that's all.
Is there a right time to talk about being a hooker?
I bet nobody thought sex with Trixie was funny.
I never said it was bad!
Okay, you know what I think is happening, is things are just getting blown out of proportion, and honestly, if Alexis, you just tell us what you and mutt were talking about, it'd probably help.
Oh my God, Ted!
We were just washing a car, and talking about bad dreams.
- Okay?
- Okay.
You sound a little defensive.
- I'd agree.
- Well You know what, i just remembered, I have to wake up early tomorrow, I have an early check in.
Uh, nobody checks in.
Tomorrow someone is, early.
Uh Ted, you have a really special place, and we should all do this again some time.
David, would you mind walking me home, I don't think we're finished talking.
Oooh, David!
Don't!
My son lives in a barn in the woods, by choice!
He could be the next mayor of this town if he wanted it.
My son is "pansexual".
Mm-hmm, I've heard of that.
I know what that is, that's uh That cookware fetish.
- No.
- Mm-hmm!
- No, no.
- No, I read about that!
No, he loves everyone, men, women, women who become men, men who become women.
I'm his father, and I always wanted his life to be easy.
But you know, just pick one gender, and maybe, maybe everything would've been less confusing.
Well You know Johnny, when it comes to matters of the heart, we can't tell our kids who to love.
- Who said that?
- You did.
When?
- You just said it now!
- When?
Now, right this second, you just said it.
And you're right, you can't tell them.
And I'm fine with that.
Whoa, thank you for playing along.
I'm sorry, I just had to get out of there, it was like being in an episode of "couples therapy".
Okay wait, this was all a put on, just to get out of dinner?
Yeah, I thought you were in on it.
Well, you deserve a daytime Emmy for that performance.
Thank you, I think so.
Okay, so you're not like, raging mad at me, then.
No.
I think it's fair to say that neither of us have ever worked with a ceiling mirror before.
- True.
- It was funny!
And a little humiliating.
Yeah, I uh Saw a lot of my body, and I didn't like it.
- Mm-hmm.
- So I'm actually that way.
Okay, yeah, I was um- wondering if maybe we should um Try it again, for the sake of practice?
I'd be into that idea For the sake of proficiency.
So I guess we won't be playing headbandz.
- Why did you say that?
- Oh my God.
What the hell Just don't, just stay here.
Oh, hello again!
Spending another night together?
Dad!
Oh, Stevie, I hope you're being smart.
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!
Because we can't afford a baby right now, and, let's be honest, neither can you!
Okay, well, I think it's about time that you two go to bed.
Excuse me!
David, I just want you to know that I support this.
Not the fact that you're sleeping with a girl, which is great.
But you know, I'd be just as happy if you were to bring home one of your guy friends.
What are you talking about?
!
Excuse me while I just go draw a warm bath, and plug in my hair dryer.
No, no, Stevie!
You're a lovely girl, lovely girl.
Bit of an edge, but you know, it's growing on me.
David, I just want you to know that I endorse all your sexual encounters.
A-are you drunk?
!
Grass, too much grass.
- A little bit, but.
- What the ?
Hey, track that cycle, missy!
Okay, good night!
Hey, good night!
Good night.
Hey!
Come in and say hi to your aunt Dee Dee.
Better hurry before she disappears for another decade.
We should probably establish some boundaries about this whole friends with benefits thing.
Can we do that after you screw Mr. fix-it?
Or Hey!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Agghhhhhh!
me!
me!
- What?
-  me!
- What?
- John, there's something in the bed!
- What?
- Something crawled up my leg and I can't see it!
- What?
- I can't see it!
- A spider?
- No!
Something invisible like Lice, or scabies, or bed bugs!
Oh, we don't have bed bugs.
Oh, John, I can't afford to burn all my clothes!
Oh, Moira, relax.
Just relax.
If we had lice, I'd have lice!
Guess who?
Deedee?
!
- Hi, Momo.
- What the hell?
Sorry.
I know I should've called, but um I just thought it'd be really fun to come see my older sister in her new digs.
You know, a little visit.
Oh.
Um do you really have lice?
I'd hate to contract lice.
So, Deedee, you are looking well.
Seaweed facials.
I get one every week.
But enough about me, I wanna talk about you guys.
Mm.
I want you to know that I Really wanted to come and visit you when I heard about your life collapsing, but I got this really big job promotion that week and things got, you know, kinda crazy.
Plus, we haven't really seen much of each other recently.
Yes, well, we've had kind of a hectic year.
Well, thank goodness for the Internet!
Seemed to be the only thing letting me know you two were still alive.
Telephone is also amazing!
You just push the buttons and say, "Hi, it's me, your deadbeat sister".
Well, it's a treat seeing you two going at it again.
Kids!
Come in and say hi to your aunt Deedee!
Better hurry before she disappears for another decade.
Oh!
What?
Look at you guys!
You've grown!
Why did I think that you were dead?
Ah, you're so sweet.
Now how long has it been since we've seen each other?
I think you crashed one of my pool parties with some guy you were calling "Uncle Julio".
Oh!
I remember that.
All right, you guys treat yourself, okay?
Buy yourself something nice.
- A hundred dollars?
!
Oh my goodness, wow.
- Oh my God!
Oh my God, I missed you!
I missed you so much!
I missed you so much!
Oh gosh, look at that.
They are sweet kids!
I don't know what you were so worried about, Moira.
Deedee, what are you doing here?
Are you staying here at the motel?
Can I get you a room?
No.
God no.
No, I mean no, I I booked myself into a junior suite at the Comfort Inn in Elmdale, thank you.
This is very darling, it's just it doesn't have a gym and I'm kind of in the best shape of my life right now and I kinda wanna keep it that way.
Okay.
Okay, so you're saying that I would be as in shape as you are if I just fixed lights all day?
Pretty much.
Well a few pull ups here and there.
Okay, so you do workout.
You are such a liar!
Oh!
Wow!
Did Stevie say something funny or ?
- Grant, this is David Rose.
- Hi.
He's one of our permanent guests here.
Don't say that again.
Grant does repairs around here.
- Oh, great.
- He was also just trying to tell me that he got that body from just being a handyman.
Well, isn't Grant just a big fat liar!
- Um - I gotta grab the right marette, so My head is all over the place.
She keeps distracting me.
Wow.
He is wearing a tight shirt!
So is he gonna do some repairs on your on your undies?
Who's to say he hasn't already.
Wow!
Great.
Why, is that a problem for you?
No.
No.
Do you.
Do him.
Do both.
Do things.
- Great.
I think I might.
- Yeah.
Good.
Jump in.
So We should probably establish some boundaries about this whole friends with benefits thing.
Okay.
Yeah.
No, let's do that.
Let's, uh, let's put up some boundaries uh, for the infrequent benefits that our friendship has.
I think that's really good.
Can we do that after you screw mister fix-it or would you like to do it now?
Let's throw some boundaries up.
'Kay.
Hey, Twyla.
Twyla!
Twyla?
!
I'm so sorry.
I really didn't think that was gonna hit you.
That's okay.
Your mom did the same thing to me this morning.
- Okay.
- What can I get you guys?
Just coffees.
Thanks.
So what's going on over there?
I'm just working on something.
Just a little thing for Mutt.
Oh!
Is it his birthday or something?
No.
Um, my dad always said, "When in doubt, say it with a song".
He was a roadie with Fleetwood Mac and that was the last thing Mick Fleetwood said to him Before the band hit him with a restraining order.
So you're writing a song for Mutt then?
Yeah, I'm trying to.
Cute!
So what, is it about Your feelings, or is it love and what?
Are we shooting a Dateline investigative report?
No we're not.
I'm just looking out for my friend.
Um honestly, Twy, ixnay on the ongsay.
Because I tried it once and the guy ripped the guitar out of my hands and he just started smashing it on the ground.
Granted, I'm tone deaf and he was a He was a super angry marine, but Just let the girl write her boyfriend a song!
Okay, I know!
And I'm all for it, I'm all for it.
I just think it's um I think it's a super big mistake.
David!
Jocelyn.
Hi.
Can I ask you something?
Uh that depends.
How shall I put this?
You strike me as the sort of person that had a hard time in high school.
Thank you.
Your floral top, for instance.
Is there something I can help you with?
Well, there's a new kid in my school and he's having a little trouble fitting in.
Mm-hmm.
He's also struggling with his sexuality, which I think that you may be also What can I help you with, Jocelyn?
Well, I was thinking, wouldn't it be wonderful if you could come down to the school, you know, maybe talk to him and tell him that things only get better.
The idea of me life coaching another human being should scare you.
A lot.
I don't I knew there was a good person in there somewhere, David.
Oh, and honey, get the quilted; that other stuff will chafe you right up.
So this is weird.
Um, today marks the longest relationship that I've ever voluntarily had with someone.
Voluntarily.
Yeah.
The actual longest relationship was um A three month affair with a Saudi prince, but for the last two months of that I was trapped in his palace trying to get to an embassy.
Um, so hey.
How is it going with you and Twyla?
You guys are looking cute.
Uh I don't know.
Why?
What's going on?
I dunno.
It it's nothing.
It's fine.
Okay, if my boyfriend ever described our relationship as "fine," I think I would literally it's just it feels like it's run its course.
- What?
- And I think we've both known it for a while now.
Oh.
Oh, give me a break.
How did you find me?
Well, where else is there to go?
And Johnny may have told me.
Thank you, Johnny.
Moira, why are you making this so difficult for me?
Oh where do I start?
Um, you know, I think it's best we don't go there.
No, I'd like to go there.
Please, take me.
Fifty thousand dollars.
Does that sound familiar?
- Yes.
You gave that to me as a downpayment - No!
Loaned it.
You gave it to me as a down payment for my buffalonian town house.
We handed you the money and you said ?
- Thank you?
- Oh, too late.
Well, Moira, considering you had over 500 million dollars in the bank, I'm a little personally offended that I didn't get more.
Go away, Deedee.
No.
No.
Not until I do what I came here to do.
Didn't want to hurt your feelings, but I forgot.
- Don't you dare.
- You don't have feelings.
- Don't you dare.
- Yes, yes.
I am paying you back.
It's not everything, but it's a start.
So walk me through this She offered you a cheque and you turned it down?
She was insulting us!
Moira, the woman dates dive bar owners, okay?
Let her insult us!
Well, I don't know whether you've noticed, but we could use the money.
You talk about bed bugs?
That check could pay for fumigation.
Better yet, we could move to a place that doesn't have bed bugs.
I don't want her money.
I want our money.
She owes us!
We loaned her $50,000 dollars!
We gave her $50,000 dollars, and you spent more than that on wigs that year.
I don't see any one else lining up to give us cheques.
Why are you taking her side?
I'm not taking her side, but she's offering us a way out and you're letting your pride get in the way.
It's all I have left, John, literally.
Swallow it, Moira.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
And then we can buy a case of champagne to wash it down with.
So you and Grant.
How are things going?
Uh well, he asked me out for dinner tonight, so we're gonna do that.
We're gonna go for dinner, Grant and I. Yeah!
Yeah, that's Well, he seems like a really like respectable guy.
Like one of those guys that has like a Candy bowl of condoms on his bedside table or something.
Oh, hope so.
Wonder what colour I'll get.
Yeah!
So I am mentoring a teen in crisis later.
That's what I'm doing.
One of Jocelyn's students, so He's being bullied because he's different, so I'm helping to change his life.
Giving back, so - Wow - Yeah.
And on a scale of one to ten, how much are you looking forward to that?
Three point five.
I'm gonna leave you be because it's not everyday you get to go on a date with a guy who owns a windowless van, so Oh, Grant.
Hi!
What're you doing?
You checking out porn again?
I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go.
Um Warmest regards to you both.
Best wishes.
Such a weird dude.
Yes.
Yes, he is.
You must be Connor.
Yeah.
I don't know how much Mrs. Schitt has told you, but she asked me to come in and have a chat.
She thinks that since we're both new here it might be worth talking about some things like, you know, fitting in.
Apparently you're having trouble fitting in.
Who who who are who are you?
Oh, my name is David.
Are you like a doctor or something?
A psychologist?
Am I what?
N-uh, no.
So why would I talk to you?
I don't know.
Because your teacher is concerned that you're having trouble adjusting.
So she told you to come here and and what, help help me?
Look at you.
Look at your pants.
Excuse me!
I am sensing a tinge of disrespect here.
I'll tell you what my problem is.
I'm a 16-year-old gay kid living in a town that makes me wanna throw up.
The issue isn't me not fitting in.
It's me not wanting to fit in.
Is there anything else you wanna, you wanna help me with?
No.
Go ahead and order whatever you want.
This is on us.
Oh.
They're letting you run up a long tab, are they?
You see?
Well, I hear the pork is very good here.
The ribs, the chops, the roast Nothing for me, thanks.
Well, isn't that funny.
Because Moira doesn't eat here either.
But I will be eating and I just don't know whether to have the ribs or the chops, but I'm definitely ordering pork.
If you mention pork one more time Moira, um don't you have something you wanna say to your sister?
No.
Oh, I'm pretty sure you do.
I'm pretty sure I don't.
Thank you for trying, Johnny.
Truly.
But like I'm just really uncomfortable right now with my older sister acting like a stubborn child.
Okay, why don't we all take a deep breath here and try and remember what's really important, okay?
We are family, and we have to hang onto that.
And you know as well as I do, Moira, that in times of crisis, the one thing we need to hang onto is family.
Okay, okay.
Deedee We appreciate you coming to this town And offering whatever it is you're offering.
Much appreciated.
'Cause seriously, I thought you were just coming here to gloat.
No, no, no.
I came here in the spirit of giving and forgiving.
The the gloating thing was a bonus.
Moira, go on Yes, go on.
We need help.
Please help us.
Okay!
I will.
Hmm?
Oh!
I'm gonna do this for you, but mostly, I'm doing it for me.
Why?
Because you can't And I can.
Okay.
How much are we gonna make this out for?
Oh sh I haven't the foggiest.
I couldn't I couldn't come up with a number.
I mean, I whatever you think is fair.
Well, you guys gave me fifty grand, right?
Yes, we gave you fifty thousand when we had the money.
But I can't I can't ask you for fifty thousand dollars.
Whatever you think is the Equivalent amount.
Okay, I think I can do you A little better than that.
Okay?
Oh, so unnecessary, Deedee, but thank you.
Well, who's up for pork?
Okay so you're telling me your girlfriend is on a date with someone else and, instead of doing something about it, you're here talking to me, a kid who practically has no respect for you.
Well, first of all, you're a little bitchy.
Second of all, she is not my girlfriend.
She's someone I'm occasionally having sex with because we're bored and desperate.
Ah you're doing a friends with benefits thing with this girl.
Have you not seen the 42 films they've made about it?
It never works.
Okay, well, movies aren't always right, all right?
You'll learn that later in life.
I happen to be a little bit older than you are, so - Obviously.
- Okay.
Well, I think we're good here.
You're gonna be okay, right?
You're stable?
I have a party later.
Can you buy me some beer?
Uh, no.
Can you buy me some beer?
!
Hey!
Can I grab a glass of water?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.
So how's the uh song going?
Is that Is the song still a thing?
Yeah!
Do you wanna hear some of it?
Um, I would love to, but I actually hate music, so I don't think I'd be a very good judge.
- You hate music?
- Mm-hmm Are we sure that Mutt likes music?
'Cause I feel like if he didn't it could be kind of awkward.
Are you feeling okay?
Um I just don't think that The song thing is a good idea.
For, like, a lot of reasons.
Um are you sure that you wanna put yourself in such a vulnerable situation, Twy?
Are you saying you don't think Mutt would like it?
I don't know.
I mean I'm not sure.
Maybe, but I don't I'm not yeah, I'm not sure.
Did you talk to Mutt?
Because I know that We've been sort of off for a while.
And I've been just trying to think of things to make it better and so I'm you know, I'm just trying to make it work.
I think that you should talk to Mutt before Breaking into song.
Thank you, Alexis.
For what?
Bye.
In all honesty, Mutt was just a place holder.
According to my tea leaves, the guy I'm suppose to marry is black, so Oh.
- What and why are we drinking?
- Oh my goodness!
Um, I don't know, and today, some snippy teen told me that my life was a mess, so And I am now a single person.
Oh So did you spend the night washing your clothes on Grant's abs?
- You're funny.
- Mm-hmm.
Um, Grant went to the bathroom and never came back.
- Thank you.
- What?
He w he went to the bathroom and never came back?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh So either I was stood up halfway through my date or Grant has some serious digestive issues.
- Mm.
- Wow.
Sounds like a real catch.
So word on teen street is that our little Friends with benefits situation is a - Not a good idea?
- Is a bad idea.
And because I don't have any other friends here, I can't afford to lose you, so I think it's best if we just - Friends.
- Friends.
Yup.
I think that's best.
Good.
This is good.
- That's good, right?
- That's good.
Okay.
Well Warmest wishes to that.
Kindest regards.
Yeah!
Cheers!
- Whoa.
Twy - Mm - That's - It's good, right?
My eyes are tearing.
So this is it?
After all that?
And we paid for the dinner!
So we lost money on the whole deal.
I'll tell ya, she's gonna be embarrassed when this thing gets cashed.
She will be embarrassed.
She missed a zero.
Moira, she missed a zero or two.
I you know what?
I'm gonna call her.
I'm calling her right now, that What a cheap-ass amount!
Turn your light off, John.
Your sister is a cheap ass.
Cheap ass.
We're planning a surprise party for your mother.
Listen to the words coming out of your mouth.
Then you plan it.
No!
Oh, he snap-diva'd!
Talk to the hand, son, because the ears are no longer working.
Oh my God.
Okay, that's not at all how that works.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Nope.
Nope.
- Huh?
- N Nope.
Nope.
No.
No.
No.
Kids, just came in to remind you to keep Saturday open.
What's Saturday?
What's Saturday?
It's your mother's birthday.
No her birthday is the second weekend in May.
That's mother's day, honey.
- I don't think so.
- I just don't think that this is the year to be doing something big.
Oh, why?
Because we're here, in this town?
All the more reason to do something.
Um I actually agree with David.
Um plus, I'm gonna be in Chicago this weekend.
- You're what?
- Ted's taking me.
We've been planning this for a super long time, so.
Well, can I come?
- No.
- Okay, here's a newsflash for both of you.
You're not going anywhere and we're planning a surprise party for your mother.
No.
That's not That's not a good idea.
That's not a good idea?
Where would you even throw a party like that in this town?
I don't know.
I haven't thought that through yet.
Maybe Roland's house.
Listen to the words coming out of your mouth.
Then you plan it.
- What?
No!
- Oh, snap, David!
Talk to the hand, son, because the ears are no longer working.
- Oh my God.
- 'Kay, that's not at all how that works, so Cancel your trip, Alexis, because the travel agent is out of the office.
It's so uncomfortable when he does stuff like that.
- No.
Absolutely not.
- I feel so weird about it.
And on Saturday, we have the afternoon off, so I booked us a Chicago's best deep dish pizza tour.
Oh my God.
Well, that's probably gonna have to change, but what else did you book for us?
Uh, well, we're staying at the Clarendon Executive Suites and apartments downtown.
- Oh my God.
- Got upgraded.
Does that mean room service?
!
- Yeah.
- Babe!
- Hi!
- Hey.
Had an idea for mom's stupid surprise party thing.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- What if we told her that it was a fund-raiser?
- She'd have to say yes, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- 'Cause she'd have to come then, right?
- Totally, totally, yeah.
- She loves the fundraisers and - She loves them.
Wait.
When's the big party?
Oh, it's this Saturday.
Alexis, did you not tell Ted about your change of plans?
David, I told you that I couldn't come - It's this Saturday?
- To that.
Yeah.
But, David, I did tell you that I Won't be able to attend, so Well, Lex, I mean You can't miss your own mother's surprise party.
I am with I'm with Ted on this one.
But, babe, you're going to A veterinary conference in a Chicago suburb and I think that's that's really important for us.
Yeah, I know.
Here's just the thing about our mom: She'll be really devastated if Alexis doesn't come, and I'm sure you're from a really solid home and - David - Understand.
I'm gonna slap you in the face.
Um but babe, what about the um The travelling pizza tour that was so yeah, and I'm also gonna need you to ask Mutt for the barn 'cause I'm thinking of heading in that sort of aesthetic direction for the party.
Um, and I know that you guys have a close working relationship, so No.
No.
Sweetie, there will be other conferences.
I really think that you need to be here for this.
Me too.
David, you and mom literally ruin my life.
Roland!
Hey!
Johnny Rose!
How are you?
- I'm good!
- Good.
- Listen.
Need a big favour.
- Sure.
Saturday is Moira's birthday and we want to throw her a surprise party.
- Oh!
- So, we need an excuse to get her all dressed up and out of the house.
Well, dinner at our place.
Problem solved.
Well tempting, but it's gotta be something fancy and, uh, elegant.
You know, black tie.
So we're thinking maybe Jocelyn is throwing her "annual charity fundraiser".
She hasn't mentioned anything to me about it.
Why would she mention it?
Well, Johnny, uh If she's planning a fundraiser, I think Jocelyn would mention something about it to her husband.
It's not a real fundraiser, Roland.
It's just a pretend fundraiser to get Moira out of the house.
You see, I I could tell her about it myself, but she would catch on because it falls on the same night as her birthday, so she's gotta hear about the fundraiser from someone who doesn't know it's her birthday.
Okay, so then you want me to find somebody who doesn't know.
No.
I want you to tell her.
But that doesn't make any sense.
I know it's her birthday.
You only know it's her birthday because I just told you it's her birthday.
Moira doesn't know you know it's her birthday.
- Roland I won't tell her.
- Why would you tell her?
I won't tell her is what I'm saying to you.
I won't tell her, so don't worry about it.
Okay, but now I am worried.
I am worried now.
Look, I'm taking Moira out for coffees.
We're going up to the café, okay, this afternoon.
And that would be a great time for you to stop by and drop the information about the fundraiser.
Tell me you understand the plan.
Yes, Johnny, I understand the plan!
Jeez!
And I don't appreciate being talked to like a child!
Okay, I'm sorry.
Roland - Well, I'm sorry.
It's a little demeaning.
- Look, I'm sorry.
It's just so important.
This is really important.
I wanna make sure you understand the plan.
Okay!
I understand, all right?
- Okay.
- I just think it's awfully short notice to start planning a fundraiser.
There is no fundraiser!
- Right.
No fundraiser.
- It's pretend!
Pretend.
It's fun time.
So I am gonna need a lift to Elmdale.
What does it look like I'm doing?
I don't know, nothing?
I'm working.
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.
I have a job that I just can't leave to drive you to Elmdale.
Okay yeah, and I totally respect that.
It's just that I found a Ganache Torte in Elmdale and I really need to pick it up before my mom's birthday thing, so I work until six.
Okay, but like is anyone checking in this afternoon?
- It's a cake.
- It's a torte!
Um is there something going on?
You could always just hitch-hike?
And wake up chained to a pole in a trucker's basement?
- Not today.
- Well, I'm working At my job, so I can't just up and leave because you want cake.
Okay.
Well, when you put it like that, it makes me sound ridiculous Um which I'm not.
So thank you For your services this afternoon.
Hey!
Hey sorry I'm late, Johnny.
Had a little memorizing To do.
Late for late for what, Roland?
- I don't know what you mean?
- For Jocelyn's big shindig.
I'm here to personally invite the two of you to, um, a um annual, um, elegant dress-up event that Jocelyn is hosting.
Um well, no, I'm not inviting you, but I'm saying we're We'll see each other there At the very big event that Jocelyn is hosting.
The whole town will go to this event.
They'll all be dressed up and um Did I did I say that it's a fundraiser?
Oh, sorry, Johnny.
Let me start over here.
Why are you apologizing to me?
You don't have to apologize to me.
No, no.
It's a fundraiser for the thing with the Children that The-with the mouth Uh, cleft palates, and um Joc' does it every year well, uh, Roland, you know what?
We're-we're Probably just gonna be hanging around the motel on Saturday, you know.
Yeah, no, I'm sure.
It's uh Hard to look at those kids and all that, I get it.
But you know what?
We'll dress them up too.
Put us down for four tickets.
Really.
Oh yes, it's the least we can do to support Jocelyn's philanthropic endeavours.
Oh!
Okay.
Well, I'm sure Jocelyn would really appreciate it.
Well, listen, thank you, Roland, for that.
You're welcome.
I think that went well!
Okay, thank you.
Okay.
So I guess I'll see you soon then, Johnny.
Yeah bye-bye.
Yes, goodbye, Johnny.
Oh, sorry!
Ugh!
Could you be going any faster?
Well, we should put that up quick.
Um so we're planning this surprise for my mom that's totally not gonna work and I'm supposed to ask you if we can borrow your barn.
But if you can't take the night off from bedding women, I totally understand.
Well, who says I can't do both?
You had a bug in your hair.
Oh.
Ew!
- Jocelyn!
- Moira, hi!
Jocelyn, I'm so glad I've run into you.
Roland was mentioning your fundraiser earlier today and it got me thinking My what?
Your annual fundraiser for the children with troubled mouths.
Oh, right.
Yes.
It's gonna be q-quite a night.
I hope so, 'cause I'd like to be involved.
- With ?
- Your fundraiser.
As I'm sure you know, I was on the board of some of the most profitable not-profits, from San Francisco to London.
And after speaking with Roland, I realized I was remiss not to gift you with my wealth of experience.
Wow!
That's very generous of you, Moira.
I was gonna ask you, but I didn't wanna impose.
Jocelyn, you must stop being intimidated by me.
It's unnerving.
- Sorry.
- No, it's fine.
Just say thank you.
- Thank you?
- There you go!
My pleasure!
Oh,!
What do you mean, you didn't get the cake?
The only Chocolate Ganache cake I could find, was in Elmdale, and I asked Stevie to drive me but she said no because I think she's going through something right now.
Moira: David!
I don't know.
Something with her body.
David, I need you.
I was speaking to Jocelyn about this fundraiser she's apparently organizing Whoa-whoa, you-you were talking to Jocelyn?
Yes, about the fundraiser, and the poor thing looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
And I cannot stand by and watch this woman drive a perfectly worthy cause into the ground.
So, David, you and I We're gonna help her.
Okay.
I asked you to get her invited to the fundraiser, not involved in the fundraiser.
The fundraiser was your idea!
You didn't think your mother would get involved in planning a fundraiser?
My God, she had Hilary shaking last year at the Clinton foundation dinner.
God!
Roland.
Roland.
Stupid Roland.
Roland?
!
How did Roland get involved in this?
I got him involved, it was a bad mistake, okay?
But look, it'll be fine.
I will get the cake with your sister.
All you've gotta do is keep your mother under control.
The North Korean army could not keep my mother under control when it comes to event planning.
What?
Huh?
Oh!
How long was I sleeping?
I dunno, like forty-five maybe.
Oh?
Where are we?
Um, we're almost there.
The last sign I saw said "exit Elmdale," so I haven't seen it yet, but We should be getting there soon.
The last sign said "exit Elmdale"?
Mm-hmm.
Well, that was the exit to Elmdale.
We've gone too far, we've gotta turn back!
- But you were sleeping!
- Well, wake me up!
No!
Because you're so grumpy when you wake- like you're grumpy right now.
Well, Moira, in regards to the decorations, David was kind enough to offer me an incredibly long list of the things to stay away from.
Darling, one does not just stick a red nose on it and call it an event.
There is an order to these things.
Okay, here we go.
Again, what is the organization that it's for?
- The surgeons - Uh the doctors who un-cleft the mouths.
Never heard of it.
And who are the trustees?
I don't think they're gonna come.
Oh, how very churlish of them.
How much are tickets?
Um free?
We haven't figured out the ticket price yet.
I'm not paying for this thing.
Oh my God!
Do you people know what the word fundraising means?
Why don't you leave that up to us.
Jocelyn, I need your timeline and your checklist.
Your plan book.
Well, we have a plan.
It's just we haven't You know, we're just, we're still working- Listen, Jocelyn is doing the best that she can Considering what little Jocelyn has to work with.
David, personal comments are in bad taste.
Okay, I'm trying to make sense of these flowers.
What is wrong with the flowers?
They're seasonal and they Tie in all of the other design elements that Jocelyn has come up with.
David, I'm sorry, but it's coup d'etat time.
If we don't force Jocelyn to step down this moment, I don't know how we're gonna pull of this nightmare.
Why don't you just sit this one out then?
And you are?
So David?
I see.
Clearly you don't need the help of the most prominent philanthropist in the country.
No.
Fine.
I wish you all the best.
No, seriously, I might leave.
Okay, last warning.
In three two Oh my God.
Well, I think she is gonna be really surprised don't you?
Nine ninety-nine.
And I'm telling you, you can't go wrong.
You go into a jewellery store, you're gonna spend thousands.
We have made it so simple Oh, David, I don't know how you don't go mad with those people.
Well, those people are Putting a lot of energy into raising money for those kids.
Jump ship.
Save yourself.
Okay, I'm gonna ask you to put some pieces together here for me.
We are throwing a "fundraiser" that just so happens to be on the same night as your birthday.
Must you rub it in?
We're throwing a "fundraiser" on your birthday.
Now you're just being cruel.
The fundraiser isn't real.
It's not a real thing.
Oh you're planning a birthday thing - Mm-hmm.
- That I'm not supposed to know about.
Mm-mm.
In a barn?
We can't afford the candles.
They're $2.49.
They don't just come with the cake?
No, apparently not.
Like matches when you buy cigarettes?
- You smoke?
- Um no.
Can't we just ask them to give them to us?
This is not some co-op commune, Alexis.
You know, if there's a price tag on it, you gotta pay for it.
Not if you just take them.
Well, that would be low bottom behavior, wouldn't it?
Okay, well, how do you think I got these glasses from the gas station?
You stole sunglasses?
!
Yeah!
It's a gas station.
Oh my God, I raised a thief.
Go wait in the car!
Wait in the car while I pay for this.
Ugh!
- Hi.
- Hi.
Johnny Rose.
I ordered a birthday cake.
Yeah, Chocolate Ganache?
That's right.
Boy, it smells uh So delicious in here.
Whoa!
Thank you.
There we go, my dear.
Wait, wait, wait.
One last check.
Gorgeous.
Perfection.
Like your father the day I married him.
Look at us, the Roses, attending this town's most illustrious fundraising gala.
I think you're overselling it just a bit.
Well, I don't see any stragglers, so shall we go in?
I think we're fashionably late enough.
There's nothing fashionable about this, but- after you, my dear.
Where are all the patrons?
Well, I don't know.
Do we have the wrong night?
Surprise!
What?
!
There's no fundraiser?
!
You're just here to celebrate me?
Oh, never in the history of surprises has one been so delightfully blindsided.
- Darling - Oh Okay, who told her?
- Oh, hi.
- So your party's a big success.
Congratulations.
- Yeah, thank you.
- Your mom sure seemed surprised.
Yeah, my mom was Very surprised.
And you got your cake.
Yeah, remember this cake?
I'd asked you to Help me get it.
Yeah, so I need to apologize for my behavior earlier.
I think it's just that this whole- it's that lady time, huh?
- Friend thing - Oh.
Is proving to be a bit tricky and I think that in building that barrier up, I may have built it a little high.
Okay.
Um well, if the barrier's come down, can two friends dance?
Is that okay?
Uh I normally only slow dance with strangers, at bars - Right.
- After I've had a few Uh-huh.
But um I can make an exception.
Okay.
- Let's dance.
- Okay.
Hey!
Um you look really Amazing.
Well, I didn't wanna be the only one not wearing a suit.
Um, did you have to kill a man to get it, or ?
I did.
It took me a couple to find one in my size.
But um you clean up well.
Ugh!
Barely.
I wore this thing to prom like a thousand years ago, but it did bring me some luck that night, so I wore it here tonight.
You were planning on getting lucky tonight?
So um where is Ted?
Um he is at um Like a a conference or something tonight, so Do you wanna dance?
Yes I do.
Alexis!
- Ted?
!
- Hey!
What're you doing here?
Well, I had someone take my last seminar.
I didn't wanna miss this.
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
Come on, let's dance.
Great suit, bud.
Thanks.
Killed somebody for it.
Oh, I love my party, John.
But please don't ever do it again.
Well, the surprise was on me 'cause this town cleaned itself up pretty well.
What?
Hey!
W we're getting out.
Oh, my God.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
We're getting out!
We're finally getting out!
Oh my God.
I mean it!
Oh my-oh my God!
Oh my God!
Johnny Told you I'd sell this town.
Didn't I tell you?
Yes.
Not to diminish your accomplishment, but you did say that a handful of times.
I think eight, to be exact.
It bears repeating.
My little suity-cases!
Oh!
David?
Should I take this with me?
If I'm being perfectly honest, it's very low on the totem pole of coats of yours that I like, but It was a gift from your father.
Hey, that's a good coat.
I outbid Richard Branson for it at the Kiminski auction.
I did get sick of having hot coffee and blood thrown at me.
You know who covets this coat?
Jocelyn.
I could bestow it upon her as a parting gift.
We may want to put pen to paper before we start giving away designer clothing, sweetheart.
It would be her first piece of clothing made outside of mainland China.
I'm gonna do it.
Honestly, I cannot wait to get to the beach.
- What?
- Yeah, I'm going to St. Barts with Jenna, Leisha, and Some other girl with an "ah" name that I can't quite remember.
- Huh.
- Why?
What are you doing?
Well, I'm gonna go to New York and um see some people.
Oh!
What people?
You don't know them.
Just people.
I thought everyone just kind of dropped you like flies when you couldn't pick up the tab at the Waverly anymore?
Well, that's absolutely not true.
I just have a different kind of relationship with my friends where we don't need to be in constant contact with each other.
Okay.
You should um come to New York after you're done.
And do what, eat a cronut at a Brooklyn flea market?
Well, I was thinking maybe we could get a A two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan and not have to live in Brooklyn.
Honestly, David, and like no offense, but when I get out of here, I'm gonna get my own place so I can pack how I wanna pack and I don't have to be called a circus freak all the time.
Ding-dong.
- Moira, hey!
- Hi, Jocelyn.
Gosh, you look so glamorous today.
Oh, thank you.
Some days it just works.
Yeah.
So I guess you heard the news.
I heard there was someone interested in buying Yes, we're leaving.
I didn't know it was finalized.
And since we're leaving dear God it feels good to be saying that!
I would like to give you this as a little keepsake to remember me by.
Wow.
Is-is it a wig?
No.
It's a coat.
It's the coat.
What coat?
The coat you kept going on about that one time.
Are you sure it was me?
Oh, it's absolutely tragic, Jocelyn, that I will never see or speak to you ever again.
- Well - But I will have my memories and you will have this incredible coat.
Goodbye, dear friend.
Goodbye, Moira Rose.
Hey!
What're you doing here?
- Um, can I ?

Uh uh Yes!
If I was staying, then yes!
A thousand times, yes!
And if things were different and I wasn't leaving, um, then definitely yes!
So is that a no?
Yes ?
Are you stealing Roland's truck?
Yeah.
It's not exactly a Tesla, but it'll get our bags to the airport.
So you wanted to see me?
Yeah.
I had an idea.
Oh-oh.
What if you came with me to New York?
- What?
- Yeah.
Are you ser really?
Mm-hmm.
- New York?
!
- Yeah.
I don't even know what I would do there.
Oh, you just watch a season of "Girls" and do the opposite of what they do.
It's easy.
You have this like whole life there, with all these fancy friends Who, in my head, at least all dress like you, and I feel like I'd get lost in the mix.
Mm-hmm.
Well, all of my friends will probably be away for the summer and I have found a really beautiful two-bedroom in the East Village.
It's beautiful, so Oh, two bedroom.
Yeah.
I mean, I was looking at three bedrooms, but do I really need an office?
I don't I don't know.
Yeah right.
You're coming!
You're coming to New York!
Pack a bag.
Pack two bags.
How many bags do you have?
I'm saving you from this dumpy town.
See you soon!
Oh, Twyla Oh, hey, Mr. Rose.
I heard you guys were leaving.
Yes, yes, we are, and I just wanted to thank you for all the great service over the past few months.
You're welcome.
Yeah, judging by your tips, I was never really sure.
Oh.
I'll have a coffee when you get a minute.
Johnny, I gotta talk to you.
Listen, uh I don't wanna piss in your punch bowl, okay, but um I got a bad feeling about this buyer guy of yours, Andy - Roberts.
Right, right.
- Roberts.
Very successful.
His family made a fortune in the shelving business.
Okay, fine.
Um He called me while he was bumping uglies with this old lady.
Oh no, really?
But that's not the problem.
The problem is he put me on the speaker phone.
I mean, who would do such a thing?
I mean, that's something you would do.
- As soon as he put me on his speakerphone - No, no, - I thought of you.
- That's not something and I can't deal with another you.
But-but-but don't worry, 'cause - Well, I am worried!
- It'll be fine.
Roland.
- This is the guy who's gonna buy the town?
- Just relax.
Yeah, and here's the kicker The second one was a hooker too!
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, see ya.
See ya.
Excuse me, honey, do you know where I can find Johnny Rose?
I got a meeting with this freakin' douche.
The douchebag is right here.
So you're leaving.
What'd Ted say about that?
Uh he proposed.
Really.
So what'd you tell him?
I told him I was leaving.
But if you weren't, you would?
'Kay, is this a Barbara Walter special or something?
I'm leaving.
That's it.
You don't seem to be crying about it.
I think it's nice you're going back to your natural habitat.
I'm not a dolphin, Mutt.
You know what I meant.
I'm happy for you.
Oh.
I'm glad you're happy about it.
You know, you should really work on expanding your emotional range at some point.
So what you're saying is, he got a little short with you?
You, uh, you weren't quite seeing eye to eye?
So, are we gonna sign this puppy or what?
Oh, there's a good idea!
Andy, I've got the bill of sale right here, and if you wanna put your John Hancock right there on that first tab Whoa-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba.
Hold on a second here.
I think I got a better idea.
- What's that?
- Why don't you come over to the house tonight and try some of Jocelyn's famous mac and cheese.
We can sign this then.
- And cheese - Or or we can sign it now, and then we can dive into some mac and cheese.
- Right here, Andy.
- I I love it.
You know, I could really use a good home-cooked meal.
Well, right after we sign, we can all have one.
And according to Roland here, Jocelyn's hot stuff.
I can't leave town without meeting her.
But then again, if she's that hot what's she doing with this guy?
I can't help it if she's got taste!
Oh yeah, right.
Yeah, taste.
Yeah.
Well, excuse you in that coat!
I know!
Jocelyn gave it to me.
What?
!
Knock-off's are getting so good these days.
Thanks.
I can't wait till winter.
I'm gonna feel like Patty LaBelle.
So you did good work, princess.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Perfect attendance, nothing but glowing reviews.
And you must have done a some number on Mutt.
What do you mean?
His hours were up a month ago, he kept coming anyway.
- What?
- Yeah, maybe he just got bored Or maybe he just likes pretty girls in hippy hats.
Know what I mean, string bean?
That's a lot of bags.
There's still some space for you though, so don't worry!
Yeah so, um, about New York.
Uh, it sounds amazing, but I can't do it, so Wha-what-what-?
Why?
What?
Uh, I don't think we're on the same page with what going to New York means.
Okay.
What does it does it mean something?
Ugh I like you.
I don't want to like you but I do And so sharing a space with you as roommates isn't gonna work for me.
Um so I'm gonna take a pass, but um I'm sure you have a lot of friends who would love to live with you.
Yeah, not as many as you'd think, so Um okay.
Well, thank you for being honest and um I wish I could fix this situation.
Um you've been a great friend.
You've been my o-only friend, so great, nevertheless.
Um you've made my life here survivable.
Survivable.
Thank-thank you.
That is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me.
So now I'm gonna go back to New York by myself and um and you can just stay here then.
Yeah.
I think that's That's how it has to be.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, bye.
Yeah, my granddad Opened our family's first shelf factory in a small town just like this one.
I tell you, this place is bursting with opportunity.
Well, bursting seems to be the operative word.
- Mm!
So good!
- Whoa!
Slow down there, pal!
We got dinner coming and a big desert after - Oh.
- Sex in a pan.
Oh?
Then we'll have dessert!

So did you try it on?
- What?

It's it's great.
- Not too snug?
- Nope.
Buttoned right up.
It zips.

It zipped right up!
You didn't try it on, did you?
No.
Oh, why not?
It's a great coat!
At least let us see it on you.
I gave it away.
I'm sorry.
It just it didn't suit me and I thought about Ronnie and you know she could always use some more feminine pieces in her wardrobe, and so I took it over to her and she really liked it, so I paid it forward.
Well, Jocelyn, there are certain things that are just not done: Smoking in a car with a baby, unless you crack a window; tipping before tax; mixing drinks with cola; and giving away a coat that doesn't belong to you.
It's open.
Hey.
Um I just came to say That we'll be leaving as soon as the sale's signed, so You must be super excited.
Yeah.
Why did you do all that extra community service, Mutt?
Extra community service?
Ronnie said that your hours ended a long time ago, so I like to stay active.
Really?
What do you want me to say?
Well, could it maybe be because of the fact that you Enjoy my company?
Sure.
Don't you even care that I'm leaving?
Of course I care.
- Then what're you doing?
- Why are you yelling?
Okay, I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Mutt, why did you do that extra community service?
You know why!
Why can't you just say it?
What a lovely surprise!
Come on in.
How are ya?
I'm just wondering if my dad is here.

David, what're you doing here?
I'm just wondering when you think we're gonna have the check ready?
