{START OF EPISODE 1}
Excuse me!
Excuse me.
Hi.
I'm Jake Peralta.
All right, all right.
So thrilled to be here today.
As many of you may know, I used to be a cop.
Hey, I was dirty!
I took tons of bribes.
But as a former Detective, uh, I know a thing or two about life sentences.
And, Angie, Marco, you just got slapped with the best life sentence there is: Marriage.
To Angie and Marco.
Make us proud, have a son.
Salud!
Salud!
Good times These are the good times Hey, I love the spray tan, Joey.
Let me take a picture of you.
I want to show this color to the guy who stains my deck!
Congratulations, Tony.
It's a beautiful night.
Hey, you're one of us now.
You know how long I've been waiting for one of you old men to kiss me?
He's a good kid.
Allow us, we'll show you the way Aaahh freak out I gotta say, out of the four of you, I think Vito's the best kisser.
Ah, what a wedding, huh?
Although the meatballs were a little dry.
Dry meatballs.
That's Peralta's signal.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!

Nobody say anything!
Nobody talk!
Get your hands off of me, you piece of Hey, Captain Holt!
Long time no see.
How you doing?
This is not the time, Peralta.
Oh, yeah, that's the stuff.
Ah!
I've missed us.
He's here.
He's here!
Jake's here!
Okay, let's do the prank where we don't even acknowledge him when he comes in.
Okay?
Shh!
Shh!
Everyone, shh.
Back in the nine-nine!
Whoo!
Hoo-hoo-hoo!
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
Played to perfection, Charles.
God, I missed this place.
Let me just soak it in.
Oh, yeah, stale coffee, fingerprinting ink, whatever Charles is fermenting in his desk.
Beans.
Beans.
It's like I never left.
All right, fill me in.
Tell me everything I missed.
Won't take long.
Only three things happened.
Terry chipped his tooth and had a lisp for a week.
Lithen up, theeven.
I'm Thorry, did I thay thumthing amuthing to you?
Anther me, you thun of a bitth!
Number two, Santiago and Boyle wore the same outfit to work one day.
How does it look better on you?
And Captain banned headphones from the office, due to the Gina incident.
And a man and a milk shake Great recap.
Welcome back, Peralta.
Captain.
Everyone has a lot of work.
So you have exactly two minutes to share personal anecdotes.
And those two minutes began when you entered.
You now have Challenge accepted.
Undercover highlights.
Fixed a boxing match, smoked a whole cigar without vomiting, was once in a room with ten guys named Sal, and missed you all so very much.
- Everyone back to work.
- All right, Jake.
Hey.
So Didn't get a chance to say hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Can we talk in private for a sec?
Okay.
So now that we are alone, I have to ask.
Did you arrest a perp named Joe Uterus?
Oh, my God, yes.
I should have told you immediately.
Perp name hall of fame, right?
Oh, yeah.
First ballot.
I mean, it's right up there with Sylvester stools and Janet Storkmuncher.
But also, I just I know we left things kind of weird.
You know, me saying that I liked you.
I'm still with Teddy.
Romantic styles.
Oh.
Good, good.
'Cause I was gonna say, I know we left things weird, because I said that I liked you, but that was a mistake.
You know, I was nervous about going undercover, and I think I just kinda freaked out, and you were nearby, so I didn't mean it.
But that's great.
Good.
Hey, so, Joe uterus, what did he do?
Killed a bunch of stray dogs.
Eh.
Name's funnier than the story.
There's a confused old woman here who wants to talk to a Detective.
Oh, come on!
Another drill?
Hello, my name is Adelaide.
I'd like to report a crime.
So we're just doing one of these every day?
Oh, you got it.
I know you got it.
I want my money.
Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.
Why are we doing this?
It's Captain's orders.
My name is Adelaide Van Hoyt.
I'm 89 years old, and I'm here to report a crime.
Not a problem.
We can help you.
Adelaide Van Hoyt.
Goatee, 6'3".
Hey!
This is a tight 240.
Show Adelaide some damn respect.
Hey, Charles.
You pretty excited about Jake being back?
Yeah, it's like when I was a kid and my grandma came home from the hospital, only better because Jake's not unresponsive.
Huh, every time you talk, I heard that sound that plays when pac-man dies.
Charles, I'm concerned that you're gonna tell Jake about the incident.
Nobody can ever know that we had sex, all right?
I have spent years cultivating a reputation as someone who sleeps with bike messengers or better.
Look, I don't want people finding out about it either.
I don't wanna be known as the office slut.
Yeah, well, Jake's back, and you tell him everything.
No, I don't.
I got aroused last night watching a nature documentary on bees.
I was fine until they went inside the hive.
Oh, you're right.
I'm gonna tell him.
It might not be today, it might not be tomorrow It definitely won't be later than tomorrow.
So pretty much today or tomorrow then.
Peralta, special agent Marx is here to make your transfer back to the NYPD official.
And on behalf of the bureau I wanted to personally thank you for your service.
Bureau.
It's FBI lingo for "FBI".
Yes, I've been a cop for 30 years.
And I've seen movies.
Roger that.
You'll be happy to know that the operation turned out to be one of the biggest Rico busts of all time.
"Rico" stands for "racketeering investigative cop awesome".
I have to ask, do you think "awesome" begins with an "O"?
Yes.
are in custody.
Wait, who got away?
Freddy Maliardi.
The tac team screwed up, hit his apartment up a couple of minutes late, and he disappeared.
But Freddy's, like, the worst of all those guys.
Extortion, terrible breath, murder.
I put "terrible breath" too high on that list.
I should go back undercover, see if any of my contacts can tell me where he is.
No, they're looking for a rat.
And as a former cop, there's no way they're gonna trust you.
I guarantee you they do.
Me and those guys went through some pretty intense stuff.
sing us a song, you're the piano man In the mafia, once you Joel together, you're bonded for life.
Look, you know those guys, but I just think this is too big of a risk.
There's nothing you can do.
Sometimes things are just out of your control.
Not good enough.
Boyle, we're going undercover.
You look amazing.
But you smell really bad.
That's my cologne.
Welcome to the mafia.
Okay, if Freddy's still in town, Benny de Conti will know about it.
He owns the restaurant they all eat at.
He knows everything about everything.
Good.
Hey, when you were undercover, did you, like, have a mafia best friend?
I'm not jealous.
I'm just wondering.
Uh, I don't know, I guess I did a bunch of jobs with a guy named Derek.
Great.
Great.
Derek.
Sounds like a great guy.
Charles, don't do this to yourself, all right?
Okay, fine.
All right, so we're going to the restaurant.
What's my cover?
Am I in the mob?
Ooh, I've got the perfect thing.
A sun hat?
Mafia!
No, just be yourself, a cop.
Benny might think I'm a rat, so I'll go in and talk to him.
Then you come in a minute later with your badge out, pick a fight with me, and punch me in the face.
No, I could never hurt you, Jake.
Well, you gotta hit me somewhere.
Fine, it'll be the balls then.
No!
Just hit me in the face.
Look, if it's so hard, imagine I'm somebody you hate.
- Derek.
- I barely know him!
- Fine.
- Come on.
Captain.
We are done with the drill.
The old lady confessed to a 40-year-old unsolved murder in Rhode Island.
We filled out the interstate file request and remanded her to the custody of her daughter.
Adelaide has successfully transformed back into a giant man, sir.
Well done.
Thank you.
See?
Instead of resisting, it's better to just put your head down, get the job done, and then you can get on with your day.
Hi, my name is Timmy, and I'm lost.
Son of a bitch!
Captain!
I hate to be harsh, but I think that these drills are slightly unnecessary, possibly.
Although you are the boss, and your judgment is impeccable.
And I guess what I am trying to say is thank you.
I agree, with the stuff about the drills, not the spineless ass-kissing.
Sir, I think it would help if we knew why we were doing these drills.
Because I ordered you to.
Resume the drill, Timmy.
And do not do or say anything that a seven-year-old boy would not do or say.
Feel free to consult the script I've prepared.
Okay, but, uh, it's a little stilted.
"I am feeling trepidation at the prospect of a parentless existence".
No kid talks like that.
Those lines were lifted verbatim from my boyhood diary.
Resume the drill!
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
Not for nothing, I heard you were arrested.
- I made bail.
- Ahh.
Look, I'm looking for Freddy.
You seen him?
It's funny.
Lot of people are looking for that guy.
Lot of cops especially.
Didn't you used to be a cop, Jake?
I'm just kidding, man.
I know you, we sang piano man together.
This guy.
I got you.
You got me.
You got me.
Yes, you.
I got.
Yeah.
Look, I can't tell you where Freddy is.
But I can tell you his girl, Bianca, just called in.
You know, Freddy's regular order delivered to her address.
Thank you so much.
See ya.
Well, if it isn't Jake Peralta.
- Mafia crapbag.
- Get out of here, Boyle.
I know that we used to be friends, and during that time we would do all kinds of things together like make plans, but that has changed, all right?
Ahh!
Ow!
- Now the balls.
- What?
Ohh!
What's going on?
You never eat with us.
Or talk to us.
I accidentally smiled at you last week and you shined a laser pointer into my eye and screamed "perv".
Yeah, well, something's about to be revealed that's gonna change my social standing forever.
I'm one of you now.
Prettier and different and better, but I'm one of you.
This is great.
With three people we can have a real massage train now.
Ugh.
- I am so sorry.
- What the hell, Boyle?
What the hell happened?
I-I-I was stressed about hitting you, and my mind disassociate from my body.
I don't even know what I did.
Oh, well, let me remind you.
You punched me, kicked me, spat on me, and then you said: There's more where that came from.
I got a real wet mouth.
You gotta admit, it's a pretty tough line.
No, it's not.
It's weird and sexual, and not in the good way.
The only good news is Benny couldn't possibly think we planned that.
My cover's safe.
All right, Bianca lives here.
I'm gonna go in alone.
If I need backup, I will hit the clicky button on my keys.
- Copy that.
- Time to get back into character.
Cologne me, bro.
Okay, here we go.
Aww!
It stings.
The cuts.
It stings.
Stings!
I can't stop hurting you.
What is wrong with me?
Okay, keep going.
Okay.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I miss my mommy.
This is boring.
Captain's not here, sarge.
You can drop the act.
You can drop your butt.
- You can drop your butt!
- It's okay, I got this.
How about we finish building this tower?
The structure's done, but we've barely started on the landscaping.
I wanna build a spaceship.
I worked so hard on that.
There were stables.
These toys suck.
Okay.
Then I'll get you some better toys Timmy.
- Hello.
- Hey, you're Bianca, right?
Mm-hmm.
I'm Jake.
I'm a friend of Freddy's from work.
I'm looking for him.
Well, which Jake are you?
Are you Jakey lady hands or are you Jakey the Jew?
Well, it feels weird saying this but I hope Jakey the Jew?
Mm.
Jake Peralta.
Freddy actually said I should come by here if I was ever in trouble.
Oh, okay.
Well, Freddy was here, but he left.
But come in.
Come on in.
I got the address somewhere.
Hold on.
So did he say where he was headin' or I heard about you, Peralta.
I know you were the rat.
Get 'em up, get your hands up.
Yeah.
Lady hands.
All right, just stay calm, Bianca.
Empty your pockets.
Okay, reaching in.
Pulling stuff out.
I don't have a gun.
Just a wallet and some keys.
Nothing strange about it, okay?
This is just the clicker for my car.
Jake!
Come on.
It's not a weapon.
Nothing bad's gonna happen if I just click this.
I know what a car key is.
- Yeah, these are them.
- I know!
Oh, crap, my gun.
Oh, come on!
Just get it down!
All right, don't shoot!
That's how people get shot.
Just shut up!
Shut up!
NYPD, drop your weapon.
All right, Bianca.
What do you know about a guy named Derek?
Charles, no.
Jump, Timmy, jump.
Woo!
Now you're having fun.
Sergeant!
Captain, we were just, uh Timmy was cranky.
We're just letting him ti himself out.
Okay, everybody out!
Okay, it's just kinda difficult.
Because of the deflating.
Out.
Now!
Turn on the pump!
I'm very claustrophobic!
Just tell us where Freddy is.
I'm not gonna sell out Freddy.
We're in love.
He introduced me to his children as his favorite assistant.
Come on, he has a dozen mistresses and six girlfriends.
Freddy loved me.
He implied that many times.
There's nobody else, okay.
Yeah, there is.
I just wish I could remember who.
So many people were sleeping with each other.
It's kinda hard to keep track.
Well, I actually thought of a song that helps me remember.
Let's see, it goes Mario is doing it with Teresa Teresa is doing it with Paulie I knew that.
Paulie is doing it with Lisa And Lisa's doing it with Anthony I really like this song.
Did you come up with the melody?
I'm pretty sure I did.
Freddy is cheating with Bianca G. But also with her younger sister Valerie No.
Oh, yeah.
I saw them together, that's why it's in the song.
I knew it!
Ooh, that son of a bitch!
All right, fine.
He's going to the Teterboro airport.
Because Freddy is going to Barbados.
Oh, well, well, well.
Good thing someone came prepared.
We're not going to Barbados, Charles.
We're gonna stop the plane.
Come on.
Right.
Let's go.
Oh, my God.
What is on your sweater?
As everyone knows, my spirit animal is nature's greatest predator, the wolf.
But I committed a horrible sexual blunder and I'm no longer wolf-worthy.
My spirit animal is now this: The naked mole rat, God's disgusting mistake.
Yeah, it's pretty ugly.
Hey!
Only I get to talk about my spirit animal that way.
You don't get to say that.
Come on, Amy.
You're not gonna apologize, sergeant?
No, I was trying to lighten the mood.
The squad's been stressed since these drills started.
Plus you ordered me to act like a seven-year-old.
Seven-year-olds like to have fun.
That's true.
When I was seven I used to sneak into my Father's office to see his collection of antique globes.
Sir, it's hard to motivate the squad when we don't even know why we're doing these drills.
This hasn't been announced yet, but There's gonna be a new commissioner of the NYPD.
We're all gonna be under a microscope.
And I want us to be prepared for anything.
You should have just told us that.
I was trying to shield you.
Do you know how much stress I've been under lately?
My husband says he hasn't seen me smile in weeks.
How much did you smile before that?
Constantly.
I don't know what's going on down at police headquarters.
And no one will tell me anything.
So you're saying that not knowing what your bosses are up to is driving you a little crazy.
You've used my logic against me.
Well played, Timmy.
Well played.
Thank you, sir.
Look at that.
You helped me find my smile.
No, no, no, no, no, no, oh, no!
Dammit!
What do you think you're doing?
Jake Peralta, NYPD.
I need you to shoot down that plane.
I can't do that.
Look.
This man was on board.
I have to follow him, so I need to commandeer one of these planes.
What's the easiest one for a complete beginner to fly?
He wasn't on that plane.
That guy's plane left like an hour ago.
Great.
That's fantastic.
Charles, may I borrow your hat please?
Sure.
It's all right.
High tech rayon, it's fine.
Hey, buddy.
Whatcha doin'?
Oh, just cleaning out my desk.
Trying not to think about how Freddy got away.
Oh, I didn't let anyone touch anything while you were gone.
And that was a mistake.
I left food everywhere.
This drawer is completely full of maggots now.
Eww!
Wanna get a drink?
Nope, I think I'm just gonna stay here and stare into the maggot drawer.
Hey, that's a good name for a death metal song.
stare into the maggot drawer You wanna talk about it?
My death metal album?
Sure.
I meant do you wanna talk about what's wrong?
There's nothing to talk about.
The operation was a failure.
Jake, you put away Yeah, and one of them got away.
It's a disgrace.
You did everything you could.
I mean sometimes there's stuff you just can't control.
Why does everyone keep saying that to me?
You should be proud.
You didn't hold anything back.
Huh, I think I like this new forthright and confident version of Charles.
Let's go get that drink.
Because there's a surprise party and it's my job to get you to the bar.
What?
I mean it's my job to get someone to the bar for your surprise party.
Dammit!
There it is.
Aha, surprise!
What?
No way.
I am floored by this.
Charles, you tricked me.
Boyle told you, didn't he?
Without any prompting.
Welcome to your party.
All right.
Whoo!
Does anyone have a few words they'd like to say?
Bup-bup.
No one say anything.
I want him to say stuff.
Speech for Jake.
Speech for Jake.
Go.
Very well.
Your six-month absence was noted.
Yes.
Drinks are on me.
There's a two-drink maximum per person.
Ah, here he goes.
It is non-transferable.
Uh-huh.
Your guests will pay their own tab.
Oh, yeah.
Valet parking is not included.
Solid protocol.
tomorrow's briefing will be fifteen minutes earlier than usual.
He's so bad at it.
And I'm very proud of you, Peralta.
We missed you.
Aww, you ruined it.
To Jake.
Hey, got you a drink.
Thanks.
What is this?
It's champagne mixed with and top-shelf Tequila.
Captain said a two-drink Max.
But he did not set a price limit.
Smort.
Hmm.
Oh, God.
It's horrible.
Yeah, I shouldn't have added the olive juice.
Eww.
Hey, so listen, the thing I said to you before I went undercover, about how I wished something had happened between us romantically, that wasn't nothing.
That was real.
What are you saying?
I know that you're with Teddy.
I'm not trying to change that.
And I get there's stuff I can't control.
But this morning I told you that I didn't mean any of it, and that was a lie.
I just don't want to hold anything back.
Well, thank you for saying that.
Just as long as we're clear that I'm with someone and nothing is gonna happen.
"I'm with someone, nothing's gonna happen" Name of your sex tape.
He's back.
Neat sweater.
Ugh.
Did you tell Jake yet?
Nope.
Really?
You told him about his own surprise party.
Mm-hmm, first chance I got.
But I had tons of chances to tell him about what happened six months ago, and I didn't.
Why not?
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
Eww.
Pump the brakes, Charles.
Because I'm terrified of you and what you'll do to me.
Oh, that's sweet.
Well, then.
Sound like our nightmare is finally over.
What?
Not a doctor.
Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Okay, great.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks, doctor.
Have a good one.
Hey there, sarge.
Not to pry but I couldn't help but overhear You're going to the doctor?
Everything okay?
I'm getting a vasectomy.
My ears are burning.
Did someone say "vasectomy"?
I got snipped.
No big deal.
Just numbs you out from trunk to skunk for a year.
It's not supposed to.
"Trunk to skunk"?
Hold it up.
You're gonna let some quack doctor just knife around down there?
You are blessed with a great power.
And you should never snip its wings.
You should let it soar.
Thanks guys, that's enough.
I don't need anymore input.
Neither does your wife, I guess.
Look, you guys, if the sergeant wants to chop off his penis, that is his choice.
That's not what a vasectomy is.
If you guys don't get back to work, I'm gonna start firing detectives.
And blanks!
Sorry.
I just never think of jokes.
Anybody else?
This is your last chance.
Oh, God.
No need to be so testes.
Guess you won't be manning the "tip line".
Sergeant, is this gonna go on your "sperm-anent record"?
"Scrotal recall"!
Hey sarge, great news.
I just got assigned such a dope stabbing.
Sorry, the stabbing part is bad.
But here's the dope part.
The guy survived and he owns a chocolate milk restaurant.
Seriously?
I know, right?
Finally, a dumb Brooklyn hipster trend my mouth and I can get behind.
Wanna hop on the case with me?
We're a killer team.
Jeffords and Peralta.
Jake and Terry.
Chocolate and milk.
I mean, I'm the chocolate and you're the milk 'cause you're so full of protein!
Don't be mad!
Just do the case!
Okay, but I have my vasectomy today.
So I need to be back in a few hours to catch my ride to the doctor's.
My neighbor's driving me because my wife's out of town with the girls.
Why don't I drive you?
I don't know.
I guess I didn't really think of you as that kind of friend.
Sarge, I'm every kind of friend.
I'm Phoebe, I'm Chandler, I'm Rachel, I'm Who's the dinosaur guy?
Ross, bro!
Ross!
Sorry, I forgot you were such a ross-head.
So look, we'll work this thing together and afterwards, I will be your friend chariot to the penis-removal of the century.
The new NYPD commissioner is planning a complete reorganization of the force.
But first, he'll be sending a deputy chief to every precinct to conduct a top to bottom evaluation.
What?
When?
Are we gonna be graded?
Or is this just some pass/fail garbage?
Scale of one-to-five.
That's how many letter grades there are.
Feels like they're just being weird using numbers instead of letters.
Yeah, they're being weird right now.
Boyle.
Diaz.
I want the evidence room organized beyond reproach.
Santiago, when I greet the deputy chief, I want you there by my side to make a good impression.
No offense, but you are something of a teacher's pet.
None taken!
People love their pets.
Good news is our evaluation will be done by deputy chief Brandt.
We have a good rapport.
He was once my captain.
So he's kind of like our grand-captain.
That is amazingly funny.
Well, I was closing up around 11:00.
I heard the door open.
I just figured it was some "milkers".
That's what we call our regulars.
Do ya?
Anyway, next thing I know, the guy stabs me in the back like like right here!
Like some kind of psycho wuss!
Can you think of anyone who might wanna harm you?
Yeah.
I mean, you don't get into this line of business to make friends.
Really?
I would think making chocolate milk is a great way to make friends.
I don't have proof, but the guy who did this to me is my business partner, Gregory Phillips.
He's still pissed at me because I banned him from my 'straunt.
He was supposed to be my silent partner, but he wasn't silent.
He was trying to control everything.
Here, try this.
All right, here we go.
Finally!
All right.
Oh!
Ugh!
It's so bitter!
What's wrong with this chocolate milk?
Dark milk isn't chocolate milk.
This is teat-to-mouth raw cow's milk.
The bitterness of the chocolate brings out the sourness in the milk.
That's the worst part of both of those things!
Uh, time for my appointment, Jake.
Yup, got it.
All right, we'll look into this and get back to you.
Okay, sarge.
Hate to be "that kind of a friend," but let's go chop off that penis.
Where were you?
This is chaos.
Gina's been filing evidence by "perp hotness".
I'm so sorry, I just got some bad news.
My sister was gonna go with me to an engagement party but she had to cancel.
So go alone.
Maybe you'll meet some new bag.
It's my ex-wife Eleanor's engagement party.
I can't go alone.
I'm worried it might seem a little pathetic.
Yeah, if only you could've gone with your sister.
Dude, why are you going to your ex-wife's engagement party at all?
She and her fiance, Hercules, are also my landlords.
I mean, it's not like I can avoid them.
I live in their basement.
Hey!
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
No.
You could go with me.
Can't.
I have a date tomorrow night.
Okay.
I will figure something out.
I know!
Maybe if I pay my neighbor, Joann, she'll ditch her wife for the night!
Captain, I don't know if this is too much but I got deputy chief Brandt this little basket of pears.
They look ripe and crispy.
Hello, Raymond.
Captain Wuntch.
Good to see you.
But if you're here, who's guarding Hades?
It's deputy chief Wuntch now.
Unsurprisingly, I've been promoted above you.
And now I'm here to evaluate you.
What happened to Brandt?
He retired and moved to Charleston to be closer to his grandchildren.
So much for dying at your desk with a little dignity.
Interesting.
I will attempt to cooperate with you.
Under these new circumstances.
Don't sweet-talk me, Holt.
I gave it my best shot.
Let's begin.
Hey, hey!
How'd it go?
Is his voice all high-pitched now?
What?
No, of course not.
Of course not.
Jake!
The doctors made me into a superhero!
I am so strong!
And they made me black!
He's on a lot of medication.
We weren't able to do the procedure.
Your friend is so large That you needed a bigger saw to get through his dingus?
No, his body is so physically massive that we didn't have enough anesthesia on hand.
He needs a much larger dose.
Psst psst Jake.
Sometimes I can't tell my twin baby girls apart, so I call them both "boo-boo".
Wow.
So he has no filter whatsoever?
None.
I'm gonna take ya home now, sarge.
Hey, what do you think of captain Holt?
He needs to smoke some weed.
Yes!
Thank you, Dr. Penis-off!
Okay, in ya go.
You're okay.
Whoo!
Cool!
Dude, your head is so small!
Like a No, no, it's so small!
All right.
Where do you keep your brains?
Good.
All right, got your PJS on, read you a story, checked under the bed for monsters.
Check again!
And now it's sleepy-time, so here we go Wait, wait, wait You gotta promise me you won't let them give me the operation.
I wanna have more kids.
I don't want the vasectomy.
Promise me, tiny head!
Promise me!
All right, I promise!
I promise.
Good!
Because I'm not done with my testicles yet.
Okay.
I'm gonna let them sing!
Uh-oh, walk of shame!
Same clothes as yesterday.
I slept at the sarge's.
It was horrible.
Come here Phone!
All right, let's get going and interview that suspect.
I have my make-up vasectomy this afternoon so I'm sorry, your what-what vasectomy?
Last night, you told me you didn't want that.
Then you fell on top of me and changed the shape of my skeleton forever.
No, I definitely want one.
That was the drugs talking.
I was high as a kite.
Did I do this and call you "tiny head"?
Yes.
Some things are coming back to me now.
Oh, that's great.
Tiny head.
Jake, I am so scared that man is about to make a huge mistake, His vas deferens.
I know, he made me promise to not let him get that surgery.
And it wasn't just the drugs.
He doesn't want this.
As his friend, it's my job to stop him.
Sorry, Terry turned my spine into a loose stack of pebbles.
And since my arrival, violent crime has gone down by 17.3%, as you can see here.
Two-toned graphs?
You think you can distract me from the precinct's problems with a flashy presentation?
Same old Ray Holt.
All sizzle, no steak.
I'm off to do some spot-checks.
Oh, my God.
She's totally gonna flunk us.
I haven't gotten an "F" since I failed recess in second grade.
"Teachers need a break too, Amy".
We were doomed the minute she slithered into the precinct.
It's funny.
When we first met, we had some good times.
Looks like we both want that stapler.
Seems that way based on what happened.
So when did it all go south?
for a big promotion, which would've fast-tracked my career.
Wuntch offered to write a letter on my behalf but instead, she torpedoed me because of something that happened the night before she was to turn it in.
Madeline.
Would you care for a drink?
I'd love one.
I'm sure you can tell I'm quite drunk.
I've had a couple to build up the nerve.
I think we both know what I'm about to say.
Raymond I don't think we need to say anything.
I'm gay.
That's what I was going to tell you.
Well, then.
She sabotaged my career because I refused to bed her.
He thinks I stabbed him?
That's crazy.
He said you were furious at him because he banned you from the restaurant and called your business plans "terrible".
The text reads: "Your ideas are dumb-dumb batter in a stupid pancake, you steaming pile of human fences".
I assume that was auto-corrected from "feces".
Look, partners fight.
He's difficult to work with, but I would never try and kill him.
Where were you on monday around 10:00 pm?
Me and my business school buddies get together every monday and have a couple beers.
Also, there's a uh Pilates studio with a huge window across the street so it's a pretty sweet view.
I guess that's not as bad as stabbing someone?
I left around 10:00, I took the subway home, got off at York street, around my house, puked on a statue, went to bed.
Classy.
All right, well, we've taken up enough of your time enjoy the rest of your day and go back to your life as "a pile of human fences".
Okay, let's see if any of DRK MLK's neighbors saw the pilates perv or anyone else fleeing the scene of the crime.
Copy that.
We'll do some cop stuff, have a heart-to-heart about your vasectomy, cancel your vasectomy, grab some drinks, laugh about the time you almost got a vasectomy.
Stop worrying about my vasectomy, man.
Maybe you should focus on your own body.
When's the last time you had a carrot?
Well, it's my least favorite type of cake, so rarely.
If I absolutely have to, I'll just eat the frosting.
Hey!
Cut it out, cake boy.
You're making health insurance more expensive for everyone else!
Yeah?
Well, you know what else drives up premiums?
Unwanted genital removal!
Thank you for coming.
I wasn't sure if you'd get my message.
Charles, it was kind of hard to miss.
Oh, God!
Hey, I didn't know what to do.
You said we weren't allowed to talk at work now that we're knocking boots.
Ew, gross.
Listen, my ex-wife's throwing an engagement party this weekend and I was wondering if you wanted to go As friends.
No, Charles, just because we have secret, shameful sex does not mean we are friends.
Forget friends.
Let's go as "bone bros".
Ugh!
I didn't strike you when you said "knocking boots," but "bone bros"?
I cannot abide.
Have you seen this man around DRK MLK.
Oh, I don't go there.
They don't allow babies in there.
What is wrong with them?
All I drank when I was a baby was chocolate milk.
Well, thank you for your time.
And thank you, adorable little baby, who's probably giving my partner some mixed feelings right about now.
"Don't get the operation, sarge!
Instead, make a tiny muscular friend for me to play with"!
That's enough.
I'm with you.
That's enough, baby.
Mind your own business.
I haven't heard of DRK MLK and I've never seen this man before.
This is your lead?
Why are we here?
Well, according to the Internet, Dr. Mindel is the best couples counselor in the Park slope area, who accepts same day walk-ins.
Couples counseling?
Sorry for wasting your time.
Wait, please don't leave.
This cost me so much money.
I am so sorry.
He's walking out.
Just like your father did.
Wait a minute, I didn't tell you about that.
Didn't have to.
You are good!
Sarge, wait up!
Come on, don't be mad!
Look, I'm only trying to protect you from your very stupid self.
That is enough, Jake!
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
And the things you said when you were whacked-out were real.
You made me promise.
And as your friend I told you, Jake.
We're not that kind of friends.
Not what kind of friends?
"Friend" friends.
You and I are work friends.
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm going to the doctor's office.
Not good enough.
Prepare to be physically overpowered by a "friend" friend.
Argh!
Cancel the appointment!
I've got you!
You can't move.
Concede defeat, sir.
You have been conquered.
Spot-checks are done.
Needless to say, I thoroughly underwhelmed.
Huh.
From your expression, I would've guessed constipated or chilly.
Excuse me, captain, I don't want to say that I saved the day, but I will because I did.
So The letter of recommendation she wrote for you 25 years ago.
Where'd you get this?
I just went down to one police plaza and applied some of my signature Amy charm.
And then when you wouldn't stop, they just gave it to you?
More or less.
The point is, the letter's very positive.
You thought she wrote mean stuff about you because of the Night before.
But she didn't.
It was all a misunderstanding.
Wait a minute You thought I cost you that promotion because you're gay?
That's what you've been mad about all these years?
It's one reason.
I don't care that you rejected my advances.
Your sexual identity is the one thing I actually respect about you.
Then what are you mad about?
I'm mad because you tried to get me thrown off the force.
Yeah, because you shot me.
I shot you because you were in the wrong position.
You weren't following orders.
What about the time you destroyed my personnel file while I was undercover?
What if there had been a mole?
You were trying to make me disappear.
You embarrassed me in front of Derek Jeter!
You embarrassed yourself in front of Derek Jeter.
Hey, Rosa!
Better file me under "E" for "edgy".
- What?
- Cornrows!
Why?
My ex-wife and her fiance go to Jamaica all the time.
"Jamaican me marry you".
So good!
So I still don't have a date.
Unless this sweet maize-head has changed your mind.
I think we both know it hasn't.
We do.
Fair enough.
Why do you look so terrible?
I tried to stop sarge from getting his tubes tied.
But he somehow managed to sneak off to the hospital.
Zip that lip!
He's doing it?
He wouldn't listen to me.
He said I was a "work friend".
Ah, that chills me.
And it reminds me of a story.
I had this sweater, and it was a work sweater because it only seemed work apropes, but then one time, I wore it out to dinner and I was like, "oh, dang!
This sweater is cute everywhere".
I get it.
I'm the sweater.
No.
And I have to show the sarge I can be a good friend to him outside of work too.
No!
Thank you, Gina.
I'm gonna stop him.
Jake, I have no idea what you're talking about, but good luck!
Well, good-bye, Raymond.
Anything you'd like to say to me before I complete my evaluation?
Something in the form of groveling?
Never.
Fail me if you must.
You're just gonna let her fail us?
I'm sorry about your precious grade, Santiago, but this isn't about you.
Don't "this isn't about you" me!
I'm "this isn't about you"-ing you!
That grade is the only thing standing between me and a future where you're not my captain anymore.
Wuntch failed the nine-oh and their captain was fired.
I attempted to cajole her but she rebuffed me.
I'm not a man of unlimited cajoling.
Well, you better become one because I need you in command.
This precinct needs you in command.
Cajole up, captain.
Sarge, hey!
What the hell are you doing here, tiny head?
You better not be trying to talk me out of my surgery again.
Look, I'm not trying to talk you out of anything.
I'm just here to give you a ride home and to prove to you once and for all that I'm more than just a work friend.
Thank you, microscope head.
Hey, a little bit of good news!
I figured out the case!
Remember Gregory said he got off at the York street station the night of the stabbing?
Well, I took the subway here and it's closed for construction.
Hmm So what you're saying is I stabbed him.
I did it.
You know what?
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
See you on the other side.
Jake, you were right!
I don't want the surgery, Tiny Head!
NYPD!
Put down the scalpel and step away from my work friend's weiner-tubes!
Looking good, Boyle!
Ugh, that's not a good sign.
Hey, mon.
Rosa You changed your mind!
I blew off my date, and instead, I'm going to spend a hellish evening in a Jamaican torture chamber with you.
Really?
Yeah.
Here's what's about to happen.
We're gonna go to this terrible party, I'm gonna laugh at all your jokes, gonna talk about your medal of valor, and I'm gonna make you look like a Jamaican God of rhythm.
Sebastian from the little mermaid.
Also, tomorrow, I'm gonna help you find a new apartment.
You can't live in your ex-wife's basement anymore.
Wow!
Respect, mon.
I'm gonna read you my toast in the car.
You're giving a toast?
More like we're giving a toast.
There we go.
Jake, I have to tell you something.
Oh, boy.
I am a little conflicted about having a vasectomy.
Really?
Is that why you threw an EKG machine at the doctor?
I'm sorry I thought of you as a work friend.
You're here, man.
You're a friend friend.
You made Terry get real with himself and his genitals.
Your tiny head has a big heart inside it.
I know that's scientifically wrong, but thanks, sarge.
I'm gonna talk to my wife when she comes home.
You're a huggy good friend.
No!
Not again.
Santiago, we received our grade.
Oh, my God.
Is this good-bye?
There's still so much I have to say to you.
Mediocre.
But enough for you to stick around.
How did you get her to change her mind?
I had to compromise everything I stand for.
You are now, and always have been, the superior police officer.
And?
The Derek Jeter thing was my fault.
I'm sorry you had to go through that.
No, you were right.
This is the best job I've ever had and it would be foolish to give it up over a petty feud.
Here, this is for you.
It's a grade for your performance these past few days.
A letter grade, so as to not be "weird" about it.
Oh, my God.
You really shouldn't have.
An "a".
Thank you.
Just curious, does your system have pluses in it, or is, like, "a" the highest?
How'd the interrogation go?
Gregory confessed to the stabbing.
Nice work.
I just talked to my wife.
We're waiting on the operation, everything's cool.
Did you tell her we slept together twice?
Thanks for taking care of me.
I got you a present.
Do you know what a present is, Terry?
I care about my friends.
Now eat your carrots, or I'll rip your tiny head off.
No!
No!
No!
Come here.
I hate being friends with you!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Ugh, motorcade duty.
So boring.
I honestly would rather sit around and listen to you talk about the right way to make paella.
There's more than one right way to make paella, Jake.
There are ten right ways.
You got classic Valencian, modern No, wait, stop.
I changed my mind.
I've made a horrible mistake.
Hey, Rosa, just who I was looking for.
Quick question, can I have your friend Katie's phone number?
I want to ask her out.
No, I don't mix personal and professional.
You're never getting her number.
Never like, "we're never gonna have a black President" never?
'Cause that happened.
A real never.
Like if you ever ask me about this again, you're never gonna be able to eat without a straw.
Yeah, okay, well you are on the wrong side of history, my friend.
Katie, huh?
Wow, I can't believe you're not still pining for Amy.
I mean, I pine for years.
I still think about Mia, the nurse that helped my nana pass.
Yes, I know.
You've told me, like, a hundred times about the time your nana collapsed and accidentally pulled Mia's pants down.
Best day of my life.
I don't have feelings for Amy anymore.
So time for me to get out there and spread my w Legs.
Get out there and spread my legs?
Well, e-either way.
No, not either way.
Only wings.
Listen up.
There's been an issue with the motorcade.
The serbian President is delayed in Washington, and we can't start locking down intersections until he takes off.
Apparently he's on an important call with the Albanian President.
Is that bujar nishani or is it still bamir topi?
Oh, ames, let me check.
Hmm, it just says no one likes you.
There's a three-hour delay, minimum.
Captain Holt and I will have to leave for a meeting at one police plaza.
You should all stay prepped and ready.
Dismissed.
Guys.
Guys, guys, guys.
Three-hour delay with no Holt or Terry?
Do you have any idea what this means?
Makeovers.
No, Charles.
The Jimmy jab games!
Yeah!
The first Jimmy jabs were held in 2008, when the King of Iraq President, Iran.
Armen Jimmy jab.
Ahmadinejad.
Came to New York, and were on call for nine glorious hours in case there were protests.
On that day, a young genius named Jake Peralta used the last piece of his bagel to create the first Jimmy jab event.
The monster mouth bagel toss.
Oh.
And the rest was history.
As soon as Holt and Terry leave, we will commence with Jimmy jab seven, circus of fools.
Jimmy jabs Jimmy jabs.
Jimmy jabs.
Jimmy jabs.
Jimmy jabs!
Jimmy jabs!
Jimmy jabs!
Seems like we're ready for our meeting with deputy chief Wuntch.
Is that how you plan on sitting?
Leaning back like a matinee-goer?
Madeline will eat you alive.
That's no better.
Hands folded on your lap like a pervert.
Sir, what are you so nervous about?
There's a new drug in the precinct, and we need updated narcotics field kits.
All we're asking for is $1,200.
How could she say no to that?
Sergeant, as long as I'm asking for it, Madeline Wuntch can say no to anything.
Ugh, may I?
Those are my tissues, Raymond.
If you were planning on sneezing, you should have brought your own.
Sir, she's a deputy chief.
I'm sure she wants what's best for the community.
She doesn't care about the community.
She only cares about defeating me.
This is war, sergeant.
The war on Wuntch.
Oh, good.
You've named it.
So Jimmy jabs, huh?
What do you say we make it interesting this year?
Aha!
We could play for Katie's number.
No.
Is this why you wanted to do Jimmy jabs?
No.
Yes.
Why?
What gave it away?
You said, "aha" and snapped your fingers.
Ah.
Oh, you wanna go out with Rosa's friend Katie?
That's great.
She's cool.
I know, but Rosa has this dumb rule about not mixing work with personal stuff.
That's actually not a bad policy.
I once gave my aunt a jaywalking ticket, and things really deteriorated between us.
Hmm.
But Jake and Katie would be awesome together.
I know, right?
She's single.
I'm single.
She's pretty.
I'm pretty.
So it's settled.
If I win the Jimmy jabs, you give me her number.
And if I lose, you don't have to give it to me.
I already don't have to give it to you.
All right, I'll give you $200, and I'll never ask you for another phone number again.
Done.
Hello, Gina.
It's daylight, Boyle.
Why are we talking?
This is an emergency.
I've been filming my fitness routine with the precinct camera to help improve my form.
That's where I got these tree trunks.
But I realized that I left the tape in the camera, and now it's gone.
Who cares?
Who cares?
Who cares?
You probably will.
Oh, Boyle, I love that you're trying to step up your sex game.
But strength is not your issue.
Stop humming.
And it does not turn me on when you bend over and back up into me.
Did someone check out the camera this morning?
Yes, Hitchcock.
And if he sees it, he will tell everyone.
You need to get that damn tape.
Okay.
We're off.
You'll get word when the serbian President is wheels-up.
You got it, sarge.
We'll just be here till you get back.
Calmly and respectfully prepping.
All right, they're gone!
Ceremonial bagel.
Flask.
Flame.
Jimmy jaaaaaabs Jimmy jaaaah-aaaah Aaaaah-aaaaah-aaaaah Ooooh Let the games begin.
Welcome to the Jimmy jabs.
We play for pride.
We play for the phone numbers of Rosa's friends.
But most importantly, we play to watch Amy lose.
Nope.
This is my year.
It's my year too.
Please don't align yourself with me.
Why not?
Neither of you have ever come close to winning.
You're exactly the same, just a couple of santiagos.
But the real prize is the Winchester 3000, the only chair in the precinct with minimal staining, good lumbar support, and no broken rolly-wheels.
Over to you, Gina.
Thank you, Jake.
Okay, guys, as usual, the loser of each event is eliminated from the games.
The winner gets a bonus in the final round.
Our first event is "The mouthathon".
In front of you is month-old Chinese food from the fridge.
Go ahead and eat as much as you can stomach.
On your mark, get set, wahlberg!
Ugh!
I can't do this to my mouth.
She's the love of my life.
Charles is eliminated.
Ugh, I think this ball of soup is off.
I'm out!
I can do this.
I wanna win so bad.
Oh, great.
Here, quick.
Let me take a picture.
Oh, that's so cute.
You've got a little bit of mold on the tip of your nose.
I tried.
I tried, but he's unbeatable.
You guys know this is free, right?
Hello, deputy chief Wuntch.
You've aged.
Stay seated.
We can do this out here, since you've already made yourselves comfortable.
Sergeant Jeffords, why don't you just lie down?
I can't sit any straighter than this.
We're here about a new and very potent form of ecstasy, which has surfaced in our precinct.
Street name, giggle pig.
Hmm, an embarrassing blight growing right under your nose.
Not unlike that moustache you had when we first met.
That moustache was era-appropriate.
The precinct just needs updated field kits to help us combat the problem.
This paperwork is a mess.
A semicolon that should clearly be a full colon?
Was this prepared by a recent immigrant?
It's just one typo.
It's gibberish.
Request denied.
Wow.
You were right.
All it took was one mistake.
You think that semicolon was a mistake?
No, it was a juicy piece of bait, and she unhinged her jaw and swallowed it whole.
So you wanted her to say no to us?
Rejecting a valid request for such a petty reason, that's all the ammunition I need to go over her head.
I secretly scheduled us a one-on-one with Madeline's boss, chief fisker.
You wanna hear the funniest thing ever?
I also split and infinitive, and she didn't notice.
Hey, buddy.
Did you check out the department video camera by any chance?
Yeah, I was gonna take it home and videotape the top of my head.
I think I might be thinning up there.
Cool, cool.
So I accidentally left a tape in there, and I want it back.
Why?
What's on it?
Nothing.
I just really need it for no reason.
Well, if you want that tape back, I gotta get something in return.
Are you blackmailing me?
I don't have any money, Hitchcock.
I'm still paying my uncle's funeral bills.
I rear-ended the hearse.
It was a mess.
There's one thing I want, and it's not that big.
I just want you to make me cool in everyone's eyes.
Not that big?
The Jimmy jabs has claimed its first victims.
Boyle, you made no impact.
Also, Detective Scully has withdrawn due to food poisoning, which I think we all saw coming.
All right, the second event is "bulky bulky run run," the bomb suit foot race.
Sure hope I don't sprain my arm during the face, 'cause I'm gonna be opening up a lot of doors for Katie on our date.
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a gentleman.
What are you doing, Jake?
Trash talking you, while simultaneously proving that I will be respectful of your friend.
It's a tough line to walk.
Gotta loosen up my flower-buying fingers.
I'm gonna go nuts on the daisies.
On your mark Get set Ruffalo!
Go!
I'm doing it, Charles!
I look cool!
Whaaow!
The next event will be "keep your cover".
Contestants must craft an undercover persona and talk to as many police officers as you can before being recognized.
Pregnant.
Nice.
Means ya had sex.
Damn right, I did.
And I forgot my birth control.
Yeah!
Yah!
I think the belly will draw attention away from my face.
Smart.
Like one big boob.
Mm-hmm.
Jake will go first, then Amy, then Rosa.
On your mark, get set, Paul gosselaar!
Please let me have the tape.
No dice.
I don't know how to make you cool.
I'm not even that cool myself.
I mean, sure, I have a pizza stone.
You have cool friends.
Like Jake.
I just wanna be part of a conversation where Jake uses my name and nobody insults me.
Damn it!
You ask too much.
Ahh.
I blew it.
I only got through two people.
He's kicking so much.
You wanna feel?
No!
That's a bad idea!
Oh, my baby!
It's on the side!
Oof.
I got to six.
Dumb baby!
People are right They ruin everything!
Hey, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I wanna try.
Let me be pregnant.
Whoop!
Adorable.
Right?
I can't believe I lost again!
I was so psyched up for this.
What happened?
Well maybe being so psyched up is what happened.
Like every time we're doing police work, you're always super-smart and you stay calm and take your time, but every time we do dumb games like this, you get all frantic and act like a crazy idiot.
My advice next time don't act like a crazy idiot.
Thanks.
That's surprisingly insightful.
Yeah, well, motherhood Really opens a man's eyes.
I finally feel as if I'm part of something bigger than myself.
All right.
Too much?
Yeah.
Peralta.
What the hell?
Where were you?
I got eliminated.
'Scuse me, officer.
Yes, sweetheart.
Sweetheart?
Seriously, Hank?
Is that how you talk to women who come in here?
Jimmy jabs.
I didn't even make it past one person.
You're out?
I'm in the finals?
And all I have to do to get Katie's number is beat Amy?
Oh, that's nothing.
Hey!
Don't you dare touch Amy Junior.
That's right.
It's your baby!
Are you sayin' I knocked you up?
You sure did!
Jake.
Hmm?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, sure thing.
Hold that.
- Sure.
- All right, Jake You wanna call off the bet?
Seriously?
You're gonna back out now just 'cause you're losing?
What is this, a riverboat casino on the river of no rules?
No.
I'm giving you a chance to call off the bet because it's clear you don't actually want Katie's number because you're still into Amy.
What?
That's crazy.
I just spent the whole day fighting for another girl's number.
Tsk.
You spent the whole day flirting with Amy.
Yeah, we're joking around because we're friends now that I've moved on.
Then prove it.
Beat Amy and don't flirt with her at all.
Fine.
Easy.
But you better tell Katie to clear her schedule out thursday for a date, 'cause I am working nights until then, and the following weekend, I am out of town.
Let's do this!
Hey, Jake.
Question for ya.
When I beat you, which victory dance should I do?
This one?
Or this one?
Oh, wow, okay.
Both are examples of victory dances.
No comeback?
After I burned you with those moves?
You must be pretty nervous.
Yep.
Hey, Jake.
Hey, Charles.
Who's this with me?
Hitchcock?
Well, we should go now.
Wow!
What a high!
Do you guys feel this way all the time?
I did what you wanted.
Give me the tape.
Oh, no, we're not done yet.
Next, I want you to tell everyone you think I'm handsome.
Make it seem natural.
You are a monster!
So they're calling the drug "giggle pig"?
Chief fisker.
Sergeant Jeffords.
Raymond.
Deputy chief Wuntch.
I didn't realize you'd be attending.
I can tell.
You have more of a fly-catching gape than usual.
I've examined his proposal.
There's no proof that giggle pig is a serious problem.
So we're just supposed to wait until it turns into an epidemic?
You're like the league of nations in '36 Just hoping the abyssinian crisis resolves itself.
That's the lesson you draw from the fall of addis ababa?
Raymond, you sound so naive.
And you sound just like Victor Emmanuel III.
I have no idea who's winning.
I am.
Captain Holt, how serious a threat do you really think giggle pig poses?
Very serious.
Or it could be nothing.
Or it could be the new crack.
The new crack?
And you only need $1,200 to fight it?
Well, in an ideal situation, we would attack the problem with a lot more fire power, perhaps even a task force.
That makes sense.
Let's make it happen.
That was amazing!
We got a task force!
More importantly, Wuntch got served.
Oh, my God.
Wuntch sounds like lunch.
Now, this opens up so many new avenues You got your task force.
I'm surprised.
That's funny, after 20 years, I'd think you'd be used to me slam-dunking in your face.
I'm surprised you didn't see what was going on in there.
I got you riled up, you oversold giggle pig, and now you're running an expensive task force in a time of budget cuts.
You better make some big arrests and quick, or you'll be the poster boy for departmental waste.
Slam dunk returned.
Not if we make those arrests.
You guys really don't know enough about basketball to be doing this.
Join hands, one and all, for we have reached the final event of the Jimmy jabs the obstacle course.
Good luck.
You're gonna need it.
Yes.
We all need luck.
Thank you for offering me some.
On your mark, get Seth - Rogen!
- Go, Amy!
Contestants must make it past the barricade hurdles then use a bean bag gun to get a snack.
Ah!
You will eat the snack in its entirety.
Ah!
Mmm!
Come on Close, close, close, close!
Ah!
Ugh!
Next, head down to the first floor where you will locate a pamphlet about bullying.
Then print out a picture of me using a laptop from 1982 whoever grabs their printout first is the winner!
Aah!
Surprise twist!
Aah!
What are you doing, Santiago?
Go!
Aah!
You're burning my skin!
No broken rolly wheels!
I did it!
I took my time, I wasn't a crazy idiot, and I won!
I finally wo-on Oh, yeah Yes!
Ye What's going on here?
Someone answer him now!
Santiago!
Peralta!
Boyle?
Hitchcock is very handsome.
Why, thank you, Boyle.
No one has anything to say?
Captain, what you just saw was the Jimmy jab games.
It's a bunch of dumb contests we play to kill the time.
Nobody even cares who wins.
I won!
It's stupid, but we like it.
Clean this up.
Now.
Boyle, I'm ready to take this to the next stage.
You're gonna pierce my ear wait.
What are you doing in my locker?
I can't do this.
I can't make you look cool.
Because you're afraid that Jake and I are gonna cut you out.
Well, you're not wrong.
I'm gonna find that tape.
You think I'd just leave something that valuable lying around?
I got it on me.
Oh!
Gimme that tape!
Ah!
Gimme that tape!
Jake!
Help me!
Ugh!
Ah!
Uhh!
Ugh!
The serbian President's plane is wheels up.
Report to your motorcade positions immediately.
Let's go!
Hey, you gave it a good try.
Sorry you lost.
No.
It's for the best.
I let Amy win.
Close, close, close, close!
Ah!
Oh!
You're right.
I'm not over her.
Boyle, get out.
I need to talk to Jake.
Okay.
Bye!
I warmed up the seat.
Ugh, he did warm up the seat.
It's like a fire pit.
Look, if you're here for your $200, can I interest you in a check that will definitely bounce?
No.
You will pay me in cash.
Ok.
Look, I thought I was over Amy, but clearly I'm not, you know?
I'm as frustrated as you are.
I'm not frustrated.
But I am not enjoying this.
It is not like you to get hung up on a girl.
I don't know what to do.
You call Katie.
That's what you do.
Only way to move on is to move on whether you think you're ready to or not.
Gotta get out there, man.
All right.
Thank you.
Good luck.
Are you okay, sir?
I don't want to sound dramatic, but today has been sub-optimal.
That doesn't leave this office.
Muntch beat me.
The squad was a disaster.
And in the end, you know who I'm angriest with?
Yourself?
No.
Muntch.
I need this task force to succeed, and there's not a Detective here who's adult enough to lead it.
Peralta and Santiago were cowards, Diaz was disrespectful, and I just saw Hitchcock and Boyle fighting like children.
Get off Get off me!
Hitchcock Gimme that tape!
You're squeezing my boobs!
Sir, I know you think Rosa disrespected you, but I found her inspiring.
She did what I should have done Stand up and tell you the truth.
And what truth is that?
First, everyone else made this Wuntch-lunch connection instantly.
Second, Wuntch didn't beat you.
She saddled me with this task force.
You think she's consumed with pettiness?
You're no better.
Yes, the task force is risky, but it gives us a chance to do a lot of good in the community.
Sir, if you ask me, you're acting like a real Victor Emmanuel III.
You used that insult completely incorrectly.
But I suppose I have let Madeline distract me from our purpose.
Which is why I think Rosa should lead the task force.
There's no B.S. with her.
Agreed.
Thank you, sergeant.
And I know you were lying about that Wuntch-lunch thing.
That was mine.
How was the motorcade?
Any assassinations?
No.
It was boring.
Mmm.
Well, thanks for getting the tape back.
Oh!
Oh, guys!
Oh!
I'll see you tonight at my place?
God, I hate you.
Don't be late.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Attention, boys and ghouls.
Nope.
Every Halloween, I dress up in an amazing costume, - and you never get what I am.
- No, we get what you are An adult man who enjoys dress-up.
Very funny, Rosa.
This year, that won't be a problem because you're gonna pick my costume.
Uh, Ms. Pac-man's nipple.
No, that's brown.
Why would you know that?
- To be or not to be!
- Not to be.
Thank you.
Joan of Arc.
Rod Stewart.
Martha Stewart.
He-man!
Master of the universe.
I got it.
Gay Robin Hood.
Yes!
That's it, that's it.
That's what it is.
Oh, hey there, Captain.
Just curious, do you happen to know what today is?
Well, based on the fact that yesterday was the birthday of legendary Dutch flautist Frans Bruggen, and a week ago it was october It's Halloween.
Just say it's Halloween.
It's Halloween.
All right, and what happened last Halloween?
Oh, I listened to the CD I bought the night before, the Frans Bruggen birthday concert.
Please stop saying Bruggen.
Last year, you bet me that you could steal my medal of valor.
And you did.
Consequently, I was forced to do your paperwork for a week and to say words I thought I'd never have to say.
Jake Peralta is an amazing detective/genius.
But now it's time for round two of our Halloween bet.
This year, I believe I'll make things more difficult for myself.
Let's say, what, I'll steal the watch right off your wrist.
Or we could just not do it at all this year.
What?
Sir, with all due respect, come on, homey!
No?
It's not worth all the trouble, just so you might call me an amazing captain/genius and give me one week of overtime for free.
All right, fine, I'll double the overtime.
I'll triple it!
I'll quadruple it!
I will five-druple it.
I'll five-druple the overtime.
Got his attention.
He's coming back to me.
Just to clarify.
If you steal my watch by midnight, I will do your paperwork for a week, but if you fail, you will give me five weeks of overtime for free.
Correct.
I'm doing a cost-benefit analysis in my head.
The benefits outweigh the costs.
We have reached an accord.
Accords!
Handing out these safety pumpkins to neighborhood kids is a cornerstone in community relations.
And putting them together is a boring-stone in testing my patience.
We can use an assembly line so it'll go quicker.
Ooh, that's a great idea, Terrence.
However, is there any way I can skip doing that and instead, not do that?
I have an urgent matter to attend to.
Okay, no problem.
Just come back and help us when you're done.
Thank you.
I'll leave you guys with this.
One-duhl plus one-duhl equals Tootles.
Seriously, sarge?
You're just gonna let her go?
Look, a year ago, I would've been thinking the same thing, but I've learned to give her the benefit of the doubt.
What kind of urgent matter could Gina possibly have to attend to?
She's already checked herself out in every reflective surface around the precinct.
Including my lip gloss.
She said she looked better when I frowned.
I was behind the door!
Greetings, comrades, and welcome to the most important briefing of your lives.
As you all know, the Holt-Peralta Halloween bet has been made, and the clock doth tick.
What's with the tux?
I decided to class up this year's event.
I bought it off a disgraced magician, and it is chock-full of scarves.
What?
How?
A real magician never tells, young man.
Now, let's get started.
I've been planning this for three months.
You've all been given a specific role and a code name.
Rosa, you're the dagger.
Sarge, the hammer.
Amy, the hall monitor.
Yeah, suck it!
Scully and Hitchcock, I'm just gonna call you your real names so you don't get confused.
- Smart.
- What?
And, Boyle, as requested, you will be the deuce.
Although I still think you should reconsider that code name.
Nope, deuce.
It's like ace, but twice as cool.
It is not.
It's a turd.
Now, because of last year, the captain will suspect that you are all helping me, so we will never get anywhere near his watch, but the actual theft will be pulled off by Dan McCreary, aka "fingers".
How you doing?
Call me "fingers".
Hey, I remember this guy.
That's probably because you've arrested him twice for pickpocketing.
You have a criminal helping you?
That's crazy!
Grow up, Amy.
Now, we will all work together as a team to move the captain into position.
Once there, fingers Loving that code name Will remove the captain's watch and replace it with this replica watch.
Oh, that is a very dead dove.
Ooh!
All right This replica watch.
Jake, if he's been arrested before, how do you know he's any good?
Perhaps this will answer your question.
Fingers!
Whoa.
That's our stuff.
My croissant.
But where's the smoked Turkey?
Check your breast pocket?
Come on!
Let's win this bet!
Salutations, Captain.
I was wondering perchance if you would like to attend the opera with me this Eve.
I'll pass, choosing instead to stay in my locked office with my watch still safely on my wrist.
I had a feeling you might say that.
Thusfore, I have decided to bring the opera to you.
Hitchcock, Scully!
Oooo fortuna Now, hammer, it's time.
It's hammer time.
I love life.
You're up, dagger.
No need for the somersaults.
Disagree.
Hall monitor, now!
Okay, Boyle, and only because you insisted I say this, it's time to drop a deuce.
And now, the Jake and bake.
Whoa, come on, Amy!
Not cool!
That's a guy!
Peralta, that's enough!
Sir, sir.
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted somebody to check my son's candy.
Please, let me help you up.
On behalf of the nine-nine, I apologize.
Fingers has grabbed the package.
I didn't mean for that to sound so dirty.
I'll have someone check your son's bag of candy immediately.
Clark.
Thank you, sir.
If you need anything, please, contact me.
I'll do that.
Thank you.
The replica is on the wrist.
Game over.
I know all this was done in the spirit of a friendly bet, but this all went too far.
Am I understood?
- Peralta!
- Yes, sir.
Completely understood, sir.
I'm sorry.
But not as sorry as you're going to be at midnight, when you realize you've lost everything.
Hello there, Hank.
I believe a tall, nimble-fingered man named McCreary left a package for me.
- Yeah, it's here.
Give me a sec.
- Thanks.
Ooh, I'm gonna make a movie of you receiving the watch.
Here.
Let me pinch your lips and make fulsome.
Don't touch my face.
Fine, but if you have dull lips, that's on you.
This is Charles Boyle for Jake Action News.
Thank you.
Okay, open the box.
Here we go!
That's weird, it's just a note.
"Thanks for the watch"?
Oh, no!
McCreary stole the captain's watch!
Breaking news, there's been a terrible development.
Not now, Charles.
Good call.
Media blackout.
We're okay.
It's not over yet.
I still have two hours to find fingers and get Holt's watch back.
But how?
He could be anywhere.
He could be in Canada by now.
There are so many forests up there.
That country is one giant hiding place.
Boyle, I kinda need you to be positive right now, okay?
Yes, sorry.
Damn my mouth.
All right, let's look up McCreary's arrest records, past addresses, known associates.
Peralta.
Run, deuce, run.
If you'll excuse me, sir, I have to Make urines in de toilet.
Yeah, that's how people say words.
I'd like to ask a favor.
Can we please press pause on this bet for ten minutes?
Sure, or we could press fast-forward, and I could watch you talk like a chipmunk.
Peralta, I'm very disappointed in you.
Yes, that would be very funny.
How do you ruin everything?
Kevin is bringing dinner for me, and I don't think he'd appreciate this bet we made.
This watch was given to me by his father just before he died.
Oh!
A death watch, cool.
Please, never call it that.
Copy that.
Oh, you know what?
You can have the ten minutes, no problem.
Love you, bye.
Boyle, fingers just texted.
He said he wants to meet up.
Yes.
Let's get outta here.
Be cool.
Holt's watching.
Pretend I just said something really funny.
- Get outta here.
- We gotta go.
Enjoy the vest and the light.
You'll be so safe, it's scary.
Lame.
That kid gets it.
Thanks for finally joining us, Gina.
We had to stuff 400 of these things without you.
Great seeing you guys.
Unfortunately, I cannot stay long.
I just came to grab a healthy snack.
Got it.
I'm still tending to that urgent matter I was talking about earlier.
Which is what exactly?
Hmm, funny you should ask, you inquisitive litter ferret.
I've been practicing my dance moves.
If you wanna be with me Baby there's a price My dance troupe, Floorgasm, is performing tonight in the boooo-ty shake grand prix.
Gina, what the hell?
I defended you, and your urgent matter was just practicing for some stupid dance show?
Look, I can't help it if my life is literally a Step Up movie.
Oh, is it?
Then I suggest you think of this moment as the montage where you buckle down and take your job seriously so your boss doesn't kill you.
Fine, then I suggest you figure out how to turn on all these sprinklers 'cause I'm about to tell a story.
Okay, fingers wants us to meet him in that alley over there.
What's the playbook, Jakey?
Well, he left me that note in the bar to try and scare me.
But it only made me angry.
We go in hard and tough and take what's rightfully ours.
- I want $300.
- Absolutely, no problem.
Whatever you need.
I happen to not have any money on me though.
Charles, do you have any cash?
Um, I have $120, and my lucky $2 bill that I found on my first day of kindergarten.
Okay, so that's $122.
- And I want your shoes.
- What?
Fine.
Here.
Take my shoes.
Can I please have the watch now?
You already have it.
You had it all along.
What?
What are you talking about?
I put it in the glove compartment of your car.
Think I'm gonna walk around with a stolen police captain's watch?
I'm not an idiot.
Great.
Well, I would say thank you, but even for a criminal your customer service has been abysmal.
My pleasure.
Have a good night.
Let's get back to the precinct and win this bet.
Jake!
Jake, your car!
No!
Ow, glass.
No!
Ugh, syringe.
Jake, you parked in front of a hydrant.
Stupid fire department.
We gotta think of a way to catch up with that truck.
Oh!
How 'bout this?
- Yes.
- Hop in.
Go!
We're doing it, Boyle.
We're Tokyo drifting.
Gah, I can't see the tow truck anymore.
Charles, how come you're so much slower than a car?
I'm just trying not to jostle you too much.
You're the champagne of friends.
Look, there's a bar up ahead.
Maybe we can get a cab up there.
There's still time to get that watch.
All right.
Excuse me!
Excuse me.
Shoeless cop coming through.
Oh, God!
Charles!
Jake, where are you?
Come on!
Gah!
I was gonna wear this jacket to my cousin's bat mitzvah next week.
Hey!
Take it easy!
Get off of me!
Jake, party bus.
Toot!
Toot!
Get on board.
Good idea, Boyle.
Ugh, get off.
Ahh!
He's got my hand!
Aghhh!
Move!
NYPD.
I won't stop the party, but I do need the bus.
Let's dance, rawr.
All right.
What is happening here?
It's Halloween, man!
Lighten up, ha ha!
It's Halloween!
Halloween!
Well, gotta do something for 16 blocks.
Halloween!
Halloween!
Halloween!
Hey, I've been looking for you.
We need to talk.
Can we not do this right now, Terry?
I'm in the midst of a personal tragedy.
Oh, my God.
Is everything okay with your family?
Family, what?
No, this is serious.
Floorgasm just came by and danced me out of the group.
It's not fair.
I founded the group, and now they wanna kick me out just because I missed eight rehearsals in a row?
I never thought I'd say this, but Floorgasm has a point.
You're being super irresponsible.
You have a "baditude".
That's a bad attitude.
I love that.
Look, I didn't want you to know because it's so off-brand for me, but I'm missing rehearsals because I've been going to college at night.
I'm trying to finish my bachelor's degree or whatever.
Really?
That's great, Gina.
I'm so proud of you.
And while I generally nail everything, I'm just having trouble balancing my studies and my passion for dance.
Plus, you're working full-time.
Yeah, that actually doesn't factor into it whatsoever.
Anyway, it doesn't matter, because I'm never gonna dance again.
The world just lost an angel.
You know what?
I'm gonna dance with you tonight.
I'm not gonna let those losers punish you for doing something good.
School is cool.
That's why it rhymes.
Terry, you are the best!
World, your angel has returned.
Oh, God.
Thanks for the ride.
Tag me in those pics.
Ah, hi there.
I'm Jake Peralta, NYPD.
You guys towed my car, and I really need it back.
Mm-hmm.
Got a badge?
Yeah, I sure do.
What?
D'oh, my badge!
Those demons on the party bus must have stolen it.
If you got a license and credit card, just pay to get it out.
Oh, great.
Thank you.
Finally, something goes right.
It's gone horribly wrong!
I don't have my I.D. or my credit cards, but I really need that car.
Please, I'm begging you.
Rules are rules.
I can't do nothing for you.
Don't shut it.
Don't shut the window.
You got it.
Just gonna give up on this and head straight home without trying anything else.
Oh, look at the view from up here.
I didn't know we lived near water.
Ouch.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
Perfect.
Ah.
I can still win this bet.
I can still win.
No!
No!
Noooo!
Freeze!
Don't move!
Oh, my God.
There is a tiny chance I may not win this bet.
Talk now!
You seem upset.
Well, here's how the story goes.
Remember that little Halloween bet that we made?
You probably don't even remember, it was so early this morning.
Anywhoozle, it turns out the criminal I hired to lift your watch was not trustworthy, and I ended up contracting tuberculosis of the foot and subsequently losing your death watch.
But in the end, I like to think this whole thing is gonna bring us closer together.
And isn't that what it's really all about?
Merry Christmas!
What are you saying?
My watch is right here.
No, I made a switch.
That's a fake.
No.
This one's a fake.
What?
No.
What?
No.
What?
No.
You were behind all this?
You played me.
Like Frans Bruggen plays the flute.
But how?
I've been planning this this theft for three months.
I know, but I've been planning it for a year.
Last Halloween, after you won the bet, I went back to my office to do everyone's paperwork, but I did no paperwork.
I started to plot my revenge.
I began by creating a word cloud.
But how could you possibly have known I was gonna try and steal your watch?
I knew you would try to take something important to me.
During the year, I drew your attention to my watch.
You're eight minutes late.
You're 14 minutes late.
You're three minutes early In Chicago.
You annoyed me into stealing it.
Exactly.
Now you had a target, but you needed a plan.
Fortunately, it walked through the door, handcuffed to Diaz.
This scumbag pickpocket is Dan McCreary.
He can take anything off of anyone.
Anything?
Anyone?
The look on your face, priceless.
I put McCreary into my employ immediately.
Fast-forward to this morning.
You commenced your plan.
McCreary stole my watch, and then replaced it with the replica.
And while you celebrated, McCreary put my watch back in my pocket.
The watch never left my person.
Dun-dun-duh!
I can see that you're enjoying this.
Not nearly as much as I enjoyed phase two.
Phase two.
While you met with McCreary, Santiago placed a fire hydrant in front of your car, which she then towed away.
Next, I had to take Charles out of the equation.
He had a badge and a gun, and he would do anything to help you.
Enter a parade of drunks that separated the two of you long enough for Terry to kidnap Charles.
Then two bears spilled their drinks on you and stole your wallet.
Those bears?
Scully and Hitchcock.
I can't pull my head off!
If Terry kidnapped Charles, how did Charles tell me to get on the party bus?
Eight months ago at a morning briefing, I told the squad that a group of thieves was targeting party busses, so I could record Charles saying Jake, party bus!
Toot toot!
Get on board!
I knew Boyle would never knowingly betray me.
With your jacket and shoes gone, you didn't look like a cop, but you still had your badge.
That is, until you entered the party bus.
Rosa's feline dancing distracted you as a mysterious partier stole your badge on Halloween!
It was you in the mask!
You sly son of a bitch!
Well done.
But I do have to ask, those guys at the impound, did they really smash my car?
No, in fact, I had them wash it.
Good one, Captain.
You can't "wash a car".
So how'd you convince the whole squad to betray me?
What'd you offer them?
I asked them if they wanted to embarrass you, and they instantly said yes.
I'm not gonna lie, that turns me on a little bit.
Hmm.
So in addition to the five weeks of free overtime, I believe I'm owed one more thing.
Yes.
Here we go.
One second.
Very well.
- Captain Raymond Holt - Mm-hmm.
You are an amazing police captain/genius.
But be warned, I started planning next year's heist just this minute.
Good, then you're only three months behind.
You sick son of a bitch.
Hey.
Don't look so sad.
Floorgasm is just a rudderless dance ship without you.
I would have gone with "flock of dum-dums".
I talked to the captain.
We're all gonna pitch in and help you manage your time so you can pursue dance and school.
And I'd like to volunteer my time to tutor you for free.
Mm, a hard pass on that.
But I do wanna thank you guys for being so understanding and nice.
Now get your game face on.
Sarge, it's time to dance!
If you forget your moves, just rip your cape off and throw me up in the air like a pizza.
Put your hands together for the dance duo, Mr. and Mrs. Terry Jeffords.
I did not agree to that name!
Salt-n-Pepa's here And we're in effect Want you to push it, babe Coolin' by day, then at night Workin' up a sweat Ah, push it
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Whoo!
Extreme!
Oh, you guys are probably curious about this.
It's no biggie.
My car's in the shop, so I rode in on Rosa's motorcycle.
I guess you could say I'm a gear head now.
He held on to me so tight, it was like a two-mile Heimlich.
Those things have no walls on them.
Captain, why are you sitting at my desk?
Lieutenant Miller from Internal Affairs is here.
He's taken over my office.
Apparently, someone has been leaking classified information to a criminal syndicate.
The entire squad is under investigation.
That's crazy.
No one here's a mole.
How can you be so sure?
Because I know these guys.
I know everything about them.
Well, you're a poor police officer if you don't think people can surprise you.
Not these people.
Here, watch this.
I know what everyone's gonna do tonight.
It's Thursday, so Gina's gonna leave early to rehearse with her new dance group, Dancy Reagan.
There the first ladies of movement.
Amy's gonna be going over her weekly budget.
And Charles will be attending a "pizza for one" cooking class.
Tonight's menu: Pepper-alone-I.
And if I run and leap at Terry, he will most certainly catch me in his arms.
- Coming in!
- No!
I'm holding coffee!
Hey, I'm about to sit down with Internal Affairs.
I figure that I will charm them with a couple of quips about my own "Internal Affairs".
Talking about my tum-tum.
Please don't joke around in there.
I know you're used to riffing with me, but Internal Affairs detectives rarely have my sense of humor.
Wow, you are really worried about this investigation.
Okay, fine.
I promise I will be stone-cold serious in my interview.
I'll even use my serious face.
If you're wondering how I'm pulling this off, I'm thinking about the time when I was eight and Don Mattingly called me a little turd.
- Was he right?
- Yes.
Hey there.
Jake Peralta.
I'm sorry, handshakes are the greatest avenues of germ transmission.
I generally prefer simple nods.
Okay.
Would you, uh, pass me that hand sanitizer, please?
Yeah.
No, no, no!
Use your elbows.
And keep your nostrils closed.
Don't breathe on it.
Ah!
Forget it, I'll just use a wipe.
Smart.
Get off, damn germs.
So what information has been leaked and by who?
You don't need to know that.
All you need to know is that a felony has been committed by someone on your squad, and I'm gonna find out who did it.
Now have you ever taken confidential information about an ongoing investigation out of this precinct?
No.
I would never do something that stupid.
I did something really stupid.
I need your help.
You know how I'm kind of a sexy bad boy who rides motorcycles into work and is always breaking the rules in the name of justice?
I don't like where this is going.
Well, I also maybe sometimes bring home case files to work on them after hours, and I might not be that great about returning them.
Oh, God.
Are you aroused because of what a bad boy I am?
- No!
- No!
You could be suspended for that.
He could think you're the mole!
Not so loud.
Yes, Amy, I do drink from the bowl definitely pulled that off.
Look, I need to get those files.
Can you please give me a ride?
Fine.
I'll get my stuff, but this better not bite me in the ass.
Better not bite me in the ass is the name of your sex tape.
But seriously, thank you so much for your help.
Peralta.
How'd it go with Miller?
Fantastic, he loved me.
I would give you more details, but someone just came in to try and find her dalmatian coat.
Hello, Raymond.
Madeline.
I wondered why all the birds had suddenly stopped singing.
What brings you here?
I heard you were under investigation by Internal Affairs.
Didn't wanna miss that.
So much time with your ear to the pavement.
It's a pity a truck hasn't run over your head.
Very visual.
When, oh when, will you quit police work and pursue your dream of poetry?
I'm looking for detective Scully.
You must be from I.A.B. I'm deputy chief Wuntch.
Nice to meet you.
If you have a minute, I'd love a detailed report of this investigation.
I.A.B. exists outside of department hierarchy.
I don't answer to you.
Detective Scully, you're up.
Oh, uh, okay Um No.
You know what?
We'll do this over the phone.
Oh, Raymond.
An Internal Affairs investigation?
A drug task force that hasn't found any drugs?
This precinct's a disaster.
Maybe that's why the birds stopped singing.
Out of respect for the death of your career.
Good-bye, Raymond.
Detective Diaz.
Can you give me even a shred of good news about your drug task force?
The good news is I can be brief about it.
We have nothing.
Sorry.
I had to talk my twins into getting their hair done.
There are some promises involving lollipops I do not intend to keep.
The task force has made some busts.
But we still haven't found any high-level dealers or major drug stashes.
But we will soon.
Is that a promise?
Or just another lollipop that no one's ever gonna lick?
Wuntch is waiting for this task force to fail.
I need tangible results.
Sarge and I are going undercover at electric library.
It's a silent disco.
Everyone wear headphones.
It's actually very respectful to the neighbors except for the lewd acts and vomiting.
There's usually some ecstasy at these things.
So hopefully, we'll find some giggle pig.
Great.
I hope there's a lot of drug activity there.
Of course, ideally, there will be nobody taking drugs there or anywhere else in the district.
But if drugs must be found, let it be there.
Please, God, let it be there.
Trunk!
All right, that's it.
One box of files and one box of powdered donuts from under my bed.
Oh, cool.
Can I see those?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Oh, no, no, no!
This is a new car.
I won't have you Jake it up - with donut powder.
- Ah I hate to say it, but we still need to make one more stop.
There's still some files at my old place.
A.K.A. Gina's apartment.
Ugh, fine.
I'll call her.
Wow, there's so many fancy buttons on your steering wheel.
It's like a spy car, that's cool.
Here, let me call her.
Yeah.
Car, call Gina Linetti.
What is that voice?
It's my spy voice.
Car, initiate ghost mode.
That's a seat warmer.
Oh, that's even better than rockets.
My butt gets very cold.
It's Gina's phone.
Leave me a voice-mail.
I won't check it 'cause it's not 1993.
We should go there anyways.
Her phone's probably off 'cause of dance rehearsal.
God, this I.A.B. guy is ruining my life.
But I do have some good news in three, two Pocket donut!
No!
It's everywhere.
Backup.
Gina, open up.
Well, luckily, I still have a key from when I lived here.
- Mm.
- Ah!
Here we go.
Oh, my God!
Oh, God!
What is going on?
Gina and I are casual lovers.
Ew.
How long has this been going on?
We hooked up once, last summer and then the nightmare started again about a month ago.
Ever since then, it's been orgasm-city.
Ew!
Yuck, gross.
Right, guys?
Wait a minute.
You lied to me?
There was no "pizza for one" cooking class tonight.
You've been lying to me for weeks!
Oh, I can't tonight.
I'm teaching inner city kids to make candles.
Oh, sorry.
I'm going to a prenatal yoga class.
No can do, going to my adult tumbling class.
Yes, Jake, those were lies.
But the way you looked at me when you thought I was a gymnast made me wish it were true.
You came into work with chalk on your hands, Boyle.
I don't even know you anymore.
I'm leaving.
I just gotta get some old case files first.
Don't be mad, Jake.
You still know me.
I'm still Charles.
I just have four extra sex moves.
Five forgot about "boy on top".
Ugh.
Terry!
Terry.
I can't believe they call this a "silent disco".
This is not a disco.
And I should know.
I was raised on disco.
Little Terry loved the hustle.
Excuse me, can I get a bottle of water?
Good move.
Giggle dehydrates the hell out of you.
Yeah, I don't do that stuff.
I don't even drink.
Hey, your shirt.
My daughters go to the learning grove.
Did you get that from a vintage store or something?
No, I went there.
I was in the dolphins class.
And you don't do drugs or drink.
Have a water on the house.
- Well, she was useless.
- Not entirely.
I learned that my babies are on the right track because their pre-school turns out nice kids.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Holt that at the task force meeting.
Now let's go look for some bad kids who went to sub-par pre-schools.
That was insane.
I mean, who else is hooking up that we don't know about?
Rosa and Terry?
Holt and Scully?
You and Hitchcock?
You need to forget about Charles, okay?
You need to get inside and put those files back.
Wait, wait, wait.
Why'd I get Hitchcock?
Because you're the girl version of him.
Thanks again for all your help.
- Okay, bye.
- Wha Hey, captain.
Mind if we sit?
Is everything okay?
Nothing's okay.
Wuntch Circling me like a shark frenzied by chum.
The task force, turning into a career-threatening quagmire.
An Internal Affairs investigation casting doubt upon my integrity.
And you ask, "is everything okay"?
I am buffeted by the winds of my foes' enmity and cast about by the towering waves of cruel fate.
Yet I, a captain, am no longer able to command my vessel, my precinct, from my customary helm, my office.
And you ask, "is everything okay"?
I've worked the better part of my years on earth overcoming every prejudice and fighting for the position I hold.
And now I feel it being ripped from my grasp.
And with it The very essence of what defines me as a man.
And you ask, "is everything okay"?
Yeah, I hear you.
My dog has taken over my favorite chair.
It's like, how did it all slip away?
Gentlemen.
Damn it, Charles.
This is a crisis.
Step one: Termination.
You and I will never touch again.
Damn!
If I'd known it was our last time, I would've moaned more.
Step two: Containment.
We need to make sure that no one else finds out.
Yeah, Jake won't tell anyone if I ask him not to.
I'll handle him.
You take care of Amy.
But how to make it look like an accident?
I'm not saying murder.
Just talk to her like a normal person.
Right, even better, get her to tell me all her little secrets then if she tries anything Uhh we can destroy her.
Hello, Peralta.
Oh, my God!
Hi.
What's going on here?
Funny story.
I took these files home a while ago, even though I shouldn't have.
And now, I'm bringing them back.
Isn't that funny?
Are you laughing behind the mask?
No.
Kev!
Jake, it's after midnight.
This had better be about a murder.
No, I wish.
Look, I'm really sorry, but I have to talk to captain Holt.
Raymond, your work life is here.
Please, come in.
Take off your shoes.
Neither of us want that.
What is going on, Peralta?
This has been a long day.
Well, I.A.B. caught me returning some classified files, and I am now the prime suspect in the mole investigation, and Miller said I would be suspended in the morning.
But more importantly, what does the "J" stand for?
James?
John?
Jo-Jo?
My middle name is more important to you than being suspended?
If it's Jo-Jo?
Yes.
Look, I came here because we have to figure this thing out.
Miller is sure there's a mole in the precinct, and the only way to prove it's not me is to figure out who it is.
You said there was no mole.
You said you knew everything about these people.
Well, it turns out I don't.
I've learned some truly horrible things tonight.
You were right, and I was wrong.
Goodness.
Boyle is sleeping with Gina?
What?
How could you possibly know that?
"You were right and I was wrong".
You must have been shaken to your core to say that to me.
Boyle is your most trusted friend, so he has to be involved.
Your use of the word "horrible" leads me to believe that the matter was sexual in nature, given your obvious immaturity.
Pfft.
I've had sex.
And, of course, you would be most upset if Boyle were to have slept with someone you knew from your childhood.
Thus, the solve: Gina and Charles.
That was amazing.
Come into my study.
Let's figure out who that mole is.
I took all the giggle I had.
There might be some left in my mouth if you wanna make out.
That sounds amazing.
I'd love to make out with you once I'm super high.
Where can I get some?
That girl over there sold it to me.
What happened, Ava?
I thought you said you didn't drink or do drugs.
I don't.
Do you know how much math is involved in dealing drugs?
You gotta keep a clear head.
Look, this doesn't have to be a big deal.
Just give us the name of your supplier.
How'd you get involved in dealing giggle?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We gotta back this up.
After pre-school, did you go to private or public elementary?
Private.
- When were you potty-trained?
- That's so random.
Sarge, the giggle pig.
All right, let's go through the squad one by one.
Rosa's very secretive.
I don't know anything about her personal life.
Charles has expensive tastes.
Gina has said many times that she would sell us all out for five minutes with Blake Griffin.
Let's see, Terry wants to send his twins to private school.
But on his salary, that's difficult.
- Mm - Plus with twins, one of them's always evil, so It's Cagney.
Gina, is everything okay?
You never text me.
Look, the last message I got from you was august 3rd, 2009.
You wrote, "sup, Rosa"?
Followed by, "never mind".
It's over between me and Charles.
I'm so upset.
Amy, when will I ever find a relationship as perfect as the one you have with Freddy?
It's Teddy, and it's not perfect.
Believe me.
All his underwear are lined with mesh like a bathing suit.
Is it medical?
How do you even ask that?
I don't know, but keep talking.
What else, what else, what else?
Wait a minute.
One time, I saw Rosa eating watermelon.
But then, when I asked her about it, she said she'd never eaten that or any other kind of melon.
Now that I say it out loud, it doesn't seem like much.
No.
Put it on the board!
Oh!
Hey, check it out.
Dog bra.
Dog bra.
Oh, I'm so tired.
I can't keep my eyes open.
Here I need you to slap me.
I'm not gonna do that, Peralta.
- Oh!
- I thought perhaps the element of surprise would help.
It did!
I can't believe we can't figure out who the mole is.
Well, there is someone we haven't talked about yet.
Detective Jake Peralta.
What?
Someone's got a case of the sleepover jokies.
Why would I be the mole?
You were just caught sneaking classified material into the precinct.
You spent six months undercover in the mafia and have many criminal contacts.
You've been known to flaunt departmental rules and regulations, and you are deeply in debt.
Well, if you hadn't tricked me into getting car insurance, I wouldn't be in debt.
You wanna do me?
I'll do you right back.
Tit for toot.
I've been on the force for 30 years, and I've never been accused of impropriety.
Oh, is that a fact?
Because I heard you call deputy chief Wuntch by her first name and after that, you told her you hoped she got carried off by crows.
That is gross insubordination.
Madeline is irrelevant.
Our battles extend beyond the confines of NYPD rules.
You're being ridiculous.
Am I?
If you're such a great cop, how come you didn't know there was a mole in your precinct?
That's right Because you did.
Because you are the mole, you mole!
I've heard enough!
Please return your guest pajamas, guest toothbrush, and guest slippers, and get out of here.
It's time for you to be suspended.
Peralta, shouldn't you be suspended by now?
Yes, and I know that you're mad that I'm here, but you're about to get over it, because I know who the mole is.
Lieutenant Miller.
I don't think he's with I.A.B. at all.
I think he's spying for Wuntch.
- Wuntch?
- You said it yourself.
Your battles extend beyond the confines of NYPD rules.
She wants information about your task force, but she can't get access, so she sent in a spy.
That's why Miller was skulking around the file room when I was supposed to be the only skulker.
That's interesting.
I did notice something odd when he and Wuntch first met.
She just nodded at him.
She didn't even try to shake his hand.
She already knew he was a germaphobe because they'd met before.
Yes.
Unfortunately, we don't have any hard proof that they're working together.
Well, lucky for you, proof is my middle name.
And yours is Jared.
Juice box.
Jellyfish.
Jamiroquai!
Lieutenant Miller.
What do you want, Peralta?
I wanna play ball.
Clear my name, and I'll give you information about captain Holt.
Well, I'm interested.
What kind of information?
It's all on this.
Pretty dope drive, right?
It's a USB shaped like a gun.
Boink!
All right, I'll give it to my superiors and I'll be in contact.
Hey, I know you only wanted to hang out last night so you could find out dirt on me.
What?
Uh-uh.
Look, you don't have to be worried.
I'll never tell anyone about you and Charles.
But honestly, it's not as embarrassing as you think.
It was shocking, but then I got over it, and it seemed normal.
Except for seeing how hairless Charles' legs are.
I mean, does he shave them?
No, he wears really cheap pants and as far as I can tell, he's been chafed smooth.
Yikes.
Imagine that wrapped around you.
Okay.
Okay.
I could get in a lot of trouble for this.
But the big secret about captain Holt is That I have a flair for the dramatic.
Look behind you, Madeline.
We're actually in front of you.
That's my fault I thought the layout was gonna be different.
I didn't know how you guys were gonna be sitting.
I took a chance.
Miller may be in Internal Affairs, but he wasn't here on official business.
You sent him to spy on us.
That's a flagrant ethics violation, Madeline.
And it could sink you.
Fine, you're right.
But you can't prove that.
It's just your word against mine.
Ooh, actually, it's your word against you.
Pardon me.
I put a recording device in this dope drive, so I got your whole conversation.
You're going to leave my precinct and my task force alone.
Or else You're Wuntch meat.
You sure you wanna go with that one?
Absolutely.
It's hilarious.
All right.
Hey.
I'm sorry about last night.
I let my personal stuff affect the job.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
This morning, I did some real police work.
I called the learning grove.
They never had an "Ava Watson," so I faxed them a picture.
They identified her as Rebecca Lubbock.
I pulled her phone records and I think we have some good leads on a possible supplier.
Wow, nice work.
And hey, you should never worry about your kids.
You're the best dad I know.
Cagney and Lacey are gonna grow up great.
- You think so?
- 100%.
You're right.
They're gonna be twin presidents.
They'll either run as one person and trick everyone, or they'll as two and serve for It's a damned Dynasty.
Excuse me, I have an announcement to make.
Can I have everyone's attention, please.
Charles Boyle and I had sex.
What the hell?
Gina, what are you doing?
Amy was right.
People will be shocked, and then they'll get over it and we can move on.
At least this way, I get to control how it gets out.
I'm about to Olivia pope this sitch.
First off, I would like to remind you all about several notable men from my past.
The rock-climbing backpacker, the underwear model, the guy who looked like Tywin Lannister.
I bring these men to mind so you can appreciate this dalliance for what it was An outlier.
I will now take questions.
How was the sex?
Gross.
The sex was gross, or I'm gross?
You're gross.
The sex was adequate.
How many times did you do it?
Don't ask, can't explain.
I have a question.
Do you have any regrets?
No.
It was pretty fun.
Thank you so much for coming out today.
Hey, I should've said this last night, but your first casual relationship nice work!
I know!
I didn't even propose to her once.
Jake, I'm so sorry I lied to you.
I mean, I wanted to tell you so badly.
But I promised Gina I wouldn't tell anyone.
You kept a promise to a friend.
That sounds like the Charles I know.
Just like I know everyone here.
Yes, you do.
Although, there is something you didn't know about me.
My middle name Is Jacob.
What?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Wait for it Wait for it 9:01!
Amy Santiago is officially late for the first time ever.
All right, let's do this.
Who's got theories?
Uh Alarm didn't go off.
All three alarms?
All with battery back-up?
Come on, who wants to take this seriously?
Ooh!
She was taken in her sleep!
That's what I'm talking about!
Super dark, Boyle, but way more plausible than the sarge's idiotic alarm clock theory.
I bet she tucked herself into bed too tight and got stuck.
Mm, maybe she Fell into another dimension where she's interesting.
It's 9:00 A.M. why is no one working?
Amy Santiago is a few minutes late, and we're all trying to guess why.
I'd like to play.
I'd say she's in line at the bank.
- This is fun.
- It is fun, but you're all wrong.
She clearly slipped through a subway grate and is having terrible sex with a mole man.
There she is.
Amy.
Where have you been?
We've been worried sick.
Do you care to explain yourself?
I'm just 70 seconds late.
It's not a big deal.
Don't worry about it.
Santiago, you will tell us, and you will tell us now.
There was a problem at the bank.
Hot damn!
So you nervous about the trial tomorrow?
The jewelry store break-in?
Diamond heist.
It's like you're going out of your way to make it sound less cool.
I think the conviction's a slam dunk.
Good.
Not to over state it, but I'm definitely gonna die alone, and work is all I have.
I take it dating's not going well.
What?
No!
It's awesome.
What happened with Rosa's friend, Katie?
Yeah, she turned out to be even more closed off than Rosa.
So how long have you known Rosa?
None of your business.
All right.
But it's not just her.
All the dates I've been on lately have been lame.
Maybe it's you.
What are your moves?
What do you talk about?
Uh, my moves are fine, mom.
I dazzle them with a bad-ass cop story.
Have you ever thought about going with your non-work interests?
On my first date with my wife, all we did was talk about our mutual love of meat loaf.
The singer, not the food.
Oh, so the weirder of the two choices.
All right, fine.
I get what you're saying.
Your wife's awesome and I should do everything in my power to be with her physically.
I mean, no, not that.
Don't talk about being a cop.
Just talk about my own interests.
Exactly!
Hey, she's cute.
And alone.
I'll try and find our meatloaf.
Go get her, little man.
Hello there.
Hi!
Captain We need to talk about the union rep elections.
Scully is running again, unopposed.
He is incompetent.
If there's one thing to take away from the new contract, it's that holiday pay is "now capped".
Or "not capped".
In conclusion, the word "capped" was said.
Whoo!
Nailed it.
The only reason Scully does the job is because the annual union meeting has a party sub.
He's been a rep for 12 years, and he still pronounces "union" as "onion".
As management, I'm not allowed to talk about union matters.
Scully doesn't know anything about our pensions and he has no idea about the new disciplinary guidelines.
What do you think, captain?
What I think is, I will continue to not talk about this issue.
Hey, you should run.
Going to meetings, writing stuff down.
You love that nerd stuff.
"Writing things down" is nerdy?
What do you do?
I just forget stuff like a cool person.
Come on, admit it, you care about this crap.
Maybe.
But I want to be captain one day, and union reps are always fighting with the brass.
It's career suicide, right, sir?
Stop trying to get me involved, Santiago.
No!
I'm already fighting with the brass.
Look at what you've done!
Oh man, these look spicy!
We may die tonight.
You know, I actually heard about a guy - who died while eating hot wings.
- Really?
Yeah, he was terminally ill beforehand though.
Unrelated.
I always thought I'd die at the hands of my own clone.
Well, that's why you have to brand the number two into your clone's cheek.
You shouldn't have a clone if you don't know that.
Yes.
All right, you ready?
I'm ready.
Here we go.
- That's nothing.
- Amateur night.
I can't believe this had three peppers next to it on the menu - Oh, my God!
- Ah!
- Hot!
- Oh, so spicy!
Drink the ranch!
Drink the ranch!
Ah!
Ah!
Here's the stuff you left at my place.
Your sounds of Ibiza sleep cd, seven phone chargers, and an empty jar labeled "fire spirit".
No, it's not empty.
Well, here's your stuff.
So I guess it's officially over.
It was slightly less gross than I expected.
Mm.
Way to be.
Uh, there is one last thing.
The luxury sex romp we had planned this weekend.
The hotel says the "bubbles and bathrobes" package is non-refundable.
See, that's why I didn't want to pre-pay, Charles.
Yeah, but that's why we got such a good deal.
One hour of free Wi-Fi!
Don't worry, you can have your half of the money back, and I'll take the room.
Pause.
Okay, if one of us is getting pampered all night, it's gonna be me.
I want that room, Gina.
You can't push me around.
We're not poke pals anymore!
Ew!
Amy Santiago, surprised to see you walking around.
Shouldn't you be on your belly, you snake?
Yeah, you snake!
What is happening?
You're running against me.
What?
Rosa must've done this.
I'll get her to stop.
You know what really burns my pants?
I considered you my best friend.
- What?
- What?
- Hi.
- Hey now.
You are looking very happy.
I am.
Guess what happened last night.
Spoiler alert: Sexy-times.
Okay, now guess.
Sexy-times!
Yes!
The whole night was amazing.
We totally hit it off.
I found our meat loaf.
Wings.
The band or the show?
The food!
We went back to her place, watched die hards one through with a vengeance, did some adult stuff, and spent the rest of the night debating who's the better ping-pong player.
She was adorably wrong.
How do you know if you didn't play?
Oh, we played, which was difficult since she didn't have a table or paddles.
We had to use an avocado pit as the ball.
It was very messy.
Hey guys.
Ah, hello, district attorney kurm.
I got lucky last night.
That's great.
Yeah.
So we have a little delay.
Gary, the defense attorney, isn't gonna be here.
Oh, is he sore from high-fiving criminals he's gotten out of jail?
Did he get a murderer off who then murdered him to celebrate?
Yup.
Anyway, Gary broke his leg, so he's being replaced.
Replaced?
He should be put down.
Like a horse.
So who's the new sub-human piece of human garbage?
Sophia Perez.
Oh, God.
Jake, this is bad!
You slept with a defense attorney.
You literally slept with the enemy.
I know.
Ah, it's like if John McClane slept with Hans Gruber.
Or even worse, Jeremy Irons from the third one.
We didn't talk about our jobs.
How was I supposed to know?
Wait, are you sure you want to do this?
Let's go over the events of tonight.
We got drunk together, I invited you up to my apartment, and I kissed you first.
No further questions.
Okay.
Uh-oh.
She's waving at you.
Hey.
All right, I'm gonna go talk to her.
Be strong.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, so this is weird, huh?
Yeah.
You never told me you were a cop.
Yeah, and you never told me you were a lawyer.
Well, I didn't wanna intimidate you.
Intimidate?
Wow.
Okay, well, not to burst your bubble, but I'm only intimidated by professions that have a moral compass, like police officer.
So you're intimidated by your own job?
"Oh, look at me.
I'm a lawyer.
I'm so good at word-using-itude".
And yes, I know that that wasn't a word, right.
Okay, you know what?
I can't even believe I have to deal with you all week.
Not a problem.
This is clearly a conflict of interest.
So I'm just gonna talk to the judge and have you kicked off the case.
Ha ha!
No, there's no conflict of interest.
Because I'm not interested in you.
Ah.
God, I can't believe I slept with a cop.
It's like a had sex with Hans Gruber.
What I'm not the Gruber!
You're the Gruber!
Die Hard.
Captain, Rosa's trying to make me run for union rep.
You have to stop her.
I cannot do that.
As I told you, I'm not allowed to get involved.
It's too late anyway.
You already have a campaign slogan.
"Pick Amy, dummies".
I wrote that.
Tell her how good it is, captain.
Again, I cannot.
Look, I love campaigning and making signs.
Lord knows I have enough poster board at home.
But captain, please tell her I shouldn't run for union rep.
I'm just gonna turn around in my chair.
So, Amy, you're saying I should just return this Button maker?
You think you can tempt me with a T150 button maker?
Sir, you've gotta see this.
It doesn't even make mirror-backs.
This is a joke.
Still not participating.
I'm enjoying a magazine.
Joke's on you, Amy.
You and Scully are giving campaign speeches in the briefing room tomorrow.
What?
Sir, permission to arrest Diaz for being a jerk.
Permission to shoot Santiago for being a coward.
Stop it, both of you.
Now you've done it.
You've made me turn my chair.
I will not get involved, and I will not have this office transformed into a house of snipes and jabs.
Dismissed.
Full disclosure, your honor.
Last night, miss Perez and I got inebriated, and we had colitis.
Colitis?
Coitus.
Yeah, that.
A cop and a defense attorney sleeping together.
That's highly unusual.
At the time, I did not know she was a defense attorney.
I should have been able to guess, however, based on her ability to lie all over me.
Ha ha a cop's attempt to be clever.
It's like watching a horse try to eat with a fork.
Majestic and hilarious?
Take a cold shower, horn-dog, we're at work.
But in all seriousness, your honor, I do think she should recuse herself from the trial.
Why?
You think I might tell everybody in the courtroom that you like to be the little spoon?
Everyone likes to be the little spoon.
It makes you feel safe!
Carl, back me up on this.
- Yes, little spoon all the way.
- See?
Look, I'm not recusing myself.
I talked to my client, and he is fine with me staying on.
If the defendant is okay with it, and you two can be mature in the courtroom, then I see no reason why we can't proceed.
Great.
I can be mature.
Says the guy who uses a sunglasses case as a wallet.
Stuff can be two things.
Open up your refrigerator, boom!
Air conditioner.
Life hacked.
Carl, back me up.
I mean, it's not very green.
Oh, Carl.
Guys!
Guys, guys, guys, guys!
My pizza reviews caught the eye of a Mr. Matt Pittle of Pittle's vittles, my favorite food blog!
Wow, a local food blog.
It's all happening.
Pittle wants to have a five- hour dinner with me tonight.
Attention, skeezy nobodies!
Tina Knowles, Beyonce's mom-ager, has contacted me and wants to audition me tonight.
I've transcended you now.
Sounds like both of you have pretty great plans tonight.
No!
You wrote the email from Pittle so I'd drop my claim to the room.
That blog is sacred.
You defiled the most sacred and most high miss Tina Kno-w-les!
How dare you, Charles?
How'd you get your voice so high?
I can take it higher.
I wish you wouldn't.
The room is mine, you scab.
No, it's mine, Gina.
I'm not backing down this time.
I'm backing up.
Beep, beep, beep.
You nervous?
Nope.
I have an unimpeachable eyewitness who saw everything.
Plus, I've got a little something planned for our lawyer friend.
Every time she looks over, I'm gonna hit her with one of these.
It'll remind her that we kissed, and that's how I get in her head.
I like it.
You want me to flex and make all the buttons pop off of my shirt?
Yes!
You can do that?
The challenge is keeping the buttons on.
Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
And you're sure this is the man you saw leaving the store at the time of the diamond heist?
Nice.
"Diamond heist," catching on.
Uh, yeah.
That's the guy.
Now, Mr. Wells, it says here you have a 2006 conviction for perjury, is that correct?
Uh yeah.
It's okay.
I knew about that.
And is Sidney Wells actually your name, or is it Brian Davidson?
Uh-oh.
Did not know about that one.
As in the Brian Davidson who is facing fraud charges - in New Jersey?
- Yeah.
Or that.
Oh, God okay, time to bust out the big guns.
This is bad.
Only the judge saw me.
No further questions, your honor.
Ugh, winking?
Real mature.
Judge gave us a recess, but if we don't get new evidence by tomorrow, we have no chance.
Great pep talk, Carl.
Don't worry, we'll get some evidence.
Excuse me one second.
Hey, that wasn't cool.
No.
What wasn't cool was you trying to air make-out with the judge.
Those kisses were meant for you!
Not in a romantic way, they were psych-out kisses.
Look, you know your client did it.
It doesn't matter if my client did it or not.
That's what I've been saying.
It doesn't matter.
All right, Scott, beat it.
Scott.
Look, my job is to make you prove he did it.
It's the basis of our entire justice system.
What, you think John Adams was just some idiot?
No, I think John Adams was a mini-series I didn't watch because it looked like a book.
Look, without a credible witness, your case is a mess.
Kinda like your ping-pong serve.
Oh, my God.
She smells so good.
That avocado pit was not regulation.
Wish that had sounded cooler.
Come on, Terry, let's go save the day.
Carl, you wanna come?
- No, thank you.
- All right.
All right, listen up.
We need more evidence on this guy and we need it quick, so no time for chit-chat.
What's going on?
You love chit-chat.
Yeah, also, your posture seems off, like, it's good.
Because I'm being serious because I don't want this perp to walk.
This isn't about the perp.
It's about this woman.
Jake slept with her.
Oh, she's so pretty.
She looks like the woman on an olive oil bottle.
Way to go, Jake.
She's a defense attorney.
- Oh, my God, are you kidding?
- Boo!
Hey, guys, let's take it easy on him.
Thank you, Terry.
But seriously, I think you need to get checked for rabies.
Hey, I have a good rabies guy, if you need one.
Uh-huh.
All right, listen.
Can we focus up?
Our witness is useless, so we either need to recover the stolen gems or find the break-in tool.
What year was the perp's house built in?
Some of those old brownstones had dumbwaiters.
A perfect hiding spot.
Good thinking, Amy.
All right, I'm gonna win this case and then we can put my horrible sexual experience - behind us forever.
- I don't know Jake.
I'm afraid I'm gonna think about it every time I look at your crotch.
Then stop looking at my crotch!
What are you doing?
Just pointing people to the one Detective who actually wants to run for union rep.
Welcome to my nightmares, Amy-Scully minotaur.
Pretty clever signing me up for the speech this afternoon.
But guess what?
Mine is epically bad and way too long.
There's a section where I just pick people out of the crowd and insult them.
It gets really personal.
Did you know that Hitchcock is technically "a bastard"?
Santiago, can I talk to you in my office?
Mm-hmm.
Blinds closed?
Are we having a pow-wow?
As you know, I shouldn't be talking about this election with any of my detectives, but I will with you.
Of course.
Because you trust me.
Because you're royally screwing up.
Oh, no, this isn't a pow-wow.
It's a haranguing.
You bet it is.
Stop trying to tank this election.
You know damned well you'd make a great union rep.
But, sir, I want to be captain one day, and clashing with the brass is career suicide.
Not for me.
By my very nature, I was constantly in conflict with my superiors.
Listen, you're black and gay, so I think you should just take all the black, gay cases.
You know, the weird stuff.
I strongly disagree.
But I still managed to rise through the ranks.
Run for union rep, Amy.
Okay.
I'll do it.
But never tell anyone about this Pow-wow.
You called it a pow-wow!
So, Detective Peralta, you found some "new" evidence last night.
Coorection: I found some damning new evidence last night.
It was hidden in an old dumbwaiter in the defendant's house.
All his burglary tools, including a glass cutter he used to break into the store.
Yes, but isn't it possible my client could've used the glass cutter for something other than a robbery?
I mean, after all, stuff can do two things, right?
Hey!
I say that!
That's my saying!
Your honor, she stole my saying.
People don't own sayings.
Please answer the question, Detective.
Fine.
In the same bag as the burglary tools, we also found shards of glass.
And you expect us to believe that you found this new evidence yesterday just as your case was collapsing around you?
I certainly hope so, because it's the truth.
In fact, I believe it was the great John Adams who once said, "to believe all men honest is folly.
To believe none Is something worse".
Let the record show miss Perez looks stunned and defeated.
No further questions.
- You're not allowed to say that.
- Yup.
Hey, captain, I have a juicy little Boyle nugget I'd like to drop on you.
Okay, please drop a nugget.
I think that the squad could really increase its efficiency if Gina spent the night re-logging all our files with keywords.
The lady doth have the skills.
Funny, she was just telling me how you should work all night.
Say what?
Gina.
Yes?
You've both made compelling points about the amount of work that needs to be done around here, so you'll both be pulling overnight shifts.
Before you complain, I am once again turning in my chair.
Oh, sweet chair turn.
That's a real power move.
So good.
We, the jury, find the defendant - Not guilty.
- Oh, come on!
Ow!
Oh, I'm in too much pain to care how cool and strong that made me look.
It was already splintering.
Don't take this away from me.
Wow, well done.
Another criminal walks free.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
Maybe stop calling my client a criminal, since he was found not guilty.
Well, I find myself not guilty of never seeing you again.
So you will see me again?
No!
Why, what did I say?
You know what?
You're the worst!
Jake, what are you doing, man?
Walking angrily away towards a door that I now see says "emergency exit only" on it, so I'm turning around, but I'm still ticked!
Look, man.
Don't screw this up.
I hate defense attorneys as much as any rational adult, but you obviously have feelings for Sophia.
Yeah, anger.
I don't know.
It just seems to me like you met your match.
You said yourself how boring your dates have been.
But you have to admit, Sophia wouldn't be boring.
I will admit she's not boring.
And we do have fun together.
I guess you could say she's passably attractive.
All right, fine.
She's super hot.
God, I can't believe I'm about to ask out a defense attorney.
And we all know that Amy Santiago wants to be captain one day, which means she will never stand up to management.
I don't want to be captain.
I just want my party sub.
Please just give me back my sub.
Vote Scully.
I'm gonna make this quick.
Scully said that I want to be captain, and I do.
But that won't stop me from standing up for you.
He also said if you voted for him, you'd get a golden boat.
That's not real.
If I get elected, I'll go to all the union meetings, actually pay attention, and most importantly, I'll bring back party sub leftovers.
Thank you, Scully.
"Pick Amy, dummies".
Hello.
Hey.
How'd you find me?
I'm a Detective, remember?
I also went into a bunch of wrong offices first.
Stole hella peppermints.
So what's up?
You here to yell at me again for doing my job?
No, I'm here to ask you out.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
There's a bar in the West Village that has a bunch of ping-pong tables, so I thought we could head over there and have a drink, talk, and then, with any luck, things will get uncomfortably competitive.
That sounds fun.
Look, if we're going to do this, we're gonna have to have a couple of rules.
Rule number one, starting right now: No work talk.
Perfect, we can just skip straight to making out on your desk.
Yeah, that's not my desk.
This is.
Copy that.
Blame it on the janitor and make a break for it?
- Absolutely.
- After you.
Charles, I'm sorry that neither of us have the room.
Yes.
I, too, am disappointed by this unfortunate stalemate.
Why are you talking all victorian?
You're lying about something.
That's what that means.
Nonsense, m'lady.
Okay, fine I might not be in that hotel room right now, but my gene pool is.
Ew.
What'd you do in there?
I gave the hotel room to my father and told him to check in under my name.
What?
No!
I gave my key to my mom!
Hey.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I must have the wrong room.
That's okay.
Hey, wait a second, do we know each other?
Is your daughter Gina?
Yes!
And you're that little man's father, Boyle.
Yeah.
We met at the family food drive.
I'm Darlene Linetti.
Lynn Boyle, pleased to re-meet you.
So what do you think's going on here?
Mix up or something?
I don't know.
Regina's been encouraging me to have some Romantic adventures.
Holy cow.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Morning.
Who are those for?
Captain Holt's uncle passed away.
They weren't close, but I wanted to do something.
Interesting.
Flowers are a bold choice, Santiago, but I can still beat you.
Beat me at expressing condolences?
Yup, it's on.
Flowers are a gift, and Captain Holt hates gifts.
I think a thoughtful email is the way to go here.
"Dear Captain, we were all so sorry for your loss".
Group sentiment, very meaningful.
"Please let us know if there's anything we can do".
Selfless act.
Very respectful.
Correct, I am the King of respectfulness, bitches!
Hey, did you send that from your personal or work account?
Personal It's a personal matter involving a personal friend and his personal uncle.
So you remembered to turn off your signature, right?
Oh, no.
Hey, Captain, I just sent you an email, uh "Dear Captain, we were all so sorry for your loss.
"Please let us know if there's anything we can do.
Sent from my stinky butt".
I was hacked?
Thank you for the email.
It means a lot to me.
You're very welcome.
I was addressing your stinky butt.
Okay, guys, Captain and I are going to a charity event in Brighton beach.
Have a great Thanksgiving.
Ahem.
Sorry, Boyle.
Turkey day.
Once sergeant Jeffords and I are gone, Peralta will be the officer in command.
Jake in charge.
No-look five.
Whoo!
That's not your hand.
Wait.
Is that a healed-over earring hole?
Do you have a scandalous past?
I was stabbed in the line of duty.
The scar extends through the lobe into the neck.
No one likes it when you do that.
Anyway, thank you for taking command of the precinct over the holiday.
Not a problem.
As you all know, I hate Thanksgiving.
The pilgrims were murderers, and turkey tastes like napkins.
I just hope that no Amys feel bad that I was chosen over Amy.
Actually, Captain asked me first, but I had plans.
Teddy brewed a Thanksgiving pilsner, and it's bottling day.
Bottling day?
Why'd you come in at all?
And frankly, sir, I'm a little hurt that I wasn't your top choice to be in charge.
I'd like to remind you of what happened when I asked you to run the blood drive.
So I forgot to put up the posters, and no one came, but don't worry, because I donated 5 pints all by me-self.
It's one 12-hour shift.
What are you afraid is gonna happen?
Injury, death, general calamity.
Just don't burn the place down.
You can count on me, sir.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Turkey day.
Sorry, Boyle.
I know you're all leaving in an hour, but until that time, you're under my command.
And as leader, it is my job to make my employees' lives better, so what can I do for you?
Gina?
I would like to answer the phone always just like, "eh-heh"?
Done.
Charles?
Lift the precinct-wide ban on me saying the word "succulent".
Done.
I want to work in the break room, so I don't have to hear Charles say "succulent".
Done, done, Done-zel Washington.
If she's working in the break room, can I move my nap couch out into the bullpen?
Brooks and done.
Oh, so your plan is to not take this seriously at all?
Oh, I am as serious as a heart attack.
No offense, Scully.
Eh, mine are never that serious.
I call 'em "oopsies".
You can't just grant wishes, Jake.
You're a boss, not a genie.
I am both.
I am a boss-genie.
And this office is my lamp.
Who likes me being in charge?
Succulent.
Thanks for coming to this event, sergeant.
Always happy to spend time with you, sir.
Thank you.
Plus, the longer I stay out of my house today, the better.
My brother-in-law Zeke is in town.
Oh, I remember Zeke.
Large gentleman.
Calls you tiny Terry.
Also teensy Terry, teeny-weeny Terry-Berry, and Li'l Dum-Dum.
You know, it's the lack of effort on that last one that really gets me.
You're a grown man, sergeant, strong like an oak.
That's a pretty good tree.
It's a mighty tree.
So why not stand up to this Zeke?
I get so intimidated around him.
Thanks for the sandwich, Li'l Dum-Dum.
If you wanted to get out of the house, why didn't you just volunteer to run the precinct instead of Peralta?
I'd much rather have you in charge.
Don't worry about Jake.
He's gonna do great.
He can be very responsible.
Okay, the elevator door is the goal.
Try and score on me.
Ah!
Yes!
All right, it's noon.
We're going home.
See you later, boss-genie.
Succulent bossing, Jakey.
I'm gonna go home and stuff my goose.
Wait, Boyle, powder.
What is that powder?
I don't know.
I don't know, what do we do?
Okay, everyone, we are in lockdown, which means no one can come in or out of the precinct.
Now, apparently, three other precincts received similar packages this month, and they were all baking powder.
Nevertheless, Hazmat has to run a quick test, but I anticipate we'll all be out of here momentarily.
In the meantime, I suggest we turn this lockdown into a pop-and-lockdown.
Right?
Am I right?
Huh?
Okay, so I'll keep everyone updated, and keep working on your dance moves.
Jake, what are you doing?
This is a crisis.
I'm trying to keep morale up, because Hazmat said it's almost definitely a hoax.
Almost?
What if it's Anthrax?
We are all 100% gonna die!
Guys!
You're freaking people out.
Can you please calm it down?
We're doing fine here.
Not Hitchcock.
He got trapped out on the balcony.
I don't like him alone out there, not with his history.
I mean, what if he gets up on a ledge?
What, you think he's gonna jump?
No, he's just always falling off things.
He's got a worm living in his ear that affects his balance.
Oh, well, then he's not truly alone out there, right?
Okay, I'm gonna call Holt.
You want to come?
Yeah.
Too bad, you're not invited.
I'm in charge.
Bye!
Okay, keep me posted.
Peralta seems to have it under control.
He said things were "dope".
I want to monitor the situation.
I need to get somewhere with an Internet connection and a landline.
You live out here.
Do you have a home office?
Well, yeah, but Zeke is in that room, and Perfect.
Let's go there.
Or my neighbors are out of town.
We could break into their place.
Fine, we'll go to my house.
Or as Zeke calls it, tiny Terry's hobbit hole.
All right, sorry for the delay, but I have some news.
I gotta say, your Hazmat suit is super scary.
You should talk in a silly voice, so you seem less terrifying.
Well, we ran our test.
See, even that would be much less ominous if you just did a grover voice.
Well, we ran our tests.
And it's not baking powder.
There's a chance it's toxic.
What?
We know it's not baking powder.
What is it?
We don't know yet, sir, but we are Sir, you shouldn't have to be below eye level, so I'm gonna hold you up.
Okay, you do look good in Amy's purple shirt.
Anyways, it's Thanksgiving, so the emergency services lab is closed.
They're gonna reopen them, but it'll be at least five hours till they can run detailed tests.
Boyle, status report?
We're locked down with 42 civilians, divided into four factions.
First, we have 12 perps locked up in holding.
Okay, we will call them the dirty dozen.
Oh, I love it.
Second faction is the innocent people who just had the bad luck of being here, some witnesses, some mugging victims, couple food delivery guys.
Great, we'll refer to them as the normies.
Third faction is trouble: Your snitches, your suspects, couple of gang members here to pick up their friends.
Permission to give them a nickname, sir?
Permission granted.
The naughty boys.
Permission denied.
We will refer to them exclusively as the doinkmeisters.
Way better.
The last faction is the worst, six lawyers.
Ugh, you know what, I'm just gonna call them the vegetable medley, because that's the grossest thing I can think of.
So what's the plan?
Sir, I think we should separate the factions, so we don't become outnumbered.
We should start rationing the food now, and we should tell people that we're in for a long night, because the substance is not baking powder.
Whoa, whoa, that's just gonna freak everyone out.
We want people to be happy and calm.
We should play them sade.
Keeping the peace is important.
I'm not there to read the situation, but and I can't believe I'm actually saying this I did leave Peralta in charge, so call me if you need anything.
Oh, sir, one other thing, Hitchcock got trapped out on the balcony.
Good, sounds like we dodged a bullet there.
Yeah.
Well, that's settled.
Diaz, Santiago, I want you out there with me, keeping people's morale up.
Boyle, you go through security footage and see if you can see who brought in that box.
Okay, but, I mean, I thought since you were in charge, maybe I could be your right-hand man, your tinker bell.
Tinker bell?
Let me tell you something about tinker bell.
Tinker bell is a loyal lieutenant and a real Thorn in the side of Captain Hook.
Fine, done, you're my number two.
Yes!
I made number two.
I hear it.
Why would I ever say that?
Thank you.
I got ahold of E.S.U. The lab tech is en route from his home in New Jersey.
Sergeant, is there any way you can replace this large ball with a chair that is actually a chair?
I'm sorry, sir, that's all I've got.
But it's good for your core.
Yes.
My core, it's engaged.
I wouldn't take fitness tips from this shrimp.
Sir, you remember my brother-in-law, Zeke?
- Yes, hello.
- Hey.
What happened to the game I was dvr-ing?
I was recording it for later.
Well, the Captain wanted to have the news on, so I stopped the recording.
Well, the game was a blowout anyway.
I mean everyone died.
Sports are canceled.
You better hope that's true.
Good, he's gone.
Now, let's get serious and focus up.
Just trying to get to the printer.
Hey, hey, hey, people.
How about everyone come on, bring it in here, gather around?
So how we all holding up?
Not good.
We're trapped on Thanksgiving.
What's going on, man?
Okay, great, first off, happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
Shout-out to turkey.
Whoo-whoo!
Thank you.
All right, so here's the deal.
We are still awaiting the initial test results, but hopefully, we'll hear soon that it's all harmless and we can all go home soon.
You're doing a great What are you doing?
I'm whispering in your ear.
It's what a number two does.
It was way too close.
Can you say it quietly to me, please?
This is going really well.
Okay.
At any rate, I figured we could pass the time and do something fun, maybe a movie night.
Our options are a bootleg copy of the Diane Keaton classic, something's gotta give.
Movie's hilarious.
Okay, surprising opinion.
We'll talk about that later.
And our second option is surveillance footage of Detective Amy Santiago soliciting drugs using perfect grammar.
It's not that weird to say, "may I have some cocaine"?
It is.
Those options suck.
Fair enough, why don't we have a talent show then?
Who has a special talent?
Oh, I just learned the single ladies dance.
Hey!
Yes!
People love it.
Look at that, two painted ladies just joined in.
You got to admit, Boyle really knows how to move his pelvis.
I can't believe this is one of the last things I'm ever gonna see.
Actually, with Anthrax, the last things you'll see will be doctor, blood, doctor, pus, scab, nothing.
Why are you saying that?
'Cause you're being melodramatic, so I'm making fun of you.
Fine.
I'm writing you out of my will.
Say good-bye to my sculpture of two "jag-u-ars" making love.
Whoo!
This is why I became a cop.
Really?
People love the talent show.
Lawyer guy's doing stand-up.
He's got really good material.
Oh.
There are two jobs where you have total control over the people that pay you: President of a country and cleaning lady.
I can't believe you gave the mob a megaphone.
Okay, first of all, we didn't have a mic, and second, it's not a mob.
It's a happy group of unlikely friends.
Maybe not so happy.
People are starting to get hungry.
Oh.
Okay, not a problem.
Let's get them some food.
Voila, a Thanksgiving feast from the two delivery guys who are trapped in here with us, and paid for by me with Boyle's money.
Put it on the tab.
What about me?
Uh, I guess I could have a friend throw some pretzels up to you from the street?
And soda too?
Fine, I'll have someone blindly throw ice-cold metal cans of soda at you.
Jake, I know you think this is going well, but you can't keep putting out fires as they come up.
You need to set down some rules.
It's fine.
Everyone is happy.
Now we just coast to the all-clear.
We're freezing in here!
We want heat!
We want heat!
We want heat!
We want heat!
We want heat!
What?
I'm glad I gave them the megaphone.
It helps me hear their concerns.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go find a couple bags of heat.
Charles and I arrest the guy a couple of years ago that was selling knock-off designer coats.
We just gotta find the box they're in, and everyone will be warm and happy.
You can't let them gang up on you.
You need to man up.
Man up?
Sexist.
I'm sorry, but I don't see gender, sir.
Tell them the truth about the powder, tell them that they're gonna be here awhile, and tell them that they might have to be a little uncomfortable.
Uncomfortable because of how amazing I look in this?
Zeke, I'm sorry, but Captain thinks we're gonna have to use your room for a little longer.
No problem.
Really?
Yeah, I feel you.
I got a boss that's a jerk like that too.
Right.
The Captain's the worst.
Sometimes, I call him Holt the dolt.
That's cold.
Stay tough, brother.
Brother?
Brother.
I will, brother.
All right.
Talk to you later, brother.
See you, brother.
Bye, brother.
Okay, I have finished my last will and testament.
To Rosa, I leave you nothing.
Pass.
You can't pass on me leaving you nothing.
Just did.
Not today, Rosa.
To Charles, I leave you the memories of my supple form.
I'm reminding everyone of my embarrassing sexual past 'cause I'm hoping it's the act of charity that gets me into heaven.
Why is she talking about heaven?
Is there something wrong here we don't know about?
No, no, no!
She's just being a funny weirdo.
Everything's fine.
More importantly, I was not able to find any "heat" because it's more of a concept, but we did find these beauties.
They're all faux fur and all the best brands.
We've got ChanelB, Grucci, Stella McCarKeys.
I want the one with the muff.
Great choice, sir, but there's actually only five coats, so we're gonna have to figure out a way to share them.
I was thinking maybe a trivia contest.
Screw the coats.
I want more food.
Interesting fact there It turns out the one-time-only feast was all the food that we had.
What?
You didn't ration the food?
I'm not gonna sit here and starve.
It's Thanksgiving.
You said it was a hoax.
We're only here because of some dumb protocol.
I'm leaving.
I'm walking out that door.
Jake, you have to arrest him.
No, it'll only make things worse.
Look, we're doing this my way.
I'm the Captain now!
That totally sounded like a movie ref, but I was actually being serious.
Excuse me, sir?
Hi.
Can I talk to you in my office for a sec?
It's nothing serious, just a fun chat.
Look, if you don't come with me, she's going to arrest you.
Hey, are you guys whispering?
I'm Charles Boyle.
I'm sort of the number two guy around here.
Okay, so first of all, I'm just gonna set the mood for this meeting, perhaps a smooth jam.
Ahh.
Yeah, it's good.
All right, here's the deal.
The Hazmat guys did run some preliminary tests, and the substance is not baking powder.
Oh.
Was it Anthrax?
They don't know yet, but I promise you, as soon they tell me, you'll be the first to know.
Well, second after me, so third overall.
Still pretty good.
I just don't want people to panic, so I'm asking for your help to keep this thing quiet, so we can have the chillest biohazard lockdown in Brooklyn, yeah?
Of course, I understand.
Great, thank you.
See, if you talk to people like humans, they'll be reasonable.
I mean, it's just good Oh, why is he standing on that chair?
Hey, everyone!
They lied to us!
It's friggin' Anthrax!
Oh, what you making, a snack?
Oh, the Captain wants four sandwiches.
A spoonful of Mayo, spread evenly, middle-loaf pieces of bread only.
What an ass.
Tell me about it Brother.
Uh, I almost forgot.
He wants a whole pie too.
This dude is the worst.
I don't always understand Peralta's texts.
He says they're still waiting on the lab, and "it's allz good".
"Alls" with a "z".
Then a box with a question mark inside, another box with a question mark, another box with a question mark, another box with a question mark, another box with a question mark, and yet another box with a question mark.
Then a box with a question mark.
What does that mean?
It means you don't have emojis on your phone.
All right, everyone calm down!
Just calm down!
Let us out, or I'm gonna start breaking things!
This is a human rights violation!
You can't keep us here!
I'm 23, I'm a celebrity, and today, I'm gonna die!
Not one word of that is true.
Ow!
Ooh, Hitchcock's bleeding!
He got hit in the head with a soda can!
He never saw it coming!
Jake, we have to start putting people in detention.
We have to quash this.
No, we need them to calm down.
We need to put on something's gotta give.
Great idea.
Great movie.
Also, we should probably put out that fire.
So, Captain, I have some news.
What happened?
Well, remember when you told me not to burn down the precinct?
You burned down the precinct?
No, I had the fire put out almost immediately.
This is a success story.
Tell me exactly what happened.
Well, it started with Boyle wanting to say the word "succulent".
Oh, no.
And it ended with a small riot, in which a dirtbag set Hitchcock's nap couch on fire.
Enough!
Jeffords and I will come right away.
I'm very disappointed in you.
What's he saying?
He said he's very disappointed in you.
Oh, man!
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
I know you're too proud to say "I told you so," so I'm just gonna Told you so.
Not too proud.
That seems right.
Look, I screwed up, and I think you should take over command of the precinct.
Been waiting to hear you say that all day.
I know.
Which is why you shouldn't say it.
What?
You're still trying to make people happy.
Don't apologize to me.
Be a leader and tell me what you need me to do.
Tell everyone what you need them to do.
You're the Captain, Jake.
I'm the Captain now.
Captain Phillips.
Captain Phillips!
That's what it was.
"Look at me, look at me".
Right?
Yeah.
All right, guys, listen up.
All right, listen up, people.
Boyle, you're no longer my number two.
What did you say to him, Amy?
You've been after my job this whole time.
It's not Amy.
I don't need a tinker bell.
I need you to find out where that powder came from.
Scully, I need you to help Boyle.
Don't worry about Hitchcock.
He'll be fine.
I once saw him fall down three flights of stairs, get up, and keep eating his hot dog, like nothing happened.
You're right.
He's the strongest man we know.
No.
Gina, I know you're scared, but you got to stop freaking out the civilians.
Yes, I am very influential.
And, Diaz, you need to stop making fun of Gina and help her.
Fine.
All right, everyone, listen up!
I know this is tough to hear, but we still don't know what the powder is, and we may be here for a while yet.
Also, the copy room is now a detention center for anyone who gets out of line.
This is a police station in a lockdown, not a summer camp.
Ooh, should we play capture the flag?
Jake!
Right.
Stay tuned for more details.
That'll be all for now.
I'm just gonna go downstairs and thank your family for accommodating us.
You will do nothing of the sort.
Zeke is being nice to me for the first time ever because he thinks you're a jerk just like his boss.
When we go downstairs, I want you to scream at me.
I want you to really degrade me in front of my family.
And this will make you happy?
It's the best Thanksgiving gift you could give me.
What an idiotic thing to say.
What's a Thanksgiving gift?
I'm just getting in the zone.
I love it!
Also, I said you ate all that pie.
Can you put some around your mouth?
Fine.
Crumb me up.
I have news, everyone.
The powder was not harmful.
Scully!
Aw, I gotta say, that's pretty sweet.
Oh, the door closed behind him.
Now they're both locked outside.
What happened?
What's going on?
Lockdown's officially over.
Squad's heading home for Thanksgiving.
I don't understand.
Last I heard, the precinct was on fire, and we wouldn't get lab results for another three hours.
Boyle sped things up.
I noticed an I.T. guy we fired two years ago in surveillance footage.
Turns out he was also fired from the other precincts.
E.S.U. raided his home and found bacillus streptomoo-cocomo I can't pronounce it.
Regardless, he confessed, and it wasn't poisonous.
All right, it seems like you turned it around.
Yeah, actually, we're trying to clean up here, Captain, so unless you have something meaningful to contribute, you can get the hell out.
Oh, right, sorry, you weren't here when I switched up my management style.
That must be so confusing for you.
Anyways, everyone head on home!
Happy Thanksgiving, guys!
Jake.
Happy turkey day, guys.
I'll be in my office.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Have a nice weekend, Peralta?
Yeah, nothing special.
You know, I got a couple You missed Scully's birthday.
It was kind of a big one.
Nobody showed at the party.
Guys, guys, guys, we missed Scully's birthday, - and it was a big one.
- I know.
I panicked and said I had to go to the vet because my puppy-cat got sick.
I said I had to take my mom to get birth control pills.
That's better than my excuse.
I said I had to go to my girls' bat mitzvahs.
Squad, we missed Scully's birthday, and it was a big one.
I told them I was in Ecuador.
I think they bought it.
We gotta make it up to him.
Let's give him cash.
Everyone, put in $20 each.
Uh Yes, I'll cover you.
Hey, Scully Huh?
We're sorry that we missed your party.
Oh, don't worry about it.
You all had stuff to do.
Yes, the capital of Ecuador is Quito.
Oh.
Anyway, Happy Birthday from all of us.
Thanks, guys.
You're the best.
Happy Birthday.
Happy Birthday, Scully.
Thanks.
I can't believe it.
The fake birthday worked!
You're a genius!
We're both geniuses!
Thumbtack mug.
That was my thumbtack mug.
I'm running this task force, so everything goes through me.
Got it?
Good.
Jackson, some ecstasy was found on the F train.
Take it to the lab.
Find out if it's giggle pig.
Scully, Hitchcock, work your C.I.S. Miller, get a new k-9.
That dog is an idiot.
All right, move out.
Hey.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry I'm late.
I had to go back to the deli and return my everything bagel.
In what world does "everything" not include beef jerky?
All of them.
Okay.
Here's what's up.
Yeah.
Task force brought in a giggle pig dealer this morning.
Nice.
Second guy we've brought in that's had one of these keys.
Huh.
My best guess, this opens a creepy, old wardrobe/portal to an enchanted land full of talking toads and fairy folk.
Interesting.
It has something to do with the post office.
It's got "USPS" engraved on it.
Take it to the postal inspection service.
See what you can find out.
Copy that.
Hey, work this thing hard.
We're under a lot of pressure with the task force, so we could really use a win.
You got it.
You're my friend, and I won't let you down.
I'm gonna push you up, just like a bra.
What?
I meant like a brassiere, which is totally different.
Come on, man.
Not better.
Here we go.
Here we go!
Santiago, I may need you to come in for a bit on saturday.
Again?
Are you kidding me, man?
I'm sorry.
Let's start fresh.
Hi!
Oh, my God.
What just happened?
Her mind finally snapped, like a stale breadstick.
Captain, please forgive me.
I'm just a little on edge because I'm trying to quit smoking.
I can't take the stress of hiding it from Teddy anymore.
Be right out, Teddy!
I'm going cold turkey, and it makes me irritable.
Terrifying.
I know I should be able to do this by myself, but it would be great if you guys could maybe keep an eye on me.
Of course, we'll do everything we can to help.
Or, plan B, I could arrange for you to go to a safe place where you can just relax and watch pretty boats go by.
Look, this one's on an island.
Okay, we're looking for room 247, agent Jack danger.
Agent Jack danger?
Wow, that name is buh-dass.
Code for "badass".
Yeah.
So buh-dass.
Ah, here we are.
Wait.
Cool guy, probably expecting a cool knock.
That was incredible.
Enter.
Are you danger?
Jack danger?
It's actually pronounced "dong-er".
It's derived from a Dutch word meaning "prudence in financial matters".
Oh, Jack donger.
Also cool.
Have a seat.
I understand you need a little help from the big boys here at USPIS.
USPIS?
Yeah, U.S. postal inspection service, founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1772, undoubtedly the great man's greatest accomplishment.
Are you aware that he helped popularize parmesan cheese in America?
I am.
USPIS is the crown jewel of the law enforcement system.
everything from mail fraud to the shipment of contraband fruit.
And, of course, occasionally assisting our little brothers in the police department.
Little brothers?
Well, I am a federal agent.
You're just a local cop.
Nothing wrong with that.
Uh, we're here because we found this key.
Whoa.
Yes.
This sexy beast was used to open a type of mailbox we actually haven't used in years.
However, there are a few around town that were never removed.
Real beauts.
I can find out where they are and send you the locations.
That would be great.
Here, my email is Uh, no email.
I'll send it to you with r-mail, which is to say, real mail, because email has put hundreds of my coworkers out of work.
How would you like it if they laid off all of your fellow detectives and partnered you with a robocop?
I've literally drawn sketches of that.
The robot has a backpack that can carry me.
Hey, how's cold turkey going?
I heard chewing gum helps.
You know, I never smoked, but I did once have an addiction.
Food it got bad.
You're not closed!
It's 6:00!
I need my mushu pork!
I need my mushu!
You know how I finally stopped eating?
You got too big to fit through the kitchen door?
I learned how to beat my cravings.
Every time I wanted food, I rebooted my system.
Are you ready to reboot?
When I'd feel a food craving, I would dunk my head into ice water and reset my brain.
Watch me.
Aah!
Whoo!
I'm all good!
Yeah, you try!
Okay.
Now!
Do it again!
It's so cold!
It's really cold!
Last time.
We think the drug dealers have been using these out-of-service mailboxes as drops for giggle pig and money.
Good job.
I'm glad danger was useful.
Actually, it's "dong-er".
Although it should be "dong-est".
Can't imagine anyone being more dong than this guy.
Sounds like he was a good resource.
He showed you where the mailboxes were, right?
Yeah, but he also told us how he brought down a snail-smuggling ring.
For an hour.
Yeah, he showed us all these pictures of the snails, and he called them "the littlest victims".
Well, hopefully donger will be less annoying from now on.
Yeah, hopefully.
Wait, "from now on"?
Yeah.
Yup.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Please tell me I don't have to keep working with that Detective Peralta.
Hi.
Love your precinct.
Very primitive.
At USPIS, everyone gets his own office, but that's because we're this proud nation's first defense in the war on terror.
Every envelope is a potential target for Al-Qaeda.
Oh.
Detective Rosa Diaz, meet my new partner, Jack donger.
Please, I go by Jackie.
Jackie donger.
Of course you do.
Take it away, Peralta.
Will do.
Shouldn't have done that.
B-side's got some banging sousa deep cuts.
Thank God we're here.
Look, there's a box up there.
Oh, yeah, that is some sweet green curves right there.
We should talk to the falafel guy, see if he's seen anything suspicious.
Uh, you should probably let me take lead on this.
A lot of people don't like cops, but everybody loves postal workers.
They do?
That's why the phrase most associated with bringing goodness into people's lives is "going postal".
You're kidding, right?
"Going postal" means that I know what it means!
I just said what it means.
That's what it means.
Okay.
Well, howzabout we avoid human contact altogether and check out the box?
What's the point of that thing?
Tradition and security.
Plus, I'd be lying if I said it didn't look insanely cool.
I wouldn't.
Jackpot.
It's giggle pig.
Yes!
You have served your country proud, little lady.
Stop!
Whoa!
Ow, ow, ow, help me up!
Peralta, help!
Help me up.
Don't ditch me!
He's gone.
You okay?
No, I'm rattled.
Hey.
Hmm?
Where you going, Amy?
Oh, I was just going outside to See this pigeon I've been training.
It does the can-can.
That I gotta see!
Damn it.
I made my lie too enticing.
Fine, I was going out to smoke.
Your lame system-reboot thing didn't work.
You know, I don't like to talk about this, but many years ago, I myself overcame an addiction.
I could not get enough of the ponies.
Go, razzmataz.
Go, razzmataz.
Go, razzmataz.
It's bugle boy, winning by a head.
I lost everything.
What worked for me was replacing my bad addiction with a good addiction Exercise.
Grab your sneakers, Santiago.
You're going me on a lunchtime jog.
Great!
We can talk a little, chat about the job, do some mentor-mentee bonding.
We will exercise in silence.
No headphones either.
Music is a crutch.
I'm sorry, let me get this straight.
You had a giggle pig supplier and he got away?
What happened?
Your man here failed to follow proper law-enforcement procedure is what happened.
What?
Always check for ground-level obstructions before initiating a foot pursuit.
The ground-level obstruction was your hand clutching my leg.
I have claw marks all over my calf.
I'm sorry, Rosa, can I talk to you in private for a second?
Yeah.
We'll be right back.
Boyle, why don't you show donger what a fax machine is?
Okay.
Okay, imagine a letter had unprotected sex with a phone.
Look, it's not just that donger's annoying.
He ruined the whole operation.
The perp got away because he's the world's biggest tool.
No, tools can be useful.
He's the world's smallest tool.
I'm the world's biggest tool.
God!
Do you see what he's doing to me?
Look, these dealers didn't just randomly start using mailbox keys.
There's clearly a postal connection.
Sorry, dude, you gotta keep working with him.
Okay, wait, wait.
Let's just put this in perspective for a second.
Is this whole war on drugs really worth the human cost of me spending another minute with this behonkus?
I don't know what "behonkus" means, but yes.
"Behonkus" means butt, and I think you could have guessed that from context.
Seriously, Jake, I'm asking you to see this through.
All right, fine.
I will do it for you as a favor because you're my friend.
But if he tells me one more time about how USPIS "mailed down" the Berlin wall, I'm gonna give him your home address, and you will receive holiday cards from him forever.
My own relatives don't have that address.
Oh, I know.
I know.
And completion.
So how do you feel?
Really good.
No nicotine cravings at all.
The magic of endorphins.
I'm in a state of total euphoria.
Clearly.
Listen, I gotta jump in there, so Hello, Kevin.
No, I haven't seen it.
I very much doubt that.
Why would the housekeeper steal your belt?
What husband?
She's a widow.
I uh-oh, I have to go.
Santiago, are you smoking in there?
No.
Why do I see smoke?
That's steam.
I'm in the shower.
So what are a bunch of drug dealers doing with old postal keys?
Maybe you guys forgot to collect them all.
Mm, barking up the wrong tree, McGruff.
Postal service doesn't make mistakes.
You lose millions of letters every year.
Really?
Then explain to me why none of these missing letters have ever been found.
Okay, if it wasn't a mistake, maybe it was an inside job.
Who collected the keys?
There are five people responsible for key collection in the city.
Boom!
That's our list of suspects.
We shall call them "the fellowship of the key".
I honestly think you are the greatest man who ever lived.
Oh.
That's a no-go.
Tracking these people down is a waste of time.
I say we keep surveilling the mailboxes.
Look, I have worked a ton of these drug cases, all right?
Once they know we're onto them, they burn the whole system.
Trust me, they're done with the boxes.
Trust me.
I'm a federal agent.
You're not FBI.
You're not ATF.
You work for the post office.
Your motto is "surprisingly, we exist".
Incorrect.
Our motto is "nos custodimus quod lingus".
"We guard what you lick".
That's worse!
No, forget it.
I'm not giving you the list of names.
We're gonna keep surveilling those mailboxes, and if nothing turns up after a couple of days, then we'll go on your wild goose chase.
Hey, if you're hungry, Maury went postal and brought in muffins for everyone.
Sweet.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go grab a muff with some bluebs, and when I get back, we will discuss strategy for the stakeouts.
All right, guard the door.
I'm gonna print out this list of suspects, and then we are ditching donger.
It's kind of risky, Jake.
If this ends up being a dead end, Rosa's gonna be mad.
You know, robo-partner would not question this for a moment.
Fine, I'll be lookout.
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
What?
Is he coming?
No, but there's more than muffins.
There's banana bread too!
What?
This printer is so slow!
Come on.
Ugh, this place is the worst!
All right, two down, three to go.
Next on the list, Kent Delroy.
Worked at the post office for 12 years.
Quit two years ago.
That's the guy from this morning.
NYPD, open up!
All right, I'm gonna break down the door.
No, let me do it.
Charles, that's never gone well.
Yes, but I've been practicing.
All right, fine.
You get one try.
Thank you.
Police!
Hands in the air!
I did it!
Yes!
Boyle, that's the bad guy.
Yup, yup.
Turn around.
This way, Santiago.
What's going on?
Is this a dream?
No, I'm not holding a label maker.
Silence before the shaman.
Amy, I'm taking charge of your journey away from addiction.
Gina is leading you on a guided mediation.
Terry and I agreed to participate as a show of support.
Okay.
And, Amy, you don't know this 'cause I don't necessarily enjoy talking to you, but in my early 20s, I too battled an addiction.
I was a compulsive shopper.
Anyway, meditation helped me past that addiction.
And it's gonna do the same for you.
Close your eyes and repeat: I am in a vast hallway.
I am in a vast hallway.
I walk into the light of self-actualization.
I walk into the light of self-actualization.
For I am a powerful woman.
For I am a powerful woman.
I'm not hearing everyone.
For I am a powerful woman.
You feel the cool breeze of enlightenment gently caressing your face.
I feel it!
I feel the breeze.
Amy!
What?
I'm not the one with my eyes open.
Cheater!
Captain Holt is cheating.
Santiago, we're trying to help you.
I can't do it.
I quit quitting.
Hey, hey, people.
Task force, officially on the scoreboard with our first major giggle pig dealer busted.
Treat him well.
This guy is sort of the Mitch Globmun of getting put in jail for this.
Globmun was the first kid in my grade to get a pube.
Rosa, great news, my friend!
What the hell?
Donger just called and said you abandoned him, took information from a classified computer, and licked a roll of antique stamps.
The stamps were on me.
I was curious about how old glue tasted.
Like a horse lollipop.
Mm.
Look, it's not a big deal.
Donger wanted us to waste a week staring at mailboxes.
If I'd listened to him, I never would have caught Delroy.
Or found his books, which tell us there's a huge giggle pig shipment coming in tonight.
I told you to work with USPIS.
Okay, I know I didn't do it exactly the way you asked me to The way I ordered you to as leader of the task force.
Do you think just because we're friends you can do whatever you want?
Donger's furious.
He's on his way over here now because they're taking over the case.
What!
He can't do that.
Yeah, he can.
They're a federal agency.
From now on, any bust that comes from this, including Delroy, goes to USPIS.
My task force gets nothing.
So thanks, friend.
This table tastes like Scully's elbow blisters.
It's horrible and I deserve it.
I hate seeing you like this.
Rosa has every right to be pissed at me.
I didn't follow her orders and I messed up the task force.
The only way to make things right is to do the worst, most awful thing imaginable.
Dip your penis in vinegar.
What?
No!
Why would you say that?
In sunday school, they told us the babylonians did that to their enemies.
I've been terrified ever since.
Okay, well, what I have to do is far, far worse.
I'm sorry I was a jerk.
I'm sorry I said the postman was a flop.
I'm sorry I said "forever" stamps are a lie because the earth will eventually be swallowed by the sun.
I know what you're trying to do and I'm not buying it for a second.
I don't think you're sorry and I don't think you respect USPIS.
Maybe at first, but that was before I read, A history of the USPIS".
Oh, great read!
Yeah.
But it actually just scratches the surface.
The real story begins in the 16th century with la poste francaise.
Do you wanna hear about it?
Absolutely.
Please tell us that story.
And spare no detail.
The vinegar dip.
But this is when USPIS history gets really good.
They actually moved the headquarters back to Boston from Washington D.C. Let's jump ahead to 1820 Wait, you're just gonna jump a whole decade?
I mean, I'm dying to know how the chief postal inspector's sickly wife adjusted to the cold new England winters.
Okay, Peralta, I accept your apology.
You can have the case back.
Oh, thank you.
Truth is, I need some help.
Delroy won't tell us where the shipment's going tonight and his notebooks are all in code.
Have a look.
Have you checked out this phone number?
It doesn't exist.
Ten digits, what else could it be?
Two zip codes back-to-back.
But they're nowhere near here.
north Carolina.
Colorado.
Sterling place and Washington Avenue.
Wait a minute, Mr. postman!
That's where the giggle pig delivery's gonna be?
Yup.
We gotta go, right now.
Could you please knock it off?
It's like working inside a beaver dam.
Oh no, a next-to-desk-sit-down.
Santiago, you're putting yourself under too much pressure.
And that stress is making it even harder for you to quit.
Some things might come easier to you if you stop being such a perfectionist.
A concept you should become familiar with.
"Familiar with"?
Mm.
A dangling preposition?
I'm setting an example.
I made an error and I'm not going to correct it.
I'm just gonna let it dangle Dangle Dangle.
Thank you, Captain.
Okay, get ready, it's going down.
Wait, before we go in there Apology accepted.
No, I actually want to do it.
Ugh, so I have to suffer?
I'll make it quick.
I didn't follow your orders, I took advantage of our friendship, I'm a jerk, I'm sorry.
So that's what eternity feels like.
I could not have made that any shorter.
All right, what's the plan?
This dong is ready to ding.
What?
Tac team one will take the north entrance.
Tac team two will take the east door.
Jake, you stay out here and man the radio.
Oh, sure, whatever you need.
On it.
No, I'm just kidding, you're coming in with us.
Jerk.
Ready?
On my count.
Three, two, one.
Freeze, police!
Also USPIS.
And USPIS.
Down, down, down!
Go out the back door!
Down, down, get down!
Unh!
Hands on your head!
Unh.
What happened?
You hit your head on the doorway coming in.
Got knocked out cold.
Do I have a bruise?
A little one.
Yes!
I'm going on the wall of heroes.
Did we catch all the bad guys?
Yup, we got 'em.
All right, another win for USPIS.
You're lying in rat turds.
It's all part of the job, little brother.
It's all part of the job.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
So that's 20 cargo ships in the last three months.
Whoever's behind this smuggling ring knows their way around the docks, so we're going undercover as longshoremen.
I will be Vaughn Tom Tucker, a gruff, spitting, punch-you-in-the-gut sailor man who's taking a little break on dry land, but just until my girlfriend, Cangela, gets out of lady jail.
Ah.
Did you just spit in my trash can?
No, Vaughn did.
There's some tobacco in there too.
Vaughn chews it, but it makes Jake super dizzy.
And I'm Twink Tucker.
You cannot choose your own name anymore.
I got a job at the docks to support my drug habit, but I kept it Because I love the seagulls.
What, are you Irish now?
No.
Mm-hmm.
Well, we better get going, Captain.
Don't want to be late for our shift down at the docks.
Good news.
The leader of the cargo smuggling ring turned himself in at the eight-three.
The mafia was closing in on him.
Oh.
Oh.
That's great.
It's good news.
Yeah.
Case closed.
I guess we'll just return these outfits.
Great.
Take this back.
You have ten minutes.
Coffee, extra black, extra no sugar, and real warm.
It gets cold on them docks.
And one earl grey tea for me, Twink Tucker.
No, you ruined it.
Morning, detectives.
Let's go over the prisoner transfer upstate.
Perp's name is Jesse Hermick.
We arrested him for nine counts of armed robbery, but he skipped bail.
He was just picked up in Neustadter, New York, trying to pay for a hoagie with a gun.
The sheriff is making us pick him up tomorrow morning at 6:30 A.M., so we're going up today and spending the night.
Here are the transfer forms.
Please don't Get any Jake on them?
I'll put them in a sealed baggie.
Good call.
All the drinks I'm bringing are blue.
Naturally.
Call me if you need anything.
Yes, sir, will do.
Oh, hey, I hope this is cool with you, but since we're not technically on duty till tomorrow morning, I invited Sophia to join me upstate.
The B&B we're staying at looks really nice.
It's almost like it's haunted by fancy ghosts.
I don't mind at all.
It's actually really cute of you.
Teddy's never done anything that spontaneous or romantic.
That's not fair.
He did brew me a rose-infused pilsner once.
But it tasted like hand lotion, and the bubbles didn't happen.
Sounds bad.
Okay.
I'll see you in the car.
Okay, see you in a sec.
Hi, can I speak with Detective Teddy Wells please?
You can just tell him it's cupid calling.
Wait, no, that's insane.
Tell him it's Detective Peralta from the nine-nine.
Hello, Boyle.
After you're done here, meet me in my office.
I have something I need to ask you.
It's food-related.
I will bring my "a" game.
Oh, my God, Gina.
Captain Holt just asked me into his office for a food-related question.
Yes, I heard.
And that's how I know I don't care.
I've wanted to build a rapport with him since he got here, but until now, all we've had in common was our bank.
Guess who.
NYPD!
Hands up!
This is great.
I had no idea Captain Holt was interested in food.
I have zero interest in food.
If it were feasible, my diet would consist entirely of flavorless beige smoothies containing all the nutrients required by the human animal.
So our bank got some new ATMs, huh?
I wouldn't know.
I've switched banks.
Oh, no.
Anyway Tomorrow's my anniversary with Kevin.
I'd like to cook him an impressive breakfast.
Could you help orient me with that process?
I'd be honored.
Preparing food for one's lover is the most intimate gift of all.
Aside from washing their hair.
Okay.
I have a perp in the interrogation room.
I need all the files Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on, Diaz?
Are you sick?
Do you have cholera?
Is it typhoid?
Are you a vampire?
My horoscope said to wear a cowl-neck today, and I laughed.
I'm fine.
Diazes don't get sick.
This is allergies.
No, that's what killed the dinosaurs.
You need to go home.
Can't.
My drug task force needs a win.
That perp in there has the name of a giggle pig supplier.
I leave when I get a name.
At least let me buy you some matzo ball soup.
It's very soothing.
You know what?
I'm gonna go to the deli anyway.
Terry loves kreplach.
Hi, Sophia.
Hey.
There you are.
Hey, hey.
Mwah.
So I already checked us in, and I hope you don't mind, but I got us "the room of a thousand dolls".
Oh, sounds creepy.
Super creepy.
So I'm gonna go unpack, and then I'm gonna take a bath, and then we have dinner, and then Doin' it.
I was gonna say "dessert".
Oh.
Synonym.
Cool.
Better.
Hey, Amy.
I'll see you later.
Okay, see you later.
Oh, hey, before I forget, try to be in the lobby in about a half an hour.
I got you a little surprise.
No.
Your surprises are always terrible.
What's going on?
You have to tell me.
You're gonna love this.
Remember how you said that Teddy would never be so romantic as to turn a work trip upstate into a lover's retreat to the country?
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
I called him before we left.
He's on his way here now.
Uh, you're welcome.
Jake, I don't want to see Teddy right now.
I'm about to break up with him.
Oh, nooo Jake, why did you invite Teddy up here?
You poured blue soda all over my life.
I know.
I'm sorry, all right?
I was just trying to help.
Two maple-tinis.
Look at that.
Is that real syrup?
Right.
Sorry.
Disaster at hand.
Look, what happened with you guys?
I thought you were solid.
Didn't you just get a joint library card?
Don't remind me.
I'm gonna be untangling that web for a month.
Okay.
There's just no spark between us anymore.
We have different interests.
All he wants to do with his free time is make and bottle pilsners.
Yeah, that guy is obsessed with yeast.
It's all we talk about.
Jake, this is gonna be a disaster.
This is fine, all right?
I'll figure it out.
I'm just gonna call Teddy, tell him to turn around and go home.
No.
He's a really good Detective.
He'll figure out something's wrong.
I had an airtight breakup plan in place.
I made a reservation next thursday at a well-lit Korean restaurant in midtown.
It's the least romantic place I could think of.
Scully's bathroom.
But go on.
Teddy's a really good guy.
I don't want to say the wrong thing and hurt him more than I have to.
That's why I started writing out a breakup speech, but now he's on his way, and I'm only halfway through the outline.
All right, look, this is totally my fault, so I promise, I'll do everything I can to help.
Tonight, I will focus solely on you and Teddy.
And my very naked girlfriend.
Wow.
Sophia does not care about the cloud at all.
I'm gonna just head up there for a sec.
Hey.
What did you do to that perp?
I heard he's claiming police brutality.
He's an idiot.
I didn't touch him.
I just coughed on him a little.
Just let me help you.
I'll get your perp to talk.
I can be very persuasive.
I just negotiated my baby girls down from a pony to a hamster.
Little fools.
I don't need your help, because I am not sick.
Gina, where is the cold medicine?
I hate to point out the obvi-o-so, but why do you need the meds if you're not sick, hmm?
To fight off the cold symptoms that my healthy body is exhibiting.
I'm going back in there once this crap dries my head up.
Demon.
Okay, if Diaz won't accept our help, we got to go behind her back.
We definitely should go behind her back.
That's the opposite side of where the germs are coming from.
Knock-knock.
Man, I Oh, dolls!
Dolls!
Too many dolls!
I know.
I thought it would be funny, but it's just really scary.
One of them watched me bathe.
Yeah, we should definitely turn them around.
Yeah.
Oh, no, they have their names written on the back.
I'm Meredith.
Will you be my mother?
Oh, God.
Oh, okay, look.
The dolls are gross, but I think once we bury them, this place could be kind of romantic.
Yeah, totally.
Yeah.
But you know what would be even more romantic is hanging out, fully clothed, with two other people who have fallen out of love.
What did you do?
All right, don't be mad.
I invited Teddy up to surprise Amy, but it turns out she wants to break up with him.
And now I promised her that I would run interference, and I feel like I let you and all of our demon children down.
Oh, it's okay.
You were just trying to do something really nice for a friend, and it blew up in your face rather spectacularly.
Everything I do is spectacular.
It's a curse.
Thank you for being understanding.
Yeah, well, for the record: Very cool girlfriend.
The coolest.
Hey, and Teddy doesn't get here for another 30 minutes.
Till then Let's make out?
Great plan.
Ah.
Eh.
In the closet where they can't watch us?
Yep.
Smart.
Puppets!
Oh, there's so many puppets in there.
Now, the first step in learning how to cook is learning how to taste.
So close your eyes and open your mouth.
This isn't burning man, Boyle.
Tell me what I'm eating.
Fine.
It's a sharp Vermont Cabot.
Now describe what you taste.
Cheese.
And Cheese.
Okay.
That's good.
But try being more descriptive.
I know you love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
Why?
Their components have a long shelf life, they're cost-effective, and they're so simple, a child could make them.
Okay, I was looking for more of an emotional connection.
For example, my favorite meal is a simple roast chicken and potatoes.
It was the only dish my mother knew how to cook, and when I eat it, I feel as though I am once again inside her womb.
What's your story behind a PB&J?
I want a sandwich.
I make a sandwich.
I eat the sandwich.
Come on, Claire!
I thought you came to play.
Yikes.
Where's Teddy?
He's in the shower.
I said hi to him, we chatted for, like, a minute, and I almost blew it.
Oh, I'm sure you're overstating that.
He said he was really looking forward to a romantic evening, and I panicked and yelled "l-o-l".
Oh.
Oh.
I'm gonna be weird, he's gonna ask why, we're gonna break up, and it's gonna be super messy.
Just calm down.
We're gonna get you through this, okay?
Here's the plan.
The four of us will dine together and keep things super unromantic.
I'm great at that.
Yeah, he is.
Whoo!
Wait, should we have high-fived that?
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.
Oh, also, if you feel like you're losing control, just say the word "Jericho," and I'll pull out all the stops.
Oh, Jericho.
Safe word.
I love that.
Right?
All right, so after dinner, pretend you're sick and say you want to go straight to bed.
Me and you have to pick up the perp super early in the morning, so you only have to act normal around Teddy from the elevator to the room.
Do you think you can do that?
Yes?
Yes.
Say, "yes, I can do it.
I can be normal".
Yes, I can do it.
I can be normal.
There you go.
I can totally be normal.
Hey, everybody.
There he is!
Teddy in the house!
Who knew a prisoner transfer could be like a vacation, huh?
Hey, man.
Thanks a lot for telling me to come up here.
Yup, that was great of me.
This place is really romantic.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, not that romantic, actually.
The radiator in our room sounds like a woman screaming.
Yeah, oh, and there was a dead crow in our toilet.
You should complain about that.
Our place is really nice.
It's got a fireplace.
I'm gonna snuggle up next to that thing with you.
No, I don't want to do that.
'Cause of the cancer risks.
Most people don't know this, but sitting by a fire is actually worse than sucking on a tailpipe of a bus.
Ah, because of the germs.
Fumes.
Oh.
You know, when we first started dating, Amy and I found this really nice B&B up in the Poconos.
We got that sweet city employee discount.
Remember that, babe?
Teddy, think fast.
Drink menu.
Ow.
I'm sorry, man.
Chucked that right at you.
I just thought you really wanted a drink.
I never need a drink menu.
I got the thrills for the pils.
'Cause I'm a pilsner man.
Oh, I hadn't heard.
That's it.
I can't stop myself.
Jericho.
Jericho.
Jericho.
Ow!
That's pulling out all the stops?
What's going on?
I want to break it up.
Us.
I want to break us up.
Hey, folks.
Welcome to the maple drip inn.
Everyone excited to be here?
We having a good time?
We are not.
All right, Gina.
We have to act soon.
That cold medicine Diaz chugged It was the non-drowsy kind.
She's all over the place.
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
Guess what.
I got a new lead to ask my perp about.
It's a drug dealer on state street.
Oh!
Why doesn't someone answer that phone?
Get it.
I'll get it.
Hello.
No, there's no Michael here.
You have the wrong number.
Good-bye.
I'm Michael.
That's a dumb name, but it's yours, and you should be proud of it because you are the greatest Detective I've ever known.
No doy, Diaz.
No doy.
Where is my file?
Yeah.
She's so hopped up on that stuff, her brain's gonna blow.
I'm gonna interrogate the perp.
You keep Diaz occupied.
I don't want to get near her germ face.
Permission to lock her in a distant room?
No.
Just distract her.
Yes.
That is what I will do.
Rosa, come here.
Got to tell you something.
It's a secret.
Okay, but I have a lot of stuff to do.
What's the secret?
What's the secret?
What's the secret?
Here it is.
See?
Gina.
Let me out of here.
I got to talk to my perp.
Shh.
You know, many people think that scrambled eggs are the easiest food to make, but that is incredibly foolish.
They are a highly nuanced and complicated dish.
Okay, now, go ahead and pour your eggs right into the pan, nice and slow.
Oh.
Okay, now what do I do?
Oh, boy.
Okay, well, you hear that sizzle?
That means the heat is a little too high on those eggs.
Well, the higher the heat, the faster the eggs cook, the sooner Kevin eats.
Am I incorrect?
No, you make an excellent point, but we don't want to feed Kevin burned garbage.
Cooking is about patience.
Are you completely insane?
You never salt can to pan.
The hand The hand is the middle man.
Okay?
What you did is the culinary equivalent of unprotected sex.
You know what?
You, sir, are not ready to scramble eggs.
Hand over your spatula.
Fine.
I only wish in return I could get back all the time I just wasted on this futile project.
I'm just gonna make Kevin plain toast for breakfast.
Oh, that is low.
Hey, Boyle.
I smell burning.
Is Hitchcock roasting corn on the radiator again?
No.
What you smell is the burning wreckage of my relationship with Holt.
So there's no corn on the cob?
The main reason you want to break up with me is the pilsners?
I-I like other drinks.
It's delicious.
I want more.
It's not just the pilsners.
There are so many reasons I want to break up.
That sounded bad, didn't it?
As a lawyer, it's my duty to tell you to shh.
Okay, look.
There's just no spark between us.
That's vague.
Uh, you're Boring.
No, that's too harsh.
This is why I wanted to write it down.
Can I maybe just have two hours alone with my laptop, so I can type up a draft?
Great idea.
In the meantime, we can just chat.
You know what?
We should go.
No, actually, I think you should stay, so we can all talk about the real reason there's a problem in my relationship with Amy, which is you, Jake.
Buh what now, huh?
About how you told her that you liked her before you went undercover.
You liked Amy?
Um I did, but that was many moons ago.
Was it?
'Cause I know for a fact you also told her when you got back, and every time you would, she would get "confused," and then our relationship would get "out of sync," and if you ask me, I think it's because Amy liked you back.
Did you?
Maybe.
Yes.
A little.
I mean, I was confused.
And I really need my laptop right now.
You know what, this is officially too much for me, so I'm gonna go upstairs and rip the heads off some dolls.
Good night.
I'm gonna leave too.
If you would please leave my toothbrush and my home brewing kit at the doorstep, I'll pick them up tomorrow.
Well, I guess that's the last time I invite Teddy on a trip, right?
Drama I'm gonna go.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, it's me.
Please open the door.
Come on, let's talk.
I'm sorry.
Can I help you?
Oh, no, you're not Sophia.
Hey, Jake.
Over here, man.
Oh.
I am so sorry, sir.
You were a wrong door.
You were a wrong door.
That's a very angry man.
Look, I know what that sounded like at dinner, but I promise you, I am not into Amy.
It's not what I heard, Jake.
It's what I saw.
You should've seen the look on your face when you found out Amy liked you.
Listen to me.
"Liked"?
I'm an adult.
All this who-likes-who stuff sounds very High School.
I know, it's stupid.
You're totally right.
But the point is, I like you.
And you're sure you're over Amy?
Yes.
I mean, I didn't knock on Amy's door.
I knocked on yours.
Actually, you knocked on his door.
And I'm pretty sure he's listening.
No, I'm not.
Who's Amy?
Yeah.
Come on in.
Thank you.
The puppets are on the bed.
Good morning, Boyle.
Oh, good morning, Captain Holt.
After our disagreement yesterday, I went online to read your culinary blogs and scoff.
To my dismay, I actually learned something about how food tells a story, so I made Kevin this.
It's warm.
It's a croque monsieur.
Kevin and I shared one on a rainy afternoon in Paris on our first anniversary.
It's one of our most treasured memories.
I'm sure it's not up to your standards, but Kevin seemed to enjoy it.
So thank you for your guidance.
It's gross, huh?
No.
It's perfect.
He's a natural chef.
Now I know how salieri felt.
Everything okay with Diaz?
Yeah, she fell asleep five minutes after I locked her in, and she hasn't moved in the past ten hours.
She talks in her sleep.
I'm gonna rip your head off.
I'm gonna rip your damn head off, grandma.
Oh, tare-bear, what if she sleeps forever?
Oh, God!
Oh, look, it's Rosa!
You look great, girl.
I got to get out of here.
Bye.
You better not run, because I will catch you.
After I'm done crushing that perp, you're next.
I already interrogated the perp for you.
You what?
I got him to name his giggle pig supplier.
It's all good.
Now go home and get better.
I could've done it myself.
No, you couldn't have.
You literally have been in a coma since yesterday.
Now, I know you like to act like you don't need any help, but we all do.
I ask five dudes to spot me when I'm doing my squats.
Terry paid me $20 to lock you up.
No, I did not.
But I took that cheddar, and I made you this special "Rosa's gonna make this cold her bitch" care package.
Now's the time when you say "thank you for all your help".
Thank you for all your help.
Wait, is that a smile I see?
Possibly.
My immune system is too weak to fight off my smile muscles.
You okay?
Want some blue?
Sure.
Wow, last night really broke you, huh?
Actually, I think it was probably for the best.
I'm glad I got it over with.
Totally.
Sometimes you got to just rip off the band-aid and let the scab bleed all over the place.
That's not the expression at all.
I'm 100% it is.
So how'd it go with Sophia?
Good.
We made up.
We're still together.
I told her, you know, everything with me and you is in the past, and we're just friends, so I mean, don't get me wrong.
I am thrilled to know that you used to like me, and I will bring it up constantly.
Great.
Hey, should we make a left up here at you-used-to-like-me lane, or Ha, ha.
I could always just cut across at Amy-used-to-like-Jake boulevard.
Okay, stop it, or I'll crash the car.
Don't do that.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!
Whoa, thank you, good sir!
The elves will not starve this night.
- Any sign of our bogie?
- Negative.
Are you sure our guy's gonna show?
My C.I. said he walked this route exactly the last three days.
Fine, but in ten minutes, we're calling this.
I have to get back to my ecstasy task force.
We have to bag a major giggle pig player soon, or they're gonna shut us down.
Ho, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum.
Presents!
God, you're bad at being Santa.
Jake, holy crap, 9:00.
The Pontiac bandit, aka Doug Judy.
Okay, Santa, stay calm, just like we practiced.
Merry Judy, Mr. Doug Judy Christmas.
Damn it!
Peralta?
No!
Onion ring attack!
Ah!
Greasy!
NYPD!
Stop where you are!
Come on, Santa.
Why are you so fat?
NYPD.
Clear out.
Where are you?
Ah!
Ah!
Got you!
Doug Judy, you're under arrest.
Put your hands in the air.
Hey, Rosa.
Merry Christmas, girl.
Shut up.
Take a good look, kids.
This is what happens when you're naughty!
Attention, everyone.
Holidays of many cultures approach.
This truly is a joyful time.
Join me for a festive winter party at Shaw's bar this friday, Any questions?
A.M. or P.M.?
I'm gonna let you figure that one out.
Also, I'd like to reiterate my gift policy: none allowed.
Enjoy this merry season.
Good people of the nine-nine, I present to you the seventh wonder of the world, Doug Judy, aka the Pontiac bandit, foiled at last!
All right!
Wow, you guys, thank you very much.
All right, that's enough, Judy.
This is my moment.
You are not to enjoy it.
I can't help it.
I'm proud of you.
You're like a son to me.
A white, crispy son.
How would that even work?
Am I adopted?
No, your mother's just really pale.
Almost invisible.
Okay.
Anyways, it's a shame I gotta ruin your celebration by cutting a deal and getting out of here.
Never!
Right?
I'm just saying, I know a lot of real high-profile felons.
Makes me a very desirable tattletale.
We will never cut a deal with you, not after you screwed us last year.
You don't want any info on a local burglary ring, perhaps?
Not good enough.
Testify, Captain!
How about a guy who makes fake credit cards?
- Negative.
- You see that, Judy?
No matter what you say, you're going to jail.
What about drugs?
Y'all ever heard of giggle pig?
What do you know?
We're listening.
No, no, no, no, no, we're not listening.
We can't hear him.
Everybody shoot your guns in the air.
Gina, you need to see this.
Oh, Charles, I can't take that.
It's clearly not cash, and I don't have time in my life to return things.
I found this at my dad's place last night.
It's from him to your mom.
No!
Yes!
Boyle, this is bad.
I thought our parents were just having a casual fling, but presents is like old people third base.
No, that's rubbing butts together.
What?
But this is very close.
Gina, they may be getting serious.
Ugh!
Don't you dare say that!
Do you know how disgustingly entangled our lives will be if our parents turn into a real couple?
Yes!
You think I want you and your mom horning in on the Boyle boys mimosa brunches?
That's our guy time.
Ugh.
We need to figure out what is in this horrible package, so we can determine where they're at in their relationship.
What if it's a romantic book or, like, a picture of the two of them in a frame?
Oh, or "his and hers" pajamas?
The kind that dissolve in your mouth.
Ew, no!
No, Charles, ew.
So this is where all the tape went.
I gotta put up this pictures my daughters drew.
And I need some 'cause I cut my hand.
Hitchcock!
Go to the hospital!
And give 100 bucks to some doctor to give me the exact same tape?
I don't think so.
Wow!
What's all this?
I'm making a Christmas present for Captain Holt.
I know, I know.
He has a strict "no gift" policy, but I found a loophole.
Like your loophole last year?
So I was just gonna throw out this brand-new squash racquet, but then I thought, "hey, maybe the Captain could use it".
I don't want your garbage.
No, it was a very expensive gift.
Aha, suspicions confirmed.
I asked the Captain what qualified as a gift, and he said anything I spent money on.
Then I realized, my time is worth nothing.
Sounds like you're bragging, but that's just a sad statement.
I'm making a scrapbook of his professional highlights.
Newspaper clippings, police reports, pictures.
It's got every moment of his career, "from Ray to Z." This is a very bad idea.
I know, I'm not happy with the title either, but my backup was "keep holting on," but that just makes him sound like he's sick.
All right, before we make a deal with this evil monster, can I just ask something?
Is giggle pig really that important?
My job, Rosa's job, and the fate of this entire precinct all depend upon the outcome of this task force.
All right, fine.
Diaz, what's our status right now?
We've picked up a bunch of dealers, but our main target is Tito Ruiz.
We believe he runs the whole operation, only we can't prove it because none of his people will turn on him just because he bit off a few noses.
Babies.
I say the only way we make a deal with Doug Judy is if he can give us the top guy, Tito Ruiz.
I can give you Tito Ruiz.
Oh, come on, Judy!
I mean, how do we even know this is real?
This guy's a huckster!
He's a lie guy.
Peralta has a point.
You have been a lie guy to us before.
Thank you.
Give me some details.
Ruiz and I were cellies in Attica in the '90s.
He texted me last week.
Needs some cars to deliver his product.
I said no because drugs are stupid.
Except for weed and sex pills.
A man has needs.
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa, Rosa I can't think of your last name, baby Enough crooning!
Can you get us a face-to-face with Ruiz?
Yeah, but you gotta give me zero jail time.
No, that's not gonna happen.
Ha-ha!
Stupid Judy.
The D.A., however, will offer a reduced sentence in return for Ruiz's arrest.
Oh, that's tough but fair.
I can see why you have such intense daddy-stuff with him.
Oh, yeah, the guy without a daddy is the one with daddy issues.
Explain that logic.
Since I'm going to jail, I wanna enjoy my time left on the outside.
Put me up in a five-star hotel like the Royce.
Unlimited room service and minibar privileges.
Three-star hotel like the Brooklyner.
$60 a day meal allowance.
No minibar.
Four-star hotel like the Oneida.
no minibar or alcohol, but I get to go crazy on candy and nuts.
Agreed.
Ow!
Oh, one last thing.
Diaz has to be nice to me.
I want her to call me big sugar.
Ha, hugh mistake, bud.
She'll never agree to that.
No, I'm in.
Let's do this, big sugar.
Ah!
What?
All right, fine.
If this is going down, I wanna be on this case, and my sole focus is Doug Judy.
He never leaves my sights.
Love it!
Pontiac bandit and Jake.
PB&J ride again!
Reunited and it feels so good It's a duet.
Get in on this.
Reunited 'cause we understood No!
No!
All right, big sugar.
Four-star hotel room, you happy?
Okay, okay.
Okay, flat screen TV.
King-sized bed.
Hangers you can take off the rod?
This is what's up.
This place is nice.
We should settle down here, Rosa.
Now if y'all excuse me, I'ma go freshen up.
I'm feeling stanky.
Hold it!
Not so fast.
What?
Let's make out.
Not yet.
All right, there's no windows.
You can go in.
But leave the door open, and I'm hanging on to this.
What in the world would I do with that?
Point it at my face until my eyeballs dry out and I lose my sense of sight.
Then shove it in my mouth, so I can't yell for help, and finally run out the front door and disappear forever.
Nah, I was just gonna use it to dry my undercarriage later.
Ugh.
Would you just relax, okay?
Stop being so paranoid.
I'm playing ball.
I got you.
If you'll excuse me All right, we can't be too careful.
Let's go over the plan one more time.
Doug Judy texts Ruiz to set up a meet.
We each have a hidden wire, and we record Ruiz talking about giggle pig, then take him down.
Tac team is on call for backup What are you doing?
You look like a pervert.
Putting a GPS tracker in his shoe.
He is not getting away from me again, even if it means putting my favorite hand into his rotten stink-boot.
Okay.
Hoo-hoo!
Did you see the menu?
Lobster thermidor.
Baked Alaska.
It's so fancy, it don't even sound like food.
Here, come on.
Order something.
Order it.
Do it.
Order it.
No, thanks.
I'm on duty.
Come on, Peralta.
You gonna let the criminal have all the fun?
All right, fine.
I'll have one lobster thermidor, extra thermidor on the side.
I have no idea what I'm ordering.
Me neither.
We're like culinary magellans.
You know how we take this to the next level?
Robes!
Robes!
Reunited And it feels so good Reunited Okay, we just unwrap it, we see what's inside, then we perfectly rewrap it.
Our parents never know what happened.
Ugh, lord, you're starting to sweat.
You're gonna blemish the wrapping paper.
You're dabbing me really hard.
You know what?
This is taking too long.
Just scooch, you pooch.
You are amazing.
How did you do that?
I always open my gifts in advance, so I can rehearse my reactions and nail those Christmas-morning candids.
Check it out.
Be-wonderment.
Disbe-loving it.
Sparkle-surprise.
I like that.
Now focus up.
Your dad got my mom A digital scale?
That's bad.
So bad, so wonderfully bad.
Your dad might as well have circled all the parts of my mom's body he didn't like with a marker.
You did that to me.
And it didn't help at all.
Nope.
My mom is gonna hate this gift.
And she'd hate it even more if we were both there when she opened it.
Should we do a gift exchange dinner tonight with both our parents?
Great idea.
Maybe she'll slap him in the face and never talk to him again.
Sparkle-surprise, for real!
Three lobster thermidors, spaghetti and meatballs, Caesar salad with tater tots instead of croutons.
Oh, that's me.
Salad.
I'm trying to eat healthy.
I hear that.
Your body is a temple.
All right, I'm searching it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Peralta, what you doing, putting your fingers in my fancy feast?
What?
How am I supposed to escape using a lobster?
Squeeze the lemon in my eyes, so I can't see, stab me in the jugular with a claw, and then shove the tail down my throat, so I can't scream for help.
I gotta keep my eye on you, Judy.
You're a slippery guy.
Fair enough.
That I am.
But for right now, I'm all about helping you.
So why don't you just chill and eat some sexy-ass lobster?
Okay, we held up our end of the bargain.
Text Ruiz now, friend.
Fine.
Tito, dot, dot, dot.
You around, question mark.
Wanna meet up, period.
Speech to text, we live in a magical age.
It's like The Jetsons.
By the way, this Tito dude, he spooks real easy, so No, there's no way you're going in alone.
We're coming with you.
I've already got my cover story worked out.
My name is Dante Thunderstone.
I stole my first car at the tender age of nine.
You had to fend for yourself since your mother was struck by lightning.
While she was pregnant with me.
She passed.
I lived.
Some say that makes Zeus my dad.
Oh!
Mythic.
That's dope.
And, Rosa, you could be my wife Rosa.
Why would you take your wife with you to meet a drug dealer?
'Cause we're partners in everything we do.
Aw.
Whoa.
Tito wants to meet up.
Great, tell him to meet us over here.
We'll get him a lobster and a robe.
I mean no, let's go catch him in the act.
Sarge, I'm freaking out about my gift that's not technically a gift.
Somehow, that doesn't surprise me.
Something horrible has happened, and I don't know what to do.
Has Captain Holt ever told you about the Brooklyn broiler?
Yeah.
Arsonist.
Burned down 12 buildings in Crown Heights.
Captain's told me about it many times.
You flamed out.
Dirt bag.
Well, I think that Captain may have made a mistake.
What are you talking about?
I was doing follow-up research on the case for a fun "where are they now"?
Section, and I don't think the broiler set three of the fires he was charged with.
I gotta tell the Captain.
Do you think he'll be upset?
Probably not.
I mean, he seems like the kind of laid-back guy who delights in having his mistakes exposed.
Maybe next year you can do a collage about low points in his marriage.
I know you're being sarcastic, sarge, but I really do love making collages.
Ruiz's bodyguards.
Prepare to be touched in some real intimate places.
I'm clean.
Watch it.
Where did you get those shoes, man?
There he is.
Tito, what's up, my man?
Doug Judy.
Who are they?
That's my bodyguard, Selena.
We're doing it on the D.L. He's an amazing lover.
I'm pregnant.
Oh, nice!
And this here is my partner, Dante Thunderstone.
The one and only.
Brrrat, brrrat, brrrat!
Okay, Judy.
If we're gonna do business, I gotta see how good you really are.
This is a test.
Go jack that car right now.
Give him the tools.
No worries.
That is a cinch to pinch.
There's no way you're getting in that car alone.
Hey, where are you going, Thunderstone?
To steal the car.
I jack the rides.
Judy holds my tools.
Fine.
Then you have two minutes.
Only need one.
That was tight.
You played him like a boss.
Thanks.
Now I just need to magically learn how to steal a car.
Braat, braat!
Okay, okay, all I have to do is break into this car and drive it away without a key.
Something wrong?
Nope, just, uh, warming up my stealing fingies.
Relax, Thunderstone.
It's easy.
Here.
What are you talking about?
Oh, just, uh, telling Thunderstone how I move it on the dance floor.
Always start with a side-to-side sway.
Real smooth, real slow.
Real smooth and real slow.
Yeah, and when I feel that groove, I pop it!
Yeah.
And I pull it, pull it back.
Pull it back hard.
Whoo!
Ha-ha!
Yeah.
Yes, I love the way you dance, Doug Judy.
All right, this next part is like french kissing.
Got it.
Jam it in there and move it around wildly.
I gotta ask, Peralta, do the ladies enjoy that technique?
Ten seconds.
Come on.
Ah, yes!
Okay, let's go.
Thank you, Charles, Regina, for inviting us on this double date.
Kind of like a fun Christmas four-way, right?
Well put, Lynn.
Yeah.
A very sweet sentiment.
Oh, my God!
I have an idea.
Let's open presents.
Okay.
Oh.
I wanna see what everyone got everyone and how everyone reacts poorly.
Fun, fun.
I just hope you like it.
I don't know.
A digital scale?
Lynn Boyle, you're a horrible, horrible man.
You went way over our price limit.
Yes, I did.
And I love it!
Yay!
It's gonna go so great in the guest bathroom.
What?
Lynn and I are moving in together.
Mm-hmm.
And the rent's a little steep, so we promised we would only exchange small gifts.
Mm-hmm.
But you had to push it, didn't you?
I did.
You naughty boy.
I had to get my pookums a present, pookums.
Okay, well, this is wonderful, but I am needed elsewhere, so I'm gonna take off.
Thank you so much.
Nog, nog.
Little Christmas humor.
Yes, the "nog" from "egg nog," used in place of "knock".
I stand corrected.
He loved it.
So I was just looking through some old files, and I think I may have found a mistake in a closed case.
Which one?
It was actually Now that I think of it, if I'm remembering correctly, and I could be wrong on this, but It's the Brooklyn broiler.
What?
That dirtbag flamed out ages ago.
Why were you looking at that case?
She was making you a gift Not a gift, snitch.
It didn't cost me anything, just my worthless man-hours.
"From Ray to Z"?
I thought I told you no gifts.
Take this away, and bring me the broiler's file.
I'll look into this mistake.
Actually, the evidence is part of the scrapbook, so I have to leave the whole thing.
Fine, I'll look at the relevant pages, but as for the rest, I will not peruse.
Wow, sweet setup.
What do you make here?
Don't worry about it.
Oh, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
We need 20 cars a week.
I want to use them each once, then dump 'em.
Oh, well, you picked the right man.
So are we gonna make a deal or what?
Or do I need to talk to your boss?
You can talk to me.
So you're the boss?
Yeah, I'm the boss, and this is my place.
And in my place, people know they shouldn't ask dumb questions.
Got it?
Yeah, I got it.
I tried to tell him, Tito.
All right, let's talk deets.
Is that us?
No, we gotta go right now!
Go, go, go!
On the ground!
NYPD!
NYPD.
Nobody move!
Diaz!
Don't need help.
Behind you.
Bye bye, Peralta.
Here's your GPS.
No!
Let's go!
Ha-ha, I got you!
Yeah, you did, but your boy Tito's getting away.
Damn it!
Damn you, Doug Judy!
I'll never forget you, Dante Thunderstone!
You have the right to remain Doug Judy.
Anything you Doug or Judy can be used against you in a Doug of Judy.
Sorry, I'm preoccupied by someone who will remain nameless.
I'll start over.
Santiago, I want to thank you for my gift.
You like the scrapbook?
I don't know.
I'm a man of my word, so I did not peruse.
The gift I'm referring to was you pointing out my mistake.
Do you know why I don't accept gifts?
Because you're so evolved, you don't need material things.
Because I don't like brown-nosing.
Oh.
Youch, that was hard to watch.
You told me to my face that I made a mistake, and that's as far from brown-nosing as one can get.
I respect you for that.
Now I have a gift for you.
I have the complete Brooklyn broiler files.
He was given three life sentences, and it should have been two.
So I've already contacted the D.A. about the error.
Will you please help me figure out who set those other fires?
Ooh!
More work!
I know that sounded sarcastic, but Nobody thought that.
Not for a moment.
Great.
Chaz-ma-taz, how we doing, baby?
I thought you'd be in an awful mood.
Why would be upset when I've never had more purpose in my entire life?
Are you gonna poison my dad?
No, our parents say they're in love, but we both know that's just their old brains disintegrating.
We need to break them up for their sake, for our sake, for the sake of this great nation.
Agreed.
Ew!
I forgot how clammy your hands are.
Mood unaffected.
Mood unaffected.
Attention please!
Attention.
I'm sorry to interrupt your holiday revelry.
It truly is a fun night.
I'd like to propose a toast to Detective Diaz and her task force, who successfully brought down Tito Ruiz and his entire giggle pig network.
Great work, everyone.
Drink up!
Yeah!
Hey, so I checked again.
Doug Judy still hasn't surfaced.
Yeah, he has.
He just sent me this.
What's up, Peralta?
Greetings from paradise.
Actually, I'm a little disappointed in the hotel.
How do you mess up an omelet?
It's just a flat egg.
He pretty much just talks about the omelet for the next ten minutes, but About my escape.
This is my associate Kyle.
He drove the garbage truck.
You may also remember him as the room service waiter I had you tip so generously.
Son of a bitch.
Yup, and when he ordered the lobster, it was code for Kyle to follow him.
Anyway, tell Diaz she loves me.
Merry Christmas!
Hey, first things first.
I swear to you we are gonna catch Doug Judy.
Yeah, I know.
We did it once.
We can do it again.
No.
We will catch him.
More importantly, thank you.
I know how hard that was to make that choice and let him get away.
No, it was an easy call.
I know how much this task force means to you.
It means so much, and it's been so stressful, and it went so well.
Seriously, look at me, I cannot stop smiling.
How do people do this with their faces?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Good morning, Diaz, Peralta.
Captain.
You're smiling.
It's very weird, like seeing a turtle out of its shell.
I'm happy.
Our drug task force was a success, and today, I get to watch my Nemesis, Madeline Wuntch, drape a medal around my neck.
Also, we cleaned up the streets.
Yeah, sure.
That's good too.
So I've been planning how to zing Madeline when she puts the medal on.
I have the perfect line.
"Wuntch-time is over".
It's a It's a play on "lunch time".
Yes, devastating burn, sir.
But you know what would really show her is if you said nothing at all.
Oh, interesting.
Interesting.
Let Madeline know she's not even worth my staying up all night crafting zingers.
"Wuntch-time" took you all night?
Trust me.
Turn the other cheek.
Which I recently learned is about faces and not butts, but works either way.
Yes.
I should be the bigger person.
That shouldn't be hard, given that Madeline's not technically a person.
For meritorious service, the NYPD bestows this award on detectives Rosa Diaz, Jake Peralta, and Captain Raymond Holt.
Raymond.
Madeline.
You won.
Go ahead and gloat, you toad.
Thank you for this honor, deputy chief.
Oh.
Okay.
You're welcome.
Wuntch-time is over.
Boom!
Did it!
Had it both ways.
No regrets.
Listen up, gang.
We have intel on a drop house used by Alexei Bisko, a Captain in the Ukrainian mafia.
Oh, he should be psyched.
That's a very up-and-coming mafia.
His soldiers use the site to drop off money and pick up weapons.
We need a couple of teams to do long-term stakeouts.
I'm out.
Four hours is the most I've ever spent alone with any human.
It was the worst experience of my life.
What about that time we drove out to Boston together?
That was about four hours.
Oh, I see what just happened.
The only decent vantage is this condemned hotel across the street.
We can go in as exterminators, but too much movement will look suspicious.
It's an eight-day op, so two teams will do four days each.
Boyle and I are in.
Okay, that's one team.
Who wants to relieve them?
If extraction is a risk, the two of us can do the full eight days.
A Hanukkah miracle.
No, that is too long to be holed up together like that.
I did a six-day stakeout once.
Did not go well.
Well, that's not gonna be a problem for us.
The only time I ever yelled at Charles was cheering him on at his roller boogie competition.
We never fight.
It won't be a stakeout, it'll be a stake-cation.
Stake me out tonight I don't want to let you go till we catch this guy We already have a theme song.
That concludes this meeting.
Ooh, what's this?
None of your business.
"None of your business"?
The most enticing words a person can say.
Terry, I will not leave your side until there are no secrets between us.
Fine.
I'm making my twins a picture book for their birthday.
It's calledJune Bug and Cricket: Adventure girls.
Whoa, this one looks just like you, Gina.
Yes.
She is straight-up gorgeous.
And this one's definitely you.
Look how masculine the clothes are.
It's a suit of armor.
Pantsuit of armor.
The drawings look like you two, but only because it's easier for me to draw from real life.
The whole squad's in here.
Tiny squirrel is Charles, the walrus is Captain Holt, and the hippo with heads on both ends, that's Hitchcock and Scully.
How do they defecate?
It's a kid's book, Santiago!
This is why I didn't want to show it to people.
Pickin' it apart.
Oh.
Oh, my God, did you carry us up here like suitcases?
No, man.
This is real life.
I rolled you in on the cart.
Boo!
Terry sucks!
Terry sucks!
Terry's great.
Terry's great.
Where do you want the food?
And does braided herring and jellied starfish count as food?
Oh, indeed it does.
I may be stuck in a tiny room, but my palate will travel the world.
Listen up.
This is a real small room.
If you start getting on each other's nerves, do what I do with my babies: Go to separate corners.
We call it "alone zones".
All due respect, sarge, but we don't need "alone zones".
No, we do not.
But let me ask you a question.
How do we feel about scone zones?
I feel great about it.
Me too.
Sarge?
I'm a muffin guy.
Boo!
Boo!
Great news, my friend.
We have a bathroom pet.
His name is Horace, and he's either a small rat or a large cockroach, and he's either sleeping or dead.
Here's the schedule: Eight hours both on watch; Eight hours I sleep, you watch; Eight hours you sleep, I watch.
I set an alarm.
I made the perfect ringtone.
Listen.
Stake me out tonight I don't want to let you go till we catch the guy I love it.
All right, we got binocs, camera, night vision goggles, computer, and Mini-basketball.
Oh, my God, I love that.
My whole problem with basketball was big ball, tiny hands.
Tiny ball, problem solved.
Oop me.
Ready?
Ooping.
One, two, three!
Did that look as cool as it felt?
How cool did it feel?
Mm.
Everyone, this is my nephew Marcus.
He's new in town.
He's staying with me until he finds a place.
He is 31.
You're a terrible hype-man.
And you must be Gina.
I heard a lot about everyone.
I take it you're Amy, Rosa, Terry I'm Jake.
We're both Jake.
Scully and Hitchcock.
Hey, well, I just came to get the keys from my uncle Ray.
Let everybody get back to work.
Nice meeting you.
Pleasure.
Bye.
Holy Moses.
"Bye"?
What?
For you, that's basically walking up to him and jamming your tongue down his throat.
Shut up.
Yes, Gina, that's enough.
You're right.
Sorry.
Too far.
But let me just add one little thing off topic.
Rosa wants to bone your nephew.
Stake me out tonight I don't want to let you go till we catch this guy Wow.
That sleep apnea mask is something else, huh?
I got to say, ever since I got her Her?
She touches my lips, Jake.
She's a her.
And since she took up residence on my face, I sleep like a baby.
Okay.
Well, while you slept, there was some action at the drop site.
A blue sedan pulled up.
I got the plates and the driver's face.
Also, this is the guy who runs the drop house.
I call him "the beach umbrella" because he looks so shady.
Oh.
Hey, this is a kind of weird request, but would you maybe mind chewing your nortfluskers with your mouth closed?
I can't, and I'm excited to tell you why.
I have a new eating method.
I realized that open mouths oxygenate the food, so it's kind of like wine tasting.
And I hear you, buddy.
I really do.
It's just It's pretty gross, so maybe just while we're together, you could keep the old chewer shut?
Okay, but I don't complain about how gross your meal is.
What's gross about pancakes with butter and maple syrup?
You've completely abandoned the pancake part.
Now you're just eating butter with syrup on it.
Yeah, I cut out the carbs.
This is me being healthy.
Okay, well, maybe we just eat in separate corners of the room.
Great.
I love that plan.
Wait!
That's alone zones.
We don't need alone zones.
We're fine.
We're not fighting.
We're great.
Eat your butter-syrup.
Yeah, keep that chew hole open.
Stake me out tonight I don't want to let you go till we catch this guy It's a shift.
Love this song.
I can't even remember the original lyrics anymore.
Hmm.
Black SUV, female driver.
She's wearing a lot of drab colors, so we'll call her Mrs. peacock.
Male peacocks are the colorful dressers.
God, how did humans get it so backwards?
We may never know.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, listen, about our alone zone close call Oh, that It's not a big deal.
We're not gonna start fighting.
We never fight.
Yeah, totally.
Yeah.
That's what I was thinking.
But just to be safe, we could write down some of each other's annoying behaviors that we want to be off-limits, you know?
We could call it "the no-no list".
Oh, I love it.
Okay, so here's what I've got for you.
No eating with your mouth open.
We knew that.
No rasta-man voice, no reciting poetry, no ballroom dancing, no bird calls, and no male kegels.
Can I do my kegels secretly?
Watch this.
You'll never know I'm doing them.
I can definitely tell.
All right, give me my no-no's.
Okay, no butter-syrup, no talking about Die Hard Okay.
I can do that.
Or Die Hard two or Die Hard three.
What?
Come on.
So you just want me to talk about the fourth one?
There's a fourth one?
Charles!
No judging me for not knowing the Die Hards.
All right, fine.
What else?
Okay.
No eating mayonnaise straight from the jar, no using my toothbrush.
And that's it.
Jake, this no-no list, it's a slam dunk.
Oop me.
Ooping.
I'm getting better.
Yeah, you are.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Have a seat, Diaz.
You remember my nephew Marcus?
The 31-year-old?
He asked me to ask you if you are single.
I'm told him I'm not a third-grade girl with pigtails passing love notes.
Yeah, it's so immature.
Precisely.
It's embarrassing.
Agreed.
I am single.
Oh.
I see.
But if Marcus wants my number, he can ask me for it.
But who will tell him that?
Um, yeah.
You took the last danish.
Oh, sorry.
Did you read Terry's book about us?
No.
He said not to read it.
Okay, fine, I read it.
My character, Cricket, is such a pushover.
She just lets all the forest folk take her magic moose wishes.
Well, June Bug is a stone-cold bitch.
She told all the baby platy-pups they had weird feet.
Is that how people see us?
Well, you did just steal that danish out of my hand and start eating it.
And I let you.
And apologized.
Classic Cricket move.
Hey, can I just scootch in there to the coffee?
You can scootch your ass back in line.
My coffee needs are just as important as yours.
What was that all about?
Terry, I try not to judge people, so I wouldn't know.
Maybe I should go check on little Amy and give her the greatest gift of all A hug.
Come on.
Someone use the drop house.
The drop house.
Perfect name for a porta-potty company.
As soon as we get out of here, I am taking that straight to shark tank.
How great is this no-no list?
I mean, we've made it impossible to annoy each other.
We're gonna make out with this stakeout.
Mm.
Hey, bud, is rhyming on your no-no list?
No.
Cool, cool.
Just seems pretty close to reciting poetry.
Yeah, yeah.
But it's different.
Yeah.
It's different.
It's different.
I'm just gonna add it.
Oh, so we can add things now?
Yeah, why not, right?
I mean, we got the time, and we got the ink.
Everything but the kitchen sink.
What did I just say?
Okay.
That is under Charles.
Sure, sure, sure.
Cool, cool, cool Good.
To the window.
Get back in the window.
What is happening?
I got to do this or the bullet holes in my butt stiffen up.
No talking about your butt holes.
Two Three No pull-ups.
No yoga.
No beatboxing.
No letting it mellow.
No sister act.
No life hacks.
No multi-level marketing schemes.
No calling legitimate business ideas "schemes".
No licking fingers before turning pages.
No impressions.
No tea ceremonies.
No cabbage patch.
No parkour.
No running man Movie or the dance.
No unrequested lullaby.
No lady-style towels.
Hey.
No nose hair trimming.
We're here for eight days, Jake.
I don't care.
It's on the list.
Well, I hope you like nostril bush.
Nostril bush?
All right, no more talking.
No more talking at all.
Fine, I'm putting that on your list too.
That was talking.
So was that.
Okay, fine.
In three, two, one.
No talking.
Zip it.
Hey, Captain.
How's the operation going?
Great, the beach umbrella has had nonstop visitors.
"The beach umbrella"?
Bisko's lieutenant who runs the drop site.
We came up with fun little nicknames for everyone.
I'm glad you're amusing yourselves.
People thought you'd be at each other's throats by now.
Do you need a relief team?
What?
Nuh-uh-uh!
No sassy "nuh-uh-uhs".
What was that?
Uh, nothing.
I just said we don't need a relief team.
Everything's going great.
Right, Boyle?
Right.
So great.
Good.
See you in a couple of days.
Okay, sounds good.
Okay, bye.
Bye-bye now.
Bye.
I love you.
What?
Hold the door.
Sorry, sarge.
Maybe if you did more cardio and less weights, you'd move faster.
No, no, no, Amy.
We need to be the change we want to see in the elevator.
Uh-uh.
Door open.
Door open.
Door close.
Door close.
Door open.
Door open.
What is going on with you two?
What's going on with you?
Love.
That's it.
Time for an emergency stop and talk.
Okay, fine.
You want to know what's going on?
We read your book.
And you should know I'm not a pushover.
And I'm not a stone-cold bitch.
I'm a natural, beautiful presence.
Okay, I'm sorry these characters look like you, but that's where the resemblance stops.
Sure, June Bug is a meanie to the platy-pups, but she's a sweetheart to the socktopus.
And Cricket is a pushover when it comes to magic moose wishes, but she's very brave in the dolphin wars.
I guess what I'm saying is, these stories are nonsense.
I love you guys, but if you're bringing something more to my book, that's on you.
If you hadn't stopped the elevator, you could have walked off after your great speech.
Now we all got to sit in it.
Marcus, you leaving?
Come, have breakfast with us.
You're up early.
Okay.
And Detective Diaz is here as well.
Hey.
Hello, Kevin.
Rosa.
Marcus.
Kevin.
Uncle Ray.
Marcus.
And cheddar.
Cheddar is also here.
Uh, would you care to join us?
Sure.
Shall we sit?
I don't think Sit.
Good, then feel no obligation to stay, Rosa.
Detective Diaz.
Detective Rosa Diaz is in my breakfast nook.
So who would like french toast?
I can put a bacon smile on it.
My being here is weird.
This was a bad idea.
We shouldn't see each other again.
Well, Detective Rosa Diaz has left.
Hmm.
The only food left in the whole room is your stupid herring.
Oh, so we're talking now?
Well, I guess so, since words came out of my mouth and you heard them.
That's glib.
No being glib.
It's on the list.
I'm so sick of the list.
I don't even know what "glib" means.
Ask yourself this.
Is it something you can hear Garfield saying?
If so, it's glib.
So what, you want me to just be Garfield's owner, Jon Arbuckle?
Think about what you're saying.
He's spineless and bland.
And by the way, me keeping things light and being "Garfeldian" is the only reason we don't fight.
Wrong, baby.
The only reason we don't fight is because I never say anything when you annoy me, which is constantly, baby.
I just let it roll off.
I'm a duck's back, baby.
Stop saying "baby".
Charles Boyle calls people "baby" when he gets angry.
That's who I am.
And all this is who I am.
And if you don't like this stuff, then we shouldn't be friends.
Great.
'Cause guess what?
We're not friends.
That's fine with me, baby.
Uh-oh.
Well, the operation is blown.
Stake me out tonight I don't want to let you go till we catch the guy Oh, I hate this song.
I stand by it.
Well, I'm gonna check this stuff back in.
Great.
Do it.
Okay.
Then we're done.
Yeah, then we're done.
Well, well, well.
Looks like Boyle's out and Hitchcock's in.
What do you want to do tonight?
Go to a strip club?
Have dinner with my wife?
Are those separate options, or does she live at the strip club?
You want to know, you got to go.
Okay.
Peralta, thanks to your basketball mishap, the drop site has been abandoned, and Alexei Bisko's gone to ground.
We told you eight days was too long for a stakeout.
With all due respect, sir, it wasn't the amount of time.
It's who I was stuck there with.
I could easily have done it with Scully.
Really?
You would've applied that cream to his back?
No, I would've put it on the floor and let him roll around in it.
This isn't my first rodeo.
You need to find Bisko.
You can start by doing door duty, see if anyone knows where he is.
Take Boyle.
Sir, I'd like to request a new partner.
I can't work with Charles.
We're not friends anymore.
"Friends"?
I don't care if you're friends.
This is not a playdate.
This is your commanding officer ordering you to do your job.
Fine, but I hope you can live with the fact that you're forcing people to spend time together who would rather not.
I'm fine with that.
Sarge, I need to talk to you about the kid's book.
Seriously?
I'm wrapping it right now, and I need to focus.
Look, I know the story is nonsense and I'm not a forest nymph who wears armor pantsuits, but I think it bothered me because sometimes I can be too much of a pushover.
To be honest, it felt nice to stand up for myself this week.
Good for you, Santiago.
I also learned a valuable lesson from your stupid book.
I learned I'm perfect the way I am, and I should never change.
This is a symbolic gesture.
I'm speaking to you as a friend, not a Captain.
And as your friend, I have this brassiere you left behind in Marcus' room.
Also, I just wanted you to know, um, I think Marcus is great, and And you're great, and I hope the fact that you and I work together won't prevent you from dating if that's what you want to do.
I might.
But I don't want to talk to you about it.
Perfect, because I'm not comfortable knowing about it.
Great, then let's never talk about it.
Let's never talk about anything.
Done.
This is Bisko's aunt's apartment.
Maybe she's seen something.
Let's just get this over with.
Yes?
It's Bisko.
Fire escape.
I'll cut him off at the back.
Freeze!
NYPD!
Fatty had it made Like a blade in the sun, like a push in the bush Hey!
When you got none Ping pong Alexei Bisko, you're under arrest.
You okay?
Yeah.
Thanks for having my back.
You don't have to thank me.
I've always got your back.
Look, this whole thing has been so stupid.
Right?
Are we friends again?
No.
We're brothers.
Gah, that was terrifying!
Don't pause like that.
Look, brothers fight, but at the end of the day, they're always there for each other.
My brother had sex with my wife, and then he ran to the Florida keys.
One day I'll finish him.
Just be arrested, man.
We're trying to have a moment here.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Interesting.
Very, very interesting.
Guys.
Captain Holt has no pants on.
Um What?
He has no pants on, is what.
Here are the facts: At 11:55 A.M., Captain Holt walked past us holding a hot bowl of soup.
At 12:03 P.M., I heard him yell Ouch!
Then at 12:07, he called Gina into his office.
She entered, holding nothing.
One minute later, she left holding an opaque bag.
Captain Holt's pants were in that bag.
His knees are in the breeze.
He's in his undies.
That evidence is circumstantial.
Oh, so you guys want visual confirmation?
- No.
- Not really.
Done.
Hey, Captain.
I just need you to sign something at my desk real quick.
Just leave it on the couch.
- Dismissed.
- Okay.
Sir, you're gonna freak.
Yo-Yo Ma is in the precinct, and he's giving out autographs.
Yo-Yo Ma is on tour in Australia right now.
How would you know that?
Sir, I'm choking on a lozenge!
I'm gonna die!
- I got you, Jake!
- No, no.
Stop.
I swallowed it.
I swallowed it.
It's fine.
Hey, hey.
I made you another bowl of soup since you spilled yours earlier, but you're gonna have to come over here to get it.
All right, Peralta, I'm sick of you wasting time, so, yes, I spilled some minestrone on my pants, and I'm sitting in my underwear.
Happy?
Yes.
Ah.
Sir, I need you to sign off on look at us, just three people with pants on having a normal conversation.
Yep.
No story here.
Hello, everybody.
In my hands, I hold the driving directions to this year's detectives-only getaway.
Give it a cool name, Jake.
All right, detectives-only getaway d-o-g, dog, dog party Dog Party '15.
Woof, woof, woof!
Big shout-out to Charles Boyle for hosting us at his beach house this year.
Yeah.
You should really thank my ex-wife.
We split it in the divorce.
I get it for December through February.
Winter B-house!
Woof, woof, woof!
Yeah, that's not really catching on.
- Aw.
- As always, there will be no spouses, no bosses, no work No bedtimes, within reason.
All right, Santiago's feeling rowdy.
Who else is feeling it?
I can't wait.
This weekend, I am Vacation Terry.
No kids, no responsibilities.
I'm just a balloon floating in the great blue sky, and I am untethered.
And just to clarify, how untethered is Vacation Terry from his wife?
Very tethered.
All right, anyone else have questions?
Hitchcock, Scully, you've been weirdly silent.
We didn't want to say anything that would get us uninvited.
Smart.
All right, get pumped, people.
Dog Party '15, ooh-ooh!
Two bottles of vodka.
Is this gonna be the weekend we finally meet six-drink Amy?
Six-drink Amy?
What does that mean?
It's the pinnacle of the Santiago drunkenness scale.
One drink, Amy's a little spacey.
Wait.
What?
Two drinks: Loud Amy.
You want to get a cab?
Three drinks: Amy dance pants.
Four-drink Amy is a bit of a pervert.
Hey, check it out.
And five-drink Amy is weirdly confident.
Let's do this, little man.
But I've never seen six-drink Amy.
Maybe she's the one I could actually be friends with, aka my sasquatch.
Hey, there, beautiful.
Marcus, what are you doing here?
I know you lost your phone charger, so I got you a new one, and I want to make sure your phone's all juiced up for some sweet long-distance texting.
Thanks.
What do I owe you?
It's a gift.
All you got to say is thank you.
I said thank you.
That was the first thing I said.
Sorry.
You're nice.
I'll text you.
Can't wait.
Inappropriate work kiss.
Too fast.
Can't stop me.
Rosa D macking down with her boo on the street!
I love it.
Say "boo" again, I will shoot you in the stomach.
Fine.
"Lover boy" it is.
What did I just say, Charles?
- What did I just say?
- You said you said not to say it.
Peralta, I thought you already left.
Yeah, I closed a couple of cases and had to finish up the paperwork.
Also, I wanted to thank you again for giving us this half day.
Yes, of course.
I understand how important these extravaganzas are.
I'm sure you'll have a hoot.
Oh, yeah, although I'm sure our hoots pale in comparison to the hoots that you had back in the day.
I bet things got supes hoots.
Actually, I wasn't privy to those events.
As a gay black detective, I was excluded from most social gatherings.
You guys off to play some golf?
Yeah.
You want to caddy?
No, I do not.
Yeah.
Golf sucks.
I know that wasn't the point of your story.
- Those guys were jerks.
- Yes.
But I do envy the camaraderie they shared.
I've always wanted to Josh around with my peers.
So you've never joshed around with anyone?
Never.
But go have fun with the squad.
Really Josh around for me.
Welcome to chÃ¢teau boy-Al.
Eleanor told me to keep the place clean, but I don't care.
Mommy's out of town, and we're gonna party.
You call your ex-wife mommy?
Not consciously.
This will do just fine.
You brought pineapple?
Well, the fanny runs deep.
I am prepared for any vacation situation.
I've got a bottle opener, sunscreen, inflatable neck pillow.
Wait.
Are we having Fondue?
Tight.
Gina, you ready to party or what?
Don't mind if I oh.
Whoa.
Dang!
Ah!
You're two shots behind, Linetti.
What up, party people?
You know how I'm always saying it ain't a real party till your boss shows up unexpectedly?
Well, it's a party.
What are you talking about?
Hello, party people.
Peralta told me to say that.
Yeah, I did.
Ain't no party like a Captain Holt party 'cause a Captain Holt party is a total surprise to everyone Okay, well, Captain, the only free bedroom is my ex-wife's, which is strictly off-limits.
She locks the door and takes the handle home with her.
All right, you can have my bed.
Charles, I'll take yours.
Problem solved.
I'll sleep on the floor.
Captain, come with me.
What the hell, Jake?
No bosses.
Look, he told me this story about how his squad always excluded him, and I know I come across as a cynical, badass cop with a checkered past and a thirst for I felt bad.
You would've too.
Guys, he just wants to josh around.
Is that so bad?
I am dating his nephew.
Now we're hanging out on weekends?
What is next?
Small talk.
Okay, Amy, you got to be glad that Holt's here, right?
I mean, you're basically in love with him.
I love him.
I'm not in love with him, but I'm definitely not comfortable being drunk around him.
Ames, please keep the volume down, okay?
Sorry.
It's two drinks.
I can't help it.
That's it.
I'm cutting myself off.
So Jake messes up, and you punish me for it?
Come on, Amy.
You're better than that.
You guys, this is gonna be fine.
I mean, Terry's our boss, and he comes with us every year.
Correction: You bring Vacation Terry, and he is no man's boss.
When the slippers are filled, Terry is chilled.
We're happy the captain's here.
Thank you, Scully and Hitchcock, the voice of reason.
Holt's the big fish we've been waiting for.
We have an exciting investment opportunity to pitch him.
- What?
- It's an offshore casino that's currently sunk off the coast of Delaware.
No, all right, you guys are both officially uninvited from this whole weekend.
Too late.
We drove up as a group.
There's no getting rid of us.
- Ah.
- Sorry, Jake.
This weekend's gonna suck.
All right, you know what?
You guys are being a bunch of racist, homophobic golf cops, and I for one think this weekend's gonna be even more fun because Holt is here.
Hey, what are you doing down here?
Lunch is ready.
- I'm texting Marcus.
- Mm.
Texting that's the most intimate thing you can do to a lover with your fingers other than washing their hair.
So I texted Marcus, and he hasn't texted me back.
I can't believe I'm asking this, but can you help me?
Oh, Rosa, yes.
I am the perfect person for this job.
Okay, let's get busy.
What was his initial text?
"I can't believe I miss you this much after three hours, X.O." X.O.?
Girl, marry him.
- What'd you write back?
- "Ha-ha, lame".
It's a joke.
I was insulting him.
You know, flirting.
Think he's mad?
I bet he's heartbroken.
No, no.
We can fix this.
We just have to write a very sweet, very heartfelt text that will jump-start the conversation.
"Hey, baby".
I don't call people "baby".
You do now.
So how do you all typically blow off steam?
Does anyone have any formal complaints about the work environment?
No, no, we usually just gossip, right?
Yeah.
Hey, did everyone see Dave from downstairs this week?
He shaved his beard.
Oh, my God.
His whole face looks like a butt.
Ha-ha, Butt Face Dave.
Butt Face Dave, that's his new name, butt face Dave, 'cause his face looks like a butt.
I like David.
He's a good cop.
- Yeah.
- David is great.
- He's a good dude.
- I like that guy.
I'd like to propose a toast.
- Good idea.
Great idea.
- Mm!
Amy, you don't have a drink?
Oh, no, it's okay.
I don't The captain's making a toast.
Don't be rude, Prude.
Okay, I guess I'll have one more.
You're on vacation.
Who's counting?
I am.
Thank you for inviting me up.
To joshing around together.
- Cheers.
- To joshing!
Joshing.
This is fun.
Ooh, you know what we could do after lunch?
Walk on the beach.
But it's the middle of winter.
Which is ideal, you know?
Not too hot, no crowds.
The sand doesn't get everywhere 'cause it's basically frozen.
Exactly.
Who brought their beach boots?
"I did".
Spot-on Rosa impression.
This is nice.
I mean, the wind is unexpected but welcome and bracing.
Yeah.
It's like a thousand little needles of happiness shooting into your face.
Well, we've been walking for about 20 minutes, so So we should probably turn around in another 20.
Good plan an 80-minute walk on the beach.
I'm so cold.
Even my fiery dance moves aren't keeping me warm.
The trick is, you got to be prepared.
Mini cognac, ladies?
Oh, yeah!
Oh, warm me up, you little bastard.
- Mm.
- Four drinks.
Mm, mm, mm.
Thank you, Terry's fanny.
And thank you, Poseidon, great God of the sea!
What are you wearing?
A T-shirt.
I only brought a bikini.
Seems weird to be in front of the captain in a bathing suit.
Got to cover up them thangs, yeah?
You can still see them through your shirt.
So here we all are, finally relaxing as a squad together in the tub.
It's fun, huh?
I can't hear anyone.
Can we please turn off the jets?
Yeah.
That's better.
No more disturbed water.
Good call.
Wow, without the bubbles, you can really see everything.
Eyes up here, Peralta.
And snip.
Mazel tov.
Captain, I bet you used to smoke cigars on the job all the time, right?
No, but I had a partner who did.
Had one burning all day long.
Dan Hammer.
That name is so cool, it doesn't need a nickname.
Ah, but he had one.
Snake Eyes.
Oh, Snake Eyes is a great one.
Oh, yeah.
He was the toughest son of a bitch I ever met.
When he died, he stuck out his middle finger so he'd be flipping everyone off at his funeral.
- Oh, that rules.
- Yeah.
Who killed him?
Don't say a white tiger on cocaine, 'cause I will lose it.
No, cancer of the mouth, tongue, lip, and cheek.
Hmm.
Well, still, the middle finger thing is cool.
Actually, no one got to see that.
It was closed casket because the doctors had removed so much of his face.
All right, that's that.
All right, I admit it.
It's weird having the captain here.
It straight up sucks.
Should we just go home?
What do you think, Terry?
I am not going anywhere.
I'm playing kwazy kupcakes.
I'm hydrated as hell, and I'm listening to Sheryl Crow.
I've got my own party going on.
Wait a minute.
Vacation Terry, you're a genius.
We'll have two parties, a fun one down here with just us and then an awkward, uncomfortable one in the living room with Holt.
He doesn't even have to know about it.
Separate parties, separate but equal forget I said that phrase.
Ok, we don't have much time.
Captain's in the bathroom, and we all know how efficient he is in there.
Here's the plan: The boring Holt party will be in the living room.
At least three of us must be with him in that room at all times.
It's not a party if there aren't four people.
Especially between the sheets.
The other party will be in here.
Shifts at each party will be 20 minutes and staggered.
Any questions?
How do you get your hair like that?
Born this way also, Hitchcock and Scully are not to be left alone with the captain.
They'll annoy him into leaving his party with their weird sunken casino idea.
It's not an idea.
It's a scheme.
Okay, that is way worse.
I think this is gonna work.
And who knows?
Maybe the Holt party will even be fun.
Now, the recorder is generally thought of as a training instrument for children, but listen to it.
In the hands of an expert like Joram Leifgrum The passion is breathtaking.
Okay, so Marcus wrote, "what you doing right now"?
Then a smiley face blowing a kiss.
Oh, he's good.
We could say, "thinking about you".
Oh, forget it.
That's stupid.
No, Rosa, it's poetry.
Oof.
First shift is done.
- How was it?
- I'm not gonna lie.
It was pretty brutal.
But on the plus side, I now hate a whole new genre of music.
All right, Boyle, Rosa, and Amy, you're up.
Come on, get on it.
And under it.
Bangarang.
Ames, Ames, Ames.
You don't want to be around Holt in your current state.
Say hello to the most confident woman alive.
Gah!
Drink number five You are a true friend and a hot little piece.
Good-bye, four-drink Amy.
Sloppy sicko.
His name is Blair Underwood.
The man I saw in the grocery store was Blair Underwood.
Hey, Ray, it's time.
For what, Detective Santiago?
For you to give me a promotion and a 40% raise.
I've been carrying this squad for two years, and my back's getting tired.
Excuse me, Captain.
Hey, Amy, can I talk to you for one second?
Uh, you just did.
- Burn.
- Ah, so good.
So, listen, I don't think overconfident Amy is working out.
Maybe you should go back downstairs.
Mm, maybe I should just have another drink.
Get ready, America.
Here comes six - Oh, what?
- Okay, that's Wait a minute.
Why is Scully up here?
Hey, Captain.
How much does it cost to raise a sunken ship?
Answer: Less than a casino makes in a year hopefully.
What a funny riddle.
Hey, Scully, there's this sandwich in the other room I want to show you.
- Say no more.
- Oh, that was easy.
What the hell, guys?
You can't just let Scully go wherever he wants.
We lost track of who was where, sorry.
Guys, if we're gonna pull this off, we need to focus.
- You want to play?
- Yeah, I want to play.
It's quarters.
What, am I a monster?
Terry, tag me in.
You're on Holt party duty.
It seems to me all-wheel drive is four-wheel drive.
You need something.
Who needs something?
I know they say it's not good to have a TV in the bedroom, which is why I don't.
I am the king of quarters!
See, I told you guys we'd still have fun this weekend.
Wait, Terry, aren't you supposed to be upstairs?
Not now.
It's schnapps time.
Okay, Amy and Hitchcock are still upstairs.
I think we're still good.
Six-drink Amy is so alone.
Oh, no.
Six-drink Amy isn't fun.
She's just sad.
Damn it.
Guys, this is really bad.
Got to get up there.
Now, where is everyone?
Ah, Detectives.
You were having a party without me.
- Captain - No need to explain.
This is gonna sound controversial, but I think that went pretty good.
Man, I've never seen Captain Holt that upset before.
He looks like a sad block of granite.
What are we gonna do?
How do you cheer up granite?
Well, you could salvage it, much like the casino we've been talk - Seriously, stop.
- I feel awful.
My fanny's not deep enough to fix this.
Vacation Terry - is dead.
- The fanny.
I'm gonna go talk to Captain Holt.
No, don't do that.
I invited him up here.
I should go talk to him.
- Okay.
- What?
Really thought you were gonna fight me on that, and then we'd have a whole back-and-forth, and eventually you'd go, "Jake, I respect you", but I got to do this".
No, it's uncomfortable.
I'd much rather you do it.
All right, fine.
Here I go.
- You're walking in place.
- All right!
Hey, I need to write Marcus back fast.
He's already freaked out by how long it takes me to text him back.
Listen, Rosa, there's nothing I'd rather do in my life than write a sexy text to your boyfriend, but I think this is something you got to do on your own.
Why?
You're so good at being lame, and I'm not.
- Yeah.
- Look, I like him.
I really like him.
I don't want to screw this crap up.
That's what you should say.
Just take that sentiment, remove the word "crap," and then send it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gah, I sent it.
He didn't write back, so he hates it.
No, wait.
Look.
Okay, oh, okay, "dot, dot, dot".
It's happening.
It's a shirtless pic.
We did it.
We did it!
Thanks, Boyle.
Okay, I'm gonna leave.
Don't follow me.
Things are about to get intense.
Makes sense.
Ames.
Gina.
You got to see the sasquatch.
Was it everything you drumpt?
It was the stuff drumps are made of.
Can you hold my eyes still till things stop spinning?
Okay, let's sit you up.
There.
Easy does there oh, there you go.
Now drink this entire glass of water.
You're taking care of me.
Just cause I know you won't remember it.
Mm-mm, no.
You like me.
Six-drink Amy is your friend.
And and she's gonna be very sick right now.
Okay.
I heard you were out here.
Really hate those jets, huh?
I'm not a child.
I don't need a bubble bath.
So listen.
Before you say anything, I want to say I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
Wow, I can't believe I almost made Terry do this.
Apology accepted.
I was so eager to make up for all the joshing around I'd missed, I forgot this getaway is really for you detectives.
And one of the things you're striving to get away from is your captain.
Yeah, I mean, it's nothing against you as a person.
Everyone loves you, but you're our captain, and normally we get really drunk and act like crazy idiots and play stupid games where we make fun of the boss.
Which is hard when the boss is present.
Yeah.
But not impossible.
I think instead of us rising to your level, it's maybe time for you to stoop down to ours.
And that's just the start.
I call the game "Real Ray or Fake Ray"?
And joining us is a very special contestant, Captain Ray Holt himself.
All right, here's how the game works.
I will say a phrase.
You tell me if I made it up or if it's something that Captain Holt actually said in real life to an actual human being.
I understand the logic of this game.
Great!
Phrase number one: "The futility of lighting candles only to blow them out immediately is just one reason I find children's birthday parties impractical".
- Holt.
- That's Holt.
Mm, fake.
I say fake too.
I don't remember saying it, so it must be fake.
It was real!
Oh!
To Terry's kids at their birthday party.
Oh, I remember now.
Oh, do another one.
Do another one.
All right, phrase number two: "Any smile that lasts longer than a second and a half is a con man's ruse".
That's fake.
That's a fake one.
I said it.
And I meant it!
Oh!
Not a doctor.
Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hey, Boyle, I need a recommendation for a good restaurant.
It's Marcus' birthday and I want to do something Nice.
Ooh.
Do you want like, classic, romantic?
- Or gastro-sensuous?
- Ugh.
Never mind.
I know those categories.
You guys are talking dates.
Here's what you do: Invite him over, order some fancy take out, throw it in a pot, and act like you cooked it.
I got the idea from yahoo!
Answers.
Dude, I'm not gonna buy a pot.
We're not married.
Mm-kay, you know what time it is?
Because my hoodie does.
Look at that.
Mm.
I have either two or four words for you.
Drag queen.
Dim sum.
You're talking about this friday night?
Everything's gonna be booked.
We're only 72 hours out and we're still in the brainstorming phase?
You gotta postpone.
You can't postpone a birthday, Amy.
But, if you can't get a reservation, you can always go home and shampoo his hair.
Please stop always recommending that.
Well, it's always romantic.
You can go to the top of the empire state building, that's every romantic.
Hm.
Maybe I will.
You can pee on the whole city from up there.
Come on!
What?
Come on!
Take it.
Take it.
Come on!
This stupid machine won't take my dollar.
That's half a dollar taped to a pizza coupon.
It's good for a cheesy bread worth $2.50.
You would've made money on this deal, machine.
Hey, sarge, can I borrow a dollar?
No.
No more loans.
You already owe me way too much.
The bank of Terry is closed.
What, are you sailing away on a tugboat?
Man, I love tugboats.
It's not a tugboat!
I'm locking the vault!
All right, fine, how much could I possibly owe you?
$2,437.
Dollars?
Wait, of course dollars, why was that the part I was surprised by?
Jake, I would appreciate it if you paid me back.
Well, that's the craziest thing anyone's ever said to me.
"I would appreciate it if you paid me back"?
Good.
So you heard it too.
I've been in debt to him forever and he's never cared before.
Something's up.
I'm gonna drop everything and figure out why he's acting weird.
Or you could just pay him what you owe.
Hilarious, Rosa.
Hilarious.
Santiago, whenever you can, please drop of those case files.
You got it, partner!
Be right in!
"Partner"?
What is going on?
Is this a make-a-wish thing?
Are you dying?
Is it from loneliness?
I found a mistake in one of the Captain's old cases and he asked me to work it with him.
As partners.
We're taking our relationship to the next level.
From awkward underling to awkward colleague.
This is a real ugly duckling story.
We're gonna bounce ideas off each other, eat street meat while we stake-out some perp, bond over burned coffee Santiago!
Hm?
Now means now!
You got it.
See?
He can't wait to work with me.
He's clearly pumped.
Hello, Terry.
I just thought I'd stop by and let you know that I'm on my way to the bank.
That's right.
I'm gonna pay you back because I know your secret.
What are you talking about?
I don't have a secret.
Oh, really?
Fact the first: After years of not caring about my debt, you weirdly want me to pay you back now.
That implies to me that there is a sudden, unexpected expense.
Or I got sick of waiting for you to do the right thing.
Not plausible.
You have endless patience for my shenanigans.
Fact the second: You've had dentist appointments twice in the past two weeks.
No one goes to the dentist that much.
I haven't been in seven years.
You should go to the dentist, Jake.
Probably.
My teeth hurt all the time.
Fact the third: I'm really liking this "fact the" thing.
I think I'm gonna stick with it.
Fact the fourth: I found this on your desk.
It's a list of names.
Nathaniel Jeffords, Alexa Jeffords Those are my cousins names.
Lies!
There is but one conclusion.
You, Terry Jeffords, are pregnant.
The names are baby names.
The dentist?
An obstetrician.
And the money is for baby things.
Like diapers.
What are you talking about, man?
Yeah.
That is crazy.
Yeah.
Damn it!
Does anybody else know?
No, just you, and your wife, and crash.
That's what I think you should name the baby.
Works for a boy or a girl.
Listen up, Jake.
We just found out Sharon is pregnant and it's way too early to tell anyone.
This is a secret.
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah.
Do you?
Do you understand me?
Oh, this got physical very quickly.
This is adult stuff, Jake.
Be serious!
Look, I promise I won't tell anyone, all right?
My lips are sealed.
Good.
Do I even weigh anything to you?
No.
It's like holding a couple of grapes.
Okay, partner, let's bang this out.
Should we grab a cup of coffee, bounce some theories off each other I solved it already.
Oh Then should we grab a cup of coffee, you could tell me what you found out and No, we can do it here.
The fires were set by Richard Wilcox, the firefighter who was first on the scene at all three fires.
Okay uh, now we just have to work backwards, figure out why He was up for a promotion and wanted to look like a hero.
Yup.
But how are we gonna find this bastard?
After all these years, you know, it could take He owns a store.
I have the address.
Okay.
I could drive.
No, you don't know where we're going.
But if you'd like a cup of coffee, there's an old bakery in that neighborhood.
The coffee there is terrible but I would enjoy the nostalgia.
I love terrible coffee.
Now let's put away Richard Wilcox, that no-good punk.
He's 86 years old.
You don't outgrow punk, sir.
There you are, sergeant.
Installment one of TBD.
I have.
You should also note it's all in singles because it takes so many bills to fill up a briefcase.
Thanks, Peralta.
You know, it's nice to finally have someone to share this secret with.
I'm pregnant, man!
Yeah!
We're pregnant.
"We" because I convinced you not to get a vasectomy.
So if it wasn't for me, you'd have no penis.
You still don't know what a vasectomy is.
Hey, so listen, I was thinking, now that I've proven I'm fiscally responsible, how you feel about me being the godfather?
How about this?
You don't tell anyone about the pregnancy for four weeks, and I'll think about you being the godfather.
Yes!
Oh also, I put a list of baby names in there.
Nakatomi.
After the tower in Die Hard.
Works for a boy or a girl.
What's going on?
How'd you get all that money?
Pfft, by putting bad guys behind bars.
I work for a living, jeez.
I emptied out my checking account.
Wait, you've owed Terry for years, and now, suddenly, you give him every penny you have?
- Why?
- Why?
Oh, wait.
Because.
That is not an answer.
No.
Well, because you guys got in my head about owing Terry money.
And it convinced me that it's important to pay back your friends.
Well, you owe all of us money.
So does that mean you're gonna pay all of us back?
Yeah, Jake, or is there something special about your friendship with Terry?
Nope.
Nothing special about Terry.
I'm gonna pay everyone.
Man, I really hoped to say this to a drug dealer who killed my whole family, but It's payback time.
All right, but a nice little dent into my Terry debt.
No applause?
Seriously?
Okay, I see how this is gonna be.
All right, how much do I owe the rest of you?
$4,009.
What?
How is that even possible?
June 3rd, 2008, paid for your lunch, $8.45.
June 3rd, 2008, bought you a soda, $1.05.
June 3rd, 2008, lent you $4,000 for an entertainment system.
Now there it is.
I stopped keeping track after that.
Sure.
Sure, okay.
How about the rest of you?
$856.32 okay, very specific.
I'm sorry you guys, but I can't pay that.
It's too much money.
Why don't you just take back the money you gave to Terry and split it six ways.
Then at least everyone gets something.
Yeah, but Terry needs the money.
For what?
Uh, for butt enhancement surgery.
Smart.
That's a real problem area for Terry.
Yeah.
What?
What?
I am not having butt enhancement surgery.
Nor do I need it!
Okay, so split up the money.
No, no, no.
How about this?
I'll work off my debt to each of you.
How's that sound?
I'll do anything you want.
Anything?
Am I the only one that was super creeped out by that?
No, that was definitely creepy.
Yeah, he wants you to do something real weird.
Hello, partner!
Two coffees.
Black for me.
Milk for you.
You remembered how I like it!
Yes, with milk.
It's just one ingredient.
And you remembered it.
Mm.
Anyway, no sign of Wilcox.
Maybe we should talk about deets of the case, plan our next move, grab a little chow.
No need.
I brought these.
Nutrition bricks.
Hm?
I have original no-flavor and whole wheat no-flavor.
Nutrition bricks sound great.
Or we could grab a little street meat.
Kind of a classic stakeout food, but whatever.
Huh.
Meat.
From the street.
Sounds like a fun treat.
I'm a poet and didn't even know I was rhyming those words.
But it happened anyway.
That's a great idea, partner.
Let's grab some street meat.
Okay!
How's working your debt off going?
Horrible.
Rosa's making clean her motorcycle.
Payback's a bitch.
Ugh!
So many great payback lines wasted on this.
Damn this bike's muddy.
And this isn't even the worst thing I had to do.
Gina made me call people and tell them she was dead to see how they'd react.
Is she crying?
Is she crying?
A little.
You should be wailing, you stone cold bitch.
Now call my other grandma.
And then there was Scully.
Lower.
Lower.
I'm at your butt.
Lower!
Apparently he holds his stress in the b-cheeks.
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
Well, at least I can help you out.
No, no, no, no.
That'll only make people suspicious.
Besides, I don't mind doing all these horrible things, 'cause I want to keep your secret safe.
For you, and Sharon, and Miata.
Works for a boy or a girl.
Well, well, well, what are you hens clucking about?
What?
Nothing.
What do you want, Boyle?
To be paid back.
I want you to wash my dogs.
Hm, why would I ask that given that I know you hate my dogs?
They hump everything.
They're passionate!
But you don't have to wash them at all if you just tell me what's going on here.
You two have a secret.
I can smell it.
Jason, not now.
Down.
Yuck.
We don't have a secret, all right?
Do we have a secret, Terry?
If we did, it's a secret from me.
Okay then, wash my dogs.
And be warned, they just watched Peabody and Sherman, so they're extra horny.
Ah!
Jason!
Wait your turn!
I must say, this is quite good.
Is this sauce for your chicken or my lamb?
Hm.
I don't know.
Should we try it?
Let's risk it.
Here we go.
Boom.
It's amazing.
I don't care for it.
But I tried!
And what a story for Kevin!
So who was your partner back when you caught the Brooklyn broiler?
Martin Ormankupp.
He was a great partner.
Smart, loyal, homophobic but not racist.
In those days, that was pretty good.
Hm.
How long did you work the case for?
Martin Ormankupp and I tracked him for eight months.
Almost cost him his marriage to his wife, Heather Ormankupp.
Oh, sir, look!
Oh, this could be our man.
Let's go.
NYPD.
We're partners.
We'd like to ask you some questions.
You're not Richard Wilcox!
That's my grandpa.
He died a couple weeks ago.
I'm just here cleaning out his shop.
Oh, no.
Something wrong here.
Oh, you think this punk is lying, partner?
No.
Something's wrong in my intestine.
Due to the street meat.
- We must go now.
- Okay.
Oh, okay.
All right, I'll drive!
Oh, my Sir, we could find a public bathroom.
No!
This is a very private emergency!
Ah!
I'm going to the gym, then Sharon is gonna take me to a dentist appointment.
Damn sarge, your teeth are messed up.
Listen up, everybody.
I just forwarded you an email about the suspect in those bodega robberies.
Check it out.
We're gonna catch this guy.
All right, let's see here.
Hurricane?
Hurricane Jeffords.
Works for a boy or a girl.
I know what's going on Jake.
Uh, what?
About who?
With you and Terry.
The money, the private convos.
I figured it out.
You stole my idea to open a bowling alley and you're gonna do it with Terry.
Yup, that's it.
Jake.
Fingerholes was our idea.
I do not think it should be called fingerholes.
You're not calling it fingerholes?
Good luck, pal.
Oh, my God!
Terry's pregnant?
What?
How do you know that?
We all know.
You hit "reply all" on the email, grandma Peralta.
Oh, no.
Uh, good.
Great.
The secret is out.
I got humped by Jason for nothing.
Okay, yes.
Terry is having another kid.
We are pregnant.
But that's a secret.
It's way too soon to tell anyone.
I only stumbled across it 'cause I'm such an amazing Detective.
Who accidentally hit "reply all" like some idiot on a brunch thread.
Yeah, that.
But, look, Terry can't know the secret is out.
He got the email too, boo.
Crap, you're right.
All right, we just have to break into his email account and delete the message while he's down at the gym.
Great, all right, here's the plan.
I'll go down there What are you gonna do, Jake?
I'm obviously about to say.
Okay?
I'll go down there Sorry, Jake, I thought it was a call and response.
It's not.
Okay?
I'll go down there Are you mad at me?
Dude!
Okay?
Here's the plan.
I'll go down to the gym and have Terry take me through his workout.
You guys get savant from I.T. to help you hack into his account.
If anything goes wrong, Scully, fake a heart attack.
What are you thinking?
Classic angina, or something sexier, like um, myocardial infarction?
Just drop down onto the ground and wiggle.
I'm gonna nail this.
You're back so soon.
Did you catch your guy?
No, he was dead.
So I'll never catch him.
Also, Amy bought us tainted meat and now I have diarrhea.
Oof.
Hey, Terry.
You get my email?
About how I was coming down here?
No, I haven't checked my phone.
Oh, no need.
I just wanted to make sure you were here, you know?
You know how I like to have a weight-mate.
Really?
I have never seen you in the gym.
What?
I basically live here.
I'm a regular gym dandy.
Besides, I gotta get into shape for all the godfathering I'm gonna do.
I mean, how am I gonna throw our baby up into the air with these noodle arms?
Good point.
So take me through your workout, man.
Rip me up, you know?
Let's rip it out.
Time to rip it down!
Those aren't gym terms.
And I don't think you could handle my workout.
Oh, wow.
Sounds like a challenge to me.
Come on.
I got you.
Ready?
Yup.
Oh, my God!
So heavy!
This will crack his password, but it could take an hour.
No way Jake keeps up with Terry for that long.
Have you seen Terry?
Well there's nothing we can do.
Unless you can guess the sarge's password.
"Big muscles"?
Nope.
That's your first guess?
"Big muscles"?
Try his wife's name, Sharon.
Nope.
Sharon1.
Nope.
Sharon2.
Nope.
Sharon3.
Nope.
This is stupid.
Come on!
Push it!
Push it!
Five!
Ah!
Oh, man.
This is almost too easy.
Are you crying?
No.
That's eyeball sweat.
All right.
Let's wrap this up.
I gotta call Sharon and get back to work.
No, no, no, no.
Hey, I thought you said this was gonna be a challenge, huh?
This has been a cakewalk so far.
Oh, you want me to make this harder?
Yes.
That is what I want.
More harder exercise.
Look, sarge!
I've burnt 200 calories.
That's your heart rate.
Yeah.
That checks out.
Come on, Jack, ten more minutes.
I think we should stop now, Peralta.
No, no.
I'm still good.
Check this out.
Right hook, right hook, uppercut.
My arms don't seem to be responding to my brain anymore.
Nope.
Ugh!
God, I hate how hard it is to guess other people's passwords.
Wait!
Everyone, wait!
Try "yogurt".
We're in!
Terry loves yogurt.
Come on, Jake!
Let's go!
So how much blood do you usually have in your mouth when you do this?
None.
Great, I'm done.
Great workout, sarge.
Ah, Boyle, I need to throw away this piece of paper but I can't move my body.
On it, Jakey.
It's show time, here we go.
I love this, we're like Batman and Alfred.
You'd rather be Alfred than Robin?
He has access to the batcave, plus, he gets to drive all of Batman's girlfriends home and dish.
Doy.
Oh, hey!
How are you Mrs. Sarge?
You look normal.
Hi, Jake.
Charles.
Uh, hold on, honey.
I gotta check my emails and then I'll be ready to go.
Okay, all set.
All right, have fun.
Yeah.
Sergeant Jeffords.
Sharon.
The Captain's back?
When he get back?
Turn me around!
I'm not feeling well.
I have an appointment at the restroom but I gather congratulations are in order.
For what?
Oh, Peralta sent everyone in the office an email about what to name your new baby.
For what it's worth, I really like the name Todd.
Terrence, what is he talking about?
Yeah, Peralta!
What is he talking about?
Hey.
Scully!
Now!
Oh, no!
He's having a heart attack!
This is a man's life, you calloused bastards!
Terry, I am so sorry.
You should be sorry.
Should I get out of here or should I just fade into the background until you need me to wheel you out?
I'll fade.
I'll fade.
You promised you wouldn't tell anyone.
I know, but I can't help it if everyone in this precinct is a brilliant Detective.
You emailed them all!
With your email!
To their emails!
Okay, yes, that was one fact that may have helped them crack the case, but Boyle was closing in.
I was actually way off.
All my theories were bowling alley related.
Fading, fading again.
Look, I know I messed up.
But it was an honest mistake.
I promise you, I was taking it seriously.
What was the email you sent everyone about?
How you should name your kid hurricane.
Wheel him out, Charles.
Wait.
Does this mean I can't be the godfather?
I said wheel him out.
You can be my godfather, Jake.
You're older than me!
Captain?
How are you feeling?
Better today.
I even managed to eat some plain toast this morning.
Smart.
Something bland.
That's my favorite breakfast.
Right.
Sir, I'm sorry.
I wanted to be a great partner.
A Martin Ormankupp.
But instead, I was the partner who made you sick.
Can I tell you something about Martin Ormankupp?
On our second day as partners, Martin Ormankupp was kicked in the crotch by a police horse.
Not what I was expecting you to say.
Of all the cases that we worked, that moment was the one that bonded us the most.
Because that's what we laughed about.
After his surgery and months long rehab.
It was a terrible ordeal for both Martin and Heather Ormankupp.
Mm.
So you think we can laugh about me poisoning you?
Yes, I do.
Someday.
Perhaps over street meat.
Sir, did you just laugh?
Uproariously.
Oh, my God.
It's happening.
Yup.
Here, sarge.
It's the rest of the money I owe you.
I thought you already drained your bank account.
I sold my car.
It's not a big deal.
Oh, my God!
This is such a huge deal!
I can't un-tell your secret.
The best I can do is make sure no one talks about it for the next four weeks and pay back your money, so.
Jake, hold up.
Yeah?
I was wondering if you still wanted to be the godfather.
Wait, seriously?
Yes!
Of course!
That would be amazing.
Thank you.
I'm gonna be such a good godfather.
You'll see.
I'm gonna be like "What's the matter with you?
Be a man"!
You know?
You know, obviously I wouldn't scream that at the baby.
That was a bad quote to choose.
But you get what I'm saying.
Yeah, look, that kid is gonna have a lot of fun hanging out with you.
But I also know that if anything happened to me and Sharon, you're responsible enough to raise the little guy.
Wait, that's what a godfather does?
I mean, I knew that.
I can handle it!
Just real quick, what's a good book on parenting that you could recommend.
Or better yet, what's a good movie on parenting?
Terry?
Seriously, I have no idea what to do!
Oh, wait!
Yahoo!
Answers.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Ant.
Ant.
Ant.
Ant.
Ant.
God, they're everywhere.
Are we sure that we've cleaned up all the food and crumbs?
Why is everyone looking at us?
We're the ones who eat up all the crumbs.
Yeah, we're the solution.
Well, there are no ants on my desk because I sanitize it daily.
What do you call that?
Ah!
Those are your ants!
They're using a monitor cable as a land bridge.
Now they're destroying our technology.
This is an invasion.
They're in my yogurt.
Now it's personal.
All right, that's it.
We have gotta fight back.
This is our planet!
Just use Boyle's cologne.
It's repulsive to everything.
Ah!
Not cool.
You're going to Penn Station to buy me a new one.
The ant infestation?
It's bad.
They bite now, sir.
I think they're just trying to avoid the cold weather.
We should freeze them out.
The plan is working, Captain.
Yes.
We won.
Oh my God.
They're in the coats.
They're in our coats!
Okay.
I don't want Sophia to know that I'm waiting for her, so Should we pretend to have a heated argument that I win?
Oh, or better yet: a physical contest that I win.
What's going on?
I thought things were good with you and Sophia.
Jake.
Did you do something dumb?
That's a really good question, but actually no, I don't think so.
It's just been a little weird lately.
She's acting kind of distant.
Have you talked to her?
No, I don't want to seem desperate.
Talking to her is desperate?
Well, it's not breezy.
Jake?
Hey.
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?
Oh, just arguing about America.
Did you know that the Sarge doesn't think we should have given women the right to vote?
That is not true.
Oh, sure, you say that now that she's here.
But, hey, now that we've accidentally bumped into each other, what are you doing tonight?
You want to hang out?
Oh, I can't.
I have that event for The Association of The Brooklyn Public Defenders Remember, you called it "Satan's Charity Ball, colon, Rise of the Demons"?
Oh yeah.
Defense attorneys are monsters.
Oh.
Uh, except for you.
No, you're fine.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Right, right.
But I have a minute right now.
You want to go take a walk in the park?
Oh, a walk in the park.
How romantic.
And I know where all the murder spots are.
Oh.
Do you want to see them or avoid them?
The choice is yours, m'lady.
Terry, don't wait up.
It's 10:00 A.M. Yep.
Deputy Chief Wuntch is here to see you.
Oh, please stay, Diaz.
I need a witness in case her head starts spinning around or if she turns into a she-wolf.
Hello, Raymond.
No flaccid rejoinder?
Hmm.
What's going on?
I'm here on important business.
I'm a frontrunner for a job in the Boston PD.
Boston?
But it's so close to Salem.
You do know what they do to witches up there, don't you?
This is amazing.
The job is Chief of Police.
I see.
So you've come to brag.
No.
The only blemish on my record is our long history of interpersonal turbulence.
The Boston Commissioner would like to speak with you about it.
I've come to ask for your help.
The commissioner will be calling you.
Wait.
Shh shh shh shh shh shh shh.
Oh.
Moment savored.
So, where were we?
Ah yes, you were talking about how I hold your fate in the palm of my hand.
Oopsie.
Oh my God.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I lost my balance.
You think I'm bothered by a little spilled milkshake?
I'm a food blogger, I'm stained all over.
Okay, what is going on with you two?
Well, you know how our parents have been tender-sexing each other?
Ew.
Precisely, Amy.
Ew.
Boyle and I made a pact to break them up, and now this sticky little gummy bear is backing out.
Look, I know you don't want our lives intertwined, but things have changed.
My father want to marry your mom.
So you choose your dad over me, your coworker who hates you.
Papa's a gentleman.
He won't propose until he gets Gina's blessing And she won't give it to him.
Who says "papa"?
Are you a little French boy?
Oh ho-ho-ho.
I think maybe I can help.
I took a seminar on conflict resolution and I have been waiting weeks to bust this bad boy out.
New binder smell.
Mm-mm.
Amy don't do this.
I'm gonna throw a milkshake in your face.
This is nice.
I feel like old people.
Should we sit here?
Jake, there's something I want to talk to you about.
So, my boss hasn't been assigning me any of the good cases, and I found out it's because I'm dating a cop.
What?
Did he actually say that?
No, but my colleagues did.
You know, everybody I work with think of cops as the enemy.
That's crazy.
They're the enemy.
I see what you mean.
Jake, I really like you, but my job's really important to me, too.
Can we press pause on this?
Press pause?
Just until I figure out what to do with my boss.
Is that okay?
So this is just about your boss?
Okay.
Yes, let's press pause.
Let's pause the hell out of this.
Let's pause this like I pause Jamie Lee Curtis in Trading Places.
I haven't seen that movie, but I'm assuming she's naked.
Mm-hmm.
"Pause" seems bad, Jake.
Why aren't you more upset?
Because Sophia's problem isn't with me, it's with her dumb boss.
That's something I can fix.
I'm gonna make him like me.
Here is the target Geoffrey Hoytsman.
Now, according to the internet, his interests are: skiing, his terrier, Atlantic City, the film 12 Years a Slave, and nature.
Obviously nature is super boring, and the slave film is a little bit dicey.
It's real dicey.
Yeah.
So I will focus mainly on skiing and Atlantic city when I talk to him tonight at the fundraiser for The Association of Brooklyn Public Defenders, A.K.A. The Chamber of Asses.
No, wait.
That's too sexy.
The Chamber of Snakes.
Anyway, it starts at 8:00, so you should probably get dressed.
What?
I am not going to that.
Please, Sarge.
Just come.
Do it for me.
Do it for love.
Damn, Jake.
You know Terry loves love.
I'm in.
All right!
Now put on your phoniest smile 'cause we're going into the belly of the beast.
Phonier.
Phonier!
Ah, there it is.
Into the beast!
I go to work I go to work All of our worst enemies are here.
Brown hair guy.
Pony tail lady.
Asian Don Cheadle.
I refuse to learn their names because it humanizes them.
But you'll never forget their smug lawyer faces.
Each one brings back a specific, horrible memory.
Like courtroom PTSD.
Incompetent!
Idiot!
Mint?
I could have choked on that mint Even the nice ones are psychopaths.
All right.
Let's get fired up.
Pound on my shoulders.
That's my stuff.
Wait!
Wait!
No, don't hurt me!
Ah, that was a bad idea.
I'll bang my own sulders.
Let's go.
Detective, have a seat.
I am grappling with a highly vexing conundrum.
What to do about Deputy Chief Wuntch?
Precisely.
I could torpedo her promotion.
Just saying it brims my soul with joy.
But to do so would mean would mean that she stays here in New York City hanging over me like an albino bat.
On the other hand, if I "praise" Wuntch, she will leave this city, the clouds will part, and the children will sing "Wuntch is gone".
What children?
All the children.
Right.
That was a stupid question.
What was Sarge's advice?
Oh, you and I both know what Mother Jeffords would say.
"Take the high road".
But I asked you, Detective Diaz, because you understand vengeance.
Yes, I do.
I had a nemesis once: Carla Bianchi.
Mm.
She wronged me, and I crushed her like a gnat between my fingers.
I got her suspended from the second grade.
Second grade?
That little turd hoarded all the good markers.
But eventually, she came back to school.
And she made the next ten years of my life miserable.
It's not worth it.
Be nice to Wuntch.
"Be nice to Wuntch"?
You may go now, Mother Diaz.
I hate this.
Everyone is looking at us.
Only because we're equally massive, beautiful men in tuxes.
Yeah.
Sophia.
Heeeeeeey, girlfriend.
That came out saucier than I was expecting.
Yeah.
Hey, Jake, What are you doing here?
I thought we agreed to press pause.
We did.
I'm not here to see you.
I'm here to see your boss, Geoffrey Hoytsman.
We're gonna bond.
Oh, God.
Oh, good indeed.
You misheard me on purpose.
Possibly.
Look, I'm gonna charm him.
He's going to start giving you the good cases again.
This is gonna work.
No, it's not.
How can I explain this?
Oh, Okay.
Imagine this room is full of super-intelligent robots Oh.
Hell-bent on ending humanity, and you are a working-class human who just entered their swarm-hive.
Okay, love this, love you, keep going.
Oh, that's a really weird moment to say you love me for the first time.
Oh no.
Was it?
I'm just gonna blow past that.
Yeah.
Look, the point is, you can't charm robots.
So you should go before they pod you and harvest your brain.
Look, I've done my research on Hoytsman: Skiing, nature, Atlantic City, I'm ready for him.
Sophia.
Sergeant Jeffords.
Detective Peralta.
Please, my friends call me Jakey Snowpants, because I'm skiing so much.
Carving moguls on a black diamond.
I prefer cross-country skiing.
It's not a sport if gravity does the work for you.
Yeah.
Gravity sucks.
Not the movie, the theory.
Anyway, I've been spending most of my weekends in Atlantic City these days.
Oh, that place is a dump.
No.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to steal Sophia away.
You can't charm the robots.
What in the frig was that?
He's always in Atlantic City.
Why would he go someplace he hates so much?
Unless there was something there he loves.
I bet he loves gambling.
Just like I'm here in this dump because of Sophia, who I now love.
You're really going hard on this love thing.
Well, I said it out loud.
It's on the record.
I can't take it back Just get on board, Terry.
Hello, Gina.
Ah!
What are you creeps doing?
You made me look away from my phone.
You better pray I didn't miss a text.
In your two seconds you looked away?
All of them important.
Amy suggested we negotiate terms, so if you agree to give my dad his blessing, here's what I'll do for you.
"You will never see me in my pajamas on a family trip.
"We will never share a bunk bed.
"And I won't force you to participate in our annual themed Christmas cards".
This year my dad was Mary and I was the baby Jesus.
Yeah, I know.
Got one.
Lived the nightmare.
Well, the list goes on.
I signed it.
Amy notarized it.
I'm a notary.
No big deal.
I met the comptroller.
Okay, you know what?
This isn't about out lives getting intertwined, okay?
I'm actually worried about my mom 'cause she's been hurt before.
This is all moving way too fast.
Wow.
Gina.
That's really sweet.
And the only reason I didn't tell you guys is 'cause I don't value you as people, so it's, like, why be honest?
Yeah, you just went back and ruined what you said.
Right.
Mm-hmm.
Look, I know I'm a stage five player, just mowing down chicks left and right, but my dad's not like that.
He would never hurt your mom.
Just talk to him, you'll see.
Fine.
I'll talk to him.
Just to ask him some questions.
But go get him before I change my mind.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
I already changed my mind.
Aww.
All right, I'm back.
Oh.
Oh.
I'm back.
After that, the judge just threw it out on the spot.
That judge has a deep voice, right?
I'm gonna go, uh, check out the food.
Hey.
Bet you five buck you can't guess three of the hors d'oeuvres they're serving.
I'll take that action.
Chicken satay, tuna tartare, shot glasses of gazpacho.
Satay, tartare no 'szpach.
Where the 'szpach, Hoytsman?
Yes!
'Szpach!
No!
Well played.
Unless you want to go double or nothing.
I'm listening.
Oh, nothing but glass!
I'll bet you can't tell how tall the Sarge is.
In eggrolls.
Exactly 25 eggrolls tall.
Celebration eggroll.
Hey, man, that was on the floor.
You're on the floor.
remove one glass without knocking the whole thing over.
You didn't say I couldn't grab the top one.
Yes!
from the roof and survive.
Oh, I don't think you can Just messing with you, Peralta.
I gotta hit the head.
Oh, then we'll bet on who can shove more shrimp in his mouth.
You're on.
I got a big mouth though.
You're in trouble.
I thought you were leaving.
Were you just talking to Hoytsman?
Talking.
Bonding.
Betting.
Oh, I should bet him that I can pee for longer than he can.
Ugh.
The trick is to pinch it.
All right.
I'll be right back.
Oh.
Gotta fill up the tank.
Ah!
Hello Geoffrey.
Hello.
And that's cocaine.
This night is making me incredibly anxious.
Oh hey, Stay close.
Someone messed with the champagne tower.
You're all I've got.
Jake is stupid, but he's smart.
I think his plan is actually working.
Oh God.
Hey, so, No big deal, but I arrested your boss, and I never should have come here.
Well I read that wrong.
Oh, this is insane.
This is so insane.
I wasn't doing anything.
He was snorting cocaine in the bathroom.
Okay, for the last time, that is not what happened.
And that's cocaine.
Are you sure?
Five dollars says you're wrong.
Let me get in there.
Take a good look and smell.
No, don't.
Okay.
It was cocaine.
Turns out I was accidentally doing some cocaine.
Not on accident.
You put it in your nose on purpose.
I don't even think I have a nose, Peralta.
I certainly cannot feel it.
The defense rests!
Shh.
Keep your voices down.
What is going on here?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Sophia's cop boyfriend is arresting me in front of my friends and colleagues.
Hey, everyone.
I'm Jake.
So who here saw 12 Years A Slave?
Best picture.
Well, Diaz, the deed is done.
You torpedoed her promotion?
Sadly, no.
I gave that goblin a good recommendation.
Your story about the marketer really hit me.
I began to realize that if even you thought I should take the high road, that was probably the right choice.
I'm sorry you didn't get your vengeance.
Mother Holt.
Good one.
But I am still planning to get some retribution.
I got her a parting gift.
Tickets to Wicked?
In Boston.
She's moving to a second-class city, and I wanted to rub her nose in it.
Enjoy the understudies, Madeline.
Have fun watching some chubby Chenoweth knock-off warble her way through Popular.
Hello, Lynn.
Hi, Regina.
Don't play games with me, boy.
This is a bad idea.
No, it's okay.
Dad's got this.
He's a real sweet talker.
Let's cut the crap.
Okay.
What are your intentions with my mother?
To make love to her every morning until we die.
So it's just physical?
What are you nuts?
I'm a divorced, retired florist with a terrible gluten allergy.
Your mom is a beautiful, brilliant travel agent.
She talks to people on the phone who've seen the whole world.
I'll never meet anyone half as good as her.
She's the best thing that ever happened to me.
You mean other than Charles?
No.
She's the best thing that ever happened to me.
That's okay, Pop.
You did what you had to do.
I love her.
All I want is to make her happy forever.
Fine.
I give you my blessing.
But if you hurt my mom in any way, so help me God, I will cut off your son's testicles.
Snip, snip, snip.
And I'm not playing.
Deal.
Way to go, Dad!
You bagged a babe.
The Boyle boys are planning a wedding!
Boyle boys!
Boyle boys!
Both: Boyle boys!
Boyle boys!
Both: You screwed this up, buddy.
You thinks she's gonna still love you after this?
She'll see who you are now.
Hey, you don't know anything about me and Sophia.
What?
I'm talking to myself about my wife.
She is not gonna like this.
Who cares about you and your gross life?
Jake, heads up.
Oh, hey, Sophia.
Thank God you're here.
I was just gonna find you so we could talk.
Jake, I'm not here to talk to you.
I'm here as Geoffrey's attorney.
Oh, I can do it myself.
Watch this.
Objection, objection, objection, objection, objection!
Five!
Five objections.
Maybe this "cocaine" isn't so bad after all.
Okay.
Geoffrey, I'm gonna have to advise you to stop talking/confessing in front of the detectives.
Okay, look, I know that you're mad, but I talked to the D.A. and he agreed to drop the charges.
Geoffrey just had to do a little bit of community service, and nothing will even go on his record.
Not good enough.
You have no evidence.
Sophia, there's cocaine on his collar right now.
Oh, not anymore.
Whoo!
You're really not reading the vibe right at all.
Tell you what, that's the cocaine.
I'm usually very tuned in.
Shh.
I had to arrest him.
I had no choice.
Really?
'Cause I could think of 50 other ways you could've handled this scenario.
Oh my God, you are such a lawyer.
You are such a cop.
I tell you I need some space to figure things out and you come kicking down the door with the first plan that pops into your head.
How is it my fault that your jerk boss put his jerk nose into a pile of jerk cocaine?
You followed him into a bathroom at a party you weren't even invited to.
Hey, you know what?
We're done.
All right, fine.
I'll talk to the D.A. I'll see if I can cut the community service in half, how's that?
No, Jake.
Not with the case.
You and I are done.
Jake, what are you doing?
I wanted to stop you.
Grand gesture.
I took the stairs.
A little winded there, buddy?
Yeah.
Romance is hard!
Can you just talk for, like, 20 minutes while I catch my breath?
I don't have anything to say.
Oh come on.
This is just a stupid fight about nothing.
I'm not gonna let us break up over this.
Jake, our jobs are incompatible.
Our lives are incompatible.
Look, we'll just never talk about work, or interact with each other's friends, or acknowledge each other in public, and I know this sounds like I'm describing enemies, but we can make this work.
We're Romeo and Juliet.
It didn't work for Romeo and Juliet.
That play ends in a tragic double suicide.
That's how it ends?
Why do people like it so much?
All right, look.
Jake, you're fun, okay?
And we've only been dating for three months.
It's just not that serious.
Well, it's kinda serious to me.
I've accidentally said, "I love you," like, four times already.
I know.
I- I just don't think I accidentally love you back.
Look, it's just it's just so much work.
That's work I'm willing to do.
I'm not.
I'm sorry.
Double suicide?
Hello, Madeline.
Raymond.
I was just about to call you.
I wanted to thank you for your kind recommendation.
And I wanted to give you this.
Wicked.
Starring Beth Danube.
Well played, Raymond.
Sadly, I won't be able to use them.
Since I'm not going to Boston.
What?
I was only interested in the Boston offer as leverage.
I used it to get a promotion from the NYPD.
I have never had more power over you than I do at this very moment.
I wanted to give you these as a thank you.
You're joking.
I'm gonna call the commissioner.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
I know you never would have recommended me for that Boston post if deep down you didn't think I deserved the job.
What the A thank you round of drinks and a toast to Amy.
Oh.
Your conflict resolution skills has made my childhood dreams come true.
I'm gonna be a ring bearer.
You don't think your dad will make you best man?
Oh, I just assumed he'd ask Jake.
Mm.
Move over, please.
I do have a wedding to plan.
'Cause if this thing is happening, it's not going to be a Boyle brothers event.
For starters, all the bridesmaids are gonna be dressed like Roseanne from the television show, Roseanne.
Oh, I like that show.
A certified shaman will conduct the ceremony, and the ring bearer will be an actual wolf.
Oh man, I could do it, but I wouldn't be as majestic on all fours.
This wedding sounds weird.
I'm into it.
To Lynn and Darlene Boyle.
Cheers.
Yuck.
My lady left me.
My lady stayed.
Come on, sir.
Focus on the good.
You can hold your head up: you took the high road with Wuntch.
Not entirely.
When I was alone in her office, I changed her auto-correct.
Now when she types "Wuntch," it gets replaced with "Butt".
Ah, I should not have gone to that party.
I shouldn't have gone to that bathroom.
I should not have arrested her boss.
I don't see it that way.
You did everything right.
You were a good cop.
Good lonely cop.
Hey, man, you put yourself out there.
You weren't breezy.
You like Sophia, you fought for her.
You should be proud.
No, you should be changing her auto-correct.
What's her last name?
Perez.
No.
It's "Butt" now.
Sophia Butt.
That's feels good, doesn't it?
Not really.
Okay.
Then let's get soused.
Ah, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Mine.
Mine.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Whatcha got there?
A candle, perfume.
Bra.
Someone's dropping off a care-package for mom.
Ew.
No.
It's the stuff that Sophia left at my apartment.
Oh, bud.
Oh, bud.
Breakups are the worst.
Man, I just want to walk up to Sophia, slap her in the face and say, "Girl, you messed up".
You need to destroy that stuff.
You want me to crush that big box into a little ball with my bare hands?
No.
I'm gonna text Sophia and give her her stuff back.
That way I'll get to see her again and hopefully smell the air around her hair.
That'll make me feel better.
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay, you need to embrace the pain so you can get through it.
You need catharsis.
Sarge is right.
You need to cathart.
Cathart your brains out.
Cathart all over the place.
That is a great point, guys.
Thank you.
You know who'd appreciate that a lot is Sophia, I'm gonna text her.
I'm gonna take that phone now, Jake.
I'd like to see you try.
Well, you did that very easily.
Look, I understand that you're trying to help, but I promise you, the best thing for me right now is to text Sophia.
Give me my phone?
Okay.
Thank you.
And send.
Why hasn't she written back yet?
Uh, this feels terrible.
You two could have stopped this, but you didn't, you monsters.
Hey.
Any idea what this emergency meeting is about?
Probably about how all the cell towers in the city are broken, and that's why Sophia hasn't texted me back.
I keep checking my phone every three seconds, like a loser.
Tread lightly, son.
Jacob Have you done any of the catharting exercises I gave you?
Well, I don't own a bathtub, so the first two pages are out.
And it's the middle of winter, so where would I dance in a fountain?
Indoor malls, Jake.
Indoor malls.
All right, squad.
Evry year, the Department of Homeland Security runs a multi-agency counter-terrorism drill.
The team from the DOD had to drop out at the last minute.
Thanks to our stellar scores at last year's tactical village Nine-nine!
They want us to fill in.
We are the only non-federal agency ever invited to this event.
This is a huge opportunity and we are going to nail it!
Nine-nine!
All: Yeah!
Charles?
Yeah?
You know what I'm thinking?
Yes, we should pack grapes for the road.
No.
This drill couldn't have come at a better time.
I'm gonna throw myself into it and focus solely on getting a win, and not whether or not Sophia's texted me back.
Which she hasn't, in case anyone was wondering.
Nine-nine!
All: Yeah!
Nine-nine!
I don't get it.
Santiago, Diaz.
Before you go, both of you requested to have this Saturday off, but I need one of you to work.
Oh, I could take that shift.
Well, last time you worked a Saturday, you watched cartoons the entire time.
Well, that's when they're on.
Work this out and get back to me.
Sorry.
I can't reschedule.
I have tickets to a TED Talk on power poses and getting what you want by using your body.
Uh-oh.
I hope it doesn't get too sexual.
"Uh-oh, I hope it doesn't get too sexual".
Title of your sex tape.
But seriously, what is taking so long?
Also the title of your sex tape.
Well, I have plans on Saturday too.
I'm having dinner with my parents.
So?
You don't even like your parents.
You call them smiley morons and hug freaks.
Plans are plans, I'm a badass, not an anarchist.
I don't buy it.
You know, if you told me what you were really doing, I'd consider changing my plans.
But you didn't so I'm getting Saturday off.
Are you trying to power pose me?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm supposed to be sitting in a chair.
This is why I need to see the talk!
Captain, is the entire squad at this dumb field trip?
Yes, they are.
Is there a problem?
Uh, yeah.
You know how I've been defying all expectations by going back to school?
I always knew you had it in you.
Can't you just be blown away by me?
I need someone to take this personality test for my Psych class.
I was hoping to wow my professor with a genuine psycho like Amy, or Hitchcock, or Charles would be great.
I'm not a psycho, but I could take your test.
That would be awesome.
I do need to warn you that the results can be a little unflattering.
It's okay, I'm no stranger to unflattering test results.
Your blood pressure's normal.
Normal?
Take it again.
I'm not afraid to have my flaws exposed.
But just to be clear, though, it is possible to get a result that shows no flaws?
I guess.
Good.
Good.
Can't wait to begin.
Sophia text you?
No, it's just a lightly racist email forward from my Grandma.
But it doesn't matter.
It's time to cathart.
Check it out.
Windbreaker city.
ATF, Marshals, ICE, FBI, Homeland Security.
Welcome to the big leagues, Boyle.
Oh, say that again.
I want to record it and use it as my ringtone.
Eh.
Hey, there.
Jake Peralta, NYPD.
Pleasure to meet a colleague.
Colleague?
Dude, read the jacket.
Homeland.
We're not on the same level.
Wow.
That was incredibly rude.
No, no, no, no.
I've always admired people who decided what they wanted to be when they were six years old and never waivered.
Bus drivers, ice cream men.
Princesses.
So when exactly did you decide you wanted to be a butt?
Was it college?
Law school.
Just wanted to let you know that I went to law school.
At Butt University?
What are you doing?
I'm standing up for us.
Don't worry about it, that guy doesn't matter.
All right.
Everybody, take their seats.
My name is Agent Kendrick, Homeland Security.
And I am in charge here.
Sarge, I was wrong.
He totally matters.
This year's scenario.
Terrorists have stormed the Capital Trust bank building and have taken hostages.
Noice!
Oh, cool trick.
I don't have a ton of free time to practice high-fiving.
You just made fun of us for that.
For practicing, that's the first time we ever tried it.
Here are your assignments.
ATF, you will be our terrorists.
Ooh, that's a rough draw.
Homeland Security, you are Command Control.
Marshals, Strike Team Alpha.
And NYPD?
Helicopter snipers, helicopter snipers.
Says here you will be our hostages.
What?
So you just want us to lie on the ground and do nothing, like a bunch of losers?
Yes, precisely.
No.
Jackpot.
Can you leave me some wiggle room so I can check my phone periodically?
Why?
Waiting for your mom to text?
No, actually, I'm waiting for a girl who broke up with me to text.
That's way worse.
Yeah, it's bad.
This sucks.
I just got dumped by a mega-fox and no one's letting me shoot a big gun about it.
All right, you know what?
Screw this.
I'm not gonna just sit here like a loser.
Boyle, free me, then I'll free you.
We're fighting back.
No, Jake.
We are behaving so we can be invited again next year.
Sarge, with all due respect, I am going to completely ignore everything you just said.
Okay, Charles.
Our hands are tied so we're gonna have to use our mouth.
Smart.
Wet the tape down with my saliva until you could slip right out.
No, bite it.
Obviously, bite it.
I don't like it.
Something stinks.
Well, I'm sorry.
But I refuse to mask my natural musk with a bunch of chemicals.
Uh, I was talking to Rosa about her "dinner" with her "parents".
I am having dinner with my parents.
Okay, liar.
What restaurant are you going to?
I don't know, some Italian place.
Oh, Italian?
Makes sense, Pinocchio.
He's a liar too, and Italian.
I overexplained it.
Okay, last question.
What body of water do you most identify with?
A, lake, B, river, C, ocean.
Oh, they can't be serious.
Of course I choose ocean.
I hate the ocean.
That's where that stuck-up bitch Rose let Leo die.
There was plenty of room on that door.
Okay, the computer is tabulating.
Ohh.
You got category I9 C3 G6.
I9 C3 G6.
Is that as good as it sounds?
You have a robust sense of self and are well suited to leadership positions.
Characteristics strength, determination, tenacity.
Yes, I suppose that's accurate.
They do call me Tenacious Ray down at the country club.
Because for the past 10 years, I've been suing them for discrimination.
I'm very pleased with this assessment.
You should be.
I took the test too and I also got an I9 C3 G6.
What?
We got the same score?
It's just crazy how accurate this thing is.
Yes.
Crazy.
All right, Sarge.
Now to cut you loose.
No, I'm staying tied up.
I don't care how much of a jerk Kendrick is.
I want it to be clear I had no part in this.
No offense, but you are a huge waste of muscles.
Okay, Boyle.
There's two guards outside this door.
We need their guns.
You know what to do.
Beat 'em up?
Pretend to be sick and lure them in here.
Right.
The Charles.
Here we go.
Help!
I need help.
I'm sick.
Is this part of the drill?
What's wrong?
I have Seasonal Affective Disorder.
What?
It's a serious condition that affects millions of Americans.
What the hell?
We're fighting back, you terrorist crap sack.
Also, thank you for including us in this event.
You got a partner outside, right?
Call him in here.
I need help!
Ow.
Shh.
You're dead.
See you later, losers.
Again, opportunity of a lifetime.
Just a real positive experience.
All right, we need to distract them.
Do you have anything I can throw?
I have a dog tag.
Oh, that is bad ass, Boyle.
No it's an actual tag for a dog.
Yep.
Molly.
She was my poodle growing up.
Never forget your first.
Your first what?
Dog.
That is never what people mean by that.
When you get to hell, say hi to Molly.
What?
Why is Molly in hell?
Cause it sounds cooler than heaven.
Hiyah!
Both: Aah!
Door kick.
What's up, dude?
Is it lunch time?
Is the drill over?
We're freeing you guys.
Jake, can you hear me?
Is it lunch time?
No, it's not lunch time.
It's 10:30 in the morning.
No wonder I'm starving.
Look, we came here to win and they're not even giving us a chance.
I think it's fair to say that no one in the history of America has been discriminated against more.
Buddy.
Yeah, that's my B. Adrenaline talking.
So you guys in?
I don't know.
I don't want to get in trouble.
Oh, wow.
You sound like a real Terry.
Why don't you just take your shirt off and make your pecs bounce around?
Again, the adrenaline.
Don't sue me.
Look, you two are still arguing about who gets Saturday off, right?
Highest body count wins.
Done.
I'm gonna vape you like my e-cig.
Okay, you basically just lost.
Nine-nine, we are hostages no longer.
You know, I really meant to rip off the whole thing, but I say we go with it!
Come with me, hos!
Jake, this is great.
I shot a guy in the face.
He is so mad at me.
Nice.
All right, this hallway is clear.
I think we killed them all.
It's a regular paint bath.
Like bubble bath.
No, like blood bath.
All right, meet in the basement.
Here we go!
Hyah!
Okay, me and Boyle took down six.
Rosa and Amy got 14.
Hitchcock and Scully?
Were killed immediately.
Yeah, we're dead.
We also disarmed and captured all these guys, so is that all the terrorists?
Not quite.
Drop your weapons, everybody.
Drop them right now.
It's over.
You lost.
Drop them now or You're dead, crap sack.
All right, Sarge!
You decided to be cool.
I'm always cool.
I also couldn't spend another second listening to those ATF wads bitch and moan.
Leave it to the NYPD to screw up being hostages.
I thought cops loved to sit around on their fat asses all day and do nothing.
That's it.
Whoa!
My ass is not fat!
Kinda sounds like it was just about your weight issues.
I'm not gonna lie, that did strike a chord.
But I also didn't like the stuff they were saying about us.
Look, I'm proud to be a cop.
This drill is over.
Let's get the hell outta here.
Drinks on me!
Nine-nine!
All: Yeah!
Oh, my God, it worked.
Let's go.
And nothing from Sophia.
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Um, we're not quite finished yet.
I know I, for one, am not done kicking bootay.
Dude, there's no more terrorists.
No, but there's more catharting to do.
We can make everyone regret ever taping us to chairs in the first place.
Sarge?
It seems unnecessary to piss everyone off.
I heard one of the Marshals call you jiggly Jeffords.
What?
Give me another clip.
Now we're talking.
You two are tied, right?
Both: Yeah.
Settle that score.
Jake, what do you say?
Want to go after the Marshals?
And this butt from Homeland?
Get yourself a real win?
I don't know, Boyle.
I mean, they're the good guys.
And that would make us the bad guys.
Noice.
So you're in?
Oh, I'm in.
I'm in all the way to hell.
And when I get there, I'm gonna see your dog, Molly.
Let's go, squad.
That was really unnecessary.
Jake, come outside.
I've got Kendrick here.
Peralta, what are you doing?
You're NYPD, you're supposed to be hostages.
Supposed to be.
But we rose up and took down the terrorists.
That's right.
We're the bad guys now.
Is this some sort of game to you?
Does this sound like a game?
I am a terrorist leader.
My name is Francis Gruber.
My brother, Hans, died at Nakatomi Tower at the hands of John McClane.
Also, I'm related to Jeremy Irons from the third one.
Okay, so it is a game.
Well, I'm not playing.
Drill's over.
Drill's over, boys.
Yeah, that sounds right.
We're not on the same level.
And apparently, you're at the level that can't handle us.
You trying to goad me, Peralta?
'Cause I'm in charge here and I don't have to engage with mall cops.
But I will.
Say it, don't spray it.
I'm in.
What are your demands?
A guarantee that this drill doesn't end until one of us is dead.
Also, one large pizza with fennel sausage.
Brick oven, otherwise it's sog city.
And Scully needs some Gas-o-nex.
Extra strength.
Chewable!
Okay, so a fight to the death, pizza and Gas-o-nex.
Chewable!
You have 30 minutes to meet our demands.
After that, we paint ball a hostage every 15 minutes.
Got yourself a deal, Gruber.
Get us those demands.
We'll be waiting.
We're not waiting one second.
Those demands were a ruse.
They were?
I really need that Gas-o-nex.
I think there was some dairy in the cheesecake that I ate for breakfast.
We're not gonna hang around like sitting ducks.
We're gonna take the fight to them.
Like some waddling ducks!
If the waddling was super fast and cool.
Like some boss-ass penguins.
Yes!
I'm so glad you're back on our side, Sarge.
Okay, let's destroy some good guys.
Gina, I was outside on business and I purchased a box of assorted sweet treats.
I give you the first pick.
Don't mind if I do.
Curious.
On your personality test, you said your favorite shape was a square.
And yet now, when you're given a choice between round cookies and square blondies, you opt for the cookie.
You opt for the circle.
Yes, but it's not about shapes.
I'm choosing a cookie over a blondie.
I'm whimsical, but I'm not a lunatic.
For butter, eggs, flour, sugar, baking soda, chocolate, salt, vanilla.
The basic building blocks are identical.
The only salient difference their shape.
You're trying to get me bumped out of I9 C3 G6.
You don't like that the test put us in the same category.
That is so rude.
Do you know how many basic bitches would kill to have the same personality as me?
Gina, you know I appreciate you but you have to admit, we're not exactly cut from the same cloth.
Apparently not.
I, of course, am an exotic silk, whereas you, sir, are snake skin.
So you can keep your box of deception and leave me alone.
It's a box of shapes and it contains only the truth.
Fennel sausage.
Jake, they did it!
Balcony's over there.
How many are out there?
Six Marshals.
We're pinned down.
Great, it's over and we're still tied, 8-8.
What the hell?
Saturday's mine.
You said body count, you didn't say whose body.
Boom!
Power pose.
Ahh!
They got me.
I'm dead too.
Kendrick?
Come out!
It's just you and me.
Okay, okay.
I'm outta ammo.
Be cool.
Well, well, well.
Hello, agent.
You don't actually have to shoot me.
We can just say that you won.
But I want to shoot you.
No way this is brick oven.
They were playing us, Jake!
Right, you're having a moment.
So.
Any last words?
Just don't shoot me in the face.
I got a date tonight.
I don't want it to puff up.
I'm already 10 pounds heavier than the picture she saw.
Okay.
Just to clarify, those are your last words?
Because I'm about to shoot you.
Ow!
What?
No!
Gun taped to the back.
All these Die Hard references gave me the idea.
I got John McClane-d.
That is so much worse than any paint ball.
Interesting tactic, detectives.
Show up at your first inter-agency drill and mess the whole thing up.
Less of a tactic and more of a series of incredible events.
And what was the most incredible event when I shot you in front of all your friends?
I have other friends.
Who?
I knew it was a dumb idea to invite the NYPD to a federal drill.
Seriously, man?
You took all our guns, taped us to a bunch of chairs, called us fat, and we still took almost all of you out.
Next year, we're winning this thing.
Oh, you're not coming next year.
But maybe I'll see you at the Pentagon Christmas party.
Oh, right.
You guys aren't invited to those.
Kid Rock was there.
Those are my last words, bro.
Man.
He is just a really bad dude.
Jake, I'm sorry you didn't get your win.
Are you kidding?
This was a total win.
I haven't checked my phone in forever.
Now that I've said that, I do kinda want to check it, though.
I'm gonna just do it.
No text.
But I'm probably 20 percent less devastated than I would have been this morning.
And that's thanks to you guys.
I catharted.
You catharted hard.
Gina, I've been thinking long and hard about what happened yesterday.
Oh, pray tell.
But remember, I'm not at your level so do speak down to me.
I owe you an apology.
The test was wrong to classify us both as I9 C3 G6's.
That's a terrible apology from content to tone.
I meant I don't deserve to be an I9 C3 G6.
I should be an I9 C3 G4 or an I8 C5 G3, or even an I7 C7 G8 or I2 C1 G3.
Is this a Rain Man impression?
No.
Those are all personality types not well-suited to leadership.
Just as I have not been.
A good leader should never diminish those around him.
It was devastating.
Gina.
You're tenacious, you're strong.
You're a great leader.
And most importantly, any basic bitch would be lucky to be like you.
Apology accepted.
Can I have a huge raise?
No.
But I am expanding your responsibilities to match your great promise.
You are now in charge of all scheduling decisions and budget tracking.
No!
You can do it, trust me.
From one I9 C3 G6 to another.
It's crazy how much he flirts with me.
Hey, so I told Captain Holt I'd work on Saturday.
Wait, why?
You won fair and square.
I mean, I murdered you.
That was pretty shady.
Also, it was crazy assertive and I feel like maybe I don't actually need power pose training.
You don't.
Mostly because nobody needs power pose training.
The dinner with my parents on Saturday is to introduce them to Marcus.
What?
Why didn't you just tell me?
I didn't know stuff was getting that serious.
Yeah.
It's very embarrassing having feelings.
Anyway, thank you.
You're welcome.
Rosa's in love!
Power pose.
Dropping this off for Sophia Perez.
Oh, no, you don't have to call her.
I'll just leave it here with you.
Okay.
Jake?
Hey.
Hi, uh.
Sorry I didn't text you back.
Thanks for bringing my things.
Well, I need to move on and having this stuff around makes that difficult, so.
Including this multi-surface cleaner?
Well, I only bought that to impress you.
And it worked, so All right, well, I should probably get back to arresting bad guys.
Yeah, I should, uh, get back to proving they're not so bad.
Jake and Sophia.
Enemies for life.
Like McClane and Gruber.
Both: You're the Gruber.
You're the Gruber.
I'll see you in court, Jake.
Okay.
Bye.
Tell me if she turns back for one last look.
She turning?
Did she turn?
Did she turn?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
All right, here's where we stand.
This nightclub is the home base for the Maric crime syndicate.
I've been tracking the club owner, Vladimir Drogic, aka The Dragon, aka my first perp with a cool nickname.
What about El Baboso, The Dagger?
Yeah, turns out Rosa was lying about that.
El Baboso actually means "the slug".
Ha ha, tonto.
That means "dumb-dumb".
It was very cruel.
I referred to myself as El Baboso to several beautiful Latina ladies.
Oh, that's your type, isn't it, Jakey?
Like Sophia and Sa Anyway, The Dragon is involved in several counts of human trafficking as well as I'm sorry, what's going on?
Who are you?
Drexel with the Organized Crime unit.
I'm here for the Maric case materials.
Oh, are you?
Well, we'll see what my captain has to say about this.
Thank you for taking the materials.
Make sure you also pick up the files that are on Peralta's desk.
Wow, that is not how I saw it playing out.
Sir, I thought you said this was my case.
I gave you two weeks.
I'm done fending off the Organized Crime unit.
Squad, since Peralta's briefing was cut short, you can all use this time to clean up your desks.
Look at this place: half-eaten food, crumpled tissues, pictures of your families.
What's wrong with pictures?
If you love someone, you'll remember what they look like.
- What is this?
- Rubber band ball.
Keep your bands in a box or a bag.
Since you all apparently have time to play throw, I'm canceling overtime for the month, effective immediately.
Get to work!
And de-ball these bands.
Brooklyn Nine-Nine - 02x16 The Wednesday What is going on?
Holt's been in a bad mood all week.
Did somebody do something to set him off?
Jake, are you seriously asking why Captain Holt is mad?
- What do you mean?
- The Wednesday incident.
Hey, hey, just closed my tenth felony of the month, and I thought we could celebrate.
Might I remind you that this is a police precinct and it's 10:00 in the morning?
Thought you might say that.
That's why this is nonalcoholic sparkling cider.
There's absolutely nothing you could be mad about.
Uh-oh.
No, no, no, look, I was the first one in on Wednesday.
This story's already full of holes.
He was in a bad mood before those sprinklers went off.
Something must have happened at home.
Dude, just admit that you ruined everything and you turned our lives into a living hell.
- No biggie.
- You guys, this is not my fault.
Boyle, you believe me, right?
Don't make me do this, Jake.
Betrayed!
All right, you know what?
Fine.
I'm gonna prove to all of you that something else is responsible for his bad mood.
It's probably Boyle.
Don't worry about it.
Don't open it.
No personal calls.
What the hell?
That was Marcus.
He's gonna think I hung up on him.
Leave him wanting more.
That's basic seduction stuff, Diaz.
Captain Holt has been in a bad mood, and I'm not letting it get any worse on my watch.
I need overtime back.
Ladies and gentlemen, six banks robbed in three weeks, $250,000 stolen, citizens trembling in fear.
Well, no more.
Boyle, you got your bank robber.
Went home last night no overtime.
Just me and some brie, and I cracked it.
So here he is, the thug that's been terrorizing the city.
Say hello, Marvin.
Hello.
Oh, my God, he's so old.
He's not that old.
His nurse isn't even full-time.
He couldn't pull off a bank job.
He couldn't pull off the cap on his medicine.
I can hear you.
Sorry.
Hey, this guy is a ruthless criminal.
I'm sorry, sir.
Is this gonna take long?
'Cause I was hoping to buy some slacks this afternoon.
I like corduroy.
You like corduroy?
- I love corduroy.
- He likes corduroy.
You sure you have the right guy?
Wasn't the robber strong and fast?
- And able to eat solid foods?
- Nobody saw him eat.
The guy wore a rubber mask, and his voice was disguised.
My system is a little unsettled.
Could I trouble you for a ginger ale?
Oh, of course, sir.
We'll get that and a comfy chair for you to sit in.
Yeah.
I robbed those banks.
I don't even need the money, but I like to see the tellers squirm.
- I get off on violence.
- Oh, my God.
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you so much.
You're such a doll.
I must pay you.
No, no, no, I insist.
I insist.
Right here.
You remind me of my granddaughter.
Oh, you are so sweet.
I haven't got a granddaughter.
What are you doing here?
You're not scheduled to work today, and overtime is canceled.
Yeah, well, remember about a week ago when I came in here with a bottle of sparkling cider?
Setting off my sprinklers, drenching my office, destroying a paper crane folded for me by Kevin.
Right, I forgot how that ended.
The point is, that was all just regular cop stuff.
There's no way that can be the reason you've been in such a bad mood.
Bad mood I'm sorry, haven't I been bursting into song enough for you lately?
Would you like me to click my heels together or skip like a schoolchild?
Yes to all of that.
But for reals, what non-me thing is bothering you?
Is there trouble at home?
Peralta, I'm not gonna discuss my home life with you.
We're not friends.
We're not family.
You're not my husband.
Oh, that's hurtful.
I thought we had a special bond.
I was your secret Santa last year.
And I already thanked you for the "Who Farted"?
baseball cap.
But you never wear it.
So Holt won't tell me if something happened at home because I'm not his husband.
But you know who is his husband?
- His husband.
- His husband.
I was just a little slow.
Yeah, Kevin's not gonna talk to you 'cause he can't stand detectives.
Yes, but he can stand yous.
Nuh-uh, I spent a lot of time cultivating a good relationship with Kevin.
He finally calls me Gina instead of Ms. Linetti.
All right, fine.
Then I'm calling in my chit.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
- No, ch-it.
- What?
Remember when I got you this job?
You said, "OMG, Jake.
I owe you one".
I said "OMG"?
That was before other people started saying it.
I was an originator.
You said I could ask for anything, and for six years, I've been sitting on that chit.
Well, now I'm cashing it in.
A receipt for almonds?
Yeah, I just thought it would be more dramatic to slide something across the table.
It wasn't, but since I made that promise, fine.
Hey, Kevin.
Gina, good to see you.
- Jake's here too.
- Yo.
Gina, I know you like champagne with a drop of pomegranate juice.
I like to say it's nature's classiest alcohol mixed with its narst-iest fruit.
And, Peralta, I hope this will do.
It's a can of orange soda from when some other children visited.
It's perfect.
Thank you for inviting us in.
Yes, I invited Gina in.
You were with her.
Okay.
Look, everyone's blaming me for the captain's horrible mood because of a small thing that happened Wednesday morning.
When you flooded his office with cider?
Well, the water actually flooded it.
The cider just caused it.
But I swear he was already upset when he got to work.
He was anger articulating.
Coat, coat, jacket, coat.
Is this a police precinct or a Turkish bazaar?
Mm, yes, I dread those annunciated denunciations.
Yeah, I hate those de-bunce-ebations But so my question is, could something have happened at home before he left for work?
Well, I remember that morning.
He left this house at 7:00 and was in a great mood.
In fact, he was still chuckling about the previous night's Charlie Rose.
Fine, so your marriage might not be the problem, but he didn't get to work until 10:00.
That means whatever ruined his mood happened in those three hours.
We have to retrace his steps.
We?
I'm not going to investigate my own husband.
Uh-huh, totally.
Well, that was a great chitchat.
Don't you think, Gina?
Seemed like it went real bad for you.
Chit-chat.
Oh.
You know, Kevin, maybe if we figure out what caused Raymond's bad mood, we could fix it.
Good idea, Gina.
I suppose we could look into it.
Yes, great!
Let's go right now.
No time to lose.
Don't look, just run.
You're trying to get me out of here before I see the orange soda you spilled on the chair, aren't you?
I'm already out the door.
It worked!
What the hell?
Are you throwing a tea party for this monster?
He was sitting in processing, and he just looked so lonely.
This guy is guilty.
He confessed to me, but now he's pretending that he didn't.
You must have misheard me.
I didn't do anything, except being charmed by these two lovely ladies.
Oh, cut it with the sweet-old-coot routine.
You're going to jail, my friend, in a trolley named Charles.
- A trolley?
- Trolleys are cool.
They have the bells.
You know what?
Just take your tea and leave my perp alone, please.
Thank you, ladies, for bringing a little sunshine into my gray life.
You want to know what I'm gonna do with the money I stole?
- Hmm.
- Prostitutes.
Huh!
Amy, you heard him.
Tell me you heard him.
- What?
- Son of a bitch!
Well, this is where Raymond eats breakfast every morning.
Yes, I know.
He's always raving about how they don't have specials.
Diane, hello, this is my friend Gina, and this is Detective Peralta.
They work with my Raymond.
Oh, Peralta, you are so old to behave the way you do.
- Oof.
- What?
I'm sure he vents about everyone on the squad.
Nope, just you.
Damn it, Diane, what are you doing after this?
So did anything unusual happen when Raymond was here last Wednesday?
Did he mention anything?
No, he had his regular breakfast: room-temperature water and one hard-boiled egg yolk.
Hmm, well, that is his good-mood food.
So, Peralta, we know he was fine through breakfast.
Looks like you're still on the hook.
No, there was still plenty of time before he got to work.
Gina, what'd he do next?
Well, according to his sched, his next stop was his weekly painting class.
Painting class?
Can I guess what he paints?
Pictures of pie charts.
Multiple still lifes of this gray rock.
That's even more boring.
So, Gerald, did anything happen to Raymond last week?
Did he seem like something or someone had him in a bad mood?
It was his day to pick the music, and he chose Haydn.
So he was in a good mood or a bad mood?
A great mood, Jake.
Oh, you're Jake.
Damn it.
What are you doing after this, Gerald?
What is wrong with our Internet?
I like to back up my data every 15 minutes, and it's taking 17 minutes per backup!
I'm in a data backup deficit.
We are in the same boat.
I've been trying to load this video all day.
You're watching videos during work?
I told him to do it, sir.
It's case-related.
"Turtle humps computer mouse".
Yeah, Turtle's the name of a local pervert we're chasing.
Come on, Hitchcock.
Get it together.
So did anything strange happen when you and Raymond sparred last week?
No, as usual, Raymond was the king of the croisÃ©, and I got in a few good raddoppios.
So just a bunch of normal words.
Are you sure we're talking about last Wednesday?
Positive.
Haven't seen him since.
You haven't?
Mm-mm.
I'm sorry.
I need to leave.
Excuse me.
Kevin.
Kev.
What's going on?
Raymond has been lying to me.
Three mornings this week, he told me he was fencing with Dan.
Why would he do that?
Why would he lie to me?
I don't know.
Maybe it's connected to his bad mood.
My husband does not lie to me.
This investigation of yours was a bad idea.
I'm going home.
I have to sort this out with Raymond.
Good-bye, Peralta.
Linetti.
Linetti?
No.
We were on a first-name basis.
Gina, this is bad.
Kevin's upset.
Holt's gonna be angry.
We're both gonna get fired, and I'm gonna die alone.
Jake, why don't you just do the right thing and jump out a window?
Captain Holt will never fire me if he knows I'm mourning the death of a close friend.
Or we could try plan B and just fix it.
You never even tried plan A, though.
Hey, how'd it go with Kevin?
Are you willing to admit everything's your fault?
No, Amy, because none of this is my fault.
Except for how you meddled in the captain's life today, possibly causing repercussions in his marriage that could last a lifetime.
Yes, that is completely on me, but, Amy, you didn't know that, so you were still wrong.
You two need to go.
You're not supposed to be here, and the captain's at a new level of anger: constant smiling.
It's horrible.
All smiling's horrible.
This is worse.
We're here so I can activate the Holy Network of Administrative Assistants, acronym HNAA.
We high-level assistants keep track of what's going on with all the bosses.
Jealous, Amy?
Yeah, I'd tap that.
Network.
I'd tap that network.
That's a thing people say.
Yeah?
No.
I've answered all your questions, young man.
What more do you want from me?
I'd like you tell Santiago about the banks you robbed and how you get off on violence.
What?
Boyle, oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Why are you being so weird about this?
Marvin Miller is guilty, and he thinks he can get away with it.
He also thinks the subway should be horses.
He's old, is what I'm saying.
He knows exactly what he's doing.
He's messing with me because I'm not intimidating like Terry or dignified like Jake or model-handsome like Jake or funny like Jake.
Yeah, I might buy my shoes at a kids store, and, yeah, I might be scared of geese, but I am a damn good cop, and I will not be made a fool of.
So I'm gonna go into that room, and I'm gonna get that lousy old geezer to admit on camera that he robbed those banks.
He just died.
What?
Okay, here's what I learned.
The chief's assistant, Ryan, was only pretending to have Mono.
- Okay, Gina, about Holt.
- Fine.
Apparently he was supposed to meet Deputy Chief Ash near his fencing club at 9:30, but he canceled at the very last minute with no explanation.
HNAA does it again.
Okay, so something happened between fencing and coffee.
We just have to figure out what.
Totes, but first, let's check in with Ryan on how to fake mono, 'cause if I can nail that Ooh, game changer.
Okay, so Captain Holt leaves fencing and heads north.
If we really want to do this, we got to get in his head.
We have to be Captain Holt.
Hello, Gina.
How does this sound?
Captain Holt, is that you?
Oh, no, it's Jake nailing your voice exactly.
Right?
The trick is to find a key phrase you know exactly how he'd say.
Mine is, "Peralta, that's enough".
Seriously, Jake, this is getting scary.
Come with me, young, wise assistant.
Let us walk in this direction.
Oh, a hot dog.
Would I stop?
Not for one of those, I wouldn't.
Damn it, it's morphing into British.
Do your catchphrase.
Peralta, that's enough!
And I'm walking with purpose.
And I'm walking with purpose.
And bingo.
A door.
It's a Narnia situation.
No, but I love that.
It's a security camera.
If something happened to Holt when he walked past here, we'll be able to see it.
Peralta, you genius.
Mm, that does not sound like him.
Okay, personal photos are down, kitchen is spotless, and I got the silver-painted break-dancer outside to move his very loud boom box elsewhere.
- You beat him in a dance-off?
- No, I destroyed him.
There's absolutely nothing here that will set off Holt.
Oh, oh!
I was trying to cook my oatmeal with a road flare, but it caught on fire.
Why are you using a road flare?
You said the kitchen was off-limits.
Yeah, this is your fault, Sarge.
Give me that.
I'm just holding a road flare, stepping on some oatmeal.
Just doing me.
I can't believe that you, of all people, are my biggest problem today, Jeffords.
- Kevin, is the captain home?
- No.
Good, I figured out what happened to him.
- He was mugged.
- What?
He told you this?
No, I used my detective skills as well as my spot-on Holt impression to figure it out.
I retraced his steps and found security footage.
After he left fencing, three shady guys followed him into an alley.
One of them had a knife.
That's why he's been in such a bad mood.
He's a police captain that got mugged.
He's embarrassed.
Oh, my goodness.
- Peralta.
- There he is.
What are you doing in my house?
- Raymond, you were mugged?
- What?
What did you say to him?
Captain, it's okay.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
I'm not embarrassed, and I wasn't mugged.
Three men tried to mug me, but I fought them off, injuring two of them.
Wait, so you heroically fought off three guys, and that put you in a bad mood?
If I did that, I would literally write a song about myself.
It would be like Jake the hero Abs of steel Sha-la, la-la Why would you keep this from me, and why would you lie about going to fencing?
Because he couldn't go, because he's injured.
I wasn't injured.
I was lightly stabbed.
I'm sorry.
You were stabbed?
Lightly stabbed.
I didn't want to frighten you.
You are my husband.
I want you to tell me everything, especially things that might frighten me.
How can you not know that?
Raymond, you are unbelievable.
Hey, Captain, you look so tall.
What you have done is beyond unprofessional.
You cannot muck around in people's private lives.
Get out of my house.
But get into your car?
I'll go.
- Sir.
- Detective.
So how was your night?
Of work.
I'm not asking about your personal life.
I don't care about you personally.
I mean, I'm neutral.
I mean, who are you?
Floundering is worse than silence.
Oh, cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Cool, cool, no doubt.
No doubt, no doubt.
Man, this elevator's slow, huh?
That's because you haven't pressed the button.
That's why you're the captain.
So smart.
I'm gonna just zip.
No more talk-y.
Hmm.
Eek, blast of cold air coming out of that box.
Name of Amy's sex tape.
Hey, man, come on.
Not cool.
I'm going through something.
Just let me have this one.
I'm sorry you wasted your chit, Jake.
It's all right.
I want to apologize to Holt, but it seems personal, and I'm not supposed to talk to him about personal stuff.
Oh, boo, I guess you need to think of some professional way to make it up to him.
Wait a minute.
Gina, that's it.
I just had an idea.
Peralta, you're a genius.
Who was that, ScarJo?
It was Holt, and I think you know that.
I thought it was ScarJo.
I can't believe that bastard beat me.
Whoa, he's dead.
It's kind of hard to see how he's the winner in this.
He made me look like an idiot.
No, Amy and I were the idiots, because we let that ancient windbag fool us.
He robbed the banks.
He gave me money for the ginger ale.
After you insisted he was guilty, I went back and checked his dollar.
Serial numbers match the stolen bills.
You brought in the right guy.
You're a damn good cop, Boyle.
I know.
No one listens.
Except when you threw water in his dead face.
That was rough.
I thought he was faking it.
I wanted to splash the lies out of him.
All right, Detective, what's this all about?
- You have 70 seconds.
- Why 70?
Do you really want to waste your time while I explain my algorithm?
Right, all right, so I pulled a still from the security footage of your attempted mugging and sent it to the nearby precincts.
We ID'd one of the mopes, and that's his apartment.
I thought maybe you would want to do the honors.
And you think this will make everything you did better?
Well, maybe.
It was Gina's idea, so - It will.
- Gina had nothing to do with it.
You want to know why I was so angry all week?
When those men came at me, I acted like I was a 20-year-old.
I took a stupid risk, and I got myself stabbed.
I was in pain and frustrated about lying to the man I love.
- Kevin.
- Yes.
- Obviously Kevin.
- Obviously.
What I'm trying to say is, you were right all along.
I wasn't mad at you.
I was mad at myself, and I took it out on the squad.
Peralta, you're a genius.
Oh, my God.
You said it.
I heard you practicing in the men's room.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
Attention, squad, quick announcement.
Overtime is reinstated, and you are each allowed two personal photographs, two trinkets, and three assorted knickknacks.
You know what?
Just follow Sergeant Jeffords' lead.
He always knows how to keep this place running smoothly.
Nice, so rubber band balls are back.
Oh, no, it's bad for the bands.
Ah, Kevin.
Let me just get my coat.
Hello, Peralta.
Gina.
Oh, sweet lords of dance, thank you.
We're back on a first-name basis.
Kevin, I am unable and unwilling to discuss personal matters with you.
I'm aware of that, yes.
In any case, thank you for your help.
I brought you both gifts: original Raymond Holts.
I will treasure this painting of a rock for all times.
Ah, Rock 59 and 367.
Those are good rocks.
This guy parties!
Not a doctor.
Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Gregor Minsk, the counterfeiter I've been chasing for two years, has finally resurfaced.
And he's just as evil as ever.
Right.
You hate him because he has a typo on his counterfeit bills.
No.
Because he passed $4 million in fraudulent bills, Jake.
But also, two Rs in "pluribus"?
I mean, did none of those cashiers take Latin?
Okay, let's give Amy a round of applause for whatever that was.
Police briefing.
Still in progress.
And you did great.
But let's get serious, people.
Tomorrow is the wedding.
My mom is marrying, shudder, Charles' dad, toilet emoji.
We are gonna be brother and sister.
To think this started with us just going to town or each others sexy parts.
Charles, promise me that is not in your toast.
It's not.
Come on, man.
Look, I need everything to be perfect.
Status update, Rosa.
How are the flowers?
I don't know.
Yellow.
Terr-bear?
I had my tuxedo altered to make it tighter like you wanted.
Delicious.
Jake, have you checked in with the jeweler?
Yes.
They said the ring will be ready at 2:00 on the wedding day.
I'm gonna pick it up on my way to the ceremony.
This is very important, Jake.
Are you sure you can handle it?
Uh, well, let's see.
Easy, last-minute, and crucial as hell.
Meets all the Peralta criteria.
Good.
These tasks are top priority around here, people.
I don't care how many criminals go free.
All right?
Dismissed.
Uh, I'm not done with my briefing yet.
I said dismissed!
Guys, guess who I'm about to see.
The Bubes?
Michael Buble?
Okay, you're the only one who calls him that.
And no.
Jenny Gildenhorn.
The girl who dumped you at your bar mitzvah?
Yes.
I can still see her slow-dancing with Eddie Fung.
I'm all out of love I'm so lost without you I'll never forgive that bitch for what she did to you.
Well, you better forgive her because she's about to become, uh, my girlfriend.
Turns out Gina's mom is friends with Jenny Gildenhorn's mom, and Jenny is gonna be at the wedding.
That's right.
I'm finally gonna get the slow-dance that Fung denied me.
Is she even single?
Uh-huh.
For the first time since we were 13.
Eddie Fung was replaced by Colin Brandow, then Ethan Stokes, then Tanya Astor, don't tell her mother, then she met her husband, Matt Hench, who she divorced three months ago.
Probably because he's a major loser.
I mean, Assistant U.S. Attorney?
Get a real job.
You really kept tabs on her, huh?
It's most of what I do here.
A-ee.
A-ee.
A-ee.
A-ee.
What's happening?
Is Charles having a stroke?
No, he's warning me you're here so I won't talk about other girls.
Just thought it might be weird for you, because of your history.
It's not weird at all.
Yeah.
I told Amy I liked her, she told me she was deeply in love with me, and it's all in the past.
I did not say "love" or "deeply".
It's in the past, Amy.
Move on!
Rosa, I had a question about Marcus and the wedding.
I'm not bringing Marcus.
You guys broke up, huh?
Mm, just hit it and quit it.
We are so similar.
We did not break up.
I'm just not totally sold on the relationship yet, and I don't wanna bring him to some stupid wedding where he might get all romantic and say, "I love you".
I mean, what am I supposed to do then?
Say "I love you" back?
I've only said "I love you" to three people.
My mom, my dad, and my dying grandpa.
And one of those I regret.
Which one?
Grandpa.
He beat cancer, so now I look like an idiot.
Wow, man.
Would either of you like a starring role in the wedding of the century?
I already told you, I'm not go-go dancing.
Well, someone's getting in that cage.
But more importantly, my mom's priest dropped out, so I need one of you two to step up.
Who would be better equipped to deliver a heartfelt, emotional speech about love?
I have to imagine it's not me.
I could do it.
I'm already ordained.
Mario, Karen, yesterday was chest and shoulders.
Today, and for the rest of your life, it's heart and soul.
Smart.
You tailored the ceremony to the bride and groom's interests.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's totally what I was doing.
I mean, working out is not the only thing I feel comfortable talking about.
Uh, what would you say is your mom's favorite move at the gym?
My mom likes champagne, baked ziti, the Bahamas.
Charles's dad probably lives under a bridge and uses a puddle as a mirror.
I don't know.
You figure it out.
Okay.
I got the ring.
Let's go.
Okay, thanks.
Try to stay off heroin.
Your mom?
No.
That was my informant.
She spotted my counterfeiter four blocks from here.
We have to go check it out.
Uh, but I wanted to get to the wedding early and reserve a seat so Jenny can sit on my right side.
I'm been practicing my crying and it turns out this is my juicier duct.
Please?
I've been chasing this guy for two years.
What if it was your collar?
I would have caught him nine months ago in a shootout on top of a ferris wheel.
Minsk is my nemesis.
He's my Eddie Fung.
Fung.
All right, that I understand.
We'll check out your lead, then we'll go to the wedding.
Let's go find Eddie Fung.
Minsk.
Right.
Minsk.
Fung.
Oh, Regina, everything is so beautiful.
Well, as long as you're happy, I'm happy.
Rosa, ah, there you are.
Can you help my dad with his cuff links?
Sure.
I would do it, but it's bad luck for a boy to see his father on his wedding day.
Oh, well, in that case, no.
Rosa, please.
It's a slippery slope from uncuffed sleeves to Lynn just wearing an old turtleneck down the aisle.
Actually, my dad can really rock a turtleneck.
Gives him a sexy Elliott Gould vibe.
Charles, shut up.
Rosa, go find Lynn Boyle and cuff his ass.
There you go.
Thanks.
You nervous?
Oh, not at all.
I love Darlene Linetti with all my parts.
Wow.
I can't ever imagine being with someone and not having any doubts.
I have little doubts.
Tiny little doubts.
You think that's a problem?
I mean, not if you're sure she's the one.
Yes.
Of course.
But I was sure about my five other weddings, too.
Please, don't tell Charles.
He only he only knows about three.
Back-to-back Catfish situations, you know?
Same kid both times actually.
That's okay.
Just took you a while to get it right.
Yeah, or maybe I'm just doing the same thing over and over again.
Lynn Boyle rushes headlong into another mistake.
Like that time I tried water aerobics and I broke my neck.
This is a disaster.
All right, I'm gonna go get Charles.
I wonder what Jenny Gildenhorn will be wearing tonight.
Do you think she'll be in her high school field hockey uniform?
That'd be crazy, right?
Yes, it'd be crazy if that's what she wears to a wedding.
Yeah, you're right.
Ah, well, I hate to say it, but there's no sign of Minsk.
We should really get going.
Jenny awaits.
Oh, my God.
Look!
Fung.
Minsk!
Right, Minsk.
I know it's Minsk.
Let's go!
Clear.
He's gotta be in here somewhere.
Clear.
I love this.
Tux on, gun out.
I feel like James Bond and you're my mysterious femme fatale that I've been partnered with, Maxi Pads.
Maxi Pads?
I don't know!
I didn't want to make the name too sexual and I panicked!
Clear.
If we catch this guy in the next 15 minutes, we can still make the wedding.
So what's your opening line gonna be with Jenny Gildenhorn?
I was thinking I'd go with, "Jamie Gordenhorn"?
You know, make it seem like I haven't been staring at her on the Internet for the past 20 years.
Or you could call her by her real name.
Girls like that.
I don't know.
I think girls like being deceived.
No?
Okay.
Clear.
So, you're really okay with me and Jenny Gildenhorn, huh?
Totally.
Stuff with us is in the past.
We talked about that.
I know.
But that was before you saw me in this dope-ass tux.
I mean, you must be freaking out.
Oh, I am.
I'm really into rented clothes.
I love how many butts have been in them.
I know you're making fun of me, but that sexy voice is kinda getting me going.
But more importantly, this is a fancy outfit, all right?
I sprang for the three button jacket.
It was $8 extra.
He's heading for the alley.
Whoa, hey.
Dad, it's your son under here.
Charles Boyle.
Rosa said you had a personal question.
No, I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm just second-guessing every decision I ever made.
Oh, my God, why did I buy a cube-shaped car?
Because you love it.
Dad, listen Oh!
Let's just sit down Oh!
Screw a 2,000-year-old tradition.
I'm taking the bag off.
Okay, Dad, listen.
Everyone gets nervous.
Everyone gets cold feet.
I was nervous before I married Eleanor.
She ended up cheating on you with the guy from the mattress commercials.
Sleepy Stu?
Don't bring up Sleepy Stu.
Rosa thinks I should call off the wedding.
That is not what I said.
This is why I don't talk to people.
I just asked him if he was feeling nervous.
Rosa, you know how suggestible Boyle men are.
I saw one Samuel L. Jackson movie, and I wore a Kangol hat for three years.
Ah!
There has been a mix-up and the caterer has cooked one of the doves, so I need some good news.
How is that speech going?
Do you want to hear it?
Yes.
"Darlene and Lynn, "I want you to remember the words of Luther Vandross: "'A thousand kisses from you  "'A thousand kisses from you "'is never too much'" Every time he reads it, he breaks down.
I thought you had done this before.
Well, yeah, but that was just workout metaphors.
You told me to get gorgeous with it, and it took me to some very real places.
Terry, I'm sorry, but you're fired.
Captain, the speech is yours.
It needs to be emotional and poetic.
Can you do it?
Well, my first Captain used to call me Emily Dickinson.
Great.
Of course, he meant it as an insult about my sexuality, but don't worry.
I am good at emotion.
NYPD!
We know you're here, Minsk!
Freeze!
Hey!
Gregor Minsk, you're under arrest.
Oh!
I can't let Jenny see me like this.
I ripped my cummerbund.
It's okay.
I have an extra one.
You can borrow it.
From my high school jazz band uniform.
I'm only gonna tell you this because you were a great partner today.
Uh-huh?
I played French horn.
I still do.
Oh, whaaaaaaaaat?
The guests are all here and nothing is ready.
We don't have a ring, the cake says, "Darlene and Lunn," and the smoke machine is not working.
I could crouch by the altar and vape.
You are a stone-cold atrocity.
Okay, we just need to make sure nothing else goes wrong.
Charles Hmm?
Where is your dad?
Where is Lunn?
Um, he's still having a little trouble with his cuff links.
You know us Boyle men and our clumsy ham hands.
Please say you're not gonna reference your ham hands in your toast.
Well, you made me take out the brother-sister sex stuff, so there was this big hole on page 18.
Page 18?
Made it!
Made it in time.
Ew, Amy!
Your dress is filthy.
Luckily I brought you a spare outfit.
Hmm?
I knew I was gonna hate whatever you chose.
Oh, my God.
It's Jenny.
She's here.
Okay, how do I look?
You look great.
Go get her, Bond.
Thanks, Maxi Pads.
Jenny Gildenhorn?
I didn't know you were coming to this.
Jake Peralta?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
How are you?
I'm good.
I'm good.
Wow.
Oh, sorry I'm a little bit ruffled.
I arrested a very dangerous counterfeiter on my way here.
Ah, look at that.
One of my three jacket buttons is unbuttoned.
Must have happened during the fight.
That's embarrassing.
Hey, I don't know anyone here.
Want to sit together?
Uh, yes, I would.
After you.
Uh, Jake, wait!
What are you doing?
Give me the ring.
You sound like Gollum.
That means nothing to me.
I don't see those movies.
I'm too pretty.
Okay.
Well, not to worry.
I've got the ring right here.
Nope.
Those are my mints.
I eat mints.
No big deal.
Um uh-huh I lost the ring.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I must have dropped the ring somewhere around here during the takedown.
I'm so stupid!
No, it's my fault.
I made us go after Minsk.
Please don't climb in here.
I don't want you smelling like garbage for your slow-dance with Jenny Gildenhorn.
Oh, don't worry.
The only thing I'm gonna smell like is the Jason Priestly cologne I wore in middle school.
It's just called "Brandon," and it is overpowering.
Jake!
Look!
Oh, my God!
You found it!
And you're on one knee.
Are you proposing?
Yes.
Will you, Jacob Peralta, accept this ring and bring it with me to our weird friends' parents' wedding?
Yes.
A thousand times, yes!
Oh!
Tight.
Yeah, it's so tight, dawg.
And no, I mean the ring is actually tight.
Amy, it's stuck.
The ring is stuck.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Let me try.
We have to get this off.
Jenny's gonna think I'm married.
Also it'll ruin Lynn and Darlene's wedding.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just us here.
You don't have to pretend like you care about them.
Okay.
Jake has the ring.
I found an extra place setting for your psychic.
Strange, she said you wouldn't be able to.
Because she's a fraud.
You need to start seeing my psychic.
Best of all, I fixed this!
It's working!
How'd you do that?
I grew up with a smoke machine in the apartment, Charles.
I liked to enter the kitchen in the morning with vivacity.
Regina, you're amazing.
Everything's just perfect.
Thank you for making this the third-best day of my life.
Third?
First was having you.
Second was sleeping with a roadie for the Steve Miller Band.
Oh!
I love you, Mom.
I love you.
I love you.
Grab some of those if you're throwing 'em out.
Mwah!
Mwah!
My mom.
You did so great.
I, however, hit a small snag.
No!
Do not take off that tux, Lynn What are you doing?
We had a deal.
I said, "If you hurt my mother, I will cut off your son's testicles".
You're right.
Cut 'em off!
No!
Okay.
As much as I would love to do that, I would like my mom to be happy.
So can you please have a seat?
Mm-hmm.
And just explain to me what is going on.
I'm worried I'm just rushing into this.
I barely know your mom.
I don't even know her favorite kind of soup.
Is it tomato?
Nobody likes soup, Lynn.
You're a family of soup-haters.
What have I done?
Look.
Do you know why my mom loves you?
Because you take big risks.
Like how you got her that dog on your second date.
Those kind of things just blow up in my face half the time.
I mean, the dog worked out great, but The dog was a disaster.
She hates it.
But she loved that you took that shot.
Do you know who never, ever rushes into anything?
Cowards.
That's exactly right, Rosa.
Cowards.
And you're a weirdo.
I'd call you a hobbit Yeah.
A human pile of mashed potatoes Mm-hmm.
But you are no coward, Lynn Boyle.
Lynn Linetti.
I'm taking your mother's name.
Oh!
You're making this hard.
My mom loves you.
You love her.
Now follow your big, weird heart.
Oh, you're right.
It's time for a wedding!
Pants, Dad!
Pants!
A wedding with pants!
Yeah.
Wedding's starting soon.
How are things going?
I was just ordained at but I'm having some trouble with my speech.
All I've got so far is a poem.
Ooh, a poem.
Sounds romantic.
"Marriage is a contract between two adults of different families".
It's a haiku and a fact.
It works on two levels.
Uh, it feels a little impersonal.
What did the officiant say when you got married?
Not much.
When gay marriage was legalized, we weren't sure if or when it was gonna be struck down, so speed was of the essence.
Do you, Kevin Yes.
And do you Yes, yes, we do!
We're married!
I remarked afterwards that I wished the officiant had been more efficient.
It was very funny.
Kevin still talks about it.
Aha!
Maybe I should open with that zinger.
It is amazingly funny.
Oh.
I'm just not sure this is the right crowd for it.
No zinger?
No haiku?
Then I have nothing.
Maybe I should wing it.
Love: It sustains you.
It's like oatmeal.
Okay, okay.
Not bad for winging it.
I lied.
Took me two hours to write that.
How do I look?
Oh!
You look incredible!
Up high!
Down low!
Butts, butts, butts.
You're the worst family in history, but at least you're ready.
Scully's run out of songs.
Right now, he's singing.
Don't, don't, don't, don't Don't you forget about me Best rock and roll song ever written.
Tied with Kokomo.
Hey!
So we have good news and we have great news.
The good news is we found the ring.
The great news is we'll never lose it again.
What are you trying to say?
The ring is stuck on his finger.
I told him not to be cute about it.
I'm cute about everything.
Okay, okay, what do we do?
I could pull the ring off, but it might hurt your little fingers.
That's fine.
I just won't look so I don't know when you're gonna do it.
Jenny!
No!
Okay, this is your last chance to carry me bodyguard-style, so Absolutely not.
and I've been Funged again.
She Funged me!
She doesn't seem that great.
We just saw her making out with a guy she barely even knows.
No, it's not her fault.
Did you see that guy's tux jacket?
Four buttons.
We did this.
Our sex made this happen.
Charles, mic's on.
We can hear all this, bud.
I'm Captain Raymond Holt.
Welcome.
Marriage is a contract but it's so much more than that.
Marriage is love.
It's commitment, it's joy, it's understanding, it's patience, it's anger, it's reconciliation, it's everything.
It's like oatmeal.
It sustains you.
Darlene, do you take Lynn to be your lawfully wedded husband?
I do.
Lynn, do you take Darlene to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Yeah!
Get it, Daddy!
Yeah!
I gotta hand it to you, Captain.
That was some ceremony.
It wasn't difficult.
I simply said what I wish had been said when Kevin and I got married.
Oh, then I never would have heard your hilarious "efficient-officiant" quip.
Mmm, you're right.
I regret nothing.
But all this does make me think I might enjoy a more festive expression of our commitment to one another.
Are you suggesting we hold an honest to goodness wedding?
Nothing too elaborate.
We're not the Kardashian-Wests, after all.
They are a musician and a celebrity personality who recently wedded.
Yes, yes, I know.
They were answers on Jeopardy.
I think you mean questions.
You guys are fun.
He's not playing my playlist.
Congratulatis, Charles.
Marcus!
Rosa said you weren't coming.
Yeah, I wasn't.
Just got the call about an hour ago.
Oh, but, hey.
I'm DVR-ing Bones, so no spoilers.
Don't worry.
I don't watch.
Too scary.
I'm gonna ask the DJ to play Kokomo, and get this place turnt up.
So I didn't ask you to the wedding because I was being a coward.
I was scared things were moving too quickly, but I don't give a crap.
I love you.
That's all I wanted to say.
If you had plans tonight, you can get out of here.
I love you too.
Doesn't have Kokomo.
You guys are in the middle of something.
I'm gonna go to the car, get my CDs.
I'm all out of love I'm so lost without you How is this song playing?
I know you were right Believing for so long  Hey.
Sorry you missed your chance with Jenny Gildenhorn.
It's not a big deal.
She's just a girl that I've been obsessed with since I learned what love was.
Well, we got the bad guy today.
Thank you for helping me.
And I know it's not Jenny Gildenhorn, but if you wanted to slow-dance tonight, I know somebody who'd be into that.
Okay.
Perfect.
This is Gina's great-aunt Susan.
Hi.
She's been asking about you all night.
She thinks you're very handsome.
Says you have a dancer's frame.
Well, you have a good eye, milady.
Shall we?
Oh you.
I'm all out of love What am I without you?
I can't be too late She's very handsy.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Jake, you gotta see this.
There's something going on here.
Something a little hairy.
Nope.
Don't see anything out of the ordinary.
Really?
Well, maybe I should frame the question differently.
Terry, do you notice anything?
Amy?
New shirt?
Oh, come on, guys.
I grew a goatee, and it looks amazing, and I know you can see it.
Of course we can see it, Charles.
It's horrible.
It looks like you unclogged a shower drain with your mouth.
Yeah, you look exactly like the guy in the "Don't Talk to Strangers" poster.
No, I don't.
Are you talking about your new goatee?
Mm-hmm.
I think it's a good choice for your face.
Come over here, so I can take a better look.
Thank you, Captain.
I knew you'd appreciate Bianca.
That's right; I call her Bianca because she's dark and thick like my first cousin Bianca.
Jeffords, Peralta, now.
Wh Say good-bye to Bianca, Boyle.
No!
Hey, Charles.
I want to ask you something, but you have to promise not to get excited and weird.
I can't promise anything of the sort.
It's about restaurants.
I'm so glad I didn't make that promise.
Oh, boy.
All right, where do you take your dad when you want to go someplace special?
Great question.
We go to Csaba.
It's a Hungarian restaurant that serves "TÃ¡l ezer kolbÃ¡sz," the platter of a thousand sausages.
Ugh.
It's symbolic of our manhood.
Okay, I should've saved the "ugh" till then.
Anyways, I'll try and get a reservation.
My dad's coming into town, and we're going out to dinner tonight.
Why are you going to dinner with him?
He hasn't visited you in six years.
Yeah, he's busy.
He's an airline pilot.
Regional airline.
He flies internationally.
Quebec to Albany.
What is going on here?
What's your problem with my dad?
I'm just being wary.
He left you when you were seven, and he's been letting us down ever since.
Us?
I think of you as a brother, Jake, so he didn't just abandon you; He abandoned us.
Look, I know he hasn't been the best dad in the past, but he's changed.
Check it out.
We've been texting.
"New phone.
Who dis"?
No, below that.
Oh.
See, he's coming into town just to see me.
All right, we're gonna go out to dinner tonight, then maybe take a walk through the park, possibly a carriage ride.
If I get chilly, he could loan me his coat.
I'm describing a date.
I don't know what fathers and sons do, but I'm gonna find out!
Joining us for lunch, sir?
Oh, no, I've already consumed the required calories for this day period.
Yummy.
But I do have some fun lunch chitchat.
When I was a detective, my old c.o., Jim Martins, used to keep us on our toes by have us solve brain teasers.
I thought maybe you'd like to try one.
Don't just tease my brain, Captain.
Really go to town on it.
Yeah, bring it on, sir.
I love puzzles.
They're like power squats for your mind.
Good.
Here's a problem.
There are 12 men on an island.
the same amount, but one of them is slightly lighter or heavier.
You must figure out which.
And what do these men look like facially and with respect to their bodies?
It's unimportant.
So like Tyrese.
It's a land of Tyreses.
Sure.
The island has no scales, but there is a seesaw.
The exciting catch: You can only use it three times.
That sounds super exciting.
Is this thing mandatory?
Oh, I hope so.
Please say yes.
No, but there is a prize for whoever solves it first.
Two tickets to this Sunday's BeyoncÃ© Knowles rock music concert.
I'm in.
Marcus loves BeyoncÃ©.
Everyone loves BeyoncÃ©.
My girls were conceived to Bootylicious.
Don't tell my wife I told you that.
Whoop.
Guys, my dad just texted.
He's in the building.
Scully, stop eating.
Terry, start flexing.
Everybody be cool.
Paging Detective Jake Peralta.
Ah, Dad!
How are you, son?
Good to see you.
Hey.
Everyone, this is my dad.
Hey, introduce yourself in your captain's voice.
Folks, this is your pilot speaking, Captain Roger Peralta.
If you look to your left, you'll see me, making your acquaintance.
Love that.
Hi, I'm Jake's best friend, Charles.
How are you?
Pop quiz: What's Jake allergic to?
Bees.
And wasps.
Guy didn't even include wasps.
Huh!
Wasps.
Those aren't even real.
Oh, hey, Captain Holt.
Come meet my dad, Captain Peralta.
Hello, Captain.
Captain.
This is super weird for me.
Captain.
Captain.
Anyways, you guys, my dad is the best pilot.
Oh, come on.
Tell them about Oregon.
Okay, this one time I'm in Eugene, I'm hitching a ride in the jump seat of a commuter jet.
I'm sleeping off a wicked hangover.
Noice.
All of a sudden, there's a jolt and a boom.
A bird.
It was a bird.
Yeah, we sucked a bird into our intake.
Next thing I know, the cabin's filling up with smoke, alarm's going off, engine flames out and dies.
We are in a dead stall.
I look over at the pilot, Sam Power Great name.
He's white as a sheet.
And he says to me I'll never forget what he said.
He says, "Bobby's got a big ol' butt".
Turns out he's having a stroke.
Bring the plane down on a highway, right across from a rest area.
Get on the PA, I say, "Folks, coffee's on me".
What?
Wow.
Are you kidding me?
Anyway, I'm not here to talk about me.
I'm here to spend some time with my boy.
Ah, Dad.
It's good to see you.
You too.
Oh, hey, let me give you a tour of the precinct.
Cool.
Ooh, you can interrogate one of my perps.
No, he can't.
Don't do that, Jake!
You might as well save yourself some paper and give up now, Sarge.
You know I'm going to solve this first.
You probably can't tell, but I'm flexing my brain like crazy right now.
Yeah, you're both wasting your time.
BeyoncÃ©'s my spiritual twin.
Those tickets are my birthright.
No offense, but this is gonna come down to me and the sarge.
Whoa, you think you two are the only ones that can solve puzzles?
Yeah, what about Rosa, Gina, and me?
Is this how you want to die, Hitchcock?
Look, it's just that the sarge and I are really into puzzles.
Remember when I took that Sudoku cruise?
I never even went on deck.
can solve this thing before you two puzzle dorks.
Deal.
You're going down.
You're really not a part of this, Hitchcock.
Did they bring out more sausage while I was in the bathroom?
No, that's still the first mountain.
Good Lord.
Anyways, do you remember what you always did when you'd take me to dinner as a kid?
Tell the waitress it was your birthday, so we'd get a free dessert?
I already did it.
I just told them it was your birthday.
Come on.
Looks like we're going to get two free probably disgusting sausage-filled desserts.
This is pretty fun, right?
I mean, we're actually bonding.
Jake, there's something I want to talk to you about.
Last week I was flying into Albany from Quebec, you know how I always keep my snowboard with me in case I get a chance to carve So cool.
Well, Canadian customs found some prescription meds in my board bag.
They're accusing me of smuggling.
What?
Yeah, I have no idea how they got in there.
They're not mine.
But it's bad.
I could lose my pilot's license.
But you're the best pilot in the world, I'm guessing without knowing anything about the field.
I'm really in a bind here.
Jake, I need your help.
That's actually the reason I'm here.
Oh.
That's the reason.
Happy sausage birthday to both of you.
All right, let's talk about my dad's case.
The case of why he came to town?
I solved it: Because he wanted to take advantage of his son.
Okay, fine.
First I was a little upset, but then I realized this is great.
You know, we'll get to spend some time together, and he'll see what a good cop I am.
He should already think you're great.
Like with my dad, he doesn't need me to prove to him that Jake Peralta is the best cop in the precinct.
He knows it!
Tell us about the case.
Here's what we know so far.
One, Hungarian sausage is an oily mess, and it causes nonstop dumps.
The incontinence is a small price to pay for the deliciousness.
It's disgusting, and it was a terrible recommendation.
Two, the Canadian cops think that my dad used his security clearance to smuggle in over a thousand pills of Turgidol.
Canadian erection medication.
Very potent.
What?
I don't need it.
But I love it.
Oh, boy.
Three, the case against him looks pretty solid.
Four, he's never been a good dad to Jake.
Five, he has been a good dad, especially from ages zero through seven and yesterday through forever.
Six, nonstop dumps.
Enough.
How did you read these files?
They're in French.
Scully translated them for me.
When I was nine, my parents took me to Paris, and they accidentally left me at the Louvre.
By the time they figured it out, they were already back in Queens.
Okay, no one cares about your boring life, Scully.
This is about my dad and proving his innocence.
Sir, I'd like to go to Canada for a few days and help him out.
Of course, but take Boyle with you.
It'd be good to have an objective set of eyes.
Fine, but under protest because he's a jerk.
Also, we'd like to take Scully with us.
Well, perfect.
I do you a favor; You do me one too.
Thank you.
All right, there is no way we let Amy and the sarge beat us.
We sit here until we figure this thing out.
Rosa, my mind is ready.
Okay.
"There's an island with 12 men".
Oh, I'm so bored.
I cannot do it.
I can do this.
One guy's slightly heavier.
There's a seesaw.
I got it.
You use the seesaw to press down on their necks until fatty confesses.
Incorrect.
Damn.
And disturbing.
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain speaking.
That's my dad.
The captain talking right now, I came out of his body.
No big deal.
We're headed for an on-time arrival in Drummondville, Quebec.
Folks, this is a special flight for me, because sitting in seat 3B is my son, Jake Peralta, one of New York's finest.
Oh.
Thanks, Dad!
Love you too.
Got to admit, it was pretty nice of him to bump us up to first class.
Ugh, this plush fabric is making my rump sweat.
Maybe you're just a little too uncultured to enjoy such a sophisticated kind of an experience.
Oh, brother.
What do you say there, Scully, old boy?
Look at this nut mix: It's half cashews!
I hope we never land!
So loud.
Hey, guys.
How you enjoying the flight?
So how's the case going?
Oh, good.
We already have four suspects who work at the airport, and I want to talk to your girlfriend, Denise, because she had access to your bags.
Not on the night in question.
She's been spending some time at her place.
Relationships are complicated.
You cheated on her a bunch, and she found out.
Okay, I deserve that.
Charles, I have cheated on women in the past and on this one too.
You got a penchant for blondes.
Hey, come on, you can't blame a guy for occasionally dropping anchor at the cold Commodore Club.
So seriously, Jake, this is going to be okay?
Oh, yeah.
You're going to be fine.
Yeah.
Oh, my God, Jake.
Who's flying the plane?
Co-pilot, Scully.
Co-pilot.
Okay, look.
Let's try a new approach.
We weigh these three islanders against these three islanders.
If they weigh the same, we eliminate them, and if they don't, we Where'd they go?
Terry's mouth is full of donuts.
You said we could eliminate 'em!
Only if they weigh the same.
We've been here forever.
I'm getting snacky.
Fine.
Let's start over.
Okay, we balance three against three, and if they weigh the same, we just What just happened?
Come on, man.
Stop eating the islanders.
I'm saving them from this weight-obsessed nightmare island.
By murdering them?
I warned you against using donuts.
They're my trigger food.
Mmm.
Terry.
These islanders are delicious.
Okay, so two of our suspects are in the baggage area.
Do you think you can get us access?
You're with a pilot.
I can get you in anywhere.
Hey, you guys want a 10% discount on duty-free maple syrup?
Do I ever!
Roger Peralta.
Roger Peralta Hey!
What?
Scully, what's going on?
"Roger Peralta is under arrest for possession of a controlled substance".
What?
"They found pills in his apartment".
Jake, I don't know what he's talking about.
I swear I don't know how those pills got in my apartment.
Wait.
Jake.
Scully, tell them we're cops.
Tell them!
Shoot.
That means "turnip".
I said we were turnips.
I got it.
Don't worry.
We are turnips!
Nope, that was English.
Yeah.
The cops said your dad's being held without bail, they want us on the next flight out, and that Bernard's is the best poutine place in the airport.
You want some?
No, I don't want poutine right now.
Yes!
Man, I can't believe they found pills at my dad's place.
That means none of our suspects could've possibly done it.
Oh, my God, Boyle.
Is there a chance that my dad is actually a drug smuggler?
Well, let's look at the facts.
Drugs in his luggage, drugs in his apartment.
Terrible dad, terrible husband, cheats on his girlfriend.
I think he did it.
You're right.
He didn't do it.
That's not what I said.
No, you said he cheats on his girlfriend.
Presumably, he has to do that with someone, and that someone would have access to his apartment and his bags.
Dad dropped anchor at the Commodore's Club.
"Someone" is there.
Even so, how do we get in there?
By wearing Dad's pilot uniforms.
No, Jake, I just don't think he's innocent, and I just think So you don't want to be my co-pilot?
I'm in!
Going up to the spirit in the sky Spirit in the sky That's where I'm gonna go when I die When I die When I die and they lay me Sorry, Scully.
We only had two uniforms.
It's okay.
For some reason, all the fries and gravy and cheese upset my tummy.
Huh.
Going up to the spirit in the sky Spirit in the sky That's where I'm gonna Are you here because you've solved my brain teaser?
Sir, you've been an underdog your whole life.
But you defied the odds by having others secretly help you 'cause you didn't have what it took.
That's not my story.
But now we're the underdogs, and we're the ones who need a handout, so just tell us the answer.
Or have you forgotten where you come from?
I'm not gonna help you.
I told you that was not gonna work.
Stop the clock.
We're here, and we have the solution.
First, you weigh six versus six.
Wrong.
That'll never work.
You just wasted your time and mine.
Click!
I just captured the exact moment when you realized you had failed.
I guess we all got something out of this.
So that's it?
This problem is beyond all of you?
No one solved it.
Believe me.
No one is more disappointed in me than me.
"Than I," Santiago.
Click.
Hi there.
Yeah, that's us.
Home sweet home.
Got dem wings.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Okay.
Boom, right there, behind the bar.
That's my dad's type.
Oh, he likes 'em neat and clean, real tidy.
What?
No, blondes.
He likes blondes.
All right, here's the plan.
We're gonna go sit down, order a couple of drinks, grab her fingerprints off the glass she serves us, and then measure her wrist for handcuff size.
Ready?
Yeah.
Oh, crazy flight.
Oh, those hydraulics were loud.
Yeah.
Ah, bonjour, bonjour.
Two whiskeys, please, Chantelle.
Thanks.
Say, I'm looking for an old sky pal of mine.
Do you know Roger Peralta?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
How do you guys know Peralta?
Oh, I used to fly with him back in Oregon.
My name's Captain Spike Masters.
This is my co-pilot Wanda Cohen.
I drive the plane when he sleeps.
I also take care of hotel accommodations.
Where'd you guys say you flew in from?
Akron.
Luxembourg.
Connected in Akron.
Took the old 78 9er on the wind stream.
You know, flight stuff.
Anyhow Can we grab those two whiskeys, please?
I do not know who you are, and I do not think you are pilots.
Your suit doesn't even fit.
Ah.
I had my stomach stapled.
SÃ©curitÃ©!
SÃ©curitÃ©!
Ah!
Unhand us.
This is outrageous.
I demand to speak with the commodore himself.
There's no way we'll get her fingerprints now.
Oh, really?
VoilÃ .
French.
She cleaned the bar quite thoroughly, but this bottle is filthy with her prints.
Smurt.
That's why you're the pilot, and I'm the co-pilot.
Copy that, Wanda.
Copy that.
Wanda Cohen.
Wait, Captain.
Gina and I figured out your dumb brain teaser.
I highly doubt that, sir.
I'll judge for myself, Santiago.
Okay, Diaz.
What's the solution?
We have no idea.
Ha!
Told ya.
But neither do you, sir.
What?
Captain Holt, you don't know what the solution is.
Excuse me?
Here's how we cracked it.
I took the photo of you demolishing Amy's spirit and made these clever T-shirts that say, "#nerdfail".
It's not that clever.
It's hilarious.
Look at this.
Your expression is the same as Amy's because you're both devastated that you just let down your mentors.
I looked at your calendar.
You're supposed to have breakfast with your old c.o. You wanted us to solve the problem before you saw him.
That's crazy.
She's right.
What?
No.
He posed that problem to me Every time I see him, he asks, "Do you have the answer yet"?
And I never have.
Those islanders and their pathetic seesaw haunt my dreams.
They mock me in my sleep, riding up and down on a teeter-totter of taunts.
Cool.
So who gets the BeyoncÃ© tickets?
O Canada You home of crappy cops Guess who just freed his dad from Canadian prison and slammed six free mimosas on the first-class flight home sans the juice?
Spoiler alert, it was Jake.
It was me.
So turns out my dad's sidepiece framed him.
She was hella pissed 'cause she found out about his real girlfriend and his other sidepiece.
So yeah.
Turns out my dad is a great guy after all.
And in celebration of my freedom, I'm taking everybody out tonight.
Drinks are on me.
Eh?
Where's Scully?
Scully.
Oh, no.
Who?
Hey, Hank.
When you see my dad walk in, can you dim the lights and play We Are the Champions?
No.
I don't know what your dad looks like, I don't have the song And the lights aren't on dimmers.
Oh, no.
It's okay, Jake.
You give me the signal, I'll start unscrewing bulbs.
No, my dad just texted.
He's not coming.
To Jake's dad!
Yep.
Sorry, Jake.
I'm sure your dad has a really good reason for not being here.
No, don't do that, all right?
Don't let him off the hook.
That's what I've done my whole life.
You know, when he missed my 11th birthday, I blamed myself for being born on a peak travel day.
You were right about him, Boyle.
So what do we do now?
Hug for ten minutes.
No, give me a rain check on the hug.
There's something I got to do.
You can have my beer.
Cool.
Jake.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the party.
I'm subbing for a buddy who's got an early flight.
I'm sure you're upset.
No, actually, I'm not upset at all.
Yeah?
Great.
No, more relieved.
You know, you were always my hero, but I think I'm finally starting to see you for who you really are: A regional airline pilot whose landings are bumpy as hell and a pretty selfish guy who genuinely doesn't care about being a dad.
Jake, you don't understand.
There was a downdraft on the Drummondville runway.
Oh, wow.
It's not my fault.
Yeah, clearly.
Look, I've been making excuses for you my whole life, but you're a pretty crappy father, and until you're ready to be a good one, don't call me.
Also I'm taking your captain hat because it's cool, and I want it.
Going up to the spirit in the sky Spirit in the sky That's where I'm gonna go when I die I got to say, figuring out Captain Holt didn't know the answer was an incredible solve.
I'm sorry if we implied you weren't smart.
Oh, and I'm sorry if we implied you're both asexual nerds who can only be friends with service animals.
You didn't.
Not to your face, but to a ton of people behind your back.
Thanks for the drink.
Yes.
Next round's on me.
It's the least I can do for teasing your brains so mercilessly.
So what are you gonna say to your old c.o. tomorrow when he asks if you've solved the puzzle?
I don't know.
Thanks for bringing that up.
Fun chat.
Just say you're a captain now, and you're busy running a precinct, so he can go suck an egg.
Or we can all work together all night long, and I'm sure we can eventually figure it out.
I like that, Terry.
It shows real heart.
But I'm going with Gina's "suck an egg" idea.
You get the BeyoncÃ© tickets.
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Of course I do.
I told you.
It was my birthright, you bitches.
Superglue your panties to your butts, ladies, because Jake is in the house!
What?
Never mind.
I'm a little drunk.
Ah.
I'm also worried about you.
Come here.
Ten-minute hug time.
I'd rather not.
Come on.
Okay.
Boyle, release him.
Fine, only because you're ordering me to.
There's nine minutes left on that hug.
Great.
Heh.
Nice job in Quebec.
I bet the local cops weren't happy you showed them up.
Yeah, well, maybe not at first.
But by the end, they kept calling me a real bÃ¢tard, which I can only assume means "hero".
It means "bastard," but that's only because they were jealous.
You did good work.
Here.
Is this an allowance?
Are you giving me an allowance?
No, I'm paying the bartender for more drinks.
Oh, right.
I'm proud of you.
Nine minutes start now!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
The muggings were confined to Cabot Street.
They began over two months ago Just like this briefing did.
Please go to charisma class.
I'm here.
I'm here.
Sorry, Charles.
No, Jake.
Never apologize for making an amazing entrance.
My power went out last night, and my alarm didn't go off.
Your alarm is power-dependent?
You brought this on yourself, son.
The point is, it will not happen again.
Carry on.
Sorry I'm late, Sarge.
No hot water this morning.
But I'm here, ready to go.
Will cause no further distractions.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Seriously?
What is your excuse today?
More bad luck.
My car ran out of gas, and then my clothes disappeared from the Laundromat.
I had to beg one of my neighbors to loan me some of his.
You never told us Sinbad lives in your building.
If Sinbad lived in my building, I would have a tattoo on my forehead that said "Sinbad lives in my building".
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, and I'm a half an hour early.
That's right, my string of bad luck has finally come to an end.
Peralta, you failed your drug test.
There were traces of cocaine and methamphetamines - found in your urine.
- What?
Captain, this is insane.
I don't do drugs.
I mean, sure, a couple of my teeth are loose, but that's from dental neglect, not meth.
Yeah, those tests are unreliable.
Okay, let's not blame "tests".
I believe in you, Jake, but come on, he's going after tests.
Sir, listen: the missing laundry, the hot water, the power, the gas, now this?
This is not bad luck, it's a pattern.
Someone's trying to sabotage me.
And who would want to do that?
Probably someone I put away.
It's the only explanation.
Or you didn't pay your bills and you only put a quarter gallon of gas in your tank 'cause you wanted to spend the rest on mini-mart beef jerky.
Wrong, I buy my jerky online from the world's top jerkmasters, so it looks like you need to update your jerk Rolodex, which is not as dirty as it sounds.
Anyway, I can prove that I filled up my tank, all right?
I even have a receipt, because I keep all my receipts like a mature adult person.
Laser tag, wheelie shoes, remote control monster truck, aha!
Gas station.
Someone drained my tank.
Okay, I know you don't do drugs, so maybe there is something to what you're saying.
I'll talk to One Police Plaza and arrange an appeal.
I'll also put someone on this sabotage theory.
I got it.
Jake, when I find whoever did this to you, I'm gonna rip out their eyeballs and fill their sockets I think you might be too close to this.
Copy that.
Santiago, Diaz: look into it.
Noice.
In the meantime, Peralta, you're suspended.
I'm gonna need you to hand in your badge and gun.
All right, fine, you can have my badge and gun, but we're doing it in your office so I can slam them down on your desk and yell out, "The system stinks"!
Actually, the procedure is to bring your gun and badge down to the equipment room on the second floor, fill out form 452-underscore-J, hand said form in to the inventory clerk, and then receive a claim check through interoffice mail.
The system stinks!
Hey, Boyle, any progress with that extortion case you and Jake have been working on?
No, I've just been going over his notes.
Look how cool and illegible his handwriting is.
Oh, I wish I could be that free.
But you know me, ever the calligrapher.
Yeah, well, I thought you might need a little more manpower.
Okay.
So I'm assigning you a new partner.
Actually, partners.
Yep, there's definitely something in there.
Looks like a peanut.
Bet it's a cashew.
You're on.
No, Sarge, come on!
They're terrible.
Stop exaggerating, Boyle.
They're good detectives.
They're fine.
Oh, no.
I pushed it in deeper.
They're all we got.
Sir, Gina's dance concert was last night.
Right.
The Dancy Reagan performance.
I've been so preoccupied with Peralta's drug test, it totally slipped my mind.
Me too.
But don't worry.
I told her we were there.
Was your favorite move "The Gull"?
Or was it "Space Bubbles"?
Oh, I loved them both!
I'm a bubble man and a gull man!
You lied to her?
Like a pro.
I couldn't hurt her feelings.
She really wanted us to be there.
Well, I wish you hadn't involved me in your deception.
I maintain a strict code of integrity.
Come on, Captain.
You never told a white lie to make a person feel better?
I only lie when someone's safety is at risk.
Or if a juvenile aged eight years or younger asks about Santa Claus.
In which case I feed them some reassuring pap about the logical impossibility of proving a negative.
It's sentimental drivel, but they eat it up.
So does this mean you're gonna blow up my spot and tell Gina the truth?
If she asks me, then yes, I suppose I will have to blow your spot right up.
Okay, this is everyone I could think of who would want to mess with my life.
Perps, people I've testified against, the old guy who lived underneath me when I was learning the Gangnam Style dance.
Wow, you've pissed off a lot of people.
Well, that's what happens when you live out loud, Rosa.
We need to look into the power outage and hot water.
Do you have proof you pay your bills?
Are you serious?
Guys, this is not my fault.
My reputation is being sabotaged by some guy.
Or girl, you know.
Monsters can be women too.
Super progressive attitude, Jake.
Look, we are on your side.
It's just, you're not the most responsible person.
We have to do our job.
All right, fine.
You can see my bank records.
But I always pay my power bill.
Often late.
One time in person with Canadian pennies.
Oh, my God, talking about your finances makes me sweat behind the knees.
Nice.
Hey, speaking of funky smells, should we start this investigation at the urinalysis lab?
Hmm?
Take a trip to the old pee factory?
Jake, you're suspended.
Just go home, have a beer, and smash something.
That's what I'd do.
Or take advantage of this amazing city.
Go sightseeing.
MoMA has an exhibit I'm dying to see.
It's all about office chair design.
Oh!
Look, I know technically I'm not supposed to help out, but rules are made to be broken.
They were made to be followed.
Nothing is made to be broken.
Uh, piÃ±atas.
- Glow sticks.
- Karate boards.
Spaghetti when you have a small pot.
Rules.
Look, someone's messing with my life here.
I thought you guys had my back.
We do.
But seriously, you can't come with us.
Okay.
Fine.
I get it.
Protocol's protocol.
I'm gonna go check out that office chair design exhibit at the MoMA.
Rosa?
Amy?
What are you guys doing here?
Our non-suspended jobs.
You're not supposed to be investigating.
I'm not, I'm sightseeing, just as Amy suggested.
At Brooklyn Urine and Blood?
Oh, yeah, the internet says this is the number-one urinalysis lab in all of New York.
Fun tourist selfie!
Boink!
Not your best.
Anyways, I'm gonna take a "walking tour" in here while you guys ask a couple of questions, and also, I've been waiting for 20 minutes.
Where have you been?
We had to find the addresses of all 78 people you said might want to hurt you.
Uh-huh.
And was there another stop along the way?
We got coffee.
Those are cappuccinos.
You know how long it takes to foam that milk?
Time you could have spent on my case, but I guess it's just froth over friends with you two.
Anyways, let's do this.
Jake I can't believe I'm about to say this.
I really wish you could come look at urine with us, but you can't.
You're suspended.
Go home.
All right, fine.
If you guys won't help me, I guess I'll just get myself off.
Context.
Context was important on that one.
I get Greek yogurt, 'cause there's heritage there, but Iceland?
No, no, no, no, no!
Hey, Gina!
What are you guys talking about?
Yogurt?
Me too.
Let's keep talking about that.
Whoo!
Terry's out of breath.
Cool.
I was just dropping off some files.
Great, let's just go out to your desk and let's talk about how that went.
Okay, Terry.
But first, I want to ask the captain for his impresh of my show.
Got any feed-b, or was it just love, love, love?
Well, actually I thought it was amazing!
You were like a swan who went to Juilliard.
It was so good.
Terry, I have already received your praise.
I'm clearly fishing in another pond right now.
I'm putting an end to this.
Sergeant Jeffords and I were unable to attend your performance.
Oh.
But you were so spot on with your compliments.
Terry is a practiced liar.
I'm sorry we missed the show.
I know that dancing is an important hobby to you.
Hobby?
You think my dancing is a hobby?
Oh, yes.
Like me and antique globe collecting.
It's thrilling, but nobody is ever going to pay me for it.
Ergo, a hobby.
I get paid in applause.
But apparently not yours.
I know that maintaining integrity can be difficult, but in the long run, everyone is better for it.
Attention everyone.
The tragic sound you hear is the shredding of my spandie.
Gina Linetti will never dance again.
So those threatening phone calls were being made to Tim Orsk of Tim O's Limos.
That's interesting.
This Orsk guy's name keeps cropping up in this case.
'Cause he's the victim.
You know, he's the guy whose window was smashed with this rock.
Okay?
He's being extorted for $10,000.
Sure, but what do they want from him?
$10,000.
I just said that.
We're trying to figure out who's doing the threatening.
Wait.
I have a theory.
I think "limousine" and "magazine" come from the same word.
Just focus!
I'm sorry for snapping.
I interviewed Orsk Orsk!
There it is again.
Oh, you're useless!
You're completely useless!
You are without a doubt the most incompetent detectives I've ever seen.
And I'm including that bomb-sniffing dog who humps all the bombs!
You know your turning signal's been on for 30 seconds.
I like to announce my turning intention.
This isn't the Indy 500.
Well, when you finally change lanes an hour from now, we should go talk to Jake's super see if there was a power outage.
What?
Oh!
Why would you do that?
I just broke into your car and then popped up without warning.
Not cool.
What the hell are you doing?
I thought I was hitching a ride to Rikers so we could interview some convicts I put away, but apparently you're still wasting time investigating me.
Hey, it's your fault we have to check up on your power outages.
You have three mini-fridges plugged in to the same outlet.
Three mini-fridges are cheaper than one regular one.
We're just doing our jobs.
Why don't you trust us?
How can I?
You didn't even know a man was lying in the backseat of your car.
And while you two were busy lolly-gargling I'm not familiar with the expression I was investigating.
I'll send you some selfies.
Look, we're gonna get to your list.
We just have to rule out other possibilities first.
You know, there is a real chance that no one is after you.
Yeah, but I'm telling you that someone is.
That should be enough.
And we told you to trust us.
That should be enough.
All right, fine.
You don't want my help?
You're not gonna get it.
Dude In fact, I'm deleting your numbers from my phone.
Just let us take you home.
See you never.
Fine.
Where am I?
Hello, Peralta.
Geoffrey Hoytsman?
You're the one who's been sabotaging me?
I'm just ruining your life like you ruined mine.
You never should have arrested me.
But I basically got your cocaine charges dropped.
You only had to do 40 hours of community service.
Right, but I wanted to get them all done at once, so for energy, I did way too much cocaine and meth.
Went on a prolonged psychotic episode involving assault, public fornication, and, apparently, the touching of my scrotum to every doorknob in a synagogue.
And you know what happened then?
They thoroughly cleaned the synagogue, you landed on your feet and pursued your true passion of selling ice cream?
None of that.
I lost my job and my wife and my home.
An ex-client lent me this truck.
He likes me because I got him off on a strangle-and-mangle.
You have a phrase for that?
I used to, when I was an awesome lawyer.
Now I'm just another idiot living in an ice cream truck.
So that's why you put drugs in my urine.
Hey, that was my urine.
Your urine is in there.
Why would you keep my pee?
I need belongings, Jake, to feel like a man.
Look, this is a bad idea, Hoytsman.
People are gonna notice if I disappear.
See?
Someone's already looking for me.
You're in big trouble, buddy.
Your e-coupon for Big Mike's Calzones expires today.
You're damn right.
And if I don't redeem that, Big Mike is gonna get real suspicious.
Big Mike is a cartoon with pizzas for eyes.
All right, fine.
Maybe not Big Mike, but someone will.
Shut up, Peralta!
Oh, boy.
Captain Holt, here's your CompStat report.
This is how I move now.
Walking is too close to dancing, and there's no more dance in me.
Plus I'm hoping my leg muscles will atrophy so I won't be tempted to use them.
I bet you feel real good about calling her dancing hobby, huh?
Sarcasm the coward's lie.
I don't get it.
Gina's always so sure of herself.
She usually doesn't care at all what people say or think about her.
Maybe not with most people, Captain.
But she cares what you think.
Fine.
I regret what I said.
But now, I don't know how to make it right with her.
Lie!
Look, yesterday I told my twins there were baby bunnies in their stomachs to get them to eat lettuce.
And that worked?
Yeah, but then they refused to drink their milk because they thought the bunnies would drown.
So I bought a couple rabbits and told the girls that they hopped out of their mouths while they slept.
I've lost track of your point.
They ate their lettuce, I'm stuck with two bunnies, and lying works!
Pretty good gag, huh?
A prostitute taught me how to make it.
Ugh.
Where were you?
You were gone for three hours.
I know because I sang "This Is How We Do It" 143 times.
Okay, well, I had to grab a few things at the art supply store.
Kidnapping is 90% crafting.
Jake, you're gonna help me get my life back.
You're gonna confess, on video, to framing me for everything that got me in trouble.
And why would I do that?
Because I'm high on bath salts, emotionally unstable, and pointing a gun at you.
Let's make a movie!
Hey, Boyle, guess who caught the Tim O's Limos perp.
Jake?
Is Jake back?
No, we did.
Scully and Hitchcock.
Signed confession.
You called us useless.
You called us incompetent.
You called us zeros in the sack.
Never happened.
Well, someone said it to me last night.
Oh, uh, must have been my wife.
How did you solve the case?
We listened to those voicemails again and noticed the sound of parrots in the background.
Got a list of employees, did door duty asking neighbors if any of them kept pet birds.
We finally found one who did, and guess what.
The landscaping in front of his building was covered with these.
Same type of rock that was thrown through the window.
I can't believe it.
What, you don't think it could break one?
Watch.
I meant I can't believe you solved the case.
Well, you were wrong on that too.
Hi.
My name is Jake Peralta, and this is my confession.
I destroyed the good name of an American hero Geoffrey Hoytsman.
I framed him for drug possession, I got him fired from his job, and I planted his scrotal prints on the synagogue doorknobs.
Great, now just eighty more confessions to go.
You've been very naughty.
I threatened to blow Mr. Hoytsman's head off if he didn't quote-unquote "really cheap out on his dad's funeral".
And while he slept, I logged in to Hoytsman's computer and flooded it with Thai pornography.
Starts crying.
"Starts crying" is a stage direction, you imbecile!
Also, I fathered two children with Hoytsman's cleaning lady, and it was I, disguised as Geoffrey, who spoke against her at her political asylum hearing.
God.
You did it, not me.
I am a horrible person who has done horrible things to a truly decent man, which is why I've decided to take my own life.
Wait, no, I didn't decide that.
Spoiler alert!
Decided to take my own life.
That last take sounded great.
You really brought my words to life.
You know, I should write more.
What a rush!
Hoytsman, you don't have to do this.
Your life's not so bad.
Living in an ice cream truck?
Never showering?
That was my childhood dream.
I had everything.
I had friends, a wife, two beautiful children out of three total.
Not a bad ratio.
And now I have nothing and no one.
Look, I get it.
I know what that feels like.
You've only lived in an ice cream truck for part of one day!
How could you possibly know?
Well, I know no one's coming to rescue me.
I was so concerned with saving myself and my reputation I pushed all my friends away.
Wow.
Sounds like you're having a breakthrough.
You should act on this.
You still have time to make it right.
Really?
You're not gonna kill me?
Oh, jeez.
I totally forgot.
Thanks for reminding me.
Of course I'm gonna kill you.
Drugs make me say such silly things.
Drugs are so silly.
Ooh, I'm gonna do some right now.
- Hoytsman.
- What?
- Hyah!
- Oh!
God!
That's my nose!
That's where I put the drugs in!
- Gyah!
- Oh!
So long, Hoytsman.
Hyah!
I can't move!
I'm turtling.
I'm turtling!
Nice try, Jake.
Get up!
I can't.
Oh.
Yeah.
Okay.
My bad.
What's this?
I'm selling my smoke machine, glitter cannon, and castanets.
I would've put my soul on there, but that was shredded along with my spandies.
Gina, I want to tell you something.
Dancing is more than just a hobby for you.
It's a profession.
Oh, so you're a liar like Terry now?
No, I'm no bunny-buying coward.
You are a professional dancer, because I'm paying Dancy Reagan to perform two shows at our at-risk youth program.
Congratulations.
Thank you, Captain.
You just made me the happiest, prettiest, most talented girl in the world.
This is the best $8,000 you ever spent.
It's $200.
I'm sure you're good for the rest.
Captain loves my dancing.
This is why you're alone, Jake.
We were bonding, talking about our pain, and you pull a stunt like that?
You were gonna kill me.
Deflect, deflect, deflect.
This is why everyone hates you.
You open?
Okay.
You keep it shut.
I really need this sale.
Hello, ma whoa!
Don't hurt me!
I'm someone's little boy.
Geoffrey Hoytsman, you're under arrest.
Ow.
Oh, I am so relieved you guys found me.
Wait, how did you find me?
You hadn't done anything super annoying to us for, like, five hours, so we knew something was wrong.
Oh, that's very insulting but dead on.
We looked through those irritating selfies you sent us, and in the background of three of them was an ice cream truck.
We ran the plates and put out an APB.
I'm sorry we doubted anybody was sabotaging you.
No, I'm the one who should apologize.
For some reason, I have trouble believing people actually have my back.
I don't know why.
Probably my dad abandoning me.
Maybe something I should work out in therapy, but who has an hour to spare once every two weeks, right?
Anyways, I'm sorry I acted like a jackass.
Wow, Jake, you're so sincere since you got off coke.
And meth.
That was the hard one to kick.
No, the hard one to kick is angel dust, which is why I am locked in for life.
Hey.
I double checked your evidence.
Everything looks good.
I got to say you guys are good cops.
Hyeah, no doy!
How do you think we got to be the oldest guys here?
By never being promoted and losing all your money to divorces?
And bad investments.
Anyway, I'm sorry for calling you useless.
I'm gonna make sure everyone knows you did good.
- Boyle, please don't.
- Don't?
The last thing we need is to suddenly be on everyone's A list.
The ones to watch.
The golden boys.
Pair of red hot dicks.
No one calls detectives that anymore.
People call detectives that?
All that investigating was exhausting.
Besides, we did our share of that in the '70s and '80s.
Now we like to do paperwork in our comfy chairs.
If we're away from our desks for too long, they'll update our computers, and we'll lose Minesweeper.
So please, don't tell anyone about the amazing work we did today.
I never said "amazing".
You kind of just did your jobs.
There you go.
No, really.
I mean, you also broke a window.
Now you get it.
Your suspension has been lifted, Peralta.
Well, that's great news, sir.
And now it is time for the traditional handing back of gun and badge to the vindicated hero ceremony.
Everyone in!
I don't have your gun or your badge.
Just take form 891-underscore-J down to the equipment room and retrieve your things there.
I'm sorry, but that's unacceptable.
Come on, Captain.
I need this.
We all need this!
Fine.
Fine.
If this will make you happy I believe these belong to you.
Congratulations.
That's very nice.
Thank you.
But as I've said before, the system stinks, and this isn't over.
I say we march down to city hall!
Get out of my office.
Yup.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Heads up there's our perp, looking all perpy, just perping his way down Perp Street.
- Take a picture!
- Give me one second.
This light is really unflattering for his complexion.
It doesn't have to be perfect.
Tom Olson is a bad dude.
He's held up four electronic stores at gunpoint.
Man, I wish you hadn't read that Annie Leibovitz book.
Quit calling it a book.
It was a visual journey.
You probably think I should shoot this in color instead of black and white.
Yes!
Shoot color!
Why have you been shooting black and white?
Wait.
Where's he going now?
Come on.
Damn it.
NYPD!
Freeze!
He's trapped!
Top-of-car foot chase!
My birthday wish finally came true!
Keep it up, Jake!
He's yours!
He's yours!
He's yours!
I know!
I feel like the coolest person in New York City!
Ooh, nice pimp walk, pimp.
Well, thank you, pimpin' playa.
Whoa.
That is not a pimp walk.
That's a limp walk.
You sure you should be here today, Jake?
I mean, you wiped out hard.
It wasn't so much a wipeout as it was a controlled power fall, Sarge.
Well That's his disagreement squeak.
You wiped out.
What'd the doctor say?
Welcome; We haven't seen you in 11 years.
Haven't been to the doctor in 11 years.
How trill is that?
Your tone's braggy, but your words are real sad.
Hmm.
Did he clear you for active duty?
First of all, the doctor was a woman.
There's a such thing as women doctors, Sarge.
I lied for effect.
It was a man.
And he said that I was perfectly fine, except for three cracked ribs and a broken toe, which were right next to two other broken toes.
Did he clear you or not?
He did not.
All right.
Let's get to work, guys.
We got a perp to catch.
Oh, forget that.
Uh-uh.
No.
Look.
There's a APB out for your guy.
Lots of cops are looking for him.
You don't need to be here.
Sarge, I know this case better than anyone, and I am this close to solving it.
Your fingers are really far apart.
Yeah, I also have a hairline fracture in my thumb.
Mankind's least important finger am I right?
Sarge, please.
Please.
Please, please, please.
Just let me stay on the case, all right?
I promise I won't go into the field or do anything dangerous.
Fine.
You can work the case from right here, but you are tied to your desk.
Ooh.
Tied to my desk.
Mr. Grey will see you now, Sarge.
You wanted to see me, sir?
We have a situation, and it's bad.
Check your e-mail.
- No.
- Yes.
Kevin insists on you and Marcus joining us for dinner at our house.
But we agreed to keep our personal and professional lives separate.
It is weird enough I am dating your nephew without dragging your husband and dog into it.
You think I want this?
Because I do not want this.
Sadly, Marcus and Kevin can be held off no longer.
Okay.
So what's our play here?
My stomach's a little off.
I could say I'm sick.
Well, I've used the sick excuse for you eight times.
I think they're catching on.
You could say you're sick.
No one would ever believe that.
No.
This is happening.
But don't worry.
I have a plan to keep things from getting too personal.
I'm inviting some intimacy buffers.
Dinner party at your house?
Oh, mama!
I will be there.
All I ask is that you clear the furniture out of your living room so I can show Kev some of my new dance opera.
Why just some of it?
Do the whole thing.
Yes; Nothing would make me happier.
See you Thursday at 8:00.
Copy that, Cap-i-tan!
Later, skater.
Yes.
This is wonderful.
The dinner's not for four days, and you're already freaking out.
Excuse me.
Did you not just hear me say, "Later, skater"?
All right.
Fine.
There's a slight chance that, in the past, I may have tried a little too hard around the captain.
So this time, I'm gonna be super chill.
Good plan.
Whoa!
It just says you got uninvited.
What?
Oh, honey.
Oh.
I get it.
You're joking.
See?
I'm cool.
I get jokes.
Boyle, have you seen Jake?
No.
I was out getting him some healing broth.
I was torn between chicken or beef, but then it hit me.
Goat!
What happened?
I heard a bang!
No.
No bang.
Everything's totally normal.
Really?
It looks, to me, like you did something stupid like try to lift a heavy box.
Sarge, come on.
In my condition?
Suck it, MacGyver.
Pretty elegant solution, right?
No!
Everything fell everywhere.
All you had to do was sit at your desk.
What is your problem?
I don't have a problem.
I'm just trying to solve this case, and everyone's making a huge deal because I have a few minor injuries to my ribs, ankle, hand, toes, and jaw.
- Jaw?
- Yeah, that just happened.
I got hit in the face with a box.
But look.
I'm fine.
- I promise you.
- No, you're not.
I'm done with this, Peralta.
Go home and get better.
Now!
All right, fine.
But I'm taking this box of evidence with me.
If you can pick it up, you can take it.
Deal.
See?
I'm fine.
Yo, yo, yo!
Miss me, miss me, now you got to kiss me!
I'm talking to you.
Jake, what are you doing here?
It's only been four days.
You're supposed to take a full week off of work.
Come on, Sarge.
Does it look like I'm on the job?
Okay then.
What are you doing here?
Taking your advice to rest and relax to the next level.
Swinging by to pick up Charles, and then we're headed to sunny, beachy, only recently devastated by a financial crisis Atlantic cit-ay!
That's right, suckers.
Jake and I are going on the coolest vacation ever.
Official trip nickname: AC/DC.
Atlantic City Dudes Club.
Yeah.
That's gonna change.
But check it out, Sarge.
Boyle and I are staying at The Ravenna Damn.
This place is luxe.
Yeah, I've been trying to get Jake down there forever.
Had I known all it'd take was a few broken bones, I would've hit him with a baseball bat years ago!
Mm-mm.
Sarge, it's a spa and a casino.
A spasino!
One of the room service options is a carving station.
Talking prime rib in bed And what's this?
I'm using a blanket as a napkin.
That's fancy.
That's fancy.
Real fancy.
All right.
Well, that sounds good, Jake.
Sounds like you guys are gonna have fun.
Oh oh, we will 'cause we're staying at The Ravenna Jake, this is not the Ravenna.
No, it is not, but it is the world-famous Seafam Motel!
I think the "O" fell off.
Pretty cool, right?
The Ravenna had a four-star restaurant.
This place has a weird amount of dead seagulls, even for AC.
All right.
Fine.
It's not a vacation.
It's a stakeout.
My perp has a brother who lives in this dump, and I think he's hiding out with him here.
Seriously?
I was looking forward to this trip.
I can't believe you lied to me.
It wasn't a lie.
It was an illusion!
All right.
It was a lie.
I'm sorry.
I had to make it sound really cool so you'd drop everything and come with me.
I can't let Olson walk, and I can't catch him alone.
Plus, this is gonna be super fun!
New trip nickname: AC/DC.
Atlantic City Detectives Club.
Oh Okay!
Fine!
You know I can't say no to a good trip nickname.
There he is.
Ugh!
Arm!
Rib!
Arm!
Rib!
Shoulder?
Ooh.
Marcus.
Detective Diaz.
What a surprise.
I didn't expect you for another 9 1/2 minutes.
See?
Told you it was rude to be early.
Well, let's cancel the entire evening and try again next year.
Hey.
She is hilarious.
I thought you might need some help setting up.
Oh, I'll put these in some water.
Thank you.
Marcus, you can help with the boeuf bourguignon.
I subbed shallots for onions in the mirepoix.
No!
Are you kidding?
I have no idea what he's talking about.
I'm sorry.
We're screwed.
I should just break up with him.
No, no, no, no.
Santiago is always on time.
We only have to make small talk for We better keep it impersonal.
Acceptable topics include what constitutes a grain, the Hubble Space Telescope, orchid varietals, the birth of the transistor We only have to fill 8 minutes.
Sure, but think about it as 480 seconds, and you'll see why I'm concerned.
Oh, my God.
Uh-oh, Amy.
Train's moving real slow.
We're gonna be epically late.
Keep your reaction short and to the point.
I'm running out of mem.
Sorry, Gina.
I hope we're late.
That's how the fashionable crowd lives.
I told you tonight, I'm gonna have fun.
What?
I'm being chill.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Because something stinks, and it's definitely the food you brought.
I think it smells great.
It's my mom's famous nicoise salad.
Amy, all your cooking stinks.
Why would you even get involved with tuna and egg?
No one else seems to mind it.
We mind!
We really, really mind.
Just throw it out.
I will not throw it out, but I will open a window because I'm a nice person.
And I'm an even nicer person!
Bye-bye, salad!
No!
Yo!
Still no movement.
How was the snack machine?
Ah.
Snacks abound!
Told you this place was awesome.
My theory is that Olson and his brother have been using it as a home base while they rob places up and down the coast.
Fascinating.
Fascinating.
Do you desire a crispened potato?
Ah, don't mind if I dooble.
Wait a minute.
"Crispened potato".
Why are you fancy-talking?
How dare you, sir?
I speak the common tongue.
There it is again.
You only do that when you're lying or hiding something.
Hiding?
Ha!
Pish-posh!
Housekeeping!
That's not housekeeping!
That's betrayal!
I can't believe you called the sarge!
Hey, Sarge.
Don't "Hey, Sarge," me, Peralta!
I'm about to break the rest of your damn body!
Okay.
Fine.
I accept my fate.
Just take a picture of my penis first, for posterity, and then do what you must.
Amy says that we should start dinner without her.
Then she writes, "Whatevs," colon, hyphen, closed parenthesis.
Great.
It's much nicer just the four of us.
I mean, we can really get into it.
Yeah, let's do just that.
So Marcus, what orchids can you name?
Oh, that's easy.
None.
Uh, well, here are the orchids that I can name.
Beclardia, Beloglottis, Benthamia, Diphylax, Dipodium, Evotella Raymond, you know how much I love hearing you talk about orchids Great.
Then there's Eriaxis But I would love to hear more about our guest.
Rosa, tell us about your family.
I have one.
You got to give him more deets than that.
Her father's a teacher.
They're from Bensonhurst.
Speaking of which, have they finished repairing the Hubble Space Telescope?
Yes.
Six years ago.
So do you have siblings?
I have two sisters.
I have to leave this.
Phew!
Great idea.
Take a breather.
That was way too personal.
No one needs to know you have sisters.
New topic: The moons of Jupiter.
I think I might be pregnant.
Oh.
Oh Oh, n No.
I came down here to stop you from doing something stupid.
I called the ACPD and told them we had a possible perp at this motel.
They're sending a squad car.
Wow, Boyle.
The fact that you would sell me out after I brought you to Atlantic City on a half-expenses-paid, best-friend trip.
I know.
I'm sorry.
It's just I was worried about you getting hurt.
No, Charles!
Don't apologize!
We're mad at him!
I had to miss family dinner to drive my ass out here.
Well, no one asked you to do that.
Actually, I did.
Remember?
I betrayed you.
Charles, what are you doing, bud?
I just dug you out of this.
Peralta, we're going home as soon as that squad car gets here.
Until then, you sit tight.
You're on time out.
That's your time-out chair.
Fine, but first, I have to go to the bathroom.
And it will be work, due to my injured tailbone and bruised bladder.
What the hell?
Oh.
Please be Olson.
Please be Olson.
Please be Olson.
You're not Olson.
Oh, no.
Uh-oh.
I should be at home, taking care of my real babies.
Not some big, dumb work baby.
I know you're upset, Sarge, but I think the fact that you came all the way down here has really taught Jake a lesson.
Help!
And I'm wrong.
He's done something dumb.
- Help!
Help!
- Cover yourself, Jake.
It's your friend Charles Boyle from work!
Hey, guys.
What the hell are you doing out there, Peralta?
Would you believe that my urine stream was so powerful that it - No!
- Okay.
I thought I saw our perp, and I know I'm not supposed to be working, but technically, I wasn't working because it wasn't our guy.
Get out of the bathroom!
Yeah.
We're gonna go sit on those gross beds and talk about the fact that you have a real problem!
Okay, I get that you're mad, and we are definitely gonna talk, but I still haven't, technically, gotten to go pee, so if you wouldn't mind I don't care.
You have lost the right to pee.
You can fidget, little man.
Well, it's gonna be on you when we're all covered in my whiz.
Get your ass out there.
Are your bosoms tender?
I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.
Are your senses heightened?
I think I might be pregnant, not bitten by a radioactive spider.
Kevin asked me about my sister.
She just told me she's pregnant, and that made me think I've been feeling run down lately, my stomach's been weird, and I just did the math in my head and I think I'm a little bit late.
Late to Oh, right.
Right.
Your What if I'm pregnant?
Do I tell Marcus?
What do I do with a baby?
How do you take care of those things?
Why are their heads so soft?
Before you spiral any more, you should take a pregnancy test.
Yes.
Smart.
Immediately.
Oh.
Immediately immediately.
Very well.
I'll figure out a way to get you out of here without arousing suspicion.
Now I'm regretting blowing through my orchid material so quickly.
Jake, you put work ahead of everything else, and it's not healthy.
Remember Cagney and Lacey's third birthday party?
I hired you as Jakels the Clown.
How'd that go?
And Jeremy the giraffe has a very long neck!
That's it.
That little girl was strangled!
You were thinking that at a kid's party.
Life is more than just whatever case you're working on.
If you don't figure out how to balance things, you're gonna burn out or get hurt.
Oh, look.
You did get hurt.
Okay!
Fine.
You guys make some great points, but counterpoint: I am right all the time.
There's our perp.
All right.
Let's go!
Jake!
Observe him from a safe distance while we wait for the Atlantic City PD to show up.
My exact instinct as well, Sarge.
Good thinking.
Oh, no.
Are you certain we have to cut the party short?
Yes; Unfortunately, Detective Diaz has an unexpected emergency to take care of.
All right.
Do you need to go as well?
No; It's not quite captain-worthy.
But still advanced enough that Detective Diaz's talents are best qualified to handle the Non-emergency emergency.
Yes.
Precisely.
See?
She's great.
I should go do that.
Now.
Yes.
- Hey.
What's up?
- Hi.
Sorry we're so late.
Actually, the party is over.
What?
The party is over!
Oh, I see.
You heard me.
You were just taken by surprise.
Very well.
Good night.
But oh!
All I wanted to do was impress Captain Holt, and you know what?
It didn't matter.
It didn't matter that we were late, it didn't matter that I was chill, and it didn't matter that the rats ate my salad.
Oh, no.
I definitely saw them running away from it.
You know what, my friend?
It's time to be chill for real.
Mmm.
Yes, Gaga!
Yes!
That's the spirit!
We should go.
Yep.
Damn ACPD.
They should be here by now.
He's looking at us.
Pretend to use the ice machine, Boyle.
Gladly!
Why is it so fun to get hotel ice?
It feels wasteful, but also, like, "I bought this room.
I deserve this ice".
Shh!
He's on the move.
Okay.
I'll follow him till the ACPD get here.
Damn it!
Stay put, Peralta!
I will!
Don't worry!
I'm just gonna let Sarge follow him.
I'm gonna stay right here.
I can't do it.
I'm gonna cut him off in the alley!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ha!
Shortcut!
You just got Jaked!
Oh!
Oh, Jake!
Oh!
Ooh!
Jake!
You okay?
No, Sarge.
I got hit by a car!
You happy now?
Broken ribs and a million broken toes weren't enough for you?
In retrospect, they were plenty.
Yes.
The worst part is, Olson got away.
That's the worst part?
You could've died, man.
I wasn't hurt that badly.
The doctor said all my bleeding was internal.
That's where the blood's supposed to be.
Look, I know you're angry because I disrespected you as a boss.
No!
I'm upset my friend doesn't want my help because he insists on being an idiot!
You know what?
You're a lost cause.
I'm done trying to help you.
Terry's leaving.
Wait.
My second year on the force, I was working a drug case, tracking this drug dealer for months.
Then, suddenly, he disappeared right before Memorial Day, which I was supposed to take off for a guys' weekend with some friends.
But how?
We didn't know each other yet.
Oh.
Other friends.
While I was gone, the dude resurfaced and got into a shootout with another drug dealer.
Two civilians got shot.
Meanwhile I was sipping piÃ±a coladas in Philly.
From that day on, I vowed to never take time off during a case.
Also, I don't love Philly.
Jake, I get it.
- Philly sucks.
- Yeah.
But why didn't you ever tell us?
I was embarrassed about the choice I made.
People got hurt because of me.
Perps get away.
People get hurt.
That's part of the job.
But if you don't give yourself a break, you'll be no use to anyone.
Because you'll be dead.
Real talk alert!
Okay.
I get it.
I'd give you a hug, but right now, my body has the structural integrity of a chocolate soufflÃ©.
Ooh!
I am so hungover.
Did we steal these sunglasses last night?
No.
You paid the bodega guy $200 for them.
And his shirt.
Ooh.
That explains why I have a triple XL Scarface hoodie on my couch.
Eh, worth it.
It was a pretty fun night.
Hey, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for cancelling the party so abruptly.
There was a non-emergency emergency.
Your loss.
Amy made a salad and a cake, and they were Amazing.
Well, let's put a make-up dinner in the calendar.
Or we could just go with the flow.
See what happens.
I don't give a what?
Too much.
I mean, that would be great.
Thank you, sir.
Captain.
Detective Diaz.
I'm not pregnant.
I see.
I just wanted to say thank you.
Talking to you was really helpful.
Maybe mixing our personal and professional lives isn't as disgusting as it sounds.
Yes, I agree.
And I'm glad I could help.
Now, let's never talk about Stop pointing at it.
Yes.
Of course.
Um Dismissed?
Yo!
Welcome back, Peralta.
You look rested.
Thank you.
I am.
I caught up on a lot of very important daytime television.
I tried grapefruit juice for the first time terrible and one day, I even bought the newspaper.
It was raining, and I needed a cheap umbrella.
Impressive.
And how's your broken everything?
Doctor gave me the all-clear to come back to work, and I'm allowed to have light, non-strenuous sex, provided I stretch before and after.
Nice.
Well, it's great to have you back.
Your perp got picked up by some uniforms in the Seven-Eight, but I have a couple other B&Es you could jump on.
Oh, actually, Sarge, I'm not back-back just yet.
I decided to take two more vacation days.
A friend of mine said I needed to experience life outside of work.
Smart friend.
Anyways, I figured I owed Boyle a legit trip to AC, so.
That's right, y'all!
It's time for AC/ Part Two.
Atlantic City Destruction Crew.
Actually, not bad.
Because we are going to destroy eight different taffy crawls and one "Ghosts of the Boardwalk" bus tour!
Not where I saw that going, but I'm still excited!
Ha ho!
This is gonna be epic, bro!
Quick, Sarge!
Punch me in the ribs as hard as you can!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Oh, my God!
Rosa's wearing pink!
Rosa's wearing pink!
Are we sure it's not a white shirt that's just been bloodied in a motorcycle crash?
Maybe it wasn't her.
Does she have a twin sister?
If Rosa had a twin, she would have eaten her in the womb.
Wait.
Hold it.
Stop.
How come none of you teased her about it?
It's Rosa.
She's scary.
You guys are unbelievable.
I once wore a tie with a splash of purple.
You guys called me Mr. Grapes for two years.
Oh, Mr. Grapes.
I forgot about Mr. Grapes.
If I wore a pink shirt, you'd tear me to shreds.
Well, yeah, but you'd look like a My Little Pony with a gun.
Let me guess.
Your theater club is putting on Grease, and you're playing a pink lady.
What are you guys laughing at?
If Boyle was wearing a pink shirt.
I get it.
That's hilarious.
What's happening?
Rosa is the one wearing pink.
And?
It's gorgeous.
I wish I could pull that off Dream on, Strawberry Shortcake.
Yeah, nice try, Mr. Grapes.
Mr. Grapes.
Mr. Grapes!
Last night, several masked men robbed a number of check cashing locations in our precinct.
They also hit several locations in the Nine-Three, so this will be a joint investigation.
Detective David Majors is already on the case.
Whoa, Dave Majors?
Seriously?
Who's that?
He's The best detective in the NYPD, myself included.
His arrest numbers are staggering.
His conviction rate is magnificent.
He is blotter dynamite.
I mean, I'm cool.
I'm just hanging out with you guys.
Okay, but what's his body like on a scale from Charles to Terry?
Sorry, buddy.
What?
I'm the ten.
Sure you are.
Majors does just fine.
His girlfriend is the weather lady from channel five.
You know, the one who's always reaching for Cooperstown?
Love her.
Well, I need someone to partner up with him.
- Ooh, me, me, me, me, me.
- Oh, I'll do it.
Sir, with all due respect, I'm the obvious choice.
I mean, look at me.
I'm not in profile.
Sir, please let the record show that the sauce on his face is from yesterday.
And it is that level of eagle-eyed observation that I plan to bring to Enough.
You can both work the case.
Three heads are better than two.
Also, I fear any other decision I make will just result in further noise.
Good call, sir.
I was about to start chanting, "Vote for Jake".
Let's do it anyway.
Vote for Jake.
Vote for Jake.
- Dismissed.
- Yeah.
Code Chartreuse.
I repeat, Code Chartreuse.
Gina, for the last time, please limit your alerts to ROY-G-BIV.
Disappointing.
"Code Chartreuse" means "the recruiter from Copperhead Security, Gary Shaw, is here".
Gary Shaw has attempted to pry me away from the NYPD for eight years.
When he makes his offer, I know just what I'll say: Never is not just a crater on Mars.
Of course, it is a crater on Mars.
That's hilarious.
It's not meant to be funny, Boyle.
It's meant to be devastating.
Captain Holt, good to see you.
Mr. Shaw, let's just cut to the chase: Never is not just a crater on Mars.
Of course, it is a crater on Mars.
Well, actually, I'm not here for you.
A member of your squad reached out to me, a Sergeant Terry Jeffords.
Oh.
Oh, I see.
Well, Sergeant Jeffords is out there.
Thank you, Captain.
There's my guy Terry the tank.
What?
Guys.
What?
Guys.
Terry called him?
He's shaking Terry's hand.
Now I'm just describing everything that's happening?
What the hell is going on?
I do not know.
And now Captain Holt doesn't know.
Well, well, well, what do we have here?
Oh, Majors isn't here yet?
I wasted all that coolness on a bunch of nobodies.
I'm just gonna reset.
Jake, he's a highly decorated detective.
He's not gonna be impressed by your sunglass choreography.
He's gonna be too distracted by my notebook flip.
Shut up.
Shut up.
He's here.
Hey, you must be the Nine-Nine.
- I'm Majors.
- Hey.
Peralta.
This is Santiago.
Well, well, well, what do we have here?
You mean here in my notebook?
I looked into the baby masks the perps were wearing, and no stores in the tri-state area sell them.
Reminds me of a murder I worked a few years back.
Perp always wore these weird masks We couldn't figure out where he bought them.
Turns out he was making his own masks from human skin.
No.
That is so awesome.
Really, Amy?
For whom?
Sounds to me like those face masks were once somebody's face faces.
That's true, Peralta.
I think about that every day.
You and me both.
Ahh.
Okay, I'm gonna look around, take a few statements.
Juicy.
Juicy.
- Good call.
Good call.
- Yep, yep, yep.
Tight, tight, tight, tight, tight.
Well, looks like round one goes to Peralta.
And don't worry; I'm just getting warmed up.
I still have eight sunglass moves locked and loaded.
Make that nine.
A-whee.
So how was lunch?
It was good.
I had the T-bone with I don't give a crap about the food.
Just email me about that later.
What happened with Gary?
He gave me the hard sell.
Look at all this swag I got: Puffy vest, carabiner Terry, carabiners suck.
You want free stuff?
Here you go.
All right?
You can have anything you want from Amy's desk.
Yeah.
Gary made me an offer: Better hours, great benefits, a serious pay raise, my own office with walls.
Did you tell him Terry doesn't love walls?
No, Terry loves walls.
I'm seriously considering saying yes Look, I have another kid on the way.
Do you know how much diapers cost?
Yes.
The point is, I'm trying to do what's best for my family.
- It's not just about me.
- Exactly.
It's about me and how you are abandoning me to these squares.
Yikes.
Look at all these baby masks.
Looks like someone's due for a spanking from Papa Law.
Nice.
So the van was stolen from a rental lot three weeks ago and dumped here yesterday.
Talk about a curbside drop-off.
We're working a case here, Amy.
It's not Showtime at the Apollo.
Great point.
Thank you so much, Jake.
Well, I'm going to go sign the van over to forensics.
Hey, listen, I'm a member of this invite-only speakeasy called The Keychain.
Want to get a drink there later?
I'd ask Amy also, but I can only bring one guest.
Nah, it's cool; I'm sure she's busy tonight anyway.
Taxes are due in eight months.
Actually, they were due two weeks ago.
Well, that is a horrible surprise.
But the point is, drink sounds good.
Password?
Tropical.
Oh, my gah.
This place is amazing.
Yeah, I come here after ever case I solve, which means I'm here a lot.
Oh, nice.
Every time I solve one, I go get a steak dinner.
My cholesterol is uh-terrible.
Milo, this is my friend Jake.
We're working a case together.
Yeah, and this is my friend Dave.
We're friends.
I'll have a Oh no.
You don't order here.
Milo makes you a drink he knows you'll love, and then you love it.
Really?
Interesting.
Barrel Proof bourbon, neat orange stood a chaser.
Well, to the first of many hangs.
Yeah, totally.
Listen, the reason I brought you here is, I want to ask you, what's the deal with Santiago?
Amy?
Oh, no.
Did she do something weird?
No, no, she's great.
I just want to know if there's something going on with you two.
You know, are you together Oh, no, no.
Cool, when this case is over, I'm gonna ask her out.
Oh.
You're gonna ask out Amy when the case ends.
Perfect.
Oh.
Yeah, that's a sippin' whiskey.
So it is.
Seems about right.
What's wrong with you?
You and Majors have too much fun last night at "The Keychain"?
Okay, it's a private bar, not a haunted motel.
And no, I did not have a good time.
Turns out he didn't want to be best bros at all.
He just wanted to know if I was cool with him asking Amy out when the case ended.
I thought he was dating that weather girl.
No, he dumped her because she blamed Hurricane Sandy on gay marriage.
Anyways, now when the case ends, Amy is gonna marry Detective "Blotter Dynamite".
Why do you even care?
You still like her?
I don't know.
I mean, we're friends.
And things have been kind of flirty lately.
Plus, we had this weird romantic moment thing-y at Charles and Gina's parents' wedding.
Ugh, just say you still like her.
All right, fine, I still like her.
Look, I've been thinking about asking her out for the last couple of weeks, but it's hard.
There's so much buildup now, you know?
Not really.
I don't ask people out.
I just tell them where we're going.
Great, well, it doesn't matter now anyway, 'cause I told Dave to go for it.
That was crazy stupid.
Sorry.
That was normal stupid.
You should have told him to back off.
I can't go around telling guys not to ask Amy out because I like her and I'm too dumb to do anything about it.
I can't make a woman's choice for her.
I stand with Wendy.
Did I do that right?
- No.
- Oh.
Look, If you want to give her a real choice, you've got to let her know that you are an option.
I think you know what you've got to do.
Yeah.
Ask her out before the case ends, right?
I just want to be extra clear.
The stakes are through the roof for me on this one.
You wanted to see us?
What are these requisition forms?
We are throwing Terry a "please stay" party.
My vision is a frozen yogurt machine operated by Pam Grier.
Sir, we think Sarge is going to accept Copperhead's offer.
I never thought I'd say these words: You have to put Gina in touch with Pam Grier.
No, Sergeant Jeffords can make up his mind without the influence of Foxy Brown or cold yogurt.
He is a grown man.
Oh, I see what's going on here You're upset that Terry would even consider leaving the Nine-Nine.
I'd expect this pettiness from a spineless amoeba like Charles, but not you, Sir.
I'm not spineless.
Come on, Charles.
Yep.
Ahh, look who's finally here.
We already solved the case without you.
What?
You did?
Kidding.
Oliver was actually giving us some pretty bad news.
Carry on, Oliver.
So we swabbed the whole van.
We didn't find anything.
No hairs, no fibers, no semen.
And a rental van is usually a frickin' Jackson Pollock.
All right.
They also wiped down the masks with some sort of bleach solution.
They were really covering their tracks.
Check it out.
Well, that wasn't very helpful.
Although, I did learn I should never rent a van again.
Hey, can I talk to you for a second privately?
Sure.
Oh, wait.
This isn't gonna be that thing where you pretend you got an important text from Holt, and it's just that video of screaming sheep.
I promise you it's not, but I do stand by that prank.
So what's up?
Okay, I almost feel weird saying this, but I wanted to ask you wow, those pictures are not helping.
Oh, my God.
They're really gonna have to re-grout.
Ugh, finding a contractor.
You are so consistent.
Anyways, the question I wanted to ask you is So I got the results on that feces.
It's human, but it's not all human.
You're not Dr. Gassner.
We are not.
- Can you give us a sec?
- Sure.
Real quick, what was the other Dog and bear.
Wow.
I thought you'd really be into that feces puzzle.
Normally, yes.
But I want to talk to you about something else right now.
More specifically - Guys, dispatch just called.
- Great, Dave's here now.
The check-cashing babies just struck on Flatbush.
We've got to go.
Lead the way.
What did you want to tell me?
Oh, Captain Holt sent a very important text.
Oh.
What's that smell?
That's lavender.
Terry loves lavender.
A little homemade honey yogurt infused with lavender and love.
Mmm, that is delicious.
Hold it.
This isn't some weird breast milk or something is it, Boyle?
I mean, technically it's from a sheep's breast.
Hey, Terry, got any new baby pics?
You hate looking at pictures of my twins.
You said since they were identical, I didn't need to take photos of both.
That doesn't sound like Auntie Gina.
I love your baby pics and your stories about the twins' sleep schedules.
Okay, I know what you two are doing.
This is your weird way of trying to make me stay at the Nine-Nine.
Well, I am loving it.
You know, the funny thing is, Cagney naps better, but at night, that's Lacey's time to shine.
One time, she went 8-to-8.
- Dang.
- Wow.
I know.
Jeffords, I need you to digitize all your case files from 1995 to 1999 inclusive by tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. But it's already 1:00.
I told Sharon we'd have dinner tonight.
I was gonna have a cup of coffee so that I could stay up and kiss.
I suggest putting that caffeine towards something more productive than "kissing".
Sir, what are you doing?
Making sure Jeffords' case files are digitized by tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. I thought I was perfectly clear.
I've got to call my wife, tell her date night is off.
I sent her all those kiss-face emojis for no damn reason.
Oh, no.
Despite what I've been saying for years, that ass just might quit.
I don't get it.
There's no rhyme or reason to the locations they hit.
This place was so well-guarded.
And why not hit the one down the street that just has an old man out front?
It just seems so random.
Yeah, it's like oh, that feels great.
I don't think it's random.
These guys are too good, you know.
We'll crack it.
I'm gonna go grab some coffee.
Great.
Mm.
Hey, now that it's just us, there's a thing I wanted to to say a-da-za you.
Why doesn't your mouth work?
Why doesn't your mouth work?
Title of our sex tape.
- What?
- Your sex tape.
What?
No.
Look, here's what I wanted to say.
Oh, no.
I just figured it out.
- Huh?
- Here, look.
The trash cans, the van, the jumpsuit, they all say "Johnny's Janitorial".
Not random.
They cased each location as cleaners.
That's why the van was so spotless.
Hey, what did I miss?
Jake just solved the case.
Holy crap.
That's awesome.
All right.
I mean, but, you know, it's not totally done yet.
You know, still a long way to go.
Tons of paperwork, and a case is never truly done until the trial is complete and the sentence is served completely to its fruition in prison.
Jake, just celebrate.
Okay.
Wow.
Why the long face?
That Mexican candy giving you nerve damage again?
Probably, but who even cares?
Why'd I have to solve the case?
Why couldn't I have just let those guys continue to terrorize Brooklyn until I built up the nerve to ask out a girl?
You're a good cop.
Do not beat yourself up about that.
I'm not a good cop.
I'm an amazing cop.
And I'll never forgive myself.
The case is over, Amy and Majors are on their way to The Keychain right now.
It's too late.
Has she done the double tuck yet?
When Amy really likes a guy, she gets nervous and tucks her hair behind both ears at the same time.
Well, I can never unsee that, but no, she has not done that yet.
Then there's still time.
Get in there and bust up her date.
Show her you care.
Ruin her night.
You really have a unique take on love.
Ugh, I've only gotten through September of 1995.
What are you guys doing here?
Blowing your stupid mind.
We did the rest of the files for you.
Seriously?
I'm gonna text my wife.
Now there's time for dinner and a movie.
And none of that "on demand" crap.
Tonight I'm gonna fall asleep in a real movie theater.
Yeah, that's how we do it in the Nine-Nine.
We've got each others' backs.
Damn right.
Charles, make your own point.
Don't just pile onto mine.
Gina, where have you been?
You left your cell phone on your desk, and I assumed you were dead.
Mm, I would clearly be buried with my phone.
Sir, these guys already digitized all my files for me.
- Isn't that amazing?
- What?
Why did you snatch up Sergeant Jeffords' task?
Because we're trying to get him to stay.
Well, that's not your job.
And Jeffords, you can stay here and digitize I expect it done by the morning.
Great.
Now I have to re-cancel on Sharon.
If I worked at Copperhead, I'd be home by now swimming in a pool of gold coins, like my boy, Scrooge McDuck.
Password?
- Tropical.
- Mm-mm.
That's an old password.
It changes every night.
All right, fine.
Tropical one?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Augh!
Ahh!
Ha-ha.
Not cool, okay?
Look, just ask Milo the bartender, all right?
He knows me.
Tell him Orange Soda is back.
I don't know no Milo.
The bartenders also change their names every night.
And get out of here until you know the password, man.
Damn it.
This place is so cool.
Come on, strangers.
Show me your lips.
There you go.
Got it.
Pepper.
Pooper.
Popcorn.
Plor-pa-pa.
Plorp.
Pa-aark.
Parked.
Okay.
Yeah.
Nooorse.
Bull's-eye.
Oh, no, the double tuck.
Oh, hey.
You wouldn't kick out a hopeless romantic who's only here in the name of love, would you?
Ooh, you would.
Terry!
So what happened at breakfast with Gary?
Are you leaving us for Copperhead?
Because I'm prepared to light Charles on fire in protest.
Relax.
I declined the offer, told them I wasn't interested.
Eat it, Gary.
I gave him back all his swag, except the puffy vest, which I, uh, lost.
I'm staying at the Nine-Nine!
Great news, Sergeant.
Really?
So you're done trying to push him out, Yoko?
Whoa, don't give Captain Holt a hard time.
He's the reason I'm staying.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You're an adult, and you came to your own decision.
Look at me.
I can't keep a straight face.
I played you like a fiddle.
Yeah, you did.
Digitizing those old files reminded me of all the cases I worked and all the good we do in a community.
What's best for my family is that they grow up with a dad who's proud of what he does.
Thank you, Captain.
Look at you.
You're like the wise old owl from those lollipop commercials.
Terry's back!
Hey, buddy, sorry I'm late.
I had to get this dumb medal from the commissioner for a double-murder I solved last year.
Been there.
I had a pretty crazy morning myself.
Jake, your taquitos exploded in the toaster oven.
Thanks, Rosa.
So how did it go with Santiago?
Actually, she wasn't into it.
Swing and a miss.
You're kidding.
Yeah, it was really weird.
I've never been turned down before, so unexpected.
I'm excited to see what happens to me next.
Okay.
So Blotter Dynamite struck out, huh?
I know, but why?
What does it mean, and why did she double tuck?
And how come she turned him down?
Do you think it has something to do with me?
- Rosa, what is she thinking?
- Jake.
Yeah, I should ask her myself.
Hey, you just missed Majors.
I've got to say, he was looking a little bit rough, almost like he was up all night crying or something.
Ha-ha, Jake.
I'm sure he's fine.
So what happened?
Well, I thought we were getting a drink to celebrate closing the case.
But apparently, he thought it was a date.
Right, and you were not into that, because he's so muscular and in command of his finances?
He's great, but after everything that happened with Teddy and all the cops I know who go out and break up and then still have to work together, it's just too messy.
I don't date cops.
Cool.
Cool.
Yeah, actually, that's funny.
I have the same rule.
No more cops.
From this point on, it's strictly dating criminals.
If you break up with them, you can always send them to jail forever.
Exactly, nice and clean.
- Mm-hmm.
- So Hey, I got an email from the commissioner's office about our case.
What did they say?
Ahh!
Ahh.
Ah-ha.
You got me with my thing.
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.
Oh!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hey, Gina, you got that file I needed Captain Holt to sign?
Uh-huh.
Mm.
Gina hasn't taken her eyes off her phone in two hours.
First person to make her look up wins the pot.
I'm in.
A bet which improves someone's manners?
Double score.
Sorry, guys.
I got this in the bag.
I used to have to distract her from her phone all the time when we were smooshin' booties.
- Ugh.
- Yeah.
Hey, girl Catch you later.
Mid-morning dance party.
She's dancing even better than normal.
Oh, my God, did you hear that George W. Bush died?
Who dat?
Ooh.
Gina may never look at another real human being again.
She's unbeatable.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Terrence Jeffords, are you kidding me?
Changed my relationship status to "it's complicated".
Pony up, y'all!
Whoo!
It's my wife.
Hey, baby.
No!
No, no, no.
It was a mistake.
My thumb slipped and I have to go home.
Ladies and gentlemen, today is the greatest day of my life.
Guess who just got murdered!
That's right it's Carl Mather.
What?
I'm the only one gasping?
Guys, Carl Mather?
Did 25 years in Attica Sor sorry.
Just point at me when you want me to gasp.
Will do.
Mather is part of the Fulton Street Four.
Oh!
They stole $21 million from an armored car depot.
Feds caught them but they never found the money.
- Until now.
- You found $21 million?
Oh, God no.
Not yet.
I can see how that would be confusing though.
I'm sorry.
But I'm going to.
Over the past six months, all four of these guys have been released, and now one of them shows up dead.
Someone's after that money, and they're willing to kill for it.
You're getting ahead of yourself.
You don't know that Mather's death is connected to the money yet.
Don't turn this into something bigger than it is, not with Madeline Wuntch watching us at all times.
Ew.
When'd they put that in?
Right after Wuntch got promoted.
She had it installed at that height so she'd, I quote, "always be looking down at me," unquote.
Treat this like a regular case.
Sir, with all due respect, this is an epic case.
It's the reason I became a cop.
I mean, hunting down a murderer, recovering millions in stolen money, rappelling out of a chopper with a knife between my teeth.
Why would you jump out of a helicopter with a knife in your mouth?
It's called a chopper, and the knife is in my mouth because both of my hands are holding giant machine guns.
And that's how it's going down.
Okay, reminder, tomorrow we are hosting a field trip for the Brooklyn Park Magnet School.
Sorry, Sarge, I can't be around magnets.
Pacemaker.
I'm actually not gonna correct you on that.
Guys, I really need this to go well.
My girls are on the wait list for their preschool and it's twice as tough to get in with twins.
Why don't you just get one of them in and then let them take turns going to school every other day?
Diaz, that's crazy.
I asked my wife and she said no.
This field trip has to go well.
This is my chance to impress the principal.
Sarge, you're in luck.
I went to a magnet school where I was voted "most likely to befriend a school administrator".
Oh, Amy.
Preteens are my people.
I speak their language.
They are gonna have an amazing time.
Thanks, guys.
That's great.
If you want, I can show them some of the cool stuff we have in the evidence locker.
I'm pretty sure there's a bag of hands in there.
Whoa!
No.
No.
We got to make this place kid-friendly.
No crime scene photos lying about.
That's not a crime scene.
That's a boudoir photo I'm having framed for my wife.
That's me underneath the mask.
Oh, God!
Next, let's get statements from the neighbors.
Ah, hello, Captain.
Quick update: Another one of the Fulton Street Four was murdered here this morning.
Huh, I'm surprised you're not celebrating inappropriately.
This is a crime scene and I'm a professional.
You did it before I showed up?
Yeah, that is exactly correct.
So two of these guys murdered in the past two days?
It has to be tied to the missing money.
Admit I was right.
Circumstances do suggest a connection.
Admit it with more gusto.
- You were right.
- Yes!
Did you get it, Boyle?
Oh, the camera was in selfie mode, but I look super proud of you.
Unfortunately, because this case has turned out to be important, that she-skunk Madeline Wuntch has her hindquarters pointed right at it.
She wants to see us in her office, no doubt to give the case to Major Crimes.
No, no, no.
We can't let that happen.
Sir, we have to do something.
Fine.
I'll seduce her.
I'll just put on my bike shorts and give her a glimpse of the quad cities.
No.
No.
That's not what I meant.
I meant we have to fight her.
We're not gonna fight her.
She's the devil.
And you don't dance with the devil, because you get burned.
Also, because in Madeline's case, she has no rhythm and her hands are like little rat claws.
If she wants the case, it's hers.
For the record, you're turning this murder scene into a real bummer-scape.
Tell me you got that zinger.
Oh, the camera was in selfie mode again, but I was really laughing hard.
Okay.
Okay, kids, this is where my detective squad solves crimes.
- Wow.
- This is my desk.
You can tell by the framed my three-year-olds put together on their own.
That's very advanced, Sergeant Jeffords.
Is it?
I wouldn't know what milestones are impressive to a school admissions officer.
They can count to 20 in English and Mandarin.
Hi.
Detective Santiago, magnet school alumna.
Well, I appreciate that you used the proper declension of alumnus.
Well, some say Latin is a dead language, but I say it's just taking a long nap.
Okay, you two are obviously the alphas.
Let me guess.
You're dating the blond kid and you like Filipino Bieber but you're worried he's still into Little Miss Side Braid Janky Purse.
How did you know?
I know so much.
Hi, I'm Gina.
Hey.
Hello, Raymond.
How do you like my new office?
20th floor.
Yes, I never thought I'd see you this high without a broom under you.
Enough niceties.
Have a seat.
Thanks, but I'm actually fine standing.
I could stay in these bad boys all day.
So two members of the Fulton Street Four have been murdered sounds like a big case.
No, it's actually the opposite.
Pretty much an NBT sitch.
No big thang.
The word is "thing," and the thing is big.
We believe someone is after the missing $21 million, and solving this murder could lead us to the money.
Sure, but that money's, like, 25 years old.
It's probably not even good anymore.
Sorry.
Cramped up.
This is a very important case, Raymond, to me, and to the city of New York.
I'm not sure the Nine-Nine has the resources to deal with something of this magnitude.
I understand the politics.
This is a high-profile case.
Do what you must.
What I was going to say is, since you don't have the resources, I'll give you anything you need.
The case is yours.
You have my full support.
What?
He meant that more excited.
Like, "What"!
Okay, two of the Fulton Street Four are dead.
My hunch one of them is killing off his co-scums so he can keep the money for his scum-self.
We'll start with Reggie Bludsoe.
He listed a Brooklyn address with his parole officer.
We're gonna nail this son of a bitch.
Unless he's innocent then we're gonna save the son of a bitch.
Either way, this case is gonna be awesome.
Peralta, I'm putting myself on this investigation with you.
- What?
Why?
- Wuntch is up to something.
There's only one reason why she would let us keep this case.
She took one look at me and said, "That's the guy I want flying my chopper".
You know how to fly a chopper?
How hard could it be?
It's just a big fan that goes in the sky.
She let us keep this case because she wants us to fail.
I'm coming along so that you don't waste time and resources turning this investigation into another Ron McClane movie.
Oh, you know it's John McClane.
I've made my decision.
End of discussion.
All right, fine.
But you're gonna have to take your own car.
I signed out that drug dealer's Lamborghini from the impound.
It only has two seats.
I saw that you had made that request.
I changed it to a sensible sedan.
Okay, but the sunroof stays open.
There is no sunroof.
Why did you even become a cop?
Oh, great job, kids.
Don't solve too many crimes and put me out of business.
Terry's got to pay the rent.
Dr. Susman wants a private chat with me.
Thanks for warming her up, Santiago.
They didn't give eighth grade Amy the key to the teacher's lounge just for nothing.
I stocked their fridge and cleaned up after them.
Great.
So can you take over with the kids for a minute?
They're done with this activity.
Of course.
I am amazing with kids.
Okay.
I am terrible with kids.
I haven't listened to rap music in three years.
I don't know the lingo.
You have to do this.
I can't McKenzie is in the bathroom right now freaking out because Kelsey S. Made out with Hayes even though she knows Brianna's into him.
So unless you want the spring dance to be a total drama fest, I have to be there for her.
Honestly, you should show them a picture of a dead body.
No!
Rosa, Terry said to keep it kid-friendly.
Okay, I'll just show them the stuff that I was into when I was their age.
- I'm done.
- What do we do now?
- What's next?
- Hello, friends.
Who here would like to see a presentation about crime statistics as a function of demographics and time?
Who wants to see a picture of a dead body?
Me!
Bludsoe lives at the end of his hall.
Hmm I would have preferred an abandoned lighthouse or a dilapidated barn, but I can embellish in my memoirs.
Oh, I can't wait to read that book.
What are you gonna call it?
"Go Ahead, Jake My Day".
No, yours is much better.
"Case Closed, Jake Open".
- Wow.
- I know.
I said yours was better.
Whatever.
Let's just do this.
NYPD.
Open up.
Hey, check it out.
Half-packed suitcase.
Looks like Bludsoe was planning a trip until he got interrupted by someone.
- Or something.
- Like what?
I don't know I just thought it would help the intrigue.
It did.
That's enough chitchat already.
Come on, how many people have to get killed before you start having fun?
You do know it's our job to stop the killing, right?
Wait a second.
I think I smell a dead body.
Nope.
My mistake.
Wait!
Don't close that.
Look.
Handprint.
That's a fake wall.
NYPD.
Come out with your hands on your head.
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.
He's trying to kill me.
So I guess, if I had to sum them up, Cagney is the intellectual one, whereas Lacey is more of your traditional prodigy.
Well, your daughters sound great.
You know, I'm gonna look over their applications again.
Oh, no, that's not necessary.
It's Jeffords with two Fs.
But what really matters is that your students have an amazing experience here today.
They are.
Look, Rosa.
Sarge is here.
Oh, my God.
Children, get out of this room immediately.
Let's go.
What the hell, guys?
They're 12 years old.
I would've killed to have seen a bag of hands at that age.
I'm so sorry I tired to be myself and they hated it.
- Where were you?
- Saving the day.
Hayes is out of the picture.
The McKenzie/Kelsey S. beef is squashed, and Brianna's going to the dance with Aidan, who's a much better match for her anyway, BT-dubs.
How does any of that help me?
- Dr. Susman - Good-bye, Sergeant Jeffords.
I think this experience has been more than enough for the children.
We're done here.
I was walking home from the coffee shop.
I have a job bussing tables there.
Anyway, the next thing I know, Mikey D has a gun in my back.
Michael D'Angelo, the other member of the Fulton Street Four.
Yes, believe it or not, I familiarized myself with the names of all two suspects in this high-profile homicide we're investigating.
I fought him off, but he got my key.
What's the key for?
Each of us had one, and you needed all four to open the safe.
And what's in the safe?
The $21 million.
Bing pot Nope I was gonna say bingo, but then I was like, "Jackpot's better," but then it was too late; I was halfway through the word.
Bingpot works.
It's taking off.
It's taking off.
Captain, D'Angelo has a place upstate.
The local sheriff says there's a car in the driveway right now.
He must be there.
Okay, they're gonna have to raid the place without us.
It'll take us two hours to get up there.
Or we could take We are not taking a helicopter.
You know I was gonna say chopper.
Look, Peralta, I know you're having fun, but a helicopter is exactly the kind of wasteful expenditure that Wuntch will use to bury me if something goes wrong.
- Okay, sir - Or It's the kind of thing she'll crucify me for not getting.
"You could've had a chopper, Raymond.
"Why didn't you take advantage?
Just a minute my cauldron's boiling over".
Yeah, but what she actually said was, "Chopper's yours, Peralta".
Your impression was better.
What did you do?
She may have called me and I may have briefed her and she may have said yes to the chopper because it's definitely on its way right now!
I call middle seat!
Whoo!
This is awesome!
Okay, just so we're clear, from this point forward, my call sign will be Death Blade.
And I'll be Rum Tum Tugger.
No, Boyle.
No characters from Cats.
Dig deep.
Think of something scary.
Adolf Hitler.
No!
You will be Sidewinder.
All right, but I'm more scared of Hitler.
How about you, Captain?
What's your call sign?
I will be Captain Raymond Holt.
Uh-huh, I knew you wouldn't play ball.
And that is why your call sign is Wet Blanket.
Sidewinder, this is Death Blade.
Do you copy, Sidewinder?
Over.
This is Sidewinder, Death Blade.
I read you loud and clear.
Over.
Do you have a 20 on Wet Blanket, Sidewinder?
Over.
- I do have a visual - Over.
All right, look, Captain, Wuntch said that we could have anything we needed to solve this case.
Yes, but why?
To catch a murderer who stole $21 million.
No, it's so that when we do fail, it'll be that much more spectacular.
If we don't get D'Angelo, my career is over.
But if we do catch him, your career will really take off.
Chopper pun!
Dr. Susman, I am so, so sorry.
Please don't hold this against my daughters.
I would never do that.
Preschool admissions are based on what we think of the parents.
Oh, no.
Dr. Susman Nancy, if I may - You may not.
- Okay.
Look, our methods may have been a little unorthodox, and perhaps a little Graphic and disgusting.
I was gonna go with yucky But these kids had fun today.
And they learned a lot.
Tricia, what's Luminol?
It's used to look for blood in a crime scene.
Even if a criminal tried to clean it up, the iron in blood makes the chemical glow.
And, Bobby, what's enucleation?
It's when someone pops your eyeball out.
Probably should've used a less gross example.
The point is, this is exactly the kind of educational experience I loved about my magnet school.
Well, there's something to be said for that.
Also, and more importantly, I got McKenzie and Brianna to stop hating on Kelsey S. And now they're best friends you're welcome.
Wow, that's actually impressive.
Thank you.
So, Dr. Susman, let's just call this field trip what it was a huge success.
It was interesting.
I saw a prostitute.
Not helping, kid.
I'm Death Blade.
D'Angelo's place is just beyond those trees.
No one's gone in our out.
Good thing we got here in time.
Flew in on a chopper.
Bell 412 or the A119 Koala?
It's classified.
Actually, it was the 350B2.
Nice.
No, don't give him the "nice".
We haven't seen any movement in the house, but there are lights on in the barn.
There's a barn?
What is your fascination with barns?
It's where all the awesome stand-offs happen rusty farm equipment, light shining through bullet holes.
I'll bet you at least one dove takes flight in slo-mo.
I will take that bet, because that's impossible.
We've got a team on the back entrance, a team watching the house, and a marksman on that hill.
Okay, tell your men if they find the money first, that I get to riffle it next to my ear and go, "It's all here".
- Already told them, Jake.
- Love you, bud.
All right, let's lock and load.
Dope.
Moved faster than I was expecting, but still cool.
I don't see him.
Oh, he's here.
I can feel it.
He is.
He's dead.
- What?
- The body is right here.
Damn it!
Bludsoe played us.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Peralta.
Is Bludsoe still in custody?
Yeah, we got him.
He's in his Ooh.
So good news first.
We're gonna be flying back past a beautiful sunset.
Bad news Bludsoe escaped from the hospital and we're all screwed.
But Pretty sunset.
Oh, man, look at the captain.
He's pacing slowly.
For him, that's like a full-on, rage-fueled freak out.
The only thing worse is when he stands perfectly still.
Oh, no, he's standing perfectly still.
All right, I'm gonna go talk to him.
Mm, no I'm not.
Yep, I am.
No, I'm not gonna do it.
Okay, I am.
I'm gonna go.
Okay.
Be careful.
- You're so brave.
- Thanks.
Hey, Captain.
What you thinking about?
Mostly about how Madeline Wuntch will destroy me because you wanted a helicopter to play action movie.
I needed the helicopter because I was chasing a bad guy because I'm a cop.
Really?
It wasn't just to make this case epic?
This case is epic.
You're just too wrapped up in the politics to see it.
Sir, we're tracking a triple murderer who stole $21 million, and all you can think about is Madeline Wuntch.
- You're right.
- What's that now?
Before I came to the Nine-Nine, I was rotting away behind a desk in the public relations department.
All I wanted was the chance to do good police work again.
I just got it, and I blew it thinking about that devil toad.
I'm tired of politics.
Let's get that punk!
Bludsoe.
This is amazing.
Of course, we have no idea where he is, but I love where your head's at.
He has no family.
Maybe there was a girlfriend or someone he worked with at the coffee shop.
The coffee shop why would someone who knows they have $21 million coming take a minimum wage job?
Because he needed access to that building.
Because that's where the money's hidden.
All right, we got to get there quick.
Maybe we should take the chopper.
You said chopper.
Death Blade, Sidewinder, it's go time!
Roger that, Wet Blanket.
No, from now on, call me Velvet Thunder.
Okay.
Hey, Cagney and Lacey got off the wait list.
Thank you, guys, for helping me.
Rosa, I should've listened to you.
Yeah, everyone should listen to me all the time about everything.
It was pretty fun.
The kids actually liked me.
I wish I could go back to middle school knowing what I know now.
I'd be so cool.
And I'd get to retake all the tests.
And update some book reports.
Oh, un, Gina, Dr. Susman said you had a real impact on those kids.
Apparently, you were just named Spring Dance Princess somehow.
Mm-hmm, what am I always telling you guys?
I'm royalty.
All right, listen up.
We go in strong and we go in fast.
Evans, you're on door breach.
Patterson flashbang.
Boyle, stop squatting like that.
Sorry, I thought it looked cool.
- It didn't.
- On the count of three.
It's Bludsoe!
- NYPD!
- Go, go, go!
Facedown, flat on the ground!
Hey, over here, over here.
Bingpot!
This rules.
Did you know that my dream has always been to have my picture taken with a mountain of recovered cash?
And it's always been my dream to take that picture of you, Jake.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Yeah!
$21 million, Raymond.
I have to admit, I'm impressed.
Sorry to disappoint you, Madeline.
I know you'd hoped we'd fail.
Oh, no, I couldn't be happier.
Wait Why would you say that?
And why aren't you clenching your little rat hands in anger?
You didn't want me to fail.
You wanted me to succeed.
That's right.
I was looking for an excuse to promote you to a desk job, and you handed it to me on a silver platter with your little rat hands.
Oh, no.
Say good-bye to the Nine-Nine, Raymond.
I'm making you head of NYPD Public Relations.
Captain, get in here with me.
Go ahead.
Smile for the cameras, Raymond.
That's your new job now.
Hey!
Okay, quick, let's pose back-to-back with our arms crossed and a cocky smirk.
You doing it?
Your arms crossed?
No, arms down.
That's good.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
No!
No, no, no!
You can't take her from me, you bastard!
Don't do this, Scully.
You have to be strong for her right now.
What's going on?
Unit's being replaced.
Come on!
No!
That machine's been here forever.
It's basically part of the force.
Take Scully instead.
Yes, please, take me to the land of vending machines.
Can we at least have five minutes to say a proper good-bye?
Whatever.
Let me just start by saying that this machine is the best restaurant in Brooklyn, and it always had a table for me.
I knew just where to punch it to get free food.
Now I have to go back to punching Hitchcock.
Look, she still has the bags of baby carrots I requested they put in.
They're black now, but they're there.
Good-bye, beautiful machine.
Thank you for your service.
Okay, squad salute.
You can take her away now.
Well, I think we handled that with dignity.
Free candy!
Okay, Nine-Nine, say hello to Michael Augustine, Brooklyn's most prolific identity thief.
Last week, he walked into a government building and stole a computer containing over 100,000 social security numbers.
My C.I. says that tonight Augustine will be handing off the laptop to a buyer from China, AKA the Land of Dragons.
Make sure that phrase is not in your official report.
Okay, sorry, The Country of Dragons.
I want you and Santiago to tail Augustine until he makes the drop, and then arrest him and the buyer.
Sounds good, although I could probably just take Boyle.
I know Amy has a ton of work, so - No, I don't.
- Really?
I could have sworn I overheard you telling Rosa, "Girlfriend, please.
I got hella open cases".
That's something you think I'd say?
Word for word.
No diggity, no doubt.
That's enough.
Peralta and Santiago will tail Augustine.
Boyle and Diaz will join them in a surveillance van unless you have a problem with that.
Sounds great.
In the immortal words of Amy Santiago, "Girlfriend, please".
Hey, did I do something to you?
Are you mad?
Is this because I brushed all the crumbs off your desk?
What?
No, I don't care about that.
- Do you know where they are?
- In the trash.
All right, if it's not that, then why are you trying to keep me off this case?
Oh, that.
All right, look, the reason that I didn't want to work with you is should I do this in an accent so that I can undercut some of the awkwardness I'm feeling?
- No.
- Good call.
Remember when you told me that you didn't want to date cops?
That really bummed me out, man.
- Jamaican?
- Yeah, it was a bad choice.
I'm much better at German.
All right, fine.
I was kind of thinking about asking you out.
Oh, okay.
But I know that that's not what you want, and I totally get it.
I think it just took me a while to totally-totally get it, and now I totally get it.
Jake, this is weird.
The whole point of me not dating cops is so it wouldn't be weird at work.
Okay, so let's just make it not weird, right?
This is a case; we work cases together all the time, and we're really good at it, so, you know, we're professionals.
That's all I want, for us to be professional.
We're in agreement.
It will be good and professional.
Come in and shut the door.
I have some news, which you must promise to keep secret.
Madeline Wuntch is making me head of public relations for the NYPD.
I'm being forced out of the Nine-Nine.
I don't wish to make a big deal of it, so please limit your reactions to one second; go.
- What in the world?
- Are you kidding?
That's plenty.
You can't leave us.
I'm not going anywhere.
Madeline's not some invincible succubus.
She's a regular succubus, and she can be defeated.
We just need to find the letter.
What letter?
Before our current police commissioner was hired, a mutual friend told me Madeline wrote a letter to the mayor telling him it was a mistake.
She apparently called her now-boss a "simpering buffoon".
Amateur; always say your insults to someone's face.
No paper trail.
A copy of that letter exists in the mayor's archives.
I can't go snooping around without alerting Madeline, so it won't be easy, and we don't have much time, but I need you to find that letter.
Are you with me?
Oh, hell yeah.
I'm turning my phone into airplane mode.
Oh, my God, she doesn't even do that on airplanes.
Rosa, I know you don't like anyone wishing you a happy birthday, so crappy day to you.
Still too much.
I assume you're not doing anything to celebrate tonight.
Anyone over the age of six celebrating a birthday should go to hell.
So since you're free, I need your help moving this old Ms. Pac-Man machine I just bought.
Why are you so obsessed with that game?
Because it's the sexiest video game ever.
She's insatiable, Rosa.
Insatiable.
Insatiab Stop saying "insatiable".
Anyway, I bought this old machine from a bar, and I was hoping you'd help me move it.
- You want me to go to a bar?
- Mm-hmm.
You are obviously trying to get me to go to a surprise party.
Did Marcus put you up to this?
What?
No, that's crazy talking.
We just need to be there at exactly 9:45 p.m. and not a minute earlier.
Also, there's a particular door I want us to enter through.
Why is he getting out here?
I thought your C.I. said the drop was happening in a park.
Maybe he's having dinner with his sidepiece first.
Augustine has the laptop with him.
We should just arrest him right here.
No, the buyer's the bigger collar.
We've got to follow him in and wait for the handoff.
Okay, if you're going in, I've heard this place has an amazing bone marrow custard.
Not that I've ever had a bad one.
No.
All right, let's go.
No, wait, we look like cops.
We're never gonna blend in dressed like this.
Okay, there, how's that?
Uh, I don't know.
All I see is clothes hanging off of a genderless blob.
You look fine.
Here, wear this.
Jake, you need a jacket or something.
Well, Scully left his sports coat back there.
Oh, but it will never fit Jake's athletic body.
- Unless - No, I don't want to do that.
- You have to.
- I'm not gonna do it.
You're doing it.
What?
What do you have to do?
Don Johnson it.
Don Johnson it!
I look like an idiot.
I didn't even have time to lotion my forearms.
It's so weird wearing Rosa's jacket.
There's a piece of barbed wire in the pocket.
Cool.
All right, do you have a visual on the hostess stand?
Hi.
Table for two, please.
I'm so sorry.
There's nothing available.
We're totally booked up.
Oh, no, that's horrible.
Tonight's a really important night for us.
Johnny and I just got engaged, and this is where our first date was.
Oh, yeah, it would mean so much to Dora and me.
I would have made a reservation, but I didn't know if she was gonna say yes, so Oh, I love how nervous you were, you little goose.
You are just so sweet together.
You know, I'm sure I can find room for two young lovers.
Yeah, we are lovers together in beds.
Okay.
Thank you so much for waiting.
- Your table is almost ready.
- Great.
Sorry about springing the engagement and romantic stuff on you.
No, no, no.
That was great.
I mean, it's what got us in here.
Cheek kiss was a bit much.
Very wet.
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
Dora's sloppy.
Okay, and if you'll just follow me.
Well, the honeymoon's over, Dora.
We're back to being Jake and Amy, two normal cops working a job.
All right, there you go.
Thanks.
You're the couple that just got engaged.
That's us, Johnny and Dora, a couple for sure.
Okay, according to my sources in the assistant community, the letter is right here in the fourth-floor archives, cabinet J-13.
Nice job.
What's the plan?
You sneak in and get the letter.
I'll distract the file clerk.
Apparently, he's very into bird watching, so talking to a woman should blow his mind.
And talking to this woman, it could kill him.
Here, can you look at this map of a park and tell me where them hot birds hang out?
Well, you're gonna want to, uh, avoid the, uh, great lawn, because it's basically just grackles.
- Ugh, grackles?
- Yeah.
I hate grackles.
They're the worst.
Well, a lot of people think grackles are just a common bird up here, but you know what?
On the West Coast they don't get grackles.
Can you give some more info for a novice bird watcher such as myself?
You have got to know the difference between your water birds.
I mean, so many people don't know the difference between an anhinga and a snake bird and a swamp hawk.
A lot of people don't know they're all the same bird.
Are those the ones that sound like Rihanna kind of when they sing?
I'm not familiar with who that is.
They're like, "Eh, eh".
That sounds like that might be a crested woodpecker.
Or is it more like Well, that's a crested titmouse maybe?
Oh, my God, that's it.
Wayne, you are a damn treasure trove.
We got the letter.
Well done.
Now get me Madeline and a bucket of water.
It's time to melt a witch.
Who else is going?
Rosa, listen to me, there is no party.
Just get off my doughnut already.
Don't lie to me, Boyle, or you will be eating your bone marrow custard through a straw.
That's exactly how you're supposed to eat bone marrow - Charles!
- Ah!
All right, there's a party.
I can't give you details.
All I can say is I know you, and I know you'll have a good time.
If you knew me, you'd know I hate surprise parties, so clearly you don't know me at all.
What?
We're friends.
I was building up to calling you "Ro-ro" one of these days.
That will never happen.
In fact, you just lost "Rosa" privileges.
From now on, you can call me "Diaz" or "Hey, you".
Come on, Rosa.
Come on, hey, you.
Wow, champagne and oysters.
You really shouldn't have, guys.
Well, it's a special night.
So when did you guys meet?
- Last year.
- Five years ago.
We first met five years ago, but we don't count it, because I was dating a speedboat model at the time.
And I was dating a super handsome comptroller of a major U.S. city.
Anyways, about a year ago, we bumped into each other at a bar, and we haven't been able to keep our hands off each other since.
Mm.
So how did you know she was the one?
I'd love to answer that.
Um, you know, just whenever I look at her face and the attached physique.
And you?
Uh He makes me laugh.
And, you know, there's really no one else's opinion who I care about more than hers, so Okay, so enough chitchat Let's see the ring.
I don't have it on me.
She has gigantic fingers.
What I mean to say is that the ring I got would never have fit on her fingers, because they are that of a giant, behemoth person.
Madeline, thank you for coming.
Raymond, always a pleasure to call on a vanquished foe.
I feel like Jackie Joyner-Kersee congratulating one of the other slower runners.
Buckle up.
It's gonna be a hell of a ride.
Care to sit?
I'm sure you'd like to take some weight off your cloven hooves.
Calling me the devil?
How original, Raymond.
Actually I was calling you a goat, you goat.
Oh.
I'd like to talk about my promotion.
Very well, but first, how do I know you're not wearing a wire?
I need to pat you down.
If you must.
What is going on?
Shh.
I'm watching something.
Can you get the car from the valet, babe?
I'm gonna in the back and say hi to the chef.
Good luck on your wedding, guys.
Oh, have fun on your honeymoon.
We will.
We're going to Waco, Texas.
Huh.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
- Waco, Texas?
- I don't know.
It was just on Dateline.
All right, well, Augustine took the laptop case with him.
He's gonna make the drop.
Let's go.
Look, there's the buyer.
Or maybe he's just actually saying hi to the chef?
Why isn't he making the handoff?
Oh, crap, he saw us.
Uh, Excuse me.
Oh, hey.
We were just looking for a place to, uh Boink.
Yep.
Boink.
That's my preferred term for it as well.
I get it.
Newly engaged kids.
Enjoy.
Thanks.
Good.
Good, good, good, good.
We kept our cover intact.
Ce work.
Quick, professional thinking out there.
Very quick Very professional.
- Detective.
- Detective.
- Let's get back on the case.
- Yes.
So how was the restaurant?
Such a normal time!
Why are you being weird?
Amy and I kissed.
What?
To keep our cover from being blown; we didn't have a choice.
Tell me everything!
Charles, it was just a kiss, okay?
It was for work.
It was nothing.
Yeah, who cares about a kiss?
Call me if you grab each other's asses.
He's pulling over.
It's going down.
You guys are so naive.
It's never nothing.
In high school, I played Daddy Warbucks in Annie, Becca Murse played Annie, and we were supposed to hug onstage.
And at first, that seemed like nothing too, but by opening night, we were full-on making out.
As Daddy Warbucks and Annie?
Mm-hmm.
The audience was not on board.
Playwright sued the school.
Guys, guys, it's not a handoff.
He's leaving the package.
Okay, you and Rosa follow Augustine.
Right, and you and Amy follow your hearts.
No, we're gonna stay with the package.
And each other forever.
Come on, man!
So here's how I see this going down.
You plead for your job back.
I refuse.
You start weeping like a war widow.
Does that sound about right?
Don't count your gross fish babies before they've hatched, Madeline.
How did you get this?
Gina and Terry got it, you grackle.
It doesn't matter how I got it.
Sorry, sir, didn't realize that was how you wanted to play it.
I see you've got an audience for this little stunt?
Yes, well, who wouldn't want to see a man fight a crocodile?
Now, Madeline, before one of us starts weeping like a war widow, would you like to give me my precinct back?
It's not that simple; I can't just reverse your promotion.
You have until tomorrow, you grackle.
We can't pull him over this close to the drop site.
It'll alert the buyer.
I say we follow him for a mile.
Copy that.
How's your mom enjoying the new phone you got her for her birthday on March 16th?
Dude, stop saying random facts to try to prove you know me.
That's not what I'm doing.
I'm simply making small talk with my friend Rosa, who went skydiving once.
Enough!
I'm going to the dumb party but only because I don't want to hurt Marcus.
I'm still super mad at you.
Mm, like how you're still super mad at Gilmore Girls for how the finale went down?
Oh, I just want to see Lorelai happy, and shut up!
Ah, see?
I knew you so well, I knew it was co ah!
Hey, seriously, we're cool, right?
Yeah, totally.
- We're fine.
- Good.
Gosh, you know, I'm actually a little bit hungry.
I never ended up eating at that dumb fancy restaurant.
You know what I'm getting on my way home?
Yeah, you're gonna go to the Polish place and get perogies, potato pancakes, and a cup of hot chocolate.
That's exactly what I'm gonna get.
Yeah.
I will be having pizza, two slices of meat supreme from Tony's, served display temperature.
Meat supreme is a million red flags, and eating it cold is just insane.
No, no, no.
It's not cold.
- It's display temperature.
- Jake.
There's a difference, Amy.
No, Jake, he's looking at us.
- Well, this is happening.
- Huh?
NYPD!
Freeze!
We are police colleagues!
You're under arrest.
This is a work event.
Hey, can you sign this arrest report for Augustine and the buyer?
Sure.
Great.
Man, I forgot how long your signature takes.
I'm just gonna watch Braveheart on my phone real quick.
Given the circumstances, I could see how that might have seemed like flirty teasing or something, but I was legit being critical.
You have a problem.
No, even that sounded like banter now.
All right, there's only one way out of this for me.
I just got to get super cruel.
Prepare to have your physical flaws pointed out, Amy.
I'm talking about your tall butt and your weird elbows.
Jake, it's okay.
Thank you.
This whole night was really weird.
I know.
I just ugh.
I want everything to go back how it was, you know?
It's so awkward.
- Yeah.
- And you're right.
We shouldn't date cops, 'cause we're a great team.
We work great together.
I don't want to mess that up.
Yeah, I don't want everything to change.
Yeah, me neither.
Okay, then that's that, Detective Peralta.
Detective Santiago.
See you around the precinct.
Yep.
Tall butt.
Okay, before we go in, remember you have to pretend to be surprised.
How's this?
Oh, my God.
It's so much worse than I imagined.
The energy was great, but the message was flawed.
All right, let's get this over with.
Surprise.
What's going on?
I rented this entire bar so you and I could celebrate with no people anywhere near us.
I probably should have hired a bartender, though.
I have no idea how to make drinks.
This is incredible.
It was all Charles' idea.
I told you I knew you, Ro-ro.
Thank you.
But never call me "Ro-ro" again.
Oh, but I will.
I've earned this.
Happy b-day, Ro-ro.
Whoo!
Welcome, Madeline.
Have you thought things over?
I have, but first, how do I know you're not wearing a wire?
So I've thought it over, and perhaps you should go ahead and show that letter to the commissioner.
And let him fire you?
I'll deny I wrote it.
It will take months to authenticate, which will give me plenty of time to make some personnel changes around here.
There's an opening for a detective down in Brighton Beach.
I think I'll transfer Diaz there.
Detective Boyle I'll send to Long Island City.
Santiago will be a great fit for Pelham Bay.
And Peralta, your little pet project, I'm gonna ship him off to Staten Island.
Hope he likes breaking up tanning salon fistfights.
Looks like you've got a decision to make, Raymond.
What are you gonna do?
Squad, if I could have your attention please?
I am being transferred to the public relations office.
I'm leaving the Nine-Nine effective immediately.
- What the hell?
- I don't understand.
- What the hell?
- Why are you doing this?
What the hell?
I want to say it has been a pleasure to have worked alongside all of you for the past 21 1/2 months.
I'm sorry for getting so emotional.
A pretty consistent tone, actually.
These have been the these have been the best years of my career.
Oh, no.
This is new.
And I know that everyone of you gave me everything you had, and I will never forget it.
Go back to being robot captain.
Meep-morp.
Zeet.
Dismissed.
Sir!
I'm coming with you.
- Thank you, Gina.
- I'm also coming.
Not necessary.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Thought I might find you in here.
I just needed to process the captain's news.
I feel so bad for him.
So how are you holding up?
I don't know.
I'm still in shock.
You?
Um, basically handling it the way I dealt with my dad leaving, just repressing the hell out of it.
So a lot of change around here, huh?
Hey, Jake, the new captain's here.
Who do you think it's gonna be?
I have no idea.
I bet it's me.
I just hope I'm ready.
Wow.
Come on, guys.
I know you're sad, but let's do our best to make a good first impression here.
Smart.
Good call.
Jake, you be up front.
Okay, here we go.
