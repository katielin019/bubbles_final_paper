{START OF EPISODE 1}
1   - Joel.
- Shh.
No words, my love.
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just not really a "pound one out" kind of gal.
I know, and that's great.
You like romance and lavender candles and a massage with essential oils and a wonderful meal but not too heavy.
You're making fun of me.
No.
I'm only saying that sometimes, maybe even now, - we might try - Humping?
Like that rescue dog did to that little girl at the Rite Aid?
Jennifer Lawrence chopped off her hair again.
Everybody hates it like that but she doesn't care.
She's so bold.
I wish I was bold.
Am I bold?
No, I'm not.
I'm really upset about the new toaster oven.
I'd like to be 20 percent bolder.
No, more, 80 percent.
No, that's too much.
Look at all the slack in these knobs.
You can't set an accurate temperature.
Yeah, I know, honey.
Did you send them an e-mail?
No, I re-read it.
It came across a little crazy.
Well I need a car.
I can't live here anymore without a car.
We're in the middle of freaking nowhere.
- We're not buying you a car.
- You don't need to buy me a car.
Buy Mom a new car, I'll take hers.
Like a normal family.
- I like the Range Rover.
- Ah.
You'd look good in that.
Why don't you love Mom enough to buy her a Range Rover?
-  Ow.
- Well What?
What is it?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I just have this, like, sharp  Here, sit down.
Oh.
Is Mom dying?
- Stop it.
- I don't know, parents die.
I'm not dying, honey.
I probably just ate something.
I'm fine.
See?
All better.
- Are you sure?
You scared me.
- Yeah, me too.
Makes you think life is short.
You're not getting a car.
Maybe we can hang out after school.
Go to the Tea Garden together.
Why?
Because I love you and I don't see you very much.
- I think this is working.
-  - Joel.
- Dan.
Noticed a light on in your den all night.
Oh, okay.
Someone's gonna get in trouble.
Just kidding, no one's in trouble.
- Unusual, that's all.
- Dan.
- I had trouble sleeping, so I was up.
- You had trouble sleeping?
- Problem?
- Dan, leave people alone.
- Cop brain, sorry.
- I'm not a cop, baby.
- LA Sheriff's Department, all the way.
- Mm-hmm.
Dickless over there is a cop.
Morning, puss.
Another day in pretend law enforcement?
Have a good day, Dan.
Be safe.
Santa Monica PD.
Shitbirds.
Be careful today chasing bad guys, honey bunch.
Oh, that's right, they don't allow pursuits in Santa Monica.
Worried it might hurt somebody's feelings.
- Just trying not to kill civilians, Dan.
-  We protect and serve, not frame and maim like the sheriff's department.
- Suck me, Rick.
-  Joel, Sheila.
Why do we gotta live between two cops?
Why couldn't it be two rival pastry chefs?
- I don't know.
- See you at the Petersons'.
Do you have everything you need?
-  Yes, Mom.
- I'm just checking.
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, honey.
Abby.
- You look so pretty today.
-  Eric worships you.
You're the queen of his spank bank.
Mom, please!
Okay.
Hey, some of us girls are going out tonight.
Drinking, dancing, etcetera.
You wanna come?
No, I can't, um, tonight.
- But thank you.
- You're so flustered.
We're not banging dudes.
At least that's what we tell our husbands.
You're funny.
Have a nice day.
Sheila Hammond, say hello to Gary West.
Gary was rocking it up in Sacramento.
Now he's all ours.
- Hi, Gary.
Uh, welcome aboard.
- Thank you, Sheila.
I'm very excited to be here.
Sheila works with her husband.
She's the pretty one.
You two gonna sell the Peterson house today?
We're gonna try, Carl.
None of this "try" bullshit.
Do it!
Oh, you're yelling at me.
The Petersons are nervous.
We cannot lose this goddamn listing.
Well, this is the third time these buyers have been at the house.
- Get an offer!
- Mm-hmm.
Get an offer.
- That's what realtors do.
- Okay.
Come on, I'll show you your office.
It's small.
It's nice meeting you.
I'm so sorry you got yelled at.
Same.
I mean, nice meeting you, not sorry I got yelled at.
- Well, actually both.
-  The master has been completely remodeled.
Lots of light and brand-new textured plush carpeting.
- All headed in the same direction.
-  It's just lovely.
Do you know what my favorite thing about the upstairs is?
- The laundry chute.
- Oh, it's amazing.
It was so  -  - Oh, my God.
Wow!
Wow.
Honey, you okay?
I'm sorry.
We are gonna call a crew and immediately get that cleaned up.
Maybe we should reschedule.
Great idea.
I could run you up to that Cape Cod on Barnhill.
No, please.
I don't wanna make everyone have to come back.
I'm just gonna go use the restroom really quickly, and call the cleaning crew.
I'll be right back, excuse me.
- Okay, other bedrooms.
- Yes, this way.
New skylights really open it up, don't you think?
- I love the crown molding in here.
- Mmm.
- Just beautiful.
- Yeah.
I wanna leave.
Sheila.
-  - Sheila Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Sheila.
Sheila.
Sheila?
Sheila.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
Oh!
Sheila.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Did we get the offer?
-  Oh, what the fuck?
I'm okay.
I just threw up.
Like a fair amount.
Yeah.
And that came out of me.
Do you think it's an organ?
I really am feeling better, honey.
I wanna get you looked at.
We've been here over three hours.
I just wanna go home, get out of these clothes and take a bath.
I feel like a bus station shit in my mouth.
I'll go see what's happening.
Excuse me.
Do not ask me again how long it's gonna be.
This isn't a deli counter.
The most life-threatening conditions have priority.
Your wife threw up.
- A lot.
- Your wife threw up.
- A lot.
- Okay, we're not doing this.
Hold on.
Gonna call your doctor and make you some soup.
You lost a lot of fluids.
Mmm I'm okay with you smoking pot.
Excuse me?
I know I complain about it so you try to hide it, but I just want you to be the Joel you want to be.
- That's -  - That's really nice, sweetheart.
-   - Sheila.
- Gary.
This is Gary, the new realtor I was telling you about.
Gary, my husband, Joel.
- Hey, Gary.
- Hi there.
So how are you feeling?
I heard about your afternoon.
- Much better, thank you.
- Oh, these are for you.
And I made sure the cleaning crew got in there okay.
They took care of everything so don't worry about that.
- Thank you, Gary.
That is so sweet.
- So sweet.
Well, we'd invite you in, but Don't even think about it.
But listen Joel, can I talk to you a moment?
I'm gonna go get cleaned up.
Thanks for the flowers, Gar, and all your help.
No problem.
Feel better.
That was a crazy amount of vomit.
Well, I'm not a medical expert, so I can't say what the proper amount of vomit is.
- It was a huge amount.
- Are you a doctor, Gary?
- No.
- Neither am I. So let's not dishonor that profession, which takes eight years of intense training, by thinking we can give medical opinions, okay?
Fine, then let's just stick to facts.
The homeowners came by, they didn't like what they saw.
So they don't want to work with you anymore.
They'll be working with me now.
You're stealing our listing?
No, the facts are they fired you, then hired me.
And that was an insane amount of vomit.
Everything's good.
Gary just needed some advice.
I helped him out.
I can't feel my heartbeat.
- What?
- My heart.
I can't feel it.
I love your hair.
Yeah.
Like that.
Bingo.
- Can I help you?
- What?
My manager noticed that you've been staring at the stethoscopes for, like, a really long time.
There's something happening with my wife.
Oh, well, I'm only 20, so Right.
Sorry.
Do you know the difference between the dual-headed stethoscopes and the single-headed ones?
Well, dual would be two.
I see.
So twice as many then.
It's not just a physical thing, she's acting different.
I'm gonna get this one.
It doesn't make sense.
My jaw still kinda hurts.
Then stop talking.
I don't hear anything.
-  I know, right?
- There's something else.
But no one freak out because I feel fine.
Look.
No blood.
Aah Still, no one freak out.
Oh, shit.
-  Is the juice helping?
- Uh-huh.
Yep.
I can cook that meat for you, sweetheart.
I'm fine.
- We should go back to the emergency room.
- No.
I'm sorry.
Look, I know things are very wrong but I feel good.
I have all this energy and, like, a focus.
I can't go to a hospital where they're gonna put me in a tube and prick me and poke me.
They might never let me come home again.
Bad for you because we're having spectacular sex.
Ew.
Ew!
Whatever this is, we need to talk to someone because we are not experts.
And this is just the sort of thing the Internet will have a lot of misinformation about.
-  I know someone.
- Who?
- A creeper.
- What's a creeper?
The kind of a nerd who specializes in disturbing, weird or gruesome shit.
No pupillary response.
Have you noticed any deteriorating flesh?
- No?
- Blackening of the skin, digits or other pieces falling off?
- No.
- Okay.
- Um, have you eaten anyone?
- No.
- But I may have thrown up an organ.
- No worries.
-  Hello.
- We already said hello.
From when you came in.
I haven't had this many people in my room before.
- You're doing fine.
- Thank you.
Do you guys want chairs?
- We just want to know what's going on.
- Right.
Well she is dead - and also undead.
- What the fuck?
I'm sorry.
What are you saying?
She's a zombie?
I don't like that word, I think it's inherently negative.
- I don't like it either.
- Let's not use it.
I don't feel dead and undead.
I feel the opposite.
Totally alive.
She's been very - exuberant.
- Exuberant?
Yeah, they're doing it a lot.
Okay.
Well, one thing we know about the undead is they're completely driven by their id.
The id is a part of the brain that demands us to satisfy our desires.
- I know what the id is.
- It just - wants whatever it wants.
- I sit behind you in Psych.
- I know.
- How could this happen?
We're realtors.
Well, most new viruses come from animals, like monkeys or bats.
As humans destroy their habitats, we're exposed to all kinds of unfamiliar diseases.
I mean, we're the real so-called zombies, aren't we?
Consuming everything we want without any regard for consequences.
As we destroy the Earth so, too, do we destroy ourselves.
So, then, a bat or a monkey?
Maybe.
Anything else we should know?
Not that we know anything.
Always keep her fed.
I'm pretty sure we don't want to find out what happens when she's hungry.
And if she starts to show more symptoms, like, uh, deterioration or aggression, you may have to What?
Um Bash her brains in.
We're realtors.
Okay, until we know more, we cannot tell anyone about this, especially your mother.
Although it is hard to imagine how she'd blow this out of proportion.
What a beautiful afternoon.
We should do something.
- Let's buy a Range Rover.
- Fuck yeah.
No.
We are going home and coming up with a plan.
We need answers.
How'd this happen?
How do we fix it?
- Has it affected anyone else?
- Ooh!
Look what I found.
- Don't eat a snail.
-  Oh  - Crunchy.
- Okay.
Oh, crap.
Hey, Dan.
How was work?
- Lisa home?
-  No, no.
Should be soon, though, I'm guessing.
- Yeah, I don't know her schedule.
- What are you all doing here?
What are you all doing here?
That's funny.
- We were just talking to Eric.
- Eric?
Why?
Because we found a football in our backyard, we thought it might be his.
Eric doesn't own a football or anything else that would make him come outside.
That's exactly what he said, only with less implied criticism, so mystery not solved.
Then, uh, where's the football?
- Run.
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
- Shoot her!
Shoot her!
We threw it back over the fence.
So, as you would say, "case closed".
"Shoot her, shoot her".
Really?
You would be a terrible partner in a crime spree.
Uh, it's called self-preservation.
And it's an instinct you should be happy I have.
That is exactly what we don't want.
Now Dan is suspicious.
- What if he asks Eric about it?
- Eric won't say anything.
- How do you know?
- Because Eric hates his stepdad.
That's sad, I feel bad Eric has a crappy stepdad.
Maybe we should adopt Eric.
Out of the question.
Look, you need to fight this a little.
Be a little less impulsive.
I'm hungry.
And there's no hamburger left.
I'll go get you some food, but then we're coming up with a plan.
- Keep her here.
- All right.
- I'm serious, don't go anywhere.
- All right.
- Whoo!
-  You should slow down.
I need you to slow down.
Please slow down.
- Oh!
Oh, God!
- Whoo-hoo!
Faster, faster, faster!
Oh, ohh-ohh!
I got organic, I don't know if that's still important.
Oh.
What happened to your hair?
Where's your mom?
- Yes!
-  I'm glad you finally decided to join us.
This is fantastic.
From now on, always include me in everything.
I can't believe you just went out and bought yourself a Range Rover.
I've been wanting one ever since this morning.
I think it's great.
You're my new role model.
Yeah, if we want something, we should have it, damn it.
End of story.
I'm gonna get some of those Christian Louboutins.
They're fucking expensive, but fuck it.
There's a cute guy at the bar looking at you.
Oh, hello, he is cute.
Do you know him?
Oh.
His name is Gary.
He just moved here.
You like him.
Are you two gonna bone?
- Lisa.
- What?
We decided we shouldn't deny ourselves things, and boning is a thing.
Sheila, let's go home.
- No, honey, I don't want to.
- Yeah.
Come on, let's dance.
Sweetheart, you bought a car, and now you're grinding on the neighbors, and this is not who you are.
Maybe it is.
Maybe it's who I've always wanted to be.
Maybe it's not who you are.
- Honey.
- Is there a problem?
Oh, God, not you.
Look, Joel, obviously you're upset, but if Sheila doesn't wanna go with you Shut up, Gary.
- Sheila - Life should be fun, honey.
And I don't care what Consumer Reports says, that car is hot.
She wants to have fun, Joel.
And doesn't care what Consumer Reports says.
I heard her, Gary.
- Sheila?
- Then maybe you should go.
You know, 15 years ago, I would have punched you, once.
I might have dropped you.
If not, you would have beaten the hell out of me, 'cause I just had the one move, and you're a substantial man.
But now I have a family, a career, a life.
I'm not gonna be the guy who gets into bar fights.
- You mean loses bar fights.
- You're missing my point.
You don't wanna get into a fight because you're afraid you might lose.
That is exactly wrong.
- The losing is a given.
- Damn straight.
- And it's irrelevant.
- You mean inevitable.
Goddamn it, you're frustrating.
At this point in my life, - I'm not gonna be the kind of person - Who wins a bar fight.
- God fuck, what's the matter with you?
- You are.
I'm trying to explain a very simple concept.
You are.
I'm just gonna call this a draw and go home.
Have fun.
Joel, come back.
Hey, I'm sorry for butting in.
I just don't like seeing a woman treated badly.
- It's not gonna work.
- No?
Really?
How about this?
- Oh.
- Hmm.
Oh, my.
Huh?
You happy now, big man?
You are.
My manager noticed that you've been staring at the toaster ovens for, like, a really long Oh, it's you.
Hey, do you know which one of these has a knob without any slack?
No.
Does it matter?
I thought so.
I really did, but maybe it doesn't.
Maybe I shouldn't care about toaster knobs, or being responsible, or descending into chaos.
Why should I be the only one in my family who gives a crap, right?
Who sucks it up?
This one's cheaper.
Maybe I want to have fun, drive a fancy car, dance like a sex lunatic, hmm?
- You're a good dancer.
- You're missing the point, Ramona.
I don't want to dance.
And I don't want another shitty toaster oven.
I'm outta here.
Hi.
Gary.
I rang the bell then I saw your car in the driveway, so I'm just gardening.
It relaxes me.
What's up?
I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
Because I didn't wanna have sex with you last night?
I'm fine.
We were in the middle of dancing and then you just strolled off.
I had a lot on my mind.
I ended up walking around all night.
Checked out a Dumpster behind Chili's.
They throw away a lot of raw meat.
-  - Whoa, okay.
- How about we start over?
- I don't think so.
- Are you sure?
- I am.
Are you?
I feel like whatever I say is just going to mean you push harder against my vagina.
Okay, I was right.
- Listen, Gary - Shh How about this?
We have some fun.
You said you're all about fun.
And I don't say anything to your lame husband.
Or we don't, and I tell him we screwed four times last night in my beamer.
Your unwillingness to take no for an answer has made me feel sexy and desirable.
Hmm?
-  - Uh-huh?
Oh.
-  - Aaah!
I know, weirdest foreplay ever.
You ate my fingers.
- I do not hate your fingers.
- "Ate," ate my fingers.
Ohh   Sheila?
Sheila, we need to talk.
Last night was bullshit.
Sheila!
Sheil  Oh, Joel.
I really want to make this work.
I walked for miles Oh, with my head in my hand Ooh, ooh She ripped my chest wide open Once was a child I'm now surely a man Ooh, ooh She ripped my chest wide open She ripped my chest wide open Oh, she ripped my chest Wide open, yeah We were head over heels I was doing cartwheels No romance, no appeals Just the way my heart feels Wild and fine from New Orleans Tattoo on her thigh Of a fleur-de-lis In a little silk dress That she bought secondhand She'd do a little dance I could see her silhouette Good God I wished to knock that out Rattle the walls In that shotgun house Good Lord, how we used to party hard Half-dead flying home from Mardi Gras The shit we did We should've been arrested Shit, I fell for her Well, I should have guessed it Should have known then That no one can tame that Fire on the Bayou No way to contain that Would've exchanged vows Church with stained glass Now I'm passed out Laid across the train tracks I walked for miles Oh, with my head in my hands Ooh, ooh She ripped my chest wide open Once was a child I'm now surely a man Ooh, ooh She ripped my chest wide open She ripped my chest wide open Oh, she ripped my chest Wide open, yeah Ooh, she ripped my chest Wide open, yeah Ooh, ooh She ripped my chest wide open Yeah, yeah
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1   -  -  Guess what Kelly told me last night?
She and Ben are selling their home.
It's a beautiful property.
Great location, new kitchen, marble countertops.
Detached bonus room.
I think they'll give us the listing.
Joel, sweetheart.
The listing.
That'd be great, honey.
We can't be realtors if we don't have listings.
It's so basic.
It's so fucking basic.
Oh, my  - Would've been nice to have the lid.
-  I couldn't find it.
Right.
You'd think it would've been stored with the container, is all.
I can look for it when we get home, sweetheart.
When we get home?
What good would the lid be when our container is stuffed with half a fucking body, and is buried in the fucking desert honey?
- You're swearing a lot tonight.
- Yeah, I've noticed that too.
Well, obviously, sweetie, I didn't know we'd be burying the container.
What did you think, honeybunch?
We'd take it home with us and clean it out and use it to store our taxes, which we can't do because it doesn't have a fucking lid.
- Fine, I won't look for it.
- Oh, shit.
Someone's coming.
-  - Oh, crap!
- Who could be out here?
- I don't know.
- Hurry.
Let's get this in the ground.
-  Okay.
-  - Aah!
Do not bring up the lid.
Come on, scoop this up, get it in the hole.
- We can't get caught.
- I know.
Who will take care of Abby?
We can't leave Abby.
I know.
Hurry, get up.
Act casual.
Really?
This is what we're doing?
Okay, we say we came across this murder site and we're just cleaning it up.
- Who cleans up murder sites?
- I don't know.
We're Mormons.
- Mormons don't clean up murder sites.
- Mormons are helpful.
Yeah, I'm just not seeing it.
Yaaah!
- Joel, no!
- Dad, stop!
Oh.
Abby, what are you doing here?
I saw the broken toaster in the yard, and there was blood on the lawn, and no one was home, and I didn't know what was happening.
So she came to me for help.
I'm pretty calm in a crisis.
Eric borrowed his stepdad's car.
Please don't tell Dan.
He loves this car.
Keeps it covered with a blanket in the garage, which is how I'll end up if he finds out I took it.
-  How did you find us?
- You put that tracker app on our phones.
Oh, yeah, that thing's great.
So I guess we'll see you at home, then.
- Oh, my God, did you kill someone?
- No!
Jesus!
We were out for a drive Yes, I did.
Okay, we're not gonna lie.
Would've been good to know.
He was not a good man, Abby.
He didn't listen to my words.
-  Stay down, Gary.
- But you only ate some of him?
He weighed, like, 180 pounds.
Ah, the undead equivalent of over-ordering.
Honey, I did not want to get you or your dad involved in this.
Your mom is a monster.
I ate someone.
And if you want me to go away, I will.
No one's going anywhere.
Yeah.
Sorry.
The less time spent at a crime scene, the better.
What do you know about it?
My stepdad's a cop and I enjoy the Internet, and the first thing about crime is you don't wanna get caught.
- Did this guy have a family?
- No.
- He moved here, like, a week ago.
-  Perfect.
Uh, you didn't eat his keys, did you?
We toss Gary's bag, drive his car to Burbank, and leave it at the airport.
Guy like Gary, hopefully, people will just think he skipped town.
That's ingenious.
We should be ingenious more often.
It's kinda fun.
I disagree.
In fact, until we solve whatever this is, I'd like you to meet me halfway.
At least, control some of your impulses.
- I swear, I did not have sex with Gary.
- I believe you.
But I did eat his balls.
Well, one of them.
Does that count as meeting you halfway?
What I meant was, it'd be good for everyone if, from now on, you only ate chicken or beef.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, totally, I agree.
And we need to return the Range Rover.
- Sheila?
- Fine.
I should've eaten both of his balls.
It'd be great if we didn't talk about Gary's balls anymore.
Sure.
They were tiny anyway.
What?
I thought you'd like that.
This will mask any traces of blood.
But tell your dad to dilute it three-to-one or he'll kill his lawn.
- Intense night, huh?
-  Yeah.
Thank you, Eric.
"Thank you, Eric".
Carl called.
He's mad because he can't find Gary.
Because he's, you know, buried half-eaten in the desert, without a lid, which I did find, by the way.
I found something, too.
Not as exciting as a lid without a box, but maybe more useful.
There's a virologist at City College who specializes in rare viruses.
I'm gonna go see him, get a second opinion from someone who's not 16.
Okay.
That's great, honey.
But why didn't you tell me that Gary stole the Peterson listing from us?
Well, there was a lot going on, what with you killing him.
Well, that couple is going back to the house today, and Carl said if Gary doesn't turn up, which he won't, or, at least, not enough of him to show a house, he wants us to do it.
This is good.
We should get our lives back to normal anyway, so no one gets suspicious.
- Why not show a house?
- I agree.
I'm gonna get dressed and go.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?
You're going to see the virus guy.
I'll pick you up after, and we'll go to the house together.
Don't you trust me?
Well, you did disembowel a man and buy a Range Rover yesterday.
- Speaking of the Range Rover - Which we have to return.
It can't be returned.
State law.
New automobile sales are final.
Damn you, California, for making us own such a super nice car.
Don't worry, Joel.
We're gonna sell the Peterson house together.
We really need to now.
I love you, Joel.
Thank you for being my husband.
I love you too, Sheila.
We're gonna figure this out.
Yeah, but later.
'Cause right now, I want to hump like a rescue dog at a Rite Aid.
Hey, porn stars.
- Oh.
- Gah.
Dan's in the backyard looking at our grass.
- A good development?
I don't think so.
- I'll go see what's up.
- Are you okay, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm 16.
I can deal with shit.
By the way, I'm gonna be swearing in front of you guys now.
Fair enough.
And I'm only gonna be eating packaged meats from now on.
We're gonna get our lives back to normal.
We'll just have this little family secret.
Kind of like the time when Dad got himself in the paper for putting out that fire he started.
This isn't hanging a piÃ±ata too close to the campfire.
There's a cop in our backyard who could send you to jail for murder.
I'm going.
Hey, Dan.
What's up?
Noticed you were spraying your lawn in the night with some kind of chemical.
Yeah.
- We have ants.
- Ants?
Yeah.
You know  They don't look like that, but we have them.
And you needed to spray for them at 2:45 in the morning?
- I was up.
I figured they were, too.
- What's going on?
Apparently, Dan saw us out here last night and was wondering what we were doing.
How about it's none of your fucking business, Dan?
- Maybe that's what we were doing.
-  I bet, as sheriff deputy, people don't usually talk to you like that because it only arouses suspicion, where there shouldn't be any.
So we were spraying for ants and that's settled.
Listen, it's not great that you walk into our yard like this.
So let's not do that anymore.
You wanna stay on top of an ant problem, Joel.
It could overwhelm you.
Right but remember my thing, too.
Excuse me.
Do you know where I might find Dr. Hasmedi's office?
- What do you need him for?
- I just have a few questions.
Fine.
Don't tell me.
I'm fucking with you, man.
No one tells me anything, so we're cool.
End of the hall, make a left, then a right.
Thank you.
Whatever douchebag.
- Come in.
- Dr. Hasmedi?
- Yes?
- Hi, I'm Joel Wichita.
Wichita, like the city?
I guess.
I just have a few questions about something that's happening to a friend that I'm wondering if might be a virus and where I might go for help.
Mmm.
Uh-oh.
So the person's blood is dry?
Not like a powder, more just thick.
Kind of a tar-like substance.
- Tar?
- Like substance.
- And they only eat raw meat.
- That's right.
And they threw up this.
Hmm.
I didn't have formaldehyde, so I saved it in olive oil.
That was good thinking.
Do you mind if I ask a colleague to join us?
If you think that'll help, great.
Hey.
Wait, why aren't you in class?
After last night, school just seems so trivial.
I could not listen to Mrs. Flothman talk about the Punic Wars.
So you're just leaving?
Yeah, like the Punics did from Sicily.
Huh.
I was listening.
-  - Who is this?
Oh, uh, I built him for science.
He can walk and talk.
King Robot Baratheon, say hi to Abby.
Fucking thing.
I spent like six weeks on it.
- Well, good luck.
- Wait.
Where are you going?
I have no idea.
I've never ditched before.
Hang on.
I'll come with you.
I know a place we can go.
Okay.
Okay.
-  -  Nice to meet you.
You are unbelievable.
- Do you think it's an organ?
- Do you think it's an organ?
It might be.
What do you think it means?
- What do you think it means?
- I don't know.
Death?
- Where'd you get it?
- I told you, my friend threw it up.
Mr. Wichita, I'd like you to come with me to the fifth floor.
Why?
What's going on up there?
Until we figure out what this is and who it came from, I think it'd be best for you to stay with us.
- You're not a virologist, are you?
- No.
- You're a psychiatrist?
- Yes.
But she's excellent.
- Hi, honey.
-  How did it go?
Well, they haven't heard about any outbreaks, but they might be chasing me.
- What's up?
- Carl called.
- And the buyers want to come now.
- Now?
What did you tell him?
To shut the fuck up.
Oh, God.
You gotta stop saying that to people.
Well, he's always yelling.
I don't like it anymore.
All right, stay put.
I'll be there in 45 minutes.
- Did you eat today?
- I wasn't hungry.
And I'm already at the listing.
Christ.
Okay, I'm on my way.
Try not to swear at anybody.
- Fuck you, I'm not an idiot.
- There you go.
Like that.
I think you should eat something.
You know how you get.
I can't eat meat anymore.
What do you mean?
That's all you can eat.
I've been trying all morning, and it repulses me since I've had Gary.
Well, we can't start killing people.
We're getting life back to normal.
And killing people isn't normal, sweetheart.
- I know.
- Then dig in!
What if, once I've tasted human flesh, I can't go back?
Okay.
Maybe it's the freshness of it, not the human-ness.
Because Gary was super fresh.
Maybe you can only eat an animal if it's just been killed.
Could that be it?
- What if it's not?
- What if it is?
- What if it's not?
- What if it is?
All I know is that I'm getting hungry.
You ate yesterday.
Thank you, food police.
You eat every day.
- That's them.
-  Let me take the lead.
I really think that'll work best.
Okay, I'll try.
I'm just not sure holding back is my thing anymore.
- What if it is?
- What if it's not?
What if it?
- Hi!
- Welcome!
- Where's Gary?
- No one knows.
- Which is so Gary.
- Wild.
Are you feeling okay?
- Totally.
- She's great.
We're gonna take such good care of you.
- Yay.
- Yay.
And you remember the beautiful master bedroom, with south-facing windows and impossible-to-stain texture-plush carpeting.
Mm, I love this room.
Then you should buy it, along with all the other rooms.
Leslie, Bill, what are you doing?
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me?
This is your fourth time here.
- I mean, come on.
- Honey We're just nervous about such a big investment.
Look, here's the deal with life.
No matter how much we want to control it, we can't always know where it's going to take us.
Change is scary.
Right, sweetheart?
Let's look at the kitchen.
Everyone is afraid of change, but when life is screaming, "This is your new truth," you need to accept it, be bold, be brave, and live your new truth, no matter what it is.
Hmm.
Okay, I would just add that sometimes we may think life is telling us our truth, but we might not have enough information yet.
So, it's important to explore all the options and exhaust every possibility before doing something crazy.
But, of course, you should buy this house.
Is that a rooster?
Comforting, like being on a farm.
Uh, actually, loud.
Especially first thing in the morning.
Maybe you should go next door, see what that's about.
Check out that very live bird.
Mmm.
I'll do that because I, too, would like to find a simple solution to this problem.
The owners have had a few offers fall through, so they're very motivated.
I'm taking you to the kitchen and I mean it this time.
I appreciate you ditching with me.
I'm just not sure a comic book store is gonna be my thing.
That's like saying every world you could ever imagine isn't your thing.
This place is great.
You're gonna really like it here.
- Hey, Bunchen.
- Thirty seconds, Eric.
We can't read anything for more than 30 seconds without buying it.
- This is Abby.
- Hey.
Thirty seconds.
He has a master's in art history and lives with his mom, so he's pretty angry.
Night Scurrier.
A hideous mutant lives in sludge at the bottom of a swamp, where he feels nothing but shame.
Aww.
He just needs to meet the right girl.
Yeah.
It's just hard because he's mostly seaweed.
Oh.
- So how are you doing?
- Why does everyone keep asking me that?
I don't know why other people do, but I'm asking because you saw your mom and dad scrape a half-eaten dead guy into a grave.
Please.
I once walked in on my grandparents changing in a cabana.
That was intense.
Besides, Mom and Dad want our lives to go back to normal, so I guess that's what's happening.
Thirty seconds!
Parents always want life to be normal.
When my mom and dad got divorced, my mom said everything would be the same, but nothing was.
My dad left town and my mom married a horrible dickwad shithead asshole who she thinks I'm too critical of.
Mombie.
That's not a good one.
- It's okay.
I'm I'm okay.
- That's nothing like your mom, Abby.
Your mom may stay exactly like she is forever and everything will be fine.
I know.
I'm just looking at it.
- Thirty seconds!
- What does it matter, Bunchen?
- Eric!
- It's all good.
Uh, come on, Abby.
Here, check out Njor Skuvelkrodd.
It's from the Netherlands.
Brilliant stuff.
Njor gets lost in time and becomes his own lover.
Mombie eats the family dog?
Why would she do that?
Because she's crazy.
It doesn't mean anything.
- Hey, why don't we go to the beach, huh?
- Thirty seconds, Eric's friend.
Abby.
My name is Abby.
Oh, Abby.
Well, that changes everything.
- I'll buy it.
- No, I haven't decided if I want it yet.
Thirty seconds.
Why is that so hard?
-  -  Oh!
Maybe I just don't feel like following all the rules today, okay, Bunchen?
Okay, wow.
Abb Hey, Abby That's fine, Abby.
You take all the time you need.
Thank you.
You were right.
I do like it here.
Good.
Brand-new.
It has speed chill technology.
So you can place a warm pot inside without worrying about increasing the entire internal temperature.
And I've been assured that the rooster will no longer be a problem.
- Thank you so much.
Bye.
- Thanks again.
We'll get your offer in right away.
- We did it!
We got an offer!
- We got an offer!
And you ate, right?
- And it's a good offer, too.
- Yeah, it's great.
And you ate, right?
I'm so excited!
We should jump up and down.
Maybe make it our new thing whenever we get an offer.
So you ate the rooster, right?
Because I also want to jump up and down.
Then you should do it!
Ohh!
We sold a house!
And we can raise chickens, or maybe a lamb, if we don't get emotionally attached.
- What?
-  I couldn't eat the rooster.
But I jumped.
I'm sorry.
I wanted you to be happy, even for a minute.
But it was alive, like Gary.
Yeah, but Gary tasted so good.
- Again, tiny balls.
- We can't kill people, Sheila.
I know.
What if I just ate pieces of people, and then we let them go?
No, that's worse.
- Come with me.
- Where?
I'm taking you to dinner.
- This place is creepy.
- Yeah, well, so are we.
Yeah?
I'm just gonna give you $100, and that's just for opening the door.
- This is my wife.
- Hello.
We need a body.
You gonna fuck it?
Yes, we're gonna fuck it.
All night long.
So what would that cost?
We'd want to take it with us, of course, because we're shy.
Well, you know, it's gonna cost extra 'cause there's two of you.
That seems arbitrary.
If you're renting a car, you don't pay per person.
You do if both people are fucking it.
- Just tell us how much.
- Five grand.
Cash.
- Five grand.
Jesus!
- You got an expensive hobby, lover boy.
What can we get for another $400?
And a Starbucks card.
Yum!
Looks good.
Ohh    I can't.
The meat's too old or something.
Come on, sweetie.
It's the most expensive meal I ever bought you.
-  It smells like chemicals.
- Please eat the foot.
- I can't.
- Please, eat it.
Eat the foot!
Eat the foot!
Eat the goddamn foot!
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's been a stressful 24 hours.
- Why is this happening to me?
- I don't know.
Do you think it could be those clams I had at Japopo's?
I don't know.
We shouldn't go back there anyway.
The food's never been great.
I miss food.
Like, I'm seriously hungry.
We're gonna kill people, sweetheart.
We're gonna kill people so you can eat them.
You don't have to do it with me, honey.
We've been Joel and Sheila since high school.
I'm not gonna bail on you now.
So who do we kill?
-  -  -  Hey, sweetie.
-  Are you okay, honey?
What's up?
Things aren't ever going to be normal again, are they?
- Of course they are.
- It's just a few little changes.
Like the car.
Did we tell you we're keeping the car?
That's gonna be a great change.
We were at the table By the window with the view Casting shadows The sun was pushing through Spoke a lot of words I don't know if I spoke the truth Got so much to lose Got so much to prove God, don't let me lose My mind Trouble on my left Trouble on my right I've been facing trouble almost all my life My sweet love Won't you pull me through Everywhere I look I catch a glimpse of you I said it was love And I did it for life Did-did it for you  Got so much to lose God, don't let me lose My mind
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
I'm worried about Abby crawling in bed with us last night.
She hasn't done that since she was eight.
She must be having trouble coping.
God, there's so many ways to mess up your children.
At least we didn't over-praise her, right?
Honey?
We have to kill somebody today so you can eat them, sweetheart.
I'm worried about Abby, too, but I can't stop thinking about the murdering and eating thing.
I know we have to kill somebody today but we have to be parents every day.
God, I'm so hungry.
I haven't eaten in two days.
- I know.
- How's that omelet, sweetie?
Good?
Yeah, I'm trying this new thing with the sundried tomat Oh, I'm sorry.
Just swallow what's in your mouth.
Do you remember that dinner we had in Tuscany?
On the terrace, outside the castle.
I keep thinking about how good that waiter would taste right now.
Running late.
I'll grab something at Starbucks.
Wait a second, sweetie.
I know there's been a lot of changes in the last couple days but one thing hasn't.
Your father and I are here for you if you ever need to talk.
I have an idea.
Starting tonight, we should have regular family dinners.
Tell each other what's on our mind.
No judgments.
Like the kind I see in your face right now.
Sounds awesome.
So what, or should I say who, are we eating tonight?
Whom.
And as I've told you, from now on I'll only be eating raw chicken and beef.
And we'll be having a side dish of "How's Abby doing"?
And maybe some Spanish rice.
You really wanna know how Abby's doing?
Abby doesn't like that her parents are all up in her B. Your butt?
No!
God!
My business!
Oh.
Okay, well, have a good day at schoo I feel bad lying to her but I don't want Abby to know her parents are going to be killing people.
Yeah, she thinks so little of us already.
So, I was thinking: if we're gonna do this, we have to do it right.
We can't just kill anybody.
We have to kill someone who won't be missed.
- Someone without a family.
- Right.
- And someone bad who deserves it.
- Ooh, yeah, like who?
I don't know.
I guess the prototype would be a young, single Hitler.
Oh, God.
We'd be heroes.
And when we do find someone, we have to be prepared.
- No more impulse killing, it's too risky.
- Totally.
We have to get tarps, gloves, mops, sponges, bleach to clean up the blood All the blood.
So much blood.
Blood everywhere.
- Hon?
- Yeah?
You don't have to go with me.
I'm not sending you out to do this alone, sweetheart.
We're doing it together.
Aww.
But I'll do the actual killing, okay?
So you don't have to worry about that.
Yay.
I am so glad this is not one of those diseases that dries your skin out.
Yeah, that'd be the worst.
What if we kill that dentist who got that woman pregnant while she was having her wisdom teeth out?
- I think that was just a Lifetime movie.
- Oh, yeah, those are fun.
Hey, what about that shitty woman in my yoga class?
- Doesn't she have kids?
- Yeah, but they're shitty, too.
I'm sorry, it's the hunger talking.
Man, where are all the young, single Hitlers?
Speaking of Hitler, your mom called.
She says she has a friend that might have a listing for us.
Was it Joan?
She has that amazing four-bedroom on Blue Ridge.
By the way, your mom's not so easy either.
That's the house.
Swimmer's pool, chef's kitchen, and at least my mom doesn't ask me every week why we only had one kid.
Can we get back to killing people?
I feel like that's a less loaded subject.
- You know how fast you were going?
- What?
- Cop humor.
Went over your head, Joel.
- Ah.
Just wondering, what kind of spray are you using on those ants of yours?
What kind of ant spray?
You told me you were spraying ants in the middle of the night.
- Now I wanna know what you were using.
- Why do you do this, Dan?
I'm just asking my neighbor a friendly question.
Well, Joel?
I don't know.
Ants Away, Ants Be Gone, Fuck You, Ants.
Fuck You, Ants.
You people need to take this more seriously.
You never want a sloppy kill.
You leave anything behind, it's gonna come back and bite you in the ass.
Joel, Sheila.
- I'm telling you, he's onto us.
- We don't know that.
Who talks about ants with that much intensity and innuendo?
Maybe he's just obsessed with them.
Did you know that ants can carry up to 50 times their weight?
They're not uninteresting creatures, Joel.
We should buy some other stuff so we don't look suspicious.
Suspicious that we're cleaning our house?
We also need taco shells for Taco Tuesday.
Which gets so messy.
I feel bad that I wasted so much of Gary.
We recycle, we compost, and yet I threw away 150 pounds of meat.
You ate much as you could, honey.
Even Gary wouldn't have expected you to finish him.
Oh.
Flash-frozen seafood.
That looks good to you?
We never tried to feed you a fish.
We're gonna have to work on how you talk about me.
No.
Frozen is the closest thing to fresh.
What if we got a meat freezer and put it in the storage unit and when we kill somebody, we can just chisel off chunks of it when I need to eat.
No more waste.
Wow.
There's gonna be chiseling.
Sweetie, I can do this on my own.
No, I'm going with you.
I'm fine.
Oh, Jesus.
Hey, I was thinking, uh, maybe instead of ditching again today, we could go to class as an act of rebellion?
Like the sit-ins of the Civil Rights Movement.
Except we'll be sitting at desks and have no real moral imperative.
After everything that's happened the last couple of days, school's too boring.
I want to do something exciting.
- Janie Lewis ran across the freeway.
- So that's out.
Oh, my stepdad has a bunch of intense riot gear in the garage.
Sometimes my friend Jackson and I will put on the body armor and just hit each other with sticks hard.
You can barely feel it.
Even in the balls.
So - I don't want to do that.
- It's not for everyone.
- Hey, Six Minute Abs.
Robot Guy.
- Oh, it's Eric.
It's okay.
Hi, Sarah Elizabeth Newton.
What are you doing here?
You don't ditch school.
- Just trying shit out.
- I love that for you.
I once bought a ferret.
I mean, if we're all talking about trying shit out, I bought a ferret.
Okay, are you ditching today, too?
Do you wanna hang out?
Oh, no, I can't.
I'm seeing Cole.
Look what he got me for our three-month anniversary.
God, he's such a sweet boy.
He's not a boy, Sarah.
I mean, he's a 26-year-old drug dealer who drives a car that says, "Ask me about my tiny dick".
Yo, Sarah.
Don't be jealous.
I just have an exciting life.
And by the way, it is a perfect starter dick.
I love you, okay?
I'll call you tonight.
Yeah, I don't have an exciting life at all.
I mean, I just have an undead mom and we buried a half-eaten corpse in the desert.
Your mom really raised the bar.
I just wish I could think of something super fun to do.
Mmm.
- Do you like games that test your?
- No.
Yeah, me neither.
It's okay, it's not your job to make me happy.
Sounds like it was and I just got fired.
He broke up with me.
He didn't even get out of his car and he took my quesadilla.
- He drive-thru dumped me.
- That jerk.
I'm sorry, Sarah.
- You can have one of my taquitos.
- I don't want a taquito.
That middle-aged fuck boy.
And I left my blue sweater at his house.
The one I got you for your birthday?
I love that sweater.
- I love that sweater.
- Men are such assholes.
I wanna get back at him.
That's something we could do today.
Go after a drug dealer?
That sounds a little dangerous.
I know, right?
Yeah, for sure, we should lean into that.
Well, we bought a freezer to keep bodies in, so that's done.
All we need now is someone who's evil, deserving, won't be missed, and is under 18 cubic feet.
We're not killing my mother.
I wasn't suggesting that, but it's so interesting that's where your mind went.
My stomach's growling.
Hey, Rick.
Hi, Rick.
Hey.
Sorry.
I was listening to a cooking podcast.
Very relaxing.
Did you know, broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts are all from the same family?
Awesome.
So you're a cop.
Are there any criminals who live in this neighborhood?
You know, real animals, society's waste, people so bad that they live alone.
The reason we ask is 'cause we have some clients who want to know about crime and specifically where bad people live.
- Well, this neighborhood's pretty good.
- Oh.
But a pedophile just moved in down the street.
- Oh?
- Mm-hmm.
A pedophile's perfect.
Yeah, perfect.
That's just what we need, right?
At least your kid is 16 and past her prime.
I got a six-month-old.
I'm not saying your daughter's not desirable.
I'm just saying she's not toddler hot.
To a pedophile.
That's how they talk.
So, what's this guy look like?
About 35, Italian, beefy.
So this beefy Italian, walking distance?
Don't worry about it.
All pedophiles are on the registry.
Very closely monitored.
- Really?
- Yeah, sick bastards.
They can't even buy a bottle of lotion without us knowing about it.
Oh, look, Mr. Bumblebee found my rosemary.
Just remember there are no bad ideas in spitballing.
What if I eat Rick?
I think there might be bad ideas in spitballing.
You can't eat our neighbor.
Oh, he's knee-deep in his herb garden, the man is seasoning himself.
I need food.
I'm losing my mind.
Why is it so hard to find someone to kill?
Every time I get coffee, there's some dipshit yelling at the barista.
Maybe I get back at Cole by sending a dozen pizzas to his house.
No, we have to think bigger than that.
- We need something epic, unforgettable.
- Yet proportionate.
Screw proportionate.
Shh, Abby's home.
I mean, we're talking about a guy who is literally the worst person ever.
- "Worst person ever".
- I'm interested.
The man is a monster.
Yeah, he's 26 and has sex with underage girls.
Ooh, I like the sound of that.
- Plus, he sells drugs to kids.
- He sells drugs to kids.
Ahh-cha!
I swear, I had no idea about that when we started dating.
His Instagram is KidWeed.
I thought that was ironic.
Excuse me, waiter?
I'll have that.
Did you know, in three weeks we'll have had this listing for a year?
It's not our fault.
It's priced too high, the seller won't come down, and there's about to be a murder in here.
Hey, if you can, try to keep it contained.
Not to be critical, honey, but Gary looked like he swallowed some TNT.
It's no worse than what you did to the turkey on Thanksgiving.
- We need new knives.
- So buy some.
They're expensive and they just get dull.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
You know, we have a gift certificate to Williams-Sonoma.
- Cole!
- So glad you made it.
- It's good to meet you.
- Great to meet you.
Why are you guys dressed like that?
Are you, like, coloring each other's hair or something?
No, but that would've been a good explanation.
Actually, we're real estate brokers who have been having trouble selling this place.
Eager to make it more appealing, we're repainting the kitchen.
Get in here.
Okay.
- We should act more normal.
- I'm doing the best I can.
Can I get you a water drink, Cole?
Actually, I had a couple beers on the drive over, so I'm good.
You guys couldn't have picked a better place to make a buy.
An empty house at the end of the street, it's like, "Hey, there's a drug deal going down in here"!
Oh, wait, nobody can hear me yelling!
We'll see.
You guys ordered a half ounce of Skywalker OG Kush, - which is an excellent choice, by the way.
- Oh, my God, this is really happening.
Oh, relax, bro, you're just buying weed.
Oh, my God, it's Joan.
It might be about that listing on Blue Ridge.
I gotta take this.
- Really?
- It has a swimmer's pool.
Business.
- She shan't be long.
- Shan't?
I'm doing the best I can.
Do we have to wait for her?
Absolutely.
She has the money.
Yeah.
Well Man, I had a shitty day today.
This girl I've been seeing, told me she was 21, turned out to be 16.
Obviously, I had to break it off with her, mmm.
- You had no idea?
- No.
What kills me is I actually I kinda liked her.
Maybe we shouldn't talk.
- Why not?
- It saddens me.
Mind if I smoke a little weed while we wait?
So selling drugs to kids, that seems pretty fucked up.
Well, it wasn't part of the plan, dude.
You know?
I mean, I started selling pot in high school.
I grew up, I tried to get out of it and my dumb sister gets a divorce so I end up having to help her out.
Sometimes you do shit you never expected for the people you love.
That is so true.
I know, but then I look at you and I think you got a great career.
You got a great wife.
It's like, "How do I get my face in front of a house, on a sweet sign next to a sweet lady like that"?
It's easy.
First, you're a high school quarterback and prom king - and you date the prom queen.
- Mm.
After school you think you're pretty hot shit, so you coast for a while.
Try music.
You're a decent guitar player, not great.
So you take a few classes in hotel management.
Try improv.
But your object work is never what you want it to be.
What's What's object work?
It's like making a fucking sandwich, only it's not really there.
- Oh.
It's like being a mime?
- No.
Because you can talk about the sandwich, which is also bad improv.
Anyway, by this point, I'm married, we have a kid, it's time to get serious.
My wife is a realtor.
I wake up one day and so am I. I'm not complaining.
I work my own hours, I only see my boss twice a week.
It's just not where I saw my life going.
- Wow, man, that's just - And now Jesus Christ, if I told you the crazy shit happening, you'd put me in an asylum.
It's like my life is spiraling toward disaster and there's no way out.
The worst part is, I can't even talk about it with the person I love the most because she'll blame herself, and that's not what I want.
Come on, come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Yeah.
You're not gonna die today.
Okay.
Sorry, everyone.
So rude.
Where's Cole?
- I told him to go.
- What?
He's an okay guy and a really good listener.
He doesn't deserve to die in an overpriced Spanish revival.
I leave you for five fucking minutes and you bond with my dinner?
- We had a lot in common.
- Yeah, you're both high.
You know, I gotta say, sometimes your pot smoking bugs me.
Well, I don't like that you're gonna be killing and eating people, so we both have things that bug us.
And by the way, they're legalizing my thing.
All I know is that if you hadn't fired up a fatty with your drug dealing, statutory rapist friend, I'd have eaten by now.
He didn't know Sarah was 16.
And he's helping his divorced sister.
First of all, every creep who dated a teenager "didn't know," okay?
And if we are playing Family Feud and the category was reasons to sell drugs to kids, my sister's divorce wouldn't even be up on the board.
Your stepdad may be a dick, but he has really cool toys.
Finally, his right wing paranoia pays off.
Are you sure this isn't too crazy?
Yeah, maybe he didn't know how old she was.
What did he think she was doing every day between 8:00 and 3:30?
At the high school, where he picked her up.
Okay, I'm in.
Ahh, smoke!
No, my eyes are burning!
My throat is burning!
Ah, it stings.
Why is this happening?
Where is my hose?
I can't believe we did this.
Let's get out of here.
- I could leave.
- Not yet.
There it is, yes oh, God, no!
Where is it?
I need it.
What is she doing?
Here's your sweater.
It was not your job to make me happy today.
But if it was, you'd be rehired.
Six Minute Fucking Abs.
I don't know how much longer I can go without food.
We'll get you the Italian pedophile.
We'll just take the risk.
What if you find out he's supporting his sister and you have to become besties?
I don't wanna fight with you, honey.
That guy's pot was really good.
Thank goodness for that.
I was worried you weren't high enough.
Very funny.
Ooh!
In-N-Out, that'd be excellent.
If we were eating.
Ooh!
- Goddamn it!
- Shit.
Yeah, shit.
I agree.
Pull over!
Follow me!
Christ.
Sorry, buddy, I don't know how that happened.
That's a $10,000 job right there, fuck jar!
That doesn't seem true.
And "fuck jar"?
What's that?
- It's a jar full of fuck, you fucker.
- Jesus.
You blind?
How could you not see me, asshole?
- Aaah!
- Oh, God!
Are you sure you want your last words to be "me, asshole"?
You bitch.
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit!
What did I do?
I couldn't control it.
And the street's right there, what if somebody sees us?
What are we gonna do?
Okay, there's nobody around, it's dark, and there are no security cameras.
We'll wrap his body in a tarp, put it in our car, take it to the storage unit where you can eat.
I'll mop up the blood and pour some bleach on the spot so it doesn't stain.
We haven't touched his car, so we'll leave it here.
You understand?
I understand it's super sexy when you take control.
- Sheila?
- Right, put a pin in it.
Man, this guy really hit the spot.
I just stuffed a man in a meat freezer.
Cross that off my bucket list.
This part right here is the human fillet.
The more you know.
Porsche guy was from Nevada.
He owned a strip club and a waste management company.
Oh, nothing sketchy there.
- Any family photos?
- Nope.
I found pictures of a few women but they were taken from inside a toilet, so probably not serious relationships.
Maybe he won't be missed.
What a night.
We're gonna be okay.
- I love you, Joel, so much.
- I love you too.
23 years and you still find a way to keep life exciting.
- We have our family dinner tonight.
- We can't go home to Abby like this.
Don't we have old clothes in some of those boxes?
Mmm.
- How was your day?
- Good.
Yours?
Good.
- Did anything interesting happen?
- Not really.
You?
- No.
- What are you eating?
Raw beef.
How's your shrimp?
- Oh.
Good.
- You know why?
Because it's flash frozen, and that's what keeps it so pink and fresh.
Oh, I forgot, Joan is going to give us that listing.
- Honey?
- Are you okay, Dad?
Yeah, I'm good.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1 -  - Good morning, good morning It's great to stay up late Good morning, good morning to you When the band began to play The moon was shining bright Now the milkman's on his way It's too late to say goodnight - So good morning, good morning - Mmm.
- Sunbeams will soon smile through - Mmm, mmm.
Good morning, good morning to you And you and you and you - Good morning, good morning -  We've gabbed the whole night through Good morning Good morning to you Nothin' could be finer Than to sleep off all that wine, oh!
- In the morning - In the morning It's great to stay up late - Another morning - Good morning to you Might've been more frisky If we hadn't had that whiskey When we left the bar last night Our future looked so bright Now comes the dawn And work is calling I just want to say goodnight And now it's morning Good morning - Good morning to you -  Mmm!
What a beautiful day!
I love walking with you guys.
Friends, fresh air, sunshine.
Look how hard you're working.
Everyone's rooting for you!
- You're so happy.
Why?
- Why would anybody not be happy?
What if someone has a baby, and while they love him, or her, or them, if it's twins - We know you mean you.
- I just miss going out, having a life.
John Legend's touring, and I wanna see him four times.
- So do it.
- I can't.
Every time I go out, RJ makes this face like, "Mommy, aren't I enough"?
Ugh, babies are the worst.
The trick is to not say goodbye to them.
Alondra, you need to put on a crop top, go to a concert and shake those boobs for someone who doesn't just see them as dinner.
Congratulations on your boobs, by the way.
They are amazing.
When I stopped breastfeeding, mine turned into Russian nesting dolls.
This one could fit in that one.
Oh, come on, your body is ridiculous in those tight leggings and that sweet ass.
Dan is lucky to hit that shit.
Yeah, but it's how he hits it.
The man is tense.
The last time we had sex, I swear to God, he didn't blink.
I clapped right in his face, nothing.
It's like fucking a British guard.
You two should be having more fun.
Live your best lives.
Give it the full Oprah!
Sheila, you have really changed in the last few days.
You used to be kind of bland, no offense.
And kinda uptight, no offense.
- We did stuff without you all the time.
- No offense.
Hey, Eric has a science thing at school tonight.
Will you come?
It'll be so much less boring than going with just Alondra.
No offense?
Of course I'll come.
And I'll bring Joel and Abby.
We love Eric.
I wanted to adopt Eric, but Joel said no.
Seriously, what's going on with you?
It's probably my new diet.
I've been eating a lot of protein.
- Really?
- How many grams?
All of them.
Good morning to you Come on!
-  - Good morning To you May I help you?
Yes.
Good morning.
I've been hired to do a documentary for the National Geographic Channel.
It's an historical look at the undead and a very legitimate project.
Eager to make it accurate, I've been visiting paranormal bookstores looking for materials on outbreaks and possible remedies.
You'll find the zombie literature in our lifestyle section, next to the fertility crystals.
If you hit witch balls, you've gone too far.
Isn't that always the case?
Anything you can use?
I don't think so.
I'm looking for something more real, less for kids.
I do have one thing in the back, but I don't show it to a lot of people.
Yeah?
What is it?
Zombie porn.
Thank you for your time.
Oh, my God.
- Hey, Rick!
- Hey, Joel.
Can you pop your trunk for me?
Those are words you never wanna hear from a cop.
Come on, I want to check the cargo space.
See, I love my bike, but the only thing it holds is ass.
By the way, you gotta try that thing.
Zero to 60 in one-point-fuck seconds.
- Oh!
-  Hi, honey!
Where'd you go this morning?
What's in the bag?
Is it a present?
Is it for me?
Is it for me?
Plain white bag.
Nasty.
Hey, babe.
I changed his diaper, put on his socks.
Great dad alert.
Come on, you.
Let's go listen to some John Legend, take your socks off, 'cause it's 100 degrees.
I gotta get ready for work.
I gotta drive out to Riverside today.
Might as well be Mars, except it's hotter, there's less air, food's not as good, less culture, and it's further from my house.
Fuck me.
So let's take a look.
Yes.
Let's.
Oh, my.
That is roomy.
Rick, look at me, look at me.
Look at me.
What?
I can make my hips go side to side now.
- I could never do this before.
- Why would you want to?
Because it's a turn-on, Rick.
Yeah, I see it.
So what's a car like this set you back?
It doesn't set you back, Rick, it launches you forward.
If you want one, you should get one.
Don't overthink it.
Overthinking is a boner killer.
- Hit the deck, we got a shooter!
-  - What the hell, Dan?
-  Just testing your reflexes, Officer Puss.
Not so bueno.
When Santa Monica PD hears "shooter," they think "oyster bar".
That's 'cause we can afford oysters, since we make a shit-ton more money than a sheriff's deputy.
Boom!
Hmm?
Thanks, guys.
Here, I got you ant spray.
- That's okay, I have ant spray.
- You don't know what you have.
I need you to kill those little bastards before they start making their way into my yard.
I found one in my kitchen this morning.
Now if I get an ant problem because you have an ant problem, you and I are gonna have a problem.
- What is she doing, Joel?
- I don't know, Dan.
Just spray your yard.
See?
He doesn't think we killed Gary, he's just obsessed with ants.
Yeah, that's a relief, and in some ways even more troubling.
Come on, I want to show you something.
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.
He's throwing up a ball thing, like I did.
I know.
I've been going to all these occult bookstores.
The woman where I found these said they're copies of prints from 16th century Serbia.
Then we need to find somebody who speaks Serbian.
Yeah, in Santa Clarita, which just got its first Indian restaurant.
I wonder what it says.
Jesus, I hate that ringtone.
- Clients like it.
It's funny.
- We disagree on that.
Uh-oh.
It's Abby's school.
Your daughter walked out of class three days ago and she hasn't been back since.
- We had no idea Abby was skipping school.
-  She's never done it before, or at least she's never been caught.
Not a great sportswoman either.
Is anything unusual happening at home?
- Um, unusual - Unusual Unusual - No.
All good.
- Unusual?
Very usual.
The reason I'm taking this so seriously is because it's not just about Abby.
She's also having a corrupting influence on Eric Bemis.
And  Eric Bemis is a remarkable young man, so Are you saying that Abby Hammond isn't remarkable?
I'm sure that's not what he's saying.
It'd be great if that's not what you're saying.
Eric Bemis has a 4.5 GPA.
The only Bs he ever got are the ones he raised to study colony collapse disorder.
That's something that happens to bees.
Based on her biology grades, I guess Abby may not have known that either.
Well, now it feels like you're calling our daughter stupid.
And us.
Again, I'm sure that's not what he's saying.
It'd be great if that's not what you're saying.
Yes, it would be.
Let's keep this simple.
If your daughter misses school again, she's going to be suspended.
Suspended?
If Abby is going through some typical teenage problem that happens to any typical family like ours, instead of punishing her you should show her some compassion.
And you shouldn't tell me how to do my job.
Well, maybe if you did it right, then all the parents wouldn't talk about you - like you are a steaming pile of - Here's a solution.
Let's all stop talking until I can think of what to say next.
Okay, we'll speak to our daughter and make sure she never misses school again.
Good.
Because if she does - Please don't say it.
- miss school again - She won't.
- she's going to be - Don't say it.
- I wouldn't say it.
- suspended.
- Okay.
- Goddamn it.
- We're all on the same page.
Honey, shall we?
I have a small refrigerated space I would love to introduce you to.
I think you would look really good in it.
- What?
- Tiny wine room.
We're selling a house with a tiny wine room.
Let us know if you're interested.
-  -  - Jesus Christ.
- I don't care for him.
He's the principal!
You can't eat the school -  - How's it going?
All right.
Principal.
We got lucky last night with that guy you killed in the parking lot.
But people have seen us here.
We signed in.
If his next appointment walked into a bloodbath, they might have tied it to his previous one.
Relax!
I didn't eat him yet.
No, no, no.
You won't eat him, ever.
- Fine.
Ever yet.
- Honey.
The more impulsive you are, the more likely we'll get caught.
And if we get caught, our lives together will be over, forever.
Do you understand?
Yes.
I understand.
I can't be impulsive and kill the wrong person, like that bastard in there who didn't have any family pictures and probably doesn't have any friends, but did have sneakers with reflective strips in his office, so may run alone at night.
Thank you for hearing me.
So we just got called into the principal's office.
Why?
What'd you do?
What?
That was funny!
- She's a remarkable girl.
- I know she's remarkable.
- So then we're done?
-  No.
It's because you're remarkable that we expect more of you.
It all just seems so meaningless.
Seriously, trigonometry?
- What does that matter?
- Trigonometry matters a lot.
There are triangles in everything.
Pizza.
Triangles.
Not the shape, the musical instrument.
- Honey, anything you want to add?
- Sure.
If Abby doesn't want to go to school, she shouldn't go.
- What?
- Wait, you're serious?
As a triangle.
She's not gonna use half the stuff they teach in there and you never cared about trigonometry.
The only triangle you were interested in was the one in my pants.
- Mom!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.
Follow your heart.
Listen, you like writing poetry?
Maybe do that.
You're saying I should drop out of school and be a poet?
- No, no, no.
No one's saying that.
- That's exactly what I'm saying.
- Live your best life.
- What's happening right now?
What's happening is you're grounded.
So go to your room.
Thank you.
No, that I understand.
- You can't keep being like this.
- You mean, being who I am?
I know you want to do whatever you want now, but I'm not sure the family can survive it.
- Hello?
-  Mrs. Hammond, what are you doing here?
Would you like a Triscuit?
Your front door was unlocked, and no, thank you.
Listen, I need to talk to someone, and you are the closest thing to an expert I know.
Thank you.
Please, sit.
This morning, I felt really great.
I was encouraging everyone to be their best selves, but just now, I told Abby to drop out of school.
And before that, I almost killed Principal Novak.
Yes, uh, impulse control.
The undead do not have it.
I gotta do something, because I can't be like -  -  - Oh, uh sorry.
- It's okay.
No pee, so, that's a win.
Do you think it's possible for me to have any control?
We can't ignore a fundamental truth.
The undead are completely driven by their id.
But if I can't control myself, then I risk everything that matters to me.
You can't change your nature.
- But I have to.
- Then maybe you can.
- Do you think?
- No.
- But I could lose my family.
- Then you have to change.
- But you just said I can't.
- You can't.
- But you're saying I have to.
- You do.
You're saying that I need to change my nature, but that's impossible.
Yeah.
Uh, on the other hand, maybe nothing's impossible.
Who would've ever thought an octopus and a kitten could fall in love?
It's on YouTube, you gotta see it.
It'll give you hope.
No.
Wait.
Oh, I'm sorry, did you want one?
You know, I used to ditch.
My home life was also a little challenging.
Really?
Did Grandma Jenny eat half a man and bury the rest of him in the desert?
No.
But she once made a produce guy cry over a head of lettuce, and that was her public persona.
How'd you deal?
Collected baseball cards, painted pine cones.
Sometimes I went into the woods and yelled at birds.
You yelled at birds?
We didn't have money for a therapist and yelling at people was Grandma Jenny's thing.
Then when I got older What?
What?
-  -  Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
That was sick!
I got a bike when I was 16 and never yelled at a bird again.
I can see why.
- Was yours as cool as Rick's?
- It was pretty sweet.
'83 Triumph Daytona.
- Do you still have it?
- Yeah, I keep it in the storage unit - Oh, my God, I want to see it.
- Nah.
Now it's just a pile of rusted crap.
Check out this view.
I used to bring your mom up here when we were in high school.
Carved our initials in that picnic bench.
Back then it was all just open space.
Man, things change.
Can Mom still love?
- What?
Of course she can.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- That's a weird smile.
- I'm freaking out, man!
- I'm freaking out too!
- It's so weird!
- So fucking weird!
Last week, she organized our pasta by cooking times, and wouldn't let me eat crackers in the living room.
Tuesday, she strangled a rooster!
Two weeks ago, she was making me vocab cards for the SATs.
Now she doesn't care if I go to school anymore.
- I know!
What the hell's happening?
- I know!
I mean, like, did Mom die when Mom died?
I wish I had more answers, honey.
I know things may have changed from when you were here in high school but it's still beautiful.
Yeah, it is.
Come on, your mom's waiting for us at that science fair.
Wait.
Where'd you carve your initials?
There it is.
Aww.
That's sweet.
It's been here over 20 years.
Of course, the artwork around it is new.
Nice to meet you.
One day he'll build a woman out of soft materials and never come out of his room.
You haven't touched your margarita.
Wow.
That's a lot of tequila.
Mmm.
Ever since I discovered this little trick I have been, like, the best mom.
Plus I'm pregaming for a work thing later.
- Tonight?
- Oh, yeah.
Pharmaceutical rep hours are super flexible.
That's why so many of us have time to go on The Bachelor.
Oh.
No.
Ugh.
Look at him, the king of nothing.
-  - "Yes, welcome to my land.
I am great.
I am a sex tourist, traveling the world over.
Paying handsomely for sex".
"Oh, I am currently farting".
Whoa.
Hi!
You dickless bore.
- Eric is quite the star, hmm?
-  Yeah.
I don't know where he gets it.
His father was so dumb.
I mean, crush a mouse dumb.
- Oh.
My.
- Mm.
- Mrs. Hammond.
- Principal Novak.
I am sorry that things went awry this morning.
Thank you.
Apology accepted.
- I wasn't actually apologizing.
- You just said you were sorry.
I'm sorry about the situation, which you instigated.
Isn't there a potato clock somewhere that needs your attention?
You should be grateful that I didn't suspend Abby.
In fact, I still might.
It all depends on what you say next, madame.
Fine, I'm sorry.
- You farting sex tourist.
- Oh, snap.
Tell Abby don't bother coming to school tomorrow.
What a cuntstick.
- Hold this?
- Yeah.
- Sheila!
-  Joel!
Hi, you're here.
Where's Abby?
She needed to swing by her locker.
I need to tell you something.
- Yes?
- I love you.
I have loved you since we carved our initials in that picnic bench.
I've loved you for the 19 years we've been married, and I'll love you for however long we have together.
So you be whoever you need to be.
Just because something's changed doesn't mean it's not still beautiful.
That's exactly what I needed to hear.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Novak.
- Dad?
- Abby, go back.
Let's keep this simple.
Abby's going through a really hard time right now so you're not going to suspend her, because if you do I will make your life miserable.
I can sell your home, I can fuck up your Zillow estimate.
I can rezone your neighborhood for horses.
I have a notary that will do anything for me.
I am a realtor and I can destroy you.
It'll all depend on what you say next.
Tell Abby I'll see her at school tomorrow.
Okay, then.
You have a lovely evening.
- Wow, you were intense.
-  Well, yeah, you're my baby.
All right, let's go check out Eric's action.
Why didn't you kill Novak?
Not that I'm complaining.
You told me to be who I needed to be, and that's someone who doesn't want to lose her family.
- Come on, honey, we're gonna be late.
- Oh, my God.
- Principal Novak, wait.
- Leave me alone.
- Are you Serbian?
- Leave me alone.
I saw the flag in your window.
It's Serbian.
- I saw it in my research.
- Let go.
- Do you speak Serbian?
- You people are insane.
- Do you speak Serbian?
- No, but my grandmother does.
You better let me go because I live with her and if I'm not home by 8:00 I'm a grown man and I can do whatever I want.
Still, I'm leaving.
-  -  I need to meet your grandmother!
How's it going?
All right.
Hey, girl.
Remember that work opportunity I told you about last night?
- I closed the deal.
- Ooh, awesome.
Big sale?
Sale?
No, no.
The opportunity was to bone an oncologist.
- What?
- Yeah.
We've been flirting for weeks, and you inspired me.
"Live your best life," right?
- Thank you.
- Well The clients are running 15 minutes late, so no rush.
-  -  It's just three weekends in February.
You can't just pick up and follow John Legend on tour.
But this could be my last chance.
Now that he and Chrissy have the baby, John wants to be home with his family.
He's such a good dad.
You don't do something like this without us talking about it.
- Hey, good news, Rick.
- Oh, shit.
-  - Your Range Rover came in early.
- Just need a signature.
- Did you buy a new car?
Maybe let's get to the house early.
Okay.
This is all you, right?
They're grown-ups.
They can make their own decisions.
- What did you tell him?
- Just drive, honey.
You know, these are our neighbors.
We have to maintain relationships Oh, Christ, there's Dan.
- Hey, Joel!
-  The sprayer I gave you is still on your porch!
Spray your goddamn ants!
Lazy sons of bitches.
I take care of this whole neighborhood.
Whoa.
I wish I was a little bit taller I wish I was a baller I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her I wish I had a rabbit in a hat With a bat and a 64 Impala I wish I had a brand new car So far I got this hatchback And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at And when I'm in my car I'm laid back I got an 8-track and a spare tire In the backseat, but that's flat And do you wanna know What's really whack?
See, I can't even get a date So what you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night With a hood rat you can hold tight But really, though, I'm Figaro Within my car I can't even get a hello Well, so many people Wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday One day I'm gonna have to Get in my car and go You know I take the 110 to the 105 Get off on Crenshaw Tell my homies "Look alive" 'Cause it's hard to survive When you're livin' in a concrete jungle And these girls keep passin' me by She looks fly, she looks fly Make me say "My, my, my" I wish I was a little bit taller I wish I was a baller I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her I wish I had a rabbit in a hat With a bat and a 64 Impala I wish I was a little bit taller I wish I was a baller I wish I had a girl who looked good I would call her I wish I had a rabbit in a hat With a bat and a 64 Impala - I wish I was a little bit taller - Wish I was a little bit taller - I wish I was a baller - Wish I was a baller - Wish I was a little bit taller, y'all - Wish I was a little bit taller, y'all I wish I was a baller I wish I wish I wish I wish
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1 Hello.
I'm friends with your grandson Principal Novak, and I have something in Serbian I need translated.
- He said you might be able to help me.
- I knows nothing about you.
But I know about you.
And I brought you a reminder from home.
- Paczki.
- Paczki is Polish.
It's for peasants.
Leave outside for birds.
Bring the box.
I use the box.
So I have these prints.
This no good.
Put outside with Polish trash bread.
I need to know what it says.
Please?
I'll bring you another empty box.
It say, "Man eat man, to live".
This is story of village of Pozica.
When I little girl, they tell this story to frighten childrens.
Whole village turn to monster.
Man eat wife.
Mother eat child.
Dead eat life.
My father tell me if I bad he send me to Pozica and they eat my face.
So many different styles of parenting, huh?
I'll say.
So, what does this one mean?
"Without cure, man will die".
Wait, there's a cure?
What is it?
Who knows.
Pictures come from very old book.
- Cure in book, but book very rare.
- Do you have book?
Do you have Mona Lisa?
Somebody threw donuts in the yard.
What are you doing here?
I felt very bad about the tension between you and my wife the other day.
So I brought your grandmother a, uh empty box.
I told you to stay away from me, and now here you are in my house with my baka?
I didn't eat any of them.
- My grandmother!
- Andrei, he nice boy.
I nice boy.
But I leave now.
God, that rhythm really gets in your head.
And once I looked up Pozica, I found this.
It's another image from the same book our prints came from.
I think this one shows someone taking the cure.
- Do you really think there's a cure?
- Mmm.
Yes.
The baka said so.
- Chewbacca?
- No.
The baka.
Baka is "grandmother" in Serbian.
I'm learning so much!
- You seem a little manic, honey.
- Well, I feel really manic.
It's exciting, there could be a cure.
You could be eating pizza in a week.
- Don't you want to be cured?
- Of course I do.
Although, I do like the way that I feel.
I have endless energy, and I sleep two hours a night.
I get so much done.
- You eat people.
- I know.
It's just that I'm so much more confident now.
And our sex is incredible.
And I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but I can parallel park in one move now.
- But you do want to be cured, right?
- Totally.
Mostly.
You eat people.
- I know.
- So we need to find this book.
Well, do we even know the name of it?
It's some long Serbian name, which according to a message board roughly translates to: Pozica: Never Fucking Go There.
There's this guy who claims to have it.
Name's Anton.
He's really big in the paranormal world.
This is the only picture I could find of him.
Oops!
I was looking at a new carving knife for Thanksgiving.
240 bucks.
Big investment.
Still thinking about it.
Here he is.
No last name, no phone number, just an expired e-mail address.
But I am gonna find you, Anton.
And then I'm gonna read your book, you blurry son of a bitch!
We have that open house today.
Maybe you should take the day off, let me cover it.
What?
Huh?
Well, it's just that everything's been so intense lately and I'm worried about you.
Maybe you should take some Joel time.
I can get Abby to help me.
I guess it could give me some time to search for this Anton guy.
No.
Don't do anything, okay?
Just relax.
I'm dead, it can wait until tomorrow.
Okay.
I don't even know if I can relax.
Hey!
Oh, I finally found that blooper reel from - My mom's eating people.
- Spaceballs.
Not realizing your news was that.
I went to the storage unit to look at my dad's old bike, I found half a businessman in the freezer.
Wow.
That must have been intense.
- Are you okay?
- It was pretty weird.
I opened it expecting to find ice cream and instead there was a dead guy with a look on his face like I surprised him.
I'm sorry.
But your mom is undead, so that's kind of how they roll.
I know.
But she told me she was only gonna be eating raw chicken and beef.
They always make this big thing about how we can be honest with each other and now I find out they're lying to me.
Personally, I don't mind when my mom lies to me.
I just wish she did it better.
Check this out.
She claims she started a new spin class but really, she's having an affair with a guy named Bob.
- No way.
- Yeah.
She accidentally linked her cell phone to my computer so I can see all of her texts.
Today, Bob copied and pasted all of the lyrics to Stevie Wonder's "Part Time Lover".
- Which seems lazy and on the nose.
- You should say something to her.
It would only embarrass her.
She's just trying to protect me from knowing she's in a crappy marriage.
Maybe your mom's trying to protect you from knowing that she's a vicious killing machine.
No offense, I think it's kinda cool.
Put it away, I'm coming in!
Oh, Abby, I didn't know you were here.
- Jesus.
Mom.
- Oh, calm down, everybody does it.
Even your own mother.
You guys want some waffles?
Yeah, Abby, my mom masturbated, then made waffles.
- Does that make you hungry?
- No.
I should leave.
I actually have to cover for my dad at an open house, so - Oh, what's wrong with Joel?
- Turn it off, Dan.
- I think he's just taking the day off.
- Interesting.
Really?
Maybe I'm too close to it.
See you, guys.
So you two were alone in your room with the door closed.
- Nothing happened.
- Of course nothing happened.
You're you.
Will you leave him alone, Dan?
He's just waiting for his moment.
Honey, there's a casserole in the fridge.
I'm going to spin class again tonight.
Good for you, Mom.
You have fun on that bike.
No regrets.
I'm gonna go next door, talk to Joel about something.
- Oh, God, not the ants again.
- No.
Not the ants.
Too much time on my hands Too much time on my hands Too much time on my hands Too much time on my - Whoa.
- Yeah.
No, I'm good.
I'm on baby duty.
But you can blow it in my face.
Fuck it, just give it to me.
So I got a cop question for you.
Can you run a search on a guy with just a first name and an expired email address?
- This guy fucking Sheila?
- What?
No.
Why would you say that?
Two reasons people ask a cop to find somebody: wife-fucking, or because they found a wallet and they want to return it.
Which is usually an excuse to find a wife-fucker.
Uh, it's a work thing.
I was at Starbucks and this guy said he wanted to buy a house with a nice yard.
Has two dogs.
One's a little dog who thinks he's a big dog You know what?
I'm too high to lie right now.
- Can you just do it?
- Yeah, I don't give a shit.
Gentlemen.
Whoa, hey!
What the hell?
You can't just walk in my house.
I knocked, no one answered.
Probably couldn't hear me over all this weed.
Marijuana is nice, yes?
I smoky with my black lover, have a sexy time!
What reaction are you hoping for right now?
I thought toking the indo made everything funnier.
Ooh!
Baby's awake.
Gotta go.
Oh, come on, man, don't leave me alone with - out you.
- Let him go.
We don't need him to have fun.
- So, what do you want, Dan?
- You know, Abby was just over.
Her and Eric have become good friends.
- Yeah.
- And you and Rick are good friends.
- Yeah.
- I don't have a lot of friends.
Maybe you just need to meet people with similar interests and I know how friends work, Joel.
Will you be my friend?
Uh No.
Ouch.
That hurt.
I think you should reconsider.
Uh No.
Too bad.
Because if you're not gonna be my friend, then you're fucked.
I killed the fly.
It was a worthy adversary.
Are you baking cookies?
No, it's vanilla extract and essential oils baked in the oven at 350.
It's an old realtor trick.
Makes the house smell like home.
- Why not just bake cookies?
- Because they're messy.
And I happen to believe Americans get enough sugar in their diet.
- But this is a lie.
- It's not a lie, it's a trick.
What's the difference?
One is a sin and one pays for your Spotify.
- What's your problem?
- I wanted an honest cookie, Mom.
And you're giving me a nose full of hypocrisy.
Wha Like you're so perfect.
Who skipped school last week?
Fuck!
That's what I should've said.
Thanks for the sandwich.
That was really good.
Making my balls buzz.
Mmm!
I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out how that finger got in my backyard.
My gardener got some new pruning shears Ah, Joel I know the finger belongs to Gary West.
I ran the print.
I know that you and Sheila worked with Gary.
And I know that Lisa saw Gary dancing with your wife at the club, grinding her pelvis into a fine mist.
And then Gary disappeared.
Fuck!
This is such a drag.
There is one thing I don't know.
How could a pussy like you kill someone?
I mean, I once saw you running after an ice cream truck.
- What do you want, Dan?
- I told you, I just wanna be friends.
Fine, we're friends.
Let's get Slurpees and go to Magic Mountain.
- So, are you gonna arrest me or what?
- Of course not, buddy.
But, hey, now that we are friends, I do need a favor.
I'm gonna be out of town for a few days.
Kind of a hunting/alibi trip.
- Alibi?
- Yeah.
While I'm gone, I'm gonna need you to kill someone for me.
- What?
- I said, "While I'm gone, I'm gonna need you to kill someone for me".
I heard you, Dan.
I just said "what"?
because I was startled.
Oh.
I'm sorry I startled you.
Still gonna need you to kill someone for me.
Imagine coming home after a long day of work to turn on your new Wi-Fi enabled sound system, which you can listen to from every room in the house.
And poof.
You're in your own private sanctuary.
- Sheila!
- I'm in the living room!
We're fucked!
With clients!
Hello.
Pardon my language.
We just have so many bids coming in.
I'm Joel Hammond.
Have you been upstairs to check out the multi-directional spray shower?
- Not yet.
- Well, get up there!
Master bath, upstairs, right up there, there you go.
Lovely.
Dan found one of Gary's fingers in our backyard.
- Oh, my God.
- He thinks you and Gary were having an affair, and I found out and killed him.
So Dan assumes you killed Gary?
That's sexist.
Yes, that's the big problem here, honey.
Dan's devaluing the important contribution women make.
I see the problem, sweetheart.
It's just a little offensive.
We all agree he's a terrible misogynist.
He's also a crooked cop who's blackmailing me to murder someone.
So I don't know where to focus my anger.
He wants you to kill somebody?
Why?
He's some drug dealer who's murdered a bunch of people.
Dan keeps arresting him and he keeps getting off.
So now Dan wants me to be his personal killer.
Shit!
- Abby!
- Abba-dabba-doo!
It's 4:01.
Open house is over.
Let's go home.
Hopefully, there'll be real cookies there.
A couple came in today with the cutest set of twins.
- I love twins.
- A boy and a girl.
That's the best kind.
Honey, would you mind running out and grabbing that sign for us?
Oh, but then I'd miss all the fun twin talk.
Maybe we should just keep driving.
Go home, get some clothes, and just never come back.
Well, that's crazy.
We can't just run away.
Where would we go?
And we have so much equity in our house.
Yeah, I didn't think about the equity.
I'm a monster.
I had a thought.
Maybe we can make this work for us.
You want to murder someone for Dan?
I will need to eat, and this is a bad guy.
I don't want to be Dan's hired assassin.
I'm just settling into being a real estate broker who kills people.
And the only thing I like about that job is I get to be my own boss.
- Hi.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- What's going on?
- Dinner.
We were talking about what to get for dinner.
Your dad wants chicken, I want beef.
Oh, my goodness.
However will it resolve?
Honey, would you mind getting that one for us too?
Yes.
Oh, I see, that wasn't a real question.
Abby's been acting a little weird lately.
Have you noticed?
No, but it's been a busy day.
I went to the gym, I misplaced my cell phone, oh, and then Dan asked me to murder a murderer.
Okay, I get it.
You don't want to do this.
- Thank you.
- Which is why I'm happy to do this myself.
You have been doing so well with your research and your bookstores.
And I've been doing well sneaking up on people and killing them.
We both have our strengths.
What a team.
Wow.
Dan called me a pussy today.
This feels of a piece.
That wasn't what I was saying.
I was just saying I know you don't wanna go with me when I go to shop for dinner, so I'll go by myself.
No.
It's okay.
I don't like this shopping excursion you're proposing, but I can certainly handle it, so I will help you.
Because what kind of man would I be if I sent you to the grocery store alone?
Well, I love you being my shopping partner, so thank you.
Wow.
Your wedding vows must have been awesome.
I can't do it anymore.
I can't just not say anything to my parents when I know they're lying right to my face.
Hello.
I just want to say, "Stop lying!
I know that 'beef' you're shopping for probably once wore underwear".
Am I just supposed to pretend forever I don't know they're killing people?
It's tough.
On one hand, they love you and are trying to protect you, and on the other hand - you smell like coconuts.
- I just think that if you love someone, you have to be completely and totally honest with them.
Like, no matter what.
- Uh-huh.
- I'm just gonna tell them I know because Oh, Eric, uh, I'm I'm sorry - It's okay.
- No, it's just I'm going through a lot right now and I can't really get involved with anyone Abby, I get it.
You're not interested in me.
- That's not what - No, it's fine.
I was just trying to prove my point.
Because you're not into me.
But you just lied to protect me so I wouldn't get hurt, like your parents are doing to you.
And I'm not hurt, because this was all a rhetorical exercise to make a point.
Okay.
No, I see what you're saying about, um Um, yeah.
Cool.
Hey, sorry if I embarrassed you by, like, thinking you actually wanted to kiss me.
Oh, me, embarrassed?
Please.
You're looking at the guy who peed in his Cowardly Lion costume in the third grade play.
Luckily, it fit the character so it looked like a strong acting choice.
- Right.
Of course.
Bye, Eric.
- Bye-bye now!
"Loki Hayes.
Larceny, arson, homicide, homicide, homicide, homicide, impersonating a forest ranger".
This just goes on and on.
Dan says he's gonna be at his apartment tonight after 11.
Oh, I hate eating so late.
Yeah.
There's a lot about this that isn't ideal.
So how are we gonna get the body from his apartment back to our freezer?
There's gonna be a lot of blood.
We need to wrap him up in something that doesn't leak.
We're gonna have to get him to the car in something that doesn't look suspicious.
With a body in it, that trunk is going to be heavy.
Then we won't carry it.
Oh, nothing sexier than a man and his dolly.
- Hello, dolly.
- Well, that's over.
- Is that everything?
- Do we bring a weapon?
I'm the weapon.
Somebody's cocky.
I have the element of surprise.
No one expects a tiny realtor lady to jump on their back and rip out their throat.
Besides, there's something I enjoy about the kill.
- Really?
- Yeah.
It's like a rush.
It feels like I'm giving my body something it needs in an intense and powerful way.
- Is it sexual?
- It's not not sexual.
We should go.
Wait here, I'll be right back.
Hey, get out of my way!
Well, ain't that the darndest Hi!
- Loki Hayes?
- The fuck you want?
This is your lucky day!
Joel, Sheila Hammond, Coby Real Estate.
Were you aware that your building was recently purchased by Southern California's largest condominium developer?
Oh, my God!
- The fuck I care?
- Great question.
The fuck you care is we've been tasked by that very developer to offer you a large cash settlement to forgo your current lease.
Oh, my God!
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Loki.
What do you think?
Can we crack the champagne?
My cousin in Queens had the same shit happen to her.
She got so much cash, she don't even talk to our family no more.
Yeah.
I want that.
Okay.
We'll draw up the paperwork.
While you grab some glasses.
- Champagne flutes if you have 'em.
- Flutes?
I think I may.
Is it, uh, just the three of us here?
- No.
I got a snake in my room.
- That's neat.
I may not have flutes.
I thought I did.
Oh, keep looking.
Any tapered glass will do.
It just tastes better in a fancy glass.
I think these are your pants.
I think you're right.
All I could find was Chardonnay gla What the fuck?
Let me assure you, this is totally normal.
As part of our inspectorial duties, all air ducts need to be checked and re-checked and then, sometimes I'm stuck.
Damn it!
There goes your security deposit.
What kind of realtor are you?
Residential, but commercial on request.
- Son of a bitch!
- Come back here!
Shit!
Ow!
Aah!
Shit!
Stay down!
Pussy.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't do it.
Honey, it's okay.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I just I'm fine.
Well, he saw our faces, so we're gonna have to go after him.
- I may have bit him.
- Uh-huh.
I mean, I don't know if I did.
His chains were really thick.
But if I did bite him, will he become like me?
We don't know how this spreads.
I never got bitten.
I didn't bite him.
I didn't taste any blood.
Do I have skin in my teeth?
I brought a knife in case something went wrong, and it did.
I had him, I just I couldn't do it.
Oh, honey, it's okay.
No, it's not.
Sometimes I feel like you're Batman and Robin is important.
I was gonna say I feel like you're Batman and Robin, and I'm Alfred.
Oh.
We're not gonna find him.
Let's go home.
- What are we gonna tell Dan?
- I don't know.
We have a couple of days till he gets back from his hunting/alibi trip.
It's all going to be fine.
I'm almost sure I didn't bite him.
- We're gonna be fine.
- Totally.
Mostly.
Honey, is my briefcase in the kitchen?
Yeah, it's right here.
I hope we didn't wake you last night when we got home.
The movie ran longer than we thought.
Is everything okay, Abby?
Is there something you wanna talk about?
No.
Everything's great.
Great.
- Here.
- Well, thank you.
No problem.
Housekeeping.
Housekeeping, I clean?
I come back.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
- I really don't think I bit him.
- But what if you did?
And what if that makes him turn, and then he bites someone, and they bite someone, and pretty soon, we're like the biggest assholes ever.
No, we're gonna be fine.
I didn't bite him.
Because if I had, I'd have gotten the tingle.
- Right.
- In my vagina.
- No, I got it.
-  That first moment when I tear into living flesh is like Totally up to speed, honey.
I should have killed him.
Sweetheart, it's not your fault that Loki got away.
You only had the one shoe on and you had a very light breakfast.
I used to be the guy, you know.
Crunch time?
Give Ice the ball.
"Ice"?
When did they call you "Ice"?
There was a guy.
It was an away game.
You didn't go.
- So there was one guy once.
- My point is Didn't they always give you the ball?
You were the quarterback.
All I'm saying is, if I had stopped Loki, we wouldn't be in a car for the better part of two days waiting for him to return.
- So you're not a killer.
-  I love you for who you are, not who you think you should be.
He's not coming home.
A guy like that, two strangers show up, you don't know who sent them or when they're coming back?
You don't return home.
You skip town.
Maybe.
Come on, Ice.
Ice.
Baby?
You're lucky you're cute and that's my favorite song in the entire world.
Come on, let's go home.
I promised Lisa we'd go to their barbecue.
- You clicked "yes" on the Evite?
- I did.
- I told you to click "maybe".
- Only douches click "maybe".
It's like saying, "Yes, unless something better comes along".
Or, "Yes, unless I fail to pull off a murder for your husband and he gets back from his alibi trip and wants to know how it went".
Just tell Dan you took care of it.
Loki's gone, and we covered our tracks.
There's nothing to tie us to anything.
It's like we were never there.
- Pretty good, huh?
- Yeah, it's amazing.
- I know.
- Hi, Amy.
- Hi, Sheila.
- Love your sandals.
Hey, Ed.
Got a beer.
All right.
Is small talk harder for you ever since we started killing people?
Yeah.
A little bit.
- Hey, Sheila!
- Hey, Kelly!
Look at your hat!
- I know!
-  Joel!
Excuse me, I gotta go lie to a cop and tell him I murdered somebody so I don't get in trouble.
Okay, I'll be over there with the girls drinking some guy from Vegas out of a straw, so I don't think anyone's getting a merit badge for honesty.
Anyway, the trick to planting rosebushes is you gotta get a little bone meal in there to nourish the root system.
Without bone meal, flowers are shit.
You didn't know that, did you?
I don't think I'm ever gonna like you.
- Here comes someone who likes me.
- You think so, huh?
Maybe you didn't hear, Rick, but Joel and I are best friends now.
- Right, Joel?
- Yes.
We are best friends now.
Thank God.
This "will they, won't they" thing has been going on too long.
- So, I paid a visit to your friend Loki.
- Not even gonna ask me about my trip?
- Okay, sure.
How was your trip?
- Who gives a shit?
You did it.
I thought you were too much of a pussy, but my CI said he missed his last two drops.
You fucking killed that What kind of a name is Loki, anyway?
I didn't ask before I fucking killed him.
But I'm pretty sure Loki's the trickster god from Norse mythology.
I took a class in junior college on folk and fables.
Credits didn't transfer, but it's paying off now.
Yeah, big time.
So, what'd you do with the body?
What didn't I do with the body?
That sounded more sexual than I intended.
I disposed of him respectfully.
- Dan.
- I'm talking with my friend.
- We need more meat.
- I'll get it, my love.
Stay here.
There's something else that we need to discuss.
I can't believe you're not eating any of this food.
You're so good.
Oh, no.
It all looks amazing.
I'm just straight-up addicted to these smoothies.
I am so impressed with your willpower.
I can't even get it together to end my affair.
Or at least stop talking about it with your husband 15 feet away.
Uh, the danger is part of what makes it so hot.
That and the filthy, filthy sex.
I mean, it's so crazy.
It's, like, feral, like street cats.
And the stamina.
Just fucking and fucking, fucking Please, I'm not getting the picture, more detail.
- Okay.
His dick - Oh, my God.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But you don't know what it's like to be trapped in an unloving third marriage.
You guys never have problems.
- I wouldn't say that.
- What?
Tell me.
What is it?
Did you catch Joel drawing pictures of another woman?
It just happened to my sister.
Yeah, no, that wasn't it.
Just, Joel and I do this thing together and I'm way better at it and I think he's feeling inadequate.
- Is it oral?
- No.
- It's, um - Oral?
No.
It's bowling.
And the last time we tried it together, I'm getting really good at it - and Joel couldn't even finish the game.
- You know what it sounds like?
Oral.
Well, maybe you should just keep doing your thing, whatever it is.
It might be bowling, we don't know.
But do it by yourself and encourage Joel to find something that he's good at.
- Huh.
- Yeah, like hand stuff.
Joel played trumpet in high school, so he's really good with his lips and his hands.
Plus, he can keep a beat.
- But thanks, Alondra, for your advice.
- You may not take it.
Most people don't.
My sister didn't listen to me and now she's getting divorced.
But we're super competitive, so I'm okay with it.
Anyway, she needs to sell her house.
- Do you have a card?
- No, but I have a pen.
It has all our information on it, so  anyone can find us.
Oh, my God, it was in my purse.
I can't find it.
Oh, fuck!
Damn it, damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
- Nice buns.
-  Nice icebreaker.
I haven't seen you around in a couple days.
I've been kind of busy.
Robots don't build themselves.
Yet.
Are we cool?
I mean, after what happened the other day?
The other day?
Oh, when I tried to kiss you and you pulled away, horrified.
- No, I totally forgot about that.
- Totally.
Me too.
I just don't want things to be awkward between us.
In case we ever do remember it.
I won't be awkward - Princess Leia.
- Yeah, like this.
- Hoo-ahh!
-  There he is.
Love that sound.
All man.
So I guess now you really want to kiss me.
This barbecue's boring.
Let's get out of here, do something fun.
Oh, I don't know.
Help me, Eric-wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.
Nerd.
You stayed.
Good boy.
You know, we've been best friends for 48 hours, so I feel like I can make a suggestion.
Maybe you don't be a dick to everybody, including your stepson.
Food for thought.
So, killer, I got another guy who needs to go.
- What?
- He's a sex trafficker.
You want me to kill again?
I've spent two years chasing this scumbag.
Every time I get close, he bribes someone, leaves town.
He's back for a few days to sell his product.
Girls, Joel.
He sells girls.
What kind of asshole doesn't kill a guy like that?
You're worse than he is.
First of all, no, I'm not.
And I thought we were done.
We're not done, buddy.
I've got two murders on you.
You know what you need?
Some of Lisa's coleslaw.
It's wonderful.
Hey, Joel, I brought you one of these beers I've been drinking.
It's got honey in it.
Honey?
Jesus Christ, Ed, that's such fucking good news.
When we borrowed your stepdad's tear gas, I saw these other things that looked kind of fun.
Here they are.
- These explode, right?
- Uh, kind of.
They're flash bang grenades.
- They're super loud and super bright.
- You know what'd be cool?
Taking a bunch to the desert and setting 'em off.
Oh, you know what'd be even cooler?
Putting them back and then not having Dan find out I took his stuff.
That'd be crazy, right?
-  -  - I yipped again, huh?
- Barely.
- Where'd it go?
- There.
I think it rolled under those shelves.
Oh, I see it.
Can you get it?
What the?
- Part of the wall just opened.
- What?
What are you talking about?
Help me.
Come on.
-  Fuck.
- Whoa.
- Look at all this stuff.
- Yeah.
It's gotta be Dan's.
He's a crooked cop.
He's got a closet full of illegal shit but he chews me out for riding my bike on the sidewalk.
What do you say we forget the flash bangs and have some real fun today?
I'm not doing cocaine, Abby.
I just have a feeling I would be unbearable.
I'm not talking about drugs.
Okay, that's an even worse idea.
Dan is definitely gonna notice if I steal $20,000 from him.
- He'll kill me.
-  You're right, it's insane.
Let's start with a thousand.
- We have a problem.
- I know.
I can't find my pen.
I'm gonna say my problem's bigger.
Bigger than I left my pen with our names on it at Loki's apartment?
Damn it.
Why can't we ever have one easy fucking day?
- I know!
- Dan wants me to kill again.
Oh, really?
Who does he want us to kill this time?
- Sex trafficker.
-  Nice and bad.
No.
We can't keep doing this for him.
Well, I'm almost finished with the guy in the freezer.
It's just thighs and giblets.
And what's worse than a sex trafficker?
Maybe we need to change our perspective on this.
Maybe Dan is working for us.
And he's like our little truffle pig just leading us to tasty morsels.
That may be the most beautiful thing anyone's ever said about Dan, but I'm sorry, honey, I'm just not doing it.
Okay.
I'm serious.
I thought about what you said in the car, and you're right, I'm not a killer.
All right.
I can do this alone.
I got a new kill poncho.
It's pink, you know, because why not?
You know, I'm not just talking about Dan.
I'm saying I'm not going with you at all anymore.
Got it.
- Ever.
- Roger that.
- Okay, what's your game?
- No game, honey.
You're just being really straightforward and honest with me and I truly appreciate that, so let's try your plan.
Good.
Let's.
And what's my role in my plan?
It's getting the pen, isn't it?
Sneaking into a criminal's apartment at night, not getting caught.
- Sneaking back out - With a pen.
I get it.
- I'm in charge of pens.
- Said the brutally handsome man.
- Now you're just making it worse.
- Am I, stud?
"A branch from Groot.
Guardians of the Galaxy, 2014".
Wow, I've never been this close to a celebrity.
You should buy it.
It's $1,000.
If we get this, we won't have anything left for you.
I don't care.
Wait are you just doing this because you feel bad about not kissing me?
No.
A little.
So much stuff has happened to me over the past couple of weeks but it's been okay because I've had you to talk to.
So when I see how your shitty stepdad treats you, I I just want to make you happy.
'Cause you deserve to be happy.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Let's buy you that stick.
First, Groot's not a stick.
He's a plant that believes in the power of community.
But even still, that's not gonna do it.
Okay, how about a communicator from Star Trek?
A wand from Now You See Me 2?
Kevin Bacon's hat from Tremors?
I like the hat but none of that's gonna make me happy.
Then what will?
- It's dumb.
- What?
Every day, Dan makes me feel small and stupid.
I'd like to make him feel that way.
Just once.
- What if we made him yip?
-  - That'd be sweet.
But how?
- I don't know.
But however we do it, you're gonna do it in Kevin Bacon's hat.
- All set.
- Do you have your poncho?
- Yep.
- Christmas tree bag?
- Got it.
- Did you remember a snack?
- Fingers.
- That's fun.
Now if you have any problem killing this guy, any problem at all, you call me, okay?
And if you have any problems finding that pen Yes, I'll call.
Look at us.
Dividing up tasks, nobody doing what they don't want to do.
- This is good for us.
- I guess.
Although I feel like I'm not really holding up my end.
Well, honey, we shouldn't force each other to do something the other person doesn't want to do.
Like when I dragged you to see the World Famous Lipizzaner Stallions.
It was eight horses walking sideways.
They don't even try to make it entertaining.
Larry King said it was the best show he'd ever seen.
Maybe, maybe for 30 seconds it's a little interesting.
Okay, I see your point.
We don't have to do everything together.
Exactly.
Like, when we're out of toilet paper, we don't have to both go run to the store.
- You want me to get toilet paper?
- Not if you don't want to.
There is a Rite Aid on your way home and you are looking for more ways to hold up your end.
Where are you, you sex-trafficking son of a bitch?
Oh, there he is.
It's okay.
You can do this solo.
-  -   Loki?
Hello?
-  Gah!
-   - Yo, who the fuck are you?
- Joel.
What's going on?
Where's Loki?
- I don't know.
- Get the fuck off his sofa.
You know how he feels about shoes on his furniture.
- There's a snake.
- Did you hurt Baby?
That snake's a rescue.
He's already been through a lot.
Yo, there's blood.
What the fuck is going on, Joel?
I mean, we're here to party with our boy Loki, everything's trashed and you're disrespecting the man's sofa.
Okay, I'll be honest.
Joel isn't my real name, it's Buck.
I came here to purchase cocaine.
Loki wasn't home and the place was in disarray.
I was starting to leave when I was startled by the snake, Baby, a rescue.
Now having explained myself, I'll go.
No cocaine for Buck.
Oh, well.
- Hey, Joel!
- Mm-hmm, yeah?
-  - You're not going anywhere.
Not until Marcus gets here.
He'll know what to do with you.
Siri, call Marcus, mobile.
There it is.
The second Dan digs too close, boom and yip.
I love this idea.
You're an evil genius.
Well, according to my SAT scores I'm just evil, but thank you.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Dan's gonna figure out it's you.
I know.
- You're not scared of him?
- Oh, I'm terrified.
But having you around makes it okay.
Oh, no, don't get all excited, I was talking to the hat.
Of course.
- Sheila?
- Hi.
Yep, it's me.
What are you doing here?
And why are you dressed like that?
Oh, this?
I was just on my way to a charity watermelon eating contest.
The mayor's gonna be there.
But how are you and what are you doing here?
And who is your friend?
Oh.
This is Bob, the guy I'm having an affair with.
And, Bob, this is Sheila.
She's the one who told me to have an affair.
Oh.
Hey, thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Actually, that wasn't at all what I said, but So, what do you do, Bob?
- Me.
In a doorway.
- Babe.
That is true, but that's not what pays the bills.
- I'm a pediatric oncologist.
- Oh.
Yeah, I was doing my whole pharma rep thing and I stopped by his office upstairs I didn't even really need her samples, but I just didn't want her to leave.
He donated them to a clinic he volunteers at.
Isn't he so sweet?
- Oh, my God.
You're a good person.
-  I was.
- Till I met this hot cup of coffee.
-  Well, have fun with your watermelon.
Hey, I'd love to make a donation.
What's your charity for?
Blind ness.
They wanna stop it.
Well, I don't have my checkbook, but I do have $200.
Is that?
Oh, my God.
Are you sure you don't want the other half of my Molly?
It'll relax you.
You've been a great hostess, Eva, but no, thank you.
I'd really like to go.
Sorry, not until Marcus gets here.
He really wants to talk to you.
Can I at least check my phone?
My wife is doing this thing tonight and I'm a little bit worried about her.
Ah, you love her, that's sweet.
I'm rooting for Marcus not to hurt you.
Me too.
What you worried about?
Little bit Marcus, but mostly because this thing my wife is doing is kind of dangerous and we usually do it together.
Aww, you wanna be with her because you love her.
That's beautiful.
Could I kiss your chest?
I don't think so.
- Can I rub your hair?
- I guess.
You know, my man is always making me do all this dangerous stuff by myself.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Why is he doing that to me, Joel?
I don't know.
Maybe he's not great at danger and thinks he would just get in your way.
You know, I never told him, but I want him with me.
- Having him there makes me feel better.
- Of course it does.
And he should wanna make you feel better.
He needs to stop only thinking about himself, put his issues aside, and be there for his wife.
We're not even married.
And I got a ton of shit to say about that, too.
- What the fuck?
- Yo, this is Joel.
And he didn't do nothing to Loki.
And he says you need to stop being a fucking pussy and come with me when I do my drops, and fucking put a ring on it, Marcus!
Marcus is your boyfriend?
Would've been good to know.
And I didn't call you a pussy.
She was being hyperbolic.
Oh, yeah, Eva's hyperbolic as shit.
But if she says you're cool, you can go.
- Really?
- Nope.
Huh.
Excellent news.
I got the pen.
Oh, my God.
I was so worried about you.
- What are you wearing?
- Some of Loki's friends came by.
We hung out for a while, then they knocked me out.
When I woke up, they were gone, along with my money and phone, and for some reason all my clothes.
- Which  I guess is funny.
- Oh, my God.
Honey, thank God you're okay.
How was your night with the sex trafficker?
A question I never thought I'd ask my wife.
Awful.
It turns out he wasn't a trafficker.
He was Lisa's boyfriend.
A nice pediatrician who gave me $200.
I almost killed an innocent man.
And even if I find a worthy charity to donate the money to, I'm still gonna get the tax write-off.
- Oh, sweetheart, it's okay.
- Ohh.
And I hated being there without you.
I was wrong.
I don't wanna do this alone.
It was like when I gave birth to Abby.
I did the messy parts, but I needed you to get me through it.
You're never gonna be alone again.
As much as I complain about Loki's friends, they made me realize I want to be there for you.
- I love that.
Thank you, Loki's friends.
- No more doing things separately.
From now on, we fuck everything up together.
Good.
Now what are we gonna do about Dan?
We have some stuff on him now.
I'll go over there tomorrow and tell him we're out.
Thank you.
You know, when I was about to kill that guy today, I got the tingle.
- Down there.
- I know where the tingle lives, honey.
Then why don't you go visit it.
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.
I'd love to.
-  Hey, Dan.
- Hey, buddy.
- I knocked on your door, no one answered.
- So you trespassed.
I could shoot you.
I'm just kidding!
Why would I shoot my friend?
So you, uh, do that thing we talked about yesterday?
No, and I'm not going to.
It's over, Dan.
And if you turn me in, I'll turn you in too.
- Into what?
- No.
I'll turn you in too.
In to what?
I'll turn you in also.
I have two files with your fingerprints all over them.
People you blackmailed me to kill, including your wife's boyfriend.
That's right.
I know everything.
Whoa, you hear that?
That's the sound of the tables turning.
So let me get this straight: you have a file on a guy who's not dead, and another file on an active case that you must've stolen from my house?
Well, that's another way of looking at it.
Joel, you just had your little moment, but let me tell you how this is gonna go down.
You're gonna keep doing what I tell you to, because if you don't, I'm not only gonna put you away, I'm gonna put your wife away too.
- She has nothing to do with this.
- Really?
I saw her with you the night you sprayed your lawn where you killed Gary.
I can build off of that.
Or I'll just plant some evidence.
I'm an LA Sheriff's Deputy, it's literally what we do.
You're the worst fucking neighbor.
You know what'd be fun?
If I just arrested Sheila.
What would you do then, Joel?
She's the one with the balls.
She sells the houses.
She's the closer, isn't she?
You know what you are?
You're my bitch.
Because that's what you're good at.
Unless I'm missing something.
Is there anything else you're good at, Joel?
Anything at all?
I'm pretty good with a shovel.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Life has been so hectic lately.
Work is crazy.
They gave us all new keyboards.
Oh, you're done.
I thought you were gonna list more things.
I have more, but it would just stress me out to talk about it, so I know, my life lately is just The baby's teething, my sister won another award for bravery.
She carried two Navy SEALs to her helicopter.
"Julie has upper body strength, let's all give her a prize".
And somebody at work is stealing my breast milk.
I think it's Todd.
He's the only one who eats cereal.
- So there were more things.
- So how are you?
My life's been a little intense.
What?
Tell me.
And be very specific.
Well, the other day - I misplaced my pen.
- Aww.
- But then I found it.
- Oh.
So with all that craziness going on, tomorrow we're taking a family day at the beach.
There's this food truck that Abby loves near the pier.
They sell fresh oysters and you shuck them yourself.
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.
- Oh, it's heaven.
You throw your blanket down, we listen to the waves.
- Not a care in the world.
- God, I love the beach.
It's so peaceful.
When I was a little girl, we'd go there and fly kites.
Oh, fuck!
I fucking love kites.
In the fucking sky, amongst the fucking clouds.
Boy, you're unusually passionate about kites.
That's awesome!
How have we never talked about this?
Do you prefer single line or double?
Whatever makes them go!
Go!
Go that way!
- So exciting.
We have to fly together.
- Oh, my God, we do.
- But right now, you have got to leave.
- What?
Why?
Why?
Because it's canning season and the peaches may already have gone bad.
- You like canning, too?
- Get out!
- What happened?
- I killed Dan.
I thought you were just going to talk to him.
Negotiations broke down, so I hit him in the head with a shovel.
- Oh, my God!
- It just happened.
He was threatening to send you to jail and saying mean things, and you kinda had to be there.
Come on, grab his leg.
- Let's get him inside.
- Okay.
I really appreciate you wanting to protect me from him.
It's so sweet.
It's so gallant.
Oh, but I can't believe you killed our neighbor - I know.
I know.
- who is a sheriff.
And it's just funny because you're always telling me we won't survive it if I act impulsive and Honey?
- So sweet, so gallant!
- Yeah.
Now lift his torso.
I don't want him leaving a stain on our floor.
And knowing Dan, he's gonna want to leave a stain.
Mmm.
That coffee smells great.
I love coffee.
Think about it.
It's a bean that you drink.
- Are you high?
- No.
I'm just feeling very grateful about coffee.
Now?
Okay we need to get Dan out of here and into the storage unit.
Right.
But we can't drag him to the car in broad daylight.
No.
If someone hadn't converted the garage to a home office we could pull the car in, load the body without anyone seeing.
Well, someone uses that home office as much as I do.
I don't think someone does, but let's drop it.
- Fine, it's dropped.
But they do.
- Fine.
I'll go to the storage unit, get the trunk and dolly, so we can load the body and wheel it to the car, which will never again be in the garage.
You really want to criticize my decision-making in front of our neighbor you just killed with a shovel?
Yes.
Easy, easy.
Would it be weird if I took his watch?
It'd be weird.
Gary did that too.
A dead woman would never do that.
- Ooh!
I can't believe you eat this.
- You eat meat.
Even after we saw that slaughterhouse documentary.
I cut out veal and I limited bacon to the weekends, that's all I can do.
Okay, on three.
One, two, three!
Shit.
Shit!
Let's not answer it.
It's Rick.
He knows we're home.
Our cars are out front.
- Because we don't have a garage.
- Fuck you.
- That's helpful.
- Guys, open up!
I got news about Dan.
How can there be news?
I just killed him an hour ago.
Well, now if we don't open the door we're really gonna look suspicious.
Plus, we should see what he knows.
Let's get him in the closet.
Oh, I forgot.
This is where we keep all the stuff we used to keep Yes, I'm sorry, there's no room for the dead guy you came home with.
Hey.
Oh.
Hey, Rick.
You got some news about Dan?
I was just coming back from a run and Are you guys all right?
You look flushed.
- We were fighting.
- We were having sex.
We were having sex and it turned into fighting.
- He tried a move I didn't care for.
- Still learning.
You said something about Dan or something?
You won't believe this.
I just ran into his partner outside.
Apparently, she came to pick him up for his shift this morning and he's missing.
- Can I get some water?
- Oh!
No, no, no.
No!
You may not.
You are the guest.
We are the hosts.
I will get some water, you stay here with Joel and finish your story.
Gentlemen.
Thank you.
So, what was the move?
- You were talking about Dan.
- Right.
So get this: his partner finds the front door unlocked, but no Dan.
His car's in the driveway, his phone's on the coffee table, his mini breakfast quiche is still in the microwave.
So sorry about that.
All me.
I farted.
I did that.
So Dan's partner called it in, and now there's a couple of squad cars looking around the neighborhood.
Oh, I hope they find him so I can give him shit about being too lazy to bake a proper quiche.
Ahh.
Thanks for the water.
I'll just Mmmwah!
You are so welcome!
Well, thanks for stopping by.
You take it from here.
Oh, by the way, that guy Anton you were looking for?
- I found his number.
- Really?
Tell me the move.
You can't handle the move.
Oh, God.
Fucking top-heavy Dan and his narcing butthole.
This is great.
Rick got that guy's number.
- What guy?
- The guy with the Serbian book that might have a cure.
- I'm gonna call him.
- Maybe tomorrow's project.
- Right.
Dan.
- What are we gonna do?
We can't just take him out of here.
Now there's a sheriff next door.
We can't leave him here.
Abby's gonna be home soon.
Okay, we have to stash him somewhere, somewhere Abby would never look.
- A bookshelf?
- I was gonna say a dishwasher.
Maybe in her trombone that cost us $600.
Or under the paddleboard she used four times.
- Master bath.
- Good.
She hasn't gone in there since she walked in on us in the tub.
That was funny.
That's a five-hour solution at best.
We need a plan.
I've always loved it in here.
The way the light comes in and dances with the colors on the wall.
This room isn't just a place I have to use, it's a place I want to use.
Hey, buddy.
Focus.
All right?
We're looking for a plan, not a blurb for Better Homes and Gardens.
- Seriously, are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.
We'll wait for the sheriffs to leave, go get a new trunk, - and move him to the storage unit tonight.
- Yes.
County sheriff.
- Motherfucker!
- Shit!
Try not to kill this one.
You've killed twice as many people as I have.
as I have.
Wow.
So tomorrow, I'm going to the beach with my parents.
I'm actually looking forward to it.
There's this oyster truck we always go to.
And the oysters are, like, okay, but the guy gave me a beer once.
Cool.
Should we go get a coffee?
I feel like we should stop and get a coffee.
You're nervous about going home and seeing Dan, aren't you?
When I left this morning, he was going to plant his rosebushes so I'm pretty sure the flash bang went off and it was a huge mistake and he's gonna kill me and I want to try coffee before I die.
Worst bucket list ever.
It's going to be good, Eric.
It's gonna force a confrontation.
Oh, I love those.
Look, what I mean is, what you have now obviously isn't working.
Dan's a bully.
If you don't stand up to bullies, they just keep coming at you.
And take it from me, I was a monster in elementary school.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe this will be a good thing.
Maybe it'll make Dan realize, you mess with this kitty cat, you get the claws.
Great.
How married are you to that wording?
He's gonna see I'm not gonna put up with any more of his crap.
- There you go.
- I'm gonna tell him, - "I'm not afraid of you, Dan".
- Perfect!
"And if you've got a problem with me watching Korean StarCraft tournaments instead of football, you can just suck my" I mean, maybe don't push it that far, 'cause sometimes with bullies "dick!
Suck my fucking dick, Dan".
I'm sure you'll find it in the moment.
Thank you.
Anytime a sheriff's deputy doesn't show up for work, we just wanna make sure everything's all right.
Oh of course.
- So either of you see Dan this morning?
- No.
Wish I had.
Great guy.
Wonderful guy.
I can't get enough of him.
Interesting.
He's been my partner for five years and I've found that most people just think he's unbelievably repellent.
Well, we don't want to speak ill of the missing.
- We love everyone, all of God's children.
- Amen to that.
Mmm.
You know, there is one thing that strikes me as a little strange.
What's that, Anne?
You two are friends with the Palmers, and you know Dan's missing, but you still haven't been over to check on Lisa.
- Is that strange or just inconsiderate?
- Inconsiderate.
Mystery solved.
You know, something like this can be very stressful for the family, and Lisa is such a beautiful woman.
- It would be great if you just came by.
- We definitely will.
- Love it.
- Yeah.
Is there anything else we can do to help?
- Just pray that Dan's all right.
- Will do.
Oh.
Right now.
Dear Lord, I sit with some of your flock to ask I'm home!
We're in here, praying.
Ha-ha.
- Shall I?
- Yes, please.
Dear Lord, I sit with some of your flock to ask Is there any Advil in your bathroom?
to ask for your help in bringing Dan safely back to us.
Lord, we love you Jesus fucking Christ!
Honey, I'll be right there.
I'm just down here with the sheriff!
Can you arrest a 16-year-old for having a foul mouth?
Teenagers.
Can't live with them, can live without them.
- That should totally be a T-shirt.
- What a funny sheriff.
Dear Lord Is the sheriff gone?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
You guys don't let me see The Godfather until I'm 15, but you fucking kill Dan and leave him in the bathtub for me to find?
I am so sorry that you had to see that.
He was blackmailing us, honey, and threatening our family.
I had no choice.
Wait.
You killed him?
Yes.
Men can kill, too.
Did you also kill the frozen guy in the storage unit?
- You know about that?
- Yeah.
And I've seen your blender and I know what's in your smoothies.
Look, you need to kill and eat people, I get that.
But here's what I need: no more lying to me.
We were just trying to protect you from the truth because we want our family to be as normal as possible.
You think this family is ever gonna be normal?
We want to be, honey.
That's why we're going to the beach tomorrow, although now we're probably not going to the beach tomorrow.
Right, because you killed our neighbor.
So, what's the plan?
Are we gonna keep him?
Do I finally get a brother?
We have a plan, but I feel like in your current state you're gonna judge it negatively.
You guys are not great at this, and if you don't get your act together we will never go to the beach because you will be in jail.
And I'm tired of walking in on weird shit going on in your bathtub.
We really lost the moral high ground on that one.
Yup.
Hey.
I just came to see how you're doing.
Look!
The flash bang went off.
Dan knows I'm the only one who could've put it there.
He's not missing.
He's laying low, plotting how to kill me and get away with it.
Something people would believe, like like a reading accident.
- Eric, breathe.
- Oh, my God, I'm not breathing.
- Oh, my God, I forgot how.
- Eric, listen to me.
What if I told you that you never had to worry about Dan ever again?
What?
Why not?
Ab Abby, do you know something?
He's in our bathtub, dead.
My parents killed him.
Can I see him?
Hello?
Whoa.
Jesus, that's a lot of cops.
Oh, you came.
Didn't bring any food.
We've already established we're inconsiderate people.
Yes.
Uh, I'll tell Lisa you're here.
Look at them.
All rugged individuals, yet working together.
In another time, they would've been cowboys.
What is going on with you?
And don't just say you're okay.
I don't know.
I see things I feel are true and I share them.
I've noticed.
And I'm worried about you.
Hi.
Thank you so much for coming over.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
I'm sure Dan is fine.
He's probably just in the desert shooting owls, or at the beach shooting starfish, or maybe at that strip club that has the bacon he likes.
He's a man of many interests.
I guess.
Sheila, can you help me in the kitchen?
Anne has been so useful, but she cannot julienne a carrot to save her life, even with those delicate, perfect fingers of hers.
Known her for five years, and this pretty lady still makes me blush about my fingers.
Well, maybe you shouldn't have such perfect fingers and then people wouldn't talk about them.
What am I gonna do with you?
Oh, stop it.
Come on.
- I'll be right back.
Are you good?
- I'm good.
Good, good.
Dan's probably fine.
I asked some of the boys to go to that strip club.
Had a lot of volunteers.
Sure, naked women supporting their kids.
Oh, that's from a trip to Maui the four of us took a couple of years ago.
It's so beautiful.
We went to a luau.
Cooked a pig right in the dirt.
Dan took the snout, put it on his nose and said a bunch of racist stuff.
It was not cool.
But, you know, we let it slide because it was a vacation, so We ate that pork, it was so good.
You wouldn't think meat cooked in the dirt could be that good.
a pod of dolphins swimming right in front of us.
Whoa, what's going on, Joel?
- Sorry.
- Something you wanna talk about?
What's up, guys?
I was telling Joel about Dan and Hawaii, - and then he started crying.
- Yeah.
Why are you crying, Joel?
Joel really looks up to Dan.
Dan's sort of like a father figure to him.
And now that he's missing, it's brought up a lot of abandonment issues.
Did your father leave?
- Nope.
- It's also brought up some denial issues.
Don't worry, Joel.
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna have guys in the neighborhood all night keeping an eye out.
If Dan doesn't turn up by tomorrow, we'll bring in some dogs to help.
Oh, you mean like therapy dogs to cheer up Lisa?
No, search dogs.
They can find a rubber glove buried ten feet underground.
If Dan's anywhere around here, they'll find him.
Fucking dogs!
- They're the greatest.
- Oh, they really are.
We should be licking them.
Maybe?
He was threatening my parents, he was gonna turn them in.
Eric?
You were right about one thing, Dan.
I won't be having sex in your lifetime.
- Whoa, coming in hot.
- He was such a jerk to my mom.
And this is probably the most quality time he's ever spent with me.
I'm just sorry I never got a chance to let him know how I feel.
You could tell him now.
I don't think he's going anywhere.
There was never a moment I wasn't scared of you.
But when I see you like this I realize you're just a small, sad man.
And who knows, maybe you treated me so badly because someone else did the same thing to you.
Wow.
- That's really sweet.
- I'm not done.
Still you can suck my dick.
That would only be like the third worst thing I've seen in this bathtub.
So, I think I know the answer, but I've got to ask.
- Are you gonna tell on my parents?
- No way.
I like your parents.
Besides, if they go to jail, you'll move away and then you'll miss me and I don't want that for you.
Right.
So I have a plan that might keep that from happening.
- I just need one thing.
- Anything.
Name it.
Whatever it is, I'll get it for you.
If I can't, I'll make it for you.
- A flashlight.
- Mine's broken.
Honestly.
Okay, today has obviously been intense and it's taking a toll on you.
We don't have time for this.
We have to get the body out of here by morning or the dogs will find it.
Honey, I just saw you stare at a picture of a beach and start crying.
We got married on a beach and you didn't cry.
I need you to let me take some of the weight off your shoulders.
Like about 200 pounds.
It's impossible.
You can't eat this much in one night.
It's the only way.
Dan will be in the one place they'll never look.
My stomach.
- How's it going in there?
- He is a very hairy man.
Kinda slows me down.
You're good at that.
I'm just thinking of it as a very long face with toes.
Thank you.
"My pleasure" wouldn't quite apply here.
But you're welcome.
God I'm becoming my father.
I can't do it.
I can't finish him.
The dogs will be here pretty soon.
- We're going to jail and it's my fault.
- How is it your fault?
I killed Dan.
I brought death into this house.
I'm the one that made killing seem normal.
And it is so not normal, Joel.
The way you've been acting today?
I broke you.
I'm so sorry.
No.
You're not the one who needs to apologize.
I'm sorry, dude.
Jesus, I killed you and I'm saying, "Sorry, dude," like I just beat you at beer pong.
I saw the most beautiful sunrise this morning.
I've been appreciating a lot of things these past 24 hours.
Maybe 'cause I've realized you never know when your neighbor might kill you with a shovel.
But I don't have to tell half of you that.
I guess what I mean by "sorry, dude" is I'm sorry you're never gonna enjoy the smell of coffee again, or see the way the light dances on the wall, or go to another beach in Hawaii.
Life is short.
You've got to appreciate it in whatever time you have left.
Huh.
Thanks, Dan.
This was helpful.
- We're going to the beach!
- What?
We promised Abby we're gonna be a normal family and that's what we're doing, goddamn it.
Going to the beach?
- That's right.
- It's a family day.
I wish there was more we could do to help with Dan.
But we'll be thinking about him.
Oh, let me get that for you.
Mind if I grab a soda?
Sorry, we don't drink sodas in this family, only milk.
- You're bringing milk to the beach?
- Well, they don't have it there.
Hey!
We found something.
It's in the garage.
- What do you think they found?
- A guy like Dan?
Could be anything.
Shall we?
You're right.
This whole thing would have been easier with a garage.
Maybe.
But I kinda like having a home office.
Hey, murderers, let's go to the beach.
I really need a beer.
Dan was into all kinds of shit.
They found drugs, money, weapons, even a finger that belonged to that guy who went missing from your office.
- Gary?
They think Dan killed Gary?
- They don't have a motive yet, but having the guy's finger makes Dan pretty suspicious.
They did some digging, found out Dan was also connected to some gangster named Loki, who turns out was blackmailing him.
And now Loki is missing too.
They think Dan was stashing his stuff when someone came to grab him.
Happened so fast, he didn't even turn off his flashlight.
- Life is amazing.
- I know.
This is the best goddamn day ever.
We should get high and go to Magic Mountain.
We really do have to get better at this.
Oh, fuck.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1     Hello.
I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood.
To say "hello"?
I know your "hello's," honey, and that one was pouring me a glass of wine.
Well, it's been a few days and I guess I've just gotten used to the frequency, intensity and sheer insanity of your undead libido.
It hasn't been that crazy.
Sweetheart, we had sex in the bathroom at Target 'cause their logo turned you on.
It's obviously designed to look like a clitoris.
I'm just feeling a little low energy.
Maybe I need to eat people with more iron in their diet.
It's okay.
We don't have to break a baby changing table every day.
How about I give you a foot massage?
No strings attached.
Uh - I have to bake brownies.
- Now?
It's 1:00 a.m. We have to check in on Lisa tomorrow so people don't get suspicious.
And nothing says "We didn't kill your husband" like a fresh plate of brownies.
-  - Can I at least lick the spoon?
Give me something.
So Dan is still officially considered missing, but I may have to face the fact that he's never coming back.
- That's terrible.
- We are so sorry.
- Can I have a brownie?
-  Of course.
Makes it a little easier knowing Dan was a crooked cop with a hundred grand stashed away while I'm running around with a $40 Michael Kors knock-off.
- Fuck you, that's a fake?
- That's why I can't wear it in the rain.
- Sounds like everyone's moving on nicely.
- Kebab time.
- Oh, hello.
I didn't know we had visitors.
- Oh, it's you.
Here.
How wonderful.
Joel, Sheila, you remember Anne, Dan's partner?
She has been so helpful to me and Eric these past couple days.
- I think it's what Dan would want.
- Such a rock.
- Wow.
- Uh-huh.
You guys want some shish kebabs?
No, thank you, we're not kebab people.
And we just came by to check on Lisa.
And now having done that, we will return to our home to watch television.
Did you tell them about that guy Loki?
That guy Loki?
We thought Dan had killed this drug dealer, Loki.
We found his apartment trashed, blood everywhere.
But it turns out, the guy's not dead.
Mmm.
Mmm!
Mmm!
- Nothing beats a juicy, fresh tomato.
- Anne grows tomatoes in her garden.
I thought they would be too dry this year.
Tomatoes.
What can't they do?
Vote?
Drive?
I don't know.
But, Loki?
Oh, yeah, he was holed up at the Starlight Motel.
Said this couple was trying to bite him.
He must have gotten into some bad drugs because he also vomited everywhere.
So Dan's not a double murderer.
Just a single murderer, who had $100,000 and told me we couldn't afford a housekeeper once a month.
Exactly how much vomit are we talking about here, Anne?
So much vomit.
We all thought he died.
But next day, he was gone.
This is a weird question, but did you happen to find something that looked like a small red ball?
No.
Just this medium red ball.
Oh, my God.
- I'd call that small, Esther.
- Maybe.
I have little hands.
- Still.
- Did he leave anything else?
Notebook.
I will not guess its size.
That's medium.
- Look.
- "Must kill"?
Oh, God.
We're nice and we've already killed three people.
Can you imagine what an undead person who started out as a murderer is going to do?
- And it's all our fault.
- We are such assholes.
We have to stop him.
I think we bought too much stuff.
We've never killed a dead person before.
I don't know how to shop for that.
You could start by staying out of the cosmetics aisle.
I needed a brush.
Just once I'd like to come home from a store with only the stuff on our list.
Oh, I don't remember a men's manicure kit being on our list.
Now I don't have to borrow yours.
Look, the whole system broke down after you bought the brush.
I just embraced the chaos.
Tight.
Does this hat make me look like The Edge?
No.
Wait, yes.
What do you want to hear?
- Well, I'm wearing it.
- You look awesome.
Do you think we should get a gun?
Statistically, if we have a gun, we're 2.7 times more likely to hurt ourselves than Loki.
As is our right.
I think between the icepick and your hammer-knife thing and your beautiful nails, we're gonna get the job done.
Get what job done?
The same job we do every day: selling a house.
It's in a bad neighborhood.
The bigger question is, why aren't you in school?
'Cause I'm selling a house in a bad neighborhood.
See how lame that excuse sounds?
We said we'd be honest with each other, okay?
I did not have a class last period.
Your turn.
Sweetie, we are not going to lie to you anymore.
But being honest does not mean that we are going to involve you in something where I may or may not look like The Edge.
Do you have any thoughts on this?
Yeah.
Take it off.
And take me with you.
You're clearly about to do the coolest thing - that anyone in this family's ever done.
- You're not going.
And we did that water jet pack thing together and that was pretty cool.
And you got to do it twice and I only got to go once, even though it was my idea.
This sucks.
And that jet pack thing was not your idea.
That mortgage broker gave you his Groupon because he was too fat to fly.
Are we wrong?
We've made mistakes as parents but we've never taken our kid to a murder.
I think we should hold firm on that.
The hat's out.
-  -   Did it take long to find me?
I asked the faithful light Did it take long to find me?
Hey.
Came from a Matrix movie marathon.
Oh, I'm being followed By a moonshadow Loki is gonna kill someone here in front of all these people?
He's completely out of control.
- Leapin' and hoppin' on a moonshadow - Uh Joel?
Moonshadow, moonshadow If I ever lose my hands Loki?
Lose my plow, lose my land And if I ever lose my hands We definitely bought too much stuff.
Oh, if I won't have to work no more It's my dad's.
I want to fix it up and ride it.
Why should my parents be the only ones who get to do cool stuff?
- You mean kill people?
- It's only bad people.
Come on.
One of the wheels is frozen.
Give me a hand.
Oh, uh, where are we taking it?
There is an illegal chop shop like two rows down.
Chop shop?
They chop things up, not fix them.
You're cute when you're scared.
Well, there's a lot more where that came from.
Sure, cupcake, I can fix it for you.
I take cash, grass, or ass.
And I'm good on cash and grass.
- Dude, I'm 16.
- Yeah, me, too.
Nobody wants to fuck you, shit stain.
Noted.
Look, I have $400.
How soon can you get it done?
- Tomorrow.
- Awesome.
- For 1200.
- 1200?
This is two years of babysitting money.
It's all I have.
I'm so sorry.
Turns out I don't give a fuck about your problem.
- Shit.
- Maybe I can help.
Wha?
- Where did you get that?
- Oh, this?
Took it from my stepdad's stash.
And you've just been carrying it around waiting for a cool time to pull it out?
Well, yesterday at the froyo place I gave the girl an $89 tip but neither of you were looking.
So maybe I can help.
My whole world changed in that motel room.
It's like I chucked up everything that was holding me back and woke up with this new energy and Focus?
That's exactly what I felt.
Do you sleep?
- Barely.
- Me neither.
Do you feel pain?
Never.
I carried a beehive out of our front yard.
I stared at the sun for an hour.
I ate a bottle to drive some drunks out of a park.
- You did?
When was this?
- Thursday.
I can't believe we were gonna stab you in the brain.
We have so much in common.
I have a question.
In your notebook it says you "must kill" tonight at 8:00?
Who are you planning on killing, Loki?
- Everyone.
- Jesus.
With my music.
I was actualizing what I wanted to happen in my performance.
And it worked.
A couple from Chatsworth bought a CD.
That's wonderful.
I I want one.
Oh.
Loki: So Alive.
I love it.
It's ironic, but the irony is for such a specific audience.
$19, seems steep.
And there's only seven songs and one's a reprise, so six.
Isn't it wonderful how being undead frees us to be who we want to be?
Yes!
Music was always my passion.
But I had no self-esteem, so instead I embraced violence, like a drop of dew embraces a blade of grass.
- Hmm.
- Hang on a second.
"Like a drop of dew embraces a blade of grass".
That's good.
Really?
You like that?
I think the imagery feels a little familiar.
I think it's beautiful.
"Blade of grass".
Blade?
Violence?
It's the twist on the familiar that makes it so profound.
So we disagree.
So who are you planning on eating, Loki?
'Cause you are killing people, right?
- It's not all just singin' and dancin'.
- I made a deal with my old gang.
They let me go, and if they need to get rid of a body they leave it in my van in the Magic Mountain parking lot.
By the way, that's, like, the third sketchiest thing happening in that parking lot.
Hey, you guys should join me for a meal sometime.
-  - Actually, Joel doesn't eat people.
He's not one of us.
Oh.
That's cool.
You think?
'Cause it feels like you're being judgmental.
Honey, do you think you could pay our tab so we could leave?
Also, uh, put something in Loki's tip jar for the CD.
- Please, that would be an insult.
- Done.
Thank you, honey, so much.
My fucking toe fell off.
- What?
- The little one, it just dropped off.
Has anything like that happened to you?
- No.
That must be awful.
- I haven't told Joel yet.
He's not gonna be able to handle me deteriorating.
- Maybe I can help you.
- Really?
We're the only two like us.
We have to look out for each other.
And learn from each other.
Thank you.
And may I share something with you?
If you miss eating pizza, eat a man who just ate pizza.
Smart.
Mr. Magnet!
Open up.
It's Abby.
Uh, the underage redhead you wanted to bone.
He might not remember your name.
The padlock's off the door.
Oh, my God.
Whoa.
Damn.
Is that heroin?
Judging by the smile on his face, I'm guessing it's not insulin.
- Check his pulse.
- You check his pulse.
- He liked you better.
-  Yes, he did!
He's cold.
-  - Should we call the police?
Here's my perspective on that.
We hired a guy who does illegal stuff to fix a bike we're not legally allowed to ride with money I stole from a corrupt cop whose body is in your parents' freezer.
So, no.
I get that.
Okay.
Let's grab my dad's bike and get out of here.
Where is it?
I think it's everywhere.
He took our money and chopped it up for parts?
Wow.
What a valuable learning experience.
Shall we go?
When my parents see my dad's bike is missing they're gonna freak out.
- Huh.
- What?
I'm just thinking, my mom eats people, and this is a person.
Those are both true statements, but I don't like the way you're connecting them.
They're gonna be mad about the bike, anyway.
If we keep him, my mom gets a few meals out of it and I get to show them I can handle their world.
Plus, something tells me Travis would enjoy a woman eating him.
Oh, hi.
How are you?
- I'm fine.
What's that?
- Just a text.
- Is it Loki?
- I can't tell you that.
That would be a violation of my Fourth Amendment right to privacy.
That's interesting.
You haven't cited that amendment before.
Well, I'm citing it now because, well, I take the Fifth on that.
It's just hard to see you connecting with someone when you and I haven't exactly been burning up the bed sheets, we literally did last week when our candle play got out of hand.
So can I please see the text to put my mind at ease?
- Are you saying you don't trust me?
- Of course I trust you.
You know what, I'mma go downstairs, make a sandwich, and watch the game.
He's too big.
Plus, he won't bend, he's got rigor mortis.
Damn it.
You try to do something nice for your family.
Okay.
Weird idea?
If we break his elbows and kneecaps, we can bend his limbs the wrong way and maybe Tetris the whole thing in.
Wow.
Okay.
Sure, I took karate as a kid.
Yeah, grab his leg.
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
Ready?
I'm gonna I'm gonna snap this dead guy's leg.
You don't have to do this, Abby.
If he's still in one piece, we can put him back.
- But once we break him, we own him.
- My parents kill people.
My mom puts them in blenders and eats them.
I can do this.
- On three.
Ready?
-  One two - Can I look?
- Not yet.
- No peeking.
- Okay.
Now.
Wow.
A box full of feet.
I only needed the one toe but you got me a literal foot locker.
We can match the perfect color and size, and I know a doctor who can clip off the toe and sew it on you.
All he'll want is some cocaine and a handwritten thank you note.
Well, that's great, but where did you get all these?
From small, bad men who were no longer using them.
Well, if they were just going to waste Mmm Sheila.
Your skin is so soft and cold.
What are you doing?
Sheila, as far as we know, we're the only people like us in the world.
- We should be together.
- What?
I'm married.
I've only met you twice and both times I was trying to kill you.
So our relationship starts from a place of passion.
No, this is crazy.
I love my husband.
It's just really disappointing.
Even dead men and women can't be friends.
Fuck.
- I will never give up, my evening rose.
-  -  - "I will never give up, my evening rose".
Also murder Joel.
I'll wipe off my fingerprints.
I'm such an idiot.
I lost your money, I let some creep chop my dad's bike up into a million pieces.
My parents are right.
I'm not ready for anything.
Seriously?
Abby, you are the most awesome, capable person I've ever met.
You tear-gassed a drug dealer.
You gave me the confidence to stand up to my stepdad.
You saved your parents from a murder charge with just a flashlight like you're freakin' MacGyver.
Was that too honest?
Was it just weird?
Do you know who MacGyver is?
Yes.
And you're always weird.
All right, so was the needle in his right arm, or his left?
I don't remember, uh, but I think it was in his left.
-  Okay.
- Careful.
All right, here we go.
You ready?
One, two and I'll just put it right here, that's good.
What's that?
When'd you learn how to drive a motorcycle?
Now.
Oh.
-  Whoo-hoo!
-  Motherfuckers!
Joel?
Joel?
Whassup, Santa Clarita?
March 27, 2000: that sign stood in front of our first listing.
- Everyone said we'd never sell it.
- The two-bedroom colonial.
- With the unpermitted garage.
- We closed at asking.
-  -  Afterward, to mark the occasion, I made you the only meal I knew how to cook.
Spaghetti and meatballs.
Ohh.
- This is so sweet.
I wish I could eat it.
- You can.
It's made from 100 percent free-range Dan.
- Really?
- The noodles are striated biceps.
The meatballs are from Honestly, I don't know where they're from.
It was a horrible mess.
Somewhere in the chest cavity.
- I can't believe you did all this.
- It wasn't easy.
I puked twice.
Also, I think we're gonna have to throw out the pasta maker.
I left it to soak, but it's not looking good.
Did you try vinegar and baking soda?
That's how I got Gary out of my shoes.
Oh.
I shouldn't have made such a big deal about Loki.
It just freaked me out you two having so much in common.
But then I realized we've spent half our lives together.
No one will ever have more in common with you than I do.
That's wonderful.
And you're right, Loki is no threat to you.
Sheila!
What are you doing?
I told you I'm not interested.
And what's with the door, man?
- You totally fucked up our door.
- I have the answer to your toe problem.
- You have a toe problem?
- I was going to tell you Her toe fell off.
She knew you wouldn't be able to handle it.
- Your toe fell off?
Oh, my God!
- See?
- Shut up.
- You shut up.
No, you, and I'm really pissed about the door.
- Guys!
- Sheila, come away with me, and your toe problem won't be a problem, because I will accept you no matter how much you deteriorate.
You and I are the same.
We should be together.
Okay, look, clearly neither one of us wants to fight.
And I don't blame us.
I mean, look how big we are  and how strong.
Sorry, Joel, you seem like a nice man, but for Sheila to be free she has to stop clinging to her past.
-  -  - Whassup!
-  Come on!
Let's go, go.
We have to kill him.
It's our only way out.
- I know.
So why did we come upstairs?
- To get our weapons.
You mean the ones we weren't going to use so I put them back in the kitchen and the garage?
- Yes, those!
- Don't you get upset with me.
You're the one who bought me that Japanese tidying-up book.
I just wanted your shoes out of the hallway.
Sheila!
- Quick, barricade the door.
- Okay.
Why didn't you want me to know about your toe?
That why we weren't having sex?
- You didn't want me to see it?
- Yes.
- Honey, I can handle it.
- I don't know if I can handle it.
Okay?
What if this keeps happening to me?
What if I'm breaking apart?
What if I lose control and you have to kill me?
What if we're too young to get married?
What if we can't sell a house?
What if this baby changing table can't support our weight?
We'll figure it out, honey.
We always have.
-  -  - Or we'll just die right here.
- At least we'll die together.
- Huh.
- Sheila!
This is the right thing.
In time you'll see it.
I take back everything I said about that brush.
I got the body in the car.
Are you sure you can't eat him?
- It seems like such a waste.
- The undead can't eat the undead.
They're too dead.
Come here.
I want to see your toe.
I don't think so.
Maybe you never have to see it.
Maybe I just can have sex with my socks on.
Or heels.
Bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?
I would.
But eventually I'd want to take them off of you.
Okay, get ready to have whatever the opposite of a boner is.
Is that it?
That's nothing.
So far.
But what if it's just the beginning?
Honey, we're gonna be okay.
We're gonna find a cure.
I've left messages for that guy with the Serbian book.
- But he didn't call you back.
- We will find him, I promise you.
In the meantime, you and I are gonna get through this togeth The fuck is that?
- What?
- Wow.
Uh-oh.
Wow!
I'm gonna hit the highway And I never look back 'Cause you're just a memory I wish I never had When the walls close in It's time to get out Don't matter what's in front of me I'll find a way 'round it It don't matter no more I got my foot to the floor Like a bullet from a gun I was born to run I'm breakin' outta hell Breakin' outta hell I'm breakin' outta hell Breakin' outta hell I'm breakin' out, breakin' out - Breakin' out - Breakin' outta hell I'm breakin' Outta hell
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1 - Honey, it happened.
I heard from him.
- Heard from who?
That guy Anton with the medieval Serbian book that might have a cure for Whoa.
Your eye is a little wonky there.
Ever since I shoved it back in, it occasionally drifts.
Would you mind fixing it for me?
Oh, uh Come on.
I have a really hard time lining it up straight, okay?
Please?
I'll make it up to you.
Sure.
Although I can't quite tell if you're flirting with me or my flip-flops.
- So, what did Anton say?
- It was a text.
Said he'd meet with me, but only in public and only if I stop calling him.
- This feels weird.
- Don't think about it.
- How many times did you call?
-  I'm not telling.
You might take my phone away.
He's gonna be at a paranormal conference today in Oxnard.
He meets you, you put on your little horror show, eat a finger, let him stab you in the stomach, - and he'll have to let us see that book.
- Okay.
Happy about that.
Less happy about being called a horror show.
Ooh, wait, right there.
Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, now press it until you hear a pop.
- No.
Come on.
Go on.
-  -  Now we're grooving.
Yay.
Eric's been to a bunch of these conventions and said he'd come in case we need help translating nerd to English.
-  -  Hmm.
ParanormalCon.
You know, it's too bad that Anton isn't a hamster because then we could communicate with him through Vicky the Pet Psychic.
I know a lot of this seems improbable, but I also never thought one day I might be making a Snapple cap sound with my wife's eyeball.
- Hey, everyone.
Don't freak out.
-  Why would we Because a cop's bringing your daughter home.
I got a call from a colleague who pulled Abby over for running a stop sign, on a motorcycle without plates or a VIN number, in a jacket that says "Pussy Magnet".
- What?
- My God, that's a lot for me to process.
The smartest thing she did was drop my name to the officer.
Thank you, Rick, for bringing her home.
If you really want to thank me, you'll invite me over when you cook up this beautiful meat.
- You doing Korean barbecue?
- Not Korean.
Whatever.
It's calling my name.
- Could have, a week ago.
- You were riding a motorcycle?
Are you crazy?
I mean, where did you even get it?
I decided to fix up Dad's bike, so I took it to this chop shop.
The guy there completely ripped me off, and then he OD'd and died.
So I took his bike and I would continue but Dad's already blinking a lot.
Abby, there are about six points in that story - where you could've gotten killed.
- Seven, if you include this one.
You could've gotten arrested.
This could go on your permanent record.
- You might not get into college.
-  - I might not want to go to college.
-  - What?
- Who cares what you want?
What your daddy is trying to say is that we don't care what you want.
- Obviously, we're upset.
- We're upset.
I forgive you.
I'll be upstairs being grounded.
Good, 'cause you're grounded!
God, that felt hollow.
She stole a motorcycle and doesn't want to go to college.
We're losing control.
I'm gonna skip the convention today and spend some time with her.
Honey, this guy, Anton, has the book that might have a cure.
This might be the only chance we get to talk to him.
Lately, there's always something more important than Abby.
We have to go buy a meat freezer.
I have to eat the dead guy in the tub.
I gotta go find the femur I lost in the driveway.
I know we've been distracted, apparently enough for you to lose a human bone in the front yard.
- It had rolled under the car.
I found it.
- Fantastic.
My point is there'll be plenty of time for Abby after you're better.
Honey I know that you want to believe there's a cure, but what if there's not?
Don't talk like that.
There has to be.
- We have to try, even if it's a long shot.
- It is a long shot.
But it's a sure thing that my daughter needs me.
And I need to know that if I'm not gonna be here, she's gonna be okay.
Fine.
I'll just go with Eric.
How hard can it be to get a nervous paranoid recluse to show me his most prized possession?
I have faith in you.
I also believe that you won't be the only guy at a paranormal convention without a woman on his arm.
Thank you for taking Eric to the freak convention.
He's so excited he took two showers.
He sweats.
Please, leave us something to talk about.
So, how are you doing?
I'm good.
Dan's partner, Anne, has been keeping me distracted.
She comes, like, all the time.
That must be nice.
Really nice.
-  - Eric, you have a gentleman caller.
Mom, you don't have to sexualize everything.
- He's not wrong.
- Oh, you two.
Hey, you told me you would clean up your room before you left.
- I'll do it when I get home.
- Promise is a promise, mister.
- Do it now.
- Okay.
Have fun today.
I love you.
Ohh!
Goddamn, you still have that new baby smell.
Ohh - I didn't hear any of that.
- Excellent.
Hey, thanks again for taking me to the convention.
Dan never went to these with me.
He said it should be called a para-not-normal convention.
I told him that's what paranormal already meant, then he accidentally spilled beer on my Xbox.
- So, any news about finding your stepdad?
- You mean since you killed him?
Oh, that's a thing that you know.
Abby told me.
I'm really sorry, Eric.
He kept pushing me and pushing me, and I just snapped.
Hey, it could happen to Well, "anybody" is probably too broad of a category when talking about murdering someone with a shovel.
I am not a murderer.
Okay, technically, I am.
Not even technically.
Literally.
But I refuse to be defined by the one time I murdered somebody.
But enough about me.
How are you holding up?
I've stopped sleeping.
Every time I close my eyes, I see Dan calling to me.
Oh, Jesus, Eric.
I am so sorry.
No, I'm just messing with you.
Dan was an awful man and I'm glad he's gone.
Do you know how to fold a hoodie?
Yeah.
The secret is to not give a shit, 'cause I have to save my wife.
Let's go.
- And I hang mine in the closet.
- You hang it, okay.
After we return the motorcycle, I thought we could go have tea at that cute little tea shop?
Like when you were little?
Remember, that place with the scones?
If you don't answer, will I end every sentence in a question?
Yes?
I don't see why we have to return the bike.
The guy's dead.
He doesn't care.
Well, I'm dead and I care.
You took something that doesn't belong to you.
- You need to learn that's wrong.
-  Oh, excuse me, sir?
Do you work here?
Hey, that's my brother's bike.
Oh, you're the deceased's brother.
I'm so sorry.
He was a great man.
What the fuck are you doing with his bike?
My daughter borrowed it and wants to return it.
Borrowed it or stoled it?
Uh, well, since she's bringing it back, definitely borrowed.
And "stoled" is not a word.
What?
How is he gonna learn?
- College.
- Smooth.
While I enjoy mother/daughter stuff on the Internet, this isn't working for me.
So why don't you get out of here before I press charges.
I'm the one who should be pressing charges.
Your brother took my money and didn't fix my bike.
My brother was a stupid fucking idiot, so if he ripped you off, - that makes you a stupider fucking idiot.
- All right.
I was just trying to teach my daughter a lesson about doing the right thing but having experienced you, I think you should give her the money back.
Now.
Fine.
Fuck it.
I'll get it for you.
Wait here.
-  - See?
Now we're learning another lesson.
If you treat people firmly but with respect   you're more likely to get what you want.
- He's not coming out.
- It would appear not.
Now what lesson are we learning?
-  - To let it go.
We're gonna go have our tea and we're not gonna let our day be ruined by some pervert who can't even look us in the eye when he's cheating us.
What kind of tea are you gonna get?
Probably like a nice steaming cup of fuck you, motherfucker!
You donkey fucker, give us our fucking money back!
I think we're gonna do different mother/daughter stuff today.
Awesome.
Can we not call it mother/daughter stuff?
- I know.
He totally ruined that.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Where is this guy?
He'll be here.
Check it out.
I got a churro saber.
This place feels a little less than scientific.
Don't lose your faith.
Anton is the real deal.
He's got files proving the government's been suppressing the existence of the undead.
- Bite?
- Pass.
Yeah, it's not very good.
Once you get food over three feet long, it's more about structural integrity than flavor.
- Excuse me.
I'm trying to find someone.
- Someone?
Yeah.
His name's Anton.
- Anton?
- Hey, Bordan.
- Eric.
- Oh, you two know each other?
Hi, I'm Joel, Eric's friend.
I'm thirsty.
What the hell was that?
These people aren't like you.
You can't come on that strong.
"I'm Joel" is too strong?
Yes, with those piercing eyes and perfect posture, you're like that hundred foot tall Christ statue overlooking Rio.
You need to be more like well, Bordan.
I'm not sure I can do that, because I can operate a juice box.
Well, you're gonna have to try 'cause Anton just came in.
Oh, my God, that's him?
- Come on, I need answers.
- Whoa, Jack Bauer, dial it down.
Less  "I need answers," and more  "Excuse me, hi, I'm so sorry.
Um, I have a question".
Yeah.
There's got to be something in here we can use to get that guy out of there so we can talk to him.
I have tear gas that Eric and I stole from Dan.
Oh, my God, you stole tear gas from Dan?
Dad killed him and you ate him.
Yes, we haven't been the best role models lately, but that's what today is about.
We're going to find a non-violent solution to your problem.
Oh, look.
It's my old college pencil.
- What?
- Not really.
I'm just looking for a way to talk to you about college.
Why don't you want to go?
Maybe I just want to live a little freer.
You know, like you do now, less about planning and the future and more about living in the moment.
Yes, it's fun to be carefree and spontaneous, and less hirable in a depressed job market.
Plans are important too, honey.
Plans?
A couple of weeks ago you said I should drop out of school and be a poet.
Sometimes I say things impulsively now.
That's why I'm not allowed back at Starbucks anymore, where that bitch works.
Mom, I'm old enough to make my own decisions.
I'm not a little girl who needs to listen to Raffi to fall asleep.
Oh, my God, Raffi.
You used to play him over and over and over until I couldn't take it anymore.
Baby beluga Oh, baby beluga Is the water warm?
Is your mama home with you so happy?
You know what might help?
Strap this to the front of the car and drive it through his door.
Baby beluga, oh 1950s the government secretly detonates nukes over Bikini Atoll, poisoning thousands.
1960s, the CIA secretly tests its MKUltra mind control project.
2012, a man in Florida eats another man's face and they want you to think that he's high on bath salts?
If you believe that, I got a Japanese sex doll to sell you, unused.
Uh, didn't you also recently discover evidence of an undead anomaly in 19th century Poland?
- Very good.
- Thank you.
Rybnik, 1870.
Three priests walk into a tavern and, no, that is not the beginning of a joke.
A local farmer set upon them and ate them down to their collars.
I have the pictures.
The government came up with all sorts of excuses: bad vodka, poisonous flowers, Jews.
What about Serbia?
What?
Didn't your research also uncover a book about an event in Serbia or not?
I don't know.
16th century Pozica.
You've done your homework.
Yeah.
Big fan.
I'm Joel.
Oh, you're the guy who's called me a billion times.
May I see the book, please?
I don't know you and I don't take it out in public, but I do keep a digitized version of it along with ten gigs of paranormal, classified documents right here on this thumb drive.
This is the truth, my friends.
Look at it!
Now, stop looking at it.
I'm just kidding, you can look at it.
No, don't!
Too many people want this and I don't want your lives to be in the same danger as mine.
- I need to see it.
- Whoa!
Look at this guy.
What is your deal?
You work for the government?
- Does anyone here know this dude?
- I do.
He's cool.
SpaceBaller 2000.
I moderate the Zombie Town subreddit.
Well, if SpaceBaller 2000 vouches for him then I guess I can let my guard down.
Good reflexes.
Bet you played a lot of ball before you sold out and joined Big Brother.
I'm not with the government.
I just need your help.
Nice try blending in, you handsome thick-haired son of a bitch.
I knew I should've bought you a hat.
Mom, it's not working.
Hey, put Raffi back on.
He makes me happy.
Yeah.
He makes everybody happy.
That's why he's a multi-generational success.
You and your daughter's asses are a multi-generational success.
Stop reducing us to only sexual beings.
Oh, keep talking, I'm almost finished.
Goddammit.
- You okay?
- Okay.
New lesson: if at first you don't succeed - then blast his ass with tear gas.
- Yeah!
- Yeah, you do!
-  Put your pants on, bitch, 'cause you're coming out!
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.
- This is it.
Chop shop's right under us.
- Okay.
You hold open the grate, I'll drop the tear gas into the vent.
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- Yeah, I teargassed Sarah's ex-boyfriend.
- Cole?
Oh, my God.
I almost ate that guy.
- Really?
Mm-hmm.
We're learning so much about each other today.
Oh, shit, it's the wrong unit!
We're right over the chop shop.
What kind of screwed up ventilation system do they have here?
- We teargassed two innocent people.
- Uh I just wanted to spend a nice day with my daughter and set a good example.
What the fuck happened?
I should at least stop cussing.
That's not even that fucking hard.
-  - I need that flash drive.
I should've brought a shovel.
I've gotten pretty good with a shovel.
Remember, we're not letting that one murder define us.
Look, Anton thinks you're government, let me talk to him.
Hey.
So you moderate that Zombie Town subreddit.
Oh, you're a fan?
Uh, uh I'm super busy right now but, uh, I guess I could sign something.
No, actually, I just wanted to ask you a few questions about the, uh, undead subject you've been in contact with.
What undead subject?
Uh, he's been writing about a post-mortem female who's killed and consumed several people.
- What?
-  Yeah.
You have?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Are you posting about Sheila?
You put my whole family at risk.
I thought someone might know something.
Really?
Or were you just trying to win some nerd popularity contest?
Ooh, that hurts.
Maybe I wasn't thinking clearly because my dual-income household was just reduced to a single-income household.
I knew you weren't cool with me killing your stepdad.
I thought I was, but when a squid's under attack he throws out ink.
You're not a squid, you're a boy who smells like a baby.
- I thought you didn't hear that.
- Of course I heard it.
I'm done messing around.
I'm doing this my way.
I can't believe this day got away from me.
I had fun.
Yeah, me too, but I wanted it to be about more than that.
Right.
You wanted me to learn something.
Mom, I know the past tense of stole and today I realized that air vents don't always line up with the unit below them.
- I have all the tools I need.
- Yeah.
But you also stole a motorcycle, and now you don't even want to go to college.
Why do I have to decide about college right now?
Because I need to make sure you're gonna be okay if I'm not here.
Not here?
What are you talking about?
One of my toes fell off and this eye is a bit of a jumper.
Little bugger doesn't want to stay in its socket.
What are you saying, you're dying?
I mean, like, really dying?
I don't know.
- Oh, my God.
- We're trying to figure it out.
Your dad is actually meeting with a guy today who might be able to help me.
- And you didn't go with him?
- No.
Because I wanted to do mother/daughter stuff.
And, yes, I'm taking that phrase back.
Is it too late to get tea?
Stop peeing.
- I can't.
- I said stop.
-  - Oh, God.
Okay, I stopped.
What do you want?
My wife's life is in danger and yours is, too, if you don't give me that flash drive.
- You're peeing again.
- I can't help it.
Here, just take it.
Finally.
Is it encrypted?
-  - No.
And just so you don't get really, really mad and stalkery later, there's nothing on it.
Then where's the book?
-  - I need the goddamn book.
I don't have it, I swear.
I just pretended I did.
All these people want something to believe in.
I'm just here to help them with that.
My name's not even Anton, it's Artie.
- Artie?
- Yeah, Joel?
I wasn't addressing you, I was digesting it.
Oh.
If it's all made up, why is the government after you?
They're not.
I just say that 'cause it gives me credibility.
So it's all bullshit?
You gave everyone false hope there's a cure?
A cure for what?
- You son of a bitch.
- Ow!
Just get out.
Fuck!
Now what?
Shame about Anton.
We had high hopes for him.
But when you work in the field of necrobiology you get used to a lot of dead ends.
Ooh, another mysterious and intriguing person.
- I really want to know more.
-  Did she throw up a red ball?
Was her transition also marked by a lack of impulse control, an unchecked libido?
We destroyed a changing table in a Target bathroom.
I think that covers both.
Who are you?
I'm no one but the woman who sends me to these things might be able to help you.
She's an ex-CDC scientist who specializes in fringe virology.
I'll tell her to expect your call.
Dr. Cora Wolf.
- You know, I've had a tough couple of - This is real.
It's a good thing Eric posted about this or I would've never found you.
- Come on, we're leaving.
- Joel, wait.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have talked about Sheila online, and you were right, I was trying to impress all these people.
You've been cool your whole life but I've always been well, invisible.
So, I was wrong and it won't happen again.
I'm sorry, I was thinking about how handsome I am.
What?
- Seriously?
- Of course not.
What do you think I am?
I heard you.
But did you really think you could get away - with stealing government documents?
- What?
I'm taking you in, Eric Bemis!
Oh, my God, you're making me so impressive right now.
Shut up!
You're under arrest for knowing more than any one man has the right to.
I won't shut up!
You can put my body back in hibernation fluid but my mind will always roam free!
- Too big?
- I certainly wouldn't go any bigger.
-  Sheila?
-  I'm in here.
- How'd it go with Anton?
- Total fraud.
I almost hit him, and I'm not sure I would've stopped.
Oh, no.
I keep telling myself I'm not that guy, but maybe I am.
Maybe we're both different people now.
So we'll be different together.
I got a card for a doctor up north.
- I know it's another long shot, but - Whatever it is, I'm in.
You are?
Abby's gonna grow up to be an amazing woman, and I want to be around to see as much of that as I can.
So if there's a chance for a cure, no matter how much of a long shot, I wanna take it.
Thank God.
On the way home, I came up with this whole speech to try to talk you into it.
Yeah, it ended like that.
Hmm.
Hello?
Oh, Mr. Hammond.
I've been expecting your call.
I see.
And how long has she been like this?
Really?
Fascinating.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 Sometimes the world casts aside the one person who can save it.
She began life as a mere baby, but by the third grade that would all change.
With an IQ of 172, but a cold and distant father who may or may not have looked like this man, young Dr. Wolf would soon be sent to a special school for geniuses.
You know, we did our own research on Dr. Wolf, so this was really unnecessarily fun and great.
Bravo.
I got a little excited when I heard she was coming.
Had a couple of Mountain Dews, found this stock footage website, don't have a lot of friends, and here we are, so Earning a PhD at 17, Dr. Wolf went to work for the Centers for Disease Control, perhaps placing things in very cold vats.
And then one day, something happened in a West Virginia cabin that would forever change her life.
Two hikers were discovered dead and partially eaten.
After speeding to the scene, Dr. Wolf discovered something even more horrible: the suspect had murdered and eaten his entire family.
What kind of monster could do this?
After running a series of tests, she reached a startling conclusion: the madman harbored an unknown virus that re-animates the dead.
Tragically, she was ridiculed and fired.
Dr. Wolf went on to start her own biotech company, where she worked with teams of equally attractive people to become enormously successful.
Yet convinced the virus is real, Dr. Wolf has continued to search for a cure so that the horror she witnessed in that West Virginia cabin will never happen again.
Oh, my God.
The end played a little darker than I expected.
But Kanye says never to apologize for your creative choices.
Although I really wish I'd gone another way.
I made you a smoothie from the last of that Porsche guy.
- I thought I finished him.
- Nope.
I found a bag of his face behind the ice cream.
- I am not gonna miss this.
- Thanks.
Honey, if Dr. Wolf can't cure me and I lose my mind like that man in West Virginia, we might have to make some tough decisions.
- She's gonna help you.
- Right.
But if she can't, we need a plan.
The plan is, after you're better we fly to Maui to celebrate.
Or I keep getting worse, and before I do something horrible I need you to kill me.
I like my plan better.
Uses up our credit card miles before they expire.
Look, I know these are tough things to discuss, but we have to talk about them, okay?
It doesn't have to be heavy.
We can make a game out of it, like "Fuck, Marry, Kill".
Which is something we stopped playing 20 years ago, when you chose not to kill or marry my brother.
Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna fuck the Charmin guy or the Unabomber.
So, babe how would you do it?
- I don't know.
- No, come on.
Tell me.
- I I don't know.
- It's fine.
Just tell me how.
Fine.
I'd bash your brains in with a baseball bat.
Oh, my God, are you serious?
You'd kill me with a bat?
I didn't want to play!
And bash my brains in, that is so angry.
Where is that coming from?
I don't know.
That's how they kill the undead in movies.
- Yeah, but I'm your wife.
You love me.
- Okay, what's the right answer?
You kiss me on the lips, and then place a silk pillow over my face and shoot me through the temple with a pearl-handled revolver.
You still end up in the same place.
Yeah, but my way is romantic.
Your way is how a gangster kills a stool pigeon.
That's Dr. Wolf.
Did you put out the fancy soaps?
Oh, if I didn't, are you gonna bash my brains in?
Oh, good, that's not gonna be a thing.
This is it.
Are you ready?
I am.
Dr. Wolf, I'm Joel Hammond.
And this is my wife Sheila.
I'm so glad to finally meet you.
Me too.
I'm sorry.
I haven't hugged anyone in a while.
Am I doing it correctly?
Does this feel more natural?
This is too high, obviously.
- Well, I think your first try felt best.
- Hmm.
Enough of this emotional nonsense.
- Who's this?
- I'm Joel.
You can call him "Slugger".
Jesus Christ.
Blood pressure is zero over zero.
Perfect.
You could not be more dead.
Do you have any idea how I got this way?
Well, I've only seen one other case but it might be anything.
The resurgence of an ancient plague, a mutation of the rabies virus.
I could speculate further, but it would be as pointless as trying to observe cold fusion from the electrolysis of heavy water on a palladium electrode.
Can you imagine?
She's really funny.
I'm a big fan of your inhalers.
Your use of nanoparticles to produce lower oropharyngeal deposition is divine.
Oh, that's very sweet.
Dr. Wolf, it's an honor to have you stay with us.
If you feel at all self-conscious about kicking me out of my room, it would be an equal honor to let you sleep on the fold-out couch in the garage.
You're trying to trick me.
I hate that.
It's why I will not go to magic shows.
- Does that hurt?
- No.
Oh, God!
Warn people.
How about now?
A little tickle, like I have a frog in my throat.
I don't believe it.
I'm finally holding the ancient Serbian Fuck, how is that helping?
I could ask the same thing about your girlish hysteria.
I was checking her brain stem to see if her autonomic nervous system was still functioning.
Have you shown any signs of unprovoked aggression?
Unprovoked?
No.
Everyone I killed had it coming.
Good.
Then it's not too late.
Now why don't you put down the only known copy of that priceless book, ideally away from the chips and Safeway brand guacamole.
This is amazing.
Something written 500 years ago is going to help me.
And here is the remedy.
It's taken me years to find the modern-day equivalent of these medieval Serbian ingredients.
You can't just run down to the store and get myrrh.
But I've tested the formula and it works.
Thank God it works.
It's all here.
This is gonna change our lives.
Look at it.
It's so beautiful.
Oops.
I'm beginning to think I'll never unfreeze my eggs.
I'll stay here in your brown tract home for a few days while I adapt the solution I've used on rats into a human-grade injection.
So, how soon after the injection will I be cured?
- Never.
- But you said it works.
Always.
You're mad about the guacamole.
Yes.
But my point is, it's not a cure.
You're dead and you're gonna stay that way.
All we can do is halt your deterioration so you'll remain as you are now.
So she'll never be like the way she was before, ever?
I'm afraid not.
Well, that's a shame.
I know it's not exactly what you wanted to hear, but it's mostly good news.
I'm not getting better but I'm not gonna get worse.
It's definitely a glass-half-full situation.
We're still gonna have to kill people, but I'm not gonna have to find a lovely way to kill you, which was causing tension in the relationship.
It was.
I left open that box of crackers you love so much just so they'd get stale.
I feel like being undead has made you more vindictive.
It's made me more everything.
That's what I like about it.
It's made me more confident, fearless.
Last week I told Susan, "Stop being such a little bitch.
If you want that townhouse, then just make an offer".
I'd have never been able to talk to a city councilwoman like that before.
And I enjoy sex more, and don't care as much about foreplay.
That's certainly a good thing.
Mmm.
Ow, ow.
My lip.
Ah.
- Sorry.
You just make me so fucking hot.
- Mmm.
Ooh.
Ow, ow, ow!
Ow!
Oh.
Ow!
Hey.
Uh-oh.
Did you break the skin?
- No.
- Good.
Has she ever hurt you before in the act of passion?
No.
We're not into that.
We're licensed real estate brokers.
It definitely sounds like unprovoked aggression.
You may be entering a new, more feral stage.
How long before I completely lose control?
I'm not sure.
All I know is it'll be a progression, starting with "That was a little rude" - and ending with "Run"!
- Okay.
We need to move up the timeline.
When can you be ready?
Oh, damn it.
I can have everything here in two days, except for the bile.
The bile?
The book calls for the bile of a native-born pure Serbian.
Really?
Does it also call for the whisker of an Irishman?
It's effective because medieval Serbians developed intestinal flora that resisted the virus.
Unfortunately, my bile guy, VladÃ©, is on vacation.
Couldn't you just tell VladÃ© it's an emergency?
Ah, he won't care.
He's more reliable than my last bile guy, but the digestive fluid business attracts more hobbyists than professionals.
- The baka.
- The baka?
The baka!
The grandmother of Abby's school principal.
She told me both her parents are Serbian and exactly how they died.
And then she made me touch locks of their hair.
Long afternoon.
Great.
Tomorrow I'll prep the formula while you two collect her bile.
Hopefully this will work.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You said it always works.
On rats.
I've only ever done it on rats.
And even then, it's only effective if it's administered before they've gone completely feral.
So there's not a cure, and the partial cure might not even work because we're too late, and Sheila's not a rat.
But the good news is I get to make an elderly woman throw up in a bucket, which might be a turn-on for some people, but it's not my thing.
Yet!
Who knows?
The night is young!
- He seems angry.
- I know, right?
His plan B is to bash my brains in with a baseball bat.
I wouldn't even do that to the rats.
If I have to put them down, I dim the lights, play Mozart, get them high on nitrous oxide, and then drive a tiny, mint-flavored toothpick into their brains.
You see?
I've known you, what, five minutes and already I'd rather have you kill me.
Thank you.
- Have you?
- Sterilized the cerebral spinal fluid?
- Yes.
- Perhaps you should Fractionally distill the crude reaction mixture?
Done.
- Have the - Crystals formed?
No.
- I wonder - Nine point three.
- But I - Blue.
- Why?
- Seven.
Interesting.
Hey, guys.
I'm ready to help.
Um, would you like to chop this table in half?
I don't have a lab coat.
Look, I know we got off to a bad start with the whole guacamole thing, but everyone has something cool to do except me.
Let me ask you this, Abby-san Obviously, this was a mistake.
Do you have any knowledge of neuroscience?
I get straight A's in everything except science.
- Are you good at taking notes?
- Yes.
Take this down, verbatim.
I'd like a turkey sandwich on whole wheat, no mayo.
Then run to the Rite Aid, get me a bag of raw cashews, a bar of free-trade dark chocolate, and three postcards with the Hollywood sign on them.
I have nieces.
Thank you for entrusting me with this super-exciting assignment.
Oh, Abby, wait.
Could you get me a roast beef on nothing, 'cause I respect you and don't want anything.
I'm still not convinced that getting an old woman drunk is the best way to do this.
We are not taking her to Magic Mountain.
People throw up on those roller coasters all the time.
How are we supposed to collect her vomit?
Strap a bucket to her face like a horse?
No one would care.
The last time I was there, I saw a baby wearing an outfit that said, "My parents fucked nine months ago and all I got was this lousy T-shirt".
Fact: liquor is the best and least suspicious way to get someone to throw up.
Fact: I hate when you do the fact thing, especially when it's not a fact.
Accurate statement: I know she drinks, 'cause last time I was here she did shots at 10 a.m. And, objective truth: you don't have blood, so you don't feel alcohol, therefore you can outdrink her.
So, strongly held opinion: this is what we should do, because, crossing a line, your idea is stupid.
You know, I was thinking if it comes to it, maybe I'll have my sister kill me.
Kathy?
That's crazy.
Well, it just seems like this is really stressing you out.
Maybe it's easier for everybody.
First of all, Kathy's gonna be 40 minutes late killing you.
And she'll probably ask for money before she does it.
And I don't know what she can grip with those fingernails.
Certainly not a baseball bat.
Hi!
You man who bring nice box.
That's right!
This is my wife, Sheila.
And we brought you another gift to thank you for helping us translate those prints.
- Your wife has nice box?
- This guy likes it.
We brought you a wonderful bucket.
Nice.
We also got a few bottles of that Serbian liquor you like.
Maraska.
We drink.
- Can I help you?
- What?
My manager noticed that you've been staring at the snacks for, like, a really long time.
It's just my mom has this illness.
And, um, there's this doctor who's trying to save her and she's given everyone exciting stuff to do except me.
Is excitement important?
I thought so.
But maybe you're right.
Maybe it isn't.
My mom's sick.
That's what I need to be focused on.
I should be helping other people.
And maybe I should, too.
Like, lately, I've been doing crazier and crazier stuff and I'm never satisfied.
And maybe that's because I'm only thinking about myself.
Like with this doctor, she's in town to save my mom's life and all I can think about is she's taken my bedroom.
- So, did you want something?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I do, Ramona.
I want to be more selfless.
Okay.
You make it sound so easy.
Sometimes I see things other people don't.
This should be in aisle five.
Why you no drink?
Oh, I don't want you to take advantage of me, Mrs. Bakavic.
- Down the hatch.
- Stop!
What are you people doing here?
Principal Novak.
Why aren't you at school?
I'm taking a mental health day, which my therapist tells me is nothing to be ashamed of.
- My grandson has weak mind.
- Baka, you're drunk.
It's before noon.
Last week you got so drunk that you threw up.
- She threw up?
- Exactly how many drinks did that take?
So we know when to stop.
I want you people out of here.
I am calling the police.
- No.
My house.
They stay.
You go.
- I'm not leaving.
They bring me bucket.
You bring shame.
He dance in bathroom by himself.
You are a terrible roommate.
And your food is too oily.
You have a beautiful family.
To the baka's family!
No.
I finish.
Oh, really?
God, I'm just getting started.
I guess American women are better drinkers than Serbian women.
American women only good at one thing: boo-hoo about sex with boss.
- I going to be sick.
- Oh, my God, we brought a bucket.
Shit!
Now what?
I have an idea.
We're not bringing her to Magic Mountain.
Then let's bring Magic Mountain to her.
All right, I've synthesized the dioxatrope and lithium salts, - which is the first stage of the remedy.
- Fuck yeah!
Sorry.
This is kinda like my Super Bowl.
Here's your stuff.
I actually had a life-changing experience in Rite Aid, believe it or not.
Hmm.
Not.
I'm uncertain this first stage is safe for anything bigger than a rat.
What are the risks?
If I've overestimated, it could cause dangerous convulsions.
But there's no safe way to test it.
But since Mrs. Hammond's dead, if we guess wrong she could be stuck in a convulsive state forever.
Exactly.
- Holy shit!
- What are you doing?
Something selfless.
I'm testing it to make sure it's safe for my mom.
Are you insane?
How do you feel?
- Like a good person.
- You shouldn't have done that.
Eric, I'm fine.
Really, I'm fine.
I just just - Oh, God.
She's convulsing.
Abby?
- Don't let her bite her tongue.
- I'll get my medical bag.
- Abby?
Oh, don't grab the bag.
I was kidding, I'm fine.
You scared the crap out of me.
- That wasn't funny, Abby.
- Oh, it was a little funny.
Look, just 'cause I'm being selfless doesn't mean I'm not gonna get back at you for sending me to get snacks when it's my mom who's sick and And - Dr. Wolf, what's happening?
- Eric, grab my medical bag.
- Again, kidding.
Totally fine.
- God, Abby.
- You trying to give me a heart attack?
- I suspected that one was fake.
I'm not a genius like you guys, but wouldn't it take a second for my blood to get to my brain and Whoa.
- What's wrong?
- What is this, seriously?
- Seriously, what's happening?
- Abby!
Abby!
- The toxins have reached her brain.
- Uh, no.
No, they haven't.
Motherfucker!
- Oh, my God.
- Abby?
Abby, can you hear me?
- Yeah, what?
- I hate you so much right now.
Your commitment is outstanding.
What won't we do?
I don't wear fur, and I won't eat people's buttholes.
Yeah, we're great.
They should name a street after us.
Switch.
Is the Kramers' fiesta pool party tonight?
Yes, Wendy said they were getting a margarita fountain.
I'm so glad we're doing this instead.
- Honey?
- Hmm?
Do you resent me?
What?
It's just with the whole bashing-my-brains-in-with-a-bat thing, and then calling my excellent Magic Mountain idea stupid, and now missing the fiesta I think you resent me.
I don't resent you.
I just want to get a bucket of Serbian vomit and go home.
Maybe she has to be awake to throw up.
Fine.
I'll go make some coffee.
Admit it!
You resent me because I ruined our lives!
Sheila, get off of me!
You're mad that you're not at the Kramers' party.
Admit it.
Honey, stop.
You're starting to go feral.
We're never gonna get to go to Maui again without killing someone, which means it's gonna be a working vacation.
With technology, every vacation's a working vacation these days.
Oh, my God.
Whoa.
Huh.
Oh!
Prague Castle!
Another place we'll never go!
Come on, I've ruined date night because when we go to a restaurant the only thing I can eat is the chef.
We're saving a lot of money not eating out.
Shit!
Hello, man with nice box.
Oh, look who's up.
Help me.
Look, I just don't want your resentment to build up and come out in an inappropriate way.
You see the irony in that, right?
All right.
I am angry.
I don't like killing people and stuffing them into freezers, and throwing away my Pumas I just broke in because they got brain on them.
The thing that kept me going was that one day our lives would get back to normal.
But now that's gone!
And I don't know if I can keep doing this.
But I'm gonna try.
'Cause I know I'll never do this.
I'm so sorry I attacked you.
I'm gonna try super hard to never let that happen again.
I'd like that.
I'll always do whatever I can to make us work.
Sheriff's department.
Shit!
Novak must've called the police.
Oh, God.
Let's get out of here.
I going to be sick.
You go.
We're so close.
Everything all right in there, ma'am?
- I don't wanna leave you.
- You have to.
You attacked me for not being emotionally available.
Imagine what you'd do to a cop.
Ma'am, open the door.
I'll meet you at home.
Go.
Ma'am.
Vomit.
Please.
I just want your vomit.
Sir, I need you to step away from the woman.
Just give me two minutes.
Dr. Wolf says it's critical!
Her bile guy's on vacation!
Jesus!
- Did you get the bile?
- Not yet.
Your shirt's torn.
What happened?
Honey, I need you to do something for me.
Chain Mommy in the basement.
Every marriage has its challenges.
Mine's no different.
Sheila and I have been together 25 years.
Things were getting a little routine.
Monday movie night, Friday night date night at Japopo's.
The food wasn't great stay away from the clams.
Japopo's: J-A-P-O-P-O apostrophe S. Anyway, a few weeks ago, things started getting a little crazy.
I won't bore you with the details, but trust me, really crazy.
And that was hard.
Not just for me.
For the whole family.
- You can't just leave.
- I'm sorry.
There's no bile, we just got a call your father's been arrested, and I can't be here if the police come because I'm the president of a biotech company and there are chunks of people in your freezer.
What am I supposed to do?
You're a brave, resourceful girl, Abby.
I saw that today.
You'll be okay.
I've left you all my equipment and the book.
I want it back, so don't treat it like a placemat at Chili's.
Do I miss the way things were?
Sometimes.
But there's so much more to my marriage now.
Sheila pushes me to do things, to open up.
It's really exciting, man.
When I look back at my life just three weeks ago I think maybe I was the dead one.
Ha!
I was the dead one.
Sure, sometimes the excitement gets a little out of hand.
I got tased, that's cool.
But the rest of the time, and believe me when I tell you Hey, guys.
we're just like any other normal Santa Clarita family.
Okay, that's wrong.
Hello, we are interested in hosting a pure Serbian exchange student.
Do you have one we could get this week?
Hello.
The listing on Summervale?
Oh, it's a beautiful property.
Great location, new kitchen, marble countertops, detached bonus room.
Ooh.
Tomorrow's not great for me or my husband.
But hopefully next week one of us will be free.
