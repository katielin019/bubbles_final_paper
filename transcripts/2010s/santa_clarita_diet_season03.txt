{START OF EPISODE 1}
1      Please.
I'm just a farmer.
I have done nothing.
Is he well restrained?
Yes, Colonel.
Did you double check?
Yes, Colonel.
I've been searching for you for so long.
You look so human.
Please I have a family.
Then we have something in common.
The only difference is you'll never see yours again.
Did you clean these?
I'm kidding.
I beg you.
Don't hurt me.
We both know you can't be hurt.
What happens now?
What are you going to do to me?
No blood.
I found one!
I'm not a monster.
Please don't kill me.
I wouldn't dream of killing you.
We're going to spend years in this lab together.
Vlado?
Yes, Colonel?
You didn't check the restraints, did you?
I could check them now.
Yes?
I know.
I wanted to kill Vlado weeks ago.
Different Vlado.
But But I'll find another undead.
Transfer?
You don't need to transfer I understand.
Where the fuck is Santa Clarita?
Our house in the Middle of our street Our house, in the middle of our Our house, it has a crowd There's always something happening And it's usually quite loud Our mum she's so house-proud Nothing ever slows her down And a mess is not allowed Our house in the Middle of our street Our house in the Middle of our street Our house in the Middle of our street Our house, in the middle of our Good morning, Mr. Ball Legs.
Sorry we almost left town without you yesterday.
Things got a little crazy and we completely forgot.
Don't look at me that way.
I got you a present.
It's a spider with a top hat.
The Broadway version of you.
What's going on, Mr. Ball Legs?
You barely touched your earlobes.
Aren't you hungry?
I'm starving.
So, you drove Gary's head out into the desert and didn't kill him?
Yeah, all good.
He's back in the basement.
Okay, and now Anne thinks Mom is a God?
Not exactly.
She believes your mother was chosen by God to do his work on Earth by killing evil doers.
And then eating them.
She doesn't know about that part.
Anyway we just wanted to loop you in, in case it comes up.
Oh, so we're looping Abby in now?
Because when you guys were going on the run and ditching me in Phoenix with Aunt Cathy, looping me in about my whole goddamn future didn't seem like a priority.
You still mad about that?
It was yesterday!
The important thing is we didn't ditch you.
You're welcome.
And no one's on the run.
Things are good.
Life's getting back to normal.
Ramona's mutant spider ball is sick and the Nazi meat rotted.
You're the one who wanted to keep living with us.
I just feel bad for Mr. Ball Legs.
He stopped eating.
It eats?
I think that's what he's doing.
He just sort of scoots back over the food and then it's gone.
Also since I emptied out our freezer when we went out on the run I'm out of food.
Well, just run down to the market and kill somebody.
We'll figure this out.
Look how bad things seemed for us yesterday.
We were about to lose everything.
Today, we just have to kill a Nazi.
And, lucky for us now there are more of them than ever.
Everything is going to be just fine.
Why do you have to say things like that?
There's no one there.
Who are the Knights?
I have no idea.
Fuck me.
According to Google Translate this says there was a group of medieval men called the Knights of Serbia, who were tasked with killing the undead.
Of course they were all men.
Yes.
If we could just go back in time and channelize that gender's hostility to anything different I'm just saying.
Do you think that there are modern-day Knights?
I don't know.
If their duty is to stop the virus from spreading they may be the ones that blew up Ruby's clam farm.
And they may also be looking for me.
- Is your stomach growling?
- I'm hungry.
Okay.
You track down another Nazi.
I need to find out if this Knights of Serbia thing is real.
And see who put this knife in our door because that's curious.
Yeah.
Oh!
I invited Anne over later to talk about our miracle in the desert.
I could ask for her help.
I think we should limit Anne in our lives.
If she realizes that we're killing people for food and not for God she might not like us anymore.
On the other hand, the Bible says, "If God giveth you a minion, use her".
It also says, "Please, baby, don't involve Anne.
You're gonna get us all killed".
You know what would be funny?
Is if misquoting the Bible was the thing we went to hell for.
Hey, dude.
Brought the night vision goggles.
Put it back in your mom's closet.
We'll do it later.
She's still home.
Have you seen this?
It's everywhere.
It says the fracking company is pausing their operation until they find out more about what happened.
That's so cool.
It's pretty fucking cool.
We did that.
- What?
- Nothing.
Just nice to see you this happy.
- Aren't you happy?
- I'm very happy.
Last night was amazing.
You were amazing.
Oh, shucks.
So were you.
Were you scared?
A little.
The whole thing was perfect and you are a fucking master.
Please.
I mean, you did more than your share of the work.
I didn't know something could explode like that.
Was it too much?
It was too much.
It nearly knocked me out of my shoes.
You said go big.
Oh, my God!
You guys did it.
- What?
- I just heard you.
You had sex!
Oh!
Oh, I feel like you maybe misinterpreted.
Then what were you talking about?
Okay.
- You caught us.
We had sex.
- It was lovely and I am proud.
Really?
It went well?
You're kidding me?
This guy Look out.
I won't be denied.
Unless my partner puts out any signal that this is not what she wants and then I will absolutely stop and call an Uber or another ride-sharing app that treats women better.
I am so excited!
Oh, my little baby.
My little baby boy.
And you take care of her needs, right?
Otherwise, you're just a monkey in a jungle.
We're a family without boundaries.
How cool is that?
It's all so incredible.
Why do you think God chose you to do His work?
I don't know.
I mean, he's a great guy, but not much of an explainer.
How's the fruit salad?
It's good, thank you.
Anne, you have to stop testing me.
I'm sorry.
You scratched the table.
That was there before.
No, it wasn't.
I know.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
And I lied about the table.
No wonder God didn't choose me - to do His work.
- Don't be like that.
He loves you.
Just don't fuck with Him.
You didn't say anything to Lisa, right?
- No, I swear.
- Good.
Don't tell anybody.
But I want to spread the word!
You rose from the dead.
You can grant eternal life.
People should know.
I disagree.
People get weird.
You only found out last night and you've already shot me twice and stabbed me with a fork.
Well can I at least help you do His work?
I've always wanted to serve God in a bigger way and now through you, I can.
No, thank you.
Sheila, please don't turn me away.
Well, there is one tiny thing you could do.
I'm trying to smite this Nazi.
- Could you get his address?
- Done.
And a fingerprint off this knife, with no questions asked?
- Okay.
- And while you're out we could use some dish soap and string cheese.
I have a list.
Whatever you need.
Sheila You may not know why this happened but it happened for a reason.
- You think so?
- I'm sure of it.
You have a greater purpose.
You just don't know what it is yet.
But one day, you will.
So, Janko, tell me this.
Would you rather have all your teeth taken out or keep them all but file them into points?
- Points.
- I agree.
Would you rather be attacked by two 15-year-olds or 15 two-year-olds?
Hello.
I'm Roy Eastman.
One moment.
And the two-year-olds have a dog.
Dog for me is a non-issue because I'm good with the dogs.
Although it may make the two-year-olds braver.
Janko.
Vlado.
Can't you see a man has walked in?
How may I help you?
Yes.
I'm a medieval scholar at the local university.
Recently, I've been made aware of an ancient order that may still exist called "The Knights of Serbia".
We know of no such thing.
I believe they were formed hundreds of years ago after an outbreak of a deadly virus in the town of Pozica.
Have any of you heard of Pozica?
- No.
- I don't know.
No.
My name is Dobrivoje Poplovic.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.
Roy.
Roy - Kodak?
- I thought you said the Roy Eastman?
Yeah.
Roy Eastman Kodak.
Well, over the years people with wild imaginations have made up stories about our country.
Fantasies about outbreaks, viruses, people going mad, killing each other.
I can assure you, these things have never happened.
There are no Knights of Serbia.
And if this Pozica exists, it's a town of no significance.
Now if you'll excuse us, this week is the Guca Trumpet Festival, so we're all very busy.
I didn't realize Guca was this week.
I'm kidding, I've never heard of it.
Okay.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Did any of you put a knife in my door this morning?
Of course not.
Trumpet Festival is time of peace.
A clam farm is blown up someone was looking for Serbian bile and now this man comes in.
- I don't think he was medieval scholar.
- No.
You don't lock a face like that up in a library.
Perhaps there is an undead subject in Santa Clarita.
And if so, we need to find it before those meddlesome Knights of Serbia kill it.
I need it alive.
And I need to find out more about this Roy Eastman Kodak.
Those people at the Consulate?
They're obviously hiding something.
That Poplovic guy?
He's like a hotel bellman you find out has been dead for 200 years Jogger.
I wish we could have lured this Nazi to the kill room, like we did with Boone.
I told you.
He said his schedule was too tight this week.
I can't believe he's that busy.
I was surprised too, and then I thought if we also stereotype people by assuming Nazis are always available, are we that much better than them?
Yes.
It's just We bought all the plastic, we're renting the unit.
It's such a waste if we're not going to use it.
Do you ever wonder why this happened to me?
Just to close out my thing maybe we should cancel Showtime and switch to a cheaper toilet paper.
Now, what were you saying?
I was talking to Anne this morning, and full disclosure, she helped me track down this Nazi gentleman.
I thought you tracked him down.
I did.
By asking her to do it.
She's also gonna help us get a print off that knife.
Honey, I thought we agreed you weren't going to ask for Anne's help.
Well, it was really important to her and she could be useful.
She's a smart cop.
She caught us.
The more we bring another person into our lives the more dangerous our lives are going to get.
Or maybe she could bring clarity to our lives.
She thinks that God has a higher purpose for me.
I don't think anything good will come from you believing you're a gift from God.
That came out wrong.
You, my love, are a gift from I know.
And so are you, and everyone else.
I'm not saying I'm more special than anyone else, or doing God's work, but maybe, my life does have a greater purpose.
Something more than just killing people.
Oh, my God.
He's muscular.
He's like a walking protein shake.
I'm complicated.
I wanna be about more than just eating people but I also really enjoy eating people.
Fuck.
And what if Anne becomes disgruntled and turns on us?
Or, going the other way, starts baptizing believers into the Church of Sheila?
Not bad for a girl from the valley.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Larry Tragger?
- Yeah.
We're Jenny and Charles Darwin.
We spoke on the phone about the German memorabilia?
Oh, The Nazi People!
The Nazi People.
That's the name of our company.
Come on in, Darwins.
Because these items are so valuable, before we take them out our insurance company requires us to ask Is there anybody else home?
- Just me.
- Excellent.
Do you have any rooms with a linoleum or tile floor?
- Why?
- Oh, we have some very valuable things and we don't want them to get lost in your carpet.
- Seems a little paranoid.
- Look, Larry We've got a Reichsluftschutzbund first pattern droop wing buckle and an SS-sponsored Grenadier Regiment Drei Deutschland officer's cuff title.
We're not gonna fuck around with your unworkable carpet.
Okay.
I wanted to put linoleum in my kitchen but my Indian landlord wouldn't pay for it.
Those people are the Jews of Southeast Asia.
And let me tell you something else about the Jews - We'll just do it here.
- Great.
Lay it all out.
I gotta use the powder room.
Okay.
Oh, my God!
I am so hot for you right now.
The way you took command with that flawless German.
Where did you learn that?
I figured if we were gonna be running with Nazis, I should do some homework.
See?
We don't need Anne.
You and me, we're the team.
We got this.
It's me.
They're here.
The people who killed Boone, dumbass.
You guys get to my house, I'll make sure they don't leave.
I love night vision goggles.
They take the guesswork out of crime.
Do you remember where they go?
We should put them back exactly the same.
- I don't remember.
- Shit.
But I did take a picture.
Genius.
Damn.
That's it.
Done.
Can it really be this easy to get away with blowing shit up?
I sort of hope not.
I mean, better for us, but not cool, generally.
Oh!
Hey, guys.
- What are you doing?
- We're just looking for you.
Oh, what's up?
Nothing.
What is up with you?
Nothing.
Lisa said you two were out in the desert pretty late last night.
So you guys are together now?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
You see anything odd out there?
- No.
Did you?
- No.
Did you?
- No.
Did you?
- Yeah.
There was a huge explosion.
And a fireball.
Lit up the whole sky.
Was there, really?
Wow.
Yeah, we are just pretty focused on each other.
Isn't that right, Abby?
Yeah, our faces were like this.
- So we didn't see a whole lot.
- No.
I was just focused on you Sweet Stuff.
And I, you Buttercup.
It's new.
We don't have fun pet names for each other yet.
I'm gonna go.
I'll see you both later.
Ah, loud.
Love it, though.
I'm also going to leave.
Okay.
Okay, let's get him on the tarp.
Boom bam bing, and I'll be banging you before Fallon.
We are a good team and I'm gonna bang you before and after Fallon.
Alright.
What do you got?
Oh, lots of good stuff.
Come on over here and take a look.
I'm fine where I am.
The light's better over here.
I can see.
You like power bars?
That's for you.
I'm not getting on your fucking tarp.
In fact, we're all going to stay right where we are.
Whoa Larry!
Some of my buddies have gone missing.
A.J., Boone, Kevin.
You know anything about that?
- Larry, put the gun down.
- Or at least point it at me.
It's very sexist that you're only pointing it at Roy.
No, that was this morning.
Fuck me.
My buddies are on their way over.
We're gonna drive you out to the desert, torture you, and then make you look at each other while we shoot you in the head.
Please, don't sugar coat it.
Stay right where you are.
I'm getting hysterical and I need to be next to Roy.
No, it's not Roy.
Honey, why don't you just go lie down behind the couch?
- Oh, man.
It will be so embarrassing.
- No whispering.
If he shoots you, you'll die.
If he shoots me, I'm fine.
Such a weak move.
What are you doing?
Get back here.
Hey!
Oh, shut up.
You think I like this?
What the fuck?
Get out from there!
And you stop right where you are.
I will shoot you, I swear.
My husband's not looking and you have such a strong physique.
Let's party.
Do you mind if I lick your gun so that I can demonstrate an unhealthy male fantasy of a sexually dangerous woman?
What?
Honey, we gotta get out of here before his friends show  Larry!
Larry!
You boys go around back.
- I love avocado.
- It's my favorite sandwich topping.
- It's so goddamn buttery.
- You bet.
- I feel like we're on first date.
- I know.
What's happening?
We're getting awkward with each other.
- I don't want that.
- Me neither.
Faking a physical relationship - It's so weird.
- So weird.
It's just hard to pretend that I'm into it That I'm not into it.
Did it just get more awkward?
Should I take my sandwich to go?
Okay, listen.
You know I really care about you, right?
Like, more than anyone.
Now it sounds like we're breaking up.
- I know!
- Why don't we pretend to just be like one of those couples that doesn't do public displays of affection?
Sure.
We like each other.
We just don't feel the need to touch all the time.
Yeah.
Hey, lovebirds.
Just dropping off a couple of things for our Sheila.
She thinks my mom's a God.
I'll explain later.
- Cool.
- So, Anne You asked us about last night, but we didn't ask you.
Does the Sheriff's Department have any theories?
About what took you two so long to finally hook up?
But no, our investigation into the fracking site is already over.
Really?
So soon.
- Yep.
- So they Or it could be just one person.
I don't know, I wasn't there - Just get away with it?
- Oh, no.
They won't get away with it.
It's been labeled as eco-terrorism.
So that means the FBI's coming in.
The FBI?
Oh, yeah, they have unlimited resources and they take terrorism very seriously.
Trust me, the FBI is going to find who did this and they're going to send them away for a long time.
Look at you two, holding hands.
You guys are so sweet.
Hey, open the door!
Hey, asshole!
Open the door!
There's three at the back door and two on the side.
- What's should - Call Anne!
Call Anne!
I don't know, honey.
You made such a compelling argument.
Maybe we shouldn't involve her in our thing.
Our thing is gonna be watching each other get shot in the head.
Call her!
But what if one day she becomes disgruntled and turns on us?
- I'll take the chance.
- But years from now, she could be a problem.
Better play it safe.
What are you do The cops are here, man!
Let's go!
Oh, you were fucking with me.
Well played.
I texted her 20 minutes ago.
I knew you'd come around.
So I guess Anne is going to be your disciple.
She can scare off bad guys and help you find your purpose while I'm hiding behind furniture.
It's not gonna be like that.
And this purpose thing is just something I'm thinking about.
- I don't even know if it's real.
- Sweetheart.
If you want to search for more meaning in your life, you should.
And maybe your purpose will be amazing and wonderful and maybe it will include me and maybe it won't.
Oh, honey, is that what you think?
Well, maybe it won't.
But who knows?
Maybe this did happen for a reason.
And I don't want to discourage you from looking for that reason because I'm afraid of getting left behind.
There is nothing more than us.
And I'm never leaving you anywhere.
You are my wuffenloaf which is a German word I just made up for "wonderful, irreplaceable husband".
It's Anne!
Are you guys alright?
Let's get her out of here quick so we can take this gentleman to our freezer.
He's at least two weeks' worth of food.
And I don't care that he used it for hate speech tonight, I'm treating myself to his tongue.
Wow.
That is some Old Testament shit right there.
There's a lot of passion when you're working for you-know-who.
Well, Larry Tragger was a bad dude.
Long history of violence.
I can understand why the Lord would want you to Where's his hand?
I'm sure it's somewhere around here Anyway, thanks, Anne.
If you can make sure the coast is clear, we'll throw him in our car and be on our way.
Oh, it's okay, I'll take him.
- What?
- No way!
Well, yes.
I'll run to the desert tonight and I'll burn the body.
It's no problem.
You don't have to do that.
- We'll take him.
- No, guys!
The Lord brought me to you for a reason, okay?
I'm in law enforcement.
I'm gonna be much better at covering up stuff like this.
- We'll take him.
- No, it's okay, I got it.
Please.
This one's on us.
Is there a reason you don't want me to take the body?
Hard to think of one.
It's a tremendous gesture and you are a gift.
Well Helping Sheila do His work is my gift.
Gives my life meaning.
I got some cleaning stuff in the car.
I'll be right back.
Oh!
And I got a print off that knife from your door.
Guy's got a long record.
I'll send you the file.
Why does everyone want to find meaning in their lives?
Whatever happened to just getting through the fucking day?
Hand me the duffel.
I'm going to swipe a few pieces of candy from this piÃ±ata.
I woke up this morning feeling so positive about today.
And then, someone put a knife on our door.
And now Anne took all your food, and the Nazis are on to us so we gotta find a whole new lobster tank!
It's still better than yesterday, okay?
We're not on the run and we'll find a new group of bad people.
Did you know there're still pirates?
I'm not buying a boat to chase pirates.
Primary caregivers.
Oh, my God, honey.
Look.
Abby's washing a dish.
And you thought this wasn't a good day.
How are you, sweetheart?
Fine.
The highlight of my day.
Everything okay, Abs?
Yeah.
Just tired.
I'm going to go to bed.
Love you, Dad.
Love you too, sweetheart.
Love you, God.
Alright.
Today was better than yesterday.
Let's go upstairs and take a bath and get all slippery with each other.
And I promise tomorrow will be even better.
It's from Anne.
The file on that guy who put the knife in our door.
Whoa.
Him?
Fuck me.
Well, at least Anne came through.
Maybe there's hope for her yet.
Okay, people.
After we met this morning, I spoke to Sheila, and it turns out she doesn't want anyone knowing she's doing God's work.
So we're going to have to keep it tight.
- George?
- I already told my wife.
Okay, well, just don't tell anyone else.
Okay.
- George.
- She may have told her sister.
Okay.
- Lauren?
- When can we meet Sheila?
Oh, I'm not sure.
Not for a while.
But if we can't witness her glory like you did, then how do we know it's real?
Well, you're just gonna have to go on faith for now.
But don't worry.
When the time is right everyone will know the miracle of Sheila.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Nice.
Argh.
Nice.
Oh Somebody's ready for action.
It smells delicious in here.
Did you cut yourself?
Just testing it.
It works.
You brought Mr. Ball Legs home?
Yeah.
I thought maybe a change of scenery would cheer him up.
Maybe he would enjoy Bangkok.
Is that Ramona's ball creature?
Cool.
It's like when we go to the zoo and none of the animals give a fuck.
So I ran into Lisa and she had some big news.
About a certain girl and a certain boy.
Dating.
One of them's named Abby.
You're no fun.
Are you dating Eric?
That is so cute.
Oh, God!
We're not dating.
Whatever you kids call it today.
"Smashing".
Mom!
Never be in public.
It was a stupid misunderstanding.
I can't believe Lisa's telling people.
So, you're not dating?
Or "hooking"?
Oh, my God!
Goodbye!
I don't care if it's not true.
We are not letting this go.
Hmm.
Ready to go deal with your friend - who left a knife in our door?
- Yes.
Let me just grab his address.
And Ron's not my friend.
We just shared a room in a mental hospital, where I told him my deepest secrets and comforted him when he cried.
Oh, shit.
We're friends.
I hope we don't have to kill Ron.
He seems sweet.
People can be sweet and dangerous.
Example, us.
Also, koala bears.
Ding dong!
Outside?
You say "ding dong" outside?
We heard you guys are starting your own realty company.
Big yay.
And we wanted to mark the occasion with a dolce de leche cake.
But they didn't have one, so we got you monkey bread.
- That is so nice.
- So nice.
We know how hard it can be to strike out on your own.
Yeah, we've been there, and we were young when we did it.
We're still young.
Yes, you are.
- No, we are.
- Yes, you are.
Say, while we're here we heard from Judy Humbolt and she said you wanted to list you six-bedroom Mediterranean?
Very high-end.
Good for you.
It's like a couple of ants trying to lift a cornflake.
We just don't want you to waste your time because high-end neighborhoods are kind of our thing.
Why are you smiling, pretty lady?
'Cause I just realized why you came over here and it's flattering.
You're threatened by us.
Oh, yes.
Your monkey bread smells of fear.
We just didn't want to get crushed by us.
Maybe you should be selling the type of home you're more familiar with.
Like your cute little starter here.
We're not gonna get crushed.
We're gonna drag that cornflake back to the colony, stage it with all-white furniture and sell it for 10% above asking.
Yeah.
We are gonna get that listing.
Judy Humbolt and I go way back.
Once at summer camp, she got homesick so I stayed up all night braiding her hair.
Aw I finger-banged her into her first orgasm at her brother's Bar Mitzvah party.
L'chaim, bitches.
Hey, guys!
I'm not liking the body language over here.
Everything alright?
- It's fine.
We were ju - Not talking to you, sir.
This is ridiculous.
Ma'am, why don't you take a seat on the pavement for me?
Are you serious?
Ma'am?
Sheila?
Our friends from Principal Residential thought they could come here and tell us where we can and cannot sell homes.
Well, that doesn't seem right.
This is Officer Garcia.
She's our Sheriff friend.
She has a gun.
I'm an enormous man.
I'm not afraid of her.
Cool.
Why don't I turn off my body cam?
We'll see where this goes.
Stop.
You will not fight.
That is a $1,500 suit.
Yeah.
You're lucky I'm not wearing an outfit like Joel you buy at a grocery store.
Look who's afraid to punch a cop.
We're leaving.
And we're taking back our monkey bread.
Thank you, Anne.
I serve Him by serving you.
The shield of righteousness never falters.
Alrighty.
Okay, I know things aren't perfect with Anne, but you have to admit that was pretty cool.
That was kinda cool.
Christa was so cocky and then she was, like, "Whaa"?
And Chris was all Maybe we should bring Anne to see Ron, and if he's a problem, she could back his ass down.
I don't think that's a good idea.
She's kind of wild card.
She took our Nazi yesterday.
Yeah.
Well, it was her first day on the job.
But, that was terrible.
Can you believe that douchebag spends $1,500 on a suit?
You want to have a $1,500 suit, don't you?
I would wear one.
We have a problem.
Remember when Sven and I went to the fracking site on our date?
Oh, my God.
You're pregnant.
Yes, and it's triplets.
I'm naming them Hey, Idiot and Pay Attention.
- Okay.
- Nothing happened with Sven.
But those pictures we took so I could scout the site?
He just posted them on Instagram.
"Wow, can't believe I was at the fracking site with Abby Hammond days before the terrorist attack".
Hashtag brush with death.
Hashtag makes you think.
Hashtag these colors don't run.
This is bad.
This puts me at the crime scene - taking photos like I'm casing it.
- Which you were.
It would be great if the FBI didn't know that.
We have to get Sven to take these down.
Definitely.
Oh, also, we should get rid of my backpack.
We had the C4 in it so there's probably residue.
I'll do that.
You deal with Sven.
He and I didn't end on the best terms.
Sure.
Want me to rough him up or just talk to him?
Keep in mind I'm only capable of one of those things.
You'll do great.
Hey, speaking of our web of deception Your mom told my parents that we're in a relationship.
What did Joel think?
Yeah, my point is, can you please ask her not to tell anyone else?
It's just I'd like to keep this contained.
Sure, I'll tell her.
Does it make you uncomfortable?
It's not you.
It's just I have so many lies on my plate, I really can't handle another one.
Totally get it.
No worries.
No one but our parents will think we're together.
- Thank you.
- Except my mom already told my grandma.
She wants to give you her ring.
Do you really think Ron could be a Knight of Serbia?
Or maybe he just thinks he is.
Either way, we should be prepared.
Argh.
Fuck this thing.
I told you I'd knit you a cover.
Joel?
Oh!
I was so worried about you.
I was a little worried too, Ron.
- Hi, Sheila.
- Hi, Ron.
Come in.
It's so good to see you guys.
So What brings you here?
Hm The knife you stuck in our door with the note that said, "Beware, the knights are coming".
I didn't stick a knife in your door.
It had your fingerprints on it.
Okay, I did stick a knife in your door.
I wanted to warn you your lives were in danger but I didn't want you to know it was me because I'm the one who put your lives in danger.
Does anyone want tea?
No tea.
What did you do, Ron?
Okay, I met this guy Paul through a paranormal subreddit and I told him What's in the satchel?
Don't worry about that.
You told him Right.
Sorry.
Now all I can think about is the satchel.
Ron!
We need you to focus here.
You got it.
- Ron!
- I'm with you!
Here Look.
It's just a hammer knife in case we have to kill you.
Thank you.
That was going to drive me crazy.
Please, sit.
So This guy Paul.
Yeah.
He has this weird spider-like thing tattooed on his arm.
Mr. Ball Legs.
What's that?
Doesn't matter.
Go on.
Okay.
I can't.
Fine.
When you become undead, you throw up a pod and it eventually turns into an eight-legged creature.
That's Mr. Ball Legs.
Thank you, Sheila.
See?
Is it so hard to include me?
So this Paul Did he say he was a Knight of Serbia?
- Yes.
- Holy shit, they're here.
They started hunting the undead 500 years ago, and now they're here.
Do you know how many there are?
Doesn't seem like a lot.
I think there's just one for each region of the country.
Paul has California, Arizona and the Vegas Strip.
Obviously, the Knights are not immune to gerrymandering.
So what is it like being undead?
Forget that.
What did you tell Paul about us?
Well, your whole life changes.
It's like that moment in The Wizard of Oz when the whole world goes from black and white to color.
Wow.
That sounds wonderful.
Yeah, my life has been pretty gray since my wife died.
We did everything together.
Oh, Ron, I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
So, what is your favorite part about being immortal?
Are you looking forward to living on Mars one day?
Wait.
Immortal?
Yeah You're undead.
So unless someone puts a spike through your head, you're going to live forever.
I haven't thought of that.
Neither did I. That's pretty intense.
You guys, focus!
Paul is trying to kill you!
Right.
What did you tell him about us?
All I said was I know an undead woman But nothing about us specifically.
who's one half of a realtor couple - But not where we live.
- in Santa Clarita.
So, we go to Paul's, see what he knows.
Right.
And then we figure out a way to throw him off his tracks.
You know, so he doesn't kill me.
How do we get him to talk to us?
You could pretend to be a Knight of Serbia visiting from another region.
I could be a Knight.
I did so more tricky legs than anyone at the Renaissance Fair.
You did.
So I'm going to live forever.
That's some shit, right?
Yeah Hard to imagine.
Although, if Paul recognizes us from the clam farm we could both die today.
I could meet my great-grandchildren and their great-grandchildren.
That's so many greats.
What would they even call me?
- Honey we have bigger - How about Bop bop?
Well, you just add a bop to every generation.
Of course, pretty soon I would be Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop.
I don't even know how to think about that.
You're talking centuries from now.
Even if we do survive today, with all the shit coming at us I don't know how we're gonna get through the year.
Whoa.
Well, let's just focus on today, then.
How are we going to get Paul to believe you're a Knight?
Still have those fancy colored pens at home?
Of course.
They're at Bop bop's arts and crafts store.
You're throwing away your backpack?
Yes as people do.
It looks pretty new.
Why are you getting rid of it?
It was asking too many questions.
I know you.
You were in Environmental Club for, like, five minutes.
You're Winter, right?
I saw you at the fundraiser.
You made the lemon squares that were so good Amanda threw her batch down the stairs.
Yeah, people think just 'cause I have a shitty attitude, I can't bake.
People can be more than one thing.
Abraham Lincoln invented the pancake.
If you don't want anyone to find that, you should cut it up or burn it.
My dude.
Saw your Instagram about the fracking site.
Thanks, man.
I'm okay.
Oh, good.
We've all been so worried.
But, hey, listen.
Those pictures put you at the site right before it exploded.
It might look incriminating.
You should probably take them down.
I didn't do anything.
- Might seem like you did.
- But I didn't.
- Might seem - But I didn't.
Mm-hmm We were just there because Abby wanted to take pictures.
Wait.
Is she the one you're worried about?
Abby?
No Do you not want people knowing Abby was there?
Me?
No.
What?
No.
She was acting weird.
At one point, she asked me to move over like she wanted better pictures of the site.
Why would she do that unless Abby and I are dating, okay?
And seeing photos of you two together tears me apart so I need you to take them down.
I'm jealous, Sven.
I hate that I'm like that, but there it is.
I'm a jealous motherfucker.
Okay.
- I get that.
- Wait!
You're dating Abby Hammond?
Shit Yeah.
I mean, shit yeah!
We know that Paul is looking for a realtor couple so - I got it.
- And if he recognizes us - from the clam farm?
- I got it.
Did you really mean what you said before?
That you thought we might not make it through the year?
Our life is precarious.
Every day, we're one mistake away from losing everything.
But every day we're still here, and I think we're getting better and better at this.
Maybe you're just a pessimist.
Or maybe I'm a realist.
I did tell you in college that your Beanie Baby collection would have no value, so you should just take the tags off and have fun.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Are you Paul?
Paul!
There's people here to see you!
- Who are they?
- I don't know!
I'm not your fucking butler!
Come in or whatever.
They're loose in the house now, if you want to come deal with it!
- Hey.
- Hi.
We're Belle and Sebastian.
A brother-sister, doctor-nurse team.
What can I do for you, Doctor?
Why do you assume she's the doctor?
- Why wouldn't he?
- It's just I'm curious what about me says nurse to you.
I don't know.
Kind eyes, upper body strength.
Oh, well then.
Thank you.
Did you two want something?
We're in town visiting from the Midwest and we just wanted to stop by and congratulate the man who blew up that clam farm.
How do you know about that?
Because you and I have something in common.
How's it going?
Oh, my God.
I've never met another Knight of Serbia before.
I mean, I exchanged pie recipes once with a Knight in Florida, but she went paleo and then we lost touch.
Oh, my goodness.
Please, sit.
Have a seat.
Sorry about the mess.
I'm meeting my girlfriend Marsha in Hawaii.
We're going to start a family.
Great news!
Congratulations!
So that's it, then?
You won't be hunting the undead anymore?
No.
I'm hanging up my rocket launcher, which is a good thing because the rockets are stupid expensive and you have to buy them from, like the worst people.
Paul's leaving town to start a family.
How romantic.
Do you see why I'm an optimist, bro?
Tommy, Goddamnit!
You had a moth.
You come into my house and you try to eat my wounds?
Fuck you!
You've met met my unpleasant brother Tommy.
He used to be a sniper in the Army.
But now he's going to take over for me as the new Knight of Serbia.
So the guy who exchanged pie recipes is out and the professional sharpshooter is in.
Yay.
Hey.
So, I cut the backpack into pieces and put the pieces in separate dumpsters.
Smart, right?
- How'd it go with Sven?
- I got him to take down the photos.
And that's the victory we should focus on while I tell you this other really funny thing that happened.
Oh, my God.
I just heard from Emily that you have a boyfriend - and it's this guy.
- Eric.
Oh, my God.
He is in love with you.
Yeah, it's all happening so fast.
Which can be explained.
I want what you have.
- What the hell?
- Sven was getting suspicious.
I had said I was jealous about the pictures to get him to take them down.
But now the whole school thinks we're dating.
So?
Is the idea of being with me that embarrassing to you?
- No!
- Then why are you so upset?
Because it's like all these events keep pushing us together and I'm not ready.
If we ever do get together, I want it to be because both of us choose it.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
"Ever do get together"?
- Eric - No, sorry.
I get it.
And I'm sick of it!
- What?
- We're done.
I'm breaking up with you, Abby.
You're breaking up with me?
I heard they're having problems.
I'm sorry.
I tried to make it work, but I can't be with just one female.
I'm like a blue tongue skink, in that way.
God, I'm going to miss your deep, sexy knowledge of lizards.
Goodbye.
Sorry, y'all had to see that.
Excuse me.
Could you direct me to Principal Novak's office?
Yeah, just down the hall you make a right and then a left Whoa.
You have a gun.
Are you here to arrest him?
Is he the guy who robbed a Starbucks wearing that mascot costume?
I don't know anything about that.
I'm with the FBI.
So tell us about when you blew up the clam farm.
What did you see that night?
I'd heard about an undead woman and I think she was there, running from the explosion.
- No.
- Yeah.
She was a short blonde woman with a taller man.
It was pretty dark out but I'd know them if I saw them again.
Hey I never offered you guys a drink.
Oh!
We're fine, thanks.
So, this undead woman you're looking for What's your plan?
He doesn't have one.
This is the first undead sighting in 50 years and this needle dick's running off to Hawaii.
Because I'm in love and I get to be happy.
And the plan is that you are going to apply yourself for the first time in your life and track this woman down.
Now, we know that she and her husband are realtors in Santa Clarita.
Hey.
We're going to be in town for a little while.
We could help you find this realtor couple.
Yeah.
We could even kill her for you.
Wow.
This plan's really coming together.
No.
You can find her, but I want to shoot the brain out of her skull and then I'm gonna find that freaky little spider thing and I'm gonna keep it as a pet.
It's called a maladragon, dummy.
Which you would know, had you read any of the sacred texts.
And you can't keep it as a pet because they die when you separate them from their host.
Really?
They die?
Okay, we haven't agreed upon a plan.
We'll find the undead woman.
You study up and don't do anything until you hear from us.
And, if you lose interest in the whole project, that's fine, too.
Sweetie?
What?
You call your sister Sweetie?
Yeah.
That's her last name.
Yeah.
I'm married to Ken Sweetie.
Yeah.
What's your problem?
- I don't have a problem.
- Okay, then.
Sweetie?
Mr. Ball Legs is dying 'cause he's not with Ramona.
That is so sad.
Okay, but I don't know if Mr. Ball Legs is our biggest problem right now.
We can't let him die.
I'm going to call Ramona and see if she'll come down from Seattle and get him.
Let's put a pin on the Ramona discussion until we figure out how we're going to find Tommy and undead realtor who isn't you.
Well, what if we make one up?
Ooh, I like it.
I get to pick the name.
Hold on.
Maybe I want to Rosemary Sinclair.
Shit, that's good.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Rosemary Sinclair.
The undead realtor of Santa Clarita.
Wow.
Nice fake website.
I'd buy a house from the Sinclairs.
It's a stock photo.
There's also one of them washing the dog and one of Rosemary getting bad news over the phone.
I found a motel near the airport where we can book a room for Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair.
Great.
Let's tell Tommy they stayed there the night before they skipped town.
Because they heard the Knights of Serbia were closing in on them.
And we confirmed Rosemary's undead because we found body parts in their motel room.
Looks like we're going to make it through another day.
I just got a little overwhelmed sometimes.
I get it.
The last 24 hours, we could have died three different ways.
Four, if we count that left turn you made.
But we're still here.
String a few good days like this together Pretty soon, you make it through the week.
Then the month, then the year.
Then, who knows?
Someday, a stadium of children are singing "Happy Birthday" to Bop bop bop bop bop.
Are you becoming an optimist?
No.
I'm still a realist.
I just like our chances.
It's Anne!
You guys home?
So she just walks into our house now?
I got you a Costco chicken!
Fuck, yeah.
We're in here!
Thank you, Anne.
That was so nice of you.
Sure.
Oh!
And I also took care of your little Chris and Christa problem.
Huh?
I didn't like how they disrespected you.
So I looked them up on the sheriff's database and it turns out they were once convicted of fraud.
And what did you do, Anne?
I leaked it to my friend at the Valley Journal.
She wrote a pretty scathing story about them so they're not gonna be much competition for you anymore.
Oh, and I also got you some barbecue sauce, but it's habanero.
So look out.
I do like the idea of neutering Chris and Christa.
Me too.
But this is kind of extreme.
Wish she would have asked us first.
Definitely.
Although, she means well.
And it is just an article.
I still think we should talk to her Set some boundaries.
- My goodness.
It's her.
- Hello, we're the Randolphs.
I'm George, and this is my wife, Claire.
We've heard of your work and wanted to meet you.
Oh, do you want to sell your house?
Do you want us to sell our house?
Excuse me?
We know Anne from church.
She said we shouldn't contact you, but we just had to witness God's messenger on Earth.
Oh Could you give us a moment?
- Fuck!
- Shit!
Oh, we have to fire Anne.
Yeah before she does any more damage.
Whoa.
I think I found the undead woman.
What?
Realtor couple in Santa Clarita.
He's tall, she's blonde.
Look familiar?
Holy shit!
That's them.
Those are the people from the clam farm, I'm sure of it.
Sleep well, Christa Caldwell, because tomorrow you die.
Really?
You're just jealous.
You didn't say it.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
How's your tea?
Perfect.
Do you like your gift?
It's beautiful.
Are you sure you want to give it away?
Of course.
It's for you.
But I can't take credit.
It was like the Holy Spirit was just flowing through me.
About that I was talking to God yesterday.
Praise Him.
Totes.
Anyway, he thinks you're great.
He loves you.
I mean He loves everybody, but He really loves you.
Absolutely.
But, He also said that He wants to shake things up a bit.
Okay From now on, God wants us to work alone.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry, Joel.
What?
Actually, He meant He wants Joel and me to work alone.
Oh.
Really?
Not to question his infinite wisdom, but Joel?
- Okay.
- I don't understand.
What did I do wrong?
Well, to be honest, He was a little annoyed that you told your church friends about me.
He mentioned that?
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I was just excited.
Totally get it.
I'm exciting.
But, it would be great if you could just unwind that.
Yeah.
Tell everyone it was a lie.
Or a prank.
Or maybe you are on drugs or off drugs.
Maybe you're all just Fix it.
Oh I see what God is doing.
He doesn't want me to stop.
This is just a test of my devotion.
He said it's not.
That's what he'd say if it was a test.
He said you would say that, and it's not.
But your miracles in the desert and and the severed head brought to life.
I can't just deny those experiences to myself or to others.
What?
No.
It's over.
You need to back off and talk to those church people.
With all due respect.
With all due respect, I don't answer to you, Joel.
- I need some time to think about this.
- Wait.
Anne.
Please.
Sheila.
Serving you has changed my life.
I'm just not sure I can give it up.
I thank God every day that I met you.
Joel.
- That did not go well.
- No.
What if she keeps telling people about you?
She's putting our whole family in jeopardy.
I'm sure she'll come around.
But, what if she doesn't?
What do we do then?
I don't know.
- I think you do know.
- No!
I don't wanna think about that.
I just want to give her more time, okay?
Okay.
- What would you like to do with this?
- Well, since we don't have a chapel, the basement.
Ooh, can you take it down there?
I don't wanna see Gary.
He's just gonna ask me to kill him again.
We can't keep avoiding him.
You gave him the serum.
He's gonna be around forever.
Wait.
I didn't give him the serum.
- Yes, you did.
- I thought you gave it to him.
- No, you said you were doing it.
- Are you kidding me?
Yes, it's one of my trademark "I didn't give him the serum" jokes.
Hey, buddy!
Sorry, we haven't hung out lately.
We've been so busy, but we wanted to give you the shot so you don't Oh, my God!
What have we done?
So it's noticeable.
I felt like something was a little off.
Argh I haven't spoken in a few days.
Why does my voice sound different?
There's that chunk of your throat that seems to have fallen into the face.
Could someone put it back in?
Someone could, but not us.
Also, it's not your biggest issue.
There's a serum that stops the undead from deteriorating, which Sheila or I, it's not clear, forgot to give you.
Keep in mind, - the lighting in here is terrible.
- Yeah.
It's just Oh, God!
Oh!
Are you going to be okay, buddy?
I have to be honest.
This is not where I saw myself at 45.
Who's up for killing me?
Whoa.
Pump those breaks.
It leaks when we give you this.
It won't get any worse.
Guys, even if I didn't look like the cover of an Iron Maiden album I wouldn't want to live like this.
Alone.
For all eternity.
Yeah, that does sound awful.
I'll visit you more.
Things have just been crazy.
An ancient order of medieval knights is after us.
People think Sheila's a god.
That shower head broke, so I've been taking baths which is nice, but once I'm in there, I'm in there.
We've been so busy that we haven't even had time to get our new realty company off the ground.
You're starting your own company?
Hammond Realty.
We did get stationery and promotional pens.
Pens?
Have you planned your launch party?
Built the website, formed an LLC that shields your personal assets from litigation?
They're fountain pens.
God, I always wanted to start my own company.
I have got a million ideas.
Give me some stationary and put one of your pens in what's left of my mouth.
- It's our Knight of Serbia friend.
- You should take it.
Oh Hey, Tommy.
I'm glad you called because we have a very promising lead on an undead realtor.
Her name is Rosemary Sinclair and Christa Caldwell?
No, It's not Christa.
But it's not.
But it's not.
Okay, but it's not.
Tommy?
Tommy's going to kill Christa today!
- But it's not!
- He thinks it is.
- But it's not!
- I told him three times.
- But it's not.
- He saw the article Anne planted, and is now convinced that Christa is the undead blonde from the clam farm.
Fucking Anne!
We have to stop Tommy.
I know.
Christa's such a horrible person, but we can't let her die.
No, we can't.
Damn.
How do we stop him?
I don't know, he won't listen to me.
Wow, I'm sorry.
I tried to make a throat-clearing sound, but I think that's one of the parts that fell out of my neck.
Why don't you show Tommy Christa's alive?
Get her to do something an undead person can never do, like eat food, and then send a video of it to him.
- That's a smart idea.
- Yeah, Gary.
Turns out you're not just a pretty face.
Too soon?
You guys know what's going on?
No.
Everyone from Environmental Club got pulled out of class.
Maybe all of our grandmothers died.
Sit, sit, sit.
Sit.
Good morning, Earth.
Yesterday I was approached by FBI Special Agent Tess Rogers.
She is investigating the recent fracking site explosion.
Silence!
The FBI is investigating various individuals and groups as well as this Environmental Club, which is rightfully under suspicion as you have gone on record as being opposed to America's energy independence.
What is it, Leslie?
We're for energy independence.
We're just opposed to poisoning Enough!
You'll all have a chance to talk when the FBI interviews each and every one of you.
- What?
- Uh-huh.
I thought that would get a murmur out of you.
Well, let me tell you this.
I encourage each of you to share whatever observations you have made, of suspicious behavior amongst your fellow environmentalists.
No detail is too small to leave out.
No bond is too strong to be violated.
And I know what you're thinking.
"Hey, Principal Novak.
I ain't no snitch".
But let me tell you this.
There ain't no shame in telling the truth.
Don't worry, we'll be okay.
Nobody knows anything.
Yeah, actually Winter might know a little something.
Winter saw you getting rid of the backpack?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm sorry.
It didn't seem like a big deal.
I didn't want you to freak out.
What if she tells the FBI?
Well, that would be terrible.
No.
You're supposed to say "Don't worry, Eric.
Winter won't tell the FBI.
She saw me throw out the backpack we used to transport explosives".
Don't worry, Eric.
Winter won't I forgot the rest.
- Oh, Jesus.
- We just need to give her a reason not to be suspicious about the backpack, so she doesn't mention it to the FBI.
That's all.
I can't believe this is happening.
Why did we even blow up that fracking site?
It was so stupid.
We were so stupid.
It wasn't stupid.
It worked.
We broke the law, Abby.
And we're a nation of laws.
Law and order.
Order in the court.
- What's happening to you?
- I'm fucking spiraling.
Well That's quite a potato you put together for yourself.
I love "SOUP 'N SALAD 'N SUCH".
You know what I'm gonna do today?
I'm gonna start with such - and work my way back.
- Well, save some room, 'cause Chris and Christa's assistant said they're supposed to be here any minute.
Oh.
I was thinking about Gary.
Did you see how excited he got when he was coming up with ideas for our company?
Yeah, I was thinking about him too.
I know it's crazy, but what if we make him our first employee?
Hook him up with a headset and Alexa.
We wouldn't have to give him health insurance.
Or even a chair.
That'd be nice, but actually I was thinking about something else.
Mm-hmm When he said that he didn't want to live alone forever, I realized neither do I. Sweetheart, that's not going to happen for a long time.
But it is going to happen.
Unless Unless?
You let me bite you.
And we can spend eternity together.
Wow.
I did not expect to be offered immortality at the "SOUP 'N SALAD 'N SUCH".
We'd wait until Abby went off to college, of course.
Whoa, you've really been thinking about this.
I have.
So What do you say, Mr. Hammond?
Will you take this woman to be your wife for the next 1,000 years or so?
Living forever is a lot to think about.
Take your time.
It's a big decision.
But, my darling, with all my heart I do hope you'll say yes.
Chris and Christa are here.
Great.
Let's go save her life so that she can die naturally one day in a tanning bed accident.
Oh, my God!
It's Chris and Christa.
Joel, look.
It's Chris and Christa.
Where?
Oh, my God!
It is.
Hey, guys.
Having some salad?
- Oh, Christ.
These idiots.
- Look what they're wearing.
It's like they've never been in public before.
Nice shirt, loser.
This is a nice shirt.
Let's not do that.
Why don't we eat together instead?
Oh.
I love it.
Why don't you suck our dicks?
I love it.
Seriously, I know we haven't always gotten along.
But, maybe it's time to put that behind us.
We could video each other eating.
That'd be fun.
Oh, that's a great way to reconnect.
- Christa, you eat first.
- Guys!
We know it was your Sheriff friend who planted that story in the Valley Journal, about our fraud conviction.
It turns out we have our own friends who have friends who know friends who have friends who work at the Journal and tell us what's what.
That was a crazy misunderstanding.
We can explain it over lunch.
Oh, we are not eating with you.
In fact, we've lost our appetites.
We have?
We have.
Despite already paying.
At least, have a roll.
No!
We're out of here.
This isn't over.
We're going to make it our business to destroy your new business.
That's right.
We're gonna scold fuck Hammon Realty till it's dead, grind our heels into its balls, and take a shit on its face.
Well, we tried.
Yeah, we really did.
So I guess Christa's gonna die.
She did not want to be a part of the solution.
And it's not like we're killing her.
That's true.
We're just not preventing her from getting killed.
Yeah.
We let people die every day.
We don't run around checking everyone's seatbelts.
Or pull cigarettes out of their mouths.
On the other hand, if we saw a plane hurtling towards someone's house, - wouldn't we warn the people inside?
- What if when we knock on their door, they threaten to make non-consensual love to our skulls?
If it's non-consensual, it wouldn't be love.
Good point, sweetie.
It just seemed important to say.
Well, I guess we just go on with our lives and whatever happens, happens.
I guess so.
- What do you wanna do now?
- I don't know.
Wanna have sex?
Might seem a little disrespectful.
Yeah.
Hand stuff?
Okay.
Let me just grab a coconut water and a power bar.
Can you believe this is the way Anne sees me.
Yeah.
We can't let Tommy kill Christa.
No.
We have to try to stop him.
Unless he's already killed her.
I don't know about this.
We need to give Winter a reason to think throwing the backpack away wasn't suspicious.
Do you have a better idea?
Yeah.
Go back in time and don't blow up a fracking site that could send us to jail for 20 years.
- Thirty.
I looked it up.
- Fuck!
How did I let this happen?
He just found out his dog's pregnant, doesn't like the father.
This whole thing was a huge mistake.
One stupid decision, and now I'm a terrorist.
You didn't have to do it with me.
You volunteered.
If I had let you go alone, you would have blown yourself up.
And for what?
It's not like you were gonna end fracking.
I wanted to try.
I thought you did too.
I'm sorry if you just did it out of obligation.
So am I. There's Winter.
Remember, we're just best friends having fun.
Luckily, my mom forced me to go to acting camp when I was eight and then I went back electively for five more years.
Don't tell Abby.
What are you doing?
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Abby.
Wait a minute.
Weren't you wearing a sweater earlier?
I wonder where it is.
Eric did you throw it away?
I did.
That's payback for my backpack.
Oh, my God.
When did you even take it?
Earlier.
Yeah.
What is happening?
Abby and I are in the middle of a pretty epic war.
Yesterday, I threw out Eric's backpack.
Oh, that's right, you were there.
That was a prank?
We've been throwing each other's stuff away for years.
It started in seventh grade.
Eric tossed my soda before I finished it, and then I threw away his soda.
Then we got into non-soda stuff.
Now we're in clothing and accessories.
I don't get it.
Is the joke that is so not funny that it's funny?
No.
It's funnier than that.
- Oh!
- Whoa!
You got me!
Stay weird, weirdos.
- I think it works.
- Yeah.
Now you don't have to do anything stupid or reckless with me ever again.
You got Tommy.
Tommy!
It's Belle and Sebastian.
Have you killed Christa yet?
No.
Traffic was terrible.
So I stopped for a sandwich.
Great.
Don't kill her.
She's not undead.
Yeah, she is.
My brother ID'ed her from her picture in the paper.
- What if he's wrong?
- Don't worry.
I'm gonna test her first.
See if she'll eat real food.
Got a little potato salad that came with my sandwich.
Um, she's not gonna eat potato salad from a stranger.
Then she's gonna die in 30 minutes.
Ah Google Maps is saying 38 now.
Shit.
We gotta get to Christa's before Tommy does, and make sure she eats his potato salad.
This is gonna suck.
I still wanna save Christa's life, but I hate that they have such a nice house.
You know, if we were both immortal, our prime earning years could go on forever.
We can own this whole block.
I thought you said immortality was a big decision, and you'd be patient with me.
Did I?
That doesn't sound like me.
What if Christa's not home?
What if she's in there right now, being murdered?
Ding dong!
What the hell?
You can't just walk into my house!
Well, we said ding dong.
It's a realtor thing.
No, it's my thing.
And I didn't answer the door because I was meditating in my serenity room and didn't want to deal with poorly dressed a-holes like you.
Wow.
This is with a serenity room.
We're sorry to barge in like this, but it's kind of important and we'd love to loop Chris in.
Is he around?
He's at his swim lesson.
We don't have time to explore it.
Here's the deal.
We have this wonderful new assistant Tommy, and he knows has been bad blood between us, so he came up with this idea to bring you a peace offering.
And he's gonna be delivering it any minute.
Really?
Like a bottle of wine or a spa day?
Actually, it's potato salad.
And it'd be great, if you'd eat it in front of him.
- Get out.
- We hear you.
Not everybody likes potato salad.
Although, those who do, love it.
I'm not eating your fucking assistant's fucking potato salad.
Damn it.
Shit.
He's here.
Which is great, because he is so sweet.
Also, Tommy's super sensitive.
And since we ruined your lunch, he's invested in the idea of food as a peace offering.
I don't care about my assistant's feelings, why would I care about yours?
Because Tommy bravely served our country and we all owe him a debt of gratitude.
That's right!
- He was in Operation Desert Thunder.
- Storm.
He was in Operation Desert Thunderstorm.
- Drop the "Thunder".
- Operation Drop the Thunder.
Desert Storm.
Operation Desert Thunderstorm.
Goddamn it!
Jesus Christ, who cares?
Belle and Sebastian, what are you doing here?
- Peaches and Herb, we came to help you.
- Oh.
Great.
Christa Caldwell.
I brought you some potato salad.
I suggest you eat it, if you can.
I mean if it's that important to you.
Oops!
I dropped it.
I guess you two can lick my ass.
Argh!
What the fuck?
Look!
She's bleeding.
She's bleeding real blood.
Yeah, because you stabbed me, you psycho!
Argh God damn it!
She's alive?
Scatter!
Hey, what the hell?
You can't be nice to a guy for one second, we claimed was a veteran?
Is yours throbbing?
Mine's throbbing.
I don't know what kind of gangster intimidation shit you guys are trying to pull, but Sherry Singleton once poisoned our cat, and we still stayed in the duplex market.
Chris and Christa Caldwell, of Principal Residential, do not back down.
Well, don't fuck with us, because I will eat your son.
What?
Uh, it's an Irish expression.
It means "Block the sun from shining on your crops".
This is a win.
Let's go.
I almost killed a woman.
A live woman.
Because your brother was wrong.
There's no undead in Santa Clarita and I got stabbed.
Three inches over and six inches deeper, - it would have gone into my heart.
-  I know.
I fucked up.
- Do you want me to take a look at it?
- No, don't touch it.
Just go.
Go!
- I got a text from Anne.
- Yeah, what did she say?
She said she's sorry, but she can't deny her faith.
Oh, man.
That means she's gonna keep telling people about you.
She's a good person.
She's my friend.
I know, I know.
You want me to go with you?
No, it should be me.
Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm Special Agent Tess Rogers with the FBI.
I know Principal Novak spoke to you earlier today and told you your environmental club is under investigation and that all of you are under suspicion.
All of you.
Just to be clear none of what he said is true, and I specifically told him not to talk to you at all.
I'm sorry.
You want me to leave?
That would be great, thank you.
You're welcome.
That, children, is a lesson in manners.
So, we're not under investigation?
No, not at all.
I'm just part of a team of agents who are trying to get some information about what happened.
I'll be speaking to each of you individually to see if you've heard anything in a larger environmental community, that could be helpful.
Who knows?
Maybe we'll catch a terrorist together.
And fun fact I am never ever without Skittles.
I saw something.
Really?
What was that?
I saw some giant company coming to my town and inject toxic chemicals into our groundwater.
Chemicals they don't legally even have to tell us about.
Then I saw nobody in charge giving a single fuck, until someone finally said, "Enough is enough, this shit ends now".
I don't know who blew up that fracking site, but even if I did, I wouldn't help you find them.
Because whoever did it isn't a terrorist.
They're a freaking hero.
Somebody's not getting Skittles.
I look forward to talking to all of you over the next few days.
Hey.
Um I was wrong when I said it was a stupid idea.
You're not reckless.
You just don't turn away.
It's one of the best things about you.
Thanks.
What are the other things?
You never settle for a perfectly fine apology.
- And?
- You're relentless.
- And?
- Annoying.
- And?
-  Hey, Sheila.
You wanted to talk to me?
Hi, Anne.
Whoa.
What's with all the tarps?
We're painting.
Oh, yeah, I was going to say.
You're gonna do the kitchen too.
Okay.
Anne, listen.
I know that you believe spreading the word about me is your calling, but I'm begging you to stop.
I can't.
I've been praying on it and the world deserves to know.
Anne, please.
You have a gift.
And I have to share it.
You don't know what you're doing.
Something awful is going to happen.
I'm not worried, Sheila.
I have faith.
You've been touched by God.
No, I haven't!
Okay?
I don't talk to God.
I made it all up.
That's not true.
I know what I saw.
It's a virus, from a clam I ate at Japopo's.
I don't kill bad people to serve God.
I killed them to eat them.
- What?
- Yes, there it is.
I'm not an angel.
I'm just hungry.
And I wish that I hadn't involved you in all of this and I am so sorry I'm not the miracle you want me to be.
But, you are.
God doesn't make mistakes, Sheila.
I know that you think that you just woke up one morning and this random thing happened to you, but that is exactly what a miracle is.
I'll tell my church group that I was wrong, and I will give you the space that you want.
Not because I don't believe in you anymore.
Because you don't believe in yourself yet.
Hey, Gary.
How was your day, Chief?
Uh, not bad.
Two stabbings, but no fatalities.
So, Sheila and I were thinking, we might need an employee.
Maybe a head of sales?
You can't see it, but right now, I am straightening my tie.
Welcome to the team, buddy.
I'll bring you a cigar later to celebrate.
We can see where the smoke comes out.
I bet you I can blow rings out of my cheek hole.
I brought you an Alexa and Try this bad boy on for size.
Oh, my God.
Hammond Realty.
This is Johnny Dollar.
I'd like to help you sell your home.
You're not gonna be Johnny Dollar.
My heart's pretty set on it.
- Um.
Still.
- So, now that I'm hooked up, I'm going to build you a sick website.
I'm going to plan your launch party.
God, I love selling houses.
I could do this forever.
Really?
You'd be fine like this forever.
Something bothering you, Boss?
Sheila wants to bite me so we'll always be together.
Whoa.
Do you want to be undead?
I want to be with her, but killing people and eating them Like, even their butts and stuff?
Oh, but don't worry.
When you're undead, butts will taste like Well, they'll taste like butts, but you'll be way into it.
But you're gonna change in all sorts of ways.
You know, ways that you couldn't even imagine.
That's what I'm worried about.
Your "Id" taking over?
Yeah.
Sheila used to be timid.
Now she's fearless.
Ed Thune was a distinguished colonel who became a crazed killer.
Who knows what I'd become.
It's a tough choice.
If you don't like what you turn into, there's no going back.
So, what are you gonna tell Sheila?
I don't know.
That man with the crossbow is named Tommy.
He's the Knight of Serbia in this area.
Why is Roy Eastman Kodak there?
We believe he is the one in charge.
See how he is screaming and pointing and being mean?
Like a boss.
Not a boss like you.
- You're great.
- The best.
- We're so lucky.
- So lucky.
Where did Roy Eastman Kodak go next?
We followed Tommy.
You follow the one not in charge, whose address you already knew?
I should never have killed Vlado.
What?
My former assistant.
I killed him.
It's nothing.
Where were we?
Oh, yeah.
Find me Roy Eastman Kodak.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Gary did a great job on this flyer.
I love how the "M's" in Hammond are like the roof of a house.
Ah So exciting.
Our first open house as Hammond Realty.
Oh!
Maybe we should have a quickie in the bonus room.
No, there's not enough time.
Maybe after.
But in the rain shower.
- And at peace.
- Hell, yeah.
Mmm That looks so good.
A cookie?
No, your fingers.
I'm so hungry.
Is there no more Larry?
I finished him yesterday.
My last taste of the "Master Race".
Unless Whole Foods decides to start selling Nazis.
God, can you imagine how expensive they'd be?
Although, would be nice to know my Nazis were sustainably raised.
Okay, well we'll find you someone to eat as soon as we close up here.
What about that lady who pretends not to notice when her Great Dane shits on our sidewalk?
Helen?
We can't kill her.
She fell down a well when she was a kid.
Oh, my God!
That's "The little Helen who fell down the well'n how she got down there, no one is tellin'"?
That's her.
Huh Honey, thank you for giving up the rest of your day to help me find someone.
I know you'd rather spend the afternoon unraveling the mysteries of the Serbian Consulate.
You make me sound like one of the Hardy Boys.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to belittle your adventures.
Oh, I did it again, didn't I?
It's just when I met that Mr. Poplovic guy at the Consulate, he acted like he'd never heard of Pozica.
But I dug around online and found a military research facility in Pozica.
And guess who used to run it?
Poplovic.
Why did he lie?
What's he hiding?
I would totally read this book.
I'mma call Tommy.
Now that he's not a danger anymore, I can see if there's anything in his Knights of Serbia files that might be helpful.
You're such a good man.
Doing all this for me.
I don't know how I'd live without you.
Thanks, honey.
Really.
I don't know how I'd live without you.
Have you thought any more about accepting my offer of immortality?
Act now, and I'll throw in a free set of steak knives.
I'm still thinking about it.
Wheels are turning, neurons are firing.
Hypotheticals are being explored.
I know what thinking is, sweetie.
I'm just not there yet.
Hello?
- Hi!
- Hi!
Are we early?
Are you open?
You're right on time.
I'm Sheila.
This is Joel.
I'm Marc.
This is Allison.
Hi, Marc.
Hi, Allison.
This Mediterranean stunner just came on the market.
- May we give you a tour?
- Hello?
May I come in?
- Of course.
- Absolutely.
Joel, why don't you show Marc and Allison the exquisite master suite?
Heated towel rack.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm Trish.
You're Sheila Hammond, aren't you?
I am.
Welcome.
May I give you a tour of the kitchen?
I'm actually just here for your divine guidance.
Oh, hell.
Hey.
Hey.
I got your message.
Your FBI interview is today?
Yeah.
Leslie's having hers right now.
She'll text me when she's out and tell me all the questions so I can prepare.
- Okay, let's talk about our alibi.
- Okay.
So, the night of the fracking site explosion, we were right here playing Settlers of Catan.
- No.
- No, come on.
It's easy to remember.
I had dominion over three terrain hexes, but you were rich in grain and had a port city.
No.
But land control simulation games are my comfort zone.
At some point, they're gonna interview me too, so our alibi needs to be something we can both remember, and I would rather die in prison than learn the rules of this game.
All right.
We were watching a movie, but it has to be on DVD because the FBI can't track that.
- Great.
- I have the Lord of the Rings trilogy, or the instructional DVD that came with my Settlers of Catan expansion pack.
Jesus Christ.
Okay, we were watching Lord of the Rings.
Yes!
So, you know during the prologue when Sauron forged the one ring?
You put on a DVD and I fell asleep immediately.
That's our alibi.
Leslie just got out of her interview.
Mm-hmm Oh, God.
Oh, God, she says the FBI found a footprint at the fracking site.
Okay, don't freak out.
We'll be okay.
We threw out the shoes we wore that night.
Abby, they could still trace our footprint based on our shoe size.
Okay, so we wear shoes to our interviews that are bigger than what we really wear.
That's good.
That's good.
I like that.
Okay, I'll pick some up at Goodwill so they look used.
- What size are you?
- Eight and a half.
Huh.
Okay.
Why?
What are you?
Doesn't matter.
I'll pick some up.
Doesn't matter.
Do we have the same size feet?
I wish.
Your feet are bigger than mine.
- Why are we talking about this?
- I'll drop it.
I better do it across the room, so it doesn't land on your toes.
What's that, baby feet?
I regret initiating this.
- Oh, God.
Leslie again?
- No It's Ramona.
Things have been kind of rough with me lately and I know from my church group how much you inspired Anne, and I thought to myself, "Heck, I could use a little Godly insight".
But didn't Anne tell you that she was wrong about me?
I'm just a realator.
Yeah, she told us.
But, unlike the others, I still have my faith.
Trish, I wish I could help you, but I don't have any special powers.
I can wake up in the middle of the night and tell the time within about 20 minutes of the actual time.
But that's it.
Oh.
Well Maybe I shouldn't have come.
Lots of people get divorced, right?
Fifty percent.
And not everyone gets along with their exes.
No.
That's why they're exes.
Certainly, I'm not the only woman whose husband ridiculed her and made her feel small and not very smart.
And when she finally left him, stole her cat and froze her bank accounts and insisted that she come back because he is the only man who could love somebody like her and she's lost and lonely and starting to think maybe he's right.
Anyway, I'll figure it out.
It was really nice to meet you.
Hang on.
Listen to me.
Fuck that worthless fucking piece of fuck.
You deserve better and you're not going back to him unless it's to kick him in the balls so hard, they dangle out his nostrils.
Wow.
They don't talk like you in the Bible.
I'm okay with that.
Now you need someone to stay with you.
Someone you trust.
Don't say me.
Uh, my coworker, Vicky.
Although, she can be very judgy.
Good.
Call that bitch, Vicky.
By the way, what was the name of your ex-husband?
She's one of Anne's church people.
I don't think we should be encouraging her by killing her ex-husband.
She'll never know it's me.
And I Googled the guy, and he's perfect.
Bob Zekeman.
Three convictions for domestic violence.
A hit-and-run, and he totally destroyed that poor woman's self-esteem.
Plus, he looks so tasty.
Check out that neck.
Mm-hmm What am I looking at?
The Adam's apple?
Ugh.
No.
The sternocleidomastoid muscles.
They're practically falling off the bone.
We really see people differently.
Ramona?
Hi, Sheila.
Hi, Joel.
Jesus!
What are you doing here?
Looking for Mr. Ball Legs.
Sheila texted me he was sick, so I drove down from Seattle.
How'd you get in?
The lock on your side door is broken now.
So where is he?
I keep him in the closet under the stairs, because he freaks Joel out.
He's a mucous-covered peach pit with spindly legs.
And I'm more of a cat person.
Hey, buddy.
Look who's here.
Please don't be dead.
He might not be able to see you, since he has no eyes.
What are you talking about?
He's covered with eyes.
He just keeps them closed, except at night.
Oh, God.
Get it out of here.
Hey, little guy.
I'm back.
You remember me!
Aww, that's so sweet.
Look how happy they are.
It's covered with eyes.
Please don't take him out.
Okay, people eat here.
It's like that video when a soldier comes home and the Golden Retriever goes crazy.
Except the dog is covered with eyes.
You should never go scuba diving.
You'd make a lot of sea creatures feel shitty about themselves.
- Hi, Ramona.
- Hey, Ramona.
Hi, Eric, Abby.
Eric, I want to apologize for trying to kidnap you the last time I was here.
That was wrong of me.
- It happens.
- I mean Does it, though?
Sheila, so where is your Mr. Ball Legs?
Oh, I froze mine before it grew legs, so I don't have one.
That's sad.
I love my little guy.
When we were separated, it was like a part of me was missing.
The ball part.
Really?
You feel a connection to yours?
Oh, yeah.
You should thaw yours out and see.
- Hmm.
Maybe I'm - We're good.
We got Abby.
Great stuff.
And I also missed you, Eric.
Meow, meow, sexy panther purr.
Oh.
It's nice to see you too, Ramona.
Ruff, ruff, dog tail wag.
Well, Sheila and I were in the middle of something important.
And even if we weren't, I'm done with whatever's happening here, so Thank you for taking care of Mr. Ball Legs.
I'm staying at the Golden Ridge Motel, Room 134.
If that's of any interest to anyone.
Cough, wink, Eric.
- Bye, Ramona.
- Nice to see you.
And bye to you, Dr. Ball Legs.
It's a game we sometimes played.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Hmm?
Sure.
Please tell me you're not gonna have sex with your ex-kidnapper.
You have your FBI interview.
Is that not enough danger for one day?
I know.
I think I just got caught up with the idea of being that guy who's had sex more than once.
But, I'll talk to her and let her know it's not happening.
She can be intense.
Do you want backup?
No, no.
I'll shut this down myself.
You go shoe shopping.
Sorry, that sounded really sexist.
You deal with the feds.
I'll share my feelings with Ramona.
Are you sure you can handle her?
Can I handle girl stuff?
No, but I really want to try.
I'm sorry you have to live in the freezer.
I wonder if he dreams.
Could you please just not put him back next to the ice cream?
If you had a ball, we can thaw mine, and they could be friends.
Or they could mate and shoot out spores that destroy the world.
We don't know what these things do.
I know becoming undead seems like an obvious choice, but that's the thing.
For you, it wasn't a choice.
For me, it is.
And once I make that decision, I can never go back.
Go back from feeling incredible every day, forever?
Now, you can't.
Every day with you is already incredible.
Aww I hate that that worked.
So, what do you think of Trish's ex?
Ugh.
You're right.
Bob Zekeman's a total asshole.
Can't believe he stole her cat.
Look how cute they are together.
Aww.
They dressed up for Halloween.
I'm hoping.
- So, are you in?
- Yeah.
Now, how do we lure a raging misogynist to the kill room?
Maybe we tell him there's a woman in there who's posting her opinions on the internet.
- Oh hey, Lisa, now's not - Anne left me.
- What?
- She said something about being in the middle of a spiritual reawakening and needing to have time to reflect, or some bullshit.
All I know is I got dumped.
- Where's your liquor?
- At 11 a.m.?
Why, does it move around during the day?
I'm sorry, Lisa.
It sounds like Anne is on her own path, which is unrelated to anyone else.
I'm just so lonely.
I mean, I thought we were great, and then she just leaves?
Why does this keep happening to me?
I'm hot.
I would hit this.
You should talk to somebody else.
Like a professional.
Ugh.
I don't like therapists.
They're never any fun.
What I need to find is a support group for first-time lesbians, who have been abandoned by Christian law enforcement officers.
I don't know if they have any groups that specific.
Although, that is interesting, honey.
A person with a specific issue might be lured to a place where they think there'll be other people with the same specific issues.
Mm, that is interesting.
It's not that interesting.
No, it is.
Thanks, Lisa.
Look how we helped each other.
How did I help you?
How did you help me?
The very fact that you're asking those questions, is how I know you're gonna be okay.
- What?
- There she is.
Now, when Bob Zekeman gets here, you're going to have to say some pretty ugly things about women to make him feel comfortable.
Are you okay with that?
No.
That's the right answer, right?
It wasn't a test, but you passed.
Maybe we should just hang back.
We didn't say racist things to the Nazis.
We just let them do the talking until you ripped out their throats.
Ah Throats, mmm.
I hope Bob's a smoker.
It tastes like barbecue.
Texas style.
- You're late.
Everything okay?
- Yeah, it's all good.
Put these on.
I mean, they're not exactly what I normally wear to school.
Right.
They won't match size or style of the footprint the FBI found.
- Plus, they were 45 cents at Goodwill.
- Huh.
- So how did it go with Ramona?
- Oh, great.
Yeah.
I said, "Hey, I'm not into this" and she said, "It's all good".
And now she's going back up to Seattle and she loves it up there.
There's an awesome music scene.
She told me about this one band.
God, what was the name?
Snail Assassin?
Rocket Snail?
Snail Babysitter?
I might be wrong about the snail.
- You're lying.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no.
No.
You talk a lot when you lie, and you repeat words.
In this case, "snail" and "no".
Okay, Ramona didn't take my rejection very well.
Fact, she rejected it.
She said she wants me and isn't gonna leave town until I agree to want her, too.
Man, why did you just lie to me?
This is serious.
I don't know.
I rely on you for so much.
You're helping me out with this FBI stuff.
You keep me from freaking out at least three times a day.
I don't want this to be a one-sided friendship.
Oh, my God.
Eric.
Do you have any idea how much I get from you?
I would literally be dead if you weren't in my life.
Really?
You think you'd be dead?
That's so sweet.
So what am I gonna do about Ramona?
We will figure it out.
I promise.
But now, you go to your interview.
I feel like I'm going to school today, but my feet are in court defending the Rosenbergs.
You'll be fine.
Just don't talk too much.
You're wearing the shoes of an older, more confident man.
Let them guide you.
I'll try.
And the band was Snail Glitter.
But they broke up to focus on other projects.
- And they weren't from Seattle.
- Huh.
Is it too sparse?
What other dick horror supports an anti-woman aesthetic?
A "no girls allowed" sign?
- Feels like a kid's tree-house.
- I hear it, too.
Say what you will about the Nazis, at least they had agreed upon iconography.
Hello?
I'm Bob Zekeman.
- Hey!
- Hi!
I got an email about a men's rights group.
Am I in the right place?
Yep.
You're in the men's rights place.
We meet in this storage unit because it's just outside the restraining order zones of all our members.
Why is she here?
I thought there'd be no girls allowed.
I'll tell you why I'm here.
I hate women.
With their higher voices and their neater handwriting.
Oh, I'm sorry, am I going on and on?
Typical woman.
Hate 'em.
Won't you come in and sit?
What's with the plastic?
It's for the group after us.
They're painters.
Yeah, they do a lot of splatter art.
You'll see.
Actually, no, you won't.
What's your story, Bob?
How have you been wronged by Dames?
Oh, Jesus.
Where do I start?
Before everybody gets here, I'm just gonna close the door.
Because I'm cold, because I'm a typical woman.
Bleh.
I'm really glad I'm here.
The world is so unsafe for men right now.
You have no idea.
You know, you can't even help a woman anymore.
You know?
I constantly told my wife what she was doing wrong.
Did she appreciate it?
No.
And when things got heated, who do you think the cops believed?
Her.
Her coworkers.
And one security camera.
I'll tell you, I had the last laugh.
I stole her stupid cat and I renamed it Puss Tard.
Whoa, boy.
You are perfect.
Trish didn't think so.
You know women, they're never satisfied.
No matter how perfect you are, they always want more.
Is that how you feel?
What?
Well, it's just that you do so much for me.
And now I'm asking for even more To be with me forever.
Really?
You want to do this now?
Yeah, lady.
This is our time.
We'll get to you in a minute, Bob.
I promise.
It's not that I don't wanna be with you.
It's about what I might become.
I worked hard to be a good husband and father.
What if all that goes out the window?
I know you.
That's not gonna happen.
But we can't really know that.
Plus, the stuff you have to eat?
Raw organs, smoked throat.
Can we acknowledge it's weird?
Women and their ridiculous diets.
Hey, sweetheart, it doesn't matter if you lose 10 pounds.
You're always gonna look over 30.
Wait your fucking turn, Bob.
So is that it?
My world disgusts you?
Honey, that is not what I meant.
I know you're grossed out by Mr. Ball Legs.
You've never been shy about that.
I try not to take it personally, but it's hard sometimes.
Victim, victim, victim They always play the victim card.
No.
You're right, Bob.
You're the victim here.
I am.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Bob.
Hi, Eric.
Agent Rogers.
Or Tess, if you prefer.
I like the name Tess.
Is that short for something?
What would it be short for?
I don't know.
Tessa, Tessa Marie.
Contessa.
Contessa Marie.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Please, sit.
- Okay.
Don't be nervous.
I just have a few simple questions I'm asking everyone in the Environmental Club.
Is that all right?
Fine by me.
Mind if I put my feet up?
Sure.
It's not my house.
I like to be comfortable.
So, in the days leading up to the explosion, did you hear anyone discussing plans - to destroy the fracking site?
- No.
Are you aware of local groups or individuals who might been involved?
No.
Have you ever been to the fracking site?
No.
So we have a footprint we've linked to the explosion.
- Really?
What size?
- What size?
Oh.
I'm sorry, I wasn't being clear.
It's not a shoeprint.
It's a chemical footprint.
Wow, okay.
Yeah, that was not at all clear.
Chemical footprints are microscopic particles that are put in explosives, so they can be traced.
Well, that's a bit of science I did not know.
The material used at the fracking site was C4.
Specifically from a batch that went missing from the Sheriff's evidence locker from a case your stepfather Dan was working on.
Do you know anything about that missing C4, Eric?
No.
You're not aware of any C4 your stepfather had?
You never saw any?
No, I never saw any C4.
Dan never mentioned anything about C4.
We weren't very close.
Well, we were close in proximity because we lived together.
But some days I'd only C4 him dinner.
See him for dinner.
I'm sorry, I guess I am nervous.
I didn't C4 you being Okay.
I mean, foresee you being interested in Dan.
God dammit.
Let's talk about where you were the night of the explosion.
Okay.
Coming.
Oh, you're not Eric.
Hi, Ramona.
I brought you some things for your drive back to Seattle.
A National Park pass.
An air freshener.
An Eagles CD that my dad should not be playing anymore.
Thanks, but I'm not leaving until Eric agrees to come with me.
I'm not letting you take Eric.
Just so we're clear, is that another gift or are you threatening to kill me?
I think you know.
No, I don't.
I'm not great with social cues.
Seriously?
Just seems kind of obvious.
It's completely different from everything else I brought.
Now I feel like you're shaming me for not being great with social cues.
This is a threat.
Text Eric.
Tell him you understand it's over, then leave town.
Or I will stab you through the head with this knife.
Wow.
You must really be in love with him to come here and risk your life like this.
What?
No, it's No.
It's not He's my friend.
Oh, Abby.
I might not be great at reading people, but even I can see this.
It's okay.
I won't take him.
You win.
I'm not willing to die for Eric, and you are.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'll finish cleaning up, and I'll meet you at home.
There's something I need to do.
Mochi!
You came home!
And you brought Bob's Rolex with you.
Come in.
You booked this room for the week.
My plans changed.
I don't care.
You still have to pay the full amount.
No, I don't.
You're not leaving until I get my money.
Just so we're clear, that was a threat, right?
Whoa!
What the hell is that?
He's my friend.
I let him out to stretch his various legs, because we have a long drive.
You didn't pay the fucking pet deposit.
What's it doing?
Get it off me!
Oh, cool.
Didn't know you could do that.
Honey?
In the kitchen!
I returned Trish's cat and she looked so happy.
I know I'm not divine in the way she thinks, but it felt so good to help her.
What's going on?
I still don't know if I want to be undead, but it is not because any part of you disgusts me.
I love you.
All of you.
I don't want you to ever doubt that.
Happy anniversary.
It's not our anniversary.
Sure, it is.
It's been a month since you died and came back to me.
Oh, my God.
What did you do?
My Mr. Ball Legs?
- Joel!
- I found Abby's old fishtank in the garage, put him in the sun, and a half hour later, he was all, "Where the ladies at"?
Hey, little guy, it's Joel.
- Daddy.
- Joel.
Look how sweet he is.
Isn't it crazy how different he looks - from Ramona's?
- Mm-hmm.
What am I looking at?
- So much more handsome.
- Right.
Thank you.
I love him, and you.
It's Tommy.
I left him a message about looking through his family files.
Hey, Tommy.
Hi, Sebastian.
I looked through some of that stuff.
Did you say that Serbian guy's name was Poplovic?
Yeah.
Did you find something?
Oh, man.
There's some crazy shit going on with him.
I knew it.
You guys gotta see this.
Great.
Can we come down tomorrow?
Tomorrow would be perfect.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1  Come.
Did I leave any of my old People magazines in here?
Yeah, there should be a couple over there.
If you're thinking of killing one of the bachelors, I have some ideas.
I've decided to volunteer for Meals-on-Wheels.
I'm looking for ways to do something positive, something rewarding, something - Hard pass.
- I'm not asking you to do it with me.
No, on this whole conversation.
God!
Who raised you?
It's Eric.
- Don't you wanna talk to him?
- No.
You're here.
We're talking.
I don't want to be rude.
That is not remotely believable.
What's going on?
You didn't take his call last night, either.
Fine.
When I saw Ramona yesterday, she said it's obvious I'm in love with Eric.
Yes, I'm talking to you about my personal life.
Don't get excited or I'll pull the plug.
Go on.
Or don't.
I don't care.
I mean I do love him, but I don't love love him.
But then, I don't know.
Maybe I could, if I gave it a chance.
When did you know you loved Dad?
Well, it was different for us, because I had a huge crush on your dad in high school.
- So you guys had chemistry right away.
- Boy, did we ever.
We were late to everything.
Hey.
And then one night, my dog, Hummer, got loose and we went looking for him and we walked and talked for hours.
And by the time we finally found him, it was four a.m. But I didn't want the night to end.
And I just knew that I loved him.
Well Eric and I have the "we'll always help each other" part, but we're right on time to everything.
Well, it's different.
You guys are starting out as friends, but that doesn't mean you couldn't end up in the same place.
- Huh - What?
That was good, Mom.
I don't know why I'm so mean to you.
I don't know, either.
I'm the best.
Come in.
It's open.
- Hi.
-  Hello.
- I'm Jean.
- Hi!
I'm Sheila from Meals-on-Wheels.
I brought you something yummy.
What a smile.
Aren't you a beautiful breath of fresh air?
Thank you, Jean.
So are you.
I also brought a few magazines.
I thought we could do the celebrity crossword together.
What a sweetheart.
Spending your morning with a housebound lady like me.
You're a saint.
That what you wanna hear?
Does that get you off?
- What?
- Huh?
Whoa.
Okay.
I just came here to help you.
Ah, bullshit.
You're here hoping that if you're nice to a old lady three days a week, you can do whatever the fuck you want the rest of the time without feeling bad about it.
I was told it was only two days a week.
Ah.
- Filtered, right?
- Sure is.
Yeah, it drinks really clean.
So what time is Sheila coming home?
I don't know, Ron.
What's going on?
I just wanted to stop by and apologize to you two for telling that Knight of Serbia that there was an undead woman in Santa Clarita.
That wasn't great.
But it all worked out.
All right.
I'll tell Sheila you stopped by.
I'll wait.
I've got nothing going on.
Well, we do have something going on, so  Oh!
What a morning.
Sheila, you're home.
Ron!
Glad you're back, honey.
We gotta get over to Tommy's, remember?
Yeah, sure.
What is Ron doing here?
I brought you something as an apology.
I thought they'd make a crunchy treat.
Thank you.
What is it?
My baby teeth.
I never trusted the Tooth Fairy.
Sorry, Joel.
I was gonna get you something too, but I don't know what you like.
That's not necessary.
And I like sweets.
Actually, there is another reason I came by.
I know you guys are busy, so I will cut right to the chase.
Goleta, California, 1975.
Trudy and Albert Ruffin decide to have a child.
- You are nowhere near the chase.
- Okay.
When I was a boy of 11, I dreamed of owning a skateboard.
I wanted to ride the halfpipe like my heroes, Nacho Zang, Jimmy "Choo Choo" Martinez.
Oh Larry Wilson.
There's no way we need the names.
My parents got me a skateboard for Christmas and I was too scared to use it.
I've always been scared.
I don't wanna be scared anymore.
I want you to bite me, so I am bold like you and I'm never scared again.
What?
No.
No way.
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ron.
I know you've been through a lot lately, but it's not a good idea.
It's crazy.
Although, funny that some people want to get bitten.
Well, other people need more than 48 hours before making a life-changing decision.
Uh-oh.
Did I touch a nerve?
Wait, does Sheila want you to be undead?
Oh, and you rejected her.
And of course you're upset about that, which puts more pressure on you.
I'm sorry if I caused any problems.
Enjoy my teeth.
We should get going, we're late.
Tommy's got a lot of files on that Poplovic guy.
I wanna make sure - we get through all of them.
- I didn't think I'd be so long.
That Meals-on-Wheels woman is insufferable.
I'd like to put her on wheels and roll her into traffic.
Are you eating Ron's baby teeth?
They're like stale cornets, but I can't stop eating them.
They're exactly like stale cornets.
I'll text Tommy, tell him we're gonna be late.
I hate doing that on such short notice.
Wow.
On such short notice.
Rude.
Come.
- Why haven't you called me back?
- I was going to.
What's up?
The FBI doesn't have a shoe footprint.
They have a chemical footprint from the C4 we used.
And they traced the C4 to my stepdad.
Oh, fuck.
They can do that?
And I just heard from Leslie that Agent Rogers is going to kids' homes and asking more questions.
Oh, fuck!
They can do that?
What if she comes to my house?
The rest - of the C4 is still in my mom's closet.
- Well, get it out of there!
Oh, my God, Abby, that's such a great idea.
I never would have thought of that.
Sorry, sarcasm comes off bitchy from me.
That's awful.
Yes, Abby.
It's the worst thing that's happened today.
- Do you hear it?
- Yes, it's awful.
Okay My mom's home.
I need you to come over and distract her while I get the keys to the closet and get rid of the C4.
Do you think you could do that?
Did that sound sarcastic?
It was supposed to be genuine.
- I've lost all perspective.
- I got it.
Don't worry.
You know where your mom hides the key, right?
- Under the candle.
- Then we will be fine.
And one day we'll laugh about this with our grandchildren.
Our grandchildren?
Our respective grandchildren.
Probably made with other people.
Probably?
- We have to go.
- Right, gotta go.
No!
No!
Maybe Meals-on-Wheels will let me trade Jean in for someone nicer, like a Mother Goose type.
I could work with that.
You could just quit.
Quitting isn't always a bad thing.
Quitting smoking, quitting heroin.
Quitting glue is another one.
I can't quit.
I keep thinking about what Anne said.
Maybe I have been chosen for something greater.
Chosen by God?
I don't know, maybe.
God, the universe, Oprah.
Whatever you wanna call her.
Tommy's in the garage.
I just think we should try to keep things contained.
The bigger our life gets, the more dangerous it becomes.
But, the more meaning it also has.
Yesterday, I helped Trish stay out of an abusive relationship, and got her cat back.
I wanna do more shit like that.
I know, but look what happened with me and Ron.
You help one guy one time at a mental hospital, and suddenly he's in your house, asking to be bitten.
These things can snowball.
Joel, I brought sweets!
I'm sorry if I caused marital discord.
It's hot today.
This isn't an outdoor cake!
Remember, we're Belle and Sebastian.
A brother-sister doctor-nurse team from the Midwest.
Right.
Actually, Sebastian just passed his medical boards, so now he's a doctor, too.
Why does being a nurse bother you so much?
I wanna be a doctor.
What's the big deal?
Hello?
Tommy?
Where is he?
I don't know.
Why are the walls covered in plastic?
Maybe he's a painter.
Kind of reminds me of our kill - Shit!
- Shit!
- Freeze.
- Whoa, Tommy.
I think there's a misunderstanding.
We're just here to look at those files.
There are no files, Belle and Sebastian.
Or should I say Sheila and Joelle?
It's pronounced Joel.
Stop lying to me!
It's you.
You're the realtor couple I've been looking for.
And you're undead.
Tommy, you're making a mistake.
Just like you did with Krista.
Yeah?
If you're not undead have a donut.
I'm allergic to gluten.
They're gluten-free.
I can't eat sugar.
They're sweetened with stevia.
Shit.
Tommy, listen to me.
You only have one bolt in that crossbow.
Use it and you'll kill me, but you won't survive to reload.
This isn't about you, Joelle.
She's undead.
She's a monster and needs to be destroyed.
I'm not a monster.
You eat people.
You're a killing machine.
That's all you are.
That's all you'll ever be.
Then take your best shot.
Daddy!
Hayden!
What are you doing here?
Mommy dropped me off.
It's your weekend.
But you were here last weekend.
We had high tea at the Biltmore.
That was two weekends ago.
Huh What did I do last weekend?
Well, we'd love to stay, but we don't want to traumatize anyone for life, or jeopardize anyone's custody.
This isn't over!
Do you think Tommy followed us?
I doubt it.
He's with his daughter.
By the way, I did not see that guy as father material.
I know.
And he takes her to high tea.
It would be so sweet, if he wasn't trying to murder me.
We're not gonna let that happen.
We have to kill him first.
I don't wanna kill someone who has a daughter.
We have a daughter and he wants to kill you.
And we've had ours longer.
True.
And Abby complimented me on my parenting this morning.
She would really miss me.
I decided.
Maybe if Tommy knew we had a daughter, he wouldn't want to kill you.
Maybe.
"Hey, Tommy.
Just thought you should know we also have a daughter".
"Okay"?
- What does "okay" mean?
- I have no idea.
Okay as in "Okay, you have a daughter, so I won't kill you," or "Okay, you have a daughter, but I'm still going to kill you"?
A lack of clarity is unforgivable.
You know that the the post office used to deliver twice a day?
That's how much this country once valued communication.
I don't think we need mail twice a day.
No.
That's why they stopped.
I'll propose a truce.
From one parent to another.
I hope it works.
He may not trust a monster.
I hate that he said that to you.
That's not what you are.
You know that, right?
I know.
Sheila I know.
"Bro, relax, I'm going to their house at five to handle things".
"How's Hawaii?
Getting lei'd"?
Hawaii?
Did he mean to send this to his brother?
Fuck!
A man is coming to our house at five to kill me.
An ex-sniper who shot a moth with a crossbow, from 15 feet away.
And unlike everybody else we've gone up against, Tommy knows to go for my brain.
Your brain.
That's the only way he can kill you.
If we can protect your brain, you can't be hurt.
That's right.
From the neck down, you can do anything you want with me.
Hmm.
- Did you just go to a sex place?
- I did.
Same.
According to Locksmith Diva, It's impossible to pick that padlock without an $85 lock picking kit available only at locksmithdiva.com.
Make Locks Your Bitch says the same thing.
Only their kit is $130.
We don't have time to wait for a kit anyways.
We gotta to get that C4 out now.
Here's another one, loxlinks.com.
Maybe they have some tips.
Ah - Okay, it's a different kind of locks.
-  Wow, that's a really good price for smoked fish.
- Eric - You're right.
- It's probably not real nova.
- No.
Listen.
That's what the server said.
I know.
So to this day, I'm still not allowed in any Benihana in Southern California.
- Even though you only hurt yourself?
- Well I ruined a lot of food.
- That's the FBI agent.
- Shit!
She's taking her to the bedroom.
Hey, Mom!
Oh, hey, cuties.
This is Special Agent Rogers.
I think you've met my son Eric, and this is his girlfriend, Abby.
Oh!
Yes, right, Abby.
Eric mentioned you were with him the night of the explosion.
- Yup.
- So what brings you to our upstairs hallway?
Well, I heard at the Sheriff's substation Dan had a closet full of police gear and your mom offered to let me take a look.
Cool, cool.
Okay.
So, the closet's right in here.
Let's start a fire.
- I'm not starting a fire.
- Start a fire!
Hang on, Mom!
Don't you need a search warrant?
I mean, we have nothing to hide, but it is in the Bill of Rights, and who are we to question the wisdom of the founding fathers?
Madison, Jefferson - Franklin.
- Hamilton.
Actually, Hamilton was opposed to the Bill of Rights.
Really?
- Oh, yeah, really.
- She doesn't need a search warrant.
She just wants to see what's in Dan's old closet.
I don't mind.
This is it.
Like I said, Dan took everything when he left.
Now, I just keep my jewelry locked in here.
And this is the only place Dan kept things?
I'm looking specifically for C4.
It kind of looks like clay.
Hmm.
I've never seen anything like that.
You mind if I take a quick look around the house?
There's nothing else to see, Agent Rogers.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to be getting to my Pilates class, because I'm newly single and suddenly everyone else is 24.
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
What What just happened?
My mom must have gotten rid of Dan's stuff.
- Why?
Does she know what we did?
- I don't know.
Oh, thank God, we're okay.
By the way what the fuck does it matter what Hamilton thought of the Bill of Rights?
Well, it was an early flash point in the conflict between Federalists and anti-Federalists.
You're right, it doesn't matter.
What did you two do?
I'll tell you what you did.
You blew up that fracking site with Dan's C4.
- How did you - I figured out that you weren't dating.
I wanted to believe it, but I can tell when two people have had sex and you haven't.
Maybe one awkward kiss, though neither of you is to trust.
But that's it.
- Well - So I start thinking why would you lie?
What could you have been doing that night in the desert?
And then Anne told me about the fracking explosion.
- I can explain, I - Save it.
Then she told me the FBI is investigating.
So, to protect you two idiots, I got rid of all of Dan's military crap and his C4.
Mom thank you so much.
Don't thank me.
I don't want you to go to jail, but that does not make what you did okay.
And you.
Do your parents know about this?
No.
You need to go home right now and tell them, or I will.
Okay.
I hate being Serious Mom.
Don't you ever put me in this position again.
You don't like it?
I'm not even sure what it is.
It's an antique diving helmet.
I got it at the army-navy surplus store.
It's impenetrable.
Perfect thing to protect you.
- Huh - Wow I thought it was such a good idea.
Like, I was excited about it the whole drive home.
Oh, sweetie, it is a good idea.
No, you think it's stupid.
I'm putting it on.
I can return it.
- Totally up to you.
-  -  Hey, are you guys home?
- Shit!
Tommy could be here any minute.
Whoa, new pants, Dad?
Your father got me this very nice helmet.
Okay.
I need to talk to you guys about something.
Honey, this is a bad time.
We need you to Eric and I are the ones that blew up the fracking site.
What?
You blew up the fracking site?
How'd you even - We used the C4 found in Dan's closet.
-  Oh, my God!
What were you thinking?
You could have gotten yourself killed.
How could you do something so crazy?
Eric knew what he was doing, and it didn't feel crazy to me.
It It felt important.
Like I was doing something that could actually make a difference.
I understand wanting to make a difference, but it was reckless and what if you had gotten caught?
We didn't.
Although, on the subject of getting caught Oh, Jesus, what?
Nothing.
An FBI agent is investigating, and she's interviewing kids at school and showing up at their homes.
For instance, Eric's, just now.
Fuck!
Abby, that's not nothing.
There is a talking head in our basement, and human teeth in my purse.
We can't have an FBI agent snooping around.
Your mother's right.
You put the whole family at risk.
- Shit!
- What?
Nothing.
You need to go.
- Out the back.
- Hurry.
It's nothing.
Go!
Honey?
You forgot your helmet.
Oh!
Did I?
Thank you.
It's not Tommy.
Hi.
Sheila and Joel Hammond?
I'm Special Agent Rogers with the FBI.
- Hello!
- Hello!
Sorry to come over unannounced like this.
Hope I'm not intruding.
- No.
- Not at all.
Oh.
We're just going to stand in the doorway.
Okay.
Sorry.
How rude.
Come in, please.
Okay, this is fine.
I'm sure Abby told you about the investigation at school?
- Of course.
- Ages ago.
Well, I was just next door and thought if she's home, I could ask her a few questions.
Oh, Abby's not here.
And won't be for several hours.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had company.
Is everything okay?
Tommy!
You old kitchen hound!
This is Special Agent Rogers with the FBI.
- Howdy.
- Hi.
Well I'll get out of your hair.
Wait!
Why don't you stay?
Abby will be home any minute.
I thought you said she'd be several hours?
- Teenagers.
- It's such a hot day.
Why don't we all have ice cream while we wait?
There's pistachio in the freezer.
Not anymore.
Really?
I got that yesterday.
It's been a stressful week.
- It was a quart.
- I know.
There's an excellent creamery over on Marisol, Agent Rogers, if you wanna leave and get yourself a scoop.
We also have fruit.
And I believe there's one taco left.
Ice cream does sound good.
Thank you for the recommendation, Tommy.
I'll catch Abby at school.
Sorry to bother you.
Oh, God!
Tell my daughter I love her!
Open your eyes.
I'm not going to kill you.
- You aren't?
- No.
Despite what you may think, I'm not a monster and I'm not going to leave Hayden without her father.
But you're undead.
So what?
Everybody's something.
Yes, I eat people.
Only bad ones.
I'm also a person with a family.
And like anyone else I'm just trying to survive and get home to them at the end of the day.
She is a wonderful wife, mother, friend.
She volunteers with the elderly.
She once gave away a pizza to a guy at the bottom of the freeway.
A whole pizza?
No, not a whole pizza, but definitely enough for my lunch the next day.
I know you're trying to make the world a better place.
So am I. Wow.
I thought killing the undead was gonna be different.
I thought it'd be more "yeah" and less "aw".
Don't blame yourself.
I thought the same thing when I sat down to eat a quart of ice cream.
This is all my brother's fault.
This was his sacred task, not mine.
I don't even know why I agreed to do this.
God damn it!
I see a man who's trying to get his brother's approval.
But I also see a man who doesn't have to do that anymore.
- Is it me?
- Hell, yeah.
You're capable of great things, Tommy.
But only if you do what you want to do.
Yeah.
Right.
Screw my brother.
I'm gonna live my own life.
I'm going to go to culinary school or sail around the world or become a doula or work in a bird store.
You don't have to decide right now.
You're right.
But I think it's gonna be the bird store.
Cool.
Awesome choice.
Thanks, Sheila.
I'm really glad I met you.
Goodbye, Joelle.
Oh.
I need my crossbow.
- No.
- It was $600.
- No.
- Okay.
We did it!
We're safe!
No more Tommy and I got a free crossbow.
Which you can only play with outside.
Awesome.
Hey.
The way you inspired Tommy and gave Trish hope I don't want you to hold yourself back.
If you wanna help people, go as big as you want.
Thank you.
I was going to anyway, but I love having your support.
- It's Gary.
- He's texting from the basement?
He really mastered that Alexa and iPad.
There's no better time in history to not have a body.
Lisa?
I just wanted to come by and let you know I told my parents everything.
They must be freaking out.
I mean, I was married to Dan.
I've seen it all.
Your parents are not used to this kind of crazy shit.
Yep.
Well, I appreciate what you did.
- And I'm really sorry.
- Abby Honey, you know I adore you.
And I know that you adore my son.
But what you did that night That boy is the center of my world, and if anything ever happened to him, I do not know what I would do.
I need you to promise me that you will never do anything that would take him away from me.
I promise.
I heard a commotion.
Are you guys okay?
We're fine.
A man tried to kill us, but now he's following his dream to sell birds.
So, your text said there was a problem?
Well first, the good news.
We're getting a couple of offers on the house you showed yesterday.
- Ah.
That's great.
- Fantastic.
- And the problem?
- There was an incident.
Earlier today, I heard someone in the kitchen.
I thought it was Joel, so I called out.
And he came downstairs.
It turns out it was your friend, Ron.
He broke into the house to bring you that cake.
- Ron saw you?
- He asked me to bite him.
- Oh, shit!
- I said, "Absolutely not".
- Good.
- Then he told me a joke.
And when I laughed, he stuck his finger in my mouth and punched down on my head like a stapler.
Oh, my God!
You bit Ron?
I'm fine!
Thanks for asking.
Jesus.
Ron.
He's been in and out of mental institutions his whole life, and now he's roaming the streets undead.
It's not great.
But, he's kind of a loner, so maybe he'll keep to himself.
I'm undead!
Lattes for everyone!
Heads up.
Someone made a mess in there.
Give me some of that sugar, baby Give me some of that sugar I don't want your Wine or liquor, babe Your sugar makes me feel better  Your blue eyes And a candy smile Oh, it made me feel Like I was just a little child Stop me, baby Oh, and won't you stay awhile?
Oh, melting in his arms I knew that he was just my style Singing Give me some of that sugar, baby Give me some of that sugar Don't want your wine or liquor, babe Your sugar makes me feel better Give me some of that sugar, baby Give me some of that sugar Take me to your sugar house Let's find a sweetness together  Take me to your sugar house Let's find a sweetness together
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1  Any luck finding Ron?
Oh.
You're eating cake right out of the box.
That's not a good sign.
- I could be celebrating a victory.
- Are you?
No.
He's not at his apartment.
He's not returning my calls.
He's very frustrating.
Although, this cake he left us yesterday is exquisite.
There's a liqueur I can't figure out.
- So what are you gonna do?
- Amaretto.
- No.
-  Shit.
I set n alert for Ron when he posts on social media so I can track him.
Look at this.
"Yesterday celebrating my new beginning.
I am undead!
For real"!
Jesus Christ.
We have to stop him, or he's gonna expose us all.
Then there's Tommy.
He left the Knights of Serbia, but someone's gonna take his place and come looking for you.
And we haven't even dealt with Abby and the fracking site.
I feel like shit's getting away from us.
Kahlua.
There you go.
See?
You're starting to figure things out.
It's not Kahlua.
Oh, baby.
Well, don't worry about things with Abby.
- I'm dealing with it.
- Yeah?
I took her phone away this morning as part of her punishment.
God, I'm so glad I wasn't here.
Oh, she was asleep.
I'm not stupid.
I'm also taking her with me to deliver food to my Meals-on-Wheels woman.
Perfect.
That lady sounded horrible.
Ha!
Suck it, Abby!
That part's not punishment.
Abby wants to make a big impact on the world.
I get that.
But I wanna show her that she can do it in a smaller, less violent way.
Oh That's so much better parenting than my "Suck it, Abby"!
You go see who that is, I'll go talk to our daughter.
Where the fuck is my phone?
Or, I'll go see who that is, and you go talk No take backs.
Damn it.
I'm not giving you your crossbow back.
That's not why I'm here.
I have something you need to know.
I want my crossbow.
What did I just say?
Fine.
We'll put a pin in it.
-  - First thing, I had a really great interview at a bird store, so you might be getting a call as a reference.
You tried to kill my wife yesterday.
It would be great if you didn't mention that.
Would've been great if you didn't try to kill her.
And how much have you told the Knights about Sheila, anyway?
I haven't told them anything, Mister Grumpy.
Here.
I just came to give you this.
It's all the information I have on Sheila.
And when the Knights find my replacement, you do not want that falling into their hands.
Jesus.
So there is gonna be someone else coming for her?
Yeah.
And you tried to take away my crossbow.
It's my crossbow!
Would be if you could find it, but you can't, so it's mine.
Real mature.
Anyway, the Knights are pissed at me about quitting, so they might be trying to cut my arms off for a while.
So I have to lay low.
Tell Sheila I said hi.
Oh.
And if I get that job at the bird store and you guys want a parrot, there's one that keeps screaming, "Fuck you, David," I could get a discount on.
- Hang on.
- $200.
No How would one go about becoming your Knights of Serbia replacement?
Well, Abby was less than excited about the Meals-on-Wheels idea.
It's definitely harder to parent her when she's awake.
What is all this stuff?
Tommy left it all for me.
I'm gonna apply to be his replacement in the Knights of Serbia.
- Really?
- I know it sounds crazy.
But if I'm the knight in this area, I can just keep filing reports saying there's no undead here.
It's the best way to keep you safe.
- Joel - Honey.
With everything going on, I've been feeling a little helpless.
This is a chance for me to do something, take some control.
I was going to say that I think it is a fantastic idea.
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.
And FYI, thinking of you as a knight is really greasing my engine.
Cool.
Mm All I have to do is fill out this application Tommy left and videotape myself doing a series of trials to prove my worthiness.
Mm, you've proven your worthiness on video before.
Then send it to the Grand Knight Prior.
I'd like to send you to my Grand Knight Prior.
Honey, I hate to throw sand in the engine because I love the engine.
It takes me places, but I'm not a knight yet.
There may be other applicants and all of them are gonna want to kill you.
I promise we'll have tons of medieval sex later.
Yeah, we will.
Come on.
Let's go punish Abby by teaching her never to be daring and live obediently in her pen with the other lobotomized sheep.
What is this?
I'm hoping to join an ancient order of knights that hunt the undead so I can protect your mother.
- I wanna do that.
- No!
It could be violent and dangerous, and the exact opposite of what we want for you.
When I was little, you said I could grow up to be anything I wanted, and I want to be someone who gets to use this sweet ass knife.
I mean, come on.
Come on.
Your mother's right.
We don't want you involved in this.
The only tools you'll be using today are patience and empathy.
Agh.
Oh, cool, is this what we're playing with today?
Wait.
Why does Eric get to be a part of this and I don't?
Eric gets to be a part of this 'cause Eric doesn't wanna be a part of it.
Okay, let's go.
It'll be fun.
My Meals-on-Wheels lady could be your link to the Golden Age of radio.
Fuck.
Fuck it.
Let's get this over with.
I know you're not happy about being here, but it's important for you to learn that a simple act of kindness can blow more people away than any bomb ever could.
Were you working on that the whole ride over?
Well, you weren't talking to me.
How long is this gonna take?
We're here to make a connection, which might take time.
Jean can be a little prickly.
Maybe she just doesn't like you.
You can be a little overwhelming.
Really?
Why don't you call me on the phone and tell me that?
Oh, wait.
You can't because you don't have a phone.
You see what I mean?
It's open.
Come in.
Hi, Jean.
Good morning.
Oh!
Who is this pretty girl you brought with you today?
Jean, this is my daughter, Abby.
Hi.
How are you?
Well, I'm better now.
Aren't you a breath of fresh air?
Huh Oh, I guess you were right.
So, Jean, what are you reading?
"So, Jean, what are you reading"?
- What?
- "What"?
I guess it wasn't just me.
Well played.
Lunch looks great today, Jean.
Now, I hope you brought your appetite.
Oh, where?
From the bedroom to this goddamn chair?
Why'd she dragged you over here?
You being punished for something?
Not at all.
I'm just trying to teach Abby how rewarding it can be to help others.
Oh, isn't that great?
I love being a prop in other people's lives.
Why don't we open a window and get you that breath of fresh air you were talking about?
It's stuck.
So what did you do, huh?
Take drugs?
Are you a drug addict?
No, you're a thief.
You have the eyes of a thief.
Jean, honey.
You can say whatever you want about me but not about my daughter.
Okay?
And by the way, my daughter is a thoughtful young woman who has my mother's eyes.
Yeah.
She probably stole them from her while she was sleeping.
- What the fuck is your problem?
- Whoa, Mom!
Nice language.
No wonder your daughter's a mess.
You're lucky I couldn't get that window open, because I'd have balled you up and pushed you out of it.
You know what?
Get out of my house, both of you!
Get out no Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, did you kill her?
No.
Jean!
Did I kill you?
Ah.
Pills!
Which ones?
The round ones, you clot.
They're all round, you turd.
I'm learning so much about kindness today.
Okay.
To be a Knight of Serbia you have to prove your mastery of these tasks.
It's called the Trials of the Ancients.
They're tests of skill and intelligence.
The Serbian text is over 500 years old.
But 100 years ago, someone translated it into English.
Then 97 years ago, someone rewrote that with nicer handwriting.
Then 92 years ago, for our blind friends -  - This is fascinating, but hang on.
- Shit.
- What?
I was hoping it was an alert about this guy Ron I'm trying to find.
But instead, I just didn't get tickets to Hamilton.
Oh, my God, it's amazing.
Goosebumps.
So, the trials.
Right.
Okay, there 12 of them.
This one says you have to dig a murder hole.
What's a murder hole?
Is it like a regular hole?
Hopefully.
It just says it has to be four cubits deep, and you cannot enlist the aid of a serf or oxen.
No problem.
I've been digging so many graves, I'm in the best shape of my life.
I can even eat cake for breakfast.
This is fun.
Uh-huh.
Listen, there's another reason I asked you over today.
- I wanna talk to you about something.
- Anything, man.
Bring it.
Okay.
I know Abby's a strong-willed girl who's around a lot of craziness, but you're a responsible guy.
So, maybe next time she wants to do something like blow up a fracking site, you could be a voice of reason rather than an accomplice.
Oh.
Well, I mean, I tried to stop her, but she was gonna do it anyways.
Then you should have come to us.
As her friend, there are gonna be things you see that we don't.
I know you care about her but I'm just disappointed you didn't step up.
Oh, God.
You're right.
I failed my friend.
And I failed my Joel.
I mean, Joel.
- You, I failed you.
- Wait a minute.
I didn't fail you?
No, you did.
But, I'm thinking Friends.
Ron has friends.
I'll message his online contacts and see if any of 'em know where he is.
Great.
I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.
Me?
No.
I'm stronger than that, Joel.
A lot stronger.
Now let's stop talking about our fucking feelings and do this fucking thing, man.
All right?
Whoo!
Can I hold that for you?
You've done enough already.
Why don't you clean up all the pills you spilled while you were trying to figure out what round means?
Do you wanna sip that water or do you want it all over your lap?
'Cause I can help either way.
Mm-hmm She's got some mouth on her, your mother.
It's the teeth you really have to worry about.
So what are all these pills for?
One of them makes my kidneys work.
One of them makes my heart not stop.
One of them makes me crave potatoes, but I sure hope it does something else.
I would take the potato one recreationally.
Make a night of it.
I also have a disease that supposedly only cats get.
That would explain all your hissing.
Nice.
You remind me of my daughter.
She's also in her 40s.
Nice.
Is this her?
Uh-huh.
- She's beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.
She lives in London.
She's finally going to have a baby.
A little girl.
They've already picked out a name.
Annabelle.
I love that.
That was one of my top choices for this one.
But then, my ex-best friend stole it and gave it to her horse.
When is she due?
In a few months.
I've always wanted to be a grandmother.
My doctor says I won't make it till then.
I'm sorry, Jean.
I don't know how to fix any of that.
Me, neither.
But I could help with your potato craving.
Go get you some French fries?
Oh, that would taste so good after the dog meat your mother brought me.
It was wild caught salmon with a miso glaze, but whatever.
She's all right, that one.
I like her.
I'm sorry you're so sick.
Yeah.
I haven't exactly been the best person in the world.
Universe doesn't owe me any favors.
But I'd give anything to hold my granddaughter just once before I die.
You were right, Jean.
I did start coming here to feel better about myself.
I was hoping to find more purpose.
And did you?
Maybe.
What if I could take your pain away and help you live long enough to meet your granddaughter?
Hi.
I'm Joel Hammond, and I want to be a Knight of Serbia to protect my family, my country, and my species that I love so much.
I will now execute trial number one.
Tumbling man throws sharp object.
In the burning heart Just about to burst - There's a quest for answers -  An unquenchable thirst Again, I'm Joel Hammond.
The unmistakable fire  They call it the beast with two fronts.
I think it's some kind of military tactic?
"Defend your companion while besieged on all sides, as if by the undead or rats roused to hunger".
I don't think I would have thrived in the Middle Ages.
They shit in the streets, Joel.
It was a terrible time.
In the burning heart Just about to burst  There's a quest for answers - An unquenchable thirst -  - In the darkest night -  -  - Rising like a spire  In the burning heart -  - The unmistakable fire  Hey!
No!
Hello, stop that!
Dude!
Maybe they mistranslated this one.
I don't think so.
Why would they want me to stick a pear into a raw chicken?
"With level hand and speed of a gnat".
Maybe it's a recipe for a quick meal before battle.
Although, it takes a while to cook a chicken.
It just doesn't add up.
It could be a metaphor.
The butchered chicken lays no eggs, but the pear tree bears fruit even in winter.
Life inside death and both ultimately consumed by man.
Maybe chickens were smaller and cooked faster back then.
Maybe.
In the burning heart Ready?
Just about to burst - In the burning heart -  Three, two, one Go!
Joel Hammond.
This application's pretty outdated.
There's like five questions trying to trick you into admitting you have leprosy.
"When did you first find out you had leprosy?
Did your father also have leprosy?
In which leper colony do you currently reside"?
Oh, wait.
It says this whole page is for lepers only.
That makes sense.
All righty.
Just a few more questions.
Then I'll scan this, cut together the video, and you can send it off to the Knights.
- Hey, Eric?
- Yes, Joel?
- Thanks for all your help today.
- Of course, Joel.
Listen, I was too hard on you earlier about Abby.
I've been a little stressed lately.
Feeling like things are out of control, but that's not your fault.
You step up for this family all the time.
And believe me, I know how hard it is to keep someone safe who wants to do big things.
It really is.
Being around someone like that is also pretty exciting.
I wouldn't trade it for the world.
Me neither, buddy.
Wild horses, man.
We can't tame 'em.
- How much more of this do you need?
- I'm good.
Okay.
Few more things Um Huh - They want information on Abby.
- Why?
It looks like in order to be a Knight of Serbia, your first born has to swear to become your heir.
So if anything were to happen to you Abby would have to take your place.
Abby?
-  -  Hey, guys.
- Hey, how'd it go?
- Mom fixed me!
Okay, okay.
I did, but fine.
Cling to your sarcasm.
I actually liked Jean.
Watching her was like a MasterClass in getting under Mom's skin.
I could've kept hanging out.
Jean fell asleep while Abby was getting French fries, and I didn't want to wake her, so that's that.
- How'd it go with you guys?
- Mostly okay.
Joel touched me.
Excuse me?
Okay.
I realize how that could be misinterpreted.
I consented.
It's not getting better.
I mean, we had a productive day and then a nice talk, which was capped with a paternal side hug.
Did you get through all the trials?
Yeah.
You wanna see some footage of your dad falling backwards into his own murder hole?
I've been home for 15 seconds.
Why is this the first I'm hearing of this?
So something came up with Jean today.
Turns out she's a lot sicker than I realized.
Oh, that's sad.
I'm glad Abby connected with her.
Yeah, it was great to see.
But I kept wishing there was something more I could do for Jean.
Of course, you must have.
But you did a lot, and not just for Jean.
You showed Abby the importance of an act of kindness.
Exactly.
Because when you're able to help someone, you should do it.
Don't you think?
Right.
Instead of running around doing something impulsive and crazy that could totally fuck up our lives forever.
Yeah.
Dad?
Some guy named Morgan just messaged you.
He says Ron's been at his house all day.
Oh, that's Ron's friend that I reached out to.
This guy's place is right over on Riverview.
The city's planting trees on that street.
Oh.
Well, his property value is about to skyrocket.
Hmm.
Let's get over there and talk to Ron.
I'll get the serum.
And, in case he's already gone feral I'll bring the hammer knife.
And in case Morgan wants to sell his house - some business cards.
- Can I come?
Absolutely not.
Again, this is what we don't want for you.
Yeah.
We'll handle this.
Are you sure you can?
Because I just saw a video of you throwing your arms up and yelling, "Finished," before falling backwards into a hole.
I did that on purpose.
When we play it in reverse, it's gonna look like I can jump super high.
Let's go.
But then you'd be saying "denishif".
Do you guys want some more tea?
The hibiscus is from my grandmother's garden.
It's delicious, but I'm good.
Just wondering where Ron is?
You and me both.
He said he was just gonna move his car.
But that was like a half hour ago.
How's he been acting lately?
Pretty weird.
I mean, he's always been weird, but now he's running around claiming to be undead.
- Undead?
- That's funny.
That's not funny.
He's a very troubled man.
His wife just died a few weeks ago.
No, you're right.
That's not funny.
No, I was just gonna say.
It's terrible.
I am starting to worry.
I wonder if I should call his doctor or the police.
I don't think we need to do that.
Whoa!
Don't leave the room for 30 minutes around this guy.
- He'll call the authorities.
- Yeah.
That's crazy.
Maybe I am overreacting.
You know what?
I'll just call some friends and see if anyone's heard from him.
Do you guys want anything?
- We're good.
- Do you have cookies?
Do I?
Do I?
Let me check.
He offered, and this is usually the time I eat cookies.
I didn't say anything.
Morgan seems nice.
I wonder what kind of cookies he has.
I'm hoping it's mint Milanos.
Are you stress eating again?
Don't worry.
We're gonna find Ron.
It's not about Ron.
Something came up about the Knights of Serbia.
You're not gonna like it.
What is it?
If I'm gonna be a knight, Abby has to swear an oath to replace me if I die.
- Whoa.
- I know.
But I was thinking Tommy quit.
Maybe when Abby's time comes, she could just quit, too.
Although, full disclosure Tommy thinks the Knights wanna cut off his arms.
Well, then, no.
Why are we even talking about this?
'Cause maybe we can make it work.
Figure out a way she can get out of it.
Honey, even if Abby got to keep her arms, she'd never wanna quit.
You saw the way she looked at those weapons, how bad she wants to be a part of this world.
If she swears that oath, she'll be in this forever.
But if we don't let her do it, I won't become a knight and I won't be able to protect you from them.
Joel, I saw a side of Abby today that was beautiful and compassionate.
I want that path for her.
She could be a therapist or a doctor or one of those super insightful hairdressers, where it's not really about the hair.
That's not why you go there.
You're right.
We can't risk her future.
Thank you.
Maybe, we could adopt a full grown man and make him my heir.
No we'll just grow to love him, too.
So no one's heard from Ron, but he left a note on my dry erase board you guys should really take a look at.
That might be Ron.
Might not be.
You guys wanna look at the note?
So, you're not gonna open it?
Fine.
- Hello.
- Abby!
Hi!
You must be Morgan.
I'm Abby, their daughter.
- Hi, Abby.
- What are you doing here?
I brought Morgan cupcakes to thank him for helping us find Ron.
By the way, Dad?
Your laptop pinged and I saw Ron posted something.
He's been at a skate park all day.
What?
Why didn't I get a Oh, there it is.
Didn't you say that Ron was here all day?
You did say that.
Why don't we all have a cupcake?
They smell delicious.
Sure, I'd love one.
I'm really, really hungry.
Shoot.
I just vacuumed in here.
We should eat them all in the kitchen.
I'll go in first and then call you in, one at a time 'cause it's a small kitchen.
Morgan, we're not going into your kitchen.
Abby, go wait for us outside.
- Fuck, no!
- All right.
Let's stay calm.
Wait, nobody move.
Where are my glasses?
Oh, that's right.
I left them in my satchel.
I'll go get them.
And again nobody move.
You know what?
All my life I've been neat and polite, and I'm sick of it.
I'm gonna disembowel all three of you right here on my beautiful hardwood floors.
Morgan, let's talk about this.
Mom!
Shit!
Ah!
Ah!
The pear in the chicken.
Now it makes sense.
Oh, my God, Abby!
You killed him.
He was going to kill you.
You could have just called us You took my phone away.
- You could've used a landline.
- I don't know your number.
You don't know my number?
What's my number?
- Three - No.
Abby this is not what we want for you.
I saved your lives!
You didn't even know this guy was undead until I showed up!
And what about what I want?
I want to be a knight with Dad.
Eric told me.
He has to have an heir.
No.
You're 16.
This has already gone too far.
Shit!
What?
Why was Morgan undead?
If Ron attacked him, why didn't he eat him?
Look.
That's barely a nibble.
Ron only wanted to turn him.
He intentionally spread the virus to someone.
Why would anyone do that?
It could start an undead pandemic.
Yeah.
This complicates a lot of things.
We have to stop him.
Yeah, we do.
- You're not gonna be Knight of Serbia!
- God damn it, Abby!
Like a penny tossed for me I'm busted Chose a man as he jumps From Golden Gate Basic rules are breaking down Darling, I feel broke Don't give me the needle Oh, I can't do it for myself You know my solution Sweet absolution I can't do it for myself For myself
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Would you rather have your nose be a foot long or your foot be a nose long?
That is a good one.
When are you going to turn these into a book?
I told you, I will help with the proposal.
He's coming.
Quick!
Oh!
It arrived.
Wonderful.
Is it assembled properly?
Huh?
Did you double check?
- Yes.
- Not yet.
Yes.
Now, again.
Let's make sure the trip to Los Angeles didn't damage it.
Janko Why don't you sit?
So, how's your search for Mr. Roy Eastman Kodak going?
We went to the last place we saw him, but the realtor lady who lives there Christa Caldwell.
Very mean.
She refused to talk to us.
And threatened our testicles with unspeakable violence.
So you have one encounter with a vulgar woman and you give up?
My research is extremely important.
If there is an undead in Santa Clarita, we need to capture it alive before the Knights of Serbia find it and kill it.
Now, perhaps as your manager.
I'm not motivating you well enough.
So here's something that might encourage you.
It's in this bag, look.
Find me Roy Eastman Kodak.
He will lead me to the undead in Santa Clarita.
Oh, that's so nice.
I know.
It's hot today.
So, where were we?
Oh, the Humboldt property.
Judy's thrilled with the offer, but we've hit a snag with the buyer's credit.
I'll talk to Cheryl over at First National.
Her dog, Levi, likes these high-end rawhide sticks.
I'll send some over.
We'll get this loan back on track.
Look at you.
You are living proof that you don't need feet to kick ass.
Un-living proof.
Okay, next up.
The Hammond Realty launch party.
I got some quotes on that chocolate fountain Joel's all excited about.
Where is Joel, by the way?
Oh, he's out trying to track down Ron.
The little weasel who made me bite him?
I'd love five minutes alone with that guy's ankles.
What's he done now?
Well, Ron turned one of his friends and Joel's worried he might turn more.
And you're not?
No, I am.
Just We don't have all the facts.
Maybe Ron had good reason.
- You don't know, we don't know.
- Sheila.
- Yes?
- Did you turn someone?
- Maybe.
- And Joel doesn't know?
- Nuh-uh - Office drama.
I love it!
If I tell him, he's going to freak.
Even though the woman I turned is a housebound senior and what I did was kind thoughtful and measured.
Unlike Ron, who impulsively turned someone on the first day he was undead.
Right.
Although, you turned me the first day you were undead.
Different circumstances.
Totally!
I'm on your side.
So, when are you going to tell Joel?
I'm waiting for the right moment.
Well, if you wait too long, it stops being something you didn't have a chance to tell him and becomes something you're hiding.
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?
I have a Google alert for when the words "murder" and "Santa Clarita" come up in the same headline, you know, in case it's one of mine.
- And?
- It's one of mine!
- Oh, crap!
-  Honey, I got some great leads on Ron.
I went to the skate park he posted from yesterday.
Met this cool skater kid named Gavin.
Bit of an attitude, but he's got the goods.
He said he saw Ron there yesterday and he'd call me if he shows up again.
That's great.
We framed a woman for murder.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
I should have paused.
That's great.
We framed a woman for murder.
- Why would we do that?
- It was an accident.
You know Trish?
Trish?
We killed her shitty ex-husband and I returned her cat?
Oh!
That ex-husband, cat, Trish.
I didn't do anything, I swear.
I just opened the door and there was a cardboard box.
It was my cat and Bob's Rolex in it.
I I don't know what happened to him.
I didn't kill him, you have to believe me.
Wow, she looks really guilty.
Joel, we killed Bob.
I know.
I'm saying she's presenting all the evidence against her and yelling she didn't kill him, when they don't even have a body.
- I'd convict her.
- Poor Trish.
She's so sweet and she came to me for help and now she's going to jail.
We have to fix this.
Totally.
I'm with you 100%.
Are you?
I'm hearing, like, 60%.
It's just, we need to find Ron.
He intentionally turned someone.
Anyone who'd do that is clearly unhinged and needs to be stopped.
Yes.
His specific form of recklessness is a problem.
What do you mean "specific form"?
I mean specifically running around, turning people left and right.
It's irresponsible.
That's what I'm saying.
So, we agree on the specific thing Ron is doing.
But right now, we're talking about Trish, and I don't want her going to jail over something we did.
Good morning, accomplices.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Morning.
How are you feeling?
Fine.
Fine.
Put those faces away.
Well, you did kill someone yesterday, Abby, and I can't see my face, but it feels like the right one.
So, using more words than "fine," tell us how you are.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
Farewell.
Come on, Abby.
Plus, you have your interview with the FBI today.
You must be feeling something.
It's all under control.
The FBI doesn't have anything on me and Eric.
And that guy I killed was undead and about to eat Dad.
Wait.
Dad, how are you feeling?
I'm fine.
Oh, I see what you're doing.
We just put you in the middle of a lot of craziness.
And if you ever need help with anything we're here.
It's sweet that you guys are still trying to protect me.
Really.
I'm proud of you.
I know she's being condescending, but that felt really good.
We get so little.
Okay.
I was thinking.
- We have Bob's body, right?
- Bob?
Bob.
Trish's ex.
He is in our freezer.
What if we use his body to unframe Trish?
Put it somewhere and make it look like he died in an accident.
Oh So we're putting a pin in my thing, stopping an undead apocalypse and doing your thing, saving one person.
Yes.
Until you hear from Aiden.
- Aiden?
- Your skate park friend?
Gavin.
Aiden had the attitude, but not the skills.
Not quite sure how we make that look like an accident.
What if he got sucked up into a jet engine?
Times have changed since 9/11.
You can't just drive a corpse onto a runway and throw it in a jet engine anymore.
- Another freedom gone forever.
- Yeah.
We could sneak him into the zoo - and toss him in with the lions.
- That's good.
Although, then, we'd be framing an innocent lion.
Yeah, that'd be sad.
Plus, we let our zoo membership lapse.
We should renew that.
I heard they built a new monkey island.
Thank God.
That old one was fucking depressing.
I know.
It was like monkey Alcatraz.
I saw a surf rack on Bob's car.
What if we made it look like he went surfing and got attacked by a shark?
I guess I'm okay framing a shark.
They kill seals.
And seals are the dogs of the ocean.
Are they?
They are.
But if Bob went surfing, wouldn't someone else have seen him?
Not if he was drunk and it was at night.
Bob was a drinker.
He had two DUls on his record.
We soak him in alcohol, stuff him into a wetsuit and toss him into the ocean.
That could work.
But we should also consider we're just talking ourselves into something crazy.
We have to try.
I helped Trish because I wanted to do something good.
I have to see this through.
- I get that.
- Good.
Because this plan already has alcohol, surfing and sharks in it, okay?
It doesn't need doubt.
Hey.
You ready for your FBI interview?
Oh, is that today?
I'm kidding.
Of course I'm ready.
It's really easy.
Don't be nervous.
That's the most important thing.
- I'm not nervous.
- You sure?
Because you did slaughter that undead guy yesterday, and it just seems like that would rattle anyone.
Okay.
I just went over this with my parents.
I'm fine.
- I wanna focus on the interview.
- Good.
Because I heard from Leslie that Novak told the FBI you have violent tendencies.
Jenny said she told him you hit Christian with a tray.
And it's common knowledge that you quit Environmental Club because it wasn't radical enough.
Well, shit.
All that just made me really nervous.
No, didn't you hear what I said?
Don't be nervous.
It'll make you seem guilty.
Which you are.
Jesus, Eric.
I have to be in there in, like, five minutes.
Five minutes?
It's all the way across campus.
And is that what you're wearing?
Get the fuck away from me.
There she goes!
Breaking surfboards is super satisfying.
I get why sharks like it.
I also get why sharks like to eat people.
Huh!
I have a lot in common with sharks.
I guess.
How's it going with Bob?
Not great.
He's farting a lot.
I don't know if it was defrosting him or soaking him in alcohol - or if this is just the man he was.
- Well, technically it's not farting, it's his organs decomposing and releasing gas from all his orifices.
If it makes you feel any better.
It just makes me feel different.
Give me a hand.
-  - Oh, gosh.
Okay.
Thank you.
I know this isn't how you wanna be spending your day.
But you and I are the only ones who can help Trish.
Just so we're clear I'm not against helping people.
I like people.
Whose idea was it to buy that cow in that country for that guy?
You mean, that goat in Senegal for that school?
The point is, I like people.
And I know I worry.
I like to call it "proactive anticipation".
But I'm glad you wanna put good in the world, with Trish and the Meals on Wheels lady.
I'm proud of you.
Thank you.
Speaking of my Meals on Wheels lady You know, I told you, Jean - she's very sick.
- Yeah.
And her daughter is expecting a baby, and Jean isn't gonna live long enough to meet her.
Oh, that's sad.
And I have that special gift where I can make people live forever.
Okay.
I'm gonna proactively anticipate here.
You're not seriously thinking of turning Jean, are you?
I was considering it.
- Oh, my God!
- Well she's had such a tough life, and holding that baby just once would make her so happy.
Honey, that's crazy.
I've been running around all morning trying to stop Ron from turning people.
Now you wanna turn someone?
She only wants to live a couple of months, long enough to see the baby.
And then one of us can kill her.
One of us?
I've gotten close to her.
And what if she wants to start turning people, like Ron?
Even with the best intentions, a million things could go wrong.
All you did was return Trish's cat, and now we're driving a vodka-soaked corpse to the ocean to frame a fish for murder.
Please don't do this.
Okay.
It was just a thought.
Well I appreciate you running it by me first.
Uh-huh.
Now, let's get this tightly wrapped burrito of a man into the water.
Ugh.
Smells like vodka in here, Bob.
Yeah, it's not even three o'clock yet, Bob.
It's Gavin, from the skate park.
Cheeto, 'sup?
He's there?
Awesome.
An hour ago?
Why didn't you call me, bro?
Just don't let him leave.
I am being chill.
Fucking Cheeto.
Ron's at the skate park.
We gotta get over there.
What about our drunk in the trunk?
Skate park's on the way.
We'll stop there, then head to the beach.
We gotta wait till dark to dump Bob anyway.
Okay.
Skate park and then the beach.
On paper, this should be a fun day.
And, after we finished the pizza, Eric and I started watching Lord of the Rings and I immediately fell asleep.
- Immediately?
- Well, a few minutes in.
Had the Hobbits left The Shire yet?
No, they were still in the shower.
Shower.
Shire.
So you were with Eric the whole night?
- Yes.
- Right.
That's what he said.
Cool.
Well, I don't have any questions for you, so I am curious.
If you were asleep, how do you know Eric stayed in the room with you?
What?
You just said you were asleep for three hours.
So he could have gone anywhere, right?
I see the problem.
No, he couldn't have, because I'm a very light sleeper.
Yeah, I wake up all the time.
It's the opposite of narcolepsy.
I'm blanking on the name but it's a real condition, and I do have it.
Abby are you aware that lying to a federal agent is a criminal offense?
I'm not lying.
It's a real thing.
It's in the apnea family.
I saw it on a talk show, and I was, "That's me".
Are you lying to cover for Eric because he's the one who blew up the fracking site?
Eric?
No!
No, you searched his house.
You didn't find anything.
True.
We don't have the C4, but we know his stepfather had it, which means Eric had access to it.
Oh, my God, it's not Eric.
He fits the profile.
Child of divorce, high IQ, socially isolated once wrote an advanced chemistry paper on volatile combustibles and an op-ed on corporate overreach destroying owl habitats.
No.
You're twisting everything.
He's a sweet guy.
That op-ed was titled "Give A Hoot".
Eric had motive, means, and opportunity.
We're gonna get him, Abby.
The only question is if you are gonna get dragged down with him.
Hey, how'd it go?
Don't be nervous.
- You can't see a thing.
- No.
Makes you wonder how many of these other cars might have dead bodies in 'em.
Maybe that one.
Let's go try and find Ron.
Whoa.
Aah!
I feel nothing because I am undead!
Yes!
Oh, God.
Do you have the serum?
- I put it in your satchel.
- Great.
Because if he becomes feral and starts randomly eating skaters, people might pay more attention.
- So, what's the plan?
- We try to convince him to stop turning people, and if we can't, we kill him in that bathroom over there.
Ugh.
I hate going into public bathrooms.
Hammonds!
'Sup, guys?
Did you see me out there?
No more fear.
Ooh, everyone!
These are the people who helped me become undead!
Ron!
Joel!
Hi, Sheila.
Hi, Ron.
Why haven't you returned our calls?
I knew you'd be mad at me because I snuck into your basement and I made the head bite me.
And I didn't want to get yelled at because I am having so much fun.
being undead!
- Ron!
- Joel!
- Woohoo!
-  Ron!
We need to talk to you.
Being undead comes with a lot of responsibility.
Don't worry, Joel.
I'm only gonna kill bad people.
Great.
The other super important thing We don't want a bunch of undead running around so never ever turn anyone.
- Right, honey?
- Mm-hmm.
Yep, that's a great rule of thumb.
Generally.
- Always.
- Except in very rare situations.
Don't worry, I got it.
Never turn anyone.
- Right.
- Unless there are special circumstances like if they want to be turned.
No.
Don't turn anyone.
Period.
Period.
Period, ellipses, unless they ask you.
Perfect.
Thank you.
I'm not the one who confused him.
No, I'm not confused, Joel.
Being undead is amazing and I want to share it.
Selectively.
Right now, I've only turned one person.
And I only want to turn a few more for my paranormal subreddit group.
Thirteen, 18 people, tops.
You want to turn 18 people that you met on the internet?
I'd officially like to separate my thing from Ron's thing.
Ron, you may think you know what you're doing, but trust me.
No matter how much it feels like you have things under control, they can go off the rails very quickly.
So, please promise you won't turn anyone else.
Joel, I have never had real friends.
Even when I was a kid, I only had one friend.
Howie Mills.
He and I were the weirdos nobody wanted to hang out with.
But then, one summer, Howie's parents got him a swimming pool and suddenly everyone wanted to be Howie's friend.
Being able to turn people That's my swimming pool.
I'm sorry, Ron, but we can't let you do that.
And you have friends.
We're your friends.
Are you?
- Totally!
- Of course!
Oh, that's great.
Because I just made you the beneficiaries on my life insurance.
That way, if anything happens to me, you will get everything you deserve.
You don't happen to have the only copy of that with you, do you?
What are we gonna do?
We can't kill that little fucker now.
That life insurance policy is literally his life insurance policy.
Well, at least we gave him the serum, so he won't go feral.
Great.
He'll have all his faculties when he leads his undead army as it eats its way through America.
Maybe we should kidnap him.
He can't turn anyone if he's in our basement.
I don't want him in our basement.
I'm never gonna get a ping-pong table down there.
And by the way, I know Ron was pretty set on his plans, but you were no help.
Smells worse in here.
You think?
I was gonna say "better".
And I just don't think turning people is always so black and white.
Okay.
Is this only about Jean?
Or is this about you wanting to turn me?
- It's about Jean.
- Really?
Because it feels like something else is going on and I know you want an answer.
And I've been thinking about it, - but putting pressure on me - I turned Jean.
- What?
-  What was that?
I think Bob just exploded.
God dammit!
Where are you going?
I'm getting a Creamsicle from the ice cream truck.
And the next time we leave a vodka-soaked corpse in our car on a 100-degree day, we should crack a window.
Okay.
The only hard evidence they have on you is Dan's missing C4.
So what if we convince them that Dan buried it in the desert and then the fracking people built their trailer right on top of it?
And all that activity, boom!
Explosion.
That's not how C4 works.
Okay.
Okay.
What if we send a taunting letter to the FBI like it's from a radical environmental group taking credit?
Because guilty people sending cryptic letters to law enforcement never backfires?
Okay, fine!
Bad idea.
I I can't let this happen to you.
We don't really have a choice, Abby.
They think I'm guilty and I am.
It's only a matter of time before they arrest me.
No No.
This all happened because of me.
I'm gonna go to Agent Rogers and confess.
I'm gonna tell her I did it - and I did it alone.
- Abby No.
Either way, the C4 ties back to me.
I'm screwed no matter what you do and it's pointless for us to both go down.
Plus, if you confess, you'll put your whole family at risk.
No!
We can figure this out.
We can do this.
There's nothing left to do.
Oh, God!
You can't go to prison.
I might be going to prison.
Jean only wants to live a few months.
And she promised she would never leave her apartment.
I'll feed her and if she needs to go out, I'll take her.
Oh, so it's like we're adopting a shelter dog.
Exactly.
But instead of a scruffy little pup, she's a flesh-eating human who will live forever, unless I drive a spike through her brain, which, when the time comes, she may have an opinion about.
But like a shelter dog, when she looks up at you, eyes full of gratitude, you'll realize she rescued you.
Woof.
I love you.
Please don't make it hard for me to stay mad at you.
Rorry.
I was just so moved by her story.
And I had the power to help her.
And ever since Anne told me I was meant for something more, I've been searching for a greater purpose.
And I thought, this could be the reason this is all happening to me.
I understand.
But the way you did it Our lives are so chaotic.
The only thing that's been anchoring me is that we're a team.
I am so sorry.
I should have come to you first.
But we're still a team.
Okay.
So, how do we save Trish?
You're the best.
You think our shark plan could still work?
I don't know, honey.
Bob's just a gooey mess now.
And no one would ever find him.
Yeah, it'd be like pouring a tub of oatmeal into the ocean.
I fucked up.
I really fucked up.
Whoa.
What's wrong?
Everything.
Oh, honey.
What happened?
The FBI thinks Eric blew up the fracking site, and he's gonna go to jail, and it's my fault, and I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
It's okay.
We'll figure something out.
Absolutely.
The FBI are just fancy cops and we trick cops all the time.
What am I gonna do?
Eric's their only suspect.
Well, then We've got to come up with another suspect.
How?
No one's gonna lie for us and say they blew up a fracking site.
They might if they've already been blown up.
- Bob.
- Bob.
Bob?
Is this the same C4 we used?
Yep.
It'll have the same chemical footprint.
I dug it out of the trash after my mom threw it away.
You really need to talk to her about proper disposal of hazardous waste.
She tries.
She just gets so busy.
- Did you find another fracking site?
- There's one in Palmdale, I'd like to not be there anymore.
Not that that's what this is about.
Perfect.
We'll head there after midnight and detonate Bob.
This is my fault.
I feel like I should do it.
Uh-uh, young lady.
You're still grounded from your first bombing.
Now, when you get to the fracking site, you wanna tuck the whole thing under the tarp, just to make sure the C4 residue gets mixed with Bob's genetic material.
Then they'll blame Bob for both explosions and you'll be off the hook.
I love you.
It.
Love it.
This idea.
Love it.
It was all her.
Well, and also, they'll have to release Trish because Bob killed himself.
Everybody wins.
Except Bob.
Who just keeps losing.
I know this is going to sound sarcastic, but this is a great plan and I'm really impressed with you guys.
Don't listen to her, honey.
It is a great plan.
Okay.
We're all set.
Now, are you guys clear on how to use this?
We plant the body, and don't press this button until we're 50 feet away.
- Fifty yards.
- Right.
Fifty yards away.
- It's 500 feet.
- Oh, boy.
We got it.
Look at us.
Team Hammond!
Anne was right.
There's nothing I can't do.
You went from "we" to "I" pretty fast there, honey.
Rorry.
Would you rather have a neck like a turtle or a neck like a giraffe?
I don't feel like playing.
Are you in a bad mood because Mr. Poplovic put a bag over your head until you cried?
Yes.
Anyone would have cried, Janko.
Thank you, Radul.
Giraffe neck.
- Me too.
-  'Sup?
We need to speak with Christa Caldwell.
- She's not here.
- Are you her son?
- Yes.
- Does she love you?
Yes.
Do you have the bag?
Yes.
This is bullshit.
You are lucky.
The plastic bag is, like, ten times worse.
What is your passcode?
Fuck you.
Okay!
Six, nine, six, nine.
Nice.
Here we go.
Mom.
Hello.
Christa Caldwell?
We have your son.
You're supposed to talk now.
How would I know that?
I have a bag over my head, fucko.
If you want to see your son again, we need to find Roy Eastman Kodak.
He's a handsome man.
He left your house.
He had blood on his shirt.
Really?
Oh Thank you.
The real name of the man we are looking for is Joel Hammond.
Joel Hammond.
With two "M" s or one?
Hello.
It's me again.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1 -  You sure that's the right key?
-  I got it, I got it.
I really hope this works and I don't get arrested.
I have my interview with the MI admissions woman tomorrow, and I really don't want her to be my one phone call.
This will work.
And you're gonna crush that MIT interview.
If you don't wear the bow tie.
I'm absolutely wearing the bow tie.
It's collegiate.
Dress for the job you want.
Thought I put a detonator in here.
I think the bow tie is just something you can control.
These are stressful times.
We're planting evidence to frame Bob.
My parents are detonating his remains at a fracking site.
And so your mind takes the figurative noose around your neck and turns it into a silk ribbon that can be loosened with a single tug.
Mine's a clip-on.
Speaking of stressful times, how are you feeling about that guy you killed?
I mean, I know you said it was fine because he was undead, but still.
He was a guy.
That you killed with a knife into his brain.
Actually, it hasn't been great.
I didn't sleep well last night.
I kept having this dream.
Replaying what happened in my head over and over.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I'm in the car racing over to Morgan's place.
And I burst through the door just as he is attacking my parents.
So I reach for my knife, to try and kill him and I can't find it.
And then suddenly I'm underwater and I wake up, struggling to breathe.
That must be terrifying.
I once had a dream that Neil deGrasse Tyson called me an asshole and I had to sleep with the light on for a week.
Abby, if you ever have another nightmare like that, you can always call me, you know.
Yeah.
Thanks.
It's my mom.
She says they're headed home.
How'd it go?
She said medium.
Medium?
Mom?
Dad?
Where are you guys?
We're in the kitchen!
So the C4 worked?
Oh, yeah.
And everybody's Oh, fuck me!
Oh, so Thriller!
What happened to your arm?
You're probably wondering what happened to your mother's arm.
- What's with Dad?
- I'll say!
Look at it.
It was a big explosion.
His ears are still ringing.
But you were 500 feet away when you hit the detonator, right?
We were juggling a lot of details, you know?
Wires, distances.
Some of Bob leaked out onto your dad's favorite Pumas  which I told him he shouldn't have worn, but he says they're lucky.
I'm not sure I'm catching everything.
Maybe Abby can help you put my arm back in the socket.
It's a two-man operation.
You wanna line it up or shove it in?
I'll do whatever you think I'm saying right now.
Shove it is.
Wait.
This is what woozy boys do.
-  - I'll line it up.
Push until you hear a pop.
On three.
One two  Three!
-  -  Ah Ah Ah Good as new!
Thanks, guys.
Okay!
That was gross as fuck.
Well, it's 3:00 a.m. and I just reattached a part of my mother.
So I'm gonna call it a night.
Thanks for your help earlier.
Of course, my phone's always on.
Yeah, good night, collaborators.
Um Remember when you told me Joel told me to try to keep an eye out for Abby, and something came up.
What is it?
Don't tell her I told you this but I think she's been having trouble dealing with killing that guy.
She's been having nightmares.
Oh, no.
Poor Abby.
Thanks for letting us know, and don't worry.
We won't tell her.
What was that about?
I'll tell you later.
What do you think I just said?
The potato?
We've exposed her to so much violence.
Of course she has problems.
I know.
I feel terrible.
Oh, I was talking to myself.
I didn't know you could hear me.
Hi.
Hello.
Warm shower really helped.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.
She keeps saying she's fine.
I wish she could go to therapy, but there's so much she can't talk about.
It isn't fair.
Where do murderers go for help?
I think a lot of them don't get the help they need.
I know we try to keep her out of what we do but she's so strong-willed.
We have to get at better protecting her.
Set firmer boundaries.
Yeah, like tomorrow.
Are we still kidnapping Ron?
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna be so tired.
I hope we don't have to chase him.
We can't let Abby know what we're doing or she'll wanna come with us.
Absolutely.
Although, if we did have to chase Ron, it'd be nice to have a third person.
And she's so fast.
She'd have him face down and hog tied in 15 seconds.
We wouldn't even have to get out of the car.
- No.
- No.
We're not bringing her.
How are we capturing Ron anyway?
After the skatepark, he's not going to trust us.
Maybe somehow we could lure him to the house?
Yeah.
The serum.
What?
We can tell him if he's gonna turn people, at least let us give him a vial of serum so his friends don't go feral.
That's a great idea.
We tie him up, drag him down to the basement, and keep him there until he understands he can't just go around biting people.
Sounds like a lot of work.
Maybe we just shoot him in the mouth?
Ugh Yeah.
I didn't love it.
Yes, it's a good day For singin' a song And it's a good day for movin' along Yes, it's a good day How can anything go wrong?
It's a good day From morning till night Yes, it's a good day For curing your ills Hey, buddy.
Mama brought you breakfast.
Thin sliced.
Just how you like it.
You know you gotta get goin' If you're gonna make a showin' And you've got the right of way Can you say "Mama"?
Mama.
Oh, man.
That's not our vegetable peeler, is it?
Of course not.
This is from my special drawer.
Wait, which one is your special drawer?
Well, that's on you.
I'm gonna run over to Jean's and give her Bob's ears.
If you hear from Ron, let me know and I'll come home right away.
Jean knows she can't leave the house, right?
- That was part of your deal?
- Yeah.
She stays inside, eats what I bring her, won't kill anyone.
She promised.
So?
I promised not to use your hairbrush anymore.
And then I never started using it again, but she might not be as honest as me.
You know that Knights of Serbia group that hunts people like Mom and you didn't join for some fucking reason?
Yes.
To protect you.
Also, language.
All right.
Well, they couldn't find someone for this area.
So now the head of the whole effing organization is flying out here to handle it her effing self.
So we're all effed in the A. That was worse.
That's like watching Scarface on TBS.
How do you know all this?
'Cause Tommy texted you and you left your phone at the top of the stairs?
Shit!
The Grand Knight Prior.
Tommy told me she became their leader because she tracked and killed the last known undead person in North America.
That's not good.
Although, it is nice to see a woman make it to the top of a male-dominated field.
I agree.
So, then, Dad should be a Knight of Serbia, I'll be his heir and one day, I'll be the woman running that shit.
You're not gonna be my heir.
That's right.
In fact we're setting boundaries.
Starting now.
It's from Ron.
He says he'll be by at two to get the serum.
Give me that.
How're you gonna stop him from turning people?
Do you have a plan?
We're not discussing it.
This is a boundary moment.
'Cause I have some ideas.
- No.
- What are they?
No.
Go to school.
Seamless.
She does not let up.
I know, but no matter how hard it is, we have to hold the line.
We can be firm.
Remember that time she wanted a guinea pig and we said no and then we got it for her?
Let's just do the first half of that.
Okay.
I'm gonna go see Jean.
I'll get things ready here.
I was thinking Ron might object to elements of the kidnapping process.
So I should wear some kind of padding he can't bite through.
Like towels.
Great.
Just don't use the good towels.
Of course.
I'll use the blue ones?
- No.
- The green ones?
- No.
- The beach towels?
We just got those.
You know what?
I'll just use rags.
Fine, just don't use the good rags.
Wow.
Hey Eric.
Are you going to that MIT thing today?
My interview?
Yeah, why?
Can I get a ride?
To my interview?
Yeah, why?
Because I also have an interview.
You know, just because I have a shitty attitude doesn't mean I can't create an algorithm for coordinating recycling pickups among the limited neighborhood user base.
No, but statistically, it does make it less likely.
Wait So how come I've never seen you in any of my math classes?
I take them at the college.
Huh And there you have it.
Hey.
Is Winter younger than me?
I think so.
Why?
No goddamn reason.
How are you?
Did you sleep okay last night?
You're very sweet.
We're not checking in with Abby every time we see her.
Got it.
I'm not your dad.
Although, I am dad material.
You don't need to keep telling me that.
Also, let's not talk about parents.
I'm kind of annoyed with mine right now.
Okay, enough said.
No more parent talk.
It's just they're planning something weird with Ron and they won't let me help, which is a mistake, because they literally blew themselves up last night.
Huh We could cut out early and see what they're up to?
That is, unless our plan didn't work and Agent Rogers shows up to arrest me.
Oh, God.
I summoned her.
Eric.
Abby.
Agent Rogers.
I was just telling Principal Novak that there's been a development in our investigation.
Which means That even though you gave one of the most dreadful, self-incriminating interviews I've ever been a part of you're no longer a suspect.
So you found out who actually blew up the fracking site?
We have a suspect, but we're still trying to put all the pieces together.
Right now, the guy's a little scatterbrained.
I know that doesn't make sense to you, but it cracked a lot of people up this morning.
Anyway, your government thanks you for your cooperation.
Here.
Have some Skittles.
- Oh, my God!
We did it, it worked!
- I'm not going to jail!
I'm a free man!
My future's unwritten!
I'm gonna eat all these at once.
I've never done that before.
That was a mistake.
But I have the freedom to make mistakes.
Listen.
I'll deal with my parents today.
You've been around enough of our craziness lately.
Just take a day off.
Call your mom, tell her you're off the hook and go get yourself into MIT.
That's probably for the best.
I need some time to rethink my interview outfit anyways.
You tried on the bow tie, huh?
I look like a child weatherman.
All right, Jean.
Here's your pain medication.
Oh, yippee.
Can I have it with a bourbon back?
I have to say, you are looking great today.
I love what you're doing with your hair.
Aw, thanks.
I'm trying this new thing where I wash it.
Hi, Jean.
I brought your lunch.
Oh, hello.
Hi.
I'm Amanda, I'm Jean's caregiver.
What'd you bring our girl today?
Oh, sorry.
I can only open it for clients.
It's a Meals on Wheels policy.
I'm also not allowed to date Jean.
I get it.
I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, even though they add a lot of fun to everyone's day.
Well I will see you next week, Jean.
Yeah, if I'm still alive.
You!
Oh, my God!
I feel incredible!
Whoa.
Jesus Christ!
I know, isn't it great?
Oh, look at me.
I haven't moved like this in years.
Oh, Sheila, thank you.
Thank you for this gift.
And where's my Abby today?
Oh, my husband and I are trying to keep her out of our undead antics.
Which isn't easy, because she's disturbingly good at planning, committing and covering up crimes.
I'm gonna knit her a hat.
Are you ready for the first meal of your new life?
Please.
It's ears.
Crunchy and salty.
The onion rings of the human body.
Mmm Right?
Whoa.
I'm tasting it, and not just in my mouth.
That's the tingle, my friend.
Wow.
Well, I have a very busy day, so unless there's anything else you need.
Oh, no, no.
I'm good, you go ahead.
I've got lots to do.
I'm going to organize my kitchen, do a little yoga.
And later I'm gonna invite my landlord over for tea, so I can kill him.
What?
No!
Jean, we had an agreement.
I bring you food, you don't attack anyone, and you don't put up a fuss when we kill you in three months.
He's trying to evict me by saying I'm not paying my rent and he's cashing my checks every month.
I'm not going to put up with his bullshit any longer!
And besides, he's got ears like LBJ.
Jean, no.
You promised you wouldn't kill anyone.
You're gonna have to work this out calmly and civilly.
That's how you got these?
Calmly and civilly?
Hey.
I made you.
That'll work.
Shit!
Joel was that you briefly blocking the light of the peephole and then saying "shit"?
Ron!
You're early!
Three hours.
It's inexcusable.
But I wanted to catch you off guard, in case this was a trap.
Oh, I'm kidding.
Yeah, no.
My friend Andre wants me to turn him today so I thought I'd stop by early and pick up the serum.
If this is a bad time, I could turn him first and come back.
No, no.
Please, sit.
Okay.
I'll get the serum.
Make yourself comfortable.
Put your feet up, let your guard down.
I'll just be a minute.
Okay.
Hm Hey, Joel?
Question.
Is there a Fanning sister named Ishmael?
It fits, but it sounds odd.
What are you doing?
Getting a turkey out of the oven.
Goddammit!
What are they doing?
It looks like they are capturing a man who does not wish to be captured.
If Joel Hammond is searching for the undead, perhaps that man is undead.
We should tell Mr. Poplovic.
No, no, no.
First, we must be certain he is undead.
Mr. Poplovic does not tolerate mistakes.
Remember the sandwich incident?
I was so certain he wanted mayonnaise and not mustard.
The man is not forgiving.
How long do you plan on keeping me in this wretched underground dungeon?
- Forever!
- Gary.
He forced me to bite him, Joel.
It was humiliating.
Come on.
Try it again, big man.
I can still spit.
Get over here!
I will fucking drench you!
If I'm going to be your prisoner, I'd like to request a different dungeon.
You're not a prisoner, and this isn't a dungeon.
We are hosting you in our downstairs guest suite, until we can convince you that turning people is bad.
Forever!
Gary!
You break the rules, you suffer the consequences, dude.
Plus, my mom was chained up down here and she never complained.
Looks like she tried to chew her way through the post.
That doesn't feel like a five-star review.
Maybe she likes the taste of wood, shithead.
- Oh!
- Abby.
What?
That's what guards call prisoners.
He's not a prisoner.
- Forever!
- All right!
Gary, you're going in the linen closet.
And you, upstairs and do your homework.
Seriously?
Another boundary moment?
You never would have caught him without me.
Actually, I taught you how to tackle.
So, in a way, you never would have caught him without me.
Wow, fragile masculinity much?
Upstairs.
And take Gary with you.
Fine.
Keep pushing me away.
But what you guys do affects me and I've earned the right to be part of it.
Can we watch Moulin Rouge on the big TV?
We've seen it, like, eight times.
- It's good.
- Nothing is that good.
I like to dance to "La Marmalade".
Your potty mouth daughter has a point, Joel.
Please, let's not.
Let me tell you a story.
When I was a kid, my parents also tried to keep me out of the family business.
They owned a candy store.
- This is not gonna line up at all.
- Every day I wanted to go there and help them, but they would say, "No, Ron.
Mr. Ruffins Chocolate Factory and Amusement Emporium is no place for a child".
- I was right.
- The point is the reason they excluded me from their world, that I might taste a piece of candy.
That was arbitrary to me as your exclusion does to Abby.
We're keeping her away from murder and mayhem.
Your parents should have been investigated by the state.
No offense.
I'm sure they were lovely.
All I know is excluding a child from what you do as a family can affect them for the rest of their life.
I'm not saying all my problems were caused by bad parenting but five therapists have said exactly that.
God, it is such a beautiful day.
You know what I feel like doing?
Sticking my head out the window and biting the wind.
I mean, it seems crazy, but a million dogs can't be wrong.
Right?
Somebody's in a good mood.
You know, I've been going through some stuff but I got great news today and now it's nothing but blue skies with a side of fries.
Oh, watch out.
That's right.
'Cause here I come.
No, watch out.
It's a red light.
-  -  Sorry!
You okay?
Yeah.
Something rolled out from under the seat.
It's a detonator.
What?
No.
That's part of the seat, so you can just put it back.
Eric, I'm applying to MIT.
I know what a detonator looks like.
Well why'd you bring a detonator with you?
Now shit makes sense.
Abby throwing your backpack away, then trying to make me think that was a part of some fucked-up game.
And this?
You and Abby blew up the fracking site.
Nuh-uh.
Jean come and sit down.
No.
Come on, help me go through your bank records.
If you really wanna nail your landlord for ripping you off, this is the way to do it.
Look at him down there, watering plants like he's not a thief!
I get it.
When I turned, I wanted to kill the first person I saw.
And I did, actually so that's not a great story.
I'm sorry.
You know, people my age usually have kids who look after them, but, oh, no my daughter had to move to London so she could send me shitty English biscuits once a year on my birthday.
Okay.
Bank records.
First thing I noticed is you buy a fuck ton of slippers.
I give them as gifts.
Okay, no, I don't.
I have a problem.
And also there's a lot of checks here made out to cash.
Cash?
Why would she do that?
- Who?
- Amanda.
She helps me fill out my checks.
I've been too sick to do it myself.
Jean I don't think it's your landlord who's scamming you.
Oh!
You're still here!
I forgot my sweater.
Or did you just come over for me to sign more checks, Amanda?
Or should I call you "cash"?
What?
Oh, Jean.
She gets a little bit confused after she's had her pills.
Don't move.
I wanna get a good look at those onion rings on the side of your head.
Jean We're being civil, remember?
Thief!
I gave you slippers!
No, you didn't.
No, I didn't.
Amanda we know you took Jean's money.
We have the bank records to prove it.
So you just need to reimburse her.
Actually I don't need to do anything.
Amanda, come on.
We know you made a mistake.
And mistakes are just opportunities to learn how to do the right thing.
Thank you, Mary Poppins.
But you can save your bullshit.
And there is nothing you can do.
I always make the checks out to cash.
I use a fake ID.
There's no paper trail.
I'm really starting to not like you.
Oh, no!
Does that mean you're not gonna sign my yearbook?
Oh, good, Amanda.
Just keep talking like that.
These people don't do anything with their money.
And nobody cares about them enough to even notice.
Look at Jean.
I mean, her daughter hates her so much, she moved all the way to London just to get away from her.
- Oh!
- That's a terrible thing to say!
Uh-oh.
I've upset the volunteer and the half-dead lady.
Actually Jean's completely dead, and so am I. What?
I couldn't.
You know we don't gain weight.
Give me that.
You know, Jean Don't listen to Amanda when she says those things about your daughter.
You could taste in her gallbladder how bitter she was.
She wasn't wrong.
I did drive my daughter away.
- Jean, why would you say that?
- 'Cause it's true.
When she was young, she loved to paint.
She wanted to be an artist.
She was so smart.
I wanted her to be a lawyer.
So she did the smart thing.
She became an artist.
Very far away from me.
But things are okay now.
And when she has the baby, she's coming to visit.
They're better.
But I'll never get those years back.
A little advice about Abby?
Yeah?
If I were you I'd listen to her, when she tells you who she is.
Thanks, Jean.
You know, this?
What's happening here?
This should be an ad for Meals on Wheels.
I got your text.
You got Ron down in the basement without me?
Yeah.
He showed up early.
And it got a little crazy.
He ran down the street, and Don't be mad Abby took him down.
And then, I tripped on a sprinkler head and fell on top of him.
A contribution which should not be underestimated.
- So Abby is - She's fine.
And I made it very clear that in spite of her being skilled, intelligent and fearless her help is not welcome.
How was your day?
Jean and I solved the mystery of who's been stealing her money and Don't be mad.
We killed that person.
- You and Jean killed?
- I didn't get mad about your thing.
Ugh.
Should have let you go first.
Jean made an interesting point about Abby.
Maybe she's going to be who she's going to be, and we should stop fighting her about it.
Yeah.
Abby made a similar point about Abby.
Maybe we need to rethink this.
Rethink what?
Can I guess?
If I guess everything, am I close?
Actually, we're talking about including you more.
So I get to be a Knight of Serbia?
Hang on.
We know this is what you want, and that you're good at it.
But we also know that it's taking a toll on you.
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine.
We know about the nightmares.
What?
One of my powers is that if I touch your forehead while you're sleeping, I can see your dreams.
Fucking Eric told you.
Yes.
But he's worried about you, like we are.
I know you don't wanna talk about it, but killing that undead guy was a traumatic experience.
That's why you're having those nightmares.
No, it's not a nightmare about killing someone.
It's about feeling helpless.
In the dream, I am trying to save you guys, and I don't make it in time.
And that's what wakes me up at night.
I know you wanna protect me by keeping me in the dark, but it just makes me more afraid.
By the way, the fracking explosion worked.
Everyone's off the hook.
What?
Really?
We did it!
- Eric's not going to jail?
- Yeah.
That means Trish isn't, either.
Thank God.
I know.
It's great.
And you know why it worked?
Because we did it together.
Love you, guys.
- Wow.
- I know.
I think she just told us who she is.
- You sure you want this?
- Fuck, yeah!
Agreeing to be a Knight of Serbia is a big responsibility.
It has to be a calm and measured decision.
- Fuck, yeah.
- We're a team now.
We have to check in with each other.
No going off and doing things that might endanger all of us.
I won't.
I promise.
And, this means you have to clean your room more often.
You're overreaching.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Do the honors.
All right.
Close it up.
And send it off.
I wonder how long it'll take to hear back.
It's an ancient organization, honey.
Who knows how quickly they'll  "Application received.
The Grand Knight Prior will contact you shortly for a home visit".
A home visit?
They're coming here?
We have a head in the linen closet and a chained-up guest in our basement.
I gotta scrub the freezer and clean out all the Bobsicles.
Someone needs to clean my room.
It's disgusting.
I'm kidding, I'll do it.
Listen, this is important.
If the Grand Knight Prior is coming here, we have to make sure there is nothing in this house that gives us away.
I try my best to forget All the pictures in my head Of your smile And the way That your heart drew my attention to Oh, I'm not crazy I'm just crazy about you Trying to be strong But it's hard not to get My heart involved I play it all But my eyes tell it all You're all I want Oh, I'm not crazy I'm just crazy about you Oh, I'm not crazy I'm just crazy about you.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Good morning, Ron.
How was your breakfast?
Delicious.
Since I turned, I normally just eat scrambled legs.
Because, get it?
You gave him a knife?
And a fork.
It's how Ron prefers to eat.
Sheila is messy and sexy, and I'm neat and petite.
We're all God's children, Joel.
Absolutely.
So, listen, we need to gag you and tie your hands behind your back.
What?
I have an interview this morning with the Grand Prior of the Knights of Serbia, and she can't know there's an undead person in our basement.
Or she might slaughter us with her broadsword.
And while I always saw myself dying at home, it was peacefully in bed, not slipping on my own guts trying to get to the phone.
But, good news.
We'll be gagging you with this napkin, which is made out of 100% pure Irish linen.
Ooh, soft.
- Uh - Lucky!
Hey, here's an idea.
What if you unchain me and I get out of your hair for a few hours?
You're stressed, I'm stressed.
I think a break would do us all some good.
You wanna go meet your Reddit friend Andre who you were planning on turning yesterday, right?
No.
Because even though I promised to bite him, you have made me realize how bad that is.
And so, I will break my promise.
Now, let me go and I promise I'll come back this afternoon.
Sorry.
We can't let you leave until we're convinced you're not gonna go run around biting every weirdo you meet on the internet.
It's reckless, and it makes all of us undead look bad.
- Put your wrists together.
-  Don't you think it's odd that you're trying to join an organization dedicated to killing the undead, even though you're married to one?
If I don't become a Knight, someone else will be hunting Sheila.
This way, she'll be safe.
Still seems problematic.
If you want my opinion Sorry.
We're kind of in a rush.
-  -  Hey.
Weren't these napkins a wedding gift from your grandmother?
I think so.
Why?
I just realized this is the first time we've used them.
Aw    So what's our strategy for this meeting?
Well, we welcome her in, make a good impression.
And then those of us who go to school will go to school.
Seriously?
You said I was part of the team now.
You are part of the team, honey, but you still have to graduate.
Knights with high school diplomas make a lot more than Knights without high school diplomas.
-  She's here.
- Now, remember.
She rose to the top of an ancient organization that prides itself in killing people like your mother.
This woman is dangerous.
Equally important.
Don't treat Abby like a child, and embarrass her in front of this badass who could be her mentor in badassery.
You're already a badass.
But, I'm sorry, I have to get this out of my system.
Oh, you're so cute and I'm just so proud of you!
All right, everybody.
Let's go.
Hello.
Hi.
Can I help you?
I'm Petra Blazek, Grand Prior of the Knights of Serbia.
We have an appointment.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm Joel Hammond.
With the sun behind you, I  Hey, come on in.
Don't worry.
This happens all the time.
People hear "Grand Knight Prior" and they expect a six-foot warrior princess riding a horse and swinging a burning skull.
But me?
I like comfortable shoes and a four-door sedan.
Well, I'm Sheila.
This is our daughter Abby.
- Hello.
- Come, sit.
Abby, the heir-apparent.
Have you ever had a real Milwaukee peanut butter fudge bar?
No.
I have not.
Well, if Mom and Dad say it's okay, then we're going to change that.
Is it just for kids or  I swear I always say I'm gonna get organized, but I never do.
Yeah.
Here it is.
What is that?
Oh, the corker?
Love this thing.
It dates back to 17th century Dubrovnik.
First, you restrain your zombie.
Then, you clamp its head tight between these doohickeys.
Then Hello!
You pull its brains right out.
It's very effective.
I like this one.
Feels good in my hand.
That's one of my favorites.
You know how they say, "In one ear and out the other"?
This turns that from an expression into instructions.
All right, Abby.
Time for school.
Mom, I don't wanna go to school.
I wanna stay here and try the corker on a cantaloupe.
I could run out and get us one, but you, young lady, need to be on your way.
Fine.
It was nice to meet you, Miss Blazek.
My father would make an excellent Knight of Serbia.
And when the time comes, I too will prove myself worthy.
But I must now go to school.
I will return at four with a cantaloupe.
Should you and the corker still be here that would be sick.
I like her.
She shows the fire of a young woman who could, one day, make a very fine Guardian of the Living World.
But let's talk about you, Joel.
I was going to take over this position myself, but your video was impressive.
- Thank you.
- My concern is the last two Knights in this region have abandoned their post.
I just wanna make sure you have what it takes to fight a soulless, bloodthirsty zombie.
That's funny.
That's the second time you've used that word, "zombie".
Which isn't a problem.
Sheila just loves counting words.
No, it just perpetuates stereotypes.
That the undead are nothing more than B-movie killing machines.
Some of them might be very nice.
Nice?
I don't understand.
She means like serial killers can be nice.
Then you let your guard down and pow!
They serial-kill you.
Good point, honey.
So How do we make me a Knight of Serbia, Petra?
As I was saying, my concern is Killing isn't easy.
Means getting your hands dirty.
Our last Knight, Tommy, was a marine sniper.
You're a realtor.
A realtor who thinks zombies are a blight on this world and wants to take that corker and decant their brains.
Really?
You feeling big?
You seem to have a problem with this, Sheila.
I'm just not into unnecessary violence.
Against anybody, living or otherwise.
Well, we need our Knights to have a supportive family, especially right now.
We believe we have an outbreak in Santa Clarita.
There are too many signs.
- Oh, shit!
- I know.
Right in your own town.
We just need to find hard proof, concrete evidence and when we do the Knights will take action.
You and me see eye-to-eye, Petra.
I wanna show you something in the other room.
Believe me.
I think you'll find it worth your while.
Are you intrigued?
You should be.
It's right this way.
Am I looking into the ocean or are your eyes really that blue?
Ooh!
Woman overboard.
Mr. Ball Legs!
Everything okay in there?
I got you, you naughty little fucker.
We're good!
Something bad happened.
I love that I never get a moment's peace.
Seriously, I'm not being sarcastic.
I get bored easily.
What's up?
Remember when we were at that Bob guy's house planting evidence, and I couldn't find the detonator?
It was in my car.
OK.
Not a big deal.
After school, we'll get rid of it.
No, Winter found it.
She put everything together.
She knows we blew up the fracking site.
Abby, what if she tells someone?
I mean, we barely know this woman.
Shit!
What did she say?
I don't remember, I panicked.
I started rambling about owls, geodes and how the International Astronomical Union keeps jerking Pluto around.
Jesus, you should have just crashed the car.
I know.
And I was so freaked out, I tanked my MIT interview.
I smiled like an idiot, and answered every question with, "Absotively, positutely".
It was charming, maybe the first time?
- No, it was never charming.
- Okay.
I'll talk to Winter.
You straighten out the MIT thing.
No, I should talk to Winter with you.
I was there.
You going alone to explain it away makes us look even more guilty.
No.
You need to get your life back on track, and I am not letting this stuff fuck it up.
This is about your future, Eric.
Wow.
When did you get so maternal?
It's from taking care of my parents.
I call them "the twins," and they're taking years off my life.
It's a hammer and a knife.
I wanted you to see it 'cause I thought you'd appreciate it.
It came to me in a dream.
I'm a bit of a dreamer.
I'm impressed.
You took two things from different worlds and saw how well they fit together.
Speaking of things that go well together, what about me and the Knights of Serbia?
Sorry!
It was a spider.
I dealt with it, and now it's sleeping.
What did I miss?
Well, I was just about to tell Joel that before I can make a decision on his Knighthood, I need to send him on a mission to prove his worthiness.
A mission?
Two weeks ago, we got reports of someone in the area looking for Serbian bile.
Then a week later, we heard about infected clams.
Now, a man who goes by the name of Ron Ruffin I'm sorry, I'm throwing a lot at you.
Should I slow down?
No, no, we're following you.
This Ron Ruffin is claiming on Reddit to be a zombie and offering to turn people.
Based on details in his post, he could be the real deal.
We need to find him before he causes trouble.
Huh.
What a mystery.
He could be anywhere.
I'm going to stake out Ron's apartment.
He's been communicating with a Reddit user named Andre.
I need you to find out if Ron has turned him, and if he has kill Andre and bring me his head.
Or his spine.
Or an arm.
You know, whatever's easy.
I'm gonna handle this so fast, you'll think I started it last week.
Love that energy.
Well, I'm off.
But first, I'll get you Andre's file.
And maybe help myself to a slice of that beautiful coffee cake no one's offered me.
There's cake, plates, and a serving knife.
Do the math, bitch.
I know you don't like this, but the new Knight is either gonna be me or Petra.
And if you don't like how she asked for cake, imagine her coming after you with the corker.
Let her try.
Unlike a cantaloupe, I'll eat her face.
We just have to put up with her until I complete my mission.
Which is already done, because Ron didn't bite that guy, because Ron is in our basement, because we are geniuses.
Oh, shit!
Boy!
Ron must have really wanted out of here, because this post is not a fun eat.
There's no way fixing this is gonna be under $1,000.
No!
You can't get a contractor to come over and take a shit in your house for under $1,000.
He's probably on his way to turn Andre.
God damn him!
This behavior is exactly why the Knights think the undead are so irresponsible.
We have to get to Andre before Ron does.
Now I really do have a mission.
Wait Are we just gonna leave it like that?
- What do you propose?
- I don't know.
We can lift up the mattress and wedge it in Oh, fuck it.
Let's just go.
- Winter!
- Abigail.
So, Eric mentioned that you found something in his car - and got confused and maybe thought - Abby.
I know it was a detonator.
Please don't lie to me.
It's not gonna make me think it's something else.
It's just gonna make me think, "Oh, this girl, who could have been my friend, lies to me".
Well, this no longer feels like a hallway conversation.
Eric and I blew up the fracking site.
And I know that was over-the-top, but these people were just gonna fuck up the environment, make their money and move on.
We had to do something to stop them.
I mean, really do something.
Abby, I'm not going to tell anyone.
I meant what I said to that FBI agent.
What you guys did was awesome.
You fucking went for it.
Hey, what are you doing later?
I had a thing with a cantaloupe, but what's up?
There's a bar where I sometimes do open mics.
The last time I was there, my guitar got stolen.
I'm pretty sure it was this sleazebag manager.
- That's terrible.
- Right?
My dad gave it to me, so I really wanna get it back.
I'm going there tonight.
I could use some backup, if you and Eric are free.
Sure, I'll go with you.
What about Eric?
Yeah, I really wanna keep him away from stuff like this.
I don't wanna screw up his life more than I already have.
Okay, so you and me, then.
Seven o'clock?
Cool.
I lost my fake ID at a rave.
So that was pretty wild, and my fake ID guy is out of town.
You have never been to a bar and you don't have a fake ID.
Is that what you're trying to say?
Oh, no.
That's what I was trying not to say.
Hey.
I just spoke to Winter, everything's fine.
Oh, thank God.
And I reached the MIT woman.
She said I could have a do-over interview next month.
That's awesome.
Wanna grab some pizza tonight and jinx our victories by daring to celebrate them?
Oh, I can't.
I made plans with Winter.
Cool, cool.
Would your evening be enhanced, I wonder, by the presence of a male escort?
Sorry, I mean a boyfriend.
Okay.
A guy friend.
Damn you, English language, you un-precise mongrel!
Actually, she asked me to help with this thing, and it's probably best if she and I do it alone.
That's fine.
No problem.
- You should've just said you had plans.
- I did.
Then no one's feelings should be hurt.
We could get breakfast tomorrow.
Kind of feels like a pity meal but, - if you're buying - I'm not.
I'll still come.
God, I hope Ron didn't beat us here.
I know.
I don't wanna have another zom Somebody to deal with, who happens to be undead.
For a second, I thought you were gonna say "zombie," but you didn't.
You said "zombody," which is different.
You've accidentally said hurtful things to me.
But I can't think of any right now, because I don't use them against you.
- Hello Andre?
- Hi!
Indeed.
I am Dr. Troy Vernon, and this is Dr. Helen St. Troy.
We're Ron Ruffin's psychiatrists.
Has Ron been by today?
Ron?
I don't believe so.
May the other Troy and I come in?
We need to talk to you about something very important.
I guess.
I mean, I don't have a choice, right?
You guys are doctors.
That is correct.
It has come to our attention that Ron is claiming he can bite people, and make them undead.
Unfortunately, Ron is off his medication and experiencing delusions.
And while there's no such thing as undead, a human bite should be avoided, as it can lead to many real diseases.
Tetanus, hepatitis, droop-eye, more.
Okay.
Thank you for warning me.
Now, if you don't mind, I'm actually not feeling very well.
- Really.
What's the matter?
- My stomach's just feeling off.
I'm sorry, you need to go.
Shit!
We're too late.
How is this happening?
Is this bar somehow in Europe?
I've been performing here for a while.
So they let it slide.
That is so cool.
This is so cool.
You've never had whiskey before, have you?
Tastes like cough syrup that's been sitting in a lawnmower.
Yeah.
I'd rather have a Shirley Temple with extra cherries.
Then I think of all the other underage kids who can't get into bars, and I don't wanna let them down.
There he is.
All right.
We're just going to walk over there and tell him you need your guitar back.
Don't be nervous.
I'm not nervous.
Oh, sorry.
I'm used to doing this stuff with someone who needs to take a deep breath before stepping on an escalator.
Let's do it.
All right.
Hey, Dustin, cool hemp necklace.
Where the hell is my guitar?
Not this again.
I don't have your stupid guitar.
You and I were the only people in the green room after my set Friday.
I left for five minutes.
And when I came back you and guitar were gone.
Dude, it was a gift from her dad.
Don't be an asshole.
Rise above your man bun.
Who the fuck are you?
Abby Hammond.
I retrieve guitars.
Maybe you confused it with your shitty guitar.
I'll just go check your office.
- You're not going into my office.
- Oh, so it's in your office?
- He says it's in his office.
- I heard.
We'll be right back.
Do you need anything from your office?
You know what?
Get out of my bar.
You're underage, you shouldn't be here anyway.
Are you kidding?
I play here every week.
Not anymore, you don't.
Now you're just a kid without a guitar.
Yeah?
Well, now you're just the manager of a bar without maraschino cherries.
That guy is such a dick.
Right?
How's your Shirley Temple?
It's a fucking revelation, but I'm still pissed.
I'm gonna come back tomorrow, break in, and get my guitar.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I'm in.
Really?
That was fast.
It was.
If we're gonna keep doing shit like this together, maybe one of us should worry more.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Okay.
Andre, open the door.
Are you okay?
If you're dead, you should come out so we can talk about it.
What do you think?
He threw up for 20 minutes.
How did Ron beat us here?
We took the carpool lane.
Maybe he did, too.
But he's just one person.
Maybe he did anyway.
But that's a $491 ticket.
This is why we have to stop him.
He's out of control!
I'm gonna break the door down see if Andre needs to be stabbed in the head.
Whoa.
Hang on.
Obviously, I'll confirm he's undead first.
Still, hang on.
Just because he's undead doesn't mean he deserves to die.
Or is that how you think now that you're suckling off of Petra's bigoted teat?
First of all yikes.
And, I just think a lot of undead roaming the streets could lead to problems.
For instance Farmers' markets selling actual farmers.
And I'm just saying that we research living people to find out if they're bad before we kill them.
Shouldn't we give the same courtesy to the undead?
No!
They eat people.
So do I, Joel.
But I'm also much more than that.
And no matter how much good I'm doing, is that all you're ever gonna see?
No.
But you're not the same as As what?
One of those?
A zombie?
Maybe Andre is a good person who just wants to do good things.
Nobody deserves to die because of the way they were born.
Or reborn.
Oh You guys are still here.
Andre, how do you feel?
I feel great.
And hungry.
Andre, stop!
It doesn't have to go this way.
I'm starving.
What did you mean by, "It doesn't have to go this way"?
I meant you could've gone that way, up to your loft to get some sleep, or you could've gone that way to the kitchen to get some ginger ale.
We're doctors.
We can't not help people.
Thank you, but I am feeling much better now.
It might have been the raw kombucha that I made in my shed.
So Ron really didn't come by?
No.
And I can't believe I almost let another weirdo bite me.
Not even at a concert.
If Ron wasn't here where the hell did he go?
Hello, Ronald Richard Ruffin.
Welcome to our chair.
Why did you kidnap me?
Who are you?
We are nobody.
And everybody.
What?
I don't understand.
We believe Joel Hammond is a Knight of Serbia, and that he captured you because you are undead.
No, Joel is becoming a Knight, and yes, I am undead.
Oh.
Well.
Oh.
Okay.
What's wrong?
It's just We were going to stab you to see if you were alive or dead.
But now Oh, I'm sorry.
I ruined your moment.
Go ahead.
Stab me.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
I know, right?
We should call Mr. Poplovic.
He will be pleased.
That's what we thought when we bought him those jeans for his birthday.
- True.
- Not even a thank you.
- Bad boss?
- You have no idea.
Oh.
So, what's it like being undead?
It's fantastic.
It unlocks you.
You become fearless.
Does it make you feel powerful?
It makes you feel however you want to feel.
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
That sounds exciting.
Janko would you rather call Mr. Poplovic and spend the rest of your life working for a boss who doesn't value you, or The second one.
We did it.
Andre posted on Reddit that Ron's crazy and no one should let him bite them.
Huh.
Thank God!
He also said the CIA's hoarding crystals to power their psychic warriors.
What would crystals I read it.
It's silly.
It's mostly silly.
You'd think it's silly.
So, send the Reddit post to Petra, she'll think Ron's a phony, and you'll be the next Knight of Serbia.
Actually, I was thinking that maybe I shouldn't be a Knight.
What?
Why not?
I almost killed someone today because I thought it he was undead.
You're right.
I'm a bigot.
- Honey - No, it's true.
I judge people based on the strength of their pulse, rather than the strength of their character.
I don't wanna join a group that's gonna encourage that in me.
You are exactly the person who should be a Knight of Serbia.
What do you mean?
Well, you're self-aware and willing to change, and maybe you're the one who could fix their backwards 13th century bullshit thinking.
Maybe that's your purpose.
I like your version of me.
And you have my word that no matter what I say or do as a Knight I pledge my allegiance only to you.
And I'll do everything in my power to protect you.
And I solemnly vow to fulfill the duties of my Knighthood with unwavering fealty.
I shall vanquish the undead wherever they may be.
On land or sea or ice.
I vow to be vigilant and prepared for battle, at all times.
To face darkness without fear evil without trepidation.
I pledge to this Knight my steadfast support, no matter the hardship.
Even through loss of limb, organ or hair.
His trials shall be as my own, his enemies my enemies.
Hi, may take your order?
Would you rather be pulled through a large space slowly or a small space quickly?
I don't understand And should my time come to serve, I will respect my duties as rightful heir to the Knighthood, observing no holiday from my burdens, save the eve of Saint Swithin's day.
You guys want ketchup or mus  I hereby declare thee Sir Joel, Knight of Serbia.
My brave Knight.
I feel safer already.
What happens next?
We should pay a visit to the new Knight of Serbia.
You mean kill him, right?
Thought that was implied.
But, yes.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1  Many times I tried to tell you Many times I cried alone Always I'm surprised how well you Cut my feelings to the bone  Don't want to leave you really I've invested too much time To give you up that easy To the doubts That complicate your mind We belong to the light We belong to the thunder We belong to the sound of the words We've both fallen under Whatever we deny or embrace For worse or for better We belong, we belong We belong together   Make sure the caterer brings four kinds of sandwiches, but they should only charge us for three.
I'm helping them with a rental property.
I have a question.
The chocolate fountain will be here by nine.
- Did you - Yes, five tiers.
- Did you - Dark chocolate.
- Did you - The gummy bear and pretzel package.
So fucking happy right now.
The chardonnay hasn't arrived.
Did you call the distributor?
Okay.
Only finishing Joel's sentences.
Got it.
I'm messing with you.
I got a better price from another vendor.
It'll be here within the hour.
Guys, relax.
Everything's handled.
Thanks, Gary.
We're just nervous.
This launch party is super important.
- Super super important.
- Which is why  You don't want me there.
We just think carrying you around in a backpack is too risky.
But I did all the work.
I want to be in on the action.
I'm sorry, we can't.
Is Mr. Ball Legs going?
Buddy, don't be like that.
Fine.
Listen, I need to talk to you about my future.
Your future?
In the company.
I need more of a commitment from you guys.
- Or what?
You're going to walk away?
-  I got another job offer.
- What?
- What?
I didn't go looking for it, but it's an excellent shop, and they were impressed how I outmaneuvered them on the Thompson listing.
How could you leave?
I mean, no offense.
You've seen you.
I'd still live here, but my work is all phones and internet.
In 10 years, no one's going to have a body anymore.
I can't believe this.
After all we've done for you.
You mean kill me and eat my intestines?
After that.
All right, Gary.
What's it going to take to make you stay?
Some money for my niece, every month.
Vacation time.
Maybe drive me to Tahoe once a year, rent a boat.
Figure out a way to get me into a casino.
Look, details to be determined.
The point is if you want me to stay.
I need more of a commitment about my future.
He's a head on a table.
We have the upper hand.
We have all the hands.
I don't think what he's asking for is that unreasonable.
Damn.
Even tuna tastes better.
I can see why the Aztecs worshipped chocolate as a god.
That is not even close to being factually accurate.
So, what do we do with Gary?
I think we commit.
Tell him we're in it for the long haul.
Everybody wants clarity about their future, Joel.
Everybody.
Me.
You.
Me, me, me.
You want to talk about our future?
Since you brought it up, I didn't want to bug you, but any more thoughts about immortality?
Look at the prize you'd get.
It's a great prize.
And yet, you're not jumping in to claim it.
- Oh, my God.
- Sheila I love you more than anything in this world.
But you're not sure if you want to be with me forever.
Just say it.
I don't know if two people can be together forever.
What if love is only possible because life is fleeting?
That knowing it's going to end is the reason why people cling to each other.
So all that stuff about you not wanting to eat people or being afraid of your "Id", that wasn't the problem.
The problem was you weren't sure about us.
Sweetheart, I love you.
Stop saying that.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Happy launch party!
You guys are fighting.
Well, I brought tequila.
It always makes things better.
Or worse.
I appreciate you helping me get my guitar back.
That being said, hurry the fuck up.
Picking a lock is hard.
The website was incredibly misleading.
And these would make terrible Christmas gifts.
-  Car.
-  Shit.
- Shit!
- What?
I was supposed to get breakfast with Eric today.
I completely forgot.
Would've been helpful to have him here.
He could've been our lookout.
Or brought us breakfast.
I need to keep him away from this stuff.
I think it's sweet you're trying to protect him.
Okay, here.
Let me try.
I don't know if I'll be any better, but I'll definitely be less critical.
So What's the deal with you two, anyway?
Everyone keeps asking me that.
I like Eric.
I'm just not sure it's in a way the kids call amorous.
Maybe you should find out.
Maybe you should focus on opening the door.
Maybe you're just a badass when it comes to blowing shit up, but a coward when it comes to your personal life.
Maybe Actually, maybe.
Oh, I heard a click.
Who are you?
The cleaning crew.
I'm the cleaning crew.
We're going to have to see some ID.
Okay, here's the deal.
Dustin stole my friend's guitar and we need to get it back.
Dustin's an asshole.
He throws half-full cans of soda in the trash and he won't give me the Wi-Fi password.
You can get your guitar.
Also life's short, you should go for it with Eric.
It's a thin door.
I just don't want to fuck things up.
You guys.
Love doesn't always shout.
Sometimes it whispers.
Well, thanks for the advice Sonia Holloway.
That's the name of the cleaning company.
Right on.
It was nice to meet you, and when you're ready, we'll be ready to find you the home of your dream.
Because our dream is your dream home.
We're still working on the slogan, but we know it's gonna have the words "home" and "dream" in it.
We have a problem.
Is it that you can't love me for all eternity?
No, it's that I think it's possible the human condition requires the certainty of death, in order for us to be capable of unconditional love.
And that's not it.
Your undead Meals-on-Wheels woman, who, you said, promised not to leave her apartment, is in our living room.
And if she kills someone, no matter how great the rest of the party is, that's all anyone's gonna remember.
Fine, I'll go talk to her.
And your philosophical musings on love are bullshit.
You're just scared.
You were scared to get married.
You were scared to have a kid, and I'm tired of dragging you along.
So if you don't want to do this, then the hell with it.
So, how do you know the Hammonds?
Oh, Sheila changed my life.
Really?
Mine, too.
I was heading in the wrong direction, and she grabbed the wheel and steered me into birds.
Like, in a car?
What?
No.
Ah!
I see the problem.
No, we weren't running over birds.
That's not what she's about.
She helped me realize I should follow my dream and work with them.
Oh, that's lovely.
I used to sit all day in my recliner.
Now, thanks to Sheila, I want to stir things up, get shit done.
My neighbor won't turn down his music.
I'm gonna fuck him up.
You know what I'm saying?
Kind of.
Truthfully, you also kind of scare me.
Jean!
Tommy!
I didn't expect to see either of you here.
Someone named Gary invited us.
Yeah.
He said he wanted a good turnout to support you and Joel.
He's the best.
Excuse us one second.
You were supposed to stay in your apartment until we kill you.
Worst thing ever said by a Meal-on-Wheels volunteer.
I'm sorry.
It's harsh, but you promised.
Sweetheart, I'm only here to support you and Jesus, look at the ear lobes on that guy.
Why don't they pass those around on a tray?
Jean, Jean no.
This party must go smoothly, which means nothing undead, besides me, and now, you.
Hi, Sheila.
God dammit!
Ron, Jean.
Excuse us a minute.
Hi, nice Oh!
What are you doing here?
Remember how I wanted to turn people, and you and Joel told me it was a bad idea?
Well, you guys were right.
I turned two gentlemen, and now they are rampaging on an ill-conceived smorgasbord of death.
See?
You should have listened to us.
You're worse than Abby.
I am worse than Abby.
I also told them Joel is a Knight of Serbia, so at some point, they may try to kill him.
And I put my name on someone else's hostess gift.
Now, you know everything.
And when you're ready, we'll be ready.
Because your dream house is our dream, which we will dream until your dream comes true.
Until you get a house.
Nope, that's not it.
Joel.
Okay, there's a man here that I would like to get to know better, ideally with less clothes on, but he said he wants to buy a house.
And since it's your party, I'm putting your needs first.
- Thank you.
- For five minutes, and then I am coming back in with everything blazing.
Man.
- Party's going great, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
I wish I could enjoy it more.
I hurt Sheila's feelings, and I don't know if I can fix it.
Oh.
He's in the garage and now you're down to four minutes.
Got it.
Hello, I understand you Why, hello, Mr. Hammond.
Mr. Poplovic.
It'd be so cool if you're here because you wanna buy a house.
Sorry, but I'm here because I know it's you who is undead.
You're making a mistake.
Am I?
I followed you this morning Mr. Hammond.
I saw your storage unit.
I know it's you.
Unless Okay.
You're right.
I'm undead.
Now what?
You going to shoot me?
Better make it count.
Otherwise, I'm going to tear out your neck.
- How's it going?
-  How are ya?
I'm not gonna shoot you.
But I will shoot everyone else in this room if you don't come quietly with me.
One party.
One successful party.
That's all I wanted.
But it feels successful.
Food's good.
Everyone mingling.
I heard some new jokes.
No.
It's ending on a bad note.
Lisa.
Have you seen Joel?
Yes, I introduced him to a potential client because I'm wonderful, and I sacrifice my own needs for others.
Yay, me!
Anyway, they left together.
Wait.
Who was it?
A man with an unusual name.
Something like David Popsicle?
It's not that, but I feel like that's close enough that he might respond to it.
- Dobrivoje Poplovic?
- Oh, that's it.
Poplovic.
The guy from the Consulate.
I've a headache.
So I'm gonna go home and take a Valium.
But if my speech isn't too impaired, I may come back.
Oh, my God.
Joel's been taken.
I know where Poplovic probably has him.
I was kidnapped there yesterday.
Hm I've been kidnapped twice this week.
I hope it's not one of those things that comes in threes.
I'm going to find him.
Do you want me to come with?
Fair warning.
While I am braver than I was I am still a huge coward.
No, you stay here.
Text me the info.
And make sure everyone has drinks.
And make sure they try the creamy onion casserole.
What's going on?
Someone took Joel.
Sheila went to find him.
- Alone?
- I offered.
You're trying to weaponize the virus.
- Is that what this is about?
- No.
- You're lying!
- No.
- You wanna create an undead army.
- No.
You're lying!
All right, I'll tell you if you promise not to tell anyone else.
I'm kidding.
You're never gonna talk to anyone else.
We'll see about that.
Okay.
You were saying.
The Serbian government sponsored my initial research, as they feared a modern-day plague.
But soon, I found something of far greater value.
You're gonna sell the virus to the highest bidder!
- No.
- Really?
Closer?
I'm not after the virus that causes the undead.
I'm after the dark necrofluid that runs through their veins.
The black goo?
Why?
Because I discovered it can stop cells from aging.
The promise of eternal youth.
The beauty industry has been chasing it forever, but now I can provide it at a price.
And all I need is a steady supply of the undead.
Who you'll imprison and harvest like farm animals!
You know what?
I should just stop guessing.
No, that's exactly right.
I knew it!
And it all starts with you.
Son of a bitch!
You're bleeding.
Ha!
There are no undead.
You're not gonna be rich.
I'm Roy Eastman Kodak, a medieval scholar from a local University!
Impossible.
But if it's not you then who is it?
Hey, hey!
You can't just walk in here.
- I've gotta get to the basement.
-  Whoa, whoa.
Honey, honey.
That's not gonna happen.
Come on.
A handsome man like you.
A lady like me.
A sexy lobby like this.
- All right, come on.
Let's go.
- Wait.
One second.
Here's $200.
Is that a bribe?
It's not a bribe.
It's to pay for your nose.
Hey!
Hey!
This is Evan.
Ground floor, we have a breach.
- Who are you protecting?
- No one.
Must be someone you care about very much.
No.
Now you're the one making wrong guesses.
Makes you feel bad about yourself, huh?
Makes you feel a little dumb?
It's someone you're willing to risk everything for.
Someone who, perhaps, would also risk everything for you.
Mm.
Perfect.
- Joel!
- Sheila, no!
Hi, there.
I believe your someone is here to rescue you.
Mmm.
And here she is.
My Queen Bee.
Hello.
Fuck you.
Never be mean to the man who's going to determine the size of your cage.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to arrange your transport.
Where are you taking us?
Oh, I won't be taking you anywhere, because I'm going to kill you.
If that wasn't clear.
I mean, afterwards, I may move your body, but from your perspective You get it.
Love my dad so much right now.
-  -  Abby?
In here!
What's going on?
You blew me off last night, you blew me off for breakfast.
And now you're dipping things into a chocolate fountain and you didn't call me?
I was going to call you.
I just got home.
Oh, please.
Like you started with the sandwich.
Are you mad at me?
- No.
- Then what's going on?
I just I am trying to keep you away from the chaos in my life.
Abby, most of your life is chaos.
If I'm not in that I'm not in it.
You are going to go to MIT or someplace amazing and do amazing things, and I am trying to protect that for you.
Well, who asked you to?
Your mom.
Oh.
It's a rhetorical question.
But she's right.
I don't want you to do something with me that could fuck up your future.
I can make my own decisions.
Do you remember how pissed you were when your parents tried to protect you from their world?
Do you?
Yes.
Don't do that to me.
I spend most of my life being afraid.
Now I'm not.
As much.
Don't put me back in that box.
Okay?
Okay.
From now on, I promise I will ruin your life.
Thank you.
Hello.
We are Janko and Radul.
Is Joel Hammond home?
Are you here for the Hammond Realty launch party?
Yes.
That string of words.
Well, the party's over and he's not here.
But if you leave me - your number - It's okay.
No problem.
We will wait.
Guys, you can't just walk in like this.
- You're not the boss of us.
- No.
We don't like to be bossed.
Our last boss will be dead soon.
Maybe.
We don't know.
Life.
So random.
So Joel Hammond.
He's a Knight of Serbia, correct?
I've never heard that term.
Will you excuse us?
We have something in the oven we need to check on.
- Both of you?
- It's a lasagna and it's heavy.
Are you hungry?
I could eat.
Them.
That's funny.
Why do you always say, "That's funny" and you never just laugh.
Okay, someone needs to eat them.
That's funny.
I think I can make my way up this thing.
But even if I get to the end, there is a large handle that would be very unpleasant to pull through my body.
Hang on.
This chair isn't bolted to the ground.
If I rock it back and forth, maybe I can loosen these restraints.
It's working!
Aw.
This is gonna be a really shitty position to die in.
What did Poplovic mean when he called me his Queen Bee?
He's gonna make you bite other people and then harvest you all for your goo, because it prevents aging, and he can sell it for a shit ton of money.
Why can't people just age gracefully?
I'm so sorry about all this.
It's not your fault.
I thought I had some big purpose.
A gift that could help people.
Look where my gift got us.
You're going to die and I'm going to be a queen.
Wait, that sounds better than it is.
- A goo sac.
There we go.
-  No.
It can't end like this.
It can't.
I didn't help anybody.
Now no one can help us.
Stay right there!
Drop the crossbow!
-  -  This is so freaking cool.
I have a scar.
From battle.
I think the bullet is still inside me.
I'm going to literally rip this man a new asshole.
No, Jean.
We're not here to make new assholes.
Now, let's move.
That guy has blood on his shoe.
They're undead.
They're here to kill my dad.
Shit!
What do we do?
You should run.
I'm not leaving you.
She's right.
You should have run.
There is no heavy lasagna.
You guys are going to kill us, right?
That's the plan.
Well I guess there's nothing we can do.
- What?
- Oh, Eric.
That's what Janko wants.
And clearly Janko's the boss.
Yes.
Janko's the boss.
Whatever he says goes.
What makes you think Janko is the boss?
He has a strong presence.
He's confident.
- You submit to him.
- He treats you like garbage.
Which, frankly, is hard to watch.
Radul Don't you see what they're doing?
They're realizing that someone has to be in charge and it should be me.
Why can't I be in charge?
Because I'm more qualified.
Even the girl saw that.
I think I should be given a chance.
I'll be in charge for the first 500 years, then, if we remember, we can have a discussion.
Now!
Okay, I use it.
Now I see the plan.
You killed Radul.
He was my friend.
Now, I'm the boss of nothing.
Hey!
Zombie!
You mindless goon.
You're really gonna kill the girl first?
Come on, loser.
No one kills the girl first.
Also, my mom says I'm a delicious boy.
Very well.
I can start with you.
Run, Abby, run!
Always kill the girl first.
Fuck!
I'm sorry about the whoopsie with the knife.
It's okay.
You were awesome just now.
Fearless.
You think?
Referring to myself as "a delicious boy" wasn't exactly an Indiana Jones moment.
No.
Even better.
It was an Eric Bemis moment.
I did it!
I got my leg free!
Go, honey!
Is it helping?
No.
We're looking to buy a house.
Anyone here who can help us?
Oh, my God!
We can!
What's happening?
Is that Tommy?
And Jean and Ron!
Thank God.
Hurry!
Unstrap me.
I mean help Sheila first, but I am unbelievably uncomfortable.
I can't believe you guys came for us.
Of course, sweetheart.
When you bit me, you saved my life.
I'm not gonna let you die.
Me neither.
Not after everything you've done for me.
We believe in you, Sheila.
- Really?
- Totally.
We're like a cult but without uniforms.
Wait.
Why don't we all get uniforms?
Guys, come on.
We gotta move quick.
There's security everywhere.
Right.
By the way, is that my crossbow?
No, it's my crossbow.
You mean the one that's mine, that you found in my house?
Give it.
I told you this was going to be an issue.
We have no time for his.
Give him the damn crossbow.
And let's get out of here.
We have to go find Poplovic.
No.
We have to leave.
You were stabbed with a lance.
I tipped over.
No one is 100% here.
He knows who we are.
He knows where we live.
He's gonna come after us.
We have to kill him.
I agree.
But not now.
Now, we have to survive.
Come on.
That's close enough, Miss Hammond.
You're not going to kill your Queen Bee.
I will, if you come any closer.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Why don't you join me?
We can be partners.
I can give what's happened to you some purpose.
My life has purpose.
And it doesn't include you, David Popsicle.
Dobrivoje Poplovic, Dobrivoje Poplovic, Dobrivoje Poplovic.
Is that so hard?
Anyway, now you're gonna die.
For the last time.
Wait.
Here's $40.
For what?
Your funeral.
Now let's go home.
It's Abby.
Abby!
Abby?
Are you all right?
Where are you?
Kitchen.
Hello, role models.
Thank God, you're okay.
I'm fine.
So is Eric.
The bodies are in the garage, wrapped up and ready for the desert.
Did you guys take care of Poplovic?
Yeah.
It's over.
And you killed Janko and Radul.
And cleaned the house?
They were coming for you, Dad.
And then I started thinking, we're this team now.
We have to watch out for each other.
Have each other's backs.
And then the next thing I knew, I was piling dishes into the sink.
What have you people done to me?
I'm just still trying to wrap my head around the idea that my sugar plum stabs people in the brains, but we're proud.
You are very brave.
You are an amazing girl who Oh, my God!
Is using soap on my iron skillet?
- I'm soaking it.
- You're killing it.
Time keeps on coming I've been all around I'll keep on running What's going on?
I don't know.
I thought maybe we could try to find out.
Now you're back in your hideout Everyone was talking to ya To ya There you go, sweetie.
Who's a good boy who stayed in our closet all day?
Did you miss Mama?
Can you say Mama?
Say Mama?
Hey.
Hey.
How'd it go?
I always wonder if it's better to bury two bodies in one place or spread them around.
I'm sure there's a right answer, but I never want to meet the person who knows it.
I've been thinking about our fight this morning.
Me too.
I realized after being captured that the end will always come horribly for the undead.
We don't get to die peacefully in our sleep or surrounded by loved ones.
For us, the end will always be violent, merciless.
Or with men like Poplovic, there will be no end, only suffering.
- Sheila - I don't want that for you.
I want you to live a normal life and die in my arms.
No.
You were right.
Becoming undead does scare me.
But when I thought I was gonna die, what scared me most was that I'd never see you again.
We can wait till Abby goes to college or whatever, but after today I never want to live or die without you.
- Honey - Please.
Sheila Hammond will you take this man to be your husband for the next 1000 years or so?
What about all the undead stuff that freaks you out, like eating people or unleashing your "Id"?
Or this guy?
It's gonna be weird!
Especially throwing up one of those.
- I think you're scaring him.
- I don't care.
I don't care about any of it.
I love you.
That's all that matters.
So, bring it on!
As long as we're together, I can handle whatever comes my way.
Ah.
Not a spider guy.
Oh, my God!
Where did he  Honey, honey!
Joel!
Mama.
Joel.
Joel!
No!
No!
Joel.
Hello.
- Really digging the uniforms.
- Yeah, see?
Yes, they're lovely, but where are we going?
- To save the world, Jean.
- For Sheila.
For Sheila!
Okay.
