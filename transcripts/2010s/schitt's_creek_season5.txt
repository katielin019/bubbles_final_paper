{START OF EPISODE 1}
Johnny: Kids!
Your mother's on the phone, and it's her first day on set, so let's all make sure we keep her spirits high, okay?
Alexis, come on.
Mr. Rose, I think you should answer it.
Yeah, she's over there all by herself, so it's gotta be stressful, right?
- I mean, the jet lag, and - Oh my God, answer the phone!
- That's why-that's why - Answer the phone, please!
Put her on speaker, how do you put her on speaker?
- Arghhh!
- Speaker, speaker.
Yeah, hello?
Moira?
- - Moira: John?
Hello?
Hello?
Moira?
David, I don't think she can hear me!
John, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here, everybody's here.
I expected to hear from you yesterday.
Kids, say hi to your mother.
- Hey.
- Hi - She-she's not my mother.
- Who are those voices?
Uh, your children!
Oh Alexis, do you have strep again?
- That was David!
- Is that Stevie?
Hi.
David!
Oh, David, how's the store?
Any new customers, or is it still friendless?
Okay, thank you.
And John, I know disoriented you get in my absence.
Don't forget I left you that Sudoku book.
Yeah, well, I haven't needed it sweetheart, because I've been up since 5:00am, there's so much to do here at the motel.
But listen, how are you doing?
I mean, how does it feel to be back in the saddle?
Oh John, there's a sweetness in the air, and I'm not just saying that because we shoot next to a baklava factory.
Kids!
Do you wanna put those magazines back, please?
!
No.
Excellent, Hamza!
Darlings, I must sign off.
I'm finally getting my tete-a-tete with the director.
He's some up-and-coming pretty young thing out of New York.
Well, sounds like your kind of people.
Yes!
You come up with some real money, you can attract the best.
Well, zbogom, John!
That's goodbye in the mother tongue!
Okay, well, I'll sign off too, sweetheart.
Lots to do, but wishing you an exciting  Okay, yep.
Miss you, too.
She already hung up.
Oh!
Burn, Dad!
Oh my God that's so embarrassing, you must feel ridiculous.
You better remember which nails you pulled those wigs from, because your mother keeps a spreadsheet.
- David?
Come here, please.
-  - I have a concern.
- Oh!
Um, no.
Your natural deodorant isn't working.
Stop, David!
No, come here.
- Sit!
- What?
- Um - What?
!
I just wanted to make sure that everything was okay between you and Patrick.
Yeah!
Why?
Why?
What did what did he say to you?
No, nothing.
I just got scared when I saw your score on this relationship quiz.
Oh my God!
Because according to M'Lady Magazine, "How Electric is your Relationship" quiz from summer 1991, you and Patrick are "In Need of a Generator"!
Poor thing!
Okay, first of all, it's Major Lady Magazine, and second of all, that quiz is garbage.
Mm, totally, David.
This garbage quiz that it looks like you took more than once.
Yeah, because it's rigged.
You could take it 1000 times you'd still get the same outcome.
Oh, it's okay, David.
You and Patrick have settled in to that like, nine to five life, so things are probably starting to feel a little snooze-town.
You're dating a vet who irons his polo shirts.
Um, Ted and I got "Electrical Storm".
So.
That's impossible.
What did you do to get that?
Did you plug your hairdryer in with wet hands again?
Hey, that happened twice David, let it go.
Sorry that we work hard to keep the sparks flying.
That's disgusting.
We've actually started taking every Friday afternoon off to go on "adventure dates".
"Adventure dates" sound like something a marriage counselor would proscribe as a last resort.
Okay, fine I was gonna see if you guys wanted to join us this afternoon, but you probably have more exciting things to do, like put price tags on things, and It's merchandising day, actually.
Oh!
Where are you going, anyway?
Ted booked a tour of Elm Falls Park, which is like, a super cute look for us.
Sounds dumb.
Fine, text me the information, and I'll see if we're interested.
Oh!
David?
It could be worse.
You guys could be a "Total Power Failure".
Mm!
Eat glass.
Caw!
Caw!
My teamster brethren!
Yes, it's me, if you can believe it!
Okay, I told the producers I would approve background on set.
Oh!
And I shall tell them the same.
You must be Blaire.
No last name.
Doctor Clara Beatrice Mandrake at your service.
Middle name wasn't scripted, but I've done my homework.
Okay.
So, you're Rose, then?
Moira Rose.
And I see what's happening here.
Break me down just to build me up again!
Like Stan Kubrick did to Shelley.
Okay, I'm not really into games, and I'm due on set in an hour, so can whatever this is can wait 'til then?
I imagine script revisions might be something you'd like to sign off on before the first clap of the boards.
There's a problem with the script?
Well, just a few character adjustments.
I'm kidding.
The script's a total dumpster fire, of course.
Hah!
If the script were garbage, I don't believe we'd have signed on.
It's an apocalyptic fantasy about mutant crows.
I think we all know what we're making here.
A timely allegory about prejudice.
- Okay, Maura, is it?
- Moira.
My last picture was a $50 million dollar studio project.
I think it's safe to say that this is not that.
And what exactly is this to you, then?
A trip to Bora Bora.
I see.
Bora Bora.
Caroline Kennedy once called it the Atlantic City of French Polynesia.
Okay, let's just cash our paychecks, and pray no one ever sees this, yeah?
- Morning, Stevie.
I'm just here to submit my letter of resignation.
Okay, you can just leave it right here on the desk.
Well, I haven't actually written it yet.
But I guess I can just dictate it to you right now.
Um, "To whom it may concern".
Sorry Roland, why exactly are you quitting?
Well, I would rather quit than come in here every day and be humiliated!
I mean, I come to work, and Johnny's out there doing all my jobs!
Yeah, he's been buzzing around - ever since Mrs. Rose left.
- Yeah, exactly!
I mean, come on, what's next?
I go home and he's playing strip backgammon with my wife?
Come on!
- No, don't talk to me.
- Yeah.
I-I mean, I look in the mirror and it's Johnny's face staring back at me?
Got it, Roland.
I'll talk to him.
Okay, well, I'll go with you.
Oh, look!
This guy's wearing a work shirt.
He's even copping my look now!
Uh What ya doin' there, Mr. Rose?
Oh, I noticed there was a bit of blockage in the gutters.
But um Roland's in charge of doing the gutters.
Yeah, I'm the gutter guy, Johnny.
Everybody knows I'm the gutter guy!
Well, it was on the to-do list for today.
Yeah, it was on my to-do list!
What are you gonna do next, the bathrooms?
!
No, I haven't done the bathrooms.
Jeez, I wouldn't mind if he did the bathrooms.
Uh, is everything okay, Mr. Rose?
Yeah, never felt better.
I feel invigorated!
Well, maybe you can move on to cleaning the windows, and give Roland his job back?
Well, I've already done the windows.
It looks like Roland might have to find some other work.
Oh jeez.
Find some other work, do you hear him?
What's gonna happen next?
I go to my dermatologist, and Johnny's there getting my moles checked?
Stevie: Point made Roland, thank you.
- Oh hi.
- Hi.
Have I ever told you how sexy it is to walk in here and see you doing um inventory?
And wearing those little rubber thimbles on your fingers?
They help me flip the pages easier.
Hot.
Hot sex.
You know what else is hot and sexy?
Doing something spontaneous this afternoon.
Ooh, like what?
You helping me with the inventory?
Yes.
Or taking the afternoon off.
Mixing up the nine to five.
Okay well, nine to five are our store hours.
So it's kinda hard to build customer loyalty when your store is just like, spontaneously open or closed.
Yeah.
Anyway, it turns out Alexis's relationship is in trouble.
- What?
- Yeah, I know.
Struggling.
She practically begged us to join them at the park this afternoon, probably for emotional support.
Wow, we just saw them, they seemed totally fine.
I know.
Yeah.
Well, they're in need of a generator, if you know what I mean.
Well, I don't, but uh if you think it'll help a bad situation, I guess we could duck out a little early today.
It will just mean we'll have to start early tomorrow.
Mhmm.
You know, it's that unshakable sense of responsibility that makes me wanna just rip those little rubber things, and burn 'em in a fire.
Johnny: Twyla, can I get a lunch special to go, please?
- Sure.
- Okay.
Oh!
So no one thought to tell me about the team lunch today?
Oh, we tried.
You just couldn't hear us over the sound of the lawnmower.
Yeah, lawnmower, as in mowing the lawn, which is also my job.
Am I supposed to be reading between the lines here?
Well, I think we were just wondering if maybe the fact that you're so invigorated to work lately is because Mrs. Rose is gone, and you're trying to fill a Fill a big, black empty hole in your life.
Is that pretty much what you were trying to say there, Stevie?
Maybe not quite like that, but Okay, if you're suggesting that my work ethic has anything to do with Oh, it's Moira!
I gotta to take this.
Moira, what's the good word?
Oh John, I'm afraid I've made a grave error in judgment.
Oh sweetheart, I told you not to drink the tap water.
If only!
At this moment an intestinal bacteria would wreak less havoc on my career!
Well, I don't understand.
Everything was fine two hours ago.
John, you know me, I'm never one to complain.
I didn't bat an eye when I found out my accommodation here was in actuality a small "Bed or Breakfast".
They feed me at work, I'll take the bed.
So then what's the problem?
Our director appears to be on a kamikaze mission to sink this ship, and I refuse to be the goddess on its prow!
Well, if you're not enjoying yourself anymore sweetheart, then coming home is always an option.
I mean, you must be missing your family.
Oh, thank you, John, but that's not it.
This was supposed to be my comeback vehicle, and opportunities like this come along ever so infrequently.
Well, Moira, I feel the answer is right in front of you.
This isn't some rinky-dink made-for-TV movie, or a voice gig for an X-rated Japanese video game.
That-that was rated "M" for "Mature," John.
All I'm saying is you have an opportunity here.
And if you want it bad enough, you've gotta fight for it.
You're right.
You're right!
If Sandy Bullock hadn't fought to keep the Speed Franchise alive, we never would've had "Cruise Control".
John, thank you.
I would be lost without you.
Me too.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's good, Stevie.
Everything's good.
So I'm gonna head back, uh, but you can brainstorm some things for Roland to do.
And if not, I have a window later, so I can take the job on if you like.
Just so you're aware, Mr. Rose, the special is cream of mushroom soup.
We don't actually have to-go containers for that, so I've just double-bagged it.
Would you like a spoon, or a straw?
I have to say, David, I'm a little shocked that you agreed to do this, I know how fearful you are of heights.
Hmm.
Well, "fearful" makes me sound like some Dickensian orphan with a chronic illness.
It's more an aversion.
Yeah, do I wish that Alexis was a little more specific when she said we were coming to a park?
Uh maybe, but this, this is gonna be fun, I think for us.
- You know?
- Yeah.
David, you look so cute under there!
Like a tiny toadstool man, or a little acorn person, or something.
Hey!
So glad you guys could make it!
I hope you didn't have to like, rearrange your daily schedule, or anything, hm?
Oh, no, no, no, we just agreed to finish doing the inventory tomorrow.
Mm, that's a sensible decision.
Yeah.
They look like they're really enjoying each other's company.
Yeah, they fake it well.
I actually did one of these at summer camp.
Yeah, and I couldn't imagine who wouldn't want to dangle 20 feet in the air on a series of shaky logs.
It's actually closer to 30 feet, bud.
David's never done anything like this before.
- Uh oh, we've got a virgin!
- Okay, you might wanna talk to half my birthright trip about that.
All right, do you wanna go first, babe?
- Hundred, babe.
- Oh okay, there we go!
Hey.
Mm!
All right.
You feeling okay, David?
You're looking a little flushed.
No, just using a new tinted moisturizer, that's all.
It's all right.
- I guess I'll go.
-  All right!
This will be a fun adventure for us.
Yes Get the clip off, and you're ready to go.
- Babe!
- Whoa, great job, babe!
David!
David!
- Stop!
None of my phone chargers are working!
I ask for a pressed juice, and all I get are blank stares.
Look, I just find it hard to believe that this was the best gig you could've gotten me.
Get my days down!
Yeah.
Hi.
- Hello, again.
- Hi.
I was hoping this might be an opportune moment to discuss the quagmire in which you fancy yourself ensnared?
The what to the what now?
I suspect you're viewing this enterprise as a barrier rather than a gateway to the future of your career.
Yeah, you really don't have to worry - about the future of my career.
- Is that so?
Because I did a little "Ask Jeeves-ing," and you, Sir, were recently cut loose from a high-profile blockbuster.
We had artistic differences.
You were the artist, and they were indifferent!
Yes, well, nothing is a sure thing in this business.
Nothing is a sure thing.
Which is why you should look at every opportunity as a pearl in an un-shucked oyster.
I would hardly call this an opportunity!
I-I worked in soaps.
They had me play my own father, who then became pregnant despite the vasectomy.
I still hold the record for the longest-running demonic possession on daytime television.
Okay, what's your point?
We were number one.
Every project has potential.
If you allow yourself to see it, and give it the respect it deserves, others just may follow suit.
Yeah, I really wouldn't know where to start with this one.
Hmm, well, here are my revisions.
If you care to discuss them, I'll be running lines in the nest.
Hey Stevie, don't mind me.
Just coming in for a quick cup of rocket fuel.
Nobody drinks that rocket fuel, Mr. Rose.
I know it tastes like something I found in that gutter out there, but uh it's the pick-me-up I need to finish reorganizing the shed.
You're reorganizing the shed?
That's not on the calendar 'til next week.
Yeah well, with my evenings free, I mean, normally at this time Moira and I are deciding on dinner plans, but uh Okay, Mr. Rose, I know I might be overstepping here, but I just wanted you to know that it's okay to miss your wife.
No, it's just an adjustment, that's all.
I mean, we're making adjustments all the time.
Yesterday I couldn't drink this coffee, and now we've been serving this to guests the whole time?
Mr. Rose, I-I hope that someday I find someone who I can stand long enough to feel a little lost when they're not around.
I'm exhausted.
Eight days, Stevie.
That's the longest we've gone without seeing each other.
No matter where we were, and yeah, we've managed to keep it up for almost 40 years.
Well, see?
It makes sense that you're a little out of sorts without her.
I'll tell you what's not out of sorts anymore, that shed!
Yeah well, now that you're done with the shed, maybe you could start sharing the jobs with Roland again?
Yeah well, you're right, Stevie, and I will call Roland.
It's just I'm so tired From all the work I've been doing, so I'm thinking maybe you could No, it's just not my job.
Right.
Patrick: You can do this, David!
Just one step at a time!
You're looking pretty shaky there, David.
I really hope we didn't "rope" you into something here.
Alexis: Hey David, just pretend you're in like, a super dangerous walk-and-turn sobriety test.
Okay, I don't like this!
Okay well then, just turn around!
Why would he agree do this when he's afraid of heights?
He's not afraid of heights, He's afraid of moths and butterflies.
And businesswomen in sneakers.
Okay, I can hear you!
And also heights, something to do with him being broken up with while he was Parasailing in the Seychelles!
He and Anderson Cooper were stuck up there for like, three hours, until the wind died down.
I totally forgot!
Argh!
- I'm sorry, David!
- Aah!
I'm sorry, you were right, the quiz was rigged.
- What?
!
- What quiz?
Okay, David took this relationship quiz, and it said that his relationship was like, in need of some excitement.
- What?
!
- David, I lied!
I took the quiz like, 15 times.
"In Need of a Generator" is like, the only answer you can get.
Oh my God!
Okay, I don't know what this is about, but this generator is running smoothly.
So we're doing all of this so that you can prove our relationship is exciting?
I failed the stupid quiz, and Alexis made me feel bad about it.
David, you're basically 40 years old, I shouldn't be able to make you feel bad about anything.
I love our relationship.
I love it when you order me pizza.
I love when you use words like inventory!
I even love those stupid rubber things you put on your fingers, 'cause you think they flip the pages faster.
They don't flip the pages faster.
They don't flip the pages faster!
- Okay - I'm so sorry!
We're gonna talk about the fact that we missed half a day of work to make this happen, But you did just do a tree walk 30 feet in the air for us.
- Yes, I did.
- Both: Muah!
-  - All right, guys, that's one rope down, seven courses to go.
- Hey.
- Don't touch me.
No.
My dear murder, soon we will walk once more walk amongst the humans.
But until that day comes, we must remember, the crows don't just have eyes we also have wings!
Caaaaw!
Awk!
Caw!
Caw!
- Cut!
Cut.
-  Let me guess, he didn't like the rewrites, I don't know why, or really, even how, but something about this actually works.
Oh.
All right then, then um might I ask why did we interrupt that take?
Right, so at this point Moira, I'm gonna have a bunch of digital birds sort of circling around you, so if you can just be aware of them.
Yes.
Aye, Captain.
Note taken.
Let's pick it up from there.
In terms of my eye-line, how many birds am I clocking?
And of them, how many are mutants?
Okay, winging it.
Action!
Listen to me aaawk!
The day will come when we are no longer social outcasts!
I am but a tail-feather away from finding the cure.
So please quiet your caws so that we may take up our cause redemption!
Redemption!
Awk!
Awk!
Ahaaa!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Moira: John!
Are you awake?
- John!
- What?
What's happening?
Your wayfaring thespian has returned!
I-I don't wanna jinx anything, but the shoot was a triumph.
The local Bosnians are calling it a stunning re-invigoration of the "Crows Have Eyes" franchise.
That, of course, is a loose translation.
Oh, well that sounds great, sweetheart.
John, no need to get out of bed, dear.
I'm sure you considered planning a little more fanfare for my return, but oh, it's best to ease back in.
It's 3:30 in the morning, you said you were coming in today at noon.
Yes!
Noon Bosnian Mountain Time, that is!
Which was several hours ago, John.
Oh, and what a journey it has been!
Production had me routed through Nairobi for some reason, and then our plane was grounded after flying through a swarm of locusts.
I didn't want to miss my third connection, so I took a Bosnian upper just to keep awake.
Those things are the size of a nickel, so I only took one, at least, I think I did.
I may have taken a second one just to be safe, because I don't know if I took that first one, or not.
Either way, I've been up since eight am three days ago, with time changes factored in, and I couldn't be happier to see you!
Oh!
Well Moira, it sounds like a nightmare of a trip.
Why don't we leave the unpacking 'til tomorrow, and just get some rest?
Good idea.
Kids!
- No Moira, it's 3:30.
- David!
Alexis!
- Oh!
Who is it?
- Oh my God, what?
!
I don't know what you kids are still doing up so late.
I didn't want to disturb you, I just wanted you to know that Mummy got home safe and sound!
- Okay, good night.
- Great.
Okay, if you insist, one quick story.
So, day three of shooting, Hamza and I find ourselves stuck in a hail storm Oh my God, not tonight, thank you, though.
I'm sorry kids, your mother's had a rough couple of days.
Moira, why don't we get to bed, sweetheart?
Ooh, frisky, John.
- Oh!
Bye!
- Ewww!
- Eww.
- Ugh!
Moira: No!
No one would believe this!
These cannot be real!
What's going on?
Well, instead of sleeping last night, I decided to just power right through.
You know, best to round up to an even four days.
And while I was doing some light reorganization, I came upon this stack of love letters written to your father by another woman.
- Okay.
- Best not to be concerned, Alexis.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation for all of this.
- Sure there is.
- Yes.
Some of them!
Some of them are even funny!
Listen.
Where's that one?
Oh!
Read this.
"Dearest John-John, I'm lying here, stuck, sweaty.
All I can think about is you, and the last night we spent together, bed shaking " Ew!
Why are you making me read this?
- I know, right?
- Eugh!
Before your father met me, he was not quite so selective.
I hesitate to add, he even had a predilection for boom boom girls!
Okay, I would like to remind you that I don't have a therapist anymore.
No, as you said, there's a logical explanation for all of this.
No, you've said that like, three times now.
So I think it's probably for the best that we put these down, and we go have a nap, okay?
- Yes.
You're right.
- Mhm.
You're right, Alexis, you're always so right.
Okay.
All right  Just a few more, just to lull me to sleep.
That's all.
Good morning.
Is there something I can help you with?
Yeah, I'd like you to open your cash register, and give me your money!
Okay, small problem.
Um, our money isn't for sale.
- I'm robbing you!
- Thought so, yeah.
Um I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Hey!
Hey!
Where do you think you're going?
!
- Here.
- David: So here's the problem.
Our till doesn't currently have any cash in it, because my partner is at the bank getting money for the float.
What about you, what do you have?
A wallet full of debt.
Can someone put something in a bag, please?
!
Um, we only have cloth totes, I hope that's okay.
- Whatever!
- Would you like some wine?
Okay, yeah, yes, put some booze in a bag.
Do you drink red wine, or white wine?
Maybe some chilled rose in the back?
I'll get it!
Robber: I'm not letting you go into the back!
What else?
Cheese goes good with wine.
Suddenly she's a sales associate.
Would you like some cheese?
Uh yeah, I'll take some cheese.
God forbid he be specific.
I guess throw in some brie, some aged cheddar.
Uh, that tapenade goes good with the brie.
Tapenades, great, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Do you have bad skin?
- Yeah, sure, just hurry it up!
There you go.
Could you help the man with the door?
- His hands are full.
- Sorry.
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.
Why do I feel like we did something wrong?
Look at you all dressed up, Mr. Sporty Spice.
Uh yeah, I'm dressed for the run that we're supposed to be going on, but I don't think you can run in those.
Tell that to me at 21, escaping the yakuza.
So that's a no on the run, then?
Okay, honestly Ted, I've had a very traumatic morning at home, so going on a run is like, the last thing that I wanna do.
Also, I forgot.
Okay well, that's actually like, scary, because we texted about it twice last night, and twice this morning, but anyway, is everything okay?
Like, other than reading some very porny love letters that someone sent my dad, sure.
Like, who holds on to things like that?
I've held on to some things.
Oh my God, should I be worried?
Well, I, I did keep this waterproof watch that Heather gave me.
Okay, I asked if I should be worried.
I don't know, I think it's kind of romantic to hang on to things from old relationships.
I've certainly kept some things from our past.
Ted!
I take it that you haven't?
Um, harsh.
I for sure have.
Yeah, it's just that your face is doing some really weird stuff right now.
No because you put me on the spot!
There's like, a very long list of things that I've kept.
Oh, really.
Like what?
Like that empty book that you gave me.
- The journal?
- Yes!
The journal.
And very likely some jewelry.
Like a ring, or - A locket?
- Yes.
The locket you gave me.
I kept that the most.
Oh yeah, it's just funny, I don't think I've ever seen you wear it.
I'm just so scared of losing it.
That makes sense.
Okay, well, you have a run to go on, so I should probably go and update my journal.
You've never written in a journal, have you?
No, but um, one time I did do a book report on David's diary, and it was very dark.
Okay.
Jocelyn!
Moira, you're back.
Did you just let yourself in?
I have been knocking on your door since the beginning of time!
Although now that I'm standing here, it's equally possible that I didn't knock at all.
I suppose we'll never know, will we?
Ah!
Sorry.
I just need to - catch my breath.
- Oh, as do I. I don't know if you know what it's like to be mortally deprived of one's sleep!
I haven't slept in eight months.
- Why's that?
- Because of the baby.
I've had a bit of a rebirth myself, in Bosnia.
I hope it wasn't as painful as mine.
The music, Jocelyn.
In Bosni-wood, as the industry will soon be calling it, I I picked up some beautiful Sevdah, that I absolutely must teach to the Jazzigals!
Would you like to hear me sing a traditional love song?
I - I would, it's just the baby's sleeping, so Shhh   Yeah it's a sad one.
I would be feeling it too, if I knew what the heck you were singing about.
Oh What are these?
Oh, just some old love letters, written by another woman, onto which John has been clutching.
Wow, I have been down this road.
I once found a bag of Roland's ex-girlfriends' bras.
Burned them.
Except for the ones that were my size.
But this is incomparable, Jocelyn, there's a perfectly logical explanation for this!
Oh, there always is.
Woo!
Wow.
This little "butterfly" is quite the writer.
It's like 50 Shades of Johnny Rose!
Holy cow.
You know, I've never been robbed before, and I had friends that lived in Brooklyn.
Yeah that was a robbery, right?
I mean, we were robbed.
Right?
Yeah!
Someone walked out of here with two bags of product, I mean, I don't know what else you'd call it.
I mean, he had a weapon, right?
Yeah!
Yes.
I mean, it must've been in his pocket, because he used both hands to carry the bags out of the store, but I can't believe you just offered him the wine.
You offered him the skincare, I mean, we don't know what was going on under that mask!
He could've had perfect skin.
I can't believe this happened, I was gone for like, 45 minutes.
Are you guys sure you're okay?
Surprisingly, yes.
- Yeah, I'm not.
- Thanks.
I'm very startled.
It just doesn't make any sense.
I mean, I can understand taking the wine, but who steals a jar of tapenade?
- And the brie?
!
- Yeah, the brie.
Stevie?
The brie?
Well, at least we know if the cops don't get him, his cholesterol will.
Well, there's no need to keep talking about it now.
You guys are gonna have to go through this all again in much more detail when the police get here.
Yeah, I um, I don't know if going to the police is is necessary at this point.
If we want any insurance money for the things that were stolen, you have to explain everything to the police.
I was pretty much in the back while all of this was going down, so Mm, I remember you being pretty involved, actually.
Yeah well, between the two of you, I'm pretty sure you can piece it together.
Yeah.
Right?
So Hey, Twy?
I've always admired your jewelry game.
You just like, pick a few pieces, and just and wear them to death.
Oh, if you're talking about my earrings the clasp broke, so I actually physically cannot take them off.
Okay, I am experiencing the same problem.
All of my jewelry is boring.
Is that what I said?
So way back when, all of my girlfriends and I used to throw the diamonds we got from our parents on a table, and just do like, a big jewelry swap.
I wish I had someone in this town to swap with.
Yeah, I used to think that a lot growing up, when I'd see other kids with their families.
Okay, you just gave me a great idea!
Why don't we do a jewelry swap?
Well, I do have a large collection of my grandfather's hospital bracelets.
Yum!
Um, but I also love that cute little locket around your neck.
Well, that makes sense, because you gave it to me for Christmas, and I wear it every day.
Yeah, and I always think like, what would I look like in it?
S so do you want the locket?
No, Twy, I got it for you.
But what I'm saying is, let's swap for it.
I have a toe ring that would look so cute on you!
We're not allowed to wear open-toed shoes, but um maybe I could take that bracelet?
Yes!
Um, I actually got this in a swap with Sienna Miller.
And by that I mean it fell off her wrist at a Halloween party, and I kept it.
Well, maybe I could come over on my lunch break, and we can swap some more stuff!
- Yes, Twy!
-  I mean, I actually thought this would be like, a one-for-one situation, but if you want to open it up - Let me help you with that.
- Oh, that's okay, I got it.
No, the necklace.
Oh, right now?
Okay    - What are you doing?
- Uh word on the street is that you're in a little hot water with Moira, huh?
No, everything's fine with Moira.
I just thought she was coming in today.
Look Johnny, everybody likes to take trips down memory lane, but you gotta get rid of the evidence.
Do you know what a burnt under-wire smells like?
Okay, Roland, I actually don't know what you're talking about.
Those spicy letters from Miss Butterfly that you left out for Moira to find.
How do you know about those letters?
Well, Moira's out showing 'em around town.
Jocelyn's read 'em.
She told me about some very racy parts, young man.
Moira is showing my letters?
Yeah, I was talking to Bob about it.
Why were you talking to Bob about it?
!
We're trying to save your marriage, bud!
Although, Gwen thinks it's probably a lost cause.
She's thinks you might be a sexaholic.
Okay, first of all, everyone should mind their own business, and stay out of my affairs.
Affairs, plural?
Oh.
There's no affair, okay?
Now, would you unlock the door, and open the blind?
Jeez, Johnny, I'm on your side, pal.
Unless things get messy, in that case, I'm gonna be on Moira's side.
So I guess it was sort of like a a low end poly-blend hooded sweatshirt, in what I could only describe as an aubergine color.
And just in case he changes his outfit, do you have a rough idea of his physical description?
Right, um Well, I guess, my build.
- That's being generous.
- If I was at my goal weight.
Officer, they mentioned there was a weapon involved.
Can you describe the weapon?
You describe it.
Well, if there was a weapon, it was concealed.
Yeah, so you know, it's it's sort of hard to describe a concealed weapon.
Yeah, I mean, if we could tell you what it looked like, he wouldn't be doing a good job of concealing it.
Yeah!
So let me get this straight.
You have no idea what it looks like, or whether there was one in the first place.
You guys said you were held up!
Emotionally!
I mean, I don't know if there was a gun, but it was still a robbery, he was wearing a mask.
And would we all not agree that words are weapons?
!
Okay, so you offered the wine, and you offered the cheese and the tapenade, and there was no gun?
This guy just sounds like a lucky customer, David!
- You know what?
I am just gonna -  file this report, and you can follow up if you have any more information.
Yes    So you upsold the robber.
I did not!
I didn't even tell him about the vintage wines we have in the back.
Oh.
Stevie: Speaking of I think we should probably open one of those bottles, just to calm the nerves.
Yeah, I thought you had to go to work.
Great.
Great stuff, you guys.
- Can I have some more popcorn?
- Oh, sure.
Oh, don't worry, I'll get it.
I uh, see you're wearing the locket.
Oh!
I don't know, am I?
Oh, right.
Well, you proved me wrong, Alexis.
And I have to say, I'm actually kind of relieved, because that means that you also kept favourite photo of the two of us.
I keep that photo in a locked folder on my phone.
No, no, I'm talking about the one in the locket.
Hmm!
Now, this appears to be a photo of Twyla?
Yes I put that there.
Because Twyla is an important friend.
And Twyla's mom?
Is her important friend.
You gave the locket to Twyla, didn't you?
Okay, I would've kept it.
But the necklace just kept reminding me of all the bad things that I'd done, and then Twyla gave me a Christmas gift, and I didn't have anything to give her Okay, Alexis, I think we should just agree to stop feeling bad about our past, and just focus on the future.
Yes, Ted.
And, in that spirit, I should probably tell you that I didn't actually keep everything that you gave me.
That's fine.
Yeah, after the breakup, I uh well, I took some of your stuff to the incinerator, along with some pets that needed to be cremated.
- Ew.
- And you think you feel bad?
The wallet that you gave me was still in there, and I had forgotten to take some of the cards out, and I was actually only one stamp away from a free sub, so.
Okay well, if it makes you feel any better, that was David's wallet.
Well, well, "John-John" returns.
Okay, Moira, don't tell me you still haven't slept.
What would give you that impression?
Sweetheart, you've got to find a way of getting some sleep!
Easier said than done, John, when your only husband is longing for his epistle-writing inamorata.
You know what, if you had taken a nap, and cleared your head, instead of running around town showcasing our personal business When we were herded from our home, and forced to grab what few precious items we could, you chose to grab those letters!
- That's right.
- Who is this woman?
!
Oh okay.
If you must know, she's someone who's very important to me.
Oh?
Moira, you wrote those letters!
Don't be absurd, that is not my writing!
It was that week on "Sunrise Bay" when Vivian Blake had her accident, you were in a body cast, they wouldn't let you take it off.
You were writing with your left hand!
The spelunking incident.
No.
It was after she got thrown upwards through a skylight.
-  - Look "I'm lying here in bed, I can't move, I miss you".
It's all there, Moira.
You're telling me none of this rings a bell?
In my defense, John, I had asked for actual painkillers, to help ease me into my character's plight.
But why are you reading them now?
I was missing you, so I took out the letters, because reading them made me feel like you were still here with me.
Oh, you're too sweet.
Unfortunately, we're going to have to stick with my version of the events.
What?
Why would we do that?
I don't want anyone thinking I wrote these!
Well, I don't want people thinking I'm reading some other woman's love letters!
Well, it'll give you an edge.
No one will ever accuse you of being vanilla again.
Who's saying that?
No kids, I understand that you both have read a somewhat adult-themed correspondence between a loving wife and her husband?
Yeah, and I'd prefer if you could stop talking about it.
This is why I think it's best to torch everything from past failed relationships.
I'd hardly call this a failed relationship, David.
We're still here, 35 years later.
Okay, here we go.
I know you asked for a small, but I "swapped it" for a large.
Twyla, may I say, you are looking very chic.
Johnny: Would you look at that?
That looks like the tiara you wore at your bat mitzvah, Alexis.
Well, I had a little help from a friend.
We should probably coordinate a time to swap everything back.
Oh, don't worry, I'm fine.
And what exactly did you get out of this fun swap?
I got Twyla's step-brother's dog tags.
And a whistle.
Moira: Caw!
Caw!
Oh!
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's just sleeping.
Well, I'm ready to order.
Okay, can somebody close her eyelids, at least?
- Please?
-
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 Alexis: First of all, welcome to my office.
Now I think we all know that most VIP guests wouldn't be caught dead at a motel like this, no offense.
But I have been able to secure a V-VIP guest.
Well, I'd go out on a limb and say all of our guests are very important, Alexis.
That's cute.
Anyway, Emir Kaplan is a very influential travel blogger, so it is of the utmost importance that we all make him feel at home.
Hmm.
Well, if he's looking for that homey feeling, I should just invite him over for dinner.
Joce is making pot roast.
All he'd have to bring is a couple of sides, a bottle of wine, and something nice for the house.
Nothing cheap.
- "The Road Less Traveled"?
- It's a very famous blog.
He writes all about the best eats, stays, and attractions off the beaten path.
- Well, I don't want to second - guess your publicity skills here Alexis, but I don't think it would hurt to tilt the scales in our favour.
When we wanted to impress people at Rose Video,  Okay.
Coffee break.
We'd sometimes hire actors who would come in as plants, - pretending to be - Customers!
Yes!
Walk around, talk up whatever they're paid to talk up.
I know, I was once paid to talk up Heartblaster Energy Drink at a Third Eye Blind concert.
I'm pretty sure we don't have the budget for actors.
I mean, if you're looking to pay some guy to lie about how great this motel is, I'm happy to step in.
- Do we need Roland?
- Stevie!
You can be the plant.
You look like someone who just wandered in off the road.
Thanks.
And Johnny can be our Manager.
Okay, first of all, you've gotta stop with the Johnny business, okay?
And secondly, I am the Manager.
Okay, well, you should probably start getting into character, then.
Okay, thanks.
Ray: Knock, knock, everybody decent?
- Oh my God!
- Once again, Ray, saying "knock knock" is not the same thing as actually knocking.
I'm just making breakfast, and I wanted to know if I should make extra for you two.
- No, I think we're good.
- Yes Great!
Door open, or closed?
Closed.
Okay, I thought you were gonna talk to him about this.
I let very few people see me before 9:00 AM.
I did.
The "knock knock" is him taking the note.
Well, you might want to invest in a "lock lock" then.
Mm.
- Knock knock!
- Holy !
I realized I don't have eggs, but I do have pancake mix.
How do we feel about that?
Four, please.
David, you're constantly talking about how much you eat.
But I've seen you walk from the bedroom to the shower, and you look fine.
Huh?
Okay Ray, we we might need a minute.
Of course.
Door open, or closed?
Closed.
Wow!
Okay, this is not working anymore.
I think it's time we look for an apartment.
Oh.
Okay, I mean if that's what you want.
Well, I think it's more of a need at this point, David.
I've been thinking about it for a while.
Oh.
Ray: Gentlemen, you're gonna laugh, but I just remembered, we do have eggs.
They're in the pantry, next to the pancake mix, which means they've been sitting out for days.
Are we feeling lucky?
Can I still have the pancakes?
Yes!
- Ray!
- Patrick?
Door closed.
Of course.
And Zeljko says, you eat, you expire pleasured.
You expire pleasured.
Twyla: Okay.
What are we talking about today?
More Bosnia stories?
Yep, she never seems to run out of 'em.
Twyla, do you think it might be too much of an imposition to ask the chef to whip me up a kifla?
- What's a kifla?
- Oh, how best to describe it.
I don't think you need to.
Hi, y'all!
Oh, Ronnie, Moira, I see you've ordered without me, makes sense, because I was seven minutes late!
Well, we've yet to put in our kifla order, if you're peckish.
Oh, I can't stay.
I actually might not be able to make it to rehearsal today.
Roland was supposed to watch the baby, but he's got tied up at the motel, so Oh Jocelyn, if you can't make it rehearsal, no one's gonna hold that against you.
Yeah, the baby comes first.
Well, I just feel bad because we really need to rehearse that Nine Inch Nails medley for our concert at "Yarn for Cheap".
I'd be more than happy to spearhead that effort, Jocelyn.
After collaborating so closely with the director on "Crows," I feel even more finely attuned to the fluctuations of the human condition.
Okay, it's just, I thought that was sort of my Even if you miss a performance Jocelyn, there will be others!
And don't worry about your solo, Jocelyn.
I know it by heart.
I actually sing it quietly every time you do it.
I know, Twyla.
And it's not that quiet.
Anyways, I guess I get to sit this one out.
Aw, it looks like somebody's up.
No rest for the wicked.
Well, these days, either he's crying, or I am.
Okay See you l-l-later.
- Bye!
- Bye!
I'll get the door!
I'm-I'm sorry, excuse me.
Okay.
Johnny: Welcome to the Rosebud Motel, Mr. Kaplan.
Johnny Rose, and it's a pleasure to uh Johnny is our Manager, so just let me know if you need anything from him.
And this is Roland, he is our Guest Services Liaison.
Yes, and it's actually pronounced "lee-as-on".
And my name is actually pronounced "Ro-lahnd".
And if there's anything you need, please tell me.
Room service, turn-down service, valet service Okay Ro lahnd, those are a few items that might be tricky to pull off, but we do have coffee and pastries every morning.
Oh, great, that uh, that should beat the black mold I had for breakfast at my last motel.
Ro-lahnd, why don't you show Mr. Kaplan to his room?
Oh yes, formidab-Le.
If you would uh, how do you say, um, voulez-vous with me please.
I'll show you to your room.
Right this way, we have you in our most deluxe suite.
Suite number four is uh Ah!
Miss Felming ton.
Enjoying your stay?
Yes.
Okay, Ro-lahnd, Johnny, we should let our guests continue chatting.
Ro-lahnd, this way.
Here you go.
Thank you.
I think you're really gonna like it here.
It's clean, and the service is good.
Yeah.
Anyway, I'm just staying here as a guest.
It's always good to know who your neighbours are in a place like this, you know, it's kind of a roll of the dice, but uh you seem somewhat normal.
- Thank you for saying that.
- Well.
Everyone agreed that I was the normal one in my cell-block at the women's prison, so.
Oh, wow.
Which prison?
Maybe you know my wife.
I don't-I'm kidding.
I don't have a wife - anymore.
- Oh, disappeared?
I'll never stop looking.
I'm Emir.
- Stevie.
- Stevie, hi.
Stevie, nice to meet you.
Oh, David.
We have a V-VIP staying with us at the moment.
So do you mind staying at Patrick's tonight?
Your vibe can be a bit intense.
Um, excuse me?
If anything, I'm a selling point.
And Patrick's is a no-go.
If fact, he just texted me the address of a new apartment that we might be going to see together later, so.
Um, did I leave a Q-tip in, or did you just tell me that you guys are getting an apartment together?
Hey, we're just going to look.
Yeah, and Adam Levine and I just went for bubble tea.
I'm feeling very apprehensive about the whole thing, like, I never saw myself living with someone.
That makes total sense, considering how nobody you dated ever expressed any interest in that.
I'm pretty sure I can think of someone.
By the end of the day, so.
David, I think this could be good for you guys.
And also I know you're thinking like, Alexis is becoming a major girl boss, and is she just saying this so she can expand her home office when I move out?
I actually wasn't thinking that at all.
Anyway, David, your boyfriend asked you to move in with him.
You do it.
I know.
Also, do you have like, a time-frame as to when that might happen?
No, I don't.
Jazzagals: Yes!
Yeah!
Oh my God, so moody.
Love it!
Now, Ronnie?
The line has been changed to, "I want to kiss you like an animal".
I'll remember it on the day.
I say we wrap things up on a high.
Ladies, scour your closets for black leather.
Pleather accepted.
I'm here!
I've got a sitter!
Oh Jocelyn, I'm afraid that dirigible has ascended.
But I'm here on time.
Yes you are, but we started an hour early.
Ronnie has a massage.
You moved the rehearsal for Ronnie's massage?
Well, it was also conducive to Twyla's schedule.
It's hard for her to juggle, what with the cafe.
Oh, is it hard for her?
To juggle?
And none of you here thought to tell me about this little time change?
You said you couldn't make it because of the bebe.
We could start rehearsal over.
Ohhh no!
Don't make any changes on my account, I mean, you've gotta get to the cafe, and Ronnie's gotta have a massage!
I have sciatica.
I ran all over town looking for a babysitter!
Oh Pulled a number off a telephone pole.
She's a pet sitter, but she said she'd make an exception.
I don't even know her last name!
Jocelyn, that sounds dangersome.
I didn't wanna miss this rehearsal!
But do any of you care?
Apparently not!
Because all of you have been acting like bunch of b-words!
Okay.
Evidently, one or two of you have gotten under her skin.
I'll handle it.
-  - Hey, Johnny?
Our VIP is still in his room, so we should probably hold off on the turn-down service.
What turn-down service?
Oh, that's just a little something I've initiated now that I'm Guest Services Manager.
I thought you were a liaison.
No, I gave myself a promotion.
Hey Stevie, what's the intel?
Uh well, I had a nap, then a beer, and now I need $40.
What are you doing, buying a wedding dress?
Uh, Emir would like me to go to lunch with him.
What?
No!
- You don't have to do that!
- Oh, jeez.
It's fine, it's just lunch.
No Stevie, this is going way too far.
Um, what's going on?
Oh, Johnny's forcing Stevie into a very uncomfortable situation with a strange man.
Ugh.
Okay fine, I'll tap in.
Who are we talking about?
Emir, and I'm fine to go.
Stevie, I would go in your place, it's just, my afternoon is gonna be kinda crazy - with all the turndowns.
- No, I want to go!
So can I just have the $50?
I thought it was $40.
I also need shampoo.
Body lice, you know, from the sheets, that'll get you a bad review.
I've-I've contracted it a few times, it's not pretty.
Wow, what I love about this conversation is how well it goes with lunch.
Yeah, okay, this is not my A-material.
But then again, I don't normally ask women out when I'm on the job.
Okay, you're telling me that you review motels for a living, and you've never met anyone?
Okay, this may shock you, but uh a lot of the people that you meet in motels are not exactly like Not like what?
Well, they're not like you.
Oh, yeah.
Smart, charming, dazzling sense of humor, I was gonna say modest, but  So what brings you to town?
Uh, just driving to meet my sister in Florida.
Anyway, what about you?
- Do you like what you do?
- I do, for the most part.
You know, I like to keep a low profile when I'm on the road.
I find if people know that I'm coming in advance, they tend to put on a big show, and I never know what's genuine, so.
Yeah, that must be tough.
Okay, I don't even know where to start with this menu.
I'm a plant.
I'm sorry?
You were talking about never knowing what's genuine, and uh I can't keep this up.
I work at the motel, and my coworkers thought it would be a good idea for me to like, talk up the motel.
Uh, but the more we talked, the worse I felt.
So you cracked before we even ordered drinks?
Yeah.
It turns out I'm really bad at this.
- Ah.
-  Anyway, I'll leave you to lunch.
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, hang hang on a second.
Okay, look, the problem is, I eat most of my meals by myself.
So when there's a beautiful woman sitting across from me, even if she is a con artist, I welcome the company.
Please.
Okay.
Moira: Gals, let's welcome our dear friend Jocelyn back into the circle.
Oh, should we be in a circle?
It's not top secret, we all know Jocelyn has trouble being honest.
Do we all know that?
Wrong word, okay.
Authentic.
I think I can take it from here, Moira.
All right, then.
Gals, since the baby, things have just been really tough.
That's good, that's good, expand on that.
Okay, and I feel like sometimes that my voice isn't being heard in this group.
Touch louder, Jocelyn.
Just because I don't ask for your help, doesn't mean that I don't need it!
Just a little more specific, we're all here to help you.
Okay, okay, well, Ronnie.
I know that you've been getting a lot of massages lately, because they're supposed to help with your bad back, and stabilize your mood, but I haven't noticed an improvement!
And sometimes you sing too softly.
Agree to disagree.
- And Twyla - I'm sorry, I'll sing louder.
Nope, you are singing too loud.
Wonderful, let it out, Jocelyn.
And Moira.
Okay, we can stop it there for today.
We are all sick and tired of hearing about Bosnia.
- Yep.
- It's Bosnia this, and "Crows" that, and Blajka We're just grasping at straws now, Jocelyn.
But this has been a fruitful exercise, don't we all feel better?
Look at Twyla, look how moved she is.
Oh no, I'm fine.
I've actually seen a few photos of this place, it looks pretty good.
Yeah, the facade would indicate otherwise, - but I trust you on this.
- Oh.
You know, when I moved here and got a room with Ray, I didn't know how long I was gonna be staying.
- Mhmm - And now here we are.
For me this is bittersweet because on the one hand, I could lose you as a roommate, Patrick, but on the other, I would gain the commission.
As you can see, this is open concept.
Oh wow.
It's good, eh, David?
I thought this was the penthouse.
Uh, it is the top floor of three floors.
- You said this was a one - bedroom.
It is, in the sense that it's a one - bed - room.
Any more beds, and you'd be in trouble.
- Although bunk beds can be fun.
- Fireplace?
Yeah, which I'm sure would heat the room quite quickly, considering it's just one big open space.
I like the exposed brick.
It's actually a pretty decent size.
Yeah.
Speaking of size, Ray, I've yet to see a closet.
Is there a is there a walk-in that I'm missing?
Oh, the closet is right over here.
This is what small-space realtors refer to as, a "step-in" closet.
What do you think, David?
- It's pretty perfect, huh?
- Yeah, it's pretty.
Y-yeah.
Not to jeopardize our review any further, but would you mind not blowing my cover?
Don't worry, I got it.
Look who's back in da house!
Johnny: Safe and sound, Ms. Felmington.
Feeling okay about everything?
That's a weird thing to say, but yes, I am.
I turned down your bed for you, but I didn't have any chocolates, so I left a doggie bag of pot roast on your pillow.
Oh.
Well, that's uh unnecessarily generous of you, Ro-lahnd.
You know, I did have a couple of requests, actually.
Yes, of course.
I was wondering if Ro-lahnd could make a reservation at the cafe tonight for Ms. Felmington and I?
Uh hm!
- Do we have sign - off from Ms. Felmington?
- We do.
- Emir: Great.
One more thing, you mentioned room service, I would love an English breakfast tea to the room, and maybe one for Ms. Felmington.
Oh, absolutely.
Johnny, Emir would like some tea, and so would Ms. Felmington.
Yes, and I'll show you where you can find that Ro-lahnd.
Mrs. Felmington, may I speak with you for a minute?
I'm really tired, can this wait?
Mhmm.
Thanks.
Hm.
So, dinner tonight?
Yeah, yeah, if it's all right with you, I-I wouldn't mind getting to know the real Ms. Felmington a little more.
It is all right with me.
Although it is a little unethical, just between you and I, so why don't I go write this review, and then I won't have to feel guilty later?
- Okay.
- Okay?
All right.
- After you.
- Oh!
Oh!
That's not my room.
Right, yeah, sorry.
I didn't mean to.
I mean, I know it's like the first place that we've looked at, but there's just something very homey about it to me.
Yeah, a sentiment shared by inmates, after their first couple years in jail.
Okay, so you hate it.
No.
No.
No, it's just if I've learned anything from "House Hunters", you always to see the loft space, the charming English cottage, and the renovated craftsman that you don't really wanna take, but the producers are gonna force you to see anyway, before you make any major decisions.
Gentlemen, I have one more thing to show you.
How are we still on this  tour?
!
- Just - You'll thank me later, but uh, no more worrying about door open, door closed.
All you have to do is open the curtain -  - to the bathroom!
Ray, can we just have a moment?
Absolutely.
I'll just wait in the bathroom.
Curtain open, or curtain closed?
- Oh, closed!
- Closed, I think.
Mhmm.
Don't worry, we'll be putting a door on there.
But I don't know if I wanna put a door on the bathroom!
I don't know if I love this place.
And I'm not just saying that because the lack of closet space will inevitably force us to break up, I just sorta feel like if we're going to be moving in together, we should both be totally on board.
I totally understand, David.
Good.
It's just that I was looking at this place like just for me.
Oh.
Okay, it's just that you had said that we were going to see p-places.
Right, yeah, so like, more of a general "we".
Because I knew that you'd be staying over here quite a bit, and that you'd probably have an opinion about it.
Sure.
Well then, you know, in that case, if this just for you, and occasionally me,  I think it's cute.
Wait, does this mean that you were ready to move in with me?
- No.
- No?
Hmm.
No, it's a closet space, and a timing thing.
- Uh - huh.
Yeah.
So you know, maybe we can negotiate down the line - at some point.
- Hmm.
Ray: I can barely hear your conversation.
Are we sure we want the door?
- Are you sure?
- Up to you.
There's a little piece of press you might wanna read.
Oh, if I've died again, I swear to God!
- We are a "must-stay".
- What?
!
"The Rosebud Motel is a must-stay for any road-tripper, or weary traveler.
This charming, lovingly restored, roadside motel is a welcome pit-stop for anyone looking for a clean room, and first-rate hospitality".
Compared to what, a haunted house?
"In fact, Johnny Rose and his Guest Services manager, will go almost too far out of their way to ensure a pleasant stay".
How do I sign up for this turn-down service?
Is there a clipboard, or something?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1   Johnny: Moira!
The water's ice cold!
How long were you in here?
!
John, you know my ritual!
Five to ten minutes to let the water warm, there's the initial scrub, followed by the deep conditioner, which must set for 20 minutes, and finally, the double rinse cycle.
Well, we can't be doing that anymore, sweetheart!
Our water bill is going through the roof!
Yes, painfully aware of our budgetary constraints, John.
I'm currently reading a magazine from July, 1987.
Where do you even find these?
Alexis: So I just signed for this, so does that mean I get to keep it?
- Also, what is it?
- Oh my God, it's here.
- Give it some room, Alexis!
- Give what some room?
What exactly are you getting shipped from "Harrod's of London"?
Family, I'd like to you to meet a dear friend whom I've yet to meet.
Give a warm dobrodosli to my red carpet gown for the "Crows" premiere.
Moira, you didn't tell me they'd set a date - for the premiere!
- Yes!
I've been told definitively it will happen, and I quote, "ideally sometime this year".
Okay, there must be some mistake here.
This is valued at $3,700.
What?
!
$3,700?
What designer gave you that kind of discount?
Sadly, it's not custom this time around, Alexis.
Mommy had to shop off the rack.
Fortunately, I discovered something called - a "promo code".
- This is a reduced price?
Yes.
Discount couture, do you believe it?
I'm surprised she made it through customs.
I once passed off a mini horse and three Guinea pigs as service animals, so anything is possible.
Perfect a spot of tea for the unveiling.
I was actually just boiling water for my bath.
Does this mean I should start thinking about my look for the premiere?
TBD on the guest list, Alexis, but I love your enthusiasm.
Box?
Box.
David: I'm so glad we're doing this.
We never get to spend quality time together.
Also, I've been neglecting my wellness journey, so the cherry blossoms opening when we both have time off is really ticking a lot of boxes for me.
Are you sure the cherry blossoms are even open now?
I mean, I thought that wasn't for another couple weeks.
Mm, no, no, I called the botanical gardens, and had the girl send me a photo.
I learned the hard way from my last trip to Japan.
Showed up, no cherry blossoms, turned right back around, it was such a waste.
Wow, that's a lot of pressure to put on cherry blossoms.
Well, why else would we be driving to Elm Valley?
Ooh!
Why else would we be driving to Elm Valley, Stevie?
The only other reason I can think of is that Emir might be there.
The hotel reviewer that You had the dirty motel sex with?
Well, when you put it that way it sorta cheapens it, but yes, he might also be there, reviewing a hotel.
But not the hotel that we're going to, because that would be a crazy coincidence.
Sorry, I knew you wouldn't come if you thought you were gonna be a third wheel.
Okay well, sucks for him, because I only booked the private garden tour for two people.
- Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
- Please don't.
I don't think we're gonna go - No!
- To the botanical gardens.
Wow!
So this is an abduction, then.
I am a single woman driving way out of town to meet a guy I don't know very well!
Well Once he shows up I'm sure you can still go to the botanical gardens!
I'm not going to the botanical gardens by myself!
What, am I gonna walk around, and admire the cherry blossoms alone, like some pervert?
!
So if you're gonna meet this guy there, there where am I staying?
I don't do couches!
I got you a separate room.
A separate room, okay.
So this has all been premeditated, then.
You know what, I hope for your sake, that they have cherry blossoms in prison.
Hey Shannon, what's up?
Ted's in his office, you can just let yourself in.
Yikes.
Okay, thank you.
Hey, I know you're really swamped today, so I brought you this.
- You can thank me later.
- Oh!
That's decaf, right?
No, that detail actually slipped my mind, so maybe I'll just take it.
Oh, almost a sweet gesture, Alexis, thank you.
You know who's not sweet?
Old Shan out there.
Okay, first of all Alexis, she's not old, we went to vet school together.
And she's actually been really helpful this week.
To you.
I'm just gonna say it, Ted.
Most people are a fan.
So when someone's not, it's usually on them.
All right, fine, I, I didn't wanna bring this up, because it is so not a thing.
But well, when you and I were broken up, there was one night where Shannon and I  Oh my God!
Ted!
We hooked up.
Yes you did, you little smooch monster!
Well, we did a lot more than that.
I'm sorry, should I be jealous?
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
It was just a one-time thing.
- Oh, no.
- No, not "oh no," No, I stopped it from going any further.
Because I thought we were just better off as friends.
Beep, beep!
Paging Dr. Casanova J. Heartbreaker.
Anyway, that's probably why she seems like she's a little unsure about where she stands with you.
Well, thank you for telling me that, Ted.
That makes so much more sense than her not liking me.
Well, I'm glad that we could clear that up.
Okay, well, I will see you for lunch then, "Doctor".
Yeah, it's funny because I actually am a doctor.
So am I No, you're not.
Just-just Ted.
Roland: Hey, Johnny!
Johnny!
I have some good news for you, my friend.
Well, I could use some good news, I might have to take out a mortgage on the dress - my wife just bought.
- Well, uh you know that little hot water problem you're having?
Yeah?
Well, I've come up with the perfect excuse for you to buy yourself a brand new hot water heater!
Still waiting for the good news.
Well, the good news is that my friend Terry can replace the whole thing for you.
- Replace it?
- Mhmm.
Well, how much is that gonna cost?
I did a little negotiating with Terry, and he says you can have it for $4,200.
- $4200?
!
- Right.
Unless you want it installed.
Well, of course I want it installed, Roland!
Okay, well, that's gonna be $5,500.
Okay, you know what?
I can't afford to throw away money like that.
Oh, come on, this coming from the guy who was just bragging about taking out a mortgage to pay for his wife's dress!
- I wasn't bragging!
- Ohhh Moira: Well, hello!
Is it just me, or is there a faint scent of honeysuckle in the air?
Yeah, it might be Johnny's aftershave.
I'm-I'm sorry, it is pungent.
And John, I tried to hang up my gown, and thank God I caught it before that silly curtain rod came crashing down!
Don't worry about it, we'll get you a new one.
As soon we get uh, "El Tightwad" here to loosen up the purse strings.
John, give this man a raise!
And when dear, did our room become so moist?
I'm off to get a dehumidifier, but I will see you at lunch.
Oh, is that him?
- No.
- Okay.
- What about the person - David, I would tell you if I saw him!
Also, that's rude!
Okay, it's just that your type is very inconsistent.
What time was he supposed to show up, anyway?
Two hours ago.
And we're sure this is the right hotel?
He's not coming.
I'm an idiot.
Well, I guess the good thing to come out of this abduction is that if anyone knows how to crawl out from under an embarrassing romantic failure, it's me.
So I say we drop our bags, go straight to the botanical gardens, take in some cherry blossoms, then sleep it off, and go home fresh tomorrow.
What time was the tour again?
Oh, David, I'm so sorry.
If this wasn't so humiliating for you, I think I'd be in a darker headspace right now, but since it is the hotel bar has karaoke, I say we get several rounds of polar bear shots, load up some Mariah, and I will spend the rest of the night pretending not to resent you.
Okay.
I'll get the first round.
Oh, you'll be getting every round.
Alexis: Oh my God, Shan!
You still here?
Have you not taken lunch?
I've just been pretty busy.
Ugh, same.
Can I get a "hell yeah" for two hard-working women in the 21st Century?
Anyway, I think that we both know that things are a bit off between us, and I understand why.
Ted told me all about your little Mmm!
Muah!
Muah!
And it's like not a big deal.
Okay.
Alexis, that's-that's such a relief.
And oh!
Honestly, between us, it was just a drunken one-time thing, and I told him we'd be better off as friends.
Oh.
Did you tell him that after he told you that?
Sorry?
Ted: Alexis.
Right on time.
You're telling me, I was just having a chat with Shan.
Clearing the air about that little trip you two took to pound town.
- Alexis!
- Whoa!
Okay, let's remember this is still a place of work.
Look, I don't know about you, Shannon, but I am so glad we did this.
Had I not talked to her, I never would've found out that she called it off.
- Maybe I will go for lunch.
- Well, just, um, one minute.
Again, not that it matters, you know, but uh, the day after we um, we were supposed to meet up at the 5k for Feral Cats, and I never followed up so.
- Oh!
Yeah, it totally doesn't matter.
- No.
But I also never followed up.
So when we saw each other the next weekend at the opening of Bronwyn's Exotic Animal Clinic, I assumed you'd gotten the hint.
Okay, well, that's what I assumed, so Okay, not to interject, but I assumed that this would play out in a much more interesting way.
So for the sake of time, um, I'm just gonna go with Shannon's version of things.
Shannon, can we get you anything while we're out?
Uh, I'm not sure that we actually quite finished - the conversation.
- Oh, it's okay, Ted.
Because the important thing is, that Shannon and I had a breakthrough.
Yeah, but I'm just not really sure where we landed on - Mhmm, yeah.
- On the whole Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Okay.
When it comes to water heater repairs, you don't need electrical experience to check, or replace the heating elements.
Great.
The only thing you need to do is make sure the power is off before you perform any tests Okay, where's the power switch?
I need the power switch, okay, hold on, hold on.
- Find the circuit breaker - Power?
I can't get to the circuit breaker until-hold on!
Slow slow-hold on!
- Hold-st-stop!
-  Rewind!
How do you rewind?
!
Where's the manual?
!
Oh Johnny, there you are!
I've been looking all over for you.
Urgent question.
Um what's our policy on smoke breaks?
- Who's taking a smoke break?
- I am.
- You don't smoke.
- Yeah, I know.
And I don't think I should be penalized for that.
Roland, I'm kinda busy right now with the water heater.
Johnny, I don't think kicking that thing is really gonna help.
LOL.
Okay, I'm trying to follow the video here, it says it's for beginners.
Yeah well, I think you got the right video there.
But don't you think something like that should be handled by professionals, Johnny?
Like, maybe Terry?
Roland, you know something?
There's a lot going on with the family right now, and if there's an economical way for me to deal with this, without pumping more money into it, then that's what I'm gonna do!
Johnny, let me tell you something.
That is not the place to cut corners.
Okay?
What you need to do is re-examine your extravagant lifestyle.
What are you talking about?
Well, not all of us can drive around in an 8 cylinder car.
It's a '78 Lincoln, and it's all we could afford!
- Right, '78.
Vintage.
- Okay!
Roland, do you mind if I get back to work?
!
Yeah, no problem, I've got to go on my smoke break.
As time goes on   Wow, for someone who can barely stand, she sounds good.
How are we feeling?
All things considered, I'm feeling better.
Good.
I'm gonna see if they have more Mariah, the first three songs were just a warm-up.
Oh.
Hi.
I'm so sorry.
A student driver rear-ended me on the way over here, it was a whole thing.
He started crying.
We had to exchange insurance information.
His mom was there.
You couldn'tve called?
I thought I was stood up.
The student driver has my phone, and I have his.
We didn't give them back to each other after we exchanged info.
So if you wanna know what's on a 16 year old's smartphone, I could offer you that.
No, thank you.
Yeah, that's probably for the best.
Okay, good news, they have "Fantasy," which means that you get to play Ol' Dirty Bastard.
Oh, are-are you here with someone?
- Uh, no.
- Oh!
Ohhh Oh um, no.
We just ran into each other at the bar.
Um, long story short, I took a pottery class with this one.
Oh, uh, I'm Emir.
- Oh, Dane a. Dana.
- Dana?
Yeah, so I run-I run the karaoke at the hotel.
- Hmm.
- Yeah.
Uh, Stevie, I know I'm two hours late, but can I still take you to dinner, or have I blown it?
Oh, you've blown it.
But I'll still take a free dinner.
- I can work with that, okay.
- Okay.
- Mhmm.
- Okay!
Um, I'm just gonna settle up my tab, - I'll meet you outside.
- Okay, yeah.
Uh, nice to meet you, Dana.
Yes, thanks.
Why don't you just come with us?
I already made you miss the botanical gardens.
I can't leave you here.
Okay, honestly, I'm gonna be really exhausted after my set anyways, so I'll probably just go to bed.
Are you sure?
No, so get outta here before I change my mind.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Unnecessary, but Keep the mics hot, I'm comin' in!
Moira?
We need to talk, sweetheart.
I'm sorry dear, is your mouth moving?
Could you uh, turn off the dehumidifier for a second?
Because I can't possibly hear you over the sound of the dehumidifier!
Oh, just-just turn off  So, it looks like in addition to the water heater, we're gonna have to replace some of the plumbing.
And the water is so hard, that Terry said that it's likely in the next little while we might also need a new water softener.
John, I'm sorry you've had such a hard day.
- Yeah - On the upside, this gown has exceeded all expectations.
Yeah, well that's good, sweetheart, that's that's good.
It's just that um, you know, with all these costs piling up, we might need to take a hard look at uh, some of our recent uh purchases.
I told Alexis now is not the time to expand that home office.
Not with the price of ink today.
Yeah Moira, look.
The last thing I want to do is uh rain on your parade, but I think for the next little while, any money coming in should probably be for the family.
This dress is for the family.
To remind us that our futures lie outside this town.
It feels these days like I'm the only one who hasn't veered off course.
Well, no one's veering off course, Moira, we're all just uh taking a different approach.
The ceremonial purchase of the gown has always been my good luck charm.
Well, from everything you've told us about this movie, Moira, it sounds like for the first time in a long time, you may not need any luck.
Oh, John!
Thank you for that.
And know that you've been heard!
Good.
Ted: You know, Alexis, I've been thinking about it, and I'm really glad that you and Shannon were able to get everything out in the open.
Me too.
We're actually grabbing drinks tomorrow.
Great, yeah, you know, and I-I I care way more about that than any of the details of how we ended things, or even whether they were accurate.
It seems like it was just like a little miscommunication on your part, is all.
Yeah well, uh, Shannon aside, I think it's important that I tell you that there were a few others before Heather.
And there may have been a couple of broken hearts along the way.
Whatever you say, Ted.
Yeah it's actually kinda funny, because I was just going through my phone, you know, to make some space, and then I came across this little back and forth from a while ago.
I believe you, Ted.
You're still Dr. Casanova to me.
Okay, well, the tone of your voice makes it seem like you don't believe a word you're saying.
Okay, Ted!
"Dear Melanie".
Melanie?
Is this the girl from the falafel place?
Yeah, I don't think that's relevant.
Ahem.
"I've had a lot of fun hanging out with you, and I really fal-awful saying this over text, but I'm just not feeling strongly enough to take this to the next level.
I'm sorry".
Pretty harsh.
But it had to be done.
And then um, she wrote - Oh, it doesn't matter what she wrote.
- "Cool"!
Exclamation mark.
And it looks like you ended up walking her dog for her?
Well, she seemed really upset.
Listen Ted, I've gone through enough heartbreakers for like, two people's lifetimes.
And I don't want that anymore.
I want you.
And that cute lil' butt.
David and Tammy: Ohhhh Oh!
Oh!
Yes, Tammy!
Tammy, everybody!
It's Tammy!
Yeah!
Stevie, hi!
Oh - Hi!
- Hi.
So Emir asked me if I wanted to stay the night.
Ohhhh!
That sounds promising.
Yeah.
Um, I thought you were gonna go to bed?
Oh no, I was, but then Tammy kept buying shots, and the whole room got behind me in like, a really big way.
Anyway, I have seven more songs to finish, and some new fans who would be very disappointed if I don't close the show.
- Oh, Dana!
Or is it David?
- Huh?
Listen, I just wanted you to know that Stevie told me what you did for her tonight.
You know, giving up your evening, so that we could have some time together.
Anyway, it was really cool of you to do it, is what I'm saying, and not just because um we get to have a little sleepover because of it.
So to say thank you, I took care of your room charges.
Oh my God!
Hello!
Um, hi!
Can I get another drink then, to the room, please?
Thanks!
I actually just meant like, your mini-bar.
Oh no, I finished that.
Hey, Tam!
You want some zhampagne?
!
Yeah, two please, drinks.
Okay, um what do you say we get up there, maybe do a little duet?
I feel like that's the kind of thing you'd be totally comfortable with, right?
- Mhmm - Yeah, love that.
I think it's best if you guys just sat down, and watched.
- Oh, okay.
- Next time.
- Yeah.
Mhmm.
- Off the hook for now.
Uno, Tammy!
I think I'm going to do this one by myself.
- Oh!
- Thank you so much, though.
- We'll call you back.
- Wow.
See you soon.
I would like to dedicate this one to the lovers right over there!
- Okay - And, goodnight.
David: The la-la-lovers Cue it up!
Okay, are you coming out?
Can you stop yelling, please?
!
I had 14 polar bear shots last night.
Moira, do you want us to close our eyes?
Oh my God.
Moira, it's gorgeous.
Wasn't it shown with a veil?
Oh, the veil's on its way.
Well, now that I see it on you, I understand!
I feel like I'm waiting for the limo to take us to your next red carpet event!
Well, sweetheart, if that's if that's the dress you want, then, uh It is.
But you're right, John, it's not the time.
So before I send her back, take a mental picture.
And perhaps an actual picture as well?
- Anyone have a camera?
- Oh.
- Yes, yes.
- Oh yes.
- Gimme like, a mm!
- Mm!
-  - Like, arm.
- Oh!
- Okay.
- Yeah, got it?
-  Okay, that's it.
And if all goes to plan, we'll meet again on the red carpet.
Ideally, sometime this year.
And those are the shoes we're going with?
- What do you think?
- No.
Shoes, later.
As well as jewels.
-  - What?
!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
David, what time is Patrick's housewarming tonight?
Hmm, you'll have to ask him.
He told me he doesn't want my help, so I'm just gonna play the supportive partner, and watch him fail.
Okay, it's just that if Ted and I are gonna be fashionably late, we need to know when it starts.
Jocelyn: There you are, Alexis!
- Good morning, Roses.
- Jocelyn, Roland.
Look at you, positively flushed with motherly glow.
We've just been running around looking for Alexis.
That's so sweet; what's up?
Remember that time that you told me you'd be there for me if I ever needed you?
I don't think that was me.
Well, our babysitter for tonight just canceled on us, and we were gonna have dinner, and uh, a couples massage.
But unfortunately, the couple that massages us can only do it once a month, so Hmm, no.
Um well, I totally would think about it, but I have a housewarming thing tonight.
Jocelyn and Roland: Ohhh David?
Is Patrick also going to that housewarming party?
Patrick's throwing the party, unfortunately.
Well Rollie, we're just gonna have to cancel.
Because we have asked literally everyone.
Oh, jeez.
Thanks anyways, Roses.
-  - Moira: Sorry.
Well, that was weird.
Seriously.
A nighttime couples massage, what is this, 1985?
!
No!
They asked everyone at the table except us, we're sitting right here!
They're not going to ask someone of your age, John.
We raised two kids.
"Raised" might be a stretch.
Our nursery was in a different wing of the house.
- It was a design flaw.
- I'm a light sleeper.
John, you're not still working on that cumbersome laundry hamper?
I told you, it's a playpen, Moira.
I was hoping you were joking.
No.
After Roland and Jocelyn's little oversight this morning, I took it upon myself to offer our services.
Why in God's name would you do that?
!
It's a principle thing.
Roland and Jocelyn don't think we can take care of a kid.
That's an argument I'm willing to lose.
So now I have go to Ronnie's by myself.
What?
I told you, the Lifetime Network is re-airing the movie I did with Joyce DeWitt.
Remember?
"Not Without My Cousin".
And Ronnie's TV gets that channel, I told you this, John!
Or at least I'm telling you now.
Okay, well then, have fun.
I'm more than capable of looking after this kid myself.
John, my sweet husband.
We have nothing to prove as parents.
We did our best for our children.
Yeah, we were there most weeknights.
For at least a couple of hours.
Unless we were out for the evening.
Yeah, or jetting around.
Or if it was a really long day.
Yeah, no, no, I'm not the least bit concerned, Moira.
Besides, if Roland can look after a baby, anyone can.
Hey, Jocelyn.
- Jocelyn: Hi, Johnny.
- Roland: Hi, Johnny.
Jocelyn: Thank you so much, Johnny, it just would've never occurred to us to ask you.
Are you sure you're up for this?
Oh, he'll be fine, honey, And if he does find himself completely lost, and believe me, he will, he will have the baby binder to hold his hand.
Right here, Johnny.
Okay, well, here goes nothing.
- Yeah.
- I don't know why, I'm just I'm having a hard time letting go.
I've got him.
I've got him, Jocelyn.
- Oh, okay, okay.
- Well, I know why.
It's because you don't trust the guy, and believe me, I don't either, but we're in this now, so try not think about it.
Okay Wow, Moira.
Looking so elegant for a night of babysitting.
Just dressed to the nines in choking hazards.
Sadly, Jocelyn, I won't be here this evening to intercede.
Oh wow, so it's just gonna be Johnny, alone with our precious miracle baby?
Uh honey, come on, we're gonna be late for our massage.
You know Ron and Linda like to do those stretches before they get us on the table, so I'll be thinking about all of you during my massage.
No, no need for that, Roland.
Okay Johnny, just don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Jocelyn: Love you!
- What?
- Whoop!
Whoop!
-  - Boop boop be boop!
Wow.
What are those?
These are party shots.
- Hmm - You ever had one before?
No, nope.
Fine, once.
Twice.
Fine, I had a tray in Cancun.
Okay, well they kinda go with my overall theme of a good old-fashioned high school slumber party, so.
Mhmm, I still don't know why you were so quick to dismiss my theme idea.
Where is anybody gonna find glass-blown Venetian masks around here?
Besides, people are kind of excited about the high school idea.
Okay.
Walk me through the high school idea.
Models and teen actors are just gonna lounge around in their bras and thongs, and take Polaroids of themselves all night?
What was your high school experience like?
What was yours like?
Besides, where are we going to find a salad bowl of E this last minute?
You know, I think this could be kind of a a fun opportunity for you to rewrite your past a little bit.
Mhmm.
It's just that my parents have spent like, an astounding amount of money on therapy to try to do that already.
So forgive me for not wanting to run back into the fire.
What happened to you?
Nothing, really, I just didn't like it.
- Mm.
Okay.
Oh.
- Yeah.
You might have to make more of those.
- That's right.
- That's very nice.
Honey, I'm home.
Oh, shouldn't I be the one saying that?
A little something to celebrate the end of the week.
- Yeah - Whoop!
Uh, except it's Neuterpalooza week at work, and I still have two days of spaying and neutering ahead of me.
Oh, let's stop saying "neutering", 'cause it's killing my buzz!
This is so silky.
Yeah, it's my dad's housecoat from storage.
I was thinking we could go as Hef, R.I.P., and a Playboy Bunny.
Isn't the theme high school slumber party?
It is.
My best friend, Summer, used to date Hef in high school, which isn't as weird as it sounds, 'cause he was like, a very young 77.
Uh okay, don't be mad, but Ted, no!
I have to perform surgery on people's pets like, first thing in the morning.
Why'd you have to pick this weekend?
You know how much I always look forward to Patrick's house parties.
Isn't this his first one?
Okay, fine.
I guess I'll just finish my drink, and wander over there dressed like this, and see what happens.
Well, I mean, maybe you don't need to leave just yet.
Snip, snip, Mr. Mullens!
I was just hoping you could make an exception.
Let loose for one night.
Next time.
I promise.
Moira: Well, I'm off.
All right, have fun, sweetheart.
You realize the bebe is crying.
I do, yes.
Isn't it scheduled to be dormant by now?
I'll figure it out, Moira.
- You have the binder.
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Ooh!
I think I just found the issue.
It might be in the diaper.
Oh, it was the bebe.
I'm so relieved!
Yeah, I think they left extra diapers.
They assumed we'd take care of it.
You wanna grab the rubber gloves?
They're Tom Ford, John, no!
And they wouldn't fit you anyway.
The cleaning gloves under the sink!
Oh!
Yes.
And, there.
Oh, it looks like Jocelyn's left you some nice chapter tabs.
Uh, it's saying here that you should wipe counter-clockwise direction, ah flip it, if you can flip it.
- The baby?
- It doesn't say.
Honestly, Moira, just go!
I'll be fine.
I'm not sure you will be, John.
It's not like the old days when we could just call Adelina, and have her rush home from her daughter's wedding.
You're gonna miss your screening.
I'll go after the first commercial break.
That's when the action happens anyway, when my cousin and I begin our backpack through Lebanon.
What else does the binder say?
Oh my God, John!
Don't forget to wash its hands!
Okay.
Okay, my turn.
Ahem!
Hmm, never have I ever pretended to be a pizza delivery person so I could get into Jared Leto's Halloween party.
You're a bitch.
My mom was engaged to two pizza delivery guys.
Can that count?
'Cause I am really thirsty.
Stevie!
Uh, um Never have I ever Sorry, I'm just trying to think of something - I haven't done.
- Okay.
How long did you envision this game going on for?
Because never have I ever been so bored.
Aw, I'm sorry, David, when I suggested the game, I didn't expect that you'd be drinking quite so much.
Eating out of the garbage?
Okay, I did that in front of you last night.
Now, as a participant, if we don't change the game soon, - I'm gonna get very drunk.
- Oh.
-  - Yep?
- Hey!
- All: Oh!
There he is!
Yay!
God, what are you doing here?
Hey, sweetie.
You were right, we deserve a night out.
So, I just pushed all my morning appointments.
Which will be fine, I guess, it just means that I'll be staying up 'til 1:00 A.M. on a Saturday, spaying with a pretty shaky hand.
Mm, that's so cute.
What can I get you to drink?
Oh no, don't worry about that.
After you used all of my booze for your punch, the only alcohol left in my fridge was a few of your rum, raspberry, coconut coolers.
So I polished them off, and it tasted like burnt plastic, and I regretted it instantly.
Woman: Hi, Ted!
Only you would wear a little robe, and little slippers to a high school slumber party.
Oh, no, no, no.
This is just so that I didn't get cold on the way over.
- All right!
-  What is the game, because I'm up!
Ohh!
Wow.
- Oh!
- Okay Ted: Twyla!
I'm not sure if it's just the punch, but he could get it!
Stevie, that's disgusting.
Ted, can I get you a party shot?
- Cool!
- Okay.
- David?
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- We have orange - I'll take that.
- Yellow  Hey!
Do you wanna put Emir away for a hot sec, so this game can keep going, and the party can end soon?
Oh, I'm good.
I don't wanna kiss anyone here.
My sister's sitting in the circle, You think I'm dying to play?
Thank you very much.
Ohh!
Oh!
Okay!
Babe, did you rig this?
Maybe I did, and maybe I did!
- Ooh!
-  - Okay, go crazy, babe.
- Mhmm.
All right, who's the lucky lady?
- That's offensive.
- Okay, anyway, re-spin!
Yeah, it actually looks like it sorta landed - between two people.
- No, no, no, no!
I know exactly who it landed on.
Oh, Ted!
That's not okay.
Man, come here, big guy!
- Mmmph!
- Partygoers:  Muah!
Oh my  God.
It looks like the punch needs a refill.
Oh hey, I could use a refill too, big guy.
Okay, I don't know where "big guy" is coming from, but it needs to stop.
Um, I don't know about you, but I smell drama.
Twyla: Okay, my turn!
Moira:  You know Helen, despite everything Oh, if it weren't for Joyce Dewitt insisting on wearing those pigtails, this movie could've been a hit!
We're supposed to be astrophysicists, it just takes you out of it.
And yet, she, she gets the close up!
- Well, that was shocking.
- I know, right?
And I get the aerial shot for my love scene.
No, no, I'm talking about the kid.
To think this little thing could create so much destruction.
Oh, you've completed the diaper substitution.
Aren't you the Sephardic Mr. Clean!
Well, I did the kid, but I'm not doing the bathroom.
It appears you may need a change yourself, Mr. Rose.
What is that on your shoulder?
Oh Moira, he spit up on me.
And he's spit up in the playpen!
Ew!
That cannot be good, John!
Its body is ejecting things, what did you do to it?
!
Nothing!
I-I changed his diaper, that's all.
Well, perhaps you've swaddled its abdomen too tightly, Or maybe it's allergic to something.
John, did you feed it shellfish?
What did you do?
!
I've gotta wipe him up, and change his clothes again.
For all we know, it's got crawling pneumonia.
Oh, he doesn't have crawling pneumonia, Moira!
I don't want to say I told you so, but this is an infelicitous burden.
I could be at Ronnie's right now, preparing for the post-screening Q&A.
Well then, go to Ronnie's!
Because I've gotta get him a change of clothes.
Well, at least put the gloves back on.
John, it says right here, spitting up is normal.
Jocelyn's written, "Spit happens".
Very clever.
For Jocelyn.
Partygoers:  Oh my God, they just need to chill.
David: Okay, I'm done.
Who chose this theme, anyway?
It was a mistake.
What are you guys doing over here?
You remind me of me at a high school house party judging all the attractive and popular kids for being attractive and popular.
David, do you have anything you wanna say - to me and Patrick?
- Actually, yes.
Now, as an attractive and popular kid at a house party, I can confidently say, - it's very fun.
- That's it?
That's all you have to say?
What's going on here?
Mm, things got effed, and we're not having fun anymore.
For what it's worth, I'm having a great time.
You're like a tsetse fly.
Where's your cell phone boyfriend?
- On my cell phone.
- Okay.
You're not having fun?
I don't know David, sure.
What exactly did I do wrong here?
Oh, I don't know.
David, mmm, was it the time you kissed my boyfriend?
Or was it the time you kissed my boyfriend?
I think it was the time you kissed her boyfriend.
Okay, he kissed me!
And I was just told to have some fun.
So I played the game.
I'm sorry that the bottle landed on me.
Hm, technically it landed between you and Stevie, so.
Yeah.
Okay, so you're upset about this as well, then?
- Looks like it.
- Patrick: No, I'm not!
I'm not upset.
I just, I guess I wonder how you would react if the tables were turned.
Yeah David, like, what would you do if Patrick and I suddenly kissed at a party?
- Yeah.
- Or Patrick and me.
Okay, we're done with you.
It was spin the bottle!
If Patrick was wasted, and spun the bottle, and it landed on you, and you guys kissed, - I wouldn't care.
- You're lying, David.
Okay, is that what needs to happen to clear the air here?
You guys need to kiss?
- David, let's not be dramatic.
- Yeah, maybe it does.
- What?
- Well, by all means.
I think it's actually more the principle of the thing - Okay, here we go.
- Hmm!
-  - Is that really Uh huh.
Mmm!
Mmmm!
Mmmmmmmm!
Yum.
That was fun.
Hey, are we spinning more bottles?
Uh, was that fun for you guys?
- That like, satisfying?
- I was never not okay.
So.
It was really good for me.
I say we play truth or dare.
Oh Stevie, I'm in!
Oh no, Ted.
Get your housecoat and your other slipper.
It is time to go.
- You got it, big guy.
- Okay.
Okay.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Good game!
Look at him.
Awful peaceful when he's sleeping.
Well, we did it, sweetheart.
And, uh what do you think we've learned here today?
That Adelina was grossly underpaid.
No, I mean, we could've been good, hands-on parents if we wanted to.
We've got it in us.
That was never in question, John.
I'm even more convinced that our hands-off approach served them better.
Moira:  I'll go, but not without my cousin!
That had its moments.
When it shone, it shone brightly.
And I have to hand it to DeWitt.
She had a real breakthrough during the denouement.
I believe she believed we were cousins.
- John?
-  -  -  - Roland: Oh, hello!
- Moira: Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
- Greet what?
!
- Shh!
- What?
- I just put him down!
Oh my gosh, you got little Roland Jr. to sleep?
Oh no, I'm talking about John.
Oh.
No, Roland's been asleep for quite some time.
And everything was fine?
No major problems?
He is a slice of meringue, Jocelyn.
You know, I don't know if uh I'm just all zen'd out from an hour and a half of Linda's magic fingers on me, but I can actually see myself leaving Roland Jr. With you people more often.
Ah!
Well, that something Linda might want to massage right out of your mind, the next appointment.
I actually have Ron the next time, we like to mix it up a little bit.
And with that, I believe your little inchling is out past its curfew.
Oh, you get the binger, I'll get the baby.
Okay.
Ohh, jeez.
Look at him.
You know, I almost think I like him better asleep than awake.
-  - He's on my side.
Bye bye.
-  - What?
Oh, shh!
Ahem!
I'm just gonna take the garbage out.
Okay.
Yeah, and if I don't come back, it's probably because I've run off with Ted.
Thanks for the heads up.
We're just gonna go for a ride, see where it takes us.
Maybe start a vet clinic somewhere along the way.
He'll the animals back to heath, I'll offer grooming services.
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I overreacted for a second.
I was just talking to Alexis, and we sorta wound each other worked up.
- And Stevie didn't help.
- Stevie never helps.
So I didn't love seeing my boyfriend kissing some other guy.
I'm sorry, are you saying you were jealous?
David, I'm not playing this game with you.
No, you just said you didn't like seeing your boyfriend kissing another guy.
Okay, fine.
He's a handsome guy.
I might've been a little jealous.
So, you think he's handsome then?
What?
He's like-he goes to the gym.
- Goes to the gym?
- Oh my God.
Wow, okay, so when you said you were jealous, were you saying you were jealous of him, or jealous of me?
Because I thought you were saying you were jealous of him.
Both?
Not the answer I was looking for.
Hey.
Mhmm?
I wonder what would've happened - if we had met in high school.
- Hmm.
Well, unless you were into candy ravers with asymmetrical haircuts and a lot of pacifier necklaces, I think our paths crossed at the right time.
How jealous, though?
Why don't you take out the garbage?
- How jealous were you?
- Nope!
Scale of one to ten.
- Like, enraged, or - Bye, bye.
Like fuming, did you sweat?
- That was fun.
- Yes - That was really fun.
Did you have fun?
- Yes.
- Did everyone had fun?
- Yes, Ted.
That's good, it's good that everyone had fun.
Okay, you still have your slippers on, Yeah, I know, sometimes my feet get really cold - when I drink too much.
- It's not a thing.
- Okay, well, gimme a kiss.
- No!
You kissed my brother tonight, I'm not kissing you after you kissed my brother.
Pffft!
Who kissed your brother?
Okay, it's time for "Fun Ted" to just pass out.
No, he's not even tired.
In fact, if anything, I'd say he's only becoming more fun.
Okay.
Okay!
Okay!
Okay!
I think we should just like, sleep it off.
Okay, okay, okay.
Yeah, yeah.
But first just give your brother a kiss.
- Ew, Ted, Ew!
- Come on.
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
That's you.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1 Roland: Oh Johnny, I wish you had told us it was uh, movie day.
Stevie and I could've come up with some good recommendations for you.
What are we gonna watch, a silent movie from your childhood?
It's not movie day, Roland.
We're watching an instructional video on professional workplace etiquette, and it's clear from the stain on your top that things have gotten just a little lax around here.
I made this at Rose Video a while back, but uh, I think you'll find it holds up pretty well.
Male Narrator: Employee Health and Safety Series.
Moira:  Where is it?
Let's see.
Oh wow, this looks like the videos Joce and I used to make.
Just focus on the content, Roland.
Moira: : "Q, R, S," ah!
There it is.
Here, let me help you with that.
Excuse me, Emilio!
Pause.
That kind of physical touch is inapprop-ri-rate.
Let's rewind, and try again.
And now they're gonna come and do it again!
Where is it?
Let's see.
"Q, R, S," oh!
There it is.
Here, let me help you with that.
Is this what you were looking for?
A double-cassette of the "Best Body Swaps of Sunrise Bay", Season 21?
Yes, thank you.
I've been asked to retrieve it for a customer with wonderful taste.
I value you as a fellow employee.
Perhaps you'd like to meet outside of work for a dinner at my place?
Fast forward!
- Oh!
- Jesus.
Well, it's somewhat dated, but uh I think the principles of etiquette are still applicable today.
Hm.
Pretty timeless.
Yeah.
No, I'm not gonna be the one to tell her.
Tell me what?
No, it's not about you, Moira.
Well, is it about Twyla needing to pick up the pace - on that solo?
- What?
No, it's about the Poison concert tonight being canceled at the casino.
And that's a problem because?
Jocelyn's been looking forward to it for weeks.
This is her one night out.
Not to worry.
If she's anything like I was with a little moppet in the house, she'll find any ruse to escape for an evening.
The Poison concert was merely a device.
Uh oh, ladies!
Somebody better call Poison Control, because tonight's gonna be Nothin' but a good time!
Yeah, I'm not gonna be the one to oh, okay.
Jocelyn, you might want to take a seat.
Oh no, there's no time for that.
No, no, we have to rehearse our Poison medley.
Because when Rikki Rockett makes direct eye contact with you during "Talk Dirty to Me", you are gonna want to talk dirty back!
Oh gals, this is getting painful.
Jocelyn, wonderful news!
They've refunded the price of your ticket for tonight's concert.
What?
But I don't want a refund.
No, the show got pushed.
Looks like they double-booked Poison with The Doodlebops.
And the casino just sent out an apology.
Well, what are we supposed to do now?
!
I didn't pump for four hours straight to get on a chartered bus to go to the end of the street and back!
We could go to the cafe.
Oh!
Well, do they have a smoke machine at the cafe?
!
No, but I can ask George to burn something on the grill.
Moira: This is just sad.
Why can't we still go to the casino?
If I'm holding the truth stick, I was never planning to attend the concert anyway.
I never pegged you for a gambling kind of gal, Moira.
Oh, I'm not above a naughty night of debauchery.
When Condi Rice, and Sharon Stone and I, used to make our annual casino sojourn to Ho Chi Minh City, well, let's just say, toi khong bao gio thua.
Okay, but it's been a really long time since I've spun that roulette wheel.
And this is the only casino I haven't been banned from as an unaccompanied minor.
Well, do we still have a reservation at Bucky's Fried Chicken House?
Yes, but I wouldn't let that stop us!
Alexis: So you just plug in the information, and then it creates the website for you.
So what exactly am I paying you for, then?
I'm your brand consultant, David.
I'm consulting with you on which template to use.
Sorry, I'm just distracted, there's a guy over there currently flirting with my boyfriend.
-  Poor thing.
- I know.
No, I meant you, David.
Oh hi, are you finding everything you're looking for?
Um, actually, I was wondering if I could have a pen and paper?
Hm, you planning on doing some journaling?
Alexis: Hmm.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Um score, Patrick!
Look at you, just drowning in other people's phone numbers.
Who was that hunk with the teeny-weeny little polo?
- His name is Ken.
- Ken!
Just when I thought it was impossible to find a thirty-something named Ken!
Oh, I think he looked younger than 30.
Get fucked Alexis!
What exactly did Ken do with my pen?
Did he write down a banana bread recipe?
Or was he looking for directions to some place?
- This is his phone number.
- Yes, it is.
Yeah.
Look at you go.
- Mhmm.
- And he like gave it to you in front of David, so clearly no threat there.
Hey Alexis, find a stick Can I at just enjoy this for a second?
Of course, yeah!
Enjoy Ken.
I mean, I think it's funny 'cause when he first walked in here I was gonna help him, so to think it could've been me enjoying Ken.
Yeah, I don't think so.
- Yeah, I think he liked me.
- This is fun!
It's the great thing about owning a store, really, is getting to flirt with the customers.
You know, just last week, A woman came in and gave me her number.
Do you mean the woman who wanted to know when the soap would be back in stock?
Who came in here with her husband and kids?
Hasn't stopped me before.
But thank you for reminding me, I have to call her, the soap did come back in.
I'm just gonna put that right there.
Mhmm.
Johnny: Stevie?
Stevie: Just a minute!
Oh, I was talking to Roland about the latticework, and we figure if we uh, put the vines right up - the side of the motel oh!
- Steve: Oh!
Oh!
Oh my God, Mr. Rose!
Oh!
Okay.
No, no, no, that's okay.
I'm sorry.
- I said just a minute!
- Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I-I was coming back to you, because I-I figured, you know, you'd be busy back there.
I was busy!
- Taking a personal photo - Right, right.
For my doctor.
Right, well, it was, it was a medical uh, photo, and, and uh and you what?
You text or email this right back to your doctor, I mean, what a-what an age we live in!
I thought you were running errands!
I was, I was, and-and uh I was at the nursery, there were no cars absolutely on the way home, and uh, so it was clear sailing, and that's what I was gonna tell you when I - until I - Okay!
I am kind of seeing somebody, and it's like, a long-distance thing, so I Yeah, okay, I'm gonna stop, I'm gonna stop you right there.
I wish we had gotten to the second tape in the workplace etiquette series, that had a whole chunk on Polaroids.
- Oh my God!
- Um, Stevie, look, look!
All I saw was a business partner communicating with a friend, that's all.
Although you've just explained that it was a more intimate relationship with this uh, chap.
But uh, congratulations, by the way.
If-if uh, you know.
I think I need to take a walk around the block.
- Mhmm?
- So, like, a couple of thousand times.
Okay, that's a good idea.
Yeah, sure, sure.
Take a walk.
And uh, you know, uh, get some, get some fresh air, and you know, clear your head.
And if you feel the need to finish that communication by the way, with your friend, just uh, maybe try and find a room with a locked door?
But everything's okay Stevie, don't worry about that.
We're  - I waited 35 minutes!
- Oh, don't start.
Oh, please, save your applause for Jocelyn, - who's right behind me.
-  You know what?
I was going to change and then I thought, no, if my babysitter can show up wearing a crop top the size of a bib, I can wear this to a casino!
Jocelyn, you look amazing.
Yes, why not throw caution and the dress code to the wind?
I'm sure the maÃ®tre d' at Bucky's will make an exception!
- Let's get goin'!
-  If the bus is a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'!
Jazzagals: Wooo!
Yeah!
Moira: I've come prepared with casino must-haves: oxygen drops, antibacterial wipes, and military-grade caffeine pills.
The pills came from Condi, so if anyone asks, you found them on the floor.
Mrs. Rose, when you said you were bringing essentials, I thought you meant snacks, and something to drink.
No.
- Well, nothing for the road?
- Don't worry ladies, I've got you covered, this afternoon I made some - magic brownies!
-  THC and carbohydrates.
Oh Moira, we don't expect you to have one.
One?
At least one.
Okay  Who wants some zhampagne?
Jazzagals: Yeah!
Wooo!
So, whatever happened to that phone number?
Uh, it might still be in my pocket.
Why?
Hm.
Just keeping it close?
Well, I haven't thrown it out yet.
What are you doing?
!
I'm obviously not gonna use it.
Why not?
Uh, because I'm in a committed relationship.
I know that.
- I think you should call him.
- What?
!
Skin-tight clothes aside, do you find Ken attractive?
I mean, sure.
Then I think you should call him!
David!
Consider it a selfish act on my part.
You have only been with me.
And Rachel, and like, a handful of other girls.
Okay, we've all been with a handful of other girls.
- But I'm the only guy.
- So?
So inevitably there might come a point where you find yourself curious about being with other people.
So why not explore that now, so that we don't have to have this conversation five years down the line.
Oh, so you think we're gonna be together 5-years from now?
I think a cute boy gave you his number, and you should go for dinner, and run free.
Best case scenario, you realize how good you have it with me.
Worst case scenario, you realize how good you have it with me.
Fun!
Stevie: Okay, Mr. Rose?
Uh, I've thought a lot about what happened, uh, maybe a little too much about what happened.
And I think for the sake of the business, that we should just put it all behind us.
- Okay, good.
- Good.
Thank you, Stevie.
What happened?
Mr. Rose saw me topless.
- Oh!
Oh!
- No!
No!
I I didn't completely see anything, but I got the gist of what you were doing.
I didn't know anyone was here!
Oh Johnny, I don't think the woman in that video would approve.
The woman on the video is Moira, and no, she would not approve!
I would not approve!
It was an accident.
Trust me, it will never happen again.
Understood.
I really don't know what to say to the two of you.
Well, you don't have to say anything, Roland.
Less is more in a situation like this.
Well, I did just think of one thing.
- Please don't!
- It's more of a limerick.
All right, enough, Roland.
Thank you, we're going to move on now.
Stevie, Room Three needs a change over.
I would be happy to leave and do that.
- Thanks.
-  Whoa!
Aah!
Stevie!
Your friend just responded!
- Oh my God, gimme that!
- Hmm.
Oh my uh, I'll be taking the rest of the day off.
Okay.
-  - Yeah I'd say her friend responded.
Alexis: Hey, can you give me a ride to Ted's?
It's basically on the way to Patrick's.
It's in the opposite direction, and I'm not going to Patrick's tonight.
Why?
Because we don't have plans tonight.
- He has plans with someone else.
- Who?
Okay, can you utilize like, a little bit more of the English language?
If you must know, I sent Patrick off to have dinner with that guy who gave him his number today.
That hot piece from the store?
Why would you do that?
Because I think it's funny, and I also think it's important for Patrick to experience other people in order to realize how good he has it with me.
What if he doesn't come to that realization?
Every time I did that with a boyfriend, I'd send them off with someone who like, wasn't a threat.
Like, Pippa Middleton, or Rihanna.
Okay, well, I hardly think Ken is a threat.
Mm, tell that to his million dollar smile, David.
- Okay.
- So what are the GRs?
- The what?
- The ground rules.
What ground rules did you lay down before you sent him off with that hottie-boom-bottie?
Okay, I haven't sent him off with ground rules, because this is a one-night thing.
Did you say that?
No.
So at this point he could like, spend the night, double-dip, - kiss on the lips!
- I don't know!
Okay, this is why you have ground rules, David!
Josh Groban has a thick, leather-bound binder full of them.
Patrick didn't even wanna do this.
I basically forced him into it.
Is it too late for any amendments?
I thought this was a good idea, and now you're making me feel like I made a mistake.
Okay, you haven't made a huge mistake yet, David, we probably won't find out about that until tomorrow.
Okay, I have never been in this position before, usually I'm the one finding out I'm in an open relationship after the fact, and now you're making me feel like I've just shipped my boyfriend off to fall in love with someone else!
Ugh!
I was supposed to go to dinner with Ted, David!
Then go for dinner with Ted!
Well, now I feel like I should be here for you!
Why?
Let's just hope we don't find out.
What?
!
Ugh  Are we up yet?
It's either black or red, even or odd.
And you never know where you're gonna land.
I'm sorry, Jocelyn?
If you'dve told me 20-years-ago I'd be standing here with an empty chip bucket, stoned out of my mind at a Doodlebops concert, I would've lit a menthol, and had a laugh.
You went to that show?
I stepped in briefly, Roland Jr.'s a huge fan of "Wobbly Whoopsy".
Moira, you may not believe this, but I used to rock out.
Well, of course you did, as did anyone with brain cells to kill.
I'm thinking of a particular night in Monaco with Maggie Trudeau and the Rolling Stones.
You rocked with the Stones?
All except Charlie, but every party has a pooper.
Moira, it's like, on the inside I feel like I'm 19-years-old, and then I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, and realize that I'm so not.
Oh Jocelyn, you'll soon learn that we aging mortals are blessed with weakening eyes and memories so we don't have to really see ourselves.
If you love the number 19, you go be 19.
And while you're at it, bet on it.
I can't take all of these!
It only looks like a lot.
Do as you will.
Jocelyn, but whatever you do, rock onwards and upwards!
Mhmm!
Yeah!
- Ah, Stevie.
- Oh my God!
I forgot my bag, and I thought you might have gone home for the night, so Oh no, I was just about to leave, but uh, I'm glad I caught you.
Can we pretend today didn't happen?
Oh, consider it erased.
Thank you.
Although, I did wanna say just one thing, if I could put my friend cap on for a minute.
I'm glad things are working out with you and your gentleman friend.
And I'm just piecing things together here.
Thank you, Mr. Rose.
I hope he makes you happy, Stevie, and that's all that matters to me.
And from this point forward, I am staying out of it.
We never have to talk about this again.
Okay.
Remember Emir?
The guy who came to review the motel?
The one who asked you to lunch?
Yes, that would be him.
Oh!
Well, he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah.
- Good job.
Good taste in motels.
And clearly he likes you a lot.
And I'm not saying that just because of the photo.
Oh my God, Mr. Rose!
- Okay, rewind, please.
- See you tomorrow!
Yeah, okay, see you tomorrow, Stevie.
Does anyone want more Bucky's?
No!
Who knew everything would contain chicken?
Oh, that dessert menu was especially disappointing.
"Black forest tenders".
Jocelyn's still not answering her phone.
Well, somebody ought to go look for her!
Tah-dah!
Oh, Jocelyn, is that you?
Yes!
I took your advice, Moira.
And what advice was that?
!
Yes, Jocelyn, what advice did I impart that translated into this daring new coiffure?
That I can still rock on!
Your chips bought this!
And you certainly risked it all, didn't you?
Yeah!
I'm ready to go home.
Okay.
Wow, Jocelyn.
It must feel so light and breezy.
Mhmm!
Ha ha!
Yeah.
Yes, I love it, too.
I know.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Do you recognize me from earlier?
I have a new hairdo!
Alexis: Hey Ted, I'll be there soon, but I just can't leave David alone right now.
Yeah, no, apparently they left for dinner at seven.
Radio silence.
Nothing, not a word.
Anyway, I will be there soon, and I love you so much.
Okay Oh my God, imagine?
Muah!
Muah!
This is not how I wanted to spend my night.
Me neither.
And David, I know what you're thinking, they're probably back at his house, listening to Frank Ocean, laughing, and re-hydrating.
Yeah, the more I think about this, the more I realize it was way too early to have introduced this into the relationship.
I mean, I thought I was being mature, but in actuality, it was just a classic case of self-sabotage.
Chill, David.
Hey!
Yes, those are all valid points, but this is a moment of growth for you.
Was it flawlessly executed?
No.
Would I have done it?
Hell no.
Okay, if this is intended to be helpful, - you can leave now.
- But what I was gonna say is, if a cute guy that walks into your store is enough to unravel your whole relationship, you're better off knowing that now, than in a year from now.
Do I want to hear about it?
I couldn't do it.
Oh.
Come in.
I don't want to date Ken!
I don't think I ever said "date".
Was it the lack of ground rules?
- Hi.
David - Mhmm?
I love you, and I really appreciate what you were trying to do for me, but I feel no need to meet up with other guys right now.
Okay, I mean if that's what you want, then I guess I'm I'm fine with it, I mean, I'm easy either way.
Oh.
Also, this is gonna sound totally petty, but something about his shoes just made me feel really weird, 'cause they were like, long and pointy, but then - Squared off at the toe.
- Yes!
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
I know, it's okay.
It's okay.
Okay, this is a really long hug now.
Just need one more minute, mhmm.
We all still like it, right?
I think it really brings out my eyes, right, Gals?
Sure.
It's not like we think it's a mistake, or we regret it, right?
Oh, you never regret a good time, Jocelyn.
Thank you, Moira.
You'd tell me the truth, I know.
It's really short.
Every rose has its thorn
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1  - Hmm.
David.
- Hmm?
Perhaps your indigestion is caused by the speed with which you consume your food.
We should do breakfast more often, this is really fun.
Mhmm.
- Hi, Mrs. Rose.
- Hello, Patrick.
- Care to ensconce yourself?
- Oh, I wish I could.
- Um, David?
- Hmm?
You told me you were just running across the street - for a cup of coffee.
- But then I got hungry.
I hadn't eaten since last night.
It's just that I have to get ready for my audition, and somebody has to be at the store, so.
You're being audited?
Those bastards!
No, uh, audition.
I'm actually trying out for "Cabaret".
"Cabaret".
You're familiar with the show?
Please don't start.
- The year was 1979.
- '79.
Mhmm.
I was but 17.
- She was not 17.
- Ah.
Hostessing at a charming gas station deli, when the great director, Rocky Nickels, came in for a Reuben.
That's a sandwich.
Little did he know, he would end up biting into something - far more suffonsifying.
- Far more suffonsifying.
A ripe young actress who he'd soon cast in the leading role of Sally Bowles.
Sally Bowles, yes.
- In the production of -  "Cabaret".
Yes!
Ask me how many ovations I got on closing night.
- Six.
- David, you know the answer!
That's a lot of ovations.
Mhmm, three by demand, and three on the house.
And who, may I ask, is bold enough to scale this cultural monolith?
Jocelyn's actually directing for the community theater, so.
Jocelyn?
That's very ambitious of Jocelyn.
Yeah well, I just thought it could be a fun thing to do.
Yes, the exact sentiment expressed by the passengers as they stepped aboard the Titanic.
Okay, well, that's really encouraging.
What?
!
They were having a rip-roaring bash before that bloody iceberg.
- I'm just gonna get the bill.
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.
- I'll be just two minutes.
- Okay.
Hey, Stevie.
Excuse me, I'll just be a minute.
I just heard from Alexis that Ted's mom, Cheryl, will be coming in from Elm Ridge, and joining us for the weekend.
So uh, I'd like to just keep an eye out for her, okay?
She's a lovely woman, very striking, - full-figured - Mr. Rose!
It's Cheryl Mullens.
- Cheryl!
- Yes!
Oh, I-I-I I didn't recognize you there for some reason.
Well, I lost 80 pounds, I changed my diet, and I started taking Zumba classes.
Well, good for Zumba.
And you haven't changed at all, Johnny.
Still as handsome as ever.
Oh, well, there you go.
Uh anyway, we're gonna put you in our best room, okay?
- Aw!
- And, tell you what.
It's on us, Cheryl.
- Is it?
!
- Thank you.
You're a sweetheart.
They don't make men like you anymore.
Well, we try to treat people good.
Try to treat good  have a nice room.
Day!
Day.
Have a nice day in your room.
- What?
- You gonna be okay?
Yeah.
- Jocelyn!
- What the Moira!
You really snuck up on me there.
Those shoes do not make a sound.
- Blame Wang.
- What're you doing here?
Alas, I was sure there was a council-related symposium here this afternoon, but it appears the room has been set up in an audition configuration?
I'm so glad I'm doing it right.
Today is day one of auditions for "Cabaret".
"Cabaret"!
Yeah, I actually wanted to do "Cats", but everybody said that it was too political, so.
I'm not sure you're aware of this Jocelyn, but "Cabaret" is the very show that launched my career.
- Right!
- Mhmm.
1979, you had a Reuben.
No, but never mind.
I'm simply here to wish you the best of luck.
Moira since you have the strong personal connection to "Cabaret", do you think that you could help me?
No, this is your bebe, Jocelyn, and an artistic cradle robber, I am not.
Okay, it's just that I have this actual baby at home, plus a whole lot of term papers to grade.
I wouldn't want to step on anyone's toes.
But if you would indulge me a promenade along memory lane, I'd love to sit in on the auditions.
Okay, if that's as much as you're willing to contribute.
- All righty.
- It's settled, then.
Consider me a silent monarch on the wall.
- Will do.
- Now, Jocelyn is this really how you want to set up the chairs?
- No?
- Oh God, no!
Roland.
You brought a baby into the store.
Shhh.
Yeah.
And I don't know why I haven't brought him in sooner, this place is perfect.
Thank you so much.
Yeah, they say that babies fall asleep quickest when they're surrounded by an eerie, almost crypt-like silence.
What can I do to shorten your stay in my store, Roland?
Oh, uh, Joce wanted me to pick up uh, some of this.
This organic applesauce.
Organic.
Listen to me!
Who am I?
Gwyneth Paltrow?
No, no, you're not.
-  - Ah.
Ooh sorry, I gotta take this.
What about this, though?
Uh, hello?
Ronnie.
Hi, what's going on?
-  No!
Oh my God!
- What?
Dave, please, I'm on a private call.
Uh huh, okay, I'll be right over.
Oh boy, sheeesh.
Everything okay?
Well, Gwen was trimming that big oak tree behind her place, and she took out a power line, and now there are live wires flailing every which way but loose.
So I guess uh, Rollie Jr. and I should head over there.
Hey, this applesauce, it's not gonna go bad in the sun, is it?
I'd be more concerned about the baby, - but what do I know?
- You're right!
You know what I'll do?
I'll leave 'em both here.
No!
No, absolutely not!
I have a meeting in half an hour with a potential big money client, and a rogue baby in my store does not present as polished, - or professional.
- He'll be fine.
If he gets cranky, give him some applesauce.
Those are $10 a jar!
- Okay.
- Dammit!
No, I will not accept that.
No, but I entered that in there already.
Dad, Cheryl wants to take a shower, and all she has is a facecloth.
Oh, okay.
Well, Stevie uh can you run some towels down to room four?
- Why do I need to do it?
- Okay, what's the big deal?
Just walk them over, and drop them off.
Well, Alexis, if you must know, when I was checking Cheryl in this morning, I-I got a bit of a vibe.
Ew, what kind of vibe?
I think I might've gotten a whisper of desire.
"Whisper of des " Oh my God!
Please never use that phrase like, ever again.
My face was touched.
She was doing this.
She called me handsome!
Okay, Cheryl is in a happy marriage.
She just happens to be very like, warm, and affectionate.
Her hand was warm and affectionate.
Ted!
Hi!
Uh, my mom was just wondering if she could maybe get some towels?
Towels?
Yes!
And perhaps you could take these to her?
Oh yeah, sure.
My mom also wants you to join us for lunch today.
She said she won't take no for an answer.
Uh, that would leave Stevie alone here at the counter.
And I-I don't think that uh Oh, but I prefer it that way, though.
Oh my God, Dad, um yes, he can come.
Okay great, I'll go let her know.
She was just saying how she wants to get - to know you better.
- Hmm.
Hmm.
Psh!
Shh!
Wait!
Do you hear that?
- What?
- It's like a faint whisper of desire.
- That was a good one.
- Thanks!
Oh boy.
Don't do that.
Jocelyn: Wow, Bob.
Who knew you were a man of so many talents?
Well, I don't need to see any more.
- Bob - Ahem!
Moira, is there anything you'd like to add to Bob's audition?
I'm just marinating in memories.
Okay well, we start rehearsals But while I marinate, it might be worth observing your giving Bob a slight redirection.
- Mhmm - If that's all right?
Oh, I've cleared my afternoon for this.
Okay, uh well, try it um, angrier?
You know, like, grr, put your hands on your hips.
Like this?
Oh dear.
Okay.
Well, it seems to me, that it would be helpful to both of us if you would just join us here at the table.
Well, there's a note I'm incapable of rebuffing.
You heard the director.
Thank you.
Do you want me to sing "Ave Maria" again?
If you must, but I think what Jocelyn is looking for here is a foreboding vibration of pre-war Berlin, easy on the accent.
Roger that, yeah.
Okay, so this is what we call mutual respect.
So if you could just stay like this for the an hour, that would be ideal.
Okay.
- Hi, David?
- Tina?
- Mhmm.
- Oh my goodness!
We are so excited at the prospect of working with "Premium Parties".
- Oh, that's very sweet.
- Yeah, so as you know, we can source basically anything you need when it comes to party essentials.
Gift bags, catering, Shaman-blessed crystals, artisanal Reiki gloves.
For today, I was just hoping to hear about the store, and make a connection with you.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, no, I love making connections.
Oh.
Oh no, that's not Oh, I didn't know that you had a little guy!
Yeah, his dad is just out right now, but he should be back any time.
Oh yeah, they say that, and next thing you know, it's been an hour, am I right?
Yes.
Yeah.
They say it's an emergency, but is it really, Tina?
Yeah, so tell me the last time that watching the new "Fast and the Furious" was an emergency!
You know, I have a two-year-old at home.
- Oh.
- How old's this little one?
He's um, three to four months.
- Oh, wow.
- Mhmm.
He's huge for four months.
- Mm, big eater.
- Ah.
You know, we-we do sell these delicious granola bars.
You're giving him granola?
No, no, I eat the granola bars, while taking care of him.
He prefers um the organic applesauce.
It must be so helpful to have your own little product tester here in the store with you.
You know what?
Why don't you take this home with you, try it out on your little one.
You know, I'm actually throwing a baby shower next week, uh, but I mean, that's probably not enough notice for you.
I threw a baby shower for my dear friend, Jocelyn, within a day, I'm pretty sure I can get supplies by next week.
You two might be my new favourite vendors.
Do you think that maybe he could um, show me around?
Yeah.
You want, you wanna show her around, - little tyke?
- Show me around.
Hm.
Cheryl: And there he was, naked as the day he was born, just wailing!
It had rained, and his cotton candy was melting all down his hand!
Yeah, that was fun, but uh, maybe we can start telling some stories about someone else who was naked and crying?
Okay, fine, but I think everyone here has already heard about my Vin Diesel adventure.
Mind if I have a fry, Johnny?
No, no, go ahead, help yourself.
And if anyone else wants a fry, please feel free to take one.
Mom, I really wish I'd have known about this trip a little bit sooner, I wouldn't have asked Alexis to help me out at the clinic today, and she could've kept you company.
Mhmm, I also wish you hadn't asked me to help out - at the clinic today.
- Oh, don't worry, this was just a last minute whim.
I just don't know what I'm gonna do with those tickets that I bought to the Elmdale Gallery.
Johnny I don't suppose you'd be interested in playing - hooky today, huh?
- Oh, no!
I haven't played hooky since college.
Dad, I think you can spare a couple of hours to accompany Mrs. Mullens, who otherwise would be going by herself.
Well, when you put it that way, Alexis, uh, I'd look like a real jerk if I said no.
Then lunch is on me.
A free room and now a hot date with the owner of the motel?
Lucky me!
Yeah I can't tell you how much this means to me, Mr. Rose.
Oh, I'm just being a good host.
See, my mom and my Step-Dad separated a while ago.
What?
Why have I not heard about this before?
Well, I wanted to tell you, but she made me promise to keep it quiet.
You know, small town, people talk.
So Ted, your mom is currently unattached?
Yeah, yeah, but she's in a much better place these days.
She's got like, a whole new lease on life.
She told me that she's just going after whatever she wants, no holds barred!
Oh, well hopefully, some holds barred.
- Johnny?
- Hmm?
- I'm ready to go.
- Oh!
Um Dad, if you do have too much work this afternoon Well, we're in it now, Alexis.
- Here we go.
Oh, after you.
- Oh!
- Please, don't go.
- Are you serious?
Jocelyn: Okay, I'm just gonna stop you there.
Thank you.
Um Beth, I was wondering if you could maybe Dig deeper, yeah.
Let's throw away the lines, soften the edges.
Yes, I was gonna say, speak louder, but that also sounds important.
- So why don't we um - Yes, tap her out!
You step in, and lay the groundwork for Patrick.
Yes.
You want me to tap in and act with him?
Mea culpa, Jocelyn, I sorely underestimated your instincts.
Okay.
Okay, the thing you must understand about Cliff, Patrick, is that he has been with many women, but he's never derived true pleasure from it.
I think I can wrap my head around that.
Okay, when you're ready.
Don't go.
- What?
- Please, don't go!
Ooh, less desperation.
Are you serious?
The hell with Bobby!
Maybe I like you here.
Firm, but not loud.
The truth is, Sally, when you're out all night, I can't sleep.
Better, better.
Now seduce her.
Oh my.
Our little bed suddenly seems so empty.
I've never felt this way about anyone.
You truly mean this?
Bring it home More than I've ever meant anything.
And, scene!
Oh!
Whew!
Now that is a breakthrough.
Patrick, thank you.
Or should I say thank you to our new Emcee!
Oh no, no, Patrick was auditioning - for the role of Cliff.
- Yes, he was.
But we all know you put your biggest talent front and center.
- Isn't that right, Jocelyn?
- Sure.
As long as I never have to act again.
Okay, no.
Thank you!
We'll-we'll call your people.
I did not think I would find a new vendor today.
Well, sometimes it just clicks.
Here.
Well, why don't I swing back on Wednesday, and pick everything up for the baby shower?
Perfect!
And I hope I'll see you on Wednesday, too!
Hey!
- How's my big boy?
- This must be Dad.
- Yes.
- Roland Schitt.
Tina Holbridge.
It is so nice to meet you.
I've just been spending the whole afternoon with your two special guys.
Oh, well, you know, Roland Jr. and I, are gettin' there, but uh, this guy, I've known him for a long time.
You know that he uh, took me shopping once?
Yeah, you know what?
Are you ready to take um, him?
Because I'm sure you have a busy day.
Yeah, I should probably grab him, and go.
I'm sorry, I would've been here sooner, but I got electrocuted three times, and the last time I didn't bounce back quite as fast.
Oh.
Well, the important part is that you're-you're here now.
Yeah, and luckily Gwen's fine, too.
I don't know why she was wearing that rubber dress when she cut that wire, but it saved her life.
- Hmm!
- Wow Well, I should probably let you guys have some family time.
I am so looking forward to working with you, David.
Likewise.
Hey, sounds like the meeting went pretty well.
It couldn't have gone better!
Yeah.
So, if ever you need me to babysit this little one, I have some openings.
Oh, well, that's great, because Joce and I were thinking about going to the movies tomorrow night.
I was thinking next Wednesday between four and five pm.
Mm, yeah, no, Thursday, that's probably gonna be better for us.
Let's go with Wednesday.
Thank you, Johnny, for a lovely afternoon.
Well, it's always a thrill to experience a collection of nude photographs with a a new friend.
It was eye-opening.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
-  - Uh huh?
Umm, what's going on over here?
Hey, you crazy kids.
Hope you didn't have too much fun this afternoon.
Alexis, I was just about to tell Johnny, so I might as well tell you, too.
Ted's Step-Dad and I have separated.
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh!
It's for the best.
In fact, I think I've already started to develop feelings - for someone new.
- So soon?
- You wanna know the best part?
- Not necessarily.
He's charming, and handsome.
Okay, I think we understand where this is going.
And ten years younger!
Than?
I've fallen for my Zumba instructor.
- Bill?
- Bill.
Well, Bill's great!
Does this mean that I get his gym discount?
- It does!
- Awww!
This is great news.
Isn't this great news, Dad?
Yes, yes, I'm relieved - that you're so happy.
- Mhmm.
Thank you for providing such a safe place for me this afternoon.
You know, you remind me of my older brother.
Hey, maybe I should start calling you "Uncle Johnny," then, huh?
- Oh, ha ha ha.
- No.
Nope.
Nope.
Mom, come on, tell me all about it.
Oh!
I'm just worried about what that young, hot young Zumba instructor is gonna do when he finds out that Cheryl has a huge crush on you.
Okay, Alexis.
But you bought into it for a second there.
Well that was a great day of auditions today, Moira.
Agreed.
Wow, in a desert of mediocrity, you managed to divine a quiet revelation in Ronnie's Fraulein Schneider.
Well, I think you deserve most of the credit.
You know, watching you work with the actors today, I think it was pretty obvious that you should Reprise my role of Sally?
Uh, maybe?
But There's the age discrepancy.
Bit of a challenge there.
Although I did play Liesl Von Trapp at 50.
Actually working with you made me realize that I may not have the skills to do this.
But you, you were practically directly by yourself today.
Oh, Jocelyn, thank you.
And now I fear I've overstepped.
No, no, no, please!
Step all over me.
You should be the director, it's clearly in your blood.
Well, humility forbids me from thinking I could become a quadruple threat that easily.
Please, Moira.
You'd be doing me a favour.
I mean, it's either that, or you could call Mr. and Mrs. Tekenos and let them know that their daughter bit another student at school today.
- I accept.
- Thank you, Moira!
I am happily stepping down.
In title only.
You will be there with me every step of the way, Jocelyn.
Assistant directing.
- Assistant directing?
- Mhmm, some would argue it's even more responsibility than directing.
What have I done?
No!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1 It's the last day of our auditions, Moira.
We might have to lower our standards if we're gonna find our lead.
Lowering your standards is a slippery slope, Jocelyn.
Next thing I know you'll be telling me we'll be staging this production at the school gymnasium.
Very dapper, Mr. Rose!
Like the maestro of a Lebanese orchestra.
Congratulations Johnny, I never thought I'd see this little motel recognized for anything, besides the occasional cockroach!
I made myself laugh there.
Well, always nice to be nominated, Jocelyn.
But I'm not putting too much stock in regional hospitality awards.
The revisions for your acceptance speech are on the vanity, dear.
Oh thank you, sweetheart.
So how's the uh, casting hunt going?
Oh, disconsolate, John.
We may be looking at putting an ad in broadwayworld.com.
Perhaps there's a chorus girl on holiday, looking for a leg up.
Okay, hi!
First of all, I'd like to remind you that this is a live-work space, and second, fine, I'll do it.
Do what, dear?
I'll step in as the star of your musical.
No!
No, with your responsibilities as our in-house publicist, I couldn't ask you to do that now.
Okay, well, you seem pretty desperate, so I'm happy to help.
Johnny: Well Moira, I'd consider it.
I mean, we did spend all that money flying in Barbara Streisand's vocal coach that summer Alexis wanted to be the next Jessica Simpson.
Alexis, a brief stint on a reality show, that's one thing, but acting, that's Um, the producers of "A Little Bit Alexis" insisted that I take acting classes after we started shooting, so.
Almost makes me want to try out for it myself.
Okay, now we're all just getting the sillies.
Best we stick to our award-nominated day jobs.
Well, I'm sure that Alexis has a song that she could sing for the audition.
Audition?
Okay, do I have to remind you about the album that I released?
Moira, what's the worst that can happen?
Besides the inevitable accusations of nepotism!
Well, for what it's worth, Alexis, I always thought "Hampton's Hoes" was quite catchy.
Boop!
Johnny: Oh, Stevie.
You look very nice.
- No, I don't.
- Uh, yes, you do!
Very spiffy!
That's a lovely dress.
I literally pulled it out of the laundry, Mr. Rose.
I've had it forever.
You know it's not a bad thing to admit you really care about these awards, Stevie.
You're bringing a bag?
You know, I almost brought a change of clothes myself.
Moira told me to pack a second suit for the after-party, but uh, who am I, George Clooney?
No, Mr. Rose, that's a weekend bag.
I'm going away for the weekend.
Oh.
I told you I'm taking Monday off!
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going someplace.
Uh, Emir is presenting at the awards, so I just thought I might drive around with him for a few days after.
Oh so it sounds like you two are getting pretty serious?
Uh, I guess we'll see what happens this weekend.
Roland: Hello, guys, uh whoa!
Look at us!
Who are we?
Brad Pitt and his handsome brother?
And Johnny?
Why the jacket, Roland?
You know you're not going to the awards.
Johnny, you asked me to manage the motel while you were away.
I'm not gonna show up just dressed like some schlub off the street!
Like you do every day?
Wow, okay.
This one puts on a dress and suddenly she's Rita Rudner.
Guys, I am really gonna miss this workplace banter.
- We are coming back, Roland.
- Oh.
At least I'm coming back, I don't know about Stevie.
Oh my God, we should really get going.
How about one picture before we go?
Roland: Great idea, okay.
Stevie, do you mind?
Here we go.
I meant a picture of me and Stevie.
Absolutely, no, that makes perfect sense.
Okay.
And everybody Put Mr. Rose in it.
I just don't get the big reveal, it's a bathroom.
It's not just a bathroom, David, it's a passion project.
I'd kill to be that passionate about a bathroom that you've now decided to open up to the entire town.
Yeah well, we can't afford to keep a private bathroom, David, we're losing customers to the cafe.
Besides, you're the one who started serving booze at those evening events.
Um, those evening events are part of a summer series.
- Oh - We sold 30 dreamcatchers at that Cosmic Meditation Clinic.
Huh.
Yeah, you know what?
You were right.
It does look beautiful.
- What the f - So, I'm confused.
Where does the bathroom start, and all this garbage end?
Ronnie swore this would be done today.
Ronnie: Yep, but you ran out of tiles.
It doesn't help that you picked the most expensive ones.
Okay, you asked for my opinion, I don't know how much Romanian marble costs!
I was hoping to get my hands on a few more in an hour or so, but that is TBC at this point.
Okay, Ronnie, uh, this installation was just supposed to last two days.
And now half of our store is covered in tarps, and David's organized some writers' retreat for tomorrow night.
It's a calligraphy workshop.
We're working as fast as we can, you have my cell!
Could you have not at least asked her to finesse the tarps?
I mean, there's green tape everywhere!
The tarps aren't staying up, David.
This bathroom's getting finished today, because that's what we discussed, - that's what's gonna happen.
- Okay, it's just that you waited until after she left to put your lil' foot down, so I'm just not sure if she's aware of that plan.
She obviously thinks we're a couple of pushovers.
Okay, speak for yourself.
All I did was pick out some gorgeous tile.
I'm pregnant.
That's it, that's the end of my audition.
- Indeed it is.
- I'm fine with nudity.
Not necessary.
Thank you.
She looks like she may have seen the inside of a smoky German bar or two.
Who knows, a haircut, some dance lessons Moira, I feel like we're really scraping the bottom of the barrel here.
I think that we should bring Alexis in.
Jabberwocky!
There are still stones left unturned!
Okay, you're actively trying to prevent Alexis from auditioning here, and I don't want to get in the middle of some mother daughter competition thing, Competition!
Nothing of the sort.
No, Alexis just doesn't have the - life experience.
- Really?
Because according to her stories Well, she's had her fair share of adventures, yes.
But the role of Sally Bowles requires an actress who can mine a deeper, darker cave.
A woman encumbered with secrets she will take with her to the tomb.
Hence the high praise Gina Gershon and I received for the role.
You know what, Moira?
I'm gonna bring Alexis in.
And don't worry, I will handle the audition, so it is less of a struggle for you.
Fine, you're on your own.
Boy, it looks like "Best Customer Service in a Motel Under 20 Units" is up fifth, that's the big one.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Stevie, if we win, and I know that's a big "if," do you think you'll be doing any talking up there?
- It's all you, Mr. Rose.
- Okay.
Excuse me, is this the children's table?
Young at heart, maybe.
Johnny Rose, but I'm sure you remember me, Emir, You declared our motel a "must stay".
How could I forget, Mr. Rose, good to see you.
And you are?
Uh, I'm just waiting for my date.
So that seat's taken.
Oh, well, can I uh buy you a drink while you wait?
I guess, but he won't be too happy about it.
From what I've heard, he'll take what he can get.
- So you're probably safe.
- I should point out, they have been coming by with drink trays.
Oh yeah, we'll just go to the bar.
Okay, well, I'm sure you have some catching up to do.
David, look.
Ronnie is sitting in that booth with Roland, laughing about something.
Okay.
She says she's working as fast as she can.
We don't have a bathroom, David!
I'm well aware of that.
You know, my uncle's a contractor.
I know how this works, you've gotta stay on top of it, or they will find a million reasons to just drag it out.
Mhmm, well, my ex-best friend was a crisis manager, and she told me multiple times, not to talk to anyone.
Especially while they're eating.
So I'm gonna just Roland: Oh hey, Pat.
What are you doing?
Playing hooky, or did the store finally close?
I don't laugh a lot, but that was good.
That is funny, especially considering we are open, but hey, who knows for how long?
Because right now, it sorta looks like a quarantine station.
I'm sorry, are you implying something?
You know, I'm just saying, uh, the bathroom's supposed to be done today, and you say you're working as fast as you can, but uh, here I find you with Roland.
Okay, FYI.
Roland is the hook-up for your tiles.
His cousin, Arnie, gets them at cost.
So I thought I would thank Roland by buying him lunch.
Because that's how I do business.
Makes sense.
I was just sort of uh checking in.
I could always cancel the order, if that's how you wanna do business.
Roland: Ooh!
Ouch.
I would run out and get some aloe Vera pal, 'cause you just got burned.
Hi, is everything okay?
I don't know, you tell me.
Yeah, no, I was just uh, telling Ronnie what a what a great job she's doing on the bathroom.
And uh, we should get back to the store.
Okay, do you still need to use the restroom?
What?
Nope!
Uh, came here for you.
So we should go.
Thanks for checking in.
Is everything okay?
You look more pale than normal.
Okay.
Hi, my name is Alexis Rose, represented by Alexis Rose Talent.
Okay, what are you gonna be singing for us today, Alexis?
I have chosen to perform the title track off of my critically reviewed, limited reality series, - "A Little Bit Alexis".
- Ooh!
Feel free to sing along if you know the words.
Okay.
Are you ready?
Let's do it.
I'm a Lamborghini I'm a Hollywood star I'm a little bit tipsy When I drive my car I'm expensive sushi I'm a huge, huge yacht I'm a little bit single Even when I'm not Ah!
Ah!
I'm little bit I'm a little bit I'm a little bit of la la la-la-la-la-la A little bit Alexis La la la-la-la-la-la A little bit Alexis Oh wow, okay.
- La-la-la - Just wonderful.
Okay, yeah, I still actually had a few more verses.
And in the last verse, I really get to showcase my range.
Oh no, you know what?
I think that just that 30 seconds is more than enough to go off of, yeah.
Are you saying I booked it?
Great question!
Jocelyn?
Well, we do have to see all the other candidates.
But we will definitely get back to you.
Okay.
Okay.
Oooh!
Oh So what do we think?
Well, there is a place for her somewhere.
- On stage?
!
- No!
Moira, I saw your talent, and I thought, well, the apple can't fall far from the tree.
Different orchard, Jocelyn.
Though I do admire the confidence.
What are we gonna do now?
"We"?
We are at the precise intersection of which I tried to steer us clear.
No, Babs Streisand's vocal coach quit the business after just two lessons with our sweet Alexis.
He now lives in a monastery.
Wow, it took a while to get the drinks, yet, I don't see any drinks.
Oh uh, we just finished them at the bar.
Oh, I see.
Well, you got back at the perfect time.
Elmdale Moto Lodge just won "Best Motel Suite".
Coincidentally, the Hospies Committee just had their retreat there last fall.
I'm not saying something's up, but uh - Okay - Emcee: Our next award So, what are you doing after this?
Oh, well, I happen to have a king suite at the Elmdale Moto Lodge in exchange for presenting an award today, so Well, I did pack a bag.
Oh my.
Just thought I'd tag along with you for a few days, you know, tour the best and brightest in dusty roadside accommodations.
Oh!
I will be traveling with royalty, after all.
- Johnny: Getting close, - Stevie.
Stay calm!
Wait, I'm sorry, I-I'm not sure if we're still joking around.
Well, I took Monday off, and I know you have a few more motels to hit, so Oh!
Yeah no, that would be fine.
That would be fine?
That's the kind of reaction you want.
No, I'm sorry, sorry, I just, I you just caught me a little off guard.
I just wanna make sure that we're still - on the same page here.
- Yeah, totally.
Yeah good, good, okay.
'cause you know, I thought this was just something great that happened when it happened.
- It is.
- Stevie!
I mean, you know, I'm on the road so much, and you've got the motel to run, I don't see any of that changing any time soon.
Okay.
But what if it could change?
I'm sorry, I-I don't see that happening for either of us.
Oh.
Emcee: The winner is Rosebud Motel.
Oh!
Yessssss!
Stevie, we did it!
Oh my God!
Ohhhh!
Stevie!
Look at her, she's stunned!
Um - Hey!
- Hey!
You're home.
I was just gonna leave you that little note and a box of chocolates.
I got the part, didn't I?
Come in, come in!
Ohhh Yay!
Nom nom!
I now see that there are different ways to interpret chocolates.
Alexis, I just wanted to say Moira: Am I hearing Jocelyn?
Yeah, she's come to tell me the good news!
Oh, did she?
Chocolates?
Are we celebrating, Jocelyn?
The chocolates were a mistake.
Alexis, after very careful consideration, I've decided that you are overqualified for the role.
I know, but I'm totally fine with that.
And I really value you as our in-house publicist.
Jocelyn, no.
Oh, we can see where this is going.
Part of me thinks that maybe we should give the role to somebody who really needs it.
Oh Alexis, I wanted to fight for you, but I had to recuse myself as your Mummy!
Okay, um Who did you pick?
We're still looking.
So you picked no one over me?
That would be a Jocelyn question.
Maybe there's a better role for you.
What's better than the lead?
Yes, I'm curious about that as well.
Kit Kat Club Dancer Number Six!
- Hah!
- Sorry?
She doesn't have a lot of lines, but she has a very sexy costume, and a lot of face time on stage, - which I know that you love - I love both of those things.
Okay, um would that require like, another audition?
No, no!
No, the part is yours.
Jocelyn, how wonderfully generous of us.
Okay.
Well, I'm guess I'll have to put you in touch with my agent.
But I think you already have her number.
And we'll get going on negotiations!
I would have my agent accept that offer, dear.
Yes.
Thank you.
Woo!
How 'bout that, partner, huh?
Not bad for a couple of years' work.
Hey trust me, I'm just as shocked as you are.
But this is ours, and no one can take it from us.
Sorry, Sir, uh, I'm gonna need to take that for the next category.
We'll be mailing yours in six to eight weeks, along with the bill.
Okay, great.
Yeah, okay.
Well, that's probably for the best, I mean, I don't wanna be lugging that thing around - to all the after-parties.
- Mhmm.
So, Stevie, I thought we'd go for a celebratory dinner, huh?
Yeah.
Unless that steps on your plans with Emir?
Nope, there's no more plans anymore, so, whatever you wanna do.
Your weekend plans got pushed, or ?
Uh no, just canceled.
It was a stupid idea anyways.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Okay, well, you know what, if it's okay with you, why don't we beat the traffic, and just just head home, 'cause I gotta be honest, I'm I'm feeling awfully tired, actually.
Mr. Rose, I know how important this is to you.
Oh Stevie, we got what we came for.
Well, we didn't actually get it, they took it back.
I mean, what kind of cheap-ass award show takes back an award?
!
Mr. Rose, I don't think I can go back out there.
Well, tell you what, you stay here, I'll grab your bag, and maybe a few shrimp for the road?
Yeah, thanks.
Patrick: I don't regret what I did.
Well, look who it is.
Ronnie, we want to apologize for the miscommunication this afternoon.
We?
What's that?
This is just a, an expression of our continued appreciation.
I don't see any of that blue cheese in here.
David, did you put any of the blue cheese in there for Ronnie?
That cheese was very expensive.
We'd be happy to run some over.
So what would be the update on the tiles, then?
Funny you should ask.
I was just heading out to run them over.
- Ah!
- Hmm.
So I wonder if you still need the basket, then.
Oh, I still need the basket.
So uh, does this mean that the whole project could be wrapped up then, by tonight?
Did I just say that I was heading out right now?
- Yes, she did!
- She did, great.
Uh so, should we just jump in with you?
I don't think so.
What about just me then, Ronnie?
This went well I think.
Yeah.
Well, hello, you!
Mrs. Rose, what are you doing here?
I thought you and I might celebrate your big award!
Come in.
Oh, thank you.
And I was made aware there was a loss, as well.
Yeah.
Turns out, someone who's been working the front desk of a motel her whole life isn't exactly a turn-on.
I was speaking of his loss.
Stevie, underneath the brambly tartan blousant is a chrysalis, just bursting with potential.
Well, I'm glad somebody thinks so.
Yes, perhaps she just needs a bit of a shock to her daily routine.
That's kind of what I was going for, Mrs. Rose.
Well, the kind of shock I'm referring to, Stevie, will not come in the form of a man.
What is this?
Oh, just a gift that once jolted me out of my little Podunk routine.
Me, in front of people?
I am not an actor.
And neither is the lead in the play.
She's simply a headstrong young woman, who's been knocked about a few times, and looking to make the most of herself.
Did Mr. Rose put you up to this?
No, this inspired piece of stunt-casting was an idea all my own.
And we can't find anyone else.
- Thank you - You're welcome.
I should've led with this.
Please tell me you can sing.
I sing in the car.
Good enough.
Okay.
Peruse.
At your leisure.
Okay.
Oh, I see you've opened a bottle of wine already, I won't burden you with another.
Bye.
Bye.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Is today the baseball day?
Today was supposed to be the baseball day, yes.
- The finale?
- Championship.
Same thing.
What time did you need me to show up to watch you play the baseball?
Well, as of right now, there you might not be anything - for you to watch.
- Oh?
Gwen dropped out.
Apparently she has to go see a friend she met on the internet, so we are missing a right fielder.
Can you play both parts?
Positions.
And, no.
That's the whole problem.
We will forfeit the game if we can't come up with a ninth player.
Well on the upside, there is an Isabelle Huppert double feature playing at the Elmdale Art House.
David, I can't bail on the game, I just have to find a ninth player.
Okay, well, good luck.
It sounds a bit last minute.
You know, they don't even have to do anything, they pretty much just stand there.
Have you asked Ronnie?
Uh, she is on the other team, and I'm pretty sure she hates me after the bathroom incident.
Oh, I forgot about that.
Hey, you know what, David, since you were already planning on being there, maybe-maybe you Absolutely not!
- Just two hours of your life.
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
- We just need a body!
- Then go to the morgue.
I will cover you if any flies come your way.
I have a spray for that.
And you know my stance on team sports.
I do.
Given today's political climate, we don't need to divide ourselves any more - than we already have.
- Correct.
Have I mentioned to you that there will be a barbecue after?
I have a couple questions.
How many of the questions are about the barbecue?
Most of them.
Like, how soon after the game is the barbecue, and will the players get to eat first, and if so, who's enforcing that rule?
- I love you, David.
- Okay.
I - you say that now, but - Mm muah!
I don't do well with running.
All right.
Ronnie, I don't know what the big deal is!
Nobody's gonna even notice that Stevie's not at the game.
That's not the problem, Roland.
I gotta be honest, sometimes I don't even notice her when she's standing right in front of me.
Roland, the rules say that we can't play if we don't have nine players!
And I can't stomach the thought of Patrick's team winning by default; the man looks like a thumb!
Ooh, Ronnie!
I'm gonna need you to pour a little of that picante sauce on the game today.
Because my bookie, Lorenzo, gave me great odds on us taking this.
There is not going to be a game - if we don't have a full team!
- Um, excuse me?
I used to play a little ball in my day.
I was the star left fielder from my school team.
You played college ball?
No, Hebrew school.
There were seven of us, surprisingly, not a big turn-out, but uh, the Flying Latkes ended up in fourth place.
Johnny, I think some things have changed since played ball, okay?
For one thing, the war is over.
Ohhh!
Well, excuse me, I thought you were in a bind, and needed a player, but uh, forget it, I'm taking my offer back.
Roland, he's our only option.
No, he's not!
Joce has a CPR dummy that we can just throw - out into left field.
- Roland!
- We're going with Johnny!
- Ah, boy.
Great!
And just so you know, I had a pretty strong arm in the outfield.
The Rabbi used to call me "Popeye".
Okay I am gonna give Lorenzo a call, and change my bet.
I'm gonna put everything I got on the other team.
Hi Honey, is your Daddy home?
This is so exciting!
I've never been in a musical before.
Although I did have a cousin who was in "Riverdance" until she got trampled.
Yeah, um, I was one of the original Pussycat Dolls, But I only lasted like, two weeks.
Because apparently, I'm "too pretty".
This is gonna be such a fun day!
Woman: Hey, Twyla!
What about you, Stevie?
I didn't even know that you wanted to be an actor.
- I don't.
- Fine, "artist".
I've been dreading this rehearsal for the past two days.
Okay, as star of the show, you might wanna set like, a different tone for everyone.
I think this is a huge mistake.
You're not wrong.
There has been a lot of confusion as to why I'm not the star of the show, but fair is fair.
You earned it.
- No, I didn't.
I didn't audition.
I don't like attention.
I can't think of anything worse than standing on a stage in front of a room full of people.
Okay, Stevie, I think you just need to chill.
If this is anything like my first day with the Pussycat Dolls, it'll be a couple of hours of Kegels, and then an afternoon of cheeky Bellinis.
It's just a lot of pressure.
Don't even worry about it.
I got your back today, girl.
Just like Nicole Scherzinger did for me.
Willkommen and bienvenue, welcome, you to "Cabaret"!
-  - Not now, not yet.
Okay, mhmm.
I'm sure this will come as a shock to all of you, but this production will mark my directorial debut!
Mmm - Oh.
-  Missing cues already.
No, I'm-I'm simply here to inspire.
And instruct, and bring out the very best in you.
And I want to start the day with my lupanarian Kit Kat Girls!
We've also included anyone who's requested extra rehearsal time to work on their dance moves.
I just wanna limber up.
There's some pretty tricky footwork, so First, everyone, please, direct your gaze to the beating heart of our show, our Sally Bowles, Miss Stevie - Budd.
- Budd!
You're wondering, are we really going to lay this colossal enterprise upon her tiny shoulders?
Yes!
I'm a 100% confident that you will all soon see what I hope I believe I may be seeing in you, Stevie.
Thank you.
As long as you're up, why don't we jump right in?
You can help me lead the first exercise.
Uh, I thought this more of a meet and greet kind of thing.
It's the afternoon upon which your bodies will meet and greet - the boards.
-  Okay, this is called "Monster on my Back".
Oh, fuck.
Wow Okay, just so you're aware, I had a very cute, "my boyfriend's on the baseball team" spectator look prepared for today, and now I'm wearing tap shoes.
They're called cleats, and I think you look very cute.
That's a given.
This just isn't how I pictured being a placeholder rolling out.
Here.
I thought we could head outside, maybe throw the ball around a little bit?
This glove is brown.
My shoes are black.
What exactly are we doing here?
- We're gonna practice?
- Practice what?
!
You told me I was just a body in a field!
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hey, Mr. Rose.
- Whoa!
- What are you doing?
!
Well, what are you doing?
Patrick's forcing me to be on his team - for the game today.
- Yeah.
Well, Roland and Ronnie wanted me to be on their team - for the game today.
- Oh my God!
That's funny, 'cause Ronnie's been telling me all week how stacked her team is!
So yeah, so this makes sense.
Oh.
Well, David, I'm surprised to see you back in a uniform.
Whoa, I'm sorry, "back" in a uniform?
Okay, we don't need to get into it.
He didn't tell you?
Well, David holds the Little League record for most times hit by a ball.
That's assuming it wasn't intentional.
They let me go home early.
So where are you putting him?
Right field.
Okay, well, I'll try and get everyone to pull the ball to the left.
Well, thank you, Mr. Rose, but we're trying to keep morale high.
David and I are actually just going outside to throw the ball around.
Well, that sounds like fun.
I think I'll oil up the glove and join you.
Ew!
Please don't.
Oh David, don't worry, you'll be great.
I just wish I'd kept that helmet I got you.
Does this come in black?
You can use mine.
Twyla: Once Once.
Uh no, we've moved on from the mirror exercise.
Oh, okay, sorry.
Go ahead.
Once At the motel One word at a time.
Okay.
Once Uh sorry, I'm not good at this, I'm just not good at this, so.
Okay, um, maybe someone else should jump in at this point.
Excellent idea, Alexis.
Okay, I'll play with Stevie.
And perhaps we'll get a clearer idea of what we need here.
Maybe you could do it with somebody else though, let somebody else try.
First word is a gimme.
So you may say "once".
- Once - Upon A - Nightmare - My - Captor - Was Dismembering Okay, does it always get so dark?
Oh, I'm, I'm just flowing with your energy, Stevie.
Which is good, but you may require a little scordatura.
Why don't I break us up into groups.
That's a good idea, 'cause it's better than what's happening here.
I'm glad you agree.
- I'll I'll number us off!
- Um, one, two.
One, two.
Two.
Two two, two.
Jocelyn, take group two for some movement exercises.
- Mhmm.
- Thank you.
And you and I will do a little more one on one.
Okay, hey!
Do you think we could maybe switch parts at this point?
Um, at this point I really wouldn't want to.
But if it makes you feel better, I think lunch is soon.
Um, I'm just wondering when the Bellinis are coming out?
Stay strong, babe.
Alexis, we don't need to exercise our movement?
Come here.
- You ready?
- Uh, yeah.
Okay, next time, can you make sure the ball goes into my glove?
Thanks so much.
It's a ground ball, David.
So in a game situation, it is possible that the ball won't be hit directly into your glove.
How's it going, boys?
Do you mind if I toss a few?
That'd be great, Mr. Rose.
That way I won't be the only one chasing the ball every time I miss David's glove.
Okay, the last thing I need right now are two people coaching me on something I didn't wanna do in the first place.
Well, it's more for me, David.
Popeye's arm isn't what it used to be.
Nobody's gonna call you Popeye.
Look alive, Patrick!
Roland: Whoa, hold it.
Uh, Johnny?
What are we doing here?
Just tossing the ball around, Roland.
- No big deal.
- Wait, David's your sub?
I thought you told me that your team was stacked!
- Good to see you too, Ronnie.
- Yeah Dave, be honest with me.
Are you just playing to make your dad look good?
I may have to call my bookie again, right?
Okay, this is passive harassment.
Anyway, we just stopped by to say we're having a little pre-game bevvy and pep talk at my place if you want to join us, Johnny.
Well, I think I'll just stick around, and loosen up a bit, Ronnie.
Johnny, I don't think it's really ethical for you to be doing spring training with the enemy.
He's not the enemy, Roland.
He's my son.
There are no sons in baseball!
What?
I'd argue most baseball players are somebody's son.
- So what does that make me?
!
- Ohhhh!
No but, just 'cause he, he said there's Yeah, you know what, good luck.
'Cause you all are gonna need it.
Yeah, I'm looking at you.
Roland: Yeah.
Wow, she is really not a fan.
Ohh man, I wanna win this game.
Okay, you told me it was just for fun, though!
Well, it is for fun, David, but a little rivalry is part of the fun.
It's like when we used to play the Catholic kids from Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow.
The worst school cheer I ever heard.
All: Blaaah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Let's be aware!
There are two groups in the room, voices carry.
Okay.
But this is actually a good distraction for you.
Because when you're on stage, you're going to have to drown it all out.
Okay, so let's now focus on the image you were about to conjure for me.
Okay I'm in the Town Hall.
I'm wearing my maroon plaid hoodie.
And I'm feeling very uncomfortable.
Hmm, vivid.
Visceral.
Excellent, Stevie.
Although the exercise does ask us to recall a traumatic event in our life.
This sounds almost as if you're describing what's happening right now.
- Well, I am.
-  Oop!
There's that razor sharp wit that landed you the role.
Ah, Moira.
Group two is gonna take a fiver.
I have not had this much exercise since I birthed Roland Jr. Look at you, Jocelyn!
Pushing your authority as assistant director to its limit.
But Stevie and I are still doing some memory sculpting.
Uh, Mrs. Rose, I think I could really use - a five minute break.
- Oh, Stevie.
Okay, but we've chatted 30 seconds already, so we'll call it a company four-and-a-half.
Okay.
Okay  - Hey.
- Hey.
So before I take my five, which technically won't start until after this conversation, I just wanted to have a conversation with you.
It's about Stevie.
Oh Alexis, I can't say I didn't see this coming.
This must be very difficult for you, watching one of your contemporaries step in as Sally, when you fought so hard for the role.
Oh my God, no!
I read the script, and never would've been able to memorize those lines.
May I ask where your concern lies, then?
This is all a little intense.
- Hmm?
- Especially for Stevie.
If anything I'm going easy on her.
You should've seen the conditioning Rocky put me through.
Our first day consisted of mud runs, - and sob therapy!
- Okay.
Well, she's not you, and I think she's actually regretting signing up for this.
And feels like it was a big mistake.
Really?
What gave you that impression?
Because she told me that she regrets signing up for this, and feels like it was a big mistake.
That kind of attitude's not going to get her very far as an actress.
Well, she's clearly not an actress.
You told us this morning that you were here to inspire, instruct, and bring out the best in all of us.
If only we needed to fill the role of a Dictaphone!
- I'm just saying.
- And your point is made.
Thank you.
Whatever's left of the five minutes might do us all some good.
Thank you.
Patrick: All right now, two away!
All right, players to first and second!
Outfield in a little bit, two away now, let's go!
Okay, I don't know who this is, but can we put him back in the box?
Johnny: David, keep your glove up!
Protect your face!
Roland: Hey, Johnny!
No coaching.
Always be ready!
Ugh!
Johnny, why don't you just put on a little apron, and serve them the win on a silver platter?
!
I'm just helping out my son, Roland.
The kid has no idea what he's doing!
I can hear you!
Okay, uh, Ronnie, hit one out to right field.
There's basically nobody out there, Nobody's gonna catch it, go ahead.
Roland: You got this, you got it!
- Roland: Ohhh!
- Johnny: You can do it, David!
Patrick: Get out of the way, David!
-  - It's okay, David, I got it.
Hey, you know what?
!
It's not okay.
I'm doing you the favour, you told me I was just a body in a field, not a body that had to catch things, flying very fast in the air!
So I'm out!
Well, actually, David, uh, Ronnie's out, and the inning's over, and technically, you're walking in the right direction.
Well, that's good for you, then, please get my glove.
- Knock, knock!
- Team?
Um, a firefighter with back pain?
No, try again.
Knock, knock!
A vacuum salesman?
I don't know.
Bob, try to communicate what's written on the paper.
Is-is there a bell I could ring?
You know, I don't, I don't wanna be rude, but uh, they could be having dinner.
Um, you know, just keep knocking until someone guesses what, or who you are.
Help me out here.
Knock, knock.
Yes, let's you and I sit this one out, shall we?
End things on a lighter note.
It is called a "play", not a "work".
Jocelyn: Someone caught in the rain!
Um, Mrs. Rose?
I've been thinking Oh, that's your first mistake.
Don't think, Stevie, just trust your instincts.
Okay well, my instincts are telling me that I'm in over my head.
See, deciphering which instincts to trust that's the real skill.
- You're feeling overwhelmed.
-  After some quiet reflection, it occurred to me that this morning's exercises might've been a bit advanced.
Please remember, this is all new to me as well.
Alexis: Ooh!
A guy that works with animals, but not a vet -  - We're in this together.
Okay Might I share with you an anecdote about my director - A man with amnesia!
- Yes!
Well, he may have a story or two about that from his later years.
No, sorry, I mean, the game.
It-he's a man with amnesia!
Yes!
Oh, I'm so glad somebody figured it out!
Oh, I actually forgot what I was supposed to do up here!
- Jocelyn:  - Ohh!
You know that you have to come up and play the game now, right?
I think I can handle that.
- Ohhh - Thanks.
Vampire person!
Twyla: Oh!
Ghost!
Ghost girl!
Hemophiliac!
Woman with amnesia!
No!
Hey!
Patrick.
I don't mean to put any pressure on you, but you do realize that it's the bottom of the ninth, two out, bases are loaded, and the game's on the line, right?
Yeah, I realize that, thank you, Ronnie.
So, who's up?
Oh, I think you know who's up.
The barbecue guy wasn't ready, but he gave me some chips.
Okay David, you're up, but I'm gonna talk to the ump and see if we can pinch hit for you.
Why?
It's the only part of this stupid game that I'm actually good at.
Well, you struck out three times, so I tipped it that one time, you even admitted that!
No, that's true, and that was a-that was a great tip.
It's just that we're trying to win here.
Hey!
Hey!
Do we have a batter, or what?
!
- What's going on?
- Yeah, I'm doing it.
- I'm doing the batting.
- Ohhh, okay, great!
- All right!
- Okay.
Easy out everyone, easy out!
Fire up the grill, we'll be there in a couple of seconds!
Okay, everyone shut up!
Ronnie, throw the thing.
-  - Unh!
Patrick: Oh my God!
Run, David, run!
- Way to go, son!
- Patrick: All right, David!
Roland: Johnny!
Get the ball!
Patrick: This is it!
Go, David!
Drop the bat!
Ronnie: What are you waiting for, Johnny?
Roland: Come on, he's going home!
Patrick: All the way, David!
All the way!
-  - Aaaah!
- Umpire: Safe!
- Green Team: Yeaaaaah!
- Are you okay?
- Did I do it?
You did it.
You did it!
-  - Wooo!
Woo!
- Johnny:  -  Patrick: David Rose, hit the ball!
Ohhh!
- Wooooo!
- Woo!
That's my boy!
You know, Johnny, the next time I need a sub, remind me to ask the blind goat over at Mrs. Divine's farm.
It's just a game, Roland.
Popeye smokes his son square in the back.
It was a quick recovery, Ronnie, but thanks for the play-by-play.
Well, luckily for me, I had a side bet on whether Johnny would throw the game in his kid's favour.
I consider it a split.
When you get hit in the back playing a game you never wanted to play in the first place, does that make you the VIP?
The MVP, and uh, no, we're not doing that.
Okay, what if we were doing it, though?
Well then, you would definitely be the VIP.
Okay.
Listen, I'm sorry if this game sorta unleashed my competitive side.
Yeah, we really don't need to meet him again.
But, you know, part of me wonders, would you have hit a home run if I hadn't lit that fire in you?
Because I have never seen you run like that.
Yeah, it was mainly because I was smelling the barbeque.
- Ah.
- Up.
Higher.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 I don't know why I'm feeling this like deep, aching sense of dread.
David, I'm more than capable of looking after your store while you and Stevie work the flea market.
Why did Patrick have to book today of all days for his tax seminar?
Like who voluntarily goes to a tax seminar?
Maybe the kinds of people who want to keep their businesses?
Okay, hi.
You are literally only here to receive a package.
So I cannot have you distracted your phone unless there's an emergency.
And then immediately call Call Patrick.
I know!
No!
Patrick is at the tax seminar!
Are you hearing anything I'm saying?
!
Yes.
Stay off your phone.
Wait for the delivery man to drop off whatever.
You can trust me.
Okay, can I?
Because the last time I left you in charge of something Ugh!
This is about those stupid Tamagotchi?
- Actually it is.
- Okay guys You left me with six of them, David.
Taking care of that many is like a full-time job!
I left you with six adult Tamagotchis in perfect health!
And by the time I came home, they were all dead.
You have to like actively murder them - in order for that to happen!
- Okay, David, um, as much as I love carrying out all these boxes by myself, I think she's going to be okay, so maybe you could give me a hand?
How did David con you into this anyway?
It gives me an excuse to take a break from rehearsals with your mom for a day?
Um, last night she texted me at 3 A.M. and all it said was "leggings".
- Hmm - We have to go.
Um, you're welcome, by the way, David.
Who knows, maybe after today you'll finally stop talking about Tamagotchi.
Unlikely murderer.
Unfortunately for everyone, John, Stevie turned out to be quite the find.
She'll need a lot of direction obviously, but you know, ballet intensive, perhaps some mittens to curb the nail biting.
Moira, I love the way you pour yourself into your projects.
But the whole point of this spa trip was to take a breather from cabaret.
Yes John.
I promise to enjoy the 60 minutes I'll spend having my deepest tissues palpated.
Then a few sips of cucumber water.
Factor in five minutes for you to use the facilities and we'll be back home by noon.
And we're not rushing through this, Moira.
We've got an entire day of treatments ahead of us.
Today is for slowing down, and getting reacquainted with our bodies.
Okay, just please give me a moment to make a decision on this chaise lounge.
Oh, put the phone down, Moira.
Whatever it is can wait.
It's for Fraulein Schneider's Salon.
Do you prefer the olive suede to the Merlot?
Similar texture but falls apart in emotional complexity.
I can't look right now, Moira.
I'm driving.
All right.
I'll hold it up for you.
No, Moira, I can't right now.
It's just a quick glance, John!
All right, then you need to hold it straighter.
-  - That oh-oh, what was that?
- A tiny speed bump.
- Speed bump?
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Why would there be a speed bump?
No, I think I, I think I hit an animal.
Oh, it's the circle of life, John.
You've just provided a nice Passover Seder for a family of hawks.
No ew   John, don't get too close, dear.
We can't afford you contracting mange.
It's a cat, Moira.
I hit a cat!
Well, what kind of ailurophobe sends their kitty out to play on such a busy stretch of highway?
It's got a collar!
This is someone's pet.
There's a farmhouse right there, probably belongs to them.
Or not.
Okay, so this is really good, we just need everything facing forward.
Facing forward.
Facing forward.
See what I'm doing here?
Stevie: Okay, like a serial killer?
-  - David Rose!
- Oh God!
- Would you look at that?
If this isn't a full circle moment, - then I'm not twice divorced.
- My God, Wendy!
This must be your wife.
- No.
- God, no.
No, no, Wendy, this is my friend, Stevie.
Stevie, this is Wendy.
Wendy used to employ me at the Blouse Barn.
I'm so sorry, I don't mean to jump to conclusions.
I guess I've got marriage on the brain again.
If you can believe it, I'm engaged!
- Hmm, wow.
- Congratulations.
Well, you know what they say about love, it's like target practice, if you just keep shooting at it Anyway, David, I was hoping you would have settled down by now!
Oh, I actually own this business with my partner.
Get outta town!
I know, I am as shocked as you are.
Well, I guess that makes us flea buddies.
I've got my own booth.
Wow, so we're reopening the Blouse Barn?
Oh, no, no, no, just test driving a new business idea, brought to me by my new partner, Antonio.
Antonio!
What are you doing?
Come over here, so I can show you off!
Hey.
Well, Antonio, say hi to everyone.
-  Hi.
- You look very familiar.
Have I seen you in my store before?
I don't think so.
Okay.
He seems sweet.
He reminds me a lot of you.
Well, isn't that a compliment.
For him.
I better get back and help Tony set up the booth.
It was such a treat seeing you, David!
And you, Karen!
Karen's a new one.
I have definitely seen that guy in my store before.
Do you think that Wendy knows her fiancÃ© has been checking out every guy in here?
She has the worst taste in men.
At one point, she told me she was looking for a Jon Gosselin type.
Sorry, we're closed.
Very funny.
Ugh, I was hoping you were the delivery guy.
- Thanks.
- No, I'm just like, so bored.
Well, I am not the delivery guy, but I come bearing gifts.
But I didn't pay for that.
I know, I got it at the flea market.
Thank you for the delivery.
Do you need my signature?
Oops.
Oh wow!
Uh um, miss, seems that the strap has fallen off of your shoulder.
I'd offer to put it back for you, but as a delivery guy, I don't know if it's my place.
Oh, how respectful.
Now, if only you had that much respect for my time.
I've been waiting here forever.
Um, sorry that I'm late my grandmother passed this morning.
Ew!
Oh my God, Ted!
Sorry, I wasn't prepared for an improv.
No, it's fine, it's fine.
Okay, what else weren't you prepared for?
- The import taxes?
- Hmm Okay, obviously I'm not good at this, can we just skip to the good part?
Yes.
Okay.
So, you and I just innocently witnessed an 18-wheeler barreling down Moira, I'm just gonna be honest, all right?
There was an accident, it was tragic, unavoidable, and then we'll be on our way.
- Mm-Kay.
-   Can I help you?
What beautiful day, isn't it?
- Crops need rain.
- Yes, yes.
Oh, as they often do.
Um well, we just had an unfortunate thing My husband struck down your feline with our car.
Well, we don't necessarily know whether the cat belongs to this uh, gentleman.
Well, what did it look like?
The name on the tags was "Sergio"?
-  - Well, that was him.
Oh, these city people driving too damn fast up and down this road.
No, I-I don't think speed was-was the thing here.
No, my husband has what's called a feather foot.
Well then, why did you stop?
We thought it was the decent thing to do.
Um, now that's done, and we have a very pressing engagement so.
Well, my wife is so right, we're running very late right now.
The Hammam Spas are notoriously fickle about refunds.
You're going to the spa?
Well, that does sound important, but since you just killed my daughter's cat, coming inside to break the news to her might be a little bit more important.
Don't you think?
Hm, John, shall I pick you up on the way back?
I know how desperate you were for me to have my day of detox.
No!
No, Moira!
I think it's better if you come inside with me, so we can uh, break the news together.
David: Okay, this is the last of them, unless you wanted me to bring in the 14 coffee cups and 3 empty chip bags that are also in your back seat?
Mhmm.
David, remember when you thought Wendy's partner had been in your store before?
He has been in my store before.
Well, I think I know why he wasn't being so upfront about it.
Okay, I know what you're gonna say, and I also thought that he was into me for a second, but I'm pretty sure that's just his face.
No.
Look over at their booth, and tell me you don't notice any similarities.
- What the actual fuck?
!
- I know.
- They've ripped off our entire store.
- Yeah.
Tulips instead of roses?
Woof!
Similar products.
The labels even look like ours.
Except, their stuff's half price.
What?
Well, we have a very loyal customer base who would not be fooled by some skanky knockoff.
Okay, Dave, I'm ready to check out here.
Roland!
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at the motel!
I'm on my coffee break, and I ran out of foot cream.
- Those are 3 for 15, yes?
- These are not from our store.
Well, what are you talking about?
I just got 'em off your table over there.
That's not our table.
Well then, why were you standing there?
That's not me!
And he's still standing there!
Okay um, do you want the sale, or not?
Uh no, you can buy our superior foot cream at a slightly higher price.
Geez.
You were a lot nicer when I was talking to you over there.
How far do you think we'd get if we just started running?
When might we expect your daughter to show up, because we do have a very busy day ahead of us?
-  - Well, baby's still sleeping, but if you wanna go and wake her up, tell her what happened, by all means.
Where is Bebe's chamber?
Oh, there she is now.
She's either up, or takin' a leak.
Either way, great progress for Bebe.
Here she is.
What's all this?
Who are you?
Uh, hi, Johnny Rose, Baby.
- This is my uh - Sergio's dead!
Ugh.
What the hell?
Yes, it seems he had taken ill, and stumbled out on the road poor thing, presumably to end it all.
And then?
And then we ran over him.
Anyway, this feels like a very private family moment that we're more than willing to share.
That's for you.
Clearly that brand loyalty you were talking about is really paying off.
Like to pay you off to not be here anymore.
Roland, what are you still doing here?
This will only take a second.
Dave, I don't know if you remember or not, but I purchased some foot cream from you earlier?
That wasn't our foot cream.
Yeah, okay, well you took my 15 bucks, and now I'd like a refund, because I realized I've used this stuff before, - and it makes my feet stink.
- Give me that.
Ugh!
It smells like pennies and burps!
Oh yeah!
Wait, that smells exactly like the stuff we used to use at the motel.
- Ugh.
- Like, exactly.
Wait a second   That's why!
Gel Time Moist Liquid.
-  - Contains 100% moist liquid.
- Uh - oh, Davey got busted!
Okay, this is not our product, Roland!
Anyone who sells counterfeit luxury beauty products is clearly a sociopath.
Dave, I don't wanna tell you how to run your business, but 3 or 15 dollars for Gel Time is a total rip-off.
I mean, pharmacies hand those out for free on Halloween.
David, you have to talk to Wendy.
David: Okay, what am I gonna tell her?
That her curious life partner, who looks nothing like me, is some big old con artist?
$18 for toner?
Why don't you just on some Gel Time?
That stuff will strip your skin right off.
Ooh.
Whoa!
That was I know, like are good, but that was like You pulled some new tricks out.
New to you.
Anyway, David should leave you in charge of the store more often.
Um Ted, the door was unlocked the entire time!
What?
Someone could've like, walked in on us.
They would've gotten quite the show!
It's very irresponsible and dangerous of us.
Well, now we know for next time.
Oh, um, I almost forgot, I never signed for that parcel.
Uh, I don't think the guy showed up?
No, Ted Oh uh oh, yeah I I'd get your signature, but I guess I left my clipboard and scanner thing somewhere, so.
Do you think it might be in David's new bathroom?
Apparently it's just for customers, but he never lets anyone use it.
I remember now, I definitely left my scanner thing in there.
- Mhm let's go - let's go find your scanner thing.
Can I just request we actually drop the scanner thing bit just 'cause it's kinda throwing me off.
Yeah, okay.
Oh, this is nice!
- Uh - Oh!
Is that a sink?
Oh!
A sink it is!
Alexis: Help me up, babe.
- Ted: Oh my God!
- Alexis: Fuck!
Ugh!
How are we still trapped in this Gothic horror show?
You know, I think we've already missed the seaweed wrap, and at this rate, it's not looking good for the salt scrub.
You know, I wish there was something else we could do here, but uh, I really feel we've overstayed our welcome.
Yes, we should really hit the road.
In that big, fancy car of yours?
Oh it's it's big, but it's not that fancy.
Listen folks, we don't want much, but you should cover the expenses of the funeral.
The funeral for your cat?
Well, it was Baby's only cat.
Perhaps it's the lack of air, but I believe I saw three or four cats running around since this interrogation began.
It was my only tabby.
Okay, well maybe there's something we can do.
Does Bebe enjoy the theater?
Hmm?
How about two complimentary, partially-obstructed view seats to Cabaret?
No!
She likes the Kinky Shoes.
You got tickets to Kinky Shoes?
I believe it's Kinky Boots.
And no.
John: Well, maybe a professional massage might help ease Baby's pain.
I like massages.
So, now you're taking Bebe to the spa?
No, I wouldn't be taking her Moira, but maybe Baby can take her uh, grandmother.
- I'm her mother!
- Yes, well that Yes, you are!
And you are going to adore the rejuvenating facial peel.
Can I keep the slippers?
This is my favourite after shave.
Wendy: This is for you.
- Go!
- Okay.
- Wendy: On my feet -  - Hi.
- Wendy, hi!
David!
Isn't this great?
The two of us, back together!
Successful in business!
Successful in love.
- Mhmm, totally.
- Quick question for you, Wen You know, when Antonio came to me with this idea, I wasn't sure there was a market for another general store.
Everyone is doing them now.
Yeah, I was one of the first, but I get it.
And they sell all the same stuff.
I'm sure you've noticed a similarity - between our products and yours.
- Sure did.
Wendy can I speak with you for a moment?
Sure.
Why don't we go over to your booth?
It's so much quieter.
Okay.
Um, I don't wanna be the one to have to tell you this, but it's about your fiancÃ© You know Brad?
- Who's Brad?
- My fiance.
I thought you and Antonio were Oh David  We're business partners.
Oh!
Okay.
Well, that's gonna make this a little easier.
Turns out Antonio is a common criminal.
- What?
- Stevie give me the Look at this, please.
100% moist liquid?
Antonio said it was locally sourced.
Sure.
If you consider the dollar store local.
These sell for 99 cents.
Well, he's been charging me way more!
I'm so sorry, you had to hear this.
No, David, I'm glad you told me.
I was gonna go into business with this person.
And I'm ashamed to say, in my weaker moments, I've been tempted to cheat on poor, sweet Brad.
With Antonio?
Well, obviously you picked up on the intense heat between us - if you thought we were a couple.
- Yeah.
Wendy, for several reasons I think you need to say goodbye to Antonio.
Ugh.
How I'm gonna tell Brad.
He and Antonio are roommates.
They share this tiny one-bedroom together.
And it is so crowded in there, they had to put the mirror on the ceiling.
Yeah.
Best to shut all that down, I think.
David, what would I do without you?
I literally don't know, Wendy.
You wanna get high?
- No, but thank you.
- Okay.
Okay.
So, the delivery man came in, used the bathroom, somehow broke the sink, and then left without delivering the package.
That is correct.
I just find it strange that he would then leave a note saying, "sorry I missed you".
Yeah.
No I think he meant, like, sorry I missed you.
Because I was here the entire time.
And I actually think that he was like a little bit drunk, because he knocked over a lot of things.
And you were here for this?
Um, no Well, you were here for part of it.
Right.
But I got here late my grandmother passed away.
- Oh God!
- A few years ago.
And it just been real tough to get over.
Mhmm.
Well, fortunately we had these security cameras installed, so I guess I'll just show that to the insurance people?
I don't really know how this works, Patrick went to that seminar.
Oh.
Um honestly, I-I don't think that you wanna do that.
You said that I could trust you.
First, the Tamagotchies, now this!
Get out of my store.
Okay, fine.
You can take the money for the sink out of what you were going to pay me for today.
I wasn't planning on paying you anything.
Get out!
You too.
Very disappointed.
And if we're pointing fingers, David, I've done it on a lot of sinks and I've never had an issue.
When you say you've done it on a lot of sinks Out!
- Hmm.
-  Ugh!
I don't wanna touch this.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
1  Okay so, as we all know, I think surprise parties are tacky, and far too often organized by well-intentioned people with very bad taste.
But Patrick has always wanted one, poor thing.
So I am throwing him a surprise party tonight.
Johnny: Well David, these kinds of parties take time, and planning.
Now, when I planned that Casablanca-themed party for your mother's 40th, I had to quarantine the camels for a month.
- Mhmm.
- Yeah David, this is all feeling very sketchy and last minute-y.
I've actually been organizing this for quite some time, I'm just telling you right now because I know that none of you can keep a secret.
Oh!
At 9 a.m. it's a little early for character assassination.
Not one of you knows how the "Crows" movie ends.
You told me the day you got home.
You gave me the script.
And you were both sworn to secrecy, so David is right not to trust you.
Yeah, this is why I'm reluctant to tell you that there is an extra surprise tonight.
I invited Patrick's parents.
Oh my God, David!
Oh, that is very exciting news, son!
Meeting the parents!
That's a big step.
Yes, things are certainly racing along at a dangerously rapid velocity.
Thank you so much, we're doing great.
Now, I will only be throwing one surprise party, and one surprise party only.
So tonight there will be a surprise.
And there will be tears.
Even if they're just my own.
Okay?
How did it end again?
Like, a crowmageddon?
Crowpocalypse.
- But you didn't hear it from me.
-  - So - Wow.
This is a really big deal, Johnny.
I mean, meeting my best friend's son's boyfriend's parents for the very first time, I am very touched that you wanted me to share this moment with you.
I asked you to mow the lawn three times, Roland, So you being here is more your decision than mine.
- Oh!
Clint Hello.
Oh, hi!
- Hi.
- You must be the Brewers.
I'm Clint.
This is my wife, Marci.
What a special moment this is for all of us, huh?
-  - You must be David's Dad.
Oh, no, no!
I do get that all the time, though.
It's uh, you know, you've got David's handsome looks there, and then my face.
Yeah, I'm David's father, Johnny Rose.
Johnny, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.
Now, Patrick tells me you run the motel.
More like, runs it into the ground.
Oh, we do have a lot of fun around here, don't we?
We do, sometimes.
Roland, do you want to get the room key for them?
Sure.
So this is all very exciting.
I assume we'll see you tonight?
Oh you definitely will.
So Patrick has been keeping us up to date about everything he and David have been doing, and I think it's amazing how far they've come.
Yes, yes, yes it is.
But uh, I'll have to admit, I've been somewhat of a skeptic about those two.
This one isn't as progressive as the rest of us.
It's a generational thing with him.
I was talking about the store, Roland.
You know, mixing a business relationship and a romantic relationship, well, that's it can get kinda tricky sometimes.
I-I-I missed the last part of what you just said.
The uh Oh, well, you were aware they were in business together as well, right?
We knew that part, yes.
Really?
Because it kind of seems like the two of you just found out some really shocking information.
Did I speak out of turn?
I-I think we'll just go to the room, and get ready for the big surprise tonight.
Oh, sure.
Huh.
Correct me if I'm wrong here, Johnny.
But it kinda seems like they didn't know their son is in a relationship with David.
You're looking especially fresh and photogenic today, Mother.
Why thank you, Alexis.
Perhaps it's my excellent news.
I found a very promising revenue stream to help finance the little deficit we've accrued - on "Cabaret".
- What might that be?
Well, according to the radio, there's a darling little medical clinic in Elm Grove.
Where if any one of us, say, you, or your father, participates in a few nugatory tests, we could be bringing in over $200 a week!
Or, you could make $2,000 in one afternoon.
Ugh, which test is this?
I'm talking about the soap opera fan convention that's happening today.
I looked at your calendar, so I know that you have the day off.
Working from home.
I already purchased a booth.
Your name is on the website, and I just printed out all of these headshots for you to sign.
Obviously I will be taking commission.
Alexis, there's a good reason I've avoided these conventions in the past.
Showing up, taking your picture with a motley crew of pale, dewy-faced salamander people.
I haven't hit rock bottom quite yet.
It's a matter of self-worth.
You did a commercial for adult diapers!
In Japan!
In full-face Kabuki makeup!
Okay.
As your acting publicist, I'm putting my foot down.
We're doing this.
You need the money, and this is how you're gonna get it.
Look at you.
- Hmm!
- Very well.
But there will be a safe word in case the gaggle of asymmetrical faces gets to be too much.
Deal.
I'll start the car.
Okay, so I told Patrick that there's a salmonella outbreak at the cafe, so he will not be coming here until I tell him to tonight.
Oh.
Is it possible you could maybe choose a lie that doesn't make the cafe look like it's in violation of health codes?
I think it's a pretty good one.
David!
You said you were only gonna be half an hour.
Did you run here, Mr. Rose?
No!
Just a pleasant walk.
Okay, I'm on a site survey for the party.
Why, what's going on?
Well, I-I just checked in "you know who's" parents.
What?
They're not supposed to be here for another 11 minutes!
Well, nothing to worry about.
Um, random question for you.
They're aware that you and Patrick are uh romantically involved, right?
Of course they are.
Why wouldn't they be?
Well, they're definitely aware that you're business partners, it's just that uh, if I recall, at one point Patrick was engaged ahem to a woman, so Okay, what did you say to them?
Nothing, nothing!
It's more how they reacted when I brought up the fact that you two were romantically in business with each other.
Ew!
Yeah, they-they looked a little shaken.
- Shaken?
- Well, upset.
- Upset?
!
- David, they know, right?
Of course they know!
I wouldn't have asked them to come here if I didn't think they knew we were in a relationship!
They call the store all the time!
I mean, what do they think, I'm just his business partner?
!
- Possibly.
- I mean, yeah.
Oh my God!
Okay!
Everybody calm down!
Nobody say a word to anybody!
- Well, that sounds reasonable.
- What did I just say?
!
A few things to expect.
Now, the fans will either want a signed picture, a picture and a handshake, or a picture either of you, or with you.
Well, that's reasonable.
Now, if they ask for pictures of your feet Hailey, you have been more than helpful.
If I might have a moment alone with my daughter?
Slash publicist, thank you.
Alexis dear, now is bad a time as any to tell you.
There is a dark side to Mummy's industry, and I've tried to protect you from it your whole life.
You took me to the Playboy Mansion when I was seven.
And you had a wonderful time in the children's grotto.
But, this!
Alexis, you shouldn't have to see this.
Thespians selling their autographs for money in cheerless convention centers.
- Mhmm.
- Oh God, no!
We have to get out of here, Alexis!
- What's going on?
- That's Gloria Gregson.
Who's Gloria Gregson?
Who's Gloria Gregson?
!
She only played Grace on "Touched With Grace" for 37 years.
The woman has 17 Emmys for playing a hot-headed nurse who healed people with her sexual touch.
I can't have her see me in a place like this!
- Come on!
- Moira?
Mmm!
No, no, it is the Gloria Gregson?
Oh, darling!
Well, look at you, you look gorgeous!
I'm so glad you're here, darling.
I'm usually the only marquee name at these things.
I'm shocked by my presence as well.
And I am Alexis Rose, Moira's publicist and daughter.
Oh!
Daughter?
More like sister.
-  - Ew.
Happy Birthday!
Thank you.
Flowers are for you; the pizza's my lunch.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mm!
So, how's the store?
Thriving.
But more importantly, how are you?
You gotten some calls from some family or friends?
Yeah, I talked to my parents a little while ago.
They're on like, a weekend getaway, so they couldn't chat long, but Did you tell them about dinner?
Uh, they were actually just pulling up to their hotel so they had to jump off but Oh.
Um, speaking of your parents, I've been piecing together that I don't think I ever spoken to them outside of work.
Is that weird?
Okay.
I'm sure you I'm sure you have.
Yeah Like, they know about me, right?
Of course they know about you, what do you mean?
What are you-why?
Like they know about "us", right?
Um Okay listen, David.
I've have been wanting to tell them about us.
I really have, I just was waiting to do it in person, and then I didn't go home for the holidays, and then I was feeling so comfortable with you, - and your family.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I-I don't know why I assumed, um So all this time, your parents thought they were just talking to your your business partner?
Okay.
David, I know my parents are good people, I just  Hmm I can't shake this, this fear that there is a small chance that this could change everything.
That they might see me differently, or treat me differently.
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
But I'm gonna deal with this as soon as I see them next, okay?
Okay, what you're dealing with is very personal.
And something you should only do on your terms.
Okay?
That's why I brought this couple home one day in college, and just told my parents to deal with it.
I'm a take-charge guy, David.
I like to take charge of things in my life, you know that.
Yep, mhmm.
You're upset.
I would be, too.
Yeah.
Uh, it's not about that.
Ahem heh.
You're gonna laugh yourself right out of the closet on this one.
You know how you've always wanted a surprise party?
David, I don't think this is how surprise parties work.
Yeah, I know, it's just part of that surprise was inviting your parents here.
What?
Yeah.
I realize that was a big mistake.
I-I should've talked to you.
I could be just your business partner tonight.
- If that will help.
- No, David.
I, I can't have you do that.
I owe it to us to tell them.
I want them to know.
Yeah, maybe this whole thing is a blessing in disguise, huh?
- It's at the cafe?
- Yeah.
The salmonella was a decoy.
Ooh   Hi, Mrs. Brewer, Mr. Brewer.
I'm I'm David Rose.
Oh, David, come in.
Oh, thank you.
Um I uh, I brought you some things from the store as a welcome present.
We ran out of the body milk, so I threw in some extra lip balms.
Thank you, David.
I just wanted to come here and apologize for a very unfortunate miscommunication.
So you're not in a relationship with our son?
- Oh, no.
I very much am.
- Oh.
Um, I was talking more about how you found out.
Was it something we did, David?
- I'm sorry?
- Honey, stop!
No, I wanna ask.
Do you think if we'd done things differently, - that Patrick would still be - I understand that this news can come as a shock to some people.
But he is still the same person, and it's his birthday, and he David, we're not upset about Patrick being gay.
No.
Oh my God, okay!
For a minute I thought this was gonna get very dark.
Ahem!
The thought that Patrick was feeling like he couldn't come and talk to us about this.
Is it because we were so close with Rachel?
- Hi.
- David.
Oh, hi.
Hi, Clint, Marci.
I see you've met my son.
How are you, David?
Happy, I hope.
Uh, 'cause at the end of the day, that-that's all that matters, isn't it?
Dad, it's fine.
They, they are fine with Patrick being gay.
Oh.
Oh, good.
Good, then no one really has to feel bad about how this information came out, then, huh?
So what do we do now?
Not go to the party?
I don't want to make him uncomfortable.
No, no, no, we are all going to the party.
Patrick is planning on telling you tonight.
So I think the best birthday gift we could give him at this point is to just keep him in the closet until then.
I know that came out wrong, but we all understand what I'm saying, right?
Okay.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Whew!
As actresses we have to do whatever it takes to survive.
Which is why I'm on the convention circuit.
I do dozens a year.
I still can't quite believe that.
Well, can you believe that because of them, I have a vineyard in the south of France?
You may have tried my wine, "Touched With Grapes".
- Oh my God, that's your wine?
- Yes.
We used to use that for sangria, because it was like, so cheap, and so good.
So the fiscal sweetener negates any discomfiture one might feel exploiting their extremities for a $20 bill?
$20?
!
I charge $50.
And just in case, I wear open-toed sandals.
Darling, I used to spend my entire time chasing after parts, worrying about what people thought of me.
It was exhausting!
But no more.
These conventions are a godsend.
There is a freedom in letting go, Moira.
Okay Alexis, let's do this before I change my mind.
- Are you sure?
- Mhmm.
I don't want you to feel like I'm pressuring you - into anything.
- Oh, I'm sure.
As Gregson said, to milk this for all it's worth.
So let's get it going.
I have some fans to meet!
Okay, here's how it's gonna go down.
It's 30 seconds each, tickets in hand, or it's back of the line, and no, she will not be clarifying any "Sunrise Bay" plot points.
- Ahem!
Feet!
- Oh yes.
And if we're talking feet, it's $75 for one, $150 for the pair.
He's coming, he's coming!
Okay, he's coming, he's coming.
So are we on lights?
Also, we're going with "Surprise".
"Happy Birthday" was too wordy, and we couldn't nail it at rehearsal.
- Okay.
- Okay!
Okay, great.
-  - All: Surprise!
Oh my gosh!
David, I thought we were just having a casual dinner.
Mhmm.
Johnny: Happy Birthday, Patrick!
What is happening?
I thought you guys were out of town!
- Well, we are.
-  We're just so happy to be included.
You've got a really wonderful friend here, Patrick.
Yep, I'm just glad you could make it, Mr. and Mrs. Brewer.
Um well, I should leave you all to catch up, and spend some quality time with your son.
But might I recommend the crab cakes?
I over-ordered, and they cost a small fortune.
Hey, could I just have two seconds with him?
Sure.
What if they don't react the way I think they will?
Then I will be here.
And we'll get through it together.
Okay - I love you.
- I love you.
Well, I am suitably surprised.
Thank you guys for coming.
Clint: Well, we wouldn't miss it.
We just love you so much.
I love you guys, too.
- But um - Both:  Yes?
Well, there's something that uh that I've been meaning to tell you.
- You can tell us anything!
- Honey, let's just let him talk.
Uh, yeah.
So I guess this doesn't really come naturally.
Um David He seems like a really great partner, honey.
- Marci.
- In business.
Yeah, he is.
He's also a great partner outside of business.
We're together.
David is my boyfriend.
And I've never been happier in my life.
And so I just, I hope you guys can accept that.
Ohh!
You are the only thing in the world that matters to us.
And if David makes you happy, then that's all we care about.
Dad?
I like him.
I like him a lot.
Me too.
I don't understand his clothes, but  Ah, you will in time.
Oh man, I didn't know how I was gonna tell you guys.
Well, we're just glad you finally did.
Happy birthday, my sweet boy.
Thank you.
So I know that you're annoyed that the surprise got blown, but this party might go down as one of the happiest nights of my life.
Well, I guess that makes up for the fact that no one ate the crab cakes.
Well so how long have they known?
- I'm sorry?
- My parents.
How long have they known?
About us?
Um, I don't know, I don't know what you're talking about.
David, I know my parents.
They're not good actors.
They knew about us, right?
Okay, my Dad might've told them, but he, he thought they knew.
And the gift basket that you gave them that I'm hoping you paid for, that had nothing to do with you trying to smooth things over with them?
It was just a very messy day, And I was, I was trying to detangle things, and - and just make everything okay.
- Yeah.
Well, you made everything okay.
Twyla: Not to step on the moment, but uh, I do have to lock up in five.
- Oh.
- Right.
What a feeling in my soul Love burns brighter than sunshine
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1   Stop, oh my God!
Oh!
You must be having a lovely morning.
Hey now, it's just getting started.
Is it just getting started?
Because it looks like the two of you have been engaged in general merriment for quite some time now.
- Did he just say "merriment"?
- I think he did.
Yes, I said "merriment".
Because that's what happens when I spend too much time with my mother, and I blame you two for it.
So how was uh, dinner last night?
Ooh, long.
We spent two and a half hours going over a costume lineup for the show.
All so that you two of you could sneak off to some secret dance rehearsal behind her back like a pair of dirty con artists.
Hey listen, David, your Mom is a great director.
She's just not used to working with amateur dancers.
Yeah, last week she told me to dance like an Indonesian scarf caught in the wind.
I don't even know what that looks like.
This "Money" number is so complicated that if we don't get the outside help, we will be laughed off stage.
You've seen me dance.
Yes, you have legs like tree trunks, - we knew that going into this.
- Thank you.
Can we just have one more private session with Derek, - and then it's done.
- One more session?
!
I thought last night was the last session!
Well, we couldn't nail the final lift.
What is this, "Dirty Dancing"?
!
David, please, just keep her distracted for one more night.
No.
No!
It's too much!
Okay, then I guess we can just tell her we're getting outside help.
Mm, good luck.
When she was coaching me for the "Little Mister" pageant, I made the mistake of going to Mario Lopez for advice, he was the hosting at the time.
Anyway, she found out, and felt so betrayed, she "forgot" to double-knot my tap shoes, and cost me the crown.
So I will cover for you for one more night.
But that is it!
This better be worth it.
Excuse me, I have a job to do.
Oh.
Mm, Ted, it smells so good in here!
What's the occasion?
Brunch.
That we were supposed to make together.
Oh, don't worry, babe, I've already eaten.
So then I guess I'll just have your plate - for dinner, then.
- Mm, yum!
Hey, so I was thinking about maybe going into work - a little bit later today.
- Ah!
Yay, if that means more Teddy time for me, then yes.
No actually, I've been thinking about maybe taking a longer break from work.
I'm listening.
What if we got out of town, just the two of us?
- Like Thelma and Louise?
- Nope.
Uh no, I was thinking somewhere more exotic, like, I don't know, somewhere that would have beaches for you, and some interesting wildlife for me?
Okay, I've just been to Miami so many times before, and trust me, the "wildlife" is not as sexy up close.
No, I'm talking about farther away.
Like, I don't know the Galapagos Islands.
- I love that.
- Really?
Yes, as a jumping-off point, yes!
But if we're thinking islands, why don't we do something less sleepy and scary, like, The Maldives?
Definitely something to consider.
And I guess while we're spit-balling here, you know, it could be kinda fun to go somewhere that you've never been before.
Like, I don't know, the Galapagos Islands.
Yes, Ted!
An island somewhere for sure.
We just need to figure out where.
Mm.
But I'm so glad we're on the same page about this!
Yeah, yeah.
And-And what page is that?
Well, we both agree that we wanna get away, and we both agree that we're gonna land on somewhere so good.
Mhmm!
Roland: Hey, Johnny.
I heard the news.
Boy, we are really going to miss Moira tonight at the annual Mayor's Roast.
I was looking forward to getting scorched.
Oh yeah, well, she's gonna miss it, too.
Yeah, I mean, when she starts going off, oh my God, you better have the burn unit on speed dial.
I mean, get the fire extinguishers ready, because she is just slinging heat!
- Which ultimately becomes fire.
- Yeah, I get it, I get it.
She can, she can be funny on occasion.
Yeah, it's okay though, I've got uh, Bob's cousin, Louis, from Elm County, he's gonna come in and fill in for her, so.
Yeah well, Louis' the last guy that should be driving in for tonight.
Uh no, I-I uh I'm more than capable of taking Moira's place.
Johnny, I don't think so.
Those are pretty high heels to fill.
Well, don't you worry about me, I've uh I've handled myself pretty well humorously speaking, in front of large crowds before.
Jeez, if you bring up that Rose Video shareholder's meeting again You better be spending this time toughening your skin, Because I've got more than a few rippers up my sleeve for tonight.
Okay um, first off, I have no idea what "rippers" are.
Well, maybe you'd know, if you graduated elementary school.
I can't believe you said that to me.
Oh Roland, I'm sorry, did I Was that too far?
Look at your face!
"Oh Roland, I'm sorry, did I go too far"?
Oh pal, you are going to get eaten alive tonight!
-  - Oh!
Moira: David!
What are you doing walking the streets all by yourself?
You make me sound like a feral cat.
I'm walking home.
Don't tell me the store is already laying off people!
No, Patrick sent me home to get a check that apparently is tax for the government, and not, as I assumed, a bonus for me.
Well, I'm glad I caught you, because I got your missive about wanting to sup this evening, and I'm afraid I must decline.
What?
Why?
Why?
David, full disclosure, you have been awfully clingy of late.
Okay I think it might be propitious for you to spend some time with your peers.
What's Patrick doing tonight?
Or Stevie?
They're um, busy.
Busy?
Well, rehearsals end sharply at six, so either one of them should be free to dine with you thereafter.
I just don't think they're available tonight.
Hmm, too tired?
- Mm, yes.
Yeah.
- Yes.
They've both been struggling.
Yeah, that's-that's it.
Your choreography has been working them so hard they basically just go home and fall sleep, so actually your show is stripping me of a social life.
Alright, David, but it'll have to be a working repast.
I could use your eye for the final design of the posters.
Okay?
You employ the wrong font, and you may as well bid Auf Wiedersehen to ticket sales.
- Can't wait.
- Until then, dear!
We're both going home though!
What the hell?
!
Alexis, you don't need to do those dishes.
I didn't, I just put them on the counter.
Um, I also found this on the counter.
"Charles Darwin Research Center".
- What is this?
- Oh, nothing.
Just-just some work stuff.
It says you were one of ten people selected for a research program.
Oh, what?
That's crazy.
Is this why you kept bringing up those islands this morning?
Oh, the Galapagos Islands?
Uh, not necessarily, no.
Ted, why else would anyone wanna go there?
You mean, other than wanting to study some of the rarest and most diverse forms of plant and animal life on the planet?
Uh, yeah, I guess you have a point.
You were selected out of thousands of applicants?
It just means that they'll have plenty of people to pick from when I don't accept.
Ted!
Why didn't you tell me you were doing this?
Because I applied before we got back together, and it takes a couple years to process the applications.
A couple years?
It sounds important.
Well, listen, it's not not important.
But I can, I can always apply again.
You know, Emmett, the tortoise is 180-years-old, So I'm sure he'll still be around in another few years.
You love old tortoises!
It sounds like a dream.
How long is the program?
Six months.
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, see, this is why I didn't wanna push it on you this morning, okay?
Because you mean way more to me than some dumb once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity.
Ted, I don't know what to say.
I'd totally think about it, but like, my laptop's here Okay, honestly, just don't worry about it.
Well, what about long distance?
I once maintained a successful, semi-committed text relationship with Josh Hartnett while he was shooting "Pearl Harbor".
Okay, Alexis, I appreciate your creative problem solving, But.
you know, I-I wouldn't stay if I didn't feel like it was it was the right choice for me.
Babe, are you sure?
- Yes.
- But are you sure, sure?
Because I don't want you to not go like, just because of me.
Okay Alexis, that's exactly what's happening, but it's fine, okay?
And I told you that it's fine, so it's-it's fine!
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay so we're all good, then.
That was a good talk for everyone.
You know what I am gonna do?
I'm gonna do those dishes.
Babe, do you have a dishwasher?
Okay, I'm just gonna I'm gonna figure it out then.
Okay.
Sounds like someone's in a good mood.
What?
Me?
Oh.
Sorry, you know those days where you're just like, - super in love?
- Hmm, not really.
You will.
Anyway, I'm just thinking about Ted and me.
I can't believe we've come such a long way, you know?
Aww!
Yeah.
I just feel so lucky to be with someone who would do anything for me.
Like, I just found out that he got this crazy job opportunity, and he's turning it down just to be with me.
Wow.
That is lucky.
He was ten people picked out of like, ten thousand.
Oh my God, and he's not going?
No, I think his perspective was that there would be other opportunities.
Still, that must be totally heartbreaking for him.
But I guess relationships are all about sacrifice.
Oh my God, yes, Ted and I are so good at that whole give and take thing.
Like, he gives me so much, and I have learned to take as well.
And I'm sure you give things up for him all the time as well.
Totally.
But also, he never really asks me to, so that's hard for me to do for him.
But if he did, I would.
Oh, so he didn't ask you to go with him?
Not technically.
Okay.
One day I hope I find a guy like Ted.
Someone who would literally put all their hopes and dreams aside to be with me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks for the chat, Twy.
You're like my little fairy godmother, if she wore an apron, and Celine Dion's perfume.
Oh, so I've got a lot of good material here, I just need some help sifting out the gold.
I still don't see why you dragged us into this.
Well, you can be a tough audience, Ronnie.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- See?
That's what I'm looking for, honest reactions.
Well, I've been honestly reacting quite strongly to your aftershave.
It's a bit too European for my taste.
Not the most helpful feedback, Bob.
Look, now that you've trapped us here, just What-what do you got, Johnny?
Okay, here we go.
Well, it's 1791, and three explorers have landed Next.
I was flipping through the phone book the other day, and The phone book?
How old are these?
!
Well, you're not even letting me get to the punchlines, Ronnie.
Johnny, you need a search and rescue team to find the punchlines for those setups.
Ah!
Top ten things you don't want Roland - to be in charge of - Ten too many.
Johnny, you gotta be short and quick, Like Roland in the bedroom.
Now, that, that one kills every year.
Oh no, I love that one, is that one up for grabs?
No.
You've gotta go for the jugular, Just stay away from spouses, kids, and health, and you'll be fine.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta get back to work, which, up until now, was the most boring part of my day.
Well, I'd love to use that Roland in the bedroom joke.
Fine, but I have a feeling it ain't gonna help you.
Man, when she's on fire, look out!
Well, you haven't seen me on fire, Bob.
I'm glad I let you talk me into another dinner, David.
That note you had about including my name on the poster as a sales tool, that's something I've been debating for some time now.
Well, your name was already on the all mock-ups, so it was really more of an observation.
That reminds me, I must pop by the rehearsal space, Jocelyn said some color samples were dropped off today.
Okay yeah, I hmm.
I don't know if-I don't know if I need to see color samples, you just showed me all the mock-ups.
But the printers require my sign-off first thing, David.
Well, it's-it's late, I mean, it's It's 7:15.
Are you sure you should be walking over there alone at this hour?
Okay David, no more "True Crime TV" before bed for you.
I refuse to buy you another night-light!
Okay, well why don't I just pick them up for you, then?
-  - Ah!
Hey, be careful!
Both: When you haven't any coal in the stove And you freeze in the winter and curse through the wind And your fate when you haven't any shoes on your feet And your coat's thin as paper And you look 30 pounds underweight When you go to get a word Of advice from the fat little pastor What the hell?
!
I don't-I don't know.
Both: At the window  - At the window!
- Who's there?
- Hunger!
- Ooh, hunger!
Both: See how love flies out the door Money makes the world go round The world go round the world Money makes the world go round The clinking clanking sound of Money money money money money money money money - Get a little!
- Get a little!
Both: Money money money money A mark, a yen, a buck, or a pound Clinking clanking clunking sound It's all that makes the world go round Makes the world go round!
- Stevie: Oh my God.
- Ahem.
David, what are you doing here?
I have questions.
Mrs. Rose, this is Derek.
He's been just helping us practice the steps to the number.
And how long have you all been moonlighting?
Just just about a week.
It's a really fun piece.
Yes, I'm aware, thank you.
- I'm just gonna head outside.
- Stevie: Yeah.
Yes.
Thanks, Derek.
So all this time I thought Poor David thought that you were home, resting your instruments!
- Ohh - I'm so disappointed.
- Both: Sorry, David.
- It's okay.
However, in the business of show, skullduggery, when it leads to such thrilling results, a pinch of moral corruption is a small price to pay.
- Oh, is that good?
- Yeah, I think so.
You choreographed this?
I loosened the pickle jar.
Derek merely popped the lid.
Very impressed.
Was not embarrassed at all.
And I thought I would be.
So sweet.
Babe!
I didn't like how we left things this morning.
Me neither.
I'm the one that should be sorry.
No, I should've been more direct, and we should've just talked this through.
And I actually did some research on the Maldives, and there's this beautiful resort that we could stay at, it just means we might have to work there part-time, to cover the costs.
But I feel like I could teach windsurfing.
Of course you've done research on this trip.
But you've done too much for me already.
You do too much for me.
And so I think it's time that I give something back to you.
My FitBit?
No.
I lost that.
But the last thing I wanna do is stand between you and this job.
You've worked so hard, and I'm proud of you.
And so, yes, Ted Mullens, I will go to the Cayman Islands with you.
Uh, you mean the Galapagos?
Yeah, wherever the turtles are.
Are you sure, sure?
No.
But, yes.
Muah!
Alexis, you continue to amaze me.
I can't wait to do this with you.
Oh!
We're gonna need to shots.
Yes!
Let's celebrate!
Uh, no, no, no, I meant like, vaccinations.
Mm Yeah, just 'cause we'll be spending a lot of time in tents, and there could be disease-carrying - insects around, so.
- Okay.
Okay.
Um, this is still very fresh.
I made this decision like, two minutes ago, so why don't we focus more on the beach, and less on the details?
Fair enough.
When it comes to making decisions, Roland likes to go with his gut.
And boy, does he have a lot of gut to go with.
- Ohhhh!
-  Yes, I do.
And look at Bob, pretending to get it.
And we all know Gwen, he hasn't gotten it in years!
All: Ohhh!
Oh, that-Ronnie is just crushing it!
I mean, you know, everybody really has so far.
Okay, okay, that's all I got for now.
So I'm just gonna hand it over to the one who wears the pants in the Rose family.
But Moira is not here right now.
So I'm gonna pass it over to Johnny.
All right, Johnny!
Go on!
Head on up there!
Let's see what you've got up your starched sleeve of yours.
I'll tell you what I've got up my sleeve Roland, a few tasty little rippers that uh are more palatable than anything Jocelyn's been serving up tonight, so.
Hey, is that a crack about my cooking?
From the guy who's had four helpings?
-  - Roland: Yeah!
Oh, and Bob's joking about me having four helpings, we all know if you've ever taken your car to Bob's Garage, he's not necessarily known "four helpings" anyone.
Well anyway, a couple of little improvs there to get started, but uh, uh - what was I saying?
- Nothing funny so far.
Hey Johnny, come on, I've got a white flag, - why don't you just start waving it?
- All: Ohhh!
Yeah, Roland, may I point out that I was quiet when everyone else was up here doing their roasts.
I wish you were quiet right now!
Well, things seem to be going downhill fast.
Which is what the town must've been thinking when Roland elected himself Mayor.
Okay, I'll give him that.
Oh, got a smile out of Ronnie.
The last time anyone saw her this happy was at a 3-for-1 sale on cargo pants!
Where?
Where?
All right, Johnny, starting to make some moves, now.
Cargo, I said car-go, which is what a car is supposed to do unless you take it to Bob's Garage!
Well listen, I don't want to overstay my welcome, I'll keep things short and quick.
Which reminds me of the last time I was in Roland's bedroom, um well, I-I wasn't in Roland's bedroom, but the - Ah!
What was it, Ronnie?
- Just sit down, Johnny.
Well anyway, the punchline is, it was short and quick.
Anyway, I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead, folks.
I think it's a little late for that, pal.
- Ohhh!
-  Good job, Johnny, all right.
Johnny: No, I wish you guys could've been there tonight.
I was really ripping into them.
Yes, I'm sure you killed them, dear, with all the venom of a silkworm.
Oh, you know what, Moira?
Jealousy doesn't look good on you.
Much like that mirrored jumpsuit you wore to Candy Spelling's 50th!
- John!
- Oh my God, Dad!
Why don't you take it easy, Alexis, like you did with your education?
-  - Ugh!
- I mean, he's not wrong.
- Oh, look at David.
Smart enough to get that joke, but not smart enough to stop wearing sweaters in the middle of summer.
Burn, David!
Okay, here's why that joke didn't work.
And look at you, John.
A worthy competitor emerges.
Something the good people at Blockbuster never said about Rose Video.
Ha!
Ha!
That was low, like David's standards.
Or the placement of Alexis' back tattoo.
Alexis has a back tattoo?
Alexis, what have you done to yourself?
!
It says "that's hot" in Cantonese.
- Got it in Hong Kong.
- Ugh!
I was 12-years-old!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Dobro jutro, my darlings!
That, of course, is good morning in - Bosnian.
- We know!
Well, I happened upon the most charming petite patisserie this morning, and I thought, my children deserve breakfast in bed!
Okay, have we done something?
I'm so confused.
What do you want?
Just to be near you.
Chalk it up to the heightened emotionality of opening night just around the corner, and my bebe girl leaving me so soon!
Okay.
Thank you so much.
- I'm not convinced.
- Moira: My pleasure.
Oh!
And the programs arrived today.
Can't wait to see them.
500 shiny new programs.
Aren't these just the cinnamon buns from the lobby?
And wouldn't you know it, they have presented themselves unfolded.
Oh no, so you have to fold them all?
Theoretically.
But then you remember my crippling carpal tunnel from all those years of signing checks.
So why don't I grab you a big stack, and you two can turn it into a fun game.
I'm out for the afternoon.
Patrick is taking me on a picnic.
- Hm.
- Then Alexis, perhaps you can bring a few hundred to the cafe, and you and Twyla can gossip and fold, and fold and gossip?
Nope, this is my one day off, and Ted and I are doing trip stuff.
They need to be folded!
And I brought you pastries, and coffees!
Okay well, this coffee has nothing in it.
Oh, it's just a gesture, David!
- Stop being so literal.
- Okay   Hey, what are we doing over here?
Well, Galapagos has some pretty killer beaches, so I thought we should come prepared.
Oh my God, Turkish Cosmo once included my photo on their list of the world's best sarongs.
So let's just say I know my way around a beach.
All right, uh goggles, snorkels.
I don't actually go in the open water, but I can't wait to see you do that.
- What else?
- We got lots of stuff.
Biodegradable shampoo, and - malaria pills.
- Excuse me?
!
Uh no, they're just preventative.
We'll also be bringing insect repellant.
Okay.
Maybe we can just get one of those sexy little mosquito nets for around our bed?
Those are actually an insane safety hazard.
If they catch fire, you're basically trapped in a burning cage, so.
- But, totally.
-  Actually, you know what?
Why don't we go grab some breakfast, and I will tell you more about our bed there, and what we'll be doing in it.
Theodore!
Look at this romantic getaway you've planned.
It's gonna be the best.
We've just gotta make a quick pit-stop at the doctor's, to get some vaccines, and then we'll grab a bite.
Okay, part of me is wondering if we even need the vaccines?
No, it's just a quick needle, Alexis.
Think of it like um, getting Botox.
Ew, Ted!
What am I, 32?
Oof!
- Patrick: Oh.
- David: Sure.
- Hey, what are we doing?
- We're here.
Yeah, I just sorta feel like picnicking by the side of the road is basically an invitation to be murdered.
We're going on a hike, David.
What, you always say you wanna do more physical activity, right?
Yes, so that you can tell me I don't need to!
I thought we were going on a picnic.
We are.
We just have to hike to get there.
Yeah, I was picturing us like, on a charming park bench in the middle of a private English garden.
David, you have to stop watching "Notting Hill".
It's not helpful for our relationship.
- Okay.
Speak for yourself.
- There you go.
- What is this?
- That's your picnic basket.
We're gonna need our hands free for the - For the hike.
- Hey, you're gonna love this.
- Trust me.
- Will I?
-  -  Let's go, David!
Okay.
That's it.
Oh, look at you, John, my handsome proletarian.
All rumpled and sweaty.
Well, I'd be less sweaty if Roland hadn't just stood there and watched me load all the furniture onto his truck.
Johnny, I am loaning you my truck.
And besides, I think you'd look good with a little working-man glow on you.
I could do without the musky aroma though, whew!
You know, Moira, when you said you needed a few pieces of furniture from the motel to round out the set for Cabaret, I didn't think you'd be robbing us blind.
According to Mrs. Rose, our motel is the only place sad enough to pass for a pre-war Berlin brothel.
Are you okay, Mr. Rose?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be fine.
Uh, Moira, what else?
Anything else I can do?
If you'll just get this seating chart to the truck, you'll be then free as a bird.
Until we get to the theater.
Yeah, I'll spot you, Johnny.
Lift with your legs.
-  - There you go.
- Ah!
Oh!
- Oh John, be careful!
- It's a rental.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
It slipped right through my fingers.
Just like your youth, right, old man?
Mr. Rose, do you think maybe you should just take a seat for a second?
Uh okay.
Just for a minute, though.
I'm good.
Wow, Johnny, are you okay?
How long has this affliction been operative?
Yeah, I felt a little tightening this morning, Moira, when I picked up that box of programs from the printer's, but I'm good.
John, how was I to know you were in peril?
You keep everything inside, like a bashful clam!
Okay, Mrs. Rose, I think maybe we should take him - to the hospital.
- That sounds alarmist.
Right, John?
It's just a little muscle pull, that's all, Moira.
Yeah, you know, my cousin, Lenny, had the same exact thing, Johnny.
Well, what did your cousin do?
Can we call him?
You can try, I don't think you'll have much luck.
The poor guy died of a heart attack.
What?
No!
John?
John, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Try to follow the sound of my voice.
Moira, I'm gonna need your voice to take five for a minute, thank you.
Okay, I really think we should go to the hospital.
Okay, you know what?
I think I think may-maybe it's time to go.
Okay, no one panic.
Okay Stevie, get your car.
John's a slow driver.
We'll leave the programs behind.
Or maybe we'll bring a stack for the trip?
- N-no, Mrs. Rose!
- You're right.
- Everybody move!
- Okay.
No!
Not you, John!
Twyla: So this card means luck.
- I think.
And - What's going on here?
Twy, I didn't know you played solitaire.
I don't.
These are tarot cards.
I'm raising money for a new dishwasher, so I'm offering five dollar card readings.
Yeah, and she's good too.
Last time she told me I was in for a bit of luck, and I won ten bucks on a lotto ticket.
- Whoa!
- I spent $20, but still.
Ahem!
Um, so where did you learn how to tell fortunes, Twy?
Oh, one of my mom's ex-boyfriends was a magician, and a gambling addict.
But he was also really good at reading tarot cards.
He predicted when he was going to leave my mom like, to the day.
Yeah, that's kinda why I don't love this stuff.
It can really mess with your head.
Babe.
It's for charity.
Twyla needs someone to wash her dishes.
No, no, the restaurant needs a new appliance.
Oh, okay.
Well, you should probably get your story straight if you're getting people to donate money, though.
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- Oh, okay, fine.
But only because it's for a good cause.
- Yay!
- Okay Place your hands on the deck, and think about something you want.
Okay.
Hm Is something wrong, Twy?
Is there water near where you're going?
Yeah, we're going to an island.
Ooh!
I forgot it was an island!
And are there boats near the water?
Yeah, there are boats on the water.
Oh, we can charter this catamaran at sunset.
Yeah, so I see a boat capsizing.
- What?
- People screaming.
And a couple, like, under water.
And then it sort of fades to black.
Oh my God!
Ted!
Okay no, wait come on, you can't actually see that in these cards.
Well, I also need to interpret the cards.
Okay, so maybe you could interpret something a little more positive?
Oh, I also see a party.
People dressed up all fancy in black.
Like a black and white party?
Mm, more like a funeral.
Okay, there's no service here.
David, put your phone down.
We don't need service, we have each other.
Well, if you can track my eBay bid, then, by all means.
Did we really need two backpacks?
I mean, what are you keeping in these things?
Well, you had a pretty long list, and we needed ice packs to keep the cheese that you requested cold.
Well, did I get the ice pack one?
Because this is not light.
Just wonder why we couldn't have found a meadow somewhere, you know, with some men on horseback like, trotting in the background.
Okay, David, do you want to turn around?
!
Well, the app that's counting my steps isn't working, so I honestly don't know.
You know what?
I got up early to pack these bags for us because I thought this would be a fun thing to do together, but obviously that was a mistake.
Okay, wow.
So then, let's keep going, then.
Well no, 'cause there's like, another half an hour to go.
So I think it's probably better if we just call it now, and forget about the picnic.
Okay, well, we can't forget about the picnic, because I will need to eat at some point soon.
Really?
!
Okay!
I love that you've done this for us, and I think you look very dashing in your hiking clothes.
It's just a long way to go for some cheese.
Then let's turn around, David.
- Because honestly, Iohh!
- Where's the bear?
No, I stepped on a branch.
It went right through my shoe.
How do you know that it went through your shoe?
-  - Okay, everybody calm down.
- It's gonna be fine.
- Uhhuh.
- Uh-huh?
So that - We should go to the - Okay.
This way.
- It's right in the soft part.
Yeah, I can see that.
Okay, why?
Why are we still waiting?
Moira, it's a hospital.
Why don't you sit down, sweetheart?
John?
John, I have sentiments that I that I often say to myself, and I don't say them out loud to you, and I'd like you to hear them.
Well, there are people around, Moira, so depending on what it is you're planning on saying.
I have given far too much attention to this bicorn of a show.
And I want you to know, John, that you are the most important thing in this world to me, you know that, don't you?
And I include Caroline in that, and I've had that wig for 40-years.
You don't have to be doing this, Moira.
- John, if you make it through - When!
- When what?
- When he pulls through!
Yes!
Everything will change, John.
We are going to eat healthier, no well, not less, less wine at dinner.
I'll have to keep the pills, but I'm not one who's the health risk here.
Mrs. Rose, you really need to sit down, because at this point I feel like I am at risk of heart failure.
Okay, I've been calling David, and he's not picking up!
And what about Alexis?
There's an idea.
Anybody have her number?
I'll text her.
Okay, Johnny, um I figured you were probably hungry, so um, I got you some snacks; here's some chips.
And then, this, Johnny, is an energy drink.
So that you can stay awake.
No!
He shouldn't be having any of that.
Will you stop going to the vending machine?
I'm sorry, Stevie, hospitals make me nervous.
The last time I was in one was with Lenny.
Although he didn't stay very long.
- Oh my God!
- What is wrong with you?
!
Hm?
- Okay, Johnny Rose?
- Yeah.
- Here.
- Hi, I'm Doctor Lipman.
We're gonna take you back for some tests.
- Good.
- Is "tests" code for open heart surgery?
You can tell me, I once played a nurse on "M.A.S.H".
- Okay, is it a heart attack?
- At this point, we just want to find out what's going on.
- Mr. Rose.
Okay.
- Yeah, I'll be fine.
- You're gonna be okay.
- I'll be fine.
Okay.
Be careful with him.
Precious cargo.
Whoa, whoa, Moira.
Too soon, too soon.
Come on.
Okay, David, - I need you to pull it out.
- Okay, I told you I don't think that's a good idea.
What, you think leaving it in is a better idea?
!
I would do it myself, but it needs to be pulled straight out.
- Okay!
- Just pull it out, David!
- Oh my God!
- Straight out.
Eyes need to be open, please.
Ss!
Shh Shh for a second.
Okay.
Is it bleeding?
- I don't know, my shoe is on!
- Okay.
Yeah, I don't see anything, but we should still put something on it, because I don't trust where that stick has been.
Now, which of these backpacks have the first aid kit in it?
I didn't bring one.
It was either the first aid kit, or the ice packs.
I wanna go home, David!
This whole day's been a bust.
Well, that's not happening, so - What is that?
- It's hand sanitizer, it can be used as a disinfectant.
You think I'd come to a picnic without it?
Okay, there we go.
We'll reapply later, but at least I don't have to worry about gangrene.
I'm sorry for not appreciating you enough today.
You've packed two big backpacks full of food, and not a Band-aid to be found in either of them, but still.
If you wanna keep hiking, I think we should keep hiking.
No, I don't think so.
But thank you.
I think I sorta killed the romance.
No, you didn't.
You planned this beautiful day for us.
And I think we should finish it.
Can you walk?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Then we keep going.
Also, I'm starving, and I need to eat something.
I should probably get out in front, David.
You have no idea where you're going.
- Okay.
That's fair.
- Ow!
Hey!
Hey.
Whatcha doin' there?
Um, just being on the internet.
Alexis, that's just an image search for intense boating disasters?
I just wanted to know what I would look like after a catamaran accident.
Come on, you can't tell me that you actually believe Twyla's card reading.
Of course not.
We're just like, super-duper sure that this is the vacation we want to be taking?
What?
This is not a vacation.
I'm going for work.
And look, if you're scared of drowning, we don't have to go on the catamaran tour.
Oh, it's more than that, Ted.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've been traveling the world since I was a teen model.
But something about this just feels different.
Is this about the juice stand?
Because I told you, we can just make our own.
There's fruit literally everywhere.
Okay, this might sound insane, but I've had this like, nagging feeling that as soon as I get there, I'm gonna start thinking about my family.
That-that doesn't sound insane.
Okay, maybe I'm not expressing myself clearly.
Like, I will physically be there, but I will be thinking about them here.
Right, so what you're describing is missing someone, and it is a totally normal feeling.
Well, this is a new feeling for me, Ted!
What if something happens to David?
I'm basically his only friend.
Or my Dad.
David and my mom sometimes gang up on him, and I'm basically his only friend.
Okay, Alexis, you are taking a step out of the nest for the first time in a while, and that's a good thing.
And if we get there, and we hate it, well, we'll probably have to wait it out a bit, just because it's pretty far away, and it would be pretty tough to re-book our travel arrangements, but if we still hate it after that, we can just come home.
You're right.
Oh, no, no, we're gonna close that now.
'Cause there are some pretty disturbing images on there.
Oh God!
Man on  Dr. Stevens, Room One.
Well, you know, uh I'm just gonna go ahead and say it.
It's been a long time, that's usually not a good sign.
- Roland.
- Hmm?
I don't think Mrs. Rose needs to hear that right now.
In the Balkan Peninsula they say, "silence is but an empty serving platter".
I'm sure there's a deluge of benign reasons they're keeping John back there.
Yeah, I'm sure.
He-he probably just roped them into one of his long-winded stories.
Or he could be on a table with a triple bypass.
Mr. Rose is gonna be fine, he has to be.
I mean, I can't be left alone with this motel.
I don't do math.
Dr. Lipman: Hey, folks.
I have an update on Mr. Rose's condition for you.
We did an endoscopy, and found it was in fact severe heartburn.
We gave him an antacid, a strong one, and he's doing just fine.
Johnny: And I drained a 20-footer, and finished with an eagle.
John!
You scared me!
Oh Johnny, I thought this was the end of the road for you, pal!
Ohhh!
You're a blessing, my friend!
A blessing!
A real blessing.
- You are.
- Thank you, Roland.
Ohhh Mr. Rose needs to lay off the morning cinnamon buns, and steer clear of acidic foods for a while.
But apart from that, he's good to go.
Is he, then?
Well, he did say that there have been some fatal cases of heartburn.
Did I?
Is everything okay, Stevie?
Yep, I'm just really not looking forward to folding those programs.
It's good to have you back, Mr. Rose.
Well, it's good to be back.
And thank you, Doctor.
I'll have to call you with the rest of that Pebble Beach story.
Oh John, the man's done enough!
- David, I'm fine.
- You were limping, and the rest of the hike would've made it worse.
Plus, you don't want to know what my Mom would do if you showed up to opening night, and couldn't walk.
Oh, okay.
Oh boy.
Oh oh!
Well, this is nice.
I wouldn'tve made you hike all this way if I didn't think it was gonna be worth it.
I know you a little better than that.
Okay, so how should I set up the picnic?
Yeah, I think it might be a bit late for that.
Why don't we uh, why don't we just take in the view for a little while, and then we'll save the picnic for another day?
Okay, I didn't carry you up a mountain not to eat cheese after, so I don't know, David.
Okay, just tell me what to do, and I'll set it all up!
Okay, fine.
Um in the red bag there's a blanket, you can take that out and lay it down, Okay.
This is nice.
Uh, in the second bag, there is a bundle of crackers and cheese.
- Uh excuse moi!
- And champagne.
Hmm!
And uh, just one more thing.
Um, if you go into that front pocket there, there's actually something.
Get it open.
What's going on?
So I used to come on this hike a lot, when I first moved here, and I was uh, I was developing feelings for this guy I had just gotten into business with.
And I didn't know what to do about it because I didn't know if that guy had the same feelings.
Or if I'd ever be able to muster up the courage - to let him know how I felt.
-  And now, here he is.
The love of my life, standing in front of me.
And this just felt like the perfect place to ask you to marry me.
Wha-are you sure?
Easiest decision of my life.
Mm!
Are these 24-karat?
It's a yes, it's a yes!
I love you.
- Hey, Twy.
- Alexis.
Hey, what's up?
Nothing, I was just on my way back from Ted's, and I thought I'd pop in and see how you're doing, girl.
Good shift?
Is this about the card reading earlier?
What?
No.
I've been thinking about the card reading earlier, and I just feel like it wasn't the greatest send off, you know?
So hopefully I'll get a better one this time, and it will just like, erase the other one.
I'd be glad to do it, Alexis, but I should warn you, I think the deck may be cursed.
I predicted four other drownings today.
Okay, well maybe you should get a new deck.
Death aside, your last reading was really good.
It was?
You guys got up from the table before I could get to it.
I flipped the Ten of Cups.
And?
And I saw your family with this big golden ring of light around them.
Like you all had something to celebrate.
- Hm.
- It's gonna be a good year, Alexis.
You're on the right path.
Thanks, Twy.
You're welcome.
And that golden ring means prosperity.
Hm.
Either that or it's a stain from a beer bottle.
Because my mom's ex gave me the cards.
Ew.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
1   Oh my gosh, is this what marriage is?
Nope, this is just left over from the picnic yesterday, and I didn't wanna waste it so.
-  - Hmm, you could've lied.
And what are we doing over here?
Hmm.
I'm just editing some of our engagement photos.
- Oh!
- You look great.
I look like I crawled out from under a bridge.
Hey, have you given any more thought to uh, when you wanna start telling people?
I'm kinda scared to do it today, I don't think your mom would want anything upstaging opening night of the show.
Yeah, and I think we need that added hiccup, so - So, tomorrow then?
- Yeah.
I mean, I haven't really given it that much thought.
- Yeah.
- So one other option.
What if, after the show tonight, we corralled a few people back to the motel?
You know, we talk about the show for five to ten minutes, then maybe dim the lights, pop some bubbly, put some music on.
I could stand up and give a speech.
I'd look to you, you don't need to give a speech, but at this point I think Alexis will be getting misty, which will send sort of this intoxicating ripple effect through the room.
Most people will be sobbing.
And I'll be holding back tears, but the fact that I'm holding them back, I think, will make it all the more powerful.
And you can be topping up drinks.
Great to know you've barely given this any thought.
I am gonna start the day.
Big show tonight.
- Good luck, honey!
- It's "break a leg".
Aah!
Oh, just checking in on my little girl, and see how she's feeling about everything.
Okay, she'd be feeling a lot better if you weren't checking in every five minutes.
Anyway, I just stopped by to uh give you this.
Thank you.
That's very sweet.
Well, you don't have to open it now.
No need to open it now, you can open it later.
Even though the intention was to maybe open it before the show.
Okay, fine, I will open it now.
But ever since I told you I was leaving, you've been giving me little things that just make me feel bad about it.
Oh, that's not true, honey.
That's-that not true at all.
Like this.
Well, that's a little something you can use backstage tonight, or maybe put it on your bedside table when you're away.
You expect me to bring this with me?
!
This frame is like, ten pounds!
"Break all your legs".
A well-intentioned, if not slightly misguided sentiment from the Elmdale Arts Council.
Alexis, when do you and Theodore depart for your equatorial adventure?
Ted leaves tonight.
I leave in a week.
Well, that seems like poor planning.
Why aren't you flying with him tonight?
- Because I'm in the show.
- Well, Of course you are!
Oh!
Well, I have to tell you, I am impressed!
Alexis, my phone's been ringing nonstop since 7 a.m. you certainly engaged the press.
Thank you.
If I'm receiving this kind of buzz from a boutique theatrical run, imagine the fanfare you will drum up when the "Crows" movie gets its premiere date.
What do you mean, "that I will drum up"?
Well, after careful cogitation, and two attempts to get Lizzie Grubman to do some pro Bono work, I have decided Alexis, I would love you to do all my publicity!
Oh my God!
What?
!
When is this supposed to happen?
Last I heard, the fall.
I will be in the Galapagos.
Well, again, poor planning.
Well, you just told me right now!
Oh, this sounds like an opportunity, Alexis.
I mean, are you sure being away this long - is such a good idea?
- Yes!
I'm going to support my boyfriend, and hopefully, eat, pray, love, a bit for myself.
Yes.
Family!
Family.
We need to stop and embrace this precious moment.
And I'm not just saying that because David's at Patrick's, and the energy is unusually light around here.
We are all on the precipice of greatness.
And we should cherish these moments, before everything changes.
Hmm.
And I'm still cherishing.
Just oh, I do have to take this.
It could be the Elm Grove Sentinel calling about my cover story.
Moira Rose Enterprises, how may I direct your call?
Well, yes, my assistant is very busy.
Dad!
Uh oh.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Who are those for?
- They're for you.
I wanted to wish you luck for your big show.
You've been stepping very far outside of your comfort zone, and I think that takes a lot of courage.
I don't think I've ever heard you use - the word "courage" before.
- Hmm.
Outside of criticizing someone's style choices.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
You're only this happy when you have gossip, or there's something in the news about Oprah.
There's something in the news about Oprah.
She got new espadrilles.
Oh my God, David.
You have a show to focus on, we'll celebrate tonight.
Celebrate what?
You!
The show.
So, I guess I'll just see you tonight, then.
- Bye.
- Fine.
Patrick proposed, and I said yes.
Oh my God!
Oh my God, David!
- I know.
- Oh my God!
I'm so happy for you!
Oh!
Oh my God!
When did this happen?
Last night.
Oh my God!
Ohhh!
Are you okay?
Oh!
Yes.
I'm happy!
You just caught me off guard.
See, this is why I wanted to wait.
No, I'm glad you told me!
It's just nerves.
About the show.
Okay.
Which I should get back to doing.
Because there's this scene that I just can't get.
Well, you are the only person I've told, so if we could just keep this between us until after the show, that would be great.
Got it.
Congratulations, David.
Thank you.
Roland: Yeah, uh, dark hair.
Answers to the name "Stevie".
Um, kind of looks like a vampire.
A little skittish when approached.
Um, you know, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but if you have a tazer, you may want to use it.
Okay, yeah, thanks, bye.
I should've known the risk.
The toll that stage fright can take on someone who's not used to the hot sting of the spotlight.
I was a fool not to let Gwen understudy.
What is going on in here?
Stevie's gone missing, and I don't wanna be an optimist here, but it's not looking good.
What?
What do you mean, Stevie's gone missing?
I can't find her anywhere!
I've called her all day, and Bob saw her crying at the gas station.
The last thing she said to your father was, - What?
!
- She had to do something.
Well, I saw her this morning.
Huh, well you may have been the last person to see her, Dave.
I don't know how you're gonna feel about this, but I'm gonna need some hair samples.
What happened, David?
Did you say anything that might have triggered her?
You have that effect on people.
Uh, she said she was nervous about the show.
With but a handful of hours before curtain?
Any morsel of Intel is crucial!
Fine!
Patrick proposed to me yesterday, and I may have told her about it.
- Oh, David!
- Wow, a wedding.
Congratulations, Dave.
I don't know what to say.
I know, it was very overwhelming for me, as well.
Why could you not have waited until after the show to tell people you're engaged?
!
You're engaged?
!
This is not how the announcement was supposed go!
Okay, but I'm gonna be away!
- Who's gonna plan the wedding?
- Well, I could ask Jocelyn.
She planned her brother-in-law's funeral for under a hundred bucks.
Okay, this is like, the last thing I needed to hear today!
When did this become about you?
Exactly!
If we don't find Stevie, a lot of people are going to be very disappointed!
I just announced I'm getting married!
David, you and your wonderful Patrick have years to celebrate!
What a unanimously disastrous day this is turning out to be!
Ugh!
What the fuck?
!
Okay, so I told Stevie and next thing you know, she is nowhere to be found.
I just wish this whole engagement announcement hadn't gotten so out of control.
I mean, people are coming up to me that I haven't even spoken to yet.
Gentlemen, major show drama aside, I just wanted to say congratulations to the future Mister and Mister.
- Or is it "Misters"?
- See?
Now Jocelyn, how did you find out?
Oh, from Moira.
Maybe Alexis.
Possibly Gwen.
Thanks Jocelyn, but I'm actually a little more concerned about the show at the moment.
Don't worry, Moira says she has a plan.
Oh, does she?
Oh God, David!
No, no, no, no, David, I'm sorry.
No, just performers backstage from here on.
Mrs. Rose, are you-are you a performer at this point?
Unfortunately, I have no choice.
So I'm gonna shimmy off the rust, and pray there's still dazzle within.
Sorry, sorry.
Oh.
- Stevie, what the fuck?
!
- Mrs. Rose?
Stevie, thank God you're here!
Okay everybody, vocal warm up in the Green Room!
- Bye.
- Bye.
Good luck.
Mrs. Rose, I'm sorry.
I had an errand to run, and I got stuck in traffic on the way back.
Yeah, I've been calling you all day.
I know, you told me to block everyone out today, so I left my phone at home, which I realize was a really big mistake.
Oh, were you planning on taking my place?
Oh!
Just dressed in theme to support, that's all.
I think I'll um I'm going to go see if Jocelyn uh got the humidifier, excuse me.
I just have to check on her.
I just Jocelyn?
Okay, I'm sorry!
I should never have told you before the show.
Here.
What is this?
Patrick asked for my blessing a few weeks ago, so I had them made.
It would've been nice if he told me when it was happening, I literally could've picked these up any other day this week, but I will yell at him later.
I assume you two will be moving in together, and I won't be there to give you towels when you need them, - so - Thank you.
I appreciate the monogramming, and the choice of thread color.
I thought you were upset.
I was more upset that I had to drive to Elmdale today.
I also appreciate this burlesque-y get up.
Excuse me.
You're an almost married man, now.
Stevie.
I'd ask if you could hold us up more, but I'm not a big fan of rhetorical questions.
- Gotta go.
- Good luck!
Cast: Ahhhhh!
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
Hey David, congrats on the news!
Really happy for you guys.
Okay, you know what, the funny thing was, originally I was going to be the one that told people.
Told people what?
Oh, does your Dad not know?
If we're talking about Dave's big engagement news, uh, we haven't decided on a best man yet, but we think it's probably gonna be a black tie affair.
You're engaged?
Yeah.
Sure.
Oh, David, that's so exciting!
Oh son, you deserve all the happiness -  - We'll pick this up later.
Sorry.
Alexis made it seem like everyone knew.
- Oh, they do now, yeah.
-  Have fun, my darling.
Have fun!
You've gestated long enough beneath my wing.
Now it's time to fly!
- Okay - Fly.
Ohhh!
Oh!
Meine damen und herren, Mesdames et Messieurs, Ladies and Gentlemen!
I am your host.
Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome!
Fremde, etranger, stranger Patrick: Hello, stranger!

- Sorry?
- Magdalena.
The only other time I've leased one of my girls is the Halloween when David was desperate to be Alanis Morissette.
Well, glad you think I'm pulling it off.
Stevie, I'm so proud of you.
You're really powering through tonight.
Of course I never doubted you.
Thank you, but I still have an act and a half to prove you wrong.
Now I suppose David's announcement left you a little shaken.
That's really not it, Mrs. Rose.
It's just I wish I wasn't watching it all happen from behind the desk.
You know?
It feels like everyone's growing up all around me.
You know, before the "Crows" movie happened, I too thought there was no escape from this dark, troublesome existence that was my life in this town.
I was as hopelessly crestfallen as you are right now.
Uh, I wouldn't say I'm crest Shhh!
Use it.
I'm sorry?
Oh, I could so effortlessly conjure up the perfect words to bedazzle your spirits.
That's one of my gifts.
But no.
No, you need to be exactly where you are.
Okay, are you talking about me, or Sally?
Why, Sally, of course.
You I'm not worried about.
What the hell is your secret, Stevie?
You just stand your solid ground, refusing to be anything but you.
Hm.
Never thought I'd say this about anyone in this town, but you you're very, very cool.
And whether you set sail, or stay put, that's not going to change.
Now, why don't we take our Sally by the hand, and we go out there, and show those people everything she can be.
If she were only more like you.
Oh!
Thank you!
Maybe this time I'll be lucky Maybe this time He'll stay Maybe this time For the first time Love Won't hurry away He will hold me fast I'll be home at last Not a loser anymore Like the last time And the time before Everybody They love a winner So nobody loved me Lady Peaceful Lady Happy That's what I long to be Well, all the odds are There in my favour Something's bound to begin It's gonna happen Happen sometime Maybe this time Maybe this time I'll win   That's my friend!
Well, you dazzled tonight, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Oh, sorry, I don't know why I thought you were talking to me.
Well, it was a huge hit, the crowd went wild.
- I was shocked!
- Shocked?
Amazed.
I was amazed.
Amazed, yes.
You're gonna be late for the airport.
I can't wait to sip pina coladas with you.
Again, it's not really that kind of place, but yes.
- I love you.
- I love you.
Excuse me everybody, um, it's time for Ted to Galapa-go now.
- All: Ohhh!
- I love you so much!
Okay, great show everyone, bye.
- Partygoers: Bye.
- Johnny: Bye, Ted.
- Thank you so much.
- Hi everyone, hi!
I just, first and foremost, wanna say a big congratulations to Team Cabaret.
The show was awesome, you guys were so, so good!
Speaking of love Somebody got engaged!
Wow.
Speaking of love, um, I'm so glad that you're all here, because Patrick and I have some very special news.
You're getting married!
Jocelyn, I'm the one on the chair!
Now, two years ago, I went to fill out some paperwork for a business license, and little did I know, that I would end up meeting the love of my -  - God!
Oh, it is me.
Um, I'm sorry, David.
Sorry, it's most likely press.
I-I already know your engagement news.
So wait a minute, he's marrying you?
Okay, this shouldn't be so hard!
Oh my God, just spit it out, David!
Oh my God, fine!
I met someone who changed my life, and I don't know where I'd be without him.
So yes, as we all know now, Patrick and I are engaged.
All: Ohhh!
Moira: No!
Nooooo!
- Oh my God!
- Moira: Nooooo!
If it's a bad review, Moira, I wouldn't trust local critics.
No.
No, they uh, they shelved the "Crows" movie.
So it's-it's over.
It's over.
Nothing to see here, people.
The party's over.
Okay.
Yeah, you can leave your champagne flutes.
- Unless we still wanna do a toast?
- No.
Oh, no?
Okay.
Everyone leave the champagne flutes, - thank you.
