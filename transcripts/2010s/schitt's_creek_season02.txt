{START OF EPISODE 1}
- No, no, no!
No, no, no!
- No!
Noooo!
- What?
- My bag!
It's gone!
- What bag?
- My brown bag!
- What brown bag?
You had a room full of brown bags back home, which brown bag?
!
My crocodile bag, the one my mother gave me!
Oh, it's in the closet, next to my briefcase.
That's an ostrich bag.
Okay, just calm down, breathe, breathe.
Breathe breathe!
Okay David!
David must've taken it, along with my last molecule of hope!
Oh Moira, David only took his own bags.
Are you kidding?
!
I bet he's pawned it by now, to pay for manicures.
What possible sense would it make for David to take one of your bags?
It doesn't oh towels, great.
Mrs. Rose, you got out of bed.
Humph!
Sorry, am I interrupting something?
No, no, we're just, we're looking for something valuable, and um - Your son?
- Well, no, a brown bag, as a matter of fact.
Well our son, yes.
Has anyone heard from David?
Oh, to be so naive!
He's long gone, darling, escaped, and left us all behind.
Okay, well uh I've put in some calls to some people, just to get the word out.
Well, that's very nice.
That's, very nice Stevie, thank you very much.
That's, very considerate, because I know you and David had a Intimate uh, relationship.
Okay, I just came to drop off the towels, and check in, so.
Is that Stevie?
Can you ask her if she has any extra bedspreads?
I'm still here!
Oh!
Okay, then come here then, please, for a sec?
Yeah, um, come in.
Hey, does this place have any king sized sheets?
Alexis, what the hell are you doing?
!
Just giving myself some more space.
There's a lot going on in my life right now.
Like, Ted keeps harassing me for an answer to the whole, am I gonna marry him thing, and then there's the whole Mutt issue, which is very complicated, and sexy, so I'm just, I don't know what to do.
I take it you haven't heard from David.
Okay, yeah, fine.
And David's missing.
So yeah, well, he's missing.
Well, I can't find him, so what would you say he is?
Okay, you know what?
You know what?
!
I don't think your mother would appreciate you speaking to me in that way!
Well, I'm-I'm sorry for your loss.
Oh!
What'd they say!
Nothing, and I'm getting nervous, Moira.
Don't worry, he's fine.
It's not the first time David's run away, remember all those troubled years in high school, when he'd charter the jet without permission?
Yes, but he has no money.
Oh, he does now.
If there's one thing David knows, it's the street value of a woman's bag.
Okay, you know what, can we stop talking about that bag for five minutes, the bag, the bag, and the bag!
John, it's an heirloom, my great grandmother took it from her husband when she left him, and it has been passed down through all the women in my family, as emergency currency, in case we need to leave our husbands in the middle of the night.
Oh, well, that's reassuring.
You don't have to worry darling, I'll never need it.
But you know Alexis will!
Yeah, more than once, probably.
I love that bag.
And I've kept it safe all these years.
And now John, it's out there, - frightened, and alone - Okay, okay.
We'll find it, we'll find your bag.
- We'll find your bag, Moira.
- Oh, we better, please!
- Yes, we will.
- Please!
Hey, uh, I really shouldn't come in.
Actually, you're standing in my living room, - you let yourself in.
- Yeah, no, I know.
Um, so, about the other night - Uh huh.
- Oh!
Mm!
That night.
Um that was super fun.
I'd say it was the most fun I had all year.
Yeah, it was super fun.
Actually, I wouldn't mind having a little more fun, - right now.
- Okay And I love hearing you say that.
It's just that, when we got together, um, I thought my family was leaving.
- Uh huh.
- And now we're not.
So I would love to feel worse about your parents not selling the town, but Hmm, it's just, it's so tragic, 'cause my mom is in this like, waking coma, and my dad has developed more of a stutter, and uh, because we're not leaving, things are a little bit complicated with Ted.
I thought things were done with Ted.
Me too.
But apparently, he was misinformed.
- By who?
- By me.
Okay.
Until that whole thing kinda works itself out, I have a moral obligation to Ted.
You hands are so Soft for someone who does nothing but manual labor.
Thanks, I make sure to moisturize.
Mm, that's so important.
So important.
Listen I can wait.
Thank you.
- Uh huh.
- So um So, you look really good today.
Oh, hello, Roses.
What, are you here to tell me Alexis has skipped town with my lawn mower?
!
Roland, these people have literally hit rock bottom, they're not in the mood for your jokes right now.
She is.
Look, I've been on the phone all morning with missing persons, and just wondering if you've heard anything?
No.
Come in, come on in.
I can't imagine the stress of losing a child.
Oh, I haven't lost him, i know exactly where he is.
He's enjoying happy hour at the viceroy without me.
It's been three days without any contact.
Johnny, you wouldn't know this, but statistics tell us you have a 48 hour window before you can assume somebody is dead.
Yeah, I just said it's been three days.
Then do we call off the search?
Oh my God!
I'll get it.
Roland Schitt.
Yes.
Yes!
Yes!
Oh-oh.
Okay.
Uh-huh, yeah.
I'm good, how about you?
Terrific.
Great, where?
Uh-huh.
Uhhhh-huh!
I got it, great, we'll see you there this afternoon.
Bye.
Well, good news, folks!
They found the truck.
And David.
- Well, that didn't come up.
- Well, didn't you ask?
Johnny, they were all excited about telling me they found the truck, so - Call him back!
- Call him back.
Now!
Call him back!
Well, I I don't have the number, I've got the address.
I'm sure David is with the truck, right, Roland?
Well, I think they would've told me if there's a dead body with the truck, honey.
- Oh!
- Just give us the address!
Give me the address!
- Did they mention bags?
- Well, no talk of bags.
Were there bags in the truck?
My best friend in kindergarten ran away, and her parents didn't notice, and she ended up getting adopted by this really rich Asian family in Vancouver, but then they had their own kid, so she kind of got neglected a bit, and I can't remember whether she's back on the streets now, or You know, and he took his hair straightener, which he knows that i use more than he does.
This whole thing is just very selfish.
Alexis!
Ted!
Oh my God, hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Um I've been calling.
I know, I know.
But everything's just been so hectic, what with David missing, and like, I haven't been sleeping, and I haven't been eating, and You just ordered the parfait.
And I just keep picturing him at the bottom of a lake.
Oh, no, that guy was like, a known alcoholic, and they pulled him out a week ago.
Thank God you're here!
Of course, I've been trying to be here more for you, but I guess my texts haven't been getting through, or maybe I'm sending them wrong?
That's so sweet.
Uh, here.
Listen.
I don't want to apply any pressure to the whole marriage thing, but Thank you, Ted, 'cause it's so hard to focus on something like that right now.
And I totally understand that.
It's just you had said that you wanted to get married if you weren't leaving town, and you didn't leave town, so Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
And I totally get that.
Technically though, someone did leave, and so the dust just hasn't really settled on the whole us leaving thing.
- Yet.
- Right.
But obviously I want to be with you!
I'm just so scared.
What, about David, or about being with Yeah, that.
All we know is the truck ran out of gas on an amish farm.
So David has been living on an amish farm for three days?
We think so.
I really hope you're right.
Stevie dear, now don't take this the wrong way, but, is this car your home?
Excuse me?
I take it you're finished with this sandwich.
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks.
Oh yeah!
Um, but there's donuts under the seat, those are still good.
Oh.
Okay.
Alexis, we think we found your brother!
Come on!
I'm just super tired from walking, though.
Babe, you're tired because you were stressed about David, but they found him, you should go.
Alexis!
I know!
This is exactly what David wants.
All of us worried, and driving around in some tin can looking for him.
It's a tactic.
It's subterfuge.
Oh, you could be jumping to conclusions, Moira.
I taught him everything he knows.
He shouldn't have left me behind, that was never part of the plan.
Oh my God, ever since David left, you two have been so dramatic.
Do I have to remind you of the time that I was taken hostage on David geffen's yacht by Somali pirates for a week, and nobody answered my texts?
!
I had just had my eyelashes dyed, everything was cloudy!
Okay, can we all focus here?
For a moment?
!
David has spent the last three days on a farm.
With the amish!
Ugh!
Oh!
Thank God.
David!
David!
David, I'm here!
David, it's us!
I know!
David, come here, please!
Stop yelling, "David"!
You come here!
We've come to take you home!
Three days later!
Nobody knew where you were!
And your phone was off!
I texted Alexis!
Wha?
I'm sorry for not responding to like, one text, David!
I was worried sick, dear!
"Where's David, or his bags"?
- David?
- What?
!
- Okay, you remember Mutt?
- Yeah!
Okay, it's gotten more complicated!
What happened?
- We slept together!
- Ooh Okay Alexis, we can talk about this on the ride home.
David, let us help you with your bags!
What if I'm not ready to come home?
!
- There's a bug on your dress.
- Ew!
Ugh!
Oh!
Miriam makes the most delicious butter.
Yeah, I mean, she starts pounding that cream about a half hour too early in the morning, but it tastes exactly like the butter we had at the Ritz in Paris, you know, that sort of Salt-less butter.
Well, once again, thank you for nurturing our David during such a difficult time.
Well, we should be thanking you for coming.
We've spent two sleepless nights, wondering what would happen if nobody came.
Would we be stuck with him?
!
Oh, my baby!
Thank you, thank you!
I would give you a gratuity, but I'm short about a million this week.
David's stay here has taught us some valuable lessons - in patience, forgiveness - Restraint.
Well it seems you've taken very good care of our possessions, I hope it wasn't too much of an imposition.
You know, I'm not sure I'm even ready to come home yet.
And yet your time with us has come to an end.
Okay.
These three days you spent with us David, will remain in our memories for many days, and many, many, many nights.
Thank you for your kindness, when no one else showed me kindness.
And compassion, when no one else showed Excuse me son, uh I imagine it's customary for strangers to partake in a good, old fashioned amish lunch?
Not always.
Have a safe trip.
Oh!
Okay.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Yeah, thank-thank you.
Where are we?
Do you know how many times I've had to apologize to Roland?
You can't just leave with other people's trucks, David!
What were you thinking?
What you did was impulsive, capricious and melodramatic.
But it was also wrong.
Okay, nobody freaked out when Alexis went missing!
I didn't go missing, David.
The FBI knew where I was the entire time.
All right listen, the important thing is, we have David back, we have your bag back, and here we are, all together.
What bag?
You stole my bag, David.
That bag?
That bag looks like it hasn't been used in a hundred years, so I put my toiletries in it.
Why would you think that i would steal that bag?
I don't know David, why did you steal my eyeliner?
That was a phase in high school!
Now, did you come for me, or did you come for that bag?
- This was my grandmother's bag!
- We came for you!
I hitchhiked, in the middle of the night, wearing all black!
I was basically asking to get hit by a car!
Why?
You told me that Diane Sawyer gave you that bag, and that it was fake.
I didn't want you taking it.
Okay, because I have told a lot of people that Diane Sawyer sells fake bags on the down-low.
I slept in the cab of a truck!
Overnight!
Oh my God, who hasn't, David!
Hmm.
- Hi.
- What can I - How are-yeah.
- What?
Um I come bearing gifts.
Oh, how generous of you.
I think your car might need a bit of a clean.
Is that a dead squirrel on your hood?
They said that you have been calling around, asking for me, which i thought was very nice of you.
Oh, well, I didn't.
Hmm, well, they said that you were.
Well, they were mistaken.
Oh, okay.
In fact, I was hoping you wouldn't come back.
Wow, believe it or not, that is one of the warmest welcomes I have received so far!
Usually when you tell someone that you have feelings for them, and the next thing they do is drive out of town with no plan to return, you hope you never have to see them again.
Well, in my defense, um I was intending on staying away for much longer, but I ran out of money, and forgot my phone charger.
Oh, well, at least you were well intentioned.
It's not like I didn't think about what you said.
Um, after we spoke, I thought, well, there goes my one friend.
Try saying that one out loud, it is very dark.
Well We will just have to work through this, won't we?
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Yeah, um, if that's what you- if that's what you want, then yes, I would like that very much.
So um, I guess just tell me what you would like me to do, and I will do it.
Okay, well, let's start by you leaving my office, and we'll see where that takes us.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I'll just I'm gonna leave your office.
I'm gonna leave your - I'm gonna leave your office.
So um Best wishes to you.
Warmest regards.
Okay, you're saying this was circulated around town?
This was before my nose job, how was anyone supposed to recognize me?
Oh David, it's a rare gift to strip vanity of its charm, - yet here you are.
- Yeah!
Oh, fuhhh Hello, Roses!
Oh, can this not wait 'til after breakfast, please?
Well, this will only take a second.
David!
I'm so glad to see you back home, all safe and sound.
Thanks.
Hmm.
And I don't want you to worry, I'm not gonna press charges, okay?
Next time, someone will think twice before they steal my truck, yes?
Ooh, burn, David!
Shhh!
David, don't you um, have anything you wanna say to Roland?
Uh !
Uh, I'm sorry for taking your truck without permission.
Um It was a bad mistake, and it won't happen again.
Oh my God, um And I feel really bad about it.
But do you, David?
All right, all right, all right, I accept your apology.
Thank you.
- Yeah!
- Okay, now let's talk about gas.
I'm thinking thirty cents on the mile.
I think we're done here, Roland!
- Okay I'm taking your juice.
- David!
Okay, next Now's the time to sprinkle in the chili pepper flakes.
We've already done that.
What number are we on?
Oh my God!
Is this not your mother's recipe?
Yes, and now I'm passing it on to you.
So try to keep up.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Someone keeps eating my yogurt!
- Arghhhh!
- What kind of yogurt?
I was saving that for after my run, David!
Oh my God, I guess I was saving it for during your run, then.
Agh, you're like a big, dirty raccoon, David!
Oh Alexis, you're almost forty, if you want some food, prepare yourself some food!
There is no food!
Nobody can cook, this is basically child abuse!
David can cook.
I can't cook.
You got that Teppanyaki table for your bar mitzvah.
That was thrown out after Alexis left her extensions on it, and everything smelled like burnt hair.
I thought it was an actual table, David.
There was a plug coming out of the side of it!
Well, Alexis, why don't you cook, you can cook.
- Yeah.
- I can't cook!
Why don't you cook?
Well, I-I could I-I could cook.
Oh, John, John!
This is embarrassing!
Fine, I'll cook dinner tonight.
What was the chicken dish that Adelina used to make?
Mm!
The enchiladas.
- Yeah!
- Uh huh.
Oh, Adelina, she was a good cook, remember?
Mm!
Uh huh!
Yeah!
Mmm!
Excuse me, but the enchiladas were my mother's recipe.
I don't think so.
Um, that's not how I remember it.
I made it for you all the time!
- John?
!
- Yes, well, if that's the way you remember things, sweetheart, that's Okay, enough, tonight I will make my mother's enchiladas.
And David, you will help me.
Uh, what?
!
Oh my gosh David, it's gonna be so fun - for you tonight, doing that with Mom.
- Don't touch me!
- It's so nice!
- Don't!
That's harassment!
Well, there she is!
- Hi.
- How are you today, Jocelyn?
Oh, I'm okay, busy, I mean, we were about - to head to, um - How fun.
Listen, a small favour I require the use of your kitchen.
Sorry, for what?
To cook a meal, of course.
Oh Moira, normally I'd be happy to, it's just we have a really hectic afternoon, so David and I are going to resurrect an old family recipe.
Mmm!
Of course I'd say yes, it's just that that darn stove is on the fritz.
Oh really, honey?
Because this pie is scorching!
It comes and goes, Roland!
Oh, I'm sure it's far superior to what we have at the motel.
David and I will manage!
Oh, I know, it's-it's just that I called the repairman, and so he's coming this afternoon.
- Oh.
- Who'd you call, honey?
Bill?
- Yeah Bill.
- Bill doesn't do stoves.
Then, Gary.
Gary?
Our dentist?
?
I don't remember who I called but, they're coming, this afternoon!
Oh.
It's as if you don't trust David and me to fend for ourselves in your kitchen.
Oh no, we don't mind you using our kitchen, as long as you make extra for us, and leave a ten spot over there for the hydro.
That I can do!
I'll be back in ten, to a clean kitchen!
- A clean kitchen.
- I just cleaned the kitchen!
How's the brisket, Mr. Rose?
Well, it's tasting more like meat.
Oh, well that's good!
You know Twyla, I've been noticing how quiet it is in here during the day.
Oh yeah, it's always quiet before the lunch rush.
Which isn't so much a rush as much as it is just a A handful of people showing up at a leisurely pace.
Oh, yeah, well, the reason I point it out is that um, you know, I've been looking for a place to work.
- Like a-an office space.
- Uh-huh.
You see, I get a lot of ideas back at the motel that need serious contemplation, but with the family there, I just can't seem to get any work done.
- I hear that.
- So, I was wondering And I thought about bringing this up the other day, but decided against it, for some reason.
But here we are talking, so, what the hell.
What are the chances of me operating out of one of these booths every day?
I am just gonna put these plates down.
I just think I'll think better, once the blood rushes from my arms, back to my head.
Oh, oh!
Yes, yes, yes!
Uh, absolutely!
Yeah, you can put them down, I didn't mean to keep you, there.
I know you've got a lot of work to do.
Totally, they're just heavy plates!
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
Okay.
Hey there, Johnny.
Oh, Bob, hi!
Oh, I didn't see you there.
I hope you don't mind me uh, eavesdropping on your conversation, but uh, I think maybe I could help you.
- Really?
- I heard you're looking for office space?
- Yes!
- Well, I have a sweet little spot you might be interested in, if uh, if you wanna take a look.
Yes, I would!
Thank you.
Happy to help, I'm sure you'd do the same for me.
If you had anything to offer.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Is this a safe space yet, for us?
Or Yeah, why wouldn't it be?
Oh, okay, it's just 'cause the last time I was in here, you told me to leave your office, so, I guess I was just having a hard time gauging where we're at, as two people who used to um be well, um How can I help you?
I-I'm wondering if I can borrow your vehicle?
I need to get some groceries.
Sure.
Do you want a lift?
Is that a trick question?
- No.
- Oh, okay.
Um You don't have to keep tiptoeing around me.
- I'm over it.
- Over it?
Yeah, I don't like you anymore.
I mean, like that.
Oh!
Okay.
Well, that's good then, I guess.
I think so.
- Are you wearing makeup?
- So what if I am?
Hey!
Uh, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Uh no, no, of course not.
Okay.
Um So I've been thinking a lot about things.
Okay, good, because I've been thinking a lot about things, too.
- Like your proposal.
- Yeah, the more I thought about it, the more it just didn't feel right.
Yes!
I agree!
Yeah, it came out of the blue, and you had a lot on your mind.
Yes, Ted, yes!
So I think it may be best for us just to Take some time, you know?
Oh my God, it's like we're sharing a brain!
Then in a few weeks, when we're settled, and more focused on each other, we try the whole proposal thing again.
Hmm?
Mmm-hmm Unless you were gonna say something else?
No!
'Cause you and me You and I No, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!
It's-mmm!
So uh-us, the "us" thing, and Um Whoa!
So uh, what do you think, Johnny?
What do I think?
I think it's a nice garage.
- Where's the office?
- You're looking at it.
Bob, you told me you had a sweet little office space, okay, and frankly, working out of a garage is not what I had in mind.
Well uh, out of curiosity, what did you have in mind?
An office!
You know, a chair, for starters!
Oh, well, we got a uh, I got a great spot for a chair right there, uh, you just have to move these tires.
Um, filing those papers'll give you some extra space.
Yeah, Bob, I'm not working for you, I'm not filing papers.
No, I'm just saying, if you need to get a chair in here, you know, you might have to move some things, maybe, you know, sell some old car parts.
Yeah, I didn't come here looking for a job.
Okay?
I wanted a space to work, and frankly I don't think this is it.
Okay, well uh, I'm not saying you have to make a decision right now, just maybe clean it up, and give it a think.
How about I give it a think without cleaning it up!
Suit yourself.
As long as it gets cleaned up at some point.
Okay, Bob Uh, I'm gonna leave you with your thoughts.
- Hey!
- What's up?
Mm, uh well, good news, I um I finally went over to break up with Ted.
Ooh, that is good!
I was starting to think you might never do it.
I know, I know.
It must've been hard.
It was, it was really hard.
How'd he take it?
Um, I don't know, you never know with these things.
So ooh!
- Alexis?
- What's up?
You didn't break up with Ted, did you?
Um, well, like I said, I started to, and then, I don't know if it was the timbre of his voice, or the fact that he smelled like baby powder, but I just, I physically couldn't do it!
- Okay.
- Yeah.
You know, there was It must happen to people, right?
Like, there must be people out there who say yes to getting married because they can't say no, and then what happens?
And then they're just stuck for the rest of their life, with the same wrong, sweet, person, right?
Well, I'm pretty sure those people get divorced.
Aaah!
Alexis, you need to be honest with him.
Okay.
What if I sent him the sweetest little text message?
Okay.
Yeah.
I'll do it in person.
Obviously, I'm just I'm gonna do it in person.
I will do this in person!
Well, that was quick.
It was a pretty short grocery list.
No, I mean, you being "over it".
I knew what you meant.
It's just a really fast turnaround.
You know, usually it doesn't happen that quickly.
What if it does?
Well, it's just when someone keeps telling you that they're over it, sometimes it means that they're not actually over it, which is fine!
But it's fine too if they are over it.
Yeah, I just wanna make sure that you're taking the time to actually get over it, you know, because if you don't, I think it could lead to just You know, it's interesting, the longer we have this conversation, the more over it I get.
- Oh!
- In fact, I'm having a hard time remembering when I wasn't over it.
Wow, well aren't you just a A pillar of strength, and self-healing.
Yeah, I'm pretty amazing.
- Uh huh.
- You really missed out.
- Oh, did I?
- 'Cause, you know, - I'm over it.
- You're over it!
Yep.
Yeah, you made that abundantly clear.
So Okay, a quarter cup at a time.
A thin stream, it's supposed to be a thin stream, - and blend it really well.
- Uh huh.
Uh huh.
Or you'll burn it David, that's not right!
Okay well, that's because I'm ladling and stirring at the same time, and you're just standing there.
Now is not the time to lose focus, darling.
This was your idea!
You're the one who allegedly made the enchiladas.
Yes, so try to keep up.
Okay, next.
Now's the time to sprinkle in the chili pepper flakes.
We've already done that.
What number are we on?
!
Oh my God, is this not your mother's recipe?
Yes, and now I'm passing it on to you!
So try to keep up.
Um oh!
Next step is to fold in the cheese.
What does that mean?
What does "fold in the cheese" mean?
- You fold it in.
- I understand that, but how?
How do you fold it?
Do you fold it in half, like a piece of paper, and drop it in the pot, or, what do you do?
David, I cannot show you everything.
Okay, well, can you show me one thing?
!
You just here's what you do: You just fold it in.
Okay, I don't know how to fold broken cheese like that!
Then I don't know how to be any clearer!
You take that thing that's in your hand, - Uh huh?
- And you If you say "fold in" one more time It says, fold it in!
This is your recipe!
You fold in the cheese, then!
- Don't you dare!
- You fold it in!
David!
Oh good, now I see bubbles.
David!
What does burning smell like?
!
All right, here we go.
Ohhh!
Hey.
Wow, twice in the same day, what'd I do to deserve this?
Um, I was hoping we could talk again.
Oh, well, I was about to give Hazel a blood test.
Well, I think it's probably better if you put Hazel down.
What?
!
No, she'll be fine!
- It's just her blood sugar!
- No, no, no, no, no!
I just mean while we talk, I think it would be Um, easier.
Oh, okay.
There we go.
Okay.
So, I did something.
I didn't do something, I should've done something.
And I didn't.
What didn't you do?
Um, I wasn't direct with people.
People who deserve more directness.
People like you.
Well, that was pretty direct.
People like you deserve better than people like me.
You're the perfect boyfriend, Ted.
- Thank you - But I knew there was a "but".
No, no, no!
There is no "but".
But you're just not the perfect boyfriend for me.
And I don't-i don't think that I'm in this enough to take it to the next level.
Okay.
Okay.
So that does mean that I don't think that I can accept, your proposal.
Yeah, no, I pieced that part together.
Okay.
But um Thank you.
- For what?
- Well, I wouldn't want to marry someone who didn't feel about me the same way that I feel about them.
Oh wow, could you make this any harder?
Well, I did book us a two week couples vacation that's non-refundable.
Ooh, yeah, that makes That makes it harder.
Hi Bob, what's uh, going on?
Johnny, what are you doing here?
Well, I just came by to talk to you about the office space.
It's funny to hear that, because before you were saying this isn't office space.
And uh, well, I got to thinking, well, if it's not office space, then, what the heck is it?
!
And then I remembered Gwen's nephew, Eric, here, was looking for studio space.
Uh, he draws Chinese cartoons.
They're Japanese graphic novels.
It's called Manga.
Oh, well, that sounds like a Lucrative career choice.
So anyway Bob, I've decided to take this space for my office, so.
Ooh, now this is a bit awkward, because you gave me the distinct impression that you didn't want it.
And now we uh, have Eric here.
Yeah, well, Eric can find a you know, a back room, or a dark basement to doodle in.
Well, that's okay, Uncle Bob.
I don't have any money.
Either does Johnny, and he's not even related to me.
No, but you said Eric was Gwen's nephew, so technically he's not related to you, either.
So no offense, Eric.
No, that's fair.
Oh.
Well, uh All right, Johnny, uh, I guess just let me know when you've finished cleaning up, and uh, I'll find something else for you to do.
Bob, I don't work for you, I'm just setting up an office!
No, I know, it's your space.
And uh, just so you know, garage opens at eight, but if you're here a few minutes before that, even better!
How did it go?
You smell the room, what do you think?
I-I don't know.
Well, of course you don't, because I have not taught you life's basic skills.
Other than cooking, what basic life skills don't I have?
Oh David, I'm not sure we have time for that.
You know, when I was a young girl, my sister and I baked bread from scratch, in a kitchen half this size.
Do I wanna hear this story?
I could make a bed, I could fix a wobbly table, or start a car without a key.
Then I met your father, and suddenly I had people to do everything for me.
And I assumed that I would maintain my proficiencies, should I ever, God forbid, need them.
But no, I have lost all my skills.
And now I know how it feels to be utterly helpless, like you, and your sister.
I don't know if I'd call us "helpless".
No need to make me feel better.
Anyway, I um I found something.
David, that's your cell phone!
Um you might wanna press play on my cell phone.
Just press "Folding" is one of the easiest techniques in the book.
It's just a very gentle way of combining two ingredients.
See what I'm doing?
Well, that's simple enough, any fool could do that.
- Did you do that?
!
- No.
Folding is most often used in baking - Oh, Mr. Rose.
- Oh, hi there, Ted.
I was just dropping off some stuff for Alexis.
Oh.
You wanna come in?
Uh, I think it's best if I don't.
Oh.
- Oh - Yeah.
We broke up.
Yeah, I I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, me too.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
Good.
Okay, that's okay.
I'm sorry, it's just She really made a mark on me, you know?
And it's rare to find someone that beautiful, and smart, and deeply selfish, yet charming!
Yeah, I know, I know.
Well, you'll bounce back, you'll bounce back because you're a fine young man.
You're a fine young man, and Yeah, yeah.
I think I just Need to get away for a little while.
You know, clear my head a bit.
Yeah, well, that looks like that might be a good idea.
Well, this looks delicious!
I see someone decided on a new dish.
Nope, these are the enchiladas.
Yeah well, they kinda smell like enchiladas, so We had lots of fun making them.
Mm!
Let's not ruin a meal by talking about the process!
Well, fair enough.
Hey, I for one, cannot wait to dig in!
Hmm!
Mmm!
Not bad.
Not bad, you two!
Not bad at all!
Mm it's creamy.
- Very creamy.
- Mm!
Thank you, Alexis.
Well, this could be a very good thing!
I think maybe once, or twice a week This won't be happening again.
Uh-uh.
Although it's really not that complicated, - once you fold in the cheese!
- Ahh Alexis hasn't been here for a week and a half.
I had breakfast with her just yesterday.
That was me.
We had a lengthy conversation about hosiery and menopause.
Again, that was me.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 David!
Alexis!
Time to leave for breakfast.
Honestly David, why are you not ready?
I'm not going.
How is it that a moth can find its way into a triple locked titanium suitcase?
!
The perils of owning cashmere.
Alexis!
Please, dear!
Alexis hasn't been here for a week and a half.
She's at Mutt's.
Well, that's simply not true.
I had breakfast with her just yesterday.
That was me!
We had a lengthy conversation about hosiery and menopause.
Again, that was me.
Hello?
Anyone here?
Oh, hey.
Could I get you to take a quick look at my muffler?
Oh, I'm - I'm sorry, I don't work here.
Oh, that's 'cause you're behind the desk, and everything.
Oh yeah, no, I mean I "work" here, but I don't actually work "here " in the garage.
I mean, I am working, here in the garage, but I don't work for the garage.
I'm So you don't know anything about mufflers?
'cause I think it's just a loose connection on the bottom.
Yeah, Bob will be back in a minute, and I think that's your best bet, Just you know, 'cause he comes and goes, and Okay, well, maybe I'll just go to another garage.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, sorry, I uh, couldn't help.
Hey Johnny, I just went out and got me a muffin.
Bob, a customer was just in here, and he was saying he had a problem with a muffler.
Oh yeah?
What uh, what'd it end up being?
Well, I don't know, I didn't go out and look!
- Oh?
- I'm not a mechanic!
Well, I don't expect you to know everything, but you know, if a client of yours came in here, I'd certainly talk to them.
Well, I hope you wouldn't.
Well, not that I have to worry, I know you're a little low on clients.
That's because I'm building a business, Bob.
And right now I'm in strategy mode, looking for opportunities, and eventually I will implement a plan.
Well, if you feel like uh, you might like to implement a muffler, be my guest.
Because I can't afford to lose any customers right now, Johnny, Especially ah, when I'm giving away free office space.
Question.
The cedar planks out behind the motel, are they being used for something, or are they up for grabs?
How do you know it's cedar?
Um, I bought a cologne once, in Japan, that's supposed to smell like the aftermath of a car crashing into a cedar tree.
Why would anyone wanna smell like that?
- Hmm?
- You know what?
Never mind, the cedar is yours.
Thank you so much.
Um, If I may, what are you planning on doing with a pile of wood?
Oh.
Um A family of moths seem to have mistaken my cashmere sweaters for an Atlantic City all-you-can-eat buffet.
And I plan on putting a stop to that.
So I'm building a cedar chest for my knits.
You're planning on building a cedar chest?
That's correct.
You are.
- You're gonna build it?
- It's a box!
So you're just nailing some planks of wood together.
Anyway, if you've seen the state of my sweaters, you'd know that I have very little choice in the matter.
- So thank you.
- Okay well, don't let me stand in the way of your handiwork!
- Mhmm.
- May the force be with you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, genuinely.
Honestly, you're so great.
Oh, Twyla Twyla!
Twyla!
Uh, be right there, Mrs. Rose.
- Hi, Moira!
- Hello, everyone.
Hey.
- I'll see you guys later.
- Yeah, see you at two.
Yeah.
Sorry about that, I wasnât sure whether you were waiting for your family, or a friend No, just an intimate breakfast, nothing special, no big "ladies' bruncheon" for me.
Ladies' bruncheon?
Well, whatever that was.
A gathering of the girls, I - Oh, you mean the Jazzagals.
- I do?
Yeah, the Jazzagals is our singing group.
A singing group?
What fun.
Yeah, Jocelyn started it a few years ago, and it's been great.
We even went to New York once.
Oh, a trip to the big city.
How grand!
Let me guess, a bucket of shrimp in Times Square, followed by a "Lion King" matinee!
No, actually, we performed in Central Park.
C-Central Park?
Really?
Yeah!
For the "Little Towns, Big Voices" Festival.
You do realize I am a professional vocalist.
Oh, really?
I thought you were in like, a soap opera.
Oh, I didn't know you were a fan, thank you!
My roots are in the theater.
Especially musicals.
Anything "Andy" Webber!
Wow!
So did you record an album?
Oh, yes, you'll find me on ensemble tracks seven, nine, and thirteen of the original cast recording of Starlight "Starlight Express".
Well, then you should definitely talk to Jocelyn!
She would love to have you in the group.
Or perhaps Jocelyn should speak to me.
Yeah.
Menu?
Yes please, I'm still not quite off book.
Aaah!
Uh huh?
Uh, hey, I just came by for Alexis, she wanted me to grab some uh - Cute looks for - Cute looks for the barn?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, in the closet.
Everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just um I'm just doing some measurements, I'm measuring something, so.
- Why don't you use a measuring tape?
- Ah, because we don't have one.
- Did you ask Stevie if maybe the motel has one?
- Um yeah, I haven't got I hadn't thought of I didn't think of that.
- So what are you measuring, exactly?
- Um It's a really tragic story, involving some damaged luxury cashmere.
And so I am building a cedar chest for my sweaters.
So I'm just measuring how big to make the chest.
- Well, I've built a chest before.
- Yeah?
And I have some time, um Do you want some help?
You know what?
That could be good.
Well, how far along are you?
Um, I'm this far.
I can't come in, But I do have some good news.
That's great.
What's your news?
Well, a little bird chirped in my ear about your singing group.
Oh, you mean the Jazzagals.
Yes, at first I wondered aloud why would a competitive vocal group not reach out to a trained chanteuse?
Oh, we're just a group of gals.
Exactly, that's the answer.
Small minds don't reach for the stars.
No more!
Not on my watch.
Jocelyn, I am here!
You wanna audition for the Jazzagals?
Au-Audition!
Uh, though I'm sure you mean no offense, in the actual world of entertainment, I'm what's known as, "offer only".
Moira, I know you're a great singer, everybody has to audition, and I can't have you not audition, it would open up a whole can of worms, I mean, even Gwen had to audition, and she was in a regional production of "Annie".
Who hasn't been?
Listen, we would love to have you, you think about it.
Okay Bob?
You've got a customer!
Bob!
Yeah, the owner's just stepped out, uh, but, maybe I can help you?
Hey.
Has Paul Bunion finished his box?
Who?
I'm going to need some things for the chest.
Like the number for a carpenter?
Like, a work bench, a miter saw, two bar clamps, and some dowels.
Okay do you know how to use a miter saw?
Um, no.
Mutt is out back, and he's asked me to get these things for him.
Um, we're building the chest together.
So Wow, this whole thing just got a lot weirder.
There's a tool shed out back, the other side of the motel.
- Okay.
- Will you be requiring a tool box?
Maybe?
Um, let's go with yes, just to be safe.
Will you be needing your basic toolbox, or your "cedar chest" tool box?
Obviously the cedar chest tool box!
Oh, that's in the shed.
It's a big wooden box, with the words, "tools to make a cedar chest" carved into the side of it, so it's really clear Okay, I'm assuming you're kidding.
Um But in the off chance that you're not, where in the shed would I find that box?
You're kidding.
And she did what she had to do She called every angel Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah To rearrange the stars So that each and every woman Could find the perfect guy Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga Oh, it's raining men!
Yes!
Bravo!
Bravo!
- Moira!
- Hello, you.
- Hi!
- Sorry for interrupting.
I just-I just thought I'd stop by, I was in the neighbourhood.
Maybe I should showcase my talents, I thought, for the group.
Oh, that's great.
Great, you can call it an audition if you must, or an impromptu performance, or perhaps "An Evening with " That all sounds amazing.
We're just finishing up a rehearsal, we just have to work out a couple of rough spots in Lena's solo, and then you can have the floor.
I'll wait, far be it for me to get in the way of you making any necessary improvements.
Okay, so we're almost there, let's just work out some of those little rough spots.
- Okay?
- Okay.
So let's take it from "For tonight, for the first time".
Okay.
Okay, okay.
'Cause tonight for the first time Just about half past ten For the first time Hey, Johnny.
Keepin' busy, or uh hardly workin'?
Well, first of all Bob, that's not the expression.
Um, take a seat.
If I may, an observation?
To run a business, you have to be here to run the business.
You have to be here to deal with your clients.
That's what I've been doing all afternoon.
You got some clients, that's great news!
No, I was dealing with your customers!
Well, thank you, Johnny, That's a refreshing change of attitude.
Bob, you're never here!
And while you were gone, I helped a customer fill his tire with air, I helped an elderly woman add oil to her car, and I sold the '93 Buick for $350 dollars.
You've got to be here to run your business!
Whoa, you have been busy!
Listen, uh tell me just a little more about selling that Buick.
Well, it's a funny story.
This guy came in supposedly for directions.
Okay, but anyone with a background in sales could see how he was eyeballing that Buick.
So I slow play it.
I pretend I don't notice.
And then he sort of mentions the Buick.
So I hem and haw, textbook stuff, I tell him, you know, oh, there's a lot of interest in that particular vehicle.
You know, I'm playing the guy like a bow fiddle.
Then he finally admits this is the kind of car that he's been looking for.
Oh, really?
Says I. That's when I go in for the kill.
Long story short, he forks over $350 dollars cash.
And you're welcome.
Certain instincts you just don't lose.
It's like riding a bike.
Well, funny you should use that expression.
Because Dick Sinson is gonna be riding his bike until we can get his car back for him!
- Who's Dick Simpson?
- I couldn't tell 'ya.
But Dick Sinson is the fella whose car you just sold.
He brought it in for a brake job.
I don't recall him wanting to sell it.
Oh.
Oh, poor Dick.
He loved that car.
It was a gift from the church.
He and his family hit on some hard times, and uh Yeah, you know what, Bob?
I'll tell 'ya, I will call Mr. Stinson, and apologize.
Well, you can apologize to Mr. Stinson until the cows come home, but I don't see how that is gonna help Dick Sinson!
I'll fix it, Bob!
Here's hopin'.
Ridiculous name!
Sin-Sinson Sinson!
Dick Sin-Sinson!
Ahh we just need to wait for the glue to dry, - it shouldn't take too long.
- This is really nice of you.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, well, I can't not jump in and help when I see someone doin' something wrong.
Was it wrong, or was it just unconventional?
No, it was wrong.
Okay, well, I'm not gonna argue with you, 'cause I need you to keep working, we're in too deep.
Uh, does Alexis know about this?
Yeah definitely.
But can I tell you something?
But you gotta promise not to tell Alexis.
Okay, um If you're experiencing feelings for me, Like, I totally get it.
And normally I'd be into it, I've just been down this road before, and it's-it's messy.
- No, it's about Alexis.
- I see, okay.
Um, well, you know, uh what is it?
She slept over like a week and a half ago, and she hasn't left.
- Uh huh.
- I mean, don't get me wrong, I love having her there at night, - if you know what I mean.
- Yeah, I do, yeah.
It's just the days, they've gotten a bit um Suffocating?
I just think that a little space is a healthy thing.
Mhmm, it is, totally.
I mean, I've been enjoying it a lot, so.
And I live alone, and now someone is there all the time.
- Which is great.
- Uh huh.
But just not every day.
And I just don't know what to say.
Well, she sort of fades into the background after a while, you know, like a smoke alarm.
Are you just saying that because you don't want her - to move back here?
- Yes, I am!
You just take some time, you know?
Carve out some time in a day to just escape.
You know, do what you wanna do.
It's the only thing that'll keep you sane.
Because no, you can't mention any of this to her, she'd lose her mind.
Yeah It's raining men Every specimen Yeah, almost there!
- Okay.
- Really good though, yeah.
Okay Moira, you're up.
I just noticed the time, wow.
And you're all very busy, so why don't we reschedule this for two weeks from now, when you're all more prepared.
Oh no, we were done early, we got plenty of time.
Thank you, but I think I'm fighting a little bug.
Come on Moira, audition!
I would love to learn from a professional singer.
- Really?
- Or we could just all go home early.
Come on, Moira!
- Moi-ra!
Moi-ra!
- Stop!
Moi-ra!
Moi-ra!
Moi-ra!
Moi-ra!
That's cruel!
Well, I can't say no to anyone!
Someone held me all night long It should've been you Someone's arms were big and strong It's should've been you It's-I-a wah!
I warned you I was lonely But you didn't seem to care No no no That you could've been - do do But you dah dah heed a woman's tears Woo Doo Someone loved me all night long It should have been should've been you!
You!
That's the end.
Oh, that was different.
Thank you.
Well, thank you, I'll leave you to discuss.
What's going on?
Um, I'm gonna sleep here tonight.
Oh, is everything okay?
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?
Well, it's just that you've been spending a lot of time at Mutt's.
Yeah, I know, and I actually had to talk to him about that.
Oh, you did?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Um, like, he brought all my stuff back, and I was like, this is great, but then at the same time I was just kinda like, I feel like I need my space right now.
Yeah, and that's something that you said to him.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we were chatting, and I was just like, I feel like I need to spend a few days - back at the motel.
- Yeah That's-again, that's You said that?
Yeah, that's what we were talking about.
Oh, okay.
Um and how did he take that?
Um, well, I mean, I was kinda worried about telling him.
I'm sure.
Uh huh.
Because I didn't want I didn't wanna hurt him, and I didn't want him to worry, like, oh my God, is he breaking up with me?
Is she breaking up with me?
Right, yeah, 'cause we wouldn't want him to worry about that.
- Yeah, exactly.
- Mhmm.
So but I'm really glad that I told him, and he took it really, really well.
- So - That's excellent.
Yep.
That's a cute little wood thing, David.
Thank you, I made it.
It did seem like a few of them might've had some training, but what I bring is a certain sophistication, improvisation, showmanship!
I'm sure you wowed them, honey.
Oh John, there were definitely lots of surprised looks.
Well, they've probably never heard the real deal.
I suppose!
Oh John, it felt so good to be working the old muscles again!
Riding the melody, bending the notes!
Well, they must've enjoyed it sweetheart, if they asked you to join.
Mm!
I know!
I only wish you could've been there, John.
It would've been so nice to have you to sing to.
Well, I'm sorry I missed it.
In your dreams I'll soon caress your Mmpph mmpph In your dreams I'll huzzle lovingly Sweetheart.
Boncha boom da da Between you and me Honey?
I was older darling dream with me
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
David?
David, what is this?
!
It looks like a bike.
Is it yours?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
David, what is this doing here?
You might wanna read the note.
No, is it from Mutt?
David!
No!
No!
I feel like he really gets you.
Like, I feel like he sees like, deep into your soul.
I'm not quite sure what he's seeing exactly, but there's definitely - he's looking inward.
- What am I gonna do?
!
- About what?
This is serious, David!
This is so off base!
Arghh!
My God, imagine what kind of ring he'd buy!
Like an opal, or something.
Ooh, like a pear-shaped opal.
Hello, is anybody home?
No, Mutt!
Hey, you have to support me in this.
- Mhmm.
- You have to, do you promise me?
Oh yeah, of course.
- So - Hey you!
This is so special for me.
Well, I thought you needed a new mode of transportation.
I do!
I do need a mode of transportation!
And like, a car would be nice, but, do I need a car?
Not anymore, it appears.
Well, you said you missed spin class, so I did!
I did say that I missed spin class.
And so you bought me a bike!
Because I said that I missed spin class.
Because you're so thoughtful and perceptive.
- So you like it?
- Mm, I'd say she loves it.
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you're gonna need this.
A helmet!
It came with the bike.
I think you should put it on.
Like, I think you should actually like, - like, put the helmet on.
- Yeah.
And I will one day, when we take this little pony for a joyride!
Actually, I brought my bike, so we can test it out.
I thought maybe we could take a little ride to the cafe.
Ah!
So fun.
I hate you, David!
See 'ya!
What about lamps?
The lamps at the motel have those uh Little bulbs, these are old-fashioned big bulb lamps.
I don't see any bulbs here.
No there aren't, but the point is, we can get big bulbs if we have big bulb lamps.
Oh John, I don't know.
Lamps, clothing, jewelry Look at this poor woman's life strewn across cheap folding tables.
John, do you think they did this with our things?
No, not ours, no.
They put our stuff right on the lawn.
Strangers picking through precious pieces we owned!
I know, and judging us, like we're judging this poor woman.
Well, except they'd have been saying, "what great taste they had"!
I wonder who got my golf clubs.
Really, John, that's the first thing that comes to mind?
They were custom made.
So was my Galapagonian tortoise-shell foot bath.
And now some lonely hoarder is letting his cats poop in it.
Well, they were just things, Moira, just things.
Yeah, designer, one-of-a-kind things.
Yeah, sleek, oak-trimmed, leather interior, - German-engineered things.
- Oh!
Shopping used to cheer me up.
Big bulbs is not doing it for me.
Oh God.
- Roland!
- Sure, I'll come in, but just for a second.
Ahem!
Huh!
Can I help you with something?
Well um, here's the deal: Uh, I was thinking this morning, and I don't wanna tell you where I was thinking, but it was a small room in my house, - and I was sitting down - Okay.
And I was thinking to myself, who can I trust to help me pick out a woman's blouse?
And you know whose name came to mind?
I don't-i don't know, Rachel Zoe?
Yours!
I don't know how to take that.
- It's for Jocelyn.
- Mm!
And you know, I would do it myself, it's just that you know, shopping, I mean, you go in, you get - You know, look at the stuff on the racks, - Uh huh and you pick out, you know, the color that you like, and then you try it on and make sure it fits you, - Right.
- and then you buy it and you You're just describing what shopping is.
Yes, and normally I'm fine with that, it's just I'm looking for something a little fancy here.
A little um, stylish.
A little elegant.
- Ah - You know?
And who knows elegance better than you, pal?
I mean, you're the only elegant guy I know!
So you're looking for me to style Jocelyn?
Well, actually, this is supposed to be a surprise.
So I was kinda thinking that maybe um, you and me could just go out and do a little uh, shopping together on the down low.
Y-yeah yeah, that um No, we could to that, we could do that at some point.
Oh, great!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good, that's terrific.
So then, whenever's good for you.
Okay, great.
So you wanna-so you wanna go now?
It's a little time sensitive, that's the only thing.
Yeah, okay, well, I take it you have measurements, and a mood board, then?
The whole purpose of having a bike might be to actually ride the bike.
Yeah, I'm just not wearing the right outfit.
It's a five minute ride.
Yeah, so by the time we get on, and then we get off, it's almost not worth it.
Do you not like the bike?
No, I love it!
It's just that, um, there are so many drunk drivers around here.
It's 10:00am.
Mutt, you tell that to an alcoholic!
Is it the color?
Because I mean, - it's totally fixable!
- Okay, fine.
I don't know how to ride a bike.
- What?
- I said, I don't know how to ride a bike!
Ugh!
Moira, look at these cufflinks.
Oh John, we're better off stealing cutlery from the cafe!
No, these look like sterling.
I'm gonna bid on these.
Hey there, Roses!
- Oh, hi.
- Oh hey, Jocelyn.
Look at you two bargain hunters.
You finding anything yet?
Mm, nothing you couldn't see fall out of a common Christmas cracker!
I think half the fun is panning for nuggets - at these things.
- Ooh, look at that mattress!
Well, there you go, what a find.
Poor dear, enchanted by a death bed.
This is a brand new mattress, it's still in the plastic!
- What?
!
- Yeah!
And it's memory foam!
This must've cost a fortune!
Well, you're just gonna have to bid on it.
John, why didn't you see that mattress first?
!
That's something we could actually use!
- I'll use the cufflinks!
- What size is it?
Oh I don't know, it's at least a queen.
Well, that's too big to get home.
- No, we got the truck.
- But awkward, Jocelyn, and awkward with those tiny doorways of yours.
Johnny, help me cover it up.
I don't want other people to see it.
Now, we need a top, and we need a bottom.
Like a skirt, something like that, which I know you're familiar with 'cause you're wearing one.
Okay, these are pants that just so happen to have a pant fabric over the front and back Okay.
Yeah, it's a skirt.
Um, what about this?
It seems durable, yes?
Yeah um, in fashion, durable and elegant rarely go hand in hand.
So I'd put that put that back.
Okay, so not that.
What about this?
Jocelyn seems to like loud floral prints.
Yeah, the thing is, um, this is kind of a special - Kind of blouse.
- Uh-huh.
Have you ever seen "The Devil Wears Prada"?
- Obviously!
- Okay, well, Meryl Streep plays this kind of powerful, sexy fashion woman - Yep, I've seen it!
- Okay, anyway, Jocelyn and I like to have a little fun with that idea, if you know what I mean.
She plays Meryl, and I play the nervous but ambitious intern who's new to the city.
Oh, so you're the So you-you're the Anne Hathaway in that situation?
I don't know who that is.
Well, that's more than enough information for me to go on.
- You're judging me!
- I'm not!
It's just riding a bike is a pretty basic skill.
Mm, is it though?
I think that most kids learn how to ride a bike!
Yeah well, most kids also get head lice.
I'm sorry if the opportunity never presented itself.
Oh what, there was no gap year in Belgium?
No tour de France boyfriend?
Yeah, but I never had to ride the bike!
And David, was such a little drama queen when my parents tried teaching him, that they threw all the bikes into this big bonfire up in the Hamptons, and we never talked about it again.
Oh.
Anyway, I have lots of skills that you don't have.
I am sure that you do.
Like, have you ever had to negotiate in Arabic?
- It is very difficult.
- I believe you.
And try getting into "Kiss Kiss" in Tokyo without a lock of human hair.
Now, you see, if you can do all that, I'm pretty sure that you can learn to ride a bike.
Alexis?
Sorry, I was just thinking about this crazy night at "Kiss Kiss".
Well, this might be the closest we're gonna get to Meryl.
You know, if she got fired from her job at the magazine, and started walking the streets.
Oh, that's a good one!
We haven't tried that one yet.
- Yeah, I wouldn't.
- No, it's a good idea.
Missing Peter Pan?
I'm sorry?
Well, because I see a couple of "Lost Boys".
Hi, I'm Wendy.
Are we shopping for a mother, a girlfriend?
- Actually, my wife.
- Oh!
Yeah, we've got it under control though, so thank you so much.
Oh well, very well, then.
If you need me, I'll be right here.
I know how hard it can be for two men in a women's clothing store.
Well, I'm actually in really good hands, because this man has a woman's touch.
I don't I don't know what that means.
Okay, so we're going with these two pieces.
Oh well, I have to ask, is this for a funeral?
Because we do offer bereavement discounts.
No, why would you think that?
Well, just very somber, serious pieces.
Well, we don't want that!
Well, they're not If you're willing, I have a few new pieces that just came in, I'd love for you to see them.
I just don't know if we need to be adding any more options to the mix.
Well, if she's offering, what's the problem?
Everything in here is like one big, tacky blouse.
Oh, come on, that's silly.
Now, I know you men like to play it safe, but I just thought, why not shake it up?
- Ugh!
- Oh, I like these!
- Um Hmm?
- Mhmm!
- Are they durable?
- Oh well, durability a given here at the "Blouse Barn".
And if you're asking my opinion Are we, though?
It's between these two.
Well, this is a real "Sophie's Choice"!
I hope that you and Jocelyn don't role play that at home.
Hell, we've played every Streep movie.
Oh, okay.
Um Would you describe either of those as "quick release"?
Funnily enough, both have snaps.
Oh, great!
Well, then I guess I um Well Uh, which one do you like?
I don't know, it's such a tough choice.
Oh, you're tellin' me!
It's just that I'm finding both of these options - to be a little um - What?
Well, I don't know, we've just spent so much time and energy finding the few pieces that aren't um - Uh - What?
!
I'm trying to find the word to describe what I Oh!
Flirty?
Sassy?
Skanky!
I think the clothes are a bit skanky.
Hmm.
Well!
Skanky.
We'll um, take the funereal skirt then, and the skanky blouse.
And sold!
To Johnny Rose, for the price of $15 dollars!
Which uh, I hope you can afford.
You know, considering your financial situation.
Yeah, I get it Ray, I get it.
I get it.
I've got cash, and I'd just like my cufflinks, please.
And now, moving on to bedroom items.
First we'll have a brand new queen sized memory foam mattress.
We'll start the bidding on the bed at $50 dollars.
We have $50!
- $60!
- Moira.
- Ssh!
- Ooh, I smell a bidding war!
- Do we have $70?
- $70!
$70!
Do I have $75?
- $75!
- Moira, what are you doing?
We are currently sleeping on a rectangular collection of knives and barbed wire, John.
$75, do we have $80?
- $80!
- $80!
- $90!
- Moira, we can't afford this!
- You got the cufflinks!
- For $15 dollars!
- $90!
Do we have $100?
- $100!
- $100!
- You just bid against yourself!
Do I hear $105?
Do you remember what we used to sleep on?
Texas Kings!
- $130!
- Wow, $130!
Do I hear $135?
- $140!
- $150!
- $160!
- Moira, I'm begging you!
Oh, she has a decent bed, John, - she's just being greedy!
- $165, anyone?
- $170!
- You did it again!
- I know what I'm doing!
- $170!
$180?
- Ray, I think we're done here!
- $180!
$180!
Do I hear $190?
One-nine two hundred!
$200!
Wow, Mrs. Rose.
You're really going for it, which is surprising Yeah, Ray, you know what, that was just a joke bid, so.
Oh, I understand.
Unfortunately that joke bid is currently our highest at $200 dollars!
Going once, going twice, two hundred and one!
- $201 going once, going twice, - Don't!
Sold, to Jocelyn Schitt, for $201 dollars.
Well, thank you for this delightful trip.
You know, I'm starting to get the feeling that uh, you're a little upset.
What would give you that impression?
Well, I first noticed it when heart came on, and nobody was taking the high parts.
- Oh my God!
- Look you should feel good about yourself!
Come on, you made some great choices today.
Nothing we bought today came anywhere close to something Meryl Streep would wear in "The Devil Wears Prada," nothing!
Oh jeez, you are so touchy!
God, you're like a - a fancy dinner plate that you don't wanna nudge off the edge of the table.
Okay, I don't know what that means.
Um listen, I don't have a lot to my name right now, but I do have one thing.
- Self-respect?
- No, taste.
And when that is not appreciated, or worse, publicly undermined, publicly Uh yeah, I might get a little upset.
Look, David-David!
Listen.
If I wasn't so easily swayed by powerful women in a retail environment, I would've been there for you.
Okay, because I honestly believe that really do have a very, very sharp eye.
Thank you, that's nice of you to say.
Trust me, when Joc sees this blouse, I'm gonna make sure she knows you're the one - that picked it out.
- I didn't pick that blouse.
I know, but I'm gonna tell her you did.
Okay, thanks so much.
- This is ridiculous!
- This is how you learn.
Everyone is looking at me, Mutt!
No one is looking at you!
- Ugh!
- Is everything okay?
People were saying that a girl was struggling with her bike.
I kinda just assumed it was a toddler.
No, I am a grown adult young woman.
Okay, this is how my dad taught me, and this is how I'm teaching you!
I'm glad I knew how to ride a bike when we dated.
Yeah, I don't really trust your dad in terms of like, "teachable moments".
You know, one of my mom's boyfriends had a really great trick.
He used to say, "one foot on the ground, one foot on the pedal, now get the hell outta here"!
Hey, that's fun, I like that, let's try that.
Okay fine, I'm just saying, if it's something you never did before - There you go!
- Okay, wait!
Are you coming, or do I just keep like, driving straight?
I didn't teach you how to brake yet!
Get the hell outta here, you dumb broad!
That was another thing he used to say.
Hey.
Roland!
Johnny, um, do you have a minute?
- Yeah.
- Come here.
What's going on?
Well Johnny, I'm about to make you the most popular guy in room 6.
Is this the mattress?
Okay, yeah, I've got a big heart, all right, don't spread it around.
I talked Jocelyn into letting you have it.
You're giving us the mattress?
Well, practically, it's yours for $200 bucks.
That's a dollar less than you paid for it!
Johnny, it's barely out of the plastic.
We can't afford it.
Oh I see, you're the master negotiator at work here, huh?
Okay, um, $195.
We can't afford it!
Okay, hardball, huh?
I'll play.
Um, $182.50.
- All right, bye, Roland.
- Fifty bucks.
Fifty?
Look, I'll level with you, okay?
Um, we tried it out as soon as Jocelyn brought it home.
You tried it out?
Yeah, not enough bounce for the bumps, - if you know what I mean.
- Hmm.
But given your advanced years, it might just be the thing for you and Moira.
Yeah well, we're not that old But $50?
Kudos to you, Mr. Rose.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm so comfortable!
Well, only the best for you, my dear.
Yet they didn't want it?
Oh, I think they just felt sorry for us.
Well, that seems strange, John.
Especially since Jocelyn paid over $200 for it.
You know what I think, I think they tried it out, and uh, it just didn't work for them.
And by tried it out, you mean I mean they tried it out.
Eww!
Oh God!
No!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh God, that's memory foam, John!
Oh Moira, we've stayed at Kennedy compound, Oh!
This can't be any worse than that!
The Kennedys aren't Roland!
The Kennedys have regular medicals, daily laundering!
This has gotta be better than the motel mattress we were using, I mean, who knows who tried that out!
Is that supposed to be helping me?
!
Moira, this is a $50 dollar gift from heaven.
I mean, look, hey!
I don't feel any springs, no nails, no bolts!
It's comfy, come to bed.
Tomorrow we get a mattress cover.
Yes, yes, that's the spirit.
Oh - Oh!
- Mm!
Ahh Seriously, don't think about it.
Okay, so you have to keep it upright.
I don't even wanna do this!
David, you're gonna feel so good, trust me.
Oh my God, you know that I have bad foot-eye coordination, you didn't have to wear corrective leg braces for three months.
You can't blame everything on having been pigeon-toed, David.
- Oh my God!
- Kids, your mother and I are gonna Oh my God, David, what are you doing?
!
I'm teaching him how to ride a bike!
Oh please don't, you know I can't stand the sight of blood.
Seriously son, you're gonna hurt yourself!
David, it is one foot on the pedal, and one foot on the ground, and then get the hell out of here!
Okay?
I don't know what that means.
Okay, I'm gonna hold the back.
Aah!
He's coming, come on, come on!
Oh, okay-aah!
Aah!
Aah!
David, the pedals make it move more!
- John, he's doing it!
- You're doing it, son!
Oh my God.
- Yay!
- Woo Hoo Hoo!
Hey, someone get my camera!
- Nobody get a camera!
- David!
Over here!
Alexis.
I'm sleeping!
Oh, honey.
Honey, I need to ask you a serious question, has it gotten worse or are you just not wearing any makeup?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Do you like this sweater?
Jared Leto gave it to me and I've always been on the fence about it.
I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
You either like it, or you don't like it.
I mean, I like it 'cause Jared Leto gave it to you, and he was my first kiss, but I don't know if I like, like it, like it.
Um, that's not really an answer.
I feel really bad, I feel like there's something burning in my throat.
Oh my God, well, you could've answered the question by now.
So I guess I'm wearing it.
Dad, can you bring me some juice?
- Be right there, honey!
- Yes, we'll be right there!
I knew this day would come, John!
Isolated, impoverished, cut off from all medical services!
I only prayed it wouldn't be Alexis.
- It's just a cold, Moira.
- Oh, it's always just a cold, John, until it's full blown Typhoid!
I don't have typhoid!
Well, of course you don't, what are the chances of that?
!
Do you remember Valentina?
Our chambermaid in little Martinique?
We all thought she had just a cold, until it was too late!
I'll never shake the mental image of her frothing and flailing in the water taxi!
I can still hear you!
We love you, Alexis!
- Don't we?
!
- We love you, Alexis.
Tell her you're gonna bring her the juice.
I am bringing the juice, Moira.
John, don't touch her.
Ohhh This is as far as I go, Alexis.
One of us has to stay safe for David.
I'm already in the room.
See, we're still alive, Moira, I think we're gonna be okay.
Of course you are, that's the spirit.
I'm just going to close this door until you're done.
Sorry!
I'm sorry!
Oh!
Uh Do you like this sweater?
Honestly While I admire your courage, uh, when it comes to fashion, I'm just not the best person to ask.
- Okay.
- What's going on?
Nothing.
- Mm, you seem stressy.
- I'm not.
I'm not stressy.
I just want to make a lasting impression, so It's a job interview?
For a "brand manager" position at an upscale boutique.
In Elmdale?
!
Okay, there are certain lies I tell myself, and if you're any kind of a friend, you' will let me cling to those lies.
And, drive me to the interview.
So is this like, an either/or type thing?
Can I help you cling to lies, and not drive you to Elmdale?
Okay, I'm gonna change my sweater, and meet you at your car, so.
It's like a poncho.
So the guys says to me, "well, I wouldn't try that with a fractured larynx"!
I wouldn't try that, period!
- Morning, boys.
- Hi, Johnny.
- Ahem!
- Oh man!
Oh, boy.
Well, if you gentlemen don't mind, I'd like to start my day.
Yeah, me too, um Do you guys wanna see a card trick?
- Oh, I do.
- Okay, first thing I need is a deck of cards.
All right, you know what, I hate to break up this party, but this is my office, and I do have a lot of work to do, so up, Roland.
Your office?
Uh, well that's kind of interesting, Johnny, because I don't remember seeing your application for a new business license.
Oh jeez!
To be a fly on the wall for this conversation!
Bob, you're in the room.
You know, Johnny, it's kind of standard procedure for new businesses to register.
But then again, I guess you don't really have a lot to register, do you?
Maybe not to you, Roland, but keep in mind I did start Rose Video with $2,000 dollars and a dream, so it's all about planning.
I see it every day.
Lots of quiet planning.
Sure, he treats himself to a muffin or two, but uh, I get that that's all part of the planning, right, Johnny?
Could be.
Yeah, could be.
I mean I could look at this muffin and say, this is a fine muffin.
I'd kill for a bagel, but I haven't seen one bagel since I got to this town.
Now, back at Rose Video, I used to get my assistant to bring me a bagel every morning.
So I might think a bagel shop is something this town could use.
Oh, I love a good bagel, Johnny.
Do you-do you think that idea really has legs?
Well, it's just an example, Bob.
Ooh, I just get chills thinking that we're sitting right in the middle of the "Johnny Rose Dream Factory"!
Ooooh!
Stupid baby.
I'll tell you what, Johnny, instead of the license fee, I'll just take a bite of your muffin.
Mmm!
Good!
Mmmm!
Mm!
Mm!
I have to go to this Jazzagals rehearsal, Alexis, so I'll need your word you'll remain stable.
We're a long way from any hospitals.
You can't be playing fast and loose with those symptoms.
Alexis?
Alexis?
!
- I'm sleeping!
Oh, honey!
Honey, I need to ask you a serious question.
Has it gotten worse, or are you just not wearing any makeup?
Your freaking out is not helping anything!
Well, I'm sorry, dear, but you're the first one to get sick here, and I-I can't I don't I appreciate your concern, but it's only a cold, and I just need to get better.
You're right.
Do I have a fever, though?
- I don't know.
- Can you see?
Hmm.
Ugh!
I think you have to do it without the tissue.
You're right, okay, put your hand up on the forehead.
Mom!
Oh God!
- It's warm!
- How warm?
I don't know Alexis, I'm not a nurse!
Though I played one once in a lovely little production of "Harvey," but she worked in a mental institute.
I blame those late nights at the barn.
Cold air whistling in and out, and you and Mutt not wearing near enough clothing.
Everybody gets sick sometimes.
Speak for yourself!
I'm sorry, Alexis, I'm sorry I must leave you, but mummy's gotta fight for her solo.
Arghhhh!
No.
Nope.
No.
- What?
- Well, this can't be it.
That's it.
Can't you tell by how upscale the boutique is?
Well, that's false advertising!
I've been in this boutique, and nothing about it is upscale!
How did you being in this store ever happen?
I was with Roland, we were shopping for Jocelyn.
It's a long, frightening story.
Anyway, we can't be here, we need to go.
Why?
What's the big deal?
There is a solid chance I may have insulted the owner.
Oh well, that doesn't sound like something you'd do.
She has very questionable taste.
And I may or may not have told her that to her face.
So there is no point in being here, you can start the car.
I didn't drive all the way out here for you not to do this.
Also, this is probably the only job in this town that you'll ever be qualified for.
Okay, so do you want me to lead with that, or hold it 'til the end, and keep it as a surprise?
You know, Johnny I think you're really on to something with this bagel idea.
Yeah, but Bob, as I said this morning, it wasn't so much an idea, as it was an example of an idea.
I see.
Well, for example, if you were to open a bagel shop, what would be the first thing you'd need to do?
Well offhand, I honestly don't know, I suppose I'd start by finding a space.
And then I'd probably source out a bagel oven, and um, a bagel Baker.
Sesame seeds?
Gwen loves the ones with sesame seeds.
Yeah well, whatever.
And then we get the blueberry cream cheese.
- Ooh!
- Yeah.
Listen Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but even if this bagel shop was a viable idea - Which I think it is.
- Fair enough.
But you still have Considerable overhead.
I mean, you wanna make sure you're making Good bagels the real way.
Well, You would certainly know how to make them the real way, because you're uh you - Jewish?
- I didn't know if I could say it.
But boy, do you all love your bagels!
I mean I do too, and I'm not even uh Jewish.
You can say it, Bob.
I don't know why, it feels like a swear.
What's the one you can't say?
Okay, you know what, I've got a lot of work to do, Bob, but thanks for stopping by.
So David!
This is quite the resume.
If I ever need a performance artist I know who to call.
- Thank you.
- Skanky!
- Excuse me?
- You called my store skanky when you were here with the mayor.
Mmm mmhm.
Hmm.
Well, what I think I'd bring to the position is a worldly approach to merchandising, and sales tactics.
We're not over the skanky thing, are we?
No, and I can't help but wonder, why you'd wanna work in a store you described as skanky!
I don't know if we need to keep saying the word.
Skanky!
Do you still think my store is skanky, David?
Which is why I feel like I can help.
You think I need your help?
!
Well, I am answering an ad in the paper.
Well David, I am looking for a partner.
Someone who believes in my store.
Well, I can say with complete certainty that I see literally nothing but potential.
In your store, you know?
Is the floor overcrowded?
Yeah.
Are the mannequins a little too busty?
Absolutely.
Does it smell like urinal cakes in here?
Perhaps.
Well, this is all very constructive, and it's clear you have some strong ideas.
It seems as though you have trouble filtering negative thoughts.
So I don't know if I can trust you to represent the "Blouse Barn".
Okay, well, this has been a treat.
Thank you so much.
I'll need to see you on the floor, working with customers.
Okay.
- Can I help you?
- Bob want us to meet.
Bob wants us to meet?
!
- Yeah, may I sit?
- No, no.
Hey there, Johnny.
- Bob?
- This is Ivan.
- Uh huh?
- Take a load off.
- Ah.
- Well sure, sit.
Sit down.
Ivan would like to help with the uh, bagel idea.
Well, there's no bagel - I mean, you know, Bob, I already told you I got some brick.
You've got bricks?
What bricks?
- For bagel oven.
- Yeah.
Ivan works down at the quarry, he's got a whole truck filled with bricks.
Right out front!
Bob, you know, this bagel shop idea was just an idea.
You know, it's not even an idea, it's just an illustration of a theoretical idea.
Well, that may be, but do you know how much a bagel oven costs?
And Ivan here, he's willing to do it for free.
- As long as I get to - As long as he gets to make the bagels.
- Yeah.
- Wow, well, no one is making any bagels.
- Right now.
- You want me to start unloading?
No, no unloading.
Ivan, would you excuse us for a minute?
I just wanna have a word with Bob.
- Oh yeah, sure.
- Okay.
Could you stand, and excuse us?
All right, oh, okay.
I'll meet you out there in a minute.
Bob, you know, we are so f Oh.
We are so far from even remotely having a conversation about this You know, business.
Yeah.
Okay.
You said you started Rose Video with $2,000 bucks and a dream.
I-Bob, you-you don't have to Let's turn this dream Into green!
Bob, I don't want your check.
Oh my God.
- Ooh!
- Do you think I should get it?
Mm!
That's a question.
- You don't like it.
- I never said that.
I never said that, I feel You know, in France, they say the looser the fit, the sexier the feel, so I've never been to France.
Okay, what if I pulled a few other options, and um, see what happens?
I'll be right back.
Hi!
How much longer do you expect me to wait in the car like some hired chauffeur?
!
Um, yeah, I'm gonna need you to do something for me.
Like drive home without you?
Uh no, Wendy has got me on a bit of a trial run with the customers, and I'm gonna need you to help me out by looking like you're enjoying this conversation a little more than you are, um, I'm gonna need you to buy a couple blouses from me.
- A couple?
!
- One.
A blouse.
- What about this?
- Well, that's not an option.
- That-no.
- But I have my sister's communion this weekend.
- Okay, don't do that.
- Don't do what?
Do you not like it?
Don't, Stevie!
Good recommendation, sir!
This is gonna be a smash at my husband's trial hearing.
He's got good taste.
Okay, so I've pulled a few options.
Or we can go with what we have.
- These are stupid.
- Okay.
Alexis?
The woman at the general store said a girl in Elmdale recently contracted avian flu.
So I got you a bit of everything.
Oh I see you're already being taken care of.
Hello.
I didn't realize you were feeling well enough for company.
I just brought over a few things to help break the fever.
And it's really helping, thank you.
No, I-I'm relieved that Alexis has someone with such natural care-giving tendencies.
- I'm gonna go.
- No babe, stay.
Had I known your spirits were so high, I might not have spent the last 45 minutes of my life running around buying cold medication.
I didn't ask you to go buy cold medication.
When have you ever bought me cold medication?
!
Exactly, I knew it didn't feel right.
I think you're in good hands now, babe.
- No!
- Uh-huh.
Oh dear, are we sure this isn't just mono again?
What with your symptoms, and your lifestyle?
Mrs. Rose, I don't have mono.
Oh no offense dear, could be others.
- Oh my God!
- Get some rest.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Weren't you supposed to be at choir practice?
Rehearsal.
Yes.
I supposed to be there over an hour ago.
So why aren't you?
Because I kept picturing you diseased and all alone.
That's never stopped you before.
I know!
What the hell is going on, Alexis!
I'm feeling something.
Something debilitating!
You're the ill one, but I'm I'm feeling this - This - Maternal instinct, maybe?
No, that's not it.
No!
Maybe.
No!
Have I offended you in some way, Johnny?
Probably.
I'm just wondering at what point you decided to cut me out.
- Of what?
- Well, I assumed I would be consulted before we made any major decisions - about the bagel business.
- What decisions?
!
Well, hiring Ivan for one thing, I don't have good feeling about that guy.
I think he's ex-KGB.
Roland, there is no bagel business!
Okay, it was just a stupid idea I made up because you were right.
Well, I know that!
Right about what?
About me not doing anything.
It's tough enough coming up with a business idea, let alone a money making idea in a town this small, and I was you know, putting a lot of pressure on myself.
Maybe too much pressure.
And I've been doing nothing but treading water.
So I started rambling about bagels this morning.
Look at this, the brain trust!
So I was thinking, and uh, I'm not married to it, but uh "Bob's Bagels".
Johnny, I think you have something you'd like to say to Bob.
You don't wanna use the name Bob?
Oh, I get it, go with something a little more old testament?
Bob that's not it, no.
See, there won't be a bagel shop.
'Cause I've looked into it, and it's not feasible.
And there already is a bagel shop in Elmdale.
But Ivan's about to hand in his notice down at the quarry, and uh I gave you that check!
Yes and of course I'm-I'm returning This check to you.
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.
You took money from Bob?
- Why didn't you come to me?
- You would've given me money?
No, of course not, but as your partner You're not a partner!
Not my partner.
Look Bob, I appreciate all the confidence you've shown in me.
I really do, and I promise you this: I will come up with a better idea real soon.
You know, next time uh I should probably see a business plan so I don't invest so much in another uh, hollow scheme.
Yeah, me too.
- You didn't invest.
- Yes, and whose fault is that?
Mm Well, congratulations.
Let me get the champagne.
You guys are gonna love it, it's the same one we use to celebrate my mom's divorces.
- Great - So how long before I can return this?
Oh, it's exchange or store credit only.
- That's funny.
- I'm not joking.
Well, I guess you're buying drinks tonight.
I can do that, that's fair.
And dinner.
- Okay.
- And if I feel like dessert It's a $12 dollar negligee on a 2-for-1 promotion so Okay, I'll just drop a little raisin in here to release the bubbles.
Blechhh!
That's no necessary!
Okay!
Congratulations!
A whole raisin.
To your first job.
Ooh, my first job was actually a gap kids campaign when I was six.
- To your first job!
- Mm!
So tired - Yeah.
- Tell me a story.
- How about a song?
- No!
A story it is.
Um There once was a radiant young actress, who dreamed of having two sons.
The second of which would be named Alex.
- I don't like this story.
- Shh!
Now it seems the vivacious daytime Emmy nominee was surprised by how taken she was with this unanticipated daughter.
Mostly because she didn't cry as much as the unmannerly son, but also because she was adventurous, carefree, so beautiful.
Just like her mother.
Alexis, you're on my arm.
Alexis, seriously.
I can't feel it!
I can't-Alexis!
- Aah!
Go to sleep, dear.
Ray, I have always seen you as a sensitive, cultured man of the world.
Thank you.
And I'm sure your family wanted more for you when they immigrated from - Winnipeg.
- Winnipeg?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Look at the state of this place, it's like we're in a Mumbai-an slum.
A year ago we had a staff of twenty-five working the grounds of our home, and now we walk by a mattress on the side of the road, without thinking twice about it.
Well, the good news is that mattress is covering up - the cracked toilet seat.
- Oh, John.
John, do you remember what Goldie Hawn told us at that Amfar dinner?
I dunno.
"You are the life you accept for yourself".
Those are Goldie's words.
Or something someone said to her in India.
Or perhaps she read it.
In any case, it has always stayed with me.
John, I will not accept this life.
And neither should you!
Yeah.
I mean, would it kill someone to plant a few peonies?
!
I have a feeling if you want peonies, Moira, you're gonna have to plant them yourself.
These are dark times John, but not that dark.
I love how we can just be silent with each other.
Yeah.
I mean, I definitely feel like we used to talk more at the beginning, but um, it's good that we don't have to do that anymore.
Because now we can just express how we feel through silence.
- What?
- Nothing.
What?
It's just, you're talking about how nice it is not to talk, but you're still, talking about it.
I mean, yeah, I'm not a mute!
Well, that is an understatement.
Are we having some non-fight fight or something?
Because all I'm saying is that it's nice to not talk, but apparently I'm not allowed to say that?
!
No fight.
It's not a fight.
All I am saying is that you know, you need to talk about everything, and I don't.
I don't need to talk about everything, I'm just saying that, if I stopped talking, then who knows when we're gonna start talking again.
You know?
- That way.
- Thank you.
Are those my mannequins?
Yeah.
Well, where are they going?
!
- Oh, I sold them on eBay.
- Well, what do you mean?
But don't worry, I'm using the money to buy other mannequins, ones that are a little less um - Fun?
- Porn-y.
Uh, I also placed a few other orders.
Little things to scatter around the store, to give the space a more directional feel.
Oh David, I saw some cute little knick-knacks that I thought we could pair with the scarves.
- Where are the scarves?
- Oh, I sold those, too.
Oh.
Well, things are happening very quickly.
Now the candles, are they something that we would sell at a blouse store?
No, those are just decorative.
Scent is a really important factor in defining a brand.
Alexander Wang once fired my friend over the smell of his cologne.
To Alex's credit, "Curve Pour Hommes" hasn't been the look since '97.
Well, the look and the smell here's very "woody", very funky.
Now David, you don't have to sell all my things off.
You can use the company credit card.
Yeah, I used that, too.
Oh well then, save all the receipts, because anything you buy for the store is a write off.
The candles, and the jewelry stands No jewelry stands.
- No jewelry - Noooo!
No, David!
Jewelry stands!
I have taken a moment out of my busy schedule, because this poor town is sliding into disarray.
There is a filthy mattress just lying on the side of the road a few blocks from here!
Oh no, that's Dick Sinson's mattress, he's giving it away.
Ray, I have always seen you as a sensitive, cultured, man of the world.
- You have that striking accent.
- Thank you.
And I'm sure your family wanted more for you when they immigrated from - Winnipeg.
- Winnipeg.
We deserve more, don't we, ray?
We deserve cleanliness, we deserve flower beds, we deserve better lives!
- You make some very good points Mrs. Rose.
- Thank you.
But can I ask why are you talking to me about this?
I'm hoping to take my complaint to council, and I've been told you'd be the easiest one to crack.
Too kind.
And I'd be happy to help.
Excellent!
But unfortunately, I'm no longer on the town council.
I resigned a few weeks ago, too overwhelmed with my businesses.
But uh, you're more than welcome to take it to council yourself, with my endorsement.
Which won't really help, since I resigned.
Um, and council wasn't too happy about it.
I'm surprised you didn't hear, I talked about it extensively on my podcast.
I don't know how I missed that.
David, is that you?
- Huh?
- Hey!
Look at us, son, a couple of working stiffs back from the salt mines.
- What?
!
- Two men, back from the mines.
What mines?
What's that mean?
It's a figure of speech.
Um, I don't get that.
The salt mines!
Back from when people mined.
- Uh huh - When miners worked in the, salt industry, they'd come home, after digging salt.
I don't know what it means!
Uh-huh, you know I just got back from a four-hour shift that mostly consisted of me sampling luxury candles so Well, that's - that's a tough day.
Hmm.
Why don't you grab yourself a cold one?
You've earned it.
Working man.
- Thank you.
- There's nothing in here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Oh, I must've taken the last one.
Okay.
You know, for what it's worth, son, I just wanted to tell you uh - How proud of you I am.
- Thank you.
I mean, you got this job all on your own, nobody had to make a call, nobody got involved, nobody had to pay somebody off.
- What?
- And you're looking very, very sharp.
- Well - Is that a new sweater?
Uh, it is.
Well, word to the wise, son, don't spend all your money at once.
- I thought you weren't getting involved.
- No, I'm not.
I'm not, I'm just saying, word to the wise, is all.
Okay, what does "word to the wise" even mean?
Word to the wise.
When you're speaking to somebody wise, you lis you're cognizant of what they're saying.
A wise person telling you Anyway, just-just uh, keep that in mind, and um Keep up the good work.
Thanks so much.
I'm just gonna use this now.
So Wake up sleepy head, nap time's over.
Honestly, honestly, I have no money, and an empty purse from two seasons ago!
Alexis, it's me.
Oh my God!
Your face!
Yes, you can see it now!
You shaved!
Are you-are you crying?
No!
No, um, when did you do this?
Just now, I felt like a change.
And you didn't talk to me about it.
About me shaving my beard?
- Yeah.
- Okay, what would we have talked about?
It's my face.
Um You'd have said, uh, "wow Alexis, I'm thinking about shaving my beard".
And then I would've said, "hm, no mutt, I don't think that that's the right journey for you at this point in time".
Well, then I would've said, "too bad".
I shave like, every six months.
Okay, you try growing a beard!
I was a beard for a very well known actor, and I get it, it's uncomfortable.
But your beard is like, my favorite thing about you!
My beard is your favorite thing about me!
- I said one of my favorite things.
- No, no, no, no.
You said, "favorite thing"!
I just woke up, and you have a different face.
So there's just a lot going on right now!
Yeah, tell me about it, I just found out that my girlfriend's favorite thing about me is the hair that grows out of my face!
I'm just saying That I think that that was a decision that we needed to make as a couple.
Okay?
We need to communicate more.
I really didn't think that "this" was a thing we needed to talk about.
I thought we had a deeper thing goin' on.
That's not what this is about.
This is about me being left out of the loop.
I do need to talk.
And maybe if we had talked more, I could have prepared myself for this.
Look at your little doll lips.
Thank you for installing the ramp at the post office But it's a little steep.
I've tried it twice, and both times, I've been sort of shot back into traffic.
Yeah, but see the thing with a ramp is, it's kind of a momentum thing, you really gotta you know, give it a Attention please, council!
I have a concern.
I was just hoping to be interrupted by a concerned citizen.
Would you like to be added to the agenda, Moira?
No need, I'm prepared to speak now.
Well, that just doesn't work, I mean, we have a list, uh Bob, just concentrate on the minutes, okay?
I can tell right now you're behind.
Okay, typing is not my strong suit.
Ray could type without looking at the keys.
This will take but a moment.
I can't imagine you have anything more pressing this afternoon.
Well, actually, Jennifer had the floor.
Hello.
You could've spoken up.
Excuse me.
David, if you're going out again, can you pick up some new toilet paper?
I cannot use the stuff the motel provides, okay?
It's like a birthday streamer.
You-you-it stretches, and then, and then you pull it, and it just snaps, okay?
That-that whole thing just fell off the roller!
Wow, um, dad, you remember Stevie.
Yes, yes, I remember Stevie.
I know Stevie.
I knew Stevie was here.
That's why I came in with something funny.
Hmm.
Oh yeah, sure.
What's this?
Looks expensive.
Oh, this is some new bedding.
David, didn't I just Tell you to save your money?
Uh, yeah.
I am testing this out for the store, so work is paying for it.
Work is paying for your bedding?
I was gonna leave, but now I don't want to.
What is that?
Is that a new lamp?
Yeah, I'm thinking of bringing home-ware into the store, so that's a write off.
- That's a write off?
- Yeah.
Do you even know what a write off is?
!
Uh yeah, it's when you buy something for your business and the government pays you back for it.
Oh, and who pays for it?
Nobody, you write it off.
Who writes it off?
!
I don't know, the govern The "write off" people!
Why are we having this conversation?
So if I need booze to get through my day, - I can just write that off?
- That's a stretch.
But the skin care products you got this morning, those are a write off.
What skin care products?
You purchased skin care products?
!
Okay, okay.
I am the face of the company.
If I have acne, what does that say about the legitimacy of the store?
That's not a write off!
That's not a write off!
This?
!
Not a write off!
Oh, well, the bedding's non refundable, so.
David, a write off is a business expense used to reduce your taxable income!
Okay, well then why isn't it called a "tax write off"?
It is!
It is, you can't just buy things for yourself, and write them off!
Well then, I'll return some things.
There's not enough space in here for the massage chair, anyway.
I should get back to work.
Just in case any more of your packages arrive.
I am here to address an issue that I believe Self-respect.
I don't think we can help you in that department.
I'm speaking about what we have allowed to happen to this town.
Everyone leaving their old things here and there, like some city-wide garage sale!
I deserve better!
We deserve better.
A baby born in a prison cell does not know that a toilet should not be in the same room as its bed, but we do.
I didn't know you'd been in prison.
What?
No, I'm illustrating a point.
Okay, picture all of you living in a cave, having never seen the outside world And then I show up.
No, this is not what I'm trying to say.
What are you trying to say?
That we should strive for something that sets us apart from the prison baby.
Greenery!
We need greenery!
Flowers, Boxwood trees!
Two sets each for the cafe, and the motel.
And then a citywide clean up, and I will not take no for an answer.
Yeah well, I was actually just gonna suggest that.
Before you suggested it.
Thank you.
So there was just one baby in prison, or there were more?
- Did you lose weight?
- I shaved my beard.
Oh, I like it.
You look younger.
Thank you, Twyla.
That means a lot.
So, what can I get you guys?
Um, what's the cake today?
I'm sorry, did you just ask for cake?
I'm not used to you ordering solid food.
Yeah, I'll just have a slice of whatever.
I guess I'm having cake.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
I don't know, I just feel like something's changed with us.
Huh.
What are you thinking?
I don't know if anything's changed.
I think maybe we know each other better now.
Maybe that's the problem.
No, no, I'm not saying that there's a problem, I'm just saying that there are definitely a few things between us that need to be adjusted in order to make this work for us.
Like maybe I need to talk less and listen more, and you need to talk more, and listen less.
And are you willing to make these adjustments?
Well Are you?
- Uh - I brought two forks.
Just in case you wanted to share.
S Hmm.
Yeah.
Be careful on those stairs!
Hey, next order of business, we install a ramp here.
- Hey!
- Hmm?
You really put Roland on the spot there.
I was simply exercising a basic human right.
Yeah, and I don't disagree with you.
I've always known you were on my side.
I wouldn't go that far.
But I will say this, usually these council decisions, they take weeks.
Oh, I won't wait for anyone's decision.
I once got Winnie Mandela to RSVP to an "Artists Against Eczema" benefit within the hour.
You're a pain in the ass, but you get stuff done.
- A delightful compliment.
- Hmm, but those boxwood trees?
Oh yes, two sets, and if you know a good ceramicist I would lower your expectations.
You're lucky if you get some daisies in a planter.
But good work.
- Thank you.
Eczema benefit?
Yes, you try enjoying a puff pastry with everyone around you scratching.
Ew!
Ugh!
What's going on?
I think Mutt and I ended things.
You think?
Okay, here's a serious question: Are you capable of making an executive decision?
It's done.
Um what happened?
I don't know, like, we were talking, and then we just Like, didn't talk for a long time.
Okay.
And that's it?
No, and then we talked about why we weren't talking.
And then we both agreed that even though the sex was amazing - Mhmm.
- Like, amazing!
There was this time in the barn where I climbed up onto this rafter But yeah, no, I think-I think we're good.
Yeah, anyway, we both agreed that we'd just been lusting after each other for such a long time that that's what we were holding onto, and not what was right in front of us.
- Which was what?
- What?
What was right in front of you?
- When?
- Okay.
Okay.
So anyway, it's done.
And it's just really weird, because I've never felt anything after a break up.
- Mhmm.
- Like, nothing.
Like, I've been to doctors about it.
- Mhmm - But this time, it's different.
Well, that's good.
I think he changed me a bit.
Like he knows me.
I let him know me.
You know?
I think I need a hug, or something.
W-you what?
I need a hug.
Uh uh - David, will you please give me a hug?
- Oh, okay, yes, yeah.
Did you get new bedding?
Um, yeah, I did.
But it's a write off, so I don't Anyway.
David, Alexis!
Could you come out here, please?
David, Alexis!
Come see this!
- What?
Honestly, John, it's not worth it.
Your mother has done something we can all be proud of.
Oh, did you pick up that random condom that was on the grass there?
- Ew yeah, whose was that?
- I have no idea.
No, that's not it.
Not it.
They'll never see it.
Throw it on the long list of things I've done for my children they don't appreciate.
Your mother had these boxwoods put in.
- Weren't those here before?
- There was literally nothing here.
It was a wasteland.
Weren't there more plants here before?
No, there weren't!
And there are more around town.
Thanks to your mother.
That's great.
Okay.
- Are we good with the plants, or?
- Can we go?
Yeah.
- Yeah, we're good.
- Okay.
Oh, there's the condom right there, David.
Ew!
Eww!
There seems to be a rumor going around about me.
I heard that one.
It's only because you converse with women easily and you dress so well.
I wouldn't give it another thought.
- What?
- I'm sorry, which rumor are you talking about?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
- Good Morning!
- Hi, Twyla.
I hear congratulations are in order, Mrs. Rose.
Thank you, dear, for what?
Oh, should I not say anything yet?
Well, you could say something, think of it as a clue.
Not say something about what?
Your wife's big announcement.
Again dear, clue!
- You running for town council!
- What, excuse me?
You're running for town council?
No, I'm not running for town council.
Oh, I must've misheard.
Everyone was talking about you standing up to council last week, so I just assumed Never assume, dear, It makes an ass out of both of us.
It's not that absurd an idea, Moira.
You know, being on town council might give you an outlet to channel all that "passion" you have for this town.
I'd sooner poke my eyes out with hat pins.
Well, that's subtle.
Well, I think you would make a great councilor.
Well, the right person might be able to get a lot done around here.
The right person, John, wouldn't be caught dead in this, they'd be running somewhere a little more - What?
- Moira Okay, maybe I should say somewhere less Less what?
What's the word I'm trying to think of?
Well, let's hope we don't find it, okay?
Are we ready to order, councilor?
You go ahead.
Have you seen my black shoe?
It's a lace up, probably lost in the sea of your dirty clothes?
- No.
- Ugh!
What is going on here?
!
Why are your clothes crammed under my bed?
It's just temporary storage, David.
Look at your things.
Look at your life!
I have been distracted!
Why is this wet?
Ewww!
Because I kicked over a glass of water that you left on the floor.
I wasn't drinking water.
Okay, so maybe it was mine, what difference does it make?
- Ugh!
- Oh my God!
Ugh!
Anyway, I need the room tonight, because I'm having a friend over.
What friend?
Um Twyla, we're gonna have a fun little sleepover.
Mhmm You and Twyla?
Yeah, we're gonna do face masks, and we're gonna talk about boys that we both know, and have dated.
Um, have you spent more than five minutes with the girl, one on one?
She could be a serial killer.
Twy and I have tea together like, every day, David.
That she serves you at the cafe.
Because we're friends.
Oh right.
Um, so then where is Twyla going to sleep tonight?
Because I'd say she could stay under my bed, but your disgusting clothes are all stuffed under there, So just wondering, where she'd sleep!
- Stop doing that with your face!
- Hmm.
Bob, now that Ray's stepped down from council, I gather his seat is up for grabs?
"His seat is up for grabs"?
I could say something pretty inappropriate right now.
Well, I'm hoping you don't.
No, but I could, that's a real set up.
Yeah, yeah, but I was thinking, if his seat There you go again!
Could be filled by someone with real experience - Uh-huh.
- You see, I played a significant role in Gerald Caine's campaign.
Who's that?
Well, he won a seat in the legislature, and now he's a senator.
Yeah well, town council might be small potatoes for a guy like that.
Well, not him, Bob.
Me!
I'm talking about me.
See, I've worked on a number of campaigns, and I was president of the Video Retailers Association.
Sure, and uh it might be a nice change of pace from banging your head against the wall here every day.
Well, I'm not banging my head against the wall, but if I were to run, I'd need support from people like you.
Boy uh, so if you got this, that would mean we'd work together here at the garage, and on council?
If I didn't know any better, I might think you had a crush on me!
Well, that's That's funny.
- I'm only teasing.
- Yeah, I know, I know.
I don't mean to embarrass you.
- I'm not embarrassed!
- You have no reason to be embarrassed.
- You're a happily married man.
- Oh my.
- And so am I!
- Okay, gotta go, Bob.
Hey Twy, come sit!
Oh, I'd love to, it's just I have a lot of tables right now.
Okay, well um, maybe we can hang out after?
I was thinking we could have a little ladies' night at my place.
- Just the two of us?
- Yeah!
Come by around eight.
I'm working tonight, but maybe this weekend?
Or are you with Mutt on weekends?
Um no, because we broke up.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Although, part of me is a little relieved.
Since you did tell me to break up with him, and then you dated him That's so sweet of you, but I'm gonna be fine.
So how late do you have to work tonight?
Um, until people leave, I guess.
And when do people leave?
I don't know, after people clear out.
Okay, well when everybody clears out, you can just pop by.
You know, when I broke up with Mutt, I just took a lot of alone time to rebuild, and regroup, and I just, I think it's so important.
Yeah, and I'm doing the same kind of thing right now.
'Cause it's so important.
All right, good.
Because you know what they say, if you can't be by yourself, then you probably shouldn't be in a relationship.
Mmhmm, I totally get that.
But call me if you happen to get off work early.
Twy?
Call me if you get off work early!
All right.
I know.
I know!
- Hey, Roland.
- Uh-huh.
All right, so one o'clock, then?
All right, terrific.
Yeah, no, I look forward to catching up.
Great, yep, you too.
Okay, all right.
Buh-bye!
Sorry, Johnny.
I just had to reschedule my colonoscopy.
Oh.
Well, I just stopped by to pick up a nomination form for town council.
You know, I gotta hand it to you.
Um It takes a brave man to face defeat yet again, when his ego is so battered and bruised.
Well, I don't plan on losing, but thank you for the vote of confidence.
Johnny, nobody plans on losing.
But with all due respect, this is a kind of a different playing field for you.
Roland, I ran the second largest retail video chain in North America, so Well, that's good to hear, so you're used to coming in second, huh?
Could I get a nomination form, please?
!
Look I'm just trying to help you out here, okay?
I've been in politics for 18 years, and let me tell you something, pal, it ain't a cakewalk, okay?
!
Say goodbye to your privacy.
You walk into a restaurant, everybody's gonna know who you are!
Well, everyone knows everyone here, because there's only one restaurant.
I mean, just taking your boy for ice cream cone can turn into a media circus.
Well, your son is 30, and you never see him.
Could I get a form, Roland?
Please?
You know what?
I'll do you one better, I'll give you the form, und your first signature.
- Oh, wow.
- There you go, how 'bout that?
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
You signed under "Date".
Yeah, like that's going to make a difference.
Okay.
Rrrrrr!
Come're, you!
I'm thirsty!
Exciting afternoon?
- Thrilling, can't you tell?
- What are you doing tonight?
- Uh, I'm busy.
- With what?
- I'm going out.
- With who?
- Does it matter?
- Where are you going?
None of your business!
Are you seeing someone?
Not exactly.
Okay, you're sounding very sketchy right now.
I'm going to a bar to meet someone.
- Who?
!
- I don't know yet.
Ohh So she's going to a bar to get laid, then.
- I see - Uh no, she is going to a bar to have her needs met by some lovely gentleman she's yet to meet, who is cute enough to sleep with, but not nearly mature or stable enough to marry.
I want that.
Well, you can't come.
'Cause everyone will think we're together.
Okay, I think you're giving yourself a lot of credit.
I was being generous.
No, We're gonna be each other's wing people tonight.
Um now, how diverse is the clientele at this local drinkery?
I would say very diverse.
I can't remember what life was like before dating apps.
I'm both excited and terrified for tonight.
I don't think I ever said you could come.
Okay, so what time, though?
And is there a dress code?
'Cause I just want to come prepared.
So that I can meet somebody.
I'm in Room 7 in case you need me.
See you later.
This is gonna be so fun for us.
You know, it's uh It's a funny thing, there seems to be a rumor going around about me.
I heard that one, it's only because you converse with women easily, and you dress so well.
I wouldn't give it another thought.
What?
I'm sorry, which rumor are you talking about?
The one about me running for council.
No, that was about me, John.
You were with me when Twyla said that.
If this continues, I'll have to call a neurologist.
No, this is another rumor, Moira.
A rumor about me running for council.
From whom did you hear this one?
Well, I-I don't know where it started, but the gist of it is I'd be a shoo-in, and could really get things done.
Well, there's no question about it.
You'd be a godsend to council.
Well, thank you sweetheart, I agree.
But they'll never know about it, because you have much bigger plans.
Yes, I know, well I see you go into the office every day, pistons firing, you are full of ideas, and you haven't told me what they are yet, but I have every confidence that they are brilliant.
Yeah, yeah Well, who says I can't do both?
Moira, being on council could leverage our position - considerably in this town.
- It's not worth it.
You saw me struggle to get those modest planters for the motel.
Trying to council to focus on the simplest thing is like wrangling monkeys!
Well, I can wrangle monkeys.
It's called running a business.
Yes, you could, but you'd be wasting your talents on these people.
Yeah well, that goes without saying.
Listen, I know it's a giant step down from anything I've done in the past, but Exactly, it's beneath you.
Well, I just worry that the people who were spreading this rumor might be a little disappointed, that's all.
Well, you can't worry about them.
- Hey!
- Hey.
Are you waiting for someone?
No, I'm just taking some "me time".
Oh, okay I hope I'm not getting in the way of that.
No, no, you're good.
So, Stevie you're a strong woman who's alone a lot.
Like, I know you dated David, but everyone's allowed a mistake, am I right?
You sound like my conscience.
Is it hard for you?
Uh, is what hard for me?
Like, being by yourself here?
Like, you're just totally okay to sit here all day by yourself?
That's why I took the job.
Mmhm.
Okay.
And while you're here, by yourself, you never get this almost uncontrollable urge to talk to people, or be complimented, or I know everyone in this town, so for the most part, I would rather be here by myself than engage in meaningless conversation with people I don't care about.
Totally.
Mmhm And why is that?
Because I enjoy my own company more.
Of course.
Of course.
Okay.
Can I have everyone's attention, please?
If I could just-okay.
Thanks, Jazzagals.
I just wanted to grab your ear for just a second, to make a quick announcement.
I will not be at rehearsals for the next two weeks, because I have decided to throw my hat in the ring, and run for council!
Oh, Jocelyn!
That's great!
Oh my gosh!
That's amazing!
I'm currently running unopposed.
So that kinda takes away the excitement of winning, you know, but still, I think it's gonna be a real hoot.
That's so fun!
Congratulations!
Good going!
Good for you!
Thank you.
That's awesome!
That's great!
So Jocelyn, good for you.
Taking on a new little project.
Thanks I'm really looking forward to it.
You know what's funny, just this morning, Twyla asked me if I was running for council.
That is funny.
I mean, unless you're thinking of running.
Mm, no.
No, no.
- Can you imagine?
- No!
I mean, just because you've spent all your time trying to sell the town and get outta here, so.
Twyla dear, what was it this morning that made you say I would make such a great councilwoman?
Oh, I just heard you were running.
- Are you?
- No!
I She's not interested in politics!
Although I can see why someone might think that.
I certainly know how to command a crowd, and I've never been one to shy away from a good fight.
I don't think it's such a bad idea for someone else to run.
A little healthy competition never hurt anyone.
Yeah, a real election race could be fun!
Absolutely, I mean, I wouldn't want anyone to think that I was just stepping into this, you know, because of Roland.
Yeah, I mean, if any of you townies wanna put your name on the ballot, I think that's just a great idea.
That's the spirit.
If Jocelyn can do it, anyone can.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Places!
Don't you think?
Hmm On a scale of one to I'm-gonna-get-beat-up by-an-angry-local, where do we see this look fall?
Um, like, easy six.
- Okay.
- Where are you going?
I am going to a sketchy bar on the outskirts of town.
And nobody invited me?
!
You know how at home I am at sketchy bars!
Who are you going with?
With Stevie, we're gonna meet some randoms.
So um, when I go missing, just feel free to tell people that the last place I was seen was at a sketchy bar on the outskirts of town meeting randoms.
Okay well, this isn't fair, David.
I'm the one who should be at a sketchy bar meeting randoms.
I'm the one who should go missing!
- Well then, come!
- I can't.
- Why?
- Well, for one thing, this mask doesn't come off for another twenty minutes.
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.
And second, I told myself that I would enjoy my own company tonight.
Okay um, well, we're going to a bar, and you're on the rebound, so text me when you're dressed.
I'm serious, David, I'm not coming.
Have fun, though.
Oh, and in case you wake up in a chair with your hands duct taped together, you can snap the duct tape by just raising your hands over your head, and then bringing them down really hard.
Thanks.
Um see you there?
I'm not coming.
I'm not coming.
Hi, Moira.
How was rehearsal?
It was quite an afternoon.
Oh John, thank you.
Listen, I just wanted to thank you - for what you said this morning.
- And what's that?
When we had our little talk about me running for council.
I have to admit I'd given it a little more thought than I'd let on.
- Oh?
- Yes.
I actually picked up a nomination form.
Really John, I didn't realize.
No, no, no, I'm glad you talked me out of it.
- Okay.
- Yeah, because I thought about the job, what it would entail, and you know, listen, Roland drives me crazy when he's not even around, - but can you imagine?
- No!
Working with him every day?
Huh!
I'm laughing about it right now.
Did you know Jocelyn is running?
No, oh my God!
This gets better and better.
So the two of them on council together?
Is there a more frightening thought?
They would have a virtual monopoly on this town.
Well, don't they already?
Exactly, I think someone needs to challenge them!
Right!
So what are you saying?
- That I should run?
- No.
Nope.
Because I did get five signatures on my nomination form, and I No!
No, no, no, John, you've got enough on your plate.
- Oh.
- Whereas I have nothing but free time.
I'm not exactly sure where this is going.
John, you have the family to think about.
You're going to accomplish wonderfully big things.
Town council would just, hold you back.
But something tells me it will not be holding you back?
It would be a few weeks of my time.
And you know, someone said it might be a nice project for me.
And would that someone be you?
Jocelyn practically begged me to take the bait!
So you're running for council?
!
- Looks like it.
- Oh well, isn't that wonderful!
Isn't that wonderful!
Hey, that's really good news.
I'm sorry, John, I just got swept up in it.
No, no, listen as long as one of us is running, okay?
That's the important thing.
It doesn't matter which one of us is running.
I thought it would be me, but then you talked me out of it!
But that's okay!
Please John, I'm going to need you every step of the way.
And I'll be right behind you Moira, supporting you, because you're the one running, and I'm not!
How long are we going to be doing this?
Oh, just a few more minutes, at least.
It's not usually this dead.
It's like everybody saw you coming, and left.
Is this really what our lives have become?
Sitting in some sad bar waiting to get laid?
Well it's this, or the Internet.
Oh, I did have a match earlier.
Um who is 79 miles away.
Well, if you start walking now, you'll get there before breakfast.
Alexis is supposed to be meeting us here.
She said she wasn't coming, but this is a bar, and she is single, so.
Well, you should warn her that we are the only people here under sixty.
Yeah, it's not not brimming with options.
No.
- Nope.
- No!
- No, it didn't feel right.
- No, it didn't.
Well, at least we tried.
I agree.
Oh, uh, I notice that man is no longer sleeping under the pool table.
Well, I'm surprisingly good at pool.
- So - Hmm!
Wait a second, is this like a reverse hustle, where you say you're good, but you're actually terrible?
Um, I don't know.
Do you wanna break?
Um, from what?
Oh, this is gonna be fun.
Don't, David.
I have nowhere else to put stuff.
It's just a checkpoint.
Okay, I've been through tons of these in Johannesburg.
It's like a drive-thru, except everybody has a gun.
When were you in Johannesburg?
I remember I'd just got my braces off, so You were 14, in South Africa?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1  They call this a candidates' breakfast?
!
Well, it can't be, Moira, there's a woman in cargo shorts.
Twyla: Good morning, Mrs. Rose.
Here's your name tag.
Oh, bless you, dear, but a name tag does not go with this ensemble.
Oh, it's just so people know who you are.
Not that people won't know, when they see you in that outfit.
It's very shiny.
You're too kind.
Well, I'm glad you talked me out of the Mohawk.
I think these people deserve a little glamour in their political campaign.
I was always impressed by those masquerade key parties at the Sarkosy's.
Roland: Hey Johnny, good morning to you.
- Roland.
- How are 'ya?
And Elvis!
I'm so glad you could make it.
Excuse me?
!
Well, because you look like Elvis in that outfit there, you know, and but the early Elvis, not the -  - Okay Roland, stop it.
Moira, all anyone can talk about is that outfit.
Hah!
You are a hit!
Huh, well no one has said as such to me.
It's just that, you know, what you're wearing is something that people around here aren't really used to, or comfortable with.
But that's what makes it great.
Oh, this is going to be a fun campaign.
- Yeah, I think it already is.
- Mhmm  Credit Bob: Hey Johnny, you know I like to keep some milk in the fridge for myself, uh and I noticed it uh - Mm, some of it was missing.
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, I do admit I used a bit of your milk, uh, to put in my coffee.
It looks more than just a bit.
I mean, the uh the whole bottle seems to be gone.
Well  Well, it was very tasty, and naturally I'll reimburse you for it.
Alright, well, give me seven bucks, we'll call it even.
- Seven dollars?
!
- It's raw milk we're talking here, it's all natural, unpasteurized, straight from the cow's breast, to your mouth.
You paid seven dollars a bottle for this?
!
- Where do you get it?
- Oh, Johnny, I I'm not giving up my supplier.
I mean, uh Unpasteurized milk is illegal.
Yeah, okay, Bob, you know, I get it, but we're not talking heroin here.
Okay well, you know, maybe you're used to being on the wrong side of the law, but I for one am not going to prison.
Gwen has already told me she won't wait for me, so I'm counting on you to be uh discreet.
Right, okay Bob, I'll keep it on the down low.
You know, if you expect me to drive you to work, it would be nice if you were ready on time.
I am ready!
I just have to get my jacket, change out of these shoes, and grab my bag.
Moira: David?
David!
David, I have an urgent campaign related question: I am approachable - Is that a question?
- Yes, the question is: I am approachable That sounds more like a fact that you're sharing with me.
Are you saying you disagree?
With your statement?
Um Well, Stevie actually is just about to drive me to work - Oh my God!
- Sorry.
So um, maybe I could give that one a think?
Stevie!
Stevie!
You're an average Joe Anne.
You must have an opinion.
- On what?
- About my approachability.
Jocelyn seemed to insinuate that I am not at one with the people.
But I've always believed that you lead with your best foot forward, and the masses will follow!
You sound a bit like a dictator.
Oh enough, David.
Stevie understands!
I'm trying to.
Yes!
As a strong willed modern woman, with a high school degree, you know how hard we have to work to be taken seriously!
I actually went to college, but sure.
I would vote for you based solely on the fact that you wore this outfit to the cafÃ© for breakfast.
Okay.
David: You know, being approachable isn't that important anyway, The queen hasn't smiled since the 70's, and her birthdays are still very well attended.
Exactly!
Wait.
What are you saying?
Nice bike!
Oh my go !
Oh my god!
- Ted?
- Alexis!
You look good.
Like, really good, like, super sun kissed, and muscle-y.
Thank you, I've been working out a bit.
And travelling, hit the beach pretty hard for a few weeks.
And boy, did it hit me back.
Good for you!
I was wondering where you ran off to.
Yeah well, it's actually kind of a funny story.
Do you remember that couples vacation that I booked for us right before you broke off our engagement?
Again, I'm-I'm super sorry about that.
No, no, it's awesome.
'Cause they actually gave me the "Broken Hearts Special".
Three extra nights at no extra charge, as long as I could prove that I didn't actually make it down the aisle.
Hmm!
Look at you, and now you have a bike!
Yeah!
Yeah, no, I got almost full price back for the engagement ring, and I've always wanted one of these, and it cost less than the ring, so Wow!
So you're in like, a really good place right now?
Yeah, well, the beach changes you.
Oh yeah.
How about you?
What's going on?
Yeah, I've just been super busy as well.
Oh.
Yeah no, I hear that.
My day's been stacked, doing rounds to some farms, checking on the animals, and now some house calls, But I gotta say, it's a lot more fun now that I've got this puppy.
Pun intended.
Look at you!
It's like if the "Sons of Anarchy" had a vet.
-  - Yeah!
Except they don't wear helmets on that show, Which I get, but, it's a little dangerous.
Anyway, it's great to see you, Alexis.
Totally.
Ooh!
Ahem!
- David!
- Jocelyn!
Hi.
Are you here picking up something for yourself?
No.
No, I um I work here now.
- Oh!
- So I usually just come here when I need to kind of freshen up my wardrobe.
I see, well, enjoy.
Just looking for a few things for the campaign.
A couple of pieces that might catch the eye.
Got it.
I've got quite the stiff competition with your mother.
- Mhmm - Of course I wouldn't want to create a conflict of interest for you.
Got it.
Well, I have brought in some pretty decent pieces to the store, you're just gonna have to search pretty hard for them, so  Twyla, I was just wondering, have you ever carried raw milk in the restaurant?
Um, that's illegal, Mr. Rose.
- Yeah.
- Between us, I had a bad experience with black market milk.
- Oh?
- Granted, I bought it from a man who I later found out was a drifter.
Anyway, it made a lot of people sick, and I am almost positive now it wasn't cow's milk.
- Okay.
- It might've been elk's milk.
Is elk's milk a thing?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm just looking for someone who sells raw milk.
From a cow.
That's a big business right now.
What's a big business right now?
- Raw milk.
- Shhh!
You would make a terrible drug dealer, Mr. Rose.
You're thinking about becoming a drug dealer?
- Ugh - I mean, I get it, it's fast money, and no one would ever suspect you.
I'm thinking of selling raw milk.
Oh.
I don't think that's right for you.
But selling drugs is?
!
Okay, I had a friend in Venice Beach who sold raw milk, and his entire compound was raided.
I mean, he also sold drugs, but like Well, I just think it can be profitable, if I can find a way to capitalize on it.
Um oh!
I just saw Ted.
Ted knows a lot of farmers, so maybe he can point you in the right direction.
Oh okay, good, good.
Good, maybe you can uh, give him a call?
Mm, I just feel like that'd be kind of awkward right now.
You know, your trail of discarded boyfriends, Alexis, is making it very difficult to get anything done - in this world.
- Okay!
I will call him.
Good, thank you.
I'll call him right after my run today.
Oh my God, okay, I'll call him right now.
- Good.
- Um How much milk do we want?
Well, let's say twelve pints.
And then, we'll see where that gets us.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Hmm Does this print come in a different colour?
Uh, theoretically.
Yeah, um is it You're look You want to have-you want that in another colour?
Maybe?
Unless you think that there's another top that might be better.
Well, I mean, there are other tops in the store.
Uh huh, okay well, maybe you could, without being specific, point me in the general direction of something that might be more suitable?
Hmm.
Well, it's not really up to me.
Um, and I am supporting my mother in this campaign.
- Oh yeah, yeah.
- But if I were you, um I might look for a a blouse maybe in in this general area.
Uh, maybe a-a skirt, and a jacket.
Maybe on this rack here.
But again, it's all - it's all you.
So Okay!
Thank you, David.
For what?
I didn't do anything.
Moira: Good afternoon, Jazzagals.
I have a great warm-up exercise I'd like to share with you.
Twyla: Oh!
Okay, I think we're just waiting for Jocelyn.
Again?
I don't know how anyone can one manage a town when they can't even manage their own time.
Well, I guess we could start without her.
Good!
Because I was thinking we should get to know each other.
Well of course, you all do know each other already, But I'd love for you to get to know me.
Does anyone have any questions?
Twyla:  I am just trying to think.
Maybe this will help break the ice?
Grace: We don't usually drink until after rehearsal.
Oh.
Uh, unless of course the drinks are free!
Jazzagals: Here, let me.
Yeah.
Open it.
Thanks.
Alexis?
What is this?
The twelve things of milk that you asked for.
The twelve "things" of milk?
I didn't ask for twelve "things" of milk, I didn't-I didn't say "things"!
No, I asked for twelve pints!
Is there one missing?
- Alexis!
- What?
These are not pints!
Pints are little bottles!
Ohhh!
Okay, 'cause I was wondering why would Dad order $300.00 worth of milk?
This cost $300.00?
!
Yeah, well like, three-ish.
I don't hmm.
Um okay well, $394.40, so I guess kind of closer to $400.
Alexis, what am I gonna do with $400.00 worth of raw milk?
!
- Sell it!
- To whom?
!
- To your customers!
- I don't have any customers!
Well then, why would you order so much milk?
I didn't!
You did!
Okay, why are you yelling at me?
Why am I yelling?
!
Ugh!
I try and do something nice for somebody, You think I would at least deserve a "thank you"!
Oh well, thank you, Alexis, thank you for ordering an insane amount of milk that I will never be able to sell!
You're welcome!
This is a lot of raw milk, Johnny.
Oh, believe me, I know.
How many times do you want me to apologize?
!
Well, try one, and let's see what happens.
Okay, I'm sorry you weren't more clear about ordering milk!
Mm, not a proper apology.
Ugh!
Okay, quiet, you two!
You're scared, all right, I get it.
That's why you came to me.
We came to you because you have a truck.
And because you know if anybody can navigate the dark underworld of the raw milk game, it's me.
You said it was a milk co-op.
Uh, it is, but these raw milk guys can be loose cannons.
Just remember, if things go south, there's a loaded BB gun in the back.
Alexis: What is that?
Roland: Oh my God, it's the cops!
Alexis: Don't stop!
No, it's nothing, it's probably an accident!
Roland: I'm gettin' out of here!
Johnny: Roland, Roland!
Alexis: Stop, it's so conspicuous!
- I know it's conspicuous!
- Close the door!
You're acting like I've never done this before!
Roland, just drive, just drive!
Drive.
Roland: Okay, okay, okay, I'm driving.
Johnny: Start driving, drive, drive, drive!
Okay?
!
- Okay, I'm driving, I'm driving!
- Alexis: Okay.
- A little quicker would be good!
- Yeah.
- I'm driving, I'm going!
- It's just a checkpoint, okay?
I've been through tons of these in Johannesburg, um, it's like a drive thru, except everybody has a gun.
When were you in Johannesburg?
!
I don't know, I remember I just got my braces off, so You were 14, in South Africa?
!
- Oh!
Oh!
- Hey Johnny, Johnny, Johnny!
If this turns into a fire fight, um you're my human shield, and we'll use her as a bargaining chip.
Yeah, okay, well, that's not gonna happen.
Okay, I think the best thing to do is just blow through the checkpoint.
Yeah, we're not blowing through anything, Alexis!
So then my Uncle Ralph marries his third wife.
What do you think her name was?
- I don't know.
- Gayle!
The man marries three Gayles!
Like didn't learn anything from the first two!
- I mean, what is that?
!
-  Jocelyn: Sorry I am late, gals, it's just been a crazy day.
Twyla: Wow, you look amazing!
Ronnie: Somebody went to the beauty salon!
Jocelyn: Oh no, this is just a little refresh.
It's very very glamorous.
So we've scrapped the whole approachable angle, have we?
Who says this has anything to do with the campaign, Moira?
Lena: I love your top, where'd you get it?
Oh, just a shop in Elmdale.
Moira: Colour me impressed.
It takes a real eye to find something of quality at a clothier in Elmdale.
Oh no, just a little bit of luck, and the right salesperson.
Any of that vodka left?
Ronnie: Oh yeah, Moira brought plenty.
And here I thought you were against this type of campaigning.
Who says this has anything to do with the campaign?
Just remember, no sudden movements, do not reach for the glove box, and not matter what happens do not tell them your real name.
- Uh huh - What?
!
Woman Officer: Turn off your truck, please.
Roland: Yes, sir.
Okay, who do we have here?
Oh, um that's uh, Jennifer.
And then he's um Jacob.
And then I'm also Jacob.
Well, you can look at our drivers' licences, if you don't believe me!
Oh, I don't think that'll be necessary, Jacob.
Yeah, I'm just joking.
We don't have drivers' licences.
Um No, yeah, we do have driver's licenses, we don't have those names on our driver's license.
Woman Officer: I'm gonna talk to someone else.
Jennifer?
Actually, my birth name is Angelica.
We're out here today checking for illegal game.
Have you folks been hunting?
Johnny: Hunting?
No, no.
We don't uh, hunt.
I mean, there's n-no hunting going on here.
No illegal yeah, you won't find any illegal game here, that's for sure.
- No!
-  So, what do you have there in the back?
Um, actually, we're just taking some milk to a co-op.
What kind of milk?
Cow milk.
So you three are dairy farmers?
- Mhmm - Yes, yes, dairy farmers.
Hard work, hard work, 'Cause you get up you know, so early, but uh But we love it.
- We do.
- You farm in that suit?
When the weather's good.
I'm gonna need you to pull over, Jacob.
- Jacob?
- Jacob.
- Jacob?
- What?
!
She wants you to pull over.
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry, I thought you were talking to the other Jacob.
Moira: David?
David, is that you?
Yeah Will you come in here a minute, please?
- Uh huh?
- You've had a long day.
Come sit.
Don't be such a prickly pear.
I just wanna check in with my son.
My first born.
-  - Mhmm So!
You're enjoying that new job of yours?
Um, it's a job.
So sure.
I was wondering what kind of customers do you get at a store like that?
Different kinds.
Different people come in.
Are they mostly locals from Elmdale, or do people travel from far and wide to benefit from the expertise of a David Rose?
Okay, well if someone is looking for my advice, then I am more than happy to provide.
- I saw Jocelyn today.
- You did?
Mhmm, she looked very different.
Mostly improved, though I must say, I didn't like the matchy matchy skirt and blazer!
No, she looked like an ageing stewardess from a Latvian airline!
I told her not to wear the jacket with the skirt, so I don't know.
And whose idea was the hair thing?
I-I may have suggested a slightly more contemporary look.
I understand, I understand.
It's water under the bridge.
Well I'm sorry, I felt very conflicted about the whole thing.
Of course you were.
Now will you be a doll, and fetch Mummy a knife?
- A knife?
- Oh, I'm sorry, I think you'll find one lodged in the middle of my back.
Okay, well, that's a lot.
And when you pull it out of my back Okay, I'm gonna take a shower.
you can plunge it into my heart!
Okay, all right.
Plunge it into my heart!
Thank you, Jacob.
Have a good day.
Well, there it goes.
$400.00 worth of milk.
I feel like this is partly my fault.
Partly?
!
Roland was the one who completely blew it back there!
Roland: What?
!
Did you not see me playing that cop?
Oh my God, she didn't know which way was up when I was done with her!
The smell of this milk is making me super nauseous.
Oh come on, guys, let's not end on a down note here, this was a good day, let's end on an up note!
Enough Roland, just get the cans in the truck, please.
Oh, okay.
I'll grab one.
Pick it up and put it on the truck!
Yes!
Oh okay.
Grab that one, put that on the truck, and then I'll organize the rest so you can grab 'em, and put 'em on the truck.
Someone has to find naked pictures of me.
Better you than a stranger in a storm cellar.
Nothing's coming up.
What search words did you use?
Your name and "nude".
Three words I thought I'd only have to type if I was held at gunpoint.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1  - Well, how's that for timing!
- What do you mean?
We both stepped out exactly together.
We didn't time this.
I know we didn't time it.
- What's your point?
- That is my point!
We-we both stepped out, and we didn't know the other person was stepping out, at exactly the same time!
Yeah, why are you yelling at me right now?
Well, I'm just explaining the good timing of this, when no explanation is needed.
It's just, it's the good timing, it's Okay fine, I don't get it, but, whatever.
Oh my God, is that David?
Oh Oh, hey.
David, where did you get this car?
Oh, this car was paid for by my employer.
We felt I needed a more efficient way to get to work.
So she bought you a car?
!
It's a rental.
Do you think I'd allow someone to buy that car for me?
Well, this-this is so great.
Thank God we have a car again!
Um, very unclear on the "we" part of that sentence.
Yeah, your brother's right, Alexis, this is his car, not ours.
We don't have a car, and he does.
Okay, are you okay?
Yes, yes, i-I'm just happy the Roses are moving up in the world.
There's a button missing on your jacket.
- What?
- Oh ew, you poor thing.
Johnny: Are those turkey sausages?
Yes.
Well, maybe, maybe I'll just sample one.
Okay.
Everything okay over here?
Yes it is, Twyla.
Just great.
If uh, if you could add this to our tab, that would be wonderful.
Add it to your tab.
Yeah, um What, is there a problem?
Unfortunately, we can't put any more on your tab, Mr. Rose.
We have a limit as to how much you can charge on it without actually making any effort to pay.
Oh, I see.
So, here's your bill.
Okay, thank you.
Just uh Leave this with me, Twyla, and I'll take care of it um This afternoon, or tomorrow.
This afternoon would be great.
Well then, this afternoon it is!
And if not, then you know, tomorrow.
Morning.
Morning.
Tomorrow morning.
Thank you!
Alexis: Um, what is going on?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
Nothing's going on.
It's just I've gotta move some money around, make sure things are liquid.
- How much trouble are we in?
- Who said we're in trouble?
I have dated enough Wall Street losers to know that "making things liquid" is not a good thing!
No, no, we're fine.
We're fine, honey.
No, no, I just had to use my unemployment check this month to pay for all the raw milk that "we" ordered.
Okay Um, well like, what can I do?
Just don't tell your mother, okay?
Or your brother, I mean, they're too fragile to handle this.
And no one really needs to worry.
Well, you might wanna tell that to your face.
Oh you are here, thank goodness!
Stevie, does this computer get Internet access?
It does.
Please log on immediately.
Okay Jocelyn has made allusions to certain Sensitive photographs from my past.
Uh, are you sure you don't want me to just leave you to do this on your own?
No, I can't type, and I don't care to relive my days as a secretary.
Oh okay.
Uh, just give me a minute, because we're only one small step above dial up here.
It's hardly surprising that Jocelyn would suddenly uncover these in the middle of a political campaign.
I suppose I just expected more from her.
Okay, there's a bunch of you with O.J. Simpson.
And you with Robert Blake.
"The top eleven photographs of Moira Rose with future murder suspects".
Well, that's not what I'm looking for!
Why were you in a paddle boat with Phil Spector?
And doesn't he looks good?
That was the one time he let me play with his hair.
It was a sunny aft you know, I shouldn't have to explain myself.
Okay well, there's a bunch here that could qualify as incriminating, so Okay.
I did a series of very tasteful nudes with Richard Avedon, in the 70's.
I see.
Um This is really not in my job description so Why aren't they coming up?
What, do you have some kind of childproof lock on this Internet?
Hm, nope, that would make my job very boring.
Oh, keep scrolling, please.
Alexis: See David, this is what happens when you wash your face with a bar of motel hand soap!
It's a zit.
People get zits.
I mean, I've always had clean, radiant skin, but I'm an anomaly.
It's not a zit, David.
I think it's just my anxiety clogging up my pores.
And forming zits.
Oh!
Ohhh my God, no!
- What is going on with you?
!
- I need to save this!
Wait, you're gonna put that on your face, after it's been on the floor?
I don't even wear good socks in here!
Okay, there are things going on right now that you don't know about.
Like what?
Like things I that can't talk about, okay?
!
I know about your dandruff shampoo.
That is preventative, and that is not what I'm talking about!
Moira: David!
David, please!
Alexis: Hey!
Wait, can you help me please?
- No, I can't help you!
- Can you help me please?
!
No!
Moira: David, it's urgent!
What is it?
Darling, I'm afraid you and I have arrived at an awkward moment in our parent/child relationship.
I'd argue that moment happens daily.
It seems that there are some nude photographs of me - on the Internet - Oh!
And I would like you to search for them.
That's a real quick no.
Um, you can ask literally anyone else.
No, I tried to ask Stevie, but her computer is several years old, and apparently quite prudish.
If someone has to find naked pictures of me, better you than a stranger in a storm cellar!
- Is it though?
- What's going on?
There are nude photos of me all over the Internet.
Um, are you sure you're not thinking of mine?
Nothing's coming up.
What search words did you use?
Uh, your name, and "nude".
Three words I thought I'd only have to type if I was held at gunpoint.
Okay, try "effervescence".
No, I'm sorry, "small umbrella".
No wait, "Siamese eels".
Alexis: Oh okay, no.
There was nothing.
I don't see anything.
You don't understand, we must find them, so we can then get rid of them!
Honestly!
Can no one find nude photos of me on the Internet?
!
- Hey!
- Hey!
Um, could I have like, a glass of water, or if there's a tap outside, or like, a hose.
- I can get you a tea.
- Thanks, Twy.
Between you and me, I know how hard it can be to pay off debt.
My Uncle Ken only has three fingers now, which is too bad, because he's deaf, and he only speaks using sign language, but He made his choices.
- Mhmm  Ted: The amount of times that I run into you in this place is like, out of a romantic comedy.
I'm sorry, what?
- Is everything okay?
- Um Yeah, totally.
I mean, I have a pimple because I washed my face with dirty hand soap, but, no biggie.
Yeah, just don't look at it.
Thanks.
One tea, on the house.
- Thanks, Twy.
- No smoothie today?
No, not today, I um, I forgot my purse at home.
Oh well, if you want a smoothie, I can get you a smoothie.
No, no, no, no, don't worry, because then I would have to pay you back, which is gonna be hard because my entire family is broke, and we can't afford to eat right now, so.
Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that.
Mhmm, me too.
Well hey, I don't know if this is something you'd be interested in, but my secretary just quit, and if you need the cash That's so sweet, but I would be uncomfortable accepting free money.
No, no, you'd be working.
Doing her job, and I would pay you for it.
Oh!
But there would be animals around all the time?
That is generally what one can expect when working at a vet clinic, yes.
Hmm!
Well, thanks for the ride.
We've really been taking advantage of those rides, haven't we?
You know, I never thought I'd be in this situation.
Getting a ride home from work by my son.
That's the situation you never thought you'd be in?
Um I need to go to Elmdale, so Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
Working man!
- Yes.
- Busy busy.
Mhmm.
You know it's funny, it didn't seem that long ago that you were relying on me for everything.
Like when you were taking your harpsichord lessons, - and I would drive you.
- I was seven.
All the lessons that I paid for, - and schooling - Okay, what is happening here?
Nothing, nothing, I'm having a little chat with my son, that's all, do I have to pay for that?
Last I heard, you didn't have to pay You and Alexis, I've been getting some very weird vibes.
What did Alexis say?
What did she say?
!
Well, she-she didn't say anything.
- Should she have said something?
- No, no.
- What is going on?
!
- It's I've over extended a little bit this month.
Financially, I-I could use some gap financing, that's all.
Well, should I be concerned?
- No, no.
- Well, how bad is it?
It's pretty bad, it's pretty bad, and you know, this is so awkward for a father - to come to a son for money.
- Well, believe it or not, this is actually not the most awkward parent/son request I've gotten today, so If you need money, I can give you money.
Well, thank you, David.
So Oh my God!
What are you doing?
Well, I was trying to give you a hug.
- I-I get the gesture.
- I should've undone the seatbelt.
Okay, well then, let's just leave it at a gesture.
- Okay, let's just leave it.
- Um yeah, let's leave it.
- High five, son.
- Uh well, okay, okay.
- All right, okay.
So, I've been thinking about the job and I have decided that I am interested.
Great!
But I would like to interview for it.
Just like everybody else.
Are you sure about that?
Because I already offered you the job.
No I know, I just, I don't want any special treatment.
And it's really important to me that I feel like I really earned this.
Okay, uh, have a seat.
Okay.
Okay Ahem!
Okay!
So Just a second.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Have you ever worked as a receptionist before?
That would be a no, but I have dealt with a lot of receptionists before, and so I feel like I have the right temperament for it.
Okay, and how are your typing skills?
Well, you've seen me text.
Mhmm and how are you at spreadsheets?
Okay, I'm just gonna stop you right there.
I'm loving this Q and A, but I think what's important right now, is my positive attitude.
And I don't wanna brag, but "Us Weekly" once described me as "up for anything".
- So - O-kay.
Yeah, great.
Well, I think that's all the information that I need for now, so thank you very much for your time, and I will be in touch.
Thank you very much for your time.
- Did I get the job?
- Yeah, yes.
You got the job.
Okay!
Okay.
You're a really good actor.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Moira: Stevie, I knew I could trust you to find them.
Stevie: The only thing is, if you want me to print it, our printer's not working.
Oh dear.
Yeah, all those online perverts should be put in a paddle boat, and sent out to sea.
No, that's not me.
That's your face.
Yes, it's my character from "Sunrise Bay," but it's been put on the body of what I can only assume is an Indonesian lady boy.
Ohhh!
I thought maybe you just had a tan.
So this is it.
Yeah, I think so.
Um, I would really rather not dive any deeper.
No, it's not necessary.
Because I ended up in some really scary, dark places of the Internet that I would rather not revisit, so I am suddenly overwhelmed with regret.
It's a new feeling for me, and I don't find it at all pleasurable.
You regret that embarrassing photos of you aren't online?
No, I regret that they're lost.
They were the one perfect memorial to who I once was.
And I should've appreciated those firm round mammae, and Callipygian ass, while I had them.
If you're talking about your body, uh I think you still look amazing.
Then allow me to offer you some advice.
Take a thousand naked pictures of yourself now.
You may currently think, "oh, I'm too spooky".
Or, "nobody wants to see these tiny boobies".
But believe me, one day you will look at those photos, with much kinder eyes and say, "dear God, I was a beautiful thing"!
- Will I?
- Mhmm.
Oh, and make sure you submit those photos to the Internet.
Otherwise, your own children will go looking for them one day and tragically, they won't be there.
Okay, so how much money do you need?
And please keep in mind that I had a negative balance in there last week.
Yeah, whatever you can spare.
You know, a couple hundred, three Four Okay, how much do you actually need, though?
$560.00 so my entire paycheck, then.
Okay.
- What just happened?
- I don't know.
It says there's an error with your pin.
- I can see that!
I can see that!
- All right.
- All right, calm down, calm down.
- I can see that!
You only get a few chances here.
I just must've typed in the pin number wrong.
It's actually just "pin," you don't have to say, "pin number," that's redundant.
Okay, okay, wow, are you doing this right now?
!
Sorry, sorry, sorry, go ahead.
What is going on?
!
All right, first of all, just stop for one second, because you've only got one more chance at this, all right?
So focus on the numbers!
I know my number!
It's the same pin number that I've had for years!
The same "pin"!
Okay, can you just take a take a big step!
Thank you so much!
All right, remember, this is your last chance!
Arghhh!
- What just happened?
- Well, it ate my card.
- Well, press eject!
- There's no eject on this machine!
Well, what this?
There's eject.
That's "cancel," that doesn't do anything!
All right, press the green one!
- I'm pressing "cancel," - Okay, nothing happens!
- Well, press something else!
- What do you want me to do?
!
- Get the card back!
- We can't get the card back!
- Why?
-  Wow!
So I was able to retrieve it, and it looks like this is a new card.
Thank you, yeah, it is a new card.
Did you use the proper pin?
Yeah, that's what I asked him.
Of course I used the proper pin.
I know my pin number, it's my birthday.
Happy Birthday!
No, the pin number is my birthday.
He keeps saying pin number.
Did you start with the temporary pin that we sent you?
What?
What temporary pin?
- Ah, see?
- No "see"!
None of that, listen!
I phoned someone here, a teller, I think, who told me that I didn't need a temporary pin number!
Oh, which teller?
Because it's only me and Carol here.
It was a while ago.
It says the account was opened last week.
Okay, I just need to take out some money for my dad.
Um, because my family is in debt.
So if you could help me help him, that would be a wonderful thing.
Of course, I just need you to pick a new pin.
Okay.
It's 7-2-8-3.
Sir, you just said your pin out loud.
So I suggest you pick another one.
- What about my birthday?
- No!
- It's easy.
- It's not easy.
Nothing's easy about this.
Okay, where what?
I never saw myself having like, a normal job.
But I think it's gonna be kinda nice to make money and stuff, and like, help out a bit more.
You're working for your ex.
David, Ted wouldn't have hired me if he thought it was a bad idea!
Ted also proposed to you twice, so I'd say Ted's decision making skills are a little suspect.
Okay, well I will have you know that I went through the same interview process as everybody else.
He asked me several questions, most of which I answered.
Oh my God!
Well kids, you'll never guess what I just found outside.
My button!
Things are looking up!
Alexis: I have something for you.
Oh, Alexis, you didn't have to do this.
Open it.
Oh, honey.
"My deepest condolences"?
"I know things have been tough lately, but I'm here for you, and hope this helps.
Love, Alexis".
Was there supposed to be something in here?
In where?
In the card?
What do you mean?
Oh, it's just the card.
Yeah, I thought you could use some support.
- So - Ohhh!
-  - Wow!
That was really beautiful.
And very generous.
- Thank you.
- Both my kids are generous.
And I'm one very grateful dad.
Very grateful.
Awww!
Bring it in, big guy.
Yeah, I don't know if that's something I wanna do right now.
David, Dad's poor right now!
He's not poor anymore!
Because someone gave him more than a cheap card!
- Okay, okay, that's enough.
- Okay.
Oh.
Moira: What's-what's this about?
I was just uh hugging my kids.
Why?
- I found my button.
- Alexis got a job.
- Alexis got a job!
- Yeah.
- Alexis?
Oh, how wonderful!
- Yeah!
Wow Alexis, look at you!
Just starting out on a shiny new future!
Whew!
Okay, good night, kids.
I'm gonna get changed.
Okay, sure.
You know, all things considered Moira I'd say we have a couple of pretty great kids.
Mhmm.
They say it's through our children that we stay young.
But I haven't seen much effort on their part.
You're still thinking about those photos.
Oh, I can't help it, John.
The last traces of my juvenescence vanished into thin air.
Well, perhaps they're not the last traces.
What does that mean?
Why don't you look in my folio?
Inside pocket.
Oh, you dirty dog!
Well, what can I say?
When did you take this?
Greece, 1987.
Oh, I loved those earrings.
And that skin.
And that hair.
I'm no Avedon honey, but I would say you still look pretty spectacular.
And that's all that counts.
Now how do I get this on the Internet?
John!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 - Morning!
- Hey!
How are you?
- Oh!
- Good morning!
Hi.
Oh, just continue on inside.
Well, I hope we didn't catch the two of you with your pants down.
- Oh - I'm just joking, I can see they're on.
No, we actually listened outside to make sure.
We just brought some leftovers by.
We had a little thing at the house last night and we didn't want all the food to go to waste, so.
Yeah, and you know what?
We would have invited the two of you but it was kind of a Political schmooze-fest.
A lot of pressing of the flesh, and greasing palms, that kind of thing, you know.
It wasn't as much fun as it sounds.
Oh well, who wants an invitation to big soiree when you can be met the very next morning with some table scraps.
You know, people were talking about you too, Moira.
Oh, they were talking about the other candidate?
Yes!
You know, I can't wait for this whole thing to just be over so we can all just hang out again.
- Yeah, yeah - Mm-hmm.
Well, we are off to the bank.
We've got lots of donations that we need to deposit.
- Well, thank you.
Bye!
- Bye!
Those two are not as simple minded as we thought.
He is.
David, Ted said that I had to wear scrubs, but what does that mean really?
Um, I think it means you have to wear scrubs.
Ugh.
I know but look at me.
You look amazing.
Who designs these things?
!
Whatever happened to empowering women's sexuality?
I don't think sex appeal is the guiding principle behind nursing uniforms.
Obviously you've never been out for Halloween, David.
So are you nervous?
This is like the first job you've ever had.
No it isn't.
Putting your name on a line of edible nail polish isn't what I would call having a job.
I was very hands on, David.
I came up with all the flavours by myself.
Even the one that poisoned all those people?
David, the factory in Guangzhou assured us that it was lead-free.
Ugh!
Anyway, I'm actually really looking forward to this.
You look like a stick of gum.
Like what?
David!
Well how much did she take?
Um, I'm gonna go get a latte.
Do you need anything?
She's an IT manager, Gerald.
She makes more money than both of us combined.
I shouldn't be worrying about these things.
I would love a hot tea.
Okay.
Um Is everything okay?
Yup.
Just chatting.
Listen, let me give you some cash for that.
I don't think that expense card is long for this world.
Mm, okay.
It's just I have, um, four more taxidermy peacocks coming this afternoon.
Oh, I can pay cash for those.
That's fine.
Don't answer that.
It's either Gerald or the school and I can't deal with either right now.
Okay.
Um, this is really intense, so I'm gonna go get that tea.
You're a doll.
You're a doll!
Hey!
Sorry I'm a bit late.
Um, I wasn't sure what the etiquette was for this kind of thing, so I walked around the block a little bit.
Oh, you can show up early, or on time.
Early is probably even better.
Okay, great.
Alexis, you wanted to be treated professionally, so I have to ask, where are the rest of your scrubs?
Oh.
I thought this was kind of an either/or thing.
No, they come as a set.
That's why I gave you both.
Those bare legs are dangerous.
Ted!
No, I'm serious.
The animals carry bugs or ticks that can burrow into your bare skin.
Ew!
Don't worry, we'll just have you focus on filing for today.
Um, okay.
Awesome!
Thank you.
So many files!
I'll just dive right into this.
You won't even miss your last secretary once I get finished with these puppies.
Good news!
I found you a loaner pair.
Helen must have left them.
Phew.
Thank you, Ted.
Those are just perfect.
Hello!
Ronnie!
Hello you!
You're looking well today!
New khakis I see.
Are you enjoying your coffee?
I was.
I'm going to presume you were at Jocelyn's thing last night.
How was that?
- Good.
Lots of dairy.
- Oh, yes.
If anyone knows how to put a lactose intolerant in the hospital, it's our Jocelyn.
Moira, is there something I can do for you?
Yes, thank you!
Ronnie, I was wondering whether or not you have decided on a candidate to endorse?
- Not yet.
- Oh!
Good.
Why is that good?
I'm hoping I might persuade you to put your weight behind me.
Political weight.
I now realize 'clout' was the word I was looking for.
What makes you think I'd vote for you?
You are a sensible woman, Ronnie, and you speak your mind.
I-i can feel your frustration with Roland.
Now imagine his wife on council, strengthening his agenda - And?
- And, were I on council, I could support your agenda.
We could support each other's agendas.
Well, I don't hate what you're saying, so here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna invite some of my girl friends over and if you can get on the good side of these women, let's just say you'd be locking down a key demographic.
It's a date.
No.
No, it's not.
I wouldn't call it that.
No, i-i didn't I didn't mean - Uh!
Just - No, I - Thank you.
- Okay.
Thank you, Ronnie.
Um, Doris, that is so exciting!
Love him for you!
I don't know.
I mean, poor Albert's allergic to cats.
But I can't leave Mittens alone.
So how do I spend time with Albert?
Veterinary clinic, how can I help you?
Can I put you on hold?
Okay, so if there's one thing I learned, is that when it comes to love you cannot let little things get in your way.
Like I once dated this sultan's nephew who was forbidden to talk to me or even to look at me and we made it work for like half a regime change, so - You what?
- I know.
- Uh, Alexis, - Yes.
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.
We're gonna put this on pause.
The doctor needs me.
- Yes?
- So how's the filing coming?
I have been swamped.
Doris's cat is like totally high maintenance.
Yeah, well, Doris has been worried about her cat for two years.
She comes in every week.
Okay, well, what am I supposed to do?
Poor thing is like desperate for a man.
And, uh, why are there three calls on hold?
Um I don't know, someone hung up?
Okay, Alexis, there is more to the job than just keeping the customers happy, all right?
This is a place of business and right now, there are clients waiting to talk to me.
Are you sure that you're cut out for this?
- Mm.
- Okay.
'Kay.
Well, look, I-I can't talk about this now, I have to go.
I just wanted to let you know that we just sold one of the leather ponchos.
Oh, we're selling leather ponchos now?
Well, that doesn't sound cheap.
No, it's not, which is why it's so exciting that we just sold one.
- That's fabulous, David.
- It is.
Um, so I was gonna go, unless needed me for something else.
That was Gerald and now I have a meeting at the school tomorrow and I've got no one to take care of my stepdaughter.
His ex-wife certainly won't do it.
Wow well, if there's anything I can do, just I need someone to take care of my stepdaughter.
Okay.
Well, if there's anything I can do, just I need you to take care of my stepdaughter.
'Kay, I don't think that's a very good idea.
I'm gonna drop her off at four.
I'm looking forward to it.
You're a doll.
I brought you some trail mix, but I spilled it in my purse.
So sweet of you, Doris.
Thank you.
Hey, I was thinking about what you said yesterday and, um, I think Now is not a good time.
Okay.
Um how are things with Mittens?
Uh he-he's dead.
Ew!
I'm just trying to figure out what happened, all right?
Okay.
Um, well, what am I supposed to tell Doris?
Don't say anything to her.
Just keep her company while I figure this out, okay?
Okay, so I'm just supposed to act like nothing happened?
- Yeah, for now.
- Okay.
Um, how am I supposed to do that?
- Alexis.
- Okay.
Yeah.
'Kay.
Hi!
Um do you have any like DVDs or like a dusty old board game I could borrow?
Oh, usually we reserve those for our platinum members.
Mhmm.
Oh, but I do have a Rummoli box filled with puzzle pieces on the shelf there.
Sounds like something you'd find at a serial killer's house.
Hmm.
Big night planned?
Um, I am babysitting tonight, so You're joking.
Mm-mm.
I wish I was joking.
But you hate kids.
Mm-hmm.
That's correct.
- Oh my God.
Can I watch?
- No.
- Or video tape?
- No, you no.
- Can I bring friends?
- No.
My boss's life is a bit of a mess right now, so I said I'd help out by babysitting her stepdaughter.
And you're sure you can do this on your own?
Mm-hmm.
Um, 'cause I'm a fully capable human being.
Um, if you happen to find any Xanax Lying around anywhere, can you just Let me know about that?
I-I think I might just pick up these treats while I wait.
Oh um, yeah, no, um But these treats are actually gonna go on sale next week, so maybe you just wanna hold off until then?
Well, I think he'd really like them.
Yeah I'm sure he would really like them If he wasn't dead.
- What?
- Yeah, he's dead.
But!
But the good news is, you're not.
Mittens is dead?
Yeah.
But um But you're free, Doris, and, in a way, so is Mittens.
- Oh.
What happened?
- We're not sure yet, but I think that the important thing is that Mittens is no longer suffering.
Oh, what do I do now?
Do I put him in a box?
Bury him?
Ew!
No, we don't have to talk about that right now, okay?
I know this is hard.
But, um, the upside, um The upside Oh!
Is that Albert from the down the hall can now come over for dinner without worrying about his allergies threatening his life.
Hey.
I think it's time that we find you a new love of your life.
It's okay.
John, wait.
I didn't tell you earlier because I didn't want you to back out on me, but you're going to be the only man here this evening.
Well, I think I can handle that.
Mm-hmm?
Ronnie told me that her friends represent a key demographic and I don't believe it's women with husbands.
- Oh - Mm-hmm.
I feel really good about this, and I think you just approach these women like you did Paula, our landscaper.
Very strong, very forceful.
- Oh!
- Hello, Ronnie.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Come in both of you.
We're counting down the top 100 hottest stars in Hollywood.
From this Canadian Has that actress had work done too?
Um, yeah, you can always tell because their upper lip sort of I mean, like, puffs a bit.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Do you want more coffee?
- Yes, please.
Okay, so we've run out of sugar.
Um, do you want it still because I don't really.
This star has everyone wondering How will that face turn out?
Well, folks, take a look at her now!
You okay?
I'm fine - Are you sure?
- Something happened.
What?
!
Nothing.
Just d-don't look on the bed.
The self-described tom-boy Has become a serious star on the rise, which is why we've named her number - It's okay!
- On our hot list!
Needless to say, that was the last time I played charades with Fran Leibovitz.
Oh, this is wonderful.
Wonderful!
And I would love to regale you all night with entertaining anecdotes, but I would be remiss if I didn't outline some of my policies for this community of remarkable women.
Moira, could I have a word?
Excuse us, ladies.
Family matter.
I knew I should've left him home with the sitter.
Moira, I have a feeling not every woman here is a lesbian.
Oh, John, you love to think women are flirting with you.
No, I was just talking someone over there who has a husband.
A male husband.
Everything all right?
Yes.
Ronnie, when mentioned earlier that I might lock down a key demographic this evening, you meant what?
Entrepreneurs.
Everyone here is a member of the women's business association.
Oh.
Business association.
Yes, that's what I I think we're all ready when you are.
All I'm missing is my teleprompter!
- Business association.
- Yes, I heard her.
Oh God.
You know, I have to say that I'm impressed.
It's not everyone who can tell an old woman that her cat is dead, and set up a love connection, and sell our most expensive marble urn in the same three-minute conversation.
Well, I'm not totally sure about the love connection.
I'm still waiting for Doris to text me back.
- Right.
- So.
Uh, was there something that you wanted to say to me?
- What?
- Uh, just earlier, it seemed like you were trying to tell me something.
Oh!
No, I think it was about, um, vacation days.
- Ah.
- Yeah, you had mentioned two weeks.
So I guess I was just wondering, um, how many two-week vacations are available per year?
Well, tell you what, why don't we start with one and then we'll just go from there.
Okay.
Yeah.
That could work.
- Great.
- Great.
Honestly?
Nothing is more natural Um, aside from maybe the thread count in these sheets, but that's okay!
'Cause you're a woman now!
Um, and nothing about that is embarrassing.
I'm not embarrassed, I'm scared!
I mean, you were talking so much about your high thread count linens Yeah.
Well, I think it's gonna come out.
And how they were made by Egyptians or something?
No, I'm well aware of that.
Um, so So, uh, I think my sister has some wonderful products in there for you.
Uh, health accessories, so feel free to help yourself to those.
Um okay.
Uh So you can just tie that around your waist, okay?
Yeah, thank you.
Mmm okay.
Equality.
Freedom.
Marriage.
These are the rights of every community, and even more specifically The business community.
No faction of society deserves to be discriminated against, especially women who Are in business faction.
One of my top priorities will be to To change people's misguided and ignorant perceptions of women like you.
You did not choose this life!
No, each one of you was born to be an entrepreneur.
Why don't I open up the floor to some of your concerns?
I want to elect someone who understands the pressures of working and raising a family.
Very nice, yes.
I love that.
- Working and ?
- Raising a family.
And raising a family.
Well, John, my husband will back me up on this, I had a six-and-a-half season career as an actress in television, which I put on hold to devote all my time and energy to raise two million dollars for charity.
And two children.
Oh, yes, and two children.
Hmm?
And on top of that, I managed a staff of twelve.
You ran your own business?
Household staff, yes.
Ronnie says you've only lived here a year?
That's true, Ronnie, thank you, but I am a quick study.
Karen, I learned tonight that you run a gravel business, yes, and you, Audrey, you manage a team of accountants, and you, Tara, you're very concerned about your inverted nipples.
Which I assumed was public domain; there were a lot of you around when she told.
Well, ladies, I'm-I'm not that different from any of you.
I had my first job at the age of ten, sweeping up hair in a beauty salon.
I will never forget the value of a hard day's work.
Believe me when I tell you, if elected, I will put just as much work into my time on council as you women put into your businesses every day.
Oh, being in business myself, I've attended quite a few of these functions, and this one was quite the success.
Yeah, I think your wife's gonna do okay.
Well, she pulled it off, didn't she?
Considering she came in - well, we both did - - thinking everyone was - Black?
No.
I mean that everyone was leaning - Younger?
- John, we should go.
No, what I mean is that, uh, that I am very comfortable seeing women with other women.
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, that didn't come out right.
I M-Moira and I have been very, very supportive of the LGBTQ community.
- Oh, John John.
- For Did I leave out a letter?
Thank you so much, Ronnie.
I love your friends and I really loved that dip.
Oh, the dip was incredible, really, for men and women.
That's good night.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
1   Oh, there's a woman in here Who couldn't afford a Persian rug, so she painted one on her tiled floor.
The magazine is celebrating her ingenuity!
Well, it sounds like a creative solution.
A creative solution would be a lobotomy to make one forget they like nice things.
It's all so bleak.
Goodnight, John.
Sleep well, sweetheart.
Just keep it inside David, could you turn that down, please?
As if you think that's what I listen to!
David, Alexis, turn the music down!
- It's coming from the other side!
- What?
We almost had it all - Don't cry out loud -  Could you turn the music down, please?
!
Just keep it inside And learn how to hide your feelings  Hello?
!
We're trying to sleep in here!
Stop yelling!
I'm trying to turn the music down!
Stop banging on the wall!
David, stop yelling at your father!
Hello?
!
Why is everybody screaming?
!
Alexis, enough!
The music's too loud!
Then get them to turn it down!
Well, that's what I'm trying to do!
John.
John!
John, do you have any idea what a terrible night's sleep does to one's face?
What, you couldn't sleep?
How could I sleep with that noise?
!
What noise?
They turned it off.
No, you you just fell asleep, and stayed asleep with no regard for my well being.
Now my eyes are puffy.
Are they puffy?
No, they look like they usually look, Moira.
So now my eyes are usually puffy!
Oh Moira, they're fine!
These bags are like gypsy caravans, packed to the brim!
Don't cry out loud Oh my God, this can't be happening.
All right, I'll take care of it.
Learn how to hide your feelings - Fly high and proud -  Could you turn the music down, please?
!
My wife hasn't slept all night!
Oh!
Hey, Johnny.
- Roland!
- Hey, uh - Yeah.
- What are you doing here?
Well, we're, uh, doing some renos on the uh, house, so we're gonna shack up here until they're all done.
Um honey, don't hog all the hot water, okay?
- Thank you.
- Jocelyn's here?
Y-yeah, no, Johnny's here.
Yeah, yes, I will say hi to him for you.
Jocelyn says hi, John.
You didn't hear us last night?
- Nope.
- Banging away?
Now, whatever you and the missus do after hours, that's your business, not mine.
On the walls Roland, with our fists!
And if you're into that kind of stuff, that doesn't bother me at all.
- All right, stop, stop!
- That is fine.
What?
- Stop it!
What are you doing here?
!
- Oh!
I told you, our basement flooded.
You said "renovations".
Yes renovations, because our basement flooded!
What?
Yes, you're absolutely right, honey, it is time that we asked Johnny to leave.
So Johnny, I think you should Is Jocelyn really there?
Did you hear that, sweetheart?
He doesn't think you're really here.
Would you please tell him?
- Thank you!
Satisfied?
- Jocelyn?
Okay look, Johnny, unless you have a warrant, okay?
Jocelyn and I are gonna be shutting our door now.
- Jocelyn?
- Okay, that's fine.
So you think Jocelyn's at the root of this?
Yeah well, I think obviously they they they they had a they had a fight, Moira.
You know, I just don't know how she puts up with him.
And now he's living next door.
I've never pretended to like this motel, but at least it provided a buffer between us, - and those people!
- Yeah How long do you think he'll be here?
Well, I hate to think.
Oh God, this is the last thing we need, John.
We're barely hanging on as it is!
Well, what does that mean, Moira?
"We're barely hanging on"?
!
I mean living in a space this limited, is trying enough on a marriage without having Roland wallowing next door.
This is going to bring us to a breaking point!
Oh Moira, it's not gonna bring us to the breaking point.
I think we've done an amazing job since we've been here.
I mean, I barely remember an argument between us!
That's my point.
In a room this tiny, we've just got to ignore the little irritants of the other, or you'd go insane!
Little irritants?
What uh What little irritants?
I have little irritants?
Yes, we all do.
Peccadilloes, cloying habits.
Like what, for instance?
All right, John.
I I drink a little too much tea sometimes.
And that's it for you?
You uh You drink tea?
Well, it calms me, so I suppose you would say that's because I'm inclined to get nervous or insecure.
No, I would say you're sometimes a little defensive, and uh, perhaps a tad paranoid.
That would only be after you've taken that condescending father tone with me.
- Father tone?
- There it is.
You think I have a father tone?
John, I wish you could hear yourself talk.
But of course you never do.
And that's the other thing I guess, I never listen to myself?
Look, it's by not engaging in this kind of tit-for-tat that we keep our marriage afloat.
And you have no faults, other than drinking tea?
!
John, I just admitted that I can get a little defensive.
But only when you act like a big child!
I act like a child?
Yes John, and now is not the time for you to throw one of your tantrums!
Moira, of the two of us, I'm not the one who throws tantrums!
I will not engage.
I do not want to see him get the better of us.
And I'm sorry, obviously this has worked you up into some kind of fit of pique.
Okay, you know what?
I need some air.
That's another thing Mr. Rose, you never finish your fights.
Oh, this one's finished!
Stevie, you look like you would know about affordable housing.
Is this legit?
Uh it's an ad for an apartment.
I know, it's cute though, right?
I wouldn't really describe any apartment as cute in this town.
Hi Um, hi.
There's a collection of undershirts hang drying outside of my room.
Um, is there any way they could be removed, or is there like, a Texas Chainsaw movie being filmed out there that I'm not aware of?
Actually, Roland is staying here for a few days.
- Ew.
- That's disgusting.
What's going on over here?
Let me see that.
What is this?
"Charming studio apartment for rent in lower SC".
What's "lower SC"?
I thought this town was just one long street.
I am thinking about getting a place.
I have some money coming in, and it's just It's not really a cute look to be this age, and live at home.
No offense, David.
Okay, it's not like I have a lot of say in the matter.
M'kay well, you're a full grown man, - who's much older than me, - Hmmm.
- living at home.
So it's just a little - Mm-hmm.
- bit embarrassing.
- Mmm, "available immediately".
I wonder if you could move out tonight?
Uh no, because I'm gonna be using my half of the room as a guest bedroom.
Ooh, better yet, you could sublet it.
I'm sure there's plenty of vagrants looking for temporary housing.
Speaking of which, David, I'm gonna need you to come and look at the apartment with me.
Okay, why would I do that?
Because David, as an attractive, single female, I don't feel comfortable going to look at an apartment by myself!
Well, what if the person who's showing you the apartment is like, a super cute single real estate guy?
Mmmm that person doesn't exist in this town.
Okay, well, if that's the case, then David, you have to come with me.
And if I like the place, then you can have the whole motel room to yourself, okay?
Okay.
She's nuts.
Um, if you could just figure out the undershirt situation, there's just so many of them, and it's a lot for me.
- Bye!
- You know, for my eyes.
Mm-hmm.
- Hey, Johnny.
- Oh, Jocelyn.
Hi.
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.
- Really?
- Yes.
I couldn't help but notice that you seemed a little sad sack-y today.
Sad sack-y?
Well, maybe that's because your husband is occupying the room next to us at the motel.
I thought he might end up there.
That's where we had our honeymoon.
Had a lot of great times in that room.
I don't think this is one of them.
He was playing "Don't Cry Out Loud", loud at two in the morning.
I'm so sorry.
It's our wedding song.
It was actually the first song that we ever made Okay, I really don't need the details on that.
Listen, I would ask you to sit, - but I I am not - Absolutely, yes!
So - you two are - Yeah.
- going through a little bit of a thing?
- Had a tiff, and uh, I just said, I need some space.
Well, I'm glad you have your space, and I'm glad Roland has his space, I'll tell you who's now having a major problem - with their space.
- Okay, Johnny.
Sometimes it's a lot easier to blame others than it is to maybe kinda turn it inwards on ourselves, isn't it?
Meaning Well, it's kinda obvious that you and Moira are a little bit rocky right now.
No, no, things are not rocky.
Things are not rocky, and if they are, it's because your husband - is driving us insane!
- So you're telling me that there are no issues - between you two right now?
- No!
No!
No issues.
Well, by "issues," if you mean p-peccadilloes, - if you mean little irritants.
- Mmmm.
Maybe.
- Uh-huh.
- But uh no, we're - we're good.
- Good.
Err, right this way.
As you can see, it's light and breezy.
And by breezy, I mean there's a slight but steady draft I'm told you only notice in the winter.
This is so cute for me.
Oh, and there's a lovely window here through which you can see all of the town.
The cafe, the garage, a tree of some kind just uh, over there.
This is cute, right?
I think this is super cute.
Wait, is it cute?
'Cause I know that it's light, and spacious, and airy in here, but I just wasn't sure if it was cute.
Oh, it's cute.
Are these original moldings?
Yes, but we can rip those out.
Okay well, I'm the one that should be asking the questions.
Okay, be my guest.
Okay, so When does um Is this a functioning fireplace?
Yes, we found an incinerated squirrel carcass there last week.
- Ah.
- Um, what are you doing, David?
You wanted my help, so I'm helping.
Mm, okay.
What's the rent?
Uh, they want $275, but I think they're dreaming.
- A week?
- No, no, no, a month.
But again, I think we can talk them down.
Wait, $275 a month for this?
That's cheaper than my P.O. Box in New York.
Do you think I should take it?
Well, I mean, it is it is very old.
I think that I would like to see the lease agreement.
I thought you'd never ask!
Ugh, you know, it actually kind of reminds me of your old um office space that you had in the West Village.
- Mm-hmm.
- Remember?
- Yep!
- So cute.
You know what I think brought all this on?
That darn election!
It's really hard on couples.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I really appreciate how involved Roland wants to be in my campaign, it's just that sometimes, he can be sooo - Irritating?
Obnoxious?
- No.
I was gonna say sensitive.
- Oh, sensitive.
- Especially when I wanna do something on my own.
Ohhh!
Do you really think he's obnoxious and irritating?
No!
No, no, no, I was just trying to imagine - what you know, you were feeling, no.
- Well, I feel frustrated a lot.
You know, you try to have a rational conversation with him, and he just gets all like, stubborn and selfish.
And then he acts like you're the one behaving like - a child!
Right?
Yeah, exactly.
- Exactly!
Words get get used, and twisted around, and yet, he uses that against you.
- Yes, that is so Roland!
- And you get the reputation for being hot-headed, and he gets to push every button he can!
You are so right!
You know, I thought that I might be ready to forgive him, but I think he needs a couple more nights at that motel.
But, on the other hand maybe it's through your forgiveness that you teach him a lesson.
Right, and and the sooner you forgive him, then then the better it's gonna be for for you.
- Don't cry out loud -  Roland!
Roland!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh!
Moira, this isn't a good time, um Jocelyn and I are about to make brunch.
You can give up the act.
You and I need to talk.
Close the door honey, will you?
You're lettin' my flies out.
Ugh!
It's time for you to go home and apologize.
Oh, okay.
I'll do that.
Um Just one question.
Where's Johnny?
I imagine he's at work.
'Cause he seemed pretty angry this morning.
I don't know, maybe you need to go home and apologize.
Sorry sweetheart, these walls are pretty thin.
Oh yes, I know.
The only reason John and I had words is because we were exhausted, - from being kept up all night!
- Mmm.
It seems someone in the motel was playing loud music until 4 A.M.!
I'm sorry, are you complaining about the quality of the free lodging that I arranged for you this past year?
I think we're very courteous guests, Roland, and have tried to contribute to this town, in whatever way we could.
This town, which is quite frankly, woefully mismanaged.
Oh, ugh, ew!
I hate that!
Eww!
That is just the kind of arrogance that I can't stand!
You come in here, and you think you know everything!
Oooh!
Ohhhh!
No, but I think if I was in your position, I would be open to new ideas.
Oh!
Right!
Of course you would.
- I would!
- Sure.
Hah!
Yeah.
Mmmm  Hello, everyone!
I'm Moira Rose, and I know famous people, so I really can't talk to the common folk.
Excuse me all, coming through!
So I'm assuming this place comes fully furnished?
No, this is all completely staged.
Hmm, it must be very expensive to furnish a place like this.
Ah, not really if you get it second hand.
Or uh, maybe you get up early on Tuesdays, which is garbage day, and find a discarded couch or sofa.
Mm-hmm, um well, you know what, I don't even really need that much stuff.
I kinda like the minimalist look anyway, so.
It's very quiet in here, Ray, it's like, alarmingly quiet.
The apartment was soundproofed by the previous owner.
But the irony is the people next door are completely deaf, so you could literally scream for hours, and no one would hear you.
Did you hear that?
You could scream for hours, and no one would hear you.
Okay well, think about how much fun that will be for parties, David.
Um, and what about parking?
Okay, you don't you don't even have a car!
Oh my god, if you want the place so badly, David, - why don't you just say it?
!
- Who says I want it?
So you don't want it?
- No.
- So if I said that I didn't want the place, you wouldn't you wouldn't want it?
- Okay, so you don't want the place?
- Okay, I'm just trying to figure out if - you want the place!
- Oh, okay, okay.
I think I know what all the hesitation is about.
Yes, someone did take their own life in this space, but the good news is, we've replaced the ceiling fan, it's now a break-away model.
And to answer your question, yes, there is parking.
Uh, oh, and they also allow cats.
Oh?
Oh?
You wanna drop the gloves?
Let's drop the gloves, Roland.
You are an emotionally stunted, self absorbed man-child.
You lord this counterfeit power of yours over others like a schoolyard bully!
Okay, well you're a phony baloney blowhard, who's desperately scared of being thought of as a regular person!
I used to be a regular person!
You're just a stuck up pencil skirt with clown makeup, and a janitor's mop on your head!
You are an inexplicably cocky imbecile!
Your marriage is as blighted as this town, and you have no one to blame but yourself!
- Whoa - Oh.
- Well, hold on.
- I went too far.
- Yeah.
- Well - Well, I mean, come on.
- In the spirit of things.
Yeah but still, that was kind of over the line.
-  - I like Jocelyn, And I know you two have a very special relationship.
Well, we I mean, we have our differences.
Oh God, who doesn't?
I was I was just riffing.
John?
Oh sweetheart, I didn't mean to wake you.
Don't hear any music next door.
No, I think he tuckered himself out.
Oh, well, that's good, that's good.
I suppose he just needed to spout off for a while.
Yeah well, Jocelyn will be glad to hear that.
She just came to pick him up.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I think she just needed some alone time, you know, to clear her head.
That's understandable.
Hmm.
It's unfortunate they can't communicate those needs to each other.
Yeah well, they don't have what we have.
I can't argue with that.
Don't cry out loud I thought you said Jocelyn came back to make up!
She did!
That happens to be their wedding song.
Just admit that you wanted the place.
I was just asking questions to help you make the right decision.
Well, you're a terrible liar, David.
It's a pretty good deal, though.
Seriously though, would you wanna live in a house where someone killed themselves?
I could almost guarantee you that someone's killed themselves in this room.
Ew, David!
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.
Ugh!
You know, sometimes at night, I see things.
Oh my God, David!
Yeah, yeah.
Like dark things.
Like sometimes there's this old woman that paces back and forth by your bed, waving her hands over your face.
I don't think her bony fingers ever touch your mouth, though.
Mom?
Do you ever wake up with chapped lips?
Dad!
Dad's dead.
Ohh, you're such a dick, David!
Stop!
This is the number that we are after.
Now if you'll excuse us, we have another meeting to get to.
We're in our store.
We await your reply.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1 - John!
- Oh, I was starting to think I've been hijacked.
- What?
- My campaign has been hijacked.
Oh, I need some tea.
Twyla?
What's going on?
- Tea?
- No thank you.
Ugh!
My campaign signs have gone missing.
- What?
- You had election signs?
- Yes!
All of them!
Gone!
- Wow.
Maybe people were mowing their lawns.
Well, it's probably just kids.
What if there's a more sinister explanation?
Oh, like the wind.
I was wondering if there's someone who's thinking, "Oh, this woman may not have many signs, but she has myriad qualities worth voting for.
I must stop her"!
So you think the signs were stolen?
Stolen?
Ew!
Is that what you think happened?
Well, isn't that what you were implying?
- Who would do that?
- Well, I don't know.
It's dirty pool.
You can't sabotage someone's campaign and take their signs.
Please, please, everyone calm down!
Well, I suppose if there's a silver lining in all this, it's that Someone is imitated enough into thinking that I might be affecting this town's long-established voting patterns.
Johnny: Oh good.
Good.
Now the playing field is more fair.
Yeah, I was worried Jocelyn didn't have enough signs up.
Ah.
You and me both, pal, but, luckily, I'm a step ahead of ya.
Okay, enough with the signs, Roland.
It was overkill a week ago.
Well, I don't know about you, Johnny, but I would like my little lady to win this campaign.
Oh!
Well, funny you should mention, because my little lady had all of her lawn signs disappear.
Oh.
Moira had lawn signs?
She had a few.
Now she has none.
Wait.
Are you saying that I had something - I'm not pointing any fingers, - Uh-huh.
But if I find out you had anything to do with this, even though you're acting like you don't Well, if I find out that you're accusing me of doing something I didn't do, then I'm going to accuse you of making false accusations.
Fine.
But if you're denying doing something you might have done and making me feel guilty For accusing you of something you claim you didn't do Ooh, is that a threat?
I think so.
Because I don't wanna tell you how I respond to threats.
And I don't wanna tell you how I respond to illegal political activity.
Okay, fine, then don't.
Fine, I won't.
Maybe.
Oh dear God.
Yes.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.
Well then, take it out of my savings account.
Well, what about the air miles?
Can you put some of them towards the electricity bill?
Okay, this signage, is not really on brand.
It's not ridiculous.
Well, I'm not having this conversation either.
-  - Is everything okay?
David, to be honest, I'm having a little trouble financially and I'm gonna have to let you go.
- What?
- It seems I have overshot my budget with the changes you've been implementing.
Which is not your fault.
You were my mistake, which I take full credit for.
Okay, I thought you were liking the changes I was making.
We just sold another poncho yesterday.
I still can't believe we even sold one.
But that's not gonna help me when I am down to a Costco card and a zoo membership.
Okay.
Well, is there anything I can do?
No, you've done enough already.
Fortunately, I did gotten some good news.
Apparently there is a Blouse Barn in Australia and they are gonna pay me to use their name here.
Can you believe it?
That there's another store called Blouse Barn?
No.
No, it's an entire chain.
They're expanding into North America and they are gonna pay me $10,000 just to cover the costs of renaming the store.
Okay, so they're buying the name from you?
Well, it's more of a gesture actually.
Apparently, I have been using the name without their permission.
Okay, so this company is giving you $10,000 as a gesture And to think I almost called this place "Blouse House".
Something seems really sketchy about this and I'm not just saying that because I have a hard time with Australians.
- Lotta drunks.
- Well, it's already happening.
They're coming in this week, they're bringing the paperwork As your brand manager, I feel like I need to be at that meeting.
I don't know At least let me talk to a few people before you decide.
If there's one thing I've learned from "The Good Wife", it's never accept a first offer.
- I I'm gonna just do that.
- Oh.
- I have a question.
- Yes, your cologne is too strong.
Okay, I just put it on and it needs to breathe a bit, so I came in here to ask whether you knew anything about trademarking store names?
Yeah.
We had to deal with that from time to time at Rose Video.
Uh-huh.
And did anyone ever ask you to stop using the name?
No, but we went after other people for using it.
I remember a-a "Rosie's Video" in Sao Paolo.
That was a fun shakedown.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, well, say you owned Blouse Barn.
Well, first of all, I'd never get into the clothing business 'cause the margins are terrible Okay, let's pretend for a sec.
And someone was offering you $10,000 to stop using the name because there's another Blouse Barn in Australia and they need the name.
$10,000 to stop using the name "Blouse Barn"?
- That's correct.
- I would take that in a second.
It's a terrible name.
- Okay, but that's not - Now at least with "Rose Video," it said what it was, and the logo looked great on a golf shirt.
Yeah, I'm just thinking if it's a big chain and they want the name, surely you should be able to get more for it.
Yeah, but is worth going to court to fight it?
Oh, I don't think Wendy can afford that.
She can't even afford me anymore, so Wait a minute.
You were fired?
Technically, I would say I'm in a transition phase at the moment.
This is terrible news.
I thought you were turning that store around.
All those big purchases, all that spending Okay, let's just focus on the big picture, which is helping the store.
Well, if you wanna help the store, I would tell your boss to take the deal.
And then you and I are gonna sit down, update your resume, and get you back into the workforce.
Okay.
Well, thank you so much for this.
Um, it was entirely unhelpful, but thank you nevertheless.
Well anytime, son.
Moira: Oh, it's just so violating.
How can one sleep knowing our streets are laden with thieves?
Ronnie: Well, I don't know about laden.
I had a newspaper stolen once.
Two days ago, we had someone break our window.
They didn't take anything, but they left a dead bird inside.
That's kind of like my aunt.
She has a ghost in her house that keeps leaving dimes everywhere.
Look what's happened to us.
These sign bandits have clearly created a culture of fear.
If it helps at all, I'd be happy to put one of your signs on my lawn.
Th-that is if Jocelyn doesn't mind.
Oh no, I'd put one on my lawn if I wasn't worried about winning.
I hope you know that I don't stand for dirty politics, Moira.
Oh no, you mustn't beat yourself up.
You have your own signs to worry about.
All two hundred of them.
Well we're here to sing, aren't we?
So let's sing!
Well said!
Let us focus on tomorrow's show and not fan the flames of this provocative scandal any more than is necessary.
Sing ladies if you can.
-  - Ronnie: Let's do this.
Hey.
What're you shopping for?
I'm not shopping.
Okay, well, I'm seeing a lot of women's tops, so if there's a minimum amount for free shipping can let me know before you order?
Okay, yeah, no, I'm I'm actually doing work, so.
Mm Dad said that you got fired.
I wasn't fired.
I'm actually working so that I can stay employed.
I have a big meeting with some lawyers and I'm trying to make sure they're not taking advantage of Wendy.
Poor thing is a hot mess.
Okay, I just really think you should stay out of it, David.
You're not good under pressure.
- And you are?
- Um, I'm sorry.
Were you picked up by the South Korean Secret Police on New Year's?
I had to sweet talk the consulate's lawyer to get me a passport before midnight.
Okay, well this is a very different situation from that and I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be fine.
Did you or did you not have a subscription to Cosmo Girl when you were 16 years old, David?
No.
Okay, David, if you have to lie about something you should breathe out while you answer 'cause it really just calms you down.
Oh my God!
I'm not being interrogated.
This is a negotiation.
I'm just trying to prepare you, okay?
'Cause they're gonna eat you alive in there.
Okay.
If you know so much about this, why don't you come with me then?
Okay, well, I guess that just depends on what's in Mom's closet.
Why does that matter?
Well, I'm not gonna wear my own clothes into the room, David.
They're not scary enough.
I know that we just met but if Prince Harry trusted me with his life, then I think you can too.
Well, I do feel better having a lawyer in the room.
Oh my God, you're so cute.
Um, I'm not a lawyer, but I'm glad that my fashion pony is working.
Oh, hi.
I'm Wendy Kurtz.
Welcome to the Blouse Barn.
Lisa Chung.
I didn't realize there were gonna be more of us.
We're her representation.
David Rose.
Angelica Bloomfield of Rose, Bloomfield and Glickman.
Well, let's go to my office shall we?
- Stevie: Oh, Mr. Rose!
- Johnny: Oh, hi Stevie.
I found these.
I thought Mrs. Rose might want 'em back.
You found them?
Okay, look, I know we haven't always been ideal motel guests, but taking my wife's signs?
Ah, no, I took out your garbage, and these poked a hole in the bottom and fell out.
So they're still in pretty good shape, I thought she might want them back.
Oh Since she's been so worried about her signs having been mysteriously stolen.
Right, right.
Well, I mean, I can see what must have happened here.
She accidentally, uh, threw them out.
That's one theory.
Or someone stole them and hid them in our garbage to try and sabotage Moira to make it look like she's done something really crazy.
That is definitely some food for thought.
- Yeah.
- Mm.
Well, thank you, Stevie.
Have a nice day.
Thanks.
I will.
This shouldn't take long.
The check.
This should cover the cost of the signs, business cards - About the check.
-  We had some questions about the amount.
Well, you shouldn't.
$10,000 is the amount we agreed upon.
Well, that may be, but some things have changed on our side, and we want to discuss the I think it's fine, David.
From a legal standpoint, there are lots of costs to consider.
- Mm-hmm.
- There are the signs and the business cards I just mentioned those.
Objection sustained.
There is the travel, there are the meals, there is the shipping and the catering Which is very similar to the meals and not necessarily relevant, so 'Kay.
Well, the $10,000 doesn't even cover our legal fees, so - What?
- Don't worry about that.
And if we're gonna announce a new name, there has to be a whole relaunch event, and that involves Event planners and, um, florists.
Okay, I think what my colleague is trying to say, is that our brand is very well established here, um, so we're going to require a higher compensation.
No, it's ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.
Ooh No!
No, no, Gwen, you took the lower third.
Well, could you please then?
I've already locked mine in.
Thanks, doll.
Moira, do you have any idea how Stevie found your campaign signs in our garbage?
I don't think anyone can hear us, John.
You don't have to keep up the act.
- What act?
- That you didn't know I took the signs.
You took your signs?
I didn't know you took the signs.
Why would you take your own signs?
Well, I couldn't very well take Jocelyn's.
That would be stealing and I'm running a clean campaign.
You call this a clean campaign?
Politics 101, John.
When you have limited resources, your best course of action is to create a stir.
It's exciting, it's fun.
It's like that episode of Sunrise Bay when I stole my own baby.
Moira, Sunrise Bay was a soap opera.
Yes, and this is reality.
Frankly, John, I'm surprised at your naivety.
Moira, you're misleading people!
No, I'm building a mystery.
Voters will draw their own conclusions.
I basically accused Roland of stealing your campaign signs.
Well, then hopefully you've learned something - you shouldn't make accusations you can't substantiate.
- Moira - I'm not listening until you calm down.
Okay, well, Blouse Barn Australia is willing to offer you an additional $5,000.
- Oh my God.
- Thank you.
So if you'll just sign here, I think we're good.
I don't think we are.
I have done some research and I happen to know that your company pulled in $100 million last year.
Point being?
Well, the point is, judging by your bag and those shoes, Blouse Barn Australia is paying you quite a bit of money to come here and help us "switch over our signs".
Bottom line, we're standing in your way and I don't think your client will be very happy if you come home without securing the rights to the name, especially considering you're expanding into 78 stores across North America.
And let's be honest, "Blouse House" doesn't have quite the same ring to it.
- Exactly!
- Angelica, please.
This is the number that we are after.
-  - Now, if you'll excuse us, we have another meeting to get to.
We're in our store.
We await your reply.
Moira, I felt bad about what happened to your signs and so I had some of my students make these for you.
Jocelyn!
They're not as nice as the black and white ones you had, but I thought that they might help.
Very considerate.
Though there's something you and I still need to discuss.
The signs.
We both know that, in a heated campaign, one might use whatever resources one has - to gain advantage.
- Yes.
Jocelyn, you have so many signs!
I know.
Roland got carried away and used his mayoral power to get people to put more signs on their lawns.
And I just pretended it wasn't happening.
Roland forced constituents to put up signs through coercion?
That's what we're talking about, right?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah.
I just was helping you explain, so you Because you seem so upset by it all.
I am upset.
I don't like what this campaign is doing to me.
The other day, I called another driver an effing moron.
I didn't say the 'f' word, but I said, 'effing, ' and that is not me!
Jocelyn, I don't think it's exactly unethical to do questionable things in the spirit of competition.
I'm dropping out of the campaign.
- What?
- I'm barely sleeping, I can't get through an episode of "Masterchef Junior" without crying.
We've both worked so hard for this.
I know, and now I am giving it to you.
Congratulations, Moira.
You are the new councilor for the town of Schitt's Creek.
Wendy: David, come on in!
Here, have a seat.
Lisa got back to me.
She dropped off a check.
-  - It's a big check, David.
Oh, thank God!
It's a bit  check!
Oh  Um, you don't mean one of those big lottery checks, right?
- No.
- Okay.
But you pulled it off!
Um, thank you for trusting me.
Well, I wouldn't go that far.
Okay.
Um I guess we should get back to work.
I love your enthusiasm, but I think I'm going to take some time for my family, for me, and close the store.
Oh, okay.
But I appreciate all you've done, and I want you to have this, you and Alexis.
Well, Alexis didn't do that much.
Oh, oh my God.
And I hope this helps get you on your feet.
And do something interesting.
You always do.
I can't accept this.
-  Moira!
- John.
I'm so excited to see the show.
I'm going to be on council.
We'll, that's the spirit.
Positive thinking.
I won!
Jocelyn quit the election.
What?
She couldn't take it anymore.
Well, think what you can do in four years.
Four years?
No, no one said anything about four years.
And-and the thought of working with Roland every day.
I mean, that's I wouldn't even think about that.
Oh, John.
What have I done?
- 'Cuz tonight for the first time - Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah - Just about half past ten - Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah - For the first time in history - Ahhhh - it's gonna be raining men - dada-da-da-da-da-da-da bop!
So $40,000?
!
Oh, that's a lot of money.
Wow!
Even divided amongst the four of us.
Divided?
I'm the one who negotiated all of this.
Um, with my help, David.
I believe I offered advice.
You said Wendy should cave and take the first offer.
What you gave was the opposite of advice.
Okay, stop.
This is good.
This is the first real money we've seen in a year.
'Kay, I think we definitely need to celebrate.
Nothing big, just a little treat Like a trip.
Okay.
I can't believe that I'm the one to say this, but um shouldn't we be s Shouldn't we be s-s-s Should we be Trying to sa save this?
Isn't Shouldn't we be saving Putting this in a bank?
Isn't that what people do?
Well, that's no fun.
No but probably best?
Maybe we could do manicures.
I could a manicure.
The three of us should go.
- Yes!
- Long overdue.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Yay!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Just 'cause I do my own nails doesn't mean, you know, I wouldn't go 'Kay, they're just expensive and you wouldn't really appreciate them.
Oh yay, David!
Yay!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
1   Kids, it happens to be our anniversary today, so it might be a nice idea if you wished your mother a happy anniversary.
Okay, um What would you like us to say?
Well, you could start by saying, "Happy anniversary".
Mmm, okay, but why are we wishing her a happy anniversary?
Isn't that something that you two are supposed to say to each other?
Yeah, it's called being courteous, honey.
You know, the Bloomfield kids used to throw their parents an anniversary party every year.
Mhmm um, if we're truth telling, the Bloomfields were always a little too friendly with one another.
I just don't understand what kind of family skinny dips together.
John, are you ready?
Yes, sweetheart.
Happy anniversary!
Congratulations on your ongoing love for one another.
You did it!
Okay kids, that's enough.
You sound like the incestuous Bloomfields.
Have a blessed day.
Ahem!
Hello there, Roses.
- Hello there, you!
- Yes May we join you?
- Oh, we just ordered to go.
- Yeah, we're not staying, we've got a million things to do.
Oh, well then, I guess you don't want your present then, huh?
You wanna guess what your present is?
- No, I do not.
- Dinner!
We're gifting you a dinner!
At the most exclusive eatery in Elmdale.
- Oh.
- It's very hard to get a table.
But uh, I pulled a few strings.
That sounds too good to what's the catch?
No, there's-there's no catch, just every new council member gets a dinner, so.
Oh, how very civilized.
It is thank you, Roland.
We accept.
Terrific, so we'll pick you up around seven.
- We?
- Yeah, we have a coupon.
Four entrees for the price of three, it expires soon, though.
It should be really fun, you guys.
Yes, it will be fun Well, it would be fun, if today were not our anniversary.
- Yeah - Wow, happy anniversary!
Well, thank you, thank you.
You two are obviously gonna want to spend tonight just the two of you, so - Yes, that was the plan.
- Jocelyn: Yeah.
Oh, well you know, the coupon expires in three weeks, so Okay, all right, let it go.
You have fun, you guys!
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Bye bye, now.
- Bye!
Boy, that was a close call.
What are you doing with that?
With what, this yearbook?
Could you put it back, please?
!
Why would I put it back, when Stevie Budd was voted: "Most likely to get the guy".
With that hair cut?
!
I'll have you know I was very popular with the boys.
And girls, it seems.
Wow, well, according to the Internet, you were "Mister Popular".
I will have you know that that head-shot got me a two-episode arc on a TV series.
What series?
"Dateline".
I played a boy who got abducted from a grocery store.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
And the performance was so riveting, people thought I actually was the "Value-mart victim".
Hmm, bet that got you laid.
It did.
It really did.
You know, I am surprised that you haven't asked me to leave early today.
Are you telepathic or something, because I have been thinking about asking you that question every day this week.
I was just kidding.
Oh no yeah, me too.
No, just with the big soiree at Mutt's tonight, I figured that you would need ample time to get ready.
Mutt's having a soiree?
Well, I'm sure you're invited.
Yeah, no.
Yeah, no, why wouldn't I be?
Um, were you invited?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I guess it's just-just a bit of a pride issue, you know, do I attend the party hosted by the guy that you left me for?
Yeah, no, I'm sure he wouldn't mind.
Yeah, but I really would have to basically throw all my self-respect just right out the window.
-  - Aww, that's so sweet.
So um, what time is the party tonight?
-  - Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Oh darling, what a sweet gesture, and a precursor no doubt, to something more grand planned.
Something more grand?
Ah, knowing your penchant for surprises, I'm guessing you have something else up your sleeve.
- Yes, I do.
- Uh oh!
I do, I Was going to tell you later, but I booked a restaurant in Elmdale, it's supposed to be very fancy!
The one that Roland and Jocelyn just told us about?
Yes!
Yes, but Who knew they were asking us tonight!
- Just the two of us?
- Mhmm.
Sort of a "Lady and the Tramp" meets "9 1/2 Weeks" kind of dinner date?
Could for one second believe that I would not have planned something For our anniversary?
Tonight?
The two of us?
Hi, Rose, party of two.
Yeah, we spoke on the phone this afternoon.
You're lucky we had that cancellation.
Yes, well, lucky for someone.
We had a reservation which I of course made uh, weeks ago.
You always could swing a good table at the last minute, John.
Okay, it'll just be a few minutes.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
Moira?
- Bev?
- Don!
- Moira!
- Bev!
Oh my God, the Roses!
You're alive!
- Moira: Ohhhh!
- Johnny: Oh my gosh!
- Good to see you!
- Wow!
What?
Don?
Don: Oh, I don't believe it!
Moira: Come on, Don!
Bev: Muah!
Muah!
What are you two doing here?
Well, we were dropping MacKenzie off at college, and decided we'd take the scenic route home.
You must they should you must join us!
Join us for dinner!
- Well-oh, yes!
- That would be great!
We are just dying to find out what you've been up to!
We're dying to tell you!
-  - Bev: Okay.
All: Ohhh  I set your world on fire!
Come on, let's go come on, let's go Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, I wouldn't either, but I couldn't find a cocktail shaker, and someone brought room temperature vodka.
N-no, I mean Mutt made those ice cubes from well water, so they smell a little fishy.
Oh.
Yeah, wouldn't want that melting in my drink, thank you very much.
- I'm Jake.
- David.
It's nice to meet you, handsome.
I-I'll-I'm gonna So I'll just Wow!
Look at you.
What's that supposed to mean?
No, I've just never seen you this dressed up before.
I do what I want.
And tonight, I'm wanting to meet someone.
Hmm.
So, I have a certain high school reputation I need to live up to.
Uh huh, yeah, and good luck with that.
Um, speaking of sexual popularity, I'm pretty sure that um that guy at the bar, is into me.
- Who, Jake?
- Yeah.
Jake.
Why, was he one of your high school conquests?
Actually, no.
But I have a pretty stellar radar for being able to tell when guys are into me.
Mhmm um, and having swam in both ponds, I can say that I might be able to navigate those waters a little but better than you.
Uh huh?
Well, we'll see.
Hmm.
So-so there we are at Izzy Tennison's country home Moira: Oh, tell me she doesn't still have that stuffed bison.
Oh, does she have it?
She's moved it to the front hall!
What?
!
Grier wanted to hang her coat on the horns!
And it gets better.
Don here Oh, wait now, don't throw me under the bus, it was Borden who started it all.
Borden Simons?
It's like old home week!
Anyway, I look over, and Don and Borden are on their hands and knees, crawling through the doggie door in the kitchen!
- It was too funny!
-  - Oh, you should've been there.
- Oh, wish we could've been.
- Maybe next time.
- Well, cheers to that!
All: Cheers.
Hey uh Johnny?
Moira?
Oh my God!
Um, what are you guys doing here?
Well, we-we just ran into each other.
Jocelyn: It's their anniversary, Roland, just let them do what they want.
It's your anniversary?
You should've told us!
We don't want to intrude.
Moira: No, you're not intruding, this is a surprise treat.
Oh, okay, well then, are we intruding?
Because before you were saying that you didn't wanna go out tonight, so No, no, we-we uh You can certainly join us, if you don't have your own table.
We do, but that would be great!
- Okay!
- Yes, well then, by all means, yes, let's uh-let's Let's all sit at one table.
- Bev: This is cozy.
Hello.
- Jocelyn: Hi.
Bev: Good evening.
You can stand with a shield at your side never breaking protecting your pride but you can't really win if you've nothing to lose Wow.
Look at you.
Is it weird that I'm here?
It's only weird if you think it's weird.
Yeah.
Okay.
I don't if you don't.
Um, in fact, I don't actually know how late I can stay.
I just wanted to pop in, and say hey.
Well, you're awfully dolled up for a "pop in".
Oh my God, stop, I basically came from work.
Babe, your stove's being testy again, should I just serve the cider cold?
Uh Alexis, this is uh, my girlfriend, Tennessee.
Wow!
Wow.
Woweee.
Alexis, hi.
It's so nice to finally meet you, Mutt's told me so much about you.
The way he describes you, it's like you're this Beautiful little poem.
Well, love "little"!
Look at you!
You're like a poem too.
Like, a really pretty poem, or like, a mermaid, or something.
Mutt, you're growing back your beard.
Yeah, she likes it.
Okay.
Um, okay uh, I'm gonna go grab a drink.
But um, it was so nice to finally meet you, Tallahassee, so - It's ah, Tennessee.
- Yes, Tennessee.
I love that name, it's so unique.
Um, thank God you look the way you do, because that name on the wrong girl would just Ooh!
So You should feel really good about yourself.
She's cute.
You guys haven't ordered yet, have you?
Because I need to present this coupon to the waiter first.
Don't know what that means.
He's so ironic, this one.
Oh!
So where are you living now, Moira?
Tell us all about it.
Moira: Oh, we're in a rustic, ranch style Bungalow that Jocelyn: It's very nice.
Very nice, it's got plenty of parking, and a TV in every room.
Don: Oh, how many bedrooms?
- Ten.
- Ten bedrooms!
Yeah, well, we don't use all the bedrooms.
That must be a nightmare to clean!
Um, Stevie does an adequate job.
- Stevie's one of your staff?
- Mhmm!
Stevie's the only staff.
Jocelyn: This olive tapenade is Salty, I know!
Is it?
I-I thought it was good, but yeah, it's salty.
Bev: Hmm!
Here's a funny story.
Oh, good.
On our way here, we drove through a town Not a word of a lie, called "Schittstown"!
Oh!
No, it was called, "Schittsville"!
Schittsville!
And from the looks of it, the town was living up to its name!
Let's not go for the low-hanging fruit here, Don.
Okay?
No, these are funny jokes.
Please continue, Don.
You see, Roland gets it!
You know, I'm actually having more fun at this party than I thought I would.
How did you do it?
Well, I started by drinking all four of those peach schnapps that you left in my fridge No, I mean you seemed so cool about everything after we broke up.
It was almost annoying.
Cool?
Alexis I couldn't stop crying.
I was scaring all the animals at work.
But when I had to go on our honeymoon without you, the zip line instructor at the Los Passions Couples Resort told me that I just gotta get through it.
Meaning my fear of heights, which I did get through.
But with you, it just It took a little longer.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Staff dance?
Yes!
Mmm!
Hmm, I thought I was shame eating in private.
What is shame eating?
I don't think we have enough time for that tonight.
Are you looking for someone?
No, yeah, I mean, sorry, I'm just, I lost my friend who should be around here somewhere um, watching this so.
Are you here with Stevie?
I am.
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Not here "with".
No, we're not together, I'm very much single, so.
You wanna get some air?
Yeah.
Uh huh.
Mm!
Yeah.
Who do you have to kill around here to get another bottle of this undrinkable wine?
I think it's good.
I ordered the one with the highest alcohol content.
What do you do, Roland?
Bev: Something in agriculture, by the looks of it?
Jocelyn: Roland is actually the mayor of our town.
Bev and Don: Oh!
Not Schittsville, I hope!
What do you even call someone from Schittsville?
A Schitter?
A Schitthead?
- Okay, you know what?
- John, John.
Don't worry, Moira, I won't say anything untoward.
We're just having fun, John.
And I thought we were having fun, Bev, but you know what, we're not.
Oh come on, it's just a joke!
No Don, here's the joke.
The joke is I'm sitting here in a half decent restaurant with my wife and our friends And all you two have done is complain about the food, and pretend that you didn't leave us high and dry after we lost everything.
Oh, we're past all that now.
I'm not quite past it, Moira.
You wrote us off, Don.
Not a phone call, not an email, not a nickel.
Roland and Jocelyn here, could not have been more generous with what little they have.
They found us a place to live, they've offered us their truck whenever we've needed it.
They've invited us to their parties, they even offered to take us out to dinner tonight.
Well, just to be clear, Johnny, we were always gonna split the bill, it's just with the coupon Jocelyn: Rollie, Rollie.
And that town you passed through, it's not called Schittsville.
It's called Schitt's Creek.
And it's where we live.
So Jake, um Do you drink red wine, or white wine?
I don't really drink wine.
I'm more of a beer guy.
Right.
Yeah.
That doesn't help me much.
Um Well, I better get going.
I've gotta get to the shop early tomorrow morning, so.
Oh, you work retail as well?
No, no.
The wood shop.
I make furniture.
Ah.
Yeah.
No, I did a lot of um I did a lot of wood working in high school.
- Oh.
- Yeah, uh, Christie McFadden accidentally nailed her hand to her paper towel holder, so that's-the lesson is just not to nail stuff You know, I'm a pretty open-minded guy.
So why don't you stop by the shop sometime?
Okay.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I knew it!
Uh Where were you?
Where were you?
!
Some townies were trying to get us high, and we didn't want to offend them, because they're doing so well in life.
Didn't want to burn a bridge.
Actually, those boys did burn a bridge last summer.
Luckily they don't get as bored as they used to.
Okay.
Um So Jake is into me.
Is he?
- Yeah!
- What makes you think that?
Because we just necked out behind the barn.
Seriously, what makes you think that?
Because we put our mouths together, out behind the barn.
Just so you know, I kissed him too.
Well, that didn't happen.
Who's to say?
Well, when would you have had time to do that?
Did he invite you to his wood shop?
Sorry, that came out wrong.
Smells like grass in here.
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!
Okay, this is not okay!
