{START OF EPISODE 1}
This job is eating me alive.
I can't breathe anymore.
I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat.
I'm not becoming like them.
I am them.
Hey!
What are you doing, weirdo?
I'm doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco.
Or actually, ten of me are doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco.
What's up?
Get it together, man.
Okay?
So the store was hit about two hours ago.
They took mostly tablets, laptops, and cameras.
Sorry.
I'd like a list of all your employees, whoever had access to the store.
I'd also like to apologize for my partner.
His parents didn't give him enough attention.
Uh, Detective I already solved the case.
We're looking for three white males, one of whom has sleeve tats on both arms.
And how do you know that?
I had an informant on the inside.
He's been here for years.
Watching, learning.
Waiting.
His code name?
Fuzzy Cuddle bear.
He's a nanny cam.
You got lucky.
No, I got here five minutes before you and figured that in this gigantic electronics store, there had to be at least one working camera.
Oh!
Hi, bad guys!
You did it, fuzzy.
You busted 'em.
It's time to come home.
I'm not sure if I can.
I've been undercover so long, I've forgotten who I am.
I have seen terrible things.
I haven't known the touch of a woman in many moons.
All right.
Detective Santiago!
Don't walk away from me!
Yes, I did crack the case.
So, Santiago, would you do the honors?
Ohhh!
I hate this!
Ah, yeah.
I hate this.
And you're just gonna add one.
I'm winning.
It's a good feeling.
It's a good feeling.
Yeah.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
I will!
JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?
Yeah!
Good news for all you murder fans.
Earlier this morning Someone decided to shoot and kill luxury food importer Henry Morgenthau.
Body was found by the cleaning lady, during her interview, I deduced, using expert Detective work, that she had something super gross on her chin.
I think it was flan.
Charles thinks it was flan.
I think it was butterscotch pudding.
Maybe it was just old person gunk.
You know how old people always have that gunk on them.
Oldie gunk.
Could be, yeah.
Anyone else?
How about we focus on the murder and not the old person gunk?
Crime techs are at the scene now.
We're heading back when they're done.
Okay, I want you on this.
It's gonna be priority one for the new C.O. Wait, tell us about the new Captain.
Captain Holt will be here soon.
He'll wanna introduce himself.
Dismissed.
Hey, Gina.
You know any scalpers?
I wanna ask Rosa to go to the Rihanna concert with me, but it's sold out.
Okay, two points to make here.
First, Rihanna You And then Rihanna.
Yeah.
What's your second point?
She's got a type.
Which is really anyone but you.
Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type too.
Look, a Rihanna concert's a pretty big swing, man.
- I don't know.
- She's into watching old movies.
Cool.
Where would I find a place that shows old movies?
Oh, yeah, just go on the Internet and search for the phrase "I want to buy two movie tickets for a girl who doesn't like me".
- Great.
Thank you.
- Good.
Hey, you heard anything about the new Captain?
Uh, no, and I don't care.
I just wish Captain McGintley never left, he was the best.
He was terrible.
You just liked him 'cause he let you do anything you wanted.
On your marks, get set Go.
What the hell's going on around here?
Fire extinguisher roller chair derby?
Okay.
And go!
Yeah!
What's your point?
If I'm ever gonna make Captain, I need a good mentor.
I need my rabbi.
Sorry, dude But this new guy's gonna be another washed-up pencil pusher who's only concerned with Following every rule in the patrol guide.
Meep morp zeep.
Robot Captain Engage.
- Is that what you think?
- He-hey!
New Captain alert.
You must be the new C.O. I'm Detective Jake Peralta.
Great to meet you.
Now don't let me interrupt.
You were describing what kind of person I'm gonna be.
I'd like you to finish.
That's not necessary.
Or I could recap very quickly, sure.
Um, let's see.
I think I said some joke about being a washed-up pencil pusher.
- Now do the robot voice.
- Which The robot voice you were doing when you implied I'm a rule-following robot.
I wanna hear it again.
Meep morp zarp.
Robot.
- That's a terrible robot voice.
- Yep.
The next time I see you, I'd like you to be wearing a necktie.
Oh, actually, the last Captain didn't care if we wore ties.
Well, your new Captain does.
And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders.
Everyone, I'm your new commanding officer, - Captain Ray Holt.
- Speech!
- That was my speech.
- Short and sweet.
- Sergeant Jeffords, a word.
- Yes, sir.
I love that guy.
Same!
He's so suave.
Does anyone get a little bit of a gay vibe?
No?
Okay.
Sergeant, you were in the 1-8 with me Though you were significantly Fatter, sir.
They called me "Terry Titties".
Because I had large, uh Titties, yes.
I remember.
I never liked that nickname.
Though to be fair, it was accurate.
What's this I hear about you being on administrative leave?
A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls.
Cagney and Lacey.
They have adorable chubby cheeks.
Ever since, I kinda got scared of getting hurt.
Lost my edge.
There was an incident in a department store.
Hey, man, you okay?
You look a little jumpy.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Ahhh!
I think he's dead.
And I'm still not right.
Tell me about your Detective squad.
Um Well, Scully, Hitchcock, and Daniels.
They're pretty much worthless, but they make good coffee.
Copy that.
Now the good ones.
Rosa Diaz.
Tough, smart, hard to read, and really scary.
Tell me who has me for secret santa.
No!
That takes all the fun out of it.
It's Scully.
He got you a scarf.
- I'll make him return it.
- Yes, you will.
Charles Boyle.
He's a grinder.
Not the most brilliant Detective, but he works harder than anyone else.
He's not physically gifted.
Oh, man!
My muffin.
Ahh!
Oh, my head!
My muffin, my head!
And I stepped on the On my muffin!
And my head and my muffin.
Amy Santiago.
She's got seven brothers, so she's always trying to prove she's tough.
Careful.
That stuff's pretty hot.
Oh, is it?
Hmm?
She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year.
Ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up.
Tell me about Peralta.
Jacob Peralta is my best Detective.
He likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles.
The only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.
That was very well put.
I've talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally mandated therapy sessions.
Look, you know my history.
You know how important this is to me.
This precinct is doing fine, but I wanna make it the best one in Brooklyn.
And I need your help.
Absolutely, sir.
Where do we start?
What is happening?
We start with him.
Okay, so the perp came in through the window, left the muddy red footprint, and apparently had sex with the dish rack.
Shell casing found here.
Two shots.
Bang, bang.
Great work, Detective.
You get a tie.
Hey, that's mine.
You took it from my desk.
That's right, Charles.
Good solve.
- Tie for you.
- Thanks!
Now everyone be sure to put those on because it's impossible to solve crimes - unless you're wearing a tie.
- Lay off the Captain.
That man is gonna be my rabbi.
Okay, first of all, when you use the word "rabbi," you know that turns me on and that's unfair in the work environment.
Secondly, your rabbi is a pain in my ass.
Yeah, he's a little too serious.
- What do you think, Rosa?
- He seems cool.
Yeah, he seems cool.
I agree.
Looks like the perp stole a computer, a watch, and a Jamon Iberico ham, valued at what!
$6,000.
$6,000 for a ham?
Jamon Iberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain.
They had it at my uncle's funeral.
I gorged myself at that funeral.
I mean, I was constipated for three days.
Wow, that's a great story, Charles, thank you.
All right, listen up, everybody.
Better contact Captain Holt, let him know we got a ten-tie situation.
Speaking of ties, where's yours, meep morp?
This is fantastic.
Captain!
Hey!
Welcome to the murder.
What are you doing here?
I like to know what my detectives are up to.
- That okay by you?
- Yep.
Take Santiago and knock on doors.
See if the neighbors heard anything.
Door duty?
It's a waste of time.
Diaz and Boyle.
Check in the coroner.
Report back to me in an hour.
- That went well.
- No, it didn't.
He's got like super hearing.
Hey, Rosa!
Rosa.
Rosa!
Um, I just happened to notice that there's an old movie festival playing at the film forum this week.
Wanna go?
Sure.
Cool!
Awesome.
There's a bunch of movie options.
I'll probably just go with something classic like Citizen Kane.
Citizen Kane is terrible.
Pick a good movie.
Good call.
Smart.
I'll do it.
I'll pick a better movie than Citizen Kane.
So Gina Civilian administrators like yourself often have their ear to the ground.
What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?
I will tell you on six conditions.
Number one, you let me use your office to practice my dance moves.
Second How about this?
- If you tell me - Mm-hmm.
I won't have you suspended Without pay.
Oh, that sounds great.
Okay, the deal is if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car.
It's an old Mustang, and it's pretty sweet.
If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him.
He guarantees it will end in sex.
I bet on at least some over-the-clothes action.
At the very least, some touching - No, that's enough, Gina.
- Caresses.
I could see him showing up in a silk robe.
- That's enough, Gina.
- All right.
Thank you.
Let the wasting of time begin.
Hello, sir.
Can we ask you a few questions?
Definitely.
Yeah.
I'm actually I'm super glad you guys are here right now.
Are you smelling that weed smell?
Yeah.
'Cause a dude broke in, smoked weed, and bolted.
It's Do you think it's the same dude that left that bong there on the floor?
Yes.
Police!
- Hello.
- Hello.
What's your name?
- My name?
- Mm-hmm.
- Mlepnos.
- Can you spell that, please?
M-l-e-p Clay.
Did you say "Clay"?
Yes, the "Clay" is silent.
All right, got it.
Have you seen this man before?
He was shot last night.
Oh.
Thank you.
No, sir, that's ours.
We need that.
- We - And he kept it.
Wall Street journal on the doormat Top floor apartment.
like a hot, eligible bachelor.
I'll take that action.
Police!
Open up!
Hello.
Oh!
Hello, sir!
How are you today?
I am Detective Right-All-The-Time, and this is my partner Detective Terrible Detective.
No surprises from the coroner.
A few gunshots, shoulder and chest.
None of the neighbors heard or saw anything.
And what's worse, Santiago struck out with a 92-year-old.
That is not accurate, sir.
Wait, you hooked up with him?
Ugh!
All right, hit the pawn shops and canvass the neighborhood.
And while you're out, you can buy yourself a tie.
Oh, actually, sir I'm wearing a tie right now.
Check it out.
Secret tie.
First of all, I think you're kind of overdoing it with the manscaping.
But more importantly, Detective, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously?
Does anyone here know why it's so important to me that you all dress appropriately?
Hmm.
Four highly trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery.
I wanna be briefed on any new developments.
Any questions?
I was gonna ask you if you thought I was doing too much manscaping, but we solved that one.
So I'm good.
Hey, Boyle.
- Yep.
- What about this fancy ham stuff?
- Jamon Iberico.
- Yes.
The perp left a really expensive TV but then stole ham?
It doesn't make sense.
Is there a place nearby the crime scene that sells it?
- Beneficio's might.
- Let's go.
You gotta brief the C.O. first.
We'll brief him after we catch the guy.
My name is Ratko.
I don't know anything.
Oh, okay.
You recognize this guy?
- Henry Morgenthau?
- No.
Maybe actually look at the picture.
I don't know him.
I don't know what happened.
No more questions.
Well, why don't I run a scenario past you, Ratko, and you tell me what you think?
You do know Morgenthau.
He came in here and tried to sell you some hams.
You knew they were worth a lotta money, so you tried to steal them from him when he wasn't home.
Only he was home, so you shot him.
Does that sound familiar?
Uh, maybe some role play will jog your memory?
- Great idea.
- Okay, yeah.
Okay.
- So I'm I'm Ratko.
- No, no, I'm Ratko.
Come on.
I'm always the victim.
Look, I'm doing this with you right here.
Fine, fine.
Oh!
I'm Henry Morgenthau, owner of delicious and expensive hams.
Don't I know you from the grocery store?
Kill!
And scene.
NYPD!
Everyone down!
Ma'am, if you could just get down, or ignore me and continue shopping.
- Boyle, get the door!
- On it!
Ratko!
Oh!
Ow!
Ha ha ha!
Ow, Ratko, ow!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Ratko!
I'm getting mad!
That's a waste of manchego!
Charles!
- How are you still here?
- Jake!
Little help!
Ratko!
He's not going anywhere, Jake!
Ratko!
I got him!
I got him!
Don't worry!
So no, I did not brief you.
And yes, he did get away.
But some bonus good news I got you hazelnut.
And A little spoon there for you.
Is he seriously assigning me to the records room?
I mean, why do we even have a records room?
Computer's been invented, right?
I didn't dream it?
You're lucky, man.
I wish I could get assigned here full-time.
You could not be farther from the action.
Sergeant, you know me.
I have more arrests than anyone.
Will you please tell the Captain how dumb it is to lock his best Detective in a file cabinet?
- Second best.
- You're wrong about Holt.
That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you will ever know.
In 1981, he caught the disco strangler.
It's over, disco man!
Put down the yo-yo and back away from the girl.
Wow.
The man is the real deal.
You need to listen to him.
Gonna be hard to win our bet when you're on the bench, Peralta.
Although I did start a new category.
"Murderers we let go".
And look at that.
You're winning.
Have fun with your files.
Yeah, you know what, I will have fun with my files.
Have fun with your face!
Slam!
That was a slam.
So what movie did you get us tickets to?
Oh, well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them.
Just to be safe?
What does that mean?
I don't know, I didn't wanna mess up.
Because you're sort of Opinionated.
You think I'm opinionated?
Okay, here's an opinion for you.
You're a bad judge of character and your shirt looks like vomit.
So we can go see North by Northwest.
We're not seeing a movie together.
Good call.
Smart.
Keep it profesh.
- Hey, Captain.
- So you found something?
Hey, I like the tie.
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
Anyway, I think I got something good here.
Turns out the name "Ratko" is made up.
But I was digging through these files One of which I literally found in a spider web And it turns out there were a bunch of references to a serbian thug, street names "the rat" and "the butcher," who's known to hang out at a storage unit near Boerum Park, which has red soil, hence, the muddy red footprint on Morgenthau's counter.
That's fine work, Detective.
Thank you very much, sir.
Testament to what can be achieved when you dress appropriately.
Let's pound it out.
You know what, such fine police work, let's share it with the whole team.
Santiago!
Boyle!
Diaz!
Get in here!
Bring everyone!
And a camera!
That's not necessary.
Oh, they're here!
Of the fine master Detective, Jake Peralta.
Yeah, let's have a hand, everyone.
- Give him a hand.
- Yeah, nice!
Looking good!
Yeah.
Thank you.
No record of Ratko on the ledger.
Must've used cash.
Well, I, for one, am just pumped to be on a stakeout with you, Captain.
You know what my favorite thing about stakeouts is?
Patrol guide says "no dress code".
So I'm just the zip-up hoodie and my two best friends.
Does he always talk this much?
I just tune it out.
It's like a white noise machine.
Okay, first of all, that's racist.
Secondly, Captain, Terry told me you caught the disco strangler.
That's incredible.
I've read that case.
With all due respect, sir, why'd it take you so long to get your first command?
Because I'm gay.
Ah.
Seriously?
I'm surprised you didn't know.
I don't try to hide it.
Did anyone else get a little bit of a gay vibe?
Manscaping.
Damn!
I am not a good Detective.
Here.
I feel bad that you spent all that money on the movie tickets.
Why don't you just go to the movies with me?
Nope.
Okay.
Well, this is awkward.
It's not awkward.
I like your company.
You're sweet.
When did you come out?
About 25 years ago.
The NYPD was not ready for an openly gay Detective.
But then the old guard died out.
Suddenly, they couldn't wait to show off the fact that they had a highly ranking gay officer.
I made Captain.
But they put me in a public affairs unit.
I was a good soldier.
I helped recruitment.
But all I ever really wanted was my own command.
And now I finally got it.
And I'm not gonna screw it up.
Captain, I'm sorry.
I I feel like a jackass.
But on the flip side, there's Ratko.
Humility over.
I'm amazing!
Fantastic.
Looks like we all got door duty.
Ah, yeah.
From before.
Good one.
You look great.
Clear.
Clear.
Okay.
Unbelievable!
Un-believable!
Ah.
Ratko, great to see you.
You can't stop me.
I'm going.
Actually, you're not going anywhere.
'Cause if you take a look to your left, you'll see Detective's Boyle and Diaz.
Right there is Detective Santiago.
And behind you is Captain Holt.
Point is My team has you surrounded.
Oh, my God, I just got the tie thing!
Captain, I just figured it out.
Maybe now's not the best time, Detective.
It's a uniform!
We're a team, and the tie is a part of that team's uniform, right?
You ask Ratko what team?
No, Ratko, shut up.
It's important to you because you were kept off the team for so long.
And now you're the coach, and you want us to all wear that same uniform.
Boom!
Nailed it!
Yes, you did.
Now just arrest Ratko.
All right, Ratko, down.
Drop the weapon.
Hands on your head.
Here we go.
- Hey!
- He's running!
Oh!
Got him!
Hands behind your back!
Hands behind your back!
Stay down.
That's how we do it in the nine-nine, sir.
Catch bad guys and look good doing it.
What's wrong with you?
Never took off the speedo.
Big mistake.
It is inside me.
Great work, team!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Ah, Captain.
You're at my desk.
Just what I wanna see first thing in the morning.
You're three minutes late, Peralta.
Not my fault.
I had a plumbing problem.
Which reminds me, I'm gonna need a new departmentally issued phone.
Oh, come on, really?
I'm a few minutes late, so you're gonna call me out in front of everyone?
Good idea.
Everyone?
Gather round, so I can call out Peralta in front of you.
Okay, fine.
I was three minutes late.
I'm sorry for doing one thing wrong.
- Oh, it's more than one thing.
- Uh-oh.
Let's start with the Kristov murder.
It was an amazing solve.
I got him to confess in 20 minutes.
You also mislabeled the evidence, so that confession is worthless if the sergeant hadn't caught your mistake.
Here are three cases with sloppy paperwork.
Here are two pictures.
One is your locker.
The other is a garbage dump in the Philippines.
Can you tell which is which?
- That one's the dump?
- They're both your locker.
Gah, I should've guessed that.
He's good.
This folder is labeled "undies, dirty".
So I won't confuse it with "undies, clean".
Also, who cares about all these rules?
I have more felony arrests than any other Detective here.
You also have more mice living in your desk than any other Detective.
Algernon.
You guys, Algernon's back.
Get rid of the mouse, and get your act together now.
He's grumpy.
Okay, detectives, let's get started.
Santiago, where are we with the Jay street drug bust?
There are 12 keys of coke unaccounted for, but we just got a warrant to search the dealer's apartment.
Good.
Take Boyle and Diaz.
Dream team.
Peralta, brief us on the vandalism case.
Well, there's no easy way to put this, sarge, but someone has been painting wieners on squad cars.
And apparently, they won't stop until there's a penis drawn on every cop car in Brooklyn.
Oh, that's what he's been drawing.
But what are those little round things at the bottom?
That's the butt.
The butt?
I assume you have a plan to catch this gentleman.
Did you just say "genital-man"?
Because if so, kudos, and yes, I have a plan.
I'm gonna plant a decoy squad car as bait.
Meanwhile, I'll be waiting in an undercover vehicle here.
He's already tagged three U/C vehicles.
He can clearly spot 'em.
You should take my minivan.
- A minivan?
- A-ha!
You all got a problem with my minivan?
'Cause my wife doesn't like it either.
She wanted an SUV, but those things roll, man.
They roll!
That's a good idea, sergeant.
We'll take the van.
We?
You're coming with me?
Sir, with all due respect, I don't need backup.
It's not backup.
It's babysitting.
- Babysitting.
- A-ha!
Oh, look at this.
The drug dealer got a B.A. in art history from Brooklyn college.
Interesting, huh?
How's that interesting?
Well, it's surprising because you would think he had studied drugs.
I studied art history too.
- Also not interesting.
- Excuse me.
I know I'm just a lowly civilian administrator, but I couldn't help overhearing you're looking for some missing drugs?
As it turns out, my friend here, Carlene, is a psychic, and she's ready to help you.
I do palms, tarot, and I have a degree in numerology from the Internet.
- Ugh.
- Really, Gina?
- A psychic?
- What?
She's the real deal.
E.G., last week, she predicted I would have a sensuous encounter with a guy named Mark.
And I did.
Is anyone here named Mark?
You're good.
Okay, she's had visions which, frankly, science cannot account for.
Also, she can get you amazing deals on ladies' footwear.
She's assistant manager at Leonard's designer shoes.
Vision.
The drugs are in a location.
I see the color blue She sees blue.
And yellow.
And I see the letter "L", "R", "S", "T", "W", "E", and "B".
So basically, everyone's first eight guesses in hangman?
Thank you, Carlene.
Your entire life is garbage.
So Holt's coming on my stakeout now?
I made a mixtape with some very explicit rap on it, and now I can't sing along.
You made a mixtape?
Yes, I still listen to cassettes.
This guy is all over me.
I mean, a Captain on a minor vandalism case?
It's insane.
What's insane is how you refuse to get with the program.
There is a new sheriff in town, Jake.
Well, I like the old sheriff.
I mean, McGintley wouldn't care about a messy desk or all these stupid rules.
Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase Hey!
What the hell's going on here?
Science experiment.
I wanna see what happens if I taser this cantaloupe.
Okay.
Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase Ah!
Yeah!
And McGintley wouldn't care if I was three minutes late 'cause he was always an hour late and hungover, and he would let you do literally anything you want if you gave him a hamburger.
Did he let you play your mixtape?
Okay.
That's very funny.
Get an iPod, man.
Mixtape.
I just want to apologize for my fellow Detective's behavior.
Okay, my granny also had the gift.
I feel that I will die soon.
She was right.
She died two years later.
Your sincere belief in my gift means a great deal.
Vision.
The woman you love, the one you work with, the scary one with the black hair - Rosa.
- Yes?
She doesn't love you back.
She will never love you back.
Say "thank you," Charles.
She just told you your future.
Thank you.
You left without me.
You were late again.
Well, I had to put on my undercover minivan disguise.
Say hello to Harvey Norgenbloom, CPA, recently divorced father of two with a dark sexual secret.
- What's your cover?
- Angry Captain.
Okay, so you do not like my ensemble.
I'm just concerned that you may find it hard to pursue a criminal on foot while wearing man sandals.
But the sandals define Harvey.
He's a sandals guy.
Captain, why the babysitting?
Why are you micromanaging me?
You think I wanna be sitting here with you instead of running my precinct?
Yes.
It was a rhetorical question.
I've spent the last 12 years fighting for my first command, and I'm not gonna let you screw it up because you refuse to take your job seriously.
Hey, I do take my job seriously.
I put away bad guys.
That's what matters.
Well, so does doing your paperwork, showing up on time, wearing proper footwear.
That's on Harvey.
That's not me.
Well, so here's the deal.
You're gonna have a superior officer babysitting you on every one of your cases.
And when you show me that you can do your job Every part of your job Perfectly, then I'll back off.
Okay.
Counteroffer.
I give you 50 bucks, and you let me do whatever I want.
Fine.
We'll do it your way.
From this point on, I'll do every part of the job perfectly, perfecter than perfectly.
It's "more perfectly".
You said that imperfectly.
I was testing you.
You did perfectly.
Quick update on the tagger situation He is currently spray-painting our van right now.
Police, freeze!
Ow, ow, ow.
Sandal down.
Lost a sandal.
NYPD, freeze!
I'm here.
You're busted.
Already got him.
We got him.
Oh, hey, Captain.
Hi, so I was able to procure that $50 after all, and my offer still stands.
Let me do whatever I want, and the $40 That's how much I actually have is yours.
No?
Fair enough.
I only had 30 anyway.
Well, I guess in order to get you to stop micromanaging me, I'm gonna have to get back to the most important piece of police work there is: Writing a perfect report.
Good, I'm anxious to read it.
And I'm anxious to restore my status as a lone wolf.
Anything else, Detective?
Yeah, I'm gonna do one more.
Lone wolf.
He's digging me.
Hey, sarge, do you know where we keep the glitter?
Just wanna make sure this report for the Captain is extra sparkly.
What are you doing, Peralta?
Look, if I have to do things his way, I'm gonna do them my way.
Okay, man.
It was nice working with you.
I'm not scared of him, okay?
I'm not scared of anyone.
Oh, also, the tagger drew a penis on your minivan.
I'm sorry.
Please don't chase after me.
What?
There's a penis on my minivan?
High ceilings, three bedrooms.
Why does every perp have a nicer place than I do?
You know what they don't teach you at the academy?
It's better to be a criminal.
Oh, no.
The cabinets are blue.
Tacky.
Not a deal breaker, though.
I'd just repaint it.
The psychic predicted the drugs would be found in something blue.
I see the color blue.
She also made this really depressing prediction about my life.
She will never love you back.
And if she's right about where we find the drugs, that means she's right about the other thing.
- Uh-huh.
- Kitchen.
- Whoa.
- Jackpot.
There's way more than 12 keys in here.
Where was it?
Baseboard, behind the hamper.
What color was the hamper?
- Green.
- Yes.
The clothes hamper was green.
The clothes hamper was green!
Drinks on me.
You're weird.
Sorry this is taking so long.
Still writing up my report.
Pretty detailed.
Hey, Gina, can you look up what the humidity was about an hour ago and also what moon cycle we're in?
No, sorry.
Don't feel like it, no.
Thanks, Gina.
And now to you.
What's your name?
My name is banana fartman, md.
I don't believe you.
Come on, man.
Just tell me who you are.
I need to fill this thing out perfectly, so my boss will get off my back.
Are you a minor?
How old are you?
I'm 610.
I'm a highlander.
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna put that in there.
And then you're gonna be tried as an adult highlander.
And they're gonna cut your head off.
Is that what you want?
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your psychic friend's predictions about the drug case were wrong, which means all of her predictions are wrong.
Mm-mm.
No way.
She's never wrong.
We found the cocaine behind a green hamper.
Never said green or the letter "H".
Mm-hmm, she said "blue" and "yellow," Charles.
I don't know if there's any kindergarteners present, but those two colors combined make green.
She also mentioned the letters "L" and "B," and another name for a hamper is Lady bin?
Laundry basket.
Oh, little boo-boo.
Can you go be depressed over there?
You're bumming out my whole area.
Baby, I've got some bad news.
Someone painted a giant penis on our minivan.
No, you cannot have an SUV now.
Those things roll, baby.
They roll!
Hey, look at this.
Your prints were on file.
Nice to meet you, Trevor Podolski.
Oh, Podolski, just like deputy police commissioner Podolski.
Your father is deputy police commissioner Podolski.
I'm not sure how things work here, but does that mean that your career is in my hands?
Okay, you know what?
Yes.
I feel like we could round up to 21.
Or we could round down to 20, take the extra 0.2, sell it to our friends.
I'll call the D.A. Rosa, you log this in.
Charles, maybe watch Gina.
So what are you doing tonight?
Nothing.
What about you Are doing tonight?
Nothing.
Carlene.
Whelp, I hope you find something to do.
I'm gonna pee.
That's what I'm doing tonight.
No.
Deputy commissioner's son, huh?
His decision to target cop cars makes a lot more sense now.
We gotta let him walk, right?
He defaced nine police vehicles, and you caught him red-handed.
Why would you let him walk?
Captain, I did all the work on this perfectly.
I mean, my report has over 25 pages of meticulous research, diagrams, and maps.
I even put an "about the author" section on the back.
I did everything you asked me to do, but this is above my pay grade.
You gotta make the call.
You're the arresting officer.
It's your call.
I told you to do every part of your job, and making this call is part of your job.
- Yeah, but you think I should process him.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, if I do, the deputy commissioner could ruin my career, and I'll end up on the streets selling my beautiful body for a can of beans.
Mm-hmm.
Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like a statue?
Yes.
Man, you were totally right about the cocaine, and you were also right about Rosa.
Who's Rosa?
The woman I The woman who doesn't love him back.
Oh.
Yes, that woman.
You know, it can be a burden to always know what's gonna happen in the future.
Don't get out of the chair.
I just had a vision of you leaving this chair and getting seriously injured.
Oh, my God.
I should probably wheel you back to your desk.
That is a great idea.
Wheel you off a bridge.
I'm kidding.
Oh, you're alone Uh-oh, you're alone for life So here are my options.
One, I process Podolski's kid, he fires me, and I spend the rest of my career as a Detective, third grade, which is literally pathetic.
No offense, Hitchcock.
None taken.
Option two, I let him walk, and I spend the rest of my life with Holt as my babysitter.
Honestly, when I think about spending the rest of my life with a babysitter, she's kind of a cute blonde named Erica, and she always has pizza money and lets me stay up as late as I want.
How old are you in this scenario?
Anyway, the point is Holt cares more about whether I "do my job right" than whether I have a job at all.
So I'm taking suggestions.
I say piss off Holt, so we get to watch your career end right in front of us.
Okay, thank you for that, Santiago.
I'm gonna put you down for "don't arrest," and I'm also going to put your phone number on every urinal in Rikers.
Don't arrest him.
Just smack him.
Hard.
With a phone book on a body part no one can see, you know what I'm saying?
So you're suggesting police brutality?
Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah.
Why?
- Hey, Scully.
- Yeah?
You want this collar?
Paperwork's all done, and it's perfect.
The Podolski kid?
Are you kidding?
I just gave him my lunch.
Okay.
Boyle, what do you think?
I don't know, man.
I'm lost.
The universe is a cruel and vexing puzzle.
I-I'm at the whim of the cosmos.
All right, I'm gonna put you down for "bummer," and you can hang out in that category all by yourself.
Hey, everyone.
Hey, Jake, there is a very sexy, angry official here, deputy commissioner Podolski.
He's asking for you.
Very angry.
Elderly, sexy, furious.
Well, my career is over.
See you at the bottom, Hitchcock.
No offense.
No, none taken.
Deputy commissioner.
Where's my son?
He is at my desk, enjoying a nice glass of bubbly water and some chocolate I was saving for a special occasion.
Hey, Peralta, when you're done, can you help me wrap up this massive cocaine bust I just pulled off?
Thanks.
Oh, deputy commissioner, didn't see you there.
Sorry for interrupting.
Amy Santiago.
Trevor, what'd you do this time?
Nothing.
There you have it.
He said he did nothing.
So I caught him red-handed doing nothing?
I'm saying maybe it's a possibility you made a mistake.
You know, normally, I would agree with you, but I've been pretty detail-oriented the last few hours.
You might not understand this, but Trevor is a special kid.
He makes straight "A"s.
He's going to Duke next year.
Lacrosse scholarship.
Oh.
Sometimes, boys just need to be boys.
You do realize he did thousands of dollars worth of property damage, though, to police vehicles.
Look, I think we can all agree that I'm ordering you to let this slide because nothing happened.
This is officially out of your hands.
Would you actually mind just checking out my report?
It's pretty thorough, and I spent over an hour Kinda snazzy, so Oh, thank you.
I'll get right to it.
Thanks.
Trevor, let's go.
Have a good one.
Choo.
Yes.
What's up with the chair?
Um, Carlene predicted if I get out of this chair, I'd get badly hurt, so I'm not chancing it.
Oh, man.
There's no pudding cups left.
Ah!
What'd you do that for?
There.
Now you're hurt in this chair.
You can get hurt anywhere, Boyle.
And if you do, it won't be because some shoe salesman predicted it.
You make your own destiny.
Well, we don't have to worry about Podolski's son anymore.
The case is officially out of my hands.
No charges filed.
Why is there yogurt on this?
The deputy commissioner threw my report in Terry's trash can, and he'd been eating yogurt earlier.
Terry loves yogurt.
Something wrong?
Kinda, yeah.
I called six precincts about this kid.
He's been brought in a dozen times.
Theft, vandalism, drunken disorderly, but he's never been processed.
His daddy comes in and bails him out every time.
He's a lucky little jerk.
No, I wouldn't say he was lucky.
I feel bad for this kid.
I mean, what kind of father cares so little for his son that he lets him get away with everything?
Well, he's someone else's problem now.
Like you said, it's out of your hands.
All right, I see what you're trying to do, but it's not gonna work.
I'm not going to arrest him.
I'm going to arrest him!
- You want backup?
- Yes.
What is this?
You can't do this.
Get that thing outta here.
Excuse me, sir.
Trevor Podolski, you're under arrest for vandalism and destruction of property.
What dad!
What are you doing?
I told you to back off, Peralta.
First off, the name's Santiago, Detective Amy Santiago.
Second, I'm arresting your son, which, as I say it aloud, seems like an unwise choice, but it's the one I'm making.
Once again, my name is Amy Santiago.
You're being stupid, Peralta.
Don't be stupid.
I can make your life miserable.
Commissioner, please don't talk to my Detective in that Tone.
If you have a complaint, you can take it up with me.
You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, Holt.
I'm gonna be watching you, both of you, like a hawk.
You're gonna have to try a little harder if you wanna scare me.
I've been an openly gay cop since 1987, so you're not the first superior officer to threaten me.
You know how I'm still standing here?
'Cause I do my job, and I do it right.
Damn, son!
Don't say "son".
Sorry.
Deputy commissioner, if you wanna pick Trevor up, he'll be at the nine-nine.
Let's go, fartman.
Carlene was wrong, Gina.
Rosa said it herself I'm in charge of my own destiny.
That means she wants me to make a move.
Mm, but Carlene was also right.
You did get hurt 'cause Rosa punched you.
And the fact that Rosa punched you means she does not like you.
No, no, she punched me to prove Carlene wrong.
Move.
Oh, wait, I take it back.
She definitely is into you.
So much chemistry.
I know, it's crazy.
All right, let's get this meeting started.
I'm not late.
I'm here.
Right on time.
You're out of uniform, Peralta.
Baby steps, Captain.
Baby steps.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
For the last time, the best cop movies, Training day, lethal weapon, and Fargo.
- End of discussion.
- Wrong.
Die hard is the best cop movie of all time.
One cop heroically saving the day while everyone else stands around and watches.
It's the story of my life.
I like Turner & Hooch.
Tom Hanks, reluctant friendship with a dog.
That hits me where I live.
No.
Robocop.
It's got everything I like Gratuitous violence.
Oh, I thought you were listing things.
- I was.
I'm done.
- Okay.
Let's talk bad boys.
That's the perfect cop movie.
Mr. Smith, lookin' fine.
A hot cup of tea Leone.
Come on.
Francois Truffaut's breathless.
What?
Terry likes foreign films.
Mm-kay.
There is a correct answer to this question, though.
So gather around for the greatest cop film of all time.
Please refrain from texting during our presentation.
Excuse me, ma'am.
All right, so there's Hitchcock.
And there's an old hooker.
There it is!
Come on, guys, that happened four years ago.
Shh, this is the best part.
Takes the wallet and here she goes!
Hey, love the sweater.
Who you slayin' tonight, lady killer?
Well, we shall see what we shall see.
No, you're dressed exactly like the lady killer.
Damn it!
This is Jeffrey Dahmer's corduroys all over again.
All right, let's get started.
Scully.
Where are you on digitizing the old case files?
As of yesterday, I'm officially 1% done.
Why are you smiling?
That's nothin'.
There are thousands of cases, and for each one, I have to fill out on 50 different screens.
At least you get to sit on your butt all day.
That's actually the worst part.
My doctor said I have an anal canyon.
Ugh, God, Scully, why are you always telling us about your disgusting body?
I don't see anything.
That's because it's all wart.
How are you married?
Peralta, where are we on the Adams street burglary?
We are very close, Captain.
Aside from a complete absence of evidence, suspects, or leads.
So, in conclusion, not at all close.
And the Vickers street aggravated assault?
Stalled out, and the Calloway robbery also remains unsolved Due to a lack of solving it by me.
Sounds like someone's in a little bit of a slump.
I'm not in a slump.
You're not?
Scoreboard.
I don't slump, people.
I opposite slump.
I p-muls.
That's "slump" backwards, and it's what I do.
I p-muls all over this bitch.
Dismissed.
- Slump.
- P-muls!
Wait before you say anything, I want to guess what happened, based on your face.
Someone died.
No!
You won a prize!
I'm not getting better at this.
I'm concerned that the open cases mound of garbage on your desk has become so much higher than the closed cases - mound of garbage.
- All right, sir.
Let me hit you with a little analogy.
Are you familiar with race cars?
Formula 1 or stock?
That's already way more than I know about it.
The point is, I'm a super-awesome race car who's hit a couple of unlucky speed bumps.
You got speed bumps on a race track?
Is that not part of car racing?
It should be.
All I'm saying is, it's open road again.
I'm about to close a case.
Missing grandma Helen Sterrino.
Last Sunday, her grandson Judd reported she went out for bagels and never came back.
This morning, we picked up an old lady matching her description exactly.
I showed her pictures of Judd, and she said, and I quote, "That's my grandson".
What did I say about doing voices?
I'm a storyteller, sir.
It's my craft.
Anyways, grandson's coming in.
They reunite, and I throw another case on the old "solved it" pile.
Hey, my croissant.
You wanted to see me, Captain?
Yes, the D.A. wanted me to personally thank you for your work on the Jay street drug bust.
That's why we do this, sir.
For praise?
Uh There's a community outreach program that's very important to me.
I was wondering if you'd like to head it up.
Absolutely, sir.
I won't just head it up, I will head and shoulders it up.
I will dive in, swim around it, and just be altogether good with it.
Be more articulate when you speak to the children.
Yes, sir, I will make better mouth.
Hey, sarge, I need someone to fill out a lineup.
Will you be scary Terry?
Oh, I love being scary Terry.
He says what regular Terry's thinking.
This is takin' too long!
I'm gonna miss the farmer's market!
But I'm too busy.
I've got a special case I'm working on.
Uh, Hitchcock, Boyle needs you to fill out a lineup.
Oh, great.
I'll take my shirt off.
No one asked you to take your shirt off.
Stop volunteering to take your shirt off.
I can't hear you!
Shirt's over my ears.
Hi, Rosa.
Ooh, I like your shoes.
They're a really pretty - What do you need?
- Color.
Okay.
You know how, every year, the precinct does that Junior police program seminar?
That thing where we try to get a bunch of loser kids to become student snitches?
No, the thing where we try to get at-risk kids - Losers.
- To sign up to become Junior police officers.
Snitches.
What about it?
Captain specifically asked me to run it this year.
I signed you up to do it with me.
Here's the info.
Now I gotta read something?
Greetings.
Fine.
I guess I can help you with those at-risk kids.
I don't need your help.
It's nothing personal, it's just You're not a cop, so I'm not really sure - you could help.
- Okay.
No hard feelings.
But I hate you.
Not joking.
Bye.
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Terrino.
I'm glad you're here.
May I present to you Oh, my darlings.
Thank God I found you.
Oh, look at those beautiful cheeks.
I have no idea who this lady is.
I've never seen her before in my life.
What?
No, she recognized you.
This is Helen.
Who's Helen?
Oh!
That's my husband.
Solomon!
I'm I'm not really her husband.
You're so much shorter than you used to be.
What did the Japanese do to you?
Different generation.
Okay, this is Ethel Musterberg from the prospect heights senior center.
There was an I.D. card in her back pocket.
Why was your hand in her back pocket?
Well, she told me she didn't have any I.D., and, unlike Boyle, my first instinct was not to caress her butt.
Frisked!
I frisked her butt!
It looks like this case remains unsolved, Peralta.
Oh, my God.
I'm in a slump!
Oh, cool.
You're all here in the break room.
You asked us to come in here.
What?
Here's a hypothetical question.
Let's say I knew someone that, for the first time in their career, was experiencing, like, a minor slump.
What do you think you would suggest to that person if they were going through that?
Well, I haven't really been in a slump since my divorce.
So I'd tell this person, "maybe get divorced".
He'd have to get married first.
Okay, so the suggestion to beat is get married and then divorced.
Rosa?
Fly to Montreal, hit a classy hotel bar, bone a stranger, slump over.
Wow, that sounds amazing.
- Yeah.
- That's a good one.
Sarge, what would you do?
Okay, do you have a backup plan in case my hypothetical person can only do What's going on in here?
We're helping Jake's friend got out of his slump.
Or try working a case until it's solved, Peralta.
I always find that closing cases is the best way to end the slump.
Thank you, Captain!
He's right.
You just need a win.
Pick your easiest, no-brainer case, and work it till it's done.
Fine!
Right after I do Rosa's Montreal sex thing.
That sounds fun.
Yeah.
Okay, this is the Junior police program.
Aka "mission possible".
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to get your life back on track.
Narc!
Hey, Gina.
What are you doing?
Oh, hi, Amy.
Since I have nothing to offer, and since I'm not a cop, I thought I'd just show up and learn.
Do you wanna help me out here?
Nah, I think I'm good.
I know you think getting in trouble is cool.
But let me show you what can happen if you continue down this path.
Hey, yo, I'm an at-risk kid, and I think it's cool to sell drugs.
Hold up why does the kid selling drugs sound like he's black?
He's not.
Well, why not?
Are you saying that black people can't sell drugs?
No, I'm not saying that.
We have a black President.
Why can't black people sell drugs?
I'm so confused.
Black people can sell drugs!
Black people can sell drugs!
Black people can sell drugs!
Black people can sell drugs!
Black people can sell drugs!
Black people can sell drugs!
Don't make me hit you again.
Um I'm building this dollhouse for my girl.
It's her birthday tomorrow.
I told my wife I'd get it done.
I had the same exact one when I was a kid!
Mom, Charles is hogging my doll house!
Grandma bought it for the both of us!
- You want some help, big man?
- No!
I can do this.
It's just driving me a little crazy.
Where do I affix the princess tower, Boyle?
- Where do I affix it?
- On the side of the turret Not now, Boyle.
Let a brother breathe.
Let a brother breathe.
Why would I swap cases with you?
I got multiple calls that a guy in the sackett towers is dealing meth out of his apartment.
It's a guaranteed arrest.
And therefore will have a ton of paperwork, which I know you hate.
I have a murder here with no leads and no evidence.
It's unsolvable, and thus Shall have no paperwork.
You had me at "no paperwork".
That was the very end of the sentence.
All right, Boyle.
Let's hit it.
So where are you going, Peralta?
I am on my way to ending the slump.
I got a dunker, Captain.
Nothin' but net.
Hey, slump, you're about to get nailed by the Jake hammer.
So you haven't solved any of your old cases, and yet you've taken on a new one.
I mean, shouldn't you at least solve this Helen Sterrino missing grandmother case first?
Or I could solve the super easy one, get my mojo back, and move on to catching the zodiac killer.
Am I getting ahead of myself?
No, you are not, Jake rabbit.
I like Jake hammer better.
Let's go.
Ah.
I did not think getting these kids to sign up would be this hard.
These kids don't wanna listen to you.
You're like Smart and articulate.
So are you!
Why am I offended by that?
They don't identify with you because you're not from the streets.
I am.
Follow, watch, learn.
All right, listen up.
I know you think you're badasses.
But deep down, you're scared.
How do I know?
Because I've been that same scared kid.
And if you don't get your crap together, I'm gonna end up busting you and throwing you in jail.
Got it?
Remix, yo!
Throwing you in jail Throwing you in jail Got it?
Throwing you in jail What's happening?
I think they're laughing at you.
That's never happened before.
I don't like it.
got it?
Freeze!
NYPD, hands where I can see them.
Don't shoot!
I was just practicing my minuets, but I'll hold it down.
All right, flute man, who else is in this apartment?
Where's the dealer?
I live here alone with my birds.
What, you don't think I know this M.O.?
These are mules.
They're drug mules.
They're bird mule drugs.
Drug bird mules.
Apartment's clear.
We got multiple calls about a dealer here.
I bet it's the silly kids down the hall.
They love prank calling me.
The only drugs in this apartment are for my heart, my liver, my kidney, my salivary glands, and my penis and my feet.
Oh, bird pooped on your shoulder.
No, wait Pooped on your head, then dripped onto your shoulder.
I'm telling you, it's good luck.
No, it isn't, okay?
That's just something people say when a bird poops on you to make you feel better because it's terrible.
Fore, comin' in!
Oh, come on.
I was at the crime scene.
This guy comes up out of nowhere, confesses.
Well, he says he's gotta make things right, so helps me track down his accomplices.
That is so great, man.
Looks like everything's comin' up Hitchcock.
Hey, Jake.
You busy?
Yes, I very clearly am busy.
The medical examiner's office just called.
They mishandled some evidence.
So the D.A.'s gonna have to dismiss your last two busts.
Great.
And the slump gets worse.
I don't think it's a slump.
Honestly, you are straight-up cursed.
Good to know.
Can you hand me a paper towel, please, Gina?
There's no more left.
Yeah, that sounds right.
Hey.
You're dripping on my carpet.
Oh, don't worry, sir.
It's just urinal water.
Clean urinal water.
You could eat off his shirt.
Why would I ever eat off his shirt?
Look, sir, I don't know what's going on, but I think I'm cursed.
Cursed, huh?
The freakiest things have been happening to me.
I mean, I can't solve a case to save my life.
Birds are unloading on me left and right.
And, two seconds ago Hey, sarge, do we have any old t-shirts in here?
I Cursed.
Yeah, I've seen this kind of thing before.
It happened to a friend of mine back in the 1-8.
Detective Smith.
We called him smitty.
He thought he was cursed, and because cops are superstitious, the whole precinct thought he was cursed.
But then he found a case, and he solved it, and now he's married to Kate Upton.
No.
No one would go out on calls with him.
He responded to a riot at a gym without backup, and got beaten up by a girls' volleyball team.
It was actually quite violent.
Man Girls are so scary.
I don't want you out in the field again, Peralta.
I'm pulling you from casework.
You can digitize old files with Scully.
You're benching me?
No, no, no, look I've got a plan.
Give all my open cases to Hitchcock, who's suddenly on a roll, and assign me Eventually, my luck will turn.
No, I don't think that's what's best for you or the squad.
Not until this blows over.
And how long will that be?
Could be a week, could be a month.
Could be a year.
Could be a decade.
Sorry, we're just saying bigger and bigger numbers.
I don't know how to connect with these kids.
They're mean and shallow and respect nothing.
I mean, what kind of person would they even listen to?
Hitchcock, stop bringing your food in little Tupperware containers.
It hurts my fingers when I'm trying to open it.
Sorry!
Hey, Gina.
That's a super cute What do you want?
Sweater.
Okay.
Rosa and I think it would be great if you talked to the kids.
Mm, I thought only cops could help.
In this case, not being a cop might actually be better.
Mm, that's true.
In all cases, cops are the worst.
"Enter the numbers from this report "into the corresponding boxes on the screen.
Then fill out these fields".
And I'm in a coma.
Hey, Hitchcock.
Help me out, man.
I'm so bored.
Let me jump back on that murder with you.
No.
I got it.
Come on, man, let me just No, don't touch it!
You're contagious.
Everything could fall apart!
Geraldo, leave Hitchcock alone!
Come here.
I got in touch with smitty.
He says that you should rub this rabbit's foot with your left forefinger and your pinky, like this, for good luck.
Okay?
Now you try it.
Okay.
Yep.
It's definitely helping.
I can feel it.
The curse is lifting off of me.
Ah, hand cramp!
Rub, rub, rub.
You okay?
The fairy princess castle has defeated me.
I'm a grown man with man hands and a man brain.
I should be able to put together a dollhouse in less than four hours.
Why does it have to be so hard?
Look this screw has three pointy sides.
And nowhere to screw it in!
And there's wheels.
What kind of castle has wheels?
All right Yes.
Wait a minute.
Hey, just heading to the can.
Take the rabbit's foot.
Roger that.
Hey.
What's going on?
Hey.
Well, I'm not allowed to leave my desk, so we have to meet in here.
So what you're saying is that this is kind of a No, for the last time, Charles, we don't need a clubhouse.
Clubhouse!
Clubhouse.
You know what I'm thinking No clubhouse.
I need you to make these calls for me.
Don't let Holt see you.
But if my hunch is right, the slump is over.
Come through for me, Boyle.
You know I will.
All right.
I'm just saying, put a couple leather chairs in here.
Go!
Children, your problem is not that you're troubled or at-risk or bad dressers.
Is that a trucker hat?
Still?
Come on.
Your problem Is that you don't have passion for anything.
My life turned around when I found my passion.
And today, well, I hope to inspire you with it.
Mm-mm-hmm-hmm 'Cause you are beautiful No matter what they say Words can't bring you down No, no, no 'Cause you are beautiful In every single way What are we thinking?
Yes, in the denim.
I think I speak for everyone when I say your weird dancing was just weird.
Fine.
Cops make $52,000 a year.
You never have to stop at a red light.
And you get to carry a gun.
Who wants in?
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
Yes.
Oh, my God.
You got eight kids to sign up.
How did you know that would work?
That's what made me sign up when I was a kid.
You did this program?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
It does not work.
They're here.
Fantastic.
Too dramatic?
No.
Hi.
Why are we in the bathroom?
I thought you might ask that, and I will answer in due time.
But first, I know what happened to your grandma.
Nothing.
What are you talking about?
The reason I couldn't find her is because she never existed.
I had Detective Boyle make some calls, and it turns out you've done this before.
Five missing persons reports in five different states.
Recognize this?
What are you accusing us of?
Probably insurance fraud.
Definitely filing a false report and obstruction of justice.
Now, you were wondering why we did this in the bathroom.
It's because you're full of crap.
Blammo!
Jake hammer strikes again.
Jake hammer strikes again.
Detectives.
I see we got eight recruits for the Junior police program.
Outstanding.
Thank you, sir.
But, as important as your praise is to me, it should actually go to Gina.
She's the one that got through to the kids.
Yes, I am amazing.
And I only ask for one thing in repayment.
A 600% raise.
Or I can give you a zero percent raise and make you my personal assistant, which is what I'm doing.
I think you have hidden talents, which will make you surprisingly good the job.
No, I have no talents.
You start Monday.
Ugh.
Constantly getting Holt's approval is the worst.
Yes.
I can only imagine.
Well, the curse is over.
The slump is done.
Jake is back.
Permission to take a selfie of the two of us, sir?
Permission denied.
Too late.
Ah, that was a good one.
So, the rabbit's foot worked, huh?
Ah, maybe.
All I know is my mind was so numb from doing all that boring data entry that my brain kind of rebooted, and I had an inspiration about one of my old cases.
And I now see that that was your plan all along.
And that you're capable of smiling.
All talented detectives have their ups and downs, Peralta.
So you think I'm talented.
You said it.
No takebacks.
You know why Boyle doesn't slump?
Because his whole life is a slump?
Because he doesn't let adversity get him down.
He keeps grinding.
If I'd given you those new cases, the second you hit a snag, you would have spiraled again.
You need to stay out of your own head.
Okay.
But, sir, I don't get it.
If that was your plan, why bother with smitty and the rabbit's foot?
Well, there's a very good reason for that.
I was, uh, I believe the term is, uh Messing with you.
Oh I see what's going on here.
We're becoming homies.
Office Christmas card candidate, right here!
Me and Holt are homies!
Hey, sarge.
I assembled the castle for you.
Here it is.
Oh, my God.
What happened to all the princess flourishes?
Well, they were destroyed, so I turned it into a princess police station.
You know, some jobs take brains, some jobs take muscles, some jobs take dainty little fingers.
Did I ever tell you I had to wear a woman's wedding ring?
Thank you, Boyle.
I appreciate it.
You're a good dad.
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.
Oh, check this out.
Working siren.
I'll fix that!
I'll fix I'll fix that.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
I'm so glad we could finally do this.
I know, Kylie says you're always stuck at the precinct.
Yeah.
Speaking of, this is work.
Sorry.
What's up, Peralta?
Captain called.
He needs everybody back.
There's a lead on the nightingale strangler.
We're looking for a white male, brown hair, small scar on his right cheek.
Okay.
His M.O. is he finds lonely women with no friends, poisons their food, and then guts 'em in his van.
It's pretty gnarly.
Last seen wearing a salmon shirt, grey blazer, and witnesses have said he has trouble fitting lettuce in his mouth.
Okay.
Where are you?
Apparently has the world's smallest penis and doesn't know how to use it Hi, there, I'm Jake Peralta, Amy's boss.
That's not true.
What are you doing here?
I'm here on a date.
Who is now leaving.
Worth it.
Have a great night.
- Your boss seems really nice.
- He's not my boss.
Yes, I am!
And with a record five felonies solved in one week, Peralta pulls ahead.
Did you guys hear that I solved five felonies in a week?
We heard.
Really?
How?
Five felonies in one week!
Light 'em up, Boyle.
That's the sweet taste of triumph.
- You should shower more.
- Yep.
Updates on open cases.
I just got a DOA on Bessimer street.
You're the primary, you're in charge.
Take Diaz and Peralta.
Yes.
My fantasy threesome.
Of cops on a case.
Detectives, our monthly crime statistics are due.
I want all paperwork on your closed cases by tomorrow.
Scully, you can just write "I didn't close any" on a piece of paper.
You got it.
I already got my paperwork in, Captain.
Then I guess this little reminder isn't for you.
Wow, looks like he hates you even more than me.
No, he doesn't.
We have a good relationship.
We're on the same page.
Something to share with the rest of us, Santiago?
No, sir, I wasn't Peralta was the one that was talking.
God, you must have been the worst fourth grader ever.
Joke's on you.
I skipped fourth grade.
Santiago, anything else?
No.
No?
Uh-uh.
Dismissed.
Hey, Boyle.
I know you haven't had Peralta as a secondary in a while.
Be careful.
It can be rough.
Hey, saboteur, that's not true.
I happen to be a very good secondary.
So you were just borrowing those cars?
Ask about his bank account.
Ask about his bank account!
Ask him about his bank Account.
You should ask him about his bank account.
Captain, Santiago broke the glass.
You can't give up control, you're terrible at taking your primary's orders, you just do whatever you want.
I could go on and on and on.
Is something no lover of yours has ever said.
Blammo.
Look, I can be an amazing secondary and I'll prove it.
I know you will, Jake-in-the-box.
Okay, don't ever call me that again.
I'm driving.
We should leave now.
Carry my bag.
But you should pick the music, primary.
Consider yourself part of the furniture There isn't a lot to spare Who cares Whatever we've got we share It's a great picture, sir.
I hate it.
Me too.
So I have an eyewitness in the purse-snatcher case.
Only problem is, the sketch artist is out sick.
How do you want me to proceed?
Figure it out, Santiago.
It's your case.
Yes.
I will do that.
Thank you.
Are you bowing?
No.
This is how I walk.
What do you need, Quasimodo?
I gotta go meet with Boyle and Peralta.
Is there something wrong with the Captain?
It seems like he's in a bad mood.
I don't know.
Who can tell?
You all right, Captain?
Tough weekend?
I went to Barbados with my husband.
We wove hats out of Palm fronds and swam with the stingrays.
I've never been happier.
Guy's impossible to read.
Don't even try.
That is, without question, the funniest story I've ever heard.
Wow.
This guy must have weighed 500 pounds.
I think we have an idea what killed him.
It was not starvation.
What do we got?
Sorry, sorry.
You're the primary, you're in charge.
Frank Patterson.
no children.
Wife found him this morning and called it in.
Any signs of forced entry or a struggle?
No.
You sure about that?
Looks like maybe his belt had a pretty epic struggle with his stomach.
What are you thinking, Boyle?
All ri I'm calling natural causes.
We got heart medicine over here, home defibrillator.
And a frequent customer gift basket from the cardiac wing of Brooklyn Methodist.
This case is open and shut.
Just like his mouth was, constantly.
That was my last fat joke.
Okay?
Diaz, check and see if there's any more meds in the bathroom.
Boyle, see what you can find in the bedroom.
I'll take the kitchen.
Yep, that's exactly what I was gonna say.
It's it's so weird.
He's so good at knowing what I'm gonna tell him to do, he just does it.
It's weird.
Hey, sergeant.
You know how you're really good at doodling?
I know you think you're complimenting me, but calling them doodles is an insult.
You a big fan of Picasso's doodles?
Sorry.
Can you please draw a perp for me?
The sketch artist is out sick and the Captain wants this done right away.
He's in a bad mood.
Is he?
I can never read him.
You look chipper, Captain.
You have a fun weekend?
There was a small fire in my home.
I lost many photo albums of treasured memories.
I'm devastated.
I'm telling you, he and I have a connection and there is something bothering him.
Can you help me out?
Great.
Ma'am, can you please describe the perp to sergeant Jeffords?
Yeah, he had, um, dark, curly hair, and a neck tattoo Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.
Let's start with the eyes.
Were they desperate?
Lonely?
Did they betray heartache?
They were brown.
Do you even want your purse back?
So far you've managed to tell three fat jokes and completely bulldoze Charles.
Is that your idea of being a good secondary?
First off, I've told four.
And second, I'm helping.
I mean, I started cataloguing the contents of the fridge, but it turns out there's not enough paper on earth.
Five fat jokes.
Thanks, Arnie.
See, Arnie thinks I'm doing great.
Arnie, shut up.
Jake, for once, just hang back and let Boyle do his job.
Fine.
Unless I get a direct order from Boyle I will stand here motionless like a wise, old oak tree.
You look like an idiot.
I'm so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Patterson.
Can you talk about what happened after breakfast?
I took the dog for a walk.
When I came back, he was dead.
I'm just in shock.
We were going on a cruise together next week.
He had pre-purchased the unlimited soda package.
I'm sure the soft drink industry mourns his passing.
Motion reactivated.
Hey.
Detective Jake Peralta.
Dr. Rossi.
I'm the new medical examiner.
Don't let me get in your way.
I'm sure you have a lot to do.
Actually, I've been given a direct order to do nothing, so.
What brings you here Okay.
All right.
Sorry.
Sorry.
- You all right?
- What's up?
How's the Patterson case looking?
It looks like natural causes, but I'll know for sure once I get the autopsy results tomorrow.
Jake volunteered to follow up with the M.E. My man is all over it.
I'm really glad you could sneak away from your case.
Well, it's technically not really my case, but on the plus side, I have all the time in the world.
- Oh.
- To you.
And to the ginormous, dead fat man who brought us together.
Hey, Jake.
Have you heard anything from the M.E.?
She hasn't sent the autopsy report.
Oh, that's strange.
Maybe probably a bunch more people died and she got super busy?
That's definitely what happened.
Okay, just let me know when she calls.
You got it.
Hey, can I ask you guys something?
Can you keep a secret?
Do you know anything about my life?
No, I do not.
Good point.
Okay, so you know the new medical examiner?
I kinda had sex with her last night.
What?
Oh, sorry, I forgot who I was talking to.
Sex is something that two adults do with their bodies when they're attracted to each other.
He's right, Santiago.
Do you not know that?
I meant, what were you thinking?
She was supposed to be doing an autopsy for your primary, Charles.
The guy died of natural causes.
What's the big deal?
Anyways, back to last night.
As you would imagine, I'm normally up for pretty much anything in the bedroom, but I can't tell if what happened was weird or sexy.
Wait.
Close your eyes.
Oh, okay.
Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
What are you doing?
I like 'em cold.
Okay Not that weird.
Cold?
Like a dead guy?
You're reading into that.
Am I?
You have a really nice chest.
Thank you.
I'd love to crack it open and get my hands all over your organs.
Okay I wonder how much your appendix weighs.
Oh.
It's inflamed.
All right.
Wait, that's bad, right?
- Yeah, it is.
- Oh, no.
Ew!
Please tell me you ran out of there.
No.
For some reason I kinda started getting into it.
Oh, what do we have here?
A 34-year-old caucasian male who is dead.
Very dead.
Mmm.
Cause of death?
Blunt force trauma.
But what do I find when I probe a little farther?
Bruising around the neck.
And ocean water in the lungs.
Ooh, how long have you been dead, body?
Four days.
Gross.
Bloating.
Odors.
Oh, uh, 24 hours.
Perfect.
Here we go.
Stop, stop, stop!
Weird, weird, weird!
Rosa, what's your call?
Weird or sexy?
Weird.
I knew it.
- But also kinda sexy?
- No.
Weird.
But more importantly, that's what you were doing while Charles was grinding through paperwork?
Told ya.
Worst secondary in the unit.
What do you guys want from me?
You know, I take over a crime scene, I'm a bad secondary.
I blow off work to have sex with a hot coroner, I'm a bad secondary.
I can't win.
What are you guys talking about?
Um, just weird sex stuff that has nothing to do with work.
I once had sex on a futon.
And it was in couch mode.
Hmm.
Sarge, all of these are fine.
How much longer are you gonna work on this?
It's questions like that that made Van Gogh cut off his ear.
You can't put a clock on art.
Ten minutes.
Great.
Let's catch this guy so we can give Holt some good news.
I wanna cheer him up.
Well, how do you even know he's in a bad mood?
I mean, it's impossible to read that guy.
This is the most incompetent, worthless report I have ever read in my life!
Get your act together or, so help me God, you won't live to see retirement!
It's like, "what's that guy thinking"?
You know?
I can read him.
And if anyone can figure out what's bothering him, it's me.
He and I are exactly the same.
Except that I'm younger, Cuban, female, single, and straight.
Captain Holt's not gay.
Captain Holt's gay?
Seriously, man, just retire.
Boyle, where's my paperwork on that DOA?
Still waiting on the autopsy report.
Supposed to come in first thing this morning, - but so far, nothing.
- This is unacceptable.
I'll call the M.E. and find out what happened.
Eh, bup-bup-bup-bup-bah.
That's not necessary, sir.
For the record, I think it's natural causes anyway, but I'm also the secondary in this case.
It's my responsibility, so I will head on down there and pick up the report.
Good.
But don't ever bup-bup-bup-bup me again.
Right, I don't know Bup-bup-bup-bup Bup-bup-bup.
Just go.
Yep, I am going to regret teaching him that one.
Rosa, can I show you something?
What's up?
Patterson's wife told me that they were going on a cruise together next month, but her credit card bill shows only one ticket booked.
Either she's lying or she knew he was gonna die.
Huh, nice find, Boyle.
This could be a murder.
Where's that autopsy?
Jake went down to the M.E. an hour and a half ago.
He still hasn't got back to me.
Jake went to get the autopsy report?
I know.
Isn't he the best?
I mean, he's really coming into his own as a secondary.
I wanna get him something nice.
Does he come across more as a Pinot guy or more of a Shiraz?
You know what?
We better go down there.
See what's holding him up.
Good call.
Detectives.
Hello.
Shirt's buttoned wrong.
Huh.
So it is.
Well, how can I help you?
Uh, we came by to get that autopsy report.
- Hmm.
- Is Detective Peralta here?
I haven't seen him.
Thanks for coming by.
Hold on.
Found him.
Ah, thank goodness you're here.
I am so lost.
Do you know where the vending machines are?
Look, it's not what it seems like.
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
Here's what happened.
I came down here to get the autopsy report and in conclusion, here we are.
Now if you'll excuse me Cut the crap, Peralta.
Look, I'm sorry I slowed down the autopsy results, but everyone knows it's natural causes.
Not anymore.
We think it could be a murder.
Wait, like a murder murder, or, like, his mouth murdered him by making him eat so much food that his heart exploded?
Murder murder.
We need the autopsy to be sure.
I have not gotten to that yet.
You guys have been down here for two hours.
What, did you have sex 40 times?
No, Charles, like Look, I'm sorry.
We didn't know it was a homicide.
Well, it shouldn't matter.
I'm your primary and I asked you to do something.
So if it's okay, I'd like to be upset with you.
It's more than okay.
It's okay times two.
Now, Dr. Rossi, will you please perform the autopsy for us right now?
Actually, with a body this size, I'd need my assistant, and I gave him the rest of the afternoon off when Jake showed up.
Guilty.
Okay, fine.
I will act as your assistant because I am a wonderful secondary.
How gross could it be?
Just gonna need you to hold open this chest cavity for me.
Oh.
Wow.
Okay, I can do that.
It's no big deal.
Just like holding open some slimy elevator doors.
For a family of aliens Oh, my God.
Yep, there are some signs of stress on the heart, but that's not surprising.
Oh, will you look at that stomach lining?
God, that is just a beaut.
Ugh.
All right.
I'm gonna need you to go ahead and take your hand Yep, get it down there.
Get it down there.
Get it on in.
There you go.
Oh, that is so big.
- Caught him?
- Yes, sir.
He was easy to pick up.
He looked just like the sergeant's sketch.
You could be a professional artist, boss.
Like on the boardwalk.
You think I should draw caricatures?
That's garbage art!
I don't draw giant-head people on surfboards!
I'm saying you could.
You're that good.
Captain, the credit really goes to sergeant Jeffords.
Without his refined artistic skills Finish the paperwork by noon.
I want it included in the crime stats.
I gotta say, I always hate how I look in pictures, but that is so flattering.
Also, I'm innocent.
You got the wrong guy.
Shut up.
Sarge, I need you to do one more drawing for me.
What?
It'll cheer the Captain up.
He'll be over the moon.
He may even lean back in his chair a little and nod slightly.
This is a lot of pressure.
If I'm gonna do this, it has to be done right.
Scully, get me my oils.
Paint or massage?
I'll get both.
You know, this is one of the most unhealthy people I've ever seen.
It's like cutting into a big, overstuffed ravioli.
Sure you want me to keep digging?
Unfortunately, yes.
If the primary on this case says it's a murder, we have to treat it like a murder.
Okay.
Here we go.
Oh.
Wanna see something cool?
No.
Here it is.
That's what I'm talking about.
Listen.
Goosh.
Mm-hmm.
You know what that was?
That was the air releasing from the large intestine.
In the biz, we call that "the death bubble".
It's pretty cool.
- Here, you wanna hold it?
- No!
Knock knock.
You can knock with your hands.
Saying it is ridiculous.
Okay.
Well, I know you're having a bad day I think you're having a bad day.
So, to cheer you up I had Terry do this painting to replace the photo you hated.
I threw away the photo because I think it's ostentatious to hang pictures of yourself.
Especially when you haven't earned a place on the wall.
- Oh.
- But you would have me hang a baroque oil painting of myself like I'm a north Korean dictator.
What?
No ornate gold frame?
Why am I not astride my noble steed, clad in armor?
We could add a horse.
You just wasted your time, Terry's time, and now my time on this when you should have been filing a report on the purse-snatcher.
Oh, I did.
It's already in the system.
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.
Good.
Thank you.
Dismissed.
Here are the contents of his stomach.
Oh, that's where they went.
And here's the really cool part.
Get in here, look at the scarring on this liver.
Poison.
Ingested.
Boyle was right.
All right, I'm gonna go tell him.
Yeah, you could.
Or you could stay for a post-mortem.
Nope.
Sorry.
The spell has worn off.
No more weird dead guy sex for me ever again.
It's nothing personal, I just think sex is for the living.
Isn't that right, buddy?
Oh, my God, he has no eyes!
Oh, that is terrifying.
What now, Santiago?
I figured out why you've been so tense.
You're worried about the monthly crime statistics.
That's not your concern.
I just checked the stats myself.
Our arrest numbers haven't improved since you got here.
They're exactly the same as last month.
If this is your strategy to cheer me up, it's backfiring.
Sir, I don't think you realize how good flat numbers are.
I went back 12 years.
A precinct's numbers almost always get worse under new leadership, but ours didn't.
That's a win.
It's just your first month.
Morale is much higher, people are working harder, you're well on your way to earning a place on that wall.
Thank you, Santiago.
You know, we're birds of a feather, you and I. I hate cliches.
Cliches are the worst.
Okay.
We know you killed your husband.
That cruise you planned was for one, plus the autopsy showed clear signs of poison.
And for the record, the inside of his body - was very gross.
- Noted.
My only question is, why'd you do it?
Um, he drove me to it.
He had affair after affair.
He was a real don Juan.
Permission to make a fat joke?
Granted.
Are you sure you didn't mean "don flan"?
Thanks.
Nice.
Mrs. Patterson, you are under arrest for the murder of your husband.
Sarge, that painting is tight.
It's terrible.
The brushwork is sloppy.
There's poor use of negative space.
I'm a fraud.
Not at all.
I'd like to take this home for my husband.
He'll be glad you made me look so happy.
I was trying to make him look serious.
I still can't read him.
- No one can.
- I can.
He likes it.
Nice job, Boyle.
- You nailed it.
- Here.
Of course he did.
He's a great primary.
And I'm sorry I was such a bad number two.
I may, for the first time, have been a bit of a jerk, and I'm sorry.
What a wonderful moment.
I agree, it is a wonderful moment.
What a wonderful moment.
Rosa, do you agree?
It's all right.
It's all right.
- Wonderful moment - Moment Between two guys Oh.
D.A. wants to set bail for Patterson's wife.
They need me to send them all the files.
I'm the secondary.
I'll go back there and do the busy work.
You guys stay here and keep celebrating.
You sure you're not just sneaking off for more weird dead guy sex?
We will never speak of that again.
Never.
Okay, bye.
God.
Crazy day, huh?
I hate small talk.
Let's drink in silence.
Perfect.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Hey, you guys see the dude I brought in today The drug dealer?
I think it's the oldest collar of my entire career.
I once arrested a 96-year-old for flashing.
I was terrified he'd die in my backseat Or flash me.
My oldest collar was 78, but the PCP made her fight like she was 20.
What about two Does that count as a 100-year-old?
- No good.
- No.
You talking oldest bags?
That's not that old.
Yeah, but I was only 20.
a cop then?
No, man, it was before I got into the academy.
Charles isn't talking about his oldest arrest.
Ew!
No yes, I am.
Yeah, oldest arrest God, you had sex with a 68-year-old when you were in your 20s?
You know how it is.
When you have a chance to bed an older woman, you No, that is not an older woman.
That's an old woman!
That's someone's grandma!
She was, actually.
That's how I met her.
Went to college with her grandson Marvin.
Don't don't knock it till you try it.
She had a replacement hip with some serious torque.
It was like having sex with a transformer.
No.
That is no one's fantasy.
Peralta Where are we on the Lincoln place murder?
Well, like I told Captain Holt earlier this week, we are at the one-yard line.
It's a football reference.
Yes, Jake.
I played linebacker at Syracuse.
Really?
In High School, I played center field in the musical damn Yankees.
Yeah, you don't want to brag about that.
Peralta, you want to loop everyone in?
- Ehh - That was not a request.
Fine.
Get ready for some stuff on a screen.
Meet Fred Gorman Prominent citizen, lawyer, corpse.
Now meet his wife, Ann Hoert.
She did not take his last name, but I believe she did take his life.
- Nice.
- Thank you, Charles.
Now, Hoert had means, motives, and opportunity.
I just need to find the murder weapon.
For some reason, the D.A. won't move forward with the arrest until we find the knife she used.
Is that reason that they want to win the case?
Yes.
Well, find it.
The family's close to the mayor, and I'm catching heat from the higher-ups.
I'm gonna ask you again.
Do you need any resources or personnel?
No, sir, I've got it.
Okay.
Dismissed!
Sergeant Jeffords, my office.
Uh-oh.
He probably wants to talk to you about how your shirts aren't tight enough probably.
Okay, how can we help?
What do you need?
I need nothing.
I'm about to solve this case, meet the mayor, and sell my life rights to Channing Tatum so he can play my less attractive brother in the ensuing film.
- Come on, Peralta, - Holt said to use the whole team.
We all want this solved.
I appreciate the offer, but I work best alone Except when it comes to sex.
Actually, sometimes including sex.
Will you just let us help?
Okay, fine.
I will let one of you help me Charles.
Yeah!
And I am choosing Charles because he's the least likely to steal my thunder.
I would never steal his thunder.
I-I'd be afraid to borrow it.
Terry, I'd like you to accompany me to a gun range.
You mean drive you there and wait outside Far away from the guns.
I spent eight years in the public affairs office, so my tactical skills are a little rusty.
I need some pointers.
Sir, I haven't fired a weapon since the incident.
The mannequin incident I'm familiar.
Actually, there was an incident after that.
Another incident?
You got to cool it, man.
I'm gonna get some candy.
Sir, I may not be the man for the job.
You used to be the precinct's champion marksman.
I only want to take pointers from the best.
So I'll keep it low-key.
We'll go after work to a private range.
No cops, no pressure.
Blam!
Blam, blam!
Gun range.
I told Gina she could join us.
I want to get certified.
There has been a ton of crime in my neighborhood, and the cops in my precinct are very bad.
You live in our precinct.
Yeah, I know.
I know we've gone over this before, but I have to ask you again.
Is there anywhere you can think of in that hallway where a knife could be hidden?
Well, since I've already told you, like, three times, no, why don't I just record it?
Then I don't have to say it again.
The hallway, like all other hallways, does not have a secret knife-hiding place.
All right, you want to hear it again?
Idea for a novel A mild-mannered doorman gets bitten on the penis by a radioactive spider and becomes the world's greatest lover.
No, don't stop it.
I want to hear what happens.
This is terrific.
He saves the first lady, if you must know.
Sounds compelling.
Oh, boy.
Well, hello.
I heard you guys were making the rounds again.
All right.
- This one's all you, tiger.
- Come on!
Police!
Hey, ma'am.
Thank God!
Here, hold this.
The lasagna's burning.
Okay.
Get the dog, but don't let it touch the baby!
Oh.
Okay.
Peralta.
Yo, I looked at the photos of your victim on your desk.
Is that Rosa?
Tell her I said hi.
The puncture wounds are similar to a case I had a while back.
They aren't from a knife.
I think it's something spiral, like a corkscrew.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Don't shush me.
I'm helping you.
No, no, I'm holding a baby.
That was actually very helpful, thank you.
Uh-oh.
You better get back here.
Now.
Oh!
Hello, Peralta.
No, no, no!
I don't know why you're so upset, man.
I'm the one who had to come to this backwater stink hole.
What's up, little man?
What's up?
Feeling sexy?
Huh?
Yeah, I feel sexy.
Yeah, you look sexy, man.
You know I do.
Watch out for that door.
Yo, how much you bench, seriously?
Captain, please, please, pretty please do not let him take over my case.
Major crimes is stepping in.
Nothing I can do.
You're off the case.
I can't believe you're just rolling over and giving my murder away to The Vulture.
We call him The Vulture because he swoops in and solves cases that are almost solved and takes the credit for himself.
Yes, Boyle, I put that together from context.
First of all, major crimes has jurisdiction over any and all cases they want to take.
But more importantly, you're the one who insisted on working alone.
I told you for weeks to use the squad, and you refused.
I used them.
I mean, Rosa's the one who figured out the corkscrew.
And Charles caught a dog.
Oh, congratulations, Detective Boyle.
You should've involved him sooner.
Turn over your files to Detective Pembroke.
Sir, call him The Vulture.
Giving him a name makes him human.
Turn over the files.
Fine.
But in protest, I'm walking over there extremely slowly.
Thank you.
God!
This is so boring!
For both of us.
You know, before I solve this case, I'd like to thank you for doing all the super-easy work, you know, the real Nancy Drew-level stuff.
Oh, yeah?
Did Nancy Drew solve a lot of murders?
Yeah, she did Murder on Ice, Recipe for Murder.
Nancy was a wonderful Detective.
I wanted to be her when I grew up.
Thanks, Charles.
That's helpful.
Hey!
Should we take odds on how fast I'll solve this case?
- Nope.
- I mean, what was it with Diaz's last "impossible" extortion case?
What was it, six hours?
That's because it was 98% solved.
The last 2% is the hardest to get.
That's why they leave it in the milk.
What?
Oh!
Wow!
Looking good, Santiago.
You foxy ma.
Go rot in hell.
This is your fault.
Thanks, champ.
Good effort.
I got it from here.
And, hey, you feel free to call me anytime you need me to come down here and help powder that big white ass of yours.
Well, that's the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
I hate The Vulture so much!
Me too.
But he's kind of hot.
What?
You can hate people and still think they're hot.
Case in point, Manuel Noriega.
You know what?
I'm with you on this.
Tonya Harding.
- Yeah, she's thick.
- Right?
- Always classy, Jake.
- Mm-hmm.
Sorry you got vultured.
Happens to the best of us.
On my count.
One, two Three!
I got it from here!
Yeah!
Get up!
Get up!
Turn around!
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say Can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Thanks, guys, I got it from here.
Let's go.
Beat it!
Skim white chocolate macchiato for Charles.
I got it from here.
I used a gift card for that!
God, I just I want to get back at him so bad!
I wish I could throw his cell phone in the toilet or slash his tires I don't know.
Or slash his gorgeous throat.
I cannot figure you out.
Okay, I'm buying everyone drinks as long as we're here thinking of a revenge plan.
Best idea gets 50 bucks.
Throw 'em on out.
What if you called him from a hospital and said his whole family is dead?
Like, they died of cancer.
Charles, that is so dark.
I'm putting it down.
So my stance feels good, - but I'm still not hitting center.
- All right.
Back your left foot up a hair.
Like this?
Mm, mm, mm!
No!
Gina!
We've been over this.
Well, show me!
Like, wrap your thick, muscular arms around me and All right, look, hands here, stand up straight, chin forward.
Hold on, my nose itches.
Gina!
When I lock my shooting arm, the other hand feels unstable.
Now, what stance am I supposed to be doing Weaver or isosceles?
You guys did stances?
Like, I'll be like Yeah, everybody does stances, Gina.
Listen, uh Hey, all right, all right!
Look, hey, both you, just watch.
That's eight!
He did it!
That was only seven.
Why are you counting my shots?
Are you trying to have me recertified?
Yes.
If you make eight of ten shots, I can sign off on you carrying a gun again.
Gina's here as an official witness, and I thought it'd be easier for you in a no-pressure environment.
I can't believe you tricked me!
You're too good a cop to be shackled to a desk.
You only have one hit until you get recertified.
So deep breath, huh?
Take the final shot.
Don't overthink it.
Just relax and breathe.
Bring air into your lungs Like you've done your whole life.
Oh, my God.
Guys!
How do you breathe?
I forgot how to breathe!
Is it two in, one out?
What if we wrap his motorcycle in plastic wrap and melt it with a hair dryer?
Little trick I learned in gift basket making class.
All right.
Here's what we're up to.
Steal his kidney, burn down his house, replace his aloe tissues with regular tissues.
Thank you, Charles.
You're welcome.
Leave a dead cat in his cedar closet.
He would have to own a cedar closet.
He seems like he would.
Sneak into his apartment and burn popcorn in the microwave.
Thank you, Charles.
Uh, Scully asked for mashed potatoes, so I wrote that down.
Well, I hate to say it, but I think, by default, Charles' motorcycle idea is the winner.
Yeah!
Winning by default.
Let's get into it.
Anybody know where The Vulture lives?
On third, right near here.
How do you know that?
Chug 'em, boys.
We're rolling!
Yes!
Take that, Vulture!
- Yeah.
- Nice.
All right, give me your hair dryer.
What?
What are you talking about?
Don't you carry one in your purse?
Have you ever met a human woman?
There's a drugstore four blocks away I'm on it.
Oh, no.
Scully traveling four blocks?
That could take weeks.
Hoo!
Take the shot, sergeant.
I just need a second.
You've had 18 minutes of seconds.
Gina's authentic stolen police badges.
How can I help?
- Hey, it's Peralta.
- Oh, hey, Jake.
Hey, do you carry a hair dryer in your purse?
Of course.
I'm not an animal.
Great.
I need you to bring it to The Vulture's apartment.
There's someone named "The Vulture"?
Tell Rosa.
She'd be into that.
Come on!
Peralta, why are you asking Gina about Detective Pembroke?
Oh, Captain, hello.
Uh, we are preparing him a gift basket of sorts.
Look, I understand that you're upset.
But if you want to keep this from happening again, I suggest that you pull your team together and solve these cases before major crimes can step in.
Am I clear?
Yes, sir.
That is definitely clear.
Thank you, sir.
You should be frowning.
Why is Jake smi Why are you smiling?
Because the Captain just gave us the perfect revenge plan.
We team up and solve this case right now!
That is not what he meant.
Think about it, Amy.
We go back to the scene of the crime, find the murder weapon, and out-vulture The Vulture!
No one gets in trouble if we crack the case.
Okay, screw it.
I'm in.
Yes!
That's right!
All right.
We're angry.
We're getting revenge.
We're a little bit tipsy.
We should not be driving.
We're taking the bus.
I love the bus!
So the waitress heard the couple arguing at dinner.
Apparently he was having an affair, and it was not the first time.
Two years ago, she caught him with a dog walker who was walking his dog, if you know what I mean.
- I do.
- Right?
- Yes, I got it.
- Sex times.
- Mm-hmm.
- Anyways, we know it's the wife.
You're real talkative now that you want our help.
All right, it is possible that I should've brought you guys in sooner.
But I just get so excited, wrapped up in wanting to solve stuff, you know?
I get it.
You want to be the best.
We all do.
You just don't have to be such a butthead about it.
What?
I just can't believe you would call me a butthead.
- Shut up.
- That's so harsh.
Hitchcock farts nonstop.
Still waiting, sergeant.
It's just the target looks exactly like a friend of mine.
It's just freaking me out.
You have a friend - Who's just a silhouette?
- Yes.
Let's all just count to a million.
One, two, three, four, five, six So then Iceman says, "You can be my wingman any day".
And then Maverick says I've seen the film, sergeant.
I haven't.
What happens next?
Goose comes back, right?
He's not really dead.
Goose is gone.
- No!
- I know!
All right, here's how it went down.
wife goes down to the doorman, says a guy murdered her husband and then ran off.
We know she's lying.
We've just got to find the corkscrew to make our case airtight.
I say we role-play, see if something sparks.
Darling, thank you for a lovely dinner.
Perhaps we should have one more drink before bed.
Don't you "darling" me, you philanderer.
No, you're the husband.
The husband had the affair.
I'm always the victim.
I don't want to be the victim.
Okay, Charles is the door.
No.
I'll be the victim.
Don't make me a door again.
Great.
Okay, so Wife goes into the drawer.
Gets the corkscrew.
Stab, stab, stab.
What did she do with the corkscrew?
She dumps it in the hallway trash chute on the way to the doorman.
No, we checked the trash, like, ten times.
We would've seen a bloody corkscrew.
All right, Hitchcock, you're up.
The body.
The corkscrew's still in the body.
No, you're terrible at this.
Go sit down.
You're up, Diaz.
Stab!
Then I Toss the corkscrew out the window, and it lands on a passing car.
Security cam showed no one driving by at that time and nothing on the street.
Okay, I want in.
But I only want to stab you.
Fine.
Charles, door.
Right.
Okay, uh, sweetheart.
Time to die.
That seems a little harsh.
What if it was a magnetic corkscrew?
If the corkscrew was on a magnet It's stuck halfway down the inside of the trash chute.
I figured it out first!
Wow!
What's happening?
You have a ten-pound flashlight in your purse, but not a hair dryer?
I can't see far enough down.
Someone's gonna have to go down in there.
Someone with narrow shoulders.
No!
I have broad shoulders.
I have narrow hips, but broad shoulders.
God!
See anything?
A little lower.
Freeze!
Hands in the air!
Ahh!
We're cops.
Broad shoulders!
Stuck!
Told you Broad shoulders.
Apparently, our Detective squad has gotten drunk, compromised the crime scene, and an officer has gotten stuck in a trash chute.
I need you to lead this squad, Terry.
And I mean really lead it.
I hope you take the shot.
What kind of precinct are you running here?
Would you like to sit down, Detective?
You seem upset.
Hell yeah, I'm upset.
Your team disrupted a crime scene over which they have zero Zero jurisdiction.
They were publicly drunk.
Apparently one of them pressed all the buttons on the elevator.
Only, maybe he just bumped up against the panel with that big white ass of his.
What now?
Holt is gonna kill you.
I don't think he will Because Voila!
You actually found the corkscrew in the trash chute?
Stuck to the side, just like you said.
Boyle, we're pulling you out!
This is the proudest moment of my career.
Ah!
Oh, my God, you guys, we out-vultured The Vulture!
What the hell was that?
What?
It's a vulture.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna take this corkscrew over to the D.A. So we get the collar, not major crimes.
Peralta!
Now.
Okay.
- Before you get mad - Shut it!
Holt was right.
I've been so worried about my own kids, I forgot about my stupid grown-up kids.
That's insulting.
I should've been on you guys more.
And starting now, I will be.
But if you ever do this again, I swear I will crush your head in one hand.
- You don't mean that.
- Try me.
Okay.
Where you going?
The boss is taking heat for something that's not even his fault.
I can't let that happen.
Wait.
Damn it.
Look, it's not your fault either.
And it's not The Vulture's fault.
It's Amy's.
I know.
I know.
It's mine.
It's mine, okay?
God, I do not love how this worked out.
Detective Pembroke.
Now what?
I'd like to cordially invite you to calm down, especially considering that this case has already been solved By you!
Looks like you found the murder weapon.
It's a good thing you realized it was magnetically stuck to the inside of the trash chute.
Congratulations.
Cracked the case all by yourself.
We done here?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're done here.
Hey, keep up the bad work, champ.
Here it comes.
Why does he keep touching my butt?
- Stay foxy.
- Die lonely.
Well, case closed.
Good work, everyone.
Let's, uh, call it a night without any further discussion.
No!
All of you broke into a crime scene under the influence of alcohol, overstepped your jurisdiction, and disobeyed my direct orders.
Everyone involved tonight is gonna get written up.
Okay, fine.
Here's everyone who was there.
Jake Peralta, J. Peralta, Dr. Jacob Peralta, who has a PhD in slow-jam studies from Funktown State University, also involved was the right honorable J okay, enough.
My point is it was a Peralta special, sir.
No one else was there.
Well, Detective, I'm happy to see you're learning how to be part of a team.
Everybody go home.
Sleep it off.
Sir?
Thank you.
Ultimately, it was our raw sexual chemistry that helped him overcome his crippling fear.
You should just stay in the office all day every day and be my bestie.
You could join my dance troupe, Floorgasm.
We're looking for a man of precisely your It's gonna be a long road, but I'm ready to get myself back in the game.
I know you will.
I mean, eventually Not tonight.
I need to go hug my baby girls.
Excuse me.
Jake, I have to say, the way you handled things with The Vulture yesterday was very mature.
Well, sometimes in life, you just have to take the high road.
Oop!
Time's up!
- Can't wait to see it.
- Ah, here we go.
- That's good suction.
- Oh!
Ooh!
Check it out!
- Perfect, right?
- Yeah!
"Dear Vulture, "enjoy my big white ass.
Jake".
Here you are.
Always take the high road, Charles.
Always take the high road.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa!
Settle.
Sorry, sarge.
Ugh, Halloween is the worst.
Everyone's drunk, wearing a mask, and carrying a fake gun.
Plus all the girls think they have to dress sexy.
I know, that is the worst.
Please make them stop.
I passed a slutty tree on the way here.
Who wants to have sex with a tree?
Was it a maple?
Was it a maple?
Buon giorno, buon giorno.
- Pretty cool 'stume, huh?
- 'Stume?
Short for costume.
Ah.
All right, let me guess.
You are dumpy Chuck Norris.
No, I'm Dumpy Ron Weasley.
No.
You guys, stop it.
He put thought into his costume, and he is obviously Miranda from Sex and the City.
Guys, I'm Mario Batali!
"Molto Mario"?
Celebrity chef?
Ginger Prince of little Italy?
Is he also a homeless troll doll?
'Cause you look like a homeless troll doll.
Hey, sweet Batali costume, dude.
Thank you!
There's a man with impeccable taste.
He bit a guy's butt off at a W.N.B.A.
game.
Eric Stoltz from Mask.
I'll take it.
Yeah.
I hope you're all well rested.
It's gonna be a busy night.
The holding cell's completely full.
I keep having to separate Hillary Clinton and Kim Jong-Un.
Stop it!
Stop making out!
Hey no!
What would Bill say?
We need two undercovers at the DeKalb street warehouse party.
Boyle, you're already in costume as, uh, Joy Behar?
I'm Mario Batali.
Okay.
And, uh, Santiago, you go with him.
Yes, sir.
Damn it.
Santiago, I know that you hate Halloween, but stick with me, and I promise you, you will love it.
Can you magically make everyone kind, sober, and fully dressed?
"Kind, sober, and fully dressed".
Good news, everyone, we found the name of Santiago's sex tape.
Well, ring it up, nerds.
I just arrested my first Halloween idiot of the season.
He was trying to rob a bank but had a little trouble with the getaway.
Trying to "split," huh?
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get out on "a peel".
I'm so glad you're stuck.
I've got a million of these.
No, no, don't touch the money!
Ugh!
I swear, these perps are so stupid.
I'd make a better criminal than any of them.
Yeah, you would.
You'd be an evil mastermind, and everyone would call you the handsome bandit.
Thank you, Charles.
And the best part is, none of you could catch me.
I'm fairly certain you would be caught.
No, scratch that.
I'm 100% sure you'd be caught.
Ho, ho, ho!
All right, challenge accepted.
I didn't issue a challenge.
Fine.
I'll issue it for you.
What's the most valuable thing in your office?
My medal of valor.
God, you are such a hero.
All right, how about this?
I will bet you that by midnight tonight, I can steal the medal of valor from your office.
Why would I possibly agree to that?
Because if I lose, I'll work the next five weekends, no overtime.
And I won't tell anyone here about the time I saw you wearing short shorts outside of work.
But if I win You won't.
You have to do all of my paperwork tonight, the busiest and spookiest night of the year.
And you have to publicly state that I'm an amazing Detective-slash-genius.
And this won't interfere with you doing your job?
You mean my job as an amazing Detective-slash-genius?
No, it will not.
I'll do all of my work, guaranteed.
I'm considering it.
I'm interested.
I agree to participate.
All right.
There's the robot I fell in love with.
Hey.
Sister Steve here got mugged.
Some guy dressed as the royal baby punched him and took his wallet.
She keeps laughing at me.
Can't tell you how many nuns I wanted to beat up in catholic school.
Ten.
I didn't know you went to catholic school.
Good.
You shouldn't know it.
I get it.
You're so mysterious and tough.
But you know what I think?
You're actually a big softy.
No, I think she's really mean.
You probably read a Maya Angelou poem at your graduation and cried.
Didn't graduate.
Had to leave.
Why?
What'd you do?
Here's a hint.
I'm not gonna tell you.
Oh, I'm gonna find out anyway.
I'm a Detective.
I will detect!
Hey.
Got an arrest file here for the Captain.
Drunk and disorderly.
So, anyways Gina!
We never talk anymore.
How's the dance troupe?
Did you get a haircut?
What's the Captain's schedule like today?
I'm not gonna help you rob him, Jake.
I'm his assistant, and I take that job incredibly seriously.
You're literally making paper airplanes out of police reports right now.
Well, how am I supposed to get it into that garbage can?
Please, Gina?
Fine, Captain's got a meeting downstairs in ten minutes.
You're the best.
Mwah!
What does your skin taste like?
Dina Lohan.
I'm wearing her face lotion.
That's it.
Thank you.
Okay, party's around the corner.
Tipster said there'll be a huge amount of drug activity.
Why is this costume so stiff?
And what is that smell?
The department never washes them, so it's probably vomit.
Hey!
I got you a chocolate.
Yet another great thing about Halloween chocolate!
Thanks.
Oh, look.
Raggedy Ann is drinking vodka right from the bottle.
People think if they put on a costume, they can just get away with anything they want.
Halloween is Christmas for jerks.
Come on, ma'am.
No open containers.
Oh, and why should I listen to you, bone person?
It's called skeleton.
It's a very common word.
Just put the vodka away.
You guys are cops?
These guys are cops!
Are you in my ceiling, Peralta?
No.
So what's the plan?
You wait for me to leave my office, lower yourself down, take my medal, and win the bet?
Who are you talking to?
There's no one up here.
Peralta, just so you know, right now, I am taking my medal off the wall and placing it in a locked safe whose combination is known only to me.
The safe, in turn, is locked in the cabinet.
The only key to that cabinet is on my person.
I'm off to my meeting.
Good luck with your plan.
You think that scares me?
I laugh in the face of adversity!
Are you still there?
Captain, are you still there?
I can't hear Agh!
Ow.
Here you go.
Don't touch the butter.
What happened?
I thought you guys were supposed to be at the warehouse party.
We got egged.
Some of the shell got in my contacts and my hair and my mouth and my bra.
I can't tell if that's hot or not.
Not hot.
Eggshell in my bra is not hot.
Well, it's kinda hot.
Boobs go in a bra.
Up top.
Whoo!
My man.
Well, it sounds like costume duty is going great.
So great.
We're having the best time.
Right, Amy?
I wish I was dead.
Hmm.
How's the unwinnable bet going?
Well, on the one hand, I fell through the ceiling and onto a pencil, but on the other hand, I also badly bruised my brain.
If you wanted to make a bet with Holt, you shoulda made a bet you could win.
Like who wears more denim jackets.
That was one time.
You guys never forget anything.
You know, frankly, I'm a little surprised you don't think I can win this thing.
You're always telling me how I'm the best.
You're the best, Jake.
Paperwork delivery.
You're the best, Jake.
Jake, you're the best.
Thank you, Charles.
Yeah, maybe it's just Charles.
Look, Jake, I love you like you're one of my daughters.
Really?
But it's not about you or how smart you are.
It's about Captain Holt.
The man's a genius.
He's had your number at every turn.
Well, not this day Turn time.
Sorry, I'm pretty sure I had a concussion back there.
Here I come.
All right.
Ohh, strong.
Ahh.
Okay, here's the first set of royal babies I rounded up.
Popular costume.
Any of these guys look familiar?
Maybe the third guy.
The baby who mugged me was pretty short.
You're not supposed to laugh at me.
Number three, step forward and say, "give me your money, you stupid bag of crap".
Gimme your money, you stupid bag of crap.
No, wrong giant baby.
I still want to know why you got kicked out of catholic school.
Were you doing drugs?
Worse.
Selling drugs?
Worse.
How bad could it have been?
Did you burn down a church?
Number three, step forward and say the word "worse".
Worse.
Excuse me, Gina.
I can't find Peralta anywhere, and you're the only one who can decipher his handwriting.
He arrested that bunny, but I don't know what for.
He's either a crispy mother werewolf or cowboy mustard, oslo, Norway.
Hmm.
The bunny groped multiple women on the subway.
Being able to read Jake's writing is a gift.
A useless, useless gift.
Excuse me one second.
Nice costume, Peralta.
No Peralta here.
Just a normal janitor pushing trash around.
Come out of there.
Captain, hey.
You really thought this was gonna work?
Uh, it did work.
This whole janitor gambit was designed to fail.
It's just like in chess.
Sometimes in order to win, you have to sacrifice your king.
That's exactly how you lose in chess.
Have you ever played the game?
Yeah, I used to play with my uncle Bob all the time, and he said I was great.
This is a game of concentration, Jake.
So focus your mind, and start shooting.
Now you're a master of chess, huh?
He taught me how to shoot backgammon too.
I expected better of you.
You could have at least created a diversion to distract me from your terrible costume.
Uh, I'm not a dumb butt.
I had a diversion planned.
There was just a slight timing issue.
Oh, my God!
Get down, everyone!
There's a big fire!
Captain, you better head over there for, like, going on with that.
Beware of the back draft.
I'll be in your office.
You have beautiful eyes.
Have it your way.
But you're gonna need this.
And that.
It's filthy in there.
Come on, Amy!
Loosen up!
You look like such a cop!
Come on, have some fun, you know?
It'll help you blend in!
Whoo!
Stop trying to get me to love Halloween.
It'll never work.
I'm backing it up.
Oh, God, please don't.
Hey, heads up.
I'll cut 'em off at the exit.
Okay.
Move!
Move, move!
He ditched the drugs.
I'm on it.
Ugh.
Oof, everything is sticking to me.
Ooh.
Ay, h. Yes.
Hey, watch out, man.
Ugh!
What is that?
How is it hot and cold?
So the soonest you can fix the ceiling is Monday?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Wait, stop scratching me.
We're supposed to be a team.
Ahem.
Captain, hi.
I was just photocopying some stuff.
Are you trying to jam pigeons into my air-conditioning vent to flush me out of my office?
Way to ruin the surprise.
How did you get those birds?
By using my big, fat brain.
Get in the bag, you damn bird.
Eat the bread.
Eat the bread!
I gotcha!
I gotcha!
All part of my elaborate plan to defeat you.
So far, you and your big, fat brain are losing badly.
Maybe, if we're talking about who's winning our bet.
But if we're talking about who's holding more birds, I'm winning, four-nothing.
You're only holding two.
Yeah.
Ooh, when you were logging in the drugs, you missed some awesome stuff.
Guy walked by in full astronaut costume, gave me a high five.
He high-fived me too.
Wait Hitchcock?
Darn it.
I wasn't supposed to talk, but I got so excited about that astronaut.
What is happening?
Amy paid me 50 bucks to trade places with her for the rest of the night.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm gonna use that money to buy two suits.
Well, I was gonna ask you to tell the Captain that I brought in royal babies for Diaz, but I'm sure he already knows, since he's always one step ahead of me.
Aww.
Why so down, little clown?
I'm just sick of losing to Holt.
I want that medal.
It's not real gold.
I tried selling it online.
Zero bids.
But here's some advice I gave to the girls in my dance troupe at the "dance till you drop" tournament.
That advice was, dance.
Dance!
Dance.
Yeah, I'm not really sure that applies here, Gina.
It does apply.
It means don't give up.
We would've won if Natasha's water hadn't broken.
Oh, Natasha had her baby?
You know Natasha?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Her dog has lupus.
Yeah.
That's a trip.
Small world.
Yes.
All right, I'm gonna go cry.
I kind of feel bad for him.
Don't.
He brought this on himself.
You can hang up now.
You paid money to get out of working with me?
Charles, I had to.
Tonight has been awful.
Halloween is the worst, and I don't understand why you like it.
No, all the things that you think are bad about Halloween are what make it great.
The big kids egg you.
Then you and your friends run away together.
Friendships are forged in the crucible of Halloween adversity.
That's all I wanted for us.
You can keep the wig.
I don't need it anymore.
I don't really need it either.
Hey, Captain Holt, can you come out here for one sec?
You need something, Peralta?
Yes, I do.
Hit it, royal babies.
What no!
Give me my keys.
Will you stop catching me?
Do you have any idea how much I spent on key chains?
$23.
Wow, that is unbelievably close.
Keys.
Okay, look.
Tonight has been a little humiliating.
Things are not going well, so I'm gonna just throw this out there.
What do you say we call off the bet and pretend this whole thing never happened?
Oh, I'm not letting you off the hook.
What?
No.
Pfft.
I meant to give you an out, so you could save face.
This is getting sad.
Yeah, for you.
So.
I called your school.
And I managed to get a hold of one sister Bernadette.
I remember that old bag.
She was my favorite.
Well, guess what she said.
Apparently, you were a model student and transferred of your own volition.
Fine.
The reason I left catholic school was because I got into the american ballet academy.
I was a classical dancer.
And I was good.
I knew it!
I knew you were a big softy.
You tell anyone, I break your face.
No, you won't.
You're too sensitive.
Captain, sorry to interrupt.
Some officers just arrested Peralta.
What?
They caught him scaling the side of the building with a blowtorch.
Captain.
Welcome to the endgame.
Would you care to shake the hand of the man who defeated you?
Forgot I was wearing handcuffs.
Ohh, that hurt.
Whoo!
Climbing the side of the building with a blowtorch.
What were you thinking?
I was thinking I had better core strength.
I got winded, like, ten feet up.
I knew you wouldn't win the bet, but your performance tonight has made me question not only how good a Detective you are, but, quite frankly, how smart you are.
Well, that's not surprising.
You constantly underestimate me.
No, you've been correctly estimated.
You have five minutes until your deadline, and here you are, handcuffed to a table, in a locked room.
Which is precisely where I planned on being.
Captain, let me tell you a little story.
You remember when I fell through your ceiling?
Yes, that was six hours ago.
It was, I admit, a disastrous failure.
But it gave me the idea for Herman, the friendly janitor you met.
With Herman, I commenced the perfect crime.
I caught you as Herman.
But you didn't catch Rosa.
Come out of there.
It turns out that Rosa is great at picking locks.
Does not surprise me.
No, me neither.
Of course, I had to find a way to get her out of your office without you seeing her.
So I created a diversion.
Not mistimed Perfectly timed so she could escape unseen.
What about the pigeons?
Oh, the gray pigeons?
They were a red herring.
Thank you.
Their only purpose was to draw you into the copy room while two members of my team broke into your locked office.
So now I had a way into your office and an open cabinet.
All that was left was for the royal babies to steal your keys.
Yes, but you didn't need the keys.
The cabinet was already unlocked.
You needed a way into the safe.
And I got it.
You were so concerned with getting your keys back, you didn't even notice the sergeant steal your phone.
That's right, even the sergeant is on my side.
I then had Charles dust your screen cover for prints.
The greasiest smudges revealed the four numbers you use the most The four numbers in your passcode.
Based on your advanced age, I assumed that you use the same passcode for everything Your phone, your email, and, of course, your safe.
That would be a fair assumption.
It was at that point that I bumped into a girl dressed as a sexy robot, and we got our flirt on hard.
'Sup?
'Sup?
Jake Peralta.
And how was flirting part of the plan?
Oh, it wasn't.
It just ruled.
And that brings us to five minutes ago, when Amy came to your office and told you that I had been arrested.
I knew she's the only one you would believe because, frankly, she's usually too lame to take part in these kinds of things.
And as you walked over here, Charles awkwardly stuffed himself through your window and opened your safe.
We had the four numbers of your code, which meant there were 24 possible combinations for Charles to try.
That could take up to four minutes, which is why I really dragged out this explanation.
I mean, really stretched it.
I don't know if you noticed, but there were times where I was like, what am I even talking about?
This isn't Oh.
But now, four minutes is up.
Which means Boyle is either on the other side of that door holding your medal, or I've lost.
Well, Captain, it seems that Jake isn't the only person you underestima Game over, Captain.
Check me.
I think you mean "checkmate".
You really need to learn how to play chess.
How did you get everyone to help you?
I appealed to their sense of teamwork and camraderie with a rousing speech that would put Shakespeare to shame.
For too long, we've been put down, ridiculed, made to wear ties!
But no more!
For today, we defeat him!
And that worked?
No.
No, no.
Not at all.
My speech did not inspire them.
Come on.
So I bribed them.
I told them that if we pulled this off, I would do all of their paperwork.
And since you're doing all my paperwork I'm impressed, Peralta.
Well done.
Thank you, sir.
In fact, the thing that you failed to see, Captain, teamwork, is exactly Captain?
What provided our success.
Sir?
He's not coming back.
Boyle, I need you in the briefing room.
What is all this?
You know how I think Halloween is for jerks?
Well, this Halloween, I was the jerk.
I'm sorry about tonight.
"I'm sorry about tonight".
We found the title for Santiago's follow-up sex tape.
I'm sorry I couldn't convince you to love Halloween.
It's not your fault.
I was terrible.
"It's not your fault I was terrible" is also one of your sex tapes.
Ow.
Halloween is unbearable.
But it was slightly less unbearable with you.
Don't.
Okay.
Anyway.
We're all going to the bar, so get changed, 'cause you can't be the only one there not wearing a 'stume.
'Stume!
Oh, my God.
It caught on.
No.
Ah, Captain Holt.
It is so nice to see you.
Never thought I'd say that.
Hmm.
A poor winner.
I never would've guessed.
Yeah, you would've.
Way to go all out on your costume, by the way.
I believe you have an announcement to make, so the floor is yours.
Attention, everyone.
Jake Peralta is an amazing Detective-slash-genius.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some paperwork to do.
All right.
Officer in the 92nd got the royal baby mugger.
He had 19 wallets in his diaper.
We got a runner!
Waahhh!
Damn!
Oh, I didn't tell you.
I got kicked out of ballet school for beating the crap out of ballerinas.
It's a good thing we gave 'em a heads up.
Team effort, Go 99.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Hey, Cap'n, got a second?
- It's "Captain".
- What did I say?
"Cap'n," like Cap'n Crunch.
All right, but to be fair, Cap'n Crunch was a war hero and the primary male role model in my house, growing up, so Anyways, cap-tain, you know that jewelry store robbery down by grand army Plaza?
- Mm-hmm.
- I know who did it Dustin Whitman.
I put him in Rikers two years ago.
He just got out, and the crime scene matches his M.O. perfectly.
Okay, what do we got?
Well, security cam shows a male suspect, 5'9" Wearing a black ski mask.
He bypassed the McConnell alarm by using the magnetic kill switch.
And he only stole diamonds, nothing over two carats.
Yeah, exactly.
How'd you know?
I'm a Detective.
It's what I do.
I'm just kidding.
I need a lot more information.
But that would've been a great exit line, right?
The crime techs aren't done yet, but I'm 100% sure it's Whitman.
Well, let's see what kind of physical evidence they turn up, and then we can talk arrest.
Actually, hilarious story.
So that is Dustin Whitman.
You already arrested him?
With insufficient evidence?
By law, we have 48 hours to find that evidence, or we have to let him go.
You just started the clock.
What's up with this emergency meeting?
Whoa, Detective Santiago.
Big date tonight.
How do I look?
Well, I think you look Sorry, that was supposed to be a catcall.
I don't know how this works.
Hey, is this why you were getting makeup tips from the prostitute in the holding cell?
I just wanted to know how she got such smoky eyes.
Turns out it was an STD rash.
Detective Peralta has made a collar in the jewelry store heist.
- Way to go, Jakey.
- Ah, that's okay.
No.
He didn't get sufficient evidence to make it stick, so we have the next 48 hours to fix his mistake.
Damn it, Jake.
What evidence did you have when you arrested this guy?
Some pretty ironclad stuff.
Dustin, it's been a while.
Mind if I ask you a few questions?
Well, well, well, if it isn't joke Peralta.
That's it, you're under arrest.
Case closed?
If we don't find something conclusive, it jeopardizes the case and opens the department up to a lawsuit.
So cancel your plans.
We're here until this is over.
- Damn it, Peralta.
- Ow!
I know everyone's mad at Peralta for ruining their weekend.
But?
That was it.
I was just demonstrating for Detective Peralta what a fact is.
Terry, you just pulled two doubles.
You must be tired.
I'll stay for this Whitman debacle.
- You go home.
- I'm not tired.
Why would you think I was tired?
I ended up doing of sleep chin-ups on muscle memory alone.
Tired Terry still gets after it, that's all I'm saying.
Hey, Gina, can you order food for us at the Flatbush Diner?
They make the best pies in New York City.
Oopsie, you said something super dumb.
The best pie in the city's at Crust.
Wrong.
Ignorant and wrong.
Uh, you think you can just bully people, but you can't.
It's not okay.
I'm the bully around here, ask anyone.
Boyle, you're always blogging on that foodie website.
Which pie's better?
Yeah, whose do you like better, mine or Rosa's?
Oh, uh, you know, I-I haven't been to either place yet.
Why is your eye twitching?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Could I see you for a second in the evidence lockup?
Charles, I know what's going on.
You've tried both pies.
You know mine is better.
But you're scared to tell Rosa, 'cause you're into her.
What?
That is not true, okay?
I-I-I don't even like food.
- What?
- Who's Rosa?
Y-you're the scared one.
Planning your strategy?
No, I'm just making funny faces at him.
This mirrored glass is awesome.
It straight-up works.
An effective use of your limited time.
It is, actually.
That's how I got him last time.
Let him stew for a little bit, got in his head, and he confessed.
- You better be right.
- I am.
Hey, make some funny faces while I'm in there.
I wanna see if I can tell.
I didn't do anything, joke.
That's funny.
You said the exact same thing last time.
And how'd that work out for you?
Let's take a look.
Okay.
Here's you at your trial.
You in prison.
Me meeting Regis Philbin.
That was fun.
You still in prison.
Me at Splash Mountain, just pepper these in here.
You in prison, you in prison, you in prison, you get it.
- You got the wrong guy.
- All right.
Not ready to confess?
Fine by me.
I got all the time in the world.
No, you actually have 48 hours.
I know the law.
Nuh-uh.
So looks like we're gonna be here for a while.
Should someone do a coffee run?
You know what?
Coffee's on me.
Oh, but no froofy frappuccinos or anything, I've only got, like, Okay.
Rise and shine, detectives, rise and shine.
Peralta, I want you to bring everyone up to speed.
You slept in your office, and you look exactly the same.
How?
What are you talking about?
My hair is a mess.
Oh, yeah.
Briefing room, five minutes.
How long were we asleep?
Just long enough for me to squeeze in quick workout.
So, like, three hours.
- Morning.
- Ugh.
I can't believe you live nearby and you won't let anyone crash at your place.
You people already know too much about me.
I know exactly three facts about you, and one of them is that you won't let any of us crash at your place.
Is that a nightgown?
That's mine.
It's a t-shirt from my fat phase.
"If at first you don't secede, try try again".
When you're that big, you buy anything that fits.
A lot of fat guy clothes have racist overtones.
Okay, a couple of quick announcements.
First, I met our night janitor Ronald.
If any of you are missing hand sanitizer, he drank it.
Second, our warrants finally went through.
We gotta place Whitman at the scene and prove that he either possessed or sold those diamonds.
I know you're all tired, but don't forget why we're here.
Because we're dedicated detectives.
- Because Peralta jumped the gun.
- Yep.
Get to work.
So we both had good answers.
This isn't a joke.
You're ruining our weekend.
Okay, I'm sorry you had to cancel dinner with your dad.
Date.
I had a date.
Hey, if Jake says the guy did it, that usually means the guy did it.
Thank you.
Everyone listen to Rosa.
No, I'm still furious at you.
Okay, no one listen to Rosa.
She's clearly an accomplice to this crime.
I'm gonna go take another crack at Whitman.
You've been in there, like, five times.
What are you gonna do?
Annoy him into talking?
Ha, ha.
Two, three, four.
Aah!
Didn't work.
Thank you.
Did not work.
Hey, Captain.
Will you please let everyone else go?
I feel bad that I ruined their weekend, and I can tell they're pissed at me.
I mean, Charles hasn't tried to high-five me all morning.
Yes, I've taken the brunt of that.
Kitchen buds.
Are you sure Whitman did it?
Yes, I'm positive.
Then the whole team stays.
We have a better shot with everyone on it.
Fine, will you at least tell Hitchcock to go home?
His mouth smells like rotten trout milk.
Is there such a thing?
I'm just telling you what it smells like.
Get out.
- Do you have the bank records?
- Mm-hmm.
Good thing I didn't reschedule my date for tonight.
We're never leaving here.
Well, maybe that's a good thing, you know?
Saved you from another lame internet date with some lame guy named Dirk or Mar garine.
He's not lame, okay?
He works with a friend of mine.
He has a human name.
And I'm not telling you what it is, because you'll look him up and make fun of him.
I can't believe you think so little of me that you would just automatically assume Is it Luke Mueller?
How did you do that?
Well, you only have one friend Kylie.
And she has seven male coworkers.
Goatee, goatee, jaunty fedora, profile pic is a sunset, Tasmanian devil tattoo, goatee.
Leaving Luke as the only viable option.
Well, he's nice, and he uses proper punctuation in texts.
- Dreamboat.
- And I wanted to go out with him.
All right.
You know what?
Reschedule for tonight.
I promise I will get us out of here in time.
Fine.
I'm holding you to that.
Where's he taking you?
Terrific, let's get everyone involved.
Dinner and a movie.
Dinner and a movie is the perfect first date.
I think the perfect first date doesn't feel like a first date at all, because you've known each other for a few years, maybe even work together.
And one night you're laughing, and then all of a sudden, it's just like blammo!
Kissing.
Cheap dinner, watch basketball, bone down.
So pretty much the same as what I said.
None of the partials match Whitman.
If he did it, he didn't leave any prints.
Maybe he doesn't have any.
Interesting fact about me I once burnt my fingerprints off on a wok.
Hi, hello.
What are you doing?
Holt said you didn't have to come in here.
You don't come in on days you're supposed to work.
Because I'm so nice, I brought two pies.
One is from Crust.
And one's also from Flatbush Diner.
Hey, you know what might be fun?
Charles could try them and tell us which one is better.
How fun is that?
- So fun.
- Yay!
Yum, yum, yum.
Yummy.
You got a second, Captain?
I've got these overtime forms for you to s Are you stifling a yawn?
- No, sir.
- Go home, sergeant.
I'm fine.
And I filled this out.
I just need you to Permission to yawn, sir.
Go home.
Please, I'm begging you.
- Oh, fair enough.
- Yeah.
That's for women.
- These your glasses?
- Mm-hmm.
They're gigantic.
My contacts dried out, thanks to you.
And they're cool.
No, they're not.
Wow, you are blind blind.
- Yeah.
- You're a blind cop.
How has there not been a made-for-TV movie about your struggles?
Give those back.
Yeah, okay.
Wait a minute.
I did it.
I got Whitman, dead to rights.
I can still make my date?
As I promised.
Go get changed.
And by that, of course I mean throw your glasses in the garbage, then get laser surgery, then recuperate And she left the room.
It's all right.
Out of 12?
Why?
For the 12 components of food satisfaction: Salty, sweet, sour, bitter, umami, odor, sound Sound?
Come on, Charles.
Try her nasty pie.
Oh, wow.
That's the best pie I ever had.
No, no.
- No, no, no.
- What's this?
We were running calls to pawn shops and then waiting for them to call back.
I didn't ask what you were doing.
I asked what you are doing.
Pie taste test, it's over.
I won.
That's unacceptable.
If you wanna know which restaurant has better pies, you can't just have one guy try one pie from each place.
Everybody needs to try all the pies from both places.
We gonna be here awhile.
Debit card statement.
You were at a parking meter two blocks from the jewelry store an hour before the robbery.
Oh, no, you found out About my wife.
We both have cards, because we share a joint account, because we love each other.
You're incapable of love, and I'll prove it!
Oh, I'm very tired.
I want my lawyer, now.
Ugh!
You have changed.
You used to go straight to prison!
Did Whitman talk?
Oh, he talked all right.
He asked for his lawyer.
By using words, which is technically talking.
We can't ask him any more questions till we find his lawyer, and we can't find his lawyer anywhere.
I'm sorry.
Aah, come on.
Why is there pie here?
That's not good.
I think the world of you, as a colleague and friend.
- Shut up, Peralta.
- Yep.
- Yes!
- Another one for Crust.
It's not looking good for Flatbush Diner.
Ah, come on!
You went home and showered?
That's so unfair.
I'm just glad I keep a toothbrush here.
Oh, cool.
Hey, can I borrow it?
Uh, why do you wanna borrow the toothbrush?
What possible answer could he give that would make you say yes?
I wanna brush my teeth.
Jake, it's been in my mouth.
That's the grossest thing I've ever heard.
That's the grossest thing you've ever heard?
You caught a guy on the subway with a bag of human ears.
Your thing's grosser.
Bring out the meringues.
I brought a few more.
That's so many.
You wanted something, sir?
Look, it's impossible to make you leave.
But you do have to sleep, and that's an order.
Sir, this is not necessary.
Also, can't sleep without my whale songs.
Terry, I've seen this before.
Problems at home, so you stay late at the job, but that only makes it worse.
Everything's great with my wife.
It's just, my brother-in-law's in town, and we do not get along.
- He thinks I'm a weakling.
- You?
Let me get that for you.
I can do it.
Tiny Terry loves his pickles.
He makes me feel so small.
Who cares what he thinks?
You're a police sergeant.
You're a grown man.
Now take your nap.
And if I see the lights on in here, I'm gonna be very disappointed in you.
Are you the idiot that made a Friday night arrest?
I was in the poconos with my wife.
You ruined my entire weekend.
Get in line, because that's their attitude.
Get your own attitude.
He has an alibi, geniuses.
He was at Torque.
It's a nightclub in Cape May, New Jersey, all night.
Nice try.
You think I'm gonna waste six hours driving to the Jersey Shore and back on some fake alibi?
It's up to you.
But in ten hours, he walks.
More like in ten hours, he walks into prison, when we bust him.
Let's follow up on his alibi.
- Yep, you heard him, Scully, hit the road.
- No.
You should've looked into this before you made the arrest.
You go.
Oh, Captain, I'm happy to go.
I love the saltwater taffy down there.
Scully loves the saltwater taffy down there.
No, Peralta's going.
Go, Peralta.
Look, I know I caused this problem, but I can fix it.
We just got some new security footage in.
Let me stay here and go through it.
I'm gonna prove that Whitman was at the scene of the crime, even if it kills me.
This is killing me.
Good.
Die.
You know, if it does come to that, I have but one wish before I go.
Can I please put your glasses on my penis?
I just think that would be really funny.
Hey, can you make copies of these warrant requests for me?
I'm not your secretary.
You're everyone's secretary.
That's literally your job.
And your job is lying about your taste buds?
I'm sorry about the whole pie blowup thing.
You're right.
The Flatbush Diner pie is awful.
- Thank you.
- It's just I want Rosa to like me.
All right, do whatever you want, but most women don't really like it when dudes lie to them.
Except for me, but I'm wired to thrive on dysfunction.
Nothing.
Wait, wait, wait.
This guy black knit cap.
Come on, come on, come on.
Gotcha!
Ugh, it's not him.
Let's just arrest this guy.
Who even cares anymore?
So how'd my new best friend Luke take it when you cancelled on him again?
Don't know, hasn't called me back.
Which is what always happens, because it's impossible to be a cop and date.
Amy, look.
There is a guy out there with incredibly low standards and a super weird soul patch, and he is waiting for you.
Amy, my patch tingles for you.
We will wed on the isle of New Jersey.
Our first dance will be to Jessie's girl, because my name is definitely Jessie.
- It's so romantic.
- Hey, guys.
Hey.
Yeah, there's good news, and there's bad news.
The bad news is my saltwater taffy place was closed.
And the good news?
Whitman's alibi checked out.
Security footage from Torque shows he was there.
That's not good news.
- That's bad news.
- Right.
That is bad news.
Sorry, it's on me.
No, Detective Scully, it's on Peralta.
No, Captain, that's on Santiago.
It's on me.
It's still on me.
This is such a disaster.
It's not good.
D.A.'s furious.
Whitman and his lawyer are in my office right now, gunning for a lawsuit.
No, not that.
My brother-in-law is coming to have dinner with me on his way to JFK.
But also the botched investigation, that's bad too.
Okay, what can I do?
Oh, your services will not be necessary, because you need to go home and change for your date.
- What?
- I called handsome Luke.
I explained the weekend was entirely my fault, partially.
And he wants to go out with you tonight.
- Thanks, Peralta.
- You're welcome.
Just promise me you won't use the condoms in the secret pocket of your purse, okay?
- They're expired.
- How do you know what's in my purse?
I needed concealer for a zit.
Plus, you know, we spend so much time together here, I know everything about everyone.
I know Hitchcock went bald at 15.
Scully used to date Hitchcock's wife.
Charles has a bike with a little basket on the front.
How else would you carry baguettes?
And Rosa has a shower in her apartment, I think.
I got nothing on her.
Good.
Well, I guess we did just spend 48 hours locked in here together.
Holy crap.
- What?
- Locked in here together.
So we will be filing a wrongful arrest suit against the NYPD.
And when I win, I'm gonna buy club Torque, put a statue of Jake Peralta right in the middle of the dance floor.
First off, that's a terrible threat.
I would love to have a statue of myself in the middle of a dance club.
Second Do me a favor, take a look at this picture, and tell me what you see.
You and Regis Philbin.
Awesome, right?
Surprisingly down-to-earth guy and definitely not the picture I meant to show you.
But take a look at this.
That's right, it's you and your old cell mate Marcus Cole.
And here he is again outside the jewelry store.
The two of you planned this together in prison.
You taught him your M.O, he pulled off the robbery, you got yourself an alibi, and you split the loot.
Oh, man, I can't believe he caught us.
Of course he did, Peralta is the best!
Aw, thanks, Reg.
That's enough.
Yeah, I gotta work on my Regis.
Anyway, see ya in jail, Whitman.
You got anything else to say?
Hey, Rosa, the Flatbush Diner's pie is terrible.
It's inedible.
Food is supposed to be edible.
So you were lying?
What the hell, Boyle?
Put it in the suck-it bucket.
Crust isn't any better.
It's fancier, but it's all bells and whistles.
Desserts don't need to be clever.
They just need to be good.
This is the best pie in New York City Apple from Argos Bakery, founded 1910.
Recipe unchanged.
Taste it.
Damn, it is amazing.
This pie is so good, I hate it.
You just graduated pie school, bitches.
Sorry I said "bitches," I'm just really worked up.
Yow!
Mmm, what is that?
Sorry for screwing up everyone's weekend.
Hey, uh, drinks on me.
Who's in?
Oh, no way.
No, I got the date.
I gotta change.
- Come on.
- Everyone's tired, Peralta.
They just wanna go home.
Yeah, but I have to prove I'm not selfish, so I don't care what they want.
That sounded bad.
And to make up for what I did, I'll cover one shift each for all of you.
No kidding?
- Except Santiago.
- What?
I got you your date back.
One nice thing from me is all you get.
So this is my desk.
Desk jockey, huh?
You just sit here, eat your pickles, wait for the criminals to turn themselves in.
Actually, I don't like pickles that much.
Terry, I'm glad I found you.
There's been a development in the Russian mob case.
Oh?
Yeah, our killer has been spotted in the warehouse down by the canal.
Get your gear.
So you want me first through the door, sir?
Oh, it's just you.
The SWAT team is on another call, so you'll have to do it alone.
Hey, I'm not gonna be able to make dinner tonight.
Hey, no, do your thing, do your thing.
Go, Terry.
You can crash on my couch.
I even downloaded you some whale songs.
Thank you, sir.
I'll never forget it.
Good night, Terry.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Careful!
You only get one shot at this, Peralta.
Don't worry.
I know what I'm doing.
I saw the first 15 minutes of The Hurt Locker.
Hurry!
The stench is too much.
We gotta get those shoes outta here.
How much time do we have?
Scully ate his pot pie so we probably got 10 minutes left on this nap.
All right, come to papa.
It's trapped.
Abort mission.
I have an idea Let's send these shoes to hell.
Oh, wait.
Yeah, just smells worse than before.
Oh Ugh!
Abort!
Whoa!
Why are you here before me?
Am I asleep?
Is this a dream?
I am early because Jimmy Brogan is here today.
Why do you care so much about some old reporter?
Some old reporter?
Is the sky just some big blue hat that the world wears?
No.
And no one has ever thought that.
My point exactly.
Jimmy Brogan wrote The Squad about badass New York cops in the '70s.
It's the best book I've ever read, and I've read 15 books.
Wait You said 15?
The Squad is what made me decide to become a Detective.
And it was my first book report.
"The detectives wiped the mobsters' blood off their boots and found the scag".
Scag is heroin, and the book says it's so good, you can never stop doing it!
See me after class, Jacob.
Fun side note I late lost my virginity to Mrs. Stratton's daughter.
It was very fast.
Nice.
Mr. Brogan, these are detectives Santiago and Peralta.
Mr. Brogan, I am a huge fan of your book.
Would you mind signing my copy?
I'd love to.
It's always nice to meet a fan.
You can just make it out to "death wish".
That's what everyone calls me, 'cause I'm always first through the door.
You go through doors normally, and everyone calls you pineapples.
My grandma calls me pineapples, and I regret telling you that.
Those New York cops from the '70s you wrote about were my idols I mean, Gaminsky, Cavanaugh, Quigg.
Those guys were the real deal.
I once saw Gaminsky choke a hippy to death with his own ponytail.
Illegal.
Love that.
Mr. Brogan is writing an article about how Brooklyn detectives have changed in the 35 years since The Squad.
He'll be observing the two of you on your Internet identity theft case.
I hope Mr. Brogan's presence doesn't prove to be a distraction to you, Peralta.
Distracted?
Me?
No, sir.
Evil would love that.
But I'm not giving evil the satisfaction.
Not today.
Where's the can?
I gotta unload.
"Unload".
Great choice of words.
It'd be an honor to show you, sir.
All right.
Everyone's here.
Today we're gonna work on our courtroom demeanor.
Pass.
This seminar is not optional, Diaz.
You're testifying in an aggravated assault case tomorrow.
The D.A. is worried about how you present yourself on the stand.
Why?
I'm fine on the stand.
Look, I'll make this real simple so even these dum-dums can understand.
Man did crime.
I'm sorry can you make her stop doing that weird thing with her face?
Crying?
And when this is over, I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna break those little fingers.
Ms. Diaz.
Please stop threatening the stenographer!
This is an important case.
You need to do well.
Fine.
I'll take your dumbass seminar.
That's the spirit!
Someone has placed tiny scanners inside ATMs to steal card numbers and pins which they sell on the Internet.
Oh, good God, why do you smell like an ashtray?
Oh, sorry, mom.
It's the only way I can cope with the stress of the job.
Pffft!
Anyway We're running an algorithm to comb through the transactions looking for a pattern which will lead us to the perp's IP address.
Got it.
"Boring mumbo jumbo".
Well, you could think of the algorithm as a boot and the IP address as some poor slob's skull.
You know?
We used to call guys who bragged about sitting around all day hair bags.
Except for Detective Finaldi.
No, he had to sit around all day.
A mafia thug pried both his kneecaps off with a crowbar.
Gah so lucky.
This kind of data-driven police work has reduced crime by over 70%.
I know hair bag work when I see it.
Do me a favor wake me when your shift is over.
No way.
That is amazing!
All you need is for a jury to like you.
If they like you, they'll trust you.
Fine.
How do I get these morons to like me?
Don't call them morons.
Good instinct!
Okay.
Sit up straight, all right?
Be aware of your hands, okay?
And don't be afraid to smile.
And if you need to buy time, you can always just say, "to be perfectly candid" To be perfectly candid I like that.
And always make good eye contact.
But don't stare at people.
Yeah.
You gotta blink.
But don't blink too much.
Or too fast.
I think the bigger worry is slow blinks.
Don't blink too fast or too slow or too much or too little.
I know how to blink.
Quick question, sir.
You know how we've been trading favors back and forth and it's your turn to give me one?
None of that is true.
Yeah, I know.
Please, can I jump onto a sweet mob-related homicide?
There are no sweet mob-related homicides on which to jump.
Boom!
There's one at the seven-three.
Maybe I should roll over there, help out.
Brogan can tag along, maybe write some stuff down.
Why do you idolize that man and the time he wrote about?
Because the '70s were amazing.
I mean, everyone had thick, juicy moustaches and all the clothes were orange and flammable.
The '70s were not a good time for the city or for the department Corruption, brutality, sexism.
Diaz and Santiago never would have made Detective, and an openly gay man like me I never would have been given a command.
There were very few black detectives.
Did I ever tell you what my first day on the job was like?
Hello.
I'm Raymond Holt.
Are you here to turn yourself in?
Ah, yeah, that's really messed up.
But the guys that Brogan wrote about They were great detectives.
I mean, they were legit.
Some of them were legit.
Some of them were just Brogan's drinking buddies.
Sir, that is a brilliant idea.
It wasn't an idea.
It was a scathing indictment of your personal hero.
Eh, six of one.
This is the best!
Drinking with Jimmy Brogan.
So tell me more about Quigg.
Could he really light a matchstick on his face?
One time during a drug bust, he had one of his fingers shot off.
He didn't even flinch.
He just picked it up and used it to flip off every puerto rican in the place.
And that's my cue.
It's late.
Are you kidding?
The old guard drank till dawn, ate some coffee grounds, then started the whole day all over again.
Pfft!
I eat coffee grounds.
Sure you do, pineapples.
How about another round?
Are you kidding me?
I wanna hang with you till one of us dies.
Look, I'm tired of talking.
Why don't you tell me some of your stories?
Great.
'Cause I got some stories that'll make Training Day look like Super Troopers.
Eh, it's not bartender.
Two scotches.
No, no, he meant two bottles.
What?
I mean yeah!
Aaaalll right!
You'll never get me!
You'll never get me!
We already got you, idiot.
Look who's here.
How was your night of old-school drinking, hmm?
Pretty hung over?
Shh!
Turn off your mouth siren.
Here are the texts I got from you last night.
"Best night ever".
"Why scotch burn so good"?
"Whaz his name in Serpico"?
"Who's the friend of yours with the ping-pong"?
And lastly, a picture of you on the subway platform eating Chinese chicken salad with no shirt on.
Well, last night was awesome.
We had an epic night of bonding that I will never forget.
Do it!
I believe in you.
Throw it!
I believe in you.
Man, I wonder if Brogan's okay.
He's 65 and drank two bottles of scotch.
He might be dead.
He looks fine to me.
Morning, kid!
Ooh!
How ya doing?
Uh hey So good.
I feel great.
And I definitely don't think it's burning hot in here.
Well, I'm around.
Grab me if anything develops in your case.
You got it.
That hurt so bad.
Let me know when he's gone so I can slide onto the nice, cool floor.
He's gone.
Great.
Mmm Oh my whole body has dry mouth.
Why are we meeting in the ladies' room?
It's the perfect place for our second lesson Courthouse wardrobe.
What's wrong with the way I dress?
You know, some people might say that all the black leather kind of makes you looks like an evil villain.
Not me.
I think you look like a sexy motorcycle.
Boyle, pull it together.
Yeah.
We need to soften up your look.
My wife and Charles's mom donated some clothes.
Your wife and Boyle's mom are both blind?
I look like arsenio.
So it's perfect?
That's actually my wedding suit.
No.
Yes.
No.
No.
That's great.
Perfect!
You look beautiful ly Appropriate for court.
A new sensation Ohh Scully.
Hey, Jake.
You've been alive forever.
How'd you used to cure hangovers?
Oh, I didn't drink.
I was, however, extremely into cocaine for most of 1986.
I gotta tell you the truth, Hitchcock Can I tell you the truth?
You and me, man.
We're gonna be co-captains.
But first I'm taking you to Japan!
I'm already packed!
I had three heart attacks that year and declared bankruptcy.
Hitchcock turned out just fine.
My grandpa was an old-school cop.
This was his hangover cure Raw egg yolks.
Aaahhh!
You look like a corpse we just pulled out of the river.
Wrong.
I look like a cool rock star who oded in his own pool.
Big difference.
I told you not to let Jimmy Brogan distract you from your work.
So I assume you're not too hung over to do said work?
Pfft.
Nope.
It's like I never even drank.
And that's not a hangover cure.
What, that?
Naw, it's just some Protein for my guns.
I drink one every morning before I lift.
So Gah!
Ah ha ha!
So good!
You can barely even tell it's a chicken embryo.
You should drink it all.
For your guns.
Yeah.
Agh.
Ah, it's just like Fitness, right?
Oh, why did I do this?
According to your text, you were having "the beef light of my loaf".
What?
No, no.
Why did I use this algorithm?
We're only tracking people who use the stolen cards.
They might not be the same as the ones who stole them.
Here, switch seats with me.
Oh, wow.
Your butt's really warm.
My butt's normal.
Your butt's the weird one.
Don't be mad.
It's nice.
All right, so if we ignore all these fraudulent purchases and go back far enough Here.
Someone posted the stolen card numbers online from this IP address.
Not bad!
You found the pattern.
All right, let's aspirin up and roll out!
Ah ohh!
Ohh I'm glad you could be here for this.
Mike Halbrook.
NYPD.
Open up.
Put your head through the door.
My head?
We got a runner!
Stop!
Hands in the air!
Oh, wow.
Hoo!
Yeah!
Good job.
I'm never drinking again.
Hey.
You know, I was gonna take him out myself, but ladies first, so Relax, kid.
Being too hung over to chase a perp?
That's a classic old-school move.
You know, you are one of the last few good cops fighting against the rising tide of hair bags.
That's what you're gonna say in your article?
Ah, don't worry, you're gonna come out lookin' real good.
Especially after our talk in the bar.
Ah So many good quotes!
Especially about Holt.
Cops are usually afraid to go after their captains like that, but you, sir, are old-school.
You know it.
Oh, pineapples What did you do?
Your witness counselor.
Detective Diaz, it's always a pleasure to see you.
This is not good.
The lawyer is that slimeball grundhaven Rosa hates him!
She's dressed right.
We coached her.
She'll be okay.
Would you please state your name for the record?
To be perfectly candid My name is Detective Rosa Diaz.
Well, thank you for your candor regarding your own name.
Detective Diaz, would you please tell the court exactly how you're involved in this case?
I caught Mr. Ladd physically beating his boss with a fax machine.
Most of his cheek was caved in.
His head was basically a blood fountain.
I'm sorry, is this amusing to you, Ms. Diaz?
Blinking.
Oh, no.
Brogan just sent me the quotes he's gonna run.
I slammed Holt like 50 times.
Listen.
"Holt would rather I wear a tie "than solve a case.
"Holt cares more about catching clerical errors "than catching bad guys.
Holt is way too verticulis"?
That's not even a word!
What were you thinking?
We were just hanging out, being old-school.
He wasn't supposed to quote me.
I was off the record the whole time.
Oh, no wait.
I'm goin' on the record.
Jake Peralta Can dance!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Jimmy Brogan!
You need to fix this, okay?
Those quotes cannot run.
It would be devastating for Holt.
And the department.
I'll fix it.
Brogan's a cool guy.
We're friends now.
I'll just talk to him, awesome dude to awesome dude.
I should brush my teeth first, though, right?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's terrible.
Ugh!
Great advice, dummies.
I look like a psycho up there!
Yes.
You have to pull it together.
That's not helping!
That's what sarge says to me when I'm nervous.
Rosa, I think you're nervous.
Of course I'm nervous!
What did you think was the problem?
We just assumed you were a terrifying human being with a short fuse.
But if the problem is that you're nervous, that's where Charles Boyle lives, baby.
I can help!
You just need to go to your happy place.
What's that?
Sounds stupid.
Oh, everyone's happy place is different.
For me, I just imagine I'm slurping up the world's longest piece of linguini.
It just keeps going and going.
Every 20 feet of noodle, there's a sauce change.
I'm in my happy place right now.
Mmm pesto.
Mmm!
Carbonara!
Great!
Now I'm starving!
Hey, hey, Jimmy Brogan.
Thanks for meeting me.
Welcome to the Schvitz, kid.
The most comfortable place on earth.
It's like crawling back into your mother.
Is that something people wanna do?
What'd you wanna talk to me about?
So I read those quotes you sent me, and you Wrote them so good.
The thing is I know I hid it incredibly well, but I was pretty drunk when I said that stuff, so Any chance you wouldn't print it?
Well, you said you were going on the record.
I was clearly not in control.
Well, maybe you should learn to handle your brown.
Eew.
Look, you know that I think you're like the number one hero of the 20th century.
But kinda feel like you're being unfair here.
"Feel like"?
Listen to her, Suzanne Somers over here.
Talk like a man.
All right, I will talk like a man.
You got me drunk and took advantage of me.
Oh, come on.
Gah!
Look, I'm asking you nicely Please don't print the quotes.
And I'm telling you nicely, I'm printing them.
No, you're not.
What are you gonna do about it?
Hey, how'd it go with Brogan?
Perfect.
Except I punched him in the face and made everything a billion times worse.
What?
Yeah.
So, Detective Diaz, you saw my client struggling with his boss, but you don't know who initiated the fight.
To be perfectly candid, I was pretty sure it was the defendant.
Oh, to be perfectly candid, "pretty sure" is not definitive.
I think I know what happened.
Well, to be perfectly candid, no one cares what you think.
Do you actually know anything, or are you just guessing?
Your client instigated the fight.
I'm certain.
And I'm happy to tell you why.
Yes!
She went to her happy place.
I know that, Boyle.
You punched Jimmy Brogan?
What were you thinking?
I was thinking that I needed to protect this precinct.
From things that I said about this precinct to a reporter while drunk and insisting he record me.
I shouldn't have done it.
Unbelievable.
Every time I think you might make a decent Detective, you go and pull something like this.
I thought I could handle my brown.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's gross.
Go home!
You got the rest of the day to put your head on straight.
Got Halbrook to cop to every charge.
Nice work, Santiago.
Thank you, sir.
Peralta figured out the pattern, though, so he should get credit for the collar.
Have you seen him?
I sent him home.
He assaulted Jimmy Brogan.
Yeah.
But that caveman kinda had it coming, don't you think?
Oh.
He didn't tell you.
Tell me what?
Never mind.
If Jake didn't tell you, he must have had a reason.
It's not my place.
I'm disappointed in you, Santiago.
I thought you and I were close.
I know you're manipulating me But I love it, and I will tell you anything.
So Jake went to the Schvitz to talk to Brogan.
What are you gonna do about it?
There's nothing I can do Except to ask you nicely as a fan of you, your work, and the guys you wrote about Please don't print the quotes.
Sheesh.
I didn't realize you were gonna get your panties all in a pretzel!
That's actually not technically possible.
I'm not wearing underwear.
It is swampy in here.
My butt's like the everglades.
Look, I know you're trying to be legit in a hair bag world, so I will not print your quotes.
Ah, thank you, thank you!
That means the world to me.
And for the record, I know that Holt is a stickler, but he's actually a really good cop.
Don't worry about it.
We're friends.
You don't have to stick up for that homo.
I really wish you hadn't just said that.
What, homo?
Ooh!
Thank you, Santiago.
That'll be all.
Here she is.
Diaz, you did it.
They found him guilty on all charges.
Huh.
Boyle's advice worked.
So Where's your happy place?
I'm in a cabin in the middle of nowhere.
Inside it's just me and that stupid, slimy defense attorney.
And I'm beating the hell out of him.
I break a dining room table over his head.
Then I rip off his arm and shove it where the sun don't shine.
Then I reach down his throat and shake his hand.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm gonna go ahead and schedule you for a psych eval.
I owe you one, Boyle.
Thank-you dinner.
Tomorrow night.
Gribaldi's.
It's all-you-can-eat linguini.
Yes!
Oh, my boyfriend's coming too.
Your what friend now?
All right.
Let's hear it.
Well, it's even worse than I imagined.
"The new face of the NYPD is perfectly embodied by Brooklyn's own Jake Peralta" That's not so bad.
"Who cowers behind his desk all day like the true hair bag that he is".
There it is.
"The old guard would have eaten a guy like Peralta for breakfast and unloaded him by lunch".
Well, it's very colorful.
And hurtful.
You can ignore that garbage, Santiago.
Jimmy Brogan wouldn't know a legit cop if he punched him in the face.
Well Guess I'm done with this.
Not good enough.
Three, two, one Welcome to the party, pal!
God, you love that movie.
It's Die Hard.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Oh, this is amazing.
This is so amazing.
Everything about this is amazing.
What are you talking about?
A virus got on the server and sent all of us an email with everyone's search histories.
Check this out.
Sergeant Jeffords searched the Internet for "undiscovered muscle".
I was working out and saw a muscle in my shoulder I'd never seen before.
I thought it might've been a scientific discovery.
Listen to this.
Scully searched for "how much fudge is in a calorie"?
I never found the answer, but it was a good question.
Boyle looked up, "how to make desk yogurt".
Yes, I did, and I am thrilled with the results.
Although the jar is really hot.
That's gross.
And Amy searched for "Daniel Craig hands" plus "close up".
Ugh.
You should talk.
You searched for "cheapest date possible".
And I wear that search like badge of honor.
So, ready for dinner?
Here we go.
Would you like something sweet?
Or maybe savory?
Apple pie And I'm stuck.
I'm stuck!
Peralta.
Hey, Sal.
To what do I owe the honor?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, we'll be right there.
Boyle No!
I can't believe Sal's is gone.
This place is an institution.
It's the best pizza in the neighborhood.
Well, eighth-best.
But yeah, a tragedy.
I mean, any food-related crime is a tragedy.
Oh, no.
Heads up, fire marshal.
Oh, Boone.
What's that nimrod doing here?
Hey, Peralta.
Hey, Boone.
What are you doing here, you nimrod?
Uh, there was a fire.
Big question is, what are you doing here?
What, did somebody call in a missing doughnut?
Uh, actually someone reported they couldn't find your head.
But we found it.
It was up your butt.
You're a fireman, you should know how to treat that burn.
Joke's on you, 'cause this is a fire, which means it is fire department jurisdiction.
So why don't you back off and let New York's bravest handle it?
You know they only call you that because "New York's best at spraying stuff with water" is too wordy.
Ha, well, it's too bad we all can't be as awesome as New York's finest, which by the way, sounds like my mom describing her dishware, which and she's dead, so let's tread lightly on the response.
- That's not fair.
- Yeah.
Well, look, we heard this might be arson, so we wanted to check it out.
No, I'm not letting you onto my crime scene.
Okay?
All right, fine.
You know what?
You're not invited to our next murder.
Good solve on the Herman Avenue burglaries.
Finish up the paperwork as soon as possible.
Your wish is my command.
No, that was actually a command.
So my command is your command.
Well, then I guess you still have all three of your wishes.
- You're not a genie.
- I know that.
Okay.
We're leaving.
What was the name of the clerk we questioned about the second burglary?
Where do farts go?
I was reading Scully's searches.
Hey, why'd you do a search for "magic-themed singles night"?
My last four dates were really boring, so I thought I'd mix things up.
Oh, wow.
Ta-da!
Oh, no.
What about you?
Why were you looking for real estate in Ropesburg, New Jersey?
Ropesburg P.D. Offered me a job as their new police Captain.
I turned it down.
Oh!
You Captain.
Oh that's super Super cool.
If we're gonna figure out what happened at Sal's, we've gotta get past those firemen.
We need access.
How 'bout this?
We light a bunch of fires throughout Brooklyn, and when the firemen go to "fight the fires," we walk right into Sal's, the crime scene's ours.
Why do we want to start a turf war with the fire department?
I feel very uncomfortable saying this to you, but it doesn't seem like it's worth it - Unless you think it is.
- I do.
Like I said, Sal's is an institution, and it's the best pizza in the neighborhood.
I'm sorry, Jake, Sal's is only the eighth-best.
I put out a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email blast.
Sal's has the fourth-best texture, ninth-best crust, twelfth-best cheese, and honestly, they're only seventh in mouth-feel.
"Mouth-feel"?
What is that?
The inside of your cheeks are very sensitive.
It's like the inside of your thighs, except with a tongue.
Ugh, God.
Look, no, Sal's has the secret sauce recipe that puts all the other pizza places to shame.
But more importantly, fire marshal Boone is incapable of conducting a crime investigation.
All fire marshals are doofuses, but Boone is King doofus of doofus island.
Gasoline?
I'm pretty sure that's water.
Only one way to tell.
There were more ways to tell.
And he's their leader.
Captain, here's the mope who hacked our computer system.
His mother turned him in.
His name is Corey Park.
My name is savant.
His web handle is "savant".
His people name is Corey Park.
Why'd you target us with your computer virus, Corey?
I don't know, I was bored, and it was easy to break into your weak-ass system.
It was like taking candy from a baby.
Why are you giving candy to a baby in the first place?
Don't give candy to a baby!
They can't brush their teeth!
Yes, sergeant, it is unwise to give babies candy.
If it's so easy for this gentlemen to break into our system, we may need to hire a new I.T. Director.
Why don't you and Gina get together on that?
I doubt I'll need Gina's help.
I'm sure she's busy anyway.
Use Gina.
She's my assistant, and she has something to offer.
Trust me.
Man, don't be hacking into my stuff.
Uh-oh, Jake, firemen.
What are you two doing here?
You're a Detective, you detect it out.
Good one, bro.
- I know, bro.
- Yeah, bro.
Wow, it's like watching meet the press.
Boone reconsidered.
He wants you to take a look at the files.
Well, that's unexpected, but All right, fine, I'll It's not a file, bro.
It's a doughnut, because you're cops.
You sure?
All right, I don't care if it's not our jurisdiction, we're solving this.
Would you like me to, uh, file that for you, Jake?
Just ask for the doughnut, Scully?
Can I have the doughnut, please?
Yes.
Thanks.
It's good to see you, Sal.
I'm so sorry about the fire.
I can't believe it's gone, Jakey, all of it.
The pizza oven.
The first dollar bill I ever made.
The 7-up fridge.
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
You'll rebuild.
The fire department's been asking a lot of questions.
Oh, fire department questions.
Let me guess.
"Uh, what part of my face do I put food in"?
"How do you count to one"?
"What's air"?
They think I torched my own place.
You know I wouldn't do something like that, right?
Yeah, of course.
But can you think of anybody who might've done it?
I could think of ten pizzerias that want me out of the game.
That jerk Mario comes to mind.
We share a delivery radius.
Mario is number ten overall in Brooklyn, and rising fast.
He might've wanted to move up the ladder.
Of one foodie weirdo's personal pizza email blast?
Yeah.
Okay, we'll start with him, then we'll move on to the rest of your competition, see if anything suspicious turns up.
It'll be the perfect opportunity to update my rankings.
Can we stop at home for a pizza bib?
No, Charles, we gotta go fast.
Right, right, I'll just use my work bib.
No, no bib.
We're gonna solve this for you, Sal.
Sit tight.
The guy who did the safe in the second apartment, what was his name?
Cone.
"C" as in "Captain".
"O" as in "overlooked".
- What?
- Nothing.
She said "C" as in "Captain," "O" as in "over" Yeah, I know how to spell cone.
Okay.
So, Ropesburg P.D. - You know someone there?
- Nope.
So you were looking for a new job?
- Nope.
- Weird.
They just offered you Captain without considering anyone else?
Like Scully Because he's got so many years on the force.
Hey, guys, I think I put my gun in one of these boxes, and I don't know which.
You have a problem with me that you want to talk about?
Me?
No, I am just filing evidence, sir.
Found my gun.
It was in my holster.
My holster's on my butt.
Good solve, Scully.
Mario, this pie needs work.
Good consistency on the crust, but the cheese-to-sauce ratio is a travesty.
Do you have to spit?
In a word, yes.
Amateurs go tasting, they fill up, and they lose their palate by the third slice.
I take this very seriously.
So, Mario Let me tell you what I think happened.
Your credit card transactions are down by 1/3 in the last six months.
Meanwhile, over at Sal's, it was a bunch of smiling faces and happy stomachs.
One night, you snapped.
A little gasoline fah!
A little match.
And poof!
No more Sal's.
How right am I?
The night of the fire, I was at my father's funeral.
Oh My condolences.
Ugh.
Gino This pizza is much better than last time.
You've always ranked dead last in structural integrity and sauce.
But way more importantly, I did a little research, and it turns out you did six months in prison for a b&e.
I did.
The night of the fire, I was at the prison giving a motivational speech on how parolees can turn their lives around.
Well, it's good to hear that the system works, and you are welcome.
Have a good one.
This is a dead end.
We've gotta check out that crime scene.
Can't.
Firemen locked it down.
Grab your spit bucket, Boyle.
Those hose monkeys can't stop us.
Ah, you must be Simon Walker.
Have a seat.
It says here you were an I.T. Specialist with the board of ed for two years.
Well, I know my way around a computer, that's for sure.
What's your favorite Jay-Z song?
I'm sorry?
Favorite Jay-Z song?
She's kidding.
Hmm.
No, I'm not.
What is it?
I don't know.
- I'm sorry about her.
- Okay.
What's your experience with cyber-security?
Uh, well, I added encryption software But seriously, what's your favorite Jay-Z song?
I don't know!
Big pimpin'?
It's big pimpin'!
Mm, wrong answer, friend.
And that's, um, how I got involved in, you know, systems analysis.
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous.
There's no need to be nervous.
Yeah, we're all just calm, cool, collected Wahh!
Oops.
Was that a little sudden?
What would you say is your biggest weakness as an employee?
Um I'm sorry, what was the question again?
He said, "what's your biggest weakness As an employee"?
That's just gross.
I'm sorry, I just have a skootch of gingivitis.
So I'm trying to treat that as best I can.
Sorry.
You seem disgusted.
Here's an itemized list of everything taken from the garden apartment.
TV, computer "Ster-b-eo"?
Uh-oh, spelling error.
That's not very Captain-y.
Oh, my God, enough.
I just think that you meant "stereo," not "ster-b-eo".
Did you mean "ster-b-eo," Captain?
That's it.
Get in my car, now.
And if you say another word, I promise you, you will regret it.
Aye aye, cap Ow, okay.
Fine, I regret it.
Ah I'll go.
I'm going.
These firemen are not moving.
We gotta distract 'em.
Tell 'em your little boy's cat got stuck up in a tree.
Ooh, undercover work.
I love it.
I need more back story.
First off, can it be my daughter's cat?
Okay, but if you get made because of that, it's on you.
Fine.
Let's talk about the cat.
Short-hair, long-hair?
Tabby?
Short-hair, calico.
The son is adopted.
Your wife is in a coma.
Oh, that's brutal.
I like it.
Hey, guys?
Guys, I really need your help.
My little boy, Brian, my angel, I bought him a short-haired calico after my wife fell into a coma Motorcycle crash.
And now the cat's stuck in a tree.
He's a cute kid.
Kinda looks like you.
Handsome guy.
Handsome little guy.
Oh, hey.
Just got locked out, so He doesn't care.
Brian was adopted, so he has abandonment issues.
Just struck out at tee-ball last week.
Everyone called him "cryin' Brian".
Hello, Peralta.
Aah!
You looking for something?
What is the deal with you and this second-rate pizza joint?
This place is a Brooklyn institution, and I'm here because you think Sal did it and you're wrong!
He did do it!
Sal was in financial trouble, he has no alibi, and in cases of arson, the owner always did it.
What's going on, sir?
What's going on is that Peralta has screwed with me for the last time, and now he's gonna pay.
Oh, you know what, Boone?
Any time you want to Well, that escalated fast.
They're getting nervous, Jake!
They're getting nervous!
Get off him, Boone!
You big marshmallow!
Hey, break it up!
Now!
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't tell my guys what to do!
Don't tell me what to tell people what to do!
Well, make me not do it, tough guy.
Uh-oh.
Hey, break it up!
I apologize, marshal Boone, for Detective Peralta's actions, something I find myself doing quite frequently.
In my defense, I was the only one saying we should stop hitting.
Stop hitting them!
Kicking them will hurt more!
Okay, I'm a reasonable man, so I'm just gonna say this.
Fire Peralta immediately.
He started a fight.
He overstepped his jurisdiction.
And he's obsessed with this pizza place.
What I'm obsessed with is how you're bungling this investigation.
They should write a song about it called welcome to the bungle.
Seriously, why are you dragging Sal's pizza through the mud?
That place is special.
Why's it special?
Because it's the best pizza in the neighborhood!
Well According to Charles's email blast, it's actually number eight.
Captain reads my blast.
Of course, it's the only one that measures mouth-feel.
What, are you kidding right now?
This isn't about pizza.
What's it actually about?
When I was a kid, I was shortstop on my little league team.
Oh, my God.
It's the truth.
It's not a brag.
My dad was the coach, and after every game, he would take the team to Sal's.
Halfway through our last season, he left me and my mom, and the worst part about it was that I couldn't go with him to Sal's anymore.
Well, that's certainly not what I expected this to be about.
Sorr I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that happened to you.
I mean, what kind of dad just Just leaves his son like that?
Look, you're You're a cop and And I'm a firefighter, but underneath all of it, we're just two boys whose dads abandoned them.
And you and I, we're gonna solve this thing, together.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
But first, let's hug like men.
Oh, boy.
This is happening.
Captain, get in here.
There, there.
There, there.
There.
I'm coming in.
Oh, Boyle.
What's going on?
Did you drive me out here to kill me?
I thought about it, but then I put that thought on hold.
I wanted to show you Ropesburg.
This is Ropesburg?
You wanted this offer so badly, I thought I'd give you a chance at the job.
Miss Diaz!
Are you here to reconsider?
We've bought the deputies bullets, like you suggested.
Hi, sergeant.
No, I'm still not interested.
At all.
But this is Detective Santiago.
She's one of our top detectives, and she really wants the job.
I Yes.
Can I ask what happened to the last Captain?
He quit to start a carpet cleaning business, because that was better than being Captain here because this is the most boring place on earth.
She doesn't mean that.
It's okay.
It's true.
Gotta be known for something.
So of all the candidates that you interviewed today, who do you think I should hire?
Well, the interviews got a little off-track.
But I'd go with Simon Walker.
Computer science degree, worked for the board of ed for ten years.
That guy?
No way.
He yelled at me when I asked him the same question about Jay-Z three times in a row.
Why does that matter?
Because whoever takes this I.T. Job is gonna have to deal with Hitchcock asking how to log in to his email every single day forever.
How do you think Professor short fuse is gonna handle that?
Fine, what about this guy?
Mm, no.
He was scared of everything.
Do you remember Rosa's reaction last time the printer jammed?
I'll pay for that.
Fine, what was with the flossing?
Mm, a precinct is a pretty gross place, ter-bear.
There's blood, wounds, Scully's feet.
You need a strong stomach, and that lady did not have one.
Plus, we already have the perfect candidate already: Savant.
That punk who hacked us?
Precisely.
Captain, turn your greatest weakness into your greatest strength, like Paris Hilton Her sex tape.
Get to the point.
Savant tore our walls down, but he can build them back up, taller and thicker than ever.
But how can we be sure he won't turn on us?
His mom ratted him out, so I bet he'd love a steady paycheck to get out of that snitch's house.
If I had a mic right now, I'd drop it.
There we have it.
And here's the file you wanted.
Well, it's hard to believe I'm gonna say this, because I've spent most of my adult life hating you and everything you stand for, but Thanks.
I'm not gonna lie, my therapist is gonna be very proud of me.
That's weird.
Any reason you can think of one of your guys would've forced this cabinet open while they were putting the fire out?
No, no.
I can't.
Looks like it was jimmied open with a crowbar.
Oh, my God.
I know who did it.
Come on, I'll explain it on the way down.
Wait, wait, wait.
I can't believe I'm offering this to a cop, but Do you want to take the pole down?
Oh, my God, yes.
Whee!
Let justice be served.
- Did you get it?
- Uh-huh.
My turn?
Nope.
No time.
Whoo!
We know you burned down Sal's, gino.
You hated him because his pizza was better than yours.
That's not true.
Gino's pizza's always been the tastiest.
Wrong.
According to Boyle's email blast, it was downright lousy before.
That's what made it so suspicious when he suddenly loved it.
Much better than last time.
The crust was charred, the cheese was stringy and flavorless, but the sauce.
Oh, Marone, the sauce.
Continue.
And that was your mistake.
You didn't just burn Sal's down, you also stole his secret sauce recipe.
Here's a picture of the cabinet in which said recipe was held.
Busted open with a crowbar.
Look familiar?
Also, your so-called motivational speech down at the prison ended at 5:00 P.M., leaving you plenty of time to get back to Sal's and burn it to the ground.
So I guess there's only one thing left to say.
Gino Bianucci, you're under arrest - Excuse me.
No.
- Do you mind?
This is my collar I think I can handle this.
If I'm not wrong.
Yeah, but I actually did all the work.
See, I knew you would You know what?
Fine.
Go ahead, I don't care.
Gino Bianucci, you're under arrest for arson.
Yes!
- Said it first.
- Real mature.
Very mature.
Off we go.
So what'd you think of Ropesburg?
It's, uh quaint.
It's whack, and you know it.
Their number-one crime is tricycle theft.
There's a bakery attached to the precinct.
Come on, Santiago.
You never would've taken that job, so why'd you even care that they offered it to me?
I can't help it.
I'm competitive.
I have seven brothers, and I was the only girl.
I always had to fight for a place at the table.
Well, you're not the only girl at the table anymore.
We work in a police force full of dudes.
We gotta have each other's backs, okay?
You saying you have my back?
Yeah, I got your back.
Don't smile.
I'm still mad at you.
I thought we were having a moment.
Moment's over.
Shut up.
Hey, sarge.
He made my computer smarter.
All I have to do is put my thumb on that thing, and it opens up all my electric mails.
You seem real smart, man.
Oh, and look, and you play with toys.
Savant, you're part of the nine-nine now.
We look after each other.
Hey, ball, if savant was to do anything to harm this precinct, would I destroy him?
Answer uncertain.
Try again.
Peralta, fire marshal Boone just called.
He told me you should check your drawer?
Oh, look at that.
I've been booned.
Well, the joke's on him, because I was out of shaving cream.
I see we are once again at war with the fire department.
You are not to retaliate.
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it, sir.
In fact, I'm gonna send over a little peace offering: Some of Sal's famous sauce.
Now, Boyle!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Pleasure working with you, Boone.
Run, Charles!
Come on whoa!
Get that guy!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
- Happy Turkey Day.
- Yes!
Right out of the gate.
What?
What's going on?
We're playing Boyle Bingo, Thanksgiving edition.
Everyone filled out their cards with possible Charles-related scenarios.
First to bingo gets 100 bucks.
I had "Boyle calls it 'Turkey Day'" on the center square.
"Boyle explains that they ate lobsters at the first Thanksgiving".
They did.
Back in that time, they called lobsters "ocean bugs".
- And I'll just mark it off for you.
- I think got the winning card here.
Boyle tells us that he played Pocahontas in his third grade play.
All the girls were too big.
This is a fun one "Boyle says, 'Gobble, gobble, gobble.
'" Well, now that I know you want me to say that, I'll just say it with two gobbles.
Gobble, gobble Gobble.
God, it just sounds right that way.
Ugh.
I don't like this game.
Ha!
"Boyle objects to Boyle Bingo".
- Come on, guys.
- Boyle says, "Come on, guys".
That's two for Terry.
Well, guess what.
I can spoil your little game by sitting over here quietly all day and doing nothing.
Anybody have "Boyle falls on the floor"?
- No one?
- That's a victory.
That's a victory for Boyle.
Boom!
Boyle says, "Boom"!
Season 1, Episode 10 "Thanksgiving" Check it out, chair jockeys.
While you were busy tickling the ivories on your computers, I was doing a bust.
Cocaine!
Thanks, Lucius.
He ran, I pursued.
Whole thing turned into an awesome car chase.
- Aah.
- NYPD!
Come on.
Move, move, move.
Hey there, criminal.
It's me, Johnny Law.
Well, at least you're done early, so you have time to go home and change for my Thanksgiving dinner.
Ugh.
Why do we have to dress up for Thanksgiving.
I don't even celebrate that stuff.
The whole holiday is based on overeating.
We should be wearing velvet track suits and diapers.
Jacket and tie.
Rosa's even wearing her formal leather jacket.
It's the one without any blood on it.
You're gonna dress up, and you're gonna give a toast about what you're thankful for.
Start preparing.
Oh, I prefer not to prepare for my toasts.
I just wing 'em like scat jazz.
- Are we singing?
- No, no, no, no.
OK That's nice.
You don't have to I'm not dressing up for your party.
Damn it, Boyle.
You left the fridge open.
The door couldn't shut because of your empty pizza box.
Pizza?
Please.
This is a butternut squash and truffle butter flatbread.
Everything's spoiled.
My lunch is ruined.
My chicken, my potatoes, my pasta, my meatballs, ham, my yogurt.
- Wow, that's a lot of yogurt.
- I love yogurt.
So this is your lunch for, like, the month?
I need to eat 10,000 calories a day to maintain muscle mass.
My wife made me all of this before she left town with the kids.
That was everything in my fridge.
- Scully.
- Hey-a, Sarge.
I know you got a secret stash of food hidden somewhere.
- Oh, no.
- Where is it?
- No, I don't.
- Is it in your pockets?
Oh, come on.
I'm gonna shake it out of your pockets.
Turn around.
Sarge.
Sarge!
Go limp, Scully.
This is fun.
Release your sweets.
Can I help you, Santiago?
Oh, Captain, didn't expect to see you there.
In my office?
So, I just wanted to make sure that you knew about the Thanksgiving dinner I'm hosting for the squad after work.
Yes, I received your "Save the date" decorative gourd, your ornamental cornucopia, and this beautiful handcrafted card of a turkey wearing a top hat.
- It's a pilgrim's hat.
- Where's the buckle, Santiago?
The buckle.
My husband's out of town for work, so of course I will attend your dinner.
Cool.
Whatever.
Yeah, don't worry about it, either way.
It's not a big deal.
- Yes!
- Why so excited?
Did you make the cover of "Hair Pulled Back" magazine?
The captain is coming to my party.
I'm gonna give a toast, tell him how thankful I am to have him in the precinct, and officially ask him to be my mentor.
Wait, are you only hosting dinner because you wanna suck up to Holt?
Not cool.
This was supposed to be about friendship.
You said you were only coming to see if my apartment was the reason I was single, or if it was my personality, like you suspected.
Yeah, but that was before I knew I could get up on this high horse.
Love the view up here.
Clip clop, clip clop, clip clop.
Same to you, Your Honor.
- Oh, what judge were you talking to?
- That was my mother.
You call your mom "Your Honor"?
She's a federal judge in the Ninth Circuit.
- What else would I call her?
- Yeah, okay.
Captain, paperwork is all done on that drug bust.
- What else you got for me?
- Nothing.
All open cases are assigned.
Come on, there's gotta be something I can investigate.
No, there's nothing.
All right, well, when there's nothing, there's nothing, you know?
What can you Whoa!
Who did that?
Don't worry, sir.
I will stay here all night figuring this out.
I know what you're up to here, Peralta.
Damn straight.
I'm trying to catch the mad paper scatterer.
You want an excuse to skip Santiago's Thanksgiving dinner, because for some reason, you refuse to celebrate this holiday like a normal person.
Fine.
You're right.
I wanna do what I do every year - Sit at home, watch football, and eat mayo nut spoonsies.
Those are spoonfuls of mayo, sprinkled with peanuts.
That's revolting.
Maybe so, but it's what I invented when I was six because my mom was working, so I had to make dinner for myself.
My sad story trumps your insult.
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
Thank you, Boyle.
If a case opens up, it's yours.
But if not, you will be at Santiago's as a professional courtesy.
Dismissed.
From what?
I thought we were just chatting.
We never chat anymore.
Oh, my God, Amy, that's so cool that you still live with your grandmother.
I live alone.
This is my stuff.
- I like quilts.
- Stop.
Each sentence is getting sadder.
It looks like you live on the set of Murder, She Wrote.
Well, I gotta say, it's not as bad as I thought it would be.
I mean, the football game's not on, so I can still watch it later at home.
And it's kind of cool to visit a time before electricity was invented.
I have to practice my toast.
- God, how long is that?
- Eight pages.
- Single-spaced?
- Double-sided.
- Santiago style.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, excuse me.
Can we please eat?
My body is starting to digest itself.
Terry needs nutrients.
No eating until the captain gets here.
- Okay?
Sorry.
- Don't apologize.
I'd rather spend Thanksgiving at your house than with my sister.
"Things you find a the beach".
- For "S", I had seagull.
- Good one, Diana!
- Ice cream break.
- Yay!
It's so pleasant and boring.
But, Holt, at your house, surrounded by these idiots?
Guaranteed train wreck.
Thanks for the invite.
He's here!
Okay, he's here, everybody.
Be cool.
Hitchcock, why do you have your shirt off?
Can't spill food on your shirt if you're not wearing one.
What - Captain Holt.
- Happy Thanksgiving.
Your apartment was very easy to locate.
Thank you so much.
You look beautiful.
Weirdest conversation ever.
Nice work, you two.
Before we eat, I'd like everyone to go around and say what they're thankful for this year.
Fine, I'll go first.
I am thankful that Thanksgiving only comes once a year.
People stuff themselves, and then at midnight they run to appliance stores and trample each other to death.
It's a garbage holiday.
I'm sorry, I just get emotional when I talk about how bogus Thanksgiving is.
I'll just go.
- I actually prepared a little something.
- You did?
When I was a little girl, playing cops and robbers Excuse me.
Please.
Continue, Santiago.
- Or I could wait.
- No waiting, just toasting.
I want you to toast.
Now I wanna eat toast.
- Give me some toast!
- OK, I'll be right there.
- I have to head back to the precinct.
- No.
Why?
Someone stole $10,000 from the evidence lockup.
Yes!
Oh, awesome.
- Why is that awesome?
- It's a case.
You said I could hop on any case that came up.
It's a Thanksgiving miracle.
Have fun, you guys.
Let's roll!
You'd think that one place money would be safe is a police station.
I hear that.
Remember when Santiago called you beautiful?
Yes, that was odd.
We need to get this money back, the exact bills, so the commissioner's office won't make our lives hell.
What is this?
Uh, this is Terry dancing.
People do the weirdest stuff in the evidence lockup when they think no one's watching.
Fast forward, fast forward, fast forward.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop, stop.
- Okay, so here's our money.
Fast forward.
Hold it, hold it, go back.
There's our guy.
Got him.
Okay, we should start by checking all the perps that were released from holding today.
- Good idea.
- And if's none of them, we may miss Santiago's altogether.
Thanksgiving is dead!
Santiago, can we please, please just eat?
What if captain Holt and Jake are coming back?
Hang on.
I have a toast.
I am thankful to have someone in my life who gives me a reason to get out of bed every morning.
And I hope that my relationship with this person will only grow more intimate.
Who are you talking about?
Um, Hitchcock.
OK, enough is enough.
I'm eatin'.
What's in these?
Potatoes, butter, a little milk.
Oh, and I ran out of salt, so I used baking soda.
Why wouldn't you?
They're both white powders.
Of course they're interchangeable.
Yeah.
There were two men released from holding today that were the right height and weight to be our thief on the security footage.
Even if it is one of them, how will we know?
Easy.
The guy on the footage was left-handed.
We just give all of our suspects some made-up form to sign, and see which hand they use.
All right, amigo.
Punch it.
Good.
Did that.
Now punch it.
Uh-huh.
Safety first.
Punch it!
Okay, see, now I just feel like you're messing with - Anyone want seconds?
- Can't.
I'm so stuffed.
- Amy, the toilet's overflowing.
- What?
Ew!
Scully, what did you do?
- And the night gets worse better.
- I didn't do it.
Although, I understand why you suspect me.
Well, then who clogged it?
So none of you ate anything?
Terry, you said you ate the whole turkey.
Toilet.
I ate one string bean.
It tasted like fish vomit.
- That was it for me.
- But I'm a good cook.
You all ate those brownies I brought in last week.
- I thought they were erasers.
- Charles said he loved them.
I'm a textbook people-pleaser.
I have a serious problem.
This was great though.
You must be so proud.
Yeah, Thanksgiving's over.
Everybody go home.
We're just We're done hanging out together.
I-I'm not done hanging out.
Let's go to the bar, they serve food there.
- That's a great idea.
- Oh, look at that.
"Boyle saves Thanksgiving".
- Does it really say that?
- No.
But it does say, "Boyle believes obvious lie".
Damn it.
So what's our strategy here?
I'm thinking maybe we could do the whole thing in character.
I'll play detective Bart Barley Tightly wound, hates violence against animals.
And you're my partner, Gerald Jimes A man who solved every crime, but one - The murder of his wife.
- Peralta, take this seriously.
I am.
As seriously as you're taking the search for the man who killed Jane Jimes.
Your only clue?
He wore a yellow sweater.
You're considering it.
Let's get in there.
NYPD.
What's going on?
I'm right in the middle of carving turkey.
I'm vegetarian.
Eating meat is murder.
- I hate violence against animals.
- Bup, bup, bup, bup.
We overlooked our release form we were supposed to have you sign.
We apologize.
Yeah, he's really right-handed.
Let's go.
Look out, bad guys it's Barley and Jimes Barley and Jimes are on the case Please refrain from make believe this time.
Fine.
Evening, ma'am.
NYPD.
Barley and Jimes.
- We're looking for Donny Romano.
- Ugh.
Come in.
Donny, what'd you do?
Cops are here.
What do you guys want?
Sorry to bother you, sir, my partner here forgot about a form we need you to sign.
What's happening, Donny?
What'd you do?
I didn't do anything.
It's not my fault.
- Same old story.
It's never you, is it?
- What did Donny do?
I swear, ma, I don't know what this is about.
- Why won't you ever believe me?
- 'Cause I raised a liar.
- You lie.
- Shut up, ma.
Hey, don't talk to ma like that.
Don't you tell me what to do, Louie!
Excuse me.
- Hey!
- Not the rolls!
George, do something.
Excuse me, if You know, you're gonna get hurt.
- Get off now.
- Get off.
My wife was murdered by a man in a yellow sweater!
It's the one case I can't solve.
Don't fight with family.
It can all go away so quickly.
Sign this?
That's a hell of a breakthrough, Jimes.
I'm proud of you.
Also, we just caught our man.
- He signed with his right hand.
- That's right, he did.
But he didn't do it.
- He did.
- What?
Couldn't help but notice you throwing those rolls with your left hand, boss.
Not mention, this hoodie matches our security footage exactly.
You stole that money when you came in to pick up your brother from holding today, didn't you?
- Damn it.
- Nice work, Peralta.
- So where's the money now?
- It's not here, all right?
I bet it all on the football game.
- My bookie has it.
- Yes!
The case continues.
- This is not good.
- Right.
Sorry, Jimes.
His father was murdered by a bookie.
I know you miss him.
Our perp says the bookie operates out of a hidden back room.
- Try to blend in.
- Good idea.
I'll just age myself 60 years, become Chinese and female.
Here we go.
Whoosh.
- Did it work?
- $10 to play.
- Oh, we're just looking around.
- $40 just to look around.
- All right, we'll play.
- $15 to play.
All right.
- Tommy, can we order some food?
- The cook's gone.
I sent him home.
- Do you have any more of these pretzels?
- Sure.
- I'm gonna call the cook.
- Smart.
Good call.
Hey, rough night?
Yeah, it certainly hasn't gone according to plan.
Aw, no.
Aw, Amy, I was ordering a drink called "A Rough Night".
It's tequila with a nicotine patch.
Right.
How do I get Holt to pay attention to me?
He sure spends a lot of time on Peralta.
Maybe I should start screwing up, like Jake does.
- I can act out too, you know?
- Please do.
Okay.
Watch this.
Oops.
Out All of you.
- But the cook is coming back.
- Out!
Fine!
But I'm taking these olives.
Sorry.
Happy Turkey Day.
I think I'm getting the hang of this.
These tiles are either game pieces or candy.
Game pieces.
Here we go.
I think I just won.
The guy by the bathroom seems very interested in the commotion you just made.
Yeah, and he's been waiting for the toilet since we got here.
Ten-to-one that's not a bathroom, and he's a lookout.
- Let's go.
- You got it.
Ahh, I'm gonna just cash out.
- There is nothing here.
- Don't worry, guys, I found food.
Are you eating packing peanuts?
Okay, I do keep a secret stash of food in the office.
I knew it!
Where?
Where?
- Sarge, am I too heavy?
- No.
Where is it?
- There, the one with the water stain.
- There's a lot of food up there?
Yeah, it's a smorgasbord.
- I think the rats got to it.
- You think?
This is the greatest thing that's ever happened.
Okay, it's over.
Now.
No, this will not be our Thanksgiving.
All right, you all wait here.
Give me an hour.
Terry, to the door.
I'm just gonna put you down, man.
Yeah, totally.
That makes sense.
That makes sense.
Hey, there.
Bathroom?
There's another one upstairs, over there.
Oh.
Never mind.
Let's go.
- What, it's really a bathroom?
- No, no, no.
There's tons of illegal stuff happening in there.
But they're watching the football game and I DVR'd it.
- I don't wanna see the score.
- What?
Okay, fine.
We'll go get the stolen money.
NYPD.
Freeze.
Change the channel and then freeze.
Put it down!
Put it down, put it down.
This is a weird request, but will you switch places with me?
I really don't wanna see the score.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.
That's so much better.
Oh!
Why are there so many TVs in here?
Thank you.
The money was still in the bookie's safe.
All the numbers match.
- Let's head back to Santiago's party.
- Ah, no thanks.
I think I'm gonna head home and watch the football game, which was ruined for me!
What's your problem with celebrating Thanksgiving?
It's a sucky holiday.
It's always sucked.
My mom worked.
My dad was gone.
And I sat at home, watching football.
Look, Jake.
I came from a very formal family.
My parents were not especially affectionate.
Really?
"Your Honor" wasn't a big snuggler?
But the beauty of being an adult is that you can make a new family with new traditions.
Well, that's nice, captain, but I don't have a new family yet, so I guess I'm stuck with my awesome old traditions.
Okay.
I'll tell the squad you couldn't make it.
Thank you.
Before you go, can I borrow some money?
I'm getting some pretty serious vibes from Wendy over there, and I'd like to take her someplace special.
Hey.
What are y'all doing here?
Amy broke everything and got us kicked out of the bar.
Then we got attacked by rats.
It's the best Thanksgiving ever.
Fascinating.
Happy Turkey Day.
Right through there, gentlemen.
Not a lot of places are open, so this will be a multiethnic, nontraditional Thanksgiving.
It's a real culinary challenge.
Give me 15 minutes, and then we feast.
Make it five.
You eat with your eyes, so the plating alone Five, Boyle!
- Captain?
- Hm?
I wanna tell you something.
I think you're Like, when I was a little girl You think I'm like when you were a little girl?
- Forget it.
The moment's passed.
- Is this about your toast?
- How'd you get that?
- Gina gave it to me.
It's very well-written.
There are several compelling anecdotes.
Good work.
I do feel, however, the word choice could've been improved in spots.
I marked them "Awk" for "Awkward".
That was the best thing anyone's ever said to me.
"I marked them 'Awk' for 'Awkward'"?
It's advice.
He's mentoring me.
Yes!
So this is kind of a play on your typical Thanksgiving dinner.
For turkey, we have the Peking duck with a veggie samosa stuffing.
The potatoes are the empanadas with an Ethiopian lentil stew gravy.
And for dessert, some seasonal gelatin cups.
Okay, I ran out of money.
They're from when Hitchcock got his colonoscopy.
Bon appÃ©tit.
I'm here, I'm here.
Finally something to actually be thankful for.
- What are you wearing?
- Santiago said to dress up, so Well, you look beautiful.
That's my thing now.
I'm just owning it.
Okay.
Before we eat - Nope, not doing that again.
Move.
- Could you pass the, uh You get that hand near me again, you're gonna lose it.
Okey-doke, let's eat.
Hey, thanks for giving a copy of my toast to Holt.
- That was nice of you.
- Oh, you're welcome.
I mean, you don't have to get so freaked out around him.
You were just trying to tell him you respect him.
Okay.
But, to be honest, I kinda gave it to him as a prank, 'cause I thought it would be super embarrassing for you.
But I'm happy it worked out.
But I would've been happy if you hated it.
But I'm happy you didn't.
So, you pretty much got the disaster night you were hoping for?
Yeah, till you made the best Thanksgiving meal I've ever had and ruined it.
Excuse me!
Uh, so, earlier at Amy's, I didn't give a real toast because I didn't know what to say.
But, since that time, a wise, unsmiling man named Gerald Jimes made me realize what I am thankful for.
So, I'd just like to say I'm happy to be here With my family.
My super-weird family, with two black dads and Two Latina daughters and two white sons and Gina, and I don't know what you are Some strange giant baby?
- To the Nine-Nine!
- To the Nine-Nine!
That was perfect.
Uh, Boyle cries!
I got Boyle Bingo!
- No - Yeah!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Al right, you'll take this one on the right, and I'll take the big one on the left.
NYPD!
Santa, stop hitting Santa.
What's going on here?
I've been on this corner for six years.
Suddenly, this guy shows up.
Hey, you don't own this corner.
I got a charity too.
Canine diabetes?
Who cares about fat dogs?
They can't give themselves shots, they got paws.
All right.
Calm down, calm down.
Boyle, frisk the skinny one.
I've gone 42 years without a lump of coal.
I'm not gonna start now.
Are you kidding me?
All right, fine.
Come here, buddy.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hit him in his fat cherry cheeks.
Ooh!
Ugh, that felt wrong.
Knife!
Skinny Santa's got a knife!
Ahh!
That's right.
Boom!
Just kicked Santa in the testicles.
Merry Christmas.
Looking good.
Happy Hanukkah.
You look happy.
Let me guess.
Your egg sandwich fell on the floor and they gave it to you for free.
No.
Can you do that?
Why doesn't everyone just drop their sandwiches on the floor?
I was trying to insult you.
And instead, you gave me an amazing life hack.
Oh, Amy, you shouldn't have.
But this is embarrassing.
I didn't get you a present.
The gift is for Captain Holt.
It's one of six presents I got him representing the six lessons that he's taught me: Determination, wisdom, posture Excuse me, everyone.
As you may know, this is the holiday season.
Detectives sometimes feel the urge to buy their captains holiday presents.
Please refrain from doing so.
Under no circumstances do I want a present.
Peralta, my office.
Roger that!
Oh, my God, I have to return so many items.
I know.
Shut up.
Thank you for joining us, Peralta.
This is deputy chief Gerber.
Ah, merry Christmas, chief.
And a very merry Christmas to you, Captain.
Ho, ho, ho!
Captain Holt has received a number of death threats.
Oh.
I really came in here with the wrong energy.
Captains receive meaningless threats all the time.
It's really no big deal.
Of course, totally.
I mean, why would a death threat be a big deal?
Oh, that's right.
'Cause it threatens death.
It's a hoax.
I didn't wanna alarm the squad.
So, please, keep this between us.
Awesome.
I'm great at secrets.
Santiago got you like six presents.
Well, it may be a hoax, but protocol dictates that Captain Holt have a security detail with him at all times.
He's chosen you for that detail.
Interesting.
And not at all surprising.
I'm his favorite.
Tell me, what would this job entail?
You'll be assigned to Captain Holt.
Uh-huh.
You'll be entirely in control of his movements.
Amazing.
He will not leave your sight.
You have the authority to make decisions that you feel are in the best interest of his safety.
Oh, my God.
Basically you'll be completely in charge.
Oh, well, it sounds really tough, but of course I accept, and I will be willing to put my life at risk for this man to have to follow all of my orders.
Thank you!
This is the best Christmas ever.
God bless us, everyone!
Hey, my flight is at 8:00 tonight.
It's domestic.
You think I'll be safe if I get to the airport five hours early?
Five?
No way!
You gotta do seven.
Seven minimum.
Seven.
I knew it.
Yep.
Why are you going on a singles cruise?
I thought you were into Rosa.
Well, I am.
But I've begun to feel like there's a slight chance Rosa may not love me back.
Hey, how about we grab some dinner tonight, just you and me?
That's nice, and I like you as a person, but I'm just not interested in you Romantically.
Coolio!
Hey, what say you we grab a drink?
You're starting to make this weird.
I'm not into you that way, and I have a boyfriend.
Got you.
Rain check.
A rose for Rosa.
Listen to me!
The healthy thing for you to do is move on.
So we both decided the healthy thing for me to do is to just move on.
I'm impressed, Charles.
That's very mature.
Thanks.
You know what's funny?
I realized I sometimes Oh, no, don't get comfy.
This wasn't an invitation to keep talking.
Gotcha.
Rain check on the convo.
Yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.
Peralta's busy, so let's just get started.
Now, the Captain won't allow us to give him all the presents we bought him.
You are the only one that did that.
But we can make him the greatest Christmas card of all time.
We're gonna Santa hats and big sweaters and take a picture of us all in a lineup.
I'm sorry, Santiago, but I don't have time for that.
My psych evaluation is today.
They're gonna decide if I'm ready to make it back on the streets.
Why do you care what they think?
Psychologists are just people who weren't smart enough to be psychics.
Don't worry, sergeant.
We'll add you in later.
Sorry, I gotta go too.
My flight is in Ah, eight hours.
I can make it.
I'll buy a sandwich on the plane.
Boyle!
So if Peralta, Boyle, and the sergeant are out Fine, everyone just go.
Yeah.
I could take a pic of myself dressed up as an elf.
Elfie-selfie.
Not that But I think there is something you could help me with.
You gonna sit there all day?
Affirmative, stone eagle.
That's the Secret Service codename I gave you.
Just sitting here doing my job, watching, protecting, bossing you around.
Now, for your safety, if you could open up your Internet browser and search the words "pigs" and "jet skis," and that's an order.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where you going, Cold Mountain?
I changed your codename.
To use the restroom.
I'm only asking this for your safety.
Is it a number one or a number two?
Your silence indicates number two.
Let me do some recon.
It's all clear, sir.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Cold Mountain is on the move.
I repeat, Cold Mountain is rolling to the can.
Sergeant Jeffords, thank you for coming in today.
We are here to assess your readiness for active duty, and if all goes I will stamp this release form, you can go back in the field.
Well, I think I'm ready.
I am no longer fixating on my fears, ha.
Good.
But for today, let's fixate on those fears.
Okay.
Um That sounds fun.
Let's begin by talking about your baby girls and your wife, and what would happen to them if you died In the line of duty.
I popped your pillow.
Captain Where do you think you're going?
I'm going home to work in peace.
That's a negative, ice veins.
Changed your codename again.
Do you know why I chose you to be my security escort?
Because I'm a modern-day Sherlock Holmes?
No, I chose you because the threat is not real.
Mm-hmm.
And I thought you'd have no problem breaking the rules and letting me get my work done.
Now let me go.
Well, you thought wrong.
You can't go home.
It's protocol.
But if you really wanna get outta here, you can come to my mom's.
She lives nearby.
Or I can lock you up in the holding cell with an armed escort.
Totally your call.
Fine.
We will go to your mother's house.
I guess I am curious to see where This all started.
Shotgun.
So this is my mom's place.
You can just throw your jacket in the closet.
That's a bathroom.
Water closet.
My mom's British.
Hmm.
Why are there no photographs of you?
No holiday decorations.
Nothing but Motel art.
This isn't your mom's apartment.
It's a safe house, son!
You've been protected.
Don't say "son".
Get outta my way.
Look, you wouldn't stay at your desk and you evaded your protection detail.
I'm sorry, but I've gotta order you to stay.
I love giving you orders.
The only way you're gonna keep me here is if you physically stop me.
Can you do that, Peralta?
I didn't think so.
Jordan.
Ahh!
Oh, no.
We're handcuffed together and we've lost the key.
Falconer one to HQ, stone eagle is in the cage.
I repeat, stone eagle is in the cage.
I told you the death threat was not serious.
So what on earth are you doing?
Look, I know you think that I'm just goofing around, but I got a direct order from your boss to protect you.
So from this point forward, we're on lockdown.
Fine.
But before we go into lockdown Too late.
You're on it.
I'd like to text my husband and tell him I'll be coming home late tonight.
All right, but for security reasons, I get to craft the message.
Let's start with a pleasant greeting.
How about "Hello, honey".
You will not craft the message.
Okay, Roger that.
"Honey's" wrong.
How about "hello, husband"?
How about "hello, sir"?
You call each other "sir"?
Give me my phone.
Fine.
I'll give you some privacy.
Maybe put Hitchcock's head on top like an angel.
Mm.
Like that?
No, put it behind the tree.
Thanks for helping me make this card.
You're so good at this stuff.
I know.
I'm good at everything.
All right, so here's all the pictures of Rosa that we have.
Which one should we use?
She never smiles.
Is her mouth broken?
Well, what about if we Flip those lips?
Oh, God.
Oof!
That's horrifying.
We have to get a picture of Rosa smiling.
Holt's card has to be perfect.
Guys I got this.
I can make Rosa smile.
Just keep your cameras ready.
Making coffee?
Can you make another cup for senor tickle and his nueve amigos?
Tickle, tickle, tickle!
What the hell, Hitchcock?
Ow, ahh!
Ow, ow, ow!
I think you sprained senor tickle.
Next time, I break it off.
Ow!
All right.
My safe house, my rules.
This is a no tie zone.
A hungry safe house is an unsafe safe house.
A fun safe house is a safe safe house.
My serve.
Ah.
I thought you said you've never played this.
It's very intuitive.
Let's have another sandwich.
A safe house- watching safe house is a safe safe house house.
I've already seen the film.
I enjoyed it.
Wow, I would not have guessed that.
You see, those are the kind of things that you learn when you're handcuffed together.
And that is the true meaning of Christmas.
Who knows we're here?
Get behind me.
No, no!
Going over!
Standard protocol suggests that you put me in another room before you open the door.
But since you've cuffed us together I order you to be quiet.
Come on.
Freeze, sicko!
Ah!
Jake, it's me, Charles from work.
Okay, let's switch gears, do a little word association.
What do you think of when I say the word "bottle"?
Liquor store, holdup, gun, die.
How about "grass"?
Marijuana, drugs.
Gun, die.
Cat.
Kitten.
Cute.
Calm.
False sense of security.
Gun, die.
What are you doing?
You gonna stamp my form?
No.
I just didn't want the ink to dry out.
Boyle, what are you doing here?
I thought you had to catch a flight.
I do.
My flight is in six hours.
But the Captain texted me to come, so I'm here.
What?
You texted Boyle when you told me you were texting your husband?
As the person who's completely in charge here, I am very disappointed in you.
I'm changing your codename to "bad boy".
Oh, I can't imagine what it's like to be disappointed at someone under your command.
Okay, I see what you're doing.
Tushy.
It's touche.
Well, I'm in charge, and I say it's tushy.
Boyle?
I've heard it both ways.
Please don't involve me in this.
I'm just here to uncuff the Captain and take him to his old precinct.
What?
Old precinct?
Wait a minute.
You weren't going home at all.
You were going to investigate the threat because it's not a hoax, it's real!
Wrong, it's not real.
You're lying!
You have a tell.
When you lie, the corner of your mouth moves, and it just moved.
Wrong, it's not real.
You're lying!
Fine.
I believe the threat is real, though I'm not sure who's behind it.
But this is my problem, and I'm gonna solve it on my own.
Boyle, uncuff me.
Don't do it, Charles.
I'll take you on that trip to the botanical gardens we've always talked about.
Uncuff me, and that's a direct order.
Don't do it, best friend.
Botanical gardens.
Ah!
This is just like Christmas at my parents' house.
Why do they have separate dining rooms?
I No!
That was not one of the options!
I couldn't choose, I love you both so much.
Who wants to watch safe house?
So, including letters, e-mails, and texts from a blocked phone, we have received ten threats.
How many people have you put away that might want you dead?
I've arrested over 600 people.
Brag.
Boyle, will you please read the transcripts of the threats he's received?
Yup.
"Die, die, die".
"Die, Holt, die".
Okay, a little obvious.
"You will drown in your own blood".
Better.
Although I would've gone with the whole, "I'm gonna staple my face onto your face" thing.
Human skin mask.
Classic.
The next one is "I'm gonna send you off the deep end".
"Drowning" and "deep end".
Almost sounds like he's talking about a swimming pool.
It's Haimes.
Aha!
Who's Haimes?
Colin Haimes, the freestyle killer.
He took out an entire 4x100 meter relay swim team in 1982.
Marco.
Now you say "polo," punk.
The freestyle killer.
Man!
How come all the killers you've caught had such cool names?
The best name I ever brought in was "narrow shoes" Sam, because his shoes were narrow and his name was Sam.
I get it.
Yeah, you get it.
Well, Captain, it looks like you needed our help after all.
Together, we figured out it was Haimes, and together, we're gonna take him down.
Because together, we can do anything.
Here we go!
I'm finding Haimes alone.
Coming back at you, Jake!
Oh, my God, Rosa!
I accidentally opened your mail, but look what it says.
"Dear miss Diaz, you just won" Rosa, guess what.
I accidentally opened your mail, and here's what it says.
"Dear miss Diaz, you just won" No, I'm reading the letter, and you're taking the picture.
What?
Ha!
You were trying to get me to smile for your dumb picture, but you messed up.
Ah!
She smiled.
She's smiling!
And no one has a camera.
Got it, Amy.
Got a picture of you frowning.
That's what you wanted, right?
Peralta, for the last time we don't have to go back to the precinct.
I don't need everyone's help.
Look, Captain, you're stubborn.
And that's an adorable quality.
You wanna know what's not an adorable quality?
Being dead.
Acne.
Yep, being dead.
I mean, I give up.
What's going on with you?
Why are you being so weird about this?
I don't need your help.
I don't wanna involve you, or Boyle, or anyone.
Because I brought this situation on myself.
No one should get hurt because of a dumb mistake I made as a brash, young Detective.
Hey, Haimes.
You're gonna spend the rest of your life in a little cement room, doing nothing.
And while you're in there, I'm gonna go for a swim.
And after that swim, I might take another swim.
And you'll just be sitting there on your metal toilet, thinking of me swim, swim, swimming all day long.
When I get out of lockup, I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you.
Yeah.
Right.
Wow.
I think I really would've gotten along with young Ray Holt.
Yes, that's why I decided to change everything about my life.
Well, frankly, sir, you're still acting like that brash, dumb Detective.
If you had truly changed, you'd be saying a bunch of boring, responsible stuff, like "Don't be stupid.
"Use the Detective squad.
You're part of a team.
I smell like sandalwood".
That's what it is!
Yet another terrible impression, Peralta.
But I think you're right.
Wait, what?
Sir, I'm sure you had your reasons for going to Peralta, but This is exactly the type of job I would love to have.
Okay, the next time someone threatens to kill me, I'll come straight to you.
Thank you, sir.
I can't wait.
I didn't mean Let's catch this bastard.
All right, let's go!
Updates.
Santiago.
Looking into Haimes' associates.
Nothing yet.
Boyle?
Uh, some intel coming in from ossining.
Haimes was released two weeks ago.
Good.
Hitchcock and Scully, update on your secret project?
Hazelnut coffee'll be up in five minutes.
Sumatran's ready to go.
Keep me updated.
Warrant for the phone trace came through.
We got Haimes' number And the last coordinates from its GPS.
The rail yards.
All right, we got him.
Everyone suit up!
I know there's no point in telling you not to come, but while we're out there, you're sticking with me.
Oh.
Goodie.
Man, you really know how to take the fun out of saving your life.
You heard him, Hitchcock.
Get that Sumatran in the thermos.
I'm on it.
If things go south, I just want you to know it's been an honor being able to boss you around.
Anything else?
Yes.
What cute little nickname do you call your husband?
Kevin.
Adorable.
Sorry you missed your flight.
I have a backup flight in four hours.
Gotta flush him out.
We got his number now.
Call his phone.
Smart.
It's ringing.
This is exciting.
That is Haimes' phone.
I repeat, everyone converge on that ringtone.
He's heading north on track 17!
Hey.
When this is all over, we should take a train trip together.
Just for fun.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Ray Holt!
Hello, Haimes.
Thought about you every day I was in jail just like you said.
I thought about pointing a gun at you and pulling the trigger.
Kinda like this.
Noooo!
Terry's back!
Terry's back!
We got him.
Nice work, Jeffords.
Nice work, Peralta.
Captain, you're doing it.
You're emoting.
I need an ambulance.
Boyle's down.
Ah, what happened?
Am I dead?
You saved my life.
Die, pig!
Don't!
Ahhh!
Oh, my butt!
Oh, my butt.
He's gonna be fine.
You can see him in a minute.
Thank you.
Sarge, I'm so glad that shrink cleared you.
Mm, more or less.
And time's up.
Show me how Terry sees Terry.
Oh, no.
Yeah, it's pretty bad.
Sergeant!
Excuse me, we are Yeah, can it, quack.
Captain Holt needs your help.
His life is in danger.
Oh, sergeant I do not think that you're ready.
I'm ready.
Mm-kay, bye!
I owe you one.
Boyle got shot because of me.
This is exactly the kind of thing I was hoping to avoid.
Captain, this is our job.
Any one of us would've taken that bullet.
I'm sorry I've been so difficult.
You were right.
We couldn't have caught him without the team.
Well, well, well.
It appears the student has become the teacher.
And the teacher hath become That's enough.
Okay.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Team pop and lock.
Here we go!
Whoosh!
Come on, still?
We saved your life!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
It's happening!
Whoa, whoa!
Yes!
We did it!
Excuse me!
This is a hospital.
Right.
Sorry.
People are dying.
You know, everyone should just go home and enjoy their Christmas.
You don't need to stick around here for me.
Shut up, no one's going anywhere.
What you did was amazing.
Yeah, Boyle, that was some superman stuff.
Yeah, you did the nine-nine proud.
No ifs, ands, or butts.
Sorry, it's just right there.
Literally.
It's just right in front of me.
His butt is right in my face.
I have to tell you guys something.
Even though I got shot In the butt.
Sorry.
I'd rather be here, spending Christmas with all of you, than on some stupid singles cruise.
And I mean that, from the bottom of my Butt.
Again, sorry.
Ow!
Shut up, Jake!
Boyle's a hero.
And so is his butt.
I got it!
She smiled!
Christmas card complete.
He got shot in the butt.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
He's here.
Boyle is here.
This is so fun!
I wish you guys got shot more often.
Buh-buh-buh-back in the nine nine.
Welcome back, Detective.
Wow, is this all for me?
Of course it is.
What're you wearing, there, buddy?
Oh, none of my pants fit over my butt cast.
Lucky for me my lent me her leg warmers.
That is lucky.
Pretty sweet scooter.
Yeah, I know.
Check out these doughnuts.
Whoo-hoo!
Oh, that went terribly.
Can I help you with something?
Nope, nope.
Everything's under control.
I picked up a couple reacher grabbers.
Yeah.
So I'm able to do everything that I used to do.
So now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go make myself a morning cup of coffee like I do every day.
Okay, okay.
Just gotta No problem.
Oh The heart is the hardest part.
Let me get that for you, Boyle.
No need.
No need at all.
That's sweet, Rosa.
Here we go.
Ah Hey, Charles, just take my coffee.
It's fresh.
Okay, I guess.
I mean, if you don't mind.
All right, you got it?
Ah No problem.
Why wouldn't you just use your other hand?
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Hot coffee in my cast!
Ah!
Ah Cold milk.
Cold milk.
That's coming out the bottom.
It is coming out the bottom of my cast.
All right.
Hey.
What's going on?
Just picked him up on a dozen counts of identity theft.
His name is Doug Judy.
You ever seen him before?
No.
Rosa Rosa, Rosa Oh, yeah Beautiful Rosa I think he's into me.
What do you do to these perps?
Fear is a powerful aphrodisiac.
Anyway, he said he wants to speak to "John or Jack Peralta or whatever".
What does he want with me?
And should I change my name to Jack Peralta?
That sounds badass.
Jack Peralta, crocodile hunter.
Yeah.
He said he wants a deal.
He has some information about some dude who steals Pontiacs.
Pontiacs?
He knows about the Pontiac bandit.
Listen to me, he specifically said he knows a guy who steals Pontiacs?
Yeah, I just said that.
Chill, man.
Okay.
Okay, sorry.
M'kay.
Hey, Diaz.
Come here and talk to me.
This dude is super horny.
Yeah.
Ah.
Whoa.
Backing up, guys.
Oh, are you?
Huh.
Please get out of my way.
I am physically disabled.
One of these buttons Sorry, sorry.
Oh, you don't have to apologize for anything, Boyle.
You were shot in the line of duty, defending a fellow officer.
You know, the doctor said that if the bullet was two millimeters to the left and a foot higher, I might never have walked again.
Everyone here appreciates your heroism, Boyle.
We all want your first day back to be as pleasant and as comfortable as possible.
Right, detectives?
Absolutely.
Hey, Boyle.
You want to choose where we order lunch from today?
Really?
You're lifting the lifetime ban?
I thought my lunch choices were "horrifying adventures in diarrhea".
Today, Charles, we take that adventure with you.
All right!
I've been craving Sudanese all day.
I'll print out some menus.
Ouch.
You ran over my foot.
I am in incredible pain.
I used to work at a chop shop.
It was chill.
Decent hours, good benefits.
You could work while you were High.
Which I never did, 'cause that's irresponsible.
Anyway, we did a lot of work for this dude who stole Pontiacs.
The Pontiac bandit!
Okay.
We called him bill, but whatever.
No, not whatever.
The Pontiac bandit is my Nemesis.
I've been chasing this guy for eight years.
He's stolen hundreds of cars, all of them Pontiacs.
He's never left any evidence, and he's never been caught on Cam the guy is a ghost.
Super ghost.
He's a super ghost!
Before we go any further, we need to know if you're for real.
Describe the guy.
Asian dude.
Maybe 5'8", spiky black hair.
Rocks in both ears.
Always wears a black suit.
And speaks with a British accent.
Like my girl Dame Judi Dench.
I have impeccable taste.
So would you say he looks sort of like This?
That's bill.
This is a composite sketch from ten interviews I've done.
Perfect match.
So all you know is what a bunch of other mopes have said over the years.
Anything else?
Yeah.
I know how to get in touch with him.
Doug Judy!
You wanted to see me, Captain?
My husband's dog cheddar had relations with our neighbor dog karate and produced these two smaller dogs he insisted that I find them a good home with someone we trust.
You can trust me.
Dogs are my whole life.
Also work.
Doing work and hanging with dogs.
That's my lifestyle.
You're allergic to dogs, aren't you?
Nope.
I just need an epipen because my happiness is making my throat close up.
Hand me the small dog, Santiago.
So the burner phone that Doug Judy used to contact the Pontiac bandit is at his mom's house.
He's agreed to help us catch the bandit if we drop all charges against him.
How many cars would you say this Pontiac bandit has stolen?
But the real number could be in the millions.
You're not very good at math.
What are the charges against Judy?
but I've been chasing him for a month.
Oh, a month?
I've been trying to catch the Pontiac bandit for eight years.
You know how many months that is?
years, months.
Do you need a math tutor?
Because the department will provide one for you.
I can't tell if you're being serious.
I'm on the fence here.
Diaz caught him.
It's your call.
Look, this guy is for real.
Yes.
Okay.
I'm in.
What's 1,000 push-ups?
Oh, we were in the academy together, and we hated all the drills, so now when we're on a case and one of us says 1,000 push-ups, it means I'm so sure I'm right that if I'm wrong, I'll do 1,000 push-ups.
It's a pact we made.
It really just means "trust me".
And I do.
Okay.
Make the deal.
Yes!
I've got you now, Pontiac bandit.
Whoo!
Feels good to finally say that in front of actual people instead of just the mirror.
All right, so we grab the burner, catch the bandit, become police legends.
My mom's car is here.
She's home.
Can I take these cuffs off?
No way.
She doesn't know I'm a criminal.
She thinks I own an architecture firm with all white employees.
That's racist.
Why stop there?
Why not tell her you're an astronaut?
'Cause space is scary.
You saw what it did to Sandy bullock.
Yeah, I'm with him on this one.
I'll stay on earth, thank you very much.
Yeah.
Come on, Rosa.
We can play-act with his mom for two minutes to get a lead.
Fine.
One false move, and I tase you in front of your mom.
Dougie!
Oh, my beautiful boy.
Well, shouldn't you be at work?
Never too busy to see my mama.
Oh.
Mama, this is my girlfriend Rosa.
And this is my personal assistant.
Mangy Carl.
Aw, it's nice to meet you.
You can just call me Carl.
Mangy Carl used to be a homeless gentleman.
I work with a charity that finds jobs for down-on-their-luck white people.
Oh He's just a big, old angel.
He's been so good to The whites.
Yes, he is.
Yeah.
This guy.
Aw Hey, speaking of which, we should probably grab that phone, you know, so you can get back to architecturals.
Yes, it's in the spare bedroom.
I'll go with you.
It's a mess.
Actually, we can handle it on our own, ma'am.
Thank you so much.
Why don't you just stay up here and Chop it up with Rosa?
Well, that sounds nice.
We can get to know each other a little.
I love getting to know people.
It's my jam.
Oh, how good is this food?
I'm eating it.
They accidentally put a stone in mine.
Oh, no, no, no, no, that's the hoof!
That's the best part of the stew!
Oh, man.
Think of it as marrow nugget wrapped in a thick toenail.
Mmm.
Hey, did I tell you guys what the doctor said?
Mm-hmm.
Couple times.
But we'd love to hear it again.
He said that if the bullet was a fraction of an inch to the left and two feet up, it woulda hit my brain.
Oh Yeah.
Oh "Back in the game.
When can we meet"?
Damn, you're a good assistant.
I could get used to this.
How long till he usually gets back to you?
Like ten minutes.
Chill, mangy.
I can't chill.
I've never been this close before.
I gotta admit, your enthusiasm makes me want you to catch him.
Thank you.
Are these laserdiscs?
Yeah, I robbed a tower records back in '92.
Kept my faves.
Doug Judy.
Ooh.
Blade runner, tron, oh!
Fievel goes west?
Yes, sir.
Love that little mouse.
His journey The story of America.
I could not agree more.
Fievel?
Papa.
Fievel!
Papa!
Fie-vel!
Pa-pa!
Fie-vel!
You guys having fun?
Hey.
'Cause I'm not.
His mom put this stupid braid in my hair.
Oh, looks beautiful.
Yeah, it's kinda cute.
Please have my children.
It's him.
Parking lot on Flatbush and Vanderbilt in 15 minutes.
Let's go.
Wait, wait, wait.
Diaz looks like a dirty criminal.
But you look like a cop, man.
You can't go over there like that.
What'd you have in mind?
Don't call it a comeback I been here for years Rockin' my peers and puttin' suckas in fear Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon Listen to the bass go boom Explosion overpowerin' Over the competition I'm towerin' I don't look like a cop now.
No, you look like a Boyz II Men Easter album.
Burn.
That's not a burn, that's cool.
Gina, we've been looking all over for you.
You can't just disappear and leave a sign on your desk that says, "gone leavin'".
I'm hiding from Charles.
I can't take him anymore.
It's safe in here 'cause his scooter can't get up the steps in the hallway.
Gina, have some compassion.
Boyle got hurt doing something brave.
You didn't have to do physical therapy with him, Amy.
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, push.
Pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal, push.
All this cycling makes me feel like Lance Armstrong.
Like you use performance-enhancing drugs and have one teste?
Wouldn't you like to know?
How long can you possibly hide in here?
I sent all the Captain's calls here, my phone battery's at 100% charge, and I have ten loose diner mints in my purse.
This is my home now.
I gotta say, the suit is growing on me.
Looks good.
Is it triple-breasted somehow?
There's no such thing.
What about the girl in total recall?
Mmm.
Triple bitties.
Triple bitties.
Triple bitties.
Yeah.
Rosa There's no sign of anyone.
You sure about this?
Okay.
Heads up.
Who the hell are you?
Where's bill?
He hadn't heard from you in a while, so he sent me to make sure everything was cool.
Apparently it's not.
Who are they?
They're with me.
This is the buyer.
Carl Mangerman.
'Sup?
I don't know them, I don't trust them.
He meets with you alone or it's off.
I'll text the address.
Come on!
I promise you this.
They have not heard the last of Carl mangerman.
Sergeant, I'd like you to meet Richard and Dan.
They are puppies.
Very cute, sir.
Maybe your twins would like some little, furry friends.
I'm sorry, sir, but that's impossible.
With the twins learning how to walk, chaos reigns at the Jeffords household.
I can't let those innocent pups into that madhouse.
Terry won't do you like that.
I understand.
Just know you have disappointed All three of us.
That's cold, sir.
All right, it's worth the risk.
We send him in alone.
No, we do not.
Something doesn't smell right to me.
Could be my dad's suit.
He died in it.
He died in it?
Oh, man.
They just sent the location.
Man, this dude is cautious.
If I show up one minute late or I'm not alone, he's done with me.
This is your last shot.
I can't let the Pontiac bandit get away.
Put a wire on him, get a tactical team in as backup.
It's the only way.
Doug Judy and I know this guy.
You have to trust us.
Do I?
One of you is a criminal, and the other one is dressed like Steve Harvey.
It's over.
I'm ending this now.
Sorry, Jake.
Seriously?
Yeah.
1,000 push-ups.
Well, I raise you.
What?
That's not how this works.
I said 1,000 push-ups, you have to back me up.
That's the pact, end of story.
Well, I break the pact.
I hope you understand how serious this is to me.
Come on, Rosa.
Can't you read between the lines, man?
Don't quote die hard.
Sorry.
But we're still sending him in alone.
We need evidence, so get him talking.
Ask questions about money, cars, specifics.
I'm getting kind of nervous, man.
This dude is for real.
You sure you got everything covered?
Yeah.
There's a body on the back door, eyes on the side door, and two guys out on the corner.
You're gonna be fine.
What about choppers?
You got choppers?
With snipers and rockets?
No one has rocket choppers.
Although that does sound amazing.
So, what'd I miss?
Tell me all the jokes.
Everything funny that happened.
Charles, we really need to get back to Hitchcock called himself Scully by accident.
I did.
But it brought me and Scully closer together.
That's great!
What else?
Oh Oh, I laughed too hard.
Lost another highlighter.
Does anyone have skinny forearms?
Fine.
Great.
Yeah, it's way down there by my butt.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
Is that it?
Yup.
Oh, okay.
Right there.
Ah!
Got it.
Oh, my God.
Where's my grandmother's ring?
Oop.
Found it.
I'll be right back.
Please get out of my way.
I am physically disabled.
Please get out of my way.
Welcome to the Boyle-free zone.
Please turn off all cell phones so as not to attract any unwanted attention.
Can I offer you a mint?
We got eyes on the bandit.
He's a block away.
You ready?
You and me, Jakey.
We were born ready.
Go, Judy, go.
We meet at last, Pontiac bandit.
For eight years I've tracked you.
And today I'm taking you down.
Doug Judy, can you hear me?
Say something to test the wire.
Hey, Diaz After we put the cuffs on this guy, I'll be free for dinner.
You like spaghetti?
And weed?
The mic works.
My man.
What's up?
Pleasure to see you again.
Let's talk about cars.
I got my shop up and running again.
I can do anything you want.
Blue cars, red cars, big cars, small cars, you know, cars.
Cars are really great, aren't they?
What is he doing?
Talking about cars.
Boyle, where is everyone?
Hiding from me in the evidence room.
They think I don't know, but Gina's been live tweeting the whole thing.
She live tweets everything.
Ruined Downton Abbey for me.
Maybe it was too soon for me to come back.
I would've just stayed at home, but I was getting lonely and bored.
One day I looked out the window for four hours.
I didn't see anything.
Huh.
You know what else is great about cars?
The way they look.
How they stop, how they start.
That's it.
I'm calling it.
No!
Move, people, we're going in now.
On your knees!
Hands on your head!
Gotcha, Pontiac bandit.
Where's Doug Judy?
He went to the bathroom.
I'm just here to give him a haircut.
I don't know what's going on.
A likely story, Pontiac But actually you do have a lot of hair products.
He's gone.
He ran.
Why would he do that?
He helped us catch the Pontiac bandit.
That was the deal.
Doesn't make any sense unless Doug Judy is the Pontiac bandit.
Put out an APB.
Seal off everything for a 20-block radius.
Yeah, don't bother looking for me.
I'm in the wind.
If you're close enough for me to hear you, you're close enough for me to catch you.
Nah, I got a relay set up, brother.
So if you're the Pontiac bandit, who's this joker?
Couple of years ago you were getting really close, so I started telling all my associates if they ever get caught, they should describe me as Asian dude, 5'8", spiky hair.
Wears diamond earrings and has a British accent.
So then you hired a guy who matched that exact description.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's my barber Norman Lee.
He gave me the idea.
You know, if you can't come in, I do house calls.
You just text me a location and I could be there in half an hour.
Good to know.
You know, you should actually use him while he's there.
He'll give you a dope fade.
I get dope enough fades from my current barber, thank you.
So you dragged us over here, went in there, pretended to talk, and then snuck out the basement.
Am I right?
The basement connected to another basement!
Which connected to a garage, which is where my boy picked me up.
Your boy?
Oh, that guy from the meet-up.
He works for you.
He pretended to be spooked by me and Diaz in the parking lot to make sure that we let you go to the next meeting by yourself.
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
You win a Teddy bear!
You lied to me, Doug Judy.
Gotta be honest, I'm pretty disappointed right now.
I mean, was that even really your mom?
Hell yeah, that's my real mom.
I wanted to see her one last time before I disappeared.
I told you I was sensitive, Rosa.
Yeah, you did.
Why don't you come back here and take me out to dinner?
Ah I know you're trying to trap me.
But crazy thing is I'm tempted!
That's how hot I find you.
Sorry it had to go down this way, Peralta.
Maybe we could've been friends in another world.
If I hadn't just fooled you like a little bitch!
Bitch!
'Kay.
Hey, Captain, we thought we'd get more work done in here, because You're all hiding from Boyle.
Not me, Captain.
I was napping.
That's worse.
Captain, we all think Boyle's a hero, but it's very difficult to be around him right now.
I was in the bathroom with him, sir.
It was a nightmare.
Hey, sarge, this cast has a special crotch hole.
It's like a doggy door for my penis.
Shake.
That man took a bullet for this precinct.
He's a guy who's always looking for love and friendship.
And he needs it now more than ever.
But you all turned your backs on him.
And you should all be ashamed of yourselves.
I'm sorry.
Those puppies are so cute.
They do undercut your Tone a bit, sir.
But on the plus side, I think I know what to do with them.
Detective Boyle.
I think you might be able to give these dogs a good home.
Ah You are off the scooter.
If you have fallen, please call a doctor.
Oh, Captain I don't know if I should okay.
Oh That tickles.
They like me so much!
Are you crying, Santiago?
I'm so allergic.
Can you tell the scooter to call an ambulance?
Hey.
So I went back to the mom's house.
Unsurprisingly a dead end.
I got a lot of work to do, Peralta.
Wait.
I want to say something.
We've worked together long enough that I know how much you hate apologies.
I just want to ask you to join the Doug Judy case.
Officially, as partners.
I want to catch this guy, and I can't do it without you.
No, you can't.
Now I bee I owe you I don't care about the push-ups, Jake.
I care that you didn't honor our pact.
I've always trusted you, and when you did that it made me feel like you don't trust me.
I know, and I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
No, it won't.
Now get down on the floor.
What?
You just said you didn't care about the push-ups.
I changed my mind.
Fair enough.
A pact's a pact.
One, two, three Night, Peralta.
Night.
Hey, Ronald.
Is so many push-ups.
I'm never gonna make it.
What am I at?
Thank you, Captain.
You said 2,000, remember?
Agh!
I shoulda trusted you!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Charles, this is exciting.
- Medal of valor.
- I know.
For getting shot in the butt.
Oh, my butt!
For exceptional acts of heroism or voluntary risk of personal safety.
But, you know, six of one.
This is one of the NYPD's highest honors.
Today is your day, Detective Boyle.
Heroism can't be measured by a piece of metal.
But what else can we do to recognize the brave officers that have put their lives on the line?
It is my great honor to present the medal of valor to Detective Charles Boyle And sergeant peanut butter.
Oh, my God.
Charles is getting the same medal as a horse.
At least Boyle was announced first.
Because the horse outranks him.
This is amazing.
That's enough, Peralta.
This is a huge honor, and nothing can take that away from him.
The horse is pooping on the stage.
Sergeant peanut butter is pooping on the stage.
Peralta.
Santiago.
The bet ends today.
Are you ready?
I was born ready.
To lose?
The whole question was, "are you ready to lose"?
And you said you were born that way.
Twist my words all you want.
Okay.
I'm winning this bet.
- No.
- What bet?
What are you guys talking about?
Seriously?
The bet?
They've been keeping score all year.
It comes up all the time.
What are you doing all day?
Nothing.
Why, you wanna hang out?
A year ago today, Peralta and I made a bet to prove who's a better Detective.
Whoever makes more felony arrests, wins.
What are the stakes?
And don't say money, because I know you're in debt.
If you really knew anything about me, you would've said "crushing debt," and I'll bet whatever, 'cause there's no way I'm losing.
What about your car?
Oh!
That thing is a date magnet.
I mean, how many girls have you made out with in that car?
Six?
Well, I'm gonna win, so sure.
Let's bet the car.
Yes.
No, Jakey, no!
That car is your superpower.
Thor would never wager his hammer.
Neil Patrick Harris would never wager his showmanship.
Losing that car will be the worst thing in the world for you.
Well, what's the worst thing in the world for you, Santiago?
Being one of those girls in Jake's car.
Okay, okay, okay.
Then it is settled.
If Peralta loses, Santiago gets his car.
If Santiago loses, she goes for a date in said car.
Game on.
Game on.
Wow, your handshake is quite firm.
I took a seminar.
Where?
And the score is all tied up.
But not for long.
For in eight hours, I will win the bet and take Santiago on the worst date in the history of the world.
Attention.
After today's shift, I'd like everyone join me at the bar for drinks in honor of Detective Boyle and his medal of valor.
Oh, my God, is peanut butter gonna be there?
That horse is a damn hero.
Peanut butter will not be joining us.
He's being feted by the united nations.
As you were.
Pen.
You ow!
Rolly chair!
Gina's desk!
Oh, Jake.
No!
Captain, hey.
You're looking stoic today, like a wise old oak.
I'm not gonna give you more cases so you can win your bet with Santiago.
What?
Oh, right, the bet.
Totally forgot about that.
Well, granted, this friendly competition has led to you and Santiago putting in more hours and arresting more perps, especially this last week.
Up by one, Peralta.
Anything you want to say to your car before you never see it again?
Hmm?
Hey, Santiago, do you have any dietary restrictions that medieval times should know about?
Yes, 3-1-1?
What's the safest way to set a car on fire?
Ooh.
Hmm!
Both of you have done exemplary work, which I appreciate.
And I can see that by the absolutely no indicators on your face.
However, you are colleagues, and the fallout from this bet has the potential to put a strain on your professional relationship.
Only if I lose.
I'm a terrible sport.
Cases will be assigned as they usually are.
Dismissed.
Captain, you look No.
Rosa, hey, would you like to share a cup of coffee with me?
I got some gorgeous new coffee beans.
Sure, that sounds great.
Isn't that, like, your fifth cup of coffee today?
I'm trying to counteract the drowsiness from my pain meds.
I took a double dose after the incident at the ceremony.
Bring peanut butter forward forward.
Uh, can the little guy take a big step back, please?
My name is Charles Boyle.
I won the same medal as this horse.
The footage from my fall led the local news, so who's the hero now, peanut butter?
Peanut butter.
Gina, you're just trying to hurt me to distract yourself from your own internal pain.
Also, you should use less conditioner, because this is a flat mess.
What's going on with Boyle?
His pain meds are making him weird.
Oh, okay.
Yes.
This happened to my dad when he got his vasectomy un-reversed.
You get all relaxed and you have no filter and you just start dropping truth bombs on everyone.
Oh, that explains the elevator.
I'm worried you don't find me interesting.
I'm gonna pretend someone texted me.
Bloop.
Gina, please keep an eye on Boyle today.
He's gonna say something to the wrong person and get himself punched.
Sure, I'd love to see Charles get punched.
Try again?
I will stop Charles from getting punched.
Correct.
Great.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present Carl Laudson, who stole $3,000.
Santiago takes the lead with one minute left.
Suck it, Peralta.
Oh, no.
That's right, "oh, no".
Oh, no.
You don't seem worried.
Why aren't you worried?
Bring in the Johns.
I ran a prostitution sting through vice and arrested 30 guys for soliciting.
That's not a felony.
It is when it's your second offense, which is the case for ten of these gentlemen.
Four of them are actually named John.
Ironic.
Anyhoo, ten more for Peralta.
Accept your fate.
Never.
Five, four, three, two, one.
No.
Jake wins, Amy loses.
Celebrate good times come on!
Let's celebrate Look!
Celebrate good times, come on!
Whoo!
Amy Santiago, you have made me the happiest man on earth.
I spent $1 on this ring.
Will you go on the worst date ever with me?
You have to say yes.
Yes.
She said yes!
She said yes.
This is for you.
Amy Santiago, date time.
Time to date.
Peralta, this outfit is ridiculous.
Chop chop.
There's plenty of embarrassing to do and only a few hours to do it in.
Happy?
Oh, yeah.
You look like every girl at every bat mitzvah I ever had a crush on.
Let's see the bow.
Just like Jenny Gildenhorn.
Why do I wish you had braces?
Should we get you braces?
No, that's too much.
Here I come.
Nice shorts.
Thank you.
Believe it or not, they were not very expensive.
Do I really have to wear this all night?
You know the rules.
The date starts now and ends at midnight.
I decide what you wear, what you eat, and where we go.
Oh, and there is one more rule.
No matter what happens, you're not allowed to fall in love with me.
Won't be a problem.
Detective Boyle, I just wanted to say congratulations.
Your medal was well-deserved.
Thank you, sir.
Your breath is terrible.
Charles, can I speak with you?
Hey, where's Rosa?
I haven't seen her all night.
Did you know my wife pays me alimony?
Okay, let's take a seat.
I'm gonna keep an eye on you all night, little buddy.
Okay.
Thanks.
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.
Happy you made it.
Captain, I'd like you to meet my wife, Sharon.
It's so wonderful to meet you.
I've heard such great things about you.
And you.
Your husband is a real hero.
If you ask me, he should've been up there with Detective Boyle today.
What for?
For saving my life.
He means metaphorically.
You know, saving him from all that paperwork.
Paper cuts are a slow death, baby.
No, I was referring to how he threw his body at an emotionally disturbed criminal who was trying to kill me.
Nooo!
He did what?
Are you back in the field?
Oh.
I have caused a problem.
I think I am Getting a text message.
Bloop.
Ah.
There it is.
Why is this the first I'm hearing about this?
I thought I told you.
Remember when you were half asleep watching the news and the babies were quiet, and I said, real low, "hey, baby.
I'm back in the field.
You want something to eat"?
And you were like, "what"?
And I was like, "you want something to eat"?
And you said, "sure".
And I got you an oatmeal cookie?
Remember?
You are a piece of work, Terrance.
Oh, damn.
She called me Terrance.
I'm doomed.
Hot date coming through.
Hey, attention, everyone.
Now I know that tonight is Boyle's big night.
But let's forget about that completely for a moment and admire and comment on every terrible aspect of this.
Permission to go to the bathroom?
Granted.
First of three.
Use them wisely.
Hey.
Congrats again, buddy.
I really am proud of you.
Still wearing the medal, huh?
Yes, I want women to be impressed by me.
All right.
Well, I'm sorry that I can't stay, but I have a terrible night planned for Amy.
First up is the mall photo studio, where we'll take our official date portrait.
The picture will be the two of us playing one saxophone.
Then some peel-and-eat shrimp for dinner at a dangerously cheap seafood restaurant.
And then I've contracted a youth choir to serenade us.
Santiago Santiago Santiago Santiago You suck so bad Yes!
They'll sing to her at midnight the middle of Times Square.
She and will savor that memory for all times.
Jake, do you know why little boys pull little girls' pigtails on playgrounds?
'Cause they're so easy to grab.
They're just begging to be pulled.
Because they like the girls, and that's the only way they know how to get their attention.
What are you saying?
All of this teasing, this elaborate date, somewhere down deep, you like Amy.
Like, "like her," like her.
Okay, that's straight-up insanity.
How much did you spend on tonight?
$1,400, but all of it's on credit cards, so it's, like, $5 a month for the next 2,000 years.
I do not like Amy!
You're putting a lot of effort into a joke.
Why don't you sit down and have a real conversation with her?
Okay, Boyle, you live in your ex-wife's new boyfriend's basement.
I'm not taking advice from you.
Hup.
I'm ashamed of my living situation.
Rosa, why are you sequestered over by this old cell phone?
I'm avoiding Boyle and his truth bombs.
I sometimes worry I'm gonna become you.
He keeps saying he wants to talk to me.
I'm afraid he's gonna tell me he loves me or propose marriage or something.
Oh, my God.
That makes me kind of want to cry.
He dove in front of those bullets for me.
I can't be mean to him.
I watched him make coffee for 28 minutes this morning.
But I also can't lead him on.
Captain Holt told me not to let him get hurt tonight.
So I'll keep him away from you.
Have you seen Rosa?
Rosa died eight years ago.
Come on.
Let's get you a drink.
Excuse me, everyone.
Santiago and I will be performing the steerage jig from the film Titanic, which we have prepared for in no way, shape, or form.
Romantic.
No, embarrassing.
Milady.
You look pretty.
I hate your guts.
Channel that passion into the dance.
Peralta.
Scully, tag in.
Okay.
Keep spinning.
Yes.
One of our informants just called.
We've been tracking a crew that lifts cargo out of Laguardia.
The C.I. knows where the trucks unload, so I need you to stake out the drop site.
Oh, sir, I'm right in the middle of this date and I cannot reschedule.
I have far, far too many non-refundable deposits.
I'm renting a tiger cub by the hour.
For what?
Don't even know.
Waiting for inspiration.
Well, this is not a negotiation, so go.
All right, fine, but I'm taking Santiago with me.
As soon as we're done, it's back to the date.
Darling.
Brief pause.
Duty calls.
Oh, thank God.
Gina, tag in?
No, not even if it would cure cancer.
Okay.
Look, baby, I'm sorry, but Captain's life was in danger.
I just did what I had to do.
It was an impulse decision.
Well, I guess I can understand that.
Sharon.
I have to apologize.
I want to assure you that the call to put sergeant Jeffords back in the field wasn't a spur-of-the-moment, impulse decision.
It's been in the works for a few months now.
Terry said it just happened.
I think you two need to get your stories straight.
Perhaps I should stop talking to your wife.
That's a good call.
Captain.
Sharon.
I'm so happy to be out of that dress.
It was weirdly hot.
Oh, yeah, it's probably because it was a cotton and plastic blend.
But not to worry.
We're gonna catch these guys and get back to the worst date of your life.
No.
Nothing will ever be worse than the date I had with my aunt's dentist.
You should try some of this.
Okay.
Oh.
Okay.
Hold on.
Hmm?
Yeah, dessert is out of the question.
What was your worst date ever?
I think it's, like, a 50-way tie.
The last lady I went out with burst into tears when I told her I was a Gemini.
Wow.
Hey, those people left that door open.
I bet there's a better vantage point from the roof.
Mmm, and I bet it doesn't smell like old cheese.
Okay, that's hurtful.
Shall we?
Yeah.
So what else don't I know?
You cooking meth?
You breaking bad?
How many phones do you have?
I'm sorry, I need to clarify something I said earlier.
Sergeant Jeffords was correct when he said that his choice to go back in the field that night was an impulse decision.
He didn't even take the time to stop and gear up, so What?
So You didn't have your vest on?
Oh, no.
Oh, goodness.
I shouldn't have said that.
I feel I may have made things worse.
Wait.
I can fix this, Ray.
Now is not the time, Boyle.
Hush!
I want to hear this.
Boyle, let's not make big Hush.
Truth time.
We love your husband.
He's a great cop.
We will do anything to protect him.
And you have incredibly attractive hands.
And you, what the hell are you doing, lying to your wife?
Unless you want to end up moving into my ex-wife's new boyfriend's basement with me, you better man up.
Don't you ever keep anything from this beautiful woman again.
Seriously, you are beautiful.
Oh.
If he ever lies to you again, you can call me.
I'm sorry, honey.
I just didn't want you to worry.
Baby, I am always gonna worry about you.
But if you feel like you're ready, then get your ass back in the field.
But if you ever keep anything from me again, I will leave you for this short, earnest man and his ex-wife's new boyfriend's apartment.
I know you're kidding, but Hercules is actually a very good landlord.
Sometimes, when they go on nice vacations, I'm allowed to use the hot tub.
Man, I don't know how Batman does it.
It is super scary up here.
Hey, will you grab the binoculars?
They're in my stakeout bag.
Your stakeout bag is 98% nuts.
I get snacky.
Besides, nuts are super healthy.
They're, like, 0% fat.
Jake, that's not true at all.
It's actually the opposite.
What?
That nut vendor lied to me.
I think a pigeon just flew out of your car.
Yeah.
The windows don't exactly roll up.
The car's a piece of crap.
Why do you love it so much?
You really want to know?
I was two days out of the academy, super nervous.
Saw this guy run out of a bodega, clutching a bunch of cash.
So I pursued him on foot, 11 blocks.
Finally catch him, cuff him, throw him up against that car.
Turned out there was a for sale sign in the window, and, it being the best day of my life, I bought it.
Thus began the debt.
Crushing debt.
Yeah, you do know me.
Nut?
Only if you throw it.
Ready?
Ready?
Mm-hmm.
Nice.
You ready?
Uh-huh.
What are you doing?
Trying to catch it in your nose?
I got it, I got it, I got it.
It's Holt.
Keep practicing.
Okay.
Peralta.
Oh, good news, Peralta.
I found someone from the night shift to relieve you on your stakeout.
Ooh.
Still make Times Square.
Um You know, Captain, hold off on the relief team.
We're already here.
Plus I'm curious to see what happens.
Okay, it's your call.
All right.
What did Holt want?
Just checking in.
How you doing?
Any progress?
Yep.
Watch.
The key is volume.
I see that.
So be honest.
If you'd won the bet, were you really gonna destroy my car?
No.
I was gonna drive it.
So I could learn stick.
You wouldn't.
I would.
Would've been, like, No.
No!
Hey, hey!
There's our guys.
What's the play here?
Just follow my lead.
Give me the ring.
Now give me some nuts.
I'm snacky.
All right, fine, darling.
I'll ask him.
Will that make you happy?
Excuse me, sir.
We're kind of busye.
Yeah, my girlfriend, here, thinks we're lost.
No, I know we're lost.
I think he's an idiot.
Idiot?
You know why we're out here in the middle of the night, Susan?
I was gonna propose to you.
On the Brooklyn bridge, where we met.
Brooklyn bridge?
We met on the Manhattan bridge.
You know what?
This is over.
Say good-bye to the ring and everything it represents.
You son of a bitch!
Hey, hey.
Stop yelling hey, no one talks to Susan like that.
And you know what else?
On the ground!
NYPD!
NYPD!
You're under arrest.
Nice work.
You too.
I'm sad y'all are arresting me, but I gotta say, I'm glad you're back together.
Hey.
I need to talk to you.
Oh.
It's happening?
Remember when I took those bullets for you?
Okay, let's do this.
I think you're sweet I didn't know it was you.
When I jumped in front of those bullets, I didn't know who I was protecting.
I just saw a gun and an NYPD vest, and so I dove on instinct.
You've been extra nice to me because you thought I'd risked my life for you.
But I only did what every good cop would do.
When you finally go out with me, and you will, it'll be because I do things that only Charles Boyle would do.
Um, actually, I have a coat in here.
It's, uh it's, like actually, I see it.
It's, like it's blue it's, like, right Excellent job on the stakeout last night.
I'm glad to see you two still work well together despite that ridiculous bet.
Thanks.
Me too.
And I appreciate your turning down the relief team.
I'm not sure they could've made that bust.
Yeah.
Right.
The relief team.
So sorry you lost so much money last night.
Guess you can add it to your list of bad dates.
Nah, it still goes on the good date list.
You know, 'cause we caught the bad guys.
That's very mature of you.
Well, I am very mature man.
Package for Amy Santiago.
That's me.
Special delivery from Jake Peralta to say, "thanks for last night".
Oh, no.
I forgot to cancel.
Here I am Cancel what?
Sir, you don't have to Okay.
Okay.
All right, so Uhh eugh!
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
All right, stepping in, stepping in.
I'll take this bullet for you.
Ugh.
Hitchcock, what are you doing?
I thought aren't we all gonna no?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Morning, Scully.
How was your weekend?
Oh, fun.
Kelly and I hit the park, went for a long walk.
Fell asleep watching TV.
Oh.
Sounds like a fun weekend with Kelly.
So, Kelly.
Is that Scully's wife or his dog?
Uh Wait.
No one knows Scully's wife's name?
I think Kelly is his dog.
Went for a long walk.
That's what you do with a dog.
You can go on a long walk with a person.
At sunset.
Talking about nothing.
And everything.
Sounds awful.
Hit the park.
That's a dog.
My wife takes the babies to the park all the time.
All right, we're doing this.
Let's play "wife or dog".
Hey, so Scully, what do you do at the park with Kelly?
Oh, we just walk around.
She gets antsy if she doesn't get outside enough.
And then it's just yap, yap, yap, all day long.
Hey, what's Kelly's favorite food?
Peanut butter.
She'll eat it right out of the jar.
How old is Kelly again?
Well, she's getting up there, but she's pretty spry for her age.
Especially considering she got hit by that car a year ago.
Oh, that's so awful.
Was she chasing something into the street, or No.
Just getting me the newspaper.
All right, this is useless.
Scully, is Kelly your wife or your dog?
How can you ask me that?
I still don't know which it is.
- Could be either.
- I could not tell you.
Okay, what do you got?
Yup.
Oh, sir, are you looking for your glasses?
I borrowed them to do an impression of you.
It killed.
Peralta, give me my glasses.
Peralta, give me back my glasses.
Okay.
All right, lay out the steroids case.
It's a major operation.
And one of the biggest black market distributors in all of Brooklyn.
And it's centered at a gym called Brooklyn total body.
The center of our investigation is a guy named Brandon jacoby.
He did seven years at Rikers for assault.
We spent two weeks undercover infiltrating the gym.
"Gym-filtrating" it.
I coined that.
I think it'll really catch on if more people infiltrated gyms.
We believe that jacoby can link us to the distributors, but he only talks to trainers and other muscle heads.
So we want to bring in the sarge.
His name will be Trent Carter.
A personal trainer, bouncer, and assistant manager at petsmart.
It's the economy.
What can you do?
Gentlemen, have a seat.
Sergeant Jeffords is just getting back in the field.
What if he panics again?
Why is everyone so worried about the sarge?
I mean, he saved your life at the rail yard.
Okay.
It's your case.
But if anything goes wrong, it's on you.
Trust me, the sergeant will be fine.
If you want to worry about anyone panicking in the field it should be Boyle.
Damn straight.
Wait, why'd high five that?
'Cause you're a sucker for a high five.
Damn straight I am.
Captain, I need a favor.
My apartment got broken into last night.
Gina, that's terrible.
Are you okay?
I'm fine, but I suffered the loss of many treasured items.
Such as my grandma's jewelry, some cash, and this very fancy gown with, like, a magic eye print.
Do you have any connections in the FBI or CIA?
There's no one else I can turn to to solve this crime.
Gina, you work in a police precinct.
You can turn to anyone here.
You think these buffoons can help?
They're buffoons.
They are not buffoons.
Try the heel.
Still don't feel anything.
Awesome.
I wish I had nerve damage.
Some of them are buffoons.
But I'll find the non-buffoons to investigate.
Could you ask Scully to return my thumbtacks?
I already put 'em in a biohazard bag and tossed 'em in the furnace.
Good call.
You ready, sarge?
I was born ready.
And then I was not born ready for a while, but now I'm back to being born ready.
Yes!
The ebony falcon soars again.
The ebony falcon.
His feathers are muscles.
Let's talk strategy later tonight at my house.
My wife's working late, I'm on daddy duty.
But you're ready for this, right?
Absolutely.
I just need to put my precious babies to bed with a story.
The ebony falcon needs to read go, dog, go.
Yeah, he does.
Terry Jeffords is back!
Chest bump me.
You don't want to do this, man.
No, I really do.
It hurts you every time.
No, I know, but I'm fired up.
The adrenaline is gonna carry me through.
Here we go.
No signs of forced entry at the door.
But the window was jimmied.
You don't have locks on your windows.
Way to blame the victim.
Sorry I'm not rich like you, miss 1%.
They cost $8.
You have a fur bedspread.
Why do you have so many lycra bodysuits?
And why do you need eight full drawers of underwear?
Because I'm civilized.
Less talky-talk, more solvey-solve.
We need an itemized list of everything that was stolen.
I already gave it to Captain Holt.
$160 in cash, one TV, one large painting of a naked lady on a lion, one set of Joseph Gordon-levitt nesting dolls Wow.
Homemade and irreplaceable.
One music box that plays she works hard for the money when opened.
One knockoff designer clutch Can't you just buy another knockoff?
No, I can't, silly sue.
'Cause the label no longer makes the original, so the sweatshop no longer makes the knockoff.
Can you estimate the value of everything that was taken?
Emotionally, $700 million.
Somebody at the door.
Yeah.
Hey, sarge.
Sorry about the mess.
Hi, Cagney.
Hi, Lacey.
Hey, your kids like the same kind of cereal as me.
Well, we just finished story time.
I'm gonna kiss the girls night-night, then we can get down to business.
All right, time for night-night, girls.
He is so strong but so gentle.
He's like an enormous, muscular Ellen Degeneres.
You know, I just want to let you guys know that I love you girls so, so muc okay?
So sleep tight.
You know, daddy will never leave you, right, girls?
Night-night, daddy.
Gosh.
Really makes you understand what he went through.
I'm worried about Terry.
We can't let anything bad happen to him.
Jake, where are you?
In here.
Oh This is a classy tepee.
Should we get these instead of desks at work?
We have to get Terry off this case.
What?
Why?
Look, I thought he was a weirdo for having his year-long freak-out, but I get it now.
He has children.
What happens to them if he gets hurt?
I'll have to take care of them.
Or his wife or other family or his more mature friends, but interesting point.
Why is this just hitting you now?
I don't know, I guess I just hadn't seen his kids in so long he never takes them around the precinct for some reason.
Because of all the guns and danger.
If you have concerns, maybe you should talk to Terry about it.
No.
And you can't either.
If he finds out we're worried about him, it'll get in his head and freak him out.
He'll lose his edge and panic.
Yeah, that's why I've never tried to develop an edge.
You can't lose what you don't have.
No surprises.
What are you guys talking about?
Work.
International taxes and tariffs.
Work.
Heh.
So What's the plan at the gym?
Well, I say we slow-play it.
You know?
Do a little more setup, a little surveillance, wait a couple months and see if they turn themselves in.
Listen, man, I know everybody's worried about me being psychologically ready for this.
But I promise you I am.
No matter what happens, no matter how many bullets are flying, I'm gonna be right there in the middle of everything.
I got your back.
No, it's not even that, you know, it's just Well, frankly, I'm not so sure that everyone at the gym is gonna buy you as a trainer.
You've been sitting behind that desk for so long you've gotten a little tubby.
Right?
It's like, love handle alert!
Do you have a bone there somehow?
Jake, I promise.
I'm good.
Oops.
I gotta put this stuffed giraffe between my two girls.
They both like to snuggle against his head.
Here comes Mr. snuggles.
Here comes Mr. snuggles.
Okay, thanks.
Crime tech report from your apartment came back.
Apparently they found a strand of hair belonging to Mario Lopez.
I bought a lock of his hair at an auction.
That's cool it's real.
What'd they say about the prints?
None of the partials returned any matches.
Nobody in your building saw anything.
We've hit a wall.
So what do we do next?
Do I just look for another apartment?
Should I buy a handgun?
Should I buy a shotgun?
Should I buy an uzi?
Look, Gina, we've done all we can.
This is how it goes with most B and es.
Mm.
All right.
C'est la vie.
Let me grab your badge numbers.
'Cause I will be filing an official civilian complaint with the Captain.
Why did I just receive a civilian complaint about you two?
I can answer this.
Because your assistant is a goblin.
Captain, we swept the scene, ran the prints, canvassed the building.
We followed procedure.
"Procedure" is just a fancy word for proper order to do things.
Yes, that is it's definition.
This is a miscarriage of justice.
I'm gonna haunt your dreams.
You sure you can lift this much weight?
Are you kidding me?
I was the strongest kid in my camp seven summers in a row.
It would've been eight if that freak Rebecca Lobelman hadn't showed up.
Let's put in work.
And here we go.
One.
And I'm done.
That's it.
Oh, good rep.
Don't wanna get too bulky.
Two things.
First, this gym's wipe-down policy is criminally lax.
So I rewrote it.
Second, I lowered the temperature of the water fountain by two degrees.
Still waiting on feedback, but I see a lot of refreshed faces.
Also Brandon jacoby should be here soon.
How was that not one of your two things?
I gave his regular trainer the day off, I told him Trent would be filling in.
It was an interesting interaction.
Well, according to my new cloud-based scheduling system, your trainer is out, and Trent will be filling in.
I spent 40 minutes making that water bottle pyramid display.
This guy is a psycho.
You know the best way to deal with psychos.
The silent treatment.
We should draw him out by not engaging.
Nope.
The longer we wait the more likely our cover gets blown.
I'll make contact.
Okay, but just remember.
You're not Terry.
You're Trent.
Trainer and known hemophiliac, so be careful.
Trent is also a quaker who avoids violence at all costs.
You Trent?
Yup.
A black Trent.
One of many.
Uh, what do you want to start with today?
Weights.
Excuse me, sir.
Can I borrow this machine?
I need to be here to keep an eye on a friend.
Hold on.
I'm on my last set.
Okay.
Two Three Can you go any faster?
I mean, what do you need leg muscles for anyway?
You're, like, 100 years old.
Socially acceptable for you to roll around on a scooter.
I lost the count.
One.
One?
You're not even moving.
Let's go.
Get your hands off me!
I've heard about this in the news!
You're cyber-bullying me!
Shh!
I'm getting the manager!
Get the hell away from me!
No, you're very misinformed.
Please don't Damn it.
Hey.
Have you seen Terry?
I lost him.
His children could be orphans already.
Fatherless, mother-having orphans.
I'm sure he's fine.
I think the bigger issue is the complaint I received from an older gentleman saying you tried to hurry him off his machine, in open defiance of gym protocol.
Don't do this.
I know we're friends, but if you do that again, I'm gonna have to suspend your membership.
What have you become?
Me.
I've become me.
What?
Oh, sarge, thank God.
Where were you?
What happened?
Nothing happened.
Jacoby wanted to do wind sprints outside.
You know, he's a mean dude, but I think I'm making progress.
He asked to borrow my squat belt, I told him no, he respected that.
Okay, but let's build up that relationship slowly, okay?
We don't want to jump the gun and spook him.
Whew!
'Sup?
Good workout.
You know, it's weird I never worked out with you before.
What'd you say your regular gym was?
I didn't.
Brooklyn bulk fitness.
Huh?
I work out there too.
Never heard of any Trent.
I don't know why.
I work out there all the time.
Really?
Starting when?
NYPD, hands on your head!
My God, you're gigantic.
What are you doing, Peralta?
You just blew my cover!
Or did I save your life?
Or did you compromise an investigation and piss off a superior officer?
I'm sensing from your tone it's that one.
I need some afternoon coffee.
What's the matter with you?
Gina came by my house last night to go over the case.
Between us doing that and her using my bread maker all night, I didn't get much sleep.
I will say she makes a wonderful rye.
So dense, yet so moist.
Hello, ladies.
Since you have allowed crime to win, I've hired a private investigator to solve my case.
Say hello to Leo Sporm.
A P.I.?
These guys are hacks.
How do you know if your husband's a murderer?
You don't.
Call Leo now.
Leo Sporm.
How's business?
You know this guy?
Everyone knows him.
The Picasso of hucksters.
I like that.
"Look up who Picasso is".
Sporm.
Out.
Now.
You blew our cover, man!
Now I gotta go into an interrogation with no evidence and try to get jacoby to rat out his distributors!
I'm sorry, I got jumpy.
I wasn't thinking straight.
It was all the exercise.
The blood from my head rushed into my delts.
Point to your delts, Jake.
There is You didn't have to hop in there, man.
I can handle this.
What's my name?
Terry Jeffords.
What is my name?
The ebony falcon.
And what does the ebony falcon do?
Takes every precaution to ensure his own safety?
Takes bad guys to jail and bad girls to bed.
Hell yeah, he does.
Except now the ebony falcon is monogamous and too tired for sex, so his only indulgence is fresh fruit yogurt parfaits.
Terry loves yogurt.
How's it going?
Well, so far jacoby hasn't given anything up, but I think Terry's starting to get to him.
I'm not talking.
You're talking right now!
Boom!
I'm already in your head.
Sarge is safe in there, so the longer this interrogation goes the better.
We gotta solve the case before he does.
Hey, tell me about that new system you set up at the gym for scheduling appointments.
I've been waiting so long to hear you say those words.
Come with me.
Experience the future of cloud-based scheduling.
Okay.
I put all the trainers' schedules into a shared online calendar.
Aside from the cucumber water at the front desk, it's probably my greatest accomplishment ever.
Hang on a sec.
Who's this guy?
Says he's a personal trainer at the gym, but he has no regular hours.
He always makes last-minute appointments, always in the boxing area, and always late at night.
And look who he trains.
Brandon jacoby.
That's probably our supplier.
We should set up a buy from this Vladimir Rincic.
All right.
We should set up a tactical team and hit the gym.
And sergeant Jeffries should stay here and keep interrogating jacoby for as many hours or years as necessary.
Are you sure I shouldn't go get him?
I feel a little uncomfortable leaving him out of this.
Don't think of it as leaving him out so much as including his babies in having a father.
Let's go.
Detectives.
Where are you going?
Just headed out to close the steroid case.
Isn't sergeant Jeffries interrogating the suspect now?
Yup, he's got that locked up.
We're following up on this lead.
The whole team is running smoothly and perfectly like a well-lubed, oiled time clock bye.
Why do you think Gina hired that P.I.?
To mock us.
She's scared.
She's not scared.
With all due respect, sir, Gina has no feelings.
She once said the best comedy of all time was the girl with the dragon tattoo.
Well, think about how she's been acting.
Gina came by my house last night.
Do I buy an uzi?
I asked for a police officer to escort me to work, and it took a while for dispatch to find me a young Kevin costner type.
Her home doesn't feel safe anymore.
If someone broke into your apartment and you weren't cops, wouldn't you be scared?
Yes.
Depends.
How many guns do I still have hidden?
None.
Do I still have my knife?
Nunchucks?
Axe?
It was a hypothetical question.
I know, but I want to play it out.
Do I still have my throwing stars?
This has taken a strange turn.
Fine.
I'd be scared.
We're on it.
What kind of woman doesn't have an axe?
All right, we're all set for the sting.
We got hidden cameras, wireless mics, and tactical teams by all the exits.
I told Vladimir to meet Vance Vandervaven, a.K.A. me, here at 10:00.
Said that I was filling in for jacoby.
You and I will be sparring when he arrives.
Cool.
I boxed at the academy.
They invented a new weight class for me.
You're looking at the undisputed bubbleweight champion.
Hey!
Peralta!
Boyle!
Sarge, hey.
I'm so psyched you made it here to the sting that I definitely told Charles to tell you about.
You lied to me!
I can see that you're upset, but let's just sit down and talk about it.
Done talking!
Time to dance.
Fine.
But I should warn you.
I took three years of tap.
Again, sarge, it's so good to see you.
Just out of curiosity, how did you find out about this?
I'm a Detective sergeant in the NYPD.
Holt told me.
Why are you cutting me out of the operation?
What?
That's crazy!
Boyle, come in here and stand in front of my body and tell him that's crazy.
Ow!
My lucky face!
You gonna talk to me now?
Sure.
If you could be any vacation Oh!
You didn't let me finish.
If you could be any vacation, what would you be?
I'd be skiing.
Oh, now I'm gonna hit you for real.
That wasn't for real?
Oh, my God.
No, wait, wait, wait!
I was worried!
Worried about what?
About you getting hurt.
I don't want your daughters growing up without a dad.
I know what that's like, and it sucks.
And I don't want it to happen to them.
Why didn't you just say something to me?
Because I didn't want to get in your head and have you freak out again.
Yeah, I get it.
It's been a rough year.
But I've learned to embrace my fears.
It makes me a better cop.
Tacs one and two are set.
the bogeys arrive.
Thanks, Boyle.
I love it when you say "bogeys".
So we good?
We good.
And for the record If I could be any kind of vacation I'd be lake trip.
Classic.
You're here late.
Ah, you know me.
I love working.
Can't tear me away from my work.
I just love requisitions and corporate record reports.
Just, you know, messages from people for Holt.
I can imagine how frightening this must be.
I'm sorry we didn't catch the guy.
Yeah.
It's weird.
It's like, why do the worst things always happen to the best people?
And what's to keep it from happening again?
We are.
Come on.
We're taking you home.
Really?
We installed a second lock on your front door, put locks on the windows by the fire escape, and set all your lights on timers.
That makes me feel so much better.
Thank you, guys.
And as a token of my appreciation, I would like to give you These.
Great.
The cool thing is you can eat whatever you want.
These are right there with you.
Hey!
You Vance Vandervaven?
Yeah.
That's me.
I'll be right there.
You gonna let me do this, man?
What choice do I have?
You hit me in the arms so hard they no longer work.
All right.
It's time to catch some bad guys.
It good to be back.
Have a fun steroid deal, sergeant.
You're a weird guy, Jake.
Yeah.
The ebony falcon.
No.
The ebony falcon had no fear.
He's the ebony antelope now.
Brave enough to drink at the lake, but wise enough to run from the lions.
Hey, my arms don't work.
Can you scratch my nose?
You bet.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Morning, Captain.
So?
How did sergeant Jeffries do?
Why is everyone so worried about the sarge?
He was amazing.
He made the buy, took out the suppliers, but wisely didn't take on more than he could handle.
I left one for you.
And you'll be happy to know that he punched me in the face several times.
That does make me happy.
Guess we're being candid today.
Hey, sarge, just for the record, I hope you're on every case with me for the rest of my career.
I'm not scared for you at all.
Of you a lot.
Thanks, Jake.
Oh, Peralta, I almost forgot.
My girls made you a card.
To thank you for keeping me safe.
Oh They're so full of potential.
Why would you show me this?
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
We've busted murderers, we've taken down cartels.
But today we face the worst New York has to offer The fire department.
Fire marshal Boone, we meet again.
Detective Peralta, your fly's down.
I made you look.
I didn't look.
And I'm wearing shorts, there is no fly.
That's not what your mom said.
You make no sense.
And now I'm inside your head.
Prepare to die.
Blue 52.
Hut.
Yeah!
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down You're the best around Ah, ah, ah.
You don't have to dance every time.
True, but I choose to dance every time.
Whoo!
You have one play.
You give the ball to Jeffords, and he runs it in.
I-I'd like to see you score one.
Good, 'cause you're about to see it.
You're about to see it straight to hell.
Hut, hut.
You're the best now, Terry.
Nothing's gonna ever keep you down Yeah!
I did it.
I did it alone.
I'm the King of the world!
Whoo!
Cream in my coffee and rock and roll Peralta.
Ah, Captain Holt.
You look very sad?
I can never tell.
Do you have a murder suspect to question?
He is in the interrogation room as we speak, sitting and, I assume, stewing.
I put on a song that I think sums up his situation nicely.
I got you, babe because, you see You got him, babe.
I understood the wordplay, yes.
Oh.
I've been chasing this guy for three months.
I've got him dead to rights.
Fingerprints, witnesses, it's in the bag.
So I'm just gonna grab a healthy breakfast Are those gummy bears wrapped in a fruit roll-up?
Breakfast burrito, but yeah.
I pity your dentist.
Ah, joke's on you.
I don't have a dentist.
Jake, Jake.
Uh-oh, this can't be good.
Major crimes division just called.
They're taking over your murder case.
The vulture is on his way here now.
No!
Doesn't that guy get tired of stealing our cases?
He took one from me and Rosa last week.
NYPD.
Stop!
Ugh.
You made us run up ten flights of stairs.
It's over.
Thanks, guys.
I got it from here.
Don't worry, we can stall him until you get the confession.
We rehearsed this, you guys.
This isn't a drill.
Everyone know their assignments?
All right, hands in.
Broken feather.
And go!
Okay, Gus, I don't have a lot of time.
I need your full, signed confession.
We have four minutes.
We can do this.
But I'm not guilty.
Listen to me, Gus.
We can do this, son.
Yo, is this a police station or a toilet?
'Cause all I see is turds.
Oh, Detective Pembroke.
Oh, no.
I spilled coffee on you by accident.
Lucky for you, this wipes off quickly.
This coat's made out of whale skin.
The vulture still flies.
The vulture still flies.
Hey, Pembroke.
What do you say we go talk about a case in the break room?
Oh, yeah?
What case is that?
The case of how you got so damn sexy.
God owed me a favor.
Case solved.
I told you, I didn't know the guy.
You're lying.
We have pictures of you two.
Come on, we only have three minutes.
It's like you're not even trying to confess!
The vulture is coming.
We need more time.
Someone do something.
I got it.
Tear gas.
Scully, Scully, wrap my shirt around your face.
And out of the tear gas rises the Phoenix.
Hey, Peralta.
I got it from here.
All right, fine.
I'll just go then With this fully signed confession.
We did it, Gus!
Whoo!
Suck it, vulture.
I killed that guy and his neighbor, but you were too late.
Whoo!
Wait, you killed his neighbor?
Amy, check it out.
Nice, you got it framed?
Of course.
It commemorates our victory over the vulture, the greatest day in human history.
Sorry the tear gas made you look like a demon dog at the end of ghostbusters.
Brief me on the hotel robberies.
Helpful hint to the scientists that programmed you, most humans say "hello" at the beginning of a conversation.
Manager at the prentiss hotel told us that someone's been breaking into the rooms, stolen over $100,000 in jewelry.
We're heading over there now.
Keep me updated.
Another helpful hint Good-bye.
It's learning.
What?
Man, an hour of footage, and we've got nothing.
I have to admit, I do love a thorough vacuumer.
I'm a little o.C.D. What?
No, you're not.
Whoop.
I can leave it there.
Totally.
It doesn't bother me.
I know.
There it is.
All right, let's get started.
So we have good news, and we have bad news.
My Nana always said, "bad news first, because the good news is probably a lie".
Fun fact, she made me cry a lot.
Good news is, the sting we set up to catch deadbeats went great.
Name's bill voss, just got this thing in the mail, said I won a free Bahamas cruise!
Congratulations, bill.
You have six outstanding warrants for credit fraud.
Oh, man, can't it wait till I get back from the Bahamas?
I won a cruise.
You're not very bright, are you, bill?
Now I know you'd all prefer to go to a bar, drink beer, and eat chips of various textures.
But our compstat numbers are due tomorrow morning, so I need these arrests on the books today.
Darn it.
I had a belly dancing class.
Tonight was Egyptian undulation.
Oh, show us some moves.
Sure.
Dismissed.
First batch of arrest files is done-zo Washington.
There's only three files here.
It's been an hour.
Yeah, I know.
It has not been a productive morning.
For example, somebody used the toaster in front of Boyle.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Tommy?
And then Boyle spent 30 minutes lecturing him on how to make a sandwich.
I'd describe the work flow today as dismal with a tiny, little splash of pathetic.
Get me out of here, man.
I'm worried.
The compstat numbers are due tomorrow at 9:00 A.M., but at this rate, we won't be finished until your daughters are grown and married.
I may have a solution.
We need to compstat the office.
What is compstat?
It's just using data to identify problem spots in the neighborhood.
Now, I have been taking notes on points of friction in this office for years.
The red areas are places where no work gets done.
If we can fix these problems without anyone knowing what we're doing, we will finish on time.
Are you saying you want to secretly perform scientific experiments on your friends and coworkers to increase efficiency?
Yes.
Sounds fun, let's do it.
Hey, hand me some peanuts.
I'm snacky.
I have something I need to talk to you about.
I might get a promotion to major crimes.
They asked me to come in and interview for a job.
What?
You're gonna go work for the vulture?
Have you forgotten how awful he is?
The Vladimir putin collection?
Yeah, 70 bucks a pair.
And they only increase in value.
I guess that's your new best friend now, Santiago.
Emphasis on "iago," backstabber.
I'm surprised you've read othello.
What the hell's othello?
I'm calling you the parrot from Aladdin.
I wouldn't be working for the vulture.
I'd be working with him in data analysis.
Oh, it's just a lousy desk job?
Okay, never mind.
You're not gonna do that.
You love working cases too much.
We're gonna catch this perp.
You're gonna remember how much you love your job.
You're gonna skip that interview.
And that's a Peralta guarantee.
Your last Peralta guarantee was that you could dunk a basketball.
I never said I couldn't use a ladder.
Peralta guarantee achieved.
Aah!
The subtext of the guarantee was that you would be entertained, and you were.
Let's go!
Okay, so I've already taken care of a few obvious problems.
I moved the toaster to the break room, far away from Boyle.
Good.
What's this red area here, the Diaz triangle?
Right, so you know about Rosa's anger incidents.
It's my birthday.
I hate birthdays.
If you wish me a Happy Birthday, I will punch you.
You're a funny little bird, Diaz.
Happy Birthday.
Any time mt.
Diaz erupts, everyone on the squad avoids her.
Mt.
Diaz.
Humorous, yes.
Tell me, what room is just down the hall from her desk?
The bathroom.
If people are afraid to walk by Diaz, bathroom breaks would be to a minimum.
Hey, Diaz, I just need to make sure I've got the details right in this file.
Yeah, guy was passing bad checks.
But is this the same guy?
Yeah, the name here is the same name on the checks.
Ca-caw!
Okay, all right, thank you, thank you.
Ca-caw!
Got it.
Come on!
I'm so sick of these sucky computers.
Aah!
One more step and you're next.
NYPD.
Oh, boy.
NYPD, sir.
Have you seen anything unusual today?
Oh, no.
This was nice, thank you.
Wait, wait, wait.
What is this music?
Leirkrakeegovnia.
Do you like it?
I weirdly do.
meil on fun Me teeme asju mis on ponev Olemme sobrad kasu See, Amy, fun thing about working cases, you meet people from all over the world.
This song is a celebration song from when a dog loses its virginity.
Who checks that?
I was having a smoke, and I saw a bellboy take his jacket off and throw it in the dumpster, then go back inside.
Well, that's unusual.
Yeah, that's why I'm telling you.
Looks like we are going dumpster diving.
Great.
Come with me, Amy, to the dumpster Me and Amy going diving in the dumpster I can't believe you would ever consider leaving this job.
This is real police work, and you love it.
Remember that time you had to shove your hand down that woman's throat to get her car keys?
Why do you even care if I leave?
Because the vulture is the worst.
That whole division is the worst.
They steal cases.
It's the lowest of the low.
So if I transferred somewhere else, you wouldn't care at all?
No, of course not.
Do whatever you want, you know, it's your life.
Aha!
The jacket.
This case is heating up.
Ooh, receipt in the pocket.
Dust it for prints.
And send a scan to Boyle.
Yes.
You're feeling it now.
Whoo!
The thief's name is Benjamin disanto.
Here's an old mug shot.
He's surprisingly photogenic.
A lot of criminals are, strangely.
He doesn't work here.
Must have stolen the bellhop uniform.
Receptionist just spotted disanto entering the salieri ballroom.
What's going on in there?
An auction of Greek antiquities.
Ah, I believe it's pronounced "antiques".
I'm sorry about my partner.
He's never been to a museum.
Have so.
Wax museums don't count.
Then why are they called museums?
It's right there in the name.
Oh, my God.
Come on.
It's going really well, sir.
We've gone from 10 cases per hour to almost 20.
It's good, but we can do better.
Tell me about the Boyle-linetti reaction.
Boyle gets cold a lot because of what he calls his Medically diagnosed thin skin.
So he goes to the lost and found, and he grabs something that's usually unflattering.
That's when Gina gets involved.
Sweet sweater, Charles.
You look like you're starring in an Albanian remake of the cosby show.
Dr. huxtable, Dr. huxtable.
Gina is completely useless when Boyle is wearing lost-and-found clothes.
Well, I really can't blame her on this one.
Maybe we should just, uh, empty lost and found.
Already done, sir.
Good lord.
Where did he get that?
Oh, my God, we're doomed.
Boyle looks like a lesbian.
He must have gotten it from the evidence locker or something.
Don't worry.
I had a backup plan.
I distracted her with a mirror.
She's like a cockatiel, sir Fascinated by her own reflection.
Mm.
Hello, sexy, how are you?
Right back at ya.
Well done.
Good afternoon, sir, I'm Detective Peralta.
This is Detective always-stays-loyal.
She's named after her father Alvin stays-loyal.
We're tracking a thief that's stolen thousands of dollars worth of jewelry.
We think he's scouting auction winners, so he can Rob their rooms.
We called for backup, but we need to move now.
And we have to keep it quiet.
What can I do to help?
Well, there's too many people in here.
I need a better vantage point.
Any way I can get up onstage by the podium?
You'll blow our cover if you go up there.
You don't exactly blend in.
Yeah.
Irwin, how would you like to have the honor of being the first man to undress in front of Amy Santiago?
Okay.
Here we go.
Hello, everyone.
My name is Roger strikewell, and I will be your guest auctioneer this evening.
So many faces to look at.
I won a radio contest, and I'm so excited to be here tonight to sell you all of these cool, old, Greek things.
Our first item up for bid is lot number 344.
It is this old "vase," "vahs" if you're nasty.
It was made in the year five and depicts the classic Greek fable: Boy meets girl, boy has goat legs.
And on the back, just a whole bunch of wheat.
So let's start the bidding at $10.
Okay, started it way too low.
We've done it, sir.
If we stay on this pace, I think we'll finish on time.
I think we should keep going, make the office even more efficient.
Sir, are you familiar with the story of icarus?
He didn't know when to quit.
He flew too close to the sun, and his wax wings melted, and he died.
Are you familiar with the story of moneyball?
A man uses statistics and logic to win several baseball games.
It's my favorite film.
The statistical analysis It's so beautiful.
This office is becoming a powerhouse of paperwork processing.
I'm flying high, sergeant, and I'm never coming down.
I have 85.
Do I have 90?
I have 90 from the man with the face at table four.
This is terrible you don't know what you're doing.
Adam Sandler?
Yeah, that's right.
I collect antiquities.
I'm a serious person.
I'm writing a movie right now about the Russian revolution.
Oh, really?
Who does Kevin James play in it?
Ha, ha.
It's a serious movie.
Trotsky.
Ah, there it is.
But he's got a wife who never wears a bra.
I think you're gonna like it.
Thanks for dressing up, by the way.
All right, back to this plate.
I think you could use it for a variety of things.
New item up there.
How much you guys wanna pay for me to stick my socks in this moron's mouth?
I will.
Did football legend Joe Theismann just bid $1,000 to put a sock in my mouth?
You bet.
Okay, but let's get it going a little higher.
Seriously, back to the porno plate Uh, 1,200 bucks, sock in the mouth?
Boom, okay, the idiot gets the sock in the mouth.
I'd say 1,300 would be even better.
Joe Theismann coming in strong.
I got 1,300.
and a one and a two and a Boom, sold to Joey Theismann!
Congratulations, you're getting a sock in your mouth, Can I stick the sock in his mouth?
I'll pay extra.
Yes, you may, because I just sold my item to the man in the gray shirt at table 18.
NYPD.
You're under arrest.
Heading your way.
Gotcha!
My leg!
My leg!
You broke my other leg.
Uh Oh, this was supposed to be a safe event.
Nothing to see here.
Except for the bone, sticking out of the leg.
Joe, I video'd it!
What a day, huh?
Met Adam Sandler, broke Joe Theismann's leg, and solved an awesome case together.
Yeah, good day.
Hell yeah, it is.
Drinks are on me.
Jake, I'm still doing the interview.
What?
No.
Don't do that.
We still have to process the perp.
You love processing It's your favorite thing, after organizing your emails and replacing toilet paper rolls.
This job would be a great opportunity for me.
Okay, whatever.
You know what?
You're being a bad partner.
You're joining forces with the enemy.
And from now on, I'm gonna call you "the cheetah".
They're scavengers, just like vultures.
And I kinda wish I hadn't said it, 'cause they're pretty cool.
Come on, jewel thief.
You're my only friend now.
Scully, what are you doing at my desk?
And working?
What is going on today?
The Captain put me here.
Says I waste time when I sit next to Hitchcock.
Okay, well, go work in the break room.
Hello, Peralta.
Ah, a human greeting, nicely done.
Updates on the case?
Well, you're gonna love this one.
We busted the guy for grand larceny.
And to celebrate, Santiago is taking a job interview at major crimes.
Can you believe that?
Yes, she told me yesterday.
What?
Why didn't you try and talk her out of it?
She would literally shave her head if you asked her to.
Which, by the way, is a great idea for a prank, if you're looking to prank her.
Santiago wants to make Captain one day.
I know, because I've frequently caught her wearing my hat and looking into a mirror.
Dismissed.
I support her decision.
That's what good detectives do.
They have each other's back, no matter what.
All right, let's move on to your unpaid parking tickets.
Dude.
Dude, fire.
Oh, my.
Fire.
Uh, hey!
Fire!
Oh, I-I got it, okay.
Here we go.
Here we go, Boyle.
I got it.
What happened, Scully?
I didn't know there was a toaster there.
Why is the toaster there?
Uh-oh.
Aah!
My fringe!
My beautiful fringe!
Boyle's on fire!
Icarus.
Extinguisher's empty, morons.
Aah!
Back to the drawing board.
Sir, I'm begging you, please, we have to stop.
Boyle is still smoldering.
The problem is, we didn't take Peralta into account.
In our next trial Hello, boys.
Welcome to your own office.
I hear you're trying to make the precinct more efficient.
Gina, what are you doing in the Captain's chair?
Please, I'm open to any ideas about efficiency.
I've narrowed the problem down to one location: The Holt-Jeffords vortex.
Things would go a lot faster if the two of you did less experimenting and more working.
And I'm not the only one who thinks that.
You melted my fringe.
You think I have an anger problem?
I don't.
You are both dead to me.
Well, I suppose it's possible we may have been a tad enthusiastic in our pursuit of efficiency Really?
A tad, icarus?
Fine, message received.
Jeffords and I will get right to work.
Great, that will be all.
Thank you.
Get the hell out of my chair.
All right, I pushed it a little bit on that one.
Okay, bye.
Ah, Santiago.
Before you go in there, there's something I have to say.
I'm sorry I said you were a bad partner.
I was the bad partner.
The truth is, our job isn't always great.
I mean, sometimes it sucks.
But it sucks a little less when I get to do it with you.
So when you said you were gonna leave, I freaked out, and that was dumb.
I should've been more supportive.
You're a great Detective, and they'd be lucky to have you.
In fact, if it helps, I wrote you a letter of recommendation, which is riddled with spelling errors, I might add.
Including the word, "recommendation," which is just I don't have to tell you about that.
There's no way there's four "m"s in that word, right?
I already turned down the job.
Seriously?
In the end, you were right.
I don't wanna sit at a desk.
And right now, I like where I am.
Ah.
But thanks for thinking I'm great.
No, I take back all of the things I just said.
Uh-uh.
You said I was a good Detective, and you were nice.
This is my nightmare.
Lookee, lookee.
I thought I saw your big, white ass lumbering around.
As for you, Santiago, well, now you certainly showed your true colors, didn't you?
And they're a shade of pink called "loser".
All right, everybody just calm down.
There's no reason we can't be friends.
Here, I brought you a peace offering.
Run!
Uh-oh.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Everyone, check your email.
The greatest thing that could ever happen has just happened.
The girl who beat you for high school valedictorian died?
No, "Kevin Cozner requests your presence At Raymond's birthday party".
Who's Kevin Cozner?
Is he the star of "Danzes with Wolvez"?
He's captain Holt's husband.
Captain Raymond Holt.
We're invited to the captain's birthday party.
Oh, the captain's party and whatnot.
I can't wait to see the inside of Raymond's house.
I'm gonna learn everything there is to know about him.
I bet it's really fancy, like beauty and the beast fancy.
No, it's probably just an empty, white cube With a usb port in it for him to plug his finger in When he's on sleep mode.
Apparently, my husband Kevin has invited you all to my party.
There is very little street parking, no gifts, No singing of happy birthday.
Should be fun.
Sounds fantastic.
Did you hear that?
His husband invited us, not him.
He so doesn't want us there.
Yes, he does.
Mm, it was kind of a last-minute invite.
Just stirring the pot.
Why wouldn't Holt want us there?
Because he thinks we're going to embarrass him In front of his husband, which, frankly, is insulting!
Oh, man.
All the orange soda spilled out of my cereal.
Happy birthday, you sly, old fox.
How many spankings is it this year?
Peralta, please.
Save some charm for the party.
Oh, you mean the party that you begrudgingly invited us to At the last minute 'cause you don't want us there?
I couldn't be happier you're coming.
And it shows.
I can't wait to meet Kevin.
I assume he's the fun one in the relationship.
I'm not sure you and Kevin will get along.
Really?
Well, I disagree.
In fact, I will guarantee you that by the end of the night, Kev and I will be best friends.
He hates being called "Kev".
Or does he?
Yes.
Bam!
Behold, my secret weapon for winning over Kevin.
In this box is every grisly crime The nine-nine has worked in the past eight years.
Civilians love juicy cop stories.
Oh, I call that murder where they strung Fishing wire through three guys.
Hey, we solved that together.
Well, tough tetris.
I called it.
Also, I've loaded all of my favorite karaoke backing tracks Onto my phone.
Kevin and I will be duetting rolling in the deep!
That's it, emergency squad meeting, Briefing room, two minutes.
Uh, adult parties?
Sergeant, I believe they're called orgies.
No-look five.
I met my wife at an orgy.
Well, she was leaving an orgy, And we bumped into each other on the street.
Real meet-cute.
Thank you for exhibiting exactly why this meeting is necessary.
Everyone here needs some instruction On interacting with grown-ups.
Sergeant, why am I here?
I'm always incredibly appropriate.
In high school, I was voted "most appropriate".
Ooh, self burn.
Those are rare.
I shouldn't be here either.
I'm fine at parties.
I just stand in the middle of the room and don't say anything.
Here are the rules: No staring at your phones, No rolling in two hours late.
No sweatpants, no jeans, and no shorts.
What about dress-up shorts?
For instance, the kind jen aniston might wear?
No, those are still shorts.
No shorts.
And everyone bring a bottle of wine.
Why are there so many rules?
I mean, next thing You're gonna say is we can't be late.
Yeah, that's, like, the first thing I said.
Ohh.
This neighborhood's amazing.
Class just seeps outta every vestibule.
Keep it in your pants, Santiago.
Scully, I specifically said, "no shorts".
Sarge, it's not my fault.
You said so many things about shorts, I got confused.
Man, did I screw the pooch.
Oh.
Peralta, Where have you been?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know, I am threety-five minutes late.
Yikes!
But I had to stop and get some wine.
Hello, good sir, I'd like your finest bottle of wine, please.
That will be $1,600.
Great, I'd like your $8-est bottle of wine, please.
It's from the finest vineyard in arkansas.
Ah, samesies!
Wow.
Wow.
Ah, welcome.
Captain.
Raymond!
Those slacks are a knockout.
Come on, amy.
I trust you found my home easy to locate, And thank you all for wearing appropriate footwear.
Wow, you really let your hair down When you're not at the office.
Ah, detectives, meet my husband, Kevin.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.
Evening, so glad you could make it.
Ah, and look, he brought us some wine.
"drink".
this is legally called "wine drink".
Hmm, how very thoughtful.
Thank you.
It's red.
Like blood.
You know, I worked a double homicide On this block a couple years ago.
The details will astound you.
Yes, I am sorry.
Perhaps Raymond didn't say anything.
Our home has a "no shoptalk" policy.
I don't bring home beowulf, And he doesn't bring home cop stories.
Ah.
So may I pour you Some of this wine drink you brought us?
Perhaps all of it?
All of it sounds good.
Actually, ray and I met over the phone.
Oh, they've all heard the story.
No, we haven't, and we need to.
Well, ray was a source for an article I was writing For The New Yorker.
I asked him a series of dry questions About police work, and his answers had me in stitches.
There's no one funnier than ray Holt.
Amen.
There isn't?
We met for a drink that night, And we've been together ever since.
Yeah.
So, Kevin, I hear you're a professor at columbia?
That's right, yes.
I head the classics department.
Ah, interesting, classics.
Zeppelin, Hendrix, Die Hard.
Total classics head over here.
I'm joking, obviously.
I know what the classics are.
The odyssey andThe one you said when we got here, The wolf one.
Kevin, why don't we go mingle And let the detectives settle in?
Boyle, what happened to your shirt?
I spilled a wonderful winter salsa.
Here, wear my shirt.
I was gonna take it off anyway.
Hitchcock, no!
Boyle, take my sweater.
Fits really well.
We have similar physiques.
We've been here all of four minutes, And you guys have already forgotten everything I said!
Party huddle, stat!
Okay, gang, we need a new strategy.
Totally.
What is going on out there?
We can't tell cop stories, Kevin doesn't find me charming, And a native english speaker referred to captain Holt As "hilarious".
I am flummoxed!
That's a word I learned for this party, and I am it!
Well, I'm doing fine.
Really?
"Raymond, those slacks are a knockout".
do you think he heard that?
Only 'cause you yelled it.
Shut up.
From now on, we play to our strengths.
Charles, you know everything about food.
That's all you talk about.
Will ever know everything about food.
It's an evolving discipline.
That's great stuff.
It's so boring.
Don't waste it.
Amy, you studied art history.
That's interesting.
Scully, opera.
Hitchcock, nothing.
Talk about nothing.
Rosa, stick with Gina.
Make sure she doesn't say anything insane Or steal anything.
Too late.
Don't worry, it's just, like, hats and scarves and stuff.
She will put those back.
I will handle the chitchat.
Well, that just leaves you, Peralta.
What's your cultural specialty?
Easy, Kevin mentioned The New Yorker, And I've totally read that.
Keep a low profile, chuckle at anecdotes.
Try not to start any conversations.
Got it.
Wait a minute, you're Hitchcocking me?
Well, not surprising.
We're practically twins.
"be appropriate," on three.
Quietly.
One, two, three.
Be appropriate.
Now, break it up.
We look weird.
Okay.
Don't move as a group.
You're not gazelles.
No, no, I said, "millimeters".
Oh, Ray, I'm gonna choke from laughter.
You're too funny!
Yes, great humor words, Raymond.
You know, it reminds me of a very interesting article I read about human trafficking in The New Yorker.
No, it doesn't.
Oh.
The one written by David Remnick.
I loved that piece, from four weeks ago.
Or was it three weeks?
No, four.
Anyways, I was riveted.
I'm a huge New Yorker guy.
I could talk about that article for hours.
Great.
That's unnecessary.
Let's do that right now.
Let's do.
Ah, there they are.
Kevin, let's greet our guests.
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
Duty calls.
To be continued.
Totes!
Can't wait!
I can wait.
All I remember about that article is the title.
I was hopped up on nitrous.
Well, we gotta find that magazine.
It's gotta be in here somewhere, right?
This place is like a candy store for nerds.
Stop eating crab wrong!
Ah, pepper relish on your arancini.
Very playful.
Cut through the richness, Add a little levity.
I love that.
You really know your food.
Well, you could say it's the only thing I'm allowed to talk about.
I'm Charles.
I work with captain Holt.
I'm vivian ludley.
I work with Kevin.
No.
The vivian ludley?
Author of stone fruits and stone-stones: Food of the paleolithic era?
I'm a huge fan!
It's got the best recipes for making salads out of moss.
The trick is, you have to lean into the dirt taste.
Aha.
Mm-hmm.
Chickpeas, tahini, smoked paprika They make their own hummus.
Santiago?
Sergeant!
I'm learning so much.
We both have blue hand towels, we have the same microwave, And once I buy coasters made out of geodes, We'll both have those.
Yeah.
No, hey!
My notes!
This is a birthday party, not a recon mission.
You can get this back at the end of the night.
All right.
Let's go interact with these dummies.
Wait here.
What do you teach?
Comparative historiography Of the French and American revolutions.
Nope.
How 'bout you?
Molecular biology.
Worse.
What do you study?
Abnormal psychology.
So, like, weirdos and freaks.
You should meet my friend.
Hey.
Gina, what are you thinking about right now?
I was thinking how I would make the perfect american president, Based upon my skill set, dance ability, and bloodlust.
That is fascinating.
"ah-shan-ti".
Oh, man, it's black Tom Selleck and white Sidney Poitier.
Come on.
All books and no magazines?
What kind of crappy library's full of books?
A crap library.
All of the magazines are in the bathroom.
Great solve, Peralta.
Ah!
Can I help you?
Captain.
I didn't hear you silently sneak up on me.
Oh, that reminds me, tell Kevin that I am available for brunch On Sunday the 17th.
The 17th is a Tuesday.
Why are you talking about The New Yorker all of a sudden?
I always talk about smart stuff.
You know, the jazz age, what's in a name, The 1950s movies that are from the '50s.
Those were the categories on Jeopardy last night.
Don't try so hard to impress my husband.
Yes, sir.
To the crap library.
April 13th, May 2nd Come on!
Why doesn't my life always work out perfectly?
Uh, just a second!
I'm halfway done!
I'm halfway there, I'm halfway done With what's happening in here.
Okay.
una furtiva lagrima This song gets to me every time.
It's beautiful.
You must be so proud.
I sure am.
How long have you two been together?
We've been partners for almost 30 years.
So do you two ever get harassed at work?
Harassed?
For what?
For being a gay couple who works together in the nypd.
Bu-u-u-ooh Peralta.
Hey, don't you one-minute me.
I will break that finger off.
Hang up that phone.
I'm talking to my credit card company.
I tried to get an online subscription to The New Yorker, And they declined me.
Apparently, based on my previous purchases, They assumed it was fraud.
That's crazy.
I'm fancy.
One time, I had coffee-flavored ice cream.
Shut up!
Okay.
Hang up now.
If you're that desperate, the first two paragraphs Of the article are on the free site.
Hmm.
You have one minute to look it up, And then if I catch you on that phone again Oh, my.
Don't worry.
I'm due for an upgrade, and my babies are on the cloud.
He is so strong.
Ah, thank you.
Lovely party, Kevin.
These tiny pickles are hilarious.
They're called cornichon.
So that New Yorker article about human trafficking We were discussing-- yes, so interesting, Especially the first two paragraphs.
Right, but what did you think of the thesis, Vis-a-vis modern slavery and its undeniable role in the economy?
Good.
If you ask me, the whole thesis was way off base, Vis-a-vis the rest of the article Vis-a-visAmerica.
The article was antislavery.
Are you saying that slavery is good?
You know, I think you're missing the point of the article.
You must not be remembering it right.
Well, I just read it last night as I got in bed.
It's quite fresh in my memory.
Ah.
You know, I would like to hear more of your thoughts.
And I would love to give them to you, But unfortunately, I have got to hit the crap library.
Excuse me one second.
My last meal on earth?
Mm.
That's a great question.
I'd go classic french.
Ortolan.
Tiny songbird, eaten in a single bite, Bones and all in open defiance of god.
It's illegal to consume ortolan, But I actually got academic dispensation to eat one once.
Ohh.
The beak, very crunchy.
That is literally the sexiest thing anyone has ever said.
How are you single?
You're not seeing anyone?
No.
There is nobody in my life.
Sort of a sad thing to wink about, I realize now.
Aren't you supposed to be babysitting Gina?
Doesn't need my help.
She's over there, dazzling some psychologists.
All men are at least 30% attracted to me.
My mother cried the day I was born, Because she knew she would never be better than me.
At any given moment, I'm thinking about one thing: Richard dreyfuss hunkered over eating dog food.
I feel like I'm the paris of people.
Complete overlap of ego and id.
It's been theorized, But I never thought I'd see it.
I'm exquisite.
I can't believe I'm frenching in the closet.
I feel like a teenager!
I feel like I'm 40 again.
Chew on this shiso leaf.
It'll give our kissing Umami flavor.
Delicious.
Time to put my newfound knowledge to the test.
So, sir, popcorn setting, always too short, am I right?
I'm sorry?
On our microwave.
We have the same microwave.
Oh, I didn't buy it.
It came with the house.
Hummus.
Thoughts?
I have no thoughts about hummus.
If you'll excuse me.
Yeah.
Blink twice if you'd like me to mercy kill you.
I thought I had done enough recon, But clearly, I have only scratched the surface.
If I'm gonna bond with him, I have to massively violate his privacy.
But truffaut wrote breathless, And I've always considered movies a writer's medium.
I can't agree.
It's godard's film.
Come on!
I mean, truffaut is also important.
Seriously?
Hold this, I gotta go.
Wow.
Maybe it is truffaut's film.
Mighty dvr, tell me the captain's secrets.
Unveil yourself to me.
Ooh, how it's made: Contact lenses.
Bingo!
What are you doing here?
I--what?
I'm not.
What are you doing here?
I need to find a New Yorker that Kevin left by the bed, So I can justify this whole proslavery stance I've backed myself into.
Detectives!
Sarge!
I see that you, Like I, came up here to chastise Santiago.
Amy, this is low, even for you.
I cannot believe you would both violate The "please stay downstairs" rule, Which was prominently posted!
Get outta here!
I don't know why we have to have this discussion again.
What do we do?
Bathroom!
Bathroom.
Why are you upset with me?
Your employees are the ones putting a damper on the party.
They are acting terribly.
You're the one who's been acting terribly tonight.
You've been curt and snobby with my guests.
You've been needling poor Peralta so much, You've practically made him a new suit.
Needled him a new suit.
Even when we're fighting, you're hilarious.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Oh, no!
Dog, allergies, sneezing.
No!
Get away!
Shh.
Grab the dog!
Look at me.
Do not blow this for us.
You know what, I knew this wasn't going to work.
It never has.
We should've just gone out For dinner to a restaurant, like we do every year.
Why did you make me invite them?
I made you invite them because I like them.
They're good people.
Santiago, are you hiding in my bathroom With a dog that you're deathly allergic to?
No.
Occupied?
Well, this has been a stinky 12 hours.
My computer bag got a hole in the bottom, And my power cord fell out.
Last night was such a disaster.
I wheeze-cried myself to sleep.
Well, at least captain said he liked us, Right before he kicked us out of his house For violating his trust.
Why didn't Kevin want to invite us?
We could have been really cool people.
We weren't, but we could've been.
Well, as soon as he unveiled his "no cop talk" policy, I was sunk.
Gruesome murders are the cornerstone of my charm.
Well, he spent the last 30 years with a cop.
Maybe he's sick of hearing about it.
Wait.
Maybe that's not what he's sick of.
Santiago, you brilliant bastard, you figured it out!
Hello again, professor Kevin Cozner.
What do you want?
I'd like to tell you about a case I solved.
Thank you, but just as with my home, My office has a strict "no cop talk" policy.
I figured, but the case that I have solved Is the case of the "no cop talk" policy.
There were three things that bothered me about last night: You didn't want the nine-nine at your party, Even though you'd never met us, Your friends immediately asked Hitchcock and Scully If they were harassed, And there was something interesting About that photo in your library-- You and the captain were shunted off to the side.
I don't think you dislike cop talk.
I think you dislike cops.
I'm married to one.
I know, and I can't imagine it's been fun Watching the man you love marGinalized, underappreciated, And disrespected by the nypd.
Because he's gay, Raymond has been put through hell By his colleagues, many of whom, Quite frankly, look exactly like you.
Devastatingly handsome?
I'm sorry, I'm uncomfortable with emotions.
So yes, I decided a long time ago That just because I love Raymond Doesn't mean I have to love the people he works with.
Good solve, detective.
Nice cop lingo.
Look, I'm really sorry that we ruined your party.
I'd like to make it up to you.
Captain, thank you for joining us.
What's going on?
A proper birthday dinner.
Amy chose the restaurant.
Captain.
Ah, perfect.
I've always wanted to come here.
Boyle picked the menu.
Vivian helped.
Terry chose the champagne.
I'm sorry about your party, sir.
I tried to keep them in line, but I failed.
Well, that's not your job.
I'm only sorry You didn't get a chance to enjoy yourself.
Gina has brought back all the silverware That she stole from your house.
What?
Also, this clock.
Good heavens.
This isn't ours.
And my contribution will be to refrain From discussing The New Yorker for the rest of my living days.
Enjoy.
Thank you, jake.
You're welcome, Kevin.
Call me "Kev".
Oh.
What?
Oh, he told you to say that, didn't he?
Well, you are always playing pranks on me, Raymond.
Just once, let me be the funny one.
And finally, it is my great pleasure To introduce the nine-nine zone detective Scully To serenade you.
ma n'atu sole cchiu bello, oi ne' o sole mio sta 'nfronte a te This part always gets me.
o sole o sole mio
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Dryin' dishes, yeah.
Man, charles has been so happy and confident Ever since he hooked up with that professor At the captain's party.
She has tenure, and also has ten years, Times two, older than him.
That sucked.
Yeah.
It's nice to see him like this.
he's so confident.
This morning, he finally corrected the barista When she called him "charlize".
He's been living as "charlize broil" for five years.
It's great.
It's all so great.
He could take it down, just a smidge.
if you like pina coladas Dead guy, charles.
Sorry.
But whatever, I can handle the singing.
I'm just so happy for that guy.
It's about time he caught a break.
Sexy train is leaving the station.
Check out this caboose.
Later, sluts.
Just let him have it.
Great job, Boyle.
Peralta, where are we with the black cab holdups?
Well-- I got this, jakey.
Oh, all right.
Have at it, man.
nice jeans, Boyle.
Those are surprisingly low-waisted.
Eyes up here, gina.
I'm more than just a piece of ass.
ooh.
not bad, not bad.
An unlicensed cab driver's been picking up tourists.
Driverakeshe vics down under the b.Q.E., Robs 'em at gunpoint, leaves them stranded.
Unfortunately, because they're tourists, And our perp is not caucasian, We don't have a clear idea of what he looks like.
He was either latino, arabor mican.
Either way, very muslim.
We'll go undercover, dress as out-of-towners, Hope the perp picks us up.
Don't worry, sarge, we'll nail this guy.
I can't believe I was just Briefly attracted to Boyle.
Ugh.
Ugh!
A mr.
Brain jensen here to see you, sir.
It's brian.
Mm, not according to this note I wrote on my hand very quickly: "brain".
Captain holt, we recently met at the african-american Gay and lesbian new york city policeman's association.
Uh, yes, that name is quite a mouthful.
Just call it the "aaglnycpa".
Your organization has meant so much to me.
Uh, well, it's not my organization.
I mean, I did found it and I've been president For the last 25 years and I oversee every detail, But really, it's our organization.
It's yours.
And out of respect for you and everything That you've done, I wanted to stop by And let you know I'll be running for president.
I hate to run against you, But I have some ideas for change that'll Bring aaglnycpa into the 21st century.
I see.
Well, it's been good meeting you.
And, uh, I wish you the very best.
Thank you.
Good-bye, brain.
It's--it's brian.
Very nice man.
Yes, he is.
Now, let's figure out how to Destroy him.
How'd the interview with the victim go?
It went okay.
The guy was from canada, said it was probably His fault for getting robbed, And apologized for wasting my time.
oh, canada.
Truly odie to america's garfield.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, what are you doing tomorrow night?
I think I can get us some nets tickets.
No go, amigo.
Tomorrow is vivi's and my big 20-day anniversary.
I'm pulling out all the stops.
Dinner at le bonbon, With 300 roses at the table.
No.
Oh, man.
Then a gondola ride along the gowanus canal.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
And then, a skywriter's Gonna write, "charles loves v." I couldn't afford her full name.
Okay, first of all, "charles loves v" Means something very specific And, I'm gonna guess, not what you're intending.
But more importantly, you're going full Boyle.
what?
I am not.
What's full Boyle?
Anytime charles gets Into a new relationship, he gets way too intense Way too fast, and it always ends in heartbreak.
We met on the subway, Went out to dinner, and I told her ioveder.
And my mom was so happy.
And then the barbershop quartet I hired started to sing.
And then she broke up with me.
And then she broke up with you.
yes!
Oh, joanna, no!
courtney!
rhonda!
I know when I'm going full Boyle.
Trust me, this is different.
I have it under control.
Gotta go, jakey.
Excuse me.
Are you a detective?
Oh, uh, who's asking?
I'm super dan, Scourge of brooklyn's underworld, And I need to talk to an officer of the law.
I'm busy right now, working on thisExcuse.
I think santiago's free.
Hi.
I'm super dan.
And I have a crime to report.
Oh, gosh, I am so sorry.
I literally just retired.
This is my retirement cake.
Mmm.
Thanks, you guys.
I'm gonna miss this place.
Why aren't you guys taking me seriously?
Your cape and your tights, And your name is super dan, And I can kinda see your penis.
And it's just all a rich tapestry.
Yeah, well, I'm a citizen.
I'm from this neighborhood.
So the only reason I'm wearing this costume Is so when I'm fighting crime,, People will respect my authority.
How's that working out for you?
Detectives, when a citizen comes in off the street, It is nypd policy to take a statement.
This isn't enough of a statement?
Yes, I wanted to inquire About renting out the statue of liberty For a romantic evening.
Mm-hmm.
Is there a bed in the torch?
No?
Okay.
I'll get back to you.
Hey there, charles.
I thought maybe we should have a little chat About how crazy you're acting, And how you're blowing this beyond repair.
Are you really qualified to give romantic advice?
You're not exactly the king of mature relationships.
Fair enough.
But I would argue That I am like a beautiful angel of love, Who has trouble finding love for himself.
Admit that you would see that movie.
I would.
Thank you for honesty.
But this is not about me.
It's about charles.
I've seen this before, buddy, and it is bad.
Jake, I'm nowhere near full Boyle.
Then prove it.
Just push your Anniversary dinner one night.
Say, "vivian, tomorrow doesn't work for me.
Can we reschedule"?
If this will convince you, more than happy.
No problem.
Great.
Voice mail.
God, I love how she says the words, "you've reached".
Hi, vivi.
It's chucklebunny.
Oof.
I'm just calling about dinner tomorrow.
I can't wait to see you, My luscious little breakfast quiche.
I just wanna draw you a bubble bath And spoon-feed you caviar.
I think we should open up a joint checking account.
I love you-- what am I doing?
It's okay.
I hung up right after "chucklebunny".
Help me.
I've gone full Boyle.
I need to focus on my reelection campaign.
Clear my schedule.
You really care about this little club, huh?
It's not a club.
It's an organization That I founded over 25 years ago.
I'm proud to say we now have 50 members.
But it wasn't so easy in the beginning.
I'd like to request discretionary funds, To start an organization supporting black Gay and lesbian police officers.
They never actually said no, So I just went ahead and did it.
I've poured my heart and soul into this organization.
And I'm not gonna just give up the presidency.
You should make me your campaign manager.
I was born for politics.
I have great hair and I love lying.
Find out everything you can about this jensen.
I'll work on my speech.
How's this for an opening joke?
You know what the toughest part about Being a gay black police officer is?
The discrimination.
I believe that's what you call observational humor.
Probably.
That's great.
All right, let's go over our disguise I am herbert goffleman from san diego.
I came here to stand in the cold Outside the today show, holding a sign With a misspelled word on it.
Oh, you know what?
You win.
That neon green fanny pack screams, "gullible tourist".
It's mine.
I brought it from home.
Hey, can I have my phone back, please?
Uh, no, because you will call vivian, And you have the worst case Of full Boyle I've ever seen.
What?
I found this, by the way.
You wrote "mr.
Charles ludley" over a thousand times.
Why would you take her last name, Boyle?
look.
For the last two years, I've been Directing all my love at rosa.
So my emotions just piled up.
And now with vivian, my feelings Are springing out of me like a fire hose.
Oh, that is overtly sexual.
Jake, I'm gonna ruin it.
You gotta help me.
All right, here's the plan.
I'll text vivian from your phone, And tell her you want it to be a double date.
That way, I can come with you and hold your hand.
Well, then your hand will be on her butt, Because my hand will be on her butt.
You gotta get it together, man.
I told you I need help!
Hey, can I get your file On that atlantic avenue drug ring?
Sarge gave me and scully the case.
What?
Oh!
Why did you do that?
I-I know I deserved it, but why?
Sarge, you reassigned our drug case?
Diaz and I have been working it for three months.
Remember super dan?
The guy you ignored and made fun of?
He's been perching on rooftops at night, Secretly taking photos of drug deals.
He has thousands of images And can I.D. The entire network of dealers.
What?
But you refused To take his statement, because he had a cape on.
Luckily, hitchcock and scully didn't mind.
I didn't even notice he was wearing a cape.
You're a cop.
You should've noticed that.
We screwed up.
Message received.
Yep, be nicer to virgins.
She doesn't speak for me.
You're not getting your case back.
Okay.
Here's what I found out about our competition.
Brian jensen, born 1899, Served in the navy during world war I. A hero at the battle of scimitar hill, Jensen perished in a factory fire In the netherlands.
This may be a different brian jensen.
I've never been in this position before.
I've always run unopposed.
If you wanna compete, you're gonna have to have A little more pizzazz.
A couple ideas for ya.
The obvious place to start would be you, In a silver suit, With sunglasses and roller skates-- The candidate of fun.
What's your second idea?
Nada.
Thought I had a slam dunk on the first one.
Hi, there.
We'd like to go to the times square.
We're brothers.
We're all set for the double date tonight.
Vivian's bringing her friend bernice.
Bernice?
That sounds like a cartoon dump truck.
Whatever, that's probably for the best.
I don't need any distractions.
My mission is to protect you.
All right.
Hey, this guy's going the right way.
We should get out and try again.
You can let us off here.
We would like to buy some bagels.
and where is the sex and the city street?
We wanna see where carrie and big live.
I'm a carrie.
I think I'm a carrie.
we're both carries.
All right, let's prepare for the date tonight.
Here's the things you're not allowed to talk about: Love, poetry, music, or passion.
We don't have to talk at all.
I'll just stare into her eyes.
They're like little drops of cilantro reduction On lily-white flan.
Okay, no.
See, no food talk.
It sets off something primal And disgusting in both of you.
It makes me wanna barf.
You're right.
Look, if you feel like You can't handle it, we need a signal.
I'll do this.
And how would you do that naturally?
I don't know.
This guy's clean, by the way.
Can we pull over, please?
there she is.
I don't know if I can do this.
Listen to me.
I am with you all night.
And nothing will distract me From my solemn vow to protect you, okay?
Okay.
Vivian, you look beautiful.
I love your dress.
Aww.
You too, charlie.
You look so handsome.
Steady, steady.
Jake, this is my friend bernice.
Oh, hello.
I'm jak-tractive.
Jak-tractive?
Yes, my parents were hippies.
Let's eat.
Okay, so, jake, You're a cop.
I wanted to be a cop when I was a kid, Mostly because I love die hard.
Die hard, really?
Mm-hmm.
Well, that makes sense, everyone loves that movie.
Oh, not like me.
I sleep in a nakatomi plaza security t-shirt.
oh, no.
What kinda dogs do you like?
I mean, you know, just hypothetically, If we were to get a dog.
Oh, I love all dogs.
When I was a kid, I had the cutest Golden retriever, named rufus.
That is the most amazing thing I've ever heard.
I wanna meet him.
Charles, why don't you tell vivian About the ten-day forecast?
Oh, good idea.
sorry about that.
So if you're not a cop, then what do you do?
I'm in grad school.
I thought about maybe being a sports reporter, But it would be impossible for me to be objective.
I love the nets so much.
You're a nets fan?
I love the nets.
Oh, my god.
This season has been a disaster, right?
Yes.
And everybody blames it onas kidd.
Yes.
But it's like, at a certain point, Billy king is the one who put the team together.
Yes.
wow.
I love rainy days.
My mother loves rainy days.
You should meet her.
Excuse me.
our signal.
Uh, here's a question for the group.
What is the longest funeral you've ever attended?
Ladies first.
on behalf of captain holt: Floorgasm.
hands in the air fist pumpin' like champs hands in the air fist pumpin' like champs hands in the air fist pumpin' like champs fist pumpin' like champs fist pumpin' like champs  did you like it?
It was inspired by the city of new york, In that I stole it from some kids I saw dancing on the subway station.
All of you, go home, immediately.
I appreciate the effort, gina, but I can't risk Losing this election.
The aaglnycpa means too much.
Let me rehearse my speech.
Do you want a president who struggled against all odds To create this great organization?
Or do you want a great nothing Who struggled against nothing odds to create nhing Yikes.
The meeting is beginning.
The stakes are very high for me.
I'm getting nervous.
My stomach is in flux.
You know, in the court of louis xi, Women would only eat consomme, because They were worried that Chewing would give them wrinkles.
I love it when you talk broth.
Hey, charles, remember that dog We found on the train tracks?
Was it inside-out or just very badly burned?
Inside-out.
Yeah, 'cause there were Things on the outside that Definitely should've been on the inside.
Definition of inside-out.
bingo.
Uh, will you excuse us?
Bernice and I are gonna use the ladies' room.
Yeah.
Hurry back.
Oh, no.
Jake, I can't stop looking at her butt.
Yeah, you are definitely making her uncomfortable.
And this beautiful basketball-loving Die hard fan is tearing down my walls of defenses.
If we find out that she is half-jewish, We are all doomed!
I know.
I borrowed the waiter's phone When you weren't looking, and bought me and vivian Plane tickets to rome.
What?
We leave in two hours.
Terrible itinerary, connect through vietnam.
All right, just go home.
Get out of here and regroup.
I'll take care of everything.
I'll tell 'em it was an emergency.
Thank you.
Can you make it a work emergency, Not a bathroom one?
I kinda wanna make ia.
Sarge, you made your point.
We messed up.
But this is a big case, and hitchcock And scully are gonna screw it up.
I'm sure they can handle it.
They have a combined This morning I found scully's gun In the freezer, in the frozen yogurt.
I think he was using it as a spoon.
The truth is, I had to give 'em the case.
You insulted super dan.
He refuses to cooperate with you.
We weren't that bad.
You told him his superpower was being so embarrassing That people laughed themselves to death.
yeah.
For those of you who don't know me, I'm officer brian jensen.
Listen to him talk.
He has no gravitas.
Do you know what gravitas sounds like?
greetings, all.
Details about this organization Should be included in nypd recruitment literature And on the website.
He actually has some good ideas.
Maybe you shouldn't be so quick to dismiss him, Like you were with a certain amazing dance troop.
He isn't fit to be president.
He hasn't spent the last 25 years Fighting to build this organization.
Right.
Is that bad?
I thought you created agla--naca--macapa Or whatever, so people like him Wouldn't have to go through what you went through.
Isn't it a good thing that brian jensen Didn't have to struggle for 25 years Just to get up on this stage?
thank you all for your time.
I hope you vote for me.
Greetings, all.
You know what the toughest part about Being a gay black police officer is?
The discrimination.
What?
At the very first meeting of the aaglnycpa, I was elected president unanimously, Because I was the only member And I voted for myself.
But after 25 years of struggle, I am no longer the only member.
And lookorward to casting my vote For someone else.
That is why I withdraw my name From consideration as president.
congratulations, brian.
If you screw this up, I will impeach you.
I wrote the bylaws, so I know how to do it.
But I'm very happy for you.
But I will impeach you, if necessary.
Anyways, charles wanted me To reiterate how sorry he is, But he got an emergency call.
And that is plausible, because we're detectives.
well, is it a tough case?
'cause charlie was acting so weird tonight.
Mm-hmm.
Work has been so stressful.
Speaking of, here is your coat.
I've gotta run.
If you wouldn't mind using the back exit, It'll be much safer.
Trust me.
I'm a cop.
New york, right?
Charles, what are you doing here?
I'm so close to getting you out of this.
They're putting their coats on.
Funny story-- I was walking home and I passed a pawn shop.
And then I went into a trance.
And now I have this engagement ring.
No, charles!
Well, I'm gonna go ask vivian to marry me.
Bye.
No, give me that.
Jake!
give that back.
I'm doing this for your own good.
You've gone full Boyle.
I'm helping you out.
Give me that ring, or I'm gonna pepper spray you.
Pepper spray me, I will pepper spray you!
Huh?
Mm.
No!
aah!
Crap!
Crap!
Aah, crap!
Crap!
Aw, crap!
Hey, buddy.
Got you that fancy coffee you like.
Nah, I don't want it.
Ah, so expensive.
How you holding up?
Well, jake, I've been better.
Right.
Look, I'm sorry I threw your ring in that boiling pork water.
Yeah.
I'm sorry I pepper sprayed you.
I'm sorry I pepper sprayed you.
It burned like hell, right?
Yeah.
Thank god for that soda.
Ahh, it's so sticky, but it feels so good.
Ooh, cab.
After you.
Yes, sir.
What are you two still doing here?
Isn't your shift over?
There's something we need to take care of.
Oh, super dan, over here.
Thanks for coming.
great.
You two?
If you guys wanna make fun of me, Just come down to pita paradise like everyone else does.
We need your help.
Why?
What happened to scully and hitchcock?
They're busy, cleaning hitchcock's ear.
Yeah.
Did you witness any of these men Selling narcotics?
This is so official.
Yeah, this guy, number three.
That's the mope we brought in.
Yeah, okay.
We're gonna need to take your statement.
Spare no detail.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah!
Okay, um, all right.
Well, uh, I was driving around my neighborhood In the "danmobile," which is my bike.
I know what we did wrong.
Ah, should've followed the rules, But more importantly, we're supposed To help out everyone, no matter what.
That's right.
Nice work on the arrest.
I got vaccinated that year, But then I still got the flu.
whoa.
Don't be bummed, man.
It's gonna be okay.
No, it isn't.
You can't be with me every minute of every day.
I'm in love with this woman, for real.
And I'm gonna go full Boyle and scare her off.
No, we can figure this out, all right?
I still got your phone, so you're good there-- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I think we're gonna get robbed.
I need to pull over.
Flat tire.
Give me your wallets.
Nypd, you're under arrest for armed robbery!
A little to the left, charles.
Yeah, I'm still not seeing great because of the pepper spray.
Hey, cab driver's in the interrogation room.
You ready?
Let's do it.
Oh, no, what's this?
What is this?
I checked your phone.
There were a hundred texts from vivian, Worried about you, A selfie that I can never unsee, And dozens of voice mails.
hey, chucklebunny, it's me.
You disappeared last night.
And you were acting weird.
And I'm worried it's because I'm moving too fast.
I really wanna see you.
And I know it's 3:00 a.M., But we should feed each other falafel In our underwear-- okay.
I know it when I hear it.
She's full Boyle.
Full Boyle for Boyle.
I took the liberty of texting her, And telling her to come meet you here.
I thought you might wanna give her this, Or something considerably nicer.
That is definitely not platinum.
You really think this is a good idea?
Buddy, I honestly don't know, But you're definitely not gonna scare her off.
I say do whatever makes you happiest.
Jakey, you're the best.
ahh.
Your body is trembling like a leaf.
I'm so excited.
yes!
Yes?
Yes!
Aww.
Charles is engaged.
You handled this really well, peralta.
I take back what I said about you being immature.
Oh, apology accepted, fart monster.
Okay.
Ohh.
Oh, no.
Oh, boy.
Okay.
Yeah, this is turning into a live sex show.
Yeah, let's go.
Oh, no.
I wasn't saying it in a bad way.
Jake!
Yep.
Although they can't see us.
-  jake!
- Yep.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
So, again, your alibi is a mysterious stranger handed you the gun, made you put your prints on it, robbed the store, and then hid the gun in your underpants.
Well, yeah, if you say it like that, it don't sound believable.
Oh, hey, captain.
Did you get my report on the Finley murder?
Yeah, I looked it over.
Nice work.
Good.
Thanks, dad.
Why is everyone staring at me?
You just called captain Holt "dad".
What?
No, I didn't.
I said, "thanks, man".
Do you see me as a father figure, Peralta?
No.
If anything, I see you as a "bother" figure, 'cause you're always bothering me.
Hey, show your father some respect.
I didn't call him dad.
No, no, no, no, Jacob.
I take it as a compliment.
I called Vivian "mom" once, and she's my fiancee.
Guys, jump on that!
Boyle has psycho-sexual issues.
Old news.
But you calling Holt "daddy"-- hey, "daddy" is not on the table here.
But you did call him "dad," dude.
All right, all right, I was lying about the holdup.
But the dad thing, that happened.
Aha!
He admitted that his alibi was a lie.
It was a trap, all part of my crazy, devious plan.
I believe you.
Thank you.
Son.
Do you want to talk about it later over a game of catch?
I'd like that.
Thank you for coming in on your day off.
I know you'd all rather be at home, binge watching media content.
Oh!
I just started the second season of media content.
No spoilers.
But these evaluations are important.
Sir, I think I speak for all of us She doesn't.
When I say that we can't wait for you to sit in judgment of us.
Oh, these will be self-evaluations, Santiago.
WhySe.
Very wise, sir.
Nice save.
Also, please stay out of the way of the weekend squad.
They are on duty, and the bullpen is theirs.
I hate the weekend squad.
Detective lohank shaves at my desk and gets hair all over my computer.
My "r" key is jammed with stubble.
Well, that explains the email you sent about the "guesome mude".
Dismissed.
I'm pumped for these evaluations, sir.
I can't wait to hear what you have to say about my squad.
I think they've had a great year.
I feel like a proud mama hen whose baby chicks have learned to fly.
Interesting analogy, sergeant.
Chickens are famously bad at flying.
Yo.
Peralta asked to be first, which shows how seriously he's begun taking his job.
Nope, I just want to get this over with.
So I have 72 arrests, an 80% clearance rate, but most importantly, I wore a tie sometimes.
Now, I have a question for you: Is there any way I can borrow $430,000?
Why on earth do you need that much money?
I need to buy my apartment.
I've been living at my Nana's place since she passed away 'cause it's rent-controlled, but now the building's going co-op, so I have to buy it.
I need to secure a loan by the end of the day.
Uh, so should we do a wire transfer, or do you think cash is easier?
Let's just do cash.
Shouldn't you be asking somebody else for that kind of money?
Like a bank?
Yeah, I tried that.
Jake, I cannot believe you're gonna lose Nana's apartment.
We grew up together.
We used to hang out there every day after school.
That's right, because there was no one to look after us, because our moms both worked, and We didn't have fathers Peralta, I will not give you a cool half mil because you had a slightly sad childhood.
Go solve your housing crisis.
Nana made me the intelligent, sensuous woman I am today.
Weird way to describe a grandma's influence on you.
I'm sorry, Gina.
I don't know that we can spare you.
Um, these are her notes so far.
"Empanadas, Atlantic city, birth control".
No, that's my travel journal.
I haven't started on the notes yet.
You may go with Peralta.
Both: Thank you.
I want to take Vivian somewhere romantic tonight.
How about this?
Graziolo's, for the porco digestivo meal.
It's a culinary tour of a pig's digestive track.
Pig bung gelato for two, anyone?
Uh-oh, heads up.
Weekend crew.
I feel sad for you.
I love my desk buddy.
Sometimes detective kearns and I leave presents for each other.
Well, lohank's a stubble monkey.
I hate him and his face garbage.
Why don't you just tell him to stop shaving at his desk?
He denies even doing it.
I don't know why.
Next time I catch him shaving, I'm gonna punch him so hard in the mouth he bites his own heart.
Could that be why he denies doing it?
Oh, yeah, you could be right.
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
It is always so crazy coming back here.
Remember when Nana got cable?
We watched house party 2 so many times.
It was a pajama-jamma-jam.
We had no choice.
Our hands were tied.
I gotta say, I'm psyched to be hanging like this, old-school stylez.
"Stylez" with a "z".
Oh, I could tell.
Okay, well, maybe we can figure out a way for you to afford this place.
Hup, hup, before we get all financial, can I interest you in an ice-cold foh-dy?
A'ight.
So talk to me, goose.
How we lookin'?
Sexy, but not like we're trying too hard.
Like, sure, we're trying, but it's almost effortless.
Yeah, no, I knew all of that.
I meant the money thing.
Oh.
My first impression is that you have a debilitating spending problem.
Jake, you have six massage chairs.
Well, they don't make a massage couch.
Okay, but you also have three turntables.
Ooh, yeah!
I'm learning how to spin.
Check it out.
All I have are my grandma's old klezmer records, and I still haven't quite figured out how to sync up the beats, but it's not bad, right?
It sounds like joy behar falling down some stairs.
Okay, you also purchased Olympus has fallen on demand 12 times.
Was it a difficult movie for you to follow?
No, just watched it a lot.
How much do I have to cut back in order to keep this place?
Infinity percent.
Technically speaking, you're bankrupt, kiddo.
That sounds bad.
I only said "kiddo" to soften the blow, kiddo.
This is so unfair.
And then all of the sudden, they decide they're going co-op with zero warning?
It seems illegal they didn't tell you this was happening.
Well, it's possible I missed a letter, but I doubt it.
Ooh, let's check the mail tub.
Mail tub?
Nope.
No.
No.
See?
It's impossible to find anything in here.
It's not my fault.
This is actually a cool little bathroom.
Nice claw-foot tub.
Which I will never throw my mail into again.
Unless I didn't want to do this, but I do know one way we could get the money.
You'd make a decent prostitute.
I'd make an amazing prostitute.
But I was actually talking about this guy I know, Frank.
He's kinda skeevy, but he will loan money to anybody.
So he's a loan shark.
Maybe you're not thinking this through.
Says the woman who's been engaged eight times.
Uh, but never married once.
Game, set, match--linetti.
Well, it's the only choice i have.
So let's go.
Sir, I know we got off to a weird start, so to get things back on track, I'd like to bring in Santiago next.
She's had a great year.
You wanted to see me, sirs?
I was reading the sergeant's lips through the window, and he either said, "bring in Santiago next," or something about a San Diego nest.
Are you ready for your self-evaluation?
I am.
I understand from a lip-reading session last week that you intend to ask us each ten questions.
But for you, I have just one question.
What is your biggest Flaw?
My biggest flaw?
Working too hard?
Being too thorough?
Caring too much?
Got it.
Something entirely different.
Rosa, look!
Lohank is shaving right now.
Both, in slow-motion: Noooo!
Boyle, call an ambulance.
I'm gonna do some stuff to him.
Or we give him a taste of his own medicine.
We fill his locker with shaving cream and loose hair.
I like it.
I cannot believe I am considering a non-violent option.
And I know just where to get a bundle of loose hair.
How much interest do you charge?
Look, I'm not a bank.
It's my own personal money.
So I take a larger vig.
A "vig".
So cool.
Well, I don't need much.
Just, like, $430,000.
Nah, too much.
I make small loans to desperate losers.
And friends, like you.
Well, I'm happy this went terribly.
Uh, we do have to go now, so please excuse us.
Wait, I just need enough to show the co-op board I can make a down payment at the bank.
How about $20,000?
Two bags of ziti?
That I can do.
"Bags of ziti"?
Come on, Gina, how awesome is that?
Get on board.
Come on, Gina.
Get on board.
Jake, he is a sea witch in disguise.
Do not sing into his shell.
I have no idea what you're talking about right now.
Oh, little mermaid.
What have you done?
Oh, yeah.
Wow.
Nothing gets you smiling like cold-blooded vengeance.
And now, the piece de resistance.
Emilio's giant bag of hair.
Oh, this is disgusting.
It's perfect.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ooh, check--check this out.
I'm tom Selleck.
Park my chopper on the beach.
I'm a Billy goat.
Oh!
Oh, I think I swallowed a bunch of stranger hair.
Ugh!
Hey.
Mr. henders, the king of the lobby.
Jake, the co-op board meeting was an hour ago.
I know.
I am so sorry.
It's just I've been pretty busy with police work, you know, with my police friends, helping out non-police folk such as yourself, keeping you safe police.
We appreciate your service.
Look, I know there's been a lot of misconceptions about my financial situation, but I am ready to put that to rest right now.
Boom goes the dynamite.
Oh, my God.
That's $20,000 right there, and I intend to use it as a down payment on a mortgage.
Where did you get this money?
Just had it lying around.
You've been an adequate tenant.
Adequate.
But we needed a completed application with a bank loan by today.
With all due respect, sir, that's not fair.
I mean, I didn't even know that the building was going co-op until last week.
I got one letter.
We left you 15 voicemails as well.
Ah, voicemails.
Well, that explains it.
My generation mostly texts.
I'm only 33, so-- we're in the same generation.
I'm 31.
Mm-hmm.
But I call you "mister".
And you wear a suit, and That.
Did you just point at my bald spot?
No.
Look.
We're putting the apartment on the market.
We need to get it ready for brokers to show.
We need you out by next Friday.
Ohhh, next Friday's a little tough for me.
Is there any way we could move it to the Sunday after eight years from next Friday?
Based on your judge-y eyes, I am going to take back my dynamite.
Un-boom.
You got a full head-- head of hair.
Nope.
Okay.
Aw, that bad?
I'm gonna be homeless.
A homeless cop.
It's like a made-for-TV movie that I will not be able to watch because I won't have a television because I'll be homeless.
Chin up, lil' pup.
First of all, you could watch it on your phone.
Second, this isn't the only apartment in the city.
We'll find you a new one.
You're right.
You're right.
This could be good.
I mean, maybe we'll find a great place.
Atta girl.
In a cooler neighborhood.
That's right, girl.
Maybe I'll even have a cute neighbor.
Get it, girl.
You gotta stop calling me girl.
Sorry, girl.
Okay, sirs.
I know why you weren't happy with my self-evaluation.
You didn't want me to say a flaw that was actually positive, like how the sergeant always says it's bad that he works out too much.
Whoa.
Why the drive-by?
Sorry.
But that's not right, because you value honesty and humility above all else.
So what's your biggest flaw?
My biggest flaw.
I'm too competitive, prone to jealousy, "bit of a killjoy, "follow rules to a fault, and every now and then, I smoke a cigarette".
Is that what you're looking for?
Because I can keep going.
I am deeply flawed.
Santiago-- oh, no.
"Santiago" in "b" flat.
You're disappointed.
Okay, well, I'm going to go to a secret location and make sure that nobody is smoking there.
I'll be right back.
Is this a pre-war?
Ah, very good eye.
And you should know it's also pet-friendly.
Really?
Do they allow cats?
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic.
How would you even get a bed in here?
Oh, Murphy bed.
Voila.
Nope.
This is kinda cool.
High ceilings, so many windows.
Gina, the toilet is in the middle of the living room.
I think it's sexy.
Aah!
So when's this going down?
Well, normally, Lohan hits the locker room when he goes to the gym, so let's see when he plans on working out.
So, Lohan, I was reading an article about the benefits of exercise-- you going to the gym today?
Not today.
Been spending all my breaks on the phone with my wife, Nancy.
We've been having marital problems.
Right, 'cause of your hygiene?
What?
No, I wish.
No, about a year ago, she fell down the stairs and broke her back.
Now she's addicted to painkillers.
We've been fighting a lot.
Mm.
'Cause I want to help her, you know?
I guess I just love her so much.
But she's refusing treatment.
Ohhh.
We got into it again last night.
I went out for some fresh air, but I forgot to close the door, and our dog cinnamon got out.
Oh, no.
Cinnamon got hit by a drunk driver.
I wish I could say she was put out of her misery instantly, but the vet assured us that her suffering was unending and terrible.
Just venting a little.
I-I appreciate-- of course.
Anything for a good friend like you.
Charles, can I see you for a minute?
Yep.
My first question is, why are the two of you doing this self-evaluation together?
Scully doesn't handle pressure well.
Um Um Not to brag, but Scully and I have a combined total of 14 arrests.
Would've been 20, but we only got 14.
That's not enough arrests.
Well, no one asked you.
It's a self-evaluation.
Come on, Scully.
I'm trying to hurry, but when you grab the hair, it breaks apart.
The key is you use your hands like scoopers.
Just go-- I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation for this, sir.
Uh, we accidentally dropped all our loose hair and shaving cream in this locker, so we're cleaning it out.
Hasn't detective Lohan been through enough?
He just got diagnosed with prostate cancer.
Course he did.
Clean this up.
Now.
Yes, sir.
What's wrong with you guys?
I've lost control of my squad.
Should we turn some lights on?
Trying to save electricity, Gina.
Your massage chair is on.
Yeah, I'm poor.
I'm not a savage.
Man, what am I gonna do?
Well, what if I bought the apartment?
What are you talking about?
And then I could rent it to you till you find a new place.
How could you afford this place?
Have you been dealing drugs?
No, I'm thrifty.
I cut my own hair.
I walk to work.
I eat Scully's lunch every day.
I've rented the same crap box since I was 20 'cause it's so cheap.
I've saved up money, and I'm looking for a real estate opportunity.
Ew.
A real estate opportunity?
Are you being serious?
We were drinking 40's this morning.
I'm saying I could give you a fair rent because I would be your landlady.
Whoa, whoa, you be my landlady?
You're Gina.
Your lifelong dream is to be on wife swap.
You call gum "the dentist".
You think ray j is a national treasure.
Yeah, so what?
I'm eclectic.
You're not better than me, okay?
And I'm glad that I still own this place because I can happily invite you to leave.
Grow up, Jake.
"Grow up, Jake".
Oh, my goodness.
Yeah, thanks for your help.
Old-school styles.
I take back the "z"!
Whoa, you okay?
Yep.
Just checking out my new bedroom.
Oh, good.
It feels like scoliosis and smells like I take it your apartment thing didn't work out.
When did everyone decide to become an adult?
I mean, I know you were born in your fifties, but come on.
Thanks?
Get this.
Gina just offered to buy Nana's apartment as a real estate opportunity and become my "landlady".
Jake-- I know.
She was just trying to help, but we've known each other since we were kids, you know?
Which an ice cream cone could do, by the way.
And now I find out she's been saving all these years?
Jake-- I know.
The person that I'm really mad at is myself for screwing this whole thing up.
I gotta talk to Gina.
Thanks for your help, Amy.
Didn't say anything, don't want credit yeah, that's smart, given my track record.
Hey, wait.
What would you say Holt thinks my biggest flaw is?
Who care what Holt thinks?
What's most important is what I think your biggest flaw is.
And there are so many to choose from-- too competitive, prone to jealousy, bit of a killjoy, your shame cigarettes.
Oh, my God.
But your biggest flaw is You suck at throwing away your secret lists.
Although I'm pretty sure I caught some form of face lice from that bag of hair.
Being a cop is dangerous.
Yeah, it was fun.
Hey, you wanna grab a drink?
Oh, shoot, I would, but I'm meeting Vivian for that romantic pig colon dinner.
Hey, rosa.
I want to apologize.
I haven't been much fun to hang out with over the last year or so on account of all the asking you out and staring at you from point-blank range.
Yeah, you were a real weirdo.
Mm-hmm.
But you're pretty cool now that you're in love with someone else.
Have a nice dinner.
Oh, we will.
They make a sorbet out of the tail.
See ya.
Excuse me, captain.
What are you doing, sergeant?
I'm going to yell at you, and I don't want Santiago to read my lips.
Excuse me?
You were completely unfair to my squad today.
Santiago is one of your best detectives.
And all you wanted to do was play mind games with her.
Scully and Hitchcock only arrested 14 people, but that's 8 more than last year.
They only arrested And I know Peralta can be childish, but he leads the precinct in collars, and he's grown up a heck of a lot since you got here.
Okay, sit down, sergeant.
I'm going to do your evaluation now.
Sergeant Jeffords, you're right.
I have been hard on the squad.
And just the fact that you're willing to stand up for them is one of the reasons they respect you so much.
I could learn something from you.
You have every right to feel like, um, um, what was it you said this morning?
Proud mama hen, sir.
A proud Mama hen.
What do you want, Jake?
I'm watching Oprah's legends ball, which is what I do every time a close friend hurts my feelings.
I came here to apologize.
Look, I was mad at you for being more together than me, and that's not fair.
I felt stupid, so I acted out.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, you were stupid, and you should be sorry, Jake.
But watching Oprah have brunch with her strong woman friends has taught me that it's okay to forgive.
Great.
Also, you should buy Nana's place.
Not for me.
You should live there.
You love that apartment, and you said so yourself.
It's a great investment.
Where are you gonna live?
Here.
I'll sublet from you.
I actually ran the numbers.
I'd keep paying the same amount of rent, and you would turn a small profit.
It's a starter apartment, and it's my fault for starting when I'm 33.
You have a deal.
All right.
Shake, shake.
Yes!
Hello, detective.
Is there a reason you're interrupting me mid-soup?
Yes.
I'm ready for my self-evaluation.
So I asked Peralta what you thought my biggest flaw was, and he said, "who cares what Holt thinks"?
That's not surprising.
He's very disrespectful.
My biggest flaw is that I care too much what you think of me.
I should be more confident in my own judgment, and I am so sure of that, I don't even care if you think I'm right.
Evaluation over.
Enjoy your soup.
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
For you.
And you.
And you.
What are these?
These, madam, are STDs.
What are you talking about, buddy?
STDs.
Save the dates.
For Vivian and my wedding.
Ah, yes.
Hey, just out of curiosity, how many people have you given STDs to?
Lots.
Like 100.
What's going on?
Uh oh, okay.
I get it.
"STD" has another meaning.
You're gross.
No one else is gonna think that.
Everyone is going to think that.
But it's sweet that your mind didn't go there.
Thank you.
It is kinda sweet.
Will your first dance be to you give me fever?
Will you be serving crabs at the reception?
Do you have herpes?
Guys, this is my wedding.
This is important to me.
No more jokes.
You're right, and we're sorry.
We love you, buddy.
Warts and all.
Sorry, I made a rash decision.
I was itching to say it.
Okay, I'm done.
I have an STD.
So just RSVP, or Yeah, the number's right on there Great.
Thank you.
Whoo!
Happy Tactical Village Day.
Happy Tactical Village Day.
Happy Tactical Village Day.
Peralta, I'm surprised to see you so excited about departmentally mandated training exercises.
It's the most fun day of the year.
Something you wouldn't understand, because you're not programmed to feel joy.
Yes, but my software is due for an exuberance upgrade.
You know, when you play along with the robot jokes it kind of ruins my enjoyment of them.
Yes, I know.
Anyways, Tactical Village Day is awesome.
We get to field test a bunch of cool, new weapons, and there's always a new training situation.
Last year's was prison break.
It got super violent.
It's like being in an action movie.
It's also a good opportunity for us to let off steam and bond as a unit.
Everybody gets into it.
Needless to say, the nine-nine has never had a perfect run.
True, but Jake has been the finalist for coolest kill two years in a row.
That's every precinct sending around their footage and all the cops voting.
It's not that big of a deal.
All you win is a children's karate trophy, so You desperately want it, don't you?
So badly.
I will stop at nothing to get that trophy.
I'll shoot you all in the face if I have to!
Go team.
Gina, the D.A. needs copies of our interrogation transcripts from the Adams case.
Gina?
Gina.
Gina.
Sorry.
I was playing Kwazy Cupcakes.
Crazy cupcakes?
"Kwazy" with a "w".
A backwards "w".
No such thing as a backwards "w".
Yeah, there is.
See?
Okay, how you play You just line up three cupcakes with the same color frosting Ka-bam.
And this little game of yours, it's more interesting to you than your work?
Yeah.
Kwazy Cupcakes is a lot more interesting than this.
Stop saying "kwazy".
And stop playing this inane garbage.
It's embarrassing.
Say it to my face.
I did.
You were looking at your phone.
Oh, cool.
My B. Great news, I think I figured out my persona for this year' tactical villa..
Introducing Rex Buckingham British secret agent, ballistics expert, and ladies' man.
Yeah, 'cause what woman doesn't love a guy who's super into make-believe?
This whole training simulation is make-believe.
We shoot paint at fake bad guys.
It's called acting.
Tell me how I'm any different than George Clooney.
He has a sexy voice.
I have a sexy voice.
Champagne.
Mountain range.
Hugs.
"Mountain range"?
I couldn't think of anything sexy to say.
What?
Mountain range, it's the sexiest geological feature.
No, wait, sorry.
Deep sea trench.
I think I'm gonna go talk to Rosa.
You try to think of some sexier words.
Jesuit.
Horticulture.
Lam-buh.
What is going on with you two?
Come on, Boyle, not this again.
You gotta admit there's a spark.
How many times do I have to say it?
She's like a sister.
That's what Luke said about Leia.
Hey, Luke didn't know!
No one knew!
Okay, Stella.
All right.
Oh, no, no problem.
Okay, all right, bye.
Damn!
Our babysitter's busy the night of Boyle's wedding.
She's gonna be in her High School talent show.
Which she's gonna lose, unless her talent is leaving potato chip crumbs all over Terry's couch.
Wait, Boyle set a date already?
Yeah, he gave out save the dates yesterday.
He didn't give you one?
I think he's been avoiding me.
Hey.
Uh-oh, I hate pizza!
He didn't invite me to his wedding, and he's scared like a little bitch.
Well, maybe Vivian was uncomfortable with you coming.
Look, Boyle was in love with you until a few weeks ago.
Oh, don't be angry.
I'm not angry.
I think it's funny.
One hot pile of boring coming in.
Thank you, Gina.
Dismissed.
You're dismissed.
What you doing in here?
Nothing.
Okay, cool, can I just see your phone for a second?
I may have been playing Crazy cupcakes.
Okay, Captain, I think we're past the point of you being too proud to say the "w".
Fine.
I might have been playing Kwazy Cupcakes.
It's so addictive, right?
I play so much that when I close my eyes at night, I just see cupcakes now, instead of my normal dizzying array of flashing lights.
Yes, well, I have a tremendous amount of self-control.
I don't think I'll have any problem resisting this silly game.
As a matter of fact, I've deleted the application.
There.
Hmm.
Does this mean I've lost my progress?
Well, doesn't matter, because I'm done.
The nine-nine is in the village.
Nine-nine!
Hey, Ronnie.
They upgraded you from bystander to perp.
That's great, man.
Thank you.
I'm gonna blow your brains out.
Amy Santiago.
Teddy!
Hey.
Oh, my God.
It's been so long.
What are you doing here?
I'm with the eight-two now.
We're paired with you today.
Yeah.
Quick.
10-54L.
Ambulance case.
Severed limb.
What is going on here?
Teddy and I met at code camp.
It was a voluntary refresher course on police codes.
Some long nights of intense memorizing.
It was pretty dope.
Sounds dope.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Well, I'm gonna go sign in, but we should catch up later.
Yeah.
Great seeing you.
You too.
Who's that guy?
Uh, that was Teddy.
We went on, like, five dates last year.
I liked him, but he was stationed out in Queens, so I never got to see him, and it sort of fizzled.
Right, that's the guy you said the lame stuff about.
Like "he's a good listener".
I'm sorry, what do you look for in a guy?
I don't know, real stuff.
Shape of his ass.
All right.
So weird that Amy dated that guy.
What do you care so much?
Okay, first of all, your insinuating voice is way too high.
It's creepy.
And second, I don't care.
I'm just curious why she would like him.
Whatever you say.
Oh, yeah, no, I hear it now.
Yeah, I sound like Meryl Streep from Mamma Mia.
Oh, this is so cool.
You can shoot around corners.
I love guns.
I'm gonna make such a good dad.
Not even gonna touch that.
The Amy Santiago story.
Santiago.
Got one for ya.
Roving gang, specify direction of travel and number in group.
At least make me work for it.
Hey, I got one.
How 'bout 10-69?
That's easy.
Message received.
And simultaneously given.
Am I right?
Up top.
Got it.
Yeah.
So they got the new handguns in.
You want to check 'em out?
Totally.
Of course.
Oh, I see what happened.
I thought he was talking to me.
And he clearly was.
Chop chop, Ted.
Let's roll.
Hold down the fort.
Uh That's a P.U.W. Or a portable ultrasonic weapon.
It emits a focused beam of sound which can disorient and even incapacitate a perp.
So it shoots sound?
Mm-hmm.
Is this the trigger?
Yes, but you want to be careful with that.
Ahh ah Thought it would be louder.
It's highly directional.
If it were pointed at you, you'd be in incredible pain right now.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh Why is this happening?
I can taste my thoughts!
Enough, Diaz.
Oh, my God That's pretty cool.
Captain Holt?
Have you seen Captain Holt?
Tall, handsome gentleman dressed like an airline pilot?
No.
Okay.
Your pants are up.
I'm coming in.
Captain Think you might have a little bit of a problem here, boo.
I have this under control.
You should leave.
This is the men's room.
This is no longer a men's room.
It is now a liar's den.
I am Captain of this precinct, and you are my assistant.
I have given you a direct order to leave.
I do not have a problem!
If I want to play Kwazy Cupcakes, I will play Kwazy Cupcakes!
"Kwazy" is a difficult word to say in anger, I think I've made my feelings clear.
Nice.
Have you noticed they moved the trigger?
Real exciting finger feel.
"Finger feel"?
Really?
Nice!
Two to the chest.
Textbook shooting.
Yeah, and his overalls fell down.
I can't believe you would kill a farmer, the backbone of our nation's economy.
May I?
When it comes to shooting patterns, I like to go PB&J.
Penis, brain, jaw.
Nice shooting, man, but do you think the penis is an effective target?
A man can run half a mile with no genitals.
That's a weird thing to know a lot about.
Hey, hey.
Okay, so I know you're pissed at Boyle.
I told you, shooting him with that sonic cannon was an accident.
It's not just that.
Aah!
Oh!
Ahh!
Oh!
Whoops.
Sorry.
Net gun.
My cafe con leche!
Aah!
Sorry.
Misfire.
Right in my breasts!
So many accidents.
Look, I get it if Vivian doesn't want me to come.
But Boyle should've said something.
We're supposed to be friends.
We're finally getting along.
Talk to him.
That's what friends do.
Nope, I'm gonna wait till I'm on my deathbed, get in the last word, and then die immediately.
That's your plan for dealing with this?
That's my plan for dealing with everything.
I have 77 arguments I'm gonna win that way.
Seems like a bad plan.
Now I have 78.
Rex Buckingham at your service.
That was majestic.
Custom kneepads to help me win coolest kill.
What, don't tell me old Buckingham is the only chap here with a signature move.
Uh, no.
I'm working on a thing where when I'm out of ammo I release my mag and dropkick it straight into someone's throat.
Oh!
My buttholes!
Ooh Okay, I know you have two bullet wounds in your butt, but you've gotta stop calling them your "buttholes".
You know how people hold their guns sideways to look cool?
It got me thinking.
What if you held your gun upside-down?
You can use that.
That will never happen, my American friend.
Eight-two's done.
Heads up.
Hey.
How'd it go?
It went well.
We had a perfect run.
And not to brag, but I think we just set an NYPD course record for time.
Definitely a brag.
A course record?
That is so cool.
Oh, thanks.
I'm psyched.
Hey, good luck in there.
Thanks.
All right.
All right, huddle up.
This is how it's going down.
What happened to your accent, Rex?
Forget that crap.
We're taking this seriously.
All right, on three.
Let's break that course record and be the best precinct here.
Ready?
One, two, three!
Let's break that course record and Yeah, I agree, it was too many words.
Let's do it!
Okay, I've got the details for this simulation.
A group of armed men entered an embassy and have taken hostages.
Which embassy?
Doesn't matter.
Fine.
Canada, then.
So take out the perps, clear the civilians, rescue the hostages?
Affirmative.
This is an active shooter situation.
You're cleared for maximum engagement.
"Maximum engagement"?
What is this, The ride?
Diaz and Boyle, perimeter security.
Me and Boyle?
Yeah.
Just the two of you.
Peralta and Santiago, you're the assault team.
I'll be in the command center.
Scully, I want you to do nothing.
Just stand next to me and say, "yes, sarge".
Okay, sarge.
Come on, man.
All right, focus up.
We got 18 minutes, 41 seconds to break this record.
No screwing around.
Whoa, you're really not gonna do a character?
What about Rex "Bookinghame"?
Okay, never, ever do an accent again.
And I am playing a character: A no-nonsense Detective whose only goal is to set this course record.
His name is Vic Kovac.
He's an ex-navy seal who is double-crossed and left for dead.
I don't have time for his back-story.
Sarge.
Okay, guys, and go!
Captain.
Captain.
Captain.
Sorry.
I'm just about to enter sprinkle city.
They break the game into these idiotic worlds to give you some false sense of progress.
So just stop playing.
But I'm just about to enter sprinkle city.
Gina, I've got a problem.
This game is starting to affect my work.
Numbers three and four, switch places.
Cupcake match.
I don't understand why I can't stop.
I've never had a problem controlling myself.
Do you know I love milk?
Mm, no.
Well, I do, but it hurts my stomach.
So I haven't had milk, a beverage I love, for 19 years.
but for some reason I can't quit Kwazy Cupcakes?
I know what to do.
Hitchcock.
You ever play Kwazy Cupcakes?
I love that game!
I just got up to sprinkle city.
Oh, my gosh.
Interesting.
What level are you on, Captain Holt?
Sprinkle city.
We have so much in common.
Look at that, I'm cured.
Turn around!
Clear!
Clear.
Clear.
Nice.
Okay, only three perps left.
We might actually do this.
I like Vic Kovac so much more than Jake Peralta.
Oh, yeah, Kovac.
Let's, uh, find the man who stabbed my sister and get revenge for ruining my life and everything.
You were double-crossed and left for dead.
I can't believe you remembered that.
I also can't believe I didn't go with the sister stabbing.
Emotionally, that is much richer.
Peralta, we got intel there's a hostage in room 409.
Copy that.
I love how it always smells like fresh paint here.
Reminds me of how often I moved as a child.
No talking.
You'll give away our position.
Look out!
Come on!
That was close.
There's paint in your hair.
Okay, here it goes.
I'm pissed at you.
Oh, boy.
I thought I wanted to do this on my deathbed, but apparently I could die randomly in some hallway somewhere, so You didn't invite me to your wedding and it hurt my feelings.
I thought we were friends.
I'm sorry.
It's just Vivian thought it might be weird to invite you because I used to be, you know, all-consumed by my passionate love for you or whatever.
It's okay.
I understand.
Hey, thanks for shooting that guy.
Hey, my pleasure.
Your pleasure?
This was a human being you just killed.
Bill "perp" had a family.
Oh!
Whoa!
Hostages are in there.
Intel says there's a couple of heavily-armed perps with them.
You want to wait for backup?
No time.
We only have a minute 12 to beat the record.
I'm going in.
Don't worry.
I have a plan on how to beat them.
Give up.
What?
Trust me.
Or don't.
I'm doing it anyway.
NYPD!
Don't shoot!
I'm here to surrender.
Let the hostages go and take me instead.
Not happening.
Drop the weapons!
All right, all right, my fingers are off the triggers.
I'm just gonna slowly put them down in front of me.
Slowly put 'em Oh!
Damn it!
Terry, time!
You broke the record!
Yes!
Nice!
Well done.
All in a day's work, elderly lady.
All in a day's work.
Ah, there he is!
Yeah!
The record is ours.
That's so amazing, Jake.
Check it out.
I got us prizes.
Sweet.
"Victim".
I can't believe your final kill came with Scully's move.
You went upsy-downsies?
That's what I call it, because you hold the gun upside-down.
Yes, Scully, I went upsy-downsies.
And none of you will ever speak of it again.
But I want to speak of it.
You looked really dumb.
Man, I feel so good.
Almost makes me want to start taking things seriously all the time, but them I'm like, "boobs, fart, boobs, whatever".
Alright, let's go.
Drinks are on me.
Nice!
Here we go, nine-nine!
Actually, Teddy asked me to get dinner, so maybe I can meet up with you guys afterwards?
Oh.
Neat.
Yeah.
Of course.
Cool.
Boobs.
Fart.
Boobs, whatever.
So I just talked to Vivian.
I told her I really want you to come to the wedding, and she said okay.
Thanks.
I'm excited to go.
Also, "STD" stands for "sexually transmitted disease".
That is correct.
It is, however, very expensive to reprint those cards, so we're leaning into it.
Rosie Diaz, will you accept my STD?
I look forward to having it forever.
Mm.
Well, congratulations, everyone, on a perfect run.
And a new course record.
And congratulations to you, Captain, on beating your Kwazy Cupcakes addiction!
Captain Holt!
Okay, I had to tell them.
It's my nature.
You helped me today, so I'll give you a pass on embarrassing me publicly.
Thank you.
I feel that the reason I was so vulnerable to this game was because technology has evolved to the Yeah, I don't know.
I think it's just bright and stupid and fun.
So fun.
So fun.
So fun.
What's going on, Vic Kovac?
What do you think Amy sees in Teddy?
So you do like her.
I'm just curious.
I mean, I guess he's okay-looking.
And he's a good cop.
They're both kind of dorky about police stuff.
Also, he set the course record, but that's nothing.
I broke it, like, 20 minutes later.
You want to know why she went out with him and not you?
Yeah.
Because he actually asked her out.
Hey, Vivian.
Rosa.
I'm here to celebrate with the team.
Look, I'm not really good at this stuff, but Thank you for inviting me to your wedding.
I'm really happy I could come, and I promise it won't be weird at all.
Yeah, I'm really happy you could come too.
'Cause I didn't think it was gonna happen.
What do you mean?
Well, Chuck told me you were gonna be out of town that weekend, and then, you know, he just told me that your plans changed, so, uh so yeah, so that's great news.
Why would it be weird?
Um, it'd be weird 'cause I'm weird.
Oh.
Whooo I'm leaving.
Night, everyone.
Hey, Amy.
Check it out.
No way, you won coolest kill?
Not even close.
It turns out anyone can just buy themselves a children's karate trophy.
Smart.
Yeah.
Hey, before you go, I wanted to ask you something.
Of course.
I was just wondering Are you wearing lipstick?
Yeah, I'm going out with Teddy again.
Does it look weird?
I called my 13-year-old niece for makeup tips, but I don't know if I trust her.
She is so sexual.
You look great.
Thank you.
So what's up?
Oh.
It's not important.
I just had a question about a work thing.
But have a great date, and we'll talk tomorrow.
Okay.
Bye.
Bye.
I'll help you with your work stuff, Jakey.
Perfect.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
All right, gang, Diet Day Four.
How's everyone holding up?
Honestly, I'm going to last forever.
You hear that, bitches?
I'm gonna last forever  I'm doing great.
This morning the homeless guy on my stoop said my skin looked dope.
What's going on?
Why do you all have matching bags?
We're doing a diet together.
My wife found it.
She heard about it at Mommy And Me Graphic Design.
Wait, it might've been Toddler Karate.
She takes our little ladies to so many classes, I can't keep it straight.
Childhood is truly a time of wonder.
This diet is very scientific, sir.
All the meals are pre-planned and delivered to your doorstep.
This is our breakfast: An orange wedge, three cashew nuts and a solitarie grape.
It's actually more than you realize.
Sometimes I can't even finish all the grape.
This seems unnecessary to me.
You're all in perfect shape.
You can always be healthier, sir.
And I like the challenge.
Plus, it's good team building.
We're gonna get through this together.
Hey, guys, pro tip.
Lick the baggie.
There's food molecules in there.
Oh.
Oh, that's so smart.
Mmm.
What are you doing here?
Isn't it your day off?
Yeah, stalker.
It is my day off.
But I am here to meet Charles.
Did you hear what he did last night?
Drink it, Jake.
Drink it.
What's up your tiny sleeve?
Oh!
Why is there a bow tie in here?
Wait a minute.
Jake Peralta, will you be my best man?
Yes.
Yes!
A thousand times, yes!
Wow.
Best man.
So are you gonna set up shop in a strip club?
What kind of shop would I set up?
Hand sanitizer.
I would sell hand sanitizer.
And no.
I was hoping that my best-man duties would be all whiskey and cigars, but this is Charles we're talking about.
So we've got two straight days of wedding planning, plus, he gave me this to prep.
Fancy Brudgom!
It means "fancy groom" in Danish.
According to Charles, the Danes throw the most beautiful weddings in the world and the most violent funerals.
This does not look like something you'd be into.
Normally, yes.
But I am now Charles's forlover "best man," Danish.
So it is my duty to support him, no matter what weird, crazy, Charles-y ideas he has.
Let's do this.
There he is!
My groom!
Hello, my big, beautiful B.M.!
"Best man".
Just "best man" is fine.
I hope you're rested.
We're gonna be on our feet all day.
I am totally prepared.
I even bought some nurse shoes.
I love them!
Mm-hmm!
Let me grab this!
Let me grab this!
- Let me grab this!
- Grab me!
First stop, kagesmagning!
Cake tasting!
Wow.
You wanted to see me, sir?
I understand you stopped by the patrol officers' morning briefing.
Yeah.
Officer Deetmore helped me out with my crime scene, so I gave him a little thank-you present.
Hey, Deetmore.
If you're gonna bag evidence like a five-year-old, you should have the proper tools.
It's a "My First Police Kit".
The walkie-talkie blows bubbles.
Hope you can handle it.
He mislabeled the weapon, like an idiot.
And it almost got filed with the wrong case.
He could've blown months of work!
You humiliated Officer Deetmore in front of his peers.
He submitted an official complaint against you.
Did he fill it out in crayon?
No.
But he did use a green pen, which seems crazy to me.
The good news is, if you go down there and apologize, he'll let the whole thing go.
Fine.
I'm great at apologizing.
I'm a very sweet person.
Out of my way, Chunk.
Ooh!
Jake, I got to tell ya, the engaged life is amazing, - especially sexually.
- Well, I don't want to pry.
- You're not prying.
I want you to know this.
- No.
Vivian and I have a wonderful intercourse itinerary - that we have planned.
- Ah, ha!
I'm usually more of a chocolate guy, but this one's closer, so I'm gonna do that.
Oh!
Hot, hot!
Spicy cake!
Why?
That's habanero pepper frosting, because our marriage is going to Sizzle Unless you think it's a bad idea.
No.
Sounds like a great idea, Oprah.
Two One.
Okay, be kind.
I don't have a model's body like you.
Come on, show me what you got.
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly.
Liberace, Diane keaton.
Roger that.
God.
Charles, Charles.
You're not Scottish.
Yeah, get back in there, Braveheart.
Summer linen suit casual but classic.
Actually not bad.
One question can you see my underwear?
Ah, thong!
Why are you wearing a thong?
It's my something borrowed.
Get back in there.
Yes!
Lunchtime.
Wait's over.
- That was easy.
- Totally.
I feel like we just had our snack an hour and 17 minutes ago.
I never got into diets Though I did take diet pills in the '70s.
I love these pills.
They give me so much energy.
And I can eat whatever I want.
Oh, God!
He's dead!
Actually, I was in a coma.
When I woke up, I had so much mail.
Weight-loss science has come a long way since then.
Mm-hmm.
"Ingredients carrot".
Got to respect that.
Damn, Gina!
What is that?
Oh, it's a sloppy Jessica.
Mac 'n' cheese, chili, pizza on a bun.
It's everything I've wanted to eat for the last 48 hours.
Mmm.
Mmm.
What happened?
I thought you were gonna "last forever, bitches"!
Turns out I gave up easy.
You hear that, bitches?
I gave up so easy!
Thank you!
Hey, are you sure it's a good idea to eat all this shawarma right before your tux fitting?
Oh, yeah.
I'm not gonna be one of those grooms who doesn't eat.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.
Thanks for being so supportive all day.
Best man whatever you need, I will do.
Actually, there is one thing.
Do you have a pen I could borrow to sign these forms?
You bet I don't have a pen.
I never do.
But I will get you one.
What is it, some sort of marriage license thingy?
Oh, no, it's my retirement paperwork.
What?
Shut up.
What?
Yeah.
Vivian got a job in suburban Ottawa.
She wants me to retire from the NYPD and go with her.
Retire?
Boyle, we're supposed to die on the force together me in a big explosion, and you committing suicide at my funeral out of respect.
I know.
But Vivian needs to make this move for her career, and I'm excited to go.
I mean, suburban Ottawa's great.
It has everything Brooklyn does.
- Really?
- Yes Other than my job and my friends and my family, you, interesting people, museums, restaurants, every other reason that I have to live.
Okay, I'm kind of picking up on a couple of clues that you maybe don't want to retire in Canada.
Oh, my God.
Jake, you're such an amazing detective.
I don't want to go.
Okay, Boyle, let's strategize on how you're gonna tell Vivian that you don't want to move to Canada.
No, Jake, I'm not gonna say anything.
Just drop it.
We have the perfect relationship.
We've never fought.
I don't want to mess up and ruin it.
She's my everything.
- Move your testicles to the left.
- 10-4.
She's your fiancee.
You can't be scared to talk to her.
Testicles to the right You know, can we actually cool it on the testicles for a minute?
No, I'm on the testicle part.
Honestly, Jake, I wouldn't even know how to bring it up.
What if it goes badly?
It won't.
Just tell her how you feel.
Say something like, "Vivian, I love you, but we need to talk about Ottawa".
Right.
And then she'll say, "you're a selfish man-pig, and I hope you die alone, and I never loved you".
Oh, God.
She never loved me.
She's not gonna say any of that because she's not criminally insane.
Okay, just calm down.
We'll think of something together.
We're going to the stationery store next.
We can write a bunch of stuff down.
It's gonna be all right.
Take a deep breath.
No deep breaths.
Makes the testicles clap.
Mm.
Detective Diaz.
How's your apology to officer Deetmore coming?
I've been working on a letter to send him.
Yes, I saw a draft of it on your desk.
What did you think?
It was so horrifying, I had to destroy the whole pad.
Just go downstairs and apologize.
Fine.
I'll say, "I'm sorry".
No, be sincere, like this - I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
Good.
That's the one.
Still working on that afternoon almond?
I've been sucking on it so long, it's smooth.
- It's like sea glass.
- You do you.
I'll get that for you, Ames.
Oops!
Butter feet sorry about that.
Sorry?
You bumbling son of a bitch!
You just ruined my life!
I hope you get hit by a truck and a dog takes a dump on your face!
Nothing to see here just a little hypoglycemic rage.
Move along.
I'm so sorry, Hitchcock.
That's not me.
I'm never like that.
That's okay.
It was my fault.
I shouldn't have bumped your cashew.
Cashew?
It was an almond, you idiot!
I hope you drown in a tub!
I hope you have aneurysm after aneurysm after aneurysm!
Okay, buddy.
We have got some great opening lines here, three very reasonable explanations as to why you don't want to go to Canada, and four very attractive options for your invitation card stock.
Well, I like " Romantic Opening 'C.
' " this page about how my life is New York, and I love the Chantilly Ecru paper for place cards.
That is an excellent choice.
Those are all excellent choices.
You can do this.
You're a smart and wonderful man.
With fantastic handwriting.
Sure, with fantastic handwriting.
You really think so?
Yeah, I think that you could be a professional calligrapher.
Charles, a professional calligrapher.
You can do anything, including, but not limited to, talking to Vivian.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Look, I know it's gonna be hard.
And she might even get mad at you.
But I promise you will be back to doing weird sex stuff together in no time.
All right.
All right, I'm gonna go talk to Vivi.
Great idea, buddy!
Eh?
- Yep!
- Yeah!
So who's gonna pay for the paper?
It's gonna be $250.
Her name is Amy Santiago.
Lick, lick, lick.
It's an ice cream cone.
You can't tempt me, traitor, not when I got this big, juicy cantaloupe wedge to keep me company.
It's so thin I can see through it.
Santiago!
Come hold this so it looks bigger in your tiny hand.
Aw, Amy left the building That doesn't make sense.
Santiago loves cantaloupe time.
We wrote a song about it.
Cantaloupe Cantaloupe It's just nonsense without her singing the high parts.
Where is she?
Amy, where are you?
It's cantaloupe time!
Santiago!
Stop!
It's not too late.
I failed, Sarge.
This is my second burger.
Okay, I lied.
It's my fourth!
You both betrayed me.
That's okay.
I can do this all on my own, I don't need you!
I can even sing the high parts!
cantaloupe  yes, I can  cantaloupe  yes, I can Traitors!
Officer Deetmore I came down here to say I'm sorry.
Oh, good.
Go ahead.
No, that was it.
I did it.
I said, "I'm sorry".
Hey, I said it again.
Now I got one in the bank, so I can do whatever I want to you.
What are you even sorry for?
Come on, man.
I said the words.
I paused afterwards.
I even averted my gaze to make you feel like the Alpha.
Yeah, but you didn't mean it.
I'd like you to apologize like you mean it.
Fine.
I'm sorry you screwed up my case.
I'm sorry you're a terrible cop.
I'm sorry for your goat face and your rodent brain and your weird goose body.
I meant all of that.
Hope you feel better.
Hey!
So?
How'd it go with Vivian last night?
Great.
It went so great.
I went to her apartment.
I sat down face-to-face.
Then I panicked and totally bailed.
Oh, no.
But the good news is, she's on her way here, - and you're gonna talk to her for me.
- Oh, no.
Just tell her I absolutely shouldn't retire and move to Canada, but don't tell her I think that.
- Hi!
- Hi, Vivian!
Mwah!
Hi, Jake!
Vivian!
Jake, you're so sweet!
Charles told me you insisted that I come to breakfast.
Because of it being such an important one.
Meal, I mean.
You know that in ancient Egypt, the peasants drank beer for breakfast?
Well, that explains why all their buildings were crooked.
Charles, can I see you in the bathroom for a second?
I've got a mole on my back that needs a looking-at, and Charles has eyes.
I do.
All right, so let's see that mole.
What?
Get off of me!
That was a fake excuse.
Of course.
Totally.
Look, I can't talk to Vivian for you.
This is crazy.
I tried talking to her, just like we practiced.
But every time I bring up Ottawa, she says how excited she is about our future.
Then we made love.
Don't say "made love".
Fine, we had wonder-sex.
I don't want to know what that is.
I don't want to move to Canada.
But I can't lose her.
You're my best man.
Please help me.
Fine.
I'll try.
Okay, but bring it up naturally, so she doesn't think I put you up to it.
Sure.
How hard could that be?
I'm constantly talking about suburban Ottawa.
Wait, don't go!
I still have to pee.
Why would I stay for that?
Is it cool if I just stare at your croissants for a little while?
Sarge!
You need to stop this diet.
Amy and I folded.
You won.
It's not a competition.
We were on the same team, until you deserted me for team eating food!
Was that a good burn?
I'm too hungry to tell.
It was a great burn, sir.
Now please eat.
You look weak.
I'm fine.
I am stronger than ever!
Watch this.
Sarge, what are you what are you doing?
No, no, no, no, no.
No!
Wow.
See?
I'm fine!
What is happening?
Just a tummy gurgle.
Diet messed up my system.
Oh, no.
Go back inside!
Are you talking to us or the fart?
So, Vivian, do you ever go watch hockey?
No, I'm not one for sports.
Of course you're not.
My graduate student told me the craziest story about her family.
That's hilarious!
Hey, can you pass me the maple syrup, please?
Speaking of, where does the best maple syrup come from again?
Vermont.
Oh, and Canada.
Canada?
Hey, that reminds me.
Weren't the two of you talking about maybe moving there?
Oh, yeah, we are so excited to start this new chapter of our lives together.
Yeah.
Well, although I have to say, as someone who's read many of the older chapters in Charles's life, I wonder if that's the best thing for him.
That's so sweet of you to care, but Chuck is excited about moving to Canada, right, baby?
Mm, mouth full.
I love you.
But what about his job and all of his friends and his Brooklyn-based pizza blog?
Do they even have pizza in Canada?
Yes, it's puffier, and it's sweet.
It's called Manitoba Sauce Cake.
Okay, there's no way Charles wants that.
Jake, I think you're overstepping here.
Charles and I both want to move to Canada.
Is that true, Charles?
Is that what you want?
Uh, yeah.
I want to retire from the force and move to Ottawa with Vivian.
And frankly, I have no idea why you're getting involved.
And no one asked for your stupid opinion.
Vivi We're leaving.
What?
Detective Diaz I gather that, once again, things did not go well with Officer Deetmore.
All due respect, sir, it's how I was trained.
You mess up, you get made fun of.
It's like scientist zapping a rat when it messes up in a maze.
Oh, I get it.
When I was a young officer, I was that rat and got zapped.
And all I wanted was to be captain and throw some lightning bolts.
Emperor Palpatine.
I do not know who that is.
But a real leader doesn't zap people when they mess up.
They teach them how to fix the problem.
I think you're a leader.
So act like one.
I'll try.
I'm sorry.
Please, Diaz.
No need to make a scene.
- I can't believe he's moving to Canada.
- I know.
And I tried to help him, and he fully threw me under the bus.
So I quit as best man.
- Jake.
- What?
I did everything right.
I was loyal.
I put up with all his dumb ideas, his spicy cake, his champagne made out of olives, reading his vows as a recipe.
"One teaspoon eternal love, a dash of peeing with the door open".
Okay.
That's hard to hear.
Yeah.
I just don't understand why he's being so weird.
I can't believe he would turn on me like this.
He's not being himself.
Maybe because he's facing a terrible decision and he doesn't know what to do.
Yeah, that sounds right.
I think he needs his farm lover.
It's pronounced "for-lohver".
I don't have time to teach you Danish.
I gotta go help Charles!
I'll find out where he is and text you.
That would be helpful!
- Charles, get in the car.
- No!
Go to heck!
Don't siren me.
You quit on me as best man, I'm not talking to you.
Police.
Stop walking.
Ah, I hate that I'm so by the book.
Listen, Boyle, you're not handing in those retirement papers without telling Vivian how you feel.
I won't let you.
Oh, really?
And how are you gonna stop me?
Baton to the knee.
Baton to the knee?
Ahh!
Oh!
Hey, Deetmore.
I'm sorry for making fun of you in front of everybody And also for making fun of you behind your back.
Didn't know you did that, but thank you for the apology.
I'm not done.
Also, I'm sorry for making fun of you during my book club.
Those people don't even know you.
That was uncool.
Also, I'm sorry it's okay.
I get it.
No.
Also, I'm sorry that I didn't take the time to show you how to fix your mistake.
Come on, we can go over it upstairs.
Thanks.
That'd be great.
Oh, one more sorry.
You're about to see a drawing I did of you in the elevator.
Just remember I was really pissed at you at the time.
I'm unquitting as your best man.
Oh, how kind of you.
Are you also taking me to the knee hospital?
Your knee is fine.
Besides, you had it coming for throwing me under the bus like that.
I'm sorry.
I was terrible to you.
It's just I don't know what to do.
I know, it's tough.
But I'm here to support you and not just in your weird, awful wedding decisions.
"Awful"?
Uh-oh.
Did I just plan the worst wedding in history?
Second worst.
Red Wedding, Game Of Thrones.
And, no, your wedding is gonna be incredible because it's exactly what you want.
What you don't want is to go to Canada.
So I don't care how many buses you throw me under, I'm making you talk to Vivian.
Okay, thanks.
You're right.
And you know what?
I'm ready.
No, I'm not!
I'm running away!
Boyle, no!
I'm not ready!
I'm not ready!
I'm not ready!
Hey, superstar.
Why the long fart?
Oh, I meant "face".
Why the long face?
Keep walking, Linetti.
Okay, but this shake is really good.
Listen.
Shh, shh.
Listen.
That's it!
I give up.
Why do you care so much about this diet?
Just stop.
You're in perfect shape.
Mm!
Amen!
I'm not doing it for me.
My wife is on a diet.
She's a little self-conscious about her body since giving birth to twins.
It's crazy!
I think she looks perfect, and I tell her that all the time.
Mm, and I love that you do that, Terry.
She's running around after those girls all day, and I'm not there to help out.
This was one thing I thought I could do with her.
But I'm too weak.
Just hand me that milkshake.
Okay.
Hey, what are you doing?
What Thank you.
We are still a team, and we will keep you from eating so you can support your wife.
Thank you, team.
However, just to be clear, Gina and I are still gonna eat.
I'm eating right now, Terry corndog.
Come on.
There we go.
You got this, all right?
Ah, hello, Vivian.
Charles has something he'd like to say.
In case he tries to flee.
Vivian We need to talk about Ottawa.
___ Jake.
Oh.
Hey.
How'd it go?
Everything okay?
Vivian and I talked for hours.
There's a lot more to discuss, but it's a start.
And you were right.
She didn't dump me.
You did good.
I know you were scared.
Hey Your duties as best man aren't over yet.
What?
Whiskey and cigars!
Mm-hmm.
Thanks for being the best best man.
To the fancy brudgom!
Ah!
Ah, spicy!
Why is that spicy?
Not a doctor.
Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Whoa.
What's with the cast?
I sprained my wrist.
Oh, no!
What happened?
Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.
Yeah!
Geez, Amy.
Back off.
Leave the guy alone.
All right, huddle up, everybody.
Bring it in, bring it in!
So he wouldn't say what happened, which can only mean one thing.
- He's in a fight club.
- No.
He did it doing something he's embarrassed by, like smiling.
Only question is, how do you hurt your arm smiling?
Could be a sports injury.
I sprained my wrist in college playing field hockey.
Men's field hockey?
Yeah.
It's much more violent than the women's game.
We're not allowed to wear anything that protects our breasts.
Attention, everyone, I can hear you speculating about the nature and origin of my injury from my office.
I tripped over an uneven sidewalk.
I did not think it was relevant to your jobs, the jobs which you should all be doing right now.
Get to work.
Do you wanna know how I actually hurt my wrist?
Yes.
I was hula-hooping.
Kevin and I attend a class for fitness and for fun.
Oh, my God.
I've mastered all the moves.
The pizza toss The tornado The scorpion, the oopsie doodle.
Why are you telling me this?
Because no one Will ever believe you.
No.
No!
You sick son of a bitch.
Hey, hey!
What has three thumbs and just made another arrest?
This guy!
It doesn't work if you don't put your thumb up.
Thank you!
New precinct record!
Yeah!
Thank you, thanks.
Dance with me, Jakey.
Ha!
No, and I will never dance to that song.
Wait to go, Jakey!
Whoa!
Are those thumbtacks?
What the hell, Scully?
I thought they'd make good confetti.
Why?
This took a lot of hard work and a lot of late nights.
Take the weekend off, Peralta.
Thank you.
You know, I actually might.
I'm severely sleep-deprived and I'm way behind on laundry.
Good work.
Oh.
That's nice.
Hey!
What's with the bag?
Are you going on a cruise with your mom in 1913?
This is a very stylish bag.
Teddy and I are going to the Berkshires for the weekend.
Oh, for like a police conference?
Nope, just a romantic getaway.
Wow!
That's great.
I know.
We're kind of taking things to the next level.
What are you doing this weekend?
Oh, opposite of the Berkshires.
Work-shires.
Working, whole weekend.
Fighting crime.
I thought you were taking the weekend off to do your laundry.
Does crime take the weekend off to do its laundry, Scully?
No, it doesn't.
Sorry.
Can I call you back?
Bye.
What's up?
Looking for paper towels.
What are you doing in here?
Talking to Vivian.
We're still trying to figure out whether we should move to Canada.
It's awful!
Thank God it hasn't affected how much we bathe together.
Almost never?
All the time.
Thing is it's so hard to talk at work because there's no privacy.
The roof is freezing, the holding cell is full of perps, and their romantic advice is not great.
It's always to tell Vivian, "bitch, get your life right"!
I tried it.
She did not like it.
Let me work on it.
Ah.
Hands up, cop.
Hey no, no.
Oh, no, no!
It's Teddy, your boyfriend!
Aww, boyfriend.
Yeah.
Can you release my arm?
Oh, yeah!
Sorry.
Good one.
Thanks.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to see you before we left for the weekend.
Aw, that's so gross.
What's this weekend?
We rented a cabin in the Berkshires.
We're taking a couples cooking class, and there's this great antiques fair.
Sounds like you two have a wonderful lesbian vacation planned.
Now my question is, will you be back tomorrow afternoon?
Because that is when you promised Holt you'd help with his community outreach meeting.
That's this weekend?
I totally forgot.
How did I let the Captain talk me into that?
Excuse me, everyone.
Would one of you be willing to Me!
I'll do it!
I volunteer all my time.
Crap.
What am I gonna do?
Well, it's okay.
We can reschedule.
I mean, we'll lose the deposit, but Mm, or you could just lie to Captain Holt.
That's my policy for everything and it always works.
I'm not gonna lie.
I'll just tell the Captain I made a mistake, and he'll understand.
Mm-kay.
But if you do lie, you can't go wrong with dental emergency.
Or death of a triplet.
Now that one you can use twice.
Smart.
Good news, sergeant.
I figured out what we're gonna work on this weekend.
I'm working on spending time with my family.
We're having a fancy tea party.
I am the King of origami napkins.
Oh, that's nice.
I thought you were taking the weekend off.
No, I decided to spend the weekend taking things to the next level.
Work-wise.
I found a cold case of ours that everyone foolishly said was unsolvable.
Case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ.
Jake, case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ is unsolvable.
Or maybe case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ is waiting for someone to de-unsolve it.
What's case 52ABX-DASH-32QJ?
Case 52ABX we gotta find a way to abbreviate this thing.
Anyway, it's an old case that the sarge and I worked about eight years ago.
This guy Nate Dexter was murdered in a boat explosion.
No witnesses, no leads, minimal evidence.
This case almost killed us.
Yeah, but I'm on a hot streak!
Plus we're better detectives now.
We're smarter, computers are faster, no more blockbuster.
Drones?
I'm feeling it.
That was creepy.
Huh?
But convincing.
Oh, he's standing up.
I've always wanted to solve that case.
Then think about how good it would feel to finally do it.
What's the best moment of your life?
My wedding day.
Tied with the day my babies were born.
Compared to this, those memories will be garbage.
You don't know what you're saying.
'Cause I'm not married and I don't have kids.
Right?
Okay.
Okay, here's what we know.
Nate Dexter was a small-time crook who pissed someone off.
They blew up his boat, with him still on it, and left no evidence except this one charred finger and Nate's melted torso.
Man, I'm having deja vu right now.
Whoever did it left no evidence, except one charred finger and Nate's melted torso.
So in other words nothing's changed.
Except our attitudes.
So!
We start at the last place that Dexter was seen before he went to the marina His apartment.
I'm telling you, sarge, I got a good feeling about this.
Aw, no!
Well, it appears his building was torn down.
I know this seems like bad news, but on the plus side the harder the solve the sweeter the solve.
No, it's just bad news.
You're bad news.
What?
What?
Just saying you're bad news for bad guys, 'cause you're a number-one cop.
Blacker the Berry the sweeter the juice!
What?
What?
Let's solve the case!
Hey!
We need to tell Charles about Babylon.
He needs a private place to talk to Vivian.
What?
No!
Babylon's our secret place.
It's the best thing in my life, and I have a very full life.
Do you know I know Papa John?
The Papa John.
Someone is lying to you.
We can't tell Charles.
He's incapable of keeping a secret.
I shouldn't tell you this, but we're throwing you a surprise party later!
Look, we tell Charles about Babylon, or I shred your nap blanket into a million tiny rags.
No!
I love wolfie.
Fine!
You win!
Tell Charles.
Hold me close, little wolfie.
Hold me.
All right, convict.
What do you know about the murder of Nate Dexter?
Look, I'll tell you the same thing I told you eight years ago.
I don't know anything about Nate Dexter.
And even if I did The best French toast I ever ate was with mayor Lindsay's dog.
He's very old, he's lost his mind.
We're making progress!
Hello, Captain, my old friend.
I've come to talk with you Again.
I've lapsed into song lyrics.
Santiago, can I help you?
I need to speak with you about this weekend.
Ah, yes, I'm so happy you'll be there to oversee the audio-visual presentation.
The last time did not Go well.
The next chart shows the drop in the crime rate over the last month.
I just erased everything.
I'm so sorry, but I think I'm gonna be unable to help out tomorrow.
Why is that?
Dental emergency.
I'm getting my wisdom teeth pulled.
Wow, you must be in a lotta pain.
Yeah, I've been in pain for days.
I had no idea you were living like this.
No one knows.
I am a rock.
I am an island.
I have lapsed into song lyrics again.
Okay.
That's all of 'em.
What?
What about to Frank Williams?
He's in the infirmary.
He was beat up pretty good, a lot of internal bleeding.
Awesome!
I mean, not the internal bleeding thing.
That sounds horrifying.
But I bet you we can get him to talk if we offer to move him from his current address on beatdown boulevard.
That's a great idea.
Looks like we got lucky.
Hey, side note "Beatdown boulevard," good name for my debut hip-hop record.
Strongly disagree.
Okay.
Will you just tell me where we're going?
Guys?
Guys!
Oh, my God, you're gonna beat me up.
Welcome to Babylon!
It's our secret bathroom.
It's so beautiful.
There used to be a transit police squad down here.
This was a Captain's bathroom.
I found it a while back.
She told me about it a year ago when I got stomach flu from that sewer rave.
Fun night though.
We put a lotta effort into making this place nice.
Look.
Weird crystals.
Also, lavender-scented candles, a zebra-skin rug, and the toilet paper is, mm, triple-ply.
Wow.
It turns anyone's bottom into a VIP.
More importantly It has great cell service.
We thought you could use this place to call Vivian when you need to.
But you have to promise not to tell anyone about this.
I pinky promise.
Not good enough.
Blood pact!
Ahh!
All right, Frank, let's recap, shall we?
You slipped and fell onto a shiv.
Then you got up and fell backwards onto another shiv.
And finally one last shiv fell from the ceiling and into your body.
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.
I think you got shivved.
What do you guys want?
We wanna make a deal.
You know anything about the murder of Nate Dexter?
Maybe.
What do I get if I do?
How about a transfer to another cell block?
One with fewer shivs.
Okay.
I can't be sure, but I think Dexter owed money to a guy named Sam Bunsen.
And that's a new lead!
First lead in eight years.
You were right.
Ohhh, beatdown boulevard Is the toughest street in town No, no.
And if you step to a gangsta crew You're bound to get beat down Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha Santiago.
How are your teeth feeling?
Oh.
Dental emergency?
Yes, it just sorta happened.
It still hurts, but I can make it till tomorrow.
Well, if you're in this much pain, I don't think you should wait.
My brother-in-law is one of the top oral surgeons in the quint-state area.
That's two better than the tri-state area.
He's agreed to see you tonight at 6:00 as a personal favor to me and Kevin.
Wow!
Tonight!
Thank you.
But that's not gonna work Because of the anesthesia and driving myself home.
I'll just go tomorrow.
Teddy can take me.
Nonsense.
I'll drive you to and from the dentist's office myself.
That's great, just great.
He's a good dude.
He's a good, good dude.
Hey, sarge.
No sign of Sam Bunsen in the federal database.
You got anything?
Bad news.
I only found his wife and she hasn't heard from him in eight years.
That doesn't sound good.
Yeah.
That's why I started by saying "bad news".
Terry believes in having a clear topic sentence.
I bet Mrs. Bunsen is lying.
She knows where her husband is.
I pushed pretty hard.
She said she's willing to take a lie detector test.
Well, then let's bust out the polygraph.
Lie detector truth or dare!
No.
Boyle, last time we did that, you ended up telling everyone you had a crush on the teapot from Beauty and the Beast.
It's the way they drew her.
All right, pretty boy, where is it?
Where's what?
The secret bathroom.
Secret what?
Bathroom where?
Okay, Captain, I'll be right there!
Don't lie to us.
We've been watching you.
her, and you guys left together.
You returned at 11:31 smelling of lavender.
And you've been drinking chamomile tea all day long and haven't been to the men's room once.
Since when are you two so into being good detectives?
Since it came to secret bathrooms.
Tell us where it is!
Now!
Okay!
Please state your name one more time.
Are we really doing this again?
It's, like, the fifth time.
That's a lie!
It's only the fourth time!
No?
Okay, my bad.
Continue.
I'm Sophia Bunsen, I haven't talked to my husband in eight years.
This is Nate Dexter.
He was friends with my husband.
I didn't know he was dead.
You think my husband killed him, but I guarantee that's impossible.
Okay.
Good.
But not good enough!
Let's do it again.
Jake, what's going on with you?
She passed the test like five times.
Or maybe She's in cahoots.
With him!
Hmm?
Are you two cahooting?
Are you cahooting?
Jake!
It's over, man.
We had a lead, now it's dead.
It happens!
No.
If it's not her, and it's not him Which I'm still not convinced of, by the way, then it's gotta be the machine.
Strap me in, sergeant.
I'm taking this thing for a test drive of truth.
Thanks for taking us, Marty.
Please, Ray, we're family.
Neither of us can understand you at all.
Ah.
The visual examination doesn't show much inflammation, but these x-rays should be more telling.
Let's see what's beneath the surface.
Oh, stop!
Santiago.
I Oh, God.
I forgot I promised to help you, and I made plans to go to the Berkshires with my boyfriend.
Oh.
Wait.
So you lied to me to get out of work?
Yes.
I may be a liar, but I've got great teeth.
And no one can take that from me.
Have you heard of "over-brushing"?
Oh, no.
Your aggressive technique has stripped away the protective enamel and much of your gum.
You have seven cavities.
I have to say I feel like you deserve this.
Charles!
What the hell is wrong with you?
You told Hitchcock and Scully?
No!
What?
Yep, this is happening.
They were scary.
It was like that moment in Planet of Apes when the monkey talked.
Look, I'm sorry.
You let me into your special place.
Ew.
I messed up, and I'll fix it.
It's okay, Charles, you don't have to.
No!
It's not okay.
Babylon hath fallen.
Charles betrayed us and I will make him pay for it.
Gina, enough.
Boyle needed a bathroom, so we told him about it.
Just like I told you when you needed it?
Leave him alone.
He saved my life.
Plus he's pitiful.
And his life is crap right now.
Yeah!
It is!
Thank you, Rosa.
I'm telling you this machine is broken.
Ask me a question.
Is Jay Z really your favorite artist?
Yes, obviously.
Lie.
See?
It's busted.
Is it?
Or is your favorite artist really Taylor Swift?
No.
Lie.
All right, fine.
She is.
She makes me feel things.
She makes me all of us feel things!
Look, that machine is working just fine.
Why are you being so crazy about this case?
I wanted to work the toughest case we had.
Why?
Because it would feel awesome to solve it.
Because a real man doesn't run from a challenge.
I mean, do they run from the bulls in Pamplona?
Yeah.
That's the whole point of it.
Seriously?
That seems lame.
I don't know why you wanna spend the entire weekend at work, but I'm going home to my family.
See you tomorrow, Jake.
Fine, abandon me!
I don't want you here anyway.
That's a lie.
Come on, man.
I got here an hour early.
This better be good.
Hmm?
Holy Moses!
What happened to you?
I have not slept in, since I last saw you, many hours.
Plus, I think I'm hallucinating because I'm pretty sure I just heard your biceps mocking me.
No, that's possible.
My biceps mock a lotta people.
Mm.
Good to know.
So I rewatched the interrogation, and get this.
Sophia wasn't lying about anything.
She doesn't know who killed Nate Dexter.
But she does know something way better.
Come with me.
Jake!
Hmm?
People normally move after they say that.
Oh, yeah, I feel asleep for a second.
Sorry.
Come with me.
Okay!
Ahh!
Y'all ready for this?
You know what I'm saying?
Terry Jeffords, allow me to introduce to you Our murder victim, the not-dead Nate Dexter.
What the hell is going on?
Right?
Sophia wasn't lying.
I was just not asking the right questions.
She hadn't seen her husband in eight years, but she was positive there's no way that he killed Dexter.
That's when it occurred to me, no one killed him.
Hey, Nate, just talking about how you're alive.
Yeah, I'm alive.
But whose melted torso did we find?
Sophia's husband.
Yes!
Sophia and Dexter were having an affair, husband found out, Nate killed him.
Now I'm telling my friend about how you killed that guy.
It was for love!
Cool motive, still a murder.
Also, you remember that severed finger?
Check this out.
Hey, Nate.
Show us your hands, please?
Ho-ho!
Right?
Cut it off himself.
How screwed up is that?
Anyway, I asked all of my CIs if they had dealings with a nine-fingered man.
Unsolvable case Solved!
Whoo!
What'd you wanna talk to us about?
Well, I got Hitchcock and Scully to promise never to use our bathroom again.
How'd you do that?
The Donald and I call it "the art of the deal".
You want your bathroom back, fine.
I want your chair.
Mine smells like my butt.
Ew!
Fine.
And we want your coyote blanket.
It's not a coyote, it's a wolf.
Learn your animals, idiot.
Told you she wasn't serious.
Let's go, Scully.
Fine!
I can't believe you gave up wolfie.
It was worth it.
Plus, I'm done with wolves now.
I'm into angry unicorns.
If I was a unicorn, I'd never be angry.
Jake!
Nice job on the case.
Great solve!
Thanks.
Aren't you supposed to be in the Berkshires?
I had a dental thing.
But you're such a good brusher.
I know!
Turns out that was my undoing.
Classic.
Yeah.
Hey, you remember Teddy.
Oh!
Yeah.
Hey, man.
How are you?
Great solve.
Can I buy you a Pilsner?
They have awesome Pilsners here.
Teddy's really into Pilsners.
Cool!
Attention!
Everyone raise your glasses to the amazing Jake Peralta!
Today, he did the impossible.
He closed case 52abx-dash-32qj.
Speech, speech, speech!
Look, the real hero here is the murderer.
Because without him there wouldn't be a case.
So here's to Nate Dexter, the murderer.
Captain I wanna apologize for lying.
Thank you.
Next time just talk to me.
Okay.
Now I know this comes on the heels of betraying you, but can I have next weekend off to go to that cabin in the Berkshires with Teddy?
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
I still can't feel my mouth.
Did a little bit dribble out?
What's going on with you?
For the past two days, you've been telling me how amazing it was gonna be to solve this case.
This does not look amazing.
I don't know, man.
I thought I'd be more psyched too.
Maybe I just need a cooler case.
No.
That is not gonna work.
You set the precinct record, you weren't happy.
You solved an unsolvable case, you weren't happy.
No case is gonna make you happy.
Something's bothering you.
And whatever it is you gotta deal with it.
Yeah, well, maybe I can't deal with it right now, or You know, whatever.
I know!
Oh.
That's a tough one.
Yeah.
But solving more cases isn't gonna make you feel any better.
Having a drink with a friend might though.
Thank you, but I don't think another drink is gonna help.
I think having a lot more drinks might help.
There he is!
So Amy, huh?
We're gonna need some shots.
What a man, what a man What a man, what a mighty good man Everybody comes around!
What a man, what a man What a man, what a mighty good man I hate myself right now.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
I didn't wash my hands, and I don't care.
Yup.
Cool to be some place right when things get good, right?
Another pitcher of your strongest beer, please, good sir, and a glass thingie to drink it out of.
And one of whatever this guy's having for that guy, and one of what that guy's having for this guy.
And another round for everyone, on me!
That's right.
That's right.
- Thanks, buddy.
- What's the occasion?
Oh, I'm celebrating.
My name's Jake Peralta, and I just got fired from the NYPD.
All right, listen up.
What you're about to see is highly disturbing, but please, no comments.
This man is in pain, so above all else, be kind.
Good morning, Boyle.
Let's just get it out there.
Vivian broke up with me last night.
I'm sorry, chucklebunny.
Charles, wait!
Yes?
Your food dehydrator.
Oh, God.
It's official.
The wedding's off, and this is what I'm like now.
- Life is a pit.
- Excuse me?
I don't understand.
Did you already have a matrix getup at home for some reason?
No, Gina, I bought this with the money I was going to spend on our honeymoon to cape canaveral.
I'm so sorry, buddy.
Don't be, I'm settling into the darkness nicely.
I definitely get you now.
What you got there, Boyle?
Eggs in a bag.
Nothing brings me joy anymore, not even food.
Now, I only eat for sustenance.
Smart.
Save that for later.
Peralta?
My office, now.
Sir?
Ah.
Commissioner Podolski.
It's been a while.
Maybe because you haven't put any of my children in handcuffs recently.
Yay, enemies for life.
Peralta, have you been investigating Lucas Wint?
Uh, yeah, I have.
I think he's laundering money for drug dealers.
Don't be an idiot.
Lucas Wint is a civic leader.
He runs a major charity, his community center is the lifeblood of that neighborhood, and he officially claims you have been harassing him.
What?
That's insane.
I've been trying to talk to him, and he keeps avoiding me like a guilty person, so I approached him at his weekly basketball game.
Hey there, Wint, I got a couple questions for you.
I told you to back off.
This is completely inappropriate.
No, this is me scoring in your face!
Kobe!
Seemed like an obvious goal-tend, but that's besides the point.
Peralta, do you have any evidence to support your suspicions?
There's a lot of chatter amongst low-level drug dealers.
Chatter?
Sorry, I know.
I hate that word too.
Tittle-tattle.
Just stay away from Wint.
That's an order.
Captain, I'm telling you this is reliable tittle-tattle.
You have to trust me.
Trust me.
It's in your best interest to back off.
Fine.
But just for the record, I think you're both wrong.
Self dismissed.
We have to help Charles.
He's devastated.
I hate seeing him like this.
Breakups are cartoony, thumbs down.
They make people feel face-with-xs-for-the-eyes.
What does that even mean?
The english language cannot fully capture the depth and complexity of my thoughts, so I'm incorporating emoji into my speech to better express myself.
Winky face.
Oh, lord.
Listen, this is simple.
Boyle needs a little rebound nooky.
Eggplant emoji.
Rosa, you wanna get on that?
Don't make me rip your tongue off.
I would talk to him, but I don't think I have any advice.
All of my breakups have been completely mutual.
This is the best possible option for both of us.
Agreed.
Take care.
That was the end of an eight-year relationship.
You know, I haven't had that many romantic breakups, but neither of my children will speak to me anymore.
All right.
None of you are any help.
Sarge and I will cheer up Charles.
Oh.
He's not even chewing them anymore.
Ugh.
Listen to this text Boyle just sent me.
"I finally know what used napkins at a barbecue restaurant feel like".
I hate breakups.
I hope I never go through one again.
Really?
You think you'll spend the rest of your life with Teddy?
What?
No.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Just saying getting dumped is a nightmare.
No arguments here.
I remember my worst breakup.
Eighth grade.
Jenny Gildenhorn.
Hey, Jenny.
Jake, I don't wanna go out anymore.
I like Eddie Fung now.
But it's my bar Mitzvah.
We were gonna grind.
That day, I truly became a man.
Wonder where Eddie Fung is now.
I know exactly where that bastard is.
Get down, it's Wint!
Wha Wint?
Holt told you to drop that.
I thought we were working a burglary.
I know, I lied.
Apology?
Apology accepted.
Look, Podolski is wrong.
Wint is guilty.
Yesterday, I saw him get into a car with a known drug dealer.
I didn't have time to take a picture, but today, I came prepared.
Did you tell Holt what you saw?
No, I don't trust him on this.
How can you not trust Holt?
He's the executor of my will.
Wint has crazy ties to city hall.
I just don't think Holt would risk giving up his command.
Anyway.
Oh, crap.
Where'd he go?
Hello, Detective Peralta.
Amy.
Tell me who's there.
I'm blind.
You disobeyed my direct orders to drop this case.
I staked out Wint 'cause I got a tip he was meeting up with a drug dealer.
And why didn't you tell me about this?
Because you told me to drop the case.
Look, let's just agree to say "I'm sorry" on the count of three.
One, two, three.
See?
Now, I'm just disappointed in both of us.
This is unacceptable, and you've crossed the line.
Sir, I am Amy Santiago, and I have something to say.
I think you're wrong.
I think Detective Peralta is onto something, and you should let him pursue it.
I'm Amy Santiago, and I'm done talking.
Good, because this is none of your concern.
Commissioner Podolski is bringing you up on charges and specs.
You're facing a six-month suspension, and you're on administrative leave until the hearing.
Now, get out of my office.
Fine.
Here's my gun and my badge.
I don't need those.
You're not suspended yet.
You're on administrative leave.
You never let me do anything cool.
Ah.
Good morning, Captain.
I got you your favorite breakfast, a plain bagel and a water.
Don't try to soften me up.
Why'd you ask me to meet you in this alley in Bensonhurst at 9:00 in the morning?
Look, my best chance of not getting suspended is proving that Wint is guilty.
I got a confidential informant I need you to meet.
You continue to work this case against my direct orders?
You astound me.
Thank you, sir.
You astound me as well.
But I didn't find him.
Santiago did.
What is going on with you?
I don't know, sir.
We're both off-roading it here.
My internal GPS has been recalculating for a week.
This is Isaac.
He used to be a pusher for the bay Ridge boys.
Dude, drugs don't need pushing.
They push themselves.
People love drugs.
Tell him about the donations.
All right, look, every friday, I put cash into a duffel bag and bring it to Wint community center, room 265, and they mark it down as a charitable donation in their account book.
Ergo, laundering.
So why should we believe you?
I don't care who you believe.
Just know I hate those dudes now.
They carved up my territory so bad, I had to quit selling drugs, and I love selling drugs.
It was my dream job.
Sir, I filled out a warrant request to search the community center for the account book.
I need you to sign it before I can take it to a judge.
I know I'm asking you to stick your neck out, but please trust me.
Fine.
But I'll be with you every step of the way.
You know, you should just put a microchip in his neck like a little doggy.
All right, Isaac, thank you.
Yeah, you're done.
All right, guys.
We have Peralta's hearing at 4:00.
Anybody seen Boyle?
Present.
He seems even worse than before.
I lost Vivian, and now I might lose Jake.
I don't know what else to do.
I've tried being supportive.
I listened to him talk about Vivian's lips for over two hours.
He kept describing them as "ample".
So ample.
Rosa.
Have you ever been dumped?
No.
In all my breakups, I'm always the dumper.
I know you're having a hard time, but I think I can fix this.
There's this thing that I do whenever I Feel.
What?
Burn everything.
Okay.
This feels right.
No, it's terrible!
Vivian, I won't let you burn!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ow!
Ah!
Ooh!
Ah!
Oh, that's so hot!
What is that?
It's coffee.
Hot coffee?
Look at us, three rogue cops taking on a case the commissioner told us to drop.
Button up your jacket.
Sit up straight.
Judge Mindel has a reputation for being strict and proper.
All right, no worries.
I'll just act like you.
Say something so I can get the cadence of your voice down.
I will not.
Perfect.
I will not.
I Will not.
I will Not.
Have a seat, Detective.
I will not.
Excuse me?
Uh, sorry.
I meant out of respect, I will choose to stand.
Sit, I will not.
This looks like it was filled out by a toddler.
Now, we're going to have to go through this point by point.
Justice cannot be rushed.
But could it be gently nudged into hyper speed?
I take it you're the toddler.
Excuse me a moment.
Mm-hmm.
This is going terribly.
New plan.
I'm gonna charm her.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
I had to take that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
Captain Raymond Holt.
What's up?
You wanted to see me, sarge?
Yeah, come on in, Boyle.
Sorry to hear about your hand.
Thanks.
It makes it really hard to manipulate my egg sack.
Look.
Here's the deal.
I did my Junior year abroad in Tokyo.
And my girlfriend Chiaki?
She broke my heart.
I stared at the paper walls for weeks until my roommates showed me how to vent my feelings.
Take a plate and smash it.
Oh!
Feels good.
Yeah!
All right.
Your turn, Boyle.
Okay.
Vent those feelings!
Okay.
Here we go, sarge.
Yeah.
Oh, my testicles!
We got a warrant.
But now, we need a plan.
We can't just go in there in our uniforms.
They'll destroy the evidence before we even walk through the door.
Good point, Captain Holt, or should I say "Captain Raymond sex vibes"?
Who knew you had such game?
Yes, I've found that many women want what they can't have.
I get it.
Ew.
What the hell is going on?
According to the community center calendar, amateur ballroom dancing competition.
Ah, okay.
I know how we're gonna blend in.
- Don't say "thrift store".
- Thrift store!
I - I want to - Thank you For lettin' me be myself Again Thank you for let Jake, the overwhelming time pressure.
Yep.
All right, Isaac said the account book was in room 265.
It's gotta be upstairs.
Let's head up.
Hey.
Where you goin'?
To the dance contest.
I am nationally-recognized fox-trotter Dave Blathis, and these are my proteges, Rhonda Shawarma and Hank Frankel.
I don't care who you are.
Upstairs is closed to the public.
Fine.
But we didn't have to endure this crap when we danced in Barcelona.
The hearing's starting any second.
There may be another staircase off the dance floor.
I'll sign us up for the contest.
Good idea.
Oh, and Amy.
Hm?
Your dress makes you look like a mermaid.
Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.
I know we're all concerned about Boyle, but again, there is a solution.
Forget your ex with meaningless sex.
It rhymes because it's true.
All right, everyone.
Peralta needs us to stall.
So just keep your answers long.
Add stuff.
Embellish your asses off.
Boyle, you're first.
I don't know if I'm up for this.
I'm so emotional.
I can barely think straight.
Great.
Use that.
Embrace the void.
Would you say Detective Peralta was overly interested in the Wint case?
I only heard Detective Peralta talk about Lucas Wint once.
We were in my car.
I took Vivian on our first real date in that car.
Vivian is my fiancee.
My ex-fiancee.
My never-wife.
Detective Boyle, if you could, please limit your comments to the matter at hand.
I will.
I'd just like the record to reflect that "matter at hand" was one of Vivian's favorite expressions.
We should try to blend in.
Stretch your leg up over your head.
What?
You stretch your leg up over your head.
You think I wouldn't if I could?
Ugh.
Ooh, looks like the Captain found a partner.
Good lord.
Okay, we begin with a free-dance period to the spicy sounds of rumba.
All right.
The linoleum awaits, my dear.
Oh, boy.
I know we're undercover, but I'm starting to get real nervous about this contest.
You need to see a therapist.
Yeah.
Let's dance this way.
- Okay.
- Ho, hoo.
How did you manage to step on both of my feet at the same time?
I'm horrible at this.
When can we stop?
I'm horrible at this I know, I know.
Title of my sex tape.
Huh, well done.
Title of my sex tape.
Oh, my God, the Captain.
He could really win this thing.
How did you get so amazing at dancing?
Jake, focus.
I found a back stairway over here.
And spin.
Who is he?
As far as I can recall, Detective Peralta told me that That He No, I never heard Jake talk about Wint.
And the very fact that you have him on trial is cat-doing- home-alone -face.
Of Look, I've known Jake forever.
Our friendship is little-boy- holding-little-girl's-hand.
God, that guard by the door will not move.
Uh-oh, he just made eye contact with me.
Play it cool.
Dance.
Dance, dance, dance.
You don't have to say "dance" every time you make a step.
Good call.
Hey.
Do you want me to actually show you how to do this so you don't hurt yourself and possibly others?
Yes.
Okay.
Ready?
Mm-hmm.
This is kinda fun.
Yeah.
Maybe Teddy and I should take a class.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Guys, we're running out of time.
What's the plan?
That guard won't move.
We need a distraction.
I'm on it.
Dance, dance, dance, dance.
Oh, God!
Oh!
My ankle!
Sir, my ankle!
Oh, I heard a pop!
I heard a pop!
Is that bad?
Do you know if that's bad?
Oh, God!
Oh, I live to dance!
Ah.
Voila.
So glad no one heard me say that.
Gotcha.
Aw, this is incredible.
The account books have everything.
Dates, names, dollar amounts.
I can't wait to show this to Podolski.
I should probably slip in a Miley-Cyrus-told-you-so face real quick.
It's hard to do on the move.
Peralta, wait.
Santiago, give us a minute.
Sir?
I need you to do something.
And it's gonna sound crazy, but it's important, and I need you to trust me.
So Detective Peralta Do you have any evidence you'd like to present on your behalf?
No.
I have nothing.
Jake.
What happened?
Did Holt ask you to get suspended?
No, he told me to get fired.
Why?
I don't know.
I'm kind of freaking out.
He said to do it, and the next thing I knew, I was just yelling.
And your mother!
All of your mothers.
And your grandmothers.
And your grandmothers' little dogs.
Are you done?
No, I'm not done!
Aw, you're done!
You can't handle the me!
- Oh, my God.
- Peralta!
Hey.
What's goin' on?
This is special agent Clarke with the FBI.
FBI?
We couldn't let you expose Lucas Wint.
It would've compromised a much larger ongoing federal investigation.
We believe that Wint has ties to the Ianucci crime family.
That's one of the best crime families.
We needed you to get fired for real because the Ianuccis have moles inside the NYPD, and we need them to trust you.
Detective, we'd like you to go undercover and help us with the investigation.
Okay, the answer is "yes".
My name is Duncan buck.
I was raised on a oil rig by 90 men and 1 prostitute.
We'd like you to be yourself.
Even better.
This could be very dangerous.
- So please, take some time, and - No need.
I'm in.
Eyes closed, head first, can't lose.
I don't think that's the expression.
Can you just let me have this?
What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.
Detective Peralta will be going in an undercover assignment with the FBI.
His cover story is that he was fired.
Oh, my God.
My heart just threw up.
Look, they're saying this assignment will last about six months, so while I'm gone, Boyle, I want you to have my desk.
I'll sit at it always.
Rosa, you can have my locker.
Sweet.
Amy, you can have all of my open cases.
Okay, that's enough.
Peralta doesn't have the authority to do any of this.
You will all sit at your own desk and work the cases I assign you.
But you will be missed.
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you for trusting me.
Okay, now call us all names and storm out of here for the benefit of the bullpen.
This is the best day ever.
I'll miss you guys.
And your mother!
And your mother.
You're all a bunch of pigs!
I smell bacon!
And guess what else, "Captain"?
You can take this tie and shove it straight into your hellhole!
This whole place reeks of bacon.
And guess what?
I'm going kosher 'cause Jake-y don't dig on swine!
Whoo!
All right, everyone.
I wanna make a toast.
To you guys.
You will never be Jake or Vivian, but at least you're here.
Ugh, I'm gonna go over by the bar where I can hear you worse.
Oh, I get it.
I'd abandon me too.
That's it.
Boyle, no more eggs.
You are drinking your troubles away.
Start with this.
I'm gonna get some bottles from the bar.
Make way!
Large man helping his little friend.
Comin' through!
You're so lucky you've never been through a painful breakup.
The only reason they haven't been painful is 'cause the guys were all losers.
I've never dated anyone good.
Hmm.
Like you.
Amy?
Hey, thought I missed you.
Hey, Jake.
Amazing assignment.
I have to admit I'm a little jealous.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Well, if you want, I could help you get fired.
I'm really good at it.
Yeah.
This is real.
This is happening.
Look I don't wanna be a jerk.
I know you're dating Teddy, and it's going really well.
It's just What's going on?
I don't know what's gonna happen on this assignment.
And if something bad goes down, I think I'd be pissed at myself if I didn't say this.
I kinda wish something could happen between us, romantic-styles.
And I know it can't 'cause you're with Teddy, and I'm going undercover, and that's just how it is.
But Anyway, we're not supposed to have any contact, so I should go.
America needs me.
Bye.
And another round for everyone on me!
Thanks, buddy.
What's the occasion?
Oh, I'm celebrating.
My name's Jake Peralta, and I just got fired from the NYPD.
I'm Leo Ianucci.
Nice to meet you.
