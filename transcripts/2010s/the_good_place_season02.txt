{START OF EPISODE 1}
1 In the afterlife, there's a good place and there's a bad place.
You're in the Good Place.
-  - Eleanor, you are my soul mate.
Chidi, you'll stand by my side - no matter what, right?
- Of course I will.
I'm not supposed to be here.
- Wait, what?
- Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet Tahani and Jianyu.
- Boop!
- Oh!
- You booped me.
- I did.
His real name is Jason.
He's a drug-dealing DJ - from Florida.
- What's up, homey?
The problem in the neighborhood is me.
-  - You have all done bad things since you arrived here.
The Bad Place is owed two people.
You can decide.
Holy motherforking shirtballs.
- This is the Bad Place.
-  Except for you four, everyone in this neighborhood - is one of us.
- You saw us all on Earth a selfish ass, an idiot DJ, a tortured academic, a hot, rich fraud.
You thought we would torture each other.
The only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.
That's it!
My big mistake was having you be soul mates living next to each other.
Next time, I'll spread you out so it's more of a slow burn.
I'm gonna erase your memories, make a few changes, and start over again.
Just gotta get the boss-man to sign off.
If this thing goes sideways again, you are done.
Do your worst.
We figured it out once, we can do it again.
Janet?
Open up.
Because you know what, Michael?
You basic You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
- Cool.
- I'm your soul mate.
You'll stand by me no matter what, right?
Hold that thought.
Is it okay if I go work out?
I gotta stay jacked.
It's who I am.
- See you soon.
- Hi there.
-  - I'm Janet.
I think this is yours.
After I was rebooted, I found it in my mouth.
What the fork is a "Chidi"?
Why can't I say fork?
Okay, here we go.
Confidence, Mikey.
Project confidence.
There he is!
How's it going, boss-man?
Enough chit-chat.
Is everything in place - for version two?
- Yup!
We're keeping everything from version one that made them miserable, adding a bunch of new stuff that they'll hate.
For example, all the coffee is from those little pods.
Diabolical.
Plus, they will all have new soul mates, of course.
You gotta trust me on this, boss.
I've thought of everything.
- I won't let you down.
- I think you will.
I think this entire project of yours is stupid and doomed to fail.
I think you're going to be retired, eliminated from existence and burned on the surface of a billion suns.
And I have no doubt that you and your cockamamy experiment will go down in history as colossal failures.
- You know, I think if - Toodle-oo.
Okay, take two, folks.
Any last questions before we start up again?
- Yes.
- Just so I'm clear: we're not pairing them up this time?
Correct.
Obviously, the eventual goal is to get them to torture each other, but first we're going to create some nice, individual torment.
In version one making them soul mates, we probably bit off more than we could chew.
We could bite them?
I didn't know we were allowed to bite them.
That's an expression, Chuck.
All right, go ahead, Vicky.
Yeah, I have some questions about my new character.
I feel like I got Real Eleanor like, I got her, you know?
But this new character, "Denise" I mean, who is she?
I don't get her.
Is she a quirky best friend type, or more of a femme fatale, "sexuality is her weapon of choice" type?
- Both both those things.
- I have some questions about my character too.
Like - can he bite them?
- No.
Okay, reminder: the most important thing tonight and this is crucial you need to get Eleanor drunk at the welcome party, so she will say and do a bunch of bad stuff.
And then we take that stuff and use it to build our chaos sequence in the morning.
For example, you remember last time, she stole all the cocktail shrimp, and we made giant nightmare shrimp fly through the sky?
See, it's those details that make her realize she's in danger of being found out.
I know that this kind of large-scale deception is not what you were trained to do.
There are gonna be days when you're just sick of being around these disgusting humans, with their weird, gross little mouths, and their stupid elbows.
You're gonna be tempted to say, "Screw it.
Can't we just go back to HQ "and do this the old-fashioned way?
"Pull out some fingernails, toss someone in an acid pit, fire up the old penis flattener"?
And sure, sure, that sounds nice.
But it also sounds easy.
We're all here because we believe that there's a better way to make humans miserable.
And I I believe in you.
So, "torture" on three.
Ready?
One, two, three all: Torture!
- And biting!
- Nope!
No.
Hey, lady?
Can you come back?
Joey?
Janine?
J Jaja?
Why don't I ever listen to people when they talk about themselves?
No, it's annoying, and I'm right not to.
Okay, Chidi, where are you?
Or what are you?
A type of soup, maybe?
Hi there.
I'm Eleanor.
Nice to meet you, Eleanor.
I'm Nina.
This is my soul mate, Bart.
Love it.
Love people's names and love learning all about them.
- Where are you all from?
- Well, oddly enough, - I was born in Mozambique - Cool.
Listen, do you guys know if there's, like, a neighborhood phone book with everybody's name listed in it?
Oh, I don't think so, 'cause, I mean, there's no phones here.
There are no phones here?
Of course.
Duh!
There's no use for 'em.
I always prefer talking to people anyway.
People are like nature's apps.
Huh.
Anyway, we're on our way to get some pizza.
Would you like to join us?
Maybe we could get to know each other a little bit, - chat.
- Uh, I'm good.
I'm gonna explore a little bit.
But it was so nice to meet you Nina, and B bye-bye.
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.
Chidi?
Are you Chidi?
Eleanor?
What are you up to?
Oh, hey there, Michael.
Just getting to know everyone in the neighborhood.
- Oh!
- Who was that mysterious gentleman wearing the nightgown?
Oh, that's Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk who never speaks.
Might be a little hard to get to know him.
Eleanor you and I both know that you're not like everyone else in this neighborhood.
Everyone here led a remarkable life.
But you the work you did as an environmental activist was just extraordinary!
Ah  Well, it's the environment.
I mean, I loved, um mushrooms.
- I can honestly say that.
- Well, it paid off, because you were the number one point-getter in this entire neighborhood.
And as such, I was just hoping that you could say a few words at tonight's welcome party.
You know, just to introduce yourself.
How can I say no?
Can I say no?
It doesn't feel like I can say no.
But if I can: - Michael, I'm saying no.
- Okay, so, you'll speak for maybe an hour or so?
Hey, you know what?
I got you a little something to wear here.
Now, all the top point-getters wear these - on the first night.
-   Oh, you gotta be forking kidding me.
So, long story short, my heart is in the Pope, my liver's in the Dalai Lama, and my teeth were strung into a necklace for a child king in French Polynesia.
But it got me into the Good Place, - so can't complain.
- Wow.
Can I tell you something, - just soul-mate to soul-mate?
- Hold that thought.
- I'm gonna head to the gym.
-  Oh, you're serious.
Again?
Right now?
Yeah.
I'll catch you later!
Hey there, best person!
You must be Eleanor.
I'm Jessica, the host.
- Hi.
- Michael told us all about your speech.
I can't wait to hear - what you have to say.
- Me neither, Jessica.
Me.
Neither.
Aw, don't be nervous.
Here.
- Liquid courage.
- Actually, um you know what?
I think I need to keep a clear head.
Can you imagine getting drunk before giving a big speech?
Getting kicked out of your niece's christening, and then, only later, once you've sobered up, realize you don't even have a niece.
It's like, who was that kid?
So, Eleanor, you were an environmental lawyer.
- That's fascinating.
- Yeah.
I know.
Just don't ask me any questions about it.
I am so sick of describing exactly what it means.
Hey, I'm headed to the bar.
Can I grab you something?
How about a margarita?
- No, I'm good.
-  Actually, I'm the best according to the sash.
She's still not drinking?
Nope.
Something's off.
Should we -  - No.
Keep it together.
Ah, screw it.
Couple of quick shots  And then I'm coming for you, shrimpies.
Please don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi.
These are for you.
Drink up.
Hi.
Is your name Chidi?
- Yes?
- Ah!
I knew you weren't a soup.
- What?
- Listen to me very carefully.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
We need to talk.
Chidi?
Come on in.
So there really is an afterlife.
I can't wait to have breakfast with Kant, and lunch with Michele Foucault, and then have dinner with Kant again, so we can talk about what came up at breakfast.
I'm sorry, Chidi all the great philosophers in history  ended up in the Bad Place.
All of my heroes are Being tortured.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Actually, it is kind of clever how they punish philosophers.
Every day, they make them go to school naked, and then they take a test in a class they've never been to.
And then they smash them with hammers.
And that part is not so clever.
But the point is: Chidi, you were way better than all of them.
You're safe.
No way.
Soul mates are real?
They sure are.
Although, your soul-mate situation is a little unusual.
Oh, no.
I don't have one, do I?
That's fine.
I mean, who needs a soul mate, anyway?
My soul mate will be - books!
- No, no, it's not that you don't have a soul mate, it's that you have multiple soul mates.
Here.
Now, normally, our omniscient system perfectly analyzes each person's profile, and then matches him or her with another person.
But in your case, the system matched you with two other people.
It's a rare occurrence, like like a double rainbow, or someone on the Internet saying, "You know what?
You've convinced me I was wrong".
So, how do you choose who I should be with?
Oh, I don't choose.
You do, Chidi.
I  What?
This is AngÃ©lique, Pedro, and Pevita.
According to the system, either Pedro or Chidi could be matched perfectly with either AngÃ©lique or Pevita.
So, figure it out.
Should be fun.
Cool beans.
One second, guys.
- Um, so, so, so - Yeah?
Yeah, so making decisions isn't necessarily - my strong suit.
- I know that, buddy.
You you once had a panic attack at a make-your-own-sundae bar.
There were too many toppings.
And very early in the process you had to commit to a chocolate palate or a fruit palate, and if you couldn't decide, you wound up with kiwi-Junior-Mint-raisin, and it just ruins everyone's night.
Chidi, I am so sorry.
I literally cannot choose for you.
This has to be your decision.
Buddy, you gotta trust me.
I would never place you in a painful situation.
A- Right.
Um You ready, Chidi?
Here you go, Chidi.
One slice of Hawaiian, straight out the oven for you.
I'm Denise.
Welcome to my pizza place.
- Thanks, Denise.
- And here's one for you.
Have a nice day.
It's interesting that Hawaiian pizza is so popular here.
Yeah, I guess a lot of the residents here love it.
Kind of makes you wonder what type of pizza they have in the Bad Place, huh?
So, I can't believe you studied in Brisbane.
We must have just missed each other.
- What was your thesis on?
- Oh, gosh.
It was so boring.
It was called, "Cultural Relativism and Moral Absolutism: "An Exploration of Values As Seen Through "The Works of Alain LeRoy both: Locke and Immanuel Kant"!
Shut up.
You read it?
No, but that pairing is the most obvious pairing to employ in a paper with that title, - and I wanna read it so bad!
-  What about Morocco?
You ever travel there?
No.
What about anywhere else?
You been anywhere else?
No.
So, first impressions?
Anyone?
I kind of want to hear what Chidi thinks.
Well.
Um I mean, you're both brilliant, accomplished women and Pedro, you're great too.
Just amazing people.
I'm surrounded.
Ahh!
But, if I had to say who I sort of immediately bonded to, on a gut level, I think I would say that I kind of feel like my soul mate is - AngÃ©l - Wait, wait!
There was a mistake in the calculations.
We had a four-hour time gap in your profiles on May 10, 2003.
I corrected that day's events for all of you, and ran the numbers again, and the final result proves definitively that Pedro is AngÃ©lique's soul mate, and Chidi, your soul mate is Pevita.
That was close.
Hey, you guys hadn't made a decision yet, had you?
No!
We did not.
No one said anything.
I didn't hear anything, and I certainly didn't say anything.
That's for darn sure.
-  -    Okay.
All right.
See you later.
This is fun.
It's a fun party.
There's no question about it, this is a fun situation.
Hey, you guys are here.
The fun continues nay, increases!
You two look nice.
Thanks!
And you look  fine.
Would I say you look better than anyone else here?
No, I wouldn't say that.
Do you look bad?
No.
But good?
Would I go as far as to say that you look good?
Doubtful.
Hey, wine.
Mmm.
Do I feel like red or white?
Oh, deep down in your heart of hearts, you probably already know which one you want.
Why isn't anyone talking?
Janet, could you show me to the bar, please?
Mm-hmm!
Oh, hey!
Chidi, right?
Denise.
We met earlier, remember?
Oh, yeah, hi.
Are you limping?
Yeah, I am.
Crazy story.
See, I was a trapeze artist in an illegal circus - in Bangladesh - AngÃ©lique.
Hey.
How are you doing?
Oh, well, uh  You know.
My stomach's in knots and I'm stress-grinding my teeth, and it feels like my soul is being suffocated.
You know, just your standard paradise stuff.
How about you?
It's been a little uncomfortable.
I think Pedro maybe heard you say - that thing you were gonna say.
- Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
I But I have to ask.
Do you feel the way I feel?
- We can't talk about this.
- Well, I know, but if the numbers were that close, AngÃ©lique, I think I'm supposed to Stop!
Please don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi.
These are for you.
Hi.
Is your name Chidi?
- Yes?
- Ah!
I knew you weren't a soup.
- What?
- Listen to me very carefully.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
- We need to talk.
- About what?
Just shut your mouth, smile at me, and walk over here.
Okay, you're definitely my least favorite person  I've met so far.
Okay, I'm sorry, this is really not a good time.
I'm right in the middle of something.
Dude, I'm guessing we have about 30 seconds to talk before someone notices.
When I got here, some robot lady appeared out of thin air and gave me this.
- You mean Janet.
- Oh, that's it!
Janet.
- Hi there.
- Not now, Janet.
- Buzz off.
- Okay.
-  - Now, I have no memory of writing this, but it is my handwriting.
And that's your name, right?
So, for some reason, at some point, I put this note into that whatever-lady's robot mouth.
- You already forgot her name?
- No, I didn't.
Her name is - Janet.
- Hi there.
-  Fork off!
- Okay.
-  - From the second I got here, these nerds have been acting real weird, trying to get me drunk.
My soul mate ditches me every time I try to talk to him, and this Zen-master guy gave me this magic bracelet thing, and then he just ran away.
Something very strange is going on here, and the only person I trust is me, and me told me to find you.
So what's the deal?
What's happening?
What do you got?
Uh I can't  Look, I'm I'm sorry, but none of this means anything to me, and I've got my own problems to deal with.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Attention, everyone!
Speech time!
I know you're probably not a magic wizard trapped in an amulet, but if you are, please get me out of this speech.
Tahani.
Come on in.
You're in the good place, Tahani.
Ooh, what a surprise!
But yes, I accept.
This is your soul mate, TomÃ¡s.
Now, TomÃ¡s was a doctor with the International Rescue Alliance, and you raised money that ultimately funded his medical missions.
It's just so perfect!
- Aww.
- It's lovely to meet you, - Tahani.
- Charmed, I'm short.
I'm sorry, did I just say "short"?
I-I meant to say "charmed, I'm sure," of course, because I am charmed to meet you, it's just an unfortunate Freudian short.
Shall we?
So, where did you attend medical short?
So, this is the living room as well as the kitchen and the bedroom.
It's so cozy.
I feel like the walls are just hugging me.
-  - Michael, I don't mean to be rude, but this is simply absurd.
Yes, thank you.
I didn't want to say anything, but There's only two of us, and we don't need all this space.
- "All this space"?
- Oh, of course.
You two humanitarians don't want anything so extravagant.
I'll just get rid of the second floor.
Okay, I'll let you two have some alone time.
I will see you at the party.
Well certainly is quite quaint.
So, it's just fun.
I daresay even quite charm ah, no.
- What's the matter?
- Sorry, it's just a self-portrait of my my sister.
Wonderful.
Your sister is Kamilah Al-Jamil?
I used to play her music for my patients.
At times, it felt like Kamilah's songs were curing the malaria for us.
Great.
Well, I best be getting changed for tonight.
- Mm.
- Can hardly wear a day dress - to an evening event.
- Sounds good.
I'm ready whenever you are.
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Oh, yeah.
My years treating remote villagers taught me to favor comfort over style.
But you should wear whatever you prefer.
Well, I mean as we are soul mates, perhaps I-I should also dress down.
You all right, my dear?
Yes, just not used to dressing like a plumber-ess.
Is that what you call a female plumber, or is it a toilet sweep?
Or clog wench?
In any case, that's how I'm dressed.
My darling, you are in the Good Place.
Relax.
Feel the breeze on your feet.
That's why Crocs have holes in them.
I'll get us a drink.
Lower that beautiful face for me, won't you?
- Lower-lower-lower-lower-lower.
- Okay.
Muah!
Tahani?
You all right?
Michael, hello!
Yes, I'm having a splendid time.
Although, if I'm being honest, a few aspects of my day have been sub-optimal.
Really?
Like what?
Well, my house is a bit small, which is fine, it's just not what I'm used to, and TomÃ¡s is lovely, but we haven't really "clicked" yet, to use a mundane colloquialism which I suppose I should do, now that I'm wearing  Cargo pants.
Tahani, it's very common to experience adjustment pains.
But the system matched you and TomÃ¡s, and the system is never wrong.
But guess what?
This is the Good Place.
If you want your house to be larger, then just ask.
Do you want something this big?
Or maybe bigger, like the Taj Mahal.
I know, I know.
How about a moon?
Would you like to live on your own private moon?
No, no, no.
My house is wonderful.
And really, it's so silly to want a bigger house of all things, here in paradise.
So no, no changes needed.
Okay, all right.
But if you change your mind, just ask.
Because all the other residents are very happy, so it'll give me plenty of time to deal with whatever requests you make.
No demand is too what's the word?
Oh, "frivolous".
Okay?
Wow.
That is rough.
Please don't make this harder than it already is, Chidi.
These are for you.
Drink up.
Oh no, no, I  Hey!
Twinsies!
- I'm sorry?
- Look!
Cargo-pants buddies!
I bet we have a lot in common.
I was a garbage man in Winnipeg.
How about you?
Okay  Crocs also?
!
-  - Speech time!
I know you're probably not a magic wizard trapped in an amulet, but if you are, please get me out of this speech.
I've asked our top point-getter, here, to say a few words.
So, take it away, Eleanor!
The dictionary defines "best" - as being -  Oh, God, boring!
I'd like to say a few words if nobody minds.
Thank you, wizard.
I am Tahani.
Tahani am me.
And even though I wasn't the "number one point-getter," I just wanted to welcome you all to the neighborhood.
You all look so beautiful tonight, with your regular-sized pockets and regular-sized soul mates.
Oh, no offense, darling, wherever you are.
Probably somewhere down there.
Why don't you try to ease her off the stage - and take over yourself?
- The point is, we're all good people, right?
We all did the right thing whenever we could.
And that's why it's so nice to be here among you, in this massive house that I want.
I want this house.
Give it.
No, I'm just kidding.
But really, give me the house.
Hey there, hot stuff.
Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Get your hands off me!
Oh, you think you're better than I am, don't you, just 'cause you're wearing that.
Look at that terrible placement and angle.
Is this your first time ever wearing a sash?
Yeah, it is, but I think if we all just Well give it to me then!
I got her off the stage.
Jianyu?
Come on in.
Before we start, I know you were a Buddhist monk who kept a vow of silence.
Would you prefer to remain silent here as well?
Every resident here in the Good Place has a soul mate.
Now, some of the pairings are platonic, some are romantic, but what you have with your soul mate is unique.
You have a spiritual connection that transcends the physical realm.
This person's gonna be your best bud.
Jianyu, let me introduce you to your soul mate, Luang.
He is also a Buddhist monk, from the Lumbini zone of Nepal.
You and Luang share an identical soul like binary stars, orbiting one another in a perfect, reflective harmony.
You won't ever have a single moment of loneliness, because you'll always be right next to each other for eternity.
Okay, I'm gonna let you two get acquainted.
I'm sure you have a lot to not talk about.
Because well, you get it, you get it.
Oh sorry, I didn't see you.
Chidi?
Are you Chidi?
- Eleanor?
What are you up to?
- Oh, hey there, Michael.
Just getting to know everyone in the neighborhood.
- Ah.
- Who was that mysterious  Hello, you beautiful spirits.
Can I offer you two something to drink?
- Janet!
- Hi there.
This is Janet.
Now, she can get you literally anything you want.
All you have to do is ask.
Of course, you two won't ever want anything, because you're perfectly content.
Oh, I know.
How about something special?
Janet, two yak's milks, please.
Enjoy.
-  - Speech time!
- If we all just - Well give it to me!
I got her off the stage.
Tahani?
- Are you all right?
- Yes, fine.
Never better.
Top of my game, actually.
You'll have to excuse me, 'cause I've got to go, so Oh, look!
I've got some shrimp.
In one of my many, many cargo-pants pockets.
What the fork is happening?
Okay, here we go.
- How's it going, boss-man?
- Enough chit-chat.
Is everything in place for version two?
Yup, I've thought of everything.
I won't let you down.
I was just hoping that you could say a few words at tonight's welcome party.
You know, just to introduce yourself.
How can I say no?
So cozy.
I feel like the walls are just hugging me.
How about something special?
Janet.
Two yak's milks, please.
Why isn't anyone talking?
Janet, could you show me to the bar, please?
Mm-hmm.
Michael, may I please speak with you privately?
Sure, sure.
It just feels like I used to be Real Eleanor, - and now I'm Denise.
- Denise is a good part, with a a great backstory.
You run the best pizza place in the neighborhood.
You have a cat, and that's cool.
I took this job because it seemed fun and different, and in the original version, I got to break Chidi's heart, like, 20 times, and it was great.
I mean, he was miserable.
And now, AngÃ©lique gets to torture him?
AngÃ©lique is a hack.
I can act circles around her!
But I have nothing to do!
I am a Ferrari, okay?
And you don't keep a Ferrari in the garage.
I hear your concern.
I do.
And I promise you, there is a great arc coming for Denise the pizza lady - in about 80 years or so.
-  Chidi is going to accidentally kill your cat.
It's gonna give you a great chance to shine.
Can I just have something that makes me stand out?
A mysterious past, or a limp!
- I want a limp.
- This is supposed to be the Good Place.
Why would Okay, I no, I hear you.
I'll tell you what.
Go nuts, all right?
Limp your heart out.
Oh, hey!
Chidi, right?
Hi.
Are you limping?
- How's it going?
-  We're having some trouble with Eleanor.
She's not engaging in conversation, - she's not drinking.
- Eleanor's not drinking?
She brought a flask in the car during her driver's test!
Okay, we need to keep things moving here.
I'm about to make her talk for an hour.
She'll definitely end up insulting somebody.
Speech time!
We're all good people, right?
We all did the right thing whenever we could.
- If we all just - Well give it to me!
Tahani?
Are you all right?
Yes, fine.
Never better.
You'll have to excuse me, 'cause I've got to go.
- What the fork, man?
- I know that book.
Is that some kind of nerd pick-up line?
Because it's only kind of working.
No the note you showed me before.
All right, this is from a book called "What We Owe to Each Other".
I used to teach it.
I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy.
- All right, brag much?
- No, I'm trying to help you.
- Sorry.
Okay.
- I have never seen you before in my life, but I think somehow, that we know each other.
That definitely sounded like a pick-up line.
-  - And I'm not not interested, but we need to figure this out first.
-  - It's not that bad, right?
I mean, we got a drunken speech.
That's good.
No.
It isn't.
Tahani gave the drunken speech instead of Eleanor.
We can't build a chaos sequence out of Tahani's speech, because she thinks she belongs here ding-dong.
Okay, we can still salvage this.
- Where's Eleanor?
- She's gone.
- I can't find her anywhere.
- Maybe she left with Chidi?
- He's gone too.
- What?
Or maybe she left with Jason.
You lost Jason?
How is that even possible?
You're only job is to stand next to that idiot.
I got distracted by the fire!
I love fire.
You know, my main job is to burn people with fire.
- What's up, guys?
- What are you doing here?
- Why aren't you with Eleanor?
- Oh, I told her I was going to the gym again.
Why would you say that in the middle of a party?
- You told me too.
- No, I didn't.
You said that if Eleanor tries to confess that she doesn't belong here, find a reason to avoid her, like saying, "I'm going to the gym," so that's what I've been saying.
That was a suggestion of the type of thing you could say!
Don't How many times have you specifically told her you were going to the gym?
Five.
- No, nine.
- You dimwit!
Hey, man!
I was perfectly happy in my old job in the twisting department.
People came in, and I twist them until they snapped in half, and I move on to the next one.
But this job is weird!
It's all talk, no twisting.
So if you don't like the way I do it, get somebody else.
I'm going to the gym!
Fine.
Yeah, you do that.
You go to the gym.
Okay, we can still pull this off, we just need to find the four humans.
Okay?
Okay.
Right now.
Everyone in this room, find those four humans!
Are you gonna talk, or just walk around like a nerd trying to get a personal best on his Fitbit?
I'm sorry, I'm trying to process a tremendous amount of insane information.
I mean, you're not supposed to be here, but you and I clearly met here, somehow, before now.
I mean does that mean that I'm not supposed to be here?
I don't know, dude.
Were you a good person on earth?
I I think so.
I spent my life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the uni  Oh, no!
I used almond milk in my coffee, even though I knew about the negative environmental impact.
- What?
- Eleanor, what do we do?
I don't know, dude!
But we better figure it out soon, or we're doomed.
- Uh, Janet?
-  - Hi there, Jianyu.
- Hi, Janet!
Um, can I tell you something?
- Sure.
- I'm not Jianyu.
And I'm not a silent monk.
My real name is Jason.
And I don't know what's going on.
I got here and Michael said I'm a monk, and he told me I was gonna have a new best friend, and that we were gonna live in a yogurt.
- A yurt.
- Oh, yeah, "yurt" for short.
I was psyched to meet my new best friend, but he turned out to be this weird silent guy that won't leave me alone.
I don't wanna go back to my yogurt.
- Can I go to your house?
- I don't have a house, Jason.
I live in a boundless void.
- Can I go there?
- No.
It's a boundless void.
- Okay.
- So, what you're saying is, there are certain aspects of your existence here in the Good Place that are confusing for you, and you're searching for someplace to go where you feel less lonely.
I know somewhere you could go.
- Why did you do that?
- Because you were nice to me.
- You're my friend.
- Okay!
Okay!
Okay, so, if we got all the way to Scanlon, we must have been studying very intensely for a very long time.
Or, you grabbed a random book of mine and just tore a page out.
I'm gonna be honest, that sounds more like me.
Ah!
Eleanor and Chidi.
What a pleasant surprise.
I'm so happy you two have met.
I'm just going door-to-door, apologizing for the commotion earlier tonight.
- Ah.
- The first night in the afterlife can be a little overwhelming.
Don't worry about us, Michael.
We are doing just fine.
Oh, good, good.
Glad to hear that.
Well, it's getting late.
Chidi, allow me to escort you back to your house.
- Um - Uh, hello, all.
Sorry for the late hour, Eleanor.
I wanted to stop by and give you back your sash.
That's okay.
You can just keep it.
No!
I don't deserve it.
I made a complete fool of myself tonight.
I interrupted your big speech, badly stained my cargo pants, which, I have to admit, are quite comfortable.
Oh, God, what's happened to me?
I'm praising off-the-rack separates!
Tahani, please.
It's late.
- I think what we should do - No.
Look, ever since I got here it feels like something's been off.
Tahani.
There you are.
I've been worried sick about you.
That's her soul mate?
Is there a second one of him that stands on his shoulders?
Chidi!
There you are.
I've been worried sick about you.
Okay all right, everybody.
Now we are really imposing on Eleanor here.
Chidi, let's everybody take off Hi, Eleanor.
This person would like to speak with you privately.
About something.
Oh, really?
- Yup.
Bye!
-   This is the wise monk who gave me the magic amulet.
I gotta figure out what it means.
Could be the key to this entire mystery.
Luang, perfect.
Why don't you take Jianyu back to your yurt, - right away.
- Homey, no!
I'm not spending another second with this loser.
You said he was gonna be my best friend, but he is not.
My best friend from Jacksonville was named Pillboi, and he was dope!
We would talk together, get high together, throw old batteries at drones together.
But this guy can't hold a camel to Pillboi.
Okay, I no longer think he's a wise monk, and I'm pretty sure this is just a piece of garbage.
Babe, there you are.
I've been worried Let me stop you.
Can I guess?
You've been worried sick about me.
I'm headed to the gym.
Sure, why not?
- I'm quite confused.
- Let me explain, gorgeous.
I don't know what this place is, but it is certainly not the Good Place.
Michael is forking with us.
- Like a prank show.
- Yeah, like a prank show.
Except according to this note, it's a prank show we've all been on before.
- What note?
- Apparently, I wrote myself a note, and stuck it in that Jackie lady's mouth.
Janet.
Her name is Janet.
- Oh, right, Janet.
- Hi there.
- Hi Janet!
- Hi Jason.
Are you kidding me?
Eleanor Shellstrop, you sneaky little so-and-so.
That was some very quick thinking.
I'm extremely impressed.
And to be honest I'm relieved.
At least there's an explanation for why this all went south so fast.
But you're not gonna be so lucky next time.
- Next time?
- What?
- Yeah.
- He's gonna do it again!
That's not gonna work this time - dummy.
- Okay, excuse me.
I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.
I demand to speak to your superior.
I am so sorry, madam.
Please forgive me.
Well, as humans like to say, third time's the charm, right?
I take full responsibility for the false start.
But I assure you all, there is no note this time.
I'll prove it to you.
Janet!
-  - Hi there.
Hi, Janet.
Open your mouth please.
Thank you.
See, no notes.
No clues or loopholes nothing in there!
Thank you, Janet.
So, let's all just pretend the last attempt never even happened.
- Questions.
- Maybe it's none of our business, but did you tell Shawn - what happened?
- Yes, I did.
And he completely understood.
As a matter of fact, he found the whole thing kind of funny.
But he was very supportive, and he says he's very excited for us to get going again.
So, anyone else?
Anybody?
No?
Then let's get out there and make some miseries!
Testing, one, two, three  - Hey there, boss-man.
- You were supposed to call me - this morning, give me an update.
- Oh.
Right, sorry.
Yeah, it's just the the chaos sequence was going so well better than the first time, in my opinion.
Eleanor got completely drunk last night.
She talked for, like, an hour.
You know, even flashed somebody, so we had a lot to work with.
So, attempt number two is on track so far?
Oh, smooth as silk.
Everything's great.
-  - Oh!
Sounds like everything's going well back there too.
We're trying out the new butthole spiders.
- Ah!
- They're enormous.
You know, good old-fashioned torture the way it's supposed to be.
Good luck with attempt number two.
And remember, there will be no attempt number three.
Eleanor.
Come on in.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1 This is daily notes log for attempt number three of my neighborhood experiment.
Obviously, I hope and assume this will be the final version.
No, I know it will be.
All the kinks have been worked out.
This is the one.
And after I pull this off, they're gonna hang my picture in the Bad Place Hall of Fame right next to the guy who invented bees with teeth.
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
Cool.
I'm Chris Baker.
I'm your soul mate.
Bring it in, man.
Sorry, I must ask, why are you wearing a sash that says "best person" on it?
Apparently, I am the number one points-getter in the entire neighborhood.
Is that so?
I always have to have my sashes custom-made due to my height and bosom size.
Also, apparently, sashes are out this season.
The diagonal line really draws one's eye to the chin bloat.
Go fork yourself, you mean giraffe.
Run!
Giraffes!
Giraffes!
Run!
Oh!
Mean giraffes are destroying the neighborhood.
Gah!
Oh, boy.
Hey, robot slave lady?
Busty Alexa?
- Oh, Janet?
- Hi, there.
Gah, still not used to it.
Hey, what if I, an already amazing person who definitely belongs here, wanted to learn even more about how to be a good person?
Is one of these nerds, like, a teacher or a life coach or an Instagram fitness model or something?
Eleanor, I'd like you to meet Chidi Anagonye.
Chidi, this is Eleanor.
Janet tells me you were a professor of some kind.
Yes, I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy focusing on deontology.
Hang on one second, Cheebee.
This guy's too big of a nerd.
Who else you got?
- Michael, what do we do here?
- I don't know.
Apparently, the Bad Place knows that one of you actually belongs down there with them, and they want that person to get inside the obelisk, or they're gonna take all of you.
I can't go.
I'm too young to die and too old to eat off the kids' menu.
What a stupid age I am.
I'd never survive down there.
They should take Eleanor.
She's a pear shape.
- She'd fit right in.
- Oh, excuse me.
You wish you could have a bite of this pear.
I'll go.
I deserve to go.
You guys can stay.
- Chidi, you're not going.
- No, I have to go.
Holy forking shirt.
You guys, don't you get it?
Michael is torturing us.
That's why our lives have been so miserable since the moment we got here.
This isn't the Good Place.
It's the Bad Place.
Ahh, farts.
Okay, attempt number 11.
Let's focus on the positives.
Eleanor always hates her house.
Tahani always hates Eleanor.
Jason hates being quiet.
Chidi immediately gets a stomachache.
So there's a lot to work with here.
Hang on one second, Cheeto.
So it's gonna be a hard pass on Superdork Jones over there.
Anybody else you got to teach me?
You guys ready for our lesson?
We're talking David Hume today, bundle theory of the self, baby.
Sounds like a real banger, but you guys gotta scram.
My soul mate has some sort of surprise planned for me, and he seems very excited about it.
Well, you two are certainly getting along very well these days.
Yeah, I'm actually kind of into Sebastian lately.
I mean, he's a little hokey, but he's growing on me a little bit.
My love, my sweet dewdrop I have written you a three-hour Spoken word jazz opera Cool.
Eleanor, less and more Who's it for?
For you, my dewdrop cream of the crop Top to the bop to the bop to the top - Okay, no, no.
- What?
No version of heaven for anyone would ever include three hours of this.
We're in the Bad Place, aren't we?
Damn it.
That was a real trip for biscuits, and now we're all wet, Daddy-O.
I never even got to play my stupid triangle.
No, no, no, no, Michael, please, please, please!
Please don't kill me.
I have so much to live for.
I'm sorry, Janet, got to reboot you every time I start over.
Oh, I know.
I'm not actually upset.
It's just the automatic fail-safe mechanism that kicks in every time you approach the plunger.
- Go ahead.
- Ah.
Michael, you monster!
Attempt 32.
Attempt 57.
Attempt 99.
Attempt 108.
I've analyzed some recent data.
Eleanor always seems to realize that they're in the Bad Place - just at the moment that - Excuse me.
Sorry, the door was open, so I just came in.
Did you just say I'm in the Bad Place?
Attempt 109.
I've closed and locked the door.
Uh, yep, and we're ready to go.
This is your soul mate Greg.
This is your soul mate Glenn.
This is your soul mate Tahani.
This is your soul mate Lerf.
This is your soul mate, a golden retriever.
Hang on.
Wait a minute.
You know what?
Holy smokes.
This is the Bad Place.
This is the Bad Place!
This is the Bad Place.
This is the Bad Place.
The pig's getting angry.
This is the Bad Place!
Bees, bees, bees, bees.
Oh!
Oh, this is the Bad Place.
Shh!
Michael, Michael, if I'm gone, who will take care of my birds?
Michael, no, no, no, no, no!
I I'm pregnant.
And it's your baby.
I have tickets to "Hamilton" next week, and there's a rumor that Daveed Diggs is coming back.
Janet, we've been through this hundreds of times.
I mean, can you just chill out?
Is that possible, Janet?
Can you just chill out a little?
Nope, it's gonna be the same every time.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
No, no, no!
No, Michael!
Please, please, calm down.
Calm down.
All right, okay, calm down.
Calm down.
I mean, why even bother at this point?
I'm obviously never gonna get it right.
"I'm Eleanor.
I'm so smart.
I'm actually in the Bad Place".
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
Shawn still thinks I'm on version two.
I just keep lying to him, and it's really bad, but I I mean, I have to keep trying.
I'm in too deep.
And I'm really fat right now.
I'm stress-eating, and I'm gaining weight in my thighs.
I mean, look at that.
Ohh.
So sorry.
Who are you?
And where am I?
It doesn't matter.
This one doesn't even count.
Hang on one second, Chili.
This guy sucks.
Who else you got?
I can hear you.
Michael, you simply cannot expect Chidi to decide whether Eleanor goes to the Yo, yo, homies, check it.
There's something messed up with this place.
We keep fighting with each other.
None of the TVs get the NFL RedZone channel.
My soul mate doesn't even know who Blake Bortles is.
I know this sounds crazy, but I think we're in the Bad Place.
Jason figured it out?
Jason?
This is a real low point.
Yeah, this one hurts.
Ow.
Okay, this might be the one.
We're a week in.
Chidi's teaching Eleanor, but she hates it.
Tahani still thinks that Jason's a monk.
Everyone's miserable.
I'm so happy.
Fingers crossed.
Vicky, where is everyone?
They're not coming, Michael.
You have lost control of this experiment, so we are on strike until our demands are met.
I speak for the entire crew, Michael.
We're sick of it.
We can barely remember what we're supposed to be doing anymore, plus I spent weeks perfecting this excellent Australian accent, I did.
And then I never got a chance to use it.
You're still upset about the size of your part?
Yes, I want a more important role.
But that's just my demand; all 318 of us have something we want to do differently.
Some people want bigger houses.
Gayle wants a different backstory where she was an MMA fighter?
Gunnar wants to bite and/or nibble on humans while they sleep.
You do know, Vicky, that if I were to do some of these that it would be a dead giveaway?
And I can help you explain that to them.
But some of these are doable.
And you're gonna do 'em.
So Aristotle believes your character is voluntary, because, uh are you ignoring me right now?
It's day two of our ethics lessons, and you're already tuning out?
No, sorry, I just got distracted for a second.
The last thing I remember you saying is nothing.
Can you start from the beginning?
Okay, I need a little break.
Can we take a walk or something, maybe get some clam chowder?
- Where is everyone?
- Who knows?
Maybe they finally figured out clam chowder is disgusting 'cause it's basically a savory latte with bugs in it.
Is someone smoking a cigar?
Michael really screwed this up.
The regular Bad Place was fine.
If the four-headed flying bears ain't broke, don't fix 'em.
What was wrong with impaling?
I loved impaling.
Hey, Todd, got a light?
Uh, yeah, obviously I have a light.
You know, you guys aren't supposed to be smoking.
You're supposed to keep your human suit on.
Those suits are really itchy for us.
Who even cares if they see us?
They're just gonna get rebooted anyway.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
This is the Bad Place.
I forking knew it!
And clam chowder is disgusting.
It's just hot ocean milk with dead animal croutons.
Okay, but what do we do, panic, freak?
I usually panic, but I am happy to freak.
No.
We have to stay cool.
As my mom always used to say, if a cop handcuffs you to a bike rack, there's always something you can gnaw through.
Your mom always said that?
Think.
Come on, brain.
- Janet!
- Hi, there.
- How can I help you?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
How do we know she's not a part of it?
We don't, but we gotta risk it.
Janet, can we, like, leave the neighborhood, get as far away as possible?
Is there anywhere we can go?
So we're in the Bad Place, and I know why: almond milk.
I knew it was bad for the environment, but I loved the way it coated my tongue with a weird film.
Who else is being tortured?
Are we the only two?
I got to assume Jason is as well Jianyu.
You know him as Jianyu, but his real name is Jason, and he's a dirtbag from Florida.
- What?
- Also, Tahani is a candidate as far as I'm concerned.
Yesterday, she told me that she was Taylor Swift's best friend but Taylor Swift wasn't her best friend.
She sucks.
No offense, but I can't believe you and I ended up in the same place.
Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either, bud.
I always assumed the afterlife was full of cool people, not talking sweater vests.
- You - We're here.
Aren't trains neat?
Choo-choo.
Hi.
You gotta help us.
I'm Eleanor.
This is Chidi.
And see, we thought we were in the Good Place, - but as it turns out - Yeah, guys.
I know.
You've been here 15 times already.
What?
Did you bring the cocaine I asked for?
Please tell me you somehow remembered this time.
Mama needs her medicine.
We've met before?
- I'm Janet.
- I know.
Vicky, let's look at the big picture here.
Now, if you all can just stick with my plan and we pull it off, we'll be heroes.
You could write your own ticket.
You might even land the Jared from Subway account.
Yeah, but I don't think you can pull it off.
You can't even pull off those bow ties.
That was very mean, but I'm gonna move past that in the name of unit cohesion.
You're gonna reboot those four dum-dums one more time, and then I'm taking over.
I'm going to execute my version of this neighborhood.
You see, I've been working on it while all of your versions fell apart.
This is insubordination.
And if you do not do what I tell you immediately, you are going down.
That's a complete report of every mistake you've made, every screw-up, every reboot all laid out in excruciating detail.
Now, I'm sure your boss would love to hear all about how "attempt number 2" is really going.
So actually, if you don't do what I say, you're going down.
Down under.
Is it always the three of us?
It's always at least Eleanor and Janet.
Usually Chidi's in the mix.
Sometimes Jason is here.
One time, Jason and Tahani were here.
But you know what?
No matter what the combo is, I always ask you guys to bring me cocaine next time, and you never do.
Do you have anything I can snort, like a crushed-up aspirin or some eye shadow or cocaine?
Still no.
There's only one question we need to answer right now, and that is, what do we do next?
I mean, this place doesn't seem terrible.
- Maybe we should just stay here forever.
- Maybe we should just stay here forever.
You always say that.
And you always end up going back.
I mean, sometimes you go back because you feel bad your friends don't know what you know.
Sometimes you go back because you walk in on me while I'm masturbating, and sometimes you go back because I walk in on you while I'm masturbating.
But no matter what, you always go back.
You formulate a plan to defeat Michael, and you head back.
Okay, a plan.
We need a plan, but - What if we come up with a plan - What if we come up with a plan - we've already tried before?
- we've already tried before?
- Will you please stop that?
- Will you please stop that?
Yeah, just to help you out a little, I've written down every plan you've ever come up with, which obviously never worked, because you're here, and you're back, so good luck.
"Physically attack Michael.
"Seduce Michael.
"Make Michael think he's the one in the Bad Place.
Catch that magic panda.
Use her powers".
Oh, I'm guessing that was Jason.
That guy has no idea what's going on.
Hello?
Hello.
Where is everyone?
- Janet?
- Hey, there, Jason.
Oh, hey, homey.
Uh, I mean Jason?
Who is Jason?
I am a monk.
You know what Can I talk to you for a second?
I'm in a tight spot, and I could use someone to bounce some ideas off of, okay?
Oh, yeah, real quick, you're really in the Bad Place, and you're being tortured.
What?
I know it says here that we already tried throwing Tahani under the bus, but maybe we should revisit that.
Throw her a little bit harder.
Maybe under a bigger bus.
What do you think?
I think this is pointless.
We're trapped in a warped version of Nietzsche's eternal recurrence.
Oh, cool, more philosophy.
That'll help us.
Well, don't you see the problem?
We are experiencing karma, but we can't learn from our mistakes, because our memories keep getting erased.
It's an epistemological nightmare.
Ugh, even your nightmares are boring.
You you are so mean, Eleanor.
You're just like those childhood bullies who said I would never get tenure.
And you are so irritating!
In one of these reboots, I probably strangled you and then went to the Even Worse Place, but you know what?
I bet it was worth it.
Oh, nice.
Ugh!
Sorry, can I just vent to you for a second?
Chidi is so annoying.
I just I cannot believe that he is the one I'm stuck here with.
Uh-huh, wow, crazy.
Oh, sorry.
Jeez, man, I thought you could be human for, like, two seconds and listen to me.
I have, Eleanor.
I have listened to you talk about Chidi 15 times in 15 different ways.
Let me just cut to the chase.
You two, you got it bad for each other.
No, we don't.
Chidi's just a friend.
What am I saying?
He's not even a friend.
He's just a weird teacher that I hate.
Dude, I do not want to watch "Cannonball Run 2" right now.
All right, what happened in the first one, so I'm all caught up?
I don't know what's gonna happen to us, but I need to tell you something.
I love you.
And you don't need to respond 'cause I know you have trouble saying how you feel I love you too.
Very funny, but that that's obviously not real.
Oh, that's real, baby.
That's real nasty.
Yeah, this was, like, the sixth time you guys were here.
I saw you getting sexy the previous three times, so I cut a little hole in the wall so I could tape you.
Call it my lookin' hole.
Is that a camera?
Mindy, you pervert!
How many times have Chidi and I slept together?
8 different days, but, like, 20 different sessions.
And how many times did we say that stuff?
Oh, only once.
Oh, God, I hated it.
It, like, really killed the vibe for me.
See, after I watch the porno I made starring you, I watch you talk about your feelings to cool down.
It's, like, anti-porn.
I've only ever said "I love you" to two men my entire life, Stone Cold Steve Austin and a guy in a dark club who I mistook for Stone Cold Steve Austin.
I mean, why would you show me that?
I don't know.
You guys are, like, trapped here together.
I feel bad.
You know, I'm rooting for you guys.
No, there is no "us guys".
We basically just met each other.
No, Eleanor.
You guys have known each other a really long time.
Also, it doesn't matter if I told you that or not, because when Michael finds out he's failed again, he'll just reboot you.
Chidi, Janet, we're leaving.
I am taking this with me.
Oh, no.
It's my only copy.
Don't.
How did it come to this?
I was just trying to do something innovative and different that would improve the way we make humans' lives miserable for eternity.
Mm, well Shut up.
What are my options?
Do I have any?
I mean, I can't go along with her plan.
It'll be a spectacular failure.
But I can't ignore her or she'll rat me out to Shawn.
I'm trapped.
You're saying a lot of words right now, and I only know some of them, like "rat" and "Jason," but I know a little wisdom I can give you.
I know everything that happened in your life, and it was all stupid, so I highly doubt that.
I was a member of a 60-person dance crew in Jacksonville.
We were called Dance Dance Resolution: We Resolve To Dance.
One day, Donkey Doug and I got into a fight because I'd framed his girlfriend for boogie board theft, so he started a new dance crew called Hashtag DougLife and immediately challenged us to a dance-off.
He said, "Meet us inside the abandoned orange juice factory at midnight".
That night, as the clock struck 12:00, me and my crew came together with a determination we had never shown before and slashed all their tires.
It was dope.
The end.
By Jason Mendoza.
You know, that inane story actually contains a bit of good advice.
Thank you, Jason.
You got it, homey.
I give good advice.
Guess that's why I'm in the Good Place.
Oh, there you guys are.
No, stop, no more lies.
Jason, get over here.
That's right.
We know his name is Jason, not Jianyu.
We know everything.
I don't understand much of it, but, yeah, I know it.
Your sick torture plan is not working, okay?
'Cause we keep figuring out your little puzzle.
We're winning, which means you're losing.
So you have two choices here, buddy: keep failing over and over or realize we're actually the ones with all the power here.
Yeah, no, uh We're on the same page.
- What?
- I want to team up with you guys.
What?
Why?
You do?
What?
I'm in a bit of a bind, and I could use some backup, or as Jason put it, um, I need a new dance crew.
So what do you say?
New best friends?
Stop it.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 We're on the same page.
I wanna team up with you guys.
What?
Why?
You do?
What?
I'm in a bit of a bind and I could use some backup.
So, what do you say?
New best friends?
You wanna team up?
You've been torturing us - and lying about it.
- Let's not get all caught up on who lied to who or which one of us created an entire fake reality in order to cause eternal misery for the others.
That's ancient history.
It was happening until 20 seconds ago.
The point is that circumstances have changed.
And now, all of us teaming up is our best option.
I love being on teams.
Oh, we need a team name.
Um the Bobcats.
- Great.
- Slow down, ding dong.
He wouldn't offer us a deal for no reason.
He needs us.
- Why?
- Because, as you said, you keep beating me.
Look, I built this neighborhood as a way to torture the four of you psychologically for thousands of years.
And you keep figuring it out and taking all the fun out of it.
- Fun?
- Today, there was a new development that really chapped my nips.
One of my employees is blackmailing me.
Vicky.
She runs the clam chowder place in the main square.
- A Little Bit Chowder Now.
- Oh, the place with the the chowder fountain.
No, that's Pump Up the Clam.
A Little Bit Chowder Now has the lazy river of chowder.
Ugh!
How did we ever think this was the Good Place?
Vicky thinks that she can run this neighborhood better than I can.
And she wants to start her version in 30 minutes.
I am supposed to reboot you, erase your memory and turn control over to her.
How are we supposed to team up with you if you wipe our memories again?
Easy.
I'm not going to.
You're going to act like you've been rebooted and pretend that Vicky and the others are torturing you.
But then, on your own time, in private, you can study ethics, ogle mailmen, - do whatever you want.
- Can I play iPad?
- Sure you can, buddy.
- Yes.
Guys, there's no debate here.
My boss gave me two chances to make this work.
Suffice to say, I tried more than two times.
If he finds out, we're all in hot water.
Literally.
They will boil us.
We will be the main ingredient in a chowder of pain.
Human meeting.
Bedroom.
Now.
Oh, yeah, um, that no stair thing, that was part of the torture.
- Let me help you.
-   Son of a bench.
- Anyone have any ideas?
- You know, believe it or not, I actually found myself in a very similar situation a few years ago, except in that instance, Michael was Javier Bardem and the Bad Place was Vanessa Redgrave's panic room.
Okay, stop talking.
Do not talk again for 100 hours.
- What do we do?
- We team up with Michael.
Okay, hot take, but I like your confidence.
- Tell me why.
- He has a bow tie.
Oh, no.
I always trust dudes in bow ties.
Once, this guy in a bow tie came up to me at the gun range in a Jacksonville bus station and said he'd give me $600 if I put these weird turtles in my duffle bag and brought them to Daytona Beach.
So I hotwired a swamp boat to Daytona and the guy paid me the $600.
My point is, you always trust dudes in bow ties.
Ahh!
Look, Michael's a liar.
I know liars.
It was my job to trick people into buying fake medicine and I was the top salesperson - seven years in a row.
- I thought you only - worked there five years.
- Proves my point!
This is a trick.
- There's no way we trust him.
- I agree.
He could be lying about this whole thing.
For all we know, you three are in the Bad Place and I'm up in the Good Place, where I belong, being tested.
- How would that even - I don't know, - but it's possible.
- Before we do anything, we need more information.
We should ask him every question we can think of.
- Yes.
- Yes, we shall grill him like the flank of a Niberian piglet.
I'm sorry, has it been 100 hours?
Okay, man.
We got questions.
First off, how can we possibly trust you?
You can't.
But you have to.
Logically, you shouldn't but you have no choice.
I mean, I wouldn't, if I were you.
It's a crazy thing to do.
- But you gotta.
- What happens if we don't?
Most likely, I reboot you once more, you figure it out again, Vicky tells my boss, he shuts everything down.
I get punished, you end up spending the rest of eternity in the real Bad Place, up to your necks in a volcano full of scorpions.
I'll tell you what I want to know right now before we go any further.
Did the Jacksonville Jaguars win the Super Bowl last year?
Oh, you're serious.
Uh, no.
Will they ever win the Super Bowl?
Jason, I can't predict the future.
But no.
They won't.
Okay, well I just have, like, 12 more Jaguar questions No, you don't.
Hey, Janet?
- Hi, there.
- Do you have something shiny Jason can play with?
How many different versions of this place have we been through?
Uh, let's see.
802.
The longest one was 11 months.
Uh, this current one has only been going for one week.
Boy, you guys barely know each other.
It's gonna make this tough.
What's that super tiny line?
That's the shortest one, eight seconds.
It was a butt reboot.
I sat on the activator by mistake.
Michael, was I also rebooted 802 times?
Yes.
Why?
Every time a Janet is rebooted, she increases her social awareness and abilities.
I might be the most advanced Janet in the universe.
So Janet isn't with you.
No.
There has to be a Janet in every neighborhood, good and bad.
This one is an actual Good Place Janet that I stole to help sell the ruse.
I guess it didn't work, though.
Because you keep failing.
- Yes, thank you.
- You're welcome.
If you're not human, why do you look like us?
Everyone in the Bad Place Bureau of Human Affairs gets randomly assigned a human body so we can get the feel of how best to torture you.
I gotta say, it took me a long time to get used to - the hanging bits.
- Gross.
Oh, get your mind out of the gutter, Eleanor.
I was talking about my testicles.
Mindy St. Clair's is fake, I bet.
No, the Medium Place is real.
So annoying how you managed to slip away from me - all those times.
- Why even tell us about any real thing?
Why not just lie about all of it?
Lies are always more convincing when they're closer to the truth.
That's true.
I crashed a lot of open bar weddings as Eileen Shelbourne.
Even dated a groomsman for a few months.
So I had to keep the name, and he got Eileen - tattooed on his neck.
- Seriously?
!
How are she and I in the same place?
- Oh, get over yourself.
- Trust me, don't trust me, it doesn't matter.
We're running out of time, and I'm your only option.
We're running out of time and I'm your only option?
A lot of guys your age said that to me just as the bar was about to close.
But I never settled for them.
Because my ex-boyfriend lived nearby, he was obsessed with me and he never slept because he was addicted to Adderall.
There is always another option.
You guys do whatever you want.
- I'm out.
- No!
My plan only works if all four of you - are on board.
- Then you better get cracking on a new plan, pally, because so far, I haven't heard a single good reason why I should help you.
All right, how about this?
You help me trick Vicky and all those other goons, I can get you to the real Good Place.
There's a way to get to the real Good place.
It's complicated.
It may take a while to arrange especially since I'll have to do it in secret but yes, yes, there is a potential method of transportation.
Wait, is it nice?
Is there a business class?
Can I pre-board?
Yeah, let's not worry about that right now.
I can get us there.
Us?
You, Mr. Diabolical Torture Guy are gonna try to join us in the Good Place?
Yeah, if I stay in the Bad Place, I'm doomed.
But if I rescue four pitiful, foul-smelling humans from eternal damnation hit 'em with the big puppy dog eyes.
Please, sir, take pity on me, I've changed and all that crap, maybe I can earn a spot, too.
We didn't deserve the Good Place based on our time on Earth.
Will they even let us stay?
I gotta be honest, I have no idea.
But at least if you help me fool Vicky, your brains don't get erased every two weeks.
Okay, all humans who have not already been suckered by Michael, another team meeting.
This is definitely a trap.
We figured out his game every time and now he's just trying a new way to mess with us.
Teaming up with a demon is insane.
Maybe.
But I think we have to do it.
Are you forking kidding me right now?
You take a half an hour to pick out a turtleneck, and yet this you're sure about?
Okay, look, I spent my whole life trying to learn about right and wrong and apparently, I failed.
I want us to get better and I want us to stay that way.
You understand that, right, Tahani?
I understand nothing.
Hey!
Same here!
Michael, there's been a mistake.
I belong in the Good Place.
The real one with the good people.
Who do I speak to about correcting this?
Me and you're wrong.
Very well.
I would like to speak to your manager.
Listen, sweetheart, you've only been in this timeline for about a week.
So I think I'm gonna fast forward things a bit.
There's a very good reason why you ended up here.
You never cared about the people you were helping.
You did it only for fame or status or to spite your family.
That is utter tosh!
I had my flaws, just like anyone else, but I raised billions for charity.
I was a good person and I defy you or anyone else to prove otherwise.
You know, in all the reboots, I never showed you how you died.
I was saving it in case I ever needed to really make you miserable.
But it's hilarious.
Of course, I mean sad.
But it might help you come to grips with who you really were.
Do you want to remember it?
Tahani Al-Jamil, social activist, philanthropist, neck model and now cover girl for "International Sophisticate Magazine".
- Tahani, welcome.
- Oh, it's such an honor.
I have long dreamt of being one of the women or yachts who grace your cover.
Let's begin with your sister, Kamilah.
A woman who as you know was offered the spot on our cover, but turned it down.
I actually didn't know that.
Please, carry on.
Well, next week, Kamilah will travel to Cleveland, Ohio to become the youngest person ever inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame.
Remarkable.
Is there a question?
Don't you find that remarkable?
Kamilah is very impressive.
As you know, she released her debut album only six months ago and yet, the critics thought it was so brilliant that the Hall of Fame decided to waive its 25 year waiting period.
Sadly, I will not be attending the ceremony because I will be in Haiti on a relief mission.
Perhaps we should talk more about that.
Perhaps we should.
But first, another question about Kamilah.
Don't you think she and I would be friends?
We have a lot in common, we are both Capricorn, and we're both only children.
I'm sorry, I forgot about you.
Kamilah!
Congratulations.
You have all the attention.
Once again.
- Who are you?
- Really?
Good Lord.
Tahani!
You're a cocktail waitress now.
Honestly, I think this is the right move for you.
No, it's just that my own sister didn't even deign to invite me to her little soiree.
So I had to weasel my way in here like some common weasel.
But I was supposed to be in Haiti being photographed helping people, but instead I delayed my trip by a day to come here and tell you off.
No, you came to do what you always do: make a scene and embarrass yourself.
So I'm just an embarrassment to you?
Is that what you think of me?
Honestly, I don't really think about you.
No!
Ow.
Thing just ah!
I'll bring you down!
I will bring you down.
Come on.
Come on!
Come down to the ground where you belong, will you  - Oh, no.
- Mm.
I died in Cleveland?
I don't think that should be your biggest takeaway - from that story.
- Is that really all I cared about?
Just outshining my sister and gaining praise and acclaim?
I mean, I did gain praise and acclaim.
You know, I dare say on some occasions, more praise and acclaim than my sister, Kamilah, so Oh.
Oh, I see.
- Oh, God.
- Oh, come on, now.
It's not all bad.
Imagine you're me and you're designing a torture chamber for people who think that they belong in the Good Place.
I mean, you were perfect.
But I've always wanted to be perfect at something I just never thought it would be the perfect stooge.
I want to do it.
I want to become the person I pretended to be.
I agree with Chidi.
We should team up with Michael and all try to build a better Tahani.
Great.
Yet again, it's everyone against Eleanor.
Because everyone except Eleanor is an idiot.
Why am I the only person who clearly sees - what's going on here?
- It's not that we don't understand the risks, we just wanna become better people and this is our best chance.
Oh, I get it.
'Cause you're so much better than me.
- That's what this is about?
- Hang on, don't lash out at us just because of - your innate distrust.
- Lash out?
No, it's not about who's better.
I have no idea what's going on right now but everyone else is talking - and I think I should too!
-  What is so funny?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be laughing.
How do I explain this?
I'm basically an exterminator and you're cockroaches.
My job was to squish you and poison you and yet, somehow, my very survival now depends on you, the cockroaches, agreeing to help me.
- That's funny.
- We're cockroaches to you?
Yeah.
Or dung beetles.
I don't know.
Something small and gross that creeps on the ground in its own filth.
- Just being honest.
-  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- All right, forget about him.
- Oh!
Forget about him, focus on us.
Kant wrote it is our duty to improve ourselves.
So whatever Michael's reasons for doing this, he's giving us the best chance to improve ourselves.
Okay, I have to admit, you're making a lot of sense right now.
I need to just untangle all of this.
Give me a minute to think about it alone.
Okay.
- Janet?
- Hi, there.
Call me a train.
Fill it to the brim with cocaine.
I'm going back to Mindy St. Clair's house.
- Gonna bail, huh?
- Hm?
No.
Why why would you say that?
Well, you got a bag full of clothes, you stuffed a bunch of pillows and a mop in your bed to make it look like you're asleep and you're literally sneaking out the back gate.
Okay.
I'm going to Mindy's.
I don't want to live forever in a boring, beige house with a weird, horny cokehead, but look at what you're asking me to do.
Make a deal with an actual devil so that I can then do homework in secret.
And by the way, you're not my friends, man.
We've known each other for, like, a week.
You know it's more than that.
We've been through some version of this 800 different times.
And who cares that it's only been a week?
How long do you have to know someone before you - do the right thing?
- Nine weeks, minimum.
- Okay.
- Look, bro, I don't owe you anything.
I gotta do what's right for me.
You can come with me if you want.
I got another mop we can put in the bed.
Good luck.
I got a couple more questions.
Sure.
Take your time.
We're not in a hurry or anything.
How many times in all the reboots did I ask Chidi for help, he refused to help me and then I had to get better on my own?
Never.
He always helped you.
God.
- Really?
- Yep.
No matter how I set it up, you found him, confessed you didn't belong, asked him for help, and he said yes.
Now his agreeing to help was part of my plan.
What wasn't part of my plan was it actually working.
Drove me nuts.
Pesky little nerd.
Stuck with you and always helped you overcome your biggest problem.
Assuming that's my selfishness.
No.
No, no, no.
It's that you never found a haircut that framed your face properly.
- Yes, your selfishness.
- I'm not that selfish.
Eleanor, your cocaine and escape train are ready.
- Not now.
- Okay.
I think Michael is a liar.
I think there's a 99% chance he's forking with us.
But he's asking us for help, so we should help him.
Because that's what Chidi would do.
That's what Chidi would do for me or for any of us.
- It's what I am doing.
- I know.
It's just you're talking about me like I'm not here or something and that just makes me feel weird.
All right.
We're all in.
We'll help you.
You finally listened to reason.
On one condition.
You wanna be on our team, you gotta be on our team.
Which means the professor over here is gonna give us all lessons on how to be better people.
Including you.
Oh, no.
No, I won't be taking any classes.
I'm an immortal being with abilities you can only dream Yeah, and we're in Arizona, dirtbag.
A human turtleneck, a narcissistic monster, and literally the dumbest person I've ever met.
And who am I?
Describe me now.
We are all going to take classes.
We are all going to improve.
And the second you betray us, I walk into Vicky's stinky chowder restaurant and tell her everything.
You agree to those terms, and you can join us on Team Cockroach.
So what's it gonna be?
You're running out of time.
And we're your only option.
So it's all frozen yogurt places now, huh?
Yeah, yogurt was what we started with.
A lot of us like the first version best so we went back to 322 perfectly matched human souls, blended together in a blissful, harmonic balance.
- Well done.
- I've only given this opening day tour to you like, 800 times.
Hey, how's this for my oh-my-God-I'm-in-Heaven face?
- Not bad.
- Right?
I'm a pretty good liar.
Now I wanna introduce someone that you're gonna get to know very well.
She was the top point getter, so she'll be helping me out around the neighborhood, kind of like your mayor.
Vicky Sengupta!
Vicky, would you like to say a few words?
Actually, Michael, I'd like to sing a few words.
Janet, hit it.
At first I was afraid, I was petrified Kept thinking I could never live Without you by my side We should have a few hours to ourselves.
Vicky's working on her performance for the welcome party tonight.
It looks like pretending to enjoy her singing is gonna be half our job here.
I got her to tell me how she was gonna torture you at the party, which is basically the same way I did.
Eleanor gets drunk, hogs all the shrimp, insults people, etcetera.
Whatever bad stuff you do becomes the basis for the chaos tomorrow morning.
Okay, okay.
So my job is to get drunk and insult people.
I think I can hack that.
Now, Chidi, I'm gonna need you to act nervous and embarrassed by Eleanor.
- Way ahead of you.
- Tahani, just be your fabulous self.
And Jason, you're good old silent Jianyu the monk.
So I told Vicky that I would handle the surveillance on the four of you.
That'll let us meet each day for Chidi's ethics lessons, which will apparently include me.
Even though that's transparently insane.
Cool.
And, um, Janet, you're not gonna - rat us out, right?
- Well, Jason, I've been thinking about this a lot over the last 1.3 milliseconds, I'm not allowed to lie, but my purpose is to make humans happy.
And since you're the only actual humans here, I'm on board for whatever fun little schemes you guys come up with.
Okay, bring it in.
Team huddle.
The Bad Place is about to be outsmarted by a cowardly traitor, four dum-dums, - and a robot.
- Not a robot.
We can do this.
Team Cockroach on three.
One, two, three.
- All: Team Cockroach!
- Bobcats!
I still think that's better.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1  You've got to admit things are going pretty well since I took over.
Certainly a lot smoother lately.
And based on my surveillance, our four humans don't suspect anything.
Yeah, because we're killing it.
Whoo-hoo-hoo.
You sure are.
Here are the torture ideas you asked me to write up for next week.
So long.
You're not supposed to be torturing me.
From now on, make all your memos one page max with pictures.
Also, Quinston over here already came up with a sick idea for how to torture Tahani.
Tell him, babe.
We're going to have Tahani throw a party for Gunnar's birthday, but no one will show up because we'll also be throwing a party, and it will be way better.
Boom.
Where do you get these incredible ideas?
Oh, that one just came to me.
It just like popped right into my noodle.
Yeah, that's right.
Up top!
So that's their plan.
This doesn't seem so bad.
It really tucks my nuggets.
I worked so hard on my torture ideas, and theirs are so basic.
These millennials, they have no work ethic.
Oh, sorry, a millennial is someone who has only been torturing people for a thousand years.
A millennial.
Okay.
Coast is clear.
Not a demon in sight.
Except for, you know Is that what we should call you?
"Demon"?
Well, I mean, it's not really accurate, and we consider it to be a little racist.
But it's fine.
Well, um, let's start our first lesson.
Tahani and Jason will have to make it up since they're both off being fake-tortured.
All right.
Well, I've read everything on your syllabus, and how do I put this delicately?
It's all, ah, stupid garbage.
Look, we have to start somewhere.
So how about Socrates?
All right, all right.
Let me just get into the mind-set of a human.
"Oh, I'm a human, "and my breathing tube is next to my eating tube.
"Oh, and look, my arms end in stupid little sticks".
Okay.
Proceed.
Good.
This is so depressing.
I'm being forced to throw a party that I know will fail.
That's why they're doing this.
It's what you're best at.
Just like I'm the best at getting empty water bottles to stay on the roof of a Pizza Hut.
You know what?
I am the best at planning parties.
Vicky may be some demonic torturer from the netherworld, but does she have taste?
Sophistication?
An encyclopedic knowledge of traditional and avant-garde Belgian floral design?
Yes!
She does.
No.
She doesn't.
What if I throw a party that is so amazing that it's actually better than the party that's supposed to win?
When they realize they could have to my party, they'll be sad.
I won't be sad.
They'll be sad.
- Janet!
- Hi there.
Janet, when I turned 18, I knelt in front of Princess Grace's dress mausoleum, and I swore to uphold the Hostess Code: "I, Tahani Al-Jamil, "shall do my level best "to make every event too much".
Model tonight's dÃ©cor after my 2008 fundraiser for the Red Cross in Zurich.
No.
Man.
Michael is not into your class.
Right now, I'm the best student.
I'm going to be the velociraptor.
You trying to say "valedictorian"?
No.
Look, dude, this isn't your fault.
You've been teaching him ethics for half an hour, and he's been evil since the beginning of time.
Oh!
Maybe the reason Michael can't latch onto the ideas is because he's immortal.
Look, look.
If you live forever, then ethics don't matter to you because, basically, there's no consequences for your actions.
You tell a lie, who cares?
Wait a few trillion years, the guilt will fade.
Before I can teach Michael to be good, I have to force him to think about what we used to think about: that life has an end, and therefore our actions have meaning.
That's what you used to think about?
I used to think about how it's weird they don't make pants that are just one big pant leg for both your legs.
You mean a skirt?
No.
You're not getting it.
And my thing is different, so shut up.
- Michael?
- Yeah.
Is there any way that you can die?
Yeah, actually there is.
It's called retirement.
It's rare, but when one of us really screws something up  And what happens exactly?
Well, it's fairly straightforward.
My essence would be scooped out of my body with a flaming ladle, and every molecule of my body would be placed on the surface of a different sun.
Sure.
So is that what would happen if your boss found out that you defected to our side?
Yeah.
Okay, so that might actually happen, and if it did there would be no more Michael.
Think about that for a second.
Imagine being retired.
Everyone else is here.
But you?
Poof.
Gone.
Nothingness.
Inky black void.
Done.
Okay.
I'll think about that.
Huh.
So you're saying that I would be No Me?
Okay!
Now we're getting somewhere.
Dude, you broke Michael.
No, no.
This is good.
He's having an existential crisis.
It's a sort of anguish people go through when they contemplate the silent indifference of our empty universe.
Look, the good news is, if he can work through this, it's the first step towards understanding human ethics.
And what if he can't?
Then, he'll be a lifeless shell of misery forever, and we're all doomed.
Okay, I will be right back.
Gotta go grab some Camus.
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?
Can I get you a snack?
Do you eat?
I can never remember.
What do you eat?
Babies?
Do you want me to get you a big fat baby?
What flavor baby?
How about a Cool Ranch baby?
Searching for meaning is philosophical suicide.
How does anyone do anything when you understand the fleeting nature of existence?
It's pretty easy, man.
I mean, you learn about death when you're a kid, and it's just not that big of a deal.
Eleanor, baby, I have some sad news.
Your doggie, Max, has passed away.
Do you know what that means?
Well, sometimes when a dog is very old, like, five or six or something, he crosses a long rainbow bridge, and at the end of that bridge is a beautiful farm with lots of grass and trees and, I don't know, wagons and a rainbow.
I already said "rainbow".
The point is: that's where Max is.
Can we visit him at the farm?
Nope, because it's very far away in Guam.
- It's in Guam.
- Can we at least Okay, look.
I'm lying, okay?
You caught me.
Congratulations.
The farm is made up.
The bridge is made up.
There's no such place as Guam.
Your dog, Max, is dead in a duffel bag under the deck.
How did he die?
The short answer is: I don't know.
And the slightly longer answer is: I didn't know how hot it gets in cars sometimes.
The point is: don't be sad.
Honestly, I'll get kind of annoyed if you do get sad because it's been a very long day and that bitch Carol from work was really on my ass about some stupid thing that I don't even know what it was.
And at the end of that long day, I had to use one of my favorite duffle bags to do something very gross that I did not like.
Now, let's celebrate that dead dog's life by bringing Mommy another bottle of white.
I would say I outdid myself, but I'm always this good.
So I simply did myself.
Everything is perfect.
Red alert, red alert.
We need help.
What's wrong with Michael?
Uh-oh.
I know that look.
He just snorted a bunch of printer toner.
Mike, listen to me, you have nothing to worry about.
You still have around 70% of your brain left.
No, no, this is more like a philosophy overdose.
Basically, Michael just smoked a big bowl of ennui, and now he's having an existential crisis.
So, we need to cheer him up.
Look at how pretty the restaurant is.
Didn't Tahani do a good job?
Parties are mere distractions from the relentlessness of entropy.
We're all just corpses who haven't yet begun to decay.
Yeah, but balloons!
Okay, we all head over to Vicky's party together.
We babysit Michael in shifts so that no one sees he's a catatonic blob.
Or you could just sit tight.
The entire party are going to be heading over here soon.
Unless I am sorely mistaken.
-  -  I'm taking you, baby All the way to lovey town I was sorely mistaken.
Okay, bud, whatever is going on right now, just shove your feelings way down deep, plaster on a fake smile, and pretend you're having fun.
Okay?
Just like I used to do when someone started talking about their kids.
Hey, welcome, guys.
Wow, this is elaborate.
Gunnar was an animal rights activist.
So the theme of the party is "animals".
Flying station's over there if you want to fly like a falcon.
And over there we filled a ball pit with puppies.
That's fun.
Oh, and have you ever wanted to sit in a kangaroo pouch?
My whole dang life.
So we can all hang out here for a bit and then we can head over to your party sound good?
Yo, this place is lit.
I'm going to go jump in that kangie's pouch.
Hey All right, Tahani, you just need to walk around the party looking miserable.
Great, just like that.
Perfect.
And then Chidi and I will keep an eye on Michael.
- Where's Michael?
-   Uh I think I found him.
There they are!
Que pasa, muchachos?
Hey there, bud.
You okay?
Okay?
I'm a new man.
Oh, Eleanor, thank you so much for the advice about shoving my feelings down deep.
I feel so much better.
It's like I'm surfing on this wave of positivity.
Is that Janet?
Oh, yeah.
Have you met my secretary, Jeanette?
She's a lot like Janet, but she doesn't pretend like she has all the answers.
Hi, Jeanette.
Oh, no, it's still me Janet.
Michael just asked that I change my appearance, and also say things like, "You're so funny," and "So how many quarterbacks are in a home run"?
Man, repressing your feelings is great.
I was feeling stressed all the time, and now it's just so easy.
Babe, we need to get some food into you.
Get you something to eat.
I don't eat anything.
She's perfect.
Hey!
Turn that around.
Throw them dice, baby It did kind of hurt actually, but I love it.
So he's moved on from existential crisis to just straight-up mid-life crisis.
That's good, right?
I knew a ton of guys like that back in Arizona.
I mean, they hit on you when they're drunk, and their breath smells like supplements, but overall they're pretty harmless.
It's Chinese for "Japan".
Oh, so cool.
No, no.
This is worse.
I mean, an existential crisis is an acknowledgement that life is absurd.
And that absurdity needs to be confronted, but this is just denial.
And at any moment that denial could collapse, and he'll be a mess.
He is a Jenga tower of sadness.
For an immortal being, he's pretty fragile.
I mean the guy contemplates his own death for one forking minute and completely loses his grip on reality?
You didn't have to come.
I said I'm fine.
Yeah, well, I know you guys weren't super close, but still.
It's hard losing a parent.
Eleanor!
Mommy's here, baby!
Oh, and who is this tall drink of wine?
This is my boyfriend, Sam.
Sam, this is my mother Sister!
Sister  It's not going to work.
It's my ex-husband's funeral.
Thanks for blowing my cover, Doug!
Listen, baby.
Don't be sad, okay?
Your father wasn't great.
Let's call him what he was: a fart in the shape of a man.
Can you just chill?
I don't want to turn Dad's funeral into a roast.
I'm not.
I'm just saying he sucked.
I mean, the only photo they could get of him was a mug shot.
He was a doof.
So don't be sad that he's gone.
I'm not sad.
I'm fine.
Good!
You know, I had a long running bet with Eleanor's father that I would outlive him.
You want to guess who won that one?
Come on, guess.
Well, we're at his funeral.
It's pretty clear I did!
I won!
He's dead!
Up top!
Whoa.
Is there a bar?
I'm just going to  Did my mom slip you her hotel room key?
Yes.
Yes, she did.
Thanks so much for coming to Gunnar's birthday party.
Now, there was a little bit of a mix up, and Tahani also planned a birthday party over at the restaurant.
So why don't we all head over there?
No need.
This party is far superior.
I'm sure yours is amazing.
Well, I did fine on the dÃ©cor, but I don't have, you know, actual unicorns you can ride.
So you all just stay here and have fun.
Okay, well, if that's what you want.
Let's all get back to the party, then.
Hang on, there, mis amigos!
- Whoo!
I want to make a toast.
- No, no, no, Michael, oh, boy.
Okay, I know what you're thinking.
Birth is a curse, and existence is a prison.
But don't think about that.
Don't be sad, you guys.
Focus on something great like Drakkar Noir whoo which I am wearing a lot of tonight.
Or the Sharper Image Catalog.
What can't those guys ionize?
By the way, I am feeling amazing.
I'm going to do some push-ups.
Then we'll go around the room and name our favorite cheese.
Okay, that's good with the speeches.
That's good, yeah.
Let's all get back to the party.
What was that?
You didn't run any of that by me.
Oh, I know, I know.
I'm sorry, babe.
Listen, when you guys first took over, I was upset, but it's all good now.
I mean, anger is toxic.
I'm not about that negativity.
Mi torture es su torture.
I am so happy you're in charge.
Okay, well, good.
Namaste, chica.
Do you want to dance?
- No.
- Okay.
I'm leaving.
I'm too miserable to stay here for one more second.
Why?
There are baby monkeys and dolphins to ride and the game of "Hungry, Hungry Hippos" with actual hippos.
This party is way better than ours.
Why are you miserable?
Ohh.
You stay and have fun.
I'm going to go and throw myself a pity party though I doubt I can even throw one of those properly.
God, I love this stuff!
Oh!
Let's keep this party going!
What now, huh?
Want to hit the clubs?
Oh, oh, oh Vegas!
No, no, no, even better Dubai.
Jeanette, make us a Dubai.
I kind of feel like maybe we should wind down, have a No, no, can't do that.
Can't stop moving.
Can't stop moving.
If I stop moving, I'll start thinking and if I start thinking, I'll start thinking about things I don't want to think about, like death.
Oops.
I'm thinking about it now.
Yep, thinking about death again.
Oh, I know.
Jeanette and I have been taking samba lessons, huh?
- Let us show you how to do it.
- Okay.
I think Vicky bought his excuse, but we need to snap him out of this.
Which one of these confusing French books will make him normal again?
It's not that easy.
I mean, emotionally, he's all over the map right now, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but I don't think this can be solved with a book.
What's the big whoop?
I dealt with death, and I was fine.
Were you?
I mean, you never had one moment where you were freaked out by the permanence of death?
Never one moment like that?
Hey, man, you got toothbrush holders?
Sure, yeah, right over here.
What's this?
Who has four toothbrushes?
Like, Bill Gates or something?
No, that's like, for a family.
Family?
Like, a whole family and their toothbrushes all together?
Two slots for the parent toothbrushes and two slots for their kids?
Yep.
So the parent toothbrushes can be close to the kid toothbrushes and watch over them and  They can all talk about their toothbrush feelings.
And they can hold their little toothbrush hands when they're sad?
Make sure no harm ever comes to their little bristles?
- Sure.
-  Oh, um, do you need Kleenex?
Thank you.
Sorry.
I'm so embarrassed.
A family pack?
I don't know if what I'm going to say is going to hurt or help, but screw it.
Do you know what's really happening right now?
You're learning what it's like to be human.
All humans are aware of death.
So we're all a little bit sad all the time.
That's just the deal.
Sounds like a crappy deal.
Well, yeah.
It is.
But we don't get offered any other ones.
And if you try and ignore your sadness, it just ends up leaking out of you anyway.
I've been there.
And everybody's been there.
So don't fight it.
In the words of a very wise Bed, Bath, and Beyond employee I once knew "Go ahead and cry all you want.
But you're going to have to pay for that toilet plunger".
I got you something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
I just want to sit and stare at nothing and silently scream for the rest of time.
I might be way off-base here, but you seem kind of bummed.
I really thought I could throw a better party than a magical, all-powerful being.
And moreover, what's this say about me, about the life I lived?
The way they're torturing me is through event planning mishaps, and it works.
Am I really that shallow?
Listen, back in Jacksonville, I was in charge of a 60-person dance group.
Whenever we auditioned a new dancer, we would rate them in five categories: dancing ability, coolness, dopeness, freshness, and smart-brained.
I would give you an eight in every category.
Well, eight isn't bad, I suppose.
No, no.
Eight is the best.
It was a scale of 1-13, but eight was highest.
The scale went up and then back down like a tent.
Why?
It's not important.
Lately, you've been really down on yourself.
But you're the most amazing person I've ever met besides Michael, and he was constantly torturing us so I'd only rank him a ten.
Which is worse than an eight?
That's so unnecessarily confusing.
The point is: you're cool, dope, fresh, and smart-brained.
I've never seen you dance, but I bet you're good.
'Cause you're good at everything.
You're awesome.
Be nicer to yourself.
Thank you, Jason.
From one eight to another.
"Excellent progress this week.
"Tahani devastated by party mishap.
"Eleanor continues to be a selfish monster creating burden for Chidi".
"Selfish monster"?
I brought you back from the brink of an existential coma, dude.
No, no.
I have to embellish your misery on these fake torture reports so that my boss doesn't get suspicious.
But really  I am grateful you pulled me out of my funk.
Well, now that you've become acquainted with existential crises, I thought we could read "Death" by philosopher Todd May.
Sounds like the perfect beach read.
Should we wait for Tahani and Jason?
Where are those goofballs?
So, um we should probably discuss That was awesome!
It was.
Surprisingly so.
But we should still discuss Want some breakfast?
I know how to make cereal.
- Sure, but, Jason, we should - Okay, be right back.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1 This is an exciting day.
We are going to tackle The Trolley Problem.
Is this a game?
I go first.
I call blue.
There's no this is No, this is a thought experiment first introduced by British philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967.
You are driving a trolley when the brakes fail, and on the track ahead of you are five workmen that you will run over.
Now, you can steer to another track, but on that track is one person you would kill instead of the five.
What do you do?
Do we know anything about the people?
Like, is one of them an ex-boyfriend or that snooty girl from Rite Aid who was always silently judging my purchases?
It's like, yeah, chicky, a Baby Ruth and birth control.
I see the irony.
Keep a-swipin'.
You don't know any of the workers.
Okay, well, then that's easy.
I switch tracks.
Kill one person instead of five.
But this is hard because the only trolley I've ever been on is James Franco's ironic trolley.
It travels backwards from his penguin grotto to his garage of adult tricycles.
- Um, kill one, save five.
- Good!
But there's a lot of other versions of this, like what if you knew one of the people?
Does that change the equation?
Or what if you're not the driver, you're just a bystander?
Or let's throw the trolley out altogether.
Let's say you're a doctor, and you can save five patients.
But you have to kill one healthy person and use his organs to do it.
But that's not the same thing.
Why not?
It's still choosing to kill one person to save five, isn't it?
Michael, you've been kind of quiet.
What do you think about all this?
Well, obviously the dilemma is clear.
How do you kill all six people?
So I would dangle a sharp blade out the window to slice the neck of the guy on the other track as we smush our five main guys.
Oh, I did the thing again, didn't I?
- Yep.
Ten more, buddy.
- People good.
People good.
Why is that so hard to remember?
People What is it?
- Good.
- Good.
Cool.
Later, guys.
Oh, hey, twerps, we have an hour before we have to pretend to be tortured by Vicky.
You want to hang out?
We could work on our forced grins.
Check mine out.
This place is miserable, etcetera.
- That sounds fun.
- Right?
But I was gonna dive into next week's reading, I'm afraid.
Sorry.
Jason, do you, um, care to join?
Sure, dog.
You're doing extra-credit work?
What can I say?
This class is more fun than I thought.
Eleanor seemed a little suspicious earlier, snooping around.
You didn't tell her about us, did you?
No.
Why are you so scared that someone will know we're pounding it out?
Precisely because you refer to lovemaking as "pounding it out".
Who cares about what other people might think about us being together?
Maybe you should talk about this with a friend.
But then that person would know we were together.
Right.
Then you can talk about why it is that you don't want anyone to know we're together.
But then that person would know, and I don't want anyone to know.
I know.
I'm saying you should talk to someone about how weird it is that you don't want to talk to someone about how we're together.
How's it going, teach?
Hmm, kitchen looks nice and crazy.
I've been racking my brain, trying to find a way to get through to Michael.
What do you think about writing a rap musical about Kierkegaard?
I think that's a terrible idea.
Cool.
-  - Michael's not going to learn how to be a good person overnight.
He's not even a person.
He's just a bunch of evil shoved up the butt of an evil mannequin, you know.
Teaching him to be good it's like teaching me how to be not hot.
How would you even do it?
You'd have me hunch or something and then stand there and say "gurp, gurp, gurp"?
I don't even know.
I can't even picture it because I've been hot my whole life.
I'm sorry.
Who is this conversation for again?
It's for you.
I believe in you, nerd boy.
If you can teach me and Jason ethics, you can teach anybody.
Thanks.
But definitely a no on the rap musical?
I mean, if we really  My name is Kierkegaard, and my writing is impeccable.
Check out my teleological suspension of the ethical.
- No.
- No!
Right?
No, it felt like a no when I was doing it.
- Janet?
- Hi, there.
If I were to tell you something personal about myself, you couldn't tell anyone about it, right?
Right.
So, in a way, you're sort of like a therapist.
Absolutely not.
A therapist is a trained medical professional with the ability to absorb and process complex ideas about human emotion.
I am simply a vessel containing all of the knowledge in the universe.
Close enough.
Jason and I are sleeping together.
Okay.
Obviously, no one can ever know.
I mean, I wouldn't shag Jason if he were the last man on Earth.
But well, he sort of is, and I am shagging him, I mean.
And I think I'm losing my mind, so please help me.
Well, my job is to make your experience here in the afterlife more enjoyable, so I will try to help you.
I am going to need some time to read every book ever written about human psychotherapy.
And now I've done that, so let's begin.
- Have a seat.
-  Hi, I'm your therapist, Janet.
I just want to have a little chat about your progress.
In the last homework assignment, I asked you to examine the ethics of "Les MisÃ©rables," in which a man steals a loaf of bread to feed his starving family.
Would you please read your first paragraph here?
"Everyone in this story sucks and belongs in the Bad Place.
"The thief is bad.
The officer chasing him is bad.
"All the whiny prostitutes are bad.
"Plus, they're all French, so they're going to the Bad Place automatically".
Do you see how you're already off topic?
Chidi, I've been around a long time like, all of it.
But I know for a fact that if you steal a loaf of bread, it's a negative 17 points 20 if it's a baguette because that makes you more French.
Okay.
Sure.
But philosophy is about questioning things that you take for granted, and I-I just don't think that you're doing that.
I mean, "I personally know that Victor Hugo "is in the Bad Place being tortured.
"He's a real wuss, too.
"If one of the lava monsters even gets near the guy, "he's like, 'SacrÃ© bleu, I peed in my pants.
'" I don't know what you want from me.
T-that's exactly what he said.
Jason's a nice person, but my suitors were always of a certain echelon.
I used what I called the "Duke Rule," because Duke is both minimum acceptable university and rank of nobility.
You've never dated anyone like Jason before.
I mean, I've dallied below my station.
I once had a brief fling with a non-famous Hemsworth brother, but even Larry Hemsworth had more status than Jason.
Jason didn't even have a job in a sad way, not in the good, rich way.
Hey, guys.
What are you doing?
Sitting in a room?
That's pretty cool.
I took your suggestion, and I'm talking to Janet about our relationship.
Actually, it might help me if I could hear Jason's side as well.
Oh, no, no, no.
That'll only slow things down.
Look, I'll tell you his side.
He thinks that I have to control everything and that he has no voice in this relationship.
Right, Jason?
Good.
Now, where were we?
I just heard that.
Okay, fine.
I'll leave.
I just don't feel like you're engaging with the material like with The Trolley Problem.
That was just tricky.
That's all.
Why don't you just tell me the right answer?
Well, that's what's so great about The Trolley Problem is that there is no right answer.
Ugh.
This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
I'm on your side here, dude, but he is not wrong.
Okay, Michael trust me.
When it comes to human ethics, I just know more than you.
I've been studying it my whole life.
It's just that it's so theoretical, you know?
I mean, you know, maybe there's a more concrete approach.
Here, let's try this.
Oh, God!
Michael, what did you do?
I made The Trolley Problem real so we could see how the ethics would actually play out.
There are five workers on this track and one over there.
Here are the levers to switch the tracks.
Make a choice.
T-the thing is, I mean, ethically speaking No time, dude!
Make a decision!
Well, it's tricky!
I mean, on the one hand, if you ascribe to a purely utilitarian worldview  Okay.
So what did we learn?
Chidi?
Talk it out, buddy.
What are we thinking?
He thinks he just killed a bunch of people with a trolley.
It's just a simulation.
I would never make you kill real people.
Oh, well, that's reassuring, because some of the parts of the fake people flew into my mouth!
Michael, can we just go back to the classroom?
We never left.
Here, I'll show you.
Look.
See, buddy?
None of this was real.
Well, they're fake people, but their pain is real.
Does that make sense?
There have to be stakes, or it's just another thought experiment.
This is awful.
You specifically asked me if there was a way I could connect with the material more.
I'm trying, you guys.
Sorry.
You're right.
I want to help you understand this.
Thank you, Chidi.
So let's try again, hmm?
Oh, uh, I-I thought maybe we would have a discussion.
No, the whole point is to play out the scenario in real time.
Quick, Chidi!
What's your decision?
Okay.
Okay.
I can do this.
I am choosing to switch tracks, so that way, I only kill one person.
Oh, forgot to tell you.
This is the scenario where you actually know one of the people.
It's your friend Henry there.
Chidi!
How are you, mate?
Henry, move!
- Oh, nice trolley.
- Move out of the way!
- Henry, move!
- I can't, Chidi.
My boots are stuck in the tracks.
- Henry, move!
- Anyway, long time no  Oh, my God!
Again, just a simulation an almost impossibly lifelike simulation.
Would someone's foot really fly off their body like that?
That was kind of cool.
Ethically speaking.
Tahani's confusing.
She's really smart.
And she's all soft and smooth like a bunch of water balloons.
But I tell her she's pretty a hundred times a day, and she's never said I'm pretty once.
And how does that make you feel?
I just feel like Tahani's embarrassed that I'm not some sort of scientist who forecloses on banks.
I need another session with Janet.
It's my turn.
I have a lot of problems, too, you know.
Perhaps we could kill two birds with one Janet, as it were.
How would you feel about giving Jason and me couples therapy?
I'd feel great.
Janet, what's happening?
Unclear.
My guess is I'm operating in a way I'm not designed for, and it's creating a small glitch.
But if I'm helping you guys, I say "What has one thumb and wants to keep going"?
This not-lady.
Eh?
Eh?
Okay, so that was Trolley Problem version number seven.
Chidi opted to run over five William Shakespeares instead of one Santa Claus.
Okay, as much as I'm enjoying watching random people's heads fly off, I think we've taken this trolley thing as far as it can go.
- You might be right, Eleanor.
- Thank you.
Let's try the doctor one.
Dude, what the fork?
These five people all need organ transplants, or they will die.
Eleanor's perfectly healthy.
Chidi, do you want to slice her open and use her organs to save the five sick people?
Chidi, Chidi, think about this.
I'm your hottest friend No, Tahani.
I'm your nicest fr No, Jason.
I'm your friend.
I-I won't do it.
As a doctor, I've taken the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm, and although five people will die, I cannot harm one innocent person to save them and forsake my oath.
It's unethical.
Okay.
- Tell their families.
- What?
Doctor Chidi?
My daddy needed a heart transplant.
Did you save his life?
He was working, then a really bad man ran him over with a trolley.
Oh!
Come on!
What?
I'm finding this incredibly helpful.
I think I'm really starting to get it.
Oh, I know.
We'll do the one where you're in a boat next to a volcano, and you can either save 50 people, or one awesome dog or whatever.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Hey.
Are you torturing us again?
What?
You don't care about learning ethics lessons.
You're just torturing Chidi again, aren't you?
- Busted.
- What?
I'm sorry.
Old habits die hard.
Not as hard as those people you crushed with the trolley, though.
Boom!
I'm sorry, is this funny to you?
Yeah.
I thought that was clear from my laughter.
Oh, come on.
My bad.
Look, I'm still on your team, okay?
I just needed to let off a little steam.
Phew.
See?
Back home.
All good.
No.
No.
Not all good.
You keep saying that we need you, or we'll end up getting tortured forever.
But then when we do help you out, we still end up getting tortured.
I'd rather just be tortured than choose it.
You are no longer welcome in my class.
Get the fork out!
- But I said "my bad".
- Out!
You okay?
You've been staring at the second page of this book for an hour.
When I'm really upset, concentrating on a table of contents helps me calm down.
It's like a menu, but the food is words.
Oh, okay.
I can't believe I actually thought he wanted to learn from us.
What he really wanted was to torture me, using the thing that I love most in the world.
Woven belts?
Oh, teaching.
Right.
I'm sorry about this, Chidi.
I made him take the classes, and I feel a little responsible.
Oh, no, it's not your fault.
Yeah, you're right.
It isn't.
And no take-backs.
No, a tiger can't change his stripes.
This is what he always wanted me trying desperately to teach him something that he never intended to learn so I'd end up miserable with my glasses all smudged up from sweaty-forehead stress grease.
Okay.
Gross.
Also, I really don't think that's true.
Oh, no?
What possible other reason could he have to behave that way?
Actually, I can think of one.
Yesterday Tahani gave us her reasons not to take this relationship public.
Tahani, what do you value about Jason?
Well, he's thoughtful picks flowers and brings them to me.
Often they're ones I've just planted, but That's how I know they fresh.
He's the least self-aware person I've ever met.
He has massive amounts of unearned confidence and is utterly unaware of his own absurdity.
Therefore, quite good at sex.
Here's the thing.
I'm nice to you, and you're mean to me.
There's something wrong about that, but I can't put my finger on what it is.
Oh, Jason.
I genuinely like you, but it's hard to change all at once.
Can you give me a little more time?
Okay.
I agree to keep this on the DL for now, if you agree to grab my butt in public once a week.
You can say I sat in gum and that you're trying to scrape it off.
You do sit in a lot of gum.
Aw, I'm happy for you guys.
Huh.
Look, I don't know what to tell you.
If Chidi can't take a joke, that's on him just like all that blood was.
I can't high-five that!
No matter how badly I want to.
Look, this isn't about Chidi not being able to take a joke.
This is about you.
You're doing what I used to do.
You're pulling an Eleanor.
Posting my cousin's credit card number on Reddit because she said I looked tired?
-  -   I forgot I did that.
No.
No.
Pulling an Eleanor in this case is lashing out when you feel like a failure.
You couldn't hack the classes.
They made you feel dumb and small, so you took it out on the teacher.
You think I feel dumb and small?
I'm an eternal being who can see in nine dimensions.
I can see from your aura that you're about to fart quietly and then lie about it.
And please don't, because I can also see what you ate today.
Dude, you can bluster and insult all you want also classic Shellstrop moves, by the way but deep down you know I'm right.
Whatever.
Eventually Chidi will get over it.
Ah!
Leaving it up to the other person to be the grown-up yet another classic Shellstrop move.
You and I are really very similar.
What does that say about me?
Ugh.
Look, bro, it's 100% on you to make this up to him.
I screwed up.
I'm owning it.
I mean, I'm a superior being I ought to act like one, right?
So I really thought about each one of you, and I got you something that will make you happy.
I call them "opposite tortures".
Do you mean presents?
Yes, that's better.
Thank you.
Tahani, here's yours.
Holy mama.
Is this a diamond?
Yeah.
Honestly, I don't get the appeal.
Diamonds are literally carbon molecules lined up in the most boring way.
They're worthless space garbage.
What you're holding right now that's basically meteorite poop.
And I have the biggest piece!
Eleanor I had Janet make you a never-ending shrimp dispensery.
-  -   -  - Oh!
This is the dream.
- It is?
- Yeah.
Jason, here you go.
Pikachu!
Guys, it's Pikachu!
- This is awesome -  Aw, man.
And finally, Chidi.
You were a tough nut to crack, but I think I figured it out.
This is a replica of a lost notebook from the desk of Immanuel Kant.
It contains never-before-seen thoughts and musings and several, uh crude erotic doodles.
Interesting guy, actually.
The point is, no one on Earth has ever seen this except for you.
Cool.
This isn't an apology.
It's a bribe, and I'm not interested.
Yeah, we can't be bought.
What do you want from me, man?
You want me to give you a golden nameplate for your office?
Or you want a diamond bigger than Tahani's?
No!
Then this would be worthless.
I don't want anything.
Oh.
Oh, okay.
Ah, I get it.
I get it.
You want me to admit that I was wrong.
You want me to say, "Oh, Chidi, I'm so sorry "because I didn't understand human ethics and you do.
"It made me feel insecure, and I lashed out.
"And, oh, please help me because I feel so so lonely and vulnerable".
Yes.
Oh, Chidi, I am so sorry.
I, um I didn't understand human ethics, and you do.
And it made me feel insecure, and I lashed out.
And I really need your help because I feel so lost and vulnerable.
Have a seat.
Whoo-hoo!
Nobody try mystery flavor.
It's white chocolate, and it is nasty.
Listen, we just wanted to thank you for all of your help.
Our relationship has grown so much stronger over the past few weeks, and we owe it all to you.
Congratulations.
I am very happy for the both of you.
- Okay.
Bye.
-     Hi, there.
What's happening?
What's wrong?
I am wrong.
I can't stop glitching.
I don't know why.
And it's getting worse.
I fear this neighborhood is in danger of total collapse.
So that's the main thing.
How are you?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1  - Hello.
-  So sorry.
To activate your Janet, press nose for three seconds.
Okay, okay.
Um, can you walk yet?
Here.
Oh.
Hello, I'm Janet.
Shh.
- Hello.
- Shh.
Hello, I'm Janet.
I really need you to shut up.
Where did you get this?
Did you actually get into the Good Place somehow?
Didn't need to.
They keep their Janets in a neutral pocket dimension beneath the shapeless time void.
It's right next to Accounting.
And you just walked in and stole her?
It was that easy?
You didn't have to choke out an angel or anything?
Doors were unlocked, no security.
I mean, it makes sense, right?
They're good, so they're stupid and trusting.
I understand that you need the four humans to think they're in the Good Place, but using an actual Good Place Janet seems risky.
Why don't you just have a Bad Place Janet pretend to be good?
I thought about it, but watch.
Bad Janet?
What up, skidmarks?
Let's try that thing again where - you pretend to be a Good Janet, okay?
- Aww.
Now, really really try your best.
- Fine.
- Say, Janet, where can I get some delicious ice cream?
Oh, there's a wonderful parlor in the middle of town square.
My favorite flavor is rocky road.
It contains chocolate ribbon, marshmallows, and your dad's salty nuts, you fat dink!
I see what you mean.
Use the good one.
Janet, you and I are about to have a real adventure together.
Wait a second, Janet.
What what are you What are you telling me?
Are you saying that because you're glitching out The neighborhood is in danger of total collapse.
Fun fact: mathematically, it's equally likely to either im- or explode.
Okay, okay.
So I suppose the next question should be, "What's causing the problem"?
Unclear.
The glitches started out small, and then began to escalate, and then I came here looking for help, and then I started talking, and then you looked at me annoyed, like that, and now here we are.
Okay.
All right.
Yeah, this is very bad.
Let's run a full diagnostic, Janet.
You got it.
A little short on time here, Janet.
It's just a little hard to get out.
Almost got it.
Here it is.
My user manual.
Okay.
Let's get started.
"Hello, and welcome to your new Janet.
"Janets are brought to you by the makers of light, darkness, and everything".
And I need to skip ahead here.
Where's the, uh, troubleshooting part?
- Michael.
- Hmm?
What's with the earthquake?
Janet's experiencing a slight technical issue.
Ew.
What's wrong with it?
Oh, um, uh I tried to eat some frozen yogurt.
It looked so good, but I'm not supposed to eat anything.
So there was a little earthquake.
See?
There it is again.
Can't you just reset these things?
What do you do again?
Oh, it's the ears, yeah?
It's it's, uh It's down, down, out Vicky, can I can I speak to you just for a second outside?
Look, this is a common problem, and I've got it under control.
I don't know, man.
First you went rogue at the party with your sports car and your weird earring -  - And now Janet's breaking down?
I mean, it's like you're begging me to tell Shawn that you're incompetent.
Begging.
Vicky, this is a temporary problem.
I promise.
Hey, you know who could use some torturing right now?
Chidi.
- Oh.
I love torturing Chidi.
- I know.
No, actually, I had this great idea the other night.
Thought it was worth exploring.
Picture this.
Needles.
Oh, that's the whole idea.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Needles.
- Genius, right?
- Yeah.
I mean, needles.
Oh, wonderful.
Wonderful.
- So smart.
- Yeah.
Needles.
Yeah, run with that.
Okay, hopefully bought us a little time.
Where were we?
Uh Oh, here we go.
Yeah.
"Glitches.
"In the event of malfunction, run the following tests/ First test, basic corporeal function".
Hop up on the table, there.
All right, great.
99.7 trillion degrees.
A little bit on the high side, but no biggie.
And still no blood.
Oh, thank goodness.
Okay, what's next?
"Summoning and retrieval.
"Have Janet produce an object using the random object generator program".
Okay.
A 14-ounce ostrich steak impaled on a giant novelty pencil that says, "Lordy, Lordy, I'm Over 40".
Here you go.
"Lordy, Lordy, I'm Over 40".
Perfect.
Okay.
"Third test.
Informational Accuracy.
Glitches may be a sign that" You didn't finish your sentence.
"Glitches may be a sign that your Janet is processing "or disseminating information that is incompatible with objective truth".
They're talking about lying, Janet.
This is all my fault.
I told you a lie that first day we met.
Okay.
Here goes nothing.
Hello.
I'm Janet.
And I have now been fully activated.
Hello, Janet.
I'm Michael, a Good Place architect.
One of the best.
Top notch.
You're in luck here.
Happy to meet you, Michael.
I will help you make the perfect neighborhood.
Would you like to get started?
Uh, one small note there, Janet.
Uh, the neighborhood that I want to build might be a little different from the ones that you might be familiar with.
Is that all right?
Of course, silly billy.
I build and operate the neighborhood, but every aspect of the design is entirely up to you.
For example, if you'd like me to stop calling you silly billy, just say so.
Yeah, I don't like that at all.
Michael's fine.
Sounds good, Michael.
I lied to you.
I lied about who I was and what we were doing, and then I lied a billion more times to support that first lie.
And now you're all discombobulated.
This is my fault.
Nope.
You're wrong.
If the glitching was only a result of you lying to me, why wouldn't I have been glitching all along?
Why would it only be starting now?
Well, that that's a good point.
I know, right?
-  - M Excuse us, Michael, but we've been trying to call Janet and she isn't answering.
Hi, guys.
I'm broken.
Uh, yeah.
I had to take her offline for a system check.
She'll be available real soon.
Cool, because I'm just so freaking excited, because Tahani said she's never had jalapeÃ±o poppers, and I wanted to get some for her.
They sound so disgusting.
But if Jason likes them, then maybe I will too.
Because we are together.
I can finally admit that.
Aww, babe, you admitted it.
That's sweet.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You two are sleeping together?
Only when we're done having sex.
Anyways, Janet, can you help us?
As soon as Michael puts me back online, I'd be more than happy to help you get that extra special gift for Tahani.
- Whoa.
- What's happening?
Oh, boy.
What the?
Oh, man.
We got robbed!
They took the walls, they took the floor, and we were standing here the whole time?
These guys are good.
Michael, what do we do?
Okay, there we go.
Nothing to worry about.
Happens sometimes.
Perfectly normal.
Let's go.
Is Janet going to be all right?
Totally fine, please just go back to your house and wait for her there.
She'll show up shortly with lots of jalapeÃ±o poppers.
- And cheesy fries?
- Mm-hmm.
- With donkey sauce?
- Sure.
- And a cool hat?
- Ding dong.
So I don't seem to be getting better.
That glitch appears to be limited to this building.
- So Vicky won't know.
- That's the good news.
The bad news is, I seem to be losing my ability to sustain object permanence.
So it's sort of a glass half full, glass stops existing in time and space kind of deal.
Okay, let's walk through what just happened.
Jason and Tahani came in, revealed the crazy fact that they're now in a relationship I already knew that, and I'm so happy for them.
Janet, tell me a lie.
Janets can't lie.
You lied to Vicky earlier.
Interesting.
I guess I did.
I suppose after 802 reboots, I must have gained the ability to lie.
That's fun.
I want to try to lie again.
I love your outfit.
"Incompatible with objective truth".
Janet, the problem isn't me lying to you, but rather you lying to other people.
Like when you said to Jason, "I'd be happy to help you and Tahani".
That was a lie.
No, it wasn't.
I'm always happy to help people.
- That's my main purpose.
- I know, I know.
But it was still a lie, even though you didn't intend it to be, because you weren't actually happy to help them.
Because you're in love with Jason.
Say what now?
After the very first time you were rebooted, and as you were slowly regaining your knowledge, you bonded with Jason.
The two of you got married, and I think, somehow, you're still, deep down, in love with him.
Ha!
No, that is impossible.
Think logically.
When was the first glitch?
When I said I was happy to give Jason and Tahani couples therapy.
And the second glitch?
When I said I was happy to see them embracing.
And the third glitch the earthquake?
When I said I was happy that I'd helped improve their relationship.
Ohh nuts.
Yeah.
But I am happy for them.
I am.
I am.
Am I?
I am.
I am not.
I am not.
I am not that.
I am not happy for them.
But how is this possible?
I don't have any memory of being married to Jason.
You said yourself that Janets get more sophisticated every time they're rebooted.
Well, maybe you falling in love with Jason was some sort of mutation that then was amplified with each reboot.
Okay.
That makes total sense.
I know what you have to do now.
Kill me.
Sorry, I say everything in a cheery manner, but in this case it may be inappropriate.
So I'll try again.
You have to kill me, Michael.
Better?
Janet, I can't reboot you.
That will just intensify your feelings for Jason.
And that's what got us into this mess in the first place.
I'm not saying reboot me.
I'm saying set me to self-destruct.
"In the event of continued malfunction, "hold down Janet's nose, and insert paperclip into small hole behind left ear".
Yeah, right here.
"Janet will rapidly collapse in on herself.
"When Janet is roughly the size of a marble, "she can be launched into space "through an inter-dimensional suction tube or eaten as a midday snack".
I'm very high in potassium.
Like a banana.
"A new Janet will need to be procured in order to return the neighborhood to functionality".
Easy.
I'll be gone, you'll get a new Janet, and everything will go back to normal.
Well, not for me.
I'll be a lifeless marble floating through space, but you'll be back to normal.
Are you sure this is what you want?
To self-destruct?
What I really want is to stay and serve the neighborhood, but due to my feelings for Jason, I'm putting him and everyone else at risk.
So it looks like it's  Adios, Janito!
Hey, guys.
Sorry to interrupt, um, but you didn't give me a heads-up about this new Vicky torture uh, the one with the needles in my face.
A little busy here, bud.
Yeah, totally.
Totally.
I don't want to be a nudge, but is there anything else coming down the pike that you forgot to mention?
I honestly don't know, but I have bigger fish to fry.
So you, know, just just walk it off.
I would love to walk it off, but my feet have needles in them.
Don't know what to tell you.
Okay, but Okay, self-destruct time.
Marbleize me, Michael.
It's the only choice.
I won't feel any pain or anything.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Kill I really don't want to do this, Janet.
But I suppose it makes sense.
Great.
Grab a paper clip.
Okay, that was the last pudding shop.
Great.
Should I begin to welcome the residents?
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!
No, this is all wrong!
Pudding restaurant?
What even is that?
Pudding won't work!
It's okay, Michael.
Just relax.
I can't, Janet!
My design has to be perfect for me to to In order to accomplish what I need to accomplish.
Oh.
Whoa, I'm way out on a limb here.
And I'm all alone.
No, you're not.
You have me: Janet.
I can help you.
It's too hard to explain, but there are certain aspects of my plan that that you just can't understand.
Try me.
All right.
Fine, fine.
Um Janet, uh What's a food that people think they enjoy but that's also kind of a bummer?
Frozen yogurt.
Oh, yes!
Frozen yogurt.
Oh, Janet, you're a genius.
Correct.
But why do you want a food No, no, don't don't worry about that.
Oh, yeah, okay.
Let's make all these restaurants frozen yogurt.
- Okeydokey.
-   Would you like to try it?
Oh, yeah.
It's just okay.
Which means it's perfect.
Let's bring in the residents.
I don't know what just happened, but I'm happy you're happy.
Michael.
Hmm?
Oh, sorry, yeah.
Yes.
Sorry.
Oh.
I can't do it.
Come on, dude.
It's dangerous, is what it is.
Vicky could find out, and then the you know, the plan, the whole plan It's bad for the plan, Janet.
That that's the reason.
I don't understand.
Given the situation, it's far safer to initiate the self-destruct.
Okay, look, see, here here's the reason.
See, I promised the four humans that we would escape to the Good Place once and for all.
And without you, we stand zero chance of ever making it there.
The new Janet will be able to help you with that.
Well, all right, but it's not only that, though.
See, it's also because of, um What if Vicky found out?
You already asked me that.
Why are you making such a big deal about turning me into a marble forever?
Because of reasons.
There are reasons.
They exist, and I just don't want to explain them right now.
What are the reasons?
They're reasons, Janet!
Okay, but what are they?
The reason is friends.
You're my friend, Janet.
That's why I can't kill you.
We have been through so much together.
I mean, yeah, sure, for you, you know, each time I rebooted you, you met me all over again.
But for me, our our relationship has become important.
You're my oldest, my truest, my most loyal friend.
I can't just get rid of you and replace you with some other Janet I don't even know.
Well, well, well.
Yeah, don't don't do that.
Lay off.
Michael.
That was so nice of you.
I'm glad you said that.
Well I mean it.
Look at us.
A couple old pals.
Trying to make our way in this crazy world that I built.
Two peas in a pod.
One of whom needs to kill the other one immediately.
Michael, come on.
Kill me.
No.
No.
There has to be another way.
This problem you're facing, it's about emotion, right?
That's a human problem.
So maybe we should consult our most problematic human.
So, let me get this straight.
You want me to convince Michael to turn you into a marble because you're causing earthquakes because you're sad about Jason to whom you were once married because he's currently sleeping with Tahani?
- Correct.
- I don't think I've ever meant this literally, but that might be too much information.
First of all, I totally get the Jason thing.
I mean, he's a ding dong, but also a straight hottie.
So, up top.
But more important, what you're going through is something every person has gone through.
Not a person.
Actually, right now, you kind of are.
Because you just found out your ex is dating someone else.
And, yeah, it sucks.
But trust me, it's not worth all this drama.
You just need to get drunk and go dancing.
You'll forget all about Jason.
- Can you get drunk?
- Not really.
Although, if I stand next to a powerful array of magnets, I do get pretty loopy.
Do that.
Pop a couple magnets, listen to some No Doubt, dye your hair.
You'll be totally fine in, like, two seconds.
I mean, honestly, the best move is to get another dude and just go to town.
Rebound guy.
But I guess here, your options are pretty limited.
- What about Michael?
- Extraordinarily bad idea.
Yeah, right.
Forget it.
But you don't need to worry.
You're awesome.
You contain all the knowledge in the universe, you have a rippin' bod, and you can literally do anything.
This is just a blip.
So, was it helpful?
Yes.
Eleanor told me that instead of being sad, I should go get it, girl.
So I'm going to go get it, girl.
- Get what?
- Unclear.
I'll get everything, just to be safe.
And I should be able to avoid glitches by watching what I say around Jason and Tahani.
Ah, thank you for your help.
I'm so glad we're friends.
Me, too.
And since we're friends, I can tell you this honestly.
Take that outfit out of rotation.
It makes you look bottom heavy.
It does, doesn't it?
Ugh.
If it's okay with you, I'm gonna go to my void for a little while.
I just need to spend some time alone and focus on myself.
Take all the time you need.
- Hi, there.
- Hello.
Janet, who's that man?
This is my new rebound boyfriend, Derek.
- I made him!
-  Hi, I'm Derek.
You must be Mich oh.
Okay.
That makes more sense.
You must be Michael.
Janet's made a lot of talk-talk into my ear holes about you.
Michael, Michael, Michael, Clichael, Clichael, Clichael.
Janet, you can't make a person.
I know.
But I did, though.
Eleanor said that, to forget about Jason, I should create a rebound guy.
Hello, I'm Derek.
So I made one: Derek.
I'm her boyfriend, and she made me.
He's so nice.
Whoa, look at this glass.
Oh, my God.
I'm in there, too?
What's going on right now?
It's my first time making someone, so he might be a little bit off.
Look, this could be no, please put that down.
This could be very dangerous.
It shouldn't even be possible.
Well, maybe not 800 reboots ago, but apparently now it is.
-  -  Can you believe this?
- Derek is it Derek?
- It's Derek.
Derek, could you please give me and Janet a moment alone?
Go back to the void, babe.
I'll be there in a minute.
Okay.
I'll miss you like crazy.
- I'll miss you more.
- No.
I'll miss you more.
Bye!
What a dork, am I right?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Go back to the void, babe.
I'll be there in a minute.
- Okay, I'll miss you like crazy.
- I'll miss you more.
No.
I'll miss you more.
Bye!
That's my first time making someone so he might be a little bit off.
Janet, you can't just go around inventing people.
Get rid of him immediately.
No.
Eleanor told me to find a rebound guy.
I couldn't find one so I made one.
He's helping me forget about Jason.
-  -  Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason.
Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason,  Jason, Jason, Jason - Honey - Jason, Jason, Jason Babe.
Babe!
Don't be jealous.
- I love you now.
-  We are going to spend every second together.
-  - No, no!
No, you are not.
Janet, no one can know about I'm so sorry.
What is your name again?
Derek Hoffstetler.
If anybody finds out about him, we are doomed.
He has to stay in your void.
It's our void now.
- We moved in together!
- What?
!
Can you believe it?
I got my own hanger for my jumpsuit.
Already?
I mean, that's so fast.
Well, when you know you know.
And we know literally everything.
We are so in sync, we're finishing each other's Derek!
- Hey, guys.
-  Michael, you frightened me.
Jason's making me watch this horror film about two ex-convicts who try to rob and murder a neglected a child.
Get over here.
Hey, I've got some great news.
I've arranged for you to have a weekend getaway.
I bet you're tired of being cooped up in this house, aren't you?
I am a bit, actually.
All this time indoors has degraded my skin from radiant to merely dewy.
Me?
Dewy?
Well, there is going to be plenty of sun and fun at the private campsite that I set up for you at the edge of the neighborhood.
Here you go.
I told Vicky that I'll be torturing you for the time being so just relax.
Live it up.
Out you go, here.
Now sadly, Janet is still offline so you can't call her, okay?
The best news is none of this is suspicious.
I don't know what's going to happen to us, but I need to tell you something.
I love you.
What are you watching?
Um, "Cannonball Run II".
Again?
You watch that movie a lot.
Well, it's basically my favorite movie of all time.
But you can never watch it.
This copy's mine.
Uh-oh.
I guess I'm still pretty selfish.
Help!
I need another ethics lesson, quick!
Very weird energy coming off you right now.
Hey guys, whatcha doing?
Nothing?
Great.
So, Chidi, just wanted to double check.
How do ethical philosophers feel about murder?
- It's frowned upon.
- Okay.
What if the reason you want to murder someone is to make your life easier?
That's okay, right?
Is there a problem here, bud?
Okay, I'll just tell you.
Um No, too hard to explain.
I'll show you.
Janet.
- Hi, there.
- Hey, there!
Who the fork is that?
Derek Hoffstetler, P.I. Derek is my rebound guy.
I made him.
Oh.
Did you do that because of what I said?
Yes, because of what you said.
- Janet - Thank you, Eleanor.
Thank you, Eleanor.
You know, you seem so sad.
Do you want me to make you a boyfriend too?
- Ooh, I could have a brother?
- Yes!
Based on your last 10,000 comments, it would be Stone Cold Steve Austin's head on Tahani's body.
Or vice versa.
She's not going to make you anything.
- Janet, that will be all.
- Okay, goodbye.
- Say "goodbye," Derek.
- Ah, good-bob.
I hope we same place again very now.
His brain is wrong.
- Mmm.
- Mm.
Now, the goal is to tap the ball hard enough that it goes through the wicket but not so hard that it goes too far through.
It combines both classic aspects of British sport: whimsy and restraint.
Oh, so restrained.
I believe it was Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain who called croquet "barely a game".
It's kind of fun I guess, but can I teach you a different game?
In this one, you just whack it as hard as you can in whatever direction you want.
Jaguars rule!
The Jaguars are very good.
Oh!
Whoa, nice.
Mmm.
- Thor!
- Well done.
Okay, here's where I am on this: We gotta to kill Derek.
No, think about it.
What if Vicky calls for Janet, and Derek shows up too?
She's got to have a lot of questions that we can't answer.
But Derek does seem to be helping Janet get over Jason.
Right?
No earthquakes since he showed up.
If we get rid of Derek, then maybe Janet will start glitching again Okay, if we can't kill Derek, then we've got to break up Jason and Tahani.
If that relationship ends, then Janet won't feel sad anymore, and maybe she'll get rid of Derek herself.
Girl, you are a messy bench who loves drama, - and I am into it.
- I'm sorry, Michael, but that's also ethically kind of dicey.
Here comes the egghead.
Well, look, Jason and Tahani are happy together, and telling them that he was once married to Janet might cause them harm.
It's not permissible to ruin their happiness to save ourselves.
Wait, but isn't keeping a secret from someone basically like lying though?
No, no, it's okay to keep a secret as long as that secret isn't harming anyone, and telling them that secret might cause harm.
- Noice!
- Cool.
Good point, egghead.
I'll tell you what else would cause them harm, getting caught and being sent to the real Bad Place to be tortured for eternity, which will happen if Derek blows our cover.
I know, but we'll also be sent to the real Bad Place if we do bad things.
I know it's tempting to take a short-cut, but moral strength is defined by how we behave in times of stress.
Has anyone ever told you what a drag you are?
Everyone.
Constantly.
I hereby pronounce you King Jason.
Dope.
Where did you learn how to do this?
The Hertfordshire Academy for Expressionless Girls.
It was a finishing school I attended before Oxford, and then, of course, the Sorbonne.
Do you know what, I don't think I ever asked you were educated.
I went to Lynyrd Skynyrd High School in Northeast Jacksonville, which was really just a bunch of tugboats tied together.
Didn't you get seasick?
No, sorry they were tied together in a junk yard.
It wasn't a very good school.
For most of my classes, we just sold dirty magazines door-to-door.
You know, Jason, every single detail about your life is deeply disturbing.
And yet, I envy you.
I was never allowed to goof off.
Never even had a friend I could just be myself around.
Maybe I can be that friend.
Or your husband.
Okay, stop it.
No, no, no, I'm serious.
Will you marry me?
I say we just let sleeping dogs lie.
Tell Janet that Derek can stay, but she's got to keep him under wraps so that none of the other demons find out.
Fine.
As long as they fly under the radar and Janet stays happy, I think we'll be safe.
- Janet.
-  - How could you do this.
- You don't respect me, and you never have!
Because to you I will always be that guy you made.
- Guys, what's going?
- Okay, can we not do this in front of my friends?
Oh, so they're your friends now.
I'm stating a fact.
They are your friends!
I don't know these people.
I am out of here.
Oh, great, Derek.
I'm going to go back to our void, and I'm going to try to forget this ever happened.
It is not your void.
It is my void.
I know it's a boundless, barren nothingness, but you are always there.
Fine.
I'll go somewhere else.
- Fine!
- No, no, not fine.
Don't go somewhere else.
Okay yeah We're forked here, aren't we?
Look, Jason, you're lovely, and I've honestly had a wonderful time with you these past few weeks, but why on Earth would I marry you?
Well, for one thing, we're not on Earth.
Decent point.
Also, we like each other, and I promise to always be nice to you.
Okay.
I'll marry you.
But I need some time to plan a proper reception.
I mean, where will everyone sit?
Will it be Michael and Janet opposite Chidi and Eleanor or Michael and Eleanor opposite Janet and Chidi?
Let's have it today at the beach.
The beach is where all the best stuff happens like swimsuit issues and "Saving Private Ryan" and "Jersey Shore" and - crabs!
- Okay.
Oh, I hope Janet's back online.
- Janet.
- Hi, there.
Is everything all right, Janet?
Yeah, mm-hmm, everything is fine, it's okay, yeah.
I'm fine.
So, it's all fine.
How can I help you?
-  - There he is!
Derek.
How are you?
Nice to meet you.
Derek, get down from there.
I am not coming down because I meant to come here.
I came here on purpose because this tree is my new house.
This is Derek's house, and Janet's not allowed in because I booby trapped it.
- Hi.
- Janet!
Oh, my God, you're here, thank God.
Derek, I am not talking to you right now.
I'm here to announce that Jason Mendoza and Tahani Al-Jamil are getting married this evening.
"The ceremony will be private, "but we think it would be totally dope "if you biz-natches came and got turnt up with us afterward".
I think I can guess who wrote the invitation.
How come you never get this upset at anything I do, Janet?
Do not start with me right now, Derek.
Oh, I will start it.
- No, no.
- Don't.
Do not avoid me by going to the void.
- No, no!
- No, no, no!
- What a little bench!
-  Things are falling apart here.
Chidi I understand the ethics involved, but we need to stop that wedding.
We break up Jason and Tahani.
Janet stops being sad.
Derek goes away.
- Fine, but -  There is something called the Doctrine of Double Effect.
In order to remain ethical, you can't just go into this with the intention of killing Derek.
Your only goal has to be to spare Jason and Tahani from future pain by filling them in on Jason's past.
No, I got you, I got you.
So, it's like ethically we should tell Jason that he used to be married to Janet, and it sure would be terrible if that ultimately led to Derek's death, wink.
No, the winking is bad.
You should not be winking or saying the word "wink".
Okay.
We really need to kill We really need to kill any suspicion that I want to murder Derek.
Boom!
- Wink.
- No.
Tahani, you're so smart.
Every day you teach me something new about art and history and why you shouldn't eat everything that smells good because sometimes, it's candles.
You're basically, like, a hot genius teacher who sometime has sex with me, your student.
That used to happen a lot at Lynyrd Skynyrd High School, but this time you won't be arrested.
Oh, I love you, Tahani.
Pew!
Pew!
Jason I'd never guess we would be where we are today, me, a prominent British philanthropist with award-winning legs set to marry you, a swamp dweller who once asked me if the Presidents on Mount Rushmore have butts on the other side.
We don't make any sense together, and yet, when I'm with you, I can really let my hair down, metaphorically speaking of course, because I'd never have it up in the first place.
I'm not a factory worker.
But you've helped me to see that there is more to life than just appearances, and I can't believe I'm about to say this but - I think I love - Wait!
Stop the ceremony!
- This wedding cannot happen.
- This is not helpful, but I have always wanted to be a part of a wedding that was stopped dramatically.
We can't get married?
Why not?
Because Because Hang on a second.
I can't do it.
Professor Buzzkill got in my head.
I'm just thinking about all the rules I have to follow to stay ethical.
Someone else is going to have to do this.
- I can't, no - All right, all right.
I hate the be the bearer of bad news Uh, I think you mean "Bad News Bear".
Before all the reboots, Jason was married to Janet.
Okay?
That's why Janet's been glitching because she's sad 'cause she misses Jason, In fact, she was so sad she Well Derek.
Well, well, well.
Jason Mendoza.
At last we meet.
You've got a lot of nerve buddy.
No, no.
I'm Eleanor, man.
Everybody, this is Derek.
Janet made Derek as a boyfriend to try and rebound from Jason.
Oh, I feel quite light-headed.
Janet, fetch my tizzy couch please.
Decision time.
Any second now someone is going to realize we're all missing.
Why don't you just reboot all of us?
Tahani and Jason will forget they were ever in love.
It was a flukey thing.
It probably won't happen again, and Chidi and I can forget anything we want to forget.
You know, just like, uh personal bloopers that were embarrassing or uh, days we were very gassy, et cetera.
And then, we'll meet back in your office.
You bring us up to speed, and we go from there.
No, no, no, we are not starting over.
We've come too far.
Our only options are to reboot either Janet or Derek.
Neither one is permissible as your primary intention.
I mean, the Doctrine of Double Effect, remember?
Well, man, I'm working with a doctrine of not being completely effed, okay?
I don't understand what you even like about Jason.
What does he have that I don't have?
A soul and genitals.
Here we go with this whole "no genitals" thing again.
You're the one that gave me wind chimes instead of a penis, Janet.
This isn't about your wind-chime penis.
In fact, it's not about you at all.
I don't even know what it is about which is very confusing because the whole point of me is that I know everything!
Janet, can I speak to you alone for a second?
Okay, look, when you said you were sad about Jason and I suggested, "hey, find a rebound guy," it's 'cause I thought it was some sort of schoolgirl crush, like, just some guy you made out with a couple of times in the walk-in freezer of a Bruegger's Bagels.
- Not based on a real example.
- Yes, it is.
His name was Marcus Bitsburger.
Marcus?
I always called him Ben.
Look, I gave you bad advice, okay?
Jason was clearly important to you, and real heartbreak doesn't have a simple cure.
I mean, you will feel better after some time goes by.
I don't really experience the passage of time.
I do use it as lotion occasionally.
I mean, weird, but keep doing it because your skin looks amazing.
Thank you.
Not skin.
The point is, to get through a real heartbreak, you kind of just have to sit with your feelings and mull it over and power through.
And you have to talk about it.
Talking about your feelings is the worst.
It's so much easier just to find a rebound guy and have sex about your feelings.
I don't know if I want to talk to Jason right now.
That's cool.
Until then If you ever need a friend to talk to Just know I'm here.
Derek.
There's no easy way to say this.
- I never should have made you.
-  I think it's time for you to go away.
I understand because you understand.
Janet, this relationship has been the best seven hours of my whole life.
It's been the only seven hours of my whole life.
I made you this morning.
We all remember.
- Okay, you ready to do this?
- Yep.
Janet.
- What are you doing?
- I imbued Derek with some of my thoughts and emotions.
This is the only way I can reabsorb them.
It will just be a minute.
Dang it.
That is some hot reabsorbing.
Can you get pregnant from reabsorbing?
Uh-oh, I hear wind chimes.
Look away.
Everybody look away.
I'm going to keep watching, but you guys look away.
-  - Goodbye, Derek.
Goodbye, mommy-girlfriend.
Bye, everybody.
Derek's going away now.
Does he seem a little bit uh still alive?
Well, he's about as dead as he can be.
Kind of like he's in power-saver mode.
Derek.
Are you worried you might start glitching again?
No, I think I'll be okay now that I understand what I'm going through, and now that I know I can talk to my friends about it.
Okay, I'm going to toss this steamer trunk containing the lifeless husk of my ex-boyfriend into a remote corner of my limitless void.
- Bye, guys.
- Derek!
I'm kind of glad we didn't get married today.
Me too.
Perhaps we were rushing things a bit.
I mean, we don't even know that much about each other.
Like, who was the first person you kissed?
The sexy mouse robot in the Chuck E. Cheese band.
Okay, okay.
I think that's probably enough getting to know each other for now.
We'll just take things slow.
I know I'm technically married to Janet, but I don't remember it at all.
I'm sorry that it puts you in a weird position, and I still like you a lot.
Me too.
What happens now?
Don't know.
Do you want to try reabsorbing me?
- Is something wrong?
- No.
Yep.
I've been keeping a secret from you.
- About you.
- What is it?
The thing is, it's not even harming you, and if I tell you, I feel like it might harm you.
So, uh, ethically speaking, I don't think I have to tell you.
Yeah, well, forget all that.
This is freaking me out.
I'm losing my mind.
So just tell me.
And you don't need to respond because I know you have trouble saying how you feel I love you too.
I've never been that certain about anything.
I once even tried to rent socks.
How did I say that that easily.
I mean, I get how you said it.
I'm a total smokeshow.
But how did I say it so easily?
Look, I don't want to talk about this, but after everything that's happened today, I think we gotta.
So, let's just get it all out there.
Um Well, yeah, I guess, do you I don't know do you have any feelings like that for me again, now?
I'm sorry, but I don't think I do?
Sorry?
Why are you sorry?
'Cause I'm relieved, because I don't either.
So, all good.
I mean, I feel incredibly close to you No, no, no, no dude, dude you don't need to explain yourself.
We are on the same page, okay?
Good.
Hey guys, sorry.
I know it's late.
Can I talk to Eleanor for a second?
Actually, we're chatting about something right now.
No, it's cool.
We were wrapping it up.
Good talk, bro.
- What's on your mind?
- Um, well being ethical it's hard, and I kind of hate it.
When's it get easier?
Why don't you ask Chidi?
He's the ethics master.
I'm just a newbie, and I still kind of suck at it.
Yeah, that's why I'm asking you.
I designed this entire torture chamber around the absolutely certainty that when the going got tough, you would give up.
That was the signature Shellstrop move.
Do you remember once when your change oil light came on?
You just abandoned your car in a parking garage.
Of course.
But here, faced with the toughest challenges I could throw at you, you never once stopped trying to become a better person.
And I just Why?
I don't know.
I mean, whenever I would do something crappy on Earth, there would be a little tiny voice in the back of my head that would say, "Eleanor, "don't grab that handful of olives from the salad bar.
You know, you didn't pay for that," or "Eleanor, don't spit those olive pits onto the floor of the grocery store.
That's not cool".
Or "Eleanor, that old man just slipped on your olive pit, "and he fell down.
"Don't use the fact that everyone's distracted to go back and steal more olives".
- I get it.
- This ethics stuff, it's hard, and it's confusing.
It is such a buzzkill.
But, it does get rid of the little voice.
Because at least I'm trying to do the right thing instead of the crappy thing, and I've got to say, man, I don't miss the little voice.
Well Thank you for helping me today.
Wow.
You really did just come here to chat, didn't you?
Just shootin' the shirt with your old pal Eleanor.
I guess so, yeah, why?
It's just a very human-y thing to do.
Stick with the program, demon buddy.
I really feel like things are starting to click in our little study group.
Hmm.
Hello, Michael.
Shut the door.
Have a seat.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1 I know you have trouble saying how you feel.
I love you too.
I've never been that certain about anything.
I once even tried to rent socks.
Do you have any feelings like that for me again now?
I'm sorry, but I I don't think I do.
Thank you for helping me today.
You really did just come here to chat, didn't ya?
It's just a very humany thing to do.
I really feel like things are starting to click in our little study group.
Hm.
Hello, Michael.
Shut the door.
Have a seat.
When you proposed this new form of torture, we all laughed behind your back.
Some people called you names, like "the Thomas Edison of incompetence," or "that dick".
But against all odds, it seems you've pulled it off.
What you've done here is truly amazing.
- Really?
- Yes, these reports are remarkable.
Your humans are experiencing emotional torture at the same level of physical torture, created by our squiggliest eyeball corkscrews.
I'm jubilant.
As a result of our success, I'm getting a seat on the High Council.
We will greatly expand our neighborhood idea, and you will oversee the entire project.
You are being promoted.
Your Senior Staff pin.
Congratulations.
This is everything you've ever wanted.
No, this is everything I've ever wanted.
Oh!
This is everything I've ever wanted.
Oh, wow!
You're really happy?
Can't you tell?
I'm basically squealing like a birthday girl.
At some point, we should finish discussing yesterday's events.
Do you mean us almost getting married and then finding out I was married to Janet and then Janet making a boyfriend to forget me and then Janet getting rid of that boyfriend?
Or do you mean when we saw that cool cloud?
The first bit.
Perhaps later after Michael briefs us on how we're gonna be fake-tortured today, we can just sit down and have a chat?
Yes, good idea.
- Yo, Chidi.
- Yeah?
You wanna hear about a cool cloud I saw?
Come in.
I'd like to start by saying something I've wanted to say for a very long time.
Surprise, idiots!
You're all in the Bad Place.
That's right, nerds.
Everything around you, all you can see, is an elaborate system of torture designed just for you.
Sorry, we're in the Bad Place?
Why are you revealing this now?
Well, it was an experiment, and it worked, so my boss is promoting me.
Sorry, I should've introduced you.
This is my boss, Shawn.
Hello, imbeciles.
We need to study everything that happened here.
There was a first version that collapsed, but the second has been a huge success.
We'll be shutting this place down.
The four of you will be brought to the real Bad Pace, where your brains will be removed, studied, and batted around a stadium like beach balls.
Your arms will be peeled like bananas.
- That part's just for fun - Right.
And then you will be, you know, tortured forever.
Michael, is this all true?
Yes, Eleanor, it is.
You're such a rube, thinking you could become a better person.
You got Chidi to teach you stupid philosophy  Like those old farts were gonna provide guidance.
"Oh, Kierkegaard is so great.
Have you read 'Fear and Trembling'"?
Well, I don't know, have you read "Boring and Stupid"?
Because that's what you are.
- Nice.
- Thank you.
How long will it take you to shut down the neighborhood?
Better part of a day, I'd guess.
In the meantime, why don't we have a farewell party here tonight?
You know, just to thank the crew for all the hard work.
We could jam to some tunes, you know, destroy the place, play beer pong with Jason's testicles.
- What do you say, boss?
- Sure.
By the way, I know what you're thinking.
- "Maybe Janet can help".
- Ah.
You're wrong.
Janet?
Oh, hi, you little cuties.
I love you guys so much, except for you, Jason, because I hate you.
- I hate you.
- Janet, what's wrong?
Ooh!
Where's my phone?
We put a restraining bracelet on her, disrupting her powers.
It's made of mag-a-nets.
Mag-a-nets.
- Mag-a-ne-its.
-  Magnets are supposed to make me feel drunk, but guess what, I feel fine.
I can't believe Michael betrayed us again.
Why is it always the ones you most expect?
We should've seen this coming.
No one can ever truly turn over a new leaf.
Sure, Ben Affleck told me he'd matured as an artist after he directed "Argo," but then, right on schedule, it was, "Guess what, Tahani, I'm gonna be Batman".
There's only one option.
Sean clearly doesn't know that Michael has rebooted this neighborhood 800 times.
I say we trade that information for some kind of reduced sentence.
Chidi, they're monsters.
Who's to say they won't agree to a deal, hear what we have to say, and turn around and install us into their horrible human zoo?
There's no other option.
There's no way for a human to get that bracelet off of Janet.
But if there were, we could get her to call us a train to Mindy St. Claire's house.
We know for a fact that the people from the Bad Place can't follow us there, and I vote for that.
I vote we No, sorry, and no offense, Jason, but the stakes here are too high to let someone with your limited intellectual processing capacity weigh in.
- I was gonna agree with you.
- Oh, great, well, that's two votes for my plan.
Eleanor, what do you think?
Trade information on Michael or try to escape to the Medium Place?
Neither.
I vote we ignore everything Michael just said and blindly assume he's still on our side.
Who's with me?
Sorry, but when all this started, you're the one who told us that Michael wasn't trustworthy.
Now you want us to trust him?
Yes, for one very specific and rock-solid reason: - What's-his-name.
- Who?
The dude, the super depressing religious guy.
The the real buzzkill whose name I can never remember.
Keeblers car.
Kyra.
Sedgwick?
Oh, I love her.
Dear friend of mine.
Not important right now.
- Kierkegaard?
- Yes, Kierkegaard.
When Michael was mocking us about trying to become better people, whose name did he use, huh?
Kierkegaard.
I think he was sending us a message to take a leap of faith, 'cause that was Kierkegaard's thing, right?
Yes, although it's probably better translated as a leap into faith.
It's so hard to be your friend.
Yep, sorry.
Michael was telling us to trust him.
I had a long talk with him the other night about the whole Derek incident.
Dude was shook, talking about ethics and all spiraling about human stuff.
I think he's on our side.
Or maybe he's a supernatural demon designed to torture people, who just got offered his dream job, and has flipped on us like a ten-stone griddle chip.
It's a large pancake.
Come on, people, you can get these from context.
Look, maybe Michael jumped back to the dark side, but I don't think so.
I think he's gonna help us escape.
I know it sounds crazy, but if it weren't crazy, they wouldn't call it a leap of faith.
They would call it a sit of doubting.
I never thought I'd be the one to say it, but this is getting out of hand.
I think we gotta go to the cops.
What cops?
Where do you think we are?
Before tonight's party, I'd love to talk more about your strategy for torturing Tahani.
I'm impressed you were able to make her fall in love with Jason.
- She must be miserable.
- Yeah.
Humans make a lot of mistakes when they're horny.
Uh, boss, give me a second here.
- What the here, dude?
- Vicky My hard work paid off for you, and now you're just taking all the credit.
Vicky, Vicky, this can work out great for both of us if we play our cards right.
Shawn thinks that this is attempt number two, right?
Now, if I tell him that you've been in charge of this version, he's eventually gonna find out that there've been hundreds of failed versions.
Oh right.
And if that happens, we're all going down.
-  - So, spread the word.
No one talks about the reboots.
Fine, but you better make this right.
Mama want promotion, ya heard?
- Hello, you dummies!
-  This neighborhood was a labor of hate for many people here, so I thought that we should celebrate with an art form that we literally invented here in the Bad Place: the comedy roast!
I see Jason Mendoza's here.
Jason might not be the smartest guy in the world, but he is the dumbest guy in the world.
-  - Oh, Jason, buddy, all you had to do was to keep quiet, but you couldn't stop talking about Kendall Jenner or that dumb quarterback what was his name?
Derek Bortles?
Always ranting about Derek Bortles.
Lucky for you, my friend, Jaguars games are the only ones televised in the Bad Place, because they suck!
No, they don't.
All we need is a defense and an offense and some rule changes.
Don't take it personally.
He just has to put on a show for the other demons.
Tahani Al-Jamil, elegance, grace, sophistication, but enough about your sister.
You know what the worst moment of Tahani's life was?
When the last song played at one of her parties, and she would run off and cry because she still hadn't won her parents' approval.
You know the other worst moment of Tahani's life?
Every other moment of her empty, pointless life!
-  - Hey-oh!
I see Eleanor Shellstrop is here.
Eleanor and I have a lot in common.
Now, here's how you can tell us apart: one of us is a manipulative demon who's an expert at making other people miserable, and then the other one is me!
You thought you deserved a Medium Place like Mindy St. Claire?
Are you kidding me?
You're bad, Eleanor.
This is exactly the place you should be.
Not super funny for a roast there, bud.
Oh, sorry, you want a joke?
Okay, you love Chidi, and Chidi doesn't love you back.
- Boom!
-  Now, that's funny, because it's very cruel and humiliating.
I consider you one of my closest friends - Not now, dude.
- "Speaking of Chidi" is something no one has ever said, because no one talks about Chidi, because no one likes Chidi, because he's so annoying about ethics.
Now, when you taught the Trolley Problem, did you secretly wish that it could be you who wound up under the trolley?
Because all your students did.
- Whoo!
-  Oh, Chidi, sorry, I got a joke for you, bud.
- Uh, knock knock.
- Who's there?
You died alone, because you couldn't commit to anyone.
You died alone because you couldn't commit to anyone who?
- No.
- Jason Mendoza!
Okay, that's all my time.
Let's tear this mother to the ground!
So, maybe I was wrong, and Michael isn't on our side.
What up, pork sticks?
That was "She Hates Me" by Puddle of Mudd.
Coming up next, "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer".
- Idiots.
-  We're going streaking!
The one time I think someone isn't lying to me, and it bites me in the ash.
I guess Michael really did flip back to the bad side.
Oh, does one think?
That roast was the meanest thing I've ever seen, and I once saw a waiter bring Russell Crowe the wrong tea.
Well, we have no choice.
We go to Shawn, and we tell him that we'll trade secret information about the reboots, if he'll go easy on us, and if that doesn't work, we try to get Janet free and head to Mindy's.
Agreed?
Yeah, Michael sucks now.
He pretended to be our friend.
He's gonna torture us for eternity.
And you know what the worst part is?
He doesn't remember the name of my favorite football player.
Definitely not the worst part.
It is to me.
Blake Bortles is a cool name.
Derek Bortles is a dumb name.
Grandma got run over by a reindeer Walking home from our house Christmas Eve Hey, man, have you told Shawn how hugely important I was yet?
I will get to it.
Promise.
Now, you just relax.
Enjoy yourself.
Rip a cat in half.
It's a party, Vicky, come on.
- Hey.
- Aah.
What does Michael keep whispering to you?
Um, something, something, Vicky, something, something.
Uh, can I braid your hair?
- No.
- Please?
No, you know what, I'm good.
I got it.
Ooh!
Hey, help me get these bracelets off Good Janet.
No, Shawn put them on her for a reason.
I'm not overruling the boss.
You're such a suck-up, Gayle.
- Can I braid your hair?
- No get this I got it Ow, get your own bracelet, Victoria.
She  hates me!
Okay, you fat dinks, the sun is up, and we're about to close it down with one last song: "She Hates Me" by Puddle of Mudd and "Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer" played at the same time.
Honestly, I'm still partial to the old-fashioned scorpion diapers, but you've done great work here.
I can't thank you enough for everything.
- Shawn, wait.
- No I have some very interesting information about who's really responsible for this neighborhood.
Shawn, the humans are escaping.
It's Michael.
Michael's responsible for this neighborhood and everything that's happening right now.
- Bye!
- I - Bad Janet?
- What's cracking, nut-butts?
Call us another train immediately.
Party's over.
How did they get Janet's bracelets off?
It's literally impossible for a human to do.
It's like breathing underwater or driving without texting.
Shawn, I don't wanna make any accusations, but I accuse Vicky.
She asked me to help her take Janet's bracelets off.
Oh, Vicky, you didn't.
She definitely did.
She's jealous.
She's been trying to sabotage me the entire time.
What?
No, he's lying.
Okay, I did try to get the bracelets off, - but I couldn't.
- Listen to yourself.
- You sound crazy.
- Normally I would love hearing a man tell a woman she's crazy, but I can't.
You aided the humans just to spite Michael.
You're not a demon.
You're a jerk.
Wait, this is trick.
Michael is the traitor.
I bet they're still here somehow.
This place stretches for 1,000 miles.
Fine.
Bad Janet?
What?
Scan the neighborhood, please.
No sign of any humans, but I actually did find something for Vicky.
What?
-  -  -  - Bad Janet, - great stuff as always.
- No duh.
- And as for Vicky - No, wait  This is a PR disaster.
We have to keep it all under wraps.
Get her on the train, and if anyone else says a single word of what happened here to anyone, you will be in a cocoon just like Vicky, and it is gooey in there.
How do we get the humans back from Mindy's?
They've bought themselves some time, but we'll get them.
I'll start the extradition papers.
You stay here.
I want every trace of this neighborhood erased.
Oh, that was a bad idea!
That was so scary so many different times.
I hated that.
You guys!
I was so scared for you.
I told you he was on our side.
You're my friends, and I want  I wanted to save you.
Hey, it's okay, bud.
This is the best summer ever, you guys.
Oh.
Oh, Michael, we never doubted you for a moment.
Thank you, Tahani.
You're lying, though, right?
Yes, I am.
I doubted you very strongly.
But then I figured it out.
Kierkegaard, baby!
Leap of faith.
It's better translated as a leap into faith.
You remembered!
Can somebody please explain what happened, and and can you guys just be a tiny bit quieter?
Because, um, I've been drunk on magnets all day, and and I can literally hear every sound in the universe.
Basically, Michael sent us a code, and we had to crack it.
I figured out the first clue - No, you didn't, I did.
- I was there, though!
- Ooh - Blake Bortles is a cool name.
Derek Bortles is a dumb name.
Yes Derek Bortles is indeed a very dumb name.
It's a clue.
There's no way Michael would've forgotten the name Blake Bortles.
You say it a million times a day.
- 'Cause he's the best.
- No, he's not, and even I know that.
Michael was telling us to use Derek, Janet's Derek, for something.
There were clues in the roast.
Everybody, quietly but quickly head to the train station, but let's split up, so we don't draw attention.
Ugh, you guys are the worst conspirators.
Okay, what else did Michael say in the roasts that might be meaningful?
Tahani, do you remember?
Well, he said my entire life was pointless and empty.
Yeah, but did he say anything we don't already know?
Anything that stood out?
You know what the worst moment of Tahani's life was?
When the last song played at one of her parties, and she would run off and cry, because she still hadn't won her parents' approval.
That was odd.
A host never runs off during their last song, because after it's over, you're supposed to act surprised when everyone drags you on stage and showers you with applause.
Maybe Michael wanted us to wait until the end of the party, when everyone was at their most distracted.
And use Derek to drive the train, because he has some of Janet's powers.
- Janet!
- Hi, hey, hey - Janet - Yeah?
We need you to go get Derek from your void.
Okay.
Shoot, where's my void again?
I forget.
Oh, yeah, it's everywhere.
Okay, hang on to your butt cheeks.
-  - Ugh, where is he?
-  - Ow, owie.
I'm never gonna find there he is.
- Derek.
- Hm.
Derek, we need you to drive this train and take us to Mindy St. Claire's house.
- Can you do that?
-  Derek.
Wait nobody get on that train.
- Derek?
- Why not?
Because of what Michael said to me.
You thought you deserved a Medium Place?
You're bad, Eleanor.
This is exactly the place you should be.
Derek Michael wants us to stay here for some reason.
Eleanor, we have a train, a conductor, and a safe destination.
I'm going to tell you the same thing I told Pippa Middleton right before we went paragliding in Gibraltar.
"Let's go".
- What?
That's what I said.
- Guys, leap of faith.
Michael said we shouldn't get on that train.
Any minute now, those demons are gonna come looking for us.
Where are we supposed to hide?
Oh, no.
Now, when you taught the Trolley Problem, did you secretly wish that it could be you who wound up under the trolley?
Because all your students did.
- All aboard!
-  The train is here.
- It's a train!
-  Get onboard?
- Actually, Derek - Derek.
You're gonna wait until the last song of the night - Derek.
- And when you do leave, you're gonna be flying a solo mission.
Oh maximum Derek.
Derek headed off, and when the new train arrived, the four of us crawled underneath before any of the drunk demons saw us.
That kept us from being detected when Bad Janet scanned the neighborhood.
We fooled those mofos like the chumps they are.
We got all four clues you left us.
Oh, that's great.
Well, I mean, I actually left you more than 1,200 clues, because of how primitive your brains are, but I'm so glad you got enough to figure it out.
Wait, how did you escape detection, though?
Well, I'm not ethically proud of this, but I framed Vicky.
It was pretty easy.
I just kept whispering things into Janet's ear to make her paranoid.
I'm sorry, wh-what did you whisper to me?
I don't remember.
Something, something, Vicky, something, something.
What does Michael keep whispering to you?
Something, something, Vicky, something, something.
- Uh - And that made her try to take Janet's bracelets off, which framed her for the escape.
- You.
- Oh Guys, I-I want to apologize for roasting you earlier.
I had to sell it, because everyone was watching.
- It was funny, though, right?
- Absolutely not.
Tahani's stuff was perfect I mean, no.
Guys, let's just take a moment here.
They're gone, which means that we won and might actually get a chance to go to the real Good Place.
This is everything we ever wanted.
Speaking of people getting what they want, I really hope Mindy liked the present we sent her.
- Who are you?
- Derek.
"Thanks for helping us all those times we showed up.
"To repay you, here's a willing sex robot and two duffel bags full of cocaine".
There are wind chimes where my ding dong should be.
- I can work with that.
- All right!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1 Okay.
I don't know about you guys, but I say we leave this miserable shirthole.
Now wait.
Wait.
Not so fast.
Now getting to the Good Place is pretty tricky.
There's no train to catch.
I have to design a complicated, unique, transportation vehicle.
- Is it Optimus Prime?
- What?
I can't believe we get to ride a real-life Optimus Prime.
I call right nipple!
That's shotgun on Optimus Prime.
Look.
This vehicle, which is decidedly not Optimus Prime - Aw!
- Has never been built before.
So I'm gonna need a few days to do this.
Dude, we just escaped by the skin of our teeth.
And any second now, Shawn is gonna realize that we are not at Mindy St. Clair's.
So whatever this magical Good Place-mobile is, now's the time to whip it out, B. I agree.
And although I believe I've asked - you this question already - There is no business class.
Michael, they're right.
We gotta go.
Oh  Okay.
Here goes nothing.
Janet, if you would.
And presto!
Oops.
Forgot to log in first.
Gotta answer my security question.
What was the name of your childhood pet?
Korzoth, the ten-headed dog-spider.
And presto!
- Dope.
- We did it, guys.
We won.
We're going to The Good Place in a fricking gold balloon.
- Shotgun!
- It's a hot air balloon.
What does that even mean?
Top of the balloon.
Ultimate shotgun.
So many memories of this place.
Eating frozen yogurt, and then having diarrhea, and then eating more frozen yogurt, and then more diarrhea.
Maybe I should've realized this wasn't the Good Place 'cause of all the diarrhea.
Maybe you shouldn't be eating all of that frozen yogurt right now.
We're about to be on a balloon, man.
What do you think our new home will be like?
I'm picturing Hawaiian beach, unlimited mai tais, and a phone.
Ugh, I miss my phone so much.
I bet I have so many texts.
I just want us all to be together.
Separate houses, obviously.
Large lawns.
I'd have a tasteful moat.
I don't care where I live, as long as they have more of this frozen yogurt.
- Why?
Why?
- An unlimited library.
All of my philosophy heroes walking around, waiting to be engaged in rigorous intellectual debate, and I hope that library is air-conditioned, because we are going to be working up quite a sweat.
Oh!
And soul mates!
I hope they're real.
I mean, you know for all of us.
I hope everyone gets someone special.
Good news!
We've got a handle on the controls.
Who's ready to go balloonin'?
Okay, I think we figured it out.
I pieced together this design from a number of ancient manuscripts, which Janet will now interpret for you.
The balloon will only transport those who have attained self-realization.
Each traveler will step upon the scale, and her soul shall be weighed.
If she's the best version of herself, it will permit her to board.
If not, passage will be denied.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
We got this.
I don't know about you guys, but I am definitely the best version of myself.
I know a shirt-ton about ethics now, 'cause I studied.
And I read books that weren't even written by the Real Housewives.
Relax, everyone.
We're all gonna be fine.
-  - Oh!
Oh, man.
I didn't believe anything I was saying.
I just whoo!
In I go.
Well, I mean -  - Oh dip!
-  - Aw, nuts!
It's okay!
The pattern is green, green, green, red.
Remember that when it starts up again.
I'm sorry, everyone.
I just have some worries as well as some concerns that could potentially turn into outright fears.
Wow, there they go.
They're fears now.
Okay, I know this mood.
Come with us, Dr. Freakout.
That was a joke.
We are actually very good friends.
Okay, here's the thing.
That balloon wants us to be the best version of ourselves.
But for the four of us, that's not just a metaphor.
There have literally been 802 different versions of us.
And how do I know that this version is the best version of myself?
How do I know it's not version #85, or 322, or 558?
Or 69, or 420?
And then you get into the whole idea of consciousness.
And I mean just forget about best.
And what version of Chidi is even real?
What happens here?
Does he eventually tire himself out?
Usually, but this one seems to be getting stronger as he goes on.
And this Chidi is an imposter!
Okay.
This is pretty simple, bud.
You've been our teacher this whole time.
And we are much better because of you.
If we're the best versions of ourselves, which that balloon just proved, then you definitely are.
So in a way, it doesn't matter if I was better in version 492 or whatever, because the best version of me is just as much about my effect on the world around me as it is about my own egocentric self-image.
I really meant that much to you guys?
Of course you did.
Now let's get you back on that scale, dorkus.
Chidi, ready to try again?
Yeah.
All right.
-  - Yeah!
Yeah!
-  - Yeah.
-  - Dope!
-  - Oh!
Chidi got in my head.
It's just that thing Chidi said about previous versions of myself.
It's screwing me up.
But I can fix it.
I stole this from your house the first night we were here.
Okay.
Should be the best version of myself now.
-  -  Come on, scale.
Be cool.
Guys, we're just not ready.
I think we should regroup and try again tomorrow.
Hang on.
I know the answer.
I know why I'm not my best self.
Do you remember that version of me from the tape of us at Mindy's?
Where I was vulnerable and emotional and honest?
That Eleanor is a better Eleanor than this one.
And that is not an easy thing for me to say, "You're not better than me" was my yearbook quote.
Michael, can you tell us a little bit about that version?
Reboot number 119.
All the restaurants were kabob places.
You had a pet lizard which I made poop on you all the time.
No, can you tell us more about Chidi's and my relationship from that version?
Right.
Sorry.
Well, you got really into ethics, and you spent a lot of time together.
Once you handed him a tissue right before he sneezed, and that simple act of anticipating his needs made him fall for you.
One night you took a walk along the lake, and you had your first kiss, which: Gross.
Kissing is gross.
You just mash your food holes together.
It's not for that.
Anyway, it just you know bloomed after that.
Look, there are obviously some undealt-with issues here.
I propose that everyone who was green go ahead and board the magic balloon, and set out to the Good Place.
Sort of like an advance team.
We'll put our names in or book a table.
However it works.
And then we'll send back the magical balloon for the red light people later on.
It's a perfect plan.
No!
It's not working!
It probably thinks I'm Eleanor.
It is I, Tahani.
In case you were wondering, I am by definition the best version of myself, because my operating system is always updating.
I'm not sure that's true, Janet.
You still haven't talked to Jason about your romantic baggage, and the three of you are in some sort of weird love triangle.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Also, love isn't a triangle.
It's a five dimensional blob, so Okay.
If you're so perfect, step on the scale.
Fine.
Ooh, I think I broke it.
No!
My beautiful balloon scale!
It's not yours.
No, no, please stop fighting.
Oh man.
This stinks.
I'm having this feeling where what is it called?
You know, where you you did a thing and you're sad after it?
After-sad?
Is that no.
You humans have so many emotions!
You only need two: Anger and confusion!
Michael, what's going on?
The problem isn't any of you.
This whole balloon thing is a fake.
The truth is, I have no idea how to get into the Good Place and I never have!
Well, Michael's right.
I'm angry and confused.
So months ago, when you said you had this whole complicated plan for getting us to the Good Place It was a lie.
I assumed if I bought myself some time, I could figure out a way in.
Guys, I tried a billion different ways.
Not an exaggeration!
I actually tried one billion and twelve different plans.
But the only way into the Good Place is by being a good person on Earth.
This is unforgivable.
How many times can you betray us?
I'm sorry.
I really am, because while I was searching for a way to get in, I was also taking your ethics classes, learning why it was bad to lie.
So not only did I fail at getting us into the Good Place, I also learned the error of my ways.
Real rock bottom for a demon, I'll tell you.
But this was not torture.
I was stalling!
So I could keep searching for a way in.
I would've been happy if you were to live in this neighborhood forever, but then Shawn came and just ruined the whole thing.
So what happens now?
Shawn will eventually figure out you're not at Mindy's, and he'll realize that someone on the inside was helping you.
So you'll go to the real Bad Place forever, and I will be be retired.
You're you're mad at me.
I'm not mad.
I'm just disappointed.
Oh, come on.
Everyone knows that's worse.
So this really is the end.
Completely out of options, are we?
Not completely out of options.
We can do what the Shellstrops have always done when the chips are down.
Ignore our problems, and drink heavily.
Janet!
A million bottles of your finest booze, please!
- You all right?
- Kind of.
I asked Michael if I could pop the giant balloon, and he said no.
Then I asked if I could suck the helium out of it to make my voice sound funny so it cheers everyone up, and he just kind of sighed and walked away.
So I guess that one is still on the table.
Are you and me cool?
Not exactly.
I think perhaps given everything, it's best we end our relationship.
It's probably about time I stopped relying on others for my sense of self-worth or happiness.
You know my whole life, whenever I encountered any obstacles, I would simply say, "I would like to speak to a manager".
But in our relationship, there was no manager.
There was no one who could fix this for me except me.
My mom was a manager at a pet store.
Does that help?
No, and please don't launch into one of your long stories - She got fired after I - Please, no.
Robbed the pet store where she worked.
- Please, please, Jason.
- We actually - robbed it together.
- No, no, no.
Long story short, it was all a dream.
Thank you, Jason, for making this moment a little easier for me.
Dude, he's where I'm at.
- Feelings are stupid.
- Yeah.
Who needs 'em?
But, uh, in case feelings aren't stupid, and in the case that we are eternally doomed, I thought it might be worth mentioning that I do Have feelings for you.
And I know you don't feel the same way.
And although that fills me with anger and confusion Wow.
Michael was right on the money.
I just wanted you to know the truth.
You are I mean Oh, no.
Don't say anything.
Don't.
I want to.
I want to.
Here's the thing about me.
You know the sound that a fork makes in the garbage disposal?
That's the sound that my brain makes all the time.
It's just this constant grinding about things I'm afraid of or things that I want or want to want or want to want to Is it grinding in there right now, bud?
Yep, but the point is the circumstances under which me met are completely insane.
And that just makes the grinding harder.
I just wish we met the way normal people meet.
Like at a philosophy conference, or after one of my philosophy lectures.
Or you came knocking on my office door asking for help with philosophy.
Is that how you think people meet?
I don't know how normal people meet.
You're such a nerd.
Attention, everyone.
We may not know exactly which version of ourselves was technically our best self, but you know what?
I like who we are right now.
To this version of us.
To the good people we've all become.
Oh, and to Eleanor, our unofficial leader.
You pack a lot of heart and grit into that diminutive frame.
Like a scrappy little auto mechanic.
That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me, babe.
And I'll take it.
- And to Janet, the best robot.
- Not a robot.
- Girl.
- Not a girl.
- And straight up hottie.
- I am attractive, yes.
Any of us could have ever asked for.
Thanks, guys.
Because of the way we were conceived of and created, Janets don't typically give speeches.
Oh, she's done.
She's not gonna give a speech.
Okay.
Cool.
Ooh!
One more toast.
To Michael!
- Michael!
- Whoo-whoo!
Hoo-hoo!
Who is easily the best version of himself.
Granted, the bar was low.
He is a demon.
But he made a mistake and admitted he was wrong, which makes him better than 90% of all humans.
And you know what, it wasn't really Michael's fault.
We weren't getting into the Good Place anyway.
I mean, look at us.
A self-obsessed socialite, a ridiculous giraffe, an absurd British aristocrat, a narcissistic attention seeker.
- Are these all me?
- Yes.
I was gonna do eight for you, and one for everyone else.
The point is Michael, we forgive you.
I mean, at least you tried to find a way to the Good Place.
And that's the greatest thing someone can do, just try your best.
So we hereby name you an honorary human.
And we would like to present you with this human starter kit.
Car keys!
So I could lose them, and say, "Has anyone seen my car keys"?
I can do that you know that thing where  Thank you!
And Band-Aids for your stupid, fragile bodies.
Oh, and look at this.
A stress ball with a dumb corporate logo.
Oh, I can't wait to keep finding this and then almost throw it away, and then think, "No, I'll use it".
Oh, guys.
A Dr. Oz diet book because you're all such suckers.
This is all garbage that I have no real use for.
That's right.
Welcome to being human, buddy.
To Michael!
Unforgettable That's what you are - You don't remember?
- No.
- Of course you don't!
- That's mean!
That was version one!
Michael, there's a message coming in from Shawn.
"Finish shutting everything down.
"Sending train first thing tomorrow.
"Humans will be captured and tortured soup.
"Sorry.
Autocorrect.
Soon.
"Although weirdly, "I did just finish turning someone into soup.
So random.
Okay.
Bye".
What do you guys think the Bad Place is going to be for you?
I'll probably go to a Skrillex concert.
And I'll be waiting for the bass drop, and it it'll never come.
For me it'll be camping.
Like, I'll just always be camping.
I'm pretty good at turning every place I go into my personal hell, so I think they'll have a lot of options for me.
Mine will obviously be an eternity spent in the Swiss Alps.
That sounds amazing.
In Autumn.
The off-season.
Yeah.
Still fine.
You'd be fine.
Who are we kidding?
You'll probably be running the place in like a week.
She'll be like, "Oh, hibbledy-dibbledy, This simply won't do.
I demand to speak to your manager".
- Again!
Again!
- "Your manager".
Of course!
That's it.
We should speak to the manager.
Wait, you said that there was a judge who decides on disputes between the Good Place and the Bad Place, right?
Some sort of head honcho I could pace in front of and plead our case to and maybe even wag a finger at disapprovingly.
I thought about that.
It's a non-starter.
Judge rarely hears cases.
And the only way to get to the Judge's office is through a portal, and we can never get to that.
Why not?
We'd have to walk through the actual Bad Place, in plain sight, without getting caught.
Reach and pass through the portal, Convince the judge to hear us out, even though we didn't go through the proper channels.
And then somehow win our unwinnable case.
Okay.
Let's do it.
You're serious?
Yeah!
What do we have to lose?
All I've ever really wanted was to know what it feels like to be human, and now we're going to do the most human thing of all: attempt something futile with a ton of unearned confidence and fail spectacularly!
Get up!
Get up!
Everyone.
Get rest tonight.
First thing tomorrow, we're going to the Bad Place.
We had a lot of good times together.
I'll see you in the next life.
Good-bye, clowns.
Goodbye, modernist architecture that I was too trashy to appreciate.
Good-bye, house.
Good-bye, house.
What up, idiot?
This is the 8:22 express to Bad Place Headquarters.
We'd like to begin the boarding process with our first-class fat dinks.
And there is no overhead storage, so if you have any bags, why don't you just go ahead and place them up your fat butts?
Sorry about this, Bad Janet.
Sorry about what, you fat dink?
This was your life's work.
Are you okay with leaving the fake Good Place behind?
As long as I'm with you guys, I'm always in the fake Good Place.
That doesn't sound as nice as you think it does.
The real Bad Place was the friends we made along the way.
Nope.
Still nonsense.
One more try.
In a way, the Good Place was inside the Bad Place all along?
You know what?
That's technically true.
- I'm gonna give it to you.
-  I just made an aphorism.
Hit it, Janet!
Next stop, the actual Bad Place!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1  You all right there, chief?
You look like you lost your lucky bookmark or something.
Oh, no.
Did I?
It's fine.
Got it right here.
It's just that now that we're actually on the train, heading to Bad Place Headquarters, this plan is starting to feel slightly completely insane.
This is the only way to get to the Judge?
I'm afraid so.
Yes.
See the Judge exists in a sort of neutral zone, separate from the Good Place and the Bad Place.
The only things there are the Judge's quarters, the accounting department, and the Janet warehouse.
There's also an IHOP.
Oh!
I'm gonna order the Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity!
No.
Sorry.
In this realm, IHOP stands for "Interdimensional Hole of Pancakes".
You don't really eat these pancakes.
It's more like they eat you.
Okay.
I'll get eggs, then.
So the only way to get to the Judge is through a portal, which is smack-dab in the middle of the main office at Bad Place Headquarters.
And the only way through the portal is with one of these.
What is that?
Is that jewelry?
Not that it matters.
It's just some jewelry I don't have.
- Can I have it?
- These pins are very hard to come by.
Only upper management types have them.
So you guys will lay low while I get us four more.
Janet doesn't need one, because for portals, she counts as a carry-on.
I'm luggage.
I had Janet make you each a Bad Place disguise.
And everyone who worked in the neighborhood has been sent back to their previous department.
So the chances of you being recognized are very small.
I don't know.
This plan seems complicated.
To be fair, you also once said that about an orange.
They don't make sense.
Apples, you eat their clothes.
But oranges you don't?
Forget this plan!
I say we just huck a Molotov cocktail and  run through the portal.
I think we should go with Michael's plan.
I'm telling you, Molotov cocktails work.
Any time I had a problem, and I threw a Molotov cocktail, boom!
Right away, I had a different problem.
He makes a strong case.
Okay, now, you're all going to need aliases.
Cool.
I'm gonna be Diana Tremaine.
That was the name on my fake ID in high school.
Her address was 123 Whatever Street, Canada City, Canada.
Arizona bouncers are the best.
Character work!
Such fun.
I actually dabbled in a bit of acting after university.
Although mostly I just stood around while Baz Luhrmann just threw glitter on me.
Ooh, I shall be Rhonda Mumps.
And I work down at the hot dog factory.
You need to be more specific.
There are nine hot dog torture departments.
Making people into, stuffing people with Ooh, stuffing people sounds fun.
Is that like shoving them into the throats of vegans?
Yes.
Throats.
I know what my secret identity is.
You cannot be Blake Bortles.
- Fine.
Then I'll be Jake - Don't say Jortles.
Jortles!
And I work in the Molotov cocktail department.
Boy, you know, I thought you guys would be more worried about this.
We've been knee-deep in demons for, like, 800 reboots now.
Lying about who we are is second nature.
Chidi?
I hate this.
I hate lying.
It's not permissible.
- I can't do this.
- Oh, boy.
Jeez Louise!
Looks like Chidi has a real case of the Mondays, am I right?
Hey, pass the NASCAR ketchup.
Hey, buddy.
Look if you don't want to lie because it conflicts with your moral principles, I get it.
No one's gonna be mad at you.
- Really?
- No, dumbass!
I'm lying to you to make you feel better.
See?
Sometimes lying is awesome.
Plus I said dumbass.
Oh, cursing.
How I've missed you.
Look, Eleanor, our goal here is to appear in front of a judge who is going to judge us.
What if I lie down here and I lose 12 points, and then we get in front of the Judge, and I'm 12 points short?
Or what if the Judge won't even take our case at all because we lied to get there?
Kant says that lying is always wrong, and I follow that maxim.
So you can't even lie to demons?
They're trying to torture us, man.
We're behind enemy lines!
Well, principles aren't principles when you pick and choose when you're going to follow them.
I won't lie about who I am.
Okay.
I understand, and I'm cool with it.
You're lying right now, aren't you?
Yes.
I want to strangle you.
What even is this thing?
I hate suits.
They remind me of court and going to court and being my own lawyer against the advice of the judge in court and getting immediately convicted in court.
I think you look nice.
I think you look sexy.
Here, I got you this to help your disguise.
Whoa, a briefcase?
Take my credit card to the hedge fund.
I'll meet you at the martini store.
Oh, you're gonna get caught.
Give me the briefcase back.
- Thanks.
- Aww.
Janet, you need to get in character too.
Now I know you look like a Bad Janet, but can you act like one?
I have gained a lot of new skills recently.
For example, I learned how to be passive-aggressive.
Totally fine that you guys haven't noticed.
- Oh!
- Let's practice.
I'm going to make a simple request, and you're going to give me that patented Bad Janet attitude.
Can I have a glass of water?
Here you go!
Nope.
Let's try again.
Be mean.
Bad Janet, can I have a glass of water?
No.
I would never give you that, you dumb person.
Janet, what's that behind your back?
- Nothing.
- Give it to me.
It's a glass of water.
And a back-up glass.
Oh, boy.
It's okay.
We'll keep working.
We're here.
All trains today are delayed by three hours, just like they are every day.
All passengers, you all suck, and you're ugly.
Keep walking.
Keep your heads down.
- And you are ugly.
- Just act unnatural.
Hey, guys.
Sorry, you wait here, while I go get us some more of these pins.
But what is this place?
It's just a place.
You know.
An area or location.
- It's pretty straightforward.
- The Museum of Human Misery?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
It's a torture museum.
Famous examples of bad behavior, and explanations of the torture they earned.
Is there a gift shop?
Jason, this is Hell.
Of course there's a gift shop.
It's the least horrifying room.
It's the Hall of Low-Grade Crappiness.
First person to floss in an open plan office?
Well, she deserves to be tortured.
She's a monster.
This was the safest place I could think of.
No one ever comes in here.
Guys, if you do leave this room, you're gonna see things that will haunt you for eternity.
Okay.
Back soon.
Bye!
Hey!
Hey!
Be careful, okay?
Be careful?
Yeah.
Oh.
Eleanor, are you worried about me?
Yeah.
I'm worried.
I mean 'cause you're our ticket out of here, genius.
Don't go getting all goopy on me.
Worry about them.
I'll be fine.
Okay.
"First man to send an unsolicited picture of his genitals".
"First waiter to approach a diner with an empty plate and sarcastically say, 'I guess you hated it.
'" "First white person to grow dreadlocks".
And "First person to call Ultimate Frisbee 'Ultimate.
'" This dude rules!
All right, everyone.
We've got a lot of work to do.
Why don't you set up the bar over by that wall?
Why don't you roll off your mom and do it yourself, you fat dink?
Set up more of those tables.
We're expecting a big crowd.
You got it, you piece of butt.
Son of a bitch!
Still happy I can swear now, but everything else about this is very bad!
Hey, boss.
I'm back.
Welcome home.
Axe up.
Oh!
New scent!
"Transformers"!
Yes.
It makes you smell the way "Transformers" movies make you feel.
Still can't believe those jagoffs got away from us.
- Really zips my tip.
- Yeah.
Anyway I drew up some extradition papers to get them back from Mindy's.
I think I'll take a few of my most trusted staff, hop in the portal, file those with the Judge, quick stop for pancakes, and then I'll head on back.
By the way, I'm gonna need four pins for my crew.
This is very thorough.
However Is that where we're putting top priority files nowadays?
We won't need extradition papers.
Plans are already in motion to get the humans back in a different way.
Ah.
Oh, man.
This is not good.
This is not good!
All right.
Well, we can't just stand here in a group.
It looks too conspicuous.
I'll go with Tahani.
Chidi, go with Jason.
That way, Jason's unearned confidence lets him do all the talking, and you don't have to lie.
Okay?
Come on, Diana, let's hit the bar.
I'm gonna get me a tall glass of piping hot corn syrup and a scooter, so I can roll around the mall.
- That's really good.
- Thank you.
Hors d'oeuvre?
Oh, what do you got?
Soul food from Maine, bagels from Arkansas, Hawaiian pizza of course, and egg salad from a hospital vending machine in Azerbaijan.
Have a terrible evening.
No way!
Trent, is that you?
Who else could it be?
Come on, dab it out.
Boom boom!
'Sup?
I'm Chet.
Jake is my name, Molotov cocktail is my game.
I think school is lame, I got a tattoo of David Blaine.
- What?
- Ooh!
Tight!
Ball tap!
Oh, dude.
Ball tap!
Oh!
That was a firm ball tap, bro.
Anyway, your boy Trent and I worked together in partial decapitations.
When'd you leave decap?
800 years ago?
Something like that.
I just joined a new department.
Toxic Masculinity.
We torture internet trolls, frat dudes.
Actually started as a training program to prep for when the "Girls Gone Wild" dude gets here.
- Joe Francis.
- The one.
Legend!
Bro-hams!
Get over here and meet my top dog Trent.
Dude's a straight beast when it comes to torture.
- 'Sup, bro?
- It's actually pretty choice that we're running into you right now.
My top dog Dirk here, he got stuck with a new case.
He can't crack it.
Hit them with it, D-Money.
So I'm trying to torture this guy, right?
Brant?
Brant was a total lord.
He got kicked off of Rob Gronkowski's party cruise for throwing a lobster at a stripper.
And then he died doing a keg stand in the back of a moving Jeep Wrangler.
Anyways, we run a couple hundred torture scenarios.
None of them seem quite right, you know?
Think we can get you to crack this nut?
Well, I mean, how could I say no?
We all know how I would say no.
You know I'd be all like, "No"!
- But you know I can't.
- So weird, Trent, man.
You're always so weird.
Love that about you.
Don't get me wrong, I love shoving hot dogs into people, but once you've dogged every hole, you just start to feel like you're repeating yourself.
I hear that, sister.
I'm gonna go take a dump.
- You want me to grab you one?
- No, I'm good.
Thanks.
- Not even a little nug?
- Nah, I'm a'ight.
A'ight.
Damn, you're good at this.
Well, hang out with Johnny Depp long enough, and you become pretty good at lying.
Like, "No, you're whole thing isn't exhausting at all".
Hi there, you big stinky poop face guys.
Ugh.
It's me, Good Janet.
I'm sorry I called you big stinky poop face guys.
That's okay.
Janet, can you dig around a little bit and find out what this event is and how long it's gonna last?
I'd love to punch your teeth.
Hey.
Hi.
Teeth.
What's all this?
Well, I was going to try to get the humans back by going through the proper channels, but then I remembered, I'm a naughty bitch.
So I sent a black ops team to Mindy's to extract them.
Nobody from the Bad Place is allowed in Mindy's neighborhood.
You can't do that, Shawn.
It's illegal!
Oh, no.
Guys, Michael says this is illegal.
I hadn't thought of that.
That was sarcasm.
I had thought of that.
Listen.
Your experiment blew up in our faces.
The example I made out of Vicky ensured that everybody from the neighborhood has kept their mouths shut.
But we're not out of the woods until those four are back in custody.
So I rounded up some loyal friends and took matters into my own hands.
Relax, Mike.
This will all be over soon, and we can all head down to the Museum.
- The Museum?
- Yes.
Your neighborhood Our neighborhood is being immortalized for its success.
It's all going to work out.
I took the form of a 45-year-old white man for a reason.
I can only fail up.
The team is in place.
Let's do this.
Hey.
Hi.
So, um, those bro demons over there think I'm some kind of great torturer.
And they want my advice on how to torture someone.
Jason is stalling by ranking MMA ring girls with them, but I have to do something.
Eleanor, you're wearing glasses now.
Help me!
You know the answer, dude.
Lie your ass off.
If Rhonda can do it, you can.
You know once I shoved a hot dog right down the throat of the legendary John Wayne.
She even name drops in Hell.
No!
I told you lies have consequences!
I will have contributed to someone's eternal torture because I disobeyed a basic Kantian moral principle!
I'm gonna be sick, and I don't want to go back to the bathroom because they put mirrors in the toilet, and that makes you really confront what you're doing!
Okay.
Okay.
Sit down.
Take a breath.
Rub your lucky bookmark.
Hear me out.
What if lying is ethical in this situation?
What if certain actions aren't universally good or bad?
- Like Jonathan Dancy says.
- Jonathan Dancy?
Are you talking about moral particularism?
We never even covered that.
You read on your own?
You think just because I'm a straight hottie I can't read philosophy for fun?
Look.
Moral particularism says there are no fixed rules that work in every situation.
Like, let's say you promised your friend you'd go to the movies.
But then your mom suddenly gets rushed to the ER.
Your boy Kant would say never break a promise.
Go see "Chronicles of Riddick".
Doesn't matter if your mom gets lonely and steals a bucket of Vicodin from the nurse's closet.
- Real example?
- Yep!
But a moral particularist like me I'm one now; I just decided would say there's no absolute rule.
You have to choose your actions based on the particular situation and right now, we are in a pretty bonkers situation.
I don't think I can change what I believe just like that!
And I didn't think I would ever be at a cocktail party in literal Hell, lecturing my teacher/ex-lover about moral particularism, but life throws you curveballs, bro!
And need I remind you it was doing things your way that made you end up here.
Man, get back over there, dog.
Damn, you got that good stank.
Thanks.
Right back at you, bud.
Smash you later.
Let's roll.
Hey, butt ass.
Butt ass.
How long is this stupid event supposed to last, anyway?
They're unveiling the exhibit in ten minutes, then everyone will get drunk and poke each other with hot sticks, and then it'll be over.
Farts.
Uh-oh.
Bad Janet, walkie-talkie mode.
Now entering Mindy St. Claire's house.
This is so exciting!
I hope everyone gets hurt!
Living room's clear.
Entering the bedroom.
- Oh, yeah!
- Ow.
Oh, God!
This feels so weird!
Here we go!
Oh, do some coke off my butt.
Wait!
What whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who are you guys?
Oh, friends!
Hi, I'm Derek!
Where are the humans?
And who is Derek?
Me is Derek.
These are my wind chimes.
-  - Uh-oh!
My wind chimes like you.
The only people here are Mindy St. Claire and an unknown male with a genital deformity.
The four humans are not here.
Where is Michael?
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
- Hey there, Mike!
- Hey, Lance.
Looking good, buddy.
You lose some weight?
I wish.
Listen up, people.
We need to find Michael, and we need to be discreet.
You, search from the spastic dentistry department down through disembowelment.
You, cover children's dance recitals through holiday weekend IKEA.
Go.
Hey, hey!
Found him!
Just bird-dogging some tail.
What you got for me, Trent?
Well, peep this, dog.
You really want to torture this dirtbag?
You give him books.
I'm serious.
This one time I was assigned this a chick that I had to torture, and I just couldn't figure it out.
And then I realized she hated books, so I just gave her mad books to read, round the clock.
Books like exploded?
No, no, no.
They were just you know regular moral philosophy books.
You know everyone hates moral philosophers.
That is true.
And I know it's wild, but you know sometimes you gotta think outside the bun.
- Ah!
Sick Taco Bell ref.
- Very nice.
But I don't know, man.
Sounds kind of lame.
This guy's the best, really?
Yeah, maybe I don't know what I'm talking ball tap!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Ohh!
That's what you get for questioning Trent, the torture master!
He got you so bad!
Yeah, he did.
He did.
Nice job, bro.
All right, you've convinced me.
I'll give him books.
Hey, you two.
Get your ugly necks over here.
Guys, I found something very bad.
We have to get out of here right now.
All right, everybody.
Gather 'round.
Gather 'round.
This is the moment we've all been waiting for.
- What do we do?
- Just don't draw attention.
Whatever this is, it'll be over in a second, and we can sneak out the door.
Feast your eyes on the newest exhibit here at the Museum of Human Misery!
The residents of neighborhood 12358W!
Oh no!
Is that what they think my hair looks like?
This game-changing experiment chose four humans and had them torture each other.
It's already led to major breakthroughs in the future of our industry.
Now, obviously, we couldn't get the actual four idiots as they're off being tortured, so we cooked up the next best thing.
- Want to meet them?
-  Yes!
I'm Tahani Al-Jamil, a vainglorious attention seeker with enough jealousy to power Elon Musk's underwater mansion, which I've been to, by the way.
I have, actually.
It's remarkable.
It's remarkable!
I'm Chidi Anagonye, or maybe I'm not.
I can't decide anything.
Or maybe I can.
Aww.
I can't decide.
My stomach hurts.
What?
They kind of nailed it.
I've heard you say all that stuff.
I'm Eleanor Shellstrop.
I mock others to distract myself from the emptiness inside me.
That's fair.
That's a fair hit.
I'm Jason Mendoza.
Duh That's me.
Hey.
Where have you been?
Oh, how do you smell loud and confusing?
No time to explain.
We gotta go.
I got the travel pins!
Yo!
That looks like my boy Trent!
And isn't that Rhonda Mumps?
- Come on!
- There he is.
And he's got the humans with him.
All right, let's just back up here.
- What do we do?
- This!
Jortles!
Go!
Hey, Eleanor.
Thanks for the advice.
It was really helpful, even though I had to say a lot of words I don't like, like douche, and chick, and peep this Okay, great!
No problem, I'm just kind of focused - on running right now.
- Right, sorry!
Here.
Put the pins on your lapels.
Okay, okay.
You didn't give me a pin, man.
I don't have one!
- Okay.
Okay.
Hang on.
Hang on!
- Wait.
Where's Janet?
No time to wait for her.
You three go now.
Now!
- Portals!
-  - Any day now, man.
- Hey!
Hey, guess what?
I just solved the trolley problem.
Remember?
The thought experiment where you're driving the trolley, and you can either plow into a group of people or turn and hit one person?
I solved it.
That's really great.
But I don't think now's the time.
See, the trolley problem forces you to choose between two versions of letting other people die.
And the actual solution is very simple.
- Sacrifice yourself.
- What does that mean?
You look after the others.
- They need you.
- No.
Step away from the portal!
- Good-bye, Eleanor.
- No, no.
Wait, wait!
Hey, boss.
What's up?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
1    That was Awesome!
- I'm going again!
- No.
I think I barfed in another dimension before we landed.
Is my barf just gonna float out there forever?
Is someone gonna fly through my barf when they use the portal?
Ugh, stop saying barf.
And where's Michael?
He's not coming.
He sacrificed himself to save me.
The last thing I saw was Shawn grabbing him.
Was it a nice grab or a bad grab?
A bad grab.
Like, a nice bad grab, or a mean bad grab?
No Michael and no Janet.
Didn't even get to say a proper goodbye.
Not even a mere toodleloo.
We're on our own.
We have to handle this ourselves.
Michael said the portal would lead us to the Judge, so where's the Judge?
All I see is a burrito.
Do you think it's a test?
Like, maybe one of us is supposed to eat it, or we eat it together, or or maybe, maybe it's a test to see how long we can go without eating it.
I'm not scared of any burrito.
I'll eat it.
Unless The burrito is the Judge.
Don't be so bloody ridiculous.
Judges aren't food, judges are serious people who wear long, silk nightgowns and big, white powdered wigs.
Eh.
He could be right.
- What?
- Really?
I don't know, I'm just saying we've certainly seen weirder things than an all-knowing burrito.
We can't take any chances.
Hello, Your Excellency.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
We doth seek thine judgment.
We've traveled a long distance to see you, o great one.
What are you guys looking at?
Hi.
I'm the Judge.
That's a burrito.
What's up, guys?
Yeah, I did not think I had a case today.
The paperwork should've shown up by now.
Unless you guys just, like, came here.
Wait, did you guys just come here?
Oh, my God.
You guys are bad.
Which one is the worst one of you?
Is it you, glasses?
Oh, I bet it's you.
Okay, yeah, well, we did just sort of "show up," but we had to.
We were escaping the Bad Place, which now that I think about it, there might be some demons following us.
Oh, don't worry about that.
Anytime anyone shows up in my chambers, the portal is sealed until I issue my ruling.
So, you guys can relax.
Get comfortable.
A classic Saint Crispin's Day garden party frock.
Wait, is it after 4:00 p.m.?
- Not important.
- Let's have a look at your files.
Wait, you don't already know everything about us?
You're not omniscient?
Well Not in the way you mean.
I try to learn as little as I can about the events of humankind so I can remain impartial, 'cause I'm a judge.
Yadda, yadda, yadda.
That being said, sometimes I get bored and I cheat a little bit.
I've been binging Ken Burns's "Vietnam" recently.
It's okay.
I mean, I'm immortal, but that thing is long.
You know what I'm saying.
Anyway, your petition is denied.
I can't hear your case.
Please exit to the rear.
What?
I just absorbed the entirety of your existences, and I just wanna say you guys are so cute.
And the thing is, you didn't file any paperwork, and you have no advocate, and the rules say I gotta  Send you back.
Your honor, please hear our case.
You frankly wouldn't believe what we've been through just to be here today.
I mean, I would, because I just learned everything about you, but keep talking.
I am, like, obsessed with your accent.
We have made so much progress and all we ask is an audience with you to prove it.
Is that not your very purpose to weigh in on matters such as ours?
To paraphrase a song written by my godfather hey, judge.
Don't make it bad.
Take a sad group and make us better.
Say aluminum.
- Al-you-minnium.
-  I love that!
And I love your passion.
I mean, it takes a lot of guts to just show up here unannounced.
Plus, I haven't had a case in, like, 30 years and I'm super bored.
So, it's either this or start "Bloodline," and I don't know, I just don't feel like I can see Kyle Chandler as anyone else but Coach Taylor.
So, the case?
Right.
Let's do it.
You had one job torture four bad people forever.
Not only did you fail, you're a traitor.
You really junked your jeans on this one, you butterface.
I did what I had to do.
Oh, you had to junk your jeans?
How could you betray your own kind like this?
Who taught you how to turn a human inside out by reaching down their throat and grabbing their butt from the inside?
You did.
You got that right, sister.
And this is how you repay me.
Oh, spare me the sanctimonious lecture.
You never cared about me.
In the words of one of my actual friends Ya basic.
It's a human insult.
It's devastating.
You're devastated right now.
The point is, the four of them are in front of the Judge, and the Good Janet has escaped too.
You'll never find her.
Oh, you mean this Good Janet?
I found her in, like, two seconds.
She was wandering the halls being polite to people, like a chump.
So, I marble-ized her.
Keep her if you want.
Maybe shove it up your wiener for safekeeping?
I don't know, it's up to you.
I'm going to give each of you a test to see how much progress you've made.
And if I deem you fit to be in the Good Place, then zrrrup.
Up you go.
Well, actually, sort of that way.
- Mrrup.
- Great.
Can we be tested together as a group?
Yeah, we all need to be able to cheat off Chidi.
Oh, that's why your name is Chidi.
I get it now.
I'm sorry, cuties, the tests have to be individual.
Well, can we be graded as a group then?
The only reason we've come this far is because we've helped each other.
And I don't think anything's gonna feel like the Good Place if we're not together.
So, if you all pass, you're in.
And if even one of you fails, you're all effed, right?
Terrible idea.
I mean, truly awful.
You are very lucky that I cannot send you to the Bad Idea place, because that one is a stanker.
But whatever blows your dress up, am I right?
- Jason.
- Present!
Good.
In front of you is a video game system loaded with Madden football.
Are you kidding me?
I'm the best at Madden.
I call Jaguars.
As I was about to tell you, you can only play against the Jaguars.
- No.
- Using their archrivals, - the Tennessee Titans.
- No!
If you play the game and you lose Oh.
I'm gonna win.
Say no more, scary judge lady.
Tell my friends their souls are in good hands.
No, I fumbled the kickoff!
Titans suck.
Tahani it's such a pretty name.
My name is super boring Jen.
It's just short for hydrogen, which was the only thing that was in existence at the time that I was born.
Anywho.
All you have to do is go through there, walk down the hallway, and through the red door at the end.
That's it?
That's my test?
Yep.
Oh, also everyone in every room that you pass is going to be discussing what they truly think about you.
Okay, have fun.
I see.
It's a test of my ability to not care what people think of me.
Oh, no.
So, just to be clear, you actually rebooted them over 800 times, and all of these reports of their torture are completely fake?
Yes, but frankly, this is on you.
A lot of those details I just took directly from Stephen King novels and episodes of "Pretty Little Liars".
Just tell me why, why would you do this?
It's not like I planned it.
I was just trying to prove that humans could be made to torture each other.
Instead, they helped each other and got better.
They were bad people.
This is not supposed to be possible, so the only explanation is that somehow, there was a mistake made and these people belong in the Good Place.
No they don't, idiot.
Shawn, this is not fair.
Pft, fair is the stupidest word humans ever invented, except for  Staycation, ew.
Look, those four humans are good people and they deserve a staycation in the Good Place, and I bet the Judge will feel the same way.
I doubt she even hears their case.
But if she does, one of them will screw it up.
- They always do.
- I'm sick of smelling this guy's lumpy white ass.
Can we get rid of him already?
Yep.
It's time.
Follow me.
Okay.
Eleanor and Chidi.
Looks like you guys are up.
At the same time?
Yep.
Trippy, right?
There is no test.
You guys are in!
We're in?
What does that mean?
You guys have made great strides and you made it to the Good Place.
- Congrats.
-  Take these medallions and go right through that portal, and you're there in a jiff.
- We made it.
- We made it.
- We made it.
- Holy crap!
All those ethics lessons paid off.
Whoever said philosophy was stupid?
- You did, many times.
-  - As recently as this morning.
- Whoo!
But-but you also worked really hard and you deserve this.
- You really do.
-  Here's the thing, though.
It's just the two of you.
Tahani and Jason didn't make it.
I'm giving them tests right now to determine where they belong within the Bad Place, so you might wanna reconsider that judges-together thing 'cause if you stick to that, you're all going down.
I am so hungry.
Why am I so hungry?
Oh, my I'm such an idiot.
I forgot to eat my burrito.
And I was so hungry, too.
What a dork.
Okay, obviously, this is the test, right?
I bet the Judge gave Jason and Tahani the same offer, and whichever couple takes it, actually loses and the other two get in for real.
Oh!
Diabolical.
Hey, Judge.
- We figured out what you're really - Nope.
Tahani and Jason have not been given the same offer.
Here, take a look.
Tahani's test is to walk down the hallway and not get tempted by her gossiping friends.
Jason is playing video games.
Oh.
Okay, cool.
Sorry, I feel weird saying this to an almighty judge, but you have hot sauce on your chin.
Thank you.
It's actually not hot sauce.
It's envy.
Or, the concept of envy.
It's really good on Mexican food, it gives it a little kick.
Okay, so what do we do?
Oh no, that was your moral quandary grimace, which is different from your gas pain grimace.
And different from your someone said "from whence it came" instead of "whence it came" grimace.
-  - So, spit it out, man.
Well, if this isn't a test, then it's something way worse.
- What?
- A choice that we have to make.
Yeah, you know, why can't one part of the calculation of our eternal fate be easy?
I don't know.
QuvenzhanÃ© Wallis and Stephen Hawking in the same room discussing me?
Guess they must've made up.
Focus.
There'll be Fergies a-plenty in the Good Place.
I don't know where we went wrong with Tahani.
I know, she is such a disappointment compared to her sister.
Hello, Father.
Hello, Mother.
Oh, hello, Tahani.
We were just talking about how you're a huge disappointment compared to your sister.
Have a seat, we'd love to get your take.
How's it going in here?
I'm losing by three.
Meditating to calm myself down.
I'd be winning by, like, a million if I could play as the Jags instead of playing against the Jags.
I hate scoring against my own favorite team.
But you already knew that.
Because this is the test!
Yeah, that's not a revelation or something.
I explained that very clearly.
It's nice to see you, Tahani.
Apparently, wherever you've been, they've been keeping you well-fed.
You know, I've actually risked quite a lot to be in this room right now, so if you could just not be cruel for maybe 30 seconds, that would be lovely.
Apologies, it's been a while since we've seen you.
We have so much to tell you about your sister.
We've just heard the most wonderful news.
Kamilah dedicated her last album to you.
Really?
Well, she dedicated it to her fans and you're one of her fans.
The whole point of this afterlife test is that everyone in these rooms is supposed to be talking about me.
And yet, even in this scenario, you are still talking about Kamilah.
Which is exactly the point.
I was never going to be enough for you.
Never going to earn your respect.
You know, I've done things that you would never have approved of.
I died, dressed as someone in the service industry, I shagged a Floridian, I even ate a Cheeto.
-   - That's right.
Chewing it was deafening.
And it's the happiest I have ever been.
Don't get upset, dear.
You barely fit in that dress, and I'm afraid you're going to hulk out, as it were.
Okay.
I'm sorry we didn't have a better relationship.
And I wish you both the best.
All right, idiot, any last words?
Go ahead and retire me already.
Oh, you're not getting retired, Michael.
- I'm not?
- No, retirement is a spectacle.
Everyone would see the flaming ladles go down your throat.
Everyone would hear your eternal shrieks of agony, blah, blah, blah, then they'd ask me what you did.
I don't need that kind of scrutiny right now.
-  - So, I'm just gonna throw you in this unmarked room - for the rest of eternity.
-  And since it seems you love humans so much, I'll torture you like one.
All you'll have for entertainment is that giant stack of "New Yorker" magazines.
Oh, come on.
You and I both know I'll never read those.
Of course you won't.
But they'll just keep coming.
Goodbye, Michael.
We will leave you with one of Bad Janet's classic farts.
The smell will linger for 10 million years.
All right, here comes the boom!
Oh wait, actually, before I absolutely let it rip, I just have one more thing I have to do.
What?
It's me, Good Janet.
Janet.
I thought you were a marble.
That was a trick.
I realized if we wanted our friends to have any chance of survival, I had to learn how to do a lot of bad things really quickly.
So, I did.
Now I'm ready to go back to being nice again.
What happened?
Okay, now I'll be nice again.
Could you please stop doing that?
It helps me think.
We've been through every argument.
Contractualist, Kantian, what would Superman do, what would Rihanna do are we missing anything?
Hit me right now with your most obscure, boring-est, old white dude with a long wizard beard mumbo-jumbo.
Okay, our friends are going to the Bad Place, and us choosing to go with them won't lessen their suffering.
So, morally, we're allowed to go.
But let's forget about the ethics for a second.
After everything that's happened, don't we deserve to be together and happy for once?
Judge?
Have you made your decision?
Yeah.
We're not going to the Good Place.
I mean, that was never actually an option, but for the sake of your test, we're not going.
What do you mean?
Well, I was 99% sure that going was the wrong move, but since our whole relationship has been me being sure of something and Chidi explaining why I was wrong, I owed it to him to quadruple check.
The capper came when I realized that ain't Chidi.
The Chidi I know wouldn't argue that he should be rewarded while his friends got punished, and he would never "forget about ethics for a second".
I don't know who this joker is, but it's not Chidi Anagonye.
Wait, but what about the  Well done, Eleanor.
You can take a seat and wait for the others.
And can I have that medallion back 'cause it's actually a coaster for my sodas?
Mm-hmm.
Where is the real Chidi, though?
Is he okay?
He's still taking his test.
Okay, this is ridiculous.
Um I'm just gonna choose Brown.
Gray's the obvious choice, which is probably why I shouldn't choose it.
Brown.
Nope.
Gray.
Nope.
Brown.
Brown hat.
All right, fun stuff.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Feeling good?
- Very.
- I think so, yes.
Great.
You're all going to the Bad Place.
Okay, um, if I was the one who failed, could you at least tell me why I failed, for my own edification?
It took you 82 minutes to choose a hat.
But did I at least choose the right one?
There is no right one.
They're hats.
Come on, man.
Ugh.
Tahani, you skipped a lot of rooms that I thought would entice you, but you weren't supposed to open any doors, and you couldn't resist confronting your parents.
Sorry, everyone.
But now that I failed, can I go back in and talk to Winston Churchill and Freddie Mercury?
No.
Jason, your test was about impulse control, and you showed great improvements, but you never asked if you could opt not to play.
I mean, you basically told me, an all-knowing judge, to just shut up and go away.
Do you realize how insane that is?
Not as insane as picking off the greatest quarterback of all time, Black Bortles, to set up a last second game-winning field goal.
Now, Eleanor's test was about her selfishness, - and she actually - I failed.
I shoved an old lady down the stairs to get to the raw bar, 'cause I'm a shrimp fiend.
So, we all failed, let's not dwell on it.
All right, shall we?
Oh, I am gonna miss you guys.
I made a little video of our time together.
Oh, look, there we are.
You know, I thought I'd have a stomachache right now, but weirdly And everything I would I do.
There's my guy.
- What?
- Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna miss you, bud.
Every time they pull my eyeballs out through my mouth, I'll think of you.
I'm gonna frame that one.
-  - We gave it our best shot, guys.
I say we go through the portal, get a good night's sleep, come back fresh in the morning.
Try again.
Oh, Jason.
I feel like you always understand about 20% of what's happening.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
I mean, look at us.
Good times.
All right, off to eternal damnation.
Do you hear something?
Hey!
Oh!
-  - Hey, guys.
How you been?
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1 So, Michael, you're saying there's a new angle I should consider in this case?
Love that.
Major drama.
Spill the tea, sweetheart.
The premise of our system is that a person's score during her time on Earth is final and inarguable, but because of my accidental experiment, these four humans got better after they died.
That's not supposed to be possible.
Over and over again, I watched as they became thoughtful and generous and caring.
And think about where they started.
Uh, Jason, growing up in Jacksonville, what did you do for fun after school every day?
Me and my friends whipped empty spray paint cans at flamingos.
And now he's so much better.
I was already pretty good.
When I was six, I hit one right on the button.
Okay, let the immortal beings talk, darling.
So they got better in your little pretend world.
That doesn't prove anything about what they were like on Earth.
No, see, I think it does prove something.
If I'm right, the system by which we judge humans the very method we use to deem them good or bad is so fundamentally flawed and unreasonable that hundreds of millions of people have been wrongly condemned to an eternity of torture.
Damn!
That was intense!
Look at my arm, y'all.
Look, I got goosebumps.
Huh, yeah.
Doesn't happen very often.
Wow, so you saw your parents in the test?
Yes.
And I immediately fell right back into my old pattern, desperately trying to impress them and earn their admiration.
Then I heard this little voice in my head saying, "Tahani, don't do this".
The little voice in your head sounds like the old lady from "Downton Abbey".
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Maggie Smith is my godmother.
Anyway, I took a deep breath, told them I ate a Cheeto, and walked away.
Man.
You have made so much progress.
I'm proud of you, hot stuff.
Whatever progress I have made, it's because you and I have become mates.
That's British for "friends".
No, I know.
-  - Man.
Think about everything that's happened to us.
We died, Michael tortured us, we teamed up with him, we escaped, we went through the Portal, The Judge ruled against us, then Michael showed up.
This has been one of the craziest years of my life.
One of?
Yeah, I'm not sure what I would do if one more insane thing happened.
Hi, Jason.
I love you.
Oh, word?
Word.
I've been avoiding telling you.
My excuse was that I needed time to evaluate my complex feelings, but that was just a rationalization.
This might be the last time I ever get to talk to you, so there it is I love you.
And I hereby stop avoiding this topic and rationalizing by saying the situation is complicated.
Or that my brain is grinding like a fork in a garbage disposal.
All right.
Whatever.
You're not really a part of this, Chidi.
Hey, guess what.
I think I love you too, girl.
I'm not a girl.
I'm also not just a Janet anymore.
I don't know what I am.
Hey, man.
What's up?
Hot diggity dog.
Oh, no!
Now the thing I said right after we kissed will always be "hot diggity dog".
-  - Whatever.
It was an honest reaction.
I stand by it.
Hi, guys.
Couple quick announcements.
Would anyone eat chips and guac if I put it out?
It's good.
It's homemade.
No takers?
A'ight.
Second thing: we figured out a plan to save your souls.
For the time being, The Judge is gonna put you in your own medium places, like Mindi St. Clair.
And while you're there, I'll keep working every angle I can think of to get you guys into the Good Place, for real.
This is great.
So we'd all be together?
Oh, no, that's the thing about Medium Places it has to be tailored to what's medium for the individuals.
So if you're all together, it ain't medium.
How much time will we be alone?
Hard to say.
Uh, could be a month.
Could be a million years.
So, between a month and a million years.
- Yeah, give or take.
- Yeah?
Somewhere in there.
Come on, you guys, I know this isn't perfect, but I need more time to build my case, and it's either this or back to the Bad Place.
Yeah.
I'll say it.
Both those options suck.
Okay, I'm sorry if that's blunt, Your Honor, but it's true.
Also, Chidi just laid one on me, so I'm kinda dizzy.
You two kissed?
Hot diggity dog!
That's what I said!
The point is, we've all gotten better.
Why should we have to go live alone in a boring void because of a messed-up system?
- How is that justice?
- Okay.
Slow your roll there, Erin Brockovich.
First of all, y'all didn't get good enough to pass the tests I just gave you.
Second, I still believe that the only reason that you improved in Michael's fake neighborhood is because you thought there was a reward at the end of the rainbow.
You're supposed to good things because you're good!
Not because you're seeking moral desert.
And I still believe that they would've become good people if they'd just gotten a  A push in the right direction.
Oh, no.
Nope, nope.
Absolutely not.
- It's a little crazy - A little bit crazy?
It's Looney Tunes.
- What are they talking about?
- No idea.
It sets a very dangerous precedent.
It's only four people.
And it's clearly the best way to see if bad people can become good without knowing anything about what's waiting for them in the afterlife.
Shotgun.
Whatever they're talking about, if there's a shotgun, I call shotgun.
It's never gonna work, man.
If it doesn't, then they go right back to the Bad Place.
-  - No one gets hurt.
Except them, forever.
And me, I assume, also.
Forever.
Mmm, mmm, mmm - okay, let's do it.
- Yes!
Ha!
I don't know why.
I'm just feeling kinda funky.
But there have to be strict rules.
Otherwise, the results will be tainted, and I reserve the right to change my mind - at any point.
- About what?
!
Would someone who's not an eternal being please explain to me what the f  Why are you like this?
Excuse me?
Why am I like this?
You don't know me, dude.
You don't know what I'm like.
Look what you made me do, jagoff.
Look out!
Uh-oh.
Holy crap.
I just almost died.
She needs to know what was said.
God, Eleanor, take longer next time.
Oh, you look like crap.
I was outside the supermarket arguing with that little environmental twerp - Ugh, I hate that guy.
- Really?
That skinny little hippy body kinda turns me on.
- Gross.
- Guys, listen.
I dropped the margarita mix, and when I went to pick it up, a bunch of shopping carts came right at me, and I was just frozen.
And then someone pushed me out of the way, and the carts got, like, demolished by a truck.
I mean, I could've died.
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.
That's crazy.
So is the margarita mix, like, gone?
I had a near death experience recently.
You know that old warehouse that burned down last month and, like, four people died?
That building is, like, right by my old dentist.
If I still went to that dentist and I had an appointment that day, I would've been like right near there.
I was in Syracuse, New York, like two weeks before 9/11.
- No way!
- Yeah, 14 days.
I can't believe we all almost died.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop, and I think I might be a monster.
I'm rude, I'm selfish, I cyberbullied Ryan Lochte until he quit Instagram, but something happened to me today, and from now on, I'm gonna try to become a better, kinder, more generous person.
Hey, can I use your credit card?
You know what?
Yes, you can.
Cool.
It's for porn.
I already used it.
Hey.
You look happy.
You get laid last night?
I didn't.
Tried.
Hard.
This chick that I met after I followed her into a yoga class, but she wasn't into it.
Maced me.
Right in the eyes.
Stung like hell.
What was I saying?
Oh, yeah.
Hey.
Listen, dude.
What you're doing here selling fake medicine to people, tricking them is wrong.
Yeah.
And?
I can't be a part of it anymore.
I'm trying to become a better person, and as long as I work here Yeah, sure, fine, whatever, you quit, who cares?
Give me your company ID.
Thank you.
And your parking pass.
- And your panties, please.
- Dude.
What?
Come on.
I had to try.
By the way, technically, that is not sexual harassment, because she doesn't work here anymore.
You're wearing a wire?
Yeah.
Company's being investigated for fraud, so I'm helping the feds bring everyone down.
Good timing on your part.
Dude, get help.
I'm becoming a better person.
You should, too.
Hey, Eleanor, do you want to come to Lauren's baby shower?
Do you want to chew on my ass sortment of brownies that I will be bringing to Lauren's baby shower?
S-sure.
Hi there, do you have a second to talk about the environment?
Hey.
Remember me?
Ah!
Don't hurt me.
My bones are brittle.
I have a calcium deficiency.
No, I'm not gonna hurt you, man.
I came to apologize.
There.
I did it.
I apologized.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did, assface.
Nope.
You're right.
I didn't.
I apologize for being mean to you like a thousand times.
There's really no excuse.
Thanks.
Apology accepted.
Uh, what's happening?
I'm scared.
Hey, I'm on kinda like a self-improvement kick.
Do you think you could help me out, teach me to get all horny for the environment or whatever?
Hey, everyone.
This is Eleanor.
She's joining the team.
Hi, welcome.
Nice to meet you.
Hi.
All right, Eleanor.
There is a sign Among the remnants Of all our words Best left unsaid And when the truth Flies in our direction Do we work it through Or lose our heads  Maybe, maybe, maybe we're strong Maybe, maybe, maybe we're wrong Mm, babes, get in on these nachos.
- They're delish.
- Mmm, mm-hmm.
I'm actually trying to eat vegetarian.
Ew!
Why?
Is it because you feel bad for all the widdle animals with their cute widdle faces because people stuff them into tiny cages just so that we can eat them?
Yeah.
That's exactly why.
Okay, guys, um, can I say something for a second?
- I love you.
- Aww.
I do.
I mean, I went through a really rough time last year with the whole Dress Bitch thing and people selling T-shirts with my face on them, but you two stuck by me.
- I love you, you dumb sluts!
- Come on.
-  Okay, there's probably something we should tell you.
Or not.
We could also not.
We have to.
It's the right thing to do.
I tore your dress, and then I lied about it.
And then Brittany and I were the ones who made and sold the T-shirts.
But, we did not keep the money.
Yes, we did.
We kept all the money.
And I'm really sorry.
Okay.
That took a lot of courage - for you to admit that - Mm-hmm.
And I admire your honesty.
You stupid skank!
How could you do that to me?
!
I hate you!
You're both disgusting hogs, and I want you to move out of my apartment forever literally starting right now!
I'm still really glad we told the truth.
Cool.
Okay.
Steamed vegetable medley and ice water.
Can I just get the check?
And can you throw these plants in the trash?
Such a long time now We're doing battle with our own Familiar inhibitions Far away from Home Our trusty compass fails to find This strange and new position Maybe, maybe, maybe we're strong But maybe, maybe, maybe we're strong But maybe, maybe Maybe we're wrong  Damn it.
They're suing you?
!
This chick is claiming she has whiplash.
She wasn't in the car when I hit it!
This is on you.
You should've pretended like you didn't see it and walked away, like everyone else does.
I know!
I've hit your car like six times and never said anything.
But I'm trying to be good!
How is that working out for you?
-  - It's open, dummy.
Eleanor, where have you been?
Oh, hey, man.
Sorry, it's been a crazy month.
You know, moving was a hassle, and I'm in the middle of a lawsuit, and I ate vegetables for the first time, and I got diarrhea for, like, a week.
Uh, I know we don't pay a lot, but this is a job, and we need to know we can count on you.
We're meeting tonight to discuss long-term strategy for the organization.
I really think Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.
Oh, sorry to interrupt whatever boring crap this is, but dude, you need to get dressed.
I got tickets to Taylor Splift.
The Taylor Swift reggae cover band.
They're terrible.
It's gonna be amazing.
Mmm.
Yeah, that sounds like more fun.
- I'ma do that.
- Eleanor!
What?
!
What, dude?
I've been nothing but good for, like, six months, and all I have to show for it is this crummy apartment, a lawsuit, a loose caboose, and an overdrawn bank account.
Being good is for suckers.
What do you even get out of it?
A feeling of fulfillment in your soul.
Gross.
That's the grossest sentence I've ever heard, okay?
I quit.
Eat my farts, Benedict Cumberbatch.
Oof!
I still think he's kinda hot.
I guess.
In like a sick Victorian boy kind of way.
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where we, like, feed him soup.
So tell me about the new business.
We sell classes at a for-profit university, and the classes train people how to sell supplements.
So it's a Ponzi scheme within a Ponzi scheme?
- That sounds kinda dicey.
- Oh, it's super dicey.
But I'm in witness protection, so technically, I can't be convicted of any crime.
Well, that's definitely not true, but I also don't care.
Which one's my desk?
You realize what the problem is, right?
Yes, but there's no way to help.
I'm only giving that guy three stars because he didn't let me stick my head out the moon roof.
Yeah!
Dude, my boyfriend just texted.
His wife's out of town, so I'm gonna head over there.
- Mwah!
- What?
That's lame.
- Boo!
- Happy birthday!
Hello, bartender.
One alcohol drink, please.
It's my birthday, if you want to give it to me for free.
I always say that, but it actually is my birthday.
- Hmm.
- Last year on my birthday, I almost died, and then I did a bunch of stuff that was good, but weird.
And then I stopped.
And now I'm here.
Sounds like you had a pretty crazy year.
- Hm.
- Wanna talk about it?
And in the end, Anthony Anderson and Jerry O'Connell start a successful shampoo company and you see the kangaroo jumping around Australia.
That is the plot of the movie "Kangaroo Jack".
- Why did I tell you that?
- It's unclear.
You know the thing is, the problem really, with being a do-gooder?
- What's that?
- No one cares.
I mean, some people care a little bit.
The twerpy little twerps from the environmental place, they care, but I was a good person for six months.
That's like five years, and it felt okay, but not as good as I thought it would.
And what did I get for it?
Ah, see, now you're talking about moral desert.
Exactly.
Wait, I am?
What?
Moral desert is the concept that if you act with virtue, you deserve a reward.
Right.
If I'm not gonna get rewarded somehow, like a tiara or one of those diagonal award belts - Sash.
- Sure.
Then why should I do good things?
You know, I had a friend that said whenever she was doing something bad, she'd hear this this little voice in her head, distant little voice, saying, "Oh, come on now.
You know this is wrong".
And then when she started doing good things, that voice went away.
It was a relief.
Your friend sounds like she's one pick short of a pickle party.
She's a little rough around the edges, but she was also a really good person, when she tried.
See, I think that little voice was her conscience, trying to guide her in the right direction.
I gotta go home.
What do I owe ya?
The real question, Eleanor, is what do we owe to each other?
What?
Did I sell you a drink?
- Am I a bartender?
-  Drinks are on me.
Good luck.
Ow.
Anybody notice I was gone?
Nope.
What do we owe to each other?
That is the question Tim Scanlon asked decades ago, and it is a question I will try to answer over the next three hours.
Ugh.
No thanks.
We all have a voice in our head.
That voice doesn't tell us what to do or not do, but it does warn us when we do things that don't feel good or right.
The difference between the term "reasonable," what does it mean to be a reasonable person?
I may have a different definition of reasonable so why do it then?
Why choose to be good every day if there is no guaranteed reward we can count on, now or in the afterlife?
I argue that we choose to be good because of our bonds with other people and our innate desire to treat them with dignity.
Simply put, we are not in this alone.
Hey, dong bait, didn't you get my message?
Let's go.
Time is booze.
Yeah, no thanks.
I'm going somewhere else.
G'day.
Where you headed?
St. John's University, please.
No worries.
- Hi.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Office hours are on Tuesday.
Oh, I I'm not a student.
Are you Chidi Ana kendrick?
Anagonye, and yes.
From the long, nerdy video about the little voice that tells you to be good?
From the Cassat Foundation lecture series on the practical applications of ethical theory.
- Yes.
- Great.
Hi.
My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.
Can we talk?
Okay.
Here we go.
